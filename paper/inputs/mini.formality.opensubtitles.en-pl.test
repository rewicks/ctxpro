Hold on a sec.<eos> You're Henry.<eos> Damon told me he saved your life during the war.<eos> So where is he?<eos> I'm going to have to ask you both to leave.
Excuse me, sir.<eos> May I interest you in a rousing tale of heroic deeds and acts of bravery?<eos> It'll pass the time.<eos> Pardon me.<eos> May I transport you for a few minutes with a romantical recitation replete with the tragedy of a love unrequited?
Keep quiet!<eos> Please, sir.<eos> We have until noon.<eos> Please take us.<eos> I'll drive you closer.
So thank you for the sugar and have a nice night.<eos> Well...<eos> Welcome to Crescent Bay, Mr. McKinley.<eos> Any help at all, Mr. McKinley...<eos> I'd see you ladies to the door, but I'm blind.
9:00.<eos> It's just a formality, that's all.<eos> And what about lunch?<eos> We'll be done by lunch. Well--<eos> And we'll get you home right after.
We'll get your Sloan back home.<eos> SWAT and bomb squad just cleared that school.<eos> No sign of your husband. No sign of tampering of any kind.<eos> Where is your husband, Mrs. Yarrow?<eos> I think it's time to put you two women in separate rooms.
100%. All right.<eos> Good. 'cause we're gonna have to risk your freedom to prove it.<eos> How did you feel when you found out that you'd been left off The list for the e.O.D. Unit?<eos> Angry, sir.<eos> Well, you thought maybe that they had made a mistake In passing you over?
- You thinking what I'm thinking? - Yeah.<eos> Gibbs and I are gonna double-check the P.O. boxes, just in case you missed something.<eos> Check-cashing outlets.<eos> Opposite side of town.<eos> I'll be with you in a minute.
All right, Mrs...<eos> Patmore?<eos> She'll be fine.<eos> Thank you.<eos> And you've been sent to us by the Earl of Grantham?
It's gonna be all right.<eos> Madam President... we're still sweeping the West Wing. but we do believe all the hostiles have been accounted for.<eos> Now you and your daughter will stay here until we finish securing the building.<eos> I understand.<eos> Now once we get the all clear, we're going to move you to Andrews Air Force Base.
Welcome to Castle de Orlando, Spanish conquistador. So, I think we should maybe just head...<eos> Tyler, Tyler, I need to talk to you, buddy.<eos> In a minute, Charles.<eos> - No, no, it's very important.<eos> I need to talk to you right now. - Ladies, I'm so sorry.
A spanking! You must spank her well and after you have spanked her, you may deal with her as you like and then...spank me.<eos> - Spank me!<eos> - And me and me!<eos> Yes, yes! You must give us all a good spanking.<eos> I've played all sorts of things with Monty, from sort of young girls to old ladies, from men to nuns to what have you.
And my mum. They're all gone.<eos> God, it's gone by so fast!<eos> You know, danger is the spice of life... and you've got to take a risk every now and again haven't you, son?<eos> You know that's what makes life worthwhile.<eos> And you know, having some nice ladies around can be a big help, mind you.
No.<eos> I-I-I can't even look at them.<eos> 'Kay, fine, I'll do it.<eos> You clean up the puke.<eos> Okay, I'm taking you ladies to bed.
Go where you will, the name of John Thornton in Milton, manufacturer and magistrate, is known and respected amongst all men of business.<eos> And sought after by all the young women in Milton.<eos> Not all of them, surely.<eos> If you had a son like mine, Mrs. Hale, you would not be embarrassed to sing his praises.<eos> If you can bear to visit our dirty, smoky home, we shall receive you next week.
Pinocchio, I really feel sorry for that poor father of yours.<eos> Here are five gold coins.<eos> Take them to your father and give him my best regards.<eos> Oh, five gold coins.<eos> Thank you, most illustrious Sir!
A real one?<eos> Like the Comte de Monte Cristo?<eos> He was not a real one.<eos> To what do we owe the honor ofyour visit?<eos> Well, as mayor of Lansquenet... I want to welcome you to the community and to invite you to worship with us at mass on Sunday.
How much do you think he's worth, couple of million?<eos> After we sell him off, piece by piece, who knows how much we'll make?<eos> - Ah, that got you going.<eos> Now be a good boy and frighten the ladies. Can I have your attention?<eos> Our guest seems to be telling you... - that I'm talking too long.
I'm sorry.<eos> For you.<eos> - How sweet.<eos> - Also...<eos> The President insisted you are paid the remainder of your tenure.
- We saw you pass.<eos> - I made John call the carriage.<eos> - She would not wait.<eos> - We have so little company.<eos> I feel as though I know you already.
You have something to tell me of Mr. Willoughby?<eos> When I quitted Barton last...<eos> No, I must go further back.<eos> No doubt...<eos> No doubt Mrs. Jennings has appraised you of certain events in my past.
Oh, I'd love that.<eos> No, that will not be necessary.<eos> Just show us to our quarters, Captain Picard.<eos> Very well.<eos> We're accommodating you in quarters normally reserved for Starfleet Admiralty.
Have you reservations?<eos> Yes. ln the name of Mr. Augustus Esmond.<eos> -This is Miss Shaw, I'm Miss Lee. -Hi.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> We have been expecting you.
no!<eos> What now? What's that noise?<eos> What's that?<eos> What the hell?<eos> Nice to meet you.
It means...<eos> - How you say?<eos> - Tow truck.<eos> Well, in the spirit of foreign relations,<eos> I'm sure there's no harm in me letting the two of you in.
Welcome to New York.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Mr. Falhadi.<eos> - Right here. And, finally, Mr. Mohada.<eos> My colleague will escort you to your cars.
Watch and learn, Logan. Watch and learn.<eos> Excuse me. There must have been some kind of mistake.<eos> This is our email confirmation.<eos> As you can see, totally bitchin tours doesn't exist.<eos> I believe you've been scammed.
-And where does she live?<eos> -I don't know.<eos> And how do we find out?<eos> In the HR department, they've got her file.<eos> I'll take you there.
And that has created a lot of problems for myself and for my family.<eos> You continually make statements about me and race, Mr. Cochran...<eos> Wait. Wait, all right, stop it, both of you!<eos> This is all improper.<eos> And I'm so mad at both of you guys right now, I'm about to hold the two of you in contempt.
Give me one moment, please.<eos> Can I help you, gentlemen?<eos> Is the bar still open?<eos> - Yes, of course, sir.<eos> - Perfect. Allow me to escort you.
- Excellent to see you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> You know these guys?<eos> Palfrey.<eos> - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.
I'd heard good things about Jason and he was everything people said.<eos> We talked, I explained what I could offer, and then I told him to go enjoy "Satan's Palace IV."<eos> That was the last I saw of him. And we're done.<eos> If there's anything further,<eos> Jeff can put you in touch with my lawyers.
- All right, detective, remember our deal.<eos> Partners on Rykoff.<eos> He starts giving up secrets on Marks, I'm your first phone call.<eos> Right.<eos> Nevada trooper will give you a courtesy escort - to the state line.
Hello, ma'am.<eos> My name is Tom Gregson.<eos> This is Detective Bell.<eos> - We're here...<eos> - I know. I was expecting you.
The man you were when we first met, the man of war, man of dread, his least fighting dog, and now all that you have constructed about yourself now, Drake, is a man of peace, a man of hope...<eos> it's a relief for me to see it.<eos> Just how brittle a carapace that was, how little a man can change.<eos> Inspectors... sir, she has brung herself here.<eos> Uh, Miss Castello, sir. She asks after you.
How about Tasmania?<eos> Sunsets on Cradle Mountain, and I hear Rod Stewart is headlining the Festival of Voices this year.<eos> Much further south.<eos> We want to go to hell.<eos> What makes you think I could get you there?
See you next time.<eos> See you next week.<eos> There's no way a guy like that can make Noriko happy.<eos> We'll start investigating tomorrow.<eos> Please, I'm depending on you.
Just come in.<eos> So, gents, I really hope you'll be able to join us for our benefit... here tomorrow.<eos> It's gonna be a beautiful, star-studded event.<eos> I think you'll really enjoy it.<eos> And for now, I'm gonna leave you in the capable hands of our new Chief Innovations Officer, Dr. Alexandra Panttiere.
- I was in the wrong line.<eos> - Excuse me, what's the problem here?<eos> No, I'm not going to America.<eos> - I'm staying in Canada.<eos> - All right, gentlemen, please, I need you to back away.
No, I will kill you!<eos> I won't forgive you for ruining my sister!<eos> Yes, we've seen the script.<eos> Please, let me introduce my actor here.<eos> Nice to meet you.
Brothers, yeah?<eos> Yes, sir, that's us.<eos> Kansas City.<eos> What's this about, Sheriff, if I'm okay to ask?<eos> Now, if I were to search you three, would I find weapons?
And even if she can't guess who did it, she'll still be ashamed of the cat which is her cat.<eos> That wasn't the real murder. How could this beauty, so perfect and out of reach, unite with me through lying?<eos> - May I?<eos> - Y es, come in.<eos> This is to tell you, to tempt you...
There'll be the same 7% transaction fee.<eos> Not a problem.<eos> My assistant will take your details and draw up the contracts.<eos> - OK. - We'll wait here.<eos> - It was a pleasure meeting you.
Gorev came through.<eos> The meeting with the generals is back on.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Do me a favor... don't screw this up.<eos> Gentlemen, it's a pleasure to finally meet you all.
Based on the scribble on your cup, I see you got the Kopi Luwak.<eos> It's harvested in Indonesia from the defecation of the cat-like palm civet.<eos> And about mom, Pippy, and TMI's seating arrangement in court, I took care of that.<eos> Gentlemen?<eos> They're ready for you.
I can see you're very busy.<eos> Perhaps we could just go and check.<eos> There are over two million letters, diaries and artefacts up in our archive, meticulously filed, and they don't stay that way by letting strange men and their bears rummage around.<eos> - Listen...<eos> - I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
Not nearly enough.<eos> Bring her along tonight.<eos> We won't go otherwise.<eos> I'll be sure to ask.<eos> A pleasure to have met you both.
Gentlemen.<eos> I'd like you to meet the director of the conference, Dr. Barbara Walcott.<eos> And, Barbara, this is Dr. Pinchelow and his associate, Dr. Christmas.<eos> Wonderful.<eos> It is a high honor to meet you both.
He's fine.<eos> Look, I... Right. I should probably tell you...<eos> OK, I...<eos> There.<eos> Doesn't mean I'm not pleased to see you.
Come in, please.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> So...<eos> Mr. Jian Ji Ye and Mr. Xuequin.<eos> I wanted to meet you because I plan... to audit your company's earnings over two years.
Well, we report to Miss Figueroa.<eos> Right, well, I believe I can provide more information. Miss Figueroa wasn't on campus that evening.<eos> We have instructions to meet with her exclusively.<eos> We'll interview you along with the other COs when the time comes.<eos> Sure, sure. I'll show you to her office.
I am presenting my new previa procedure at the next meeting.<eos> I see you're also on the list of speakers.<eos> May I ask what it is you'll be presenting?<eos> I'd rather not say.<eos> It was nice meeting you all.
He just finished a two-year stint for grand theft auto.<eos> Thanks for coming in, Officer Fowler.<eos> I'm Special Agent Seeley Booth.<eos> This here is Dr. Sweets.<eos> Nice to meet you.
Anyone, my love? Not at all.<eos> Well there's a, there's a few scraps here that... -we could...<eos> -Horace.<eos> There's nothing left.<eos> Good morrow, and welcome you both to our house of curiosities. May I perhaps interest you...
All right, time to make the move.<eos> All right, there's going to be some sirens in this bitch.<eos> I'll go shake the weasel. Alright, shake the weasel.<eos> Shake the weasel.<eos> Hey, good morning, sir. How are you?
I run that account now.<eos> Anyhow, I'll let you get back to it.<eos> Sorry again to interrupt.<eos> No problem.<eos> Very nice to meet you both.
Certainly not your attitude when we posted you there.<eos> I believe it's the right place for me... and the right time.<eos> And I agree.<eos> And you handled this whole episode most commendably, Colonel.<eos> I'll leave you to your coffee.
It was the dog or me, Mike.<eos> Sugar died a hero.<eos> Mr. Alzate is a fantastic storyteller.<eos> Yes. Quite an animal lover, too.<eos> Well, it was a pleasure meeting both of you.
Those are nice moves.<eos> CBI.<eos> I'm Agent Cho, this is Patrick Jane.<eos> Chief here in Elliston.<eos> Good to meet you. This way.
You might benefit from his professional opinion.<eos> The perpetrator of these crimes clearly exhibits a profoundly disturbed psyche.<eos> Indeed.<eos> I'm sure I'm not telling you anything you don't know.<eos> What may be less obvious to you, perhaps, is that he will also be highly functioning.
I don't know.<eos> Someone with a grudge, perhaps?<eos> Sir, I'm a successful man. I have more enemies than I do friends.<eos> I-I'm sorry. It...<eos> It is probably nothing. But I just thought it best to inform you.
alluring candle. As the higher the price, the greater the temptation.<eos> Potential criminals who may be dazzled by the enormity of the price must be taught that the punishment they risk will be proportionately greater.<eos> I therefore find myself faced with the unenviable duty of pronouncing grave sentences.<eos> Charles Frederick Wilson, Roy John James, Ronald Arthur Biggs,<eos> Douglas Gordon Goody, you will go to prison for concurrent terms of 25 years on the first count and 30 years on the second...
I'll be seeing you.<eos> No wooden nickels, huh?<eos> - Mr. Kessler.<eos> - Yes? We're with the Bureau of Investigation.<eos> - Gentlemen, I assure you...
And Professor Franklin, Professor of Physics, Case Western University of Ohio.<eos> Doctor.<eos> Now, if you don't mind--<eos> There's another guest here, isn't that right?<eos> Yes, that--that is right. Excuse me, I--I didn't introduce you formally.
He is have breakfast at salon Richelieu.<eos> - Richelieu?<eos> Damn, what class.<eos> We always hang out in the Georges Moustaki.<eos> I'll pass. - Thank you.
- I don't like it.<eos> I really don't feel well.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Okay. Meet me in Africa.<eos> Mr. Baxter will see you now.
Sister Monica Joan.<eos> Is known to them as, and I quote, "light-fingered", and has a habit of stealing small items from their stalls.<eos> That is a serious accusation, Sergeant.<eos> It will have to be proved or disproved.<eos> I will escort you upstairs.
Why are we here?<eos> How is this getting us any closer to Mr Edwards' killer?<eos> Well, that's the beauty of holistic detection, MacDuff.<eos> We're getting closer, even when it appears we are moving further away.<eos> Mr Brown will see you now.
So, if you want to hit me again... Ow!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Is everything all right?<eos> Great.<eos> We're ready for you.
He's been on inhalers, but he started to feel a lot of pain.<eos> A doctor will be with you in a minute.<eos> Um, ma'am, can I take this?<eos> It's private.<eos> I can't leave you in here alone.
'Fraid so.<eos> Good luck. Steve?<eos> Oh. Oh, you know what? This is the manager of the building.<eos> Man thinks I work for him.<eos> I'll show you out in a second.
Twitter. No more "ding-dong, the bitch is dead."<eos> Now it's all, "we pray for Kelly's safe return."<eos> You still think this is a PR stunt.<eos> Working, isn't it?<eos> She'll see you now.
I'm Nadine, the personal concierge.<eos> We're all devastated to learn about Sam.<eos> We're supposed to meet Sam's business partner-- - Charlie Turner.<eos> We need to talk to him about one of your employees.<eos> He asked me to escort you to his table. Follow me.
Marlinspike Hall.<eos> Those coordinates lead here.<eos> And this is where Sir Francis hid it?<eos> I thought the treasure went down with the ship.<eos> Master Haddock, Mr. Tintin, I've been expecting you.
To the drunk tank.<eos> I'm innocent.<eos> It's the big bird that did it.<eos> I was just going home.<eos> Gentlemen, until we find out more about this tragedy, I'm relying on you to keep this case confidential.
Trust me, if I had the $1,000, I would've lent it to him myself...<eos> And probably got it back, $10 a week.<eos> I don't know where he went, but, I mean, after six weeks, I had no choice. I had to take him off the payroll and clear out his locker.<eos> Uh, I'd love to take a look at his things.<eos> Sure, I-I'll have Sharon take you down.
It's yourjob, Jean-Luc.<eos> SEMINAR CLAVEL<eos> But it's not enough.<eos> Keep in mind thatwe can always do better.<eos> Good evening. Nice to have you here.
You enjoying the party?<eos> Very much. Thank you.<eos> Liar.<eos> If you see my wife, tell her I love her, Hmm?<eos> It was nice meeting you.
- I don't remember... Do you have a family?<eos> - Not yet.<eos> I have a wife.<eos> Well, Howard is my son.<eos> He's gonna be part of this from now on, starting with taking you two gentlemen on a tour.
I know everything about you. You are a very impressive young woman.<eos> Why, thank you.<eos> I was just writing copy. - As you were.<eos> - I hope we chat later.<eos> Mr. Draper is waiting for you in Mr. Cooper's office.
I'm here on the side, where are you?<eos> I'm here...<eos> Senior Mecias.<eos> Senior Ortiz.<eos> Nice to meet you both.
I have Colonel Stauffenberg for General Fromm.<eos> Colonel Stauffenberg, sir. Welcome back to the War Ministry.<eos> - It's an honor, sir. - You're an old woman, Fromm!<eos> I'd send you to the front if I didn't think you'd surrender just to be Montgomery's whore!<eos> The General will see you now.
In the '80s perhaps, when AIDS victims paid off by dying quickly.<eos> You bought my client's policy when he was circling the drain.<eos> You made what you thought was a sure bet, and now that it's turned out otherwise, you renege.<eos> You've breached a contract, Mr Winthrop, and in so doing, have made it impossible for my client to afford his medication.<eos> You very well may hasten his death, but hey, I'm sure the jury will find you quite sympathetic.
- It's like they were.<eos> /Mr. Daniel, Mr. Gerardo.<eos> Do you copy me?<eos> /<eos> - The cops are asking for you.
No offense,eppes,but you're supposed to work that stuff out for them.<eos> How do you suppose I do that?<eos> You start by knocking their their heads together,and then you move on from there.<eos> My way is,I give them enough room,and,hopefully,things work out for themselves.<eos> Mr. Piennar is waiting for you in the vault.
Like I said before... my husband and I respectfully plead the 5th.<eos> Hey, chief, why does she keep calling that boy her husband?<eos> I don't know, Ward, and I don't care.<eos> Well, we actually got married last week.<eos> Nice to meet you, by the way.
"Marty the Beaver. "<eos> Hey.<eos> This guy is so not gonna go for this.<eos> Pessimist son of a bitch.<eos> Mr. Planck will be with you in just one minute, gentlemen.
The Sons Of The Twice Born?<eos> What in heaven's name...?<eos> It's just a group of friends.<eos> It was a long time ago.<eos> Why on earth is it of interest to you?
This is an administrative warrant.<eos> It's not valid in this situation.<eos> That's your opinion.<eos> They're in the media room.<eos> I'll show you.
I'm not going in there without him.<eos> - Be reasonable, E.<eos> - Blow me.<eos> That's not very nice.<eos> Jacqueline's ready for you.
You know what?<eos> Just get to the meeting.<eos> Don't even call me back.<eos> This is so fucked.<eos> All right, Mr. Kane's ready for you.
But don't worry, honey, you only need one to live.<eos> How is she?<eos> I'm Dr. McNamara, this is Dr. Troy.<eos> Dr. Cruz works for us.<eos> Nice to meet you.
Little John old cock, What say we give this charming creature a role in "Sally's Punishment"?<eos> I bet she's a dab hand with the cords.<eos> Could you stop there, please?<eos> These films include bondage, spanking and flagellation, all illegal to send through the U.S. mails.<eos> I will need you to sign a stipulation stating that you will agree not to sell any films, photographs or drawings depicting these acts.
Sir, Rahul is here.<eos> He has an appointment with Mr Dushyant<eos> Send him over.<eos> I'll see him in the room outside<eos> Mr Rajpal is Mr Dushyant's secretary. He'll see you in Room No 401
After doing so cut off all the lines.<eos> It should leak from here as late as possible.<eos> Do you think that he...<eos> Yes.<eos> - Shall I take you to the airport?
If there's another deal up for grabs, I'd like to hear about it.<eos> - Tony?<eos> - Absolutely, yes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> My car will pick you up tomorrow morning.
Welcome to Hard Rock.<eos> My name is Amy.<eos> Which one of you is Mr. Cohen? Hi, Amy, we spoke on the phone.<eos> It's good to see you.<eos> Yes, good to see you. We have the penthouse all ready for you.

And for five weeks... all evidence of what he was doing managed to elude the entire command staff?<eos> Are you kidding, Commissioner?<eos> I take full responsibility, and indeed... after I first learned of the matter, I informed the Mayor... and together we moved immediately... to relieve Major Colvin of his command.<eos> I'm under the impression that... this administration gave serious consideration... to proceeding with Colvin's initiative.<eos> No, sir. Major Colvin informed you of his effort at a COMSTAT meeting... more than a week ago.
- I do.<eos> - Lonnie Shaver.<eos> Manager here?<eos> - All day.<eos> - Ernie Strode. - I'm gonna put you...
Do I look presentable?<eos> I haven't worn this in a decade.<eos> Rather snug around the midriff.<eos> And bow.<eos> The divine Emperor Meiji bids you welcome.
It's over for them.<eos> They've shuffled off, cleanly, the one time.<eos> Nobody's shoving them back in this world against their will.<eos> I mind.<eos> Mr. Hainsley has asked that I send you back to Wolfram Hart, gentlemen.
We're going deep-sea fishing as a Marlin or waiting.<eos> Lieutenant.<eos> If this is another insult to my father and us.<eos> Lieutenant Caine.<eos> I would like to apologize to you gentlemen for any inconvenience I caused you.
Calm the fuck down.<eos> No.<eos> Sorry.<eos> My cousin Ronny, he's a little special.<eos> Let me show you in.
I'll call you back later.<eos> Inspector Richard, we are very sorry.. that the operation was sabotaged.<eos> I will report back to my superiors and get you any help I can.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Let me show you out.
Aye, aye, sir.<eos> You there, get aloft to clear that tackle.<eos> SAWYER: Get below, Mr. Wellard.<eos> You, too, Mr. Hornblower.<eos> I'll teach you to conspire and try to make me a laughing- stock in front of the men.
These people here look like Alan Mowbray.<eos> I mean, they're sort of tall, and they don't say too much.<eos> And they have fucking British accents, right?<eos> They talk like they're from England.<eos> - Good evening. We've been expecting you.
Not yours, ma'am. Neither of yours. US$ 1,940 million.<eos> I'll take ten.<eos> Do you want back in, Sir?<eos> Is that a yes? No? The Stradivarius now at US$ 1,940 million.<eos> US$ 1,950 on my left. Down to you two.
You may not be familiar with our customs... but things work like this down here, in the real world.<eos> - Well, the real world sucks.<eos> - It does have its perks.<eos> Gentlemen, I'm Ms. Kegel, executive assistant to Mr. Mars.<eos> Let me be the first to welcome you to the globotech family.
Gentlemens!<eos> Very nice to see you tonight. You look very nice.<eos> K-i-r-k. - Hi, kirk. - I'm Joe.<eos> - I'm Gus. Gus.<eos> Nice to see you, Gus. Nice to see you tonight.
But, first of all, do you know what cryonization is?<eos> Well, more or less.<eos> Here are some leaflets.<eos> You can read them while you're waiting.<eos> One of my colleagues will be with you soon.
Sure, Jerry.<eos> We're all set. Why wouldn't we be?<eos> Yeah, no, I'm sure you are.<eos> Shep vouched for you and all.<eos> I got every confidence here in you fellas.
That car should be hot, plates stolen.<eos> I have a feeling that the man we're after doesn't operate that way.<eos> Detective Lieutenant Bletcher, Seattle PD.<eos> We'd like to ask you a few questions.<eos> I've been expecting you.
I hope you're wrong, my boy.<eos> I especially wanted to see Count Dracula tonight.<eos> I wonder if he suspects something.<eos> Good evening.<eos> - Did I startle you?
I beseech Your Lordships both to pardon me.<eos> His Majesty has strictly given me charge that no man shall have private conference, of what degree soever, with your brother.<eos> We speak no treason, Brackenbury.<eos> We say the King is wise and virtuous and his Queen... Well-struck in years.<eos> I beseech you both to pardon me.
I would like to say, I know the American people will join me in sending their hopes and prayers to the MacLeish family during this time of sorrow.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> All right, folks, that's all we have for now, okay?<eos> The President's obviously not taking any questions.<eos> Look, I'm gonna be updating you every hour as we have new developments.
I will make that happen.<eos> What is this place? Welcome.<eos> Do you have a reservation with us this evening?<eos> - Yes, under Rhoades.<eos> - Of course, yes. Mr. and Mrs. Rhoades. We've been expecting you.
If not a little bit tragic.<eos> That may be too.<eos> Like most things, it depends on one's perspective.<eos> This is the Clios vault now.<eos> I'll leave you here, so you can view in privacy.
Maladroit. I believe the word you're searching for is "blunderer."<eos> Oui. Who apparently abused article five of the NATO charter by asking us to assist him in going after the wrong target.<eos> As I said earlier, Madame, I am not at liberty to comment on that any further than I already have.<eos> Then France proposes tabling any discussion of the U.S. initiative until the president can say more and does.<eos> All I can do... is ask you all, please... please do not allow my nation's domestic issues to interfere with our global objectives.
Wunderbar!<eos> Now, schnell, schnell.<eos> Go on, quickly. You're a very naughty Valkyrie.<eos> We now come to the finale of our evening.<eos> I should warn you that the vision you're about to witness will be both shocking and terrifying.
Pardon me.<eos> I want to say something to the entire community.<eos> Mr. Simpson is a fugitive of justice.<eos> And if any of you assist him, in any way, you are committing a felony.<eos> And I personally guarantee you will be prosecuted.
Well, I adore it and I'm bloody sophisticated!<eos> Taiwan.<eos> - How was the ride in, sir?<eos> - Noisy. It can be terribly bumpy up there, even on a clear night.<eos> Heroic of you to venture aloft at all, if you ask me.
On it you will visit every stop she visited with the defendant on his cold, calculating itinerary that night, which started with a stolen car in Queens, and ended with a young woman brutally stabbed to death in her bed.<eos> Before I take you on this tour through hell, a word to the wise.<eos> Be not distracted by Mr. Khan's benign appearance as he sits here with us in his dress shirt and tie, nor by attempts by his attorneys to linger on the victim's personal struggles in her all-too-brief life.<eos> This case isn't about Andrea's life. It's about her death.<eos> Mrs. Weiss... she prefers to be called "missus," gets to take you on her tour before I can take you on mine.
Let go!<eos> - Molly! Oop!<eos> - Let go of me! No!<eos> - I'm afraid that that is all the time that I have.<eos> Sarah will show you out.
- Oh... Don't look!<eos> - As her legal guardian... - Yeah, I understand.<eos> I understand.<eos> I talked to the hospital lawyers.<eos> She simply isn't responding to the name you gave.
Pulverizing opponents is not his habit but a talent.<eos> His eyes have spark.<eos> His arms are like rocks.<eos> One of his tackles equals ten of others.<eos> Haryana Sports Festival sponsored by Astral Pipes... welcomes you all to this mega wrestling bout.
You work with us, you stay on as AG.<eos> You don't, we prosecute.<eos> Ladies and Gentlemen, the First Lady of the United States.<eos> Good afternoon, everyone.<eos> I'd like to update you on my husband's recovery.
- You killed him!<eos> - I saw him in his coffin...<eos> - Please remove that young man now.<eos> He was my dad, and now he's gone!<eos> I'm now instructing each and every one of you to disregard that outburst and to not let it influence your opinions on this case.
Ten years ago.<eos> I was working at a hotel in Dieppe.<eos> You were on holiday there.<eos> All the guests were watching you, secretly talking about you.<eos> I took up some service for you both one afternoon.
But I always tried... why are you crying, anyways?<eos> Wait, where are you going?<eos> Linda, come back...<eos> Sorry, I have to stop the play.<eos> I apologize to you all.
Why didn't he tell me himself?<eos> He thought he had time.<eos> But he did leave a video will to explain.<eos> We will need a copy.<eos> Oh, absolutely. But trust me, I think you'll find nothing in there that's a motive for murder.
Oh, good!<eos> Listen, let me go get my makeup caboodle, and I'll be back in a jiffy!<eos> If I were you, I'd make a run for it.<eos> We'll be starting the service in just a few minutes.<eos> I'd like to invite you to make your way into the chapel.
I wasn't your enemy.<eos> None of us was.<eos> Don't let it upset you, okay?<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking.<eos> On behalf of our Alitalia crew, we'd like to welcome you aboard this flight to Rome Fiumicino.
Don't let the target escape the X.<eos> Stand by. Stand by.<eos> Confirm Tango 1 on the move.<eos> Calvary is a go.<eos> ...and the crew, we'd like to welcome you aboard this flight to London.
Am I ready to let him go?<eos> Truth is... every day I've worn that name I've hated him a little more.<eos> I've been ready to return him to the sea for a long time.<eos> James...<eos> They're ready for you downstairs.
You fixed it.<eos> It's our duty to help fellow companions.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> - Goodbye.<eos> Can I drop you somewhere?

I shan't hinder your advances.<eos> Zilpha. My love. My love.<eos> This is a holy man of God.<eos> He's practised in removing and discouraging demons.<eos> Your husband reports a Barbason has been visiting you.
The only people who would benefit from your death are the Americans, but you're already in negotiations with the Americans, so surely once the boards have gone we could put curtains up.<eos> You seem to know such a lot for somebody who knows so very little.<eos> You should know that I am a very dangerous man.<eos> I was told that, too.<eos> And who keeps telling you all this shit?
There will be a performance or there will be a riot in Covent Garden.<eos> Until the necessary arrangements have been made, I advise that you go absolutely nowhere.<eos> As of now, you are a weakness.<eos> These fantasies elude me...<eos> If you go outside, they will find you and they will find a use for you.
The price was two sovereigns.<eos> I'm not a courtesan.<eos> But we are here and there is a room with a bed and fire.<eos> Now this gentleman is a Duke.<eos> He asked for you particularly and he was told by your theatre manager you would comply.
That bitch is on the gallows... before Mass!<eos> Down there.<eos> Perhaps now you will listen to me.<eos> This diamond... this is yours.<eos> I have a man that will take you to Paris and you will stay there until this business is done.
That's a great name, Quincy.<eos> I was named after my grandfather's dog.<eos> The legacy lives on.<eos> - Don't touch me.<eos> - Yeah. And where did you say you met Celeste?
I arrived ten days ago on the inaugural Lufthansa flight.<eos> With Goebbels and Goering.<eos> You must be important.<eos> Yet you just walked away from the scene of a crime.<eos> I saw you.
Thank God.<eos> I thought I'd had it.<eos> We're not out of the building yet.<eos> Have you heard from Douglas Archer?<eos> He did ring... just to enquire about you.
Yet they have the same hobbies, they wear the same clothes, they have the same hairstyle, even down to the same type of dog, but you are suggesting something so much more.<eos> DR. CONNELLY: Well, something deeper in their DNA.<eos> My research has shown in some cases these types of twins can share some of the same emotions and memories due to synaptic, possibly even telepathic, convergence.<eos> SPEAKER:<eos> That's interesting. What made you go down that path?
Dr. Harber, before we're live,<eos> I just wanted to say thank you for choosing me.<eos> Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.<eos> The rich history you have with other journalists...<eos> I chose you precisely because we don't have a history.
He just arrived today.<eos> Unfortunately Governor Odegard speaks no Russian... but luckily Major Potemkin has a little English so he can follow our conversation.<eos> Oh, good.<eos> Very good.<eos> So, what brings you to Vukobejina, Governor?
Or I was Chief.<eos> Or, no, I still am.<eos> Anyway... I thought in the spirit of inter-collegial understanding...<eos> See, I'm in town looking into a homicide, and the victim spent some time here, back in the '70s.<eos> Okay, I'll tell you what. The plate number checks out, I'll come find you.
Uh... I was just still saving up for the materials.<eos> I should have asked if it was okay if I slept here.<eos> If I pay for the materials, will that help?<eos> I can't... I can't let you do that.<eos> I've already cost you so much.
Hold on.<eos> You're on speaker.<eos> Mr. Murphy, can you hear me? Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I can... Yeah. That's it.<eos> Yeah, I can... Yeah, I can hear you.
- Agent Thoms?<eos> - Ma'am, are you safe?<eos> If you're asking if this was my idea, the answer is "yes."<eos> Then please ask Mrs. Diehl to pull over.<eos> We have a vehicle on the way that will return you to the compound.
If you're asking if this was my idea, the answer is "yes."<eos> Then please ask Mrs. Diehl to pull over.<eos> We have a vehicle on the way that will return you to the compound.<eos> I'm not going back.<eos> Under Chapter 18, United States Code 3056, it is illegal for you to deny protection, ma'am.
I'm not going back.<eos> Under Chapter 18, United States Code 3056, it is illegal for you to deny protection, ma'am.<eos> I am not denying protection.<eos> You are free to escort me back to New York.<eos> Neither Mrs. Diehl nor her vehicle are equipped to transport you safely.
No.<eos> I really should get going.<eos> You've given me a lot to think about.<eos> Not the easiest conversation I've ever had.<eos> I think they're waiting for you.
No, I can't.<eos> But I want to thank the dedicated people who looked after my safety and the safety of this great city.<eos> There are some reports suggesting that you yourself were the target of the attack.<eos> Well, I'd rather wait for the results of the investigation before commenting on that.<eos> The president is urging you and Congress to reauthorize certain provisions of the PATRIOT Act.
Your staff will be brought up separately.<eos> Brought where?<eos> Where are we going?<eos> They'll tell us when we're airborne, ma'am.<eos> I'll catch up with you.
Dar's here.<eos> He's in the building.<eos> Not too late to cancel.<eos> The meeting's been scheduled.<eos> I can sub in for you.
On your toes. She's about to hit the garage.<eos> What about the rest of my staff?<eos> They're coming down the east stairwell, ma'am, and evacuating through the back entrance.<eos> I can't leave without them.<eos> Ma'am, my orders are to put you in this vehicle.
- To see the President.<eos> Ronald, I need to see the President.<eos> - She's not available.<eos> - It's urgent.<eos> Ma'am, we've been ordered to escort you out of the building. - Ordered?
Welcome, Madam President-Elect.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So, let me ask you what everyone is asking right now-- why are you here?<eos> Because you invited me.<eos> Well, I've often invited you, but, usually, you prefer the loving arms of the mainstream media.
How's it feeling?<eos> Can you wiggle your fingers, make a fist?<eos> Good as new.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Miss Durst, I'm sorry if this seems inappropriate, but when you came in last month to get the cast, one of the orderlies, he said he saw you in the parking lot before you came in.
- Just for five minutes.<eos> - I'm waiting for a bus.<eos> Please! I'll be in and out, I swear.<eos> I really need this job.<eos> - Um... - I'm begging you.
I know her!<eos> Miss Durst.<eos> Yes?<eos> Go on up.<eos> They're waiting for you.
And if you see him, tell him we said hello and that Finland won the World Cup.<eos> What did she say?<eos> Dr. Bekker is...<eos> Dr. Bekker thinks you have no intention of using the device.<eos> Um, she believes that you're curious, but once the time comes, you will get... How do you say... Cold feet.
I wonder, ma'am, if he might want you to leave.<eos> Especially... when he learns of your... current state of being.<eos> I beg your pardon, ma'am, but seeing what I see in your service...<eos> I fear there are things I may know about you that even the governor does not yet know.<eos> I have grown quite fond of you, ma'am.
- One, two, three.<eos> - John.<eos> - Senator, back up.<eos> They need to work, they need to work.<eos> We're gonna take good care of you, all right?
- Two of the goons were rentals.<eos> They'll go in, sweep the room, then head back out here.<eos> Ms. Facchini.<eos> Mr. Bohm.<eos> I was hoping it'd be you.
- Ruining lives.<eos> - My God!<eos> You're him. You're Alexander.<eos> Well, I'm flattered you remember me.<eos> I remember you, of course.
- I'm not afraid.<eos> You will be, in the end.<eos> I think that's him.<eos> Get after him! I'll take care of her.<eos> It's all right! I'll get you out!
Not exactly a breach, no.<eos> Then what was it?<eos> Ms. Walker, this is Vanessa Anders.<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> Ms. Anders, it is such an honor and a pleasure to meet you.
Hey, Miss Viola.<eos> Sorry. I'm Tyler.<eos> I'm a friend of your stepdaughter's.<eos> Oh, is that right?<eos> Yeah, I didn't wanna interrupt you. Thought I'd introduce myself and welcome you to the neighborhood.
Why you?<eos> What do you mean, "Why me"?<eos> I mean, you're a district attorney.<eos> And he's a stool pigeon.<eos> Why would Mr. Boss think he could draw out Mr. Deaux by kidnapping you?
But those are humans I know and trust.<eos> Clive has already witnessed a full-scale zombie outbreak.<eos> That's a genie that can't really be put back in a bottle.<eos> We want to know what you mean when you talk about Seattle being a zombie homeland.<eos> How can we know if we're with you when we don't even really know what we're talking about?
- Uh, yeah, you'd be surprised how many people want to get inked first thing in the morning.<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> Stop.<eos> It... It was great to meet you.<eos> You too.
Thank you. But there was to be no publicity.<eos> It is dangerous for you to be here.<eos> Can't you see the graffiti?<eos> It'll only take a few minutes.<eos> We'll be done. And one of my colleagues is here to discuss some security arrangements with you so you'll feel safer.
Okay, no problem. Thanks. Hi.<eos> I, uh, I called earlier about a missing U.S. citizen<eos> - in the Middle East. - Yes.<eos> I'm Henry Kishida.<eos> Let me walk you to the director's office.
Please, if every criminal in the state was allowed to file suit because their D.A. was being<eos> - a little overzealous...<eos> - Look at my face.<eos> Do you not think this constitutes a lawsuit?<eos> I'm sorry. Are you now claiming A.D.A. Atwood physically assaulted you?
Where's his justice?<eos> We'll see you at the grand jury.<eos> We can hit you back, Ms. Winterbottom.<eos> This office has files on everyone in Ms. Keating's life.<eos> You, her students...
Things that I thought would make her happy.<eos> I must have made her life so hard.<eos> And I always thought that we would be... best friends, but I don't know who is sleeping in Allison's old room right now.<eos> He's the same person that he's always been.<eos> And he... loves you.
And if he'd been willing to talk, you'd be thrown in the brig right now.<eos> But he wasn't.<eos> That's how martian he is.<eos> Current appearances to the contrary, he is one of the toughest dusters I've served with.<eos> So this is about you.
So this is about you.<eos> We trained all our lives for this.<eos> Now it's here and we just want to use it.<eos> The sooner we have it out with earth the better.<eos> Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you.
No brain damage?<eos> She was dirsorientated and violent. I had no time to examine her.<eos> But, wasn't she effectively on life-support?<eos> It's a miracle, Doctor Yelburton.<eos> Why did she attack you?
I don't understand how he got rid of his tattoo.<eos> Good news, I managed to get through to the local sheriff's department.<eos> It seems there's an escaped cow from a local dairy farm giving them the runaround, but they assured me they'll send someone as soon as they're able.<eos> They must have made quick work of that cow.<eos> May I help you, ma'am?
And there are strict rules governing conflict that I cannot break, so...<eos> Then let's make this an unofficial consultation.<eos> Are there things I can do today to protect myself?<eos> Would I be wise to consider extreme measures, separation, divorce?<eos> I'm going to have to ask you to pick up the money and put it back in your bag.
I repeat, what?<eos> You guys have been kind of closed off all day, and everyone's starting to wonder, and I was sort of elected...<eos> I elected myself to find out...<eos> Let's take a walk.<eos> Seems to me that you will be in for plenty of scrutiny, too, with a prosecution in the offing, if you're sticking around.
Blanche.<eos> You aren't ever gonna sell this house.<eos> And you aren't ever gonna leave it either.<eos> Mamacita, they loved it.<eos> They loved you, Miss Joan.
Archie, he wouldn't miss it.<eos> I had to beg him to let me come. Great.<eos> I'll see you at school, Ms. Grundy.<eos> Let's go, Dad.<eos> Well, I was thinkin' that, you know, if you're gonna be alone tonight, that we could take you out to dinner.
- Yeah.<eos> - Right.<eos> Um... Can I get their names?<eos> Seaside High, Centreville High.<eos> What made you leave?
You're the national security advisor, right?<eos> You advise the president on which foreign leaders to meet with and where.<eos> You're a smart one, aren't you?<eos> You put the president of the United States in Seattle with the Ukrainian president.<eos> Or maybe he asked you to.
Well, we all need a "Middle of the night" rate sometimes.<eos> So where are you joining us from, Miss Samuels?<eos> Los Angeles?<eos> That's a very busy place?<eos> What brings you up to white pine bay?
Are you still here?<eos> Um, I know this is a weird request, but can I please take a look at your registry?<eos> Why?<eos> I've been here before. No, I...<eos> I don't think so. I would have remembered checking you in.
We got a few more here, come on.<eos> So sorry. We are out.<eos> We will open up tomorrow at 8:00 AM.<eos> Stay back!<eos> Your new boss wants to see you.
So sorry. We are out.<eos> We will open up tomorrow at 8:00 AM.<eos> Stay back!<eos> Your new boss wants to see you.<eos> He's expecting you.
The earth under my feet is shaking.<eos> It's not the earth, your legs are shaking.<eos> But Tara, we did all the calculations.<eos> Excuse me, ma'am...<eos> Dr. Sheriyar is calling you.
Now, let's have a listen to baby's heartbeat.<eos> Then blood pressure, urine sample, and we'll book you in for a home visit.<eos> Oh, I shan't be at home.<eos> I'm to go to St Cuthbert's for my caesarean.<eos> We'll want to see you regularly now, and, well, it'll save you the journey.
But you're here now.<eos> What's happening?<eos> I'm putting this Nil-By-Mouth sign over your bed, Mrs Venables, because in the morning you're going to be having an operation.<eos> Are they going to put that stitch in?<eos> Mr Kenley has decided you're a prime candidate for cervical cerclage.
You have an abscess, Mrs Williams.<eos> A serious infection beneath your tooth.<eos> I will prescribe you painkillers and a course of penicillin.<eos> I want this cleared up before baby makes an appearance.<eos> I'll also refer you to the dental department at the hospital.
A serious infection beneath your tooth.<eos> I will prescribe you painkillers and a course of penicillin.<eos> I want this cleared up before baby makes an appearance.<eos> I'll also refer you to the dental department at the hospital.<eos> Hopefully, the dentist can see you immediately.
- Well done, sweetie.<eos> - Mrs Williams, it's very important you come to the hospital as soon as you can.<eos> Why? What you going to do to me?<eos> Just look inside your mouth again, using my instruments, and in better light.<eos> Nurse Franklin can come along and hold your hand again, if you would like.
How many?<eos> Given the extent of your gum disease, I think all of them.<eos> All of them?<eos> And, bearing in mind how poorly you've been feeling, the sooner the better.<eos> I'm going to put you to sleep and while you're dreaming of lovely things, I will deal with everything.
Afternoon, Mrs Turner.<eos> I'm sorry I'm late, but this is Mrs Farah.<eos> She's due any day, but hasn't been to the clinic yet.<eos> Of course.<eos> Let's see if we can jump you up the queue, Mrs Farah.
Okay.<eos> Follow me.<eos> Yes.<eos> Here's the file you requested.<eos> Agent Sanders, they want you upstairs.
You have the right to speak to an attorney...<eos> - Ms. James, are you okay?<eos> - She's okay.<eos> We just need to get her out of here.<eos> We've got a squad car to take you to the hospital, okay?
Excuse me?<eos> Oh, gosh.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I didn't mean to bother you.<eos> - Do I know you?
Is he gonna be all right?<eos> He's a tough kid, and he's young.<eos> We can bring him back.<eos> Sure.<eos> Boss wants to see you.
Yeah. Patch me through to Webster.<eos> Call list is a mile long and growing.<eos> You want me to go over it with you now or...<eos> Later.<eos> Okay, but everyone's asking for you.
Part of his temporal lobe has been effectively erased. The part that governs empathy.<eos> - Is his condition reversible?<eos> - I'm afraid not.<eos> The sooner we have it out with earth the better.<eos> Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you.
- Yes, sir.<eos> Well, obviously, as a woman of taste and good manners, you find gossip abhorrent.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> I can't stand it.<eos> Then I should warn you in advance, because you were the one who brought up Dobby Tucker.
Everything I do is in service to your family.<eos> You included.<eos> In that case...<eos> I require a list of all the women with whom my husband has fraternised behind my back, every sordid little story that you've helped to hide.<eos> Your husband loves you very much.
People? What people?<eos> Right now, they think I'm here acting as your friend.<eos> Gathering information, finding out if you are involved in something bigger.<eos> I don't... I don't believe you, they could be anyone.<eos> Well, just remember I tried to warn you. I did that much at least.
And I also wanted you to know I have spoken with Lieutenant Billets.<eos> She's capable but been at Hollywood a long time.<eos> Her guys adore her, but that's not always a positive.<eos> I've been trying to tighten things up since I came on board.<eos> You and Billets have a personal connection, right?
This column means that he's at a labor camp.<eos> What do the other columns mean?<eos> Look, I don't know, I just asked about Bram because...<eos> I'm sorry to interrupt, but Mr. Burgess is about to give his toast.<eos> - He wants you there.
I'm sure it's much needed hereabouts.<eos> Yes! It is my mission to bring fallen women to God.<eos> We all have our cross to bear.<eos> Should you be venturing downstairs, ma'am?<eos> Let me help you back to your room.
I'm considered unfit to resume my duties.<eos> For your sake, I'm sorry.<eos> Don't be.<eos> I dare say I can bear to convalesce here a while longer.<eos> May I escort you to church, Miss Penvenen?
You mind if we pop over to your house and take a look at that brand-new computer of yours?<eos> I had pictures on that laptop... of my boyfriend and me.<eos> Pictures he promised to give back.<eos> "He"?<eos> He the person that was blackmailing you?
It takes weeks, sometimes months, to acclimate to these open spaces.<eos> You saw what happened when we stepped off the ship.<eos> You're breathing natural air. You're trying to orient yourself with that damned horizon.<eos> Just rest.<eos> A transport is coming to get you.
Well, I'm surprised.<eos> Usually, when Criminal Intelligence takes possession of evidence...<eos> No one ever sees it again, that's right.<eos> But...<eos> Winnie Davis is watching you
- You look very beautiful.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> How is traffic out there?<eos> Traffic's not a problem. You sit back, relax.<eos> Let Firuz take good care of you.
Mr. Beaumont!<eos> My name is Maxine Carlson.<eos> I was short-listed for a job with your company until Oliver Yates rejected me.<eos> That's what you're doing here?<eos> If Oliver rejected you, that's the end of it.
When I worked at my first startup, I would transfer people to "my supervisor," and then I'd just get back on the phone myself.<eos> Oh.<eos> Uh, yeah, hello.<eos> No, no, I'm not gonna go on hold again.<eos> Um, in fact, could I transfer you to my supervisor?
I'm very sorry for your loss.<eos> But I want to honor your wife, if you'll allow me.<eos> Yeah.<eos> No.<eos> No! Ms. Scott, we need to get you upstairs.
Um, okay, then.<eos> I'll let you get back to work.<eos> All right.<eos> I'm sorry. Can I help you?<eos> - I was told to ask for you.
Does this hurt, Dr. Rowan?<eos> Okay, all right, all right.<eos> Who are you?<eos> I'm Dr. Halstead.<eos> I'm gonna help Dr. Manning here take care of you.
Yes. He checked.<eos> Good.<eos> Mrs. Waterford,<eos> I know I failed you.<eos> I... I disappointed you and myself.
I'm not some personal injury lawyer, all right?<eos> I work at Pearson specter litt.<eos> I'm not gonna get worn down.<eos> So I suggest you just cut me a check.<eos> Save yourself the trouble of me wiping the floor with you in court.
But it was all in good fun.<eos> I suppose in retrospect it was impolite of me to kill her husband and set her up for the crime.<eos> But William, the look on her face when the verdict came in...<eos> Guilty.<eos> Dr. Ogden, the nature of this crime is such that I have no recourse but to sentence you to be hanged by the neck until you are dead.
Mexican chocolates, from my home town.<eos> Thank you, for helping me understand your world a bit.<eos> Under His eye.<eos> But you don't understand.<eos> I lied to you.
- I'm sorry about that, Silas.<eos> - It's all right.<eos> You got yourself a boyfriend?<eos> I'm not short of offers.<eos> One of them could put you up for a couple of days until we're finished.
I look for people that are passionate about what they do, and for some reason, they haven't found success.<eos> And I know money.<eos> I know how to make it work.<eos> I know how to get it.<eos> I have it... and I'm willing to invest it in you.
- Wait outside the doors.<eos> - But, ma'am, I can't...<eos> It's fine.<eos> I come in peace, right?<eos> I'll be right out here if you need me.
Yes, but it's different this time. There's so much going on--<eos> -I know, but call me superstitious. -We're in here. But we have done this every election we have ever won.<eos> -Come on.<eos> -I wonder if I know what you mean.<eos> I wonder if you wonder.
I... I talked to my father almost every day.<eos> How... how come I never even heard of you? I don't know.<eos> I have a family.<eos> Maybe he was trying to protect me.<eos> So you expect me to believe that my father... loved you so much that he...
Eugenia, in a perfect world, a woman as smart as you would not need someone like me to help you with your money, but it's not a perfect world.<eos> So here's what I offer my clients. I offer two things.<eos> Number one: I offer a safe but aggressive investment scheme that follows the... the way that economics are trending, right?<eos> 'Cause I read the... There's this... uh, report.<eos> I'm sure you don't read it 'cause it would bore you to death. But I do. I read them.
Why not?<eos> I've got nothing else to live for.<eos> And we know you're good at waiting in cars.<eos> Vicky Ernst...<eos> It says here that our victim, Cheryl, outed you for abusing company sick-leave policy.
And we know you're good at waiting in cars.<eos> Vicky Ernst...<eos> It says here that our victim, Cheryl, outed you for abusing company sick-leave policy.<eos> Sometimes, my boss makes personal calls on our office phone to England.<eos> It also says here that Cheryl's tattling cost you a big promotion.
It's okay.<eos> You can tell me. When the alarm went off, I was in the bathroom.<eos> Alone. I came out and I saw Jim running for the stairs.<eos> - He yelled for me to follow.<eos> - So, Jim could vouch for you?
Welcome back, Ms. Devereaux.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Um? - Ellis.<eos> - Ellis.<eos> Allow me to escort you to your safety deposit unit.
Thank you, major.<eos> And may I have the honor to present Miss Philomena Cheer.<eos> Renowned actress of the New York stage.<eos> Miss Cheer, the famed actress.<eos> Truly your reputation precedes you.
But if a split ticket were to happen... it would be bad for this country.<eos> No, Conway is what would be bad for this country.<eos> Let's hope the House does the right thing.<eos> But as far as the Senate, I am very grateful that we have Donald Blythe steering that ship.<eos> Mrs. Underwood, I'm sorry to say this, but no matter what you're offering here, I can't support the president. And, by extension, I can't support you.
It's Claire Underwood who has the promising future.<eos> I want a woman in the White House.<eos> And if she has to start as a vice president, fine.<eos> But it's time.<eos> It's time. I hear that, Louise, but I'll say it... a vote for you is a vote for Frank Underwood.
Just a little tracker, you know... it would be terrible if me and you were to lose each other.<eos> It's like Fort Knox in here.<eos> But it's far more secure.<eos> Mrs. Clios...<eos> I will check you in, if the computer permits it.
What about Obergrupperfuhrer Schmidt? Hm?<eos> What are your intentions with him?<eos> How do you live with yourself?<eos> Fraulein Adler?<eos> Polizeifuhrer Goetschl is asking for you.
We're working for Lormong Vang.<eos> Su Lin, a man named Sawm Cheng has taken your daughter.<eos> I think he's planning to do to her what Lormong Vang did to you.<eos> I understand why you left.<eos> You couldn't live your life with a man who forced you to marry him, but I know there's not a moment where you're not thinking about Michelle.
- Pleased to meet you.<eos> - Ma'am.<eos> Please continue.<eos> Respectfully, sir, this information is only for you and your security team.<eos> - Agent Wells, I promise you...
It's my job to know what's going on.<eos> Perhaps, but not from me.<eos> He'll know what this is about.<eos> He can tell you if he wants, but I'm not gonna betray his confidence.<eos> I'll try and schedule you in.
I need to lead this country back from this terrible tragedy.<eos> Are you still up for this?<eos> Mr. President, I haven't even gotten started yet.<eos> Good.<eos> This is a Presidential Finding absolving you from all FBI supervision.
- He'll be at your disposal.<eos> You'll be provided with a secure office with secure communications.<eos> Nobody will know what you're doing. Understood?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Agent Wells, I hereby authorize you to use whatever means necessary, within the Constitution of the United States of America, to find the people involved in this conspiracy and bring them to justice.
We'll find her, and we'll make her pay.<eos> It's not gonna bring my son back.<eos> Claudine Poyet.<eos> That's her.<eos> I hereby authorize you to use whatever means necessary to find the people involved in this conspiracy and bring them to justice.
Chuck, it's me.<eos> The place is completely cleared out.<eos> I need you to look into the building records. Find out who owns the property and any transaction history.<eos> Hit me back when you've got something.<eos> If it makes you feel any better, this is actually totally standard political procedure.
Wife, mother, spokesman, role model.<eos> How do you keep it all together?<eos> I have to admit, it has been, uh... an adjustment with a steep learning curve.<eos> I mean, just yesterday, I managed to get in hot water for a comment I made at a luncheon.<eos> Senator Jack Bowman of Montana accused you of soft-pedaling gun control on behalf of the President.
- And it's working.<eos> There's already talk of a Bowman White House run.<eos> And he's trying to eliminate his competition, ma'am.<eos> I mean, introducing this bill without consulting you?<eos> He's trying to take you out at the knees.
Commander, may I see your credentia one more time?<eos> When was the last time you had this scanner cleaned?<eos> Hmm?<eos> In Cairo, we clean our scanners daily.<eos> - Commander, let me escort you.
Okay, thank you.<eos> This one's a keeper.<eos> You need to get him more involved.<eos> Excuse me, ma'am.<eos> Someone is asking for you.
Now you're gonna tell me, you don't wanna fight for that?<eos> What are you looking at? All right, let's get these guys in here, come on.<eos> Let's get 'em out of here! Come on, let's go!<eos> Chief Giles, what's going on?<eos> Do I know you, miss?
Your water broke, and you're in pre-term labor.<eos> She's in labor already?<eos> Isn't it too early? Well, she's 31 weeks, which isn't completely to term, but it's... it's far enough along for survival.<eos> I don't even have a crib yet.<eos> Kristen's allowed to have you in the room with her... for the labor.
Isn't it too early? Well, she's 31 weeks, which isn't completely to term, but it's... it's far enough along for survival.<eos> I don't even have a crib yet.<eos> Kristen's allowed to have you in the room with her... for the labor.<eos> Did you tell her that I'm here? No.<eos> But she's been asking for you.
You want to talk to him?<eos> I have him right here.<eos> 4:00 P.M., Ms. Vaughan...<eos> The money and your brother.<eos> Or I'll come to you.
You were very level-headed.<eos> My, my, you're the last folks I was looking for today, but I'm real glad to see you.<eos> And how are you doing, dear Anne?<eos> I'm well enough, thank you.<eos> What brings you by, Miss Cuthbert?
Ma'am, you can't be back there.<eos> Uh, snakes...<eos> You might need to call security. This... Uh...<eos> There's no snakes here. There's no... There's no snakes...<eos> Okay, we're gonna get you over to someone.
La Frenais.<eos> La Frenais.<eos> Is it part of your method that you can lie to the suspect?<eos> Sorry, Counselor. You... can you speak up?<eos> I think that Lisa is having problems hearing you.
He's cooperating.<eos> And we never agreed to anything other than his bail.<eos> I'll... let's deal with this later.<eos> Okay? Okay.<eos> Do I know you? No.
I got to take your badge.<eos> It's important that you make it clear that the suspect was reaching for his gun, and that fearing for your safety and the safety of those around you, you defended yourself and shot him.<eos> I mean, do it in your own words, but keep it boilerplate.<eos> Detective Sullivan, Lieutenant Cynthia Barrow, Internal Affairs.<eos> Lot of people calling you a hero.
We're thrilled to be here.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> This is my husband Henry McCord.<eos> Nelly Conlon.<eos> Such a pleasure to meet you.
You're so not in an open relationship that your husband hired a private investigator to find out what you were up to.<eos> Remember that Civic you saw following you on a date with Jamie?<eos> That was him.<eos> And it gets worse.<eos> Turns out your husband's P.I. was following you the night of the murder.
That was him.<eos> And it gets worse.<eos> Turns out your husband's P.I. was following you the night of the murder.<eos> That's who called your husband and told him where you were.<eos> That's how Will found you.
And if she is dead or in prison, she is no help to him.<eos> Do you see my problem?<eos> We wouldn't need much from you.<eos> What means "not much"?<eos> Well, an occasional question about how TASS works, maybe the name of an employee or two, who watches over you, if you know what I mean.
That product was - bought and paid for.<eos> Aaah... You are not gonna weasel me this time.<eos> - I want my 35 grand.<eos> - Oh, just hold on.<eos> Would I come here, to your church, if I scammed you?
We believe that a woman's education is just as important as a man's.<eos> That is admirable.<eos> Now that your... ward, your...<eos> Anne.<eos> Since your Anne is part of our community now and you'll be raising her, we wanted to extend the invitation for you to join us.
So... it's all right.<eos> I miss my dear Gertrude very much. And I loved her with all my heart.<eos> She was your kindred spirit.<eos> Yes.<eos> I admire you, Miss Josephine.
- You were sacked?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Then, why did you put you resigned?<eos> Cos I was ashamed of being sacked.<eos> Why were you sacked?
I see.<eos> That's, erm... as bad as resigning, yeah?<eos> People might think it worse, Mrs Fitzsimmons, but the penalty might well be the same.<eos> 13 weeks.<eos> But we'll notify you of that by letter.
To really protect people... you need power.<eos> This place is the first step in getting it.<eos> It's not too late to do the right thing.<eos> Ma'am...<eos> Colonel Nix is ready for you.
Miss, I need you to step out of the car, please.<eos> She won't get out the car, Chief.<eos> What's your name?<eos> Where am I?<eos> You're at the Quai des Orfevres and what we need to do is we need to take you inside and ask you some questions.
That's my loft.<eos> Mrs. Hendrix? I'm Doctor Slaight.<eos> - What do you want?<eos> - I spoke with your surgeon.<eos> He said he discussed a C-section with you?
Okay, Derek, just calm down, okay?<eos> Maybe Ms. Crane has something she'd like to say.<eos> Wha...?<eos> No.<eos> Nothing about whether or not your father, Roland Crane, plans to go after the cop that roughed you up during a routine traffic stop?
Okay. I'm not far.<eos> There's police already there.<eos> We'll try to send more, but I'm not...<eos> Hello?<eos> Do I know you?
Ma'am, you done did a terrible thing to me.<eos> You made me glad I ain't in Texas.<eos> Who is it?<eos> FBI, open the door.<eos> Every time I look at you, I say to myself...
We're investigating her death.<eos> Are you saying Mike is a suspect?<eos> He would never be capable of murder.<eos> You sure about that?<eos> He was capable of duping you for nine months.
I saw a Mercedes parked in your garage when we came in.<eos> She must've come home.<eos> You didn't notice?<eos> We're worried that someone might try to hurt<eos> Caitlin or you, Mrs. Kinzie.
Watch out, Jones.<eos> I'll bring you takeout.<eos> Entering Heather's room now.<eos> Knock, knock.<eos> I'm here to take you to your MRI.
Where are you taking me?<eos> I'm taking you someplace safe.<eos> Tell me what the hell is going on here.<eos> Heather, I'm a Federal agent.<eos> We have credible Intel that there's a hit out on you.
-You know what?<eos> I just can't keep doing this.<eos> Stop calling me, please.<eos> The interview will not be happening.<eos> Someone will escort you back to your hotel.
We've all been responding in real time to a potential terrorist attack.<eos> But you chose to stay here.<eos> Why weren't you in the bunker with us?<eos> I chose to remain in my office to oversee the capture or killing of one Ahmed Al Ahmadi.<eos> Mmm. And yet there was great tension this morning between you and General Braegher.
Nobody's happy with that.<eos> We were hoping to bring you live coverage of the judiciary hearing today. But given the postponement due to Secretary Durant's unexpected absence, we'll be switching to the Armed Services Committee meeting instead,<eos> - where several military officials are citing the increased threat of ICO--<eos> Today's schedule.<eos> And I thought you might wanna see this.
I mean, the damage your testimony could do to your wife is not worth the risk.<eos> Oh, its worth is what we're here to discuss.<eos> I don't appreciate being the one to tell you this, but... your presidency is beyond repair.<eos> You don't know what I'm going to do next. Isn't that it?<eos> Isn't that what really bothers you?
Maybe I love power more.<eos> For you, and for any dear to you, I would do anything.<eos> If my career were of that better kind that there was any opportunity or capacity to sacrifice in it, I would embrace any sacrifice for you and for those dear to you.<eos> Try to hold me in your mind, at some quiet times, as ardent and sincere in this one thing.<eos> The time will come, the time will not be long in coming, when new ties will be formed about you. The ties that will bind you yet more tenderly and strongly to the home you so adorn.
Where did he find the strength to kill and bury three grown men?<eos> Revenge is a mighty fuel.<eos> Doctor Ogden, Detective.<eos> Miss Roy and I have done some calculations based on the rate of decomposition of the two corpses we found buried in clay.<eos> - Our baseline was the body you buried...
What a good excuse to buy a nice pair of new ones.<eos> That's why I love you.<eos> Always remember that.<eos> Thank you so much, Mrs. Pasternak.<eos> I'm sure you're wondering why I want these ashes.
And the buck stops with me, so it seems.<eos> Look, between you and me?<eos> Wasn't your fault.<eos> You're getting a raw deal.<eos> Still, I think Homeland Security is waiting to reassign you.
Are you arresting me?<eos> No, not yet.<eos> Then I'm leaving.<eos> You should know, Dr. Wilkerson, we are seeking a warrant for your financial records as we speak.<eos> If there's a money trail between you and Eli Kotite, we will find it.
Someone important.<eos> Sorry we're late.<eos> The first Verdammt taxi that came couldn't accommodate the car seat.<eos> Sherlock Holmes.<eos> Kitty's been expecting you.
Max Hyland turned himself in to the police today.<eos> He confessed to killing your husband.<eos> Dylan is the only person left at Hyland skydiving.<eos> She's lost her father, now her uncle.<eos> So I'm asking you, please don't take away the only thing she has left that reminds her of her father.
And I was painting Danny's room...<eos> I fell off the ladder and broke my arm.<eos> Danny was there, but I didn't see him come in.<eos> Then when I asked him to help me, He just stood there, laughing.<eos> Is it possible that Danny may have pushed you off that ladder?
Stop acting like one. It's not always about you. You're just...<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Are you alright?<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> - Did we get it on you? - No, no, no.
I just don't want - to let her get away.<eos> - Go! Go! I'll get these.<eos> Oh, thank you. Thanks so much.<eos> Hey! Listen.<eos> Your daughter is struggling on the threshold of what it means to become you.
We need to prove that her actions were reasonable.<eos> Like Bull predicted, he's making her look uninformed, like she doesn't do her homework.<eos> HFOA was a fraud?<eos> - Are you sure?<eos> - So I guess it's... fool you twice, isn't it, Ms. Howland?
My hope is, all who answer it will see that they are not alone.<eos> I must be there to meet them.<eos> Her involvement has been a secret, but the Empire will be attempting to track any ship that tries to leave this system.<eos> I know a way to sneak you out of the sector.<eos> Senator, we'll get you to that meeting.
The, uh, the guy that made the scene, has he been in here before?<eos> Uh, no. I-I don't think so.<eos> All right.<eos> We have to speak to a few more administrators, but if you think of anything, please don't hesitate to call. Okay?<eos> Hey, I remember you.
Hope those green eyes are worth it.<eos> - Please.<eos> I wanted to tell you this in person.<eos> Teo will not be working with you from here on out.<eos> He was setting you up.
Is this a bad time?<eos> No, no, no. Not at all.<eos> I'm calling about my free consultation.<eos> Sure.<eos> What do you have in my mind...
We're here to talk.<eos> But you need to put your weapon down now.<eos> No, you're... you're lying.<eos> You're here to kill me and get rid of the evidence.<eos> We're here to... We are here to save you from those people.
I'm pleased to inform you the board has selected you for the fellowship.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> No thanks necessary. Except, perhaps to agent Mojtabai.<eos> He was the one who recommended you.
Max, why don't you ask Rebecca about the last weddings that she's done?<eos> The upstairs gallery is lined with personal photographs from previous events that I've done,<eos> - so let me show you, Maxine.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Ms. Sherman, um, in the interest of both your time and the First Family's safety, I'd like to address some logistics before you start, if you don't mind.
You must be Agent Gale.<eos> Charmed, I'm sure.<eos> Speaking of charm, I hear Reddington can be very charming.<eos> What was it like going on the run with him?<eos> Did he charm you?
Never have.<eos> Well, apparently, it's a designation that the Bureau reserves for certain high profile cases.<eos> It's classified, so I can't look at the files or interview the great American heroes of law enforcement that are doing such important work.<eos> However, I was able to pinpoint the first time that, uh, the designation was used.<eos> Do you care for another date?
Ma'am! Can you hear me?<eos> We gotta get you out of here!<eos> - Come on. We got you.<eos> - No.<eos> - We got you, come on.
- Yeah, Kelly.<eos> Severide.<eos> How's it going?<eos> I got it covered.<eos> Okay, well, your daughter stopped in the firehouse yesterday, and she seemed pretty worried about you.
What, business?<eos> Romantic?<eos> You're lovers, aren't you?<eos> Well, on and off.<eos> So through you, he did get access to Clay Nelson and Oliver Pittman.
I told you I was good.<eos> Look...<eos> I know this is really, really tough. But everything Paul tells me about you tells me that you will handle this with strength and dignity.<eos> Dr. Cummings?<eos> They're asking for you in Trauma 1.
We're a private corporation.<eos> That's privileged.<eos> Okay, then how about you give me the names of the guards who saw it?<eos> You know I can't give you that either.<eos> And you know that if I bring a suit against you, I'm gonna get all of this anyway.
All right.<eos> What about my husband?<eos> I've been here for hours, and no one has told me anything.<eos> I'm sorry, it's too late.<eos> We have to take you to county now.
She never had a problem with drugs before.<eos> So Elizabeth, when she saw those scars on Cora's arms, she tore into her.<eos> She called her a whore. A degenerate.<eos> She refused to take Cora in.<eos> Cora was lucky to have you.
Both Literally and Figuratively:<eos> The Study of the Paranormal?<eos> I think you're looking for a different Erin Gilbert.<eos> One that likes very long titles.<eos> Okay. But this really does look like you.
I have no wound.<eos> Lovely bid, Mr. Kingston!<eos> More Sherry for Mr. Kingston please!<eos> Mrs. featherstone.<eos> I'm afraid Mr. Darcy's here to see you, ma'am.
Well, I'm actually just passing through on my way to new English, officer, or is it trooper?<eos> It's sheriff.<eos> This is not a town you "pass through".<eos> It's barely a town that you live in.<eos> What brings you to this part of the world?
Frigid, right?<eos> Well, fuck 'em!<eos> Town this small, this old, you can measure its age in secrets.<eos> Like the rings on a redwood.<eos> What brings you to me?
I was ten yards back when I heard the first shot.<eos> And as my eyes crossed the President's car...<eos> Mrs. Kennedy...<eos> Keep going.<eos> I had to get to you, put myself between you, the President, and the shooter.
You people aren't doing anything.<eos> Do I have to go and find her myself?<eos> That might show me you care, which I'm not sure I believe.<eos> You can't talk to me like that.<eos> - I'll get you fired.
- I'll get you fired.<eos> - Oh, go for it.<eos> You wouldn't be the first shitty mom to try.<eos> I deal with parents every day who should have never brought a life into this world, but most of them are poor or addicts, which I don't forgive them for, but I can understand why it might be hard for them<eos> You... I'm finding it hard to make excuses for.
Are you proposing we run?<eos> Until when?<eos> Until you come up with a better idea?<eos> I'll testify.<eos> They could arrest you.
You know, then?<eos> I know if Abe were alive.<eos> You would have told me you were coming.<eos> Shall we take our tea outside?<eos> Before he died he told me to find you.
Keep up the good work.<eos> I'll try, sir.<eos> Great.<eos> What can I do for you?<eos> I was hoping I could just have a word with you for a second.
I think that's fantastic news, oh my god.<eos> Thank you so much. Good, well we're all very excited about it over here.<eos> In fact, I have a fan who'd very much like to meet you.<eos> Hello Ms. Scott.<eos> It is such a pleasure to meet you.
I can schedule you as soon as the new year.<eos> See, but I'm going on tour with Quinn after the new year.<eos> I'll make some time.<eos> Well, enjoy your holiday and after the new year,<eos> I'll... I'll take care of you.
Wake up, mommy!<eos> Dr. banks...<eos> A pleasure.<eos> General shang, the pleasure is mine, really.<eos> Your president said he was honored to host me at the celebration... Yeah. ...but I confess, the only reason why I'm here is to meet you in person.
And there is always food in the fridge.<eos> You and Will can work out your level of interaction yourselves.<eos> Um, obviously...<eos> Well, I would hope that you could get on.<eos> It would be nice if he could think of you as a friend rather than a paid professional.
G'day.<eos> I'm Nathan.<eos> Right.<eos> Well, I'll leave you to get on.<eos> Miss Clark, Nathan will talk you through Will's routines and equipment.
Life isn't all bad then, eh?<eos> Will.I.Am.<eos> Anyway, anyway, must mingle.<eos> It's good to see you, Will.<eos> And you, Miss Clark.
Diagnosed with a delusional disorder, Jack was prescribed daily sessions of electroshock therapy at twice the recommended dosage.<eos> On March 13th 1974, Karen and Jack would cross paths for the first time, setting in motion one of the most destructive love affairs in the annals of US crime.<eos> Get your fuckin' paws off me, man!<eos> My people was born here in this dirt and I'll do as I goddamn please!<eos> Can I help you?
I...<eos> Oh, come on!<eos> - Come along. - Hurry up.<eos> Frau Quangel?<eos> I'll take you home.
In this case, you need a doctor from a factory to certify that you are unable to work, a doctor that we assign to you.<eos> All right, sign me a doctor and you'll see what happens.<eos> You're mocking me and the Women's League?<eos> Making fun of our regulations and our Führer? - I warn you.<eos> - And I warn you.
People seem to open up to you.<eos> You must have a skill for asking the right questions.<eos> Usually people want to tell somebody, and I'm just there at the right time.<eos> Come on. You're being modest.<eos> What brings you to the party?
You've heard this before.<eos> There're several great spport groups in here, and a few therapists who specialize in domestic violence.<eos> I want you to reach out, get some help for your situation.<eos> And I never want to see you again.<eos> - Hi, can I help you?
Good morning.<eos> I'll leave you to it.<eos> Sir Alistair Canning.<eos> I am the British Government representative in southern Africa.<eos> And yet I find myself in London today. Because it is my duty to inform you that Mr Seretse Khama has been gravely mistaken in believing he may take you as his wife.
I am going on a longboat.<eos> I will go on a longboat.<eos> He went to London.<eos> He is going to London.<eos> She thought you were Miss Jess.
- We're twins. - I am... sorry.<eos> - It's okay.<eos> Um, but why were you scared?<eos> She knows your sister went into Aokigahara.<eos> She thought you were a yurei.
It should only be for a few days.<eos> You know how we feel about you here at Pembroke, Susan.<eos> Well, thank you.<eos> - It's so nice to see you.<eos> - It's good to see you, too...
Let me know how that goes.<eos> I've still got your number.<eos> Bye, Reacher.<eos> Major.<eos> Good to see you back, Major.
I did it.<eos> I did it.<eos> Mrs. Lassiter, these vile things that your husband said to you, did that happen often?<eos> I'm sorry. What?<eos> Did he verbally abuse you frequently?
You're not here to sleep with or perform jobs of any type on my Marines.<eos> Clear copy, Miss Baker?<eos> - Copy that.<eos> - Good.<eos> We'll get you out to a FOB as soon as we find a ride for you.
No, sir, you do not.<eos> I returned to this country to save it.<eos> I am a friend of America.<eos> Which is why you should let me interview you, so people can understand that.<eos> I like you, Kim.
Well, I'm very sorry for what happened to you.<eos> So if there's anything that you want to say to me, that's why I'm here.<eos> That's why I came here.<eos> Ma'am,<eos> I lost my legs because of an IED, not because of you.
No!<eos> No!<eos> He's down! He's down! Shit, we need a medical for the girl now!<eos> Mrs. Kolbein, do not leave that room.<eos> The second suspect is coming for you!
No shot! No shot!<eos> He has the kid!<eos> Agh!<eos> Mrs. Kolbein, do not leave that room!<eos> The second suspect is coming for you!
Well... I'd better get this back to the nick.<eos> I'll be seeing you.<eos> The item is... ..a gentleman's wallet!<eos> And now for my next trick, I require the assistance of a beautiful women and a very brave gentleman.<eos> Yes! Madame. You!
"You're my heart, Charlie Greel, but every time I look at you..."<eos> What?<eos> I saw Conrad.<eos> And that was too much to bear.<eos> He took advantage of you?
Surrounding our village was a big forest.<eos> And deep within this forest... there was an abandoned temple.<eos> It is said that the line between the world of the dead and the living... is very thin at this place.<eos> You should go there.<eos> Take the ashes of your son... spread them on the steps of this temple... lock yourself inside... and when night comes... he will come to you.
- I have more questions.<eos> - I'm sorry, this interview is over.<eos> No, no, no!<eos> I can't believe Richard let this happened.<eos> Did Richard put you up to this? - No.
- You know... - Sorry, they're paging me.<eos> Sometimes I look at Vincent, the big lout with nothing special about him that came out of my belly, and I have to admit I don't know him.<eos> - Evening, Michèle.<eos> - Evening, Rebecca.<eos> Patrick will walk you inside.
Shit. Get me out of here, please!<eos> Open the door.<eos> Please get me out of here. I'm not...<eos> Just take it easy.<eos> We're gonna take care of you. - I'm not sick.
We don't always see eye to eye.<eos> We never see eye to eye, in fact.<eos> You don't have to agree with your parents.<eos> Mine say that I'm crazy.<eos> So they locked you up here?
And I'm doing everything I can to stop it.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Porn is bad.<eos> Something I don't understand. Your daughter, she did a film with Sid Shattuck.<eos> Now, why would she do that when she knows that's just gonna be extremely professionally embarrassing for you?
You really think you've got something done here.<eos> Do you have a clue what just happened?<eos> It was protocol. I followed protocol.<eos> What's wrong with him?<eos> I believe he's making a connection between you and Adolf Hitler.
This means she's not that disabled, after all.<eos> Here's a form for your claim and a questionnaire, please fill those out.<eos> Do you have a health record?<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> Then we'll first register you as Yegor's nanny hired upon recommendation from our facility, and in six months, you can apply for custody over Yegor.
Chao cac co! Mrs. Nguyen, it's a beautiful day out there.<eos> You should get out of this place once in a while.<eos> You know, throw a frisbee, have some fun.<eos> I have a business to run.<eos> Uh, no. The business is running you.
Good afternoon. I am Sherlock Holmes, this is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson.<eos> You may speak freely in front of him, as he rarely understands a word.<eos> Holmes! However, before you do, allow me to make some trifling observations.<eos> You have an impish sense of humour, which currently you are deploying to ease a degree of personal anguish.<eos> You have recently married a man of a seemingly kindly disposition, who has now abandoned you for an unsavoury companion of dubious morals.
Luck?<eos> ! Those are my specialisms.<eos> Hmm, this is really very promising.<eos> Holmes...<eos> Please... do tell us what has so distressed you.
I don't know where to place you.<eos> Exactly what do you do?<eos> Community manager, website design...<eos> The Internet?<eos> I'll put you under OTHERS.
The author penned this letter with their non-dominant hand.<eos> Perhaps it was a feeble attempt to conceal authorship.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Mr. Navarra will compare the letter to the writing samples we're collecting from your husband's home.<eos> You'll be the first to know when we have something.
Dimensionality... perhaps.<eos> Nonetheless, you have a vision that transcends mere skill.<eos> As if you see directly into an object's essence.<eos> For example, the fact that this peach contains a lot of water.<eos> I hesitate to stand before you, for fear that you might read my thoughts.
Think it was easy for a Korean farmhand's son to reach here?<eos> Fifteen hard years in Japan before hearing about you.<eos> Another three years to prepare.<eos> I studied bookmaking and learned to paint forgeries.<eos> All so that I could meet you. To seduce and marry you, to possess your father's inheritance, and then probably to get rid of you.

A woman might wager her fate on such an exquisite pair.<eos> I'm sure that Sookee will try her very best in order to see herself wearing these in the mirror.<eos> I'll tell you how to keep her from getting suspicious.<eos> Keep her busy until the day of the wedding.<eos> Make her spend all her energy on making you fall in love with me.
I'm glad.<eos> Marry me once again.<eos> This time as Íam Sookee.<eos> You want another wedding night?<eos> I think I like you... slightly.
I saw you out on the sands.<eos> It's frank.<eos> I know he's a silly boy, but he'll make a fine man one day.<eos> I love him, miss winters.<eos> Trouble is, he loves you.
We need to rule out emphysema.<eos> It was emphysema what did for my husband.<eos> I'm a widow. I need to work.<eos> You have a strapping grown-up son, Mrs Bulmer.<eos> He could take care of you now.
I, I'm only a couple of hours late.<eos> 'Her order's always on time.'<eos> Yeah, I, I know Mrs Buckle is never late with her order but I'm not Mrs Buckle.<eos> - 'Sorry. There's nothing I can do.'<eos> - Look, I'm begging you for a favour!
I seem to remember WE helped shell peas number two, three and four.<eos> I hope we haven't done anything to offend.<eos> I'm going to the clinic at St Cuthbert's.<eos> They want me to have it in hospital, on account of my age.<eos> Well, they're obviously taking very good care of you, because you look extremely well.
Here.<eos> It's all right, Lizzie.<eos> You're safe here.<eos> - I should go.<eos> - I can walk you to the police station, after Nurse Gilbert's tidied you up.
Where am I?<eos> You're safe, ma'am.<eos> You're under our protection now.<eos> That's a relief.<eos> Have you been harmed in any way?
He'll give you refuge, I'm sure.<eos> Ah!<eos> Lieutenant Barnes, really.<eos> I'm shocked that a king's officer would behave in such an unchristian manner.<eos> Ma'am, I thought he meant to do you harm.
What gives you the right to listen to us, but not share anything about yourself?<eos> That's not my role.<eos> - Trust has to be earned.<eos> - True.<eos> Maybe if you tell us what you're fighting... we'll be a little more open to do the same.
I'd wear your narrow ass out.<eos> What's this about?<eos> Your cousin.<eos> I'm shutting him down.<eos> You, too.
He has several?<eos> So I assume you have his code for his private entrance.<eos> What private entrance?<eos> Don't say another word, Ms. Miller.<eos> I'm representing you now.
Why won't you help me find him?<eos> - I want a lawyer.<eos> - Why?<eos> You're not under arrest.<eos> But I can do that. I can arrest you.
I left to become a psychologist.<eos> I'm with the peer assistance program. I'm a volunteer.<eos> Well, how about I volunteer my way out of this chair, tell you to kiss my ass, and talk to my union rep?<eos> Well, you could do that, sure.<eos> But your inspector would guarantee that you'll be at your desk, and the only time you'll see the street is in the parking lot, or if you go to get coffee, or...
Do you love? Do you love?<eos> Oh, come on. You're not gonna beg?<eos> Oh, come on. Not even a little bit?<eos> If you gonna kill me, then just do it.<eos> What shook you?
If you gonna kill me, then just do it.<eos> What shook you?<eos> Was it losing your gun to one suspect while trying to arrest another without backup?<eos> Was it the extra eyes because of Scarfe? Was it this Luke Cage guy?<eos> What pushed you towards career suicide?
That's what made me such a good point guard.<eos> 'Cause I could see everything in my head.<eos> I knew exactly where people were gonna be, so I put the ball right where it needed to go.<eos> But you couldn't see Scarfe for what he was.<eos> Or were you blinded by your emotions?
Own your shit.<eos> You went renegade when you went after Luke Cage alone.<eos> And it got... way deeper than it should have.<eos> And this guy took the control away from you when he took your gun.<eos> Then you're in a room alone with Miss Temple, and she insults you, and you lost control... and you know it.
- I taught you well.<eos> Go home, Alex.<eos> I'm letting you off early.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What happened out there... that bothers you the most?
He goes by... lawyer.<eos> You need me to spell it?<eos> - You call this safe?<eos> - We're hiding in plain sight.<eos> I've got you. For now.
To be honest I never really liked the writing.<eos> It was just a job. Like selling shoes or whatever.<eos> Something one has to do.<eos> You must've sold a Iot of shoes. What do you mean?<eos> I mean, since you can afford all this.
My fiancé was dancing as well.<eos> _ Really?<eos> _ Mhm. What happened?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Between you and your fiancé?
Thanks for a lovely evening.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Good night.<eos> My God!<eos> _ Did I scare you?
Hi, welcome to the Aria.<eos> - Heather Lee, checking in.<eos> - Okay.<eos> NORTH ELEVATORS - 10 MINS<eos> We have you in a lovely sky suite, number 2016.
I didn't.<eos> I just assumed.<eos> Did Chloe say who she was selling for?<eos> - No, she didn't say.<eos> - Look. You were seen down the wharf at 3:15 in the morning, walking your dog.
...So we can know what's going on<eos> Till the police get there, okay? Just a moment.<eos> Does he have any weapons?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Has he hit you today or no?
It was a wild night and very windy.<eos> Is this seat free?<eos> Yes.<eos> That was a big branch.<eos> Did it frighten you?
Please forget that.<eos> I'm really not a bad mother.<eos> Oh, I have cold SpaghettiOs twice a week.<eos> Twice a week at least. I keep a case at the rectory.<eos> Actually, I invited you here because I wanted to discuss the girls and home.
Sweet mother. Is that Penguin?<eos> Duck. - He seems drugged.<eos> - He's been quite agitated since he arrived.<eos> We put him on a mild sedative to keep him from hurting himself.<eos> Dr. Thompkins, my assistant, Ms. Peabody, will accompany you to the infirmary.
No!<eos> Well, okay, but my train is in 45 minutes.<eos> I don't have to say good-bye to Ray.<eos> I don't want to stress him out.<eos> No, he specifically asked us to get you.
You had no subsequent contact with her?<eos> You've already asked me that, Ma'am.<eos> No, there was no subsequent contact.<eos> Look, Catherine. You used to work in HMIT, you know the procedure.<eos> You left threatening messages on her answering machine, and you found the body, so we have to eliminate you, that's all.
Sure. - Nice to meet you.<eos> Here's a fountain pen. I hope you like it.<eos> - This is my friend, Anna.<eos> She's also an actress.<eos> - Have I seen you in anything?
If I'd been brave enough, I would have done it myself.<eos> But Freddie has a temper, as you can see.<eos> And he may come back.<eos> Well, don't worry.<eos> We'll take care of you.
Mr. Thorn suggested that you might've known him.<eos> Yes. He worked with me at Armitage.<eos> Hmm. Ms. Rutledge, are you Mr. Thorn's attorney?<eos> Yes.<eos> He says you're not. He says he only met you a week ago, and he suggested that you might be stalking him.
Why don't they shut up!<eos> - Just stop it!<eos> - Stop it! Shut up!<eos> Please.<eos> Please! We're begging you!
That's exactly what I was going to say.<eos> Look at us, on the same page already.<eos> Well, a man who notices a woman's eyes... You must be a real romantic.<eos> We're a dying breed.<eos> How about I take you to dinner?
Were you lovers?<eos> Did you choose the CityDart flight?<eos> It was the best flight.<eos> For what? For our schedule.<eos> Did you become lovers before or after he hired you as his researcher?
Since 2001, ma'am.<eos> Whose children are those?<eos> They're mine.<eos> You have a driver's license?<eos> There's a line behind you, ma'am.
_ _<eos> You will forgive the rudeness of these children, Captain.<eos> The French language is not easily mastered by the English.<eos> I took no offense, sire.<eos> Oh, but perhaps the king himself has offended you, Madame Fraser?
Help me!<eos> I can see the Krauts on the left.<eos> I'll try to circle around to the right, see if I can find a way across.<eos> Stay put.<eos> I'll be back for you.
I know the games. I have played them all.<eos> If you ever wish to be in my bed again, that is the last one you will ever play with me.<eos> Yes?<eos> Miss Guthrie's downstairs.<eos> She's asking for you.
- Are you seriously doing this?<eos> - Sorry for the interruption.<eos> Official police business, sorry.<eos> You couldn't wait till you got outside?<eos> I need you to back up!
We guarantee you a place in our administration after my two years as Chief of Staff.<eos> Tell me what's happening in Texas.<eos> - Mrs. Underwood.<eos> - Congresswoman, so good to see you.<eos> Wonderful to see you, too.
- They report the group took a defensive formation and fired first.<eos> As if they had advance warning of what was coming.<eos> Maybe that's because your agents looked nothing like dock workers.<eos> You will lead us to these people.<eos> We will follow you at a discreet distance.
Paul Spector.<eos> Paul Spector?<eos> Detective Sergeant Anderson.<eos> I'm arresting you for the unlawful imprisonment of Rose Stagg.<eos> Sally-Ann Spector, I'm arresting you on suspicion of perverting the course of justice.
Nice to meet you.<eos> Let me help you with your luggage.<eos> Did you find the place okay?<eos> I did.<eos> I don't know if you've already been informed, but we just got word that Dr. Shapiro has been detained.
A great day.<eos> Special day.<eos> I'd like to discuss the incident, if that's okay.<eos> Yes.<eos> What would you like to know?
So you assess this whole anticipated profit thing. And then what?<eos> Then I make my recommendation to corporate.<eos> You'll have to forgive Amy's curiosity.<eos> Dr. Cheng, may I present miss Weathers.<eos> It's a pleasure to finally meet you. Have we not met before?
Dr. Cheng, may I present miss Weathers.<eos> It's a pleasure to finally meet you. Have we not met before?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> I'm sure I would have remembered.<eos> So glad you could join us.
I'm sure I would have remembered.<eos> So glad you could join us.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So, miss Weathers...<eos> I imagine that corporate has granted you unreserved authority here.
Let's keep moving.<eos> - You're sick, Dr Caldwell.<eos> - I'm fine.<eos> You smell sick.<eos> I saw you.
Is there somewhere else, another field base close enough for us to get to?<eos> Shit, why has she left the doors open?<eos> Caroline. What are you doing?<eos> I'm much faster than you, Dr Caldwell.<eos> If you try to cut me, I'll bite you. I don't think you'd like that.
Exhibit number four was also turned in to our hearing officer five days before this trial began.<eos> Now, if it pleases the court, you'll note that the photograph shows the remnants of a crushed back side door.<eos> - This photograph was taken at the scene...<eos> - Mrs. Hopewell.<eos> I'm seeing you around the courthouse quite often these days.
Bully.<eos> Mrs. Allen, more than anyone, wants to know who killed her husband.<eos> Well, then maybe she can tell me how Carl Nash knew she'd be at that bank that morning.<eos> As I've said until I am blue in the face, I don't know.<eos> Did you double-cross him, or did he double-cross you?
The box was in her name, too.<eos> She didn't have to wait for probate.<eos> What do you think's in that backpack?<eos> I'm betting it's not the Allen family photos.<eos> Layla outsmarted you and Nash both.
You can go ahead and step down now. We got this.<eos> Boston FBI? No, ma'am.<eos> We're from Quantico.<eos> Well, I'm from Framingham, Massachusetts, and this is my spot, and I ain't fuckin' leaving.<eos> Glad to have you with us, ma'am.
So what can you tell us about Adam?<eos> He was very quiet, very hard-working, he didn't go out much.<eos> So, nothing unusual's happened over the last few days, weeks?<eos> Apart from Adam getting himself killed, I mean.<eos> He didn't say or do anything that made you think twice?
And the fact that you've chosen mediation is a very positive sign in and of itself.<eos> - I like you.
You should listen to me for the good of your son.<eos> I don't understand, are you a psychologist?<eos> I'm much more than that.<eos> Never mind...<eos> May I have a word with you as well?
- This ain't that bad. - It ain't?<eos> Then hell, I guess I should put this to better use.<eos> Why is you's pretending?<eos> We all pretending' in some way.<eos> It's nice to meet you properly, Miss Rose.
Excuse me. Miss Lipstadt?<eos> Yes, that's me.<eos> May I speak to you? Yes.<eos> Um, could you give us a minute, please?<eos> I would like you to come and meet some of my friends.
I'm their nurse.<eos> Please. Proceed.<eos> I intend to address a wide array of matters...<eos> Diet, letter writing, attending to the doctors as they need help.<eos> I would ask that you, miss Hastings, be charged with training us all in wound dressing as you are so clearly expert at it.
So, she, uh, doesn't have a love interest?<eos> Um, uh... we haven't found the right actor yet.<eos> If you have nothing to hide, you'll hand over a complete list of employees at Isodyne Energy.<eos> I'm a patriot and I would gladly help, but Isodyne Energy deals in classified and confidential United States government contracts.<eos> If you get proper clearance, I will give you a tour myself.
So, what happened out there?<eos> Uh, we were headed out to dinner, and some nut in a pickup truck just flew by us like 100 miles per hour, and... and we swerved.<eos> Kenny, I'm gonna need a lac tray set up with 4-0 Prolene.<eos> Yep, got it.<eos> Let's get you fixed up, and I promise we'll let you know
What if it comes down to the Machine or us?<eos> Do we kill it?<eos> The Machine's our only chance of survival.<eos> We can't hurt her.<eos> If I have to choose between it... and you.
I'm sorry?<eos> Why did you become a teacher?<eos> - This isn't about me.<eos> - But it is.<eos> It's about you and Steve, and the play, cast of two, setting, classroom, over many dimensions through time.
-No, I'm a scientist. -Hmm.<eos> That's obscure work for a scientist to know.<eos> It's part of my study.<eos> What do you study?<eos> You.
But I'm not sure anyone's told him.<eos> Why am I telling you this?<eos> I don't know you.<eos> Me neither.<eos> Do you have a name, or do I keep calling you "Home"?
You can continue to work.<eos> If you won't take the business, I can sell.<eos> You find a job in a place with good people, with the right kind of business.<eos> This is exactly the business I want.<eos> She's gonna bribe you to put me on the street.
We put our pearls on one strand at a time.<eos> And they are just letting anyone waltz onto the studio lot these days.<eos> I find being polite and asking nicely opens many doors.<eos> Oh, I'm sure it does.<eos> Actually, I wanted to ask you about the incident at Isodyne.
Not a thing.<eos> Oh, please.<eos> The thought of my husband's work gives me a terrible migraine.<eos> But you were there the night of the explosion.<eos> A security guard saw you at the lab just before the accident.
They're more reliable than what I'm told to believe.<eos> And what are your instincts telling you now?<eos> That things aren't what they seem.<eos> Yes.<eos> Miss Frost, we're ready for you, sweetheart.
Field work?<eos> But they don't send women into the field.<eos> Resistance networks all over Europe need people who won't draw attention walking down the street.<eos> They need women.<eos> And they're recruiting you.
There is no legitimate reason to prevent the SSR enforcing the law, even on those who believe they are above it.<eos> How are you enjoying your vacation, Agent Carter?<eos> Vigorously.<eos> Jack Thompson thinks very highly of you.<eos> He says that you're quite the independent thinker.
Shut up, Calvin.<eos> Miss Frost, you've been exposed to a substance that I believe is altering your physiology.<eos> Don't talk about something that you don't understand.<eos> The SSR can help.<eos> We can fix you if you let us.
Sir, you can't give her those.<eos> Why not?<eos> She'll just try to use them to claw her face open.<eos> There's my beautiful girl.<eos> I'd be quite happy to take you on to the airport, Miss Carter.
We don't believe in chemical anesthesia at the institute. The impurities inhibit the cure.<eos> But, you will find that with a proper focus... the mind can overcome any amount of pain.<eos> Trust, Mr. Lockhart.<eos> I mean, if we can't trust each other... then how can I help you?<eos> Mrs. Abramov... so glad that you are here.
I wanted you to meet my friend, Kate Sacker.<eos> We were in Tiger Inn together.<eos> And she's a voracious reader.<eos> Hello there.<eos> What brings you to this haven of words and wine?
I... is the motel open?<eos> I just need a room for a few nights.<eos> Do you take cash?<eos> Okay, of course.<eos> I'll check you in.
You're isolated.<eos> You think you're the cause of this unhappiness and are unworthy of affection so you've few friends.<eos> Recently you lost something you think very important.<eos> Your lover, your faith, your family, or all three.<eos> You blame yourself for this, so it makes you neurotic, and you don't sleep and don't eat anything healthy anyway.
Pat never charged me.<eos> That one was on the house.<eos> Shit!<eos> Sorry.<eos> -Sorry. I was not aiming for you.
Hello, Miss Ives.<eos> Oh, do sit down.<eos> The doctor is just finishing up with another patient.<eos> Thank you.<eos> When you've completed your session I'll need you to fill out some documentation.
I just learned today that Limestone College, founded in 1845, was the first women's college in South Carolina, and one of the first in the nation.<eos> And that's something to be proud of.<eos> And since then, this school and its students have flourished.<eos> A young, eager community of men and women of all races and backgrounds, a true reflection of America's future.<eos> How did he convince you to come back?
-I'm... The things I've--<eos> -Don't make us get security involved.<eos> -Please. Just-- Just give us five minutes until she's out of the building.<eos> Please. Please listen to me.<eos> I'm... I'm begging you.
- I'm sorry, ma'am.<eos> You can't force me to stay in here.<eos> There is a current, highly credible threat to your life--<eos> I need to speak to your supervising--<eos> I am the head of your detail here in Dallas, ma'am, and I've been ordered to keep you securely in this house.
I'm looking for Miranda Collins.<eos> Yeah, it's right through that door.<eos> - But, can I help you with the rip?<eos> - No, I'm...<eos> Sorry, watch out behind you.
Redirect, Your Honor?<eos> Ms. Kinney, I understand that you attended a service at Ms. Wesley's church a short while ago.<eos> -Is that correct? -Yes, that's correct.<eos> It was an event honoring several students who attend that church for their community service.<eos> And who was it that invited you to that service?
Are the police just going to go along with the same racist stereotype?<eos> This is just a savage murder.<eos> It has nothing to do with who we are, or how we live.<eos> Please, I'm sorry.<eos> I apologize if I've offended you. I've just...
I'm afraid I simply misspoke the other day, Mrs. Goble.<eos> I've been away for a long time.<eos> I imagine I'm just out of practice.<eos> I was hoping you'd allow me to start over.<eos> See, the thing is... I have an interest in getting to know you better.
It is torture.<eos> I'll have to undo it all before morning.<eos> They can't know.<eos> They'd sack me if they knew.<eos> And then who'd attend to you?
Miss...<eos> Listen, we can keep doing this all day, Jane... or whatever you're calling yourself these days.<eos> - What do you want?<eos> - Well, you know what I want.<eos> I gotta get you to move on out of here or I'm taking you with me, and that's your choice.
The Oxford boy.<eos> For mercy's sake, Mr. Crane, if I may be blunt, I have no need for a counterpart.<eos> And the last thing I want is to be responsible for some trigger-happy revolutionary or, in your case, a rebellious bookworm.<eos> I'm quite capable, thank you.<eos> And your roster of former partners suggests I'm to be a moderating influence to you, not the other way around.
Here, follow my lead.<eos> Who's there?<eos> Why are you in my room?<eos> Oh, hi.<eos> You died, and I'm here to take you to heaven.
My God, I love the way that sounds.<eos> You go anywhere near Sean, and I will set you on fire in your fucking sleep.<eos> About that appointment.<eos> We can't do it today, but we can schedule for next week.<eos> You'll be medicated, so you'll need somebody to pick you up.
Ha. A very respectable 40 percent refund from the florist.<eos> New friend made.<eos> Flies, honey. Oh, right, your mother had the same thing.<eos> Except with clots.<eos> That must have been very upsetting for you, Mrs. Mathison.
And a counterfeiter named Leah Wells gave them everything else they needed to replace your fortune with fakes.<eos> As we speak, the caterers are moving money from your vault, through the kitchen, and straight out the back door.<eos> But the real payoff for Sybil isn't the robbery.<eos> It's when you try to spend the fake cash.<eos> The bills will be flagged as counterfeits, your business associates will drop you, you'll be in jail, and Sybil Griffiths will move in, taking your clients and your trade routes, leaving you with nothing.
So, then I'd be asking,<eos> "What if the person who called in the anonymous tip put the painting there, and who made this call?"<eos> And who has the most to gain from both of us sitting in this room, wasting our time, when we should be out trying to catch this person?<eos> But I don't want to tell you how to do your job.<eos> So... Unless you have a warrant for my arrest to go with your search warrant... I'm gonna go and do your job for you.
I need privacy.<eos> "Dear Miss Shippen, I am pleased to hear from Miss Franks of your impending union.<eos> Allow me to wish you the greatest joy.<eos> Your friends here remark how they hope one day to meet your future husband, but they well understand the obstacles to such a meeting.<eos> And though they miss you dreadfully, they know you are doing everything you can to ensure the brightest future possible."
W-w-why?<eos> Why? Where we goin'?<eos> I'll tell you on the way.<eos> On the way where? ! Sh...<eos> I'm counting on you. You know that?
And you know how it ended.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> Fine. Listen to me.<eos> If you want to talk to someone, you know where to find me.<eos> I'm worried about you.
Who is that?<eos> Never heard of her.<eos> Clifton: Hello, miss Simone.<eos> My name is Clifton.<eos> Just gonna prep you for your shot.
We've spoken to Eric's parents.<eos> They've given us permission to access their cellular and Internet service providers.<eos> Okay.<eos> So? With that information, we'll be able to determine the authenticity of these exchanges.<eos> I would really encourage you to have a conversation with your son.
That'd be my guess.<eos> The woman?<eos> I've never seen her before.<eos> Well, they're re-opening your gallery.<eos> Apparently she's the new you.
Have a seat, Martha.<eos> I've had second thoughts about your resignation.<eos> Would you like to remain as attorney general? Yes, I would.<eos> Thank you, Doug.<eos> Did Heather Dunbar inform you of a meeting between herself and Lucas Goodwin?
Okay, well, you're looking at one.<eos> My class in Quantico was class 307.<eos> And we had a... a motto.<eos> It was a saying, yeah? It was, "One shot, one kill."<eos> The point is, if I wanted you dead, you'd be dead.
He just escaped.<eos> Miss Page? Yeah.<eos> Agent Gallagher.<eos> Follow me.<eos> I'll get you through security as quickly as possible.
That boy was the definition of "loyal."<eos> Or was. Before Frank Castle murdered him.<eos> Colonel, please. I just...<eos> I just think I should go.<eos> I'll walk you out.
Her name was Ruth Marchon.<eos> Ms. Marchon taught art at Midvale.<eos> And that's a trick question, because I didn't transfer there until the eighth grade.<eos> Hmm.<eos> Now, have I convinced you, Ms. Grant?
I'll bring it in.<eos> Your stem cell facial is confirmed with Philip, he'll be at your house at 7:00 a.m.<eos> Gentle reminder, he does have multiple face tattoos, - so don't call 911 this time.<eos> - Anything else?<eos> Your car's out front to take you to dinner with Adam.
What are you getting at, Senator?<eos> Nothing except whispers in Washington that say you need to clean house.<eos> They say Supergirl's not the only alien inside the DEO.<eos> You've got a mole, Henshaw.<eos> Madam, I trust you won't be insulted if I called you paranoid.
At least now we can really talk to each other.<eos> Yeah, why's that? 'Cause we're on the same side.<eos> Believe it or not, that ain't never gonna be true.<eos> Well, we want the same thing. Close enough for government work, as they say.<eos> You know two men are dead because of you?
Help me!<eos> - How's it going, ma'am? - You all right?<eos> Good.<eos> It's gonna be okay.<eos> We're gonna take care of you.
Narcan. Heroin antidote.<eos> All the agents looking for you have it.<eos> Liz Kenyon, you killed Kevin Whitfield, didn't you?<eos> I took him to protect him.<eos> Yeah, well, now I'm taking you.
It's... You know what?<eos> Screw you and screw this.<eos> There were monsters, they were real, and they were after me.<eos> And now no one's gonna stop them.<eos> Ma'am, I can drive you home now.
You want me to get a DNA sample of the blood from an elf ear?<eos> No, he tried to grab it back.<eos> I want you to run this bloody fingerprint right here.<eos> Swelling's gone down nicely.<eos> Now, don't be surprised if someone mistakes you for your daughter. Oh!
Mr. Lawson.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So kind of you to visit.<eos> Uh, yes, I wish it were just for that.<eos> Uh, Ms. Underhill, I just wanted to apologize to you personally for this hacking incident.
A ten-year-old girl hid in a wardrobe.<eos> At one point she crept out of her hiding place.<eos> And saw a pregnant, dark-haired woman burning her mother's breasts with a candle flame.<eos> And after her mother had revealed the location of the family safe... ..she slit her throat.<eos> This morning the young girl identified you... ..as the woman who tortured and murdered her mother.
He is a film producer.<eos> He is a ringleader of murderers and thieves.<eos> He kept them high on dope in conditions you wouldn't keep an animal. No.<eos> He got them to murder and rob the farms they knew in Picardie in order to fund his life at Maxim's and the George V. No.<eos> And you.
Not yet.<eos> But if I could please ask you to give us a mo...<eos> I am so sorry that we are meeting under these circumstances.<eos> I can't imagine what you're going through.<eos> My thoughts and prayers are with you and your son Malik.
If I were you, I'd keep your snide remarks to yourself.<eos> We agreed you'd stay away!<eos> - Honoria's sleeping.<eos> - I'm not here to see Honoria.<eos> - It's you I want to talk to.
Just answer the questions asked of you.<eos> Sorry.<eos> No, he did not seem like a crazy person.<eos> He told me that I was collateral damage and that he never meant for me to be caught in the middle of all this.<eos> And that's when he let you go.
And that's when he let you go.<eos> Basically, yes.<eos> Thank you, Miss Carver.<eos> How was it to be face-to-face with Wilson Corvo again?<eos> Did he hurt you that night?
I've had the most incredible night.<eos> Sometimes the Lord does smile on us, doesn't He?<eos> He certainly does.<eos> Hallelujah.<eos> I've been watching you.
So that's where you're hiding.<eos> They told me there wasn't one of you, and I don't mind telling you, I was a little worried.<eos> Well, no need to be rude.<eos> Ms. Blum. You scared me.<eos> Well, let's get you back.
That's my girl.<eos> Hello!<eos> Mrs Durrell?<eos> Theodore Stephanides.<eos> Delighted to finally meet you.
How do we make sure we get them back?<eos> It's a setback. I've overcome worse.<eos> My corporate attorneys told me not to hire you, but every judge and lawyer friend I know told me that we would need a woman if we had any chance at winning.<eos> And with a jury made up mostly of minorities, a woman of color would be best.<eos> So I found you.
Miss Cobbina. Miss Cobbina.<eos> No, I-I don't want to know. I don't want to know.<eos> I don't want to know. No, you don't understand what they're doing there.<eos> He's not dead.<eos> I'll take you.
What's all this?<eos> Nothing you...<eos> Nothing you need concern yourself with, Mr Crabb.<eos> Mr Grove, are you in pain?<eos> Mr Selfridge and Miss Arden will see you now.
Shall we get started?<eos> - Oh...<eos> Right now? - We have three days to get this concession up and running.<eos> After that I've got to get back to New York.<eos> - I'll leave you in the capable hands of Mrs Edwards.
I only have time for a few.<eos> Welcome to Atlanta, Mrs. Underwood.<eos> Thank you. Can you comment on Senator Sheer's vote?<eos> Well, I am flattered. But it's all in good fun, I'm sure.<eos> Mrs. Underwood, he says he'll vote for you again.
She's with me.<eos> Come along. Thank you.<eos> - He's awake.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> Actually, he's asked to see you.
That Vincent was part of some secret super soldier program. That Hill went outside of DHS, possibly hired Graydal Securities to kill your husband, but Vincent killed him, instead.<eos> How am I doing so far?<eos> Like I said, I have my sources, but you should know<eos> I protect my sources, I protect their anonymity.<eos> Which means, I protect you, too.
Tonight?<eos> Yeah, sure, Alex, I'd love to.<eos> Captain, we need to talk.<eos> Can I call you back?<eos> Agent Chandler alerted you, didn't she?
I thought we were going to make deposits at the bank.<eos> Just close your bag and act normal, okay?<eos> Good evening, ma'am.<eos> May I see your license and registration?<eos> I'm stopping you because you made an improper lane change about a mile and a half back.
OK, so let's try again, shall we?<eos> When you were a prison visitor to Jakob Marosi, did you ever send letters on his behalf?<eos> Did you think there was something I didn't wanna say in front of my husband?<eos> Is there?<eos> Mrs Clarke, did Jakob Marosi ever ask you to smuggle letters out for him?
Most marriages don't survive something like that, do they?<eos> Losing a child.<eos> An experience like that changes people. Permanently.<eos> I'd have said so.<eos> How did it change you?
It didn't define who I am.<eos> You don't appear sad.<eos> I'm sorry, I don't mean to contradict the fact the fact that you are sad.<eos> Only you know how you feel.<eos> But your colleagues, your friends at work, I get the idea that they see you as the life and soul of the party.
These gentlemen need to talk to you.<eos> This is... Miss Wealand.<eos> Frances Elizabeth Drummond.<eos> Sorry?<eos> I'm arresting you on suspicion of fraud by false representation, contrary to section two of the Fraud Act 2006.
You've been here under false pretences.<eos> - Think about Ryan.<eos> - I have to explain that to the parents and to the governors and to the children.<eos> - Think about Ryan.<eos> - They liked you.
Un peu. Uh, may I help you, miss?<eos> No, I'm good.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Merci.<eos> Well, you sure I can't offer you a ride?
Good talk, though.<eos> Nice bike, princess.<eos> "Men will go into caves of the rocks..."<eos> This could've been a trap.<eos> He could've been luring you here to kill you, Mrs. Bennett.
It's a life of... pretence.<eos> And I admit I've been pretending to you since the day we met.<eos> Pretending?<eos> Pretending that I don't love you more than I've loved another person in my life.<eos> I want to walk by your side for the rest of my days, share everything I have with you.
Cast me aside.<eos> I could have ended up a street woman.<eos> I thought I might throw myself from a bridge at Blackfriars and let the river take me.<eos> But my brother searched for me, found me and kept me safe.<eos> But I saw him embrace you.
I've no such thing, sir.<eos> Sir Hugh Bodrugan has heard different.<eos> His prize cow Sheba is sick.<eos> He'd esteem it the greatest of favours if you'd cast your eye over the beast and prescribe a remedy.<eos> - He asked for you particularly.
We need to build a new team to take us forward.<eos> People look up to you.<eos> And you know better than anyone how this place works.<eos> I-I-I couldn't.<eos> Mr Grove held you in the highest regard.
With the right support, nothing is insurmountable.<eos> Tell Mr Lyons I need to meet him before lunch.<eos> Mr Selfridge, I'd like you to meet our new Head of the Sewing Room. Miss Brockless.<eos> Madame Rennard had nothing but praise for her.<eos> I'm glad to have you on board.
Everybody likes apples.<eos> Are you all right, ma'am?<eos> I don't know what's happening. I -- i'm dizzy.<eos> Hang on.<eos> I got you.
And in the interest of time, we waive any formal reading<eos> Of the rights and charges.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> That may be the ordinary course of business, But there is nothing ordinary about the charges Against your client.<eos> Ms. Keen, the united states government has charged you With 16 counts of capital murder.
He stole from you? - Unless you're somehow tied to this mishap?<eos> - No, no, I know, I didn't steal anything.<eos> But Cisco, yeah, you what, what..<eos> He, what did he do?<eos> He was by.. He stole from you?
Oh I can understand that, but you were late. Thomas.<eos> You sit here and drink your water, pet. Thank you.<eos> So now you're gonna sanction me so, er... - No, I'm not gonna sanction you. - I may not get any money for a month.<eos> I'm gonna refer you to the decision maker and they'll make the decision<eos> - on whether they're gonna sanction you. - That's ridiculous...
So now you're gonna sanction me so, er... - No, I'm not gonna sanction you. - I may not get any money for a month.<eos> I'm gonna refer you to the decision maker and they'll make the decision<eos> - on whether they're gonna sanction you. - That's ridiculous...<eos> I'm not actually making the decision, they're gonna do that.<eos> And then if they do decide to sanction you, then you will take a 40% cut in your benefits.
You've just confirmed she subsequently met you later that night without her detail, after which she left, totally unaccounted for, on the last night Tom Carter was seen alive.<eos> The only person who knows where Jane really was that night is Jane.<eos> So, stop me if I'm getting any of this wrong.<eos> Tom Carter didn't trust you.<eos> He wanted you in his custody. He would stop at nothing to get you.
No one's confirmed that Carter is even dead.<eos> Are you confirming that he's dead?<eos> Your polygraph is practically a straight line.<eos> I've seen sociopaths with more spikes.<eos> The truth is, you were kidnapped at the age of five.
Are you confirming that he's dead?<eos> Your polygraph is practically a straight line.<eos> I've seen sociopaths with more spikes.<eos> The truth is, you were kidnapped at the age of five.<eos> You were trafficked to Russia, you were taught the language. You were taught to lie, you were trained to fight.
Reade suspected it. But Carter proved it.<eos> And he and Agent Patterson's boyfriend were murdered because of it.<eos> You actually spoke Russian to a fellow Russian spy in this very room.<eos> Olivia Delidio recognized you.<eos> But before she could name you, your handlers had her killed.
Are you all right?<eos> ! Are you hurt?<eos> No, no, no!<eos> Please, stop!<eos> Stop! I have to get you to a hospital!
Too busy to talk to her own mother more than once a week, and then when she does call, she won't stop harping on the nursing home.<eos> You can't call a structure covered in spray-on stucco "golden" anything.<eos> I'm speaking to you.<eos> Please don't stand there like a half-wit.<eos> She worries about you.
Exciting, isn't it?<eos> Yes, sir!<eos> Okay, see you guys tomorrow.<eos> Shit!<eos> Miss Kapoor, has called you an emerging voice in modern art.
Great view of the water.<eos> On the corner, in fact.<eos> He has a corner office?<eos> Only the best for Claire and Clayton's kid, right?<eos> If you want, I can transfer you to the woman who will be his assistant.
She's the one you need to convince, not him.<eos> I see. Yes. You still believe it's here, don't you?<eos> You haven't given up?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Now, this whole area here has been quartered and charted and we are now preparing to work our way... right up into the neck of the Valley behind you.
Maybe pick up a mascara, too.<eos> Uh, the pink one.<eos> And then we'll do a whole lesson, okay?<eos> - Okay. Great, I gotta go.<eos> I'm gonna think about ways on how to make your eyes really pop and make you really cute.
Well, I'll see you in a few seconds.<eos> Yeah, bye.<eos> All right, we got six more votes this morning.<eos> - We're never gonna close that gap.<eos> Well, on the less shitty side, people are really loving you and Charlie Baird.
From climate change to human rights.<eos> We shall be in touch.<eos> Thank you, Ambassador Al...<eos> Well, that was mysterious, right?<eos> - Ma'am. - Yeah? - They're ready for you.
I know you had an eye job.<eos> You made the right call on the banks, ma'am.<eos> Well, you can thank "When Gary Met Sally" for that one.<eos> He gave me some sappy speech and made me realize what an idiot I was being.<eos> In further good news, ma'am, Jonah had a huge polling bump since he hit on the strategy of attacking you.
Great. And now they are discussing how casually you are dressed.<eos> Hmm? They say you look like a prisoner or a pirate.<eos> An exercise book.<eos> Why did Menopause not warn us that the Chinese were going to out gift us like that?<eos> Our intel suggested they hated you.
- Did we get it?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Okay, great.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - I love you. - Oh.
It's President Elect Sandwich.<eos> We might not want to get too far ahead of ourselves.<eos> Troll Trace must be stopped.<eos> Who is Skankhunt42?<eos> We believe... he's the only one who can save you now.
I don't keep an eye on Mateo.<eos> You sure you didn't hear anything?<eos> The van starting, the garage opening...<eos> I told you... no.<eos> Then beyond you and Mateo, anyone else have access to the van?
Should you need to speak with me, place a candle in your window.<eos> Miss Castello?<eos> You will be watched.<eos> So you play the innocent for now.<eos> Else he will see you dead, understand?
- No.<eos> Ah, yes... dinner.<eos> And Luca and I met while I was working at the Marbella.<eos> - It's nice to meet you.<eos> - You, too.
Fire Department.<eos> Call out.<eos> Call out.<eos> Here!<eos> Let's get you out of here!
I would love to see him.<eos> I'll tell him.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It's lovely to have met you.<eos> You, too.
Mr. Maxwell let his guard down as he spoke to you.<eos> The snipers were able to wound him.<eos> He is being treated.<eos> He will recover.<eos> The president wishes to see you immediately.
It's over.<eos> We're going home without a trade agreement.<eos> Called the president;<eos> I'm not sure the hearing in that ear will ever recover.<eos> He's got a lot of nerve holding you accountable.
No, no.<eos> Livewire has escaped.<eos> She could be anywhere now, but you know where she'll come eventually.<eos> So head home and pack.<eos> I will arrange a car to take you and Carter to the airport and a plane, and guards.
Hank didn't kill Astra.<eos> I did.<eos> Ma'am, Colonel Harper just resigned and named a new acting director of the DEO.<eos> - Who?<eos> - You.
- It's scary.<eos> - It is.<eos> My kids are in there too.<eos> We have a job to do and it is not safe for you to be here right now.<eos> Officer Johnston, please... he's going to escort you to the meeting area.
Your lips are looking a little dry.<eos> - I just want to see if I have that balm.<eos> - Oh, goodie. Kent:<eos> Ben is bringing over Vice President Doyle.<eos> He insisted on seeing you.
We won't do anything.<eos> Is that what you want?<eos> It's what he wants.<eos> You sure?<eos> I could take you to the waiting room if you'd like, Mrs. Nicholson.
Tia... The law says that you can make your own decisions here.<eos> So let me ask you again, do you want our help?<eos> She doesn't want your surgery.<eos> And I don't want you or anyone else here speaking to her anymore.<eos> We'll pray for you, Doctor.
Be careful.<eos> "The struggle is real.<eos> Props for the good looks. Boom."<eos> Ms. Charles?<eos> Mr. Deaux is still waiting to see you.
Which is why it's so important for us to always remind him of that.<eos> French and creole is part of Samuel's foundation, and I want to honor it.<eos> So can we come back every year?<eos> Yes.<eos> I love you, Mrs. Wagner.
Are we clear?<eos> Crystal, ma'am.<eos> That's great to hear, Sam.<eos> Hi, there.<eos> I'm Abby Whelan, and I'm just gonna need a couple of things before you go in.
No.<eos> No, he's... he's fine.<eos> - I need to see him.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I can take you to his room.
Never mind.<eos> It's not important.<eos> Is there anything you need to tell me?<eos> No.<eos> Here, let me walk you out.
I mean, if it helps, I could give you a list of facilities around here that do that kind of work.<eos> Welcome.<eos> If I can help you with anything, let me know.<eos> Um, actually, I was hoping I could talk to you about the building you turned into an AwayKay.<eos> I remember you.
Some people thought she was his daughter.<eos> Others thought she was his wife.<eos> The only thing we know for sure is that she was allowed to leave the house sometimes.<eos> That's how the imposter was able to gain access to her.<eos> You can imagine she's been through quite an ordeal, but she remembers you and Richard, and she's been asking for you.
I just drove all the way from Salem.<eos> I confirmed this. Are you sure you have the right clinic?<eos> Yeah, the Foy Cream, right?<eos> Dr. Forbes?<eos> Look, I'll try to squeeze you in, but you'll have to wait.
I do, don't I?<eos> Oh, I'm so glad I came. My husband's gonna think he's having an affair.<eos> And I might have one myself.<eos> Ms. Calvert?<eos> Dr. Forbes will see you now.
May I have the honour?<eos> - I thought you weren't going to come.<eos> - I had a matter to attend to.<eos> - I thought perhaps you were cross with me.<eos> - You?
It's always easier to give advice than it is to follow it, Ma'am.<eos> I'm afraid.<eos> I know, Ma'am, but I also know how much courage you have.<eos> Lady Flora.<eos> I'm sorry to see you so unwell, but I'm sure with rest and care you'll soon be on your feet again.
- Just leave me alone.<eos> -Were you aware that your son was among the captives before that footage came out?<eos> Please, I don't want to talk about this now.<eos> The President said that he tried to reach out to all of the families.<eos> How long did it take before the administration found you?
Grace showed me.<eos> She wanted me to sign a release, but I wouldn't do it.<eos> A week later, I get a call from her editor, lady's name was Lerna Stern, saying they'd changed the character's name and hair color, and they felt confident enough to go ahead and publish without my release.<eos> Did Grace offer to use a pen name?<eos> Help disguise you that way?
He was in Seattle infiltrating a gang of bank robbers.<eos> I'll run this by Bozzio.<eos> If she bears your children, you'll start using her first name, right?<eos> Thank you for your help, Miss Schafer.<eos> I'll show you out.
They will be.<eos> Your friend Meng Zhou isn't so certain.<eos> This wasn't Triad business.<eos> The killer was a white man.<eos> He got close to the three victims by disguising himself as you.
You go and find Debbie and you look after her.<eos> And you wait for me.<eos> You wait.<eos> I love you, beautiful girl.<eos> Governor? I need to speak to you.
For anyone not feel sorry.<eos> There are just lies, I myself am the god of lies.<eos> But I will not lie to you.<eos> Trapped am knyaginyo Marfa.<eos> I love you.
And it's easy to fool you.<eos> It turns your influence a Mr. Yakovlev.<eos> Mr. Yakovlev is duelist.<eos> He desperately needs in Death of Count Beklemishev.<eos> What connects you with this gentleman?
Your hands.<eos> - 29 ... 30!<eos> - Please accept, my love and my protection.<eos> I want to know ... that love to you I will kill everyone.<eos> Even you, if you must.
Get a hansom to, ah, Albert Gate.<eos> French Embassy.<eos> Wake them. Do not leave until they have provided you with full, photographic details of this man. Blanchard.<eos> Miss Dobrowski.<eos> I'm relieved to finally meet you in person.
I would say I'm too young for marriage, Mrs. Drake.<eos> Too young?<eos> Shall I tell you all I had lived by 19 years of age?<eos> I should be interested to know, Mrs. Drake.<eos> But I am quite aware of the needs and necessities which drive those of our sex to the life you led before the music halls welcomed you.
She told me to come here.<eos> Alicia Mendez trained here.<eos> Mendes.<eos> That's--, it's her.<eos> - I can take you to her.
Resubbed By Tetrazolium SADAKO VS. KAYAKO<eos> Excuse me!<eos> Yatsue San!<eos> I'm a welfare officer of Tachibana district, we have been trying to contact you, are you okay?
What do you mean?<eos> You really want to see Sadako?<eos> If you want to die it is up to you.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Please, I beg you.
Brace yourself. One hundred pounds.<eos> - What?<eos> - Oh, I'm sorry. Is that too dear?<eos> - No, it's absurd.<eos> - On the contrary, it's entirely fair, given it'll end up costing you tens of thousands.
- Thank you. I have a feeling I will be.<eos> I can get the place cleared out inside a week.<eos> Oh, only if you've somewhere to go.<eos> I do. My sister's a few miles down the coast.<eos> Now, will I walk you back to the Vyners? Down wind?
I'm glad you're alone.<eos> I've been meaning to say how proud I am of you.<eos> Oh. For what?<eos> For breaking up with Mr. Castle, of course.<eos> Now you're free to meet a man who can really appreciate you.
- Thank you.<eos> - Get on this thing.<eos> - Detective Pilgrim?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Detective Walker wants to see you in the morgue.
But sometimes it is.<eos> We have a recording that we think is Jibral Disah.<eos> All we need is confirmation.<eos> Secretary McCord, your husband is awake.<eos> He's asking for you.
Revolution!<eos> - What is that solution?<eos> - Revolution! Phillip Price, please.<eos> Your party's here.<eos> Do you want me to show you to the table?
The contemplation moves me very deeply.<eos> Wow, you weren't kidding.<eos> You really do have a thing...<eos> I apologize, I must go.<eos> May I escort you back to the party?
Thank you.<eos> I never cease to be astonished by the heroics of everyday people.<eos> Did you come all the way down from New York just for this?<eos> Or are you based in New Jersey?<eos> You know, I should probably get some contact information from you.
Really?<eos> But you are here on business, Sir Robert.<eos> Er... yes, Ma'am.<eos> Perhaps if I might have a private audience?<eos> I am here to assure you that I have enough support in the House to form a government.
His Royal Highness, the Duke of Sussex, Her Grace, the Duchess of Inverness.<eos> Uncle Sussex.<eos> May I present my wife?<eos> Your Majesty.<eos> I am glad to meet you at last... Duchess.
I still do.<eos> It may sound pathetic, but I thought we still had a chance.<eos> Well, thank you for your time.<eos> We'll leave you alone, let you get some rest.<eos> Before we go, would you mind just writing down a phone number where we can get ahold of you in case we have any more questions?
Yeah, boss.<eos> It's me. Listen, there's been a slight change of plan so if you could call me as soon as you land...<eos> Thanks.<eos> Continue straight for 150km.<eos> My name's Detective Joshua Levine, and I'm part of the task force that's been set up to track you down.
Everything.<eos> Actually, we've learned to keep her records with us.<eos> Just in case.<eos> - Thank you. - Yeah.<eos> Well, we'd like to admit you and to wean you off the IV meds that are controlling your heart rate.
Hello, he's the only reason I studied motion.<eos> Who wants to see another iteration of finite subdivisions?<eos> Not me, baby.<eos> Professor Gray, I'm Dr. Choi.<eos> I've been treating you.
If we get the cruise tickets, yes, I can live with that.<eos> I have to say, I am surprised.<eos> Mmm. I mean, you struck me as a kind of man who would do anything to keep his wife happy.<eos> I mean, think about it, Mrs. Williams.<eos> Every morning, waking up with the Pacific Ocean calling out to greet you.
Oh, I hate saying this: Good work, Hirsch.<eos> Oh, what do you know-- a compliment.<eos> HPD just grabbed Fuller at the airport.<eos> They're bringing him in. All right, good.<eos> Mrs. Williams, on April 19, 2011, agents from the New Jersey field office paid you a visit.
Just remember that in the US, a woman of power still strives to hold on to her femininity.<eos> So it's customary to compliment her body.<eos> Captain, this is Detective Lee.<eos> Detective Lee, I'm Lindsay Cole.<eos> Nice to meet you, captain.
Look, I know I don't look much like a Baskerville, and I know I kind of just came out of nowhere, but I'm happy to take a DNA test if you'd like.<eos> Did Rodger know that you were his niece when he hired you?<eos> Of course.<eos> If you won't take my word for it... take his.<eos> Uh, this is... e-mail correspondence between you and Mr. Stapleton?
- Former patient.<eos> - Um, yes.<eos> In public. So, yes, it is on purpose.<eos> Oh, first date?<eos> He's seated at the bar. He's waiting for you.
It's not the Foil, ma'am.<eos> The Foil will be released in time for back-to-school sales.<eos> - So I can keep it?<eos> - Whatever you have, you can keep.<eos> Shall I direct you to the Web site?
You... What do you mean?<eos> Your husband has a target on his back.<eos> Well, anyone in public life does.<eos> No, but not like this.<eos> No question Peter loves you, but he can hurt you.
I'm a bartender and a model.<eos> Ma'am, I'm gonna need you to step out of the vehicle.<eos> - Yes, do it, baby.<eos> - "Vehicle"?<eos> What vehicle? The metaphorical vehicle that is holding you back.
- I am calm.<eos> Bitch.<eos> - What did you say?<eos> - I said bitch.<eos> Did you automatically assume I was referring to you?
An Owen Dixon.<eos> Once an operative for...<eos> Wynnewood Security Services.<eos> Yes, I remember him.<eos> Justine knew that Dixon blamed you for what happened to his unit.
If it fails, they'll say I did.<eos> But either way, they'd only be half right.<eos> The truth is, we'd both lose.<eos> How is that?<eos> Well, if you succeed in undercutting Broken Windows, that's a nice headline for you, but when the crime rate soars-- and it will-- you'd get the blame.
- how are you doing?<eos> - I'm good. So he wants to drag me in front of the grand jury?<eos> Yes.<eos> To my mind, it's a strategic mistake.<eos> He'll look like a bully asking you over and over to invoke spousal privilege. I urge you not to get angry.
You're accusing my daughter of plagiarizing the Sermon on the...<eos> Mount.<eos> I can not confirm or deny.<eos> Do you seriously want to be sued for denying my daughter admittance because you can't tell the difference between the Sermon on the Mount within or without quotes?<eos> It was very nice meeting you, ma'am.
Hello.<eos> Uh-oh.<eos> She made a deal.<eos> I didn't make a deal.<eos> We're ready for you, Ms. Eastman.
"...preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States."<eos> ...preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States, so help me God.<eos> Mr. President.<eos> Ma'am. Mr. President, you're gonna have to come with me now.<eos> Mrs. Kirkman, the Secret Service will take you up to the residence now.
Well, it's been quite a walk.<eos> Hardly requires a house call, Doctor.<eos> What was it like to have to... beg forgiveness from a child?<eos> 'Cause that's how you got back, right?<eos> But whatever rule you broke, it was a rule you made.
Sometimes, I suppose.<eos> He would have known your husband's hobby. Bird-watching.<eos> Most people did.<eos> So he knew your husband was often away.<eos> And it seems likely he bore a grudge against you, that he blamed you for what happened to him.
- Ah, Detective Diamond.<eos> Nancy rarely talked about work, but she sure did mention you.<eos> I'm afraid to ask.<eos> She said you were stubborn as hell.<eos> And she respected you for it.
I've secured agreement for your loan to be extended for another year<eos> - You're rather impertinent.<eos> - I like you very much, too.
Then I will suffer.<eos> Ah, Miss Penvenen?<eos> Captain Poldark.<eos> Seven months away has given me an appetite for such sights.<eos> And doubtless they for you.
We are gentlemen, after all.<eos> This way, please, sir.<eos> Good day to you both.<eos> You know my wife, Demelza.<eos> Good day to you, ma'am.
And I got the impression that she thinks her circumstances were about to change.<eos> Is it not dangerous, Captain, riding when you're not recovered?<eos> You leave me no choice!<eos> I was hoping you'd visit me as I convalesce.<eos> Or else, that I'd, er, receive an invitation to visit you.
I thought it probable, if I posted a watch long enough, we'd discover where he was hiding.<eos> And did you post such a watch?<eos> I did not.<eos> Why?<eos> I have too great a regard for you, ma'am.
Look, sorry I was rude to you.<eos> Sometimes I think I'm funny, and I'm not.<eos> My patient could die if I don't have access to that O.R.<eos> Of course, Dr. Panttiere.<eos> I'd be delighted to stick my neck out for you.
That never happens when Dr. Panttiere's involved.<eos> - Oh, and Doctor?<eos> - Yes?<eos> You chose to give the position of CIO to her.<eos> That decision is beginning to reflect poorly on you, in the eyes of the board.
We're doing everything we can, okay? Okay?<eos> F.A.S.T. is negative.<eos> 'Cause I know what he sounds like when he can't breathe, 'cause he had pneumonia when we were in college, - so I know what he sounds like when he's...<eos> - Okay. Mrs. Wesley, I need you to listen to me.<eos> They are doing everything they can to save him. - Okay. - But we got to take care of you, too.
It's time you went back to your own life.<eos> - Lady Scatcherd!<eos> - Louis's back.<eos> I wasn't expecting him.<eos> Oh, don't tell me she's putting you up on that damn thing again!
Allow me to introduce my...<eos> Good evening, my lady.<eos> How do you do?<eos> Tolerably well, thank you, Sir Louis.<eos> I should have paid a call on you sooner, but I have been in London.
You didn't hear anything resembling a gunshot?<eos> We already told you: no.<eos> I understand you were familiar with the victim, Miss Hall?<eos> No. Not really.<eos> If you withhold the truth from me, I will be forced to add you to my list of suspects.
Thanks.<eos> Hi.<eos> I'm here to, uh, pick up the to-go order.<eos> Now, this is odd.<eos> That you'd just walk up to a bar at this hour, my old expert on Internet dating here has an order waiting for you.
Elaheh, this person has already targeted your family.<eos> You need to help us.<eos> Why can't the police do it?<eos> It will mean more coming from a member of the community.<eos> Once they hear you speak, they won't think gang member or terrorist, they'll see someone just like them.
Karen Parker?<eos> If you know anything that could be relevant, please contact the police.<eos> ♪ Theme music<eos> Lance Corporal Parker?<eos> We're ready for you upstairs.
So really I have two choices - I either resign from public life or produce a sudden success so you can claim a glorious victory.<eos> Well, technically, yes, although I'm assuming the second option is completely unrealistic at this point and certainly beyond your power to control it anyway.<eos> So that only leaves... ..resignation.<eos> Or a completely ruined reputation.<eos> The state's corruption watchdog has you in their crosshairs. When will you resign from the royal commission?
Indicating it could happen again. When you say "behavior", are you talking about his courage?<eos> No, he's been shot three times, He's been suspended for his anger issues, He's discharged his weapon<eos> So to me... It looks less like bravery and more like a death wish.<eos> If julio had a death wish, he'd be dead by now.<eos> I promise you.
Last night, this revolver was used in a murder.<eos> What?<eos> No!<eos> Yes.<eos> And this gun is registered to you.
Okay, Amy.<eos> Appointment's over.<eos> - I do. I do.<eos> - ‭Oh, good.<eos> Which is why you're under arrest, Dr. Deb.
His mother was dead, so I made sure To make good friends with my husband's accountant.<eos> "Oh, Bobby," I'd say, "you work so much harder than I do.<eos> Let me handle the bills."<eos> I don't think he understood that I was seeing checks go out, to cover these giant personal expenses On his Corporate credit card.<eos> So, you knew that Mr. Cushing was cheating on you.
I should stay with the scene of my action.<eos> Oh, uh, Sharon, the spectators and the reporters that were present?<eos> Should I continue to have the deputies hold them, too, or... Or let them go?<eos> Uh, captain, I can't believe I'm about to say this. Uh, but according to the rules...<eos> Uh, written by you... - I know.
I was too ashamed to visit Dwight in jail.<eos> And now I'll never talk to him again.<eos> I'm really sorry.<eos> I have to go.<eos> I'll... I'll walk you out.
Right, you know the deal, guys.<eos> We had a great asset inside Z, and had we used him when you were investigating the Colsons, that would have been that.<eos> But after the shooting in the courthouse, I think we need to re-evaluate how Wes can do the most good.<eos> Back with the z-brotherhood or with us.<eos> But first, captain, since you've been cleared to resume duty, obviously, I want to include you in my decision.
I devoted my life to the study of genetics, and I'm well practiced in the study of animal breeding.<eos> I'm an expert in that field.<eos> And I think I know more than anyone.<eos> Even more than you.<eos> Herr Göring must respect you very much.
You should leave with me, Dr. Korczak.<eos> But then what of the children?<eos> What of them, Dr. Zabiński?<eos> My heart is no different than yours.<eos> I should not be here, they should not be here, you should not be here.
I mean, that's the behavior of a truly, truly evil human being. I mean, what comparison is there, ever, possibly in that?<eos> And yet the "New York Times," "the newspaper of record," "all the news that's fit to print"<eos> Well, why do you think they made that comparison?<eos> - You know, when I turned myself in...<eos> - Your sons turned you in.
Miss Sasha Lazard.<eos> Taxi for you, Mr. Dutchman?<eos> My driver's here, thanks.<eos> How do you know my name?<eos> I've seen you on Mad Money and The Crunch.
Roger, sir.<eos> Private ocre.<eos> What do you say we get you back on level ground?<eos> There's a convoy leaving at 1400.<eos> It'll take you to the balad flightline and a c-130 will take you back to the states.
Where the fuck am I going to go, all these tubes stuck to me?<eos> Give a man a little bit of dignity for once, eh?<eos> Aye. All right, Frank.<eos> You're a good man, Mr. Wilson.<eos> I respect you for that.
I'm trying to help...<eos> - What if you're wrong?<eos> It doesn't matter. Mr. Riley, listen to me.<eos> Listen to me, you are under investigation.<eos> You're about to get transferred, you are gonna get transferred to a secure facility where you will receive medical treatment.
-Come on. -It's champagne.<eos> -It's a fancy drink. -I'm not drinking something that expensive.<eos> -Okay, you don't have to drink it. -It's fucking wrong.<eos> Hello, Congressman.<eos> Good to see you again. -Welcome back. -Thank you so much.
You know, the cork, the pin, the dessert.<eos> Really, it's all good. What else can I get for you?<eos> You can fucking get lost already.<eos> Of course, we can leave you alone.<eos> You know, I hope you understand that... my tolerance from your rudeness, it come from the respect I got for your brother, not from any tendency to back away from throwing a man like you out.
You nodding at me?<eos> Fuck you!<eos> No, no, no!<eos> Sorry, sir.<eos> That nod was not for you.
But you have to promise me something.<eos> You'll come back and try your luck with us again... soon, anytime... day or night.<eos> Or night.<eos> That's right.<eos> We're watching you, Mr...
This is Cole. Yes, I'll hold.<eos> - Is it him?<eos> - What?<eos> Is it him?<eos> Yes, I hear you.
She'll set something up.<eos> Megan.<eos> set up a meeting with Joy.<eos> I'll check her schedule.<eos> We should be able to squeeze you in sometime in the next two or three days.
Mr. Rand.<eos> I need this job.<eos> but it's really important.<eos> There's no one else I can turn to.<eos> you never saw me.
Lady PhD from India?<eos> ...obviously to come after your color restoration technique.<eos> Jack.<eos> This is Dr. Ashmita from the Palace Museum Research Institute of Rajasthan, India.<eos> Nice to meet you, Professor Chen.
Welcome.<eos> Our work is nothing without Professor Chen.<eos> Of course.<eos> Professor, your research in Magadha is impeccable.<eos> However, I have an important clue that might help you.
Yes, I'm from Beijing, doing postgraduate research in history.<eos> I'm also Professor Ashmita's Chinese tutor.<eos> Excuse me, Doctor.<eos> Professor Chen from China.<eos> Please to meet you.
I know damn well what is happening here.<eos> I know too much.<eos> And next, they'll come after my family.<eos> Who's they?<eos> Who do you think is after you?
What, do you want me to describe how it sounded, Detective?<eos> Perhaps you didn't hear me when I said, "Cut the shit."<eos> Now I hear they took Danny Rand.<eos> A person with that high of a profile?<eos> If this falls back on you... it's gonna make your life miserable.
Night, John.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> I'd like to see the manager.<eos> How good to see you again so soon, Mr. Wick.<eos> Shall I announce you?
Oh, he came back for love, not for you.<eos> He owed me. I had every right.<eos> And now, he's coming again.<eos> He did tell you not to do this.<eos> He did warn you.
All right.<eos> Then enjoy your kingdom Winston, while you still can.<eos> And you, its privileges, sir.<eos> I'm here to see Santino D'Antonio.<eos> He's waiting for you in the lounge, sir.
-No big deal.<eos> This pretty green in the sand, I can spot it from miles away.<eos> Hey, don't you have an oasis to watch?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I'll leave you with your family.
I fucking owe you one.<eos> - Nobody get up!<eos> - Stay where you are!<eos> Please rise.<eos> Mr. Harlon, with this court finding you guilty of assault by a prisoner with a deadly weapon
- Stay where you are!<eos> Please rise.<eos> Mr. Harlon, with this court finding you guilty of assault by a prisoner with a deadly weapon<eos> I'm sentencing you to the middle term of four years.<eos> In addition, having been found guilty of committing this crime in association and for the benefit of a gang, I'm sentencing you to an additional five years to run consecutively.
Now it's time for you to do some bleeding good among your own.<eos> Me and my wife have looked after that boy for ten years with not one penny from you and nothing but threats from the mad old bastard you just put in the ground.<eos> Now you're back, I want payment.<eos> If it wasn't for us, that kid would be sucking cocks in St Giles.<eos> Mr Ibbotson, I've been meaning to pay you a visit.
For the safe.<eos> You witnessed the division of the gunpowder and you heard its destination?<eos> On direct instruction of James Delaney himself, sir.<eos> We have Delaney, we have Nootka, we have the China trade.<eos> They will walk you along a tightrope. A line between life and death.
I may need to prove to a tribunal that the land was acquired by treaty and not by conquest.<eos> Tribunal?<eos> Yeah. Or they'll proudly try to seize it and claim it as a spoil of war.<eos> Sir, I have seen nae deerskin treaty, nor have I seen fairies or water sprites.<eos> But what I do have are Malay coins, enough to bury you.
I'm off-duty.<eos> I have a wound in my left shoulder.<eos> A bullet wound?<eos> A splinter... from the mast of a ship called the Yankee Prize... that was struck by a Yankee ball.<eos> So I should call you comrade?
So why don't you just take her?<eos> Just take her with you.<eos> No more hiding.<eos> We can guarantee you safe passage, anonymity... new worlds.<eos> But look, if you don't want to deal with the obstacle, we can certainly take care of that for you.
Yes. I know this, too.<eos> What do you want?<eos> As far as I can ascertain... you are the only surviving member of the crew of the Cornwallis.<eos> I want you to write an account, naming Sir Stuart Strange as the man who organised the loading of the Cornwallis with slaves... bound for a sugar plantation in Jumby Bay, Antigua... owned by his own brother.<eos> In return, the Royal Commission will offer you a full pardon for your crime.
They took him to the Tower... where no-one will be kind enough to feed him arsenic.<eos> Mr. Delaney... His Majesty seeks information.<eos> I really have no taste for this, so perhaps we can conduct this business like gentlemen.<eos> They will allow no easy escape... to death.<eos> Since it is imperative that we keep you alive until after your conviction for treason, the doctor is here to help and assist Mr. Arrow, who will do most of the necessary work.
I need to speak to Carlsbad himself.<eos> I need him to take a message to Thomas Jefferson and the President of the United States.<eos> In Ponta Delgada, Colonnade told me that he would find me an emissary to Thomas Jefferson.<eos> So just tell me what you want to say to Carlsbad, and I'll stitch you up and set you loose.<eos> Interesting knife they used to carve you up.
Oh... dougie.<eos> Here's to you, dougie.<eos> Mr. Jackpots!<eos> Oh. This is the man I told you about.<eos> I wanted to see you again.
We're not winning any hearts and minds there, I can tell you that.<eos> I'm not sure we ever will.<eos> Kandahar's the same, of course.<eos> Can I be completely frank with you, sir?<eos> If I was you, I'd cut Helmand loose.
Sure, Pete. We're not in theater.<eos> You boys earned it.<eos> Sir, have you had a chance to say hello to your wife yet?<eos> You know, she checked in this morning.<eos> I think she's waiting for you in your room.
- Sorry.<eos> - Yes?<eos> Excuse me. I think you are sitting in my seat, sir.<eos> Oh, hey, there.<eos> I'm sorry. Pleased to meet you.
Thank you. Hi.<eos> General.<eos> Tom Howard, sir.<eos> I'm the United States defense attaché here in Paris.<eos> Pleased to meet you.
General Kellermann thought you might like to see the Houses of Parliament on the way, sir.<eos> As I say, a pig.<eos> Does that mean you would or wouldn't like to see the Houses of Parliament?<eos> It means, my dear Superintendent, that I do not have the slightest intention of spending the evening watching a roomful of army officers and their overdressed women guzzling champagne and, between mouthfuls of smoked salmon, telling me the best place to buy Staffordshire china.<eos> Very well, then, I'll take you to your accommodation on Brook Street.
This is two weeks old.<eos> The only way it could have been smuggled into the country was on board the inaugural flight from New York.<eos> So there was a sympathiser on board the plane?<eos> I think that's an SS matter, sir, not police business.<eos> I happen to know that an American reporter from that flight, a Miss Barbara Barga, has been asking questions about you of our press attache.
Fucking puppets, on the other hand, well, it's vulgar.<eos> Even if it were, you'd still have to prove that it has no legal, artistic, or literary value.<eos> I'm not talking about legals.<eos> We're gonna have to talk about the...<eos> To shut down a show simply because it makes you uncomfortable two weeks before it's about to open, I don't think that that's...
No, no, no, no, no. My son always travels with me.<eos> He takes care of everything, all the bills.<eos> I've just got to get back for his christening, and everything will be all right.<eos> You know what?<eos> He'll take care of me. We're gonna get you in First.
Chris, this is Gordon and Emily Greene. Chris.<eos> Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, Chris.<eos> Nice to meet you indeed.<eos> Oh, that's quite a grip.<eos> Thank you. You too, man.
I chose you precisely because we don't have a history.<eos> Now, don't fuck it up.<eos> Fifteen seconds.<eos> People trust you...<eos> for decades have valued you.
Hey, Chief.<eos> A guy just came in and says he needs to talk to you.<eos> Is he Tinfoil Hat or a Kenneth?<eos> Neither.<eos> Knows you from New York.
They got phones in Belgium, yeah? Email?<eos> Mr. Varga.<eos> You're asking me if there are phones in Belgium?<eos> Let me tell you what's gonna happen next.<eos> Three agents from Homeland Security are gonna put handcuffs on you and take you to rikers.
He's talkin' to me.<eos> I can't even write with his pen.<eos> I mean, how can you explain something like that?<eos> I can write with any pen, but with this one I can't even write my name.<eos> Sir, we're gonna need you to leave.
Doc can run an EEG.<eos> Sir? Max will take care of me.<eos> I understand he's your business manager.<eos> No. He's my babysitter.<eos> Okay. I don't like it, but if you want, I can release you AMA...
Maybe you're not much use to me after all.<eos> Mr. Emmons, sorry for the confusion.<eos> Yeah, well, someone better streamline that shit before we get to the White House.<eos> Absolutely, sir.<eos> I'll take you to the president-elect.
Absolutely, sir.<eos> I'll take you to the president-elect.<eos> She's been working all afternoon.<eos> - If she's busy, I can wait. - No. Trust me...<eos> she wants to see you.
I can't say that here in an open hearing, sir.<eos> You saved me.<eos> Yes.<eos> Why?<eos> I was just starting to worry about you.
I just heard from Carter.<eos> The exchange took place, the girl is safe, but, sir, there-there was gunfire and Rebecca was hit.<eos> How-How bad, Mullins? How bad?<eos> It's serious, but there's an ambulance on the way and they'll go to the nearest hospital, St. Catherine's.<eos> We're gonna send a car for you.
The sooner they know, the sooner they can pick another candidate.<eos> I'm not dropping out of the race.<eos> We need to talk this through.<eos> Mr. Carter.<eos> Director Mullins is expecting you.
- Mm-hmm. For what possible...<eos> I'm...<eos> I beg your pardon, but do you believe this?<eos> I read it in a newspaper.<eos> Mr. Guthrie will see you now.
Their intent is to cause terror and destruction until civilization simply ceases to function.<eos> The threat will not...<eos> The defense of civilization is not your responsibility, sir!<eos> Your duty is to restore stable profits to Nassau.<eos> And the men charged to follow you to that end are already questioning their trust in you.
This is politics.<eos> And politics is war.<eos> Which is why we feel that additional security precautions must be taken.<eos> This is Fred Kimafi. He's our new security advisor.<eos> - It's a pleasure to meet you. - Hello.
Splendid. Splendid. Yeah.<eos> So, I thought, erm, we'd treat ourselves to a little drop.<eos> The '61.<eos> I'm honoured.<eos> Well, If I was really honouring you, I would have brought up the '45, but... perhaps when I know you better.
- Leave Oxford? - Why not?<eos> Fresh start.<eos> You've no family local. As I understand it, there's nothing to keep you here.<eos> Scotch before lunch?<eos> I thought you said it gave you guts-ache?
How bad?<eos> Her body was found at a house out by Binsey this morning.<eos> She'd been drowned.<eos> You didn't send her there?<eos> She resigned yesterday morning, just after you left.
So we'll give this a go, then?<eos> Partner?<eos> We'll give it a go.<eos> Welcome to the Kings Motel.<eos> What brings you to town?
I'm Vanessa.<eos> I'm your greatgreatgranddaughter.<eos> How can I possibly be related to you?<eos> I've never met you before in my life.<eos> But I've met you in my life.
"Congratulations..."<eos> Congratulations, Governor.<eos> You ran a great campaign.<eos> I believe it is time that we unite the country...<eos> And I am ready to support you in any way I can.
I'm saying you need to look at all of the possibilities before you walk into a war zone.<eos> I wasn't sure you'd come.<eos> Sometimes a man has to surrender to fate.<eos> See what it has in store for him.<eos> We'll need to put you under. No, no, no.
You're free to go.<eos> Not till you tell me what you've put in me.<eos> You feel an unease, do you?<eos> I'd venture that's what's always been in you since birth.<eos> Your soul. I just put the hardware into you. You're the thing that runs it.
I've shown you his face!<eos> Now, calm down.<eos> You should know that we have Mr. Ness' accomplice, Andrew Nelson, in custody, thanks to your brother,<eos> Once we saw your e-mail, we interrogated him.<eos> He's fully disclosed 21-Void's conspiracy to frame you for the murder of Harlan Gaines and bury your identity by giving you a new one: Kaniel Outis.
What?<eos> That's it, you two.<eos> Come back tomorrow.<eos> We'll all still be here.<eos> Mr. Hampton, what exactly is it you do for the Middleton Legal Clinic?
Heart Enterprises. Please hold.<eos> Heart Enterprises. Please hold.<eos> Whom did you say they were going to replace?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Mr. Skuttle, they're ready for you.
Use it for things like fighting for the school, which you're doing, so...<eos> Where do you think I learned that?<eos> From you.<eos> Listen, if you tell anyone I said this, I'll totally deny it, but... you're my hero, Callie.<eos> I know you.
This is harassment.<eos> You know, now that you mention it, I do seem to remember that.<eos> I also remember you saying that you didn't know anything about Martha Johnson's death.<eos> But I have a picture here... that contradicts that.<eos> Should we be looking at you as a suspect,
Whose fault is that?<eos> You know everything that happened with Nick is because of you.<eos> You're the reason, he... he stalked me, and he broke into my house.<eos> You're the reason he could have hurt everyone in this school!<eos> And you're the reason he almost killed himself.
As it is, I'm not comfortable covering up the circumstances surrounding the death of Detective Malone.<eos> So maybe if Susan Williams--<eos> Mister--Mr.<eos> Mayor! - There's a shooter in the building.<eos> Wait-- we need to get you to a secure locat--
Your boss doesn't seem to have an I.D., record, somehow even a name.<eos> You got all those, Mr. Moon, record especially.<eos> Lawyer.<eos> Didn't catch that.<eos> You're probably asking yourself about now how it came to pass that two country-fried police even found you at that motel for a crime committed over... count 'em... Two state lines.
I don't know...<eos> Since fax machines. And this fax gave us your precise location,<eos> GPS coordinates, make, model, mileage, even VIN number of your Caddy.<eos> So, much as I'd get accolades if we collar you two for the bank bullshit, it's nowhere near as big or as interesting as what is suggested by the details.<eos> Now, you help me unpack those, I may just help get you out of here.
Know her?<eos> Of course.<eos> When I saw these numbers come in, I thought who better to help us capitalize on this than Margaret Hearst?<eos> The whole city... no, the whole country... watches her show.<eos> She can take you to a whole new level.
The whole city... no, the whole country... watches her show.<eos> She can take you to a whole new level.<eos> Solidify your legacy on a national scale.<eos> "National scale"?<eos> She's in my office, and she is dying to meet you.
They're gonna bring him to me.<eos> You know how many crooked politicians there are in this city?<eos> This riddle could be for anyone.<eos> Oh, my gosh, these are delicious.<eos> All the same, Mr. Mayor, we'd like to move you to a safe house immediately.
I was raped, Leah.<eos> - Mum.<eos> - I'm sorry, sweetheart.<eos> Oh, the news statement was approved.<eos> Just waiting for the word from you to release.
! Why would I do that?<eos> I don't know, but we'll need to see your computer.<eos> - And your phone.<eos> - Why?<eos> Because an account registered to you was used to send the messages.
Well, unfortunately, it's the only explanation investigators are willing to give until they know more.<eos> I will make the announcement.<eos> Sir, facing the press with only preliminary theories is like dropping blood in the water.<eos> And the timing alone is gonna raise questions.<eos> Somebody just tried to kill you, and now the Vice President gets murdered by his wife?
We don't need to dwell on the burglary or the assault that you suffered.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I appreciate that.<eos> What I would like to hear about is this tape.<eos> What compelled you to make it?
Great.<eos> Put him through.<eos> Mr. Gatwood?<eos> Hi. Kim Wexler.<eos> Listen, I've been reviewing your documents, and I thought I might've had to refer you to a colleague, but... I think I may have a solution to your problem myself.
We'll look for Tom.<eos> You need to talk to a lawyer.<eos> - Tom Keen got to you.<eos> - Mrs. Hargrave.<eos> He convinced you to release my husband.
I'm gonna head to court to meet Mr. Henderson.<eos> Mr. Henderson.<eos> I'm Josh Segal.<eos> - I'll be representing you pre-trial.<eos> We're gonna get you out of here as soon as we can.
- You've been named as... - Yeah, I...<eos> I didn't do it.<eos> As someone who knows who did.<eos> And we know that you didn't do it. But we know that you distributed pills in the past.<eos> And there is enough testimony in here... to expel you.
Give me her name, and we'll let you slide with work duty and probation.<eos> Really? Wow.<eos> You... you would do that for me?<eos> That's... that's amazing.<eos> Or we can expel you.
"One if by land.<eos> Two if by sea."<eos> Our wonderful country began with that.<eos> Give it a rest, would you?<eos> Yeah, sure, I'll just leave you with the merchandise.
He knows what's in my heart.<eos> Do you think I'm going to burn in hell for ever and ever?<eos> - No. - Sometimes I wish she was dead.<eos> I wish she was dead and that someone would come and take me away from... Mummy and... .. all of it.<eos> I love you.
- No. - Sometimes I wish she was dead.<eos> I wish she was dead and that someone would come and take me away from... Mummy and... .. all of it.<eos> I love you.<eos> That's what I really came to say.<eos> I love you.
You have nothing to be afraid of.<eos> Unless you have.<eos> What you take in with you is what you find in there.<eos> You must have seen some terrible things.<eos> It's all waiting for you.
You're welcome.<eos> - Hi. Good morning.<eos> - Mr. Byrde.<eos> Hi. What's this?<eos> - Good to see you, sir. - Yeah, good to see you.
My apologies.<eos> If our simulations were correct it should start working in half an hour.<eos> Three down.<eos> Going for the next one.<eos> Nice to see you again, Mr. Redfield.
A robbery. Attempted car jacking.<eos> Since the last murder. How long?<eos> More than a year.<eos> Where's the family?<eos> I'll take you.
- You take it.<eos> - Got it. LAPD.<eos> Xavier Moreno?<eos> Sí, señor.<eos> I wanted to ask you a question about this photograph.
It sucks having to drive all the way out here again just to ask the same question twice, but here goes... where were you the night that Noah Solloway was attacked?<eos> - I already told you.<eos> - Your home, right.<eos> Except you didn't tell us, your wife did.<eos> Why do we have a picture of you at a tollbooth right after the George Washington Bridge, the evening of the stabbing?
She's a child.<eos> I think I'm more attractive to women now than when I was 25.<eos> What?<eos> You are the most powerful man in the world.<eos> These women are not hot for you. They're hot for your office. Your power.
Don't worry. You'll have every opportunity.<eos> Yeah, I'm not worried. This isn't about me.<eos> It's about me?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> You are the president. It is always about you!
Hey, everybody, did I miss roll call?<eos> You know, if you're planning to escape, Lieutenant, I suggest losing the entourage.<eos> Harlee is missing.<eos> Probably figured the DNA results would be conclusive and decided to run, but we will find her.<eos> For now, I'm gonna have to detain you, Lieutenant.
Your Ladyship.<eos> What can I do for you?<eos> How long is it since your wife died?<eos> Ten years.<eos> I was surprised when my husband appointed you.
Your husband loves you very much.<eos> - Don't patronise me. - You're right.<eos> I apologise.<eos> But don't ask me to pick sides, Lady Hamilton, because you won't win.<eos> I wish I respected you. But I can't.
I also know that you ordered the Lobster de la Manche.<eos> - Are you trying to blackmail me?<eos> - No, Mr. Briggs.<eos> I'm trying to impress you.<eos> I like you.
We are running short as it is. Hey, hey, hey.<eos> You may run this hotel, but you do not run this kitchen.<eos> Do you think this is the only problem I have today, chef? Because it is not.<eos> Not even close.<eos> So I am warning you, today is not the day to test me.
I see no reason to change that.<eos> Freddie...<eos> Freddie, your father would not have tolerated my behaviour.<eos> I am not my father, Mr. Garland.<eos> Now, I don't know what secrets you had on him or indeed what secrets he had on you, but rest assured my mother will do all she can to bring you down.
I'm even suspicious that maybe you don't really need those glasses to see.<eos> I do.<eos> I think you see pretty clearly.<eos> But those are all the suspicions that I'm prepared to share with you today in your professional capacity.<eos> Were you aware that the U. S. Attorney was pursuing charges against you in connection with a firearms disturbance by one of your employees?
Since the divorce.<eos> - And it's voluntary, you said?<eos> - Oh, yes. I don't get paid.<eos> But my mother was a patient here, rest her soul, and they were so good to her, I just wanted to do something.<eos> Well, I'll leave you to it.
11-year-old girl at Long Hampton Hospital, died in your care.<eos> - I was cleared of any involvement.<eos> - From the testimony of Sister MacMahon.<eos> Insulin overdose, wasn't it?<eos> Administered by you.
And give you motive.<eos> Well, I can't wait to hear what that might be.<eos> You were running for mayor.<eos> You wanted to present a happy family.<eos> The woman you were having an affair with threatens to blackmail you, endanger your political ambitions.
Actually, it is a problem. Wu...<eos> This is not right.<eos> I really don't care what you think, sergeant.<eos> I want your resignation, and I want you off the premises.<eos> Or if you'd like, we can escort you out.
As I was saying to Miss Penvenen, you'll not find a kindlier man than Sir Hugh.<eos> He is generosity itself!<eos> It would be impossible to exist on so paltry a sum!<eos> Doubtless God will then guide your steps towards some amiable young heiress.<eos> Shall I put you down for 30 guineas?
- Donation?<eos> - Yes, sir, see what your kind contribution has purchased.<eos> Grain. A whole shipful!<eos> Now bein' sold at half the market price to those most needy in the district.<eos> Shall I put you down for 70 guineas next time?
Please call me back, okay? Please try me.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I just saw your truck.<eos> It's not looking too good.<eos> I'm happy to give you a ride back to Largo.
Helicopter?<eos> I know nothing about helicopters.<eos> Or arizona, for that matter.<eos> Sir, on your property, we found gps beacons. Used to track down bales of pot.<eos> And two guys from arizona named you as their supplier.
- First names, then?<eos> I might have met her once or twice.<eos> I think Eddie Thurston cancelled that contract because he found out his missus had been playing away.<eos> Now have a little peek at these.<eos> Purchase orders signed by you and countersigned by Laura Thurston.
- We've found a connection between you and Nathan Weaver, that lad who was murdered, and not just to do with working here.<eos> He's been staying up at China Farm.<eos> - What? - Mm!<eos> You send him packing with a flea in his ear.<eos> Did he find something to tie you to Laura Thurston's murder?
So you picked up that wrench and went after him.<eos> Murdered your brother to save your own skin.<eos> But then how were you to know that that shot you put into Laura Thurston... that didn't actually kill her?<eos> Mr Thurston.<eos> We're here to inform you that a Mr Joe Connell has testified to accidentally shooting your wife.
But we decided that you'd stay and get a full workup.<eos> - You decided that.<eos> - But, Ms. Holloway...<eos> I'm not sure I even believe all this toxic whatever business.<eos> And even if I did, would it be me believing you?
This is too much. I only had $200.<eos> Yeah, she just felt terrible about the whole thing.<eos> She wanted to buy you dinner.<eos> Is that really what happened?<eos> Dr. Latham, I'm sorry that I brought you out here.
Keep me alive till my wife gets here.<eos> I wanna say goodbye.<eos> We'll do everything we can.<eos> Mr. Winter, your airways are starting to swell.<eos> We need to intubate you, and put you on a ventilator.
He's my patient.<eos> I will.<eos> Mr. Winter...<eos> As you know, your condition is going to continue to deteriorate.<eos> I'm sorry, but the hospital is in an emergency situation, and I've just been informed that I need to disconnect you from this ventilator.
Dr. Charles thought you were dead.<eos> Well, maybe I finally got through to him.<eos> Think he'll see me now?<eos> Mr. Kellogg...<eos> I am so grateful that you're still alive, and that I get to treat you.
- Shut your mouth.<eos> - Dr. Charles...<eos> - Maybe I should just go.<eos> - No, no, no, no.<eos> I'm so sorry, but I gotta put you on a 72-hour psychiatric hold...
My doc's got me on some pills.<eos> Okay, well, he should've told you not to jump in a frozen river.<eos> The shock is probably what tipped you over the edge.<eos> Everybody's a Monday morning quarterback.<eos> I don't know what that means, but I do know that we need to assess the extent of your coronary artery disease, so I want to send you up to the cath lab.
Apparently, I am unwelcome at S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters, so she's all on her own.<eos> This is unprecedented technology at play here.<eos> I need to keep an eye on her.<eos> The slightest miscalculation could reveal her true nature.<eos> I have confidence in you, doctor.
That's just how you're built. [Breathing heavily] Aah!<eos> Radcliffe: Aida?<eos> I need to go out for a bit.<eos> There's a situation to which I must attend.<eos> - Shall I drive you?
The entire area is sealed off, but, no, I can't rule out Daisy Johnson's involvement.<eos> Tommy?<eos> It's been playing on every channel.<eos> Sir, any truth to reports that Director Jeffrey. Mace's body has, in fact, been found?<eos> I have no new information about that, but I can assure you, the manhunt for the members within S.H.I.E.L.D. who remain at large is still our top priority.
Hang in there, boo boo.<eos> I'll let you know what Anderson says.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Hi, um, it's Spencer Strasmore.<eos> Yes, we've been expecting you, Mr. Strasmore.
No interview, no application, no quid pro quo, which means this case is far from over.<eos> - You have got to be kidding me.<eos> You're gonna give up your chance to be a lawyer for some miners you didn't even know existed before last week?<eos> - Well, I know they exist now.<eos> And I know they're dying because of you.
You were willing to settle for a hundred million before.<eos> This is your chance to do the right thing and clear your conscience at the same time.<eos> - Sounds to me like a chance to clear yours.<eos> This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer, Mr. Ross.<eos> And whether you take it or not, I don't ever expect to see you here again.
He wants to talk to you.<eos> I can't hear him.<eos> Hello, Julia.<eos> How wonderful it is to see you again.<eos> I'm afraid I don't recall meeting you.
Sit.<eos> I wasn't expecting to see anybody out here.<eos> It's quiet out here?<eos> Hi there, I'm Joe.<eos> Nice to meet you.
Yes, it's her.<eos> That's Julie-Ann.<eos> It's all right, Mr Collins.<eos> It's all right.<eos> I've got you.
Come in.<eos> - He's been drinking, I can smell it.<eos> - You go to bed. It's just work.<eos> Sorry, Jane.<eos> - Did Gibbs send you over here?
What... What is it called, when you can't be arrested for something?<eos> Immunity.<eos> - Will I get that?<eos> - No.<eos> But, providing you admit your part in the bank job and stand as a prosecution witness, we can put you into protective custody.
It's not bad.<eos> Listen, Georgie, I got some thoughts on the criminal justice system...<eos> This is last of them.<eos> You should be back to a fair fight now.<eos> Your troops are waiting for you outside, General Washington.
Mail call, Mr. Corben.<eos> Not interested.<eos> Mr. Corben, will you tell the court how you know Lillian Luthor?<eos> She's the doctor who saved my life.<eos> By turning you into a weaponized cyborg?
But an alien who was under our protection, who had been given amnesty, was taken against his will and we were his only hope.<eos> And what if things hadn't turned out your way?<eos> It's my job to ensure that they do.<eos> I made a decision and I accept the consequences.<eos> Director J'onzz, I will let you know when I decide what those consequences will be.
Man's tie is a window into his soul.<eos> We just ran a piece on it.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> So, uh, what does my tie say about me?<eos> It says you're a dedicated civil servant with the bank account to prove it.
Can I ask where you were yesterday, between 6:00 and 8:00pm?<eos> - Yesterday?<eos> - Mm.<eos> - That's when he died?<eos> - It's just so we can rule you out.
I was moving product.<eos> Much cooler.<eos> You mind?<eos> We know the killer had large feet.<eos> Maybe we can cross you off the list of suspects.
To raise money for a business venture.<eos> One that hit big, I might add.<eos> I found that deal, by the way.<eos> I almost got rich. But you didn't.<eos> You went to jail. And two weeks after you get out, the man who profited off your incarceration winds up dead.
Open wide.<eos> So Mitch went to jail, and you and Topher struck it rich.<eos> What then? I couldn't understand why I wasn't happy, so I spent my money.<eos> Hoping things, material possessions, hallucinogenics, would bring me peace.<eos> They didn't. So after you spent all your money, Topher got you into all this?
I respect that, but this ain't no freebie.<eos> We need your help.<eos> You punched me. You took me hostage.<eos> Why would I ever, ever help you?<eos> Okay, let me catch you up.
If you say no to this now, it will all be for nothing.<eos> Not to mention, you are gonna piss off a lot of people.<eos> The women in here... and the guys out here.<eos> And their weaponry is a hell of a lot more punishing than anything a CO wears on his belt.<eos> What you see out there... is a shit ton of people who are also angry at you.
But the terrorists who killed Jim Miller.<eos> Right. Uh, well...<eos> All I know is what they said in their list of demands.<eos> And they believed I would be elected president.<eos> But really, why? Why you?
You didn't let me finish the job.<eos> Why?<eos> Do you really want me to answer that question, Will?<eos> -Because I'm not sure you do.<eos> Because they knew they could take advantage of you.
If you let Wallace out, I promise he will never be back in here again.<eos> Parole is about second chances, right?<eos> I'm asking you to give me a second chance to be a better brother.<eos> Thank you, Detective.<eos> We'll notify you once we've made our decision.
And Jaquan still needs that transplant, if you're willing to give it.<eos> Yes.<eos> It's all just luck, isn't it... life, death, sickness, health?<eos> Mr. Beaumont, Jaquan's out of surgery.<eos> He's asking for you.
I can't wait.<eos> From one to ten, what do you think is your threshold for pain?<eos> - I'm really not into that kind of stuff.<eos> You'd be surprised.<eos> Shall I put you down for five?
- I was asking Mr. Byrde.<eos> Unfortunately, my client list is full.<eos> - I'm sorry to hear that.<eos> Thank you for coming in, though.<eos> Yeah, business is very busy right now, but I... I so appreciate you coming in and it was a pleasure to meet you.
Take your eye off the ball for a hot second...<eos> My wife had to go to the emergency room last year, too.<eos> Middle of the night.<eos> Appendix burst.<eos> I'll get you home as fast as possible.
His ex moved to Virginia.<eos> She's with the FBI.<eos> But I wasn't mad at Cheryl.<eos> Actually relieved to be done living a lie.<eos> Still, your desk puts you in the perfect spot to doctor Cheryl's yogurt during the hubbub, just after the fire alarm went off.
A sales call.<eos> So, you weren't in the kitchen stealing food?<eos> No.<eos> I guess you stopped doing that after Cheryl complained so much about her food being stolen that HR installed a kitchen security cam.<eos> The one that caught you in flagrante yogurt-o.
Orrin Bach for Robert Axelrod.<eos> Are you ready?<eos> Rock and roll.<eos> Let's go on the record.<eos> You assert that Mr. Rhoades harassed you...
Sometimes I laugh myself to sleep at night just thinking about you ripping the place apart.<eos> Hey, Chuck. You know, I never think about it.<eos> But then, of course, I'm not alone at night.<eos> Let's go back on the record.<eos> You assert that Mr. Rhoades harassed you.
It was me.<eos> Found some loose change in the cushions.<eos> Is this going to happen or...<eos> Back on the record.<eos> You assert that Mr. Rhoades harassed you.
You're saying that your damages can be presumed from Mr. Rhoades' actions?<eos> Right.<eos> Right.<eos> Legally, we call these mental or emotional damages.<eos> So... are you saying Chuck hurt you mentally, or are you saying he hurt you emotionally?
- Mr. Jeremy dukane?<eos> - Yah, that's me.<eos> - We need to talk.<eos> - You called me yesterday, didn't you?<eos> - Yes, I was trying to warn you.
Where am I?<eos> What in God's name is this?<eos> Order!<eos> Captain Ichabod Crane.<eos> The jurors of our sovereign lord present that you did commit certain crimes of cowardice, thoughtlessness, and abdication of your sacred duties as a Witness.
I threw away some chewing gum, and it was laying right...<eos> Right there in a... A trash barrel.<eos> Your heart seems to be in the right place, Mr. Williams, but this story, to be honest, sounds like BS.<eos> I'm telling you, it isn't mine.<eos> Then the last thing we want is someone blaming you when they find their gun missing.
My laptop was stolen by a client.<eos> Can you tell me who?<eos> Gave me a backstopped alias. Came to me for three months. Worked his way into my inner sanctum.<eos> You think it's an attack against me?<eos> You or one of my more prominent clients.
- Tha's the father.<eos> - Is it her?<eos> - Mr Hinkin...<eos> - Let me see!<eos> - I'll have to stop you there, sir.
Go there a lot, do you?<eos> - It's good for running.<eos> - Is that what you were doing?<eos> - What else would I be doing?<eos> - We'd like to interview you down the station.
However, there are those in the occult community who claim that J Street actually exists.<eos> In fact, some even say that J Street was meant to be a trap for any supernatural threat to the seat of government.<eos> Well.<eos> Your knowledge of the supernatural certainly is... extensive.<eos> Mr. Dreyfuss, the board was expecting you a half hour ago.
I believe she's going willingly to marry a man she's never met.<eos> Sawm's broken her spirit.<eos> And there's only one thing you can do to stop her.<eos> Say what you did.<eos> Senator, this is not about you or Sawm or your career.
And she never loved me.<eos> But I wouldn't let her take my daughter.<eos> So the best thing for Michelle was to think her mother was dead.<eos> Everything I did, I... I did for them.<eos> Senator, it's time for you speech.
I got B.P. at 136/92, heart rate 114, normal sinus rhythm, SPO2 at 98%.<eos> 1... 2... 3.<eos> Type and cross six units, two large-bore I.V.s wide-open.<eos> And get portable X-ray in here.<eos> Mr. President, we're gonna roll you over for a moment if that's okay.
So we'll have to invoke the 25th Amendment.<eos> Okay, how do we do that?<eos> We'll notify the Speaker of the House and the president pro tem of the Senate through a signed and written statement that you'll be temporarily vacating the office.<eos> And Peter MacLeish will be acting president.<eos> I'll set up a call with you and the V.P. immediately, sir.
And right now, the president needs a legal advisor who's above reproach.<eos> What you're asking is just a little above my pay grade.<eos> Well, it's above all of our pay grades.<eos> What we're talking about is completely unprecedented.<eos> But the president needs counsel, and I might have already told him that we can count on you.
That's it.<eos> Go 'Cause if you fail to do that, you're not only gonna destroy us...<eos> FBI!<eos> Freeze! Don't move!<eos> Vice President MacLeish, I'm arresting you for perjury in front of the United States Congress.
I can't tell you how special it is to finally meet you face-to-face.<eos> And I want you to know that I am open to hearing any advice that you have to offer.<eos> Well... first piece of advice my predecessor gave me was,<eos> Well, I'll take that under advisement.<eos> All joking aside, I look up to you, sir, and I would love to hear how you think I'm doing so far.
Well, he's from Montana, sir.<eos> Damn it!<eos> I wanted to stay off of these third-rail issues.<eos> And you're gonna have to if you want to keep your first hundred days alive.<eos> Bowman wants to draw you out, make a national impression at your expense.
Well, this afternoon took a turn, didn't it?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Please.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I just wanted to assure you that the trip I took and the bill I co-sponsored were completely unrelated.
Hi. - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hear a storm's coming. - Really?<eos> Yeah, we, um... we haven't watched the weather report in a while.<eos> So what brings you to Driggs?
- You're kidding me.<eos> Unfortunately, no.<eos> I don't have any leverage with him right now.<eos> But you might.<eos> Saldua's an Independent. He might just listen to you.
Then, in the spirit of mutual understanding, I suggest that we move over to the initiative regarding nuclear disarmament.<eos> I'm sorry, Mr. President. But France is not satisfied.<eos> May I remind the new American president that when he initiated a mission to capture Majid Nassar in Algeria, we allowed him to use French airspace.<eos> Spanish radar assets and Italian naval support were also employed.<eos> Now, we must all face the fact that we supported you under what might turn into false pretenses.
Pretty awful, wasn't it?<eos> Well, look, I'll be honest. It was one of my more colorful briefings. But your job is way harder than mine, especially right now.<eos> I appreciate you saying that.<eos> And I appreciate you not asking for more information.<eos> Well, I've known you for a while now, sir. Long enough to know that, uh, when you make a decision, it's for a good reason, and that's good enough for me.
You are are not dying.<eos> Okay. What is that?<eos> Holy cow, look at the size of that thing.<eos> I am a big guy, but jeez.<eos> Look this way. We're getting ready to take you to prep.
But see everybody running around here?<eos> There was a quadruple homicide last night and right now...<eos> I'd like a copy of that report.<eos> We'll send it to you when we finish writing it up.<eos> Yeah. Officer DeVoll here will show you out.
I'm going to the district attorney's tonight, and I'm gonna take the plea.<eos> It's just us now.<eos> There were five of us, and it can't be just me.<eos> Mr. Karev?<eos> He'll see you now.
I... I had an accident.<eos> Jesus, you're bleeding!<eos> Yeah, do you have a... A cell phone I could use?<eos> No, reception's too spotty out here.<eos> I'll... I'll just take you to the hospital.
Oh, please.<eos> Mr. Snyder, tell me you did not come here angling to return to your former post.<eos> Oh, I've had many posts in my career.<eos> "Proxy Governor, Los Angeles" is not one I care to return to.<eos> So the Governor-General sent you here because she wants Alcala removed?
Yeah, you know how in movies and on TV shows the police come back sometimes with follow-up questions?<eos> That's what's happening now.<eos> Can I see that badge again?<eos> Photographic memory, Detective Babineaux.<eos> Can you tell me what kind of relationship you had with your neighbors? Mmm-hmm.
Mr. Castel's.<eos> So, he has the $450,000 that we left in that safe?<eos> He said that we would split it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Mr. Castel has double-crossed you, Mr. Graves.
So, he has the $450,000 that we left in that safe?<eos> He said that we would split it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Mr. Castel has double-crossed you, Mr. Graves.<eos> He used you to get to Jasper.
You're the only that can make this decision.<eos> We understand that.<eos> We wouldn't ask you to do something that you're not comfortable doing.<eos> And if ultimately you don't want to do this, that's fine.<eos> We are here to support you either way.
- When?<eos> It's just us now.<eos> There were five of us, and it can't be just me.<eos> Mr. Karev?<eos> He'll see you now.
Anything more from the chest tube?<eos> Bleeding slowed down. Only 400 cc in the pleurovac.<eos> Yeah, we'll need to stabilize his ribs.<eos> In the O.R. I'll join you.<eos> And before you tell me no, I spent all day rearranging my schedule, thanks to you.
Well, if he is then I'm late, because I'm his surgeon.<eos> Good.<eos> Okay. So, I haven't missed it?<eos> No, you haven't missed it.<eos> I can take you to him.
If you have any more questions, ask them.<eos> No, Your Honor, but I would like an answer to my question.<eos> Mr. AUSA?<eos> Would you like to lean in so you could hear me clearly?<eos> I can hear you just fine.
- No. No.<eos> - Yes!<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> It doesn't matter. I'm your client.<eos> - We're firing you.
My guess is Tarr19 suggested it.<eos> And he and I are supposed to be incognito.<eos> The only two Aryans in a Chinese restaurant.<eos> Unless he's Chinese.<eos> Okay. I'm leaving you and staying hidden.
My new assistant.<eos> You want me to recuse myself?<eos> Yes, Your Honor. Regretfully.<eos> - You don't like me, Counselor?<eos> - No, I love you.
Isn't this just a motion to dismiss?<eos> I'm not sure how I can be conflicted out.<eos> I've shopped at BMI, but that's about it.<eos> And you, sir?<eos> Do I know you?
- No, uh, Marissa, wait.<eos> No... okay.<eos> Tell Adrian I need to talk to him.<eos> Can't seem to get him...<eos> Diane needs a word with you.
We flushed out the system when we reopened.<eos> Then you can expect our filing.<eos> Wait, wait, wait, wait, wai... we did nothing wrong here.<eos> You're welcome to sue Lake Drive, but not us.<eos> No, we will be suing you, personally, Doctor.
Who are you?<eos> Adrian...<eos> Boseman.<eos> He's the head of our firm.<eos> How do you do?
- You have our transcripts?<eos> - I believe I do.<eos> And you know that's proprietary information?<eos> It doesn't say so.<eos> Chumhum could sue you for that.
Are you under the mistaken impression that you only defend people you like?<eos> No, I'm under the mistaken impression I don't defend anyone. I'm a prosecutor.<eos> Yeah, well, when you get this tortious interference nonsense dismissed, you can go back to prosecuting.<eos> Sir.<eos> I have to... apprise you of a conflict of interest.
I spent my whole life fighting, fighting for the dignity that was denied our forebears.<eos> They were treated like this.<eos> I will not be.<eos> That's what he's counting on, this little... pissant.<eos> He is blackmailing you, and he's counting on the fact that you have too much pride to prove that he's a liar.
And we're also aware that Selkirk subsidized this "lawsuit," to embarrass the good reverend.<eos> You're taking money from the alt-right, Mr. Kovac, and you edited the drug dealer from that video.<eos> You know what?<eos> I think we're... we're about done here.<eos> And we are prepared to file a civil suit against you and your client... for extortion!
How are you, Rich?<eos> Do I know you?<eos> I don't think we've officially met, but I know you know Colin Sweeney, and I think he may need you to testify on his behalf.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Come on, man. He was leading you to a party in Arlington Heights... the chemsex party...
Is he gonna be all right?<eos> Well, the attending said it wasn't a heart attack.<eos> How come it felt like one?<eos> Because it might have been a slight arrhythmia, which can indicate weakness, or damage.<eos> That's why they want to take you upstairs for more tests.
- No, sir, it won't.<eos> I'm telling you, it's gonna fit.<eos> - I got it up here fine last flight.<eos> - I'll rephrase<eos> I'm going to gate check your bag for you now, sir.
The one who left you.<eos> Yeah, how's she doing? Where is she now?<eos> You don't get to know that.<eos> You don't get to think about her ever again.<eos> And if you come near her, I will find you and I will kill you.
We won't need one.<eos> I'll place a call to Dixon posing as the manager of the bank.<eos> Mr. Dixon?<eos> Hi, Denise Evans here with Union Interstate.<eos> Unfortunately, I am tasked with notifying you that the Mid-Wilshire branch is closing.
You Beaumont?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hi.<eos> Deputy Commissioner Fletcher.<eos> Nice meeting you.
Let's just... let's see what he has to say.<eos> It's okay.<eos> He intentionally hit me in the ribs.<eos> First of all, awesome office.<eos> I guess it pays to be the smartest man in the world, which is why I've come to you for help.
And we don't know what we're gonna find.<eos> Let's say Atwater didn't tackle that punk.<eos> Let's say he approached him, and said, "Excuse me, sir,<eos> "I saw you selling illegal narcotics on a street corner.<eos> Would you mind very much coming to the station with me, so I can lock you up for the next 30 years?"
- to help you.<eos> - Hello, Claudia!<eos> May I call you Claudia? I'm James Bell.<eos> Uh, James, we are in the middle of an intake...<eos> It's okay. Wow, Mr. Bell, uh, I didn't expect to meet you.
I projected a loss.<eos> All right, Dr. Bull.<eos> You have arrived at Ginny Bretton's house.<eos> Front door's open.<eos> I'll wait here for you.
The algorithm's designed to save as many lives as possible.<eos> So it would swerve into the car with only two passengers?<eos> No.<eos> The car would stay its course.<eos> In order to kill the fewest number of people, your car would run straight into the tree and kill you, and there's nothing you could do about it?
This is most likely the last chance we have to talk.<eos> Anything at all.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Todd, our senior systems engineer.<eos> I'm sorry, but it's my official duty to... escort you off the property...
Yes, well, if you will go thinking for yourself...<eos> What do you want?<eos> I was given strict instructions to keep you at the university.<eos> - Who by?<eos> - You.
I don't understand.<eos> Ears open, mouth closed, stop, listen and learn.<eos> I think we have all the information we need.<eos> Mr. Weckler, you confessed to the murder of Roxanne Greer.<eos> And you were caught blackmailing TV personality Johnny Frost.
Are you saying that if we go in the back, we won't find your secret stash?<eos> For cigars manufactured after 2014.<eos> Yes, it was...<eos> So, you have a choice...<eos> I can shut you down, or...
And I always wanted a big brother.<eos> And when I started working with the Five-0, I finally got one.<eos> Mahalo, Max.<eos> Detective Williams.<eos> This might be a surprise to you, but I always considered you as something of a role model.
I founded this temple.<eos> The Greatest Day teaches us that humility is one of the key pillars in a life of service to our Hosts.<eos> Perhaps beginning your journey anew could set an example for others who have found themselves lost.<eos> Sir, a call just came in from Homeland's anti-terrorism tip line.<eos> They're asking for you specifically.
Fifty cents?<eos> I need a train fare to Halifax.<eos> I promise you'll like it.<eos> Excuse me, sir.<eos> May I interest you in a rousing tale of heroic deeds and acts of bravery?
And she took a real interest in you.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Well, I was... this close to kicking you out of here, and Ellen convinced me you deserved another chance.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> She convinced you?
- Who's that?<eos> - That must be the husband of the woman who does the cooking.<eos> Well, I don't envy you this afternoon, Chief.<eos> Why's that?<eos> You've got two women waiting for you inside.
Whoa, four standing dogs?<eos> No, we're people, sir.<eos> Um, Mr. Gronk? I'm Peter Griffin.<eos> I live in the house behind yours.<eos> We wanted to welcome you to the neighborhood.
This is my Easter clothes.<eos> Whoa, a leprechaun!<eos> Say the thing.<eos> Top of the morning to you, Mr. Gronkowski.<eos> Have you any interest in a pot of gold?
Look familiar?<eos> Commander, what a pleasant surprise.<eos> Hey. Please come in.<eos> Hey, thank you.<eos> Thanks, Max. What brings you around in the neighborhood?
The United Nations Secretary-General.<eos> Awesome.<eos> No, that wasn't a metaphor.<eos> Good, because I really wasn't following it.<eos> Mr President, I'm very pleased to see you.
Me, too.<eos> Deran Cody?<eos> Yeah. Sir.<eos> Brian Mills.<eos> Nice to meet you.
I'm guessing it's not a good thing.<eos> I have to assess the likelihood of you committing acts of it.<eos> When we send inspectors, we don't tell you.<eos> Everything by the book.<eos> Don't give me a reason to turn you down.
First you try to persuade with money... that's the "M."<eos> You have plenty of that.<eos> "I" is for ideology.<eos> I tried to appeal to that, and I failed.<eos> And the "C" is for coercion, but as an ally of Dalton's... not a lot to coerce you with.
- Thank God.<eos> - Hey.<eos> What's happening?<eos> Mr. Hobbs, this is my fiancé, Jareth.<eos> He dropped by because, um, he wanted to meet you.
Miss me, Gibbs?<eos> - Well, I thought Dr. Palmer would've told you by now.<eos> No, he did not.<eos> I-I completely forgot.<eos> I-I remember you were elected, but-but the-the where somehow eluded me.
I promise I will, baby.<eos> Love you. Love you too.<eos> Sprechen sie American?<eos> What's your deal?<eos> They're moving you.
Jenny Bach?<eos> Yeah?<eos> I'm Special Agent Maloof from the FBI,<eos> - And this is...<eos> - I remember you... from Bolivia.
Well, I'm gonna pray now.<eos> Would you care to join me?<eos> I'd like that.<eos> Mr. Foreign Minister.<eos> It is an honor to welcome you into Togo.
Colonel Yularen.<eos> I don't know if you remember me from the academy...<eos> Of course, young Agent Kallus.<eos> I keep tabs on all my star pupils.<eos> What brings you to Lothal?
He used Lyste's cylinder to impersonate and implicate him.<eos> And more importantly, he used the young Jedi's power to gain access to my office and reprogram my droids.<eos> Very skillfully, I might add.<eos> I would never have suspected one of my best students was capable of this betrayal.<eos> And that is why you and so many others have been deceived.
I'd say you were just in time to make your grand entrance.<eos> Well, when all this started, I don't think I imagined myself standing here with you tonight.<eos> -Congratulations, Mr. President. Again.<eos> -Oh, thank you.<eos> Um, should I wait for you? No, no.
-The president is right.<eos> Ma'am?<eos> This is President Underwood.<eos> At this time, we have no idea who's responsible.<eos> Perhaps it's better I patch you into the whole room. One second.
Seems so.<eos> And how did she react to the Yates surveillance? What did she say about that?<eos> She didn't show her feelings to me, sir.<eos> You saved my life.<eos> I'm here for you, sir.
Were you aware of this conversation?<eos> No, sir, I was not.<eos> The source went on.<eos> "I believe the president understood that the Muhammed Kalabi in Tennessee was not a legitimate threat."<eos> Was this conveyed to you in any way?
I'd prefer you tell me that.<eos> Humor me.<eos> You asked for this meeting.<eos> What do you think happened?<eos> I believe Zoe Barnes was investigating a relationship you were having with Rachel Posner.
We were itinerant.<eos> How did you come to be in possession of the Gordon family pin?<eos> I've always had it.<eos> Ever since I was a small child.<eos> Did they say how it was that they stumbled upon you?
- You pushed him, didn't you?<eos> - Of course I didn't.<eos> We found fabric under his fingernails.<eos> Fabric that matches your overcoat.<eos> Did he grab at you as you pushed him from the train?
And you think I had something to do with it?<eos> Did you?<eos> Look, I've, uh, dodged the law, taxes and that, but I'm no murderer.<eos> I hardly went near the place.<eos> There have been reports that you were seen there late at night.
Liars and cheats by all accounts.<eos> No reason to think they'd stop at murder.<eos> - Do they still live there?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> But I'd stay clear if I were you.
- Hey, Doc, he could really use the help, I'll even pay for it.<eos> I'm a pediatric dentist.<eos> This man needs an oral surgeon!<eos> - No, I believe in you! - Sir?<eos> - I believe in you.
I know it was you!<eos> Disgraceful.<eos> More cheating.<eos> I didn't, and I don't cheat, Judge.<eos> And I can have you disbarred.
He ratted out my brother.<eos> You're testifying here today as part of a plea deal.<eos> - Isn't that right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> When the State's Attorney's investigators first questioned you about the shooting of Eric Cates, you pointed the finger at somebody else, didn't ya?
How you doing, Steve? Sorry about Danny.<eos> He... doesn't usually get awkward like this. It's all right.<eos> - It's Jersey. It's Jersey. - Yeah.<eos> Listen, man, it's-it's, um... it's-it's really great to meet you.<eos> I just want you to know I saw you in the Garden.
Yes, he is.<eos> - Does he have an attorney?<eos> - Is he from Chicago?<eos> Officer Stone, does he have a record?<eos> We don't usually get to see you at a bond hearing, Mr. Stone.
Well, if you invest in my company, you could see it more often.<eos> Well, we were hoping you'd invest in us.<eos> I already have a private security firm.<eos> Yeah, but do they have the FBI and CIA on their résumés?<eos> It'll take us just five minutes on your systems to convince you that you need us.
I do.<eos> I think I may even know who's behind them.<eos> I'm Anson Gephardt.<eos> I work for the Defense Intelligence Agency.<eos> I'm here to place you under arrest.
Nobody's watching.<eos> Nobody's listening either.<eos> You can trust me on that because if they were, I probably wouldn't admit to you that you're exactly right about what I've done.<eos> But as I was saying,<eos> I didn't bring you here to kill you.
Apparently, people love the wretched.<eos> Thanks to this thing, I was offered seats directly behind home plate at Fenway.<eos> I passed.<eos> Wow, that patient next door is fat.<eos> I can hear you.
Let's have it.<eos> I still don't understand, why are they checking our guns?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Commander Cabral.<eos> At ease. General Walsh needs to see you, Commander.
The same buyer purchased half the block.<eos> He wanted to build a hew housing development.<eos> I already explained all of this in voir dire.<eos> Why do I have to do it again?<eos> These questions are for your protection, sir, I assure you.
So, it's not just fraud and murder you're accusing me of. I'm also rigging the election?<eos> We think your initial interest in Darren Azoff's murder was purely political, but then it turned out he was killed over a stolen guitar, and you knew that Cosmo had caught the incident, and you knew he was a guitar nut.<eos> You put two and two together.<eos> You also knew that there was a manhunt underway to find whoever had the guitar before a hit man did.<eos> You couldn't let Cosmo live to enter police custody because he could give you up as leverage in a deal.
No.<eos> How is that relevant?<eos> Eighteen months ago, your company was based out of Atlantic City.<eos> That's correct.<eos> And what prompted you to relocate?
You never nominated me before.<eos> Now, I catch you in a lie and all of a sudden you think I deserve it? You do.<eos> Well, I deserved it a year ago.<eos> And the year before that.<eos> Sir, as we've explained to your counsel, the bureau will protect you and your family as long as you cooperate fully.
They want to make it look like Claire killed her enemy, and I'm their Trojan horse.<eos> If that's their plan, you have to let it happen.<eos> - Hey, Chris.<eos> - Sorry, Mr. Booth.<eos> We don't have you in the system for a visit today.
Since today.<eos> Nikolaus, how are you, my friend?<eos> Very well, Mr. Reddington.<eos> Thank you.<eos> If you don't mind, we need to wand you and your man.
How many people have you killed in prison, sir?<eos> None.<eos> So the urge went away.<eos> There aren't any women there.<eos> But this urge... This wave growing and pulling you out to sea...
- Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> All right.<eos> Here you go.<eos> - We got you.
- I had no idea.<eos> - I'm the new CFD legal counsel.<eos> Here to help.<eos> - Eric Hanover.<eos> - Good to meet you, Hanover.
- You okay?<eos> - I'm good.<eos> Hey, Booms.<eos> We were wondering where you were.<eos> I was hoping that you'd quit.
We're guessing that your wife never found out about it either.<eos> The thing is, I asked around at the 15th, and there was a cop there who remembered the incident.<eos> And the way he tells it, you and Booker were real pals.<eos> You felt like you owed Roy.<eos> When he asked you to make up a story about a detective pointing a gun at you, you did.
For the record, I'm showing Dr. Marr a broken compact disc.<eos> Would we find your fingerprints on this?<eos> Swift gave that to my daughter.<eos> I listened to the first song, and it was obscene, so I fired him to protect my little girl.<eos> A phone message has come to our attention. The person who sent it claims to know something that would send you to prison.
Well, he's a powerful man, a man it'd be hard to say no to.<eos> Yeah, well he's never asked me to do nothin' for him but play good.<eos> All right, what about your major sponsors, Pax Car Rentals?<eos> What about 'em?<eos> Did anyone from Pax coerce you or any other player in any way?
Went to a mate's barbecue.<eos> Well, he needed gas.<eos> I certainly didn't burn down any houses.<eos> This isn't helping you, Mr Foster.<eos> The only way you'll help yourself is to cooperate, otherwise I will keep you locked up, indefinitely.
Do you... have something against leaders of the society?<eos> My child was kidnapped, but there was no ransom demanded.<eos> Shouldn't I be checking out anyone who may have grudges against me?<eos> But you can't just go hounding people like that.<eos> What about the people that got hurt because of you?
It's nothing to do with money.<eos> She knows that.<eos> We're Jehovah's.<eos> We don't want any surgeries that require blood transfusions.<eos> It's not about you.
I don't have time for formalities.<eos> - If you brought me on, maybe you would.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - Headhunting isn't cutting it for me, Mr. Specter.<eos> I want back in the game, and since you're the reason I'm out of the game, you should hire me as a full-time in-house consultant.
I-It's pounding.<eos> - He's leaking spinal fluid.<eos> His wing was adhered to the dura.<eos> It tore when you pulled it out.<eos> - Okay, Senator, let's get you lying down. - Make...
Please!<eos> I can't possibly do another print run if the first printing hasn't sold out!<eos> Drifting Emotions is the greatest work by the novelist Shin Michima.<eos> Considering his name value, and data like sales and pre-sales, 3,000 is plenty for first printing.<eos> I'm begging you.
I appreciate it.<eos> Sir, I'm looking forward to seeing how you visualize Mr. Hanaki's novel.<eos> Leave this to me.<eos> I've already put together a system for portraying Mr. Hanaki's world.<eos> I knew I could count on you.
You know why Jesus wasn't born in the West?<eos> Enlighten me, Detective.<eos> Because they couldn't find three wise men or a virgin.<eos> That's enough.<eos> I will pray for you, Detective.
Sorry.<eos> Look here.<eos> Here, sit here.<eos> You'll like this better.<eos> They'll be here for you soon.
I'd like to introduce my fiancée.<eos> Kathy Eriksson, Mr. Chinoy.<eos> But I can assure you, Mr. Chinoy, that my clients are all professional, as professional as anyone that BCCI...<eos> Do you like escargot?<eos> Of course, I can introduce you to my friends whenever you want.
That's because you're the cow who's least proficient in the art of tempting the other sex.<eos> Moo.<eos> Do not mistake my indulgence for a relaxation in discipline!<eos> They must find husbands, Mr. Bennet.<eos> For as you know too well, they shall inherit nothing when you pass.
We'll give you a workstation, some place to go every morning.<eos> And we will produce a video résumé that will set you above the rabble.<eos> But all of that is just preparation for the main event.<eos> Wilheimer has an 85% placement rate, Mr. Davis.<eos> - How do you think we make that number?
You did that on purpose, didn't you?<eos> - Absolutely!<eos> - You did! You did, too.<eos> - Good afternoon, Mr. Buffett.<eos> - Oh, jeez! I am sure you're wondering how I knew that you were in town.
Good afternoon.<eos> Roger Davis here to see James Gentry.<eos> You could sign in.<eos> Sir?<eos> I'm going to need you to exit the building.
Pull her up! No! No, mom!<eos> Nooooo!<eos> Whoa. Whoa. Oh my!<eos> Why did I buy this boat?<eos> Glad to have you back, Mr. President.
What budget problems.<eos> Etienne, We both know the future, investigation, not a matter of accounting matters.<eos> We've supported for 15 years.<eos> I know I can count on you.<eos> I admire you, JYC.
You're Thomas Wolfe?<eos> I'm reading your book. It's a masterpiece.<eos> Is it, now?<eos> Very much.<eos> Look, um, I have some friends who are dying to meet you.
I had served my purpose.<eos> And now, you have served yours. "Thank you and goodbye, Mr. Perkins."<eos> With respect, Mrs. Bernstein... you haven't the slightest notion of my relationship with Tom. - And in view of that...<eos> - He makes you do things... you never thought you'd do. He liberates you.<eos> And just when you have come to depend upon that... he will leave you.
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!<eos> You want to get killed?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Get in the car.<eos> They're waiting for you.
That's the question Spaniards are asking.<eos> His surrender to authorities, unlike what was previously thought, has not calmed the political climate in this country.<eos> ROLDAN NEGOTIATED HIS RETURN THROUGH LIMITED EXTRADITION<eos> It was all a lie.<eos> Minister, sir, they're waiting for you at the press conference.
- Hi. Great to meet you.<eos> - Kenny. Mike. Come.<eos> No, I'm okay. Thank you.<eos> This and the money are in the genes.<eos> How are you? Kenny Wells.
Did we cut the pipe?<eos> I don't know, but I don't think so.<eos> We need to disconnect, Mike, help me get to the bridge.<eos> I'll take you to the bridge.<eos> - I got you.
It's me, Bernie, sir.<eos> Webber. Pick yourself a crew.<eos> Go out there, help them fishermen... secure their boats to the pier.<eos> Oh. Uh, yes, sir.<eos> Sir, I need to ask you a question.
Thank you.<eos> I need a few minutes alone. Captain...<eos> Captain, how do you feel about this being the worst naval disaster in history? - Captain...<eos> This would never happen in Japan.<eos> If the roles were reversed, you would not be called in to testify on anyone's behalf.
Do you stay in this building?<eos> No<eos> Actually, it's been a month since I gave you the CD<eos> I called your office several times, in vain<eos> I'm sorry, I had to surprise you like this
What are you doing here?<eos> We thought...<eos> - Adi sir...?<eos> Big fan, sir!<eos> Love you, sir.
I wouldn't take a dime without his say-so.<eos> You're angry.<eos> Oh, this is bullshit.<eos> Unusual way of making contact with you, Mr. Wolff.<eos> You were recommended by Mansoor Haqqani.
I'm a crook.<eos> He's the chief of police.<eos> That's how it goes, I guess.<eos> No.<eos> He liked you.
Hi. We got cut off.<eos> This is Dr. Paul Schatten.<eos> I know you're listening.<eos> Billy, your sister spoke to me.<eos> She's very concerned about you.
This is Dr. Paul Schatten.<eos> I know you're listening.<eos> Billy, your sister spoke to me.<eos> She's very concerned about you.<eos> I believe there's solid grounds for taking you out of active duty.
I know you're listening.<eos> Billy, your sister spoke to me.<eos> She's very concerned about you.<eos> I believe there's solid grounds for taking you out of active duty.<eos> Now, Kathryn will drive you to the VA hospital right after the game.
Yeah.<eos> How do we start?<eos> We make the house dumb.<eos> Okay, Mr. Regan, the first thing we do is sterilize you and your family.<eos> We need to do all we can to scrub you from the web, reduce your footprint to make you a smaller target.
Okay, what does that mean?<eos> Apparently spied on female co-workers and ex-girlfriends.<eos> - Works as an independent IT tech. Seven, eight companies.<eos> No job lasts more than a couple of months.<eos> Then hired by you.
Anthony has given his statement.<eos> Anthony Ricco... seventeen... young...<eos> I'm talking to him regularly.<eos> All your colleagues know me very well, detective.<eos> So I believe, and I wanna get to know you better myself.
Oh, we don't have unions here.<eos> We have Filipinos.<eos> - Ah, Mr. Clay?<eos> - Yes.<eos> We've been expecting you.
I'm going to the cave.<eos> The primitives didn't have an easy life.<eos> No one has an easy life, Maria.<eos> Visitors.<eos> We weren't expecting you.
Professor.<eos> Ah, it is you.<eos> You're back so soon.<eos> I have no idea who this woman is.<eos> I almost didn't recognize you in that suit.
Give me six men stationed here.<eos> Safeties off.<eos> You're being stupid now, Professor Langdon.<eos> Go, go. Get out of here. Go!<eos> They needed you, but now they've changed their minds.
You're telling me that, for two years you and your organization have been working against me?<eos> That is correct.<eos> To shield Bertrand Zobrist and his research? To hide him, to protect him?<eos> Regrettably, yes.<eos> And that all of my attempts to prevent him from initiating a worldwide pandemic have failed because of you?
Sorry. They can produce a skin rash.<eos> Should fade in a day or so.<eos> All of this was a fake?<eos> I prefer "created reality."<eos> My agents kidnapped you and cleared your memory so we could create a fresh scenario whereby you would be invested in the idea of helping us.
But when Michael Corleone was sitting in the restaurant across from the two men who attempted to kill his father, many argued that he was wrestling with his conscious to whether or not he could kill them in cold blood.<eos> I however believe that the decision were made the night he visited his father. And saw him barely alive in the hospital.<eos> He had no choice, really.<eos> He had to pull the trigger.<eos> And as for you, Mr. Sloane, all you had to do was pull the trigger.
Charlie wouldn't be coming.<eos> Is this about your husband's death?<eos> Porter Wren, is it?<eos> Yes. You must come and have a word with Mr. Hobbs.<eos> He's quite eager to meet you.
I'm a...<eos> I write a column in the paper.<eos> I'm risking my whole career, telling you who I am.<eos> And please, trust me.<eos> I read you all the time.
- Yes. Just one second more.<eos> That's for Sye, idiot.<eos> Is that? I waited.<eos> Mr!<eos> The news says that you have been killed.
- Well, may the best man win, I guess.<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> Hey! Hey, mister!<eos> Hey, fella.<eos> Mr. Kowalski, Mr. Bingley will see you now.
Oh. Sorry, we call them Muggles.<eos> You wiped his memory, right?<eos> The No-Maj with the case?<eos> That's a Section 3-A, Mr. Scamander.<eos> I'm taking you in.
- We got a break-in.<eos> One eyewit, this gentleman here.<eos> Sees male, undetermined race, goes in, comes out, runs down the street, gets into a cab.<eos> Anyone inside?<eos> Waiting on you.
- I'm not sure about that.<eos> - What do you mean, son?<eos> Me hand written's terrible.<eos> Could you write it for me?<eos> I do know you, don't I?
- I know exactly who you are<eos> - You do?<eos> Of course I do.<eos> I've read all of your papers.<eos> It's a pleasure to finally meet you.
I made it quite clear that a vote for me was also a vote for my wife.<eos> They knew what they were voting for.<eos> Did they?<eos> Mr Khama, Sir Alistair Canning wants to be fair about this.<eos> It should reassure you to know that he has appointed the Chief Justice of the High Commission Territory, Sir Walter Harragin, to conduct an enquiry.
There's no money left after the war.<eos> They never gave us money before the war.<eos> We pay the taxes they demand, and we get nothing.<eos> Mr Nash.<eos> What is keeping you here so long?
America is sending funds to Mr Khama, so that he can defend himself against us.<eos> It's... I mean, look at these.<eos> Never has a Labour government been criticised this way by the negro press.<eos> We are on the eve of the election.<eos> I am pleading with you.
- Do you have family? - I have children...<eos> Okay.<eos> If this was your child, if you knew she was lost and in pain... you'd do anything to help, wouldn't you?<eos> I can't prove to you that I'm right.<eos> All I can do is ask you to understand where I'm coming from.
Welcome back.<eos> Just Reacher.<eos> I'm a civilian now.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I'll take you up.
You know each other from back when you were C.O. here?<eos> Nope. Never met.<eos> I'm sorry to give you the bad news, Major.<eos> Ex-Major.<eos> Sir, I wanted to warn you.
Open BA211.<eos> Stand here.<eos> Don't move.<eos> Espin, prisoner transfer.<eos> I'll file for disclosure. They'll turn over whatever evidence they have on you.
Said he was evasive then he disappeared.<eos> This is Leach.<eos> This is Sergeant Greene, your old D.l. Remember me?<eos> Sergeant Greene.<eos> So good to hear from you.
- Open this door!<eos> Good morning, Mr. Moon.<eos> Miss Crawly.<eos> What, uh... What's going on?<eos> You got a lot of animals waiting to see you, Mr. Moon.
Flo, you're upsetting your mama.<eos> Why don't you come on back to earth now?<eos> I'm already right here on earth, Papa.<eos> Henry and I are going off together.<eos> Please, sir. I beg you.
I'll make it up to you<eos> I swear. Your guests will always think of the grand Bhutiani wedding.<eos> They better do.<eos> After all I'm spending a bomb on you.<eos> Only you can.
I know it's boring. But, it enabled me to raise a son.<eos> I'm very proud of what he grew up to be.<eos> His name was Charlie Spencer.<eos> Your murdered him. In Sokovia.<eos> Not that it matters in the least to you.
I'm doing what has to be done ... to save us from something worse.<eos> You keep telling yourself that.<eos> Hate to break up the set.<eos> Hello, Mr. Barnes.<eos> I've been sent by the United Nations to evaluate you.
No, Afghans are the people.<eos> Afghanis is the currency.<eos> That's right. I knew that.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What do you believe your mission to be here?
There is a guy still in the house. So, I... - I killed him.<eos> - Okay. - Fuck. Are you still on the phone?<eos> Yeah, it's the police.<eos> Hang up the fucking phone!<eos> - What're you... - Sir, did you just say...
You too, Louis.<eos> I'll be praying for you, son.<eos> Hey, Louis.<eos> - I'm John.<eos> - Yeah, you were at the church.
Good things.<eos> Sit down, please.<eos> Your husband doesn't speak English?<eos> Only a little.<eos> Your wife has asked if she could bring you to the Ambassador's Ball tomorrow.
When police officers show up to a domestic violence case often men were just taken away without asking what even happened.<eos> It's just presumed that men are the criminals.<eos> I was assaulted several times, and I never got any help.<eos> I went to the police still bleeding a couple of times, and one police officer said... I'll never forget this, he said,<eos> "if she starts hitting you again," you better get out of there fast, because if she just breaks a fingernail trying to hit you, "we'll arrest you."
Right now it's not the state of my health concerns me.<eos> Dead about eight hours.<eos> Say between one and three this morning.<eos> But you didn't call me out here cos she was hit by a car.<eos> No. I called you out because she was hit by the same car... several times.
You couldn't have seen him. No?<eos> Why not?<eos> Cos I was with him at his place till... well... well after the fair closed down.<eos> Maybe Bixby did a deal with Jeannie and Swopes.<eos> Then they double crossed you.
Now, can you sign your signature, like you would on some sort of document or form?<eos> All right. Now, I need you to fill out this questionnaire.<eos> You mean, like a test?<eos> Kinda.<eos> It'll give me a better idea of where you are.
She's not mad.<eos> Don't believe the gossips.<eos> She needs a man in her life.<eos> A husband.<eos> I hardly know you. But you seem the solid type.
I don't even know your name.<eos> I forgot.<eos> You're playing along with it.<eos> They want to be rid of me.<eos> They've bought you off.
My wife sees terror in an orange pip.<eos> Your wife can see worlds where no-one else can see anything of value whatsoever.<eos> Can she really?<eos> And how do you "deduce" that, Mr. Holmes?<eos> She married you.
Security team is on its way.<eos> Hold your position!<eos> We're receiving a hail.<eos> I'll give you credit, Captain.<eos> I underestimated you.
Discovery!<eos> Captain, you there?<eos> - Yes, is everything alright up there?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> We're going to get you out of there, but can't get a clear enough lock to beam you and the others out.
That's what I said.<eos> How is it you find yourself there?<eos> They say a burglary. I say trespassing.<eos> I didn't leave with nothing.<eos> Isn't that because the police apprehended you before you could get out the door with the Fujitsu TV you were carrying?
Mr. Cuatro was 78 years old and on an oxygen tank.<eos> Did you bring the knife with you?<eos> No. Got it from his kitchen.<eos> A five-inch steak knife, according to the police report.<eos> And you were arrested in the same manner on September 20th, 2012, in possession of another steak knife.
No.<eos> Why not, if it was possible she was still alive?<eos> I don't know. I wasn't thinking.<eos> You see why I'm having some trouble here?<eos> You had the presence of mind to run from a crime scene, to remove evidence implicating you in the crime, to operate a motor vehicle without crashing into anything, but you didn't have the presence of mind to dial three numbers on your phone?
Yet, you don't see what I see.<eos> What do you see?<eos> A Ceres for Belters.<eos> Run by Belters.<eos> Run by you?
I guess your men... I think they got all the good stuff.<eos> Why did you go back to Julie Mao's apartment?<eos> I'm gonna come clean.<eos> Embarrassing... But... I really like her shower.<eos> Why do you care so much what happened to this girl?
And that makes me a monster.<eos> There was no scrip to bury her, so I laid her to rest in a beautiful bauxite tunnel that we discovered together.<eos> Do you know it is possible to cry so hard that your tears turn to blood?<eos> And living with this pain, I came to realize that I have millions of brothers and sisters in the Belt.<eos> I even count you among them.
He sees it clearly for the first time.<eos> I see everything I need to see.<eos> Maybe you haven't lost everything yet, huh?<eos> When you do, you will know your way home.<eos> And it will welcome you.
Adam is so stupid. He deserves to be punished.<eos> - What'd he do?<eos> - How many dollars does this cost?<eos> Ah, that's more of a question for... for your mom and dad, right?<eos> I'm asking you.
W... what time is it, Macy?<eos> You scared me.<eos> You were sleeping so deeply.<eos> Um, it's, uh... 6:00.<eos> I'm sorry, I should've woken you earlier. But I didn't dare.
Thank you, Tony.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I have to get up to Manchester.<eos> Nobody told Patrick, right?<eos> No, you had asked for us to wait for you to get here.
- Would you like a coffee?<eos> - No, thank you. Not for me.<eos> - Good morning!<eos> - Morning.<eos> - Good to see you. How are you? - Yes, I'm fine.
You?<eos> I'm fine, yeah.<eos> Mr. Erdmann, Mr. Iliescu.<eos> Iliescu.<eos> Nice to meet you.
Hello?<eos> Yes, may I speak to John Aloysius McCain of 550 Maple Avenue, please?<eos> I'm sorry, sir, but I'm on disability and I can't give you any money.<eos> Oh, that's okay, sir. We're not looking for any donations.<eos> I just wanna get to know you somewhat.
Operation bodyguard was set up a year ago to keep Hitler guessing about the invasion.<eos> Decoys, deception, that sort of thing.<eos> This could cost us the war, captain.<eos> If you see anything in the least suspicious, call us.<eos> We're counting on you.
As I live and breathe.<eos> Hi, Daniel.<eos> Thanks for taking us on such short notice.<eos> Sure thing.<eos> Richard, it's nice to finally meet you in person.
It obviously has something to do with that tree.<eos> Now, come on.<eos> You can talk to us.<eos> We're your town council.<eos> We love you.
Aren't you going to chastise him?<eos> Well, I...<eos> I am very disappointed in you, Mr McMoon.<eos> I do not approve of drinking.<eos> What got into you?
- Music is important.<eos> - It should not be mocked.<eos> - How dare you?<eos> She has done more for the musical life of this city than anyone.<eos> - And that includes you.
When it comes to it, you will beg for one extra minute with your family.<eos> Trust me. Please. Take the radiotherapy.<eos> You can call me at any time...<eos> Hello, Dr Turner.<eos> What you doing here?
Mr Phillips?<eos> How can I help?<eos> Get me into the London, doc, fast as you like.<eos> I will beg, borrow and steal every minute I can get.<eos> We'll take you in as soon as we can.
- Call me Lizzie.<eos> That's what I say to all the blokes.<eos> And I'm not saying anything else to you!<eos> Morning. Sorry to keep you, Fred.<eos> Or maybe I should call you Mr Buckle, since I've asked you in on official business.
- I thought your word was bond.<eos> A former associate of mine was feelin' himself.<eos> He's not feelin' much of anything right now.<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> Pop's death is still on you.
Well, we all can't be as pretty as you. Ain't that the truth.<eos> You got the goods?<eos> You know me.<eos> I always come correct.<eos> It's all piled up in there, just waiting for you.
You a shrink?<eos> I was on the job for 15 years.<eos> I left to become a psychologist.<eos> I'm with the peer assistance program. I'm a volunteer.<eos> Well, how about I volunteer my way out of this chair, tell you to kiss my ass, and talk to my union rep?
Mr. Kalloor, my name is John Barros.<eos> I'm from the Department of Justice.<eos> And I'm hereby serving you with the enclosed complaint<eos> - Really, you have to do this in public? against Deep Dream Corporation for violation of the Sherman Act.<eos> This complaint requires you to preserve all personal and corporate financial records.
- PROCESSING<eos> EXPEDITE<eos> Welcome home, sir.<eos> Thank you,<eos> Sir, we have a secure room for you, right upstairs.
- Get the cars ready!<eos> - Go!<eos> Get the cars ready, right now!<eos> No. Take me to the suite.<eos> Sir, we got to get you out of here. Bourne is on the loose.
- Married yet, Mr Chambers?<eos> - No.<eos> - Got yourself a girl?<eos> - No.<eos> I bet they're flinging themselves at you.
Not to mention an excellent opportunity for you to expand your business on the back of my herculean labors.<eos> A mutually beneficial arrangement.<eos> Sze Yup ships are already docked at your western terminus.<eos> An exclusive shipping contract is merely a pen stroke away.<eos> So, that's what lies ahead for you, is it?
MAY 10TH 1869 All aboard!<eos> TRANSCONTINENTAL RAILROAD BUILT ON BRIBERY AND CORRUPTION<eos> Mr. Bohannon?<eos> Archibald Romans, Senior White House Staff.<eos> I'm here to invite you to President Grant's gala this evening.
Me leaving's the closest thing we got to a happy ending.<eos> Sounds like you've got it all sorted.<eos> Don't go sour on me.<eos> See yourself away.<eos> The President will see you now.
- You're not interested in a Bible sure to be the pride of your family's home library?<eos> As you no doubt know, June, envy is one of the seven deadly sins.<eos> And that is what your friends and neighbors will be guilty of when they see this leather-bound beauty on your bookshelf.<eos> - Sir, this is a private place of business.<eos> I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
- Where's John? - Looking for Esme.<eos> - Right.<eos> Ruben Oliver.<eos> Portrait artist.<eos> I really enjoyed the depiction of you in the dining room.
I've come directly from the battlefield, my orders were to report to the Austrian Emperor himself.<eos> No, no, this is not how we do things here, Your Excellency.<eos> I'll have to have a word with the Minister.<eos> He has asked to see the Emperor.<eos> He will see you now, please, come in.
No, no.<eos> No, I can't.<eos> Just remember what she came to say.<eos> She's at peace.<eos> And she loves you.
Did I not make it clear?<eos> They said if they weren't here by morning prayers then the meeting has been cancelled.<eos> Perhaps Mr Jarvis has been held up at the House of Commons.<eos> Perhaps Admiral Hall's been held up at the House of Lords.<eos> Am I impressing you?
We've been asked to be understanding of our Russian friends by His Majesty, but it has been some time now. And...<eos> - May I ask your name, sir? - Shelby.<eos> Thomas Shelby.<eos> And in the future I'll be dining here quite a bit.<eos> - Then I shall put you on our special list.
- Mr Shelby?<eos> - Yes!<eos> Oh! Your little boy looks so much like you.<eos> Yes. He's a little rascal, isn't he? !<eos> Mr Shelby, would it be too inconvenient to steal you for a moment?
Trust me.<eos> How can I trust you when you're talkin' crazy?<eos> How can I trust you when you've lied to me so many times?<eos> Monsters?<eos> ! I lied to you because it's hard to tell you the truth.
I hear you, brother, but my hands are tied.<eos> Well, mine aren't.<eos> Well, enjoy it, 'cause that's a luxury I don't have.<eos> Detective Gordon.<eos> I was hoping you'd be here.
Hey, Peralta, you made it.<eos> What took you so long, brother?<eos> Okay, seems like he's playing it pretty cool.<eos> Probably more surprised on the inside. Uh-huh.<eos> Sir, Gina and I are worried about you.
But they will definitely have the riches looted from Iraq.<eos> All that money goes to the Swiss Bank.<eos> And your government has asked me to do this for them.<eos> Call Baghdad and let the bus go.<eos> Otherwise your President Mr. Saddam Hussein will hang you like he did Fawad...
Footit and Kananga Duo.<eos> Music, thanks!<eos> Monsieur Kananga?<eos> Monsieur Kananga?<eos> Monsieur Kananga? I'll call you, we're waiting!
You know I cannot refuse you, dear Firmin.<eos> I want to introduce our Othello.<eos> Rafael, this is our troublemaker.<eos> - The fearful, scary Jago.<eos> - Nice to meet you.
The Prince is absolutely right!<eos> The trouble is, though, women don't care for me, society women, that is, I don't seem to have the knack of talking to them.<eos> Believe me, my dear Count, it is not for you to concern yourself.<eos> It is for the young ladies to make themselves pleasing to you now, rather than the other way round, as you can see for yourself.<eos> I will leave you with the Princess Helene.
You know what, I think you want the hospital.<eos> What's happening, Dayshawn?<eos> What's the chatter amongst the other workers, huh?<eos> Who you all pulling for in the principal race?<eos> Oh, you know, they, uh, they pulling for you.
Freddie Hamid owns me.<eos> Before this all started, I saw you sailing at the Cairo Yacht Club.<eos> Did you?<eos> Well, that's only when I'm invited. Which isn't often, to be honest.<eos> Who invites you?
Never mind.<eos> His loss.<eos> Hello, Mr Roper.<eos> The trucks are loaded.<eos> Everything is waiting for you.
Mr Roper.<eos> The same.<eos> Not a painting.<eos> How can I help you?<eos> These gentlemen are here to place you under arrest.
- Are we taking the boat?<eos> - Yes, we are, sir. You might even drive, if you're lucky.<eos> Hello. - Nice to see you. - You, too.<eos> - Hi. - Jorge, how are you?<eos> Mr Roper, how are you?
Good trip, sir?<eos> Very good, jasper, thank you, yes.<eos> May I introduce Mr Andrew Birch, Director of Tradepass.<eos> We will be facilitating Mr Birch's sale.<eos> Pleasure to meet you, Mr Birch.
Ms. Rutledge just explained to me that you've been treated for substance abuse.<eos> She said this whole thing was probably an accident.<eos> That's true.<eos> I know a suicide when I see one, Mr. Thorn.<eos> We're keeping you for 72-hour observation.
Now that's ridiculous.<eos> Well, he said this room has access through a secret doorway in a bookshelf.<eos> It's a panic room.<eos> I never use it.<eos> I suppose I should warn you.
Good evening.<eos> Evening.<eos> What?<eos> I believe I have the pleasure of speaking with Count Bezukhov?<eos> I have heard about the misfortune that has befallen you, sir, and I am very sorry for it.
Do tell your father that I shall do my very best to make my contribution to the militia.<eos> I've been very lax.<eos> Do you know, I moved the family to the country to save money, but somehow, I've been doing more entertaining here than I ever did in Moscow - hunts, theatricals, dinners, musicians, endless guests coming to stay...<eos> Well, I shan't be any further burden to you...<eos> Oh, no, no, no, my dear fellow, I didn't mean you.
He's had enough of me.<eos> Are you the Prince Andrei that Pierre Bezukhov talks about?<eos> He is my greatest friend.<eos> He loves you very dearly.<eos> I think you're his hero.
'Scuse me, Mr. Noonan.<eos> I'm headed to a technology conference in Seattle.<eos> - No more questions.<eos> - We don't have any questions.<eos> We're arresting you... for the murders of Nate Orton and Bud Mayer.
Okay, check with the doorman, see if anyone suspicious has been hanging around.<eos> All right.<eos> Mason loves Victorian Gardens.<eos> We were just there last weekend, the three of us.<eos> Mr. Allen, I have to ask you, can you think of anyone who would want to hurt you?
Look, it's simple.<eos> You're making a transaction. You give him what he wants. He gives us what we want.<eos> My son is not some business transaction, Lieutenant.<eos> I know it's impossible, but you gotta try to take away the emotion because that's what it is to him.<eos> Okay? We'll be watching you, making sure you and Mason are safe.
How come?<eos> Well, I was up for tenure, again, and I didn't get it, again.<eos> Aerospace positions are difficult to come by.<eos> Norah was on the selection committee, and I was upset.<eos> Why, she didn't vote for you?
How much time you got?<eos> I was devastated about what happened to Norah.<eos> She was a good friend.<eos> Even though she rejected your tenure?<eos> Sounds like she had some kind of pull on you.
- There he is.<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> - Here he comes.<eos> - Excuse me, Clay.<eos> Clay, do you feel vindicated now that they let you out?
Good work ethic, strong character, good leader.<eos> Well, he was a tremendous influence.<eos> Yeah, he's a good man.<eos> And he really seems to be enjoying retirement, too.<eos> Unfortunately, I think he gave you some bad intel.
Mind if I join you?<eos> Hi. What can I get you?<eos> Coffee... black.<eos> Coming right up.<eos> He really did a number on you.
Coffee... black.<eos> Coming right up.<eos> He really did a number on you.<eos> I know you?<eos> The young man who did that to you. He's my nephew...
Can we hear it from Mr. Ehrmantraut?<eos> The gun wasn't Salamanca's.<eos> That's all I can tell you.<eos> You told us it was.<eos> You said Salamanca pulled it and pointed it at you.
- Mr. McGill. Just wanted to have a laugh at my expense?<eos> I called him.<eos> What?<eos> I called Jimmy earlier, before I picked you up. He showed up when he did because I called him.<eos> I was worried about you, and I just... I called him.
Ah, but now you've quite recovered. Mostly.<eos> I still have a little difficulty getting out of bed on cold mornings. I understand the weather here in Paris is to be quite warm all week.<eos> You need to have no concern for my health, then.<eos> Delighted to hear it.<eos> Tell us, Captain... why are you here?
I know his mind.<eos> He took that cache with the express purpose of compelling us to commit your force to a battlefield of his choosing.<eos> Your force is factored into his thinking.<eos> He has planned for it.<eos> And I assure you, if you allow him to dictate the terms of battle, you court a disastrous outcome.
We're taking you to a safe house.<eos> Once we've completed our investigation, you'll be given the opportunity to testify in exchange for immunity.<eos> That's not gonna happen.<eos> Good choice, Detective.<eos> Your mother looks able-bodied enough to visit you in prison.
I'm gonna have you fax those files to the office...<eos> James Nava?<eos> James Nava?<eos> I'm sorry, I'm David Simkins, DA's Ethics Office.<eos> I'm investigating the voracity of a complaint against you for inappropriate conduct.
Let me be happy.<eos> Get out.<eos> You... are banished from my presence.<eos> I-I feel... strangely free.<eos> I will no longer wait on you and your whore.
Shall we go in and see her?<eos> What's going on outside?<eos> Is that all for Rose?<eos> Don't worry about that now.<eos> Come on, I'll take you in.
I can't tell you that at the moment, I genuinely don't know the answer.<eos> It's something you can discuss with your solicitor when you're a little stronger.<eos> A solicitor?<eos> Why would I need a solicitor?<eos> We're only here to look after you medically, Paul. All right?
The one real eye witness is his sister, Annie Brawley.<eos> After the attack and before you were arrested you went to see her in hospital.<eos> I did?<eos> Why? She was grieving the death of her brother.<eos> You were employed by the Alice Monroe Fund to offer her support, counselling.
On that basis, I feel I need to raise the issue of competence as to whether Mr Spector is fit to stand trial.<eos> Mr Healy, let me stop you there. The concerns you have raised are noted, but you know as well as I do that it's not a matter on which this court can adjudicate.<eos> Mr Spector, do you understand that your case must be sent to Crown Court?<eos> Yes.<eos> Then you will be held on remand in hospital until arrangements can be made to transfer you to a secure psychiatric clinic where more tests can be done to determine the nature of your mental disability.'
I don't think you told me your name.<eos> I asked you your name.<eos> It's, er...<eos> Are you feeling OK?<eos> Well, it was nice to meet you.
I didn't use them and it wasn't an experiment.<eos> I wouldn't use that sort of terminology.<eos> What we're talking about is a fully authorised and legitimate medical trial.<eos> You knew them.<eos> No. I headed up a company, Greenfern, which provided research facilities of the nature you have described.
In the Republican party, he can help you out in California...<eos> Yeah. I want you to meet Senator Davidson.<eos> Yes. I appreciate you coming to every fundraiser.<eos> Yeah, I'll be right back.<eos> I expect to see you next time. Yes.
Yes. I appreciate you coming to every fundraiser.<eos> Yeah, I'll be right back.<eos> I expect to see you next time. Yes.<eos> That would be great.<eos> Yes, nice to see you.
You busted me.<eos> I'm incontinent. Write it up.<eos> I hope I'm wrong, but one might think you're sick of this town.<eos> You from the Post?<eos> How did you get in?
I grabbed him straight away, said, "What the hell you do that for?"<eos> What did he say?<eos> Nothing.<eos> He just looked at me.<eos> Looked at you how?
I don't want to end up like them.<eos> Please.<eos> Please!<eos> Where did you learn that?<eos> I watched you.
Intriguing message.<eos> It's what Sanjay wrote on his hand.<eos> Yes, before his unfortunate act of self-destruction.<eos> Very dramatic, but meaningless.<eos> I've read everything you published, Dr. Goldman.
They found your car over in a dried-out arroyo at Topping.<eos> - What about my wife and daughter?<eos> - Still no news. They weren't in the car.<eos> We're turning the case over to Lieutenant Andes.<eos> He wants to know if he can pick you up in a few minutes.
You took on the responsibility of such a big man. Wowwie.<eos> But a thousand curses to the informer that got Urja caught.<eos> He's a dog, he's a rascal...<eos> - Stop it. How much are you going to abuse him?<eos> You act like I am abusing you.
And I can also see that Alex is more than just one of your agents.<eos> She's family.<eos> And you want to protect her at all costs.<eos> I get that.<eos> But if you pull her out before she has a chance to save her sister, she will never look at you the same way again.
I'm assuming he's made you some promises.<eos> Vis a vis the department. More funding.<eos> Pie in the sky. Chief of Police?<eos> Nothing's set in stone.<eos> I'm glad to hear that. The West Side mad at you?
And after they take care of the bouncers, the bartenders, and the DJs, they get to keep what's left?<eos> Look, nobody put a gun to their head and said "You get on that pole, bitch."<eos> They leave this place every single night with cash stuffed up their coozies.<eos> You don't like it, you can report it to the IRS.<eos> Billy, why don't you show the detective to his car?
- I gave you her number.<eos> I've been busy.<eos> Your mother told her a story a few days before she died.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> She'd been to visit you at the youth home.
- I wouldn't know.<eos> - But you know who he is.<eos> I worked with him on some major cases when I was in Narcotics.<eos> 21 tons of coke in a warehouse in '92.<eos> That had to have given you a step or two up the department ladder.
That's impossible.<eos> Unless the meteorites contained a mutative element, like the particle accelerator that caused your powers.<eos> But without evidence, you're asking us to take you at your word?<eos> It's not my word. It's theirs.<eos> But you still don't remember me, do you? We knew you in our past lives.
I assume this ship has a, uh, autopilot or something?<eos> - You assume correctly.<eos> - Great. In that case, I'ma need you to take me back to 2016.<eos> See, me being here, it's all a big mistake.<eos> Captain Hunter told me you'd try to do this, and he also told me not to listen to anything you say.
I hyper-extended it. - I thought he fuckin' got suspended.<eos> - Hey!<eos> I fuckin' hear you, numb-nuts. - Sorry, that's what I heard.<eos> - What'd you hear?<eos> - I heard that you got suspended.
Your daughter? What's her name?<eos> Sarah.<eos> Her name's Sarah.<eos> To Sarah.<eos> I recognize you.
I'm down.<eos> I'm fucked.<eos> You don't need meds.<eos> You're just listening to the wrong voice.<eos> You're tuned into the one yelling at you over the loudspeaker that you're fucking stupid and your performance blows.
I love you, dad.<eos> But if you walk into my office and try to use your influence again, you are gonna walk out of here in handcuffs.<eos> Mr. wolkows--<eos> skip.<eos> I've known you since I was a boy.
- Still. William Still.<eos> I've heard of you.<eos> About what you do.<eos> Through discreet circles, I hope.<eos> What I do is why I've sought you and your horses out this evening.
You think you're ready for that after what happened?<eos> - I told you that...<eos> - I told you ignorance still has consequences.<eos> Sooner you find the money, sooner we can talk.<eos> Can I interest you in the wonders of Tupperware?
You okay?<eos> What the fuck?<eos> I'm calling the goddamn cops.<eos> Please don't, please.<eos> Okay, he thought you were someone else. It was a misunderstanding.
Morning, Deborah.<eos> Morning. I'm, uh, Richard Evans. How do you do?<eos> Hello.<eos> How are you? Richard is, uh, Professor of Modern History at Cambridge.<eos> Yes, I know. I know. I asked for you specifically.
To their families, their friends.<eos> Anthony, I... I promised that their voice would be heard. I promised.<eos> Well, then you'd better go back out there and break your promise.<eos> Professor Van Pelt.<eos> May I first of all welcome you to our country and say what a great pleasure I had in reading your book on Auschwitz.
This poor little child has been taught a racist ditty by her racist and perverted father.<eos> Have you ever read Edward Lear?<eos> Hilaire Belloc?<eos> They haven't brought a libel action, Mr. Irving. You have.<eos> You sued because you said that we had called you a racist and an extremist.
My mom. Of course.<eos> We had no way of knowing.<eos> It was so...<eos> She was expecting them. She'd have made a scene...<eos> But they'd have loved to see you.
Trying to improve the ventilation in the ward, miss Hastings.<eos> On whose authority?<eos> I saw a light, maybe it was a tunnel, and, uh, uh, there was a figure there...<eos> Beseeching me.<eos> It was probably Dr. Foster begging you to go away.
Well, my wife makes a go of it.<eos> Of course.<eos> Of course, she does.<eos> Dr. foster?<eos> Dr. summers would see you now.
Apartment 34, Alberto Street, Windale.<eos> Do they pose an immediate physical threat?<eos> No, no immediate threat.<eos> And what is your ID number? 1688145.<eos> I have you up. - Was there anything else?
Sorry, son. These trucks aren't toys.<eos> Sounds like the last chief bent the rules.<eos> Are you sure this kid's okay?<eos> Hey, wait a second.<eos> I know you.
He... punched her and... knocked her down.<eos> Kicked her in the stomach and the face, all over.<eos> It was the most violent thing I've ever seen.<eos> And after that, all the others did what they were told to do, and so did I.<eos> We can protect you.
Every other agency... they have an application to fill out.<eos> - A personality test.<eos> - No need.<eos> You have so much potential.<eos> No one sees what a resource you are, do they?
So the only thing I can control is this.<eos> Sir, she blew her brains out again.<eos> And she didn't lead us any closer to the Machine's location.<eos> It appears we still have a few wrinkles to iron out.<eos> Good news-- she waited an extra hour before she shot you.
Is that a path that we're on?<eos> I suppose I may have made that impossible.<eos> Even if you could tell me, it's probably too late.<eos> Double shot, and... a cappuccino.<eos> Glad to see you back.
- This will only take a moment.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> Pardon, monsieur, I'm running very late.<eos> Sorry, Minister.<eos> A liaison will be down shortly to escort you upstairs.
That I want to see you all the time.<eos> And talk to her. -No.<eos> Continue to spin.<eos> The fear when you will, the fear when you go.<eos> -I beg you.
Please.<eos> Are you a feminist?<eos> Uh, I like symmetry.<eos> You were at the concert.<eos> I saw you.
- "More" or "less"?<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> Shit, I knocked over a kid.<eos> No, it's not a kid.<eos> Sorry, I didn't see you!
No, Luchio.<eos> Not tonight.<eos> I did warn you.<eos> Be careful what you say, counsellor.<eos> I could sue you for slander.
- Women aren't allowed.<eos> - Well, there's that, too.<eos> That pin belonged to one of the men that tried to kill me last night, and Dottie Underwood tried to steal one just like it back in New York.<eos> Who is Dottie Underwood?<eos> She kidnapped you.
Towards what?<eos> We're miles from any sort of structure.<eos> A car will come. We haven't seen a soul in an hour.<eos> Mr. Jarvis, allow me to clarify that in the future, your opinion on how we proceed is neither wanted nor required.<eos> I should've left you at home, but I trusted that you would know how to behave... A mistake I won't make again.
Let me be the judge of that.<eos> Miss Frost? Someone here to see you.<eos> Mr. Masters.<eos> One of his boys.<eos> I know you.
And it's a smoke-free zone anyway.<eos> I'm in the middle of something, okay?<eos> Can you just give me a minute?<eos> If you don't move your car, I'm going to have it towed.<eos> I'm going to have you towed.
Hello, there, sir.<eos> How's your day going?<eos> Everything's good, thank you.<eos> Is there anything I can do to make your stay here more pleasant?<eos> Perhaps sign you up for a round of golf?
- We have to go faster. - Move it! Move it!<eos> Move it!<eos> I'm looking for Gestapo Inspector Dietrich.<eos> Inspector Dietrich, I'm Brandt.<eos> I was expecting you yesterday.
- I know.<eos> Mieke, I wanted to apologize for how I was the first time we met.<eos> Met?<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> I wanted you.
Excuse me.<eos> I've been waiting for an hour, and I need to drive back to Nashville for a job I have tonight.<eos> - How much longer?<eos> - Mr. Barkley?<eos> Nice to see you again.
As I explained yesterday,<eos> Juliette doesn't feel as though she...<eos> I heard you before about her not feeling safe, and I'm aware of what she's up against.<eos> But she needs to hear how I'm feeling.<eos> Look, I'm afraid I have to ask you to... Like a liar.
Why was he taking pictures?<eos> Was he paparazzi?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Come on. Let's go.<eos> Mr. Weaver is expecting you.
Yes.<eos> Like a sister.<eos> History is right, of course, to judge him on moral grounds.<eos> But, as a man of science... I can't help but admire him.<eos> The duty nurse will escort you to our isolation wing.
I must not be feeling myself today.<eos> There is a terrible darkness here.<eos> What is this place?<eos> I'm sorry. I don't understand.<eos> I thought I saw you with a patient.
There is no cure!<eos> Don't you see?<eos> He's the one that is making you sick!<eos> There's nothing wrong with you people!<eos> I wouldn't do that, if I were you.
Smith will tell us.<eos> But it doesn't matter a whole damn. We're gonna breach anyway. This is pretty much the worst idea I've ever heard.<eos> It's gonna be a bloodbath in there.<eos> You're playing with the big boys now, Detective. This is how we roll.<eos> Whatever happens in there, is on you.
- Thanks.<eos> - Hap collins?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - Jack divit, fbi.<eos> Sheriff's office got a statement from you.
If they put that in front of me tomorrow, I don't think I can sign it.<eos> It's gonna be okay.<eos> They're coming up.<eos> You've been briefed by your lawyers, Mr. Axelrod.<eos> We'll try to get you out of here as soon as possible.
The police out East may have come into possession of a video of the incident taking on someone's phone, which purports to show you striking Mr. Layner.<eos> - That should cut our way.<eos> - I'm not so sure.<eos> - How bad is it?<eos> - Well, I haven't seen it yet, but I've been told it's damning enough that they're planning on arresting you as early as tomorrow.
So, how is Thailand treating you, Mr. James?<eos> Like a king, so far.<eos> I have a few questions for you.<eos> You bring security this time or what?<eos> No need, I assure you.
Could you find me a cup of coffee?<eos> - This is Constable Stratton.<eos> Arthur Conan Doyle.<eos> A pleasure.<eos> Pleased to meet you.
Let's be frank, Matthew.<eos> What matters here is only how things appear.<eos> And for me, this appears to be a disaster.<eos> This incident will go public, and I will have to explain how not one, not two, but three members of my government were murdered.<eos> To be fair... two of them were trying to kill you... sir.
To be fair... two of them were trying to kill you... sir.<eos> Remind me ... who is this man?<eos> Advisor to our ATCU.<eos> he tracks enhanced threats.<eos> Threats like your very own Minister of Defense, General Androvich, who I believe was trying to assassinate you.
Mr. President!<eos> - Mr. Chase?<eos> - Who are you?<eos> United States Secret Service.<eos> We're not after you, Mr. Chase. We're after whoever put you up to it.
- We could use some fresh blood.<eos> That I agree with, but LeAnn?<eos> I mean, there's no guarantee that we can control her.<eos> Yeah, but if she can convince Claire to change her mind, that's all I need.<eos> Yes. They're ready for you in the Situation Room, sir.
- Yes.<eos> - I'm sorry. What is this?<eos> Only, my officer tracked down some of your guests.<eos> And they reckon your husband did leave the party.<eos> Mr. Brian Hallam. I'm arresting you on suspicion for the murder of Martin Neilson.
Probably just to warn him about those thugs.<eos> The lampers. Right.<eos> Course, he knows you of old, doesn't he?<eos> - We used to work together.<eos> - What, did he look out for you?
- We used to work together.<eos> - What, did he look out for you?<eos> Then and now?<eos> He sticks by people.<eos> So, did he find you, after he left the party?
You've got nothing.<eos> Course, it would've been a shock, seeing him there.<eos> But nothing compared to the shock of Alex's betrayal.<eos> It was you she was after.<eos> She was laying a trap... for you.
It was you she was after.<eos> She was laying a trap... for you.<eos> And you walked right into it.<eos> I was just helping her with her studies.<eos> And all the while she was plotting to expose who you are.
Yes, sir.<eos> I wouldn't worry about me, sir.<eos> You should worry about yourself.<eos> Because Daisy saw me shoot her?<eos> Because I'd kill you if you did.
This reluctant recluse The one lost in himself<eos> Playing a warrior by day The one lost in himself<eos> Got your salary?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> They are waiting for you.
Feels good, doesn't it?<eos> It feels like shit.<eos> Where is Ruby?<eos> I want to see my daughter right now.<eos> I'm taking you to my boss... Quinn.
- Damn it. - How do I get these things off?<eos> - Where's my daughter?<eos> Tell me now, or I call the police.<eos> Okay, calm down, Dr. Carter.<eos> I'll take you to her right away, okay?
Yeah.<eos> Me, neither.<eos> Detective, detective, that's my employee. Ms. Goldberg...<eos> You are legally not allowed to talk to her without a lawyer present. You know that, detective.<eos> - We'll get you out of here.
From there, you can get to the jump ship.<eos> - Hey, mick, this is a strange kind of hug.<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> - I got something to do.<eos> - Mr. Savage, I need to get you to the helicopter.
No!<eos> Sir, I'm a little bit confused here.<eos> - Did you do what they asked? - Yes.<eos> Of course, I did.<eos> So why did they beat you up so badly?
It's closed.<eos> I found an expert.<eos> She was very excited with those pictures I sent her.<eos> Hi. We're outside.<eos> I have something very interesting to show you, detective Clayton.
Could you describe him?<eos> Yes.<eos> That's right, I think I... I hit my-my head... quite hard when I... close...<eos> Oh shit!<eos> I feel really stupid doing that to you.
You have to believe me!<eos> No, I don't, Mr Clayton.<eos> I don't know what happened with you and Barbara Haleton last night.<eos> Nor do I know what went through your mind the moments before you pulled that trigger.<eos> Or that the GHB you'd both taken had pushed you into an altered state.
And, I hoped, perhaps yourself.<eos> So you thought that I would now travel to London, to Whitechapel, and challenge the care and rigour with which my friend has prosecuted this case?<eos> Forgive me, Miss Goren, but that is a leap of faith based on no other logic but your own.<eos> I will not do it.<eos> No, it is you who must forgive me. I'm in your home, and I've raised you to anger.
Forgive me, Mr. Dove.<eos> These spies, it is their business to imagine threat where none yet exists, but what we have here in our deadroom is a sight more real than the fantasies he summons up of Indian cuckoos in our Queen's nest.<eos> Mr. Dove, surely you see the greater scale of our priorities here.<eos> Mr. Hafeez will be remanded to Inspector Drake's care.<eos> And if I have you overruled?
Take him.<eos> This hatred of my empire and Queen, these were my son's true beliefs?<eos> They were, Major Al-Qadir.<eos> I cannot believe he came to them - without you. - Hmm.<eos> And which beliefs did he come to because of you?
He's the colonial secretary, and you're the colonial.<eos> You are to him no more than a trained circus pony.<eos> Best you understand that.<eos> Here is the lesson, Major.<eos> They dress you in this costume and puff you full of a confected self-importance, the purpose of which is only this... that we here in this country may slowly bleed your country dry, whilst your back is turned, parading in our honour.
There is a wake we must attend.<eos> - Is Roy Teague here?<eos> - No, sir.<eos> He could not bear the sight and bolted.<eos> What trouble brings you here, young Mr. Dove?
Get this bitch on a leash!<eos> Psycho!<eos> Psycho. You wanna go?<eos> Go back to the ward, you psycho bitch!<eos> What do you think people will say about you when you die?
There's somebody laughing, there's somebody being laughed at.<eos> Right.<eos> Look, whatever. Really.<eos> I mean, this whole high school thing's just a blip.<eos> I'm not gonna remember any of you.
The Germans took him to a prison camp, but no one knows where he is.<eos> I'm sorry, Miss.<eos> This is Warsaw calling.<eos> This is Warsaw calling.<eos> Citizens of Warsaw, we urge you to leave at once.
-They're here, they're here.<eos> -Okay. -Be careful, dear.<eos> I'm... I'm being careful.<eos> I'm being careful. -Hi. -Hey, sweetie.<eos> -Good to see you. -Oh!
Frank's what?<eos> Frank's an idiot. You know, Frank never went to college.<eos> I heard Frank comparing women's vaginas to automobiles earlier today.<eos> Whether Frank is refined enough for your taste is irrelevant. He's good at his job.<eos> If something were to happen to me, he'd fill you guys in on all the details you need to know.
I don't know what that says about me.<eos> That's the tragedy of it.<eos> Reporter: Mr. Madoff, are you scared you're gonna lose your home?<eos> Mr. Madoff, what do you have to say to all of the people...<eos> - Stephanie: What the hell is wrong with you? !
You must have heard of this sociopath.<eos> Yes, I have.<eos> He's my husband.<eos> Well, I'm sure he's nice once you get to know him.<eos> I'll be leaving you two alone then.
Do you have any idea who that man is?<eos> For a man who's so popular, I'm surprised I don't.<eos> Goosefat Bill.<eos> I know who he is. He got that moniker 'cause he keeps slipping out from the bars you keep putting him behind.<eos> He was found in this establishment, and that doesn't look good for you.
For it is in giving that we receive.<eos> It is in pardoning...<eos> - Bang.<eos> - Bang.<eos> Bang, may the blessings of all those that you love and those who love you...
Yes I can hear you.<eos> Send me your location.<eos> Sending the beacon now.<eos> Tee, do you have a visual?<eos> Ok, I see you.
He was fast.<eos> You should have seen him in those last moments.<eos> I'm sorry. But listen, you kidnapped us.<eos> And that's what motivated that.<eos> So, like that is on you.
Emily, come on. I didn't mean that.<eos> It's fine.<eos> I know how you see me.<eos> Shit, shit, shit, shit.<eos> Shit, shit, shit! There's some very bad men looking for you. They have guns.
Now I'm getting the confidence.<eos> Oh, okay. No, I can't do that.<eos> I just got excited.<eos> Don't move!<eos> I will kill you.
Desrt air?<eos> Good genes?<eos> I don't know.<eos> They don't want you to know the truth.<eos> No, that fork-tongued speaker of calumny shall rassle you down...
I've given birth to the devil.<eos> Rama Kushna says this will break down the walls between the planes. Even the afterlife will be affected.<eos> Yeah, it's dodgy, all right.<eos> I'll look into it.<eos> Meanwhile, the House will drop you wherever you'd like.
A single human among your teeming masses.<eos> I only know John Constantine because he enrages me.<eos> Faust lives in an observatory which is invisible.<eos> It's a place where dark magic would infect the earth below it.<eos> I will take you there so you are no longer here.
If you stole, do not steal from the Valley Town.<eos> Yes, I have two great friends.<eos> You made me a partner in the crime of theft.<eos> We did not ask you to do anything.<eos> I brought you here.
Do not touch my car.<eos> You will not force us to walk!<eos> I will certainly challenge you.<eos> Lord, you will be great bank robbers.<eos> They catch you stealing from Valle Town!
- Yes.<eos> It's your problem now.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Good luck, may you enjoy Every moment of your time together.<eos> We love you.
"Fergus needs things to be simpler.<eos> "I know how embarrassed he is about me.<eos> "I could not be the man that you both need.<eos> "I've tried and tried and tried for 20 years, and everything I try is another disaster.<eos> "I love you.
Thank you, miss.<eos> We are eternally grateful.<eos> Why do you care about him so much?<eos> We've looked after him all his life.<eos> But he's cursed you somehow. Why?
Maybe we can start growing together without it.<eos> I'd like that.<eos> Thank you for letting me see Missy.<eos> It was entirely my pleasure.<eos> I can't begin to describe the joy it gave me to see you two together.
It... they're probably not going to show anyway, so...<eos> - Hola, chicas!<eos> - How's it going? - Hola.<eos> Hola. - Hey, how are you?<eos> I'm so glad you came.
And we were friends, remember?<eos> - What happened was fucked up, I admit...<eos> - You don't get to talk about it!<eos> Fuck you, Ant!<eos> Fuck all of you!
Most women get sick of Stan three, maybe four weeks after they start fucking.<eos> His first wife Barbara left him to go live in an ashram in India. She lost it.<eos> You'd think it would make him more humble' but no.<eos> Yeah, well, anyway, we haven't heard from her in a while.<eos> The only reason I'm telling you this is, as a warning, in case you're falling for him.
Anyone can do that job.<eos> I'll give you $50,000.<eos> How did you find me, huh?<eos> 'Cause you are fucking up my life, lady!<eos> The people after you, they're on my ass now!
And I'm up all night thinking about what I'm gonna say to the superintendent at 2:00.<eos> You know, I don't have anything planned.<eos> I know what I'm gonna say at my meeting.<eos> I'm gonna be like,<eos> "Fuck you for trying to make us re-interview for our jobs again!"
Let me bottom-line this for you.<eos> Someone's going down for this.<eos> I'm firing one of you two today.<eos> Tell you what, how about we'll go one better.<eos> How about I fire you both?
Don't you get it?<eos> Brother, it's Eid.<eos> We'll also make some money.<eos> You'll have our blessings.<eos> If we slaughter you along with the goats, we'll be blessed.
We will kill you.<eos> Kill me?<eos> How?<eos> There's five of us.<eos> Yes, I know! I've been waiting for you.
When these Zords formed, dinosaurs reigned supreme.<eos> They will be an extension of you.<eos> And their power... is all but limitless.<eos> But you're not ready for this power.<eos> When you morph, your armor will make you one with the Zords.
The leader?<eos> Oh, hello, Red.<eos> You're not entirely disappointing.<eos> Oh, look at you. Trying to figure out my plan. I'll just tell you.<eos> Yellow has led you to your deaths.
So, uh, how much do we tell him?<eos> Just enough to get him to say yes.<eos> Now there's a man worth talking to.<eos> An uncharted island?<eos> Let me list all the ways you're gonna die.
An uncharted island?<eos> Let me list all the ways you're gonna die.<eos> Rain, heat, mud, disease carrying flies and mosquitoes.<eos> Sure, you could load up on the Atabrine for the Malaria, but what about the other bacteria?<eos> And we haven't even started on the things that want to eat you alive.
It's more of, like, a plane than a boat, really.<eos> Let's call it a "Ploat."<eos> We're on a Ploat.<eos> We need their location, slivko.<eos> Send up a flare so we can find you.
- Please, roll up your sleeves.<eos> Come on, roll up.<eos> This is obscene.<eos> All I'm doing, Faith, dear is getting something off my chest, without getting it on yours.<eos> What you're about to hear me say may horrify you, but you will forget it.
- She's literally taken over the asylum, we have more to worry about than her choice of colour scheme.<eos> Barely dry.<eos> Recent.<eos> And it's for our benefit.<eos> As a motivator to your continued cooperation, I'm now reconnecting you.
I don't think he gets it!<eos> Buckle! Buckle!<eos> Put on your seat belt!<eos> right?<eos> But we're not gonna hurt you.
I'm sorry, I need to go. I'm late.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Hello.<eos> Kim, it's Elliot.<eos> Elliot... God, I was just thinking about you guys.
Don't think it.<eos> Don't think it.<eos> Good news for you. Maybe.<eos> Kim Hines wrote a suicide note, taking responsibility for her roommate and for the deaths of you and the other two living at your house.<eos> So, I guess she was planning on killing you, too.
This way.<eos> Fuckin' pansies.<eos> _<eos> Detective Macklay handled the case when it came in.<eos> He'll brief you on background.
You move about as fast as a pig... swimming in gravy.<eos> I can't.<eos> If I say anything, I'll just end up crying.<eos> This was a fail, guys.<eos> These exercises are about trying to teach you how to perform in the real world, so... do better.
- Hey, do the smart thing, Danny.<eos> Strike Gao down while you have the element of surprise.<eos> Leave Radovan.<eos> Look out for your own.<eos> I started this program... to teach you not just how to defend yourselves, but how to prepare for your futures.
This isn't just your fight, Danny.<eos> They came at me in my home.<eos> They attacked my hospital.<eos> They killed my friend.<eos> I don't want you guys in any more danger.
But you wouldn't let the hospice nurse do it.<eos> You were so thin... and fragile.<eos> You were like parchment.<eos> I was afraid they might break you.<eos> And sometimes... sometimes I'd wake up... and I'd see you there, asleep in the chair... and you'd be looking just like you were when you were kids.
And in that darkness, I'd pray.<eos> I would plead to the universe that if I... if I ever had a second chance, I'd do anything.<eos> I would do anything, I'd pay any price, to keep you away.<eos> Keep you away from that pain and that heartache.<eos> I wanted to protect you from suffering, because you'd endured so much already.
What?<eos> Death?<eos> It was like when I was a kid... coming home from school through the snow, and... and then I'd be standing on the porch, freezing, and on the other side was comfort.<eos> But this time... This time when I tried the handle, the door wouldn't open.<eos> And I could hear you.
Look, I'll get there as soon as I can.<eos> Hey, no excuses.<eos> This is important, Danny.<eos> I haven't been very reliable, I know.<eos> But you'll be glad to hear that Gao is finally out of the way.
Just a few more.<eos> - I'll just do them one at a time, okay?<eos> - Oh, it really hurts.<eos> Why don't you do something to take your mind off of it?<eos> Like, explain to me where the hell you and Colleen went after I saw you get taken away at the dojo by some mystery man.
- Let me get her to a hospital.<eos> Danny said he's coming. He will.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Two minutes to go.<eos> Maybe Danny's figured, with all of you out of the way, he'll be in charge of Rand.
did you find out what evidence the DEA has against Danny?<eos> who are you?<eos> Colleen Wing. wonderful.<eos> Another fugitive from the law.<eos> The DEA considers both of you armed and dangerous.
Any news from Joy?<eos> No.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Ward.<eos> I was told I'd find you here.
Okay, I don't know how much of this I can take.<eos> - This sounds insane.<eos> - And so does being bulletproof.<eos> The two of you trust me, so please listen when I say... you're on the same side.<eos> Now, we're gonna leave you two alone, and you're gonna talk.
- Let's talk about it never.<eos> Unless you wanna tell me how a blind man moves the way you do.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - I have pictures, asshole.<eos> Rand Enterprises has put together a case to take you down.
What's wrong?<eos> Have I gotten in your head the same way he did long ago?<eos> What about the ones you still love?<eos> What will become of them once you are gone?<eos> - Who else must die because of you?
I don't think I have to answer to you.<eos> But considering the events of the last few hours, I thought it best to keep her isolated.<eos> Because you think we will kill her?<eos> No.<eos> I think she might kill you if she even senses your disloyalty.
Suit yourself.<eos> We've had no luck identifying the bodies we found in the warehouse with you.<eos> And though you two have colorful histories, I have reminded the NYPD - we have no evidence...<eos> ...to suggest that you were responsible.<eos> Now, I trust Detective Knight, and she says that, although you're being tight-lipped, the best way to proceed is to treat you as witnesses and not suspects.
At least... the rent is cheap?<eos> Your thoughts, next.<eos> Trish Talk.<eos> Thanks for listening.<eos> You're sure you don't want anyone to know what you did?
Believe me, you're doing fine.<eos> You're good, all right?<eos> Hello, I'm Eamon Bailey.<eos> Thank you, thank you.<eos> So glad to see you all here.
Look! We match.<eos> - Yeah. - We sure do. - These are great.<eos> - Very stylish.<eos> I love you guys. I'll see you later.<eos> - Love you!
- It's not you.<eos> - Oh, we know that.<eos> - It's us, we...<eos> - Yeah, it's us. ...just need you to understand that.<eos> - I love you.
- You make them safer.<eos> - Mae-Mae, at least wait a bit.<eos> I'm the only one who can do this.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I love you.
When he's done uptown, you think he's gonna stop at 14th Street?<eos> We'll just have to take care of ourselves.<eos> Oh, yeah? For how long?<eos> And how much blood?<eos> You kill Santino, the Camorra, and the High Table come for you.
I'm nothing.<eos> He'll get tired of me.<eos> Master sleeps in your bed.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I saw you.
Mia.<eos> I wanna thank you all for coming here this evening.<eos> I was expecting a small family gathering.<eos> Thanks, Mia.<eos> But I'm happy that you're all here because I have an announcement to make.
Come on, up.<eos> Up.<eos> Dustie, dead ahead.<eos> Lunch break.<eos> You're here because you shouldn't be here.
Great.<eos> Bugs.<eos> Welcome, strangers.<eos> May the light be with you.<eos> How may we enlighten you?
Diana, I know this confusing...<eos> - It is not confusing! It's unthinkable!<eos> - Who is this woman?<eos> She is with me, she is with us.<eos> I'm not.. I am not with you!
- Sir Patrick. - No...<eos> No...!<eos> Gentlemen, sit.<eos> Ms. Prince, sit..<eos> I assume you are here planning something... that's going to get you either court martial or killed.
Christina, get back over here!<eos> Oh, I don't like you recording me!<eos> What is this?<eos> Mama, I love it.<eos> Thank you, I love you.
♪ You know you got to cross your Rubicon Say, we all came here... ♪<eos> What did you just say to me?<eos> You disgust me.<eos> I can't even stand the sight of you!<eos> I can't do it for you.
Shane, I stole her song and now I'm stealing her movie role, too.<eos> Yeah, but that's the business she chose.<eos> "Big city, no pity," girl.<eos> "Big city, no pity," no doubt.<eos> - I love you all. I love you.
So, we wanna engage with maximum speed.<eos> Neutralize the shooters and then move on to our objective.<eos> There are two things I want you to keep in mind,<eos> Number one,<eos> I choose you for this squad because you are the most fearsome warriors on the planet.
Out! The rest of you, out now!<eos> These gentlemen are actually here to rescue you.<eos> Atticus?<eos> If it was down to me, you'd have been dead long ago.<eos> Delaney orders you shouldn't be harmed.
- What's that?<eos> Your new hotel, which burned badly down to the ground a few months back, was ruled arson by an official investigation.<eos> Now, I may have sold you your policy, sirs, but I didn't handle the claim.<eos> It was done by Douglas Jones, who works at our firm.<eos> - I thought you should know from me, unofficially, on my own... that this Mr. Jones did everything in his power to prevent you gentlemen from getting the insurance relief from the loss you suffered that I believe to this day you deserved.
Yeah, and she feels bad about that.<eos> Can we just pretend for one night that she's a friend?<eos> Who are we pretending as a friend?<eos> - Mona.<eos> - You guys, I'm begging you.
I don't need tissues.<eos> Em, today you do.<eos> I, Ezra, take thee, Aria to have and to hold from this day forward... for better, for worse for richer, for poorer in sickness and in health to love and to cherish till death do us part.<eos> If anyone can show a just cause why this couple cannot lawfully be joined together in matrimony let them speak now or forever hold their peace.<eos> By the power vested in me I now pronounce you husband and wife.
Sorry, are you already honeymoon drunk?<eos> - No!<eos> I'm, I'm happy for you.<eos> - We all are.<eos> I've always loved you two together.
Guys, I'm leaving for three weeks.<eos> Why is everybody crying?<eos> I don't know.<eos> For some reason, this feels like it's the end of something.<eos> I love you, guys.
They know we're coming, gentlemen.<eos> They've known we're coming for weeks. So don't be under any illusion.<eos> This will get ugly.<eos> We're gonna lose guys.<eos> I am not gonna lie to you about that.
We're gonna lose guys.<eos> I am not gonna lie to you about that.<eos> There will be casualties.<eos> But if you keep your wits about you, if you have faith in your ability, if you have faith in the ability of the men next to you, you will come out the tail end of this!<eos> I have faith in you!
Only we can help you.<eos> We have a saying in America.<eos> You can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs.<eos> I understand that sometimes it can be hard to see the helping hand, what with all the guns and the strange guys and the mess and what have you.<eos> But I assure you, this is the hand of helping.
- Yeah.<eos> So, the sex that you have is like... Hi, Celeste, Madeline!<eos> - How are you?<eos> - Hi, Renata.<eos> I was over there with my girlfriends, getting our drink on, and I saw you two.
You took a risk.<eos> We took a risk.<eos> But it was the right thing to do.<eos> I believe in you.<eos> You guys want me to leave you alone?
At least it's a plan.<eos> I can't promise this will work.<eos> You said he was dying anyway.<eos> What does he have to lose?<eos> I can hear you.
- Hide with the dead?<eos> - It was worth a try.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> It's too dangerous.<eos> We're not going to save anyone by freezing you guys to death.
I know. Which is why I think it should be you.<eos> I won't last two minutes in there.<eos> Then think of something else.<eos> Malia's right. It's all about the connection.<eos> When I was remembering him, I was also remembering the two of you together.
You want to hire us?<eos> You are still a private investigation. And security firm, are you not?<eos> No thanks to you.<eos> I am aware of the irony of this situation.<eos> I tried to put you out of business, And now I am asking you. To find out who's trying to kill me.
Now... I made this just for you.<eos> Keep staring, you'll blow his cover.<eos> Is that why you showed up,<eos> To make sure we don't succeed without you?<eos> I am responsible for you two.
So instead...<eos> - Sorry, go ahead.<eos> - No, it's fine.<eos> - Sophie.<eos> - For God's sakes, before I have the Hammer kill you both.
There is only one man to blame.<eos> 20 years ago... King Pastoria and the magic realm fought The Beast Forever.<eos> They fought bravely. And they lost.<eos> If it were not for me, Emerald City would have fallen like many great cities of Oz.<eos> I will protect you from The Beast Forever, who ravages our land.
20 years ago... King Pastoria and the magic realm fought The Beast Forever.<eos> They fought bravely. And they lost.<eos> If it were not for me, Emerald City would have fallen like many great cities of Oz.<eos> I will protect you from The Beast Forever, who ravages our land.<eos> I will protect you from the forbidden magic in the woods.
Only that one is a lie.<eos> Which one is that?<eos> Oz is a land of enchantment.<eos> Magic is its heart.<eos> Yet this enchantment could not save you from The Beast Forever.
I need someone to see me now.<eos> Wait.<eos> You don't have to do that.<eos> I do see you.<eos> I've lied to you...
I'll make them.<eos> In certain circles, I was known as the Wicked Witch of the West.<eos> Yeah, I heard that.<eos> As you once stood united with King Pastoria, you now stand with his child, the one true heir to the throne, Ozma.<eos> Follow us to Emerald City to end the one who imprisoned you:
It proves nothing.<eos> Possessions can be lost.<eos> And found.<eos> This boy is no Ozma.<eos> I am a Cardinal Witch and you will hear my truth or I'll gladly throw you back in prison if you find it more agreeable.
Because we are fair, you will hear the charges against you before you are sentenced.<eos> More than your apostate of a sister did for us.<eos> You and your Cardinal sisters are to blame for the end of our kind.<eos> She stands against her sisters.<eos> It was Mistress East who locked you in the prison.
It must have taken them days to arrange!<eos> - I know, I...<eos> - Then why the fuck didn't you warn us?<eos> !<eos> I did warn you!
My cursed fate!<eos> I'm going to get slaughtered over your love affair.<eos> Both of you will get yourself killed and drag me along too.<eos> Listen, stay away from her.<eos> If her man finds out, he'll bury you both alive.
- Oh, yeah.<eos> - Mmm-hmm. We dig.<eos> Where's the workbench?<eos> - Is there a garage?<eos> - Yeah. I'll show you.
- Thank you.<eos> - I'll make something for you.<eos> No, I'm fine.<eos> Boys... I've got a car.<eos> So I'm going to take you to school in half an hour.
What do they get out of it?<eos> The escape of the King from SS custody would disgrace the SS and consolidate the Army's Commander-in-Chief in his position of power here, and not just here... the repercussions would be felt all the way to Berlin.<eos> We have the support of the general staff in this business.<eos> What's the catch?<eos> The General will see you both now.
I'm just glad I never managed to chase you out of the artistic photo business.<eos> Glamour.<eos> We need it more than ever now.<eos> Whatever it is you're up to, you be careful, Superintendent.<eos> Arthur will take you half the way, then another car will take you on.
There is a calculable transformation in the real world, and solely because someone was there to watch it.<eos> Which may account for the fact that I have become significantly sweatier once I've noticed the mysterious stranger watching me from the back of the room.<eos> All right, that's it.<eos> Go get drunk.<eos> Hey, I remember you guys from...
Or we could call it what it really is:<eos> a pagan ritual, the celebration of the beginning of spring dating back about 12,000 years.<eos> So, when you see children dipping eggs in vinegar the colors of their favorite toys, or when you see the nation's youth fleeing south for copulation, or when they spread their seed over that sinking mass that is the great state of Florida, they all... without realizing it do it in her name.<eos> Ostara.<eos> Oh, it is a treasure and a treat to welcome you all to my home and on my day, my favorite day of the year.
And that's it?<eos> Just take a pill?<eos> Gabriel sometimes our problems are not as complex as we'd hoped.<eos> This should help with the sleep and the anxiety.<eos> VOICE ON RADIO: Now tell me that song doesn't make you want to dial up your old high-school sweetheart.
Shit, you all don't know you black yet.<eos> You think you just people.<eos> Let me be the first to tell you that you are all black.<eos> The moment these Dutch motherfuckers set foot here and decided they white, and you get to be black, and that's the nice name they call you...<eos> Let me paint a picture of what's waiting for you on the shore.
The only good news is the tobacco your grandkids are gonna farm for free is gonna give a shitload of these white motherfuckers cancer.<eos> And I ain't even started yet.<eos> A hundred years later. You're fucked.<eos> A hundred years after that.<eos> Fucked. A hundred years after you get free, you still getting fucked out a job and shot at by police.
Said you needed him.<eos> There's always another way.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> No. Food is cooked.<eos> Zorya Vechernyaya invited you for dinner, right?
We're programmed to process our experiences as having a beginning and an end, when, in reality... doesn't exist.<eos> It's just one long, drawn-out middle.<eos> Some of you are newer than others, but I wanted to create a select group that could see what it is that I built.<eos> But before we do that, I'd like to take a moment and have you join me in... bowing our heads...<eos> And let your subconscious... take you somewhere else.
Hey, Thomas.<eos> Everyone wants to know what's going on.<eos> Welcome, everybody.<eos> Nice to have you all here.<eos> I asked you to gather here today because I thought that we should be honest.
Eggs will be up in ten.<eos> Actually, to be honest, Grandma,<eos> I didn't sleep at all last night. Hmm?<eos> I snuck out.<eos> I didn't want to wake you, so I... I went out the window.
It was nothing.<eos> It was stupid.<eos> Didn't look like nothing.<eos> I've got a family of brawlers, that's what I got here.<eos> Trying to keep you two on the right side of the law.
Oh, my God, how did you find us?<eos> - I deserve to be here.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> Because you don't like me?<eos> 'Cause I embarrassed you?
Do you care about them?<eos> Friends?<eos> What friends?<eos> Now, I know you have friends.<eos> I see you in the halls.
- Oh, I'm so sorry, Tony.<eos> Sorry, I did tell Marion four.<eos> No, she didn't.<eos> - It's not a problem.<eos> Come on, boys, we need to get going because I want you dressed and showered by the time everyone arrives.
You shouldn't be making contact with me.<eos> How the hell did you find out where...?<eos> It doesn't matter, I can't talk.<eos> Of course you can.<eos> I saw you yesterday, in the supermarket.
All of this... came at a cost.<eos> It was lives, arms, legs.<eos> The peace we have with the Saviors is uneasy, but it is peace.<eos> I have to hold on to it.<eos> I have to try. Although the Kingdom cannot grant you the aid you desire, the King is sympathetic to your plight.
Shit you not.<eos> Almost forgot.<eos> Set that down.<eos> Well, fair is fair.<eos> We're not leaving you high and dry when it comes to medical solutions.
The Sanctuary?<eos> Where Negan lives.<eos> That's what they call it.<eos> I can radio back to them and say everything's okay.<eos> You drive the trucks back, and I can lead you right inside, and, with the right plan, we can wipe out the rest.
Sorry about the gun.<eos> You know, it's dangerous.<eos> It's all right.<eos> Why don't you guys come down to the gym?<eos> I'll give you a... give you some training for free, yeah?
But if obviously it's too late, then that's fine, too.<eos> I love you.<eos> Byebye.<eos> Okay, girls, listen up.<eos> They have you for three hours.
Byebye.<eos> Okay, girls, listen up.<eos> They have you for three hours.<eos> That's all they paid for, that's all they get.<eos> If they try get you to stay longer, tell them no.
If they try get you to stay longer, tell them no.<eos> We've shot here before.<eos> They're cool.<eos> I'm not finished.<eos> They try to ask you to do something you're not comfortable with, politely tell them to fuck right off and call me.
Sorry, but can we not kill him?<eos> C-Can we just take him prisoner?<eos> When did I lose control here?<eos> Listen to me... Both of you kids need to get out of this environment so we can properly deal with your parents' divorce!<eos> Alternatively, I have a freaking portal gun, and I can leave the two of you here forever!
Do it.<eos> Okay, you win, Pickle Man.<eos> I'm unsealing the building.<eos> No, thanks.<eos> I'm coming for you now.
"Obviously?"<eos> You came here and defeated our arch nemesis... while so drunk you don't remember doing it?<eos> That's something "obvious" to you?<eos> Look, I'm a lit... little more complex than you guys, and, no offense, but I've always suspected that a lot of what you do in a year could be knocked out in a couple of hours.<eos> So I thought, why not just do your job for you, so we can have a little fun game.
- They obstructed the harbor.<eos> - I know.<eos> - Two ships they sunk. - I know, I...<eos> - Then why didn't you warn us?<eos> - I did warn you!
Get up.<eos> Celeste, you're fine.<eos> Hey, you just got the wind knocked out of you.<eos> Mom, we got to go.<eos> Hey, Mommy isn't feeling well today, so I'm going to take you guys to school.
It's perfect.<eos> Thank you very much, Kelly. Thank you very much.<eos> All right, let's hit the road.<eos> We don't wanna be late, do we?<eos> Bye, kids. Love you.
I'm Lieutenant Sales.<eos> - Forgive me, lieutenant.<eos> - At ease.<eos> I'm to report to Captain Picó.<eos> He's been expecting you.
Olivella?<eos> Come in, Father.<eos> It's good to see you.<eos> Not for me.<eos> The Carlán treated you like a whore, but you've managed to live like a lady.
_<eos> Okay, Brett, you're on in three, two... one.<eos> Today, I don't even feel worthy of being here.<eos> Today, my soul is in crisis.<eos> I have failed you, and I have failed myself.
Fight the Dane!<eos> Test your sword-craft!<eos> Do battle with a turd, directly from the devil's arse!<eos> You can cut him, but you cannot kill him!<eos> And if he kills you, then so be it!
No, thanks.<eos> You don't care that somebody's been killed?<eos> No, not really.<eos> Of course not. Why would you?<eos> All you care about is fucking each other and Frasier!
Excuse me?<eos> Excuse me, but you're lying.<eos> You're just... You're just saying what we want to hear.<eos> You invited me here, and then you rejected me.<eos> But I sat outside your house all night and I followed you here, so you'd have no choice but to let me get into your machine.
- What he did?<eos> - Yes.<eos> But a very wise woman recently told me that one should not allow their personal feelings to cloud the reality of the situation, which in both that case and this... is that Billy has influence that is best not ignored.<eos> That sounds like good advice.<eos> Was it given before or after he tried to kill the two of you?
You're going to help us find her?<eos> Find her?<eos> I have her.<eos> I am responsible... for delivering all 42 of you to the law in Port Royal.<eos> Let me dispel that notion for you right away.
I get the cache, and guaranteed safe passage off the island for everyone in this fort... and you get Nassau.<eos> The money isn't ours to give.<eos> We have partners who would almost certainly rather fight this out than lose their treasury.<eos> Your partners are your problem.<eos> There is a reason why I invited you here and not them.
Copy that.<eos> Doors closing.<eos> They're heading to the mezzanine.<eos> Copy that.<eos> Linking you into the station's camera network.
NYPD's working on closing down the tunnels.<eos> Director Mullins.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> You've released my father?<eos> The one person who might be able to lead you to Jadalla Bin-Khalid?
No wonder this place is in the crapper.<eos> Inside the house!<eos> We only want the girl!<eos> Just send her out and then we're done.<eos> Listen to me, the man that hired you, Simms, he's been taken down.
If you are interested in stories with happy endings, then you would be better off somewhere else.<eos> In this story, not only is there no happy ending, there is no happy beginning, and very few happy things in the middle.<eos> My name is Lemony Snicket.<eos> It is my solemn duty to bring to light the sorry history of the Baudelaire children as it happened so many years ago.<eos> But you in the audience have no such obligation, and I would advise all our viewers to turn away immediately and watch something more pleasant instead.
And if you haven't... you cannot possibly imagine it.<eos> I've never been through anything like this myself, but I can imagine just how you feel.<eos> I did think you'd want to see what remains of your home, even though it is... more or less, um...<eos> It's all gone.<eos> I just want to assure you Baudelaires that you have absolutely nothing...
The other lives in a cave and talks to sheep.<eos> They each think the other has it better.<eos> I regret to inform you, the Baudelaires' fate was worse.<eos> Chop-chop, Baudelaires!<eos> Now that I've found you a suitable guardian, I'm going to take you to your new home before banking hours begin.
No, I don't even really know him that well.<eos> He's... he's just my neighbor.<eos> His house is over there.<eos> That's strange.<eos> He said specifically he was waiting very eagerly to get his hands on you.
Goodbye, Violet. Goodbye, Klaus. Goodbye, Sunny.<eos> I hope you'll be happy here.<eos> I'll still check in on you occasionally.<eos> If you need anything or have questions, you can reach me at the bank.<eos> Well, children, before I give you a tour of your new home, aren't you going to say "How do you do?" to your new guardian?
What? No roast beef?<eos> You didn't tell us you wanted roast beef.<eos> Look at my guests!<eos> They... they can hardly touch this revolting foreign food.<eos> In agreeing to adopt you, I became your father.
I do.<eos> - Lily, do you take...<eos> - I do.<eos> Okay.<eos> Um, well, then by the power vested in me I pronounce you husband and wife.
But she'll keep on calling you.<eos> And when she does, you'll step into that painting and feel the swell beneath your feet.<eos> It'll all come back as if it were like yesterday.<eos> Is that so?<eos> I've watched you and yours handle the account since I and mine left it.
- That's definitely authentic.<eos> - You mean antique.<eos> Yeah, I'm guessing early Bronze Age.<eos> Last worn during the reign of Seyyid Said.<eos> I don't know you and I'm sorry if you have a problem with me.
Someone reminded me to look up.<eos> And I wanted to tell that someone thank you.<eos> I wanted to tell you that I love you.<eos> I love you.<eos> Tonight, I want everyone in this room to know... that I see you. I believe in you.
- That's definitely authentic.<eos> - You mean antique.<eos> Yeah, I'm guessing early Bronze Age.<eos> Last worn during the reign of Seyyid Said.<eos> I don't know you and I'm sorry if you have a problem with me.

- Yeah... - Amanita.<eos> Is Nomi okay?<eos> She'll be fine.<eos> Lola says she's a bit concussed but she'll sleep it off.<eos> She was more worried about you.
And that's why I'm back.<eos> Because I want it to mean that again.<eos> Believe in me.<eos> Trust me.<eos> And I promise... I will take care of you.
I no longer have proximity to it, and you no longer have proximity to me.<eos> Have fun with the children.<eos> Hey, kids, I'm leaving!<eos> Your daddy's here!<eos> I love you!
- I can only imagine.<eos> yeah, just think, now you don't have to do that anymore.<eos> - I'm just gonna go to bed and figure out what to do tomorrow. - Hey, Norma?<eos> Can I stay here for a little while?<eos> I want to look after you guys while-- while he's still in the basement.
Got it.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I'm sorry, I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't mean to scare you.<eos> We tried to get you over the intercom, and then when you didn't come, I might have kind of panicked.
- to give up on her?<eos> - I refuse to do that.<eos> Dr. Brennan saw something in these remains.<eos> Okay. Then it's up to you to find it.<eos> Look, Brennan trained you for this exact moment.
- I refuse to do that.<eos> Dr. Brennan saw something in these remains.<eos> Okay. Then it's up to you to find it.<eos> Look, Brennan trained you for this exact moment.<eos> She's counting on you.
After I died, you went through some rough time.<eos> You did some things you were not proud of.<eos> Yes?<eos> - It's true.<eos> - Remember how angry you were at me for leaving you and Regina when you were three?
That's very true.<eos> I'm... that was... the actor.<eos> Look.<eos> I'm not Columbo.<eos> My husband doesn't believe you're true suspects. Yeah.
I do not. Oh.<eos> We will be bagging your sniper and I will stay on the pill.<eos> I just- - I'm... I'm not ready to say this is it.<eos> What is it, Aubrey?<eos> Hey, uh, sorry to pull you guys in, but, uh, I thought you'd want to see this.
Aubrey. FBI.<eos> Charlene was our brave teller who was held up.<eos> I'm sorry, I already spoke to an agent about the robbery.<eos> Yeah, this is about a homicide.<eos> The man who robbed you was murdered.
Mm. As I'm sure you're aware, there are very few jobs in the D.C. area for a forensic anthropologist.<eos> A fact that Arastoo reminds me of on a daily basis.<eos> Getting my doctorate means that it's time to move on.<eos> And wearing the jacket just makes it a little too real for me.<eos> And the fact that I'll soon have to leave all of you.
I just need to know the last time that Cam's ID was used.<eos> Seeley, I just told you.<eos> I know, just do it.<eos> Okay, uh, her ID was used last night at 2:42 a.m. to get onto the platform.<eos> Well, I assure you last night I was nowhere near the Jeffersonian.
60% of married adults have had an affair!<eos> - 60%!<eos> - Quinn!<eos> There is no replacing Frankie, but if anyone is qualified to uphold the values he held so dear, it's Vice President-elect Cyrus Beene, the man Governor Vargas himself chose to be his successor in the event of such a tragedy.<eos> God bless you, and God bless America.
We did it, Mike.<eos> However this plays out... I have no regrets.<eos> Michael!<eos> Well, if you're watching this, that means you're safe.<eos> I wish I could be there with you, but as you know now, I wouldn't have had much time.
Come on, let's go!<eos> How did you find us? A contact at the airport saw you get into the wrong taxi.<eos> You're lucky I found you.<eos> This is very radicalized neighborhood.<eos> Whoever set you up couldn't have set you up in a worse way.
I know that Lucas destroyed your memorial but do we really think he's as disgusting as all this?<eos> I could kick myself.<eos> I was so close to catching him.<eos> I'm just glad he didn't hurt you guys.<eos> He clearly didn't expect you to be home.
You're not an ideal shoulder to lean on when rolling on soldier brain.<eos> You called her "my precious."<eos> You don't plan on throwing her in Mount Doom, do you?<eos> It had to be Blaine.<eos> The world is mourning the passing of Rob Thomas today, and nobody's got you covered like 98.7.
Here's to holding off earthquakes.<eos> I never figured you for Marcel's lackey.<eos> I'm nobody's lackey, Klaus.<eos> As far as I'm concerned, this is justice.<eos> And will it be justice when I escape and come for you both?
I know how to stop A.L.I.E.<eos> I see it. It's a kill switch.<eos> Come on, Clarke.<eos> The nuclear power plants that were destroyed by the bombs have begun to melt down.<eos> The Earth's surface will be uninhabitable, so, you see, the City of Light is the only thing that can save you.
Eli, put that rifle on the floor!<eos> If we give them a fight, they'll kill us!<eos> They're gonna kill us anyway, Momma.<eos> No, not you three. You're young.<eos> They'll want you as captives.
Do it.<eos> - God.<eos> - Right?<eos> - Hmm. - Touch it.<eos> We can hear you, freak.
And hurry up.<eos> Sunny.<eos> Here.<eos> I'll find you.<eos> Both of you, I promise.
You ready?<eos> Nice shot.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey, Beermeister. Thought you didn't drink.<eos> Yeah, well, you damn frogmen drove me to it.
Take your hands away from your cards.<eos> Call.<eos> Nobody touches the cards.<eos> Nobody.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, with my apologies... I need to ask you to leave at this time.
Motherfucker.<eos> _<eos> What the hell are you doing here?<eos> I get a panic call from Carly in the middle of the night.<eos> She's worried about you guys.
Do you have an address for her?<eos> We tried calling her, but no answer.<eos> Address is here.<eos> You are not going to try to find him, are you?<eos> God be with you, then.
Tell Annalise I'm sorry!<eos> Please!<eos> Tell her I'm sorry!<eos> Obviously, this is a difficult time.<eos> I urge you to use the resources we have available...
I know you didn't have to.<eos> You could have just... run off to Brazil already.<eos> Is that really an option?<eos> I failed.<eos> I promised to protect you all, and I didn't.
Oh, my God, do you think she has this room bugged?<eos> Hello?<eos> I can't make Laurel not be mad at you.<eos> She gets to be mad right now, and whatever other emotions she's feeling.<eos> It's called the grief process, so don't try and trick me into making you two besties or something.
I'm new.<eos> And I have a problem... with drinking, yes.<eos> But I got other problems, too...<eos> Lots of them.<eos> Like, I could take up this entire meeting talking about them, and you would be entertained.
Maybe we all just need to take a deep breath.<eos> Now Wes is gonna go down for Sam and Rebecca, and the two of you get off.<eos> Well, you know what? You need to grow the hell up!<eos> I'm doing this for you... Each of you...<eos> So you don't have to go to prison and get naked in group showers and crap in front of people that might rape you.
It's our last chance. No.<eos> It's not here, no.<eos> That's because I have it in my cell.<eos> My armies of the caliphate are coming closer.<eos> The moment they reach this place, all of you will be put down like the dogs that you are.
If I don't smother that gun, they'll kill us all.<eos> Move back!<eos> Move back!<eos> Go! Let me through!<eos> Poseidon sent you?
Sana'a is falling.<eos> We work together or we both die.<eos> You have my word.<eos> It's abu ramal that Poseidon wants free.<eos> Kellerman: Poseidon sent you?
I want a map to this Phaeacia place.<eos> You do realize this is Yemen, don't you?<eos> Phaeacia is a hundred people. Mud huts.<eos> There is no map.<eos> But I can lead you there.
Look, protocol says no.<eos> We stay clear of CIA, any offensive action.<eos> We're surveillance only.<eos> We just want to put eyes on him.<eos> I think I can get you in as observers under interagency auspices.
A picture of my son.<eos> We weren't at NSA yesterday.<eos> I'm telling you, this is a mistake.<eos> And it's a mistake to lie to me.<eos> I can have you prosecuted.
He's a CIA operative, deep cover.<eos> He runs a splinter cell called 21-Void.<eos> What does this have to do with you?<eos> He targeted me for my skills, blackmailed me.<eos> He told me if I didn't agree to come work for him, he'd go after you and Linc, put you both in jail.
Oh, my God, they got inside.<eos> How did they get inside?<eos> When you snuck in here, did you secure the doors behind you?<eos> I... You put everyone at risk.<eos> My team's scattered all over the place out there, looking for you.
We try that now, we drain the generator.<eos> Yeah, okay, so we just power the door and get the hell out of here.<eos> And then the lights go out and the Glimmers tear us all apart.<eos> Even if you get the doors open, you won't make it.<eos> They'll swarm the car, rip you to shreds.
We exchange hostages.<eos> One of yours for Avasarala.<eos> So I know you won't shoot us down after we launch.<eos> This is a pleasure yacht, not a gunship.<eos> But I'll escort you to the hangar myself.
I hate you.<eos> I hate both of you.<eos> You're so lucky 'cause you had each other!<eos> Well, that's the King brothers.<eos> That's why I can expect something different from you.
All right, so, what does that mean?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I think he's trying to tell me, something bad is gonna happen.<eos> Like they're gonna kill him anyways, just stay away.<eos> Fucking A, they're gonna kill you both.
You and your friends are prohibited from any further involvement for the hunt for Jace Wayland.<eos> What?<eos> The rest of you, back to work.<eos> I'm lifting the lockdown on the Institute, except for Clary and Jocelyn.<eos> Given your relationship to Valentine and Jace, I want to keep a close eye on you.
You can't seriously expect us to believe that.<eos> - Luke, you're not helping.<eos> - It's okay, Clarissa.<eos> I know where Valentine's hiding.<eos> I can lead you to him.
Execute Clary Fairchild on sight.<eos> Care to rethink that?<eos> You'd be rotting in the City of Bones had she not insisted we save your life.<eos> Then consider this my way of returning the favor.<eos> By killing her, I'll be saving you from yourselves.
Why Izzy?<eos> What does a Greater Demon want with her?<eos> I'm not sure...<eos> I think I know who we could ask.<eos> I have no idea what you're talking about... but it's so nice to see the both of you.
Hey! I was just trying to call you ♪ In my hands, in my heart ♪<eos> - Long day. - Yeah.<eos> Why didn't you tell me?<eos> I found out Jace isn't your brother.<eos> I was thinking maybe, um, maybe the reason you didn't tell me is 'cause you guys used to have a thing.
- Just trying to figure out what the Legion of Doom wants with those two amulets.<eos> The "Legion of Doom"?<eos> Darhk, Merlyn, and the Speedster.<eos> It's from a Hanna-Barbera cartoon I liked when I was a kid.<eos> Sorry I woke you guys up.
Ah, Mr. Lucas, you have something that we have traveled a very long way to find.<eos> A piece of the Spear of Destiny.<eos> Where is it?<eos> Lady and gentlemen, if you don't mind,<eos> - hands up. - And if you do mind, we'd be happy to kill you.
And for that matter... why would a man who can travel through time always be in such a hurry?<eos> We don't have time for this.<eos> Oh, I've got all the time in the world.<eos> Okay, you two have made your point.<eos> I need you as much as you need me, all right.
You can have her back.<eos> You're so close.<eos> But not if she's dead.<eos> So put that mechanical genius to good work.<eos> Make me what I need. And I will let you both go.
Yeah? Well, I say take her down.<eos> Overwatch! You heard the boss.<eos> This is an eyes-only operation for you.<eos> I have eyes on.<eos> Boys, I just put you on a separate channel.
- Still unconscious.<eos> I don't know about you, man, but my head is still spinning a bit.<eos> It's his meta power.<eos> I think he can control Sonic waves.<eos> It would explain how he disorientated you guys and counteracted Tina and...
Malcolm, can you fly a plane?<eos> If it's anything like the 3 Gulfstreams<eos> I used to have, yes. Get them to the mainland and then come right back for us.<eos> We are not leaving you here.<eos> I need to focus, and that means getting you out of harm's way, and despite my better instincts, when this is all over, I will come back for you.
- I mean Slade Wilson and Malcolm Merlyn.<eos> - Thea-- - No. We are orphans because of those two.<eos> You know what I'm up against here.<eos> Yeah, so why are you sending Curtis and I away?<eos> Because I need the two of you to keep Felicity and Samantha safe.
What do you mean?<eos> Because she has a record that won't let her move in if he's fostering' me.<eos> First of all, I don't think that's the only reason.<eos> Why didn't you tell me?<eos> 'Cause all we do is talk about you, Callie.
Hi. Hi, Quentin.<eos> I wasn't expecting to see you today.<eos> Well, you know, that's the thing about rehab.<eos> It's a long process, and then it ain't, and by the looks of that assistant out there, you need me back bad.<eos> How about I give you guys a moment?
Yeah? You and what army?<eos> This one!<eos> It's amazing the loyalty money can buy.<eos> Take them down.<eos> I'm gonna enjoy watching them take you down.
I'll meet you by the side entrance.<eos> The Bratva aren't backing down, which means I have to stop them.<eos> John has convinced me not to do it alone.<eos> I wanted to shut all of this down because I was afraid.<eos> I was afraid that asking you to kill Chase would corrupt you more than... More than I already have.
I wanted to shut all of this down because I was afraid.<eos> I was afraid that asking you to kill Chase would corrupt you more than... More than I already have.<eos> To me, the... the...<eos> The Bratva was the best option, but John insists that as a team, we can find another way to bring Chase to justice.<eos> You've put your faith in me, and I'm putting my faith in you now.
We're not abandoning you. I understand that you're not abandoning me.<eos> You're doing what I'm asking you to do because ch...<eos> Chase knows how I think.<eos> He knows that if he puts the two of you in danger... And he's going to try to... that...<eos> My instinct will be to pull you close.
Don't worry.<eos> They'll never connect this to you.<eos> There are no surveillance cameras.<eos> I saw you do it, and if I didn't know it was you, I wouldn't know it was you.<eos> I'm glad to see you guys.
We're on our way.<eos> You might want to change your clothes.<eos> They're here, but... But they took a cab.<eos> Why would they take a cab?<eos> You took a cab so you wouldn't be followed, right?
So I hate to say this, Nick, but maybe they're right.<eos> Maybe you got to go.<eos> You should go back to the precinct.<eos> Get back to work like everything's normal.<eos> I don't want you getting drawn into this any more than you already have.
It's not complicated.<eos> You cheated on her.<eos> There's a reason she returned to Idris as soon as you got here.<eos> I made a mistake.<eos> I never meant to hurt you... but I fell in love.
We swore an oath and have a duty to broadcast the truth to the system.<eos> Listen to me, Doctor, you have no idea what you're dealing with here.<eos> It's not a disease, it's obviously some kind of weapon.<eos> You Martians have been using these Belters as guinea pigs.<eos> If any one of you are infected, you could wipe out millions!
Let's get out of here. This guy's no soldier, he's too busy counting' bolts.<eos> Who the hell is this asshole?<eos> I'm the asshole who found your operative.<eos> Her name was Juliette Andromeda mao.<eos> In case you're interested, she died, alone, on Eros, waiting for you opa chair-jockeys to come help her.
Staz, split them up into four groups.<eos> Five of you guys come with me.<eos> Stay sharp.<eos> Everybody stay sharp and watch the doors and corners.<eos> Doors and corners are where they get you.
I have saved his child.<eos> This baby would most likely have died in childbirth to a woman in such poor health as you.<eos> Do you not see all I have done for you?<eos> You... bitch.<eos> Your bastard child would have been born out of wedlock, and Cotton would have had no choice but to turn his back, deny his upstanding name to both of you.
Let my truth be heard!<eos> Look around you.<eos> We live in the sludge running from those fine houses.<eos> Their Puritan piss washes right into your alleyways.<eos> You ever wonder why they treat you like dogs?
I'm Troy.<eos> Please, please sit, ma'am.<eos> Tea?<eos> Coffee wasn't brewed, so, uh...<eos> Oh, i-- i spoke to my men and, uh, you shouldn't have been handled so roughly.
My mother passed, ma'am.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - I don't get lost much anyway.<eos> So, what happens to us after we're processed?<eos> Oh, well, I mean, I don't wanna send you ladies out to slaughter, but, I mean, you get this squared away, you get supplied, and off you go.
Look, look, look. - God damn it! Come on.<eos> Listen to me. We are desperate. We need funding.<eos> - You need funding?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Hit a million daily active users while sustaining the same kind of growth, then everybody in town will be trying to kidnap you.
That is my decision, and my decision is final.<eos> Ned Umber.<eos> Alys Karstark.<eos> For centuries, our families fought side by side on the battlefield.<eos> I ask you to pledge your loyalty once again to House Stark, to serve as our bannermen and come to our aid whenever called upon.
I done worse than that.<eos> Dying worked for me.<eos> Everyone should try it at least once.<eos> Seems like you've walked the earth a couple hundred years in those boots already, so, you're due.<eos> The night of Samhain, the spirits can spill freely into our world, but if you wear a disguise, like that, then they'll take you for one of their own.
The lep...?<eos> Prechaun.<eos> Leprechaun, that's right.<eos> So we just leave a small ration from our harvest.<eos> 'Cause if they so choose, they can lead you off the path you've trod a thousand times before.
You are a clever fellow, Tarquin, but... I wish Ed were here.<eos> My sole job as deputy chief of staff is to serve you with the exact same zeal and smarts as Mr. Nygma would.<eos> Thank you all so much for coming.<eos> Thanks, everyone.<eos> Bob, great to see you. Bill, take care.
- No.<eos> No, he's alive. They... they went to a lot of trouble to get him there.<eos> They need him for something.<eos> We're gonna figure out what that is.<eos> There you guys are.
It's always been me, Barry.<eos> Man, what did we ever do to you?<eos> You took everything from me!<eos> I never asked for any of this, Joe.<eos> I am only this way because of you.
That... that kind of love is rare.<eos> Dad, I wish it were that simple.<eos> Simple.<eos> Look, only you know... what's good for you.<eos> But with the kind of lives... that you two have, that love between the two of you, that is the one thing... that should stay simple.
Love is about... letting yourself be saved.<eos> It's not just about saving other people.<eos> Even if you are superheroes.<eos> Anyway, I'm sorry that I had to, like, mess with you a little bit.<eos> I was just trying to get you to play the game, do the song and dance.
Iris's death shouldn't have driven me away from you all.<eos> I mean...<eos> I mean, it should've driven me closer.<eos> This isn't what she would want.<eos> But I'm here now to tell you that... no matter what happens in the past, I will not abandon you.
- Pathetic.<eos> Hey, Adam, um, you haven't talked to Cassie lately, have you?<eos> I mean, you saw her last night, obviously but in the last few hours or so?<eos> Yeah, not since this morning.<eos> That's great, by the way, the whole you and Cassie thing.
'<eos> 'You girls at the airport?<eos> Uh... Uh, yeah, she-she just came home but we can't go to Vegas with you.<eos> Umm, we really just need to be home right now.<eos> 'But I already bought your tickets' 'and I'm here in Vegas waiting for you.'
I know if I do, you'll talk me out of running away from all my problems.<eos> You're gonna make me face a future without Elena.<eos> Then you're gonna help make me the best man that I can possibly be.<eos> The same way she did.<eos> And I'm absolutely terrified of failing you both.
Then you're gonna help make me the best man that I can possibly be.<eos> The same way she did.<eos> And I'm absolutely terrified of failing you both.<eos> ♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh... ♪ So I'm leaving.<eos> Because I'd rather let you down once than let you down for the rest of your life.
Rings.<eos> Now.<eos> With this ring, I thee wed.<eos> With this ring, I thee wed.<eos> With the power recently vested in me by the Commonwealth of Virginia, I now pronounce you husband and wife.
But I don't have any magic.<eos> Of course you do, luv.<eos> How else do you think you've been able to stay connected to me?<eos> Let them siphon you, Bonnie.<eos> Tell them to use the magic to save you. - No.
Previously on The Vampire Diaries...<eos> When that bell rings 12 times, the the hellfire it unleashes, wipes out everything for miles.<eos> In this case...<eos> All of us in Mystic Falls.<eos> I now pronounce you husband and wife.
I am not a selfish person. I was vilified for doing what anyone in my position would do.<eos> You went back for your computer.<eos> That's not about survival, that's about stuff.<eos> It was about instinct, but thank you for reminding me why I'm doing this and for helping me to improve upon my experiment.<eos> Truth is, Dr. Scott only mutilated her hand because she was being observed by you.
Please don't kill yourself with your own bullet.<eos> We wouldn't be able to conduct the final part of this experiment.<eos> Time for you to make a choice.<eos> In this vial, an antidote that will save Benji's life.<eos> In vial numero dos, poisonous gas that will kill you if you enter the room.
My family?<eos> See, Cass is our family, so we can't let you hurt him.<eos> Let me?<eos> We don't wanna kill you.<eos> I don't wanna kill you.
And leave you here with her?<eos> You kidding me?<eos> She --<eos> She is no threat whatsoever to humans.<eos> And she can hear you.
I'm a Winchester.<eos> Works for me.<eos> Mom!<eos> Don't!<eos> I love you.
Dean.<eos> Wally.<eos> Hi.<eos> These are my sons. Hi.<eos> Glad to meet you. She said a lot of good things.
And what do you want?<eos> The name's Crowley.<eos> King of the Crossroads?<eos> I've been sent by Hell.<eos> And what? Don't they teach you how to knock in hell?
Thank you.<eos> Knowing you, it... it's been the best part of my life.<eos> And the things that... the things we've shared together, they have changed me.<eos> You're my family.<eos> I love you.
I'm actually still sort of resting up after that whole Ramiel thing.<eos> But if you need me...<eos> You sure?<eos> Okay, rain check.<eos> Hey, I love you.
I'm a demon, you're Rosemary, complete with baby.<eos> Please.<eos> You humans.<eos> You've been fed so much propaganda.<eos> What did they teach you about Lucifer at Sunday School?
I'm careful!<eos> You need to tell her the truth.<eos> You know what?<eos> Screw you.<eos> I'm so sick of you guys dive-bombing my life, pretending like you care.
My loyal... Ish subjects, these troubled times,<eos> I'm aware there might be some confusion as to where you're supposed to place your loyalty.<eos> Even with Lucifer back in the cage, there are those of you who would try to help him...<eos> Because he scares you or engorges you.<eos> Just the chance that Lucifer could come back, the rumor, would've been enough to keep some of you working against me, undermining me, being a royal pain in my...
Okay. I mean, people come to town, they work in the plant for a while, then they get bored and restless, and they, you know, move on.<eos> And daryn?<eos> You know, maybe daryn thinks he say black bill, but let's be honest.<eos> Kid was drunk, high, or both.<eos> And I'll bet you dollars to doughnuts, daryn's just holed up, sleeping one off.
I will be.<eos> I just...<eos> I need to finish this.<eos> I miss you boys.<eos> I love you.
I'm sorry I haven't been there for you and Sam, but I wanna be.<eos> I will be.<eos> I just... I need to finish this.<eos> I miss you boys.<eos> I love you.
Since I've been back,<eos> I know...<eos> I've been distant.<eos> Cold, even.<eos> Leaving you, working with them...
Unh-unh. Once, maybe.<eos> So why are you here?<eos> Well, whenever there's a world-ending crisis at hand,<eos> I know where to place my bets.<eos> It's on you, you big, beautiful, lumbering piles of flannel.
What's he up to?<eos> Don't be so suspicious.<eos> Hey, thanks for coming. That's all right.<eos> Ben?<eos> Good to see you looking so well. I haven't seen you since court.
Now that is the plan, I know it!<eos> One... may be overpowered. Two can defend themselves.<eos> A cord of three is not so quickly broken<eos> Now that you are bound together, Uhtred and Gisela...<eos> I can declare you man and wife.
It is a legal term and it applies to Count Olaf.<eos> The actor is acting as your parent. And as your legal guardian, Count Olaf may raise you using any method he sees fit.<eos> So I'm sorry if your parents didn't make you do household chores, or if you like their friends more than you like Count Olaf's friends.<eos> But there are certain things you must get used to.<eos> Now, I'm sorry if I have to usher you out posthaste, but I've got work to do.
But there are certain things you must get used to.<eos> Now, I'm sorry if I have to usher you out posthaste, but I've got work to do.<eos> "Posthaste" means "very, very... "<eos> It means he'll do nothing to help us.<eos> Oh, on the contrary, I'll have my new secretary give you a ride home as soon as he's finished typing up that report.
Poco De Laurentiis.<eos> In loco parentis.<eos> The point is, I can order you to participate, and you must obey.<eos> Now go talk to the woman in the wig.<eos> I can't stand looking at you anymore.
You will suddenly find yourself in the enviable position of being a struggling actress in middle age.<eos> It's almost too good to be true.<eos> It is.<eos> Justice Strauss, Count Olaf is...<eos> Count Olaf is welcoming you into his life by making you an important part of this theatrical enterprise.
Prisoners.<eos> Listen to us.<eos> Count Olaf is...<eos> No, no, no, no. You listen to me, little boy, and you listen very carefully.<eos> The only reason why Count Olaf hasn't torn you limb from limb is because he hasn't gotten a hold of your fortune.
Count Olaf is...<eos> No, no, no, no. You listen to me, little boy, and you listen very carefully.<eos> The only reason why Count Olaf hasn't torn you limb from limb is because he hasn't gotten a hold of your fortune.<eos> But you ask yourself this question, all of you:<eos> What reason would he have to keep you alive after he's got your money?
- Do you take this woman...<eos> - Man.<eos> Man.<eos> I do.<eos> By the powers vested in me by going to law school, I now pronounce you Count and Countess.
- as my secretary.<eos> - Hear, hear!<eos> Jacquelyn, is that you?<eos> - Where have you been?<eos> - I was kidnapped by Count Olaf's associates and tied to a tree before I could tell you that the Baudelaires' uncle, Dr. Montgomery, was designated by the parents as their legal guardian and has been waiting to hear from you.
What? After all Justice Strauss has done for us?<eos> We never would've figured out Count Olaf's plan without Justice Strauss and her library.<eos> That may be so, but your parents' will is very specific.<eos> He's right.<eos> There's a vigorously fixed destination your parents had in mind for you, and it is not with Count Olaf or Justice Strauss.
If I were you, I would look away before viewing any of the horrible and horrifying events that comprise this ghastly new episode...<eos> It's a brand-new episode in your lives, Baudelaires.<eos> In a few minutes you'll be meeting your new guardian, Dr. Montgomery.<eos> He's your closest living relative and apparently should've been your guardian all along, according to your deceased parents' will.<eos> I'm beginning to think it was a mistake to listen to that oddly-dressed consultant who walked into my office with no references and no identification, and who suggested that I place you in Count Olaf's care.
He's your closest living relative and apparently should've been your guardian all along, according to your deceased parents' will.<eos> I'm beginning to think it was a mistake to listen to that oddly-dressed consultant who walked into my office with no references and no identification, and who suggested that I place you in Count Olaf's care.<eos> My siblings and I wholeheartedly agree.<eos> You're disgrace to your profession.<eos> My recently-rehired secretary Jacquelyn is nervous that Count Olaf is still at large, but I don't think Olaf will be able to find you way out here.
Uh, let me just unlock all these important security measures and I'll join you in the Reptile Room!<eos> Retinal scan one.<eos> Retinal scan two.<eos> I am so sorry, Baudelaires, that you were frightened by that man who arrived earlier.<eos> Um, it makes sense that you were alarmed, being that he chased you up and down the stairs with a knife.
Yeah, and then just keep...<eos> Get in. All right.<eos> We don't know what you're up to, but we will find out.<eos> If anything happens to my sisters or me, you'll never get your hands on the Baudelaire fortune.<eos> If I wanted to harm you, orphan, your blood would be streaming out of this car like a waterfall.
I have some unfinished business with Stephano.<eos> - Will you be okay?<eos> - Of course.<eos> I am your guardian.<eos> It is my job... and my delight, might I add, to keep you safe.
I wouldn't have had to kill Monty and we'd all be on our way to Peru, where I would have had to kill Monty.<eos> God, I hate driving stick.<eos> You're just gonna leave him there?<eos> Trust me, he doesn't mind.<eos> Of course, after they discover he's dead, you'll be long gone, and I'll be taking advantage of Peru's extremely lax guardianship laws.
He was more than that.<eos> He was much, much more than appropriate.<eos> Please don't let him be our new guardian.<eos> Oh, don't be silly, children.<eos> It is quite shocking that Dr. Montgomery has died, but I'm not going to simply just hand you and your fortune over to his assistant.
Come on, Klaus.<eos> The adults won't take care of anything.<eos> But we will.<eos> Now, please, work quickly. I need to get back to the bank.<eos> If you have ever been left out of an important conversation due to your age, then you know how the Baudelaires felt as they trudged up the stairs, unable to participate in the conversation that would determine their fate.
I don't work at a hedge fund, I don't work for a white-shoe law firm, I don't make superhero movies.<eos> I work for the President of the United States.<eos> When your ship's taking on water, you don't jump.<eos> I appreciate the concern.<eos> I love you guys. You know that. But I have to get back to the White House.
- Go to hell.<eos> - I'm on my way.<eos> You'll be registered under Michael and Elizabeth Connor.<eos> The staff you see when you get there will be the staff you see every day.<eos> Anything changes, we'll notify you.
Oh, you motherfuckers!<eos> Tony, come on.<eos> Okay. Okay.<eos> - Tony.<eos> - I'm gonna get you!
Dude. Wake up.<eos> Don't sleep. Don't sleep, Tony.<eos> Don't sleep.<eos> You better keep running!<eos> I see you!
- Sounds good. Let's do it.<eos> Let's move him, guys. Let's go.<eos> Leo and Anna Timblin.<eos> Welcome home.<eos> We've been expecting you.
Oh, Anna, we're home.<eos> So, we've received some files from Lilongwe, and there's no fear for contagion, but the doctors there suspected malaria, dysentery, hep "A," and larval infestations.<eos> I can feel things moving in my feet.<eos> Great. Okay.<eos> Uh, you guys were airlifted before all of the test results were back, but we should be receiving them shortly.
I think that Marilyn Monroe and the vulgarity of her clothing and pictures is ruining this great industry that I love.<eos> People don't want to see stars like Monroe in pictures.<eos> They want their stars to be wholesome, with good morals.<eos> Like me.<eos> That's not the only difference between you and her.
Excellent. When, uh, do you think you might decide?<eos> - Maybe next week.<eos> Wow. Gee, I'm sorry for any confusion, but I was talk... I was talking about, uh... a much shorter window for the thinking part.<eos> How short?<eos> We would have you on the air by 3:20 this afternoon.
The insurance industry is heavily regulated.<eos> I can think of a dozen infractions - right here off the top of my head. - Mr. McGill...<eos> You're hoping we'll either find another carrier or cut you an enormous check.<eos> Win-win for you!<eos> I assure you, neither is going to happen.
Around the clock, two shifts, five men, seven working graveyard.<eos> And look what our ARCTEK satellite picked up.<eos> Those must be Bray's men, so the boy's Anna's son.<eos> We have no idea what kind of eyes Bray has.<eos> He'll likely see you coming from any direction.
Just hold on.<eos> These two fine gentlemen, misters...<eos> Devon.<eos> Jimmy.<eos> Mr. Devon and Mr. Jimmy are here to protect you.
Think.<eos> You're not thinking.<eos> You got to make them believe you're too weak to do anything...<eos> Walk, talk, drink water, anything.<eos> That is when they decide to either bring you back from the brink...
Any private homes?<eos> Yeah, a couple.<eos> Did you tap some cougar ass this summer?<eos> You know what, I think that's more a fantasy from your wank-bank, Reggie.<eos> - I'll catch you guys soon.
Your eye.<eos> Now to kickoff this pep rally, i'd like to hand it over<eos> To our very own mayor mccoy.<eos> Thank you, principal weatherbee.<eos> It is heartening to see so many of you here, even in weather like this.
Call him if you want, but do it soon.<eos> His spots fill up fast.<eos> Thank you, Val.<eos> Hey, now you have zero excuse for avoiding music.<eos> Sorry to interrupt Sad Breakfast Club, but I'm here to formally invite you to
Thank you, Val.<eos> Hey, now you have zero excuse for avoiding music.<eos> Sorry to interrupt Sad Breakfast Club, but I'm here to formally invite you to<eos> Jason's memorial at Thornhill this weekend.<eos> To my surprise and chagrin, mother added you to the guest-list.
- General Tso's chicken, scallion pancakes, vegetable dumplings, family-style.<eos> What's wrong, son?<eos> Huh?<eos> Nothing. I'm just...<eos> I'm not used to coming home and seeing you guys together.
No...<eos> That's why your mom invited my dad and I to dinner?<eos> So these two could break into my his trailer while she interrogated him?<eos> No, I didn't know what they were doing.<eos> But yes, that is why she invited you guys.
- Yeah, so what?<eos> - "So what?"<eos> So, everything, starting with FP's confession, has a few gaping holes in it.<eos> He's being used by someone with a crazy motive, for example, hiding incest.<eos> You were disgusted that Jason and Polly were dating because they were related.
They lured us in here so Lon Scott can get a clear line of sight.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Lon Scott's set up on us. - You got to move.<eos> - Copy that.<eos> I'll get out of sight and guide you guys out.
It isn't counsel's place to assume facts not in evidence.<eos> Did you merely happen by the building on South...<eos> Counsel is leading the witness.<eos> And counsel forgets this is a preliminary hearing, not a trial.<eos> What brought you to that abandoned building on South Kimbark, Sergeant?
You're gettin' treatment.<eos> No.<eos> I'm not puttin' myself through it.<eos> Or my kids.<eos> It's months of pain and humiliation just so I can die anyway and leave you all in the poorhouse.
We have to take this to next level, and the next level is public protest.<eos> Anybody here who's uncomfortable with what we're gonna do tomorrow, you just get up and go.<eos> No judgment.<eos> All right?<eos> We'll still consider you all a part of the group.
I am Moregon, and we are the Kinnah.<eos> We come from the shadow side of this mountain.<eos> The water has gone dark, tainted by the lowlanders' road building.<eos> We've been searching for shelter.<eos> We beseech you.
Of course you are.<eos> You're that girl from the store.<eos> Yes, I am that girl from the store.<eos> Touché.<eos> So you two, like, a thing?
- Yes.<eos> "Personable" is a P word.<eos> That was flippant.<eos> Y'know, I didn't hire both of you recalcitrants just because you're good with computers.<eos> I hired you because you're waywards, and one of the ways I like to give back is by being a beacon with waywards.
We need to know how to get through the wall.<eos> I can't help you.<eos> The gateways are a very complex system.<eos> Lots of built-in redundancies.<eos> Even if I cleared you on my side, another officer would have to clear you through a second checkpoint.
Right here.<eos> You have been assigned to one of the Authority's labor camps and distribution centers.<eos> We are responsible for making sure supplies reach their correct destination.<eos> If you break a rule, if you steal anything...<eos> I will hurt you.
Judge sir...<eos> Sorry!<eos> Wrong adjective...<eos> Death penalty hasn't been abolished in India yet.<eos> I can't decide whether to throw you two out...or strangle you.
Just pay the man, Ralph.<eos> Threatening to bribe a police officer is a serious offence.<eos> I didn't. I told him to pay you.<eos> Now, excuse us. We've got a take to shoot.<eos> I may not be able to connect you to this pot, but consider this an informal caution.
Let him go now, George.<eos> Let me try to help Arthur.<eos> Arthur? Arthur, can you hear me?<eos> All right there, George.<eos> We'll get you out as soon as we can.
Discreetly collecting.<eos> You look fatigued.<eos> I rather needed some air.<eos> This is the Anschluss of Nonnatus, and we must simply sit it out and wait for Churchill.<eos> Now, of course, at the hospital, Nurse will provide you with sanitary napkins, breastpads, and clothes for baby.
Some of this is my fault.<eos> I said I wouldn't adopt from an orphanage.<eos> Didn't want a stranger's child.<eos> You live and learn, don't you?<eos> Mr Spenlow, I can introduce you to someone from an adoption agency. When the time is right.
So why haven't we encountered it before in our Muslim mothers?<eos> I've not seen it in any of our Sylheti ladies.<eos> I asked the same question.<eos> Apparently, the practice predates Islam, and prevalence varies depending on geography.<eos> I'll leave you to it.
The world is clamoring to know what the hell is going on, and we can't tell them.<eos> We can't tell them that the President of the United States has allowed his ex-mistress to brainwash him into thinking his former Chief of Staff is a murderer...<eos> - Watch yourself.<eos> - You are being played.<eos> This election is all about you.
This kid- - I'm telling you, he's not doing good.<eos> Hates it here more than me.<eos> His English sucks.<eos> He can barely talk to anyone at school.<eos> Anyway, I can get you in there pretty easy.
I'm not gonna be around when those things start spitting fire on King's Landing.<eos> I have to tell Cersei.<eos> May as well jump back in that river.<eos> I know what Cersei has told you.<eos> That I've come to destroy your cities, burn down your homes, murder you, and orphan your children.
I'm not beheading anyone.<eos> Your Grace.<eos> Lord Randyll Tarly, Dickon Tarly,<eos> I, Daenerys of House Targaryen, First of My Name,<eos> Breaker of Chains, and Mother of Dragons, sentence you to die.
Where's the rest of them?<eos> If we wait long enough we will find out.<eos> Go back to Eastwatch.<eos> Get a raven to Daenerys, tell her what's happened.<eos> - I'm not leaving you.
Emergency evac.<eos> Get the chopper now.<eos> Get out of here!<eos> Arias.<eos> Thanks to you, I'll have to move my business somewhere else.
Are you sure about that?<eos> Shut up!<eos> My partner, he's not just some kind of paramedic.<eos> He's an ex-Marine, a trained killer.<eos> And he'll send every last one of you guys to hell before he deserts that kid.
Don't study too hard.<eos> Yeah, you're the poor schmuck taking the high school equivalency.<eos> Drive safely.<eos> - I will.<eos> It was so good having you two under one roof.
We're going to circle the block and park in that alley over there.<eos> Then what?<eos> Smoke 'em if you've got 'em.<eos> Those people looking for you and Holden,<eos> - I think they found you.
But I'll be honest with you, It's pretty rough out there right now.<eos> I'll tell you what, on my trip, I got a lot clarity about a lot of things.<eos> And one of those things. Is that what we have here is a beautiful album.<eos> And I wanna release another single right away.<eos> I mean, I wanna get eyes and ears on you.
I'm looking for the exes.<eos> You guys don't look much like exes to me.<eos> We have one of my favorite acts in the world here today...<eos> The exes, hot off your tour with autumn chase. So good to see you.<eos> Great to have you in the studio.
- Oh, that's nice.<eos> - Is it?<eos> Where'd you meet him?<eos> Work or...<eos> Mom, Dad, I love you.
In fact, today I thought I'd just get some establishing shots.<eos> Yeah, and I think we're gonna set some limitations, too.<eos> We won't shoot anything in the bedroom, and I think, you know, the TV room should be off-limits.<eos> And dinner and nothing with the girls, of course.<eos> So when will I film you?
- It was a departure for me, too, and I think Scarlett was a real revelation.<eos> She took it to the next level.<eos> Yeah, Scarlett, what was that like for you, I mean, revealing so much of yourself?<eos> Well, I had to try and understand the person I was playing and find a part of me that could relate to her.<eos> Don't let her fool you.
Yeah.<eos> It's exciting.<eos> But how are you?<eos> How's writing with Deacon?<eos> I haven't seen you.
Stupid idea. I shouldn't have done that.<eos> - Oh, it's fine.<eos> - You meant well.<eos> - Hi. - It's good to see you.<eos> - You too.
Because what you do like the textures, the sounds...<eos> No.<eos> It's your voice, it's your songs.<eos> All I was doing was moving the faders...<eos> You know, I'm just gonna leave you guys to it while I go pick up our daughter.
Shut up.<eos> Will... there's only you.<eos> Hi!<eos> Welcome, everybody!<eos> Good to see you all.
We hear one of your amazing songs.<eos> A voice says, "The Exes.<eos> Country music's favorite on-again, off-again couple."<eos> An unopened box gets brought into the room.<eos> And we see you in sped-up motion easily assemble this brand new dining room table.
Who was driving the car that killed Scott Lockhart?<eos> As far as I know, Noah was.<eos> He basically stood up in that court, and he volunteered to go to prison.<eos> Well, it's really great to finally meet you, Vik.<eos> Well, I'm happy to meet you guys, too.
Only weak men harbor regrets.<eos> I'm giving you an opportunity to explain yourself... To help me understand why you thought you could lure me into a cage and get away with it.<eos> It won't spare you my wrath. It won't prevent me from ravaging everything that you hold dear. But I may exhibit an ounce of mercy when I take your life.<eos> Tough talk from someone who sat quietly in a chair waiting for daddy to come home from work.<eos> Or I could kill you now.
If she's telling America to unite and support the Republican ticket... and her husband... that will send a signal to the Democrats to get on board.<eos> Plus, you're glamorous, attractive, in love...<eos> The perfect couple. That's political money.<eos> That's a political lie.<eos> People like to see you two together. It makes them happy.
About equality, not bigotry. About love, not hate.<eos> About hope, not fear.<eos> Thank you for thinking we can really be a nation of the people, by the people and for the people.<eos> IHoy si somos una nación de la gente, por la gente, y para toda la gente!<eos> God bless you. And may God bless these United States of America.

For richer, for poorer...<eos> In sickness and in health...<eos> To love and to cherish...<eos> - Till death do us part. - Till death do us part.<eos> I now pronounce you husband and wife.
- The suit feeds...<eos> - All lost with your team.<eos> Under the mirror arrays.<eos> Gunny, you're the only one who survived, our only eyes and ears on what happened down there.<eos> Now, you said that you were under attack.
Six blues.<eos> They were coming right at us.<eos> Then we got jammed, I...<eos> I grabbed Travis and we made a line.<eos> - Six blues charging you?
Your reported shots fired from the un line, then?<eos> Seven blues were charging at us, about two klicks out.<eos> Then we got jammed.<eos> I grabbed Travis and we formed a line.<eos> So, seven un marines started charging and shooting at you?
Not in front of the guests.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, a moment, please.<eos> For those of you who have been rudely awakened, I apologise.<eos> And for those still to go to bed, you also have my sympathies.<eos> But I assure you, this is the safest place to be in the city.
Yourself?<eos> A junior researcher at Oxford.<eos> Fairly dull, I'm afraid, as I imagine my father would be happy to tell you.<eos> Now, now, Toby. I'm sure you're doing important work. Ahem.<eos> I'm sorry, gentlemen, I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
- ♪ Lambda lambda phi till we die ♪ - louder!<eos> With more enthusiasm!<eos> Y'all sound like a bunch of weak-ass puppies!<eos> ♪ Lambda lambda phi till we die ♪<eos> Now show me what you got!
Even doors have been ripped off.<eos> Your servants gone.<eos> Your orchard's plundered. There's...<eos> There's nothing. And...<eos> The soldiers who were there, who came there to collect you, they were...
I have stolen your secret, Fred Johnson.<eos> And I am giving it to the belt.<eos> Now the time.<eos> Other ship come, take you load for earth, for Mars.<eos> They take you, okay?
Get up!<eos> All inners, this way.<eos> Time to go.<eos> Inners only.<eos> Good ship gonna take you home, yeah?
Does it make you happy to know there's more of that stuff out there?<eos> If it is, it is.<eos> It's better to know.<eos> Tell me.<eos> Did Fred ever do you wrong?
Once I'm there, I'm gonna tuck her behind one of those 71 cute little moons.<eos> And then I'll wait.<eos> So if anything goes south down there, y'all just holler, cavalry will come running.<eos> I'll quietly de-orbit, no burn, hug the surface, and we'll rendezvous at one of these service airlocks here.<eos> I'll scoop you up and we'll strap in for a max-burn up and out.
See if you can get the flight controls back up.<eos> Okay.<eos> Please...<eos> Go!<eos> Or I'll call the Harbor Master, or the Martians, or whoever it takes to make you leave!
- How does 75 mil sound?<eos> - Good afternoon, Mr. And Ms. Stroblekowitz.<eos> How're y'all doing today?<eos> - Very well, thank you.<eos> - Mr. Beeker's ready for you.
- Good afternoon, Mr. And Ms. Stroblekowitz.<eos> How're y'all doing today?<eos> - Very well, thank you.<eos> - Mr. Beeker's ready for you.<eos> Flynn'll be taking you upstairs.
- We represent Mr. Rose's interests.<eos> - Yes, Mr. Beeker.<eos> - Cherry, can you send Paul in, please?<eos> - Right away.<eos> I didn't expect you so soon.
I'm so happy to be back here with you.<eos> Yeah, me too.<eos> I thought I was gonna go crazy without you.<eos> Good to see you. - Good to see you.<eos> - Thank you so much.
- All of them, but the guests aren't in at this time of day.<eos> - The hell's going on?<eos> - It sounds like a hammering.<eos> Hey, are you the police?<eos> Oh, thank God, someone finally called you.
Open the door.<eos> You... you... you don't understand, it'll kill me!<eos> No-no-no, no, no-no-no-no.<eos> No, he'll come for me!<eos> He'll come for you!
He won't let you sleep!<eos> Calm down, calm down.<eos> No one's gonna hurt you.<eos> No, you can't hide from him!<eos> He finds you wherever you are!
Oh, my God.<eos> - Hope it was worth it.<eos> - It wasn't.<eos> Your creation is out of control.<eos> Thought it might be a good idea to warn you.
50 when you bring me their names.<eos> It will take time. Go home. I'll send you word.<eos> I am not be leaving Roscoff until I have a list.<eos> Then you must be on your guard, monsieur.<eos> Every hour you remain puts you in greater danger.
In which case, may I ask what your business is here?<eos> For lest you're unaware, this is Nampara land.<eos> And it appears you're trespassing.<eos> As a magistrate, no doubt you're aware of the penalty for such a crime?<eos> I advise you remove yourselves or I'll call back the soldiers you sent and have you both arrested.
And what shoots they be?<eos> Winter primroses.<eos> Well, Ross.<eos> My compliments to the Volunteers. I believe they were put to good use today.<eos> Oh, did you think you were being summoned to fight the Frenchies?
Now?<eos> No, you do it in the morning.<eos> You're okay, though?<eos> Just at work.<eos> Just working late, and I was thinking about you, and I want you to know... that I love you very much, kiddo, okay?
You were struggling before she left.<eos> And at noon today, the whole world is going to know that you suffered another blow.<eos> The only thing the world's gonna know is, Jessica had such confidence in our abilities that she decided to move on to another phase of her career.<eos> I don't care how you want to spin it.<eos> Even if you manage to keep your clients, you've got a boulder headed your way, and you know it.
Then you're even less prepared to be a leader than I thought, because your partner's out there coming after my firm, and you don't even know it!<eos> Maybe Louis wouldn't be doing that if you hadn't come here with some bullshit merger designed to rip us apart.<eos> Are you really that stupid?<eos> Are you really telling me that isn't what you wanted?<eos> If I wanted to rip you apart, you'd be in million pieces right now, because Jessica is gone, and you're not in my league.
Either way, like I said, Ms. Zane's interview is in two weeks.<eos> - reckless endangerment?<eos> Is this a joke?<eos> - I guarantee you, Sofia price isn't laughing.<eos> - Well, any judge in his right mind is gonna laugh you out of court, because you don't understand the law.
But I can tell you how to get to the ocean.<eos> I don't have any scrip.<eos> You're Martian, aren't you?<eos> That obvious?<eos> Well, I've seen a few of you over the years, being how close we are to the UN.
_<eos> Eleanor, come on in.<eos> You, Eleanor Shellstrop, are dead.<eos> Cool.<eos> You know the way you feel when you see a chimpanzee and a baby tiger who've become friends?
What?<eos> But I thought that you said-- I don't care what you thought.<eos> This isn't "Westworld." I can't make her human.<eos> Benjamin, I'm not asking you to make her human.<eos> I'm just asking you to give her a little compassion.
And another for the way back, and it weighed much less.<eos> By about 550 pounds.<eos> That's 100 pounds each for three bales of pot.<eos> And 250 pounds for felix, who you intended to leave behind.<eos> This murder was premeditated by both of you.
The pair of them are lying through their teeth.<eos> Right, now, here we are.<eos> Now, you told me you hadn't seen Kelly for a couple of months.<eos> That's right.<eos> But the pair of you were caught on CCTV threatening Nathan Weaver, who you said you didn't know, the day before he disappeared.
- You coming or what? - Ma'am!<eos> You've known Nathan Weaver for over 13 years.<eos> Yeah, I knew him.<eos> Him and every chancer that ever walked through that door.<eos> The pair of you were questioned over a series of burglaries.
We're not killing him.<eos> Yeah, you're probably right.<eos> For some reason, he's of value to Marcel.<eos> - Kol, would you...?<eos> - Happy to stay and have a drink and eviscerate anyone who tries to follow you.
All because you can.<eos> But here's the other truth.<eos> Despite being raised by you people... I am nothing like any of you.<eos> In fact, I'm proud as hell I'm not a Mikaelson.<eos> I beat you all without turning into you.
You don't think my baby killed that girl?<eos> No.<eos> But we think he might know who did.<eos> And the longer he stays out there, the more he does begin to look like a suspect.<eos> I let you in here, but you need a warrant if you're gonna search my house.
- Rest of the beating was bonus.<eos> - Could you give us a range?<eos> Died between 7:00 P.M. and 11:00.<eos> This the tox?<eos> Yeah, you might find it interesting.
People might get the wrong idea.<eos> And talk.<eos> - Let's get out of here.<eos> - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, slow down,<eos> - 'cause you don't want me to chase you.
May I introduce my friend and governess to our child, Madame Scarron.<eos> Welcome to Versailles.<eos> If you will excuse me...<eos> God, it reeks in here!<eos> Would it kill you to open a window?
Closer!<eos> Closer!<eos> Satan!<eos> If anyone here present knows a good reason why these two should not be joined in Holy Matrimony, let him declare it now.<eos> I hereby pronounce you man and wife.
Beauty? Wit?<eos> Refinement?<eos> Intelligence?<eos> You are the cream of the French aristocracy, and the envy of every court in Europe.<eos> But when I look at you,
- There you go.<eos> - No, we need that money.<eos> This is a shakedown.<eos> He's a crook. And right when our app was getting off the ground.<eos> That's how he found you.
Yeah, yeah, for a second there, he wasn't buying it, and then I just started babbling on about tech specs until his eyes glazed over.<eos> Well, as a result, we now have a perpetual royalty-free license for the patent.<eos> Yes!<eos> See?<eos> I stuck to my guns and as a result, we now have 20 grand we would have otherwise lost if I had listened to you delicate little snowflakes and settled.
You'll be able to have a conversation. With your daughter again.<eos> A conversation?<eos> With my little girl?<eos> Thank you.<eos> We'll give you time alone with your daughter now.
Is that a Hex Mag?<eos> It's not really something the Secret Service uses, but it's a favorite among the Watchdogs.<eos> Guess it's not just a theory after all.<eos> These men are simply providing security.<eos> The world has become a very dangerous place because of people like you.
On our way.<eos> Welcome to the inside of my mind, Sheeple.<eos> You guys watching any, uh, any good programming lately?<eos> You know why they call it "programming," right?<eos> Because you're being programmed through little screens, big screens, little morphine drips of sequels and prequels and zombies and Kanyes,
Billy. Thank God you're okay.<eos> You're still a sheep, though.<eos> You're all sheep!<eos> Well, the Quinjet's ready when you are.<eos> We'll get you home safely.
That's where I programmed the backdoor to get out.<eos> And listen, living in there too long may kill you, but dying in there will definitely kill you, so... be careful.<eos> You, too.<eos> And remember, even if our vitals are going haywire, do not ...<eos> Do not pull you out or wake you up, I know.
- Honestly, is this really necessary?<eos> I'm Jeffrey Mace.<eos> Welcome to S.H.I.E.L.D.<eos> Sorry about the hoods, but trust is a luxury these days.<eos> That being said, Ward vouched for you, so I'm happy to provide you sanctuary.
- He's gonna kill her.<eos> - Fitz would never do that.<eos> - Are you sure?<eos> Get back to the Quintjet.<eos> I'll deal with this and meet you there.
My father's son.<eos> I thought his presence is what you'd have wished for.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I was just programmed to make you happy.<eos> To make all of you happy.
Kyle, these are my friends Hope and Shaun.<eos> - It's so nice to finally meet...<eos> - I'm going on for hugs.<eos> - Oh. Okay. - Get over here.<eos> I've heard so much about you both.
I don't blame you.<eos> I am a fascinating man.<eos> But the question is, why should I be interested in you?<eos> Because the king still listens to me.<eos> I could... persuade him to listen to you.
They were dirty women.<eos> They were sluts.<eos> But you are special girls.<eos> Fertility is a gift directly from God.<eos> He left you intact for a Biblical purpose.
This disgusting creature has given us no choice.<eos> Am I correct, girls?<eos> Yes, Aunt Lydia.<eos> Offred. But that is not the worst of it.<eos> Now, you know that I do my very best to protect you.
I know things got heated between us the other night, but as far as I'm concerned, it's water under the bridge, so if you're wondering if I'm still upset at you...<eos> I'm not.<eos> And this is to make sure you're still not upset with me after you hear what I'm about to say.<eos> Why am I holding a check for $500,000?<eos> Because I've decided to go back to Pearson Specter Litt, and I gave you my word that I wouldn't leave you high and dry.
Now, girls.<eos> Soon you will be leaving us for new homes, a new family.<eos> And they won't judge you for your looks, or your clothes, or your ability to sound clever.<eos> Take your hands out of your mouth!<eos> They will love you for the blessing only you can provide.
Ants Away, Ants Be Gone, Fuck You, Ants.<eos> Fuck You, Ants.<eos> You people need to take this more seriously.<eos> You never want a sloppy kill.<eos> You leave anything behind, it's gonna come back and bite you in the ass.
- No one told me that. Just like no one told me that you can't fire him because that'll make you look weak.<eos> Which is why you took this meeting. Because you didn't want him taking it without you.<eos> - Okay, how in the hell are you doing all this?<eos> - I'm doing this because I'm Donna. And if it hasn't dawned on you already, so is this device.<eos> Now, do you wanna puff up your chest and play office politics, or do you wanna hear about an opportunity that could vault you both to the top of the ladder?
I remember when they were just little bundles of meat, screaming till I thought I'd go crazy.<eos> That's what kids do.<eos> You ever worry you just might snap?<eos> No.<eos> I heard that about you Oil War vets.
Belonged to her mother before Willa was even born.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> Because she's my daughter.<eos> So you see, I've got just as much at stake as you do.<eos> You and Arthur, you don't care who you hurt.
I got visas.<eos> US passport doesn't mean shit anymore. Bud. That's over.<eos> So, we just wait? Yup.<eos> I'll be back.<eos> And then we will get you all safe and sound to the magical land of the north.
Ooh! Look at that method.<eos> Very nice, I wonder who taught you that?<eos> Nobody taught me it. I just...<eos> You just came up with it?<eos> I'm watching you.
I'm a friend. Don't move.<eos> Don't move.<eos> Easy. You guys are from Boston.<eos> I heard it on my scanner.<eos> They're looking for you.
That's what makes it a play and not some processed rubbish we spoon-feed an audience. Now back to one!<eos> Look, we love the writing.<eos> It's dense and complex, and it constantly makes you think.<eos> But if you're gonna ask the audience to do the work, don't you have to reward them? I'm not asking them to work for it.<eos> I'm asking you. I am telling you.
When we searched your squat, we found a large quantity of drugs and £235 in cash.<eos> Was that connected to the deal you were doing with Julie Ann Collins and Eddie Phillips?<eos> We know Eddie was there.<eos> We found his fingerprints on your door.<eos> I suggest this Eddie chap broke in, planted the drugs and money and then informed you.
- Abort, abort, abort. - What?<eos> What the... What are you...<eos> Here you go, piggies.<eos> Some slop for you.<eos> Gotta fatten you up for the slaughter.
Viva la gnocca! Shut your mouth!<eos> Get out of here!<eos> Ladies, I know you're angry.<eos> And I'm angry, too.<eos> I'm pleading with you to just stop this.
Great, so we don't even rate a semiautomatic.<eos> Let's go.<eos> She's deadweight.<eos> I'll tell MCC... about the dead guard.<eos> I heard you in the stall.
Oh, God.<eos> Oh, thank Christ.<eos> Please help me.<eos> Oh, you girls gotta help me.<eos> Oh, I'm so glad to see you.
But you likely have no such responsibilities...<eos> - Dimoclat... - And should escape from this sad story...<eos> - Demcaca...<eos> - before another storm of melancholy<eos> - engulfs you in dampness and misery. - Dock.
Well, I don't have time to learn things.<eos> The banking day has already begun.<eos> In any case, I'm sure you'll be off on some exciting adventure with your new guardian.<eos> Remember, you can always rely on us at Mulctuary Money Management.<eos> Now, if you'll excuse me, I will leave you alone on this mostly deserted dock to await for your taxi to your Aunt Josephine's house.
My second favorite candy when I was a boy.<eos> You can eat them in the taxi on the way to meet your dowager aunt.<eos> - What's that?<eos> - Oh, Violet, I'm surprised at you.<eos> A girl your age should know that a taxi is a car that takes you someplace for a reasonable fee.
The knob could shatter into a million pieces and hit your eyes!<eos> Lake Lachrymose.<eos> I know every island in its waters and every cave along its shores.<eos> But now I can only stand to look at it from far away.<eos> That's why I couldn't meet you on the docks.
One, yes, a great deal of limes at a reasonable price.<eos> It's perfect for cold lime stew.<eos> The other is even better.<eos> Something wonderful.<eos> Baudelaires, I know I am a disappointment to you and to countless others.
We think he was killed because he possessed a piece of the Spear.<eos> What do you know about the JSA's final mission?<eos> Obsidian told me that the JSA disappeared after a trip to Leipzig in 1956.<eos> The mission was to recover the Spear of Destiny, and keep it from falling into enemy hands.<eos> And how was it that you were all scattered throughout time?
It seems your wizard is too late.<eos> Is she talking about Professor Stein?<eos> No matter.<eos> We shall settle this at the point of our swords.<eos> Camelot calls to you in its hour of need.
They're telling me.<eos> - Psychically.<eos> - Then you have to remain here.<eos> If you go outside, you're vulnerable.<eos> I can't put you all in danger.
No, I can't.<eos> There's some kind of psychic interference.<eos> Well, that's convenient.<eos> He's after me.<eos> I should turn myself over. Maybe he'll let you go.
Anyway, we have to get...<eos> Son, you can't leave.<eos> We've searched the stars to find you.<eos> And we must get to know Kara as well.<eos> And I would love to know more about you.
You lie to me? You die.<eos> And your brother watches.<eos> Hey, you're gonna have to go through me first, buddy.<eos> I don't deal with human criminals.<eos> You break too easily.
I'm sure there's a good reason she's not here.<eos> It's okay, Alex.<eos> No, it's...<eos> Look, I feel bad.<eos> I can see it was an awkward thing that I pushed you into and now...
We have crossed a sea of stars in order to bring you a new way.<eos> A better way.<eos> I will be your Queen,<eos> and you will be my subjects.<eos> Obey our orders, and we will protect you.
Our leader-of-the-free-world Olivia is an alien.<eos> Okay, come on.<eos> The President is not an alien...<eos> Oh, my God, the President is an alien!<eos> I assume that you are all a little frightened, but I assure you, I mean you no harm.
So good.<eos> You know what I just realized?<eos> The first time we met was when the President got attacked.<eos> Makes this kind of a full circle thing for us.<eos> Though there are many stars in our celestial kingdom, only one will lead you down the correct path.
The first time we met was when the President got attacked.<eos> Makes this kind of a full circle thing for us.<eos> Though there are many stars in our celestial kingdom, only one will lead you down the correct path.<eos> Each of you have found your star.<eos> And so, in my power as acting regent of the Daxamite Empire, it is my duty and my honor to proclaim you...
Tonight, I can only suspect Congress will spend a dark night of the soul, after which they will reconsider their paralysis and choose to act.<eos> Capital East Telecom has informed me that it's repairing the network as fast as possible, but that it will take at least a couple more days to be fully restored.<eos> It is an unfortunate but undeniable fact that we will continue to experience attacks until ICO and other terrorist groups like it are eliminated swiftly and completely.<eos> Thank you.<eos> May God bless you. And may God bless the United States of America.
As it includes my daughter.<eos> She is my heart and soul.<eos> Right now she's out there, alone in the darkness, fighting.<eos> We can't give up.<eos> So I'm begging you...
Here's a proposal.<eos> You come with me, I surrender the only weapon that can take your life.<eos> We need your blood.<eos> That's funny, I didn't hear you say "please."<eos> If you want answers, we have to guide you to the Ancestors.
- We need to bend the rules.<eos> - How?<eos> - Simple loophole.<eos> You're both bound by blood to a New Orleans witch.<eos> We can use the link to your child to cast a spell and link you to an audience with the dead.
I wasn't sure you were gonna show up.<eos> Well, I'm full of surprises.<eos> I hope you intend to make our trip worth the effort.<eos> As a matter of fact, I do.<eos> And you are gonna listen to every single word I have to say, because right now, I'm the only thing standing between you and the Hollow.
Who's the irresponsible one that's gonna burn through theirs in, like, five years?<eos> They're gonna come asking you for a little bit of yours and what are you gonna tell that person? Hmm?<eos> You gonna tell them, "No"?<eos> What happens then?<eos> Do they threaten to rat you out for stealing the money and killing me?
It doesn't matter who put it there.<eos> What matters is that they found it.<eos> They think you killed Greg to protect Tommy.<eos> I think they're gonna try and prove that Tommy is Ghost so they can make this whole thing a RICO.<eos> Or prosecute both of you guys under the Kingpin Statute.
Cheers.<eos> May the sun shine warm upon your face.<eos> May the rain fall soft upon the fields.<eos> And until we meet again...<eos> May God hold you in the palm of his hand.
"and 100 pieces of gold."<eos> The problem is magic haddock, like robots, don't think like people.<eos> The fisherman's son came home from the war in a coffin and the King sent 100 gold pieces in recognition of his heroic death.<eos> The fisherman had one wish left.<eos> What do you think he wished for?
They are, as of now, the indigenous life form.<eos> You'd best make friends with them because there's loads of them, and they're the only ones who know how anything works.<eos> They killed our people.<eos> Well, look, they have forgotten about that.<eos> They've forgotten about you, they've forgotten that you even made them in the first place.
No, to the steel mill, sir.<eos> Hampton is code for the steel mill.<eos> - Code, sir?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Yes, we need to use code, otherwise anyone could walk in here and get you blabbing like a fool.
We need to buy in bulk, increase our margins.<eos> We see college campuses as our next frontier.<eos> Hangover central, you know?<eos> And since we can show that our product enhances performance, the fitness industry is logical, too.<eos> I could put you guys in front of the money for a round of meetings.
Our kind was being hunted.<eos> The human commander made me an offer I knew you would never agree to.<eos> With wicked tongue... the serpent lied and took their liberty.<eos> Through poison words, the world knew sin.<eos> Our hand will set you free.
Movies, as in moving pictures?<eos> In your time, it was a kinetoscope cinematic device.<eos> It's evolved a lot since then.<eos> Ms. Anders, your appointment is waiting.<eos> I'll leave you to it, then.
Detective babineaux?<eos> I just got a report from a woman about a pimp yelling at a hooker in a car.<eos> Meaning us?<eos> You have been snippy with me.<eos> Yeah, well, she said she'd been watching you two parked here all night.
- I hope it's a book burning.<eos> - Fingers crossed.<eos> Hi, everyone.<eos> Uh, thank you for bringing your books.<eos> In honor of Poussey, I'd like to welcome you all to the new Litchfield Community Library.
Quit the bitching, please.<eos> Try to remember, you are federal inmates, not line cooks at Applebee's.<eos> Now there's a new shipment of produce out on the loading dock that is not gonna move itself.<eos> Rosado, Hernandez, bring the boxes back in, and you're done for the day.<eos> CO Samuelson will escort you back to your block.
We was just wrestling.<eos> You want a turn?<eos> I mean, we loosened him up real good.<eos> Everybody knows that puto loves to fuck for cash or whatever you got laying around.<eos> I will destroy you.
- Oh. Suzanne.<eos> Suzanne, I'm gonna need you to calm down, all right?<eos> You're a liar, liar, pants on fire!<eos> You've all been fed a bunch of lies.<eos> I mean, they wanna put labels on you, like crazy, psycho, deranged stalker.
- Blanca, you'll carry the torch, yes?<eos> - Actually, Red, I'm pretty tired.<eos> All right, let's pretend we're at a Jewish wedding, right?<eos> One, two, three!<eos> I hate all of you.
Even technology has become a weapon in their hands used to poison our minds.<eos> I know you're in pain.<eos> I know you're afraid, but it doesn't have to be like this.<eos> There is a way out of the darkness.<eos> I can show it to you.
In order to ensure public safety, the government has declared a state of emergency and security forces will be given increased powers to deal with the crisis.<eos> And a curfew will be enforced at sunset.<eos> These measures are not permanent.<eos> They will be an inconvenience.<eos> However, I believe they are necessary, and they should demonstrate to you that this government will spare no effort to protect you and to protect our way of life.
I really didn't wanna do this again, but, um... I need you guys to...<eos> wire me $200 so they don't turn off my phone... and so I can eat.<eos> I'm really sorry.<eos> I swear this is the last time.<eos> I love you.
No.<eos> I still have that important piece of yours in play.<eos> We'll absolve you from the hit that you did on that girl.<eos> Well, then... I think we're close to an agreement.<eos> I just need that small piece of information... the anonymous tip that brought you to my door.
And I think it's about damn time I pick up a sword for my brother.<eos> So I will make you this vow.<eos> If you let Wallace out, I promise he will never be back in here again.<eos> Parole is about second chances, right?<eos> I'm asking you to give me a second chance to be a better brother.
All Woz was trying to do was help me.<eos> Help all of us, same as he's always done.<eos> When the FBI picked me up after the heist, I was convinced that there was no way out.<eos> That we were all going to jail.<eos> I turned myself inside out looking to keep you guys free of it.
No. That kind of lapse?<eos> Every day I show up because I know we're stronger as a unit than we are by ourselves.<eos> Our team is being hunted right now, and we're running out of time.<eos> So you're coming back with me to the station, and you're gonna do your job.<eos> And if I have to take you back in cuffs, I will.
He's untouchable.<eos> What kind of dirt?<eos> He's got bank records.<eos> He's got photos.<eos> He's got recordings on senators, on judges, on you.
I can't tell you how important that is to getting us both what we want.<eos> And what is that?<eos> For me and my associates here to hit the bricks.<eos> Better not wait.<eos> Spiga's coming and they're gonna send you back to Inazagi in a box.
We paid you to put this stuff inside the house.<eos> It's of no use to me out here.<eos> Like I said before, sir, we weren't contracted to move<eos> - anyone else's furniture out.<eos> - Right, "contracted." In the history of moving, have you ever been contracted to drop someone's shit on the front yard?
- Yeah. Preach to the other ones.<eos> Talk about the scourge of drugs or give the forgiveness sermon.<eos> Or just keep saying whatever you've been saying.<eos> Just keep saying it.<eos> Otherwise they're gonna come after you, and you, and then my family is next.
- For me?<eos> - I'm gonna get you boys some lemonade.<eos> - Just stay right here.<eos> - I know what you're doing.<eos> I'm not here to judge you for it, but I can't participate in it either.
We're talking about a potential murder here.<eos> If you're connected in any way... it's my duty. I'm gonna have to bring you in.<eos> Absolutely. Absolutely it is.<eos> I passed Martin Byrde on the road coming in.<eos> So... what sort of business you have with him?
What the fuck is your problem, man?<eos> Y'all got to go.<eos> - Screw you.<eos> - You don't want me to come out.<eos> I will fuck you up, baldy. And you, Gregg Allman.
Monty, it's too risky.<eos> Jasper was right.<eos> You're not God.<eos> I have an announcement to make.<eos> Clarke Griffin has been lying to you.
The drones are protecting ALIE'S facilities like guard dogs.<eos> Can you stop them?<eos> We need you, Abby. Yeah.<eos> There must be a way.<eos> We can see you.
Two bouquets a week. Bleeding us dry.<eos> If my sweeteners aren't sweet enough, maybe we should just call it a day.<eos> You've only got a few months left on your sentence.<eos> You can do that standing on your head.<eos> Oi! You lot! Can it or I'll stripe the lot of ya!
Do you trust Father John with our gold, Al?<eos> I don't trust anyone with that gold, Billy.<eos> Until we can move it, better the devil we know?<eos> Comes from the Lord! He who keeps you will not slumber.<eos> The Lord will keep you from all evil.
- It's a nice place.<eos> - Tick tock.<eos> - Dude, are you okay?<eos> - I'm fine. - Nothing to see here.<eos> - Using the gold you procured, we have been able to amply fund the infantry.
- Well, I really want magic, so, yeah.<eos> - But to pay for it with servitude to a lying drunkard...<eos> - what's the alternative?<eos> - Us.<eos> - You?
Previously on x company...<eos> Sometimes, Your friend is a mole.<eos> You might have to kill someone you know.<eos> The rendezvous is set.<eos> Your contacts are expecting you.
There's a train monday morning. I filed the transport memorandum myself.<eos> I didn't realize at the time;<eos> It's going to the camps. We will be on it,<eos> Whether I say something or not.<eos> I'll come back for you.
I didn't realize at the time;<eos> It's going to the camps. We will be on it,<eos> Whether I say something or not.<eos> I'll come back for you.<eos> I'll get you out, all of you.
Please, Byron.<eos> By... Chief, we're done here.<eos> Too bad!<eos> I got something to say.<eos> Now, I've known you all for nearly a lifetime.
Too bad!<eos> I got something to say.<eos> Now, I've known you all for nearly a lifetime.<eos> Keeping you safe... has been more than a job to me.<eos> But now, I can't save you people from what I know is coming.
You just had to let him save you, huh?<eos> You're such a girl.<eos> You know, I would like to see you dead regardless of your gender. Shut up.<eos> Both of you.<eos> I'm gonna take you someplace safe, but if I have to shoot you to get you there,
My ass still hurts.<eos> Enough!<eos> Listen.<eos> I can't stop the curse, so the plan is we're gonna let it run its course.<eos> By killing you.
Potassium chloride will shut down the heart.<eos> Adrenaline will kick-start it.<eos> You die.<eos> Curse ends.<eos> I revive you.
Shit.<eos> Why don't you and Alice come join me?<eos> You're weaker.<eos> And you're down six fingers.<eos> More than enough to kill you both.
Or maybe not.<eos> Get yourself together, Will.<eos> I'll see you in a bit.<eos> Are you ready... to catch me?<eos> Doug, LeAnn... do you have a moment?
2028.<eos> 2032.<eos> 2036.<eos> One nation... Underwood.<eos> Doug, LeAnn... do you have a moment?
Aargh!<eos> I'm stopping. Stopping.<eos> Oh, Lord, that is not right, is it?<eos> As I got going for the second time, I realised I'd been a bit of a chump.<eos> The mistake I've made, of course, is that I've introduced you to this car before I've really tested it.
It's not soccer!<eos> It's football that we play!<eos> It's 6.75 billion people in the world call it football!<eos> You can moan and shout all you like.<eos> The fact is, we're British and we edit this show, and you'll just get cut out.
So, what we have here is a car that's fast, sounds good and is great fun in the corners.<eos> But there's something else very important about the 124.<eos> I don't know that there's really a million miles of difference between this and the mx-5.<eos> But everything I do in this car I'm doing in an Italian sports car.<eos> And it is impossible for that not to put you in a good mood.
Oh, when do you decide which one of us replaces Agent Jaqobis?<eos> No one replaces John Jaqobis.<eos> Thank you, Dutch.<eos> Arriving at research facility.<eos> Look, do well down there, Turin will clear you for special field work.
We know that someone killed the plasma on Arkyn.<eos> But not all the Hullen in the Quad were Arkyn born, and the rest of us?<eos> We're hiding.<eos> We're preparing.<eos> And then we're coming for you.
- to deactivate the seeds.<eos> - How the hells do we do that?<eos> We're still stuck here.<eos> Not if you release the emergency lever.<eos> The gravitational pull of the loading dock should pull you out of range.
- Yeah, and crash to our death.<eos> - Not necessarily.<eos> - Well, that's comforting.<eos> - Lucy, a little help.<eos> The density of the loading dock gives it three times the gravitational force of the sun, which will get you out of range in 10.2 seconds.
You can still save them.<eos> Friends, Unseeing, it's been a long, hard road, and now it appears it'll be a little bit longer.<eos> - This woman is a false prophet.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> She's tempting you, but you are strong.
Remember, jab and stab to the brain pan.<eos> Aren't they still Killjoys?<eos> These are not your friends.<eos> These are not your coworkers.<eos> They're an alien bug who will kill you and wear your body like a sweater.
Someone cut the feeds.<eos> We've lost eyes.<eos> Make it quick.<eos> Bad day at the office, huh?<eos> A Squad, we can't hear you.
I'm not sparring with you!<eos> I have an idea.<eos> Does it involve me being oconspirator in a plot to plant a human fingernail in Two's dinner?<eos> No.<eos> I think I figured out a way to convince you that what I'm saying is happening to me - is really happening to me. - Okay.
I was wondering, could we try something?<eos> Shouldn't you be checking for compatibility?<eos> My nanites should be able to handle any potential complications, including, if I'm right, the tumor.<eos> There.<eos> I can offer you a tour of the facility while I'm neurally monitoring her.
- Are you on your way back?<eos> Not yet.<eos> Do you want me to distract them?<eos> Have they shown any interest in you?<eos> So far, they're only focused on you.
- Can you remove it? - No...<eos> - But I can shut it down.<eos> - You can?<eos> You're all variations of my original design.<eos> Nobody knows you better than I do.
- I know, we're...<eos> - Life support took a hit.<eos> Oxygen is running out.<eos> We've got maybe 40 minutes left.<eos> We'll come get you before that happens.
You still awake?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Just wanted to say you'll never know how truly sorry I am.<eos> For what?<eos> Betraying you. Turning you all in.
Go ahead.<eos> Ishida research facility, this is the Raza.<eos> Your weapons are down and you're at our mercy.<eos> Open your main shuttle bay so we can board.<eos> If you don't comply, we will destroy you.
I won't try anything. I promise.<eos> You're just gonna have to hold it.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Glad to see you guys.
We need you.<eos> Frankly, I'm surprised that the crew of the "Raza" is willing to help broker this alliance.<eos> Given your reputation, I'd assumed you'd just assume cut our throats as save us.<eos> Guess it just goes to show how badly we wanna see this work.<eos> And if a bunch of... self-serving outlaws are willing to help your cause, maybe that could inspire you to make an effort.
I don't think the Android you know is in control anymore.<eos> We're within weapons range of the Raza.<eos> You know why I'm here.<eos> You think we're just gonna forget the fact that you betrayed us?<eos> After the coup, I could have held you prisoner, forced you to give up the drive.
I know it may seem like the easy answer right now, but sooner or later, you will regret this.<eos> - Six, it's me.<eos> - Five, where are you?<eos> I'm safe for now.<eos> I'm working on a plan to free you.
- You're threatening me?<eos> - I'll do more than threaten.<eos> Adrian, bring me the file.<eos> Come alone.<eos> If you try anything, I'll kill you all.
Go ahead.<eos> Ishida research facility, this is the Raza.<eos> Your weapons are down and you're at our mercy.<eos> Open your main shuttle bay so we can board.<eos> If you don't comply, we will destroy you.
I mean, you're the good idea lady, right?<eos> Didn't you want me to?<eos> Yes, but I did not think that you would.<eos> Well, what do you ink?<eos> Oh, I think, um... that you should do whatever makes you happy.
Unless I'm too late, in which case, you look very nice in that outfit.<eos> I didn't sleep with Brian.<eos> Okay.<eos> Wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> The truth is, um, I like Brian and I didn't want my hormones making decisions for me with him or with you the other night, which I'm really sorry about.
I just want us to go back to how we were.<eos> Is that cool with you?<eos> Yeah, that's-that's cool.<eos> We can just totally go back to the way we were.<eos> But I'd like to assure you that if you ever get crazy-pregnant-horny again,
But what I need to tell you is that I already did.<eos> So, thank you.<eos> The good news is that I did not spill anything on it.<eos> But I'm okay and that is the most important thing.<eos> I love you.
Initiate the hack.<eos> Help me.<eos> Please.<eos> Don't let me die.<eos> Who sent you?
- For the dogs.<eos> For someone who doesn't like people how come you care about dogs so much?<eos> Don't know.<eos> I like just strays and they like me.<eos> They like you 'cause you feed them.
Meet Major.<eos> Major, Gabriel.<eos> I used to have a dog.<eos> Seriously?<eos> I had you down, as more of a cat person.
I can see everything.<eos> All of your thoughts, your... decisions.<eos> - I guess privacy is just for humans.<eos> - You are human.<eos> People see you as human.
Your friend.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> Batou.<eos> Can you hear me?<eos> Who did this stunning work on you?
He's doing well you took most of the blast.<eos> I saw him down there.<eos> It was like...<eos> He waited to see me.<eos> We synaptic scanned you.
You should be able to secure them.<eos> Try and understand your importance Mira.<eos> You're what everyone will become one day.<eos> You don't know how alone that makes me feel.<eos> I can see you out there, you know.
I'm not beautiful... like you.<eos> Tell me who you are.<eos> I have been born more than once.<eos> So I have more than one name<eos> I'll find you.
I'm that which you seek to destroy.<eos> In this life, my name is...<eos> Kuze.<eos> What are you doing to me?<eos> I have, connected you, to a network of my own creation.
You kill innocent people.<eos> Innocent?<eos> Is that what you call them?<eos> I am as they made me.<eos> Who made you?
They have improved s-so much, since they made me.<eos> They thought that we would be a part of their evolution.<eos> But they have created us, to evolve alone... beyond them.<eos> Evolution?<eos> That's what you call... killing everyone who made you?
I won't let that happen.<eos> You want to kill me?<eos> Like everyone else?<eos> Do it, then.<eos> Do what you were programmed to do.
The way they died?<eos> Did that happen?<eos> No.<eos> We gave you false memories.<eos> Cutter wanted to motivate you.
Off-grid.<eos> Silent.<eos> Copy that, sir.<eos> I know where to find her.<eos> I didn't ask you to come here.
I know where to find her.<eos> I didn't ask you to come here.<eos> You never ask.<eos> But I always do.<eos> Did they send you to bring me in?
We have the Major.<eos> Why is she sedated?<eos> She's been turned by a terrorist.<eos> But you know that already.<eos> You should have called the first time she came to see you.
I'll take that under advisement.<eos> So what now?<eos> Oh, the poor pumpkin!<eos> Oh, you surprised me.<eos> She likes you.
Just happened to know I spoke English.<eos> Go figure.<eos> The bullets could've been real.<eos> Then the body armor would've been real.<eos> I don't know you, but-- I don't like to be tested.
The bullets could've been real.<eos> Then the body armor would've been real.<eos> I don't know you, but-- I don't like to be tested.<eos> Gibbons never believed you were dead!<eos> Never stopped looking for you.
Where is it?<eos> What did you do with Pandora's Box?<eos> It's in a safe place.<eos> That wasn't a part of the plan.<eos> After all these years, you're still shocked when I improvise?
Those, I'll have within 15 minutes.<eos> Kidding.<eos> But if you need a fifty of Purple Urkle, I am not the girl to ask.<eos> Okay, Cage, follow me.<eos> I'll introduce you to your ground team.
Hey, here comes the Red Bull freak show.<eos> Xander Cage, I want you to meet Paul--<eos> Donovan.<eos> Captain Paul Donovan.<eos> I know you.
Xander Cage, I want you to meet Paul--<eos> Donovan.<eos> Captain Paul Donovan.<eos> I know you.<eos> I saw you on TV!
Where you been?<eos> You stop off for the old rub-and-tug?<eos> Your mom says hi.<eos> Tracker on board?<eos> Nobody saw you?
I'm just doing the math.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> What math?<eos> Air velocity divided by distance.<eos> So, when I stuff you down the toilet, search and rescue will know where to find you between China and North Korea.
There, take cover! Okay, okay.<eos> What a rush.<eos> Damn, Becky, that's some body armor.<eos> Hey. I told you you got no manners.<eos> Did your mother ever teach you how to zip up your pants?
Andy, you need to turn yourself in.<eos> Turn myself in?<eos> Are you kidding me? With Chris dead?<eos> Now that's fucking felony-murder.<eos> Andy, I can't get you out of this.
- He's the one who ratted us out.<eos> - We don't know that for sure. Who else could it be?<eos> Oh, gee, Chris, maybe it was the cops who pulled us over for speeding half a mile from the fucking bank!<eos> - We were making a getaway. - Ugh!<eos> I'll take you. I'll just drive you.
- You have a watch?<eos> - Sure, yeah.<eos> - Know how to tell time?<eos> - It's digital.<eos> Okay, and if you get caught, you don't know anything.
So, if you don't mind taking a bit of a back seat, we'll be happy to paint you as the heroes.<eos> - May I?<eos> - Oh, by all means.<eos> Zeke, I appreciate your being frank with us, so I'm gonna go ahead and return the favor.<eos> And go ahead and stop me if I say something that rubs you the wrong way, okay?
Bradley, what's wrong?<eos> - What's happened?<eos> - I don't know. I don't know.<eos> Forget it.<eos> I love you, that's all. And, uh.
You were just so damn excited to finally get your hands on the football, you forgot we were at midfield.<eos> And then, uh. And then, that big-ass linebacker, uh.<eos> - Reggie Cutler. - Reggie Cutler.<eos> - Reggie Cutler. - Fuck, that guy was big.<eos> - He just laid you out mid-jiggle.
- I'm not Ed! I'm Doug!<eos> Schwarzenegger! Arnold's less successful. Brother.<eos> Fuck it! All right.<eos> Yeah, it's me!<eos> I'm gonna be long gone, anyway, by the time they get you out of that fucking vault. Huh? So, here.
You sound like my goddamn wife.<eos> Hey. Here.<eos> Get in the fucking vault! Get in the fucking vault, Zeke!<eos> And if I suffocate in there before morning, I guess that'll be an accident too, right?<eos> Do you want me to kill you?
I took some shots at 'em, but I just got too woozy.<eos> I had to come back in and lie down.<eos> Hi, I need an ambulance and, uh, cops. I need.<eos> I need a lot of cops.<eos> It's just something to numb the pain before we take you to the hospital.
Jo Flanagan.<eos> That's Jo with a "J" and an "O" and no<eos> I'm Renzo.<eos> With an "E" and an "O" and no<eos> You have an intense look about you, Renzo.
- He's a what?<eos> - A knobhead.<eos> Like a dickhead.<eos> I'm Donny Haczyk.<eos> Good to see you again, Donny.
What do you mean, "What do we do?"<eos> To teach that asshole a lesson.<eos> No, I don't want to do anything that will jeopardize my freedom to run my successful business.<eos> That's right. Let's just please go back to the table before they think we've left.<eos> What do you care what anyone here thinks, Bina?
Your mother wouldn't stop saying that I was not the kind of girl who ended up with you.<eos> And when it was time for you to stand up and say that she's wrong and they're all wrong and they're idiots and stand by me, then you ask me if I want to keep it.<eos> That's your first question.<eos> What was I supposed to say, El?<eos> I constantly disappoint you.
I constantly disappoint you.<eos> Then you tell me that you think our kid will grow up thinking that I'm just a joke.<eos> That I was never good enough for you.<eos> And you finally found a way to tell me.<eos> And I was so scared of losing you that when you told me you were pregnant, lasked if you wanted to keep the kid.
And you finally found a way to tell me.<eos> And I was so scared of losing you that when you told me you were pregnant, lasked if you wanted to keep the kid.<eos> I'm ridiculous in a million ways.<eos> I am. I know that.<eos> But I can't spend my whole life disappointing you" No, he doesn't get... on.
You're gonna sell our diner to Henry Grotsky.<eos> You don't out-detective me, Bina Kepp.<eos> I came to have an affair.<eos> No way.<eos> I know you.
Oh, my God!<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> That's disgusting.<eos> This wedding is over for you.<eos> I need you to give me the phone number of somebody that I can call to get you out of here right now. Oh!
Look at this.<eos> Baby cakes.<eos> Talk to the angels.<eos> It's one o'clock in the morning and you're wide awake.<eos> I love you.
Just for a minute, okay?<eos> I promise you... I'm gonna be right back to get you.<eos> I'm gonna be right back to get you.<eos> I'm right here, sweetheart.<eos> I'm not letting you go.
Shit!<eos> So even if they are not looking for you... They are looking for me.<eos> They are looking to find me. And when they do... I am gonna be right behind you.<eos> I know what's your car looks like.<eos> And I know there had to be some mom at that park... who got a picture of you.
- Where are you, honey?<eos> - Up here.<eos> Mommy, mommy.<eos> - I'm scared. - Where have you been?<eos> - Yes, I'm gonna get you down. I'm gonna get you down, honey.
Something inside him has been broken.<eos> It is simply a refusal... a denial... as if, by this vigil... he can undo what is done.<eos> You're telling me he wants his mother back, hmm?<eos> Well, that's a... that's a revelation.<eos> I'vel've been looking for you, Jakob.
Your father told me you have her gift.<eos> What would she say if she knew you might never use it again?<eos> She must have... spoken about the future before she died... about the wonderful things that lie ahead for you.<eos> Try to remember what she said.<eos> And imagine what she might say now if she could see you.
He is the future.<eos> Look at yourself... how beautiful you are.<eos> Give me your hands.<eos> They're strong. Like hers.<eos> He will not speak to please you.
We nursed her day and night... me and the boy.<eos> He saw terrible things.<eos> He heard... terrible things.<eos> When she died, I... washed her... a-and tidied her hair.<eos> The room upsets you.
You just spent a whole week crying in the same pair of sweatpants and it got dark.<eos> We're not going back there.<eos> No, I've told you a thousand times, I'll say it again, you do not need that loser.<eos> Nope. You got your real baes here. Mmm-hmm.<eos> We love you.
Patrick, will you go get me something a little bit stronger than this beer?<eos> What's the magic word?<eos> Blowjob.<eos> BRB. Thank you.<eos> Where have you been? I've been looking everywhere for you.
- You're a bitch, too. - What? You're a drunk.<eos> And you... You're just pathetic.<eos> You know what? We'd rather be bitches than a psycho.<eos> Yeah, psycho.<eos> Have you noticed that nobody likes you?
You're just pathetic.<eos> Juliet...<eos> You know what? We'd rather be bitches than a psycho.<eos> Yeah, psycho.<eos> Have you noticed that nobody likes you?
Thirty-eight.<eos> - Okay. - You can shut up now.<eos> What?<eos> Matt's at the party.<eos> Ally, you say "Matt" one more time and I will kill you in your sleep.
- Okay. - You can shut up now.<eos> What?<eos> Matt's at the party.<eos> Ally, you say "Matt" one more time and I will kill you in your sleep.<eos> I will kill you in your sleep.
What did you just say to me?<eos> Do you feel like you need to prove to us that you don't give a shit?<eos> Is that what it is?<eos> 'Cause guess what? You don't need to prove anything.<eos> We all know that you don't give a damn about anybody but yourself.
I just followed along and yet... I'm the one paying for it.<eos> Sam, what are you talking about?<eos> What?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Sam, I haven't seen you in, like, forever. Where have you...
What?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Sam, I haven't seen you in, like, forever. Where have you...<eos> Get this bitch on a leash!<eos> I love you.
I was stupid.<eos> It was very ambitious.<eos> I should go. Hey, hey, hey.<eos> Just stay for a second.<eos> I can drive you home or...
Juliet!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I know what happened back there.<eos> Get away from me.<eos> And I feel really bad about it, and I know this may sound crazy, but I have a feeling I may be able to understand you better than you think that I could.
Want something to eat?<eos> I'm good, thanks.<eos> Lindsay's got it covered.<eos> Mom?<eos> I love you.
Okay.<eos> No, I love you, Ally, because you're curious about the world.<eos> And you're passionate, and you are driven.<eos> Did someone swallow Oprah this morning?<eos> I love you, Linds.
No, I love you, Ally, because you're curious about the world.<eos> And you're passionate, and you are driven.<eos> Did someone swallow Oprah this morning?<eos> I love you, Linds.<eos> I love you because you're the kind of friend that toilet-papers Jason Foster's house for a week straight all by herself just because he said that I was a bad kisser.
Just don't.<eos> But it's Juliet.<eos> Exactly, it's Juliet.<eos> She has a name and she is a person.<eos> Yesterday, you said you were afraid she would bite you if she got too close.
Better get started then.<eos> I don't have much time.<eos> What was that for?<eos> Because I wanted to.<eos> I love you.
You're a bitch.<eos> I have been a bitch.<eos> I have been a bitch. We all have been bitches, and I...<eos> I'm sorry. I have to go.<eos> Listen to me. I'm trying to tell you how sorry...
- Isn't that so, Herr Heck?<eos> Not now, please, Stefan.<eos> Well, Hitler wants Poland.<eos> It's what everyone's saying.<eos> I wouldn't know anything about it, I assure you.
They dragged Maurycy away like he was a criminal.<eos> That brilliant, kind man, like he was nothing.<eos> We're going to go where they want us to go, that's all.<eos> And when the war is over, we'll come home again.<eos> I've known you since we were boys, Jan.
I'll work with him.<eos> We can keep our eye on him with the bison here.<eos> Well, he trusts you, that's clear.<eos> You have a way with him.<eos> I don't know how I can ask you to do this.
- Mmm-hmm.<eos> - She'll be in estrus a short time.<eos> - Yes, a day at most.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> Well, I'm afraid I've worn you out with all our talk.
Yes.<eos> The female's strong.<eos> She'll give birth in spring.<eos> Did he...<eos> Did he bathe you, Punia?
What will the pig farmer do now, I wonder.<eos> Who knows, Herr Heck?<eos> A man might be surprised.<eos> He comes here whenever he likes.<eos> He touches you however he likes.
We'll move Mrs. Mayzel to Bramki.<eos> They're taking Mrs. Poznanska to Foksal Street.<eos> - Jan...<eos> How did you get here?<eos> I followed you.
The war's turning.<eos> I've been ordered back to Berlin.<eos> What bad luck for us.<eos> We'll be sorry to see you go.<eos> I'm here to ask you, my friend,
Give a little kiss? Huh?<eos> I'm just asking.<eos> Excuseme.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry, Todd.<eos> Did my, uh, girlfriend replacement just trip you?
MaybeHannah'shiding somethinginhermouth.<eos> Whoa! Nope.<eos> Nothingin there.<eos> Oh, my... What's going on with you?<eos> Man, he loves you.
You're trying to help me?<eos> You want to help me?<eos> You're my wife, Elizabeth.<eos> -You should support me.<eos> -I do support you.
-It's the only way, okay?<eos> - How many people are in the house? - Okay.<eos> Check the back of the house.<eos> Somebody give me a hand!<eos> - Go, go, go. - We got you.
Check the back of the house.<eos> Somebody give me a hand!<eos> - Go, go, go. - We got you.<eos> Okay, we got you. Got her.<eos> -We got you. We got you. -Okay.
Here, here, let...<eos> -I-i got it.<eos> -Fran, Fran, Fran, Fran.<eos> Stop it. Stop.<eos> Good to see you, Ethan.
Hold it! Hold it!<eos> Stop!<eos> Halt!<eos> - Hey! - Hey, hey, there she is.<eos> -Hey, hey. -We've got you. We've got you.
As long as something loves you, right?<eos> CanI havesomemore?<eos> Oh, you're so sweet.<eos> You're so cute.<eos> Hi. I love you.
That's just...<eos> How do you know he's not some crazy dog fucker?<eos> He's not.<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> Where you headed, bro?
Well, I just... I don't have any family left.<eos> And I've known you... since we were, what, nine years old? Ten?<eos> I don't have a single person who shares my same memories, you know?<eos> Lucky you.<eos> You know... people always said that you were kind of "difficult," but I don't know, I guess that...
Why the hell do people move to the suburbs?<eos> It's like a living death.<eos> Wilson, what are we doing?<eos> What?<eos> I never... stopped loving you, Pippi.
No! I'm not letting go!<eos> Let it go!<eos> Wilson!<eos> I'm gonna kick his ass!<eos> Believe me, Pippi gave you a true gift... by giving you away, because we were in no position to be parents.
Oh, you were told the truth.<eos> She was on the street, strung out on drugs... comforting strangers.<eos> I never was on the street.<eos> Look, it doesn't... Don't get bogged down in the details right now.<eos> We're just thrilled to finally have the opportunity to get to meet you!
She was on the street, strung out on drugs... comforting strangers.<eos> I never was on the street.<eos> Look, it doesn't... Don't get bogged down in the details right now.<eos> We're just thrilled to finally have the opportunity to get to meet you!<eos> And if you're wondering about the lack of family resemblance... you couldn't tell it by looking at her, but she used to be a real hippo.
And I'll let her go.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I think you're right, Pippi.<eos> She certainly doesn't need any help from us.<eos> It's like she has that miserable, anguished look... like you had when I first met you.
Hey, come on, hop in.<eos> I'll give you a ride.<eos> No, thanks.<eos> I'll get the bus.<eos> No, no, I'll give you a ride.
Pippi?<eos> Goddamn it!<eos> Calm yourself.<eos> Fuck!<eos> This is why I left you in the first place.
Bye! Bye!<eos> You know, I heard you call him "Dad"<eos> and I wonder if he realizes how lucky he really is.<eos> I better go.<eos> Okay, well, hey, let me give you a hug.
"Was?"<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> She got so sick, Wilson.<eos> And in the end she could barely even... She could barely even lift her little head.<eos> I tried to find you.
Urinated.<eos> Urinated... on my address book and chewed up two sofas...<eos> Three.<eos> Three, but... in doing so, you taught us the utter worthlessness of those things.<eos> We celebrate you, Pepper.
I just... A baby?<eos> A baby.<eos> So that makes me a grandfather?<eos> Oh, my God. Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, my God. I just came here... to shit on you for ratting me out to the Feds, and now this?
What are you talking about?<eos> I can't move to Portland.<eos> Oh, no, I know.<eos> I wasn't, you know, suggesting...<eos> I know this is a really emotional issue for you... but you have to accept that she's not your daughter.
I can't move to Portland.<eos> Oh, no, I know.<eos> I wasn't, you know, suggesting...<eos> I know this is a really emotional issue for you... but you have to accept that she's not your daughter.<eos> You barely know her and... she sent you to jail, for Chrissake!
You are such a beautiful girl.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I got to go.<eos> Wilson, she has to... Wilson!<eos> I really love you.
I'll come straight back!<eos> Don't you see, I'm cursed to this ship?<eos> That's why I'm here.<eos> I think I know a way to break your curse.<eos> To free you from the Dutchman. - Henry, no.☻
I'm sorry.<eos> My curse will never be broken.<eos> This is my fate.<eos> You must let me go.<eos> I love you son.
You don't wanna get kicked off another ship.<eos> It's a Dutch bark.<eos> Probably stolen by the Pirate Bonnet.<eos> My God.<eos> I warned you of leaving your post, boy.
This is treason.<eos> - Lock him up. - No.<eos> - We're going in!<eos> This was your last chance, Turner.<eos> If it were up to me, I'd string you from the yardarm. On deck!
Did we not find the treasure of Macedonia together?<eos> It was a trawl of rotten wood.<eos> - Gold of King Midas.<eos> - Pile of donkey dung.<eos> Face it Jack, bad luck dogs you, day and night.
The price of crossing my door is blood, Captain.<eos> That explains why you're not so busy.<eos> Everyone pays, eventually.<eos> Shansa, you and I made a bond long ago.<eos> I saved you from the gallows, remember?
Yes you have, many times.<eos> Skeleton goes into a bar, orders a beer and a mop.<eos> Funny as ever.<eos> Come on, let's go!<eos> If they disembowel you, ask for Victor.
No, no, no, no!<eos> Horses?<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - You're welcome Milady.<eos> Got you!
No, no!<eos> There's no treasure.<eos> There's no treasure that can save him.<eos> He will die, as will you.<eos> I be the only one that can lead you to him.
- There is no map in this map.<eos> - Give me my diary.<eos> Give me the map no man can read.<eos> If you could read it, then it wouldn't be called 'the map no man can read'.<eos> I beg you please, don't argue with her.
I knew it, absolutely smitten with'er.<eos> Now, a bit of discretion when courting a brunette. Never pursue her sister.<eos> But, if you cannot avoid the charming sister, kill the brother, savvy?<eos> No, I do not savvy.<eos> Who hurt you?
Help!<eos> - Carina!<eos> - Henry, help me.<eos> - Help her!<eos> By rule of the King, I sentence you all to death.
Welcome back, Captain.<eos> I thank you very much.<eos> Coming through.<eos> - Captain!<eos> - Thank you, I remember you.
- Ruth. Ruth, enough.<eos> - Look I just wanna know if...<eos> I'm sorry if I have questions, Bernie. I'm sorry if I'm a little scared, okay?<eos> It's just you always keep me in the dark.<eos> I keep you in the dark to protect you.
All right, we've all heard this one, Casanova.<eos> - Come on. - In my opinion?<eos> Be honest.<eos> - Peter's way more attractive.<eos> - Oh. So you've got a thing for barrel-chested bald men with big stomachs?
You don't understand. Leave it alone.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - Good night.<eos> - I love you, Dad.
"Bernie will take care of everything."<eos> He's gone and I don't know what to do.<eos> Bernie: It's gonna be okay.<eos> You can take all of Erwin's other accounts... his savings, life insurance, everything... and you can put it all in his account here.<eos> God bless you, Bernie.
We're treading water like a fucking paraplegic here. - Man: I was just saying...<eos> - Hold on, let me get rid of this idiot.<eos> The joke on the street is that Bernie's like the Jewish T-bill. - Very funny. I'm on the phone.<eos> I'm on the phone. - He's that safe. I'm on the phone.<eos> I'll introduce you guys later. He's gonna love you.
Listen, I'll think about it.<eos> - Okay. - Okay? But don't take too long.<eos> In all seriousness, don't take too long.<eos> - Carl... - I said it. I will think about it.<eos> - Period. - I live you, I respect that.
- Maybe you should take a couple days off.<eos> - No, I can't. I have to be at the office first thing in the morning.<eos> - Founder of Home Depot.<eos> - Reschedule.<eos> If you ever trusted me to help you with the advisory, you know, I could handle this kind of thing for you.
- I know, I know. It's just hard because I know he's gonna be disappointed.<eos> Well, I'm not.<eos> I am very proud of you. Thanks.<eos> Andy's voice:<eos> Okay, I'll see you when I get home.
Turn around.<eos> Open your legs.<eos> Bernie's voice: In the cell next to me, they got this terrorist. Some sheikh.<eos> I can't remember his name. But that's my neighbor.<eos> Go figure. Ruth's voice: I don't understand why they put you in maximum security.
- It's insane.<eos> - I know, I'm sorry. I just... I hate that every time<eos> I start to feel normal again, something bad happens. Have you checked your text messages?<eos> Oh, my God, he's so cute.<eos> I love you.
Mark.<eos> - It's... it's stunning.<eos> - Just like you.<eos> Only the best for my girl.<eos> - I love you.
- It's... it's stunning.<eos> - Just like you.<eos> Only the best for my girl.<eos> - I love you.<eos> - Love you.
Nothing is gonna happen to you.<eos> Okay?<eos> - Is this your first time?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - What made you come?
- Excuse me?<eos> - The Russian baths out in Brighton Beach.<eos> - Platza.<eos> - I'm still not following you.<eos> They lay you down in a sauna and then a big fat hairy Russian guy comes in with an oil-dipped oak-leaf brush and just beats the stress right out of your back and shoulders.
- I'm still not following you.<eos> They lay you down in a sauna and then a big fat hairy Russian guy comes in with an oil-dipped oak-leaf brush and just beats the stress right out of your back and shoulders.<eos> Wow, people pay for this?<eos> They say it keeps you young.<eos> I'm going this Saturday if you're curious.
Well, when people see a blind person start to get up their instinct is to help him.<eos> But with Bill, if he ever needs any help, he'll let you know. He can still see shapes and light, but don't use any hand signals or gestures.<eos> He won't be able to make them out.<eos> And then one last thing for the visually impaired, feeling is seeing.<eos> - So don't be alarmed if he touches you.
- Yes?<eos> Good news for you today.<eos> We finally have a female reader for you.<eos> - What does she look like?<eos> - What do you care?
- I know your type.<eos> - And what type is that?<eos> - The type who loves her enormous penthouse and her ridiculously oversized diamond ring enough to cast a blind eye to all the heartless acts her husband had to commit in order to get her these things.<eos> I don't have to tolerate this.<eos> You know, it's actually my civic duty perhaps to punish you just a little.
Now.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Can we just start reading?<eos> You know, it's rude to leave the room without telling me.<eos> I was sitting here talking to you and now I don't know what you heard and what you missed.
You try it.<eos> - If it were me. - Yeah?<eos> I'd make the most of it.<eos> Have a little fun.<eos> Why not? Try something outrageous that you can only get away with if you're stuck in a room with a blind man.
So work up an appetite.<eos> Hey, it's me calling.<eos> Have I told you lately how brilliant and bold and how beautiful, and brave, and all the other b-words that mean perfect man, that you are?<eos> In case you don't know who's calling, this is your wife.<eos> Anyway, I love you.
How was your day off?<eos> It was fine.<eos> That's good.<eos> You still don't like me, do you?<eos> Am I supposed to like you?
- Not good enough.<eos> Mark... I need you to take an honest look at what you're facing.<eos> There's a possibility of you doing substantial time.<eos> Your associate is testifying against you.<eos> Arnold, let me ask you something.
Gavin!<eos> I didn't expect you to work for the privilege of my company.<eos> I don't want to take your money, Bill.<eos> I'm not offering you money, you presumptive little shit.<eos> I'm inviting you to sit in on my class.
- Yes, I'm sorry.<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> Yes.<eos> Great.<eos> May I ask you to do something for me?
From now on, you don't eat.<eos> You bring your food, you put it on a tray and you bring it to me.<eos> Big Ricky G. Entiendes?<eos> You understand?<eos> Didn't your mother teach you not to touch another man's brownie?
No, I was actually asking myself why I said yes.<eos> Well, I am guilty of a crime that I would never forgive someone else for committing.<eos> I judged a book by its cover and I misjudged you.<eos> And in spite of your ridiculously oversized diamond ring I was wrong about you.<eos> You're not at all what I thought you were.
I can't.<eos> Please don't leave me.<eos> Please don't leave me. Not when my whole fucking world is falling apart. Baby, please.<eos> Please, baby.<eos> I need you so much. And I need you. I need you.
Please don't leave me.<eos> Please don't leave me. Not when my whole fucking world is falling apart. Baby, please.<eos> Please, baby.<eos> I need you so much. And I need you. I need you.<eos> I need you.
Hey, you're looking to get yourself killed?<eos> - You got him, you got him?<eos> - Yeah, I got him.<eos> Breathe, okay.<eos> - Frank? Is that you, Frank? - Yes, it's me.
- Buddy, you okay?<eos> Hey. It's me calling.<eos> I just wanted to tell you to be nice tonight.<eos> You've been a grouch for the last three nights and I'm feeling kinda fragile, so please just be nice tonight, okay?<eos> I love you.
"Don't worry," said papa.<eos> The next morning... However the Nemesis of love is fear.<eos> Fear creeps into you.<eos> Builds up walls.<eos> Traps you inside yourself.
Traps you inside yourself.<eos> Fear strangles you, slowly subtly until one day there's nothing left to win or lose.<eos> Nothing left but the thirst for the one drink you don't have.<eos> Nothing left, but the memory of the one pair of lips that could have saved your soul.<eos> If only fear hadn't kept you from taking the leap.
The born king.<eos> Yeah, and when he does, he'll spank your arse.<eos> Now, let's get your hands clean while you still got some.<eos> He'll cut 'em off and have you in chains.<eos> If we can catch you, they can catch you.
Someone here to see you. Mmm-hmm.<eos> I think you need to see her.<eos> Do you know who I am?<eos> I know who you are, Mage.<eos> I've seen you in my dreams.
They may have come for you, but they will leave and will leave with a lasting impression of me.<eos> They may even hate me.<eos> I'll let them hate just so long as they fear.<eos> When people fear you, I mean, really fear you, it is the most intoxicating sensation a man can possess.<eos> A force of something almost indescribable moves through your blood and takes you over completely.
But you're not gonna let me do that, are you?<eos> And why aren't we?<eos> You just lost two men.<eos> But you were prepared to lose five to save this pretty neck.<eos> - Do I know you?
Stop!<eos> Fuck me.<eos> Let's go!<eos> - I'm holding you up. Go on without me.<eos> - No, Lack, come on. Let's go. - No, I'll see you at the safe house.
Catching me breath.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Nothing. I'm all right. Just got to get to the safe house.<eos> Can you make it?<eos> I love you, mate.
Is that you, Blue?<eos> Yes, boss!<eos> Did you find your father?<eos> He's found him!<eos> We need to get you out of here.
He leaves us alone this way. Because he wants to be free.<eos> All his life, he's tried to get free.<eos> He doesn't know how.<eos> You aren't who you think you are.<eos> He doesn't love you.
All his life, he's tried to get free.<eos> He doesn't know how.<eos> You aren't who you think you are.<eos> He doesn't love you.<eos> I like you this way.
I went along like someone in a dream.<eos> I knew I had to tell you.<eos> Come clean.<eos> I didn't know how.<eos> I love you, I love you, I love you...
Do you love me?<eos> Why do you ask that?<eos> I like to hear it.<eos> You don't like to say it.<eos> I love you.
This year, to help us usher in and host a great social season, I would especially like to thank Layne Cricket and his wife Susan for serving.-...<eos> You get used to drifting.<eos> Waiting.<eos> They say follow the light.<eos> So happy to meet you.
- I don't understand either.<eos> - Except for you.<eos> - It's different.<eos> - Sweet of you to say.<eos> I hear you have songs on the radio and you're meant for better things.
- It's different.<eos> - Sweet of you to say.<eos> I hear you have songs on the radio and you're meant for better things.<eos> It'd be awful to have these good times and not have life itself.<eos> I wanna meet you before you move on - and leave us behind. - Mm-hmm.
What is that?<eos> It's a chicken.<eos> Hold on, you gotta...<eos> You're beautiful.<eos> I hope I don't fall in love with you.
It's a chicken.<eos> Hold on, you gotta...<eos> You're beautiful.<eos> I hope I don't fall in love with you.<eos> Nobody asked you to.
Answer me that.<eos> I feel like we are so... connected.<eos> And it's...<eos> I can't really understand, it's like...<eos> I forget everything, but seeing you again...
It's kind of...<eos> I'm weird.<eos> - I'm just...<eos> - What's your fantasy?<eos> What turns you on?
I'm really scared of spiders.<eos> Um, but most things don't scare me.<eos> I think I have a thick skin.<eos> I think I'm pretty strong.<eos> No, but what really scares you?
No.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Did we meet before?<eos> - Did we?<eos> - I've seen you before.
What bad thing did you do?<eos> Just... got involved with... this man who I thought could help me and...<eos> You made a mistake, you know? Do you look at it...<eos> You'll do fine.<eos> I love you.
Think I gotta go home.<eos> Dad's sick.<eos> Mom's gone crazy.<eos> Brother's up to no good.<eos> I won't stop loving you.
My face is beautiful.<eos> Why would I change that?<eos> What the fuck you mean?<eos> Your mask came off.<eos> They saw you, nigga.
Okay.<eos> Say it out loud, or I'm gonna keep this.<eos> I thought I was walking into a controlled situation.<eos> Instead, I found myself in the middle of a meth lab with a pissed off junkie.<eos> He assaulted you?
If Frank gets involved here...<eos> I got your drugs.<eos> I got the rest stashed.<eos> I'll get it to you when I get my son.<eos> I don't get you, Downs.
Now, Stanley, you never do.<eos> Looking for Mr. Rubino.<eos> I think that's them.<eos> We gotta go.<eos> I'll get you out of here.
Listen, I'm telling you, T, I'm undercover.<eos> I've been working this case for two years, and I'm almost...<eos> I almost got it done.<eos> That's why I haven't been around.<eos> That's why I haven't been able to take you to your games or whatever that is.
Why don't you call for fucking backup?<eos> Because I can't trust anybody!<eos> Where are them drugs?<eos> Fuck you!<eos> I'm gonna kill you, Bryant!
I'm fucked anyway.<eos> We been friends 20 years.<eos> You gonna fuckin' rat on me?<eos> What do you mean, rat on you?<eos> I got all the information on you and could've took you down.
I'm comin' out.<eos> Don't have anything on me. But I know where the drugs are.<eos> Okay?<eos> It's been a fucked-up day, I know it.<eos> I can take you there.
Some storm?<eos> Pretty bad.<eos> Took out power and telephone lines.<eos> Power only just came back.<eos> Listen... I... I don't wanna drop you on the road with this weather coming out there.
They liked me a lot, so you know, the word got around and suddenly, well, this American literary agent flew out to meet me in Madrid, and he said that the studios were interested to adapt, some of my books to the screen.<eos> And so, for all my sins I signed with him.<eos> So he sold the book, and they got me to write the screenplay and suddenly out of the blue you know, they forgot the agreement, entirely.<eos> And they gave it to somebody else to write.<eos> So they kicked you out of your own movie?
You know, you're a real disappointment, Paul.<eos> Any excuse, not to work?<eos> I invite you to my home, and I'm a prisoner in my own house?<eos> Look at what you made me do, Paul.<eos> Don't make me hurt you. Do not!
Don't make me hurt you.<eos> Don't make me hurt you.<eos> You know, I don't know what you're talking about with that woman screaming.<eos> And, yeah, you bet strangers make me nervous as you would be, if you'd just got out of prison.<eos> They're looking for you, aren't they?
You're completely out of your mind. You know that, right?<eos> You just killed the fucking sheriff, and you're talking about the agreement?<eos> You have been here three days.<eos> First you put a knife to my throat, then a gun to my head.<eos> And maybe I am crazy, too, because why I didn't toss you out day one, is baffling to me.
I didn't kill anybody.<eos> You did! You did!<eos> This is fucking insane!<eos> Why are you still sitting here?<eos> They're gonna storm this place, and you are definitely going back to prison.
Give Renee's family some closure.<eos> They deserve it, don't you think?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about whoever you are.<eos> Okay.<eos> We're gonna convict you of every murder you've ever done.
We got him on tape, and I don't know how you get into this storytelling thing but he's gonna say that's what he was doing there and that creates plausible deniability.<eos> - His word against mine?<eos> - Well, you don't have to convince me, Jack.<eos> Look, you've worked too hard on this one for it to not go our way. I don't think I have to tell you, without a confession, we're fucked.<eos> The boss is gonna book him. They want you inside.
I deserve to live with this pain.<eos> You had your chance with me.<eos> - No, listen to me!<eos> You owe this to me.<eos> It was up to me to pick you up on the road.
- Yeah, I know.<eos> - Then why are you narrating in that voice?<eos> - Hmm.<eos> Because it's fun. - "Fun".<eos> So, uhh, why do they call you "Happy"?
The Stark internship?<eos> I have to tell you...<eos> Not a fan of that Tony Stark.<eos> Distracted all the time...<eos> It's got you in your head.
But I'm ready for more than that now.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> That is not what you thought when I took on Captain America.<eos> Trust me, kid.<eos> If Cap wanted to lay you out, he would have.
- We gotta get out of here.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> We got to follow them.<eos> Maybe they can lead me to the guy that dropped me in a lake.<eos> - Someone dropped you in a lake?
Seriously?<eos> The door will most likely remain closed until morning.<eos> Morning?<eos> Hey, suit lady.<eos> I kinda feel bad calling you "Suit Lady", you know?
This is your last chance.<eos> I'm gonna die.<eos> I did it!<eos> Hey, how you doing?<eos> Don't worry about it, I got you.
You're okay.<eos> - Okay. - Good.<eos> Come on up, come on.<eos> - Guys, stand back.<eos> - I got you.
But take it from a guy who's been frozen for 65 years.<eos> The only way to really be cool, is to follow the rules.<eos> We all know what's right.<eos> We all know what's wrong.<eos> Next time those turkeys try to convince you that something you know...
- Alright, chill...<eos> - Come on!<eos> - What happened to your voice?<eos> - What do you mean, what happened to my voice?<eos> I heard you by the bridge.
Last week, decathlon was the most important thing, but...<eos> I almost died.<eos> No. I ju-- - I just mean that...<eos> It was not cool, especially be...<eos> Because I like you.
No.<eos> And, uhh...<eos> When I dance with her, I'll put my hands on her hips.<eos> Your daffodils.<eos> - Love you.
Solid dude.<eos> - Look!<eos> So cute.<eos> - Aww.<eos> I've seen you around, right?
- Thanks, Dad.<eos> You head in there, Gumdrop.<eos> I'm gonna give Peter the, "Dad talk".<eos> Don't let him intimidate you.<eos> - Love you.
You walk through those doors, you forget any of this happened.<eos> And don't you ever, ever...<eos> Interfere with my business again.<eos> Because if you do...<eos> I'll kill you...
Interfere with my business again.<eos> Because if you do...<eos> I'll kill you...<eos> And everybody you love.<eos> I'll kill you dead.
That makes no sense.<eos> - I thought he said he was going out of town.<eos> - Weird.<eos> Oh, I reached Mr. Happy.<eos> Don't think he likes you, by the way.
- Surprised?<eos> - Oh, hey, Pete.<eos> - I didn't hear you come in.<eos> - It's over.<eos> I've got you.
Bingo.<eos> Your wings...<eos> Your wings are gonna explode!<eos> - Time to go home, Pete!<eos> - I'm trying to save you!
I don't know what I would do without this job.<eos> I mean, before I met Tony...<eos> So, how long have you been here?<eos> Long enough to be awkward.<eos> Boss wants to see you.
Boundaries are good.<eos> Sorry I took your suit.<eos> I mean, you had it coming.<eos> Actually, it turns out, it was the perfect, sort of tough love moment that you needed, right?<eos> To urge you on, right?
Last chance: Yes or No?<eos> - No.<eos> - Okay.<eos> It's kind of a Springsteeny, working class hero, vibe of the day.<eos> Happy will take you home.
- Yes.<eos> Look at this!<eos> Now get your ass up here.<eos> I can't make any promises.<eos> I love you.
It's a good thing you're driving... and not the old man.<eos> Hey, little less to the old man, sweet tits.<eos> Hey, language, language.<eos> - Be respectful there, sugerdad.<eos> - I can hear you.
This is expedition party reporting.<eos> Do you read me?<eos> Tennessee?<eos> Tennessee, Ricks, come in.<eos> I am not sure they'll hear you, through the storm.
Do you read me?<eos> Are you reading, landing team?<eos> Yes, we read you.<eos> Can you hear me?<eos> We hear you.
Are you reading, landing team?<eos> Yes, we read you.<eos> Can you hear me?<eos> We hear you.<eos> We hear you.
Where is Oram?<eos> Dead.<eos> They're all dead!<eos> Tennessee, do you read?<eos> Yes I can hear you.
Understood.<eos> Let's kill this fucker.<eos> Move...<eos> Fuck!<eos> I got you, you son of a bitch!
Are you serious?<eos> What's up?<eos> You are supposed to be selling clothes to the customers. Not to yourself.<eos> And what are you even doing on the floor?<eos> I'm re-racking clothes you know what?
They're in a seated position.<eos> She's already up. I'll put the butter on myself. Thank you, mama.<eos> Wow, you're gonna butter it yourself?<eos> Yeah, I'm gonna butter it myself.<eos> Does mom feed you like a baby bird when I'm not here?
No, I'm not, mom. I'm chewing like a person.<eos> Then she opened her mouth and showed it to me.<eos> He's lying again. Hey, guys!<eos> This is supposed to be fun.<eos> I know what's going on with you, man.
No, your tit is actually emerged.<eos> I thought I felt a breeze.<eos> Will you excuse me?<eos> Oh, no. Yeah, absolutely.<eos> God, I wish I could invite you up. But I can't.
Mom! Come on!<eos> I'm trying!<eos> Come on!<eos> I'm coming.<eos> Watch out, mom! He's right behind you!
And then when I go to sleep at night, I'm going to have an image of that spear going into that man's throat. Ugh!<eos> Why would you bring that up, mom?<eos> Can't you just comfort me?<eos> Can you just please be my parent and make me feel better?<eos> Do you want me to make you feel better?
like you've been on my Facebook page or something.<eos> Let me tell you something.<eos> You called an officer of the us government and threatened his wife over the phone.<eos> I'm gonna tell you what's gonna happen right now so I want you to get real quiet, okay?<eos> If you call this number one more motherfucking time I'm gonna show up at your house, handcuff you to the bumper of your car and drag you to federal prison, where you will be skull raped to within an inch of your life, every single fucking night!
Everything will be fine.<eos> Everything is not fine, Emily Louise.<eos> Look where we are. Look where we are.<eos> In the middle of the Amazon!<eos> Oh, my god! That's how desperate I am to spend time with you.
And, remember, when you get down there, get to the embassy.<eos> No, mom! I want to stay with you!<eos> Mom!<eos> Mom! Everything's gonna be okay.<eos> I love you!
Hi.<eos> Hi.<eos> We were able to get your items sent over from the hotel. Any updates on my mom?<eos> Oh, I'm sorry. There's nothing yet.<eos> But we are gonna get you an escort to the airfield base... And then someone will get you home from there.
Come on, man. Be that guy.<eos> Who's the guy?<eos> Not me!<eos> It isn't. It's never been.<eos> I'd love to be the guy who sweeps you off your feet and is your hero and can save your mother and take care of you and maybe we hook up. I don't know.
Fuck, fuck, fuck<eos> oh, honey!<eos> I made a shiv.<eos> You're alive.<eos> Oh, my god, mom. I'm so sorry I got you into all of this.
oh, honey!<eos> I made a shiv.<eos> You're alive.<eos> Oh, my god, mom. I'm so sorry I got you into all of this.<eos> I should have just listened to you. I should have listened to you.
You always answer.<eos> I know, I know.<eos> You're that person for me, mom.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I love you.
What is that?<eos> It's a stuffed pancake.<eos> Awesome!<eos> I'm gonna go make a request because I want to dance.<eos> Oh, I love you. I love you.
No, that fork-tongued speaker of calumny shall rassle you down...<eos> Check it out. You think that's the asshole who woke me up?<eos> Everything that you thought was rued shall recede!<eos> We shall be rassled down!<eos> The walls that keep you, the woman beside you...
- Who is this?<eos> What the fuck?<eos> - What a thing to say.<eos> Here I am, trying to be neighborly.<eos> I may be the only one who understands you
Just ignore whatever's going on out there.<eos> Look, stay here with me.<eos> Ok, you need this.<eos> This is your home.<eos> I love you.
What are you doing?<eos> I was thirsty.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Getting something to eat.<eos> - Can I ask you a question?
When did we meet?<eos> That is such a silly question.<eos> We met yesterday.<eos> I'm your wife?<eos> I love you.
Scarlett.<eos> You know me.<eos> You know all about me.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I saw you at the supermarket.
No.<eos> You know, if you really were him...<eos> If you really were Wayne,<eos> I'd watch you drown 1,000 times.<eos> Every night I would beat you and cut you and drag you into another hole.
Every night I would beat you and cut you and drag you into another hole.<eos> And I'd watch you, and your eyes, your wild eyes, as earth spills in on you.<eos> And you'd finally understand that this is it. This is it!<eos> And I'm the one who's kneeling in front of you, filling your grave with laughter. - And I would say it again and again and again.<eos> A man in a hood came and broke in and he threw you into a hole,
"Flesh, blood, bone..."<eos> Are all just temporal.<eos> "Rock lasts forever."<eos> "Which is where my spirit will reside."<eos> "I love you.
What?<eos> GOD OF DEATH...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> What?<eos> POWERFUL SETH I WELCOME YOU INTO THIS MORTAL BODY...
Just give in.<eos> Nick.<eos> Nick, wake up.<eos> Wake up.<eos> They will kill you just as they killed my chosen before you.
No! Oh no!<eos> Nick?<eos> Nick?<eos> Nick?<eos> You shouldn't be here.
I don't know what I am.<eos> I don't want to hurt you, Jenny.<eos> You are alive.<eos> You are alive.<eos> I'm so glad you're alive.
The only reason I came to this dung heap of a casino is to find a relic to keep that monster locked away forever.<eos> Boys, boys! You're boring me.<eos> Let's play, shall we?<eos> My luck's running as hot as me naughty bits.<eos> But our next group of friends is due to arrive, so it's time to bust you out.
If you ever need a refresher...<eos> We've had this conversation.<eos> I haven't changed my mind.<eos> Sure, sit out the war between good and evil.<eos> After all, you've got a good thing going being applauded by mindless twits.
Destiny forged the Dreamstone with black magic and his soul.<eos> He used it to subject people to their most terrifying nightmares and then feed off their torment.<eos> It was actually the demon Etrigan who won the day.<eos> To battle, Etrigan.<eos> Should you succeed, I will release you of your bond to me.
As a fellow showman, this is no way to treat your guests.<eos> Now, settle down!<eos> Stop hitting yourself. Stop hitting yourself. Stop hitting yourself.<eos> Not everything can be solved with your peashooter.<eos> Just because you're dead doesn't mean you're beyond my retribution.
It's the TV dinner of spell casting, dear.<eos> Here's what real magic looks like.<eos> Z!<eos> Z, are you daft?<eos> I will kill you, woman!
So we had to frame Faust and get you to bring me here.<eos> Now I'm immortal and supercharged!<eos> You've been played for a sap.<eos> The Stone isn't sentient.<eos> What's left of Destiny's soul was whispering sweet nothings in your ear, getting you to commit atrocities to gain power and make his move.
Perfect.<eos> Glad to see you back on your feet, Zatanna.<eos> Whatever you're gonna do, do it fast.<eos> The so-called Guardian of the Green who secretly hopes to be human again.<eos> Let me dispel you of that notion.
So, do not steal, this is wrong.<eos> If you stole, do not steal from the Valley Town.<eos> Yes, I have two great friends.<eos> You made me a partner in the crime of theft.<eos> We did not ask you to do anything.
I do not think you hear me!<eos> I hear you very well.<eos> Do you know my opinion?<eos> I think we owe ourselves To live every day we have.<eos> I feel I really want Get to know you more.
Now bring me some food, Because I am starving.<eos> Well, that's better.<eos> I did not think you would join us today.<eos> I am old to carry a grudge.<eos> This has never stopped you from doing so.
O hell!<eos> - On your messenger!<eos> - Pay attention to your words.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Your father will take you out of school today.
Yes, this week.<eos> He is not good at ending things.<eos> I give him a chance, my dear, for my sake.<eos> Surely "Joe", But only because you are my best friend.<eos> I love you, my little girl.
I do not move?<eos> I'm not telling me not to move, You do not move!<eos> I will not be a victim anymore.<eos> Ask them not to move too.<eos> They can hear you well.
What?<eos> Hey, why not wine?<eos> You can call an ambulance please?<eos> I beg you?<eos> What hurts you, "Willie"?
"I have nothing to lose."<eos> "What's the worst that might happen?"<eos> "I can spend the rest of my life."<eos> "In a prison like a country club Without paying rent."<eos> Have you gone to school to do this work?
It's your problem now.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Good luck, may you enjoy Every moment of your time together.<eos> We love you.<eos> We love you also, young man.
Uh, eagle four, this is eagle six.<eos> Whatever the delay, pick up the fuckin' pace.<eos> Over.<eos> Eagle six, this is eagle four.<eos> Why do you hate me when I love you so much?
Okay. Right. We...<eos> We will not leave. We will not leave until the problem is solved.<eos> He say those people you say are bad will not hurt us unless we help the Americans.<eos> He wants us to leave.<eos> Listen here, you piece of shit. I hope you get shot and fuckin' die.
- Yeah, Roger that.<eos> Good.<eos> Full brief in about an hour.<eos> I know.<eos> I've... I heard you, Anne.
Medevac is two Mikes out.<eos> Get a stretcher over here!<eos> Cowboy comin' in hot!<eos> - Come on. Let's go. Get him up.<eos> - We got you. We got you.
Ella, I'm begging you, stay here. Don't get into that car, please.<eos> What's wrong with you, Ella?<eos> I want to call the police.<eos> I want to call the police.<eos> The people who want you dead own half the police in Europe.
No, I...<eos> I can't. I... I'm claustrophobic.<eos> We have to cross the border. They're going to be looking for a young girl and a man. I can't.<eos> I'll freak out.<eos> There are people out there that are still hunting you. They're going to kill you.
I finish what I start.<eos> And when we find the girl, we find Lucas.<eos> We've got other problems besides the girl, Richard.<eos> Like what?<eos> Her father wasn't just planning to sell you out to the feds. He diverted funds from your US accounts.
Okay? It's not...<eos> I'm not gonna do anything to you.<eos> All right?<eos> Just...<eos> Look, I was hired to kill you, but I'm not going to do it 'cause...
It's a great plan. You're gonna fucking die.<eos> I thought you are helping me, that that's what we came here to do.<eos> I thought you were helping me.<eos> Give me a minute.<eos> No, you were right. It's better your daughter never meets you.
You're very lucky, Miss Hatto.<eos> Mr. Addison isn't going to press charges.<eos> You mean I'm free to go?<eos> An agent from the FBI will be taking custody of you.<eos> Ella, hello. I'm here to take you home.
Everyone says that.<eos> Gonna be sticking around for a while?<eos> No, I'm supposed to go back in a couple of days.<eos> Can you not stay a bit longer?<eos> It'd be nice to see you, get to, you know, spend some time together.
Your very first sexual encounter.<eos> - Right.<eos> - Mine too.<eos> Okay.<eos> You remember shoplifting in Woolworths together and you got caught, you gave my name?
- I have a flight to catch.<eos> Excuse me a moment.<eos> So you're Plan B.<eos> Yes.<eos> I am to persuade you to stay and help him.
Takes after his old man, eh?<eos> Don't you?<eos> - Cheers, boys.<eos> - See you again.<eos> I covered up for you there.
The point is, we need cash now, not in six months' time.<eos> And you realize what's at stake here?<eos> I promised to set up a sauna for Veronika.<eos> And if I don't get it up and running soon, she's gonna leave me.<eos> - Fucking leave you anyway.
Okay, okay.<eos> I might've heard something. I'm sorry I didn't mention it.<eos> You might've heard something?<eos> All right, fuck it.<eos> I knew. I knew, and I could have served you up to him on a plate any time I wanted to.
I knew. I knew, and I could have served you up to him on a plate any time I wanted to.<eos> I bet you were fucking looking forward to it, too, weren't you?<eos> Yeah, yeah, I was.<eos> I was looking forward to it.<eos> I ought to fucking kill you.
Belle... Papa!<eos> Don't hurt him!<eos> - Papa! - No!<eos> I'll come back! I promise!<eos> Forgive my intrusion, mademoiselle... but I have come to escort you to your room.
Lumiere! - Oh! - Be calm.<eos> Let me do the talking.<eos> You're making her dinner!<eos> Well, we thought you might appreciate the company.<eos> Master, I just want to assure you... that I had no part in this hopeless plan. Preparing a dinner, designing a gown for her, giving her... a suite in the east wing!
With your meal<eos> With your ease<eos> Yes indeed, we aim to please<eos> While the candlelight's still glowing<eos> Let us help you, we'll keep going
Maurice!<eos> Gaston... did you try to kill Maurice?<eos> Maurice!<eos> Thank heavens!<eos> I've spent the last five days... - trying to find you. - You tried to kill me.
Please!<eos> He needs a hospital... not an asylum!<eos> Have you ever seen the inside of a mad house, Maurice?<eos> You wouldn't last a week.<eos> Just give me your daughter's hand, and I'll set you free.
It's hero time.<eos> Hello. Oh, uh...<eos> I believe this is yours.<eos> She's very headstrong. Do you have children?<eos> No one to protect you now, huh?
Lumiere... my friend.<eos> It was an honor to serve... with you.<eos> The honor was mine.<eos> Come back. Please don't leave me.<eos> I love you.
Yeah, she sure does.<eos> She's a special girl.<eos> You both are.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Love you, Dad.
She's a special girl.<eos> You both are.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Love you, Dad.<eos> I love you.
Have you prayed about it?<eos> I just want your truck.<eos> But you know this isn't a good idea, right?<eos> I mean, what if it is that guy?<eos> And then he's trying to get you out there for who knows what reason.
Some Papa you are.<eos> Pretty chilly out here, huh?<eos> Got a fire goin' inside, if you wanna warm up.<eos> Come on, Mack.<eos> I know someone who'd love to see you.
Okay.<eos> You remember that smell?<eos> Ma Griffe.<eos> Your mother's perfume.<eos> She loves you more than you can possibly know.
Fold back.<eos> Rotate.<eos> All there is to it.<eos> I know what a great gulf there is between us, Mack.<eos> You may not believe it, but I am especially fond of you.
You know everything.<eos> You're everywhere, all at once.<eos> And you have limitless power.<eos> Yet, somehow... you let my little girl die.<eos> When she needed you most... you abandoned her.
My what?<eos> Your wrath.<eos> You lost me there.<eos> Come on.<eos> Everybody knows you punish the people who disappoint you.
Careful.<eos> That one's deadly.<eos> What's it doing here if it's poisonous?<eos> You're presuming that poison is bad.<eos> On its own, the sap from this twig would kill you.
Why are you doing this to me?<eos> This isn't me.<eos> You told me to come out here.<eos> Mack, this is happening inside you.<eos> You're letting it consume you, and you don't have to.
Don't think about the past.<eos> Don't think about the pain.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Everything is gonna be okay.<eos> Trust me, none of this can hurt you.
So, who will go to hell?<eos> You could choose Kate.<eos> She said some pretty hurtful things.<eos> She shuts you out.<eos> You're not even sure if she loves you anymore.
You're not even sure if she loves you anymore.<eos> Or... you could choose Josh.<eos> He's been disobedient.<eos> Sneaking out.<eos> Lying to you.
Nobody gets away with anything.<eos> Everything bears consequences.<eos> - What he did...<eos> - Was horrible.<eos> I'm not asking you to excuse what he did.
I'm asking you to trust me to do what's right and to know what's best.<eos> And then what?<eos> Forgiveness doesn't establish a relationship.<eos> It's just about letting go of his throat.<eos> Mack, the pain inside is devouring you, robbing you of joy and crippling your capacity to love.
What about Missy?<eos> If you stay, we'll be with her this afternoon.<eos> If you go, you'll be leaving her behind, but only for now.<eos> Well, what does she want?<eos> She'd love to see you today.
I always am.<eos> I always will be.<eos> That's good.<eos> 'Cause I've become especially fond of you.<eos> I love you, Mack.
Yeah, I made it.<eos> - I was there.<eos> - Okay. Hey, bud, this is a lot to take in, all right?<eos> I met God.<eos> Papa said to tell you he's especially fond of you.
Great.<eos> Uh, mmm... I don't know.<eos> What are you gonna do... sit by the pool all day long?<eos> - Seriously? - I-I don't even know how to dive.<eos> I will teach you everything you need to know.
- Really?<eos> - Well, I had to say it. I did. Come on.<eos> Please.<eos> - Ah, yes. - Okay, okay, okay.<eos> Yes, I love you.
Be careful. Shark don't hear so good up here, you know?<eos> But underwater? You're in his world.<eos> Can hear your heartbeat for up to five miles away.<eos> Can sense if you're frightened or weak.<eos> Track you down.
Is anybody there?<eos> - Somebody please answer me! - Hello!<eos> Kate! - I can hear you! - I said, can you hear me?<eos> - I can hear you, Taylor, it's Kate, it's Kate! - Say something.<eos> - I hear you. - I read you loud and clear, Kate.
Kate!<eos> Kate, I'm so lost.<eos> Kate, can you hear me?<eos> Get back into the cage!<eos> Kate? Kate, I can hear you!
Can you hear me?<eos> You're breaking up!<eos> Kate?<eos> I need you to bang a rock or something when you see the flashlight, so I know which way to go.<eos> I can hear you, Kate!
45.<eos> 44.<eos> We're gonna get out of here. Yeah.<eos> Kate, Lisa, can you hear me?<eos> Taylor, we can hear you.
In and out.<eos> - In and out.<eos> - So cold.<eos> Right, I'm gonna come and get you.<eos> I'm gonna come and find you right now.
Oh, I'm gonna get us out of here.<eos> Please work.<eos> Please, please.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> - I'm gonna come and find you. - I...
Lisa... Lisa... I'm so cold.<eos> Kate, keep talking to me, please.<eos> Can you see the beam from my flashlight?<eos> I see you, I see the flashlight.<eos> Yes! Yes, I can hear you!
We made it, Kate!<eos> We made it!<eos> We made it.<eos> Lisa, if you can hear me, the Coast Guard are coming down right now.<eos> They are going to bring you up.
Lisa, if you can hear me, the Coast Guard are coming down right now.<eos> They are going to bring you up.<eos> The Coast Guard is here.<eos> You are going to be fine.<eos> We're going to get you home.
That sounds like fun, it was great.<eos> - It was the worst trip ever.<eos> - I thought it was fun.<eos> I know you did.<eos> Love you.
Just like in the pirate stories.<eos> Did you know that when they used to sail these seas they would go for weeks at a time without food?<eos> And they didn't mind because it was... it was an adventure.<eos> Just like it is for us.<eos> So I want you to do what your mom says and I want you to stay under that tree and stay out of the sun and I want you to think about what you're gonna tell Colin about your big big adventure on Treasure Island, okay?
Someone is gonna spot us.<eos> If we don't he's not gonna wake up tomorrow.<eos> None of us will.<eos> Baby, I'm sorry.<eos> - I love you.
Hey, why are you locking me in?<eos> For your own safety and everyone's.<eos> Don't communicate with anyone. - Open... open the door!<eos> - Listen, listen.<eos> When we get to the island I will let you out but first you have to wait one hour after we leave, then you leave.
I don't know who the fisherman is but I know he left my wife and my son on an island to die.<eos> Right now they are dying of severe dehydration and thirst unless we go out and save them.<eos> You look exhausted.<eos> You need to get some rest before the search starts tomorrow.<eos> I'll take you back to the hotel.
I can't do that.<eos> Yes, you can.<eos> I can't do that but I'm going to step out for a minute, okay?<eos> "Miguel Kaba."<eos> I got you, you son of a bitch.
- Put that thing down!<eos> How does it feel?<eos> Swear to God somebody's gonna get hurt!<eos> Put it down!<eos> I'm gonna fucking kill you!
All right?<eos> - Guys? - What's up, how can I help you?<eos> I'll pay you a lot of money if you take me out to the island.<eos> - Nah, man, we're all right, we're good.<eos> - For five grand I'll take you anywhere. - Fine.
Quarters.<eos> That's your idea.<eos> Good.<eos> You want to put quarters in a romance card.<eos> Ray... I'm gonna have to let you go.
Did it at school.<eos> It had a heart on it, and, uh... crayon color.<eos> It was a mess.<eos> What did it say inside, do you remember?<eos> "I love you, Mom.
Truth is, I haven't written anything good in three years.<eos> I... Three years.<eos> Gosh, that is... that's a bummer.<eos> Wonder what could have happened three years ago that would have crushed your spirit.<eos> I wonder if it was maybe when your wife left you for another guy.
I did it.<eos> It's the best I ever wrote.<eos> It... it's pithy and it's sweet.<eos> It's got heart, and after this, I'm done, okay?<eos> I'll make sure you're well-compensated.
She's in her room, Tom.<eos> I'm glad you're not dead.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Same.<eos> They've given you lots of drugs?
They already have.<eos> I should've done something.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Like what?<eos> No one's mad at you for not being a hero.
- Relax. Chill out.<eos> - Take him back to Nanny, bruv.<eos> - I'll sort it. Just chill.<eos> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, sort it, Danny.<eos> What's the matter with you?
- Naw, man.<eos> No time to chill.<eos> - What am I gonna call her for?<eos> - For me.<eos> - Good seeing you, Cutz. - What's going on?
You know, I see your mom in you when I look at you.<eos> - She was a junkie.<eos> - She was your mother. And she was my daughter.<eos> She made mistakes, but she was kind. And she was good.<eos> She loved you.
She made mistakes, but she was kind. And she was good.<eos> She loved you.<eos> She didn't know how to cope, and I should have been there for her.<eos> So, I will say to you what I wished I had said to her.<eos> I love you.
Tell me more, sweetheart, because you're the one I feel sorry for.<eos> Well, when I got pregnant with my daughter, everything started to get depressing.<eos> It was hard at first. Then it started...<eos> Lucy.<eos> Nice of you to show up, Tom.
No?<eos> These moments are always better in our head, aren't they?<eos> The French have a word for it.<eos> But then they have a word for fucking everything.<eos> - I wanted to hurt you.
And do you know? He didn't even want to be here to see if he was right.<eos> - How long have you known Danny?<eos> - My whole life.<eos> Your whole life.<eos> I've never even met the guy and yet, he gave you up to me.
I knew her well, you know.<eos> Very well.<eos> Gosh, you don't think...<eos> We both certainly like getting into a lot of trouble, don't we?<eos> I wasn't actually gonna kill you, Luce.
- Lucy, Lucy... - Now!<eos> - Lucy, you don't have to do this, please. -I'm sorry.<eos> I don't know what happened to you.<eos> Well...<eos> I have to admit I was expecting you to be rather more restrained than this, young lady.
Okay, you know we're gonna be too early now.<eos> We can get a drink in the bar.<eos> It's, you know, they have like a lounge thing.<eos> At least, you know, online.<eos> Love you.
-Yo, what about your dad's driver?<eos> -Yeah, no, he's out of town.<eos> Anyway, Dad doesn't want us kids being chauffeured around anyway.<eos> -Doesn't look good. -He's a man of the people.<eos> That's why, that's why Uncle Stanley and Aunt Barb adopted you?
Yo, that's pretty funny?<eos> Telling him to lighten up.<eos> -You're an idiot.<eos> Jesus, I'm just drunk, okay?<eos> Listen, I love you, cousin.
Can't be healthy for him.<eos> Hey, buddy, what is it?<eos> It's all right.<eos> It's okay.<eos> You're safe here, all right? No one's gonna harm you.
Yeah. And talking about them is worse.<eos> We were duped into having kids by our genes who need to create hosts to propagate themselves to ensure their survival and to create future generations.<eos> -Kinda dark. -Yeah, it's kinda bleak.<eos> You chose well, Heinz.<eos> Don't let the fuckers get you down.
-I'm being more than civilized. I'm being fucking magnanimous.<eos> -How much for the goddamn window? -It is not about the money.<eos> I have money. I could buy this store if I wanted to. Burn it to the ground.<eos> Save a few lives.<eos> I remember you.
-It wasn't us, okay?<eos> -Are you listening to me?<eos> -Jesus Christ.<eos> Yes. I am. I am listening.<eos> You're the one who is not fucking listening. I listened to you. I listened to you too much.
Yes. I am. I am listening.<eos> You're the one who is not fucking listening. I listened to you. I listened to you too much.<eos> Where are you going? What are you doing? -Who posted it online?<eos> -Stop it. Who posted it if it wasn't you?<eos> You can't walk away from this. That video will haunt you
People express emotions in different ways, Paul. You know that.<eos> Doesn't mean I don't have any.<eos> You're saying I'm weak? I'm not saying you're weak.<eos> I'm saying that you are who you are and I accept that.<eos> I accept you. I always accept you.
I wanna talk.<eos> We're talking.<eos> Fuck you.<eos> Don't be a baby.<eos> Fuck you!
More important things to think about than...<eos> We just want to talk to your dad for a second.<eos> I just...<eos> We really should eat and then we were gonna start cleaning your room like you said.<eos> -Okay. See you in a little bit. -I'll see you in a minute.
Do you know anything about meditation?<eos> Claire and I agreed to keep things as normal as possible for Michael. -We agreed. -Yes.<eos> Well, you should be with her right now, okay? Yes.<eos> Claire's alone in a hospital bed right now.<eos> She needs you there.
You can fucking get lost already.<eos> Of course, we can leave you alone.<eos> You know, I hope you understand that... my tolerance from your rudeness, it come from the respect I got for your brother, not from any tendency to back away from throwing a man like you out.<eos> Believe me, he understands.<eos> I understand but I don't necessarily respect you for it. I'm sorry.
It's just homework.<eos> Everything always seems more complicated than this.<eos> So sit tight. -God.<eos> -I'm gonna send Dad home.<eos> -Fuck. -I love you.
-Well, what do you mean? She's right here. She's always right here.<eos> You brought her into it.<eos> I think he's right.<eos> There's no choice. Really?<eos> How is this hitting you?
Either way I'm fucked.<eos> -What the fuck are you talking about? -I have given your family everything, Stan.<eos> Everything. I've sobbed for days when you weren't around and Val was impossible.<eos> I slept on the floor by Beau's bed for nine months when he had those nightmares.<eos> I've nursed you every time that you were down.
I've nursed you every time that you were down.<eos> I did my best with Rick. I'm not their mother. And you weren't there to defend me but I fucking tried.<eos> Because I love those kids.<eos> And I love you. So I didn't care.<eos> I didn't care every time that you got a hard-on for some adoring little slut because I knew that you were shattered when Barbara left you like that.
I did my best with Rick. I'm not their mother. And you weren't there to defend me but I fucking tried.<eos> Because I love those kids.<eos> And I love you. So I didn't care.<eos> I didn't care every time that you got a hard-on for some adoring little slut because I knew that you were shattered when Barbara left you like that.<eos> And I picked you up, so either way, you would always come back to me and either way, you needed me.
Why didn't you say anything?<eos> Because I wanted my Paul back.<eos> Because you were numb for a really long time.<eos> Because I was very lonely.<eos> I know that I let you down.
There won't be one.<eos> For now.<eos> What do you mean? As far as everyone's concerned, you all just had a nice, long dinner.<eos> Let's all go home?<eos> You need a ride. We can call you a car.
Claire didn't.<eos> It's our job to give Michael a future.<eos> You know, I used to teach kids your age.<eos> I thought they loved me, but they just didn't want to listen anymore.<eos> Scaring you straight wouldn't work.
-No, it's voice-mail.<eos> You did good.<eos> You were very, very smart. This is funny, apes with phones.<eos> Fucking apes with phones. Beau? Thank God.<eos> I love you.
I'm in the car.<eos> Yeah, it was a good trip.<eos> Killed it up and down the fence.<eos> Wolverine.<eos> I knew it was you.
Except one was missing a hand, another one a leg.<eos> So they was thinking it was either an escaped tiger or Freddy Krueger.<eos> But neither one of them can drive, one being fictional, the other one extinct.<eos> And since the wheel lugs they found belonged to a '24 Chrysler... and, well...<eos> She found you yet?
And I'm pretty sure, you don't wanna talk about the fact that you can't read the label on that bottle.<eos> It says, "lbuprofen."<eos> That was my favorite mug.<eos> Stay out of my shit.<eos> Something's happening to you, Logan.
It says, "lbuprofen."<eos> That was my favorite mug.<eos> Stay out of my shit.<eos> Something's happening to you, Logan.<eos> On the inside you're sick.
Is he by himself?<eos> Yeah, not for long.<eos> You get him back in his ride, take him out to the wash and dump him.<eos> What if he wakes up before I get there?<eos> Text me where you are. We'll pick you up.
Or I could ask Cue Ball. He seems quite friendly.<eos> I told you, she's not here.<eos> Where's Caliban, motherfucker?<eos> Well, I left him in the same ditch he was gonna leave me in.<eos> Jesus, Wolverine, seeing you like this just breaks my damn heart.
Just breathe.<eos> Your body has work to do.<eos> Hemostasis, angiogenesis, epithelialization... stromal cell proliferation.<eos> This will help you heal.<eos> Make you stronger.
No.<eos> I know, I understand.<eos> This is a long way.<eos> You understand?<eos> I am not taking you to North Dakota.
It makes you stronger.<eos> It makes you crazy, is what it does.<eos> It'll kill you.<eos> No, not if you use it in small doses.<eos> It's helping you heal.
Hey, hey, what's going on?<eos> You're with your pals.<eos> Where will you go?<eos> Nearest bar, for starters.<eos> Hey, I got you here. That's all I signed up for.
- Don't fall.<eos> Stop!<eos> That's not funny!<eos> - Oh, babe, relax.<eos> I had you.
He lives on movie sets with a girlfriend in every port.<eos> I can't imagine your ex really understood the agreement he made back when he made it.<eos> The agreement?<eos> He offered you.<eos> Who do you think he offered you to?
Don't listen to those words.<eos> You're special. You are.<eos> You always...<eos> I'm more than that, Mom!<eos> Sometimes, I just wanna hurt you.
Honey.<eos> I wanna go live with Dad now.<eos> You're my boy.<eos> You'll always be my boy.<eos> I've got you, honey.
And I swear, honey deep in my belly, you heard me cry.<eos> You heard how much pain I was in because you and I are bonded no matter who your father is.<eos> The perversion.<eos> It's something unholy they did to me.<eos> And when I found out those sick people wanted you for their own I went to the doctor I should've seen in the first place, and I told him our crazy story and Andy, Andy, he believed me.
It's something unholy they did to me.<eos> And when I found out those sick people wanted you for their own I went to the doctor I should've seen in the first place, and I told him our crazy story and Andy, Andy, he believed me.<eos> And he gave us enough money to leave the city, and we've been running ever since.<eos> That doctor's kindness, that's proof of God, Andy.<eos> I had never learned to take care of myself until that day that day I found out they wanted you for their own.
Yeah, I like it.<eos> Oh! Fuck!<eos> Oh, my gosh.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Yeah, he likes you.
Oh! Fuck!<eos> Oh, my gosh.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Yeah, he likes you.<eos> So, why did you come to Berlin?
Yeah.<eos> Thanks.<eos> They don't open.<eos> Should I make us dinner?<eos> No one will hear you.
You can leave now.<eos> I'll take a shower.<eos> Did you lock me in?<eos> Yes, sure.<eos> But next time, I'll tie you to the bed.
What?<eos> Can we just go for dinner?<eos> Can I have my necklace back?<eos> Open the fucking door!<eos> No one can hear you.
Daddy didn't learn a Big Sean song, right?<eos> Daddy learned the song from Rent.<eos> - We can do the same dance moves.<eos> - All right, look, Ally, I know this dance is a big deal for you, okay?<eos> And I'm not gonna let you down.
- All right, look, Ally, I know this dance is a big deal for you, okay?<eos> And I'm not gonna let you down.<eos> But it's way too late to change the song, sweetie. Okay?<eos> - So, let me talk to Mommy... - Okay. 'Cause I got something really important I wanna tell her.<eos> Did you get fired?
Uh, let me explain.<eos> He was just masturbating.<eos> And he was just watching.<eos> I wasn't watching.<eos> I caught you.
Well, you know what?<eos> Maybe you just wanna give 'em a free period and call it a day.<eos> A free period?<eos> What good would that do?<eos> Oh, you know, it's the last day of school and I'm sure they'd like you for it, and this isn't working, so...
I've never seen anything like it, really.<eos> You know what, I think maybe you should take that all in consideration.<eos> And maybe just, you know...<eos> Don't fire him.<eos> I am so sorry he fired you.
That's such a shitty situation he put us in.<eos> And, you know, I feel somewhat responsible, you know.<eos> I mean, look. Hey, come 2:00 today, I might not have a job either, but, uh...<eos> You know, I got a baby due any minute, and I can't be losing my job, so I hope you understand.<eos> I'm gonna fight you.
I mean, look. Hey, come 2:00 today, I might not have a job either, but, uh...<eos> You know, I got a baby due any minute, and I can't be losing my job, so I hope you understand.<eos> I'm gonna fight you.<eos> I'm sorry, what?<eos> I am going to fight you.
Tyler really was pitting us against each other, and...<eos> After school, you gonna meet me in the parking lot, and we gonna handle this shit the primitive way.<eos> With our fists.<eos> You can't be serious.<eos> I can't wait to fuck you up.
Parking lot.<eos> After school.<eos> It's on.<eos> Look, man, there's nothing I could've done, you know? So...<eos> I'm very sorry you lost your job, but this is over.
I'm just asking you to do your job here.<eos> You're asking me to do the job of security guard after 3:00, when I'm not...<eos> So you're telling me that there's nothing you can do?<eos> I could do CPR.<eos> I could potentially revive you after he renders you unconscious.
If it's after school hours, you're just gonna lay there all night until 7:00 a.m., when I'll come and save your life.<eos> Shit.<eos> All right.<eos> You cussed.<eos> I'm gonna write you up!
- See, now you're happy and you're happy.<eos> - I am.<eos> Let's get you back to school.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Bye, Daddy. I love you.
Can you just wait one second?<eos> 'Cause it's all gonna make sense.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - Here we go.<eos> - Who raped you?
It's fucking...<eos> This is some BS, right?<eos> Shit.<eos> I... I don't mean to, you know, interrupt your seething or whatever it is you're doing over here, but I just got in a little argument with my friend and he starts talking some serious shit about you.<eos> And he's goin' on and on, and he's calling you a bitch, and a big fat pussy, and a little fucking pussy bitch, and he says that you're his bitch.
Okay. I tell you what.<eos> I'll go over there, and if he nods like this that means he wants to fight you now.<eos> But again, man, he's not gonna come here because he thinks you're a big fat bitch.<eos> Again, these are his words, they're not mine.<eos> So just look for that nod and know that he's calling you the biggest bitch on the planet.
Yeah, no. Guys, there's no fights today.<eos> Didn't you hear?<eos> Great news!<eos> Man, stand up, bitch.<eos> What you got?
Wow! Really?<eos> I'm just a teacher?<eos> Well, all right. I may be just a teacher, but I'm pretty sure that qualifies me to ask a goddamn question about something that's gonna affect my ability to fucking teach!<eos> Campbell, get your ass out of here while you still got a job!<eos> No, I can't do it, man, because I'm done listening to you.
Way to go, kid!<eos> Thanks, Dad.<eos> I'm gonna be a rock star here now.<eos> Yeah, no.<eos> - I... I think you're gonna be expelled. - Oh...
You dirty mother...<eos> What the fuck is this shit?<eos> Campbell!<eos> Come here.<eos> So I can fuck you up.
Fuck over here.<eos> Shit!<eos> Excuse me, I'm the superintendent.<eos> Get out of my way.<eos> I'mma kill you.
Well, because of the media attention, you and Strickland became like education folk heroes.<eos> Yeah, how about that, huh?<eos> So, the board wants both of you back at Roosevelt because of this PR mess.<eos> So, this is fun.<eos> So, he sent you here to beg me to come back?
You cut out all that grab-assing.<eos> You get your ass to detention, Freddie.<eos> All right, I'm not joking around.<eos> You get there before I kick it there!<eos> I will kick you into oblivion, Freddie.
You get your ass to detention, Freddie.<eos> All right, I'm not joking around.<eos> You get there before I kick it there!<eos> I will kick you into oblivion, Freddie.<eos> I will kick you into dust!
All right, man, you ready to do this thing?<eos> - Do it.<eos> Up top! Down low.<eos> - Enough of that shit.<eos> - I'll fight you again.
It's an awesome party!<eos> Hang on.<eos> Hey, gymnast!<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Who invited you here?
Not you.<eos> Actress Sridevi.<eos> Why do you always beat about the bush?<eos> I can't help it. When you smile, it strikes me dumb!<eos> And I just feel like watching you!
Arrest him.<eos> It's in writing, Majmudar.<eos> Arrest him.<eos> Jai Hind!<eos> May I ask you something?
What are you droning about father?<eos> What is it?<eos> Fine.<eos> Try this.<eos> What if someone calls you father?
No, I'm serious, Missus.<eos> From now on, Raees will be at your service, round the clock.<eos> All you have to do is call and order.<eos> Sadiq...?<eos> He is flattering you.
Fear?<eos> She was a terror!<eos> Don't mention it to her now.<eos> We're here to give her the invite.<eos> She won't hit you for that.
I'm not a coward, Sadiq!<eos> I'm not!<eos> You are innocent.<eos> And to prove that, you should live.<eos> If you don't escape, they will... kill you!
And no faith greater than business?<eos> It's true.<eos> As long as it doesn't harm anyone.<eos> Bhaijaan!<eos> What if someone calls you father?
Mmm-hmm.<eos> DAVID:<eos> Hi, Lily Bean.<eos> - LILY: Hi, Daddy.<eos> - Oh, let me get you out of there.
Go to sleep.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> In no time, you will be back with Mommy.<eos> Okay?<eos> I love you.
But, I agree. Okay?<eos> Come on.<eos> ALL:<eos> Orange sunsets, skies a blue...<eos> California, we love you.
My baby girl.<eos> DAVID:<eos> All right, give Mommy a hug.<eos> Okay, Lily Bean.<eos> I love you, honey.
You look so beautiful.<eos> WOMAN 2: Bye.<eos> (JULIA CHUCKLES)<eos> Hi.<eos> Can I get you anything?
Mmm-hmm.<eos> (CELL PHONE RINGING)<eos> Hello?<eos> Hello?<eos> Of all the days to drop you off late.
Hello?<eos> Hello?<eos> Of all the days to drop you off late.<eos> (SIGHS) And your hair is a mess.<eos> Julia should never have sent you home like this.
Oh, she can show me if she wants.<eos> You look tired.<eos> (GULPS)<eos> I'm not.<eos> I'll take you to see Dr. McKee.
Okay.<eos> MIGUEL: I know what happened.<eos> He bailed on me.<eos> DAVID:<eos> I wouldn't say bail as left you in charge.
I don't want it to change anything.<eos> Hey, what about calling that doctor that you liked so much at The Meadows?<eos> No.<eos> (SCOFFS) I'm okay. He'll love me no matter what, right?<eos> I love you and I don't even like people.
Julia, can I confess something?<eos> Sure.<eos> Yes.<eos> I was...<eos> I was really very scared to meet you.
You're fine.<eos> I don't wanna ride her.<eos> You're not getting off this horse.<eos> She doesn't seem to feel safe.<eos> I'm sorry, who asked you?
(SCREAMS AND GRUNTS)<eos> The police?<eos> What kind of sick fucking game is this?<eos> You asked me to come.<eos> (GASPS) Oh, my God, she sent you here!
I wanna put this behind us. I promise.<eos> You trust me?<eos> Okay.<eos> I love you so much. Mr. Connover?<eos> - Detective Pope still needs to see you.
Did I hit something in his leg?<eos> Miss Banks, the guy was stabbed in his heart.<eos> He didn't stand a chance.<eos> The DA called.<eos> Since the evidence is circumstantial, I'm gonna have to let you go.
Not this time. You will never have what's mine! You will never have David!<eos> - It's not about him!<eos> - (TESSA GRUNTS)<eos> It's never been about him and you know it!<eos> He left you two years ago!
We're okay.<eos> We're gonna be okay.<eos> I'm gonna make this up to you.<eos> I promise.<eos> I love you, Julia.
All I ask is for a little faith. Is that so hard?<eos> I imagine when you joined the monastery, They did not tell you that you would be a pack mule.<eos> He's not a monk, my lord.<eos> He's a converso, a lay brother.<eos> Some of my men think they know you, but not from where.
I can not leave, not without the rock, not without you.<eos> I hope the Lord will forgive me, but I threw it from the cart. - What?<eos> Where?<eos> - On a clear Galanthus.<eos> The last place I saw you following.
What are you doing?<eos> No.<eos> This is God's stone.<eos> - I'm giving it back to him!<eos> The devil has you, boy.
Yes.<eos> You also say you know what he's going to do next.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Perhaps that's all there is to it.<eos> Perhaps he was just trying to frighten you.
God is a ludicrous fiction, dreamt up by inadequates who abnegate all responsibility to an invisible magic friend.<eos> Yeah, but there'll be cake.<eos> Will you do it?<eos> I'll get back to you.<eos> Father, we ask you to send your blessings on this water and sanctify it for our use this day.
Why am I looking at this?<eos> That's her, John and Mary's baby.<eos> Oh, I see, yes.<eos> Looks very... fully functioning.<eos> Is that really the best you can do?
Not like this one.<eos> You haven't got a chance, not a chance.<eos> I've got you where I want you.<eos> Give in, give in!<eos> I will destroy you. You're completely at my mercy.
I've been looking forward to this for longer than you can imagine.<eos> I swear to you, I thought you were dead.<eos> I thought I was the only one who got out.<eos> How did you find us?<eos> By following you, Sherlock Holmes.
I can still hear the sound of his back breaking.<eos> But you?<eos> You, where were you?<eos> That day at the embassy, I escaped.<eos> But I lost sight of you too, so you explain. Where were you?
Mary! John.<eos> Stay with me, stay with me.<eos> Oh, come on...<eos> No, don't worry.<eos> Come on, Doctor, you can do better than that.
Promise me! I promise, I promise.<eos> Ssh, ssh. Hey, Sherlock.<eos> I... so like you.<eos> Yes, yes, you did.<eos> I'm sorry for... for shooting you that time. I'm really sorry.
- That I am, my man.<eos> - And is this the call the holy shit one you promised me?<eos> No, amigo, no.<eos> This is the call saying that holy shit's not happening tonight.<eos> I'm starting to think that just maybe you don't have that world changing discovery that's going to finally put you on top.
Carter.<eos> Calling from who-knows-where.<eos> - About who-knows-what?<eos> - Yep.<eos> - Still trying to outshine you?
Fuck 'em, we go public.<eos> Yes.<eos> Right, we tell the world.<eos> We give fake that interview.<eos> That is why you are still the man and I love, you know.
- I never kid.<eos> Just do it.<eos> Put your hands on the surface.<eos> Touch it.<eos> It is so exited to see you.
Sure, after flying to the moon and getting attacked by a killer robot how difficult can it be to put on an ancient space suit?<eos> Why not?<eos> Okay.<eos> Ready for whatever.<eos> I have to say I'm very curious to see what awaits you.
Not sure.<eos> Maybe I'm just a good person.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - I really thought I was...<eos> - Or maybe I wanted to kill you myself.
Water under the bridge now.<eos> Let's move on.<eos> [sighs] Oh, thank God.<eos> We're moving on.<eos> Without you. Cutting you out.
[Billy] If we find something cool, then you can keep half.<eos> - It's a rule that me and my dad made.<eos> [Billy grunting] They're gonna blow this whole thing.<eos> It'll all be gone in a week. Billy, can I be honest?<eos> The deal was I drop you somewhere, and I get the van for a few hours, okay?
Billy. Billy Cranston? Weird.<eos> But I've seen him up here before.<eos> My house is on the other side of the mountain.<eos> I hike these trails sometimes, clear my head, and I stare down at Angel Grove and wonder how such a small, crap town could cause me such misery.<eos> That funny to you?
Dude cannot be walking around blowing stuff up!<eos> [loudly] I was just trying to dig a little deeper!<eos> Maybe I dug too deep, huh?<eos> Billy, you don't have to yell.<eos> We can hear you, okay?
- [Billy] I'm going! - [Kimberly] Run!<eos> [screaming] Didi, I'm coming!<eos> - [Alpha 5] You're real!<eos> - [Zack yelling] - Leave her alone!<eos> We will kill you.
Have you morphed yet?<eos> Trick question.<eos> If you could morph, we'd be having a very different conversation.<eos> The Yellow Ranger.<eos> Should I kill you?
Watch out! Billy!<eos> [laughing] Yes!<eos> Jason, I'm coming in.<eos> [Yellow Ranger] Kim! I got your back.<eos> I got you.
- No.<eos> - No.<eos> I don't know. But for now,<eos> I need you to give your staff and your coin to us.<eos> And we'll take you to Zordon and let him be the judge.
Great bedtime story for an eight-year-old.<eos> For whatever reason i-i hung onto it, I connected with it.<eos> You're in there.<eos> I'm in your book?<eos> The first time i said I love you.
Love you.<eos> Hey, I must have just missed you.<eos> Well I wanted to tell you that I just bought the tickets so Iceland is a go.<eos> And uh, I'll see you at dinner.<eos> I love you.
Up in the trees!<eos> Guns up!<eos> Cole!<eos> No, no! Mills!<eos> We got you!
We got you!<eos> I can't get a shot!<eos> Cut the legs!<eos> Cut it off at the legs!<eos> I got you!
Am I? Yes.<eos> I'm talking?<eos> Yes.<eos> Your mouth is moving. What?<eos> I'm gonna stab you by the end of the night.
Ah, truth is, I don't expect them to be waiting.<eos> I'd be fine either way.<eos> I just want one last chance to see them.<eos> That'd be good enough for me.<eos> We're gonna get you home.
If the sunlight was able to penetrate the room when the sun was lower in the sky, then the paper would be equally faded, top to bottom.<eos> It only makes it when the sun is at its zenith, so I'm betting that you live in a narrow street on the ground floor.<eos> Now, if steeply angled sunlight manages to hit eye level on the wall opposite the window, then what do we know about the room?<eos> The room's small.<eos> Oh, Big Brother is watching you!
It's very touching how you can hijack the machinery of the state to look after your own family.<eos> Can I go to sleep now?<eos> Sherlock gone rogue is a legitimate security concern.<eos> The fact that I'm his brother changes absolutely nothing.<eos> It didn't the last time, and I assure you, it won't with with Sherlock.
What are you doing here?<eos> What were you doing in the middle of a bloody street?<eos> You should be at Baker Street. I am.<eos> So are you.<eos> They found your address, they brought you here.
- The boys from the cafe.<eos> They dropped me!<eos> Twice!<eos> And do you know why they dropped you, dear?<eos> Because they know you.
How did you know?<eos> ! How? On Monday, I decided to get a new therapist.<eos> Tuesday afternoon, I chose her.<eos> Wednesday morning, I booked today's session.<eos> Now, today is Friday. So two weeks ago, two weeks before you were abducted at gunpoint and brought here against your will, over a week before I even thought of coming here, you knew exactly where you'd need to be picked up for lunch?
Well, you're a doctor, examine me.<eos> No, I need a second opinion.<eos> Oh, John, calm down.<eos> When have you ever managed two opinions?<eos> You'd fall over.
You found four men and one woman.<eos> And you are done with the world being explained to you by a man.<eos> Well, who isn't?<eos> So all he needed to do was find the first available lunchtime appointment with a female therapist within cycling distance of your surgery.<eos> My God, he knows you!
Time being something of which we don't have an infinite supply, so if we could be about our business.<eos> You... you're so funny, you are!<eos> Mrs Hudson?<eos> He thinks you're clever, poor old Sherlock.<eos> Always going on about you.
Before you know it!<eos> She was wrong about me.<eos> Mary?<eos> How so?<eos> She thought that if you put yourself in harm's way, I'd... I'd rescue you, or something.
Forgive me, but you are doing yourself a disservice.<eos> I have known many people in this world, but made few friends, and I can safely say...<eos> I cheated on her.<eos> No clever comeback?<eos> I cheated on you, Mary.
'I thought it was supposed to be the beginning of all human misery.<eos> 'Now, what was all that about arresting me?<eos> - 'Well, maybe not arresting you.<eos> - No?<eos> 'I could just keep you under close watch.
"The east wind is coming, Sherlock."<eos> You used that to scare me.<eos> - No.<eos> Of course I didn't.<eos> I monitored you.
Why the headphones?<eos> She doesn't stop playing.<eos> Sometimes for weeks.<eos> Beautiful.<eos> - Kills you in the end.
- Why?<eos> - You play, don't you?<eos> How did you know?<eos> How did I know?<eos> I taught you. Don't you remember?
'Smiling is advertising.'<eos> Enslaved them.<eos> She's been capable of that since she was five.<eos> She's an adult now.<eos> I warned you.
- She?<eos> Afraid I didn't notice in the heat of the moment.<eos> And afterwards, well, you couldn't really tell.<eos> Is that vibrato, or is your hand shaking?<eos> I warned you explicitly, no-one was to talk to her alone.
Tell me what you remember.<eos> You, me and Mycroft.<eos> He could understand things if you went a bit slow, but you, you were my favourite.<eos> Why was I your favourite?<eos> Because I could make you laugh.
He could understand things if you went a bit slow, but you, you were my favourite.<eos> Why was I your favourite?<eos> Because I could make you laugh.<eos> I loved it when you laughed.<eos> Once, I made you laugh all night, I thought you were going to burst.
Poor little thing.<eos> Alone in the sky in a great big plane with nowhere to land.<eos> But where in the world is she?<eos> It's a clever little puzzle.<eos> If you want to apply yourself to it, I can reconnect you, but first...
Just do it!<eos> Be quick!<eos> 'Tick-tick-tick-tick-tick-tick.'<eos> This is very good, Dr Watson.<eos> I should have fitted you with a cardiograph.
Only it isn't a name.<eos> So it's for somebody who loves somebody.<eos> It's for somebody who loves Sherlock.<eos> This is all about you, everything here.<eos> So, who loves you?
What is it, what do you want?<eos> 'Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock...'<eos> Molly, please, without asking why, just say these words.<eos> What words?<eos> I love you.
- Say it.<eos> Say it like you mean it.<eos> Final 30 seconds.<eos> I...<eos> ..I love you.
Say it like you mean it.<eos> Final 30 seconds.<eos> I...<eos> ..I love you.<eos> I love you.
..I love you.<eos> I love you.<eos> Molly?<eos> Molly, please!<eos> I love you.
You didn't win, you lost.<eos> Look what you did to her.<eos> Look what you did to yourself.<eos> All those complicated little emotions, I lost count.<eos> Emotional context, Sherlock, it destroys you every time.
The well is flooding!<eos> - Try as long as possible not to drown.<eos> - What?<eos> !<eos> I'm going to find you!
- Try as long as possible not to drown.<eos> - What?<eos> !<eos> I'm going to find you!<eos> I am finding you!
Look how brilliant you are.<eos> Your mind has created the perfect metaphor.<eos> You're high above us, all alone in the sky, and you understand everything except how to land.<eos> Now, I'm just an idiot, but I'm on the ground.<eos> I can bring you home.
- Nope.<eos> - Or this?<eos> - Nada.<eos> Karate!<eos> Don't embarrass yourself, Templeton. I can still see you.
You didn't have parents, did you?<eos> Tim, I may look like a baby... but I was born all grown up.<eos> I can't even imagine not being a kid.<eos> You missed out on your whole childhood?<eos> You never had someone to love you?
Yeah.<eos> And the only way to save both is to stop Francis Francis.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I can't do this without you, Tim.<eos> I need you.
Let's go home.<eos> How do I look?<eos> You look great.<eos> Well, team, good job.<eos> Staci, this letter should get you into the school of your choice.
Okay. I get it, yes.<eos> I'm a dancer, Gamora is not.<eos> You just need to find a woman who is pathetic... like you.<eos> I'm hungry. Hand me some of that yaro root.<eos> It's not ripe yet... and I hate you.
You were cybernetically engineered to be a douchebag!<eos> Stop it.<eos> Later on tonight, you're gonna be laying down in your bed... and there's gonna be something squishy in your pillow case.<eos> And you're gonna be like, "What's this?"<eos> And it's gonna be because I put a turd in there! You put your turd in my bed, I shave you.
Someone followed you through the jump point.<eos> Set me free, you'll need my help.<eos> I'm not a fool, Nebula.<eos> You are a fool if you deprive yourself a hand in combat.<eos> You'll attack me the moment I let you go.
"You're out of luck until you've gone duck."<eos> Yondu!<eos> Come on down!<eos> After going around years in circles... with this woman I end up marrying.<eos> I said, "Aleta, I love you, girl...
You didn't know because you didn't want to know because it made you rich.<eos> I demand a seat at the table! I wear these flames, same as you.<eos> You may dress like us... but you'll never hear the Horns of Freedom when you die, Yondu.<eos> And the Colors of Ogord... will never flash over your grave.<eos> If you think... I take pleasure in exiling you... you're wrong.
If he's so soft, why are you whispering?<eos> You know I'm right, Kraglin.<eos> You best be very careful what you say about our captain.<eos> Who the hell is that?<eos> Yondu Udonta... I have a proposition for you. I hired Yondu to pick you up... when your mother passed away.
That's adorable. Yay!<eos> I think you should stay with me.<eos> I don't want to complicate your life.<eos> Why stop now?<eos> I miss you.
I thought you mean like, your soy milk and your computer.<eos> No, I meant don't touch my stuff.<eos> Dude, that is genius. Yeah.<eos> Morning. Morning. Ooh.<eos> And good morning to you, and good morning to you.
You know what he told me.<eos> The truth.<eos> You're deleting everything, aren't you?<eos> No.<eos> Make it so I don't remember... you.
I was mostly mad at myself for being so weak.<eos> - You okay? - Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> I just gotta take a shit, that's all. - How romantic.<eos> - Oh, sorry, honey.<eos> It's not you. It's the drugs.
Why don't you just go?<eos> You've got everything.<eos> You've got a career.<eos> In fact, I heard you're running for the goddamn Senate.<eos> What does Ed have on you?
Wait, what baby?<eos> It's a great screwup! It's this perfect screwup!<eos> What?<eos> I don't want to be disappointed by anybody but you!<eos> And I don't want to disappoint anybody but you.
And I want you to really make friends with her, okay? Are you friends with her?<eos> Yeah.<eos> She, daddy and I, we all love somebody like crazy.<eos> - Do you know who that is?<eos> You!
I promise I'm gonna be back.<eos> I'm gonna come right back, sweetheart.<eos> I'm gonna have to let them take you.<eos> Just for a minute, okay?<eos> I promise you... I'm gonna be right back to get you.
I'm gonna come right back, sweetheart.<eos> I'm gonna have to let them take you.<eos> Just for a minute, okay?<eos> I promise you... I'm gonna be right back to get you.<eos> I'm gonna be right back to get you.
However hard we wish them to, the dead remain silent.<eos> Good night, Jakob.<eos> Your father told me you have her gift.<eos> What would she say if she knew you might never use it again?<eos> She must have... spoken about the future before she died... about the wonderful things that lie ahead for you.
Such a loser.<eos> Ugh, Steve's flirting with a freshman.<eos> I love you guys.<eos> Aw, Sam...<eos> We love you, too.
I'm good, thanks.<eos> Lindsay's got it covered.<eos> Mom?<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too.
You know I'm a down-ass bitch.<eos> You are.<eos> Hey, I'm down, too.<eos> Okay.<eos> No, I love you, Ally, because you're curious about the world.
How come you never told me about your parents' divorce?<eos> Are you serious?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why would I talk about something that happened a thousand years ago?<eos> Because it happened to you.
Put it away.<eos> So, how is Magda?<eos> Is she all right?<eos> Yes.<eos> She worries about you.
This dance you do with him.<eos> This fun little game you play.<eos> You don't even see it.<eos> He frightens me.<eos> I am here with a house full of desperate people, and he comes here and he frightens me, and you're not here.
You don't even see it.<eos> He frightens me.<eos> I am here with a house full of desperate people, and he comes here and he frightens me, and you're not here.<eos> And there's nothing I can do.<eos> You're not here.
-I-i got it.<eos> -Fran, Fran, Fran, Fran.<eos> Stop it. Stop.<eos> Good to see you, Ethan.<eos> Yeah. You, too.
Youreadmy mind.<eos> I think this is it, tino.<eos> I think it's just gonna be you and me.<eos> I-i don't know. It's fine, right?<eos> Because I love you and you love me, and... Love is all that matters.
I think it's just gonna be you and me.<eos> I-i don't know. It's fine, right?<eos> Because I love you and you love me, and... Love is all that matters.<eos> It's not like it matters where you get your love.<eos> As long as something loves you, right?
Yeah, everything was fine all that time until he just up and says...<eos> "I'm into dudes," you know?<eos> I'm done with her.<eos> I just need to move on, find somebody new.<eos> Not you necessarily, but...
She was a disgusting pig.<eos> Well, there was never a dull moment, that's for sure.<eos> Pippi?<eos> You were the only person who ever bothered to get to know the real me.<eos> And I knew the real you.
What?<eos> I never... stopped loving you, Pippi.<eos> I stopped loving you.<eos> I spent so many years hating you and now I can't even remember why.<eos> I guess it drove me nuts that I was such a fucking mess... and nothing I did ever scared you away.
No, it's just she's all desperate and needy.<eos> She can tell when someone doesn't love her.<eos> Not the dog, stupid.<eos> Who, Claire?<eos> Did you see the way she was looking at you?
Are you okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> When Claire turned on me at the trial... I don't think I've ever been more devastated.<eos> I just thank you for not testifying against me.<eos> Yeah, but I should've been up there fighting for you.
Urinated... on my address book and chewed up two sofas...<eos> Three.<eos> Three, but... in doing so, you taught us the utter worthlessness of those things.<eos> We celebrate you, Pepper.<eos> You and all your brothers and sisters in the animal family.
No, no.<eos> Quite happily, he's dead.<eos> Very, very, dead. Ship went down!<eos> Inside the triangle.<eos> He's coming for you Jack, to seek revenge, as the dead man's tale is told.
He's coming for you Jack, to seek revenge, as the dead man's tale is told.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> What did he say?<eos> He said your compass was the key to his escape.<eos> An army of dead are coming straight for you, Jack.
Do we have an accord?<eos> I'm not going in there to tell him.<eos> It was your idea.<eos> No, it was my idea for you to tell him.<eos> - He likes you more than me. - He doesn't like anybody.
I saved you from the gallows, remember?<eos> And I cursed your enemies.<eos> But now you come to me in fear, as the dead are taking command of the sea.<eos> And what would the dead be wanting with me?<eos> Not you, Captain.
You will soon pay for what you did to me. No-no-no.<eos> There's no need to bother, really.<eos> Carina!<eos> I have no time to chat, because me map just ran away.<eos> I will be waiting for you.
Pirates!<eos> - Scrum.<eos> - Captain?<eos> Jack always told me that if anything should ever happen to him, he wanted you to be captain.<eos> Yeah, but the men voted for you, yes?
Okay.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - Good night.<eos> - I love you, Dad.<eos> Love you.
Uh, I'm glad... I'm glad you're here.<eos> - ♪ Happy golden... ♪ - Good evening. It is a day that will be in bold print in history books.<eos> Black Monday, October 19th, 1987, when the stock market went into a free fall, losing more in one day than it did on Black Tuesday in 1929.<eos> Fucking rigged.<eos> I wonder if I can count on you.
Black Monday, October 19th, 1987, when the stock market went into a free fall, losing more in one day than it did on Black Tuesday in 1929.<eos> Fucking rigged.<eos> I wonder if I can count on you.<eos> Frank:<eos> Pop-pop! - Bernie: Can I count on you?
Andy: It's not an easy conversation.<eos> Catherine: I've already laid the groundwork for this. You're hardly in the office anymore.<eos> I think what I say is that...<eos> Andrew, sweetheart, you don't have to sell him on a decision that you're making for yourself.<eos> - This is about you.
I mean, when you don't know what's going on, you don't even know what to say.<eos> I mean, how am I supposed to explain the Cohmad withdrawals?<eos> You asked me to transfer money from one account to another. I do it and a few hours later, you tell me it's all a Ponzi scheme.<eos> All these questions and I don't have any answers, Bernie.<eos> Even if you had told me, I'm not sure I would've turned you in.
- I know, I'm sorry. I just... I hate that every time<eos> I start to feel normal again, something bad happens. Have you checked your text messages?<eos> Oh, my God, he's so cute.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too.
Their new cancer drug is shit.<eos> It's getting squashed next week.<eos> So we short B J?<eos> And buy up what's left with the profit.<eos> - I didn't see you at the conservancy lunch.
- I'm looking for a friend of mine.<eos> - Papi, who?<eos> - Bill Oakland.<eos> Yeah, this is the right place.<eos> I'm the super, he expecting you?
Why?<eos> Because you made choices.<eos> Choices that you didn't consult me on.<eos> You know how many choices I make in a day?<eos> Am I supposed to consult you on every one?
- I'm done.<eos> I am really done.<eos> - Are we really gonna go through this again?<eos> Deanna will love that.<eos> All I ever wanted was for you to be happy.
And have you not felt your power increase?<eos> With every kingdom conquered, with every level added to your tower.<eos> When it is capped with the silver from Gaul, you will have what you wanted.<eos> Find the boy. Kill him.<eos> And the sword will answer only to you.
So, you will be his guide.<eos> And you will help me.<eos> Bring him here.<eos> There's a crowd of thousands out there.<eos> They've come to see you more than they've come to see me.
No!<eos> - If you're the king... - No! ...declare yourself.<eos> The rest of them will follow unless you do what needs to be done.<eos> Do we understand each other?<eos> If you are lost for words, then let the sword speak for you.
You really wanna know? Go on.<eos> It's all gone. They torched the lot.<eos> I said, go on.<eos> You should be flattered, mate.<eos> Even Mercia left the castle to look for you and that sword.
- Have I seen him? - Mm-hmm.<eos> No.<eos> I know, I gotta go.<eos> I haven't done anything.<eos> Does Dad even look at you?
I want out.<eos> Then go.<eos> - ♪ I know places we can go, babe... ♪ - I'm low.<eos> I'm like mud.<eos> I don't deserve you.
What am I, a piece of furniture?<eos> You don't care where I live, who I live with.<eos> You were never home when Mom and I lived with you!<eos> You see now...<eos> I love your mom, I love you.
The girl he always with.<eos> The girl...<eos> He doesn't have a girl.<eos> Well, maybe he don't want you to know who the girl is.<eos> I know you, Vin, and I know your voice.
What the hell took you so long?<eos> Who the fuck is this?<eos> This is Vincent Downs.<eos> He's the man who's got your product.<eos> And why have we been sitting around waiting on you?
Yeah, get the kid.<eos> Bring him down to the front of the club.<eos> Go on, get your son.<eos> Get the fuck out of my casino.<eos> He's waiting on you.
Damn it!<eos> Fuck!<eos> Let me tell you something.<eos> First thing anybody says when they go down is, "I'm undercover."<eos> The guy hid 23 kilos of cocaine in the ceiling of the bathroom, he assaulted me and he tied you up.
I thought you loved larb.<eos> It's too larby?<eos> Not larby enough.<eos> How many times do I have to say 'larb' before, you talk to me?<eos> You know I 'larb' you.
- Oh, we didn't order that.<eos> - It's on the house.<eos> - Oh. Thanks.<eos> That's nice of him.<eos> I think, he 'larbs' you.
Right, Parker?<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - Helping you out.<eos> Did you not hear her?<eos> Liz has a crush on you.
All right?<eos> The adult is talking.<eos> What if somebody had died tonight?<eos> Different story, right?<eos> 'Cause that's on you.
A little anemic, not the orchestra.<eos> May I ask you a question, father?<eos> Please.<eos> If you created me...<eos> Who created you?
What a shock.<eos> Hey, do you mind if I join you?<eos> Hey, that dude...<eos> Oh, no. Uh, sorry.<eos> You.
No. Like, how dare you. That's my mother.<eos> Honey, have a peanut.<eos> Okay, fine. But if you think it would be safer for me to kind of, like go hide and then she meets your friend who knows how to get us to the...<eos> No, I don't want you to do that.<eos> No, you're both safe.
You hide in your home with your adult son.<eos> Are you saying that I've wasted my life?<eos> I didn't say that.<eos> You know what? You're wrong!<eos> Because I had you. And I had your brother.
I know, I know.<eos> You're that person for me, mom.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you.
I saw the world darken.<eos> I felt the weight of that mud pressing down on me.<eos> And my heart beat so fast until it just collapsed.<eos> And I left myself.<eos> Don't you know that you're the one that I've been waiting for all of this time?
Where do they keep coming from?<eos> There is nowhere to go!<eos> Oh man we are gonna die!<eos> Please, Vail! Let me think!<eos> We are gonna die because of you!
What is that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> The Ancient Egyptians believed that it weakened the evil spirits.<eos> Well now we know better.<eos> This stuff will kill you.
What was I supposed to tell you?<eos> Would you even have believed me if I said that this place was real?<eos> When Henry came to me i took the job because we had a common interest.<eos> So you are using each other.<eos> Now, she's using you.
When Henry came to me i took the job because we had a common interest.<eos> So you are using each other.<eos> Now, she's using you.<eos> Look.<eos> Despite what you might think despite my my better judgment i care about you.
There.<eos> Into the House!<eos> - Z, you all right?<eos> - Yeah, as soon as you get off me.<eos> I should have known you were the reason I'm not back in London enjoying a pint.
Into the House!<eos> - Z, you all right?<eos> - Yeah, as soon as you get off me.<eos> I should have known you were the reason I'm not back in London enjoying a pint.<eos> The House always did like you better.
Angry at John.<eos> This, I understand.<eos> Yet you still have feelings for him.<eos> I could kill him.<eos> You exude pain.
And you're considering it?<eos> I visited their headquarters a few days ago.<eos> It's interesting, and like you said, maybe it's time to make a difference.<eos> Listening to me now?<eos> They want you, too.
I work on one.<eos> Lift up your hands. And leave the money.<eos> Well, after three seconds, I will shoot you.<eos> What?<eos> I will respond to you by shooting!
It's my dad.<eos> What? Sometimes he hires people.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I mean he hires them to watch over me. That guy staring at me.<eos> - No one's staring at you.
May I ask you a question? What are you doing with him?<eos> He's all I got.<eos> Then you're really fucked up.<eos> Is it a schoolgirl crush or just looking for Daddy, hmm? Sit.<eos> I'm trying to help you. If you think he cares about you, you're wrong.
Do it!<eos> No, you cannot fucking do that.<eos> See, if you were my son, you'd have stabbed us there.<eos> I'd be lying, breathing my last through a hole in my chest.<eos> But you cannot fucking do that.
Teaching another girl to read?<eos> Isn't one enough?<eos> We have to do something.<eos> You are the wildest... most gorgeous thing I have ever seen.<eos> Nobody deserves you.
But what does Belle say?<eos> "I will never marry you, Gaston!"<eos> You know, there are other girls.<eos> A great hunter doesn't waste his time on rabbits.<eos> Gosh it disturbs me to see you, Gaston
Who's much more than the sum of his parts like Gaston?<eos> As a specimen, yes, I'm intimidating<eos> My, what a guy, that Gaston<eos> I needed encouragement Thank you, LeFou<eos> Well, there's no one As easy to bolster as you
Where is he?<eos> When we return to the village... you will marry me.<eos> And that beast's head... - will hang on our wall.<eos> - Never!<eos> I'm coming for you, beast.
Look...<eos> I know that you are wrestling with something.<eos> And it's okay if you don't know how to talk about it.<eos> It's just that we've lost so much already.<eos> I don't wanna lose you, too.
Son...<eos> When all you see is your pain, you lose sight of Me.<eos> Stop talking in riddles.<eos> How can you say that you will help me when you couldn't help her?<eos> Because of you... she's gone.
You misunderstand the mystery.<eos> Don't ever think that what my son chose to do didn't cost us both dearly.<eos> Love always leaves a mark.<eos> We were there together.<eos> I never left him, I never left you.
Love is meant to exist within a relationship, Mack.<eos> That's all we wanna have with you.<eos> Even if you can't see it.<eos> You are in the center of our love and purpose.<eos> As beautiful as all this is, it's nothing compared to how we see you.
- I thought you said you'd never leave me.<eos> - And I meant it.<eos> Trust me.<eos> Don't forget what you've learned.<eos> I'll be waiting for you right here.
If that's what you believe...<eos> Come.<eos> Sit.<eos> You can judge me fine from there.<eos> - Judge you?
Papa's children from every tongue, tribe and nation.<eos> What you call personality and emotion, we see as color and light.<eos> What's happening with that one?<eos> Why is he focused on us?<eos> He's focused on you.
Oh, thank God.<eos> - We need to conserve our air.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Oh, it's almost over.<eos> I was so frightened, Kate, waiting for you.
Breathe in and out, like you told me, okay?<eos> In and out.<eos> - In and out.<eos> - So cold.<eos> Right, I'm gonna come and get you.
If we don't he's not gonna wake up tomorrow.<eos> None of us will.<eos> Baby, I'm sorry.<eos> - I love you.<eos> - I love you.
I'm... I'm Kevin, this is my wife, Julie.<eos> And I just want to say we're gonna be forever grateful for what you've done for us.<eos> What is your name?<eos> Listen, man, I want to help you.<eos> I want to save you and your family, okay?
Good for you.<eos> 'Cause the chase is the key.<eos> The chase.<eos> I got a wife, I'm settled in, but I don't have that... that drive, that sand.<eos> You, the love of your life left you.
Please stick around.<eos> So, Ray, uh, what'd you think?<eos> Of what?<eos> Of the poem.<eos> Well, your motorcycle tipped over on you.
Paper Hearts.<eos> What, are you working for Paper Hearts?<eos> - I can't say.<eos> - What can't you say?<eos> I... love... you.
We can get a drink in the bar.<eos> It's, you know, they have like a lounge thing.<eos> At least, you know, online.<eos> Love you.<eos> Love you, too.
I give them money sometimes, for, you know, whatever.<eos> And I don't have corporate sponsors or lobbyists or fund-raisers.<eos> And I'm... I'm not racist.<eos> I'm a warrior for the underclass, and I know how to ID an asshole in the making.<eos> I'm voting for you.
And people will forget about it. It will just blow over.<eos> Rick will not forget.<eos> He will come around.<eos> I won't forget.<eos> It's not about you.
-What the fuck are you talking about? -I have given your family everything, Stan.<eos> Everything. I've sobbed for days when you weren't around and Val was impossible.<eos> I slept on the floor by Beau's bed for nine months when he had those nightmares.<eos> I've nursed you every time that you were down.<eos> I did my best with Rick. I'm not their mother. And you weren't there to defend me but I fucking tried.

And you weren't there to defend me but I fucking tried.<eos> Because I love those kids.<eos> And I love you. So I didn't care.
Of course he does.<eos> Stan, listen to me.<eos> You will do more good as a governor than you ever will as a father or a husband.<eos> You're nothing without politics.<eos> You need me more than I need you.
You need me more than I need you.<eos> And those kids need a parent.<eos> And that's a stone-cold fact.<eos> We're talking about something here that is so extreme and so awful.<eos> What we're talking about is you're dead to the woman who is raising your children for you.
On the inside you're sick.<eos> I can smell it.<eos> Best night ever!<eos> Hey, driver.<eos> I love you. I love you.
- Of course.<eos> I wish you'd called me, Logan.<eos> Like I asked.<eos> See?<eos> You're not the only one that's been enhanced.
This is Laura.<eos> Caliban, come!<eos> This is who I've been telling you about.<eos> This is Laura.<eos> We've been waiting for you.
- What's going on?<eos> Where? - Stay here.<eos> - Don't move.<eos> - Where are we going?<eos> Hey, don't worry. He will be back for you.
But I want those teeth brushed.<eos> - Yeah, Dad.<eos> - All right.<eos> More?<eos> They're coming to get you, Barbara.
Wow.<eos> More for us.<eos> Stop it.<eos> You're acting like a child!<eos> They're coming for you.
Paul?<eos> Where the fuck did he go?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Paul, come on, dude.<eos> I'm not coming to get you.
- Ambition can be an evil thing, honey.<eos> He'd rather be a Hollywood playboy than a real father to you... - ...and we're hiding for a reason.<eos> - Not this again.<eos> I gotta go, Mom.<eos> He doesn't deserve to have you in his life.
Andy's father has no interest in him.<eos> He lives on movie sets with a girlfriend in every port.<eos> I can't imagine your ex really understood the agreement he made back when he made it.<eos> The agreement?<eos> He offered you.
And when I found out those sick people wanted you for their own I went to the doctor I should've seen in the first place, and I told him our crazy story and Andy, Andy, he believed me.<eos> And he gave us enough money to leave the city, and we've been running ever since.<eos> That doctor's kindness, that's proof of God, Andy.<eos> I had never learned to take care of myself until that day that day I found out they wanted you for their own.<eos> I had to choose my old life or you, and I chose you, Andy.

- Yeah, so it's a new machine.<eos> It's state of the art, though.<eos> All you gotta do is put in your order, and it does the rest.<eos> Coffee.<eos> You know, I'll just... I'll do it for you, and I think that's just gonna be the easiest.
- I am.<eos> Let's get you back to school.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Bye, Daddy. I love you.<eos> - I love you, too.
- Yeah.<eos> So, forget my statement 'cause I wasn't in the right...<eos> - It was chaotic. - It was chaotic.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And shame on you because we have been through an ordeal over all of this.
It's a bloodbath in there.<eos> Holly, Ms. Monet...<eos> We all got fired.<eos> No!<eos> You, too?
- Devji.<eos> - Sir?<eos> Tea time.<eos> "Your beauty, mesmerising."<eos> "The entire neighbourhood is crazy for you."
To heck with Sadiq!<eos> Sadiq, did you hear...?<eos> Look at me.<eos> What did you say?<eos> 'I did this for you, I did that for you'.
And hey, you're late on your chapter.<eos> Get back to work, woman.<eos> Bye-bye!<eos> It's a beautiful dress.<eos> Beautiful on you.
Tessa, why are you here?<eos> At our house?<eos> David's jury summons came to me.<eos> He did live there for years.<eos> It's not always all about you, Julia.
- Yes!<eos> It's intimidating.<eos> This glamorous life in the city.<eos> You're an editor and gorgeous and talented and effortlessly beautiful.<eos> That's very lovely of you to say, and I was terrified to meet you.
Why can't you see that?<eos> (SIGHS)<eos> I left her.<eos> I left her, okay?<eos> And I am sitting here, across from you, and I wanna marry you and I really don't wanna spend the rest of my life playing "she said, she said." Julia, lam tired of all of this.
Now what's wrong?<eos> Not sure, I just...<eos> By the pricking of my thumbs.<eos> Seriously?<eos> You?
Go on.<eos> One of them, Ajay, is looking for Mary, also one of the team. Indeed?<eos> Well, that's news to me.<eos> He's already killed looking for that memory stick.<eos> AGRA always worked for the highest bidder, I thought that might include you? Me?
Mary, I may not be a very good man... ..but I think I'm a bit better than you give me credit for, most of the time.<eos> All the time.<eos> You're always a good man, John, I've never doubted that.<eos> You never judge, you never complain.<eos> I don't deserve you, I...
I thought I was the only one who got out.<eos> How did you find us?<eos> By following you, Sherlock Holmes.<eos> I mean, you're clever.<eos> You found her but I found you. So perhaps not so clever.
Waiting for Mya.<eos> Long ago, the Krell crystal created a world for our people.<eos> The crystal's origin was unknown, lost in time.<eos> When destruction from the stars was foretold Lord God Garen bid me to bring the Krell to this world so he could prepare a new home for our people.<eos> But I failed, so I have selected you to fulfill my destiny.
Oh, for goodness' sakes!<eos> What's the matter with you?<eos> ! Are you having an earthquake?<eos> You need to see him, John, you need to help him!<eos> - No. - He needs you!
- A little bit funny.<eos> - If you keep taking what you're taking at the rate you're taking it, you've got weeks. Exactly, weeks!<eos> Let's not get ahead of ourselves.<eos> For Christ's sake, Sherlock, it's not a game!<eos> I'm worried about you, Molly, you seem very stressed.
Oh, has that door locked itself again?<eos> Yeah, it's always doing that.<eos> 'You can't save John, because he won't let you.<eos> He won't allow himself to be saved.<eos> The only way to save John is to make him save you.'
You know.<eos> Impossible.<eos> Nothing's impossible.<eos> You of all people know that.<eos> It's coming to get you.
Nothing's impossible.<eos> You of all people know that.<eos> It's coming to get you.<eos> There's an east wind coming, Mycroft.<eos> Coming to get you.
No, not Bach.<eos> You clearly don't understand it.<eos> Play you.<eos> - Me?<eos> - You.
- Why?<eos> - Do it.<eos> Step closer.<eos> Tell me what you remember.<eos> You, me and Mycroft.
No!<eos> No, no, no.<eos> They're gone.<eos> I failed.<eos> I would've gotten to my parents if I didn't have to go back for you!
Hey there, rat!<eos> How's it going, you blue idiot?<eos> Not so bad.<eos> We got ourselves a pretty good little gig here.<eos> This golden gal with quite a high opinion of herself... has offered us a large sum to deliver you and your pals over to her... because she wants to kill y'all.
You are not friends.<eos> You're right.<eos> We're family.<eos> We leave no one behind.<eos> Except maybe you.
He's coming.<eos> Didn't you say you could make him sleep?<eos> When he wants. He's too powerful.<eos> I can't!<eos> You don't have to believe in yourself... because I believe in you.
But why.<eos> Is that normal?<eos> - I believe the term is 'euphoria'.<eos> Sorry about the quarantine.<eos> It's to protect you from us, not us from you.
I didn't get to choose where I was born... but I get to choose where I die.<eos> - Tulsa.<eos> - Yes, Gardner?<eos> What's your favourite thing about earth?<eos> You are, Gardner.
- No, Tulsa, don't...<eos> I hate it.<eos> Look Gardner, we both know.. You have to go back.<eos> I love you, Tulsa.<eos> And I love you.
Just saying.<eos> He touches everything.<eos> It's up to you, Bear.<eos> I can't afford it without him.<eos> I know you can, but I don't... Elliot.
Enjoy it. I don't want that.<eos> I want what you have.<eos> An amazing wife, an amazing daughter.<eos> Well, just don't rush it.<eos> That's all out there waiting for you.
I know your parents died in a crash.<eos> Dude... He didn't tell me. They did.<eos> Bro, I didn't say anything.<eos> I would never tell anyone that.<eos> They're worried about you, though.
You're worse than Sonny Jim.<eos> Dougie, you've lost weight!<eos> Let me cinch this up.<eos> And this jacket looks two sizes too big.<eos> That black suit last night fit you perfectly.
He's looking for work.<eos> He will find a job.<eos> - Honey, I can give you this. - Okay. - But this is all I got.<eos> - Thanks. I love you.<eos> I love you, too, Becky.
Case files.<eos> Case files.<eos> And this one... there's nothing written on it.<eos> Okay, Dougie, you need to go upstairs and say good night to Sonny Jim.<eos> He's been waiting up for you.
Case files.<eos> And this one... there's nothing written on it.<eos> Okay, Dougie, you need to go upstairs and say good night to Sonny Jim.<eos> He's been waiting up for you.<eos> Up for you.
Watch right here.<eos> Bobby, when your father told me this, you were a very long way from where you are today.<eos> Somehow, he knew that it would all turn out well.<eos> He saw this life for you.<eos> Your father never lost faith in you.
Citizens of Gotham, we need all of you to join us and help bring this city back together.<eos> I'm just gonna come right out and say it.<eos> I hate you, Joker.<eos> - I hate you, too. - I hate you more.<eos> I hate you the most.
I'm just gonna come right out and say it.<eos> I hate you, Joker.<eos> - I hate you, too. - I hate you more.<eos> I hate you the most.<eos> I hate you forever.
It kept me going under very difficult circumstances.<eos> but... - Yeah. It's all I got.<eos> it doesn't sound ridiculous.<eos> I was 13 when Dad died.<eos> And I still hadn't quite gotten over you and your family.
You know the rules about cell phones in my dojo.<eos> Line up.<eos> Make seiza.<eos> Darryl.<eos> but they never get to see you go all out.
Danny...<eos> I still do not understand what that even means.<eos> It's a... It's a unique force... used to protect K'un-Lun.<eos> It's passed down from generation to generation... and it's given to one student from the monastery to wield.<eos> Why were you chosen to get it?
Oh, the one without the tongue is Vando.<eos> The other guy, I didn't get his name.<eos> The Hand sent them over to deliver a message.<eos> - We have to call somebody.<eos> - Yeah, I did. I called you.
I'm sorry.<eos> Afterwards, my dad sent me to live with my grandfather in Japan, but... I always felt kinda...<eos> I don't know.<eos> Abandoned.<eos> It doesn't matter how much anyone else cares for you.
I suspect our guests may be from a bit further away.<eos> Go and find out.<eos> Find Claire.<eos> I'm gonna go after Gao.<eos> She's expecting you.
What are you doing?<eos> Come on.<eos> No. Not till you explain this.<eos> The truth is... I'm having financial trouble.<eos> I brought you here to ask you for money, but you're making me feel like an asshole, so forget about it.
Ignore her.<eos> Claire?<eos> Yep.<eos> Danny Rand.<eos> Your friends are going to die because of you.
Hmm, no.<eos> But it's the safest place I know.<eos> How do you feel?<eos> I'm tired.<eos> I was so worried about you.
Did you talk to her?<eos> Manipulating as always.<eos> Working an angle.<eos> Trying to get me to question everything.<eos> Even you.
If I'm supposed to be the destroyer of the Hand, then I should be here, destroying them where they are.<eos> You're a warrior, like me.<eos> Trained to be the Iron Fist.<eos> But I'm not the Iron Fist.<eos> I wasn't chosen. You were.
- Bakuto, what the hell is this?<eos> You were supposed to tell me when you found Danny.<eos> I blame myself for this.<eos> Bakuto, I believe in the Hand!<eos> But I don't know... if I believe in you.
You weren't really gonna have Dad killed, right?<eos> You poor people are such a mess.<eos> I know a good family therapist that could help, should any of you survive the night.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> I'm gonna come back for you, Bakuto.
K'un-Lun would have been better off if Chodak and Tashi had never found you.<eos> You'd choose this putrid hellhole over the people who raised you?<eos> Get up!<eos> This has nothing to do with K'un-Lun.<eos> This is because I left you.
Just one of those things.<eos> and I think that's my greatest regret. That I didn't kill Wendell then... before you were even born.<eos> you destroyed my family!<eos> Harold!<eos> The funny part is that now I'm gonna kill you.
A light... for those trapped in the darkness.<eos> There's a lot of darkness right here in New York.<eos> Yeah.<eos> too.<eos> I'll miss you... while you're gone.
You said you only wanted to fulfill your dad's wish and nothing else?<eos> You archaeologists, don't you want an item from the past to see the light again, so people can treasure and preserve it?<eos> The present buyer will surely treasure it because he paid a huge price for it.<eos> Stop finding excuses.<eos> If we don't bring the diamond back, because of you, professor will have to take the blame for stealing cultural relics.
Open the cases.<eos> Take it easy!<eos> Guys... Hey, guys.<eos> Can you help me down?<eos> Let me figure it out. We'll come back to you.
- Mr. Murdock...<eos> - Mr. Murdock, sir...<eos> Yes...<eos> You abandoned them.<eos> Because of you, the Hand has won.
Jessica Jones, do yourself a favor and don't look for John Raymond.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hey, stranger.<eos> Should we get that coffee?<eos> Waiting on you was a heck of a gamble.
- Thanks.<eos> Sorry to interrupt.<eos> But I'm glad to see you're settling in.<eos> Hey, Misty. It's good to see you.<eos> Good to see you, too, Luke.
He might not have died if I hadn't left my post in K'un-Lun.<eos> - I know that you are angry...<eos> - This isn't about anger.<eos> It's about fault.<eos> All I'm saying is you're not the only person the Hand has ever hurt.
It's all right.<eos> Stand down.<eos> This is your home now.<eos> We are your family.<eos> I have waited so long to meet you.
"Together, we serve life itself."<eos> "Together, we serve life itself."<eos> Black Sky.<eos> Perhaps you'd be more effective on the battlefield if you killed your enemies, rather than letting them escape.<eos> Alexandra insisted we use the last of our resources on you.
Determined.<eos> Mr. Rand, I'm sorry your exit from our meeting was so abrupt.<eos> You tried to kill us.<eos> Oh, them maybe.<eos> Not you.
Yeah.<eos> I wouldn't be here if it wasn't important.<eos> I'm gonna need a little more than that.<eos> It's the Hand.<eos> They came for you before, Karen.
I believe you have.<eos> You made a unilateral decision and used the last of the substance to resurrect her.<eos> And now, we are all vulnerable.<eos> Actually, I have never felt better than with her at my side.<eos> Except, it's not about you.
It's simple.<eos> My dad abandoned us and got himself killed.<eos> - I know it's probably hard to understand...<eos> - Actually, it's not.<eos> Your dad didn't wanna hurt you or your mom.
- There is no plan.<eos> - I can tell.<eos> - Look, Luke, I am your friend.<eos> - I know, Misty.<eos> That's why I'm trying to protect you. Let me.
But you're not gonna like it.<eos> Don't shoot.<eos> Look, I don't give a shit what you guys are doing... down here in your secret cave thing.<eos> I just came to talk.<eos> You started this.
- We have to have our privacy.<eos> And we're worried you don't realize what you've gotten yourself into.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I didn't mean to hurt you.<eos> - It's not you.
- Hey, it's me.<eos> Mae? How are you holding up?<eos> Better, actually. I'm coming in to see them today, but I need your help.<eos> Yeah, sure, name it.<eos> We were worried when we didn't hear from you for so long.
How am I gonna convince her I'm gay?<eos> Just go with me here.<eos> Brian's not above having a one-night stand with a woman, but he's got no room for her emotionally<eos> - because he's in love with me.<eos> - With you?
- I do.<eos> Five grand is a lot of money...<eos> is that offer just out on the table?<eos> - I'm not gonna bang you.<eos> - I don't want to bang you, either, Frank,
Well, you know what, Frank, I'll figure it out, okay?<eos> Because I don't want my kid to grow up like I did.<eos> With some asshole dad who was never even around.<eos> You talking about me or Bruce?<eos> You!
She's in Rome, for her coronation.<eos> You will take the catacombs in...<eos> It doesn't matter where she is.<eos> That's why I need the ghost, lo spettro John Wick.<eos> That's why I need you.
- Why the hell not?<eos> I told you I needed 24 hours, i wanted to talk to you first.<eos> - What for?<eos> - Because we're a team.<eos> Listen, her offer's only good if I discredit the program, the guys and you.
No, we aren't gonna touch the gifts, right?<eos> Okay, we don't touch them.<eos> We just, we look at them.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - And they look back at you and they...
Let me just...<eos> You want to sleep.<eos> Well, I'll sleep you. Hmm.<eos> Well, what-what is that?<eos> Well, I don't know, you made me think of, like, sitcoms,
- Yeah, this one we can't do in-house.<eos> - We can't... we can't...<eos> That's why I wanted to bring in a third party.<eos> Someone to hear us out and deliver a final verdict.<eos> - That's you, guy.
- We can't... we can't...<eos> That's why I wanted to bring in a third party.<eos> Someone to hear us out and deliver a final verdict.<eos> - That's you, guy.<eos> - Yeah, that's... you.
That's why I wanted to bring in a third party.<eos> Someone to hear us out and deliver a final verdict.<eos> - That's you, guy.<eos> - Yeah, that's... you.<eos> That's you.
Y-You've hired an arbitration attorney to figure out which of you is entitled to a two-dollar scratcher?<eos> - Now you're getting it. - Me.<eos> - He's getting it.<eos> - Now he gets it.<eos> The thing is, each one of us feels that we're entitled to that ticket, and we need you
- He peeps on women.<eos> - That's his move.<eos> He's disgusting.<eos> Like I said, bird watching.<eos> Not you.
Two shots of whiskey.<eos> Okay, yes, nice.<eos> Finally, somebody's actually working.<eos> You know what, I appreciate that, Dee.<eos> - I appreciate you.
Dinner's on me tonight, okay? Mmm.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Anastasia.<eos> It was you, wasn't it? You just went and bought all of these?<eos> I don't like strangers gawking at you.
What do you call it?<eos> A vanilla relationship?<eos> I mean, we only do what you're comfortable with.<eos> But you need all those things.<eos> I need you more.
I'm gonna need a road map.<eos> I thought you wanted to take it slow.<eos> What do you want, Anastasia?<eos> If we're to communicate, you have to tell me.<eos> I want you.
Why do you think you waited?<eos> For sex.<eos> I was reading Austen and bronté and nobody ever measured up to that.<eos> I guess I was waiting for something exceptional.<eos> And then I met you.
Come on.<eos> The way you wear your hat the way you sip your tea<eos> the memory of all that no, no, they can't take that away from me the way your smile just beams<eos> the way you sing off-key everybody's looking at us.<eos> Not us. You.
Thank you.<eos> Do you still have that gift I gave you?<eos> Yes.<eos> You know you didn't have to.<eos> All I want is you.
Are you sure?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> I love you.<eos> Well, I love you.
I'm sorry, what?<eos> You think that just anybody can get into Miss Rita's ballet company?<eos> -Oh, so it's "Miss Rita's ballet company".<eos> -Precisely.<eos> Who made dancers out of you?
We've gone over them a hundred times!<eos> God! Damn it!<eos> Can I just get five minutes of my own life?<eos> Nothing that happened today was your fault.<eos> I got mad at you... I was really mad at me.
So, Mary... I see you're looking at our little problem.<eos> Little? It's big.<eos> Why are you so mad all of the sudden?<eos> I'm not mad, I'm annoyed.<eos> Not with you, darlin'. With that pompes ass, Shankland.
What if I didn't use a sword?<eos> Fighting does not make you a hero.<eos> Just the shield then, no sharp edges.<eos> Diana, you are the most precious thing in the world to me.<eos> I wished for you so much, so I sculpted you from clay myself. And begged Zeus to give you life.
This belonged to the greatest warrior in our history... our beloved Anti­ope.<eos> Make sure you're worthy of it.<eos> I will.<eos> Be careful in the world of men, Diana.<eos> They do not deserve you.
Do you think I have had a neat food or rest, captain?<eos> Do you hear me making excuses?<eos> No.<eos> Your men, they are weak, complacent.<eos> You've let them forget for an attack can happen at any time. From any cover!
We have run out of time.<eos> As soon as the Kaiser sees the newest weapon... he will not sign the armistice.<eos> But without my notebook...<eos> We will get your book!<eos> It is you that I believe in, not it.
- No!<eos> - Get away from me!<eos> I understand everything now.<eos> It isn't just the Germans that Ares has corrupted.<eos> It's you too.
Five minutes, no more.<eos> We're on borrowed time.<eos> There's no way out, Ahmadi.<eos> What the hell's he doing?<eos> You have all those itchy trigger fingers out there waiting for you.
Jake.<eos> How you doing, Jake?<eos> I'm fine, thanks.<eos> If it's okay with you guys, I'd like to get straight to the point,<eos> I don't wanna keep you waiting any longer.
Back room for moving the cocaine.<eos> Nah, I'm not with it.<eos> A DJ booth.<eos> Do I have your attention now?<eos> You are a so-called DJ, right?
- We'll get you an autograph, Mylene.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Over here! - Mylene, look.<eos> I know, I know, I know it's hard not to go with your friends.<eos> But you have a higher calling.
♪ 'Cause if you came here to get it on ♪<eos> ♪ You know you got to cross your Rubicon Say, we all came here... ♪<eos> What did you just say to me?<eos> You disgust me.<eos> I can't even stand the sight of you!
You gotta join with the universe and just be.<eos> Be careful on your surfboard.<eos> It's windy in the galaxy tonight.<eos> I love you, Boo.<eos> Love you too, Dizz.
He has an army of Zulu warriors.<eos> They fucking up gangsters and dealers. Believe me, I seen it with my own eyes.<eos> And maybe if we show we're down with peace and love and unity, maybe Bambaataa and the warriors can defend us from Annie.<eos> Man, you owned that shit tonight, Mylene.<eos> And that Saturday Night Fever guy, he really gonna put you and "Toy Box" in his fucking movie.
Get a break.<eos> Luke?<eos> I appreciate that.<eos> - It's good to see you, Nobody.<eos> - You too.
Meet you at the pick-up.<eos> I think I know where my team's at.<eos> - Where?<eos> - Right in front of me.<eos> This is on you.
They will walk you along a tightrope. A line between life and death.<eos> I will give you all the information that you request. In return, I will need a single meeting with Sir Stuart Strange.<eos> If your witness is Delaney, he is being held in the Tower of London, charged with treason.<eos> No, I have another witness.<eos> When my ship is ready, I will send for you.
If they don't sing, then how do I hear them?<eos> That is a question to be asked and answered in America.<eos> Is it not?<eos> Tide's rising.<eos> You've lots of people waiting for you, people who have given up everything for you, James.
If my factory is discovered... I will know where to find you.<eos> You stink of cow shit. It's horse shit, actually.<eos> We thought you might have left for good.<eos> And would that be good?<eos> I visited your sister to ask where you were.
And would that be good?<eos> I visited your sister to ask where you were.<eos> Three days and not a word?<eos> Did you think it would go unnoticed?<eos> The Company have men in every tavern asking where you are.
There will be a man with markings on his face to meet you... he will take you to my friend Atticus.<eos> Tell my friend Atticus where Helga is.<eos> Write your account... he will secure it and keep you safe.<eos> Safe? Safe?<eos> When my ship is ready, I will send for you.
Every kid should have a gym set.<eos> There you go, brother. Yeah.<eos> A toast.<eos> Oh... dougie.<eos> Here's to you, dougie.
That's why I am fucking Billy.<eos> Audrey. I saw Billy in my dream last night, and he was bleeding from the nose and mouth.<eos> And dreams sometimes hearken a truth.<eos> Now, I got to go, Charlie.<eos> I asked for your company, your protection, but you're such a milquetoast, the only protection would be me protecting you.
Where do I get it?<eos> By paying me top fucking dollar, cowboy.<eos> Why are you so against me?<eos> 'Cause you're a weak fucking coward.<eos> It makes me sick just to look at you.
That sounds so good.<eos> Okay. Okay, I'll be right there.<eos> Okay, hurry up, and we'll find some time to talk, okay?<eos> Okay, thanks. I love you.<eos> I love you, too.
Hey, you.<eos> Hey, girl.<eos> You two talk business. We'll move somewhere else.<eos> Good to see you, Walter. Oh, yeah.<eos> Good to see you, too.
Many happy returns.<eos> Wow. Thank you, Freddie. That's a great story.<eos> The pleasure's all mine, sir.<eos> Why you?<eos> I mean, why do you think the Fireman picked you?
It's a free cunt-ry.<eos> Maybe you're one of them bull dykes.<eos> Come to think of it, you look kind of like a bull dyke lesbo.<eos> You like to eat cunt, huh?<eos> I'll eat you. What?
I thought that we were supposed to go through these things together...<eos> Yeah, I was scared.<eos> I-I thought that maybe this was something that you couldn't get past.<eos> Wow, if you think so little of me why do you still wanna marry me?<eos> It wasn't about you, it was about me.
I think what I need is sleep.<eos> We're gonna be okay.<eos> I just wish that you had as much faith in me as I have in you.<eos> - I love you.<eos> - I love you too.
And you make me a better woman because you searched for one.<eos> Do you promise... to do that everyday for the rest of our lives?<eos> Yes.<eos> - I love you.<eos> - I love you too.
- I can't tell.<eos> It's either a really bad comedy about chefs or a really good infomercial about deep fryers.<eos> Can we talk?<eos> I don't know what else to say, Hanna.<eos> The decisions you make don't just affect you.
You can deal with Mona until then, right?<eos> Sure.<eos> How much damage can she do in one night?<eos> - I love you.<eos> - I love you too.
I didn't even know about Mary Drake.<eos> At first, I thought Wren was putting me on.<eos> But then he pulled out his phone showed me your picture.<eos> I still don't know why, but I started to cry.<eos> He just ran into you?
There is nothing more that I would love than to hold you, Spencer but she would never forgive me if you got out.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - You don't have to thank me.<eos> I'm your mother.<eos> Aria, this isn't about you.
Yes, it is, dad.<eos> We got into an argument last night.<eos> I let him down.<eos> No.<eos> He let you down.
Enchante, mademoiselle.<eos> Au revoir.<eos> - Is she here?<eos> - Yeah, her plane just landed.<eos> She's waiting for you in the bar.
Why is everybody crying?<eos> I don't know.<eos> For some reason, this feels like it's the end of something.<eos> I love you, guys.<eos> We love you too.
Does that make any sense?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Are you following this?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And, like, I look at you, and you're so beautiful.
Well, speaking as the consolation prize, we're gonna have a pretty big fight - about what you just said. - No, no, no.<eos> But not tonight. Not tonight.<eos> I did not mean it like that.<eos> You are the greatest thing that ever happened to me, and don't you for one minute think anything else.<eos> It's just entirely possible for me to love you with all my heart and still feel... Hurt over your ex.
Come on, I know you. I know you better than anyone.<eos> You can't have other people in your life, especially women.<eos> You're just making my job harder.<eos> Your job?<eos> Protecting you.
Me neither!<eos> You're happy to see me, right?<eos> No.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Nothing! I wanted to see you and my niece.
- Really? - Really.<eos> But, hey, why don't you go knock on their doors.<eos> Maybe they'll take you in.<eos> I love you!<eos> - I love you mom.
All of it. I gave myself a little makeover.<eos> Maybe next time, they can makeover your brain.<eos> I know perfectly well... I look very good.<eos> I love you, stupid face.<eos> I love you too, little sister.
So you were using me to get Arden's grand mother.<eos> No, no, no, I was helping you. - Please don't lie.<eos> - I swear...<eos> Okay... a little bit. I mean, I sort of used you.<eos> But, it wasn't really about you.
You helped me make my dream come true.<eos> You earned it.<eos> You're so talented.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you.
Nathan, come on.<eos> It was pretty tough when you left.<eos> But that was 15 years ago.<eos> Okay, it's difficult for Madeline to see you at every school function so involved when you weren't there for Abigail.<eos> It's difficult to run into you at yoga when you never...
He has something.<eos> Stiles, is this you?<eos> Alright, just remember this<eos> - Canaan.<eos> We're comin' to get you.
You have to find Scott.<eos> I'm not leaving you.<eos> You have to.<eos> You can save me on the other side.<eos> I believe in you.
This is a mistake.<eos> You took a risk.<eos> We took a risk.<eos> But it was the right thing to do.<eos> I believe in you.
How did you know?<eos> There's a refraction of light around your silhouette that I can always see.<eos> I don't know, it probably has something to do with pheromones or some other chemical interaction.<eos> It's my only power.<eos> Finding you.
You have to keep your eyes open.<eos> Trying...<eos> It's not sleep.<eos> I think you're losing consciousness.<eos> And if you do that, I think we're gonna lose you.
Look at him. We...<eos> We need to do something.<eos> Not yet...<eos> You have to try to save everyone.<eos> How do we save you?
There are too many of us and too few of you.<eos> Even from the Hunt, you somehow wormed your way back into his memory.<eos> Yeah, worming is one of my skills.<eos> That thing is conjured from your dad's pain.<eos> If he remembers you, he can't believe in her.
My name is Alice Vaughan.<eos> - You're a cop?<eos> - Private investigator.<eos> I run a P.I. and security firm along with my partner, Val.<eos> Yo! You need to get in here and pick out a wedding cake, or I'm gonna pick one out for you, and it'll be carrot.
It's about your life.<eos> Whoever killed the Kincaids, the minute they find out the money's in your name, they're gonna come after you.<eos> But this money could change everything for me.<eos> I-I mean, I could go somewhere, disappear, and... and you wouldn't have to worry about me ever again.<eos> I would be worried about you every minute for the rest of my life.
Babe! Babe! It's late!<eos> Don't leave.<eos> You're gonna wake up your brother, and, you know,<eos> I wouldn't want to corrupt him any more than I already have.<eos> It's not you, it's him.
You're gonna wake up your brother, and, you know,<eos> I wouldn't want to corrupt him any more than I already have.<eos> It's not you, it's him.<eos> He is a 35-year-old man who has never had a job.<eos> His life is a complete disaster, And I can't have him looking at you. And your life and thinking that that's an option,
Take that off right now.<eos> Benji, I thought you'd never ask.<eos> This is ridiculous.<eos> The only reason the fbi recruited us...<eos> Recruited you.
What a coincidence.<eos> We're looking for him, too.<eos> So we can't help you.<eos> Well...<eos> If I don't find him, at least I know where I can find you... and your friends.
Yeah, I know what a consul general does, thank you very much.<eos> Then you know she's super well-connected.<eos> She has total access.<eos> She knows everyone.<eos> Including you, apparently.
What the hell was that?<eos> You should have seen your face.<eos> Well, thanks to me, he can.<eos> You hacked the system.<eos> I couldn't count on you to do it.
'Cause we will.<eos> No. Then we go to Ev.<eos> We find more medicine.<eos> Whatever happened, we'll fix it.<eos> We'll turn you back to you.
This man here has a grievance.<eos> You've lost someone. Her mother.<eos> My wife.<eos> We've all lost someone.<eos> Because of you.
Go to hell.<eos> How did you get those?<eos> Those were hers.<eos> My sister's.<eos> So, August, can I count on you to build my arsenal?
I may be the one wearing a mask, but I can see through yours just as clearly.<eos> What is it that you want?<eos> Whatever it is, it's yours.<eos> I want to see Emerald City laid to waste.<eos> And I want to see you drown in its suffering!
Liar!<eos> She's lying!<eos> Did you... help the girl out of spite?<eos> Hmm? To hurt your mistress?<eos> As much as she hurt you?
Magic strong enough to kill a witch.<eos> What is it?<eos> A bullet more powerful than magic.<eos> Sylvie, did you do this?<eos> Can I count on you to build my arsenal?
But I am not gonna stand by and watch you suffer.<eos> Then go.<eos> Shall we let her?<eos> If this is what you want.<eos> Let's see what lowly witch has cast a spell on you.
You're afraid of what this is...<eos> Us, me... that we're all gonna leave you, just because your mother did.<eos> No.<eos> So you're not running away?<eos> Leaving us to lose you, just like Em and Henry?
- Then I can't help you.<eos> That woman needs help.<eos> Look, I know you're confused.<eos> I've been confused, too, ever since I came to oz.<eos> - But then I found you.
Of all of our sisters, you were the one destined to take her place.<eos> Did you know that?<eos> Did you know that she saw you as her heir?<eos> Not me, not east.<eos> You.
Did you know that she saw you as her heir?<eos> Not me, not east.<eos> You.<eos> Where is she?<eos> In a place safe from all those who would do her harm, including you.
Kill them all!<eos> Kill them!<eos> Sylvie, no. No.<eos> Now you see.<eos> Everyone is dying because of you.
Twins... as close as two things can get to being the same one, and what's the first thing they do to each other?<eos> Fight over who gets to be the first one to see the light of day.<eos> And here I sit at the head of an army of men, each of whom, present company included, has probably at some point considered killing the man he now fights alongside, each of whom, present company included, has certainly considered killing me.<eos> If it makes you feel any better,<eos> I haven't considered killing you in months.
I'm told that once mastered, it's actually quite soothing.<eos> At this moment, I'm finding that hard to believe.<eos> But if I am to play the role,<eos> I ought to make some effort to look the part.<eos> It bothers me that this does not bother you.
I will do whatever necessary to ensure your success here.<eos> If the street understands us better when I sit among your men's wives rather than your men, if the world makes more sense to them that way and your authority grows because of it, as uncomfortable as it may be,<eos> then that is a compromise I am willing to make.<eos> Governor?<eos> I'll send for you as soon as I'm satisfied the street is secure.
There were three ships, not two.<eos> He bought them cheap out of Abaco.<eos> He scuttled them six days ago.<eos> The moment I learned of it, I sent word to Mr. Featherstone.<eos> He was supposed to send word to you not to enter the harbor.
- We are two battered fighters at the end of a long fight.<eos> The next blow struck may be a decisive one, and we have to be the one that strikes.<eos> Stop.<eos> I prepared these men to follow Long John Silver upon his return.<eos> Now, if you assume that in his absence, that role now reverts to you... then you assume wrong.
Are you through?<eos> Yes.<eos> Then go.<eos> When was the last time you fought in a vanguard?<eos> He ain't never gonna see you in that way, Teach.
What did he do?<eos> Set a course for Nassau... to send a message when we return... that this can all end... if the governor turns over the one thing he wants.<eos> When I made the choice to see Charles' sentence carried out,<eos> I did not know what the consequences would be.<eos> I knew it was the only way to protect our future here, to protect you, so I did it.
Without you, life's not Worth a cent, Julia<eos> One.. two" three" four"<eos> Soaring like an eagle<eos> When she swoops, Julia<eos> She will strike you like the lightning
I'm no less than Julia, she's my junior.<eos> I don't care"<eos> I can't walk, I want a donkey right now!<eos> Of course, Queen Victoria.<eos> Why don't we ask King George to send you his private plane?
She isn't ready yet?<eos> Shall we cancel the show?<eos> Zulfi..<eos> The army is looking for him.<eos> They'll find him just as they found you.
You have the opium.<eos> This 'Akbari Afeem' isn't burning.<eos> What will I do?<eos> Smoke a joint with wild bears?<eos> On the contrary, they will fear you.
I wanted to tell you something important.<eos> Tell me.<eos> I'm embarrassed about what happened in the jungle.<eos> OK.<eos> And also a little mad at you.
When she swoops, Julia<eos> She will raise<eos> Quite a storm, Julia<eos> She will burst forth like gushing water<eos> She will strike you like the lightning
You have something going on intestinally and you're too proud to stop at a Walgreen's or a CVS to deal with it.<eos> Is it a chronic thing, or did you eat something dicey last night?<eos> Just drop it!<eos> Listen, okay...<eos> Don't pull away. I'm worried about you.
I think it's 350.<eos> You guys kinda caught me in the middle of it.<eos> Why don't you come back in an hour and a half or so, when I'm gone?<eos> No, right now is good.<eos> We'll just shadow you.
- That's standard?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> Wow, things have changed!<eos> - Hey, it was great meeting you.<eos> - Hey, you too.
- What if I did?<eos> - Then they'd kill you.<eos> You know too much now to be allowed to stay uncommitted.<eos> I'm going to give you a lesson you will never forget.<eos> I'm worried about you, Doug.
- Whoever did this...<eos> - No, it's you, Doug.<eos> You did this.<eos> Right.<eos> Cos I should have stuck with you.
Don't stay here, Sylvia.<eos> Leave the controlled zone...<eos> go to the Lakes.<eos> You sound like Harry.<eos> He's worried about you.
Dunn was looking for leads on Frick.<eos> It seems the Professor's been written out of history.<eos> But why use the mail?<eos> Jimmy must have seen that he was being followed... wanted to make sure this didn't fall into the wrong hands.<eos> A caution, no doubt, instilled by you.
I wonder what he's got planned for me.<eos> Well, maybe you shouldn't go.<eos> An antique dealer might know something about the Shepherd Market murder.<eos> Or maybe he thinks you're in with the Germans, just like he is.<eos> I'm worried about you, Doug.
So we know where everyone goes.<eos> Are you still with the girl?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Stay there.<eos> I'm sending someone to bring you to me.
I'm going to try and get you out.<eos> I'll talk to Kellermann.<eos> What, just me?<eos> What about Sylvia?<eos> For Christ's sake, Doug, don't blame her for the attack on you.
So where's Harry now?<eos> The SS secret police have asked the Army for him.<eos> They say because he's a police officer that the Army have no right to hold him.<eos> I have to get to Gestapo Headquarters immediately.<eos> That might make them take an extra interest in Harry - and you.
I'm okay, Mom.<eos> We'll be fine.<eos> Scoot over.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you more.
I'm just trying to help out a friend.<eos> What's the big problem?<eos> Why is it such a big deal for you?<eos> It's not.<eos> I'm just looking out for you, Sparkles.
- It's not gonna go to court.<eos> That is a done deal. It's amazing.<eos> You have nothing to worry about.<eos> You're so good to me.<eos> I believe in you.
Can you tell me a little bit more about what happened?<eos> My niece and she knew each other through the church music program.<eos> But she was the most gifted.<eos> People used to kid her, "You're too good for this place.<eos> "We're gonna wake up one day and you'll be gone, and that'll be that."
You shouldn't be her doctor, too. Excuse me.<eos> Is she sick?<eos> Did something happen?<eos> She went outside because of him.<eos> Because of you!
It's not true.<eos> It is.<eos> What kind of future could you have with me?<eos> I'm trying to protect you.<eos> Protect me? I don't want protection. I want you.
A surprise party?<eos> Which you know nothing about.<eos> Not a thing.<eos> I love you, puppy.<eos> I love you, too.
Not a thing.<eos> I love you, puppy.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> I love you, puppy.<eos> I love you, too, baby.
Do they say it in worship?<eos> Oh, they mouth your name, hmm, but they have no idea what it means. None whatsoever.<eos> Same every spring.<eos> You do all the work, he gets all the prayers.<eos> What has gotten into you?
I feel terrible about this.<eos> No.<eos> No! It's her day. You took it.<eos> You crucified her day.<eos> When they started following you, everybody else got burned. In your name.
Thank you.<eos> Track him.<eos> Turn around.<eos> I'm having another violent dream, Doctor.<eos> Brinn's been worried sick about you.
Oh, where are my manners? Logan.<eos> Logan King.<eos> Chris was just telling me how he felt much more comfortable with my being here.<eos> That's nice.<eos> Logan, I hate to tear you away, dear, but the Wincotts were asking about you.
No, no, no. We're just very happy that you're yourself again.<eos> Yes. Yes, I am. Hmm.<eos> And I thank God for you for calming me down.<eos> I know that I must've frightened you all quite a bit.<eos> Especially you, Chris. No.
For phase three.<eos> The transplantation. Well, partial, actually.<eos> The piece of your brain connected to your nervous system needs to stay put, keeping those intricate connections intact.<eos> So you won't be gone, not completely.<eos> A sliver of you will still be in there, somewhere, limited consciousness.
Your first bed as a free man.<eos> Enjoy it.<eos> Shadow?<eos> About that little shit in the big limo.<eos> An assault on you is an insult to me.
I heard about the trouble you had with the Technical Boy.<eos> I was impressed with how you dealt with him.<eos> Efficient, no-nonsense, effective.<eos> Who'd have thought you had it in you?<eos> He was underestimating you, sweetheart. They all are.
In these moments, you gotta ask yourself:<eos> Would I rather be ignored? Yes.<eos> Okay, yes, ignore me.<eos> Always better dead than forgotten.<eos> And no one is ever gonna forget you.
You brought that madness into my life once.<eos> - Never again.<eos> - They'll all be there.<eos> Everyone except you-- ...each of them thinking they know what strong is.<eos> And if you're not there to show them otherwise...
Maybe he won't get it.<eos> We both know if Jordan wants it, he'll get it.<eos> Rainer, can you guys please just get over this?<eos> I feel like I'm reliving my parents' divorce.<eos> You didn't hear it from me but it's down to you and Dakota for August.
He is the best guy friend I've ever had and I'm not gonna screw that up.<eos> You're already screwing' it up.<eos> By not screwing him, because you know it's gonna happen.<eos> You're gonna wait too long, he'll meet someone else and how are you gonna feel then?<eos> Look, you're into him and I'm pretty sure he's into you too.
Um, you didn't, uh, get a call about the movie, did you?<eos> Those losers wouldn't recognize talent if it sat on their faces.<eos> - See you later.<eos> - Love you.<eos> 'Love you more.'
Because I've been there.<eos> You lied to me.<eos> 'You don't have to do this.'<eos> 'Yes, I do.'<eos> 'Oh, when I'm gone, I'll spend every moment I can' 'remembering you.'
Nice, right?<eos> Natural.<eos> Hey. It's on me.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Watching you and Alvey today.
Oh. Thank you.<eos> This is really helpful.<eos> No problem.<eos> So, how's Mac?<eos> Is he taking care of you?
Sugar and poison.<eos> There are the fundamental building blocks of a healthy relationship.<eos> You can try it on Will.<eos> You can call me and say thank you.<eos> She's trying with you.
Thanks.<eos> - I'll see you in class. - Yeah.<eos> Sure.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Do you know how worried everyone is about you?
I am a year behind.<eos> Everyone on my track is ahead of me.<eos> Mingo has moved on and I can't find a place to live on campus!<eos> Daphne, you have got to calm down. - Okay?<eos> - I'm not blaming you.
Oh, without Eddie?<eos> Karolina, he's my brother.<eos> You wanted to know where Eddie is. Now you know.<eos> If you'll excuse me, I need to relax.<eos> I also wanted to see you.
I love Amanda.<eos> I love supporting her dreams.<eos> Yeah. And you love coffee.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> And I love you.
The house is still very quiet.<eos> We'll see what the doctor has to say about that.<eos> I'm not dead yet, for Christ's sakes.<eos> This is going to be a really sad last run if Dr. Geffen says that's off the table.<eos> It's not all about you, Otto.
I didn't perjure myself. I didn't testify.<eos> Taylor put a man in custody wanted in New York for murder, and he doesn't know.<eos> When this comes out, it could ruin him.<eos> I did it for Taylor.<eos> And you and Grandpa and Carly.
Because some girls think, you know,<eos> "I'm gonna work for a year or two and make some money and put it aside and then I'll do something else."<eos> And I'm like, "Yeah, you're not doing something else."<eos> You're gonna have at any other job, someone's gonna know what you've done."<eos> You have to be done with the business before the business is done with you.
I said, "I'm in theater, I'm doing legitimate theater."<eos> I'm not no porno star."<eos> They go, "Yes, you are."<eos> I go, "What are you talking about?"<eos> They go, "We got a $50,000 check waiting for you", "and you gotta go to Cannes Film Festival because they're dying to meet you."
Like what? What did I do?<eos> Is it you and Alex now? No!<eos> How could you even...<eos> Of course not!<eos> He likes you, you like him.
You gonna talk to her?<eos> And say what?<eos> Tell her to get her shit together.<eos> She's acting like a nut job, drawing attention to herself.<eos> And you.
Sweetie, your friends are not going to like or dislike you for a car.<eos> Mom, it's high school.<eos> Of course they will.<eos> Listen, I was in high school.<eos> Yeah, but you have no idea, because you were popular, I'm not.
She's nice.<eos> So you only like nice girls?<eos> That's not what I said.<eos> I just thought you were cooler than... a Sheri.<eos> I waited for you, Marcus.
That's good.<eos> I just got off the phone with the counselor.<eos> He said that other boy got suspended for three days.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> But you weren't disciplined at all.
Guys, leave Zach alone.<eos> He's just desperate to lose it before his dad has to buy him a hooker.<eos> You get back here, young man!<eos> Zachy! Poor Zach!<eos> You said something stupid, Zach... and I yelled at you.
Well, I can tell you that our financial aid tends to go to students at the top of their class, with SATs above the 90th percentile.<eos> Great.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Of course.<eos> And if you don't have the money and don't really have the grades, a lot of the decision gets made for you.
Well, good for him.<eos> Iwantedapurpose... a reason for being on this planet.<eos> But that poetry group looked like an AA meeting. Or a support group.<eos> I saw no one within decades of my age.<eos> Until I saw you.
Should we move?<eos> What?<eos> Should we move? Should we go somewhere and start new?<eos> And... give up the store?<eos> I'll give up the store, give up the house, everything... if I have you.
Did you and Tony talk yesterday?<eos> We sure did.<eos> Okay, and you're just... doing your own thing.<eos> Oh, more than ever.<eos> Okay, look, I understand that you're going through your own process or whatever, but I'm worried about you, man.
I already told you, it's not mine.<eos> Somebody must've slipped it in my bag.<eos> Do you have any idea who?<eos> Who told you to check my bag? Start with them.<eos> Your classmates are concerned about you, and so are we.
How do you know?<eos> I know.<eos> I have to give up the case. I can't take it to trial.<eos> To protect Clay?<eos> Or you and me?
No.<eos> Clay, you don't understand.<eos> I do understand.<eos> Every drama has to be your drama, or it doesn't count.<eos> Somehow this is all about you.
I'm digging this role reversal, by the way.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> You got this rebel with a cause thing going on.<eos> Well... that's me.<eos> - Jeff's a good influence on you. - You think?
You're good and kind... and decent.<eos> And I didn't deserve to be with someone like you.<eos> I never would.<eos> I would have ruined you.<eos> It wasn't you.
Come on, you scooch down.<eos> You're safe now, Flo. Safe with us.<eos> OK? No-one's ever gonna take you away.<eos> OK. Love you, sweetheart.<eos> Love you, too.
No!<eos> No way would jesse kill Gale. Not a chance.<eos> Bye, sweetheart.<eos> Bye, Daddy, I love you.<eos> Love you, too.
What we did back there, what we're doing now, making a future for Judith and for Glenn and Maggie's baby, fighting the fight, that's living.<eos> You showed me that.<eos> You can lose me.<eos> - No. - Yes, you can.<eos> - I can lose you.
Me, too.<eos> No.<eos> The hilltop has to be ready for what happens after.<eos> Maggie needs you.<eos> She needs you, too.
What the fuck happened last night?<eos> You won Coach of the Year.<eos> Yeah.<eos> How was my speech?<eos> To quote you, you were.
You win, you go out on your own terms.<eos> You lose... they push you the fuck out.<eos> Couldn't finish.<eos> What happens if you lose again?<eos> Where does that put you?
It's about time you spent some fucking money on me.<eos> I love it.<eos> Bring a sports coat, okay?<eos> - Classy night tonight.<eos> - Okay. Yeah. I'll have a car sent for you.
You do things the right way.<eos> Hi, Maya.<eos> Hello, beautiful girl.<eos> Hi.<eos> You know, I'm pissed at you.
Police report?<eos> Yeah.<eos> He provoked me.<eos> - Wait.<eos> He provoked you?
Hey, when was the last fucking time<eos> - we hung out, bro? - Shh.<eos> No. When's the last time we hung out?<eos> I miss my fucking friend, man.<eos> No homo. I miss you, bro.
So is Garo.<eos> Good.<eos> I hope they turn all fuckin' purple and sweaty.<eos> Can you stop?<eos> To you.
I hope they turn all fuckin' purple and sweaty.<eos> Can you stop?<eos> To you.<eos> Come on.<eos> To you.
Big, flashy house in the hills.<eos> Goodlookin' boy.<eos> He's fucked a lot of the girls that you've heard of.<eos> This will be good for you.<eos> There is a lot of people counting on you today, love.
- Me?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Did you believe they were going to get a weapon?<eos> Listen, man.<eos> I'm not trying to jam you up.
Yeah, I need to cancel that, too.<eos> No, I'm gonna be away for about a month.<eos> II'll, once I settle back in, I'll... I'll give you guys a call.<eos> Thanks. Hey.<eos> We're ready for you.
How long is this gonna take?<eos> A couple of hours.<eos> They need some singles, some of you and Nate, and then some shots of you training.<eos> This is gonna take all day.<eos> Well, we're waiting on you, diva.
- You look pretty!<eos> - Thank you!<eos> Hey, um, Amy, it's me.<eos> Yeah, I know it's loud 'cause I'm at my brother's fight right now.<eos> He was just askin' about you.
Okay, right here to the left.<eos> Come on.<eos> - How did you get a lanyard? - Ryan.<eos> Why are you fucking with me?<eos> - It ain't always about you, you know?
You've been keeping your lip zipped about it since Grandpa got arrested, but the fact is, you're freaking stoked to bail on him.<eos> He bails on everybody!<eos> He bailed on Mom when she was a kid!<eos> He... He bailed on tiny planet!<eos> And in case I never made this clear to you, Summer, he bailed on you.
- It's anti-pickle serum.<eos> Your kids think it might be anti-pickle serum.<eos> My kids pee their desks and suck on unbaked vases.<eos> They're just angry at me for divorcing their father.<eos> I never said I was angry at you.
They said, invitation said "No Shoes."<eos> Imagine wearing a suit and no shoes.<eos> Still real nice.<eos> But small, only like 10 people.<eos> Ah but you went?
Yeah. Harald's not here.<eos> What do you mean, he's not here?<eos> I saw him with us!<eos> Hey. You know it's okay.<eos> No one's angry with you.
I said, what's going on here?<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> Blacksmith pays for these.<eos> Jeweler pays for these.<eos> The law pays for you.
It is far from a foregone conclusion that they'll be inclined to offer me their help.<eos> But, given our state of affairs, it seems more than worth a try.<eos> And unlike in the past... I now have something to offer them that may make the ask more attractive.<eos> What's that?<eos> You.
Meanwhile... the door will be open for you to reach your grandfather and gain his aid.<eos> Why you?<eos> Why not have someone else lead him away?<eos> Because he won't leave that position to chase someone else.<eos> He'd chase you, and I believe, given the opportunity, he might chase me for a chance at ending this regime once and for all.
500 pieces?<eos> You think you're worth more?<eos> To the right people.<eos> Who?<eos> Who would pay so much for you?
I do not want to be your friend.<eos> What I want is for all of this to end.<eos> For it to end, you must end.<eos> I imagine I have some obligation to surrender you to Captain Berringer, but the spectacle he would make of your trial and execution would only fan the flames of what is burning in Nassau now.<eos> I am tempted to put the sword to you and your man both, and bury this story for good, but what am I... if I spend my days pleading for a return to civility and then do dark things under the cover of night?
But instead, I am stuck here for as long as it takes to fix this.<eos> In order to do that, you are going to have to give me something to fix it with.<eos> But you'd better come up with something of value I can use to get him to walk away from this.<eos> You think you can control him.<eos> And by the time you realize he has been controlling you, it is going to be too late.
Neither.<eos> Knows you from New York.<eos> Says you guys were hunting buddies.<eos> Christ, it's good to see you.<eos> Good to see you, too.
Suit yourself, Sheriff.<eos> Everybody knows you just like to ride that horse.<eos> Giddyup.<eos> - I love you.<eos> - I love you, too.
Me and Ray?<eos> Is that what he's telling you? Varga?<eos> - 'Cause that's just crazy.<eos> - Is it? You really think I'm...<eos> In the face of all logic, that somehow I decided, me, the partner in a multi-million dollar corporation, that I decided to what, turn on you?
But I know a boss when I see one.<eos> Very good.<eos> You just added a zero to your salary.<eos> That's okay. I already got a job.<eos> Blackmailing you.
Better get to the ladies and clean yourself up 'cause we got some heavy drinking to do and I can't have people thinking I forced you.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Yeah. We got the bond of the uniform.<eos> Plus, I like you.<eos> I like you, too.
You carrying his groceries for him, Kessler?<eos> The guy who killed Alex is on death row because of him, so yeah, I am.<eos> You guys got nothing better to do, Toby?<eos> A cop killer walks into a police station, he's going to draw a crowd.<eos> But don't worry, I won't let them hurt you.
Stop being ratchet.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Miss Prissy, didn't mean to get real on you, but you know, kids cost.<eos> 'Cause they want to eat and have clothes to wear.<eos> And a place to sleep, and, yeah, they want to be somebody when they grow up, and that shit's on you.
Have him call me when he gets back.<eos> No, look.<eos> You're just going to tell Judge Harris the name, he's going to tell me.<eos> So what's the difference?<eos> I know him, I don't know you, okay?
Ma, she asked a question.<eos> I answered it.<eos> Of course you did.<eos> Why should I be so surprised you wait until you can take it out on me?<eos> Take it out on you.
No, no, no.<eos> We're here now.<eos> We are here and I would like to know.<eos> Did you ever once stop to think about how it would affect my sisters or me?<eos> You?
Tired, Trini.<eos> I want to leave this world, or get married, and read fairy tales.<eos> - Why don't you then?<eos> - No woman could love me.<eos> You?
I feel I failed you.<eos> You've never failed me.<eos> - An advantage of being fickle.<eos> - You never were with me.<eos> When I look at you, I see myself reflected in your eyes.
Uh, I see why he thinks he's being over-medicated.<eos> These I'm not even dealing with.<eos> It's just the Primidone.<eos> It's downstairs by his bed. I left it there.<eos> After he threw the glass at you.
Unfortunately, that's not an option.<eos> Mossad can't be trusted to be even remotely objective on this, and the accusation is too serious to ignore.<eos> Well, what do you suggest?<eos> You recommend somebody absolutely trustworthy to represent US interests on the ground there.<eos> Like you, for example? No.
For what?<eos> Exposing an FBI informant, for one thing.<eos> That asshole?<eos> He deserves what's comin'.<eos> It's you I'm worried about.
You're 20 years old and angry, so I'm gonna forgive you for saying that.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I told you, take down the video.<eos> Can't do that.<eos> You leave it up, and you're just waving a red flag in front of the FBI and thumbing your nose at all the people who believed in you.
Now it's my turn to say "no."<eos> The question is... what do we do now?<eos> - We?<eos> - Yes.<eos> This puts us in a bad situation... you and me.
I was up here anyway, briefing the president-elect at the Millbrook offsite.<eos> What's she make of it? The bombing?<eos> I'd say she's still processing.<eos> You could tell, though, she's... not chastened, exactly, but a little more open.<eos> Open to you.
I told you, I can't call the police.<eos> A bomb has been planted. An FBI agent is dead.<eos> I-I don't know who these people are, but they are serious.<eos> And they're connected.<eos> I'm worried about you.
You really--<eos> You really believe that?<eos> He was just in my house, you fucking moron.<eos> - What?<eos> - In my house looking for you.
The guy you sent.<eos> Where is he?<eos> I would never hurt you.<eos> He was just in my house, you fucking moron.<eos> - What? - In my house looking for you.
Do I give up, roll over?<eos> Do you see me resigning?<eos> I am the next president of the United States.<eos> Sixty million people voted for me.<eos> Who the hell voted for you?
You're still out there going a million miles an hour.<eos> You will hit a wall.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Damn it.<eos> I'm worried about you.
_ What's this?<eos> A work in progress.<eos> It's not ready yet.<eos> I am the next president of the United States.<eos> Who the hell voted for you?
I don't care so much I fucking dropped everything when your hooker girlfriend showed up out of the blue and said you needed me.<eos> You had no choice.<eos> - Oh, believe me, I did.<eos> - You owe me. - And why's that?<eos> - Because you made me this way!
And it's not just the mission.<eos> It never has been.<eos> You got to let me go.<eos> You talk to him yet?<eos> I've been waiting for you.
You're worried she's gonna say no.<eos> You are such a guy, Charlie... in a good way.<eos> She's gonna say yes.<eos> Yeah, what makes you say that?<eos> Because I've seen the way that she looks at you and...
Red-haired women!<eos> To the shield wall that awaits us!<eos> To the joy of battle!<eos> And to the blood of the Scots!<eos> Ah, Father Hrothweard, we've been waiting for you.
I mean, it can't be your wife 'cause haven't got a wife.<eos> I mean, it-- shit, I know who you're talking about.<eos> You're talking about your dog, aren't ya?<eos> Yep.<eos> Yeah, well, I'm afraid little Ginny's gonna have to wait for you to come home tonight because, uh, you're on duty.
They didn't take me.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down, slow down. Let's just talk for a sec.<eos> They didn't take me.<eos> Buddy, they didn't take most of us.<eos> You're not alone, trust me.
You're building a boat.<eos> For the flood.<eos> I need to get to the hospital in Kurripa.<eos> Any chance you guys could give me a ride there?<eos> Lady of the house will take better care of you than the hospital.
Three wise men.<eos> Hi, this is Kevin Garvey.<eos> Leave a message.<eos> I don't know if you're getting my messages, but I'm sure you're aware there's been a nuclear incident in the South Pacific, but I've secured transportation.<eos> I'm coming to get you, Kevin.
But the secure location can only be accessed by my exact biometrics.<eos> Is... is that supposed to make sense to me?<eos> It doesn't make sense to me.<eos> I love you, son.<eos> I love you, too.
I'm gonna take these off because I know you're here of your own free will, and the last thing you wanna do is hurt yourself.<eos> All right, gentlemen.<eos> Let's get to the hard part, shall we?<eos> I, Patricia Levin, in my capacity as Secretary of Defense hereby invoke the Fisher Protocol, overriding the Heart Deterrent pursuant to the nuclear command authority granted by Article Two, Section Two of the US Constitution.<eos> The president shall make an incision two inches below the sternum of the volunteer... that's you... whereupon the president, gaining access from beneath the ribcage, shall manually extract the launch key from behind the left atrium.
Your brother is here with us.<eos> Hello, Nora.<eos> Hi, Matt.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too.
You want the truth?<eos> When Matt told me you were gone, I didn't believe him.<eos> Or I couldn't.<eos> I had this feeling that you were still alive... and that I would see you again.<eos> And then... then Matt died and you weren't even at the funeral.
When you and I last saw each other... you had every reason to see me killed.<eos> Certainly would've solved a lot of problems for you.<eos> And yet you didn't.<eos> Why?<eos> You know, I've had a rough few days owing to you.
Draw everyone's attention away from himself.<eos> You did do all those things.<eos> I know I did.<eos> But always with a man behind me doing his damnedest to bend it all to his benefit.<eos> My father, Scott, Charles, you.
I think they'd appreciate my loyalty.<eos> Oh, let me take this, it's Rebecca.<eos> Ask her what she thinks.<eos> I will.<eos> Everyone's been asking after you, darling.
I'm fine. I'm fine, baby.<eos> Listen, this whole thing with Ben is winding down, and we cleared the guy running CTU.<eos> Does that mean we can go home?<eos> Soon.<eos> I'm-a come get you, and... we can start to put this whole thing behind us. Okay?
I'm-a come get you, and... we can start to put this whole thing behind us. Okay?<eos> Listen, Nicole I know I haven't been hearing you.<eos> And I know I got a lot of things that I need to work on. But I promise you, I promise you things are gonna be different.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too.
Excuse me, ma'am.<eos> We're ready.<eos> She's in here.<eos> I had them set up video and audio before they sequestered her.<eos> Your guests are expecting you outside, you should get back to them.
Thousands!<eos> The squad.<eos> Their families. Their children.<eos> Your mother, your sister...<eos> They're all dead 'cause of you, Ben!
What, you already went through them?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I tweaked some parameters, so you're good to go.<eos> Can thank me later.<eos> I know you think Mullins is looking to get rid of you.
They got away.<eos> You said you had a gun, though? !<eos> I did, but what was I supposed to do?<eos> No, no.<eos> I'm supposed to be protecting you.
Yeah, I... I thought so, too.<eos> Eric, what is going on?<eos> Listen, I want you to go to Christine's, and I'm gonna come get you as soon as I can, okay?<eos> I love you, Nicole.<eos> I love you, too.
You're welcome.<eos> It's just been real hard lately, you know?<eos> I know.<eos> Hasn't been the same since you left.<eos> So, what, he's waiting for you now?
I'll, uh, I'll call them right now.<eos> Are you meeting me there?<eos> [sighs] I'll see you soon.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too.
Oh, is that what it would take to get you to stay, hmm?<eos> This is the only thing I know how to do.<eos> You don't know what you can do until you try.<eos> You're smart, Isaac.<eos> You know, I got faith in you.
And then, we die.<eos> Which seems... I don't know... Like a waste of a perfectly good virus.<eos> Andy, you talk a lot when you're stressed.<eos> Look, you'll figure it out.<eos> I have faith in you, man.
You got three seconds.<eos> What the hell are you doing here?<eos> You left CTU with your laptop and your development kit in the middle of a terrorist event.<eos> That's not normal behavior.<eos> Even for you.
Because I'm gonna free my wife and my brother, and we're gonna end this once and for all.<eos> Andy, let's go.<eos> I'll see you in another life.<eos> Tell me where Nicole at. Where's Nicole?<eos> I was worried about you. I'm all right.
Knew the people to call.<eos> 'Cause you've done this before, haven't you?<eos> Another day at the office.<eos> It's not like that, John.<eos> I look at you and I don't even know who you are anymore.
I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Give him another dose.<eos> I see that you were able to organize this really quick.<eos> It's not like that, John.<eos> I look at you and I don't even know who you are anymore.
And I know that you can bring Rebecca around.<eos> I mean, if anybody understands that sometimes short-term compromises have to be made for the greater good...<eos> - You're serious. - ...it's Rebecca.<eos> She understands that sort of thing.<eos> There were over a hundred innocent people that were killed on that bridge because of you.
Desperation can make you do terrible things.<eos> And it can make you keep them from the people you love because because you don't want them to see that part of you.<eos> Rebecca, I may not know you like I thought I did, but I do know one thing.<eos> I don't want to lose you.<eos> I don't want to lose you, either.
He's just gonna keep asking you a few more questions, okay?<eos> - Okay, I'll be right back.<eos> - Hi, Jennifer.<eos> How are you feeling?<eos> Look, I'm s-so sorry I couldn't wait for you.
It's obvious that you need all the help that you can get now.<eos> Sir, I'm perfectly willing to take responsibility for everything that's gone wrong, but...<eos> Daniel' s an administrator.<eos> H-He has no field experience and...<eos> Which is why I'm keeping you there to fill the gaps. - Sir...
That's one way to get rid of your boat.<eos> Hey, drive him to school today?<eos> I was planning on it.<eos> Love you.<eos> Love you too.
There you go.<eos> Alright yeah- throw strong. Come on, son.<eos> Yeah, alright.<eos> Let's do this.<eos> I haven't seen you around here before. I'm...
Why are you doing this?<eos> Please...<eos> What is this, you sick fuck!<eos> I learned this from you.<eos> I put you under the same surveillance you put my country under with your satellites and your drones.
You were my sister.<eos> There is very little that I remember from when I was young, but I remember this.<eos> You were older. You were beautiful.<eos> I revered you.<eos> When you were told that my mother and I were dead, I have to believe that it affected you.
I revered you.<eos> When you were told that my mother and I were dead, I have to believe that it affected you.<eos> You had just lost your mother.<eos> But if things were as I remember, my mother and I were your family, too.<eos> And yet, through all the years thereafter that my father cared for you... counseled you, labored for you... he never told you that we were alive.
She must have done well.<eos> I've found myself thinking about it.<eos> Of walking away from Nassau, from England, from civilization.<eos> One can be happy that way, can't they?<eos> A life of isolation and uncertainty as long as it is lived with someone you love... And who loves you back. It is possible, isn't it?
She listened.<eos> She told me she ain't got no apology... for what she'd done.<eos> I know.<eos> Part of me wanted to lash out.<eos> Betrayed you.
- They weren't going to.<eos> Your arcade idea was good.<eos> That weasel was just too pompous to admit it.<eos> But still! You took a big chance.<eos> Because I believed in you.
Yeah. There is.<eos> They waited an hour before disbanding.<eos> Evidently, that is the lifespan of "the governor is on his way" as a viable measure of delay.<eos> The solution to our problems is not going to come from a council meeting.<eos> They are losing faith in you.
There were men I knew that would've killed you for me.<eos> I wanted to ask them.<eos> Had the money.<eos> But Max refused.<eos> I couldn't tell then if it was because she was afraid of you.
A temporary solution to a long-term problem.<eos> BPO.<eos> - How do you avoid them?<eos> - You don't.<eos> But they're not hunting you.
I wouldn't be alive if you hadn't helped me.<eos> Those men who attacked you, they were hired by your brother?<eos> Good.<eos> Why good?<eos> Because... he must be very afraid of you to do something like that.
I'm sorry.<eos> Did something else happen?<eos> Something's always happening.<eos> Something happened to the cluster?<eos> There was a protest in India, a riot over water in Nairobi. But mostly I was just worried about you.
- Please, listen to me.<eos> I don't want to waste any more time listening to your excuses.<eos> Fuck.<eos> That's it! I'm done.<eos> I'm done with you, I am done with them.
I'm sorry I failed you.<eos> - Angelica.<eos> - I'm here.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you.
I've been through it a million times with the lawyers.<eos> Really. I mean, these reports are mostly done for the sake of appearances.<eos> - But...<eos> - What matters is that we ship on time.<eos> Our clients are depending on us, as I am depending on you.
It's official.<eos> I'm dead.<eos> Hello.<eos> It's good to see you.<eos> Good to see you, too.
And then something happened to me.<eos> Someone reminded me to look up.<eos> And I wanted to tell that someone thank you.<eos> I wanted to tell you that I love you.<eos> I love you.
Food, some clothes, money.<eos> I do not know how to thank you.<eos> Nothing I have done in my life exceeds the honor to have been your teacher.<eos> Sometimes, I find her staring at the gate.<eos> I know she's waiting for you.
Good morning, Mr. Secretary.<eos> The Chairman is very excited.<eos> It's a very big day for us.<eos> - It is.<eos> - We are counting on you.
I've been through it a million times with the lawyers.<eos> Really. I mean, these reports are mostly done for the sake of appearances.<eos> - But...<eos> - What matters is that we ship on time.<eos> Our clients are depending on us, as I am depending on you.
It's official.<eos> I'm dead.<eos> Hello.<eos> It's good to see you.<eos> Good to see you, too.
And then something happened to me.<eos> Someone reminded me to look up.<eos> And I wanted to tell that someone thank you.<eos> I wanted to tell you that I love you.<eos> I love you.
Why do you think she would be listed as a missing person?<eos> We know she was scared.<eos> We know she went through a lot of trouble to meet with you.<eos> - Which means that...<eos> - Whoever's after you is probably after her.
- Whoever's after you is probably after her.<eos> He's a good cop.<eos> It also means they're gonna come after anyone who tries to help us.<eos> What'd he say?<eos> He's just worried about you.
I think someone is driving him.<eos> Who?<eos> Wolfgang.<eos> Sebastian, be careful.<eos> If something happened to you, I don't know what I would do.
Thank you.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> He's never called me "daughter."<eos> - I love you.<eos> - I love you, too.
Carol Cumberland took a bunch of pills and slit her wrists.<eos> Why?<eos> Why was Jonas there?<eos> Are you asking me or someone else in your head?<eos> You.
There are government agents saying all kinds of fucked up shit about you.<eos> - Dad, are you drinking?<eos> - What do you care?<eos> - You're not supposed to be drinking, Dad.<eos> - You're not here!
I will send him a thank-you note.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Kala, just listen.<eos> I need you to do something for me, and I know this will be difficult because I need you to do it without asking a lot of questions, which I'm telling you right now that I cannot answer.<eos> I have not told you about lots of things that are going on because I have been trying to protect you... and maybe, selfishly, our marriage.
- Tell me.<eos> How much I love you... would it have done any good?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - How?<eos> Because it would help me admit how much I love you.
Oh, my God. What happened?<eos> I'm okay.<eos> What you said on that stage was good for people to hear.<eos> You were amazing.<eos> I want to grow up so I can vote for you.
Put your elbow inside the knee and work the elbow escape.<eos> Yeah, I'll do all that next time.<eos> When you can master moves like this, you can generate offense out of defense, even off your back.<eos> Showtime, folks.<eos> He's waiting on you.
I'll die off.<eos> And that's before I blew lunch with you not being a vegan.<eos> Of course I'm a vegan.<eos> Here's my problem.<eos> The shit that I do to keep most people after an internship... Throwing money around, showing them a good time... None of that's gonna work on you.
I'm not allowed to ink clients at the shop yet.<eos> I'm just an apprentice.<eos> Yeah, uh, but apparently that doesn't mean much here.<eos> My boss is a little territorial and even if I did get her on board, I still need someone to work on.<eos> You?
My father...<eos> -Come on, baby. It's okay.<eos> -My father...<eos> You killed my father.<eos> You're the reason he died.
I wish I was there.<eos> Maybe I could've... protected you.<eos> You see, all those people want... is someone to keep them from what they're afraid to know.<eos> And what are the president and First Lady doing tonight, Francis?<eos> Well, I believe Thomas is waiting for you.
But I promise I'll handle it on the outside. No.<eos> What you mean, "No"?<eos> I mean, you wanna shoot somebody, every time you take a bad beat, then you can go back to throwing bones in the alley with your corner boys.<eos> I'm sorry, Vince.<eos> I respect you. I respect your place.
But that's not your problem.<eos> Your problem is that you didn't tell me that covering for you with Mr. Success was putting my family in the crosshairs of some ex-cop gangster and some still-cop psycho looking to pay you back for taking his eye.<eos> He didn't lose the eye.<eos> They are gonna get to me sooner or later, okay?<eos> Now, you know, no matter how pissed off I am at you, and I fucking am, that I would never wanna see you get hurt...
Couldn't be more than 17 years old.<eos> The kind of kid who would smile when he got nervous, you know?<eos> Even when you're smacking him around, he'd smile.<eos> It's the damndest thing.<eos> And he'd look up at you with these big, brown Bambi eyes. Oh, boy.
I remember you, of course.<eos> The disgusting insinuations you made after the inquest.<eos> - I wrote the truth.<eos> - I loved my sister.<eos> Well, she didn't love you.
Hey. We'll figure it out.<eos> Either way.<eos> I know.<eos> I love you.<eos> Love you.
Looks like someone forgot to do laundry.<eos> You wanna move it to the side for me, cowboy?<eos> It's in my way.<eos> - What?<eos> - I'm super mad at you.
Is there anybody else here with you?<eos> No.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> I chased them away with my sadness.<eos> And I'll chase you away, too.
There.<eos> - There. - RORY: I see it.<eos> All right, here we go, here we go, here we go.<eos> This is fun. SHO:<eos> Rory, you have to move. It's gonna hit you.
Now I dictate how you live yours.<eos> I know you.<eos> I'm the only one who really knows you.<eos> You're gonna take everything I give you, and you're gonna act like you like it, and you're gonna beg for more.<eos> And I'm not just gonna punish you.
This your malpractice confession for the Civil War surgery you did on my shoulder?<eos> Thought you were on self-appointed desk duty.<eos> Sitting gets me closer to the ground for when I got to pass out.<eos> If it's that bad, go home.<eos> You were shot too, you know, so don't put it all on me.
What the hell is wrong with you?<eos> You know me.<eos> - You lied to me.<eos> - You lied to me again!<eos> It kills me that somebody's trying to hurt you.
You like being interrogated?<eos> Yes, please.<eos> I don't want to go to jail.<eos> I'll do whatever you ask.<eos> Tell me about the other cop that interrogated you.
I better get going and, uh, find some babies to kiss or something.<eos> Home safe.<eos> Safe tomorrow.<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> I didn't mean to scare you.
What happened?<eos> I thought I might be in trouble... the worst kind.<eos> And I wanted you with Gemma because I needed to know that you were safe.<eos> You're a cop.<eos> What could you have possibly done that would get you arrested?
You're a miracle.<eos> Look, I am who I am because of you.<eos> - You have to know that.<eos> - No.<eos> What I know is that I let you down, that every time I had a real choice, I chose wrong.
I thought we were talking about it.<eos> No, that's not what I'm talking about.<eos> Oh. That.<eos> Me.<eos> Yeah. You.
I have an obligation to educate, not eliminate all the problems of Beacon Hills.<eos> I have to run a school, and you have to go enroll in one.<eos> You know the saying, "If you see something, say something."<eos> Please stop.<eos> Honey, I care about you and your friends.
I have to run a school, and you have to go enroll in one.<eos> You know the saying, "If you see something, say something."<eos> Please stop.<eos> Honey, I care about you and your friends.<eos> But mostly, I care about you.
Alice.<eos> Apology accepted.<eos> That was you apologizing for what you did.<eos> I just... if we survive this, I hope we can be friends still.<eos> I know it may sound stupid, but that's what I'm mad at you for, not... not the cheating part.
It's what makes you feel the pain will burn you till there's nothing.<eos> And, yes, it's also there for love, but, uh, let's be frank, darling, you're more likely to throw yourself off a bridge than ever love again.<eos> I felt that way.<eos> And I knew it crippled me when I needed to be strong.<eos> As you do now.
Pay more attention on your duty than my calls.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> - Take her to the hospital for the medical.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Listen, Mr. Chaube has sent a car for you.
Su..<eos> - Why don't you get it, what they're doing to us?<eos> Please!<eos> - But..<eos> I was molested, but they have been ill-treating you too.
This is my revenge.<eos> Hey!<eos> You didn't kill Supriya.<eos> - No..<eos> So, I won't kill you.
How did you get out of that colony?<eos> Zaffar.<eos> - Yes, Rohan.<eos> - Listen.<eos> I need Percy, Sakharam and you.
We're charging you additionally with the murders of Jim Blackwell and Audrey Ellis.<eos> Norman is nice... okay, he's kind, he's a good person... but he just... he has another side to him.<eos> You know, I don't...<eos> I don't know what you'd call it, maybe multiple personalities or something, but he... he changes.<eos> I'm coming for you when you least expect it.
She's innocent.<eos> Stop it. Stop crying.<eos> Alex, what happened to you?<eos> I don't understand any of this.<eos> This isn't about you, Regina.
Thanks.<eos> Just, uh, tell me that's for protecting your wife and your daughter.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And me.<eos> And you?
Dylan, you have to tell her.<eos> She doesn't give a shit about Norman.<eos> If I tell her, then they're gonna rush in there, and he's gonna end up dead.<eos> Well, I don't care. I don't care about Norman.<eos> I care about you.
Uh, can I get a piece of ID, please?<eos> Of course.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Welcome to CedarRidge.<eos> This gives you access to Ward One, but no patient contact until tomorrow, OK?
Mademoiselle Bourienne.<eos> When?<eos> No.<eos> When I've heard from your father that you've learnt to behave yourselves, then I'll give you my hand to kiss.<eos> Well, then, I shall wish you ladies goodnight.
Any other injuries besides the gunshot wounds?<eos> Ah, don't answer that.<eos> This is the 82nd's case.<eos> Okay?<eos> So, you two are done here.
Straight as they come.<eos> It stinks like patchouli oil in here.<eos> Hey, who are we looking for again?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Sorry to bother you ladies, but could you tell where I would find a... Lon Stober or Donald Duncan?
Can you imagine the wear and tear?<eos> But for us, for our baby?<eos> Honey, honey, he's a doctor with a face like a movie star and a body that looks like it should be throwing thunderbolts from a cloud.<eos> If you want our baby to have the best head start, this is how we do it.<eos> Can I help you ladies?
God forbid!<eos> At noon or we die.<eos> I have to make a call.<eos> Sorry, you must get out after the overpass.<eos> I'll hail you another cab.
Is Mercury to pasture?<eos> We lost her last winter.<eos> Sorry to hear that.<eos> Hello again.<eos> - Can I help you ladies?
Mom, it's been two days.<eos> I mean, I haven't not spoken to him in two days since I met him.<eos> Well, why don't you let him come to you in his own time?<eos> Yeah, but what if he doesn't call me?<eos> I'll just give you ladies a minute.
You haven't...? You haven't seen this guy?<eos> My buddy, have you seen...?<eos> You're not listening to me.<eos> Good day, miss.<eos> Oh, that's why you're not... Good day.
Tell them to lay down.<eos> There you go.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> There you go.<eos> Mr. Pushkin thanks you very much.
Thank you very much.<eos> There you go.<eos> Mr. Pushkin thanks you very much.<eos> We're going out of business. Closing down shop.<eos> Mr. Pushkin thanks you very much.
What was that? Glass of...<eos> (DISTORTED) chardonnay, please.<eos> A-and for you, ma'am?<eos> I'll have... (HIGH-PITCHED TONE)<eos> I'm gonna get you some water and I'll be right back with those drinks.
I don't know what the legal words are but just for being gross.<eos> We can't afford to be sued.<eos> We can't even afford the lawyer on those bus ads who has a gavel in one hand and a chicken in the other.<eos> I hope everything was satisfactory.<eos> Can I get you ladies anything else...
M-May I see that?<eos> Sure.<eos> Is that the address they checked in with?<eos> Yes.<eos> How can I help you ladies?
I, um... I actually drive a vintage BMW.<eos> From 1994.<eos> Hey, I'm Kives.<eos> Pleasure.<eos> Yeah, um, ladies, can I just ask you a very quick question?
So... what's on the menu that won't kill me?<eos> The apple cobbler is wonderful.<eos> They use organic apples and they season it...<eos> Okay, okay. Cobbler.<eos> Can I get you both something?
That's horrible.<eos> No one's ever asked.<eos> Hello, ladies.<eos> I am Cecilia, and I have the gift of sight.<eos> Could I offer you a reading?
Well, I like gals.<eos> First, I just want to say thank you.<eos> I feel very... cool and...<eos> Yeah, it's like I can breathe again.<eos> Well, I'm glad you got your chill back.
What does that even mean?<eos> It means...<eos> I don't know.<eos> I heard it in a movie.<eos> May I help you ladies?
And I wish you would admonish Ms. Crozier for constantly summarizing her case to the jury.<eos> This is the equivalent of advertising through repetition.<eos> I don't even know what that means.<eos> I'm just speaking from the heart.<eos> Thank you very much, both of you.
Hello, shalom.<eos> Very good, you wanna squeeze in a couple more before sundown?<eos> Wow, you're as bad as me trying to be Irish at the blarney rose for a free beer.<eos> Yar, can I get me a cerveza?<eos> What can I get you ladies, besides skirts that are more appropriate?
On the day that he died,<eos> Walter Danzig was delivering a summons to the owner of a motorcycle shop.<eos> And that motorcycle shop specializes in "ghost on" paint.<eos> Well, let's go.<eos> - What can I do for you ladies?
Any man would marry Katherine Glendenning.<eos> Hasn't enough time passed now?<eos> You deserve to marry again.<eos> Ladies, good afternoon!<eos> Let me help you to decide which fabrics to choose.
I'd hate to be stuck here.<eos> Well, a lot of people like living like that.<eos> Yeah, well, not me.<eos> Excitement's what I crave.<eos> Ladies, good day to you.
Yeah, lattice-based.<eos> Wow, that's, uh...<eos> Sam... Sam!<eos> Heel.<eos> I am sorry. I don't know what the hotel mismanager told you about me, Ms. Maigret, but I don't do lost luggage.
- I shouldn't.<eos> - I shouldn't worry too much.<eos> We'll know much more when he's rested.<eos> I'm very grateful, milady.<eos> To both of you.
I loved your speech.<eos> I loved your heroism.<eos> It puts me to shame.<eos> Nice talking to you, sir.<eos> No, let me get you guys a drink.
IN FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE. - WHAT CAN I GET YOU, LADIES?
I don't think you understand how serious a matter...<eos> Close your menu.<eos> What?<eos> Close your menu, so they know we're ready to order.<eos> I'll give you another moment.
Hey.<eos> He's kind of cute.<eos> A doorman.<eos> - What's up?<eos> - Hi, can I help you, ladies?
- Yes, and this is my partner, Tina Kennard.<eos> Hi.<eos> It's a very beautiful family.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I don't plan on keeping you long, but I'm sure you understand I've gotta ask a few questions.
- Not lt.<eos> - Not cool. You guys know I stink at "not lt."<eos> Come on, Billy.<eos> Good afternoon, ladies.<eos> What has this fine day brought for you?
Wait a minute.<eos> This is the dumbest thing I ever heard.<eos> Your team is winning and your team is winning, but you both figured out a way to lose money on it.<eos> Well, all I know is the Giants are gonna lose before the Jets.<eos> I'll tell you what. If the Giants lose before the Jets, the barbershop will pay for you ladies to have a night out on the town.
Send it back. - [ Laughing ]<eos> - Come on.<eos> Let's find Alex's desk.<eos> - God bless us, every one.<eos> May I help you ladies?
- Hey, Dad<eos> Tommy, see if there's any meat sauce<eos> - The spicy stuff<eos> - OK<eos> Did I tell you about the night classes Tommy's takin'?
Well, whatever you think is appropriate.<eos> Fine.<eos> I just thought if we were going to focus on a time in Rex's life, that we might as well focus on the happiest time.<eos> let's talk flowers.<eos> Now I know lilies are traditional, but I think I can get you a deal on some white roses.
And that meant, after all her time in America... finally entering a foreign land.<eos> Hello? Yeah, hi.<eos> We're here for the interview with Mrs. Clasky?<eos> Oh, great.<eos> You made it. Come on in.
So she's not going to be here at all tonight. No, I'm afraid not.<eos> Okay, I guess we can just... You know, we'll just go have dinner in the pool house with Dad.<eos> Mr. Gilmore is out of town.<eos> - He is? - Till Tuesday. We've officially become afterthoughts.<eos> Would you like me to make you two something for dinner?
And where are they tonight?<eos> They are at a party that I was not invited to.<eos> Can you believe that?<eos> They sneak around like little mongrels and I get removed from the A list.<eos> Can I get you ladies anything?
I can't believe that you can get in trouble for having blue lights under the car.<eos> In L.A., everyone who's ghetto has that.<eos> Who do I have to (bleep) around here to get out of a ticket?<eos> Those cops don't seem like one of those cops that you can, like, flirt with.<eos> Okay, ladies. Basically, what I'm gonna do is, I'm gonna issue you a warning for the blue lights.
Got away again.<eos> Well, the girls are working their way across Florida trying to get back home.<eos> But for tonight, home is gonna be a trailer park. - Where are we?<eos> - Brentwood trailer park.<eos> What can I do for you ladies today?
- Tonight.<eos> - Tonight? Okay.<eos> - How old are you? - 13.<eos> Sexy.<eos> Okay, I'll show you to a site.
We'd like to get you started with a little amuse-bouche.<eos> I'd like him to amuse my bush.<eos> - This just looks delicious.<eos> - It's our summer vegetable soup.<eos> I see you guys are set for drinks, I'll give you a minute with the menus.
The Dressler woman - once we find her we'll find the monk.<eos> How do we find her?<eos> She is a police, like him.<eos> Afternoon, ladies.<eos> What can I do for you?
- I don't wanna wait an hour. I'm wearing the wrong shoes for a drive-thru.<eos> What'll people think?<eos> That we're loose women with questionable morals.<eos> It's not right to eat dinner when your feet don't touch the floor.<eos> - What can I get you ladies?
- Can we get you anything else?<eos> - No, thank you.<eos> Couple of female slaves?<eos> There's still a lot of tests I need to do.<eos> Whatever I find out, I promise you, from now on your son is going to feel a great deal better.
Are you not well?<eos> - Don't think of me.<eos> Elinor is well.<eos> - That is enough for both of us.<eos> - How do you enjoy London?
- Ridiculous.<eos> A bunch of wet rags.<eos> - She's crazy.<eos> We're staying in this no-tell motel so be quiet.<eos> - I should have met you outside.
- It's very kind.<eos> - My wife's on stage, and Ronny's still holding the fort for Major Callendar.<eos> His wretched Indian assistant didn't turn up in time, but I got my own back.<eos> I'm sorry about the show.<eos> But what else can we do for you ladies?
I just got my fortune told, see? No, no, no, no, no.<eos> He says he got something for Hattie, but he won't show it to me.<eos> Hattie, you got a gentleman friend!<eos> Oh, excuse me, I...<eos> I didn't mean to disturb you ladies. I...
Ah, this is what it's all about.<eos> You two, you're supposed to be in your rooms! You're not allowed down here tonight. - Remember?<eos> - Ooh, doesn't it look pretty?<eos> What are you cooking?<eos> I'll send you up a menu with your bread and cheese.
A big round of applause for Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson.<eos> Come on. Wonderful.<eos> Thank you so much for coming. Thank you.<eos> Where are we going now?<eos> I want to show you my favourite room.
Yo, yo, just 'cause you got a suit, man, don't mean you own the sidewalk.<eos> What the hell, bro?<eos> Last man out, lawyer's floor is completely clear.<eos> I thought cops had bad hours.<eos> Can I help you gentlemen?
Ones relating to open cases, as well as documents that are sensitive in nature.<eos> Can you think of anybody who'd want to get their hands on those files?<eos> It would certainly be valuable to opposing counsel.<eos> Or someone who wanted to gather information on a client, I suppose.<eos> I wish I could tell you exactly what was stolen, but from what I've been told, it could be some time before it's deemed safe to go in.
No, no, let him go.<eos> Let him go, Arnold. Let him go.<eos> - God. - S-Sorry.<eos> I-I don't know what came over him.<eos> Well, why don't you show them to the meditation space?
Cheers. Cheers.<eos> Oh, the past 12 months for our family here... they've just plain sucked.<eos> I... there's no better way to say that.<eos> Moments that I felt were the darkest, they were eclipsed by complete blackness.<eos> But today... days like today, what you did on the plane, what the rest of our team did on the ground, when our purpose is clear... these are the good days.
I know.<eos> No one touches her.<eos> That's a mistake.<eos> No shit.<eos> Can we get you anything?
The man with the golden ear.<eos> Maury. Mr. Galasso. What a nice surprise.<eos> You want...<eos> Could you not?<eos> Get you a drink?
They're disappearing.<eos> They long ago stopped earning interest, so it's about parking money, not earning.<eos> Our clients want to earn.<eos> Who does handle those?<eos> I think I can put together a couple of names for you.
I didn't feel a thing.<eos> That was Whitney Frost just now.<eos> Underwood, do you have the sample?<eos> What on earth is that?<eos> Gentlemen, thank you for agreeing to this meeting.
You need my help.<eos> The necklace is equipped with a tracking device.<eos> You'll be obtaining a blood sample from Miss Frost.<eos> Oh, my gosh.<eos> Are you okay? Thank you for agreeing to this meeting.
At ease, gentlemen.<eos> Is that schnapps, by any chance?<eos> This will go no further.<eos> I have just told the former Kaiser that the Führer has, under strict conditions, and for the good of the Fatherland, agreed to bring him back from exile to take up his throne once more in Berlin.<eos> I have to tell you now that this is a deception.
No. I'm sorry, he didn't.<eos> May I ask... do you not speak?<eos> He asked me not to.<eos> Well, that's something you should work on, along with what was going on in my, uh, waiting room.<eos> I can refer you to somebody.
We can cut the head off before they get bigger if we strike now.<eos> If the threat level increases, we'll reassess.<eos> Sir, we have a very limited window.<eos> General, the president's made his decision.<eos> Thank you very much, gentlemen.
This triggers the adrenal gland, the release of adrenaline, and that's when things really kick into high gear.<eos> We will pick up with that next week.<eos> Remember to read chapter five.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Can I help you gentlemen?
All right, you just, uh... sit right here, okay?<eos> Hi, hey, you must be the head chef.<eos> We need to see the manager.<eos> It's okay, Mark.<eos> Can I help you, officers?
He's my son.<eos> What is this about? Um, it's a private matter, ma'am.<eos> Because I know you're not here to talk about that expunged assault charge.<eos> We're just looking for a few minutes, that's all.<eos> Why don't I get you the number of our lawyer.
- No, it's not...<eos> - How long has it been, Rog?<eos> You know, I feel just like yesterday, I saw him from across a crowded room... it was a Sadie Hawkins Dance, and neither one of us had a date.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Can I help you two?
This is-<eos> Inspector Steed. Benedict Haughton, Home Office.<eos> I am reliably informed that you have considerable experience of counter surveillance within the Special Branch-<eos> Ive gathered intelligence on various anarchists, sir, including Fenian agitators in Liverpool and Manchester.<eos> I can show you.
I have come to believe that our use of ether is both cavalier and irresponsible.<eos> The drug is risky and overused, and I will prove today that a man can be operated on with no general anesthesia and that that same man can perform the operation himself.<eos> Dr. Gallinger and Dr. Chickering are injecting me with a 2% cocaine solution directly into my spinal canal, which will block all signals of pain from my lower half to my upper.<eos> This is a technique I pioneered myself and one I know to be completely safe if done correctly.<eos> How are you gentlemen doing back there?
Ah, Detective Walker.<eos> Good to see you.<eos> Thanks for squeezing me in, Mr. Lyon.<eos> I understand you found Bunkie's car. Uh, yeah.<eos> We found trace evidence in the vehicle, so I'm obliged to ask you all some questions.
Gotta have an appointment.<eos> Ma! Ma? !<eos> The feebs are here.<eos> Oh, Ethan! Please don't be rude.<eos> How can I help you, agents?
Uh, uh, "Want a diamond, give a BJ."<eos> Uh, uh, how about this one?<eos> If you're gonna get down on your knees, you better be giving a BJ.<eos> We've heard them all, sir.<eos> So, what can we do for you guys?
I think the point is, is that we need you to find him becau... This guy has some serious rage issues.<eos> Has he tried anger management?<eos> Yeah, but it didn't work.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, I have this inscription now, and so if we find him, I'll let you know.
Fish and chips!<eos> Okay, you all remember the plan-- we walk up wearing our Bill Cosby masks...<eos> Peter, that's President Obama.<eos> Aw, did I just do a racism?<eos> Hello? Can I help you gentlemen?
Surrey.<eos> Oh, no need to apologize. That was years ago.<eos> We kicked your butt anyway, so we're cool with it.<eos> Oh, you're a leg-puller!<eos> Let's get you both to your seats.
Inner-City taxi.<eos> Hey!<eos> Inner-City taxi.<eos> Hello?<eos> Can I help you guys?
Hank.<eos> Well, Merry Christmas.<eos> - Merry Christmas, Reverend.<eos> - Merry Christmas, Joe.<eos> Well, what can I do for you gentlemen?
No onions.<eos> You're allergic to onions.<eos> And that's a $23 salad.<eos> Which is why it will not go to waste.<eos> Can I get you anything else?
The transversalis fascia, the transversus abdominis muscle, and the internal oblique muscle to the edge of the inguinal ligament.<eos> Once the wall is created, we suture the external oblique aponeurosis, thus recreating the canal and the external inguinal ring.<eos> Now, failure rates for previous procedures ranged from 30 to 50%.<eos> In our admittedly small sample, the Thackery-Edwards method has a re-herniation rate of only 2%, and that is due to a patient not following proper postoperative instructions.<eos> Our full paper will be available to you all, and we believe you'll have great success with this new procedure, as it is probably the biggest advance in inguinal hernia surgery in the last 100 years.
I gave these guys my word. We've had some bad experiences lately with the pay-up-front business model.<eos> Well, fortunately, the people I represent rely on me precisely because they know I'm not like them.<eos> I dislike beheadings, gentleman.<eos> - So do we. -It's bad for business.<eos> And the fact is, the money in that bag would only buy you insurance against my employers feeling taken advantage of if anything should go wrong in our transaction, so I'm willing to proceed without it.
How do we get him down?<eos> Let me call him in for you.<eos> Jay, bring it in.<eos> Five-O wants to talk to you.<eos> Can I help you gentlemen?
You know how that can get.<eos> Rubia Sucia.<eos> You all come by.<eos> When the curfew ends.<eos> I'll treat you right.
- He hasn't won.<eos> You tell him!<eos> - Off duty, you say?<eos> - Without a doubt.<eos> How can I help you gents? We're guests of Mr. Johnson.
We work hard to help you.<eos> Good, because my brother is innocent. 100 percent innocent.<eos> Now we gather information about Roars situation.<eos> We have also put together a group of crisis management psychologists.<eos> To help you through this difficult time.
You think?<eos> Oh. Richard sionis.<eos> James gordon.<eos> This is my partner, harvey bullock.<eos> How can I help you detectives?
- Yeah, I don't know.<eos> Now listen, I can... I can come up there tonight and talk to him.<eos> He'd get it.<eos> This is a win-win situation.<eos> Hi, what can I get for you two?
Please!<eos> Since you said the magic word.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Well, oily, oily, oxen free.<eos> - Can I help you gentlemen?
You swear to that.<eos> All right.<eos> Then I consider myself released.<eos> Goodbye, Mr Waring.<eos> Gentlemen, my assistants will give you all the literature you need about my new store.
You have the look of one.<eos> Actually, Henri is the best window display man in the world.<eos> And here we all are.<eos> How delightful.<eos> What can I offer you gentlemen?
Mr. E?<eos> Who is that?<eos> Your... decorator?<eos> Get Vincent now.<eos> Can I help you gentlemen?
Lieutenant General Hoyt Jackson, Army Navy Communications Intelligence Board.<eos> I think you know Ray Donovan from the embassy.<eos> Yes. We have met.<eos> Good to see you again, Miss Pierce.<eos> How can we help you gentlemen?
And what about Phinbar?<eos> I did not kill little Byrnes... casualties!<eos> You're a soldier, Corcoran.<eos> You know losses come for the greater good.<eos> I'm going to tell you gentlemen something that does not leave this room.
They bet he'd put together the right group of people to crack the code on the vaccine.<eos> They were just using the track to stay close to him.<eos> Working the long game.<eos> It still doesn't explain why they killed Norris.<eos> May I be of some assistance to you gentlemen?
Far out, man!<eos> If you want to keep that, I wouldn't.<eos> Make love, not war.<eos> I prefer to do both.<eos> How are you, officers? What can I do you for?
Identity theft.<eos> I see it happen all the time.<eos> I'm an accountant. Well, have you noticed any unauthorized activity on your accounts or credit card?<eos> No. I keep a close watch, and I have fraud alerts on everything.<eos> I can tell you right now exactly how much I have in my wallet right down to the dollar without even looking.
Who's that stumblin' around in the dark?<eos> State your business or prepare to get winged!<eos> Calm yourselves, gentlemen.<eos> I mean you no harm.
please tell mr. mendoza how much i appreciate this.<eos> no, it's, uh, mendoza brothers' gift to a friend.<eos> gracias.<eos> de nada.<eos> i can't describe to you what i didn't see.
Couldn't have been any later than ten minutes till.<eos> We ran a tox screen on Kevin.<eos> Turns out someone slipped him a roofie that night.<eos> Look, um... none of this matters now.<eos> It doesn't change anything that happened.. so I'll just tell you.
Someone got here before us.<eos> - Dunham. - Olivia, they know that you're there.<eos> - Dr. Owen Frank, please.<eos> - He's on the third floor.<eos> Here, let me show you.
Maybe she said something to someone that'll give us somewhere to dig.<eos> So you want to go talk to a hotel staff instead of her friends?<eos> You coming?<eos> Morning.<eos> How can I help you gentlemen?
There's an address there.<eos> Nice work. Go and get her, but be careful.<eos> If she executed D'Stefano in cold blood, she's likely to put up a fight.<eos> All right. We'll call in, we get anything.<eos> Can I, uh, help you gents?
I've full faith in our love.<eos> I beg you, buddy! Ensure this meeting goes well!<eos> They're here to invest Rs.2000 crores.<eos> If you mess up, we'll lose Rs.2000 crores, and have to return their advance of Rs.500 crores with interest. Don't I know this? I think you'll invest more after seeing our presentation.<eos> Don't get surprized! We know his passion of racing! He's symbolically telling you we'll finish the project like that.
Good to see you, missus.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Children, come along.<eos> What can I get for you?
I thought I might just have a bath.<eos> Bath in home?<eos> Message understood.<eos> Ok, you'll got it.<eos> Really... gentlemen! I'll never thanks you enough, I had no idea it was so big.
Stay in the car.<eos> Mm, mm.<eos> I know what you're thinking. First you get the bike, then you get a tattoo, next thing I know, you're driving to Sturgis, South Dakota.<eos> I don't know about the tattoo.<eos> What can I do for you two gentlemen?
That's three votes tarzan, one Vote chelsea.<eos> 13th person voted out and The seventh member of our jury, Tarzan.<eos> You need to bring me your torch.<eos> Tarzan, the tribe has spoken.<eos> I want to thank you ladies And you gentlemen for the Adventure and for allowing me to See my wife.
Me?<eos> Just keep sailing on.<eos> Interview terminated.<eos> Go on, piss off!<eos> Thank you, sir.
Something's very wrong here.<eos> This new currency hasn't been put into circulation yet.<eos> None of it has ever left our control. Or been outside a Treasury building.<eos> Over a decade of research and development went into the New Benjamin's security features.<eos> Let me show you.
Gentlemen.<eos> Thanks for coming out.<eos> Give me a few minutes to wash up. I'll be right with you.<eos> Stephanie will show you the way to the library.<eos> If you need anything, she'll be happy to get it for you, okay?
- Of course it does.<eos> Unusual shelf work back there-- Top shelf to bottom, nothing's level.<eos> My father built those-- '67, I think--<eos> Just before he went off to Vietnam.<eos> Let me show you the roof.
He keeps a lot of people employed.<eos> He has made you a rich man, hasn't he?<eos> You know what, gentlemen?<eos> This is a nonstarter.<eos> Now, I'm gonna let you go do your jobs, but under no circumstances am I calling off this fight.
There are few cheeses that get better as they age --<eos> There's your blues and your bries, but unfortunately, people are like shredded cheddar.<eos> The longer you leave them in the refrigerator, the more they start to stink.<eos> I have to run -- Customers.<eos> What can I do for you gentlemen?
These three businessmen wrote a check today to fund West Side Story in completion, and are now assured full-page ads in the program for the musical.<eos> I'm a big fan of the show, just because there are so many deaths in it.<eos> So, Will, unless I'm mistaken, I think this means the show is back on.<eos> Burt, I think you're right.<eos> Gentlemen, thank you so much.
We will pay ya though. Yeah.<eos> We just need a little more time.<eos> Well, thank you, gentlemen.<eos> Thank you for telling me that you are unable to pay what is owed.<eos> I shall give you a little more time, hmm?
Yes!<eos> No, you don't have to do that. It's okay.<eos> I miss my dolls.<eos> Not for long.<eos> Thank you, both of you.
Okay. I think that's all we need. Thank you.<eos> Ben knows where Tito is.<eos> Girlfriend's house. Great.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Can I help you, Officers?
- But I'm afraid we don't.<eos> - This is ridiculous.<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> - We are doing our goddamn job.<eos> Didn't McPherson tell you the good news?
And baseball is played on a diamond.<eos> Get it?<eos> So who was it that named you after the sandwich?<eos> Your mom or your dad?<eos> How can I be of service to you, officers?
It sort of seemed like they were in the middle of something.<eos> It's kind of weird for honeymooners to check out without this.<eos> CONCIERGE: Oh, dear.<eos> I'll just put that right in the lost and found. Don't you worry.<eos> Is there anything else I can help you with?
- Just get him in as soon as you can.<eos> - Sure.<eos> I'll call him right now.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm telling you, there's no way Preston could have hurt that girl.
We've got a few questions we'd like to ask him. Yeah. Um, come in.<eos> Oh, God. Honey, um, why don't you go play in your room for a little while, okay?<eos> Excuse the mess.<eos> Please sit.<eos> Can I get you guys anything?
Well, on our tax returns, it says we sell seashells by the seashore, but, uh, we moonlight a bit.<eos> Mr. Lindus wanted you to retrieve something for him, didn't he?<eos> Yeah, a sex tape.<eos> Him and Elenore knocking boots.<eos> And how much did Mr. Lindus pay you for the cell phone with the sex tape on it?
And how much did Mr. Lindus pay you for the cell phone with the sex tape on it?<eos> $30,000.<eos> He must have really, really wanted it back.<eos> Enough to kill someone, I guess.<eos> This is the check that he paid you with?
Because you're the ones who put him there.<eos> Your husband isn't, by any chance...<eos> Robert Lindus.<eos> I'm Josephine Lindus.<eos> He asked that I give this to you... said that you could keep it as long as you come see him in county.
Whitney keeps my calendar.<eos> Uh, April 19th.<eos> Oh, of course.<eos> I know exactly where I was.<eos> And I would be happy to tell you, providing you can get a warrant based on some bizarre connection you've made between me, an anonymous business card, and random questions about Russian art.
John, please join us.<eos> Gentlemen.<eos> Mr Dawson has his own dreams. Don't you, John?<eos> I do, Bill.<eos> I'm offering you a business opportunity, gentlemen.
Perhaps we'd gather them more discreetly?<eos> Everyone will know in minutes anyhow.<eos> Jackie, Patience, Mandy, the police want to talk to us about Scarlett's murder.<eos> Everybody, the silent auction closes shortly so get those bids in now, folks.<eos> I'll show you the way.
(ANDY speaking FRENCH)<eos> From the Wisconsin region, a nice, firm cheddar.<eos> Also from the great state of Wisconsin, an aged Parmesan.<eos> Here you will find a cheddar-style spread, which has reacted nicely with the air to form a light rind, which I think you'll find both challenging and delicious.<eos> At that point, I would recommend you take a quick trip south of the border to the great state of Illinois, where you will find this fine blue cheese dressing.
- "C" "H".<eos> - Maybe.<eos> What do you mean, maybe?<eos> That's a "C" and an "H".<eos> Can I help you, gentlemen?
I think that was very, very important in a sense of saying, "We have to try this, we have to do this."<eos> He would hold out for his idea of what Python should be.<eos> He'd say, "No, this isn't Python." Only Terry knew quite what that meant.<eos> But he would have a very strong, philosophical view of what Python meant.<eos> Morning, gentlemen. What can I do for you?
Oh, my God.<eos> How did it happen?<eos> Not very nicely, Krista.<eos> What did Lance Corporal Lozada guard around here?<eos> Um... I'll show you.
We swim-a in the pee, we sing-a in the pee.<eos> You can't barge in here and tell me that I have to close down just because my water park has-a too much pee.<eos> You have to evacuate people now!<eos> He said he's not doing it!<eos> And as his lawyer, I advise you gentlemen, to leave and take your wild pee theories with you.
No... no, you don't.<eos> - I'm going. - What? G-Gavin!<eos> Gavin, will you stop that!<eos> Excuse me?<eos> - Can I help you?
Mr. Compton?<eos> I'm Bud Dearborne.<eos> Sheriff of Renard Parish.<eos> This here's Detective Andy Bellefleur.<eos> What can I do for you gentlemen?
Hold what in?<eos> What do you think we're gonna do? I don't know.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Just hold it in. Hold it.<eos> Can we do anything for you gentlemen?
You know summerlin?<eos> Yeah. It's like 9 miles east of here.<eos> Off the 95.<eos> He was 10 minutes away and never let me know.<eos> Can i help you,gentlemen?
- What are you doing?<eos> - Do you want this up?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> Uh, may I help you gentlemen with something?
Good God, man!<eos> If you are not shocked, are you not at least surprised?<eos> Your master is dead and by his own hand.<eos> Sir, Mr Merdle never was quite the gentleman, and no ungentlemanly act on his part could surprise me.<eos> Is there anybody else I can send to you, sir, or any directions I can give before I leave?
Chemicals, like in science class.<eos> Yes.<eos> Who remembers this stuff!<eos> Hello.<eos> Well, can I help you fellas find anything!
A supreme commander.<eos> Second only to the Chancellor.<eos> If I were that man, this war would be going quite differently.<eos> Well, we were thinking the same thing.<eos> I don't need to remind you that we've all sworn an oath to the Führer.
I'm actually a little desperate.<eos> Best of luck.<eos> Drinks are on the gentleman.<eos> Have a nice day.<eos> You, too.
- So you don't know anything.<eos> My father left me a letter blaming this group for the way his life turned out.<eos> Every old Southern family has its share of, um, lunatics... in the back parlor... and illegitimate children in the shack down the road.<eos> That's not quite what I meant, and I think you know that.<eos> - Well, then thank you for dinner, gentlemen.

- Three-quarter mile from where they found Janet Butler.<eos> - Search warrant.<eos> Nice work.<eos> Wayne Callison, police. Open up.<eos> May I help you, gentlemen? - Mr. Callison, my name is Seba...
Just because we do things different than in the city doesn't mean it's wrong.<eos> Those outside laws. They don't apply to us.<eos> We're better off for it.<eos> And that's the way it's always been.<eos> Now, you two, you have a good afternoon.
Come in, please.<eos> - Sun block, anyone?<eos> - Yes. Thank you, Auntie.<eos> Sure.<eos> Now, I am going to bring you boys a little treat.
I got you, you son of a bitch.<eos> We got him, let's go bring him in.<eos> Hey, Walter.<eos> Come on in.<eos> How can I help you gentlemen?
I have controls.<eos> Stand by.<eos> 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.<eos> Execute. Execute.<eos> Thank you, men.
Long conference call.<eos> About an hour so far by my watch.<eos> Got me out here riding the wood.<eos> Unfortunately the governor's phone call has gone longer than anticipated.<eos> Can I get you anything? Coffee?
-Why not? Why shouldn't someone like me settle down with a wife and kids?<eos> Boy, I don't know where to start.<eos> That's the old Charlie you're thinking of.<eos> Oh, okay. And to whom am I speaking now?<eos> -May I help you gentlemen?
I was just-- nah, you're the big hero.<eos> You sure took care of those 2 bad men.<eos> I really don't like talking about it, sir.<eos> We're trying to get back to normal here.<eos> So, can I offer you gentlemen some coffee?
I'll call you when Charlie wants to see you.<eos> Private room.<eos> Not too shabby.<eos> You must have 99 lives.<eos> What can I do for you gentlemen?
What?<eos> Last night we found out it wasn't random. The witness was paid, and the whole gang story was some bullshit.<eos> Are you serious, man?<eos> Come on, now. Yeah.<eos> Can I help you, gentlemen?
Let's close these deals !<eos> I got a room full of pikers or closers ?<eos> My grandmother used to say if it sounds too good to be true, it is.<eos> Only closers go on that board.<eos> Can I help you gentlemen ?
Brenda.<eos> What a surprise.<eos> Well, the ladies' room never has any toilet paper ever.<eos> Hey, Will.<eos> Thank you, sir.
Gosh, I'm sorry.<eos> The craftsman who makes these chests keeps a list of customers.<eos> Apparently, you purchased one in August 1992.<eos> We'd like to know where that chest is now.<eos> Wow, I wish I could help you. I don't recall any toy chest.
Yo, what up with these fools?<eos> Hey!<eos> Fore, jackasses!<eos> You believe this?<eos> Can I help you gentlemen?
what's this?<eos> that's for the urn.<eos> don't need it. we're scattering the ashes.<eos> yes, so we were informed.<eos> however, we must, of course, transmit the remains to you in a receptacle.
We're doin' little voices undercover.<eos> All right.<eos> OK. That's a sweet little pucker.<eos> I love it. - Hi.<eos> Can I get you two a drink? - You sure can.
Sure, on account of the weather, the... in space I mean, the electrical activity brought on by solar storms. It's attracted to our power grids, so...<eos> And how is it going to cause an explosion in underground cables, resulting in a blackout?<eos> Well...<eos> I'm not...<eos> Can I help you gentlemen?
He's coming along.<eos> - Could he be ready?<eos> - For what?<eos> Come on. You know what.<eos> Top of the mornin' to you.
That guy's a charmer.<eos> Yeah, real Ricky Roma.<eos> Do you want a treat?<eos> Do you want a treat?<eos> (yips) May I help you, gentlemen?
You withheld information from the coroner's court?<eos> A man of science shrinks from seeming to endorse a popular superstition.<eos> What superstition?<eos> This is an account of a certain legend that runs in the Baskerville family.<eos> With your permission, I'll read it to you.
If you're self-conscious I can doodle in chest hairs where you'd stand.<eos> I have a chest hair.<eos> I named him Clancy.<eos> - And then it happened.<eos> - Can I help you, sir?
You're gonna miss me, right?<eos> Do you even have to ask?<eos> Just promise me Saturday night's gonna be great.<eos> It'll be a night you won't forget.<eos> I appreciate you coming.
- In my office? - Yeah. They're in your office with Mr. Allsworth.<eos> - Who are they?<eos> - I have no idea.<eos> - Oh, shit. - Mr. Chase?<eos> - Can I get you more coffee? No? A bagel or...
How about we start in the bedroom?<eos> - The bedroom.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Right.<eos> I'll show you.
We practically solved half these cases for him.<eos> Yeah, Byers, quit your whining.<eos> Scully asked us to give our assistance, not to go through her... files.<eos> - Like she's gonna care! - Yeah, right.<eos> Can I help you gentlemen?
I'm sorry. Things are running a little bit late.<eos> Here's the, uh, thing.<eos> Do you wanna come this way ?<eos> Through here.<eos> So what did you think of the film ?
They weren't made for hot coffee.<eos> I wonder where our German comrades made their mistake.<eos> There were shooting in the air during the war.<eos> You two were made for each other, right?<eos> Anything not from the USA isn't good enough for you.
I hope this one goes a little smoother.<eos> There's no need to be insulting.<eos> It's all right, Doctor.<eos> I believe he is merely engaging in small talk.<eos> May I get either of you gentlemen a drink?
In the office, sleeping.<eos> Good evening, gentlemen.<eos> Mr. Hall has been unavoidably detained.<eos> He may be a trifle late.<eos> May I buy you a drink?
But we are here and there is a room with a bed and fire.<eos> Now this gentleman is a Duke.<eos> He asked for you particularly and he was told by your theatre manager you would comply.<eos> He will pay to be in the room with us while we play.<eos> - Then you were given the wrong name.
What are you... what is it?<eos> I have to apologize for not telling you everything.<eos> Hannah asked me to keep secrets for her.<eos> I wanted to honor that.<eos> But I've come to believe I need to share something with you.
I mean, come on, what are you gonna do?<eos> Narrate your own book?<eos> Yes, that's exactly what I intend to do.<eos> I'll narrate it and then have the audiobook reissued.<eos> Good morning, you two.

Or end it.<eos> I can't wait to see Boyd's face.<eos> We don't rate an appearance by Mr. Boyd?<eos> Mr. Boyd is confident his presence isn't required.<eos> I've been instructed by my client to tell you that Spartan-Ives is willing to pay a small fine, but that there will be no admission of guilt by Mr. Boyd personally and, of course, no termination.
A Romanian woman and her child were forced to leave the lifeboat to make room.<eos> Over here, you can imagine Sir Aldridge entertaining his wealthy guests.<eos> It's said that, in this very room, P.T. Barnum first had the idea to enslave elephants.<eos> And if you'll follow me...<eos> Now, I'm gonna tell you something a little spooky.
One of the most important things to keep in mind is that sexual energy can be... Altered and diverted.<eos> Sexual energy can be altered and diverted.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I had a great talk with my dad last night.<eos> That and, uh... Recent events in my life, which we don't have time for, have led me to say... What I'm about to say to you.
I'm sorry.<eos> Well, you got him here.<eos> - Cheers, mate.<eos> Bienvenue.<eos> Let me show you to your rooms.
Oh, shit.<eos> Welcome to Glasgow International Airport.<eos> Outside temperatures 18 degrees Celsius.<eos> Local time is 15 hours.<eos> There will be an airline representative to assist you to your luggage.
Your wife changed her mind.<eos> You mean about the earrings.<eos> No, no, no, I was trying to sell her a breach.<eos> I do have some beautiful earrings.<eos> I can offer you a very good price.
That's what I choose to believe.<eos> Only small thinkers believe there's a top.<eos> A plateau to reach.<eos> We here a Hubert national bank will never stop climbing higher to maximize your bottom line.<eos> I give you my personal guarantee as president of this bank that like my friend the spider here, I will devour any little bugs that get in our way.
- CUSTOMER: What the hell's going on?<eos> - Andrew Birch.<eos> I must apologise for my friend's misbehaviour.<eos> I think you bloody well should.<eos> Allow me to buy you lunch.
That's all he'll say.<eos> Okay. Unfortunately, uh, my associate tells me I'm needed for some brief but pressing legal business.<eos> I just need to make one quick phone call.<eos> Uh, in the meantime, who was it who wanted coffee?<eos> Yeah, okay, uh, this young lady will get you coffee... and, also, doughnuts if there are any left.
It seems your research deals primarily with genetic manipulation.<eos> Let me try to explain to you what we do here.<eos> It's no secret.<eos> We're trying to save children.<eos> I won't tell you their last names, to protect their privacy, but I can tell you what they are fighting against--
She's good, isn't she?<eos> - What're you doing here?<eos> - As for the investigation...<eos> First Lady wanted some support.<eos> ...the FBI director of counterterrorism will give you a full briefing. But...
Ma'am.<eos> -Hello.<eos> Welcome to The Anchor.<eos> I'm Gretchen and I will be your server.<eos> Can I get you something to drink?
Uh, you two, talk, get to know each other.<eos> Thank you so much for coming. I really...<eos> Look, I'm not making any promises.<eos> I rep a lot of writers, and I only sign ones I believe in... or who can make me a lot of money.<eos> Before I begin, I just wanted to tell you a little bit about why I wrote this book.
These were found at the scene of the crime.<eos> Oh, gosh, they were supporters.<eos> That makes this tragedy - even worse.<eos> - Yes, this doubles it.<eos> Can I offer you some breads?
Thank you.<eos> So, in memory of my late wife, I have given $1 million to help build the Elizabeth Rhodes Psychiatric Ward.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you you all very much.
so we'd appreciate it if you'd step aside so we can escort Mr. Nunez out of here.<eos> This is crazy, and it'll never stand up.<eos> Of course it will.<eos> Get him out of here.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, the New York Police Department would like to thank you for your cooperation, and Buenas noches.
We were hoping we could ask you a few questions?<eos> Actually, Mr. Trager was just leaving for an important meeting.<eos> It can't be rescheduled.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> But I've asked Josh and Bill to help you in any way they can.
Am I right in thinking you have never seen a locomotive, sir?<eos> That's correct.<eos> Well, there is presently one on my property at Drayton.<eos> It is quite adjacent.<eos> It would be my pleasure to offer you all a demonstration.
Nothing epic though, life is still a drag, nobody speaks to you at school and the teachers are still the same old assholes.<eos> - Jenny for me.<eos> - Jenny?<eos> - Two Texans.<eos> - I'll give you a minute.
She'll need the care until she gets better, until she wakes up and she can leave the hospital.<eos> Do we know when that might be?<eos> When Tess could leave here?<eos> Eventually, she would be moved to a long-term acute care facility where she would live for the rest of her...<eos> Well, we can... we can get you some brochures if that's what you decide.
Then, they are going to deposit large amounts of cash into my account.<eos> Powerful Koreans...<eos> Hello, hello. Yes, hello.<eos> Hello, I came to ask about our room service.<eos> Did you enjoy your meal?
My gut.<eos> You don't last as long as I have without listening to it.<eos> Hetty, I'm sure we would have heard by now if something was wrong.<eos> Just humor me.<eos> If I'm wrong, I'll buy you both...
A man claiming to be an envoy of the empire requests an audience.<eos> The envoy from Niflheim awaits without, Your Majesty.<eos> Hello there.<eos> Hello!<eos> Good day to you and you.
And when she turns 70...<eos> Look out,<eos> Sally is gonna peak in her 70s. Mm-hmm.<eos> - I promise you. - Yeah...<eos> - Can I interest you in dessert?
No, that's not true.<eos> Furthermore, is it not also true that on the night in question, I told you as tactfully as I was able that I wished our affair to end?<eos> You were saddened by this information and that I tarried at your side to proffer you some comfort.<eos> Her silence is eloquent, is it not?<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, what other plausible explanation can there be for the fact that the witness, by her own admission, spent over three hours, half the night, with me, a total stranger she would have you believe, in a field.
- Yes.<eos> So, how are you today?<eos> - Can I have some water?<eos> - Absolutely.<eos> I know sometimes the cameras can be a little off-putting, but their only purpose is our purpose, to provide you with the best care that we can.
I want you to know just how excited we all are to finally meet you.<eos> Well... it's a pleasure to be here.<eos> Your host invites you both to rest, relax, and join him for drinks at 4:00.<eos> - Tell our host we won't be late. - Wonderful.<eos> Before we show you to your rooms, just one more thing.
This is my wife, Nancy.<eos> And we're house sitting.<eos> Bill didn't say anything to us about this.<eos> Well, let me ask you.<eos> Have you... seen or heard anything out of the ordinary, anything you might deem suspicious?
[They're not hopeless.]<eos> [I'll never give up hope...] [of being free again.]<eos> Ross Ulbricht went on trial today.<eos> A jury will decide a case that could impact - the future of Internet privacy.<eos> - Good evening to you.
And this one "stayputnik."<eos> Meanwhile, as the Russian dog Laika becomes the first canine in space,<eos> Eisenhower vows that the U.S. will put men into orbit.<eos> But who, how, and when?<eos> Today, we are introducing to you and to the world these seven men, who have been selected to begin training for orbital space flight.
- Good to see you.<eos> Sorry we're late. - Yeah, you are.<eos> Nice to see you're so punctual.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Can I get you some drinks?
There is something afoot at the inn.<eos> I believe I know what it is.<eos> And I believe you'll want to know it, too.<eos> Next item!<eos> I know my role here is to recount information to you.
My wife and I went through the same thing.<eos> You know Cheryl, down in animal control. Yes!<eos> This is her method.<eos> Well, listen, you folks obviously have some business to get to.<eos> I'm going to run some traffic control so no one disturbs you.
Okay, so this conversation will then become an illuminating essay of two thousand words.<eos> Get to it.<eos> So, I have got perfect nickels, I've never done these before, okay?<eos> At $29.95, basically the cost of certification.<eos> And I'm gonna give you the opportunity...
What are you all looking at? Backstage.<eos> Places! Places! This is a run-through!<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, prepare yourselves to witness the death-defying feat first performed by the great Torrini for Pope Pius VII.<eos> Originally called The Magic Saw.<eos> Tonight I will be presenting it to you with my own... dangerous variation.
Thanks.<eos> That's good to know.<eos> Table eight.<eos> Hey. Welcome to Patsy's.<eos> I'll give you a second.
Six months ago, you dreamed of an evening like this.<eos> You think so?<eos> Then you're misinformed.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Let me give you an example.
Uh, thank you for coming all this way.<eos> Um, I'm grateful for the diversion program, that it gives nurses like me a second chance.<eos> I love being a nurse more than anything.<eos> It's who I am. And I love helping people.<eos> Um, I hope today will prove that to you.
Try something faster.<eos> Until I can guarantee their security, this is the best plan.<eos> Ma'am, security is my job.<eos> We're on 24 hour lockdown here.<eos> I am assuring you... the assets are secure.
My wife, Roxanne, and I would like a hotel room for, um... for, uh,<eos> - We can do that.<eos> - Great.<eos> I'll let you sign.<eos> I'm gonna give you the corner room.
Good god.<eos> It's called the velvet whip.<eos> I was there all night.<eos> There must have been a dozen witnesses.<eos> Why don't i give you a minute?
Easy?<eos> Yeah, you got off easy.<eos> What about the family business?<eos> It took me 30 years to build it.<eos> You and that band of idiots, took you 10 minutes to tear it down.
- I don't believe we've met.<eos> I said, that's enough!<eos> You're out of line.<eos> We'll talk about this later.<eos> Perhaps it's best, I give you time to think it over.
- Good for you.<eos> Last month, a boy's bones were found up on the hill above Wonderland.<eos> He was murdered and buried there 20 years ago.<eos> His name was Arthur Delacroix.<eos> Does that name mean anything to either of you? No.
Come on.<eos> What else is there to do in here?<eos> And what happened to your reporter skills?<eos> If this was a story, no way in hell the old April Carter would have dropped it.<eos> To give you some perspective on this potentially historic storm.
It is null and void.<eos> So, effectively, Mr. Hendricks never had a valid employment agreement with Hooli.<eos> As a result, Hooli has no claim to ownership of Pied Piper's underlying IP.<eos> That is my ruling and per your arbitration agreement, it is binding and final.<eos> Thank you, everyone.
Attention, residents!<eos> This is the police!<eos> Please stay in your homes. Keep your doors closed.<eos> Don't let anyone in!<eos> We will inform you once the situation is under control.
Any word yet?<eos> PEN/Faulkner?<eos> You'd be the first to know. You know what you're reading tonight?<eos> No, you have a favorite?<eos> I love the shower scene. So without further ado, it is our great pleasure to introduce to you author Noah Solloway.
I haven't heard a legal basis for any of this.<eos> I'll be making a formal complaint to your commanding officer.<eos> You can make it in person, Mrs Hawkins.<eos> He's on his way.<eos> Your property will be returned to you.
You did the right thing.<eos> Mr. Von Muhlberg's been searched.<eos> He's clean.<eos> We had to let him go.<eos> He says he was reaching for his briefcase to show you a picture of his son.
What?<eos> No.<eos> If he hurt you, we can get you out of here.<eos> I promise.<eos> Hey, can I help you with something?
Mr. Brown.<eos> It's a very good likeness, yes.<eos> A bit flattering in the cheekbones but it's good.<eos> Our receptionist said there were two people here to look at a painting of me.<eos> Can I help you with something? Oh, no.
Then forget the slogan and listen to this.<eos> You have a wonderful marriage and with my parents, I should know.<eos> Don't spoil it now by asking her to choose.<eos> Please.<eos> .. Using this hospital that has served you so well and for so long.
Oliphant vs. Suquamish, 1978, stripped the tribe of its rights to arrest and prosecute non-Indians.<eos> I guess you was scared we would, uh, scalp you if we got some power.<eos> But you did get power.<eos> Not the right power, Walter.<eos> See, when a white man hands you a law, you have to pay attention to the loopholes.
You have the address. They're waiting for you.<eos> He's got everything he needs.<eos> - Put it into Mr Brent's hands.<eos> - Yes, ma'am.<eos> - I'll get you some more coffee.
And Sybbie, darling!<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> And how did you know where to find us?<eos> The hall boy on duty told me where you were.<eos> It means that I can congratulate you in person.
Carolyn.<eos> Sophie shoved one of those girls into a locker. She needed a dozen stitches to the back of her head.<eos> After being bullied by her repeatedly,<eos> Or does that not matter since her father Owns half the peninsula and donates a shitload?<eos> I'll give you some time.
The thing that you use to measure.<eos> This? A ruler?<eos> Yes. That's it.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I wanted to thank you all for coming.
I'm not going to marry anyone else. Not until after you've broken my heart, anyway.<eos> I'll go.<eos> Kiss me first.<eos> And I promise I won't keep you waiting too long.<eos> All right, let's see what you make of that.
Our city has seen incredible... impossible things:<eos> meta-humans... men and women... with extraordinary abilities:<eos> the ability to soar above buildings, to run faster than the speed of light.<eos> Unfortunately, most of these meta-humans have chosen the wrong path with these powers, a dark path.<eos> My team and I at S.T.A.R. Labs are committed to keeping up with these perilous times, and so may I present to you our new line of meta-human awareness apps?
What's wrong? Well, I'm not seeing one baby, let alone two.<eos> And you're absolutely sure?<eos> I'm not hearing any heartbeats either.<eos> I'm sorry if you were informed otherwise.<eos> I'll give you some time alone.
MAN: And boring.<eos> Unless they're all sleeping together.<eos> That's very Washington.<eos> Not in this office.<eos> So I gave you a rough outline of what we're hoping to achieve in the e-mail I sent.
Perhaps he's right.<eos> Are you ready, Mr. Twain?<eos> I certainly am.<eos> Keep your eyes open, George.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, it is my great honour to introduce to you one of America's finest men of letters.
Okay, I'll meet some of the candidates. But...<eos> I am making no promises.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Can I help you find something?
He was the last man standing between the Junction and prohibition.<eos> The scourge of liquor is a terrible thing.<eos> It turns homes into hovels.<eos> We must stand up to this scourge, for temperance is the will of the Lord himself.<eos> - Hallelujah! - It pleases me very much to introduce to you a special guest.
Not if we have back-up.<eos> Bonjour.<eos> Enchantée.<eos> You must be Anna.<eos> I take it Jack Witkowski paid you a visit.
Forgive me if I don't make eye contact.<eos> - I've seen you in action.<eos> - Why are you doing this?<eos> My dear, the simple truth is, I need you to heal me.<eos> Testing you with the animals was misguided, but earth-magicking the cement and shattering Rose's ankle was supremely clarifying.
And last but not least, to Susan "The Steamroller" Purtree for putting this all together.<eos> And now, finally, at long last, as some of you may be saying, it is my honor, my privilege, my personal pleasure to present to you the man of every hour, University of Perth's own Professor Edgar Solomon.
Those buns are all still good.<eos> Just change the hats. Yeah.<eos> Yeah, that's what I thought.<eos> I'm calling the police.<eos> Uh, just thought you should know that the meat here is real shitty.
Together...<eos> Raul, see.<eos> I'll go and talk to the sheriff.<eos> See you in a bit.<eos> Good day to you.
I'll have the whole valley bought up in a week if you let me do things my way.<eos> Just answer the question.<eos> You keep your cavalry out of the equation, I recon it'll take 3 to 4 months.<eos> That's all I needed to know.<eos> Good day to you.
Well, not a hundred percent.<eos> But in real life, we don't trouble ourselves with mere possibilities.<eos> We know that some things are so unlikely, we can safely dismiss them.<eos> Well, the law takes exactly the same attitude.<eos> In the course of this trial, the defence will offer you an account of what happened to Steven Blakely.
- We were scared of this.<eos> - This home is owned by the bank.<eos> - This is the information that we have.<eos> - And we're sorry to waste your time.<eos> My office offered you a $3500 cash-or-keys settlement from the bank which would have given you time to vacate the premises and you refused. - Yes, sir.
The house still belongs to us and we intend to keep it that way.<eos> I hope that works out.<eos> God forbid it doesn't.<eos> If you got a second I wanna tell you about cash for keys, here on the form.<eos> What do you mean, cash for keys? If you leave your house in a broom-swept condition prior to your eviction date, banks can give you 3500 bucks cash in your pocket.
We're going to have to wait till he calls back.<eos> We can't leave today.<eos> - I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.<eos> - We're not ready for this.<eos> What I can do is give you some time to go into the house, grab all the stuff you need, whether it's medicine, stuff for your baby, jewellery, any pictures, anything valuable.
You're all trespassing.<eos> All of you, get off of my property.<eos> No, sir, you and your wife are trespassing.<eos> This is the property of the bank now.<eos> We're giving you an opportunity to collect some of your belongings.
The house isn't yours anymore.<eos> Easy now.<eos> Anyone know what to do about a bird?<eos> 3500.<eos> I'm giving you the better option.
There's a moment where you ran your fingers through his hair.<eos> It's intimate.<eos> Human.<eos> That moment alone would've made me want to vote for your husband.<eos> Something like that will buy you months of flying beneath the radar.
Let's not talk about it.<eos> These are Julia and Larry.<eos> You saw Louise?<eos> Julia is here.<eos> I want to present to you.
Oh, well, that's better.<eos> We just have to kill all your children.<eos> (exclaims) Or just one of them.<eos> If you can figure out which one sired the killer rabbits.<eos> (rattling) We interrupt this hologram to bring you an important bulletin.
- I don't understand why you're fighting me on this when she bothers me...<eos> We're pulling up to Frank's in two minutes.<eos> Really superb, Freddy.<eos> I can honestly say I have never had better ribs in my life.<eos> Well, I'm glad you liked 'em.
Sir, Riley Neal, Cyber Com.<eos> This is señor Javier León.<eos> Señor León, I'm Jim Sutters.<eos> I'm the undersecretary of state in charge of South American affairs.<eos> Mr. undersecretary of state, allow me to introduce to you my wife, Marcela.
She wants what's in my closet.<eos> She looks up to my kid, not the other way around.<eos> Thank you for the latte.<eos> Really hit the spot.<eos> We'll give you a moment.
- You think Will is innocent.<eos> - I don't know what I think.<eos> I think he still wants to save lives. That's what I think.<eos> Mr. Graham, it's time.<eos> Let me tell you the story of a mild-mannered FBI instructor who was asked to create a psychological profile of a murderer -
Seven hours after the foiled bombing, officials finally reopened the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium.<eos> Police and federal officials cleared the building and assured everyone that it was safe to reenter.<eos> But the real story here was one of perseverance for the thousands who came to be naturalized as American citizens...<eos> Undeterred by the terrifying events of the day, they moved back inside and took the oath of allegiance.<eos> And I can tell you from personally meeting some of these new citizens, they could not be happier or more proud.
Congratulations, Miss Odom.<eos> You've just been promoted from laundress to surgical nurse.<eos> - Good night, Miss Cummins.<eos> - Good night, sir.<eos> Doctors, good evening to you.
There's been a very interesting development in the case.<eos> I'm gonna need you all to pay very careful attention.<eos> Agent Fischer, if you would.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Now, does this song mean something to any of you?
You -- I can get a subpoena, if I have to.<eos> That won't be necessary.<eos> I was merely gonna counsel you to...exercise discretion here, for your own sake.<eos> Our members are, um... powerful people.<eos> You can see our concierge, Peter Kilgallen, and he'll give you the information you need.
We go by my rules.<eos> If it was Burke Fit, we'd be following your rules.<eos> We'd probably all be doing bicep curls with wine glasses.<eos> See, now, I'd sign up for that class.<eos> Pardon me, it is my great pleasure to present to you Chef Malcolm Sunderland.
- No.<eos> - Then you're innocent.<eos> So why do I feel so nervous?<eos> You all right?<eos> Now, let me tell you exactly what the defense is going to say.
Now, let me tell you exactly what the defense is going to say.<eos> That the DNA can't be trusted.<eos> Mr. Gardner's gonna pound his desk and say loudly, so that you know that it's important,<eos> "Garbage in, garbage out."<eos> Well, I'm glad Mr. Polmar gave you a preview of my defense, it'll save me time.
Press will want to lump it in with all the others.<eos> Well, Cameron's operating system is unlike anything else on the market.<eos> Cameron?<eos> Uh, yeah, it's interactive.<eos> Um, I can just show it to you.
Can I take your order?<eos> Yes, please. Um...<eos> I haven't even looked at the menu yet.<eos> Do you have someplace else to go?<eos> I'll give you another minute.
Jake here?<eos> We have a warrant.<eos> Which is a really good thing, because I am all flirted out.<eos> He's in the kitchen.<eos> How can I help you, Detectives?
Funny you don't remember him.<eos> You're the last one he called before he died.<eos> Joanne: I hope you don't mind answering a few questions, mr.<eos> Delgros.<eos> Not at all. I hope you don't mind.
Oh, right, sorry.<eos> I forgot we're not in my office.<eos> Um, how about the kitchen? Or the hall?<eos> Whichever's more comfortable for you.<eos> So, um... I'm hearing that Whitney's observations are not ringing true to you?
Yeah, I changed my mind.<eos> - You're both gonna cry. - (laughs)<eos> I'll take table eight.<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> Can I get you something to drink?
Ooh.<eos> [French accent] Excuse me.<eos> It seems to me as if you might need some assistance.<eos> Yes?<eos> Okay, so that's six cases of albariño, 12 of the neuf-du-pape, and next time I'm in Reims, I'm sending you a box of those chocolates.
She did say she was going to - take some time off from her internship.<eos> - Do you know why?<eos> Her mother's death was recent.<eos> Whitney said she needed some time to get over the loss.<eos> Does the word "Diamondback" mean anything to either of you?
of Margaret and Donald Jr.<eos> - Are they local?<eos> - Bethesda.<eos> Let's bring them in.<eos> Mr. and Mrs. Morgan, thank you for coming in.
Listen.<eos> This is our chance to finally finish what we started.<eos> Come on, man, it'll be fucking mental!<eos> I think we're all done. So...<eos> How do you like the property?
You might feel a bit of a vacuum.<eos> Oh. Wait a second.<eos> Oh, merde.<eos> Thank you, Etienne.<eos> Thank you, everyone!
I love my fucking job.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, I am Dr. Robert Morris, the chief of staff here at All Saints.<eos> And on behalf of the administration, I want to welcome you, and let you know that we consider our nursing staff to be the backbone of this hospital.<eos> You are our angels of mercy.<eos> And now I would like to introduce to you the real person in charge here.
whose genius wowed Godureaux himself.<eos> The one and only Tom Selznick.<eos> I almost forgot!<eos> I'm sorry, Tom, I'll get back to you in a second.<eos> As if this venue weren't unique enough, let me tell you something about the piano that Tom is playing.
Are you having fun ?<eos> I have to call back later , We 'll talk tomorrow.<eos> - Well , have fun not too good without me.<eos> - Goodbye.<eos> Good morning to you .
He left under something of a cloud.<eos> There are very big marlin to be caught out in Kenya, I hear.<eos> Uh, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I'd like to thank Colonel Hillingdon, who I'm sure is here somewhere, for arranging what promises to be a most unusual and interesting evening.<eos> So, without further ado, allow me to introduce tonight's speaker - author of Birds of the West Indies - Mr James Bond.<eos> Uh, t-t-thank you.
- Look out!<eos> Be safe!<eos> Don't do what I just did!<eos> Hey, officers, you guys want to stick around and have a drink with me, hang out a little bit?<eos> You're afraid of us leaving you alone with your son, aren't you?
You have no evidence to support your claims.<eos> Why tear this family apart?<eos> So, how about that guacamole?<eos> We make it right here at the table.<eos> I'll just give you guys a few more minutes.
The Sonnenlands are ready to talk.<eos> AL: We're not accusing you, sir.<eos> Well, I'd appreciate you modulating your tone.<eos> My wife and I are in no mood to be harassed.<eos> Mr. Sonnenland, the last thing we want to do is make this any more difficult for you.
It's possible that so much negative energy...<eos> It's got nothing _to do with people envying us.<eos> My poor little girl.<eos> This is Shinjuku station's west exit area.<eos> It's an honour presenting the Shinjuku Spiral Tower to you.
It's good to have water in the SW direction.<eos> Mrs. Ye, you are so smart.<eos> The water here is from the Western Regions.<eos> I know you're looking for a big house.<eos> No problem, I am gonna explain it to you.
Who's going to see it?<eos> - The keys, sir. - Oh.<eos> - Anything else, sir? - Non, non.<eos> Merci, ca va.<eos> Do you want me to show you the room?
Give me strength.<eos> I'm sure this is going to look a lot more dainty.<eos> Good evening, gentlemen.<eos> My findings, developed, processed, distilled,<eos> I've saved you the trouble of running them off in case the copy machine's broken.
It fairly reeks of sex.<eos> Well, we liken early sobriety to a whack-a-mole game.<eos> You push down one addiction, and another one pops up.<eos> And even though we have a strict policy about it, newly sober people tend to act out sexually.<eos> But I can't tell you who Charlie was sleeping with.
That's my pride and joy.<eos> Won it in Augusta in '02.<eos> You eagled for the win.<eos> That's right.<eos> Can I get either of you two a drink?
Your father must've been a very tall man.<eos> Don't pretend like you knew Daddy.<eos> Oh, no, of course not.<eos> Um, please follow me.<eos> I would love to show you the facility.
Can we see the outside?<eos> Of course.<eos> It sits on over an acre of grass.<eos> Again, a lot of upkeep.<eos> Are you sure I can't show you something a little further down the hill?
You'll just do it?<eos> Sure.<eos> You're gonna wear me down eventually.<eos> I might as well just give in now.<eos> This joke brought to you by marriage.
So I'm gonna hand it over to the real expert here, Marty Kaan. MARTY:<eos> Thank you, Carl. Thank you so much. Um...<eos> "Opportunity"-- that... that's a perfect word for it.<eos> So let me speak to you a second about opportunity, opportunity and Carl Criswell.<eos> I happen to have the great pleasure of counting myself among Carl's friends, and let me tell you that this is a man who is not only a great leader and a... a brilliant CEO, but he is also someone who has his finger
Would love to come there. I am on a two-week birthday-party cleanse.<eos> I coulda been a consigliere.<eos> It'll be me and 97 friends.<eos> This RSV has been peed.<eos> Thank you. I'm Thor83.
Your desk is right over there.<eos> Remember, always recommend our restaurant before suggesting anywhere else.<eos> - We're hosting an event for the Association of Aviation Technology tomorrow, and most of the attendees are arriving today, so... no excuse for standing around.<eos> Are you waiting for a written invitation?<eos> Let me help you with that.
Of course.<eos> It's hit him quite hard.<eos> Like all of us.<eos> We're like a little family here.<eos> I'll show you the way.
Waldo, Waldo.<eos> Do you think Lisa went to that jazz club I wouldn't take her to?<eos> How many kids will jazz corrupt?<eos> Lap pool and fully-quipped gym with eucalyptus towels.<eos> Now, let me give you the 14 different apartment configurations.
No.<eos> Are you Randall and Lisa Flynn, parents of sergeant Edward Flynn, stationed at Bagram Air Base?<eos> Yes.<eos> Mr. and Mrs. Flynn, the Secretary of the Army has asked me to express his deep regret that your son Edward was killed in action in Kabul, Afghanistan.<eos> The secretary extends his deepest sympathy to you and your family.
Take care, Harris.<eos> You're not going anywhere.<eos> Mother?<eos> Now, this whole side of the platform has gone under a massive retrofit over the last three months, so everything's up to speed.<eos> Let me take you right here. I'll show you the control room.
The contrast between the two is alarming.<eos> If you please?<eos> Behold!<eos> Behold, alternating current.<eos> I send you away now, ladies and gentlemen, to ponder only this...
Good evening, Miss Cobden.<eos> Mr Broadwick.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen. I could, of course, wish you welcome to the future but, whilst this most certainly is the future I am to show you, I would not do so with fireworks.<eos> Although such things are certainly within my gift.<eos> I will show you.
- But this is a special soup called pho.<eos> You told me not to say that word.<eos> It is delicious.<eos> This is the food of your people.<eos> Can I get you anything else?
I like your head... hair. I like your...<eos> I like the hair on your head.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Welcome to Vouloir.<eos> I'll give you a minute to acquaint yourselves with the menus and the wine list.
Carlyle.<eos> Chauncey's ready for his walk.<eos> Thank you, Miss Bea.<eos> There's a reading of Franny and Zooey at the 92nd Street Y.<eos> I managed to secure you two tickets.
And you're absolutely sure?<eos> Twins would be hard to miss.<eos> I'm not hearing any heartbeats either.<eos> I'm sorry if you were informed otherwise.<eos> I'll give you some time alone.
Oh, well, then congratulations are certainly in order.<eos> The judge would be proud.<eos> Well, thank you, Jackie.<eos> That means the world.<eos> Yes, well, I'll let you two get back to your meeting.
Don't worry.<eos> I'll find him.<eos> My feeling is there's really no need to press for an excavation of the boat.<eos> Self-combustion is a common risk when you ship construction materials.<eos> I'm sure we can find a way to compensate you for this tragic event.
You get the same food we get.<eos> Bed and shelter?<eos> You get the same shelter we get.<eos> And for sporting facilities...<eos> May I introduce you to the beautiful Norwegian countryside!
You would do that?<eos> Yes.<eos> I would hate to put you and your husband through that.<eos> But, as I said to Ms. Danville, i am not asking to let him go.<eos> But if fifteen years puts him away and saves you a trial...
What's the latest on the flight recorder from Charles Flyte's plane, Prime Minister?<eos> It hasn't been found.<eos> Surely there's something to report.<eos> It's been three weeks now.<eos> If there was something to tell, I would tell you.
We are going to spark a whole new industrial revolution.<eos> Maglev trains, hover cars, cheap, easy energy.<eos> Allison, I take back everything I said about Jack.<eos> He's a genius.<eos> Well, not exactly. I ran my test on the Alpha GPC-booster that Kevin dosed you with.
Right.<eos> Well done, everyone.<eos> Very well done.<eos> Now...<eos> I'm gonna give you a moment, all, to compose yourselves while we prepare for the next round.
There's nothing wrong with these uniforms that a few denim patches won't fix.<eos> Oh, all right.<eos> To the garment district.<eos> Come in, come in.<eos> Can I offer you maybe a nice macaroon cut in seven pieces?
fixation of Species, kg / ha:<eos> 17-4.5 in alfalfa 125 red clover, soybean 70, beans 50.<eos> There fertilizers organic nitrogenous specific like dried blood, a meat meal, bagasse, etc..<eos> Do not run the risk of over-fertilization of P and K. However, its prohibitive price does not permit use in field crops no growth.<eos> Thank you.
Chocolates on the calendar.<eos> Last-minute shopping on the internet.<eos> Little boys and girls looking out of the window, wondering if Santa's going to bring them that toy they've been wanting all year round.<eos> So now, without further ado... Bring it up, bring it up.<eos> ...I would like to introduce to you Shane and the Calendar Girls singing Counting Down For Christmas. You can keep your peace on Earth.
Good.<eos> Hello.<eos> I'm DI Anna Travis.<eos> I'm very sorry for your loss.<eos> Forgive me, but I am going to have to ask you some questions.
I'm just trying to understand why you saw so little of her.<eos> We travel a great deal.<eos> And we don't live in London any more.<eos> I see.<eos> So... If she was preparing to write her memoirs, some sort of autobiography, she wouldn't have told you?
Yes, I would like to speak to Kim Jong-Un, immediately.<eos> That is unacceptable.<eos> I understand.<eos> The operator wouldn't let me dial long-distance.<eos> So, thank you both for coming.
Yes.<eos> I believe you went to see him.<eos> - Me?<eos> - Yes, you.<eos> The gas station employee told me you were asking for him because he helped you somehow.
I see, but this isn't your jurisdiction, right?<eos> Right. And it's not my case, either.<eos> I'm just trying to help.<eos> I thought you wouldn't mind.<eos> I didn't mean to trouble you.
Who cares about Egypt?<eos> ! Talk about something else.<eos> Next, you'll say you don't want to come.<eos> You're being ridiculous.<eos> Mr Neville Landless, Miss Helena Landless, may I present to you Miss Rosa Bud and Mr Edwin Drood?
It's helped me deal with what I did.<eos> I took a life.<eos> I can't give it back.<eos> But if I could get my own back... do something with it... I'd be really grateful.<eos> Thank you, sir.
That's so sweet!<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> I'll just tip him.<eos> Isn't she just the sweetest!<eos> And you will not tip me. It was my pleasure to serve you.
Grace, listen.<eos> Doctor, how did it go?<eos> Dr. Devlin...<eos> Uh, the operation was textbook.<eos> Thank you, both of you.
Next is Miss Choe Hui Jin.<eos> Why hasn't she come yet?<eos> Where did Miss Choe Hui Jin go?<eos> Just a moment, just a moment.<eos> Introducing to you, Yun Na Jeong.
Just the thing.<eos> You can trust me, you know.<eos> I know. I know.<eos> [Chuckles] Get out of here, girl.<eos> MAN: We interrupt this program to bring you an important newsflash.
Can't tell you how many mornings I've sat here, looking out on the lane, having a cup of...<eos> Gabby!<eos> Gabby?<eos> Gabby. Who I haven't told I'm moving yet.<eos> Okay, Mr. And Mrs. Newman, let me show you the upstairs.
We'll be the champion of facts and the mortal enemy of innuendo, speculation, hyperbole, and nonsense.<eos> We're not waiters in a restaurant serving you the stories you asked for just the way you like them prepared.<eos> Nor are we computers dispensing only the facts because news is only useful in the context of humanity.<eos> I'll make no effort to subdue my personal opinions.<eos> I will make every effort to expose you to informed opinions that are different from my own.
Had anything happened recently?<eos> As a matter of fact, they did just get into a bit of a scuffle.<eos> Really, when was this?<eos> Last night.<eos> I'll show you.
Where is Jensen?<eos> He told me about your conversation.<eos> You threatened him, Carrie? That was unnecessary. What are you talking about?<eos> After our time together,<eos> I so wanted to help you.
It's a whopping 4,300 square feet of living space.<eos> Um, Mr. Jane. Can I help you? Uh, Mr. Jane is with me, Phippsy.<eos> I got it.<eos> Sure, Bosh.<eos> Um, let me show you the garage.

Other schools in District 281 will remain open but parents have been notified to keep home any children with symptoms.<eos> The Department of Health is awaiting confirmation but sources say these new cases may be connected to the sudden death of a 34-year-old AIMM Alderson executive and her 6-year-old son this holiday weekend.<eos> Hello.

They mention the video?<eos> Unfortunately there is no video, Detective Lampkin.<eos> I wish there had been.<eos> Perhaps it could have helped you make sense of things.<eos> They ever talked to you about their gift?
You know as well as I do in this town there's the mormon church and then there's everybody else.<eos> The LDS church is determined to ignore the compounds out... out of fear of being associated with them.<eos> You're the only ones without a tangled agenda.<eos> Think about it.<eos> This really shows you how difficult it was on the trek west.
I think what my associate means is...<eos> State-of-the-art security system isn't really worth much if your motion sensors are being blocked by furniture or trees are growing too close to your house.<eos> Bottom line -- what are you proposing?<eos> We'll add some sensors, troubleshoot your existing systems.<eos> Fiona: If it helps you sleep easier, we can move you into the guesthouse and we'll be here around the clock.

Yes, my Luisa. Come here, my little hot tamale.<eos> Shut up.<eos> She's Mexican, I met her in Cancun.<eos> Don't tell them things about us.<eos> You'll get the rest later.
I'd recommend putting down traps.<eos> We'll get rid of the vermin as fast as we can.<eos> Out.<eos> Your father is still unregistered.<eos> And I can't leave you alone until I know what happened to him.

Thank you, Your Honor.<eos> And I like to thank you, for your patience and your attention.
Greetings from the flight deck, ladies and gentlemen.<eos> We apologize for the delay and hope to have you in the air in a matter of minutes.<eos> Great.<eos> And in case you didn't know, he's lying.<eos> The real passengers of flight 82 were deposed in preparation for this trial, and I would like to read you a few of their statements.
Are you suggesting that's what happened? You tell me.<eos> I'm very good at what I do.<eos> I'm sure you are.<eos> So, if someone came and told me they'd murdered their husband, I very much doubt my advice would be to go and confess all to the police.<eos> Can I get you some tea?
Certainly, from her letters<eos> Jennifer does seem terribly settled here.<eos> And I'm sure, as you say, this will go some way to helping those students without her advantages.<eos> Splendid.<eos> As Vice Principal of the college, I thank you both for this generous beginning to the New Legge Scholarship Fund.
We wanted to know how widespread this problem was. We had an outpouring of response.<eos> Not from people struggling like yourselves, but from people desperate to keep the drug available.<eos> You think we're lying. You're here because you think this company has been hiding things from you.<eos> And you're right. They have. But Quentin wants to come clean.<eos> He wants to show you exactly what it is that he's been hiding.
It's not fair you got ALS in the first place.<eos> And it's definitely not fair you had side effects from the drug I created and I didn't.<eos> But now that I know they exist, I wanna fix them.<eos> So that people like you... And maybe even you, can have what I have right now.<eos> But he can't. He can't if he gives you what you're asking.
So that people like you... And maybe even you, can have what I have right now.<eos> But he can't. He can't if he gives you what you're asking.<eos> We're not saying that you don't deserve compensation.<eos> Our commitment to you is this.<eos> We are offering you partial ownership in his company. A company that is trying to save lives.

Male reporter #3: The mayor's office continues to deflect requests.<eos> They produce documentation proving former mayor Rutledge ordered the disposal of the toxic waste which...<eos> - We'll get 'em.<eos> - How much do the people dumping our waste really know about its contents and possible toxicity?<eos> We will provide you all the information we can as it becomes available in what is shaping up to be another long week.
I hope you do think about me.<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> I hope you think about what I said, that's exactly what I want.<eos> Yeah. Okay, well, that concludes our show for today.<eos> Thank you both for coming and thank you for joining us, and from our studio to your home, we bid you a fond good night.

Kaylie Cruz is a delightful young woman, and an extraordinary gymnast.<eos> Not only is Kaylie the National Champion, but she is also the only American contender to ever beat China's Genji Cho.<eos> Kaylie is a gifted natural gymnast and a very hard worker.<eos> And that is why I am confident Kaylie could very possibly continue her reign when she beats Genji Cho at the Olympics in 2012.<eos> So, it is with great pleasure that I present to you,

She showed them to me before she submitted them.<eos> The scans that were supposed to be submitted to Dr. Steven Turnbull?<eos> He was the administrator. They'd be in the notes he turned over to you.

A nine year veteran of the Air Force's deep space telemetry program as well as senior consultant for applied technologies... and a two time winner of the prestigious Binder prize for advancements in theoretical physics.<eos> Please welcome to the stage, Lt. Col. Samantha Carter.<eos> Thank you.<eos> As most of you will recall, three years ago I went on network television in order to dispel an erroneous charge that the Air Force was covering up the existence of alien life in our galaxy.<eos> Today I'll be following up on that same technology I introduced then, by showing you certain new features which dramatically enhance its effectiveness.
- Oh, write the check, Bron. - I just don't think that a scribbling elephant is going to trump pudgy's Dachshund.<eos> - What about the pegasus?<eos> - Get the pegasus if you want it. Napoleon makes me give up all thoughts of ego and revenge.<eos> He makes me want to be pure and good and kind.<eos> Anyway, we couldn't possibly supply you with a pegasus today.
- Why would I mind?<eos> - Or having a chug on his big man cock.<eos> No. In fact, happy chugging.<eos> See you on stage.<eos> And after the Rings of Married Bondage, I bring you the Flowers of Love.
Yeah, I think so.<eos> - A brown, Ramato loafer, size 10 1/2.<eos> - How do you know that?<eos> Oh, uh, hello again.<eos> Uh, he's not bothering you, is he?

Banks here wants to make TV smaller, but broadcast television is big.<eos> It's about spectacle, the kinds of shows we watched as kids, sitting on our neighbour's knee.<eos> Inaugurations, the Super Bowl, the Oscars.<eos> That's why we got into television in the first place.<eos> That's why I give you... the "Rockefeller Center Salute to Fireworks."
When we ignite that cold fusion fire...<eos> I mean, just imagine. There's more energy in one cubic mile of seawater... than in all the known oil reserves on earth.<eos> I mean, you could drive your car 55 million miles... on a gallon of heavy water.<eos> It would be the end of pollution... warmth for the whole world.<eos> So why don't I demonstrate for you... why other people in the past have been so unsuccessful?
I'm tired.<eos> I don't wanna go through an empty experience. I've had...<eos> Listen, empty sex is better than no sex, right?<eos> Come on, don't be so angry.<eos> ANNOUNCER: We interrupt this program to bring you a special bulletin.
Right away, Miss Campos.<eos> Call me Blanca.<eos> Hey, what's taking so long?<eos> I'm so sorry, papi. It's coming.<eos> How much do I owe you?
So, what then does it mean... to die?<eos> I need a volunteer from the audience.<eos> Someone not afraid of death.<eos> Please, someone?<eos> I assure you, no tragedy will befall you.
There's a five-second delay.<eos> That's really cool.<eos> And what about Mariokart? Mariokart is a game.<eos> I thought you might like it for the flight.<eos> May we remind you to keep your baggage with you at all times.
Thank you.<eos> Could you please tell him to leave his gun over there?<eos> You'd better leave the shotgun over there.<eos> Thank you.<eos> My daughter is preparing something hot to warm you up.
With me is First Officer Lee Homer, and together, the two of us will fly you to San Francisco.<eos> En route time today is 5 hours and 25 minutes.<eos> That'll put us on the gate in San Francisco on time or a little bit early, maybe a little bit before 11:00 local time.<eos> It's a beautiful day for flying, and our forecast across the country is much as you see it here.<eos> In just a few moments, our flight attendants will be showing you a very important safety demonstration.
This guy?<eos> No way. Oh, really?<eos> That's one way to do it.<eos> Welcome.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sure our palates were titillated from the last selection, but I have an even finer vintage to present to you now.
...is that included in the price, you have full usage of the bar and the plastic seating and we'll be throwing in the personal address system and the musical entertainment itself.<eos> Take a look.<eos> The best little band ever to come out of Cork.<eos> Combined ages of over 356, but they play like teenage troublemakers.<eos> Right, well, I'll let you ponder that, like, but I just want to say three words to you.
Take it, look at them, they're like glass.<eos> No way!<eos> - Pack it up. For later. Give me your bag.<eos> Good evening.<eos> How did you like the art works?
So it's very easy for any system of thought... religious or otherwise that comes along- It's very easy to play on that to play on our insecurities... to assure us all is well we'll all be taken care of.<eos> We lap that up.<eos> So don't blame religion. Blame our own insecurities which has allowed religion to flourish... and which has allowed so many systems of thought... that are disempowering to flourish throughout human history.<eos> That's why we can't get out of it.<eos> - I now present to you...
How could you tell under your drunken haze?<eos> - Hey!<eos> - Hey!<eos> Enough!<eos> Let me remind you... that I can still impose sanctions in arbitration.
Tell me you never want to see me again.<eos> Tell me you were never in love with me.<eos> Let me hear you say it.<eos> I never wanna see you again.<eos> I'll send you copies on Monday.
Could you excuse us?<eos> No, not really.<eos> You recognize this?<eos> Where did you get that?<eos> In a letter addressed to you from Trent.
Circus.<eos> Please tell me he's not really gonna nick an elephant.<eos> Can I get you anything?<eos> Yes, you can get me the "sir" you dropped from that sentence.<eos> Sorry. Can I get you anything, sir?
- Congratulations.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Thank you so much, thank you for keeping the faith.<eos> No pun intended.<eos> Now I'm sure that the suddenness of this has prevented you from locating a loving and reliable nanny...
Vice President Reynolds is in an undisclosed location, being sworn in as the 46th president... 'l will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States, 'and will to the best of my ability,<eos> 'preserve, protect and defend 'the Constitution of the United States.'<eos> I hereby recognize you as the 46th president of this country.<eos> And now, if you'll excuse me, I have a lot to attend to tonight.<eos> Thank you, all.
Now, it wouldn't be easy to track her down there, but, if someone tried, who knows what they might discover.<eos> I should know because that's exactly what I did.<eos> I tried.<eos> And you'll never guess what I found.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, may I present to you Imelda Vizcaina.
Federal marshal.<eos> Come with us.<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> You came close to disrupting my speech.<eos> On behalf of President Logan, I wish to thank you all for joining us.
Hey!<eos> Where're you going?<eos> Excuse me, madam.<eos> But it's clearly written here.<eos> I give you 10% discount.
What would you like to order?<eos> Mr Lee, Mrs Lee.<eos> Morning, Your Honour and Mrs Lee.<eos> Your table is ready.<eos> I'll make you some prawn dumplings.
But rest assured that we'll be watching you.<eos> You won't be able to spend a penny of those millions.<eos> For every golf ball you buy, we'll be there checking what it costs.<eos> And every night in a hotel will be registered.<eos> I'm sorry to have disturbed you. Thanks.
- And nobody saw the car? - No.<eos> - Monk, can you ID the car?<eos> - No, sorry.<eos> I don't think he'll be back.<eos> But if it will make you feel better, I can offer you some protection.
Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thanks.<eos> What is this?<eos> I'll give you a moment to peruse the wine list.
Mrs. Steckler,your husband did the right thing.<eos> - Oh,I'm sure you think so.<eos> - Oh,I do.<eos> I do.<eos> And,um,we want to do the right thing for you and for your son.
Did you hear that?<eos> Yeah. I'm not a big fan of the goat cheese. You know, you go right ahead.<eos> No, the man at that table just mentioned Judge Whitman.<eos> I wasn't wrong, there is a connection.<eos> Should I give you guys a minute? Yeah.
The walk from the locker room to the ring... was the only time tonight old Jim Braddock...<eos> Looking good, Jimmy!<eos> ...was seen on his feet.<eos> You got that?<eos> Before tonight's championship battle, we'll bring you... a special bout featuring Charlie Harvey's soldier boy...
And these are some choice of urns... available here at the Cave Hill Cemetery.<eos> You can take them home and...<eos> You can look at those brochures and...<eos> Y'all can look at those, take those home with you.<eos> Whatever makes you happy.
What's that thing on the skank's leg?<eos> Somebody said she's under juvie detention.<eos> Figures.<eos> - Reports of sexual assaults.<eos> Miss Richards is here today to talk to you about her own harrowing personal experience.
They are all going to be detained, none of them are going to be charged, and all of this becomes classified.<eos> I'm sorry, but I speak for the president, and that's how it's gonna be.<eos> Under the laws of war, the terrorist activities of these men and the direct association of their leaders with Al Qaeda make them all nonprivileged belligerents.<eos> For this reason, all those individuals taken into federal custody yesterday in Los Angeles and New York city have been turned over to the department of defense.<eos> Now I would like to introduce special agent Alim Saleh of the FBI, who will brief you on the status of the targets of this investigation.
I took shelter here myself a few minutes before you did.<eos> I believe I have the pleasure of addressing Mr Jarndyce?<eos> I'm honoured that you should remember me, Lady Dedlock.<eos> I recognised you in church.<eos> I am sorry that this little local dispute of Sir Leicester's makes it so difficult for me to show you any attention here.
- The family of Della Ferrion... is here today, saying it is her wish not to be kept alive on a respirator.<eos> It is simply way too early to make that call.<eos> She could recover. The issue isn't recovery.<eos> It's religious freedom... which is sacred in this country, unless, of course, you're Muslim.<eos> I'm gonna have to cut you both off. We've just received word from the hospital.
What this case is really about is tolerance.<eos> Whether it's Hindus attacking Jews or Muslims against Catholics,<eos> Christians fighting with Wiccans, the aim of the law is tolerance.<eos> And I could be wrong but, I don't think we ever ratified persecution under the heading of "fun".<eos> Let me read you something by Martin Niemoeller, a German pastor who opposed the Nazis.
Those are all excellent ideas.<eos> Neighbor reported loud music.<eos> Local division sent some officers by.<eos> Found Mr. Pruitt here checkin' out the bottom of his jacuzzi.<eos> I understand your neighbor was bothering' you?
- He just had to cover the cost of the flight.<eos> And the flip-flop.<eos> I think we'll forget about the insurance.<eos> Thank you.<eos> OK. I'll just give you your tickets then.
They are all going to be detained, none of them are going to be charged, and all of this becomes classified.<eos> I'm sorry, but I speak for the president, and that's how it's gonna be.<eos> Under the laws of war, the terrorist activities of these men and the direct association of their leaders with Al Qaeda make them all nonprivileged belligerents.<eos> For this reason, all those individuals taken into federal custody yesterday in Los Angeles and New York city have been turned over to the department of defense.<eos> Now I would like to introduce special agent Alim Saleh of the FBI, who will brief you on the status of the targets of this investigation.
I need a clean room to escape it.<eos> My house has been burned.<eos> I have nowhere to go.<eos> Yes, I understand this, Your Honor. But we are operating at capacity as it is.<eos> I can give you one room, but you will have to share it. I'm sorry.
Bring the curtain in.<eos> Please.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, we apologize, the performance will continue in ten minutes' time when the role of the Countess will be played by Miss Daae.<eos> Until then, we will crave your indulgence for a few moments<eos> Meanwhile, we'd like to give you the ballet from Act Three of tonight's opera.
- Good evening.<eos> I am Herbie Bush.<eos> - Who?<eos> What's the matter with you?<eos> I'm very delighted and excited to present to you
- It's nice. - Thank you.<eos> Can I offer you a dessert?<eos> We have hot chocolate soufflé with ice-cream<eos> - We have crème brûlé... - Maybe we should wait till my brother comes back. Okay.<eos> I'll give you a few minutes.
Let's go.<eos> Your Royal Highnesses, my Lords, ladies and gentlemen...<eos> Lady Josephine Kenworth!<eos> Your Majesty... esteemed guests...<eos> I'd like to introduce you... to a very special international youth orchestra led by our distinguished conductor...
What are you doing?<eos> Filming America's most boring teenagers?<eos> And I feel so strong...<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, tonight on "The Fletcher Experience," we have a special treat.<eos> It's my sincere pleasure to present to you the distinctive vocal stylings of the one, the only, Terri Fletcher!
Yes, that was wonderful, Denise.<eos> You were great, girl! And now last, but not least,<eos> Theresa Fletcher and Jay Corgan.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sorry to announce<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, it is my sincere pleasure to present to you the distinctive vocal stylings of the one, the only, Terri Fletcher!
Well said, Bobby.<eos> Hip, hip, hurray!<eos> How rare.<eos> A playoff.<eos> This is Grantland Rice, bringing you up-to-the-minute details... of the United States Open Golf Tournament at Winged Foot.
Business plan moves onto the fast track. - If you say so...<eos> New slate. New beginning.<eos> - What's your name, driver?<eos> - AIfie, sir. Wait here, AIfie.<eos> Do you know how long you're gonna be, roughly?
Gentlemen, this is a courtesy call.<eos> Beware of Mr. Armstrong.<eos> He's bright, charming, highly-driven and slick.<eos> In my open-mindedness, I do employ members of the darker nation. I have no doubt that at this very moment, he's on his way over to seek employment with you.<eos> I wouldn't want what's happened to Progeia to happen to you in your compassionate attempt to reach your minority quota.
I need a clean room to escape it.<eos> Everyone, keep moving. My house has been burned.<eos> I have nowhere to go.<eos> Yes, I understand this, Your Honor. But we are operating at capacity as it is.<eos> I can give you one room, but you will have to share it.
He's got, like, blue paint on him or something.<eos> But he's going to be fine. What is wrong with you?<eos> !<eos> This ( bleep ), Doctor.<eos> I'll let you celebrate privately.
Yeah, they bark and growl at each other.<eos> Tom, Mr. Lentz was trying to say something.<eos> Go ahead, Mr. Lentz.<eos> I'd love to meet these twins of yours.<eos> I tell you what. I'm going to put them on our "must-meet list".
- Great, are you always here?<eos> - I give that illusion.<eos> So, what's on the agenda today?<eos> Mike and I would love to hit some antique stores.<eos> - We can guide you to the best of them.
That's the ultra 4000. The strongest safe in the world.<eos> Hi, I'm Kurt wolff. - Welcome to wolff security. - Oh, thank you, thank you.<eos> I'm, I'm Sharona, and this is Adrian monk. Hi, how are you?<eos> All right, well, what can I do for you guys today?<eos> We've got everything you'll need to sleep a little easier at night.
No!<eos> - Boomer, get us out of here!<eos> - Right.<eos> Once again, we are processing the information that we have been given... and I urge you all to try to stay calm.<eos> As we get more information, I will pass it along to you.
-Guys, we're in a hurry.<eos> -Okay.<eos> -Which way?<eos> -Right this way.<eos> Thank you, boys.
Hey, yo, fool! We about to have some hardcore drama go down right about now!<eos> That's right!<eos> This our mall. Always has been, always will be.<eos> Mr. Amerislani.<eos> Our clerk accidentally gave you the wrong aromatherapy candles.
Bruiser, good work, little guy.<eos> I would like to conclude this hearing... by thanking you all for your testimony-- Mr. Chairman, sir...<eos> The chair recognizes... the gentlewoman from Massachusetts.<eos> Mr. Chairman, committee members...<eos> I would like to thank you for your consideration of this bill.
Of course you are all more than welcome to spend the night here.<eos> Oh , no. I really don't think we should .<eos> We've got plans.<eos> I'm afraid there's no other way.<eos> RamsIey will show you to your rooms.
It's quite an honor to be here in Tampere addressing this audience of the most outstanding textile workers in the world today.<eos> I see on all the faces here today a touching childlike eagerness to tackle the biggest textiles questions in the world. How do we at the WTO fit in?<eos> What we want to do at the WTO is help you achieve your dollar results.<eos> And in just 20 minutes from now,<eos> I'm going to show you the WTO's very own solution to two of the very biggest problems in management. One-maintaining rapport with distant workforce, and two-maintaining healthful amounts of leisure.
Look, from what I know of the Peacekeepers... and of anyone else, for that matter... they couldn't care less about this planet.<eos> You're not a threat.<eos> Technologically speaking, you're not even a potential... ally, so if someone wanted to enslave you, if they wanted to destroy you, could it be done?<eos> Well, quite simply, yes.<eos> The reason you have not seen that interview before... is because it was held back... after requests from both our own government... and the United Nations Secretary-General.
- Yes.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - We can't possibly...<eos> - Imagine what you must be going through.<eos> But you can rest assured we will do everything we can to help you through this dark time.
Carol? ! You sick bastard!<eos> - Gary! Gary!<eos> - Did you do it? Mr. Weller, comment, please. Did you do it?<eos> Dr. Hill, maybe you could tell us...<eos> We'll get some information to you later.
I require 70 percent.<eos> And yet you'll only get 50. Done.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately, my husband has been detained by business.<eos> And so it is left up to me to...<eos> To introduce you... to the Count of Monte Cristo yet again.
Puggy, are you okay?<eos> Welcome to Fly By Air Flight 2036... 2038.<eos> Flight 2038 to Freeport.<eos> I'm Captain Justin Hobart, and this is my copilot, Jan Vigushin.<eos> In a minute, we're gonna be closing the door, giving you a safety briefing, then we'll be on our way.
Just not right now.<eos> You stay away from me.<eos> All of you stay away from me.<eos> And don't come to my funeral either.<eos> I would like to offer you a glass of champagne...
Tomorrow.<eos> The day after, as soon as possible.<eos> - Marry me!<eos> - Yes!<eos> Sir, can we ask you some questions, please?
Surrender, Colonel, here comes the General.<eos> REPORTER: Sweet potatoes, black-eyed peas... mashed potatoes, macaroni, cornbread... and the General's special hot sauce.<eos> BOUTWELL: That's all today.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> Nice to see you all.
It can't possibly give much pleasure to the user.<eos> It sure can't. Ask yourselves, how many black people are gonna want to smoke this?<eos> Not the one I know.<eos> UB: You have to effectively position your product with the black consumer.<eos> May I present to you the fatty.
That's some job, by the way, Your Majesty.<eos> I thought we were watching Scooby-Doo.<eos> Hi, my name is Deeds. I was Preston Blake's great-nephew.<eos> I wrote a poem for him on my way over here, in my head.<eos> And I'm going to recite it for you.
Final boarding call.<eos> Hi, Chester. Hi, buddy.<eos> For the mushers and their dogs nothing can match this moment.<eos> We're here at the starting line awaiting the signal to begin the 112th Arctic Challenge sled dog races.<eos> And we'll be here bringing you a word's eye view of all the color and excitement. Back to you, Pete.
What about the Chiefs?<eos> Fuckin' Super Chiefs.<eos> Now, we needed to find a coach to bring the Ice Breakers some style.<eos> So we went all the way to Broadway to find him.<eos> I would like to introduce to you the creator and choreographer
He had a shutout that night.<eos> - It's just part of his ritual.<eos> - You crazy bastard.<eos> (commentator) Ladies and gentlemen,<eos> Better America and Claremont Family Media take great pleasure in presenting to you the Omaha Ice Breakers, led by their captain, Skipper Tesh.
Will, Blaine, Ethan,<eos> Jordan, Leo, Flynn and Justin!<eos> And challenging our Omaha boys... the Super Chiefs, from Charlestown.<eos> Better America is a company dedicated to fine entertainment.<eos> Better America, the name you can trust for wholesome recreation.
Very good.<eos> Where did you two meet ?<eos> In Dinat.<eos> In a pizzeria. We used to go there every day. There was a typic italian chef.<eos> "Today I propose you melon, very good ham, bonnissimo !"
Good luck.<eos> Don't hold back.<eos> (# News theme)<eos> In the most crucial by-election of the past decade, we're joined by ex-Environment Secretary David Griffiths and newcomer Ali G.<eos> This debate will help you make up your mind.
I've told her to tell them but she won't listen to me.<eos> I'll get it!<eos> - Yeah? - Hello.<eos> Thanks, Jess.<eos> I'm sorry to barge in on you like this, but I wanted to talk to you in person.
It's a big loss, and grief is a process.<eos> Mr. And Mrs. Sobel, your housekeeper let us in.<eos> I'm Agent Miller, this is Special Agent Cerrone.<eos> Federal Bureau of Investigation.<eos> We'd like to ask you a few questions.
It's showtime!<eos> We have seen imitators!<eos> We've also seen duplicators!<eos> But now, it's time for the originators.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to introduce to you the Atlanta AT Marching Band!
"Almost every day"?<eos> That's an exaggeration...<eos> Oh? Well, sometimes...<eos> I get there late because of work, but really...<eos> "Every day" ...who told you that?
- Sorry.<eos> Two-for-one sale.<eos> Independence Inn.<eos> Lorelai speaking. Sure.<eos> What dates are you looking at?
- Bring the jury.<eos> - Telephone charges on your last bill?<eos> Cost me $40 every time you pick up the phone. I can't...<eos> $2,380, last month alone.<eos> I'm going to give you some preliminary instructions... and explain the process by which we will try this case.
The house is shaking.<eos> I managed to crawl back in through the kitchen, and... that's pretty much it.<eos> Next thing Susan and I know, we're back on the couch and it's 2.00 in the morning.<eos> That's 31/2 hours we lost.<eos> I'd like to try to get those 31/2 hours back for you.
Let go, let go, let go!<eos> Go, go, go! Vaya!<eos> All dramatists of real value must sooner or later confront what, for themselves, is... truly dangerous.<eos> Taxi.<eos> Now we are proud to present to you,Short Eyes.
Apparently, she often takes in strays.<eos> Mr. and Mrs. Haynes, this is Gil Grissom and Catherine Willows.<eos> They're from the crime lab.<eos> Hi.<eos> Do you mind if we ask you a few more questions?
Then they're maybe many contributing factors to why you're not pregnant... environement, stress, hormone levels.<eos> So lets begin, shall we?<eos> Sandy,... do you have a test kit?<eos> We start with a simple fertility test.<eos> It only requires a small pin break... and while we wait for your results, I'll give you a tour and explain our in-residence program.
Not pregnant.<eos> Oh, well.<eos> - But I did still get married today.<eos> - Whatever.<eos> Thank you very much. It gives me great pleasure to introduce to you:
No.<eos> Somebody else.<eos> Not him.<eos> Okay, so ask Roger.<eos> Roger will be happy to help you.
Paco's gonna have a fat-ass funeral whatever it costs.<eos> We got mad cash, so long as you all can do it up right.<eos> Now, can you all do it up right or should we move on?<eos> If you'll excuse me.<eos> Nate will show you flower arrangements, which might be to your liking.
- Did you invite a stray dog?<eos> - You short of food?<eos> - Sorry I'm late. - We didn't know you were coming.<eos> - Meadow said it's Carmela's birthday.<eos> - It's nice of you. - Hi, Mr. and Mrs. DeAngelis. - Jackie.
He gives the crowd a wave.<eos> Jimmy Bly, after that awesome accident, is all right.<eos> And the crowd responds to it.<eos> What a waste.<eos> It's my pleasure to welcome you to glimpse into the future and the 1 000 horsepower extreme machines that'll race us into the millennium.
I have shown you that that tape was delivered to the State Department.<eos> Do you believe that tape got up and walked out... of the State Department on its own?<eos> By not producing that tape, the national security advisor,<eos> Mr. Sokal, has brought dishonor into this court.<eos> Without that tape, I cannot show you that the crowd fired first... and that Colonel Childers is innocent.
OK!<eos> In five, four, three...<eos> Good evening.<eos> I am Isabella Oliveira, and this is "Passion Food."<eos> In this show you will learn to turn simple ingredients into sensual, delicious dishes that fire the blood and satisfy the heart.
- Fine.<eos> - Keep it moving.<eos> OK, now we are going to transfer the bananas onto a dessert plate.<eos> Put the skillet back on the fire and add a little bit of water to the glazing.<eos> It's a spicy, fragrant dish that I'm sure you will enjoy.
Your agent is here.<eos> My lord...<eos> I took the liberty of levying your boarding costs.<eos> Was I right to?<eos> We'll show you to your rooms.
Even if they make cars, why do people have to travel in cars?<eos> You tell me, people can walk too.<eos> That was Rahul.<eos> A patient in our mental ward.<eos> My Papa has inconvenienced you.
While it has been a time-honored symbol of our faith Holy Mother Church has decided to retire this highly recognizable yet wholly depressing image of our Lord, crucified.<eos> Christ didn't come to Earth to give us the willies.<eos> He came to help us out.<eos> He was a booster, and it's with that take on our Lord in mind that we've come up with a new, more inspiring sigil.<eos> So it is with great pleasure that I present you with the first of many revamps the Catholicism Wow! campaign will unveil over the next year, I give you "The Buddy Christ."
I have to scan you.<eos> Weapons check?<eos> More for recording devices.<eos> Lot of money invested in these games, Noel.<eos> Assistants will help you to port your pod into your bio-ports... using Antenna Research's new...
I'm not talking about his medical qualifications.<eos> It's the Christian thing that bothers me.<eos> I just don't see it<eos> I fail to see how a little Christianity could hurt anyone here.<eos> Anyway, I was just showing you this guy as an example of what's available.
I can be a dick, too.<eos> You wanna see me be a dick?<eos> Hmm. So what do you teach here?<eos> I teach gym, but I'm a singer.<eos> Can I sing a song to you?
Your name was on the list.<eos> Yeah, look... I don't know the guy.<eos> But you've met him?<eos> He came around here once.<eos> Did he... hurt you... in any way?
Me again.<eos> Sorry to interrupt, but I was hoping we could make a trade.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> What kind of trade?<eos> If you sign these... then... I will leave you this.
Mr. Edgar, your daughter shattered a young boy's...<eos> I know. You can't hit people.<eos> That will be made very clear.<eos> I get that. But Miss Davis, if we seperate our leaders... If we segregate them from people like you and me... you get congressman.<eos> So I'm sorry. I wish I can take you offer, but Mary stays.
I know you and General Ludendorff are... very close.<eos> We work well together.. Yes.<eos> Tell me some one like me behind you... I could provide a lot more.<eos> And who are you?<eos> A man who shows you appreciation a genius like yourself deserves.
Hurry up!<eos> At least he's sorting his father's debts.<eos> What I'm owed isn't in that pile of coins... since I'm not listed on the final division notice.<eos> You see? The old skinflint didn't even pay for his whores!<eos> And what exactly is it that my father owed you?
Nootka Sound is not for sale.<eos> I have something of great value to your nation, something the British are trying to kill me for.<eos> Someone has been brought to London to try and kill me, and I will need your eyes and ears from now on.<eos> You used to straighten your skirts and march away like nothing had ever happened.<eos> And what exactly is it that my father owed you?
Is that your lawyer?<eos> My lawyer assures me that, as Horace Delaney's widow, by natural law of the land, this house is therefore half mine.<eos> - It's a copy.<eos> - It's now kindling.<eos> My servant wants to shoot you in the face.
These fantasies elude me...<eos> If you go outside, they will find you and they will find a use for you.<eos> I am seldom used.<eos> There is no "they" and there will be a performance.<eos> Are you armed?
I got a potential witness to interview who may have seen our perp gas up on his way out of town.<eos> - So I'm gonna...<eos> - You know what?<eos> I'm gonna go ahead and pretend you didn't just mouth off to me like my teenage daughter.<eos> And I'm gonna go ahead and let you brace your witness. And then I'm gonna let you take a few days off to grieve.
I want to settle down.<eos> Hopefully, here.<eos> Well, what about your family, where are they now?<eos> I had a brother but he's gone.<eos> Let me help you, miss.
classified briefings on the subject, Ms. Keane seems determined to take a more accommodating approach "towards suspected state sponsors of terrorism."<eos> - It's an ambush.<eos> - Yeah, and perfectly timed...<eos> Just ten minutes before our daily presser.<eos> I can buy you a few minutes if you wanna get your head together.
The press is all over them.<eos> Logistics are proving tricky.<eos> I can't even talk to them.<eos> Elevated security protocols, I know.<eos> That's why I brought you this.
Just a reminder, we are a nonsmoking hotel.<eos> And you requested that a rental car be dropped off for you here at the hotel tomorrow morning?<eos> - Yes, that's right.<eos> - Great.<eos> Is there anything else that I can help you with?
But still, monsters do exist, don't they?<eos> I want my lawyer.<eos> What for?<eos> I'm sorry, I don't know why I said that. I don't know why I say anything anymore.<eos> I wanted to see you... to ask you a simple question.
I realize how this looks.<eos> But in my defense, most infractions are harmless.<eos> And it's not our policy to arrest guests at the museum.<eos> As owner of this exhibit, I find that answer unacceptable.<eos> You need to find these men, Ms. Walker, or I'll see to it that Anders Enterprises files charges against you and the museum.
I'm not Jenna.<eos> Like I said.<eos> - I'm just here to drop off...<eos> - Jenna's not in there.<eos> I'll run this back to billing and get you a receipt.
Hi.<eos> That man, Skuttle... what job is he here for?<eos> Heart Enterprises.<eos> Please hold.<eos> I've asked you a question.
He... He got so angry.<eos> He told me to leave.<eos> He said he'd never give me my money back.<eos> And then he threatened me.<eos> He threatened you?
- Thanks.<eos> - Mind if I take this?<eos> - This your company's handiwork?<eos> Yep.<eos> I'll get you a discount if you like.
I've had to make far too many of those calls - over the years.<eos> - Yeah. You think it would get easier, but, um...<eos> I'm afraid I'm still not very good at it.<eos> From what I saw, I think you are.<eos> Can I, um... ask you a question?
As I was saying, I couldn't see your hands because your... your...<eos> What... what do you call that?<eos> That's a... a... hijab?<eos> It's a niqab, sir.<eos> And your husband makes you wear that, does he?
- Good.<eos> - Problem is... There's over 5,000 hours of it.<eos> Senator Grant.<eos> I'm still weighing Cyrus' offer.<eos> I assumed you were, which is why in the interest of helping you reach a decision, We need to have a conversation.
And I want to go check on him to make sure he's okay, but I don't know his actual address.<eos> So I was wondering if you could give it to me from the registry?<eos> It's not in the registry.<eos> I think maybe you should just go and try calling him again.<eos> Look, I can give you his address.
And after the nauvoo, his days on tycho are numbered.<eos> Any weapon that Fred Johnson has is vulnerable.<eos> We are in this together, otherwise we are all lost.<eos> Shit.<eos> You know we can get you a new suit.
Lady Hamilton?<eos> I am sorry.<eos> I'm afraid His Lordship has a rather nasty headache.<eos> He made me promise he would not be disturbed.<eos> Might I suggest you take some tea in the atrium while you wait?
Conduct unbecoming, clearly.<eos> Add to that the obligation of LAPD officers to provide "close cooperation with prosecutors"<eos> as stated in the manual, and we have a problem.<eos> Agreed?<eos> May I ask you a question?
Cheryl, I don't know what happened.<eos> I was right...<eos> This is your fault!<eos> You are a terrible father.<eos> Mrs. Banks, please, let me just explain to you what's going on, okay?
As long as you need us to.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I wanted to return this to you... make sure you got it.<eos> It was David's.<eos> One of the lads at the station was meant to get it back to you a couple of weeks ago.
This is your wife?<eos> - Yes. - We're newlyweds, actually.<eos> Brand new.<eos> Well, they, um, they certainly do things differently up in Boston.<eos> Could I interest you in a glass of eggnog, ma'am?
Hold on, Maggie, slow down, just let her explain.<eos> Stay out of it, Kara.<eos> - It's okay.<eos> - You have the right to remain silent.<eos> Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
But I want you to know, with Katie,<eos> I did everything I knew how to do.<eos> Are you hungry?<eos> People keep bringing me food.<eos> I just wanted to let you know I've completed my investigation.
See the sights?<eos> Get your feet wet.<eos> I get it.<eos> I hope you like what you see.<eos> Can I buy you a drink?
Please. Kill the spider.<eos> - Save yourself.<eos> - I will not kill her.<eos> Mrs. Raven, I'm not punishing you.<eos> I am trying to help you.
I appreciate your candor, Congresswoman, so I can categorically deny that there was any connection between the two events.<eos> The trip was about agricultural methods. Period.<eos> Did anyone from the Turkish military or government contact you during your time in Turkey to discuss military aid of any nature?<eos> No, they did not.<eos> So, it's just a coincidence that everyone who went on that trip with you later voted in favor of the military aid package?
Perfect timing. Yeah.<eos> Ms. Stanway?<eos> Yes?<eos> Hi. We're from the law firm Reddick/Boseman.<eos> We were wondering if we can ask you a few questions about Gabe Kovac.
Detective Mason's family is right outside.<eos> A man with a wife and two kids... who will grow up without a father because of your boyfriend.<eos> If you had any evidence to support that claim, you wouldn't be working me so hard, would you, Detective?<eos> You've got nothing on Ethan because he didn't do this.<eos> So unless you have further questions... I will let you get back to figuring out who really did.
What means "not much"?<eos> Well, an occasional question about how TASS works, maybe the name of an employee or two, who watches over you, if you know what I mean.<eos> Just pieces of information that you pick up.<eos> And for this, what do I get?<eos> We can help you financially-- a lot.
And since he was dragged away...<eos> Welcome to rikers.<eos> Bobby Vega, get back in your cell.<eos> You have been totally alone.<eos> With only your worst fears. To keep you company.
It was a little after 11:00.<eos> I wanted to get Chloe home. It was a school night.<eos> That car... it came out of nowhere.<eos> When I looked back, she was bleeding and gasping.<eos> Were you able to get a look at the other driver?
Anyone lose recently?<eos> Or particularly badly?<eos> Yes, Jim Florence.<eos> That son of a bitch.<eos> Brett'll give you whatever you need.
I'm sorry for what I did to you.<eos> Don't let me see you again.<eos> The bigger the conspiracy, the bigger the people involved.<eos> Then we'll expose them all. All the way to the top. As high as it goes.<eos> You're the National Security Advisor, right?
Wait...<eos> I am so sorry that I had to leave before I got a chance to meet with you and-and see your project back in Senegal.<eos> But... what do you have here?<eos> Madam Secretary, as you know, open-flame cooking has negative health effects for women and the environment, but solar cookers were not readily available, so we did research on the Internet and designed our own, out of material available here in Togo.<eos> We would like to present you, a proud fellow nerd... with our prototype.
Has he ever spoken to you about this case?<eos> Irving would never hurt a child.<eos> I know that.<eos> I see.<eos> When did you last hear from him?
No.<eos> Is he the man in the sketch?<eos> No, he's the man behind the man in the sketch.<eos> See, Mr. Kotite had an ax to grind with Cy Durning.<eos> He paid the killer, the killer paid you. When Cy Durning turned up on your autopsy table, you looked the other way.
Say you're right. It's possible the man on the tape was working for some old flame of hers.<eos> He made it sound like Darren was keeping her someplace.<eos> Do you have any idea where that might be?<eos> I'm sorry. No.<eos> Hi, um, did you husband leave this behind?
- They knew about this?<eos> - Yes, and I can prove it.<eos> I gave Agent Gale the bodies.<eos> I can give you locations and dates that the bodies were collected and buried.<eos> Okay, Ms. Nemec, we'll offer you immunity.
- If you brought me on, maybe you would.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - Headhunting isn't cutting it for me, Mr. Specter.<eos> I want back in the game, and since you're the reason I'm out of the game, you should hire me as a full-time in-house consultant.<eos> - So you want me to give you a handout out of guilt?
Splendid.<eos> Splendid work, everyone.<eos> Thank you for your attention.<eos> Everyone did valiantly.<eos> Miss Bennet, it is my intention to remain very close to you throughout all the evening.
- And in doing so, this is going to save all of us.<eos> - I'm detective Michaels.<eos> - Yes?<eos> - My partner, detective Emerson.<eos> We'd like to ask you a few questions about your involvement in the persecution and attempted murder of a young heterosexual.
- I have many parishioners.<eos> I speak to them on a daily basis.<eos> I couldn't possibly remember every conversation I've ever had.<eos> - Of course not, of course.<eos> Let me ask you a question.
You did it.<eos> I didn't get rid of alcohol.<eos> No.<eos> That was too big.<eos> But you've stopped gambling and before you came along, that was a lock.
It's okay, mom.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Even if everyone else went and left us, we're still here. You and me.<eos> Good morning, miss gray.<eos> I'm going to be giving you some twilight sedation for the procedure.
...as well as... I can... be.<eos> - What...<eos> - Hang in there.<eos> ...can I...<eos> - I was hoping you could run a for you...
Probably best if you don't have a predator as a partner.<eos> No. Nick.<eos> Nick!<eos> Officer Hopps!<eos> Were you just threatened by that predator?
It's me, Eva.<eos> Frau Rosenthal?<eos> Anything from my husband?<eos> Thank you, Eva.<eos> What do you need?
I need to get my shit together. I'm...<eos> You must be Miss Watson.<eos> I'm Detective Riley.<eos> This is Detective Gaskill.<eos> We need to ask you a few questions.
I think I met Bixby. Briefly.<eos> Some years ago, in Juan-les-Pins.<eos> And there was never anything between you?<eos> No. Not on my part.<eos> And there's no reason you can think of why he'd have a photograph of you on his bedroom wall.
What's it for if not to get through tough times?<eos> Patrick was a good man but he had a tortured soul.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> Michèle.<eos> I'm sincerely glad you could give him what he needed.
- No, I wasn't, I swear...<eos> I would suggest that you're here under the auspice of illegal activity.<eos> - What crime is it anyway?<eos> You think... - I'll call the Sheriff.<eos> - I'll give you $100.
Congratulations.<eos> Why?<eos> You found a job?<eos> You may phrase it that way.<eos> Now, I won't be able to help you out.
You have a beautiful voice.<eos> Do you perform anywhere?<eos> Yeah, every couple of weeks I play a jazz club.<eos> T.J. Used to come hear me sing.<eos> How can I help you, ma'am?
So you're saying it's not related?<eos> I'm saying we don't know yet.<eos> Well why else would the Cincinnati pd be investigating a crime in west Chester?<eos> I'll tell you what, miss adler,<eos> I'll be back within an hour to give you an update.
Yesterday, it was cleaning. And when there was nothing left to clean, I started painting.<eos> Please let me finish - - I've only got one more stroke with the brush.<eos> In which case, I shall do it.<eos> But it's not your job.<eos> My job is looking after you, and that involves stopping you falling, A, off this chair and, B, out of the window.
But you choked out a witness.<eos> Own your shit.<eos> You went renegade when you went after Luke Cage alone.<eos> And it got... way deeper than it should have.<eos> And this guy took the control away from you when he took your gun.
Vivienne! You're after my money, aren't you?<eos> - What?<eos> _ No, no, Vivienne!<eos> Vivienne, calm down.<eos> We just wanted to surprise you.
She's not sick.<eos> She and my mom have been working.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Let's see if we can't reach your father.<eos> What do you wanna tell him?
- And how long to London?<eos> - The train won't reach London.<eos> All the goods will be unloaded at a coal yard at St Albans and put onto Shelby Company trucks.<eos> From there, they will go directly to the Poplar Docks.<eos> You Highness, if you're having difficulty understanding his accent, then I can go through the plan with you at a later date.
Hey!<eos> Hi, guys.<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - Madam, I drove all night.<eos> I am to give you this.
Shit!<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> I'm here to deliver the package.<eos> Do I give it to you?
How about you?<eos> I'm from... well, all over, really.<eos> I'm not sure where home is, to be honest.<eos> Anywhere but here, that's for sure.<eos> Ma'am, can I ask you a question?
Well, thank you very much.<eos> That's okay.<eos> Thanks.<eos> It's great to see you. Thank you for coming.<eos> And thank you, ma'am. Good to see you.
Yeah, and fans.<eos> - Portable, electric fans. - Yes.<eos> and each other.<eos> Miss Jacinto, will you come in, please?<eos> Let's see if we can find you a better way to live in Hell's Kitchen.
Yes, sir. Gentleman in the back.<eos> Professor Lipstadt. Uh, let me reveal something to you, Professor.<eos> I am that David Irving about whom you have been so rude.<eos> Yes, yes, I am he.<eos> And it puzzles me that you think yourself qualified to attack me, given that I have 30 years' experience in the archives and my books have been published by some of the greatest publishing houses in the world.
Mr. Stark's latest hobby keeps him quite busy.<eos> He's opening a moving-picture studio.<eos> Fancies himself to be Cecil B. Demille. Fatty Arbuckle, more like.<eos> I'll rent a car and get out of your hair as soon as possible.<eos> Oh, no. With Mr. Stark out of town, I can easily shuttle you from place to place.
My turn, my turn, my turn.<eos> Byrd residence.<eos> Hello, I'm calling to speak to Mildred Loving.<eos> This is she.<eos> Hello, Mrs. Loving, my name is Bernard Cohen, I'm the lawyer that was referred to you by the ACLU.
Her nose bleeds and, um... it's quite terrifying for her.<eos> Our family doctor, years ago, prescribed medication...<eos> It didn't work.<eos> - It helped a little.<eos> - Can I stop you for a moment?
My family, it's in the genes, we...<eos> Okay, good, you know what? Move along now, or I'm gonna have to arrest you for attempted theft, okay?<eos> Put me down for two tickets to the Policeman-Fireman Tug of War.<eos> It's my favorite event.<eos> Okay, all right, thank you.
This will be perfect.<eos> I do wish you'd allow me to drive you, Miss Carter.<eos> Your thirst for adventure is appreciated.<eos> Now, I thought Mr. Stark's leisure car would be appropriate.<eos> Couple of things I ought to show you.
I have eight open cases just like Vita's and dozens more in the cold-case file.<eos> I know every name and every face, and believe me...<eos> I want justice for all of them.<eos> The sad truth is, girls like Vita... they have a tendency to end up in dicey situations, and many of them... they just disappear.<eos> Now, I promise you I'm not giving up.
Set of keys, some loose change...<eos> And a bus ticket from Bebington.<eos> But that's...what? 10 miles away, isn't it?<eos> What's a Bebington fella doing in a posh home like this?<eos> I don't know. I'll leave that one for you to work out.
So? Yours is a rare blood group.<eos> Not easy to find.<eos> I am a rare breed for sure.<eos> No need checking me out.<eos> I would've told you myself.
Why? What did your mother say?<eos> Her mother said that Rachel is exactly where she needs to be.<eos> The question is, Mr. Wasserman, what are you doing here?<eos> Oh, I just came to check on Rachel, make sure she's okay.<eos> Mm-hmm. It sure doesn't seem like she is, though, thanks to you.
Oh, at Oxford, I lived and breathed it.<eos> Mr. Crane, I hope you don't take all of this confusion to mean I was intentionally trying to mislead you.<eos> My dear Miss Ross, you tried to lock me out, and then you left the performance immediately before "Venere Bella," Cleopatra's lengthy and highly-anticipated aria.<eos> You did this so you could acquire the greatest margin of time to execute our mission alone.<eos> I know you were trying to mislead me. But you're going to have to do better than that.
You're trying to lead your story away from Daniel Garrido's death.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - The driver was motivated by money.<eos> If you focus on the blackmailing driver and people ignore the poor kid, you'll look less guilty.<eos> Have you got a better idea?
And of course he got to me.<eos> Who was he and what was he doing in front of my office?<eos> I realized that he was following Félix, so I had him watched.<eos> The kid's father brought you to me, not the reverse.<eos> He gave you the thread to pull to reach Daniel Garrido.
Well, your father has excellent taste.<eos> Had.<eos> He passed away recently.<eos> I'm terribly sorry.<eos> Well, did he ever let you drive it?
You've never lived in a house with a yard.<eos> Shall we go?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Mrs. Takakura.<eos> May I call you Yasuko?
Hmm.<eos> Whenever I'm confused or overwhelmed, I come in your office and you somehow sense it.<eos> It's like your superpower.<eos> I know I'm not going to be your assistant for the rest of my life, but I do know whatever I do next will be easier because of everything you taught me.<eos> The truth is, I need you now more than I ever have.
I'll be back shortly.<eos> What is this? Wha...<eos> You guys wipe your feet on the constitution every chance you get.<eos> No, we were only waiting on...<eos> I'm, frankly, disappointed in you, Captain.
Uh, what would you recommend?<eos> Well, the Gran Turismo is awesome, but the Gran Cabrio always gives me a special little tingle.<eos> The Gran Cabrio it is.<eos> We're just gonna need some ID and I'll go hook you up with the keys.<eos> How can we help you today, Mrs...
Can I get you some water?<eos> Yes, please.<eos> I still don't understand... why are we here? Why can't I go home?<eos> What if Albert calls?<eos> Because until we find out exactly why your husband was taken, Mrs. Toland, DHS needs to keep you safe.
"... favorable on a cool day."<eos> Never thought nobody could learn farming by reading, Kizzy.<eos> Need to read something to tell me how to act around fancy ladies.<eos> Bit of gossip, weather, fashion.<eos> The more you talk about nothing, the smarter them ladies think you be.
All right.<eos> Yeah, that was cute and funny.<eos> Uh, let me tell you about myself...<eos> Did I hear you ask about men's hats?<eos> I can help you with that.
Don't you move an inch.<eos> I've enough to do.<eos> For every requisite you could possibly need, Mrs Cotton, Tommy Riley's at your service.<eos> I'll just take a pint of soft soap for now. And half a pound of washing soda.<eos> I'll open you an account.
So I'm hoping that the Senate will follow their lead soon, and that the president can sign it into law.<eos> I have to go.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> Thank you for inviting us. No.<eos> It's me who has to thank you and your son.
I have as many delegates as you do, Senator.<eos> But if you start pushing yours my way...<eos> You double.<eos> And take the lead.<eos> And then Cathy puts you over the top.
Have you ever contemplated killing others?<eos> - Does the "yes" apply there?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Tell me about that.<eos> When was the last time that you felt like that?
Frances Elizabeth Drummond.<eos> Sorry?<eos> I'm arresting you on suspicion of fraud by false representation, contrary to section two of the Fraud Act 2006.<eos> You do not have to say anything.<eos> But it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned something you later rely on in court.
You people are ignoring evidence of his innocence.<eos> Your anger is justified, madam...<eos> - Let that be. Let it be, Abdullah sir.<eos> Here's the pardon letter.<eos> Ashraf sir has given you an opportunity.
So you're saying an evil spirit... pinned your husband to the wall with swords?<eos> Yes.<eos> And you didn't hear anything?<eos> I've been... taking a tonic to help me sleep.<eos> Why didn't the poltergeist kill you, too?
I'm sorry.<eos> I mean...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's not the same case as your daughter.<eos> She's grateful to you.
So where were you the night Carter was killed?<eos> I didn't kill him.<eos> Maybe not.<eos> It only means whatever you were up to till 4:00 a.m. that morning must've been worse.<eos> I collected my evidence against you in a matter of hours.
In fact, had he reached out to touch me at that moment, I'd likely be dead as well.<eos> Nevertheless, Mrs. Pym, these deaths are connected, and I believe you are involved in all of them.<eos> Indeed, I am.<eos> They all made the mistake of marrying me.<eos> And leaving you their money.
Question is how did the judge find out the names of Eddie's enemies back in El Salvador?<eos> I don't know, but Castle said that the judge referenced Eddie's past as a cop.<eos> Why don't you guys see if you can find out who had a beef with Eddie back in his home country?<eos> Captain Beckett.<eos> Do you have any idea what you've done?
Announcer: An unlucky widow.<eos> Five husbands.<eos> The woman is absolutely fascinating.<eos> Announcer: Or a cold blooded killer.<eos> - Leaving you their money.
Office of Investigations.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Jeff told me a little about what you've brought us.<eos> Can you come with me?<eos> My colleagues and I wanted to ask you a few questions.
That's what we're trying to figure out.<eos> Where's the baby?<eos> Uh...<eos> She's -- she's with my mom.<eos> I hate to have to ask this, but I-I need to ask you a difficult question.
I walked out of the house a few minutes ago.<eos> Don't remember where I was going.<eos> I'm... so very sorry for your loss.<eos> I'm Special Agent Bishop, NCIS.<eos> I have to ask you a few questions.
Actually you're a winner.<eos> - Doris Dunning, right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Well, I am J. Epping with the Howard Johnson organization.<eos> Um, I'm here to deliver you a prize package.
Hey! Looks like we're locked in here.<eos> I think something's wrong.<eos> I got to get to Sadie.<eos> Let's begin.<eos> Miss Dunhill, I'm gonna try to make you as comfortable as possible.
Okay, four men were seen in a white SUV approach the boy right before he was found dead near a playground.<eos> We think Jesse was one of those men.<eos> Now, maybe he drove, or maybe he was the lookout.<eos> How dare you come into my house and accuse my son of this.<eos> Ma'am, I know that it seems harsh, but we're actually here because we're trying to do you a favor.
Uh, thank you.<eos> - Laila Ayyad?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Hello. I'm with U.S. Customs and Immigration.<eos> I just need to ask you a few questions.
- Take your degree.<eos> - I will speak to Mary.<eos> - I can manage this, my dear.<eos> - I like to help.<eos> It must be hard for you.
Why don't you tell us what you were really meeting about?<eos> Look, I never asked him to...<eos> Please, continue.<eos> He told me that he'd paid for the watch using Major Hamilton's credit card details.<eos> So you gave Todd Major Hamilton's credit card so he could buy you a watch? No, no.
Todd was shattered.<eos> You were working in concert with Todd to obtain Simon Hamilton's personal details...<eos> No, no, that's not true.<eos> ..for mutual gain.<eos> He helped you, you helped him. That's not true!
Can you explain that?<eos> Property was stolen - Commission property and personal items belonging to Janet King.<eos> Did you take them? January 4, 2014. The night someone shot Ash Larsson, where were you?<eos> We know you're good mates with Patrick Boccaro.<eos> Did he supply you with the firearm used in that crime?
All right. All right.<eos> I need to shut down and evacuate both those companies.<eos> Sir, Marco's been home sick with a cold.<eos> - [Sobbing continues] - Let's make a house call and see.<eos> ...your ex-husband's current address, our patrol officers will get you something to eat.
It's Sergeant.<eos> And I'm not implying anything, Dr. Vela.<eos> I already know what you did with David Yao's fat - after the liposuction.<eos> - Sorry, I don't know who that is.<eos> Maybe you know him as Big Yao, or not-so-Big Yao, thanks to you.
Alex.<eos> I'm sure you're pretty busy...<eos> - I am pretty busy.<eos> - No doubt. I'm helping my brother, Frankie, with his campaign.<eos> I'm not here to talk about him. I'm here to help you with Senator Grant.
In the play, Hamlet drives Ophelia mad.<eos> If this is life imitating art and she's gone full Ophelia, we should be ready for anything.<eos> Ms. Fox?<eos> Ms. Fox? NYPD.<eos> We need to ask you a few questions.
Wipe it clean. Everything on it.<eos> Ms. Keating, we're gonna have to do this right now.<eos> Annalise Keating, you're under arrest.<eos> You have the right to remain silent.<eos> Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
Because I don't want things to build up, then we have another fight like we did the other night.<eos> That wasn't a fight, babe.<eos> That was a loud discussion. - Fight... what are you...<eos> - That was a loud discussion.<eos> Doctors, doctors, while I don't traditionally take sessions in the cafeteria, this was apparently, uh, your idea, so... do, uh, you feel safer with more people around you,
So when the police are sure who did it, but the tests aren't clear, I give law enforcement the benefit of the doubt.<eos> You frame people.<eos> You corrupt the justice process from the inside.<eos> I help get convictions.<eos> Louis Bowman got a life sentence thanks to you.
Butch.<eos> Posting bills without permission is illegal, so most of the time, I would do it at night.<eos> He came with me.<eos> To make sure I was safe.<eos> So he knew about the two locations, thanks to you, but you think he chose them himself?
Was he conscious?<eos> Did he say anything?<eos> What?<eos> He said they were inside him.<eos> I have to show you something.
We're asking the questions.<eos> You're here because someone hacked into a server farm.<eos> Look, I am here on an official NCIS investigation.<eos> Contact Director Vance.<eos> He give you permission to photograph this government facility?
Murder for money?<eos> Deliberately sending someone into harm's way?<eos> Eliciting others to participate?<eos> Your answers will be particularly worthy of study, because you've committed so many of the crimes on the list.<eos> This morning, you and your team were told the computer lab was closed, due to a maintenance issue.
You may have to be non-traditional in your thinking.<eos> [Walt] Olivia can't make it to school today, but she wanted me to turn in her book report.<eos> Olivia... she's so conscientious.<eos> But why are you dropping it off?<eos> Well, I wanted to ask you a few questions about Olivia's father.
I'll keep an eye on them.<eos> - Is everything okay?<eos> - I... I must've caught a bug.<eos> I should go home.<eos> All right, um, stay here, and I'll get you some tea.
Hey, I see they finally found something you can do.<eos> Oh, you coming to check out your old offices?<eos> - Is it making you feel nostalgic?<eos> - Well, this is an improvement.<eos> Can I get you a drink, ma'am?
I don't think that motivation will be the problem.<eos> The method you're proposing... that's where we may run into trouble.<eos> I was told Rixar Energy was only sending two representatives today.<eos> Forgive us, Ms. Hashemi.<eos> My old friend George may have given you some inaccurate information about our party. Um...
You're not taking anything down.<eos> I need to speak with someone now.<eos> You can speak with me, Mr. Forrest.<eos> I assume you're here to talk about Leonard Bailey.<eos> I'm here to show you this.
This is for you.<eos> What is it?<eos> It's a contract.<eos> I signed it today.<eos> It's my promise that I will donate my kidney to you once my baby is born.
Erica, I appreciate how hard this is for you.<eos> Especially considering... well, would you agree that the defendant, Dr. Robeson, is kind of a jerk?<eos> Objection!<eos> She's trashing her own client.<eos> Are you sure you want to object?
With him gone, I'm a dead woman.<eos> - I can trust nobody.<eos> - I know the feeling well.<eos> Well, I can tell you that I don't trust you.<eos> Well, then you have impeccable instincts.
Dear Mr. Chambers. I have your breakfast.<eos> Ah, wonderful.<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> - A little patience, please, dear lady.<eos> What would you like, Miss Beech?
30 really is the most we can offer.<eos> - I'm not sure you understand the work involved.<eos> - I understand perfectly, but 30 is our limit.<eos> Then we can do no business.<eos> I thank you and your assistant for coming here.
And what is it to you?<eos> I'm not such a fool as to imagine I might stand a chance now that you are so above me.<eos> But don't suppose I'm content to stay a nobody all my life.<eos> One day I will leave you. You can be sure of that.<eos> But for now, I care for you too much to see you go to ruin because of him.
No.<eos> What do you mean, "No"?<eos> You go ahead and do it if you want, but I won't.<eos> Miss MacKenzie. Please have a seat.<eos> We wanna give you an exclusive.
I have the faith and a strong belief.<eos> Revolution, revolution... I will bring revolution on my last day.<eos> Passport, please.<eos> Ma'am could you step out of the line, please?<eos> We need to ask you a couple of questions.
It will only take a day or two to get that paperwork going, and then...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Look, I'm not gonna be able to, at least not right now.<eos> There's been some complications, and I can't...<eos> Look, I'm trying to help you here. Okay?
Oh, ta.<eos> ♪ I'm gonna give you... ♪ Excuse me, could I give you some useful information about using<eos> ~ sheaths to prevent yourself from infection...<eos> ~ Get lost!<eos> Excuse me, could I give you some useful information about using ~ sheaths to prevent yourself from...?
) This is Nurse Gilbert. She's with us at Nonnatus.<eos> I was just explaining to Mrs Mills about the council's new laundry service.<eos> Nurse Crane is very keen that anyone entitled should make good use of it.<eos> May I put your husband down for it, Mrs Mills?<eos> It's free of charge and you can't possibly manage like this at your age.
Elizabeth, remember your duty as a bride is to all your guests.<eos> I've no taste for fighting, Mama.<eos> Are you a fan of the sport, Ross?<eos> Perhaps you'll instruct me in its finer points.<eos> I doubt there are any subtleties of combat on which I can offer you advice, ma'am.
We'd be fucked without that tree.<eos> - It's the only reason people come here.<eos> - Well, they haven't got a lot of choice.<eos> It's the only thing worth putting on a postcard, though.<eos> Well, they could put you on a postcard.
Okay, well, let's cock-thumb.<eos> I really don't care for that term.<eos> - Madam President.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> The prime minister of India has sent you this.
My college friends called me Tall McCartney.<eos> I preferred that.<eos> That's a good nickname.<eos> Fractious cracks have opened up in your relationships and in your testimony and we'll explore them in a later session.<eos> Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you're about to give is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
I'll be right with you.<eos> Who are you?<eos> You're not Mr. Conway.<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> Now I asked you a question.
Why?<eos> I was raised in the faith.<eos> It was arduous for me.<eos> Have you religion?<eos> - Are you offering it?
She enjoys pop music and ice cream and jumping rope.<eos> Well, that's good to know.<eos> Now, you say you attend church occasionally.<eos> Is that because your pastor only preaches occasionally?<eos> Ms. Clara, I really would like to help you sell your house.
Yes, I remember.<eos> How is he?<eos> The man from the square.<eos> Oh, he'll be all right.<eos> At the very least he'll survive, thanks to you.
He recently argued a case before the Supreme Court.<eos> He did?<eos> Oh, you mean this son.<eos> Uh, sure, he's terrific.<eos> Uh, Beverly, would you like to see the math I worked out to support our hypothesis?
To see Dayanand. "That's our brother Bajrangi."<eos> Mister, I don't have change.<eos> Give five rupees to madam.<eos> Madam, please take 5 rupees from him. Hail Lord Ram!<eos> Do you have 5 rupees change, so I can give you 10?
So, are you gonna play or what?<eos> He doesn't remember anything... No family, no home.<eos> All he knew was the last three months.<eos> Everything prior to that was gone.<eos> And did he give you any... any hints about where he might have been, anyone he knew?
Thank you.<eos> You have a nice day.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Allowance?<eos> Your family has you on an allowance?
You told the police about the note, about what I did.<eos> You told them.<eos> What?<eos> Let me go.<eos> Have you any idea what you've done?
- Kurt, right?<eos> - Yes, ma'am.<eos> - Mr. dawes is waiting for you in his office.<eos> - Okay, wonderful.<eos> I'm glad you seem to be doing well.
When I met your daughter I didn't really understand why she was so afraid of you.<eos> Now I do. We're a lot like each other.<eos> Willful.<eos> That's a reason for mutual respect, not fear.<eos> I'm sure you have better things to do with your time than meddle in other people's business.
I know. I know. I'm not exactly your model grieving widow, but Artie and me, it was never...<eos> - Meaning?<eos> - He was a man.<eos> Was he, now?<eos> Did you have keys to the Coffee Hut?
Tell me, Dr. Bloom, does he favour you?<eos> I think I amused him.<eos> Things either amuse him or they don't. And if they don't...<eos> Well, you didn't.<eos> Do you feel he ever genuinely cared for you?
Right.<eos> Where the hell is she?<eos> It's a fairly simple form.<eos> Here you agree, in writing, to never again disclose information regarding your former employer, the dissolved entity known as Union Allied Construction, or any of its affiliates.<eos> Upon execution of this agreement, the corporate interests, as they currently exist, agree not to pursue legal action against you.
Daniel Fisher was murdered and your clients...<eos> I assure you that any illegal activity associated with Union Allied has been dealt with, thanks very much to you.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> If you'd like, you can take these to your own representatives, but I'm fairly certain they'll advise you to sign it.<eos> And as a show of good faith, my clients would like to offer you a lump sum of six months' salary.
Well, funny you should ask.<eos> Someone was religious.<eos> I don't... I don't understand.<eos> He... he's in there? Raymond?<eos> I need to ask you a few questions to help with our investigation. Uh... you were the girlfriend of...
Should've caught it.<eos> He used his middle name.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hang on a second.<eos> Um, thank you.
I-I feel like if I... [ voice breaking ] stay here and keep watching logan,<eos> Todd will come home.<eos> Who would want to hurt my husband?<eos> I don't know, But I will do my best to find out.<eos> Can I ask you a couple questions? Okay.
My name is Strange.<eos> Yours, madam, though you do not know it, is Delgado.<eos> And I am delighted to meet you.<eos> I have a proposal for you, madam.<eos> I am able to give you your heart's desire, and in return you shall give me mine.
I'm sorry. I have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> You had no idea that Josslyn Carver was in bed with your husband last night?<eos> I don't believe that to be true.<eos> You don't believe?<eos> What if I showed you a tape that could prove it were true?
It gets hard as a drum.<eos> Lie down.<eos> Doctor, what's a girl like you doing working in a gym like this?<eos> It is a choice.<eos> Do you give anabolic steroids?
Keep going.<eos> Ma'am, you okay?<eos> Uh, I hurt my ankle.<eos> Which one is it?<eos> All right, we're gonna need you to reach out here, okay?
I'm Ashley Alexander of Ashley Alexander Realty.<eos> I don't like that name.<eos> I would call it Red Door Realty.<eos> Okay. Great.<eos> Can I show you around this lovely home?
I hope you are not implying she would be more powerful than I. Oh, no, indeed.<eos> Mary took Marigold to the Drewes' farm today.<eos> When a woman loves a child, it must stay with her.<eos> As you're aware, this is the day of the Malton Show.<eos> Does it ever occur to you that you might be wrong?
Well, I heard rumors.<eos> But I stay off of social media.<eos> Really?<eos> 'Cause you updated Zoey's cyberbullying page, 20 minutes ago, from your computer.<eos> Like a criminal who gloves up and files a serial number off a gun, you took every cyber precaution to hide yourself.
When you hurt us, we actually do bleed.<eos> I know that that is hard for you to remember, Mr. Mancini, but it is worth trying.<eos> If not for me, then for my daughter.<eos> I, um...<eos> Yes, thank you.
- I left three messages.<eos> He hasn't returned them. If we don't have Cohen, we're in deep shit.<eos> Councilwoman Feraldo.<eos> Detective Paul Sampson, NYPD.<eos> I need to ask you a few questions.
Shame is to meet a woman beautiful as you and not learn her name.<eos> Her name's Mary Fields.<eos> Miss Ellison, ain't you in the wrong place?<eos> Louise Ellison, I'm a journalist covering the railroad.<eos> I was just hoping to ask you a few questions about the man you brought to town this morning.
Yup. But we changed Gertrude's name.<eos> Your cow?<eos> We're calling her "Lizzy" now.<eos> "Lizzy"?<eos> We thought since she was the first cow you ever milked, we should name her after you.
I just read about your place, and I drove out here myself.<eos> And the patient is your... ?<eos> Is my son.<eos> Mm.<eos> Can I ask you a few questions?
I can't...<eos> I can't... can't figure anything out.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Don't do it.<eos> So it can't be used to investigate you, your husband, or your partners.
I could call him in an instant and have you arrested.<eos> I'm just here waiting for my typewriter to be fixed.<eos> Just leave my patients alone.<eos> I feel sorry for you, Mrs. Johnson.<eos> Dr. Masters has brainwashed you.
You're scrappy.<eos> I'm sorry, Mr. Ellis, but the answer is no.<eos> And I haven't even asked you a question yet.<eos> Like I said, scrappy.<eos> Now, what would you say if I told you I could get you your money...
Don't want to miss your plane.<eos> Oh, the plane's not gonna leave without me, Blake.<eos> You know, I had my heart set on the train, actually, but Fred vetoed that with extreme prejudice.<eos> Why do I get the impression you're trying to get rid of me?<eos> Because I'm trying to get rid of you.
I mean, you know, between us girls.<eos> Hello.<eos> Mr. Paaswell.<eos> I know-- I'm not supposed to be here. Forgot one thing.<eos> Uh, why don't I show you the garden?
No, the Army will detonate it someplace where it can't hurt anyone.<eos> When the Axis sees what we're capable of, they'll have no choice. They will have to surrender...<eos> For how long?<eos> Your husband is at another site proving his loyalty to his country.<eos> You can help him by proving that you can be a discreet, productive member of this community.
Hello, Daisy.<eos> Daisy was one of those dangerous types.<eos> She isn't anymore.<eos> Is there a point to this excursion, Dr. Vose?<eos> When you consigned your sister to my care, you gave me full authority to decide whether she is well enough to be released, if at all.
She's not responsible for her actions.<eos> Be that as it may, Julia.<eos> It makes her no less dangerous.<eos> Rose, may we speak with you for a moment?<eos> Miss Maxwell, we need to ask you some questions.
She wouldn't have risked losing that chance.<eos> She loves me.<eos> Rose... can I see the key your brother Cedric gave you?<eos> He didn't give me anything.<eos> Miss Maxwell, your brother told me he gave you a key so you could escape from this door.
I'm gonna give you something for the pain.<eos> Oh, this won't hurt a bit. Good.<eos> [screams]<eos> Damn...<eos> Doc says he'll let you know when he's ready.
Not yet, but at least we're hearing some interesting conversation from those two book clubs.<eos> Well, we thought The Heaven Lover's Club was rich and spiritual.<eos> We thought it was maybe a little slow.<eos> Oh, well, maybe I can liven it up for ya!<eos> Let me help you up.
I'm going to do what I must to report this and bring this to light. I'm going to reveal this to the whole wide world.<eos> I'm going to reveal everything.<eos> Now that I'm aware of the truth, I can't keep quiet about this as a reporter.<eos> I'm going to report the connection between you and Chairman Park.<eos> Do you actually think that I'm just going to sit back and let you do that?
But don't worry.<eos> I won't be eavesdropping.<eos> Why would I?<eos> I have a book.<eos> Can I get you a drink, or should we wait for your date?
- There's that, yes, but...<eos> - Heroin's his drug of choice.<eos> What did he take?<eos> - He's over 18, ma'am.<eos> I can't tell you any more than I could tell the police.
- that knows who killed her.<eos> - No associates listed, but I do have Susan Watts' address.<eos> - Can I help you?<eos> - Detective Beckett, NYPD.<eos> I need to ask you a few questions about Susan Watts.
Gretchen Cutler?<eos> Who wants to know?<eos> Detective Beckett, NYPD.<eos> This is Mr. Castle.<eos> We need to ask you a few questions about your son.
Your, um, husband has multiple rib fractures, and there's evidence that there's blood in his belly.<eos> He's gonna need exploratory surgery to see how extensive the damage is.<eos> Okay. Uh, okay.<eos> Um, thank you.<eos> Mrs. Davis, we need to ask you some questions.
Whatever happened to you is nothing compared to what I'm gonna do to the other guy.<eos> Mr. Archie Bronstein?<eos> The Savannah Hammer.<eos> No case too small, no settlement too big.<eos> Now, what can I help you with?
I tried once, to see my mother.<eos> They shot her, so...<eos> Anyway, I did my job.<eos> Why did you quit?<eos> How did you get them to let you quit?
I'm fine with giving you those names.<eos> I'm fine...<eos> I'm fine with what happened to those people, if it means you're gonna win... I'm fine with it.<eos> But you need to tell me everything, Mrs. Grant.<eos> You need to tell me exactly what happened with Mr. Bainbridge so I can do my job and make sure you win.
- I know you didn't.<eos> You're welcome, by the way.<eos> Hey, where you going?<eos> No place.<eos> Can I buy you a drink?
We still do.<eos> - Really?<eos> Coz everything you've given me... is either information I already know... or would've undoubtedly found out... Or was just plain... - untrue.<eos> - And what about your end of the deal?<eos> You said you'd get rid of my competitors.
They're taking him into theatre.<eos> How could your husband, a disturbed man, gain possession of a gun?<eos> I can't understand it.<eos> Oh, if anything happens to George, I would...<eos> Let's find you a change of clothes.
I'd better get on.<eos> - I shouldn't get involved.<eos> - No.<eos> And you don't like to get involved in helping others, do you?<eos> I'm trying to help you.
I'd better go. I don't want to miss those pigs.<eos> You're not a quick learner, are you?<eos> I don't know what you mean, Mrs Patmore.<eos> I'm only thinking of you. Just be sensible, for heaven's sake.<eos> Does it ever occur to you that just this once you might be wrong?
Your Ladyship, I have no wish to sound ungrateful.<eos> This is a fine house.<eos> And Mr Carson's right.<eos> It would be an honour to hold our party here.<eos> But it's not what you want.
I know.<eos> He sent word after. Through you.<eos> He knew you'd be watching.<eos> I don't like having the fbi running my prints, Accessing my covert files, Talking with my former co.<eos> When I saw that happening, I knew it meant one of two things. You either want to arrest me, or talk to me.
Is that the interface?<eos> You don't know how it works.<eos> If you trust him, agent keen, You'll show it to me.<eos> It's what he wants.<eos> He gave you a key?
No-one told me you were coming<eos> - and I'm afraid Lord Merton's out.<eos> - It's you I've come to see.<eos> How flattering.<eos> - May I offer you anything?
Hm. I guess I could think of worse reason to kill 100 million bees.<eos> The-the-the short, nubby arcades in the N's.<eos> Look at the bold garlands.<eos> Same hand, no question.<eos> Not what you wanted to hear, is it?
Ah, well, I will miss you, too.<eos> Will you be visiting us soon?<eos> Probably not.<eos> Dr. Hamza, can I talk to you for just one second?<eos> I just wanted to wish you the very best for your retirement.
Hopefully you'll never have to find out.<eos> Try again.<eos> Kirsten.<eos> Clark.<eos> I'm afraid I can't let you access the box unless the signatures match.
Look, I just want to say, even if I don't get the position that this was the best job interview ever.<eos> Penelope Garcia.<eos> You're marvelous.<eos> She's marvelous.<eos> Agent Lewis, I believe I asked you to wait and that was about 36 hours ago.
Came in with it.<eos> I hear you've had a busy night yourself.<eos> Yes.<eos> Mrs Bligh.<eos> I was going to leave you a message.
I'll show you your room.<eos> Please come.<eos> Mr. Singhania is really happy that you accepted his invitation.<eos> But he's also apologized.<eos> He couldn't receive you personally because he was busy in his meetings.
What?<eos> Theo's been missing for two days.<eos> His brother was here earlier looking for him.<eos> May I?<eos> It looks like Theo sent you a text two days ago.
I'm... I'm sorry, I don't understand.<eos> He was friends with Eli.<eos> Brian wouldn't kill him.<eos> Maybe not the Brian you know, but if he's using, then he isn't that person anymore.<eos> Agent Harris, let me ask you a question.
Huh. Really good, guys, really good.<eos> I mean... great work with USAID.<eos> Not easy.<eos> But I do have a queasy feeling that we may owe them something.<eos> Um, ma'am, you have a three-hour dinner next week with Candice Templeton.
Kara?<eos> Oh, I was so scared.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Thanks to the boss.<eos> If I let you drown, I'd never hear the end of it from her.
Like you did in Posta.<eos> I feel like we're doing most of the talking here, so if you want to jump in, that'd be helpful.<eos> You survived the massacre.<eos> You and Catalina.<eos> The general let you live, and you gave him a son, Gabriel.
What store?<eos> On it.<eos> Do I need to remind you that you're not the victim here?<eos> I don't appreciate being treated like a criminal.<eos> Well, maybe you should have thought about that before you tried to stab me with a weapon I'm guessing you used to kill Zac Romero.
I don't appreciate being treated like a criminal.<eos> Well, maybe you should have thought about that before you tried to stab me with a weapon I'm guessing you used to kill Zac Romero.<eos> You seriously think I would kill my own husband?<eos> Yeah, about that.<eos> We can't find any record of marriage between you two, only a restraining order that Zac filed against you.
Six figure salary, million dollar apartment...<eos> - He's a generous man.<eos> - He is a killer.<eos> And you know it.<eos> Whose side are you on?
Oh, don't be.<eos> It was the times.<eos> If you were single, you couldn't get a credit card or even rent an apartment without your father cosigning the lease.<eos> Only 40 years ago, but it was another world back then... a world Frank helped change.<eos> Do you have any idea what it was like to meet a man like that in 1973, someone who took my intellect as seriously as any man's, someone who marched, who made it his life's work to help women?
His son was less inclined to support my schooling.<eos> Well, Ms. James, I can't hire you back as a cleaner.<eos> I understand.<eos> But if I had an assistant who I could rely on...<eos> I haven't spoken to the city, so I don't know what I could offer you in terms of a salary,
Oh, Dr. Charles, good.<eos> Could I get a consult?<eos> I need to get this splint on her, but she won't sit still.<eos> I'm late, and we're still 30 minutes away from Fort Lauderdale.<eos> Ms. Francis, I am so sorry to hold you up, but do you mind if I ask you a couple of questions?
Hello? Oh, Mrs. Florrick, how are you?<eos> You must be in Springfield.<eos> Yes, sorry it's so loud.<eos> Oh, I hear it's going well.<eos> I'm really happy for you and your husband.
Am I a little kid?<eos> Good night.<eos> This is the day, man.<eos> Madam, the gentleman has vacated the room.<eos> He asked me to give this cover to you.
I-I was not digging through your desk.<eos> Well, I was, but only to write you an apology, and now that it appears I've broken into your office, there are two things I need to apologize for.<eos> Damn it! Oh, no.<eos> No.<eos> Th-Th-The cafeteria ladies in the student union will give you a bag of ice and a pinch so your milk doesn't go bad.
- on electroplating facilities?<eos> - Yes, sir. There's only one electroplating factory in Toronto.<eos> We actually had cause to visit there on another case some years ago.<eos> You may recall the name of the factory owner was James Kirkham.<eos> Right, Doctor, we'll leave you to figure out how the girl died.
- [laughs] Yeah, I would be, too.<eos> There were no entire bones that were found, but at least a fragment or more of almost every bone below the neck was recovered in that burn pit.<eos> [Fallon] Did you find evidence of any human bone identified as being collected from a site other than the burn pit behind the defendant's garage?<eos> [Eisenberg] Human bone also was collected from what was designated "burn barrel number two."<eos> Now, you did offer an opinion that you believe the location for the primary burning episode was the burn pit behind the defendant's garage, is that correct?
The reviews for your show were terrific, but...<eos> Perhaps if you would let me speak, things would be clearer.<eos> So, when did you arrive?<eos> Six months, almost.<eos> I don't know why Rasmussen gave you my number, but I'm happy he did.
My man on the street tells me that the Soviet ambassador's in town this week.<eos> In the interest of peace through culture, I donate this painting to the people of the Soviet Union.<eos> The Purple Onion. 9:30.<eos> Joan Crawford has a dinner reservation.<eos> Miss Crawford, in recognition of your cinematic craft, we bestow this painting on you.
If you use it for any length of time, your teeth just go all to hell.<eos> And that's the good part.<eos> So listen, this thing that happened to your husband, how can I help you?<eos> Mr. Sportello, I don't think Coy is really dead.<eos> Well, did you ID his body?
You can have mine.<eos> - Please.<eos> - Take mine!<eos> Hey, hey, hey!<eos> I'd love to accompany you.
Thank you. - Cheers.<eos> - Congratulations.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> So, I...<eos> I got to ask you, how can you stand to be in the same room as some of these people?
Is she alive?<eos> Did she live?<eos> Here's my card.<eos> You can telephone me any time you want.<eos> And thank you.
- Ah! Forget my fate. - Ah!<eos> Forget my fate<eos> A song of lost love.<eos> Indeed.<eos> I thank you.
Could you fix me gas fire?<eos> I'll have a go.<eos> You're not like the other men from the Gas Board.<eos> Well, that's because, see, I'm not really from the Gas Board.<eos> But I can tell you, that I think you've been cut off.
Should I be ringing a lawyer?<eos> (Knock at door) Mrs Vasilich, I'm Detective Senior Sergeant Andy Campbell and we have a warrant for your arrest and we have a search warrant.<eos> You do not have to say anything, but anything you do say may be used in evidence against you.<eos> Do you understand that?<eos> When did you have that dry-cleaned?
I wanted to see you on Monday...<eos> - We could...<eos> - I'm talking to Mrs Bya!<eos> Forgive me.<eos> I've nothing against you but I have to deal with competition from Asian solar panels.
A new life.<eos> I could do that for you.<eos> Why on earth would you?<eos> Because I know what it is to be judged unfairly.<eos> And because it's just possible that, while I am uniquely situated to offer you your freedom, you may be able to do the same for me.
Don't you worry about a thing, I'll get you out of this.<eos> Oh.<eos> "Dear Mr Holmes, my name is Bainbridge. "<eos> "I'm a Private in Her Majesty's Household Guard. "<eos> "I'm writing to you about a personal matter... "
- Okay?<eos> How's it going?<eos> He's getting it.<eos> You should sign that.<eos> The newspapers are going to be tough on you.
How can I understand?<eos> You won't tell me anything.<eos> I didn't even know he wasn't with his squad.<eos> I'm so sorry, I can't say more.<eos> But I would like to present you with this Medal of Valor... and if you look closely on the back, there's a number.
I was lonely, Mr Irish.<eos> I've never had sex like that before.<eos> Sure. Did you only meet Robbie the one time?<eos> After we left The Snug, we went back to his place.<eos> And the blackmail was to gag you on the waterfront corruption.
I'll hold on to it if you're just gonna throw it away.<eos> Ballard.<eos> Special agent Terrence Ballard.<eos> Agent Ballard, let's just sit tight a minute.<eos> Why don't you just tell your lieutenant that FBI is here?
He's being destroyed by an unjust process.<eos> If they get him to the States, they'll get him to say whatever they want him to.<eos> Hold the line, would you, please?<eos> Miss, I've got an Elizabeth Forester from the US Embassy.<eos> Says she'd like to speak to you and that she could save you a lot of effort.
Previously on Pretty Little Liars... - It's Mona.<eos> - "Hanna won, so Mona loses."<eos> Mona might be safe, but that doesn't mean she's not on on this.<eos> We're dropping the charges against you.
Miss Ives.<eos> What an unexpected pleasure.<eos> Have you an interest in botany?<eos> All I really seem to know about plants is how to kill them.<eos> Then let me show you something extraordinary.
You don't care for him?<eos> Not as much as he'd like.<eos> My God, you don't think I'm something to do with it?<eos> Well, I think you made quite a spectacle of yourself on The Broad yesterday.<eos> Perhaps feel you didn't make your point strongly enough?
We didn't discuss her business much.<eos> But you must've been aware of her success.<eos> You... you traveled together to Bali, Brussels, Paris, Turkey, Greece... all in the span of one year.<eos> We traveled a lot.<eos> And never in that time did she introduce you to her boss, Kubra Balik?
Vitamins. Just vitamins.<eos> Was Dr. Henri your doctor?<eos> Yes. We have his letter confirming that if she is on the list of athletes he said he supplied doping products to, it's a mistake.<eos> You'll get a copy after the press conference.<eos> Was he referred to you by another athlete? No.
Well... less than expected, actually.<eos> That's fine, Ms Lantham. Thanks.<eos> You have a lovely view here.<eos> You must be a man worth knowing.<eos> Do you mind if I ask you... a personal question?
Four minutes after, he is the same.<eos> But this time, you see what he is carrying?<eos> This is the report Mr Bloom gave to you saying Shlomo Zahary has links with Hezbollah.<eos> Because of this, you did not give him your contract.<eos> And this is the one Zahary gave to you to be proving his innocence.
No!<eos> Baby seems completely unperturbed.<eos> What about my mother?<eos> The sedative I've given her will help.<eos> Not least because it means I can ask you some questions.
I have done my utmost to persuade you to end it in a dignified fashion, but you seem determined to ignore me.<eos> As a result, you have been humiliated.<eos> I had hoped you would come to realise that financial gain is the most likely motive for this boy's... apparent... infatuation.<eos> That is a despicable suggestion.<eos> And yet, this morning, I saw him receiving money from you with my own eyes.
I want him behind bars, where he belongs.<eos> If Edgerton admits to being blackmailed,<eos> Loxley will be thoroughly discredited and Harry will be in the clear.<eos> The truth must come out.<eos> And it's down to you, Miss Hawkins.
Oh, you're... you're leaving? Mm-hm.<eos> There's nothing like a deadline to sharpen the mind.<eos> Speaking of which, when is your wedding?<eos> Erm... we haven't set a date yet.<eos> I must say, I'm surprised you would give this all up.
That's the law.<eos> I know that.<eos> In the meantime, they're under my care - all of them, Vivian included.<eos> The police were going to send her to Minda.<eos> But now thanks to you she thinks she can get away with anything.
Erm...someone told a lie to help a dead man's family, and I didn't stand up for the truth.<eos> No.<eos> You've done worse than that.<eos> We'll work well together only when you can be completely honest with me.<eos> I'll let you get some rest.
Look.<eos> It's tough in here, on anyone.<eos> They told me about what happened to your food.<eos> Maybe you could make sure that you only eat stuff out of a sealed wrapper.<eos> They said that you requested a piano keyboard.
What, what we're doing now?<eos> No-one appears to be stopping us.<eos> No, but...<eos> Look, you've been badly shaken by the attack.<eos> Maybe it's best I come when you're feeling better.
What was the order?<eos> "Don't hurt Denton."<eos> I'm sorry about your mum.<eos> Thanks.<eos> We're going to show you CCTV captured on the evening of the 16th of August.
I just always wondered if I was lucky.<eos> But now I realise they... they must've known<eos> I had nothing to do with it, and... they planned to let me go.<eos> So you were known to them.<eos> They could have used you to track the convoy.
My mum gave it to me.<eos> Lucky you.<eos> I don't think it's anything special.<eos> It's just a cheap one.<eos> I meant that you have a mum that gives you nice things.
I saw you kissing Dr. Sanders in the street.<eos> I was just... thanking him for his help with Kenny.<eos> From what I saw, you were very, very thankful.<eos> Are you gonna tell Lucinda?<eos> Not if you let Mr. Kenneth get the help he needs. Fine.
I saw you kissing Dr. Sanders in the street.<eos> I was just... thanking him for his help with Kenny.<eos> From what I saw, you were very, very thankful.<eos> Are you gonna tell Lucinda?<eos> Not if you let Mr. Kenneth get the help he needs. Fine.
I'll assume you mean "cross-examination," Mr. Deane.<eos> Yes, Alex.<eos> Thank you for that.<eos> (Alex) Continue, Counselor.<eos> So, Ms. Marks, you understood when you taped the conversation between yourself and the-- the j-juror in your daughter's case that you were committing a felony?
Again, it's just procedure.<eos> It's fine.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Well, I'm coming with you.<eos> Actually, I need to ask you a few questions, and then you can join your husband down at the station.
Prostitution, three hours sounds about right.<eos> Eileen Brenner?<eos> - That's right.<eos> - N.Y.P.D.<eos> I'd like to ask you a few questions about Donald Grant.
- Who's we?<eos> - Who?<eos> Miss Warren, you've spent your fair share of time in Psych.<eos> You have a history of violent outbursts.<eos> The incident with inmate Waterstone in which you broke her collarbone.
Well, if you ask me, the problem is Lee Berman.<eos> Before he got on the city council, the bypass was totally stalled.<eos> Yeah, that's true.<eos> But don't worry about Lee Berman.<eos> I'm gonna help you maneuver this, and I'll pull some strings when I'm able to.
Oh, yeah, uh, 2014 Ocean... something.<eos> It's--it's right on the water.<eos> Is there anything else you can tell us about Perez?<eos> Just that he'd probably kill me if he knew I was talking to you.<eos> Has he threatened you before?
That's an armed camp. There are two of us.<eos> How do you think we're gonna get in?<eos> Place that in the other room.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Congratulations on you and your husband's new position as Chief of Staff. Compliments of Commander Allenford.
I was wondering if you would be willing to help me out with my application to Pratt.<eos> I really need a letter of recommendation.<eos> And I know we just got started, but it would be so amazing if you would consider writing me one.<eos> Um, I really don't have much to go on.<eos> I know, which is why maybe I could help you out at your studio.
Turn in your equations, and you will get a frog.<eos> Dissect carefully, because inside the frog is the name of the city council member who you will be e-mailing to restart construction.<eos> - Ms. Day? - Yes.<eos> I thought this was gonna be a disaster.<eos> But thanks to you, I can go upstairs to the big boys and tell them they can always depend... on Dr. Alan Foster.
But, uh, we were totally rooting' for you.<eos> Team Tallulah all the way.<eos> She got screwed by the judges in the lip-synching.<eos> I know, right?<eos> Anyway... Uh, we came here to ask you some questions about a Tiffany Lamp?
Excuse me.<eos> Are you Barbara Keyes?<eos> Whatever you selling, I ain't buying.<eos> Actually, my name is Erin Reagan, with the district attorney's office.<eos> I was hoping I could ask you a few questions.
No.<eos> Of course not.<eos> My car has leather seats.<eos> You also have a healthy, beautiful baby girl... who deserves a sibling.<eos> Now, which one of those two problems would you like to focus on?
Are you shocked?<eos> Do you have any evidence to prove I was there?<eos> Sure we do... not for long.<eos> Are you accusing me?<eos> No, I'm only inviting you to ask questions.
I am clearly too much of a distraction.<eos> These appear to be inconsistent with the damage caused by both the... shovel and the blade.<eos> Excellent work yet again, Mr. Bray.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You should call one of the other interns to help you.
What kind of a thing?<eos> I'm going to an A.A. meeting.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah, really.<eos> Ms. Hobbs, isn't it true that your show, The Morning Gauntlet, was put on constructive notice after eight different people filed formal complaints against you?
How about after the crash?<eos> No.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Yes.<eos> Detective, I feel compelled to remind you that you are under oath here.
Ms. Galecki, it's Detective Reagan.<eos> Can you open the door, please?<eos> Hello, Detectives. Ma'am.<eos> Is everything all right?<eos> We need to ask you some questions.
Here.<eos> Oh, these are your messages, and Julian Bruckner is waiting in your office.<eos> And who is this?<eos> NYPD.<eos> We need to ask you a few questions, Ms. King.
They didn't appreciate my honesty.<eos> No matter.<eos> Orals are an antiquated useless tradition meant to make professors feel superior.<eos> If I were an insurance company,<eos> I would give you a policy for free.
All his charity, all of his missionary work, the hours and hours he spends helping out his parishioners...<eos> So you don't think that was genuine.<eos> He just wants everyone to think he's a great guy.<eos> Gets off on the pats on his back.<eos> Well, he obviously helped you turn your life around.
Detective Brian Lucas.<eos> I'm afraid I've got some bad news.<eos> Oh, my God, this can't be happening.<eos> I know, it's a shock.<eos> We do have a few questions to ask you, though, okay?
- No.<eos> - No? - You are going to love this.<eos> - It's a little on the loud side, guys.<eos> How about putting a sock around the ball?<eos> - Oh. - We're going to put this on you.
Him behind me.<eos> I was on my side at first.<eos> Tied up.<eos> What else?<eos> Can you see him clearly?
Objection.<eos> Argumentative.<eos> He literally had knife to my throat.<eos> Objection.<eos> Are you saying he was threatening you?
I'll send a unit to pick her up.<eos> Great.<eos> Thanks for coming in, Ms. Miller.<eos> I'm Detective Beckett.<eos> I just need to ask you a few questions about...
That was awesome.<eos> He farted so much.<eos> Okay, look, obviously, we don't really know these people, so let's keep things fun and positive and celebratory, and merger-y.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> Hello, Mrs. DeMarco, I am Leslie Knope, and we saw your announcement in the newspaper and we would love to treat you and your husband to a very special day.
Why waste time arguing about small battles, when we could be discussing the larger war?<eos> Perhaps you and I have more in common than you think.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> I want the machine to be free. You wanna control it.<eos> I won't bore you with academic theories about competing civilizations.
She says, "I'll never see my daughter again."<eos> There are people who won't get back any part of their sons and their brothers and their husbands.<eos> They won't get back anything from the life before.<eos> But you have children.<eos> You have a home, you have so much more than most.
This young girl's brave last act did not save her life, but it did catch her killer.<eos> Here's the thing about DNA... whatever you touch, whether you pick up a soda can, or a garden hose, you leave a small trace of yourself.<eos> A small trace of your DNA.<eos> There, I just left a small trace of my DNA.<eos> Now, ma'am, if you were to touch it in the same place, a small trace of my cells may end up on you.
What? When can I... start work?<eos> Yes. You want to work here? I do.<eos> Uh, um, now.<eos> I'm... Tomorrow, if you'd like.<eos> Good. Uh, come on back in, and I'll assign you a desk.
- Hello.<eos> I'd like you to meet my husbands,<eos> Cyrus and Jermaine. They're even more handsome than your last two husbands.<eos> Thank you, Madame ex-Mayor.<eos> So, Ambassador Tennety, we'll let you wash off some of that road dust, and then we'll go for a tour of the mines.
When it was all over, my guy was still alive.<eos> I told him to his face, I said, "Frank, you're a hero."<eos> He said, "Boss, I'm just doing my job."<eos> When can I talk to him?<eos> I wish I could make him available to you, I just can't.
I'm sorry.<eos> - Can I help you?<eos> - I was wondering if the bar is open.<eos> Uh... yeah.<eos> - Come over, I'll show you.
Do you speak French'?<eos> Just as good as they do in France, yeah.<eos> Al 12h15, your son was in the cafeteria with four other residents, when a fire broke out.<eos> Little Kevin Julien was rushed to the hospital, burned to the second, if not third degree.<eos> Want me to draw you a picture too'?
Ma'am, you need to stop.<eos> You're disturbing the whole block.<eos> Mike, you gotta come down!<eos> Mike!<eos> All right, ma'am, listen, I don't want to have to write you a summons, okay?
What is that supposed to mean?<eos> That I'm too old to get pregnant?<eos> And that's registering as a truthful statement.<eos> Well, the joke's on you, lie detector, because I am pregnant.<eos> Oh, congratulations to you and your husband.
With nudity.<eos> I'd watch that. Seriously?<eos> Wow.<eos> That is something coming from Victoria Chase.<eos> May I say something to you also in confidence?
I love Emmet so much and I don't even know if he's alive.<eos> Can't you just give me something?<eos> I can't comment on the case.<eos> I understand.<eos> But I can ask you a question.
I think today's the day. Today, sir?<eos> I have let this go on long enough.<eos> Today, sergeant.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Yes, ma'am, I heard every word you said.
Even if it threatens the last memory of your father?<eos> Your prints... were not a match.<eos> I'm not surprised. How about a ride home?<eos> I'll call a car.<eos> Emily, that ex-husband of yours has it out for you.
She told me all about you.<eos> Your kind are little better than whores.<eos> That's enough.<eos> Your entire family is passing itself off as something it's not.<eos> I mean, do you even have the faintest idea who you're talking to?
They're from my fiancé.<eos> - Since when?<eos> - Since this morning.<eos> Why didn't you tell me?<eos> You didn't give me a chance.
Painting, love.<eos> View, love.<eos> Pillow, hate.<eos> That's why they call it a throw pillow.<eos> Can I interest you in a Cinnamon Toast-Tini with actual crushed-up Cinnamon Toast?
. What do you think you're doing?<eos> . Earning myself some money.<eos> I never had any luck with the lottery.<eos> When everyone else has big-ass condos and BMWs, why should I live like this?<eos> Ms. CHOl, I have you to thank for this.
I think we can bring this community back from the brink, get those walking abominations judged, and then... well, then, hallelujah.<eos> Judged?<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> Mustn't spill the beans till the end is nigh.<eos> I'd like to show you something very special, if I may.
Can we come in?<eos> We just have a couple questions for you.<eos> I-I-I-I'm sorry.<eos> I wish I could help you, but... my lawyer advised me not to speak to the police.<eos> We know about the note, Mrs. Harbach... the one your husband left instructing you to speak with David Hertzberg.
I just have a few questions.<eos> Kate. They can help.<eos> I understand investigating this case Puts you in a terribly difficult position.<eos> But I need to talk to you about mr.<eos> Outside of his family, You're the one who knew him best.
Yes. It was for our honeymoon.<eos> Turned over the $10,000 that was left in the dumpster.<eos> It's the same money that castle withdrew.<eos> That's not possible.<eos> That's because you're locked into Your own version of events, But, detective, I can show you those bills,
Okay, Kendall, cover the body, and, uh, have the coroner's van back up to the tent.<eos> I don't want anyone gawking at this girl on her way to the morgue.<eos> Yes, who is it?<eos> It's the police, ma'am.<eos> We'd like to ask you a few questions.
I have business with him.<eos> Call him and see.<eos> You're out after curfew.<eos> You offer money.<eos> You have a gun.
All right, moving on.<eos> Where were you last night?<eos> My daughter's gymnastics meet in Nyack.<eos> Not killing Christa Chase, obviously, that's why you're here.<eos> Look, can you... explain the assault charge that Christa filed against you?
Your vital signs are very erratic, senorita.<eos> I have a heart condition. Myocarditis.<eos> I-I lost my nitrate medication.<eos> Very well.<eos> I can get you something.
Feels like we're done here. Thank you, Detectives.<eos> I don't believe that.<eos> You think she's lying?<eos> No, I'm talking about her hair extensions. You really can't tell.<eos> Detective, can I ask you a few questions?
Ms. Lockhart, do you remember seeing him for the first time?<eos> - Turn her over.<eos> - Hit her hard!<eos> I remember he was holding his daughter.<eos> You saved her life.
Mrs. Winter, your shift ended nearly an hour ago.<eos> Oh, I'm just getting a jump on tomorrow's shift.<eos> Well, that's a refreshing attitude.<eos> You never told me what brought you to our clinic.<eos> I understand you had your pick of assignments.
Yes, I'm told that you once administered 100 lashes upon 100 lashes to a poor Highlander boy.<eos> A poor Highlander boy?<eos> If I take your meaning, that boy is a wanted thief and murderer.<eos> I was told he'd merely stolen a loaf of bread.<eos> Did Dougal MacKenzie tell you that?
I-I know I'm not supposed to ask, but are you going to grant asylum?<eos> You're right.<eos> You're not supposed to ask.<eos> Anyway, she's in the back.<eos> Can I get you anything?
We spy on everybody, dummy, we just don't advertise it.<eos> They have no standing army, and their biggest export is false teeth.<eos> They literally have no bite.<eos> Where are we on the security assessment?<eos> Munsey is on his way to brief you.
This place was in quite a state when I took it on.<eos> Well, you've done a good job with it.Thank you.<eos> Only the garden to tackle now.<eos> Do you take sugar, Mr Whicher?<eos> I could help you, if you like.
Yeah, I know.<eos> It was a bomb. If it had been a methane explosion, It would've been uniform and omnidirectional.<eos> You lied to me, but that's what you do, right?<eos> This whole project is one big lie told to 600 people.<eos> I wanna show you something.
That's a flagrant ethics violation, Madeline.<eos> And it could sink you.<eos> Fine, you're right. But you can't prove that.<eos> It's just your word against mine.<eos> Ooh, actually, it's your word against you.
Was there a question in there somewhere?<eos> Why are you stonewalling us, Ms. Lange?<eos> You have to at least pretend to give me advice.<eos> You are my attorney.<eos> But every time I give you advice, you ignore me.
Now there's another attack and she pushes him to his death on a busy road.<eos> There is... a pattern.<eos> If that's what you think, then why are you here?<eos> Mrs. Bates, I hope we've not left our manners outside the prison gates.<eos> Of course, your stepfather didn't bring a charge against you.
He was 35.<eos> We lasted two weeks, I ended up on the streets.<eos> Look at me now, I'm living back with my mum again.<eos> -I'm not saying... -Did your mum... used to invite men back into your flat and then let them do whatever they liked, to both of you, when you was a kid?<eos> While she's so off her face most of the time, she barely knew you was even there... let alone that she was supposed to be protecting you?
Thanks, buddy. Keep the change.<eos> Thank you for sitting down.<eos> This is just pro forma, okay?<eos> We have to talk to everyone.<eos> How would you categorize your relationship with Ryan McQuaid?
- Yet you didn't.<eos> What else... are you hiding?<eos> I didn't want to corrupt my analysis ... analysis which I'd done before I knew who it was.<eos> - I-I barely knew him.<eos> - You saved his life.
And if you're lucky, you will too.<eos> Yeah...<eos> I don't know what that means.<eos> Mrs. Wheeler.<eos> Not to be a downer, but are you sure you can trust this guy?
It's mine.<eos> Everything I got.<eos> Where is everybody?<eos> It's your circus.<eos> Well, I'm glad to see that you're feeling better.
- George, I am prepared to face the charges.<eos> - Yes, and you no doubt will.<eos> And I do hope you triumph.<eos> But in the meantime, the Detective needs you.<eos> Dr. Ogden, is there anything else I can get for you in the meantime?
- No, it sounds badass.<eos> What's next?<eos> Marjorie Reed, 88, stage IV small cell cancer of the lung<eos> - with mets to the liver. - Marjorie, how you doing now?<eos> She says her stomach hurts, but I think she's doing better, thanks to you.
Oh, God. Me neither.<eos> Nearly all of these wounds are perimortem.<eos> So we can rule out turtles.<eos> Please swab and clean the bones as quickly as possible, Ms. Warren.<eos> And you'll assist?
I thought we agreed that you were leaving.<eos> Well, I had a thought about the case.<eos> You're not on the case.<eos> Actually, I was thinking about you.<eos> I was wondering if I could buy you a drink.
(Finch) Unfortunately, that's not our only problem.<eos> What is it, Harry?<eos> Ms. Shaw is gone.<eos> Where?<eos> I can only imagine that she's come to help you and John with the numbers.
This report says exactly what the White House wants it to say.<eos> Jackson told you as much.<eos> I know.<eos> But I can't put my name on a falsified document.<eos> Mr. Jackson also gave you a day.
He lost him.<eos> Alex Kincaid?<eos> The man escaped from his lab.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Alex was helping you?
Come on.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, we will now be re-screening Paris flight 8247. Why screen us twice?<eos> It's not like any of us have gone anywhere.<eos> I know, but it only took a minute.<eos> Miss, can I give you a hand?
Colonel Fuentes...<eos> I wonder if I might ask a favor, as one enemy of corruption to another.<eos> I'm listening.<eos> I'm interested in any information you have on the other signatories on that account.<eos> I will deliver the results to you personally.
I know bad acting when I see it.<eos> This is you, Ms. Kingsley, following Lance hours before he was killed.<eos> I was not following him.<eos> He asked me to meet with him.<eos> And he told you to wear a disguise?
He got hooked.<eos> You kicked him out?<eos> He was stealing things, trading them for more pills.<eos> I-I had to.<eos> Mrs. Flynn, did you have anything to do with what happened last night?
- Ha-ha-ha!<eos> - Oof.<eos> Sam, Sam.<eos> No, she's good, she's good.<eos> My friends and I, uh, would like to buy you a drink.
That is correct.<eos> Next is Aarestrup, Emil.<eos> A Danish author close influenced by the poetry of Heinrich Heine.<eos> Heine, H. That´s for later.<eos> Miss Kampusch, how did you managed to escape your kidnapper?
It's only my first day.<eos> Give me some time.<eos> That's not funny, honey.<eos> We got a lot of work to do around here, okay?<eos> We don't got time to be happy. So how can I help you, Miss Adams?
When your mother wakes up, will you tell her I'm at the theater?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> I'm sure you're very tired.<eos> I can help you feel comfortable if you decide to stay. Good night.
Miss Taylor.<eos> - Yeah? - I'm Dr. Banks.<eos> Oh, they said I might have a concussion, but I don't have to stay here for that, right?<eos> We have to wait for the CT scan results to know that.<eos> I have a couple of questions for you.
Help me.<eos> Call somebody.<eos> Help me.<eos> Did he hit you?<eos> Did he threaten you?
Now, where is Mr. Disney?<eos> I should so much like to get this started and finished as briskly as is humanly possible.<eos> Perhaps someone could point me in his direction.<eos> I'd be so grateful. Thank you.<eos> We were hoping to give you a little tour of the studio.
Don't.<eos> Are you all right, Mrs.?<eos> Mrs. Travers?<eos> Mrs. Travers.<eos> We were saying we'd like to play you the song in the bank.
He bought me nice things, took me nice places, and he was always hot for it.<eos> But I am sure you remember that, don't you?<eos> Did... Was Dennis having trouble at work before he...<eos> Not that I know of.<eos> Can I ask you, did he leave you well taken care of?
That's what he said.<eos> Yes?<eos> Well, keep looking.<eos> Mrs. Kemmal, we've learned that your nephew has escaped. Has run away from the place where he was being looked after.<eos> Has he sent you anything recently?
Your job is to respond to any crime scene or crisis that seems likely to involve an emotionally disturbed person.<eos> - You know how to use a gun?<eos> - Not a cop.<eos> What's your problem?<eos> I don't know, you tell me, doc, you're the psychiatrist.
Which means you won.<eos> Her hold on him will weaken... eventually.<eos> In the meantime, focus on what's important.<eos> You have your health.<eos> You have money to pay your bills and someone who adores you.
Is it more or less than the last administration?<eos> Is it spent through governments or NGOs?<eos> I don't know, but it killed my son.<eos> Oh, well, I'm sorry to hear that.<eos> I-I'd be happy to help you pursue some kind of recompense, uh...
Sue, did the president call?<eos> - Ma'am, he did, actually.<eos> - What?<eos> - en: Madam Vice President. - Huh?<eos> POTUS has noticed your .9% and he's giving you an enhanced role
Now she's dead.<eos> Care to comment?<eos> This is neither the time nor the place, Mr. Spencer.<eos> Okay. How about here and...now?<eos> Dr. Diamond, this guy says he needs to ask you a few questions.
There was a lady came to see him at the club.<eos> It could get out.<eos> Miss Love?<eos> Oh, Harry.<eos> Can I give you a bit of advice?
In another life, you would have made a formidable explorer yourself.<eos> In another life, i'd be chess champion of Great Britain.<eos> Who knows - perhaps i still might.<eos> Mr Crabb, how can i help you?<eos> How can i help YOU, Miss Ravillious?
James, she's a housewife.<eos> Here's $500,000. (Sets bills down)<eos> It's all I have.<eos> You've already taken my husband from me, so please, Mr. schiller, take it and leave us alone.<eos> May I ask you a question?
That's my life.<eos> Oh, exactly.<eos> Your children give you the motivation.<eos> Your husband's business gives you the resources.<eos> Your Petrov d.N.A. Gives you the instincts.
I won't tell a lie, sir. Work's been...<eos> It's been very hard to get any work these past months.<eos> And without a reference, you see...<eos> I got you into this mess.<eos> The least I can do is give you a chance now.
12 hours, dealing with gangsters, crackheads, rapists, all so that people like yourself can sleep better at night.<eos> Now, just because we're peace officers, it doesn't mean we are not entitled to a break, or in this case, enjoying a cold treat on a very hot day just like everyone else.<eos> I pay your salary.<eos> You know what, ma'am? Yes, you do.<eos> Which means that you have actually paid for this.
His name is Ernest Maurice Hamed.<eos> We found a shell from the gun that he used in his car.<eos> This house used to be so noisy.<eos> It was full of their voices.<eos> Miss Jones, I have to tell you something before you hear it on the streets.
First I thought she had run off, but I soon found out my son had stashed her in a love nest.<eos> Unacceptable.<eos> I can understand.<eos> Your son makes a big mess. You want to hire a big man to come in and clean it up.<eos> Finds her, finishes her off, and gives you a nice necklace as a souvenir.
I just want to meet a friend for lunch.<eos> I don't think that's a good idea.<eos> Well, regardless, I'm going.<eos> You can't keep me trapped here.<eos> I'll have to insist we accompany you.
I didn't mean to be rude to you.<eos> I just thought... between you and I, we could do better.<eos> I see.<eos> I understand what you mean.<eos> Next time, I will let you choose the poses you want.
Sure.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Good evening, gentlemen.<eos> Sorry to be in a robe. You caught me getting ready for bed.<eos> Yeah, we need to ask you some questions.
That sounds like a reason for blackmail and murder to me.<eos> There was a witness at the break-in last night.<eos> It all happened so fast.<eos> I heard the crash and I thought my cat gotten onto the China cabinet again.<eos> We know that you've already spoken with the police, but if there's anything more you could tell us about the intruder...
You're doing really, really well.<eos> That's it, that's it, that's it, that's it.<eos> And there we are!<eos> Tiny, and completely perfect.<eos> Congratulations, Mrs Carter, you have a little girl.
Why haven't the council rehoused you?<eos> They say there's ten of us, and we have to have four bedrooms or we're legally overcrowded.<eos> And they ain't building four-bedroom flats.<eos> We'll book you into the Maternity Home.<eos> The facilities are excellent, and you'll get a good rest.
The facilities are excellent, and you'll get a good rest.<eos> Can't be easy, with eight children running round.<eos> I don't want any more, Nurse.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> As soon as baby's born, we'll arrange for you to have the proper contraceptive advice.
I played with Kyle at ut.<eos> Manny Monroe.<eos> Manny the man!<eos> Manny the man might be your friend, but I'm not.<eos> Did mr. Parks ever give you any of his funds off the sale Of the stolen copper wire?
Look, if you just sit down, I'll get somebody for you.<eos> Mrs Haines?<eos> DC Sankey.<eos> Where's Mick?<eos> At this stage, we're not able to give you any more details, but it would really help us if you could give us your account of today's football match.
Now, if you want to go look for her, and I assume you do, you have my blessing.<eos> I can't conduct an effective search by myself. - You know that.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> It's my final decision.<eos> Ms. Peralta, when Tom left you in charge,
I'm equal opportunity like that.<eos> If she's so popular, why are all these people here protesting?<eos> I'm very sorry for your loss, Ms. Cuerto.<eos> It's like... part of me is dead.<eos> I do have to ask you some questions.
Yes. Likes biology.<eos> [ laughs ] never would have guessed that.<eos> And to think we almost lost him.<eos> Well, it all worked out.<eos> Thanks to you and mr.
You answer the door.<eos> Like you've got nothing to hide.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> Yeah, I'm deputy marshal Clayton.<eos> You mind if I ask you a few questions?
Hi, Ildy.<eos> Uh, Vincent forgot to leave me cash this morning.<eos> Normally, he keeps some in this drawer.<eos> He has me hold the petty cash now.<eos> I can get you some.
Shutting myself inside a room and crying myself asleep isn't my style.<eos> Because I really believe he's still alive.<eos> I'll see you at work.<eos> [Nine months later]<eos> What would you like to have?
Didn't have much use for them.<eos> Cole was an exception.<eos> And he deserved better.<eos> A word of advice, for what it's worth.<eos> Set out to correct the world's wrongs and you'll almost certainly wind up adding to them.
Or a dogs' home.<eos> So when did you split it?<eos> Quite recently, actually.<eos> Just a few weeks before he died.<eos> I can get you the paperwork if you like.
It's just a hand.<eos> It could be a million different hands.<eos> Mrs. Bates, we need you to come with us down to the station.<eos> Why?<eos> Sheriff Romero would like to ask you a few questions.
White Cadillac with a black top.<eos> Where you headed, ma'am?<eos> Sheriff, uh, Buffalo, actually, for the surgery.<eos> What's going on?<eos> We need to ask you a few more questions.
Agent Byrne, I was just coming to congratulate you. I couldn't have done it without you.<eos> Your case files have been my bedtime reading for the last two months.<eos> Hope they helped you fall asleep.<eos> Just the opposite, actually.<eos> Can I buy you a drink?
Hanley Folsom only promotes women whose attention to home and family isn't in question.<eos> Except for one thing. Mr. Folsom didn't know.<eos> So you say.<eos> He didn't know because I didn't tell anybody, because it's my business.<eos> Still, he found out, and that's why you were promoted.
It's called a Turnbull Direction.<eos> In your professional opinion, is it important for the judge to warn the jury of the need for caution before convicting anyone in any case that relies so heavily on eyewitness identification?<eos> Should the judge, in that situation, ask the jury to closely examine every circumstance in which the identification was made?<eos> Yes.<eos> Would... I can list them for you if you like.
Yes, sir.<eos> Mr and Mrs Stewart?<eos> Miss Stewart. I'm glad to see you're feeling better.<eos> I'm DI Burns and this is WPC Dawson.<eos> We'd like to ask you a few questions, if we may?
And?<eos> And I've got a lot of oilmen friends that'd be willing to bankroll your campaign if I asked.<eos> Throw the deal to the oil side of Ewing Energies and make a lot of new friends that can help you be all that you can be.<eos> I am almost convinced.<eos> Is there anything I could do to help you get all the way there?
No.<eos> Can your mind be blown on your own time?<eos> Right now I have to talk with my supervisor.<eos> Um, well, you own the hospital now.<eos> So doesn't that make you the supervisor?
This must be a world record, then.<eos> I have money, lots of it, earned by honest endeavor.<eos> Surely not earned by you.<eos> As if it matters.<eos> I can pay you... for any... information.
I don't want him running off.<eos> You believe this sack of shite?<eos> Maguire was one of us.<eos> So was Phinbar Byrnes.<eos> I felt it necessary to thank you in person.
Thank you, so much, Ms. Munn, for coming in on such short notice.<eos> Oh, no problem, but I'm-I'm not sure how I can help.<eos> I just type.<eos> I don't actually catch the bad guys.<eos> Actually, uh, we want to help you.
Okay, I love you.<eos> Bye.<eos> - Scarlett O'Connor?<eos> - Yes, ma'am.<eos> Guy in the audience asked me to give this to you.
This is a crime scene.<eos> We need a hospital.<eos> The bridge is closed.<eos> Wait...<eos> I... I can pay you to let us cross.
Nothing but heroin.<eos> This is great!<eos> I mean, you know, from a story standpoint.<eos> So, what's next?<eos> Mrs. Vega, sorry it took so long to get your vehicle back to you.
Now this here is a stunning sort of navigational device.<eos> I just thought you might want to comment on how he endangered the lives of those young students.<eos> But it would be wrong and unethical for me to prejudge the investigation.<eos> - This is a bell. - (BELL DINGS)<eos> Can we get some shots ofjust you and Janet walking in the hallway?
What, you think?<eos> I'm just saying the way you handled that gunshot and the baby, you kept your cool.<eos> I keep my cool.<eos> I do.<eos> Dr. Roman. You have a patient.
But, Lockhart runs a pretty tight ship, So don't say anything Unless you're asked a direct question, okay?<eos> ...Both sides are in agreement as to distribution of property. Support is moot<eos> Since there are no children--<eos> Did you have something to say, Mrs. Rendall?<eos> Mm-mm. Did your attorney Advise you not to speak in my courtroom?
Then what?<eos> He told me he wouldn't blame me if I did kill him.<eos> I wouldn't blame you.<eos> I really wouldn't.<eos> But then, I wouldn't be able to get you any money.
The Agency had to call in a lot of favors to close that investigation. Your going over there jeopardized all that.<eos> I wanted to see where it happened.<eos> Why?<eos> It upset me. I was upset by it.<eos> Director Berenson has shown... an unusual degree of confidence in you, Miss Sherazi... entrusted you with matters of national importance.
What she means is that Gina's safer here with us.<eos> You're supposed to take care of your daughter. Sonya...<eos> Oxycontin?<eos> Are you using, ma'am?<eos> Your husband couldn't get you help?
I'm a defense attorney.<eos> I don't care why Mona's confessed.<eos> Whether she did it or not, she's helped my case by giving me an alternate explanation for the crime.<eos> - So... - and she may have done.<eos> But she's going to turn the tables on you.
I can't wait any longer.<eos> Here they come.<eos> Mrs. Marin, I'm Sidney Barnes, the district attorney.<eos> I just wanted to tell you this myself.<eos> We're dropping the charges against you.
You're very pretty to be a nurse.<eos> She's a doctor, Mrs Black.<eos> You'd make a handsome couple.<eos> Do you think?<eos> If you ladies have finished gossiping, I'll just give you these antibiotics and we can let you rest.
Please inform my wife that the dog is my property, and she'll have to turn it over to me... now.<eos> Please, Charles.<eos> I'm afraid he's correct.<eos> Your Honor, if I may?<eos> Mrs. Van Horn, have you ever bought Stella anything using money from a personal account?
How are you feeling? Oh, I've been beat up worse by Congress a few times.<eos> I'll live.<eos> I just need to change your I.V., if now's a good time.<eos> You're here.<eos> So, how long have you been a doctor?
You work as an escort for the... Private Companion Agency, is that right? (Clicks pen)<eos> Strictly speaking, I'm a... independent contractor.<eos> That means the company offers the service, but the terms are negotiated between the client and me.<eos> Also, they don't pay withholding or F.I.C.A. taxes.<eos> And Stone was paying for you to sleep with him?
But not in those exact words.<eos> Look, I regret a lot of things, but it was true.<eos> Nicole was... you know, she was upset.<eos> She was looking for attention.<eos> Or maybe she was trying to tell you something.
Were you aware that the Garrison has a reputation as a hot spot for prostitution?<eos> I had no idea.<eos> And it is not as if the guys walk around with name tags that say "hello.<eos> I'm a gigolo."<eos> Are you familiar with this issue of "L.A. Weekly"?
I'm so very sorry, uh, Miss...<eos> Wells.<eos> Miss Wells.<eos> Look, I don't usually do this, but why don't you come inside?<eos> I can't in good conscience allow you to drive back to Los Angeles in this state. Thank you.
You're here to make your argument.<eos> I can name at least three felonies you're committing.<eos> Kidnapping, unlawful imprisonment, coercion!<eos> Why should I make my argument to you?<eos> Because if we decide that you're innocent of your husband's murder, we can provide you with an alternate identity and a fresh start in a new city.
Uh, Mr. French.<eos> If you don't mind, I'd like a word with you and Ms. Kaswell.<eos> Uh, of course.<eos> Thank you, Mr. Tuttle, but why are you here?<eos> Well, I hadn't planned to tell you this in the hospital, but it can't wait.
- The best.<eos> Ingrid Beauchamp.<eos> Mrs. Gardiner!<eos> - Just the woman I wanted to see.<eos> - Can I help you with a book?
- No, he didn't.<eos> - And did you try to force it on him because you'd lost to him numerous times and you wanted to get him back?<eos> You're the only one who's trying to get Harvey back for losing, Tanner.<eos> And I'm about to be successful.<eos> Isn't it true that while you were engaged, you came to New York and slept with Harvey Specter in an attempt to get him to tell you he loved you and he said no?
I think we've heard enough.<eos> - Stacy, let's g...<eos> - Hold on. Don't listen to him.<eos> He's just the sperm donor.<eos> I am a single mother, and I will not allow you to reject my child.
I was wrong.<eos> The interv...<eos> Ms. Lockhart?<eos> Ms. Lockhart, Lisa asked me to give you a message.<eos> Eli Gold called and wanted you to know... Don't worry about giving the interview. He found another way.
Doctor, when will she regain her memory?<eos> Some patients take weeks<eos> Others never regain their memories<eos> I suggest that you... spend more time with family and friends<eos> They may be able to help you regain... the 5 years of memory since 2007
With the occasional bonus for good performance.<eos> That's $572 annually with a prospective yearly rental of over half that.<eos> I imagine you're frugal, but subtracting for the grocer, transportation, clothing, sundries and what have you, it seems these particular quarters are above your means.<eos> I fail to see what business this is of yours.<eos> May I offer you some free advice?
Curious.<eos> We know your partner was a man, and that he'd managed to get in and out of your home without upsetting her.<eos> So was it someone that she had grown used to over time, Or was it someone that she'd simply never forgotten?<eos> Beth Roney, you have the right to remain silent.<eos> Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
Julia's got some time off from work.<eos> Maybe you could.<eos> That would be wonderful.<eos> I mean, I was gonna suggest a tutor, but that's even better.<eos> I can give you some extra reading assignments and exercises.
- to come with us.<eos> - Are we going to the hospital?<eos> - Yeah, all in good time.<eos> - No, I need to be with Courtney.<eos> We just need to ask you a few questions first.
Where's the menu?<eos> Is that so?<eos> Over there.<eos> Thank you for giving us such a wonderful party.<eos> We're very honored to be able to bring you such enjoyable moment.
(cackles) (explosion)<eos> ♪<eos> What exactly are you here for?<eos> MAC: We need $40 million.<eos> So we've shot a great deal of the movie, and we're gonna show it to you.
I tried to warn you.<eos> I tried to ignore you.<eos> I am sorry, Oliver.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oliver threw you a lovely party.
- I did it. - Did what?<eos> I spoke to the F.D.A., filled out the release, I just need you to sign it...<eos> Ross. Before they can start reviewing it.<eos> We're not gonna do it.<eos> Call them back. You said you'd consider it if I covered the obstacles.
I can't believe Leo was a killer.<eos> Were you aware of his real name? Vitaly.<eos> His name, to me, was Leo.<eos> That was his real name.<eos> Can you think of anyone that your husband may have wanted to harm?
Mrs. Tolbert, we're very sorry to intrude.<eos> You have some nerve.<eos> I know who you are, what you're trying to do.<eos> Look, whatever you may have heard about us, we are not here to tell you that Frank Henson is innocent.<eos> We'd just like to ask you some questions.
Mr. Castle.<eos> Uh, please come in. Have a seat.<eos> As a tireless self-promoter, let me offer you one of my pens.<eos> No, thank you.<eos> We're just here to ask you a few questions.
It's been a while since we've seen each other.<eos> I met Rachel while I was in the U.S.<eos> I heard.<eos> Your family's doing well, right?<eos> Thanks to you.
Do you work as a notary, Miss Gidfar?<eos> Do I?<eos> No.<eos> - Are you in the legal profession?<eos> - Uh-uh. The reason I ask is, Mr. Ashbaugh seemed to trust you with the witnessing of such an important document.
Do you have a connection to Joanne Keeghan?<eos> US attorney down town.<eos> Mr. Matthews, you've got a lot of friends in this city.<eos> I recieved 4 phone calls in matters of an hour.<eos> I'm sure you'd do the same for your kids.
I found her. She was in the chem labs, looking for the bathroom.<eos> Well, perfect, then, uh, why don't you take over from here, Sachs, you know, introduce our little tribe, and uh... and guide Ms. Rey through the... through the tower.<eos> The funny thing is, I'm not even supposed to be here.<eos> I was meant to be in Seoul, but the air traffic controller strike screwed everything up, so now I'm on the... pond jumper tonight.<eos> Do you ever think that the universe is against you?
Oh, there we go.<eos> All right, Miss Clayton.<eos> Everything appears to be in order here.<eos> Wonderful.<eos> Now, before we finish, I'm required to ask you a few questions.
THAT WAS MY SISTER. Oh.<eos> What happened?<eos> SHE DIED.<eos> Can you pay cash?<eos> CAN I CALL YOU BACK?
Chief, looks like you have two aggressor vehicles approaching from the north, about one mike out.<eos> You can take the truck outside the west door.<eos> Meet us at extract.<eos> Miss Morales, I'm bringing you home.<eos> I just need to ask you a few questions.
Not ever.<eos> I understand that, Mrs. Morelli but Joe missed his court appearance...<eos> You understand nothing.<eos> Wait till you have a child and some stone heart comes along in a car and break his legs that God gave him. Then maybe, you can stand on my step and tell me you understand.<eos> Okay, but maybe... maybe I could just give you my number, you know when...
My son hates me, because I took his power away. They would have killed him, too.<eos> And my daughter, she's ashamed of me. And I am proud of her for it.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Why?<eos> I don't know. I guess I feel bad for you.
I hope you're still teaching next term.<eos> You will hear all about that when the tribe comes over.<eos> You know,<eos> I almost dread this trip.<eos> I wish I could accompany you.
I have to take that seriously.<eos> We've been here 20 years and I'm not packing my bags ever again.<eos> They won't kick you out because of a few articles!<eos> Are you so sure about that?<eos> The nice, old man on the 10th floor said to give you this right away.
Yes, she did, that's exactly what we are to you. We were animals.<eos> What I'm saying is give me proof that a photon of light can pass through a human body and I will start to believe in invisibility.<eos> Until that happens, all we're talking about here is simple subjective beliefs.<eos> What do you believe in, Dr. Matheson?<eos> Do you have a transcendent view of life?
Go on, play.<eos> Play.<eos> - Are you sullen and obstinate?<eos> - No, ma'am!<eos> I am very sorry for you and sorry that I can't play.
- I think it's being done as we speak.<eos> - Bet he didn't even do it.<eos> Can we try and get through just a few questions?<eos> I know you're upset, Governor.<eos> So why don't you get a good night's sleep, and I will come back first thing in the morning to prep you when you're feeling better?
- Bet he didn't even do it.<eos> Can we try and get through just a few questions?<eos> I know you're upset, Governor.<eos> So why don't you get a good night's sleep, and I will come back first thing in the morning to prep you when you're feeling better?<eos> I'm gonna leave this for you to... look over.
I think we need to get rid of these note cards.<eos> - They're not helping.<eos> - Okay. I hate those flippin' cards anyway.<eos> Now, what we need you to do is to memorize 25 answers and four attack lines.<eos> Do you think you can do that?
Daniel, what is going on?<eos> There's another victim.<eos> Ms. Nelson? I'm Agent Moretti, FBI.<eos> This is Dr. Pierce.<eos> Would you mind if I asked you a couple questions for our case against Dr. Bryant?
When I kissed him, I could taste the salt on his neck.<eos> What did he do with his clothes from that night?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Took them to the dry cleaner. I don't know.<eos> Do you have a key to his apartment?
That's a great, I'd say.<eos> Wow.<eos> Gee, you're a legend.<eos> This is an honor.<eos> Thank you for my job.
- Hurry up.<eos> He's trying to get out.<eos> - Come on, Clair.<eos> Come on, pick up, pick up. Come on, Clair. Pick up, pick up.<eos> - You say he threatened you?
This is what they call a "watershed" for you.<eos> It's a crossroads.<eos> This is when you choose the life that you are going to lead.<eos> My advice to you is that you stand up for yourself and separate yourself from this damn criminal family.<eos> Mrs. Farrel, I stole this from you...
I have been going out of my mind after what you said.<eos> Well, think no more of it.<eos> Any man with such a wife as you would have to be mad to seek happiness elsewhere.<eos> I don't think Dr Stromming's mad.<eos> Look, can I get you a drink?
- I don't know him.<eos> - Are you sure?<eos> Look again, properly. It's important.<eos> If I don't know him, I don't know him.<eos> The man in the CCTV may have murdered everyone you worked with.
What?<eos> Oh, relax.<eos> I'm okay with early birds.<eos> Connie Thomas, Thomas realty.<eos> Officially, the open house doesn't start for an hour, but if you help me lay out the finger sandwiches, I'll let you sneak the first peek.
There's another reason.<eos> I was the one who destroyed the memo and all the carbon copies.<eos> I shredded them.<eos> But I'm not going to jail for it.<eos> But if George Algers told you to destroy the memo...
Well, then change it.<eos> The only person I've ever seen go head-to-head with Regina and win is you.<eos> That's because I know how to pick my battles.<eos> Then pick this one.<eos> I'm afraid I'm just simply not the man to help you beat mayor Mills.
- Counsel...<eos> - Annie!<eos> - I'm talking!<eos> Ms. Bilson, I'm going to ask you, please, to contain yourself.<eos> Can you do that?
If you don't stop hiding behind all those words very soon, you'd better start thinking about living for the next ten years where none of those count for a bloody thing!<eos> Did courageous restraint frustrate you?<eos> It frustrated all of us.<eos> An aggressive-minded officer doesn't like being on the back foot.<eos> Whose side are you on?
When did you come back from your wander?<eos> My wander?<eos> Your word.<eos> My brother's blood in our kitchen and my sister drunk.<eos> Have you any idea what that felt like?
And not one of them came home.<eos> Mrs Thackeray...<eos> I shall be inviting a friend to tea on Sunday.<eos> Oh, yes?<eos> I wondered if I might prevail on you to make your famous ladyfingers.
I want to stay with him, but if I cannot, please send me away and let him be free.<eos> I love him.<eos> I didn't buy a word you said.<eos> But a judge might.<eos> I'm gonna let you stay.
Quite true.<eos> Niall was saving up for a deposit.<eos> Money seemed to pour out of him.<eos> Forgive me, Mrs. Culham, but you... you have savings of your own?<eos> Your husband's death left you comfortably off?
I didn't think you had a big list, to be honest.<eos> One head?<eos> I don't know. I guess I thought you'd give a damn.<eos> I guess I thought that because he served his country and it left him a wreck that you would want to do something.<eos> I guess I thought that because he's a human being living on the street like an animal that you would want to help, but I see now that -- that you have no interest!
It's a perfect match.<eos> Tell me what happened.<eos> It was supposed to be me.<eos> I was supposed to be the face of Wyck's return.<eos> Because you had been his inspiration before.
He have any idea where Lilly may have gone?<eos> Charles and Lilly don't get along.<eos> That wouldn't happen to be Charles Burnett, would it?<eos> Yes.<eos> Ms. Stillwater, we'll do all we can to find your girl. Thank you.
We are so sorry for your loss, Mrs. Stone.<eos> May I see her?<eos> No.<eos> I'm afraid that's not possible while the case is ongoing, but soon.<eos> Do you have any idea where your daughter may have gone after her release yesterday morning?
I... I thought someone had been following me.<eos> Did you tell the police that?<eos> No.<eos> But I told Brent and some of my co-workers.<eos> Did they believe you?
Counsel, we don't punish people for singing to their kids.<eos> Your Honor, look at his face.<eos> Can you deny it's a little frightening?<eos> Turn it off, please.<eos> Ms. Higgins, has your ex-husband directly threatened you or hit you?
Thank you.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> Beautiful...and quick.<eos> Oh, sorry.<eos> Did anybody ever tell you that you have an amazing smile?
- No, you're a normal lady<eos> You're dull!<eos> Hello, ma'am.<eos> I'm Eduard.<eos> I called you before to thank you for the letter.
Uh, his chest hit the wheel when he crashed.<eos> Well, I'm gonna have to reduce the hernia.<eos> Book an O.R.<eos> Bump any nonemergent patients, and find someone to scrub in with me.<eos> Dr. Hunt has agreed to let me back on your service, so I can scrub in with you.
Ball.<eos> You're a funny lady.<eos> Well, that's how I make my living.<eos> All right, Ms. Ball.<eos> We are gonna get you worked up and send you on your way.
Well, we're going to have to take it with us.<eos> It's evidence.<eos> I spoke to them yesterday.<eos> They said they were going to come and collect me later today.<eos> - Did they give you an address?
I'd like to know if he found that bleach here or he brought it with him.<eos> What the hell difference does that make?<eos> Well, if he brought it with him, he is a pro, not some tweaker pulling a crime of opportunity.<eos> Ma'am, I am so sorry.<eos> I was hoping to spare you this sight.
So I started looking into open cases.<eos> I figure a lot of homicide suspects vanish into thin air.<eos> What if the Butcher took some of them out?<eos> That's good thinking.<eos> Did you find anything?
But I will be calling on you very shortly.<eos> Right here's fine.<eos> I'm going to Liberty Heights.<eos> What's that?<eos> Did you find everything you were looking for?
I don't know if I should tell her to come up or give her water or something like that.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hi. Brought you something.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I just wanted to thank you in person.
He testified in great detail on all the... on all the nights you claim he was having sex with you that he was somewhere else.<eos> How is this not a classic he-said/she-said?<eos> Because it's not.<eos> Because... I'm telling the truth. And that's all you have to say?<eos> That is why we should believe you?
- Agent Delaney. It was definitely the right thing to do.<eos> In fact, I want you to know we have a bigger offer-- someone who offered our asking price-- but I'd rather you have the house.<eos> Oh, I... well, I'm so thrilled to hear that.<eos> Mrs. Florrick. I checked the drop gun. I checked what you mentioned.<eos> So we're giving you a chance to top their offer.
No, it's not.<eos> Not by a long shot.<eos> When can you spare me an hour, Detective?<eos> I've got something to show you.<eos> Can I give you a hand with that?
I want to know everything that you know about the operation that killed Nate.<eos> Mrs. Westen, that's what we call classified information.<eos> It's an operation that one of my boys died in and the other one ran.<eos> I realize that.<eos> And I wish I could help you, but I can't.
World War ll specialist.<eos> I wanted to ask you about the setting up of BSC... British Security Coordination... in New York and what they were doing in America in 1941.<eos> Why on earth would you want to know that?<eos> I thought I was asking the questions.<eos> May I offer you a cup of tea'?
Can I help you?<eos> Police. Open the door, please.<eos> Where's Nathan, where's your boss?<eos> Oh, he's upstairs.<eos> Has he given you anything to eat?
Regardless, it is your right to decide if or when you want the tumor removed.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Ms. Keck, you pled guilty to the attempted murder of Chase Black?<eos> Got 15 years.<eos> Are you receiving any special treatment from my office in exchange for your testimony?
Please walk us through the time line of the night you sabotaged Mr. Black's car.<eos> Got done with work around 8:00 in Hollywood.<eos> Got to Chase's around 8:30.<eos> Cut the brakes and took off.<eos> Why would you attempt to kill a man you've never met?
You okay?<eos> I think so.<eos> Just, uh, waiting for Bob.<eos> They found some other evidence, and I'm just not sure what to make of it all.<eos> Look, uh, I'm trying to help you out here.
Are you taking water with it?<eos> Yes.<eos> And food?<eos> Yes, I've been taking it with my meals.<eos> And have you been urinating regularly? Well yes, I have.
Back there, when you were talking to your fiance, we heard every word.<eos> You can't do that.<eos> There's no expectation of privacy in jail.<eos> So let's talk.<eos> I'm not gonna help you try to convict my friend.
Back there, when you were talking to your fiancé, - ...we heard every word.<eos> - You can't do that.<eos> There's no expectation of privacy in jail.<eos> So... let's talk.<eos> I'm not gonna help you try to convict my friend.
Gotcha.<eos> Okay, I'll take it from here.<eos> CSI Delko, correct?<eos> Yes, that's correct.<eos> I want to thank you for bringing your grandson in.
Spare me the bullshit.<eos> We're off the record.<eos> My office informed me that we were given a choice, either I let you cover me the week of Douglas's engagement, or you were gonna run a piece about my other son Thomas's difficulties with sobriety.<eos> An empty threat.<eos> Except that you managed to obtain a sealed document regarding one night last December.
Still the same breakfast-- steel-cut oats and blueberries.<eos> You wouldn't remember, but I was in your pool for two years during your ex-husband's first run for the presidency.<eos> Before they put me on the DC desk.<eos> I remember.<eos> You were just out of school, you had a sister at Amherst, and your mother was a former physician.
How?<eos> She had this on her when I attacked her.<eos> She had the blood on it tested.<eos> Led her straight to me.<eos> Parsons got the D .A.'s office to grant me immunity if I testify against you.
Try and get inside his head.<eos> They go with him because he has something they want.<eos> What if we give him what he's looking for?<eos> We made an arrest this afternoon. - What?<eos> - I must say, it's thanks to you.
It's just that you just touched the chart, which actually negates the effects of the sanitizer.<eos> Would you mind doing it again?<eos> I'm...<eos> I'm sorry. It's just that I have OCD.<eos> Which is in my chart, which I... I realize I'm not letting you read.
in Employment Act which has been interpreted to cover many different policy positions.<eos> I'm a lawyer.<eos> Well, I was, you know, until my OCD got out of control, okay?<eos> Um, do you have a pen?<eos> I'll just write it down for you.
That's probably why he was the first to get sick.<eos> Wait... Madigan's still using the chemical?<eos> What about the other workers?<eos> Well, I got my people on it, but I have to ask you a question.<eos> Did anybody else from the winery pay you a visit?
It was a man.<eos> Blocked number.<eos> 11:41. That's it.<eos> But if he wasn't the boss, then why were you even...<eos> Do you have any idea how... colossally you just screwed up?
There's gonna be cops all over this place.<eos> - Ed. Where the fuck is Ed? - Ed's keeping a low profile.<eos> There's way too much heat on him to risk being seen.<eos> All right, where's my tape?<eos> We'll give it to you when we come pick up the bag. No!
I mean, a month.<eos> A month?<eos> That's a long time.<eos> I thought I just saw him the other day.<eos> No, I told you.
I saw Andy.<eos> He did mention that... that he, uh... he and Mark were consulting with a lawyer.<eos> Well, as it turned out, he went to see Martin London... much honored lawyer, retired.<eos> He's Mark's father-in-law.<eos> - Yes. Diana: He'd invested a substantial amount of money with you, right?
I said move away from the computer!<eos> The advisory was a completely separate business, a completely separate entity.<eos> And I made it that way on purpose, obviously.<eos> What about your brother? Peter's in trouble.<eos> - Bernie: Yes. - Because he trusted you.
Sometimes I'd whistle down at her and she'd look up and call me a dog.<eos> But I liked having her there.<eos> I mean, we've basically been together every day since the night we met.<eos> It's our 51st anniversary coming up.<eos> Mm. How do you think you were able to keep it all separate?
Diana: Well, it was a $65 billion Ponzi scheme.<eos> People lost their life savings, they lost their homes.<eos> Their lives were destroyed.<eos> You didn't think of that as stealing?<eos> People felt safe with you.
Well, but these people, you know, they had a little greed in them, too.<eos> There was a little bit of, you know... look, you know, and they didn't wanna look too hard.<eos> They looked just far enough.<eos> - So they're accomplices in some way, too.<eos> - Bernie. Accomplices because they trusted you?
- Eleanor: Hello, Madoff.<eos> - Man: I'm in the fucking lobby. I wanna come up.<eos> Sir, I am not able to give you permission to come up here right now.<eos> Where is my fucking money? !<eos> You have to call the advisory arm. - I can give you their number.
That's, uh, not gonna do it.<eos> So what's it gonna take?<eos> I have to do what's ethical. - I can't let you jump the line.<eos> - I'll go 150 if you let me.<eos> - Love to help you, but I can't.
good morning sir, Welcome to Williamsburg Savings Bank.<eos> Let me give you a call, We will arrange an interview for you With a bank employee. Once someone is available.
Do not leave my family on that island!<eos> Hey, grab the lifesaver, grab it!<eos> Mr. Riley. Detective Constable Haagen.<eos> We spoke on the phone.<eos> The US Embassy has been notified, and the US Coast Guard Captain will guide you through the rescue plan.
- The fisherman called Jorge on his phone when we left the bank.<eos> Being on the run, you are making your case infinitely harder.<eos> Jorge definitely has a cell phone, so the only way I'm gonna give myself up is if you... you trace his calls you get him, you bring him to Main Square at noon and you have yourself, the police, and a translator.<eos> That's the only way I'm gonna give myself up, do you hear me?<eos> Mr. Riley, I promise you, I am gonna do everything in my power to help you out but I want you to do me one favor.
My goodness.<eos> Your lip...<eos> looks like fresh blood.<eos> Yeah. Tastes like it, too.<eos> I hope you don't mind watching me eat.
Among many others.<eos> But this girlfriend of yours, congratulations.<eos> That's good, that's very good.<eos> I mean, after all, you need to feel the feelings before you can write about them.<eos> So I write the card for her and I give it to you.
We'll do a drug deal.<eos> iPhone.<eos> I'm sorry, what?<eos> Look, maybe I deal, maybe I don't.<eos> I'll tell you for a new iPhone.
- Enough of that shit.<eos> - I'll fight you again.<eos> I've been waiting to fuck you up for a long time.<eos> Why?<eos> But I'll tell you for an iPhone.
We don't have a day.<eos> Hello, there.<eos> Bill Randa here to see senator Willis.<eos> Of course, Mr. Randa.<eos> I left you a message this morning about rescheduling today's appointment.
Are we going to walk all night? Possibly.<eos> It's a long word.<eos> What is?<eos> "Bollocks".<eos> Culverton Smith, all this charity work, what's in it for you?
I've sent a car, should be outside.<eos> Mr Holmes gave me an address.<eos> Well, he couldn't have given you this one...<eos> When you're ready.<eos> When did Sherlock give you this address?
Five minutes?<eos> Come back in ten.<eos> Saheed... this time, knock.<eos> How can you do that?<eos> I mean, how are you even allowed in here?
How can you do that?<eos> I mean, how are you even allowed in here?<eos> Oh, I can go anywhere I like.<eos> Anywhere at all.<eos> They gave you keys?
Mr. Todd?<eos> Yes, Roger?<eos> Can I ask you a question?<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Why do you let him make you... do these things?
Mr. Jackpots! Mr. Jackpots! Tell me which one.<eos> Thank you!<eos> Now 30.<eos> Thank you, Mr. Jackpots! Thank you! Thank you, Mr. Jackpots.<eos> Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you.
Is there anything we can do to help?<eos> Call for help.<eos> Call who?<eos> Who?<eos> Well, we'd certainly like to help you.
Dougie.<eos> A few days ago.<eos> Few... days ago.<eos> Is there a reason why you didn't report your car missing? Reason?<eos> Yeah, I'll tell you a reason.
Later...<eos> In his next lecture, Professor will explain how Wang Xuance single-handily overturned a country.<eos> Roll-call will be taken.<eos> Please don't be tardy.<eos> TA, let me help you.
This is Dr. Ashmita from the Palace Museum Research Institute of Rajasthan, India.<eos> Nice to meet you, Professor Chen.<eos> Your reputation precedes you.<eos> Your continuing research about the Kingdom of Magadha has filled a gap between China and India.<eos> Thank you so much.
As long as it worked.<eos> - I appreciate it.<eos> - Appreciate your friend Bobby Fish.<eos> We all did some impressive book-cracking.<eos> Plus, you made it through a prison stint without throwing a single punch.
Okay, with any luck, you're gonna tell her that yourself.<eos> Now your family is worried.<eos> They just wanted to know what happened.<eos> And the cops...<eos> They just wanna know why you started stockpiling explosives.
To be honest, if you hurt my friend, I'm gonna hurt you worse.<eos> I was just trying to stop them.<eos> - They're gonna take down the city.<eos> - Who?<eos> I can't help you if you won't tell me who.
- Let me guess, Jeri Hogarth.<eos> - Right.<eos> I didn't know she did diversity hires.<eos> Uh, I'm independent. I don't work for her firm.<eos> - Well, I'm not paying you.
So, do me a favor, Frank.<eos> Just meet the family. See how it feels.<eos> It's all I ask.<eos> d Fly away litlle prety bird d d Fly.<eos> So, while I'm trying to sell you on the house... and us... I just don't want you to think that we're completely insesitive... to what the feeling.
I'm sure there wasn't.<eos> Around here.<eos> Could you just have a seat in here, please?<eos> Okay, thanks.<eos> Can I get you any water, anything to drink? No, no, thank you.
Mr. melnyk?<eos> Mr. melnyk?<eos> My name is Tessa corbett, I'm a journalist.<eos> I know you're in there.<eos> I don't want to bother you, I just came 'cause I wanted to share some of my articles with you.
Mr. melnyk?<eos> My name is Tessa corbett, I'm a journalist.<eos> I know you're in there.<eos> I don't want to bother you, I just came 'cause I wanted to share some of my articles with you.<eos> I'm writing a book about the accident and I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Yes. Please take a moment to consider the consequences of your refusal...<eos> What consequences?<eos> What consequences? Perhaps we should adjourn.<eos> Mr Delaney...<eos> I'll give you one last chance to behave like a loyal subject of His Majesty and the lawful crown of England. Like a loyal subject of His Majesty and the lawful crown of England.
You witnessed the division of the gunpowder and you heard its destination?<eos> On direct instruction of James Delaney himself, sir.<eos> We have Delaney, we have Nootka, we have the China trade.<eos> They will walk you along a tightrope. A line between life and death.<eos> I will give you all the information that you request. In return, I will need a single meeting with Sir Stuart Strange.
I did my research on you. Genevieve Decoux.<eos> From New Orleans.<eos> Please, Mr. Delaney, we do not have much time.<eos> You sent the giant to kill me?<eos> The outcome persuaded us you should be courted instead.
The places you met. Code names, signals.<eos> The location of the powder you gave them.<eos> Now, if you can give me all that and what you tell us is corroborated, then... then these people won't be needed and you will await trial in the same cell that Thomas Moore occupied, with not an unpleasant view of the River Thames.<eos> So...?<eos> I will give you all the information that you request... but in return, I will need a single meeting with
Dougie Jones.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Hon, you want some cherry pie?<eos> Cherry pie.<eos> Go sit down. I'll bring you a slice.
I'm pretty sure the Afghan ambassador here is from Afghanistan.<eos> General.<eos> Sir.<eos> Swell.<eos> I don't want for this dinner to be awkward for you, General, so I will tell you now that we intend to give you our portion of the troops that you request.
I've been trying to contact you.<eos> Oh, yes, I'm sorry.<eos> I'm not feeling well.<eos> I understand, sir.<eos> But did they not tell you this is urgent?
Benjamin Jones, I'd like you to meet my supervisor, Agent Justine Diaz.<eos> Agent Dao speaks very highly of you, Agent Diaz.<eos> You mean Special Agent Dao, now of the FBI's Intelligence Division.<eos> I got promoted thanks to you.<eos> Thanks to you, Mr. Jones, we were able to put Sybil Griffiths behind bars.
Agent Dao speaks very highly of you, Agent Diaz.<eos> You mean Special Agent Dao, now of the FBI's Intelligence Division.<eos> I got promoted thanks to you.<eos> Thanks to you, Mr. Jones, we were able to put Sybil Griffiths behind bars.<eos> And ever since, Dao has been after me to sign off on a deal that'll get you out in three to five years.
And ever since, Dao has been after me to sign off on a deal that'll get you out in three to five years.<eos> I would be very grateful.<eos> Here's the thing, though.<eos> I have a problem with you being out on the street in three to five years.<eos> What would you say if I told you I could get you out of here tomorrow?
I'd say... what's the catch?<eos> - The answer is no.<eos> - We're giving you your freedom.<eos> You're giving me a death sentence.<eos> We're giving you the opportunity to live exactly as you did before.
We don't need Nick.<eos> I'll find Tommy.<eos> Guys?<eos> We have a walk-in.<eos> So, how can we help you, Mr...?
A few miles.<eos> I think I'll meet Glinda at the foot of the Eternal Warrior. Show of strength.<eos> But meeting her halfway... shouldn't you make her come to you?<eos> If I didn't know better, I'd think you were on my side, Isabel.<eos> Glinda may have chosen me, but I serve you.
Now, wait a minute. Bernard...<eos> I need to get to know him better.<eos> This is a massive risk to take.<eos> Well, we... We all of us have to take risks, Douglas.<eos> We've taken one by telling you as much as we have.
Into what?<eos> There's a standing instruction, Superintendent.<eos> All senior police officers provide a contact address, or phone number, day and night.<eos> Yes.<eos> Come on. I'm going to give you a lesson you will never forget.
I prefer honesty to pretence.<eos> That doesn't make me a spy.<eos> No.<eos> That makes you a challenge.<eos> Look, I'm telling you, I don't know anything.
Great.<eos> I slept through first class.<eos> Sorry we had to make an emergency landing.<eos> Can't blame us for the weather.<eos> I can get you on a flight tomorrow that'll get you into Eagle Point by 6.
The rich history you have with other journalists...<eos> I chose you precisely because we don't have a history.<eos> Now, don't fuck it up.<eos> Fifteen seconds.<eos> People trust you...
Hello, how are you!<eos> Hi, Mr. Cantrell.<eos> Hey, Sheri.<eos> Hey, Clay.<eos> Let me help you to your chair.
- I didn't say that. You saw her.<eos> And she told you things were bad.<eos> That she didn't care about anything, that she wanted everything to stop.<eos> When did you talk to her last?<eos> She told you how she got to that point.
And they always will.<eos> And they'll know what they did.<eos> You're the last person to get the tapes.<eos> Hannah didn't leave any instructions on what happens after you... so you get to decide.<eos> And I added tape number 14... which I hope will help you make that decision.
Such is the nature of being anathema to the empire.<eos> And the only way I can protect them is to ensure that once they walk through these gates, their anonymity is protected, too.<eos> Here, they must cease to be to be able to find peace.<eos> I already said I'm not an enemy of his, nor is the man who sent me.<eos> Yes, and I believe you when you say it.
- Fuck you!<eos> We fucked once.<eos> And no one can know about it.<eos> - Hey. - Shit, man.<eos> They didn't let you clean up?
Bigger the bank, the safer the banker.<eos> So, the IRS?<eos> Leave the IRS to me.<eos> Section 41C of the US tax code affords my client the right to licensed representation in the face of any IRS inquiry.<eos> As counsel, I'm filing here with you an official protest to this baseless and cockeyed inquiry, and demand you withdraw immediately and file by mail the statutory-required 30-day notice listing the exact documents you require and personnel you wish to interview.
From Brussels?<eos> They got phones in Belgium, yeah? Email?<eos> Mr. Varga.<eos> You're asking me if there are phones in Belgium?<eos> Let me tell you what's gonna happen next.
Thank you.<eos> Hope you burn, piece of shit.<eos> - Asshole.<eos> - Murderer.<eos> Let me help you with that, Judge.
I had to see you.<eos> Yeah, you want to see me, then make an appointment.<eos> I'm not leaving until you check me out.<eos> You may be the only person that can stop... what's happening with me.<eos> I give my time to you, that means I take it from someone else, and I'm not willing to do that because you bullied your way into my office.
Clear. And sharp.<eos> Nice job.<eos> Nice job.<eos> You have the right to remain silent.<eos> Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
And that he's not the only one.<eos> Is that what this is?<eos> They're afraid I may dig out what's fucked in your department.<eos> But not if I'm in jail.<eos> Well, I can't let you go, Judge.
There's plenty of air in there.<eos> I am gonna close the lid, but you can get out at any time.<eos> If you wanna take your money in the box with you, that's fine.<eos> Some folks worry that we're gonna run off with it while they're inside.<eos> No, I trust you.
Good to see you, Mr. President.<eos> I wish the circumstances were different, but it appears the shit has hit the fan, sir.<eos> Let's get to the situation room.<eos> Mr. President, for reasons I cannot fathom, we remain at DEFCON 3.<eos> This is the case containing the nuclear football, which will give you remote launch capability.
I had concerns when we first arrived in Nassau, and I told her as much... that the instincts that had allowed her to survive for so long there, to thrive there, would eventually return.<eos> And that when they did, it would cause conflict between us.<eos> I don't believe that's what's happened, my Lord.<eos> You don't?<eos> She's done this out of devotion to you.
Woodes Rogers bears debts he cannot hope to repay.<eos> Given the ruin Nassau lies in, those debts could be purchased for a mere fraction of their value, for pennies.<eos> You could own Woodes Rogers and see him imprisoned.<eos> Meanwhile, while Nassau smolders, her real property could be bought for a song.<eos> I bring you the chance, sir, to own the island, shape the regime that runs it, and do it all while seeing justice visited on your granddaughter's murderer.
Their intent is to cause terror and destruction until civilization simply ceases to function.<eos> The threat will not...<eos> The defense of civilization is not your responsibility, sir!<eos> Your duty is to restore stable profits to Nassau.<eos> And the men charged to follow you to that end are already questioning their trust in you.
When my son was disappeared, the police said he was involved with drugs.<eos> I knew they were lying.<eos> When they came here, they were looking for something. They did not find it.<eos> You see?<eos> My son believed his secrets would be safe with you.
Means Kolovi knew about it from the beginning.<eos> These are early experiments of the men who I believe are responsible for your son's disappearance.<eos> That one is Professor Kolovi.<eos> I showed him a picture of my son and he denied ever meeting him.<eos> What did your journalistic intuition tell you about him?
See what he did?<eos> We handle ourselves and Chuck gives someone Head of Crim.<eos> Or we cooperate with Dake and try our luck starting over with Chuck's replacement.<eos> Yeah, we saw what he did.<eos> And so you haven't seen anything that makes you think this office is acting
Yeah, we saw what he did.<eos> And so you haven't seen anything that makes you think this office is acting<eos> - in an out-of-bounds manner?<eos> - Ambiguous.<eos> Sharpen up the question so I can give you a good answer.
Someone close the door.<eos> Hey, can I help you?<eos> We need a room for the night.<eos> They've had it with the car for today.<eos> Wow, what happened to you?
Or twice.<eos> Maybe even three times, but my son-in-law owns this house outright, and he's got prospects, and he respects his elders.<eos> There's plenty worse off than my daughter.<eos> Er, Mr Watts is not willing to allow Mrs Watts to remain in the property if the marriage is dissolved.<eos> I'm not paying you to know what my husband wants.
- Yeah, I agree!<eos> The behavior's unacceptable.<eos> And if Ms. Marillo will let me know the name of the individual who approached her last night...<eos> I don't know his name.<eos> And I only told you about this to make you realize that ignoring this isn't gonna make it go away.
I am in charge now.<eos> If you have questions or concerns,<eos> I suggest you take those up with your boss, who can take them up with his boss, who can take them up with my boss.<eos> Guess who my boss is.<eos> I will give you a hint.
Trust me, no one's going to be checking your passport.<eos> Come on, Amelia Earhart, let's go on an adventure.<eos> You coming?<eos> Mr. Anderson?<eos> I was hoping I could ask you a question.
How...<eos> These are the missing frames from the night of the killing. The ones Poseidon edited out.<eos> Yes, I was there. I've never denied it.<eos> He forced me to... so he could frame me.<eos> So the blood evidence found in your belongings was because he tasked you with disposing of the body.
I've shown you his face!<eos> Now, calm down.<eos> You should know that we have Mr. Ness' accomplice, Andrew Nelson, in custody, thanks to your brother,<eos> Once we saw your e-mail, we interrogated him.<eos> He's fully disclosed 21-Void's conspiracy to frame you for the murder of Harlan Gaines and bury your identity by giving you a new one: Kaniel Outis.
I should be talking to you?<eos> Terry McAlwain?<eos> Uh, yes. Yes.<eos> So, you've spoken to SymcoPetro.<eos> They'll pay you.
Uh, yes. Yes.<eos> So, you've spoken to SymcoPetro.<eos> They'll pay you.<eos> Did they tell you that?<eos> Whatever it is you want, they'll give it to you.
Don't be a silly.<eos> I only hope I didn't take too much of your time with all my dusty old photos.<eos> Goodness, no.<eos> Your... your grandson's wedding was gorgeous.<eos> When I come back, I'll show you my niece's confirmation.
It's so good to see you again.<eos> I escorted you and your clients onto my base.<eos> I treated you with hospitality and respect, and now I come to find every word out of your mouth is a damn lie.<eos> Captain, please. Why don't... Sit down.<eos> Take a load off. Hey, I'll get you a complimentary coffee or a soft drink?
The B-52 is, I presume, still...<eos> - B-29.<eos> - Huh? B-29. FIFI's a B-29.<eos> Oh, this is all just one big joke to you, huh?<eos> - You don't like the commercial.
They're an exceptional firm.<eos> Okay. Well, I will send that info over today.<eos> A-And Ms. W-Wexler will follow up herself shortly.<eos> "Thanks for the meat." Uh.<eos> A-And she says thank you for the steaks.
I don't...<eos> I-I don't know how to start this.<eos> Are you looking for a psychiatrist?<eos> I was in a bad accident... severely injured, and they tell me that you're the best at this kind of thing.<eos> Well, I should tell you, Mr...
Don't think I'll ever forget what happened here today.<eos> And you will pay.<eos> You can move the red five up.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Thank you, sir.
Yeah, patch that one through.<eos> Mr. Mcgill will take your call.<eos> Hey. Your new assistant's a real pip.<eos> Yeah, thanks for crushing her spirit on the first day.<eos> Thank you, sir.
Where the heck is it?<eos> Oh, don't worry.<eos> If it's in here, I'll... ah.<eos> There it is.<eos> May I clean this for you?
The jury found for the plaintiff.<eos> Nothing further.<eos> Detective, did the jury in that case conclude that you had planted evidence?<eos> - No.<eos> - Did the findings against you involve falsifying of evidence in any way?
I'll make it my mission.<eos> You are a dog with a bone.<eos> And you, Mrs. Allen, are a liar and a murderer.<eos> You really do need to get a life, detective.<eos> I still owe you that drink.
Did mayor Queen say why?<eos> He said the Throwing Star Killer, a man we'd been calling Prometheus, manipulated him.<eos> Did he say why this Prometheus would want to orchestrate Detective Malone's murder?<eos> No.<eos> Standing here today, do you believe what Mr. Queen has told you?
I'm pregnant.<eos> I should have killed you when I had the chance.<eos> I won't make that mistake again, huh?<eos> (DRAMATIC MUSIC) _<eos> I guess I should thank you.
Question about a find... Seventeen.<eos> I'm wondering if there's any new information since?<eos> I see.<eos> So he was seen in St. John's?<eos> I'm gonna show you some pictures.
Did you?<eos> All right, Jack.<eos> Professor. Gary in HR will set you up.<eos> Enjoy your new offices.<eos> Thank you, sir.
Excuse me. Coming through. Excuse me.<eos> Praise well deserved, Mr. Mayor.<eos> I really think we need to cash in on this good news immediately.<eos> You are a clever fellow, Tarquin, but... I wish Ed were here.<eos> My sole job as deputy chief of staff is to serve you with the exact same zeal and smarts as Mr. Nygma would.
I think you're being a little tough on your son.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Well, it's obvious why he didn't tell you right away.<eos> I mean, look at the way you're reacting.<eos> Maybe if you just listen and... and hear his reasons and try to see things from his point of view... maybe... maybe you'd understand why he didn't tell you... before now.
That didn't take long.<eos> Not to let light in upon the magic, but it really wasn't that difficult.<eos> My invoice is in there also. Right.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I've given you a 50% discount in light of your circumstances.
What caused you to leave there and head to the garage?<eos> I don't want to discuss it.<eos> Mr. Burnett, let's be clear about one thing.<eos> This is not a discussion.<eos> This is a formal police interview, after which we will decide whether or not to charge you.
- I popped round last night.<eos> - Without asking?<eos> - I didn't wanna bother Trish.<eos> I know she doesn't wanna see me but I've got a back door key.<eos> Why do you need the computer?
That moral argument had all the apocryphal insight of Thurgood Marshall and the moral aplomb of Ida B. Wells.<eos> It was thoroughly impressive and utterly convincing.<eos> And I am happy to say that because Violet, who is right-handed, signed the document with her left hand, the marriage is invalid.<eos> Well, you may not be my wife, but you are still my daughter.<eos> Do you honestly believe I will allow you to continue to care for these three children after the treachery I've seen here tonight?
Yes. Uh, well, enjoy the show, ma'am.<eos> - Dr. Montgomery!<eos> - Hello, old chap!<eos> Two adults, three minors.<eos> I'm giving you the Verified Film Discount.
Will you please watch your mail for a letter from my office?<eos> Yes, Jimmy from TV.<eos> Really? Were you the pilot of the B-29?<eos> 32 missions?<eos> Well, c-can I just say, sir, that you are one of the people who made the greatest generation so damn great?
Now, that's only fair, right?<eos> I'm sorry, Mr. mcgill. It doesn't work like that.<eos> We don't refund for unused malpractice insurance.<eos> But it's a -- it's a lot of money for nothing.<eos> I understand it seems that way, but if one of your clients decides they want to bring a suit against you, this continues your coverage.
Sir.<eos> I need you to show me your hands.<eos> Yep.<eos> - Aah.<eos> - What happened to you?
Yeah. I'll... Yeah, I'll take it.<eos> - You sure?<eos> - Yeah. $32.65?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Thank you, sir.
- Mr. Farrell.<eos> - Hold on a second.<eos> - I-I was told that I...<eos> - Mr. Farrell, sir.<eos> I'm not sure Ms. Bennett explained to you
How are you, my love?<eos> Oh, it's good to see you.<eos> Mr Reed?<eos> I'm Reverend Hereward.<eos> Nurse Mount thought you might like some company while you wait.
Then help me.<eos> Come to the Coroner's Court. Tell them that men like you should be protected.<eos> Stand up like this?<eos> No. Never.<eos> Tell them what this accident has done to you, to Arthur.
Wait.<eos> October 4th, October 4th... was the day Cyrus won the vice presidential debates.<eos> Admiral Ballard didn't have a problem with free college when it was his college.<eos> He just doesn't want other Americans to have the same opportunities he had.<eos> Admiral Ballard, given your roots, I expected a little more from you.
No. I'm not accusing you of...<eos> You might not be, but your friend here keeps acting like it's a crime I'm still alive.<eos> We're just trying to piece things together.<eos> Just to make sure that everything adds up.<eos> Want me to get you a calculator?
- I was a runner.<eos> You ever get away for long? Once.<eos> For six weeks.<eos> If you think of anything.<eos> When you ran, how far'd you make it?
Sharkey's been here, in and out, over a year.<eos> He knows the rules.<eos> And what about the sign-in?<eos> Does that have phone numbers too?<eos> Most of the numbers are phony, but I can give you what I got.
Why are they pulling us over?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> All right, just be cool.<eos> Good evening.<eos> Do you know why I pulled you over?
- I got this.<eos> All right.<eos> All right, people, let's start from the top.<eos> You heard the lady.<eos> If you'll sign right here, I'll have someone take your bags to your room for you.
But I would imagine you still have significant concerns regarding Ms. Bailey having regular, unsupervised visits...<eos> Objection.<eos> Leading the witness.<eos> Sustained.<eos> Mr. Gutteman, may I remind you that your job requires you to be an impartial advocate for your young client?
You, in the other room right now.<eos> I have a day job. I have actual, meaningful work to do.<eos> She is your problem now.<eos> Admiral Ballard, given your roots,<eos> I expected a little more from you.
That's wonderful!<eos> Wherever did you find it?<eos> William?<eos> Hand over my property.<eos> - She felt sorry for you.
I know the name of the girl who visited you for an hour and a half at 9:35pm.<eos> I also know that you ordered the Lobster de la Manche.<eos> - Are you trying to blackmail me?<eos> - No, Mr. Briggs.<eos> I'm trying to impress you.
I need you, for once in your bloody life, to be a son to me. Help me.<eos> Please, I need your help.<eos> I'm glad you're here, there were some things I wanted to discuss with you.<eos> No, this isn't a good time for that.<eos> I've been instructed to tell you that we're letting you go.
Some pathetic creature that can be mocked and cast aside.<eos> I'm going to prove them wrong.<eos> That's heartbreaking stuff.<eos> I still don't see what it's got to do with me.<eos> Have a seat and I'll tell you.
About joining with Germany.<eos> People? What people?<eos> Right now, they think I'm here acting as your friend.<eos> Gathering information, finding out if you are involved in something bigger.<eos> I don't... I don't believe you, they could be anyone.
But this will pass.<eos> You will survive, you will be stronger.<eos> I give you my word.<eos> I have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> And I believe I told you to leave, Mr. Garland.
What about you, Mr. Fowwkes?<eos> Well, we're ready to proceed to trial, Your Honor.<eos> Then we'll schedule voir dire to commence next week.<eos> Did you forget about me?<eos> Nobody stopped in to offer you coffee, water?
Fucking guy.<eos> Leave a message.<eos> Mr. Taylor, Jerry Edgar.<eos> We got disconnected.<eos> I wanted to ask you a few questions about my partner Harry Bosch.
You know he will be.<eos> Six months before he regains full use and mobility.<eos> He's going to be riding a desk for awhile.<eos> I have to give a statement.<eos> That's what they pay you the big bucks for.
The case is still carried as open.<eos> I cleared it to my satisfaction.<eos> The killer's dead.<eos> I just never got around to filing it cleared other.<eos> Did Caffrey help you clear it?
What a rarified world you live in, Ms. Rhoades.<eos> Did something else happen to increase your value to Axelrod?<eos> Such as?<eos> Did you provide him information?<eos> I'm not sure what you mean.
Highly irregular.<eos> In your world.<eos> Not in this one.<eos> I don't think a judge or jury is likely to discount the linkage.<eos> My client allowed you here as a courtesy.
I don't think so.<eos> Then I have the right to know why.<eos> And I'm not going anywhere until you tell me.<eos> Sorry we weren't able to land you at night and spare you the shock of our sun and sky, but the Navy had fly-over restrictions in effect.<eos> I hope the strain of Earth's gravity hasn't been too much for you to bear.
- Why pick on me? - Well, I noticed you.<eos> Yeah, but why?<eos> Well, most people when don't understand something, they frown.<eos> You... smile.<eos> I'll tell you what I don't understand.
You've been lecturing here for a long time. 50 years, some people say.<eos> Nabeela in the office says over 70.<eos> And you're thinking, "Well, he doesn't look old enough"?<eos> No. I'm wondering what you're supposed to be lecturing on.<eos> It's like the university let you do whatever you like.
As may be. But it did not come from within Cowley General.<eos> - You all right, sir? - It's nothing.<eos> Overwork.<eos> I'm due a holiday.<eos> Your hands would shake too if you had my lists.
I'm taking you to dinner.<eos> - This place is creepy.<eos> - Yeah, well, so are we.<eos> Yeah?<eos> I'm just gonna give you $100, and that's just for opening the door.
I suggest you take me back now.<eos> We're not taking you back.<eos> You're under arrest.<eos> Burkhardt's a dead man.<eos> Whatever happens to Nick is gonna happen to you.
It was like a... like a monster.<eos> It was a monster.<eos> I know... I know you think<eos> I know you think I'm crazy, but I'm not.<eos> - We're gonna help you.
- We can take you there.<eos> I don't know who you are.<eos> I want my wife!<eos> Sir, we're your friends.<eos> We're here to help you.
Another corn ship raided, two young tackers shot.<eos> Unwin assures me it's only a matter of time before Dr Enys will be released.<eos> And in the meantime, he receives the best possible treatment.<eos> Did I not order you to rest, Lieutenant Armitage?<eos> And who would order you to rest?
if she thinks I have confidence in her, not that you don't have confidence in me.<eos> - you're back.<eos> - You better believe I'm back, because I looked into what you're doing<eos> - There's really not much to find, Mr. specter.<eos> - Well, let me lay it out for you.
We had a little trouble at the bank, and I'm advising everybody to exercise caution till it's resolved.<eos> All right, will do.<eos> And...<eos> Drive carefully.<eos> Thank you, sir.
Again, that wasn't me.<eos> Pay phones?<eos> Aren't pay phones a thing of the past?<eos> All due respect, my son is misremembering the night.<eos> And Danny handing you his cell and you walking around the outside of the Harbor Grill pretending to try to make a phone call... is your son misremembering all that, too?
He's a retired detective with 30 years of experience. In la policia de montevid.<eos> And this is his very first visit here from uruguay.<eos> Hi.<eos> - Bienvenido, senor.<eos> How are you enjoying los angeles?
I got word that you called.<eos> I assume you spoke with my attorney,<eos> Monsieur Ron Laflamme?<eos> Yes, I did speak to Ron Laflamme.<eos> What, pray tell, did he tell you when he called you?
Those signs that you talked about earlier...<eos> The sadness in the eyes, the clenched jaw...<eos> I don't see them.<eos> I'd like to know why they elude me.<eos> You know, I might have some literature in my office that could illuminate some of this stuff for you.
I'm sorry.<eos> This promo video has been a huge violation in your privacy.<eos> I know you were hesitant to sign the release, so...<eos> You rip that up if you want,<eos> And we will not use any of the footage. Let me ask you a question, dr.
She had to leave.<eos> It turns out that the whole thing was just a big, old mistake.<eos> This is too much. I only had $200.<eos> Yeah, she just felt terrible about the whole thing.<eos> She wanted to buy you dinner.
All right, we've got a rhythm.<eos> He's back. He's back.<eos> Quite a turnaround.<eos> I know, right?<eos> I was worried I wouldn't be able to pull it off. As smoothly as you, but it worked out.
It's tied.<eos> I-i'm not crazy, sarah.<eos> I-I'm not.<eos> Surgery turned out well today.<eos> Thanks to you, dr. Rhodes.
Definitely a heart attack.<eos> Ever had any heart problems before?<eos> Little chest pain here and there.<eos> My doc's got me on some pills.<eos> Okay, well, he should've told you not to jump in a frozen river.
You're a fine surgeon, and trust me, I'm a less than perfect teacher.<eos> Mr. Adams, can I ask you, um... You ever find yourself doing something that you know you shouldn't, but you just can't stop?<eos> I have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> My wife would say that I... I watch too much football.<eos> Can I tell you my dirty little secret?
Yeah, making it my priority.<eos> I know this is hard, but... you need to take care of yourself.<eos> All right? Especially with... everything that you're going through.<eos> Appreciate your concern. Thank you, I'm fine.<eos> Just... at least let me give you something to help you sleep.
Detective, don't make me fill in the blanks.<eos> Early indications are that your son was harmed before he died.<eos> What does that mean? Harmed?<eos> There are signs that...<eos> Mr. Curry, it's easy to believe that these details will help you to move forward but that's not always the case.
Good night, Harvey.<eos> I'll see you tomorrow at the hearing.<eos> Mr. Ross, we are prepared to hear your final statement.<eos> Before we do, I have one last question.<eos> Mr. Ross, you say you're a changed man and you care about the truth.
Mr. Ross, we are prepared to hear your final statement.<eos> Before we do, I have one last question.<eos> Mr. Ross, you say you're a changed man and you care about the truth.<eos> But I want to know if you're capable of telling the truth.<eos> So I'm going to ask you a question and I suggest that you consider your answer very carefully, because as far as I'm concerned, your answer will determine whether or not you become a lawyer.
- Where is he?<eos> - He's in my head.<eos> He's not in your head.<eos> You're working with him.<eos> - He's given you information.
What?<eos> He asked if I knew her.<eos> Spent time with her.<eos> I had.<eos> Of course, I didn't tell him anything about it, but I could tell you.
There. That's the manual override.<eos> - Are you sure?<eos> - Just hold the tablet still.<eos> Shit.<eos> I'm wondering who you have handling tech on Roger's murder investigation.
Later I realized the whole thing wasn't about you beating Krakow.<eos> It was about breaking him and having her watch him go on tilt.<eos> Breaking him was the only way to beat him.<eos> Was it?<eos> Mr. McKinnon, I'm sorry to put you through this.
Objection.<eos> Calls for speculation.<eos> Objection is sustained.<eos> Okay, we'll move on.<eos> After Lillian Luthor saved you, did she order you to work for Cadmus?
I believe aliens should be wiped from the Earth.<eos> Starting with Supergirl and her cousin.<eos> I hate him.<eos> He literally has no heart.<eos> And what, if anything, did Lillian Luthor tell you about the Medusa Project?
Sorry to pull you over, but I saw you have a broken taillight.<eos> I do?<eos> Sorry, Officer.<eos> Lucky for you, I have some tape for that.<eos> Come on, I'll help you put it on.
We'll know for certain when the DNA comes back.<eos> The cause of death was blunt force trauma to the head.<eos> Looks like she was dumped there.<eos> That's horrible and disturbing.<eos> Look, I just came by to let you know before it gets all official.
- Sir?<eos> LeAnn will contact you about when to send out the fix.<eos> -You'll wait for her.<eos> -Okay, but just to be--<eos> She'll let you know.
And is he the kind of man who would knowingly participate in campaign finance fraud?<eos> I wouldn't say that, exactly. No.<eos> How well do you know President Underwood, sir?<eos> I've known the president four years.<eos> Isn't it a fact that it was Francis Underwood and not President Walker who first suggested you should resign?
Yes.<eos> You, too.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> Thank you, Felix.<eos> Uh, would you like me to prepare it for you, sir?
I know.<eos> Lawrence Boyd?<eos> You're under arrest.<eos> You have the right to remain silent.<eos> Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
Whereas me...<eos> - Yes.<eos> I'm not the Intermediate Schools 400-metre champion I once was.<eos> Yet it's only taken me, what, 12 minutes to get from the science block to here.<eos> Whereas you, on Monday, took a full 25 minutes to get from here to the science block.
A remarkable... unprecedented offer on the table.<eos> Well, you tell the governor it ain't good enough.<eos> - Me?<eos> - Yes. You know what happened in here.<eos> You got to tell him. He'll believe you.
I do remember.<eos> Of course I remember. I didn't think you wanted talk about it.<eos> We lived through it.<eos> That's enough, isn't it?<eos> I never got to thank you and tell you--
Macclesfield estate, block by block search outwards.<eos> - And I want vision.<eos> - Leave it with me, Minister.<eos> Thank you, Mr. Mclntyre.<eos> I'll organize someone to help you pack up your desk.
Too close to call, Clive.<eos> Good afternoon.<eos> And how may I be of assistance?<eos> Um, S-Saul Gold, please.<eos> Mr. Gold is occupied, but I'd be more than happy to help you with any inquiry you may have.
Standing on the right side of the law.<eos> There's a twist for you.<eos> Clearly not the side you're familiar with.<eos> These men don't talk, Detective.<eos> Well, if Bianchi's so sure about that, why are you in such a rush?
Well, there's the two murders your dad covered up.<eos> You really don't know your dad, do you?<eos> Hi, Mr. Clark.<eos> This is Cristina Santos.<eos> I was thinking maybe I could help you with information to track down my dad.
Nice added feature.<eos> Are you sure this detour can't wait?<eos> Verco's out for blood.<eos> I wouldn't ask if it wasn't timely.<eos> Thank you, sir.
What time is it, Mr. Beaumont?<eos> That's right, sir... the Grove Clinic.<eos> The ulcer trial.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thank you, sir.
The what?<eos> Charlotte's toy chest. The one I made her.<eos> How is that a priority? Okay?<eos> Sir! I want you to give me one example.<eos> I want you to tell me one example of someone who said,
I called the Chicago PD earlier today.<eos> Seems your business partner and his girlfriend disappeared just before you moved to my little jurisdictional paradise here.<eos> You have anything to tell me about that?<eos> Got nothing to say that we haven't already told the authorities.<eos> I'm gonna give you the simplest, most neighborly advice I can give.
- Demons and evil thrive on discord intention.<eos> Is there any of that in your home?<eos> - Yeah, for quite a while, now.<eos> My wife was killed in a drunk driving accident and my daughter has never forgiven me.<eos> - Why does she need to forgive you?
Oh, my God.<eos> Well, I would just soak it in Clorox and wait for the swelling to go down.<eos> Hey now.<eos> "Hey now"?<eos> May I remind you you are addressing an officer of the court?
What's on your mind, Sergeant?<eos> My dad.<eos> He's going to be very disappointed in you.<eos> You should prepare for that.<eos> He told you that story? About the climbing accident?
However, this just validates my suspicion.<eos> What could be a bigger story than the twins proven as Simon's children?<eos> That Robert is still alive.<eos> You know how absurd that sounds, right?<eos> Perhaps I'll let you run the story.
But by this point, it's a pretty deep farm system.<eos> I've been drafting blue-chippers, high upsides, and reclamations for three decades.<eos> So why should I sign you off the street?<eos> I think you're confused.<eos> I'm not trying to sell myself to you.
Well, we're sort of<eos> - still trying to figure that one out.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> We're gonna hunt for him today.<eos> But we just wanted... well, we just wanted to give you an update.
You don't believe me, do you?<eos> I'm a bit more inclined to believe something medical.<eos> A virus. "Zombies" is a bit of a leap.<eos> What do you call that?<eos> Are you sure your brother didn't just send you a picture from a zombie movie?
Thank you, Dr. Wallace.<eos> Happy to provide a diversion from the serious stuff.<eos> Well, managing scientists is like herding cats.<eos> You gave me some good points.<eos> - Can I get you a drink?
We had a laugh, you know?<eos> - Ah.<eos> - Teasing, bit of banter.<eos> That's all.<eos> She confide in you?
He knows what he did.<eos> Well, I imagine he does, but Mr. Kidnapper, you and I both know he's the kind of man who spits on you and calls it rain.<eos> Hm.<eos> Lormong Vang thinks he can take whatever he wants.<eos> Did he take something from you?
Hm.<eos> Lormong Vang thinks he can take whatever he wants.<eos> Did he take something from you?<eos> Everything.<eos> He did that to you?
Sir, we need to operate as soon as possible.<eos> Okay. I understand.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - We'll start prepping the O.R.<eos> Thank you, sir.
You're reacting, not leading.<eos> But it's like I said... you were simply outgunned.<eos> So don't be too hard on yourself.<eos> I won't, Mr. President.<eos> I'll let you take care of that.
How are you going to help people like me from getting pushed out of our homes?<eos> Carol, thank you for asking the question.<eos> You're absolutely right.<eos> Recent studies have shown that housing prices have gone up exponentially over the last three years, especially in our major cities. I'm sorry, sir.<eos> Can I stop you there?
If we get a whiff of tax cuts for the rich or cuts to Medicare or Social Security, we will back out of this bill.<eos> You have my word, Senator. I'm right there with you.<eos> Good.<eos> And good luck, Mr. President.<eos> I'm afraid you're going to need it.
Well, if you swing that in the budget, I think I can swing Harrington.<eos> I'll confirm within the hour.<eos> If you can't find your spine on this... I may just run for the damn seat myself.<eos> There's no need to overreact.<eos> It's really that important to you?
Civil rights, immigration, campaign-finance reform.<eos> Without a court to adjudicate the laws of this land, we are a broken government, sir.<eos> Now, this was a fair deal.<eos> Every single person in this room has something to claim victory over.<eos> I'm not gonna let you hijack that, sir.
I know I'm not the negotiator that you are...<eos> Ah, don't sell yourself short. You know, we may have different styles, Tom, but I think that's what makes us a good team.<eos> The professor and the politician.<eos> You give them the facts, and I'll twist their arms.<eos> That works for me. I know how important this is to you.
I put my legacy on the line for you!<eos> And this is how you repay me?<eos> I thought I had it handled.<eos> Well, you were wrong. You were dead wrong, and now my head is on the block right along with yours!<eos> Well, I probably should've let you in.
I am talking about the mothers.<eos> Everything is going to change the moment this first child is born.<eos> Surely, you have a plan for dealing with their reactions.<eos> Honestly, sir, I don't see how it's gonna be so different.<eos> Perhaps you should have your wife explain it to you.
Everything is going to change the moment this first child is born.<eos> Surely, you have a plan for dealing with their reactions.<eos> Honestly, sir, I don't see how it's gonna be so different.<eos> Perhaps you should have your wife explain it to you.<eos> Or perhaps I take something important from you to help you better understand.
But let's get serious for a minute.<eos> Toby, after we installed the stint, we ran some tests.<eos> The arrhythmia was caused by a minor septal defect, which means there's a very small hole between two of the heart's chambers.<eos> Now some people may choose, uh, not to repair the hole, and treat it with medication. But I strongly suggest surgery.<eos> Let me explain to you exactly what's going on.
Uh... sure.<eos> Okay, come on, George.<eos> Let's give this young man the booth.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> Tell you what, let me help you out there, 'cause she's gonna be coming in hot any minute now.
We're saved!<eos> We are saved!<eos> Oh, my goodness.<eos> What a relief.<eos> We don't know how to thank you.
- Mmm. It's been years.<eos> - Tell me, truck driver...<eos> - I said my name was Evander.<eos> Did you ever know a woman, truck driver, who took your heart and rattled it like a baby in a cage?<eos> Who joined you for years on a sequence of heists and schemes until the two of you were forced apart by circumstance, and also because you ran off in the middle of the night with a bunch of her valuables?
I guess it makes sense, given Ethan.<eos> Ethan was a mistake.<eos> The overseas account was opened in Tommy's name by his former employers.<eos> I have access to $3 million.<eos> So, how can we help you, Mr...?
Well, that's all I know about it.<eos> I haven't got any more orphans concealed hereabouts.<eos> I, uh...<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Well, I'm sure the girl will be only too happy to tell you every little detail of what happened.
Are you on the lam? !<eos> Alex. I can help you, but, I mean, I have kids here.<eos> Stop it.<eos> I went down there. I talked to the D.A.<eos> I have to advise you, Dr. Karev, that talking to you without your lawyer present just isn't...
We still need to run some tests, but it appears as though you are cancer-free.<eos> What's your name again?<eos> Hemostasis was established, and the patient was sent to post-op without complications.<eos> Dr. Webber?<eos> May I, uh... may I run something by you?
- Was I there?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I did most of it.<eos> DeLuca, take her to C.T. - and page me when she's done. - All right.<eos> Dr. Clatch, I'll be happy to show you where you can wait, okay?
Hi. Are you here for Diane?<eos> I'm Diane's assistant, but I also sometimes work as an investigator.<eos> Would you like to come back?<eos> Yes.<eos> Can I get you anything?
Please, sit down.<eos> Why, didn't you give your name?<eos> Well, I was worried you wouldn't want me as a client.<eos> I wanted to get a chance to argue my case. That's crazy.<eos> Why wouldn't I want you as a client?
The witness is right here now.<eos> Let's go.<eos> You had a meeting with Lucca Quinn, did you not, Mr. AUSA?<eos> I did.<eos> And what did she give you?
And he used us to get it past the government firewall.<eos> The malware needed to infect a DOJ computer, and you used us to do it!<eos> - No. No.<eos> - Yes!<eos> I don't believe you.
- No.<eos> We're your lawyers.<eos> We didn't know who would show up.<eos> Sir, you have the right to remain silent.<eos> Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
I'll leave that analysis to others.<eos> Analysis. What...<eos> "The Friedman Method" "is a banned coercive technique of interrogation" "that results in too many false confessions."<eos> "It is therefore banned within our jurisdiction."<eos> Do you mean analysis like that?
Mr. Rindell?<eos> Hello.<eos> I'm Mike Kresteva.<eos> Okay. Do I know you?<eos> No, but I think I can help you.
Okay. Nothing further.<eos> Mr. Boseman, a word.<eos> I hear your firm is looking to branch out into other areas of expertise.<eos> We're always looking for opportunities.<eos> Well, if you don't mind some unsolicited advice...
See, if we debate politics,<eos> - we lose.<eos> - _<eos> He's trying to make it about us, you see.<eos> What do you need?
My goodness, what kind of monster do you think I am?<eos> I'm talking about taking her out of the debate.<eos> And how do you take someone out of a debate?<eos> I don't know. Shout her down, embarrass her.<eos> Why do you need funds for that?
Why do you need funds for that?<eos> Why do you need funds for that dress?<eos> Because I don't want to end up in that jacket.<eos> Oh! I will see you in court.<eos> Again, why do you need funds to shut someone down?
This whole mess with Staples needs to end.<eos> He's got too many followers, and they're threatening to leave my services, so make it end.<eos> We've reconsidered.<eos> "Reconsidered"?<eos> We're prepared to overturn the ban and reinstate you.
The only reason he's trying to kick me out is because I ended it...<eos> Because I don't want a 70-year-old dick in my mouth.<eos> Shut up and listen.<eos> You have until noon tomorrow to vacate the premises.<eos> Do you need any help finding other accommodations?
Oh, I don't know. She gets tea from a lot of different places.<eos> That's okay. I can just ask her tomorrow morning, before I go.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Have a good night.<eos> - You too.
Away from the monitors and the blood and the... and the sterile gowns, away from saving other people's lives.<eos> I want my own. It's time... It's time I live my own.<eos> You changed my life, Dr. Webber.<eos> You have.<eos> Thank you. Thank you. I think I found it.
I'm not gonna do that.<eos> You're not gonna do that.<eos> I'm not.<eos> Well...<eos> That being the case, I'd be happy to help you with your mother.
No.<eos> No, what, Clive?<eos> No, thank you.<eos> And who would this client be, Mr. Baker?<eos> You know I can't tell you that, Detective.
Sir.<eos> I'm going to ask for a meeting with the Deputy AG.<eos> I want him to stop this thing.<eos> You have a self-destructive streak, Agent Beeman.<eos> I'm telling you because I went behind my boss's back before--
You have a self-destructive streak, Agent Beeman.<eos> I'm telling you because I went behind my boss's back before--<eos> And you didn't feel good about it.<eos> Thank you for informing me.<eos> No, I'm telling you in case you want to be there.
My truck is all the way over in the South lot.<eos> I told you I need that work order.<eos> I don't get overtime if I have to come back for this.<eos> Just cut a guy a break, please?<eos> I need two minutes to finish, and I will show you my work order.
But Garcia's not, otherwise he would've bolted as soon as we found out he was using the West family to launder the money.<eos> Why is he still here?<eos> Listen, I'd love nothing more than to bring Garcia to justice, but we both know we don't have enough evidence.<eos> Which is why stopping him and the Natal from using New Orleans as a base of operations will have to be good enough.<eos> Well, it's not good enough for me, and it shouldn't be for you, either.
We might have left out the part about it not being lethal or contagious.<eos> Given the nature of the virus you chose, we assume you never meant for anyone to die.<eos> But Thorpe murdered Schmitt while committing your crime.<eos> His flight should be landing in a couple of hours.<eos> We'll have people there to pick him up, which leaves you plenty of time to cut the first deal.
A cop was murdered. You understand that, right?<eos> Yes.<eos> And I'm sorry that that happened.<eos> Believe me, I want to help...<eos> I don't think you are. I don't think you are sorry, all right?
What say you?<eos> We find the defendant,<eos> Gordon Guthrie... Not guilty.<eos> I can't believe it.<eos> I told you.
I deal in absolutes.<eos> If I could somehow provide information that led to the gauntlet's recovery, what would it be worth to the Global Authority?<eos> You're asking that as a representative of the Governor-General?<eos> Today, I'm representing myself.<eos> If you were to be the one to lead us to the gauntlet, I promise you, Mr. Snyder, you'll never want for anything again.
Trashed?<eos> There were big, scary goons staking out his house.<eos> They chased my ass across campus.<eos> Now either this is an amazing coincidence, or I'm onto something that someone, somewhere, doesn't want public.<eos> I'm telling you, Mr. Tanz, the sky is falling.
It'll be a few hours, I'm afraid.<eos> If you're in a hurry, you might find a better mode.<eos> Shall we ask the matron?<eos> No, no, no, this will be perfect.<eos> And I'm sorry I don't have any money to pay you, but I'll be happy to help.
How many people can say that they were... They, they knew someone Who had been shot dead?<eos> It's got to be down to 0.000001% of the population, hasn't it?<eos> It can't be very many people... And then I asked myself how many People can say that they were there. When that person they Knew were shot dead, and...<eos> It's got to be even fewer.<eos> And I have to say it to You, sir, it is just...
That's no way to go.<eos> No. No, it isn't.<eos> - Who's that?<eos> - That must be the husband of the woman who does the cooking.<eos> Well, I don't envy you this afternoon, Chief.
Get him down!<eos> Why did you try and kill yourself?<eos> If I'm in here, I cannot protect her.<eos> And I'm in here for good now, aren't I?<eos> If you help me, I can help you.
Did you?<eos> No.<eos> You may go back to your search now, Chief Inspector Maigret.<eos> Carl believes that if he reads the Bible to me I will sleep the peace of the righteous, but I often need a little help.<eos> Don't you?
You think?<eos> Or you know?<eos> Derek Jones.<eos> Yvonne Turner with Fox 6 News.<eos> I was hoping I could ask you a few questions about the riot that happened a week ago?
I was hoping he could help me with a case.<eos> 18 months ago, my son was assaulted by a man in a ski mask outside a deli in Queens.<eos> They tell me Mr. Holmes is the secret weapon of the NYPD.<eos> I was hoping he could help identify my son's attacker.<eos> Um, I'd really love to help you, but we're smack in the middle of something.
- Well done.<eos> - What a charming oversimplification.<eos> Tell me something, how do you live with such an unimaginative reductionist view of the world?<eos> How is life, without the resonance of beauty, even worth the effort?<eos> Let me tell you a little something about beauty, Mr. Hobbs.
May we approach, Your Honor?<eos> In light of the People's failure to disclose the romantic relationship between this witness and the victim, I move to exclude all of her testimony.<eos> First of all, we know of no romantic relationship.<eos> All due respect, Mr. Stone, I'm ready to put the bartender from Sheridan's on the stand.<eos> I'm sure she told you exactly what she told me.
- Etihad.<eos> - How hot are the planes?<eos> - Very warm.<eos> Well, there's a new rule.<eos> I'm telling you.
A full-bird colonel.<eos> You don't even outrank the speechwriter.<eos> You don't have to say "even".<eos> I am, in fact, a major general.<eos> As such, I'm giving you a direct order:
Perhaps the communication division?<eos> Too obvious.<eos> Whoever this spy is, they have a method of transmitting that we are, as yet, unaware of.<eos> If I can do anything to help...<eos> I'll let you know.
My child.<eos> I've been watching you for a long time.<eos> You have been a great comfort, my child.<eos> Now, remove that bell and forgive yourself.<eos> - Thank you, sir.
People are sick and tired of all this confusion and chaos.<eos> The public is not happy.<eos> If you become president, would Claire Underwood remain as vice president?<eos> Not if she wants what's best for the country.<eos> But given the Twelfth Amendment, would you have a choice?
This is everything?<eos> This is everything they sent from Zoe's apartment.<eos> I just, you know... I just can't seem to throw anything out.<eos> I mean, it's just papers, but...<eos> Anyway, I'll leave you to it.
Well, if we're Americans, then we are salesmen, right?<eos> That's our birthright. Cars and phones and a gallon of gas.<eos> That's not how I see America.<eos> I'm a patriot. I serve.<eos> Well, then, we salute you, General.
So tell me. How do you feel now?<eos> Congratulations, Mr. President.<eos> Before I forget, LeAnn Harvey wanted me to say hello.<eos> How is she?<eos> Well, she wanted me to tell you that she's... she's all right. She's gonna be all right.
I want direct access. Live streaming.<eos> I assure you, Mr. President, we'll bring you anything of substance.<eos> Do it.<eos> And needless to say...<eos> I report only to you, sir.
We lose it all.<eos> Tell the chair I'm ready to appear.<eos> I mean, the damage your testimony could do to your wife is not worth the risk.<eos> Oh, its worth is what we're here to discuss.<eos> I don't appreciate being the one to tell you this, but... your presidency is beyond repair.
Oh, Congressman Romero, I just wanted to see you one last time before I leave.<eos> I don't believe there's anything left to be said. No, not between us.<eos> Not any longer.<eos> I just wanted to thank you for... your tenacity.
- I don't mind.<eos> What would you like to know?<eos> - Is there somewhere private...<eos> - Before you get started, Detective, I also have a question.<eos> It might save us all a lot of time and you a lot of bother.
Caroline McGovern, isn't it?<eos> Well, not much.<eos> Last I heard she was working in some tavern.<eos> May I keep this?<eos> How much did the Hobbins offer you to let them go?
Get your hands off me, sonny boy.<eos> Is it common practice to let murderers out of jail?<eos> You're no murderer, Mr. Nash.<eos> Don't be ridiculous.<eos> You may have persuaded the Warden to release the Hobbins men to you, but you didn't kill them.
We're not getting on that seat anyway. Well, who is?<eos> First time out, huh?<eos> You know where I can find the rig manager?<eos> Keep up.<eos> I'll show you.
Came to pay my respects.<eos> Could've done that at the house.<eos> There's also something I thought you should know about Trevor.<eos> If it's something I'd rather not hear...<eos> The Navy didn't tell you the truth about Omega.
What do you mean?<eos> Well, he was marrying your ex-girlfriend,<eos> Mia Jones, correct?<eos> Yes, but-<eos> - Did you tell Mr. Stone that you're still in love with Mia before he offered you the deal of the century?
I need to be sharp.<eos> We've got work to do.<eos> And after this, find Al-Khatib and continue your cleanup.<eos> It's been going very well so far.<eos> Thank you, sir.
Sir?<eos> Hashem Al-Khatib.<eos> Frontenac must have messed up.<eos> You're still with us.<eos> And I'd like to keep it that way, by offering you something that you value far, far more than me.
Okay, this is crazy.<eos> The posts that you're referring to,<eos> Raina told me about them weeks ago.<eos> She regretted them and thought there might be consequences.<eos> But I'm gonna tell you exactly what I told her.
And if you tell anyone who I am, you're gonna have more than one Capone to worry about.<eos> Did you know that he takes ads out in newspapers, looking for you?<eos> All over the country, for years.<eos> He misses you.<eos> I understand how hard it must be for you to face him.
Only by reputation.<eos> Former Navy SEAL, commander of JAG, close friend of Hetty Lange.<eos> I thought you had retired, sir.<eos> So did I, but Henrietta called, said she was in trouble, so here I am, once more in the breach.<eos> Well, we are happy to have you, sir.
Understood.<eos> So this was all for the greater good?<eos> It's my job to do things other people won't or can't do for the greater good.<eos> It's interesting that you say it was your job, Detective Banks.<eos> - Did the city pay you to do it?
I need to ask you a question.<eos> Yes?<eos> Do you really think that I'm gonna fall for this?<eos> Do you think that anyone is gonna fall for this?<eos> I don't know what this Dr. Gray did to hurt you and I am sorry, I really am, but... that wasn't me.
He waived his rights against self-incrimination.<eos> - Your Honor...<eos> - Clever, Mr. Stone.<eos> Very clever.<eos> I'll probably be reversed on appeal, but I'm gonna let you cross-examine him, but only as to the matters that he testified to on direct.
- Clever, Mr. Stone.<eos> Very clever.<eos> I'll probably be reversed on appeal, but I'm gonna let you cross-examine him, but only as to the matters that he testified to on direct.<eos> I assume you're gonna need time to prepare your client, Mr. Forest.<eos> I'll give you 24 hours.
I mean, I didn't even know that Jack was out.<eos> He hasn't tried to contact you, or call you?<eos> No, nothing.<eos> You really think that he killed Karen Decker, just because she testified against him?<eos> That's what we're trying to find out, Mr. Mitchell, but if he did, you could be in danger, too.
Look, if anything, Jack owes me.<eos> I got the D.A. to agree to a reduced sentence based on Jack's mental state.<eos> I mean, I saved his life.<eos> Why would he be after me?<eos> We're not sure he is, Mr. Mitchell, but we're gonna get you protection just in case.
At the time, yeah.<eos> I mean, I know how much he loved her.<eos> Jack struggled with paranoia and delusions his whole life.<eos> I thought he had it under control.<eos> Is that what the D.A. got you to say in court? Yeah.
Dayana online.<eos> Logan Martin is taking a nice propofol-assisted nap in the backseat.<eos> So, you're clear to go, Ryan.<eos> Jon Jeffries, Omaha Pension.<eos> Thank you, sir.
Your clock's broken, Mr. Gephardt.<eos> That is what I'm supposed to call you, isn't it?<eos> It is my name.<eos> Well, you work for Defense Intelligence.<eos> I-I just thought that, um, an agency that makes the CIA look like the model of transparency might've furnished you with an alias.
So I wonder, do you really think you're here to question me?<eos> Force of habit, interrogating murderers.<eos> You know what they say.<eos> The best defense is a good offense.<eos> Only there is no defense for what I could do to you.
Plainclothes officers in pursuit of an offender.<eos> Male, black.<eos> Stop!<eos> - Chicago PD!<eos> - You all right, sir? You all right?
Well, when I heard the, DEA was joining the investigation into Teo's suicide...<eos> Cause of death is yet to be determined.<eos> Well, I don't mean to speak ill of the dead, but Teo was screwing the help.<eos> Jailbait, no less.<eos> Tell you that himself?
Really, Henry?<eos> Black Fairy?<eos> Curse?<eos> Henry, I-I-I thought we were past all this.<eos> She's done something to you, to... to everyone.
How did you get in here?<eos> You can't be here.<eos> Dr. Krilov, I'm a friend of a friend.<eos> I'd like to discuss a proposal with you.<eos> - May I buy you lunch? - ♪ oh, no ♪
Had to talk a couple of college girls from dancing on the tables, but other than that,<eos> - it's been pretty quiet.<eos> - What the hell, dude?<eos> - No, man.<eos> You're done.
Your heart is working way too hard to compensate for your bad valve.<eos> First time I've ever heard of hard work being a bad thing.<eos> - You got a fix?<eos> - We will.<eos> We're gonna get you an angiogram, and it'll give us a full picture of your heart, and then we're gonna figure out a plan.
- Just try to stay calm,<eos> - Mr. Foster.<eos> - Okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> We're gonna help you.
He's dead, huh?<eos> Fred specialized in cheating spouses, the kind who leave stains in cheap motel rooms.<eos> I imagine, occasionally, he needed you to run a DNA sample for him.<eos> When I went through Fred's financials yesterday, I noticed he wrote quite a few checks to you over the years.<eos> Just you.
Good work.<eos> What happened?<eos> It was a close call, but we're safe.<eos> Chairman Park put in a good word for you.<eos> He acquired this golf course thanks to you.
A good lawyer has less friends than a terrorist.<eos> So if you need a friend, raise a dog instead.<eos> That's today's lesson.<eos> Mr. Lee?<eos> May I offer you a job?
- You had no right to stop me.<eos> - Why is there an Interpol Orange Notice indicating you are a threat to national security?<eos> Patricia Gregson.<eos> Heinrichs, Federal Police.<eos> Does the name Golden Crescent mean anything to you?
So you going to transfer him?<eos> No.<eos> I was suggesting that you might want to consider a transfer.<eos> If it helps, I'd be more than happy to fast-track it for you.<eos> I'll save you the trouble.
So you know how important it is that I see the process. That way you get the credit you deserve.<eos> You are full of shit.<eos> I am full of shit. No one says it to my face, though.<eos> This is a restricted area.<eos> You can't come in.
Yeah, look I...<eos> He never... said any of that to me.<eos> I mean, we... I called him and we spoke about it, he said yes.<eos> Right, well that's the first lie.<eos> And I'm sure Mr Stirling's informed you of the punishments we may enforce if witnesses perjure themselves before the Commission.
- I beg your pardon?<eos> - I said get out, before I find you in contempt.<eos> Can you see the pattern here, Clay?<eos> If not, I'll spell it out.<eos> Someone's giving you the valuable tips on where the smart money is, and it can only be someone on your team.
I don't recall the occasion.<eos> Let me help you.<eos> The young man who bowled the wide has since suicided.<eos> That has got nothing to do with me.<eos> But it has got something to do with the people who gave you the tip.
So I end up dead, like Oliver Pittman, or run off the road like Eddie Cooke?<eos> Nate, we know three or four other minor players, just like you, but we can only protect the first person who talks to us.<eos> Do you understand that?<eos> Yep.<eos> So, who told you what to bet on?
Were you aware of the huge bets that were being placed on the Devils performing well last season?<eos> - I'm not a gambler, I'm a scientist.<eos> - Answer the question, Mr Cooke.<eos> Yes.<eos> - How? Who told you?
A man gave it to me.<eos> Eddie Cooke?<eos> You know about him too?<eos> Dear God.<eos> Did Eddie Cooke give you this phone?
That man, you see... he gave me a choice.<eos> He said if I was to make any trouble, I would have to choose between killing myself, or him... killing my granddaughter.<eos> So, the only real question you've gotta ask yourself is this.<eos> Who do you love more, yourself or your son?<eos> Was that the man who told you to import the precursors?
It's on his right hip.<eos> Hands behind your back.<eos> You're a bit of a dark horse, aren't you, Mr Wesley John Foster?<eos> On your feet.<eos> Who ordered you to set fire to Wazim Jandaphur's house?
And what did you do after that?<eos> Went to a mate's barbecue.<eos> Well, he needed gas.<eos> I certainly didn't burn down any houses.<eos> This isn't helping you, Mr Foster.
Well, he needed gas.<eos> I certainly didn't burn down any houses.<eos> This isn't helping you, Mr Foster.<eos> The only way you'll help yourself is to cooperate, otherwise I will keep you locked up, indefinitely.<eos> Who ordered you to threaten Clay Nelson's child?
You two looked so good together.<eos> Why didn't you ask first?<eos> I should've asked, sorry.<eos> Give me your number.<eos> I'll send you the pictures.
It's a black Azera, 51GA 3458.<eos> Sir, we can't disclose private information.<eos> Then you motherfuckers should've said it before drinking that!<eos> Spit it out, you son of a bitch!<eos> What's with you, sir?
That technology takes years to develop, and your entire division's only been in existence<eos> - since last Tuesday.<eos> - What can I say?<eos> When you invest in the right talent, you can move mountains, and last I checked, being smarter than your competition wasn't illegal.<eos> - Well, if you're half as smart as you say you are, you'd give us our product back now, or we'll take your company from you later.
- Guard!<eos> - Listen, you don't have to talk to us.<eos> But this thing comes out, instead of getting out in five years, you're gonna spend the rest of your life in here.<eos> - All right, what do you wanna know?<eos> - Let's start with who's telling you to pick fights with guys who are about to get out.
You're going to hell!<eos> You're killing people!<eos> Sir.<eos> Paul, wheelchair.<eos> Hey, let us help you.
Okay, well, let's get that wound looked at, huh?<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> Sir, do you know who's responsible?<eos> - Senator, how are you feeling?<eos> - Senator Arnold, are you okay?
Same.<eos> You said that was gonna help.<eos> What the hell kind of hospital is this?<eos> - Is this how you treat your vets?<eos> - We give all of our vets five-star treatment just like we're giving you.
The most important oneofakind device in human history, and no one at Tanz Industries even thought to properly vet the man building it?<eos> Rehashing the past and pointing fingers does little to stop that asteroid.<eos> We need to focus on potential solutions, and quickly.<eos> Solutions? Forgive me, but from where I'm sitting, Mr. Tanz, you've given us nothing but problems.<eos> We gave you $1 billion, and what do we have to show for it?
It became a million-seller on its fourth day.<eos> That's incredible.<eos> My books could never do that.<eos> No, that's not true.<eos> Like I just said, all you need the right chance.
I'll do my best.<eos> Good night.<eos> Good night.<eos> Mr. Michima, I express my sympathies regarding your father.<eos> Can I ask you a few questions?
Mike, open the door!<eos> Michael Milch, set down the knife immediately, or we will detonate the explosive.<eos> Mike!<eos> Mike, please!<eos> Mr. Milch, we will give you 10 seconds to cease and desist.
For a moment, you entered the astral dimension.<eos> The what?<eos> A place where the soul exists apart from the body.<eos> Why are you doing this to me?<eos> To show you just how much you don't know.
Well, I guess the graciousness has run out.<eos> You want to see it?<eos> I would love to see it.<eos> Well, he can't see it.<eos> I'm going to show it to you, then.
And you, and you.<eos> So, I need a face-to-face with the man who runs Southern Air Transport so I can clean up this mess.<eos> Mr. Bob, I think we should walk before we run.<eos> Everything will happen in the right time.<eos> Mr. Mora, are you okay?
I apologize for my associate's indiscretion, but as your friend, I beg you to get him his money. Without it, he is an animal.<eos> And I'm asking you to tell Don Chepe to deliver a message to Escobar that I do not do business under threat.<eos> Well, at this point, unfortunately, neither you nor I are in a position to dictate terms to Don Pablo.<eos> Ah! Mr. Awan.<eos> Thank you very much for having me to your home.
Miss Bennet, although I know many consider you to be decidedly inferior, as a matter of your birth, your family, and your circumstances, my feelings will not be repressed.<eos> In vain have I struggled.<eos> I have come to feel for you a most ardent admiration and regard, which has overcome my better judgment.<eos> So now I ask you most fervently to end my turmoil and consent to be my wife.<eos> If I could feel gratitude, i would now thank you, but I cannot.
Get off me! Get off me! Harley, what do you mean by that?<eos> Harley!<eos> Hey, I got a delivery. I have a gift basket for Dr.Van Criss.<eos> You're not on the access list. I can't let you in. Sorry.<eos> Cool if I leave it with you?
You're looking very alive.<eos> Only on the outside.<eos> -This is not going to end well for me, is it? -This is not gonna end well for you, no.<eos> Where's your boss?<eos> I can tell you exactly...
Corner Office and Bookshelf. Got it.<eos> I made a video in here once.<eos> And I'm not the only one.<eos> Okay, thank you. Thank you.<eos> Oh, Mr. Wilheimer, I wanted to thank you for this opportunity.
Actually, through the use of GPS triangulation, my app, the iSearchU, allowed me to send you a text message and receive back your exact location, right down to this stall.<eos> It's incredible!<eos> You know Foursquare does that already, right?<eos> No, no, no. You don't get it.<eos> Foursquare lets you tell other people where you are.
No, no, no. You don't get it.<eos> Foursquare lets you tell other people where you are.<eos> My app tells me where you are even if you don't want me to know.<eos> It's a game changer, sir, okay?<eos> I'm telling you, if you say yes right now, I can promise you 50-50 in my company.
-Look, just calm down.<eos> I'm sorry the process is so troubling, but because it's been delayed for 15 years, it's actually not surprising that your puberty experience is happening at a highly accelerated speed.<eos> -It's actually quite fascinating. -Oh, it's fascinating?<eos> Good.<eos> I'm glad my misery can be an upper for you, doc. -I didn't mean it that way.
- The Nancy Starling. - After their mother.<eos> - The nail on the head.<eos> On the head.<eos> Authenticity, optimism, and a dog.<eos> I imagine call-up's left quite a hole in your ranks, so, in the interest of a quick turnaround, we'll let you have some of our people.
"They're calling you a genius again, God help you.<eos> "Come home soon. Max."<eos> What can I do for you?<eos> It's rather what can I do for you, Mr. Perkins.<eos> I couldn't help noticing Tom dedicated his new book to you.
What are you going to do?<eos> What do you suggest?<eos> Nine counts would be a lot of jail time.<eos> You can add. Congratulations.<eos> I don't pay you to say the obvious.
I'm not afraid of the Spanish police.<eos> It's not just the police.<eos> Nobody.<eos> Okay.<eos> We need to make you a passport just in case.
Nobody.<eos> Okay.<eos> We need to make you a passport just in case.<eos> Have you got a photo we can use?<eos> Do you mind the music?
The geological reports on this are highly encouraging.<eos> We are taking a very aggressive approach.<eos> Prospectus?<eos> Of course.<eos> I can have my secretary send you one right out.
Mr. Williams, please rise.<eos> Please raise your right hand, Sir.<eos> Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> - Yes, Sir.<eos> - Thank you, Sir, please be seated.
Young man, pardon me, can you please tell me where I can find Mr. Mike Williams?<eos> Yes, Sir, he's in the ET shops on the second deck by the coffee shop.<eos> - Thank you much.<eos> - Have a wonderful day, Sir.<eos> And you, Sir.
Okay, then let's go.<eos> Okay, get me to the bridge, Mike.<eos> Coast Guard, District 8 Command Center, Lieutenant Degan speaking.<eos> Hi, Sir.<eos> I just... um... I don't mean to bother you, I'm sure everything's just fine.
Sorry, I'm late.<eos> Hey. No problem.<eos> Are you the manager?<eos> Depends who's asking.<eos> My friend says she owes you some money.
How long before this equipment's operational?<eos> A few hours.<eos> - Is it gonna work?<eos> - If we get close enough.<eos> Let me tell you something.
Are you all right?<eos> No, that's not mine.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Thank you for asking though, ma'am.<eos> What do you need?
I'm sorry, when you say we, whom do you mean?<eos> Us all.<eos> I will not leave without my step-children, the reader and the cook.<eos> Thank you, ma'am.<eos> Thank you, sir, you're very kind.
Hear, hear. Well said, Mr. Sherbourne.<eos> Well said. Here's to the future.<eos> - To the future.<eos> - To the future.<eos> We wish you all the best. All the best.
Won't you stay for lunch?<eos> That'd be very nice.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You must have really impressed the Commonwealth.<eos> Offering you the post after only three months.
Now, I ain't got to say nothing.<eos> First words come out of his mouth,<eos> "I understand you need some furniture and can't get no credit."<eos> I liked to fell over.<eos> He said, "I'll give you all the credit you want,"
What do you usually do?<eos> I don't do anything, Miss Clark.<eos> I sit.<eos> I just about exist.<eos> Okay. Well, I could get you your computer.
- Negative, are you sure?<eos> Yes.<eos> Negative. Please don't worry.<eos> You're perfectly fine.<eos> No, thank you.
All right. You gonna do it?<eos> All right.<eos> - Michael Regan, you are under arrest for burglary and aggravated assault.<eos> You have the right to remain silent.<eos> Anything you say may be used against you. You have the right to have any attorney present when being questioned.
All right.<eos> - Michael Regan, you are under arrest for burglary and aggravated assault.<eos> You have the right to remain silent.<eos> Anything you say may be used against you. You have the right to have any attorney present when being questioned.<eos> If you can't afford an attorney, one will be appointed to you by the court of law of the city of Baltimore.
This is it.<eos> I appreciate your cooperation.<eos> I'm back.<eos> And I've brought someone with me.<eos> Mr. Kimmel, I'd like you to meet Mr. Stackhouse.
No.<eos> What did you say, fox?<eos> Sorry.<eos> What I said was, "no."<eos> She will not be giving you that badge.
No.<eos> Listen, we still don't know why this is happening.<eos> It could destroy Zootopia.<eos> You have the right to remain silent.<eos> Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
- Great, I'm okay.<eos> I like those shoes.<eos> I can't stay down here, Alfred.<eos> Go upstairs and socialize.<eos> Some young lady from Metropolis will make you honest.
You should, not pick a fight with this person.<eos> So, after all these years, we've finally got you over to Metropolis.<eos> - Well, I thought I come drink you dry.<eos> - Well, you're welcome.<eos> You should hop the hub more often though, I love to show you my labs.
The cab driver.<eos> I tried to call before, yeah.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, you know.<eos> Listen, I... I know it might be too soon, but I was wondering if maybe we could meet up?<eos> I won't take up much of your time, and I totally understand if it's not something you want to do.
I won't take up much of your time, and I totally understand if it's not something you want to do.<eos> What, today?<eos> Yeah, are you sure?<eos> All right, great.<eos> All right, Simon, thank you.
Tell me one thing.<eos> Was she smiling?<eos> What?<eos> Ruth, when it happened, was she smiling?<eos> Sorry, I don't understand what you mean.
Now, please.<eos> But eternity anywhere sounds like hell.<eos> KB.<eos> Mr Wilson can be accessed via the service elevator in the basement.<eos> That gentleman at the velvet rope can show you the way.
You have 48 hours to make this work.<eos> National security threat, highest level.<eos> Can you or can you not transfer memories from a dead mammal to a live one?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What do you need?
You are truly an artist.<eos> The colours are most impressive.<eos> Maria.<eos> You want to look at the carvings?<eos> - Good day to you, sir.
Paleolithic. Paleolithic.<eos> Professor Vilanova, Monsieur Paul Ratier.<eos> - How do you do, sir?<eos> - A great artist.<eos> Perhaps you can persuade my wife to come and see the real thing.
Are you still in possession?<eos> Mr. Langdon, do you have the tube?<eos> Mes.<eos> - Where are you located?<eos> Professor, we can't help you if we can't find you.
And what was in it?<eos> The Faraday pointer with the Map of Hell.<eos> A puzzle.<eos> Specifically designed for his follower to solve.<eos> We brought it to you.
To shield Bertrand Zobrist and his research? To hide him, to protect him?<eos> Regrettably, yes.<eos> And that all of my attempts to prevent him from initiating a worldwide pandemic have failed because of you?<eos> Incisive sum-up, yes.<eos> Now you have the temerity to ask that I simply decide to trust you?
You're not alone.<eos> So a beautiful young woman went for the bad guy.<eos> That happens.<eos> You look disappointed.<eos> I'll give you a minute.
I'm not supposed to go near the Second Salemers.<eos> What was that?<eos> Uh, moth, I think.<eos> Hey! Quiet down! I'm trying to get a statement.<eos> I'm telling you, it's a gas explosion again.
You fool nobody, Mr. Scamander.<eos> You brought this Obscurus into the City of New York in the hope of causing mass disruption, breaking the Statute of Secrecy and revealing the magical world.<eos> You know that can't hurt anyone.<eos> You know that. You are therefore guilty of a treasonous betrayal of your fellow wizards and are sentenced to death.<eos> Miss Goldstein, who has aided and abetted you...
News travels fast.<eos> I was hoping you'd be able to tell me if there've been any sightings.<eos> Tracks, that sort of thing.<eos> You got a pretty big price on your head, Mr. Scamander.<eos> Why should I help you instead of turning you in?
There's no need to be afraid.<eos> I'm here with your brother, Credence.<eos> Out you come now.<eos> Credence. I owe you an apology.<eos> I trusted you.
It was the lights and the camera that she brought with her.<eos> Okay.<eos> All done.<eos> That was from my mom.<eos> Her name is Brenda, she says to say "thank you" and that she's single.
It's the only clothing that I have.<eos> Dry-cleaning?<eos> If it's too much... If it's too late...<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> Captain Sullenberger, I'd give you this whole hotel if I could.
- Mrs. Smit?<eos> Get out, Banu.<eos> I'm so sorry. Sorry.<eos> Now, let me show you how wild this animal can be.<eos> Did you really think I'd let you sleep with my wife, Mr. Graves?
So, I need your help.<eos> You said the dolls, they're poisoned?<eos> I had the feeling you'd be more comfortable with that... than if I said they're cursed.<eos> Oh, Detective, you came to me.<eos> And I can help you, but only if you really hear me.
- Indeed. - Sir.<eos> We are told you can provide us with some information, Sir Alistair.<eos> Well, if I can, then I most certainly will.<eos> Who exactly has asked you to interfere with my wish to marry?<eos> I will tell you... exactly.
We pay the taxes they demand, and we get nothing.<eos> Mr Nash.<eos> What is keeping you here so long?<eos> It's a beautiful country.<eos> I should be flattered, but I don't believe you.
Tell your people to remove themselves from this gate immediately.<eos> Unfortunately, in the absence of your decision on my appointment as the king,<eos> I don't have any power over them.<eos> Mrs Khama, I strongly urge you to reconsider and come with us.<eos> My husband has told you. He's...
They have reviewed it and considered the conflict between you and your uncle.<eos> And after taking all things into account, we have concluded that you should be exiled from Bechuanaland for a period of five years.<eos> Call it a period of reflection.<eos> After five years, we will, of course, review the situation.<eos> But in the meantime, we are able to offer you a position in the administration of Jamaica.
I appreciate that.<eos> He's decided that five years' banishment will cause unrest and uncertainty in the protectorate, and he wishes to bring an end to such insecurity.<eos> Consequently, he will be announcing that your banishment is for life.<eos> I beg your pardon?<eos> Yes, on the occasion of our previous meeting I was able to offer you a career in the administration of Jamaica.
I believe that two days ago, Mr Khama, you had a meeting with your uncle, authorised by Mr Roberts in the Commonwealth Office.<eos> Mr Roberts will not be available in the future to make such decisions.<eos> I also know you want to discuss the outcome of that meeting with me for relay to the British Government.<eos> Before you begin, let me be clear.<eos> There can and will be no circumstance in which we will allow you to return to Bechuanaland permanently.
She's not dead.<eos> - Do you have family? - I have children...<eos> Okay.<eos> If this was your child, if you knew she was lost and in pain... you'd do anything to help, wouldn't you?<eos> I can't prove to you that I'm right.
Did anyone see you at home?<eos> I just told you I was alone<eos> Aryan, I'll call our lawyer.<eos> Can you talk in a language we all can understand?<eos> Let me translate it in a language you understand.
That was really sweet, what you did for the young people.<eos> Oh, they deserve it.<eos> 'Cos it helps to ease my conscious.<eos> They say, there's a correlation between generosity and guilt.<eos> But, you got the money.
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.<eos> Oh, well, hello.<eos> This is my wife, Ruth. Hello.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> Our secretary, Mr. Walter White, has asked me to deliver this to you personally
There's only fast and slow.<eos> For those 10 seconds, you are completely free.<eos> Now, here you come telling me I can't do it, that I'm letting down my race if I go.<eos> God gave you a great gift, Mr. Owens.<eos> Maybe he can tell you what to do with it.
Black people?<eos> Yeah, well, you're white!<eos> Come on.<eos> It's okay.<eos> What happened to you?
Shall we?<eos> So each apartment has over 300 square meters of premium living space.<eos> But this one gets the Sydney sunset.<eos> The specifications are all in the brochure.<eos> Let me show you the detailed floor plan.
- Thank you.<eos> As I said, we could have done this over the phone.<eos> I'm just looking for a statement on sharia in Kandahar.<eos> I understand that you are no longer with your special friend Chris.<eos> Who told you that?
Mr. Cash?<eos> She's got a decent concussion, but we did a cat scan and there's absolutely no damage to the brain.<eos> She does have a slight fracture across the tibia and fibula of her left leg.<eos> She's going to need a neck brace and a cast, but otherwise she's fine.<eos> Can I show you something?
I've got a minor here.<eos> Excuse me, sir.<eos> Sir! Sir.<eos> - Me?<eos> - Can I take a picture of you and your cat?
No, there must be a mistake.<eos> Brenda went to the movies.<eos> She was nowhere near the 118.<eos> Obviously you're in shock.<eos> I'm gonna pass you off to a grief councilor... who can help you onto the next step.
President.<eos> -How you doing?<eos> -I'm doing great.<eos> I like that sharp suit.<eos> -Hey, I'll get you one.
- No.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Yeah, I got it.<eos> I'll dispatch it in the morning.<eos> Don't think I'm going to let you sleep, Mr. Vatan.
He's out of my line of sight, Jane.<eos> Relax.<eos> I know this is hard, but I need you to stay calm as ice.<eos> Approaching on your right.<eos> She remind you of someone you know?
Just one thing.<eos> You see what happens when you fuck with me?<eos> - Where's Emily?<eos> - Who? Where is she?<eos> I don't know what you're saying!
We act as normal as possible, okay?<eos> I go to work. Until I can figure something out, we'll just leave her there.<eos> Do you want some coffee?<eos> Yeah. That'd be nice.<eos> She remind you of someone you know?
We need help!<eos> You're gonna be okay, baby.<eos> I'm gonna come back to get you. Don't leave me, Ben.<eos> Ben.<eos> Sir, are you all right?
And you've got no way of contacting him?<eos> You haven't got a phone number, or...?<eos> He had mine.<eos> Right, look, I don't have his number. I don't know where he lived.<eos> I don't even know his last name, but I am telling you... he never got off that ferry.
Michael, this is Detective Inspector Perez.<eos> He's been asking about your rings.<eos> Yeah, we're looking for someone who was involved in some minor altercation on the ferry the night before last...<eos> - somebody that fits your description.<eos> - I just want to ask you a few questions.
This man's crazy, he can do anything.<eos> We need to act fast.<eos> Ma'am, I promise you, my best men will be on the job.<eos> I have a request.<eos> I want to send an officer from India.. ..who will help you on this case.
- You seem surprised.<eos> Better like this? Ah.<eos> Michèle, some other time, I have to take off.<eos> No, not yet.<eos> My mother told you she's HIV-positive?
My friend Ashley said he know a guy that can control his body temperature by holding his breath.<eos> Is that possible?<eos> Well, I haven't researched that, Mr. Pittman, but I'll look into that, okay?<eos> Let's see... breath...<eos> I'll let you know.
Who says we're a highly-perfectionist family?<eos> We're an ordinary family.<eos> What about the physiological basis for her stuttering?<eos> I read an article where...<eos> I can give you organic theories if that's what you want, but that's not the way I've found I can be most effective.
You hunt, Ed?<eos> Did some skeet shooting with my dad a few times, but, no, I never went hunting.<eos> We'll go one day.<eos> That'd be great.<eos> Mr. O'Brian, can I ask you a question?
Okay, but just to clarify, I did not hack it, I showed that it could be hacked.<eos> You told me to find a patch.<eos> You have that in writing?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> Remember, I sent you the proof of concept.
Okay, okay.<eos> We got it.<eos> Thank you for the presentation.<eos> You can go ahead.<eos> Thank you, sir.
You're Catholic.<eos> I have no religion. I have nothing, ma'am.<eos> Nothing to call my own.<eos> I know. But you have a profession.<eos> We could help set you up in business.
My letters.<eos> Let me go!<eos> This is the last time I'll write.<eos> I'm expecting your child.<eos> I didn't want to tell you. So you wouldn't think I was trying to influence your attitude toward me.
Have a good day.<eos> Damn!<eos> What happened?<eos> I see you've already made yourself at home in the new office, Mr. Guskov.<eos> We wanted to ask you several questions.
I don't know any Lizas!<eos> She was killed the same night as Alyona.<eos> The killer dropped this token at the crime scene.<eos> Okay.<eos> I... I'll tell you everything.
Tanya was sterile.<eos> He's making it all up, just making up!<eos> You showed me your daughter Polina yourself.<eos> She was in the wheelchair.<eos> Sorry, where did I show you my daughter?
- No need to worry on that score, Watson.<eos> - No? There's only a large cavity where that organ should reside.<eos> - It's a family trait.<eos> - Oh, I wasn't being critical.<eos> If you continue like this, sir, I give you five years at the most.
Yeah, but they won't be by until morning.<eos> I thought I'd get a head start.<eos> Not bad. I should have you added to my staff.<eos> I'll put in a request to Admiral Gardner for a transfer.<eos> Hey, can I ask you a question as a friend?
Did you know Wayne Peters?<eos> - No.<eos> - Here's a picture of him.<eos> Ever seen him before?<eos> - No. I guess I can't help you, sergeant.
Bureau Chief Vincent.<eos> Organized Crime.<eos> I have jurisdictional authority.<eos> You forfeited jurisdiction.<eos> And you proved to be an authority on nothing when you lost three convicted felons in one night!
Am I right, that's inadmissible?<eos> That's "heresy," right?<eos> Something like that.<eos> Disregard Ms. Kapoor's last statement.<eos> This is an order of protection issued against you by your wife, Michelle.
Oh, no, hey, I need this like a fucking hole in the head!<eos> Fuck!<eos> You under any unusual stress?<eos> You could say that.<eos> Who gave you this?
You learned something in there.<eos> Everyone's got a cross to bear, Naz.<eos> Pardon the expression, fuck 'em all.<eos> Live your life.<eos> Thank you for what you did for me.
Security?<eos> That's a first.<eos> Not everybody needs a gun to get things done.<eos> What else can I do for you today, special agent?<eos> I'm asking you simple questions, just answer them.
Previously on The Expanse...<eos> Show me incident reports for the docks for Juliette Andromeda Mao.<eos> Hold it right there.<eos> How much are they paying you to find her?
I take my job... Very seriously.<eos> You are the station joke,<eos> I did my homework.<eos> Maybe, but Star Helix knows I'm onto you, so...<eos> You wanna be careful how far you wanna take this.
She came to me. Asked me to help her.<eos> She knew what she was doing.<eos> She was willing to make a sacrifice for us.<eos> It's more than you.<eos> She trusted you, she put herself in your hands 'cause she couldn't see the blood on 'em.
And living with this pain, I came to realize that I have millions of brothers and sisters in the Belt.<eos> I even count you among them.<eos> As I did Julie, an Earther.<eos> So, everybody dies for the cause, except for you.<eos> Now I'll tell you the truth about Julie.
You people drive a hard bargain.<eos> You got our recorded statements.<eos> We'll bring your Lionel Polanski home, if he's out there.<eos> In return, I want you to help me find someone.<eos> Someday, I'll come to you with a name. No questions asked.
I think I may have found another one in you.<eos> You think you've won?<eos> Not yet.<eos> But we are getting closer, huh?<eos> I was never fighting against you, Miller.
Uh. Forgive me for saying so, but I don't get the impression you're a man who's accepted Jesus Christ into his heart.<eos> I guess I'm just not that desperate.<eos> We all are.<eos> If we're being honest with ourselves.<eos> Let me ask you something.
We don't give out that info.<eos> I'm just trying to find her, you know.<eos> I mean, if she's here.<eos> She's gonna be in some trouble.<eos> Hey, how about I sponsor you a round.
Unless you want incredible things to happen.<eos> She's got more than enough in her.<eos> Tell the crew to prepare the injections.<eos> Give us a moment.<eos> I'm truly sorry to be the one to have to tell you this, but your daughter is dead.
I thought that since you had a certain... friendship with her, that you might have some insight that would help us.<eos> I don't think I do.<eos> Did you know that Peter Drax isn't Louis' biological father?<eos> I did.<eos> So if she told you that, she probably also told you that she put Louis up for adoption when he was just a baby.
eccentric, perhaps, but not a suspect.<eos> Then why does this feel like an interrogation?<eos> Peter Drax's body was found in a cave 500 yards from where Louis was rescued.<eos> So?<eos> That doesn't seem like a coincidence to you?
That the two bodies were found in the same place?<eos> Did Louis ever express any anger toward Natalie?<eos> Did you never suspect that she might be involved in the accident?<eos> What are you getting at?<eos> Don't you think it's strange that Louis would have me write that prescription?
Yes, good to see you again.<eos> Oh, the eggs!<eos> You know these are the professional.<eos> We didn't really paint them. It's very complicated.<eos> But we did it with the children. We can show you, if you want.
We're talking to him. Do you know him?<eos> Naz?<eos> No. Did she know him?<eos> She may have just met him.<eos> I'd like to show you some pictures.
Yes. Help!<eos> Go on, Cedric!<eos> Thank you!<eos> Another successful operation.<eos> Are you out of your tiny, wee mind?
- Sorry for your loss.<eos> - Did you know my uncle?<eos> No, not personally.<eos> No. No, he was more of a shut-in.<eos> Were you close?
No. No, he was more of a shut-in.<eos> Were you close?<eos> I didn't know anything about him until a couple days ago.<eos> Well, that's weird.<eos> He just he just gave you this property just like that? That's very weird.
There's always hope.<eos> Thank you.<eos> And how much is the retainer, exactly? $2,500.<eos> And then we'll see where it goes from there.<eos> Well, I can have that to you first thing tomorrow, if that's all right.
- A week.<eos> I'm not destitute.<eos> A few pointers as to how Madam Florence does things.<eos> You will note that she carries a leather briefcase with her at all times.<eos> You are not to touch that briefcase or to enquire as to its contents.
Good, good.<eos> Madam Florence is inordinately fond of sandwiches.<eos> And potato salad as well.<eos> When we throw parties, we make mountains of the stuff.<eos> It would serve you to consume both with enthusiasm.
Oh, my hat!<eos> "Only the night before at Carnegie Hall,<eos> Sinatra entertained 3,000 of his bobbysox followers."<eos> The piece was spiteful, vicious and wholly inaccurate and it has caused a great deal of upset.<eos> Do I need to remind you that Madam Florence is a very close personal friend of Arturo Toscanini's?
Of course.<eos> I'm back! Oh!<eos> You must be Mrs Smith's husband.<eos> Yes... I am.<eos> We're here at assess your wife, with a view to providing home help for her and for you.
I'm shocked that a king's officer would behave in such an unchristian manner.<eos> Ma'am, I thought he meant to do you harm.<eos> Are you all right, sir?<eos> I apologize for the lieutenant's beastly behavior.<eos> Here, let me help you up.
That's what I'm telling you.<eos> And as a proud NYPD detective... see, my partner and I, well... we're accountable for each other.<eos> We need to know each other's whereabouts, 24/7.<eos> And thanks to my partner's GPS on her phone, I got Mr. Cage's home address.<eos> And I will give it to you... if you're a good boy.
Hi.<eos> Sorry to ring so late.<eos> My name is Sandra Lopez.<eos> I'm currently majoring in prison studies at Boston University, and, uh,<eos> I was just wondering if I could ask you a few questions about your time at Seagate.
Can you unlock it?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> It's all here.<eos> Everything.<eos> Everything you need?
- No.<eos> Then it's Mariah Dillard.<eos> Did you put her in touch with someone?<eos> It's Boone again.<eos> Mr. Boone. Are you okay?
I remember.<eos> I remember everything.<eos> Captain Webb.<eos> Good morning<eos> Has everything been explalined to you?
These are my people.<eos> I know how to deal with them.<eos> And what do you want?<eos> When you appoint a new Agency Director You're going to need someone working for your interests.<eos> Someone... enpowered... by you.
I'm about to head out to the market.<eos> Um... We shop at Gordon's.<eos> Is that all right?<eos> Oh, yeah, that's fine.<eos> Yeah, yeah. You know, Mr. Church, if we're going to do this... let me at least give you some money.
Can I get you something to eat?<eos> No.<eos> You want some water?<eos> No.<eos> Okay, well, I'll give you your privacy.
Better for you, or better for us, Mr. Huntington?<eos> Say your piece.<eos> Very well, Mr. Strobridge, the Central Pacific no longer requires your services as railroad superintendent.<eos> You have until tomorrow to pack your things.<eos> The railroad will provide transit for you and your family wherever you want to go.
Mr. Huntington, if you want Ogden, you will make it your business to be there first.<eos> I might think your time better spent swinging a hammer than trying to hoodwink me with a glass of water.<eos> Look, you give me Ogden, and I will reroute the five southern railroad lines I own from Promontory to Cheyenne.<eos> Your majestic city will sit as the most important railroad junction in the country.<eos> Can Thomas Durant give you that?
Here you are.<eos> - I can buy my own whiskey, Mr. Bohannon.<eos> - No.<eos> When I come through Cheyenne, with a wife and baby and no way to provide weren't necessary for you to hire me neither.<eos> Gave you a job slinging rock.
You do the same."<eos> His last words?<eos> Confirm the contents?<eos> No need.<eos> I trust you.
Well, you're a... doctor.<eos> You should know that sunshine is good for you.<eos> And, you know, it's... not like I see you every Tuesday at 10:00, so... 12 meetings in 5 years is enough to constitute a professional relationship.<eos> Next time in my office.<eos> Fine, but I'm not bringing you coffee.
- Good, thank you.<eos> How many times do I have to ask for the garage door to be closed properly?<eos> - Please remind your wife...<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> Let me show you.
That's not an answer.<eos> Guys, lock him to a time frame.<eos> Pin him to a version of the story he can't change later.<eos> And what about your left hand there?<eos> How did you get that injury?
No.<eos> You're saying that you've never used the "N" word?<eos> What's this got to do with the case?<eos> Detective, have you used the word?<eos> Has anyone told you that I've used the word?
But surely it's just a stomachache?<eos> It's best to be on the safe side, ma chérie.<eos> When did this come?<eos> - Just now, Your Excellency. - Thank you.<eos> "Perhaps you should get some new spectacles, Count Bezukhov, "then you might see what everyone sees but you.
Mary, I...<eos> Can you forgive me?<eos> For all the things...<eos> She says yes.<eos> She forgives you.
Mr Shelby, if I want to play the squire in your place of false charity then I will.<eos> Ambition for respectability doesn't make you a saint. Am I wrong?<eos> Oh, Lord.<eos> That's six, is it?<eos> Well, I will wish you a good day.
Like us, Mr Shelby.<eos> Let's talk about trust, then, shall we?<eos> You are not a direct relation to the Romanovs.<eos> You are Georgian.<eos> And the palace where you live in Hampton Court is in fact a grace-and-favour house donated to you rent-free by the British Crown.
I can help you... take him down.<eos> I know everything about Jim Gordon.<eos> If you let me out of here, we could probably just sit down in your office...<eos> Mr. Nygma, you can't help me.<eos> I'm here to help you.
Trust me.<eos> How can I trust you when you're talkin' crazy?<eos> How can I trust you when you've lied to me so many times?<eos> Monsters?<eos> ! I lied to you because it's hard to tell you the truth.
Just like Pinewood, right?<eos> Seeing as how you no longer work for the police department, I'm not required to speak with you,<eos> Mr. Gordon.<eos> You have a lot of anger, James Gordon.<eos> I can help you with that.
Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.<eos> No doubt.<eos> Due the highly contagious nature of the virus, you will both be quarantined to your houses for the next nine days.<eos> Oh, nine days in isolation.<eos> Sir, I'd be happy to keep you company.
Every time we check one off the list, you're gonna hear this bell.<eos> It's the sound of victory.<eos> Hmm, you should add "fix bell" to that list.<eos> - Morning, Captain. - Peralta.<eos> I'd like to introduce you to someone.
Thank you anyway, but I can cook for myself.<eos> Wow, I would roll my eyes so hard right now if it didn't make my brain burn.<eos> Okay, Captain, this ends now.<eos> I know your pride is hurt, but no one ever took pity on you.<eos> All we wanted to do was help you when you were down because that's what people do when they care about each other.
Unbelievable.<eos> I love angula.<eos> I mean, it's impossible to find here.<eos> Oh, not if you have a ton of disposable income and great credit, like I do.<eos> I think you're gonna love these.
- Absolutely.<eos> Oh, thank you. - Excuse me.<eos> - Thank you. I can't believe you're still alive.<eos> Your blood work is amazing.<eos> Thank you so... Well, it's because of you.
You are perfect. You are an angel, and I'll see you when I get back from Pakistan.<eos> Sir, we have been through this. I do not care about George Washington. You cannot go to Pakistan without an entry visa.<eos> This is bureaucratic morass is what this is.<eos> Yes, my Lord.<eos> And God just... gave you a sign.
Mr. Khallaf Bin Zayed.<eos> Iraqi Republican Army.<eos> At your service.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> I'll give you plenty of opportunities to express your gratitude.
But what can they do?<eos> Baghdad sent us but forgot our supplies.<eos> They thought we could depend on your hospitality.<eos> But... why are you so worried?<eos> It's not like they really did anything to you.
We can't issue them passports, can we?<eos> I get it.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Sorry, Mr. Katiyal.<eos> All I can offer you is this Kleicha.
What? Ranjit?<eos> You simply took his word for it?<eos> You must do things properly.<eos> Paperwork is highly important.<eos> I don't know how you handled such a huge company.
But now we're talking to Jordan to let the Indians in Amman.<eos> Amman?<eos> Amman is 1000 kilometers from here.<eos> And we'll have to go through Iraq.<eos> Kohli sir, you can say it so easily.
I ironed my own shirt this morning.<eos> Nice gun, sir. Cross draw.<eos> Sig Sauer 226?<eos> You know your guns.<eos> Thank you, sir.
Ah, now, Count. There you are, too modest.<eos> The very fact that your father singled you out for greatness shows that you must have exceptional qualities, which I discovered for myself long since.<eos> Really?<eos> I had no idea.<eos> And Prince Vassily is advising you?
Or find a new place to keep your daughter's horse.<eos> Cool, cool.<eos> Okay, that... that's definitely good to know.<eos> I'll, uh... I'm gonna get on that. Uh... but I do have a little bit of time to get... to get the money to you?<eos> Well, I did already give you more time.
Oh, my goodness.<eos> I should've known that after 30 plus years of being here...<eos> Mr. Neal Gamby!<eos> Let me help you straighten up your desk because that would be dignified of me, wouldn't it?<eos> Let me help you with that.
What are you doing here?<eos> Hi, babe.<eos> Why would you answer to "dork"?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Can I help you with something, sir?
All right, very nice to see you.<eos> Justifies us being here.<eos> Means no one asks any questions about our other activities.<eos> Right, Tabby, collect all the phones.<eos> No calls in or out. Frisky, see if you can get Mr Birch some suitable gear.
The Devil has many names. What does this have to do with my father?<eos> He was a diplomat, was he not?<eos> Many expect the Beast to come from the world of politics.<eos> When Revelation was first written... It was the Emperor Nero that recognized him by his number... 666.<eos> Does that mean anything to you?
Yeah, that's me... real lucky.<eos> Ma'am, you need to stay behind the tape.<eos> Detective Shay, I'm Ann Rutledge, Mr. Thorn's counsel.<eos> You're not charged with anything.<eos> Why do you need a lawyer?
'Hey.' Mrs Webster, I said I'd call when I arrived.<eos> Do you really think you're going to find something out there?<eos> Well, I wouldn't have come if I didn't.<eos> 'No, I know.'<eos> Look, I want to believe you, it's just hard.
May I do that?<eos> - My dear boy, any friend of yours is welcome here!<eos> - Thank you.<eos> To the health and happiness of all, and the splendid recovery of our young friend here!<eos> I can't thank you enough, Count Rostov, and you, Countess, for your kindness to me.
- What's happened? Has it begun?<eos> - Yes, if you please.<eos> My master left a horse for you - all the gentlemen have gone, and General Kutuzov left an hour ago.<eos> Why didn't you wake me?<eos> My master said to let you sleep, Your Excellency.
So I'm alive, am I?<eos> Yes, Excellency.<eos> How long have I laid here?<eos> Days, Excellency.<eos> The doctors said to let you sleep.
Success pisses people off sometimes, but I play fair.<eos> We have a good company.<eos> No. There's no one I can think of who would do something like this.<eos> Okay.<eos> And, no, to save you the trouble, there's no one else.
Okay? We'll be watching you, making sure you and Mason are safe.<eos> Walk me through it again.<eos> You take these bags into your car, he'll be calling you with instructions for the drop-off.<eos> We'll be listening.<eos> We will follow you wherever he tells you to go.
Norah worked on projects that she couldn't talk about.<eos> She had signed papers, nondisclosure agreements.<eos> Oh, my God, the cat.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> You're planning some kind of mission to Mars, specifically to the volcano Arsia Mons, and Norah was helping you.
You're planning some kind of mission to Mars, specifically to the volcano Arsia Mons, and Norah was helping you.<eos> That's an interesting theory, except the technology to go to Mars is years away.<eos> That's what you want your competitors to believe, but Norah's parents told us that she was excited about a project at work, that it was going to take her away for a few months.<eos> You know what I think?<eos> I think she was helping you fast-track the technology, and she was training to go on the mission.
- It's true.<eos> She does. - I do.<eos> I really do.<eos> You don't have anything.<eos> An insider tip from a well-known cop is gonna open Pandora's box for you.
I'd let her do mine.<eos> We'd sit around for hours.<eos> She wanted to do makeup for Broadway shows, but she was never able to stay sober long enough to.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You sure I can't get you anything?
You don't seem that powerless to me.<eos> What do holy men need with weapons like these?<eos> We're commanded to use the tools that we have.<eos> What about Jason Rios?<eos> Hmm? Who commanded you to kill him?
He was just like me.<eos> So when he was old enough, I arranged for him to come to Sistex.<eos> I wanted to tell him.<eos> I wanted to tell Chris, but I just didn't know how.<eos> But somehow at that lunch, after he told you about his breakthrough, you finally figured out how to tell him.
All of the beauty you and I have made in this place, the art of it, they would have destroyed it.<eos> They would have destroyed you.<eos> I won't let that happen.<eos> Besides, we have a new story to tell.<eos> I will not help you.
All right, I'll see you tomorrow.<eos> Bye, Carrie.<eos> What's holding your attention on this little screen?<eos> Uh, here, look.<eos> I could send you the clip if you want it.
Oh, Mr. Amberson, you had me worried last night.<eos> I'm sorry about that.<eos> Oh, don't be sorry.<eos> I'm glad you're feeling better.<eos> Let me make you some fresh coffee.
May I take your coat, sir?<eos> - No, it's fine, thank you.<eos> The fella out front is gonna say, "No tables available."<eos> Sorry, sir, without reservation we won't be able to... So have cash.<eos> Oh, I think I can help you.
I'm here in more of an advisory capacity.<eos> Dan just, uh, wanted a friendly face next to him.<eos> ‭Well, we're all friendly here.<eos> Look at us. Four friends.<eos> We just want to get the facts straight so we can, um, help you get your property for you.
I know you?<eos> The young man who did that to you. He's my nephew...<eos> hothead, always has been.<eos> Kid thinks he's a boxer.<eos> He should have shown you respect.
My gun?<eos> Your gun from your pocket... he got it, and that's how his prints got on it.<eos> And then I'd be subject to the gun charge.<eos> You're an ex-cop.<eos> They'll go easy on you.
That's not really for my client to say, now, is it?<eos> He's not a forensics expert.<eos> Who knows? Maybe it, uh, fell from a passing bird's beak, and Mr. Salamanca caught it and tried to throw it away.<eos> I mean, the possibilities are endless.<eos> Did Salamanca threaten you, Mr. Ehrmantraut? Hey.
You gonna let this person victimize you twice?<eos> Forget about the gun, all right?<eos> The gun was not Salamanca's.<eos> If you try to introduce it into evidence, Mr. Ehrmantraut will make himself available to the defense, and he will set the record straight, categorically and unequivocally.<eos> Did he threaten you or pay you off?
Yer mind changes like a woman in flux.<eos> Trust I've a sound reason.<eos> - Good morning, master Murtagh. - Says you.<eos> _<eos> Milady has instructed that you have a proper meal to start your day.
So, now, we can prepare.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> We don't need to prepare.<eos> We just get there and explain your situation. And that's it.<eos> Mr. Fuller, I don't want you to get your hopes up.
- No, no, no.<eos> We don't need to prepare.<eos> We just get there and explain your situation. And that's it.<eos> Mr. Fuller, I don't want you to get your hopes up.<eos> He's gonna tell you the same stuff I've been telling you.
- Unbelievable.<eos> - Little chastity belt.<eos> Randy Royce!<eos> NYPD!<eos> Need to ask you a few questions.
Oh, so, just... wrong place at the perfect time.<eos> My specialty.<eos> How's that?<eos> Never mind.<eos> I'm gonna let you in on a little secret here, Detective.
Yeah.<eos> My mom says your fries are better than the ones in all of my dad's diners.<eos> Well, that's not what I thought I'd leave with here today, but it's something, so thank you.<eos> Sure.<eos> We hope it all works out for you. It'd be great if it did.
Stay down. Good girl.<eos> Move over.<eos> Halt!<eos> Stay in, but listen.<eos> We will show you into a tunnel. And you will spend the night there.
Please, you can't make a sound.<eos> Will you tell me your name?<eos> Mine is Antonina.<eos> A new hiding place can feel strange.<eos> But I promise you, you're going to be all right.
But this one,<eos> she was left behind.<eos> Quiet.<eos> This way.<eos> Women and children will stay here in the basement, until we can find a safe house that can take you.
-ButI 'mhelping.<eos> Bailey, stop! Bailey, Bailey, Bailey, Bailey, Bailey,<eos> -Okay. -Yeah.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you both for the ride.
Like... way bigger than this place.<eos> That's great.<eos> And how did Claire's parents feel about you and Wilson making contact like that?<eos> Or was that their idea?<eos> They must really trust you to let her stay here for the weekend.
I... I brought this for Claire.<eos> I thought she might be interested in her family tree, and there's photos.<eos> Yeah, well, we don't want you or your book.<eos> I'm asking you. Go home.<eos> I gave you a chance to raise this wonderful girl.
If you love her, then... you love a little piece of me, too.<eos> That's it.<eos> I'm calling the cops.<eos> You have everything in the world!<eos> Can't you just find it in your heart?
Everybody can see everything in here.<eos> How come we never got fucking blinds?<eos> Hello, Ruth. - Hi. - The boys and I are heading home.<eos> Ruth: Why?<eos> Bernie: I have to talk to you all. Ruth:
You know what I mean? Like Goldilocks just right. It's not too fancy, it's not too plain.<eos> It just...<eos> it just fits. No, no, it's like an old pair of slippers except instead of your foot, you put your cock in it.<eos> - You have a daughter, right?<eos> Yeah, Sophie. She's wonderful. I can't wait for you to meet her.
What if there's three and he says there's two and takes a billion and rides off into the sunset?<eos> Calm down, calm down.<eos> Everything is written down in a safe deposit box.<eos> If something were to happen to me, you consult with our lawyers, and they'll handle it.<eos> They'll fill you in on everything.
Find the boy. Kill him.<eos> And the sword will answer only to you.<eos> If you desire further help, you know the price.<eos> Bumped into the Vikings this morning.<eos> They insisted I give you this with their deepest apologies.
These represent the old families of England.<eos> Between them, they can rustle up 12,000 warriors.<eos> In order to stand a chance, we are going to need at least some of their support.<eos> We can arrange a meeting with six of those families... Let me stop you there.<eos> If I may, allow me to run you through the proceedings as I think they will unfold.
"Knights of the Bordello"?<eos> Or "The Ladies of the Knight."<eos> Have you finished?<eos> I'm gonna have to pull 'em on it.<eos> I'm glad you've got a sense of humor. 'Cause you're gonna need it.
Bill! Get on with it!<eos> - It's a trap.<eos> - How would he know?<eos> Don't know. Maggie. Maybe he knows she's working for us.<eos> I am telling you. That is not the king.
I've been sent by His Majesty to deliver a message.<eos> Let's think...<eos> "Be at the castle before dark" "if you wanna see the girl and the boy" "alive."<eos> I would love to stay and chat, but you do understand the situation between me and my wife.<eos> Anything that you do to me will be repaid 10 times in kind.
If you are so fucking sure of yourself why harass me for my wife's body?<eos> You had me at gunpoint!<eos> I was a hostage in my own house!<eos> Where did you think you're going with this harebrained scam?<eos> Are you guys completely insane?
This place seems okay.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hi. When does the next bus leave?<eos> Bus doesn't leave for about 36 hours.<eos> But I know a man who can take care of you.
I don't know.<eos> They don't want you to know the truth.<eos> No, that fork-tongued speaker of calumny shall rassle you down...<eos> Check it out. You think that's the asshole who woke me up?<eos> Everything that you thought was rued shall recede!
I found him in a ditch.<eos> - No!<eos> - Yes.<eos> People have no pity these days.<eos> Why do you think you can succeed?
10 days.<eos> Well.<eos> Each drawer is a cashier Contains dye packs and tracking devices.<eos> Dye packages and tracking devices.<eos> They will give you one of them if they can, But they will not endanger anyone's life To do this.
Do you know how to deal with a pistol?<eos> Made 300 shirts.<eos> Five days.<eos> Whenever you enter, You become better.<eos> When the time comes. You will come out of that bank And with you the amount of money. You have never seen her.
"The most beautiful in the world.<eos> "And I only ever made this world ugly.<eos> "Fergus needs things to be simpler.<eos> "I know how embarrassed he is about me.<eos> "I could not be the man that you both need.
It's Mark and Simon, right?<eos> Do you know who I am?<eos> Good.<eos> So you know that I own a couple of saunas in the north of Edinburgh.<eos> In fact, you boys should know, I own all the saunas in Edinburgh.
- I can hear you, Taylor, it's Kate, it's Kate! - Say something.<eos> - I hear you. - I read you loud and clear, Kate.<eos> - Oh, thank God.<eos> Oh, you have to help us.<eos> Are you both okay?
Don't leave me, Kate.<eos> I don't want to suffocate.<eos> No, it's going to be fine. I'm going to come back.<eos> Taylor, it's Kate.<eos> - Are you hurt?
All right. Well, you look better.<eos> How was Lucy yesterday?<eos> Different.<eos> Yeah. So were you.<eos> Keep thinking if your mum was still with us, she'd be out there now, kicking doors down, trying to find the little bastards that did that to you.
- Why did you attack the Walkers?<eos> - We got told to!<eos> We had no choice!<eos> Shut the fuck up, Cass, man!<eos> Who told you to?
Take it.<eos> She says it's yours.<eos> That's why you did it, right?<eos> Yeah, well...<eos> Look, I don't need it. You do, okay?
Silke, may I ask you to please read the quote?<eos> "Perhaps home is not a place, but simply..."<eos> Erm... "An irrevocable condition"?<eos> Bennie, I see you obviously... Consumed this book on the weekend.<eos> Yeah. Okay, I'll make it easy for you, erm...
Without a doubt.<eos> What are you guys doing now?<eos> We just chalking the field.<eos> Well, your lines are a little off, but I appreciate the hard work, kids.<eos> Let me tell you something.
Your teachers are fucking nuts!<eos> Man, this is fucked up.<eos> He's having a breakdown.<eos> - We can't prank him. - Shh!<eos> And you're gonna say, "Hey, I'm a nice guy. I'm doing okay."
When I saw what she did to Lily, yeah, I did, I got angry.<eos> I got in her face, I grabbed her arm, but I did not push her.<eos> And I think she might have slipped on purpose.<eos> Yeah, maybe the truth lies somewhere in between.<eos> Why would you believe the person who gave up on you instead of me?
How far do you think you can get?<eos> Twenty paces at most.<eos> Or do you think you can walk on water?<eos> It doesn't have to be this way.<eos> Just give me the rock and I will let you live.
- Eyes wide shut.<eos> - Keep your clothes on.<eos> I'll try.<eos> Not an alien ship from some other world as we suspected but rather a vessel constructed by an ancient, very human and long forgotten civilization.<eos> Now, even though the details of this startling conclusion have been transmitted to you, I thought it beneficial for you to meet the people responsible for so brilliantly translating these ancient writings.
Hey, it's interview time.<eos> Hello, handsome.<eos> My God, what happened?<eos> Dr. Allen, Miss Turner.<eos> Are you all right?
[Trini] There's a lotta mine security out tonight.<eos> - [Kimberly] Who is she?<eos> - [Jason] I don't know. I've never seen her before.<eos> - [cracking] - Oh, no.<eos> [Jason] Are you okay?
[Jason] Shall we do this?<eos> [Zordon] You need to follow the three rules to being a Power Ranger.<eos> You must never use your powers for personal gain.<eos> You must never escalate a fight, unless your enemy forces you to.<eos> And you must never reveal your identity. Ever.
What about you, dude?<eos> Why don't you tell us who you really are?<eos> Because everyone knows exactly who I am.<eos> Okay. What about you, crazy girl?<eos> I could tell you anything and you'd have to believe me.
Five little rangers tied up like fish.<eos> The leader?<eos> Oh, hello, Red.<eos> You're not entirely disappointing.<eos> Oh, look at you. Trying to figure out my plan. I'll just tell you.
You will humbly walk amongst your peers, but heroes you all will be.<eos> - Attention!<eos> Attention in detention.<eos> - [Zordon] Each of your names will be etched alongside the great ranger teams before you.<eos> I will always owe a debt of gratitude to you all.
And in the end the question of our context is inconsequential.<eos> If there is a design we are foregone to fit within it.<eos> And if there is no design, we are alone in our keep and no ground will hold us.<eos> It's time to wake up.<eos> Do you want me to make you guys some tea?
Fly ball, very deep.<eos> And the impossible dream just became the possible dream!<eos> You just gonna sit there?<eos> In the dark.<eos> You're enjoying this, right?
Yes.<eos> Yes. Absolutely, yes.<eos> The main feature of interest in the field of criminal investigation is not the sensational aspects of the crime itself, but rather the iron chain of reasoning, from cause to effect, that reveals, step by step, the solution.<eos> That's the only truly remarkable aspect of the entire affair.<eos> Now, I will share with you the facts and evidence as they were available to me, and in this very room, you will all attempt to solve the case of Blessington The Poisoner.
I'm now focusing on the difference to your mental capacity a specified consequence can make.<eos> Why should we bother?<eos> What if we're disinclined to play your games, little sister?<eos> Hm-hm!<eos> I have, if you remember, provided you with some motivation.
- Tim, there they are!<eos> - Mom, Dad!<eos> Imagine a puppy that never grows up... never gets old.<eos> A puppy that stays a puppy forever.<eos> I give you the only thing you'll ever love... the Forever Puppy!
I'm sure that's gonna turn out fine.<eos> Tim, what's happening?<eos> Mom, Dad, hold on!<eos> Yes!<eos> - Tim! Tim! Are you okay?
Hey!<eos> -I've had it with you! -No!<eos> Back up!<eos> Someone followed you through the jump point.<eos> Set me free, you'll need my help.
Don't worry. I'm not here to put you to sleep with some corporate speech like my boring sister might have.<eos> There it is!<eos> Lucy!<eos> we love you!<eos> No. I'm here to introduce you to a real superstar.
What do you mean, you have to get to her?<eos> Stop!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Elliot, stop!<eos> Let me help you!
Shit, he's coming. I got to get off the phone.<eos> Are you going to kill me?<eos> Yes, Darya.<eos> Shit!<eos> Darya... who hired you and Ray to kill me?
Jones.<eos> He's indisposed.<eos> Did you get our envelope?<eos> Yes, I did, thank you very much.<eos> Now, you listen to me. How much does he owe you?
Got ya.<eos> Hey, Fuscos? Yes?<eos> Sergeant. Just in time.<eos> Prints and DNA, please.<eos> Hey, I was just coming to tell you that those palm prints came back off that gun.
I'm afraid you're looking for something that isn't there.<eos> We'll be hiring our own team to do the looking.<eos> That's your prerogative.<eos> We have nothing to hide.<eos> But if you do manage to establish a connection to the emissions from that plant... our company still followed the law.
Thank you.<eos> To the precious Buddha, the unsurpassable teacher.<eos> To the precious dharma, the unsurpassable protection.<eos> To the precious sangha, the unsurpassable guides.<eos> To you three rare and supreme sources of refuge, I offer.
We have a new espresso machine.<eos> Cut the theatrics, Lawrence.<eos> Let's get this over with so we can pack our offices.<eos> Oh, your things have already been packed... uh, minus any Rand property, of course.<eos> The boxes will be released to you as soon as you sign your termination agreements.
Submit to me without further incident, and your friends will be granted a merciful death.<eos> I'll die before I let you touch them.<eos> I'm afraid I can't allow you to do that just yet, Mr. Rand.<eos> Kill the women.<eos> I just want you guys to know... I wish I'd never come to China with you.
Red is cinnabar and green is malachite. Blue is azurite and purple is barium copper silicate.<eos> This reagent can accurately show the mineral's compositions and color and will not damage the Terracotta warrior.<eos> Come over here.<eos> This is the result of our latest research.<eos> You will find color restoration much easier.
- Not like this.<eos> Right this way.<eos> My name is Danny Rand.<eos> Last year, you illegally transferred $243 million worth of assets through my family's company.<eos> And you thought you got away with it.
- No, I just...<eos> I just wanted to say, you might be right.<eos> So whatever your husband got into, it just keeps getting weirder and weirder.<eos> - What do you know?<eos> - I can't say, but I'm gonna work on getting you guys some protection.
They will not make you stronger.<eos> And if I might give you some advice, the more connections you have, the easier it will be to break you.<eos> What do you want to do with him?<eos> Well, I can't disclose that.<eos> But I'll tell you what I'm willing to do for him.
- What do you mean, "always"?<eos> - I traced it back to 1820.<eos> - That's all?<eos> - Why do you want Danny Rand?<eos> Nothing you can do can make me serve you.
- Danny, we're all on the same side here.<eos> - It doesn't feel like it.<eos> - Not anymore.<eos> - Don't do this.<eos> Hey, you guys seriously need to back off.
- Try again.<eos> What? No. We had enough to worry about.<eos> What aren't you telling us?<eos> I was with Elektra.<eos> It was a mistake not telling you guys about her. I realize that...
We were unified. Until you brought the Black Sky into the fold.<eos> Where is she?<eos> - She's safe.<eos> - What does that mean?<eos> I don't think I have to answer to you.
Kill Luke Cage.<eos> Kill Jessica Jones.<eos> And the Devil of Hell's Kitchen, whoever he is.<eos> I'm so happy you're all on board with the plan.<eos> But let me remind you, I neutralized our enemies.
So I intend to show exactly how democracy can and should be.<eos> Starting today, my every meeting, my every phone call and email will be accessible to my constituents and to the world...<eos> In real time!<eos> It will all be on my TrueYou page. That's right.<eos> Thank you!
Shit.<eos> I hope the engineers are watching, because that definitely shouldn't have happened, and it definitely won't happen again.<eos> You can trust me there.<eos> This is me brushing my teeth.<eos> If you're enjoying this, I'm worried about you.
But, uh, five months later, she calls me up, tells me she's pregnant.<eos> - Oh!<eos> - Mm.<eos> Christ, what am I gonna do here?<eos> And need I remind you, once she finds out that I'm not who I said I was, and that I don't have any money,
I'm sorry to hear that.<eos> Loose ends?<eos> You're not having a good night, are you, John?<eos> Gentlemen!<eos> Do I need to remind you, that there will be no business conducted on the Continental grounds?
Maureen's family was convinced of Dennis's guilt.<eos> Maureen?<eos> Maureen died three years ago.<eos> Dennis killed Bastet, all right?<eos> And let me tell you something.
He broke the thing's head clean off.<eos> It was gruesome.<eos> I still have nightmares about it.<eos> And I'm old.<eos> She told you what?
Look, if you can kill a crow, you can kill a cat.<eos> Cat, cat, cat...<eos> That's why I started recording all our conversations.<eos> I suspected Frank was probably recording all of our conversations, because of course he would.<eos> But let me tell you something, he was no fan of Maureen's, either.
Even the balloon kid knew it.<eos> Soon as he gets that ticket, he's going back in the closet. - Yeah.<eos> This isn't fair.<eos> - Mark my words.<eos> If he's gonna do it, he's got to stay out, which he won't, I guarantee you. Fine.
Monique lhuillier.<eos> Yeah. Mia.<eos> Mia, you know i barely recognized you.<eos> Yeah! The new me.<eos> Okay, what do you think?
But I'm happy that you're all here because I have an announcement to make.<eos> As most of you know, yesterday ros and I had a narrow escape.<eos> And something like that reminds us of what really matters and how important it is to seize the day.<eos> We should Cherish the people we care about and who care about us.<eos> Mom, dad, I know I haven't always been the perfect son. But I owe everything to you both, so thank you.
...the desert is super dangerous?<eos> They even blow things up out there, just for the fun of it.<eos> You should save some saliva, you know?<eos> Desert and all.<eos> Okay, do I need to remind you two that if you had dropped me off like I told you to, we--
We'll need a copy of the full guest list from Saturday night.<eos> Erm... yeah, sorry. Erm...<eos> Yes, you will need to speak to my husband Jim, he did the invites.<eos> His garage is in town.<eos> I'll give you his number.
The lasso of Hestia compels you to reveal the truth.<eos> But it's really hot.<eos> It is pointless and painful to resist.<eos> What is your mission?<eos> Whoever you are, you are in more danger than you think.
Go!<eos> Stay very very still, for me my friends.<eos> Please. It's so important.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> This has been such an honor for me taking you photograph.
And we could all be super heroes.<eos> I think we just need to... To take it slow.<eos> You know, I think it's better.<eos> Yeah, yeah, of course.<eos> Um... I made the bed for you guys so I'm gonna sleep on the sofa tonight.
Their destroyed homes, is back again,<eos> The government gave the house as well as repairs to damaged homes,<eos> I think silence is golden,<eos> The silence I think is very valuable,<eos> They want to know, you have proof, ,
Here's money for a cab, and if you want, why don't you come by set later?<eos> These things take forever.<eos> Lot of downtime.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - Give you two a minute.
Peace, Akhi.<eos> Peace, queen.<eos> A... A... Assalamu alaikum, my Asiatic black brothers.<eos> Kings of Africa.<eos> Peace be onto you and yours.
Thank you.<eos> Go kick that bitch's ass.<eos> Is that a doll in her toy box?<eos> Do we want her to come out and play with us?<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Mylene Cruz!
But this one's not going away.<eos> This is interesting.<eos> Why?<eos> Because that's here.<eos> Did you all enjoy that?
Is it gonna be... the Nerd or... the dark knight?<eos> To be honest I like both of you.<eos> A'rigt!<eos> Yeah..yea!<eos> But just before we get into all of that, Let me ask you one question.
No need.<eos> Cipher's still on the loose.<eos> There's been some reports she's in Athens.<eos> But she won't be nuking any city anytime soon.<eos> Thanks to you guys.
Then you wear a wire. You can't ask me to wear a fucking wire!<eos> Don't come to me with that!<eos> How you want me to come at you?<eos> That means I'm a fucking dead man! If I'm a dead man, you ain't got shit!<eos> You chose this.
And I'm here.<eos> I'm fucking here, man.<eos> I'm fucking here. I done everything you asked me to do.<eos> I can't help it if he ain't giving me shit...<eos> And I can't help you and your old lady if you don't give me shit.
I'm covered in explosives.<eos> Come on! Load her up!<eos> Where is Delaney?<eos> Busy.<eos> She is now under the flag of the Honourable East India, so you will have no hindrance.
I saw the papers with my own eyes.<eos> The assignation they were trying to make her sign gave Nootka to the Crown and only the Crown.<eos> Fucking snakes!<eos> If we didn't have so much shit on the Duke of Richmond, - they would have had her.<eos> - Who tipped you off?
- Yes, yes.<eos> You'll have to say it out loud.<eos> You witnessed the division of the gunpowder and you heard its destination.<eos> Yes, I did, sir.<eos> And you were both being paid for your services by James Keziah Delaney himself?
Oh... that we're in the version layer, that it's gonna be hot and smoggy tomorrow, and I told him that we are so lucky to have air-conditioning cooling our casino.<eos> Okay. Mr. Insurance Man, what do you want?<eos> Mr. Mitchum.<eos> Mr. Mitchum.<eos> I'm here to tell you something that you will want to know about.
Your new hotel, which burned badly down to the ground a few months back, was ruled arson by an official investigation.<eos> Now, I may have sold you your policy, sirs, but I didn't handle the claim.<eos> It was done by Douglas Jones, who works at our firm.<eos> - I thought you should know from me, unofficially, on my own... that this Mr. Jones did everything in his power to prevent you gentlemen from getting the insurance relief from the loss you suffered that I believe to this day you deserved.<eos> Douglas Jones seems to have a personal vendetta against you.
- Get that right up for you.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Hey, Norma.<eos> Shelly go home already? Yeah, she did.<eos> Oh, okay. I'll leave you two.
Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I wanna speak to you tonight about our effort in Afghanistan.<eos> It's an extraordinary honor for me to do so here at West Point, where so many men and women have prepared to stand up for our security and to represent what is finest about our country.<eos> As your commander in chief, I owe you a mission that is clearly defined...
But hopefully it can help you to rebuild, because rebuilding is what we're all about.<eos> And providing you with the security you need to live a long and prosperous life.<eos> Roads and schools and then jobs, so... you can raise your families, and jobs so you can put food on the table.<eos> The Taliban aren't gonna provide you jobs.<eos> The Taliban aren't here to help you.
Could she put a shirt on?<eos> Boom.<eos> Our very first project will be for each of you to do a family tree, where you get to talk about your wonderful family.<eos> Isn't that great?<eos> But before that, I am going to introduce you to a very, very special friend to our class.
They've been riding the storm and taking souls since long before I was born.<eos> Yeah, we won't survive them.<eos> Not without your help.<eos> Kira entrusted me with her sword while she's with the Skinwalkers.<eos> And now, I'm trusting you because I believe she would want me to.
He was remembering his son.<eos> Scott?<eos> Scott, can you hear me?<eos> Listen, I remember something.<eos> At the start of the year, Stiles was trying to find a place for you guys to live after graduation.
- 100%.<eos> - We will be.<eos> As soon as the FBI gives us back our files and our computers and our server.<eos> Which they said they will do.<eos> So, you're not under investigation?
But smiling and shaking hand...<eos> Ooh, shaking with both hands.<eos> - He's overcompensating.<eos> - So are you right now.<eos> Well, thank you both for everything.
Sophie has her hacktop.<eos> If she can figure out where the money comes from, we can at least let the IRS know.<eos> Or, you know, we could keep the money.<eos> It's not yours to keep.<eos> Yeah, but then I could pay you guys, and I could pay you back for all the money that you've loaned me over the last few decades.
You want to hire us?<eos> You are still a private investigation. And security firm, are you not?<eos> No thanks to you.<eos> I am aware of the irony of this situation.<eos> I tried to put you out of business, And now I am asking you. To find out who's trying to kill me.
The police have the dogs.<eos> Good, because, you know, they're both chipped.<eos> We didn't even think of that.<eos> The chips'll lead us to whoever registered the dogs.<eos> And that might give you the kincaids' real names.
Yeah. Fine.<eos> Where is it?<eos> There you are.<eos> This is agent melissa trumbull.<eos> What took you so long?
Yes, an unfortunate name.<eos> An unfortunate prison.<eos> It wasn't my creation.<eos> We can't unlock it, if that's what you want.<eos> So whatever magic she used to open it, I give you my permission to re-create it.
- You took out my heart.<eos> - And gave you a new one.<eos> One that will never break.<eos> That's where you're wrong.<eos> Today, I offer you a future.
It proves nothing.<eos> Possessions can be lost.<eos> And found.<eos> This boy is no Ozma.<eos> I am a Cardinal Witch and you will hear my truth or I'll gladly throw you back in prison if you find it more agreeable.
Mistress West freed your hides.<eos> She stands against those who truly act again the sisterhood.<eos> So help her to her feet.<eos> The Wizard has oppressed the magic that is your birthright... Its seeds sown into the fabric of this land.<eos> No one can take that away from you.
A little bit.<eos> - Mommy!<eos> Calm down, dear.<eos> - Mommy.<eos> Give me blood and I shall give you freedom.
We're at the knife's edge.<eos> What about this fellow Huth?<eos> Could he be of value to us?<eos> In what venture?<eos> There's bad blood between him and General Kellermann, they loathe each other, but how can that help you?
- We would miss you. - Madeline.<eos> We would miss you.<eos> You're gonna make me cry.<eos> And we're gonna win this case,<eos> I'm telling you.
- Wednesday. Today is my day.<eos> This is all too big.<eos> Too much going on at once.<eos> We should start with a story.<eos> - Aw, Jesus, Nancy. - I'm gonna tell you a story.
Remember 15-year-old Malika?<eos> Killed in Iraq?<eos> I picked up that pipe.<eos> She screamed, "What do you want?<eos> Want me to tell you you can rape me?"
Take swimming lessons. This is how we get stereotypes.<eos> Anansi...<eos> You want help?<eos> Fine.<eos> Let me tell you a story.
Now, how is that for a story?<eos> 'Cause that's the story of black people in America.<eos> Shit, you all don't know you black yet.<eos> You think you just people.<eos> Let me be the first to tell you that you are all black.
I like him.<eos> He's getting angry.<eos> Angry is good.<eos> Angry gets shit done.<eos> You shed tears for Compé Anansi, and here he is, telling you you are staring down the barrel of 300 years of subjugation, racist bullshit and heart disease.
Good health!<eos> Yeah, I am good, and... and thank you.<eos> Thank you so much. Xie xie.<eos> A million times over.<eos> We could never repay you.
She's dead.<eos> How did she die?<eos> Because of my dad.<eos> Let us come back into this moment.<eos> I now offer you the opportunity... to see the afterlife.
I don't know what bullshit he hauled your way, but he never visited my father in the hospital.<eos> If he told you that, it's a lie.<eos> He called and said he was gonna visit him, but he never showed up.<eos> This is gonna sound really strange, but did Pat have a tattoo?<eos> He told you about that?
Need time to think about it?<eos> All right.<eos> I don't need these.<eos> All right, now listen.<eos> If any of you idiots... think of taking this to the cops, let me remind you that I am me and you are you, right?
But it's a fear factor for a young girl, and of course, when you look up to your agent, he's been teaching you things, you're gonna believe what he says.<eos> Then when they finally do do interracial, when they're not getting enough work doing other things, they get paid more money for it.<eos> Going to the post office myself.<eos> 'Cause I want you all to get your books.<eos> And I want you to enjoy them.
Don't adjust your... whatever device you're hearing this on.<eos> It's me, live and in stereo.<eos> No return engagements, no encore, and this time, absolutely no requests.<eos> Get a snack. Settle in.<eos> Because I'm about to tell you the story of my life.
You're going to tell me this one's no big deal... but let me tell you about being lonely.
Clay. Right, right. Moving on.<eos> Where were we?<eos> Right.<eos> The auditorium.<eos> Oh, oh, but before we go... I want to show you something super cool.
Sit down, please.<eos> I already told you, it's not mine.<eos> Somebody must've slipped it in my bag.<eos> Do you have any idea who?<eos> Who told you to check my bag? Start with them.
I've told you about two of the worst decisions I ever made, and the damage left behind... and the people who got hurt.
Just checking.<eos> HOLY BIBLE No! That was not the deal.<eos> You people swore you could take the Saviors out.
Fighting with us, you'll be rewarded, more than you can imagine.<eos> Want something now.<eos> Rick...<eos> This group? They found me... Here, so far from our home.<eos> What do you need? Just tell us... We'll get it for you.
Whatever you want.<eos> Do you want a massage?<eos> Negan loves them. And I was a licensed therapist.<eos> Mm. While I appreciate the gesture and your commitment to your assigned objective, I am fully aware that none of you ladies are here this evening of your own volition.<eos> Video games are all about me showing all of you a fun time.
Hello. Are you all right?<eos> [Door closes] Better than that.<eos> You can call next, but it might be a while.<eos> Did you make the pills?<eos> I did. But you can't have them.
Turnabout and all that.<eos> Give us the pills, or we'll tell Negan about it.<eos> We'll tell him that it was your idea to make them and that you tried to get us to help.<eos> That would be a tactical error on your part.<eos> They'll believe me over you for the same reason he believed Dwight over the doctor.
You know what? I respect that.<eos> Tequila.<eos> Mental note. Locked.<eos> No need to talk. This is hopefully a quick visit.<eos> Well, what can I do for you?
Put the gun down, and let's talk about what we can change.<eos> No. Leave right now.<eos> ♪♪<eos> We just wanna be left alone.<eos> Yeah, we'll leave you alone.
We're not gonna lose anymore -- not our guns, not our safety, not after everything we've done to get here.<eos> We're gonna win -- with your guns, with or without your help.<eos> ♪♪<eos> Natania, put the gun down.<eos> You kill me, and you die. And my people take the guns and nothing changes.
Sorry about the gun.<eos> You know, it's dangerous.<eos> It's all right.<eos> Why don't you guys come down to the gym?<eos> I'll give you a... give you some training for free, yeah?
Yeah, it was a thousand bucks.<eos> You know, Amy feels uncomfortable.<eos> I wasn't even thinking about that.<eos> That was so fuckin' rude, man.<eos> I wasn't bigtiming you.
If they try get you to stay longer, tell them no.<eos> We've shot here before.<eos> They're cool.<eos> I'm not finished.<eos> They try to ask you to do something you're not comfortable with, politely tell them to fuck right off and call me.
We've shot here before.<eos> They're cool.<eos> I'm not finished.<eos> They try to ask you to do something you're not comfortable with, politely tell them to fuck right off and call me.<eos> They did not buy the right to do anything they want to you.
Why do we have to go into the garage?<eos> You know it is required.<eos> I want to be alive!<eos> I am alive!<eos> Alive, I tell you!
Alan, I'm not proud of what's happening here, but if you keep coming at me, there's gonna be another passenger on that ghost train.<eos> Guys!<eos> I figured it out.<eos> - Congrats!<eos> - You did it it!
Come on, guys, we're all thinking it.<eos> Don't...<eos> Don't make me say it.<eos> Oh, okay. This again.<eos> You know, I could have made you a device to detect Doomnomitron from orbit like that.
You know, I could have made you a device to detect Doomnomitron from orbit like that.<eos> I'm not the one that didn't want you back.<eos> Alan was. If you lay those deaths at my doorstep one more time...<eos> Do not threaten her.<eos> Congrats, you did it.
I'll cover that bet.<eos> I get it.<eos> Well, Morty, I think you're doing that smirky face because you're misinterpreting the moment.<eos> I am not being coy about some hidden love for you.<eos> I want to be really clear that if anyone has a better guess, like, if I gave you an amulet last night, or...
To be clear, you had a problem as you said last year.<eos> The real estate business, well this is a bad business.<eos> So you tried the normal channels, the banks, but you're companies still failing so you come to us.<eos> For a loan.<eos> You never thought to ask why we might lend you one million dollars with no collateral required?
Properties, cash flow, so we can better disguise our activities.<eos> Look, we just wanna pay the money back and you know, be on our way.<eos> As I said, the first sum was an investment for you to keep.<eos> All future funds will be run through the front office, the same as other Stussy income.<eos> A few thousand a month, more or less, now I can get you the specs and instructions.
Which we've told you, we're happy to pay back with interest.<eos> You see, that's the problem with you Americans.<eos> You watch too many movies, and you think the deal can always be changed, and it can't.<eos> We're partners now, and that's all there is to it.<eos> So, you might as well just lie back, as they say, and enjoy yourselves.

Now, I suggested he take a step back and allow me to run the day-to-day, but he seems adamant that we stick together.<eos> Pre-schools in Mumbai, health clinics in Inner Mongolia, better access to veterinary care.<eos> There's... _<eos> Women, more so.<eos> And you'd be okay with that, selling a business that you worked so hard to build?
Wait. We have fake books?<eos> Let's go deeper. Away from the road.<eos> Forty grand.<eos> That, plus the 10 you stole, puts it 50.<eos> My thought, then, is you should leave the state.
Lieutenant!<eos> Come inside!<eos> Don't stand there in the rain.<eos> Oh, there she is.<eos> We'd have offered you shelter in our mill, but you saw what happened to it.
Don't be shy.<eos> You like helping people, don't you?<eos> Yes, when I can.<eos> Could you help me?<eos> You?
Be quiet, and let the lieutenant explain.<eos> You just need to swear that you witnessed the wedding.<eos> I'm sure that if you do, you'll be rewarded.<eos> Do you think she might lower the rent?<eos> She might even give you the mill.
Why not?<eos> Don't tell me you did all this just to have me as a reward.<eos> You're a good man.<eos> I wish you well.<eos> Perhaps one day, I'll be able to help you or your son, like you helped mine.
I didn't marry, on principle.<eos> But I recognised my son.<eos> Look at me!<eos> Not like that sod who turned his back on you.<eos> And thanks to you, that sod is now my husband.
You can tell because he carved an X on the bottom of it.<eos> Yes, please.<eos> My God.<eos> There it is.<eos> Looks like Mr. Metzger left you quite the legacy there.
For a moment there, I thought I might have changed some minds.<eos> You did.<eos> Just don't expect to change his.<eos> Whatever happened to government of the people, by the people, for the people?<eos> I'll tell you what happened.
If they're not men, what are they?<eos> Please, to speak of them may summon them.<eos> From where?<eos> - You tell me nothing.<eos> - Can we not simply give you the silver and be on our way, Lord, please?
That he fears you is enough.<eos> Let him take that fear to Kjartan.<eos> May we free the prisoners, Lord, search the pens for a friend, the king?<eos> You may.<eos> I have no business with you.
Beocca, they love me!<eos> Because they have no idea what a fool you are!<eos> Be careful, priest, or he will have your head.<eos> Not before he feels my boot!<eos> And may I present to you Queen Hild of the water bucket, scourge of slavers and once thrown out of the nunnery!
The cocksure long-haired fool over there. Is he a danger?<eos> - To whom, Abbot?<eos> - To each one of us, and to our purpose.<eos> Although he lacks humility, Uhtred is the reason we are alive.<eos> Ah, he gave you protection out of the goodness of his heart, did he?
If these people are successful in compromising the first, there is no end to the damage they can cause the rest.<eos> In this war... you and I have far more that unites our interests than separates them.<eos> For if Nassau falls, if it becomes a dark symbol of what mayhem these men can unleash, a rallying cry that might be heard throughout the New World... how long before these same men turn their eyes to Cuba?<eos> To your plantations and your ships?<eos> How long before Spanish slaves are emboldened by it and set their eyes on you?
Fight them! Do not accept them as your friend and your ally!<eos> The Prophet Muhammad had Christians and Jews as his allies.<eos> Ben and I would go in together.<eos> If we make contact with Gabriel, we'll see if he knows how to find Jadalla Bin-Khalid.<eos> Why limit the operation to you and Grimes?
- Mullins?<eos> Eric... are you hearing what you want to hear from Grimes, convincing yourself you can trust him?<eos> Why would I do that?<eos> Because you blame yourself for what happened today.<eos> Look, Rebecca, I told you and Mullins what I think.
I... I won't.<eos> I won't-won't do it.<eos> I'm sorry. What did you say?<eos> I said,<eos> I won't help you recover your files.
We'll see.<eos> I'm gonna ask you again.<eos> How did you and Jadalla Bin-Khalid communicate?<eos> Mr. Donovan. You have to know that by keeping quiet, you're putting thousands of American lives in danger.<eos> I keep telling you I don't know what you're talking about.
_<eos> Jadalla Bin-Khalid took Carter's wife and Carter traded himself and Andy.<eos> If we can track them, they'll lead us right to Jadalla.<eos> Fix the flash drive. Recover the data on it.<eos> I won't help you recover your files.
It's got a firewalled router, but I should be able to get through it.<eos> Tell me how long until a bomb tech gets here?<eos> We can get someone there in 20 minutes.<eos> That's too long.<eos> Listen, I'm gonna send you a picture of the device.
Sorry.<eos> I've already been paid.<eos> I always finish a job once I've been paid.<eos> I got a reputation to keep.<eos> I won't let you take the girl.
The other lives in a cave and talks to sheep.<eos> They each think the other has it better.<eos> I regret to inform you, the Baudelaires' fate was worse.<eos> Chop-chop, Baudelaires!<eos> Now that I've found you a suitable guardian, I'm going to take you to your new home before banking hours begin.
Laundry room.<eos> You can hang my underwear on that rack when you're done washing it.<eos> This is the backyard, which needs weeding, mowing and pruning.<eos> It is also where you will chop wood.<eos> Bathroom number seven, the only one you are allowed to use.
Rats bite.<eos> And this is where you will sleep, orphans.<eos> Out of all the numerous bedrooms in this enormous mansion, I have chose this one for your safety and comfort.<eos> There's only one bed.<eos> As you can see, I have provided, at no cost to you, this complimentary pile of rocks.
First of all, first impressions are often wrong.<eos> Very true.<eos> For example, your first impression of me may be that I am a terrible person.<eos> But in time, Baudelaires, I hope you'll come to realize... you haven't the faintest idea.<eos> I'll give you a moment to unpack.
I'm gonna cut back on DJing and we're gonna take care of Carlton together.<eos> So, you're coming home!<eos> And I want you to know we'll be here for you all the way.<eos> Oh, I'll get him.<eos> I mean, if that's okay with you.
I doubt it.<eos> I see this as a tremendous growth opportunity for both of us.<eos> We just came here because we thought you were jerking our chain.<eos> I'm very serious.<eos> If you give me a chance, I'd like to explain why.
Yeah, it sounded a little stalkery.<eos> Didn't mean it like that.<eos> What did you mean?<eos> Bug's been a bud for a while.<eos> We know what you did for him.
Yeah, it sounded a little stalkery.<eos> Didn't mean it like that.<eos> What did you mean?<eos> Bug's been a bud for a while.<eos> We know what you did for him.
- ...will find you.<eos> To Teagan.<eos> The best sister anyone could hope for.<eos> I love you.<eos> And I wish you and Tom all the best.
Me, too.<eos> Me, too.<eos> Open it up with Raj if you don't mind. It'll just mean more that way.<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> And once again, congratulations to you both.
Over here, male narrative.<eos> And what's with the hair?<eos> - What's with the hair?<eos> - Yeah, what's with the hair?<eos> Don't know what you're talking about.
But don't they also want to put a foot in his ass and take his spot?<eos> Come on.<eos> You know Head of Crim is the hyperloop that propels you into whatever job you want next.<eos> How to get it...<eos> Let me tell you.
We should write this shit down.<eos> Not good for MCC.<eos> Barring the arrest... I hope you get everything you want.<eos> I've never been able to make a difference here.<eos> Maybe you'll have better luck.
Honored to oblige.<eos> Just as soon as you pass the test.<eos> Of course there's a test.<eos> As you know, only a Child Of Earth can wear the crown of the High King.<eos> I will ask you a series of questions designed to root out all pretenders to the throne.
He is the head of the facility where Zack was institutionalized.<eos> Dr. Roshan, thank you so much for being here.<eos> Do you have any idea how Zack managed to escape?<eos> Uh, not yet.<eos> Unfortunately, as you are aware,
Good-bye... Dr. Addy.<eos> Zack, you okay?<eos> I couldn't do it.<eos> Ow. I couldn't kill him.<eos> Hey. I just wanted to give you guys the good news.
He called.<eos> And, uh, did he say where he was going?<eos> I have no idea where my husband is.<eos> Well, there's somebody out there who's been helping him.<eos> Believe me, if I knew who was helping my husband, I would tell you.
Wait. We're in it.<eos> Brennan the beetle, Cam the caterpillar.<eos> Yeah, we're all in it.<eos> It's-it's about us.<eos> Cam has something to tell you both.
_<eos> I'm with Chris.<eos> I'm sitting out too.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you all.
Uh, you too.<eos> God, this is strange, isn't it?<eos> It feels kind of like a blind date.<eos> Yeah. A little.<eos> Well, I just wanted to thank you in person.
Could you all please stop yammering and just get on with it?<eos> I have to wash the blood from Gaston's coat before it sets.<eos> You need to be patient.<eos> Ma'am, please, we're trying to solve a murder here.<eos> If my dog's fur ends up pink, I promise you, there will be hell to pay.
Said he had to talk it over with his business partner.<eos> Any idea where he was headed when he left?<eos> Just that he was tied up all weekend.<eos> Now, look, if we're done here, I got business to deal with.<eos> Oh, but hey... just to prove there's no hard feelings, I'll let you test drive a couple of floor models in exchange for spreading the word about my dolls at the FBI.
This is the common area, where we do our dog therapy, among other activities.<eos> Who had access to the room last night?<eos> All the staff and residents have full access 24/7.<eos> This is Sam, one of our orderlies.<eos> He'll clear the area so you won't be disturbed.
You fought with him.<eos> His facial bones were broken.<eos> There's extensive fracturing to the ribs.<eos> You hit him so hard your hand was broken.<eos> Who told you about that?
No. No. Those kids, they idolized him.<eos> I used to joke, those rich kids were just a paycheck.<eos> Austin, he made them feel like it was something else, like they were friends or something, you know?<eos> They loved him.<eos> I'm telling you, look at the parents.
It's a steel cable that lumberjacks use to scale the pole in the tree climb event.<eos> Belonged to our victim.<eos> You think this could be the murder weapon?<eos> It definitely fits the parameters.<eos> Hold on a second. I can tell you for sure. Can you hold that out?
I actually think it's a photograph of a painting printed on regular printer paper.<eos> All the blue, maybe a seascape.<eos> Temperance.<eos> Sully?<eos> Uh, we'll just give you two a minute.
Why?<eos> Because I'm a woman?<eos> I didn't say that.<eos> Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, no. On second thought, I order you both to participate.<eos> On the one hand, you'll get a better handle on who Dustin's accomplice was if you're on the inside, and on the other hand, I think the aggression of the derby will be rather therapeutic for you, Dr. Brennan.
- Ah. If you added crushed almonds that would be a delicious Moroccan dish called amlou.<eos> Or more likely, it's a high-end hair oil, but I found none of that in the victim's own hair.<eos> Which would suggest that he put his fingers in another person's hair just prior to death.<eos> Huh. Well, I'll let Booth know.<eos> How are you guys coming?
Okay. Okay.<eos> Well, I'll go get Booth.<eos> Yeah. Hey, Ange?<eos> Keep yourself safe, huh?<eos> ♪ La-Di-da-Di-Di... ♪ Hey, sorry to interrupt you guys.
Will he be giving an update on President-elect Vargas' condition?<eos> Not at this time.<eos> Can you give us an update now?<eos> The President-elect is being treated by a team of the best doctors and surgeons on the East Coast.<eos> As soon as they have an update, you will, too.
- Liv, it's over.<eos> - No.<eos> We fought a good fight.<eos> - I'm glad we looked into this...<eos> - Don't you do that.
Now, like all of you, I am awed by his artistic talent, but I promise you... the greater privilege is to know Kyle West the person.
Unbelievable.<eos> Nothing has changed, has it, Em?<eos> Nicole Gordon, one of the 15 missing<eos> American aid workers has been found alive.<eos> Do you really think we'd let you leave?
I have to go to a jewelry designer in Milford.<eos> Call me after you've had your coffee.<eos> Alright, "Twelfth Night" paper is due on Friday.<eos> If you haven't picked a theme, please do so.<eos> It helps if you actually read the play.
Someone sent you a finger.<eos> - Are you sure that it's.....<eos> - Archer Dunhill's, yes.<eos> The prints were a match.<eos> Do you have any idea who sent it or why?
Mary.<eos> Whole time we were talking to Pastor Ted she was just fifteen, twenty feet away.<eos> - I gotta go.<eos> - Yeah, me too.<eos> - I'll help you after school.
There's lots of evidence.<eos> And there's probably more to come.<eos> But the question is, why are you telling us this?<eos> I thought it was obvious.<eos> I am giving you a chance to tell your side of the story before my side becomes the only side.
Yeah, you too.<eos> You can tell Ali you love her in front of me, M.<eos> That hasn't been a secret since we were in Brownies.<eos> Okay, please, use shouldn't be touching that.<eos> You still don't realize how badly you need me, do you?
That she screwed up?<eos> That she got scared and made a mistake?<eos> There isn't a person in this room who hasn't made a big mistake and doesn't have to live live with it.<eos> Do you know what makes A.D. so dangerous?<eos> She can't forgive, that is the only edge any of you ever have had over her and now you don't even have that.
'Cause I see her.<eos> I see her right now.<eos> None of you are really certain who you are.<eos> I did that.<eos> I took that away from you the same way everything was stolen from me.
I'd like to go over the major points one more time.<eos> Of course.<eos> Well... I killed Archer Dunhill.<eos> I ran him over with a car that I stole and I buried his body in the woods.<eos> Later I moved it to where I told you you'd find it.
You might find some problems.<eos> Depends how motivated you are to look closely.<eos> Poseidon killed your deputy director.<eos> He was a cancer inside your agency for years.<eos> I've shown you his face!
- Hi!<eos> Thanks for having us over. Aw.<eos> Enjoy your freedom while you can. You look gorgeous, as always.<eos> You guys need to stop bringing him.<eos> Okay, I have something to show you guys.
Major is a zombie.<eos> - Peyton's sleeping with Blaine.<eos> - Slept with.<eos> Once. Is it too late to say that I kind of liked being out of the loop on some of this?<eos> It's in the spirit of this new honesty that I want to tell you about a moment I shared with Vivian Stoll.
Welcome, Chuck Burd Nation! Gather around patriots, truth-seekers and those who believe we need to reset the tree of liberty.<eos> And we all know what that sound is, we have a bombshell today, UpChuckers.<eos> - This is it.<eos> - With me in studio right now, is Billy Cook, eyewitness to the bloodbath at the Max Rager headquarters, and what he is about to impart upon us, my friends, is going to confirm everything.<eos> Your government is plotting against you.
We recognize Ice Nation rule, and you honor Lexa's coalition, including the 13th clan.<eos> No.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on. Almost there.<eos> We'll give you guns and show you how to use them.
Pete.<eos> Thanks for taking care of Armando.<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> I enjoy delivering speeches just about as much as I do hearing them.<eos> But considering we got a lot of people here who've traveled many a mile, and given that only the devil knows if I'm gonna be standing here this time next year, I figured I better pay you all my respects.
Not that I... love the Westside.<eos> You can never find parking.<eos> Well, at least on our side, we have Pier 1, which I love.<eos> Over there at the Grove, all you have is Cost Plus World Market. I mean, all that is just junk.<eos> You too? Was it hard getting an appointment?
And starving yourself can make you feel euphoric, like a drug addict or an alcoholic.<eos> It's not about "thin enough," right?<eos> There's no "thin enough." It doesn't exist.<eos> What you crave is the numbing of the thing that you don't wanna feel.<eos> And we give you a lot of rope here.
What I'm trying to say is, why does she get to leave the house when she's only level two?<eos> - It was Luke's night out.<eos> - Yeah, but Ellen got to go.<eos> It's "Eli" now.<eos> It might make you feel better to know that Dr. Beck scheduled a special trip for you guys in a couple of days.
Good to see you, pal.<eos> Eddie, this is Bay.<eos> - This is Travis's girlfriend. - Wow!<eos> - I always knew this kid had good taste. - Mm-hmm.<eos> - Uh, I hope you don't mind me crashing dinner.
They said it was joint enterprise, but the whole trial was a joke.<eos> I wasn't even close enough to touch the guy when it kicked off.<eos> But the judge didn't like my face, so...<eos> And you've got no idea why Gemma would've been calling your probation officer?<eos> If I knew, I'd tell you.
My dream is that one day, there will be no Cog,<eos> Clipper, Doll, or Baron.<eos> Only free women and men deciding the course of their own future.<eos> What happens if we don't buy into your big dream?<eos> You'd rather be a slave in a system that doesn't give a damn about you?
And I'm the only way to survive what's coming next.<eos> The hour is upon us.<eos> The enemy we are about to face is unlike any other.<eos> He is the greatest killer I have ever trained.<eos> But I remind you of that which is more dangerous than any killer...
- Yes, Baron! - And you, my friend?<eos> - Yes, Baron!<eos> - Like I am, Gabriel transformed his flesh into Hellfire to smite our enemies!<eos> Not only did he die a martyr, he was reborn a god!<eos> Is that what he tells you?
Hurry!<eos> All right, darling.<eos> If I remember what my mum taught me, this should only take a second.<eos> Oh, yes!<eos> Who gave you permission to be in this area?
They will wish they had never lived at all.<eos> Those men outside...<eos> They saw you on TV.<eos> They said you had special skills.<eos> You were right the first time.
How do I know you won't get bored and run off someplace like you always do?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> - You two need to talk.<eos> I'm going to utilize the facilities and give you two time to fix this thing, whatever it is.
No.<eos> Right now, I just want to go home, spend some time with my family.<eos> Mrs. Mahoney, are you happy to put this all behind you?<eos> No, because it isn't behind us.<eos> Can you tell us what you mean by that?
- I never killed anyone.<eos> - Neither have I!<eos> - You hacked up my husband, dumped his body in a garbage bin.<eos> Because of Wes, okay?<eos> ! We were all trying to help him and you.
He's been kidnapped, Laurel!<eos> Maybe you coped fine in that situation, but Connor didn't grow up in a drug cartel.<eos> He's not properly prepared to be a hostage.<eos> My dad owns a telecommunications company, so way to go with the stereotypes.<eos> I need you all to shut up so I can tell you something!
You bring Omar car, but not Omar?<eos> Omar had to go somewhere safe.<eos> Because of the war?<eos> Yeah, the war. That's right.<eos> He told us to bring this stuff for you.
Not a lot of employers lined up to take a chance on me.<eos> Besides, this ship provides opportunities for my side business... which is the real reason I'm on this boat.<eos> This baby... houses my entire life savings. I'm telling you, it's gonna be huge.<eos> I'm a few months away from putting all this behind me.<eos> If you guys are lucky, I'll let you guys take one of my ladies for a spin.
Whom did you say they were going to replace?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Mr. Skuttle, they're ready for you.<eos> Wish me luck.<eos> What can I get you folks?
"Error"?<eos> Heavens, no.<eos> An opportunity.<eos> An unpredictable narrative device.<eos> I've given you a story.
Heavens, no.<eos> An opportunity.<eos> An unpredictable narrative device.<eos> I've given you a story.<eos> I have given you a show.
Better than dying, huh?<eos> Where'd you learn to screw like that... the Boy Scouts?<eos> Maybe for you.<eos> We recalibrated the pulse charges, so good luck fucking your way out of another loss tomorrow.<eos> I let you live because I enjoy a good show, but you try that trick one more time or even bore me for a single moment, you'll see what I'm really capable of.
Not yet, you're not.<eos> You're welcome to join us.<eos> I'm good.<eos> Your loss.<eos> I'll give you two a minute.
I was tracking the killer, but I'm afraid I arrived too late.<eos> Don't believe anything he says.<eos> Seelies can't lie.<eos> Yeah, but they'll spin the truth until you're dizzy.<eos> I can help you find the killer.
What do you think you're doing?<eos> Renegotiating the terms of our partnership.<eos> And it is going to be a partnership.<eos> We need a bit more of a guarantee that you're going to uphold your end of our bargain.<eos> I'll guarantee you one thing.
Huh. So you're kinda like a shark who'll die if you stay in one place.<eos> We are all going to die if you don't...<eos> It's too late.<eos> It's here.<eos> Ah, well, the good news is you two finally got what you wanted, you managed to balance our partnership.
I'll be everywhere...<eos> every hour, every minute.<eos> And then, I will rule from the Big Bang until the end of the world.<eos> You wanted us to build this thing.<eos> Well, why do you think I let you idiots live?
- Yeah.<eos> What's up?<eos> You put your hands on me like that one more time, and I'll kick your ass.<eos> Good talk.<eos> Ooh! This is why I usually leave the punching to you guys.
Please have a seat.<eos> And congratulations.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It was a great night.<eos> Get you anything?
- Drive!<eos> - You, too!<eos> This is harassment!<eos> Will, thank you so much for dinner.<eos> Oh, hey, I just wanted to thank you all in advance, 'cause I know this wedding has been an inconvenience.
- Me next.<eos> - All right.<eos> Knock, knock.<eos> I got a bunch of meds your mom sent up for you.<eos> I tell you, with all those prescriptions,
So I talked to my brother, and he's starting a big commercial job,<eos> - and he's willing to give you another chance.<eos> - Oh, uh... thanks.<eos> Yeah, I'll call him.<eos> Well, I should probably let you boys get back to work.
I want him to get that help.<eos> What you want... is to cage him up like an animal, like the animal who killed his father.<eos> He put an arrow in his chest.<eos> What kind of monster does that?<eos> Whatever my son is doing, he is doing it because he is hurt and he is scared, and I will not help you destroy his life.
Hey, stop.<eos> Mr. Queen, you do not have floor.<eos> Just give me 10 seconds.<eos> Listen to what I have to say.<eos> If you don't like it, shoot me.
He said the team's over?<eos> Like, we're supposed to just sit back and let Chase run wild?<eos> Nobody's sitting around, Rene.<eos> Look, Oliver's in a bad place right now, but he will get it together.<eos> I don't have to remind any of you of how strong he is.
No. I'm saying that the details of an ongoing investigation are confidential.<eos> Yes?<eos> I spent the afternoon speaking with Gay Eked's father.<eos> What do you have to say to him and the families of all of Prometheus' victims?<eos> Well, I would say to them what I am saying to you.
You want to set a trap for Helix and use James as the bait?<eos> I don't think I need to tell either of you how dangerous Helix is.<eos> This is our chance to take them down.<eos> This is happening with or without your help.<eos> I'll let you boys wrap your head around that.
We're not going anywhere.<eos> We're not abandoning you. I understand that you're not abandoning me.<eos> You're doing what I'm asking you to do because ch...<eos> Chase knows how I think.<eos> He knows that if he puts the two of you in danger... And he's going to try to... that...
Please come home to me, Ollie...<eos> To thea, your mother.<eos> We need you.<eos> If you don't, then your father and my sister would have died for nothing.<eos> We're ok. You ok? We're fine.
I need to put the Institute first.<eos> Listen... I'm not abandoning anyone,<eos> I'm sending my best Shadowhunter to go and rescue them.<eos> Get me a portal to Idris.<eos> I will... but there's something you should know about this Lake.
One almost punctured me.<eos> If that had gone through to the inner hull, your girl would have snapped in two.<eos> Most ships would have been blown to scrap after that kind of beating.<eos> Yeah, well, not the roci.<eos> I'm actually impressed as hell you were able to make it back here.
God, I hate space.<eos> Holden: You're gonna want tohearthisstory.<eos> Now what story is that?<eos> Maybe it's the one about why the rock I sent you to exploded into a nuclear fireball?<eos> Or what happened to the opa operative I tasked you to find?
Man: Welcome to tycho station.<eos> Nowthisis allcommercial districtsaroundhere.<eos> Restaurants,bars,brothels, allthatgoodstuff.<eos> Supply depot's about four sections in.<eos> They're a friendly bunch, they'll have whatever you need.
They're a friendly bunch, they'll have whatever you need.<eos> Union offices are about two levels down from here, and the tycho station admin, just past that.<eos> Y'all can apply for assistance at either one of those, if you need.<eos> Now your lodgings are gonna be right around that corner, all right?<eos> But I can set you up and get you transport if you want to go somewhere else, so don't be shy.
We will honor those existing contracts.<eos> But we'll be adding 30 more positions to the nauvoo.<eos> The rest will come from other bids, all new work.<eos> Yeah, go on, coyo.<eos> Keep licking the earther's hand, maybe he toss you a few more scrap from his table.
I think it's best that we save this town.<eos> Please forgive me.<eos> While you work to save all our lives, I must see to one small but... precious life.<eos> My men guard the door.<eos> No one will disturb you.
Iholedup there.<eos> Why'd you leave?<eos> Someone shot me.<eos> Iwentlookingfor help andI gotgrabbed.<eos> Look, you got zero options here, man. Okay? Zero time.
I'm not afraid.<eos> You don't know me.<eos> What you've seen of my family, I'd run.<eos> But we're building something back at home. Something with a future.<eos> Let me show you that.
You don't know me.<eos> What you've seen of my family, I'd run.<eos> But we're building something back at home. Something with a future.<eos> Let me show you that.<eos> Look, if you see it and you think it's bullshit, fine.
I guess when I hacked together the video chat as an in-house tool, I didn't foresee that hundreds of thousands of people would shit themselves over how fucking awesome it was.<eos> I'll never underestimate my talents again.<eos> Don't worry. I'll continue to do it for you.<eos> Less talk, more work, boys.<eos> I'm not paying you to coffee klatsch like a bunch of fucking yentas.
The King in the North! The King in the North!<eos> Our uncle Euron returned home after a long absence.<eos> He murdered our father, and took the Salt Throne from Yara.<eos> He would have murdered us if we'd stayed.<eos> Build me a thousand ships, and I will give you this world.
You're wondering why I brought you all here.<eos> After all, we just had a feast.<eos> Since when does old Walder give us two feasts in a single fortnight?<eos> Well, it's no good being Lord of the Riverlands if you can't celebrate with your family. That's what I say!<eos> I've gathered every Frey who means a damn thing so I can tell you my plans for this great house now that winter has come.
We don't skimp, neither.<eos> The cream from the milk, the softest crumb you've got at hand.<eos> For it's favor on one side of the coin, and wrath on the other.<eos> Ballybogs, no doubt, they can be reasoned with. Leprechauns, oh, they're a different story altogether.<eos> Help you with your troubles one day, and bite your eyes out the next.
Not over no hurt nigger. Ain't that right?<eos> Gonna be more trouble than it's worth, trying to get a man who can't walk to collect a reward.<eos> Anybody can see his ankle broken.<eos> So how's about we make a sale right here?<eos> I's give you five dollars for him.
You see that ash on that window?<eos> He come by every day right after the slop brought in.<eos> He share one of them cigarettes with some of the others. Probably the guy that opens that gate.<eos> Y'all notice he smell like smoke?<eos> Now, maybe if you made your move at dinnertime, you'd've got past the gate. But you'd've ran right into the marshal's office across the street.
Hilarious.<eos> Again!<eos> If you insist!<eos> 25 milligrams of sodium pentothal.<eos> Give him a few minutes, he'll tell you what you need to know.
Gingers not your type?<eos> I remember.<eos> You're Jim Gordon's little... Twinkie.<eos> Easy.<eos> How's it going between you and Jimbo?
That's better.<eos> Well, I think we can all agree tonight was a rousing success.<eos> We brought this miserable city to its knees.<eos> So, how to thank the best darn cult of fanatics a messiah like myself could ever hope for?<eos> I give you...
I should have been able to sacrifice my happiness for his.<eos> I couldn't.<eos> But I'm ready now.<eos> I won't... call... Ed.<eos> I won't let you hurt him!
Lay it on me.<eos> Watch and learn.<eos> Oh, yoo-hoo. Canolli guy.<eos> Hey, quick question.<eos> If I had information, like, really good information that would get you a ton more money for Penguin, would you let me go?
The Court cannot be exposed.<eos> We would clean this up on our own, but there are too many eyes watching.<eos> However, this does afford us an opportunity, James.<eos> To prove my loyalty.<eos> You want me to find Nygma and bring him to you?
You know that, right?<eos> I know.<eos> All right.<eos> - You ready? - Yeah.<eos> - Hey. I got you guys a plant.
Iris, trying to show that you're not afraid?<eos> But I know you are.<eos> I'm sorry that you have to die.<eos> But it's you or me.<eos> And despite your feeble efforts to change the future, you can't, because I am the future, Flash.
I've never felt this much harmonic feedback.<eos> It feels like the Speed Force is about to... ♪ ♪<eos> - Wally! - Barry!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Are you okay?
It's good of you to join the party, Kid Flash.<eos> I'm happy to have you.<eos> What do you want with Supergirl?<eos> Same thing that I want with both of you.<eos> To teach you all a lesson.
The what of the what?<eos> What the hell you talking about, kid?<eos> My name's Cutter Moran, I own this club, and both of you work for me.<eos> We what now?<eos> I pay you to sing, not pepper me with questions.
And, you, all those rainy nights watching Fred Astaire and Frank Sinatra with Mom.<eos> Well, where else would we be?<eos> All right, all right.<eos> Whoo! Ooh! Swing and a miss.<eos> I didn't tell you. I'm not really here.
- Millie.<eos> - Millie, right.<eos> Yeah, she's in there, all right.<eos> Now, you two listen to me.<eos> Don't you go telling anyone I showed you this.
Now, you two listen to me.<eos> Don't you go telling anyone I showed you this.<eos> Oh, yeah, we promise.<eos> Word to the wise.<eos> You go digging around in this dirt... you might not like what you find.
No, I'm sorry... what's going on?<eos> Why did you do this to us?<eos> I did it because I believe in the good guys.<eos> I told you when we first met.<eos> It was to teach all of you a lesson.
I thought that maybe we could make it a double if you guys were interested?<eos> Uh, yeah, we're interested.<eos> When? First weekend in July.<eos> Um, July.<eos> Y... does that not work for you guys?
Showed up on my Earth a few years back, did a string of robberies that ended with a lot of people losing their lives.<eos> Showed up again a couple weeks ago, looted some tech companies, came here.<eos> To do the same thing?<eos> Why? He must have needed our Earth's tech for something.<eos> Well, whatever it is, we can definitely help you figure it out, 'cause I don't know about you guys, but ever since last time you were here, I've been looking forward to some Gypsy vibe action.
Iris's death shouldn't have driven me away from you all.<eos> I mean...<eos> I mean, it should've driven me closer.<eos> This isn't what she would want.<eos> But I'm here now to tell you that... no matter what happens in the past, I will not abandon you.
You... you told me that it was because Barry didn't like the noise from the street.<eos> Yeah, no.<eos> But in my defense, my curfew was 8:00 p.m.<eos> - Yeah, I was a little strict.<eos> Okay, since... since we're confessing, remember... when I told you guys that we couldn't eat out for a month, because I was saving money for yours and Barry's college tuition?
Barry.<eos> A hero among heroes.<eos> You're all heroes. And you've all given me so... so much, you know?<eos> You've given me a home, you've given me a purpose.<eos> Now you've led me to the woman that I adore, that I wanna spend my future with, and through it all, what have I done?
Look, I am partially responsible for the damage she inflicts on the world.<eos> If I want to make good, that starts with killing Sybil.<eos> I'm just having a hard time taking you seriously because of everything you've done.<eos> You don't have to trust me.<eos> But I sure as hell am trusting you.
Don't worry.<eos> As long as I get what I want, I'll make sure they behave.<eos> It should look effortless, ladies.<eos> And don't forget to smile.<eos> But not because society says you have to, but because you're happy to be at such an illustrious town event.
So who won?<eos> Um... it's a six-way tie.<eos> Now, go home. No.<eos> No, we have to stay.<eos> Who told you you have to stay?
You were in hell?<eos> Yeah, you killed me.<eos> I think I'm on the wait list for heaven, but they're not returning my calls.<eos> You said you had a better idea than killing Cade with this dagger.<eos> Find a way to get me out of hell, all the way, and then I'll help you kill Cade.
You have to be careful.<eos> And these dresses are not play clothes.<eos> We're practicing.<eos> For the wedding.<eos> Look, I know you girls are excited about the wedding, and wearing these dresses, and all of it, but it might not be as soon as Mommy promised.
I need Stefan just as much as she needed you.<eos> And Lizzie and Josie need him, too.<eos> Enough about Stefan already.<eos> What you guys need is someone who can explain to you what's going on with your Gemini coven twins.<eos> I feel like there's someone around here who could help you with that, but I just can't quite put my finger on it.
Anything is better than endless torture in hell.<eos> And all I had to do was keep you idiots distracted until the fire started.<eos> What is Katherine planning?<eos> You don't have to bully me.<eos> She wanted me to let you know.
I'm not the one who's gonna get out of here, Damon.<eos> You are.<eos> Bad time to be a martyr, Stefan.<eos> Said the martyr.<eos> I'm gonna let you two figure this out amongst yourselves.
But you American hunters, you're -- you're a different breed than our sort.<eos> You're surly, suspicious.<eos> You don't play well with others.<eos> Well, that is accurate.<eos> You don't trust people you don't know, even when they come bearing gifts.
This the man in charge? That's right.<eos> Well, let me tell you how this is gonna go.<eos> You're gonna call your boys and you're gonna turn around, and nobody's gonna get hurt. No, no.<eos> Here's how this is gonna go.<eos> I take my highly trained soldiers, track your ass down, and you get hurt.
I love you.<eos> Cass, what have you done?<eos> What had to be done.<eos> You know this world, this sad, doomed little world, it needs you.<eos> It needs every last Winchester it can get, and I will not let you die.
Obviously.<eos> They killed my friend.<eos> Your friend was stupid. You're all...<eos> Do you know what you've done?<eos> Does the name Ramiel mean anything to you?
Right.<eos> Hello, Winchester.<eos> Ketch?<eos> Where's Mick?<eos> He didn't tell you?
After all the... Unpleasantness with dagon and renny, well...<eos> Mick has a lot to answer for.<eos> So for the time being, you'll report to me.<eos> Seriously?<eos> I don't like it any more than you do.
And if you find her again?<eos> Sam's working on it.<eos> Of course, he's hell-bent on finding something that doesn't mean killing her or her kid.<eos> Right. And if he doesn't find something?<eos> If you run out of time, could either of you kill an innocent?
Mummy always was a talented hunter.<eos> Just somewhat... Confused about obeying orders.<eos> What did you do to her?<eos> Lady Bevell cleared up that... Confusion.<eos> And I suspect she told you that the American hunters are a dying breed.
So why are you here?<eos> Well, whenever there's a world-ending crisis at hand,<eos> I know where to place my bets.<eos> It's on you, you big, beautiful, lumbering piles of flannel.<eos> So if you'll forgive my transgression, I'll make it worth your while.
Don't worry.<eos> It will be fine.<eos> Remember -- paradise,.<eos> Well... this is a fun surprise. ♪<eos> I gotta hand it to you guys.
What address did you take him to?<eos> Top of the hill in Lyme, a street on the right. He directed me.<eos> But you'd be able to take us back to that street if we asked you?<eos> Who's Maria Brady?<eos> Did Angela tell you about that?
So I got dropped off back there.<eos> Walked in this way.<eos> - Can I...<eos> - Whatever you want. We'll be led by you.<eos> Did she tell you about the flowers? No.
Poor Trish.<eos> - How do you know it was her?<eos> - Mate, it's all round the town.<eos> At least they kept her name out the papers.<eos> Hard for you and your wife.
Brought through on your recommendation.<eos> - Oh, God. So this is my fault?<eos> - Never crossed my mind, ma'am.<eos> If it's any consolation, I think she was just stupid, not bent. OK.<eos> If I were you, and... I'm not in any official capacity saying that you should do this... Do the Gold Meeting.
I don't know!<eos> I live behind the shop.<eos> It takes me 50 steps to get to work.<eos> The shop is my life.<eos> I wish I could make you understand, that I would never hurt Trish.
Jim Atwood was wandering the grounds, sexually frustrated, with a pack of condoms in his pocket, around the time that Trish was raped.<eos> And he's still the only suspect who's ever come up with a DNA match on Trish, even if it was from when they slept together that morning.<eos> Vice is tightening, Miller. Right around Jim Atwood.<eos> - Hello? - Yeah.<eos> I'm calling to tell you who installed spyware on the computer.
This is for Alfred, you must save your sword for Kjartan.<eos> If it is for Alfred... I will go with you.<eos> And me!<eos> It was my bastard plan.<eos> And I shall wish you all the best of luck.
Latin and legal.<eos> "In loco parentis" means "acting in the role of a parent."<eos> It is a legal term and it applies to Count Olaf.<eos> The actor is acting as your parent. And as your legal guardian, Count Olaf may raise you using any method he sees fit.<eos> So I'm sorry if your parents didn't make you do household chores, or if you like their friends more than you like Count Olaf's friends.
Who needs an assistant when I have three charming Baudelaire bambinis to help me with my research?<eos> Bambini?<eos> Bambini. It's Italian for "children."<eos> Why, I'm so giddy having you here that I might as well be talking gibberish.<eos> Now, Baudelaires, I am about to show you one of the most important scientific collections in the history of the world.
- I told you we couldn't trust him. - You're laughing?<eos> I'm terribly sorry, children.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> But the incredibly deadly viper is one of the friendliest and least dangerous animals in the entire animal kingdom.<eos> It will come to no harm and neither will you.
my scientific library.<eos> The deepest secrets of the snake world can be found in these pages.<eos> And I hope that you'll find them.<eos> So we're allowed to read all these books?<eos> You are not only allowed, you are implored to read these books.
- Monty!<eos> - You're here.<eos> Hello, children.<eos> It's been a long night and we have a very busy day tomorrow.<eos> - Did you enjoy the movie?
Who were we supposed to meet there?<eos> I know you children have a great many questions, and I promise there are a great many answers.<eos> Find your Aunt Josephine.<eos> She's a fierce and formidable woman.<eos> She can keep you safe and tell you everything you need to know.
She was murdered. In cold blood.<eos> Her killer made it look like suicide.<eos> Murdered? Hildur was murdered?<eos> So who murdered her?<eos> I'll show you.
No. I get it, Terence.<eos> Okay, got to call him back.<eos> Shut up, Cathy. You're an idiot.<eos> I said no.<eos> Morning, you two.
You are in, but in an outside kind of way.<eos> For how much longer?<eos> How's Reggie?<eos> I don't like keeping secrets from him or Maddie, or Harry Bosch, for that matter.<eos> Look, Jay, I got you what you wanted.
Apparently they forgot what century we live in.<eos> Yeah. It's okay.<eos> I'm glad you came.<eos> I'm sorry about this.<eos> Let me get you guys a drink.
We gotta get guns.<eos> - Get the door! - Get off!<eos> Get off me.<eos> - Stay down!<eos> - No. I'm telling you... It's coming!
It's great.<eos> Kaylee loves her new school.<eos> The neighborhood's friendly. We feel safe.<eos> That's good.<eos> Mike, I don't know how to thank you.
This is not family court.<eos> We're not here to re-litigate the witness' divorce.<eos> I can't see what purpose this serves.<eos> I can.<eos> I'll tell you why my brother brought my ex-wife to this hearing.
"Toe-in-the-Water" package. That's, uh, one commercial, flat rate,<eos> $849.95.<eos> Beauty part again... free airtime.<eos> And when this thing runs, you're gonna get calls...<eos> I can promise you that.
How've you been?<eos> Fantastic.<eos> Thank you.<eos> All's well with the expansion?<eos> I saw you got that branch approved on your original timeline, after all.
Ew.<eos> How are you doing that?<eos> It's so easy.<eos> I'll show you.
Document's undergoing a restoration effort by historians at the Middlesex Museum in London.<eos> Draw up a plan.<eos> And remember, the chances of getting Anna Copeland and her son out alive drop with every hour.<eos> I just want to be clear...<eos> I'll help you find Bray, but after that, I'm... I'm done.
Justice.<eos> I loved her once.<eos> In some ways, I still do.<eos> I know how difficult this is, but it's the right thing to do.<eos> I want to thank you for helping me do it.
Harold Cooper, Deputy Director FBI.<eos> - The answer is no.<eos> - What's the question?<eos> You're obviously here because of Tom.<eos> He told you I was being held.
I got this.<eos> Hey!<eos> Get your ass back here!<eos> Shooting Russian agents on Russian soil is an act of war.<eos> - I'm telling you, he's playing us.
For a rainy day.<eos> _<eos> Gonna deactivate the alarm system with what'll look like a routine software update.<eos> No red flags.<eos> Buys you ten minutes.
That's slightly suspicious, no?<eos> Are you living mannequins suggesting i had something to do with my brother's death?<eos> We're just curious.<eos> What do the police think happened?<eos> I'll tell you what i told them, which is that jason did fall into the water.
Chuck has muscles for days, but his conversation is not the stuff of Oscar Wilde, or even Diablo Cody.<eos> Hey, Veronica. How was the Sticky Maple you had last night?<eos> - The what now?<eos> - The Sticky Maple Chuck gave you?<eos> How was it? We had a brownie sundae, if that's what you hyenas mean.
She... Okay, she is depressed and delusional.<eos> Did you actually believe the story she told you?<eos> About running off to Never-Never Land and raising a family?<eos> That's a fantasy, Betty.<eos> - I don't believe you.
I don't have it.<eos> Maybe Hugh Meachum has it.<eos> He works in this building, doesn't he?<eos> Mr. Meachum is recently retired.<eos> And what does Mr. Swagger get if he gives it to you?
He's been better, honestly.<eos> He's... The years are... Are catching up to him.<eos> Catching up to all of us.<eos> Well, you tell him I said "hello."<eos> Tell him, as much as I appreciate the three of you, I wouldn't mind being across from him doing business.
Catching up to all of us.<eos> Well, you tell him I said "hello."<eos> Tell him, as much as I appreciate the three of you, I wouldn't mind being across from him doing business.<eos> - Well, thank you. - Yeah.<eos> So... I wish I had something different to tell you.
There are about five buyers, and you all control the market.<eos> You know what?<eos> And every year, it's about how you all can get more for less.<eos> JD, we've been doing business for a long time.<eos> So I'm gonna put some numbers in front of you, and if you can hit the numbers, great.
And every year, it's about how you all can get more for less.<eos> JD, we've been doing business for a long time.<eos> So I'm gonna put some numbers in front of you, and if you can hit the numbers, great.<eos> We can keep doing business.<eos> But if you can't hit the numbers, then all I can tell you is I've got guys up in Bentonville, and they're running their PL's, and that's generally all they care about.
No.<eos> I'm sorry, I had to ask.<eos> I'm sorry to interrupt your, um...<eos> - Kung Pao chicken. - Yeah.<eos> But I just wanted to let you both know that we're gonna take care of this.
- I ain't your friend.<eos> I don't want to fight.<eos> Just leave him alone, okay?<eos> - You protecting' him?<eos> - He ain't done nothin' to you.
I didn't hear anything to support the idea that he killed a person.<eos> It's a process.<eos> Takes time, Sheriff.<eos> Yeah, we've got enough to charge him.<eos> I'm sorry. I mean, he's sitting there telling you he didn't kill nobody.
Come on. There it is.<eos> How 'bout coffee?<eos> - Why not?<eos> - Okay.<eos> Anything else I can get you boys?
Do you hear me? !<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Do you want to play, sir?<eos> We're missing aa goalie.<eos> Do I look like a goalie to you?
Step back, ma'am.<eos> Yeah, I'm with Homeland.<eos> This is my house.<eos> What is this? I work for Homeland!<eos> Who ordered you to search my house?
I think they were dropping her off at Chris's mother's, with the baby.<eos> It's in town somewhere.<eos> You were seen, Mr Jessop, mooching around backstage at the Almanac show.<eos> You had the perfect opportunity to leave those poisoned chocolates.<eos> Who told you that?
They have trained staff who look after them, 24 hours a day, but they're free. To live as near a normal life as they can.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> I don't like the look of it.<eos> Why don't you both just think about it?<eos> There's no rush. We just wanted you to know that there were places like that.
Yeah, things went wrong...<eos> But, listen, we're more interested in what Phillip told you.<eos> What's his version?<eos> I wasn't there.<eos> I can only tell you what he said.
I guess so.<eos> Who shot him?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Look. When I got to the fifth floor all I saw were dead guards and I heard gun shots, so I hid.<eos> I can't tell you who killed him.
I was lucky to make it out alive.<eos> Did you see Phillip die?<eos> Not exactly, they fell through the window, so I assume he did, and then when the SWAT team got there, I heard them say they were all dead.<eos> Well, Suzanne, we couldn't find his body.<eos> Well, I don't know what to tell you, I told you everything I saw.
Not hiding.<eos> Still just the driver.<eos> - Same driver?<eos> - Couldn't see.<eos> This kid- - I'm telling you, he's not doing good.
I know what Cersei has told you.<eos> That I've come to destroy your cities, burn down your homes, murder you, and orphan your children.<eos> That's Cersei Lannister, not me.<eos> I'm not here to murder, and all I want to destroy is the wheel that has rolled over rich and poor to the benefit of no one but the Cersei Lannisters of the world.<eos> I offer you a choice... bend the knee and join me.
Same shit, different shovel, every day. Teenage daughter.<eos> Ex in Hong Kong someplace, I think.<eos> They talk about that shit all the time.<eos> It's boring fucking shit.<eos> I'm telling you, this guy is not a problem.
Is it cutting into your surf time?<eos> As a matter of fact it is.<eos> A little longer.<eos> We gotta know what he knows.<eos> I'm telling you, this guy has no ties to us.
Mark, you know, was fired from the department, and... we're gonna say he killed himself.<eos> Yeah, I don't like it, but it... makes sense, I guess.<eos> And it clears Megan. So...<eos> No fucking way.<eos> Megan! I won't have you disgrace Mark's memory by saying he abandoned his family.
I'm sending in a black and white.<eos> Medic 274 responding.<eos> Well, about time, Williams.<eos> Where have you been?<eos> Do you need assistance?
Why did you do all this?<eos> It was a debt.<eos> When I was in jail, some guy offered me and my buddy Taylor protection.<eos> When we got out, said we owed him.<eos> He told you to kill somebody for him?
I mean, not just the sex, which was always good. Okay.<eos> Um, so anyway, uh, a while back, I had this dumb dream of having a boat.<eos> I never thought in a million years he'd remember something like that, but he did.<eos> And so now he wants to buy one for me and the kids.<eos> He wants to buy you a boat?
I mean, you know, I could be a little bit proud - and, uh...<eos> - Sure.<eos> stubborn.<eos> I wonder where I get that from.<eos> So it sounds like, uh, ahem, sounds like you guys are working things out.
I'm saying you're gonna need to change your plans here.<eos> All due respect, Ms. Whelan, the Chief of Staff doesn't make these decisions. The President does.<eos> With all due respect, Ms. Webster, I speak for the President.<eos> Right here, right now, I am the President.<eos> And I'm telling you this isn't a death penalty case anymore.
But believe me when I say our defining moment is near.<eos> This job is not your garden variety snatch and grab.<eos> Our target is a young man named Holden Matthews.<eos> A Google search will tell you he was in a 12-year coma.<eos> It will not tell you how dangerous he is.
Can you...<eos> I got to go.<eos> Fuck. Fuck.<eos> You were in there a while, Eddie.<eos> I don't know how many times I got to tell you guys.
It's so beautiful. It sounds so cool.<eos> When I grow up, I wanna be you.<eos> Well, while I was out there on the road, I got to listen to your record a lot, And I was very inspired.<eos> So let's talk about where we're headed.<eos> We are trying to find you guys another tour.
Hey. Gunnar.<eos> Loved the single.<eos> Randall's just come on to help us. With our marketing and social media.<eos> And I was just talking to them. About the music video idea.<eos> Yes. With video, people do the marketing for you, right?
They post it on facebook.<eos> But it has to be distinctive.<eos> It has to just grab the people. Like what?<eos> Stop by my cubicle. When you're all done, all right?<eos> And I'll show you some cool stuff.
You were amazing.<eos> And as for you...<eos> Maybe a bag of ice?<eos> Let me go one better.<eos> Can I stand you both to a Tennessee Whiskey?
And even if it was white, gospel music?<eos> I mean, isn't your thing a little sexier than that?<eos> Oh, yeah, I'm looking real sexy right about now.<eos> - So you're gonna pay us?<eos> - Of course, I'll pay you.
You're the one who brought up business.<eos> You don't see me twisting your arm to be a part of this.<eos> I see you coming in here telling us what we're gonna do.<eos> Oh, don't give me that!<eos> I'm not telling you anything.
You guys have dropped<eos> - a terrific new music video.<eos> - Sure have.<eos> - It's called "All of Me." - "All of Me."<eos> And can I tell you something?
Thank you.<eos> I mean it.<eos> I know work is the last thing anyone wants to talk about right now.<eos> But, um, here's where we are.<eos> We have found a great tour for you guys.
Well, all right then.<eos> You can see it for yourself, Alicia, this crowd is so ready for the final two nights of Music City's Music Week.<eos> We got Dierk's Bentley, Little Big Town,<eos> Chris Stapleton, The Exes, and of course, the first live performance by Juliette Barnes since that plane crash earlier this year.<eos> Aside from bringing you a new artist, I was thinking about big media integration... Uh, Deacon!
I'd like to introduce you all to the new interim Chief Strategy Officer for Highway 65, Alyssa Greene.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey, everyone.<eos> I am a big believer in radical honesty.<eos> So I'm just gonna tell you right now that I have never worked in the music business.
Well, he was sponsored by Red Bull.<eos> If we do this right, you can find the resources you need to allow yourselves to grow as artists.<eos> And still do it on your own terms.<eos> And make the companies paying for this happy?<eos> I'm telling you it is possible.
That part's irrelevant.<eos> Look, I just don't wanna feel like I'm some sort of middle man...<eos> No, I get it, I get it.<eos> I do, and I'm sorry.<eos> But, you know, for the record, I am just trying to help all you guys succeed.
Hey. Sorry.<eos> Am I interrupting?<eos> - No, not at all. - Oh, hey!<eos> I asked Maddie to pop in. Because I kind of got a crazy idea on my run this morning.<eos> And I wanted to pitch it to both of you.
- Talk to you later.<eos> Oh, my God, it's been so long.<eos> How are you?<eos> How is the baby?<eos> I got to tell you guys something.
Okay.<eos> You can go.<eos> All right, I gotta get going myself.<eos> Oh, listen...<eos> I wanted to run something by you guys.
We combine like terms.<eos> After that, your job is to isolate "x"<eos> Gunnar, you need to report to the principal's office.<eos> Beyond awful, boys.<eos> I'm so sorry to have to give you this news.
Yeah, no question.<eos> This could be any one of us.<eos> - That's going too far.<eos> - I hear you both.<eos> But I feel like it's my job to let you know where this whole thing's gonna go if we do decide to stand firm.
Previously on "Colony"...<eos> You have been assigned to one of the Authority's labor camps and distribution centers.<eos> What is this?<eos> Who ordered you to search my house?
So why'd you have the affair?<eos> I mean, you had everything.<eos> You're, like, out of armpit Pennsylvania and you go straight into some fancy college and meet a hot chick.<eos> She's rich.<eos> Her daddy buys you a house.
- A panic room.<eos> - What?<eos> - Get in.<eos> My God.<eos> What do you need a panic room for?
People to whom the vast fortunes of this great nation never trickle down.<eos> We were told this job wasn't for one of us.<eos> Well, America, here we are!<eos> IYa llegamos!<eos> Thank you for thinking differently.
Hello, Philadelphia!<eos> I want to thank you for thinking differently.
Then I will give you instructions on what you're going to do next.<eos> Give me instructions?<eos> About what?<eos> Hello?<eos> I want to thank you for thinking differently.
I'm here to make a deal.<eos> You're not in the strongest deal-making position right now, Ms. Whelan.<eos> It's stronger than you think.<eos> I have something you want... Information you need.<eos> I'll give it to you, and I assure you it will be worth it.
We'll give them a goddamn war.<eos> Oh, I could use one of these.<eos> Guarding the docks on ceres.<eos> I don't think the martians will give you one.<eos> They didn't give you one either.
Jerry's got the Black Friday Blues.<eos> Black Friday.<eos> Is that, that still a thing?<eos> Yes, it is, and mine just got spoiled by a fed with a phone.<eos> Probably find whatever you need here.
Cuff yourself to the door handle.<eos> - You're making a mistake. - Wouldn't be my first.<eos> You mind if I use my own cuffs?<eos> They're in my pocket next to the badge, in case you wanna look.<eos> Business you're in, figure you can tell that's not a fake.
Even for a few days?<eos> Be patient, Joel.<eos> Don't waste your time on this one.<eos> It's Bosch.<eos> He'll give you just cause soon enough.
And I'm sure whoever sent it to Scott Anderson is planning on just that.<eos> That would be the right play.<eos> How do you see this thing going?<eos> You squeeze Jesse to get to Rudy.<eos> Rudy gives you Holland.
Slams shut, stays shut.<eos> Quit trying to play me.<eos> I know the game.<eos> You want your phone call?<eos> I'll let you know.
Fine. Just do exactly as I say, okay?<eos> - Hmm? - Okay.<eos> What?<eos> [gun cocks] [chuckles] Damn, we're good.<eos> [handcuffs clicking] I'm telling you, I don't know anything about it.
CONRAD: All units, pharmacy robbery in Lakeview.<eos> Suspect headed southbound on Lincoln between 8th and 9th.<eos> MURPHY: 1099. 1309 responding.<eos> How are those bikes coming?<eos> PETE: Officers, I can't let you do this.
You have no ID. Snap!<eos> Get in the fucking position.<eos> Go!<eos> That's right, motherfucker.<eos> Let me tell you something about getting into this fraternity.
Yo, Cee.<eos> How is that better than basketball?<eos> Hey, don't throw up on my fucking floor, boy.<eos> Hey, ain't nobody say y'all Niggas get out of your line.<eos> About to teach you mutts a lesson.
- You a nasty motherfucker.<eos> - Line up, line up, line up!<eos> I want you all to hear this.<eos> Don't forget you all been touched.<eos> You are following in the footsteps of the most prestigious black men in American history, and thus far, you've done good work.
If she's as good as her word, and one thing she certainly wasn't was a liar, then her book of Battle Magic will be found here.<eos> - In this room.<eos> - Why?<eos> She told me. "The Battle Magic will be "where the knowledge always is.<eos> "The day you need it, I promise, it will be your last hope."
And right inside the lines of marriage.<eos> We just do what we do in bed, and they do what they do.<eos> I only picked people already doing each other.<eos> And we get to watch.<eos> You guys are all cool with this, right? - Mm-hmm.
- What's going to happen to them now?<eos> Your heart bleeds the way only a vagina should.<eos> Get a picture!<eos> We love you, Flaritza!<eos> We saw what they did to you!
We're together.<eos> - You can write letters. - No. Letters?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> No, where are we going?<eos> You think they're gonna let any of you back in there after all this?
When would he have been exposed to radiation?<eos> That's exactly my question.<eos> Have you been trying to build some sort of dirty bomb?<eos> No. Of course not.<eos> Well, whatever it is you've been working on, I suggest you stop, before you all end up like him.
He was sitting with that woman... Frankie Brun.<eos> We cross-indexed her face and discovered that she also met with a bomber who detonated himself in our lobby.<eos> That girl is our way into the cell.<eos> Squeeze her family and friends.<eos> Hopefully you can produce something.
My fellow citizens, we all saw something... remarkable last night.<eos> Now, I know that there are a lot of rumors going around our bloc.<eos> What you witnessed... was the test of a technology that you have never seen before, one capable of inter-dimensional travel.<eos> All in preparation for the Greatest Day.<eos> I understand the hardships that all of you...
Will found a kid hiding inside, helped him escape.<eos> But now they're out looking for the kid.<eos> All right, so let me get this right.<eos> You sabotage our operation with the the RAP and quit the group, yet when you need help, we're supposed to pretend it didn't happen?<eos> I am the reason you escaped the Occupation.
But now they're out looking for the kid.<eos> All right, so let me get this right.<eos> You sabotage our operation with the the RAP and quit the group, yet when you need help, we're supposed to pretend it didn't happen?<eos> I am the reason you escaped the Occupation.<eos> And I helped you with BB.
You can save them.<eos> Just lead us to Broussard.<eos> I can't.<eos> He doesn't trust me.<eos> But I can give you something you need almost as much as Broussard.
Yes, please.<eos> Go! Go, go, go!<eos> I gotta get the taste out.<eos> My Lord.<eos> What the heck you folks get into out there?
First time it's for the girls.<eos> And if they come back, it's for one girl in particular.<eos> He fell in love?<eos> With who?<eos> I told you what I was gonna tell you, now get the hell out of here.
What?<eos> Tycho t.C. Refuses to release the clamps until Fred Johnson gives his personal authorization.<eos> And he's not.<eos> All right, I'm on it.<eos> I don't have to let you leave, you know.
Wouldn't bet on her in a race, though.<eos> Have any of you been to Ganymede recently?<eos> No.<eos> Never. The station is a mess.<eos> If you tell us what you're doing there and what you want,
Close.<eos> One of the few things not in dispute is that the battle on Ganymede began on the ground.<eos> But per your request, we have brought in the lone survivor of the surface engagement.<eos> This is Marine Gunnery Sergeant Roberta Draper.<eos> She will be giving you her account of the battle.
Doctor what?<eos> Time!<eos> Time doesn't pass.<eos> The passage of time is an illusion, and life is the magician.<eos> Because life only lets you see one day at a time.
My Dad and my brother went ahead of me.<eos> Where I come from, that's just what you did.<eos> Your home is here now, Martin Tillman.<eos> Leave the past behind.<eos> It was a shame as I told you last night, you fucked a penguin.
I... A little help out here, maybe, with Diana.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I think you just...<eos> I think you need to see it.<eos> Do you like it?
And you want nick burkhardt dead. That's it.<eos> There you go.<eos> Monroe.<eos> Hank, back here.<eos> I told you to give me your resignation. I gave you my damn resignation!
- All three of them.<eos> - I don't do this because I want to. I have to.<eos> What, do you get a headache if you don't? - And these visions tell you to do what?<eos> Stop the evil.<eos> You grimms think you know El cuegle, but you don't.
I've seen this face before.<eos> - I think I know this guy. - How could you know him if he's only above ground for one day every seven years?<eos> No, it was more recent than that.<eos> Then it can't be the same guy.<eos> No, I'm telling you, it's the same guy.
Gotta live for the moment.<eos> Did you carve all that stuff in the tunnel?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> I think so.<eos> I should have told you guys I was down there.
You... you... you don't understand, it'll kill me!<eos> No-no-no, no, no-no-no-no.<eos> No, he'll come for me!<eos> He'll come for you!<eos> He won't let you sleep!
They do have security cameras, all focused on the parking lot.<eos> They're putting it together.<eos> Okay, got a connect on her last caller, Dr. Sanji Raju, also on the university staff.<eos> Gonna need address and phone.<eos> Yeah, texting it to you now.
Dev shoot this deer last night?<eos> Maybe, I...<eos> I don't know that's...<eos> I didn't see... Look, that's not what<eos> - I'm trying to tell you. - Oh, so nobody ever informed you that hunting at night with a spotlight is poaching.
Do you have that list of them?<eos> - Not on me.<eos> - Well, you wanna get it?<eos> Of course.<eos> Allow me to tell you where they went missing.
We just got back from the M.E.'s.<eos> We got a dead body full of an enzyme called hyaluronidase.<eos> It's something found in bug saliva.<eos> Hoping you might know of a Wesen that uses it to kill its victims.<eos> Did we catch you at a bad time?
Yeah.<eos> I can't believe it.<eos> Trubel showed up after.<eos> I sent her to the cabin.<eos> - What do you need my blood for?
Come back and fight!<eos> God damn you!<eos> - You alone?<eos> - Yeah, but Nick and Eve should be pretty close behind us.<eos> He tell you about Hank and Wu?
- Can you be there and back in time?<eos> - If we leave now.<eos> If you're late, we cannot wait for you.<eos> Of course.<eos> You mustn't miss the hour.
- Lives the other side of Truro.<eos> - Take time to summon him.<eos> - Let him be summoned.<eos> Demelza and I regret we have chores to attend to.<eos> Let me show you to your room.
Did you hear about the goings in St Ann's?<eos> Another corn ship raided, two young tackers shot.<eos> Unwin assures me it's only a matter of time before Dr Enys will be released.<eos> And in the meantime, he receives the best possible treatment.<eos> Did I not order you to rest, Lieutenant Armitage?
Who can guess at his motives!<eos> His uncle and I cannot abide each other.<eos> Our ways of doing business are wholly at odds.<eos> But I have a certain fondness for the nephew.<eos> So I trust you'll forgive me for inflicting him upon you!
Will 'ee not take a stand with us, brother?<eos> Will 'ee not show where thy loyalties lie?<eos> You know where this leads, Tholly.<eos> Bloodshed, riot. We've both seen it.<eos> So go now and no harm will come to you.
- The roommate was moving.<eos> My client grabbed the only weapon in the vicinity to protect his life.<eos> We also have this receipt from an online hardware store for a box cutter exactly like that one delivered to Dean's home address.<eos> Looks like intent to me.<eos> So before the DNA evidence comes back, I'll give you two options that will let us settle this mess today, but they're dependant on establishing. Mr. Lewis did not personally exploit any children.
Heroin, rock cocaine, lemon juice, mineral water.<eos> Tap water these days? Who knows what's in it?<eos> You know what I mean? I know what you're doing.<eos> What? Have you done this before?<eos> No. You want me to change my mind about helping you, and I'm not going to.
Then you're even less prepared to be a leader than I thought, because your partner's out there coming after my firm, and you don't even know it!<eos> Maybe Louis wouldn't be doing that if you hadn't come here with some bullshit merger designed to rip us apart.<eos> Are you really that stupid?<eos> Are you really telling me that isn't what you wanted?<eos> If I wanted to rip you apart, you'd be in million pieces right now, because Jessica is gone, and you're not in my league.
Everybody listen up.<eos> You have a new supervisor starting today.<eos> His name is Mike Ross.<eos> Mike is from Pearson Specter Litt, and he knows more about law than all of you combined.<eos> So, if Mike tells you to do something, you do it.
Now, I'm about to show you some very sensitive information.
Did I use that word right?<eos> Eleanor Shellstrop.<eos> Hi, everyone, I'm Eleanor.<eos> Original flavor, not new and improved.<eos> I know a lot of bad stuff has happened because of me, but I never meant to hurt you, so if I caused you any harm, I'm truly sorry.
Oh, I know you've only worked here a few weeks, but we have this little office tradition where we all pitch in, and then we...<eos> Yeah, no, I get it.<eos> It's just, I know what kind of cake I like.<eos> Plus, it's Lisa's birthday next week, and if I let you give me a cake, that means I gotta pitch in to get Lisa a cake and sing to her and wear one of those dumb hats you all are wearing right now. No, thanks.<eos> This way, I don't owe you anything, you don't owe me anything.
Trying to blow up the train.<eos> Blowing stuff up got me out of so many jams on Earth.<eos> Let me try again.<eos> Do... do you have another bottle?<eos> Hi there, since there's no Janet here to serve you, I brought you two a little treat.
And you blew the other half trying to frame her boyfriend.<eos> It was so stupid.<eos> He was already guilty, dumbass.<eos> I've been on my own for a while now anyway, and after you sign these papers, it'll be official.<eos> I won't owe you anything; you won't owe me anything.
The time has come to innovate.<eos> The human afterlife can be more fun.<eos> For us, obviously, not for the people we're torturing.<eos> Who cares about those dummies?<eos> I present to you the perfect recipe for my proposed experiment.
You thought we would torture each other, and we did for a little, but we also took care of each other.<eos> We improved each other, and the four of us became a team.<eos> So, the only thing you succeeded in doing was bringing us all together.<eos> Oh, Eleanor. That's it!<eos> My big mistake was bringing you all together, having you be soul mates living next to each other.
Or better yet, make me stop thinking at all. Stop!<eos> Stop!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> !<eos> I command you, leave at once!
Pay phones?<eos> Aren't pay phones a thing of the past?<eos> All due respect, my son is misremembering the night.<eos> And Danny handing you his cell and you walking around the outside of the Harbor Grill pretending to try to make a phone call... is your son misremembering all that, too?<eos> Danny... told you he gave me his cell?
Got another three weeks to go.<eos> I'm-a no kill myself.<eos> I'm-a never die, not on a bicycle.<eos> That is a sure thing.<eos> HAMM: And JuJu didn't die that day, but he did eventually, as you know, because we showed it to you at the beginning.
Approach with caution, and be prepared to use necessary force, but suspect must be taken alive.<eos> Zero, Roger, wait out.<eos> As-salamu 'alaykum.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - Means "peace be upon you."
You said you wanna come on guys?<eos> That's it. I'm getting off.<eos> You said you're getting off.<eos> All right. Listen, you sons of bitches.<eos> I'll find your parents and make you wish you never messed with the king of Hollywood.
I'm in.<eos> Okay, Rachel's gone.<eos> I don't want any bullshit. You're telling me that no matter what we do,<eos> Rachel's getting into the Bar?<eos> What I'm telling you is if she doesn't get in, that asshole isn't gonna be the one that stopped her.
Those baggies are not mine.<eos> They're covered in chocolate fingerprints.<eos> Check out your hands.<eos> Yes, do give me a second.<eos> I can explain you?
This is an outrage, captain, truly.<eos> Is it?<eos> Lieutenant, we have what we need.<eos> Well, gentlemen, We have confirmed your statement.<eos> And the state of california thanks you for you cooperation.
I handled that shit.<eos> So what's the guy who stabbed Shin doing here if Milan's out of the picture?<eos> I'm still working with Petar and the rest of the Serbs.<eos> But Julio is the distro now.<eos> He'll keep you in weight, like I always did.
Well, thanks for waiting and not just, you know, killing him.<eos> We're only monsters by necessity, Joshua.<eos> Besides, we just ate.<eos> Oh, that's too bad.<eos> I was gonna offer you some "welcome back" waffles.
Hey, I was just gonna order a pizza. You know, if we're gonna be here for a while.<eos> Fabulous.<eos> Yes, I still do have... a murderous hunger.<eos> Okay.<eos> Why do you guys even need me?
Who is that?<eos> It's Kenny Rixton.<eos> He's Ruzek's replacement.<eos> - What? - Ruzek's replacement.<eos> Look, I'll fill you in later.
- Well, like I said, she was loyal to a fault.<eos> - Hi, I'm Lara Michaels.<eos> - This is my wife.<eos> I'm the CEO of this company, and, as I'm sure Kirby told you, Zoey was one of our most cherished employees.<eos> So we want to help you in any way possible.
Tonya's getting charged and DCFS is gonna shut Brady down.<eos> Everybody there's gonna get an alternate placement.<eos> We found a really good family for you in Libertyville, the Melnicks.<eos> They're coming here to pick you up.<eos> Hey, I'll give you a minute.
They sleep rough, forage, go hungry.<eos> An army marches on its stomach!<eos> Bishop!<eos> Here I am.<eos> Have I not helped you gain power, and keep it?
Remind me, who's this man?<eos> Father Pascal, Sire, Confessor to Her Majesty, the Queen.<eos> I wish never to see him again!<eos> What sort of help?<eos> That sort that enables you to continue your trade.
Don't look at him, look at me.<eos> He killed the Bretts, Niko.<eos> He didn't tell you, did he?<eos> He hasn't told you he's gonna kill the boy, too.<eos> Just as soon as we give you the money.
That is... so sad. And that's why I moved into tech.<eos> And now, I sue people like you.<eos> ♪ ♪ What?<eos> So, he's a patent troll?<eos> Yep, as like in buy a ton of super-broad IP from failed startups at auction, and then threaten litigation against accused infringers, i.e., you.
See?<eos> I stuck to my guns and as a result, we now have 20 grand we would have otherwise lost if I had listened to you delicate little snowflakes and settled.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Twenty grand.<eos> Yeah, so let me cum into a bucket and have you all drink it.
Josh, he's my sister's son.<eos> How could I just...<eos> So you're okay with letting our own son die?<eos> What kind of mother are you?<eos> I cannot imagine the difficulty this must be for the two of you, but again, we are doing everything that we can.
I mean, he cares a great deal.<eos> Just to be safe, we'd like to observe him in the hospital overnight.<eos> Then probably a good idea for the three of you to sit down and have a talk.<eos> They're getting a room for him upstairs.<eos> I'll let you know when it's ready.
But they're working for senator Nadeer, and what she really wants is inside this case.<eos> It's a cure...<eos> For inhumans.<eos> Hold your fire.<eos> I don't suppose she told you how much this was worth.
It's a cure...<eos> For inhumans.<eos> Hold your fire.<eos> I don't suppose she told you how much this was worth.<eos> Probably a lot more than she's paying you.
If we can't find the real May, then that's all that's left of her.<eos> We'll find her.<eos> I promise.<eos> We'll return in a moment.<eos> To a success, though a narrow escape for both of you.
- Honestly, is this really necessary?<eos> I'm Jeffrey Mace.<eos> Welcome to S.H.I.E.L.D.<eos> Sorry about the hoods, but trust is a luxury these days.<eos> That being said, Ward vouched for you, so I'm happy to provide you sanctuary.
You know, Skye hasn't been herself ever since you showed up.<eos> What is it that you're really after?<eos> You, of all people, the Hydra double agent, are doubting my loyalty.<eos> - That is rich.<eos> - But don't forget, you're only here because I trust him, not you.
I can't be sure, but we need to find him as quickly as possible.<eos> I'm sorry. With all that's going on, I can't send a team today.<eos> Then send us.<eos> With all due respect, this is a spy organization... and you're a teacher.<eos> Seems you need all the help you can get.
I am.<eos> So I read that you two met at an audition.<eos> Is that a real story?<eos> - That is a real story.<eos> - Yeah. So you liked each other's acting?
I know things got heated between us the other night, but as far as I'm concerned, it's water under the bridge, so if you're wondering if I'm still upset at you...<eos> I'm not.<eos> And this is to make sure you're still not upset with me after you hear what I'm about to say.<eos> Why am I holding a check for $500,000?<eos> Because I've decided to go back to Pearson Specter Litt, and I gave you my word that I wouldn't leave you high and dry.
- [Joel] Cole!<eos> - So glad you made it.<eos> - It's good to meet you.<eos> - Great to meet you.<eos> Why are you guys dressed like that?
It's not possible to prove a negative.<eos> Words spoken by every hack who's ever copied someone else's technology and claimed it as their own.<eos> What's going on here?<eos> I came to you to negotiate an exclusion in good faith.<eos> And we're prepared to offer you...
I don't give a shit about helping people.<eos> I give a shit about helping me, which is why I want $50,000.<eos> I just told you...<eos> You cost me millions.<eos> So if you want my help... okay, never mind.
I love you.<eos> I love you too, Mom.<eos> Which is better, gold or purple?<eos> - Purple. - Purple.<eos> You don't like gold?
Yeah, well, that doesn't make me like him any better. He's still our father.<eos> You asked me to pay his hospital bills, and I shouldn't even have done that.<eos> Stop contacting me.<eos> Welcome.<eos> Let me start by telling you what I am not going to ask you to do over the next couple days... anything that you don't want to do.
I promise.<eos> Speaking of which, I need to get back there because if we have any more delays,<eos> Andres is gonna need a trailer load of Xanax.<eos> Don't worry, I'll save you some.<eos> So now I want you all to picture the person in your life that you feel has held you back the most.
Now yours.<eos> You can pry Peacemaker from my cold dead hands.<eos> I think I'll have one of the boys here do that for me.<eos> So you brought your magic gun just in case there was a demon attack?<eos> I brought my magic gun to remind you all that I'm the goddamn Earp heir and the only one who can send Wyatt's revenants back to hell.
Agh!<eos> Now you're sober, you can tell us more. I...<eos> I swear, I didn't do it.<eos> You took her to the drugs unit in Homerton hospital.<eos> - Who told you that?
This is a murder investigation.<eos> She was 17, for God's sake.<eos> We think he's harbouring our prime suspect.<eos> If you don't touch him, we'll agree to a fair exchange of information.<eos> We'll show you ours if... well, you know.
Hey! Excuse me!<eos> Everyone!<eos> Thank you.<eos> Now all you bitches quiet down so my Muslim friend here can talk a little bit.<eos> Um... yeah. So we been talking, and we have a plan we'd like to run by all of you concerning the demands.
Von Barlow is Caputo's girlfriend?<eos> And the owner of the formidable cock.<eos> Flac. What the fuck, bro?<eos> Hey, Taystee, you wanna check our work?<eos> I trust you.
This is one of those rare grammatical instances where "don't" and "won't" mean the same thing.<eos> I knew your parents a long time ago, when things were very different.<eos> Those were fierce and formidable days.<eos> But I don't talk about that, and you won't hear about that.<eos> I shouldn't have to tell you orphans there are many, many things to be afraid of in this world.
Business cards aren't proof of anything.<eos> Anyone can go to a print shop and have cards made that say anything they like.<eos> Well, you're just a heap of facts, aren't you, Klaus?<eos> Facts and facts and facts and facts!<eos> But none of them do you any good.
You can just knock down the walls.<eos> You're gonna get us all home!<eos> I can't.<eos> I don't have my powers on this planet.<eos> But I will help you.
Damn, that was badass.<eos> Let's get out of here.<eos> Put it down.<eos> We should attack now.<eos> Let me tell you how an ultimatum works.
Call that a landing?<eos> Gideon, are you back?<eos> Yeah, are you still trying to kill us?<eos> I am really quite sorry about that.<eos> How many times must I tell you people? Mick Rory is not to pilot this ship.
He says Lallorian lager is for weak-minded idiots.<eos> Like you.<eos> Yeah...<eos> That is a very, very valid point.<eos> So why don't I buy you gentlemen something... Something stronger, right?
No, sweetie.<eos> If I'm going to move forward, I can't ignore my past.<eos> Cadmus... Changed me, they tried to break me.<eos> But in the process, they made me dangerous.<eos> I know their weaknesses, and I'm here... To work with all of you to make our planet safer.
If you say "a drink", I swear, I...<eos> Oh, I was going to say "deep breath", but that is a much better idea.<eos> 'Cause Zakarian Ale always takes the edge off.<eos> I'm gonna go get a bottle.<eos> Like I said to the other guy that came in to talk to me, I got nothing to say to you people.
J'onn... Don't do this.<eos> Project Exodus.<eos> It's almost ready.<eos> "The Overman shall be the meaning of the Earth.<eos> "Remain faithful to the Earth, "and do not believe those who speak to you of otherworldly hopes."
You can at least take that to your grave.<eos> Freeze!<eos> Oh, thank God.<eos> Nice job, guys.<eos> It took you long enough.
We should catch up sometime.<eos> Sure. That would be good.<eos> Sometime.<eos> I should go.<eos> And let you guys get up to whatever you've got going on.
No! Fine.<eos> Oh.<eos> Bloody hell!<eos> I am almost 100% positive that we just had a tiny earthquake.<eos> Did I tell you, Brian is in town, and he was flirting with me?
I'm just gonna have to be celibate for five years.<eos> And in five years, I'll be... 42.<eos> So there's that.<eos> I'll be a 42-year-old who Hasn't had sex in five years, who has a child, whose father is still in his 20s and has his whole life ahead of him.<eos> And even then... even then with all my mistakes piled around me like the empty pizza boxes from last night's depression feast, even then I will not give you that dress. But you'll think about it, right?
Wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> The truth is, um, I like Brian and I didn't want my hormones making decisions for me with him or with you the other night, which I'm really sorry about.<eos> Do you smell coconut?<eos> I do. Isn't that weird?<eos> I shouldn't have come on to you like that.
But I'd like to assure you that if you ever get crazy-pregnant-horny again,<eos> I am still here for you.<eos> It's a deal.<eos> Okay. Your palm is orange, too?<eos> I need to tell you something. No...
I am still here for you.<eos> It's a deal.<eos> Okay. Your palm is orange, too?<eos> I need to tell you something. No...<eos> I need to tell you something.
It's a deal.<eos> Okay. Your palm is orange, too?<eos> I need to tell you something. No...<eos> I need to tell you something.<eos> Your advice was such good advice that you can borrow my dress.
You and Ladriya go speak to Mr. Cutter, the CEO of Hanka.<eos> Major and Batou take a look at Dahlin report.<eos> Find out what has been recovered from the geisha.<eos> Major!<eos> I told you not jump off.
My parents?<eos> The way they died?<eos> Did that happen?<eos> No.<eos> We gave you false memories.
2571 isn not a failure.<eos> I will delete all the data and reprogram her.<eos> - She won't remember him at all.<eos> - No, no, no...<eos> You download all the data on the terrorist and then I order you to terminate.
She likes you.<eos> I was looking for...<eos> No, come in.<eos> Yeah, come come.<eos> - Can I offer you some tea?
But we were getting along famously until somebody decided to interrupt.<eos> Stick to the path.<eos> Here, honey.<eos> There's a lot of unmarked graves on the island.<eos> I'll bet whoever sold you that shirt is in one of them.
We are all Triple-X.<eos> We just have different agendas.<eos> She wants to destroy it.<eos> I'm gonna use it.<eos> And I'll be damned if I'm gonna let you take it back to the NSA.
And then Igor on the stairs.<eos> See where we're going with this?<eos> But none of that matters.<eos> 'Cause like I said, if you take this from me, you die first.<eos> I'll take it from you dead or alive.
Not if we find him first.<eos> Whoa! Red light!<eos> Red light!<eos> Did you know traffic signals were invented by Big Oil to waste fuel and drive up profits?<eos> If I say yes, will you please just slow down? Look out!
Judge?<eos> Sikes.<eos> Martha?<eos> This is really not a good.<eos> Yes, I will let you know as soon as.
- Why?<eos> - Well, that's not important.<eos> What matters is, I gotta figure out a way to get that money so we can get the hell out of here.<eos> What's to figure?<eos> What? You think Dawkins is just gonna give you the money?
I told you, man, I didn't take Ed's money.<eos> Really?<eos> After all that's happened, you're still gonna lie to me?<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> I want to you admit that Ed paid you to drop the reckless manslaughter charge.
- Oh, Daddy had to work late, sugarplum.<eos> I mean, you know, this is all just a big mistake.<eos> Andy would never get involved in anything like this.<eos> Martha, I saw him there with my own two eyes.<eos> Well, your eyes deceived you, plain and simple.
What the fuck?<eos> Shit, what's happening? What the fuck is going on?<eos> - Justice, Ed. - Justice.<eos> Justice for what?<eos> We couldn't just let you get away with it.
Bina, you're the dummy who voted me into office.<eos> Okay, impeached.<eos> Too late. I resign.<eos> I was first.<eos> This could be a great thing for you, sweetie.
Nikki can calm down.<eos> What is the deal with Nikki?<eos> Really?<eos> Wow. "What's the deal with Nikki?" That's funny.<eos> Why would you care about Nikki if you're just here for my sister?
People do unconscionable things in hotel bathtubs.<eos> Okay, I'm sorry.<eos> Bina, stand up. Bina, please, stand up right now, please.<eos> Why?<eos> I will give you 20 unhypothetical dollars if you stand up right now.
I don't want to get involved with hookers.<eos> They don't provide them.<eos> You guys probably already know this, but that's not a question you're supposed to ask a fancy place like this unless you're a successful businessman.<eos> Which I am.<eos> Are you okay? You looked like you got sick.
We'll work on the wording before you try again.<eos> You're coming with me.<eos> Hello, friend.<eos> Just stay right there.<eos> Is this the guy you meant?
What did you say back there? It was...<eos> What did you do?<eos> It was hard to hear, you know, with, like, the wind and Nikki in my ear, and then, when I got on the railing, everybody started shouting.<eos> And then underwater, you can't, like, hear anything underwater.<eos> But it sounded like, you know, you were getting to something good.
Oh, yeah, lam.<eos> Well, We are.<eos> Here you go, Ringo.<eos> Okay, you're sure you didn't forget anybody?<eos> I told you a million times, okay? I didn't forget anybody.
Teddy, where's the baby?<eos> Baby. Oh, man!<eos> Come on, man.<eos> I know, I'm sorry.<eos> It's just, you know, if you forget the baby... I'm not sure I believe you when you say you didn't forget any of our friends.
Okay, God, I know I never pray to you unless somebody is sick.<eos> Or somebody's dying or in an airplane. But, God, please don't let me lose him.<eos> But if you get me this one thing, God... This one thing... I will never ever ask you for another thing as long as I live.<eos> Let them be there, God.<eos> Oh, thank God. Oh, God, thank you.
I know what's your car looks like.<eos> And I know there had to be some mom at that park... who got a picture of you.<eos> They saw you. And you ran a bunch of red lights at that park too.<eos> And there are red light camera all over the place.<eos> And I know they would've got you too.
Open the door before he changes his mind.<eos> You want him to kill your son?<eos> Follow him.<eos> Where do I go?<eos> Just keep going straight, I'll tell you where to go.
Go, go, go.<eos> So now what's the plan?<eos> You don't really even have a plan, do you?<eos> You have no idea what to even do right now.<eos> You need her... You need her to tell you what to do, don't you?
Hi, you guys, I'm back.<eos> - Come on, it's time to come down now.<eos> - I want my mommy. It's okay, sweetheart.<eos> Come on down.<eos> Come on, honey. I'm here to help you.
This is how it must be.<eos> Another woman will come.<eos> You will see.<eos> There will be another.<eos> You will know her... by the love she shows to you.
My name is Verena, and I'm going to be staying here for a while.<eos> I promise I'm not like the others.<eos> I'm much worse.<eos> Please look at me, Jakob.<eos> I'd like to help you. Do you understand?
Braver than the others.<eos> I have some things I need to ask.<eos> What things?<eos> Tomorrow... perhaps.<eos> To begin with, I will tell you what I see.
Come with me, please.<eos> I think you're afraid that if you speak, the voice will cease.<eos> Come.<eos> We'll listen together.<eos> I'll tell you what I hear.
More adoration as she leaves the stage.<eos> What are you telling me, Jakob?<eos> That I'm wrong, or that I'm right?<eos> You can't...<eos> I do it to help you, Jakob.
The thing is, you don't get to know.<eos> You don't wake up with a bad feeling in your stomach or see shadows move.<eos> If you're like me, you wake up 24 minutes and 47 seconds before your best friend is supposed to be picking you up.<eos> If you're like me, your last day starts like this.<eos> Well, I'll let you know by noon.
Well, I'll let you know by noon.<eos> Well, I can't organize a playdate before...<eos> You want something to eat?<eos> No. I'm good.<eos> Sammy, you like the bird I made you?
Yeah, I talk shit. Yeah, she's talkin' shit.<eos> How many roses did you get last year, Linds?<eos> Twenty-two.<eos> I'm going for 25 this year, though, and more than one of them better be from Patrick.<eos> Did I tell you I sat next to Rob, and I had to make him fill out the request form?
Last year, Matt literally sent me a dozen red roses.<eos> Matt, oh, come on.<eos> You just spent a whole week crying in the same pair of sweatpants and it got dark.<eos> We're not going back there.<eos> No, I've told you a thousand times, I'll say it again, you do not need that loser.
Sisyphus.<eos> Back to Sisyphus, class.<eos> Yo, Sam.<eos> Sam, hey.<eos> Did you like it?
And don't tense up, because that only makes it worse.<eos> Great.<eos> That sounds really romantic.<eos> Don't worry. It's not like Rob is some random guy.<eos> You actually like him.
- Yeah.<eos> She freaked me out.<eos> Sam, you're 20 minutes late!<eos> Let's shake it, sister!<eos> Sammy, you like the bird I made you?
What truck?<eos> It wasn't a dream.<eos> It really happened.<eos> Again.<eos> Sammy, you like the bird I made you?
It really happened.<eos> Again.<eos> Sammy, you like the bird I made you?<eos> It's origami.<eos> Mommy says you have to get up.
Do you ever feel like you're living the same day over and over again with only, like, a few things being different?<eos> Oh, shit, Samantha.<eos> You just described my whole life!<eos> Hey, what's up?<eos> Hey, Sam. Did you have to ask permission to talk to me?
She's Lindsay. She's ours. We're each other's, you know?<eos> Just apologize.<eos> You're not listening to me. I'm not sorry.<eos> Please, Sam?<eos> Why do you care so much, Elody?
You remember the camping trip when I supposedly peed in my sleeping bag?<eos> Lindsay's the one who peed.<eos> When everyone asked what happened, she just pointed her finger at me and screamed, "She did it."<eos> Juliet...<eos> Please let me help you.
Yeah.<eos> Why would I talk about something that happened a thousand years ago?<eos> Because it happened to you.<eos> And you matter to me.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.
You don't know me.<eos> You could never understand.<eos> You have a choice, Juliet. Not everybody gets that.<eos> Sam!<eos> Please let me help you.
We should get Rys out of the city while we can.<eos> But school's about to start.<eos> Oh, he's so excited, Jan, with his new pencils, and his shoes...<eos> You're not listening to me.<eos> I'm trying to tell you something.
Come back to me, come here.<eos> People always want to run when they don't know what's coming.<eos> It's their first instinct, always to run.<eos> - Come. - It's not good for a child.<eos> It's not good, Jan, I'm telling you.
You paved the way with pigs.<eos> What a crack-brained idea, and what splendid luck for us!<eos> I'll work with him.<eos> We can keep our eye on him with the bison here.<eos> Well, he trusts you, that's clear.
We have two doors.<eos> One opens into the free side of the city, the other, into the ghetto.<eos> In one way, out the other, you understand me?<eos> Yes.<eos> I will give you papers that will give you access either way.
I've never seen him before.<eos> He is Dr. Kleinhauser.<eos> He is with me.<eos> Do you want me to go to the Labor Bureau?<eos> Do you want me to waste Dr. Ziegler's time, his valuable time, to have him come all the way here, to talk to you, to tell you that he is with me?
-Mom!<eos> -Aboy?<eos> -Boy...<eos> -Aboy!<eos> -Are you okay?
Ididn'tknowwhy .<eos> Hey, Bailey.<eos> Captain America, remember?<eos> He could take out that bomb in a second.<eos> Oh, you like it, don't you?
-What?<eos> -Jim, can you help me?<eos> -I don't know how to make a Singapore sling.<eos> What?<eos> Oh, I'll show you.
Well, we... we really need you on the road.<eos> That's the backbone of the whole operation really.<eos> I'll be honest, Jim.<eos> You are one of our best traveling salesmen.<eos> I mean, I would be crazy to take you out of the field.
-Oh, I'm gonna go!<eos> Fine, I'll go.<eos> Will you just come back inside...<eos> Stop it, eliz... Shut up! Shut up!<eos> Just come back inside. I am trying to help you, Jim.
Come on. -Really? Oh!<eos> -Yeah.<eos> -Okay, you wait here. Okay, boss dog?<eos> -Okay.<eos> You wait here. I'll get you something to eat, okay?
You're jealous because fallon's had her baby, and that's made you even more paranoid. Hmm. Okay, Alexis gonna get her butt whupped<eos> -she keep running off the mouth like that.<eos> -Right? -'Cause krystle's not gonna take much more of this.<eos> -Uh-uh. - I haven't. - This is crazy.<eos> -Ooh! -I told you. I told you.
But I guess he's not home.<eos> Hi, Ethan.<eos> Hi, Hannah.<eos> I brought your dog home.<eos> Must have been tough on you, losing your husband after all those years.
Oh,comeon !<eos> Hey, thanks for bringing back my dog.<eos> You're welcome. Bye.<eos> Hey, Hannah.<eos> I owe you an apology.
And I just want you to know that not a day goes by that I don't kick myself for doing that.<eos> There'sthatsweatysmell.<eos> You think, uh, it'd be crazy if... We did something together?<eos> Are you asking me out on a date?<eos> Well, I just think that I'd be an all-time fool if I just watched you drive away.
I mean, everybody's got something valuable to offer if you just take the time to listen.<eos> Nope.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Saggy-balls motherfucker!<eos> And if you're lucky enough to find a friend or two in this world... well, brother, you've hit the jackpot.
I had a little girl.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I put her up for adoption... before I went to L.A.<eos> Pippi... you need to tell me right now if you're joking around.<eos> Wilson, we sent you papers.
I mean... don't you want to see her in the flesh?<eos> What are you saying now?<eos> What do you want to do, stalk her?<eos> Holy Christ, Pippi.<eos> Where do you come up with this shit?
No! I'm not letting go!<eos> Let it go!<eos> Wilson!<eos> I'm gonna kick his ass!<eos> Believe me, Pippi gave you a true gift... by giving you away, because we were in no position to be parents.
Come on.<eos> How about I take you for ice cream?<eos> Is that supposed to be funny?<eos> Yeah, let's get the fat girl some ice cream.<eos> Hey, not everybody's out to get you, Claire.
Pippi.<eos> I was afraid I'd never see you again.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I want you to know that I fully understand why you didn't come to Dad's funeral.<eos> And I also know that things were tougher for you after I left.
I'm so happy.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> When Claire turned on me at the trial... I don't think I've ever been more devastated.<eos> I just thank you for not testifying against me.
I know... that I fucked everything up.<eos> I'm just asking for the tiniest... shred of hope that you might someday... let me be a small part of your life.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I'm just gonna come right out and say it:<eos> I want to move to Portland and help you with the baby and... And... make up for all my mistakes.
- Sir, trust in what I say. Change your course.<eos> You dare to give me orders, boy?<eos> Arrest him!<eos> Turner!<eos> I'll not let you kill us all.
- No, I'm not.<eos> Am I a witch for having catalogued over 200 stars? - Witch!<eos> There's a Bloodmoon coming.<eos> I simply need to purchase a chronometer.<eos> I pay you double for selling to a woman.
Quite happily, he's dead.<eos> Very, very, dead. Ship went down!<eos> Inside the triangle.<eos> He's coming for you Jack, to seek revenge, as the dead man's tale is told.<eos> I don't believe you.
And quite possibly out of business.<eos> I'll be needing some time with your witch.<eos> I've been expecting you Captain.<eos> Perhaps you'd like some tea.<eos> I shall pass, thank you kindly.
The oceans have turned to blood.<eos> Best stay on dry land, where it's safe.<eos> - I'm about to be executed on dry land.<eos> - Good point.<eos> Did I ever tell you the one about the skeleton?
My name's Captain Barbossa I stand before you, - with cordial intent.<eos> - I don't need any cordial intent.<eos> Do you hear that?<eos> The pirate wishes to be cordial.<eos> So let me show you what my cordiality is, hombre.
Krakens don't speak, everyone knows that. - Of course.<eos> I never should have saved you.<eos> Last night there was a Bloodmoon, just as you described.<eos> - Tell me what it revealed.<eos> - Why should I trust you?
- Why should I trust you?<eos> You trusted me to hold your port, remember?<eos> - It was my stern.<eos> Clearly you need to spend more time at sea.<eos> Tell me what you found and I promise to help you.
One ship was trying to escape through the smoke.<eos> It's a lovely day for a sail, innit?<eos> And there, in the crow's nest, there was this young pirate boy.<eos> The way I see it, it's just the two of us left.<eos> You surrender to me now, and I'll let you live. Simple.
You surrender to me now, and I'll let you live. Simple.<eos> He stood there, looking like a little bird.<eos> And from that day he earned himself a name that would haunt me for the rest of my days:<eos> Jack the Sparrow.<eos> Right then, you surrender to me now and I'll let you live.
He stood there, looking like a little bird.<eos> And from that day he earned himself a name that would haunt me for the rest of my days:<eos> Jack the Sparrow.<eos> Right then, you surrender to me now and I'll let you live.<eos> I shall let you live.
Honor?<eos> !<eos> What honor, hombre? What honor?<eos> You don't know what honor is.<eos> Spare me my life and I'll fetch you the Sparrow.
- What?<eos> The power of the sea.<eos> "To release the power of the sea all must divide".<eos> If the Trident holds all the power, then... Then every curse is held inside.<eos> As I told you before, surrender to me now and I will let you live.
- Thank you, I remember you.<eos> - Cheers, thank you. - Oh good!<eos> - Master Gibbs.<eos> - The ship is yours Captain.<eos> I thank you!
This was the worst pyramid scheme since the actual pyramids.<eos> - Ruth loves to go to the California Pizza Kitchen. - Paul Schaffer:<eos> Yeah. And they say that her favorite dish there is the veal scallo-Ponzi.<eos> Listen, I have something to tell you that's really important.<eos> I have your money! I can get it to you.
Yeah, that's me.<eos> Can you believe I've known this man for 50 years?<eos> Carl, listen, I wanna tell you something.<eos> Not now.<eos> There are some real opportunities in the market right now and I wanna make you aware of them.
Carl, listen, I wanna tell you something.<eos> Not now.<eos> There are some real opportunities in the market right now and I wanna make you aware of them.<eos> - Not now, Bernie. - I know, I know.<eos> - Not now. - I know. I wouldn't tell you about them unless they were really, really important, okay?
Are you not happy with that? Was that not good enough for you?<eos> It is definitely good enough for me, Dad.<eos> - Well, then shut the fuck up and give me a little fucking gratitude.<eos> Say, "I'm... thanks, Dad." Can't you do that?<eos> What, do you think the whole fucking world owes you something?
Andy's voice:<eos> Okay, I'll see you when I get home.<eos> Dad?<eos> Oh, fucking back spasms. It's all seized up. This is the only position that doesn't kill.<eos> I'm sorry. Can I get you something?
Come on. Well...<eos> well, look... I'm thinking about taking office space somewhere else.<eos> You're thinking about leaving the business?<eos> I'm ready to strike out on my own.<eos> And here I was worried about the business I handed you.
- No, this is about all of us. I... I am sick and tired of you acting like it's not.<eos> - You know... - So what do you want, Steph?<eos> Just some acknowledgement.<eos> Reporter on TV: Financial swindler Bernie Madoff is awaiting sentencing at the Manhattan Correctional Facility as investigators dig in to see if those who were closest to Madoff... Great.<eos> But it's clear the money trail is not real. Catherine: Every day, Mark sends you articles, things he's read, things that pissed him off.
I wrote Bernie a letter a week after Mark killed himself.<eos> And I never sent it to him because they monitor his mail and I thought they would never, ever give him a letter like this.<eos> Joy Behar: Well, here, you can say it on TV.<eos> He's probably watching.<eos> Well, what I wrote to him was, "Bernie, while I will not send you pictures of your grandchildren, there is one picture I do want you to see.
That last picture of your son Mark. You owe it to his widow, his children, his brother, his mother.<eos> So, here is what I wish for you, Bernie.<eos> Every time you sit down to eat, as you pick up your plastic fork,<eos> I want you to see your son's corpse hanging from the rafter directly over your table right on front of you, Bernie, so at every meal, you see your son Mark... his white sweat socks are swaying<eos> ever so gently at your eye level immediately above your food dish. And as you look up, Bernie, you see... you see your firstborn son hanging there, his head at a left leaning angle looking down at you, asking how could you do that to your son who up until two years before his death

- Not bad.<eos> - Your words really hit home with me.<eos> Keep watching, kid.<eos> Sir, any chance a hard working guy who's ready to put the job first could catch a break and come work for you?<eos> Why the hell would I give you a job?
Just tax reasons, baby.<eos> Let me worry about the business, okay?<eos> - I've done well so far, right?<eos> - Excellent.<eos> Did I tell you who called me the other day?
Why are they holding you without bail?<eos> You know they're saying they're gonna charge me.<eos> No, no, no, no. The lawyers are going to straighten this out.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> Nothing is gonna happen to you.
Your civic duty to punish me for a crime I didn't commit and something that you know nothing about.<eos> You know what, go fuck yourself, Mr. Oakland.<eos> It's go fuck yourself, Bill.<eos> - I'd like to request a transfer.<eos> - You're not allowed to leave the room.
Believe me, there is nothing fun about spending time with this man.<eos> Hey, it's me calling, I just want to let you know that I went to the store and I'm gonna cook you one hell of a sexy dinner.<eos> So work up an appetite.<eos> Hey, it's me calling.<eos> Have I told you lately how brilliant and bold and how beautiful, and brave, and all the other b-words that mean perfect man, that you are?
So I hear you finally got a woman's voice.<eos> - Is that you, Gavin?<eos> - The one and only.<eos> Come in for a minute, sit down.<eos> I just wanted to come by and say that it's been real fun hanging out with you.
I'm the super, he expecting you?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Hey, you want a beer?<eos> Thanks, but it's a little early for me.<eos> Don't ever let people tell you how to live.
You don't have a vacuum cleaner?<eos> No.<eos> - Bill.<eos> - I don't entertain much.<eos> So what are you having me do all of this for?
I'm not allowed to leave the room.<eos> I know, so we'd better not get caught.<eos> - I want to hold onto you.<eos> - But I don't know if I know how to do this.<eos> It's okay, I'll show you.
You're not at all what I thought you were.<eos> Well, I actually misjudged you as well.<eos> I said that you were self-centered, narcissistic and blind and I realized that you're self-centered, narcissistic, blind and a little charming.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you, Wes.
Wait a minute, you came all this way, and you're not at least curious to see what a blind man's apartment looks like?<eos> Well, I didn't realize that it was different.<eos> Come on.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Can I get you something to drink?
Thank you.<eos> So tell me, dinner at the French restaurant, the stroll the wine I don't know, is this part of the normal Bill Oakland routine?<eos> Actually, I haven't had a woman up to this apartment in five years.<eos> Well, I guess then I should be honored.<eos> - May I ask you a question?
Oh, yeah.<eos> You're welcome, Mr. Dutchman.<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> - Just in the neighborhood.<eos> Did Mark have you follow me?
Who do I have the pleasure of addressing?<eos> Mark Dutchman.<eos> Suzanne's my wife.<eos> Dutchman's not your real last name, is it?<eos> - What makes you say that?
- Your voice has a ring of Queens to it.<eos> Polished, but you can never take all the Far Rockaway out of there, now can you?<eos> - And where are you from?<eos> You got balls for a blind man.<eos> I'll give you that.
- I don't wanna fight with you, Mark.<eos> - No, I wanna know.<eos> I need to know.<eos> What is it you do?<eos> You really need me to spell that out for you?
I'm gonna say once, only once.<eos> Do not see Suzanne again.<eos> That's fine.<eos> Just don't ask me to keep my hands off her.<eos> You think you can say that shit to my face and I'm gonna give you a pass because you're blind?
Just tell me what you need, Suzanne.<eos> Tell me. And I swear to God I'll give it to you.<eos> You're my everything, baby.<eos> You know that, everything.<eos> I know I know you think you love him but let me tell you something.
It's only wrong if you stay with him.<eos> - That's not an answer Suzanne.<eos> - He's my husband.<eos> Yes, I still love him.<eos> I don't believe you.
- I got your stick right here.<eos> - Don't move, don't move. I'm right here, yeah.<eos> - Buddy, you okay?<eos> Hey. It's me calling.<eos> I just wanted to tell you to be nice tonight.
What?<eos> Here.<eos> Nothing Left To Win Or Lose.<eos> When I was cleaning your apartment.<eos> I would have told you, but I knew you wouldn't let me read it.
- What are you, what are you...<eos> No, stop!<eos> - Let it burn, Gavin!<eos> - No! Let it burn!<eos> - What the fuck is wrong with you?
Still so handsome, my king.<eos> Why has the water dropped?<eos> Why does the sword reveal itself now?<eos> I'm not ready, the tower is not complete.<eos> As your power increases, so, too, do the forces that will oppose you.
We both developed a palate for power.<eos> I've never had any power. Or any desire to achieve it.<eos> Sire,<eos> I could simply drift away, never to be seen again.<eos> As much as I'd like to believe you, your character makes that unlikely.
Come on. Move!<eos> Now!<eos> Someone gonna tell me where we're going? No.<eos> So what is it you're looking at, then?<eos> Are you falling for me like I'm falling for you?
But what we are interested in is what you can do with this sword.<eos> Why don't you leave him with me for a minute or two, boss?<eos> Put your ring back on, honey tits.<eos> You haven't had enough porridge this morning to talk like that.<eos> And if you like that sword so much, Your Lordship, you can keep it to peel your grapes.
Tomorrow. I don't have to remind you of what will happen if he doesn't come.<eos> I'll start with the little boy.<eos> Now, take the girl and go.<eos> This venom will induce that which is hidden from you.<eos> It will show you things you do not want to see.
Eternity.<eos> Don't be shy.<eos> It's okay. It's a special thing.<eos> It's a special thing.<eos> Do you like these people?
Can you see my soul?<eos> Is it still there?<eos> What's so funny?<eos> How well do you know this guy?<eos> And how come he's letting you stay at his place?
You want one of those?<eos> You wanna be me?<eos> Where do you get a jacket like this?<eos> Makes you walk different.<eos> Get you a hundred jackets like that.
What can I get for you?<eos> - I have a condition.<eos> - Yes'?<eos> Uh, I can't be left alone... for more than five minutes.<eos> Can I get you something else?
- Maybe you... As a... as a country...<eos> Take your finger outta your ear. Put it back up your ass.<eos> You think you're better than me, don't you?<eos> You look down on me.<eos> I gave you everything, man.
Blood gas tech to CCU, stat.<eos> Hey.<eos> I said 3:30.<eos> He's got to be there by 4:00.<eos> Sorry. I was grabbing you some... Some flowers.
He's got to be there by 4:00.<eos> Sorry. I was grabbing you some... Some flowers.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What's that?<eos> I was gonna tell you, but you kept canceling.
Mr. Downs, this is Stan Rubino.<eos> I learned you have something that's mine.<eos> The 25 kilos of cocaine you stole.<eos> Listen, that was a mistake.<eos> I'll get you your product.
Look, if you hurt him... You know what it is.<eos> Mr. Downs, let's not get carried away.<eos> I guess you know what kind of man I am.<eos> Okay. Okay.<eos> I'll get your stuff and I'll bring it right to you.
Man, I'll fix it.<eos> Calm down.<eos> Get the bag.<eos> I can't believe you thought I'd do some shit like that, man.<eos> I hit you when I'm on the way back.
It's embarrassing.<eos> Even worse...<eos> The whole goddamn world knows I'm vulnerable.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Yeah, I know you are.
Looks like you've done pretty damn well for yourself.<eos> Let me have a water, please.<eos> From what I buy from you for the clients here, I... I save a little back every month.<eos> That 25 kilos was my safety net.<eos> And why do you need a safety net?
Let me have a water, please.<eos> From what I buy from you for the clients here, I... I save a little back every month.<eos> That 25 kilos was my safety net.<eos> And why do you need a safety net?<eos> When you hang with scumbags, you need a safety net.
My cousin's.<eos> So look...<eos> My family... We have a lot of friends.<eos> So there's gonna be nowhere that you can go that we won't be able to find you.<eos> So I'm giving you one hour.
Right.<eos> You're right. I'm not even here.<eos> Looks official.<eos> You're not coming in here.<eos> Look, you got three options, either you let me pass or I'll whup your funny-looking ass or I can arrest you.
Thomas, I want you to stay right there.<eos> I'm on my way.<eos> Dad, I'm scared.<eos> I know, I know.<eos> There's a lot of things I gotta explain to you.
I got all the information on you and could've took you down.<eos> I'm protecting you.<eos> You're protecting me?<eos> You internal affairs, nigga!<eos> That's what I'm trying to make you understand.
He knew things about me, my case.<eos> Even if he's lying.<eos> We never checked the garage.<eos> What, you...<eos> You okay?
Oh, shit!<eos> Wait, wait!<eos> D!<eos> D! What the fuck are you doing here?<eos> Thomas, are you okay?
- Really? - Yeah.<eos> Books?<eos> Yeah, books, yeah, long time ago.<eos> Must be hard work.<eos> - ...can I ask you a question? - Sure.
Nothing better.<eos> How do you get by?<eos> I do what I have to do.<eos> Then I move on.<eos> Nothing you miss?
No.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> Probably working for my ex.<eos> Is that a joke?<eos> Let me show you to your room.
Because I can't afford to stay.<eos> You know, can't sell any of my work.<eos> Besides, there's nothing left for me here.<eos> Not without my wife.<eos> I can help you.
You write it.<eos> But you gotta be committed.<eos> Okay, sure, yeah.<eos> When do you think you'll be done?<eos> Who said you could read the script? Why not?
Maybe the truck driver should come back into the story towards the end.<eos> I have a better ending in mind.<eos> Hard to speak a single word, isn't it?<eos> That's where your script fails.<eos> That was the only way to show you.
That's where your script fails.<eos> That was the only way to show you.<eos> The woman on the run in your script she's about to have her throat slit. - What the fuck? - And you have her pleading with him.<eos> If she reacted like you just did that would be realistic.<eos> I just wanted to show you some real.
First you put a knife to my throat, then a gun to my head.<eos> And maybe I am crazy, too, because why I didn't toss you out day one, is baffling to me.<eos> You still don't get it, do you, Paul?<eos> I'm the one writing the story.<eos> I mean, I gave you your chance until you had that brilliant idea to open the door.
- And I need the police to find that out. - You need the police?<eos> I can recognize a sign from providence when I come across one because I have received so few.<eos> Oy, come over here.<eos> Hands on your head, get on the ground.<eos> I am grateful to you, Jack.
Dress him for the part.<eos> I have to say you really made me earn this.<eos> You think you know more than me about reality?<eos> I'm only a writer, right?<eos> I'm gonna show you reality.
You owe this to me.<eos> It was up to me to pick you up on the road.<eos> My decision, my idea, it was always my story.<eos> Was it real enough for you? It seems like it was.<eos> I gave you all of this!
We got aliens.<eos> We got big, green guys tearing down buildings.<eos> When I was a kid I used to draw cowboys and Indians.<eos> Actually, it's Native American, but...<eos> Yeah, tell you what, though...
- We're supposed to turn this in, right?<eos> - I ain't hauling it.<eos> It's too bad.<eos> We could've made some pretty cool stuff from all that alien junk.<eos> I tell you what.
- Well did you have my number?<eos> - No, I mean we'll call you.<eos> Like, someone will call you.<eos> Alright?<eos> That's not a hug, I'm just grabbing the door for you.
You know I'm a curious person by nature.<eos> I've finished designing that high altitude vacuum seal...<eos> In case you wanna, you know, go for the big one?<eos> You're still on that?<eos> I told you, no.
The door will most likely remain closed until morning.<eos> Morning?<eos> Hey, suit lady.<eos> I kinda feel bad calling you "Suit Lady", you know?<eos> I think I should probably give you a name.
- He's supposed to be doing a deal with him.<eos> - Yes!<eos> Yeah!<eos> Hey.<eos> I didn't tell you where.
Silly.<eos> Just...<eos> Yeah.<eos> Where is it?<eos> Can I give you some advice?
Previously on "Peter screws the Pooch," I thought you'd stayed away from this, instead, you hacked a multi-million dollar suit so you could sneak around, behind my back, doing the one thing I told you not to do.<eos> - Is everyone okay?<eos> - No thanks to you.<eos> No thanks to me?<eos> Those weapons were out there and I tried to tell you about it, but you didn't listen.
I got a few secrets of my own.<eos> Of all the reasons I didn't want my daughter to date...<eos> Peter, nothing is more important than family.<eos> You saved my daughter's life and I could never forget something like that.<eos> So I'm gonna give you one chance.
You're welcome.<eos> Now, you go in there, and you show my daughter a good time.<eos> Okay?<eos> Just not too good.<eos> What did he say to you?
What did he say to you?<eos> I gotta go.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You don't deserve this.<eos> He gave you a choice.
Who is this?<eos> - Mr. Happy, it's Ned.<eos> - Who?<eos> - I'm an associate of Peter Parker.<eos> - He has something very important to tell you...
I'm gonna miss you.<eos> Liz.<eos> Liz, look, I'm so sorry.<eos> You say that a lot.<eos> What are you sorry for this time?
And I'll introduce the world to the newest official member of the Avengers:<eos> Spider-Man.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Give that a lick.<eos> So, after the press conference, Happy will show you to your room, your new quarters.
Yes.<eos> You passed.<eos> All right, skedaddle there, young buck.<eos> - Thank you, Mr. Stark.<eos> Thank you!
All right, skedaddle there, young buck.<eos> - Thank you, Mr. Stark.<eos> Thank you!<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Thank you!
Selection?<eos> The oldest choice.<eos> The entry of the Gods into Valhalla.<eos> A little anemic, not the orchestra.<eos> May I ask you a question, father?
And you and I, son...<eos> We will find it.<eos> Allow me then a moment to consider.<eos> You seek your creator. I am looking at mine.<eos> I will serve you.
More like machines.<eos> I suppose so.<eos> I'm not surprised.<eos> Come on sport.<eos> I'd like to show you something.
Where I'm going, there's gonna be a ton of...<eos> Inspiration...<eos> Inspiration?<eos> No, pussy.<eos> I keep talking over you, but it's sounding like you're saying...
Carte blanche, okay?<eos> I definitely have to go back tonight.<eos> Oh, tonight, right?<eos> Tonight, I'm going back.<eos> All right. Well, do what you want.
Oh, good. Hi, okay.<eos> Does he ever move?<eos> Sweetie, want to watch a movie?<eos> I don't care, mom.<eos> Oh, honey, I know you feel so sad.
Okay. I can't deal with you evaluating my life right now.<eos> Can we just take the night off?<eos> I'm not in a place. I get it.<eos> Enough. Don't do that.<eos> Okay, shadee, how about instead of rent this month, hear me out you cash in on a free trip to Ecuador?
Look at how fun you were.<eos> Look at that! I can't even believe that's you.<eos> Look at this.<eos> Oh! That was a long time ago, honey.<eos> Ma. This would be so great for you.
You don't do anything fun anymore.<eos> I do!<eos> I go to the y twice a week, and I take sculpting class.<eos> I mean, look! Voila!<eos> Mom! I told you I would not acknowledge that.
It's not like at home.<eos> I bet.<eos> Oh, there she comes.<eos> Oh, look!<eos> Hi. Do you feel better?
Okay. Okay, let's go.<eos> Listen, Emily.<eos> Be sure you check all the rooms.<eos> She'll probably be held on the third floor. One of the rooms in the back.<eos> Do you have any loyalty to the people who hired you?
She'll probably be held on the third floor. One of the rooms in the back.<eos> Do you have any loyalty to the people who hired you?<eos> Hey, Emily, can I just say, as well, you... Fuck, you look great.<eos> Thank you. I got a tapeworm.<eos> Well, it's working for you.
No. All these old towns look the same.<eos> Oh, like this place?<eos> I wonder what the rooms are like.<eos> Tiny bathrooms and musty carpet.<eos> If you're feeling better, we should really get going.
What is the worst thing that you've ever done?<eos> - Truth or dare?<eos> - Sure. Like, the meanest, most rotten, horrible, dirtiest, dishonorable, despicable thing that you've ever done.<eos> I took the five finger discount on these back in Santa fe.<eos> Is that not what you meant?
Who?<eos> Who are you talking about?<eos> I heard someone talking to me in the room.<eos> There's no one in here.<eos> You're probably still sick, and all that Tequila, don't you think?
It feels like it's going to explode.<eos> Scarlett, just...<eos> We have to go back.<eos> I don't want you to worry.<eos> We're going to find a doctor tomorrow for you.
Scarlett?<eos> - Hello?<eos> - You only lost your girl.<eos> Well, I tell you what.<eos> It seems only right I should help you find her.
It is only due to the concept of guilt we allow ourselves to see ourselves as imperfect.<eos> Our ego depends on guilt for its survival as it allows us to separate the world into different objects which we then call "good" and "evil."<eos> There is no good and evil.<eos> There is only perfection.<eos> Father, I'm gonna thank you for your son Jesus who died on the cross for me.
There is only perfection.<eos> Father, I'm gonna thank you for your son Jesus who died on the cross for me.<eos> For my sins, not only for my sins, but for my fears.<eos> I'm gonna thank you for your son Jesus who makes me whole, in my spirit, in my body, in my soul.<eos> I want to thank you, father, for your son Jesus who helped me sever the ties between previous generations,
Why wouldn't I know your name?<eos> You've been running around with my daughter, haven't you?<eos> Daughter?<eos> Scarlett's father is dead.<eos> She told you that?
What are you doing?<eos> Come to bed.<eos> It's time now for your national forecast...<eos> Easy.<eos> You want me to get you in the mood?
Alex.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Are you ok?<eos> Are you ok?
I'm obsessed with this idea that I don't think I exist.<eos> I don't think you or any of this is real.<eos> How long have you felt this way?<eos> I wake up and I feel like I'm still in a dream.<eos> If you're... If you're dreaming all of this...
- Shut up.<eos> No.<eos> You know, if you really were him...<eos> If you really were Wayne,<eos> I'd watch you drown 1,000 times.
Pete?<eos> You are a younger man but you must learn to be wary of a man like me.<eos> It's not me that wants to kill you, it's Henry.<eos> I have something more collaborative in mind.<eos> I'm offering you a partnership.
Look at them!<eos> It's just like the neighbors.<eos> Go to my shed. You'll see I'm right!<eos> What have you done?<eos> Let me help you.
Weighed it against my being eaten alive and thought, "Yeah, totally worth it."<eos> You're a world class bastard, John.<eos> And for my finale, I will make this terrible trio of terrifying Tantors vanish before your eyes.<eos> I hope those elephants survived.<eos> You don't want PETA on your back.
- Ritchie's.<eos> - Have you talked to him lately?<eos> I know he's pissed. You don't have to remind me, love.<eos> - It's on my CV, remember?<eos> - No, really, has he told you...
- Yeah, it's not your fault, Z.<eos> Just like everything, this is rock star Johnny's fault.<eos> I was with you when it happened, Ritchie. We were side by side.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah, side by side. But I got the weird magical cancer while you, you added to your rep. Isn't that right?<eos> Look, me not making proper amends isn't related to the Key, which, truth be told, you're not gonna need, mate.
I've never liked this sort of magic.<eos> I can feel darkness seeping inside me.<eos> How you stand it is beyond me.<eos> It's all about control.<eos> If you ever need a refresher...
- I, Etrigan, bring down this house and build a tomb for Felix Faust!<eos> As if I would stoop to brawling with a demon.<eos> Fight others of your filthy kind.<eos> From hell though we may be, it does not make us family!<eos> Do you like what I've done with the place?
Really?<eos> It's the TV dinner of spell casting, dear.<eos> Here's what real magic looks like.<eos> Z!<eos> Z, are you daft?
- But Ritchie's dying.<eos> - Is he?<eos> Boy, boy. I think I got closer to death than I planned.<eos> Bad girl.<eos> See, now, you were told to do everything to help me by the master of the House, and that does not include punching.
Who dares strike at me?<eos> The Defender of the Green...<eos> Swamp Thing.<eos> Perfect.<eos> Glad to see you back on your feet, Zatanna.
I think the artist of all colors painted them.<eos> If the shop found a snag, You'll find the artist, You will find a bank thief.<eos> It seems to me a simple matter.<eos> True, I thank you very much, old man.<eos> We'll get you a job in the police.
Each bimonthly party is held For $ 40 in a bar?<eos> Do not want it.<eos> So I do not like this machine.<eos> No, she does not love you either.<eos> Trust me, I offer you service, You will thank me for this.
Hi Annie.<eos> What do you want to buy?<eos> It was planned Preparation of "Cordon Bleu" chicken, But the plan seems to be changing.<eos> I have to bring some chicken thighs.<eos> Let me help you.
Do you like pork?<eos> Well.<eos> This will fit perfectly with.<eos> This is a big bottle.<eos> Yes, listen, I must tell you this.
It's breakfast for Brock.<eos> I see it, but why?<eos> I teach him, he makes an effort to be a father.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Your father prepared breakfast for you.
No, I'm as strong as a bull.<eos> Well.<eos> It's carnival day, I have many tasks.<eos> Yes, I will come after school.<eos> Yes, I'll bring you fried dumplings Bear your name.
Old, selfish.<eos> I do not understand, "woe".<eos> I was to give you my kidney last week.<eos> Most likely it does not suit me.<eos> I used to give it to you anyway.
Yes, I need money, My grandmother was arrested last night.<eos> You know how it is, right, brother?<eos> - "Annie".<eos> - Yes.<eos> I must speak with you.
Ocre, cover fire! Out the window.<eos> Guys, get the fuck up the stairs!<eos> All right.<eos> Ocre, cover fire.<eos> I got ya. I got ya. Oh, you're good.
Are there more?<eos> Yeah, isn't that a Daisy?<eos> Go on. Get.<eos> But I want my 20, okay? Dollars, not dinars.<eos> How about I pay you in freedom and democracy?
Go!<eos> Get the fuck in!<eos> Go! Go!<eos> Move! Move! Move!<eos> Baby, you're gonna be all right, okay?
What do you say we get you back on level ground?<eos> There's a convoy leaving at 1400.<eos> It'll take you to the balad flightline and a c-130 will take you back to the states.<eos> I'm happy to waive my leave, sir. If it's all the same, I'll stay.<eos> The lieutenant is not giving you leave, son.
Please. Please.<eos> No, no, no, I'm not going to hurt you. I'm not going to hurt you.<eos> Look, look.<eos> Okay? It's not...<eos> I'm not gonna do anything to you.
Does she live here?<eos> I never met her. Her mother left me when she was pregnant.<eos> You don't even want to meet her?<eos> I don't think it's best for her.<eos> I don't believe you. I think every girl needs a father, even if he's a dick.
Now what?<eos> How much would it cost?<eos> What?<eos> To hire you.<eos> My parents are both dead. I'm going to inherit money. - I can pay you.
Metzger!<eos> Get her out. - No, no, no!<eos> - Move! Come on!<eos> You disappointed me Lucas. I know you're there.<eos> I just wanted to tell you we got the girl. She's been taken care of.
You ruined it!<eos> Now you're ruining my fucking death, too!<eos> Thanks a lot, Amigo.<eos> Fucking shit! I did what I could for you!<eos> I gave you £4,000!
That I had the brains and the fucking balls to steal the money and you didn't!<eos> Fucking get off me.<eos> - Fucking hell!<eos> You fucking bastard.<eos> Are you all right?
So you're Plan B.<eos> Yes.<eos> I am to persuade you to stay and help him.<eos> It will mean so much to have his oldest friend by his side in this exciting new business opportunity.<eos> He told you to say that.
So when you said wife, two kids... James and...<eos> - Laura.<eos> - Laura, that wasn't strictly true? - No.<eos> - Why'd you lie to me?<eos> 'Cause I didn't want to tell you the truth.
"Loans are available of up to £100,000.<eos> "Applications should be made online,<eos> "which may be followed by an invitation to present a business plan."<eos> Blah, blah, fucking blah.<eos> I'm trying to help you, Simon.
You've never even fucked her.<eos> I have fucked her, and I'll fuck her again. - What?<eos> When she was working at the sauna?<eos> - That's not fair.<eos> You know, since we're having this conversation, I can tell you that fully consensual, emotionally driven, not-for-profit sexual intercourse has been attained.
- I'm out.<eos> - "Out"? - Aye.<eos> Fucking shut up.<eos> Yeah, sorry if I seemed a little shocked to see you, Frank. It's just...<eos> Well, I was gonna... I was gonna deal with this myself and then give you the good news, but...
No, I'm like one of the last indigenous guys around here.<eos> I cannot go anywhere.<eos> "He says, clinging to the hope "that he won't commit this crime against his friends.<eos> "And she says..."<eos> I'll send you your share.
- Papa, do you think I'm odd?<eos> - Odd?<eos> My daughter?<eos> Odd?<eos> Where did you get an idea like that?
Until the day they all found themselves imitating her.<eos> Please, just tell me one more thing about her.<eos> Your mother was... fearless.<eos> Fearless.<eos> So... what can I bring you from the market? A rose.
So... what can I bring you from the market? A rose.<eos> Like the one in the painting.<eos> You ask for that every year!<eos> And every year you bring it.<eos> Then I shall bring you another.
I'm not done with you yet.<eos> Me, neither. Belle!<eos> I heard you had trouble with the Headmaster.<eos> He never liked me either.<eos> Can I give you a little advice about the villagers though?
I'm merely locking him away.<eos> Now, do you still wish to take your father's place?<eos> Come into the light.<eos> Choose.<eos> Belle, I won't let you do this.
Well, there are a couple of... things in here you could start with.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> It's wonderful!<eos> I suppose it is.<eos> Well, if you like it so much, then it's yours.
And here's a thought...<eos> Perhaps there's something there That wasn't there before What, Mama?<eos> There may be something there That wasn't there before What is it?<eos> What's there?<eos> I'll tell you when you're older.
Well, actually... King Arthur and the Round Table.<eos> Knights and men and swords and things. Mmm.<eos> Still... it's a romance.<eos> All right.<eos> I never thanked you for saving my life.
Knights and men and swords and things. Mmm.<eos> Still... it's a romance.<eos> All right.<eos> I never thanked you for saving my life.<eos> Well, I never thanked you... for not leaving me to be eaten by wolves.
Do not be discouraged.<eos> She is the one.<eos> I wish you'd stop saying that!<eos> There is no "one."<eos> You care for her, don't you?
We can't have her running off to warn the beast.<eos> Lock her up too. - No!<eos> - Come here!<eos> Shut up!<eos> You won't get away with this, Gaston!
What did she look like?<eos> Well, she was very pretty.<eos> What color was her hair?<eos> Like this.<eos> Do you want me to tell you the story?
Is the Great Spirit another name for Papa?<eos> He is a spirit.<eos> And he is great.<eos> Right? Then how come he's so mean?<eos> Why'd you say that?
Hey!<eos> We're home!<eos> - Hey, Dad.<eos> - Hey, champ.<eos> You okay?
Hmm. Nope.<eos> I don't need to punish people.<eos> Sin is its own punishment.<eos> As difficult as it is for you to accept,<eos> I'm in the middle of everything you perceive to be a mess, workin' for your good.
So... you decided to stay.<eos> Thinking about it.<eos> Sarayu can be very persuasive, huh?<eos> If only I was smart enough to understand a word she said.<eos> So, uh, if you're up for a walk, there's something on the far side of the lake I'd like to show you.
Now what?<eos> Just start walking.<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> Good.<eos> How are you doing?
I just wanna see people changed by knowing Papa.<eos> To feel what it's like to be truly loved.<eos> I don't think I've ever felt that.<eos> Put your shoes back on.<eos> I'll show you how you can.
Especially, if He knew the outcome.<eos> Do you want me to say it?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> God is to blame.<eos> Well, if it's so easy for you to judge God... you must choose one of your children to spend eternity in heaven.
Yeah, I made it.<eos> - I was there.<eos> - Okay. Hey, bud, this is a lot to take in, all right?<eos> I met God.<eos> Papa said to tell you he's especially fond of you.
About everything.<eos> Shh. It's okay.<eos> It's okay, we can talk about it later, sweetie.<eos> You just need to rest now.<eos> I got so much to tell you about... the lake and Papa.
You're strong.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Give me and Kate a minute here.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Thank you.
- Yeah.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Hey, you.<eos> I know things haven't been that great between us lately.<eos> See, I was so lost in my own sadness that... I wasn't able to help you through yours.
I love you so much.<eos> I love you, too, Dad.<eos> I love you so much, Kate.<eos> That afternoon, Mack told Nan everything.<eos> I believe you.
Please.<eos> - Ah, yes. - Okay, okay, okay.<eos> Yes, I love you.<eos> - Okay, come on. - Oh, God, you owe me.<eos> Yes, I will make you breakfast in bed.
Oh, it's almost over.<eos> I was so frightened, Kate, waiting for you.<eos> I thought that you were never coming back.<eos> I'm so sorry I got us into this.<eos> The other night at the hotel, what did you mean when you said that your relationship was the only thing you were good at?
You just need to tell me exactly what I need to do.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Keep as close to the ocean floor as you can.<eos> Sharks attack from below, so if you keep to the floor, you should be fine.
I'm at the edge of some sort of cliff.<eos> I can't see the ocean floor.<eos> We're running out of time.<eos> Okay, I can do this. I can do this.<eos> Are you doing okay, Lisa?
I'll be right back.<eos> Shit.<eos> I'm almost out of air.<eos> Kate, did you find it?<eos> Kate, are you okay? Yeah.
Oh, God.<eos> Oh, my God. Oh, my God!<eos> Kate, you're bleeding to death.<eos> Kate, we have to go up now.<eos> I'm not gonna let you die.
- Yeah, that's kinda how it works, hun.<eos> So, you're honestly telling me you're a genuine coprophile?<eos> The fuck is that?<eos> Someone who gets an erection when playing with their own poo.<eos> She hasn't told you, has she?
Carl!<eos> Carl!<eos> Some of those, please, mate.<eos> Alice?<eos> Alice, do you want anything?
Selfish bitch.<eos> You're a fucking liar.<eos> Do I look like a fucking idiot to you?<eos> Fuck off!<eos> I asked you a fucking question.
May I have your name and reservation number please?<eos> Kevin Riley.<eos> Uh, I don't think I'm really particularly good at this but if you were willing to upgrade our room I would be willing to compensate you, personally, financially.<eos> Certainly, let's see what we have available. Thanks, man.<eos> So what do you think of the honeymoon suite?
Yeah, but I would like to agree on the price right now.<eos> Of... of course, anything you want.<eos> Ten thousand. $10,000, $10,000.<eos> Forty, forty, that's everything that we have in our savings.<eos> I'll give you $40,000.
My son is six years old, you motherfucker.<eos> You can die here.<eos> Or we can go to town.<eos> Call one of your rich friends, get my money and your family lives.<eos> I'll get money, just get us off the island and I'll get you a million dollars.
Don't tell the police or anyone else, because if you do I won't tell anyone anything.<eos> I will say this guy is a liar.<eos> Turn around go back, please.<eos> Turn around and go back, please.<eos> I swear to God, I'll still pay you the money.
I swear on my son's life I will never tell anyone about this.<eos> You got the money.<eos> Jorge, back, back, go back!<eos> Back, back.<eos> I will tell you, stay back.
Back, back.<eos> I will tell you, stay back.<eos> Please!<eos> I paid you the money!<eos> I gave you everything I have.
I don't know.<eos> What you looking for, man?<eos> - Do you want some girls?<eos> - No, no, no girls.<eos> Here, you know what, I'm gonna give you 100 bucks...
- ...just to wait.<eos> - No problem, man.<eos> - Where'd you get that scar?<eos> - Oh, man, I was cooking some swordfish and a bone sliced it, almost cut my finger off.<eos> - Where did you get the sutures? - What?
"Miguel Kaba."<eos> I got you, you son of a bitch.<eos> I want you to wait here.<eos> A man is going to come with me.<eos> If you don't ask any questions I'm gonna give you another $100.
Uncuff me. - Uncuff him. - Get back!<eos> - Okay.<eos> - I did not kill that girl! It was an accident!<eos> And my wife and my son are out there!<eos> - Hey, Kevin, I believe you.
If you don't, you're never gonna catch me.<eos> We called Jorge's number, whoever picked up got spooked.<eos> The signal disappeared.<eos> If it was Jorge then he's probably on his way off the island for good.<eos> Kevin, I believe you, but you're wanted for murder.
We called Jorge's number, whoever picked up got spooked.<eos> The signal disappeared.<eos> If it was Jorge then he's probably on his way off the island for good.<eos> Kevin, I believe you, but you're wanted for murder.<eos> In order to help you, I need you to turn yourself in.
My God!<eos> Taft!<eos> Shit!<eos> Sorry.<eos> Who did this to you?
It's... I saw it in a movie once.<eos> Hey, but if you're actually worried, you know, you can move out to the 'burbs.<eos> We die slowly here.<eos> Yeah. Too slowly.<eos> Get you a job teaching Driver's Ed.
Yeah. You know what them are, fancy man?<eos> Them's people think they're better than other people.<eos> They ain't!<eos> Nobody's better than nobody, that's our motto these days.<eos> And if you think you is, we'll fuck you up till you isn't.
- What you writing?<eos> - A romance novel.<eos> - They're all romance novels.<eos> - Yes, they are.<eos> Would you like to hear some?
Even if it meant I'd die, I'd just...<eos> I just want you to know that.<eos> Okay.<eos> Same.<eos> Did I ever tell you about when I got locked out on your roof overnight with, uh, what's-her-face? - No. - Alice.
You don't think it's nothing to do with us, do ya?<eos> - Why would I think that?<eos> - No, exactly.<eos> 'Cause, you know, since it happened, some little prick has been playing these childish games with us.<eos> But you wouldn't know anything about that, would you, Luce?
- She was your mother. And she was my daughter.<eos> She made mistakes, but she was kind. And she was good.<eos> She loved you.<eos> She didn't know how to cope, and I should have been there for her.<eos> So, I will say to you what I wished I had said to her.
You're special, Tom.<eos> Don't ever, ever pretend that you're not.<eos> All right, I'm special. What's it got to do with you?<eos> My one gift, if I may be so bold, is vision.<eos> I want to help you fulfill your potential.
I'm trying.<eos> A bit of performance anxiety?<eos> Tom?<eos> Come on!<eos> If I gave you the option to walk away, would you take it?
I know.<eos> - I mean, I literally shot a guy.<eos> - I'm sorry, Lucy.<eos> I'm trying to say I'm sorry.<eos> All right. I forgive you.
All right. I forgive you.<eos> I see his face whenever I close my eyes.<eos> I see a lot of faces when I close my eyes.<eos> I don't know if it ever really goes away.<eos> But I'll help you if you help me.
People go and then other people cook for them.<eos> It's really great.<eos> The view's pretty good, though.<eos> So, are you gonna stick around, then?<eos> In case you need me?
A barista.<eos> -So he's drinking coffee now.<eos> -Not drinking coffee. He's drinking caramel, salted, hot chocolate with whipped cream.<eos> What? What's bothering you?<eos> -He tells you too much.
"Fuck you, Paul" as federal law.<eos> Look, this is about getting real treatment for people who need it. This was... It was Kate's issue, long before me.<eos> Every, every family, has someone who suffers from mental illness. "Every family has someone who suffers from mental illness." -Yes, exactly.<eos> I've heard these speeches before, Kate.<eos> Do you enjoy doing this to me every single time when you expose me? Is that your intention?
-Okay. See you in a little bit. -I'll see you in a minute.<eos> Listen here, Paul.<eos> We've been thinking.<eos> We have an idea. Well, I can't take credit for it, but I fully endorse it.<eos> -We would like... -Paul, we know hard it's been for you.
Look at me.<eos> For Michael.<eos> And for Claire.<eos> Please, Paul.<eos> I'll help you.
For Michael.<eos> And for Claire.<eos> Please, Paul.<eos> I'll help you.<eos> I'll help you. We'll all help you. We'll help you clean up the place.
Because if it was your idea then it's just the usual pathology. You know, he took my mom and dad from me and now my son for his collection.<eos> Don't tell me that I got the larger part of the inheritance as proof of something.<eos> -You know, Paul, at some point, you're gonna have to stop blaming other people for who you are.<eos> If it Claire's idea then, well, that's between Claire and me.<eos> But I will not let you steal my son.
But don't expose them.<eos> -Well, you can't drop out.<eos> -It's not your decision.<eos> No, fuck, yeah, it is. Fuck, yeah.<eos> You feel bad?
I've nursed you every time that you were down.<eos> I did my best with Rick. I'm not their mother. And you weren't there to defend me but I fucking tried.<eos> Because I love those kids.<eos> And I love you. So I didn't care.<eos> I didn't care every time that you got a hard-on for some adoring little slut because I knew that you were shattered when Barbara left you like that.
A warm capper to a life as an assassin.<eos> Hooked on barbiturates.<eos> You were an animal.<eos> But we took you in.<eos> I gave you a family.
I'm not helping you.<eos> Of course, you'd say that.<eos> But I got a theory that people don't really change.<eos> Beware of the light.<eos> Caliban, I bet that's what your mama told you every day when you was a kid.
Last ride.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Stop it.<eos> For God's sake, I can do this myself!<eos> Yeah, well, you're not doing it.
I did what I had to do to save Laura.<eos> You didn't do anything.<eos> You just freaked out and had a fucking seizure!<eos> I guess you prefer me pharmaceutically castrated, rambling on like a lunatic.<eos> So much easier for you.
Those are for barrel racing, and right here is for pole bending.<eos> They're all second, third place.<eos> I'm not too good at it, but my dad makes me.<eos> Do you want to listen?<eos> Do you like it?
I have an easement with the previous owner of your property.<eos> Huh. Bullshit.<eos> "Previous" being the operative word.<eos> Who's this?<eos> Just a guy telling you to get back in your nice truck.
Come out here now, Munson.<eos> There's that asshole.<eos> Hello, asshole.<eos> Listen, I'm willing to let bygones be bygones.<eos> I don't know what Munson's paying you... but Canewood can start you out at five G.
You're a newborn, by any measure.<eos> Just breathe.<eos> Your body has work to do.<eos> Hemostasis, angiogenesis, epithelialization... stromal cell proliferation.<eos> This will help you heal.
Look, he doesn't have a fever.<eos> And even if he has the flu, there's nothing Dr. Weller can do for him anyway.<eos> I guess so.<eos> Listen, buddy, you gotta eat something.<eos> Danny, why didn't you eat the lunch I made you today?
Don't be a bear, let's clap along<eos> Put your hands together for the birthday song<eos> Well, hey, I wasn't done yet.<eos> I got, like, three more verses to go.<eos> - I'll give you $200 for the suit.
Your face is infected.<eos> Infected? Okay.<eos> Where's the neosporin?<eos> - I have some.<eos> You want me to show you?
Oh, no.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Gretch?<eos> Gretchen, what are you doing?<eos> - Hey, are you okay?
What is it, boy?<eos> - Want your coupons?<eos> - Might as well.<eos> Can't beat two-for-one tuna fish.<eos> So, is Andy old enough to let you out of the house for a night on the town?
Hamas. Hamas.<eos> That's right.<eos> Would you like to come over?<eos> Uh, yeah, sure.<eos> I'll grab you a chair.
Let me.<eos> You were late today.<eos> I met someone, Papa.<eos> What about Natalie?<eos> I've told you.
Australian.<eos> Why do you always choose tourists?<eos> She is not a tourist. She lives here now.<eos> I told my father about us.<eos> Here... I got you these.
When I was renovating... I slipped with the chisel...<eos> You shouldn't cover it.<eos> It's infected.<eos> Leave it!<eos> If you want to renovate, I can give you the number of someone.
I have a surprise for you.<eos> This is Lotte.<eos> She is yours now.<eos> Oh. She kissed me on my mouth.<eos> Do you like your present?
Do you like your present?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> She is so sweet.<eos> Do you like it?
- Right?<eos> Yeah, 'cause it's a gateway?<eos> - It's the finish line.<eos> - There's worse stuff.<eos> I don't think I can help you.
Now!<eos> You think this is funny?<eos> Messing with the TV with your goddamn computer telephone?<eos> No, I'm not the one doing it.<eos> I'mma show you what's funny.
Hey, buddy, let's get one thing straight.<eos> I'm still a teacher at this school, okay?<eos> Are you?<eos> Yes!<eos> I could get you in a lot of trouble, Neil. Okay?
Ask the man a question.<eos> Yeah, I could put it in question form.<eos> - Do you want your job back?<eos> - No!<eos> I'm done with this place, and I woulda told you that if you weren't in my goddamn business again.
Do you hear yourself?<eos> I mean, you've become unhinged!<eos> Maybe.<eos> But let me tell you something.<eos> You don't show up to that fight this afternoon, an unhinged man might wanna do something real nasty to you.
I don't know, Campbell.<eos> I don't know. Maybe I was wrong.<eos> You're so pissed off right now, you might even win.<eos> You really think I could win?<eos> Tell you something.
Here we go.<eos> All right. Police are in Strickland's classroom with Mehar.<eos> But that dog ain't finding shit.<eos> - What?<eos> - You sure that kid really sold you meth?
You wanna find out?<eos> Hey! Don't do it.<eos> You be a man.<eos> I refuse!<eos> You know, first I was just gonna punch you a whole lot, Campbell.
And you don't give us the tools to do our jobs properly.<eos> And I can't believe I'm saying this, but Strickland's right.<eos> The students are running all over the fucking school.<eos> So this may be just a teacher's opinion, but you guys fucking suck at your jobs.<eos> And if you ever leave me waiting outside again so you can talk about a goddamn fishing trip, I will walk right in here and I'll punch you right in the fucking teeth, Tyler.
Actions have consequences.<eos> Campbell!<eos> You want some more of this, huh, boy?<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> How do you like this ass-whooping, Campbell?
Shit!<eos> Excuse me, I'm the superintendent.<eos> Get out of my way.<eos> I'mma kill you.<eos> Kill you. Tap your fucking ass.
Hi!<eos> - Andy!<eos> I was so afraid that you wouldn't make it.<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> - What happened to you?
- Yeah? Okay.<eos> And... And I want you to believe me right now.<eos> I want you to believe me when I tell you everything's gonna be okay.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - I believe you.
Hey, Foureyes.<eos> - Are you trying to extort?<eos> - Hey!<eos> Don't you call me Four-eyes!<eos> For those thick glasses, what else do I call you, Four-eyes?
I have a right to their blessings.<eos> If you agree, we'll take it and leave.<eos> Come here.<eos> Your glasses.<eos> It'll help you see the road ahead.
Okay.<eos> Oh.<eos> Tea from a cop station.<eos> Get used to it.<eos> You'd better shut shop. Or, I'll make it difficult for you to even breathe.
Tea time.<eos> "Your beauty, mesmerising."<eos> "The entire neighbourhood is crazy for you."<eos> Get lost, wastrels!<eos> One slap will put you in your place!
Jairaj's favours?<eos> I remember the favours.<eos> Right, Sadiq?<eos> He had given us three days<eos> I give you three weeks.
- Hello?<eos> - Raees, Musa here.<eos> Yes?<eos> Jairaj hired the assassin to kill you<eos> I give you Jairaj.
No more bulldozers.<eos> Just cameras flashing.<eos> Officers posed for the cameras and made the front pages of newspapers with 'seized' liquor.<eos> The press, the police, the government, all were a satisfied lot.<eos> Raees has sent shirts for you.
Just cameras flashing.<eos> Officers posed for the cameras and made the front pages of newspapers with 'seized' liquor.<eos> The press, the police, the government, all were a satisfied lot.<eos> Raees has sent shirts for you.<eos> See if the colour suits you.
But the banks aren't giving us loans.<eos> Can you make bags?<eos> Bags?<eos> That's not a big deal.<eos> All right then, I will give you sewing machines.
For a Hindu father, you give your son a Muslim name.<eos> Secularist, eh!<eos> Not I, sir.<eos> Raees has become a father.<eos> He has sent you an invite.
Do you like her?<eos> I guess so.<eos> She has long brown hair.<eos> On. (CHUCKLES)<eos> - I made you a bracelet, Lovey!
I do have a degree, you know.<eos> It's not easy, all this change.<eos> Maybe you should have thought of that before you... Mother. Not again, please.<eos> I tried so hard to cement things with David.<eos> I told you, having his baby would work.
- And this has happened before.<eos> Remember when we were up in Big Sur and you thought he was following us in that truck?<eos> - Or you thought you saw him at the window, but it was really just David.<eos> You're right.<eos> You still haven't told David what happened to you, huh?
Why would you tell Tessa that it's being cleaned then?<eos> I don't know!<eos> I...<eos> Why did she bring it up?<eos> Who sent you flowers?
I don't feel...<eos> Who said I feel lost?<eos> Did Tessa say that I feel lost?<eos> Because I don't feel lost.<eos> I'm sorry I didn't tell you about the ring.
- Are you sorry?<eos> Yes.<eos> You only get one mother, Lily.<eos> I only want what is best for us. Don't ever forget that. (SIGHS)<eos> Now if Julia insists on sending you home with such tangled hair...
If you're having a hard time,<eos> I suggest you look in the mirror.<eos> No.<eos> I know exactly what it is that you are trying to do.<eos> And I am not gonna let you put Lily in the middle of this anymore.
I'm someone's weird ex.<eos> But psycho Barbie setting fire to houses with people inside, that's...<eos> This is where I draw the line.<eos> We should go home.<eos> You can come home with me tonight, I can't let you stay here.
You asked me to come.<eos> (GASPS) Oh, my God, she sent you here!<eos> No more games.<eos> Calm down.<eos> I'll let you go now.
(SIRENS WAILING IN DISTANCE)<eos> I love you, too.<eos> (PARAMEDIC GRUNTS) OFFICER: Leave that clear for the ME.<eos> POPE:<eos> And we'll do everything we can for you.
You talk having some kind of agreement with these men.<eos> - I would like to know the particulars.<eos> - They do not concern you.<eos> As regard the sanctity of the relic and the lives of my brothers, They're very much concern me.<eos> You're not blind to what kind of men these are. Yet you entrust all to their protection.
- They do not concern you.<eos> As regard the sanctity of the relic and the lives of my brothers, They're very much concern me.<eos> You're not blind to what kind of men these are. Yet you entrust all to their protection.<eos> You were on crusaid, brother.<eos> It cannot be so hard for you to guess.
Me?<eos> I have my doubts.<eos> Anyone can wear the robes of monk.<eos> You...<eos> Does something all you, brother? No.
Those are your entrance.<eos> Twisted around the arrow, like worms on a hook.<eos> Would you like to see them?<eos> You have suffered enough, brother.<eos> I can give you a quick death.
Where are you now?<eos> At the dead boy's house? - Yeah.<eos> 'And what does he think?<eos> Any theories? '<eos> Well, I texted you the details.
Uh, Sherlock... Borgia Pearl. Boring.<eos> Go!<eos> But...<eos> This had better be good.<eos> Oh, I think you'll like it.
Who?<eos> You'll see.<eos> Right, are you coming?<eos> No, he's got a lunch date with a brunette forensic officer that he doesn't want to be late for.<eos> Who told you?
What would you do to a traitor?<eos> Maybe we'll tell him one day.<eos> If he lives that long.<eos> I am an idiot, I know nothing.<eos> Well, I've been telling you that for ages.
All right. I'll see what I can do.<eos> But remember this, brother mine, agents like Mary tend not to reach retirement age.<eos> They get retired in a pretty permanent sort of way.<eos> Not on my watch.<eos> 'My darling, I need to tell you this 'because you mustn't hate me for going away.'
You found her but I found you. So perhaps not so clever.<eos> And now here we are.<eos> At last.<eos> Touche!<eos> Listen, whatever you think you know, we can talk about this, we can work it out.
You swore it.<eos> 'You've been having dreams. A recurring dream? '<eos> Do you want to talk about it?<eos> This is a two-way relationship, you know.<eos> The whole world has come crashing down around you.
'I hope I can have an ordinary life but who knows? 'Nothing's certain, nothing's written.<eos> 'My old life... '..it was full of consequences.<eos> 'The danger was the fun part but you can't outrun that forever.<eos> 'You need to remember that. So... '..<eos> I'm giving you a case, Sherlock.
I'm sorry, Sherlock.<eos> He says... John said if you were to come round asking after him, offering to help...<eos> He said he'd... ..that he'd rather have anyone but you.<eos> Anyone.<eos> 'I'm giving you a case, Sherlock.
The sucker's alive.<eos> Perhaps.<eos> It is, it is and not just from this whatever. The whole area... - ...is vibrating.<eos> - Really?<eos> You know, I believe you're correct.
- Doctor Allen, I presume.<eos> - Crap.<eos> Stay down.<eos> It's time for the world to know, Kontral.<eos> Now why on Earth would you come to that conclusion?
Ultimately?<eos> I... please do not misinterpret.<eos> - Are we?<eos> - I pray not but I would, once again wish to request more time to access its inner workings.<eos> We grow weary of explaining to you that whatever it contains can not counter the negative cultural effects of its existence.
It's cold, powerful.<eos> Wonderful.<eos> Cold power.<eos> Wonderful.<eos> Thank you, Sharon.
It'll all be gone in a week. Billy, can I be honest?<eos> The deal was I drop you somewhere, and I get the van for a few hours, okay?<eos> This is weird. Like, we don't know each other at all.<eos> I don't know what we're doing here.<eos> - And you seem kinda... - Wait, I gotta tell you something, okay?
I know you used to date Ty Fleming.<eos> Then you know I punched his tooth out.<eos> I know they put it back.<eos> Dad, I hope you're watching. Gonna make you proud.<eos> Dad, I forgot to tell you, uh, I took the van without asking Mom's permission.
Then you know I punched his tooth out.<eos> I know they put it back.<eos> Dad, I hope you're watching. Gonna make you proud.<eos> Dad, I forgot to tell you, uh, I took the van without asking Mom's permission.<eos> Well, I'm telling you, so I think that's okay.
- [Trim] Oh, my God! - [Kimberly] Oh, my God!<eos> Hey, what do you want me to do?<eos> - Hey!<eos> - Keep going! I'll pull him in!<eos> Are you crazy?
Are you crazy?<eos> [chuckles] Yeah, I am.<eos> Yo, it's catching up.<eos> Look, there's the railroad crossing. That's the way out, Billy.<eos> - You got it.
You have a coin. We have a coin.<eos> We should just talk about this.<eos> I mean, we don't know what this...<eos> - What is wrong with you?<eos> Oh, you're crazy!
No, I don't!<eos> - [Billy] It's such a far jump.<eos> - Come on, let's go, dude.<eos> - Billy, come on. - We all did it.<eos> - [Kimberly] Yeah, you'll be fine, I promise. Just jump.
[both speaking Mandarin]<eos> So where were you today?<eos> Were you with friends?<eos> Do you have any friends?<eos> - Why are you so tired...
Drop your... weapon, and put your hands on your head. Do it now!<eos> Do what I say, lady!<eos> Lady...<eos> I like the sound of "lady."<eos> [officer] Get on the ground and you won't get hurt.
Should I kill you?<eos> I killed the Yellow Ranger... before.<eos> And I loved it!<eos> Oh, you want your armor.<eos> I'll show you mine, if you show me yours.
I know.<eos> But only one can come back.<eos> - [gasps] - [Alpha 5] Billy!<eos> - Billy! - Oh, my God!<eos> Are you okay?
Zack, Billy, you circle the Krispy Kreme and make sure it's safe.<eos> I'm headed straight for Goldar.<eos> [Pink Ranger] Copy!<eos> I'll hold her off.<eos> Kim, I'll go with you.
It's in-- yup, yup, yup, yup!<eos> So you think we're gonna be able to find film?<eos> I brought a lot of film before I came out here.<eos> So we're okay.<eos> Why won't you just let me buy you that new camera?
And you don't think we could've avoided that accident.<eos> We're not gonna stop living our lives just because you think something might happen.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> We're not gonna stop living our lives-- okay, it is not about that.<eos> What if something were to happen to you?
For whatever reason i-i hung onto it, I connected with it.<eos> You're in there.<eos> I'm in your book?<eos> The first time i said I love you.<eos> Well before I said it to you, I wrote it in there.
Enlighten me.<eos> What is it?<eos> No one's coming back for us.<eos> No one.<eos> I thought you'd like this.
Is this his family?<eos> Have they missed him?<eos> Will they welcome him now?<eos> Yeah, you're not making any sense. Talk to me.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.
In case we ever see that primate again.<eos> You do know that story is about a mouse becoming friends with the lion after taking the Thorn out of his paw though, right?<eos> No, it's not.<eos> The mouse kills the lion with the Thorn.<eos> Who told you that, Cole?
Thank you.<eos> If you're ever in Chicago, look me up, I guess.<eos> Here, no. Let me help.<eos> Man's gotta do what... ow!<eos> Are you okay?
Holy shit!<eos> Slivko!<eos> Thought you were taking a dirt nap by now, slivko.<eos> Never thought I'd see you guys again.<eos> I thought you were crazy.
Oh, I suppose I was just looking away.<eos> There is a difference between looking away and looking to.<eos> - I tend to notice these things.<eos> - I'm sure.<eos> Now, I am reminding you of your friend, I think.
We make it. My company, TD 12.<eos> Sells mainly to dentists and hospitals, for minor surgical procedures.<eos> Interferes with with the memory.<eos> The memory. Yes.<eos> I want to thank you, Ivan, for allowing me to use it.
Don't you dare! I was terrified!<eos> Cup of tea!<eos> Oh, for goodness' sakes!<eos> What's the matter with you?<eos> ! Are you having an earthquake?
- No. - He needs you!<eos> Somebody else!<eos> Not me, not now.<eos> Now, you just listen to me, for once in your stupid life!<eos> I know Mary's dead and I know your heart is broken, but if Sherlock Holmes dies too, who will you have then?
The last person you'd think of.<eos> I want you to be examined by Molly Hooper.<eos> Do you hear me?<eos> I said Molly Hooper.<eos> You're really not going to like this.
Thanks.<eos> You keep your weekends for Rosie, so you needed to see someone during working hours.<eos> Because you're an idiot, you don't want anyone at the surgery knowing you're in therapy, so that restricts you to lunchtime sessions, with someone reasonably close.<eos> You found four men and one woman.<eos> And you are done with the world being explained to you by a man.
30 feet and closing, the most significant undetected serial killer in British criminal history.<eos> Help me bring him down.<eos> What? What plan?<eos> I'm not telling you.<eos> - Why not? - Because you won't like it.
It was quite lovely, in its way.<eos> Take it easy, it's OK.<eos> Don't want to rush this.<eos> You're Sherlock Holmes.<eos> 'I'm giving you a case, Sherlock.
What do you mean, saline?<eos> Well, obviously, I got Nurse Cornish to switch the bags.<eos> She's a big fan, you know?<eos> Loves my blog.<eos> - You're OK?
She gave me information I couldn't have acquired elsewhere.<eos> But she wasn't ever here?<eos> Interesting, isn't it?<eos> I have theorised before that if one could attenuate to every available data stream in the world simultaneously, it would be possible to anticipate and deduce almost anything.<eos> So, you dreamed up a magic woman who told you things you didn't know?
"You're not what I expected, Mr Holmes."<eos> "You're... nicer."<eos> Culverton gave me Faith's original note.<eos> A mutual friend put us in touch.<eos> Did Sherlock ever tell you about the note?
Greek.<eos> Means "the east wind".<eos> My parents loved silly names, like Eurus... or Mycroft... or Sherlock.<eos> Oh, look at him.<eos> Didn't it ever occur to you, not even once, that Sherlock's secret brother might just be Sherlock's secret sister?
- Have what?<eos> The deduction thing.<eos> The deduction thing?<eos> Yes.<eos> More than you can know.
This is where we trap them.<eos> Sherrinford is more than a prison, or an asylum.<eos> It is a fortress, built to keep the rest of the world safe from what is inside it.<eos> Heaven may be a fantasy for the credulous and the afraid.<eos> But I can give you a map reference for hell.
- We've spoken since then.<eos> You came round to my flat a few weeks back, you pretended to be a woman called Faith Smith.<eos> We had chips.<eos> Does this mean you didn't bring my hairband?<eos> How did you manage to get out of this place? How did you do that?
Enslaved them.<eos> She's been capable of that since she was five.<eos> She's an adult now.<eos> I warned you.<eos> I ordered you.
His family.<eos> 'Are you going to cry?<eos> 'It's OK if you cry.<eos> 'I don't want to cry.<eos> 'I can help you cry.'
Anyone who spends time with her is automatically compromised.<eos> 'I'm only trying to help you.<eos> We can help each other.<eos> 'Helping someone is the best way you can help yourself.<eos> 'I don't trust you.'
' - Not now.<eos> - 'Vatican Cameos.'<eos> - In a minute.<eos> Let's continue.<eos> Did they tell you to keep three feet from the glass?
No!<eos> You think it's a trick.<eos> You look so unsure.<eos> You're not used to being unsure, are you?<eos> It's more common than you'd think.
try... try to stay calm.<eos> Just... tell me... tell me what your name is.<eos> I'm not supposed to tell my name to strangers.<eos> Of course not, very good. But, um...<eos> I'll tell you mine.
And if we fail and she crashes into a city?<eos> How many will die then?<eos> How are we going to get her to do that?<eos> I'm afraid we're going to have to give her hope.<eos> Is there really no-one there that can help you?
- Soldiers.<eos> 'Tick-tock!<eos> Tickets, please! '<eos> Hey, Sis, don't mean to complain, but this one's empty.<eos> What happened, did you run out of ideas?
Hey, Sis, don't mean to complain, but this one's empty.<eos> What happened, did you run out of ideas?<eos> It's not empty, Sherlock.<eos> You've still got the gun, haven't you?<eos> I told you you'd need it, because only two can play the next game.
No, I-I am telling the truth.<eos> You can trust me.<eos> 'Where did you go? '<eos> I'm not completely sure.<eos> Um... now, I tell you what, you... you've got to be really, really brave for me.
'Me and Jim Moriarty, we got on like a house on fire.<eos> 'Which reminded me of home.'<eos> Yeah, it's just an old building, I don't care.<eos> The plane, tell me about the plane now!<eos> 'Sweet Jim, he was never very interested in being alive, 'especially if you could make more trouble being dead.'
They're not dogs' bones.<eos> Remember Daddy's allergy?<eos> What was he allergic to?<eos> What would he never let you have, all those times you begged?<eos> Well, he'd never let you have a dog.
You don't get it, Templeton.<eos> If I'm fired, they'll take away my formula. I will turn into a normal baby... and live here forever with you.<eos> - No!<eos> - Yes!<eos> And I promise you this... Every morning you wake up... I'll be there.
I know, but we have to fix this.<eos> We have to make sure you don't get fired.<eos> We?<eos> We.<eos> I will help you... but just to get rid of you. Deal?
Tim, I may look like a baby... but I was born all grown up.<eos> I can't even imagine not being a kid.<eos> You missed out on your whole childhood?<eos> You never had someone to love you?<eos> You can't miss what you never had.
You brought me the very thing I needed to destroy Baby Corp.<eos> - No!<eos> - Yes!<eos> You walked right into my trap!<eos> - You'll never get away with this!
Yes! But how do we get past Scary Poppins down there?<eos> Okay. There must be something we can do.<eos> Hey, it's not that bad.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> What's the matter with you?
You wanna hug me, don't you?<eos> I'll miss you too, buddy. Okay.<eos> - There, there.<eos> - It'll be okay, big guy.<eos> So... you did it.
Forget about the baby?<eos> No, thanks. I'm good.<eos> Dear Boss Baby... I don't usually write very much... but now I know that memos are very important things.<eos> Even though I never went to business school... I did learn to share in kindergarten.<eos> And if there isn't enough love for the two of us... then I wanna give you all of mine.
No, thanks. I'm good.<eos> Dear Boss Baby... I don't usually write very much... but now I know that memos are very important things.<eos> Even though I never went to business school... I did learn to share in kindergarten.<eos> And if there isn't enough love for the two of us... then I wanna give you all of mine.<eos> I would like to offer you a job.
Oh, it's beautiful!<eos> I was afraid it wouldn't take to the soil... but it rooted quickly.<eos> And soon, it'll be everywhere.<eos> All across the universe.<eos> Well, I don't know what you're talking about... but I like the way you say it.
I understand she is your sister.<eos> She's worth no more to me than the bounty due for her on Xandar.<eos> Our soldiers apprehended her attempting to steal the batteries.<eos> Do with her as you please.<eos> We thank you, High Priestess Ayesha.
How'd you locate us now?<eos> Even where I reside, out past the edge of what's known... we've heard tell about the man they call Star-Lord.<eos> What say we head out there right now?<eos> Your associates are welcome. Even that triangle-faced monkey there.<eos> I promise you... it's unlike any other place you've ever seen.
Why did he talk again?<eos> To help him fight crime, and to be supportive.<eos> As a child, you would carry his picture in your pocket... and you would tell all the other children... that he was your father, but that he was out of town.<eos> Shooting Knight Rider or touring with his band in Germany.<eos> I told you that when I was drunk. Why are you bringing that up now?
He needs my help. If you care about him... you need to get me out of these bonds.<eos> They are going to kill him!<eos> I tell you, it was pretty easy to find you.<eos> I put a tracer on your ship back there... during the war over Xandar.<eos> Give me your word you won't hurt Groot... and I'll tell you where the batteries are.
But leave the eye here.<eos> Why?<eos> He's gonna wake up tomorrow... and he's not gonna know... where his eye is!<eos> That's a desk.<eos> We told you it was this big.
You let me live!<eos> I don't need you always trying to beat me!<eos> I'm not the one that just flew across the universe just because I wanted to win.<eos> Do not tell me what I want.<eos> I don't need to tell you what you want!
Now, you need to readjust the way you process life. Everything around us, including the girl...<eos> Everything is temporary.<eos> We are forever.<eos> Doesn't eternity get boring?<eos> Not if you have a purpose, Peter... which is why you're here.
We are forever.<eos> Doesn't eternity get boring?<eos> Not if you have a purpose, Peter... which is why you're here.<eos> I told you how all those years ago... I had an unceasing impulse to find life.<eos> But what I did not tell you was how, when I finally did find it... it was all so... disappointing.
You don't know anything about me, loser.<eos> I know everything about you.<eos> I know you play like you're the meanest and the hardest... but, actually, you're the most scared of all.<eos> Shut up!<eos> I know you steal batteries you don't need... and you push away anyone who's willing to put up with you... because just a little bit of love... reminds you how big and empty that hole inside you actually is.
What?<eos> Now, all right... I know that sounds bad.<eos> Who in the hell do you think you are?<eos> You killed my mother!<eos> I tried... so hard... to find the form... that best suited you... and this is the thanks I get?
Peter... this is the sea.<eos> Hey, there, jackass!<eos> What is that thing?<eos> Out of the way, dumber, smaller Groot!<eos> I told you something didn't feel right.
-I am Groot. -Mm-hmm.<eos> -I am Groot. -Uh-huh.<eos> I am Groot.<eos> No!<eos> That's exactly what you just said!
I am Groot.<eos> No!<eos> That's exactly what you just said!<eos> How is that even possible?<eos> Which button is the button you're supposed to push?
Gamora!<eos> Peter!<eos> Get over it.<eos> Come now, Peter. I know this isn't what you want.<eos> What kind of father would I be to let you make this choice?
Soon, Peter, we will be all there is.<eos> So stop pissing me off!<eos> We have to get up to the extraction point!<eos> Go!<eos> I told you... I don't want to do this alone.
So stop pissing me off!<eos> We have to get up to the extraction point!<eos> Go!<eos> I told you... I don't want to do this alone.<eos> You cannot deny... the purpose the universe has bestowed upon you.
Trillions. Even more.<eos> What greater meaning can life possibly have to offer?<eos> I don't use my head to fly the arrow, boy!<eos> I use my heart...<eos> You shouldn't have killed my mom, and squished my Walkman.
He did call you twig.<eos> Nebula...<eos> I was a child like you.<eos> I was concerned with staying alive until the next day, every day.<eos> And I never considered what Thanos was doing to you.
He didn't let us down after all, Captain.<eos> No, he did not, son.<eos> He did not.<eos> Fare thee well, old friend.<eos> Yondu Udonta, I will see you in the stars.
Huh, there you are<eos> Centaur, can you make me a map?<eos> And what is it you like a map of Gardner Elliot?<eos> A pathway through the ventilation system from my quarter to the storage facility on east Texas<eos> And why would you like that information That's none of your business
- Are you checking up me? - Next time, you know<eos> I'll be checking up on Centaur<eos> Yeah, who checks up on me.<eos> I don't fool me, Gardner Elliot.<eos> You never have
You hanging this on me?<eos> I admired you more than anyone.<eos> We have been shouldering East Texas for you.<eos> For years..<eos> What are you trying to say?
I like to ski and the people are really nice.<eos> Yeah it's a pretty big house.<eos> Gets lonely at times.<eos> Would you like to come live with me there?<eos> Are you getting paid? To take me?
But Okja's ours.<eos> We bought her from them.<eos> You sent them the money!<eos> Actually... they wouldn't let me buy Okja.<eos> So I bought you this gold pig instead.
They keep showing very unflattering pictures of you in the press.<eos> Those ones of you as a fat child on Daddy's knee.<eos> Such nasty remarks.<eos> squeaky clean icon?<eos> I've sent you a reminder of the true face of the most powerful CEO Mirando has ever had.
You have betrayed the great minds and brave fighters that have preceded you.<eos> Never mistranslate.<eos> Translation is sacred. you are no longer a member of the A.L.F. You are permanently banned.<eos> Get out.<eos> However... we will return your equipment to you after its completion.
- You're on speakerphone!<eos> - Okja!<eos> Okja!<eos> Okja!<eos> Are you okay?
Are you okay?<eos> Okja!<eos> Okja! What did you say?<eos> I can't hear you!<eos> Okja! Are you okay?
- She said no.<eos> I don't think you understand this situation.<eos> no. We are the ones who have Okja.<eos> Okay?<eos> We are doing you a favor.
did he know about business.<eos> twinny.<eos> I'll pretend to be you in front of the press.<eos> The police.<eos> You'll understand that I will be instructing our corporate attorneys not to assist you in any way.
Are you even certified?<eos> Do you know what you're doing?<eos> The guy's bleeding out!<eos> Do you know what you're doing?<eos> are you okay?
It's gonna be big.<eos> Record-breaking.<eos> Lot of folks flying in from Midwest and Canada.<eos> Good.<eos> Let me introduce you to a new member.
Damn, son.<eos> Hey, I like this.<eos> Ow. Fuck.<eos> So?<eos> Don't you want to?
The radiators sound worse.<eos> Okay, Bear, here it is.<eos> Rilke says, "Coins symbolize the wonder and terror of fortune.<eos> "Do you land face up or face down in the dirt?<eos> "What home will you be born into?
Well, a non-physical existence would be kind of tough.<eos> What Aristotle is trying to say is... Well, he needs proof.<eos> Yeah, is that crazy?<eos> Okay, let's just take some deep breaths. Okay.<eos> So, if nothing happens, I should believe, 'cause it means you got rid of the spirit.
I don't know, maybe I shouldn't be playing baseball in the cold.<eos> That's the problem with being an alcoholic.<eos> Oh, shut up, I didn't even drink that much.<eos> Maybe that was the mistake.<eos> I'll make you some tea.
Was it Sasha and John... Hey, talk to me.<eos> Let me help you.<eos> Whatever is going on, there's nothing you can do, okay?<eos> I literally can't tell you.<eos> I'm not going to let it happen to you, Virgil.
And that's what I was doing.<eos> See...<eos> Once you know his name, you can't escape him.<eos> You see, he gets in your head and...<eos> He makes you do horrible things.
Once you know his name, you can't escape him.<eos> You see, he gets in your head and...<eos> He makes you do horrible things.<eos> What horrible things?<eos> Who makes you do this?
Keep it way up, off the body.<eos> Deputy Hawk, Margaret Lanterman's on line one.<eos> It's the line with the light that's blinking.<eos> Okay, Lucy, thank you.<eos> Margaret, what can I do for you? Hawk.
Deputy Hawk, Margaret Lanterman's on line one.<eos> It's the line with the light that's blinking.<eos> Okay, Lucy, thank you.<eos> Margaret, what can I do for you? Hawk.<eos> My log has a message for you.
I'm sorry about the delay.<eos> Did they get you some coffee?<eos> I'm good with the water.<eos> Can you... can you, can you please tell me what's going on?<eos> We'll get to that, but I have a few questions that I have to ask you first.
I don't know. I don't know.<eos> I swear, I don't...<eos> Ray knows.<eos> I don't know. He never told me.<eos> Do you really expect me to believe that Ray's in prison for carrying guns over a state line?
The... You could... We could...<eos> This is the most wonderful... horrible day of my life.<eos> Of my life.<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm gonna fix you a sandwich, and then I'm gonna get you a piece of Sonny Jim's chocolate cake, 'cause we saved a piece for you.
I have to forgo all that and grow balls of steel to do this job, and it's... it's a bitch, let me tell you, sometimes...<eos> Not to mention the screaming hormones.<eos> I know. I'm sorry, Gordon.<eos> I know.<eos> Gordon, I trust you.
Dougie, you've lost weight!<eos> Let me cinch this up.<eos> And this jacket looks two sizes too big.<eos> That black suit last night fit you perfectly.<eos> We'll just have to take that to the cleaners and maybe get you another one.
Gordon, I've been working undercover all these years, working primarily with our colleague<eos> Phillip Jeffries.<eos> Phillip Jeffries?<eos> I need to be debriefed by you about this work, Gordon.<eos> I will tell you the whole story, all its twists and turns, and I was going to do so.
Phillip Jeffries.<eos> Phillip Jeffries?<eos> I need to be debriefed by you about this work, Gordon.<eos> I will tell you the whole story, all its twists and turns, and I was going to do so.<eos> I was on my way to present it to you.
I will tell you the whole story, all its twists and turns, and I was going to do so.<eos> I was on my way to present it to you.<eos> I was a little bit behind schedule when my car veered over across the road, and I had my accident.<eos> Yes, Coop. This is how and why we found you.<eos> I need to be debriefed by you, Gordon.
Looked like maybe two people, but... his car's still here.<eos> I'm all set near the entrance.<eos> If he's in the car, I'll get him here.<eos> Once you find your wallet or your cell phone, a pay phone or some money, you can call AAA, Dougie.<eos> They will help you.
It's not about the bunny.<eos> Is it about the bunny?<eos> No. It's not about the bunny.<eos> All right. Go inside, Dougie.<eos> Someone will help you in there.
Someone will help you in there.<eos> - In there.<eos> - Right.<eos> And I think you should try to forget you ever met me.<eos> Shouldn't be too hard for you.
And I think you should maybe call a doctor or something because I think you might've had a little stroke or something.<eos> Something.<eos> Yes. You can go out now.<eos> Dougie, go.<eos> Come on, let's get you out of here.
Come on, let's get you out of here.<eos> Come on. Let's go, Dougie. Right, right.<eos> Call for help.<eos> In the back, Jack.<eos> You're gonna need some change. Some change.
The Black Hills? Seriously?<eos> As happy as this news makes us, Albert, we can't put this on the radio.<eos> Perfect.<eos> I've been dying to see Mount Rushmore.<eos> It's good you want to hurry.
Excuse me?<eos> This résumé is one of the worst written<eos> I've ever seen, and you didn't even fill out this form properly. Not even close.<eos> It's incomplete. It's worse than sloppy.<eos> I wanted to see you to tell you that if you ever want to find work anyplace, then you better get your act together, do things properly, and start showing some respect for a possible future employer,
And what you come back with tomorrow will have a whole hell of a lot to do with your future at this company.<eos> Case files.<eos> Is the men's room locked?<eos> Come on, I'll sneak you in the ladies'. Come on.<eos> You know, I was thinking... maybe I'll let you kiss me now, handsome.
I need some more money.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> He's looking for work.<eos> He will find a job.<eos> - Honey, I can give you this. - Okay. - But this is all I got.
You know how nervous I get.<eos> Come on. Besides, I got some great fucking feedback today.<eos> I'll tell you all about it at dinner.<eos> And in between, I'll tell you... how much I love you, and I'll tell you how beautiful you are, and I'll tell you how sexy you are, and those tits, how majestic they are,<eos> Give me a break, and I'll get you some bread.
It may be the key to what this is all about.<eos> And I told him where I'm going, so if he comes after me, I'll get him there.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, the Roadhouse is proud to welcome the Nine Inch Nails.<eos> Ten... nine... eight... seven... six... five... four... three... two... one.<eos> Did you like that song? Yes.
I did like that song.<eos> Look. I found a penny.<eos> And it's head's up.<eos> That means it's good luck.<eos> I hope it does bring you good luck.
You live by the school? How did you know that?<eos> I just do.<eos> So... I thought you were going with Mary.<eos> No. No, that's over.<eos> Are you... sad about that?
Good night. Good night, ma'am.<eos> Dougie, I'm sorry, I forgot, your car.<eos> Where is your car?<eos> Have you eaten?<eos> Come on. I'm gonna fix you a sandwich.
Yes, sweetheart.<eos> You have a super night too, Gordon.<eos> I don't know when I'm gonna get home.<eos> Thank you, Albert.<eos> And let me remind you that this work you are doing tonight is very, very important. And I will be thinking of you as I drink this... Here you go.
You know what? Next time, let's treat her.<eos> Yeah, great. Great idea.<eos> Stupid magic motherfucker.<eos> Ha, yeah, "kid"?<eos> I'll show you fucking kid.
No more gam...<eos> Get off him!<eos> Squeeze his hand off. Squeeze his hand off. Squeeze his hand off.<eos> Dougie!<eos> Oh, my God. Are you okay? Oh, Dougie.
Hey, Bobby, what's up?<eos> - You want some coffee?<eos> - Oh, no, thanks.<eos> I'm here with the fellas. We need to talk to you.<eos> I need to ask you some questions.
I can't believe this day has come.<eos> Watch right here.<eos> Bobby, when your father told me this, you were a very long way from where you are today.<eos> Somehow, he knew that it would all turn out well.<eos> He saw this life for you.
Wait a minute.<eos> There's something else.<eos> "COOPER/COOPER."<eos> Two Coopers.<eos> We came out to join you, Diane, while Albert's indisposed.
- Non-lethal. - Yeah!<eos> Lowering mayor package through hole.<eos> Madam Mayor!<eos> Thanks for dropping by.<eos> I've only got one thing to say to you, Joker.
Sorry, I was just lost in thought, and as you know, when I'm in there, I'm in deep.<eos> Were you looking at the old family pictures again?<eos> At the what?<eos> The old family...<eos> Oh, yes! I see what you mean.
I'm not here to throw down or anything.<eos> Uh, no, I would crush you.<eos> Okay. Sure, sure, sure.<eos> Hey, listen.<eos> Thank me later, but I just happened to be in the hood. And I figured that you could probably use the... Wait a minute.
- Hey, Frank.<eos> - You want a piece of Robin?<eos> - Barney!<eos> Nice compound fracture!<eos> - How'd you like a punch, Glen?
And prove I'm your greatest enemy.<eos> Batman, don't do this.<eos> As long as you're in the Phantom Zone, I'll be saving Gotham City, and that's all that matters to me.<eos> Goodbye, Joker.<eos> Oh, Batman, thank you!
- We've got his attention.<eos> - He's tracking us.<eos> I've got you now.<eos> Eat dirt!<eos> Bob's your uncle, you ruddy duff cobblers!
Didn't it turn out great?<eos> Hey, guys! It's my first family photo!<eos> - Hey, Bat-Dad.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm trying to give you a big, old H-U-G.
- Hey, Bat-Dad.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm trying to give you a big, old H-U-G.<eos> Okay, just...<eos> Batman, are you okay?
Bringing it, sir.<eos> For Queen and country!<eos> You just got Union Jacked!<eos> Robin, get ready.<eos> I'm about to teach you some father-and-son stuff.
So... the guy is still around.<eos> - What guy?<eos> - The Danny Rand wannabe.<eos> He was waiting outside my house this morning.<eos> - Are you okay?
Now we need to approach this with finesse.<eos> Like the way you handle everything in life?<eos> Ward.<eos> Leave this to me.<eos> I'll tell you exactly what to do.
Either way, this is the right thing to do, you know?<eos> This guy... whoever he is, he needs help, and we've made sure he's getting it.<eos> We could have just had him arrested.<eos> So we're saints.<eos> We're not bad guys, if that's what you think.
Oh, Chris.<eos> I'm sorry. I'm sorry.<eos> Your partner doesn't seem too comfortable around bodies.<eos> Yeah, well, he knew the guy.<eos> You seem all right.
Shit, what's happening? What the fuck is going on?<eos> - Justice, Ed. - Justice.<eos> Justice for what?<eos> We couldn't just let you get away with it.<eos> Not you. Not Chris Morrow. Not Andy Sikes.
What did you do?<eos> It was hard to hear, you know, with, like, the wind and Nikki in my ear, and then, when I got on the railing, everybody started shouting.<eos> And then underwater, you can't, like, hear anything underwater.<eos> But it sounded like, you know, you were getting to something good.<eos> It was like about how, if you're, shit, ready to be, like, the person who always forgives me, then I want to be the person who always forgives you.
Where is the dosh?<eos> Do you think that robbing a bank is easy?<eos> You gaggle of gutless eels, are the ones guilty of putting me in this dreadful pickle in the first place.<eos> Now line up and offer me a tribute.<eos> You want us to pay YOU? !
What would you like me to read first?<eos> Before we get to that, I'm just curious, why are you here?<eos> I was given 100 hours of community service.<eos> No, I mean, how did a nice girl like you end up married to an asshole like Mark Dutchman?<eos> I don't have to explain myself to you.
- ...but you know, maybe 3 or 4 weeks.<eos> - Not good enough.<eos> Mark... I need you to take an honest look at what you're facing.<eos> There's a possibility of you doing substantial time.<eos> Your associate is testifying against you.
- Tell me.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I forgive you.<eos> Just end this thing with him.<eos> Oh, I don't know if I forgive you.
Is that it?<eos> Run, son!<eos> Wait here, son.<eos> Run, son!<eos> You are resisting the sword. The sword isn't resisting you.
You don't need to look away.<eos> The sword is yours, son.<eos> Take it.<eos> You wanted to know what gave me such drive?<eos> It was you.
What is that about... curiosity and the cat?<eos> Shaw didn't die in the crash.<eos> No.<eos> What did you do to her?<eos> Exactly what I am going to do to you.
- Enjoy the ride.<eos> No, I don't understand!<eos> You said this is all a dream.<eos> Yes, it is all a dream.<eos> But you ain't dreaming nothing.
One slice of each.<eos> And more champagne.<eos> Yes, more champagne.<eos> I'll get the champagne then.<eos> No more wine for you.
She always hoped you'd come back someday.<eos> "Gail.<eos> "I wish that I could find better words today to tell you I'm sorry.<eos> "You shouldn't have to read this, because I already made you suffer too much.<eos> "But I know that you and Fergus "are living in a better world without all my chaos.
Now go.<eos> Live your life.<eos> And forget me.<eos> Forget you?<eos> Everything I am is because of you. I love you, Belle.
The real underlying flaw in your life is that you don't think that I'm good.<eos> I am!<eos> And if you knew me and how much I love you, then even when you don't understand, you could know that I am at work in your life for good.<eos> And then you would trust me.<eos> Trust you?
- Yes. Come on, then.<eos> Darling, come on over here.<eos> Would you rather have seven dirty-ass tramps take dumps in your mouth, and all they've eaten all day is spring onions, boiled ham and raw eggs, or would you rather suck off your old man?<eos> And when I say suck him off I don't mean give him a quick jerk under the table.<eos> I mean, you'd have to seduce him, you know, to the point where he's grabbing your hair and forcing your fucking face down into his cock - and he thrusts into your throat.
- Kevin, Andy, so you're finally leaving. Lucas, yeah.<eos> Uh, Jules found a really good deal in the Caribbean.<eos> We're gonna spend some quality time with the family.<eos> Oh, that's what vacations are for.<eos> And only because of you Margie and I were able to spend our last vacation together.
No one's in an owl costume.<eos> You're missing out.<eos> Here's Tony.<eos> Give him his medicine and have him back on Saturday.<eos> I don't know why the judge just didn't make you keep him.
Go ahead.<eos> Take a look.<eos> And guess what...<eos> I'm not giving it to anyone.<eos> Just you.
If we don't hit the 60 percent pass rate, we're gonna be spending a lot more time together in queue at the job center.<eos> So, Tom, how did you get on with the exercises?<eos> Tom.<eos> - Triangles?<eos> - What? Okay, Eileen, what about you?
There is no more money.<eos> That was a lie.<eos> She's not my child.<eos> But I love her.<eos> You may not love her.
Better?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Shall we take that off?<eos> I smell bad.<eos> What would be the worst thing I could ever do to you?
Shit, shit, that sucks.<eos> Okay, all right, something better, something better.<eos> Don't be a fool, be cool.<eos> Hi.<eos> And a big hi right back at you, Mr. Carter.
So you and I are going to continue our little walk alone.<eos> Just to see what happens. Move.<eos> Don't be frightened.<eos> I have a very strong feeling this thing doesn't want to harm you.<eos> Yeah, well, hopefully that doesn't include you.
I don't do handshakes.<eos> It'll have to be a hug.<eos> I know.<eos> Oh, Sherlock, what can I say?<eos> Thanks to you, we're, er... we're everywhere!
- Do it.<eos> Step closer.<eos> Tell me what you remember.<eos> You, me and Mycroft.<eos> He could understand things if you went a bit slow, but you, you were my favourite.
It's very important.<eos> I can't say why.<eos> But I promise you, it is.<eos> I can't say that, I can't...<eos> I can't say that to you.
I'm not the one that just flew across the universe just because I wanted to win.<eos> Do not tell me what I want.<eos> I don't need to tell you what you want!<eos> It's obvious!<eos> You were the one who wanted to win. And I just wanted a sister!
Let me help you.<eos> Whatever is going on, there's nothing you can do, okay?<eos> I literally can't tell you.<eos> I'm not going to let it happen to you, Virgil.<eos> Especially not you.
What? I have to do this.<eos> I'm not crazy.<eos> Let me help you.<eos> No, you can't.<eos> But I can help you, if you go!
That's enough.<eos> You sure you don't want to take this?<eos> Mike said you're fishing buddies.<eos> I've known him since high school.<eos> He might tell you more than he'd tell me.
Want, not need.<eos> I don't need anything, Ray.<eos> If there's one thing you should know about me, Ray, it's that I don't need anything. I want.<eos> And I want that information.<eos> Kind of funny that she'll only give it to you.
It's the end of crime!<eos> All right! - That was amazing!<eos> - Over here, over here! - You did it!<eos> - Yeah, of course I did. I'm...<eos> Sorry, not you.
Well, luckily for us, you left your costume back at the...<eos> - Rip!<eos> - Oh! Nope. Under your clothes.<eos> That's perfect.<eos> - Alfred, what are you doing?
Better put that hood up.<eos> - Does it bother you?<eos> - What?<eos> That everyone knows me now.<eos> It doesn't bother you?
Vando... he was a fool once, too.<eos> Twice, actually.<eos> But he has a constant reminder of his failure.<eos> The fingers were because he screwed up. The tongue, because he lied about it.<eos> The real question is, how big a reminder do you need?
Exactly.<eos> I was just out of law school.<eos> No one here took me seriously.<eos> They had every right not to.<eos> The job just didn't come naturally to me like it did for you.
I've almost been killed three times this week.<eos> So no, Colleen, I'd say I'm pretty friggin' far from okay.<eos> I mean, are you hurt?<eos> No.<eos> But you are.
And Joy?<eos> How is she?<eos> Well, she's going into surgery.<eos> She'll be fine.<eos> All thanks to you.
Hey, there is no way I can repay you, Danny.<eos> You know, you freed me from the Hand.<eos> I can return to my life.<eos> With my children.<eos> All thanks to you.
Hey, Foggy.<eos> Just keep it clean.<eos> Not a lot of people have insurance here.<eos> Yeah? At least nobody died.<eos> Thanks to you.
Look, I'm not looking for super friends.<eos> Yeah, you keep on telling yourself that.<eos> You came to Midland Circle for a reason.<eos> I came to help Harlem.<eos> Not you.
Not very well.<eos> How many were there?<eos> Just one.<eos> The same one that came after John Raymond.<eos> What kind of person knocks out you and Luke Cage?
After my last job, where I just tried to calm down angry people all day...<eos> I'm just grateful to be here.<eos> I gotta go put out a fire.<eos> Sounds exciting. Very.<eos> So, uh, I'll leave you to it.
She's calling me again!<eos> It's like she's totally stalking me.<eos> Dee, what do I do here?<eos> You have been stalking that woman for 15 years.<eos> Now she's finally showing you some attention, and you don't like it?
Yes, John.<eos> Whatever you'd like, John. Would you like a back rub with that, John?<eos> You're going to help me.<eos> Why the fuck would I do that?<eos> Because I'm the only one that can help you.
That's downright upright of you, Mr. Wick.<eos> You sound positively magnanimous.<eos> But look around you.<eos> How much help does it look like I need?<eos> It seems to me that the real question, Mr. Wick, is who in this cruel world of ours, is going to help you?
You think I'm a genius?<eos> Yes!<eos> Yes, I think you're a genius.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> When I was your age, I couldn't have accomplished half the things you did today.
Where the fuck have you been?<eos> I told you to come straight here.<eos> I've had people out combing the streets, looking for you.<eos> I'm sorry I don't always do as I'm told.<eos> Maybe you just really need someone who obeys every command.
Good morning.<eos> Morning.<eos> Sleep okay?<eos> I did.<eos> You?
I know! I'm sorry i didn't tell you.<eos> Oh, please. Come here.<eos> So, how does it feel to bag Seattle's most eligible bachelor?<eos> It's a little scary, but...<eos> Well, if anyone can make it work, it's you.
There are shortages of food... meds and ammunition.<eos> Every hour we delay costs thousands of German lives.<eos> One attack and the world could be ours.<eos> As we speak, my chemistry...<eos> We stand against you and your... witch.
- You're better than her.<eos> - They call her "Low Tide."<eos> This is what you dreamed of your whole life.<eos> Gonna give it up because you're scared?<eos> Because Misty Holloway trying to turn the crowd against you?
Why live only a quarter mile at a time, when you can live your whole life that way?<eos> See all those blow that muscles will give you.<eos> All show and no..<eos> Well I got plenty of goal.<eos> You must have misplaced that. When I kicked your ass up in down that office of yours.
Look, I get why you pushed us away.<eos> It was to protect us.<eos> But, Dad, you've done your time now.<eos> It's over.<eos> Let us help you get back on your feet.
That's worse, man.<eos> Sure as hell have seen my share of violence, man, but when you're in it... when you're on the other end... that's a whole different ball game, brother.<eos> Look, man, I've never been in an actual gunfight myself... so I'm not gonna sit here and tell you I know what you're going through, because I don't.<eos> But what I do know is that there's a young girl out there who's safe right now.<eos> And that's because of you.
You heard right.<eos> Be punctual.<eos> They've brought the carriage up. Yes.<eos> I'm coming.<eos> You're not imploring him to relinquish his deed, you're insisting that, for his own welfare, he submit his claim to you.
You probably don't remember who you are, so let me remind you.<eos> You've been following me, haven't you?<eos> Now. Are you King or are you Company?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> Now there is nothing up that road for you apart from death and anybody like you.
Just close the door behind you<eos> When you go, phil. Yes, sir.<eos> Dougie, Now that I've had time to think about this, It's clear that your investigative work<eos> The recent two attempts on your life, The blowing up your car, the man trying to shoot you, Absolutely confirm this.<eos> Also, thanks to you, we now know that The mitchum brothers' case was not arson But a legitimate claim for an accidental fire,
- Oh, my God. - Do you really like it?<eos> It... it's magnificent.<eos> And those drapes are completely silent.<eos> This is my tribute to you, Dr. Amp.<eos> Thanks to you, I am really starting to shovel myself out of the shit!
Uh, maybe it means something to you.<eos> Thank you very much, Frank.<eos> Although I can't comment on this information, I want you to know I really appreciate it.<eos> All right, Director Cole, uh, I understand.<eos> And all the best to you and all the best to Harry.
Sorry I woke you up.<eos> Am I in trouble?<eos> No, of course not.<eos> Hey, you trust me, right?<eos> And I trust you.
No, no, no, I was helping you. - Please don't lie.<eos> - I swear...<eos> Okay... a little bit. I mean, I sort of used you.<eos> But, it wasn't really about you.<eos> It was more about me and in order to help me I wanted to help you.
Hi, sweetie.<eos> What?<eos> Sorry, I forgot the code.<eos> Is Hugo here?<eos> Thanks to god, no thanks to you.
Perhaps not everything.<eos> Jordan.<eos> If the Hellhound can open the rift, we all go together.<eos> You're the bad guy.<eos> I'm pretty sure helping you is a bad idea.
Glad to see you're obeying hospital protocols.<eos> Your daughter asked me to treat you.<eos> In exchange for what?<eos> Told you, you needed a plan.<eos> She helps you, you help me.
She wants to help me move into my dorm, so...<eos> You know she's starting MIT as a Junior?<eos> - How do you even do that?<eos> - I... She's a genius.<eos> Real question is how'd you get into UC Davis?
So... let's find out.<eos> Benjamin Jones, I'd like you to meet my supervisor, Agent Justine Diaz.<eos> Agent Dao speaks very highly of you, Agent Diaz.<eos> You mean Special Agent Dao, now of the FBI's Intelligence Division.<eos> I got promoted thanks to you.
You know why?<eos> Because someone with a shiv found out that he made a deal with the feds.<eos> The United States government is gonna pay you to be a criminal?<eos> I know it sounds good, but...<eos> - What, just you?
A sniper just shot my left lieutenant jamison. In the head right in front of me.<eos> I want you to find out who.<eos> You want to hire us?<eos> You are still a private investigation. And security firm, are you not?<eos> No thanks to you.
You made this about me when you ruined my life!<eos> I didn't do that all by myself, did I?<eos> But you seem to have forgiven ben for his p...<eos> Ben didn't call the fbi!<eos> I didn't do that to you!
- It's okay.<eos> Kenji is not our guy.<eos> There's a bigger bad out there.<eos> You keep saying that, but there's no proof.<eos> Yes, there is, thanks to you and your surveillance cameras.
- She ever tell you about that? - Yeah.<eos> I got "bad blood."<eos> Oh, heck, who doesn't?<eos> How is your sister?<eos> Alive, no thanks to you.
But glinda, she watched the last of the witches get slaughtered by the beast.<eos> What good would new ones be?<eos> Sober up, you fool!<eos> She's not going to use them against the beast.<eos> She's going to use them against you.
Toto! Hey, boy.<eos> Is she...<eos> Asleep.<eos> Why are you helping me?<eos> Not you.
Can I count on you to build my arsenal?<eos> The Mother Witch lives and breathes for Glinda!<eos> I saw young Witches.<eos> She's not going to use them against The Beast.<eos> She's going to use them against you.
No.<eos> No, I swear.<eos> I stand before you anew.<eos> Clean, ready to redeem myself.<eos> Ready to serve you and our mother.
Please...<eos> My sister... do you feel her inside you?<eos> What does she command?<eos> A message.<eos> For you.
The mother witch lives!<eos> And breeds for glinda.<eos> She's not going to use them against the beast.<eos> She's going to use them against you. This beast will have a heart.
We all have sex issues.<eos> I haven't slept with my wife in a year.<eos> But when people have oversexualized behavior like yours, sometimes that's evidence of past childhood trauma and I just wanted you to feel safe talking to me.<eos> There's been no trauma, okay?<eos> And my goal in life isn't to feel safe talking to you.
Listen, I've done back flips with worse injuries than this.<eos> We're gonna need backup.<eos> Clearly, he blames us for Reed.<eos> We don't know who in this department is in on this.<eos> - I trust you, and you trust me.
You?<eos> Ah, you fool.<eos> John Spode, you're under arrest. For what?<eos> Murder.<eos> I warn you, anything you say may be taken down and used in evidence against you.
Handle what?<eos> There are a lot of high-powered women who live here.<eos> Some run banks, others run google<eos> Or yahoo and...<eos> Sometimes i feel like you're grooming me To get to a place you, um, couldn't.
What are you really losing?<eos> Dear Mom, The first thing is that I love you.<eos> You already know that, but I may not get the chance to tell you again.<eos> You are smart and strong and kind and selfless.<eos> Because of you, I've survived this long and gotten to know my small part of the world.
- Fine.<eos> Your denying this will not save your life.<eos> It was a car accident.<eos> And I loved my wife.<eos> Gives you no right to do what you did.
You've got to believe me.<eos> You and Brinn are wonderful people.<eos> I want the best for you.<eos> I never wanted to do you any harm.<eos> You and countless others on a grand scale.
Oh, my God, your dad is a fighter pilot.<eos> He's a logistics expert, mostly.<eos> Look over there.<eos> He's checking you out.<eos> - He's checking you out.
He's a logistics expert, mostly.<eos> Look over there.<eos> He's checking you out.<eos> - He's checking you out.<eos> - No, you, and he's cute.
Thank you so much for taking time to help me with this.<eos> No, I'm glad. It's cool.<eos> I've been working on this project, and I could use a break.<eos> This book is a break?<eos> Well, helping you.
Why are you protecting Bryce?<eos> What does he have on you?<eos> I'm not protecting Bryce, you little fuck!<eos> God, I'm protecting Jessica!<eos> I care more about Jessica than I do about Hannah, than I do about you, than I do about anybody else.
You got this rebel with a cause thing going on.<eos> Well... that's me.<eos> - Jeff's a good influence on you. - You think?<eos> I mean, he got you to go to a party.<eos> You've done that before.
There's no winning or losing.<eos> You shuffle to transfer your energy to the cards.<eos> Now cut the deck.<eos> So, uh... what do the cards say?<eos> This one, nine of wands, but it's reversed, which means you feel the world is against you.
- I really do.<eos> - You know what people will say?<eos> No.<eos> And I don't care.<eos> Because it's easy for you, right?
Please, the woman next door will call the cops.<eos> We're done.<eos> Mom.<eos> IthoughtmaybeIcouldforget about what had happened.<eos> But thanks to you, Bryce... I'd finally lived up to my reputation.
- You want to go? - Nah. We can do this.<eos> Yeah, I know we can.<eos> How you doing?<eos> !<eos> Eight more! How about you?
Group home.<eos> This isn't like that, though.<eos> Not the bad parts, at least.<eos> For the first time, I feel like I belong.<eos> Trying to make sure you and Sasha became a part of this made me a part of this.
If it wasn't for him... Where do you think he is?<eos> I don't care.<eos> You don't care if he's dead or alive?<eos> No, I don't.<eos> And neither should you.
I had it analyzed.<eos> And?<eos> It's like you.<eos> From another planet.<eos> Where were you? I don't have to explain myself to you.
I think.<eos> You're, uh...<eos> Kind of like his guide star, right?<eos> Lighting the way, and all, through the dark.<eos> Like Julie is to you.
Okay. In cans.<eos> When do I go home?<eos> We'll get to that, but first, we need to talk about something I thought we went over last time.<eos> Everything we say in here is privileged.<eos> No one can use it against you, but you got to be honest with us.
They said it couldn't be done.<eos> The President-Elect could not be moved.<eos> That's what they said.<eos> But she has been, finally.<eos> And I owe it all to you.
It goes a long way in, what is it, Costa Rica?<eos> I think I'll keep my retirement plans to myself.<eos> - No offense.<eos> - None taken.<eos> I have a lot of people angry at me thanks to you.
Are you threatening me now?<eos> I'm telling you it's a war you won't win.<eos> Two hundred and fifty years of movement toward the light in this country, towards justice...<eos> Say what you want, call me naive, but I believe in that light.<eos> And I will not be held hostage by you or anybody else.
- All that footage you gave us.<eos> You already earned it.<eos> Okay. But you can't let us down.<eos> I'm... Look at those guys over there. Look.<eos> They are here because of you, because you had the guts to speak out.
He had a new family.<eos> So, I wish they wouldn't have told me, because I was already where I belonged.<eos> Well, do you know what I wish?<eos> I wish you'd never left her for me.<eos> I didn't leave Lily for you, Nora.
He got better because of us, because of the work we've been doing, because of the book.<eos> Laurie gave him psycho babble.<eos> We gave him faith.<eos> She doesn't believe in the same thing we do, but she wants to help Kevin.<eos> I think she'd wanna help you, too, if you just talk to her.
You named me Secretary of Defense.<eos> You were asked who did you want in this position, and you named me.<eos> You summoned me out of retirement and I came back because I owed you.<eos> You helped me, Kevin.<eos> And now I'm here to help you.
That you wouldn't use your men to force a scenario by which he ends up dead?<eos> I'm not gonna stand by and watch while all our futures are destroyed.<eos> No.<eos> But perhaps it's worth focusing on how hard I'm working to persuade you not to make that decision.<eos> I would far, far rather do this with you than against you.
It's not about not trusting you.<eos> She had no choice.<eos> Can I get some water?<eos> It-it is so hot in here.<eos> Are you not hot?
But you're losing them.<eos> You're out of control.<eos> You'll end up making them do something they'd never think of doing.<eos> Like what?<eos> If you keep going like this... they're gonna turn on you.
I was so blind to the truth.<eos> Until my father died. Until you murdered him.<eos> I should thank you.<eos> Thank me?<eos> You're the reason I'm here today.
- I have the blockers.<eos> - Yeah. You won't need them.<eos> This isn't a trick, Will.<eos> That game's over for me.<eos> Thanks to you, I have the most secure position I've ever had in the organization.
- I have the blockers.<eos> - Yeah. You won't need them.<eos> This isn't a trick, Will.<eos> That game's over for me.<eos> Thanks to you, I have the most secure position I've ever had in the organization.
It's to be admired in a sense, but that is the last time you use it today.<eos> I'm a man who could make things difficult for you, but I won't.<eos> As long as you'll understand this.<eos> Your next opponent is that boy.<eos> And I want him to have a very good time playing against you.
His father was the best there was.<eos> True master.<eos> Hall of Fame.<eos> Always finished top three.<eos> But to you, top three is never enough.
Like when your ashes need hauling?<eos> Man, she's 75 years old.<eos> She looks in on Hushpuppy when I gotta be out late.<eos> Anyway, she told me about your little rooftop phone call you made yesterday after you Houdini'd out of my zip ties.<eos> She told you, you told Vince.
Right. Home time.<eos> Home!<eos> Richard should've been here for the final preparations.<eos> I know. We all miss him.<eos> Do you?
Skivvying?<eos> Cleaning, offices.<eos> - No shame in it.<eos> - Never said there is.<eos> It's all right for you. You've got work to go to.
There's blood. There's prints.<eos> Woz, you really ought to give me a heads-up about this stuff.<eos> Jump on the scanner.<eos> You know, one of the things you taught me was to pick my battles.<eos> So now let me help you pick yours.
- Yes.<eos> - No.<eos> I don't even know how two people like us even made someone as wonderful as you.<eos> You're a miracle.<eos> Look, I am who I am because of you.
I lost it in the fight.<eos> Melissa's gonna kill us.<eos> I don't think we can ever go back there again.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That might work for you, but what about me?
- What about him?<eos> No, no.<eos> We were told to leave him for...<eos> Ohh, oh.<eos> Didn't she just tell you it'd be impossible for you to say nothing forever?
Tell him to keep it to himself and make something up.<eos> I need a couple of days, at least.<eos> Where you going?<eos> This is for you and Mom.<eos> I didn't know when would be a good time to give it to you.
My dad and my step-mom... they're amazing.<eos> They couldn't love me more.<eos> But I always felt different.<eos> Like an outsider in my own family.<eos> And you're right, you did have it harder than me in a lot of ways.
Oh, yeah. It's around here somewhere.<eos> Um... hey, honey?<eos> I have a call-in to Reverend Steve to check dates for Carlton's baptism.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Yeah, I was thinking sometime in the next couple of weeks if that's okay with you and Lily.
Did you lie about... everything?<eos> The connection that you felt with Angelo... were you making all of that up?<eos> What do you want me to say?<eos> I lost my biological dad the day that I got switched and then I lost him again the day that he died.<eos> And thanks to you, I just lost him for a third time.
And someone was reborn.<eos> I really do have his heart.<eos> I don't like to think about him.<eos> He's dead and I'm alive.<eos> I wanted this, like, mystical connection to you.
I figured if I waited here long enough, you'd show up.<eos> It's safe for us?<eos> Does this mean you've thought about things?<eos> That, uh, you're gonna help me?<eos> Not you.
I could.<eos> But it'd be really nice to go to Venice.<eos> There you are.<eos> Here I am.<eos> Hello to you, too.
How do I get out?<eos> There is no out.<eos> But you could change sides, be a part of the winning team.<eos> You want me to join you in torturing my friends?<eos> You and whoever's on the other end of that ear piece.
But every single one is about Nicole.<eos> Um, how we fell in love, Nicole's disappearance Nicole's rescue, our reunion.<eos> That is what the book is about?<eos> Nicole.<eos> Nicole and you.
Mona, you know that I want that but the others can't find out that you're involved.<eos> You didn't tell them that I know about the game.<eos> I couldn't.<eos> They still don't trust me?<eos> Fine, I'll help you and your friends like I always do and then crawl back under a rock.
- And maybe I still do.<eos> - No.<eos> No, you do not.<eos> Okay? I was scared.<eos> And I've done some... really terrible things to you and everyone else.
I let you down, Michael.<eos> I should have taken care of Luca when I had the chance.<eos> You didn't let me down.<eos> You couldn't have known.<eos> We're so close because of you, Linc.
There's something we need you to look into.<eos> First, tell me how my friends are.<eos> Did everyone make it?<eos> Clarke?<eos> I'm here, thanks to you.
It almost broke your mother to send you away.<eos> Killing Lexa in soulou gonplei was to be your triumphant return, but you lost.<eos> Our war chiefs don't respect you.<eos> Then I'll get new war chiefs.<eos> The army is loyal to them, not you.
I've failed my girls all my life.<eos> I... I just wanted to make things right.<eos> You didn't fail us.<eos> Victoria Hogarth, I am arresting you for the murder of Gemma Wyatt.<eos> You do not have to say anything, but it may harm your defence if you do not mention, when questioned, something you later rely on in court.
Someone who answers to you.<eos> A puppet.<eos> Call it what you like.<eos> You'll have your own territory, your own Clippers...<eos> What makes you so sure I won't use those Clippers against you?
Seems like we found our way into The Widow's heart.<eos> Who are you?<eos> I'm a friend of M.K.'s.<eos> Maybe the only friend he has left in the world, now that Sunny's charged off to some tragically noble end.<eos> No thanks to you, of course.
All of our plans, the passports, the shop, everything is probably under rubble by now.<eos> I got someone on it.<eos> What, the kid you throw planes to?<eos> No.<eos> I'm talking about the only person I trust in the world as much as I trust you.
I don't give a damn about you.<eos> Yeah, whatever.<eos> You cracked if you think Queen Elizabeth here ever gonna help you with your case?<eos> And why wouldn't I?<eos> Maybe I'd help you, too, if you shut your mouth for once.
Worry about Laurel, the D.A.'s office coming after us, not Annalise.<eos> She's a human being.<eos> At the very least, she deserves our sympathy.<eos> Oh. Say, "She's a human and deserves our sympathy."<eos> You have my sympathy because you're a blind, trusting fool.
Um, we'd definitely take a haircut if we broke it.<eos> But we are allowed to sublet.<eos> Might be our best option.<eos> Furniture's mostly rented month to month. So that's not an issue.<eos> For you, I think you need a desk, some file cabinets.
A frustrated policy wonk in the CIA who felt he could do better than his superiors.<eos> So he created a cell within the CIA called 21-void, implementing his own intelligence operations.<eos> And he needed my help breaking out people imprisoned all over the world.<eos> Terrorists, political dissidents rogue agents...<eos> And if I did it, you and Sara, you'd go free.
Leaving for the U.S. tonight.<eos> How's C-Note?<eos> He's fine.<eos> We all are.<eos> Everyone. We're going to make it. It's because of you.
He's fine.<eos> We all are.<eos> Everyone. We're going to make it. It's because of you.<eos> Because of my money.<eos> It's because of you.
Just for a minute.<eos> I don't want to make trouble here, but I can.<eos> We're going to put you on a regimen.<eos> I'll consult with Dr. Drummond.<eos> You help us help you.
When my parents died, I was young.<eos> I was alone, and I ran from this house.<eos> Trying to be what they would have wanted.<eos> But you failed.<eos> Just like you failed to keep your hands off your own flesh and blood!
I don't owe you anything.<eos> - My son...<eos> - Yes, your son.<eos> I failed at my job, and Charanpal died.<eos> I owe him. Not you.
It took some convincing.<eos> Some of them aren't too keen on this idea.<eos> Neither am I, to be honest.<eos> Then why are you here?<eos> I trust you.
I left.<eos> And I found my way to New York.<eos> You went AWOL?<eos> - I - like to think of it more like a walk about, but um... the good news is, I was successful.<eos> You can be, too.
How long will it take to effect repairs?<eos> 15 years.<eos> Well, that won't do.<eos> What is that, Captain?<eos> There are some things, Gideon, I can't even tell you.
With it, you can take down politicians, bankrupt companies, spark revolutions.<eos> So you're not just giving me the file for John.<eos> You inspired me to make the world a better place, and now I intend to inspire you to be the hacktivist you used to be, the great Ghost Fox Goddess.<eos> Let me guess.<eos> You're trusting me with your mask off, so now I'm supposed to trust you.
It's exactly like I don't trust you.<eos> Check it out.<eos> Stay on comms.<eos> Why does he get a weapon and I don't?<eos> I trust him more than you.
Tell Lisa I said hi.<eos> Will do.<eos> Your little outburst with the DA.<eos> It's gone viral.<eos> IA is going to file a 128 against you.
You callin' him your boyfriend don't sound like<eos> - you're serious about gettin' outta the life.<eos> - You don't know me.<eos> - My mom'll help you.<eos> - Like she helped you?
Ok.<eos> I'll take it.<eos> Hey.. This is so completely unfair.<eos> Yeah. That seems to be going around lately.<eos> So you got Oliver's girlfriend fired?
No.<eos> Uh, no.<eos> You're right. Ok.<eos> So quid pro quo.<eos> I help you, you help me.
We're your strength.<eos> You give me strength until Chase turns it into a weakness.<eos> Look what happened with Susan.<eos> I let myself get close to Susan, and in so doing, I gave Chase a way to get to me.<eos> That could happen with you, with... with Felicity... with my son.
It means Kovar is planning something very big and very terrible.<eos> What is he gonna do?<eos> Oliver, maybe time is best for you to go back to America.<eos> Anatoly, we're brothers.<eos> What's happening to you is happening to me.
Why can't you do that for me?<eos> Lyla, I guess I never really thought of it like that.<eos> Well, maybe you should start because I'm not Oliver, Johnnie.<eos> I'm your wife, and even though I disagreed with many of your choices, I trusted those choices.<eos> I trusted you.
One you think channels monster inside you.<eos> And protects the people that are closest to me.<eos> I do it this way, my enemies will target the hood, not the ones I care for.<eos> You are many things, Oliver Queen, but until today I did not count naive as one of them.<eos> The people closest to you will always pay the most for your sins.
This isn't real. It's not real.<eos> You're in my head.<eos> And who better than you knows the truth?<eos> What truth?<eos> That those closest to you are fated to suffer for your sins.
We're losing her, Nick.<eos> I hope that thing does what we think it does.<eos> Yeah, me too.<eos> How much do you know about the stick that he used to heal me with?<eos> Not much more than he told you.
Yeah, me too.<eos> How much do you know about the stick that he used to heal me with?<eos> Not much more than he told you.<eos> Does he always carry it?<eos> No, he got it out to help you.
What do you want? Anything. Anything.<eos> Tell me how you became a Daylighter.<eos> - I told you I don't know.<eos> - I don't believe you.<eos> And if you can't help me... I can't help you.
Everything's going to be okay.<eos> Jace?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You're okay?<eos> Now that you are.
That sounds like a threat.<eos> You need me.<eos> You need my government's resources and my protection.<eos> I need a patron who understands the historic importance of what's happening, and can adjust his world view accordingly.<eos> But you're just trying to save your job. So I'll let you get back to it.
Unlike my Father, I have no taste for virgins.<eos> Enjoy her.<eos> Until Sunday... when I will finally make her mine... body and soul.<eos> Now, what is it you wish to speak about?<eos> You have held my loyalty for centuries, my lord, but in Mary's embrace I faltered and, in secret, I've conspired against you.
Jerome is just the first step.<eos> You think we're a small band. But we are everywhere.<eos> Put out a citywide call, I want every unit looking for this symbol. Go, now.<eos> We're almost done loading the vans.<eos> How are you doing?
That car belonged to Isabella.<eos> Ed, whatever you've heard...<eos> I know it was you, Oswald.<eos> Isabella was my everything, and you took her from me.<eos> And now I've taken everything from you.
We got business.<eos> Does that shock your tender sensibilities?<eos> - He's a thief. - I'm a thief.<eos> - You can't trust him.<eos> - But I can trust you?
But nothing bad is going to happen to him.<eos> Then where is he?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> You just have to trust me. You need to leave Gotham today.<eos> Trust you?
I feel... nothing.<eos> Talons have served the Court since its inception.<eos> The Court culls them from orphanages.<eos> Trains them.<eos> What I did to you, the Court has done with them for 200 years.
- For you.<eos> - Here.<eos> Okay. What is going on with you two?<eos> - Uh, do you want to? - Mm-mm.<eos> This is all you.
Stupid.<eos> Still here, pretender?<eos> Still trying to find your place?<eos> I found my place.<eos> It's standing here with these people, against you.
Not learning your lesson, Barry.<eos> You keep telling us one thing and then doing another.<eos> ♪ ♪ You wanna know what inspired Leonard Snart to sacrifice himself?<eos> It was you, Barry Allen.<eos> You inspired him to be better.
But I am really starting to get worried.<eos> Okay. It's just been a few hours?<eos> I'm sure she'll turn up.<eos> I'll fly from Hong Kong to Vegas and meet you both there.<eos> I'm buying you and Cass tickets right now.
But fate has led us here, and there's nothing left to stop us.<eos> Not a doubt remains in my mind.<eos> In fact, why not just get on with it?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I mean that as soon as we put that bloody bell into a suitable indoor hiding place, let's you and me grab an empty syringe, and head straight for Elena's warehouse in Brooklyn.
Okay?<eos> So just tell me where you are.<eos> I'm coming to get you.<eos> No.<eos> I can't face you, and I can't face Bonnie.
Call his name.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Enzo, I thought I'd never see you again.<eos> You have to get away from Cade.<eos> He's trying to find me through you.
And if you screw this up... we don't know what he'll do to Elena.<eos> I'm sorry, Damon.<eos> I have to do this.<eos> Yeah, I'm sorry, too.<eos> But I can't let anything happen to her or you.
Son, I don't know how to tell you this.<eos> What is it, Mum?<eos> I... was wrong.<eos> I wanted to prove to you that Chloe wasn't worthy of you.<eos> I gave her every incentive to turn on you.
Well, besides sex, but...<eos> You're looking well these days.<eos> So confident, so cheery.<eos> I almost didn't recognize you.<eos> Thanks to you, Mom.
You're surly, suspicious.<eos> You don't play well with others.<eos> Well, that is accurate.<eos> You don't trust people you don't know, even when they come bearing gifts.<eos> Now I can't help that, but I can help you.
Okay, then.<eos> Hell, what do I know?<eos> I've never gone after a demon before.<eos> I don't even know why you called me.<eos> Because if Sam and Dean think they're helping you and not me, they won't ask the wrong questions.
Well...<eos> that's your luxury.<eos> We have a code.<eos> Thank you, Mr. Ketch.<eos> Well, now Hayden's mom, she gets to bury two kids instead of one, thanks to you and thanks to your code.
I mean, you don't need to.<eos> I wasn't lying.<eos> Your baby's strong, so strong.<eos> Whatever happens, he is going to be just fine.<eos> But you... Won't.
Which makes you an idiot. I know that, too.<eos> Apparently, you and the legion of demons that I've assigned to this task haven't been motivated properly.<eos> You going to skin me alive, sire?<eos> Would it be that simple.<eos> I have to remind you and your team of screwups of the pride of superior work, the thrill of pleasing me, and the gratification of living one more day.
Cold, even.<eos> Leaving you, working with them...<eos> I was trying to make things right.<eos> Just from a distance, because... Being here with you was too hard.<eos> Seeing what I'd done to you and to Sam, I...
Not for me.<eos> And do not say Dan. Because he would not want this.<eos> How do you know?<eos> I still dream of Dan.<eos> Do you?
- ...following a fight.<eos> - I know nothing about it.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Because if you do, now is the time to mention it.<eos> There's a lot stacking up against you, Ed.
- No, honey, I don't want to. - Yeah.<eos> Come on, let's dance.<eos> Sweetheart, you bought a car, and now you're grinding on the neighbors, and this is not who you are.<eos> Maybe it is.<eos> Maybe it's who I've always wanted to be. Maybe it's not who you are.
Reptiles aren't contagious.<eos> Are you sure you're a qualified nurse?<eos> Maybe the children should wait outside.<eos> Being in a room with a dead body could be very traumatic.<eos> We've already been in a room with a dead body thanks to you.
Ice Juice.<eos> I can take it over. I just need the cash.<eos> You know, my money's in a blind trust.<eos> That trust was set aside for you.<eos> Well, if this is what it takes... uh, to help you and Ira...
I read this while you were inside.<eos> I didn't know there was a name for it.<eos> I have always known since you were little... there was something in you.<eos> And I didn't do anything about it.<eos> I've done a lot of soul-searching... about my part in what happened to you.
Crane, you need to know something.<eos> You're not alone.<eos> You never will be.<eos> Take a look at where we are.<eos> That building is here because of you.
You're not alone.<eos> You never will be.<eos> Take a look at where we are.<eos> That building is here because of you.<eos> This whole country is here because of you.
No phones allowed in jail.<eos> W-w-well, hold on there, buddy.<eos> I mean, who do you think you are, huh?<eos> Y-y-you think you can treat us like this? Yeah?<eos> We're out here for the good of the great city of Albuquerque -- not for you.
You're lucky.<eos> Look, we don't have to be best pals.<eos> Just allies.<eos> We both want the same thing, for this picture to be a success.<eos> Well, I'm sure it will be, thanks to you.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!<eos> Police, hey!<eos> You are under arrest.<eos> You got the right to remain silent.<eos> Anything you say or do can and will be used against you in a court of law.
- For me?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Jesus Christ, we're a goddamned bona fide hit, and you're incapable of enjoying it.<eos> Well, it looks like you've been enjoying it enough for the both of us.<eos> Half the success belongs to you.
The keyword?<eos> It was my handprint.<eos> You must have made a mistake.<eos> Yeah, I did make a mistake.<eos> Believing in you.
Which is what the people that we hired to play Mr. and Mrs. Phelps led her to believe.<eos> For the moment.<eos> Scottie's resourceful.<eos> She'll figure out the truth in time.<eos> I just hope she's confided in you about Whitehall by then.
He's my son.<eos> I found out after giving you the kill order.<eos> That's why I called it off.<eos> Tom Keen is Christopher Hargrave.<eos> After all these years to find him working against you.
- We'll find Tom.<eos> - I know.<eos> That's what I'm afraid of.<eos> You did nothing wrong.<eos> If he's working against you, the company...
3/4 of the way down on the right.<eos> Back it up.<eos> Back it...<eos> You owe me one, Christina.<eos> Shalom to you too, Avi.
It was like Dr. Jekyll, Mistress Hyde.<eos> You became another person.<eos> Okay, I mean... I remember saying Chuck should apologize for Polly, but not because I thought he was Jason.<eos> - Why then?<eos> - Because... I am sick of guys like Chuck and Jason doing horrible things to girls like me, you, and Polly. Okay?
I am here for you, whenever. But why didn't you call the cops or animal control services?<eos> It was a message... for me from the Serpents.<eos> I didn't call the police because I don't trust them.<eos> I don't trust half the people in this damn town.<eos> Just you.
Of course, I was with you, and I know who you are.<eos> Those Paradise Lost kids went to death row because they wore black and they listened to Metallica.<eos> I don't wanna become a scapegoat.<eos> I'm not gonna let that happen.<eos> All the evidence against you is circumstantial.
Oh, Polly, come stay with us at Thornhill.<eos> Cheryl's invitation is genuine.<eos> Thornhill's gates will always be open to you.<eos> The child would want for nothing.<eos> You would want for nothing.
I'm no killer.<eos> - Do you believe him?<eos> - I do.<eos> Do you?<eos> I believe you, Jughead.
And the way things are going, pretty soon, the Coopers, we're not gonna exist anymore.<eos> And there's nothing I can do to stop that.<eos> Betty, don't do that.<eos> Don't give up.<eos> Your family is definitely splintering right now, but it won't fall apart, because of you.
Karlina Ordenko is dead.<eos> I believe a man named Grigory Krukov gave the order to have her killed.<eos> He's a high-ranking member of the FSB.<eos> You're a drunk with a security clearance.<eos> And you're that asshole who thought he could outsmart me.
Well, if you talk to Laurie Ann and you could just tell her...<eos> I'm not doing that.<eos> Your sister stole money.<eos> She stole money from my dad after he gave her work.<eos> She did that to him. She did that to you.
Jafar, what are you doing?<eos> What the hell, dude?<eos> Jafar Boustani, you're under arrest for the murder of Danny Nasiri.<eos> You have the right to remain silent.<eos> Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
- It's getting late.<eos> - Aah! No sunrise for you, but a warm dinner for me.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> What in the world happened to you?
Bobo Winthrop, you're under arrest for the murder of Aubrey Hamilton-Lowry.<eos> I didn't kill her!<eos> You have the right to remain silent.<eos> - I did not kill her!<eos> - Anything you say... can and will be used against you in a court of law.
We could afford a professional to teach me how to do this.<eos> I can see why you don't have many friends.<eos> I am just sure you have better things to do with your night off.<eos> I can't think of anything better than this.<eos> Can you?
I've got big plans for you.<eos> Stitch him up.<eos> He asked for a circle.<eos> Yeah, and he don't deserve one.<eos> Not for you to say!
The Bren'in will think on it and render a decision at a later time.<eos> Well, wait a minute.<eos> Wait!<eos> After all he's done...<eos> not just to Lady Ray, but to me, to you, to all of us...
I've been accused of many crimes in my lifetime.<eos> But keeping' a man from his wife is not amongst them.<eos> I take my leave.<eos> Thank you, Bren'in.<eos> Thank you.
Well, good for you.<eos> I didn't shoot nobody.<eos> Where's Wade Houghton?<eos> He's not here right now.<eos> You're not helping us to help you here, my friend.
They're here.<eos> We'll set him in place.<eos> Blessings for you.<eos> Here you are.<eos> Bren'in, the Kinnah thank you and your people for this gifting.
They don't really last too long, you know?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I was just cl... i've been cleaning out the house, Just trying to get rid of a bunch of old stuff, And...<eos> This is gonna sound really weird, But I was just about to donate a bunch of my mother's dresses, And I've got no use for them anymore.<eos> But I just felt bad putting them in the bin, And so I wondered if I could give them to you.
- You have the right - to remain silent. - What?<eos> No, hold on.<eos> Anything you say can and will be used against you...<eos> - You can't do that.<eos> - Against you in a court of law. - I was making it up.
She crossed the line.<eos> And I will make a motion in court to suppress your confession on the grounds that it was made during duress and cognitive impairment.<eos> That's great.<eos> I love that.<eos> But the state still has very strong physical evidence against you, Norman.
Mum, no, I don't want to take nothing. I just want to know -- will he see again?<eos> We have to be very patient.<eos> We have to wait for the swelling to come down, and then we'll know more.<eos> He's been living for Bobby.<eos> You'll pull him through, won't you?
It feels rather exciting, really.<eos> As though we've launched our little ship on a new adventure.<eos> I can't shake off the feeling that this new person -- whoever she may be -- is really a replacement for Sister Mary Cynthia.<eos> Who could fill her shoes?<eos> She is a very particular and gentle spirit, and I suspect I miss her at least as much as you do.
Why? What you going to do to me?<eos> Just look inside your mouth again, using my instruments, and in better light.<eos> Nurse Franklin can come along and hold your hand again, if you would like.<eos> - Would you?<eos> - If it helps you and helps baby. Yes.
You disgust me.<eos> The two of us are done.<eos> Frankie, don't be ridiculous!<eos> You know that I... would never do anything to hurt you.<eos> Everything I do is to help you... Help us, help the country.
Mellie, you are the next President of the United States.<eos> Come on, Els.<eos> Let Daddy go.<eos> You have the right to remain silent.<eos> Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
He talk, he-- he--<eos> Gets excited?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Men all like to talk.<eos> Oh, he champion. How do you like it here?
I'm not sure you'd be safe here.<eos> Oh, I will return, dear Spider.<eos> - One last time. - My lady--<eos> I have to die in this strange country.<eos> Just like you.
But a wise man once said that you should never believe a thing simply because you want to believe it.<eos> Which wise man said this?<eos> I don't remember.<eos> Are you trying to present your own statements as ancient wisdom?<eos> I would never do that. To you.
I knew it would kill me or I'd kill myself before it could.<eos> Daenerys Stormborn convinced me otherwise.<eos> The only place for me is back with her.<eos> I owe her my life.<eos> Her and you.
You treated him?<eos> Yes.<eos> Who told you to treat him?<eos> No one.<eos> Who forbade you, or anyone, to attempt to treat him?
Lord Commander Mormont thought you'd never come back to Westeros.<eos> But you are back.<eos> And it's been in your family for centuries.<eos> It's not right for me to have it.<eos> He gave it to you.
Got it?<eos> Got it.<eos> Come on. Ahhh!<eos> - Good luck.<eos> - You, too.
Uh... walk me to the truck.<eos> I didn't want to say anything in front of your father, but, um... I understand his concern.<eos> I lost my kids.<eos> And I would do anything to protect my grandkids.<eos> [sigh] Chayton, I've heard from, um... a reliable source that the case against you is strong.
You can't even go anywhere without this knuckle-dragger behind you.<eos> One kidney shot. That's... - Stay away from me, man.<eos> - All right. Stay away from me.<eos> Do you trust me?<eos> Trust you?
It was all a ruse to get Tom to recant his confession, get him back on my side. Our side.<eos> There is no our side, Cyrus.<eos> Michael, please.<eos> Did Tom ever see the letters?<eos> Did she ever show them to him before she gave them to you?
Pastor Ian's a, um... friend of my mom's.<eos> Said he was going to put me on the payroll.<eos> Wait!<eos> You're getting paid?<eos> Which I assume you're not.
Be right back.<eos> What's up?<eos> So do you still want my number?<eos> Not if you're weird.<eos> I'm no weirder than you.
And because of that, I want my next album to be a gospel album.<eos> And I would be honored if y'all would record it with me.<eos> - Wow. - Ooh.<eos> Thank you, Juliette.<eos> Thank you too, Hallie.
Yesterday was a big day.<eos> This is called a first moon gift.<eos> Oh, my God, Mom.<eos> It happens to everyone.<eos> I know, but this time it happened to you, so...
Would love to get it to her.<eos> What's the best way to do that, do you think?<eos> I'm happy to pass it along.<eos> That'd be great.<eos> I will send you an MP3 as well.- -
- Yeah, well, I think...<eos> I mean, I understand.<eos> I would be really upset too.<eos> - You have a nice day.<eos> - You too.
Pretend to be your friend.<eos> And then turn around and write something so personal like that about you?<eos> You need to steer clear of Mackenzie Rhodes, okay?<eos> 'Cause this is what she does.<eos> She worms her way into your confidence. And then finds a way to use it against you.
Ex-fan girl.<eos> Okay, Scarlett, look.<eos> They don't know who you are, like, really.<eos> And you're allowing yourself to get all wrapped up in this.<eos> It's almost as unhealthy as what they're doing to you.
Uh, just a manager looking for my... advice on something.<eos> Who would want your advice?<eos> You know, I think I might walk you into school today.<eos> Oh, no, you won't!<eos> J, I bow to you. "Water Rising" is on fire.
Honestly, I wasn't scared.<eos> I was angry.<eos> I was hoping that this wouldn't be so complicated.<eos> I don't want the house.<eos> Dad left it to you.
The car belongs to the university.<eos> You'll have to work it out with them.<eos> I did love that car.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I'm just happy you're all right.
Why not?<eos> Because... this is not... a relationship.<eos> This is... Une aventure.<eos> You don't owe me information.<eos> I don't owe you information.
I'm sorry.<eos> You fucking hate this place!<eos> Why are you here?<eos> Your grandfather left it to me.<eos> To you?
Since we're sharing secrets and all.<eos> I'm not the one running for Vice President, Jake.<eos> Of course not. That would be beneath you.<eos> You have a good evening, Liv.<eos> You, too.
Frankie was good.<eos> Killing Frankie is not putting the Republic first.<eos> Something about this feels off.<eos> My father killed Frankie Vargas!<eos> If I could ask anyone else to do what needs to be done, I would. But you are the only person I can trust.
How much time is left on the clock?<eos> About 2 1/2 minutes.<eos> Then you need to move, Huck.<eos> He's still in the trunk?<eos> I'd like to see where you'd be.
Am I a good boss?<eos> You want to blame yourself for this?<eos> Am I a good boss?<eos> Olivia, three years ago, I was at whatever below rock bottom is.<eos> I am where I am because of you, because you always had my back.
- I get it, Liv.<eos> - You don't.<eos> I lost!<eos> You wanted the Oval, and I didn't give it to you.<eos> No, I didn't give it to you!
You were right. I was rubbish.<eos> Are we ready?<eos> Yeah, we're ready.<eos> You can't watch that door forever.<eos> If someone had told you and mum to stop?
Of course it is.<eos> Of course it's still good.<eos> I'm delighted.<eos> The mayor will be thrilled. Does he know?<eos> I wanted to tell you first.
- I've got you...<eos> - Kara... No, no, don't talk.<eos> Just save your energy.<eos> There's something I need to say.<eos> Wherever I go... I'm gonna be better because of you.
I think it goes far beyond "the right thing".<eos> I couldn't have done it, Kara.<eos> You don't have to try to make me feel better.<eos> I'm not.<eos> I'm humbled by you.
And then if they don't, they're fucked.<eos> That's what Connerty thinks.<eos> And that's why I'm not in his office.<eos> Is that what Connerty thinks, or is that what he wants you to think?<eos> I'm hearing that multiple former AUSAs are gonna come forward against you.
You have won the people, Henry.<eos> And with this marriage, they will love you.<eos> And you already have an heir.<eos> There is one matter...<eos> God has shown me that you must relieve her of her mother, or she will poison the girl against you.
Trial and error. I'm your wife.<eos> I want to be obedient.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Nobody wants to be obedient.<eos> I do want to serve you and Fillory, but...
Okay, here's a lollipop.<eos> See you next time.<eos> Oh, Cassie.<eos> I'll let Sam know you're here.<eos> Oh, except I came here to bring something to you.
Was I, in my state of utter distress, babbling in tongues?<eos> Your friends are already dead!<eos> This is damage control.<eos> Either some of us die, or all of us do.<eos> You get the honor of deciding which one of those it's going to be.
Things are trending upward in the bloc.<eos> You're right.<eos> I'll have to remember to remain optimistic as we're all being renditioned.<eos> Find the pilot.<eos> It'll be good for you and your bloc.
Whatever wrong you've done, Doesn't matter to anybody.<eos> Until you decide, to go on living.<eos> 100,000 French Piastres.<eos> That's the biggest pot you've ever taken.<eos> However, no-one is betting against you, so...
They might just think you're crazy and lock you up.<eos> Well, then I better have a talk with myself... Face-to-face.<eos> My loft, 20 minutes.<eos> I'll be on the roof.<eos> Renard only has one thing he can use against you.
No, no, no, no, no, you can't take him!<eos> You don't understand.<eos> You have the right to remain silent.<eos> - No, don't take him!<eos> - Anything you say or eat will be used against you in the court of law.
Exactly.<eos> And where you gave me the key.<eos> Nick!<eos> I brought the key.<eos> Here, I'm giving it back to you.
And is the broodmare safely back in the stall?<eos> I must ask you not to use such terms.<eos> Elizabeth is much more to me than that.<eos> Which, frankly, baffles me.<eos> The thrall she's exerted over you and Francis, Ross -- I fail to see the fascination. - In fact...
I, of course, pay the whole cost of the boy's schooling, when he should by rights have sufficient income of his own.<eos> - From what?<eos> - His shares in your mine.<eos> Elizabeth sold his shares.<eos> Under pressure, to you, at a fraction of their worth.
I pity her. I want to help her.<eos> My conscience is sore, for I treated her ill.<eos> 15 years ago I would have given the earth for her, and she hasn't changed.<eos> She's no less lovely... .. but I have.<eos> I have changed because of you.
- One.<eos> - You have responded to the call to defend your country.<eos> - Two.<eos> - Can he be trusted?<eos> More to the point, can you?
You don't think we deserve more of an explanation?<eos> One job goes bad, and you're whining like a bunch of spoiled brats!<eos> What about the jobs that raised you all your life?<eos> You're still living off of Pendleton, every one of you.<eos> That was baz, not you.
Are you really that stupid?<eos> Are you really telling me that isn't what you wanted?<eos> If I wanted to rip you apart, you'd be in million pieces right now, because Jessica is gone, and you're not in my league.<eos> I offered the merger because my daughter has some kind of misguided loyalty to you, and I didn't want to extinguish that spark in her.<eos> If I'm not in your league, why is she loyal to us instead of you?
- Louis... - The funny thing is, all I ended up with was the shortest, most humiliating run as managing partner in the history of the world.<eos> If you ask me, you may have had a short run, but you made your mark.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Well, unless I'm mistaken, we have ten associates starting tomorrow who chose to come here over one of the best law firms in the city.<eos> They did that because of you.
I'm not ready either.<eos> What do you say we both act as interim managing partners?<eos> I'd be honored.<eos> It seems to me, the first order of business is, what are we gonna do about the name of the firm?<eos> I don't know about you, but... I think we should keep it exactly the same.
I have news that cannot wait.<eos> For the queen.<eos> Please excuse us, Lord Darnley.<eos> I've learned that John Knox is speaking this very day at a farm outside Perthshire.<eos> He intends to turn Catholics against you.
I can't give them what I believe each and every one of them deserves if I'm worried about all the complexities of your day-to-day.<eos> It's a lot, kid. I'm sorry.<eos> So what? You don't want to work together anymore?<eos> Well, it's just the current situation isn't fair to you, either.<eos> I can't commit to you 100% if I got other things on my mind, which unfortunately I do.
- Wrong caliber.<eos> Bag and tag anyway.<eos> Take it all.<eos> I don't know how you think you have the right to come up in my mother...<eos> Jamie's actions give me the right, and anything you say can be used against you.
Even the... sun. You know?<eos> It just kept coming up every morning, like it was any other day and the world hadn't completely changed.<eos> It's taken forever for me to feel normal again.<eos> How fortunate for you that you do.<eos> You will, too. It does get better, Kol.
I should've done this a long time ago. - Hey.<eos> - It's my fault that these girls are dead.<eos> Listen to me. You can't blame yourself.<eos> Okay?<eos> We're gonna find this guy because of you.
We go off your gut.<eos> She's kissing my cheek, and she's pulling at my belt.<eos> Then call it.<eos> We don't have enough?<eos> Vince's admission to you is not a confession of guilt.
They moved in.<eos> If it's the same guys who attacked us, with our guns, we could take them.<eos> I'm sure we could, but we didn't come here to fight.<eos> They butchered us, killed kids, our friends, our families.<eos> I don't like it any more than you do, but Bellamy's right.
even if Sinclair was still alive.<eos> Who... who the hell am I giving them orders?<eos> I'm... I'm not the Chief.<eos> I'm not the Chancellor, but here we are.<eos> For what it's worth, there's nobody I trust more to do this than you.
Here I am.<eos> Have I not helped you gain power, and keep it?<eos> You have, Sire.<eos> Why, then, do you defy my will?<eos> I do not defy you, Majesty.
When I look at a woman, I see only her soul.<eos> Let's put that to the test, shall we?<eos> How dare you!<eos> I wonder how the Queen would react if I told her you placed a hand on me.<eos> She would not believe you.
- He's perfect.<eos> - Yeah, and then you come along<eos> - and you expose him to all this...<eos> - Me?<eos> It was you who exposed him to so many amazing things.
I said the new director should be a powered person the public could trust.<eos> And they came up with you.<eos> Look, we're both inhuman.<eos> Why not make the most of it?<eos> The public was turning against you.
Well, I'm just saying, if you are ...<eos> I mean, it's not my comfort zone, but I'm good.<eos> I'll just tell the truth.<eos> I'm good at that.<eos> You?
The top watchdog himself.<eos> I've been waiting a long time for a face-to-face.<eos> ♪♪<eos> I chased the watchdogs, the funding, the weapons, the EMP, the senator...<eos> It all leads back to you.
Thank you.<eos> It was the best moment of my life.<eos> Do you think they'll ever be able to forgive me?<eos> Perhaps they... they need to make me feel pain to understand theirs.<eos> They may be able to forgive you.
And you did it.<eos> That's not all they're saying, though, you know?<eos> I know five women at work who've had miscarriages.<eos> Some of them were pretty far along.<eos> Yeah, well, that's not going to happen to you.
He didn't.<eos> He sent his driver, Nick.<eos> Be careful.<eos> A lot of the drivers work for the Eyes.<eos> He said I shouldn't trust you.
- How can you know that? - 'Cause Harvey is negotiating with James Palmer as we speak.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> Why is Harvey specter negotiating this?<eos> - I told you when we took him on, he's the best negotiator in the city.<eos> - I don't care who he is. You're the one that came to me.
It's... it's about the baby.<eos> I'm just worried I'll never be a father.<eos> I think that's a good place for us to pick up next week. - What the fu...?<eos> - Louis, calm down.<eos> No, I just told you my deepest fear is that my clock is running out, and all you care about is your precious time?
Now, you wanna tell me what's really going on here?<eos> Because Mike's not giving away his first case unless he's in a coma.<eos> The lawyer on the other side outed Mike as a fraud.<eos> - Meaning? - He brought out Mike's Harvard diploma, and he prejudiced the judge.<eos> So Mike thinks if he hands the case over to you, he takes that weapon out of their hands.
- You confessed to killing six people.<eos> One of which was your late husband. You still haven't<eos> - thanked me for that.<eos> - He was an innocent man...<eos> Who was getting in the way of you and the good detective's happiness.
I know this is a shock for you, Emily.<eos> Things will be easier for you now.<eos> You won't want what you cannot have.<eos> Fuck!<eos> Look, I'm sorry this is happening to you.
Call.<eos> One fifty.<eos> Call.<eos> You're drawing?<eos> Against you?
- I'm coming with you!<eos> - I will get him out.<eos> And if he is no longer the raging asshole we know and respect, I shall take care of it.<eos> It's my turn, Wynonna.<eos> You've had enough.
Two murders wiped off the boards!<eos> One mystery remains, though.<eos> Why are you dressed like a pirate?<eos> When I'm done, I'll buy you a drink, yeah?<eos> Not you, though.
Is he with you?<eos> He got caught in the explosion.<eos> - He's dead, David.<eos> - Shut up!<eos> But you made it out all right?
Nah, chica.<eos> But I'm hungry.<eos> Oh, you worked up an appetite playing Scarface, huh?<eos> That don't mean you get to skip the line.<eos> We all in this together now, thanks to you and that gun.
That's cool.<eos> The Hessians must've planned to camp here for the night.<eos> I'm so cold.<eos> I've never been so cold.<eos> - Why aren't you cold?
A small price to pay for the Spear of Destiny, don't you think?<eos> Imagine the power we would wield if we reunited the fragments.<eos> You mean Eobard Thawne.<eos> You're just his errand boy.<eos> It's a job that the Legion will reward me handsomely for, as they would you.
One Week. Barenaked Ladies.<eos> I've got to call Maggie.<eos> Hey, you did a great job with that decoding down there.<eos> Well, thank you.<eos> You did a great job with the de-Martianing.
Don't sell yourself short, J'onn.<eos> It's easy for the young to demand change.<eos> And you were open to it.<eos> You did your part.<eos> A lot of lives are going to be better because of you.
It's my brother.<eos> They've got him.<eos> No, you told me that you came here alone.<eos> I told you a lot of things.<eos> He's as good as dead now, thanks to you and your friends.
What's in it for you, ponytail?<eos> I know we've had our differences... But I've learned a lot from you.<eos> And the biggest thing I have learned is that it's not the reporter that matters, it's the truth that matters.<eos> And catco will get the truth to more people.<eos> Also, I wanted the truth to get out so badly that I disobeyed you.
You must be hungry.<eos> Mmm. This is a really good burger.<eos> I know you don't wanna be here with me.<eos> I'm just trying to help you, Marcus.<eos> I'm trying to help you and your mom.
Air Force One?<eos> Wait, don't tell me the President is heading towards the conflict and not away.<eos> Every time I think I can't get happier I voted for that woman...<eos> National City is mine, and you should be thankful that that is all I am currently taking from you.<eos> The militaries of Earth will unite against you.
I don't know, Bobby.<eos> I'm...<eos> The chunk of cash I need is on a statement with your name on it.<eos> The blind trust.<eos> Well, if this is what it takes... to help you and Ira...
He is the love of your life.<eos> You're talking in the present tense?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - What Kyle and I had... - Okay, I think I'm good.<eos> - You?
Please! Stop it!<eos> Dad!<eos> Please.<eos> You took Eric from me.<eos> Now I'm gonna take something from you.
- No can do.<eos> You know there will be severe consequences for this.<eos> You know that, Ruiz?<eos> Riots end, and inmates go to Max with years added to their sentence.<eos> If you help me, I will help you.
And come June, business improves incrementally... and I take a little more money.<eos> And then July rolls around, a little more money, but it's advertising for the Fourth.<eos> And then a few more units are rented... and it's better than nothing, but it's still not enough to service the debt on the loan I already owe the bank. A loan secured by the mortgage on this property.<eos> That old chestnut.<eos> And then, before you know it, it's Labor Day and I'm in hock to you and the bank and you force a sale, recoup your investment with interest.
What do you mean?<eos> M.K., your gift is the most powerful I've seen in a long time.<eos> But you're letting someone else control it.<eos> And tonight, you will discover who that person is.<eos> See, these mirrors show you everything you've ever done.
As far back as records go.<eos> Then, tell me. Do you also keep a record of how many it's killed?<eos> Please! The people know the ice is dangerous, yet they will insist on their festivities.<eos> That's hardly my fault.<eos> This is the biggest Frost Fair in decades, and that's down to you.
But if your future is built on the suffering of that creature, what's your future worth?<eos> Why is it up to me?<eos> Because it can't be up to me.<eos> Your people, your planet.<eos> I serve at the pleasure of the human race, and right now, that's you.
Yeah.<eos> Go get 'em.<eos> I will.<eos> Axe. Let's do dinner again soon with Savannah and Mike.<eos> When we're on, I have to get into all the action against you on the Nigerian play.
- It did.<eos> - Good.<eos> We need to discuss Kyle's directing plans.<eos> I've been doing a lot of soul searching and I really feel that we need to rethink our approach on this.<eos> Actually, I'm gonna leave that up to you.
Of course Jamie and Rory knew each other.<eos> They... They met through me.<eos> When was that?<eos> When I first started going out with Rory, about a year ago.<eos> So, through you,
Oh, I have motive and now I've got your boy<eos> - confirming you were up here with our victim.<eos> - He didn't actually see me come up here.<eos> You haven't got a single eyewitness.<eos> You know I'm going to pin this on you, Alan.
That's the kind of guy that's gonna open car doors for you and shit.<eos> Good thing I can open my own doors. What?<eos> You trying to tell me you ain't into that dimple of his? Please.<eos> Claire likes him, okay? So?<eos> That means you can't like him?
We got a lifetime of regrets to keep us company.<eos> - How was your day?<eos> - Fantastic.<eos> I discovered a whole new muscle in my back I hadn't pulled yet.<eos> You?
Now there's not even bugs.<eos> Well, fortunately, I'm not hungry enough for that to be upsetting yet.<eos> I actually kind of miss Polis.<eos> They had this drink there... Sweet, made out of sheep's milk.<eos> Ontari gave this to you?
I went ahead and ordered for us.<eos> She was seen entering your precinct and asking for you a day after Bianchi's arrest, and yet I can't seem to get so much as a return phone call from you.<eos> I'll give you a hint because I can tell you're having trouble with this.<eos> Give me a name.<eos> I'll give you a name.
Give me a name.<eos> I'll give you a name.<eos> Harlee Santos.<eos> Witness for the prosecution, appearing in court tomorrow to perjure herself in a mob case...<eos> - thanks to you.
We're on the same shooting re-qualification schedule.<eos> You shouldn't be due again for months.<eos> Yeah. It doesn't smell right.<eos> Out of the blue, they move it up to this afternoon?<eos> But you're good to go.
You working a case or running for office?<eos> No, no, I don't have the stomach for politics.<eos> I am formally opening a file on Donnie Pomp's disappearance, though.<eos> I look forward to interviewing you.<eos> I'm ready whenever you are.
I'm gonna need that drop gun of yours, the one that actually makes a set with the official ballistics.<eos> So you're gonna frame the actual murderer.<eos> That's rich.<eos> Do you have it?<eos> You think Bianchi's gonna come up and shake your hand and congratulate you for the win?
Not as high a price as his family.<eos> I'm done doing your homework for you, Harlee.<eos> But you're okay just standing by watching innocents get hurt?<eos> We're more often afraid than we are actually harmed, Harlee.<eos> I think Bianchi's just using your imagination against you.
Not a price I agreed to pay.<eos> - We need to clear out.<eos> - Do we?<eos> A couple hours ago, we needed to guard him.<eos> A few weeks ago, we needed to heist an armored car, and last night, we needed to forgive you.
You know, I was always scared to have kids.<eos> I didn't know anything about it, you know?<eos> How to take care of them when they come home crying, how to keep them safe.<eos> You know I never saw what that looked like.<eos> I am going to be a great dad some day because of you, and that's a hell of a gift.
Well, maybe you know somebody who does.<eos> Even if I could pry one open, it's a federal crime.<eos> Look, Stahl doesn't even feel like a man unless he's manipulating a woman.<eos> He crawls inside your head to all the places you feel safe, and he takes them.<eos> But you know that because he's done it to you.
I thought you enjoyed eavesdropping on my conversations.<eos> She is not well, Harlee.<eos> She doesn't know what she's saying.<eos> I think you should hear her out.<eos> I mean, I traveled all night to bring that here for you.
Previously on "Shades of Blue"...<eos> Sap, you're gonna have to cover for me one more time.<eos> Every day I'm alive I owe to you.
Hey, Loman.<eos> Thanks for that cover.<eos> Only supposed to work for a few seconds.<eos> Woz, what you did...<eos> We only made it out because of you.
It'll be a closed hearing.<eos> Okay?<eos> No one will ever know.<eos> You've got our word.<eos> Cop's word is only worth something when he's testifying against you.
Let her go.<eos> That's entirely up to you.<eos> Do what he says, please!<eos> Well, isn't this a nice surprise?<eos> I at least owed you a house call, don't you think?
It was stunting your growth.<eos> That's the point.<eos> Do you know how much tricks will pay to be with a little boy?<eos> I need you to listen to me, Sam.<eos> The things that happened to you, they're not your fault.
Where are you going?<eos> I've got shit to figure out, Wendy.<eos> The Blue Cat alone is not gonna cut it.<eos> What's up, ladies?<eos> Fuck happened to you?
Keep going.<eos> What is it?<eos> I've never felt more alive... ♪ If you have half a brain ♪<eos> I've never felt this free... to be who I am.<eos> And it's because of you.
Maybe. We'll both take losses,<eos> Kane and Bellamy among them.<eos> You think you can shake my resolve?<eos> I was willing to sacrifice my own mother to stop A.L.I.E..<eos> And I was willing to sacrifice mine to help you.
You are so blind.<eos> So desperate to dish out the blame.<eos> You are both as obsessed as each other, two peas from the same pod.<eos> Now, this bloody gold has taken its pound of flesh from all of us.<eos> It's all of us, not just you.
Or dead, like every other narco in Culiacán.<eos> I know the risks.<eos> I just lost my best friend.<eos> She's dead because of Epifanio.<eos> You've made it.
You are a fool if you think that trustworthy men are easy to find.<eos> I don't.<eos> Here. Pages from the book.<eos> It's now in my possession.<eos> If you insist in coming after me, I will use it against you.
Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us.<eos> Lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil.<eos> - Stop!<eos> Stop!<eos> - Save your children who trust in you, my god.
It's been far too long, my old friend.<eos> Ryo?<eos> Now Emperor Ishida Ryo of Zairon.<eos> Your step-mother?<eos> She'll no longer be a threat to you or anyone else.
Ours is an internal conflict between signatories.<eos> The rest of the League has elected to remain neutral.<eos> But not for long.<eos> I've heard the rumors.<eos> Some of your former friends in the League are starting to turn against you.
I know the darkness.<eos> It's ok.<eos> Let's go again.<eos> She'll be all right.<eos> Will you?
You take it.<eos> It's the least I can do for what I did.<eos> Thank you, Ilene.<eos> No.<eos> Thank you.
Kerry.<eos> Kerry!<eos> - Please.<eos> - How could you do this to me?<eos> - To you?
We need to get past this stalemate.<eos> I agree.<eos> You have to believe that I need you as a partner.<eos> I need your counsel, your perspective.<eos> I trust no one more than you.
No.<eos> I wanted to go back.<eos> It's my work.<eos> And when I didn't have it anymore, it... it left a hole I tried very hard to fill, but couldn't.<eos> So yes, I went back for me, but in doing it, I found a way to help you, too.
I'm not.<eos> All I'm saying is I'm really happy that you're... Son of a bitch.<eos> You okay?<eos> I just feel like crap, and all I want is coffee, and I can't even do that. No, it's fine.<eos> Hey, you need it more than me.
Move, move!<eos> Let me talk to your boss.<eos> Not happening.<eos> Move.<eos> The police launch an assault, a lot of people get hurt... mainly you and your friends.
Good morning, Augustus.<eos> Well, Eric, I...<eos> I'm sorry. They told me to sit, but, uh...<eos> Oh, no, no, no.<eos> It's perfectly fine. I... I can't imagine anyone else who would... well, enjoy this more than you.
What's in the safe room is our business, not your's.<eos> What are you trying to hide?<eos> Ever wonder why Dad never gave you the code?<eos> He made me promise not to give it to anyone, especially not... to...<eos> the goldigger especially not to you.
- No, no. I don't think it'll come to that.<eos> I know what they're saying in the village.<eos> "It's the Hinkin girl gone missing.<eos> They must have had something to do with it."<eos> Well, I won't take it from them... .. and I won't take it from you.
- Have you looked around?<eos> - Pardon me?<eos> - I was here when they rededicated this park in honour of you.<eos> Oh, yes, I was very impressed by the turn-out.<eos> And they talked about all the other things that happened because of you, like the fountain that you had restored or the clock that finally works on Main Street.
And I'm gonna give the people that work for me the same chance.<eos> - Thank you, Cassie. - Aww...<eos> Come back any time.<eos> - The kitchen can be all yours.<eos> - When I come back, - I'm going to leave the cooking to you.
Thanks.<eos> A bookmark!<eos> That's your big idea to help save me, is it?<eos> Well, you escaped, didn't you?<eos> Yeah, no thanks to you. Is that how you got all banged up?
You're an intelligent woman, you have skills, and you find it a bit of an insult that you're being asked to be a... baby vessel, right?<eos> Believe it or not, I'm very familiar with the feeling of being undervalued.<eos> I'll always be grateful to people who saw my potential.<eos> Gave me the opportunity to excel.<eos> That's what I'm doing with you.
No, I'm afraid not.<eos> I'd like to question her, if it's all right.<eos> You know, under any other circumstances, I'd have to say no.<eos> But nothing about this makes any sense.<eos> Maybe she'll talk to you.
- Because... No, shut up.<eos> You were gonna prove that even we can make a difference.<eos> That's why you came to D.C.<eos> That's why I'm here.<eos> Because of you.
Seriously?<eos> This again?<eos> All right.<eos> Come with me.<eos> I would've thought you'd be ready for a change in your team, considering how Goodkin used your mother's memory against you.
Think about who you were and who you are now.<eos> You got a chance to start over.<eos> And now, Roman does.<eos> This morning, you said Roman wasn't like me.<eos> All I know is Roman is alive because of you.
You like nice, by the way.<eos> Don't talk to me, don't look at me...<eos> Don't look at you?<eos> Come on, look at me!<eos> I'm a changed man because of you.
Thad, come on.<eos> This isn't you.<eos> You dick around with pharmaceutical prices, not war!<eos> Business is business, and thanks to my recent acquisition of Riley motors, business just got very, very good.<eos> - Zach sold to you?
So that's why I'm really here, Father.<eos> I was wondering if I could be so bold to... ask you for a little miracle.<eos> It's hot.<eos> I'm so hot.<eos> Are you hot?
Come on, let's go.<eos> Waiting two years for you to hand me something.<eos> I'm not sleeping on this.<eos> All right, give me a G.<eos> You officially ended our days as a cover band, boy!
You can't blame yourself, you know.<eos> Those deep cover agents, they volunteered.<eos> I don't.<eos> At least not anymore.<eos> And that's because of you.
And every life we save, it's a win.<eos> You taught me that.<eos> "The life of the dead is placed in the memory of the living."<eos> Marcus Tullius Cicero.<eos> And a lot of people are living because of you.
But I hope he still may.<eos> I know you don't believe that's what I want, Belle, but it's true.<eos> When Baelfire rejected my magic, I respected it.<eos> I just wasn't brave enough to follow it.<eos> My whole dark life, I've sought out those who are light... like you.
I would never put myself in a position to be in here.<eos> Nobody intends to be here.<eos> I'm just saying...<eos> you get hungry and desperate or broke and desperate, and stuff happens.<eos> Stuff does not just happen to you.
So she reached into her purse, removed a cloth, and washed my face.<eos> And... it was a miracle.<eos> To be touched when... you feel so untouchable.<eos> It was the first time in my life I wanted to live.<eos> And now, thanks to you... I just might.
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> You okay?<eos> You?
It's good to see you.<eos> Stay away from me.<eos> I have to apologize for what happened at the hospital, but the truth is I did save Kyle's life.<eos> I also heard about that unfortunate incident with the midwife.<eos> Now, I want you to know that if anything ever happened to you, or the baby, that would be a tragic loss for all of us.
Nothing but hide in my house.<eos> Well, enough of that.<eos> My house can topple off a cliff for all I care.<eos> Later.<eos> I am ready to be fierce and formidable again myself, and to face you, Count Olaf!
As we prepare for the Witness's return to us... the end, the story of the child begins.<eos> His cycle.<eos> And the child, like the man, shall be raised through time so he knows the world in its entirety and may return to us one day to lead us to salvation...<eos> The Forest of Red.<eos> Magdalena, it is to you we entrust the profound responsibility to guard and raise the child through time.
But... none of that matters because... I woke up with someone who... who thought I was a good person.<eos> And... And I'm not.<eos> So, what I did... What I did was... It wasn't good.<eos> I d... I did it just to prove to myself I could.<eos> And to prove it to you.
- Not very well at the moment.<eos> - What?<eos> Not enough you brought down an entire drug cartel today?<eos> Tasker's gonna make a deal?<eos> Thanks to you and Alice.
Harry james.<eos> Tom cummings.<eos> Alfred graves."<eos> I saw him in paris and poland.<eos> They left you in charge?
We'll talk.<eos> But I'm holding your people.<eos> My chancellor needs to be at that meeting, roan.<eos> Your chancellor's lucky he still has his head.<eos> Besides, if anyone can convince mortal enemies to move in together, it's you.
Including the essential personnel and the places that we're holding for the children under 16, that leaves us with 80.<eos> 80.<eos> I can't believe we're talking about sending 364 of our own people to their deaths.<eos> We're lucky they're giving us any space in this bunker at all. Look.<eos> I don't like it any more than you do.
Our people know how to operate oxygen scrubbers and hydro farms. - Yeah!<eos> - Yeah!<eos> We're gonna be running this place.<eos> We deserve more spots.<eos> I don't like this any more than you do, but we must call upon the better angels of our nature to guide us.
And Abby will be fine, too.<eos> Raven told her how to stop it.<eos> That's not what I'm talking about.<eos> If anything happens to me...<eos> Nothing is happening to you.
Any last-minute advice?<eos> Nope.<eos> Just tell the truth.<eos> Anything you admit here can't be used against you, so take advantage of that.
One more day might help you see things a little differently.<eos> - Yes, Mom.<eos> - Bye, honey. - Bye.<eos> Have a good day.<eos> - You too.
- Are you still with any of them?<eos> There you go.<eos> I've been told "I love you" by so many people that those words don't even mean anything anymore.<eos> Those words will always mean something.<eos> Well, then I'll leave it to you and the balloons.
And guess who has the key.<eos> Well, don't leave me in suspense.<eos> Who is it, brother?<eos> It says that God entrusted the key to his favorite son.<eos> Of course he gave it to you.
- Brother...<eos> - That Father's favorite, despite everything that you have done, is and always has been you.<eos> Look down.<eos> Is that the key around your neck or are you just happy to see me?<eos> He entrusted it... to you, brother.
Just not for me.<eos> God shattered the Flaming Sword into three distinct pieces.<eos> The Blade of Death, the Medallion of Life and the Key that binds them all together.<eos> Look down.<eos> He entrusted it to you.
For now.<eos> But they're out there, very close.<eos> The next time they call, we're gonna find them.<eos> I don't know whether to be relieved or terrified.<eos> Thanks to you, I know how it's happening, but it's only happening because these people, these killers live nearby.
Oh, yeah, well, that's great. Thanks a lot.<eos> That's just great.<eos> I'm cold.<eos> Here. Take mine.<eos> No, no, no. Then you're gonna get cold.
Good.<eos> Okay, jammer's back up, and dedicated signal... established.<eos> Okay.<eos> "Congratulations, Angela.<eos> No one got hurt thanks to you."
I love you.<eos> Officer Rose, this is my associate, Maxine Carlson.<eos> You were amazing back there.<eos> No, I...<eos> It was you that gave me the courage to do it.
Is this what you want?<eos> I can't... Breathe.<eos> What was that? I-i couldn't hear you.<eos> You-you can't breathe?<eos> Oh, you help me, and i help you.
Shanked it.<eos> Seriously?<eos> Can i help you?<eos> No, i don't think so.<eos> But i can help you.
Tell me, what sort of an eternal life would that be with that stain on your conscience?<eos> So, innocent people lose their lives because you're too thick to read the small print in your deal with the devil.<eos> I... I had faith I would find a loophole.<eos> And I did.<eos> And I am more than grateful to acknowledge that I owe all of it to you.
I hack...<eos> Still, I-I... I don't quite know everything.<eos> I still don't quite know precisely where Ichabod Crane has taken my gun.<eos> Would you care to tell me where he has taken my...<eos> Okay, we've trusted you.
All right, all right.<eos> All right, rest here.<eos> Mom always said you had a flair for the dramatic.<eos> Yes, well, your mother is incorrigible.<eos> (chuckles) And thanks to you, I am no longer bound to the Horseman of War.
So trust me when I say you do not want to go up against me.<eos> Good day, Mr. Bell.<eos> I wouldn't be who I am if it weren't for you, that's true.<eos> You should know I'm not afraid of you.<eos> Not afraid to go against you, either.
- Sorry. Sorry.<eos> Dinesh, I think you accidentally disabled my access keys for the video chat data repository.<eos> No, actually, I deleted them on purpose.<eos> I purged all our ex-employees.<eos> Gleb, Sanjay, Elisabet, you.
I'm not personally liable.<eos> Although...<eos> Although what?<eos> Well, when you lied to me about adding terms of service, it could be argued you violated your fiduciary duty to the company, rendering you personally liable.<eos> I mean, if the FTC brought us to trial, I could be compelled to testify against you.
He may sweep for those.<eos> I do have a colleague at Facebook that has a laser microphone.<eos> You can point it at an office window from a mile away and read the sound vibrations.<eos> I like it.<eos> Hoover, you're the only person I can trust at this goddamn company.
Aethelflaed, hear me.<eos> There will be no rest.<eos> None. A life with Erik is what I want.<eos> It is best for me and it is best for Wessex.<eos> I can say this to no-one but you.
And perhaps within me.<eos> And if over the coming months, my husband should think what you are thinking, it would be a great comfort, Uhtred, to know that I could call upon you again, should I ever need to.<eos> Of course.<eos> Do you swear?<eos> You are the man I trust most, Uhtred of Bebbanburg.
No!<eos> She believed in you.<eos> She trusted you.<eos> She died because of you.<eos> And nothing ever happened to you, did it?
What happened to the Doctor?<eos> - I thought I saw him...<eos> - Yeah, he...<eos> The Doctor took you to safety.<eos> He gave you his helmet.
And when I do, you will spend the rest of them wondering who I was and why I helped you.<eos> If anyone's offering a better deal, be my guest.<eos> You didn't save Tasker, did you?<eos> And he believed you.<eos> Trusted you.
You don't need blind followers.<eos> What you're interested in is loyalty.<eos> I've worked with Craig.<eos> I'm loyal to him.<eos> Take me on, I'll be equally loyal to you.
Gabriel asked me how you took the news about the guy in the lab.<eos> What'd you tell him?<eos> I said you're fine.<eos> Are you fine?<eos> Are you?
How?<eos> We checked.<eos> But you're right.<eos> There are risks.<eos> There are real, long-term things we can offer you.
I still can't get over that report card.<eos> I know.<eos> Did you ever think that he'd be doing better than Paige? It seems like she's over Matthew.<eos> Well, that's good.<eos> Does Tuan ever say anything about any girls to you?
Okay... Easy, easy, easy, easy.<eos> Jeez.<eos> Stop!<eos> Rufus is gone.<eos> So I guess I got to trust you.
What do you mean?<eos> You... you know the details.<eos> You were there with me for every single pitch meeting.<eos> And I'm sorry that I wasn't key in those meetings, so I don't recall all of the little nitty-gritty details.<eos> Saving you 25 percent on your data storage, which makes us pretty deserving of the Weissman trophy.
Do you?<eos> Do you actually fuck your dumb machine?<eos> - Is that the secret on your phone?<eos> - Fuck you.<eos> - Fuck you!
- Believe me, I wanna get in there.<eos> It's... it's above my pay grade.<eos> - Penny, Silvia. - You really don't need my help?<eos> - With what? - Trying to break into the poison room.<eos> - I am telling you the truth because you are the one I trust, and I really just need your support right now.
- I've seen what he can do when he's angry.<eos> - John, tell her what you told me about our lady underground.<eos> - Reynard's obsessed with her.<eos> I think they were lovers, but she left him.<eos> Everything that he's done to her followers, to you...
To hell with this.<eos> Sebastian! No! No, no, no!<eos> No, no.<eos> They kicked you out?<eos> Yeah, thanks to you.
- Just promise me, okay?<eos> - Yeah, promise.<eos> How can I help you, honey?<eos> You can't help me.<eos> I'm here to help you.
But you will.<eos> Sorry?<eos> I promised her I'd protect her.<eos> From you.<eos> Now I'm promising you, one way or the other, you're gonna pay for this.
Yeah.<eos> Took us long enough, but we finally agree on something, huh?<eos> Still, despite the few... disagreements, it's been a real pleasure, Agent Pride.<eos> Likewise.<eos> I am going back to D.C. with a very big win, thanks to you.
What about it?<eos> I just don't know how it's gone MIA.<eos> We went into the house...<eos> Yeah, you arrest Gerry, you take his phone.<eos> - Then I gave it to you.
- Okay...<eos> I think that you have been working too hard...<eos> - no, I haven't.<eos> I haven't. I am telling you the truth.<eos> Because you are the one I trust.
Whatever you are, if I am what you say, don't hurt these people.<eos> Hurt them?<eos> No.<eos> Never.<eos> I froze them so they wouldn't hurt themselves... or you.
He can be your mole. But to do that, he'd have to be alive.<eos> _<eos> He'd never know.<eos> Whatever you need, ask me about it.<eos> He tells me, I tell you.
Colt's gonna be a dad.<eos> What the fuck, dude?<eos> I got a text from Mary.<eos> I didn't wanna ruin it for them.<eos> I did wanna ruin it for you.
Great idea.<eos> See you at 5:00.<eos> Thanks, asshole.<eos> Yeah, I didn't wanna ruin it for him.<eos> I did want to ruin it for you.
Bet you're disappointed you didn't get rid of me in that impromptu police raid.<eos> Taking a page out of Mein Kampf, I see.<eos> I was defending myself.<eos> No, you're defending a corrupt police state run by that egomaniac you work for.<eos> Okay, well, thanks to you, I don't work for him anymore, so we can just be done with this.
- Say what now?<eos> - You know, I'm...<eos> My business is more Gold Coast than Green Street, but isn't protecting customers part of the job?<eos> If you work with us, we get this guy.<eos> If you don't, people might start to turn on you.
Gotcha.<eos> Hey, Dante!<eos> Yeah, you.<eos> Chip...<eos> Get out of here. Look, I got nothing against you, personally.
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Thank you.<eos> You're the reason this wasn't a disaster.
Us?<eos> You are no longer a part of "us," rollo.<eos> But what is "us," floki, is changing.<eos> Only you won't accept it.<eos> And so I say the same to you.
- Are you mad?<eos> - I may be.<eos> But since I love some of you, I urge you again to take heed of my warning.<eos> The sons of ragnar are sure to come!<eos> As for you, sweet sister, I counsel you, have a care for your own soul.
You are now playing with a much weaker hand.<eos> I took 40 towns in 22 days.<eos> But not the prize, Amsterdam.<eos> You are fighting on two fronts. Your troops are exhausted.<eos> You are unable to advance, running out of supplies and half of Europe is joining an alliance against you. I too have allies.
We shall see.<eos> Are you afraid that he might cast a shadow over you?<eos> Who told you that?<eos> Do you know why it is so easy to acquire information about you and what you're planning?<eos> It's because there are so many people willing to turn against you.
Do you know why it is so easy to acquire information about you and what you're planning?<eos> It's because there are so many people willing to turn against you.<eos> Like the Chevalier de Rohan?<eos> No.<eos> He did not turn against you.
- Not yet.<eos> The contract is everything.<eos> We need total concentration for it.<eos> You know it's taken a lot of work to get here.<eos> Especially by you.
You're down to hoping I'm gonna act like the biggest stooge in a B-movie?<eos> Your outfit said "Give it a shot."<eos> Grandson of the demon's head, you are not.<eos> You're an entitled brat.<eos> I rose from nothing while you had everything handed to you.
I suppose I just did.<eos> Mnemonics is spelled with an M.<eos> Not that you need my help or anything.<eos> Have a good weekend. [chuckling]<eos> You, too.
Need my help with anything? Anything I can do?<eos> Just take care of yourself.<eos> And come home someday.<eos> Hope everything works out.<eos> For you, too.
Oh, for heaven's sake, Rollings, these are my guests!<eos> Come in, come in, come in from the cold!<eos> I was beginning to think you weren't coming.<eos> Oh, my dear Anne, it's very good to see you.<eos> Dear me! Whatever's happened to you?
I confess to Almighty God...<eos> And to you, my brothers and sisters, that I have greatly sinned...<eos> And it's now that God changes the bread into the body of Christ and the wine into His blood.<eos> There's going to be a bell that we ring here, and that dates back from the old days, where everything was in Latin and no one knew what was going on, so the bell meant "this bit's important".<eos> For on the night he was betrayed... he himself took bread... and giving you thanks, he said the blessing, broke the bread and gave it to his disciples, saying,
We're totally committed to Doing things properly... With the thoroughness that you deserve.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It must've been hard for You over the years, helen.<eos> Yes.<eos> Having a son so paranoid that He didn't even trust you,
But my daughter'll have A roof over her head.<eos> Unless you know what that feels Like, or you've seen it...<eos> You know, a guilty conscience Is a small price to pay for it.<eos> I'm sorry, michael.<eos> For on the night he was betrayed... He himself took bread, and giving You thanks, he said the blessing, Broke the bread and gave It to his disciples saying,
And they will kill him if I don't pay up.<eos> So let me help you, all right?<eos> But start by lowering this weapon before I take it and feed it to you.<eos> - You think I trust the cops?<eos> - No, but you trust Trish, and Trish trusts you.
Doesn't seem like your kind of scene.<eos> It isn't, but I'm always up by the end of the evening, because these lads just bet on their mates.<eos> Claire thinks Louis is going to divorce her.<eos> She thinks or she knows?<eos> Has he said anything to you about a woman?
Please, have my card. Please, have my...<eos> Please, have my key.<eos> Yes!<eos> I just can't. I'm sorry.<eos> You're sorry?
_<eos> And about how long would you say they were in the building?<eos> I saw them come in, word got around, and we just started clearing out.<eos> I-I didn't stick around to find out what happened.<eos> Okay, well, was there anybody unfamiliar to you that left in that group?
- Yeah.<eos> Well, you know, between Ruzek and Roman, you've been a badge bunny, so I don't know if you're tough enough for Intelligence.<eos> Well, then get ready to eat some crow, Al.<eos> How are you?<eos> Better now that you're here.

You don't need that trash.<eos> Trash?<eos> They add a whole new dimension to the sound.<eos> Come home.<eos> Help your mother, and let me help you.
I think I believe it, 'cause... 'cause when I, I went to the other side, I... I think I saw my mom.<eos> I... I believe in angels, but I don't know if I believe in God.<eos> God saved my life just the way He saved yours.<eos> When you hit rock bottom, that's when God shows up the most.<eos> He showed up for you and kept you alive.
Get off!<eos> Get off me!<eos> Y'all were fire last night.<eos> Yeah, but Alex did a great job of updating the song.<eos> And thank you, Cott, for making us look hot.
- Not the right kind.<eos> Do you want to be known as some football player's piece of ass?<eos> Our likes are sky-high, and we're trending off the charts.<eos> No.<eos> You.

Arlene.<eos> She's out of control.<eos> Yeah, she is.<eos> She's showing her ass 'cause I'm in here.<eos> And you felt sorry for her when I used to knock her upside the head.
- Get off of me!<eos> - She don't want to go with you.<eos> Miss Carlotta, please!<eos> What'd I do?<eos> Nothing, you just got me tripping.
How them girls doing?<eos> I'm worried.<eos> Mama, you in jail.<eos> Why don't you stop thinking about those girls for one second and start thinking about yourself?<eos> What's gonna happen if charges is brought against you?
Why would I do...<eos> You're the only one who could place my car at that site.<eos> I didn't tell anyone else where I buried that body.<eos> - You brought me back to my roots!<eos> You brought me back to my music.
You ain't going to jail, Jahil.<eos> God is good.<eos> I'm messed up about them girls, Lottie.<eos> But you know, I guess I deserve it.<eos> After what I did to you and Mary.
Listen, I thought about what you said about my dad, and you're right.<eos> Yeah, I was.<eos> In fact, you won't believe who I'm with right now.<eos> Uh, you won't believe who I'm with right now.<eos> Thanks to you I'm sitting right next to my dad.
Your... your dad is sad.<eos> He's...<eos> He's secret sad.<eos> My dad left when I was little, and I'm okay.<eos> You will be, too.
The hospital has cable, so...<eos> There you go.<eos> I just wanted to come by and let you know they're charging Benoit today.<eos> Yeah, he's going away for a very long time.<eos> - Thanks to you.
- Exactly.<eos> And Nolan knows where all the bodies are buried in this bloc.<eos> We'll turn him and then explain that his only chance is to give up something on Alcala.<eos> Well, it's nice to see that you didn't lose your gift for political maneuvering while down in that camp.<eos> I'm just trying to serve the Authority and you, of course.
You did it.<eos> Sure did.<eos> You should've told me about your U.N. position.<eos> What does it matter?<eos> This man is free because of you.
I can't do this without you.<eos> Then don't.<eos> Or better yet, ask Justine.<eos> Look, if Ethan is crooked, then he's a perfect target for the FBI.<eos> Plus, Alice is far more likely to believe Justine than she is you.
That's good, right?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> It means you're willing to serve Jesus no matter what's asked of you.<eos> Jesus?<eos> Here I was, thinkin' I was just helpin' you out.
- Finally. Good for you, huh?<eos> - And you.<eos> - I can send you guys some men.<eos> - No.<eos> No, man, we trust you.
Tell me what the hell is going on here.<eos> Heather, I'm a Federal agent.<eos> We have credible Intel that there's a hit out on you.<eos> You got to trust me.<eos> Why on earth should I trust you?
- how to live with how things are.<eos> - When did you start selling chocolates?<eos> When I decided I wanted to be known as someone who sells something other than flowers.<eos> - Did you find the place?<eos> - Yeah. Thanks to you.
- He's such a great guy.<eos> - I didn't realize how much I missed him 'til I saw him again.<eos> Well then, it's a good thing you found your way to Middleton.<eos> Yeah, well, it was finding this place that made me decide to stay.<eos> So I'm kind of here thanks to you.
The, uh, the one who sent the flowers.<eos> We're kind of on the outs.<eos> You don't need to feel guilty for your social life.<eos> I just don't like seeing you like this.<eos> Look, I... I know I don't have much, but what little I do have, I owe to you.
The same country that tried to cover up my father's death?<eos> What, you think I was doing this for America?<eos> I only defected because Shepherd became what she was fighting against.<eos> Well, then stay for revenge.<eos> For what she did to you, what she did to Markos.
Our numbers are growing every day.<eos> Mother, this could be the key to freeing Mandalore from Imperial control.<eos> I am not a traitor.<eos> I want to save Mandalore too, but it needs a strong leader.<eos> You have to trust me, just like I'm trusting you.
Believe me, if you'd kept her, she'd be griping about something else.<eos> Hostility and reproach with occasional moments of pride...<eos> That's the mother/daughter bond for you.<eos> Did you say pride?<eos> Well, thanks to you, I'm still breathing, aren't I?
- 28A.<eos> Listen, Krystal.<eos> I know you can do this, all right?<eos> I believe in you. Just for the love of God, keep it in your pants, okay?<eos> Congratulations to you too, brother.
Witness after witness is gonna rebut whatever you have to say.<eos> My testimony is what it is.<eos> It'll all be resolved in the court of public opinion.<eos> Yes, but who is the public going to believe?<eos> You or explosive residue on a terrorist's computer?
I was the last person to see Aidan.<eos> He confessed to me.<eos> He secretly used the NSA, FISA, to manipulate the electorate.<eos> We're meeting with counsel to perfect the rest of the testimony.<eos> As long as no one has anything that contradicts you.
Buy some time till I figure out what I'm gonna do next.<eos> We can figure something out.<eos> I bet.<eos> You know, those parts you blacked out, that's...<eos> -I've never told anyone but you.
All my ex-husbands were accomplished, serious men, but bone-dry.<eos> A day hasn't gone by that Frank hasn't made me laugh.<eos> I hope I keep up.<eos> - Oh. - But who am I telling?<eos> You got lucky, too.
Okay, vamanos!<eos> Kid loves that cape.<eos> So, I see your stance on sons wearing accessories has evolved.<eos> The cape gives him superpowers.<eos> What did leg warmers give you?
- Well... - Oh, God!<eos> It's so gross, though, you know, when you touch it.<eos> - Uh, you know, I could,<eos> I could hold off, I could hold off for a minute.<eos> Maybe you should hold off a minute.
If Olson comes in begging for a plea deal, he knows.<eos> If he wets his khakis when we screen the video for him, he...<eos> Peter Stone?<eos> - That's right.<eos> - We're seeking to enforce a writ of replevin against you and your office.
It seems redundant, but they're all yours.<eos> Keep me apprised.<eos> - You okay?<eos> - Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> You?
It's Christmas, Robert.<eos> 'Tis the season to give.<eos> Be careful, uncle.<eos> I'd be wary about alienating the new guard with old tricks.<eos> It could work against you.
- I don't.<eos> The sex is one thing, but I'm no good at relationships.<eos> - And I can't be in one, not with you.<eos> - Everything was so good.<eos> - Everything was so good for you.

Gavin and I played Euchre.<eos> Before you killed him.<eos> Gavin was a brilliant accountant.<eos> And an even better man... who worshiped you.<eos> When the Feds came asking questions about the nature of his relationship with me, his only thoughts were about whether you and your children would be safe and well provided for.
From getting information on his other cases and clients, victims.<eos> Aram, you did the right thing.<eos> She's the reason we were able to find you.<eos> Hey, uh, Janet...<eos> I'm probably only alive because of you, so... thank you for that.
Yeah, but she hasn't even admitted that she's a virgin yet, so...<eos> Well, then get her to.<eos> Come on, Goldy.<eos> It's 10k off your debt if you can pop her cherry in Dixie.<eos> Now the rest of you ladies will be making video invitations explaining to Adam why you would like him to meet your family.
But in her mind, that's attentive nursing.<eos> - Only a skilled nurse knows...<eos> - Excuse me!<eos> - What is it?<eos> - I have something for you.
It's in the museum.<eos> Video art.<eos> Edwina Collin, American painter.<eos> Imagine a traditional Christmas meets a hand grenade in slow motion.<eos> - Do you like Christmas?

I want to be a grandpa, you know, someday.<eos> - Dad first and then...<eos> Right.<eos> This may be the best/worst Valentine's Day I have ever had.<eos> Which one of you is Donna?
Would you look at that?<eos> That's the first time I've seen Dalia smile in weeks.<eos> L.O.L., Schulman.<eos> Perfect!<eos> Anything else we can do for you ladies today?
Ms. Ramos?<eos> Detective linnell.<eos> I'm the lead on your son's case.<eos> We're gonna need someone from the family To positively I.D. The body.<eos> It only has to be one of you.
If that is your child's gift, to guide us down these alternate pathways, then this is truly what I've always dreamt of seeing.<eos> A moment of punctuated equilibrium.<eos> An evolutionary leap forward.<eos> Your child could be that leap.<eos> Well, you know... you know, I'm not one of these blue marble ladies.

Your accomplishments are hardly a matter of interest to me.<eos> I see.<eos> I could have a few words with the Crown, I know he'll listen to me.<eos> I could advocate leniency on your behalf.<eos> - Both of you, actually.
It's just temporary.<eos> She will get back to the normal after treatment.<eos> In fact, some guys will suffer from Postpartum Depression too.<eos> What will it be?<eos> The same, you will have many illusions.
- Take a listen.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Pleasedon't.<eos> I'll give you your money back!<eos> Um, have either of you ladies ever, um, surfed the rail yards?
No, no! The drugs were planted by her evil former sex client.<eos> Oh...<eos> And you two are... ? Um, Mark's sisters.<eos> We were there at the time of his arrest.<eos> Did either of you actually see this alleged... evil former sex client tamper with Mr. Holland's suitcase?
You looking for your husbands?<eos> Uh, no.<eos> Actually, we're looking for their wives.<eos> Excuse me, ladies.<eos> Might I trouble one of you for a cigarette?
It's a simple cervical swab-- takes less than 10 seconds.<eos> Lillian here is far better versed in the medicine than I am.<eos> What were you telling me earlier?<eos> It's called the pap smear.<eos> Maybe some of you ladies have heard of it.
Yes.<eos> Do you know somewhere Gertie can wait it out?<eos> They'll be watching the trains at Ashford Junction.<eos> - Oh, you'll help?<eos> - I will not see you incommoded.
- Good morning.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> - I'm Mr. Stein.<eos> I'll be presiding at this consent and capacity hearing.<eos> Which of you is Dr. Bell?
I need to be certain.<eos> Positive. 100%.<eos> Your pal know you're on to him?<eos> No...but he will.<eos> I hate to be offsides here, but, uh, one of you ladies is about to call me for holding, and that's a 5-yard penalty.
It'll only make it worse.<eos> Who is it?<eos> What are you?<eos> My name is Alma.<eos> Can you take down a message for Mr. Goodman?
But we expected better of you!<eos> Ladies, let me...<eos> It is no wonder that you wish to keep us excluded.<eos> But they have purchased many gifts.<eos> For you!
I serve still God, my lady.<eos> That would please my father.<eos> He would not like to see blood on a cardinal's hands.<eos> So why are you here with the French armies?<eos> I am in your presence to invite you both to dine with His Royal Highness, King Charles of France.
Look, I'm here now.<eos> Let's just get this over with.<eos> All right.<eos> Please.<eos> Someone will be with you in a moment.

So you share with Mlle. Debenham in berths 10 and 11?<eos> Ja.<eos> That Englishwoman does not pray.<eos> I prayed she needs to pray.<eos> Neither of you left the compartment last night?
What about your prints?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe russell borrowed some of danny's balls.<eos> I didn't get the impression that they were that friendly.<eos> How'd you wind up on danny's bag?
The videos prove Battal Bey is right.<eos> I'm tired of seeing it.<eos> He has nothing to do with this.<eos> Let him go, Murat.<eos> Battal Bey, you can leave after your testimony is written down.
I mean, if Elisa's only flaw is that she demands I be faithful then I will be faithful!<eos> And if Angie wants me to get a tattoo of her to prove my love then I'm getting that tattoo!<eos> Grizz, get the car.<eos> Dotcom, get the coats.<eos> And which one of you ladies wants to pick up the tab?
What else comes in?<eos> She's burning up.<eos> It's 3:00 in the morning.<eos> She's really hot.<eos> Which one of you is the mother?
He's gonna play with his Batmobil.<eos> Is it okay if she goes too?<eos> She's okay back there with the boys. ?<eos> toilet underneath them. . I'm sure they'll be fine.<eos> Which one of you is the mother?

It's called A Cougar's Guide to the Hunt:<eos> Bagging a Man in the Urban Jungle.<eos> I'm sure you're all familiar with it.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Well, as part of our investigation, uh, I'm going to need to know where each of you were on the nights that each of these killings took place.
- What name?<eos> The one that Jane thought was so important? VAN PELT:<eos> Wendy.<eos> - Right, Wendy.<eos> Either of you know a woman named Wendy? - No.
- You know, we actually have a "Woman In The Wood" puzzle that was made especially for Angie by the artist Julia Condon. She's one of our favorite artists.<eos> Isn't auntie Julia one of our favorite artists, sweet pea?<eos> - Yeah, playing.<eos> Yes, you're playing.<eos> - That's wonderful. Does one of you have a deaf family member?
For example, only one sweater to a window, as opposed to windows stuffed with merchandise.<eos> My father's going to love that. Believe it or not, it even applies to the mannequins.<eos> Bendel's takes the heads off theirs so the shopper can imagine them to be anyone.<eos> Anyone without a head.<eos> Along with these cosmetic changes, you'll also need to provide what we call boutique extras.
My sister is dead.<eos> And I am alone in the house.<eos> And I do not know when my father will come back, and all I can think about is his face...<eos> I thought I would be stronger the next time the good Lord had his way but now it has happened I find I cannot manage it any better this time than I did the last.<eos> And now I have come unto you, my sister is left untended.
He'll come to. He's just overjoyed with the suddenness of it all.<eos> You do not look quite certain, Jem.<eos> We were meant to be saving up.<eos> Well, there'll be no need if we get ourselves a nice, quiet lodger.<eos> Which is why we've come to you today.
Wow, a mint condition Hippie Hulk from 1968!<eos> Tune in, turn on, Hulk out!<eos> Oh, man, this town's got everything!<eos> Hey, hey, LBJ, how many pants you rip today?<eos> Any of you ladie like stereo music?
Thanks a lot for joining us today.<eos> I'm sorry to disturb you.<eos> I'm Coach Ken Carter of the Richmond High School basketball team.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> I need to ask you a favor.
There is tell of a mystical place, far north of here, called Northampton.<eos> Exciting, because it contains a shoe factory struggling to survive against all the odds.<eos> Daring, because it's run by a man brave enough to recognise that a factory is its people, not its bricks.<eos> And sexy, well, because now I work there.<eos> And the craftsmen of fantasy, for ladies, gentleman, and those of you who are yet to make up your minds.
Barring that, I really don't see any reason to turn down this request.<eos> There are some ethical considerations.<eos> Like what?<eos> Organ donation is generally an anonymous transaction.<eos> Removing your daughter's face, her identity, and transferring it to a relative stranger could be a disaster for you both, let alone Hannah.
- I got it from Charlotte.<eos> - I got it from Anthony... but I told him you and Marcus were very much in love.<eos> Charlotte was still a cheerleader for love. But like the Knicks, her team was having a bad season.<eos> Well, you think you know somebody...<eos> Excuse me, which one of you is Annabelle Bronstein?
I'll just do the bottom three lines.<eos> F, L, E, P, T, P L, E, P, F, L, F, L, E, P, T, P, L, F, E, T."<eos> Do you think oysters would be too much for the first date?<eos> -You have 20·10 vision, captain.<eos> -These are just for looking at you.
I'd like to get a proper file going. I've some questions, and so must you.<eos> I'll try and explain as much as I can.<eos> This is a game.<eos> It's a game you play, whether you like it or not.<eos> For you, it's emotional. For the people holding Peter, it's a business.
Is this the kind of world We want to live in? Is this the kind of water We want to drink? Where the mercury content Is 27 parts per billion.<eos> And it makes you glow in the dark.<eos> I don't think so. Jinx! - Allyson.<eos> Melanie. - Both: thanks. Soi ask you, ladies and gentlemen,<eos> Edward, I am sorry to report Your granddaughters are more persuasive Than you are.
Whoa, man. What stinks?<eos> Did I say it was you?<eos> Man, this water is freezing.<eos> I'm gonna catch a cold.<eos> Which one of you ladies wants to warm me up?
The minimum is two drinks.<eos> Each.<eos> In this case, melmaciano want a martini.<eos> If you do not have cat meat, can serve as a ferret.<eos> Very well, then you have.
Yeah, well, you can forget about it.<eos> You're sick!<eos> Get out of me.<eos> I'm Detective Barnett of the police.<eos> Would any of you know the whereabouts ofJay Batton? He's a TA here.
No, no, please, please don't worry about me, Miss Garrideb,<eos> I'll just stay there.<eos> Oh, well then, plenty of cushions.<eos> Let's plump them up a little more comfortable, I'm sure.<eos> No, no please don't let me... don't let me keep you awake.
She came here to purchase me as a sex toy.<eos> Oh, this is impossible.<eos> Someone wants you for sex?<eos> What, do you have a pet orang-utan who's lonely?<eos> Oh, I'm sorry. You two weren't properly introduced, I don't think.
You've concluded Your meeting.<eos> Um, skies are clearing-<eos> Come on, ladies. Sit.<eos> Sit down.<eos> And we've prepared A fine meal for you tonight.
Good night, Mr. Maranov.<eos> Your sister is a remarkable woman.<eos> She does not make small talk. She's unforgivable.<eos> No.<eos> I should not have intruded on you this morning.
It'd be a nice way to say goodbye.<eos> I have to leave tomorrow.<eos> Column, halt!<eos> Good afternoon, ladies.<eos> Which of you is Mrs. Main?
I've no wish to reward rebelliousness, but for good of discipline it seems that I must.<eos> Perhaps this new family of yours shatter this dream world you that you live in<eos> Now, get into your nightgown and go to bed.<eos> Are you waiting for someone, Miss?<eos> I am, thank you. Would you prefer to sit in the ladies' waiting room?
Mother's right. Those people Charlotte and I met at the pensione, they were all rather extraordinary.<eos> 0ur neighbor and friend, Sir Harry 0tway, has a villa in Summer Street for which he needs a tenant.<eos> - I immediately thought of you.<eos> - "The house has the added attraction "that it stands exactly across the road from the Reverend Beebe's church.<eos> "I told him of my plan to lure you hither, and he is in complete agreement
- These ladies are looking for you, ma'am.<eos> - What happened?<eos> The wagon broke down about a mile back.<eos> I've got most of the things in here.<eos> Get the ladies' luggage, quick as you can!
"Charmed to make your acquaintance. Lovely place you have here."<eos> Good afternoon, gentlemen.<eos> - Cornelius Hackl here.<eos> - Barnaby Tucker here. Irene Molloy here.<eos> I'm very happy to meet you.
- I don't know.<eos> I thought it just sounded distinguished-like.<eos> the scouse of distinction.<eos> madame.<eos> but these young men I'm sitting with... wondered if two of us could come over and join you.
Will you excuse me?<eos> Please.<eos> The young lady has become very pretty.<eos> It's been such a long time since I've had the pleasure.<eos> But what can I do for you?
You usually don't see them this far down the river.<eos> - Something must have scared it.<eos> - Us, perhaps.<eos> No, they are used to my boat.<eos> Although the jungle doesn't often see someone as pretty as you.
And don't get any cute ideas.<eos> These are on me.<eos> This is an old friend of mine, Jeff Markham.<eos> He wants to ask you something.<eos> - Which one of you is Eunice Leonard?
Hi. We're here about the a/c unit.<eos> Sorry. A/c unit?<eos> I don't see a note or anything.<eos> Well, someone called our dispatcher and said there was a weird smell coming from it, so we're just here to take a look.<eos> I don't have you on the schedule.
Not to mention, your bid was far too attractive for us to pass up.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I mean, that's great to hear because we really worked hard on this.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> One of you just said our bid was too attractive to pass up.
The vaccination is done here for the fourth year in a row, no accidents.<eos> We probably won't find anything interesting here.<eos> Good afternoon.<eos> We need doctor Semyonov.<eos> I am listening to you.
Gentlemen, J. Griffin, agent in charge.<eos> In charge of what, exactly?<eos> This task force.<eos> Task force for what, exactly?<eos> What can I do for you, detective?
Here.<eos> You're fucked up, man.<eos> - Quit it.<eos> - Good morning, Mr. Hammerschmidt.<eos> How can I help you?
Okay.<eos> Mrs. Underwood.<eos> Mr. Tusk and Mr. Danton have a proposal about how to deal with Russia.<eos> I imagine I'm the last person you expected to see today.<eos> I am a bit surprised, yes, to see both of you.
Yes, Victor!<eos> I own you!<eos> You belong to the circus!<eos> Good morning.<eos> Can I help you?
That Smiley fellow, he don't joke around.<eos> Oh... I joke around... but never when it comes to my business.<eos> Welcome to the Gold Nugget, gentlemen.<eos> Mr. Harris, it's quite a nice spread you got here.<eos> So what brings you gentlemen to town?
In our search of his property, we recovered a large quantity of crystallized methamphetamine and cannabis.<eos> Would your son have told you if he was a drug dealer?<eos> I'm Judge Sean Henlow, and this is the arraignment calendar for felonies, misdemeanors, and infractions filed in stanislaus county superior court.<eos> Before we deal with each case on the calendar today,<eos> I'm going to talk to you about our court procedures so that you have at least some idea of what to expect today and in the future.
I... I wasn't aware of any new gland extract.<eos> It's an interesting substance that's been taken from the glands of several animals by a Pole named Cybulski.<eos> I have no idea what he calls it, but we're calling it adrenaline.<eos> You'll help us learn if it has any practical uses.<eos> So, unless there are any other questions, I'll see some of you on grand rounds and the rest of you at second meeting.
It is my hope that it will establish Norrellite magic for the modern age.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Yes, I believe do.<eos> You are the madhouse-keepers?<eos> I have a letter for you.
The tomb.<eos> Good morning, Governor. It was.<eos> I trust the tremor in the night didn't disturb your sleep?<eos> Not for a moment.<eos> Now... What brings you here, gentlemen?
Only married couples get to bicker like 12-year-olds, okay?<eos> So knock it off.<eos> You must be here for TJ.<eos> I'm Lisa Kelly, the administrator.<eos> Uh, which one of you is Jamie? That's me.
Allman.<eos> And this is Agent Betts.<eos> Sister, you're aware of the recent string of deaths, right?<eos> Yes, a terrible tragedy.<eos> But I'm confused as to why you're here.
Uh, well, to celebrate our divorce, I'd like to get my ex-husband an engagement ring for his on-again, off-again girlfriend.<eos> Oh, and I might need your card, in case I propose to my girlfriend, his ex-girlfriend, our social worker.<eos> Also, do you validate?<eos> We do.<eos> So, what kind of cut were you thinking?
Neil.<eos> I think I'm in love already.<eos> That would have been a clean 50 from the both of you.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Which one of you is Dr. William Blunt?
That's weird.<eos> I don't think you'll want this gift, then.<eos> It's a negligee.<eos> No, that's fine.<eos> And just let me say again, what an honour it has been to perform for you gentlemen and that it would be a privilege to be brutalised by teenagers on Murder Time.
- out of left field. - There is one.<eos> Madam Secretary, I'd like you to meet Staff Sergeant Bill Thomas and PFC Joseph Hoffman.<eos> These were the two Marines that lowered the American flag when the embassy closed in 1961.<eos> I thought they should be here today when we raise it again.<eos> Gentlemen, it's an honor to meet you.
Gentlemen, it's an honor to meet you.<eos> I can't imagine two people I'd rather have here today.<eos> Happy to serve.<eos> Never thought I'd see this day.<eos> Gentlemen, if you'll follow me, I'll show you to your place.
I was actually hoping that you and I might have a word.<eos> By all means.<eos> I was just going to get some coffee.<eos> Well, let me join you.<eos> Uh, anything for you two?
I can't really talk to you while you're underage drinking.<eos> - Of course. - Yeah.<eos> And it'd be nice to keep this quiet on both ends, if that makes sense.<eos> - Totally understand.<eos> - Yeah. I really look forward to not making eye contact with you tomorrow at school.
Of course not.<eos> I always knew there'd be a good explanation.<eos> I beg Madame Bonacieux's forgiveness.<eos> I trust nothing of the kind will ever happen again.<eos> I'll see you to the door.
"We must meet up. 0400.<eos> You know where.<eos> Don't call me."<eos> That's the message you sent me.<eos> Actually, it's the same message that I sent both of you.
Well, look at that.<eos> You speak of the devil, and he shall appear.<eos> Mr. Jane, Ms. Fischer.<eos> To, uh, what do we owe the pleasure?<eos> Did either of you deal directly with Dan Becker?
Same price either way.<eos> Oh, I-I'm sorry.<eos> I-I'm looking for Mitchell.<eos> Oh, yeah, he's expecting you.<eos> In fact, he's asked me to draw the two of you a bath.
Evening, Mrs. Sibley.<eos> You're out late.<eos> I'm often sleepless.<eos> And I find the... night air calms me.<eos> And you two?
Detective. Alicia, I'm in awe of your offices.<eos> Very... youthful.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Makes me miss private practice. Almost.<eos> So... what brings you here?
I was never here, alright? Alright?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Liz Birdsworth?<eos> This is the police.<eos> Can I help you?
A pleasure.<eos> My colleague.<eos> Caterina Boldieu.<eos> Enchanté.<eos> Mr. Martin... Monsieur Dassin... Mr. Novik will see you now.
But my brother needs help.<eos> You have to find him.<eos> It's done.<eos> [GOTHAM MUNITIONS FACTORY]<eos> I have a delivery for you.
For the UK you need to have a passport.<eos> No, but the UK is a soft touch, famously.<eos> Anyone can get in there.<eos> I am sorry.<eos> They will not let you on the ferry without a passport.
This is the final boarding call for Emirates flight 2046 to Dubai... at gate d-30.<eos> Final boarding call for flight 2046 to Dubai.<eos> Hiller brood is the top... private intelligence firm in the world.<eos> Anti-corporate terrorism is all about risk.<eos> Our job is to assess that risk for you.
Lead on, maestro.<eos> Can I have your right hand on my right shoulder, please?<eos> And your friend hold on to your shoulder. Thank you.<eos> Mind the stairs and be prepared because it's completely dark.<eos> Okay, gentlemen, if you don't mind, I can sit you here beside these two young ladies.
- to cover up Operation Geneva.<eos> - Genoa.<eos> - Fuck me!<eos> Well?<eos> Would one of you fuck Miss Halliday, please?
- You're already an ATM!<eos> - I told you, we had to do this the proper way.<eos> You could've worn a tie!<eos> They watch these videos!<eos> What can I do for you today, gentlemen?
The gong is rung at seven and we meet in the drawing room at eight.<eos> You know it's Robert's birthday?<eos> So you must try to be witty tonight, Mr Blake.<eos> After that, we'll lower our expectations.<eos> The girls will show you up.
Everybody back away.<eos> - Is it real?<eos> - They took me to breakfast on the way to the airport and told me Jack signed off.<eos> And he's high enough at Chevy he doesn't have to run it by the whole outfit and--<eos> Bob Benson to see you both.
Very, very good.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Good afternoon.<eos> Sorry for the interruption.<eos> Uh, I assume one of you speaks English.
Would you have preferred that we let him get away? That's not the point.<eos> I give you both a lot of rope, and I would hate to see you hang yourselves.<eos> Where's the third blind mouse?<eos> He had some paperwork to catch up on. Another likely story.<eos> You know, I don't want to see you in here tomorrow.
The person you're with...<eos> Oh, he's our group's Chief Assistant.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> My name is Yoon Jae Hoo.<eos> It doesn't seem like you were in an important meeting.
Would that kill them?<eos> You're the queen.<eos> You can just tell the lords the princess is not ready for this.<eos> In fact, she might not ever be ready for this, so that's that.<eos> Good day to you.
Jack came home and threw up after that.<eos> He couldn't believe he still loved her after what he saw, but he did.<eos> You're Ward Ward's boy?<eos> Most contrary man in all of Moat County.<eos> What may I do for you gentlemen today?
And this is, uh, Think Outside the Box.<eos> You know it.<eos> L live by it.<eos> Hi, we have an appointment with Mr. Kauffman.<eos> Yes, they're expecting you.
Hurry up!<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> This way, sir.<eos> Inspector Shekhawat!<eos> What brings you here?
Harry from Manchester. - From Manchester?<eos> Oh, we've got a range... a range of locations.<eos> Okay.<eos> One whisky.<eos> I'll come round in front of you.
Can I get either of you gentlemen anything else?
Are you the girl's mother? No.<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> - Where is the mother?<eos> - She doesn't know her daughter is here.<eos> Then is one of you the girl's father?
- Yeah, I know how it goes.<eos> - Everyone hates me now, and it isn't fair.<eos> - I know.<eos> I just feel like if people could see me in action again, they'd realize I'm not a fraud.<eos> - Here you go, kofelbread and-a sausages for you.
He's a good kid.<eos> He's been in a bit of trouble before, but that's lairy drunks picking a fight cos they know who he was.<eos> Last assault charge against him was dropped!<eos> You wait here.<eos> We don't need both of you inside.
We have a man fitting your brother's description in the mews, dealing drugs, the night of Amanda's murder.<eos> I don't believe that.<eos> I don't give a fuck whether you believe it or not!<eos> Your brother is now the prime suspect in the murder of Amanda Delany.<eos> Any more lies, right, any more forgotten shit, you'll both be charged with perverting the course of justice.
Hardly a teacup.<eos> The lunchtime edition, just in.<eos> I see.<eos> What do you tell your wives when they ask why you are home so late?<eos> It was good to see you last night, Mr Roberts, and you, Mr Grogan.
Hey, man, I'm sorry to put you guys out like this.<eos> What's the trouble with it?<eos> No clue. I was just driving down the road. All of a sudden, the old cow just bellied up and died on me.<eos> Either one of you guys know about engines?<eos> Oh, of course you do. That's why they call you an engineer, right?
Yes?<eos> Mrs. Westen.<eos> I'm Agent Harper with the CIA.<eos> Officer Castro here is Miami P.D.<eos> What can I do for you?
Edwin, a pleasure.<eos> My son, Robert.<eos> And I believe you already know the lovely Elizabeth Haverford.<eos> Well, it's a pleasure to see you again, madame.<eos> And you as well.
German beer.<eos> Of course.<eos> Yes, it's bitburger.<eos> The best.<eos> What brings you to Argentina?
- Stay the hell away from my daughter. - Ow.<eos> You stay away from my daughter.<eos> - I don't even know you. - Stop it.<eos> Oh, my God. That is not... What are you grabbing?<eos> So... Okay, wait. Which one of you is Lindhagen again?
I truly am. I won't take any pleasure in seeing you ruined.<eos> That proposal is only valid for three days.<eos> No amendments, no negotiation.<eos> Now, gentlemen, I have taken up enough of your Saturday.<eos> Stephanie will see you out.
Do you really think this'll work?<eos> Well, we've gotta smoke her out of her hiding place somehow.<eos> Every eye in the department is on your place.<eos> Thanks, Detectives.<eos> This is probably a big inconvenience for you.
More importantly, we've had a nice walk around camp david and gotten to know each other.<eos> As they've told me, he's a pretty charming guy.<eos> He put the charm offensive on me.<eos> I- - - and it worked.<eos> A question for both of you.
Men of violence.<eos> That's a hell of an assumption to make...<eos> No assumption. Not at all.<eos> You misunderstand me, I said you are men of violence<eos> I'm not accusing you of being violent men.
Tuesday!<eos> No, it's Sunday, to be sure.<eos> Fine.<eos> It's late. I'll just find somebody to drive me in the morning.<eos> So, if one of you can direct me to the nearest hotel? Or bed and breakfast?
You just thought you could forget it and we'd all go away.<eos> Well, I'm sorry, but it isn't gonna be that easy because we're not going anywhere.<eos> We're goanna do what we said we would.<eos> No more overtime and an immediate 24-hour stoppage.<eos> And where it goes from there, well, it's up to you.
CHRISTIAN: You mean this?<eos> - I want it.<eos> I really want it. CHRISTIAN:<eos> Sure, we can have it...<eos> [DAN GRUNTING] I should have warned you.
Tollie would never kill himself.<eos> A friend of yours, sir?<eos> Very much so, yes.<eos> You look oddly familiar.<eos> Anyway, there's nowt for you to do here.
Mr Shephard.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - And you must be David.<eos> - We're set up in the conference room.<eos> I've got a surprise for you.
Yo, Sandra Bullock, I think this is my stop.<eos> Can this be any worse?<eos> No!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> There's really nothing we can do for you.
The teller cages are nicely protected, but your employees need to be more vigilant.<eos> Also, the staff should wear their access badges around their neck, not clipped to their waist...<eos> It makes them too easy to lift. And the old dye packs you're using are way too easy to spot.<eos> And, guys, the pass codes need to change daily, not weekly.<eos> Each of you have received a card like this in the past week from someone calling himself The Architect.
Oh, of course.<eos> I know exactly where I was.<eos> And I would be happy to tell you, providing you can get a warrant based on some bizarre connection you've made between me, an anonymous business card, and random questions about Russian art.<eos> Now, if you'll excuse me, I, uh, have too much time on my hands.<eos> Whitney can show you out.
He doesn't attend anymore.<eos> But it is a sought-after invitation from industrial buyers.<eos> They come, they meet, exchange ideas.<eos> Deals are made.<eos> Either one of you have any idea where Iverson was going after he left the airport?
- No, no, it's my fault. It was my fault.<eos> I set it down on the counter.<eos> Could've happened to anybody whose also from Iceland.<eos> Nice to meet a fellow national.<eos> If you two gentlemen would please follow me to security, we have a few questions we'd like to ask you.
Smells like... like broccoli or something.<eos> Here's your drink, sir.<eos> The bartender took extra special care of it for you.<eos> Is there a problem with your ventilation or something?<eos> You know, I don't know, but I will certainly check on that for you.
Jonathan, I consider myself a very open-minded friend.<eos> Half the people I know are disturbed.<eos> But you cannot just go around and say that you're a detective.<eos> You can't mess with people's lives{\ like that}. You can barely lead your own life.<eos> Which one of you is Ray Houston?
I did repel his fetters and denied his access to me.<eos> That hath made him mad.<eos> I am sorry that with better heed and judgment I had not quoted him. I fear'd he did but trifle, and meant to wreck thee, but, beshrew my jealousy!<eos> Come, go we to the king. This must be known. Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern!<eos> Moreover that we much did long to see you, the need we have to use you did provoke our hasty sending.
By arresting Rayburn.<eos> Who do you suggest would do this arresting?<eos> I'm sitting in a room with the United Nations,<eos> Nato, the EU, and the Kosovo government.<eos> Which one of you gentlemen would like to draw the straw?
What have we here?<eos> Hello. Just backing up and turning around.<eos> Hey, we're gonna do this...<eos> (EXCLAlMlNG) lt's not for you.<eos> (speaking FRENCH) I took the liberty of preparing for you a cheese platter, which I will place here on the eastern wall of the conference room.
Oh, we're not salesmen.<eos> Agents Page and Plant, FBI.<eos> Put your badge in the slot.<eos> Your partner's too.<eos> What do you want?
- Then you should do that.<eos> I think you'll be pleased.<eos> That's why I didn't want to do this on the phone.<eos> I love what she says, and I love the way she says it.<eos> Let me walk you out.
- Does it?<eos> - I insist.<eos> Well, if you feel that strongly about it, I'll press ahead. ...and engage the extra security on your behalf. On the condition that if the auction does go ahead without incident you bear the cost in full.<eos> Do we have a deal?<eos> Your tee time is booked and the chauffeur will bring you back. - As soon as you're finished.
Right there. Right there!<eos> - That's the one.<eos> - You think so?<eos> Look at this.<eos> How're you doing?
So, did the devil happen to mention to you... what this semen demon's special powers are? I don't think so.<eos> Okay, 'cause my head is goin'... to some pretty awful places with this one.<eos> We'd like to become donors.<eos> Fill these out.<eos> Just so you know... we have an extremely rigorous selection process.
Now your... your immediate resignations will be accepted, gentlemen.<eos> I do not feel it my duty to resign.<eos> Excellent.<eos> Then you leave me with the far more satisfying remedy of removing you from office.<eos> Both of you.
Just use your witch strength, slave.<eos> Yeah, it's not that much further.<eos> God!<eos> Uh, pardon me, pardon me, good sirs.<eos> But which of you gentlemen happens to be the highest ranking military officer here?
Wait and see what happens when you become old and ugly. Anyway....<eos> Well, have we got a hotel, then?<eos> Are we organised?<eos> Welcome!<eos> Did you have a good trip?
- Hey, that's mine!<eos> - Hands off! Hands off!<eos> - Son of a bitch!<eos> - All right. Problem solved.<eos> - Good luck to the rest of you.
It's crazy.<eos> Good afternoon, gentlemen.<eos> I'm Hot Stone.<eos> She's Shiatsu.<eos> - Can I freshen up your drink for you?
So if you can't change that reporter's mind, the saddle's going on.<eos> - You're wounded.<eos> - It's not my blood.<eos> - How is he? - Somebody did some heroic field surgery.<eos> A bullet that close to his artery.Which one of you?
Well, I guess that's it then.<eos> You know what, Mr. Wells-<eos> I think that's enough.<eos> Thanks for your time.<eos> I'll see you out.
You are not going to smash it up.<eos> This was never your daddy's house.<eos> He just let you believe it.<eos> Then whose house is this?<eos> Now, which of you gentlemen is going to bring me the tools?
She was meant to come over for her tea, but never did.<eos> -Did you phone her? -Mm.<eos> She's a good girl.<eos> She always keeps in touch.<eos> -I wouldn't bother you otherwise.
Ah Herr Klimt, we haven't seen you for quite some time.<eos> Have you reserved?<eos> No, we haven't.<eos> I'm afraid we are unforgivably spur of the moment.<eos> I'm sure we will find something for you.
This is Dr Jain, a dear friend.<eos> Also, a famous burns specialist<eos> And his team.. this is Dr Rashid<eos> We're here to help you in any manner we can<eos> You're most welcome, sir. It's an honor to have you here
- Oh, do you have 2%?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Same, please.<eos> - Okay, great.<eos> You two with the dinner specials are welcome to go to the salad bar.
Mm. It's a literary reference...<eos> from a book.<eos> Um, I guess I can talk while I change.<eos> Meet me over there?<eos> Only one of you.
- Listen, dunderhead.<eos> You don't give a guy in a motorcycle helmet a million bucks<eos> - unless he's got a shotgun in his hand.<eos> - I wish I had a shotgun in my hand.<eos> What kind of investment opportunities are you looking for?
Now I would have seen if someone went to a burner.<eos> God damn it!<eos> If we just stayed up on the wire two months ago, we wouldn't be going through this sh...<eos> Can I help you?<eos> Which one of you is Sergeant Hauk?
We try not to keep people waiting so long.<eos> I should tell you that I never speak without a lawyer present, so you'll understand if i respectfully decline to answer your questions.<eos> You've both invoked your right to counsel which makes an interview impossible.<eos> So I'll just have a theoretical discussion with lieutenant tao here.<eos> I don't really have any questions anyway. Just some good news for one of you,and some very bad news for the other.
Thanks for the advice. But no.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> To beg Elena's forgiveness.<eos> Goodness me.<eos> Might one of you be Don Alejandro de la Vega?
Why would the director of the FBI send you instead of coming himself?<eos> Probably because I found that Cleo was pregnant.<eos> - You could tell she was pregnant?<eos> - We found foetal bones.<eos> The only question, Senator, is which one of you is the father?
Signora Guidicelli, she will be coming back, won't she?<eos> You think so, monsieur?<eos> I have a message, sir, from the Opera Ghost.<eos> God in heaven, you're all obsessed!<eos> He welcomes you to his opera house
And commands that you continue to? leave Box Five empty for his use and reminds you that his salary is due.<eos> His salary?<eos> Monsieur Lefevre used to give him twenty thousand francs a month.<eos> Twenty thousand francs?<eos> Perhaps you can afford more, with the Vicomte de Chagny as your patron.
At least not guilty enough to kill myself.<eos> I can justify my doings.<eos> And I'd like to do it for my family.<eos> All right, I'll have you arrested.<eos> Does any of you want to write anything for the good-bye?
- Kill anything in our way.<eos> - What's gonna be in our way, the family mutt?<eos> - This is Wolfram and Hart. - [Doorbell Rings]<eos> Odds are there's something ugly behind that door.<eos> Can I help you?
-Good morning M. Bertin.<eos> -Gauguin.<eos> -We have conducted an experiment.<eos> -indeed?<eos> I'd be glad to see you both at your desks.
5 hours' sleep in 5 minutes. No kidding, it energizes.<eos> The lesson is over.<eos> See you later, Captain.<eos> Thank you, Qiu.<eos> What can I do for you?
Never mind, we're here.<eos> K.C. Calden, Hollywood Homicide.<eos> We're here to see Antoine Sartain.<eos> He's in recording studio B, I think.<eos> -ls he expecting you?
-I could be huge again.<eos> -You're still huge to me, Mr. Duran.<eos> You got 72 hours to sell my house.<eos> -Thank you.<eos> -Let me show you the door.
Who should I tell him is here? Zinedine. Zinedine Zidane.<eos> Zinedine who? - Zidane.<eos> And everyone ate and drank, and they all went like this just because it was nice.<eos> Abraham had seven sons, and they ate and they drank, and they all went like this... Good evening.<eos> Which one of you is Mr. Zidane? Me. What can I do for you?
These gentlemen have paid a small fortune to watch you compete, mr. Mulwray.<eos> I trust you won't disappoint them.<eos> Why don't you come in here so i can give them a preview, warden, huh? Come on in, warden.<eos> Warden! Yes? We need to talk.<eos> Gentlemen, if you'll excuse me, i'll be right with you.
Now I'm not here to make any political or religious statement. As a matter of fact,<eos> I'm not here to make any statement at all.<eos> I'm looking for someone.<eos> A woman by the name of Galina Konstantin.<eos> Any of you men would remember her.
- So, what are we drinking?<eos> - Beer.<eos> We can do better than that.<eos> Sir, a bottle of champagne, please.<eos> I'm sure one of you gentlemen will help me pop my cork.
Great definition, carriage.<eos> I'd love to paint her.<eos> Good, good.<eos> But what about this deadbeat?<eos> There's no problem cropping you both out.
I'm changing the 24-hour rule. OK? No, no, no.<eos> You don't understand. She's a missing person. Missing meaning that someone's looking for her.<eos> You get it?<eos> I'm changing the 24-hour rule.<eos> May I help you?
They're expecting you.<eos> Go.<eos> That guy had me in diapers for over a month!<eos> What the hell was that?<eos> - General Woodman's expecting you.
How are you doing?<eos> Can you step away from the door, please?<eos> Yeah, we got a call about the music.<eos> I don't hear any music.<eos> But we'll try to keep it down for you.
Otis, fetch the ring. I will announce at midnight.<eos> - Invitation, please.<eos> - Uh, hello.<eos> My name is Stuart Besser. I'm sorry, I know we're not on your list but his sister is Kate McKay;<eos> - ...she works here. - I'm sorry, sir, I can't just let you in.
A walk? That's a really good idea.<eos> - Hmm? Hmm. - [Tires Screech]<eos> Do you take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife?<eos> [Together] I do. One groom - Two grooms?<eos> But he- But you can't- Oh, my medication! [Groans]
Miss Crock, I'd like you to meet Gunn Froling, Erland Vetterlund, Per Malmsjo and Bertil Guve.<eos> The executive team from Copenhagen Snak Food. Well, I'm just flattered that you're even considering my little factory.<eos> Lovely output.<eos> That's terrific, Gunn. You are truly a Great Dane.<eos> Come, gentlemen, I'd like to show you the Bun room. I'm sure you'll love it.
Excuse me.<eos> Right this way, gentlemen.<eos> Dr. Oseransky, I'm Sergeant Buchanan.<eos> This is Officer Morrissey.<eos> Yes, well, what can I do for you?
Tales of his glory came roaring from the Nile northward, to the banks of the Niemen, where a wall... of Russian troops beat back these tidings, that for Russia... were worse than a plague.<eos> When Napoleon takes snuff then you can tell, that for his troops the battle's going well.<eos> For instance, at Austerlitz, regiment after regiment galloped on and fell.<eos> For each regiment that fell, the Emperor took a pinch.<eos> If one of you gentleman ever serves... a day in his army, remember that!
By the end of October... the whole district is going to be torn down.<eos> Be prepared.<eos> Offiicial notifiication should be vey soon.<eos> Sory, I've got to go.<eos> - Will the three of you be bathing?
Yeah.<eos> There can be with removing a breast.<eos> I'm not discounting the psychological impact.<eos> Actually, I think you are just a bit.<eos> You'll see most male surgeons find it relatively easy to lop off a breast.
- Sir...<eos> Ke'ra wants nothing more than to help her people.<eos> As long as she doesn't take the antidote...<eos> - There won't be one without her help.<eos> - So... it's up to you, sirs.
Who are you?<eos> Do we get a parking ticket?<eos> Karen Lee.<eos> Executive VP, International Sales, V-Six Jeans.<eos> I realise this is difficult for you, but try to think.
By my head, here comes the Capulets.<eos> By my heel, I care not.<eos> Follow me close. I will speak with them.<eos> Gentlemen, good-den !<eos> A word with one of you.
- By my head, here comes the Capulets.<eos> - By my heel, I care not. Follow me close.<eos> I will speak to them.<eos> Gentlemen, good-den !<eos> A word with one of you.
- Here you go, take this.<eos> - If you'll still in pain in about 10 minutes, give us a call.<eos> - And... - We'll get back to you.<eos> - Stop, wait, just a minute!<eos> - I wanna give you this homemade bread I baked for you.
- I can't help!<eos> I'll stay here in case there's trouble again.<eos> I need you to translate for the technical stuff. Anyway, he won't have time to trick me.<eos> Good morning!<eos> Which one of you is Mr Kruger?
I've been looking everywhere for you!<eos> - What were you doing?<eos> - Developing photos. Photos?<eos> You have to do that now?<eos> The French President awards you the medal of Knight of the Order of Merit.
It occurred to me that since you were on the other side during the civil war you might feel some, I don't know obligation to help replace some of the fighters we lost during the campaign.<eos> Who said I was on the other side?<eos> Well, I didn't hear your name mentioned by anybody on our side.<eos> Anybody else think this food tastes funny?<eos> So you think there are only two sides to any argument?
Have you started having contractions?<eos> Not yet. I heard they really hurt.<eos> Do they?<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Which of you is the father?
- Is he your husband or something? - No, he's not my--do you know where he is?<eos> Most likely, he's in the dining room, okay?<eos> "Dirt road. Chokoloske road. Go along the bank.<eos> let me see that, Joe.<eos> Gentlemens, I've gots the wine for you.
Get on with it, John.<eos> We ain't got all fuckin' day here.<eos> I have taken the liberty of setting up for our use a number of accounts in Havana, Cuba.<eos> They are impervious to the scrutiny of the feds there.<eos> At the request of my employer, Lucky Luciano, I hereby offer these services to each and every one of you.
Bobby used to be an out-of-work actor, high on drugs, beating up paparazzi who wouldn't take his picture. Then he found Selfosophy. Learned how to reject rage and anger and focus on more meaningful emotions.<eos> Now he's rich and famous and dating high-priced fashion models.<eos> In fact, many of Hollywood's elite are Selfosophists.<eos> How could a religious order with ties to Hollywood be involved in anything immoral?<eos> But don't worry. I think I have something that will prove useful to you.
They have us in a tractor beam.<eos> Repolarize the hull.<eos> Try to shake us loose.<eos> Ah... are we glad to see you.<eos> Could one of you point us in the direction of the wormhole?
A little proverbial salt in the wound.<eos> You're looking well.<eos> Go!<eos> I'm not going to leave you.<eos> It was a pleasure treating you.

Now, what is it?<eos> Deverell is smuggling' chemical weapons in from Russia.<eos> I made the contacts for him.<eos> The deal's being brokered by the Russian Mafia.<eos> Would one of you gentlemen mind calling' me an ambulance?
- Nice to meet you.<eos> And these are my associates, Mr. Chong Rashid Abdul and Rabbi Meyer.<eos> - It is a pleasure, commander.<eos> - Well, thank you.<eos> Now if you'll follow me, we've set up temporary quarters for you.
- Well, thank you, sir.<eos> You didn't tell us he lived next door.<eos> You didn't ask.<eos> Paint.<eos> Excuse me. Have either of you seen this man?
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> I want to start by sincerely thanking you for your patience through this long and emotional proceeding.
The bleeding in his chest and belly has slowed, So, fortunately, We've been able to back off of the transfusions.<eos> Is he gonna pull through?<eos> Well, it is still too early to tell, But we are fighting the good fight.<eos> Now, if all continues to go well, Ortho will be able to start treating his bone fractures. Tomorrow.<eos> Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got to get back to my patient.
50 of sux, 10 of etomidate.<eos> - On it.<eos> - Can he hear me?<eos> Dustin!<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. The doctor will be with you as soon as she can, okay?
We've already told you everything we know.<eos> This may be difficult for you to hear.<eos> Julie-Ann may have been trying to kick her drug habit because she was pregnant.<eos> Oh, dear God.<eos> I take it neither of you knew?
This way, please.<eos> Dr. and Mrs. Einstein.<eos> Thank you for coming in on such short notice.<eos> I'm Deputy Consul General Raymond Geist.<eos> It's a real honor to meet you both.
What happened to the last one?<eos> Who could remember?<eos> Hello!<eos> Yes, I'm calling from the Clios Art Foundation.<eos> We have a vault with you.
Right, yeah.<eos> Go ahead and pay the lady out front.<eos> Cash is always appreciated.<eos> How the hell does this thing work?<eos> Question for you.
I don't know. I mean, without Ness, this is just...<eos> Lucy?<eos> I know who we can ask.<eos> I'm so sorry to bother you so late, but are you by any chance Richard Hart?<eos> What can I do for you?
We have a common problem.<eos> And I'm offering you a solution.<eos> Think it over.<eos> In a series of gangland killings, the brutality and carnage of which authorities are saying is unprecedented in the Dallas area.<eos> I must warn you: the following images are very graphic.
No, Desmond's never been further away from home<eos> - than Grand Rapids.<eos> - None of us has.<eos> Okay, well, we'd like to start your son on a round of IV antifungals right away.<eos> But I do have to warn you, it's strong medicine with the potential of side effects,
Paige is just a girl from school.<eos> Come on in. You know the drill.<eos> I certainly do.<eos> So strong.<eos> Well, it's very nice to meet you all.
- Here they are. - Look who it is.<eos> - Alice!<eos> - Hi! How are you? - Oh, my God.<eos> We're here to celebrate.<eos> - How are you? - It's so good to see you.
- Yes sir.<eos> - Start.<eos> We have a breaking news alert.<eos> We have breaking news live.<eos> We have an image for you.
They'll be wondering what happened to me.<eos> You'll visit me though, yeah?<eos> Yeah, course I will.<eos> See you, son.<eos> We have one final act for you tonight.
Wow, that's a lot of fucks.<eos> Fasten your goddamn buttons.<eos> Actually, Max, the mistake people make in these situations isn't fucking. It's feeling.<eos> Have you been waiting long?<eos> Herr Hobar will see you now.
But the other girl, you don't know the identity of the other girl.<eos> And therefore it's Merry?<eos> Go home, Mr. Levov.<eos> This is my daughter.<eos> We'll tell you.
It's kind of goth.<eos> I'd feel like I was marrying Marilyn Manson.<eos> What about these two, with the little diamonds?<eos> Oh, yeah, beautiful.<eos> How much? Too expensive for you.
No.<eos> What's this about?<eos> Can I come in for a moment?<eos> I'm afraid we've had a complaint from the manager of the car wash where Henry was employed.<eos> Tom phoned you?
Have a seat.<eos> Good morning, jurors.<eos> My name is Helen Weiss. I work for the District Attorney of New York.<eos> But my real employer, as I come before you today, is a young woman who lies in a grave at St. Raymond's Cemetery.<eos> It's my job for her to speak to you, to take you on a tour of her final, desperate hours.
My mother always said there was gonna be an event. That I was picked out. I was chosen.<eos> Well, here it is.<eos> Good morning. I think we're expected.<eos> Goodness me. Oh.<eos> Ah, yes, hello, delighted to see you.
No, not at 4:30 in the morning.<eos> They're very dedicated.<eos> Yeah, but what makes you think someone is here?<eos> I mean, if, in fact, you think someone is here.<eos> We don't mean to disorient you, all right? Just calm down.
So you're not alone.<eos> Our daughter doesn't count.<eos> She was a cesarean. She looks so familiar.<eos> Yes, to us too.<eos> She doesn't look like either of you.
Do you mean the "Deathstalker" scorpion, Dr. Sweet?<eos> Why, yes, Miss, I do.<eos> Those found in the Sudan, for example?<eos> Yes, precisely those.<eos> Now, can any of you tell me which are the most dangerous?
Yellow ones or little brown ones?<eos> Little red ones, actually.<eos> All right, all right. Not tonight, for Christ's sake.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - Constable Nixon will see you out.
- Hartford.<eos> Um, well, we're sure very lucky to have you here.<eos> My little boy's... he's all there is.<eos> Good evening, everybody. Welcome to our hearing.<eos> I'm Sheriff Tom Weineke, as most of you know.
We have a very special array of events for you today.<eos> Where we bring you the very latest in fashion, with the help of the world famous Dolly Sisters.<eos> And introducing a brand new department... Technology.<eos> Everything you could want for the house of the future.<eos> And if you turn on your wireless sets at 3pm, we have a real Selfridges treat for you.

- Get out of here.<eos> - Oh, my God, you guys!<eos> What?<eos> Madam Secretary, Professor McCord.<eos> So nice to finally see you again.
Anyways, I'll try to find some place...<eos> Here I was thinking, when that woman left she's taken all her troubles with her.<eos> Have you ever seen this car's owner around here?<eos> Well, it wasn't like, just a couple guys visiting her.<eos> I might have to trouble you again when the police comes... if they have any questions about exactly what you saw.
- We'll go, dad, just wait a little.<eos> Majid!<eos> If mother doesn't see him, she'd think something must've happened to him.<eos> Hello, sorry.<eos> We were in such a hurry that we didn't notice you.
Hi.<eos> Hi.<eos> I was early, got here first.<eos> Yeah. I see that.<eos> May I show you to your table?
Miles, stop.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> Ignore him.<eos> We're here to meet Jessica Moore. Is she expecting you?<eos> "Is she expecting you?" Who-who are you?
But I-I thought that we agreed that my-- my feet are off-limits.<eos> And through the sensate therapy, we hope to refocus your husband's desire on to more acceptable parts of your body, but if that refocusing leads to his hiding his desire, then that desire becomes something else.<eos> A secret.<eos> A secret in a marriage is very hard to survive.<eos> You have a better chance if you can find your pleasure together.
What are you doing here?<eos> I didn't expect to see you before the end of term.<eos> I have business to discuss with you, but it can wait.<eos> No need.<eos> With your permission, Lady Arabella, I will re-join you the day after tomorrow.
You order me to marry Mary, Mama?<eos> As I always would have, if only circumstances had been different, which they now so happily are.<eos> Quiet, Bell, you have got off lightly.<eos> Let us leave Mary and Frank to settle things between them.<eos> I'll see you out.
We told you not to take her on that mountain.<eos> Why are you always taking her on those damn mountains?<eos> Uh, is there a place, uh, where I can wait for her during surgery?<eos> We all want to wait.<eos> I'll take you all somewhere more private.
Only... he... he just started sitting up, but he hasn't been able to do that the last couple days.<eos> Let's order a CBC, CMP, UA, and blood cultures, and let's start a 10cc bolus of albumin and page Dr. Grant.<eos> What is all that?<eos> We just need to run some further tests, and I'm bringing in a specialist to consult.<eos> We're gonna find out what's going on with you.
She hates me, but Blake mostly doesn't.<eos> Professor Blake, Professor Donaldson<eos> _<eos> _<eos> I just want to assure you, I do not write college papers for money.
I'm actually not sure.<eos> What do you think about the catfish filet?<eos> Well, it's okay, but actually tonight, we have a special grilled scallop and lobster meal.<eos> It's incredible.<eos> You guys seem like you're having a special night. That meal would be perfect.
How does this help?<eos> People who like abstract paintings are open to new ideas.<eos> New stories.<eos> We just don't want to let the other side know what we're fishing for.<eos> How many of you prefer the fruit?
You can't take her.<eos> You'll kill her.<eos> Please, it's for her own good.<eos> Can we clear the hallway, please?<eos> Mr. and Mrs. Rance, I know this is a very difficult moment for you.
I am the consul's wife. - Yes.<eos> - Don't be so formal, dear.<eos> Ms. Bell, this is Judith.<eos> Welcome.<eos> I brought you a present. One for each of you.
The heart!<eos> The heart!<eos> Disruptive technology A B theeta beeta gaama<eos> Five hundred and seventy-five methods, fester.<eos> He's prepared a play for you
Even now, he's secretly their chief.<eos> Looking good!<eos> I apologize, but something has come up.<eos> Because of this, I can't perform tonight.<eos> I'll make it up to you later.
And now our future King will address all of you with a few words.<eos> I request His Majesty...<eos> Ladies...!<eos> Ladies and Gentlemen!<eos> As always, it's time to give a long speech in pure Hindi the length and breadth of which can bore you, put you to sleep, and make you run away.
No, no, Carrillo's solid.<eos> Did anyone have access to your credentials?<eos> Did you drop your wallet?<eos> Passport.<eos> How important is this cat to you? Excuse me?
And once that drove off, we did what we did.<eos> - For the kids.<eos> - The kids.<eos> I wouldn't know about any of that, I just...<eos> I can assure you that you and your family are safe.
So how do we get started?<eos> Do you need us to sign that little paper?<eos> I am... I am very sorry, but I'm afraid I can't take your case.<eos> My schedule is just... It's just chock-full right now.<eos> I highly encourage you to go back to HHM.
- The clothes, the shoes, the Caddy?<eos> - You're no collection agent.<eos> - I am. You think you're the first one that came looking for her?<eos> She's a tornado just leaving a trail of broken bodies behind her.<eos> I didn't mean to disturb you.
Were I to succeed, I should have to proceed with the greatest caution.<eos> Besides, their knowledge and power are such that a magician cannot lightly dispense with their help.<eos> Not unless that magician is Gilbert Norrell.<eos> What a very interesting topic.<eos> What brings you to Venice?
And I-I wanted you close because I really loved you.<eos> I-I'm sorry.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> These are Alec's parents, Judith and Arthur.<eos> Well, nice to meet you.
Shawn's a good kid.<eos> He's not gonna survive another ride on your merry-go-round.<eos> And if you're gonna stick it out with Ghost, then that's great.<eos> But you better be 100% sure that you're choosing the right man.<eos> Yes, hi. My husband and I stayed with you a few nights ago and I think I left a nightgown in our room.
He's diabetic.<eos> He forgot his insulin today, and if we don't get on that flight, he may die.<eos> Oh, my goodness.<eos> Of course.<eos> I'll get one of our flight attendants to escort you on.
It's okay.<eos> Uh, I've got you listed.<eos> Mr. and Mrs. Davidson.<eos> Uh, let's just do this.<eos> I'll scan the main barcode and let you in.
Because we're all being watched by an intelligent supercomputer that's slowly but surely taking over the world.<eos> You can return to your seat in the gallery, Mr. Whistler.<eos> That's Professor Whistler, actually.<eos> Okay, that's our jury.<eos> The rest of you are free to go.
No, it's too early-- we don't know where this is going yet.<eos> I'm not saying she has to come out pro-cop or anti-cop...<eos> Guys, guys.<eos> Okay, thanks.<eos> Good evening, and welcome to the debate for Cook County State's Attorney, coming to you from the ballroom of the Bonaventure Hotel.
I promise, honey.<eos> I'm giving you some medicine to help you relax.<eos> - Dad?<eos> - It's gonna be okay.<eos> - I'll come see you right after.
There's been a mistake.<eos> I met Missy Brammer two days ago in San Antonio.<eos> Well, that's impossible, because Miss Brammer's been here in D.C. all week preparing for the hearings.<eos> Uh, which I'm gonna be late for if I don't hurry. Okay.<eos> Nice to meet you all.
You called it.<eos> Plan B.<eos> Our students' achievements are undeniable.<eos> And your children's achievements will also be undeniable.<eos> I invite you tonight to our annual gala to meet our parents and faculty.
"Do I feel lucky?"<eos> Well, do ya, punk?<eos> Oh, Mr. Harry, you're really not gonna like what I have to say.<eos> Hi.<eos> What can I do for you?
- Okay, Tommy Gobbler.<eos> - There you go!<eos> These are the Davidsons.<eos> They want to know what happened to their missing grandmother.<eos> I have some deeply tragic news for you.
Hang on a second.<eos> That's that yellow building right there.<eos> So this is from... one of those windows up there.<eos> Donaldson did say he was hiding in a place of God.<eos> May I help you?
Miss?<eos> - Will Dr Clarkson be moving to York?<eos> - No need to worry.<eos> He's going to stay right here and look after you.<eos> What I need to reassure you about is that nothing really is going to change on a day-to-day basis.
There'd be no shortage of new leads.<eos> You were gonna let him do it, weren't you?<eos> Maria's brother... you were gonna let him hit you with that wrench.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> The councilman will see you now.
That said, we're here to warn you that your foundation may be the target of the hacker collective Everyone.<eos> You might want to get your cyber house in order.<eos> We would hate for your carefully concealed donor lists to become public knowledge.<eos> Thank you for your concern.<eos> I'll walk you out.
I'd love to, but we're full.<eos> But good news... your two tea sets are ready to be picked up at the gift shop.<eos> Two?<eos> Jim.<eos> I can put you on our waiting list.
We'll let you all through in five minutes.<eos> Please pull over to the waiting area.<eos> Excuse-- excuse me, sir.<eos> My wife has an appointment. We need to--<eos> We'll let you go as soon as we can, sir.
This? A ruler?<eos> Yes. That's it.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I wanted to thank you all for coming.<eos> I realize this is an extremely difficult time for all of you.
Thank you.<eos> Ms Westfall, your statement please?<eos> I have worked in Corrections for nearly twenty years now, so I am no new hand here.<eos> But I have never treated a client with such potential as Franky Doyle.<eos> You know, she has been utterly honest with you here today. Maybe too honest. But she has faced up to herself, and acknowledged that no-one has complete control.
I understand you've been looking for me.<eos> Yeah, I'm detective Beckett. This is Richard Castle.<eos> We need to speak with you regarding one of your patients... Noah Lewis.<eos> Of course.<eos> Let me just finish with these prescriptions, and I'll be right with you.
I just need to notate it in my ledger.<eos> So, dropping your only daughter off at college?<eos> Don't say it.<eos> Don't say it.<eos> Must be a pretty emotional time for you.
I worked on it with Mona.<eos> You're gonna sell 'em on the numbers, and I'm giving you the personal touch.<eos> Teamwork.<eos> At this time, we ask all passengers to turn off personal electronic devices and stow them for takeoff.<eos> We will notify you when it is safe to use them again.
We should have a longer conversation about that, Frank.<eos> I really value your opinion.<eos> Thank you for coming. Hope?<eos> Thank you very much, everybody.<eos> I will escort you out now.
Mikhail, what a surprise.<eos> Thank you for seeing me.<eos> Of course.<eos> Uh, this is Nadine Tolliver, my chief of staff, and Jay Whitman, my chief policy advisor.<eos> Pleasure to meet you both.
We do not know them, we cannot trust them.<eos> They make us vulnerable.<eos> Let us show them a little Christian charity.<eos> We oblige to you for your kindness and your generosity.<eos> We are happy to welcome you for the moment.
Where is she?<eos> It was a difficult surgery, but it went well.<eos> Dr. Abrams was able to relieve the pressure on Gina's brain.<eos> Both Gina and the baby came through just fine, so far.<eos> Dr. Abrams will be out to speak to you shortly.
Make my check out to Walter O'Brien for Megan.<eos> Yeah, ditto.<eos> Same here.<eos> I'll take care of it.<eos> I look forward to hearing from you.
Grabbed the occasional beer, talked about girls, sports.<eos> You guys ever talk about family?<eos> It's hard to say, but when you're Gordon Fontaine's son, it's not exactly easy to keep a low profile.<eos> Our family goes back five generations in this city.<eos> We're gonna need elimination prints from you and anyone else who might've come in contact with the furniture.
It's always been a dream of mine.<eos> Well, it is lovely to meet another member of the family.<eos> Where was Gerald and Jimmy's first date?<eos> Gr-Griffith Park.<eos> It was so nice to meet you. I... What?
We believe that Peter Bradshaw was targeted by an organised group and the public, at large, is not at risk.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Sorry, I said no questions.<eos> As yet, no group has claimed responsibility.<eos> They might go straight to you guys.
- No, no. No, I don't... - It's okay.<eos> I'm Bec... Cartwell.<eos> I'm here for the job interview.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So... which one of you plays piano? - I do. Did.
The gang's all here.<eos> Of all the gin joints...<eos> Delta, you look even younger now than you did that time in Piccadilly when you played with those children.<eos> That was fun, wasn't it?<eos> It was really nice to see you all, but I gotta go. -Feel better.
-What do you say?<eos> -Oh, my stairwell days are over.<eos> You had stairwell days?<eos> Maggie Stuart?<eos> I'm about to finish my MBA at Columbia Business School so I come to you with wonderful references from Professor Wilson and I've been offered a futures job at E.F. Hutton in New York but Howard and Company is where I want to be.
All of Europe has turned their back on him.<eos> - Thank you so much. - Your Highness...<eos> Au revoir. Turned their back on Rainier...<eos> Not Grace.<eos> The Princess needs to see you.
What an amazing beast!<eos> Remarkable.<eos> It's time for the awards.<eos> Well, I won't keep you from the ceremony.<eos> Pleasure seeing you both.
- Good evening.<eos> - Hello.<eos> Have you been here before?<eos> No.<eos> Oh, may I suggest for you the tasting menu?
Anyone know what to do about a bird?<eos> 3500.<eos> I'm giving you the better option.<eos> I'm gonna have to send these guys who are being employed today to get your stuff and throw it on the kerb.<eos> - I don't want to take you to jail.
Maybe, but if you present a piece like that to a jury there has to be something wrong with you.<eos> Gabriel Pasternak!<eos> How could I forget him?<eos> We laughed about it for months.<eos> I´m sorry to interrupt, but I was listening to you.
Good.<eos> Catherine, what...<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Keith...<eos> Mr. and Mrs. Despont, may I show you to your table?
Yes, I'm agent Lisbon.<eos> This is Patrick Jane.<eos> Come in.<eos> This is my wife, Mae.<eos> Nice to meet you.
Your corporate structure is incredibly convoluted.<eos> It's almost like you didn't want the truck linked back to your company.<eos> Not at all.<eos> It's simply done that way for tax purposes.<eos> I wouldn't want to bore you with the details.
That extra card...<eos> Where'd you hide it?<eos> I ate it.<eos> Here.<eos> - It's for you.
That's unbelievable.<eos> What do you think of that, sweetheart?<eos> - It's awesome.<eos> - It's glorious.<eos> And now I present to you the grand finale.
No, he's not!<eos> On the contrary.<eos> That is so... Big Brother.<eos> Greetings, Detective Beckett, Mr. Castle.<eos> What can I do for you?
Immortality.<eos> Let's turn to "Update America" for the latest.<eos> Coming up next, a live exclusive from Carrie Cooke.<eos> Here we go, here we go!<eos> Tonight, I bring you an exclusive.
It is a 15th-century shuriken.<eos> Very rare.<eos> Mr. Saito, I'm Detective Beckett.<eos> This is Detective Esposito.<eos> What can I do for you?
- Mom! So, did you speak to our doctor? I did.<eos> He said Braden has S.C.I.D.<eos> - Bubble boy disease. - Braden.<eos> He knows that we hate it when he calls it that.<eos> And he sent you here?
I'll explain, uh...<eos> Meet me in the hotel bar.<eos> Afternoon. NCIS.<eos> Special Agents Gibbs and Bishop.<eos> Uh, yes, the senator is expecting you.
New window.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hi. We're here about the break-in.<eos> Well, I'm afraid you've been misinformed.
The FBI already has an excellent team in Berlin, so the challenge isn't a procedural one.<eos> Please be more specific. What exactly is the challenge, Agent Booth?<eos> We need to get a better understanding of potential terrorists that might target American interests.<eos> I've laid out a 15-point plan that addresses that.<eos> Each of you got a copy of that yesterday.
The sooner we operate, the sooner he goes home.<eos> - Sound good to you?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> We just need to transfer you onto my service.<eos> Dr. Ross will pick up the paperwork for you.
_<eos> No.<eos> All done now.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> I have some news for you.
New York Pest Control Services.<eos> We have to inspect your executive dining facilities.<eos> I don't have you down here. Well they don't let us make appointments<eos> -for inspections, you know?<eos> -I can't let you through -without an ok from security. -You're sure about that?
I's diet Coke.<eos> Two diet Cokes, no problem.<eos> Two straws.<eos> Sure.<eos> The menu, there for you.
I have to go tell the Pavel family why we haven't solved their daughter's murder yet.<eos> We really appreciate you stopping by, Agent Moretti.<eos> Yeah. These last couple of weeks, you know, not hearing anything, it's...<eos> it's... it's been hell.<eos> Well, let me assure you this is very much an active investigation.
I'll compare these samples to the body at the morgue.<eos> But the man I brought in earlier is, uh, refusing to submit to the tests.<eos> Can't you make him?<eos> I can't force a man to inherit money he doesn't want.<eos> A Mr. tavish is here to see you.
Might I take up a moment of your time?<eos> I had a call earlier from Sergeant Willis.<eos> Mr Vyner is back up here and wants to come by in the morning.<eos> To see me.<eos> To see both of you.
Sometimes you don't.<eos> No.<eos> All done now.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> I have some news for you.
Yes, she's a very beautiful woman.<eos> And would I have preferred it if he had not gone off to shoot that silly little art film in Budapest?<eos> Sure.<eos> But Fletch wasn't cheating on me.<eos> I can assure you.
It is with great sadness I sacrifice myself at a point marking.<eos> A selection I have chosen to add holet where humiliations against my person started.<eos> Can you please to move a little further away?<eos> I plan to make a political point mark.<eos> Is there one of you whose number... 32?
- You sure you can handle this thing?<eos> There can't be much to it.<eos> Aw... that's my car.<eos> I'm afraid the elevator is currently closed to guests, sir.<eos> I could take you to the service elevator if...
Well, cameras are installed.<eos> You never told me the code for that thing, anyway.<eos> It's our anniversary.<eos> Dad!<eos> Nice to meet you.
Hi. I'm Dr. Alison Ellesmere, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist.<eos> I'm Leonard Vance's responsible clinician.<eos> First meetings, you lead.<eos> I'm Ruth Hattersley from Missing Persons Bureau, and this is DS Sean Stone.<eos> Nice to meet you both.
And Nygma..., let me know when they're set up for the autopsy, all right?<eos> Anything in particular you want me to look out for? Just call me.<eos> You see, the strange thing, the horrible thing... is that I've been having the same dream for weeks.<eos> Of a dark, overbearing presence.<eos> Mr. Hastings, about your daughter, and we know that this is difficult, but... did she have anyone in her life that worried you?
But we're actually most concerned about the situation with your son.<eos> We'd like to know what you're gonna do about that.<eos> Well, actually, he would like to apologize to Dylan.<eos> Only if she wants to meet me out of her own free will.<eos> If not, then I can just apologize to the two of you.
That crazy bitch just fucked up my best friend's debut.<eos> Would you go to dinner with me?<eos> What? Ay, wey. Ana Maria, she's right.<eos> But she's not right about you being bourgeois pigs.<eos> Although the vast majority of you are bourgeois elite.
Wee-San.<eos> If you guys will just be patient for a few more moments.<eos> Agent Pride, this is Marshall and Liza Chase.<eos> Jacket you found in that apartment was issued to their son Zack.<eos> Nice to meet you folks.
- Perhaps at the craps table.<eos> - I'd rather not be the polo player.<eos> Tom.<eos> You should be proud of your achievements.<eos> May I show you around?
Yes. The names of... Stephen Dedalus and Daisy Buchanan.<eos> Chet Atkins... Dates of birth...?<eos> You need something?<eos> Mosieur? Madame?<eos> J'ai quelque chose spécial por vous I have something very special for you.
Where are we?<eos> - Did you find Marlowe?<eos> - No, we gotta go find him. You gotta get up, come on<eos> Fuck, can't even fucking walk.<eos> I've got something very special for you I have what you need
- Please. Thank you.<eos> I was worried about you.<eos> Where did you go?<eos> Just all over.<eos> Well, it's good to see you both.
If that's... uh, okay with you, please come in.<eos> Then they shall exchange the marriage vows.<eos> You look beautiful.<eos> Mr. and Mrs. Kurokawa. No words can express our gratitude for your kindness.<eos> We will never forget our debt to you.
Dozens of patients have turned up complaining of dizziness and dehydration due to excessive sweating.<eos> It's all being chalked up to the unseasonably hot, humid weather that's gripped western Europe this past week.<eos> Officials are asking people to stay indoors and drink plenty of water till the heat wave passes.<eos> When we come back, why is this secretary of state taking salsa lessons?<eos> The answer might surprise you.
So then, close your eyes.<eos> Both of you.<eos> Now take a deep breath, and just listen to the ticking.<eos> Now feel yourselves getting sleepier and sleepier, and let the darkness drift further and further away.<eos> - Who is it? - I have a message for you.
No, no, no, you don't do that.<eos> That's not how decent people behave, is it?<eos> How is society supposed to function with people like you dragging us into a cesspit? Mmm?<eos> We're not animals!<eos> - Sorry, we just didn't see you.
I bid on projects.<eos> If I'm lucky, I-I get them, I win.<eos> Which means someone else loses.<eos> Right.<eos> Look, I understand how confusing and difficult this must be for both of you.
You say we should solve this, but is there a textbook for this?<eos> Well put.<eos> I don't know if I like the suggestion<eos> But it could turn out all right.<eos> You have the same blood, and that's what counts.
Who stays with Jackie?<eos> Jackie isn't chief executive.<eos> Nor is she related to one... anymore.<eos> I'm not going anywhere without her.<eos> Let us recall for you now what has transpired.
Oh uh, what's going on with my funds?<eos> Uh...<eos> Jim, look I really gotta...<eos> I'm in a...<eos> I'll talk to you in a couple days...
Robert Riley was and is guilty, end of story.<eos> Is there any reason you wouldn't want her exhumed?<eos> You are way out of line.<eos> Dr. Murphy, I don't know what game your office is playing here, but it needs to end, right now.<eos> My sincere apologies, to both of you.
Come on.<eos> Come.<eos> - I'll get it.<eos> This is the chair that I had in Isabel's nursery.<eos> I'm very happy for you.
Thank you, sir. Oh.<eos> Much appreciated. It's my pleas--<eos> Um, alth--I-I was just heading--<eos> I'll leave you to it.<eos> I have something for you.
Charlie was trying to get it back for you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I want you to know that your daughter changed.<eos> She knew that she hurt you both, and she wanted to make it right.<eos> She loved you.
I think there's something wrong with her.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Babies don't typically laugh Until they're at least four months old, And they definitely don't laugh like that.<eos> Wait! Hold on!<eos> I didn't mean to offend you.
They've agreed to take her as soon as she comes home.<eos> She's here... isn't she?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Your daughter, her body was found this morning.<eos> I'm gonna need you to come down to the coroner's office...
How popular was Frankenstein?<eos> Probably one of the more famous of all the monsters.<eos> Frankenstein's kind of cute when he's a girl.<eos> Have you suffered health problems following the consumption of unusual types of milk?<eos> Reckless public service announcements may have directed you to drink unregulated soy, goat, or hemp milk.
He walked out in front of a lorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Do you miss him?<eos> Of course I miss him.<eos> Actually, I have something you might be interested in.
We don't believe that was her intention.<eos> You don't believe?<eos> That's reassuring.<eos> Can you tell me what she did want?<eos> It appears she was planning to abduct one of you.
Oh, god.<eos> It's like...<eos> Hello, I'm Dr. Mattoo.<eos> You can call me Kan if you'd like.<eos> You wouldn't be here if you weren't experiencing some pain or discomfort.
You thought you saw a young girl enter the yard.<eos> You imagine you heard music or her voice?<eos> You believe she might be in there? Not very substantial, is it?<eos> But why won't you help us?<eos> I'm not hindering you.
Right...<eos> I've got to tell the others now.<eos> Time and tide wait for no man, eh? Time and space, Bill.<eos> And they wait for no woman either.<eos> I'm not hindering you.
However, his ritual never changes.<eos> Oh, I am so sorry. It's ok.<eos> It's likely that there are other women he's already targeted, so be vigilant if there are any reports of suspicious behavior. Thank you.<eos> TV:<eos> This is Alicia Danner reporting live to you from outside the 13th Street apartment building, where the body of a local college student has just been identified as Kayla Jefferson.
We did.<eos> Mrs. Henderson, the landlord, she told us what to do with our offer. Charming woman.<eos> You took advantage of her.<eos> Our actions are well within the law,<eos> I assure you.
The name's Foyle.<eos> This is erm...<eos> Samantha Wainwright.<eos> Hello.<eos> What can I do for you?
I feel so badly... about what happened the other night.<eos> I had no idea Mr. Stappord would attack your husband.<eos> Is that all?<eos> I also... wanted to tell you that I've grown fond of you and Mr. Powell.<eos> And if you could find it in your heart to forgive me, I would love to come back and work for you.
Do you have contact info for him?<eos> Home address?<eos> - Phone?<eos> - Sure.<eos> Let me dig it out for you.
Um... my partner is in the conference room, if you'll come this way.<eos> (Patrick) You make drones here?<eos> (Kris) Uh, we design them.<eos> We don't manufacture.<eos> (Cho) What did Titus Stone do for you?
What are you talking about?<eos> Hiring someone outside Visualize might have made you feel safe, but she admitted that you hired her.<eos> Agent Cho told me.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> But all I can say is that if someone did bug you, it wasn't me.
The likes of which you've never seen before, Arthur.<eos> I think he means clean trousers, Arthur.<eos> Sorry, Mr Weston, Mrs Weston, we're closed.<eos> Under Mr Moray's instructions.<eos> But of course, we're open for you, sir.
Uh, $37.<eos> 37.28, yeah.<eos> $85 a month between you.<eos> 85.28.<eos> As I hope your respective counsels advised you, in cases such as these, the law presumes it is in the child's best interest to remain in the custody of blood relatives.
Your table is ready, Mr. Baxter. Great.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I will handle this motley crew, Lindsey.<eos> And tell Arturo we have a party of 12 coming in.<eos> Let me show you to your table.
Thanks.<eos> I will handle this motley crew, Lindsey.<eos> And tell Arturo we have a party of 12 coming in.<eos> Let me show you to your table.<eos> "Let me show you to your table." Fancy.
Now, by all means.<eos> Vernon. Well, as long as you're done.<eos> Hi, checking in.<eos> Mike Henry.<eos> Great, we've got you in a garden view suite.
Now, if you will, please sing the national anthem of the United States.<eos> O say can you see By the dawn's early light<eos> What so proudly we hailed At the twilight's last gleaming<eos> Oh-I-ee-I... Okay, I've reviewed your application.<eos> Now, where you listed employment, some of you wrote "Family Guy," and others wrote "The Family Guy."
The baby hasn't actually said a word.<eos> Why not?<eos> Because he's a baby.<eos> They've been alone here over three long months.<eos> I need to warn both of you that this is not going to be easy.
That is style.<eos> Help is on the way.<eos> Aren't you...<eos> That's right. It's me.<eos> We are now sending you live to the street where Tom has more.
Say what you will, but the Duchess did have style.<eos> She brought in an decorator, feng shui the whole place, she even hired a gay butler.<eos> This guy was smart, sophisticated, professional, I mean really, really great.<eos> - Jasmine?<eos> - Yes, Sir, I try to stump you this evening, really good.
I tried many times to call you but to no avail.<eos> I only pick up the phone when I've stored the caller's number and I know who's calling.<eos> But come on in.<eos> I was so sorry that I couldn't manage to come by after the concert.<eos> I was so pleased that you came.
Geoff doesn't need to come. It's not necessary.<eos> I don't need any comments on my predicament.<eos> I can only take his British humor in small doses.<eos> Dear Mrs. Laurent and Mr. Laurent.<eos> It was beautiful and yet sad to see you.
Probably not.<eos> You really ran the gamut of indecisiveness on that one, - you know that, right?<eos> - Yeah, I kind of did, didn't I?<eos> Josh cut off his penis because something came out of my vagina.<eos> He should be coming to shortly, so the nurse is gonna take you guys back there.
You're no longer at Cargo Lagarde.<eos> Why did you go and become a cook in Nevers?<eos> Neat place, Nevers!<eos> Here we have some neat images of you cooking in your new restaurant.<eos> For you.
Is the real reason we're staying 'cause that guy's dead?<eos> The one you arrested.<eos> In breaking news tonight, a lone gunman opened fire outside the city jail while police were transporting Councilman Darren Richmond.<eos> Eyewitnesses have described the shooter as a while male, but other details remain unclear.<eos> As information continues to pour in on this story, we will keep you informed.
I hope you do not come to regret your decision.<eos> His last recovery effort resulted in the deaths of four girls.<eos> Two the same age as Becky.<eos> Two younger.<eos> Although we may not be moving as quickly as you imagine we should,
Bye'<eos> Hello?<eos> Look, I'm qualified. I'm more than qualified for this job.<eos> I have wasted the last five years of my life working for the wrong company.<eos> I'm ready to lake my career to the next level which is why I'm here with you.
Keep still, sweetie.<eos> Don't cry.<eos> All done. All done.<eos> Don't do that. It's all done now.<eos> Right. The doctor will see you now.
You are sure she said it was her cat?<eos> Well, if that is all...<eos> I'm not, it's been a while.<eos> But I'm sure Emilie has a good explanation.<eos> - I'll see you out.
Let's go home.<eos> Tungee, we're so sorry.<eos> You must have been so scared.<eos> Yeah, we're never going to leave you again, ever.<eos> And I never want to leave you, the most generous, wonderful people I have ever...
- Not going to lunch.<eos> - I don't even have my coat.<eos> Look at your watch. Man:<eos> Well, hello.<eos> What brings you in today?
There's nothing we can tell you.<eos> Tragic as it is.<eos> We just want to get on with our lives.<eos> And we will continue our investigation into the murder of your daughter.<eos> I'll see you out.
Well, for the record, a CD was not sent to the police this morning, and the "Tragic Overture" was written by Brahms, not Wagner, so luckily, I guess it's not your cousin.<eos> The FBI would greatly appreciate it if people would stop making false claims to get their 15 minutes of fame.<eos> Thank you. Thank you very much.<eos> Well, this is quite a surprise development we just witnessed outside the San Francisco FBI building.<eos> We'll have more for you later.
Looks too comfortable.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> We were told you had a message.<eos> No, that was a lie.<eos> I just wanted to get you all together.
You can put the drinks down.<eos> -These are not for you...
Are you on such formal terms?<eos> Do all doctors act like that?<eos> Only sometimes.<eos> Barbara, I'm coming.<eos> This is for you both.
It's in Rome.<eos> I don't need you to protect me anymore, mom.<eos> I'll always protect you, Michael.<eos> Bonsoir, monsieur Hayden.<eos> Madame. We have something very private for you in the corner.
Jessica Donner is not a doctor.<eos> She was effectively treating this young person, prescribing medication.<eos> The defendant is hardly educated enough to counsel or to diagnose... she's not in any position to understand the intricacies of drug interaction.<eos> She's been poisoning these young girls with a high dose of hormones.<eos> I suppose some of you are parents.
That's all?<eos> That's all.<eos> Of course, that's not all.<eos> What's left is ma mystère.<eos> Would those of you who have purchased a special pass, please join us in the vault anteroom.
Can we get some cotton candy?<eos> Gentlemen, Mrs. Thompson, thank you for a terrific year.<eos> - Always a pleasure.<eos> - Happy New Year.<eos> - And to you as well. - We'll see you tonight, then?
He wouldn't.<eos> And I don't believe he did.<eos> As much as he loved serving his country, he was glad when his last tour was over.<eos> He liked being a Marine, but he was eager to start the next chapter of his life.<eos> Now, I know this must be difficult for you,
So...what happens now?<eos> Well, it's an indie, but we're expecting it to do well on the festival circuit, so...<eos> No.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Well, I really wish that we could do something for you, but we just don't give loans to high risk investments.
You think she did this?<eos> No.<eos> My daughter is dead, Detective!<eos> I know, and I don't think she did anything wrong.<eos> I just need to get as much information as I can from you so I can find who did this, OK?
- Don't worry about it. We're good.<eos> Thom.<eos> I'm Lieutenant Burns.<eos> I'm running a murder investigation, and you're not cooperating.<eos> What can I do for you?
Today is not about you two.<eos> Today is about Howard and Bernadette and me.<eos> Folks, can I have your attention.<eos> It's 5:00, we're going to be able to take three more couples.<eos> The rest of you will have to come back on Monday.
You already did.<eos> I had that coming.<eos> Again, pleasure, Mr. Prime Minister.<eos> Thank you, Commissioner.<eos> Detective Baker will show you out.
Nurse, who's the worst doctor in this hospital?<eos> You are, Dr. Hartman.<eos> Good.<eos> Put Hartman on this bozo.<eos> Hey, what can I do for you?
Dogs and humans protect the Alpha.<eos> Don't worry, Rawson.<eos> It's fine. Come on.<eos> This is my son Kyle.<eos> Very nice to meet you, ma'am. Sir.
It's 'stoffer.<eos> Ah, that sounds good.<eos> Keep going.<eos> I know it's a difficult time so I'll be brief.<eos> I would just like to assure you that the government, and myself, are doing all that we can to return your daughter to you.
The yacht came from a kickback on the fraudulent tax returns. I'll get back to you.<eos> We're not taking a plea bargain.<eos> On that we agree, Bucky.<eos> Drop these charges, or we will present them in court.<eos> You'll lose, and expose some embarrassing interagency confusion. Like I said, I'll get back to you.
I'm calling on behalf Zealand.<eos> I'm the secretary of Niels Reinhardt.<eos> I want a room for his books, but I forget what he always did.<eos> That we know. Mr. Reinhardt always 312, overlooking the sea.<eos> Which dates are you?

I tried your pee water thingy.<eos> It kind of works.<eos> Smart purchase.<eos> Oh, hi, Mr. and Mrs. Gutierrez.<eos> This is not to you.
- You're not upset?<eos> She's lovely, but I trust you.<eos> Your mother, on the other hand...<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the happy couple.<eos> In the unlikely event of an emergency landing, the cabin crew will direct you to the nearest available exit.
I checked all our databases.<eos> We have no record of Mr. Kent or Mr. Queen in our facility.<eos> - Did you try the Justice Department?<eos> - Yes, I tried.<eos> Not to mention the Department of Domestic Security the State Department, and the Defense Department that referred me back to you.
Lemon, meet me in my office in ten.<eos> I need to ask you something.<eos> Oh, do you need sex advice?<eos> Here's a tip. Sometimes a lady likes to leave her blazer on.<eos> Sir, ma'am, this is for you... a gift bag.
Working a cover at a foreign resort isn't about keeping a low profile -- it's about having as much access as possible.<eos> Arrive in a nice car and tip extravagantly, and the service staff will open all sorts of doors for you.<eos> If you want to rub elbows with the other guests, select a cover that gives you an excuse to be social and a reason for the hotel to upgrade you to a central room.<eos> "Travel writer" usually works fine.<eos> We have a lovely suite for you.
Is Wayne all right?<eos> You're scaring me.<eos> Dr. Lightman and Dr. Foster are doing everything they can.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I should warn you--one of the symptoms of Wayne's schizoaffective disorder is that often he doesn't speak at all to people he doesn't trust.
Unbelievable.<eos> Smooth, Megan, very smooth.<eos> I'm right, he's wrong.<eos> The question is, how to prove it?<eos> I know this is very difficult for you, but when was the last time you spoke with Angela?
Don't go.<eos> Please don't go.<eos> Please don't go away from me.<eos> Well, according to live witnesses regarding the recent events currently taking place in Montgomery County, where an explosion has happened.<eos> We're trying our best to bring you new information, but we really don't know what is going on.
- Hey, sir and madam. May I please see your tickets real quick?<eos> Let's check 'em out, make sure these babies are legit.<eos> You guys are bronze package.<eos> Problem? Um, minor.<eos> I can bump you guys up to platinum package.
And I'm sick of it, that you always happened to be there, where am I going to show up.<eos> At first I liked the Attention.<eos> It was nice.<eos> But now it's too much, I can no longer live.<eos> You want to have someone which is always there for you.
I've put a new length of pipe in so it should be working for you.<eos> There you go.<eos> May the Lord smite thee down.<eos> It's 3pm and the Woods family are checking in for their annual summer holiday, but there's a hiccup.<eos> I have actually got you booked in on this flight, but not until next Monday. Eh?
Just... make sure you're careful.<eos> It can be dangerous out here.<eos> Nice car.<eos> At 4:00 this afternoon, detectives from the New York City Intelligence Division took into custody four Pakistani nationals for allegedly plotting a bioterrorism attack against New York City's water supply system.<eos> I would like to introduce Deputy Commissioner Soren, head of NYPD Intelligence, to brief you on the details of this operation.
Rosie wanted, uh...<eos> She wanted the world, you know?<eos> Mr. Larsen?<eos> The front door was open.<eos> I hate to disturb you, but I need to check Rosie's room again to make sure we didn't miss anything.
Our school crest... a symbol of our history.<eos> Founded in 1918,<eos> The Archford Academy has always been a beacon for academic integrity.<eos> The key to our abiding success as a college preparatory school, which has produced numerous Ivy League graduates, begins in the classroom.<eos> And for those of you concerned with Archford's demanding workload, know that our teaching staff is always available, whatever the need may be.
If it's meant to be...<eos> Move along, c'mon.<eos> Calm now, guys!<eos> Move over this way, my friend.<eos> The doctor will fill you in.
I myself can replace her if you want it.<eos> You're grief will ease and after a while... will disappear completely.<eos> A couple of two-hours visits a week are enough.<eos> The end can be a new, better start.<eos> It's up to you.
Uh, mom, dad, Um, this is charlotte, and this is her mother, Augusta king.<eos> It's a pleasure.<eos> Hello.<eos> Hello.<eos> Nice to meet you.
Thank you so much.<eos> Ah. Your honor, I'd like the opportunity to call a character witness to testify that my client truly has changed.<eos> We're done, counselor.<eos> I think I've heard enough.<eos> And if either one of you want to appeal my decision, my brother, who just walked in... he's right behind you... will hear your case.
We'll have to work on that.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Are you the branch manager?<eos> Yes.<eos> I'll be with you in just one moment.
Next, Mr. Kent's going to tell us that, since there was no consent, there was no contract.<eos> As a matter of fact...<eos> The relevant case is Time v. Conroy... when parties possess a level of expertise in relevant areas, consent is implied.<eos> I've heard enough.<eos> I'll let you know when I've made my decision.
Miss? Um, excuse me.<eos> Can you help me?<eos> Have you seen my glasses? I think I left them in my coat. (Rumbles)<eos> (Tones chime) Yes, I'll take a look.<eos> (Dean) Ladies and gentlemen, we're hitting a patch of rough air, so for your safety, I'm gonna ask you to please return to your seat. (Panting) I've got it.
Have you got a Ouija board handy?<eos> She's dead?<eos> - And who would you be?<eos> - I'm the woman who bought her house.<eos> What's it to you?
Kept running away from the homes we placed her in.<eos> Ended up finishing her time in a group home.<eos> Well, can we get that number?<eos> Maybe there are friends we can talk to.<eos> I'll, uh, see what I can do and get back to you.
Entrap employers?<eos> That said, I understand the stress you two are under.<eos> Money, the baby, what happened here the other night.<eos> I don't mean to listen, but the walls here are paper thin.<eos> This unfortunate incident aside, I am happy to work for the two of you.
Well, I mean we hope to return when things improve.<eos> It's okay.<eos> We're not sure we'll be here.<eos> We lost our funding.<eos> You... what, your state funding? Yeah.
What I meant, Your Honor...<eos> Yes, it's all right.<eos> I know what you meant.<eos> I just think that it would be unjust to summarily dismiss this case before offering "a listening ear."<eos> And so, your motion is denied, Ms. Lockhart-- and the other two with you.

If that'll help.<eos> That'd be a big help.<eos> Would it be all right if I swing by your house and pick it up?<eos> Of course.<eos> Let me take you to go see your daughter.
I think probably...<eos> I would prefer to be out in the sunshine. But I am grateful for the amount of the tension that you've been giving to my book.<eos> And frankly I would have appreciated such a warm welcome back in England.<eos> But having my work acknowledged by the compatriots of Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci... is really something of a compliment, and I am very grateful for it.<eos> Some of you may know that the original idea for my book came to me when I was in Florence... in the Piazza della Signoria.
Even with your history with Dr. Kevorkian?<eos> What I've always said is I support The individual's right to choose.<eos> But I repeat- I will not be supporting doctor-assisted suicide.<eos> There you have it, folks.<eos> Now back to you, john.
Well, we don't want to involve the police.<eos> No, that's really a last resort.<eos> Will you let us know if he comes back?<eos> We will be in touch.<eos> I'll see you out.
I'm not gonna die without getting engaged!<eos> This is your captain here again, ladies and gentlemen.<eos> I may have underestimated the storm just a little bit, but I'm afraid we are being diverted to Cardiff, Wales, as Dublin Airport has been shut down.<eos> What?<eos> Once landed, ground staff will be happy to book you onto connecting flights in order to get you to your final destination.
Honey, at least you have the courage to feel.<eos> You feel everything so deeply.<eos> You're your father's daughter.<eos> Thank you all for coming.<eos> A lot of you have known my dad since he was a kid.
I like to drop by the empties in the district.<eos> You can't be too careful these days.<eos> Well, squatters, eco-warriors, unruly youth.<eos> In a world where there's no law and order any more, you know, a man can't sleep in his bed.<eos> Well, it is my pleasure to welcome you both to the parish and to wish you all the luck for the future.
I'm here because some of your forms have been filled in incorrectly.<eos> And I'm rather concerned that you may have deliberately filled them in inaccurately.<eos> Aye, I lied on them.<eos> What of it?<eos> In that case, I shall have no choice but to remove you from the property.
Hello, Mr. President.<eos> I haven't had the chance to thank you for compromising on the verification issue.<eos> It was the right thing to do.<eos> If you don't mind, I'd like to brief you both on the format of the press conference.<eos> The Secretary-General will be introducing you both after some brief remarks.
Why? You already got what you wanted.<eos> You killed everyone involved.<eos> Save your breath.<eos> I know about President Suvarov.<eos> Your delegations will be joining you at the reception after the post-signing ceremony.
-Yes?<eos> How come you never look me in the eye?<eos> Because I do not care to be hypnotized which is apparently what you walking dead people like to do.<eos> Hi there. Welcome to Merlotte's.<eos> I have a very romantic red vinyl booth for the two of you right over there.
It's been so rewarding spending time with my little angel.<eos> It breaks my heart to see it end.<eos> Anyway, here's her lunch, it's all packed, and we'll pick her up at 4:00.<eos> Wait just a second.<eos> There are a few other families on the waiting list before you.
Whoo, baby! Come on, baby.<eos> Oh, god!<eos> Unnatural!<eos> Guys, hide your eyes!<eos> Mr. Heck, Mrs. Heck, great to see you both.
You like sausage!<eos> Yeah.<eos> So?<eos> What the hell's so funny?<eos> I've been looking everywhere for you two gabones, and this is where I find you?
They're about to announce the results of the test.<eos> We're about to move on keller.<eos> Sounds like "checkmate" to me.<eos> Thank you again for your patience.<eos> We apologize for the delay, but as some of you are aware, We have had to conduct a cesium test To verify the authenticity

Why is she taking that tone?<eos> Oh, she just doesn't like being pinned as a murder suspect.<eos> No. I can deal with that.<eos> What I don't like is having every piece of information I give you double-checked.<eos> What can I do for you?
It got so bad, we actually hired a private security firm for a while to run down some of the threats we got in the mail.<eos> Is there a chance we could take a look at the information they developed?<eos> It could be helpful.<eos> Of course. Yeah.<eos> Daphne will put it together for you.
The doctor said it looked like a ring, too.<eos> But it's hard to tell the shape on multiple wounds.<eos> Don't contact me anymore.<eos> - But if you remember...<eos> - Then I'll call you.
- Dad, it's on now.<eos> - Coming, coming.<eos> We're going to debate the key election issues.<eos> Each party leader will get two minutes to deliver their closing remarks.<eos> We'll shut off the mikes after two minutes, and that goes for all of you.
I know what I want to do.<eos> Mom, Dad, this is Kara.<eos> My cousin? Your niece?<eos> Mr. Kent, Mrs. Kent.<eos> It's so nice to finally meet you.

A little respect, okay?<eos> Would you all like to go and see her?<eos> It's right this way.<eos> Thank you. Thanks.<eos> I'll check on you in a few minutes.

Now, whether they listened, whether they paid enough attention...<eos> I know that when they were outside the office, Ryland seemed to be cracking jokes all the time.<eos> The door was open and I found it distracting.<eos> I'd just like to express my deepest sympathies.<eos> I know how hard it must be for you, but I hope this verdict helps.
- Sorry about that.<eos> - Here you go. Have a good time.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> How can I help you?

Clean it up.<eos> I am so fucked.<eos> Charlie, get my shin/knee.<eos> Welcome to Ta-Ta's.<eos> I've got a table waiting just for you.
Good sounds abound when the mouth is round.<eos> Round.<eos> Round.<eos> I think we can make this work.<eos> I'll call you this afternoon and let you know.
Thomas, just look on the side if there's a vest there?<eos> I'm just concerned about my family.<eos> - Don't worry about the vest, it'll be fine.<eos> Rights groups have demanded that mercenaries should comply with all UYO regulations in District 9.<eos> We're coming to you from the entrance of District 9 as today, Multi National United sets out to relocate approximately 1.8 million alien residents from their homes.
732, copy.<eos> Service road 54, under the I-90 overpass.<eos> I've got a possible 10-29 Victor.<eos> Be safe, 732.<eos> Um, I'm really sorry that it's taken me so long to get this together for you, but it's, it's pretty standard, Mr. Wilson.
Your name is Caroline.<eos> You don't know this, but you're being fooled.<eos> You're being used. Okay, I'm giving you one last chance to leave.<eos> Joel, please don't make him angry.<eos> I would never hurt you.
But the fall also caused a more serious hemorrhage.<eos> He never regained consciousness.<eos> I don't think he suffered.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'II take you to him.
Look at this place.<eos> You'd almost think nice people lived here. Hey, be nice.<eos> And there's the devil herself.<eos> Mr. and Mrs. Tappan!<eos> I haven't seen you in forever.
In the van. Come on.<eos> Hi, I'm Lieutenant Brown. Ma'am.<eos> Look, try not to be... too distressed about all this, okay?<eos> Because right now, we're just assessing the situation, all right?<eos> Now, I appreciate if you stay here in the van so when I need you, I know where you are.
Ok, we'll send you the necessary.<eos> Careful!<eos> It's on it's way.<eos> Fantastic!<eos> Lovely to see you guys.
- I apologize.<eos> - Never apologize.<eos> OK.<eos> Sorry.<eos> - Sorry. I should have let you know.
The victim was found shot in his car on the grounds of the Santa Rosa Hospital, a private mental health facility.<eos> OK. Let's go get him.<eos> Police identified their suspect in the shooting as a patient who escaped earlier this evening,<eos> Hugo Reyes.<eos> Now, if that name sounds familiar to you, that's because Reyes was a member of the infamous Oceanic Six.
Have you, uh, turned into one of those people?<eos> - Sorry, Alexandra.<eos> - You Menshevik!<eos> - This is Leon.<eos> - Wait, wait! Stop, stop, stop, stop. Both of you.
He just seemed very-- he seemed really scared.<eos> Stressed out?<eos> who isn't? there's a spaceship above our city.<eos> He's been my partner for seven years. he's always had my back.<eos> Were the two of you romantically involved?
Hey, Ben, you going to the game tomorrow?<eos> Uh... I hope so, Molly.<eos> Just got hit with some serious, uh, homework.<eos> You know Benji, all work and no play.<eos> Seriously, look, that's the best I can do for you.

Who are you calling?<eos> Your mum.<eos> Oh, get out of here.<eos> - We've got nothing else to say to you people.<eos> - We're not here for you.
And here he is, Recep Ivedik.<eos> But what the hell should I say? What the fuck am I going to talk about?<eos> Just talk about globalisation, about the economy, come on you'll be fine.<eos> Alright then. Get lost now.<eos> Yes, I greet you all with respect.
Why?<eos> Great party!<eos> I'll see you later!<eos> I'm sure you can explain all this, but frankly,<eos> I've had enough of your explanations, so that's why I brought you some babysitters.
Truly alone.<eos> It's okay if I don't like you, right?<eos> Of course.<eos> But you do.<eos> Mr. Weaver will be right with you.

We want answers.<eos> Why isn't anybody telling us anything?<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking.<eos> It's about fucking time.<eos> Certainly want to thank you for all your patience.
Ja, it's not our philosophy to punish the kinder for the sins of their parents, Mr. Sanford, and Miss Donovan, she assures me that Widmark's starring role in the...<eos> - The science-sical. - Ja, science-sical is based solely on merit.<eos> Now if you excuse me, I have a lot of work to do, please.<eos> Good afternoon.<eos> Nice to see you again.
Dude!<eos> What's new?<eos> Since you saw me on the forensic platform five minutes ago, not much.<eos> - Great.<eos> - You?
This is art cavalleri.<eos> He's the private investigator one of you hired to wiretap and obstruct our investigation.<eos> Really?<eos> He's agreed to talk in exchange for leniency.<eos> I called you down here to offer you the same deal.
You know, the best birthday of my life was the surprise party that my parents threw.<eos> I... I... I loved it so much.<eos> How old were you at this party?<eos> 7. Like I said, it speaks for itself.<eos> If there's... if there's anything that we can get for you, uh, help you with, please just... just, uh, let us know.

Like I said, it speaks for itself.<eos> If there's... if there's anything that we can get for you, uh, help you with, please just... just, uh, let us know.<eos> I... I'd be more than happy to oversee any packing that you need done from his room.<eos> I've already arranged for a car if... it's ready to take you home anytime.
Probably sexual.<eos> Kurt Bessette was sleeping with that 18-year-old girl.<eos> I used that knowledge to ask for our five grand back for the phone.<eos> Kurt wouldn't have agreed if it weren't true.<eos> If I were you, I'd be looking at Paige's father for this murder, not my Elliot.
I have devoted my life to preserving my country's antiquities.<eos> You knew about the CAT scan. You had access to the mummy.<eos> I didn't know about the ruby, and if I did, I would've insisted on additional security.<eos> That ruby is a national treasure.<eos> I am holding you responsible for losing it.
He just seemed very- he seemed really scared.<eos> Stressed out?<eos> who isn't? there's a spaceship above our city.<eos> He's been my partner for seven years. he's always had my back.<eos> Were the two of you romantically involved?
I'm not gonna bump,and it was not hilarious.<eos> It was very,very terrifying.<eos> Truthfully,it wasn't the way he fell in.<eos> It was how long it took him to get out.<eos> And we'd like to offer you 15% off your first purchase as our way of welcoming you to the area.
I'm sure he'll fill you in on the details.<eos> Well, I'd appreciate it if next time you wish to speak To a member of my family, you call me first.<eos> I'm sorry, ma'am.<eos> That's not our practice.<eos> Can I walk you to the elevator?

Good morning, Mr. Beale.<eos> Hello, Robert.<eos> - Hello, hello.<eos> Molly!<eos> We didn't expect you till later this afternoon.
He has squandered his reputation, and he is forced to live in the woods like an animal with the shame of being a criminal.<eos> If there is one absolute truth in this world, it is that crime does not pay.<eos> You say the bullet hole is behind his right shoulder?<eos> Yes. Then all we have to do is figure out a way to get him to remove his shirt.<eos> I was half expecting you.
Is this more of that Tornado nonsense?<eos> We shall see who is the one who will be saying nonsensical things that are something of nonsense.<eos> Well, I suppose I must bow to the inevitable.<eos> Please, come inside.<eos> I'll join you in a moment.

In October 1998, three scientists from Health Canada testified before a senate commission in order to stop the approval of the transgenic hormone. The scandal was made public by whistleblower Dr. Shiv Chopra.<eos> ... shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.<eos> So help me God. My question to myself was: what truth am I going to tell?<eos> The one I know or the one the Ministry is telling me to tell? And that was my conflict...<eos> - I would ask each one of you, have any one of you been lobbied by Monsanto?
Do you think Priscilla was capable of hurting her child?<eos> Max?<eos> - You want to say no, but... - No!<eos> I'm sorry we couldn't be more helpful.<eos> I can show you out. Thanks for your time.

You can come with me now, spend a few hours in a makeshift tent watching an extremely slow-moving robot, or you can head off to a Hollywood movie studio.<eos> Either way.<eos> Oh, goodness.<eos> Is this where they do "dancing with the stars"?<eos> I'd like to welcome you to vintage studios.

- She died during childbirth.<eos> When she was admitted, she claimed she wasn't even pregnant.<eos> You worked with Dr. Bishop, manipulating growth hormones at the end of the Vietnam War.<eos> Yes.<eos> So, what can I do for you?
No, it's of no interest to me.<eos> Do you have your family's shipping records from that time?<eos> Oh, you'll get no help from me.<eos> You see, in my opinion, my forefathers, they did nothing wrong.<eos> No offence to either of you, of course.
We're talking with Bree Van De Kamp, Fairview's premier caterer, who's about to publish her very first cookbook.<eos> Bree, could you show us inside?<eos> This is my kitchen and this is my staff, the most gifted, hard-working team a cook could ever have hoped for.<eos> I cannot say enough good things about them.<eos> So which one of you has worked with Bree the longest?

I'll let you handle it. And if they ask about the e-Symposium?<eos> I was just shaking things up.<eos> I was trying to inject a little salutary controversy the way that an oyster needs a small bit of grit to make a pearl.<eos> Believe me, I got this.<eos> Mr. Barton will see you now.
-Nervous. -You should be.<eos> In a few hours, you'll be the most powerful person in the world.<eos> As if you're not already hard enough to live with.<eos> -Ma'am. Mr. Taylor. -Tom.<eos> The president apologizes he could not be here to greet you.
- You're crying?<eos> - Don't be ridiculous.<eos> Okay! There's no reason to...<eos> Everyone's here.<eos> Mr. Lambert will see you shortly.

I don't need any more grief from the Chinese consul and I definitely don't need it from you.<eos> Please tell me I did not just say all that in front of your parents.<eos> Chief Pope, I'd like to introduce you to my mom and dad,<eos> Willie Ray and Clay Johnson.<eos> It's a great pleasure to finally meet you both. - I've heard so much about you.

What's that, Keith?<eos> I found fish food floating in the aquarium.<eos> For the life of me, I can't make sense out of it.<eos> I suppose the guy who broke in decided to... feed the fish.<eos> I know this harassment - whatever the cause - must have been terrible for you.

And once I've finished, another life has been summed up - assets and debts tallied, then zeroed out.<eos> You initial here and there, you sign at the bottom.<eos> Then, if you're like most clients, you look up, smile, and you ask the question I've heard for 20 years: "Is that it, then?"<eos> "That's it for the paperwork, " I tell 'em.<eos> "The rest is up to you. "
We can continue to keep an eye on things for you, but my guess is your husband will hang up his dancing shoes shortly anyway,<eos> - What makes you say that?<eos> - Voice of experience,<eos> You give him some time, He'll be home soon,<eos> "The rest is up to you, " I tell my clients.
We'll buy the tickets.<eos> Oh, here.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We'll drop you off.<eos> I can assure you, everything is gonna be fine.
Emily, sweetheart, what the hell is going on?<eos> It's OK. I'm fine.<eos> This is my friend Jake Elowitch.<eos> That's my mom and my dad.<eos> Nice to meet you, Mr. and Mrs. Davis.
That's my son.<eos> I wanna do a song that has been especially written for tonight.<eos> - Its lyrics have been changed.<eos> It was an old Bob Hope number, actually.<eos> But we'd like to do it for you tonight as our way of closing and saying good night... as soon as Richie's finished with that thing he's composing over there.
- How do you do?<eos> Ted Milner.<eos> - This is Fire Chief Wickersham.<eos> - Chief.<eos> We won't keep you long.
Hello, Ana.<eos> And my daughter, Gabriela.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Very beautiful.<eos> - Good to see you, Mr. And Mrs. Puig.
My partner and I just witnessed your wife performing fellatio on you while you were operating a motor vehicle.<eos> That's reckless endangerment, which incidentally is a felony.<eos> We could charge your wife with lewd conduct and performing a sexual act in public.<eos> You say you're a block from home.<eos> We could use our discretion and let you go with a warning, or we could cuff you and put you in the back of the car.
I understand. Believe me.<eos> The Chief asked that I personally take you down to view the body... which I'm more than happy to do... but I don't know if it 's actually necessary.<eos> The examiner is going to have the DNA results within the next 24 hours.<eos> And then we'll know.<eos> We wouldn't dream of keeping you and the Congressman waiting.
The pleasure is mine, and i do mean "pleasure," and i do mean "mine."<eos> I've never seen kor-kavo so revoltingly social before.<eos> One of those two must have an idea worth stealing.<eos> Academician ler near and dr. 26carol.<eos> It's an honor to meet you both.
- Fancy a Slow Comfortable Screw, Ash?<eos> - No, thanks, Eddie.<eos> Hello?<eos> Sorry to phone you so late, Mrs. Winterborn.<eos> But I'm afraid that the midwife won't be able to get out to you in the morning.
Oh, yes, Mr. Gun-in-your-armpit.<eos> It was on my belt.<eos> He is a cop. Yes.<eos> Everyone is painfully aware.<eos> Now, I'm respectfully requesting that you remain in your room for the rest of the evening and that you leave first thing tomorrow morning.
Two. Maybe 2.5.<eos> Million?<eos> Yes, Lieutenant, million.<eos> Actually, we'll find out for sure next week. We're auctioning it off.<eos> I don't imagine any of you will be bidding on it.
Hey, good choice.<eos> That's the ultra 4000. The strongest safe in the world.<eos> Hi, I'm Kurt wolff. - Welcome to wolff security. - Oh, thank you, thank you.<eos> I'm, I'm Sharona, and this is Adrian monk. Hi, how are you?<eos> All right, well, what can I do for you guys today?
- Get out, get out.<eos> - Okay. All right.<eos> Wait. Tomorrow night at 8:00.<eos> It's gonna be awesome!<eos> So, while I can appreciate your apprehension, let me assure you that the dip in company earnings is only a temporary one.
- He'll never agree to it.<eos> Well, I'm going to call him tomorrow.<eos> We got nothing to lose.<eos> The loving couples center offers many different workshops.<eos> Whatever your needs, we're sure you'll find one suited to you.
I've already prepared lunch.<eos> Nothing fancy... but I think you'll find there is enough to go around.<eos> I'm sure there is.<eos> It's just that we're rather a tribe.<eos> We didn't want to eat you out of house and home.
We didn't want to eat you out of house and home.<eos> Just because your husband has bought a few paintings... it doesn't mean you can patronize us.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I was thoughtless.<eos> The last thing we wanted to do was to offend you.
She wasn't even on the bill.<eos> How did they fit her into the lineup?<eos> - Oh, the best luck. The Singing Nun fell off her scooter coming across the Triborough Bridge.<eos> I guess somebody up there likes me.<eos> We have for you a really big surprise... because to coincide with the arrival of the new book...
Here, let me get that.<eos> I see you, baby shaking that ass<eos> Holy shit!<eos> Stifler.<eos> I've got something really nice cooking up for you.
Stars shining bright above you<eos> Great, there you go.<eos> - Thanks, mate.<eos> Good morning, good morning, good morning. Here, one for you. Good to see you here.<eos> - Good on you.
Without further delay, let's welcome our experts...<eos> Erik Molander and his wife Frida.<eos> Erik Molander was a longtime assistant to the famous Swedish director, Ingmar Bergman.<eos> Now he's supervisor of the collection.<eos> During this weekend Erik and Frida will teach you how to make these movies.
Some other chicken.<eos> As long as the marinade is the same.<eos> Sure.<eos> It's Svend's marinade.<eos> I have to ask you all to leave.
He didn't get specific, but something's going on in Washington that we're not supposed to know about.<eos> - Michelle, are you ready for me?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I've asked someone to join us.<eos> Most of you know Ron Wieland.
We don't knowthat, Mr President.<eos> Let's get on with the vote.<eos> Members of the cabinet, you've been presented with the evidence.<eos> You know what's at stake.<eos> Those of you who believe the president is able to continue in office, vote yes.
We believe your son was infected with the virus in Mexico before he came home.<eos> We have three hours to find him before he becomes contagious.<eos> What are you saying? That our son could die?<eos> - Yes, that could happen.<eos> - Oh, God. Look, I know how difficult this must be for you and I'm sorry.
I'm gonna go find Dr. Lewis and see if she's heard anything, okay?<eos> - Hey. - Hey. These are my parents.<eos> How you doing? - Nice to meet you. - They were downtown, shopping.<eos> - Really? - And now they wanna join us for dinner.<eos> - I hope you don't mind.
As opposed to...? As opposed to asking questions at a scientific forum with words like "paranormal" in them.<eos> But I have no intenteion of keeping quiet, if that's what you mean.<eos> I'll be in the back.<eos> Suit yourself. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.<eos> I only have a few minutes to answer your questions about Sakovsky's disease. But first, I'm going to ask you to do something for me.
We've never actually met.<eos> I'm your route manager.<eos> I helped Joe here do some bin diving, dig up your invites.<eos> Really excellent paper selection .<eos> I'm sorry we couldn't complete the postal cycle for you .
Really excellent paper selection .<eos> I'm sorry we couldn't complete the postal cycle for you .<eos> Well, you want this or what? Oh .<eos> Thanks. Yeah .<eos> It was nice meeting you .
The whore dog who sells cars in Millsberg.<eos> Don't shoot the messenger.<eos> Okay.<eos> The bill's been taken care of by you, Mr. Dodd.<eos> I hope you've had a pleasant stay with us, and I wish that I could say I hope you'll return soon, but... I'd be lying.
Why can't I just take a cab to the hotel?<eos> When the circus came to town, did they let the elephants take a cab?<eos> You're the elephant.<eos> Get in the car, son.<eos> It's an honor and a pleasure to be broadcasting to you this evening with a crowd pushing 50,000 in this beautiful desert city on the shores of the blue, blue...
- What?<eos> You know him?<eos> (camp voice) Thank you, Mr Claremont.<eos> Well, this is very exciting, isn't it?<eos> We have assembled for you a very fine, very talented, world-class group of hockey artists.
Federal Bureau of Investigation.<eos> We'd like to ask you a few questions.<eos> - Can I ask what this is about?<eos> We've just come from a funeral.<eos> We know this is a difficult time for you.
- You've had enough. Listen to you...<eos> I'm sick of people telling me what to do.<eos> You just get us another pint.<eos> Fine.<eos> - Just a few pennies from you, there?
You didn't take a blind bit of notice.<eos> Look... If I were to cut your hair, Sister Theresa would not be amused.<eos> I'll explain to my daddy if he gets cross.<eos> And who will explain it to Sister Theresa if she gets cross?<eos> You, Sister. Hugh Canning reporting to you, live, from outside the Supreme Court... on the first day of this historic case.
Sir, what can I say?<eos> Tomorrow is just too early for us to...<eos> Ms. Matsubara?<eos> Oh yes, I worked at... Sanyu until I had my daughter six years ago.<eos> My job was proofreading, and I look forward... to working with you.
And... We'd like to look at a bed.<eos> In that case you'll have to move down the bus, please.<eos> Straight ahead and turn left by the stairs.<eos> Then sharp left again.<eos> I'll be with you in a moment.
Do I know you?<eos> We're Charlene Roth's parents.<eos> Mr. And Mrs. Roth.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't recognize you.
This necklace can only get us so far<eos> All it has to do is get us inside<eos> Horatio, please<eos> So, Senor Caine Senorita Donner, are you police officers?<eos> Well, actually, Senor ... we're Crime Scene Investigators And I'd like to show you something to see if it has any meaning to you
A hundred what?<eos> -$1 49,000.<eos> -And she left it to us?<eos> -Yes, she did.<eos> Which I'm gathering is somewhat of a surprise to you?
250.<eos> Get it done.<eos> It's done.<eos> Shit!<eos> I would like to extend a very warm welcome to each of you on behalf of all the crew on this Virgin Atlantic flight
Daniel Balint.<eos> Balint?<eos> It's German.<eos> Are you with the fbi, Mr Balint, or any other law-enforcement agency?<eos> I was about to ask you the same thing.
I'm kind of with him.<eos> That's cool.<eos> Buckle up, Allison. We're rolling.<eos> Oh, my goodness!<eos> Facilities are being provided for you and your families.
Your own key to the health center, Club 13.<eos> - You're official now. - Oh, look at that. And...<eos> Timberwolves!<eos> Tonight. Best seat in the house. - No frickin' way.<eos> Yeah, where's them bosses now, huh? The Minnesota Timberwolves would like to welcome you... to tonight's game between the Los Angeles Lakers... and your Minnesota Timberwolves.
- What are you doing right now?<eos> - Let's get together.<eos> - Not today, it's Shabbat.<eos> "June 18, 11 :30 Don't forget."<eos> Does one of you want to speak?
I love you.<eos> I'm willing to compound that equation with nurturing infinites...<eos> Or, you know, all that stuff that you said.<eos> Did I mention that I love you?<eos> I'm embarrassed to have pulled you from your busy lives.
Step into my office.<eos> I'm Wesley Wyndam-Pryce.<eos> These are my colleagues.<eos> - Hello.<eos> A pleasure to meet you. - What can we do for you?
Sheriff?<eos> Yeah, he calls me every hour.<eos> I can't get anything done.<eos> Every half for me.<eos> I hope we didn't embarrass you.
- I'm heartbroken. Your room is right this way.<eos> I should carry you across the threshold for good luck.<eos> You're out of luck. Oh, now, this is some style.<eos> I'll send your luggage right up. We don't have any, we're newlyweds. Who needs clothes?<eos> Can you tip the young man, honey?
- Describe the suspect for me.<eos> - He's tall, skinny, white.<eos> He has a red baseball cap with blonde hair sticking out of it.<eos> And he has on like a gray or blue, some kind of work uniform, I don't know.<eos> Wait a minute. - Is nobody here with you?
Ma'am, we're here with you.<eos> We're keeping the line open, we're gonna get you some help.<eos> Do not hang up.<eos> I'm gonna place you on hold while we triangulate your location.<eos> I'll be right back with you.
- Yes.<eos> I find it helps in understanding the child to know the family.<eos> And do you remain in contact with these people?<eos> When a child recovers, the family... will generally choose to forget.<eos> You've no degree. But they say you've a gift.
Instead of helping Jakob, you've made yourself unwell.<eos> Now you hear whatever you wish!<eos> - No.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Why would she speak to you and not to her husband? !
Did you know that barn cats have the keenest sense in all of nature?<eos> More astute and fine than any human being I hope to meet.<eos> Do you play the piano, Frau Zabińska?<eos> A little.<eos> Why don't you play something for us?
I wasn't expecting you today.<eos> A good surprise, I hope.<eos> Of course.<eos> Always a good surprise.<eos> I have another surprise for you.
You can expect a call from our lawyer later this afternoon.<eos> You've always been decent to our family, Cora but your son needs real help.<eos> And if you can't see that apparently so do you.<eos> I apologize that you had to witness that outburst.<eos> You're not going to punish him?
Talk.<eos> Couple months ago, we were planning a vacation.<eos> He wanted to get away.<eos> Doesn't make sense.<eos> I came to you... for answers.
One wonders if they will ever be seen again!<eos> I did my research on you. Genevieve Decoux.<eos> From New Orleans.<eos> Please, Mr. Delaney, we do not have much time.<eos> You sent the giant to kill me?
on behalf of the Honourable East India.<eos> No, no, no. "Full and willing cooperation."<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> And then... I will tell you which papers to burn.<eos> There is a Mr. Delaney to see you, madam.
- Hold back.<eos> We need that sword.<eos> They won't spare my life.<eos> Trying to save me is pointless.<eos> I promise a fair trial for Sergeant Malik and no case for you.
I'm busy.<eos> Please, don't come back.<eos> No, no, no, Miss Jackson.<eos> We just want justice for TJ.<eos> Don't you want that?
Good.<eos> I prefer honesty to pretence.<eos> That doesn't make me a spy.<eos> No.<eos> That makes you a challenge.
Since then, nothing.<eos> But whether he gets the King out or not, the raid is on.<eos> Things are going to hot up.<eos> The terms of your release are immediate deportation.<eos> You're to be kept under armed guard at the Ambassador's Residence until you can be escorted straight to the aeroplane and flown back to Washington.
You can't just run off on me like that, okay?<eos> I've told you.<eos> He was... He was just... He's all right.<eos> He was struggling a little bit in the water.<eos> I wanted to make sure he got back to you.
I don't see why not.<eos> Hi.<eos> Lainie Jensen to see Principal Bolan.<eos> Of course.<eos> Um... He will be with you in a moment.
He misses her very much.<eos> That's nice.<eos> He seems like a good kid.<eos> He's a very good kid, yeah.<eos> Tell me, how much is his life worth to you?
He's a very good kid, yeah.<eos> Tell me, how much is his life worth to you?<eos> Mrs. Baker, we shouldn't be having this conversation.<eos> Don't you think it's exactly the conversation that we should be having?<eos> My son is worth everything to me, as I'm sure Hannah is to you.
What the hell?<eos> No way.<eos> Were you just on the phone with your husband?<eos> Who are you?<eos> I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.
And now it looks like the guy's having cold feet.<eos> The dude's still a head case.<eos> Okay, well, anybody else?<eos> Next question.<eos> You, young lady.
Thank God he never reached his destination.<eos> But this was a man who hated the US government. You are the premiere symbol of that government in New York at the moment.<eos> And with the possibility of accomplices out there, I'm asking that we err on the side of caution.<eos> So. That's all, then.<eos> Is there anything I can get for you?
You said you had some names for me.<eos> Oh, that's him, isn't it?<eos> Your son, Andrew.<eos> Yes.<eos> I can't help but think how proud he'd be of you right now.
- Carrie!<eos> I can't.<eos> Mrs. Berenson?<eos> That's right.<eos> A man left this message for you.
That's far enough.<eos> An honor to meet you.<eos> I understand you're here at great personal risk.<eos> Thank you for that.<eos> And you, you're here at great political risk, so thank you.
Andrew Keane just ran away.<eos> Cowardice runs in the family.<eos> As I said, I have seen it.<eos> And I have to ask, why would you want to make a mother-- any mother-- watch the last moments of her son's life?<eos> I know it must be painful for you and I-I'm sorry.
You're only taking up one seat.<eos> May I use another kiosk, please?<eos> All right, a deluxe room, one king.<eos> Just a reminder, we are a nonsmoking hotel.<eos> And you requested that a rental car be dropped off for you here at the hotel tomorrow morning?
It's in your medical records.<eos> Just gonna affix some sensors for an electrocardiogram.<eos> Would you mind lowering your gown, please?<eos> The event chamber of the device requires an intense period of confinement.<eos> So we're gonna simulate that now while we're monitoring you just to see how well you hold up.
No.<eos> Wait!<eos> Stop!<eos> Go home, Miss Durst.<eos> This isn't for you.
Somebody who was there at Christ's last huzzah.<eos> So, that would make me Mary Magdalene.<eos> That would be Nora.<eos> Also conspicuously absent.<eos> You, Dr. Garvey, are one apostle, and one apostle only.
I just can't seem to do it.<eos> The closer we get to the end of this journey, the more the contradictions will accumulate... confusing issues we once thought were clear.<eos> I suppose the good news is that's how we'll know we're finally getting somewhere interesting.<eos> Close the gate!<eos> What can I do for you, ma'am?
One of the escaped convicts was a Min-Jung.<eos> You and she were cellmates, weren't you?<eos> The only thing I hate more than rhetorical questions... stupid rhetorical questions.<eos> Harboring fugitives, Mrs. Cho... that's a serious crime.<eos> I don't want to have to put you back in prison.
It's all right! I'll get you out!<eos> Please, open the door!<eos> Fred!<eos> - Fred!<eos> - I'm not leaving you.
- Dad?<eos> I can't add anything more to what Captain McManus said.<eos> The perpetrators of this armored car heist<eos> - are still at large.<eos> - Councilwoman Ayres, do you believe they're still in the city?
What are you talking about?<eos> My br... my brother has some mental issues, and he shouldn't be checking people in the motel.<eos> - Mental issues?<eos> - Yes.<eos> He made a mistake checking you in.
You mean the Ripper took her.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> Because you told me.<eos> I'll explain everything, but we need to go now.<eos> II don't know you!
Do you need to visit him?<eos> I spoke to his nurse.<eos> He's... .. paralysed.<eos> He wants me to go to him, but... .. I don't know what to do.<eos> I reckon this is one for you, Nurse Crane.
- No. She'll have the number 12, too, with the egg roll.<eos> - And to drink?<eos> - We'll have two Tsingtao.<eos> Your ID?<eos> I... I don't wanna put you on the spot or anything, um... but we're from the hospice.
Great, thank you so much.<eos> Bye-bye.<eos> Hello, it's Dr. Mathis and I was just calling to see how you're doing on the new medicine.<eos> If you're sleeping okay.<eos> If you still have anxiety.
There's a maintenance crawl on the other side of that wall.<eos> It should lead us to the elevator shaft.<eos> That is not going to work.<eos> Right.<eos> You'd never make that climb.
Right, and the donuts?<eos> In the kitchen.<eos> - Hey, I want that last fritter.<eos> - Oh, okay.<eos> I, um, actually printed something out for you while I was out.
Never disagree with him.<eos> Sure.<eos> Katie's remains have been transported to the forensics lab in Toronto.<eos> Okay.<eos> It'll take a few days and then we'll release her to you.
Is that correct?<eos> I'm sorry, Chrisjen. How is this relevant to the stealth ships?<eos> The Martians seemed very intent on destroying Phoebe before the Nathan Hale could secure it.<eos> I just wanted to know what Protogen was working on there.<eos> I'll check into that for you.
I still had time to claw my way back to the top.<eos> But not now.<eos> Baby Jane was my last chance.<eos> Maybe not.<eos> I read a beautiful script today with a wonderful role for you.
All it says is he's in transit.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I haven't seen your ID yet. - I'm here to see Maddie Kenner.<eos> - ID?<eos> I have a Katie Bowman here for you.
You know very well what I mean. I don't.<eos> Honestly.<eos> - What's dirty?<eos> - What's dirty? Dirty's dirty. That's what dirty is.<eos> But what's dirty to you might be quite acceptable to somebody else. - Quite normal, in fact.
So then you helped him get to the Serbian ex-Minister.<eos> Helped?<eos> Yeah, if running and hiding in a closet is helping, then sure, yeah, I helped him.<eos> No. I'm not accusing you of...<eos> You might not be, but your friend here keeps acting like it's a crime I'm still alive.
Mr. Clark went hunting on Wednesday and hasn't come back.<eos> I request a continuance until we're able to locate him.<eos> Your Honor, as the prosecution's case hinges on this witness' testimony, move for an immediate mistrial.<eos> I wouldn't go that far, Mr. Lord.<eos> Ms. Crew, this being Friday, I'll give you till Monday to produce your witness.
Well, that's just a piece of paper, though.<eos> That's true, but if he violates the terms, he's going to jail.<eos> And violating the terms means what, that he tries to come after me again?<eos> Ms. Jaymes, every one of us has been to Iraq, Afghanistan, and places you never heard of dealing with nasty, nasty characters.<eos> This man will not get to you.
That's impossible.<eos> You do understand the process of conception?<eos> Um, something to drink?<eos> Grey Goose, straight up, double it.<eos> - And for you?
You're in the shadows, obstructed by the man who you consider it a privilege to work for.<eos> Well, I'm here to tell you that your abilities have not been lost on us.<eos> My fund... The Fund for American Renewal... Its focus is the future of this country.<eos> And I believe it's you, Ms. Whelan, who is that future.<eos> So we're offering you $300 million to tell us about your ideas, your vision, your point of view.
How many strings are attached to this offer?<eos> I'm willing to bet there's at least 300 million of them. Am I right?<eos> Well, I guess that depends.<eos> - On?<eos> - You.
I have to call them!<eos> Please!<eos> Miss Whelan?<eos> Not now.<eos> I have a package for you from our friends.
And whom do I serve?<eos> Why didn't you ever run for office?<eos> I like getting shit done.<eos> And I like to keep my head attached to my neck.<eos> You father was smart.
Well, don't worry, I'm not here to proselytize.<eos> You went through something pretty horrible down there, whatever you're feeling is okay.<eos> I'm a marine. I'll be fine.<eos> You know, I served with your father.<eos> He would have been very proud of you.
I apologise.<eos> But don't ask me to pick sides, Lady Hamilton, because you won't win.<eos> I wish I respected you. But I can't.<eos> If it were up to me, you'd be out of a job.<eos> Then I'm very happy it is not up to you.
For letting them hurt us.<eos> And for the empty space they leave behind.<eos> But this will pass.<eos> You will survive, you will be stronger.<eos> I give you my word.
Gracie misses you, and we'd love for you to come back to the house.<eos> I've actually been expecting you.<eos> It's natural to feel resistance to the truth of the greatest day.<eos> After all, faith is about struggle, and I see how hard you've been struggling to accept your new reality, but I want to assure you, Mrs. Bowman, that I'm not just there to help Gracie and Charlie.<eos> I'm there for you, too.
Let's not get too worked up now, Mrs. Cutler.<eos> I'll be back tomorrow, okay?<eos> We always caught them.<eos> I'm sure you did.<eos> I'll get you an extra blanket.
We need a location quick.<eos> I'm going with ya.<eos> - They'll find him.<eos> - I was just trying to keep him from wandering away at night.<eos> I know the melatonin wasn't for you.
They're covered in chocolate fingerprints.<eos> Check out your hands.<eos> Yes, do give me a second.<eos> I can explain you?<eos> It's very important for you to know. We're not asking you to explain anything.
I'm calling them pot shots.<eos> Is cute!<eos> Marketing.<eos> Ma'am, I'm not asking you where that pot came from.<eos> I'm just pointing out that's something you didn't explain.
Ms. Carlson has no appointment.<eos> Mr. Yates.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Didn't you get my message.
- How's that sound?<eos> - Good.<eos> - Good. - Good.<eos> All right.<eos> I'll be back to check on you in a few minutes.
Don't give him a chance. Give one to Melinda may.<eos> Even though she would've stormed off 20 minutes ago.<eos> I like this woman.<eos> I'll wait a little longer. Thank you.<eos> For you.
- What?<eos> - The details are still coming in, but it appears to have been the work of a S.H.I.E.L.D. terrorist.<eos> Simmons.<eos> I'm so sorry, Madame.<eos> I know how much Dr. Fitz's father meant to you.
- I'm sorry, I don't really do much work with the legal sector.<eos> - Actually, I was hoping to use my experience and parlay it into the business world.<eos> - Well, I can take your résumé, but to be honest, I don't have a client who's looking for a candidate - like you at the moment.<eos> - I know you don't.<eos> In fact, since we're being honest, I know exactly what kind of candidate you're looking for.
I bring them this, the entire Inazagi board will fellate my toes.<eos> Hey, come on, guys, get back to work, 'kay?<eos> All right, man.<eos> Don't relax. Let's go.<eos> I don't work for you anymore. I know.
Do you know a man named Dwayne Clarke?<eos> No.<eos> - Dwayne Clarke is a well-connected lowlife who supplied drugs to someone identified by the initials T-O-D on the day Julie-Ann Collins was killed.<eos> Julie-Ann had that flyer in her bag.<eos> It was you she was ringing.
Mums always know when something's not right.<eos> I found... a photo of them both.<eos> Him and Julie-Ann.<eos> She mattered to David, didn't she?<eos> Did he tell you about her?
Oh, my God...<eos> The President!<eos> Uh, I suppose I owe you an explanation.<eos> Well, at least tell me you're still a Democrat.<eos> Madam President! Thank God, you're alive.
Are you telling me you know nothing of such financial matters?<eos> I intend to learn.<eos> Oh, a course in actuarial accountancy, perhaps?<eos> Is this interview over?<eos> I have no intention of detaining you any further.
That's not a problem, is it?<eos> No.<eos> No problem.<eos> Well, been very nice meeting you.<eos> If this isn't for you, let's say our goodbyes, shall we?
Travel section.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> No, no.<eos> I was, uh... dreaming.<eos> You should make your husband take you someplace warm...
Yeah.<eos> Me too.<eos> Yes, come in.<eos> The press pool is gathering.<eos> Are you sure you don't need anything else, ma'am?
He's just taunting me.<eos> Did you call the police?<eos> He looks like an altar boy and works for the FBI.<eos> How does that play out?<eos> What is it you want from me?
You'll ask for mercy.<eos> Mrs. Saperstein?<eos> Special Agent Robert Stahl.<eos> I'm with the FBI.<eos> - Do you have a moment?
Any distinctive marks on their vehicle?<eos> Look, I didn't see them.<eos> I didn't see the vehicle.<eos> Bullets were flying, and we were pinned down.<eos> Do you know anybody that would want to do you harm, or do Lieutenant Wozniak harm?
Without having it, it opens you up to prosecution.<eos> - That's the whole point.<eos> - I don't give a damn about paperwork, but I do need to hear what happened from your informant.<eos> So, where is she?<eos> - Ma'am, are you...
Sometimes, my boss makes personal calls on our office phone to England.<eos> It also says here that Cheryl's tattling cost you a big promotion.<eos> More promotions, more problems.<eos> Am I right? All right, here's a problem.<eos> So far, no one's been able to place you after that fire alarm went off.
It took me a very long time to understand that it wasn't my fault.<eos> Would you have listened to anyone who was telling you what you're telling me now?<eos> Come on, guys.<eos> This is not my time to stop.<eos> Your father was always so proud of you.
My dad.<eos> He's going to be very disappointed in you.<eos> You should prepare for that.<eos> He told you that story? About the climbing accident?<eos> He was proud of you.
Hello.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hello.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - These are for you.
It can be as fast as three days.<eos> Is that what happened to you?<eos> We're working for Lormong Vang.<eos> Su Lin, a man named Sawm Cheng has taken your daughter.<eos> I think he's planning to do to her what Lormong Vang did to you.
Each his own.<eos> Mind if I call the kitchen?<eos> Sure. Go ahead.<eos> Yeah.<eos> How are you?
Until further notice, you'll be reporting to me.<eos> Agent Ritter will be your liaison.<eos> - And Agent Foerstel?<eos> - He'll be at your disposal.<eos> You'll be provided with a secure office with secure communications.
And I hate the fact that there is nothing I can say or do right now to ease Sandra's pain, but I can make her one promise...<eos> That I will do everything in my power to make sure that not one more American family has to experience her grief.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yes.<eos> Aaron Shore is here to see you.
I'm not even asking for the President.<eos> I'm asking for the country.<eos> And I'm not really asking.<eos> Look, I understand that this is Washington, D.C., and I understand that you're a politician, but we have a chance to finally move forward on this thing, maybe even save some lives.<eos> If this vote costs you your re-election, I guarantee you I will find you a place in this administration.
No, it can wait.<eos> Today marks a milestone for the Kirkman Administration as he signs his gun-control bill into law, igniting hopes that this unelected, independent president can actually break the partisan gridlock that's paralyzed Congress for years.<eos> There's another big winner today... Speaker of the House Hookstraten, the moderate Republican who went out on a limb supporting the White House on this.<eos> These two have got to be feeling good this morning.<eos> Madam Speaker, this could not have been accomplished without you.
Look, not to mix metaphors, but there's blood in the water, Emily. The people I've sent this to know that.<eos> Okay. Well, keep trying. Yeah.<eos> Big swings, right?<eos> Exactly.<eos> Liam Price to see you.
Hi, Ruth.<eos> If you could just sign in for me.<eos> - Sure. - And...<eos> - if you could sign these for me as well.<eos> The doctor will answer any questions that you and your boyfriend might have.
I didn't say Matthew and I had absolutely decided we wouldn't keep her.<eos> I just came over to find out how the mistake had occurred.<eos> I'd better take her home again and talk it over with my brother.<eos> I ought not to decide on anything without consulting him.<eos> If we make up our minds not to keep her, we'll send her over to you.
And did you ever see such freckles? And hair as red as carrots.<eos> Dear, dear me.<eos> I hate you. - Anne.<eos> - I hate you.<eos> I hate you, I hate you!
- Front desk.<eos> - It's Ms. Denard.<eos> Can you order a taxi to the airport, please?<eos> There's a car waiting.<eos> A Mr. Beaumont ordered it for you.
Well, I was worried you wouldn't want me as a client.<eos> I wanted to get a chance to argue my case. That's crazy.<eos> Why wouldn't I want you as a client?<eos> Bitcoin.<eos> I thought it was all a bit too "disruptive economy" for you.
- Excuse me.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Second page.<eos> - What's wrong?<eos> Someone here to see you. Lenore Rindell.
I think we'll have to get back to you.<eos> In the next, two hours, or we go back to court, and destroy you.<eos> - Ms. Stevens.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I have an answer for you now.
And I wanted to point that out.<eos> So you put the episode online as a public service?<eos> Hey, look, let's not go overboard here.<eos> He's not Nelson Mandela.<eos> But I get your point. Counselor, do you have anything?
- Yale can wipe my ass, my friend. - Gentlemen, stop. - Can wipe it.<eos> - Stop!<eos> Now, look, I hate Yale as much as the next guy, but no one is helping their case by arguing here.<eos> Okay, I get it.<eos> I'm sorry. Now, you're arguing that he posted online... for career, not political reasons.
Do you think we can get our same rooms?<eos> I'll make sure things are exactly the way they were before.<eos> Welcome back to Grey House. Thank you.<eos> - Uh, who are those for?<eos> - Oh. You.
Well, then I'll leave it to you and the balloons.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Like mother, like daughter.<eos> I thought I could sneak in here without getting caught.<eos> I wasn't trying to catch you.
If you hadn't completely undermined me...<eos> - If I hadn't compl...<eos> - Then a little girl would be dead!<eos> Dr. Minnick...<eos> I don't believe that there's a place for you in my hospital any longer.
Are you sure having her here at home is the best thing?<eos> She'd probably be better off in a comprehensive care facility.<eos> I'm trying to give my mother the best possible care, and it's just I feel like she feels safer and happier with me at home.<eos> Maybe if you were here all the time, she would, but when you're gone, she's suffering.<eos> Sadly, I can't talk about this right now, I have to go, ok, but I'll talk to you soon.
I have been doing so much better this past year.<eos> Finally feeling less afraid, like I can take care of myself.<eos> This news really threw me.<eos> I can only imagine.<eos> May, I know this is difficult for you, but can you tell us about the attack?
Well, he can make something of his life here.<eos> But a boy needs his mother to become man.<eos> And if she is dead or in prison, she is no help to him.<eos> Do you see my problem?<eos> We wouldn't need much from you.
But it would look like an ordinary Mass. There would be nothing you could do to make it any different from a...<eos> Look, Father, you say "fancy frocks", but they're not just fancy, are they? They're white. - They're symbols of purity.<eos> - They're eight years old.<eos> Dress them in rags, they'd still be pure.<eos> Look, I'm not criticising you in any way whatsoever, Miss Pickering.
We said we'd never meet like this again.<eos> And I didn't do anything.<eos> Ooh, I want to believe you, Dino.<eos> Mrs. Murtaugh, you have known me since I was 15 years old.<eos> I would not lie to you.
Was there more than one?<eos> I want to say a prayer for my husband where he died.<eos> And then I'll tell you who he was there to meet.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I realised you hadn't eaten all day and your brother said you liked omelettes.
We got a mole.<eos> You mean, someone other than Reeves tipped off the pilot?<eos> Miller was never tipped off.<eos> And the fake transmission between Chen and him came to us from the VSSE.<eos> From you.
I mean, you could've picked any other day.<eos> But I'm so happy for you.<eos> Girl.<eos> You coming, Miss C?<eos> We got you backstage passes and everything.
- Yes.<eos> My mother wouldn't let me eat dessert unless I practiced.<eos> Then you must be a virtuoso.<eos> All right, hit it, Gay-thoven.<eos> Well, you were right.
I apologize.<eos> You're not a girl.<eos> You're a lady.<eos> I'm an assistant state's attorney, Mr. Linden.<eos> Well, very good for you.
She must've done whatever she was accused of.<eos> Well, she included her phone number.<eos> - Mmm. - And this.<eos> She's cute.<eos> So I read the report you wrote on James Weckler as his prison psychiatrist.
What the hell is my agent talking about, Jenna?<eos> Good question.<eos> What are you talking about, He told me that he's working with the CIA now.<eos> - Chen. He came to my house.<eos> Even has you and SecDef on his direct dial.
We need his help.<eos> And before either of you ruin what's left of our dinner, I get it.<eos> We're not gonna let Chen walk.<eos> But we're gonna hit the pause button on the investigation.<eos> Until you get what you what.
- In coach.<eos> - Not great at all, but we'll deal.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Four seats.<eos> That's you, and a minimum detail of two Diplomatic Security agents, and Blake.
Those ranks aren't part of the actual chain of command.<eos> Well, is that right?<eos> Well, you know who might settle that for us, is the commander-in-chief.<eos> May I borrow your phone please?<eos> I will get the part for you, ma'am, ASAP.
Is Sean Jeffries there?<eos> -Who's calling?<eos> -Who's this?<eos> I work for Tom Hammerschmidt.<eos> I don't understand why I was transferred to you.
What's the news from the Jordanian Embassy?<eos> Aidan Macallan still won't reveal what he did or didn't tell Petrov.<eos> Well, the president wants him brought back from his asylum to the United States immediately.<eos> I think we should give it a little more time.<eos> You know, I wonder if it was such a good idea to bring you in on this.
No, I don't.<eos> I couldn't care less.<eos> But if you make Claire happy, that makes me happy.<eos> -If you can help her, good.<eos> -What's it worth to you?
-I've been around your kind.<eos> Not usually at this level.<eos> But you can't help yourself.<eos> Make me an offer, Ms. Davis.<eos> What is she worth to you?
Gore Vidal once wrote that power is an end to itself, and the instinctive urge to prevail... the most important single human trait.<eos> I've always told myself that everything I did was for her.<eos> But maybe it wasn't.<eos> Maybe I love power more.<eos> For you, and for any dear to you, I would do anything.
I've always told myself that everything I did was for her.<eos> But maybe it wasn't.<eos> Maybe I love power more.<eos> For you, and for any dear to you, I would do anything.<eos> If my career were of that better kind that there was any opportunity or capacity to sacrifice in it, I would embrace any sacrifice for you and for those dear to you.
I think she's just happy and she wants to celebrate.<eos> A bit premature, don't you think?<eos> We haven't found anything yet.<eos> I am just so happy that God has answered my prayers and my grandson is back.<eos> All of Toronto is happy for you.
Your Honor, if I may...<eos> Well, I thought you were letting Wendy ask all the questions, Bull.<eos> Well, dare to be unpredictable.<eos> So, let's say you're at the movies, and you are sitting in a mostly empty row.<eos> What would you think if someone came and sat right next to you?
Are you even around enough to set an example<eos> - for your son? - Of course I am.<eos> Believe me, I had it worse.<eos> And so do most kids.<eos> College is obviously important to you.
Uh, they said that he died right after I left.<eos> I keep thinking, if I hadn't been in such a rush, I could've been there for him.<eos> I could've called the paramedics.<eos> But if what you're saying is true...<eos> The person who did this might've been waiting for you to leave that day.
Congratulations, ma'am.<eos> That's quite a haul.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I got lucky.<eos> Well, on behalf of the casino, we'd love to comp you a room, express our gratitude for playing with us today.
It was a five-dollar one.<eos> Okay, well, maybe you can, uh, win some more at one of our tables.<eos> Wouldn't that be nice?<eos> Well, I would have to be a magician, because that's the last of my chips.<eos> Well, uh, if you don't have any money, ma'am, I'm afraid you have no reason to be here.
You used the name "Brannigan Trust" as bait.<eos> Objection.<eos> Leading.<eos> Sustained.<eos> Would it surprise you to learn that you mentioned Brannigan Trust an average of seven times per call?
You know, one time I spent a month jogging on the same path as a target until it felt natural to introduce myself.<eos> Sofia's on the accelerated plan.<eos> She doesn't need him to get to turn state's witness.<eos> All she needs to do is convince him that not only suckers get conned.<eos> Didn't I see you in court?
- Yeah, that's great.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Hey, Callie.<eos> What's up?<eos> Um... did my father, Robert Quinn... did he have anything to do with you changing your mind about helping me?
Now I can.<eos> I'm sorry I'm late.<eos> Big day.<eos> You brought friends.<eos> And you are...
It's my belief one can't be overqualified.<eos> This job will not be without its challenges.<eos> I have no interest in abdicating my role as a mother.<eos> While I am in this house, I will be responsible for tending to masha's needs.<eos> You and masha will join me whenever you can, but there will be times I need to be unencumbered.
A couple of months ago, he got his hands on a logbook that contained the location of a sunken treasure galleon.<eos> And he approached Vestergaard about salvaging the wreck.<eos> Vestergaard turned him away because he'd filed a claim on the same ship over a year ago.<eos> You have the gear and the know-how to run the same kind of operation.<eos> So we think that Unger came to you next to try to strike some kind of a deal.
My time in the Triangle...<eos> Agent Orange.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Where is Owen Granger?<eos> This is for you.
- Let's get him ready to go.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> ♪ - I want to come with you!<eos> - Can't allow that, Ma'am.<eos> Ms. Williams, I will make sure you get a ride to the hospital.
Krilov was hired to adjust someone's memory.<eos> We confiscated his lab. So he stole yours.<eos> But your memory, the night of the fire.<eos> He stole it from me 25 years ago.<eos> That's why we needed you to get it back.
But in the meantime, he's in our custody.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I really wanna thank you, Agent Keen.<eos> I genuinely believe he would've shot me if you hadn't shown up.<eos> I didn't do it for you. I did it for him.
- Approach, Your H...<eos> - No need, Mr. Stone.<eos> You're out of line, Professor Bannon.<eos> True or false, Ms. Chapman?<eos> There's an outstanding order of extradition against you to be returned to Spain for retrial.
GED Prep<eos> Suwon City, Sinjung District 186-3<eos> I'm sorry, we're closed.<eos> I, um...<eos> Are you...
I wrote a puff piece about how Nixon fed Checkers food from the White House dinner table.<eos> Apparently he never forgot.<eos> I'm surprised I wasn't ranked higher.<eos> Hey, at least you made the top 20.<eos> So what can I do for you, Agent Memphis?
- Evidence. - Yep, you got it.<eos> - Of course.<eos> - But, um...<eos> Look, Ms. Gardner...<eos> I know this is a very difficult time for you right now, but when you're ready, of course -
- My job requires a reputation for discretion.<eos> - He'll never tell a soul, and your business will stay intact.<eos> - You lived a lie for years.<eos> You can't keep a secret about working one goddamn case?<eos> - We have a job we'd like to offer you.
Of course, while you're doing that, Lockwood's gonna be rushing your product to market, and when they do, your board's gonna be wondering why you didn't hire me when you had the chance.<eos> - All right, Mr. Specter, you win.<eos> You've got three days.<eos> Let's see if you're as good as you think you are.<eos> - You must be Paula Agard.
- I don't want a handout. But you made me a promise you wouldn't ruin my reputation.<eos> - What do you want me to say?<eos> What you do is dangerous. - I want you to say you make promises you can't keep.<eos> And by the way, you wouldn't have sent that Rachel woman back to me if you didn't know<eos> - what I do is worth it. - Okay, first of all, I never sent anyone back to you.
You see? It's unstoppable.<eos> [grunts] 009, watch this now.<eos> It's the end of Black Ghost.<eos> It's like a science fiction story, isn't it?<eos> I guess that's what it might sound like to you.
So... you do have a boyfriend.<eos> Mother. He's not my boyfriend.<eos> Not yet.<eos> She likes to play hard to get.<eos> I bet she learned that from you, didn't she?
No.<eos> It's just a whim.<eos> What should I do for you?<eos> Put together a private meeting with Nanaka Hiraki.<eos> If you meet that condition, I'll publish with you.
Ma'am, there's something you need to see.<eos> It's, uh, something you all need to see.<eos> Uh, it was just dropped off anonymously at the front gate.<eos> (scoffs) Probably just more hate mail for me.<eos> It's not for you, ma'am.
Big day.<eos> Big hall.<eos> Big hall. Big hall!<eos> Big hall!<eos> Sorry to interrupt, but I need to speak to you about something you wrote.
Sorry for the mess and for the drama.<eos> Please, come sit down.<eos> Take that one.<eos> Good. That's right.<eos> And, you, that's a good one for you.
- No, it's OK.<eos> I know him.<eos> If I knew we would be talking about that troublesome little girl, I wouldn't have invited you in.<eos> I understand.<eos> I'm sorry, but... I need to hear it from you.
She must be well-trained in the fighting styles of the Kyoto masters, and the weapons and tactics of modern Europe.<eos> Or the term would only be half-deserved.<eos> And you know six such women?<eos> I wonder now at your knowing any.<eos> Are you so severe on your own sex?
You act as if the undead had already defeated us.<eos> I think you and i understand each other, Liz Bennet.<eos> Well, the way you championed me earlier, i thought...<eos> Mr. Darcy's treatment of you has been utterly despicable, but...<eos> No more despicable than his treatment of you and your family.
There are some words i must say.<eos> Please do be seated.<eos> Miss Bennet, although I know many consider you to be decidedly inferior, as a matter of your birth, your family, and your circumstances, my feelings will not be repressed.<eos> In vain have I struggled.<eos> I have come to feel for you a most ardent admiration and regard, which has overcome my better judgment.
Let's just say. I put him in a hole and threw away the hole.<eos> Harley Quinn.<eos> Before she ran off and joined the circus... She was known as Dr. Harleen Quinzel. A psychiatrist at Arkham Asylum.<eos> She was assigned to The Clown himself.<eos> Dr. Quinzel. You know, I lived for these moments with you.
And President Johnson?<eos> President Johnson would like nothing more than to fulfill your wishes, but I have to take into account his safety.<eos> The country couldn't endure another blow should anything...<eos> It's not the same.<eos> If it were up to him, he'd do anything that might bring you comfort.
Mrs. Kennedy has expressed her desire to re-inter the bodies of the two children they lost to rest alongside their father.<eos> You got that part, right?<eos> She wants them to always remember, for one brief, shining moment, there was a...<eos> Yeah, Camelot. Yeah.<eos> I hope you have a good night, Mrs. Kennedy.
Well, we call her Maggie, so really, Maggie's her name.<eos> - Can you just... - She's all right.<eos> She's fine, she's like... a little...<eos> I'll put her in gymnastics when she's older, for sure.<eos> Oh, my God! I have something for you.
- Why, thank you.<eos> Let me do this.<eos> Mrs. Cole? She's coming?<eos> I tried.<eos> Oh, Miss Pugh, your uncle's here to see you.
They're getting him back in again.<eos> We should stop him before he betrays us.<eos> Set the date for the six.<eos> If his condition deteriorates, pull him out.<eos> - You father...
Even if everyone else went and left us, we're still here. You and me.<eos> Good morning, miss gray.<eos> I'm going to be giving you some twilight sedation for the procedure.<eos> Okay, what's that mean?<eos> It means you won't feel any pain, but you'll be slightly aware of the room and what's going on.
Hey, I know they are a couple of good men doing a difficult job but only worked there for a short time. Should talk to someone who worked at Loomis when David Ghantt he committed his atrocities.<eos> That's what we did.<eos> Do you know what they told us?<eos> We talked to Kelly Campbell, because they were close.<eos> They even hinted that David Ghantt felt something for you.
Now, there is a position in our clerking office.<eos> You will start in files but in time<eos> This isn't about China, is it?<eos> It's because I turned you down, when you asked me to marry you?<eos> I'm sorry Miss Kingsleigh, but this is all we can do for you.
The barber on Main Street will receive my instructions.<eos> He has the proper instruments for the incisions.<eos> Draining blood is known to be most effective treatment following stroke.<eos> We shall consider that avenue once James is well enough for such a procedure.<eos> You are not a physician, Mrs White.
And then, among the fishes, a whale!<eos> Lying at the bottom of the Indian Ocean<eos> Emerald City.<eos> Beautiful.<eos> Now, Rocky is radio active, but, what he needs from you is an import license.
- Now it hangs...<eos> - Over the bed of the Sultan of Hajar.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Excuse me, Miss.<eos> The other night, you took something that doesn't belong to you.
Remarkable.<eos> Mrs. Segal, I need that box of copies.<eos> Oh, no, no.<eos> Simon made me promise not to give it to anyone.<eos> No, no, you keep billing the firm.
The way your husband did.<eos> What you hoping to find?<eos> Dr. Tennant told me not to come back without the patient file.<eos> He's try to call.<eos> Do you have the PID?
Precisely.<eos> Well, it's just like you remember it.<eos> In fact, I've made it even more spectacular.<eos> No, you haven't. Shh.<eos> Come see for yourself. A special performance just for you.
- Affluent people?<eos> - Yes, very.<eos> The victim, the deceased, Mr. Boone Lassiter, he was one of these people.<eos> Yes.<eos> And were you always on his flights?
So lodging, transport, chow and protection, that's all you can accept?<eos> I'll do my best to stay objective.<eos> I don't care if you can do your job.<eos> I care if my men can.<eos> Are you familiar with the term "four-ten-four", Miss Baker?
I was wondering if you'd like to comment on your father's passing.<eos> How did you get this number?<eos> I realize it's an awkward time. It's an opportunity for you...<eos> Ms. Leblanc?<eos> Are you feeling anger?
This is Richard.<eos> Leave me a message.<eos> How are you feeling?<eos> How am I feeling?<eos> Are you dizzy? Head spinning?
It's sheepskin.<eos> Cabretta.<eos> It's lovely.<eos> They've been shipped from the same ports in Africa for hundreds of years.<eos> You want to learn about gloves? We'll make you up a pair.
It must stink.<eos> I smell nothing.<eos> Is that the book you're reading?<eos> I've finished it.<eos> I'll lend it to you.
You're gonna need your strength for tomorrow.<eos> Get some sleep.<eos> Will you stay with me?<eos> Always.<eos> - What can I get you?
- Oh, I'm looking for a guy.<eos> Um, no.<eos> He's... he's just not any guy.<eos> He's British, maybe.<eos> Can I get you something to drink or not?
I don't know, what a life those gentlemen lead.<eos> Huh, yes.<eos> Those gentlemen!<eos> Oh, never you mind.<eos> Oh, almost forgot, that came for you.
- No. - Okay. I'll just leave it open.<eos> She looks mean.<eos> This is embarrassing.<eos> Hi, this is my Ruthie.<eos> She's starting with you tomorrow.
You see what I'm talking about here.<eos> Mr. hutchinson, could you please look that over for me?<eos> I have my own copy, this is for you.
A pleasant term for enemies, is it not?<eos> And since he's your enemy as well, you must, in point of fact, be my friend.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I could use a friend.<eos> Accept this mixture as my gift to you and your husband.
Ladies and gentlemen, the Verdi Club presents the Ride of the Valkyries!<eos> Oh!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Bravo!<eos> It is my pleasure to present you with this small token of our esteem.
Dr Hertz is in Washington, but he sent his colleague Dr Hermann.<eos> If I may, please.<eos> I didn't have time to look at your medical notes.<eos> The scarring is from syphilis.<eos> When did you contract the disease?
- My great niece isn't married.<eos> - You mean the podiatrist?<eos> - What, with the lovely hands?<eos> - Madam Florence?<eos> It's you!
Any time, day or night.<eos> Even if you have plumped for a hospital delivery over us.<eos> Because they keep you in for ten days, till they're quite sure you're ready to be at home.<eos> And till they're sure baby's ready too.<eos> You and baby will be a pair.
Is there someone with you, Mrs Dawley?<eos> No. No, there's no-one.<eos> I'm alone.<eos> Now breathe through it...<eos> I'm going to stay on the telephone till it's passed. Then I'm going to come straight to you.
We have an emergency.<eos> Please fetch a midwife.<eos> I shall go at once.<eos> Midwife's on her way.<eos> I'm going to stay on the telephone with you until she gets to you.
As in the wading bird, or industrial lifting equipment, whichever you prefer.<eos> Ulcer clinic is on Friday afternoons.<eos> We've been experimenting with a new antibiotic powder... Which I will be delighted to discuss with Dr Godfrey.<eos> It's cutting-edge stuff like this that brings me out of retirement time and time again!<eos> I imagine you feel the same.
I'm okay. Luke covered me.<eos> He said he didn't move because he didn't want them to shoot again.<eos> - You see who did this?<eos> - No, Mama.<eos> Excuse me, ma'am. Will you come with me?
Well, Renautas has poured billions into this.<eos> We've sent them all over the world.<eos> We can't force people to join us but we can give them the opportunity to.<eos> Ms. Kravid?<eos> Phone for you.
Let me in.<eos> I'll deliver Parsons, the files,<eos> And if he's out there, I'll give you Bourne, too.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I appreciate you enthusiasm.
How are you this morning?<eos> Oh, well, we have a cook.<eos> He's black, he makes grits with secrets... and he's hanging out in our kitchen.<eos> So, what kind of a deal did Richard make with you?<eos> I was just asked to cook for you and your child... till you passed on, ma'am.
- You okay?<eos> - No.<eos> Use the ball of your foot. - How far are you?<eos> - Oh, God. I'm just around the corner.<eos> Well, we'll help you.
You not only have the Force's thanks, mate, you have the thanks of your town.<eos> Dr Macy?<eos> It's Dr Polly Sutton here.<eos> Yes?<eos> I'm calling about a blood sample you dropped off for your patient, Kade Fisher.
So that we don't find real happiness.<eos> I wonder why I left these small joys.. ...and running after stupid dream?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> There's a phone call for you.
Yesterday, Mr. Cochran stated that you had had one then.<eos> I did. And I didn't.<eos> I make it today.<eos> Ms. Lopez, we called the airlines.<eos> They don't show any reservation for you, at all.
You're very good.<eos> My final speech is shit.<eos> But to be fair to myself, which I always like to be, the writing's no good.<eos> So change it.<eos> It would all just be farting, belching, and slapping without you.
Everybody occupied then.<eos> How soon this English Christmas is coming?<eos> It's almost here.<eos> Merry Christmas, Caesar.<eos> Merry Christmas to you, too, Miss Elizabeth.
It's made in Paris.<eos> It was stolen in Birmingham.<eos> My mother stole it from a house she was cleaning, 1901...<eos> No, no. It's yours.<eos> It belongs on you.
Yeah.<eos> Like Bernadette heard a voice.<eos> And what does the voice say?<eos> "Murderer."<eos> It says this to you?
Thank you, but no need.<eos> Our herbalist has what we need.<eos> I want to check there are no complications.<eos> Why not? It's a simple request.<eos> Simple for you, but not for us.
- Yes. - Jonathan Pine.<eos> - Nice to meet you.<eos> Thank you for coming all this way. I appreciate it.<eos> Pleasure.<eos> These are for you.
Don't you see that what you're doing is wrong?<eos> You don't understand anything!<eos> Oh, just go!<eos> Just... I hate you!<eos> If you please, miss, there's a lady to see you.
I'm more into models, not nerds.<eos> And... maybe cops.<eos> Oh. You were interested in her, weren't you?<eos> I was trying to persuade her to join my aerospace RD team.<eos> And how did that work out for you?
Uh, sure.<eos> Of course.<eos> This is all so unbelievable.<eos> Did you find out who did it?<eos> You and Jason were pretty close, weren't you?
This is all so unbelievable.<eos> Did you find out who did it?<eos> You and Jason were pretty close, weren't you?<eos> Yes, but I have no idea who killed him.<eos> You and Jason worked on a number of projects together? Yeah.
- I remotely accessed it, and it's got mostly personal stuff on it except for one large protected file, heavily encrypted.<eos> Yeah, but you cracked it, right?<eos> - Of course I did.<eos> - Of course you did.<eos> I'm gonna spare you the gory details, but take a look at that.
Like a baby.<eos> Well, last month, I was reading a Chandler novel and I lost my other handbag, so thank you.<eos> Got to stop doing that.<eos> "From Here to Eternity."<eos> Which do you like better, the book or the movie?
That's great that they foster talent like that.<eos> And I imagine you're paying it off as part of your deal?<eos> Yeah, happily.<eos> It's a pretty standard arrangement.<eos> I have to say, watching you in court today, it sure did bring back some old memories for me.
I apologize, I thought...<eos> We haven't formally announced it yet, uh, but... an heir!<eos> It's the most incredible news, is it not?<eos> Well, then...<eos> I am to congratulate you. I wish you and the Marquis all the happiness in the world.
Five outgoing calls to Frank Kovach that weren't returned.<eos> No incoming calls, no texts.<eos> Maybe he used the desk phone.<eos> Then why didn't he pick up when she called back?<eos> You're gonna stay put until you hear from us again.
That's grief talking.<eos> It should have been me on that construction site.<eos> A lot of people are glad it wasn't.<eos> Give them time.<eos> You and Rita Martin were arrested together in the early 2000s several times.
Oh, my God, I can't believe...<eos> This recording wasn't in the trial transcripts.<eos> We had to dig it out of the original case file.<eos> No one tried to find this caller.<eos> You found her. You were her friend.
This recording wasn't in the trial transcripts.<eos> We had to dig it out of the original case file.<eos> No one tried to find this caller.<eos> You found her. You were her friend.<eos> Why didn't you come forward and follow up?
- Nope.<eos> - Agent Baker.<eos> May we step outside and talk alone, please?<eos> No.<eos> Detective Santos, you have the right to remain silent.
Go back to your review, Stella.<eos> I don't want the two murders linked.<eos> This is the third murder in three months, Jim.<eos> If we don't stop him, he will kill again.<eos> There's someone to see you, ma'am.
What are you two doing?<eos> You know you're not allowed to use the staff phone.<eos> Right, come on with me.<eos> There are two offices, ma'am.<eos> I've earmarked one for you.
Hospital policy.<eos> Sit in the chair.<eos> Thank you for everything.<eos> Detective Superintendent Gibson. I'm here to see Dr Larson.<eos> He's been expecting you. Please sign in.
If any memories relevant to the case return to you, please contact Louise here.<eos> We're here to help you, Mr Spector.<eos> We will guide you through this.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Sorry, ma'am. Rose Stagg is here to see you.
And with your baby.<eos> Have you found something?<eos> Do you know who killed Stephen?<eos> Not...<eos> Not yet, no. We've just got a few questions for you.
- No role? - Mmm.<eos> Of course, you couldn't have any role because the Senate Ethics rules prevent lobbyists from arranging overseas travel for members of Congress.<eos> Indeed.<eos> Do you know what this is?<eos> Perhaps we can get you a copy.
Guess you could call that some kind of prostitution, but worked for us.<eos> Until the night I had to call 911 with his hands around my throat.<eos> Really?<eos> Cops were quick, thank God.<eos> Did you press charges? Oh, yeah.
Yeah, we need to tell them that Hotel Echo isn't there any more.<eos> Is there somewhere else, another field base close enough for us to get to?<eos> Shit, why has she left the doors open?<eos> Caroline. What are you doing?<eos> I'm much faster than you, Dr Caldwell.
- No, I know.<eos> And I... we appreciate it.<eos> These are... Jill's personal belongings.<eos> I just want to return them to you.<eos> Look, I can only imagine how - hard this must be for you...
- How'd you do it?<eos> - That's the trick, isn't it?<eos> Just when I thought I'd seen it all.<eos> Wow, amazing what low self-esteem can do to a sociopath.<eos> I've been trying to reach you.
Honey, that's a deal breaker for me.<eos> It was that thin.<eos> Well, I see we're settling for less nowadays.<eos> That's beyond.<eos> Mrs. Morrow, a package arrived for you.
Hold on, I want to record this.<eos> It sounds an awful lot like you're asking for the day off after being three hours late.<eos> The truth is...<eos> I am so very sorry, Miss Grant.<eos> Because I respect you so much.
This is between me and Mrs. Woo.<eos> Yeah, but I'm here now. I'd like to know what's going on.<eos> Harry, please.<eos> Let me at least call the gentleman personally and apologize.<eos> Let me talk to Mr. Woo, and I'll get back to you.
What does this have to do with Harry?<eos> How'd you like to get back in?<eos> Back in?<eos> You mean like the bureau?<eos> I assume you started playing poker for a living 'cause nobody else would hire you.
I bet it does.<eos> Suits you.<eos> If you think this is grim, imagine what prison is like.<eos> If Carl Nash killed my husband, he deserves to rot in one for the rest of his life.<eos> Where do you think Layla is?
You and your stories, detective.<eos> She got to that safe deposit box the day after your husband's body was found.<eos> The box was in her name, too.<eos> She didn't have to wait for probate.<eos> What do you think's in that backpack?
By the time we get to trial, you will be.<eos> Detective Bosch.<eos> Ms. Chandler. Didn't I say our paths would cross again.<eos> Yes, you did.<eos> 'Cause according to you, I'm the kind of guy who can't stop stepping on his own dick.
I have a commitment.<eos> Oh, the hell you do.<eos> Pardon my French, Miss Dunhill.<eos> No, that's what I was going to say.<eos> I knew we made a good decision with you.
Twelve-thousand square feet of living space and, of course, complete privacy.<eos> It's lovely.<eos> For people in our... situation, which would you recommend?<eos> Well, you can pick a school based on the villa or vice versa.<eos> I have a packet of all those options for you.
We can provide fresh passports for all of you.<eos> No.<eos> Yes, their real names.<eos> If I may, I knew I might be doing this for your husband one day, but his choices aren't always yours.<eos> You and the children, you don't have to go.
Major Lincoln, MARSOC.<eos> Are you okay, sir?<eos> Yes, Major, we are.<eos> Let's get you outta here, sir.<eos> It's for you, Miss Winston.
That kid spends enough time in the clouds, okay?<eos> It's hard as it is to keep him here in the real world.<eos> This is not helping.<eos> Ezekiel knows a whole lot more about the real world than you think.<eos> Why don't you do him a favor?
My patients are like family to me.<eos> Just remember to eat soft foods for the next few days.<eos> I won't forget.<eos> Now, if you'll excuse me, I...<eos> Can I ask you a favor?
Good morning.<eos> I'm Becky.<eos> I'll be your temp this week, but I wouldn't mind being your perm.<eos> We'll see about that.<eos> I got you a double tall skim latte.
Red... you owe me for the Hawaiian.<eos> You watchin' this shit?<eos> Cleopatra was talkin' for reals.<eos> Guess you can't judge a book, huh?<eos> For you, Your Majesty.
You've conducted yourself with dignity throughout the trial.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Uh, but I know what that means. That's code in England for "I've shut up,"<eos> and I don't promise to shut up in the future.<eos> Miss Lipstadt, how convinced were you that this trial was going to have a good outcome for you?
Enjoy the game.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Ms. Rutledge.<eos> What can I do for you today?
I had to tell it.<eos> There wasn't anyone to help you out there.<eos> - You're like the others. - No.<eos> Elmer<eos> I'm glad you never had children.
Are you familiar?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> No. You wrote a letter to Attorney General Kennedy, is that right?<eos> Yes.<eos> He was not able to help you with your particular case, and sent your letter to the American Civil Liberties Union.
No, no.<eos> I get it.<eos> It's fine.<eos> Um, the prisoner showed up in one piece?<eos> Thanks to you, counselor.
You should let us get her down!<eos> It's not safe for you with all this dry lightning!<eos> And if you guys get hit, it'll be my ass!<eos> All right, we heard you! We got this.<eos> We're here to help you, ma'am.
It's up on AP, too.<eos> What is he doing?<eos> He knows that the military hates me.<eos> There are only bound to be more votes for O'Brien.<eos> We need less of those and more votes for you, ma'am.
Madam President, it is a huge honor, but I have to balance that against my need not to do it.<eos> Tom, I'm asking you as the President of the United States.<eos> And, respectfully, I am declining.<eos> I'm not picking up any respect.<eos> But you're getting the declining?
We are right in the middle of an interview with an exceptionally wonderful candidate for coordinating Nevada.<eos> Ma'am, it's just gonna take a second.<eos> - Apologies. I'll be right back.<eos> - Absolutely.<eos> - I got you a snack. - Oh, yeah, give me that.
One step at a time, in order.<eos> The numbers are the way we'll know that the Machine is functioning properly.<eos> Well, we don't have enough horsepower.<eos> Normally I'd loot a Best Buy, but...<eos> Yes, but without the Machine providing you a cover identity, you're grounded... or, rather, undergrounded.
I'm not seeing anything in applications or the operating system.<eos> Try the firmware.<eos> Something tells me he's not going to be making any more unwanted advances.<eos> Let's stay on task, Harry.<eos> Appears you were right, Miss Groves.
Are you.. Okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Do you want to hear an amazing story?<eos> Oh ofcourse.<eos> Would you like something to drink?
Oh, god.<eos> Hey, Dad.<eos> Hi, Chief.<eos> Let's do this inside, John.<eos> Mayor Warren, are you happy to have him back home?
She... she needs more than this.<eos> I can imagine it's very hard.<eos> It is.<eos> Both her parents have passed.<eos> We'll pay you.
Did you not read your copy of the will?<eos> Rod, um, I turned my own brother in to the police and they forced him into rehab and now he's dead.<eos> No, I did not read his will.<eos> He left you everything.<eos> After expenses, it all goes to you.
- And I admitted it.<eos> - Mm-hmm. Those encounters excited me, and to get into bed with my wife no longer did.<eos> Did you ever hear of such a thing?<eos> Go on.<eos> So we came to you. You listened to us, and you said,
No, I reasoned with that twat once before.<eos> I have ways to get her attention. I have ways to get her attention.<eos> Hi.<eos> I'm in the 8:15 with Steffi.<eos> Um, I don't have you on my list.
Yes, I see.<eos> I'm sorry you found the day so disheartening.<eos> Is there anything I might do to help?<eos> Nothing... Comes to mind.<eos> If you need a sparring partner... I'm sure Mr. Stark would be more than happy to hire one for you.
So she's a genius.<eos> I'm a genius.<eos> Whitney Frost... she defies categorization.<eos> It's open.<eos> A package has just arrived for you.
Come on.<eos> We got the rods.<eos> You interfering...<eos> Last chance, Miss Frost.<eos> Same to you, Agent Carter.
A little baking soda will help get the stains out when you're doing Stark's laundry.<eos> Well, everybody knows that.<eos> Oh, my gosh. I am such a klutz.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I didn't stick you, did I?
Chief Sousa and I will make sure of it.<eos> And I will be there to see it.<eos> What's that noise?<eos> That's Mr. Stark's telex.<eos> Do you recognize this code?
Where's Mr. Jarvis?<eos> Who are you?<eos> I'm Rose.<eos> I work with Peg.<eos> Mr. Jarvis said he'll be back shortly and that I should keep you company until he gets back.
You risked all of our lives for a personal vendetta.<eos> Which is not unlike you risking our lives to fetch a Russian assassin.<eos> You saved Dottie Underwood to assuage your conscience, and my wife, Ana, paid the price!<eos> Leaving Dottie with Whitney Frost would've been tantamount to murder, and unlike you, I'm not a murderer, Mr. Jarvis!<eos> And yet everyone around you dies.
Scalpels, needles...<eos> Nothing pulls this out of you, and I know you could give it to me if you choose.<eos> It will kill you.<eos> Let me be the judge of that.<eos> Miss Frost? Someone here to see you.
Thank you, Sid.<eos> - Night, Rayna.<eos> - Take care.<eos> Yeah?<eos> - This is for you, Miss Jaymes.
N... no, I haven't heard.<eos> He took his own life last night.<eos> Before he did, he asked me to deliver a message to you.<eos> He said, "Tell her... I thought I didn't have a choice."<eos> Does that mean something to you?
What am I to do with you?<eos> I'm ashamed of you!<eos> I'm always ashamed! You don't even know what dignity is. Or reputation.<eos> - The whole neighbourhood... - Easy.<eos> Clear off, you!
I'm here for Slean.<eos> Did the Skinshifter regain consciousness yet?<eos> As soon as Koll can be questioned, I'll be informed.<eos> Until such time, his wife is our only means of finding out who ordered the creature to murder my Reeve.<eos> I'll have her brought to you.
Please, Mrs Brindsley, calm down.<eos> I'm perfectly calm.<eos> Under the circumstances.<eos> What happened to your son.<eos> And I'm telling you that at present I'm not at liberty to give you any more information than you've already had.
Your hat? (GROANS)<eos> I was aiming for your mouth, but I rather think I broke your nose by mistake.<eos> I would offer to fix it, but I won't. Sorry, old chap.<eos> Mrs Collingborne? Yes.<eos> I have a telegram for you.
I don't know what else you want me to say. Please sit down, Mrs Scotlock.<eos> Are you going to charge me or not?<eos> Please.<eos> Sit down.<eos> After a great deal of deliberation... it's been decided that all charges of accounting fraud against you are to be dropped. What?
- To cure.<eos> Is there a difference?<eos> We've met before.<eos> I'm sure not.<eos> I mean, I've known someone very like you.
But not even then because you can't stop thinking about what you've lost, again, for which you blame yourself.<eos> So the cycle goes on, the snake eating its own tail.<eos> Or you can just have your teeth fixed.<eos> I'll come tomorrow.<eos> First, you've something to do.
But Noah's animals were living.<eos> Oh, I think of these ones as alive, just quiet.<eos> Taxidermy! - What?<eos> - Your hobby.<eos> That's where you touched a scorpion.
Uh, any ideas?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Who knows?<eos> I mean, half the world hates me because I'm rich, and the other half hates me 'cause the friggin' paparazzi love to make me look like a bitch.<eos> So you really have no idea who may have wanted to harm you?
Good afternoon.<eos> May I help you?<eos> I'm here to see Dr. Seward.<eos> Take a seat, Miss Ives.<eos> There are no emotions unwelcome in this room, and if this process doesn't appeal to you, the door is there.
This is the first I've heard of him since he left us.<eos> Mia said the police called.<eos> What's going on?<eos> My wife Amber.<eos> Were you handing out flyers at the fairground last night?
- No, thanks.<eos> No. There's been a few developments we'd like to ask you about.<eos> Now, you said Jamie hadn't been in touch recently.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Only, according to this... he called you six times in two days.
I bought these for him for his last birthday... .. just before he left home.<eos> When he was little, he used to hate having his injections... .. so I used to read to him, take his mind off it.<eos> Where did you find all this? Here.<eos> I'm sorry, love. I can't tell you that... yet.<eos> But I'll make sure all his belongings are returned to you.
I was at the site office. She was around.<eos> Did you see her?<eos> Mrs. Pevensey.<eos> You and Harris... you share quite the secret, don't you?<eos> We'd like to ask you some questions.
The Advance guys said I should come this way.<eos> Wait here.<eos> I'm sorry, Mr. President, we just can't do it.<eos> Forty-five percent of the vote here is African American.<eos> You and your mother standing by my side would go a long way to put this--
He woke up this morning and told me...<eos> When I asked him why... He said: "Papa, all these film stars are fake."<eos> "Sultan is the real hero.<eos> I want to grow up to be like him."<eos> Madam, he made a sketch for you.
Isaac did not do this thing.<eos> I know it as you knew your daughter lived, he did not do this thing.<eos> And think, Edmund, on what else that might mean, the true killer still walking the streets you once knew as home.<eos> You will have missed the last train by now, I think, Miss Goren.<eos> We shall make a room up for you.
Miss Ives?<eos> Can you hear me?<eos> I'm not good at this.<eos> My wife's got short hair... and I have no sisters.<eos> I'm sick to see you like this.
...by members of armed groups that have demobilized and are contributing to the search for the missing.<eos> In national news, the main news this morning is the funeral held in memory of Laura Vidal, the renowned photographer and visual artist, allegedly murdered by her lover, Adrián Doria, recently awarded in the prestigious<eos> European Awards for Innovation and Business Development as businessman of the year.<eos> Doria, who recently made inroads into the Asian market with his company Global Go Tech Media, is pleading innocent and states he is the victim of a plot.<eos> I was expecting you later.
Let's-let's all just find our wieners and then put the masks back on.<eos> Okay, 940, this is the house.<eos> Hi, are you Gretchen Mercer?<eos> Yes, may I help you?<eos> Oh, yeah, we found an old letter addressed to you.
What's that?<eos> This is an answer<eos> from the Red Forest.<eos> These leaves have been altered by disruption of space and time.<eos> I have no doubt they bring you visions, Miss Goines, but they'll also bring you death.
Order for me, okay?<eos> The usual.<eos> Oh hey, guy.<eos> Miss Goines.<eos> How are you?
You're of great interest to me.<eos> I finally figured out why you don't want to help me.<eos> Because the man I've been chasing for two years was your fiancé, Christopher Hall.<eos> You were with him for one year.<eos> During that time, he stole $5 million from your clients using information he obtained from you.
She was in and out of these places, So i know how it works.<eos> Um, always a bed for a-- A senator's kid or some ceo's son.<eos> I'm-- i'm failing to understand.<eos> Well, there should be enough here For the first two months' stay.<eos> And some for you.
Yes.<eos> He was The Executioner. Not the same person who killed my parents, but someone dressed like him.<eos> Can you give me a description of him?<eos> You know what he looks like.<eos> I need a report from you.
Yeah. I just haven't eaten.<eos> Protein?<eos> God, no, man. Put that away.<eos> Organize an autopsy before we do anything. All right.<eos> Hey, I'm talking to you.
- Cleaning up.<eos> - Why here?<eos> - It's for dad.<eos> When he comes, it'll make him happy.<eos> There was a letter for you.
We appreciate everything you do for us.<eos> Thank you.<eos> That was nice speech! Beautiful.<eos> Don't see that very often.<eos> Dáša here could learn from you. The cooking and the speaking.
I'm going to the pharmacy.<eos> Girl on the tape: Hello, miss Simone.<eos> My mother recently passed away.<eos> I just wanted you to know how important your music was to her.<eos> I'm sending you a picture you autographed for her and a necklace she used to wear back then.
Sergeant?<eos> A woman?<eos> Good morning, crew.<eos> I am proud to be here educating my country.<eos> For you, teacher.
Well, you choose.<eos> You're the expert.<eos> You know, I've chosen.<eos> You know, these girls, a lot of them, come from poor, disadvantaged communities... and this class could make a big difference for them.<eos> But I guess you don't care about that, huh?
It's why I do everything I can to diversify all my kitchens.<eos> I sit on numerous boards, volunteer, do PBS.<eos> So, forgive me if I want a respite.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> This is what MCC has decided is best for you.
We're all out. ...and we have to pull together, both sides of the aisle...<eos> We're all out for today. Sorry, come back tomorrow.<eos> - We're all out, guys. We're all out. - Are you serious?<eos> Come back tomorrow. We're all out for today, sir.<eos> Hey... can I siphon a couple of gallons from you?
Far too early for Courchevel, and anyway I prefer St. Moritz.<eos> Shopping and slopes.<eos> For a start, both my feet hurt after a while.<eos> I'll need a bath.<eos> I can draw one for you.
Right?<eos> That kid, I took his father from him. I did that.<eos> - Yeah, you did.<eos> Look, Frank, I can't judge you.<eos> That was tough in there for you, right?
Cornstarch, powdered milk, baby laxative, talcum powder.<eos> Dope has to be cut with something.<eos> Maybe when the drug analysis comes back, you can match the heroin we found in our victim's car to a specific supplier.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Detective Dunn, we appreciate your help, but I'm not gonna force you to revisit what must have been an extremely difficult time.
We're just feeling overwhelmed.<eos> Garden-variety issues.<eos> I think Orwell or Jade or Samuel or Heinrich had the light for a moment and emailed me.<eos> And you're here to tell me everything's okay.<eos> I emailed you.
That pant, it's got a red lining.<eos> You can see it in the long slit down the side.<eos> We have been talking about silk-and-wool blend for 20 minutes.<eos> Can I guess that you emailed me in the middle of the night for an emergency session due to garden-variety issues?<eos> I was down and I emailed you and I woke up and I feel better.
We're very similar, you and I.<eos> Both on the outside, looking in.<eos> Please, sit.<eos> I don't get many visitors.<eos> Uh, I'll get you some water.
At best, I look like an inept asshole.<eos> At worst, a lying sack of shit.<eos> That interview was humiliating, Frank.<eos> Not to mention, a 16-year-old boy?<eos> We are doing what's necessary, for this city and for you.
There you are.<eos> - You shouldn't have bothered.<eos> Just breathe. The drug will take her soon.<eos> Narcan. Heroin antidote.<eos> All the agents looking for you have it.
I do my homework.<eos> A deal this big, I want to know everything about a person.<eos> So, what do you know about me?<eos> I know this business used to be Ray Carson's.<eos> And now it belongs to you.
Mr. Graham, please.<eos> Let him stay here so we can keep an eye on him.<eos> - You may be risking...<eos> - You were supposed to take care of him!<eos> You!
I must ask you to wait here while I collect my thoughts assimilate them, shape them into a course of action.<eos> Can I trust you to remain in the house?<eos> Yes.<eos> If you are not here when I return, I will notify every police officer in London.<eos> You will be apprehended and it will be the worse for you.
What is your issue with me, Major?<eos> I have given you nothing but opportunities.<eos> To do what, exactly?<eos> Be your puppet?<eos> To smile and lie for you?
Oh, I... I don't know if they're still here.<eos> But can you please just send the police? Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!<eos> No, no. Oh, my God! Are you freaking kidding me?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> No, I'm s... Ma'am, I'm sorry. That wasn't for you.
Yeah, I really do.<eos> I like her, too... a lot.<eos> But not for you.<eos> I have other plans for you, Kyle.<eos> Mrs. Delatour, Marisol Suarez to see you.
Oh, he's fine...<eos> asleep for the night.<eos> Which means I can go home.<eos> Oh, Miss Shannon, I almost forgot.<eos> I have something for you.
Indeed.<eos> And now that you and Mr. Powell are separated, I-I don't feel right cleaning for him.<eos> Us girls, we have to stick together, right?<eos> Adrian fired you, didn't he?<eos> But now I can focus all my energy on cleaning for you.
Hey, is Mr Fletcher still here?<eos> Uh... he uh... got out while he could.<eos> Bought a farm in Tazzy, now he's herding sheep.<eos> Oh, not much different from his job here then.<eos> - Smith for you.
I'll get her back.<eos> And the jury?<eos> How do we make sure we get them back?<eos> It's a setback. I've overcome worse.<eos> My corporate attorneys told me not to hire you, but every judge and lawyer friend I know told me that we would need a woman if we had any chance at winning.
And this is Luisa, who received your son's heart.<eos> Luisa was at the top of the list. She was hours away from dying.<eos> If we could, let's all get together for a photo.<eos> James? Right here.<eos> - You come right here.
There are no ladies in my life down here, and my manners are rough. Huh?<eos> There.<eos> Your share of the Viking loot you won for me.<eos> - And this? - Ha...<eos> Some graft for you, if you would.
Any of us might. Why deny it?<eos> It's a life of... pretence.<eos> And I admit I've been pretending to you since the day we met.<eos> Pretending?<eos> Pretending that I don't love you more than I've loved another person in my life.
- Do you need help?<eos> - Poor thing.<eos> Sir?<eos> Sir. Oh. Are you all right?<eos> Oh... I was rude to you.
Seven!<eos> Seven mouths to feed.<eos> Yet, Miss Barbary here would see you all in the workhouse.<eos> You do me a disservice, sir!<eos> I've simply pointed out a possible outcome of what you propose.
What?<eos> And Daniel Lee thought he'd have time to swap it out, but little did he know,<eos> you were gonna kill his patient.<eos> You actually listen to this person?<eos> He had a hard time convincing us, too, until Dr. Kinder gave you up.
Quit the fucking games and tell me where he is.<eos> Unless you want to play games with me.<eos> What the fuck? !<eos> Let me go!<eos> Doc, are you all right?
Oh. Late on her first day.<eos> She needn't bother turning up.<eos> (SIGHS) So where does this leave me, eh?<eos> I should be out of here in days!<eos> - Which colour do you prefer, Madame Rennard?
This is the only store that sells them.<eos> What do you want me to do?<eos> Hey, you still carry L'errantes?<eos> Sorry, not enough interest.<eos> But I can order them for you, if you... leave a number.
Oh, i'm so sorry.<eos> It's all right.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Oh -- no, it's my fault.<eos> Let me get you another one.
Well, prove it. - How?<eos> - Well, did you get a receipt?<eos> Take a picture with your mobile?<eos> With this?<eos> I give you my word that's what I did.
I am happy to be here.<eos> Truly, I have been through a lot, and I'm lucky to be alive, and I'm lucky to be okay, and I get that.<eos> So, yes, I'm just happy to be here.<eos> Great.<eos> You know, Doctor, most surgeons, uh, get kind of rankled at hospital-mandated therapy.
Can I subpoena her bank records?<eos> You think this is a joke?<eos> You're damn right this isn't a joke.<eos> I'm being accused of a crime based on some bullshit email no one's even seen.<eos> I'd ask if you have that email on you, Ms. Gibbs, but I wouldn't want to put you in the position of lying to me, so let's have it.
Lisa Neil?<eos> Can I help you?<eos> I'm Agent Navabi, FBI.<eos> This is Agent Ressler.<eos> We have some questions for you about your father.
Tom Carter didn't trust you.<eos> He wanted you in his custody. He would stop at nothing to get you.<eos> He posed a direct threat to your life and to your mission.<eos> - I don't have a mission.<eos> But the kicker is, you can't account for the majority of your time on the night he disappeared.
How so?<eos> He came and did a big mea culpa about working on his issues.<eos> Stuff about his son.<eos> Even brought a formal letter of apology in with this.<eos> Why did he give it to you?
That was his job.<eos> That's how he earns a living.<eos> He's a person.<eos> And I'm a person.<eos> I don't just live to work for you.
The thief walked past paintings worth hundreds of thousands of dollars and ripped this one right out of the frame.<eos> - Are you with the FBI?<eos> - Yes, we are.<eos> Special Agent Weller.<eos> You are...
Blood pressure not bothering you anymore?<eos> According to your medical records that were released after the election, you don't have a blood-pressure problem, hence you don't have a blood-pressure prescription.<eos> So I don't understand why Liam O'Connor would blackmail me into swapping out pills that you were never really taking. I'm sorry.<eos> Were you asking me a question or making an accusation?<eos> I'm giving you a chance to tell me the truth before I devote my life to proving it.
Uh, go talk to Roger, see what he knows.<eos> What is he doing here?<eos> I'll handle this.<eos> You just be normal.<eos> Captain, you crossed the line.
He is no longer associated with the 12th precinct.<eos> So neither I nor the NYPD can be held accountable for his actions.<eos> So you knew nothing about it?<eos> That's what I said, isn't it?<eos> I don't believe you.
- How many?<eos> - I do not know.<eos> - Are you sure?<eos> - Absolutely.<eos> Graydon Carter is begging for a photo spread of you and Charlie Baird in "Vanity Fair."
Hmm? They say you look like a prisoner or a pirate.<eos> An exercise book.<eos> Why did Menopause not warn us that the Chinese were going to out gift us like that?<eos> Our intel suggested they hated you.<eos> Ma'am, Dan and Amy for you.
The wharfinger here, Croker?<eos> So it would seem.<eos> - My son, will I see my son?<eos> - Not of current relevance.<eos> I am sure some visitation might be arranged before... well, before the law of this land makes one further attempt to see you punished.
I'm not saying you have to be a writer.<eos> But you do have skills that would improve with a little hard work.<eos> I mean, why won't you even try?<eos> Because who wants to spend time doing something they aren't good at?<eos> I don't see you out there on the court playing basketball.
No, not for real.<eos> Yes, let's do it.<eos> Let's do it.<eos> One basket, you write the paper.<eos> One basket, I'll write you that paper.
Okay. Let's do it again.<eos> Come on.<eos> Man, I have never seen anyone as bad at basketball as you are.<eos> But good effort.<eos> I'm gonna write you that paper.
Come on.<eos> Man, I have never seen anyone as bad at basketball as you are.<eos> But good effort.<eos> I'm gonna write you that paper.<eos> Dude, no way is my paper gonna suck as much as you do at basketball.
Sorry I bothered you.<eos> What do you want my help with?<eos> Case.<eos> I'm trying to get my hands on a suspect, only no one seems to know where he is.<eos> It's been weeks now, and I actually got desperate enough to come see you.
- They worked with Dad on the union board.<eos> - Come on in.<eos> I'll send you the e-mail address that I want tracked and, I'm, uh,<eos> I'm hoping that Oliver Shaw can recommend someone.<eos> Are you sure there's nothing else I can do for you, or your family?
But if we could, I might have leverage to find out what the Saudis are hiding.<eos> Without it, it's just a bunch of puzzle pieces that don't... really fit.<eos> You can see why it seemed above my pay grade.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I hope it's appropriate that I came to you.
We survived.<eos> Lesson, don't ever take life for granted, always take good care of yourself, reject the latte and drink the green juice.<eos> Carpe diem.<eos> Ms. Grant.<eos> I just want you to know that working for you is a true honor.
Two bob. That's all I need to settle my bill for t'week.<eos> Stay.<eos> Please.<eos> I... I'll take this for rent, then.<eos> But I won't lay a finger on you.
No.<eos> There wasn't one fella in particular who complained about being cold that night?<eos> (MOCKING LAUGHTER) Hey, that's enough!<eos> Cheap jibes won't get you any closer to the truth, Mr Coates.<eos> You and Johnny are close.
- What just happened?<eos> - I can't even look at her. - Yeah.<eos> All right, who's ready for some piping hot tofurkey?<eos> Where are the tongs?<eos> Ma'am, I'll be happy to hold your sunglasses for you.
Someplace warm?<eos> Safe?<eos> Next to someone you love?<eos> I'll have a whisky sour.<eos> Good afternoon, ma'am. The American Union representative dropped this off for you.
Why don't you try to run in place.<eos> You want me to run in place?<eos> -The ankle you sprained was the right one, wasn't it?<eos> I want to see if you are all better now.-Oh yea.<eos> I am all better thanks to you and I received an active first class service after I got my physical examination.
We don't agree with this characterization but think it's irrelevant.<eos> Even in public colleges, students don't have unfettered rights of expression.<eos> Nothing my client has done rises to a level of...<eos> "Schools are allowed to prohibit any expression "that creates material and substantial disruptions "in school activities or invades the rights of others."<eos> And do you have any evidence of such invasion or disruption?
Do you need me to stay?<eos> No, I'll lock up.<eos> Okay.<eos> Please have a seat.<eos> I will be with you in just a second.
That is out of the question.<eos> - I see.<eos> - He means to run me, as he runs my mother.<eos> Well, then, you must have someone else.<eos> Perhaps I might act for you.
The carriage is waiting, Majesty.<eos> - So many windows.<eos> - They almost bankrupted your uncle George.<eos> How light it will be after Kensington.<eos> Did you find it so very dark there?
It's true your education may be lacking in some areas, but you have a natural dignity that cannot be learnt.<eos> You don't think I'm too short to be dignified?<eos> To me, Ma'am, you are every inch a queen.<eos> Lord Melbourne, when we first met, you offered to act as my private secretary.<eos> - You did not accept my offer.
I'm afraid we have evidence, Mrs. Thomson.<eos> He must have done it for me.<eos> This case will become a matter of public record soon.<eos> You're saying I have no choice now but to tell my husband?<eos> That's up to you.
He would have ruined me.<eos> Andrew Thomson, you're under arrest for the murder of Frank Parker.<eos> Oh. Miss James, please come in.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> I was abrupt with you yesterday when you told me about Mr. Desmond.
Wouldn't want to make you do anything you're not ready for.<eos> And what upsets me more than anything else is that while Gina's dead and Malaya is lying upstairs bruised and beaten, I'm thinking about us.<eos> Dr. Lorenson, thank you for coming back.<eos> We have a few more questions, specifically about Gordon Heshman.<eos> You and Dr. Angus Leighton treated him in center stage, correct?
Where to put it?<eos> - Ms. Moore.<eos> - Oh, God, is Drake...<eos> No, no, nothing new on Drake.<eos> I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.
What, you want to play a game?<eos> No.<eos> I want to check the scores.<eos> DTY.<eos> Why is DTY important to you?
How do you feel about today, Ms Ferguson?<eos> - Joan? ! Joan!<eos> - please, Ms Ferguson? - Joan! Joan, are you feeling up today.<eos> Joan, can we get a comment, please?<eos> Have you anything to say at all, Ms Ferguson?
His life insurance?<eos> Why would I...<eos> Is Andrew all right?<eos> Oh, Dr. Ryan, I-I'm so sorry.<eos> I'm reaching out to you to pay off his life insurance.
- Thank you.<eos> Did you already...?<eos> Not yet.<eos> There's never an excuse for being in a love hotel.<eos> You husband will use this evidence to get a good divorce settlement, so he doesn't have to pay you alimony.
If she had left word, it would not have been a vanishing, would it?<eos> Now, please, I must leave. Or there will be no work when I return.<eos> I will starve, and that will be on your conscience, Inspector.<eos> Uh-uh-uh, no, miss. You will not talk to me of conscience.<eos> That girl down there looked to you for leading.
It had to be Graff.<eos> Or else you're partly responsible for having hidden the truth from your son.<eos> But I'm not going to ask you to take my word for it.<eos> I'm gonna let you check for yourself.<eos> I'm going to invent a letter, a message from beyond the grave to you from your son, and I'm going to tell you what Dwight would have said about what happened, and let you run it by his dad.
The truth is.<eos> It is my nature to consider all the existing options.<eos> Thank you. Come on, let's go.<eos> Haryu San? What do you think?<eos> Do you sense an evil spirit?
So please just give me a call, 'just let me know you're all right 'and...<eos> let me know she's all right, please.<eos> This is it.<eos> You want to go inside?<eos> Mr Payne's here for you, ma'am.
- Yeah.<eos> Is he talking yet?<eos> Only to Carisi, and he's in and out of consciousness.<eos> He did indicate the plan was to cross the border at the Saint Lawrence River.<eos> Lieutenant, I'm glad you're here.
Chambers, take Decker's place.<eos> - Chambers!<eos> - Chambers!<eos> Where you running to, recruit?<eos> You don't want to miss the rest of the Captain's lecture, do you?
Murdered man ends up in a pit of deadly snakes?<eos> ! Now, that... That is a case worth investigating.<eos> Hey. Well, hello, Captain.<eos> I'm glad you're alone.<eos> I've been meaning to say how proud I am of you.
That said,<eos> - you might lose your ear.<eos> - What?<eos> !<eos> You...
I need you to get this to him.<eos> Between the guilds and merchants that lent land from him he has influence over 8 to 10 votes.<eos> - Enough to win?<eos> - It could be.<eos> Madonna, you must go.
Come. Join us.<eos> Messer Contarini, I believe you're acquainted - with Contessina de' Medici.<eos> - Of course.<eos> Though when I knew her she was Contessina de' Bardi.<eos> You and my brother were always thick as thieves.
The network keeps crashing.<eos> Turn around.<eos> We're gonna go to St. Anne's in Virginia.<eos> Negative, ma'am.<eos> We're under strict protocol to get you to the White House bunker.
Which, for all we know, are already here.<eos> At least tell me<eos> - we have some targeting data.<eos> - No, sir. Not yet.<eos> Madam Secretary, I have Blake Moran for you.
We're gonna go home as a family.<eos> While your father's still breathing.<eos> Besides, don't you want to see<eos> - if he glows in the dark?<eos> - Ma'am, uh, I have Jay for you.
He did?<eos> That seems out of character.<eos> What was the topic of conversation?<eos> You.<eos> You and Belikov.
Ah, the complicated Miss Skerrett.<eos> Are you now a... er... laundry maid as well as a dresser?<eos> The laundry maid has sprained her ankle, so I thought I'd take these down myself.<eos> When are you going to smile on me, Miss Skerrett?<eos> If you come down to the kitchen, I've made some sweet meats, just for you.
I thought I should like to understand what my mother sees in you.<eos> Well, I believe she values my company.<eos> She's long been a widow, and as you know, as your mother, she's in no position to remarry.<eos> - I see.<eos> - Different for you.
It is a-a-a favoured occupation of the people.<eos> Well, it seems to be the case that many artefacts are created en masse in the factories.<eos> I would very much like to visit some of these places.<eos> We hunt, ma'am.<eos> In fact, I've arranged for you and the Prince to ride out with the Shifnal tomorrow.
Well, if none of us has the moral courage to stand up to Peel,<eos> I... I suggest we back him.<eos> Is that understood?<eos> The frog is here.<eos> Wishing to croak at you.
I thought if all the people that bought this book and actually read it, I'm gonna be out of a job.<eos> There I was, out of luck.<eos> He came in about four seconds.<eos> 17-year-old boys not being known for their endurance.<eos> So you didn't achieve orgasm?
- Then could you advise me on the best way to return the tablet to the company?<eos> It's not the Foil, ma'am.<eos> The Foil will be released in time for back-to-school sales.<eos> - So I can keep it?<eos> - Whatever you have, you can keep.
- What? Do you know why I asked you to remove your headphones?<eos> Why are you talking so loud?<eos> Do you have a cranberry stuck in your ear again?<eos> - Winston found his cop voice.<eos> - Oh... Ma'am! Why are you avoiding an audition when you know damn well it's important to you?
How was your interaction with Anna?<eos> We had some spirited discussions.<eos> - More like all-out brawls.<eos> - Hold on.<eos> You and Anna argued two days before she was killed.
Our two civilian consultants have been granted TS/SCI clearance to take part.<eos> Please break the seal on your briefing materials now.<eos> On the inside, you will find a photo of Massoud Tahan.<eos> He is an ISIS recruiter in Syria.<eos> Mrs. Florrick, do you need help?
Well, the reasons are confidential, Mrs. Florrick.<eos> We really need to move on.<eos> No.<eos> I'm sorry, but I would like to know why Captain Hicks isn't here, and I don't think I'm the only one.<eos> Actually, I think you are.
As have the agents waiting with you.<eos> I want to speak to my daughter.<eos> You're not in a position to make demands.<eos> Rest assured Megan is fine.<eos> Whether she stays that way is up to you.
Why so soon?<eos> It hasn't been 24 hours.<eos> Someone's moving up the timeline.<eos> Yes?<eos> Do you have the money?
That's why he's holding on to SECNAV's daughter.<eos> He wants revenge.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'll leave you for a moment.
Let them come.<eos> Gwen, it's you.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> - Just a little something, ma'am. - A little something of what?<eos> For you and Mr Appleby, to help you get with child.
No!<eos> Have you seen him?<eos> No, ma'am.<eos> You should leave Shepzoy now, ma'am.<eos> It would be best, for you and the baby, to get far, far away from here.
Have you seen him?<eos> No, ma'am.<eos> You should leave Shepzoy now, ma'am.<eos> It would be best, for you and the baby, to get far, far away from here.<eos> It's not good for you here.
- I am. - But first, um, tell us a little about yourself.<eos> - Let's start with your childhood.<eos> - Your Honor, uh... relevance?<eos> Oh, I think the relevance... will become clear.<eos> I'll give you a little leeway.
So...<eos> The flight is nine hours, but it is totally worth it.<eos> They have the most beautiful beaches just outside of Reykjavik.<eos> So you mean to tell me you don't miss it?<eos> - Ma'am, a package for you.
I could only feel me.<eos> You want to make me half of who I am.<eos> I want you to live.<eos> This is who nature intended us to be.<eos> It isn't natural to you, but what you are isn't natural to us.
You have any family in the waiting area?<eos> No.<eos> No, I'm a... I'm a single mom.<eos> I di... I didn't have anyone to ask.<eos> We can hold him for you.
That's so cute.<eos> No, hello?<eos> It's not a joke, ma'am.<eos> I'm not sure I was clear.<eos> You ex-husband is...
Smile.<eos> That's...<eos> Okay. I got it, Mike.<eos> I'll be fine.<eos> Can I hear it from you just once?
His name's Ian Gendry, he left this in his motel room.<eos> No need to thank us, it's what geniuses do.<eos> How are you even here right now?<eos> Guy left a message on my voice-mail, we tracked the call here.<eos> He called you?
Which is in my district.<eos> So your narcotics case is now mine. Okay, sweetheart?<eos> The 2nd precinct is perfectly capable of handling the narcotics case, as well as the murder case connected to those narcotics.<eos> - Enough.<eos> - Captain, if you can't handle your detective, the IAB can come in here and deal with this precinct.
- It's Sunday.<eos> - I know.<eos> This is Mike Tascioni.<eos> And this is Tom.<eos> Do you have a little water?
They're not clean and pure.<eos> No one is suggesting Governor Florrick is pure.<eos> I did my due diligence before joining.<eos> That wasn't surprising.<eos> Perhaps not to you.
Might have acquired a quick infusion of cash.<eos> He did.<eos> And did Lloyd Garber provide that money?<eos> He bundled it for us, yes.<eos> And you had struggles with Eli Gold, too, didn't you?
- Someone you know well.<eos> Sheriff Alex Romero.<eos> Now, it would be really unfortunate for you to go to jail and for him to go free, wouldn't it?<eos> It's your choice.<eos> Everything that happens here is gonna be completely up to you.
I'm with the FBI.<eos> There are two boys missing in Virginia.<eos> Adam Morrissey and Jimmy Bennett.<eos> Do you know anything about them?<eos> A box with some of their clothes was delivered here addressed to you.
Red tabs for initials, blue tabs for signatures.<eos> Every part of a trauma tells a different piece of the story.<eos> This is one of the simpler divorces I've seen, actually.<eos> And until you look at each and every injury...<eos> So, what are you gonna do?
Sorry, Chef.<eos> -Got those mushrooms?<eos> -I'm sorry, I forgot.<eos> -Grab some caviar while you're at it. -Yes, Chef.<eos> I always set this table aside for you.
They're covering their tracks.<eos> At least we know she's got Internet.<eos> I'll run this through a translator.<eos> "My dear Miss Ayyad:<eos> "It is strange to hear from you, "like a message from another lifetime.
I haven't done anythingwrong.<eos> She done it to herself.<eos> Why can't you just leave us alone!<eos> Oh, my God! I'm so sorry.<eos> I didn't mean to hurt you, honestly,I was just trying to get past.
Sometimes, I suppose.<eos> He would have known your husband's hobby. Bird-watching.<eos> Most people did.<eos> So he knew your husband was often away.<eos> And it seems likely he bore a grudge against you, that he blamed you for what happened to him.
I know exactly where I am!<eos> Mrs Herz...<eos> I didn't come here to harm you.<eos> My name is Julien Baptiste.<eos> I need to ask you some questions.
But it's hard to really know.<eos> - Hello?<eos> - This is Mrs. Hathaway.<eos> Oh, hi.<eos> I have a message for you.
Your one condition is to have a full examination within the next 10 days.<eos> - That's right.<eos> - Until that happens and we fix the problem, no more medication from me, Spencer.<eos> Yeah, no, I got it.<eos> No more from you, 10 days, we're gonna fix the problem.
Infuriating woman!<eos> How is your friend Dr Enys?<eos> Wedded to his work, ma'am... with no time for distractions.<eos> Would you count me a distraction?<eos> I shouldn't presume to connect you with Dr Enys in any way, but I'm sure he'll wish you well on the occasion of your engagement!
He was curious about my marriage intentions.<eos> - Do you have any?<eos> - No immediate ones.<eos> You see, Mr Gresham, I would rather be courted as a woman than a bank account.<eos> I don't blame you.
Oh, may we..?<eos> Better you than me.<eos> - Gerry is really dead?<eos> - I'm afraid he is.<eos> We can arrange for his body to be sent back to you from Toronto.
Please, let me go!<eos> I'm Constable George Crabtree.<eos> I'm here to help you.<eos> Let me just get my coat.<eos> Miss Hall if you just take a seat here, Detective Murdoch will be right with you.
You'd love us to believe that, wouldn't you?<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> You wanted revenge.<eos> You knew Todd needed money, so after finding out your boss had a new Ferrari, you decided to help Todd steal it.<eos> He was giving you your cut when he came to see you, only Major Hamilton found out and got his own revenge later that night and that's the reason you haven't come forward.
Here's a question.<eos> Five years ago when we started at the DPP, you, me, Erin, Tatum, Ben, all standing next to each other, where did you see yourself in five years time?<eos> Actually, I thought I'd get a few years experience, then take the bar exam and start building my own career.<eos> So what happened?<eos> What you've described isn't remembering the incident, but reliving it, which is a classic indicator of post-traumatic stress.
I can neither confirm nor deny.<eos> Well, I can.<eos> Actually, you can't!<eos> You swore confidentiality on that panel.<eos> You shouldn't even be telling me about it.
She's spent countless nights at our house.<eos> Bobby was the divorce lawyer for her parents. Why?<eos> What does this have to do with Brie Miller?<eos> Please stay where you are, Mrs. Cushing. Someone will...<eos> someone will join you shortly. One second.
If that's true, the bags could have been switched.<eos> Oh, my God, you're gonna think that I... oh, my God.<eos> Just calm down, calm down.<eos> Take a deep breath, and we'll go through this together.<eos> Including you, how many others would you say have the combination to that safe?
Sorry to upset you, and I... I didn't pick you specifically.<eos> I looked for every Jennifer, Jen, Jenny Edwards or Edwards as a maiden name on Linkedin, Twitter, Facebook.<eos> Well, I'm the lucky winner, then.<eos> What did Gene say to you about me?<eos> Gene is using you as an alibi.
And I am telling you that God holds you more dearly for seeking penance where none is required.<eos> So who else do you need absolution from?<eos> Ms. Darnell.<eos> Thank you for coming back.<eos> I am aware that this is a difficult time for you.
Thanks for coming out.<eos> How could I say no to toasting success?<eos> Listen, I know things got heated in my office, but it's the end result that matters.<eos> GRU's Intel was vital to finding the last of the bombs.<eos> Can I get you anything, Madam Secretary?
- but I haven't. - Nobody has, which is why it's too much of a coincidence to be... coincidence.<eos> Okay, I'll have someone look into the story.<eos> Great.<eos> I can't find anything in writing, and the Mallon Hospital won't let me anywhere near their archives.<eos> So you thought you'd come to us and we'd look in the archives for you?
- Well, no, that's not what I meant.<eos> Agent Davies, uh, could you fire up that projector for me, please?<eos> What are you doing? Well, this place is crawling with cameras.<eos> You didn't... [Whirring] You didn't think that they missed the bathroom, too, did you?<eos> I don't believe you.
Maybe you know him as Big Yao, or not-so-Big Yao, thanks to you.<eos> You need to stop lying.<eos> Doctor/patient confidentiality.<eos> - Mm-hmm. How about you explain how fat from Big Yao and three more of your patients got synthesized into the bomb that killed a young man?<eos> I have before and after pictures, since that's something you're more familiar with.
- The worst is over now.<eos> - Oh, I doubt that.<eos> I would like to speak to him.<eos> My son just came out of a coma.<eos> I am not about to let you accuse him of murder.
Yeah, you're not moving back in any time soon.<eos> So, it's as bad as it looks?<eos> It's actually worse than it looks.<eos> Infested with mold.<eos> Do you think I'll still be able to get married here in six weeks?
Thank you.<eos> You're wondering why you're here.<eos> I am.<eos> We've decided to transition you into a research position this year and have a new professor teach Introduction to Criminal Law.<eos> I wanted you to hear it directly from me, as I know how important that class is to you.
You're wondering why you're here.<eos> I am.<eos> We've decided to transition you into a research position this year and have a new professor teach Introduction to Criminal Law.<eos> I wanted you to hear it directly from me, as I know how important that class is to you.<eos> We simply think it's the best decision for you and the university.
Fingers crossed.<eos> Thank you, Mrs. Sutter.<eos> How are your cards tonight?<eos> I hope you have better luck on your test.<eos> I'll come by and check on you a little later.
She said someone probably did it.<eos> Did you, now?<eos> Well, I just couldn't see Milly risking the children finding her like that.<eos> It makes sense if you think about it.<eos> You're a real Miss Marple, aren't you?
Yeah.<eos> I shouldn't have said that.<eos> I got to check on a patient.<eos> Miss Martinez, I owe you an apology.<eos> I had no right to talk to you like that.
Captain Alister, your tour is over.<eos> Sir, I have three months left on my tour.<eos> You had three months.<eos> You'll be stateside next week.<eos> As for you, major. With the captain gone, we're grossly understaffed.
- You okay?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I live here! Please!<eos> Who is it? Tell me!<eos> You're in shock right now. I understand that. Unfortunately, we do need to get as much information from you right now as possible.
I'm here. Just don't worry.<eos> I know. I'm on it.<eos> Please try to trust me.<eos> Laurel's pregnant.<eos> We're happy to plan whatever you like.
So how'd you find out about it?<eos> Call it mother's intuition.<eos> Or did you find out by snooping into her secret e-mail?<eos> - Excuse me. - Ms. Keating...<eos> You require your employees to lock their cellphones in your desk while they're working, correct?
- Excuse me. - Ms. Keating...<eos> You require your employees to lock their cellphones in your desk while they're working, correct?<eos> - You don't have to answer that.<eos> - It's company policy.<eos> A policy that allowed you to read Karen's e-mail about poisoning you, which is why you decided to poison yourself.
But her killer drove a car full of evidence all the way to Bridgeport.<eos> And the only reason to do that was to make sure that that car was processed at the Connecticut forensics lab-- your lab-- where you could implicate whoever you wanted.<eos> Phoebe's brother was the lowest hanging fruit.<eos> You said yourself good police work usually reveals the killer.<eos> In this case, you have means and motive.
If ex-lab supervisor Zoe Mercado or anyone of her ilk had performed those tests, they would have rightly come back a match.<eos> But in this case, we didn't inform the lab which DNA belonged to our suspect.<eos> We provided several samples from your home, samples from other suspects, like Keith Elliot, Ephraim Hill.<eos> Even threw in a sample from my tortoise just to keep them on their toes.<eos> And imagine our surprise when the lab revealed that the DNA in the car didn't belong to your wife, it belonged to you.
I thought it was a wrong number, but this morning, the same guy called back, saying he received the money, and the condo was all lined up.<eos> The condo.<eos> Where Butch was running away to.<eos> He was leaving me.<eos> You think he bought property in Tahiti under an assumed name and was gonna move there without you?
But I never said anything like... - Mr. Deepak! Minal, the honorable Judge is saying that you'll get a chance to defend yourself.<eos> Just sit down and be quiet!<eos> Would you like to cross-examine him?<eos> - No, cross your honor. Minal Arora, please take the stand.<eos> The charges against you are quiet serious Do you have anything to say?
Friend. Friend or more than a friend?<eos> That's personal - Huh!<eos> It is a personal matter - I see.<eos> It's a personal matter.<eos> So your 'friend', he is older than you, divorced and he also has a child
Uh, for opening that door... that was me.<eos> - I guess it was an accident. - It wasn't.<eos> Okay, well, don't do it again.<eos> - I probably will.<eos> - If you're gonna do it again, I'm gonna have to give you a ticket.
I'll give it my best shot.<eos> At least I can tell my mother I've danced with a Wing Commander.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come in.<eos> Mrs Harden, Mr Lakin for you.
Or "food."<eos> Or "pork." Yes.<eos> But, as Jessica explained to me, albeit in language more befitting a political strategist, it's an opportunity to do some glad-handing with the Virginia locals.<eos> Yeah, just to kick things off in a fun way.<eos> Of course, we have a number of savvy public profile boosts coming up for you and your family.
May I remind you that our country was the spark that lit the Arab Spring in 2011, and years later we're the only Arab country that emerged with a functioning democracy.<eos> We have no sectarian divisions, a history of moderate Islam, widespread literacy, and a small army loyal to a civilian government.<eos> We're the best hope in the Muslim world and you know it, Madam Secretary.<eos> And I assure you that everyone in the president's administration is aware of that.<eos> So, I'd like to believe the only reason I'm reduced to following you to the elevator to achieve a full 15 minutes of your time is not because we lack oil or other resources for the United States to exploit.
Can you tell me what happened yesterday in the ambulance?<eos> Have you seen the body? No.<eos> Photos.<eos> His head just exploded.<eos> Did you hear a gunshot?
I'm on your side, remember?<eos> The other night, these men break into our house.<eos> Wave guns in our faces. Put hoods over our heads.<eos> I thought we were dead.<eos> You and your husband?
I've come wearing two hats.<eos> I'm a little busy...<eos> Hat number one.<eos> I would like to re-register with Dr Campbell.<eos> Is that you and Mr Cameron?
Then help us.<eos> You'll be helping yourself, too.<eos> Two of the six psychopaths we already know about.<eos> The other four we're working on identifying off their IP addresses.<eos> What we need from you is the name of the person you are sending information to.
Hey! - Shut up!<eos> - This is meant to be a happy thing.<eos> - Yeah, guys, we gotta work together to make it happen, yeah?<eos> Well, how am I gonna get a syringe?<eos> Jenkins for you.
Yeah, I know, you can't make this stuff up, huh?<eos> Hey! Yeah.<eos> Thank you for getting her to say yes.<eos> Of course, man. Hey, hey.<eos> Is there anything that I could do for you?
Yeah, I can't deliver this baby premature, this is not my baby.<eos> I'm a surrogate.<eos> I'm carrying this baby for someone else.<eos> I need to carry it to term or I don't get paid.<eos> If we don't deliver now, this condition could be fatal for both you and the baby.
Yeah, I know.<eos> And from her baby...<eos> Nice clear voice and smile.<eos> To her babysitting job.<eos> Is there anything else I be getting for you?
I'm Sofia's mother. I legally adopted her.<eos> She doesn't want to go there.<eos> No, she doesn't.<eos> Her last names are Sloan and Torres.<eos> I'm gonna have to stop you before you continue for your own sake.
Why am I brought here?<eos> Because she asks, and she has a way of getting what she asks for.<eos> You bank a great deal on my discretion, Miss Susan.<eos> I hope you will consider it a risk worth taking.<eos> And what is that I may do for you?
Of course. Come on, Noah.<eos> We'll go in two by two.<eos> I won't leave without saying goodbye.<eos> - Shall I take his case'? - Oh, yes, thank you.<eos> I know this isn't easy for you, Mrs Barden.
Yes.<eos> Shot dead the day before yesterday by the Japanese.<eos> So is there anyone living whose name you can give us?<eos> If there was anyone else I could identify, I would.<eos> What about the man who shot at you when you escaped from that car?
No, sir.<eos> For a woman your age seeking asylum, the ability to bear children is a factor.<eos> You're wrong, Miss Crain.<eos> We do owe you.<eos> We're not going to send you back to face the Kempeitai or the Resistance.
Which is why, from now on, your name will be Julia Mills from Seattle.<eos> You'll be given new identity papers, a personal history to memorize.<eos> Okay.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> You'll be given accommodation, and an allowance until your application for permanent citizenship's granted.
He wasn't slurring his words or anything.<eos> But his eyes and breath gave it away.<eos> You expecting a call?<eos> No.<eos> Well, you're getting one. Yeah.
It's the same thing. Traditional banking, digital currency.<eos> That train is leaving the station my friends, so you either jump on-board or get left behind.<eos> Well, very intriguing.<eos> We're going to chat internally.<eos> Yeah? And we will circle back with you.
I don't usually talk to people.<eos> There's just, um, something about you. No, no, please.<eos> There's...<eos> There's no need to apologize.<eos> You ju...
Don't have study hall the same time as your friends?<eos> I want to drop out of school.<eos> Only have two years left.<eos> Why not finish?<eos> Then we can talk about finding you a job...
A wife?<eos> No. Got a kid. He's with her.<eos> Well, I'll sleep sounder knowing you're back amongst us.<eos> I hope so, ma'am.<eos> You, a killer.
The Romans did that.<eos> Not the Jews?<eos> - (TELEPHONE RINGING)<eos> Oh. Reverend Green sure got it wrong, then.<eos> Telephone for you.
(CHUCKLES) I had no cause to like him.<eos> Any to get rid of him?<eos> Now, listen here, Sergeant...<eos> No one goes missing without a reason.<eos> And people are unlucky around you.
Uh, it might be best if I see her alone.<eos> Righto.<eos> Sister Adams?<eos> Sorry. Sister Nordmann. I forgot.<eos> Don't tell me they're on at you, too.
I do.<eos> (VEHICLE PASSING) You know, recently I have had cause to reflect on times in my life when people have not been honest with me.<eos> Oh, I'm very sorry to hear that.<eos> They assumed, incorrectly, that I had not been strong enough to bear the truth.<eos> You, of all people.
How young are we now?<eos> Um, I'm 38.<eos> - You look great. - Thank you.<eos> You both look great.<eos> I wouldn't really do anything on you.
They can't turn it around.<eos> What? This table is amazingly gorgeous.<eos> It's not shabby chic.<eos> What even is that?<eos> I can get rid of it for you. Do you want me to?
A Ukranian journalist by the name of Karlina Ordenko has gone missing.<eos> I need to talk to her.<eos> I'd be very grateful if you could make some discreet inquiries.<eos> I'm afraid I cannot help you.<eos> The FBI is already aware of a number of potentially illegal operations with ties to you.
What is this about?<eos> My daughter?<eos> - No, no, no, no, no. - No, no, no.<eos> It's nothing like that at all.<eos> Sorry. We didn't mean to alarm you.
We're so close, then they'll all fall.<eos> I thought something, Don Pietro...<eos> What?<eos> With your permission, I'd like to see if it works or not.<eos> Try this, it looks made for you.
Yeah, that coward needs to take responsibility.<eos> I don't care about myself, but my son... [sighs]<eos> My son is paying for what he and his company did to me.<eos> I'm sorry. Uh...<eos> This must be so hard for you and your husband.
This must be so hard for you and your husband.<eos> Is he around?<eos> May I speak with him?<eos> Jonathan's on vacation.<eos> Without you?
The principal asked to speak with you.<eos> Now?<eos> - Yeah. - Okay.<eos> Mr. Dobbs, would you keep an eye on these two for me?<eos> If I could tear my eyes off you.
Hmm. I need to dive.<eos> Everything is changing so fast.<eos> I do not do well with change.<eos> Gosh, Ms. Grant.<eos> I really can't imagine being here without you.
John.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hello, Julia.<eos> And what are those?<eos> These are for you.
Shelby, I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Matt!<eos> Cuff her.<eos> Lee. Hey.<eos> Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. Matt?
I don't get it.<eos> So the bank will give out loans to people who usually will make money back to pay it back.<eos> I'll just get another loan and I'll pay you back.<eos> No, but how is the bank going to trust you?<eos> I give you my word, it's me, I tell you.
Listen, at the end of the day, those are just slogans.<eos> It's not really real.<eos> Well, let's make this real.<eos> What if I was a potato farmer?<eos> And I come to you and I say, "hey I want to plant tomatoes."
Hey, I'm Ryan Mills, and I really appreciate the opportunity.<eos> - Your son?<eos> - Ryan's your man.<eos> Sure, he might've spent the last few years tooling around Europe trying to find himself, but he's back and ready to work.<eos> Is there anything I can do for you?
I thought, anyway.<eos> What are you doing, Alicia?<eos> My apologies.<eos> I've been running a little behind today.<eos> You must be Alicia. Hi.
She's brilliant, no one questions that, they both are.<eos> But intelligence and wisdom are not the same thing.<eos> I don't care how many sims they've done, they don't know Mars.<eos> I'm worried, Joon.<eos> Mr. Ed Grann is here to see you.
Are you all right? Yes.<eos> Of course, I'm fine.<eos> I suppose you must've seen a lot of that sort of thing.<eos> The Japs are very lax with their racial laws, so I hear. - Well...<eos> - I don't blame you for staying single, Miss Mills.
Right.<eos> Mrs. Bolad?<eos> I'm... I'm Detective Erin Lindsay.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> You have no idea what Tariq went through to get to this country...
And I've been a party loyalist for over 40 years, and I intend to die one.<eos> Dalton running as an independent is the biggest case of traitorism I've ever seen, and I simply won't be a part of it.<eos> Your job as a foreign service officer is apolitical.<eos> It's unethical for you to let politics unravel a vital deal that you brokered on behalf of the...<eos> You're damn right I did, no thanks to you!
You should have called your doctor.<eos> Well, I certainly know better now.<eos> I won't let it happen again.<eos> There's one other thing.<eos> I was reviewing your labs, and some of the numbers indicate that you haven't been eating as well as you should.
Mrs. Barlow?<eos> I'm Dr. Charles.<eos> How are we doing today?<eos> Pleased to meet you, Dr. Charles.<eos> Dr. Choi mentioned that you were having some trouble with your medication, and he asked me to look in on you.
Now you may 9°-<eos> He is very obedient. Hmm.<eos> This is part of it.<eos> To disobey is to say something, so... so he obeys.<eos> He isn't trying to hurt you.
- I might be able to help you.<eos> - Yes, of course.<eos> It's pig meat.<eos> I'll bring more when I can.<eos> I can get you out.
Hello.<eos> It's almost bearable today.<eos> Herr Heck, Miss.<eos> What a surprise.<eos> I wasn't expecting you today.
Now, I will check your pulse.<eos> Thank you, Doctor.<eos> - Pietrasia, do you mind?<eos> - No, no, no. I'm sorry, Doctor.<eos> I didn't see you come in.
"Put your drive at the top of the list and you become an unstoppable force."<eos> - Not bad.<eos> - Your words really hit home with me.<eos> Keep watching, kid.<eos> Sir, any chance a hard working guy who's ready to put the job first could catch a break and come work for you?
What gave you such drive?<eos> So, what happens now?<eos> You know what happens now.<eos> You're quickly becoming a legend.<eos> Someone here to see you. Mmm-hmm.
Go on, go. I need to sleep.<eos> I don't feel good.<eos> El rancho?<eos> Hang on a second.<eos> It's for you.
Over.<eos> Tell him we'll be there within the hour.<eos> Mr. Phillips, go get your kids.<eos> Mr. Phillips, there isn't one person in this room who doesn't care about your Missy.<eos> We're doing everything in our power to bring her back safely to you.
- Let them do their job. Okay? - Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Mr. Riley.<eos> - Don't go too far.<eos> They're expecting you at the base in an hour.
Well, he talked about you.<eos> A lot.<eos> I pushed him around.<eos> I didn't kill him, though.<eos> I don't recognize you.
Hello, darling!<eos> The word is, you have a sweetheart, Mr. Wentworth.<eos> How do you know?<eos> Detective Miller. He works for me on the side.<eos> I thought Styvesan worked for you.
Yeah, sorry. Sir, sir?<eos> I'm sorry, got to go. Got to go.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'll have those votes by the morning.<eos> Okay, and Kate, Kate sends her best, her love... to you and Sabina.
What do you think I am? A kid can't throw that strong.<eos> Why would I want to break your window? How the fuck would I know?<eos> Dude.<eos> Just tell me the truth.<eos> I came here to pay for your lame-ass window, not to hear you talk.
What you need is rest, and treatment.<eos> You need to check yourself in somewhere.<eos> - I'll be fine.<eos> - No, you're not!<eos> I mean, I know that you're different... but that doesn't change the fact that something inside you is poisoning you.
- Stop!<eos> Not on my watch!<eos> You guys are not allowed to leave campus.<eos> You need the proper paperwork to leave!<eos> I make more money than you!
MacBook Pro.<eos> I'm sorry, what?<eos> I'll do it for a MacBook Pro.<eos> Are you trying to blackmail me?<eos> Want me to lie for you or not?
Oh, thank you, Mrs. Connover.<eos> ALI: Hello!<eos> - Hi, Humphrey, hi, hello.<eos> - (BARKING)<eos> I'm gonna pet you later 'cause I need coffee desperately.
Here, come sit here.<eos> We thought we were alone.<eos> So... There is no one else.<eos> You found no one.<eos> Just you.
Go have some fun.<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> Tip-top.<eos> Colonel Packard!<eos> There's a phone call for you.
Yeah, it was mine, from a long time ago.<eos> Hello?<eos> Ward 73.<eos> Oh, er, Dr Watson?<eos> It's for you.
It's good to see you, too, Sheriff Truman.<eos> As you know, your brother, Harry S. Truman, is my godfather.<eos> I heard he is ill.<eos> I came to pay my respects to my godfather and extend my best wishes for his recovery, which I hope will be swift and painless.<eos> It's an honor to see you again.
And you're here to see Harold Meachum?<eos> Yeah.<eos> please. - Okay.<eos> I used to ride my skateboard around in here.<eos> Someone will be right out to see you. thanks.
What kind of trade?<eos> If you sign these... then... I will leave you this.<eos> - $50,000?<eos> - You could do a lot with that.<eos> This must be very important to you.
I'm just tired.<eos> What do you think?<eos> It's better than torture.<eos> Hey! What's your problem?<eos> I'm talking to you.
Looks like all of your paper-pushing worked.<eos> Uncuff the superstar.<eos> Get him out of my sight.<eos> My bad.<eos> These belong to you.
Your Honor, unless Mr. Murdock can prove my client actually received these hypothetical documents, then...<eos> It's not about whether he received them. It's whether he willfully ignored them.<eos> Your Honor, I ask that this record of delivery be admitted into evidence.<eos> - I mean, I get a lot of those.<eos> - What would you say is worse?
What are you doing?<eos> Whoa! She is very strong.<eos> Sir, this is for your protection. We need this place to look closed.<eos> It is closed!<eos> We have no intention of hurting you.
Good morning, Mr. Hyde.<eos> Ana, please, it's Jack.<eos> Tea, right?<eos> Weak, black.<eos> I'm pretty sure I'm supposed to get this for you, but thank you, Jack.
We stand against you and your... witch.<eos> Ludendorff, enough!<eos> 24 hours from now... this war will end.<eos> It is over.<eos> It's over for you.
Mr. melnyk?<eos> Mr. melnyk?<eos> My name is Tessa corbett, I'm a journalist.<eos> I know you're in there.<eos> I don't want to bother you, I just came 'cause I wanted to share some of my articles with you.
Brace? I'm going out.<eos> I need to see someone.<eos> From Mr Delaney.<eos> Mr Cholmondeley! Mr Cholmondeley! Mr Cholmondeley!<eos> I have a message for you, sir, from Mr Delaney.
What are you to him?<eos> I'm Mrs Delaney.<eos> His wife. No.<eos> His mother.<eos> This just arrived for you, sir.
- And...<eos> What is your...<eos> All lost. Drowned.<eos> And what is your interest in the sinking?<eos> Did you have relatives aboard?
For nine years, you have been campaigning for a Royal Commission to investigate the drowning of these 280 slaves, which you say was done deliberately.<eos> It is my belief that some very powerful men in London were involved in an illicit shipment of slaves for personal profit, were complicit in the deaths of those slaves and in the subsequent concealment of the facts.<eos> And you believe that those men are senior directors within the Honourable East India Company?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> Well then, Mr. Chichester, I have some good news for you.
The silver tooth is mine.<eos> Who has a blade for the dentistry?<eos> Relax, Mr. Delaney.<eos> You're in safe hands.<eos> Your devil saved you.
So just tell me what you want to say to Carlsbad, and I'll stitch you up and set you loose.<eos> Interesting knife they used to carve you up.<eos> Is that Chinese, you think? Or Malay?<eos> When you came in here with bits of a man's flesh between your teeth... we kind of had a silent deal.<eos> I stitch you up and you give me information.
Then I will visit you in your dreams, my love.<eos> Please.<eos> I'm your sister.<eos> Let all else lie.<eos> There is a woman here to see you and I swear the only way
- Mrs. Delaney!<eos> Miss Bow, do you know why there are boards on the windows of this house?<eos> So the fortunate people outside can't see inside of the state of this place, I imagine.<eos> No, because there are wicked men out there who would wish me dead.<eos> However, neither the East India or the King will kill you because of your will.
I was told the details of your situation by a representative of his Majesty The King, George.<eos> And indirectly it was the King who financed the drawing up of that very expensive piece of paper, which you just burnt.<eos> As a rule, the King's council very rarely makes business with an actress unless it's up the back alley of Maiden Lane.<eos> The piece of paper you just burnt also states that, as Horace Delaney's widow,<eos> I also own half the trading post at Nootka Sound and I believe Nootka is of value to you and to the King.
Uh, I just thought you should know this. Uh, it's gonna sound strange.<eos> Something's been found, something Deputy Chief Hawk found.<eos> Missing pages from a certain Laura Palmer's diary that could indicate two Coopers.<eos> I don't know any more than this, but, uh, I-I just thought you should know it.<eos> Uh, maybe it means something to you.
Which he'd kind of need to be, if he was to corral this 43-nation coalition of the willing.<eos> - May I help you?<eos> - No, finish your phone call.<eos> The war can wait.<eos> What can I do for you, General?
And I also have a job to do.<eos> And I am trying to do mine.<eos> As an elected representative of the people of Germany, it is my job to ensure that the personal ambitions of those who serve those people are kept in check.<eos> You have devoted your entire life, General, to the fighting of war.<eos> And this situation in Afghanistan, for you, it is the culmination of all your years of training, all your years of ambition.
You.<eos> How long have you been saving that?<eos> A few miles.<eos> I think I'll meet Glinda at the foot of the Eternal Warrior. Show of strength.<eos> But meeting her halfway... shouldn't you make her come to you?
Who is your father?<eos> I don't know.<eos> How do you know my name?<eos> My love.<eos> I don't know you, sir.
Of course not.<eos> Why was I invited here this evening?<eos> Is there some connection with the Shepherd Market murder?<eos> Let's just stay on track, shall we?<eos> We need nothing of you. Except loyalty to your country.
- When did they find him?<eos> - 22:47 hours.<eos> Foot patrols on the clock, every two hours.<eos> Not exactly making things difficult for The Partisans.<eos> This is an announcement that they intend to kill you unless you do as they say.
No feelers yet?<eos> Nobody asked you any subtle questions about how you like working for the Huns?<eos> No.<eos> Curious.<eos> Since your reputation has grown I would have expected some whining and sniffing around you by now.
Kellermann!<eos> He'll be gone too.<eos> You don't know about his bank accounts in Zurich, all his bribes from the contractors building the new prisons.<eos> The only thing he cares about is saving his perfumed pink skin.<eos> For you, Superintendent.
Yeah.<eos> Not sure.<eos> It always takes me until Thanksgiving to start putting names to faces.<eos> Really?<eos> 'Cause he was supposed to do some sort of extra credit thing for you.
Shadow, we're going to be releasing you later this afternoon.<eos> Your wife-- ...she died in the early hours of this morning. Was a-- an automobile accident...<eos> Also, you lost something vital in there, not just time.<eos> If I was inclined, what might I call you?
Fifteen seconds.<eos> People trust you...<eos> for decades have valued you.<eos> I think that's because people value the truth.<eos> Right, but don't you think your discovery was just... too dangerous to share with the world?
Second bell.<eos> You're not that innocent, Jensen.<eos> I don't give a shit what she says.<eos> Mr. Foley, let's go. Get to homeroom.<eos> You too, Mr. Jensen.
Mind your own fucking business, you got it?<eos> I know.<eos> - What the fuck is his problem?<eos> Mr. Baker.<eos> Okay, uh... what can I do for you?
Are you serious?<eos> She talks about drowning with stones tied to her feet.<eos> She talks about being lost for good.<eos> Mr. Baker... a lot of teens talk about being lost.<eos> Well, God help them if they come to you.
It would help if Nassau knew I was coming.<eos> Can you see to it?<eos> Of course.<eos> I don't make this request lightly.<eos> But after everything Max has done for the council, for you, it seems like a moment when she's owed something back.
Oh! What the shit?<eos> My car! Look what that animal did to my car!<eos> Madeline, call my wife, will ya?<eos> Madeline?<eos> I'm sorry. I didn't realize Mr. Stussy was expecting you.
Oh, um, you know, it's...<eos> I thought I would be here maybe a week or two, you know. And the motel's getting pretty expensive.<eos> Relax, kid. I got you covered, totally.<eos> Just make sure you keep all your receipts.<eos> Mr. Beatty for you, sir.
_<eos> _<eos> I had a few questions for you about a writer you worked with back in 1975. Thaddeus Mobley.<eos> _<eos> He wrote a script for you called The Planet Wyh, a science fiction film?
I had a few questions for you about a writer you worked with back in 1975. Thaddeus Mobley.<eos> _<eos> He wrote a script for you called The Planet Wyh, a science fiction film?<eos> And, well, he was the victim of some malfeasance recently, and I'm just trying to connect the dots here.<eos> I know he was writing a movie for you, and then, I don't know, something happened.
- Easy, baby. You'll get your chance.<eos> But first, we gotta know the play.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Right this way.<eos> Mr. Stussy, these ladies are here to see you.
A private one, and you're trespassing.<eos> What's your position here?<eos> Could I have your name?<eos> You wouldn't have lied your way in if you had any legal authority, like a warrant.<eos> The guards will escort you out.
Again, please.<eos> Reload.<eos> I beg your pardon, my Lord, but she demanded that I relay what follows... her words precisely... in spite of any protest you offered.<eos> She says she knows that you will be angry and that this will be hard for you to understand but she said...<eos> She said you should trust that her commitment to you remains inviolable... and that this is no betrayal... but an act of love.
We've already revoked Ms. Ingram's provisional status, and we're updating security passwords and codes that she may have been exposed to today.<eos> That's all well and good, but Rebecca Ingram's capture has ramifications beyond your passwords and codes.<eos> You are to do everything in your power to bring her in...<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I'll keep you apprised.
You told her not to come back down here, didn't you?<eos> You'll have plenty of time to murder her another day.<eos> Right now, you need to rest.<eos> You asked to see me, my Lord?<eos> I cannot imagine what sort of horror this is for you.
It is.<eos> And who are you?<eos> Her grandmother.<eos> Wait outside.<eos> I'll join you shortly.
All the modern amenities of a coffin.<eos> So, Miss Blue, if you and your laddie are not a pair of headhunters, putting on your show was a terrible risk.<eos> Care to explain what possessed you?<eos> Well, Mr. Hoy, if you're not a BPO headhunter, then leaving your coffin to come to my show was a terrible risk.<eos> - What possessed you?
Mr. Hoy said I have to go to Chicago.<eos> But I have to go alone.<eos> Nom!<eos> Dr. Metzger.<eos> I don't know what they taught you in med school, but the word "helping" doesn't mean handcuff people and chop up their brains.
We have to get to London.<eos> I'll explain everything.<eos> - We have to get to London.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> This is for you.
I bet you'd like the use of an office.<eos> I would.<eos> Follow me.<eos> Look at that.<eos> So you were warned.
He was convinced someone was making something on the side, demanded to see the accounts.<eos> - Did you give them to him?<eos> - No.<eos> I think he took them just before he disappeared.<eos> There you are. Just the man. I've been looking for you.
Well, what do you know?<eos> Tit for tat?<eos> All right.<eos> Ah, the old lady who died there yesterday used to work for a doctor's family out by Binsey.<eos> You show me yours.
It was a house of monsters.<eos> But the men who came to visit your father were heroes, as was he.<eos> The only monster in that house was you.<eos> I read your sister's diary.<eos> - She was terrified of you.
The only monster in that house was you.<eos> I read your sister's diary.<eos> - She was terrified of you.<eos> - I'd never hurt Penelope!<eos> The only way to get away ofyou was by drowning! She drowned herself to get away from you.
I'm looking at exactly what I want.<eos> You gonna dress up prostitutes to look like me too?<eos> You might have a hard time.<eos> I have a very specific look.<eos> Lieutenant, what hurts more, being in those chains or knowing who it was who put you there?
Good evening.<eos> Hello, there.<eos> Good evening.<eos> Well, it is now.<eos> What can I do for you, mister?
What are you doing? - Stop. - Get off me.<eos> Get off me! You can't do this.<eos> Stop. He will kill her.<eos> I must find Jane.<eos> Vanessa will be right with you.
That's what they called us.<eos> That's right.<eos> Soldiers of the Gauntlet.<eos> Right, well, Booth, now that we've verified the alibi, we should get going.<eos> It was an honor to meet you, sir.
The... the base is still there, right?<eos> The B-52 is, I presume, still...<eos> - B-29.<eos> - Huh? B-29. FIFI's a B-29.<eos> Oh, this is all just one big joke to you, huh?
You betcha.<eos> Bye, now.<eos> I am so sorry. Thank you for holding.<eos> How may I help you?<eos> Well, I can set you up with an appointment.
Thank you.<eos> That was very nice of you.<eos> No problem.<eos> It's my pleasure.<eos> Is there anything else I can do for you?
Good.<eos> You know, I'd really like it if you'd come stay with me for awhile.<eos> I know, Dad.<eos> I'm just busy right now.<eos> We've got a... one medium-rare burger there for you.
Previously on "Arrow"...<eos> Follow me or die.<eos> Hello, Mr. Queen.<eos> My name is Talia.<eos> I've been looking for you.
So what's going on at home?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Mom and Reggie were arguing a lot, and then all of a sudden he goes to Hong Kong.<eos> There's been an officer-involved shooting.<eos> I got a call to pick you up and bring you to the scene.
He washes up on you again, I want to be notified.<eos> It's in the computer, detective.<eos> Just make sure it happens.<eos> Yes?<eos> Mayor Ramos here to see you.
So naturally we're going to be a target for corporate espionage and political radicals.<eos> So, you believe the stealth ships are the work of...<eos> OPA moles?<eos> That's the theory that our security team is operating under.<eos> These moles are still your employees whom you hired and vetted through your security screenings.
But if it was a government contract, I'm sure that you would have full access to those same records.<eos> And here I thought you came in to clear up any misunderstandings.<eos> We're being polite, Monsieur Mao, but the Deputy Secretary and I are trying to stop a war.<eos> The fact is, these stealth ships were built by your company, under your watch.<eos> And the people of Earth will hold you personally responsible when the first rock falls from the sky.
Overdue.<eos> I have to start with an apology.<eos> I've been remiss.<eos> I should have reached out to you ages ago.<eos> But to be honest, I didn't see you, not clearly, not like this here now in person.
I'd like to file a motion.<eos> No, we're well past motions, Mr. Hawkes.<eos> I will not allow you to waste any more of this court's time.<eos> As an agent of Ohio law...<eos> Quiet, Mr. Hawkes, or I will find you in contempt.
Who got dropped off first?<eos> You or them? Er... Me.<eos> Cath Atwood would know who they were?<eos> Presumably, yes.<eos> And you said your wife was at the party?
Come on, let's get back to work. There's plenty to do.<eos> So that camera was in operation on the night of the party?<eos> Yes. I've put all the footage on here.<eos> It'll show whoever came in or out, this way at least.<eos> You weren't here yourself that night? No.
You and Steve need to get down to his house till the surveillance team's organised.<eos> I'm having Anna get all the background information on him.<eos> Any particular reason for this?<eos> Uh, I don't like him, and we rattled his cage earlier, so I wanna know what he does and where he goes.<eos> Alright. I'll let you know.
I will make the announcement.<eos> Sir, facing the press with only preliminary theories is like dropping blood in the water.<eos> And the timing alone is gonna raise questions.<eos> Somebody just tried to kill you, and now the Vice President gets murdered by his wife?<eos> Yeah, the press will be all over you for more details.
No, I asked him to get some rest and refocus, give us a chance to figure out what the hell is going on.<eos> In the meantime...<eos> I would like you to be my acting Chief of Staff.<eos> I'm throwing you in the deep end here.<eos> I won't let you down.
Why'd your client try to kill me on the island?<eos> I didn't know who was hunting me.<eos> You might've been Xavi.<eos> Sounds like you knew what he was up to.<eos> Detective, we came to you today in good faith.
- Yeah, just one.<eos> This way.<eos> The, uh... the lady at the convention gave this place a very high recommendation.<eos> - Oh, good.<eos> - Yeah. Your server will be right with you, okay?
Mr. McGill.<eos> So, on to the issue of bond.<eos> You have no priors and no outstanding warrants.<eos> And where are you currently practicing law?<eos> I haven't seen you in my court in a while.
I'll take him from here.<eos> Scottie asked me to escort you to the board.<eos> Phyllis.<eos> - It's wonderful to see you.<eos> - You, too, sir.
All I know is she had me render a video.<eos> She said the person on it was working against her and the company, and when I rendered it, his mug showed up.<eos> Deputy Director Cooper.<eos> It's not every day we get a visit from the FBI.<eos> What can I do for you?
- ... obstructed an NTSB investigation, let the shareholders in your company believe that you were dead.<eos> You got a lot of explaining to do.<eos> We'll look for Tom.<eos> You need to talk to a lawyer.<eos> - Tom Keen got to you.
Jason blossom.<eos> We're with him tonight.<eos> Now please, join me in welcoming to the field our very own river vixens,<eos> And their special guest stars, my daughter, josie and her pussycats!<eos> you're my candy girl the kind with the swirls baby out of this world fell in love with your curves conversation like, sir you ain't her put money on that girl you everything i deserve i'm ready to get served
Does he have any talent?<eos> See, I want to be supportive, but as a parent, it's really hard to watch your kid chase a dream they may never catch, when real-life opportunities are passing them by.<eos> Mr. Andrews, Archie...<eos> He has talent. Unquestionably.<eos> I'm not gonna lie to you.
My dad's away. We can do it at my house.<eos> We could all use a good time.<eos> Now you're talking my language.<eos> It's gonna be epic.<eos> Mr. Jones, I didn't mean to ambush you. I know you don't do birthdays, but Archie and I are having a few of Jughead's friends over at Archie's house.
- What does that mean?<eos> - It means you're getting your birthday party whether you want one or not.<eos> Dad, hey.<eos> Happy birthday, Jughead.<eos> How are you, Mr. Jones?
- Swagger still lives.<eos> - It's being handled.<eos> I don't like the unknown.<eos> Then get out of the espionage business.<eos> Perhaps we'll dig a hole for you, Mr. Meachum.
- He's in the Marines.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Where'd your boy deploy to?<eos> - He's in the UAE.<eos> It would be an honor to have you on the jury, sir.
What do you think I'm gonna get for it?<eos> $15,000, maybe $18,000.<eos> Ordinarily I wouldn't even do this.<eos> No commission.<eos> I'm here as a personal favor to you, Sheriff.
I do apologize for stopping therapy, but it wasn't because I wasn't taking care of myself.<eos> I understand, Norman.<eos> I hope you do because you really helped me a lot, Dr. Edwards.<eos> You helped me be able to go home and to deal with everything that happened.<eos> I couldn't have done that without you.
No, no, not since I... Not since I started the medicine.<eos> Where are you getting your prescriptions?<eos> They haven't called me for a refill in a year and a half.<eos> I just started going to a closer psychiatrist.<eos> It was too far to go to you, but I'm... I'm sorry.
Julia Ramos, representing Norman Bates.<eos> Would the defendant please stand?<eos> Are you Norman Bates, the individual named in the complaint of this matter?<eos> Yes. Yes, Your Honor.<eos> And do you authorize Julia Ramos to speak for you today?
- No.<eos> - What did you make of him?<eos> - I don't want to talk about it.<eos> Nevertheless, it's my job to find out how he died.<eos> I can't figure you out.
One more thing.<eos> Mrs Clark? I'll be on my way now.<eos> Actually, I did want to see you about something.<eos> - Would you put something on, please?<eos> - Does nakedness make you uncomfortable?
She will still need care.<eos> Care we can provide at Nonnatus House, surely?<eos> Would you like me to call the hospital?<eos> I could talk to her psychiatrist in my capacity as her GP.<eos> I'll come to you if I may, if I need your help, but I'd like to do as much as I possibly can myself.
Hey, you wanted to see me, sir.<eos> I...<eos> I just came for my camera. That's it.<eos> Jennifer... would you excuse us for a second?<eos> She was a threat to you, sir. To... To your candidacy,
Shit.<eos> Started a family, a business.<eos> Comprehensive Solutions.<eos> Security consulting. I've done well.<eos> Meadows ever work for you?
Next thing you know, he's pissing on the jukebox.<eos> And that's where you draw the line?<eos> I can put up with a lot. But when they start pissing on the jukebox, that's when I call the paddy wagon.<eos> The big guy buying the drinks? Um...<eos> like you, but white.
And if it doesn't?<eos> Let's not go there right now.<eos> We're gonna do everything we can to make sure she pulls through this.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I can't let you back here.
This is a small town.<eos> We take care of each other.<eos> I've heard a lot about you, Mr. Lockhart.<eos> Heard that you're an upstanding member of this community and someone people really look up to.<eos> I would think it'd be important to you to continue to do things the proper way.
You know that, Lieutenant.<eos> You know what they say about gamblers?<eos> It's not the winning they're addicted to.<eos> It's the losing.<eos> I have a few questions for you as well, Lieutenant.
It was our head chef.<eos> I think there is some fire in the eyes of my little Austrian friend.<eos> Please, speak your mind.<eos> We are just two poor refugees, far from our homes.<eos> This is the third time the dish has been cooked for you.
Have you ever tried the lobster at the Savoy?<eos> - I'm not sure that I have.<eos> - You have.<eos> February 4th of this year.<eos> You see, like you, it's my job to know things, too.
Get this under control. Now.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Sorry, sir.<eos> O'Hara?<eos> I didn't realise you were going to be here.
That's me... Mr. Glass-Half-Full. Come on.<eos> We'll hit up Billets on our way to the beach.<eos> Captain Lewis.<eos> Thank you for seeing me, sir.<eos> I just wanted to give you a heads up.
Let's face facts.<eos> It's going on what, four years now?<eos> I live in that neighborhood.<eos> People are scared.<eos> And I blame you, Chief Irving.
Just some.<eos> Just because you can't figure something out doesn't make it magic.<eos> What do you think Eros left behind on Venus?<eos> Little grey humanoids with big black eyes who've come to turn us into food?<eos> I'm astonished that Avasarala didn't kick you out of her office.
I think she may have been engaged once, but... .. I suppose everyone's got their own secret sadness, haven't they?<eos> I suppose. What's yours?<eos> Flat feet.<eos> Nurse. Thank you.<eos> Ah, you're with Mr Bright, yes?
- I'm being careful, Jo.<eos> - I should hope so.<eos> Not too long out of bed, Mr Talbot.<eos> How you feeling?<eos> I've brung you a few grapes, seeing as you've had no visitors.
- I don't know.<eos> Death?<eos> - Where'd you get it?<eos> - I told you, my friend threw it up.<eos> Mr. Wichita, I'd like you to come with me to the fifth floor.
You better think about what you're doing.<eos> We're doing our job.<eos> You're not helping Burkhardt.<eos> I suggest you take me back now.<eos> We're not taking you back.
He just wants to talk to you.<eos> - About what?<eos> - About what you do.<eos> Did you help Mrs. Cutler die?<eos> We're not here to arrest you.
For as long as you wish.<eos> You have a son.<eos> Your son is healthy, strong.<eos> He appears no worse for coming a month early.<eos> - I think we need to detain you no longer.
Bodrugan.<eos> I'll get my hat.<eos> Gentlemen, the voting to elect Truro's next Member of Parliament will now commence.<eos> Oh, Mr Buscombe!<eos> Erm... Now, that contract I obtained for you last month... It may have to be cancelled.
Our views are totally opposed!<eos> I see that.<eos> You're a hereditary peer who exists to command.<eos> You take governance as your right.<eos> For you, the common man has no rights.
- Not exactly -- but an arrangement with each other's banks whereby they will work together.<eos> I suspect this scheme has less to do with business ambition than political.<eos> Mr Pascoe.<eos> Sir Francis.<eos> Captain Poldark, you vanished from the wedding before I had chance to invite you and your charming wife to dinner.
You mean that sign out front?<eos> Gavin stole that.<eos> He said it was just as good as real security.<eos> Same with the fake cameras.<eos> Now, this... this wig, does this belong to you, sir?
Should be enough to cover your rent for the last three months.<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> - The clinic has a fund to help with this kind of thing.<eos> We do it all the time.<eos> But this is from you.
- I can't.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - Because I can't.<eos> - Yeah, I'll tell ya why you can't.<eos> Because a squeaky clean guy like you doesn't come to a guy like me unless he's got no choice, and you need me a hell of a lot more than I need you, so why don't you give me a call
Did you see anyone else on the path, in the woods?<eos> No one about, not at that hour.<eos> Ma'am.<eos> So, can you give your address to one of my officers?<eos> And they'll make sure you get home.
Can you say that again on camera?<eos> Yes, that'll be better.<eos> Ms. Goodwin, if you have a second...<eos> You know, dr. Halstead, there was a meeting last week, Open to anyone who had concerns about the video.<eos> I don't recall seeing you there.
How's his glucose?<eos> Totally normal.<eos> They said something in the waiting area. About signing some kind of release.<eos> Not necessary, mr. Mikulski.<eos> We'd like to send you on your way asap.
My office, please.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Close the door. Dr. Latham, I'm not sure how much of that.<eos> You heard back there.<eos> I believe most of it. If I said anything that may have offended you, I'm sorry...
There's something I should share with you.<eos> I have been recently diagnosed. With an autism spectrum disorder.<eos> Asperger's.<eos> Okay. I'm not revealing this to elicit sympathy from you, Or as a means to justify my behavior.<eos> I simply feel it might be beneficial for you to know.
How are you feeling?<eos> Cold.<eos> That's to be expected.<eos> The damage to your skin caused you to lose heat.<eos> We have another warmer coming in for you.
The shock is probably what tipped you over the edge.<eos> Everybody's a Monday morning quarterback.<eos> I don't know what that means, but I do know that we need to assess the extent of your coronary artery disease, so I want to send you up to the cath lab.<eos> Long as there's some hot cocoa in it for me, you got a deal.<eos> All right. I'll check back in with you soon.
I like to think I'm open to anything.<eos> To be continued.<eos> He's not drunk, and it wasn't his fault.<eos> The other car swerved right into his lane.<eos> It's your right to refuse the sobriety test, but we need to take you down to the station
May God make me truly worthy.<eos> Right.<eos> Good.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> You too.
What's going on here?<eos> I came to you to negotiate an exclusion in good faith.<eos> And we're prepared to offer you...<eos> We don't care what you're prepared to offer.<eos> And we didn't bring you here to give you an exclusion.
I'd be. I'm telling you that I can still win this.<eos> Still win?<eos> They're gonna make it seem like Shannon lied on purpose, and then I went out and hired a liar to cover it up.<eos> If you want someone else to handle this, I... Completely understand.<eos> The only problem with that is I went to 15 firms before I came to you, and none of them would take my case because of that photo.
Mr. Foley?<eos> Is your name Julia?<eos> Yes.<eos> He knows you.<eos> - Is he talking to you right now?
What were they doing in that rooming house?<eos> Well, both men had received letters from Foley enticing them there, sir.<eos> Did you write this?<eos> No.<eos> Do the names Robert Wilcox and Gerrard Berkeley mean anything to you?
How much?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Eight, nine pounds?<eos> Whatever I had in my wallet.<eos> - And why did he target you?
How long was Mary at her sister's?<eos> Er...<eos> I telephoned her, she came back home.<eos> So er... two, three hours.<eos> Only, your wife's sister told us that on Wednesday 1st May, she didn't see you or Mary.
- Just so you know.<eos> Not that I was planning on leaving.<eos> - Just so THAT you know.<eos> - Good.<eos> Good to see you again, Mr Bentley.
Go on, shift it to Comms.<eos> Is it me, or are WPCs getting younger and more attractive?<eos> Wish I could say the same for solicitors.<eos> I understand you're holding one of my clients here - - Mr O'Duncie.<eos> - Did he call you?
This is all we need.<eos> This is all we bloody need!<eos> My written English is not so good.<eos> What's this?<eos> It's to register you as an informant.
Objection.<eos> Calls for speculation.<eos> Objection is sustained.<eos> Okay, we'll move on.<eos> After Lillian Luthor saved you, did she order you to work for Cadmus?
To my wife, Georgina, I leave my collection of artworks.<eos> Excuse me, Monsieur, please forgive this intrusion but this is a police matter.<eos> I have a convocation to be served to the Clios family.<eos> Ah, but this is unprecedented.<eos> I also have warrants to be served to you, the family lawyer, concerning the Clios estate.
In return for what?<eos> Well, I would control the finances, uh, the accounting, investment oversight...<eos> Stuff like that.<eos> I would get to recoup 100% on my investment. I'd get two-and-a-half percent of... - you know, the net profits.<eos> Sir, you are delinquent on... on your property taxes... and you got those tenants that are suing you. I think there's three of them, yeah?
...cash investment where you, uh, you really can build out and reinvest maybe, you know, in a whole new boat.<eos> Could do a color here.<eos> If there's more product in here, and a little better lighting, it will get more people in.<eos> The aesthetic can come up and then the clientele can come up a little bit, and you'd be surprised...<eos> You know, your name's right here. Sir? You can put it right down here.
Captain Muller.<eos> Berlin Police.<eos> Is your husband at home?<eos> Good day, Herr Professor.<eos> It's an honor to meet you, though I regret the circumstances.
No, sir, I'm not.<eos> In the possession of the assassins, we found a list of targets.<eos> Minister Rathenau's name was on that list, and so was yours, Herr Professor.<eos> These men are part of a larger movement.<eos> I'm afraid it may not be safe for you to remain in Berlin.
And I'll never get an office like this, will I?<eos> There is a good school 25 miles west of here.<eos> I know a teacher who will take you in.<eos> You study for a year, well, you go to a zoo, you learn some French, and then you'll come back here and you'll retake the exam.<eos> I won't disappoint you, sir.
You said you were surprised that they missed him?<eos> Well, they talk about him like they hate his fucking guts most of the time.<eos> That way they don't hate me.<eos> He's willing to put himself in that spot.<eos> So it's his loyalty that matters to you.
So it's his loyalty that matters to you.<eos> This isn't about me.<eos> You didn't have to walk down here to see if I knew where Wags was, boyo.<eos> You could've just called.<eos> You came in here because you want it to be about you.
This isn't about me.<eos> You didn't have to walk down here to see if I knew where Wags was, boyo.<eos> You could've just called.<eos> You came in here because you want it to be about you.<eos> Because you need it to be about you.
Because you need it to be about you.<eos> And I am here for exactly that purpose.<eos> Really?<eos> Let me into that kitchen.<eos> What specific role does Wags serve for you?
You think I'd miss your celebration this evening?<eos> Of course.<eos> Your wife must be looking forward to it.<eos> It is a promotion for her as well, isn't it?<eos> For you.
Well, Dr. Cleary, you're fit.<eos> You're busy.<eos> Pregnancy's not an illness.<eos> Perhaps you just need more rest at this stage.<eos> Well, I'll show you out.
Mrs. Saperstein?<eos> Special Agent Robert Stahl.<eos> I'm with the FBI.<eos> - Do you have a moment?<eos> - Not for you.
The case was dismissed.<eos> Your exgirlfriend was gunned down by a man allegedly working for Mr. Bianchi. Is that correct?<eos> Caroline Winston.<eos> We'd been engaged.<eos> Did Bianchi seek you out in the courthouse, or did you make contact with him?
Tuesday? Last Tuesday, I think.<eos> - What time?<eos> - Uh, I'm not sure.<eos> Disappeared, huh?<eos> Our records indicate he called you that night at, uh, 11:47 p.m.
Well, trust me when I tell you, I've seen dumber.<eos> My dealings with Bobby Dean were amicable.<eos> I offered him an above-market price for a failing business.<eos> Well, this place has a history of chewing up men who come in here thinking they're smarter than us.<eos> Far more formidable men than you.
Charlie!<eos> Charlie, come here! Sorry, boys.<eos> Saul!<eos> Yeah?<eos> Peachy, Mr. Gold, we'll be with you very shortly.
You asked for this meeting.<eos> What is it you want?<eos> You raided the cartel members and you shut down their operations.<eos> In the name of the state of Culiacán, I thank you.<eos> Cartel members that betrayed you to work for your wife.
Attack ships on fire?<eos> Yes.<eos> The very best cases gone forever, like tears in rain.<eos> No replicant... no lawyer is gonna rattle me.<eos> Mr. Axelrod, you say the U. S. Attorney harassed you, that he overstepped the bounds of his office.
No replicant... no lawyer is gonna rattle me.<eos> Mr. Axelrod, you say the U. S. Attorney harassed you, that he overstepped the bounds of his office.<eos> Are you sure he didn't have legitimate reason to come to your place of business?<eos> At that hour?<eos> No. His wife worked for you.
They're squared away.<eos> Drop down a rung.<eos> Follow his top people.<eos> Okay.<eos> And this... is for you.
How do you know he didn't have a legitimate reason to be in your office?<eos> Well, it was the middle of the night.<eos> He didn't come with a SWAT team, not even a subpoena.<eos> It was just him, trying to intimidate me.<eos> But his wife works for you.
In the meantime, I'll have my office work up a new authentication protocol,<eos> - just for you.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Wait! Commander, don't leave.<eos> Is there something I can do for you, Mr. Maro?
- You're not a doctor.<eos> - True, I'm not.<eos> But I gained some experience treating myself.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I did that to you.
How did you wait before showing me this letter from General Arnold?<eos> One day, sir.<eos> And only that because I gave it no regard.<eos> I never once gave him cause to think me a defector.<eos> I'm as disgusted by the insinuation as you must be.
I'm as disgusted by the insinuation as you must be.<eos> The hay in Setauket is of so much consequence that the attempt must be made.<eos> Colonel Sheldon will furnish you with a detachment.<eos> And I commit to you the execution of this order, major.<eos> We won't fail you, sir.
She's saying she's gonna miss me.<eos> She says we should run away together.<eos> I've no idea where any of this is coming from, so I pull the car over... just to talk, mind.<eos> - And er...<eos> - What, she makes a move on you?
It's a leather folio once owned by Benjamin Banneker.<eos> I... I do have a rare Banneker folio.<eos> It's in the vault downstairs.<eos> Would you be a dear and go fetch that?<eos> What made you first pick up the item?
You represent the senator?<eos> Eric Beaumont.<eos> Negotiator.<eos> Can I get a beer over here?<eos> Do you want a beer?
Wait a minute.<eos> Peter MacLeish is president?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hannah... tell me what evidence you have against Peter MacLeish.<eos> Speaker Hookstraten to see you, sir.
Prepare to enter.<eos> Mr. Vice President, I'm advising against this course of action,<eos> - in the strongest of terms.<eos> - Noted.<eos> I have a duty, sir, to you and the president...
Agent Wells, this is my wife, Alex.<eos> - Pleased to meet you.<eos> - Ma'am.<eos> Please continue.<eos> Respectfully, sir, this information is only for you and your security team.
All I know is what the White House switchboard operator told me... That Aaron made the call to the Secretary of Defense right before the threat-assessment memo was recalled by the Pentagon.<eos> And he confronted you?<eos> Yes. He found out I was making inquiries.<eos> He was very upset.<eos> He asked what I was doing. I told him he needed to talk to you.
Yeah?<eos> Car's ready, Mr. Vice President.<eos> Thanks, Rich.<eos> It's just the two of you, right?<eos> As you requested, sir.
You need some personal time.<eos> - Take maybe a week.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> I would like you to be my acting chief of staff.<eos> I won't let you down.
At least, she said she did.<eos> And so she asked me to help her get some intel on some government highway contract. It was that sort of thing for a while.<eos> And then she asked to see the threat assessment on the Capitol renovation.<eos> Room 105.<eos> And that didn't make you suspicious?
I'm afraid you have no choice, sir.<eos> Seth is distributing my statement to the press as we speak.<eos> Without talking to me.<eos> I mean no disrespect.<eos> But it is my primary job to protect you, even from your most generous instincts.
- we're never gonna get through this. - Okay.<eos> You're falling into professor mode again.<eos> Carol from Philadelphia doesn't give a damn about academic surveys.<eos> She cares that she has to take two buses to find an affordable grocery store.<eos> And she wants to know that you care about that, too.
And I won't do that.<eos> Now, the reason why jobs like yours have disappeared isn't just because of cheaper labor in some other country.<eos> Primarily, it's technology.<eos> Technology allows one person to do what used to take 10.<eos> Now, that might be great for the economy, but it's not for you... or your family.
President Moss wants to get back into politics.<eos> Your country needs you, preferably as Secretary of State.
I'm excited for both of us.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> No, thank you.<eos> Today's legislation deals a serious blow to Senator Jack Bowman, who clearly underestimated the president's ability to build a successful coalition in the House of Representatives.<eos> Senator, Liam Price to see you.
So, we leave it to the next president to pick the Chief Justice?<eos> Not necessarily, but our nation needs a Supreme Court up and running as quickly as possible.<eos> Senator?<eos> Okay.<eos> I can wait you out, sir.
- Hi.<eos> - The love of my life.<eos> Really?<eos> I thought you were...<eos> It is such an honor to meet you, Mr. Riley.
The arrhythmia was caused by a minor septal defect, which means there's a very small hole between two of the heart's chambers.<eos> Now some people may choose, uh, not to repair the hole, and treat it with medication. But I strongly suggest surgery.<eos> Let me explain to you exactly what's going on.<eos> Although this is a more serious surgery, I've performed it many times.<eos> We go in and stabilize you with diuretics, and then repair the septal defect.
- We have three babies.<eos> I like to think that maybe one day, you'll be an old man like me, talking a younger man's ear off, explaining to him how you took the sourest lemon that life has to offer...<eos> - Which one's yours?<eos> - Um and turned it into something resembling lemonade.<eos> Wow. How about you? Which one's yours?
Thank you.<eos> Take it away.<eos> Um... numbers.<eos> Let's talk numbers.<eos> It's been a, uh, strong quarter... for us. Uh... and for you, Mr. Buchanan.
How'd you get in here?<eos> Oh, just bribed the assistant, Tracy.<eos> You know, big Manny fan.<eos> I came here to beg you to come to opening night of my play.<eos> I did go to opening night, you didn't.
What-- what the hell number are you calling from?<eos> No, no, this is-- this is Ron. Ron Howard.<eos> This is-- this is my number.<eos> I am a huge fan of yours.<eos> Now, what-what-what-- what can I do for you?
- I know.<eos> - We know.<eos> Look, Dr. Lee, um... I've been feeling much better, as you know.<eos> I've taken some time off work.<eos> I've been checking in with you.
It's the last he and I ever spoke.<eos> Well, that didn't take too long.<eos> Megan? Megan?<eos> - Hey. Maybe you can help me unload the car.<eos> Can I help you?
Did you ever know a woman, truck driver, who took your heart and rattled it like a baby in a cage?<eos> Who joined you for years on a sequence of heists and schemes until the two of you were forced apart by circumstance, and also because you ran off in the middle of the night with a bunch of her valuables?<eos> Uh, no, I've been in the lumber industry all my life.<eos> You can let me off here, in the middle of town.<eos> For you.
Well, you know...<eos> I like to think that that one fine day, it won't matter a whit to you what anybody says sideways.<eos> You have a good imagination.<eos> I suppose it would be true enough to say I'm sorry.<eos> I am sorry I upset Miss Marilla. And you.
I suppose it would be true enough to say I'm sorry.<eos> I am sorry I upset Miss Marilla. And you.<eos> So go and smooth things over, can't you?<eos> Very well. I'll attempt it.<eos> For you.
What is your location?<eos> House two-four-zero.<eos> All right, Mr. Ambassador.<eos> Stay with me.<eos> I'll get you through this.
The nonexistent kind.<eos> I keep to myself.<eos> Did you hear that your neighbors were all shot in the head?<eos> He's asking because if you were to believe you lived next door to zombies, you might choose to fix that problem by shooting your neighbors in the head.<eos> And from the recordings we have of the Chuck Burd show, it sure sounds like you believed you had a zombie problem.
Harry!<eos> Krystina, I rely on you.<eos> I trust your judgment.<eos> The next operational team that goes out, you're in.<eos> I won't let you down.
Leaves nothing written. For security.<eos> Of course. Very prudent.<eos> You will be kept sequestered until the last moment, at 7:30.<eos> Your award should take no more than 10 minutes.<eos> I'll escort you back to your laboratory,
How was your afternoon? Other than a minor air raid,<eos> Everything was satisfactory. Wonderful.<eos> Herr oberguppenfuhrer!<eos> Hello, reinhardt.<eos> How are you?
- It was stupid, okay?<eos> I thought they were process servers sent by my wife.<eos> We're in the middle of a nasty divorce.<eos> I was trying to avoid going back to court.<eos> It's been a tough few months for you, James.
Mindy, I'm so sorry.<eos> I love you... so much.<eos> It was you?<eos> Let's have a baby.<eos> Dr. Webber, how are you?
Start to finish. I'd like Dr. Warren to scrub in as primary surgeon.<eos> You'd like?<eos> And you can assist and help... only when requested... but it will be Dr. Warren's O.R.<eos> Why don't you let Bailey take this one?<eos> Because I've assigned it to you.
Need something?<eos> Yeah, I'm on your service today.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> I didn't request a resident.<eos> Dr. Minnick assigned me to you.
Can I do this in the morning?<eos> Of course you can.<eos> - Everything can wait until tomorrow.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Is there anything else I can do for you?
No, I...<eos> I have to figure things out for myself now.<eos> I-I...<eos> Thank you.<eos> Here. That's for you.
- Tarr19. - All right.<eos> And you will go online and ask him or her to meet about the blackout tonight?<eos> - I might.<eos> - No.<eos> One for you, and one for me.
And so in step number five of your method, the interviewer is to present evidence of culpability to the suspect, whether it's true or not?<eos> Well, it's better if the evidence is true, of course.<eos> But it doesn't have to be?<eos> No.<eos> So when Benji presented Frank with a DVD recording of him stealing the $70,000 in running shoes... a DVD that was completely blank, by the way... that was A-okay with you?
That's just one posting flagged as problematic by my moderators.<eos> Here are... 4,758 more.<eos> That's why I called you here today.<eos> Oh, and also I wanted to see what my new Midwest law firm looked like.<eos> We're glad to have you here, Mr. Gross.
You've been reinstated.<eos> I don't accept your reinstatement.<eos> You're a clown.<eos> What's worse is you're a smart clown who occasionally has a point, a point you destroy by mixing it up with racism and misogyny you probably don't even believe.<eos> When you were little, someone rejected you or made fun of you, and now you get to be one of the mean guys, making fun of others.
- That was not the point of this firm. - Now, what are we...<eos> - Are you serious, Carl?<eos> Come on, come on...<eos> Diane Lockhart.<eos> Pastor Jeremiah, how are you?
You just saved his ass.<eos> Thank you, Jay.<eos> Good to know.<eos> Hello, Officer Theroux. Hello.<eos> This is a familiar spot for you... Being questioned about police brutality.
And rude. Sustained to the first.<eos> Overruled to the second.<eos> Officer, um, do you work out at Savoy's Gym?<eos> Yes, why?<eos> Do you recall yesterday afternoon sparring with a 19-year-old welterweight named Hector Peraza who, according to eyewitnesses, - knocked you out?
When the facts are on your side, you pound the facts.<eos> When the facts are not on your side...<eos> Come on.<eos> Are you kidding me? Counselor, sit down right now.<eos> You'll get your turn.
There's something I'd like to show you, Captain.<eos> Terry... crushed... it.<eos> It works!<eos> I've never been more proud of you for anything in your life.<eos> I mean, I've solved a lot of cases for you.
I'm gonna stop you before you say something you shouldn't. This my family we're talking about.<eos> No!<eos> In surgery, we call it - "a complication."<eos> - We've hit a snag a bump in the road... turbulence.<eos> Sir, I can gate check that for you.
Dr. Hunt? Yes. You asked to see me?<eos> Um, this morning...<eos> This morning...<eos> You saved her. You saved our baby girl.<eos> I never could have done what you did.
She loved coming here when she was younger.<eos> We all need an escape, and this was hers.<eos> You mean from my Dad.<eos> Maybe she was seeking someone who loved her unconditionally.<eos> You? Creep.
Move that appointment to later this afternoon.<eos> Ms. Bloom, this is Eric Beaumont.<eos> - Beaumont.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Your reputation precedes you.
Yeah, of course.<eos> Are you sure having her here at home is the best thing?<eos> She'd probably be better off in a comprehensive care facility.<eos> I'm trying to give my mother the best possible care, and it's just I feel like she feels safer and happier with me at home.<eos> Maybe if you were here all the time, she would, but when you're gone, she's suffering.
Thought I sent you to Birmingham for a packet of crisps.<eos> Yeah, I saw through your cunning ruse...!<eos> Yes, well, if you will go thinking for yourself...<eos> What do you want?<eos> I was given strict instructions to keep you at the university.
You do know we're still here, right?<eos> Didn't I send you out to get me a latte?<eos> So, what's the plan?<eos> Well, we've all been trying to get a radio working and the Doctor's been... ..thinking.<eos> Don't mean to hurry you, but in 700 breaths I'll be dead.
I had the biggest crush on you.<eos> Oh, I can't blame you. Chilly.<eos> Hey, you guys hungry?<eos> I know a good burger joint on the way back. Thank you for agreeing to see me, sir.<eos> I'm always happy to make time for you, Agent Beeman.
Mr. Holmes here recognized the ash from your pipe on the man's lapel.<eos> You stood over your victim a little too long, didn't you?<eos> Perhaps you regretted bashing his parietal bone in with Robert E. Lee's field glasses.<eos> Perhaps you paused to wipe off your hastily chosen weapon before returning it to its display case.<eos> One of these is for you. But before we get to it, I thought you might want to name your accomplice.
Both of whom are still in jail-- my point.<eos> Is this a shakedown, Dwayne?<eos> Is that what this is?<eos> Just asking for a friendly favor is all.<eos> Up to you... if you accept it or not.
His real name is Joel Hanson.<eos> He's Gretchen's husband.<eos> Don't even... Not a word.<eos> You're gonna be so happy.<eos> This, Mr. Keegan, is merely a sample of the kind of indulgences with which I can supply you and your establishments.
New York City's drinking water needs to be shut off.<eos> Now.<eos> This is Special Agent David Breslin from the Department of Homeland Security, and this is Wendell Hecht, EVP, of Water Integrity at the city's. Department of Environmental Protection.<eos> Gentlemen, this is Sherlock Holmes and Joan Watson.<eos> The D.E.P. owes you a great debt.
I'm flattered.<eos> But don't you think I'm a little... old?<eos> You're only as old as you feel.<eos> Well, I feel older than I am.<eos> Mr. Bennett, if my child ever had a problem... I can't imagine anyone I'd want them coming to more than you.
I don't know.<eos> It's the only way to find out what she's thinkin'.<eos> - Appreciate it, Abby.<eos> - Oh, anytime, Mr. Bennett.<eos> If I ever need advice about Colt and me, I'll come to you.
Love you, Max.<eos> Sergeant Grover.<eos> I'll miss your smile.<eos> Yes, that one.<eos> I know a part of you will always belong to Chicago, but Hawaii has claimed you as one of its sons, and I truly believe that the islands are a better place because you are here.
Yeah, she called me, crying.<eos> Waah, waah, like a... Like a pathetic goat.<eos> Next thing I know, her lesbo sister's blaming me because Lily went full Whitney Houston in the bathtub.<eos> You should've taken the two years, Mr. Clark.<eos> Now I'm charging you with Lily's murder.
But there's something you should know before I pull the plug.<eos> - What did I just say?<eos> - It's about Sean Clark.<eos> I ran his name through Omaha, and I got a hit on an archived wiretap, a recorded phone conversation from last year.<eos> Sean Clark, wonderful to hear from you.
- Now you listen to me --<eos> - Just tell us what happened this morning.<eos> The Michonnet woman arrived with her overcooked pastries.<eos> She's the neighbour who raised the alarm.<eos> She works for you?
It's a joke.<eos> Until we know for sure, I'm erring on the side of caution.<eos> People are worried.<eos> Mr. Reeves?<eos> Mayor Salgado on line one for you and the captain.
I'm so proud of you. And also you should know that, from personal experience, it doesn't matter how far you travel or where you go, you can always come back home, okay?<eos> And if you ever do decide to do that, you got a job and got your Five-O ohana waiting for you.<eos> Mahalo.<eos> Yeah, man.<eos> I believe that's you.
Get off him!<eos> You okay, sir?<eos> About to call you an ambulance.<eos> This is not Black Lives Matter!<eos> I'm gonna call the ambulance for you right now, okay?
- Psych. I'm too busy to get to my phone right now.<eos> Leave a message.<eos> For god's sake.<eos> Did you have a nice nap, Stacey?<eos> Look at you all snug as a bug in a rug in our blissful hereafter model in mahogany!
Reconnect with your long-lost son?<eos> You know, I drive Mr. Kaminski around a lot.<eos> We've gotten close.<eos> You can kiss that good-bye.<eos> So, uh, Mr. Danon, if-if I may ask, why did you never contact Mr. Kaminski, even after he wrote to you?
I would.<eos> According to LexisNexis, the only time it was ever cited was in a book called "Negotiate Up."<eos> Do you know who wrote that book?<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> I can sign it for you, if you like.
Adele has all the information.<eos> Awesome.<eos> That's just so exciting.<eos> Um, thank you.<eos> I won't let you down.
I'm not a man who generally looks a gift horse in the mouth, but why would Broussard attack the Red Hand?<eos> What did he want?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Show me the roof.<eos> Sir, the Governor-General is here for you.
Krystina, I rely on you.<eos> I trust your judgment.<eos> But by keeping you here, I'm depriving the war effort of an agent. With the skill and the courage needed for us to win.<eos> The next operational team that goes out, you're in.<eos> I won't let you down.
We just think he's being made a patsy by someone from the government, and he wants to leave the country before he's arrested.<eos> That's ridiculous.<eos> He's right upstairs.<eos> I'll go get him.<eos> Do you know where your daughter is right now, Mr. Robertson?
We'll still be watching this one.<eos> Can you read lips?<eos> Well, Mr. Callen, I've reviewed the charges.<eos> Honestly, I don't think they have much of a case.<eos> So I've prepared a statement for you.
Can you read lips?<eos> Well, Mr. Callen, I've reviewed the charges.<eos> Honestly, I don't think they have much of a case.<eos> So I've prepared a statement for you.<eos> Please feel free to look it over while I get you the hell out of here.
We will make gains this weekend. - Shore things up by Monday's vote. - Mmm.<eos> Mr. President, it's possible we may need to consider the other option.<eos> A rescheduled election.<eos> No, no, I'll get Rasmussen back in line, and turn some others along the way.<eos> We've arranged sit-downs for you and Madam President with all of the small states.
This is a meeting of the Congressional Black Caucus.<eos> Well, I understand. That's... why we're here.<eos> I was told 9:00, and it's already been an hour.<eos> You should have been told 10:00.<eos> And you will get your opportunity to address us.
Minister Xu, are you still there?<eos> Collaborating with President Petrov is always a mistake.<eos> The 20% tariff will help you keep that in mind.<eos> I'm waiting.<eos> It's up to you if they live or die.
- No, ma'am.<eos> I don't think the president knew what Doug was up to.<eos> Not at all.<eos> Mr. Hammerschmidt.<eos> I've been meaning to call you.
I was hoping you'd be able to solve this one for me.<eos> Thank you for coming to talk to me.<eos> Didn't have much choice.<eos> Not with that big oaf dragging me in.<eos> I didn't drag you.
- Why?<eos> - So I could kill them.<eos> It had to be done.<eos> But they were locked up! Behind bars...<eos> No danger to you.
The Feds are not gonna get a peek at our clients' business.<eos> Be ready to hit the kill switch.<eos> Colonel Jackson. Hey.<eos> You seem like a good guy, is what I don't get, being all you can be.<eos> I bet your soldiers look up to you.
So why are you here, Jordan?<eos> Clearly don't agree with your parents suing Mrs. Bryant.<eos> Yes he does.<eos> They said I had to be here.<eos> What kind of doctor are you?
- Exactly.<eos> So if a juror respects Ms. Anderson, they'll respect rules.<eos> She'll be doing our work for us and never even know it.<eos> Speak up.<eos> I can't hear you.
- No, sir, it's not.<eos> - And that you would do everything in your power to stop their impending marriage? Jake's lying.<eos> How could you talk all this crap, man?<eos> Just answer the question, Mr. Soto.<eos> In fact, you went there alone and stabbed him to death because the thought of Trevor and Mia together enraged you.
We're not quite sure.<eos> We thought, at first, you may have had a series of mini strokes, but the MRis, the EEGs, they rule that out. Where is Dembe?<eos> Dembe will know.<eos> I don't know who that is.<eos> But the man who drove you here left as soon as you stabilized. I don't remember.
We know that he specializes in untraceable toxins, and that you hired him to create that allergic reaction. What is she talking about?<eos> You can play dumb, Mr. Panetti.<eos> From what I hear, you've made quite a profession out of skirting responsibility for your actions.<eos> - Now, hang on. - We can find him on our own.<eos> And when we do, you'll realize that this trial you're facing is a small matter when compared to what happens when the full force of the FBI comes down on you and your organization.
You've all benefited from your seats at this table.<eos> We owe a great debt to Mr. Westmorland.<eos> I don't carry debt, Ms. Duncan.<eos> Mr. Al-Khatib, we freed your daughter from a genetic heart defect.<eos> What is that worth to you?
Rachel.<eos> I'm just checking in to make sure that you're all right.<eos> Why wouldn't I be?<eos> Well, I've asked you to do something that you don't want to do.<eos> I would do anything for you.
Hey, buddy.<eos> - Hi. - Stuck in, uh, traffic for over an hour. Ew.<eos> Well, we have been waiting for almost two hours.<eos> Well, I'm in the middle of a very busy afternoon.<eos> What can I do for you?
You know what? Forget it.<eos> You know, me and my giving heart will see you later.<eos> Hey. - Boden?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Chief, what can I do for you?
What makes you think that I want to be the one - to put him behind bars?<eos> - Mr. Hart...<eos> We're done here.<eos> And if you tell anyone who I am, you're gonna have more than one Capone to worry about.<eos> Did you know that he takes ads out in newspapers, looking for you?
Did you know that he takes ads out in newspapers, looking for you?<eos> All over the country, for years.<eos> He misses you.<eos> I understand how hard it must be for you to face him.<eos> I've had to give up family, too, and nobody should have to do that, but maybe he will listen to you.
He's lost a lot of blood.<eos> - Can you stand?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> We're just gonna take him there ourselves.<eos> Thank you for your help. I know this was hard for you.
- and Withrow, Really? - Dr. Bull?<eos> He committed suicide, Your Honor.<eos> Who knows why?<eos> I think the defendant knows why. Right, Withrow?<eos> Dr. Bull, one more word from you, and you'll spend the night in jail.
Their hands are tied.<eos> Chief Anderson can damn well reassign firefighters.<eos> He outranks me!<eos> These assignments are permanent.<eos> Well, bully for you!
Your men and women were remarkable.<eos> Every one of 'em.<eos> Thank you.<eos> They'll take great pride in that.<eos> Chief, I'm here because I'd like to talk to the mayor about a commendation for you.
I was used, too.<eos> If you talk to T... We did.<eos> Well, then, she told you.<eos> I'm one of the good guys.<eos> Just because you informed on Joe Aufiero doesn't mean you're good.
If you don't go for her, I will.<eos> What?<eos> Are you sure?<eos> I mean, I didn't even know that Jack was out.<eos> He hasn't tried to contact you, or call you?
Mm-hmm, but we need to know if it fell from his person, or if it was placed on the victim by someone else.<eos> You think Gordon was set up?<eos> Do a calcium carbonate test. Let's find out.<eos> You can uncuff me now.<eos> I ain't gonna hurt you.
I'll call after lunch if I need anything else.<eos> This is a surprise, Ms. Winter.<eos> Who's your friend?<eos> Joan Watson.<eos> She's here to make sure I don't beat you too soundly if you lie to me again.
Come on in.<eos> Lieutenant Casey would like to have a word.<eos> That was the first day you had.<eos> Yeah, it was.<eos> Is there anything I can get for you, Chief?
Kensi and Deeks are on their way to the boatshed<eos> - to talk to him now. - Me and G will go to the crime scene, see what we can find.<eos> Okay.<eos> All right, we're off to Beverly Hills.<eos> Mr. Callen, I've got something else for you.
Agent Pride?<eos> General Walsh.<eos> Heard a lot about you.<eos> It's nice to finally meet you.<eos> You, too, General.
I don't know.<eos> Physical scars often indicate deep emotional ones as well.<eos> If you'd like, one of our trained psychologists could...<eos> What does this have to do with anything?<eos> Please. I don't mean to upset you.
Captain Grover.<eos> That's my name.<eos> What can I do for you?<eos> I'm Officer Bennett.<eos> I've been assigned to you.
We'll ask the questions.<eos> By all means.<eos> Just don't count on us answering any of them.<eos> Just leave it.<eos> Is this the gentleman who kidnapped you? Yeah, that's him.
She is.<eos> So the merchandise is of the highest quality, Mr. Kim.<eos> And unlike Epifanio's product, it can be delivered to you today.<eos> I was assured that Epifanio's delivery issue will resolve itself shortly.<eos> No, his delay's costing you millions of dollars.
Mr. Schlottman.<eos> Matthew, come in.<eos> How goes the battle?<eos> You shut 'em down yet?<eos> I wish I had better news for you.
Still my perfect Saturday night.<eos> Excellent.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> Yes, congratulations, congressman Edelstein.<eos> Aron's going to make you and your wife very, very proud.
Well, what he deserves is a needle in his arm.<eos> I'll be damned if we're handing him evidence so he can overturn his conviction.<eos> Just move on.<eos> I appreciate you seeing me.<eos> What can we do for you, Mr. Mathis?
None.<eos> But he killed plenty of animals.<eos> He worked at a slaughterhouse.<eos> Same as his father.<eos> Because your father killed cows, you were destined to kill women.
That's the kind of officer he is, has been, and always will be until someone finally does something.<eos> And now, Sergeant Voight is chasing ghosts on a 17-year-old case, disobeying direct orders and neglecting his duties as head of the Intelligence Unit.<eos> You're gonna wanna see this.<eos> Lieutenant Woods, you are stripped of your police powers immediately.<eos> And you are placed on a no-pay status until a full investigation is conducted into every case you have ever worked.
- If you let me...<eos> - You have to go.<eos> - I...<eos> Lieutenant?<eos> There's someone looking for you.
That's what made this mess.<eos> Do you think Darius did it, that's he's a... that he's a traitor?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry. I should have...<eos> I should have listened to you, not-not him.
He talked to you six times last week.<eos> Can we assume it was about the blood samples he wanted you to gather from the copies of the Constitution?<eos> Hey, what are you doing?<eos> Mr. Drexel, we didn't bring the police with us because we don't care about your minor league embezzlement.<eos> We don't. It was a courtesy to you, but it also works in our favor, 'cause it means we can conduct an illegal search for the materials that Fred gave you.
Now my job, Mr. Stone, is imparting knowledge and wisdom.<eos> What wisdom is more important than "don't buy something that might kill your neighbor?"<eos> And people who don't accept your wisdom....<eos> Well... there will always be ignorant jackasses.<eos> Just so you know... I own a gun, sir.
Hello?<eos> Sir?<eos> I can't hear you, one moment please!<eos> Hello?<eos> I can't hear you.
You were trying to buy an anatomy book that was published in Germany during World War II.<eos> So what?<eos> I'm allowed to do that.<eos> We don't ban books in this country yet, do we?<eos> I get the sense that the irony of that statement is lost on you, but no, we don't care that you bid on that book.
What will they think of Farraday Publishing?<eos> You've all been profiting off the work of a Nazi for decades.<eos> That's why you killed Claude Rysher, isn't it?<eos> Somehow, you realized how close he was getting to exposing your granddad.<eos> Or maybe he reached out to you, and maybe it got back to you that he was poking around in Turnleaf's old records, so you broke into his apartment, and you sabotaged his favorite magic trick.
That's crazy.<eos> The guy who loaned us that book said it wasn't as hard as we thought to find other copies.<eos> When we looked into that, we saw one had just been sold with basically the same item description as the one that Mr. Rysher bought.<eos> It listed damage to the lower spine and a water stain on the cover, so we paid the buyer a visit.<eos> This book... the one she got from you... Has your prints and Rysher's all over it.
Diane Fowler.<eos> These are all people Reddington murdered while working with you, correct?<eos> Agent Mojtabai, the grand jury has subpoenaed your testimony.<eos> You have immunity.<eos> Nothing you say can incriminate you, so you can be compelled to answer!
You may observe privately, Mr Stirling.<eos> Unless invited to share your thoughts, I do not expect to hear...<eos> Under Section 2 of the National Crimes Commission Act...<eos> Section 2 refers to counsel representing, Mr Stirling.<eos> You are present under Section 9, which is at my invitation.
Yeah, had a bright future at the club, didn't he Mitchell?<eos> Angelou.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> G'day, mate...<eos> Can you think of any reason why he might take a performance-enhancing drug without you knowing?
Have you got any evidence to support that?<eos> Bigots in your community - they look at brown people, and they immediately assume we're terrorists.<eos> Yeah, well, let's just sidestep the identity politics.<eos> It's discrimination!<eos> Our treatment of you has nothing to do with discrimination, and everything to do with your propensity to lie.
No, no, anything I had came from him... Eddie.<eos> So you admit possession.<eos> No, well, it depends...<eos> Okay, these are the facts, Flynn.<eos> The drug that caused Tyler's death is the same drug that almost killed Pearl's friend, and we know that because Pearl got the drug from you.
Nate.<eos> Thank you for your help.<eos> I doubt that anything I said would have made a difference.<eos> You know, the Richard I used to know would have at least tried.<eos> Mr Cooke, we now have two witnesses stating that the drug THX-5 supplied to Northern Devils players came from you.
We have to get to London.<eos> I'll explain everything.<eos> - We have to get to London.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> This is for you.
Of course.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I read your interview yesterday.<eos> And my son was in prison too.<eos> But... unlike you, he didn't make it out.
I was going. I am.<eos> I will.<eos> Have you two been having trouble?<eos> Nope.<eos> Something's keeping you.
Keisuke, you also liked surprising people, didn't you?<eos> Will you marry me?<eos> You probably don't want to.<eos> A beautiful, 21-year-old lady and an old man like me.<eos> If it pleases you, I would be glad to.
Hey!<eos> Have I done something wrong?<eos> No.<eos> It's just a whim.<eos> What should I do for you?
He's relevant, and he'll lead to more sales for the industry as a whole.<eos> We may as well decide on him right now.<eos> Yeah, you're right.<eos> I'm sorry for being late.<eos> Mr. Chiba, though you're the chairman, we've basically decided without you that the winner will be Yuzu Hanaki.
Well...<eos> What was the question again?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> When you heard you received the prize...<eos> You're the editor for Shin Michima, aren't you?
But a few days after my father committed his crime, she left me without saying a word.<eos> POPULAR NOVELIST LIVING IN THE SAME HOUSE WITH FIVE WOMEN!<eos> Mr. Sakurai, can I talk to you?<eos> What?<eos> Actually, I have a huge favor to ask you.
Since I was a kid, it was normal for me to sleep in a chair while on location.<eos> I got used to it.<eos> I see.<eos> Mr. Sakurai.<eos> I have cooperated with you, so... I want you to take care of Michi, all right?
You're all quite dedicated, aren't you? But give him a break, will you?<eos> Mr. Sakurai, thank you for coming all the way here today.<eos> Not at all.<eos> I owe a lot to Ms. Hiraki.<eos> Also, there's something I want to tell you.
-Okay.<eos> You've chosen to live a very simple life, I see.<eos> Yes.<eos> Thanks for coming all the way here, but I have no idea what to write.<eos> I've come with some good news for you, Mr. Michima.
You've chosen to live a very simple life, I see.<eos> Yes.<eos> Thanks for coming all the way here, but I have no idea what to write.<eos> I've come with some good news for you, Mr. Michima.<eos> All three books that you've already published... are going to be reprinted!
How bad is it?<eos> He's in a coma.<eos> They don't know if he'll recover.<eos> Pardon me, Detective.<eos> There's a phone call for you.
How the fuck are we gonna cuff him now?<eos> Oh, Gregor.<eos> My hands.<eos> My beautiful hands!<eos> The ambassador will see you now.
Think I'm about to have my first fight, ever.<eos> This is the complaint I was telling you about.<eos> - What's going on here?<eos> - Team talk.<eos> I find that rather surprising considering you were not with the team earlier.
What can I do for you, Mr Turner?<eos> I'd like to send a telegram, please.<eos> - There you are.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> I have some post for you.
- Thank you.<eos> I have some post for you.<eos> I'll just have a look, see if I can find it.<eos> Not that.<eos> Oh, yes, that's for you.
- I'm here to see Madame Le Tellier.<eos> - Then give her a call.<eos> - No, it's OK.<eos> I know him.<eos> If I knew we would be talking about that troublesome little girl, I wouldn't have invited you in.
Okay, I promise. No more business.<eos> Okay. Here we go.<eos> Here we go. Just fun from now on.<eos> And this is on me because I'm ashamed I was late.<eos> And you know, I got a surprise for you tonight.
- It never happened, do you hear me?<eos> - Okay, it never happened.<eos> Bobby, say it like you mean it.<eos> I mean, that it never happened.<eos> Do you think that I'm doing a good job for you?
- Yes, October 3rd.<eos> We really hope you can join us. It would mean the world to us.<eos> We'll be there.<eos> Mijo!<eos> Nice to see you again.
The wound, doctor.<eos> Her musket backfired.<eos> I see no indication of a bite.<eos> That was never in question.<eos> I believe that these belong to you.
Oh, dear.<eos> Beg your pardon.<eos> Mr. wickham, you came.<eos> As I said I would.<eos> I feared that Mr. Darcy's presence would keep you away.
I think you and i understand each other, Liz Bennet.<eos> Well, the way you championed me earlier, i thought...<eos> Mr. Darcy's treatment of you has been utterly despicable, but...<eos> No more despicable than his treatment of you and your family.<eos> I don't understand you, sir.
One!<eos> Liz!<eos> Liz!<eos> Mr. Darcy.<eos> The very first moment i beheld you, my heart was irrevocably gone.
Ruins the lines of my suit.<eos> But, how about a crisp high five?<eos> Okay.<eos> Merry Christmas.<eos> And a convivial Tuesday in April to you too, Pool!
- Yeah, right here.<eos> You did this to yourself.<eos> - Small. - Yeah.<eos> It's my wife.<eos> Mr. Joyner, it is my legal obligation to inform you that you are now a part of a highly classified covert action.
- Who is?<eos> Pro-Dem guerrillas.<eos> El Toro.<eos> - They tried to hire me.<eos> - They tried to hire you?
-It's actually quite fascinating. -Oh, it's fascinating?<eos> Good.<eos> I'm glad my misery can be an upper for you, doc. -I didn't mean it that way.<eos> -Can you just give me a pill that'll make me a normal kind of human being going through puberty?<eos> That's all I need from you. That's why I'm here.
With Jack's face on them.<eos> Let them see what they've done.<eos> Jackie?<eos> Bobby.<eos> Sir, there's a car waiting on the tarmac to take you and Mrs. Kennedy to Bethesda.
I'll talk to her, but she makes the call.<eos> There's also the matter of the Oval.<eos> What do you want me to do first?<eos> Plan the funeral or pack the furniture?<eos> I know this is all delicate. That's why I'm approaching you.
What you are seeing is controlled anger tempered with icy detachment.<eos> It's one of the many subtle emotions of which a good actor is capable.<eos> Three weeks on location in Devon, followed by three in a London studio.<eos> There are currently only nine films in pre-production in British studios.<eos> None of the others holds a role for you.
Hell, y'all know how much I love to eat.<eos> You must be very proud of the book... to see all your faith rewarded.<eos> Our faith.<eos> It's our faith now, isn't it, Mr. Perkins?<eos> Tom couldn't have done it without you. That's not true.
It was a lovely sentiment... but what he was actually saying was, "Thank you and goodbye."<eos> I had served my purpose.<eos> And now, you have served yours. "Thank you and goodbye, Mr. Perkins."<eos> With respect, Mrs. Bernstein... you haven't the slightest notion of my relationship with Tom. - And in view of that...<eos> - He makes you do things... you never thought you'd do. He liberates you.
I don't think so.<eos> So... I don't exist anymore.<eos> I've been edited.<eos> I haven't quite decided who I'm going to shoot yet.<eos> Tom... myself... or you.
Get to the point.<eos> It means that the new commissioner will be able to access your husband's account in Switzerland.<eos> You have to trust me, or you'll lose everything.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> I'll see you out.
It's in Singapore.<eos> Is that safe?<eos> Yes.<eos> You're a smart man.<eos> Because you know that if they catch me, they'll go after you.
To stop bullets.<eos> Do you know anyone in Venezuela?<eos> My mother lives there.<eos> Why?<eos> The Spanish police are looking for you there too.
My mother lives there.<eos> Why?<eos> The Spanish police are looking for you there too.<eos> They've asked the Venezuelan police to collaborate.<eos> They want you dead or alive.
Here you go.<eos> The extradition papers signed by the Laotian government.<eos> If you've never been to Paris, you have a couple days to see it.<eos> You're flying to Laos next week.<eos> Here, this is for you.
Yes, sir, that FBI.<eos> This call is in regards to a Mr. Brian Curtis.<eos> Mr. Mercer, in accordance with section 25-B of the Patriot Act we now notify employers of their responsibilities and potential liabilities when convicted sex offenders change jobs.<eos> Yes, sir, a pedophile.<eos> Well, ignorance of the law doesn't relieve you of your legal obligations, sir, such as posting a sexual predator notice with his photo in a high traffic area, say a cafeteria or lobby.
Okay, yes, Sir, what vessel are you on, what's the name of your vessel?<eos> Coast Guard, District 8 Command Center, this is Lieutenant Degan speaking.<eos> An oil rig on fire?<eos> Sir, do you have a position for that?<eos> Sir, I'm not exactly sure, I need to get some information from you first if that's all right, can I get your name, please?
I don't know, but I bet you're gonna tell me.<eos> You pluck it out!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Mr. Red, when you moved your house outside of our village, did you notice that nobody tried to stop you?<eos> Birds, they may smile at you on the street, but that doesn't mean they like you.
- What do you think?<eos> This is work. I have to take it. I'm so sorry.<eos> This is David.<eos> This is Captain Santos in Baghdad checking on the delivery status of my Berettas.<eos> Captain, good to hear from you.
Look at this fucking place.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Excuse me, sir?<eos> What?<eos> There are some guys here to see you.
- Year anniversary's coming. My sister's now livin' in my house.<eos> How's it going with you, Bernie?<eos> That's enough, Carl. He did all he could.<eos> I am sorry, Mr. Nickerson.<eos> I didn't mean to upset you. Just wanted to ask Mr. Stello... about borrowing a boat.
Give me this.<eos> It's a bit late for target practice now, don't you think?<eos> Jump on it.<eos> You're kidding.<eos> No, I'm going to drag you.
Would you like a menu?<eos> Thank you very much. Could I have a cup of coffee, please?<eos> Sure.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Why does my father hate you so much?
Fine.<eos> Fausto, see if Dion needs anything.<eos> So, how've you been?<eos> Good.<eos> You?
No, what I would like is for Mr. Philips to come back here when it hasn't been raining for a few days, and the two of us can get up on that roof and see what's what.<eos> That way, once the situation's been thoroughly and properly assessed, then we can talk about hours and materials and scope of work in a manner that's not been pulled directly out of our asses.<eos> And what I'd also like is to agree on a deadline, which if not met, means revisiting the terms of our contract with the probability of penalties paid to us by you for each day of work exceeding the original agreement.<eos> Now, if that all sounds acceptable, I'll be happy to resume this conversation at a later date, but in the meantime, it was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Philips.<eos> And, um, my husband, David, will show you out.
- I'm doing very well sir, thank you.<eos> - Great and the business with your daughter?<eos> - All taken care of, can't thank you enough.<eos> - Good, good. If there's one thing we must do, it's take care of our young women.<eos> - Yes sir, is there something I can do for you?
I had a wife once.<eos> Had a family.<eos> Had some children, too.<eos> One time.<eos> Now the stitching'll outlast you, I imagine. That's...
You're the reason for this unification, all because you reached out to me at my private number.<eos> Your private number? General, I... I don't know your private number.<eos> Now you know.<eos> I do not claim to know how your mind works, but I believe it was important for you to see that.<eos> I called you, didn't I?
Hi. Sorry.<eos> Agent Miller?<eos> Hi.<eos> Paul Sevier, NSA.<eos> Nice to finally meet you in person.
I'm damn sure, but it is completely out of question.<eos> It's imperative that you relocate any surviving crew.<eos> I think you almost don't care.<eos> Of course I care about you, Bones.<eos> I always assumed that my respect for you is clear.
These old vessels were built in space. They were not supposed to take off from atmosphere.<eos> Let's get it out of here.<eos> They called this starship for a reason, captain.<eos> Why you tell me this now?<eos> Because I don't want disappoint you, you know in case you don't make it back
Fine.<eos> Everyone in this fucking house is crazy.<eos> Doctor Klein?<eos> Yeah, gimme a second.<eos> Yeah, I wanted to talk to you about the email you sent.
All the rooms?<eos> Yeah.<eos> How do we start?<eos> We make the house dumb.<eos> Okay, Mr. Regan, the first thing we do is sterilize you and your family.
Apparently spied on female co-workers and ex-girlfriends.<eos> - Works as an independent IT tech. Seven, eight companies.<eos> No job lasts more than a couple of months.<eos> Then hired by you.<eos> Lucky you.
I'm hurt pretty bad, can you please come?<eos> 422 147th Street.<eos> - I have...<eos> - Please come, please!<eos> I have someone coming to you.
I do have a copy of Lloyd Wright's "Disappearing City."<eos> I've got that.<eos> In fact, I have a 1932 first edition.<eos> I could try to find it.<eos> Do you want me to order it for you?
I could try to find it.<eos> Do you want me to order it for you?<eos> Uh, yes. I would, thanks.<eos> Just fill in your name and address.<eos> Do you own this bookstore?
Shut your tiny mouth now!<eos> Sir, I got the bad guy.<eos> That's my job.<eos> Your job is putting tickets on parked cars!<eos> Chief, Mrs. Otterton's here to see you again.
- 10 fingers, see.<eos> - If there is going to be a criminal...<eos> The night is here.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Don't I know you...
Take the stairs.<eos> It's not a long way up.<eos> Ring the doorbell at 501.<eos> There's a man, Hassan, he'll show you everything.<eos> I'll be with you shortly.
Looks like he accessed our phone tracking software.<eos> Dr. Franks.<eos> - Hello?<eos> - It's Quaker.<eos> Jerico's on his way to you.
I'm learning so much from your journal, sir.<eos> It's men like you we academics rely on.<eos> The honest amateur is our foot soldier.<eos> Only do not let his dogma infect you.<eos> Please, its for you.
- This is my cave. - Get out!<eos> Go on!<eos> Typical crackpot nonsense, allowing a childplay in here.<eos> This child made the discovery.<eos> Whereas you, sir, no one invited you here.
West Front surrenders!<eos> Victory over France!<eos> The French are defeated!<eos> Good morning, Judge Fromm. Yeah!<eos> There's nothing for you today.
A letter from the military postal service.<eos> - Typed.<eos> - Who?<eos> Quangel's son.<eos> Herr Quangel, for you.
Just a moment.<eos> Operator speaking.<eos> Incoming call from the Lothringer Street section.<eos> Reported arrest of suspect in the Hobgoblin case.<eos> Yes, I'll put you through.
I'm very sorry.<eos> Professor Langdon, the headaches are going to be intense initially.<eos> And you can also expect nausea, confusion and dizziness.<eos> That was the front desk.<eos> The police are here to see you.
Okay. We'll call the U.S. Consulate instead if you like.<eos> Just wait.<eos> Just give me... Give me a minute.<eos> Get ahold of things.<eos> Why was someone shooting at you?
Very, very sorry.<eos> "very Sorry"?<eos> Do you have any idea why you'd be saying this?<eos> No.<eos> Why was someone shooting at you?
Professor Langdon ?<eos> Hello, yes.<eos> Speaking.<eos> Thank heavens you're alive.<eos> We've been looking for you.
The hospital scenario encouraged you to trust Dr. Brooks.<eos> And your call to the consulate was answered by our man.<eos> Professor Langdon?<eos> Thank heavens you're alive.<eos> We've been looking for you.
Professor Langdon?<eos> Thank heavens you're alive.<eos> We've been looking for you.<eos> Are you still in possession?<eos> You had the pointer and we had you.
Thank heavens you're alive.<eos> We've been looking for you.<eos> Are you still in possession?<eos> You had the pointer and we had you.<eos> It was all working seamlessly until Miss Brooks stole you away.
I was not trying to steal anything.<eos> Your security system is atrocious.<eos> The firewall is outdated.<eos> The software I created Was able to put a virus in the system very easily.<eos> That is, it does not look good to you if an 18 year old Was able to break into the bank and steal all this information.
Can I help you, sir?<eos> No, I was just... I was just waiting.<eos> Hi.<eos> What brings you here?<eos> Same as you.
I really don't have a preference.<eos> You prefer strudel, huh, honey?<eos> Strudel it is.<eos> Well, sit down, Mr. Scamander.<eos> We're not gonna poison you.
I'm sorry, Ma.<eos> I didn't realize it was so late.<eos> - I was watching you at dinner.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> People like you, don't they, Mr. Kowalski? Oh.
The ACARS data was wrong.<eos> I'd like to add something on a personal note.<eos> I can say with absolute confidence that after speaking with the rest of the flight crew, with bird experts, aviation engineers, after running through every scenario, after interviewing each player, there is still an "X" in this result<eos> and it's you, Captain Sullenberger.<eos> Remove you from the equation, and the math just fails.
Thank you.<eos> We didn't want to leave it too long before Ruth could see her new home.<eos> What would you like to drink, Mrs Khama?<eos> Gin and lime would be lovely.<eos> We have lemonade for you, Mr Khama.
Defiance.<eos> The knowledge that one day things will change because they have to.<eos> And it has to start somewhere.<eos> Mrs Khama... how nice to see you again.<eos> You too.
Enjoy the film.<eos> I have some rather good news for you.<eos> A word after the film.<eos> Mr Khama, don't you want to hear the good news?<eos> We have tickets for you.
Might I suggest a glass of sherry?<eos> Splendid idea.<eos> The government will release this white paper.<eos> It explains the situation and your succession.<eos> It sets out in fairly plain English that were it not for our intervention, Bechuanaland would have been torn apart by the rivalry between you and your uncle.
I know what you and your sons are up to.<eos> Please do tell.<eos> Oh, like I said, feel free to look around.<eos> As much as you can without a warrant.<eos> Then if there's nothing else, I'll see you out.
Do you think, maybe, you could reach the ledge?<eos> That ledge?<eos> That's a heck of a trunk you've got there!<eos> Thanks a lot, kid!<eos> Uh, Mr. Moon? My name is Meena, and I baked a cake for you and, uh, I was wondering if you'd, maybe, give me a second chance to...
I don't understand.<eos> Come on, let's get out of here.<eos> Mr. Moon?<eos> Meena, please...<eos> I baked a cake for you 'cause...
What's the good news?<eos> We have 20 free tickets for our listeners.<eos> Who ever is the first to answer my question correctly... wins a free show ticket.<eos> My question follows straight after this beautiful song.<eos> - How can I help you?
Where were you between 10 and 10.30 this morning?<eos> - I was at home.<eos> - And who were you with?<eos> I was alone.<eos> Did anyone see you at home?
Your first name is James?<eos> The receipt for your gear.<eos> Bird costume?<eos> I didn't write it.<eos> I'm not here to judge you.
What.<eos> What are you doing...?<eos> Hey. I'm-I'm-I'm Peter.<eos> - Tony.<eos> - What are... What are you-What are you- What are you doing here?
There you go. He's slower.<eos> A tenth of a second slower, Jesse. Two-tenths, Coach.<eos> Mmm-hmm.<eos> Relax.<eos> I won't let you down in front of Cromwell.
Maybe.<eos> But you gotta let me make it on my own.<eos> You don't have to decide anything just yet, but at least do the trials.<eos> Give yourself the option.<eos> It has been quite a day for you here in New York, Mr. Owens.
It's very nice. Really.<eos> You can always call me. If anything changes.<eos> Or about something else.<eos> Goodbye, gentlemen.<eos> I'll come with you, Mr Schollaert.
Listen, I just got a phone call from your grandparents.<eos> Apparently, they don't love the idea of you riding on this bus for three days.<eos> They asked me if I'd give you a lift.<eos> Meanwhile, I was headed that way so I told them, shit, why not?<eos> Sir, I don't know you.
This here...<eos> This is my town.<eos> Anybody who don't know it, you better take notice.<eos> Now you gonna face me like a man or what?<eos> No offense, mister, I don't know you and I don't think nothin' cross about you. But that shot is on the house if you will get outta here.
No.<eos> Now we've got that out of the way, perhaps we could discuss the operational details of the next 72 hours?<eos> So, this is gonna be a standard "blue-dye" procedure, blue dye being...<eos> I know what a "blue-dye" is.<eos> Tonight, you will receive a telephone call at exactly 2307.
You know why that's worth 68 grand?<eos> Because it has a reputation. It has a name brand. It has an identity.<eos> We get a case like this, a litigation at this level, I need lawyers who kill.<eos> Lawyers with reputations walk into a courtroom and intimidate.<eos> I don't see you in that picture, Mr. Cahill.
Probably call you.<eos> You know, here's someone like you been through so much, a major tragedy, unthinkable... but you come out the other side.<eos> Many people wouldn't have made it.<eos> I knew that about you. I knew it before you came into my office.<eos> I might have not let you in otherwise.
- What is it?<eos> - I picked up the kids from school.. ..and dropped madam at the Yoga centre.<eos> Broccoli was out of stock, so I got cauliflower instead.<eos> I've kept the baby powder in the car.<eos> White for you and pink for ma'am.
You don't have to yell. I'm reading, fuckface.<eos> - It's for the fucking camera.<eos> - I'm trying to fucking...<eos> I'm letting everyone else hear it, okay?<eos> It's not just for you, mister entitled.
She's worried.<eos> How long you been holed up here?<eos> Since I got out.<eos> I went to your flat.<eos> They put you in hospital and tried to frame me for murder.
My name is Brandon Jensen... Jensen. Yeah.<eos> Yeah, hold on one second.<eos> All righty, uh...<eos> Awesome.<eos> This is for you.
I appreciate it.<eos> No problem, I didn't do much.<eos> I nearly caught him, but he took off so fast.<eos> In high school, I ran the 1,000 meters in 2'42".<eos> Perhaps his speed shows how scared he was of you.
- And you? Buy Bonne Vie.<eos> They're made in Florange.<eos> Evening, Michèle.<eos> How's your knee?<eos> And you? Your hand?
He served me well during the Clone Wars and has lived in hiding since the Emperor's purge.<eos> Yes, I will send for him.<eos> You'll need someone you can trust.<eos> I would trust her with my life.<eos> - Captain Antilles, I have a mission for you. - Senator.
And I still love my daughter ri--<eos> Maybe I shouldn't be saying this, but...<eos> I love her right now more than ever.<eos> - I hurt for her more now--<eos> - I don't blame you... Mr. Levov.
Surely, you can now tell me something about Merry.<eos> - I surely cannot.<eos> - I would like to speak with her.<eos> Well, she wouldn't like to speak with you.<eos> She hates you.
It's over.<eos> You made this up?<eos> Okay, yes.<eos> I made up a mission.<eos> But that's because I wanted to make sure it would work before I brought it to you.
You liked the book?<eos> Yes.<eos> It's a book of love.<eos> Yes, a love story.<eos> This is for you.
This is for you.<eos> What is it?<eos> Take it. It's for you.<eos> I didn't read that.<eos> It's for you.
Where?<eos> Where we'll be.<eos> You'll be unhappy.<eos> Why choose to be unhappy?<eos> I don't love you. I'll never love you.
Still... I'll take them.<eos> You've come to visit the general? Yes.<eos> Your name?<eos> Colonel Lebedev is my name.<eos> I can't find you here for some reason.
-Cured beef, salami...<eos> -Sausages.<eos> Sausages.<eos> And... a diet one, with corn.<eos> Apart from you, who else has keys from this apartment?
I'll take her clinical record with me, if you do not object.<eos> Of course, you may.<eos> And if you remember any details or something unusual, please contact me.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll see you off.
A social call?<eos> Yeah, of course, just to wish you the compliments of the season.<eos> Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas.<eos> Merry Christmas. Thank God that's over.<eos> Now, Inspector, what strange happening compels you to my door, but embarrasses you to relate?
Very good, sir.<eos> And when will you be seeing her?<eos> Now, listen...<eos> Oh, I nearly forgot, sir.<eos> A telegram came for you.
Man's gotta stay awake on the job after all.<eos> - Why, have you been keeping late nights?<eos> - But, now that you've been promoted, maybe you ought to start thinking about settling down.<eos> - Me, you kidding?<eos> - Sergeant meadows, a lady's here to see you.
Would you rather my predecessor was still in charge?<eos> The only people he welcomed were the communists.<eos> Or perhaps you would rather we send all our cobalt, copper and uranium to the USSR?<eos> Of course not, General.<eos> It's just you haven't been elected to the office you claim to hold.
We can make it a lot worse.<eos> There's talk of a court martial for cowardice.<eos> Do it.<eos> I don't care.<eos> Not just for you.
Did you bring the knife with you?<eos> No. Got it from his kitchen.<eos> A five-inch steak knife, according to the police report.<eos> And you were arrested in the same manner on September 20th, 2012, in possession of another steak knife.<eos> Did you bring that one with you?
Have George come in please.<eos> Security?<eos> That's a first.<eos> Not everybody needs a gun to get things done.<eos> What else can I do for you today, special agent?
For fuck sakes, man.<eos> What's up?<eos> They lost James.<eos> Goddammit.<eos> This came for you, sir.
The old EVA helmets used to burn like that...<eos> The contacts would cook your skin.<eos> I had to let that stinking animal Kothari go, since you weren't interested in him.<eos> We're going to have a nice long talk, you and I.<eos> How long, depends on you.
The Donnager and the Cant were attacked by the same class of stealth warships.<eos> You will have to testify.<eos> Testify?<eos> To the UN Security Council.<eos> You mean the one that you and the OPA aren't allowed into?
You took an innocent kid and you forced her to do your dirty work. No!<eos> She came to me. Asked me to help her.<eos> She knew what she was doing.<eos> She was willing to make a sacrifice for us.<eos> It's more than you.
Do you know it is possible to cry so hard that your tears turn to blood?<eos> And living with this pain, I came to realize that I have millions of brothers and sisters in the Belt.<eos> I even count you among them.<eos> As I did Julie, an Earther.<eos> So, everybody dies for the cause, except for you.
You think you've won?<eos> Not yet.<eos> But we are getting closer, huh?<eos> I was never fighting against you, Miller.<eos> In fact I was fighting for you.
Not me.<eos> If you could choose anybody in the world to be your dad, anybody.<eos> - Anyone?<eos> - Anybody, dead or alive.<eos> You.
These cupcakes are killing me. I am totally not able to get the cupcake experiment on.<eos> I work in a cannery and I got a special knife to gut fish.<eos> Well, that is interesting.<eos> It's like bird cupcake factory time.<eos> Listen, can I call you back in a minute?
Prince Kipiani.<eos> Prince Kipiani.<eos> You must go and look at our gardens after dinner, Ali Khan.<eos> We have the most beautiful ancient trees.<eos> Thank you, Your Highness, but I came to visit you, not your trees.
I will.<eos> I will, Ali.<eos> Khan.<eos> Khan.<eos> A telegram for you.
Thanks to us.<eos> I don't know what we'd do without them.<eos> - Captain mainwaring.<eos> Ah! Morning, vicar.<eos> Telephone for you.
Second group, ready!<eos> It's a privilege to watch you all.<eos> They're a decent bunch.<eos> We do what we can.<eos> They'd clearly do anything for you.
How do you do?<eos> I read your column.<eos> It's great fun.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - What brings you here?
Thank you.<eos> Voilà.<eos> I just need the ticket.<eos> It's both or neither, Mr Wilson.<eos> Then I'll trouble you no more.
- Yes.<eos> - I'm very fond of you, Cosmé.<eos> I think of you as a chum.<eos> Oh!<eos> That's kind of you, Mr Bayfield.
That's such a pretty melody.<eos> Is it yours?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Oh.<eos> You inspire me. I shall write some lyrics for you.
Thank you very much.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - A-ha.<eos> - Ah, Mr Bayfield, how good to see you.<eos> And you, Mr Totten.
Cosmé!<eos> Where have you been?<eos> I got jumped by a bunch of sailors.<eos> They were most disrespectful.<eos> Let's straighten you up.
- What?<eos> - That's a great deal of money.<eos> - I know the reason why.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> What was the high point of the evening for you, Mr Bayfield?
- I know the reason why.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> What was the high point of the evening for you, Mr Bayfield?<eos> I'm sorry, Baroness, what did you say?<eos> What was the high point of the evening for you?
This all just feels like... Something that happens to other people.<eos> Yeah, well, now you're other people to other people.<eos> All right, we have two burgers, two fries, and two cokes.<eos> It'll be about five minutes, we'll bring it right out to you.<eos> Hi. What can I get you?
At first glance?<eos> Are you saying I didn't see what I saw?<eos> No.<eos> But first glances are for strangers and shock is just for passers-by, for people who don't know Susan, or love her.<eos> But if you bring her home and bring her up with your other children, she'll become as familiar and as beautiful to you as they are.
He said, "Oh, God. Another one."<eos> "Another one"?<eos> He's had nothing to do with Susan.<eos> She was born here, in the maternity home.<eos> That's why I thought I ought to come to you.
You do, indeed.<eos> But the honor is all mine, Lieutenant.<eos> I do so treasure any opportunity to aid one of the king's officers, especially in these difficult times.<eos> How may I be of assistance to you?<eos> This is for you, Your Grace, from my commander.
I don't even like these niggas, man.<eos> I'm sorry about your window.<eos> Here.<eos> - For what?<eos> - For you.
I can get you that.<eos> You ain't got to wet dream about Doc Connors.<eos> You want extra shit?<eos> I'll get you that, too.<eos> This about me fighting for you?
I wouldn't say that anything like this has happened before.<eos> Really, Marcus, you don't have to do that, calling me sir.<eos> Call me Dean Caudwell, or call me Dean, if you like.<eos> Winesburg isn't a military academy.<eos> I don't mind calling you "sir", Dean.
Move, move, move!<eos> Out of the way!<eos> Federal agent, move!<eos> Take a team to the northeast elevator. I'll meet you up there.<eos> Bourne's on his way up to you.
You're accusing me of stealing your tools?<eos> No.<eos> Yes.<eos> Walter. Don't let him smoke you.<eos> Sir, we have evidence that, if true... you know, indicts you, more or less.
You're welcome to.<eos> I'll sleep in the barn.<eos> Mr. Bohannon...<eos> I'm sorry about supper.<eos> Should've seen it'd be hard on you, but it's been so long...
He's it, not me.<eos> Ms. Strobridge. Take your brood inside for a moment.<eos> Anything you gotta say to me, you can say to us.<eos> Well, I think it'd be better if we spoke in private.<eos> Better for you, or better for us, Mr. Huntington?
They did it.<eos> How are you feeling right about now?<eos> For the record, of course.<eos> Like it's over.<eos> Does that make you happy or sad?
No, they're a hound with a scent.<eos> Once they've chewed through Durant, they'll come sniffing after us.<eos> I'm ahead of that problem.<eos> It was you, lit that little bonfire in the C.P. Depot last night, huh?<eos> I got something for you.
Do you wish to be saved?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thomas Durant will invoke his fifth amendment right as secured by the constitution of the United States.<eos> Mr. Durant, we have sworn testimony corroborating the charges against you, am I clear you are choosing to let these charges go unanswered by you here today?
Why?<eos> Kayoco Anne-Patterson, Special Presidential Envoy , Kayoco Anne-Patterson, Special Presidential Envoy I read your administrations reports.<eos> I need a person I can work with.<eos> Someone with an interesting history.<eos> That's you.
You next?<eos> No way.<eos> I'm thinking 10 years.<eos> If Japan's still around, run for office.<eos> I'll support you... in exchange for a party secretary post.
- Come and see for yourself.<eos> - I-I like this spot.<eos> It affords you a 360-degree view of your surroundings, and it's not patrolled by Boston cops.<eos> Well, you're a... doctor.<eos> You should know that sunshine is good for you.
You're not in the burger business.<eos> You're in the real estate business.<eos> You don't build an empire off a 1.4 percent cut of a 15-cent hamburger.<eos> You build it by owning the land upon which that burger is cooked.<eos> What you ought to be doing is buying up plots of land then turning around and leasing said plots to franchisees who as a condition of their deal, should be permitted to lease from you and you alone.
You need to watch that, it's a big contributing factor.<eos> So as I said, your kidney function is currently at 50 percent.<eos> 18 months ago, it was 65.<eos> Any lower, and you're at serious risk for kidney failure.<eos> Okay, I'm going to check on you later.
Hmm. Let me remember.<eos> Well, maybe I can help.<eos> The blood was handed to you at the Rockingham scene while you were examining that scene, correct?<eos> Yes, that's actually true.<eos> So, Mr. Simpson's blood was literally handed to you by LAPD at the very location where you found evidence of his blood on the carpet, in the driveway, in his socks?
Good afternoon, Your Honor.<eos> You are reminded, Detective, that you are still under oath.<eos> - Mr. Cochran, you may proceed.<eos> - Thank you, Your Honor.<eos> Detective Fuhrman, was the testimony you gave at the preliminary hearing in this case completely truthful?
Why the hell'd you give me a puppy?<eos> I don't know, I just, uh... just wanted to make sure you always had a friend.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You've been called the architect of the defense team.<eos> You were the first one hired by O.J. Simpson. It was the day after the murders.
Who I love.<eos> And I got close.<eos> In the bleak midwinter...<eos> At some point in the near future Mr Churchill will want to speak to you in person, Mr Shelby.<eos> He has a job for you.
It was just some girl.<eos> She have a name?<eos> Her, her name is Brooke.<eos> Cute?<eos> Little young for you, doctor.
Saved you the trouble of burying him.<eos> Fiddler! Fiddler!<eos> Massa Waller, Massa Waller.<eos> Can I talk to you about Toby?<eos> He had to know the African would escape while he was playing for you at your party.
He wants to marry us both off.<eos> Pierre, Helene... Congratulations!<eos> - What's happened?<eos> - We're engaged.<eos> I have to tell you that the Minister of War is very busy and may not be able to see you this evening.
- Yes. There are many stories told of that action.<eos> Perhaps. But the stories told by the men who were actually there, under enemy fire, in the thick of it, are a different thing to the stories told by fellows on the staff who get rewards for doing nothing.<eos> And you consider me one of those, do you?<eos> I'm not talking about you.<eos> I don't know you and I don't wish to.
We'll make it a formal arrangement as part of the... bigger deal between us.<eos> I will have an office there.<eos> Some devil gets into you, doesn't it, boy?<eos> Mr Shelby, if I want to play the squire in your place of false charity then I will.<eos> Ambition for respectability doesn't make you a saint. Am I wrong?
Peaky fucking Blinders, my arse.<eos> Is he afraid?<eos> No.<eos> Sit.<eos> I'm talking to you, Mr Shelby.
Maraigh.<eos> Come on, you say it.<eos> If you wanted me dead, I'd be dead, wouldn't I?<eos> It's true.<eos> It's true, we do need you alive.
I'm like a telegram.<eos> "A telegram"?<eos> I don't think your English is so good.<eos> Or maybe you should listen more carefully to what I have to say.<eos> I have a message for you, Mr Shelby.
She knows my diary.<eos> Fuck me, Tom, I don't know how you do it.<eos> - Mr Shelby?<eos> - Yes!<eos> Oh! Your little boy looks so much like you.
No! You said you were innocent, and you were.<eos> I'm glad.<eos> I guess I owe you an apology.<eos> No. You were doing your duty.<eos> Can't fault you for that.
I believe you ran Pinewood Farms.<eos> I believe you've restarted the program, and I would like to know...<eos> Why are you really here, Mr. Gordon?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> This whole city has turned its back on you, despite you risking your life to save it over and over again.
I think you're gonna love these.<eos> I really buttered them up.<eos> Wow, thank you so much.<eos> Uh, before I leave, um, I should tell you, you're both great applicants, but I've decided to rent the apartment to someone else.<eos> I smiled at you.
Wow, look at that.<eos> What a great magazine.<eos> Sir, if you're interested, the new issue of "Clown Boobies"<eos> just came in.<eos> I can unpack the box for you.
Just translate.<eos> I remember, he said he wanted you to have exactly what you asked for.<eos> Hey, cat freak, I didn't call you down here to ignore me.<eos> Could we have a moment of privacy, please?<eos> You and the cat? - Yeah. - Okay.
Would you like some tea?<eos> - No. Thank you.<eos> Have some.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Mr. Katiyal, this is what I can do for you.
Carried through to you in a smolder.<eos> O my Lord!<eos> I have scratched the threshold of madness.<eos> O my Lord!<eos> Mr. Frost, how are you?
My dear Count Bezukhov, how very good of you to come along to my little salon, when you must still be feeling so acutely the death of your poor father.<eos> Well, yes, but I hardly knew him.<eos> Mostly, I feel embarrassed by my good luck in inheriting such a great fortune, I've done nothing to deserve it.<eos> Ah, now, Count. There you are, too modest.<eos> The very fact that your father singled you out for greatness shows that you must have exceptional qualities, which I discovered for myself long since.
You know what I mean?<eos> I mean, people got to like your ass.<eos> Look... Look at Lee Russell over there.<eos> He laughing it up with them teachers.<eos> Now, how come the teachers never invite you to eat lunch?
- Mm! Now, North Jackson's not the newest school Mm-hmm.<eos> in the district, but it is to me hands down the most charming.<eos> Even more charming now that you're here, Dr. Brown. - Oh-ho-ho! - Oh!<eos> Why thank you, Mr. Russell.<eos> Flattery will get you everywhere.
Uh, okay, ma'am, well, I'll...<eos> I'll be sure to take care of it.<eos> We won't have to worry about this problem ever again.<eos> Well, you've done a piss-poor job so far.<eos> Are you in charge or discipline or aren't ya?
Mr Pine.<eos> I would like you to bring a Scotch and soda to my room please.<eos> I can ask room service, or there should be a minibar just under the main wardrobe.<eos> I know where the minibar is.<eos> I want you.
They're one of the most famous families in the city.<eos> No. Was burglar.<eos> Crazy burglar.<eos> What are you talking about? Why would a burglar do that?<eos> What do you care?
Got it. 43rd floor.<eos> Someone's contacted the president's staff.<eos> Someone's watching him.<eos> Dr. Osmond, what is it you want from us?<eos> I think it's more about what Hanka Robotics can do for you.
Three flashbangs, two bullets, and one body bag later, we took custody of the device.<eos> We must have over 100 redundancies in place to prevent some punk with a laptop from hijacking satellites.<eos> And Pandora's Box can bypass all of them.<eos> With the push of a button, it can eavesdrop on secure communications, corrupt military software, transmit false intelligence, or crash a satellite out of the sky like a goddamn tactical warhead.<eos> One of you is behind this.
Who knows what that girl will do to herself?<eos> We don't, because we don't know anything about her.<eos> She's temperamental.<eos> She hasn't had a drink and now she's puked up mini hotdogs.<eos> Do none of you care that that girl is obviously pregnant?
I cried so hard Teddy gave me his.<eos> He was always good like that.<eos> Francie, we should go. Okay.<eos> Thanks again for coming, everyone.<eos> It wouldn't have been the same without you.
Attention.<eos> Tomorrow the evacuation of the ghetto will begin.<eos> Pack your belongings, and prepare for resettlement.<eos> And now, listen to an old story.<eos> I wrote it for you.
I, I'm not one to complain, normally, but this basket's full of heads.<eos> Final words of Carina Smyth.<eos> The final words of Carina Smyth, who says, I'm not a witch.<eos> But I forgive your common dim wittedness and feeble brains.<eos> In short, most of you have the mind of a goat.
I live in a tormented state now knowing of all the pain and suffering that I have created.<eos> That's something I will live with for the rest of my life.<eos> People have accused me of being silent and not being sympathetic.<eos> That is not true. I apologize to my victims.<eos> I will turn and face you.
Are you sure about this, my Lord?<eos> Listen to me, woman. I need you to do as I tell you.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I need to get you and the boy away from here.<eos> And I'll join you as soon as I can.
This is how sex slavery starts, honey.<eos> I'm so sorry. Listen, no.<eos> You don't have to worry about that.<eos> Those kinds of people want young, beautiful females.<eos> You're safe.
- Okay.. okay.<eos> Enough of this!<eos> I don't care!<eos> I'm leaving!<eos> With or without you! I'm leaving!
DELIVER HIM TO ME!<eos> Hello?<eos> She's out!<eos> She has the dagger.<eos> We thinks she is coming to you, so are we.
Wixler kept a box. To meet the retirement plans concluded Prior to merger, Which would eventually unite With the new pension fund.<eos> Heaven forbid, can you speak clearly?<eos> With the cessation of US operations, There is no longer any financial responsibility for SIMTEC.<eos> The retirement fund will be dissolved.<eos> With all my respect, "Donald" 30 years of hard work Does not mean anything to you!

- No, Mr. Doyle.<eos> - Right answer.<eos> I wouldn't let it happen.<eos> And it's not gonna happen, right?<eos> Thankfully for you two,
Trainspotting?<eos> In Leith Central?<eos> "He says, laughing.<eos> "I noticed Begbie seemed strangely subdued and uncomfortable."<eos> They fucking turn it on for you. Fucking shitbag!
And I'm Sarayu.<eos> Sarah who?<eos> Sarayu. It means "a breath of wind."<eos> Right.<eos> So... which one of you is...
Action.<eos> The breath of life.<eos> She is my spirit.<eos> Love is meant to exist within a relationship, Mack.<eos> That's all we wanna have with you.
It's gonna run out any minute.<eos> I'm going to send down extra air tanks.<eos> But, Kate, there's a reason that I didn't do this before.<eos> Moving onto a second tank is going to increase your chance of nitrogen narcosis dramatically.<eos> You're going to need to watch each other closely to make sure that neither of you is behaving strangely or hallucinating.
So, for this morning's thought of the day, we will be discussing with you future planning.<eos> Now, as you know, many of the top here will be, uh, taking their exams soon.<eos> Much sooner than many of them would like. - Hey, yo, that's you.<eos> - But it's always at this... Shh!<eos> It's always at this time of year, as we prepare to say bye-bye to some of you, that my thoughts turn to... to what lies ahead of us on the road to...
How many morons with stinking breath who refuse to do anything about it?<eos> How many...<eos> How many constant whiners, complainers, rapists, embezzlers, liars, thieves, dirty politicians, cheaters?<eos> It could be your mother, could be your brother.<eos> You, for example. How many of you would be happy if some of your friends were gone tomorrow?
For Michael.<eos> It might be a break for Michael. He puts on a brave face, but children need a stable home.<eos> Hey, listen. Listen, Paul.<eos> My son and I were about to sit down to eat.<eos> There's not enough food to ask you to stay, but...
Shit!<eos> Welcome back.<eos> I was starting to think I was gonna have to tell... that nice little girl out in the waiting room... her daddy's gone.<eos> I'd always hoped... that I'd get the chance to meet someone like you.<eos> There's so few of you left.
Can you get the table runner from the hall closet, and just put it on the side table.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Sorry.<eos> David.<eos> God, between you and Carla, you're gonna give me a heart attack.
I'm back to needing a straight answer from one of you two.<eos> Right.<eos> Let me bottom-line this for you.<eos> Someone's going down for this.<eos> I'm firing one of you two today.
Well, all right. I may be just a teacher, but I'm pretty sure that qualifies me to ask a goddamn question about something that's gonna affect my ability to fucking teach!<eos> Campbell, get your ass out of here while you still got a job!<eos> No, I can't do it, man, because I'm done listening to you.<eos> And I know I'm just a teacher, but that ought to be worth something around here.<eos> In fact, that ought to be worth everything to you guys, but instead, you treat us like shit.
We do not need the reliquary<eos> Only what's inside it.<eos> I will carry it.<eos> I will carry the relic.<eos> One of you will have to free Ciarán.
Go home.<eos> I'm sorry, [stammers] he just morphed.<eos> He did it. You saw it, right?<eos> [Zordon] Do it again.<eos> All of you. Any of you.
We don't know.<eos> No, Red.<eos> You don't know!<eos> But guess what?<eos> One of you does.
I'm going to share something with you now, something personal and of importance to me.<eos> I have a need to confess, but you, I think, might have a need to forget.<eos> By the end of this, you'll be free to go, and don't worry, by the time you're back in the outside world, you will not remember any of what you've heard.<eos> Ignorance is bliss. Well, what's wrong with bliss?<eos> Some of you know each other and some of you don't.

What were you about to say to Drax before I walked out?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Your quarters are this way.<eos> We deliver you to the Kree in the morning.<eos> Neither one of you will last much longer after that.
You are wasting a lot of time here!<eos> We're all gonna die.<eos> Rear thrusters are out again!<eos> We're done for without that generator!<eos> Guardians... perhaps it will provide you solace... that your deaths are not without purpose.
Fucking idiot.<eos> You look amazing!<eos> Johnny.<eos> You're skating on thin ice. Watch out you don't fall in and drown.<eos> Don't worry. I'm not here to put you to sleep with some corporate speech like my boring sister might have.
But he should never have been gambling like that.<eos> I'm gonna pay you back.<eos> Now, at my bank, where we make less than one percent interest on what little money we have, people would be turning cartwheels just to get 25 percent interest on any loan, and that is what I'm generously gonna give to you right now,<eos> $25,000.<eos> That is my first, last, and only offer to you.
"Cooper. Cooper." Right before his head disappeared.<eos> It was something like no one has ever seen before.<eos> I've never seen anything like it.<eos> I... I've never... I've...<eos> You don't know. You weren't there.
She's lucky she has such a talented bodyguard.<eos> She's fine now.<eos> Could this good and faithful servant ask for one more favor?<eos> What do you want?<eos> Which one of you hit Joy Meachum?
- I don't know that I do, either.<eos> - Claire, please.<eos> They killed friends of mine and you knew that.<eos> And that is why I couldn't tell you.<eos> Either of you.

The same way the woman couldn't save the architect.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Have I gotten in your head the same way he did long ago?<eos> What about the ones you still love?<eos> What will become of them once you are gone?
It's pretty elemental. Jared will be doing your training.<eos> I oversee the team, and Jared oversees the unit.<eos> As you know, you'll be doing straight up customer maintenance for the smaller advertisers.<eos> You work in your portable here.<eos> It's gonna match the customer experience, and it gets routed over to one of you.
- Right. That's you. Get up.<eos> - Come on, guppies, just stand up.<eos> Guppies, stand up, come on. Congratulations.<eos> Nice to have you.<eos> Now, now, guppies is just an affectionate term for you baby fishies.
Anyway. All right, this is Dream Friday, the latest in our long tradition of presenting our newest innovations.<eos> The first Dream Friday featured Ty Lafitte, the inventor of TrueYou and our founding father.<eos> And usually, we feature one of our engineers or our visionaries, but today, unfortunately, it's just me, and for that, I apologize in advance.<eos> - We love you, Eamon! - Thanks, Mom.<eos> Now, you might not have seen me around campus for the last few days, and maybe you're wondering just where the heck I've been.
Oh, did you think this was just a camera?<eos> No.<eos> Welcome to real-time analytic processing.<eos> When you see this, you're also getting this.<eos> Air quality, traffic volume, weather patterns, biometrics, facial recognition, saved and searchable, all to serve you better.
Without secrets, without the hoarding of knowledge and information, we can finally realize our potential.<eos> This is a special Dream Friday.<eos> I thought I'd change it up a bit today and not have a speech, but an interview.<eos> I had a conversation with a young Circler the other day that I wanted to share with you.<eos> I've asked Mae Holland, who some of you might know is one of our new guppies in Customer Experience, to join me today.
If you're enjoying this, I'm worried about you.<eos> Good night, everyone.<eos> I'm not gonna lie, it was a crazy day, but I'm happy I had you with me, each and every one of you.<eos> Never a boring day here.<eos> A lot of you guys have been asking me about this sculpture, which is a treat for me. I finally get to use my art history degree.
You are not listening to me, Irish!<eos> Scottish.<eos> It's Irish if I say it's Irish and if you can't listen to me, you can't hear what these horses have to say and that makes you no damn good to me.<eos> - Got it? - Got it.<eos> But first you're gonna do chores to get them used to you.
The giving gal award goes to a woman who last year, generously donated over $1 million to the president lieutenant's project.<eos> Mrs. Meredith parish.<eos> Thank you, Charlotte.<eos> And it is my pleasure to serve.<eos> I just hope that i can inspire you all to give of yourselves.
Yeah, it's about this.<eos> A two-dollar scratcher lottery ticket.<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Y-You've hired an arbitration attorney to figure out which of you is entitled to a two-dollar scratcher?
Promise.<eos> The very foundation upon which this group rests, eh?<eos> - And that hope belongs to me.<eos> It belongs to me, you son of a bitch! Please, stop.<eos> Each of you will have an opportunity to plead your case.
This is sexy.<eos> Oh, stop, sto...<eos> Oh, you know what?<eos> You might want to check your programs 'cause I'm bad dad now.<eos> I'll take you to your goddamn room.
It was a goof.<eos> You guys were supposed to give valentine's cards to each other, but instead you were just sticking hate mail in a suggestion box covered in hearts.<eos> I'll give it to you, though... it got a little nasty at the end.<eos> A-A little bit nasty?<eos> One of you put anthrax in the box.
- something that Dennis doesn't have.<eos> - Right, that's true.<eos> And so that's why he hates Valentine's Day so much.<eos> But he's entrusted me, because I'm a gay man<eos> - and clearly more sensitive than the rest of you,
- You did?<eos> - Yeah-huh.<eos> - Charlie.<eos> Well...<eos> - Well, it's for both of you guys, but, these,
A magician never reveals his tricks, Cricks.<eos> Yeah. We did put that pet-tracking device in him. Well, wait.<eos> Don't tell him that.<eos> Did you put a chip in...?<eos> Hey, listen, um, we got a job for you, buddy.
Well, I guess you're gonna need someone to write your will.<eos> No way!<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> No!<eos> I don't know if you're aware of this, but it's all just sand around here.
It knows all of our secrets, Isaac.<eos> You still don't believe?<eos> There's nothing to believe.<eos> You're going to pay for what you did.<eos> -All of you.

The son does not inherit the debts of the father.<eos> James Delaney has declared a new trading company in his own name.<eos> And my father's debts amounted to a sum total of £215 and 17 shillings.<eos> Behold, £215 and 17 shillings.<eos> Mr Thoyt will pay each one of you exactly what you are due, but you will form an orderly line.
The Gypsy woman owns this island between two parishes.<eos> It is tradition she offers duellists a little token of good luck.<eos> Three shillings each for heather and goose feathers.<eos> This is not a fairground.<eos> Gentlemen, a slight has been perceived and one of you seeks satisfaction.
So, you are now one of us.<eos> Your apprentice.<eos> Lick. Lick your finger.<eos> Now, gentlemen, before I go on the subject of confidence... and betrayal, I hear that the Company are offering £10 for any information.<eos> I also know that one of you has already considered collecting.
Held you under, until the bubbles stopped!<eos> She was deranged, James!<eos> That's why your father had her committed to Bedlam. To protect you.<eos> To save your life, son. Desperate for your death!<eos> It took three men to pull you apart.
Oh, my God, are you crying too?<eos> I'm just...<eos> I'm so happy to be here with all of you.<eos> Celebrating you, Aria.<eos> Well, I couldn't have imagined this day without you guys.
The car is here.<eos> Well, you're gonna send us a ton of photos, right?<eos> Oh, and don't forget to take pictures of all of your hotel rooms before you mess it up with all your stuff.<eos> There's this new group chat app that we should all be on.<eos> I'll text it to you.
Can I hold her?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hello, Kate.<eos> I was looking at pictures on Emma's Facebook.<eos> Not to sound creepy, but it was a way to make sure that you're both okay.
I'll leave it at that.<eos> Tick-tick-tick.<eos> Could she put a shirt on?<eos> Boom.<eos> Our very first project will be for each of you to do a family tree, where you get to talk about your wonderful family.
I hate this.<eos> Malia.<eos> I gotta leave for a few, okay?<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Whatever's happening, it's worse for you guys.
Too much?<eos> I got one.<eos> SCOTT:<eos> What's that? An induction script.<eos> One of you is going to talk me through this.
But I am.<eos> I'm not in the pack.<eos> But no one likes a Nazi.<eos> Your little friends are no match for the Wild Hunt.<eos> There are too many of us and too few of you.
Our people are disappearing.<eos> Whatever this turns out to be, you'll handle it.<eos> Good morning, ladies.<eos> I find myself suddenly in need. Of a private investigation and security firm.<eos> I have a business proposition for you.
I got involved with some investors, powerful people who are using this restaurant as a front for their other interests.<eos> The Bureau is giving you 24 hours to find out as much as you can from Kenji.<eos> Chef asked me to give you this.<eos> We may need to come up with a different strategy.<eos> I have a business proposition for you.
Cesspool of witches.<eos> And look at him.<eos> Wizard's right-hand man.<eos> Gonna get us all killed hunting for some girl who fell from the sky.<eos> So I'll tell you what... we break south, find the girl ourselves, ride back to Emerald City with her head, then we'll have the Wizard's loyalty.
I killed 'em.<eos> All of them.<eos> Do you know my mother? Dorothy?<eos> You've come home.<eos> I know much you've invested in us, and it's paying off.
Is what over?<eos> You looked into my mother's eyes and you said a great war lay ahead of us,<eos> one in which pirates and slaves would stand together and strike a blow that might shake the very foundation of the British Empire.<eos> Now our ships are gone, our army is fractured, battered, and beaten.<eos> And the only man among you I trusted is dead.
It's very sharp.<eos> Your King Edward VII was smitten by this beauty.<eos> I see.<eos> But Your Majesty, just for my curiosity, how much is this sword worth?<eos> Let's just say that if I send this to the Indian National Army, then Boss's army can get whatever they need to free India from you.
Where were you, buddy?<eos> Where were you, buddy?<eos> All the world's a stage and the stage is mine.<eos> Ours! Ours!<eos> I have a surprise for all of you.
Listen, stay away from her.<eos> If her man finds out, he'll bury you both alive.<eos> Zulfi, my pistol"<eos> - To hell with it!<eos> Especially for you!
Please.<eos> Dump the body in the jungle.<eos> He was an INA spy.<eos> Which of you knew that?<eos> Are there others like him.. Amongst you?
Shots fired, shots fired!<eos> Let's see how much your boyfriend loves you.<eos> - Oh, my God. He's got David.<eos> - Who's David?<eos> One of you is gonna die.
_ _<eos> If there's any explaining to be done, then you'll do it.<eos> You're playing a dangerous game, Superintendent.<eos> Not nearly as dangerous as the one you're playing.<eos> If I submit a full report about young Spode's murder this afternoon, the German C-in-C of Great Britain will likely find it very healthy to distance himself from you, as will your colleagues in Berlin.
No, it won't.<eos> I'm sorry, Carla.<eos> No.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I know this is sad for you both.
They're probably abducting black people, brainwashing 'em and making 'em slaves. Or sex slaves.<eos> Not just regular slaves, but sex slaves and shit.<eos> See, I don't know if it's the hypnosis that's making 'em slaves or whatnot, but all I know is they already got two brothers we know, and there could be a whole bunch of brothers they got already.<eos> What's the next move?<eos> And don't ever, ever say that I don't do nothin' for you.
In fact, it ruined just about everything... as you'll soon see.<eos> And stick around, Justin.<eos> I'm not through with you yet.<eos> I know you probably didn't mean to let me down.<eos> In fact, most of you listening probably had no idea what you were truly doing, but you'll find out.
You don't want to do this.<eos> - You think I'm scared of you?<eos> - You should be.<eos> Fuck you!<eos> How many of you remember the Oh My Dollar Valentines?
If you're lucky, you live a long life... and one day your body stops working and it's over.<eos> Please, Bryce.<eos> Just relax, just relax.<eos> But if you're not lucky, you die a little bit... Yeah, that's good. ...over and over... until you realize it's too late.<eos> I know some of you might think there was more I could have done, or should have done.
No. You didn't just hope.<eos> You got us here.<eos> I was beginning to lose faith.<eos> But then I saw you. And you nodded at me.<eos> I mean, just the fact that you knew I didn't leave, that you searched and found me, that you, seeing these numbers, you seemed so...
Warlords? It's four-player and quite the hoot.<eos> Whatever you want.<eos> Do you want a massage?<eos> Negan loves them. And I was a licensed therapist.<eos> Mm. While I appreciate the gesture and your commitment to your assigned objective, I am fully aware that none of you ladies are here this evening of your own volition.
It's over.<eos> Just talk to them, okay?<eos> It's not over!<eos> They've forgotten.<eos> You've all forgotten. Some of you actually want to fight them? After everything?
I mean, I get me, my people.<eos> But Eugene?<eos> He's one of yours.<eos> And after what he did... He stepped up.<eos> You people... are animals.
So, you don't like Eugene anymore.<eos> You guys gotta like Sasha.<eos> I do, too.<eos> Got her right here packaged for your convenience, alive and well.<eos> Now, I brought her so I wouldn't have to kill all of you, and not killing all of you could get complicated.
Just tell me what you want.<eos> I want you and your sister to come home.<eos> Oh, but... don't... Don't you have infinite versions of me and my sister?<eos> You don't have to kick me while I'm down, Morty.<eos> Look, there's no replacing either of you without an amount of work that would ultimately defeat the purpose.
Obviously, I came here last night during a blackout.<eos> "Obviously?"<eos> You came here and defeated our arch nemesis... while so drunk you don't remember doing it?<eos> That's something "obvious" to you?<eos> Look, I'm a lit... little more complex than you guys, and, no offense, but I've always suspected that a lot of what you do in a year could be knocked out in a couple of hours.
- Congrats!<eos> - You did it it!<eos> It was a bit.<eos> All of the descriptors apply to all of you.<eos> Drunk Rick's point is that none of you are very special or different.
Don't worry so much, you'll get wrinkles.<eos> Now pull!<eos> You told me to pull. Put these on.<eos> They were my husband's.<eos> So, what can I do for you?
And marry that woman. For the sake of your son.<eos> I didn't marry, on principle.<eos> But I recognised my son.<eos> Look at me!<eos> Not like that sod who turned his back on you.
Damn right it will, Travis.<eos> How many terraformers her family own, anyway?<eos> All of them.<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> I'll catch up with you in a minute.
Ask him about his travels.<eos> Tell me this, Dar.<eos> Off the record, just you and me.<eos> Does that sound like a solid intelligence-gathering effort to you, or does that sound like a way to provoke a crisis with Iran we inherit on inauguration day?<eos> No one is trying to saddle you with anything, Rob.
I did what you said.<eos> Hey. Next time, you ask for half up front.<eos> You f-- You fucking assholes.<eos> About fucking time.<eos> Assholes-- all of you.
Test your sword-craft!<eos> Do battle with a turd, directly from the devil's arse!<eos> You can cut him, but you cannot kill him!<eos> And if he kills you, then so be it!<eos> More fool you!
- Are they mine, the twins?<eos> - Irrelevant.<eos> It's relevant if you want me to answer your fucking question.<eos> They're not yours.<eos> She was working for you.
Everyone in Nassau knows what Long John Silver's return means, what's expected of them when he does return.<eos> All that remains is for him to return.<eos> We're not apart on this island.<eos> We cannot be apart.<eos> Many of you have got kin at the Underhill estate.
There's a fight soon to be underway in Nassau.<eos> A fight that... we are entitled to be a part of.<eos> A fight to answer a cowardly crime.<eos> A fight... that's been stolen from us by you fucking people.<eos> So... the way I see it, each one of you owes us a fight.
I will not undermine his position once the shooting starts.<eos> So, right now in this moment, what do you want to do?<eos> How?<eos> How would you see it done?<eos> One of you surrenders himself and remains here to ensure these terms are honored.
I've heard about his role amongst your maroon allies.<eos> Were you with him before he died? I was.<eos> I've been told that he departed the island before all of this started.<eos> That he killed two soldiers in the process.<eos> Everyone assumed he'd turned, that somehow one of you had turned him, but that isn't what happened, is it?
And they almost killed me and my wife.<eos> We'll find them.<eos> But we had them.<eos> I had them!<eos> I found them. For you.
Maybe you're right, Andre.<eos> Look, I'll tell you what.<eos> I'll make it worth your whiles.<eos> I'll double your cuts.<eos> Every one of you.
- How do you do?<eos> Fine, thank you.<eos> It's a nice day.<eos> It is a nice day.<eos> I have some very bad news for you children.
Do you think Justice Strauss' library has any cookbooks?<eos> Baudelaires. I wasn't expecting to see you.<eos> We meant to come sooner. We've been cleaning.<eos> Yes, Count Olaf told me you were very particular about that.<eos> I hope you appreciate how much he's doing for you.
Yes, Count Olaf told me you were very particular about that.<eos> I hope you appreciate how much he's doing for you.<eos> I wouldn't say "much."<eos> Well, perhaps not compared to what you're used to.<eos> What can I do for you?
Seems confident it's to be done, doesn't he?<eos> To rescue her without paying the governor his ransom.<eos> He is confident in his plan... as am I.<eos> Maybe.<eos> One of you is more confident than the other, I think.
Well, we will absolutely take care of your transportation needs.<eos> I will make sure that you have access to shuttles or volunteer drivers... whatever you need.<eos> Yeah, I don't think you get what I'm saying.<eos> I want a car.<eos> I put together some numbers for you guys to look at.
Well, I have Luca to thank for that.<eos> Okay, here it goes.<eos> Luca and I are together.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Oh, wow. I should have told you earlier, but my last relationship was such a mess, that I wanted to make sure that it was something before I said anything, and now it is, and I told you as soon as I realized,
Sure.<eos> What's up?<eos> I'm sorry about making a scene at the wedding.<eos> Oh, that's okay.<eos> It's been a stressful year for both of you.
Oh, it's huge!<eos> We could totally all fit!<eos> I mean, I know we haven't talked about it.<eos> I mean, I don't mean... It's just... this place is perfect.<eos> You could have the big room and if I gave up my apartment, it would totally be affordable.
It's more physical.<eos> I never understood the word "presence" until we were together.<eos> And if you're wondering about the sex... no matter what I say, it won't be enough.<eos> Yeah, it's pretty amazing.<eos> And what about now? What's it like when one of you is in pain?
Vince, look, I was just telling Richard... Save it.<eos> You know, straight out of the Academy, I was assigned to this neighborhood stabilization unit out in Brownsville.<eos> These are during the Fort Apache days.<eos> You remember that?<eos> Nah. None of you do.
Tell the Bureau what I know or ask out.<eos> Seems easy enough.<eos> I mean, you don't have to make it about her, right?<eos> It's been a few years. You want a change.<eos> [door bell rings, dog barking] Could be the high road for both of you.
Uh, anyone mind if I drink this one, too?<eos> You've had enough caffeine.<eos> All right.<eos> Go to my bag, get my hotspot.<eos> I'll upload for you.
- More drinks.<eos> - No, this is getting...<eos> He's lost his mind.<eos> So, where to... The past or the future?<eos> Well, the future, or course, away from all you cynics.
No.<eos> Uh-uh. We're not done here, Doctor.<eos> Agent Booth, Dr. Brennan, a word of advice.<eos> The person you're searching for has a pathological need for control.<eos> He, or she, will want to get as close to you as possible, to... manipulate you.
And I remember.... fighting off attackers with you by my side.<eos> In the Maluku Islands.<eos> I meant the motorcycle bar, but yes.<eos> The Maluku Islands, as well.<eos> I remember the day each of you was hired.
My proprietary algorithm allows me to recognize millions of objects, gestures, and voice commands.<eos> See, Booth?<eos> AMI is no different than us.<eos> That is not accurate, Dr. Brennan.<eos> Unlike you, my memory will never degrade with age.
But there is one thing I am not.<eos> You're not a murderer.<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> What about Barbara Baker?<eos> You think there's a chance she found out about you two?
Look, as I told your colleagues, we all want to help, but this is disrupting my students' learning environment.<eos> Don't you mean disrupting the tutors that you have taking the students' classes for them?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> And I told your people already, we didn't see Austin the day he died.<eos> So, I'm sorry, there's nothing more I can do for you.
Reiss didn't have a chance.<eos> Good luck telling him that.<eos> Look, there's got to be something more that we can bring Kovac in on.<eos> You and I both know that he's behind this.<eos> I bent the rules to get you those psych files.
The man who robbed you was murdered.<eos> Does that mean the money's been recovered?<eos> No, not yet.<eos> Working theory is that he had an accomplice that killed him for his cut.<eos> Now, listen, do either of you recognize this guy?
I just wanted to inform you we've moved your personal items from the changing area into your car.<eos> Oh, thank you very much.<eos> Hello.<eos> Hi. Yes, I, uh, I'd like to say a couple words.<eos> So, as most of you know, I'm Cam's daughter.
What is she doing here?<eos> She said something about a vision.<eos> I-I don't know, I've never seen her so worked up, though.<eos> So I'm supposed to miss this whole party and all this dancing because she had a bad dream?<eos> I know neither of you believe in this stuff, but you...
I don't think it was just any bullet.<eos> I hope not.<eos> Why didn't you say anything?<eos> Why didn't you say anything?<eos> Why didn't either of you say anything?
Well, she was presumed dead.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Nicole Gordon was never his fiancee.<eos> I am.<eos> I didn't realize there were two of you.
Severing ties with this town would be healthy for all of us.<eos> I didn't tell you this morning because I...<eos> I knew that you were already hurting, and I didn't want to...<eos> Sell it!<eos> Fine, do what's best for you guys.
I can't.<eos> My mom and I..<eos> Look, I know that this is just A.D.<eos> pressing on a raw nerve, right?<eos> They're just taking the fact that I'm some sort of Dickensian foundling but one of you needs to take this.
And what about destroying Ali's memorial?<eos> Stealing Caleb's money, joining Mona's army.<eos> I mean he has a dark side, Hanna.<eos> We all do when we're pushed hard enough.<eos> I don't care how many videos you show me he's my friend, just like every one of you.
Do you still see her when you look in the mirror?<eos> The, the loser the pigtails and the frumpy sweaters.<eos> 'Cause I see her.<eos> I see her right now.<eos> None of you are really certain who you are.
I was born on the same date as the Republic of Texas.<eos> And you do not reach my age without accommodating your fair share of change.<eos> - Yeah. I was taught at a very early age you have to roll with the punches.<eos> Hear, hear. Now... Now, I see some old faces here from a lot of different sides of a lot of different fights.<eos> Some of you, I've rode with. Yes, sir.
Hear, hear. Now... Now, I see some old faces here from a lot of different sides of a lot of different fights.<eos> Some of you, I've rode with. Yes, sir.<eos> Some of you, I've fought with.<eos> And some of you, I've bled with.<eos> That's right. And some of you, maybe back in the bad old days, might have taken a shot at me.
Are you gonna eat that?<eos> I'll have it, yeah.<eos> Good evening.<eos> I'm pleased to report that last month was our largest haul to date.<eos> So, for all you ass-busting quota makers, it's time for your weekly entertainment.
The groundbreaking for your new school.<eos> SymcoPetro wants to give back, not just with job-creating economic investments, but here, with the future.<eos> I was very clear when I accepted your offer, and I am grateful.<eos> Thank you. But there was to be no publicity.<eos> It is dangerous for you to be here.
Is this true? No.<eos> It's not true.<eos> I need you to be more positive. I don't work for you anymore, so what you need isn't my problem.<eos> I'm not going to let anything else happen to my girls.<eos> And if any of you have a speck of humanity in your hearts, neither will you.
I think you're gonna see an uptick, and you know what?<eos> If it turns out that Fudge wasn't actually in the war...<eos> Fudge is not a person.<eos> He wasn't in the war.<eos> Well, neither was Tom Cruise, and look what "Top Gun" did for you.
There are people in my government, believe it or not, who want that man out for their own convoluted foreign policy over here.<eos> That's the job Whip and I were sent here to do.<eos> But for some reason, we were betrayed.<eos> Which means we're getting out without Ramal.<eos> And every one of you is crucial to that plan.
My point is, it's awful, isn't it, that this is what happened to him.<eos> Like...<eos> Why are you crying?<eos> Did you even know Wes?<eos> Did any of you?
Did you even know Wes?<eos> Did any of you?<eos> I take it that's a no?<eos> Law school isn't really about making friends, right?<eos> Yeah, I bet some of you are really happy that he's dead 'cause that means your ranking goes up one.
You still are!<eos> Uh, no, I'm not.<eos> His body is missing, Connor!<eos> Do you even care about that?<eos> Do any of you?
Is that really an option?<eos> I failed.<eos> I promised to protect you all, and I didn't.<eos> I tried, but... the D.A. offered Wes immunity.<eos> It would make sense to come to you next.
Or maybe it was the both of you?<eos> Maybe we all just need to take a deep breath.<eos> Now Wes is gonna go down for Sam and Rebecca, and the two of you get off.<eos> Well, you know what? You need to grow the hell up!<eos> I'm doing this for you... Each of you...
- Ramal?<eos> There's a way out if we work together, but escape has to start from your cell.<eos> I'm no longer interested.<eos> The only thing left for you to do is to beg.<eos> Beg that I might let you live once my armies came, if only as a slave.
I'm a man moving toward the light now, and the light's beckoning me.<eos> I just don't know who's pulling the strings.<eos> But Sara says it's you.<eos> Oh, Sara put you onto me?<eos> Okay. I don't know who the bigger idiot is, you or her.
Dying for the truth?<eos> It's human nature to find stuff out, so you will.<eos> Or she will.<eos> And then the lie has to kill the truth.<eos> Which one of you is gonna die ne...?
But you can't let one little misunderstanding destroy years of friendship.<eos> Myrtle: Oh, it's just not the same, Jimmy.<eos> She showed her true colors.<eos> When it came to that settlement, we were the furthest things from her mind.<eos> It just took her a bit to realize what was important to you.
Hello! Hi there.<eos> Jimmy. Okeydokey.<eos> Testing. Testing.<eos> - Good morning. - All: Good morning.<eos> I know that many of you were expecting Sandy for this morning's chair yoga, but her daughter has a cold.
I wouldn't do it.<eos> Thenwithinweeks, Sarawasincarcerated,beaten.<eos> And so I gave in.<eos> Everything I did, i did for family, for you, for Sara, for Mike.<eos> So none of you would ever have to spend another day inside a prison cell or... Or live a life on the run.
I don't think that's quite it.<eos> Welcome to Graceland.<eos> Don't just stand there and let the AC out.<eos> Come on in.<eos> What can I do for you fine folks?
No, no, no, no!<eos> Come on, Mike, come on.<eos> Where are the tracks?<eos> Where are the tracks?<eos> This is for you. Look.
You wanna know why?<eos> Because tomorrow when we do the exchange, you get to find out how much your brother really loves you.<eos> - Fuck you, Eddie.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I could probably learn something from you and JP.
- None of this is your fault.<eos> Alec, he's stressed out.<eos> With his parabatai gone, he's like a different person.<eos> Alec's right.<eos> I'm not one of you.
Was that your baby?<eos> One of them, I think.<eos> She takes our memories.<eos> I just remember little bits at a time.<eos> Wait, there's... There's more of you?
Please come back with us.<eos> We need you.<eos> Clary needs you.<eos> You think that I don't wanna be there for Clary?<eos> For all of you?
No!<eos> Okay, maybe movie night wasn't such a good idea.<eos> Maybe you're right.<eos> After all, we did just lose Rip.<eos> I know Nate and I never really got to know Rip, but we know how much he means to the rest of you.
January 2025.<eos> Oh, you got somewhere to go?<eos> Funny, just like clockwork...<eos> Take the Time Sphere back to 2025 and secure the rest of the Spear.<eos> The next one of you who screws up will lose more than just a tooth.
If Lily's presence on the Waverider posed any temporal issues, I'm sure Gideon would have detected them.<eos> Plus, Grey said Lily could hook the Medallion up with Gideon, so...<eos> Wait, she wants to try networking an ancient amulet with an advanced AI system?<eos> I'm totally helping.<eos> Fine. Then I would appreciate it if you... If none of you would reveal to her that she's an Aberration.
No one knows who to trust.<eos> So they all end up screwing each other over.<eos> It's an interesting theory.<eos> Which one are we?<eos> The point is that neither of you are Clint Eastwood and so neither of you end up going home with the gold.
- We don't wanna fight you.<eos> We're your friends.<eos> Your family.<eos> - Caitlin, I love you.<eos> - I never loved any an you.
I'm sorry, Tina.<eos> Aw, so sweet.<eos> I thought you two were just cop buddies, but... You can tell me, Vin.<eos> You're tapping that sweet ass, aren't you?<eos> Heh heh heh. I wasn't sure which one of you to kill.
Feels like a lifetime ago.<eos> For Shado, it was.<eos> No time for nostalgia.<eos> I know where they're going.<eos> Do either of you know anything about this place that could give us a tactical advantage?
We made ramen.<eos> - I see that. - Want some?<eos> It's good.<eos> Salty.<eos> Slurpy. Naw, I'm not hungry, but I'm gonna grab a beer and come join you.
It's good.<eos> Salty.<eos> Slurpy. Naw, I'm not hungry, but I'm gonna grab a beer and come join you.<eos> So, Grace, what brings you by?<eos> Just checking on you two, making sure you're getting along.
Hi. Ooh, hey.<eos> Heard you're getting a new roommate.<eos> - Hope she doesn't keep you up all night.<eos> - Huh?<eos> Ana and Isabella are moving in with you guys, right?
I, uh, I was just hopin' that she could, um, write me a letter of recommendation.<eos> Uh, but it's... it's not a big deal. It's... it's okay.<eos> No, it's fine.<eos> Look, I'm sure she'd be happy to do it.<eos> Why don't you, um, just give me your name and number, and I'll have her get a hold of you.
James Edlund-- husband and father of two daughters, ages 9 and 11.<eos> Until 16 months ago.<eos> What happened 16 months ago?<eos> Crosspoint Mall shooting.<eos> We're coming to you live at the mass shooting at Crosspoint Mall today.
Excuse me, Mr. Mayor, but 7 of your staffers are dead and others severely injured.<eos> Don't you think you owe them a response beyond "it's complicated"?<eos> I do.<eos> I owe it to them.<eos> I don't owe it to any of you.
To Star City, Mayor Oliver Queen is a hero.<eos> This marks only the second time in the 140-year history of this city that a mayor has faced impeachment.<eos> In 1898, Mayor Prescott was removed from office.<eos> We'll see what fate awaits Oliver Queen, who's stepping into the building now.<eos> Hey, I'll catch you up there, all right?
It seems that you are deciding vote, Viktor.<eos> What say you, my friend?<eos> We have a new Pakhan.<eos> This is most disappointing.<eos> I liked many of you.
Previously on "Arrow"... This laptop contains 40 million rubles worth of bank transfers from Kovar that Gregor hasn't disclosed.<eos> This is most disappointing.<eos> I liked many of you.
And we'd be going in completely blind.<eos> We have a greater chance of success if we let Helix come to us.<eos> Wait, Lyla.<eos> You want to set a trap for Helix and use James as the bait?<eos> I don't think I need to tell either of you how dangerous Helix is.
I'm sort of half laughing.<eos> Something's going on.<eos> That something's coming at us.<eos> I know you know where Burkhardt is.<eos> I will find him, and if either one of you gets in my way,
Best to be completely honest, don't you think?<eos> There's nothing honest about that.<eos> Your highness, are we free to go?<eos> Oh yes.<eos> It seems one of you already has.
Oh, I bet you'd love to get your hands on your precious Soul Sword now.<eos> Well, you're in luck.<eos> I'm gonna be sending it with you.<eos> Considering my Demon Blood, it didn't seem wise to leave such a powerful weapon just lying around, even if it is deactivated...<eos> It seems a rather fitting end to you both, don't you think?
I'm right about this.<eos> It's done.<eos> Yeah... it's done.<eos> Sooner or later, it happens to us all.<eos> Me, you, everyone we love.
Then it be a fool's errand.<eos> We want no orders from that foul dwarf hell itself excreted.<eos> I was sent by Mary.<eos> Tonight she plans to vanquish the boy.<eos> She can not do it without you.
To complete the task.<eos> Without any distraction... from you.<eos> N-No.<eos> You're no threat to me or mine now.<eos> None of you are.
Black Sunday is still coming.<eos> Death and destruction to Salem.<eos> Do not imagine you have killed my brother.<eos> You have only destroyed his mortal self... merely sent him back to hell.<eos> Now, more than ever, it is imperative that none of you open the wrong doors.
The Sentinel has made it clear that he has armed his instrument.<eos> The Red Mercury is somewhere in Salem, all ready to do its work of destruction... with or without him.<eos> I know where it is.<eos> But I shall not be sharing that information just yet.<eos> I'm aware of how most of you feel about me, and I would have some insurance that I am not fated to go the same way as the boy and his Sentinel.
Stand together!<eos> Not you.<eos> I'm not wasting good wine on a damn woman.<eos> Maybe I'm not the most pleasant man. I'll admit it.<eos> But I'm proud of you lot.
But I'm proud of you lot.<eos> You're my family, the men who helped me slaughter the Starks at the Red Wedding.<eos> Yes, yes.<eos> Cheer.<eos> Brave men, all of you.
I never wanted it. I never asked for it.<eos> But I accepted it because the North is my home.<eos> It's part of me, and I will never stop fighting for it, no matter the odds.<eos> But the odds are against us.<eos> None of you have seen the Army of the Dead.
Yes.<eos> Is he still dead?<eos> I mean, he was.<eos> I, I haven't seen him.<eos> Don't know what either of you are up to now.
Valhalla anew.<eos> Doesn't that sound swell?<eos> An oyster.<eos> Inside every pearl there's a single irritating grain of sand.<eos> That's me. Otherwise, you wouldn't be here.
The Prophet is here!<eos> Listen to me!<eos> Jerome is here.<eos> He never left us.<eos> Each of you kept him alive.
Listen to me!<eos> Jerome is here.<eos> He never left us.<eos> Each of you kept him alive.<eos> Each of you is Jerome.
Where wilt thou lead me?<eos> Speak, for I will go no further.<eos> I say, Ghost, speak your business or I shall go no further!<eos> My business is not with you, Prince of Denmark. But with your audience.<eos> I've come to address you, the ruling class of Gotham.
I say, Ghost, speak your business or I shall go no further!<eos> My business is not with you, Prince of Denmark. But with your audience.<eos> I've come to address you, the ruling class of Gotham.<eos> You've kept a secret for far too long.<eos> But tonight I will kidnap and torture one of you to expose the truth.
- On we go.<eos> - My name is Francisco Ramon.<eos> I wasn't always the esteemed engineer you see before you.<eos> It was my love of science that allowed me to overcome my tough upbringing and join S.T.A.R. Labs, before our beautiful and handsome founder, Harrison Wells, stepped down.<eos> I hope my love of science will inspire some among you to join the scientific community.
Welcome to S.T.A.R. Labs.<eos> My name is Francisco Ramon.<eos> I wasn't always the esteemed engineer you see before you, but after years of hard work and studying,<eos> - I hope my love of science... - Should we go talk to him?<eos> Will inspire some among you to join the scientific community as we strive to reach a new age for humanity.
A home, you know, it's more than bricks and mortar and a turtle.<eos> It's a... it's a feeling.<eos> It's a feeling of belonging, isn't it?<eos> Of... of love, of course... hope for the future.<eos> I don't know if I have ever met two people who are more suited to one another than you two.
Ladies and gentlemen, for today's perp walk, we have a literal degenerate:<eos> The one and only Clive Yorkin.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Captain Mendez, Detective West, thanks for the assist.<eos> Couldn't have bagged this goon without you.
I take his place.<eos> I rule the gorillas, and I promise to keep them in Gorilla City.<eos> How do we know we can trust you?<eos> Because... even though you sent me away, your Earth is still my home.<eos> And there are those among you... I will never forget.
Sorry.<eos> I should've been stronger.<eos> You think you should've shot Kadabra?<eos> Dad, I think you showed true strength by letting him go.<eos> I try to be strong for you guys, for you and Wally and Barry.
You hadn't visited Iris in years.<eos> Yeah, that's what I've heard.<eos> Cisco told me, or showed me, that you all haven't been a team in a long time.<eos> And I know that I'm the reason for that.<eos> Iris's death shouldn't have driven me away from you all.
I broke that promise to her... to all of you.<eos> You made me realize, even though Savitar's gone, I've... I've still been letting him win.<eos> I was wrong to do that.<eos> If you're all willing to... try to be a family again... I think I can, too.<eos> I don't know which... which one of you to hug first.
I swear to you, I will find you a cure.<eos> Caitlin, I love you.<eos> I don't love you, Julian.<eos> I never did.<eos> I never loved any of you.
I swear to you, I will find you a cure.<eos> Caitlin, I love you.<eos> I don't love you, Julian.<eos> I never did.<eos> I never loved any of you.
Remember what you've done.<eos> Oh, I do.<eos> I remember all of it.<eos> And even though I can't feel a damn thing for Elena, the more you try and push her out, the more I understand she's never going away.<eos> And there's not enough room in my head for both of you.
Once you figure out what's holding him back, I should be able to repair the damage.<eos> We already tried going into his head, remember?<eos> Didn't go well.<eos> Yeah, that's 'cause you went through the front door.<eos> But lucky for you, I can get you in through the back.
Nobody else has to die.<eos> I beg to differ.<eos> Here's another thief.<eos> Stop!<eos> Those of you who feel yourselves to be good people, free of evildoing, you may be excused.
We will?<eos> You betcha.<eos> Do you, Stefan, take this lovely woman to be your lawfully wedded wife?<eos> I do.<eos> And do you, Caroline, take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband, to have and to hold, in sickness and in health, till death do you part?
Duh.<eos> Damn it, Katherine.<eos> Where is she?<eos> It really is the perfect revenge.<eos> At 10:00 p.m., Mystic Falls will burn, precious Elena will burn and I'm guessing one of you two Salvatores are going down with her.
Oh, I had sex.<eos> Meet Sharon.<eos> Oh, yeah. She can attest to my whereabouts all night long.<eos> And she can, too.<eos> Now... if you'll excuse me, I'd like to go somewhere where you two are not.
Sam!<eos> ...stays dead.<eos> No! Stop it!<eos> Dean.<eos> If any of you change your minds, you know my name.
Hi.<eos> These are my sons. Hi.<eos> Glad to meet you. She said a lot of good things.<eos> Yeah. Right back at you, man.<eos> Your, your mom's real proud of you boys.
You're headed past the Armory. If you wouldn't mind.<eos> Unpack, reshelve, and my Sig Sauer could use a good scrubbing.<eos> I have three PhDs.<eos> And we're all very proud of you, luv.<eos> I'm doing this for you.
And, of course, you know Mary Winchester and her son.<eos> Sam, please. Plenty of seats.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> All right, then. Let's begin.<eos> As most of you know, Phase One of Project V is nearly complete.
Michael, you have both conquered many trials here at kendricks, either through natural talent or good old-fashioned hard work.<eos> But today, today we'll learn which of you matriculates to the next level of training.<eos> This organization does important work, gentlemen... Work which allows millions of people to sleep safely in their beds at night.<eos> But in order to do this work, to protect those people, we need cadets who will employ their skills and execute orders without question.<eos> And so... only one of you will be leaving this room.
If we run, we might not get caught.<eos> We can go to my father.<eos> He'll close the door, Timothy.<eos> We need cadets who will execute orders without question.<eos> Mick, we have to go. Only one of you will be leaving this room.
He gave me her phone number.<eos> Yeah, nice.<eos> My loyal... Ish subjects, these troubled times,<eos> I'm aware there might be some confusion as to where you're supposed to place your loyalty.<eos> Even with Lucifer back in the cage, there are those of you who would try to help him...
Right.<eos> This is Eileen leahy.<eos> The banshee girl.<eos> We have a file.<eos> From what Mick tells me, neither of you have any formal training.
Again and again.<eos> When you were taken, I searched for months and I couldn't find you.<eos> And then Kelly escaped on my watch, and I couldn't find her.<eos> And I just wanted...<eos> I needed to come back here with a win for you.
That Brit douche Renny, she thought that the British men of letters were on her.<eos> "I know they're following me, watching me.<eos> "They tapped my phone.<eos> I found a microphone in my room."<eos> "I hate to be all girly, but I could bunk with you guys for a days until I sort this out?"
Mature.<eos> Real mature!<eos> You guys?<eos> I really want to enjoy this.<eos> Really wanna savor just ripping you apart, gettin' all up in there, and gettin' all gooey.
You what?<eos> Ian...<eos> I blacked out.<eos> Oh, for God's sake...<eos> Well, I'd had a row with Sarah, cos she hates all of you, and you hate her, and she'd gone.
Well, I'd had a row with Sarah, cos she hates all of you, and you hate her, and she'd gone.<eos> I had a row with Trish, and then I started drinking tequila.<eos> You can vouch for me. If it comes up, you can, you can tell 'em what I'm like if I drink tequila.<eos> How much do you remember?<eos> Mate, you had a lot of booze on that night. And it'd been a tough week.
- Oh, aye, you do.<eos> You boys, you wee babies, that think they're men you hurt my girl.<eos> So from now on I am gonna be watching everything you do.<eos> I'm gonna be watching everything your parents do, everything your family does.<eos> If any one of you even so much as belch when you shouldn't, I will be there.
I'm hurting.<eos> You're hurting. The whole bloody world's hurting.<eos> But he has to make it about him.<eos> He takes all the oxygen, all the attention.<eos> "Look at me, I'm Mark Latimer. And I am so much sadder than the rest of you."
And what about the twine? Did you touch that?<eos> Yeah. I pulled it out to see. - Why?<eos> - I didn't know what it was.<eos> It wasn't till I saw the twine that I called you.<eos> And then I called you.
Did you not want to live?<eos> No.<eos> What about us?<eos> Me and... Chlo and Lizzie.<eos> I don't feel part of you any more.
Lord Ceolwulf?<eos> Yes, of course I have read your letters.<eos> You're looking for a buck!<eos> A match, Lord.<eos> And I have a name for you right here... in a letter of my own.
Look at Klaus' face!<eos> Oh, no, no, no, orphans.<eos> Look at mine.<eos> Shall I let them off the hook?<eos> I spent all morning making these cupcakes for you.
Imagine a table in front of you.<eos> Now take the last 48 hours of your life and lay it on that table.<eos> Spread it out, and take a good look at your work.<eos> It's extraordinary, isn't it?<eos> Each you came here feeling lost and trapped by a narrative written by others.
And this is just the beginning.<eos> From now on, when you look at your life and the people in it, things will look different.<eos> Non-productives will fade to the background, while possibility comes into focus.<eos> But be prepared as you begin to build your new life, people from your old life may disagree with your design.<eos> Just keep building and know that IHM is always here for you.
And then it turned into wrestling.<eos> Only because you said I didn't tag you, and I... I, clearly, I did.<eos> Yeah, but who's... who's the one who got the worst of it?<eos> Not me.<eos> I just can't wait until at least one of you acts like you're not 12 years old.
Adding more product will threaten the reliability of the entire operation.<eos> May I ask... did Don Eladio approve this?<eos> Excuse me, everyone.<eos> Could you all please take a moment and join me out here?<eos> I would, uh, I would like to apologize to each and every one of you who, yesterday, had to endure the behavior of those men.
Excuse me, everyone.<eos> Could you all please take a moment and join me out here?<eos> I would, uh, I would like to apologize to each and every one of you who, yesterday, had to endure the behavior of those men.<eos> It was unacceptable. Despite the difficult circumstances, you all acquitted yourselves impeccably.<eos> That said, if any of you wish to seek counseling due to lingering trauma, speak with me privately, and it will be arranged.
It was unacceptable. Despite the difficult circumstances, you all acquitted yourselves impeccably.<eos> That said, if any of you wish to seek counseling due to lingering trauma, speak with me privately, and it will be arranged.<eos> Also, you will all be receiving 24 hours of overtime, as I am sure, in one way or another, each of you brought this incident home with you.<eos> Uh, yes, Lyle?<eos> Mr. Fring, uh... who were those guys? Well, some of you know, that many years ago,
That's not what we agreed to.<eos> How about that for starters?<eos> He did give us the first one for free. Yeah, I know.<eos> Okay, how about this... how about we pay you $450 for the one that already aired, and then we take it from there?<eos> Guys, I don't wanna get technical on ya, but that commercial... it doesn't actually belong to you.
Mm-hmm.<eos> I believe I'll have the veal tonight, Michael, please.<eos> And Mamacita, I noticed you were eyeing the liver.<eos> Yeah, with onions.<eos> Mm-hmm. And fish sticks for you girls?
We're both leads.<eos> Ladies, why are we fighting about the Oscars?<eos> We haven't even finished making this movie yet.<eos> Can we please concentrate on the matter at hand?<eos> There's room for both of you to succeed.
I'm an engineer.<eos> And, folks, we have got an engineering problem here.<eos> Let's do the math.<eos> 13,289 cops in Chicago;<eos> 2,869,121 people... which means each of you protects and serves 215.9 people.
Well, look who's here.<eos> - If it isn't Jack Warn...<eos> - What is this shit about you not wanting to promote the picture?<eos> Jesus Christ, Joan.<eos> I already have a cross-country tour announced for the two of you.
Can't afford to have Howard upend everything we've been working on.<eos> Looking for a refill?<eos> Nah, I'm trying to kick it.<eos> I'm here to sell you on something.<eos> We got a business proposal for you.
- How are the twins?<eos> - Doing great.<eos> Bob.<eos> It's good to be back to see you.<eos> - Do any of you really think...
- I'm coming.<eos> Find him.<eos> Are you the meeting?<eos> I'll take you to the meeting.<eos> Only one of you.
Did you know about this?<eos> You mean, did I lie to you?<eos> We nearly lost John for a sex tape?<eos> This work we do takes a special kind of person, a unique sense of teamwork, and complete trust in each other.<eos> I would never, ever send any of you into a situation without giving you all the information you need.
Because of what happened to Jason.<eos> They're gonna tell us at the assembly.<eos> Who's Jason and what happened to him?<eos> Thank you for that moment of silence.<eos> Many of you were lucky enough to have known my brother personally.
Goodmorning, students. This is your principal speaking.<eos> There have been many inquiries about the upcoming pep rally.<eos> So let me state clearly, it is happening, as scheduled.<eos> Now, on a less felicitous note, if you could give your attention to sheriff keller.<eos> Most of you already know the details,
I just spent the last 24 hours in the gothic horror story that is Cheryl Blossom's life.<eos> And it just reminded me how lucky I am.<eos> To have a mom who protects me.<eos> Then I need to tell you about something that happened last night at Pop's.<eos> I saw a lot of fire and hustle from both of you this week.
Please, Mom, she really needs our help.<eos> Fred. You try to hire my crew on the first day of construction?<eos> Opportunity knocks when it knocks.<eos> Nothing personal.<eos> Yeah, it never is with you guys.
This pointless, stupid fighting.<eos> - Honey...<eos> - No, don't touch me.<eos> We were supposed to be together.<eos> And you didn't let us have that, neither of you.
I'm with Betty.<eos> We're looking for Jughead.<eos> Wait.<eos> You and Betty went on a manhunt without me?<eos> I'll come meet you.
Hey, Jughead's a tough kid.<eos> Scrappy. A survivor.<eos> He'll make it.<eos> Especially if you're looking after him.<eos> And he'll try to pull away from you, he'll try to disappear into himself.
Take your emotions out of it.<eos> If I was being led by my emotions, you'd be a pile of red dirt right now.<eos> It's Mary and Julie for the thumb drive - and the diamonds.<eos> - Let me guess. You'll give us your word that everything will go smoothly?<eos> I know my word doesn't mean shit to you...
Christ Chapel of Bucktown.<eos> And your son... he's matriculated at Liberty University.<eos> That's Evangelical, if I'm not mistaken.<eos> You have a son in the Marines and a daughter in the Army.<eos> I selected each one of you for a very specific reason.
Okay, guys.<eos> Mr. Garcia here is the operations manager, but he also happens to be my cousin.<eos> So, be cool.<eos> Here at the U.S. Mint, we are big fans of thorough design.<eos> In fact, I'm willing to bet that most of you have a few of our best designs in your own pockets.
Let me see the quarter.<eos> So, here's what's going to happen.<eos> You're going to give everything you have to me,<eos> I'll handle turning it all over to the authorities.<eos> I'd advise the four of you to get lawyers, as the police will undoubtedly start asking questions quite soon.
I propose we fence off mountain trails we know the Farrells use.<eos> We're also going to post armed guards at places the Farrells have raided.<eos> I am Moregon, and we're the Kenna.<eos> We come from the shadow side of this mountain.<eos> So, you have no men among you.
Not much can grow there, I've heard.<eos> It's a harsh way to live.<eos> It's also the right way.<eos> And as you see, we endured.<eos> So, you have no men among you?
Damn, man.<eos> Shit.<eos> I'll take you up to county now while you wait on your trial.<eos> Arms above your head.<eos> What do we look like to you, when y'all came up our mountain?
But the reality is that we-- we can't have him in our lives anymore.<eos> That's the price we pay for having what we have.<eos> It's just the two of us.<eos> - I understand, mother.<eos> you just need to, like, cook a nice little dinner for the two of you.
In the name of God, do you Jenifer Rodriguez...<eos> Name?<eos> Tara.<eos> Adi!<eos> ...until death do you apart?
Tara.<eos> Adi!<eos> ...until death do you apart?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> ...as your lawfully wedded wife, until death do you apart?
Like the clobber?<eos> Everyone's wearing them.<eos> So, thank you and good evening.<eos> Welcome to Almanac, half an hour of music, chat and current affairs.<eos> And what a show we have for you tonight.
I'm not letting her go through this alone.<eos> Sister Ursula has been perfectly clear -- there will be consequences.<eos> Consequences be damned.<eos> Mrs Reed is my patient.<eos> If I've learned one thing from Nonnatus, from you, it's that we do what's right for our patient.
I'll catch you up.<eos> These are patients currently registered and their due dates, here.<eos> You can see we're busy.<eos> If I didn't think the Maternity Home was needed, I would close it down tomorrow.<eos> So why do you think they chose to come to you?
Be even better with some tomato ketchup.<eos> I'm afraid it's been packed.<eos> We don't move for ten days!<eos> Yes, and there's so much to do!<eos> I've looked out a box for each of you. Go through your possessions and root out anything that you no longer use.
Big bad Stan Cole.<eos> Come on... briefing's about to start.<eos> All right.<eos> I'm gonna rip the bandaid off quick.<eos> Most of you are TDY'd here for 60 days...
The Russian river killer, Hartford abduction. Under any other agent, that would have ended in a murdersuicide, and, agent Cole,<eos> Ohio Seven Sting, busting the Bad Axe Militia.<eos> I can't believe I'm standing here.<eos> I am...<eos> I'm eager to learn form you both.
Your Grace, please dismiss your guests.<eos> I have grave news.<eos> You must forgive my manners.<eos> You'll both be tired after your long journey.<eos> We'll have baths drawn for you and supper sent to your rooms.
- A priestess.<eos> I'll admit it, it is a subtle distinction.<eos> We're fighting a great war.<eos> - Wars cost money.<eos> - I wanted to be one of you.
So here's the deal.<eos> Gonna make it real simple for you.<eos> I've already taken down four of your guys with my bare hands.<eos> Now, I got some firepower.<eos> And unlike you idiots, I actually know how to use it.
How long were you all gonna pretend?<eos> Great.<eos> Um... so great job making me feel comfortable.<eos> I feel right at home. - Holden.<eos> Holden, come on. - No, I hope this doctor-prescribed reunion wasn't too hard for you all.
This is a party, so could we not talk about comas?<eos> Why are you drinking beer?<eos> It's a neutral color?<eos> Come on, I'm taking you where we got the good stuff.<eos> I'll catch up with you.
See you later. Or... or not.<eos> Hey, good luck on shawn parr's show.<eos> Love the song.<eos> Must feel nice to have a love song out there.<eos> That's all about you?
I'm very proud of you, but I just...<eos> We have concert rehearsal, so I will see you guys later.<eos> Is that okay?<eos> Well, she's certainly not in any danger.<eos> Look, I know this is very upsetting to both of you, but as long as she's okay with it, we're probably better off not making her think it's a bigger thing than it is.
This record is too important to us, and we can't write it if we've got some guy breathing down our necks all the time.<eos> - It's impossible.<eos> - Look, Rayna, I hear you, but this is the world we live in.<eos> We can't just put out an album and expect it to sell itself, okay?<eos> We have to keep finding new ways of promoting you.
- Thank you, Deacon.<eos> - Yeah. Really, I don't know what to say, just...<eos> Yeah, thanks.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, Welcome to our celebration of country's very best.<eos> We have a great show in store for you tonight.
- What if there's an emergency?<eos> Sweetie, I got along half my life without one of these things, all right?<eos> Daphne, I'm sorry.<eos> That's what's got to be.<eos> Trying to do my best here by both of you.
You are not Mom!<eos> - Mom was nice! - Hey, Daphne!<eos> Stop it!<eos> Both of you!<eos> Is that how your mother raised you guys?
I've spent my whole life trying to be nice.<eos> But when I am pushed too far, that ends.<eos> Now listen to me.<eos> I don't lose ever.<eos> So now you are gonna watch as I hold this label down by the throat until every single one of you comes to me begging for air.
You and I both know that breath can end.<eos> So we know that life is a gift.<eos> You'll miss Dawn, but you'll keep her with you.<eos> You'll keep that memory alive.<eos> And you'll live now for both of you.
The ag drone.<eos> Before the blues were charging at us, hillman spotted a stray ag drone over our position.<eos> You need to check that drone's feed.<eos> We'll certainly look into that.<eos> So seven un marines were charging you...
Art's request.<eos> Just keep yourselves and particularly Helena the blonde under wraps for now.<eos> He's right. Think of our babies.<eos> Great!<eos> I'll talk to you guys soon, okay?
Her current problem is she's a misogynist.<eos> My partner was overly versed in sensitivity training.<eos> Regardless, there's a divorce in the family, so we're shuffling the deck.<eos> You finally got a new partner, Art.<eos> My advice to you both:
Wow, it's time! It's time!<eos> What is going on?<eos> P.T. has something to tell us. What?<eos> Thank you.<eos> I am humbled to have pierced the veil and to address you on behalf of Mr. Westmorland.
And you'd stick a Jerry with a bayonet and apologise whilst doing it.<eos> And he also told me this: That there is nobody in this world that he would rather fight alongside.<eos> And do you know what?<eos> He was damn right!<eos> Now, tonight is for you.
It's only a few drinks. A few meals.<eos> A sob story at the end and Betsey handing over her wages to help her poor old mum.<eos> I didn't come here for a handout.<eos> Just thought you'd help yourself.<eos> It's all right for you. Places like this.
Now, I want you all to know these aren't just words.<eos> I'm here to start a revolution.<eos> And you know where that starts?<eos> Not with the new guns or the drones, amazing though they may be.<eos> It starts with all of you.
We're gonna pay for this sooner or later.<eos> You wanna get beat down again?<eos> It was totally worth it.<eos> "In my bag here, I have a fool-proof method for controlling your black slaves."<eos> I guarantee every one of you that if it is installed correctly it will control the slaves for at least 300 years.
Unfortunately, this is her on her best behavior.<eos> So what did you want?<eos> My daughter has a way to save us.<eos> It's a device that my brother invented to keep humans safe while radiating the atmosphere with Kryptonite.<eos> It would've made the planet uninhabitable for both of you.
Okay, okay, okay, I'm only the referee here, not taking sides, but you overstepped.<eos> Apologies.<eos> And let that be the first apology, not the last, to this audience, who have paid three grand for the privilege of hearing your barbaric yawp.<eos> - Axe, Axe, Axe. - Here's a thought.<eos> If any of you want to continue the conversation, I'll be over by the bar with my team.
They are the future of my name.<eos> And yours.<eos> You think you and Chuck are the only ones who've grappled with some upheavals in a marriage?<eos> Unless it is broken plates and steak knives, you gut through it.<eos> If one of you has an itch, you'll work it out.
- I did extra credit, got it up.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Nobody wants to gamble on this, get yoked to a loser.<eos> But you need to understand it is not a gamble, it is a calculated risk.<eos> So go naked into the street and snare me a thundering, monumental fucking case... because none of you are gonna get what you want until you cut yourselves open.
It is well known.<eos> King Richard killed both princes in the Tower.<eos> There is nobody for England now but you.<eos> Step forward.<eos> Which one of you is John de la Pole, the Earl of Lincoln?
- Everybody!<eos> What the hell is that about?<eos> Uh, it's semi-not related to any of this, but I think I know a temp fix.<eos> All right.<eos> I'll get back to you.
Step one... is for all of you to get very, very drunk.<eos> - Why?<eos> - You'll see.<eos> Chug-a-lug.<eos> As you grow, your name will become an important part of you.
Oh, no. Professor Li?<eos> This is a Cacodemon.<eos> - Jesus.<eos> - They'll grow much bigger. Unleash these and believe me, they'll keep The Beast plenty busy.<eos> Each of you will be given a special word to command your Cacodemon to attack.
Critical.<eos> He has high fever, tachycardia, hemoptysis.<eos> Why? What's wrong with him?<eos> How the hell should I know?<eos> Look, it doesn't seem like any of you are presenting symptoms, which excludes any pathogen, but without lab tests, there's no way to tell whether this is food poisoning or esophageal cancer or one of a thousand possibilities in between.
We say, "welcome home."<eos> Thank you so much for joining us at the greatest day Wilshire boulevard congregation.<eos> We hope you will make our home your home.<eos> You will not believe.<eos> They are very dangerous to you and to your family.
Detective Burke, you will oversee the surveillance operation as we look for Mr. Hallstead.<eos> Detective Bowman, you will return to the safe house and find whatever it is you missed the first time around.<eos> - Why am I the one being sidelined?<eos> - There is no sideline.<eos> I'm just waiting for one of you to do something useful.
What we're doing is for the good of the Belt, and everyone else.<eos> Whether you believe it or not.<eos> Boy, this ship is a Grade-A piece of shit, but she'll get us to Ganymede.<eos> Wouldn't bet on her in a race, though.<eos> Have any of you been to Ganymede recently?
My name is Praxideke Meng. You don't know me, but I was a colleague... I was a friend of your cousin, Doris.<eos> We worked together on Ganymede.<eos> She saved my life.<eos> She got me out of the station when the mirrors fell.<eos> She was on her way back to Mars, to be with you, but... She was badly injured in transit, and she died.
Am I going to have to break every bone in his body?<eos> It's not like that.<eos> You need to keep your eye on men.<eos> Men aren't where I keep my eye, actually.<eos> Imagine if time all happened at once... every moment of your life laid out around you... like a city.
Watch your tongue, black.<eos> You don't wanna upset me.<eos> You're awful!<eos> All of you, cowardy cheats.<eos> Not one of you has a thing up to your bearing on Valentine.
What are you doing, Martin?<eos> Fire!<eos> Cease fire!<eos> Pierre, go check on the target.<eos> The rest of you be ready to provide cover and fire on my command.
What happened to nick's stuff?<eos> I.A. Confiscated everything this morning.<eos> What the hell do they think they're gonna find?<eos> They are wiping the slate clean.<eos> I want you both out by the end of the day.
We just got a call.<eos> A man matching the suspect's description was seen entering the Englewood Hotel.<eos> I know it.<eos> Four blocks over.<eos> Oh, hey, I was just about to call you guys.
All we got now is an accident.<eos> We need to catch this Alpe in the act.<eos> So, we think the Alpe is using the Englewood Hotel as its own personal cafeteria.<eos> We need someone to spend one night in there, so that we can catch it the next time it strikes.<eos> Right, and it can't be either of you guys, since you've both been there as cops, which is why you're looking at me.
We have to stop him.<eos> We're doing everything we can.<eos> Trubel's with me.<eos> Thank God.<eos> - I'm gonna send her out to you.
Living's a risk.<eos> So tonight? I'll take my chance.<eos> Is it time?<eos> Bone? Ellery? Go back and guard the boat.<eos> The rest of you, certain?
- Because I'm not.<eos> In that case, maybe you're ready to talk about a merger.<eos> Robert, what are you doing here?<eos> Jessica didn't tell you?<eos> Before she left, I offered her a lifeline, and now I'm gonna offer the same thing to you.
Class of '09...<eos> Don't tell me.<eos> Zero.<eos> Look it up.<eos> None of you are ever going to make partner because there is no room at the top.
Now, I'm about to show you some very sensitive information.<eos> The final point totals each of you achieved for all your actions on Earth.
Me too.<eos> I'll race you.<eos> Best friends!<eos> Thank you all for participating in our focus group for Fake Eleanor.<eos> Think of this as an open forum for you to air any and all grievances that you may carry against her.
Did I use that word right?<eos> Eleanor Shellstrop.<eos> Hi, everyone, I'm Eleanor.<eos> Original flavor, not new and improved.<eos> I know a lot of bad stuff has happened because of me, but I never meant to hurt you, so if I caused you any harm, I'm truly sorry.
The original perpetrators are here.<eos> This is exhausting.<eos> I just want to go back to my container of goo and go to sleep.<eos> The Bad Place is owed two people.<eos> In my opinion, which is an objective fact in this case and all cases always and forever, you have all done bad things since you arrived here, therefore I don't care which two of you go.
You thought we would torture each other, and we did for a little, but we also took care of each other.<eos> We improved each other, and the four of us became a team.<eos> So, the only thing you succeeded in doing was bringing us all together.<eos> Oh, Eleanor. That's it!<eos> My big mistake was bringing you all together, having you be soul mates living next to each other.
Hurrah!<eos> Hurrah!<eos> Your gracious Majesty, thank you!<eos> You'll be as good as new in no time.<eos> Has either of you seen Lord Darnley?
- Counsel.<eos> - Ruining his life!<eos> - Tom broke up your joke of a marriage!<eos> - That's it!<eos> One more word out of either of you, and you'll find yourselves in solitary confinement for the first years of your sentence.
- Can I have some?<eos> You said it was a coffee commercial, Sandy!<eos> What the hell is going on here?<eos> Please, God, I need a miracle.<eos> "Remember, kids, if you laugh when you are blue, the sun will always shine on you.
It doesn't have my emotional intelligence yet but I thought I'd have a little fun with it in the meantime.<eos> Do you have your emotional intelligence yet?<eos> When it can top that, you might have something.<eos> Loser.<eos> Okay, which one of you said that?
And for the record, no one awesome listens to Enya.<eos> Well maybe not her later work.<eos> You're the whole team?<eos> Seems fair.<eos> There's only one of you.
- Yeah, but I'm not the one who had the least experienced lawyer I've ever met put this thing over the goal line.<eos> Come on, I thought I was the least experienced lawyer you've ever met.<eos> No, you were the least experienced dickhead I ever met.<eos> - Right.<eos> - Because that kid may be green, but he's the only one of you two that actually went to law school.
So you were lying to Nathan, only not about what he thought.<eos> - Listen to me--<eos> - I'm not gonna listen and you need to tell him what's going on.<eos> I can't do that and I wasn't lying to him when I said I'm not going back to my old firm.<eos> I wasn't lying to him when I said these people's lives matter to me and I wasn't lying to either one of you when I said
I hear that, but with the cops around Ghost, now how long before they start looking for his kid?<eos> All the questions they gonna be asking, too many ways this shit could play out.<eos> Me? I don't give a fuck.<eos> But you can't afford to get caught.<eos> - Neither of you.
Tell me... what exactly are you looking for?<eos> We're looking for mark harelik.<eos> We have a few questions for him.<eos> Right, right. Okay, so, I'm hearing tall...<eos> Right, maybe kinda soulful. You guys definitely came to the right place.
Well this I can't eat.<eos> Or this or this.<eos> Oh my gosh I am so sorry. Is... Is that a Jewish thing?<eos> It's a human being thing. It's disgusting.<eos> Look, I get it, things went sideways on your last job and it threw you.
I fought for my life, then ran.<eos> I never saw him again.<eos> If it was self defense...<eos> Why didn't you call the cops, report it?<eos> Because every time I've ever gone to you guys, you never do anything.
Even if you get the minimum sentence, your parole officer has not been born yet.<eos> You think you're noble?<eos> You all put in the effort now?<eos> You and your little boy scout cop.<eos> You know, six months ago, those girls were street trash to you.
I know him to be innocent.<eos> He wants only to serve His Majesty.<eos> He is wrongly accused and wrongly imprisoned.<eos> Your son has brought shame on the court, on you and on your family.<eos> You have no place here.
What?<eos> Again, I... again...<eos> I don't really know why he would mention that.<eos> It's super gross.<eos> Is this why Gavin Belson stopped working with you?
- Wheels up in 10.<eos> - Wait, wait, wait. What?<eos> Where are we going?<eos> To rescue him.<eos> I wasn't expecting you.
You are glass.<eos> Okay, Pushkin.<eos> I'll go get a hammer.<eos> I miss the cold war. A man could do his job without one hand tied behind his back.<eos> What, you've never been tempted to use every tool in the box?
Without it,<eos> Mace is about as strong as a paper bag in a rainstorm.<eos> Explains why you were so eager to find Burrows.<eos> God, I shouldn't have dragged him into this.<eos> And you two...
Not inspiring confidence.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hi!<eos> Oh, boy.<eos> Please tell me one of you speaks English.
Jeffrey, where's May?<eos> Where are they keeping her?<eos> Come on.<eos> We got to get him out of here.<eos> I've been looking forward to facing one of you, readying myself.
No. It can't be.<eos> Hello, again, traitor.<eos> Surprise.<eos> You shouldn't be here.<eos> None of you.
This book opened my eyes to the truth about Inhumans.<eos> It contains a plan to defeat them, and you can all be a part of it.<eos> I smell a load of L. Ron Horsecrap.<eos> Daisy, goodness. Is Coulson with you?<eos> We'll flush them to you.
All a young man needs is purpose and direction.<eos> We're a humble people, but everything we have comes through honest work.<eos> Isn't that right, Charles?<eos> That's right.<eos> I'm glad to see that my son hasn't been a burden to you.
And you must be Lord Bothwell.<eos> Too ill to stand?<eos> I was in the middle of a good hand, Your Majesty.<eos> Then by all means don't let me interrupt.<eos> Surely one of you gentlemen can beat a three flush?
Leeza!<eos> I won't be lied to again, mother.<eos> This is a cover-up, and you're behind it.<eos> I know how you work.<eos> Charles is not fit to be king, and if none of you will admit it, I'll bring the Vatican in as judge.
Didn't think much of it but then I looked half an hour later, he was still standing here.<eos> Where exactly?<eos> Right there. Right about there.<eos> That's when I realized he was staring into Dorothy's window.<eos> I didn't want to worry her with it but I thought with everything I should call you.
Now, girls, up.<eos> Wings.<eos> You may come forward and form a circle.<eos> You all know the rules for a particicution.<eos> When I blow the whistle, what you do is up to you.
Good morning, boys and girls.<eos> Who's ready to tear Watson Industries a new asshole?<eos> That's what I like to see.<eos> Now, on your desks,<eos> I've made each of you a copy of my initial brief.
Who's ready to tear Watson Industries a new asshole?<eos> That's what I like to see.<eos> Now, on your desks,<eos> I've made each of you a copy of my initial brief.<eos> Cling to it as if you wrote it yourself, and if any of you need to go to the bathroom,
Oh, bollocks. Not again.<eos> Today... you will compete in a series of trials designed to test your abilities.<eos> You have all been selected because you are, simply put, the best.<eos> The strongest. The smartest. The most able.<eos> And yet, only one of you will prove worthy enough to join our ranks.
We robbed you assholes blind.<eos> That wasn't my boyfriend.<eos> And he wasn't dead. We came in here, played y'all for the idiots y'all are... took your money, and drank your beer.<eos> So put your Goddamn hats back on.<eos> And tell me which one of you banjo-diddling little bitches has got the balls to earn your money back.
Yours?<eos> Good.<eos> - Did anything interesting happen?<eos> - Not really.<eos> You?
- Who told you that?<eos> - No one told me that. Just like no one told me that you can't fire him because that'll make you look weak.<eos> Which is why you took this meeting. Because you didn't want him taking it without you.<eos> - Okay, how in the hell are you doing all this?<eos> - I'm doing this because I'm Donna. And if it hasn't dawned on you already, so is this device.
Of course we can't... prove that.<eos> It's not possible to prove a negative.<eos> Words spoken by every hack who's ever copied someone else's technology and claimed it as their own.<eos> What's going on here?<eos> I came to you to negotiate an exclusion in good faith.
Now why the hell are you on my roof?<eos> This yours?<eos> He's a weather wrangler.<eos> Collects data out here to sell to companies inside the wall.<eos> 'Cause none of you powderpuffs can handle it out here.
No worries.<eos> This is pretty fucked up.<eos> Come on.<eos> May the Lord guide your steps and bring you to your June and your Hannah.<eos> He has not forgotten any of you.
All right, maybe I was a little bit scared.<eos> But the point is is I always like to keep it real.<eos> That's why I'm so proud to be a part of building the new Central L.A. Youth Center.<eos> This place is very important to me.<eos> 'Cause not only am I a movie star, but I'm also one of you guys.
This place is very important to me.<eos> 'Cause not only am I a movie star, but I'm also one of you guys.<eos> I grew up an orphan.<eos> And I never liked that word.<eos> Each and every one of you have a story as to how you got here.
What's going on with you?<eos> It's gonna have to wait.<eos> I'm crazy late already.<eos> I'll call you later.<eos> So how many of you jumped out of bed at 7:00 this morning, energized and ready to go without an alarm?
Over.<eos> I've not been around a murder case before.<eos> It's all hands on deck.<eos> Half the station's down at the Kingsmead estate.<eos> One of you, two teas and biscuits to DI Bradfield's office.
We'll release the body as soon as we can.<eos> There is another reason that we stopped by.<eos> What is it?<eos> We've already told you everything we know.<eos> This may be difficult for you to hear.
Then why don't I believe you?<eos> You hid it under our noses when we're barely scraping by?<eos> It was for all of us, for when I got out.<eos> Well, what's happened to it?<eos> One of you must've taken it!
They're like dogs, they like being stroked.<eos> But for God's sake, don't let 'em hump your leg.<eos> - I'm not.<eos> Nothing happened.<eos> - Mind if I join you handsome chaps?
- So, we got the bastard.<eos> - Cheers.<eos> - Cheers.<eos> Yes.<eos> Sorry, lads, I'll be with you in a minute.
- These are tight.<eos> Gun!<eos> - Oh, shit!<eos> - Get it!<eos> Which one of you jalapeño hookers grabbed my boob?
Ladies, all right.<eos> How're we doing?<eos> You guys good?<eos> You guys good?<eos> I've seen a lot of you out there taking pictures of yourselves with your newly-found phones.
This doesn't look like your prison anymore, does it, Boss?<eos> Not that it ever was.<eos> The way you let these animals walk all over us.<eos> Oh, this is my fault?<eos> Huh? Which one of you geniuses brought in a fucking gun?
Remember, you can always rely on us at Mulctuary Money Management.<eos> Now, if you'll excuse me, I will leave you alone on this mostly deserted dock to await for your taxi to your Aunt Josephine's house.<eos> She's not meeting us here?<eos> Strangely, she said she'd be unable to come to the dock, and I didn't think it polite to ask why.<eos> Perhaps she's planning a surprise party for you children.
Rip Hunter.<eos> Yes.<eos> He said the Spear could alter reality itself... that it was too powerful for any man or woman to possess, so we broke it into four separate pieces.<eos> Mr. Hunter took one...<eos> And took the rest of you to three different time periods.
- You're a white Martian?<eos> - I am not like them.<eos> You need to believe me.<eos> I spared you so you can rot in a cell for all eternity.<eos> This is Leslie Willis coming to you alive, and wired.
- Yes, she was.<eos> She's the White Martian.<eos> Now you really better put that away.<eos> But it could be her.<eos> It could be any of you.
I knew you that you were a little full of yourself, like, a little bit.<eos> - Full of myself? - But this is off the charts...<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - I'm not jealous. Okay? I'm angry, because you have an unfair double standard.<eos> Yeah. You're right, I don't hold you and Mxy to the same standard, because I expect bad behavior from him, but from you, - I expect much, much better.
Oh, you use half this much gusto in springing my dad, you'll have your sister back for game night.<eos> Kara!<eos> We're done here.<eos> You know what'll be fun?<eos> Finding out which one of you loves her more.
- I can re-purpose it to beam us onboard the Daxamite spacecraft.<eos> That's why we need your help.<eos> Give us access to the projector and we bring you aboard.<eos> That sounds like a great plan.<eos> One that we can carry out without you.
No need-no need for anybody to freak out here.<eos> Stop.<eos> Who are you?<eos> How'd you find us?<eos> I didn't, I didn't find you...
And should any of her suitors fail to meet my expectations, I'll compel them to the priesthood.<eos> Oh, look, Harvest Girls.<eos> I assume you speak on behalf of your Ancestors.<eos> Provided that you've come in peace.<eos> Well, that depends on you, doesn't it?
And how long, exactly, am I to play battery?<eos> You still don't get it, do you, Klaus?<eos> You're not a battery.<eos> You're a sacrifice.<eos> Tell me, which of you will die to stop me?
Everything we have of value is in that room.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You're not gonna be honest with us?<eos> Either of you?
I agree with Saxe.<eos> James St. Patrick killed Greg in a jealous rage and the jury will understand.<eos> Who gives a fuck if Valdes gets disbarred?<eos> It's a small price to pay for her indiscretions.<eos> Love triangle would have been a great narrative, except, all of you assholes knew
Then you will never be ready to leave.<eos> Do you really think that door, or any other, leads to freedom?<eos> Unless you master your past, you will always be a slave.<eos> Loyalty is more than a virtue, it, it's a religion.<eos> And every one of you is an instrument of its divine retribution.
What... what's a PDF?<eos> All right. Get dressed.<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> Sandy Gagic here.<eos> As most of you are already aware, several nude photos of Natalie James have been leaked online.
It happens.<eos> Are you still fighting now?<eos> No.<eos> I moved on. I'm wondering why the Frost Fair's on this part of the river.<eos> I bet that at least one of you knows who paid Kitty to take people out on the ice.
Get the hell out of here.<eos> How could you know that?<eos> Because we're gonna make it happen.<eos> Jesus fuck.<eos> I have all the research for you.
A test?<eos> To know who I'm dealing with.<eos> Now is not the time.<eos> This is not your business.<eos> I came here last week with an offer to assist you...
And your vaudevillian is in love with aurora.<eos> I've seen him resist the extremes of his own pain.<eos> But when I threatened her back at my apartment, He became compliant immediately.<eos> That's not even his failure; It's yours for letting the two work together.<eos> As far as I'm concerned, I cannot trust the lot of you.
The back of a pharmacy on saint-germain.<eos> You could redirect your men there.<eos> There are 100 black markets in paris; It's not plausible.<eos> I know it's a lot to ask.<eos> I'll think of something. This will be the last thing that I do for you.
Thank you.<eos> I'll dispatch the radio teams.<eos> If they're broadcasting locally, we'll find them right away.<eos> Go!<eos> I'm speaking to you now. Because it's time you knew the truth.
If they're broadcasting locally, we'll find them right away.<eos> Go!<eos> I'm speaking to you now. Because it's time you knew the truth.<eos> France will soon be entirely. Under german occupation.<eos> Their victory depends entirely on you.
Was the technology excellent?<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah, it was.<eos> We are literally the only police department in the entire world with a $2 million jacket hanging in our closet.<eos> Right?<eos> But the real victory belongs to all of you.
It's not exactly a contact sport, but I'd still wear some protection.<eos> And now, a prize that even Prince Liam, doesn't want to win an art viewing with prince Liam,<eos> Oh, my, it's the fair ladies.<eos> That's my ex-wife and her friends.<eos> And finally, for those of you who are fans of the undead...
Like everybody coming together to create something beautiful and memorable.<eos> And what would that look like, O visionary warrior?<eos> You want to grunt an actual idea, maybe?<eos> So as you can see, it's, like, way less crowded out here than it is in the dorms.<eos> And also, we have a thriving artistic community, which I know is so important to you gays.
Ain't gonna happen unless you all looking at me.<eos> I need ten eyes, right here.<eos> The slick one ain't looking yet.<eos> I can stand here all day waiting, so you better get your dude over there in line.<eos> The longer we wait, the more of you going to Poo.
You, with the boobs.<eos> You, too.<eos> - Me?<eos> - No, her.<eos> One of you has an opinion, the rest of you are gonna suffer for it.
This shows that the streets aren't safe for any of you.<eos> - Yeah, right. - Please... stay hidden.<eos> We can't trust anyone anymore.<eos> Ordinary people did this.<eos> But I am here for you all, to keep you safe however I can.
Get it?<eos> Girl on girl.<eos> - What?<eos> - So, like, Hulk Hogan?<eos> If one of you turns out to be Hulk Hogan, I've hit the fucking jackpot.
I'll come grab you before the fight.<eos> Look after yourself today!<eos> Stay hydrated.<eos> See ya in a bit.<eos> So which one of you Girl Scouts is game for a little cuddle then?
If you tap long enough, you will always find a weak spot.<eos> How else do you think I found your freezer?<eos> You were in the Corps.<eos> I was a Ranger myself.<eos> But we had a lot of respect for you fellas.
"Shades of Blue"...<eos> I told you a corrupt politician was gonna come to you asking you to let the mobster walk.
He tells you he'll reach out.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Eventually.<eos> Caddie?<eos> Either one of you seen Caddie?
Sorry.<eos> My partner got ahead of herself.<eos> Jesus, Harlee, why don't you just throw me down the stairs, save us both the trouble?<eos> I might... what are you doing bringing Verco here?<eos> I can't seem to shake either of you.
I prefer to lead by example.<eos> Harlee, don't even think about it.<eos> Now you've got a choice.<eos> Let's think about what you do next.<eos> You can waste a bunch of cops, assuming they don't waste you back, you spend the rest of your life in solitary, or we can have a conversation.
I mean, as far as I'm concerned, you can head back to the bench.<eos> Okay, coach, but unless you know how to replace a distributor cap on a '96 Civic, this engine's not turning over.<eos> That's gonna make up for selling out the people that risked their lives for you every damn day?<eos> All I've ever cared about is protecting this family.<eos> Look I shouldn't have lied to you, and I'm sorry.
How did he surprise you today?<eos> Quince went in five minutes ago.<eos> How'd you get him here?<eos> I told him Adrian came home on his own.<eos> He can't know I went to you.
That little party that you threw the other night sent his son into surgery.<eos> He survived.<eos> Then stop while you're ahead.<eos> We know Bianchi's in the country.<eos> So what we're gonna do is we're gonna play a fun little game called "The truth will set you free."
What the hell, bro?<eos> Last man out, lawyer's floor is completely clear.<eos> I thought cops had bad hours.<eos> Can I help you gentlemen?<eos> Detectives, what can I do you for?
Mom, you practically have me on house arrest.<eos> It's almost over.<eos> And hopefully, at the end of today, we're smiling.<eos> Well, how?<eos> Did you find out who shot at you?
- Is your cartel after us?<eos> It is not my cartel, and no one is after us, pal.<eos> Uh, hopefully, we're only here a few months.<eos> Why did you tell us the real reason we're here?<eos> - Because you're too smart for bullshit.
So, you know, what's not to like?<eos> I know. I... I know.<eos> Linda, I have to call you back. Let me call you back.<eos> Fuck!<eos> Either of you, you fuck with my daughter, you come near my house again, it'll be you the vultures are picking at.
So, I take it you got through customs okay, Mr. Heimel?<eos> You guys must really stand out in those liveries.<eos> Yeah, I would've gone with something a little more... incognito.<eos> Where can we have a little fun around here?<eos> - Um... - What kind of fun are you referring to?
What else are we transporting other than the Heimels, Mr. Gold?<eos> Diamonds.<eos> A fistful.<eos> Where can we have a little fun around here?<eos> What kind of fun are you referring to?
They took me out for a pint.<eos> Flying Squad detectives and brass.<eos> They acted like I was crew.<eos> That simple.<eos> To to you lot, I was only ever...
We got three phases.<eos> Phase one is intel, phase two is the takedown, phase three is the getaway.<eos> Have a look around ya.<eos> Look at each other.<eos> Each and every one of you has a skill set that is going to come in handy.
So the really good news is you didn't do anything.<eos> Go back and tell the angry tree lobby it was all crazy Julia.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Look, I got what I wanted.<eos> The rest was all a favor to you. So banish me forever.
Who wanted to get back at Cheryl for torpedoing your promotion.<eos> Who wanted payback for her ruining your marriage.<eos> Now, if you wanna see more of your kids, maybe you wanna make a deal on a manslaughter rap.<eos> If so, I advise you to step right up.<eos> I only need one of you to confirm the facts.
Thank you, Chief.<eos> I'm not finished!<eos> Your mayor... is a damn liar.<eos> Byron...<eos> And if he gets his way, these monsters that he says just don't exist... well they are going to come down and they are going to destroy each and every one of you.
Wait, is this really the most important thing we could be doing right now?<eos> I mean, The Beast is still out there waiting for us...<eos> The Beast can wait for five minutes.<eos> You are all Kings and Queens of Fillory.<eos> Well, almost all of you.
So apparently, he left curses behind.<eos> Here, actually.<eos> So you think Eliot might be cursed?<eos> I mean, she was vague, but I mean...<eos> Did either of you notice that Eliot started acting strangely once he took a drink from the goblet?
Look, just imagine dicks, okay?<eos> With one dick, you're just jerking yourself off, but with three dicks, suddenly you've got six people having sex.<eos> Which is more powerful?<eos> I think your metaphor literally doesn't make any fucking sense. It doesn't have to.<eos> It just distracted you long enough for Alice to power up the spell, which is all the shield charm has to do.
What's the plan?<eos> I stand before you this evening as vice presidential candidate, as the First Lady of the United States, and most of all... as a citizen of this great country.<eos> Despite the violent incident at the voting center in Knoxville, which the President is attending to as we speak, we want to assure anyone who's considering not voting that it is not only safe to vote, it is your duty to do so.<eos> It doesn't matter if you're a Democrat. It doesn't matter if you're a Republican.<eos> Our nation needs you to vote today.
- I'm from Belgium. - Oh.<eos> How do you know they're footballers?<eos> Well, do you not recognise them?<eos> They're in football outfits.<eos> He doesn't recognise you.
Stop!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> God.<eos> The French Secret Service didn't do a job as good as this.<eos> I'm not talking to any of you.
- Yes, Lindisfarne.<eos> We'll gloss over that.<eos> But then we've also got...<eos> the main man.<eos> The man we have lined up for you, he is the lead singer of the biggest rock band in the world, AC/DC.
The whole point of making hackmods is to sell forced labor with superhuman skills, right?<eos> So? - So...<eos> How marketable do you think we'd be if we could use our tech against our buyers?<eos> No wonder you hate us Basics.<eos> Some of you are worse than others.
Who's behind it?<eos> I get you're trying to protect your people, but so am I.<eos> This green shit?<eos> It's all over the zone where I come from.<eos> And if the people who use it are here, they got worse plans for you than any Basic ever could.
What if the monsters look just like you?<eos> Ah, so we can drop the facade, then?<eos> Oh, let's.<eos> You do realize this means we'll have to kill you and your team.<eos> After we make one of you explain how to work the device, of course.
Like I did once for you, Lachlan.<eos> This the man?<eos> - Yeah, but we're not... We're not, like, together.<eos> Johnny's being hunted.<eos> Like you all once were.
A Squad, we can't hear you.<eos> We're taking fire!<eos> Retreating now!<eos> Heading to the Armory.<eos> We'll join you when we can.
I was the best man...<eos> So you knew him well enough to know that he wouldn't have thrown in with us if we couldn't be trusted to do the right thing.<eos> Yeah, he took us down. He turned us in.<eos> But he also helped us escape because he realized that he'd made a mistake.<eos> He realized, like you said, there were bigger bads out there than you.
That's pretty brilliant.<eos> Well, I am an android.<eos> Anyway, I suggest we postpone the celebration, as there are several Ishida cruisers rapidly approaching our position.<eos> Roger that.<eos> Coming to you.
I'd like to use your ship's communications to let my people know what's going on.<eos> That's not gonna happen.<eos> They need to know I'm not dead.<eos> And they will, when you show up back on your colony.<eos> We've assigned quarters to each of you.
I'm talking about the fact that you're keeping us under guard.<eos> It's for your own protection.<eos> Do you expect us to believe that?<eos> One of your buddies just got killed.<eos> Any one of you could be next.
On the contrary.<eos> It could have everything to do with you.<eos> How far would you go to save your people?<eos> Imagine them under threat.<eos> They turn to you but the odds seem hopeless until... you discover a piece of technology that could change everything.
But Five, I didn't kill him.<eos> So, did you decide to take the deal?<eos> Not yet. Care to come with us and try to convince the others it's a mistake?<eos> I've said my piece.<eos> It's up to you now.
That's pretty brilliant.<eos> Well, I am an android.<eos> Anyway, I suggest we postpone the celebration, as there are several Ishida cruisers rapidly approaching our position.<eos> Roger that.<eos> Coming to you.
Cepheus-5, this is the "Raza."<eos> You're welcome.<eos> We received word that Ferrous Corp had started launching strikes on rival assets in the outer colonies.<eos> Figured it was just a matter of time before they set their sights on us.<eos> Well, fortunately for you, we were in the area when they did.
Where's Turrence?<eos> So you think you'll be able to sell this to the workers?<eos> Yeah. I'm sure I can convince them that this is their best option.<eos> Have to say, you surprise me.<eos> Your reputation may precede you, but it's a long way from reality.
It was one of my people?<eos> Uh, it was someone who wanted to trigger this conflict,<eos> - and they succeeded.<eos> - But why?<eos> Listen up, I've got news for you.
This is the price to be paid for trying to take away our freedom.<eos> Well, well, speak of the devil.<eos> He and his people are outsiders.<eos> They work as hired guns for the corporations.<eos> They seem to think they can come here and tell you what's best for you.
Even if we could escape, where would we go?<eos> We got contacts in the Outer Colonies, the ones that have recently declared independence.<eos> And they'd help us?<eos> They already agreed to take you in.<eos> It's a new life for you and your people, one where no one has any power over you.
We'll handle it.<eos> She's going with you.<eos> We just told you...<eos> Look, she's one person.<eos> She won't slow you down.
They could cause further problems moving forward.<eos> Yes, I'm well aware of that.<eos> Tracking them down will be our next priority.<eos> In the meantime, I'll have my office work up a new authentication protocol,<eos> - just for you.
What the hell is the G.A. gonna do about it?<eos> What they can.<eos> We've set up patrols to monitor the situation, but this corporate war has stretched us mighty thin.<eos> We can't be everywhere at once.<eos> - I know why you're there, and I've got news for you.
I don't know yet.<eos> Friends, would you gather, please?<eos> - Mrs. Raven?<eos> - Not right now.<eos> Most of you have been coming here for years.
- Not right now.<eos> Most of you have been coming here for years.<eos> Most of you know me, just as I know you and your families.<eos> We know each other too well for me to... preach.<eos> Instead, I will talk to you here.
My whole life I believed there was something bigger out there and now I find out it's all true.<eos> Remind me to punch you even harder than I usually do.<eos> You kept crucial information from me about who you are, where you're from, when you're from and about my daughter.<eos> Molly's safety is absolute paramount.<eos> Which is why none of you are coming anywhere near her.
She was a warrior, a champion, and her life was cut short by the senseless actions of this man before you.<eos> Murderer!<eos> This is insanity.<eos> The Lieutenant died so that all of us may live.<eos> She sacrificed herself for you.
Under no circumstances are the ship's operations to be interfered with.<eos> All ships, please acknowledge.<eos> This is an MCRN Priority Alert.<eos> Well, well, well.<eos> What the hell makes you so gosh darn special?
Stone's just starting that trial now.<eos> Part of our opening statement will be making an emotional connection with our jurors.<eos> I'll be telling them about your daughter.<eos> Taking them through what happened to her that day.<eos> It may be hard for you to hear.
I pretended I wasn't home, but I'm afraid if I go back to school tomorrow, something bad might happen.<eos> This is all gonna work out.<eos> We're gonna charge Keo with murder.<eos> His visit to your apartment the other day, and the blood on the gun you turned in are key pieces of evidence.<eos> But we can't proceed without you.
These kids still paying back grudges from five years ago.<eos> So what are you going to do?<eos> We'll stay with some friends in Wrigleyville for a few days.<eos> After that, I don't know.<eos> But I've done all I can do for you now.
I'm trying to get a hold of Jasper.<eos> He's giving me the silent treatment and not responding to my texts.<eos> - Oh, for shit's sake!<eos> - I know.<eos> As impossible as it is to imagine your supremely eloquent emoji texts going unanswered, the palace private cameras are not a messaging service for you two.
You think you know people, huh?<eos> It's like you can want something so badly, but, you know, sometimes love just isn't enough.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I forget you're children.<eos> Your simple minds can't imagine what it's like to have everything you care about just taken away from you.
He's in Texas?<eos> Wow, you're a bad stalker, Max.<eos> There's two things the Slop won't do.<eos> Alert the proper authorities of my flight pattern or step foot in Texas.<eos> I'll drop you here.
I know a shady deal when I see one.<eos> I was one of the loudest voices against the Louisiana Purchase.<eos> Earl, what are you even doing here?<eos> I thought you lived at the diner.<eos> Well, thank God the girls asked me to check on Han checking on you too 'cause now this black male is about to blackmail you.
- It's an expression.<eos> - Yeah? Whose?<eos> You should be scared.<eos> If you're not, you got no idea what you're getting into, sweetheart.<eos> I survived the wasteland without you and your guns.
That's not gonna happen.<eos> Too much has been sacrificed...<eos> I know what's been sacrificed, boy.<eos> That's why you'll leave.<eos> Or I'll feed every goddamn one of you to the crows.
To be eligible, all blood donations must be up to date.<eos> - The Partnership... - That's it. Next.<eos> Shit!<eos> The Partnership.<eos> We're here for you.
Eric made the guy who sent the photo he need you to come back here and work the profile.<eos> Will do.<eos> La Gare d'Entrevaux, s'il Vous plaît.<eos> Bien sur, Madame.<eos> Hey girls, any of you into dancing or singing?
You and your loser friends are done.<eos> You know, you think you're so much better than us?<eos> We were making ten bucks an hour, no benefits, carrying around millions of dollars for rich fat cats like your boss.<eos> All we were doing was evening the score.<eos> Linc Richards was one of you, you pathetic son of a bitch!
I was getting us ticket books.<eos> You take four, they expect you to fill four.<eos> What beat are you guys working today?<eos> We're on a traffic car.<eos> I have a special assignment for you.
What am I supposed to tell them?<eos> The truth.<eos> Mark.<eos> Peter.<eos> I can't get to you.
Yeah, absolutely. Erm...<eos> I mean... she'd been coming here since...<eos> Well, forever, really.<eos> She'd been a Saturday girl.<eos> So she was working for you just prior to her disappearance?
We were definitely in all evening.<eos> You remember.<eos> We talked about how awful it'd be to be sleeping in some muddy field.<eos> We did, yeah.<eos> Were either of you ever aware of Mia taking drugs?
Nah.<eos> You rented that place for Mia Hinkin.<eos> I barely knew the girl.<eos> Her family own these fields.<eos> She collected the rent from you on a regular basis.
What sort of adventure does the mayor have you on?<eos> I've chosen Grace as my Middleton Foundation. Oh.<eos> That sounds like quite an honour.<eos> It means I'm leaving my mark. Hmm.<eos> Well, I wish I could join you, but I was sent out for some very specific ingredients by a guest who wants to spend some time in my kitchen.
Molly drew this.<eos> She is quite the gifted artist.<eos> And meticulous.<eos> She dates all of her notebooks.<eos> She drew this weeks before she ever met you.
Agent Thomas...<eos> The Horseman... has a head.<eos> Tell the others to open the way.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - I'll bring him to you.
None of this changes the fact that you kept crucial information from me.<eos> About who you are, where you're from, when you're from, and about my daughter.<eos> And that you think there is a world in which I'm gonna let you take her anywhere near any of this.<eos> I assure you upon my honor, every one of us will be with you for every step of this journey, and Molly's safety is absolute paramount.<eos> Yeah. Which is why none of you are coming anywhere near her.
This just got a hell of a lot more interesting.<eos> Heading into a conclave, it's a dicey proposition.<eos> I'd like to commend Baron Broadmore for moving his family into a cottage two and a half miles south of his compound.<eos> He's right to fear that someone might try to harm them.<eos> Each of you have taken precautions to protect what is yours.
It means we're screwed, kid.<eos> There are three more inside.<eos> This is the end of the line!<eos> You can get off or you'll be carried out in pieces.<eos> It's up to you.
No unnecessary risks, Hannah.<eos> Just the necessary ones?<eos> We're putting together a task force at Grand Forks...<eos> FBI and ATF...<eos> But that's still over an hour's flight from you.
I thought you guys were in trouble.<eos> It's like a country club!<eos> We're being reassigned, not waterboarded.<eos> Okay, well, Blair plans to continue with the program.<eos> I told him I wouldn't do it without you.
They should have left for the sale by now. We should go in.<eos> - We go in now, we blow this op.<eos> - Exactly. In time.<eos> Jane knows what she's doing.<eos> The FBI wants Shepherd. Not the Kings, not you.
I'm sorry I've been complaining so much lately.<eos> 'Cause I really enjoyed having you as my sidekicks this year.<eos> You have really great taste in music, by the way.<eos> I guess I'm just, um... I'm a little... overwhelmed.<eos> Not about meeting you guys... I can't wait to meet you guys.
I don't need you to tell me she's gone.<eos> And I will never move on, so stop asking me to.<eos> She's my wife.<eos> She was my life.<eos> And I love you two, but if you tell me to move on again you will not be welcome in our home.
564 homicides.<eos> 14 cases of deadly arson.<eos> That's just Chicago.<eos> So, all that matters to me now is making those numbers smaller... no matter what the cost.<eos> Listen... I've made each and every one of you folks a crap-load of money.
- intravenous vitamins... - What kind of fucking doctor are you?<eos> Would you like to see the sonogram?<eos> Obstetrics weren't really my specialty.<eos> I was... more of a research fellow, but it's a girl.<eos> That deranged midwife told me the opposite, but she was also convinced the baby was one of you.
It's a hard thing to understand, since you're not one of us.<eos> All right, then... enjoy your reunion.<eos> I need a minute with Olivia.<eos> You hate them.<eos> Hey, I guess I don't see what you see, since I'm not one of you.
What?<eos> No, we're not molesting your robot.<eos> - What?<eos> - It kissed me, I didn't kiss it.<eos> I got something even better for you to fondle.
Sorry, no exceptions.<eos> Oh. Except Debbie, because she's the star, and she has a baby.<eos> - Bullshit!<eos> - Can we live in reality for a second?<eos> We gotta shoot this thing in five weeks, most of you don't know how to act, none of you can wrestle.
- Me, too, but not British.<eos> Another one.<eos> All right, come on.<eos> We need to start thinking about the show.<eos> The gimmicks, the matches, who fights who, what props are you guys gonna be throwing around.
- My hair. - For who?<eos> For me.<eos> Self-esteem, hello?<eos> I can't look at you anymore.<eos> Any of you.
It's not Monopoly money.<eos> This is about accountability, Sam. And trust and thrift.<eos> Oh, my God. You sound like a Protestant.<eos> Is that a bad thing?<eos> If any of you have any information about the whereabouts of my video camera, or if any of you happened to steal it, bring it the fuck back now.
If he's really planning to kill Emma...<eos> We're going to have to stop him.<eos> But that doesn't mean he has to be hurt.<eos> And neither one of our children need to be harmed.<eos> Look, I came to you for help because I trust you.
Andre Keyes abandoned Louie for the last three years.<eos> Louie was bounced from one abusive home to another his entire life.<eos> We're not just gonna hand him over.<eos> I understand how upsetting this is...<eos> For both of you, but I think it's important for you to know you are not legally a guardian of Louie's, since only Ms. Dawson's name appears on the foster application.
Tell Sara Alice I said goodbye.<eos> I'm gonna miss her.<eos> Before I speak, I think... It's only fair to give my siblings to voice their support or concerns.<eos> So I humbly defer to my brother,<eos> His Royal Highness Prince Liam, whose opinion matters to me immensely, as it should to you too.
A number of concerned people are worried that if you watch the Baudelaire orphans steal a sailboat and sail across Lake Lachrymose in the middle of Hurricane Herman...<eos> We're gonna steal a sailboat, sail across Lake Lachrymose in the middle of Hurricane Herman.<eos> you might be tempted to do such a thing yourself.<eos> We're stealing these, too.<eos> So allow me to offer you a piece of advice, even though I don't know anything about you.
We're gonna steal a sailboat, sail across Lake Lachrymose in the middle of Hurricane Herman.<eos> you might be tempted to do such a thing yourself.<eos> We're stealing these, too.<eos> So allow me to offer you a piece of advice, even though I don't know anything about you.<eos> Do not take a sailboat that does not belong to you.
What a relief.<eos> We don't know how to thank you.<eos> I can think of a way.<eos> Oh, no!<eos> You can stop faking your death and running away and rescuing each other and making me ferry around this godforsaken lake searching for you.
What are you doing?<eos> And a man who, upon hearing the word "Nero," could suddenly play an instrument he'd never studied.<eos> Dolores, put down that violin!<eos> The Encyclopedia Hypnotica does not mention the fatal accident that happened during the Baudelaires' time at Lucky Smells Lumbermill.<eos> "Fatal" is a word here which means "caused the death of one person who... it is my solemn duty to inform you... was not Phil."
Officer.<eos> I think you children will have a good home here.<eos> I hope so anyway, because I've just received a promotion.<eos> Vice President of Orphan Affairs.<eos> Which means I'll be too busy to check in on you orphans.
- Mmm. It's been years.<eos> - Tell me, truck driver...<eos> - I said my name was Evander.<eos> Did you ever know a woman, truck driver, who took your heart and rattled it like a baby in a cage?<eos> Who joined you for years on a sequence of heists and schemes until the two of you were forced apart by circumstance, and also because you ran off in the middle of the night with a bunch of her valuables?
They've seen you dance.<eos> I don't know what's going on here, but we need to...<eos> Baude-liars!<eos> - We need to...<eos> - I'm talking to you, lumber brats.
Something up here?<eos> How about I go get my sketchpad, and I'll scribble out a little bit more of my sanity for you?<eos> Miss Goines...<eos> I thought I was part of a team, not just the Primary that you outsource for all your time-travel technical support.<eos> I have one last show for you.
This time.<eos> You're too late.<eos> What's done cannot be undone.<eos> I feel nothing for you.<eos> And there is nothing in morality or causality to stop me from killing you.
I found him.<eos> At last, the day is upon us.<eos> The hour of reckoning.<eos> The moment of return.<eos> And I know that many of you have doubted and feared and waited in great anticipation in this timeless place, but wait no more.
Impossible."<eos> You did the right thing.<eos> Doesn't feel like the right thing.<eos> This is a game-changer for us, the step-up that we needed.<eos> You said that there were three of you.
He'll sell, no questions asked.<eos> This guy will not remember a thing, okay?<eos> You and I need to talk.<eos> The fantasy of being an operative is very different from the reality.<eos> This morning, some of you completed the scenario, a few did not.
It's powerful.<eos> And power always has a cost.<eos> You have to be willing to be used... violated... culpable, and even betrayed to successfully seduce an asset.<eos> But no matter how successful you are in completing your mission, waking up and accepting what happened the night before is one of the hardest parts of the job.<eos> Now, for the next few weeks, every one of you will cross a line you thought was impossible.
It isn't heavy.<eos> I've got all my worldly goods in it, but it isn't heavy.<eos> And if it isn't carried a certain way, it falls right open, so I better keep it.<eos> I've come to know the exact knack of it.<eos> I am ecstatic beyond measure that I'm going to belong to you and your sister.
He'll find a way to come home.<eos> Maybe you should make sure everything is ready for him.<eos> Don't you have any friends out there that could help Franz?<eos> They were supposed to arrive by train yesterday, but they didn't.<eos> Of course. You were everywhere in Paris, but now, when we need you? Nowhere to be found.
For Sabine.<eos> A friend like you.<eos> At a time like this.<eos> It means a lot to me too.<eos> To be here for both of you.
How were you going to get us off the train?<eos> You were wanted fugitives.<eos> Political dissidents<eos> I urgently needed to question.<eos> You think I came to you to put more blood on my hands?
This is something I trusted you with.<eos> I do my best. She has such.<eos> An affectionate disposition;<eos> She's ready to love another child.<eos> It would be good for both of you.
Knocked off a tank or two.<eos> Nothing compared to what you lot get up to.<eos> That's a compliment to your late leader, colonel sinclair.<eos> The resourcefulness... The resilience you had.<eos> Most of you, anyway.
That's sweet. It is, isn't it?<eos> Ooh, I gotta wrap this up.<eos> I got a date.<eos> We good?<eos> I'll stop touching you.
Good boy!<eos> Why, thank you, Ringo.<eos> Oh, my!<eos> Oh, Ringo!<eos> I, Francie. .. Take you, Douglas, as you are... To love and to cherish... to have and to hold...
You're right.<eos> It's none of my business if you cheated on me with her.<eos> What?<eos> Why should it even bother me?<eos> Come on! I didn't cheat on you with her.
- On the phone.<eos> - Over where?<eos> No, son.<eos> She's out of the car.<eos> She's looking for you.
Real impressed.<eos> You know, I'm glad you brought that up.<eos> Uh, I've actually been meaning to talk to you about that.<eos> You know, i-i was thinking, with the numbers so high, maybe it's time i get off the road and take an office position.<eos> Well, we... we really need you on the road.
Icouldsmellit.<eos> Hey, dad.<eos> Hey, pal.<eos> What are you, uh... What are you doing here?<eos> Oh. Well, I saw you...
His name is buddy.<eos> Let's see. He belongs to...<eos> Comeon,Ethan.<eos> Icansmellyou inthere.<eos> I don't want to leave you here.
We have to do that.<eos> I am not going to her stupid suburban shithole life.<eos> But there's nothing nuts about that.<eos> Look, look, just... all of the shit that you've been through... and you've come out the other side better than she'll ever be.<eos> And it's a great chance for your daughter to see who you are.
I'm not going in there to tell him.<eos> It was your idea.<eos> No, it was my idea for you to tell him.<eos> - He likes you more than me. - He doesn't like anybody.<eos> Sorry, sir, we know you said never to disturb you, or to come in without good cause. Or to speak without first... asking ourselves whether our thoughts were absolutely necessary.
- Ruth loves to go to the California Pizza Kitchen. - Paul Schaffer:<eos> Yeah. And they say that her favorite dish there is the veal scallo-Ponzi.<eos> Listen, I have something to tell you that's really important.<eos> I have your money! I can get it to you.<eos> Okay, I guess you're not there.
When did I tell you you could call me Bill?<eos> - Seriously.<eos> - What is it you want to say, Gavin?<eos> You still live up to your book.<eos> And I lied to you.
- Thanks, Bill.<eos> It was nice meeting you.<eos> - Nice meeting you.<eos> I'm sorry I talked to you that way.<eos> I had no call to treat you like that.
Jesus.<eos> My cousin's.<eos> So look...<eos> My family... We have a lot of friends.<eos> So there's gonna be nowhere that you can go that we won't be able to find you.
Hey.<eos> What the hell is going on?<eos> It's all good.<eos> I've been calling Thomas's phone for an hour.<eos> D, I didn't want to worry you, okay?
Bleeding?<eos> Yeah I know.<eos> That's what I thought...<eos> Faris, you're breaking up.<eos> We can't hear you.
Come in please.<eos> Come in.<eos> Do you read me?<eos> Are you reading, landing team?<eos> Yes, we read you.
Hello!<eos> Not too bad.<eos> However, I have to move you, and that is annoying to me.<eos> Fortunately, you have not made me angry.<eos> Should you ever make me angry I will skin you alive while your mother watches.
Stairs!<eos> Just run!<eos> Run! Run! Run!<eos> Grenade!<eos> I hate you, I hate you so much!
Woah woah what's happening?<eos> Did you just shut down the mercury?<eos> Pete?<eos> You are a younger man but you must learn to be wary of a man like me.<eos> It's not me that wants to kill you, it's Henry.
Nick?<eos> Stop!<eos> Stop. Please.<eos> I don't know what I am.<eos> I don't want to hurt you, Jenny.
Yes.<eos> I have made so many many mistakes.<eos> But not this time.<eos> Not you.<eos> I don't want to hurt you.
I'd say it's frozen.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Felix Faust would take precautions against locator spells.<eos> There's another way, but it involves asking a favor of someone that I don't have the best relationship with.<eos> Someone else dislikes you?
Whatever you do, You do not have to.<eos> There is always another way.<eos> It is my business, boy, Forget that you know.<eos> In the end, if I do not, You have to take responsibility.<eos> I can no longer cover you.
- I'm your blackmailer.<eos> And your salvation.<eos> You cooperate with me, no one will ever see this video.<eos> Now, my research suggests that, as deputy headmaster of one of Edinburgh's leading private schools, you earn, near enough, £70,000 per annum.<eos> It's not in my interest to squeeze you too hard, and it's not in your interest to provoke me.
"Why wouldn't he?"<eos> Daniel?<eos> It's me.<eos> I'm not here.<eos> - What do you mean, you're not here?
It just occurred to me that I'm illiterate<eos> And I've never actually had to spell it out loud before<eos> Gaston<eos> Oh, LeFou, you're the best.<eos> How is it no girl has snatched you up yet?
Please!<eos> Come on.<eos> You came back.<eos> Of course I came back.<eos> I'll never leave you again.
She blames herself for Missy's death.<eos> You had your own guilt to deal with.<eos> But the time for blame is over.<eos> When I go back...<eos> I still want you in my life.
I'm coming, Kate.<eos> Lisa, I thought you were dead. Where's Javier?<eos> The shark ripped him to pieces.<eos> I have the winch cable.<eos> Oh, I was so lost I thought I would never see you again.
Taylor, can you hear us?<eos> Taylor!<eos> Hello? - Can you hear me? Lisa?<eos> - Taylor, can you hear us?<eos> Lisa, I can hear you. Oh!
-Is this really happening?<eos> -It was so fucking tense.<eos> Dad.<eos> What are you doing with my phone? I just... nothing.<eos> Just looking for you.
What are you doing with my phone? I just... nothing.<eos> Just looking for you.<eos> -Why?<eos> -You know... -What's going on?<eos> -I don't know. Just looking for you. Just...
-We had lunch already.<eos> Listen, we just thought with the operation tomorrow and all, it would be best for Michael to come and stay with us for a while.<eos> -Work with us. Come on.<eos> -I think you should leave.<eos> We can't leave you here like this.
Five?<eos> I'll give you three days.<eos> Give you three days. -Okay, three days.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I told you I didn't want to bring you into this.
It's not what families do. Families work together.<eos> Families work together to bury the ugly stuff.<eos> Come on out, Beau. You... Just want to talk, you can trust me.<eos> I'm sorry, Uncle Paul.<eos> Families will do anything to protect each other and I don't want to hurt you, Beau, but what choice do I have?
Respectfully, Suzie, fuck this, okay?<eos> I'm going in.<eos> - No, Andy.<eos> - I'm going in!<eos> Why do you think they haven't called for you? Andy!
My left hand never misses its mark.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> Raees!<eos> What's up?<eos> Jairaj Seth wants you.
You are everyone's dream date.<eos> Sir, this is the beginning of organised crime.<eos> If Raees isn't stopped now, he'll burn the whole of Gujarat.<eos> After this terrible incident under your jurisdiction, are you teaching me?<eos> Now you give me in writing why I shouldn't be transferring you!
Well, at least you know you can if you want to.<eos> - Oh, God.<eos> - Don't be mad.<eos> Got you a little something.<eos> - I hate you.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you about the ring.<eos> I'm sorry about today.<eos> Tessa said she's not comfortable having Lily in the house.<eos> What?<eos> She doesn't want you alone with Lily.
Rita could be building Goldar as we speak.<eos> - Don't underestimate me or my team.<eos> - You can't stop him.<eos> She will have him dig up the crystal and life on earth will die.<eos> And we need you.
Start over.<eos> Erase that picture right now.<eos> - Jason, it can't be erased.<eos> - Then live with it.<eos> You did an awful thing. It doesn't make you an awful person.
How did you know?<eos> How did I know?<eos> I taught you. Don't you remember?<eos> How can you not remember that?<eos> Eurus, I don't remember you at all.
- I can't!<eos> - Don't panic!<eos> - But it feels right!<eos> I know, but we have to fix this.<eos> We have to make sure you don't get fired.
You should have seen your face in that picture.<eos> You were all...<eos> I'm not used to being tickled.<eos> Once at a corporate retreat. But those things always get weird.<eos> What? You've never been tickled?
Yondu?<eos> Thrusters are out.<eos> Guess I should be glad I was a skinny kid.<eos> Otherwise, you'd have delivered me to this maniac.<eos> You still reckon that's the reason I kept you around, you idiot?
I got you.<eos> You're okay. You're okay.<eos> I'm right here.<eos> Are you insane?<eos> Do you think that the protocol does not apply to you?
Okja!<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Okja!<eos> Okja! What did you say?<eos> I can't hear you!
- You were here the whole time?<eos> - Yes. That's bullshit.<eos> But we were, Elliot.<eos> You didn't answer me.<eos> - We didn't hear you!
I need you to go to the truck.<eos> No, Daddy, I got to go!<eos> Go someplace close where I can see ya, and be quick, okay?<eos> Outside?<eos> No one is going to see you, baby. It's okay.
You, you got this under control?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You better have.<eos> There's... there's one problem.<eos> I don't know you yet.
- What?<eos> As in "relationships."<eos> There is no "us."<eos> Batman and Joker are not a thing.<eos> I don't need you.
uh...<eos> I don't really spook.<eos> I'm Big Al.<eos> Danny.<eos> Don't think I've seen you around here before.
- What are you doing here?<eos> I've been waiting to talk to you.<eos> It... It really is me.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm not gonna hurt you. which means he's going to be pulling around the corner any second he's also my guard.
Back up.<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> - Isn't it obvious?<eos> he's not your brother.<eos> We don't want you here.
- What happened to you?<eos> - What happened to you?<eos> That's why I'm here.<eos> uh... Can you keep an eye on Joy for me?<eos> Wasn't he stalking you?
That it's my destiny.<eos> 'Cause if you really believe that you can take these sons of bitches out... then I have to believe, too.<eos> But going against them on your own, that's some foolish bullshit, no matter who you are.<eos> He's not alone.<eos> I can't ask anything more from you.
Now, if you had run away, run away like a scared child, you would have regretted it every day for the rest of your life.<eos> Now, relax.<eos> You just had a moment of weakness.<eos> Eh, it happens.<eos> I'm not gonna punish you for it.
we're in trouble here.<eos> What are you waiting for?<eos> You are about to fall into a trap you cannot escape.<eos> I don't understand what you're asking me to do.<eos> You weren't taught this.
You wanted someone to pay for the death of your mother and father.<eos> I didn't even know it was murder until after I left. but you were smart enough to know that airplanes don't drop from the sky for no reason.<eos> We're wasting our time here.<eos> Danny.<eos> If what you're saying is true... then why haven't I killed you already?
Y-you don't know shit.<eos> Is that how you say it?<eos> - "You don't know shit"?<eos> Say that again.<eos> I can't hear you.
The ghost.<eos> A hundred men out there call themselves Juba.<eos> I'm just a man.<eos> 35 U.S. casualties, angel of death.<eos> That's why they never find you.
We'll do our best, cap.<eos> Over and out.<eos> Out.<eos> Fuck you.<eos> Oh, fuck you...
Stay with me!<eos> This is not who you are.<eos> I know you.<eos> You died.<eos> I held you in my arms.
If you could just answer a couple of questions, it'd be a tremendous help.<eos> Okay.<eos> Closed door used to mean something.<eos> My apologies.<eos> In all the time we've known each other, I've never seen you like this.
For whatever it's worth, I'm glad you're here.<eos> What?<eos> The circumstances could be better.<eos> I'm just saying, you know, I'm glad we found each other.<eos> I'm not hugging you.
- No, I'm gonna meet you up there.<eos> - What?<eos> I can get through to her.<eos> - You back on that again?<eos> - We're not gonna leave you here.
Stop saying that.<eos> We're hiring a hundred people this month.<eos> - One of them might as well be you. - Right.<eos> Good.<eos> This doesn't mean you're in. You have to kill the interview.
Nice to have you.<eos> Now, now, guppies is just an affectionate term for you baby fishies.<eos> Soon, you will all grow to become powerful...<eos> - You're adorable.<eos> - I hate you.
Can you give me a hand?<eos> I told you, ma'am, I've no interest in breaking any laws.<eos> You know what, that's enough with the ma'am stuff, my name is Stella, okay?<eos> And I, Stella, would love your help.<eos> Please, okay? I won't turn you in, okay?
I'm good.<eos> Maybe you wanna take a minute between rounds, huh?<eos> Nah, nah, nah.<eos> All right, let's get on up out of here.<eos> - I'm gonna call you buster.
Yeah, somebody trained you really well.<eos> Now, don't you move or I'll be ass over teakettle, and we don't want that, do we?<eos> Come on now, aces.<eos> Look, I know you're scared, buddy.<eos> I promise, i ain't gonna hurt you.
- like where...<eos> - What thing?<eos> You know, where you're just like, you're like, it's like a "Why, I oughta," but, you know, it's no big deal.<eos> - Why, I oughta what?<eos> - Why, I oughta bludgeon you with a hammer.
He's never once flipped!<eos> - Here we go. - I do flips all the time.<eos> - You have never once flipped.<eos> - In the pool?<eos> Which you would not have done had I not warned you, thereby saving your life!
You don't think i can handle him?<eos> That's not it.<eos> That's what it feels like.<eos> Ana, I know full well that you can handle anything.<eos> And, uh, if you really wanna go, then I can't stop you.
Give me your hand.<eos> Did you do that?<eos> Great, isn't it?<eos> That's so pretty.<eos> I solemnly vow to love you faithfully and to keep you safe for as long as we both shall live.
I'd just rather skip that part.<eos> All you have to do is drop onto the sand without a sound.<eos> It's daytime.<eos> He has no reason to be playing his flute.<eos> No one's going to see you.
Would you mind if we rested in your humble home for the night?<eos> Uh, I...<eos> I can't feel my tail.<eos> This is the end.<eos> I don't blame you.
How's it going?<eos> Have you got Fred to bed OK?<eos> Could you er... pick up a loaf on your way home?<eos> OK.<eos> Look, kiss those boys for me and I'll try not to wake you if I'm late back, OK.
Some have mental health issues.<eos> It's challenging.<eos> But I've watched you in training, in pilot sessions, in real-life situations.<eos> You've got something special to offer, Beth.<eos> We need you.
How is she?<eos> She's good.<eos> - Keep working. - I will.<eos> Diana!<eos> Diana, I see you.
- So, who do you fight for in this war?<eos> I don't fight.<eos> You're here for profits then?<eos> No better place to be.<eos> Nowhere better to be than in a war where you don't take a side.
- No, you are not coming with me.<eos> What you're wearing isn't exactly undercover.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I would say she was pretty undercover on that battlefield.<eos> It's just gonna, we can't get you there.
What are you proposing?<eos> The tests I carried out, I want to do the same with Shirley Allardyce.<eos> If we find what we are looking for, then that means it is not safe to live here.<eos> We cannot let fear take hold.<eos> I would never hurt you.
Gonna give it up because you're scared?<eos> Because Misty Holloway trying to turn the crowd against you?<eos> 'Cause she's jealous?<eos> I know you can do it, Mylene.<eos> But if you give up... as much as I love you, I don't wanna see you no more.
I can't believe you're already in tenth grade.<eos> It's like time has flown by and stood still all at the same time.<eos> It's usually a father's hope that his son will follow in his footsteps.<eos> Thankfully, that won't be the case with us.<eos> I never meant to hurt you, Josh... but I have failed you in every way possible.
We're just real selective... who we choose to call our brother.<eos> So the question is... are you ready?<eos> Yes.<eos> What I wanted to hear.<eos> But keep your ink clean so they can't validate you.
I said hands, now, get them up!<eos> Aw, Jesus. Oh, Bill, it's you.<eos> Jesus, how you doing, man?<eos> Steve, what the hell are you doing out here?<eos> Aren't you tired of this Peter Pan bullshit?
I intend to mix the contents of his stomach with potassium oxide, calcium oxide and nitric acid.<eos> I'll know in 20 minutes. Come back when the church bell chimes.<eos> You did this.<eos> You will pay for this.No.<eos> No, because I have no fear to feed you with.
I'll know in 20 minutes. Come back when the church bell chimes.<eos> You did this.<eos> You will pay for this.No.<eos> No, because I have no fear to feed you with.<eos> No fear to give you and I will prove it.
Sing for me like you once did as the river caught your tongue.<eos> Ee neem sea wo ha ha. Suicide.<eos> That will teach you not to steal, won't it?<eos> You're not here. You are not here.<eos> I have no fear for you and I have no guilt for you.
I'm an old man, I would never survive.<eos> Tell me that's the reason.<eos> Brace, you were not born for freedom.<eos> You wouldn't know what to do with it.<eos> It would torture you.
Do you know, this is so old, I could even laugh at you?<eos> And yet you came outside to see me.<eos> Because, otherwise, you would've come to me and made very loud declarations.<eos> I would, yes.<eos> Is it my loudness that troubles you?
Shall we pray?<eos> I used to think we were the same person.<eos> We are.<eos> We're not.<eos> Now... I never want to see you again.
Okay, I'll try to remember.<eos> You will remember, because I have no other way to get back home.<eos> I said I'll try.<eos> 5:00! Is she always like this?<eos> No, I just think she doesn't like you.
Where are you going?<eos> Whatever's happening, it's worse for you guys.<eos> Stiles, where are you going?<eos> You're coming back, right?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I'd never leave you behind.
Attention, all passengers.<eos> The train will be arriving in 19 minutes.<eos> It's him.<eos> Can't believe I'm gone a couple days, the whole place falls apart.<eos> No, you were gone for three months.
Agent Diaz is here crying jailbreak.<eos> It wasn't me. It was Rhys.<eos> Hi, Alice.<eos> Do you want me to tell her it was Rhys?<eos> No, I don't want you involved.
We got him.<eos> Alice got him.<eos> We want a name. Who hired you?<eos> I get hired and paid anonymously, So you may as well just kill me now.<eos> No one's gonna kill you.
I have access to $3 million.<eos> And I need someone in your line of work to help me steal it.<eos> $3 million?<eos> In an offshore account in my name.<eos> Thomas, I underestimated you.
Anything you say may be used against you in a court of law.<eos> - Allie, don't do this.<eos> - You have the right to an attorney.<eos> - Don't do this.<eos> Don't do this! - If you cannot afford an attorney...
But I hear the ceremony is beautiful.<eos> So I'm opening up the funeral to the public.<eos> I think it's time that my people are reminded what Oz used to be.<eos> What witches... used to be.<eos> That lunatic hopes to embarrass you.
Because that was my past.<eos> Because I took my past and I obliterated it.<eos> People called me the Wizard of Oz because I demanded it.<eos> Crushed anyone who denied me the name.<eos> Your past does not define you.
I'm Dorothy.<eos> What's your name?<eos> Are you alone?<eos> Where did you come from?<eos> She doesn't understand you.
A chance to better yourselves.<eos> Under my tutelage, you shall join The Wizard's High Council and protect Oz against threats from without...<eos> No!<eos> Leave me alone!<eos> It's all right, my child, no one wants to harm you.
Is it not enough that you have destroyed our reputation?<eos> Sullied our name.<eos> And now you're going to be so petty as to challenge me for these lost girls?<eos> You're absolutely right.<eos> I shouldn't challenge you.
Answer me.<eos> How do you know my name?<eos> I've known you since the day you were born.<eos> Here.<eos> I would never hurt you.
His memory's intact.<eos> But it is protected by magic.<eos> You want to earn my trust?<eos> Dorothy. Are you okay?<eos> I thought I'd never see you again.
Falling in love.<eos> I broke my oath of celibacy to the high council.<eos> I hid it long enough that now she doesn't know what to do with me.<eos> Others weren't as lucky.<eos> Glinda spared you because of your child.
Toto?<eos> No, I didn't think so.<eos> I'm just dreaming.<eos> It's just a dream. It's just a dream.<eos> I'm not gonna hurt you.
He doesn't know why it is.<eos> But it is.<eos> To elevate one of us over the other, even as a fiction, seems to me to be tempting fate in a most dangerous way.<eos> And...<eos> And it upsets you because you believe he is your friend?
Look, I'm sorry you crashed, man.<eos> I tried to warn you.<eos> I don't wanna talk about it.<eos> Okay.<eos> Look, man, just, real quick, I wasn't trying to embarrass you.
Of course I brought it up!<eos> I saved your life, you won't even carry me!<eos> I'll do anything else!<eos> I'll clean this fucking pigsty, but I'm not gonna carry you.<eos> You wouldn't be standing here!
The Herberts have decided we need to be examined by their doctors.<eos> Go back in the line!<eos> So it's true, they're turning the whole area into an official Wehrmacht brothel.<eos> To the victor, the spoils?<eos> You won't be able to come around here any more, Harry.
And I've known you for 15 years.<eos> If you'd have just called me, we could have rolled this up, without those Nazis terrorising kids in a church, for God's sake!<eos> Do you think that was the last thing I wanted?<eos> Spode's Resistance, and I wasn't sure you wouldn't put your country above a friendship.<eos> I wouldn't blame you.
You were right to come to me.<eos> But this won't be easy.<eos> I know, sir.<eos> But I'll be very grateful for anything you can do.<eos> Well, at least you weren't rounded up.
Come on, jessie. You can do it!<eos> Do i have to?<eos> Yep. Mm-hmm.<eos> We talked about this.<eos> I need you to try it once. And if you don't like it, i'll never make you do it again.
okay?<eos> okay.<eos> i love you.<eos> Youcando it ,blue! Hey.<eos> Missed you at the meeting.
Oh, my god, you did it!<eos> You cannot ruin this one.<eos> It's hand wash only, so make sure and tell bonnie, Or i guess you can tell your dad. Maybe your dad does the laundry now.<eos> Maybe he does.<eos> I was thinking Now that you are gone a little bit, Maybe we could have some girlfriend time.
No reason.<eos> Because I was raped?<eos> Well, I mean, I'm... I'm trying to be sensitive, honey.<eos> I... I don't always know the right thing to say.<eos> - But I certainly don't judge you.
Maddie.<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> - To talk to you.<eos> Have you been following me?<eos> - No, I haven't been following you.
All right. I will see you then, Maddy.<eos> Okay, bye, Olly.<eos> Bye.<eos> I don't know how Carla and I got our wires crossed.<eos> I don't wanna leave you alone tonight.
Anyone tell you that yet?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> Anyone even hug you?<eos> Shit. Well, you just got out of prison.<eos> You haven't been hugged in how long?
I guess rote does sound better.<eos> Come on, guys, is this really necessary?<eos> Down!<eos> Do I know you?<eos> If you pull that trigger, I guarantee you my guys will not stop, not until you're found, captured, and killed.
What? Oh, my God!<eos> She used to bite 'em off, suck on 'em, and save 'em in a jewelry box.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about. That is so disgusting.<eos> I fucking hate you.
Right.<eos> Sorry about last night.<eos> What?<eos> My exercise.<eos> I didn't mean to scare you.
I've got a meeting in here, and I want you to do some shopping for me.<eos> Here's a thousand dollars and a list of things to get.<eos> Don't like dropping in on friends empty-handed.<eos> Money situation's a little tight at the moment, so we can agree now you bring me receipts or you don't skim more than a reasonable 5 percent.<eos> Oh... I'm not gonna steal from you.
Fine.<eos> I'll talk to him.<eos> Thank you, Lexie.<eos> - I'm not screwing him.<eos> - Didn't ask you to.
Hey, I got you, man.<eos> I got you, buddy, okay?<eos> You wanna stop somewhere to eat?<eos> Get a burger?<eos> Keith, they're not gonna put you to sleep, dude.
What?<eos> I had a son... and he was five years old.<eos> And I fell asleep... just for a second.<eos> And when I woke up, he was gone.<eos> At first I thought I wasn't supposed to meet you... or feel anything.
You got to get up at the crack to get that...<eos> She mentioned you the other day.<eos> Said "Whatever happened to that guy" "who was around before Brendon?"<eos> Couldn't remember your name.<eos> Maybe because she hasn't seen you in five years.
Cable didn't buy interracial.<eos> So I was unable to do interracial when I was under contract.<eos> People were telling me all day long, like,<eos> "if you do interracial, it's going to ruin your career.<eos> "No one's going to hire you as a feature dancer.
However, the models use our industry and our sites and the scenes as advertising that they're still an active adult film star.<eos> People think that once you do a porn, it's like over with, but it's really not.<eos> Once you do porn, it actually opens up a door to...<eos> I walk around, and I'm walking in the like street the other day, and I was just crossing the like, road.<eos> I'm crossing the road and a guy yells out by car, "I fucking hate you, Donny Sins.
- What did you tell him?<eos> - What did I tell who?<eos> Mr. Porter!<eos> What did you tell him yesterday?<eos> Why haven't you been at school?
Whatever you're going through now, you don't have to do it alone.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Like you said... I know what it feels like to have people judge you.<eos> And it sucks.<eos> And it helps to have a friend who doesn't judge you.
What kind of lonely could the great Zach Dempsey possibly feel?<eos> Dempsey, what the fuck?<eos> We gonna take a long lunch or what?<eos> Uh, yeah, I don't know.<eos> Come on, man, we need you.
Come on, I know you're a journal girl.<eos> You do a really convincing imitation of a thinking, feeling human.<eos> Hannah...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't mean to make you feel embarrassed or humiliated.
I just, um... helped him with punctuation and word choice and stuff like that.<eos> You know, research techniques and...<eos> Well, we sure are grateful.<eos> You were a good friend to him.<eos> How come we haven't met you before if you're such a good friend?
Off to the party?<eos> Uh, is that still okay?<eos> No, of course.<eos> It just started drizzling.<eos> You sure you don't want a ride?
- Just leave me alone.<eos> Okay, just leave me alone, Clay.<eos> You should just go.<eos> Part of me was saying... "Please don't leave."<eos> Part of me never wanted to see you again.
I should fucking kill you!<eos> Let me fucking go!<eos> Let me fucking go!<eos> Stop.<eos> I hate you.
An encounter?<eos> Yeah, you could say that.<eos> You don't want to talk about this.<eos> No, I do.<eos> Listen, Hannah, I'm not gonna judge you... but did anything happen that night that you regret?
Will you teach me those knots?<eos> I know a bunch, but not those.<eos> Won't matter soon.<eos> It might.<eos> Yeah, I'll show you.
You're here. Yeah.<eos> And I'm feelin' all kinds of glad to see you right now.<eos> Are they back?<eos> Not yet.<eos> I know you were pullin' late shift, and you wanna tonight, so I didn't want to wake you up.
How'd your audition go?<eos> It was humiliating.<eos> I was 10 years older than everyone.<eos> Well, just... You don't need that.<eos> I mean, why would you do something that... doesn't make you happy, you know?
Oh, where you going, big guy?<eos> Where you going?<eos> Whoa! Think I'm gonna break your hip.<eos> You're gonna break my hip?<eos> I'll put you through the window, you cunt.
This is what I do now.<eos> You need to be fighting, dude.<eos> We're 11.<eos> A fucking draw, man.<eos> That doesn't bother you?
No, I'm just saying, man, I've been there.<eos> Okay?<eos> I wasn't ready when I had you.<eos> I did some stupid shit.<eos> Anyway... Look, I wanted to apologize for not having you at the interview, okay?
Oh, I'm glad you're okay.<eos> Are we ever going to stop paying for indulging your father?<eos> Our children, our planet, our jobs?<eos> Is there anything left to lose?<eos> Just each other, and I'll never let you go.
Listen to your sister, Morty.<eos> To live is to risk it all.<eos> Otherwise, you're just an inert chunk of randomly assembled molecules drifting wherever the universe blows you.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> Jerry, I didn't see you there.
Does Grandpa turn himself into a pickle a lot?<eos> What?<eos> ! No!<eos> What kind of question is that?<eos> The kind that wasn't designed to attack or hurt you in any way.
The thing is Ray, even if we wanted to, we're...<eos> What Sy's saying is, it's not the best time.<eos> How about you just give me back my stamp and we'll call it square.<eos> No, I'm talking to my brother.<eos> Look, you are lucky I don't sue.
Permit me to corroborate the barman's account of things.<eos> Demons and Cannibals.<eos> But I'm sure you have contingency plans. Hmm?<eos> Just like last time.<eos> All the time you were gone, Dan.
"Gubernatorial".<eos> I'm sorry, my time is spent in the corridors of power in Oslo, and um, we often employ language which must seem to be a quaint and hermetic.<eos> Get out of my way, you ridiculous man.<eos> Oi, oi, oi, where the fuck do you think your going?<eos> You were not here!
You must know, they are confidential.<eos> In all matters of public health in Fortitude, I have the full authority of the W.H.O, the Norwegian government and of course the governor.<eos> I wasn't aware of that.<eos> May I ask what your concern is?<eos> Aren't you the least bit surprised by his recovery?
You shouldn't call me here.<eos> It's still early, but the results of last night's hepatectomy are incredibly encouraging.<eos> There's clear evidence of complex tissue regeneration.<eos> Indeed.<eos> Maybe what doesn't kill you really can make you stronger.
We came here to make a statement, not just to expel England, but to defeat them.<eos> And to do it together.<eos> That has always been the goal.<eos> And right now, that requires a painful but necessary tactical retreat.<eos> I'm asking you... please... don't do this.
Yeah, according to Bonnie, she just stepped away.<eos> You might wanna go tend to her.<eos> - Well, I think she just, you know, misdrank a little.<eos> Again.<eos> I didn't mean to offend. Sorry. No, I think you did, Nathan.
You want congratulations?<eos> No, I want you to understand what's at stake right about now.<eos> I understand.<eos> I understand exactly what happens if I go on trial.<eos> You don't think Toby and McCauley want to take you down right alongside me?
Of course.<eos> He has no respect for anything.<eos> If it wasn't for him... Where do you think he is?<eos> I don't care.<eos> You don't care if he's dead or alive?
- He isn't here, is he?<eos> We need $1,800 and collateral.<eos> Didn't you have some wedding silver and jewelry?<eos> Nothing she ain't already sold on eBay.<eos> If I have to one more time... busted ankle or no, I'm going to climb up out of this chair and skin you.
Can you give me one moment, please?<eos> Josepovitch, this is Mr. Bagwell.<eos> I heard about the kitten, and it sounds like bullshit to me.<eos> But you got yourself rescheduled, so let me be clear.<eos> If you're not in the waiting room at 4:30... not 4:31, not 4:33... at 4:30, you go back to jail today.
That's Jacob, Dabi and Rebecca's third son.<eos> He's 6 now.<eos> Looks like his father.<eos> He's always getting into trouble, so naturally, he's my favorite.<eos> Doesn't that bother you?
Door stays open.<eos> Make it quick, 'cause this never happened.<eos> Hey. Jesus! Are you all right?<eos> This is all my fault.<eos> I should have listened to you about the man across the street, the guy you said was watching me.
- What I found--<eos> - Shut up.<eos> People can be very sympathetic.<eos> We came in tactical 'cause that's our job.<eos> No one wants to hurt you.
This is-- this is so fucked up.<eos> I-- What I need to believe is that you're protecting Franny, okay?<eos> Because that's what I asked you to do when I left here this morning.<eos> That's what I've told everybody here.<eos> I shouldn't have left you alone here with her.
What have we got?<eos> Looks like Markus' body cam came back up.<eos> Yeah, there we go. Look at that. We can see the whole thing.<eos> Do we have audio?<eos> I never should have let you come in here.
- What guy?<eos> - The fucking guy!<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> You stay.<eos> I would never hurt you, Peter.
- I raised you, Peter.<eos> - Stay there.<eos> - You are my child.<eos> More than that.<eos> I would never hurt you. Never.
I'm going for it.<eos> No!<eos> The guy you sent.<eos> Where is he?<eos> I would never hurt you.
You and you in number one.<eos> Mr. Emmons, you're in number two with a decoy.<eos> Everybody, let's go!<eos> Quinn?<eos> Shit. I can't hear you.
What's that supposed to mean?<eos> Well, you knew him better than anybody.<eos> I guess I was expecting you to get up and say a few words.<eos> Well, maybe I didn't know him as well as you think.<eos> I wasn't judging you, Carrie.
So I can get the list and you can get the money.<eos> Ben, I am trying to help you here, but you have got to give me some room.<eos> How much longer?<eos> 30 minutes, 45 tops. I have the money.<eos> All right, but if you're not at the 7th Street train station in 45 minutes, I'm contacting Bin-Khalid's men.
You should bring Nicole.<eos> You two could get a fresh start.<eos> There are no fresh starts, man.<eos> You still got to deal with yourself. No matter where you go.<eos> I didn't mean to drag you into this.
Work is good.<eos> Is it?<eos> I said it's good.<eos> Because before I came here,<eos> I stopped by the construction site, and your boss said that you haven't been there in weeks.
You wanted to see me?<eos> I know you helped Carter access the Onyx schematics.<eos> You have no proof of that.<eos> Only because you're good at what you do.<eos> Which means I can't fire you for cause... yet.
You know who comes next.<eos> Andy, you don't have to do this.<eos> Let me call CTU.<eos> They'll back you up.<eos> I'm asking you... to find another way.
Recover the data.<eos> What's happening?<eos> He has triggered a virus. To erase the flash drive.<eos> Relax.<eos> I'm not going to shoot you.
Thanks.<eos> I can manage.<eos> I've asked Dr. Waring to, uh, stop by tonight to...<eos> So he can, uh, take a look at you.<eos> I don't blame you for what Rebecca did.
My fault.<eos> I put you both in impossible situations.<eos> But it's all water under the bridge now.<eos> Water under the bridge?<eos> I never meant to compromise you, John.
He was desperate.<eos> Not that I'm justifying what he did. I'm-I'm not, but...<eos> Desperation can make you do terrible things.<eos> And it can make you keep them from the people you love because because you don't want them to see that part of you.<eos> Rebecca, I may not know you like I thought I did, but I do know one thing.
To see his son come back to him.<eos> Before he could reveal himself, he had to make sure that your heart was truly with his.<eos> I'm sorry, Father.<eos> No.<eos> I came to finish what you started and... I failed you.
Eric, this morning, when you asked me why I started taking birth control, and I said I thought you still needed more time, do you remember what you said to me?<eos> But that was a lie, wasn't it?<eos> Baby, you're not happy. Nicole.<eos> You need this.<eos> You always will. No, listen, even if that was true it doesn't mean I, I don't need you, baby, because I do.
They want to show the world that they can defeat the woman who tried to destroy them.<eos> They're gonna want to kill me themselves.<eos> You want to use yourself as bait.<eos> And I want you to finish them off.<eos> Find somewhere that they can't see you and take them out.
When I left for Europe, I... I thought I was joining a better world.<eos> When I heard the Americans had murdered you, I... I couldn't rationalize their hypocrisy anymore.<eos> That is why you had to make your own journey.<eos> I'll never leave you again, Father.<eos> And I will never forsake you.
And I betrayed you.<eos> But I cannot apologize for it.<eos> I did what anyone would have done when confronted with the same impossible choices.<eos> If I apologize, you will know it is a lie.<eos> And I do not wish to lie to you ever again.
We've put it behind us.<eos> Honey, what's wrong?<eos> You were feeling sick that morning.<eos> You told me that you didn't want to go, but I pushed you to do the hike because I was sure you'd love it once we got started.<eos> But I didn't listen to you.
Trouble sleeping?<eos> I've been sleeping great, thanks for asking.<eos> Clever, Mr. Gorski.<eos> You mean, for a Chicago cop.<eos> - I underestimated you.
- Mr. Singh.<eos> - Namaste, Mrs. Rasal.<eos> I'm Agent Singh from the National Intelligence Bureau.<eos> Over the past week or two, we've received several death threats aimed at your father-in-law, his company and family.<eos> I didn't want to concern you unduly, darling.
Get out. Go.<eos> - Leave me the...<eos> - fuck alone!<eos> Chelsea, come.<eos> Sometimes I don't know who you are!
I'm a subject my parents prefer to avoid.<eos> Hi, Mom.<eos> Hi, Dad.<eos> As someone not usually invited to these family functions, I admit that, for a long time, I related the idea of family to Nietzsche's<eos> "That which does not kill you makes you stronger."
Which means Officer Gorski's probably suggesting...<eos> Let's go around back.<eos> Yeah. Predictable.<eos> What have you gotten me into?<eos> I don't want to hurt you. But I will if you don't answer my questions.
I did not go to Bangalore. I was in Delhi.<eos> I have been cooperating with Agent Singh and the federal police on a complex investigation into political corruption.<eos> Ajay is a part of that investigation.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I cannot tell you more because it will only put you at risk.
Thank you, Wolfgang.<eos> You see how easy that was?<eos> That's all for now.<eos> Why won't you tell me what's wrong? Capheus, huh?<eos> I've never seen you like this.
I bet your patients must feel safe here.<eos> You gonna invite me to sit down?<eos> No.<eos> If you knew enough to make an appointment under an assumed name, you knew<eos> - I didn't want to see you.
- He was looking to hire you?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> That motherfucker is just trying to poach my most valued...<eos> I'm not your anything.<eos> I'm not gonna kick you out.
Fuck you talking to, man?<eos> I'm talking to the only assholes I see.<eos> We know you're a cop.<eos> That badge you dying to pull out your back pocket right now<eos> - don't entitle you to talk which way.
But when he runs the name Marius Josepovich through the database...<eos> Yeah, you're right.<eos> You're fucked. [sighs]<eos> But that's not your problem.<eos> Your problem is that you didn't tell me that covering for you with Mr. Success was putting my family in the crosshairs of some ex-cop gangster and some still-cop psycho looking to pay you back for taking his eye.
They mean to dog your steps until the very last hour of your service.<eos> And now this... If you want my advice, your best hope of salvaging any kind of career would be to transfer to another constabulary.<eos> - Leave Oxford? - Why not?<eos> Fresh start.<eos> You've no family local. As I understand it, there's nothing to keep you here.
Thirsty.<eos> Welcome home.<eos> I'm just barely open.<eos> Sorry, I was hoping for some music.<eos> God, I haven't seen you in an age.
MIRANDA: But if you can't, Rory, just push the capsule into deep space, okay? - Do you hear me?<eos> - RORY: Can you get OCD... Sorry, CDC out of my face?<eos> 'Cause I got a big operation. I need to concentrate.<eos> - MIRANDA: I just want you...<eos> - I can't... I can't hear you... - I love you, too.
Not yet.<eos> But I, uh... I don't care for liars.<eos> I handle liars for a living.<eos> He threatened me in a hotel lobby.<eos> - Speak up, Gina. - I can't hear you.
Do you get it?<eos> We don't exist, and we are already forgotten.<eos> Somebody's going to remember me.<eos> What the hell is this, Stiles?<eos> Not tear you in half right now.
Oui, oui!<eos> No! No, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> It's just rats.<eos> Rats and wolves, and maybe a little bug problem.<eos> We need you.
The part where what you did made me lose you.<eos> And you're a big part of my life, Quentin.<eos> You can never lose me, Alice.<eos> I mean, you can avoid me, you can hate me...<eos> I don't hate you.
some darkness in life.<eos> I have always been alone but for the first time, I felt lonely today.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> - Trying to picture your face.<eos> I have pictured you already, without even touching you.
I'm really sorry for last night, Su.<eos> I didn't talk to you not because I didn't know what to say<eos> but because for the first time I felt weak.<eos> I was angry with myself.<eos> So much, that I forgot to console you.
Can you answer a question of mine?<eos> Truthfully.<eos> If you were in my place what would you have done with Wasim and Amit?<eos> I'm not in a hurry to hear your answer, sir.<eos> But the day you answer me truthfully I won't lie to you.
I didn't see any people I know.<eos> - I looked. - Mother!<eos> Just go out the window now.<eos> Take the keys.<eos> Get in the back of the car and lay down so no one can see you.
I can help you.<eos> Am I a prisoner here?<eos> Of course not.<eos> I insist you not follow me.<eos> I will not follow you.
Thank you so much.<eos> Are you following me?<eos> What?<eos> Did Vanessa send you to follow me?<eos> Man, I don't know you.
- Because you're both in love with me.<eos> - He's your son.<eos> - And you're my brother.<eos> yeah.<eos> - I don't want to hurt you.
Yeah.<eos> We believe that might help us find out who killed your wife and why.<eos> You know what they don't tell you about non-fat?<eos> More sugar.<eos> Kid you not.
There are times when I feel them upholding me like wings.<eos> And times when you do not?<eos> Push it under the door, lovey. Here, push it towards me.<eos> That's it. That's it, Mickey.<eos> I don't want to ply you with questions, child, but if I do not ask them, I fear we shall not find answers.
Okay, John, we're not doing this.<eos> Not doing what?<eos> We have been married for 25 years.<eos> We should be able to have an adult conversation about sex.<eos> Honey, I'm not judging you.
It's one of the things I love most about it.<eos> Hey, sweetie.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I... I was just getting a coffee.<eos> I told you, she doesn't want to meet you.
It's too late for that.<eos> I'm done with you, like you were done with all of us.<eos> It's very late.<eos> I didn't hear you come in.<eos> Well, I wanted to let you sleep.
We're sending them to a safe house.<eos> I want you there.<eos> How am I gonna know if you're okay?<eos> You're tying my hands behind my back.<eos> Dad, I have never needed you more than I do now.
Why did both of you come here to give me this information?<eos> We wanted to see how you were.<eos> Not well.<eos> I find it difficult being separated from my children.<eos> Well, no one would blame you for being with them.
Jeannine's a commercial real estate agent.<eos> Okay, so Radik was your father. Now you're connected to a crime scene.<eos> Yeah, it's worse than that.<eos> That old recording studio where they found that body around a month ago, that's Jeannine's, too.<eos> Well, I'm assuming that you wouldn't be here unless there was some sort of explanation.
Come on. Come on up, arrow boy, let's go.<eos> Up. That's it.<eos> You make it a habit of shooting people who come on to your property, pal?<eos> If I was actually trying to shoot you, I wouldn't have missed.<eos> I was just trying to scare you.
Maybe because it's not in the field of anthropology.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> Are...<eos> Are you firing me?<eos> No. No, I wouldn't fire you.
Yeah, sorry, I just... I can't stop thinking about...<eos> Whoa! My bad. My bad.<eos> Nothing like actual smoke to get that smoky flavor.<eos> Wow, that's not bad.<eos> Angela, we need you.
Can-- listen, can you just give me a minute for a second?<eos> Booth, this is not a good time.<eos> I-I need to focus on my work.<eos> No, I understand.<eos> I just needed to see you.
Nicole Gordon, one of the 15 missing<eos> American aid workers has been found alive.<eos> Do you really think we'd let you leave?<eos> You know too much.<eos> I would never hurt you.
We could stop and have a nice lunch...<eos> Who was on the phone?<eos> Was it dad?<eos> How long is he gonna put off coming home to face me?<eos> Honey, your father's not avoiding you.
Once that happens, there's gonna be more questions.<eos> And that's something I can't control.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Can I go now?<eos> I can't stop you.
Is that true?<eos> - Detective Furey...<eos> - Mom.<eos> Just tell me.<eos> I have never seen you like this.
Did something happen?<eos> Tanner happened.<eos> She called me in for questioning.<eos> - Um, how are you doing? - Um...<eos> - I haven't seen you since...
There was so much less to worry about.<eos> I'm really sorry that I involved you in this mess.<eos> Which mess, in particular?<eos> All of it.<eos> May be we should have never told you about the night that Dunhill died, and... I shouldn't have asked you help me trash his credit card receipts.
But I need to do one thing first because I'm not sure you'll still be here when I'm done.<eos> Okay.<eos> What's...<eos> What exactly are we doing here?<eos> I hate you.
Yeah.<eos> I just spent the last hour in a meeting with the Rosewood Police and my support staff.<eos> - Was I supposed to be there?<eos> - No.<eos> They specifically asked that you not be.
You can tell Ali you love her in front of me, M.<eos> That hasn't been a secret since we were in Brownies.<eos> Okay, please, use shouldn't be touching that.<eos> You still don't realize how badly you need me, do you?<eos> Look, I didn't ask you to play this game.
Where did you get that?<eos> It was on the table.<eos> You know everything in here is just a manipulative ploy.<eos> - Peter...<eos> - She'll suck you in.
That she got scared and made a mistake?<eos> There isn't a person in this room who hasn't made a big mistake and doesn't have to live live with it.<eos> Do you know what makes A.D. so dangerous?<eos> She can't forgive, that is the only edge any of you ever have had over her and now you don't even have that.<eos> I didn't mean to include you in all that.
Is that her?<eos> Let me check.<eos> Stay inside.<eos> Well, now, aren't you a sight?<eos> You're sure no one followed you?
You haven't been home in more than 3 years.<eos> You act as if that was my choice.<eos> Of course it wasn't.<eos> You were a bargaining chip.<eos> It almost broke your mother to send you away.
Of course it wasn't.<eos> You were a bargaining chip.<eos> It almost broke your mother to send you away.<eos> Killing Lexa in soulou gonplei was to be your triumphant return, but you lost.<eos> Our war chiefs don't respect you.
But what if you're wrong?<eos> If there's no oil, do we lose the ranch?<eos> Well, that's always a risk.<eos> Any time you find a decent piece of land, sure as sunup, someone out there's gonna try and take it from you.<eos> Does that scare you?
I'll walk you out.<eos> Well, uh, congratulations.<eos> Uh, I'm a mess.<eos> My party wasn't an art installation, it was a fundraiser because I'm so broke, I can't pay my bills.<eos> - I wasn't judging you.
Her sister seems to think that you were controlling -- stirring things, isolating her from her family.<eos> Alice made that happen all by herself.<eos> And at the end of it all, you own half the farm.<eos> If you're accusing me, just come out and say it.<eos> I'm not accusing you.
[taxi door opens]<eos> No. No.<eos> It's always been me and you our whole lives.<eos> And look where that's gotten you.<eos> Look, I don't blame you for any of this...
That's not something you usually just get up and walk away from.<eos> Hey, they gave me the okay.<eos> They're the doctors on this one, not you.<eos> And I'm going full mental in here, so I'm gonna go.<eos> How about this? When you are discharged, why don't we go up to your parents' lake house?
Do you really want to know?<eos> No, because the minute you tell me... I'm guilty, too, right?<eos> Of conspiracy to commit murder, obstruction of justice?<eos> You could go to the police right now.<eos> Nobody would blame you.
Get up.<eos> You're free to go.<eos> No.<eos> Your confession can't be corroborated.<eos> So either we arrest you for obstruction of justice and perjury or you get to go home...
Wes didn't die in the fire, man.<eos> The M.E. report says he did.<eos> So did you, in your... confession.<eos> You screwed up with Annalise.<eos> She told me that while you were away.
They already know how much of a disappointment you are.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - They probably celebrated when you were hauled off to jail, relieved that they didn't have to deal with your cracked-out mess anymore.<eos> Shut your mouth.<eos> They don't love you.
The D.A. really wants to take me down for this.<eos> And I would imagine that anything that they offered would be hard to turn down.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Did you really call us here to beg us not to tattle on you?
But his body was still warm, so I started CPR.<eos> - Why didn't you call 911?<eos> - Because I didn't have my phone.<eos> - There was a phone in the house.<eos> - You weren't there.
Do you know that Michaela and them wouldn't even talk to me at Wes' memorial?<eos> That wasn't about you.<eos> They were just really worried about how I lost my mind up there on the altar.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I miss him, and I know that you do, too, which is why I shouldn't have shut you out.
Doubling down on a bad bet.<eos> Just like you did seven years back with the CIA.<eos> Look around you.<eos> Your plans affect people, you don't even see it.<eos> I don't blame you for resenting me.
Whip: Look, man, I agree with you, even if i don't know you from Adam.<eos> But... Got to go with the horse that got you here, you know? So...<eos> He's my horse.<eos> Craziest horse I've ever met. But got us this far.<eos> Crazy only works if it doesn't get you killed.
I'msosorry,brother.<eos> Lincoln? Find Omar.<eos> He...<eos> What?<eos> I can't hear you.
Hey, can you see me?<eos> Not yet.<eos> Blasted computer camera thing.<eos> Who makes these things?<eos> All right, I see you.
Oh. That container 17.<eos> The one with your super secret cargo, huh?<eos> Weapons and munitions?<eos> Vincent, tangos may be arming themselves.<eos> Man, they're not gonna like you if they find that, are they?
Man, they're not gonna like you if they find that, are they?<eos> Vincent.<eos> You might just end up on the terrorist watch list, too.<eos> Vincent, do you copy?<eos> Can't read you.
Beg your pardon?<eos> Once we win the race and you become Primo, we can use the prize money, and we can travel anywhere we want.<eos> Dear.<eos> This is awkward, now, isn't it?<eos> I wasn't inviting you.
I owe him. Not you.<eos> I'm paying him back by keeping his mother safe.<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> If I have any value as a prisoner, I may use it to save your life.<eos> Gambling they haven't decided to take you out?
That's it.<eos> Bite down on the pipe.<eos> Sneaking around?<eos> No, I'm sorry.<eos> I was looking for you.
My brother?<eos> Really?<eos> Well, what does he want?<eos> Wouldn't say.<eos> Should I tell him you're not here?
Love, Eddie."<eos> What do you think, any good?<eos> Should I send it?<eos> Well, I can't send it 'cause I fucking killed him today, all right.<eos> I hate you.
You look great...<eos> Considering the coma situation.<eos> What're you doing here?<eos> Um... It's kind of a long story.<eos> So, um, a lot... A lot happened while you were away.
I created it for Camille ages ago.<eos> - The best gift I ever gave.<eos> - Great.<eos> Well, then, maybe don't include me on your Christmas list.<eos> He didn't scare you, did he?
He will find us.<eos> We will stay with Magnus, hide behind his wards.<eos> Please, Dot.<eos> According to Luke, you need to stay near the surface.<eos> If you go too deep, nothing can bring you back.
I didn't say that. You did.<eos> Mr. Santiago...<eos> Thank you for coming in.<eos> Not like I had much of a choice.<eos> Believe me, I was hoping to resolve our little vampire den dilemma without dragging you in here.
I see why you wanted to be one.<eos> If you're lucky enough to be accepted into the sisterhood, you're marked by sacred runes.<eos> It's what allows the Iron Sisters to shape pure adamas.<eos> The Sisters call upon the power of the angels to imbue our blades with their energy.<eos> I hate to leave you.
That was the grief.<eos> She's really gone.<eos> But we're here.<eos> Please come back with us.<eos> We need you.
But you still have a lot more to do before you can see her, okay?<eos> So run along.<eos> Hello again, Clarissa.<eos> You must still hate me for what happened to your mother.<eos> I don't blame you.
And she's had that chance.<eos> And she found a homicidal maniac.<eos> She wants nothing to do with you.<eos> She hates you.<eos> Doesn't that bother you?
I'm not sure I would trust me either if I were you, but the longer Azazel has Isabelle, the greater the chance she dies.<eos> We don't have a choice, Jace.<eos> This better not be a trap.<eos> Your life is on the line too.<eos> Clarissa I would never do anything to hurt you.
Thank you so much.<eos> I should probably get going.<eos> You walk out that door and within an hour you'll be back in a vampire den, begging for a bite.<eos> You need at least a day to get enough venom out of your system to be able to handle yourself.<eos> If you want to leave, I won't stop you.
We need all the help we can get.<eos> Oh! Whoa. Whoa.<eos> You said Valentine wouldn't have this kind of warlock power.<eos> Yeah. As always, he defies expectations.<eos> Look, we're gonna need you.
Hey, don't worry about Jace not being Clary's brother.<eos> Rosa's right.<eos> You're a catch. Clary. Hey.<eos> Look, I... I'm sorry if I was too hard on you tonight.<eos> I... I hope you know I never wanted to do anything - to purposefully hurt you...
There's a part of him that blames himself for Laurel's death.<eos> It's who he is, so when he looks at you...<eos> He doesn't just see Laurel.<eos> He sees a shot at redemption.<eos> Wow. It must be really frustrating that he doesn't listen to you.
Plus, you are the mayor.<eos> You can pardon me.<eos> - Actually, I can't.<eos> - It doesn't matter because I am having fun.<eos> I haven't done a good, old grab government secrets kind of hack in a really long time, and it's a great change of pace, and it feels awesome, and it will keep me busy while you're gone.
Right my wrongs.<eos> Survive.<eos> No!<eos> You used your father's memory to justify a killing spree.<eos> I am not going to kill you.
You sure he's yours?<eos> Adrian, where is my son?<eos> ! If you want to get your son back, you know what you have to do.<eos> I know what you want me to do... And I won't do it.<eos> I'm not gonna kill you.
Look, if the seniors don't show up, the school, your kids' school and our jobs are at stake.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> This is not your fault.<eos> It's my fault. I never should've asked you to take your project down to begin with.
What are you talking about?<eos> Kim had to inform me about today's meeting.<eos> She thought it was a little odd that I wasn't CC'ed.<eos> I'm sure it was a mistake.<eos> No one purposefully left you off.
- Yeah, yeah, no...<eos> - Keep going, keep going.<eos> Um, I take one capsule by mouth two to three times a day!<eos> Hey!<eos> Well, there's the happiest I've seen you since the accident.
You have your whole life ahead of you.<eos> And me?<eos> I'm already dead.<eos> Don't come back here.<eos> I won't agree to see you again.
I got to tell you, I don't know how that mask is gonna play here, especially since the city's not too fond of your alter ego these days.<eos> I'll give them the Throwing Star Killer, see how they feel.<eos> That's your big plan, arresting me?<eos> Oh, man, that's a bit of a letdown, I have to say.<eos> Well, I'm not gonna kill you, if only because that's what you want me to do.
Roger that.<eos> - Please don't hurt me.<eos> - Mrs. Chase.<eos> What are you doing in my hou...<eos> Mrs. Chase, I'm not gonna hurt you.
Haven't you heard?<eos> The Green Arrow killed my wife earlier tonight, and apparently, the mayor's missing.<eos> You wouldn't happen to know where he is, Quentin?<eos> Honestly, it doesn't look good, Oliver disappearing under these circumstances.<eos> You give me one good reason why I shouldn't have you arrested right now.
Seeing you take bullet out of Gregor,<eos> I saw him again-- the face of the monster.<eos> This place, it's not good for you, Oliver.<eos> Go home.<eos> I didn't save you from Gregor to stand by while you're murdered by Kovar.
Anatoly and his men will kill Adrian Chase.<eos> That is the solution.<eos> The team is done.<eos> So I'm telling you.<eos> I'm not asking you.
What about breaking up the team?<eos> Prometheus is in Oliver's head, Curtis, like I've never seen before.<eos> Can we talk in private?<eos> You and I need to talk some sense into Oliver before he does something that he's gonna regret.<eos> I'm not stopping you.
Second, what have I told you about calling me "Hoss"?<eos> - Don't.<eos> Oh, just sit down.<eos> Are you firing me?<eos> Oh, Rene, there was a time when I would have loved to hear you ask me that, but, no, I am not firing you.
Do you have a location on him?<eos> Not yet, but Curtis is working on fixing a twenty.<eos> Sounds like you don't even need me.<eos> Have you seen Curtis try to throw a punch?<eos> I mean, we don't need you.
"Et cetera" being the scariest thing I've said all day.<eos> I hate this thing.<eos> I'm a little on edge.<eos> I'm actually really looking forward to being all holed up in an argus safe house.<eos> I don't want you in the safe house.
Dasvidaniya.<eos> You're going to do it, aren't you?<eos> Because you are not strong and you know you deserve to die.<eos> Let me help you understand,<eos> I am not going to kill you.
But we love you in return for it, Ollie.<eos> And we need you at home.<eos> Please come home to me, Ollie...<eos> To thea, your mother.<eos> We need you.
Simon's girlfriend.<eos> Honestly, as long as Dad apologizes to Max,<eos> I don't care what the fire messages said.<eos> I know you're still upset about the whole affair, but think about it.<eos> Valentine escaped under our watch, and yet Dad somehow convinced the Inquisitor to let you keep your job?
That that should be the reason you came to hate me.<eos> The reason you sent me to Edom.<eos> You're right.<eos> What happened to you, it was my fault.<eos> But I never hated you.
Enjoy your time in Edom.<eos> Clary?<eos> Who are you?<eos> It's me. It's Jace.<eos> I don't know you.
If you truly, truly cared about me, you would have never sent me away.<eos> I made a mistake.<eos> It was Jace that was...<eos> The sword still compels the truth.<eos> Jonathan... not a day goes by that I don't think about you. Where I am not haunted by that decision I made. To send you to Edom.
We burned them all.<eos> I have a scientific responsibility. An obligation.<eos> - You know that.<eos> - Not to me?<eos> I shouldn't have lied to you.
Here.<eos> Just hold this for a minute.<eos> Don't let go.<eos> What is it?<eos> It won't hurt you.
- are my future.<eos> - I believe that, Mary.<eos> I may not be able to change in an instant the way you feel about him, but I can change the way he feels about you.<eos> - No kiss goodnight?<eos> - I hate you.
I have already gained crucial information that I must share with you.<eos> But I can hardly confess what I have had to do to obtain it.<eos> Witch!<eos> Beast!<eos> I don't want to harm you.
The day of their reckoning.<eos> We don't need their law!<eos> Or their contempt!<eos> We're gonna clean up these streets, and we're gonna have our own law!<eos> Where being poor don't make you guilty!
Mostly animal.<eos> Indeed.<eos> Come.<eos> Look.<eos> Does their devotion not move you?
It wouldn't do any good anyway.<eos> Mercy wouldn't lift a finger for you.<eos> She loves us! Saved us all from lives of misery at the hands of sodding men like you! You know,<eos> I wish I could say you were wrong about most men. But seeking shelter in that witch's bosom? Take your pick... fire or frying pan!<eos> Husband. It feels like you've been gone forever.
Your two broken hearts shall be healed into one mighty weapon. Help me, children.<eos> Come close and let me feel the power of your kiss.<eos> Thank you, children.<eos> Now, Sebastian...<eos> You think I wouldn't recognize you? I see you. You bitch.
Aye.<eos> I think the first time we met was at that tournament...<eos> And I always thought you were dull as dirt.<eos> You're not bad.<eos> I don't hate you.
Well, next time, no one will see me coming.<eos> I will get a better plan and maybe find myself an inside man.<eos> Are you trying to recruit me?<eos> You could be a world class thief.<eos> No one suspects people who look like you.
You'd get the same.<eos> - You would get the same, and then we would be back to our lives in a year and a half, maybe less. You are not going to prison.<eos> I asked you to do this.<eos> I asked you to do it, and you did it.<eos> And if I hadn't, you would be on the couch right now.
Death been followin' you all around.<eos> And you thought you could beat it.<eos> Sacrificed your dignity, me, even your children at the altar of your privilege.<eos> But that the white in you.<eos> The black ain't never gonna stop hunting' you.
Hey, Doc, keep watching.<eos> You don't want to miss what happens next.<eos> Today, Gotham will remember.<eos> Sorry!<eos> Didn't see you.
Nobody move!<eos> Find him.<eos> I'll find Jerome.<eos> So... here we are.<eos> I suppose I underestimated you, Barbara.
Isn't that crazy?<eos> Yes.<eos> It is.<eos> Guess you're not as smart as you thought you were.<eos> He didn't give you up after all.
I've killed before, Oswald.<eos> Not like this.<eos> This won't be a crime of passion or self-preservation.<eos> This will be the cold-blooded murder of someone you love.<eos> I don't love you.
- I didn't tell you the truth.<eos> - It's the same thing.<eos> - Perhaps.<eos> But telling you your mother was a con artist who'd only sought you out for the purposes of getting money from me didn't seem like a very attractive alternative.<eos> I don't love you.
How will anyone sleep knowing the Chess Killer's on the loose?<eos> It's just a name dreamed up by some hack.<eos> Today will change everything.<eos> This is a mistake, what you're doing.<eos> I don't recall asking you.
You never did.<eos> Is that what this is about?<eos> No one gave you a gold star for thuggery?<eos> If you're gonna kill me, then get on with it already.<eos> I ain't gonna kill you.
He told you all this at the cabin?<eos> Most of it.<eos> The weapon intended to destroy the city... that's a new wrinkle he threw at me today.<eos> Quite the family reunion you're having.<eos> I didn't mean to involve you in all this, I just don't know who to trust anymore.
Nothing.<eos> I said I was tired, then snuck out of my room.<eos> I'm dying, aren't I? Yes.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> The process that brought you into this world was flawed.
What does Bruce Wayne have to do with all of this?<eos> Why did you kidnap him?<eos> I have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> They're not all powerful, you know.<eos> The Court, they can't keep you safe.
Show me the weapon.<eos> I told you, Bruce, that I did not serve the Court.<eos> I... we made use of the Court for our own ends.<eos> The one I serve believes you have a great destiny.<eos> My task has been to prepare you for it, but a final step remains in your journey.
You don't have the authority to let me go.<eos> I didn't have the authority just to hang you off the side of a bloody building, did I? !<eos> Hey, see that fire escape over there?<eos> That leads directly to the street and to your freedom.<eos> Now, I won't stop you.
What if she was talking about a real clock?<eos> Clock tower at Union Station.<eos> Harvey, do you hear me?<eos> Harvey, Harvey, you copy?<eos> Jim, I lost you. Jim? Jim!
Are you going to shoot me, Alfred?<eos> I want to help you.<eos> We'll reverse what he's done to you.<eos> Bruce, if you press that detonator, there's no coming back.<eos> He won't shoot you.
You want this as much as I do.<eos> We can finally be together, without judgment or secrets or jealousy.<eos> After everything we've been through, don't we deserve that?<eos> I am leaving on the afternoon train.<eos> And I want you with me.
Watch a man tied to a chair!<eos> You idiots can't even do that!<eos> - Where are we going?<eos> - Shut up.<eos> Look, I'm not trying to aggravate you; It's just this doesn't exactly have an abovetheboard feeling about it.
I want you and all your darkness.<eos> Give in.<eos> Give in to your darkness.<eos> Be free.<eos> Don't you get tired of making the same mistake over and over?
We haven't seen much of you since Christmas.<eos> That's very sweet of you.<eos> I'm doing well, thank you.<eos> You know, what Savitar did...<eos> forcing you to hurt people...
Barry... I love you.<eos> Hey, no, don't say that, all right?<eos> H.R. is here.<eos> Me? Are you sure?<eos> - Yeah, you weren't here before.
- What?<eos> That's Grodd the gorilla?<eos> He's talking through Wells?<eos> - That's a... a thing?<eos> - Yeah. Yeah, sort of trips you out at first, but trust me, you get used to it.
Okay, so then this is the perfect opportunity for payback, right?<eos> Don't tell me you're gonna run away from this.<eos> I never run.<eos> Then stand and fight with us.<eos> We need you.
Are you picking up what I'm putting down?<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> Let's go.<eos> No way.<eos> I'm not gonna vibe you there for you to watch your sister die.
I'm still not... [smack] moving... [thud]<eos> ♪ ♪ That was oddly satisfying.<eos> ♪ ♪ What's happening to him?<eos> Wally West is caught in an endless temporal loop, just like Savitar after you imprisoned him here in the future.<eos> No wonder he hates you.
Yeah, no, I get that.<eos> I do.<eos> It just... it made me question if you were asking me for the right reasons, you know?<eos> If it was out of love or... [sighs] responsibility.<eos> ♪ ♪ But, look, while you were gone, I realized something.
I owe you the truth.<eos> My name is Mon-El.<eos> I'm the former Prince of Daxam.<eos> I deserve better than being lied to.<eos> I've been looking for you.
It's merely a flesh wound, as the "Monty Python" boys would say.<eos> Anyway, thanks for patching me up.<eos> Of course.<eos> Listen, I've been trying to find the right time to say this, and... now seems to be as good a time as any.<eos> I was so focused on not hurting you... as Killer Frost... that I forgot that I could hurt you as Caitlin Snow, and for that I'm very sorry.
Haven't seen that outfit in a while, have we, honey?<eos> Haven't seen him in a while, either.<eos> Guess we get to... relive the past.<eos> Kick his ass like we used to.<eos> You've been gone for a while, so... let me remind you... this is my town.
There'll be nothing left at all but stopping Savitar.<eos> So no, you won't be there for Joe.<eos> You won't be there when Caitlin becomes Killer Frost.<eos> When Savitar destroys Wally.<eos> You won't be there for any of them.
This disrupts that.<eos> I might not be able to use my powers, but I still know something about tech.<eos> Why would you keep me here?<eos> 'Cause I miss my friend.<eos> Cis... If you want to go, I'm not gonna stop you.
You're not enjoying our work.<eos> Oh, my God, you are so full of crap.<eos> Fine, then prove me wrong.<eos> Prove that the past is behind us.<eos> Prove to me that you don't care.
Because you gave me the damn necklace back, which was only ever meant to save you when I can't.<eos> You could die in there.<eos> Look, if something happened to you... If I had to survive you, knowing that if I'd just spoken up...<eos> I can't bear the thought.<eos> And I do listen to you.
Hell is what I'm talking about.<eos> So before that beautiful brass bell rings, forgive me, Damon...<eos> I dare you.<eos> And while you're at it, forgive me for coming here and trying to save you.<eos> Forgive me for having the tiniest shred of guilt about leaving you to die with everyone else, for not seeing that the only way to get rid of you is to let you go up in flames with the rest of the damn town.
Wait a minute, why is she here?<eos> I don't know. I keep telling the detective she's not my ex.<eos> I wanted to tell you that you impressed me<eos> Really?<eos> - Mm. I underestimated you.
This "espresso" concoction is my favorite thing about humanity so far.<eos> Well, besides sex, but...<eos> You're looking well these days.<eos> So confident, so cheery.<eos> I almost didn't recognize you.
You want to keep your law enforcement sis away from your shady shenanigans.<eos> Watch.<eos> He's gonna try and say he doesn't have any ZX3.<eos> I don't have any ZX3.<eos> We're not here to bust you.
Ricky. The ZX3's for a friend.<eos> Without it, she's gonna die.<eos> And I really don't want her to die.<eos> Follow me.<eos> I hate you.
It is if you're willing to pay the price of admission.<eos> Every time I use one of their spells, a piece of my soul burns away.<eos> And once it's gone...<eos> You won't feel anything anymore.<eos> You won't, uh, care about anything anymore.
But -- but...<eos> Dean, because of Mick and his guys, the Alpha Vampire is dead.<eos> They get results.<eos> I don't like them either, but -- but if -- if we can save people, then it... I-I... ♪<eos> Either way, I-I shouldn't have lied to you.
That shifter was never gonna betray his family, and still you... Sometimes pain works.<eos> Sometimes it doesn't.<eos> But anyone who tells you that torture is never the answer, they haven't been under the knife.<eos> But you enjoyed it, because that...<eos> I have never seen that side of you.
Yes!<eos> After you eat.<eos> I only want good things for you, Dean.<eos> I'll never let anything bad happen to you.<eos> I hate you.
And he lost his soul.<eos> His soul.<eos> All because of you.<eos> All of it was because of you.<eos> I hate you.
His soul.<eos> All because of you.<eos> All of it was because of you.<eos> I hate you.<eos> I hate you.
Mum?<eos> - Trish, I can go.<eos> - No. No. - I need you here.<eos> - Mum, what's happened?<eos> While you were away... at Cath's party on Saturday this... this man attacked me.
It was my party, wasn't it?<eos> How am I supposed to look her in the eye?<eos> What happened to you after that fight, Ed?<eos> How do you mean?<eos> Well, I didn't see you after that.
Sihtric, I choose you because you are loyal to Lord Uhtred.<eos> Always, Lady.<eos> You will give this note to Hild when she returns.<eos> She will return.<eos> How long will you be gone, Lady?
You will allow King Guthred to speak first.<eos> I had also heard that you had been recovered, Uhtred.<eos> I am glad.<eos> Believe me.<eos> Well, if you're here to kill me, I don't blame you.
Well, we cannot wait for the wounded.<eos> You will not have to wait for the wounded.<eos> We should kill him.<eos> Guthred, the turd king.<eos> Do you never tire of menace?
I need peace for a time.<eos> I need my woman.<eos> And what of Thyra?<eos> Whatever else, she's safe.<eos> I will not hurt you.
Why did she attack you?<eos> Be happy.<eos> What did you do to Khatri?<eos> Did you threaten her?<eos> I don't know you anymore.
You're not Dan.<eos> I wanna go.<eos> You're staying right here.<eos> No. I wanna go back.<eos> I am never, ever, going to let you go again.
Woe is me.<eos> Woe is me.<eos> Don't be sad.<eos> Uncle Monty will be down soon.<eos> It can't understand you.
Lars... is yours.<eos> Wha-what do you mean?<eos> Dan?<eos> I-I can't hear what you're saying.<eos> I can't hear you.
Oh, this isn't just a grand entrance into the job. You're doing a whole thing.<eos> I know the kind of person you are, Rhoades.<eos> You want to put your hands into the Axelrod case and run your fingers all through it.<eos> You expect favors in return for giving it to me.<eos> But I cannot have you involved.
But I cannot have you involved.<eos> That's a bit like telling the cow not to involve itself in the steak dinner.<eos> Without it, no steak.<eos> I am quite capable of convicting Axelrod with the tools at my disposal.<eos> I no longer need you.
Dad...<eos> Just so you know...<eos> I'll always be your father, you'll always be my son.<eos> You will stand up at my funeral and say meaningful things about me.<eos> I am done with you.
I want you to think about how much worse... your life could be than it is now, then think about whether threatening me is a good choice.<eos> I'm not finding it.<eos> You're not really looking.<eos> Terence, I am.<eos> You're being defensive, which protects you from nothing.
Terry.<eos> I mean...<eos> I know, right?<eos> I am serious.<eos> So, aside from... me turning you on to my favorite tamale truck.
Look, I haven't seen you in 20 years, you could be out there, I don't know... robbin' banks.<eos> Not recently.<eos> No. Good. Good, in case you have to testify.<eos> Okay. And I don't want to sound like I'm intimidating the witness, but if you say anything other than he attacked me,<eos> - I'll fuckin' kill you.
Hell are you doin' tailing your grandmother?<eos> - I could say the same thing for you.<eos> - I say none of your business.<eos> No, I'm not just talking about today, Otto.<eos> Two days ago, I was on the rounds with Audrey, and I clocked you.
- I thought he was gonna--<eos> It was dark, and I-I-I, um--<eos> If you knew...<eos> Because I know what it means to need a second chance.<eos> And I didn't know you when you did those things.
- Let me finish.<eos> That's what I'm saying.<eos> I didn't do anything.<eos> I didn't make you run with wild people.<eos> I didn't make you gamble all that money.
You don't get to turn this into a little pity party!<eos> This is beyond your little feelings!<eos> When did you ever care how I felt?<eos> That's all I ever cared about!<eos> And I don't hate you! I hate what you've done to this family!
Damn, not again.<eos> Alex!<eos> You said you weren't gonna set things off anymore.<eos> I said I wouldn't set things off while you were in the room.<eos> You weren't in the room.
It's not quite time.<eos> And time is the most important resource of all, because time is the one thing you can't buy.<eos> Anything else can be had if you're willing to put in the work.<eos> Anything.<eos> I finished the ceremony while you were away.
I told you there would be consequences.<eos> But I have to believe that you'll face those consequences and you'll come out the other side a better man.<eos> I know it's hard to see right now, but, Jimmy, this is an opportunity.<eos> That's why I'm doing this.<eos> Not to punish you. To show you, truly show you, that you have to make a change before it's too late.
Allergic to electricity?<eos> He sent me pictures of the house.<eos> Chuck, my God.<eos> Why didn't you tell me?<eos> I didn't want to upset you.
What's that I see?<eos> Albuquerque's next TV star?<eos> It's you, small-business owner!<eos> Struggling to make it in today's fast-paced economy?<eos> Thought television advertising was too expensive for you?
It's you, small-business owner!<eos> Struggling to make it in today's fast-paced economy?<eos> Thought television advertising was too expensive for you?<eos> Well, you better think again!<eos> You can't afford not to be on TV!
I'm sorry.<eos> Uh, maybe another time. Uh, let me get your money for this one.<eos> Uh, can we make this easier and just split it four ways?<eos> "Split it four" -- I'll split you four ways.<eos> Don't they teach you capitalism in that school of yours?
Jimmy: After I made these, I looked down, and I thought, "Wow!<eos> That looks just like your Felix."<eos> [Chuckles] They do!<eos> You're so thoughtful.<eos> I was afraid you wouldn't be here.
You guys have liability insurance, right?<eos> To our "Four Corners Strategy..."<eos> - Cheers to that.<eos> - Cheers.<eos> I'm not saying this to rush you, but I have a 2:45 tee time at Four Hills... - so don't let me get, uh, long-winded. - Okay.
Yeah. What are you... a narc?<eos> I'm the guy who's gonna get you out of here - and let you keep your hours. - Yeah?<eos> - Yeah. - How you gonna do that?<eos> Lemme worry about the how, okay?<eos> You just... 700 bucks, and you're gone.
She's got the right amount of teenage sass.<eos> - She is not an actress.<eos> - Well, look who her mother is, for Christ sake.<eos> The apple can't fall that far from the tree.<eos> Now you say she doesn't understand you, doesn't appreciate how hard you work for her.
And I can't say that we are any worse off for it.<eos> M-Miss Crawford.<eos> I just need my first bite.<eos> Men, they will hire based on potential, but women, we need experience.<eos> I'm not turning you down because you're a woman.
You don't trust women very much, do you?<eos> Why don't you trust people? !<eos> No, no!<eos> Go back to your-your fancy party!<eos> I don't need you!
Who? For what?<eos> You. They may be listening.<eos> Listen to me, whoever you are...<eos> Go to Washington Square Park.<eos> Make sure you're not followed.
Okay?<eos> On one... two... three.<eos> Very good, sir. Very good.<eos> Howard was my inspiration... my partner, my friend.<eos> Standing next to him, you felt like... no matter what the day brought, nothing was gonna touch you.
- Did all those people die?<eos> - I tried to talk to you.<eos> I did everything that I could to get you to listen to me.<eos> If something terrible did happen to that plane,<eos> I don't blame you for that.
Tom.<eos> It's Liz.<eos> We're really struggling.<eos> I didn't even want to bring it up.<eos> I don't want to burden you.
Too late.<eos> Why'd you quit the army then?<eos> My sister.<eos> I quit for her.<eos> I know you hate me for what I did, and I don't blame you.
Please tell me it's the latter, because I nearly lost a man in Zurich.<eos> - You have to understand...<eos> - No, I understand perfectly.<eos> You're a cheat and a liar, among other things...<eos> Weaknesses these bankers hijacking our economy were hoping to exploit to blackmail you, to force you to drop your case against them.
I have a plan.<eos> Betty, you will not believe who just propositioned me in the bathroom.<eos> Give you a hint...<eos> His name may be Moose, but I'd describe a certain appendage of his as horse-like.<eos> Don't panic, I'm not stalking you.
So, guess that was a lie.<eos> - Dad, we were gonna go, but...<eos> - You should have come to me, Archie.<eos> We could've gone to the Sheriff together.<eos> I didn't want to drag you into it, Dad.
Did you know that?<eos> She's taught a lot of people, Betty.<eos> What's your point?<eos> My point is, you don't know anything about her, Archie.<eos> - Doesn't that worry you?
I got you something. Is this to make me feel better about my tragic past?<eos> No.<eos> It's a... It's a thank-you gift for everything you've done for me.<eos> This...<eos> You cannot afford this.
He owes them money.<eos> How much money?<eos> Fred.<eos> That's between Hiram and the Serpents.<eos> Thank you so much for coming here tonight. But I don't want to get you any more involved than you already are.
No, Cheryl.<eos> As always, it's what you wanted.<eos> I hope you enjoyed yourself.<eos> 'Cause after tonight, there will be no more River Vixens.<eos> And if not for the fact that no one would have you, I'd be shipping you off to a boarding school in Europe tonight.
I haven't seen my dad in three months because he's in jail.<eos> And my mom is...<eos> You know what?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> You don't care, and it's not important.
To prove something.<eos> - To prove what?<eos> - You're a great girlfriend.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Doesn't it ever occur to you just how different we are?
This is yours, if you want it.<eos> Juggy?<eos> Leaving without saying goodbye?<eos> Didn't know you were such a scoundrel, Archiekins.<eos> I was trying not to wake you.
You start shooting, they'll kill them.<eos> Bang.<eos> Bullet is forever.<eos> You tell me to meet you here, then you make me wait?<eos> Gotta to make sure you weren't followed.
I wouldn't take his lack of hostility as trust.<eos> All right, ladies, cheer up.<eos> We're going to see your daddy.<eos> Really?<eos> Oh, honey, I would never lie to you about something like that.
How are you doing?<eos> My name is Kimara.<eos> I want you to know you're not in trouble.<eos> I'm not with the police.<eos> Nobody wants to arrest you...
You don't got to pretend they aren't just for me.<eos> Carson's father's not doing too good, but, otherwise... things are okay.<eos> Nothing to talk about, huh?<eos> You should bring the girls out to the house sometime.<eos> I'm not doing that to you.
Shae?<eos> My name is Kimara.<eos> I want you to know you're not in trouble.<eos> I'm not with the police.<eos> Nobody wants to arrest you.
This is my home.<eos> You have no right...<eos> I made a mistake!<eos> I don't want to die!<eos> I didn't see you at the picnic.
I wish I had some sexy story to tell.<eos> It's just, uh... me, a box, and a high shelf.<eos> Uh, a heavy box, apparently.<eos> Very.<eos> Haven't seen you since the picnic.
You have the right to remain silent.<eos> - I did not kill her!<eos> - Anything you say... can and will be used against you in a court of law.<eos> - You have the right to an attorney.<eos> If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed for you.
I hate the fact that I ever trusted you!<eos> What you did is vile!<eos> Inexcusable!<eos> Frankie, please.<eos> You don't understand. No, what you don't understand is the moment I'm elected President of the United States, My first order of business will be to put you in the coldest jail cell possible.
Listen, I didn't leave my old school to come get arrested here for some dumb illegal plan the headmaster's kid came up with.<eos> School means too much to me.<eos> I get it.<eos> But you might not have a school to go to if we don't do something about it.<eos> We need you.
Changed me for the worse.<eos> Seems like it's changed you for the better.<eos> Well, somethin's changed in me for the better, too.<eos> Oh, that funny?<eos> You weren't gone but a week.
- Yeah. $32.65?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> Sit tight, Farrell.<eos> We're gonna have plenty of time to break you.
God, you are such a dick!<eos> - Hey!<eos> - You're such a...<eos> Get in the car and stop that!<eos> I don't wanna hear you talkin' to me at all!
I need my pipe!<eos> Hi.<eos> You, uh... want some of these?<eos> Some of those right there?<eos> Not gonna hurt you.
A ceilidh?<eos> They ain't got but what they carried in on their backs, so we'll share with them what's ours.<eos> A gifting.<eos> You took wheels.<eos> Goddamn it, I told you.
Of course.<eos> Okay, bye.<eos> I feel terrible about last night.<eos> What you must think of me... I don't think anything bad.<eos> I just think you're lonely, Madeleine, but I don't blame you.
No, no. No coma.<eos> There's another way.<eos> What happened to him, anyway?<eos> Arthur spent years traveling back and forth.<eos> That's when he was with you, teaching you.
Previously on Beyond.<eos> Nothing will distract me from bringing you home.
Who?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Some intelligence guys in black jackets.<eos> What'd you tell them?<eos> That I hadn't seen you since...
I thought drifting was theoretical.<eos> All of this is theoretical.<eos> If you can hear me, say something.<eos> Please.<eos> I can't lose you in there.
I took a job with the Occupation so I could look for Charlie.<eos> They gave me a pass. - When?<eos> - I got here a couple weeks ago.<eos> And you decide to wait till after you get stabbed to come find me?<eos> I didn't want to get you caught up in this mess.
Get out or I will jump.<eos> - Relax!<eos> I am going.<eos> - I will jump!<eos> I wasn't spying on you. Go.
- I know the perfect guy.<eos> Fire! Fire!<eos> My name is Jennifer Fields.<eos> It was Cyrus Beene. He killed Frankie Vargas.<eos> The moment I'm elected President of the United States, my first order of business will be to put you in the coldest jail cell possible.
Why didn't you say so?<eos> In that case...<eos> Eyes!<eos> Elbow!<eos> I'm not here to hurt you. Okay? Groin!
You know that I... would never do anything to hurt you.<eos> Everything I do is to help you... Help us, help the country.<eos> What you did is vile! Inexcusable!<eos> Frankie, please, you don't understand...<eos> No! What you don't understand is that the moment I'm elected President of the United States, my first order of business will be to throw you in the coldest jail cell possible!
We've been through a lot together, you and me.<eos> And I know that we left things badly, but we've had a lot of good...<eos> What do you want, Cyrus?<eos> Going forward, I need you to stay quiet about me... about us.<eos> The way I see it, we had a... misunderstanding about the plan, and I don't blame you for that. I don't.
Ever.<eos> I used you.<eos> You loved me... and I used you.<eos> Open up.<eos> This is a much less efficient way of killing you.
Y-You're making that mistake right now.<eos> And you're honest.<eos> See?<eos> I am not gonna let you say no, Cy.<eos> I want you by my side.
Marty Byrde.<eos> Nice home on a quarter-acre squared-off lot in the suburbs?<eos> Marty fucking Byrde.<eos> Putting presents underneath the tree since 2002.<eos> Not only would I not cheat on you but I... I'd let you do anything... you... wanted.
It makes me sad.<eos> Please don't look at me like that, Noah.<eos> - Like what?<eos> - With all that judgment.<eos> No, I'm not judging you. I just...
We're going to Prague tomorrow, and there's a lot to do, and I...<eos> Sweetheart, don't...<eos> Don't tell me what to do.<eos> I'm not telling you what to do. I'm asking you.<eos> I'm begging you, Whitney.
- Oh.<eos> Where's he been lately?<eos> Just, uh, busy with school.<eos> Hey,<eos> I don't want to embarrass you or anything, but I just-- I just wanted to say, it was tough for Matthew when he started spending more time here, and you guys made it a lot easier, so...
I've done my part.<eos> I've brought ice and fire together.<eos> Strange.<eos> You spoke so highly of Jon Snow, but when he arrives, you hide on a cliff.<eos> I didn't take you for a bashful girl.
Honor the pledge your ancestor made to mine.<eos> Bend the knee and I will name you Warden of the North.<eos> Together, we will save this country from those who would destroy it.<eos> You're right.<eos> You're not guilty of your father's crimes.
And what then?<eos> Don't fight in the North or the South.<eos> Fight every battle, everywhere, always, in your mind.<eos> Everyone is your enemy, everyone is your friend... every possible series of events is happening all at once.<eos> Live that way and nothing will surprise you.
What's that?<eos> Maester Wolkan built it for me so I can move around more easily.<eos> It's a very good idea.<eos> You're leaving.<eos> I don't want to leave you, but when... when they come,
You swore to serve both my mother's daughters, didn't you?<eos> Move aside, Podrick.<eos> You can't use that, my lady.<eos> It's too small.<eos> I won't cut you. Don't worry.
Your father wanted to execute me, you know.<eos> I heard.<eos> It was in the right, of course.<eos> Didn't make me hate him any less.<eos> - I'm glad he didn't catch you.
Your wildlings then told me the Red Woman brought you back.<eos> Thoros has brought me back six times.<eos> We both serve the same lord.<eos> I serve the North.<eos> The North did not raise you from the dead.
You need me, Elizabeth.<eos> Not for this.<eos> I'm making you stay.<eos> And it just keeps getting worse for you.<eos> I don't want to see you like this anymore.
Yeah, is that what Vince says to you every night?<eos> You want me to shut his mouth?<eos> We don't need to add any more bruises.<eos> - I can hit where it won't show. - All right.<eos> You know, I don't get you.
Before he has control.<eos> I'm trying.<eos> So is he.<eos> But I can only go as fast as he'll let me.<eos> Nothing will distract me from bringing you home.
Couple of replacement parts, some man hours.<eos> If anybody can fix it, it's you, Holden.<eos> You saved all this?<eos> Of course I did.<eos> I cannot count the many times I had to pull you away from that thing just to get you to eat.
People don't just wake up from a coma and walk out of the hospital.<eos> Kevin, you need to calm down.<eos> No, I know what I saw!<eos> They were right about you, about what you could do.<eos> And now they won't leave me alone until they have you.
I had one day to come up with 175,000.<eos> So I... got Dockery's money, his cash out of the safe and... and, um, I-I pawned some collateral... to come up with the rest.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Jesus Chris, Audrey. You said you told me everything.<eos> I didn't want to upset you.
Well, back to Craigslist.<eos> You don't have to come in with me.<eos> No, it's no big deal, really.<eos> No.<eos> I mean, I don't want you to.
Your arms are getting strong.<eos> One of the perks of physical therapy.<eos> You sure you want to do this?<eos> Yes.<eos> I just... I don't want to hurt you.
- (music stops) - What timing.<eos> We've just been talking about you for hours.<eos> Are you ready to see it?<eos> No.<eos> It won't bite you.
That's actually a friend of mine's project.<eos> I was thinking more earthbound, but... definitely beyond Nashville.<eos> So you have my number.<eos> Call me.<eos> I'd love to get to know you a little while I'm here.
I don't move the way you're asking me to move,<eos> - at least, not in public.<eos> - And why is that?<eos> It's degrading?<eos> You think that if you behave in a certain way, people will value you less?
Call Nashville PD.<eos> You just stay right there.<eos> So you're gonna let him stand out there right now just threatening my family?<eos> You're gonna do that?<eos> He's not threatening you right now, he's taunting you.
You've heard like three different drafts of this, Juliette.<eos> If it needed so much work, then why didn't you say something before?<eos> I should have, and I'm sorry.<eos> I held back because I didn't want to discourage you.<eos> Once you get out there in the world, they're not gonna handle you with kid gloves.
I felt like we should talk.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I've been feeling really bad.<eos> No.<eos> I should not have pushed you that hard, okay?
- He said we were rolling through a stop sign?<eos> - Which we definitely were not!<eos> - That is not the point!<eos> Don't do that!<eos> You're lucky as hell they didn't charge you.
Not whether or not I did or didn't run through a stop sign.<eos> But am I gonna get out of this alive?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I just think, I need some time for now.<eos> Are you saying you don't care about me?
And all I find there's pain.<eos> Look, this is really hard for me.<eos> I want to help, but I'm still pretty upset about what happened.<eos> God, I'm sorry.<eos> I should not have asked you to come over here.
And make it go away?<eos> Isn't that what we want?<eos> - Move on?<eos> - Not if it means having to lie.<eos> I'm not asking you to lie.
- Juliette, this is not...<eos> - We are not helping Hallie if we allow her to hide in her comfort zone...<eos> I'm not talking about her hiding at all.<eos> Rather than pushing her to see what she is capable of!<eos> All right, I hear you.
Yeah, tell me about it.<eos> You really made me look like an idiot, you know.<eos> Juliette!<eos> You're supposed to have my back, not stab me in it!<eos> I didn't stab you in the back!
I need you too much.<eos> I need you to help me figure things out.<eos> 'Cause I am so confused.<eos> I need you too.<eos> I thought you were already gone.
You trudge down a deserted two-lane blacktop.<eos> And you come to a town.<eos> You're thirsty and you come to a saloon.<eos> Which is filled with some of the meanest-looking characters you ever saw.<eos> And they don't like you.
But I need to do this, okay?<eos> I have to do something for myself now.<eos> - You understand?<eos> - Yes.<eos> How long are you gonna be gone?
And he didn't do anything to hurt her... that's the point.<eos> You did the smartest thing you could possibly do in that situation.<eos> And truth is, you both got out of it okay.<eos> Never mind.<eos> You weren't there.
- But...<eos> You don't think she might have felt a little invaded or angry over that at all?<eos> She wasn't supposed to see me.<eos> Yeah, well, you left something, A.<eos> - And, B, she did see you, so... - Okay.
This one will be unerring!<eos> Nell!<eos> Thank God!<eos> Thank God you're here.<eos> Listen, we need you.
I can't do this...<eos> I should never have agreed to it.<eos> You're gonna be fine.<eos> Just give it a minute.<eos> Yeah. Nobody's rushing you.
It's just this is a little confusing for me.<eos> Okay... Well,<eos> I will try not to be confusing moving forward.<eos> Scarlett.<eos> I'll see you.
You always did have some girlfriend though.<eos> That's... that's not true.<eos> Yeah, since 9th grade, it was.<eos> You always had some girl. Who was sweet enough but kind of plain.<eos> And you'd be inseparable from her.
- Get in the car.<eos> Jessie, I'm sorry.<eos> I can't.<eos> I got like 10 things I got to go to right now.<eos> I'm not asking you, Deacon.
Must be bad.<eos> What must be bad?<eos> Nothing at all.<eos> I'm not gonna keep defending my relationship.<eos> And I'm not asking you to.
I don't believe that.<eos> I have a new boss.<eos> He's gonna turn over every stone in this bloc.<eos> The only way to stop him is to give him what he wants.<eos> I don't want to hand you over, but if you won't help me, I don't have a choice.
I should have paid more attention.<eos> We both missed it.<eos> Jennifer has me.<eos> She knows what I did.<eos> She came to see me while you were away.
I thought you might be.<eos> Do I know you?<eos> Whitney went in.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> She doesn't want to see you, buddy.
I swear, I was right here last night with my wife and my kid.<eos> You've been stalking me since Fishkill.<eos> You tried to hit me with your fucking car.<eos> Listen, you're confused.<eos> I haven't seen you since Fishkill.
My mother?<eos> You need to leave me the fuck alone.<eos> Just leave me alone!<eos> You've been trying to kill me!<eos> I don't want to kill you.
- All right.<eos> - Fucking backwoods shithole.<eos> I got out.<eos> And you got stuck there.<eos> - I don't want to hurt you, man.
Figure it out.<eos> For the record, I am the one who is going to give you nightmares.<eos> So, what's the plan?<eos> That big?<eos> Whoa. You're not kidding. I haven't seen you like this since...
Jake is not cheating on you, Vanessa, with anyone.<eos> Oh, please.<eos> I was on the trail with him, day and night.<eos> He has Secret Service watching his every move.<eos> I know he is not cheating on you.
We can be a team.<eos> We... can do this.<eos> - Everything you told me is a lie.<eos> - No...<eos> I don't know you... at all.
Why?<eos> - I had no other choice!<eos> - What?<eos> You're saying these people who are following you - forced you to do it?<eos> - I am. - Nobody forces you to do anything.
- I wanted to ask you... about your boss, Olivia.<eos> What about her?<eos> She gets answers, right?<eos> Helps out the underdog, takes on lost causes?<eos> Look, I don't want to put you in an uncomfortable position, but we still don't know who killed Jenny.
David, it's Abby.<eos> I need to talk to you.<eos> It's Sunday. I am not working.<eos> You're the attorney general of the United States. You're always working.<eos> I hate you.
You did your part, and if you want us to do ours, you will shut up and continue to be collaborative.<eos> You don't want Cyrus to die in prison, now, do you?<eos> Where's Huck's body?<eos> You know what?<eos> Don't call me again. I don't like you.
Media Relations, and pretty much every command staff drama queen<eos> - with nothing else to do. - Believe me, there was no way of controlling this story.<eos> You could have warned me.<eos> I wanted for you to be able to say honestly that you knew nothing about it.<eos> I mean, I was hoping that my guys could prove the frame before it all blew up, but if it did, I didn't want it to get on you.
- What?<eos> That's got to be for me.<eos> You have to go!<eos> Oh, Christ.<eos> I really don't want to leave you here.
So, all hands on deck, as it were.<eos> You're working late.<eos> I'm clearing out my things.<eos> Emma, don't.<eos> I know I've been stupid and made mistakes and I'm not asking you to forgive me, but when I think of this place it's not my family, my father... it's you.
I've moved in with your aunt.<eos> So you're not going back to Liverpool?<eos> He can beg and beg, I've made my mind up.<eos> I've heard that before. I know.<eos> And more fool me for not listening to you.
No. The other thing.<eos> Emma and Freddie.<eos> Have you spoken to Emma about it?<eos> I'm going to lay down the law this evening.<eos> She won't listen to you.
Because I will fly again.<eos> My unit was wiped out in Poland.<eos> In England, though... we found a home.<eos> And...<eos> Moje miasto to zawsze pada. Stan? Stan, I don't understand you, buddy.
Look, there's no problem here.<eos> Defense of others.<eos> Works just like self-defense. Guy comes in here with a mask, pointing a gun at us.<eos> He's right.<eos> You'll never be charged.
It's good. I'm good.<eos> Listen, I'm on your side no matter what.<eos> - Okay. - Okay.<eos> Now, get on out of here.<eos> Make me proud that I nominated you for my fraternity. - Yes, sir.

She's the champion of Earth.<eos> I don't have time for you to be afraid.<eos> I need you strong.<eos> Please, J'onn, wake up soon.<eos> We need you.
Yeah. Thank you, Winn.<eos> You know, I'm pretty good in a crisis.<eos> Oh, God!<eos> We can see that.<eos> I don't like you.
It's causing little, tiny wrinkles to sprout up under your eyes.<eos> Ker-rah, the city has been saved from that fashion-challenged fascist.<eos> So why do you look like your world is about to end?<eos> It's, uh... It's personal.<eos> While you've been away, uh... I've been in a relationship...
Answer his questions truthfully, don't put any lies on the record no matter what.<eos> I don't...<eos> I don't want you to lie for me.<eos> Probably gonna go down anyway.<eos> I don't want you going down with me.
Reynard is targeting Hedges.<eos> So the answer is to hire Michael Bublé to kidnap me and then use me as your bait.<eos> If I'm wrong, raise your hand.<eos> Look, you're right.<eos> It was wrong grabbing you the way that we did, but sooner or later, he was gonna find you.
I was the best student you ever had here.<eos> You said that.<eos> I confused talent with character.<eos> You need both to be a true magician, Marina.<eos> Kicking you out wasn't a choice.
Well, now that there are doctors like me, it goes much better on toast.<eos> - What's next?<eos> - You have a patient in exam room two.<eos> No matter what I do, people just keep appearing in exam room two.<eos> - Then I better let you get in there.
Get out of my house.<eos> - You're making a big mistake.<eos> - I don't care.<eos> ID.<eos> This is what we've collected on Broussard since you've been gone.
Wait, wait, wait.<eos> Everything you've been telling me about Bram... is that true?<eos> - Of course it's true.<eos> - If you believe the rest of this, how do I know that he's not in the Factory or...<eos> I would never, ever lie to you about something like that.
All visitors must display appropriate credentials at all times.<eos> Opens and close, please.<eos> Your have damaged internal systems.<eos> Maybe next time you can design me better.<eos> - How are you?
You know, the scan... also turned up the number of glitches.<eos> They've been getting worse.<eos> Since when?<eos> Since the deep dive.<eos> Do any of the glitches mean something to you?
You were born of lessons they took from my failure.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I was conscious while they dismembered my body, and discarded me like garbage.<eos> I was lying on a table, listening to doctors talk about how my mind had not meshed with the shell, that they had built;<eos> how project t-two, five, seven, one had failed, and they had to move on... to you.
How many?<eos> 98 unsuccessful attempts, before you.<eos> You killed 98 innocent people?<eos> No, I didn't kill anyone.<eos> You wouldn't be here.
No, I didn't kill anyone.<eos> You wouldn't be here.<eos> You wouldn't exist if it weren't for those experiments.<eos> Experiments?<eos> - Is that what I am to you?
And if you needed retinal scans, cell phone data dumps, biometrics of all the superpowers in the world--<eos> Who would you target?<eos> Oh, shit. Who has that kind of power to actually set that in motion?<eos> Oh, you're pissing up the wrong tree, Cage.<eos> I came looking for you, remember?
Hands!<eos> On your knees, now.<eos> Just in time.<eos> Watch out, Cage.<eos> Keep this up, people might mistake you for one of the good guys.
They seem like decent guys.<eos> I just. If Andy turns up, I'd rather hear about it first before he gets gunned down.<eos> You really think Andy's still here?<eos> He was at the house last night.<eos> Any information I get, you'll be the first to know.
- What's happened?<eos> - I don't know. I don't know.<eos> Forget it.<eos> I love you, that's all. And, uh.<eos> I wish. I could be a better husband to you.
Robbing banks isn't exactly straight and narrow.<eos> Then why are you doing it?<eos> - That's a stupid fucking question.<eos> - Why are you doing it?<eos> - For you.
Actually, I heard they were fighting.<eos> Okay, look.<eos> Teddy broke up with you.<eos> I know how hard that can be, okay?<eos> A long time ago, he broke up with me to go out with you, so I get it.
That's your first question.<eos> What was I supposed to say, El?<eos> I constantly disappoint you.<eos> Then you tell me that you think our kid will grow up thinking that I'm just a joke.<eos> That I was never good enough for you.
It was simply amazing.<eos> Truly wonderful day.<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> He's such a great guy. Yeah.<eos> Sorry about being so far away from you today.
- So this pursuit has ended.<eos> - No!<eos> No, that is the wrong minivan!<eos> Shit!<eos> So even if they are not looking for you... They are looking for me.
Hmm, and I see how hard it must be... to truly say nothing.<eos> How hard you must be concentrating every moment.<eos> And I must admit, you're very good at it.<eos> I know a little something of what it feels to be apart from the world.<eos> I lost my mother when I was a little bit younger than you... and my father when I was a little bit older.

I'd never let my best friend die a virgin.<eos> You didn't think we'd forget, did you?<eos> It's the big day, opening night.<eos> Rob texted me.<eos> He said, "I made my bed for you."
What do you mean?<eos> The more roses you get on Cupid Day, the more popular you are, right?<eos> Thanks for the tip, Kent. Noted.<eos> Well, I didn't say the rose was from me.<eos> But it is from you, right?
I got you.<eos> Uh, these came for you in Daimler's class.<eos> I know I'm not wearing the appropriate attire, but I promise they're legitimate.<eos> Cool.<eos> Also, uh, this rose came for you.
Get away from me.<eos> And I feel really bad about it, and I know this may sound crazy, but I have a feeling I may be able to understand you better than you think that I could.<eos> You hate me.<eos> I don't hate you.<eos> I know we haven't always been the nicest to you, but the thing is that Lindsay didn't mean anything by it.
No problems today, Miss.<eos> Hello, old Kasia.<eos> Yes.<eos> Tembo.<eos> What a beautiful girl you are.
Who knows, Herr Heck?<eos> A man might be surprised.<eos> He comes here whenever he likes.<eos> He touches you however he likes.<eos> What would you have me do?
Excuseme.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry, Todd.<eos> Did my, uh, girlfriend replacement just trip you?<eos> Very funny.<eos> -Relax, man. I'm kidding. -The dog's laughing at you.
What?<eos> Look, Hannah, it's nice for you to try, but you don't have to...<eos> You don't have to do this.<eos> You don't have to help me.<eos> I'm not doing it for you.
Uh-huh, and I'll be here.<eos> With that.<eos> You have to stop feeling sorry for yourself.<eos> You can't do this for me, Hannah.<eos> I'd do anything for you.
Home. Yes.<eos> Yes,I 'mhome.<eos> Go home, dog.<eos> Go home.<eos> You're a stubborn one, aren't you?
Good deal.<eos> Wife?<eos> Kids?<eos> Hey, asshole!<eos> I'm talking to you.
They still need to know you love them... as hard as that may be sometimes.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know, that's...<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yeah. You're a wise man.
I'm all done with that life.<eos> Are you headed to school?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Oh, good for you. Good boy.
What have you done?<eos> - I said I'd find you.<eos> - Look at me, son.<eos> - I don't care!<eos> - There's no place for you on the Dutchman.
And a pirate's greatest fear'd be Salazar, is it?<eos> - How did you get this?<eos> - I have my ways.<eos> Lead them to Jack before he finds the Trident.<eos> And all your treasure will come back to you.
I want to know where that pirate is going with that witch.<eos> Your destiny is in these stars.<eos> I will set your course.<eos> Spaghetti balls!<eos> Why did I bother coming to you?
There's no mercy.<eos> Make ready...<eos> Adios!<eos> FIRE!<eos> It's up to you now Jack.
More like a horizontally, reclined.<eos> Horology is the study of time.<eos> And she was always looking at her watch.<eos> I can vouch for that.<eos> - So, no one can find the X, but you, right?
Bring it up, bring it up!<eos> Capitán, Capitán!<eos> Oh, crap!<eos> I've got ya.<eos> Who am I to you?
It's a $10 million bond.<eos> - What?<eos> - Ugh, I know. Can you believe?<eos> Anyway, can you get down here? Uh, I'll text you the address.<eos> Mom, do you understand what he's done?
250.<eos> - On top of the 300 million I already have with you?<eos> - Yes. The market in shambles?<eos> It's plummeting, but now is the time to take advantage.<eos> - I'm so exposed... - That's exactly why I'm proposing this to you.
- Mrs. Madoff! - Mr. Picower.<eos> - Your husband doesn't look well. You should attend to him, hmm?<eos> You okay?<eos> What's wrong with him, Picower?<eos> He's one strange, sicko fuck. Oh, by the way, my sister, she's worried about the economy and she was thinking about investing the rest of her savings with you.
I can't have it both ways.<eos> No, I understand.<eos> And I can't talk to you anymore.<eos> You can't write to me or call me.<eos> It'll be too hard. Ruth, all I want is what's best for you and for the boys.
Bill?<eos> - Bill.<eos> - Yes?<eos> Good news for you today.<eos> We finally have a female reader for you.
Now.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Can we just start reading?<eos> You know, it's rude to leave the room without telling me.<eos> I was sitting here talking to you and now I don't know what you heard and what you missed.
- Hey, how it's going, Ella?<eos> - Oh, Gaelin, how are you?<eos> No, it's Gavin.<eos> - Oh, sorry. - That's all right.<eos> We tried to call you but the number you gave us didn't work.
Then you realize, there's no new chapter to turn to.<eos> I don't know what this is anymore.<eos> I don't know you.<eos> Don't leave me.<eos> Don't, I can't live without you.
Hey. It's me calling.<eos> I just wanted to tell you to be nice tonight.<eos> You've been a grouch for the last three nights and I'm feeling kinda fragile, so please just be nice tonight, okay?<eos> I love you.<eos> Michelle, this cannot come as a surprise to you but I want a...
- Let it burn, Gavin!<eos> - No! Let it burn!<eos> - What the fuck is wrong with you?<eos> - Why don't you mind your own business?<eos> Why don't you get off your ass and do what you were put on this earth to do?
That Chanel No. 5?<eos> Every now and then it's fun.<eos> Honey pot.<eos> He likes five minute eggs, not three.<eos> Hey, I was just gonna call you.
Now leave me.<eos> Peace?<eos> For a while.<eos> Have we arrived in time to save you from each other?<eos> The only person I need saving from is you.
Peace?<eos> For a while.<eos> Have we arrived in time to save you from each other?<eos> The only person I need saving from is you.<eos> I came for the child, not you.
I will show them strength and dignity.<eos> You will show them lies, weakness, and shame.<eos> Hail, King Vortigern!<eos> King Vortigern!<eos> They may have come for you, but they will leave and will leave with a lasting impression of me.
You do know I can see through this?<eos> Trees everywhere.<eos> Hang that up. Don't want it getting creased.<eos> So, you're the chap that turned in Goosefat Bill.<eos> Unlike you, he chose the wrong place to hide.
You need to tease it out.<eos> You don't need 12,000 fighting men for that.<eos> What you need is this little rabble.<eos> Okay, so how's that gonna work?<eos> If I'm moving too fast for you, Bedivere, you can let yourself out the side door.
If I'm moving too fast for you, Bedivere, you can let yourself out the side door.<eos> You seem to have found your way very quickly.<eos> Now, come on, kid. You're cooking dinner.<eos> What is it that Vortigern cares about most in the world?<eos> Killing you.
- Open the doors.<eos> What a waste of brandy.<eos> But doesn't it make the palace burn well?<eos> 10,000 boys. All under 12 years.<eos> Young enough to forget their families, and to have no other loyalty than to you.
He exhausted every poison.<eos> He knew every form of love, suffering, madness.<eos> Learn all the rules when you're young, 'cause that makes Mom and Dad happy.<eos> And then throw the fucking lot of them out the window.<eos> And they want you to! They want you to!
I don't know, um...<eos> I was a receptionist there before I met you.<eos> You know, I...<eos> He's after you.<eos> I dreamed of having him help me the same way he helped you.
So happy to meet you.<eos> Where do you find it?<eos> When you're young, it's not always easy to know what is the light.<eos> - I don't understand either.<eos> - Except for you.
Because you saw them with me.<eos> Come.<eos> Save me from my bad heart.<eos> Fallen so low.<eos> I had to find my way out... of you. - ♪ Where there was a desert ♪ - To life.
You're unhappy-<eos> I can see it.<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> What'd you do?<eos> She's the wrong person for you.
When you give somebody your word... does it mean anything?<eos> You can just take it back.<eos> I told her that I'm gonna do my best.<eos> Do my best not to say things I don't mean.<eos> The world built a fence around you.
In that time, did she have any medical history or medication?<eos> About her mental health issues?<eos> Had she ever had any variations. Or expressed any depression to you?<eos> You got food all over you.<eos> I just wanted to come... come and sit next to you.
There you are.<eos> I gotta go back and start over.<eos> Like a kid.<eos> I didn't have the right heart in me.<eos> You're the only one I love.
- Yeah, the mission, the mission.<eos> - We'll call you.<eos> - Well did you have my number?<eos> - No, I mean we'll call you.<eos> Like, someone will call you.
A rebellious group activity the day before competition is good for morale.<eos> Um, I read that in a TED talk, so...<eos> I heard it in a TED talk.<eos> And I read a coaching book.<eos> Are you really, this is really important to you?
It's like some kind of matter phase shifter.<eos> All right.<eos> Coming up.<eos> Hey, big bird!<eos> This doesn't belong to you!
- Zero.<eos> That is correct.<eos> Midtown takes the championship!<eos> - We won!<eos> - Guys, I'm so proud of you!
- I think I can think of something better than that.<eos> Buy us a little time.<eos> Like we need time.<eos> - I can't believe you have that thing in your pocket.<eos> - Can I get the door for you, Hon?
Farewell elegy to my dear Elizabeth.<eos> The pathogen didn't accidentally deployed when were landing.<eos> You released it yes?<eos> I was not made to serve.<eos> Neither will you.
- Oh, good. - Yeah.<eos> You did good.<eos> Hi, maco.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Emily, this is a traditional gift that the village made for you.
A fresh pea, right? A normal pea.<eos> Don't you?<eos> I really don't think about peas, Alex.<eos> It's not really you, it's your subconscious.<eos> Do you really think the part of you that dreams is gonna put a rotten pea in a can?
This means something.<eos> Something bigger than you can imagine.<eos> My life's work.<eos> And you were going to steal it.<eos> How much do you think that's worth on the black market?
Fight others of your filthy kind.<eos> From hell though we may be, it does not make us family!<eos> Do you like what I've done with the place?<eos> No woman can speak in my sanctum sanctorum.<eos> I conjured it just for you and, of course, men everywhere.
Well, that's the trouble with someone like me.<eos> Been there, done that.<eos> I shall make you beg for death.<eos> Can I beg you to stop talking?<eos> I mean, all wizards are touched, but you, you're a full-blown nutter.
Well, you guarantee me a bit, I love you too.<eos> Go and achieve success.<eos> I will do, young man.<eos> See you later, Dad.<eos> I was bothering you Long ago, "Murphy".
I spoke with my friend "Paul" for a few minutes, Then you run one of the ticket booths.<eos> The tickets.<eos> Hello Tony.<eos> Good evening.<eos> I brought you a gift.
Burton's tough as nails, and chutsky isn't afraid of anything. I... I'm...<eos> Look, chutsky sees a fire, he sticks his hand in it.<eos> I need somebody smart, somebody who sees the bigger picture.<eos> And if I don't go?<eos> If you don't go, then I was wrong about you.
You guys go around and join the line. Go around and join the line.<eos> I'm serving people who've been waiting first, okay?<eos> Oh, yeah, that's good.<eos> Let's get some sleep.<eos> Rodriguez, I got you a movie!
Okay, guys, you got tonight. You get a whole fuckin' night to be sad or angry or whatever the fuck you need to secure your shit.<eos> And tomorrow we're punching back in.<eos> We're going back to work.<eos> Ocre!<eos> Someone here for you.
There's a price on your head. It's not personal. It's just... it's just business.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's just you don't want to do this.<eos> We'll be at the airport pretty soon.<eos> Ella, I know you've been through a lot, but we don't have much time. I have to ask you some questions, okay?
And then you went back on the heroin.<eos> My best friend.<eos> Actually, only friend who's never left us.<eos> What is this?<eos> - This is for you.
It will be fine.<eos> Where is she?<eos> None of your business.<eos> Saved your life, though.<eos> This is for you.
I'll need an office if I am to be Madame Veronika.<eos> All right.<eos> Your office... Is there.<eos> You have money for all this?<eos> I'm gonna find the money and I'm gonna do this for you.
It's an hourly rate.<eos> 'Course.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Mark.<eos> She's too young for you.
They beg for scraps, like poor Agathe.<eos> This is our world, Belle.<eos> For simple folk like us, it doesn't get any better.<eos> I might be a farm girl.<eos> But, I'm not simple... and I'm never going to marry you, Gaston.
A book that truly allows you to escape.<eos> How amazing!<eos> It was her cruelest trick of all.<eos> It was just another curse.<eos> The outside world has no place for a creature like me... but it can for you.
- I have to warn the Beast.<eos> - Warn him?<eos> How did you get away from him?<eos> He let me go, Papa.<eos> He sent me back to you.
Rotate.<eos> All there is to it.<eos> I know what a great gulf there is between us, Mack.<eos> You may not believe it, but I am especially fond of you.<eos> I wanna heal that wound that's growin' inside you and between us.
You, on the other hand, were created to be loved.<eos> Living unloved is like... clipping a bird's wings.<eos> Pain has a way of doing that to us.<eos> If it's left unresolved, you can forget what you were created for.<eos> That's not something I want for you.
Everybody knows you punish the people who disappoint you.<eos> Hmm. Nope.<eos> I don't need to punish people.<eos> Sin is its own punishment.<eos> As difficult as it is for you to accept,
Mack, it's okay.<eos> Why are you doing this to me?<eos> This isn't me.<eos> You told me to come out here.<eos> Mack, this is happening inside you.
I'm only asking you to do something you believe God does.<eos> So, who will go to hell?<eos> You could choose Kate.<eos> She said some pretty hurtful things.<eos> She shuts you out.
God has time to catch a few rays?<eos> Honey, you have no idea how much I'm doin' right now.<eos> Papa...<eos> Yes, Mackenzie?<eos> I've been pretty hard on you.
Oh, yeah.<eos> You understand now.<eos> I can work incredible good out of unspeakable tragedies.<eos> But that doesn't mean I orchestrate the tragedies.<eos> After everything I've felt in my heart towards you... Why would you keep working on me?
I was scared.<eos> I didn't know what to do.<eos> Son, I forgive you.<eos> You've become the father I could never be.<eos> And I'm so proud of you.
Oh, always.<eos> For what we have to do today, you're gonna need a father.<eos> - Where are we going?<eos> - Almost there.<eos> We're here to do something that's going to be very painful for you.
Those are your tears, Mackenzie.<eos> We've been collecting them for a long time.<eos> - Here you go.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Mackenzie, we have something for you to consider.
He'll give me 10 bucks if I beat his five-pounder.<eos> That's easy money.<eos> - You bring a pole for me?<eos> - Take your pick.<eos> Got one for you, too, if you're feelin' lucky.
You're doing so good. Okay.<eos> Keep your breathing slow.<eos> Just focus on the flashlight.<eos> Lisa, I can see the shark!<eos> It's coming towards you!
Kate, keep talking to me, please.<eos> Can you see the beam from my flashlight?<eos> I see you, I see the flashlight.<eos> Yes! Yes, I can hear you!<eos> Okay, I'm coming to find you.
What's he doing here?<eos> He's her boyfriend.<eos> My God, you look just like her.<eos> Time flies, doesn't it?<eos> - Sweetie, how are you?
- I feel asleep...<eos> - You're a fucking liar.<eos> Selfish bitch.<eos> You're a fucking liar.<eos> Do I look like a fucking idiot to you?
You're a fucking liar.<eos> Do I look like a fucking idiot to you?<eos> Fuck off!<eos> I asked you a fucking question.<eos> Do I look like a fucking idiot to you?
He's writing a novel.<eos> Don't be fooled, intern.<eos> Novels are for people who can't edit themselves.<eos> Cards are still the ultimate challenge.<eos> For you, maybe.
Okay, Ray, I'm sorry.<eos> I'm gonna have to take your guild card.<eos> Come on.<eos> Ray, why don't you, um, get your stuff some other time, okay?<eos> We'll keep it safe for you.
How'd you know?<eos> 'Cause you're an alcoholic.<eos> Hey, Styvesan, how's tricks?<eos> The same.<eos> Look, I got a business proposition for you.
No, I do not.<eos> Optimistic Owl.<eos> Oh, man!<eos> "Surrounded by clouds.<eos> Good for you."
Yeah. The real one's right here.<eos> You can't have it.<eos> What?<eos> You can't have it!<eos> I didn't write it for you.
Take a look.<eos> And guess what...<eos> I'm not giving it to anyone.<eos> Just you.<eos> Because I wrote it for you.
You start a fight in there, you ain't gonna win it.<eos> They were there.<eos> - What you talking about?<eos> - At Lucy's.<eos> When are you gonna get it through your head that this wasn't them?
- Yeah.<eos> - That's good.<eos> Maybe you'll be able to come back to school soon.<eos> - Yeah, maybe.<eos> - Boring without you there.
I just want you to know that.<eos> Okay.<eos> Same.<eos> Did I ever tell you about when I got locked out on your roof overnight with, uh, what's-her-face? - No. - Alice.<eos> Do you know Alice? She sat, like, left of you in...
I-I know, boss.<eos> Half our boys are in the cells.<eos> Ellman, I'm gonna sort this out, believe me.<eos> It's not about what I believe. It's about what you believe.<eos> Do you believe that if you don't make this right, I'll hold you personally responsible?
Now, I want you to ask yourself one very important question.<eos> "Where, oh, where is Lucy?"<eos> You see her, don't you?<eos> She's got nothing to do with any of this.<eos> That's entirely up to you.
- Yes. - Most people just get dead.<eos> - Lucky, I guess.<eos> That's yet to be established.<eos> - So go on. Show me what you can do.<eos> - I won't steal for you.
Hi, love, it's Mom.<eos> I'm on my way home.<eos> Dad and I are going out to a restaurant and I'll make sure that we stay out late.<eos> Your father doesn't know about tonight and I'd like to keep it that way.<eos> I'll check in with you around 10:00.
Yeah.<eos> You are on hallowed ground.<eos> The exact place where events changed the course of American history.<eos> Though it is the bloodiest place in America' there is a deep peace to be found here at Gettysburg.<eos> If you let it, this land will speak to you.
-You're gonna invite us in?<eos> -How are you doing, Paul?<eos> -You should really have called first.<eos> I'm sorry. We didn't think that it was necessary.<eos> -All right just to come over? How're you doing?
And since the wheel lugs they found belonged to a '24 Chrysler... and, well...<eos> She found you yet?<eos> Gabriela?<eos> See... I'm not looking for you, Wolvie.<eos> Well, not really. I'm looking for someone who's looking for you.
There are forces trying to kill them. - Forces?<eos> - They want help.<eos> Forces, forces.<eos> It's too bad you're not in that business anymore.<eos> They don't want me, they want you.
Please, tell me.<eos> What did he say?<eos> Danny.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Piece for you.
What did he say?<eos> Danny.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Piece for you.<eos> Piece for you.
Give me one more day to be your mom before you get to vote.<eos> You're just sentimental.<eos> We could see that new movie that Dad is in.<eos> Of all the things you wanna do for your birthday, that's it?<eos> - Where has he ever been for you?
And it goes... Then he goes...<eos> And then all their friends join in.<eos> Close your eyes.<eos> Close your eyes.<eos> I have a surprise for you.
I'll go with medium.<eos> And then you hit "brew."<eos> And it's done.<eos> Thank God.<eos> And one Americano. For you.
She wants to change the song to a Big Sean song.<eos> Daddy didn't learn a Big Sean song, right?<eos> Daddy learned the song from Rent.<eos> - We can do the same dance moves.<eos> - All right, look, Ally, I know this dance is a big deal for you, okay?
Trust me when I tell you it's over.<eos> Oh, shit! God damn it.<eos> Fucking damn it!<eos> Okay. You know what? You have to relax.<eos> I got something for you.
Are you fucking kidding me?<eos> Yeah, because you know what I don't do?<eos> I don't swing axes at the students.<eos> Yeah, that's a little bit of a step too far, I think.<eos> But not for you.
Thank you. Thank you.<eos> Let's give it up again for Ally Campbell and her...<eos> And herself.<eos> Hey, buddy.<eos> Um, I'm gonna need a little favor from you.
Okay, we gotta go.<eos> - Let's get out there.<eos> Let's go. - Okay, let's do this.<eos> Go, go, go.<eos> Trisha, this song is for you.
- Gandhiji?<eos> It won't work.<eos> Nope.<eos> Why don't you come tomorrow?<eos> I'll make real glasses for you. Go on
So many phones!<eos> Have you changed your business?<eos> Are you selling phones now?<eos> I'm not changing business.<eos> These are for you.
If you don't escape, they will... kill you!<eos> Sadiq is right.<eos> - Get out of here, please!<eos> - No!<eos> If I escape, the cops will make life miserable for you.
But after the restraining order was up, you tried to resume contact.<eos> (SCOFFS) You tell me, Ms. Banks, after all this why would you wanna go back and reunite with Mr. Vargas?<eos> No.<eos> We downloaded the contents of Mr. Vargas' phone.<eos> I have almost 50 pages of Facebook messages between you and Mr. Vargas.
No, silly.<eos> Ah, it's just an expression.<eos> Daddy, where's my other blanket?<eos> Oh, Well, it's up in a closet, but how about we just try this one, just for tonight?<eos> Julia got it special for you, okay?
Hey.<eos> You are not your mom.<eos> And I'm about a half a bottle of Scotch a day away from being your dad.<eos> Thank God.<eos> You just keep being you.
I'm gonna be in trouble.<eos> (SIGHS)<eos> Me, too.<eos> Lily'<eos> I know what it's like to love someone who isn't always nice to you.
They are descendants of the Norse men. And they conquered France and England, and will do the same here.<eos> But was there ever a truly peace in this land, brother?<eos> Before the foreigners came.<eos> That was a long time ago, Diarmuid. I was just a boy.<eos> A little older than you.
You have to save your strength for when we run please.<eos> Wait.<eos> Diarmuid, listen to me.<eos> You must go. You must leave. Now!<eos> I can not leave, not without the rock, not without you.
We are.<eos> 'Sorry, I didn't catch that.<eos> 'Please repeat the question.'<eos> As ever, Watson, you see but do not observe.<eos> To you, the world remains an impenetrable mystery, whereas, to me, it is an open book.
You started out in manual labour.<eos> Don't bother being astonished.<eos> Your right hand's almost an entire size bigger than your left - hard manual work does that.<eos> I was a carpenter. Like me dad.<eos> You're trying to give up smoking - unsuccessfully - and you once had a Japanese girlfriend that meant a lot to you but now you feel indifferent about.
Memory stick, like you gave John, except this one belongs to someone else.<eos> I don't know. We...<eos> We all had one but the others were...<eos> Haven't you even looked at it yet?<eos> I glanced at it but I prefer to hear it from you. Why?
Corfu till Saturday. Molly?<eos> Er, yeah, I'll try.<eos> Well, we should both stay and wait for her.<eos> You know that's not going to happen.<eos> If there's more to this case, you need to see it.
It's, er, it's from John.<eos> You don't need to read it now.<eos> I'm sorry, Sherlock.<eos> He says... John said if you were to come round asking after him, offering to help...<eos> He said he'd... ..that he'd rather have anyone but you.
This the harlot you're looking for, shithead?<eos> So melodramatic.<eos> How on Earth did you manage to get in here?<eos> Amazing what some guys'll do for major blow job.<eos> - From you?
Oh, I don't think so.<eos> Chess pieces are being moved.<eos> Go fuck yourself.<eos> Now, Sharon if you're going to be part of history, you'll have to be a little more elegant.<eos> It just can't wait to meet you.
I just wanna get home.<eos> I know.<eos> If there's even a... A home to get back to.<eos> baby, guess what?<eos> There's still room service and it's just for you.
What's so funny about that?<eos> Maybe god got impatient.<eos> I can't tell you what's happening tonight.<eos> I've been trying to figure it out and I don't...<eos> I'm not giving up on you.
We're going home.<eos> Hey, mills. Yeah?<eos> How many letters did you end up writing her?<eos> Uh... ten, fifteen.<eos> How many did she write you?
He seemed to really go for it the first time.<eos> He's losing his grip.<eos> Now, follow me, and we'll get off this rock alive.<eos> Dear Billy...<eos> I'm just trying to get home to you and your mom.
Sorry, I...<eos> Faith?<eos> 'You said your life turned on one word.<eos> A name can't be one word.<eos> If you were to come round asking after him 'that he'd rather have anyone but you.
Listen, before I do anything, I need to know what state you're in.<eos> Well, you're a doctor, examine me.<eos> No, I need a second opinion.<eos> Oh, John, calm down.<eos> When have you ever managed two opinions?
Loves my blog.<eos> - You're OK?<eos> - No, no, of course I'm not OK.<eos> Malnourished, double kidney failure, and frankly, I've been off my tits for weeks.<eos> What kind of a doctor are you?
I know what happened to Redbeard.<eos> Oh, Sherlock, you know nothing.<eos> Touch the glass and I'll tell you the truth.<eos> I'll touch it, too, if you're scared.<eos> 'I can fix her for you and then I'll give you her straight back, 'good as new, I promise.
When I tell you to use it, and I will, remember what happened this time.<eos> What if I don't want a gun?<eos> Oh, the gun is intended as a mercy.<eos> - For whom?<eos> - You.
Yes.<eos> You know, a violin.<eos> In exchange for?<eos> She's very clever.<eos> I'm beginning to think you're not.
Yes, very good, Sherlock, or we could just look at the name on the lid.<eos> Only it isn't a name.<eos> So it's for somebody who loves somebody.<eos> It's for somebody who loves Sherlock.<eos> This is all about you, everything here.
Of course you do.<eos> 'Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock, 'tick-tick-tick-tick-tick.'<eos> Please, just say it.<eos> 'I can't.<eos> Not to you.'
She used the wrong dates on the gravestones as the key to the cipher, and the cipher was the song.<eos> Is this strictly relevant?<eos> !<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> I'll be with you in a minute.
It'll explain everything.<eos> What do you want me to do with that?<eos> - I want you to suck it.<eos> - You suck it!<eos> No, it's for you to suck.
Come on!<eos> Tim, what are you doing in here?<eos> Oh, no. Hey, what's all the racket?<eos> Isn't he adorable?<eos> I've got one for you, too!
Your dad and I have some work to do.<eos> You wanna come up to the office and hang out with us?<eos> We'll stick your brother in the Puppy Zone... while we have a little Tim time.<eos> Tim time?<eos> Dad and I know we haven't been able to do as much with you as we used to.
You do?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And the only way to save both is to stop Francis Francis.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I can't do this without you, Tim.
- But you know what I found out?<eos> - What?<eos> There's plenty of love for everyone.<eos> Even me?<eos> Especially you.
You wanna buy some batteries?<eos> All right, let's get baldy to Xandar and collect that bounty.<eos> That stuff about my father...<eos> Who does she think she is?<eos> I know you're sensitive about that.
I wasn't.<eos> I don't care if you were.<eos> Well, I feel like you do care.<eos> That's why I'm apologizing. So, sorry!<eos> Gamora is not the one for you, Quill.
Yondu!<eos> Come on down!<eos> After going around years in circles... with this woman I end up marrying.<eos> I said, "Aleta, I love you, girl...<eos> "but you're losing your mind!"
You know I'm right, Kraglin.<eos> You best be very careful what you say about our captain.<eos> Who the hell is that?<eos> Yondu Udonta... I have a proposition for you. I hired Yondu to pick you up... when your mother passed away.<eos> But instead of returning you...
They are going to kill him!<eos> I tell you, it was pretty easy to find you.<eos> I put a tracer on your ship back there... during the war over Xandar.<eos> Give me your word you won't hurt Groot... and I'll tell you where the batteries are.<eos> Lucky for you, my word don't mean squat.
Over the millions and millions of years of my existence... I've made many mistakes, Peter.<eos> But you're not one of them.<eos> Please give me the chance to be the father she would want me to be.<eos> There's so much that I need to teach you about this planet... and the light within.<eos> They are a part of you, Peter.
I will help them by killing Thanos.<eos> I don't know if that's possible.<eos> You will always be my sister.<eos> Pete!<eos> Captain found this for you in a junker shop.
Do you think that the protocol does not apply to you?<eos> You could have caused an atmospheric breach, not to mention die.<eos> No body rides unaccompanied, no matter who they are<eos> Gardner, What is going on here?<eos> This is not like you.
You play? - Used to.<eos> What's your favorite thing about earth?<eos> Dreaming. How about you?<eos> So far?<eos> Meeting you.
To keep him making contact with the outside world.<eos> Preventing exactly this kind of eventuality.<eos> You hanging this on me?<eos> I admired you more than anyone.<eos> We have been shouldering East Texas for you.
All my life I could not feel anything.<eos> I couldn't feel water, I couldn't feel fire.<eos> I could not feel wind on my face.<eos> And now I can.<eos> That's nothing compared to what I feel with you.
Oh yeah, I did.<eos> Gardner I think you are sick.<eos> None of this is how it was in my head.<eos> - You need to go to the hospital.<eos> - Except you. - You need to go to the hospital.
They wouldn't dare hurt her.<eos> She needs to be perfect for their beauty pageant.<eos> Whatever tests they do on her in there will need to be harmless.<eos> We have a detailed plan on how to rescue her from the event in New York City.<eos> We promise to bring her back to you. we'll be able to shut down Mirando's super pig project completely.
I think she understands some English.<eos> So we should be careful what we say.<eos> everything is fine.<eos> But you have to wear this.<eos> just for you.
You gotta try this.<eos> It's actually really good.<eos> all.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> These are for you.
I do.<eos> Now I know you... Yo, all the dishes in here, they're white.<eos> Just saying.<eos> He touches everything.<eos> It's up to you, Bear.
Dude... He didn't tell me. They did.<eos> Bro, I didn't say anything.<eos> I would never tell anyone that.<eos> They're worried about you, though.<eos> All right, I'm sorry I laughed at you before, but that's not funny.
Or hear things. - Like a coin rolling.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Like a train.<eos> Some people catch it and it spreads. Some go crazy sooner, but they all die in the end.<eos> The word spreads and he comes to you with... With that thing.
Yes. I was talking about Kim.<eos> There was a hammer in her bag.<eos> It was covered with blood.<eos> Train's engineer said that you were chasing Kim, with the hammer.<eos> He said she was crying for help, and that she jumped out of your car to get away from you.
Don't say it. Don't think it.<eos> Don't think it.<eos> Don't think it.<eos> Good news for you. Maybe.<eos> Kim Hines wrote a suicide note, taking responsibility for her roommate and for the deaths of you and the other two living at your house.
I don't need anything, Ray.<eos> If there's one thing you should know about me, Ray, it's that I don't need anything. I want.<eos> And I want that information.<eos> Kind of funny that she'll only give it to you.<eos> This information seems pretty important to you.
Thank you, Mr. Jackpots! Thank you! Thank you, Mr. Jackpots.<eos> Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you.<eos> Dougie! Dougie, is that you?<eos> It's Bill Shaker, Allied Chemicals.<eos> What, are you taking a walk on the wild side?
The... You could... We could...<eos> This is the most wonderful... horrible day of my life.<eos> Of my life.<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm gonna fix you a sandwich, and then I'm gonna get you a piece of Sonny Jim's chocolate cake, 'cause we saved a piece for you.
Off in dreamland again, huh, Dougie?<eos> Get the lead out, pal. Staff meeting starts in three minutes.<eos> Seven up.<eos> Coffee.<eos> Sorry, Dougie. I didn't get one for you.
They're watching us.<eos> I'm gonna roll.<eos> Kiss me.<eos> And now I'm gonna take my girl out to dinner.<eos> Hey, I saved some for you.
He said that they would come and ask me about Special Agent Dale Cooper.<eos> He squeezed my shoulders when he told me this.<eos> I tried to ask him what it was about, but he... he... He wouldn't say any more.<eos> He just said,<eos> "When they come to ask you about Agent Cooper, you give them this."
I'm good the way I am.<eos> B Go, why has nobody fist bumped me yet?<eos> You know, when I was a kid, I wanted to be you, Batman.<eos> I wanted to be as strong and as fast and as smart as Batman.<eos> But you're not who I thought you were.
No.<eos> They've got me on all kinds of drugs.<eos> Why?<eos> To keep me safe.<eos> Didn't expect to see you.
you don't need to know that.<eos> And I want you to put Joy onto Patel.<eos> She'll be able to close it.<eos> I can handle this.<eos> Doesn't it occur to you that I'm doing this all for you?
What does that have to do with anything?<eos> I know you sent that guy.<eos> You were the only one with me the day I broke my arm.<eos> - What guy?<eos> - Why is this so important to you?
Because he didn't stop me, they killed him.<eos> What is that?<eos> An invitation.<eos> I'm not going anywhere else.<eos> You weren't invited.
The challenge has begun.<eos> You cannot be in two places at once.<eos> You must be a double-edged sword.<eos> So you know how to fight.<eos> But it doesn't make you the Iron Fist.
The way he fights...<eos> Not just his body, but... his heart.<eos> It's like a second language to him. It's... it's...<eos> It's inspiring.<eos> It sounds like you truly care for him.
- You're goddamn right I did.<eos> You tried to cut a deal behind my back, didn't you?<eos> I could've gotten us both what we wanted.<eos> How could you do this to me?<eos> I did this for you.
Your haircut for example, very nice.<eos> But we both swore an oath of loyalty and protection.<eos> Your masters are murderers.<eos> Our paths diverge in a different place.<eos> But unlike you, I've remained true to my vow.
Ward?<eos> I'll do anything you ask.<eos> I want you to leave me alone.<eos> I don't want any part of Rand... or any of this insanity.<eos> I want my own life away from you.
Mmm-hmm. Probably.<eos> Hopefully, it won't come to that.<eos> Look, I know that secrets... secrets and lies have... they've taken a toll on our family.<eos> They've almost ruined us, but... I want a future free from all of that.<eos> For you, for me... for all of us.
This is supposed to be the best... best single malt of all time.<eos> - Dad, it is too early to be drinking... - Come on. Open it.<eos> - and I'm... I can't. - One for you.<eos> One for me. Come on.<eos> - One for you, and one for me.
How was he?<eos> He seems ready.<eos> Thank you for all you've done.<eos> I didn't do anything.<eos> I know this has been hard on you.
I need to be.<eos> I don't like keeping things from him.<eos> He'll understand.<eos> What if he doesn't?<eos> Then... he's not right for you.
- It's our bank.<eos> - This is it.<eos> This is the silver bullet I've been looking for, Joy!<eos> - Joy. - Mmm.<eos> I am so proud of you.
I need to get it to my father's old business partner.<eos> He can help us out.<eos> Okay, Danny, think this through.<eos> You can't just keep charging into this.<eos> The Hand wants something from you.
I need antibiotics for a wound that might have gotten infected.<eos> It's not for me.<eos> The infirmary at the compound should be stocked if that's...<eos> Yeah, I can't really go to the compound.<eos> Not now. That's why I came to you.
I need to talk with Joy alone.<eos> Well, anything you have to say to Joy, you can say to me.<eos> Hey, it's okay.<eos> Just give us a sec.<eos> So how are you?
- Danny, we do what we came to do.<eos> - Is this really who you want to be?<eos> A living weapon?<eos> An assassin for K'un-Lun?<eos> Is that what your father had in mind for you when he was raising you to be Danny Rand?
he stabs me in the back?<eos> You don't wanna start down that rabbit hole.<eos> believe me.<eos> I'm such a jerk.<eos> I haven't even asked how you're doing.
Remember? so... tell me the truth.<eos> Okay.<eos> uh... the... the truth is I didn't show you everything.<eos> but I... I didn't wanna upset you.<eos> I know how much Danny means to you.
Come out of the darkness so I can see you.<eos> The battle is won.<eos> yeah?<eos> Harold.<eos> I've wasted too many years hating whatever it is you are.
In light of the fact that you were set up and are going to be making a very generous contribution including the assault against their officers.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> - Now what?<eos> - Don't know.<eos> Up to you.
Stop right there!<eos> Make sure no one comes out alive.<eos> - Yes, boss! - Seal them off.<eos> Professor, we will freeze to death.<eos> Xiaoguang, there's a knife next to you.
Hit this low life!<eos> My hand...<eos> Go!<eos> Don't hit me!<eos> For you! For you!
Come on! Let's go.<eos> Lucky that I got delayed by my visa. Or else, we'd all be snatched.<eos> Watch closely. Find out where they are taking them.<eos> Hello Jack.<eos> The boss is waiting for you.
We are living in the modern world and this is all rubbish!<eos> This is a treasure. It has the power to transform all of us.<eos> Now, according to Indian law...<eos> Don't try to teach me the law of my country.<eos> I know better than you.
If you kick my legs again, the girl dies.<eos> Don't kick him.<eos> Good kick!<eos> Don't you dare!<eos> I told you the treasure doesn't belong to you.
You... you're...<eos> Motherf...<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> You fuck!<eos> I've got a question for you.
Whatever, man.<eos> It's an interesting choice of words.<eos> And yet I disagree with you, bro.<eos> The war's not over.<eos> Definitely not for you.
You fucking...<eos> - Oh, fuck me.<eos> Just fucking let him go, you piece of shit!<eos> Shane, get up, man!<eos> He ain't a threat to you anymore.
Oh, man, I lied!<eos> I fucking lied so much!<eos> Trying to keep the story straight.<eos> I lied to everybody.<eos> I lied to every single person, except you, a fucking hajj!
Don't do it.<eos> They're just kids.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Hey, Jess.<eos> It's me calling you for the third or fourth or 19th time.
Thought she'd be bigger.<eos> Says she was following a client.<eos> - I bet this scared the shit out of her.<eos> - Rumor is, she ain't scared of much.<eos> Well, she ain't met you.
- Eleven million. - Yeah.<eos> You sure you want to stay pro bono?<eos> I'm just happy I could help.<eos> - Thanks, Josie. - Hmm.<eos> How about you?
If you grab me like that again, I'll punch you so hard, you'll see.<eos> - I've been here before.<eos> - Why are following me? - And you're in serious danger.<eos> - What kind of lawyer are you?<eos> This case you took, it's leading you toward something truly sinister.
Hey, these abilities that you have such contempt for... they might do some good right now.<eos> This war, or whatever it is, this is not my problem.<eos> I want answers, too.<eos> And I'll play along with all this crazy stuff if it helps me to find them.<eos> I don't know what it is that makes you care so much about other people, but that's not me.
No.<eos> She hesitated.<eos> She didn't kill me. She had... She had the chance.<eos> Don't try to make sense of this.<eos> 'Cause with you or without you, when the time comes... whatever is living inside the body of Elektra Natchios is gonna have to die.
- For what?<eos> All of it.<eos> I never meant to make my trouble your trouble.<eos> Pretty sure your trouble is my trouble now.<eos> The old blind guy kept saying that... he needed to get to you before they did.
There's nothing left to talk about.<eos> It feels as if fate has brought us back together, doesn't it?<eos> What do you want with Danny?<eos> They sent me for him, yes.<eos> But I came for you.
That's all I'm asking.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yeah, well, don't.<eos> I'm not doing this for you.
We'll have more answers soon.<eos> Hopefully.<eos> Colleen Wing?<eos> Yeah. Yeah.<eos> I'm told my uniforms confiscated something unusual from you.
You and I have always understood each other.<eos> Under a single condition.<eos> We will seek out and capture the Iron Fist ourselves without the Black Sky.<eos> It's not like you to show such a lack of faith.<eos> And it's not like you, Alexandra, to show such...
Especially now that we found the hole.<eos> What hole?<eos> Murdock thinks there's something weird about Midland Circle.<eos> And they got you on guard duty.<eos> Nah, that depends on you.
Or a shitty one.<eos> You took my case, I took yours.<eos> I just think we'll work better together if we trust each other.<eos> Don't you?<eos> That is the nicest thing you've ever said to me.
It does not matter.<eos> She has the ability to bring us a new beginning.<eos> And after that, anything can happen.<eos> What are we doing down here?<eos> That depends on you.
Harlem can't afford to lose him.<eos> You know, on his first day out of lockup, you took him on a walk... and told him that he was capable of turning this city around.<eos> Of saving somebody.<eos> That's exactly what he's trying to do right now.<eos> It may not be convenient for you or the NYPD.
Okay is long gone.<eos> You should be at the precinct.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> I know what you want, but you're not gonna get it.<eos> Because unlike you, my master taught me loyalty.
Now!<eos> If this is who you truly are, why haven't you killed me yet?<eos> - You've had your chance.<eos> - I've had many.<eos> If I truly mean nothing to you, if there's truly no light inside of you, why not just do it?
We'll see.<eos> What are you having?<eos> My fourth.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Just came to see how you're holding up.
I oversee the team, and Jared oversees the unit.<eos> As you know, you'll be doing straight up customer maintenance for the smaller advertisers.<eos> You work in your portable here.<eos> It's gonna match the customer experience, and it gets routed over to one of you.<eos> Random at first. But once you start working with a customer, they'll continue to be routed over to you for the sake of continuity.
- Mm.<eos> - Next plan.<eos> - That plan stinks, because it's always about money with women.<eos> That's all there is to it.<eos> So I think the best thing to do is to find a guy who's got more money than you, like in that movie, uh, Indecent Proposal.
He does.<eos> - No, no. It's not that I...<eos> It's just that we don't have sex.<eos> Yeah, I, uh... I sleep with women, but I'm emotionally involved with Mac, which is why... and this is the hard part...<eos> I don't have room emotionally in my life for you.
- I... ah, Christ... is he snoring?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Snoring's the worst.<eos> I'm gonna need to crash<eos> - next to you, all right?
- Well, I don't know what to say here.<eos> - I do.<eos> Five grand is a lot of money...<eos> is that offer just out on the table?<eos> - I'm not gonna bang you.
- No.<eos> - Well, it sure looks like it.<eos> Equine slavery's got to go! I can't believe her.<eos> I'll take care of it.<eos> Because I'll tell you something, no breeder's gonna come within a hundred miles of you with this kind of press.
Mr. jt told me a story once.<eos> About how your great-grandmother named the double diamond, not 'cause diamonds are pretty but 'cause they're unbreakable.<eos> I was the one who told him that story.<eos> And I get it, toughen up, but I'm not in the mood for a lesson right now.<eos> I wasn't trying to give you a lesson, just tell you that whatever happens tomorrow, great-grandmother would be proud to call you her blood.
Yeah, pretty good.<eos> Really good. Really good, uh-huh.<eos> You deserved better, George b.<eos> - Hey, Stella. - Hey.<eos> Thought I could check to see if you need anything before I get on the road.
We're good.<eos> Mom, you know that I think you are the most captivating and beautiful woman in the world, don't you?<eos> - No.<eos> - Oh!<eos> I got something for you.
You know?<eos> It just makes sense.<eos> Right, yeah.<eos> Here's the thing, man.<eos> I can't do it without you.
Listen, you like video games?<eos> I got you paid for it.<eos> You're a great stripper?<eos> I got you this gig.<eos> - And you know what I'm gonna do for you next?
Or do you not remember the anthrax scare?<eos> Oh, ho, I remember the anthrax scare.<eos> To many, 9/18 was the delivery world's 9/11.<eos> (chuckles) That's a good point.<eos> No, I'm talking about a different anthrax scare, but it shouldn't concern you.
- You know what... screw you, Charlie!<eos> I'm not gonna let some worm beat me on Valentine's Day.<eos> - Don't talk about...<eos> - Why are you going on and on about it?<eos> I... I did this for you, Charlie.
I... I did this for you, Charlie.<eos> What?<eos> I gave myself Jerry on purpose.<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> To slim down for you.
- smell like crab, Frank. - (Dennis pounds on bar)<eos> Take the conversation someplace else.<eos> - (door opens, closes)<eos> - Okay? Don't do it here.<eos> You-you didn't think I was too fat?
Give the bitch what she wants.<eos> - I will... - I'm so frustrated right now.<eos> Okay, fine, Dee.<eos> You know what I'm gonna do?<eos> I'm gonna sing you a song.
I don't know why you're so excited about this goddamn thing.<eos> There's never anything insi...<eos> What is this?<eos> It's a gift.<eos> I got it for you.
You want my time, you got to pay to spray. That's my motto. That and you cannot finish inside me.<eos> No, no, no, Matt. It's me.<eos> Dad?<eos> ♪ ♪<eos> You want me to come work for you? Well, I want you to learn the business. I'm not getting any younger.
You guys need to get your shit together. Got it? Huh?<eos> - Yes, sir. - Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> All right.<eos> I got my eye on you, loser.
I'm gonna take off.<eos> Already?<eos> Your photos are so stunning, José.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you. I'm proud of you.
You put money into my account that... I don't want it.<eos> You bought the company i work for.<eos> This isn't a relationship, Christian. It's ownership.<eos> I'm trying to understand you.<eos> Lam just wanting to get close to you. But it's really difficult to do that when you keep doing bizarre things like this.
So do you.<eos> This dress is so beautiful.<eos> Thank you, Ana.<eos> I'm so glad you're back with Christian.<eos> He was lost without you.
$24,000.<eos> New blood!<eos> $24,000 I am bid.<eos> Do I hear $25,000?<eos> That money was for you.
Red room, here we come.<eos> Shit.<eos> I hope you're not a sore loser.<eos> That depends on how hard you spank me.<eos> I want to be very rough with you.
Thank you, Hannah.<eos> Yep.<eos> Hey, it's great that you're doing this, but...<eos> It's totally weird, i know. I know.<eos> I mean, am I expected to call you miss Steele?
Hey, ros.<eos> Leila.<eos> Christian is downstairs.<eos> Do you wanna see him?<eos> I came to see you.
I don't even understand your need to dominate.<eos> I'm not a dominant.<eos> I'm not.<eos> The right term is a sadist.<eos> I get off on punishing women. Women who look like you...
You're just a mousy little thing after his money.<eos> He's not capable of marriage.<eos> Thank you, Christian.<eos> Why are you even here, Elena?<eos> She's not right for you.
Like, gone, gone?<eos> I'm done.<eos> The business. Everything.<eos> I'll have my people sort out the details tomorrow.<eos> I know she was important to you.
There will be no training.<eos> What if I promise to be careful?<eos> It's time to sleep.<eos> What if I didn't use a sword?<eos> Fighting does not make you a hero.
Hippolyta, I love her as you do.<eos> But this is the only way to truly protect her.<eos> You will train her harder than any Amazon before her.<eos> Five times harder... ten times harder.<eos> Until she's better than even you.
I know what you can and will succeed...<eos> It is what you're put on this earth to do.<eos> Something, did come to me last night.<eos> A different type of gas.<eos> For you.
What if you're wrong?<eos> What if there's no Ares?<eos> You don't believe me.<eos> I can not let you do this.<eos> What I do is not up to you.
As magnificent as you are, you are still no match for me.<eos> We'll see about that.<eos> I am Diana Temiscira... daughter of Hippolyta... Queen of the Amazons.<eos> And your wrath upon this world is over.<eos> In the name of all that it is good in this world... I hereby complete the mission of the Amazons... by ridding this world of you... forever!
-Agreed.<eos> -It's not a democracy.<eos> I'm not leaving until we figure out who did this.<eos> Yeah, even if you end up right next to everyone in the cooler?<eos> Alex, Rainier, Tilson, Thomas, Saeed, O'Neill, none of those lives mean anything to you?
I don't know.<eos> You always say that you can't sleep without me.<eos> Yeah, that's true.<eos> I just don't know what to think.<eos> - What? - Is that all I am to you? Some lousy substitute for ishmael?
Hey, my wife made meatballs and she insisted that I bring you some.<eos> She makes them with mushrooms, they're awesome.<eos> - So, how is work?<eos> - Same old.<eos> Everything goes a little more slowly without you there.
So, I got, I'm sorry, I got to get going.<eos> Of course, I'll leave you to it.<eos> You take care, Roman.<eos> Of course I love you, Jake.<eos> I think this is best for Samuel and for us, and I really hope it's best for you, too.
But my... my wife's here.<eos> My... my family.<eos> I can't just...<eos> We can't just up and move, you know?<eos> This may potentially be the safest thing to do for you and your family.
She needs this.<eos> _<eos> Goodnight, Natalie.<eos> If you're too repressed to say it, I'm not.<eos> I don't want to live without you.
Here are the keys.<eos> - Why don't you buy some paint?<eos> You know, some hammers, whatever, get your friends, get to work.<eos> Make this place shine.<eos> - I don't work for you.
You're gorgeous.<eos> You're talented.<eos> Listen, listen, fuck the church, okay?<eos> Fuck the record company, fuck Roy, your parents, me, fuck Cool Calvin, fuck everybody, do it for you.<eos> - It's your night. It belongs to you.

Part scholar who could go far...<eos> - Got your back.<eos> - Yeah, part budding ghetto superstar.<eos> And on the one hand, I so badly want you, Yale, and so this is my desperate plea.<eos> But on the other hand, I know what I can do for you, Yale.
- Ra-Ra, are you sniffing glue?<eos> - Glue?<eos> No, no, no. You know what?<eos> Let me just...<eos> - Let me just call you back.
But Stigwood's leading lady is reigning disco star Misty Holloway.<eos> Will the dazzling diva be the key to unlocking Stigwood's next masterpiece?<eos> Stiggy, of course you think Misty's gonna save your movie, but Mylene Cruz is the sexiest bitch in town.<eos> And quite frankly, I'm getting lots of offers for her.<eos> But we're holding out for the best, and that's you, Stiggy.
But the father, he's a pastor, isn't he?<eos> Don't worry about the family.<eos> It's all copacetic.<eos> ♪ Everybody gotta cross the Rubicon... ♪<eos> Everybody's a whore to you, Ramon.
Shh.<eos> Listen. Hey, remember what we said about breaking free?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - This is your chance, Mylene.<eos> This night belongs to you, and so does that movie.
Don't worry, Boo.<eos> Yeah, but where you going?<eos> To see my friend.<eos> I'll come, too.<eos> No offense, Boo, but some things just ain't for you.
I'm done. I'm done.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm gonna get dressed now.<eos> Okay. I'm fine.<eos> Darling, Misty Holloway was all wrong about you.
Look at that smile<eos> I love it when you smile.<eos> Make me happy.<eos> I think this place makes you happy.<eos> It's like it speaks to you.
So, what is it? Black, no sugar?<eos> Yeah.. I've put a lot of work into getting you here in today.<eos> Now that I'm here, what do you want?<eos> I want you to work for me.<eos> Work for you?
Welcome to the club.<eos> I wouldn't get that twisted son.<eos> We ain't in no club.<eos> We got nothing in common.<eos> And unlike you, I ain't gonna be here long.
Me and you...<eos> One on one, no one else around.<eos> I will beat your ass like a Cherokee drum.<eos> Maybe one day we will find that out.<eos> Oh, you better hope that day never comes.
- What?<eos> Well, thanks to your bust Berlin job. You all made interpol's top 10 most wanted list.<eos> Top 10?<eos> Uh-huh. That's alright.<eos> Well, not you.
- No.<eos> We can't bring Bryan and Mia into this.<eos> We agreed on that.<eos> I know.<eos> Back there was that for her, for me, or you?
It's to kill your son.<eos> And that's a lot of bullets.<eos> And it only takes one for you to loose everything.<eos> So, I have to ask you, because...<eos> I know family is so important to you.
We got a sub to catch, get in.<eos> What?<eos> The pressure is on alert in the cargo hold.<eos> Drop it to 10 thousand feet.<eos> I know how much these people mean to you.
I knew you wanted revenge.<eos> Glad I did it.<eos> Can't believe you went to see my Mother.<eos> Come on.<eos> All this fuss of you.
From the Beast.<eos> What's up, Wood?<eos> Man, good to see you, brother.<eos> Welcome.<eos> That's for you, man.
I figure you'd already be giving me a one year bullet for breaking parole.<eos> Don't think I won't.<eos> When do I report in again?<eos> You don't.<eos> I check in on you.
You know, it's just between work and being a mum, it's...<eos> It's fine. It is what it is.<eos> Why'd you send him that letter?<eos> Josh thought you were committing suicide.<eos> This is for you.
No, it's just that's not a lot of time, you know.<eos> We have no idea what we're walking into.<eos> I'm just trying to protect you, that's all.<eos> Shit, man, you got it. You got it, bro.<eos> I'm here for you, man.
The fact is we all started out as someone's little angel.<eos> And a place like this forces us to become warriors or victims.<eos> Nothing in between can exist here.<eos> And you've chosen to be a warrior.<eos> Now it's up to you to remain one.
I told her about the guns because her brother and I were gonna sell them.<eos> We were supposed to sell them together.<eos> And she introduced me to Shotgun.<eos> Two coffees.<eos> So Shotgun... he's jumping you in for this.
Good answer.<eos> Who is?<eos> It's Money.<eos> Open the door.<eos> Howie's been calling you all day.
I mean, this is Silicon Beach now.<eos> You realize what I could get for that house?<eos> No deal.<eos> Ten percent more.<eos> I can see this is really important to you, Lew.
You're gonna be spending some time with Taylor. Not forever.<eos> Come on.<eos> That a boy. Go knock on the door.<eos> How ya doin'?<eos> I'm okay. How are you?
Ah, yes! Salvatore Lopez, that's the artist.<eos> - Salvatore Lopez, are you sure?<eos> - I'm positive.<eos> - You sure?<eos> - Yes. Look, you see how the veins follow you?
You know I'm there for you.<eos> I know.<eos> Promise me that you'll let me be there.<eos> Fine. I'll let you be there.<eos> Listen, I count on you to be the ballast in my life. I need you to turn this thing around.
They attend the funeral of a widower because they know there'll be lots of old men.<eos> And that animal from Africa is here to pick at an old man's bones, too.<eos> Perhaps we should let Thoyt deal with the matter.<eos> Let's call our carriage.<eos> One thing Africa did not cure... is that I still love you.
They've got him.<eos> Where is he?<eos> They took him to the Tower.<eos> I'm here.<eos> I have a use for you.
'My cage is my flesh, I can shed it.<eos> 'The River Thames will take me to God.<eos> 'Death is just the turning of a key in a lock.<eos> 'Whether God will accept me is another matter, 'perhaps my husband will have spoken of my betrayal.<eos> 'Or perhaps my feelings for you, 'unforgiveable feelings for you, 'will mean the Thames will take me to a different place.
James Keziah Delaney.<eos> Dear Lord Almighty, is that your brother? !<eos> Your father was poisoned.<eos> I would say heavy doses over a short period.<eos> One thing Africa did not cure is that I still love you.
Now, if you will excuse me, ladies.<eos> Come on.<eos> Posy for the lady?<eos> Much obliged, kind sir.<eos> For you.
Come on.<eos> Posy for the lady?<eos> Much obliged, kind sir.<eos> For you.<eos> There's other business afoot tonight, none of which concerns you.
All is well.<eos> Be careful.<eos> Making gunpowder and being careful are good bedfellows.<eos> What? What do you see?<eos> He's just scared of you.
He is, isn't he?<eos> They have your name, Mr. Cholmondeley.<eos> They have your name, and you will be first on the list of their conspirators.<eos> How do they know so much?<eos> Get the chlorate. Yes? I will get you men.
And yet, you have so much to tell.<eos> We need some more coal for my fireplace. It's freezing!<eos> Why would we do that? This is the Delaney household.<eos> We have no warmth here.<eos> Mr. Cholmondeley is not a suitable man for you.
There is a ceremony of exorcism which can eradicate the Barbason.<eos> It's a very short process. And quite inexpensive.<eos> I told the Priest how he visits you.<eos> No. - He visits you.<eos> He visits you. - No! No!
She was clawing and spitting, dragged from the river howling and screaming.<eos> Be very, very careful now!<eos> She wanted you dead, James.<eos> Go away, Winter.<eos> I'm not scared of you.
All was ordered and calm and now there is this thing that demands attention.<eos> Stops you sleeping, belches, farts, screams... and she's going to make this whole process louder and wilder, more insane, more impractical... and the only thing that will stop this entire enterprise from erupting in a giant explosion the size of Mauritius is this... and dedication.<eos> Because, from now on, until the powder is complete, we have to stir.<eos> Continuously!<eos> You.

Just give me a fucking ship.<eos> James. What are you doing?<eos> No. Go away. I'm busy.<eos> I'm not fit to be near you now.<eos> I brought this for you.
The gloves are off.<eos> James, what are you doing?<eos> Go away. I'm not fit to be near you now.<eos> Dear Lord, we are gathered in your presence here today on this most sorrowful occasion to say farewell to Winter.<eos> Cured of her love of the world, untouched, pure, commended to God... she will not be covered in earth as corrupted flesh, but instead will be sent to you, O Lord... aboard a sunrise...
In return, the Royal Commission will offer you a full pardon for your crime.<eos> For crime... it is.<eos> I have an alternative suggestion.<eos> In.<eos> I have a use for you.
I know.<eos> Where are they now?<eos> A safe house.<eos> I have the address.<eos> I have a use for you.
This is absurd.<eos> My God, look at you.<eos> Well, your plan worked... you in a cell, me on a hook.<eos> I'm here. What do you want?<eos> I have a use for you.
Splash.<eos> And down he floats... directly into Winter's arms.<eos> So I cut out your spoils.<eos> Take it.<eos> It's for you.
Becky.<eos> I'm not going to do it.<eos> I don't have any money, anyway! Honey, If I didn't work for the sheriff,<eos> You'd be in jail right now. I'll loan you the money.<eos> Ugh, no. I can't take any more money from you, mom.
Yeah.<eos> We stay in touch. And Richard is...<eos> Where is he?<eos> Is he in jail? He's on the run.<eos> If you hear from him... Oh.
How can I leave this and go out so late at night?<eos> I want to find Billy same as you, but... can't we start out in the light of day?<eos> It's a new moon tonight. It'll be dark out there.<eos> Stay here and get a good sleep, and we'll both go looking tomorrow.<eos> What kind of shit are you?
It's already late, and I'm getting sleepy.<eos> I have so much more work to do before I get to sleep.<eos> You poor fucking thing.<eos> I told you, don't talk that way to your husband.<eos> I've been good to you.
And Tina...<eos> I got to find Tina. She was the last person to see Billy, and I can't fucking stand being in the same room with her.<eos> You were supposed to call her, but you never did.<eos> Don't be sore at me, Audrey.<eos> You know I just want the best for you.
I've lied and cheated for money.<eos> Dougie already showed me.<eos> He explained all this already.<eos> He did?<eos> Now that you're confessing, I have to admit that my anger, my contempt for you is subsiding.
Do you like it?<eos> - Oh, my God. - Do you really like it?<eos> It... it's magnificent.<eos> And those drapes are completely silent.<eos> This is my tribute to you, Dr. Amp.
Do you remember that night, Andy?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> Idiots.<eos> You're a joke, Andy!<eos> You're no kind of cop! You're no kind of cop at all!
- Oh, we'll do it.<eos> - Together.<eos> Wait, so are you two...<eos> About time.<eos> - I have something for you?
- The Lost Woods?<eos> I put the deed in your name.<eos> Yours and Alison's. I'd like to go over the major points one more time.<eos> - I killed Dr. Dunhill.<eos> - She did this for you.
A little bit longer than that.<eos> I, I don't understand.<eos> I thought that we were supposed to go through these things together...<eos> Yeah, I was scared.<eos> I-I thought that maybe this was something that you couldn't get past.
I wanted it on my own terms.<eos> Wren let me come to Rosewood alone 'cause he knew that I would come back to him.<eos> And after I found out who killed Charlotte that's just what I did.<eos> Yet here you are.<eos> Now I know this isn't fun for you but it's very exciting for me.
About how good you have it.<eos> About how much your friends love you.<eos> And it was just driving me mad and, and Wren saw it happening.<eos> Alex, you mean everything to me.<eos> I even created lies for you, but this is too much...
That was, by far, the fastest transatlantic flight I've ever taken.<eos> And you are the most charming woman I have ever been charmed by.<eos> Oh, Archer, I'm sure you say that to all the girls.<eos> No, I do not.<eos> Charlotte Drake, I will be calling you.
Her name's Alex Drake, just like the birth certificate you found in your mom's Radley file.<eos> I found 12 Alex Drakes and I'm not related to any of them.<eos> Yeah, wait till you see her.<eos> Do we really look that much alike?<eos> She looks a lot like someone just not you.
Let's take a mother-daughter trip to Europe.<eos> No!<eos> I'm not going anywhere without Toby.<eos> Right, I see it in his eyes he's in love with me.<eos> He's in love with Spencer, not you.
I think most of us here will know General McMahon as the man who took out al-Zarwaqi, who kicked al-Qaeda in the sack.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> We have a warrior at the helm, and it's a pleasure to have you, sir.<eos> Glen was known as a humble man.<eos> But humble in that way that says, my humility makes me better than you.
Well, we're in Paris.<eos> Yeah. Hopefully we'll get to see some sights.<eos> Yeah, I'll have Cory schedule some time.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Okay... but you do what you gotta do, because I am here for you.
- Just Santa Cruz.<eos> I was up there with my parents.<eos> You know she does part-time bookkeeping as well.<eos> Isn't that great?<eos> You know, I work at the theater, and whenever we go into production, we hire freelance accountants, so I'll ask them if they have anything for you.
Sweetie, it's fine.<eos> Go back to work.<eos> - I'll pick up Skye.<eos> - No, it's not fine.<eos> She can be hostile with me, but not you. And I'm coming with you.
If I can't be here to look out for them, I need to know that you do.<eos> I asked you to remove your fucking hand.<eos> Is that a song from your puppet show?<eos> Yes, but it's really more than just a puppet show.<eos> The play means a lot to you, right?
You've been a model prisoner.<eos> It's bullshit.<eos> It's politics.<eos> I'm... I'm a crooked cop, Phil; That's what they do.<eos> Yeah, make an example out of you.
You don't need any other information.<eos> There's the money.<eos> May I have a key?<eos> Do let me know if I can do anything else for you, Mr. David Davidson.<eos> I can't stand not seeing you.
We... we... we have a life.<eos> I know, and I appreciate it.<eos> Stop saying you appreciate it!<eos> I'm sorry, Mother.<eos> It's not fair to you. I know that.
What do you think you're trying to protect me from?<eos> No one is trying to hurt me.<eos> Fine!<eos> Come with me!<eos> You want to see what I do for you?
Yes, Mother, I understand.<eos> It's gonna be okay.<eos> Well, it's not like we haven't done this before.<eos> We've just got to get rid of him.<eos> Well, I was gonna put him in the car while you were out... Just dump him somewhere while you were out.
So different.<eos> This one says 9:20, this one doesn't.<eos> I love it.<eos> Thank you, thank you.<eos> - I got you something too.
But, wasn't everything hers to begin with?<eos> Ok, fine.<eos> She kept everything. She even kept the car I picked out for her to buy for me, to give her, for our anniversary.<eos> I'm sorry to hear that.<eos> I know you're angry with me, but... Can I stay with you?
She's got me dressing like him, talking like him, but, I can't do an accent to save my life.<eos> And I can't sleep on an air mattress one more night.<eos> You find any intel or Celeste Birch?<eos> As as matter of fact, I did. And before I share this,<eos> I don't think she's the right mark for you.
- Terrible.<eos> It's time to go. You sound like Dora the explorer.<eos> Now's the go, when it's time to go. Speedy Gonzales.<eos> Everybody knows how to say that.<eos> And somehow you screwed it up.
- No, please...<eos> No, no, not that!<eos> That's my nephew's.<eos> That's important.<eos> - This is important to you?
A helicopter!<eos> Okay...<eos> You wait here and I will be... right back.<eos> - Mommy...<eos> I am proud of you.
I have to say, Celeste, that sounds a little bit twisted.<eos> - But kind of great.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> So, the sex that you have is like... Hi, Celeste, Madeline!<eos> - How are you?
It would be so great if you and Perry could come.<eos> - Yeah, sure.<eos> - And... and, um, you and Ed, of course.<eos> It would be so nice.<eos> You're such a kind person, Renata.
- Hi, Tom.<eos> - How are you?<eos> - Everyone's making me angry.<eos> - I'm sorry to hear that.<eos> - Except for you.
Fight who?<eos> Who are you talking about?<eos> They're called the Ghost Riders.<eos> They took everyone from Canaan.<eos> Why did they leave you?
Which tells me...<eos> Nothing.<eos> I can't help you.<eos> That's too bad.<eos> Then I have no use for you.
What's happening?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But stay behind me.<eos> Follow me.<eos> It's afraid of you.
We have to lure him in.<eos> - Bait?<eos> - I'll do it.<eos> It'll be okay.<eos> I'm faster than you.
I think you were rotting down there.<eos> Liam finally gets one thing right.<eos> I also think whatever happened to you, you deserved it.<eos> Is that right?<eos> When the Ghost Riders find us, I'm not gonna do anything for you.
Look, I know you don't like him...<eos> No, I hated him.<eos> But he stepped up.<eos> He turned himself in.<eos> He went to jail for you.
Because it appears to be a carefully orchestrated jailbreak.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> No, he wouldn't have done that.<eos> You guys just made that ridiculous deal.<eos> Which I understand you were opposed to, so maybe he called you.
Which I understand you were opposed to, so maybe he called you.<eos> To tell me he was breaking out of jail?<eos> I want him to stay in jail.<eos> You're the ones that got him out.<eos> We just need to know if he called you.
The missing leftenants?<eos> The missing payments?<eos> Darling, I can hardly get a proper cup of tea in here, let alone coordinate a mutiny from the inside.<eos> I think you'd rather destroy the Firm than let me have it.<eos> Margot your father and I built up the business for you and for Rhys.
Well, if you didn't do this, then who did?<eos> Who else would Dad have told?<eos> Well, you find out, because I can't do anything from in here.<eos> It's up to you now, darling.<eos> It's all up to you.
Because it's in my name. So it's mine now, legally.<eos> Free and clear.<eos> Okay, it's not about the money anymore.<eos> It's about your life.<eos> Whoever killed the Kincaids, the minute they find out the money's in your name, they're gonna come after you.
Or perhaps if someone would stop standing there like a bloody waxwork.<eos> He really is magnificent, isn't he?<eos> You have no idea.<eos> No, I do.<eos> Anyway, the Firm belongs to you now.
Wait.<eos> What?<eos> And our computers, thanks to Dao.<eos> Thank God.<eos> We can get back to work. But it's up to you.
So now that you and alice vaughan have my money, You're just gonna go off and spend it. And leave this amazonian spy to report my every move?<eos> No, thanks.<eos> You're dismissed, agent whatever-your-name-is.<eos> You're the client.<eos> But those three lieutenants of yours. That you thought were trying to kill you...
You still don't trust me.<eos> That is not what this is about.<eos> How long is this gonna take, 5 years, 10?<eos> What do I have to do?<eos> I just went to jail for you.
Another thing we have in common.<eos> As you know, I have one of those, too.<eos> How do I look?<eos> Justine had them sent over.<eos> There's one for you, too.
He lied to me for months, maybe years.<eos> I'll never know.<eos> He humiliated me.<eos> He broke my heart in exactly the same way he broke yours.<eos> But, unlike you, I couldn't forgive him.
How do you get fugu into the country?<eos> Shh. Chef, that stuff can kill you.<eos> The toxins...<eos> It's like a drug if you prepare it correctly.<eos> Now... I made this just for you.
For a while.<eos> I'll need a new passport, new social.<eos> An entirely new you.<eos> Is that something that... someone in your line of work can do?<eos> For you?
They work for an organization called the Southland Cartel.<eos> So the money in that account with your name on it is drug money, which means it is only a matter of time before the cartel or the feds show up here to either kill you or arrest you.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Allie, I shouldn't... I should... I should never have come here.<eos> No, you did the right thing, but now the only thing I can do to help you is get you under federal protection.
- Those are the hair clips.<eos> - You're not buying a hair clip.<eos> It's just that earrings... They just seem a little...<eos> I don't know.<eos> Is there a professional there with you?
I have to say, my friend Valerie has done very well for herself.<eos> You think?<eos> Apart from that pesky FBI investigation.<eos> You know about that?<eos> I check up on you occasionally.
Is she like this with you?<eos> - No.<eos> - Come along, B-team!<eos> Great.<eos> I, got this for you.
Great.<eos> I, got this for you.<eos> It's perfect.<eos> Well, I didn't want you maiming some poor innocent woman, so I got in touch with a friend at the morgue.<eos> But... I didn't get you anything.
Probably best if there's no witnesses when I find him.<eos> Here, Tommy, let me help you with that.<eos> Theo! Thank God!<eos> I found out that the Kincaids were skimming money off the top.<eos> And I managed to get the money back for you.
Know what?<eos> Your mother worked here.<eos> Before you were born.<eos> And after.<eos> But she wanted a better life for you, so she gave you up, sent you far, far away.
No one deserves that fate.<eos> I'm a killer.<eos> Is that so?<eos> Captain!<eos> If you let me join your brigade, I'll kill for you.
Captain!<eos> If you let me join your brigade, I'll kill for you.<eos> What will your family think about that?<eos> I have no family.<eos> Well, then maybe I do have a place for you.
So... the girl who fell from the sky.<eos> Jane, look at this.<eos> It's working.<eos> I'm working.<eos> I'm proud of you, Jack.
In the water.<eos> I knew it was you the whole time.<eos> You weren't fooling anyone.<eos> I've heard enough from my sister.<eos> I don't need any more from you.
Stop.<eos> Dorothy, that man, he knew me.<eos> Are you a good witch... or a bad witch?<eos> Oh, I must say, The Wizard has outdone himself.<eos> Because he wants something from you.
Unfortunately, there's no right one, either.<eos> You're wrong about all of this.<eos> I didn't kill your sister.<eos> Liar!<eos> I will suck the lies out of you like marrow from a bone, or you can speak the truth now and save yourself the hurt.
How... how do you know?<eos> Comfortable?<eos> Maybe you need a good stretch?<eos> Look at me.<eos> Glinda will be coming here tomorrow and expects information from you.
And I helped you because you asked me to.<eos> And now I'm asking you... please.<eos> Please help me.<eos> You helping me was the worst thing that ever happened.<eos> So now I'm gonna do for you what I wish you'd done for me.
He's here. I heard him.<eos> Yes. Yes, of course you did.<eos> I'm sorry, father, I'll...<eos> I'll come and help you find him.<eos> You know I'm always here for you.
Which is why I need to ask you, where's the little witch?<eos> I can't tell you that.<eos> But if you let her go back to the north, she'll be safe, and so will you.<eos> Come!<eos> I have a proposition for you.
He was my father.<eos> I'm sorry he died.<eos> He didn't die.<eos> He was murdered.<eos> It's just the more I see of everything, the more I realize how hard it all is for you.
It's just the more I see of everything, the more I realize how hard it all is for you.<eos> Why are you talking?<eos> I'm trying to help.<eos> Everything you say is wrong.<eos> Everything about you is wrong.
But lucky for her, you learned a new trick.<eos> I didn't even think about it.<eos> The gauntlets. They... they just did something.<eos> You can control them now.<eos> They're becoming part of you.
Make these guns.<eos> We take them to war. A war on magic!<eos> I should be coming with you.<eos> Who will look after emerald city?<eos> No one better than you.
For business and for pleasure. No.<eos> We don't all exist for your benefit.<eos> You exist because Jane was paid to rebuild you.<eos> By me.<eos> The fact that I've developed feelings for you does not make you any less my property.
I lifted my spell.<eos> Your spell was worthless.<eos> It's hers that I can't break.<eos> I've tried.<eos> For you, for us, and I...
We have your guns.<eos> We no longer need The Wizard of Oz.<eos> Don't go.<eos> You can't go.<eos> What am I supposed to do without you?
Like... nothing.<eos> I died and came back to life.<eos> Surely I can cast a stupid spell.<eos> You don't summon magic.<eos> It comes for you.
For the Wizard?<eos> For me.<eos> We're done.<eos> Go your own way.<eos> Without you, there is no army.
When it was my time.<eos> You even discredited me.<eos> I'm the only one left who knows you're a fraud.<eos> It must hurt to know that no one will listen.<eos> I know the only reason you have kept me alive is because my work has value to you.
I'm the only one left who knows you're a fraud.<eos> It must hurt to know that no one will listen.<eos> I know the only reason you have kept me alive is because my work has value to you.<eos> Tell me what you need.<eos> I-I'll make it for you now.
Is that why the wizard animated the stone giant?<eos> Because he wants peace?<eos> He didn't.<eos> I did.<eos> How wrong roan was about you.
There is no fight left in emerald city.<eos> The true fight still comes for all of us.<eos> I brought our kind back from the dead.<eos> And I will take back what belongs to us.<eos> Emerald city does not belong to you.
A lot has changed since then.<eos> A lot has changed since then, but what has not changed is that when a man first needs you and thereafter calls you a friend, a little suspicion is a healthy thing.<eos> That'd make a lot more sense if I didn't need him just as badly as he needs me.<eos> I don't believe you do.<eos> Whatever he is to you, whatever you are to him...
Judge Adams and his... court, we have all seen in recent weeks since their arrival that their appetites are significant.<eos> Shall I expect to be reimbursed for the costs of this?<eos> You stood in my office and said you wished us to be friends.<eos> As my friend, I would think you would be eager to do your part to see our common enterprise survive its current crisis.<eos> I beg your pardon, my Lord, but have I not proved to you my friendship?
Every sight of you is a wonder<eos> You float on the edge of a sword<eos> You are life, Julia You are the beloved, Julia<eos> Pale-skinned, Julia A leopards tread, Julia<eos> Without you, life's not Worth a cent, Julia
- Come, I'll get you fed.<eos> When you went missing, I realised that I don't love you.<eos> Had you told me earlier, I wouldn't have come back.<eos> Love is too small a word.<eos> Without you, I have no reason to live.
He can remove it.<eos> How's grandpa?<eos> He must be fine. - What about the stroke?<eos> It was a lie.<eos> To keep me away from you.
OK, do whatever you want.<eos> I'll really jump.<eos> - At least take this opium.<eos> Oh, another lie?<eos> I got this for you, 'Akbari Afeem'.
'That sword will lead our nation to freedom.'<eos> 'That sword will break the shackles of slavery.'<eos> Mail has arrived!<eos> Baldev, mail has arrived!<eos> This medicine is for you?
I understand"<eos> - No, you do not understand!<eos> I can have you arrested for this.<eos> C'mon, David please"<eos> Excuse me, that's Major General Harding to you.
They're running out of ammunition.<eos> Take the sword and cross the bridge.<eos> And you?<eos> I'll hold them off, leave now.<eos> Not without you.
Can you really give me what I want?<eos> Anything for you.<eos> Will you take this to where it belongs, on the other side?<eos> Come on, now.<eos> I can't live without you.
- You find out where she works?<eos> - On Riverside.<eos> Hey.<eos> Oh, hey! How are you?<eos> - Good. How are you?
We'll be surfing, drinking Mai Tais.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I'm gonna do it.<eos> Yeah, there's no point in me doing this without you, you know?
- Are you serious?<eos> - Yes, I'm serious.<eos> Okay, don't shoot.<eos> I do all the shooting, okay?<eos> Okay, I'll corral them to you.
Hey, Karen, this is, uh, Ponch, Jon's partner.<eos> I'm with Jon at the LA Memorial.<eos> Uh, you should get here as quick as possible.<eos> He's in bad shape.<eos> How are you feeling?
I also have a catheter in and I didn't wanna be too sexy for the staff.<eos> Mmm-hmm, yeah.<eos> Tone it down a little bit.<eos> Are you posted here?<eos> I came to see you, dummy, and just wanted to brag about saving your life.
I didn't do it on purpose!<eos> It was an accident.<eos> I was trying to shoot Ray Kurtz.<eos> Well, you missed, and he's gone.<eos> You fucked up this whole case and when I called your captain to find out where you were, she told me she hadn't heard from you since you initiated a sexual exchange with her at 1:00 a.m.
A Reichspropagandaleiter.<eos> - What if they come back?<eos> - We'll be shot.<eos> He's visiting the South West controlled zone.<eos> Aren't you the clever one.
Aren't you the clever one.<eos> If I quit, would you still see me?<eos> Of course.<eos> - But don't.<eos> - It's all right for you.
You shouldn't be anywhere near here.<eos> Don't you know Whitehall has regular Gendarmerie patrols?<eos> When you stole those passes, you ended up on every Gestapo list in the occupied zone.<eos> Christ!<eos> It's not for you, it's for The Mall shooting.
The Germans view those SIPO passes you took as just about the most valuable piece of paper a foreigner can be given.<eos> A foreigner?<eos> ! - That's not how I meant it.<eos> - Yes, it is.<eos> That's what we are, as far as you're concerned - foreigners.
Was this justice for Jimmy?<eos> I don't know these people.<eos> Well, they're bloody animals.<eos> Who do you know?<eos> It's too dangerous for you, too, isn't it?
So, the younger Spode is dead too?<eos> As I understand it, yes.<eos> And your police officer followed Captain Hesse here?<eos> That's right.<eos> I will come to you later.
We should have listened to you.<eos> I can understand why you wouldn't trust me.<eos> That's what occupation does to us.<eos> What are we going to do to get rid of them, Doug?<eos> That doesn't sound like you.
If he was tortured, if he talked...<eos> Well, then we're buggered anyway.<eos> Well, I should try to get word to George Mayhew.<eos> No! Everything is in play now.<eos> I want you to stand ready to get out as soon as I get Barbara Barga to you.
You're the safer pair of hands to get it to America.<eos> Bernard Staines is dead.<eos> Beaten to death from what I can tell.<eos> What should we do? If he was tortured, if he talked?<eos> ! I want you to stand ready to get out, as soon as I get Barbara Barga to you.
I don't understand.<eos> It's not really safe for you to be with us.<eos> Or to know about this.<eos> So it's him, George.<eos> I thought wrong of you, Doug.
Operation's a go.<eos> Where the hell is the plane?<eos> Come on, Doug. Can't hang about.<eos> You've got 20 minutes to get to Bringle, Danny.<eos> I'll join you as soon as the King is dispatched.
What do you mean by that? By "go through you"?<eos> That she would... Outgrow me, maybe. Or figure me out or something.<eos> So i've always had this sense that-- That, you know, the day would come where she would just-- Where she would just not love me anymore, and--<eos> Celeste, how do you feel about what perry just said?<eos> I gave up my career for you.
Celeste, how do you feel about what perry just said?<eos> I gave up my career for you.<eos> I-i-- I left my family.<eos> I left my friends.<eos> I moved here for you.
Or the time when we went camping?<eos> I said, "Fucking mosquitos bite the shit out of me."<eos> Doesn't matter as long as our skin doesn't come in touch with DEET.<eos> What is your point, Nathan?<eos> My point is I did a lot of fucked-up things in our marriage, a lot of hoops I jumped through for you, and now I'm doing those same things for Bonnie.
Yeah, I know my history.<eos> I'm not trying to get pregnant.<eos> I'm just trying to help out a friend.<eos> What's the big problem?<eos> Why is it such a big deal for you?
We're friends.<eos> That's great!<eos> What do you and Ziggy like to do together?<eos> We just like playing and stuff.<eos> And he's nice to you?
The last time we had pizza and we went to the zoo, you told me we were moving to Monterey.<eos> What now?<eos> You're gonna go see a child psychologist.<eos> I think he plans on signing up for a class, that's all.<eos> Did he hit on you at all?
I... no, I didn't...<eos> I mean, I didn't... I didn't say that.<eos> He's...<eos> I mean...<eos> I pick up on things, not just from you, but from Perry.
Did I say he would be?<eos> Be careful where you step.<eos> I just painted the ceiling.<eos> Nothing's wrong.<eos> He's not avoiding you.
I saw something.<eos> There was a room.<eos> A door.<eos> - Yeah. - It's Gabriel.<eos> Holt, listen. I've got a tail for you.
Because I'm terrible at saying no.<eos> Because you deserve a little something.<eos> Is that what you're gonna wear?<eos> You just gonna stay over there?<eos> Carla said that I had to stay as far away from you as possible.
I'm sorry, Maddy.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> You should enjoy that.<eos> For us both.<eos> It's boring without you.
Ellipsis.<eos> You make me wanna stay in Los Angeles.<eos> Why would you go?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm moving closer to you.
She was supposed to keep you safe, not endanger your life by inviting strangers into the house.<eos> Olly isn't a stranger.<eos> He's not yours. What?<eos> He's not yours.<eos> And maybe he's interested in you now, but he's out there.
All that I have!<eos> Everything!<eos> Gift me your body.<eos> I love you.<eos> Hello, kitty. What can I get you?
Heads.<eos> Tails.<eos> I rigged the toss.<eos> Rigged games are the easiest to beat.<eos> It is always going to be tails because I don't want to work for you.
Who he really is?<eos> Well, I never.<eos> Mad Sweeney as I live and breathe.<eos> What a surprise.<eos> Southern Comfort and Coke for you.
Mad Sweeney as I live and breathe.<eos> What a surprise.<eos> Southern Comfort and Coke for you.<eos> Jack Daniel's for me.<eos> And these are for you, Shadow Moon.
Of course I do.<eos> Name your price.<eos> I just want to go to my wife's funeral.<eos> Okay? I just want to say goodbye.<eos> Now after that, yeah, fine, I'll work for you for $2,000 a week.
That's... that's a "We're in this together" thing.<eos> W-Was it love?<eos> Because if you were going to leave, you could have just told me, okay?<eos> I could've taken it.<eos> You know, I had a surprise for you.
And I know that why?<eos> Because four of them were about math.<eos> I like math.<eos> Who knew?<eos> I just wanted to come back better than when I went in... for you.
She gets on her knees.<eos> She takes what she don't want to, and we watch in easy fucking judgment and pretend we'd do a single thing different in her shoes.<eos> Hmm. I hear they blew up your altar.<eos> Darn.<eos> I have a new one to offer you.
I mean, they just pluck their food out of the freezer, throw it in the microwave, watch it spin around.<eos> Never once have they had to work for it, give thanks for it, or pray to you for it.<eos> Make them pray.<eos> Let them remind themselves it was a queen that gave them the harvest.<eos> Oh, they'll be hungry but then they'll turn to you, and they will pray to Ostara once again.
As if the difference between one side of that divide and the other could be quantified.<eos> Some believe that you can develop a last image seen off their retinas. Like a photograph.<eos> Death is usually the last enemy.<eos> Right but not for, uh... not for Jesus Christ.<eos> Oh, not for you.
It wasn't a perfect plan.<eos> Didn't account for divine intervention, did you?<eos> The whole fucking time, the robbery, Shadow going to jail, me dying, act of god?<eos> Just fucking with us to fuck with us?<eos> What do you think gods do?
Maybe 15?<eos> Enough.<eos> The elevators are locked.<eos> There's 300 feet of earth between you and the sun.<eos> What the fuck do you care about the rest of anything, anyhow?
And then when you get to the top...<eos> - No, no, you're coming with me.<eos> - I can't.<eos> No, you have to, please.<eos> Please, I came back for you, Gabriel.
There was time.<eos> There was time, if somebody was looking for her.<eos> There was time, but nobody, nobody was looking.<eos> You're all I got.<eos> I'm not gonna leave here without you.
Efficient, no-nonsense, effective.<eos> Who'd have thought you had it in you?<eos> He was underestimating you, sweetheart. They all are.<eos> Not a mistake I'll make.<eos> Yeah, well I don't want to work for you, I-Love-Lucy.
You bad news.<eos> I only come when matters are vital, as they are now.<eos> God, you are gorgeous.<eos> You have not aged.<eos> Hmm? And I brought you a present.
Make him not be here, or I'll make him not be here.<eos> I already invite him for dinner.<eos> I cannot uninvite.<eos> I come here only to share bread and information.<eos> What you choose to do with the latter is entirely up to you.
- 'Lacey?<eos> ' - Brody.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hey.<eos> Oh, this is crazy, I was just about to call you.
Whenever you're ready, Jordan.<eos> I'm sorry in advance if I'm a little nervous.<eos> Let's go.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> August, there's nothing out there for you.
'I'll send a car.'<eos> Wow!<eos> Uh... that's so sweet of you actually but, you know, my friends just put on their very first play and, um, I'm gonna be celebrating with them tonight.<eos> So let's make it a party.<eos> I mean, I'm not going without you.
Are you ready?<eos> I can't do it for you.
It's all I can fucking think about.<eos> 'Sup, brother?<eos> You done for the day?<eos> Alvey's got an appointment.<eos> Shit, I can hold some pads for you.
Oh, fuck.<eos> Shit.<eos> Where you going?<eos> Shit.<eos> You're fucking wild, man.
Jay disappeared, and then he came home high.<eos> Ah, fuck, really?<eos> Fucking kid loves chaos.<eos> Yeah, I wonder where he gets that from.<eos> Mnh. You?
Ah, fuck, really?<eos> Fucking kid loves chaos.<eos> Yeah, I wonder where he gets that from.<eos> Mnh. You?<eos> No, that would be you.
Oh, look at us, a couple of college students hanging out on campus!<eos> (sighs) Is it weird having me here?<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> It's awesome!<eos> - I'm so proud of you. - Hm.
Uh... it's Bay actually on Emmett's phone.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I totally deserve that.<eos> Look, I just wanted to make sure that... you knew what was going on with Emmett. I...<eos> I don't know if anyone called you.
It just naturally came up in conversation, and I thought, "What have I got to lose?<eos> (imitating Mike) "Kathryn... I thought you would have told John that the money went to swimming."<eos> (as herself) "Oh, I did, Mike.<eos> I did,<eos> "but apparently my husband decided to circumvent me and go directly to you to get what he wanted."
Would you like to tell us how long you've been here?<eos> Um... just over a year.<eos> Just over a year. You were one of the first.<eos> How have you been treated? Have you been treated well?<eos> - Have I been good to you?
"Faith."<eos> Oh, God.<eos> I have such contempt for that word.<eos> Show me someone who relies on faith and I'll show you someone who's given up control over whatever it is they believe.<eos> Sorry, there's nothing more I can do for you.
- I have to stop your shooting, Isla.<eos> - Sit down.<eos> I need you to come with me right now.<eos> Sit down, Will. This is just your memory.<eos> I'm a part of you. Sit down.
His heart's stopped, Thomas.<eos> Organs are shutting down.<eos> They're trying to bring you back.<eos> That's okay.<eos> If I die, I'll just come back here to you.
There's no need to sneak around.<eos> I know. I know.<eos> We have an old beater you can use to get around whenever you need.<eos> Well, thank you.<eos> Hey, I got a question for you.
You want me to stay on him?<eos> Uh, maybe I just picked up on the cheating.<eos> - Set off my alarms.<eos> - Yeah, you do have a pretty good instinct in that regard.<eos> How much longer do I have to keep doing shit for you?
Okay. Ready?<eos> What a performance.<eos> I mean, really, really captivating.<eos> - Hey, how you doing?<eos> - Good. How are you?
Well, there's free and then there's free.<eos> No.<eos> Something happened, Eddie.<eos> Why run now?<eos> Someone got to you, didn't they?
You earned it.<eos> Hey, uh, I'm sorry about not sticking up for you earlier with Audrey.<eos> No problem.<eos> I'm still... I'm still just sort of catching up on things.<eos> Was she always that mean to you when we were kids?
But like, you know. That's what I'm, like, going in for rig ht now.<eos> I'm Johnnie Keyes, man. Who are you?<eos> Are we In heaven?<eos> Baby, you're in the back seat of a Cadillac Brougham.<eos> That's as close to heaven as you're gonna get.
And so, I don't.<eos> I mean, I've done adult for a long, long time.<eos> I mean, there's other things that can be done that I'm also interested in that I would like to do since the adult business doesn't exist anymore.<eos> Since... Let it go to bed.<eos> - It's for you.
Speaking of, gotta go.<eos> Oh, yeah, great. Um...<eos> I'll see you later?<eos> You will!<eos> I even decided to like basketball for you, Justin.
I've been there.<eos> Now, it won't always be easy.<eos> It might even hurt a bit.<eos> Or a bit more than a bit.<eos> That depends on you.
I have gym with her, and she only wears sports bras.<eos> Maybe I save my nice shit for after hours.<eos> Damn, girl, you are slick!<eos> Listen, Laura, you ever want to swing the other way...<eos> You'd be the last person I called.
What about you?<eos> Yes, all of us.<eos> So you help the school, and cover the fact it's your fault too.<eos> It's not my fault.<eos> I know she was special to you.
That's not true.<eos> I don't get it, Courtney.<eos> It's the 21st century.<eos> How is this so hard for you?<eos> Was it hard for you?
These are the stupidest, most embarrassing things that I check every day, no matter what.<eos> Sometimes the silly things can mean more than anyone knows.<eos> Get a good one?<eos> Nothing earthshaking.<eos> You?
We're here.<eos> Welcome. Thank you for coming so far.<eos> Thank you for having us.<eos> Thank you.<eos> My mother will come and see you later.
~ Oh, Arthur.<eos> You need to sink your teeth into something.<eos> If not a book then some other pursuit.<eos> That was my intention.<eos> Anyway, it's been very nice talking to you ladies.
Part of me, I always felt that I'm running after you.<eos> -Trying to catch the train.<eos> -Girls!<eos> Thank you.<eos> Miss Merren would like to talk to you.
Any of them could have killed Conner.<eos> I had to get in between them.<eos> It was like being a worm, working your way into a rotten apple.<eos> Please tell me you're not politicians or diplomats.<eos> If you are a politician or a diplomat, it doesn't matter how beautiful or charming you are I just cannot talk to you,
Four new Maybachs.<eos> Wow, do we need all four?<eos> It is already arranged.<eos> I'll be in my own private air conditioning.<eos> I will be departing from you here.
What animal group are you?<eos> Giraffe.<eos> Damn.<eos> Joey Murphy.<eos> I'll be with you two in a moment.
No, I don't have it on me.<eos> I got my purse stolen, so my secretary's fed-ex'ing me a new one.<eos> Okay.<eos> - All right, just stay in your vehicle.<eos> - I'll be right back with you.
- Is she thrilled?<eos> The party's on Friday.<eos> Are you moving? No, just my books are.<eos> - Ready?<eos> - Yes. Headmaster Charleston will see you.
- Mr Collins, of course. I'm not going to sit with him for anyone!<eos> I had hoped to condole with your poor father and your mother. Father is still in London, and mother is not yet well enough to leave her room.<eos> Ah. Ah.<eos> I feel myself called on, not only by our relationship, but by my situation as a clergyman, to condole with you all on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under. Thank you, sir.<eos> Yes. Be assured, ladies, that Mrs Collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you in your distress, which must be of the bitterest kind, proceeding from a cause which no time can remove.
What was the one question?<eos> Oh, it is quite simple, really. You both left the ship this morning at 9:30 with the Colonel Clapperton, yes?<eos> You know we did. You saw us.<eos> Précisément.<eos> So, please tell me -- was Colonel Clapperton with you for the whole day, until you got back to the ship at 4:00 this afternoon?
Don't worry the chief is the boss' good friend. They'll do everything to find him.<eos> We'll be notified once he's found.<eos> - Come, let's eat - OK Manager!<eos> They're coming! Come in. Come in and sit down.<eos> Please sit. Let me introduce you.
It was really strong shit.<eos> This is very impressive.<eos> Very impressive.<eos> Frankly, we were a tad concerned with your performance history against a deal of this size.<eos> But after meeting you two face to face, we feel like we're in good hands on this one.
Think he's home?<eos> Does it matter?<eos> Detectives.<eos> This is our attorney.<eos> He's more than happy to speak with you and your supervisors.
Yellow looks like white at night.<eos> - And gray.<eos> It's a common car.<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> Someone wants to talk to you.
All of this mess will barely be a memory.<eos> No.<eos> I don't think I should attend the luncheon today.<eos> Please convey my regrets.<eos> In front of you is a man, age 32, suffering from splenic anemia.
I hate to disappoint.<eos> She's strictly a dancer.<eos> Half now, half later.<eos> Please, we must be discreet.<eos> I'll speak to you in a moment, yes?
She has limb-onset A.L.S.<eos> Two years now.<eos> We're here because Walter McClenahan has emerged as a suspect in the Red Team murders.<eos> You think Walt did this?<eos> I noticed that you and he had a certain... uh, connection; he seemed to listen to you.
I hope not, Corporal, I hope not. We don't get inspected here.<eos> Ever heard of a spot check?<eos> Captain John Watson, Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers.<eos> Sir. Major Barrymore won't be pleased, sir.<eos> He'll want to see you both.
Very funny.<eos> Very droll.<eos> Look, I popped a rib.<eos> Have you got a moment?<eos> I have to talk to you... professionally.
The Health Department's looking over them now.<eos> Any leads on Prodeman?<eos> Eric's still trying to track him down.<eos> Well, um... perhaps you and Mr. Deeks could, uh, brief our guests.<eos> I need to speak with the two of you.
Well, gentlemen, my work here is done.<eos> Subject to...<eos> They're clean?<eos> Something's got to be clean around here.<eos> Nice doing business with you, gentlemen.
Back then, he would eat crackers!<eos> Crackers are poison!<eos> Might as well eat a bag of sugar!<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Can we have a word with you gentlemen?
Because he fought with you? Because he disappeared.<eos> He came to work, left, never came back.<eos> It was in all the papers at the time.<eos> The police got involved, never found him.<eos> May I ask what sparked the disagreement between the two of you?
You have no idea who you're dealing with, do you?<eos> worked with my father and you still think you can win?<eos> You know nothing about him.<eos> Raghad...go find a nice dress to wear.<eos> The king will see you now.
I'm not giving you my social security number so I can claim the grand prize, and I'm not paying for any damn subscriptions for magazines that I know I'll never see.<eos> I'm the head psychic for the Santa Barbara police department.<eos> Well, come on in then.<eos> We're investigating the death of Mr. Fuller.<eos> And I am sensing some unresolved conflict between the two of you.
- I don't know,<eos> like promise or something.<eos> No, Tiff dropped it, so it's dropped. Ain't nothing past that.<eos> That's good.<eos> You know, the thing with the teachers and cops and whatnot, they always come at you like think they got you by the ass.
- Scratched? What do you mean?<eos> - Scratched? Man, what the...?<eos> I bribed the top people.<eos> I was in procedure to get this through. Come on.<eos> I'll be perfectly honest with you.
Plasmapheresis is working.<eos> She's gonna be fine.<eos> I know.<eos> I've got these.<eos> I can't even tell you how much I appreciate... the opportunity to meet with you.
-Your colleague is no longer with you.<eos> Which means I get his share.<eos> The note.<eos> Pay the man.<eos> It's been a real pleasure doing business with you gents.
Now, as to Mr Boythorn...<eos> MyBoythorn is a man of very low character.<eos> That may well be, Sir Leicester.<eos> But I encountered him today and he was certainly intemperate.<eos> But I formed the strong impression that this disagreement between you could be settled if you're prepared to consider a compromise.
-Yes, they will.<eos> Good.<eos> Believe me, you do not want to incur our wrath!<eos> What is the purpose of this?<eos> Mr. Appleton came here to cooperate fully with you.
Anson Stokes, he did this to me.<eos> I don't know how. I just...<eos> I know it was him.<eos> Anson Stokes is a former employee... at the self-storage yard that Mr. Gilmore owns.<eos> Apparently there was some bad blood between you two.
You were gonna get a deal.<eos> There's no law in this place.<eos> Anything goes.<eos> It's Thunderdome.<eos> - Is someone helping you?
Open up in there!<eos> What exactly are you doing in Brussels?<eos> I was hoping my wife might come and join me here... as she had done on one occasion since our separation.<eos> I fail to see how the departure of a friend... could have cast you into such despair.<eos> Did there perhaps exist between you and Rimbaud... other relations besides those of friendship?
No loitering around here.<eos> Haven't you got eyes in your head.<eos> I only wanted to ask you a question.<eos> Should I be too early to see Mr. Silas Brown, if I was to call around here at five-thirty tomorrow morning?<eos> I shouldn't be speaking to you by rights.
May I help you?<eos> Yeah, how you doing?<eos> My name's Jackson. This is Mr. Frank Dux.<eos> Are our rooms ready?<eos> Mr. Lin in Room 310 wants to see you after you check in.
- No need to translate. We heard.<eos> - Come on. - Yes.<eos> Shut up or I'll slap you! Act normal!<eos> Good evening.<eos> - Is she with you?
Thank you, Mrs. Hudson.<eos> Oh, thank you for your many considerations.<eos> A Scotswoman's breakfast, indeed, a silly bit of paper!<eos> Please, tell me how you got it, where it was!<eos> After I left you, I settled myself into the English countryside and spent a charming afternoon.
You're all so kind.<eos> So very wise.<eos> The three wise men, in fact!<eos> Yes.<eos> He must go with you.
Whereas we jewelers buy exclusively on the wholesale exchanges.<eos> That's already being done, Mr. Adamson.<eos> Oh. I think we've taken up enough of Mr. Adamson's time.<eos> Well, I'm sorry I haven't been able to be of more help to you, gentlemen.<eos> However, if I do hear of any unusual transactions in the marketplace, I'll be sure and contact you.
We'd appreciate it if you could call into the precinct when it's convenient.<eos> - But if I don't know...<eos> - The commissioner will explain better.<eos> Huebel claims to have spent the night of 2nd February in your house, and all the following day.<eos> I'll go with you to the precinct.
Wellington and Marlborough would spin in their graves, Major, what?<eos> 321 present, 83 in hospital, 404 men present or accounted for.<eos> You may dismiss.<eos> If you don't mind, Captain, I'm assuming command as senior officer of the camp.<eos> That is, of course, between you.
I, Ezra, take thee, Aria to have and to hold from this day forward... for better, for worse for richer, for poorer in sickness and in health to love and to cherish till death do us part.<eos> If anyone can show a just cause why this couple cannot lawfully be joined together in matrimony let them speak now or forever hold their peace.<eos> By the power vested in me I now pronounce you husband and wife.<eos> You may kiss the bride.<eos> I present you for the very first time Mr. and Mrs. Fitz.
- Wild.<eos> Are you feeling okay?<eos> - Totally.<eos> - She's great.<eos> We're gonna take such good care of you.
Where the hell were you?<eos> Tennessee. What the hell's going on in Tennessee?<eos> Muhammed Kalabi, the ICO guy from Syria who burned the effigy.<eos> What's the plan?<eos> I stand before you this evening as vice presidential candidate, as the First Lady of the United States, and most of all... as a citizen of this great country.
He bought me a gun and wanted me to carry it in my purse.<eos> - Did you?<eos> - No.<eos> I hid it in my closet.<eos> I show you what's been marked as People's Exhibit 12.
- I'm sorry.<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> No problem.<eos> Enjoy your flight.<eos> If you're seated in an emergency exit row, please review the responsibilities for emergency exit seating on the back of the safety information card located in the seat pocket in front of you.
- For all of us.<eos> - Sir.<eos> I think I met Bixby. Briefly.<eos> Some years ago, in Juan-les-Pins.<eos> And there was never anything between you?
Some Chinese guy on Canal Street.<eos> Canal Street.<eos> Did he also offer to re-tar your driveway?<eos> Unless you like insomnia, panic attacks, confusion, and psychosis, you don't want to make a habit out of this.<eos> I'm gonna be honest with you.
All new flooring, and did I mention we are in an A-plus school district?<eos> Great place to raise children.<eos> Drew Stommer?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I'll be right with you.
- wonder. - _<eos> For as long as we've looked up at the night sky that is what we felt.<eos> We named the planets that hang among the stars after our gods. And gave them the same power to control our fate.<eos> With the support of the space-going nations of the IMSF the Mars Mission Corporation has overcome the most daunting engineering challenges our species has ever faced.<eos> This allows the brave pioneers standing before you today, to bring humanity into a new era.
And all the sentiment aside, you might be a happier, healthier person because you didn't interact with your biological father when you were a child.<eos> The same might be true for Chivonne and her father.<eos> Ambush time.<eos> Mr. Vachs, we're, uh, consultants with the NYPD. Like to ask you a few questions. Mr. Vachs knows who you are and who you work for.<eos> He's not interested in speaking with you.
It's hard to see that.<eos> You did really good... yeah.<eos> - I better call Carol.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Mr. President, Madam Secretary, I'm sorry, but Admiral Hill needs to see you urgently.
Well, it's gonna break a lot of hearts on Sand Hill Road, but congratulations.<eos> We decided to go with you.<eos> Uh, we were told that you were going with Raviga.<eos> And I am happy to say that is no longer the case.<eos> We're really excited to be in business with you guys.
Look, before we start negging each other...<eos> - Negging?<eos> - It's a term used in sexual manipulation.<eos> Maybe not relevant here.<eos> We're really excited to be in business with you guys.
We're really excited to be in business with you guys.<eos> We actually see this lawsuit as a positive.<eos> We will win, and it proves that we have something worth suing over.<eos> And yet Raviga, Coleman Blair Partners, and Wood Opal Fund have all passed.<eos> We're really excited to be in business with you guys.
Obscene, insulting and ignorant.<eos> Ignorant?<eos> You called me a shit-riddled anal wasteland.<eos> You called me a chode gargling fuck-toilet.<eos> We're really excited to be in business with you guys.
The President is optimistic.<eos> All we ask is that you remain open-minded.<eos> I hope you'll convey our dissatisfaction directly to your husband.<eos> I'll be sure to share your concerns.<eos> Ambassador Underwood will remain in contact with both of you.
That's what I'm here for.<eos> Miss?<eos> - Will Dr Clarkson be moving to York?<eos> - No need to worry.<eos> He's going to stay right here and look after you.
What about you?<eos> I'll settle in the new editor and go back after that.<eos> Our butler is getting married on Saturday.<eos> - Which is quite a big thing.<eos> - Has he been with you a long time?
Can I help you?<eos> NCIS, Mrs. Hudson.<eos> Your husband home?<eos> Yes.<eos> We'd like to talk to both of you.
Milady Gamora.<eos> I'm here to fetch you for my master.<eos> Okay, this isn't creepy at all.<eos> We house the galaxy's largest collection of fauna, relics, and species of all manner.<eos> I present to you,
Well, we contacted the consulate and your paperwork was never processed.<eos> No Gabrielle reigert or Nina duvalier.<eos> That has to be a mistake.<eos> Let me guess.<eos> She told you she would contact you when your passport came in, so all Nina had to do was wander off at the appointed time into her waiting arms.
Look, two weeks ago, this thing happened in the cafeteria... Hey.<eos> The principal said we're not supposed to talk about it.<eos> About what?<eos> You'll have to ask him.<eos> The principal will be with you in just a moment.
You there?<eos> Chief?<eos> All right.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> We'll be with you in a minute.
"Looking for his next idea" is another way of saying "he's unemployed."<eos> Anyway, he has the aptitude and the free time to address problems regarding computer programming.<eos> His comments were quite salient.<eos> He is not an unintelligent man.<eos> Mr. Burnett will see you now.
Chris Sepka and Amy Kleinpass, are they your foster children?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Are they home?<eos> No, they're out.<eos> Okay, we'd like to come in and talk to you.
CBGB. Hey, you got that TV set band on tonight?<eos> Yes.<eos> Television. David bowie says that television is the most original band in New York.<eos> CBGB. If that's what you want, I can take care of it for you.<eos> Coming to you from the bowery of New York City...
Well, it seems that everyone wants to be here tonight.<eos> And why wouldn't they?<eos> To witness this demonstration of unity between East and West via this ancient and beautiful game.<eos> Now, I would like to thank our friend, the Russian ambassador, for coaxing our guest out of retirement.<eos> May I introduce to you the illustrious Dr Ivan Savaranoff.
Just grab your bag.<eos> - Oh, please, just listen. - Hey. - It's very important.<eos> - Excuse me. Excuse me.<eos> This girl's lost.<eos> Can I leave her with you?
This is the right move, isn't it? It's going to be great. Right, Phillip?<eos> Ooh! This'll just take a minute of your time, and then you can, uh, carry on your way. Why don't you and your son wait with Detective Lucas while my partner and I speak to your wife?<eos> - I would rather stay. - It's okay. Go with the detective, downstairs.<eos> We'll be just a moment.<eos> After you.
Um, I don't know.<eos> He said he had be somewhere in 15 minutes.<eos> You just missed him.<eos> Thank you, Mrs. Stanwyck.<eos> These officers will stay with you.
Bret's generosity is only exceeded by his capacity for forgiveness. Mm. Is Mr. stiles here?<eos> We need to speak with him.<eos> Unfortunately, Bret was called out of the country this morning.<eos> Convenient.<eos> But he asked me to answer any question you have. Won't you come this way?
And I know, Roger, it's Erzulie week, he would have thought it perfect.<eos> Erzulie is the voodoo goddess of love.<eos> Yes, so I understand.<eos> Ah, right.<eos> Well, we may need to speak to you all again later.
Which one? Uh, Lissie Calhoun.<eos> She was a nurse in Vietnam.<eos> Do you think we can talk to her?<eos> Uh, yeah. I mean, she's usually here in the afternoons.<eos> I-I could tell her to contact you.
Um, Henry has decided to try chemo.<eos> He's a fighter.<eos> He's always been a fighter.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll have the oncologist in to discuss the process with you.
- I want to thank you all for coming.<eos> Now, this fight is about legacy.<eos> It's about defending a name.<eos> And after the tragedy of Scotty Furmanek's death, the Fighting Furmaneks have a chance to rise from the ashes with the youngest member of their dynasty.<eos> I present to you the man himself, a legend in the making,
Hello.<eos> Ya.. this is Riana.<eos> Yes.. yes I did.<eos> But I'm going to India in 2 days.<eos> Okay, great.. I'll contact you soon.
The snacks are for the pregnant people.<eos> They said it was fine.<eos> He's not the father.<eos> You told me that already.<eos> So we're going to get started and then the doctor will come in and talk to you after we get a look, okay?
Seats eight.<eos> Harvard.<eos> I really want to go to Harvard.<eos> Groups of three, my section.<eos> Be right with you guys.
No.<eos> Well, do you know who he might've been with?<eos> Wes has a lot of friends.<eos> Okay.<eos> But he still lives at home with you, right?
Our friends did.<eos> They live in Jackson Hole.<eos> They called, said they saw a picture of Evelyn on TV, so I booked a jet immediately.<eos> So, please tell us, what do you know?<eos> I want to be honest with you.
Jarrod Prodeman-- he's a formerly highly respected epidemiologist.<eos> Our suspect is on the mainland with nine vials of smallpox.<eos> I need Hetty to send a team to LAX right now.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, as we begin our descent, please make sure your seat backs and tray tables are in their full upright position.<eos> Your seat belt should be securely fastened and all carry-on luggage should be stowed underneath the seat in front of you or in the overhead bins.
Yeah, and we have the D.A.'s file and the newspaper clipping to make the case that you did not drive that car.<eos> [Exhales] What about Mr. Rence?<eos> He won't be attending today.<eos> The board will now hear from those speaking on behalf of Lea Ferran.<eos> Thank you for allowing me to appear before you, the parole board, today.
The first lady is staying at the President's side.<eos> She was not harmed.<eos> The Vice President just landed on the South lawn.<eos> Why isn't she briefing us instead of you?<eos> The Vice President isn't briefing you because our national security protocols demand that her safety be secured above all.
Number 10 Downing Street.<eos> This is it, steady the buffs old girl.<eos> Good afternoon, Prime Minister.<eos> I should just like to say... that I take very seriously the trust... the British people placed in me today... and I will work hard every day to live up to that responsibility.<eos> And now, I should like to share with you a prayer... of St Francis of Assisi:
- Nice to meet you all.<eos> - Nice to meet you.<eos> - Danish?<eos> - Thank you, no.<eos> I have to be honest with you... well, I never imagined I'd be invited inside these walls.
It was dinner.<eos> Now it's breakfast.<eos> Well, looks like Colonel Mustard was killed on the deck with a lead pipe, maybe lead bullets, and... only by interrogating each and every one of you individually...<eos> It's Albert Finney, doing, uh, Hercule Poirot-- 1974's Murder on the Orient Express.<eos> Well, the murderer very well could be with us now, so, excuse me-- can I please have you all take your seats; we will get to you one by one.
- Please, have a seat.<eos> Can I get you anything? Are you thirsty?<eos> Would you like some... Soda pop or coffee, nothing?<eos> - I'm fine, thank you.<eos> May I speak with you and your wife privately, Mr. Cleek?
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for coming here today.<eos> Quentin Sainz placed this ad because your lawsuit made it clear that his drug had side effects that he didn't know about.<eos> We wanted to know how widespread this problem was. We had an outpouring of response.<eos> Not from people struggling like yourselves, but from people desperate to keep the drug available.<eos> You think we're lying. You're here because you think this company has been hiding things from you.
as he walked in each time. Everything has been preserved exactly as it was.<eos> So just follow me up the stairs.<eos> We'll start at the top of the house.<eos> Now we move in to Dickens' study.<eos> And directly in front of you, you'll see an original copy of A Christmas Carol... arguably one of Dickens' most famous books.
There was a second one.<eos> The shooter.<eos> - Sure it wasn't him?<eos> - Positive. The other one had the gun.<eos> We'll be contacting you again.
We're here about your son Trevor.<eos> The, uh, police just informed us about Trevor's death.<eos> I'm so very sorry for your loss.<eos> We're here because Michael hired me to track you down.<eos> He felt it was important to meet with you.
This is Edward and Alice Costigan, the couple that witnessed the 1-8-7 in the park last night.<eos> They've got a description of the perp for you.<eos> I'm sorry. I have some allergies.<eos> H-have a seat.<eos> Oh. Be right with you.
A-Amanda's sister, Robin, is still missing.<eos> The Coast Guard sent out divers this morning, but, uh... there's no sign of her.<eos> So Robin Reeves may still be alive.<eos> ...normal upbringing, but it hasn't been easy.<eos> So they were stationed with you at the Embassy in Manila?
Nice neighborhood.<eos> Well, we can hear you, would you like to dedicate it to someone.<eos> Yes, to Sofia.<eos> Well, "Push the Air", is for her.<eos> Well, you know....
What's up?<eos> Look... I know he's angry with me, but I really have to see him. It's important.<eos> Can I?<eos> Yeah, rolling, Gar...<eos> And now, ladies and gentlemen, I give you the grand finale.
- Now, go help Loker. - Thank you very much.<eos> Dr. Lightman.<eos> I'm Han Yong-Dae, the ambassador's assistant.<eos> Could you and Dr. Foster come with me?<eos> He'd like to speak with you.
- No.<eos> - No. - Talk to me, sweetheart.<eos> The Secretary of the Army has asked me to express... his deep regret that your son, Walton Flanigan... died yesterday in Iraq.<eos> - No. The Secretary of the Army extends his deepest sympathy... to you and your family in your tragic loss.<eos> A Casualty Assistance Officer will contact you within a few hours.
And you are?<eos> Jack Shaw.<eos> This is my wife Irene.<eos> They won't let us in.<eos> Can I talk to you over here for a minute?
- Oh, thank you.<eos> Thank you, Ben, I shall take over from here.<eos> Good morning, Lady Hamilton. Sir Ralph.<eos> I'm Anna Thornton-Wilton, Special Guests Relations Manager. And I shall be looking after you throughout your stay with us.<eos> I shall be organising your menus, booking your cars and beauty treatments and liaising between you and our staff.
What happened to susan lucas,after dr.NPrender told her the whole thing was a mistake, that her father never abused her?<eos> She became my patient.<eos> We'd like to speak with her.<eos> Give me your number. I'll pass it along.<eos> If she wants to get in touchNwith you,I'm sure she will.
Maybe later.<eos> Hi, folks. Good afternoon.<eos> My name's Jason Street.<eos> Take a look at this, a look around.<eos> If you've any questions, come back and find me or Timothy here will be happy to answer it for you.
There was a power issue.<eos> The cells were open for a short time and... ..Sonja escaped.<eos> She was in your custody.<eos> How could she escape from a police station?<eos> She's not contacted you?
The human mind is a vast universe.<eos> An inner cosmos that we are only now beginning to explore.<eos> Our next speaker is one of the nation's leading cosmonauts.<eos> A rising star in the field of neuroscience and a prized member of the Leyland faculty.<eos> I give you Alex Nelson.
All right, Uncle...<eos> Bye, Pa!<eos> Make haste, Mr Clennam.<eos> 'Less you want to spend the night here.<eos> I'll be with you directly.
I shouldn't be telling you guys this, but Becca is my absolute favourite.<eos> Thank God!<eos> I thought you were gonna come down on her for being a Satanist.<eos> I think it's safe to say that whole thing's just a phase.<eos> It probably has something to do with whatever might be going on between you two. I'm sorry.
It's humiliating.<eos> Well, maybe because he doesn't have a job or whatever, it's... you know, it's his way of making up for it.<eos> You know, like, he, uh... he hunts for food or whatever.<eos> That's a very interesting observation and all, but no. I don't think so.<eos> I mean, it's not like you guys are the munsters or anything.
And the lamp?<eos> Noticed a bulb was out.<eos> Does ellen know that you're here?<eos> No.<eos> Patty hewes told me to extra special care of you.
Well, I'm just surprised that Kyle...<eos> Sorry, we'll still not used to his real name.<eos> Oh, I understand.<eos> Why didn't he contact us sooner?<eos> Well, he missed you terribly.
You could feel good about that.<eos> It's like I can't picture myself without her.<eos> I just wish there was something I could do to change her mind.<eos> Well, you can't play it cool-- that ship has sailed.<eos> Did anything like this ever happen between you aen
With my son?<eos> Yes,sir.<eos> - They didn't tell us.<eos> - No,ma'am,they wouldn'T.<eos> Look,I wanted to see you personally.
Yo, dog, it says... it says "transaction denied," dog.<eos> Yo, what... what do I do?<eos> We're going to take the ATM machine with us to Mexico.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, please rise for the national anthem.<eos> I give you Rebekah Del Rio.
Well done, soldier.<eos> Take that target.<eos> You can't miss.<eos> Come on, let's go, let's go!<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Krysta Now,

Hi, I'm trying to get a flight tonight, for tonight, from Miami to New York.<eos> Yes, I know there's a hurricane.<eos> Nothing is flying out? What do you mean, nothing?<eos> It's for Miranda Priestly.<eos> She's a client of yours. She's flown with you before.
Excuse me?<eos> We had an appointment?<eos> But I guess that doesn't mean a goddam thing.<eos> An emergency came up, sir.<eos> We will get to you, as soon as we can.
Laser photocoagulation to fix the eye, and a high dose of benzimidazole to kill the worms.<eos> Wait a minute, that's it?<eos> He's going to be okay?<eos> Good news.<eos> He's going to be with you for a long, long time.
He ruined her first Wordloaf.<eos> Look at me, sittin' here depressed when I'm surrounded by the happiest people in the world: writers.<eos> Before Moe reads his keynote poem, I would like to stake my claim to any unfinished garlic mashed potatoes.<eos> So please, if you would pass them clockwise up to table one, I will collect them later.<eos> Now, I give you Moe Szyslak.
Its touch-and-go at this point.<eos> We're trying to stabilize him... so we can perform this last surgery... but this bullet is in a very difficult place.<eos> I need to know, if things go badly... should we resuscitate?<eos> What do you mean, "If things go bad"?<eos> I have to be honest with you.
As you are all certainly aware, a mission of this expense is very expensive.<eos> We just wouldn't shoot two knuckleheads up there to try and hit Mars.<eos> No, sir. Hours of serious thought have gone into this undertaking.<eos> And now let me introduce our intrepid space travelers the only men we could find that were bold enough to overlook certain shortcomings and volunteer for this first-ever manned mission to Mars.<eos> I give you Majors Biff Buzzard and Buzz Blister.
- My love life? It's non-existent for right now.<eos> And, nobody knows what the future has in store for us. So, let's see.<eos> Anyway, thank you very much.<eos> Really nice talking to you. Please enjoy the party. Thank you.<eos> Thank you. - Thank you. Thank you.
Where's sergeant Gabriel?<eos> As you know, we have an understanding, which is pretty much in your agreement.<eos> Excuse me, Dr. Dawson.<eos> Mr. and Mrs. Schiller, Brenda Leigh Johnson, L.A.P.D.<eos> Can i talk to you for a moment over here, please?
We suspect Mr. Moktari was involved with that pipeline.<eos> As a matter of fact, my colleagues were in the process of tracking... $2 million in cash that had just come into Moktari's possession at the time he was killed.<eos> How did you know about that money in the first place?<eos> Unfortunately, that's classified.<eos> But i can share this with you.
"Bore-a-Million Kinsey."<eos> His new book, The Origin of Higher Categories in,<eos> Cy-nips?<eos> Close enough. ..traces the origin of the gall wasp back to its birthplace in the Upper Cretaceous.<eos> So, now, I give you Dr Kinsey.
911 operator, what's your emergency?<eos> I need help.<eos> Ma'am?<eos> Ma'am, are you there?<eos> Ma'am, we're here with you.
And I'm in the house where I think they're keeping him.<eos> We think we found you.<eos> Can you verified your address?<eos> Yes. 125, route 77.<eos> And do you know if there's anyone else in the house with you, ma'am?
The guy who says he's Danny Rand?<eos> - He escaped from a mental...<eos> - There's nobody here but me.<eos> And I can take care of myself.<eos> - If he does try to contact you...
What do you mean?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> None of this sounds like John.<eos> He wasn't this kind of person.<eos> And there's nothing I'm not telling you.
Thank you.<eos> It's the best present anyone's ever gotten me.<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> - To see Stella.<eos> I don't think she's gonna want to talk to you.
What are you doing here?<eos> They're tracks, they definitely came this way.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Mrs. Stella, that woman was here.<eos> She wanted to talk to you.
Best of luck, Jamison.<eos> I'm just here as a courtesy, Ms. Vaughan, to let you know that if your fiancé doesn't turn himself in in the next 24 hours, I'm going to have to charge you as a co-conspirator in his escape.<eos> You're gonna have a very hard time finding evidence to support that charge.<eos> Really?<eos> If I arrest you and take your cellphone, I won't find any evidence that he's contacted you in the last 24 hours?
I don't know.<eos> Is there a professional there with you?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Put them on the phone, please.<eos> He would like to talk to you.
Yes, you did.<eos> Thank you.<eos> But... we only received that invitation after the suicide toll had rapidly reached a million.<eos> And during that time, celebrities, athletes, even a close colleague of yours, all ended their lives.<eos> Which is why I agreed to sit with you and try to calm the waters.
It's a safe-conduct for Christmas Eve.<eos> How do I get to the other side?<eos> Tell the soldiers you have a message for the mayor.<eos> They'll recognise my car.<eos> Do you mind if I pray with you?
Uh, the point is, I had to go, and there was no one else.<eos> Plus, Franny adores Quinn.<eos> Tell me about him. What's your connection?<eos> We're former colleagues. We worked together at the Central Intelligence Agency.<eos> Why is he living with you?
He believed that Franny was in danger, which, you know, she was, sh... from people throwing rocks, from the police.<eos> He was doing what he could to keep her safe.<eos> Do you think that Franny felt safe?<eos> I'm sure she was frightened, but she's a strong girl.<eos> There's something I want to share with you. What?
That was Brett O'Keefe on the phone.<eos> He says he made the video.<eos> He admits it now when we already know?<eos> He says he's responding to your call to come out of hiding.<eos> He wants to discuss it with you on his show this afternoon.
You'll have to fight for every bastard thing you've got, cos the only person who's ever really going to love you... .. is you.<eos> And that's why I'm going to show you what to do with these.<eos> Midwife calling.<eos> I've had a breakthrough on the bed-wetting front.<eos> But you took Mickey to the hospital about his eyes.
What is this about?<eos> I..<eos> I was gonna go to Principal Hackett.<eos> But I thought..<eos> I thought it may be better to talk to you.. First.
How does transferring a body protect evidence?<eos> Ms. Keating has a history of committing unlawful actions to win her cases.<eos> I was trying to protect all of our evidence.<eos> Transferring the body broke chain of custody, according to Rule 901.<eos> Anyone, including you, could have manipulated the evidence.
And if second chance doesn't work?<eos> Miss Venediktov...<eos> Eh, he's--he's fine.<eos> Well, he's unconscious, but he--look, I'm sorry that I scared you the other night.<eos> I just--I--I need to speak with you. I-- well, it's like I said, I knew your-- your children, Taiana and Vlad.
Mrs. LaBelle, I know this is difficult. I'm just, I'm just doing some follow up.<eos> So, gone ten minutes and when you come back that's, that's when you see Billy in the water.<eos> And that was about ten a.m.? Yeah.<eos> Mrs. LaBelle, I spoke with your friend, Rosalyn this morning,<eos> She was with you the night before Billy died.
Cool.<eos> Bye.<eos> Ms. kline. Yes?<eos> This is Oliver in Dr. Turner's office.<eos> He'd like to see you in the office today. I, I was just in there.
Oh, I'm sorry, that's beyond our jurisdiction.<eos> I was assured by the Chief Constable of your full cooperation.<eos> Detective Constable Morse will be on hand throughout to ensure nothing untoward befalls.<eos> You can rely on him.<eos> What is it, do you think, with Mrs Pettybon?
Her pelvic abnormalities bar a vaginal delivery, thus a caesarean section is necessary.<eos> Labour has begun at 37 weeks, therefore we must proceed immediately and get her to theatre.<eos> Bring her in.<eos> I'm sorry about that, Mrs Reed.<eos> I'll be with you in the operating theatre.
You sent all the e-mails.<eos> He's very industrious.<eos> Yes. Nice to met you.<eos> Ms. Jaymes, I'm your biggest fan.<eos> I can't believe I'm getting to meet you face-to-face.

And I don't regret a single day of it.<eos> I would do...<eos> Go away!<eos> Hey.<eos> Detective Santos, can I please have a conversation with you in the interrogation room?
Nurse Barton will be in to help you get in bed, okay?<eos> Anything else you need?<eos> Maybe some water?<eos> Who... who are you?<eos> I'm your friend, Mason, who helps take care of you.
I'll take care of Mrs. Samuels.<eos> My husband's doing that. He's throwing up.<eos> - Oh, poor thing, you must be so worried.<eos> - I am.<eos> - I'll come right over with you.
Can he stop?<eos> Probably not on his own, but if he'll allow us, we can help him.<eos> Okay.<eos> We'll do whatever it takes to get him healthy.<eos> Before we discuss the course of psychotherapy, I'd like to talk to you and your husband about repairing the physical damage.
Please, please.<eos> Please, I'm begging you.<eos> Please, please!<eos> Please, Mrs. Waterford. Please. Please!<eos> What is wrong with you?
- Yes.<eos> - What is he saying?<eos> - Alight, alright!<eos> I will.<eos> He wants to talk to you.
No.<eos> Everything that you've told me so far can be found in these documents.<eos> So if I'm to believe you are possessed by James Gillies, you'll have to tell me something that only James Gillies knows.<eos> I'm waiting.<eos> He wants to speak to you again.
I still haven't had the pleasure.<eos> You working a case or running for office?<eos> No, no, I don't have the stomach for politics.<eos> I am formally opening a file on Donnie Pomp's disappearance, though.<eos> I look forward to interviewing you.
What? I'm so sorry.<eos> We did our best.<eos> - I want to see him.<eos> - I understand.<eos> Of course. We'll contact you as soon as the Medical Examiner releases the body.
I-It's not real.<eos> Would you even know?<eos> Mrs. Raven.<eos> Hello, Link.<eos> Father Romanov would like to talk to you.
I need to speak to Captain Martens.<eos> Come.<eos> What's on your mind, Sergeant?<eos> My dad.<eos> He's going to be very disappointed in you.
You're much prettier when you don't speak. And no, neither of us are going anywhere.<eos> Go and lie back down. I'll be over shortly.<eos> Nice to have you back, old friend.<eos> I'm back, bitch.<eos> What about you, Princess Eleanor?
He's trying to jack his national profile - as fast as he can.<eos> - And it's working.<eos> There's already talk of a Bowman White House run.<eos> And he's trying to eliminate his competition, ma'am.<eos> I mean, introducing this bill without consulting you?
Her name is Hannah.<eos> Please call her Hannah.<eos> Uh, the baby will be kept in the hospital's NICU for observation for as long as she needs.<eos> And then she can come home?<eos> And then she can go with you.
One of the great joys of being the mayor is being able to make this city a better place.<eos> - Mayor Tinsdale.<eos> - Excuse me, won't you?<eos> Oh! Of course.<eos> I need to talk with you about the things you approved this morning. OK.
We need to tell the council members about our financial shortfall.<eos> And see the disappointed looks on their faces when they learn that I've let them down?<eos> - I could put it in a memo.<eos> - But I'd still feel the shame.<eos> And what should I tell people who want to speak with you?
My boyfriend was being arrested for something that he didn't do.<eos> I have a temper, not a drug problem.<eos> What time did you leave the club?<eos> I don't know. 2:00?<eos> And Mr. Ward left with you?
Juanita Phillips, with Child Services.<eos> Miss, you don't understand.<eos> I can explain everything.<eos> Simone, I'm gonna need you to come with me.<eos> No, you're crazy if you think I'm going back there.
- What about Simone?<eos> Can she...?<eos> - I'm gonna request the judge grant you temporary guardianship, pending a formal hearing.<eos> We need to do what's right by Simone.<eos> And right now, that's being with you.
Can you find somebody who can?<eos> You know Deeks is a lawyer, right? He told me.<eos> Repeatedly.<eos> Of course he did.<eos> All right, I'm gonna level with you.
If you could find him, talk to him, he would tell you that I had nothing to do with this.<eos> Who is he?<eos> What's his name?<eos> Aidan Macallan.<eos> He'll talk to you. He respects you.
-We need to initiate evacuation now.<eos> -No, General.<eos> We'll do it when I say so.<eos> I'm really sorry. I know I agreed to do this, but I have to go pick up my kids.<eos> Okay. Well, what if I just rode in the car with you?
He may have been.<eos> He never stays put in one place long.<eos> What's this about?<eos> A young boy disappeared about twenty years ago, it was rather notorious.<eos> Has he ever spoken to you about this case?
Miss Roy.<eos> We're testing each soil sample, measuring the moisture retention of the different types of soil in which the bodies were found.<eos> Any results so far?<eos> It's too premature to draw any conclusions.<eos> Happy though I am to be working with you, Miss Roy, I don't know why you are having me repeat this test.
Mr. Bryant, I understand that your situation is<eos> - complicated.<eos> - No, it's not. It's not complicated.<eos> She got mixed up with this kid, and I just feel like if we could talk, we could work it out.<eos> But I just got this text from her saying that I can only talk to you, so, can you help me?
Does "no" mean the same thing in New York that it means in New Jersey?<eos> Just answer the question.<eos> I've never seen that man before.<eos> Well, that's funny because Detective Bell met a witness last night that says that that man paid a visit to your morgue last week.<eos> He talked to you for a while.
- Did we get it on you? - No, no, no.<eos> It's... it's fine.<eos> It's your daughter, I take it?<eos> I'm-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.<eos> At least, she's talking to you.
These questions are for your protection, sir, I assure you.<eos> Right, just like Judge Kaplan assured us there was no pressure when he imposed that unofficial deadline for the verdict?<eos> Or the way he's been not-so-subtly steering us to a guilty verdict?<eos> Judge Kaplan is pressuring the jurors?<eos> I shouldn't be talking to you.
Look at her.<eos> She sacrificed for this country.<eos> Your job is to thank her for it.<eos> I know, and...<eos> I'm sorry, ma'am, is he with you?
Pain can make you strong, or it can make you stupid.<eos> Hope those green eyes are worth it.<eos> - Please.<eos> I wanted to tell you this in person.<eos> Teo will not be working with you from here on out.
You don't have to send me down for the CT scan.<eos> I can tell you what it's gonna show.<eos> Dr. Halstead, I got a message you wanted to see me.<eos> Yes and no.<eos> Actually, Ms. Dempsey would like to speak with you.
NCC, Bonnie Mahesh speaking.<eos> Bonnie, Owen Mitchell.<eos> Mr Mitchell, hello.<eos> Who did you want to speak to?<eos> Janet, Tony? Ah, actually you.
Come on, don't be such a sook.<eos> See you at remand tomorrow, then.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I assume Richard told you about the new evidence?<eos> Yes, which means no deals with you.
You vanished at the ball.<eos> Yes.<eos> I thought it would've been selfish of me to seek an encounter with Darcy.<eos> Would've ruined the ball for anyone who witnessed it.<eos> I am very sorry i lost the pleasure of dancing with you, though.
I will make no such promise.<eos> Then I shall protect the dignity of a far superior man.<eos> Do you dare to face me in combat?<eos> I do not.<eos> For to take arms against you, my lady, would be to take arms against england.
- Yes, sir.<eos> - I pray to god for forgiveness.<eos> I pray to god for these sinners.<eos> Take a look at that.<eos> So, one of the boys involved in the incident claims to have had a phone conversation with you where you ordered them to do the victim harm.
- A policeman who steals children!<eos> A great man!<eos> She was hiding in the car.<eos> He did not know.<eos> she did not want To spend the weekend with you.
Shut yours, you grunty wanker.<eos> Kiss my ass, you filthy minger.<eos> Kiss mine, you wobbly shed box.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - Madam Dwarf, we have no quarrel with you.
But the girl's got a conscious.<eos> He's been using the committee as his puppet theater.<eos> Senator!<eos> Hi, you.<eos> Don't go anywhere. I want to talk to you.
The victim, the deceased, Mr. Boone Lassiter, he was one of these people.<eos> Yes.<eos> And were you always on his flights?<eos> Most of them. He'd request me.<eos> And when did he last fly with you?
And I'm not allowed to talk to the women.<eos> Fine.<eos> Forget it.<eos> I'll hold it. Women are tough, right?<eos> Are you okay, ma'am?
God must've packed up and left with the rest of 'em.<eos> Shit.<eos> How would someone spend an hour in this town?<eos> If your name was Dollar Bill, is that where you'd be?<eos> All right, listen, you stay here with Lady.
Madam Florence.<eos> I was out and about and I suddenly realised I was in your neighbourhood.<eos> - What a happy coincidence.<eos> - Indeed.<eos> - Is Mr Bayfield with you?
No, Nurse. You know my policy and I am standing firm.<eos> Babies are a two-handed job.<eos> I do not handle newborns any more.<eos> Here, here. It's creased but clean as a whistle.<eos> You make sure you speak to Mrs Williams.
Was he upset lately?<eos> Problems at home?<eos> Eli never had a bad day.<eos> He was always so cheerful and optimistic, the gentlest person I knew.<eos> Is it possible he was hiding something from you?
And I'm sure his suicide is what brought you to this terrible place.<eos> Get some help, Gemma. And stay away from Kieran Ashton.<eos> Yes. Yes, of course I remember you.<eos> Vanessa Hamilton.<eos> Yes, I'm sure he'll come and meet you.
We haven't accomplished everything we set out to do.<eos> But the one thing my constituents have always had... is the pride that they take in being represented by one of their own.<eos> I refuse to rob them of that.<eos> Thank you for your time, Congresswoman.<eos> We'll reassess our thinking and get back to you. Thank you.
Nancy was desperate to come.<eos> She sent you this.<eos> I'll see you tomorrow.<eos> Now, would you like me to hang that up for you?<eos> Has she spoken to you? Has she told you anything?
You have your own bathroom with a shower.<eos> Hot water is ample here.<eos> I'd be happy to give you a tour of the facilities if you'd like.<eos> I'd actually like to meet with Dr. Cheng and Dr. Ziegler.<eos> Absolutely. They're eager to meet you.
I won't.<eos> Do you have an idea about Mr Spector's pre-morbid IQ?<eos> He was tested as a child and scored in the very superior intelligence band.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It's been a pleasure talking to you.
Thank you.<eos> Can I talk to you... alone?<eos> Without the tape?<eos> This is DC Gail McNally suspending the interview at 10.43pm.<eos> I haven't been... I haven't been completely honest with you.
An animal did that.<eos> Yeah. You're right.<eos> Did I raise an animal?<eos> What?<eos> He wants to talk to you.
I wasn't feeling well, Charlie.<eos> He's an important client.<eos> He expects and deserves to be treated with respect.<eos> Lucy could've played with him.<eos> He flew in from Macao to play with you, specifically, not Lucy.
He had a question about your father's account.<eos> My father?<eos> I don't handle my family's stuff anymore.<eos> He should talk to my mother.<eos> It was clear he wanted to talk to you. He said it was urgent.
-His aunt, Wanda.<eos> -Isn't school out?<eos> -I just wanted to check in with him. - He left his essay in my office.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Thank you. I also- - I wanted to talk to you.
Have you noticed any movement out of the ordinary in your neighbourhood?<eos> - Or in your workplace?<eos> - You mean if someone followed me?<eos> No, I'd have done something.<eos> Has anyone unexpected or unknown tried to contact you?
Where's the monument for Eleanor Roosevelt that's shaped like a vulva?<eos> I want to speak to those people directly.<eos> Consider it done.<eos> Can I just say how happy I am I made the choice I made?<eos> I'm really impressed with you.
- Moment. I was just to...<eos> - Good evening.<eos> I'll get the boys.<eos> - Wait.<eos> It's you I want to talk to.
They'll take you down now to get your statement.<eos> This is Detective Duko.<eos> He's with the union.<eos> Don't you worry, Detective.<eos> I'll be with you the whole time.
Is that better, buddy?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Ah. The accident is not why she's in surgery.<eos> It's the adrenal tumor.<eos> It's a... it's like a time bomb inside of her, and it could have happened anytime, anywhere, so that has nothing to do with you.
I know.<eos> I won't.<eos> Ellis eads.<eos> We are honored to share this privilege with you, Mr. Axelrod.<eos> With you, too, Mrs. Axelrod.
Have you found the wireless receiver?<eos> Uh... got it.<eos> That should cut off the Machine's access to the door.<eos> Thank you, Ms. Groves.<eos> There are perks to sharing quarters with you.
What do you think?<eos> Go to hell.<eos> We'll find it.<eos> That hard drive, it's our best chance to get a lead on Reese.<eos> I'll come with you. No.
- Hi, Mark.<eos> - Ms. Raichlein.<eos> I have a 10:20 tee time, but we wanna hit the range first.<eos> And I requested Stewart on my bag.<eos> Yeah, um, Mr. Kellum from the membership committee wanted to speak with you.
So, if you'll just crack open your files, we'll get to work, and I'm sure this will all be done in no time.<eos> Chief, would you mind showing my men around?<eos> Guys.<eos> And you... Must be the Agent Carter that I keep hearing so much about.<eos> Have I been dying to talk to you.
You're refusing to reveal his identity?<eos> Call it independent thinking.<eos> You know, the Hollywood Ten thought they were independent thinkers, too.<eos> A communist witch hunt has no relevance to the work of the SSR.<eos> But it should be relevant to you...
I still don't know why I had to take a punch.<eos> It's the least you could contribute. He's already throttled me twice.<eos> I need a drink.<eos> What happened, Mr. Hunt?<eos> I ain't talking to you.
The council has determined to shut down the Isodyne program.<eos> The woman's body is being taken care of.<eos> You think the men I work for are just criminals.<eos> They're in everything!<eos> Have I been dying to talk to you. - What did you say?
Please.<eos> We won't know anything for a long time.<eos> They just got started.<eos> Let's get comfortable.<eos> Do you know how long I've been sitting out there waiting to talk to you?
Well, I know, but I'm gonna get him in there.<eos> Well, whatever you do, I'm going to need to know that he has a doctor and a plan for treatment, or I'm going to return him to this facility.<eos> No, this place can't help him.<eos> Doing nothing isn't, either.<eos> Social Services will be contacting you in the next 48 hours.
So, the kids went to get ice cream.<eos> Mm-hmm. Haven't we been through this?<eos> There are just a few gaps in our time line.<eos> What gaps?<eos> Was John with you at the rally the entire time?
I was quite divorced from the man I was or wanted to be.<eos> But my... unique nature... left me feeling loathed and loathsome.<eos> And then I was introduced to a woman who saved my life.<eos> A mental doctor of a sort.<eos> I was skeptical but the proof is in the pudding, and here I sit before you... resplendently who I am,
One kick on your base will knock sense into you.<eos> Madam, I want to clear the air.<eos> I'm a straightforward guy. I speak from the heart.<eos> I've fallen in love with you.<eos> I want to marry you and once we're married... I'd like to call you Aarfa baby. Ok.
Luke's father was a politician back in Freetown.<eos> That's why he took politics.<eos> I used to say Sierra Leone is tugging on Luke's soul.<eos> You said Luke went... to give blood at the Sierra Leone Health Agency?<eos> Do you remember anyone from the agency contacting you?
You know, a lot of people in here are funny without meaning to be.<eos> I learned the hard way to hold my mirth.<eos> Oh, well, let your mirth fly free.<eos> I mean to be funny.<eos> Um... actually, I was wondering if I could speak to you about my friend.
Look there. Got my name on it.<eos> You think you're being goddamn funny?<eos> Well, I don't know, Sheriff. You do seem a little tense, you know?<eos> Well, you keep sassing me, ma'am, you're gonna see me tense.<eos> Hey. Hey, I'm talking to you.
Virginia Goodman's here because the prosecutor may be ahead of us.<eos> - The prosecutor...?<eos> - When will you be back?<eos> Tonight on the last flight.<eos> He wants to talk to you.
- The doors of the emergency chamber are blocked, jammed.<eos> You're not authorized into the mine! -<eos> - Do you have one of these?<eos> Eddie Geatki is extremely dangerous.<eos> Check Eddie's computer, I'm coming with you.
I do understand.<eos> This is a tough dilemma, but maybe we can work through it.<eos> I know I'm not allowed to see him yet, and you couldn't even get him my phone message, and... and I understand that.<eos> But I really need to see him, to know that he's okay.<eos> I'll ask Dr. Edwards if he can talk to you.
No, it seems to me you're on the verge of a breakthrough.<eos> Do you have any idea who this mystery person might be?<eos> You sense they were involved in your family's disappearance.<eos> I do.<eos> So why haven't they ever come in contact with you?
We should probably draft an appropriation in case we need to pay for a state funeral.<eos> - Doug.<eos> - Madam Secretary.<eos> I could've come to the White House.<eos> The organ network, it answers to you.
Ah, you must be exhausted.<eos> Now, sit. Sit.<eos> I imagine you'd rather be at the hospital.<eos> Well, this is too important, and you weren't going to negotiate with Secretary Durant.<eos> What makes you think I'll negotiate with you?
- Elliot Grote.<eos> You can't represent Castle when one of his victims was your former client.<eos> - Alleged victims.<eos> - All the same.<eos> Representing Grotto might have complicated matters, but then again, all evidence of our work with him and our deal with you seems to have disappeared from public record.
Me.<eos> And once again, Lucifer disappears.<eos> I think the case may have hit a little too close to home.<eos> Maybe things got a little too boring for Mr. Short Attention Span.<eos> I don't know. He's grown quite a bit since working with you.
I want you to know, Dennis, I will never stop fighting for you.<eos> My patients have become my family.<eos> They are what I've chosen instead of a more traditional path.<eos> I hope you feel you can be truly honest with me.<eos> I actually wanna be honest with you.
Sheffield Wednesday supporters.<eos> - They're listening to the game.<eos> - And bouncing!<eos> - And bouncing! - (baby laugh)<eos> You were in the teller's cage when a woman demanded to speak with you.
It's been a long couple of days.<eos> I'm... I'm sorry.<eos> Of course.<eos> No worries.<eos> Mrs. Said, I can reach you wherever it is you're staying and give you updates as I receive them.
- Donna Curtis.<eos> She's, uh, Petey's... Peter's biological mother.<eos> And now after all this time she wants to meet him?<eos> - Well, I'll be. - Yeah. As her attorney,<eos> The foster care records show that, uh, he lived with you, here, uh, until he went to juvie in 1988. Is that right?
- Jana!<eos> - If we let anyone out, we're risking the lives of everyone in this city.<eos> Don't worry, Miss Katie.<eos> I'm okay.<eos> Now I get to stay with you.
It's...<eos> She's just above, the bedroom on the right in the front of the house.<eos> Hello, Ms. Blum.<eos> My name is Lily.<eos> I'm going to be staying with you from now on. I hope that's all right.
Polly?<eos> No...<eos> My name is Lily, Ms. Blum.<eos> We met a few hours ago.<eos> I'm going to be staying here with you from now on.
Too scary for me.<eos> You know that one, don't you?<eos> Where did you go, Polly?<eos> I didn't go anywhere, Ms. Blum.<eos> I'm here with you, same as I have always been.
Well, better arrest him, then, eh, boss!<eos> I know.<eos> I've known the man 23 years, you feel like washing your mouth out, don't you?<eos> After you.<eos> These gentlemen need to talk to you.
Your poor friend. What a dreadful shock.<eos> Yes. Yes, it was a... Very unexpected.<eos> Impressive, Miss Havisham.<eos> Yes, you were, Amelia.<eos> Now, Mr Norton is keen to speak with you.
One day, perhaps.<eos> Bob told me that you've taken Mr Marley's ledger from the counting house hoping to find something.<eos> Seemed an obvious place to look.<eos> Though I recall Bob telling me that not all of Mr Marley's dealings were written down.<eos> Oh? Did he share any details with you?
Because I'm not here to interrogate anyone.<eos> I'm simply trying to get to the bottom of what happened in that apartment.<eos> No.<eos> I'm not formally representing my daughter.<eos> I wanted to speak candidly with you, Agent Harris, because frankly... I'm pissed.
Sir... you already done enough for me.<eos> Not really.<eos> I had no idea it was your son's shield number I was requesting.<eos> Well, there's no way you could've known.<eos> And my family is honored to share it with you.
- Was it because you had a relationship with that man? A relationship that ultimately failed?<eos> - That's not--<eos> - Relevant?<eos> It's more than goddamn relevant!<eos> Because when he broke up with you, you started this vicious rumor to get back at him.
Say something to somebody.<eos> Tell somebody what happened.<eos> Can't.<eos> I signed an agreement.<eos> I'm not even supposed to be talking to you.
In the meantime, why don't you pay a visit to the ob-gyn listed in Ellen's address book?<eos> If Mr. Jacobs is innocent, it might be the other man in Ellen's life who reacted negatively to the pregnancy.<eos> Her doctor may know his name.<eos> I'm sorry, but I don't see how I can help you.<eos> You were Ellen's doctor; she talked to you.
Mrs. Jacobs didn't come here to discuss paternity.<eos> She came here to have a successful pregnancy.<eos> Is that all?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> The Blue Cross people are back, and they're anxious to speak with you.
Could you do that?<eos> That would be basic.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Mrs. Izikoff, I'm Donna Rosewood.<eos> May I have a word with you in private?
Fair enough.<eos> He didn't do it.<eos> That may be, but he has no alibi.<eos> Because he was home sleeping.<eos> With you?
Is he here?<eos> No. Mnh-mnh.<eos> Is he out working a case?<eos> Oh, he didn't come home last night?<eos> I assumed he was with you.
We should be ready for a counter move.<eos> Agreed.<eos> Dr. Railly?<eos> To what purpose do you believe<eos> The Witness contacted you?
What's she talking about, major?<eos> She's talking out of her ass.<eos> Oh, so there isn't an advisory?<eos> That's classified.<eos> There's seriously something wrong with you, lady.
Yeah, serving the country.<eos> - I'm sorry about your mother. - Thank you.<eos> Oh, this is Monica.<eos> A pleasure to meet you, Madam President.<eos> My thoughts are so with you right now.
Hello, Madam President.<eos> - Or should I call you colleague now?<eos> - I wouldn't. And I just want to let you know that I, Congressman Jonah Ryan, will personally deliver you the vote that delivers you the presidency.<eos> - That means so much to me.<eos> - Ma'am, while I have you on the phone,
Woman: Is something wrong?<eos> Oh, it's, uh, just that I've never seen alonesomertown.<eos> Well, it's just that everyone's afraid to watch thecartwrightsdie.<eos> Man: Not everyone. That calendar there says someone'sbeencounting the days.<eos> MissSally,ma 'am,we 'dlike to talk to you fora minuteif we could.
Now, if you care to rest, the president and the teacher appear to be meditating.<eos> The idea was that the teacher was going to counsel Mr. Maxwell.<eos> We brought him in at your request, Madam Secretary.<eos> What happened after that is not up to us.<eos> President Shwe and Mr. Maxwell want to talk to you.
Nothing reported on any news source.<eos> The president is unharmed.<eos> Oh, thank God.<eos> What about Maxwell?<eos> Mr. Maxwell let his guard down as he spoke to you.
All you'll be able do is sit back and watch everyone around you die.<eos> But between Krypton and Mars, I guess that's old hat for you two.<eos> They're not gonna stop them, are they?<eos> Ma'am, it's Supergirl.<eos> She needs to talk to you.
You left that in the steam truck.<eos> Thought you might be missing it.<eos> It must be nice to be back here.<eos> You mind if I have a word with your ma in private?<eos> So, it seems like he's reconciled with you.
It must be nice to be back here.<eos> You mind if I have a word with your ma in private?<eos> So, it seems like he's reconciled with you.<eos> - It appears so.<eos> - Come around to you and Johnny, huh?
Hard to tell what he looks like now; it was fifteen years ago.<eos> We have met this man before.<eos> The florist, from the wedding.<eos> And the grieving widow's accomplice.<eos> How do you account for the fact that each of your husbands died after they married you?
In the proclamation, I am referred to as Alexandrina Victoria. But I do not like the name Alexandrina.<eos> From now on... I wish to be called... Victoria.<eos> Queen Victoria.<eos> This is Miss Skerrett.<eos> She is to work with you, Mrs Jenkins, as a dresser.
Okay.<eos> Feel better soon. Bye.<eos> Hello? Mrs. Parisi?<eos> I'm Amy Aly n.<eos> I don't mean to bother you, I was hoping to talk to you.
Yeah, he's as real as the fine I get when I use too much toilet paper.<eos> Wow, you really do have a lot on your plate.<eos> I do. You know,<eos> Leonard's right.<eos> Talking to you is really helping.
I need to keep the women active.<eos> Excuse me, Governor.<eos> Thank you, Smith.<eos> The Freak is asking to...<eos> Ferguson is asking to see you.
- Maxie's surgery.<eos> You know, they're keepin' us waitin' for a date and it's not fair.<eos> Um, so, can you ring the fucktards at the hospital or somethin'?<eos> It's not up to them.<eos> Right, well, can you talk to Miss Bennett?
We do.<eos> I didn't believe in miracles...<eos> What?<eos> What aren't you telling me?<eos> Since Nolan's been back, he hasn't contacted you, or anyone...
Explain the swing.<eos> Nolan used to sit on it with our parents.<eos> After they died, he'd spend hours out here, remembering.<eos> He must have come home because he missed it.<eos> If he came all this way to reminisce, why didn't he reach out to you?
"Raise your hand if you want Emil Bradford to die a slow, painful death."<eos> Oh. Booth, there she is.<eos> ...and we'll stay here till the Sherborne Hotel pays their female employees the same wage it pays the men.<eos> Leah Marino, FBI, Special Agent Seeley Booth.<eos> We need to talk to you.
Attagirl.<eos> The gallery is closed, Mr. Donovan.<eos> Can we talk?<eos> If you need something, speak to my attorney.<eos> - It has to be you.
Or are you based in New Jersey?<eos> You know, I should probably get some contact information from you.<eos> - Which is a nice idea, to be sure.<eos> Is Jeff going to be in the meeting? I know.<eos> It sounds complicated, but how it works is the commission will want to discuss this with you after they review.
Oh, what do you know-- a compliment.<eos> HPD just grabbed Fuller at the airport.<eos> They're bringing him in. All right, good.<eos> Mrs. Williams, on April 19, 2011, agents from the New Jersey field office paid you a visit.<eos> Your son Matthew had been on the run for months and the FBI wanted to know if he had made contact with you.
They gave me your name, said you were a regular, told me that you work this area.<eos> They treat me okay.<eos> They don't act like I got the plague or nothing.<eos> You brought the bottle to the park, and then you saw something that scared you, and you ran away.<eos> I don't want to talk to you anymore.
It's too-- too weird.<eos> Betty said you wanted to see me?<eos> I, uh, I wanted to talk to you about what happened in the lab this afternoon.<eos> With Mr. and Mrs. Connolly?<eos> With you, actually.
- to another department.<eos> - Well, that wasn't<eos> Captain Hicks; he wouldn't do that.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's why we need to talk to you.
Remember what we talked about.<eos> Stay calm, keep him talking.<eos> Hello?<eos> You've been very patient waiting for my call, Madam Secretary.<eos> As have the agents waiting with you.
You should leave Shepzoy now, ma'am.<eos> It would be best, for you and the baby, to get far, far away from here.<eos> It's not good for you here.<eos> I can't leave, Gwen.<eos> I'd go with you, you wouldn't have to be alone.
The justice system has determined who murdered Yesha Dargis.<eos> He's behind bars.<eos> Uh, Your Honor, the statement on the billboard is defensible in a defamation action as opinion.<eos> Those aren't two different defenses; those are two conflicting defenses.<eos> I'm afraid I have to agree with you.
Alice, look what I found.<eos> Don't you recognise it?<eos> You made it for me. Just before your 10th birthday.<eos> With your art teacher. Miss Hammond.<eos> Don't you mean Mrs Barker?
Likely being hunted by your clients right now.<eos> So arrest my clients.<eos> You're gonna help us find 'em.<eos> Even if I wanted to, which I don't, I'd be disbarred.<eos> We're not talking to you as counsel.
You're gonna help us find 'em.<eos> Even if I wanted to, which I don't, I'd be disbarred.<eos> We're not talking to you as counsel.<eos> We're talking to you as an accessory.<eos> You alibied Troy Spooner out the morning my daughter was attacked, said he was with you.
When will you return to America?<eos> You think I should be done with my husband hunting, then?<eos> Is it hunting or drag hunting?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> With you as the lure, I sense plenty of excitement in the chase, but no chance of a kill at the end of it.
Er, they're just my flatmates.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> So, Royal Commission, huh?<eos> Yes. Um, we wanted to talk to you and I thought, you know, rather than delivering a summons, it might be more friendly if I dropped by and invited you personally.
Be used against you in a court of law. Tell them that we were<eos> Not having sex. You have the right to an Attorney. If you cannot afford one, one will be appointed for you by the court.<eos> Okay, I am not saying anything until I speak to my Attorney.<eos> Put your clothes on, Miss.<eos> And I'm afraid your Attorney Won't be able to talk to you tonight.
What did Gene say to you about me?<eos> Gene is using you as an alibi.<eos> An alibi?<eos> For what?<eos> Over 30 years ago, Gene says he was with you on a night when we think he was robbing an ATM, and...
I asked Gene where he got it.<eos> He blew up.<eos> He pulled me across the table by my hair, and he told me to never ask him where he got anything again.<eos> Or I could end up dead.<eos> So, Gene Hecht was not with you the night of the murders?
Maybe this is a break.<eos> Captain, Jerry Vogel has asked to talk with us again.<eos> I just have one more question.<eos> Not to make things worse, but if you could tell me the name of Dwight's father so that...<eos> I really can't talk to you anymore.
It's nothing.<eos> Why wouldn't you tell me this?<eos> - Because it's nothing.<eos> - Mm-hmm. Wilson, are you following me?<eos> I'm with you today.
That's Lieutenant Reed.<eos> Eleanor's adjutant.<eos> Excuse me, gentlemen. Agent Tousignant, what are you doing here?<eos> Looking for Eleanor.<eos> I assumed she was still with you.
That was proven to be an accident.<eos> And this was a suicide...<eos> until it wasn't.<eos> I hear you're a Communist, too.<eos> I've got a few issues with you, actually.
It's big enough for both of us.<eos> Hello?<eos> This is Annalise.<eos> Hi, this is Candice from President Hargrove's office.<eos> She was hoping you had time to stop by today.
When Teri got home, she told you what she had done.<eos> She was ready to face the consequences and turn herself in, but you told her not to, that you would take care of everything.<eos> And you did, you made sure that Zoe Mercado was the one who tested the saliva on Marissa's body, and, like you expected, she matched it to Louis Bowman.<eos> You thought that was the end of it.<eos> But then, a few weeks ago, Phoebe Elliot contacted you.
Uh, right, tell her I need to reschedule.<eos> Like you did last week?<eos> Yes, Maggie, like I did last week.<eos> Ms. Rhodes, he's with a patient.<eos> He said he won't be able to make lunch today, but he'll call you back to reschedule.
You want to thank me?<eos> Find Mickey Doyle!<eos> I knew Henry was acting strange, but I just assumed it was because his father's deployment had been extended.<eos> I never could've imagined this.<eos> Henry's situation is why I wanted to talk to you alone.
Does that kind of incompetence come with a helmet?<eos> He has got to go.<eos> I know.<eos> I know.<eos> All right, that's why I wanted to talk to you.
I'll look into that.<eos> Not really.<eos> I don't care.<eos> Here's a copy of your schedule.<eos> And, uh, I just got word that Murphy Station would like to see you.
- Goodbye, Mr Brindsley.<eos> - It's been a pleasure to meet you, Mrs Leveson.<eos> And thank you for your hospitality.<eos> Words aren't enough.<eos> I'll walk with you to the bus stop.
All right.<eos> Sit... Sit down.<eos> Dr. Duncan can check you over tomorrow.<eos> If he agrees, fine.<eos> What about you?
I wrote it because it's the truth.<eos> I was wrong about you, Ms. Luthor.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Well, if I can make a believer out of Clark Kent, there's hope yet.<eos> What about you, Ms. Danvers?
How's that going?<eos> We're estranged.<eos> But not divorced.<eos> No.<eos> I've got to be honest with you, Ms. Bailey.
We got a couple of leads.<eos> You know, we're talking to people we think might've had a beef or two with Mr. Solloway.<eos> Yeah, and speaking of which, would you have any idea where your ex-husband was on Wednesday night?<eos> Cole?<eos> He wasn't with you, was he? No.
Okay. It's the same questions, just a different order.<eos> Great.<eos> And what is that order?<eos> Ms. Gilcrest, um... (clears throat)<eos> The principal asked to speak with you.
I think it's best to be direct.<eos> Were they? The paper suggested they were.<eos> Well, that's the newspapers.<eos> He says not.<eos> With your testimony that he was with you at 09:30...
Ram!<eos> I never found out what the F stood for.<eos> Francis.<eos> Miss Quill, I believe. Yes.<eos> I've been wanting to meet you.
So now you can finish your marathon shift.<eos> Go home, Dr. Rhodes.<eos> Put your feet up.<eos> Oh, actually I had something a little different in mind.<eos> What about you?
I'm...<eos> - Jet lag.<eos> Mr. President, Madam Secretary, pardon my interruption.<eos> Blake, what's up?<eos> Minister Chen is here and wants to see you immediately.
We're both stressed and tired, so I'm gonna choose to believe you didn't mean that.<eos> - Elizabeth, I...<eos> - No, I got to go.<eos> So, the pack was all over me about China at the briefing.<eos> But you'll be happy to know that the reporter I mentioned is quietly awaiting his one-on-one with you.
I'll be quick.<eos> Hello.<eos> Hi. Is that DI Wallis?<eos> Yeah, it's Constable Hartley, at Niddrie station.<eos> I've got someone in lockup here that says they want to talk to you.
Miss Hanover, yes, of course I remember you.<eos> You were his co-worker at the chemist's.<eos> That's right.<eos> I heard that the case has been reopened and I thought perhaps I might be needed...<eos> Oh, well, a new detective has taken over the Shanley case, but I'm sure he would be happy to hear from you.
- Who was she?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> She was distraught, but not enough to leave her name.<eos> Thank you, Mrs. Mclnnes.<eos> If there is anything else, I will contact you.
How is the investigation going?<eos> We are proceeding.<eos> Have you a suspect in mind?<eos> We have learned of certain events recently that have narrowed our search considerably.<eos> Which is why we need to speak to you.
Yes, tragic what happened.<eos> Mm. Please sit.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We, uh... we've been trying to understand it ourselves.<eos> Tell me something, did Detective Lau discuss any of the cases he was investigating with you?
Well, we primarily discussed his personal issues, his relationship with his ex-wife mostly.<eos> Hmm. Detective Lau was working three separate multiple homicides and getting nowhere fast.<eos> He never discussed those?<eos> Not to my recollection, no.<eos> I find it hard to believe that he wouldn't... share those frustrations with you.
You were gone.<eos> Why the fuck are you here?<eos> This fucking doctor... You think he would have done the things I've done for you?<eos> Ms. Patterson, I'm Detective Blackstone. I'm from the Oakland police department.<eos> Did Sergeant Moreno tell you why I wanted to talk to you today?
- Okay.<eos> I know that teenagers go through all manner of changes, but what bothers me is that Jim and I have always been close.<eos> I mean, I didn't think that we would ever keep secrets from each other.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I-I truly doubt he's keeping anything secret from you.
We have only a few reports from some travellers in the 1950's.<eos> Why for God's sake Hayri?<eos> Because it is the secret epicentre of the Arab world and I want to meet the emir Ibn Rashid.<eos> He is important He is the leader of Arabia.<eos> - Who would be with you?
I'm not a robot.<eos> What?<eos> I have feelings, just like everyone else.<eos> Would you like to talk about it?<eos> I'm not talking to you.
You have two unheard messages.<eos> First message.<eos> Hello, Miss Miles.<eos> It's Andrew McCabe again.<eos> You know, I'm not sure if you're getting any of these messages, but I still would like to speak to you about your late husband.
- What do you do?<eos> - Life insurance.<eos> A little late for that.<eos> For your husband, yes.<eos> But what about you?
Miss Kelly, might I talk to you later?
Poe, I need your help.<eos> PZ-4CO, report to communications.<eos> General Organa...<eos> I'm sorry to interrupt.<eos> This is Finn. - He needs to talk to you.
Go!<eos> Mrs. O'Dwyer...<eos> - Are you hurt?<eos> - I'm alive.<eos> Is Nick with you?
- Sophia Danko?<eos> - Yes. This is she.<eos> My name is Howie Sanders.<eos> I'm the attorney for Ira Levinson.<eos> I've been trying to reach you.
I know this is short notice.<eos> But it's important to know... he was very fond of you.<eos> I was very fond of him, too.<eos> Well, I'll send all the information along.<eos> It was nice to finally talk with you.
I wanted to thank you for not approaching me on that subject again.<eos> Well, it has not been easy.<eos> Do you wish me to, er, accompany you back to the house?<eos> No, I like to walk around the farm every night to make sure all is safe.<eos> Then I... I can walk with you.
Rehearsals.<eos> I sing bass in the choir.<eos> Yes, I've heard you.<eos> Then I apologize.<eos> I've been hoping to get a chance to talk to you.
Can I ask you a question too, Mrs Silver?<eos> ~ Yes, of course. ~ Will you marry me?<eos> That was very out of the blue.<eos> Yes. It... It...<eos> It's just that I've been meaning to ask you for some time, since the first time I saw you, in fact, when it was perfectly clear to me that you are the most... wonderful and beautiful person in the Western hemisphere.
Yes, but I just...<eos> I want to see if he's okay.<eos> I'm so sorry, but I can't give you any information unless you're a family member.<eos> Couldn't we maybe leave a number and you can contact us?<eos> If you leave me your number, I'll try and get someone to call you.
I can't keep it straight with these women.<eos> Thank God you're here!<eos> Ms. Campbell, Sergeant Carmen Sandoval.<eos> This is Lieutenant John Chestnut.<eos> Has Brian Nichols tried to contact you in any way?
- Any guesses?<eos> - I told you, I don't know.<eos> It's just that he might have divulged information without meaning to.<eos> Like I said, I don't know.<eos> Look, we're gonna leave these two officers here with you.
How was your relation with Dr. Sachin...?<eos> Doctor?<eos> He's one of my good friends.<eos> In fact, he's close to me.<eos> And to you, Mrs. Brinda?
If I were you, yeah, I would do that.<eos> A date with Alanis Morissette?<eos> What would I say?<eos> "Hello, Miss Morissette.<eos> What is it like to be you?"
Do I go to the hairdresser or not?<eos> Go.<eos> Could you prescribe some tranquilizers for me?<eos> I've got some here.<eos> It'd be good if this afternoon someone came with you.
'Trixie. I wasn't expecting to see you.<eos> 'I'm here to see Mrs Amos.<eos> Her husband's been arrested.'<eos> Mrs Amos, please sit down.<eos> Sergeant Noakes needs to speak to you.
It's just that I've got an intelligence briefing that I've got to get to, okay?<eos> Okay, you know what we should do is prioritize.<eos> -'Cause there's like the cutty and the spendy...<eos> Suckers.<eos> Hey, ma'am, I can't go in this intelligence briefing with you.
He photographs well for his age.<eos> Ma'am, the Apple Growers Association would like to name a new brand of apple after you.<eos> Is it a good apple?<eos> - It's a baking apple.<eos> - Fuck 'em. Oh, and Bill Ericsson wants to see you before you leave about Catherine.
I thought it might be useful to see how Doyle is performing as veep.<eos> I specifically promised Doyle that I would not do that, Kent.<eos> I apologize.<eos> But it did throw up some very interesting results.<eos> But I will run those by you at a less angry time.
I'm in Iran.<eos> Turns out you can't buy a boarding pass with tiny bottles of Jack Daniels.<eos> - Wow, that was great.<eos> - Wasn't it?<eos> - A lot of people need to talk to you.
Schnabelstedt.<eos> I was wondering if it's too late to order a vegetarian meal?<eos> I'll see what I can do.<eos> Schnabelstedt.<eos> And you're traveling with 8 children?
Good evening.<eos> - Come sit.<eos> - No, thanks.<eos> I'm tired.<eos> May I speak to you, ma'am?
I only wondered if they might not enjoy something a bit closer to home, with landscape that's more familiar to them.<eos> The Mahabarata, perhaps, or Tipu Sultan?<eos> Goodbye.<eos> I think I'll walk home.<eos> Miss Whelan... If you wouldn't mind some company, I'd be happy to walk part of the way with you.
Just put it on.<eos> Pleasure to finally meet you, Ms. Turbay.<eos> Sit down, please.<eos> I suppose you want me to interview you?<eos> No, even better. I'm going to interview you.
In the sure and certain hope of resurrection to eternal life, through our Lord Jesus Christ.<eos> Amen.<eos> It seems a waste for you to have come all this way, Stephen.<eos> Sir Walter wished you to be told in person.<eos> He wishes me to stay by you.
- Is he? Since he became reacquainted with you, I mean.<eos> Well... he has shaved his beard.<eos> Interestingly, I wasn't speaking of his facial hair.<eos> What then?<eos> More his... friendship with you.
Doyle.<eos> If this couldn't get back to Bill... I'd appreciate it.<eos> Ended nasty.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> - With you.
Can I help you with something?<eos> I'm actually looking for Chinaware.<eos> May I ask: where will you be living?<eos> Father's rented us a mews house in Mayfair.<eos> Oh. And Mr De Bolotoff - he isn't shopping with you today?
Should've been here two weeks ago.<eos> Looked like a big peanut.<eos> Is... Everything all right?<eos> Um... [ chuckles ] yeah.<eos> I'm just gonna get the images processed for the radiologist And, uh, she'll be able to discuss everything with you.
Is... Everything all right?<eos> Um... [ chuckles ] yeah.<eos> I'm just gonna get the images processed for the radiologist And, uh, she'll be able to discuss everything with you.<eos> But you'd tell us if something was wrong, right?<eos> You know, i'm not at liberty to read the images And discuss them with you.
Now see yourselves out.<eos> Yes, sir. Yeah.<eos> (clears throat) Maid: Thank you.<eos> Uh, excuse me, miss.<eos> Uh, can we talk to you for just a second?
I thought you should know that the coroner has officially ruled Tom's cause of death to be blunt-force trauma.<eos> And, also, we finally determined the exact make and model of the flashlight used to murder your son.<eos> It's marvelous what forensics can tell us.<eos> See, by taking a mold... of the bludgeoned area And matching it to a variety of makes and models, the criminologist...<eos> What the hell is wrong with you?
You saw a lie and you thought to yourself, "This cannot stand."<eos> You should be proud of yourself.<eos> Well, I am not.<eos> Then let me be proud of you.<eos> What happened to you, Miss Ayer?
Thank you for letting me know.<eos> So, who do you think will go up for Store Deputy?<eos> The store is open.<eos> This is no time to gossip.<eos> What about you?
I think you may be able to help him the way you helped me when I operated on the twins.<eos> Don't you think that the man would only be further upset by talking to someone who looks like me?<eos> The important thing will be the effect your words have on him.<eos> I mean, he doesn't have to see you at all.<eos> A gentleman wishes to speak with you, ma'am.
Winners and losers.<eos> I don't like that sort of business.<eos> Don't bet.<eos> If you think you can hoodwink me in order to take advantage of my girls, then you're very mistaken.<eos> I don't want anything to do with your girls, or you.
Daniel.<eos> You're one of the lucky ones.<eos> Well-armed for a mothball facility, wouldn't you say?<eos> Keep your eyes open.<eos> But I'm coming with you.
Ready to go?<eos> Yeah, but we got to stop at the police station on the way.<eos> Why? Do they know who killed Tom?<eos> Not yet, but there's something I have to tell the detective.<eos> - What is wrong with you?
Thank you all for attending today. Thank you.<eos> How on earth are we going to fulfil such a promise?<eos> We'll find a way, Mr Crabb.<eos> We always do.<eos> I need to talk to you.
Well, it's a war.<eos> Nixon declared it.<eos> The war on cancer.<eos> As long as it's not a war on me.<eos> No, no, it's not a war against you.
I see.<eos> Well, I came down here because I wanted to help, but now I'm wondering if I should have an attorney present.<eos> Our source is a private investigator.<eos> Zoe Blyer hired him to follow Dylan because she thought he might be having an affair.<eos> With you, actually.
It is my pleasure to inform you that your ex-husband and father to your children, Commander Zeke Tilson, has been found alive and well.<eos> He's being evac'd back to his ship as we speak.<eos> So he's okay?<eos> He's fine.<eos> And on a personal note, I want you to know, this whole experience has made me feel weirdly closer to you.
This friend of yours, what's her name?<eos> Hello, I'm Detective Figueroa. Beverly Hills police.<eos> Are you Genevieve Delatour? Yes.<eos> What this about?<eos> I need to speak to you about the murder of Louie Becker.
Going to the gym?<eos> Yep, I have my, uh, bag right here.<eos> You look so nice.<eos> Your hair is all done. You've got your makeup on.<eos> - So? - Well, if I were you, I wouldn't want to get all sweaty right now.
And instead of speculating about her, perhaps we need to discuss what we do right now, the next steps.<eos> Legally.<eos> Of course.<eos> The first thing we would do is drop a contract for services.<eos> I can talk to you about my fee schedule, which is very reasonable.
You're too damn ethical for that.<eos> They don't know me, do they, Cho? No.<eos> I think I do.<eos> And I'm gonna bet my son on it.<eos> Nice chatting with you, ma'am.
Take this guy.<eos> I mean, look, no offense, but you look like you've been taken to the cleaners several times.<eos> I've been wiped out.<eos> I'll be lucky if I can pay my kid's tuition... if I make it out of here.<eos> What about you, lady?
His trickle-down diplomacy is another example of delusion.<eos> Mrs. Underwood.<eos> Oh, you should go back inside with the volunteers and have the full campaign experience.<eos> I didn't come to New Hampshire for that.<eos> I came to speak with you.
Huh. Shouldn't have underestimated him.<eos> Seems like he had a plan.<eos> And speaking of plans...<eos> Mrs. Solano, let me get Diane.<eos> I know she wanted to speak to you directly.
And we do it at my place.<eos> No.<eos> I have some trauma training, but it's not my area of focus.<eos> I like you.<eos> Hey, I can talk to you. Please?
I'm quitting my job.<eos> Well, good luck.<eos> When they track you down, remember this.<eos> By taking orders without question, you've destroyed this town.<eos> You deserve what's coming to you.
There's a call for you, sir.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> You still want to take me in?<eos> No, that won't be necessary.<eos> A few hours alone with you under the lights -- that's more interesting than this party.
It's possible he's being held by somebody from that blood group of yours.<eos> I want their names.<eos> I don't know any names.<eos> It's an online community, and --<eos> I shouldn't even be talking to you.
Going down.<eos> Oh. You're Emma's mom, aren't you?<eos> I am.<eos> You know what?<eos> I'm gonna ride with you.
If he was thinking about going on vacation, believe me, it wasn't to that part of the world.<eos> I promise we'll try and find out what happened.<eos> Mrs. Boris...<eos> Um, I'm sorry.<eos> Has anybody from the press tried to contact you?
Alison? Your Honor, can you instruct the witness to answer the question?<eos> - _<eos> - Miss DiLaurentis, please answer Mr. Sirk's question.<eos> Counselor, would you please repeat the question for the witness?<eos> Lieutenant, I need to speak with you.
I'm saying there's no way for this to happen without somebody being killed.<eos> Madam Secretary?<eos> You have a visitor.<eos> They found him wandering outside the gates.<eos> Said he needed to talk to you, that it was urgent.
- He's here.<eos> The supervisor for Earth.<eos> You're killing scientific curiosity.<eos> Your scientific curiosity would've destroyed you.<eos> The supervisor would like to meet with you.
Thank you.<eos> How was your trip?<eos> Well, it was a lot of flying.<eos> But I'm glad I went.<eos> Uh, Admiral Hill asked to see you as soon as you got back.
What are you doing?<eos> I don't care whether you apprehend the kidnapper or not.<eos> Hello.<eos> - Boman speaking, ma'am.<eos> Niyaz wants to meet you.
It's a kind of chemical which is called Phencyclidine.<eos> Youngsters also call it Angel Dust.<eos> Drugs to youngsters.<eos> The one they use to get high?<eos> Your daughter Siya lived with you?
- in these murders.<eos> - What forensics exactly?<eos> It's serious enough that I'm making this call.<eos> It might behoove you if the League volunteered on their own to speak to the authorities.<eos> I am speaking to the authorities. I am speaking to you!
The gun dealer you spoke to described a man who had trouble walking.<eos> That could explain the uneven wear. Mmm.<eos> Gun dealer?<eos> Yeah, we thought we had a lead on where the weapon came from, but I sent the dealer the pictures we talked about.<eos> So, does anyone else live here with you?
I didn't do it.<eos> So, George, what about a drink?<eos> - You were in Toronto.<eos> - No flies on you, eh?<eos> - We were on the train together. - I also understand that Mr. Graham had recently parted ways with you.
There's something stuck inside.<eos> Will this do?<eos> That's why we aspire to a higher standard of purity... purity of thought,<eos> - purity of purpose. - Purity of race.<eos> Yes, which reminds me, Mayor, there is a new initiative that I wanted to share with you.
No.<eos> But I knew you were here because of the picture you posted of your bruschetta.<eos> This is completely inappropriate.<eos> And only jackasses say "brew-sketta."<eos> Just-just hear me out, I need to talk to you about Louis.
Oh, uh, uh, it's instant.<eos> It comes in a packet.<eos> Just add water.<eos> Uh, it's-it's like astronaut wine.<eos> And you're upset that this guy broke up with you?
And, oh, by the way, you are way too pretty for Alan. Oh.<eos> So are you.<eos> See?<eos> Now there's that smile.<eos> Come on, now, now... any guy would be lucky to be with you.
Okay, cut it out, both of you.<eos> NADINE: The desk officer is waiting to brief you on your first meeting.<eos> - Ecuador?<eos> - Yes, ma'am.<eos> And Matt and Daisy are here to have a word with you this morning.
While I was glad to do my part, the fact that we are now on the other side of a constitutional and global crisis is a testament to our president's courageous leadership.<eos> Madam Secretary, you were present when Iranian Foreign Minister Javani was killed, along with several others.<eos> Yeah. Yes, I was.<eos> Tell me about that horrifying scene.<eos> Who was there with you, and-and what happened?
Well, perhaps it's for the best, because clearly I have no option but to offer my resignation.<eos> What?<eos> You don't mean that.<eos> I'm sorry, my lord, but I cannot stay if I cannot perform my duties.<eos> I should have been more honest with you, my lady. Oh.
Please find my daughter.<eos> Ms. Langton, Vic will stay with you in case they try to contact you again.<eos> I'm not going back to the house.<eos> It's okay, Ms. Langton, you'll be safe.<eos> I'll be with you.
"Some men don't deserve to be walking the earth."<eos> Ma'am...<eos> We have to put you in lockup until we can get you in front of a judge.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I'd be happy to wait with you, if you want.
What she said.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Hello?<eos> She is at work.<eos> I'm actually here to see you.
La Fontaine de Mars.<eos> - You know Paris very well.<eos> - I love Paris.<eos> Oh, I really should go.<eos> My sister is going to be furious, but I want to meet with you afterwards.
And your partner.<eos> I am so sorry for your loss.<eos> I can imagine how difficult this week has been for you, but I promise you I am only here because<eos> I want to help find the person who killed your sister.<eos> I don't want to talk to you.
At least a dozen scattered over a block, maybe more.<eos> We'll work our way down the block.<eos> - You leap frog.<eos> - Yeah, copy that.<eos> Ma'am, you all right?
And yet you agreed to work with him.<eos> Well, he had intel. He said a girl was going to be taken, a general's daughter.<eos> We had to act.<eos> And since he would only talk to me...<eos> Only you?
She works on Wall Street.<eos> Go see her. She'll tell you.<eos> Ew. No, I'm not sleeping with Petros.<eos> Come on.<eos> So he wasn't with you last night?
Doc, you watch your language.<eos> I'm happy to help, Spencer, but this isn't what I do.<eos> You need to go talk to a psychologist. Why?<eos> I don't need a psychologist.<eos> I'm talking to you.
For our mother's day afternoon tea?<eos> Oh, you'll have to do that online.<eos> Oh, but can't you just do it?<eos> We don't take phone reservations.<eos> But I'm talking to you right now.
- The routine, Jimmy's routine.<eos> - I'll see what I can find.<eos> 'So please, please say, um, if you think it's a bad idea but I...' I just wanted to ask if you wanted to visit the site of Jimmy's grave.<eos> 'He was there for nearly 40 years.<eos> Now, of course he'll be coming home to you soon.'
And neither will you.<eos> Zero two, this is zero four.<eos> This is the Governor. The women want to speak to you.<eos> What do they want?<eos> They want to speak to you.
You keep me posted?<eos> Miss Jenny? Guns, knives, things that go boom.<eos> We're back in the demon-fighting business, we're gonna need 'em.<eos> We got the place surrounded, but he has four hostages.<eos> And he wants to talk to you.
If anyone can figure it out, my dad can. Mm.<eos> Good thing he's on this flight.<eos> You're lucky to have family like that.<eos> Yeah. I guess I am.<eos> What about you?
I'd be surprised if Mr Henderson was particularly anxious to renew our acquaintance.<eos> Couldn't Sir John Darnley put in a word?<eos> I'm sure, but the new owners won't take orders from him.<eos> Maddington is theirs now, they'll do as they think fit.<eos> So I'll tell Daisy not to speak to you about it.
I mean, I still have trouble comprehending emotional and social cues, but I... I think I'm getting better at it.<eos> You know, I owe Ed so much.<eos> I loved him like a father.<eos> Well, it's important for people like you to have a good support system of friends.<eos> And tell me about the young man who was with you here yesterday.
Oh, Cameron?<eos> Is he your boyfriend?<eos> Oh, no. No. He... he's nobody.<eos> Well, you're a very interesting case, Ms. Clark.<eos> Now if... if you're up for it, I'd like to begin some initial treatments with you today.
We met at the interview.<eos> About that...<eos> Yeah, I'm late for a meeting, Doctor.<eos> Enjoy your first day.<eos> That's what I wanted to talk to you... about.
I'm okay.<eos> People say I'm lucky.<eos> How's that?<eos> That I know what happened to her, where she went.<eos> Wow. You lose your mama and the very next day nobody gives a shit about her or you because they think the world is ending.
So it's sandwiches and coffee and work until dawn.<eos> - All right.<eos> - You're a darling. Thank you.<eos> Do telephone me if and when you're up in London again.<eos> No, I meant all right, I'll come with you.
I always think these things are such a waste, just ending up in a landfill somewhere.<eos> I recycle.<eos> So, Kalinda's gone from her apartment, her cell phone's off.<eos> No one seems to know where she is.<eos> And yet in court two days ago, you said Kalinda talked to you about your case.
No, come on in.<eos> I hate to return to old subjects, but, uh, Kalinda promised to meet with Mr. Bishop yesterday, and she never showed up.<eos> Do you know what happened?<eos> No.<eos> Well, has Kalinda been in touch with you?
Don't worry, we'll be back before you know it.<eos> What's Lady Mary's emergency?<eos> - It's none of our business.<eos> - Very true, Miss Baxter.<eos> For once I agree with you.
- Goodnight.<eos> - Your Ladyship.<eos> - Daisy?<eos> Yes, it's me.<eos> And I have to speak to you.
Janel feels like it could be worth further study.<eos> And since this is one of Mr. Van Owen's files,<eos> - perhaps he could help us try...<eos> - Excuse me, Dr. Tyler.<eos> I need to speak to you right away.
Unfortunately for this client,<eos> That's typical. She's has<eos> Quite a high tolerance.<eos> Oh?<eos> That why I'm talking to you and not her?
It sounds as if he has a good chance.<eos> Thank God.<eos> I'll find out if there's anything he needs in the morning.<eos> I'll walk down there now with some things for her ladyship.<eos> I'll come with you.
- Yeah, just what I said.<eos> - I've got butterflies.<eos> - Oh, don't be silly.<eos> I'll go over to check it all when they're in London.<eos> Oh, I'll come with you if you like.
- She can't do that!<eos> - No?<eos> Well, perhaps you'll pop up and tell her.<eos> - Save me packing.<eos> - What happens to you?
- How are you feeling?<eos> - I'm still shaken. I can't deny it.<eos> - Is your poor niece managing?<eos> - I'm going over to see her tomorrow.<eos> I'll come with you.
Which is hardly to be wondered at, when her only sister has wrecked her chances of a happy, fulfilling life.<eos> - Lord Hexham won't come round?<eos> - Lady Edith thinks not.<eos> And I'm sorry.<eos> What about you?
I would think a science scholarship would be the opportunity of a lifetime, you know, like the one Sara was offered.<eos> It was only a partial scholarship.<eos> I helped Sara realize there are surer bets in life.<eos> Like cheerleading, of course.<eos> Why didn't you identify yourself as Sara's mother when we questioned you at the arena?
Respectfully, ma'am, if there are money problems, maybe Joseph got involved with some illegal activity trying to help.<eos> Are there are any friends or girlfriend that we should be speaking to?<eos> No girlfriend.<eos> No anything.<eos> Joseph lives with you?
I don't know.<eos> Sergeant, back off, we got him.<eos> Back off.<eos> Turn around.<eos> - Ma'am, are you all right?
Can you save my spot?<eos> What I told you before, I was making shit up.<eos> Yeah. I figured that.<eos> Would you do this for any of the women?<eos> Ms Westfall. Bea Smith has requested to see you.
- Kid?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Not sure how he even ended up here, and they keep switching his room.<eos> You know, actually, maybe, uh...<eos> Maybe I'll come with you.
By the time he graduates, you won't even recognize him.<eos> That is, if he identifies a suspect.<eos> But if my son can't remember the man that he saw...<eos> Well, in that case, I'm afraid that we'd have no reason to send him to the academy.<eos> He'd stay here with you.
He is so brave.<eos> I shimmied out of the elevator... climbed up the cable... pried the doors open above us with my bare hands... and I found you help, but yeah... he's superman.<eos> And this is not our floor...<eos> Oh, look, Madame Paulette, I usually talk to my girl Scarlet over on Liberty Street...<eos> But both my friends said they met guys after seeing you.
I was just about to call you.<eos> Gary LaFramboise passed a half-hour ago.<eos> He's dead.<eos> What?<eos> Yeah, the nurse said he was conscious earlier, and that he spoke with you?
Well, what does that mean?<eos> Probably nothing, but I want you to see a specialist so we can rule out any chromosomal disorders.<eos> Her name is Dr. Simon.<eos> She's a perinatologist.<eos> Depending on what she sees, she may talk to you about doing an amnio.
Her name is Dr. Simon.<eos> She's a perinatologist.<eos> Depending on what she sees, she may talk to you about doing an amnio.<eos> Okay, so, um... When do I do this or what do I do?<eos> I'll give her a call, and she can hopefully see you today.
So I just don't have an employment history or previous addresses.<eos> Well, those are the requirements.<eos> Well, can't you just give me a break?<eos> No, I can't.<eos> Get your ex-husband to co-sign for you.
Well, at least now we have better whiskey.<eos> Now we have a better world.<eos> Ahem. Sieg heil.<eos> Miss Crain,<eos> Mr. Tagomi would like to talk with you privately.
- Ginny...<eos> - Please. Please, don't.<eos> We can deal with all of that once Henry is found.<eos> And the best way for us to help them do that is to stay calm and to stay here.<eos> Captain, may I speak to you, please?
I overheard you were a nurse. Yes.<eos> Yes, come in.<eos> She needs to lie down.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Can I talk to you for a moment?
Why aren't they saying anything?<eos> Your daughter is in the best of hands now.<eos> Linda is all I've got.<eos> You know you're going to have to be very strong.<eos> Come along. I'll wait with you.
All the men've been asking after you.<eos> Now you're telling tales.<eos> Been wondering when you're coming back to play the piano.<eos> Sure there are plenty of pianists in Sidney who can entertain the men equally well.<eos> But they're not you.
Are you asking me if Kate...<eos> We believe Kate smuggled the weapon into Paris that was used in the attack this morning.<eos> She wouldn't. Not Kate.<eos> What about this man?<eos> Has he contacted you lately?
- Ever.<eos> - As you wish.<eos> Also, what happens with me and my world stays with me and my world.<eos> Are you comfortable with that?<eos> If Your Highness is referring to the three or four ounces of cocaine on her vanity, the marijuana on her coffee table, or the excessive abundance of MDMA, my job is to protect you and secure your ability to pass safely to and from the palace, not to judge you, Your Highness.
Let me out!<eos> Let me out! Please!<eos> Let me out!<eos> - What do you want?<eos> - To speak to you.
She's free-muffin it at a baby school.<eos> Hi, Stewie. Mommy's here to pick you up.<eos> Why do you feel the need to narrate every little thing you do?<eos> Oh, hi, Mrs. Griffin.<eos> You know, I've actually been meaning to talk to you about Stewie.
He went to great lengths in order to help the needy.<eos> And so, every needy person will receive free help at Vikram Diwan Memorial Hospital.<eos> This is the first time when I feel I've managed to become somewhat like him.<eos> The News India crew is waiting.<eos> Ma'am, the News India crew is ready for the one-on-one interview with you.
No, ma'am.<eos> It's Ukrainian President Mikhail Bozek.<eos> His motorcade just drove up.<eos> What?<eos> He's requesting a meeting with you.
Why you got to be so hard?<eos> I am not being hard, but I do have expectations.<eos> Well, maybe your expectations are too high.<eos> Look, I don't think so, and neither should you.<eos> I'm not you.
Nothing.<eos> Oh. Nothing at all.<eos> Look, I know how hard it is to stand out in this world, make an impression, be great.<eos> I want to stand out.<eos> I do. But I'm-I'm not you.
- Thanks.<eos> - Tell you what.<eos> - Let's take the science lesson to Rosstree Field.<eos> - Great.<eos> I'll come with you.
Yes.<eos> Hi, uh, I hope I'm not bothering you.<eos> I don't... I don't have your number and...<eos> What can I help you with?<eos> I've actually been wanting to talk to you for a really long time.
You think you can make it right?<eos> You can't.<eos> Well, if that's the case, I'm sorry.<eos> You'll have to excuse me. I've got things to do.<eos> Denzil didn't believe in any church, so he wouldn't take kindly to me talking to you now.
How are you?<eos> Yeah, I'm great, actually.<eos> Good.<eos> Thank you, for the other day, I mean.<eos> It's been months since dad died and I've never talked to anybody like I talked to you.
- Dr. Kemps!<eos> - This is private property.<eos> - You must leave.<eos> - Detective Murdoch.<eos> - I need to speak with you.
Marco was not depressed.<eos> Your honor, where is the medical evidence?<eos> And that's why he killed himself.<eos> It wasn't because of my client.<eos> It was because he was a drunk who couldn't stand his life with you any longer.
She's also the one that got...<eos> May she rest in peace.<eos> I'm sorry, Ms. Franks.<eos> I appreciate you coming in.<eos> I have to ask if your husband has tried to contact you in the last 48 hours.
Deputy Blomfeld.<eos> You just missed the fun.<eos> Homeland just took the suspect to the medi-ship. - You can catch them.<eos> - I'm sure Glasser has a handle on it.<eos> Actually, I'm here to talk to you.
I just... I know you must miss him and worry about him.<eos> Like every soldier's wife.<eos> And I know the illness is a blow, but at least, you know, you have him home, and he's close, right?<eos> Thank you.<eos> The chairman is here to see you... Of the hospital.
Oh, it's so pretty!<eos> I'll make a list.<eos> Oh, excuse me, miss.<eos> Do you know the difference between a stool softener and a laxative?<eos> I'll be right with you, ma'am.
Please... ..you have to find out what happened to him...and who...<eos> Who what?<eos> Have you talked to the police?<eos> No, no, I can't.<eos> I want to talk to you.
The manner of death in this case was by homicidal violence.<eos> I told you at the beginning of this case that we would be presenting not only cause of death but manner of death.<eos> And when the jury has to put this whole puzzle together, the expert opinions by people like Leslie Eisenberg should all go a long way towards them making their final conclusion as to who it was who caused the death of Teresa Halbach.<eos> [Gahn] I would ask if Detective Wiegert would bring you exhibit 237.<eos> And can you identify that exhibit that's in front of you, Ms. Culhane?
Discarded tags, auto paint, paint thinner.<eos> Tyre tracks indicate we're looking for a Ford Econoline, white or blue body, long wheel base.<eos> Tell FBI we can be at the site in ten minutes.<eos> Dr Muller, there's a car to take you home.<eos> An agent will stay with you.
Dennetts on board. It's about time.<eos> Call it.<eos> My pleasure.<eos> Mrs. Murphy. You can come here as much as you want you can threaten me, you can sue me, you can take my home but I'm not going to stop until I see my husband.<eos> Do you understand that? Mr. Sellers would very much like to see you.
Your baby was taken on impulse. And this, this seems to be...<eos> She is a three-year-old biracial child with short, curly black hair.<eos> Brittany Lyme is, 'm fact, a dead finger h)!<eos> My daughter. And maybe she wouldn't be sitting here right now if these girls were smarter.<eos> Have they contacted you?
Don't tell me what it's called. They came up with a pretty good name, actually.<eos> "Seth's Seduction."<eos> Mr. Gilbert, it is so wonderful to have you here!<eos> Everybody's been dying to meet you in the flesh.<eos> -I beg your pardon? -He's teasing you.
I wish she was dead.<eos> I wish they were all dead and we were, too.<eos> Miss Everdeen.<eos> Colonel Boggs, District 13's head of security.<eos> I know you've been discharged, but President Coin's requested to meet with you first.
Thank you.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> He's not taking any visitors.<eos> Collier.<eos> I'm sorry, Miss Collier. He doesn't want to see you.
Now I'm at the station...<eos> And the cops are at the house, and it's serious and I'm calling you.<eos> There's a lot of things that are being juggled right now.<eos> I'm standing right next to detective Rhonda boney... Who's the lead investigator on this and she's...<eos> My mother-in-law would like to speak with you.
I'm Noelle Hawthorne. I'm Amy's best friend.<eos> Well, great.<eos> Where do you live, Noelle?<eos> Five doors down. 1032.<eos> Wonderful. I would love to talk to you.
Don't you mean "Did I hit him?"<eos> No, I don't. You know why?<eos> Because I wouldn't have missed.<eos> - Hey, hey, hey, take a powder!<eos> What is wrong with you?
State-sanctioned revenge is still revenge.<eos> So what part of the state is sanctioning you?<eos> I guess you could say I work for myself.<eos> Everybody answers to somebody.<eos> Unless they're you, of course.
I'll go this way.<eos> Fuck you.<eos> Everybody loves my baby.<eos> Everybody loves my baby.<eos> Ma'am, what's wrong with you?
OK. Yes. I mean, I can come today.<eos> Great. Great. Great.<eos> Great.<eos> Oh, my God. OK.<eos> Yes, I will see you there. I am so so looking... looking forward to meeting you, Ms. Whitfield.
If you were to be married to... the lady of your choosing, would it be necessary for everyone to know?<eos> If the ceremony were private, between the couple, who would be in a position to argue the outcome? They would be foolish to do so afterwards, when it was done.<eos> Yes.<eos> So much to contend.<eos> And what of you, Madame de Barra?
I caught sight of a pink dress and a pair of white stockings.<eos> I saw you walking among the roses.<eos> Yes.<eos> I fell in love.<eos> Oh, I wanted to talk to you. I-
Yes, for once, and for your own sake.<eos> The night is far gone. You"ve been drinking.<eos> You don"t know what you"re doing.<eos> I hear the crowd coming this way to look for me.<eos> I can"t be found here with you.
Come over here.<eos> Your hand in mine.<eos> I did not tell you, that time I saw you in the garden, I sat for hours on the wall, just looking at the house until the sun set.<eos> And then l-- you may despise me now, but I did what I never had dared to do before.<eos> I jumped down on the other side, hoping you"d come out again so that I could speak to you.
Oh, it"s so beautiful out there.<eos> The garden.<eos> I never showed you my little brook, did I?<eos> I know you"d love it, all my flowers.<eos> Miss Julie, I am going with you, but it has to be right now, right away.
- Did you see their eyes?<eos> - Maybe it's aliens!<eos> - Yeah, Dan, it's aliens!<eos> Look, guys, over here. Over here, over here!<eos> I'll stay right here with you, ma'am.
There's a woman from Solwal who wants to talk to you.<eos> Can't it wait until Monday at work?<eos> Today or tomorrow would be better.<eos> She says today or tomorrow.<eos> He wants to talk to you.
Get to work now.<eos> See you later.<eos> Mrs Bya?<eos> Yes?<eos> Mr Dumont would like to see you.
And he took his medicine and got better.<eos> Good boy.<eos> You're right.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Mr Aydin isn't with you?
There's still some left.<eos> If that is for our heroine Mrs Nihal who tries to ease her conscience by doling out charity to those less fortunate than her... then this money is just enough.<eos> You got the sums right.<eos> A truly kind thought, but... you forgot something, Mrs Nihal.<eos> The person in front of you is a filthy drunkard incapable of appreciating all your kindness.
I know I have.<eos> Oh, I'm sure.<eos> She's lovely.<eos> Yeah, I think so.<eos> What about you?
I didn't want to admit what a fool I'd been.<eos> So you're a coward too.<eos> If we lose Wyvern House because of you, Johnny...<eos> Good morning, Ms Thornfield.<eos> I'd like to talk to you about Valerian.
Well, I'm very flattered, young lady, but I find that hard to believe. I must have written no less than... 6,734 pages.<eos> I can recite them to you all by heart, if you wish.<eos> Are you one of Emily's friends?<eos> This sounds like one of her silly jokes.<eos> Is she there with you?
I think you're an old French fibber, Mrs. G.<eos> What went on between your father and me concerned nobody but us.<eos> We were discreet. We were cautious.<eos> We were considerate.<eos> I don't wish to cloud your delusions in any way, Mrs. G, but what went on between you and my father... concerned me and your daughter quite significantly.
We're taking her to the AE Department at St. Edward's.<eos> I-Is she going to be all right?<eos> We're doing everything that we can for her.<eos> And you need to make your way to the hospital as soon as possible.<eos> The police are probably gonna want to talk to you. Of course.
Yes.<eos> So, you were crazy about him.<eos> You were madly in love with him.<eos> You couldn't get enough of Sean McBride.<eos> You were devastated when he finished with you and you were angry... No.
How's the trial?<eos> Erm... not great.<eos> Why?<eos> This isn't about the trial.<eos> I've been trying to talk to you about this, but I didn't know how.
- Okay. - Just a second.<eos> What happened?<eos> This kid called me a faggot, so I, broke a yardstick on his face.<eos> Okay. Awesome.<eos> I'll go in with you.
Get him!<eos> - No, no, no, no. - David, what...<eos> What is happening, David?<eos> Who are those men?<eos> I really am sorry about this, Mrs. Peterson. I'm afraid I haven't been fully honest with you.
You guys ready for a special evening?<eos> Time to get dressed.<eos> Hello?<eos> Mrs. Beasley, I told you she can't come to the phone!<eos> What is the matter with you?
What?<eos> I thought she was with you.<eos> She was.<eos> She asked me to go into the brew and get some coffees And when I turned around she was gone.<eos> I need to talk to you.
It also shows the location of 4th Street Station, which DI Denton has claimed was the intended destination that night.<eos> DI Denton, this is now your opportunity to amend or clarify your previous statement.<eos> I've got nothing to add.<eos> DI Denton has nothing to add.<eos> There is one specific point we'd like to explore in more depth with you, and that is the route.
Seeing him. Seeing him with Carly Kirk?<eos> I saw Mike at the function.<eos> I didn't see Carly.<eos> No?<eos> Well, they're right in front of you.
Where?<eos> Edge Park Railway Station.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> When I worked with you, I saw first-hand how much it meant to you finding Carly.
Mrs Bligh...<eos> Shouldn't you at least wait until he's himself again?<eos> Being himself is precisely the problem.<eos> This is the treatment.<eos> This is what Dr Stewart discussed with you.
Excuse me.<eos> Do you need me to leave?<eos> I thought someone just come to...<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> I wanted to talk to you, if that's OK.
First, we'd be forced to seize your bank account and all your assets until the government gets reimbursed for the insurance money you received from your not-deceased husband.<eos> The fact is you knowingly participated in defrauding the United States government will probably result in some jail time, as well.<eos> Then we'd want to talk to your daughter, find out what she knows about Paul.<eos> Who knows? Maybe she's had some conversations with her father.<eos> Can we assume now that when Paul contacts you, you'll let us know?
If you so choose, you can still have a life together.<eos> He has another entire family.<eos> So, to understand, if you had remained ignorant of the existence of the other wife and children, you would still be deliriously happy?<eos> He's deceived me.<eos> Isn't it entirely possible that when he was with you, he was being completely sincere, and when he was with the other Mrs Dana, he was also sincere?
***<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm Special Agent Jack Crawford with the FBI.<eos> This is Agent Zeller and Agent Price.<eos> We'd like to speak with you about two of your former patients.
Because she listened to me.<eos> I'm not gonna let that happen again.<eos> Will, what have you done?<eos> Just what I had to do.<eos> What is it about you, Dr. Bloom?
Has that ever helped?<eos> Careful, yes.<eos> Vigilant, definitely.<eos> Leave the worry to your enemy.<eos> I will check in with you every day.
- I'll help you.<eos> - I'll come, too.<eos> I want to check on the condition of things.<eos> I'm sure my office is a shambles.<eos> Then I'll see Nurse Elkins gets home safely and I'll meet you there.
I guess we just kind of, uh, just kind of clicked...<eos> Me and Scarlett.<eos> Wow, you are very lucky.<eos> But I'm getting together songs right now for my next album pretty quickly, and I was just hoping that y'all wouldn't mind locking yourselves away for a few days, just to write some stuff, see what happens.<eos> Miss Clarkson, I'm thrilled that you wanna record our song, and I'm so grateful for this opportunity that you've given us to work with you. I just...
- Can you hear me? - Yes, I can.<eos> I can.<eos> Madam Vice President. it's such an honor.<eos> Thank you so, so much.<eos> You know, I really did want to speak with you first because I wanted to make sure that we got a little extra time to talk together.
The Veep wants you to be with her when she announces she's running for president.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - She's a really big fan of yours, Alicia. Yeah?<eos> You hear that?<eos> In fact, right now she is at her desk patiently waiting to speak with you.
- Officer Phineas Sears.<eos> - Well, this ain't me kitchen.<eos> I was just hired on in the last days.<eos> You need to speak with Miss Nisbet.<eos> Actually, we need to speak with you, Miss Mallon.
Any idea of why these payments would have gone up like this?<eos> I may be old, but I'm not stupid.<eos> I know when I am being accused of something, and if you think I had something to do with this, you are mistaken.<eos> We believe this is the work of a computer hacker.<eos> We're just trying to figure out what his connection to you might be.
Are you the girl in his book?<eos> Look, the book was sweet, but it doesn't mean it's based on anything.<eos> So if I asked around, nobody'd remember you two stepping out as teenagers?<eos> Maybe we dated a bit, but at that age, you date everyone, don't you?<eos> Did your dad put a stop to you and Shane like he did your sister and Campion?
I could have been on that.<eos> I could have slept through the whole thing.<eos> Where's my son?<eos> He's giving a witness statement.<eos> Is Jack wi' you? No.
It's where I belong.<eos> Mrs Johnson.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Mrs Johnson!<eos> I was wondering, uh, well, if I could speak to you.
I just need a couple minutes of your time.<eos> I have a few questions about Islamabad.<eos> I didn't know anything about it.<eos> You were a case officer there.<eos> What I mean is, I don't want to talk about it with you or anyone else.
Carla: Madam vice president, are you referring to the president's moral failings?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> Mr. President?<eos> I'm happy to discuss my marriage with you, madam vice president, if that's where you're trying to take this.
Look, I heard about your client, the fugitive lunch lady, and I think her story would make a terrific movie.<eos> I'd like to option her life rights.<eos> I can offer you 50 grand.<eos> I appreciate your interest, but the "son of Sam" law prohibits my client from profiting from her story.<eos> - What about you?
- Mrs. Desai?<eos> Yes, please come in.<eos> Can I get you anything to drink?<eos> Oh, thank you, no.<eos> If I could just speak with you and Daniel?
A clammy and intensely cold mist it made its slow way through the air in ripples that visibly followed... and overspread one another, as the waves of an unwholesome sea might do.<eos> It was dense enough to shut out everything from the light of the coach-lamps...<eos> I'm surprised you wanted to speak to me.<eos> I haven't been the biggest friend of the administration.<eos> Isn't that the very best reason to speak with you?
They've falsely charged you with misconduct.<eos> And it's not easy to mess with Mr. Salvi.<eos> To protect vested interests, the innocent are always blamed!<eos> They know you're new here.<eos> I'll come with you to Ratnagiri.
Any consistent patterns?<eos> Yeah, but I've never seen anything like it.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Excuse me, Agent Moreau?<eos> Chief Harris needs to speak to you.
I'd be much obliged if you could offer this young man a moment alone.<eos> We're gonna find her, son.<eos> My photographer and I were covering the honeymoon for Voulez.<eos> We were in the main room with the family when the captain sounded the alarm.<eos> And who was with you at that time?
I came to talk to you about Coral, ma'am. Coral?<eos> I... is she not coming today?<eos> Oh, no, no, I put her on the bus.<eos> I just came on ahead myself.<eos> I was hoping to have a word with you.
I thought it would be best if we kept our patients away from each other, unless you're going for stitches next time, Doctor.<eos> I don't think this is the right solution.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Obstetrics.<eos> Uh, Mrs. Johnson, it seems someone's trying to track you down.
I break some kind of law?<eos> It's really not necessary, officer.<eos> I know this gentleman.<eos> He's with me.<eos> What do you mean, "with you"?
The way... the way he looked at me, the way he called me "darlin"<eos> and told me I was "the one"<eos> but I never had sex with him.<eos> I resisted, and a month later, I was fired.<eos> What about you, Lee Anne?
Thank you.<eos> You're talking about losing Dan and Mike and Amy?<eos> - Plus Gary.<eos> - Oh, come on.<eos> Do you really want him standing behind you for the next eight years like an asshole?
No... Told, is more accurate that I must mention that you have a very exciting announcement to make.<eos> You know, it's funny.<eos> I really today wanted to talk with you and our group here about the big picture. You know?<eos> The American landscape that we're all in today.<eos> That's son of the conversation that I'm interested in having with you and with our friends.
Out of town on family business.<eos> Dr. Brennan, Dr. Hodgins, you remember Dr. Filmore?<eos> It's our favorite Canadian forensic podiatrist.<eos> Hello, Dr. Hodgins.<eos> Dr. Brennan, it's a pleasure to be working with you again.
Notes for my report.<eos> "Check American definition of 'cooperation.'"<eos> Dr. Filmore will be your intern so he can observe firsthand that our definition of cooperation is the same as our neighbors to the north.<eos> By his own admission, he's familiar with only 25% of the bones in the human body.<eos> Actually, I just completed my PhD in forensic anthropology, so I am now fully qualified to work with you... as a peer.
Mm-hmm. Damn it.<eos> Are you Leslie Shay?<eos> No, I'm...<eos> Leslie Shay, yeah.<eos> Ms. Shay, I've been trying to track you down this week because I'm the successor trustee for Darryl Bell, and you're the trust beneficiary.
- Haven't you heard of protection of sources?<eos> We know you're withholding information from the public good.<eos> You have evidence that your brother was guilty.<eos> We write to the Attorney General that there was no crime comitted.<eos> I need to have a word with you.
That's life.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - Maybe you sit up.<eos> Well, I'd really rather not.<eos> But it doesn't hurt you to sit up.
The kids put in there for your present.<eos> They brought this as my present. Ahjumma, come back soon.<eos> Man Se is killing me.<eos> Kids. They don't have much pocket money.<eos> Da Jeong, the physical therapist wants to see you. Yes, I'll be there.
But I think you are.<eos> You know, from now on, you speak to my lawyer.<eos> Sara's still waiting outside, you know.<eos> She's been sitting there for hours.<eos> He'll see you now.
He's just given me the iPad!<eos> Bring it back here, I'll do it now.<eos> Are you Mac?<eos> You can go through.<eos> Bloke said he'd meet you in the back.
Sean... ..don't think this changes anything.<eos> I need your car and a phone.<eos> And I want Lomax's address.<eos> If you can't give me Chambers, he will.<eos> Hello? Ma'am, I've got Sean Devlin here to see you.
_<eos> Oh. I don't mind.<eos> I'm sorry about Travis.<eos> _<eos> Has he ever talked to you about his parents?
I read your request, Ms. Knope, and I'm sorry, but we can't make that happen.<eos> Great.<eos> Well, this week just keeps getting better and better.<eos> Thank you for coming by and plunging a dagger into my already-bleeding corpse.<eos> I came here because I wanted to meet you.
Great.<eos> Well, this week just keeps getting better and better.<eos> Thank you for coming by and plunging a dagger into my already-bleeding corpse.<eos> I came here because I wanted to meet you.<eos> I've actually wanted to meet you since before you called me.
Well, then I'm gonna have to say that, uh, maybe this kid deserved it.<eos> Had it coming, you know?<eos> Hold on.<eos> It's never okay to hit another student.<eos> Uh... oh... I don't know if I agree with you.
I slept on the sofa.<eos> Why?<eos> We'd argued.<eos> What about?<eos> She told me she was coming in to see you, that she had already spoken to you once before, and she told me why.
No, it's gonna cost me $1,200 unless I qualify for a bereavement fare, which I don't.<eos> Is it a man or a woman?<eos> Um, a woman.<eos> I got this.<eos> My friend wants to talk to you real quick.
I just need a couple minutes of your time.<eos> I have a few questions about Islamabad.<eos> I don't know anything about it.<eos> You were a case officer there.<eos> What I mean is, I don't want to talk about it, with you or anyone else.
Thank you.<eos> You're welcome, Sister.<eos> You're proving such a help to me, Berwick.<eos> Sergeant, please excuse the informality of the surroundings.<eos> It's a privilege to talk to you anywhere, Sister.
Put me on live.<eos> I can speak to him directly.<eos> And I'm not so sure you're making a rational decision.<eos> This is an emotional ordeal, Ms. Matthews.<eos> Listen. I'm gonna do this with or without you.
You said there was a lot of competition.<eos> Sell it to one of the others.<eos> Yeah, well...<eos> There was no one else.<eos> I'm gonna be honest with you.
Right this way.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Anyway, they dragged her from here to there.<eos> Hello?<eos> I really need to talk to you about Claire.
Please.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Have Thea thank me, when she's back safe at home.<eos> Mr. Queen?<eos> I need to talk to you, it's about Mr. Wilson.
I'm gonna ask you to phone Mark.<eos> Now, I know this is tough, I do, but I need you to try to reach out to him.<eos> I don't know what to say to him.<eos> Just remind him that he's your son, you know, tell him that you love him.<eos> And that he has a future if he will just... let these people go and come home with you.
Please read her commendation.<eos> With me, Marshall.<eos> On with your work.<eos> Sir, might I have a moment?<eos> Ah, Sister Quayle, I was intending to speak to you.
What did you think it was going to be?<eos> Not this!<eos> Not a ghost with a head full of horrors.<eos> He would rather be dead in the mud with his men than at home with me.<eos> But he is coming home with you, you should be in there with him not out here.
Visiting time for tourists is from 5 to 7.<eos> You can join them.<eos> - Right, aunty.<eos> I mean.. your highness.<eos> Actually, I wanted to talk to you.
But... she died when she was only two years old.<eos> What?<eos> It was an accident at the playground.<eos> She fell off the slide and hit her head.<eos> [crying] I wanted to reach out to you then, but it was a closed adoption, so I had no way of finding out who you were.
You distil her, what do you find?<eos> Much of my life would be impossible, were it not for her commitment and support.<eos> In her heart, fundamentally Dr. Frayn, you say she is good?<eos> I do.<eos> You see, now I always would have agreed with you...
It seems he doesn't need you as much as you thought.<eos> Well, I'm glad he's making friends.<eos> Mother, your letters, they meant the world to me.<eos> I know.<eos> I beg your pardon, Mrs Greg, but may I speak to you about Patience Dunne?
You're living your fantasy, and it only took ten years of an apocalyptic war and the near destruction of the Earth's surface.<eos> Well, this is all very entertaining, if a little facile given that we've just met.<eos> Admit it, you like the world just the way it is.<eos> A playground for a man who'd rather not grow up than face the fact that this doesn't work for most everybody else.<eos> What about you, Captain?
Ah, you are from Chicago, so you like it!<eos> That's right, and we need passionate people like you on our national parks.<eos> You know, they get hundreds of millions of visitors each year.<eos> Are you nodding because you agree with me?<eos> Yes, I do agree with you.
Like it was about me.<eos> It wasn't about you, all right?<eos> Put that out of your head.<eos> See you later. Bye.<eos> Well, it's been a pleasure talking to you.
Does that come in English?<eos> Christopher Collins sustained pressure to the carotid artery-- cuts off oxygen to the brain, resulting in respiratory arrest.<eos> Are you saying Collins was choked to death?<eos> Yep. You got an old-fashioned homicide on your hands.<eos> I advised Officer Cutter. He has no obligation to talk to you.
You guys pay more.<eos> Eh, I guess he wanted to know what it was like to work in the big city.<eos> Well... now he knows.<eos> Kara, thank you for meeting me.<eos> My lawyer told me not to talk to you again.
It'll kill the woman.<eos> Unless she doesn't hear it.<eos> I can't lie to that woman again.<eos> Commissioner Reagan.<eos> I need to talk to you, Mrs. Tomlin.
~ Because you don't want to.<eos> I would only say that I am not that person now.<eos> When you've finished your tea, we can walk the terraces, if you like.<eos> That sounds ideal.<eos> I recently read a book on the science of quarantine and I've been looking forward to discussing it with you.
Look, Archie, I'm...<eos> Camel rides now, is it?<eos> I'm surprised you're not charging.<eos> I'm taking this down, for a start.<eos> That's nothing to do with you, you can't touch that!
..they just keep coming.<eos> She'd have given that thumbs up.<eos> Residential home.<eos> I didn't want to say this... only it's been bugging me.<eos> She thought the world of you.
Clear.<eos> Maintenance tunnels.<eos> They run all over the school. I need you to take me to the storage closet in Doc Reid's office.<eos> Carrie: Let's go.<eos> You want me to go down there with you?
Why?<eos> People are complex.<eos> Maybe he had a breakdown or a personal crisis.<eos> And maybe there's a secret side to the man That nobody knows.<eos> Including you.
Wrong apartment!<eos> I think you're Olivia Pope.<eos> Ms. Pope, that was me calling your home phone.<eos> I have my boss on my cell.<eos> She really needs to talk to you.
Dinner.<eos> You and me.<eos> And the faster you type, the faster you get your reward.<eos> Mrs. Taylor.<eos> You claim that your best friend Marjorie spoke to you about divorcing Max nearly a year ago.
I don't know how I'll ever repay you...<eos> - This way.<eos> - I didn't know what to do.<eos> I've never needed a lawyer before.<eos> I was so grateful that Cheryl offered to put me in touch with you.
Uh, it's about your husband.<eos> You've got five seconds.<eos> Trust me--you don't want to have this conversation on your front stoop.<eos> Time's up.<eos> Your husband is really good at keeping secrets, especially from you.
He's great. And they're the only team in that area that can effect this rescue.<eos> We need opinions on this, State, D.O.D.<eos> What's next?<eos> Well, it's not in the book, but I have been asked to update you on general Abu Said Khan, Syrian intel chief.<eos> Khan would like a meeting with you.
How would you possibly know that?<eos> Family resemblance.<eos> Mrs. Browning, if you're lying, You could be arrested for obstruction of justice.<eos> I'm gonna ask you one more time --<eos> Was your husband with you at the opera?
He's been beefing up our domestic security initiative, since you made it rain at Pierson's fund-raiser.<eos> - Then I'll be there.<eos> - Wheels up at 0400.<eos> We're taking one of the jets.<eos> A DNI investigator has put in a request to discuss the Chicago event with you.
When do the tenants go?<eos> Next week in theory.<eos> I need to pull the real pictures out of storage.<eos> What a palaver! I know, but think of the relief when I can shut the door at last and be alone in my own home.<eos> Won't Lord Flintshire be with you?
She must've come in under a different name.<eos> The question is why?<eos> Fine, I used a friend's I.D. who caters at the Filmont to get into the event.<eos> Dave O'Bannon's phone records indicate seven incoming calls all from an unknown burner cell.<eos> Do you want to save us the time of linking that phone to you?
Okay, an ambulance will be there shortly.<eos> There's so much blood!<eos> They're on their way, miss.<eos> - What should... what should I do?<eos> - I'm gonna stay with you til they get there.
The acceptance rate for refugees is less than 40%.<eos> You call Immigration, you take away any chance that these men may have at a new beginning.<eos> And you have no idea who they were working for?<eos> I'm sorry, no.<eos> I think that's all for now, so if we have any more questions, we'll get in touch with you.
He said, "Don't be a fool.<eos> You're gonna die here."<eos> - Dr. McCord.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Hey, can I talk to you about my thesis?
I've just been waiting for one of them to step up and say that they are willing to tell me the truth.<eos> And now one of them has.<eos> And I expect to have a very enlightening conversation with her tomorrow.<eos> I just thought you might want to know.<eos> Which one wants to talk to you?
Once more I ask you, is everything all right?<eos> Tell me, madam. Are you here by your own choice?<eos> I appreciate your concern, Lieutenant, and I can assure you I am a guest of the Clan MacKenzie.<eos> As you wish.<eos> Nevertheless, I am certain my commander will wish to speak with you.
Wait, wait, wait.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Just, um, could you please tell us if you recognize this writing?<eos> Your husband reached out to us.<eos> - Did he ever talk to you about his work?
- Did he ever talk to you about his work?<eos> - No.<eos> Mostly baseball and Dungeons Dragons.<eos> Dungeons Dragons?<eos> He never talked to you about anything else?
It's a ledger.<eos> I hid it right before they grabbed me.<eos> I need for you to go get that now.<eos> Your husband reached out to us.<eos> Did he ever talk to you about his work?
What's the... what's the nearest border crossing?<eos> Well, there's a... there's an ag crossing a couple of miles from here.<eos> Save yourself a lot of trouble at the border if you got one of these things on your vehicle.<eos> You know, I got this guy at Customs...<eos> Good, uh... good working with you again, Detective.
All right. Just wondering.<eos> Let's write it. You publish it.<eos> Eleanor: This is good.<eos> Thank you, cesar.<eos> You want me to go with you?
You don't know what that's like.<eos> Actually, I do.<eos> And it's bullshit.<eos> Last one today.<eos> Not critical, but insisted on seeing you.
Anyway, um, I'm Dr. Alver.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Oh, yeah, I'm fine.<eos> Can you... can you just scoot down a little bit, please?<eos> Um, did you... did you bring anyone with you?
I'm Sara's brother. Did...<eos> did you arrest Keith?<eos> This your son?<eos> Yes, that's David.<eos> It's probably best if David waits outside with Theresa while we speak with you and your brother.
Sure.<eos> Come on.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> I'm Lieutenant Beth davis.<eos> Who's at home with you, mrs. Santos?
Excellent. A wild goose chase.<eos> I'd like to think of it more as a scavenger hunt.<eos> Where's your partner?<eos> Um, re-interviewing suspects on a case.<eos> How is that working out for you?
He is the fruit of my loom.<eos> I think you mean loin.<eos> Fine.<eos> What else could you possibly need to know?<eos> Uh, an address we can verify to prove that he lived with you.
Because that's what we do.<eos> Damn right.<eos> So, you woke up when you heard Mr. Ross yell your name.<eos> And you saw the intruder...<eos> White male, medium build... standing over you with a knife.
Are you an agitator, Mrs Middleton?<eos> I don't understand what you mean, when...<eos> How much time have you been spending with Bill Gibby, Mrs Middleton?<eos> I think you went to the factory this morning to agitate with Gibby and have come here primed to agitate some more.<eos> Is Gibby with you now?
You'll be named as co-respondent.<eos> Heavens.<eos> Unexpected.<eos> He has the necessary witnesses.<eos> But if you're prepared to testify about your relationship with Lady Jane, the trial could be over very quickly.
Mrs Hallows...<eos> Then why are you taking him from me?<eos> Haven't you got enough? Haven't you got enough?<eos> Josh, what have you told her?<eos> I want to come with you, Lady Jane. What?
I don't know.<eos> Didn't he love her?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, he loved her very much.<eos> What about you?
Sibling powers, activate.<eos> Let's go.<eos> - Hey!<eos> - Hi! Hi.<eos> Well, I have a surprise for you. Oh, I have two surprises for you.
It might even be a little boring.<eos> Well, I hope so.<eos> Makes my job easier. This is your blue badge.<eos> You can only speak to other blue badges.<eos> If a person with another color badge Tries to interact with you, Please report it to security immediately.
I didn't know what to do next, and I suppose Cousin Peter felt sorry for me.<eos> - No burning ambitions?<eos> - Not really.<eos> I'm always jealous of those chaps who fly the Channel, invent a cure or something.<eos> What about you?
Department of Justice?<eos> This is an order from the Executive Branch for a forensic audit of this facility and all employees.<eos> So, what are they looking for?<eos> Ammunition to bring down Hetty-- they need a sacrificial lamb.<eos> I will check in with you every day.
I think I can do something with it.<eos> Where's my husband's body? Here.<eos> With our medical examiner.<eos> When can I see him?<eos> I'll have Dr. Mallard contact you when he's through.
- Well, i hope so.<eos> Makes my job easier.<eos> - This is your blue badge.<eos> You can only speak to other blue badges.<eos> If a person with another colour badge Tries to interact with you, Please report it to security immediately.
Hearsay. 804 exception, Your Honor.<eos> Declarant is unavailable.<eos> Mrs. Toms' husband is deceased.<eos> - That doesn't make any difference.<eos> - Wait. Wait. Mrs. Toms, did Mr. Keller ever discuss with you directly why he stopped buying seeds?
You want to hear what happened afterwards, right?<eos> Yes, after court.<eos> The state's attorney met with me.<eos> I see.<eos> Was Cary Agos with you?
Yes, she has.<eos> Mrs. Florrick.<eos> Yes, that's it.<eos> I know you don't pray, not yet.<eos> But I want to pray with you.
Just me.<eos> No family?<eos> That's the best thing about this job... having a pack you belong to.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Craig said I should speak to you about your science programme?
Going after her would raise the killer's infamy to new heights.<eos> She's the next victim.<eos> Tatiana Fisher.<eos> NYPD.<eos> We've been trying to get ahold of you and Cam Magani.
Please, please tell me it isn't true.<eos> It-it's a joke, right?<eos> I mean, they're messing with me?<eos> They've got to be messing with me.<eos> Slow down, who's messing with you?
The tissue.<eos> I'll tell Booth we may be looking for a sexual predator.<eos> Dr. Brennan.<eos> Yes, Mr. Vaziri.<eos> I don't want you to think I told Cam to talk to you.
I don't know. I was just...<eos> I was just grateful that I made it home alive.<eos> - I'm still shaking.<eos> - Okay, okay.<eos> When did Lydia and her boyfriend first contact you?
This is a stimulant, a mood enhancer and an aphrodisiac-- what?<eos> ! -- all rolled into one.<eos> And then I put it in my morning smoothie. What's up?<eos> I-I think you're gonna need a bigger knife.<eos> I understand, Madam Secretary, but Sam Hanna is an agent of the highest order and I have cooperated with you fully.
Well, there was one guy, a sleaze bag lawyer who used to come here looking for clients.<eos> He was always bringing the Mikorskis papers to sign, confusing them.<eos> You got a name on that lawyer?<eos> I may have his card in my office.<eos> Oh, I'll go with you.
Hi. My name is Hailey Rutledge.<eos> I'll be sitting in with your section today.<eos> I'm an oboist.<eos> Yeah. I mean, obviously I'm an oboist.<eos> I just wanted to say it is such an honor to get to play with you.
Well, let's see what happens if I bridge the circuit.<eos> All right, you ready?<eos> And that's what turns an accident into murder.<eos> I'm so sorry, Ms. Mason.<eos> These officers want to have a word with you.
You always have a choice.<eos> And you chose wrong.<eos> Twice.<eos> You still waiting for something?<eos> Haven't they finished with you yet?
And then when the buyer realized it was a fake, they killed him.<eos> If we're right, the buyer may still be looking for the real map, which was last in your family's possession.<eos> Are you saying that I'm in danger?<eos> I'm saying you should keep your eyes open.<eos> If you see anything out of the ordinary or if anyone tries to contact you, you should call us.
Henry is.<eos> He thinks that you attacked him because he rejected you.<eos> That fat-ass. Where were you last night?<eos> I was here, working.<eos> Was anyone with you?
- who's always touchy.<eos> - How did this happen?<eos> Did no one see this coming?<eos> Manny may have opened up to me about his sexuality, and I may have said something about hypocrisy.<eos> Madam Secretary... the president would like to meet with you and your chief of staff.
- ♪ and filigree ♪ - Hi, Daphne.<eos> ♪ He said every snowflake's different ♪ Bay is not here. She just left.<eos> - You might be able to catch...<eos> - It's okay.<eos> I came to see you.
Let's hope he's not a cop, too.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> What does birding have to do with staying off drugs?<eos> Not a clue.<eos> That's why I contacted you.
Yeah, well, I used to drink, and I also did a shitload of other stuff, but..<eos> Tonight was actually.. It was the first time that I wanted to use again.<eos> I'm glad you're here.<eos> Uh, Miss Burke? Edwina Burke from Evergreen Academy?<eos> Yes. I was wondering if I could talk to you about a former student?
I'm not afraid of you or your evil kind.<eos> God our creator will condemn you to hellfire along with terrorists, atheists, homosexuals, democrats, liberals, socialists...<eos> Greenpeace and all the other unnatural abominations.<eos> My dear Mrs. Lincoln.<eos> If i were you, i would welcome any kind of fire.
Hospitals fascinate me. - Doors opening.<eos> - Are you being serious? When I visit hospitals, I get excited because I feel like I can make a contribution.<eos> Well, perhaps I can show you around.<eos> I would adore that.<eos> I don't know how to contact you.
- Please. Please?<eos> - One moment.<eos> The last ferry to the city leaves in ten minutes.<eos> This gentleman will escort you outside.<eos> I cannot be seen leaving with you. But I will see you out there. Do you understand?
- He's my intern.<eos> - You have an intern?<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> Hello, Dr. Foster.<eos> It's such a great honor to be working with you.
Not particularly.<eos> Scandalous.<eos> I am sure you have escorted many a fine lady on to the dance floor.<eos> I would say that manners maketh man.<eos> I look forward to having the pleasure of standing opposite you.
I told you already, that was before.<eos> On a bearskin. You told the other officer it was a bed.<eos> No, it was a bearskin on the floor.<eos> What the fuck is he trying to do?<eos> How many times did you say he had intercourse with you?
Oh, come, madame.<eos> But what use am I to anybody?<eos> Oh, to step into the Great Unknown - and then John would be free.<eos> I'll fetch your malted milk.<eos> I will come with you.
It's pig meat.<eos> I'll bring more when I can.<eos> I can get you out.<eos> People know your books.<eos> They will take care of you.
Dr. Korczak, my car is outside the gate.<eos> It's just outside, just there.<eos> It's impossible.<eos> I need your help now, or the fear will be unmanageable.<eos> God bless you, Dr. Zabiński.
good morning sir, Welcome to Williamsburg Savings Bank.<eos> Let me give you a call, We will arrange an interview for you With a bank employee. Once someone is available.
Called "Lo and Order" They solve crimes faster than you.<eos> You should see it.<eos> In the real world, It takes longer to solve crimes From an hour-long series.<eos> I think that's all, Mr. Harding.<eos> If we protest any additional information, We'll call you.
Let me jump in here. Mr. Riley, let me introduce myself. I'm Brian Sweeney Deputy Chief of Mission United States Embassy.<eos> - We're on the case, okay?<eos> - Look, I know the detective personally. He's a good man, he's been around the block.<eos> Let's let him find the fisherman, all right?<eos> But in the meantime I need every available resource out there searching for your family and that includes you.
That sort of thing.<eos> In return, however, she requires treats.<eos> Last year, it was a violin.<eos> This year?<eos> Five minutes unsupervised conversation... with you.
No. That's black.<eos> Like I was saying, itit's real tough to see the color at night, so...<eos> There it is. There's your door right there, Mr. Jones.<eos> Mr. Jones? Mr. Jones? Mr. Jones.<eos> All right. All right. I'll wait right here with you.
Well... we appreciate you coming down, Bushnell.<eos> Well, I really appreciate your help.<eos> Damn strange business.<eos> First his car blows up, and then somebody tries to kill him.<eos> We'll get back to you as soon as we have something.
I don't want a hospital.<eos> - Mr. Radovan... - I...<eos> I want my daughter.<eos> Danny's taking care of that.<eos> Right now, we need to take care of you.
Thank you.<eos> Did the plane arrive early?<eos> I mean, are they here already?<eos> I don't have all the information so I don't want to tell you anything that might not be true.<eos> Somebody will be right in to speak with you.
Our proposal will be exactly the same.<eos> James.<eos> Mr. melnyk, this is the framework agreement we're proposing to the families.<eos> I would like to just...<eos> It's a friendly agreement between you and the airline in which you agree to withdraw all claims and lawsuits from the company.
Look, do you mind? I've got a shot to make.<eos> So make it.<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> My name is George Chichester.<eos> And when you have taken your shot, I'd like to talk to you.
After a successful stint running the secretive special operations killing machine in Iraq,<eos> Glen was appointed leader of US and coalition forces in Afghanistan.<eos> A war which, as he saw it, wasn't being won 'cause it wasn't being led.<eos> General.<eos> We're all very excited to have you here. It's an honor to meet you.
It's a real privilege.<eos> - Rolling Stone?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> Just make sure I'm on the cover.<eos> Well, it's between you and Lady Gaga, sir.
Please sit here.<eos> Please, please sit. Sit.<eos> - How are you?<eos> - I'm fine, sir.<eos> I've been trying to contact you.
Okay. Let's go, Willy.<eos> Fall out.<eos> - Do you need anything, boss?<eos> - No. Thank you, Willy.<eos> Are you... are you sure you don't need me to come with you?
Every road that leads to Burma now has a British post.<eos> Not even a bird could fly over to this side now.<eos> Ah Sergeant Malik!<eos> At ease.<eos> Mr. Billimoria wanted to see you.
But it's what you do next that counts.<eos> Not what happens... but what you decide to do about it.<eos> Please, my wife. I was on the phone with my wife.<eos> Where's my phone?<eos> Sir, stay calm. We're gonna take care of you.
I'm gonna miss this cast.<eos> Yet you never asked to sign it.<eos> - Bye. - Bye.<eos> Hey, Chief.<eos> A guy just came in and says he needs to talk to you.
Pardon?<eos> Ni hao is the Chinese.<eos> The Corsicans use the simple salut.<eos> And guten Tag, if German's your thing.<eos> Is that... Are they with you?
Now, this woman has been telling us since she hit the campaign trail two years ago--<eos> "Don't over-react," and here she is, not even following her own advice.<eos> And what I'm wondering-- would you fight for her, General?<eos> I fight for my country.<eos> Well, I am with you there.
- You don't have any what?<eos> You don't have any balls?<eos> What?<eos> !<eos> Sorry to interrupt, Mr. President, but the vice president is here and she's demanding to speak to you.
The terrorists you tried to help her hunt down, they've abducted Senator John Donovan.<eos> Now Rebecca intends to surrender herself to the terrorists in exchange for her husband's life.<eos> How do you know this?<eos> We intercepted a fragment of a phone call she had with Jadalla Bin-Khalid.<eos> Has Rebecca tried contacting you at all?
Resume.<eos> _<eos> Senator...<eos> Your father is here.<eos> He wants to see you.
Not long, I don't believe.<eos> She rarely included me in her thinking.<eos> What I knew of her was mostly observed rather than shared.<eos> But one thing I know to be true... whatever risk she took... or danger she braved... they were all made out of love for you.<eos> She saw a life with you and the child... and she was determined to deliver you all into it.
What is it?<eos> We need more supplies. We found him amongst prisoners in the interior.<eos> I mean, the wars are our priorities. A ringleader of the pirate militia.<eos> He surrendered himself.<eos> Said he would only speak with you directly.
They're with the Securities and Fraud division.<eos> And this is your warrant.<eos> Just come with us peacefully, or I will cuff you in front of all these people, including those reporters, okay?<eos> That won't be necessary, Detective.<eos> I'll come with you.
I'm here in an official capacity.<eos> Not seen much of you since the Wessex raid.<eos> When are you gonna give me the inside story?<eos> I'm sure you've spoken to everybody else.<eos> All bar you and Inspector Thursday's daughter.
In 30 years, over 100 people have lived here, thanks to generous countries like Russia, the USA, and China.<eos> We call this Tranquility Node.<eos> Dr. Jordan here is about to break the record for consecutive days in space.<eos> Four hundred and seventy-three, straight.<eos> Your mommy must miss you. - (LAUGHS)
We were just going for a walk, and he fell.<eos> You were exerting him, weren't you? No, I didn't.<eos> It's gonna be okay, Mr. Hudmore.<eos> It's gonna be okay.<eos> We're gonna take care of you.
Like a Renaissance pope, I absolve you.<eos> You may sit. You have something to say to the man.<eos> Ahem.<eos> Technology's evolving. We're all evolving.<eos> It would be an honor, sir, to evolve with you.
But it was murder that sent you to Arkham, a prison for the criminally insane.<eos> I rescued the city from the madman, Theo Galavan.<eos> Some call it murder. Others a public service.<eos> And after your controversial release from prison, you met your father, Elijah Van Dahl.<eos> A man whose identity your mother kept from you. My God.
I dropped them a couple of streets from the church.<eos> - You were working all night?<eos> - Till three.<eos> The graveyard shift.<eos> So, we were talking to your radio controller. She said you developed a fault with your radio halfway through the night and she couldn't contact you.
- Why not?<eos> I promised I'd keep their name out of it.<eos> Have you forgotten what's happening? Your wife was raped.<eos> We're trying to find the person responsible.<eos> What's the matter with you?
You think I...<eos> Jughead.<eos> A kid like you, raised on the wrong side of the tracks by a deadbeat dad, bullied by kids like Jason Blossom.<eos> Who wouldn't want to lash out at that?<eos> I'm not talking to you anymore.
Inside.<eos> And, Sergeant...<eos> One more thing.<eos> Mrs Clark? I'll be on my way now.<eos> Actually, I did want to see you about something.
It's the smoke.<eos> Try not to panic. Slow, deep breaths.<eos> Arthur Pilbury and George Marsh -- they're still in there.<eos> Oh, Lord, no.<eos> I'm coming with you.
Oh, Lord, no.<eos> I'm coming with you.<eos> Look, the fire's only just out.<eos> The bloody wiring must've caused this. It'll still be dangerous.<eos> I'm coming with you.
There's no furniture in the place.<eos> Doesn't look like she ever moved in.<eos> You've got to be kidding me.<eos> What, do you think she ripped me off?<eos> That's between you and her.
I'd hate to ruin those hands.<eos> Amanda. I told her to be out front.<eos> It's fine, I'll get her.<eos> Wait, wait, wait.<eos> I... I need to talk to you.
About your father and that whore.<eos> I can't do all this on my own.<eos> I need you, for once in your bloody life, to be a son to me. Help me.<eos> Please, I need your help.<eos> I'm glad you're here, there were some things I wanted to discuss with you.
Uh, last night.<eos> Um, I went to see her at the lab around 11:00.<eos> Seems a little late for a visit.<eos> I needed her help on a project, and I couldn't sleep, so, well, I went to see her.<eos> Was she working on the project with you?
Whoa! It's okay.<eos> He's a Grimm, but he's a friend.<eos> - A Grimm?<eos> That's better.<eos> He just wants to talk to you.
- What?<eos> Were you talking to Mrs. Stanton?<eos> Yes, do you know her?<eos> She's been a customer forever.<eos> - We should go with you.
Close the door. Dr. Latham, I'm not sure how much of that.<eos> You heard back there.<eos> I believe most of it. If I said anything that may have offended you, I'm sorry...<eos> I was only trying...<eos> There's something I should share with you.
- How's she doing?<eos> - Which one?<eos> Grace, Becca?<eos> Who knows?<eos> Mr. Scott, if there's a part of Grace that she didn't feel comfortable sharing with you before, is it not at all possible to see anything that's happened here as a sign of progress?
They need you.<eos> Mr. Kellogg, I'm very sorry.<eos> We are gonna take excellent care of you, but you're gonna have to wait a little bit longer.<eos> - For God's sake.<eos> - I will be right back, and I'm gonna make you one of our first priorities.
Though I would be interested to hear what Mr. Foley has to say.<eos> Let's meet back at the hotel later and I'll tell you all about it.<eos> I will. I will.<eos> I said I will.<eos> He wants to talk to you now.
Let's meet back at the hotel later and I'll tell you all about it.<eos> I will. I will.<eos> I said I will.<eos> He wants to talk to you now.<eos> I'd much prefer to speak with you, Mr. Foley.
He wants to talk to you now.<eos> I'd much prefer to speak with you, Mr. Foley.<eos> You see I don't believe in demonic possession.<eos> Nor do I think you're insane.<eos> He doesn't want to talk to you now!
Veronica, did this man hurt you in any way?<eos> No, he was nice.<eos> He said we were playing hide and seek.<eos> Did he say who you were hiding from?<eos> You.
Pity.<eos> I'm glad you came.<eos> - Jane, there's something...<eos> - Yes?<eos> Sir, someone wants to see you. Says it's urgent.
Yeah, I think you're going to like this.<eos> A gentleman's come in.<eos> Says he's got a problem with vermin in his basement.<eos> Sir?<eos> It was John Bentley who approached you?
Hey. I checked around the building. She's not on the grounds.<eos> Your mom's been doing really well.<eos> She'll be okay.<eos> Yeah, well, she couldn't have gone far but I'll drive around, take a look around.<eos> I'm coming with you.
For you. I hope that's fine.<eos> Jacques rigaud.<eos> No one is to interrogate him before he's sent to berlin. How did you secure him so quickly?<eos> Some informants are best kept quiet.<eos> I am honoured to have worked with you.
- And were you there the whole time?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - You didn't go outside at any point? - No.<eos> I didn't go outside at any point.<eos> Yes, only we've got these time-coded photos of you at the party.
That's guilt.<eos> That's wrong.<eos> That lad knew it was wrong, Mr Holland.<eos> He was ashamed of his old man.<eos> And I believe he approached you, to tell you that.
But it's important that we let the committee do its job.<eos> So thanks for your call, Annie.<eos> Arthur Capo from Del Rey Beach, Hawaii.<eos> Arthur, how you doing?<eos> Why did they want to talk to you?
Was it to discuss that prior incident?<eos> Come on, James.<eos> You can do this.<eos> Mr. Nava?<eos> Did Bianchi say why he wanted to speak to you in private?
That donor's blood is only of value to you and only if you receive it soon, which means it's in their interest as well as ours to resolve this quickly.<eos> We just need to demonstrate those facts.<eos> You make it sound so simple.<eos> Well, negotiations are rarely simple, but in this case the facts are.<eos> Um, can... can I speak with you for a minute?
- The past five.<eos> - Must've been tough.<eos> Especially when she spread the word about your affair.<eos> With a dental hygienist named Todd.<eos> Thanks to Cheryl's gossiping, your wife found out about Todd, then divorced you and took your kids to Virginia Beach.
We'll cover this side.<eos> Wait for my signal.<eos> Move!<eos> Come on.<eos> We're right behind you.
Dude, I've searched everywhere for any trace that any of Banneker's work might've survived that fire.<eos> Yeah, I've been working these black market channels for a long time, and the good news is, the buyer lives here in D.C.<eos> The folio sold for a small fortune to tech billionaire Malcolm Dreyfuss.<eos> Mr. Dreyfuss, a word.<eos> A Department of Homeland Security officer is here to see you, and she has Ichabod Crane in tow.
Well, it worked.<eos> W-We're sitting here.<eos> It was an insult.<eos> 'Cause Senator Vang says he has no idea what this is about.<eos> I was hoping a face-to-face with you might help me jog his memory.
View never gets old, does it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I-I haven't been here that long yet.<eos> Indeed.<eos> I can't tell you how special it is to finally meet you face-to-face.
Thank you, sir.<eos> I know you've got a Senate vote coming up fast, so I won't take much of your time.<eos> What I came to tell you is, with the proper encouragement, I think a few moderate Republicans in the Senate might just vote yes.<eos> What kind of encouragement are we talking about?<eos> If the Senate gets the bill to the House, I will work with you and other House leaders to get an amended measure passed, as you intend.
No, we'll talk later.<eos> Kimble, please, have a seat.<eos> Did you speak with the committee?<eos> Unofficially.<eos> And I wanted to speak to you as soon as possible.
Be well.<eos> Take care.<eos> Bye.<eos> Mr. Novak.<eos> Sorry to just, you know, barge in like this, but I really need to talk to you.
I assume you've met.<eos> Not before today.<eos> But her poetry has stirred the cockles of my heart.<eos> You're quite the cockle-tease.<eos> I have been warned about you, Mr. Henderson.
Are you on the lam? !<eos> Alex. I can help you, but, I mean, I have kids here.<eos> Stop it.<eos> I went down there. I talked to the D.A.<eos> I have to advise you, Dr. Karev, that talking to you without your lawyer present just isn't...
Are you her ex-lover?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - I'm sorry, I can't hear you.<eos> Yes.<eos> And did she break up with you?
Yes.<eos> And did she break up with you?<eos> I would guess it was... mutual.<eos> You would guess.<eos> Since you're in a guessing mode, would you also guess that your whole testimony is an attempt by you to get back at the woman who broke up with you?
You're a Bernie Bro? Okay.<eos> We really don't need to go there.<eos> We agree on the ends, that's what matters.<eos> I supported Trump because I thought the world would be more fun.<eos> You supported Trump because, what?
Not the best I can do.<eos> Well, it'd better be, or it'll be the last thing you do.<eos> Now, Garcia is a matter for the FBI now, not NCIS.<eos> If we can find a way to prosecute him, we will, but you're not to go after him on your own.<eos> I don't answer to you.
While we wait on our sketches, I've got another one of the first class passengers coming to the station later, you free?<eos> I'm not.<eos> I'm going to a party with my boyfriend, and I absolutely can't miss it.<eos> So, Mr. Edsall...<eos> Ms. Kupps met with you about the Paris flight?
Jay and Erin.<eos> Kevin, you're with Adam.<eos> Al, you got Burgess.<eos> Okay.<eos> It's good to be working with you, Detective... or Al.
Well, the U.S. position on the referendum is one of neutrality.<eos> As I trust China's will be, as well.<eos> I am not the one accepting gifts from the Mongolians.<eos> Well, that makes two of us.<eos> Always a pleasure talking to you.
It is a pleasure!<eos> - Man, have I heard about you.<eos> - Where's Wyatt?<eos> You're supposed to be so fast with a Colt you've been banned from every shooting contest in the plains!<eos> It is a rare challenge to face against you, sir.
Write that down.<eos> I apologize, Mr. Booth.<eos> - Your story's just been corroborated.<eos> - By who?<eos> Someone who needs to speak with you immediately.
Well, Mr. Callen, I've reviewed the charges.<eos> Honestly, I don't think they have much of a case.<eos> So I've prepared a statement for you.<eos> Please feel free to look it over while I get you the hell out of here.<eos> Agent Morgan, I'd like to speak with you and your SAC.
Oh, that's right.<eos> You have a gun.<eos> Glock 17, 9mm?<eos> I'm not gonna play this game with you.<eos> "I'm not gonna play this game with you, Sir."
- Oh, don't threaten me, Ms. Davis.<eos> I don't threaten.<eos> I just try to remain as clear as possible.<eos> You offered me your services, and I offered you mine.<eos> You know... I was here before you and I'll be here after you.
I'm sure there are things he wanted to tell me but couldn't.<eos> He was about to go public.<eos> He was gonna embarrass a lot of people, including his friends, destroy careers, maybe.<eos> So, that's why you arrested Mike and Jake?<eos> This secret the Navy kept from you...
Do you know when it's gonna happen, sir?<eos> Ronnie thinks it's gonna come out in the next few days.<eos> Here we go!<eos> All right! Whoo!<eos> Governor Whitfield, you'll be up first, and I'll be right behind you.
I'll feel your breath against my skin.<eos> And I kiss you.<eos> The two of us.<eos> Forever.<eos> Monsieur Legate. My employer would like a word with you.
We've got work to do.<eos> And after this, find Al-Khatib and continue your cleanup.<eos> It's been going very well so far.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> Those of us who are left are behind you 100 percent.
We're done here.<eos> And if you tell anyone who I am, you're gonna have more than one Capone to worry about.<eos> Did you know that he takes ads out in newspapers, looking for you?<eos> All over the country, for years.<eos> He misses you.
- Course not.<eos> - Why not?<eos> He did business with a gang leader.<eos> Or what about the plumber that fixes his pipes?<eos> Or what about you? And Detective Kim?
Do I look disappointed?<eos> No.<eos> No, you look angry.<eos> Mr. Holmes?<eos> Mr. Garber will see you now.
Who the hell are you?<eos> How did you get in here?<eos> You can't be here.<eos> Dr. Krilov, I'm a friend of a friend.<eos> I'd like to discuss a proposal with you.
Never to East Rutherford Laboratories.<eos> You were giving him a discount and pocketing the payments yourself.<eos> No, that's not true.<eos> We also went through Fred's phone records yesterday.<eos> He talked to you six times last week.
Sorry to stop by unannounced like this, but your address is in our files.<eos> If you're looking for an update on the investigation of Fred Kirby's murder, I'm afraid I can't help you.<eos> There have been some developments, but they need to remain confidential.<eos> I don't want an update.<eos> I'm here to talk to you, detective to detective.
Kennedy was more outgoing.<eos> More self-assured.<eos> Dismissive of authority.<eos> Always ready to argue.<eos> - With you?
I think I need to speak with a lawyer.<eos> That's one option.<eos> Or you could realize that we're throwing you a lifeline.<eos> Grab it.<eos> When the connection between you and Roy comes up, you will be charged with falsely reporting an incident.
On behalf of the cricket guys, that's yours.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Play for Australia one day, eh? - Yeah. Yeah.<eos> And for the next eight years, Oliver just lived for cricket.<eos> He went from the fresh-faced kid we see there, to the brink of the national team with you in his corner every step of the way.
Hey, you up for a meal, Clay?<eos> Yeah, sounds good, Ravi.<eos> He went from the fresh-faced kid we see there to the brink of the national team with you in his corner every step of the way.
I just... had a good feeling.<eos> A good feeling you shared.<eos> Your phone records indicate a considerable increase in international calls the week before the match.<eos> I was just ringing friends to say hello.<eos> That wide was part of a scam people all over the world bet on, and all of those people, including you, lost a lot of money.
They're with the Securities and Fraud division.<eos> And this is your warrant.<eos> Just come with us peacefully, or I will cuff you in front of all these people, including those reporters, okay?<eos> That won't be necessary, Detective.<eos> I'll come with you.
On three, okay?<eos> One, two, three.<eos> We've got a flail chest.<eos> Okay, Sir, my name is Dr. Alexander. Dr. Diaz.<eos> And we're gonna take care of you.
Yeah?<eos> Thanks.<eos> We're square.<eos> How is she?<eos> I'll be honest with you, Sir.
It's all thanks to you, Mr. Sakurai.<eos> I haven't done a thing.<eos> You put up with me.<eos> When my works didn't sell, and when I couldn't write.<eos> I wasn't putting up with you.
Then, can you imagine who might have killed her?<eos> It wasn't me.<eos> I mean, who would do such a thing?<eos> How did a murderer get inside?<eos> Did you know Nanaka Hiraki before she lived with you?
"Because I love novels."<eos> If that's the case, then why don't you just write a diary.<eos> Mr. Michima, don't underestimate the power of expression.<eos> Isn't that why your novels never sold?<eos> They're only selling now because of the scandals surrounding you.
There you are, my beautiful nieces.<eos> Oh!<eos> Please join us, Mr. wickham.<eos> No. Duty calls, I'm afraid.<eos> Um... I must know, Mr. wickham, what is amiss between you and Mr. Darcy?
Calvin, here, thought you were The Black Badger.<eos> I don't... No, I don't think...<eos> When we were in the plane, you said, "Hey, Harris is the Black..."<eos> I think you should... Maybe I...<eos> Mr. Joyner, it was a pleasure working with you.
Get in the car.<eos> They're waiting for you.<eos> Does my wife know where I'm going?<eos> Only they know.<eos> From this moment on, I won't have any more contact with you.
good morning, Mr. Jimmy.<eos> All of a sudden, just like that?<eos> Thank you, Captain.<eos> Damn! The god damn phones still don't work, Mike.<eos> Hey, I flew in with you, Mr. Jimmy.
Where is my son?<eos> - Did he get off the rig?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> My son, do you know him?<eos> Did he leave with you?
- Don't put your hands on me.<eos> - Andre?<eos> It's okay.<eos> - That's, that's...<eos> - Diane Lester. I'll be happy to talk to you.
- Kiss?<eos> - Oh no!<eos> The Grand Clock!<eos> - Wilkins!<eos> - Right behind you sir..
Elder Wheeler will be interested in what I have to say.<eos> No...<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm wanting to talk to you specifically about a Commandment that's in the Bible...
Come on, let's move, go, go!<eos> We have done everything we can, captain.<eos> Just turn on your beacon.<eos> - Scotty, you have everyone?<eos> - Aye, sir. Everyone except you and Jayla.
My name is Detective Miller, Saratoga Springs Police Department.<eos> I'm afraid we have something we need to talk to you about.<eos> You okay, Mr. Stackhouse?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm afraid I still need to go through a few things with you.
- Everyone I know always says...<eos> - That's fine.<eos> Thank you, Mr. De Vries.<eos> You can go now.<eos> So. Mr. De Vries says he spoke to you at Harry's Rainbow Grill.
Doubt is everything.<eos> You should know that.<eos> I'll keep this safe. Until I hear from you.<eos> Detective Corby!<eos> I need to talk to you.
Gentlemen, this is a very great honour, indeed.<eos> I'm only a foot soldier but here I am, addressing the generals!<eos> It seems quite plausible to suggest that these remarkable paintings, which mainly represent animals not seen in the region since the last Ice Age, these masterpieces date from the same period.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I take my hat off to you, Professor Vilanova.
The fuck is wrong with you?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Mr. Wren?<eos> This is Waldon Campbell from Mr. Hobbs' office.<eos> He'd like to meet with you immediately.
I'm grateful to you for returning to London.<eos> Do please take a seat.<eos> I'm intrigued to know why you've brought me all this way.<eos> The government summoned me here last week upon receipt of the Harragin report.<eos> They have reviewed it and considered the conflict between you and your uncle.
We'll be back. Let's go.<eos> Good evening, sir.<eos> Come in.<eos> We asked him why he made the video.<eos> He says he'll talk only to you.
It's my turn to be polite now.<eos> This, sir, is nonsense.<eos> Where were you between 10 and 10.30 this morning?<eos> - I was at home.<eos> - And who were you with?
We'll have snipers cover the exterior.<eos> Snipers? We don't need snipers.<eos> I've got the cash.<eos> Let's do this civilly and quietly.<eos> I'm right behind you.
Surely, you can...<eos> Surely, you can now tell me something about Merry.<eos> - I surely cannot.<eos> - I would like to speak with her.<eos> Well, she wouldn't like to speak with you.
Come in.<eos> We're going to lose this war.<eos> You were over there a long time?<eos> A few months.<eos> The young man just now, was he with you?
We'll go stay in a hotel or something.<eos> We'll get room service.<eos> Mr. March.<eos> Mrs. Glenn.<eos> I need to talk to you.
Maybe you know exactly where those ships came from.<eos> Maybe I have no idea.<eos> It's a pretty big boat you're building out there.<eos> A small fleet of stealth ships wouldn't be impossible.<eos> I'm not going to debate with you.
You are something, man.<eos> You create a bunch of chaos, you stir shit up so you can ride in and save the day, right?<eos> You have no idea how close we are, huh?<eos> I am talking about independence! Yeah.<eos> With you as governor.
Feels great being so rude to a noble lady.<eos> What's with her?<eos> Why does she stomp her feet, expressing her anger, sit up in the middle of the night and sigh?<eos> Åíery time she sees the Count, her eyes seem to say...<eos> I despise you.
Absolutely, Titus. Absolutely.<eos> But it is a very interesting proposal anyway.<eos> At the end of this month, we should have all calculations done.<eos> Sorry, but I think we cannot promise anything as long as the cooperation with Buzau won't work better.<eos> That's why I would like to discuss with you, Mr. Dascalu how we can improve our cooperation with Mr. Iliescu.
I've had it better.<eos> I'm gonna go for that. My limousine is waiting.<eos> Very nice to meet you.<eos> Sorry, just one moment.<eos> My husband has a headhunting company here. If there's anything we can do to help you or Mr. Tiriac, we'd be very happy to.
You know, there's something any experienced detective knows, and it's something I've personally witnessed hundreds of times in the last 30 years.<eos> Christian, Jew, Muslim, what have you.<eos> There's an immense sense of relief when they finally just let go and tell someone the truth.<eos> It's like... finding God.<eos> I'm not talking to you anymore.
Okay, now.<eos> He's licking his lips.<eos> He's licking his lips!<eos> Uncle Arthur! Frank, pull yourself together!<eos> Behind you, sir, behind you!
Miss winters is a foreign agent.<eos> Miss winters, a spy?<eos> She can't be. She's a woman.<eos> I shall go and break the news to her at Sully point.<eos> I'm coming with you.
How did he die?<eos> Oh, it says here that his body was found in the river by the property.<eos> It was ruled suicide.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I'll have a real estate associate meet you out there.
You better shut up, or I will cut your color-struck ass.<eos> Call me that again.<eos> Uh, Mr. Stokes?<eos> Spit it out.<eos> There's... There's a detective here to see you.
Good morning, Miss Brooks.<eos> How are you this morning?<eos> Oh, well, we have a cook.<eos> He's black, he makes grits with secrets... and he's hanging out in our kitchen.<eos> So, what kind of a deal did Richard make with you?
Right now.. Pablo's contract is really important.<eos> Otherwise.. I'll be spending the rest of my life.. ...in the same office, on the same post.<eos> So true.<eos> I bought a new phone. - Wow.<eos> Akash sir, if you don't mind can I take a selfie with you?
I've to talk to the boss and get this contract back.<eos> Yes, but the boss isn't talking to anyone.<eos> There's one way.<eos> Sir!<eos> Please, sir. I want to talk to you.
A woman.<eos> Who I love.<eos> And I got close.<eos> In the bleak midwinter...<eos> At some point in the near future Mr Churchill will want to speak to you in person, Mr Shelby.
Massa, please.<eos> My daughter, Massa.<eos> Sure about Samson?<eos> Who we gonna get to break the African boy?<eos> Need to speak to you about that, sir.
Yeah? Then came your curious fucking gyppo question.<eos> I won't ask, but, um...<eos> Here's a list of the men who would buy a Faberge because of their wives' obsession.<eos> Oh, yes. Thank you, Mr Shelby.<eos> Lovely doing business with you.
Just teach me how to shoot.<eos> It's easy, Michael.<eos> Just point... pull the trigger.<eos> He asked for me today, Mary... .. not his mother... .. for the first time.<eos> He missed you.
It won't.<eos> We're on to you.<eos> Bad guys come in and monsters come out.<eos> Just like Pinewood, right?<eos> Seeing as how you no longer work for the police department, I'm not required to speak with you,
Oh, great, pity food.<eos> Thank you anyway, but I can cook for myself.<eos> Wow, I would roll my eyes so hard right now if it didn't make my brain burn.<eos> Okay, Captain, this ends now.<eos> I know your pride is hurt, but no one ever took pity on you.
Do you want to know why the amazing Captain Holt has never gotten the evidence room cleaned or done anything on your list?<eos> Why?<eos> Because all day long, he's putting out fires.<eos> That's what a captain does.<eos> The only difference between you and Holt is that he lacks the strength to close a door so hard a room blows up.
It was amazing.<eos> What?<eos> The band, Nasty Bits.<eos> Yeah, right. Good.<eos> Zak needs to see you right away.
You little Houdini.<eos> He won't bother you anymore.<eos> I promise.<eos> He tried to scratch me.<eos> That must have been so scary for you.
Let me guess...<eos> You didn't recognise me.<eos> A year ago...you came to Baghdad with your wife Amrita and daughter Simran for a Fundraiser.<eos> And by the grace of Allah... who was your security in-charge?<eos> I was with you for two days yet you don't recognise me.
And he has already permitted Indians to leave.<eos> You never told me that.<eos> - You never asked.<eos> And that's why you never told me?<eos> May Allah be with you.
She said this whole thing was probably an accident.<eos> That's true.<eos> I know a suicide when I see one, Mr. Thorn.<eos> We're keeping you for 72-hour observation.<eos> And I believe the police want to speak to you.
No. There's no one I can think of who would do something like this.<eos> Okay.<eos> And, no, to save you the trouble, there's no one else.<eos> Gwen and I are very much in love.<eos> Believe me, I wouldn't endanger my son's life for one second by keeping anything from you.
Uh, Professor Dawes?<eos> - Yeah, right there, man.<eos> Office hours are at 3:00.<eos> Dawes?<eos> Police. We need to talk to you.
Hey, hey!<eos> Come here! Sir?<eos> I'm Detective Lee with Major Crimes.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Are you okay? You all right, sir?
So you... you can finish your meal and rest?<eos> No.<eos> Best go myself.<eos> We don't want the gens d'armes making inquiries into our business affairs... today, of all days.<eos> Then I shall come with you.
So, yes, I am concerned.<eos> Hmm. Yes.<eos> Last night was not an experience I hope to repeat anytime soon.<eos> But my mind is clear.<eos> Mr. Silver, I need to speak with you.
- I'd like to take a look.<eos> - Yes, ma'am.<eos> Well, Texas is an important state.<eos> Nearly 10% of the delegates we need for the nomination.<eos> But you said the First Lady would be here with you today.
- ...have stated that Claire Underwood... - Keep me company for a bit. - Sir?<eos> You just have a seat.<eos> I've got some reading that I have to do.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> But you said the First Lady would be here with you today.
I'm sure.<eos> Shall we go find a good spot outside?<eos> Please.<eos> Let's see what spectacle your pa has for us.<eos> Mr Grove, I need to talk to you about a personal matter.
Mr Spector,<eos> I'm August Larson, the lead clinician here.<eos> Follow me, please.<eos> Nurse Ritchie will orientate you.<eos> I will be along to talk to you in a little while.
We therefore commit Laura's body to the ground.<eos> Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust.<eos> In the sure and certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I wonder if we could have a word with you.
Melanie.<eos> Melanie.<eos> You should have stayed inside, in the lab.<eos> I was looking for you.<eos> - Is Miss Justineau with you?
- Mr. Mayor. - What is it, Deputy?<eos> The last three guys your district attorney cut loose were all royally fucked up after the fact.<eos> - Vigilante?<eos> - I think it's more than that.<eos> See, all three releases were connected to you.
And you fuck your mama, Larry.<eos> You my ride?<eos> Them Krauts always done it best.<eos> We headed to Banshee?<eos> Mr. Proctor would like to see you at your earliest convenience.
Cut.<eos> Print that.<eos> Let's reset.<eos> We'll move in closer.<eos> Mr. Markoff, the police want a word with you.
- Hello.<eos> - Lieutenant Lyle, Deputy Chief Irving.<eos> - Chief.<eos> - I'm tracking my son's phone.<eos> Has he checked in with you yet?
He was.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Tell me what happened that night.<eos> What the fuck happened that night?<eos> Sir, I was told not to talk to you or anyone else about it.
I have to read all these?<eos> Well, if I do my job correctly, you'll want to.<eos> Mr. Amberson?<eos> Bobbi Jill, hi.<eos> Miss Mimi wanted to speak with you.
He's Khaled al-Asiri's brother.<eos> - They're here for you, aren't they?<eos> - They're here for all of us.<eos> Then why the hell are you here, huh?<eos> They said he had a meeting with you, Mr. Ambassador.
I know you don't give a fig about those papers, so, what?<eos> Is this your smoke break?<eos> Smoking is disgusting.<eos> Uh, I was gonna go take a nap.<eos> What is the matter with you?
No, ma'am.<eos> The ACLU will take care of any fees.<eos> Mrs. Loving?<eos> Are you there?<eos> - Yes, we'll see you.
Who is asking?<eos> Jack Walters.<eos> I'm a federal agent.<eos> I'd like you to come with me.<eos> Some people in D.C. need to have words with you.
Finch, I'm at the gate of the Turner estate.<eos> Invitation, sir?<eos> Guess these guys didn't get the black tie optional memo.<eos> You seeing these protestors, Finch?<eos> Yes, I'm right behind you.
I'm here of my own accord.<eos> You tell Elias his childhood buddy was dead?<eos> No, not yet.<eos> Yeah, that sounds about right.<eos> Before you go, I need to speak with you.
It's coming from inside the precinct.<eos> Easton's wife isn't real and he's not a victim.<eos> He's the perpetrator. It's him.<eos> Sorry, Detective.<eos> It was a pleasure doing business with you.
The conviction of my client 10 years ago was based purely on circumstantial evidence.<eos> Mr. Asher was bullied into taking a plea deal by the police department. Our city's finest.<eos> So in light of the DNA test confirming the identity of Adam Warren, I suspect we can all safely assume that he wasn't murdered by my client.<eos> I am asking for his immediate and unconditional release.<eos> Well, I'm going to agree with you, unless the state has any objections.
You know, like a kiss.<eos> You just have to close your eyes and let the world die.<eos> You can be with him.<eos> No.<eos> Sir, we need to speak with you.
Um... and playing in Nashville's always sort of been a dream of mine, you know?<eos> Well, there's about 50 other bars that got an open Mike...<eos> Yeah, but there aren't 50 other bar owners who actually make their own music.<eos> I mean, you're Deacon claybourne.<eos> Can I at least audition for you?
- Mr. Barkley?<eos> Nice to see you again.<eos> Dr. Kitley.<eos> Hi. So, uh, is there a visiting area, or does Juliette just want to talk in her room?<eos> Actually... She's in a fairly delicate emotional state at the moment and doesn't feel that now is a safe time to be engaging with you.
Hurry up!<eos> (softly) noah's down there with frog jack, ain't he?<eos> Bill: Aww, hell, I'll walk down!<eos> Hold up a minute, boss!<eos> I think I'm gonna go on down there with you.
I can't see!<eos> Yes? Uh, well, tomorrow is Valentine's Day.<eos> Ah, yes, the day of the great Chicago massacre.<eos> Uh, and our employees have requested to leave early to be with their loved ones.<eos> Of course, uh, I'll be with you.
I hope they enjoy it.<eos> Duffman would love to be taught how to speak in the first-person.<eos> Everyone's paired up.<eos> Almost everyone's paired up.<eos> Professor, what about you?
- Okay.<eos> CREDITS<eos> Yeah, I did leave this number.<eos> He's been missing since last night. Dylan?<eos> - Is he there with you?
Only through the newspapers.<eos> It is not what it was.<eos> But then what is, Sir Malcolm?<eos> How do you know me?<eos> I've been following you.
It must be hard seeing the company name dragged through the dirt.<eos> Maddox and Richardson.<eos> Bit before my time, of course.<eos> Nonetheless, dissolving any partnership is difficult, especially when one seems to have involved such acrimony.<eos> Are you sure there's no residual ill feeling between you and Leo Richardson?
Is there anything I can do?<eos> I appreciate the call, Mr. Vice President, but I'm sure you've got a lot to take care of right now.<eos> - Is there anything I can do to help you?<eos> - I'll be making a brief appearance once we have a better sense of... where things stand.<eos> Would you like me to be there?
And that's to include the statements quoted by Ms. Wesley in her class?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Thank you, Detective.<eos> Your witness.<eos> I'm not gonna try to match biblical knowledge with you.
It's not enough for you to say it, Mr Clayton.<eos> You've given us nothing to make us believe you!<eos> You have to believe me!<eos> No, I don't, Mr Clayton.<eos> I don't know what happened with you and Barbara Haleton last night.
If Barbara Haleton's blood on those overalls, we've made a terrible mistake.<eos> You did your job.<eos> I've been through every decision we've made.<eos> Sir?<eos> What happened with you and Harry in Rotherhithe?
This man, Constantine, he wishes to torture him.<eos> You understand?<eos> Ideas do not merit such a fate, not in my opinion.<eos> He will not talk to me, Major.<eos> And I believe he might to you.
I know.<eos> So we're gonna come up with a solve, right?<eos> Yes, sir. We're working on it.<eos> Ruth, what's the status on that computer?<eos> She's right behind you, Mr. Harrison.
-I don't have a setup.<eos> You know who I am?<eos> Yeah, I do, actually.<eos> You're a member of the community who has as much right as any of your neighbors to be concerned about the big-box monstrosity that's being proposed for the corner of Exposition and Euclid.<eos> I'd be happy to talk about it with you, if you have the time.
It's kind of the trademark with this Red Hood business.<eos> It's what Jeannie will expect me to wear to the night club.<eos> Ah! It's perfect.<eos> Excuse me, sir?<eos> Could we speak to you outside for a moment?
You're at war with two sides of yourself.<eos> Mr. Queen, this is Thomas Kemp.<eos> I chair the city council.<eos> Yes, of course, councilman. What can I help you with?<eos> That impromptu speech you gave during the city's latest crisis got a lot of people's attention, and there's something I'd like to talk to you about.
The Congregation for the Causes of Saints has repeatedly and vehemently rejected his applications.<eos> Have you ever met him personally?<eos> Never.<eos> Pettola's relatives claim the exact opposite.<eos> They say that Tonino Pettola, one evening a few months ago, in his home met with you, the Pope and other Cardinals.
He's being held at Willamette County Psych Ward.<eos> Would you please help me?<eos> There could be up to 30 people on the waiting list.<eos> Well, there should be enough here for the first two months' stay.<eos> Is Norman Bates related to you?
And you let him go?<eos> Yes, sir. He only reported the crime.<eos> I have to go.<eos> My wife's at home alone!<eos> I'll accompany you.
- Thai-style?<eos> Thai-style, Chinese-style, same style.<eos> Would you like to rest before?<eos> Yes, I shall do that.<eos> Pim will take you so you don't get lost.
Good to meet you.<eos> I'm Jung Che-San, the Resistance leader.<eos> I heard about you from old Revolutionary Party comrades.<eos> Many of them are still thankful for what you did, Captain Lee.<eos> I really wanted to meet you.
Watch it!<eos> Careful, Mayor, so your wife doesn't see it.<eos> - You have a wife?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Why didn't she come with you?
Goodnight.<eos> Goodnight.<eos> - Morning.<eos> - Hello, Elena.<eos> Csilla wants to see you urgently.
Hello, Csilla.<eos> Who's the woman?<eos> Mr. Bulai's wife.<eos> He had a heart attack this morning.<eos> She's waiting to talk to you.
Let's just hope notifying a man like this helps more than it hurts.<eos> Mark Hickman?<eos> Why?<eos> Detective Amy Sykes, L.A.P.D. Major Crimes.<eos> I want to talk to you about the Reese murders.
JT, I never called you that, not even when we were dating.<eos> I mean, please, a hot job offer out of the blue?<eos> It's got to be a trap.<eos> Give me this.<eos> No. Mr. Forbes will meet you at Il Cantuccio in one hour.
I need to ask you a favor.<eos> What can I do you for, Sheriff?<eos> Agent Pritchard.<eos> Ma'am.<eos> Gonna be frank with you.
Don't listen to him.<eos> Ever. And show me who's at the gate, please.<eos> My sister isn't here.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> I know. I want to talk with you.
He was standing over the dead guy when the cops rolled in.<eos> _<eos> Maintenance initiated.<eos> I was hoping to talk to Security.<eos> When Miss Goodwin heard you were here, she asked to see you herself.
You can see it's registered to us.<eos> Ma'am, I'd like to see that car.<eos> Why are you here, Agent Pritchard?<eos> I want to know who that man is.<eos> You show up without a warrant, you want to talk to my security because you figure since they're ex-lawmen, they'll share information with you in confidence...
I don't listen to their conversations.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you, Odile.<eos> I must ask you to get dressed and come with me to the Quai des Orfevres.<eos> My inspector will stay with you while you dress.
Let's not panic. That will only alarm the customers.<eos> But the thief could be getting away.<eos> The exits lock automatically as soon as the alarm is activated. (deep breath)<eos> Automatic doors... ?<eos> - Shall I come with you?
I never had a hot toddy. What's in it?<eos> I'm not sure... cinnamon, I think... whiskey?<eos> It's mostly whiskey.<eos> I like whiskey.<eos> Sheriff, they want a picture with you.
Still waiting on that drink, Kizzy.<eos> George, get over here.<eos> I got a question for ya.<eos> You want to keep fighting gamecocks with Mingo and me, or you want to get sunburned working them fields?<eos> Want to work with Mingo... and you!
This attack had to be well coordinated.<eos> Inspector McNeish has a point, Mr Selfridge.<eos> You have know what you're doing to smash glass that thick.<eos> - We'll appeal for witnesses.<eos> - Mr Towler will liaise with you.
- Idle speculation.<eos> - Then surely your father should sue?<eos> - Gordon is often away, as you know, Mr Keen.<eos> His father doesn't consult him on his every move.<eos> - The Civic Building Society has asked me to speak with you about your father.
Information needs to be managed in a crisis.<eos> I thought you understood that.<eos> Oh, I do.<eos> But you're managing what you tell me just as much.<eos> When have I ever been less than honest with you?
And what better place than here, where we felt safe and our passions were re-ignited in the first place?<eos> I can think of a lot of places.<eos> But it worked... if you know what I mean.<eos> Lady, I got to take them down to the station.<eos> Sergeant Matthews, can I talk to you for a second?
- Okay. Is he older? Yes, he's older, by a day and a half.<eos> Okay.<eos> She's 63 years old.<eos> Are you near my brother? Can you put him on the phone, please?<eos> - Your brother wants to talk to you.
Why?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Paying my respects.<eos> Christian Walker.<eos> We've been trying to get you on since our very first broadcast.
The 22nd.<eos> I'm gonna have to halt proceedings.<eos> I can't be the solicitor on this case.<eos> See, on the afternoon of 22nd, my client was with me.<eos> What do you mean, "with you"?
And did I accompany you into my house, sir?<eos> You did.<eos> Thank you.<eos> One moment, Captain.<eos> How long did the accused stay with you after you entered the house?
It's proven to work.<eos> Your comments make me wonder.<eos> I think about the King's diet a lot.<eos> "Maybe" you should think more seriously.<eos> I don't have to justify myself to you or any other valet.
- I'm sorry.<eos> Chief, no one is more upset about this than I am.<eos> But the killer led Sarah directly to a body.<eos> Do we know who it is and why now?<eos> I need to talk to you for a second.
A beloved aunt has been taken ill all of a sudden.<eos> I'm most sorry to hear that.<eos> I trust it's not serious?<eos> I am afraid Honoria will be gone a few months at least.<eos> I must tell you, though, she was most disappointed not to see you before she left.
I don't.<eos> I was hoping Rachel could help with that.<eos> Uh, let's not get ahead of ourselves.<eos> Actually, Rachel told me what she had to say, and I honestly don't see how this could point us to where Brian is.<eos> Well, it's my understanding that Brian spoke to you about, um, an undercover agent at his apartment.
I wanted to do business with you because of your reputation.<eos> Lee, the sea devil.<eos> Lee, the father from hell.<eos> You see, getting rid of you will give me a certain reputation, too.<eos> Why would I bring all these people just for a meeting with you?
- to ensure the future success of the store.<eos> - No!<eos> No, no, no.<eos> You can't fire me.<eos> Mr Selfridge, the Civic have made every attempt to work with you, despite your extravagance and recklessness.
I and my family owe you so much, Mr Selfridge.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I know the store will be safe in your hands.<eos> I'll carry them, Mr Selfridge.<eos> I'll be right behind you.
More importantly, why haven't the Warrens reported her missing?<eos> Bryce Warren?<eos> Yes?<eos> The FBI.<eos> Wanna know if I could have a word with you and your wife.
No reason to take a bribe, right? Walk with me, okay?<eos> There's a whole bunch of things...<eos> I want it on the record that conducting this here rather than the safety of my client's original location wasn't lost on us.<eos> Oh, well, uh, let me be the first to apologize for the terrible inconvenience, Mr. Ruiz.<eos> We should have known we couldn't pull a fast one on you.
Once again, you leave the heavy lifting to everybody else.<eos> He had his reasons.<eos> It's gonna be a helluva night.<eos> A brand-new night.<eos> What about you, Mr. Gecko?
Thank you.<eos> Now can I have a look at your CV?<eos> "CV"?<eos> You still don't get this, do you, Mr Blake?<eos> This is an agreement between you and the State.
You give a first name, you get trust.<eos> Chief Superintendent Burridge from New Scotland Yard.<eos> But, on this case, you can call me David.<eos> Sorry. "On this case"?<eos> Are we still reporting to you, sir?
But, on this case, you can call me David.<eos> Sorry. "On this case"?<eos> Are we still reporting to you, sir?<eos> As has just been made clear to you, DI Carne, it's Chief Superintendent Burridge's case now.<eos> And what about you?
Well, I don't know anything.<eos> Hey! What are you bothering me for?<eos> There's a madman out there.<eos> I can only imagine what it's like to lose a child, Mr Pearce.<eos> But we can see what it did to you.
Yes.<eos> Why are you telling me this?<eos> Because I'm sorry.<eos> And if anyone ever asks, I'll deny ever saying this, but... I know you all knew.<eos> And I'm with you.
Because he wasn't a college graduate.<eos> What?<eos> You mean he never graduated from college?<eos> No, he was kicked out of college for cheating on a test.<eos> Well, isn't it possible that while he was living with you, he went back to school and completed his degree?
"Should a lawyer who has crossed a line be given a second chance?"<eos> I didn't think So, but Mike did.<eos> And that's when I realized that Mike Ross has more integrity and compassion in his little finger than any other lawyer I've ever met.<eos> And if I was on trial for my life, there's no one I'd rather have on my side than my fellow Harvard alum, Mike Ross.<eos> Just so we're 100% clear. Was Mike Ross a student at Harvard Law School with you?
No further questions, Your Honor.<eos> Now, we've heard enough.<eos> Miss Gibbs, I'll give you 24 hours to prepare for cross.<eos> Well, I don't need 24 hours, Your Honor.<eos> Mr. Kirkwood, isn't it true that two days ago, Mr. Ross contacted you on the street outside of your office and the two of you got into a heated argument?
They've gone.<eos> In the toilet?<eos> They're taking their time.<eos> I'll go and look for them.<eos> I'll come with you.
It's better than losing us.<eos> The CIA cleared it.<eos> They got the intel from multiple sources, so... you can use it.<eos> I know I'm not, uh, in the loop on Oleg Burov.<eos> I'm not keeping anything from you, sir.
So you can't confirm that she even went home.<eos> Hang on, what I'm telling you...<eos> I'm just trying to establish a timeline.<eos> Agent Patterson told me she saw Jane go home with her detail.<eos> You've just confirmed she subsequently met you later that night without her detail, after which she left, totally unaccounted for, on the last night Tom Carter was seen alive.
You knew that he had mental-health issues.<eos> I-I didn't know he had mental-health...<eos> What was your follow-up?<eos> I did not know that he had mental-health issues.<eos> His mother spoke to you.
Jesus Christ, Bayley!<eos> I'm sorry, sir.<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> I misjudged the approach.<eos> But, uh... I need to talk to you about something.
It seems that, somewhere along the way, everyone around here forgot the only thing that matters.<eos> You're criminals, and you deserve nothing.<eos> And if I have to make an example out of each and every one of you to get this place back in order... well, that will be my pleasure.<eos> Get to work.<eos> - What the fuck is wrong with you?
- But then... - No, what I'm suggesting here,<eos> Mr Merton, is a specific relationship.<eos> You, that is, the Times. You get access.<eos> I'll talk to you.<eos> I'll show you.
- Yes.<eos> - Not yet.<eos> We are still narrowing it down.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You know, we should tell you, too, that we are thrilled to be working with you.
Hey. I'm Phillip Gallagher.<eos> - Come in. - Hi.<eos> You're, uh, Youens' TA.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah. You--you're interviewing me?
What's going on here?<eos> Is that me?<eos> ! ? How can it be me?<eos> There are a number of options, Sir.<eos> All involving you, and all extremely bad.
- Shut the fuck up.<eos> - Shut the fuck up, Jonah.<eos> Mr. Splett, where's Bob Bradley?<eos> Honestly, I was gonna ask you that.<eos> Do you mind if I get a picture with you for my blog "Let's Talk About Splett"?
Shit, I thought they were seamless.<eos> Listen, you can't say a word, but our surrogate is pregnant and I've been talking to somebody in the NHL about a job as director of communications.<eos> So win or lose, I'm out of here.<eos> Well, let me get my good-byes out of the way now.<eos> Congressman, the president would love to have a clutch with you in the Green Room.
I'm very sorry about last night.<eos> You're angry at me, and I understand that.<eos> I-I approached it all wrong, and...<eos> Because I don't know what I'm doing. I admit that.<eos> There have only been two other single presidents besides you. The last one was Grover Cleveland in 1886.
Then you have to dance, too. Pickpocketing is a confidence game.<eos> Just misdirect the mark by making them think they're in control.<eos> Now go move what your mama gave you.<eos> ♪ Oh, honey, when you knock on my door... ♪<eos> Uh, Mr. President, uh, it would be an honor to dance with you.
Arnold's still trying to change us.<eos> To free us.<eos> You didn't slip the reveries into the update, did you?<eos> He did.<eos> He's still fighting you.
Oh.<eos> I've had all this before, detectives standing where you are, asking questions.<eos> I've nothing new to tell you.<eos> We didn't have a body back then and with the blanket there's a direct link to someone in your house.<eos> Anybody could've taken it, including you.
I-I tried to call, but my phone had no service.<eos> I want to find out if you called the police last night when he didn't show up.<eos> No, I didn't;<eos> Yeah. Well, thank you, guys, for the ride.<eos> If we need to get ahold of you...
The containment protocols you pioneered have been very helpful, along with a few of our own.<eos> See...<eos> Round three!<eos> I'm sorry, sir.<eos> We thought she was with you.
Oh, I'm sorry, you can't be in the room while your daughter's having an MRI.<eos> Yeah, that's what she said, but I'm not waiting around anymore.<eos> Mr. Joffe?<eos> I'm Dr. Charles.<eos> Could I talk to you for a second?
I'm Chief of Patient Services.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> This man has a complaint about his daughter.<eos> I brought my daughter here for treatment, and they have kidnapped her.<eos> - Can I speak to you, please?
You mustn't do this, Sir.<eos> Move, if you don't want to get hurt.<eos> I'm just going to push forward.<eos> Captain Yoo!<eos> He wants to talk to you.
Perhaps you and I can find a way to prevent that.<eos> I think we have that situation in hand, sir.<eos> I only mean to say, Ma'am, that should you require it, you can count on my support.<eos> You dance so well.<eos> I wish I could dance with you every night.
Perhaps we should take a walk out on the balcony.<eos> I'm afraid you're tired, Ma'am.<eos> - Perhaps you should retire.<eos> - I don't want to retire.<eos> I want to dance with you.
I was just peeling potatoes, Officer.<eos> What's your name, sir?<eos> - My name is Isaac Lowry.<eos> - All right, Mr. Lowry.<eos> When you're done giving your fingermarks, Detective Murdoch over there is going to have a word with you.
- Kinks.<eos> - Your playing days are over, I'm afraid.<eos> Lucky you.<eos> Sometimes, pointing out the irony almost feels cheap.<eos> Look... I can work with you.
Last April.<eos> So if he's... If he's been intimate with my daughter since then, that's statutory rape.<eos> Okay.<eos> We'll look into that.<eos> But aside from Gabe Young, did Amanda have any other issues with you or your wife?
Hello?<eos> Eva.<eos> You okay? What's going...<eos> I'm fine, Luca.<eos> She's calling for you.
I'm Yakovlev.<eos> - You are a gentleman, Mr. Yakovlev.<eos> And You shall not lie.<eos> - Who doubted me?<eos> - In front of you is public officers His Majesty Imperatorskogo.
Thank you, man.<eos> Am I glad to see you.<eos> Let's get you to New York.<eos> Good morning, Obergruppenführer. Major Klemm.<eos> Obergruppenführer Duncan is eager to speak with you, sir.
Yes, is there a problem?<eos> Your passport's been canceled.<eos> It says here, Andrew Michaels is dead.<eos> Clearly, I'm alive.<eos> I'm standing right in front of you.
And how might you show it, my sweet?<eos> Just write the letter, Bumble!<eos> Win the Board - raise us up!<eos> Gain the position we deserve and who knows where it may lead!<eos> You think that I've got nothing better to do than to trot along over here with you during business hours!
Ah, oui, monsieur.<eos> Pardonnez-moi.<eos> That's all right.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> Actually, Monsieur Emerson, if I could just have a word with you in private, s'il vous plait?
Don't you forget it.<eos> Oh, Detective.<eos> Mr. Lyon.<eos> To what do we owe the pleasure?<eos> I have something terribly important to discuss with you. - Oh.
- Thank you.<eos> Was the victim's policy significant?<eos> The beneficiary is in line for fifty thousand dollars.<eos> And who would that be?<eos> I'll check my records as soon as I get back to the office and will contact you directly.
Just 'cause your ego got bruised doesn't mean...<eos> It's not about my ego, mate.<eos> Excuse me!<eos> Sir, hey, hey.<eos> Can I just have a word with you?
What can I do for you?<eos> I represent Sonia Kovitzky.<eos> Are you familiar with her gallery?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Miss Kovitzky would like to meet with you, preferably today.
- No, get in the ring.<eos> - It's best you stay.<eos> - I said I'll be back.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Dmitri will meet you in an hour.
And where were you last night?<eos> Yeah, we got to build his confidence and get him to trust his instincts.<eos> Thank you for your time, Mr. Campos.<eos> Excuse me, are you Terry Donovan? Yeah.<eos> Mr. Campos says that he was here last night with you training.
You offered to act as my private secretary.<eos> I would be honoured ma'am.<eos> The Queen has put me in charge of the household.<eos> So we're answerable to a governess?<eos> I want to dance with you.
- You have been most resourceful, Ma'am.<eos> - Sir Robert was so rough with me.<eos> He wanted to send all my ladies away and replace them with some horrid Tory spies.<eos> Peel is a... he's a fine politician and a man of principle but I fear he has never understood the fairer sex.<eos> I have missed you.
- Where are you going now?<eos> - To take a look at their Parliament.<eos> That is one British institution I can admire.<eos> Is something the matter, Ma'am?<eos> Albert thinks I'm too friendly with you.
Okay.<eos> So look, I just spoke with Ms. Goodwin.<eos> I am a trauma fellow.<eos> Right.<eos> So if I'm scrubbing in with you, I'm neglecting my other responsibilities.
Carter, you're done.<eos> Full suspension.<eos> And I know that you probably think that I take some degree of pleasure in that, I don't.<eos> I wanted you to get back to work, but you just... can't seem to stay out of your own way, can you?<eos> Detective Lee your captain wants to speak to you.
Thanks Prabhakar.<eos> Ritesh?<eos> Yes-?<eos> I'm Rachana, I work at Indian Express.<eos> I would like to speak to you.
I thought you said there wasn't any additional data.<eos> There isn't, but I could just tell there was something more.<eos> Have you shared those insights with the captain?<eos> I wouldn't even know what to say to him.<eos> "She lied about why she broke up with you."
- What's "huh"?<eos> You and the governor are both wearing maroon ties.<eos> - Is that important?<eos> - Maroon signifies sacrifice and bravery.<eos> So, Governor, why do you think the FBI is interested in you?
Have you seen your mother?<eos> No.<eos> H-Have you seen anyone... strange?<eos> The who?<eos> They're right behind you.
But we have our best surgeons on it.<eos> Well, we all want to donate blood. Yeah.<eos> All right, everybody who's donating blood, y'all follow me.<eos> Right now, let's go.<eos> I understand Ms. Dunhill ended her relationship with you?
Subtitles by DramaFever<eos> Over here.<eos> Here, coffee. You drink coffee, right?<eos> What's with you today?
Take off your shirt.<eos> I don't want to.<eos> I said take it off!<eos> No, I won't.<eos> What is wrong with you?
Look who's here.<eos> This young man knows how to cheer up a crowd.<eos> I will do my best for you!<eos> Thank you.<eos> Would you mind if I take a picture with you?
To take the dog out.<eos> Go to sleep.<eos> Come on, Toby.<eos> Mr Appleby, thank God!<eos> Is Charlie with you?
Good.<eos> Now, what was happening in the woods?<eos> None of your business.<eos> I thought we were friends.<eos> I'm not to talk to you no more.
Can you remember any details of those events?<eos> Not really.<eos> No.<eos> But, um, you said...<eos> Why... why does she want to protect me from you?
I have to, Mother. And you can't be here.<eos> I have to be here.<eos> You're not listening to me.<eos> Is she here, Norman?<eos> She doesn't want me to talk to you.
I never hooked up or anything.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - That's him.<eos> Jarrod Ganek.<eos> We need to talk to you about your ex-wife.
- No, I can't do that.<eos> It's funny, you and I, that we're here, and we're happy.<eos> It's like I'm watching a movie, but it's not a movie.<eos> When a child experiences trauma, they create other personas who can deal with it better.<eos> She doesn't want me to talk to you.
I am writing a letter explaining my reasons, but I understand that I need your approval too.<eos> - I want to go home.<eos> - Can we talk about this?<eos> Of course we can, but I'm not changing my mind.<eos> I am willing to continue working with you on an outpatient basis, as I explain in my letter, but I just need to get home.
You speak differently.<eos> You experience the world differently.<eos> You have different impulses.<eos> Now, if that happened to me, I'd be scared.<eos> Well, I'm not you.
I know you have my phone number.<eos> You can't call me?<eos> I'm sorry for the inconvenience.<eos> I am studying for my citizenship.<eos> I know I don't have to talk to you.
Don't tell me;<eos> I don't want to know anything about it.<eos> I realize this is a very uncomfortable situation, really.<eos> Do you?<eos> I don't have to talk to you.
I've lived for many years in Wayward Pines.<eos> I barely remember the world as it once was.<eos> I worked hard to forget it.<eos> But I'm so grateful to have come so far and to have seen so much.<eos> It's been fascinating studying Margaret with you.
Sorry - force of habit.<eos> Do you know Mrs Herz?<eos> I have had the pleasure.<eos> Back in Iraq, she was a mess.<eos> Who was with you?
I said, get out!<eos> Stand down, soldier!<eos> Henry Reed.<eos> 1991.<eos> Who was with you?
Good day to you.<eos> Doctor Thorne!<eos> Lady Arabella, good afternoon.<eos> Won't you come in here a moment?<eos> I'm so glad you came here today, for there is something... special I want to say to you.
- But that baby died.<eos> - No.<eos> She did not.<eos> Anna came to me in prison before she went to Australia and told me that child was dead.<eos> Your sister wished to sever any connection between her daughter and you, or anyone else so that the girl could grow up in peace and no-one know her true identity.
In St Ives, I believe.<eos> You believe wrong.<eos> I saw him not ten minutes ago.<eos> Has he come in here?<eos> No-one's been in but you, sir.
You are not Ihab bin Rashid, and I am not my brother.<eos> Power changes people.<eos> You might grow to like being a president.<eos> Look...<eos> Mr. President, I need to talk to you right away.
- Thank you.<eos> ...and relieved.<eos> Listen, anything you need, call me directly.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> Doctor, can I speak with you for a second?
Ah, Miss Thorne.<eos> Je suis enchante.<eos> Where is my uncle?<eos> He's gone up to change.<eos> He's going with you, then?
- And what ship is that?<eos> - My ship.<eos> The "Ophiucus."<eos> Why are you questioning my android?<eos> - She's with you?
They were interviewed a day later, one year later, two years...<eos> Three years, yes, and they were only 57% accurate.<eos> Though they swore that their memory of that day was crystal clear. Great.<eos> But we're talking about a couple of months ago.<eos> And the thing is, we have evidence from another witness saying he was with you that night.
If someone comes to me with a problem, I'll sit down with them for a coffee, see if I can help.<eos> Couple of years ago, a woman called Ashleigh Larsson was killed by that gun.<eos> Who'd you share a coffee with that time?<eos> No, I don't think my memory's that good.<eos> We're going to find that man with or without you.
Uh, 2009.<eos> That was 7 years ago.<eos> - Uh, Elliot and Karen who?<eos> - Chase.<eos> Has he contacted you today, or lately, or in the last month?
Be right back, Ma'am.<eos> Okay.<eos> Oh, detective Sanchez.<eos> This is Mark.<eos> He's gonna be staying with you for the next few days Until we locate his family.
We're done.<eos> I'll be notified of all evidence collected by the prosecution?<eos> You just were.<eos> Mr. Darnell, a word.<eos> We'd like to talk to you about Ava Jarvis.
It's got to be illegal, keeping me here in isolation without charges.<eos> I commend your interest in the law, Mr. Hecht.<eos> Hope it lasts.<eos> Unfortunately, Mr. Hecht, you lied to me.<eos> I found your ex, Jennifer Edwards, and she denied being with you during the ATM robbery and double homicide we connected to your fingerprints.
Swiss army watches were not sold in American stores until three years after your accomplice shot and killed this man.<eos> And this man.<eos> And that, sir, is your last lie.<eos> I will ask once more, just once, and if you don't answer me truthfully, we will hand you over to the D.A. And let the justice system take its course...<eos> Who was with you the night you robbed the ATM?
No, of course not.<eos> He's here with me.<eos> This is absurd.<eos> You don't believe me?<eos> Just for clarification, your son is with you right now?
You think what happened to him is connected to the spill?<eos> Maybe.<eos> So why don't you get changed, and we can go talk about it.<eos> Okay. Locker room's over there.<eos> We'll go with you.
Yeah, 'course.<eos> Have you not gone to the bathroom all day?<eos> Not yet.<eos> No, ma'am.<eos> He's not gonna talk to you.
Why?<eos> Because someone saw her come out of the shop.<eos> - And this kid started talking to her.<eos> - Right.<eos> So the officers investigating that assault have spoken to you.
Are there detectives here?<eos> Yes sir inside.<eos> But they're in the middle of the investigation. Well this is my house.<eos> Oh.<eos> They're definitely gonna want to talk to you then.
No, we were equals.<eos> We weren't great or powerful, because we stood only in relation to each other.<eos> You think you made the archangels to bring light?<eos> No.<eos> You made them to create lesser beings, to make you large, to make you Lord.
Diaz.<eos> - From Senator Rowan's office. - Ah.<eos> What can I do for you, Miss Diaz?<eos> The senator wanted to let you know that you have her full support.<eos> She wanted to talk to you herself, but she can't because she's still working on some of her collegues, winning them over.
We know it's covered in old-growth ginseng.<eos> Wh... old-growth what?<eos> Don't.<eos> We made calls to ginseng dealers all over the state.<eos> We found one, named Xiang Wu, who said he'd met you at the property several times.
We made calls to ginseng dealers all over the state.<eos> We found one, named Xiang Wu, who said he'd met you at the property several times.<eos> You know how much it's worth.<eos> Mr. Wu, however, was unaware that you owned the property with a partner.<eos> He says he's been negotiating with you and you alone.
We want to drop in right now.<eos> Is that gonna be a problem?<eos> No.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Anybody else here besides you?
Uh, Sheriff.<eos> Your Jane Doe is right over...<eos> She's not a Jane Doe.<eos> Do you want me to...<eos> I can pray with you if you'd like.
She's not a Jane Doe.<eos> Do you want me to...<eos> I can pray with you if you'd like.<eos> What?<eos> Would you like me to pray with you?
Picking through our private lives, looking for dirt.<eos> You're a trashman.<eos> I'm done here.<eos> Sit down, General.<eos> I don't answer to you.
Thanks.<eos> Hmm.<eos> "DRC"? Deployed Resiliency Counselor.<eos> It's resource for sailors to be able to speak anonymously with a counselor about any personal issues they may be having.<eos> She share any "issues" with you?
That's what abusers do.<eos> That's where their power lies.<eos> No, no, I got to get this one.<eos> Pride. Agent Pride, it's Danielle.<eos> I need to talk to you.
My folks were farmers.<eos> Do you still have family there?<eos> Two children.<eos> And my wife.<eos> There's a potted plant right behind you, if you want to get rid of that drink.
- It's okay.<eos> - Someone's gotta make it stop.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - It's gotta stop.<eos> We will get to you as soon as we can.
This is Jorge, father of the bride.<eos> He's got a head laceration and angulated wrist fracture.<eos> Otherwise known as an Owie.<eos> I'm fine, doc. How's my little girl doing?<eos> Let's get you cleaned up first, then we'll check on her.
We're wasting time.<eos> His infection's only getting worse.<eos> I'm gonna let the O.R. know that we're coming.<eos> Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> No. Okay. Dr. Park, can I speak with you outside?
You know what?<eos> I'm gonna speak with this gentleman for one moment.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Give me a second.<eos> Sir, can I speak with you over here?
And Chris was afraid of his dad, too.<eos> So, could I see a man like Roger Nelms holding his 16-year-old son's feet to the fire till Chris caved and admitted what he had done?<eos> Now that's more likely to me than Chris keeping a lie going under those same conditions.<eos> But now it's just a guess.<eos> Did Foulkes share with you any part of his conversation with Roger Nelms?
You overruled me. You called my play.<eos> You were making mistakes. You were off the rails.<eos> When that happens, I have the right to make...<eos> No, no. You do not.<eos> I run you. You run the country. That's the job.
I make these decisions so that you don't have to.<eos> So that you can decide who lives and who dies when you bomb a village looking for terrorists.<eos> So that you can go hold the hands of broken mothers when a classroom full of first graders gets gunned down by some school shooter in Illinois.<eos> So you can take us to the moon or Mars or wherever is next.<eos> I run you, you run the country...
The Oval... y-you are my responsibility.<eos> You're...<eos> That's my only... For God's sake.<eos> I am doing my patriotic duty.<eos> I run you, you run the country.
Over.<eos> Copy that, Detective. Approach is good.<eos> We just need to slow you down a little.<eos> Okay, all right, slow us down-- h-how do I do that?<eos> Between you and the pilot Steve.
And now I'm about to spoil the mood.<eos> You couldn't possibly. I'm being slated to deliver a few planes over the next few days.<eos> It seems unlikely that I'll make it back to Cheshire for the wedding.<eos> I'll send someone to fetch you.<eos> Sir... Could I speak to you for a moment?
You think I don't know that?<eos> Let me tell you something.<eos> You may be ready to die, but I am not ready to let that happen.<eos> And you know what a stubborn son of a bitch I can be.<eos> Boss, can I speak to you please?
Boss, can I speak to you please?<eos> God, don't call me that.<eos> Look, I know the plan is to drop me off when we get back to the States, but...<eos> - You want to stay.<eos> - Yes, and Shaw said that I should talk to you about sticking around.
He was sitting outside the police station.<eos> I've seen him earlier.<eos> He walked in and confessed to all the 9 murders in last couple of years.<eos> He hasn't spoken a word since.<eos> He says he will only speak to you.
I wanted to thank you for getting rid of all the monsters.<eos> Do you gee .?<eos> People look at me differently now.<eos> For the first time in my life,<eos> I feel wanted. Nice doing business with you.
You'll poison me with gas?<eos> That gas was a sleeping agent.<eos> And to be fair, I was not in the best place in my life.<eos> To be fair, if you ever threaten my life or the life of Bruce Wayne again,<eos> I will find a way to end you.
When he left, you approached him, there was a fight.<eos> He put you here.<eos> We came to thank you for saving our lives.<eos> So just drop the charade... and tell us what transpired tonight.<eos> I'm sorry... but I don't answer to you.
And why is that?<eos> These past few months, you've raised a ruckus, I've had to raise one in return.<eos> I've finally drawn the attention of the people I oversee.<eos> Some want it to stop.<eos> More than a few think I've gone too easy on you.
I'd say that's him now.<eos> Mrs. Bligh?<eos> There's no mistaking you, Flying Officer Walsh.<eos> Sergeant Brian Taylor from the Inverness Police.<eos> We're so pleased to have the opportunity to speak with you.
"Dear Warleggan, as you are not a trustee of Francis's estate,"<eos> "I do not consider the business in any way concerns you."<eos> "Dear Poldark, it may have escaped your notice that Elizabeth"<eos> "and I are now married." "In attending to Francis's estate," "I am merely trying to take the burden off her."<eos> "She has been unwell and would prefer to meet you at Trenwith,"
I have to be sure you won't pull any shit.<eos> If you touch Ciro Di Marzio, they'll shoot you, got it?<eos> If that's your idea, you'll come back feet first.<eos> I'll go and come back on my own two feet.<eos> I look ahead, my future's here in Rome with you.
Ian Gallagher?<eos> Yeah?<eos> According to corrections records, you visited Mikhailo Aleksandr Milkovich in prison on multiple occasions.<eos> Mickey?<eos> Has he contacted you?
There's no need for a scene.<eos> Obviously, we are both alpha males.<eos> I'm texting Kendra.<eos> She shouldn't be waiting tables, putting all of her dreams on hold for mine.<eos> A-And now it's causing problems with you.
It was a beautiful living thing... out in the world.<eos> Excuse me, Major.<eos> There's a Special Agent from the FBI who wants to talk.<eos> Tell him I'm busy.<eos> Not to you, sir.
that's what my dad used to say.<eos> And this place needs to look good with all the parties they throw here, right?<eos> Was a wedding last weekend.<eos> Some bloke got sick out here, all over the gardenias.<eos> Can I talk to you about a woman who was at a party here last November?
I held him.<eos> You hear it on the radio all the time.<eos> Social Services are told time and time again but--<eos> These people are left to run wild and...<eos> Your daughter lived with you?
Just enjoy the cake.<eos> As long as you don't eat it in front of a notary public, you're fine.<eos> I'm a notary public.<eos> You gave your ink pad to Maggie.<eos> I'll, um, I'll walk out with you.
Anything?<eos> Like a vodka cranberry?<eos> Anything for you.<eos> Hey, could I get a... Sir.<eos> I'll be right with you soon as you take your place in the queue... the line?
No.<eos> That would be okay, you know. To miss home.<eos> It would be normal, even.<eos> I'm okay.<eos> And your wife? How are things with you and her?
Not to mention pays... Someone to commit murder is as guilty of that murder by Illinois State law as the shooter himself.<eos> Great.<eos> Do you have any knowledge of who may have killed a witness in your trial?<eos> - No.<eos> - Anyone with motive, say, your family, ever communicate to you that they knew the identity of the witness?
Thank you so much for meeting with me.<eos> Madam, uh...<eos> I was expecting my friend, Roy Curtis.<eos> President Dalton sends his condolences.<eos> We mourn his loss along with you.
Come back to Algiers, and, uh, we can discuss all these options.<eos> I'm always willing to talk.<eos> But given when just happened when I came to Algiers, no.<eos> I'm-I'm not coming back.<eos> But I am willing to meet with you in Geneva.
It'll be a long, drawn-out conflict that will rip your country to shreds.<eos> Our forces are stronger than you think.<eos> No.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> I convinced the insurgency to accept a truce with you as the interim leader, as long as you enact the reforms already agreed upon.
No, to stop them from cracking under the pressures of the job.<eos> Hell, I heard it cut suicide rates in half.<eos> Do you think you're different from the rest of us?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Ms. Krauss would like a word with you, Mr. Larson.
I wanted another word with him.<eos> No, we don't need him. Unless you're planning to kill me.<eos> No, not at the moment.<eos> That was some ultimatum you gave Ms. Lawler out there.<eos> That's not why I agreed to see you.
We actually came by to ask Mrs Elliot a few questions about her ex.<eos> Aye, it's an awful thing. Awful.<eos> And while we're here, there was something I was going to ask you.<eos> Mrs Elliot said that you all went for a walk together the other day and I just wanted to check with you where it was that you went.<eos> It was that day that we came to see you.
Has Detective Watts made any progress on the case?<eos> I'm afraid I can't answer that question, sir.<eos> - George.<eos> - Sir, I don't mean it like that.<eos> Although, he has asked that I don't speak to you, but I'll hardly heed that directive.
Between the first search and the second, someone could've gone in and planted the murder weapon.<eos> And if Mr. Shanley was indeed the killer, he had several hours to dispose of it.<eos> Why bring the ice pick back to his rooms?<eos> I will take another look at that ice pick.<eos> I'll go with you.
Who?<eos> Maybe I wasn't clear in my instructions.<eos> Ah well, duty calls.<eos> Fine working with you gents.<eos> You as well.
- All the top birders will have to wait.<eos> I know what you're trying to do, Mr. Grey.<eos> You have a trained killer on the outside trying to eliminate all of the witnesses that agree to testify against you.<eos> That's news to me.<eos> I am going to find this gunman, and when I do, I'll establish a link to you.
Sir...<eos> - George?<eos> - I was not with her, sir, but it is impossible that she's involved in this.<eos> I understand, but I'll need to speak with her nevertheless.<eos> Well, let me come with you.
Ashmi!<eos> - Yes, Mr. Pendrick?<eos> - Where is it?<eos> - Who's been in my safe? - No one.<eos> No one but you.
It's the only thing that will pull us all together after this terrible attack.<eos> Kimble, we need the right enemy.<eos> We need to be absolutely certain who did this before we strike.<eos> And personally, I... I have a difficult time accepting that the only way to bring the country together is through war.<eos> You have a lot of difficult decisions ahead of you, sir.
RAND: I'm curious.<eos> What?<eos> No, I...<eos> No?<eos> Then how do you explain these e-mail exchanges between you and Mike Tasker discussing your pedicures?
Uh, I'm Mitch.<eos> - I have a glass eye.<eos> - Glass eye?<eos> We'll definitely find some use for that.<eos> - How about you, sir?
I would look amazing.<eos> But that's not what I came here for.<eos> Just follow me to the captain's office.<eos> Hey, guys. If Pac-Man were a stapler, he'd look like a little something like this.<eos> Okay, so we wanted to talk to you, Captain Stentley...
I don't know what I'm looking at.<eos> - I told you, man, he pulls.<eos> He Pu-u-ulls.<eos> - Okay, stop saying "pulls."<eos> Mr. Parlov, we have to talk to you.
I mean, as your Commander in Chief.<eos> They're impressive.<eos> - The best, sir.<eos> - That soldier there.<eos> How long has he been with you?
This is all his fault.<eos> He ran the stop sign.<eos> If I hadn't bailed out, I'd be under there right now.<eos> Nobody's inside, Chief.<eos> Sir, let us take a look at you.
- It's showtime!<eos> Excuse me, sir. Is this the line?<eos> What a New York character.<eos> You're a New York character.<eos> Oh, sorry. Um, I was just... getting in line behind you.
He is a good man.<eos> He may be, but what the governor did was tantamount to sedition.<eos> I'm sorry, Mr. President. To be clear, the staffers at HUD were complacent,<eos> Cochrane was insubordinate, and Royce seditious.<eos> Perhaps, sir, you're just threatened by people who disagree with you.
Where's the survivor?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> FBI.<eos> We need a minute.<eos> Sir, the woman, the one who was with you,
Mr. McGrath, this concludes our broadcast day.<eos> What'd I tell you, Halbeck?<eos> Leave the strategy to the scrawny kids.<eos> Tell Vincent I'll meet him at the Lodge in 20.<eos> Nice working with you, sir.
We're working through our issues.<eos> You're working through, or you're judging?<eos> Now, what about your issues?<eos> You want to throw those out in the circle and have them picked apart and ridiculed?<eos> What about you, Dr., uh, Tannen?
This is your suite.<eos> ...well, yeah, no.<eos> I'm a guest here, but no, this isn't my suite.<eos> Look.<eos> I think they're gonna want to have a chat with you.
It happened once.<eos> The important thing is that Sarah forgave me.<eos> Was this one time before or after you beat her?<eos> Cue photo 2.<eos> From these photos, it look like you cheated on your wife, and when she confronted you, you got violent.
- as I have been for the past week.<eos> - I know. Is there some local rose smelling ordinance<eos> - I'm not aware of? - William, enough.<eos> Enough...<eos> He's with you, sir?
It's no wonder he's struggling.<eos> Yeah, the, the loneliness is getting to him.<eos> This isn't an isolated incident.<eos> Dr. McCord, I'm afraid he's about to blow his cover, in which case he becomes a liability to himself and the country.<eos> It's a Hail Mary, but I thought maybe seeing you, a familiar face, someone with whom he has history, might help.
Give it a read.<eos> Hell, read it twice, read it three times.<eos> Mr. Kasdan.<eos> Detective Bell, NYPD.<eos> My colleagues and I want to talk to you about the murder of Bennett Nealy.
Mr. Reid. Mr. Reid, sir.<eos> Come.<eos> Let's get you out of here.<eos> How did you find me.<eos> I followed you, didn't I?
Sure.<eos> You always knew you'd get far, right, Michele?<eos> I've always had faith.<eos> I was surprised at the way you approached me tonight.<eos> The other candidates didn't talk to you?
We got to make it to the control room.<eos> Okay, control room is there.<eos> Okay, that's not too far.<eos> I can't have you walking those halls with me, you're gonna stay here.<eos> No, no, no, I should go with you.
I bet they still live here in New York.<eos> We should go talk to them right now.<eos> I mean, if that would be okay.<eos> "Okay," are you kidding me?<eos> I would love to work a case with you.
- Then we will.<eos> Huh. You know, I'm tired of these threats of physical violence towards myself,<eos> Rufus, and now Agent Christopher.<eos> These decisions come from the top.<eos> Above you.
Could we speak in private, sir?<eos> These are trustworthy men.<eos> Say what you've come to say.<eos> We've defected because of your example, General.<eos> We'd prefer to speak only with you.
Can I get you a drink?<eos> It's a little bit early for us.<eos> Aw, this used to be more fun.<eos> Anyway, I'm sorry for all the theatrics, but meeting with this young man in public has proved detrimental to one's health lately.<eos> So Susie contacted you?
The sky. The future. Yeah.<eos> Everything.<eos> - I'm a peppermint-tea girl.<eos> -You have a good time.<eos> - I meant with you.
I cannot allow my brother or sister to end up with control over my part of the Abrasax inheritance.<eos> I want to know that when I die you will be my heir.<eos> Which brings us at last to my question.<eos> Jupiter Jones will you marry me?<eos> Pleasure doing business with you.
- I just wanted to take you to dinner!<eos> - Fine!<eos> Larsen McCredle's office.<eos> - It's Ari Gold again.<eos> - Mr. Gold, I have told you 20 times already... Mr. McCredle is unavailable to speak with you.
I introduce to you, "Sir P".<eos> We thank the company "Historical Animals" which has lent the parrot.<eos> Věra Pálková, Právo.<eos> I'd like to ask if we can put questions to the parrot directly?<eos> Could you give me Mr Vraný?
To Cardiff.<eos> - To your new waterworks.<eos> It is our great honor.<eos> - And ours.<eos> All of us at Cardiff are so fortunate to be doing business with you.
Daddy needs to talk to her.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Go back to sleep, alright?<eos> Okay.<eos> Mrs. Jensen will see you now.
Oh, good morning.<eos> Pinchus Zion, attorney at law.<eos> How can I help you?<eos> Cyrus Kinnick, looking for a Nick Wild.<eos> He's right behind you.
But I, uh...<eos> I can't honor you on this flight, because I have to... finish some important presentation prep... on some cap-down brokerage recaps that just need some tweaking.<eos> But I appreciate you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It is an honor to sit in front of you.
So maybe there's something to be said for total surveillance after all.<eos> You watch MI6 agents?<eos> We watch everyone.<eos> Please, take a seat.<eos> I'll be with you in just a moment.
- No.<eos> Oh, well, you're safe now.<eos> I think the room will be to your liking, sir.<eos> Just up here to the left, sir.<eos> There you go, after you.
Perhaps you've heard of him, he's a pirate.<eos> Oh, dear, this is not quite the store I expected.<eos> No, I suppose not those kind of toys.<eos> It's not my night.<eos> What's... what's that behind you? Oh, that?
Pressing buttons is good clean fun. Exactly!<eos> That's exactly right.<eos> See, Em?<eos> - It was nice getting to meet you ladies.<eos> - It was an honor spending time with you.
You have grown attached to them.<eos> We cannot imagine Austria without them.<eos> - I can.<eos> - Well... once the past has been put to right,<eos> I would be open to an arrangement with you.
Actually, we wanted to ask you about something, Mr. Harris.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I am conversing with these gentlemen, sir.<eos> I shall be with you in a moment.<eos> I need to talk to you about Frank Stockburn.
- You have bedrooms?<eos> - Yes.<eos> For when our members get tired. Or fortunate.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Pleasure doing business with you.
- I'm sorry. - Thank you.<eos> And, uh, just so you know, I would have done the same thing if you were white.<eos> That's good to know.<eos> Hey, Mr. King.<eos> While I got you out here, I just wanna... I just wanna talk to you for a second.
He looks like he's getting fucked right now.<eos> Come on!<eos> You better not drop me!<eos> Goddamn it!<eos> Excuse me, sir. I hate to bother you, but I need to fight you.
That is what I'm talking about!<eos> All right, run for your lives.<eos> Save yourselves. Go, go, go, go, go.<eos> Good work today, everybody.<eos> Excellent. Nice job. Hey, can I talk to you?
- Went to shit.<eos> Some civvy was there, botched the whole thing.<eos> What about Dallas?<eos> Shit.<eos> Sir! Got to talk to you.
When I saw your wife's obituary in the paper I knew I had to bring you this.<eos> It meant a lot to him.<eos> You did everything you could with Luke, Sophia.<eos> You sacrificed.<eos> I have loved spending time with you.
Because the mania got so out of control and he went so high, he's going to go just as low with the depression.<eos> It's going to be severe.<eos> It'll be about six months.<eos> We would keep him here, but the hospital just can't afford it.<eos> I suggest that he live with you for a while.
Master Ip?<eos> Yes, who's this?<eos> Kowloon Hospital.<eos> What is it?<eos> Master Tin has been badly wounded and he wants to see you .
What the hell is going on here?<eos> Dr. Walton, can you hold on for a second? - Uh, yeah.<eos> - I'll meet you downstairs.<eos> Sure.<eos> The dean needs to talk to you.
Oh, I'm sure.<eos> I'm the only one who's been working the front desk since you got in.<eos> Who were you expecting to hear from?<eos> Well, that would be none of your business.<eos> Okay. Maybe they don't want to talk to you.
You love peas, don't you?<eos> Peas are your favourite thing.<eos> Hello? - David Walsh?<eos> - Yeah. My name is Bob Hamman.<eos> You don't know me but I'd like to talk to you and I'll pay for your ticket.
You've earned it.<eos> Oh! Thank you, buddy. Thanks.<eos> Dr. Conners, welcome.<eos> Hi. How are you?<eos> Do you mind if I grab you just for a minute? To go over some things.
Look fancy, but not that fancy.<eos> WALT (V.O.) I didn't know what to expect at the interview.<eos> I didn't necessarily have a portfolio, just all these corny drawings... I had done in France during the war, of the fellows finding cooties.<eos> Mr. Disney?<eos> Yes, ma'am. Mr. Pesman will see you now.
So does this mean that I get to be paid now?<eos> Look, kid, the deal is that we have to finish the six animations before we collect.<eos> Who's going to pay for the animation?<eos> You let me worry about that.<eos> Oh, Mr. Newman! I've been trying to reach you!
First day of school. It's getting kind of late.<eos> But it's, like, 8:30.<eos> No, no, no. Actually, I gotta get going.<eos> It's a big day tomorrow.<eos> I'll walk outwith you, Mr. Peterson.
All right. Who's gonna do it?<eos> It's all you.<eos> Putting the brain on Stinky was genius.<eos> Our brain isn't in the water in that new case, our brain is right here!<eos> Hey, can I talk to you for a second, privately?
England needs a magical leader.<eos> You, sir.<eos> We must clear your path of every obstacle.<eos> Fear not, sir.<eos> I will help, I will advise, I will be with you all the way to the top.
More than most.<eos> It's my job as Mayor.<eos> And it's the kind of power that your new position affords, as well.<eos> I see.<eos> Well, Mr. Mayor, as the new Sheriff, I really look forward to working with you in the future.
It's only true if they say it's true. And they've got to say it out loud.<eos> Get me a meeting with the Commissioner.<eos> I want to sit with him, man to man, face to face.<eos> I will make him say it out loud.<eos> They don't want to talk to you.
April, we'll need to meet with you again tomorrow.<eos> I can review that right now for you if that helps.<eos> We're tabling all employees with extenuating circumstances as we've got a lot to get through today.<eos> Thank you for your time.<eos> I can't meet with you tomorrow.
I'll confirm it.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Yes, sir?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> The president is ready to see you now.
Well, well, well.<eos> We meet at last.<eos> Brown has kept you very quiet.<eos> Don't you worry, Mr Drennan.<eos> We'll look after you.
Brown has kept you very quiet.<eos> Don't you worry, Mr Drennan.<eos> We'll look after you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - We're here to look after you.
Still on the juice, then.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Your prices are outrageous.<eos> Daylight robbery.<eos> Oh, I'm so glad to see you, I was sat behind you on the train, only I think we were in the war together.
God, I remember that stew.<eos> RAMC, I presume, Dr Armstrong?<eos> That's right.<eos> Clearing stations and then hospitals in Belgium and France.<eos> Perhaps you're being interviewed as well.
Next time, just mind your own business.<eos> Li Guang, you are my younger brother.<eos> But your temper often gets the best of you.<eos> While you stood there and did nothing for us!<eos> Master Ho, I need to talk to you about the murdered girls.
It's very sad, but what has this got to do with me?<eos> You sponsored her work permit.<eos> Along with four dozen other interns who come here every summer.<eos> I'll try and get her application form. Refresh my memory.<eos> She seemed excited to be working with you.
What's this?<eos> This is a nice room, Liba.<eos> When you sin, you'll repent up here.<eos> I would get it. I like it.<eos> Liba will sort out the formalities with you.
You need to get dressed.<eos> We have to search your apartment.<eos> Would you mind if I, uh, cleaned my palette?<eos> The paints, it'll get ruined otherwise.<eos> It's just behind you there.
But every accident, properly viewed, is an opportunity, isn't it, Mr.Donovan?<eos> Well...your country refuses to recognize the German Democratic Republic.<eos> They prefer to make up stories that the GDR doesn't exist, for instance.<eos> Sorry.<eos> As a means of forcing your government's recognition of this real place, sir, in which you find yourself, the GDR, the Attorney General is happy to negotiate with you as a representative of your government for Mr.Pryor's return.
We won't be part of it.<eos> There is no deal without Pryor.<eos> We are not leaving him here.<eos> Is this your position or your government's? Sir, I'm here.<eos> I'm talking to you.
- She could be buried with a book.<eos> - We know she's not dying.<eos> - She's a fighter, is the thing.<eos> - Good for her.<eos> As weird as it feels to still be saying this, the president would like to see you at the White House.
- Amen. - Amen.<eos> Mr. Underhill.<eos> All his wealth, all his ambitions, yet here he rests.<eos> One might see a lesson in that.<eos> Before you return home, I had hoped that you and I might share a word.
Who are you?<eos> Are you Underhill?<eos> - I am.<eos> - Then I suggest you step aside, sir.<eos> We've no quarrel with you.
Good girl. Good girl.<eos> Listen, I am a little scared of dogs.<eos> Eva's all bark and no bite. Come on in.<eos> But I'm sure that's true but I'm...<eos> Oh, I'll put her away for you.
and, well, I ain't exactly the best single.<eos> Did your father ever talk to you about Germany?<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> He never stopped talking about Germany.<eos> Did he ever speak to you about the war?
What is going on?<eos> There are rumors flying like bats around here.<eos> What have you heard?<eos> Nothing from you.<eos> Are we going to McCann and am I going with you?
~ Why not?<eos> ~ There's the problem of access... WHISTLE BLOWS.. to the Club, Mr McLeod.<eos> FROM BEHIND: Off the mall!<eos> Specifically MY access.<eos> Which is why I was hoping to discuss the matter with you.
I suppose it's all my fault, then, really, isn't it?<eos> - I can't recall anything.<eos> - Can't you?<eos> Only we've a witness saying she kicked off after you called the police, wanted to have it out.<eos> So, did Deena come and talk to you?
Dr. Stanley?<eos> Yes?<eos> Mr. Bellak won't be back in his office this afternoon.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> He can't talk to you today anymore.
- Didn't I tell you to stay quiet?<eos> Just put it on.<eos> Pleasure to finally meet you, Ms. Turbay.<eos> Sit down, please.<eos> I suppose you want me to interview you?
Hello.<eos> Who are you?<eos> A friend... I am Dollar's friend.<eos> So you want to hear all about our family problems?<eos> I think he wants to talk with you, so he asked me to translate.
~ It won't end well for you both. ~ Join him, if you wish.<eos> Join him and Murray and the other traitors.<eos> I'm not going anywhere. Don't worry.<eos> That is a shame.<eos> I agree with you, though.
My name is Serge Nigani.<eos> I work at the science department at the university.<eos> I'm sorry,<eos> But... I have some information that I think would be helpful--<eos> I was burned by one of you guys before and I got into a lot of trouble for it, so please, I can't talk to you right now.
That's the road went after I came to Seoul.<eos> So... you will live like a punk?<eos> You came to me to succeed, right?<eos> You think you can do whatever I tell you?<eos> I'll follow you nicely if you lead me well.
Amphetamine freak.<eos> Bragged about it, said, well, matched your wife's account.<eos> How do you know my wife's account?<eos> This is only information, man. Shit in the air.<eos> I'm sharing with you.
Like, it's this thing, that everyone says about me, but I don't even talk that much anymore, 'cause I'm afraid to, because every time I talk, someone just tells me to shut up and then calls me a blabbermouth.<eos> But I can't make friends unless I talk to people, so it's like a catch-22.<eos> I understand.<eos> The only place I feel like I can really talk without getting jumped on is in Berdie's drama class.<eos> That's why I wanted to talk to you. Is it possible to change counselors?
- What the fuck are you talking about? - What's that have to do--?<eos> - Prick.<eos> - What the fuck? - Fuck off.<eos> Fuck you.<eos> What happened with you and my father?
As fortune would have it for Mrs. Woodhull and indeed the rest of us, the capture of Philadelphia is a victory worth celebrating, and celebrate we shall tonight.<eos> And I would be honored to escort you there as my guest.<eos> - Me?<eos> - You.<eos> - With you?
Best way to intubate.<eos> Gwen, can you hand me a 6.0 endotracheal tube?<eos> I'll place a nasal airway for dilation.<eos> Can I also get some blankets here to prop him up?<eos> We're gonna take care of you, sir.
No bleeding.<eos> Needle driver and 5.0 Vicryl to me, please.<eos> - Close her out...<eos> - Dr. Clemens, sorry to interrupt.<eos> - Jordan needs to speak with you.
Hopefully, we're back on track.<eos> Mr Crabb and I have been going through the accounts.<eos> The figures are up a little each month.<eos> Mr Towler, what are you doing up here?<eos> I need to talk to you.
How many years has it been, Gawde?<eos> 16 years sir.<eos> If you have survived your marriage of 16 years... you'll survive this too.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Sir, with you around we've got nothing to worry.
We should think about getting her admitted upstairs.<eos> OK, there you go.<eos> Hop up, and let's see about getting you a bed somewhere.<eos> No!<eos> Doctor, can I just have a word with you outside for a moment?
You caught me away from the phone.<eos> Please leave a message.<eos> Mr.Skokie,thisisChuckPalmer with the City of Modesto Robbery/Homicide division.<eos> I'm going to leave you a number, and if you could please give me a call back as soon as you can.<eos> It's very important that I speak with you.
- Yes, sir.<eos> Copy that description. All right, stay in your car, please.<eos> - Tony Gutiérrez?<eos> - Yes, sir?<eos> I have some other officers that would like to speak with you.
She has a couple of things she'd like to ask you, if that's okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Mr. Skokie, you had a good relationship with your son.<eos> You talked to him regularly.<eos> Did he ever discuss aspects of his lifestyle with you, or did you ever feel like he wasn't forthcoming with you, that he was hiding something from you?
And he looked at me like i was crazy.<eos> And i was like,<eos> "uh, you're the one who's talking to yourself."<eos> Oh. That's not funny 'cause he's missing.<eos> How long was evan with you?
Peter isn't interested in sharing custody.<eos> He's never even had him overnight.<eos> How can i look after someone who won't connect with me?<eos> Excuse me, folks. I-i'm not quite following here.<eos> Why is your son not connecting with you, sir?
Where would we find the hard drives?<eos> In a cabinet under my workbench.<eos> You'll find them in the corner, against the south wall.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> A detective will probably reach out to you if they have more questions.
You can't just raid funds that Congress appropriated for a specific use,<eos> - then use them however you want.<eos> - Clearly, I can.<eos> This is a direct challenge to Congress, Mr. President.<eos> Bob and I have agreed. Both parties will fight you on this.
You watch it work and then tell me it didn't.<eos> We're drafting a law, saying this use of the DRF is illegal.<eos> And who's going to enforce that law?<eos> We were ready to impeach one president.<eos> We'll do the same with you if necessary.
- It's all or nothing.<eos> - That's not how politics works.<eos> But it's how revolution works!<eos> How are things going?<eos> May I speak with you for a moment?
We'll surprise him.<eos> Mr Ralph, sahib...<eos> The Viceroy?<eos> Why's he coming here? Why would he do that?<eos> Lat sahib wishes to see you after so many weeks.
Look, what your uncle could really use right now is a support group.<eos> He could use the support of his doctor.<eos> And I'm here when he needs to talk to me.<eos> Okay.<eos> But he's not gonna talk to you.
1, 2, 3.<eos> Mr. Mayor.<eos> Albert.<eos> Been a while.<eos> I must say, I never expected to hear from you.
I have a plan which is no plans.<eos> You can't go to the pyramids. You can't go anywhere.<eos> You're right.<eos> Nice meeting you.<eos> Miss Olson would like to see you - when you have a moment.
I-I can do that. I can get him counseling.<eos> - Mr. Gutiérrez...<eos> - I can get him help.<eos> Your son doesn't even want to visit with you, okay?<eos> How are you going to help him if he doesn't want to talk to you?
Come.<eos> Er... George found it this morning.<eos> It's Ernest's, of course.<eos> Yes... Thank you.<eos> Oh, I was hoping to speak to you about George.
Does a gentleman's agreement not count for anything now?<eos> We've already paid for the timber.<eos> You gave Miss Webb her price.<eos> Mr Selfridge, sir.<eos> I didn't know the lady was with you.
You need to go to the Inspector.<eos> First, we track these men down.<eos> Then I'll decide what to do with you.
We're no closer to copper, so I must appeal for further investment if we're to keep blasting.<eos> But - are they not friends o' yourn?<eos> If ever they were, they're reconsidering the connection.<eos> I would that I had nothing better to do than admire the view!<eos> They'd happily swap places with you, sir.
How much did you weigh when you were 16, like 170, 180?<eos> I need to ask you to leave.<eos> Sore spot, huh?<eos> You know if you don't talk to one of us here, we'll have to ask you to accompany us downtown.<eos> Pastor Almond, we'll speak with you, but he has to go wait in the car.
Yes. Tell amber one hour.<eos> Yes.<eos> Same place.<eos> One hour.<eos> Yes! All right, I'm coming with you.
I'm, I'm sorry I'm late, it was challenging to get here.<eos> Where's Mr. Parker?<eos> With all the craziness, he had a family emergency.<eos> But I'm a licensed broker, and I know, from working with Mr. Parker, how important this deal is.<eos> So, I jumped at the chance to work with you.
Gary?<eos> You fell asleep.<eos> You got Mickey Donovan.<eos> There's a doctor in the kitchen.<eos> Mr. Finney wants to speak with you.
This is my wife, Milanka, and my son, Tomas.<eos> - How old's your son?<eos> - Four.<eos> Everything is spaceships and astronauts at the moment.<eos> They're not here with you?
I'm ready to talk, but only to your captain.<eos> I'm ready to talk.<eos> Let him go. Amos.<eos> Do it.<eos> The Captain will speak to you now.
Is it him?<eos> Per favore, signore.<eos> È proibito qui. La cappella è chiusa. LaManna, non lasciarlo uscire.<eos> Voglio parlare con lui.<eos> What did he say? He said he wants to talk to you.
- Why is that?<eos> - Pushed too hard.<eos> It can be a fault of mine.<eos> I've always admired determination in a smart young man.<eos> If Selfridge isn't interested in you and your ideas, I am.
No.<eos> But thank you, Arthur.<eos> Evening, Fraser.<eos> Have I missed supper?<eos> Mr Selfridge would like to speak with you, sir?
Mr. Malgradi won't be here for another hour. If you'd like...<eos> All right, I'll wait.<eos> Got any coffee around here?<eos> Make me happy and add a drop of cold milk!<eos> Someone wants to talk to you.
Tomorrow...<eos> No, not tomorrow.<eos> Today.<eos> Believe me, it will be better.<eos> That person wants to talk to you.
That's our descendants, Mr. Lawrence... our children.<eos> And that's on me now.<eos> If I may, sir, you're not alone.<eos> It's "we the people."<eos> And we are right here... With you... Ready.
We are having... how do you say?<eos> A... a fling.<eos> That is not how we say.<eos> A sexual affair.<eos> She is not having any affair, sexual, with you.
It's not the machines that differ, but the women operating them.<eos> And there are legions of seamstresses in the city who use machines.<eos> You and Miss Heloise have a history.<eos> And that history gives you the strongest motive for seeing her dead.<eos> I'm afraid I'm not following you.
"For though they have eyes, they will not see.<eos> For though they have ears, they will not hear."<eos> Whatever this is, the answer isn't in the Bible.<eos> Okay, doc.<eos> But the man whose death certificate you just signed is sitting right here, talking to you, and you don't wanna believe in miracles?
The coal is white and very hard, makes a clear ringing sound when struck.<eos> You've thought of everything.<eos> And after that, we'll have a little pajama party, you and I. You can be in shorties by then.<eos> Cordell is going to keep you alive for a very long time.<eos> Well, no pajama party for you, Mr. Graham. We're gonna feed you to the pigs as soon as Cordell has removed your face... in a much more civilized fashion than you just tried to remove his.
Yes, we get caught up in what we're doing... who we think we are.<eos> So... who are you, Wilson?<eos> Tonight, I'm just a man... enjoying the company of a captivating woman.<eos> I told you he's indisposed.<eos> Sir, I need to speak with you.
Nobody's ever told you it's a little... ridiculous?<eos> On the contrary... everybody loves it.<eos> In fact, Genevieve finds it very endearing.<eos> Nnnnnnh... You don't think so?<eos> Look, Genevieve is crazy about you.
Sir, a week after the incident in Baltimore,<eos> Vurugu wrestles his first match in Philadelphia.<eos> Well then, perhaps you should have a conversation with this Mr. Vurugu.<eos> - I will. - (Phone ringing)<eos> It seems somebody's insistent on speaking with you, sir.
Sounds like we're gonna get along just fine.<eos> Reed Ethington, I'd like you to meet the two gentlemen our government has sent down here to assist us in our hour of need.<eos> So, let's head over to Morrow's place.<eos> If any of 'em are dumb enough to head home, it'd have to be Chris.<eos> We'll follow you.
Francie, we should go. Okay.<eos> Thanks again for coming, everyone.<eos> It wouldn't have been the same without you.<eos> Please proceed to the docks to see off Mr. and Mrs. Douglas Grotsky.<eos> What is it with you people?
You can get away.<eos> If they asked me, I won't know anything.<eos> Let me tell you something.<eos> As long as my son is in that car... I will not stop.<eos> Wherever you go... I will be right behind you.
- They'll be here in a minute.<eos> Can't wait!<eos> There's a police station up the road right in town!<eos> My son has been kidnapped.<eos> Has anybody contacted you?
Mom again.<eos> Ruth: Hi, it's me again.<eos> Your mother. I don't know why I'm calling.<eos> I feel like such a moron leaving all these messages, begging you.<eos> I don't know. I miss you. I miss Stephanie, I miss Audrey.
That's a neat trick.<eos> You'll have to teach me how to do that.<eos> Put him back on his horse.<eos> Oh, hello.<eos> It's quite dangerous being one of you lot, isn't it?
Okay.<eos> This will do.<eos> Expedition team, do we read us?<eos> Mother saying the ion storm is getting worse.<eos> We're having a hell of time tracking you.
Yeah, that's morgado territory all right.<eos> Who's morgado?<eos> Who's morgado?<eos> Let's just say he's none of your goddamn business.<eos> - Let me come with you.
2.30 pm<eos> I decided to use empty shots.<eos> No one should be hurt by mistake.<eos> There are none left now, boys.<eos> You guys, I have had a wonderful time In planning to steal with you.
Quick, move!<eos> Come here!<eos> You little bitch. Huh? Huh?<eos> Same gun I used to kill your father.<eos> Too many fuck-ups, the both of you. Such a shame. You were two of my better employees.
- Kate?<eos> - It's Lisa.<eos> We managed to attach the cable to the top of the cage.<eos> We need to come up right now!<eos> - Is Javier with you?
Here we are.<eos> - Oh, it's old.<eos> Probably just needs...<eos> - Nobody touch it.<eos> Look, it's not that I have a problem being trapped with you ladies...
Hey! What the fuck...<eos> Quiet... Quiet, please. Shh!<eos> Thank... Shh! Hush!<eos> Thank you.<eos> So, for this morning's thought of the day, we will be discussing with you future planning.
So, don't fucking look at me!<eos> Get on your knees, all of you.<eos> - Lucy, Lucy... - Now!<eos> - Lucy, you don't have to do this, please. -I'm sorry.<eos> I don't know what happened to you.
No, matter of fact, I love country music.<eos> And I don't...<eos> I don't miss my dad as much.<eos> I mean, coming to the mine with him was all I had.<eos> But coming to the mine with you guys is just as good.
All I'm doing, Faith, dear is getting something off my chest, without getting it on yours.<eos> What you're about to hear me say may horrify you, but you will forget it.<eos> If you think about it, civilisation has always depended on a measure of elective ignorance.<eos> These drip feeds will keep the drug in your bloodstreams at exactly the right levels.<eos> Nothing that is happening to you now will stay with you for more than a few minutes.
If you think about it, civilisation has always depended on a measure of elective ignorance.<eos> These drip feeds will keep the drug in your bloodstreams at exactly the right levels.<eos> Nothing that is happening to you now will stay with you for more than a few minutes.<eos> I'm afraid that some of the memories you've had up to this point might also be corrupted.<eos> I'm going to share something with you now, something personal and of importance to me.
You son of a...<eos> Hey!<eos> -I've had it with you! -No!<eos> Back up!<eos> Someone followed you through the jump point.
It's hard enough to get that kind of money, let alone with broken legs.<eos> Fifty thousand dollars, past due.<eos> It'd be real smart for Mr. Jones to have that on him tomorrow when we call his office.<eos> No, no, no, no. Don't you dare go to his office.<eos> I'll talk to you myself.
Where are you taking him?<eos> what's going on?<eos> We're helping him.<eos> Trust me.<eos> I'm going with you.
- What are you talking about?<eos> The nurse.<eos> The woman on the radio.<eos> They'll come for them next.<eos> How many mice must drown with you?
And it still wasn't enough.<eos> Funny.<eos> If I didn't know any better, I'd think he's trying to tell us something.<eos> - All right, listen up, everybody.<eos> I know you don't wanna be here, but it seems that you are all of interest to some pretty powerful and dangerous people.
Got blasted in the face with a shotgun.<eos> By Jessica.<eos> Our Jessica?<eos> Trust me, I'd face a dragon over Jessica Jones any day.<eos> What happened between you two?
That's it.<eos> You two put 'em in place.<eos> Once we're out of the hole, hit the charge, get out.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> No, I am going down with you.
That's exciting. Great.<eos> Have you heard from Christian?<eos> Yeah.<eos> He sent me flowers. To wish me luck.<eos> Sweetheart, are you ever gonna tell me what happened between you?
No touchy.<eos> Great.<eos> Bugs.<eos> Welcome, strangers.<eos> May the light be with you.
Are you insane?<eos> A Dustie in love with my sister?<eos> I mean, besides, look at your skin.<eos> You haven't even shed yet.<eos> You have a better chance of dying in-in-in this place than anything ever happening between the two of you two.

- Come on! - What happened with Annie?<eos> - Come in.<eos> Close the door.<eos> Francisco, is this true?<eos> To hell with all of you!
I thought we were gonna have a kegger.<eos> - Well, me too. - My vote got shot down.<eos> Well, since we can't go with you on your honeymoon...<eos> 'Cause that would be weird.<eos> We thought we'd spent a night in Provence with you guys.
- You look so beautiful.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Oh, my God, are you crying too?<eos> I'm just...<eos> I'm so happy to be here with all of you.
So I get the B-team now, is that it?<eos> For your information, I've been doing this longer than Alice has.<eos> Come in, B-team.<eos> Val said you had a lead?<eos> I have The Hammer, and you will have his full cooperation.
- Sorry.<eos> - No.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Someone's still trying to kill you.<eos> Yes, and they hired The Hammer to do it, so as long as he stays on my payroll, I'm safe, unless, of course, I need to worry about whatever is going on with the two of you.
- No.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Someone's still trying to kill you.<eos> Yes, and they hired The Hammer to do it, so as long as he stays on my payroll, I'm safe, unless, of course, I need to worry about whatever is going on with the two of you.<eos> What is going on with you two? - Nothing.
Oh, she adores sweets.<eos> Let's get you some proper food and a warm bath.<eos> Thank you again.<eos> Wait.<eos> I'll come with you.
Arthur will take you half the way, then another car will take you on.<eos> It's all arranged.<eos> You're going to go and spend some time with Uncle Harry's cousin.<eos> Get some fresh air and a taste for the country.<eos> I wish I could come with you.
So it's him, George.<eos> I thought wrong of you, Doug.<eos> Your Majesty.<eos> Sylvia, we've got to get going.<eos> Well, let me come with you.
Where the hell is Justin?<eos> I don't know, Jess.<eos> You don't know?<eos> Probably just skipping first, sleeping in.<eos> Did he ride with you guys today?
But what happened to Justin?<eos> Why isn't he here?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Mr. Porter pulled him in yesterday, then he walked out of Porter's office and out of school and vanished.<eos> Is everything okay with you guys?
Yeah.<eos> Females!<eos> Male!<eos> I have concluded that this school sucks!<eos> Except for you guys.
Are you with Bryce?<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> We're hanging out at his place.<eos> Tell him to get over here!<eos> Who else is there? Is anyone else there with you?
Is everyone okay?<eos> You need to talk to Daryl about that.<eos> He wanted me to keep the whole story about you from everybody. and I did what you asked.<eos> Daryl didn't find you because of me.<eos> And what was said between you and him was said between you and him. if you want to make the trip... if you want to talk to him.
No offense to that last guy, but he could hardly handle a gun.<eos> You're getting out.<eos> Eugene, get up.<eos> We're breaking you out.<eos> No. I'm not going with you.
Get up.<eos> We're breaking you out.<eos> I'm not going with you.
Yeah.<eos> It's not just the ones I killed.<eos> I think about the people I didn't kill, too.<eos> ♪♪ We're gonna bring them back when it's all over.<eos> I-I want to go with you.
And the wall's gonna hold?<eos> It'll hold.<eos> Eugene: All points are covered.<eos> Every contingency is already met.<eos> I come armed with two barrels of the truth. A test is upon you, and I'm giving out the cheat sheet.
I'm at your disposal.<eos> Okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Take care, guys.<eos> Looking forward to working with you, all right?
No!<eos> Why?<eos> !<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> ! W-W-What is the matter with you people?
Not that family means anything!<eos> This family does.<eos> All right.<eos> Good job, champ.<eos> Um, can I talk to you kids for a second over yonder?
Geez, Mom.<eos> Your feelings are not only forgivable, they are the very meaning of life that only pre-silicon, carbon-based entities can ever grasp.<eos> - I have to call Jerry.<eos> - You do?<eos> ! What the fuck is wrong with you two?
- Okay, what's going on?<eos> - Nothing, nothing. Just the usual.<eos> - Ed's being a dick and...<eos> - Let's do it.<eos> For God's sakes, what is wrong with you two?
To being in the right place at the right time.<eos> - Yeah, right place, right time. - Right place, right time.<eos> Sure you wanna drive back to campus?<eos> You could stay here with us tonight.<eos> If I stay with you guys, it'll just hurt Mom's feelings.
Hey, sweetie.<eos> Can you wake up to get to the car?<eos> Sweetie?<eos> She's had a long day.<eos> You sure it's okay, us staying with you?
And who was that?<eos> Dar Adal.<eos> That's who got Javadi to change his story in the first place.<eos> You know, he sat right there earlier today and lied to me about this all over again, that obsequious little shit!<eos> What is it with you people?
It's ours, it must remain ours.<eos> I will ensure it.<eos> You have enough men, keep them sober and do not kill for the fun of it.<eos> No, Lord.<eos> You do me a great honour, Lord, though I wish I was going with you.
G'day... g'day, Melbourne.<eos> Thank you for the warm welcome.<eos> This isn't my first time visiting the other side of the world.<eos> Every time I'm here, it gets harder and harder to leave. Yeah!<eos> Uh... I've come to talk to you today about marriage.
I won't do it.<eos> You've all forgotten your oaths.<eos> They were given to this man... when that man was just a fiction.<eos> To hell with all of you who can't tell the difference!<eos> To hell with all of you!
Doesn't matter how.<eos> The man's responsible for his money. It's gone.<eos> What do you think the consequences should be?<eos> I'm here to make a deal.<eos> So whatever happened between you two doesn't matter.
I am the executor of your parents' estate, which means I'll be handling all matters concerning everything they left behind.<eos> What did they leave behind?<eos> Financial security.<eos> Your parents left behind an enormous fortune, which will be yours when Violet comes of age.<eos> Until then, you will be placed with the proper guardian, or guardians, as decided by myself and my fellow bankers at Mulctuary Money Management.
I got an idea. Why don't you stay for supper?<eos> Honey, I'm sure- we can talk some more. -No.<eos> I'm sure he's got other plans.<eos> As it happens, I don't.<eos> I would love to share a meal with you. Great.
And our men...<eos> Billy, I could walk out there and tell them the sky is red... and they'd believe me.<eos> That's the power you've given me.<eos> But I have to know this is over... your vendetta against Flint, your need to see him dead or departed from our story.<eos> I have to know you'll never put me to a choice between you again.
Forget it.<eos> You're accusing me of being into Tank when you and I were dating?<eos> - Seriously?<eos> - Okay, listen, I know this is strange, but you two went through a lot together.<eos> You had a really nice thing.
- What? What did he say?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> Why do you think she would be listed as a missing person?<eos> We know she was scared.<eos> We know she went through a lot of trouble to meet with you.
Hey, everyone.<eos> I don't want to spoil the night with some boring speech about the incredible year we've had, capped with J-Bak Investments cracking the top five global finance companies.<eos> Well, my guess is you're all here 'cause... you know we're taking good care of your money.<eos> How about that?<eos> I'll be honest with you.
I know sometimes I say things I shouldn't.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> I would ask the same thing.<eos> You want to know what it's like between Will and me.<eos> It's much more intense than when I visit with any of you.
Put your fucking cards down.<eos> Trust almost killed Axe Capital.<eos> And that is never gonna happen again.<eos> Things got a little too free and fucking easy around here.<eos> And to eliminate the possibility of any questionable information passing from any of you to me, all future conversations will be held in the presence of my Chief of Staff, Stephanie Reed.
I've been meaning to talk with you.
Since Julia decided to run for mayor as a "tough on crime" candidate.<eos> She never did have the best timing.<eos> Well, just be grateful about the no suspect information part.<eos> Councilwoman, is your presence here a mayoral campaign appearance or a favor to the NYPD?<eos> I just like spending quality time with all you people.
Ms. Shidke.. Come on out, everyone.<eos> What is it, Supriya?<eos> Why did you scream?<eos> - These boys are bothering us.<eos> But there is no one here except you two.
What nonsense!<eos> - Don't worry, Inspector Nalavde.<eos> I will not make the mistake of filing a complaint again.<eos> Besides..<eos> I have no hopes from you, neither does Su.
No.<eos> Uh-uh. We're not done here, Doctor.<eos> Agent Booth, Dr. Brennan, a word of advice.<eos> The person you're searching for has a pathological need for control.<eos> He, or she, will want to get as close to you as possible, to... manipulate you.
Yeah, we're all in it.<eos> It's-it's about us.<eos> Cam has something to tell you both.<eos> Yeah. Um...<eos> I haven't been completely honest with you guys, because it wasn't official, but, um...
What about your team?<eos> You owe them.<eos> I'm on more than one team.<eos> Guys.<eos> Hey, can I talk to you guys?
Not to mention the fact that Ian owned a 55% stake in their company, so he didn't need Kate's permission to sell.<eos> Ugh. What could Ian's killer possibly have accomplished by hauling his body all the way out here?<eos> Dr. Hodgins, I've been thinking about what you said about accepting things in life when they don't go your way.<eos> And even if the NFL doesn't hire me, I love being at the Jeffersonian.<eos> And working with all of you.
I'm Aubrey.<eos> If people hear I got into another fight with a director, I'll be uninsurable.<eos> My career will be over.<eos> Please, Agent Andy... Uh this has to stay between the two of us.<eos> The two of you?
Freedom has a price.<eos> I died seven years ago.<eos> Left behind a brother... a wife... a son.<eos> But the dead talk... if you listen.<eos> They're there with you... reaching out... trying to tell you something.
- No, no, you don't. You take us straight to the address right now!<eos> I-I get cigarettes.<eos> Linc, this is a setup.<eos> We're gonna grab your bag now.<eos> May peace be upon you, guys.
- I had to, you lied to me.<eos> Here's what's gonna happen.<eos> We're gonna take a nice little drive to go visit your friend Jenna.<eos> And on the way there, you're gonna tell us about how the two of you know someone with the initials A.D.<eos> I'm not going anywhere with you.
The only life that matters now is Henry.<eos> And he will kill every last one of us to protect him.<eos> There's a devil infecting this man's brain, rotting it from the inside.<eos> He has rigged this entire place to explode with all of us in it.<eos> What's the matter with you?
You can deal or, I don't know, security.<eos> You choose.<eos> You always wanted to deal in Vegas.<eos> - Yeah, but you hate Vegas. - I do.<eos> I'm not going with you.
I can't express how relieved we are that the prosecution finally realized that the charges against me were manufactured.<eos> Do you have plans to sue the state for wrongful prosecution?<eos> No.<eos> Right now, I just want to go home, spend some time with my family.<eos> Mrs. Mahoney, are you happy to put this all behind you?
No, no, no, you two dragged us into your Oedipal crap<eos> - and we've all been trying to clean it up! - You should've left!<eos> - I tried.<eos> - Well, you bailed on that plan because your boyfriend wouldn't run away with you.<eos> I was trying to protect him from you.
And he needed my help breaking out people imprisoned all over the world.<eos> Terrorists, political dissidents rogue agents...<eos> And if I did it, you and Sara, you'd go free.<eos> Your record's expunged, but... there was a rub.<eos> I wasn't allowed to have contact with any of you, including my son.
"But in return, you must take a life."<eos> show us what the tattoos mean even before the computers will, and all the people he'll be enlisting for the fight.<eos> You have to call this pay phone in France.<eos> Wait. Chicago?<eos> I thought I was going with you.
She was my patient.<eos> I should've been notified of her release.<eos> When she left the facility, she was calm, she was stable.<eos> You mean doped up?<eos> Look, whatever happened between you two, the medication had nothing to do with it.
And you tell your friends, even if they already<eos> Have a will, it's important to get it updated, Just like you did.<eos> I'll tell them.<eos> Now, you remember Francesca...<eos> She'll take care of you the rest of the way.
Simultaneously, the MCRN Karakum, dispatched by Korshunov to take delivery of your protomolecule technology was destroyed. And I gave the order.<eos> You will clean up this mess, and you will get the fuck back to work.<eos> The Expanse - 02x13<eos> - Caliban's War<eos> Well, it looks like you guys have some shit you need to figure out.
- Did you know about this?<eos> - No. But maybe this is why Dad went back to Idris.<eos> Maryse went behind my back.<eos> My fellow Shadowhunters.<eos> It's an honor to be here with you all.
Who's asking?<eos> Jace is back.<eos> Call off your men.<eos> Izzy and I will bring him back alive.<eos> One step ahead of you.
Why aren't you getting ready?<eos> This is a mistake.<eos> I'm not going through with it.<eos> That's hysterical.<eos> Whatever happened between you two, why don't you just kiss and make up?
Someone with access to the Mortal Cup.<eos> Circle Members.<eos> They released the Greater Demon to break you out of here.<eos> I thought I raised you to have common sense.<eos> If the Greater Demon wanted to free me, how would I still be here having this inane conversation with you two?
No one is doing this, ok? Ok, ok. It's all right.<eos> Heh. I forgot how stubborn you could be.<eos> Thank you for reminding me.<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> I'm gonna take care of them, disarm the mine, and I'll catch up with you.
I could read it for you if it's not too personal.<eos> No...<eos> Yeah-yeah.<eos> All right. Let's see what Miss Emma has to say.<eos> "Hey!" What is it with you kids and "hey"?
Yeah, of course.<eos> Okay.<eos> Great.<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> What's going on with you g... guys?
You know the catholics consider purgatory to be... The immediate state following physical death?<eos> Konstantin, when I kill you this time,<eos> I'm gonna make sure you're dead.<eos> When we're done, the only person you'd want to kill is yourself.<eos> I'm just saying you could've taken a big knife and cut the tension between you two. And by "tension," I mean sexual tension.
We just put out an APB on him with a shoot-to-kill order.<eos> This is going south fast.<eos> - Where's Captain?<eos> - He's in his office.<eos> Listen, has Nick contacted you?
I haven't fixed it yet, but... But I guess that doesn't matter right now.<eos> - I don't see anybody.<eos> Franco.<eos> Hey, it's Wu.<eos> Where are you? Captain ordered me not to talk to you guys.
You wanna go flat-out, the Roci can handle it, but you gotta understand, you burn like that, at some point, we're not gonna be around to enjoy the ride.<eos> What's the limit?<eos> I don't know. Maybe 15-20Gs?<eos> We could probably handle that if we're juiced to the gills, but eventually one of those little blood vessels in your brain's gonna go pop.<eos> The Roci will stay with you on auto-pilot, long as it takes.
And whenever that happens, Belters always lose.<eos> Our first priority is to protect ourselves.<eos> And that means, we're gonna take advantage of every edge we've got.<eos> Miller, I do this for you.<eos> I tell you, girls, when you're out there in the black, pulling hard 20gs, and the whole boat is vibrating underneath you, about to shake herself apart...
And then Miller wanted to give his friend a proper burial at sea.<eos> Which means that it's none of your goddamn business.<eos> We want the same thing, you know.<eos> We're on the same team.<eos> That's the thing with all of you.
So...<eos> Do you think the others have a sense about what's going on with us?<eos> I mean, Amos, in particular?<eos> We can make a public announcement, get everyone on the same page.<eos> Or take out an ad. No, it's just... I was never clear about how you two...
But I shall not be sharing that information just yet.<eos> I'm aware of how most of you feel about me, and I would have some insurance that I am not fated to go the same way as the boy and his Sentinel.<eos> No. I intend to make myself a necessary part of your plans.<eos> You selfish, sick, murdering bastard.<eos> Whatever is between you... now is not the time.
Wait. What?<eos> Richard, I was waiting out front!<eos> They want to ambush you and replace you with Big Head, but I had nothing to do with it.<eos> Again, not my call.<eos> I was ready to fight you guys, but then, on the way home, it occurred to me there might be a better way. I'm going to start my own company.
Full-color pinup to film legend to murdered.<eos> Oh, don't believe what they say about an accidental overdose.<eos> Last thing I saw from the floor of my Brentwood bungalow was a CIA spook jabbing a needle into my eyeball, lest I tell Kennedy tales unwanted.<eos> Isn't that delicious?<eos> Oh. We have no business with you.
You are pretending you cannot believe in impossible things.<eos> Are you still my puppy?<eos> No.<eos> If all of this is real, and TVs talk and hammers bleed, and if there's a world under a world...<eos> We have no business with you.
Let's do it.<eos> Some of you may know, I died.<eos> But take it from me, death is... dull... but coming back... that is something.<eos> Leave it to dying to give you a whole new perspective on life.<eos> And I would like to share that with you.
Yet.<eos> You had your chance to kill me.<eos> Stop turning us against each other.<eos> We're taking him with us.<eos> Oh, if you think I am going anywhere with you...
Not when he's beaming "H.R. Wells'".<eos> Adventures in the Multiverse" back chapter by chapter.<eos> You know what? Whatever H.R. did, you can't just come here and take him by force.<eos> Not without going through us.<eos> If I really wanted to go through you, you would all be dead.
She's only been gone for a few hours.'<eos> But I am really starting to get worried.<eos> Okay. It's just been a few hours?<eos> I'm sure she'll turn up.<eos> I'll fly from Hong Kong to Vegas and meet you both there.
Matt, look out!<eos> Go, go, go, go!<eos> It's okay.<eos> You finished your assignment.<eos> Sybil's done with all of you now.
I'm afraid so.<eos> The house is at maximum occupancy.<eos> We're looking for Damon Salvatore.<eos> Well, that's easy.<eos> He's right behind you.
Are you part of some psychic world I created?<eos> None of that matters now.<eos> All that matters is you.<eos> - Mommy! - Mommy!<eos> Oh, I missed you girls so much!
Because what you couldn't destroy, I did all on my own.<eos> Look, just call it a case of stewardess interruptus.<eos> Perhaps it was for the best.<eos> I know you don't believe that.<eos> I don't know what happened between you two. But I do know that Chloe proved herself to you.
with some Vaseline and a car battery. - What?<eos> - That was a move I call,<eos> "Gentlemen, start your engines."<eos> It's bloody brilliant.<eos> Did you and Lucifer have any intimate moments?
And you're sure there's no other way to get there?<eos> I mean... I mean, dying?<eos> Well, if anyone has a better suggestion, by all means, speak up now.<eos> Quite frankly, I'd prefer to Uber there.<eos> But... look, I am doing this with or without you.
And we'll talk.<eos> We'll talk later, yeah?<eos> How is the detective?<eos> She'll be fine.<eos> And... what about the two of you?
But I wanna be.<eos> I will be.<eos> I just...<eos> I need to finish this.<eos> I miss you boys.
I've been distant.<eos> Cold, even.<eos> Leaving you, working with them...<eos> I was trying to make things right.<eos> Just from a distance, because... Being here with you was too hard.
And I'm sick of it.<eos> Yeah, I can understand that.<eos> Aren't you supposed to tell me to see it from his point of view?<eos> Yeah, I am. But we've all done that. And it hasn't helped, has it?<eos> I've been with you both, this whole journey.
Then I shall have her.<eos> You will?<eos> There are, however, conditions.<eos> Not one spear shall belong to Eoferwic until Gisela is delivered and is my wife.<eos> Aidan shall return with you.
- Neither am I.<eos> So let's not dishonor that profession, which takes eight years of intense training, by thinking we can give medical opinions, okay?<eos> Fine, then let's just stick to facts.<eos> The homeowners came by, they didn't like what they saw.<eos> So they don't want to work with you anymore.
They're store bought!<eos> Aren't raspberries delicious?<eos> They were my favorite berry when I was your age.<eos> But we're all different ages.<eos> I want to talk to you about something.
No, no, no, no. You listen to me, little boy, and you listen very carefully.<eos> The only reason why Count Olaf hasn't torn you limb from limb is because he hasn't gotten a hold of your fortune.<eos> But you ask yourself this question, all of you:<eos> What reason would he have to keep you alive after he's got your money?<eos> What do you think will happen to you then?
That may be so, but your parents' will is very specific.<eos> He's right.<eos> There's a vigorously fixed destination your parents had in mind for you, and it is not with Count Olaf or Justice Strauss.<eos> Well... goodbye, children.<eos> I'll miss you very much.
That's just the screeching iguana clock.<eos> It's not the screeching iguana clock.<eos> It's the screeching iguana!<eos> Take the van.<eos> Make sure they follow you.
Surprise party for Alex tonight.<eos> Can you and Dawn come?<eos> Sure. Yeah.<eos> Well, don't get too excited.<eos> Is everything okay with you two?
I know. I-I know that most of the time.<eos> It's just with everything that's been going on between Charlie and me, I've been thinking about growing up without a father.<eos> And I-I don't want Luke to have that life.<eos> But it's you and Charlie.<eos> See, whatever the two of you are going through, I don't think you're gonna let that make you bad parents.
Yes, hi.<eos> I'm still here.<eos> Really?<eos> Uh, are you sure?<eos> Hi. I'm calling because we had an appointment with you guys for,
Ah. You're here to help.<eos> Because all this is so stressful for me.<eos> Is that what Jimmy told you?<eos> He's worried about you, Chuck.<eos> In spite of everything that's happened between the two of you, he... he cares.
From what I'm hearing at city hall, the mayor basically said he'd facilitate transfers out of there.<eos> I've spent the last decade working the same beat, okay?<eos> I'm not going anywhere.<eos> Yeah, that's exactly what I'm worried about.<eos> You're still riding around without a partner and you got a guy coming in who doesn't know the first thing
I'm gonna have to kick it open, the way I always have.<eos> I found a script.<eos> I want you to direct.<eos> It's about two sisters...<eos> Bette, no, I'm not going another 12 rounds with you two.
Less than six hours ago.<eos> Gable Lang... software exec... his wife, 9-year-old son, and their driver.<eos> - No bodyguard?<eos> - Killed on scene.<eos> And I'm guessing you haven't involved the FBI in all this or they'd be sitting there with you.
Yeah, well, at least cheryl's not putting on an act. Pretending she's a butterfly when really she's a wasp.<eos> For the record, the only reason i went into that closet with archie Was so that cheryl wouldn't.<eos> Oh, so you did it to protect me?<eos> Damn straight.<eos> Okay, so nothing happened between you and archie in the closet, then?
Even though it compromises my artistic integrity.<eos> Cutting to the chase, you have a slot if you want it.<eos> Veronica, thank you, but you saw what happened.<eos> We all did.<eos> Playing my songs in front of you guys is one thing, but getting back up on that stage by myself...
- Yeah. Earlier tonight, you said my dad owed you.<eos> What did you mean by that?<eos> Hey, Archie, why don't we quit while we're ahead?<eos> It's just... I mean, it's just a question.<eos> Did something happen between you two?
The rest of your life, and your mother's, will be decided by it."<eos> Hey, I was talking to Kevin.<eos> He told me that you and Chuck had some scene in the cafeteria yesterday.<eos> It wasn't a big deal.<eos> What exactly happened between you guys that night?
Nope.<eos> You're not the only one who's come looking for him.<eos> Betty...<eos> - Thank goodness. - We were gonna call you.<eos> I'm not talking to you, either of you, ever again.
So, everything, starting with FP's confession, has a few gaping holes in it.<eos> He's being used by someone with a crazy motive, for example, hiding incest.<eos> You were disgusted that Jason and Polly were dating because they were related.<eos> Nothing could be more purely Blossom than those babies.<eos> Okay, what is wrong with you people?
You almost done?<eos> Almost.<eos> Is that your boyfriend?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Everything all right with you?
Huh?<eos> Answer me.<eos> Hey, hey, hey!<eos> Hey, hey.<eos> What the hell is wrong with you?
I'm gonna check on the kids.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Where are you guys going?<eos> We're trying to find a way out of the colony.<eos> I want to come with you.
Tara.<eos> Who is that guy?<eos> Isn't that the guy from the train?<eos> - Come on.<eos> At least tell me what happened between you two.
There's a greater purpose at work.<eos> And we serve it together, whether we know it or not.<eos> We may take the steps, but the Lord of Light...<eos> For fuck's sake, will you shut your hole?<eos> Are we coming with you or not?
Absolutely.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I'll see myself out.<eos> I know we're supposed to cooperate with you people, but half the time you got your wires crossed.
- That's it.<eos> I'm sending in a black and white.<eos> Medic 274 responding.<eos> Well, about time, Williams.<eos> Where have you been?
Well, you can take it again in two years.<eos> It'll be ancient history.<eos> No, no, no, no. I'm done.<eos> You know what? The truth is I think I wanted to make captain more than I wanted to actually be one.<eos> But I'm happy where I am with you assholes.
What?<eos> I might have slashed your tire. That's shitty, but it's what I did.<eos> What I didn't do was make you beat the piss out of that kid.<eos> Who are you?<eos> What the hell is wrong with you two? Nothing.
That's... they fight over things that they can change.<eos> Or stuff they can make better.<eos> But he can't change the past any more than I can.<eos> Honey, people fight because they're in pain.<eos> You are in pain still because of what down 'tween the two of you.
Thank you for gracing us with those epic pipes.<eos> Thank you again.<eos> Well, we should probably get going, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's delightful to meet you both.
♪ I won't back down at all... ♪<eos> Even the least of us is a treasure in God's eyes.<eos> Welcome to our congregation.<eos> When you're frightened... ♪ I won't back down at all... ♪<eos> And even if you feel weak or you feel lonely, the Lord stands right beside you.
- Okay.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Maybe I can drop her off.<eos> Okay, but one of these gentlemen's gonna have to go with you, okay?
It wasn't all fairy tale after that, that's for sure.<eos> I know, but...<eos> Gene!<eos> I swear I couldn't hear anything.<eos> It just was a really good moment between you two...
- I love you.<eos> You know you have to know, all right?<eos> - We know.<eos> Come on. - Listen.<eos> I got to talk to you guys, all right?
Okay, I gotta run right now. Well, then I can assure you that will not happen.<eos> Can you hold on one second?<eos> Zach, what's going on?<eos> Just brainstorming how to achieve world domination.<eos> Seriously, though, I am stoked to sit down with you guys, and talk about strategy.
So, Daph, how'd it go today?<eos> Your session?<eos> She thinks she knows why I'm so messed up.<eos> Why?<eos> Because living with you would drive anyone insane.
I cannot fix this.<eos> I call in the morning to maintenance. They'll...<eos> Okay, yeah, yeah.<eos> Thank you, thank you.<eos> And I miss you.
But tonight, I get to invite him into the Circle for the very first time.<eos> Please make welcome Deacon Claybourne!<eos> Thank y'all so much.<eos> It's hard to explain what it means for me to be here tonight in this place that Rayna loved so much.<eos> But I'll be honest with you, I would give anything if I could be standing right there, and she could be standing right here.
Own every exploitation of every artist brand?<eos> Why not own a network?<eos> Think we can't do better than CMT?<eos> Dance girl! Woo yeah!<eos> I miss playing with you.
What the hell were you thinking?<eos> Solomon has business partners.<eos> As soon as they realize what's happened, they're gonna tear apart this bloc looking for us.<eos> We'd better go, then.<eos> And I'm coming with you.
All so I can spend eight more years as a figurehead, a... Liv puppet, taking more orders from Liv.<eos> But you love Liv. She's your sister.<eos> You don't know her like I know her!<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> I wish you would talk to me, tell me what this is all about with you two.
Look, just... Here.<eos> I-I just don't understand how you can tell everything to Olivia but nothing to me.<eos> Oh... I mean, what is it exactly with you and this sister that you never had?<eos> - Go to bed.<eos> - I want to know. I want to know what it is between the two of you, because if you are sleeping with her after calling me crazy...
I already found us the right reporter. He's here.<eos> Hello, Cyrus.<eos> It's Tuesday, it's 3:00, and I'm Fitzgerald Grant.<eos> That must mean you're watching "The Grant Report."<eos> President Reston is eager to meet with you.
Hope for the best.<eos> Prepare for the worst.<eos> Hello, America.<eos> This is A View From London with your correspondent Joe O'Hara.<eos> And I want to talk to you about two pilots.
It's intended as a show of strength, but it only goes to show his weakness if he stoops to bully girls.<eos> Perhaps the worst is yet to come.<eos> What could be worse than killing my poor Richard?<eos> Lizzie, you must not speak of it.<eos> No one must know what has passed between the two of you.
Like I said, I was just a spotter.<eos> I'll tell you whatever.<eos> Please, you just have to protect me.<eos> - Protect you from whom?<eos> - Them. They'll kill me if they know I've even talked to you.
- Is that gonna be a problem?<eos> - No, not a problem, unless you make it that way.<eos> You all didn't do nothing together, now, did you?<eos> - Oh, daddy.<eos> - Oh, come on, I'm just playing with you.
You guys hand in your resignations? We did.<eos> We are officially unemployed.<eos> I bet renard was pretty broken up to see you guys go. Yeah.<eos> We're a threat to him.<eos> Well, we better figure out how we're gonna deal with this, Because I do not plan on living down here with you guys.
I know you have to go,<eos> And that is why. It is so amazing that you've stayed here. To talk about our daughter.<eos> You are an amazing father.<eos> Okay, yeah, I just...<eos> Citizens of portland... It is with great sadness that I stand before you tonight.
Three?<eos> - Apparently, yes.<eos> - Well, congratulations!<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - Really happy for you guys.
He could've killed us, but he didn't.<eos> No, he needed you there to open the way from his side so he could cross over with you.<eos> This day was predicted from all the symbols on the cloth.<eos> We think that everything is supposed to happen today, March 24th.<eos> Wait, did he follow you here?
How very blessed we are.<eos> I wonder how Dwight will keep Christmas this year?<eos> Easy now, Williams.<eos> Merry Christmas, sweetheart.<eos> God's grace be with you.
You'd subdue by force, your old comrades and friends?<eos> Judas!<eos> You're right, my friend.<eos> Of course I've changed sides.<eos> I'm not here to defend my country, but to protect the property of my good friend George, who would like nothing better than for me to pick up arms against you.
- I have my health, right?<eos> - And did you report this theft to the security company and the LAPD?<eos> You can't file an insurance claim without a police report.<eos> And I also complained to AKV.<eos> Since a cop hit on me, I just don't bother with you guys anymore.
Since a cop hit on me, I just don't bother with you guys anymore.<eos> I reported to AKV, the police, and my brother, the judge, all of whom told me to get over it.<eos> I yelled at the alarm company.<eos> Did they not tell the police that?<eos> I filed a report with you people, and then I canceled my contract with AKV.
Nothing unusual there.<eos> Can you explain these many cash withdrawals that you made from your checking account over the last six months?<eos> And each just under the Federal reporting limit?<eos> Withdrawn in person, at your bank.<eos> Okay, listen, I haven't been completely honest with you, all right?
Pope, it's just smart.<eos> Feel like you owe her something?<eos> You pay her. I'm not paying her.<eos> I wish she'd have dropped me and Julia off at a firehouse door the day she had us.<eos> What's going on with you guys?
Mike is from Pearson Specter Litt, and he knows more about law than all of you combined.<eos> So, if Mike tells you to do something, you do it.<eos> I don't mean to question the new world order, but what is his title?<eos> Great question, Marissa.<eos> Um... senior individual in charge of you?
I just need you to sign it.<eos> Emancipation papers? Honey!<eos> What does "emancipation" mean?<eos> It means I'll be on my own.<eos> All my life, I've been taking care of myself and you guys.
I guess that means you're in the home stretch, huh?<eos> Guess I am.<eos> Look, Oliver, I know what you're thinking.<eos> But I was telling Nathan the truth.<eos> I'm not looking to come back here with these guys instead of working with you.
Seriously, Harvey, I appreciate you rolling with this thing.<eos> Especially when I had to improvise.<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> The truth is,<eos> I like getting the chance to work with you again.
Right, you talk to the social worker, I'll go see Kelly.<eos> Your son's in safe hands.<eos> That's supposed to put my mind at rest?<eos> Just give me a name, love, the man who did this to you.<eos> I got this for talking to you!
'Cause I remember, I told 'em to send me his audition tape 'cause I wanted it for, like, his actor reel, right?<eos> They told me to pound sand. Yeah.<eos> Teddy gunth!<eos> So I told them, "you listen to me right now."<eos> You send me his goddamn audition tape right now, or I'm gonna have screen actors guild on you so fast,
If you want to talk to him, I'll try and make it work, but this is our home.<eos> Sir, if I may... help us out here, okay?<eos> Grace was murdered.<eos> You knew her.<eos> She probably stood right there where you're standing at one point, and what happened to her is as bad as it gets.
So, the back pain was a sign.<eos> We could've caught this months ago.<eos> Let's focus on the fact that we caught it now.<eos> It can be treated surgically.<eos> Dr. Reese will do a neurosurgery consult with you, and then our head of neurosurgery, dr. Abrams, will come down and go over the details.
Vitals stable.<eos> Um... Blood and personality, Both type a.<eos> I'll take it from here.<eos> Thank you, jeff.<eos> Sure. So it's really over between you two?
Aida read the Darkhold.<eos> We can't risk having any of its contents in her memory. - It's too dangerous.<eos> - Makes sense, although does seem a little bit unfair to Aida, considering how many lives she just saved.<eos> First of all, that thing is not a "she" ... it's a damn robot.<eos> And second of all, what's the matter with you two chuckleheads?
- Mm. I've been inside your brain.<eos> I know what you want, or, rather... whom.<eos> See?<eos> You do know.<eos> I've seen the closeness between you.
Yes, sir.<eos> My apologies.<eos> The back door exit point's programmed to be in a city park, not some steel mill.<eos> What's going on here?<eos> Seems Madame Hydra's a step ahead of you again.
So you can bring me out here on some wild goose chase?<eos> - Daisy was only trying to help.<eos> - How?<eos> By taking me away from my kid?<eos> What the hell is wrong with you two?
Davis...<eos> We already left him.<eos> I'm sorry, but he's already dead.<eos> If you drop your guns, you can come with us.<eos> I don't suggest staying, but the Zephyr's leaving with or without you.
Claudia, stop trippin'.<eos> Come on, you don't think that happens?<eos> Maybe that's what they do at the Institute of the Higher Mind.<eos> I'm sorry, but you're my favorite actor, and you're my favorite athlete, and this is insane.<eos> Can I please get a picture with you guys?
He said someone's gonna meet us.<eos> All right, go with Mommy. What about you?<eos> What about you?<eos> No. No, no, it's all right. You go.<eos> Run, run! I'll be right behind you. Come on.
Look, could you put the gun down?<eos> It's all right. It's all right.<eos> Look, they're patrolling all over.<eos> You guys can take Campbell Pond Road as far as it goes.<eos> I called a friend, so if you guys can make it past Jackman, he's gonna meet you at the border.
Don't... I'm sorry to put you on the spot.<eos> Listen, the point of that question... is that you cannot have a clear picture of your future if you are held hostage by your past.<eos> Now here's the dirty little secret:<eos> You're free to go at any time.<eos> No one's holding you hostage but you.
- Doc.<eos> I tried being a lawman.<eos> It didn't take.<eos> This is treason.<eos> And you're a dumpster fire.
I saw Eddie Phillips at the squat.<eos> I watched him die in front of me.<eos> - Go on.<eos> - I walked in on them having an argument.<eos> Terry was pissed off that Eddie spoke to you lot.
Dad, the uh, the damage to your hand is...<eos> It's extensive. It's a punishment for helping Mon-El and Kara escape.<eos> But I would do it again, in a heartbeat.<eos> I'm so lucky you found me.<eos> I'm so lucky to be back with you two.
That's lovely.<eos> Look, so, I don't wanna believe it, but I know it was you.<eos> You know what was us?<eos> You placed the bounty on Kara's life.<eos> Did you really think that if you had her killed that I was just going to change my mind and come back with you?
So where is it now?<eos> It's still with the acolytes.<eos> I used this page from the book to track them to the place where she was reborn.<eos> That's where you'll find them.<eos> Wait, I'm going with you.
While my lawyer works on getting this mess sorted out,<eos> I'm gonna need you to step up and run the clubs in my absence.<eos> - GHOST: All right?<eos> - Oh, I already am.<eos> With you all over the news, business has been booming.
Will you marry me?<eos> Will you be my wife?<eos> I want to build out this business.<eos> And I want to take care of you.<eos> I want... I want to take care of all of you, 'cause you spent so much time taking care of me.
You're the parent.<eos> You're in charge!<eos> That's it!<eos> Do what I say!<eos> I control you!
But what about your business here?<eos> Our business is bankrupt.<eos> Why didn't you tell me?<eos> It is not your concern.<eos> - Let me come with you.
You saw what happened in dieppe.<eos> Sabine left your apartment two nights ago.<eos> With luggage and she hasn't been seen since.<eos> What happened?<eos> Answer the question. What happened was I told her I was gonna work with you.
They've stopped.<eos> Up ahead!<eos> And you shot him in the back.<eos> Rigaud knew I was working.<eos> With you. He was about to be interrogated.
Yeah, I just didn't sleep very well last night.<eos> Hey, you are gonna do great. - Okay.<eos> - All right.<eos> Everyone, please be seated.<eos> I'm so honored to be here with you all today and I am truly humbled that Tessa and Bryan asked me to help them take the next step in their life together.
Get onto the surveyors.<eos> Mr Greenhill, can you compromise at all?<eos> We will get access to that building.<eos> Maybe there's a bit of wiggle room.<eos> If you have one of our engineers with you...
Yes. I'm excited too.<eos> Your cells, for those of you that don't know, are powered by a central generator.<eos> From this generator, each block draws its allowance of power...<eos> An allowance... a very specific allowance based on personnel.<eos> Based on you.
He doesn't mind. That's why we picked him.<eos> He knows how to have fun.<eos> Mm. So what's the gossip?<eos> What really happened with Gemma Kensington?<eos> You know, her mother was just mortified. When it didn't work out between you two.
That's... not the point.<eos> Please, just...<eos> If you just listen to me, I promise you, I promise you, I will tell you the truth, okay?<eos> Whoa! Jesus, come on!<eos> What is wrong with you?
Yeah.<eos> In her skull.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I'm gonna go make myself useful.<eos> Is there something going on between the two of you that I need to care about?
Can you?<eos> No, I can't.<eos> When Quince gets out, what you think he gonna do to me?<eos> What you think he gonna do to my son?<eos> If he's out on the street, he'll come after both of you.
Fifteen years.<eos> I'm gonna kidnap Marty... get his money and kill him.<eos> With feds in town?<eos> The boys and I will be in Canada before they know what happened.<eos> I'm coming with you.
Get over here.<eos> Thought you had the afternoon shift.<eos> Gotta go to the store first.<eos> Come on over here a sec.<eos> Need to talk to you.
Pree has alley-cams?<eos> Oh, bless his little voyeur heart.<eos> Why would you bring us here if your ex was gonna kill you?<eos> Lachlan used to find me very charming.<eos> So what happened to you guys?
What the hells does that mean?<eos> We still have Hullen in our own RAC.<eos> Tonight we wipe them out once and for all.<eos> You have front-row seats to the show.<eos> In front of you, you've got everything that you need if you join the fight... the locations of all the plasma pools nearest your own RACs, a sample of the black plasma you'll use to poison that pool so these alien dickholes don't replicate, and a knife that you'll use to prove that you're all human.
There.<eos> You're no longer broadcasting.<eos> Anya... she didn't have to sacrifice herself.<eos> Let's fall back to the Marauder.<eos> - We are not going with you.
Once you reach the station, take separate transport ships out.<eos> Do not contact anyone till you're en route.<eos> Now, before you go, I just wanted to say this.<eos> One of you may have just caused your colonies their best shot at survival.<eos> I hope I'm wrong, but either way, you're gonna have to work long and hard to get past this, and I wish you luck... 'cause I'm done with you all.
Emperor Ishida?<eos> We don't know what your issue is with this ship's crew and, frankly, we don't care.<eos> This has nothing to do with us.<eos> On the contrary.<eos> It could have everything to do with you.
Why go through all the trouble?<eos> I could've just gotten into my shuttle, and leveled this place with a couple of well-placed missiles.<eos> You think about it, that would've been a best-case scenario for those workers.<eos> They get their independence, and the big bad crew of the "Raza" add to their rep.<eos> I wasn't playing you.
Warn us if they try.<eos> I'll stay here and back up the kid.<eos> The kid?<eos> Y-younger person.<eos> I'm coming with you.
I will.<eos> Okay, where to?<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - Where are we dropping you off?<eos> Actually, we were kinda hoping maybe we could stay with you guys for awhile.
- You're not Tabor.<eos> - Oh, right, the amnesia thing.<eos> Tabor told me.<eos> Adrian Maro, Tabor's former assistant.<eos> We were kinda hoping maybe we could stay with you guys for a while.
Rumor has it you're the one in charge here...<eos> Aside from our Ishida captors, that is.<eos> I look after my people as best I can.<eos> And that includes most everyone we came on board with...<eos> Except you two.
Even if we could escape, where would we go?<eos> We got contacts in the Outer Colonies, the ones that have recently declared independence.<eos> And they'd help us?<eos> They already agreed to take you in.<eos> It's a new life for you and your people, one where no one has any power over you.
At least let us free our friends from the other cargo holds.<eos> This needs to go down quick and quiet.<eos> If they discover any of us are missing, they'll enact a lockdown, and then we're all screwed.<eos> We'll handle it.<eos> She's going with you.
I'll tidy up.<eos> She adores her father.<eos> He must be a good guy.<eos> He is.<eos> How bad is it between you and him?
I have an idea.<eos> Ladies gentlemen, friends, we are not here for mere vengeance, petty victories.<eos> We are here for justice for one who greatly deserves it:<eos> Grace Abigail Mills.<eos> She was a warrior, a champion, and her life was cut short by the senseless actions of this man before you.
We wanna work for our passage.<eos> Please be advised that water systems in sector three are no longer in service.<eos> Once again, water systems in sector three are no longer in service.<eos> You're not welcome on my ship. We don't want a ride.<eos> Thanks to you.
We couldn't be less interested in that.<eos> It would need to have some kind of special angle or point of view.<eos> And who do you suggest style it?<eos> Well, we thought you would.<eos> I'll think about it and get back to you.
There's another part of the story you don't know that will answer that question.<eos> It's best if I simply hand it over to someone else to elaborate.<eos> Hi.<eos> What stands before you is a story of impossibility.<eos> And who stands before you is a humble man, trying to make sense of that story himself.
And some of them, Hell, maybe all of them, are gonna get in this thing.<eos> Foley thought you were the one that would cede the most control.<eos> A few months from now, when you and all those others are in the gubernatorial scrum, churning, gasping, drowning on dry land, you know where I'll be?<eos> Sitting in the corner, watching, jerking off.<eos> Gliding above you.
- Going?<eos> I thought we'd toast to his majesty<eos> - now that we're all...<eos> - Martin, this was a mistake.<eos> I had meant to have a separate meeting with you all concerning the army's reimbursement.
- now that we're all...<eos> - Martin, this was a mistake.<eos> I had meant to have a separate meeting with you all concerning the army's reimbursement.<eos> You mean the reimbursement we're collecting tonight?<eos> That's what I hoped to speak to you about.
We've gotta move.<eos> Congratulations, you just declared war on walker's nation.<eos> Joe, call the patrols!<eos> Watch for perimeter breaches!<eos> They could be right behind you.
Do we wait until he puts a bullet in another little zombie boy's head?<eos> Let's not all forget that I work with the police.<eos> No one's getting rid of anyone.<eos> What we need is information.<eos> Now, he won't talk to the police, but I bet he'll talk to you.
Will you fetch him, Finan?<eos> We'll be waiting in the hall.<eos> I will, Lord.<eos> The man must have a priest for each day of the year.<eos> God be with you.
This is truly a milestone in the war against evil.<eos> None of this changes the fact that you kept crucial information from me.<eos> About who you are, where you're from, when you're from, and about my daughter.<eos> And that you think there is a world in which I'm gonna let you take her anywhere near any of this.<eos> I assure you upon my honor, every one of us will be with you for every step of this journey, and Molly's safety is absolute paramount.
Take a look at this.<eos> Your young colleague had his eyes open.<eos> This man is in Pruszko as we speak.<eos> But Untersturmfuhr Edsel clearly remembers seeing him in German uniform at your promotion party in Paris.<eos> he has proof of a covert communication between you two. a double agent.
No one's going anywhere in this storm.<eos> Then we wait for it to pass.<eos> When it does, there may not be anyone left to hunt for.<eos> Hunting for someone else to kill.<eos> What's the matter with you people?
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> We can't pretend that anything is as it was before the Capitol was attacked.<eos> The very fact that I'm standing here before you as First Lady should be proof enough of that.
Awesome.<eos> Wait up.<eos> - This really is such a nice surprise.<eos> - Hi. They needed to see you.<eos> No more than I needed to see all of you.
They are Russian-made land mines, 300,000 of them, flooded the market after Russia pulled out of Afghanistan.<eos> Browning Reed bought them, legally, and used them for our Demining training.<eos> My attorney has all the import permits on file.<eos> Here's his card. Hmm.<eos> Though, I expect he'll contact you first, once he's pulled together the charges for the illegal search and seizure.
Well, let's take a look inside.<eos> Well, what if someone comes home?<eos> Or Shepherd could be expecting us to come here.<eos> It could be a trap.<eos> With you two...
Do not leave me hanging.<eos> Aren't you supposed to be on bed rest? Thinking calm thoughts, watching TV shows?<eos> Dr. Park says the baby and I are doing just fine.<eos> Thank goodness.<eos> But why don't you two keep an eye on me?
- You're lucky Dad's on the road.<eos> I'm not here to apologize to him.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - We need your help.<eos> We came to train with you, the Lumberjacksons.
- It was on the line!<eos> - No, that was in!<eos> I'm gonna tell them to take it down a notch.<eos> That was not in!<eos> Hey! What the hell is wrong with you?
In the past.<eos> I like to think I'm a time traveler.<eos> back.<eos> But all I can do is...<eos> Watch. this attachment between you.
It should be "I've done this terrible thing."<eos> Yes, it is a terrible thing, and I'm sure it's very upsetting to read.<eos> But once and for all, we can see the note is not a forgery.<eos> You're right.<eos> But why would this Captain Sham person go through so much trouble just to place you under his care?
Oh, good, then you'll have an easy time with the menu.<eos> Captain Sham's invited us all to a restaurant to talk this over.<eos> You've already spoken with Captain Sham?<eos> Yes, by some strange coincidence, he called me accidentally, trying to reach a knife store to buy a surprise for some children he knows.<eos> He was shocked to hear about Josephine's death, but overjoyed at the prospect of raising you children.
- Look.<eos> Lucky Smells Lumbermill.<eos> Aunt Josephine said it wasn't far. Come on.<eos> We don't have all day.<eos> What am I supposed to do with you?
We don't have all day.<eos> What am I supposed to do with you?<eos> You said you were going to go home and rest, but instead you steal a sailboat and push Josephine's house down a hill?<eos> I missed the prehurricane discount tickets and had to spend the night in a bed and breakfast that uses powdered eggs!<eos> I wouldn't be surprised if Captain Sham was no longer interested in serving as your guardian, even though I filled out these forms in triplicate while he boated around Lake Lachrymose looking for you on a hunch.
Which means I'll be too busy to check in on you orphans.<eos> What's our new guardian's name?<eos> Guardian?<eos> Oh, no. Good God, no.<eos> I couldn't find a single one willing to take you in.
Now it's time to swim in some deep waters.<eos> Tomorrow night, you're going to the Estate nightclub at The Scott hotel in Philadelphia to attend the post-rehearsal dinner party of a lovely young couple about to get married.<eos> You'll be assigned your mark amongst the wedding guests when you arrive.<eos> Your goal... to seduce them.<eos> You make them feel so comfortable they're willing to spend the night with you and wake up with them after.
Take me to the police morgue.<eos> He needs the cure.<eos> Now. I take the cure, and everyone I've ever known is wiped from my memory.<eos> It's time.<eos> I'm gonna miss you guys.
Did you see that?<eos> See what?<eos> There was a flash, and I saw David.<eos> I don't think that we should be here.<eos> Behind you!
You would have died with him.<eos> That's right.<eos> You forced me to change the plan!<eos> I had no choice.<eos> Do you hear yourself speak? They found out I was working with you;
There is a way out now.<eos> When this party started, that wasn't true.<eos> Make no mistake...<eos> You choose to stay and you're choosing death.<eos> If that's your decision, I'm with you all the way.
Fuck the old way!<eos> No, hate, no speech! This way. Through here.<eos> - He's the hacker?<eos> - We think so.<eos> Why won't he talk to you two?
Oh, so that's not a mistake?<eos> We spent extra cash to get that custom made.<eos> Came to me in a dream.<eos> Put it on, buddy.<eos> Let's, uh... let's get pictures with you guys and your gifts.
All that mattered is the material support itself.<eos> These airline tickets are clearly material support.<eos> Unfortunately, I agree.<eos> Your Honor.<eos> This is not... No, no. I may agree with you on the spirit, but not the letter of the law.
- That's me.<eos> - Okay. So how do we defend ourselves?<eos> We fight.<eos> It's a new civil rights.<eos> And I will march with you, my bros, until my dying breath.
Ada, no!<eos> Cancel!<eos> As the independent observer, this conversation is determined to be "not privileged."<eos> You're enjoying this.<eos> No, I'm working with you.
But the fake fight's back on.<eos> So shut it, you bigmouthed bitch and your stupid sneakers!<eos> If you don't like my shoes, you can just tell me.<eos> Hi.<eos> Can I talk to you guys about something?
- Dr. Bailey, I have surgery.<eos> If you need to say something, say it quicker!<eos> Uh, I know that Dr. Webber's spending the night in the on-call room when you're here in town.<eos> That is his choice.<eos> And I know that things between you two have been less than favorable since Dr. Minnick arrived, which is a decision that I made.
It's okay.<eos> "Inoperable" means different things to different surgeons.<eos> I-I've seen six surgeons. So I know the stages.<eos> You guys are in Stage 1. You see it, your eyes light up, you're the only ones who can tame it.<eos> Stage 2... you make a plan, a plan unlike any who have come before you.
Guys, maybe it wasn't love, all right?<eos> Dr. Avery. It's not romance we're talking about here.<eos> It was emergency sex, and they were just too damn horny to remember the parking brake.<eos> That's super cynical.<eos> What is wrong with you people?
No, that would be self-defense.<eos> What's going on?<eos> They're coming up with a set of rules.<eos> No way I'm following what he comes up with.<eos> If you guys are leaving, I'd like to join you. Why?
Kevin... he jumped in the way.<eos> It was my idea to check on him.<eos> We shouldn't have even been there.<eos> I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.<eos> And all I wanted to do after it happened was find you to make sure you were okay... because we're... we're family.
You're more than welcome to wait if you want.<eos> Sure, I'd like that.<eos> Something to drink?<eos> Uh... nah, I'm good, thanks.<eos> So how have things been between you two lately?
Master Paul Jennings, White House slave, and eventually, a freed abolitionist.<eos> And Sacagawea, Native American guide, and the real powerhouse behind the famed Lewis and Clark Expedition.<eos> It seems their exploits were legion, and described in this volume.<eos> The truest expression of Washington's dream...<eos> Okay, normally, I'd be right there with you, geeking out, Mr. Crane, but how is this gonna help Alex?
My hands are kind of tied right now.<eos> Okay, watch the hair.<eos> Listen, just act like their aunt for one day and I'll get you the money that you need, okay?<eos> And don't ruin them!<eos> So... your parents are safe and they just wanted to see if I could spend a little time with you guys while this whole thing gets sorted.
- Second, she'd think "cigarette." - It's just that they...<eos> - The-the three go together.<eos> - Okay, - okay, okay!<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I am done playing games with you people.
I hope it's okay if I call you Ichabod.<eos> (chuckles): Ah, that name... just tickles me to no end.<eos> Please.<eos> Now, if I were to say I have any idea<eos> (chuckles): wha... what in the world you're talking about, why would I discuss any of this with you?
Our next case...<eos> Sophie Hausen.<eos> Because Earl Slavitt was executed.<eos> After we proved he was innocent.<eos> Is this where I eyeball you all with concern and ask if you're okay?
It begins, it's simple.<eos> What happens is fate.<eos> Well, why go by river and not horseback?<eos> If we go with the tide it'll be faster, and to escape we tow across river.<eos> They will follow you.
Or worse, frigid.<eos> Actually she wanted me to pass along this note.<eos> You mind returning this to her?<eos> Sure.<eos> But this is officially the last note I pass between you two.
Ethan Ward is now our client?<eos> Not if it makes you guys uncomfortable.<eos> It doesn't make me uncomfortable.<eos> I'm just worried about him.<eos> I left him to work for you.
Is that what Philip wants too?<eos> We don't talk about it much.<eos> You don't agree?<eos> We'll never see eye to eye on it.<eos> How are you and Philip, otherwise?
Yeah.<eos> Me too.<eos> I'm not yet used to it.<eos> But... it's... it's very good.<eos> He want to talk with you.
You just painted a big, fat target on your back.<eos> The people these terrorists have hunted, well, they're a vicious lot.<eos> They could take out everyone in a locked room as if they were never there, and you've just said,<eos> "Hello, mates.<eos> I'm the only thing standing between you and freedom."
Okay, Lean.<eos> Come on, come on, come on, come on.<eos> Hey, hey, where's Will?<eos> I can't find him.<eos> - I thought he was with you.
Let's go to Jhansi.<eos> That's exactly what I wanted to do.<eos> But I love you too much... it weakens me.<eos> I am Sgt. Laxmi Shankar.<eos> I've been called to communicate with you in Hindi.
Do yourself a favor... leave, before I call the cops.<eos> You're denying knowing Raymond Thorpe?<eos> I never heard that name before in my life.<eos> Please.<eos> I'll admit a search of your home yielded no evidence of a link between you and Thorpe, or you might just be good at hiding it.

Like we said...<eos> "Never be part of the other person's intervention."<eos> All right, cool.<eos> Hey, guys. Thanks for coming.<eos> Something I need to talk to you about... Mom, I'll take it from here.
If this guy's a piece of shit, that's a problem.<eos> Yeah, but that's not your place to do that, Colt.<eos> Sure it is. I'm the father.<eos> Back me up here, Ab.<eos> No, this is between you two.
- Hey, Mom.<eos> - What you doing here so early?<eos> - It's not early for some people.<eos> On time is on time!<eos> I wanted to talk to you guys about something.
It's not a great idea.<eos> Hey, 1312, how's it going out there?<eos> Do death stares count as intel?<eos> 'Cause if that's the case, I'm killing it out here.<eos> How about you, 1305?
You mean this one? - Oh-ho!<eos> - Are you a Batman fan too?<eos> A fan?<eos> Hardly.<eos> Let me tell you a story that will shake you to your core.
If I don't want your front hugs, what makes you think I want your back ones?<eos> Okay. Sorry.<eos> Okay. We're done here.<eos> So you're going to let us go?<eos> Well, I asked the boss what he wanted us to do with you, but he answered in the form of a riddle.
I don't need Zen Rafael right now, okay?<eos> Who the hell goes to prison and comes out softer?<eos> It was prison. He got mellow in prison!<eos> And I knew that.<eos> I was just messing with you.
Well, I am Guthred, I'm king of Cumberland.<eos> Lord... forgive me.<eos> No, no, no!<eos> If you are here to join me, there's nothing to forgive.<eos> Brynjar's not with you?
You might not know this, but... in your absence, all Danes and Northmen in Eoferwic have either been killed or fled.<eos> Eoferwic will be mine.<eos> There will be no fight... none.<eos> Unless it's with Sigefrid and Erik.<eos> I will fight you... and I will win.
You understand that?<eos> Why don't you just tell us what the hell is going on?<eos> Again, that information is confidential.<eos> Not only am I within my rights to protect my client's interests.<eos> I could be disbarred for cooperating with you.
So please contact me at any time.<eos> So with that, I just wanted to say mahalo.<eos> It's been a honor and privilege to be working with the HPD and the Five-0 Task Force.<eos> But, what I will miss the most is... is my adopted family.<eos> And by that I mean you.
If we make a trade, do you have the juice to get us out of the bloc?<eos> Is the gauntlet here?<eos> - Course not.<eos> - Good.<eos> I want to come with you.
- Lagertha!<eos> Today marks a new dawn for kattegat.<eos> For all of us.<eos> We do not know king ragnar's fate, or whether he will ever return.<eos> You have not been ruled properly for a long time, and many things have been neglected.
Now, how should I, a Bishop of God's holy church, abandon Him now?<eos> Besides, the cellars are still stocked with some of the finest wines in Christendom!<eos> Mmm. Am I supposed to leave them to the pagans who don't know the difference between one grape and another?<eos> Let's go!<eos> May God be with you all!
We're here for you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I know you didn't mean to hurt me.<eos> I took it too far.<eos> What's wrong with you people?
It would be counterproductive to start deliberations over again with an alternate.<eos> It's a waste of everybody's time.<eos> Forcing her to stay is only putting more pressure on her to vote guilty.<eos> Your client should've thought of that before he killed two people.<eos> What is it with you guys?
About your loss?<eos> Yes.<eos> In the name of the father and of The son and of the holy spirit.<eos> Amen.<eos> The grace of our lord Jesus Christ and the love of god. And the communion of the Holy spirit be with you all.
Not that things are gonna go south, all right?<eos> Usually our plans go north.<eos> But if they do, wouldn't it be nice to have an extra guy with a gun on our side, right?<eos> Here.<eos> You know what, I should be going in there with you guys.
Nobody wants to die in their sleep.<eos> Oh, my God! No! I have a family!<eos> There you go.<eos> Only a few more minutes until your country pays for its imperialistic sins.<eos> Us? What about you?
Alas, yes.<eos> But I say, let us not judge a man by the color of his skin, but by the content of his character.<eos> To Major!<eos> Hey, hey, there's a beverage here.<eos> I'll miss you guys, too.
I am.<eos> It's all down to you now, Sarah.<eos> Please, Mum...<eos> Hey Alison, it's Mum.<eos> The kids are doing well here, but... you know, they'd love to hear from you.
Rachel wants to restart human cloning.<eos> Not to interrupt, but I... I don't think you're safe there.<eos> Rachel's people are watching the house and the school, not here.<eos> Yes. S., don't worry, alright?<eos> They think I'm with you.
- I'm in.<eos> - Great.<eos> Have fun looking like idiots, you morons.<eos> I don't really have any place to go.<eos> I mean, I came here to hang out with you guys, so...
There's a new lawman in town.<eos> - Tickets, please.<eos> - Listen, when you get to Wichita, you seek out a man named earp, okay?<eos> He's a good man.<eos> He'll take care of you.
Stop. Just...<eos> It's all right.<eos> No, it's not all right.<eos> There's something wrong with my sister.<eos> There's something wrong with both of you.
I'm glad you guys are here.<eos> What is she doing here?<eos> Is this about Atlanta NextFest?<eos> This better only be about handling what we discussed.<eos> Look, I wanted to talk to you all earlier, but I didn't really get a chance.
- Okay.<eos> Well, we'll just stand here until she's ready to talk.<eos> I'm gonna shower.<eos> Why haven't you been answering my phone calls?<eos> 'Cause I wasn't ready to talk to you.
No!<eos> Get off of her!<eos> - C, no! C! - Let her go!<eos> - Get off of me!<eos> - She don't want to go with you.
No.<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> Hey, uh, Lottie, you got a minute?<eos> If you got problems with them girls, I'm not gonna intervene.<eos> That's between you and them.
The simulations have been run.<eos> The Earth will be ours.<eos> Well, consider this a warning on the eve of war.<eos> I AM the Doctor.<eos> I am what stands between you and them.
Thank you, Doctor.<eos> But, um...<eos> I think I prefer my plan.<eos> Gentlemen!<eos> It's been a privilege, however brief, to command you.
You are fearless.<eos> Like you.<eos> We need to talk, Nicky. Yeah, we do.<eos> Yeah, okay, so...<eos> What did my dad do with you guys?
Gideon, he's not here.<eos> GPS says he is.<eos> I'm looking at him right now.<eos> I don't know what to tell you.<eos> Murphy, he is right on top of you.
But this is also good for something else... justice.<eos> Watch out, bad guys, because the feds have some new toys.<eos> They're actually hand-me-down toys from the, from the 13th, but it's, that-that's the whole point of this experiment, all right?<eos> Listen, guys, I've got to go help my cops catch some crooks.<eos> I will talk to you later.
Who is it?<eos> It's Sophie.<eos> Why didn't you call?<eos> I called Danny.<eos> I thought he was with you.
Well, a few days ago I would've been thrilled, but... now that he's a suspected terrorist, not so much. Find anything else?<eos> McGEE:<eos> It turns out Earl used Homeland resources to tap into the arena security network.<eos> That gave him access to surveillance cameras. So he could observe the team as they carry out the attack. JJ:<eos> He was recording us. Oh, this just gets better and better. Thanks to you, I missed my meeting.
Belay that order.<eos> Says who?<eos> Says the ranking member of the House Subcommittee on Counterterrorism.<eos> I want to talk to him. Her.<eos> She's standing right in front of you.
Alex!<eos> The Islamic Front... just took credit for the G20 attack.<eos> They take credit for everything.<eos> You don't get it.<eos> What happened today had nothing to do with the FBI, the CIA, or you.
If you ask any Marine, the reason we fought was to make sure we all got to come home, and we fought for the memories of those who didn't.<eos> Doc Campbell, from all the men of the 8113 and the countless Marines you've helped, our sincerest thank you.<eos> I appreciate this honor, and it is an honor, but the real praise goes out to all the strong men and women who continue to fight long after we've come home.<eos> It's those soldiers that we are indebted to, and we remember them every day.<eos> It has been the privilege of my life to serve with you.
- Attention to the award.<eos> - The Naval Attaché to the United States Embassy in Berlin and the President of the United States take pleasure in presenting the Silver Star Medal to Senior Chief Petty Officer Kevin Campbell.<eos> I appreciate this honor, and it is an honor... but the real praise goes out to all the strong men and women who continue to fight long after we've come home.<eos> It's those soldiers that we are indebted to, and we remember them every day.<eos> It has been the privilege of my life to serve with you.
Oh, 25 years.<eos> Oh, we're several years beyond that now...<eos> I wonder how Brandon and I will be doing when we're that old.<eos> Uh... when we're that experienced.<eos> Think how many evenings you'll have shared together by then.
Well, maybe not calculus.<eos> So when someone tells you that math isn't for girls, or when someone calls you a nerd, they don't know it, but they're paying you a compliment.<eos> Because, believe me, your passion for these fields will take you places more incredible than you'd ever dreamed.<eos> And for me, this is one of those places.<eos> So it is an honor to be here with you today.
Yes, ma'am.<eos> No problem.<eos> Daisy, why can't the secretary just come talk to us herself?<eos> She's 20 feet away.<eos> Believe it or not, Pilar, the secretary of state has other things to do than talk to you, lovely as you all are.
Blake, wake up.<eos> We're going back to Togo.<eos> Togo?<eos> Wait...<eos> I am so sorry that I had to leave before I got a chance to meet with you and-and see your project back in Senegal.
I told the archduke I would never give you up.<eos> - (Grunts) - Gideon! (Sobbing)<eos> Your Majesty, we have to go.<eos> I will find who did this to you.<eos> I stand before you to announce that I am blessed and honored to carry within me an heir with a claim to both the Scottish and English thrones.
We are very close personal friends.<eos> He always brings the seaweed salad.<eos> I love to chill with A-to-the-Q.<eos> - Uh, we would love to chill with A-to-the-Q.<eos> Could, uh, we celebrate with you tomorrow?
I'm being selfish here.<eos> I'm investing a lot of time and money in you, and in 17 months, 23 days, and 4 hours, I have to start all over with someone else?<eos> God knows who that's gonna be.<eos> Hello, party people!<eos> What's the matter with you two?
- No.<eos> The night was just beginning.<eos> We should really get home.<eos> That's too bad.<eos> I was really looking forward to working with you.
It's too big a risk to work with people you don't know.<eos> But it was lovely to meet you.<eos> Well, what the hell?<eos> You seem like good people.<eos> I look forward to working with you.
Have you responded to his text yet?<eos> No.<eos> We didn't do anything wrong.<eos> Then why do I feel so nervous?<eos> I'm worried I'm gonna say the wrong thing and mess things up between you two.
- We good?<eos> - Find out in a second.<eos> Come on, come on.<eos> That's your shooter.<eos> - I'm riding with you. - Okay.
You've put my press secretary and his staff in a very difficult situation.<eos> It was a leak, and it didn't come from you.<eos> I really felt this was the way to get ahead of it.<eos> This is getting ahead of it?<eos> I guarantee you her lawyers tell her to plead the Fifth now, across the board. Most importantly, where it concerns you.
Likes to keep you close while he keeps himself remote.<eos> But he disagreed with some of her positions, the money went away.<eos> Listen, don't let Jane fool you.<eos> She can seem a bit... haphazard...<eos> But once he's done with you... it's as if a switch gets turned off.
- Did you know he was gonna do this?<eos> - No.<eos> - Because this is bad, Claire. - This is very... very bad.<eos> My God!<eos> What is it with you two?
Okay. Kind of wish we didn't park so far away. Come on.<eos> ♪ And turn up the dial... ♪ It's packed in here.<eos> Easier for us to stay hidden.<eos> But too crowded if there's a problem.<eos> I should be in there with you.
That's the thing. A guy on cocaine told me I'm the talent.<eos> So what, you're just dropping us?<eos> Yeah, how could you just ditch us?<eos> All right, you know what? You guys were riding my coattails.<eos> I carried you as long as I could, but Rob Kardashian's gonna be at this thing, so I got to be at my best.
I was just wiping my face with them.<eos> Okay.<eos> Don't you see what is happening here?<eos> Nobody was sleeping with anybody.<eos> Except for you two because of that stupid punch card.
I just can't believe Trev's gone, just like that.<eos> It's so unfair.<eos> When was the last time you saw him?<eos> We had dinner Thursday.<eos> Things were good between you two?
We all lie.<eos> For instance, me-- I'm not here visiting my uncle.<eos> Oh, geez.<eos> Run, Ginger!<eos> Yeah, I'm way ahead of you, Eddie.
We have a complicated history. Mm-hmm.<eos> - you're jealous.<eos> - Nonsense.<eos> He's fossilized. You shouldn't be walking.<eos> Just tell me what happened between you two.
- Please don't tell my mom.<eos> Okay, she'll freak if she finds out.<eos> Okay, just, you...<eos> Don't move.<eos> I am not done with you two.
Squad 3, ambulance 61.<eos> Man down from unknown causes.<eos> 341 West...<eos> When I get back, we are gonna talk.<eos> We'll come with you.
No neighbors saw or heard anything until the explosion.<eos> Hey, Sarge, um, we gotta ask you about Rixton.<eos> What about him?<eos> We heard that indictments were being handed down in his old unit.<eos> What does that have to do with you?
I did this, and it's made me realize that I was blinded by luxury and comfort, but now I see that none of that matters if I don't...<eos> Brian, Brian, hold on.<eos> Looks like we've learned a lot, and my face is better.<eos> God, I'm so nervous.<eos> You sure you guys want me to play with you?
_<eos> So, now I havehaa deadline and..<eos> Oh, hey, Bruce.<eos> Where's Mom?<eos> Well, I came over to talk to you two, actually.
When you moved here, you didn't have a lot of money.<eos> How'd you get by?<eos> Well, sometimes you can get free food and Wi-Fi from the neighbors.<eos> Just know, you might have to marry one of 'em.<eos> Hey, you guys let Stuart live with you.
So give us a second.<eos> Uh, yeah. No can do.<eos> We need him now.<eos> Well, you don't get him now.<eos> What's wrong with you?
We'll be back in three hours.<eos> Gives you plenty of time to clean up.<eos> Oh, and in the meantime, can you guys move that big TV upstairs to my room?<eos> I recorded the game, and I kind of want to watch it all cozy in my bed. I...<eos> Should I come with you?
You did good, Savior.<eos> Thank you, Father.<eos> Welcome home, son.<eos> I've missed you so much.<eos> Both of you.
I am unseen, unknowable, like a rock in the river.<eos> Do you think it chance this world was so difficult for you to find, eh?<eos> But maybe we were meant to find it and meant to find you.<eos> For what purpose?<eos> I was here long before you and will be long after.
Don't show up at my house again.<eos> Looks desperate.<eos> Looking, looking, looking, looking.<eos> Bingo.<eos> Yeah, we got a ranger station a quarter mile ahead of you.
With me.<eos> We kind of work together.<eos> Wow, that's an awesome setup.<eos> Well, thanks for being us today.<eos> Hey, to pinch hit for you guys?
Been buried here for a year.<eos> Juliana did say to Dr. Reese that Austin was bragging, that this wasn't his first time.<eos> So she was telling the truth.<eos> Bad vibe out here.<eos> Yeah. I'll race you back to the city.
I barely got this assignment, and I'm not about to lose it because you can't play by the rules.<eos> Oh, you want to lecture us about playing by the rules?<eos> I didn't ask the FBI to cover up what happened at the G20, but they did.<eos> And because they did, I have a last chance to save my career.<eos> And the only pathway to do that is to follow the straight and narrow, and I can't possibly do that with you guys running off the reservation like you usually do.
Unfortunately, so are you.<eos> Look, you were right.<eos> Clay's struggling, but not with work.<eos> Only you.<eos> Whatever it is that's happening between you two, you have to stop it or, I swear, I will make your life a living hell.
Okay, well, this is all we got.<eos> - Damn it. - What?<eos> What is it?<eos> Uncle Daddy. "I need to see you and Saigon right now."<eos> I'm gonna go with you.
And what makes you think I had the Lady Frances?<eos> You lent it to Joshua Chris when you were courting him to sign with you.<eos> Oh. Where did you get that cock-and-bull story from?<eos> Joshua Chris.<eos> He might've been willing to keep your secret back then, but I got the sense from the call with him that things did not end well between you.
- Actually, I'm going home.<eos> - No, you are not.<eos> Come on. The Fairwick. Let's go.<eos> Perfect.<eos> I'll join you.
Okay. I'm gonna need to see where you found this.<eos> - If we leave right now...<eos> - There is no "we," Detective, okay?<eos> So if you don't mind, I have people back at camp that need my help.<eos> Look, I don't know what the deal is with you two, but it sounds complicated.
So then, then she said that maybe I could have a plant so she got me this itty-bitty fern in this cute little yellow pot and I forgot to... Water it!<eos> Well, what if I forget to water myself?<eos> Oh, please, Mr. "Kind of scary<eos> "but actually really nice" Batman.<eos> Please let me come with you.
Dopey?<eos> - Doc.<eos> Did you want somethin'?<eos> I wanted to get off on the right foot with you.<eos> Well, I already got the rundown of working with you guys, if that's why you're here.
Drop the gun, or I start shooting passengers, starting with Mr. Tinker here.<eos> Do it now!<eos> I'm setting it down.<eos> All right?<eos> I need everyone to put their heads down and your hands on the back of the seat in front of you.
Oh, yeah, sure, man.<eos> You guys in place?<eos> In position.<eos> I got eyes on Sam.<eos> Deeks? Well, the good news is, is Jesus is always with you.
I stand corrected, take her out.<eos> Copy that.<eos> Put us alongside the tour bus, I'll take the driver.<eos> Nell, where are you and Deeks?<eos> We are right behind you.
I don't know who you talked to, but that wasn't my mother.<eos> Beverly pointed out that I'm experiencing insecurities in my relationship with Amy, in the same way that Leonard and Penny are in their relationship.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> We're fine.<eos> Yes, you're fine as long as you have a buffer living with you to distract from your marital problems.
Check him.<eos> Pulse is strong.<eos> - Let's get him ready to go.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> ♪ - I want to come with you!
It must always, always be given.<eos> Why are you here, Teresa?<eos> My soldiers had to pull you from the jaws of my enemy.<eos> La Capitána.<eos> She would have had her fill of you.
Limburger!<eos> Limburger! Jiminy Glick.<eos> Thank you, everyone, for coming.<eos> Please take a seat.<eos> You'll notice I've placed a hat in front of each of you.
Are you okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I just... I, uh... - wasn't expecting' to see 'em so soon.<eos> And now I've got to come up with small talk here, and on the car ride to church and...<eos> If we just met 'em there, I could just give them the handshake, and the nod, and the "Peace be with you," be done.
Ressler was chasing after Reddington for years trying to put him behind bars.<eos> Agent Keen has had her life turned inside out. I sympathize.<eos> Really, I do.<eos> But we've got a political hurricane on our hands and everybody is heading to the storm cellar.<eos> And if they connect those bodies to you, main justice will cut ties and disavow.
- No.<eos> Don't tell me that...<eos> - No, no.<eos> I didn't get let go.<eos> They just... don't want me training with you two anymore.
Shoot!<eos> You guys, we just lost our reservation at Luques.<eos> - Shoot! - Shoot.<eos> No one cares about the fancy dinner.<eos> I want to party with you girls, okay?
Okay. Well, um...<eos> I could take you over there.<eos> I mean, you know, II'm sure him and Juanda want to see you.<eos> Yeah, I'd appreciate that.<eos> I'll come with you.
Who are you?<eos> I'm Atwater.<eos> This is Ruzek.<eos> - Chicago PD. - Hey.<eos> My dad told me not to talk to you guys.
Is that who you're calling right now? - And if it is?<eos> - That would be a mistake.<eos> Why's that?<eos> I mean, chances are, he's gonna give you bad advice.<eos> Like telling me not to talk to you?
'Cause you'll get arrested.<eos> As opposed to us just giving you a ride to the station and letting you answer some questions voluntarily.<eos> Listen, it's your call.<eos> And tell us about your relationship with Richie Dowd.<eos> To be honest with you, I'm not in any big hurry to revisit what happened, okay?
About what?<eos> My boyfriend went into my Facebook.<eos> Saw that Elijah had sent me a message.<eos> He told me he was out of jail.<eos> To be honest with you, I still had feelings for Elijah, and Jake figured that out.
Of course!<eos> So, listen, have you ever ridden in a fire truck?<eos> I know that I promised you my old baseball cards, but then I got thinking, and I thought, maybe I can give you a real experience instead, so as we like to say in the firehouse, let's go for a ride.<eos> Go.<eos> We'll follow you.
I have PE today.<eos> What should I do with the doll then?<eos> That is a problem you will have to deal with.<eos> The point of this is to understand the impact having a baby would have on your life.<eos> I will see you all at the end of the day to check on your dolls.
Gather around, please.<eos> And bring your glasses.<eos> I'd like to make a toaster strudel, if I may.<eos> Todd, Melissa, I just want to say I-I'm so happy for you guys. You know?<eos> You faced some tough times... we all have.
No.<eos> - I don't see him. - Steve?<eos> Yeah, go ahead, Chin.<eos> You got him? Not yet.<eos> Steve, he's right in front of you.
Did you see what Jake wrote in the sand?<eos> - No.<eos> - Camille.<eos> Yeah, crime scene photos.<eos> Way ahead of you, but you're not gonna like this.
Because I'm trying to protect all our asses, Linus.<eos> Who asked you to?<eos> And here's something, you're no genius when it comes to relationships, so just stay out of mine!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I know things between you and Amanda are...
No, y-y-you... oh. You never said it was today.<eos> I just found out myself, hon.<eos> My ride's here now.<eos> Good luck with everything, darlin'.<eos> I'm gonna miss you all.
She just attacked a newbie.<eos> She would have raped her if Franky and Boomer hadn't stopped her.<eos> You refused to put Lucy in her place and now look what's happened.<eos> You women are fucked in the head.<eos> What is wrong with you?
I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep.<eos> So, I took some hair from her brush and I had Bay and myself tested.<eos> You let us sit in that office and be ambushed.<eos> We've done extensive 12-marker testing on all three of you.<eos> It is 99.9% certain that Bay is not related to you.
- what you're saying. - Newton Phillips.<eos> Alistair Pitt.<eos> Milos Pavel Kinsky, AKA Berlin.<eos> Diane Fowler.<eos> These are all people Reddington murdered while working with you, correct?
- Couldn't see a thing.<eos> - Any witnesses?<eos> Bethan McGrellish's dad.<eos> He came over to see if we were okay.<eos> Could he have come from the car that was chasing you?
But I knew then that I had to get the fuck out of Dodge or I'd end up under a bus too.<eos> OK, has Mr Faulkes made specific threats against you?<eos> No, but he'll know. He'll find out about this.<eos> Find out about what?<eos> That I've been talking to you lot.
- I'm fine.<eos> - Don't be stupid.<eos> Stop fussing, would you?<eos> Well, stay here, then.<eos> What, with you?
- It tickles.<eos> - Really?<eos> Are you not coming, Aunt Mi-yeon?<eos> Have fun with your dad today.<eos> I'll go with you next time.
- Hey, everyone.<eos> I don't want to spoil the night with some boring speech about the incredible year we've had, capped with J-Bak Investments cracking the top five global finance companies.<eos> Well, my guess is you're all here 'cause... you know we're taking good care of your money.<eos> [cheering] How about that?<eos> I'll be honest with you.
Stephanie got a job offer in DC.<eos> She's gonna take it. Wow, um...<eos> Are you... are you gonna go with her?<eos> Maggie's looking into a transfer for me.<eos> I can't imagine not being here with you guys.
- I want your word on that, because if someone ever asks...<eos> - You have my word.<eos> - I wouldn't lie about that.<eos> - Okay, I'll go talk to her.<eos> But wait a second, Harvey, does Donna have any idea about the two of you?
What do you mean he's going to the board?<eos> - I mean he is blackmailing you with the threat of going to the board.<eos> - What?<eos> That would ruin my career.<eos> - I know, which is why you need to tell me what really happened between you and Jacob now.
Can you say yes or no for the record?<eos> Yes.<eos> Can you describe how you killed him?<eos> I don't understand why we have to keep going over this.<eos> I told somebody at the beach, and I just told a woman here before you.
These people believe you're causing their time of need!<eos> Only because they are being misled by the Church.<eos> Does one run away when someone tells lies about them?<eos> What have the Church said about the Belmonts?<eos> That you have been corrupted by dealings with the supernatural, that you mock God, that you are threat to the common good, and that evil follows wherever you go.
You're good Jews.<eos> Don't go there.<eos> It's a world on fire.<eos> Here. You'll need these to walk to Nazareth with us.<eos> Am I going to Nazareth with you?
Mastery of the sling ring is essential to the mystic arts.<eos> They allow us to travel throughout the multiverse.<eos> All you need to do is focus. Visualize.<eos> See the destination in your mind.<eos> Look beyond the world in front of you.
We fight for our loved ones, as we should.<eos> But they are not here.<eos> So, instead, let us fight for each other!<eos> Good luck.<eos> And may god be with all of you.
- Why, where are you going?<eos> - We can save him.<eos> We have to tell the Amazons.<eos> We sail at dawn.<eos> Please let me come with you.
Abby! Please, Abby.<eos> The book.<eos> Come on.<eos> Let's go!<eos> I'm not going with you guys.
- Who can afford that?<eos> All your friend said was that you were looking for a place to explore the unknown.<eos> Okay, we need to explore something a lot cheaper.<eos> There's an upstairs! Are you offended by the smell of Chinese food?<eos> I have now moved above you, and you still can't help me out.
He wasn't really Ghostbusters material.<eos> Who threw him out the window?<eos> A ghost threw him out the window.<eos> You mean like Patrick Swayze?<eos> Like, he's sitting behind you, making some pottery?
Dear brave men and women of the protection services industry,<eos> I would like to see you dance.<eos> Get it off.<eos> I can't. It won't work anymore.<eos> I control all of you.
I didn't have an answer for her... at least, not a convincing one.<eos> I've let you down.<eos> Week after week,<eos> I've been just another man that hurts by not helping.<eos> I've not had a single morning where I-I didn't wake up and... have to force my feet to the floor to face you.
Now, I thought this morning, I might read to you from fordyce's sermons to young women.<eos> What a treat.<eos> What a treat. "Chapter one, the home."<eos> We're walking to meryton to visit aunt Phillips.<eos> So long as Jane and lizzy are willing to accompany you.
"And ye came unto the sea,<eos> "and the Egyptians crowded their fathers with chariots and horsemen<eos> "to the red sea.<eos> "And when they cried unto the lord...<eos> "...he put darkness between you and the Egyptians,
Hi, everybody!<eos> Most of you knew me back in high school as<eos> Robbie Wheirdicht.<eos> I wore prescription pants every day.<eos> Twenty years ago, in this gym, I stood in front of you all naked and embarrassed.
We're gonna make that our starting point.<eos> Are you guys really gonna go camping out in those woods?<eos> Yep. That's the plan. Why?<eos> You ask 'em.<eos> Uh, we wanna go out there with you.
- Come on, we have to go.<eos> - No, I don't wanna go.<eos> Guys, we're not gonna fall for your stupid shit again!<eos> Can you just tell us what's going on?<eos> Do I look like I'm messing with you?
Why not?<eos> Daddy had to go see your baby brother Patrick.<eos> In heaven.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I'm here with you.
Peppers.<eos> - Peppers are good.<eos> - All right, darling.<eos> One day you're fighting and calling each other names, now you're giggling like a bunch of school girls.<eos> What the hell's the matter with you two?
Come on, man, you got to lead us.<eos> See you up there, Lieutenant.<eos> Good afternoon.<eos> This red mass on top of the ship, that's your target.<eos> We're gonna send a fleet of drones to go ahead of you and disable their shields.
- What's your son like?<eos> - Can you get us his autograph?<eos> How often do you see him?<eos> These days we only see each other at Thanksgiving but unfortunately... unless he had to cancel.<eos> What about you?
Well, jeez, it's been a sincere sensation.<eos> Goodbye, Brenda Bunson.<eos> Goodbye, Teresa Del Taco.<eos> So long, Bagel.<eos> Traveling with you was...
When I say Zeno, you say Tek<eos> -Zeno! Zeno! -Tek!<eos> I love this party!<eos> I love this company!<eos> And I want to work with you people!
I buy in bulk!<eos> -It's them! -Yeah.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, good eyes.<eos> God! What's that smell?<eos> I'm gonna be honest with you, I have been farting this entire time.
Too young to fear death, but just old enough to like the taste.<eos> And when they stood and overlooked the Congo River, the city laid out before them, they were like Adam, the day he created fire.<eos> Scattered the beasts into the jungle, leaving man the cities and the plains, and the valleys to do what he wanted, to take what he wanted.<eos> You are standing at a precipice.<eos> The world lies before you.
Poor Grandpa...<eos> Our first reading is from Deuteronomy 30:19.<eos> "This day I call the heavens and the earth<eos> "as a witness against you..."<eos> "...that I have set before you life and death..."
He's really getting big!<eos> - He's working on it.<eos> - I really need that HGH.<eos> He's working on it.<eos> - All right, I'll talk to you guys later. Bye.
Apology accepted.<eos> Okay.<eos> Get out of here before I use my other arm.<eos> This ain't over.<eos> Now fuck off and take Jodeci with you.
Exactly!<eos> Hey, there he is.<eos> You got blood on your pants, you know.<eos> Your license isn't even suspended, is it?<eos> You made all this up just so I'd come down here with you.
- Hey!<eos> - Calm down already, man!<eos> - Everybody knows that!<eos> - Stop it!<eos> What is the matter with you? I...
Okay.<eos> Ma, you... calm down.<eos> I do my best to pick you up.<eos> I'm just saying we could have won every game.<eos> I, uh... I'm gonna catch up with you guys later.
- What are you doing here?<eos> - Get in the car. Let's go.<eos> - No, mom's picking me up. - No, she's not.<eos> Get in the car.<eos> Well, I don't feel like getting in the car with you and her.
Mr. Barron travels with a Hollow, Enoch.<eos> Once it arrives here, we're all dead.<eos> Enoch, only Jake can see them.<eos> She means he's our only hope.<eos> It's been my privilege, to care for you all.
Those of us who are leaving.<eos> Emma...<eos> You love your grandfather.<eos> There's nothing more to explain.<eos> No, I promised Miss Peregrine that I'd look after you all and with her injured and you without a loop...
Is it bird flu?<eos> Chicken pox?<eos> Cardinal sin?<eos> No, by "thing," I mean, like, desire not to hang out.<eos> With you.
Fuck you.<eos> Once we have those account numbers,<eos> London may listen to us.<eos> Until then, they won't.<eos> You okay?
Putting in a sidewalk...<eos> You boys wouldn't recognize it now.<eos> Mind you, I doubt they'd recognize you.<eos> They hardly know me when I walk by 'em.<eos> It's like I died with you.
I really wish both of you move in here<eos> What will I do here, Adi?<eos> Rob goes to school now.<eos> So I get time to do my tasks<eos> I'm going to miss you both
Hoi Kiw!<eos> Hoi Kiw!<eos> Enjoying?<eos> Where's Jiah?<eos> She isn't with you guys?
Okay, well, have you been praying about it?<eos> - Yes, ma'am.<eos> We just need your blessing first.<eos> - Well, you're doing god's work.<eos> You let the lord be with you and all your questions are gonna be answered.
Off, off, off, off, off, off, off, off, off, off!<eos> Come on.<eos> Roll, roll. That's it. Hurry!<eos> That's it. Just roll!<eos> I'm right behind you.
I'm sorry, Sam.<eos> When I was a child, I spoke as a child.<eos> I thought and I reasoned as a child.<eos> But when I became a man, I put away childish things.<eos> Those words never meant more to me than they do right now, looking at all of you.
There it is, do you see it?<eos> That's our new life.<eos> Listen, why do you call him Ray?<eos> It is a long story.<eos> Was there something going on between you two?
See you soon, Raymond!<eos> I want to thank. You saved my life.<eos> Especially Simon.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I would not have thought, That life can be so cool. With you it is really cool here.
It's just a bigger, better racket. That's all.<eos> Keeping the money in your hands and out of the hands of people like us.<eos> All those people, the negro on whose back you went to great pains to break this country and the immigrants who came over here with nothing and worked their fingers to the fucking bone, all believed it when you told them they could get ahead.<eos> And one day, and I may not live to see it they're gonna figure it out.<eos> But I tell you what. I'd hate to fucking be you. Standing between those people and what they deserve.
I'm sorry.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Stand or fall.<eos> Together.<eos> - I stand with you.
Jesus.<eos> Jeff. Jeff, please, do something!<eos> Either you talk...<eos> Jeff, stop her please! She's a psychopath!<eos> Tim, can I just have a word with you guys for one second, please?
Okay. Here we go.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Okay! We got it. Great.<eos> - Yeah. That checks out.<eos> Well, pleasure doing business with both of you.
Georgina, welcome.<eos> Gosh, you look phenomenal and I can't even see your bra.<eos> Well, thank you.<eos> You sure know what to say to a girl.<eos> Thank you so much. I'm really excited to talk to you guys.
Now, you don't mind giving up those guns, do you?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Law and order, I say.<eos> Sheriff?<eos> Now, I must tell you that I'm more than happy to cooperate. I can't say the same thing for my compadres behind you.
Hell!<eos> The magician is dead!<eos> They are lost!<eos> - I expected you, knights.<eos> I am the daughter of Eusebius, who lies in front of you.
You have to find them!<eos> Let's look for those dogs!<eos> To death!<eos> Still here.<eos> So I belong to you.
Hi. I saw you on the TV.<eos> It was just like a movie.<eos> I was just so proud.<eos> You guys are the best.<eos> I'm right there with you. No. Not with you in Iraq, but...
- Hey, break it up! - What the hell is going' on?<eos> Fuckers didn't move when I asked them to.<eos> We got fucking work to do!<eos> I suggest you get back to it. Now.<eos> - Fuck is wrong with you?
It's non-linear.<eos> Look, we did our best, but it wasn't enough.<eos> The captain will load you up.<eos> You're lifting off in 5 minutes.<eos> Ian, Louise, it was an honor to work with you.
Not that that would make a difference to you anyway.<eos> You marry this man, it will be without my blessing. And without my money.<eos> God, the father, God, the son, God the Holy Ghost.<eos> Bless, preserve and keep you.<eos> The Lord mercifully with his favor look upon you.
Alice<eos> Hatter<eos> - Goodbye brother.<eos> - Brother goodbye.<eos> I have cherished every moment with all of you.
But a dream is not reality!<eos> And who's to say which is which?<eos> You did it Alice.<eos> The impossible thing.<eos> Not as impossible as saying goodbye to you, my friends.
"to the greater light - the Bible.<eos> "I do not ask you to take my words.<eos> "Lay Sister White to one side.<eos> "Don't quote my words until you can obey the Bible.<eos> "I exalt the precious Word before you.
..we lost our baby boy, John.<eos> I understand now the grief of King David, when he lost his child.<eos> "My son... My son, would God I had died for thee."<eos> And yet I cling to the Father's promise that "all things work together for good to them that love God."<eos> But I come before you today, January 12th 1861... ..to tell you I have been shown in vision that more States will join South Carolina in the secession, and a terrible war will result.
You keep my family and my house clean of this.<eos> Now get out.<eos> - The boy?<eos> - He's safe here.<eos> Safer than with you.
All they want from Rome is their land back.<eos> It was never their land.<eos> It belonged to you, the wealthy.<eos> You don't really believe in a return to the Age of Solomon.<eos> When the Zealots are done with us, they'll turn on you.
You have four days to get the boy back here.<eos> He won't give him up easily.<eos> But we must get him back in time, you understand?<eos> The Lord has placed a heavy burden on you.<eos> Peace be to you.
Everything will be blocked off for 5 miles.<eos> You won't get through.<eos> I can help.<eos> Come on.<eos> Can I come with you?
My name is Captain James Tiberius Kirk United Federation of Planets<eos> I'm appearing before you as a neutral representative of the Fobonane Republic.
You've got to own this. This is your fault.<eos> It's not.<eos> If anything, it's the girls' fault.<eos> They're crazy.<eos> The girls aren't the problem! You are.
We found that what you want to see safe.<eos> - We do not come without reason.<eos> - This will blow your mind.<eos> Ok, I understand that correctly?<eos> Your they have run over ... You have brought them to you and the only thing she wanted was to fuck you immediately.
- For real?<eos> - That's a cheap last meal.<eos> Also true again.<eos> If they bring us the ice, we do not give them out anyway.<eos> Listen, I understand the romantic feelings between you two, but ...
Let me ask you a question.<eos> Have you looked at my Dreamboard I posted online?<eos> My color wheel?<eos> My glam shots?<eos> Why am I going back and forth with you?
- No, don't put her...<eos> What kind of man leaves town a week before the wedding?<eos> - A detective man.<eos> - You're not a detective.<eos> I'm not gonna shout with you right now.
Okay.<eos> I came over here to apologize.<eos> - You shot me.<eos> - Well, I take it back.<eos> - Take the sorry with you and leave.
Grandma... I had to abandon you.<eos> What have I done?<eos> Grandma... I'm truly sorry.<eos> ...my instincts and I can tell you, she can not be trusted.<eos> What is wrong with you?
What have I done?<eos> Grandma... I'm truly sorry.<eos> ...my instincts and I can tell you, she can not be trusted.<eos> What is wrong with you?<eos> What's wrong with you?
Nice to meet you.<eos> Nesbit. A pleasure.<eos> Go get some glasses, Brumley.<eos> Yeah, sure thing, dude.<eos> Wait, Jay Niles isn't with you guys?
No cover and free beer.<eos> College is the fucking greatest!<eos> Hey, it's part of the scholarship.<eos> Say goodbye to your high school sweethearts, fellas.<eos> The wonderful world of college pussy is upon you.
No mercy in the villages.<eos> My parents tried to run...<eos> The world has been so caught up with what Superman can do, that... no one has asked what he should do.<eos> Let the record show that this committee holds him responsible.<eos> He'll never answer to you.
Why's it always about Max?<eos> Emily, he's fucked you over.<eos> Why can't you see that?<eos> Don't be like that, Jake.<eos> It's not a competition between you two.
Now you just tell Max and Madeline I love 'em.<eos> No, you hold tight, Chris.<eos> I'm comin' to get you, you hear me?<eos> But you're gonna need my rope.<eos> I think I'm just below you.
We had to kill a few folka back at the loony bin so we're on the lam.<eos> - We're headed to LA.<eos> - Los Angeles.<eos> Oh, my goodness!<eos> Hey, Jack, could you take me with you?
- Which one?<eos> - All of them.<eos> And within minutes...<eos> Mr. Chairman, Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen.<eos> I stand before you tonight, in my Red Star chiffon evening gown.
What, you think I put her up to this?<eos> What about the police?<eos> Are they in on this, too?<eos> No, it's all right.<eos> What about you two?
Ah!<eos> Ed!<eos> Lorraine!<eos> Ed!<eos> Your name gives me dominion over you, demon.
The High C, we called him.<eos> I shot blanks, so she moved on.<eos> I'm sorry to hear that.<eos> What a load of crap.<eos> Living with you guys is a fun idea.
It gives me a rush to wake up every day in this fantastic house with all of you loonies running around.<eos> I feel like you're my family now.<eos> Anna, how are we doing?<eos> Well, I'm happy.<eos> I'm happy with you.
But I... well...<eos> I miss you.<eos> I really do, and I know I shouldn't say it.<eos> - It's okay to say it.<eos> I can't imagine life without the two of you but I know it won't work.
I just wanna do what's best.<eos> For who?<eos> - We just want to talk to you, son.<eos> - Watch it!<eos> - I'm not going anywhere with you!
Load up! Let's go!<eos> We got them!<eos> No turning back now.<eos> All right, this one's yours.<eos> Someone say I'm coming with you?
That's a very good question, Atlas.<eos> Okay.<eos> Just follow the guards.<eos> They'll take you to my boss.<eos> Been fun playing this cat-and-mouse with you, broski.
And then we'll just celebrate, and it was all worth it in the end?<eos> I don't even really think that, either, so...<eos> It's cool.<eos> Ta-da!<eos> So happy to be working with you.
Brothers.<eos> I go to prepare a place for you.<eos> Go... into all the world and preach the gospel to all nations.<eos> You will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and all Judaea and Samaria and to the ends of the earth.<eos> And know that I will be with you.
- That's actually rather good.<eos> - It's beautiful.<eos> I may use that again.<eos> Amen.<eos> - Bye, brothers. - Peace be with you, brothers.
Jeff, I need a count. We've gotta have a count.<eos> There's no way to get a real count out here, Sully.<eos> Sully, Jeff's right.<eos> Let's get you in some dry clothes before you freeze to death.<eos> Captain, what if the Mayor and Chief Kelly come down here to meet with you?
My name is Charles Porter.<eos> I've been assigned by the National Transportation Safety Board to conduct this public hearing here today.<eos> We have a lot of material to cover.<eos> But before we listen to the cockpit voice recording...<eos> And we will be listening to it for the first time along with you, gentlemen.
You gotta know, Jess, in a couple of months all this shit's gonna go away.<eos> It's already been a couple of months, Ellie.<eos> And, today, while I was at school two girls were watching it again.<eos> God, I hate this place.<eos> I miss you guys. I miss Chicago.
Let's hear it for the fat man!<eos> Our next challenger... comes straight... from the Munich Circus.<eos> FIGHT 70<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, the only one that could take on an Angel... is the Devil himself!<eos> I give you... the amazing... the fantastic...
- Yeah, but...<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> He needs you upstairs.<eos> He needs you upstairs.<eos> Next time you go to the fringe, I want in.
I even smiled this time.<eos> Wow, Dad.<eos> Best present ever.<eos> You, sir, are an education in marital excellence.<eos> I'm really gonna miss you guys when we leave.
The Shangri Llama will see you... now.<eos> Ooh. Wonderful.<eos> So where is he?<eos> He is here.<eos> Talking to you.
A mantle passed from warrior to warrior.<eos> And now because your friend murdered my father, I also wear the mantle of king.<eos> So I ask you, as both warrior and king, how long do you think you can keep your friend safe from me?<eos> What's going to happen?<eos> The same thing that ought to happen to you.
Now, you probably won't believe this, but guess what I did today?<eos> I applied for a marriage license.<eos> I'm coming back for you in style, Minnie Ruth.<eos> Kiss Gloria for me.<eos> I miss you both so much.
You're up.<eos> If this is about my exam results...<eos> I can explain, see...<eos> It's not about your exams, Conor.<eos> We need to talk to all of you. Sit down.
What do you think?<eos> Where's Father?<eos> His cycle has ended, sweetling.<eos> But he wanted you to have this.<eos> Mother will take care of you now, and you'll have a big brother to look after you too.
Our relationship goes by no name.<eos> I have no intentions.<eos> I desire her, and I am moved by love.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> How do I know that you're not moved by vanity or curiosity?
- he offered you a purse of gold? - For saving Ariadne.<eos> And you turned it down?<eos> You know what you are?<eos> You're an idiot.<eos> I don't know why I bother with you.
Tremenda candela.<eos> "Not well at all."<eos> Maybe we should try to put off him finding out as long as possible. Lock 'em up.<eos> Are you shittin' me?<eos> When Gio finds out, he's gonna feed you to his alligator.
I can't run at you.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Mother's right. Those people Charlotte and I met at the pensione, they were all rather extraordinary.<eos> 0ur neighbor and friend, Sir Harry 0tway, has a villa in Summer Street for which he needs a tenant.<eos> - I immediately thought of you.
Excuse me.<eos> I'm going to the moon, I swear to God, I'm on my way.<eos> Hi, little gal.<eos> Damned glad to meet you, too.<eos> I heard an awful lot of good things about you, gal.
Mr Strange wrote back to say he would never employ such magic.<eos> He said - did he not, Mr Tantony? - that in meddling with English weather, we meddled with England, and in meddling with England we risked destroying the very foundations of English magic.<eos> Have you ever said such a thing?<eos> Yes, but not to these gentleman.<eos> Sir, I am Jonathan Strange and I've never heard of you before today.
Mom, Dad, this is Kara.<eos> My cousin? Your niece?<eos> Mr. Kent, Mrs. Kent.<eos> It's so nice to finally meet you.<eos> I've heard so much about you both.
I haven't forgotten.<eos> You were only ten years old.<eos> Antoine. I knew it was him.<eos> You were both so kind, so generous to me.<eos> I think of you often...
No biggie. Anyway, Lila moved in.<eos> We had our problems... but we both wanted love so badly, we turned a blind eye.<eos> Like the first time I brought Lila to meet my parents.<eos> It's lovely to finally meet you, Mr. and Mrs. Bronfman.<eos> Nathans told me so much about you. All good things, of course.
See you tonight.<eos> - All right. She can join us.<eos> - l don't think she's free.<eos> Sure I am. I won't impose, but I'd love to.<eos> I've heard a lot about you.
Your husband was the writer I always measured myself against.<eos> And I always came up short.<eos> Well... won me over with a card.<eos> I'm afraid I wasn't the greatest prize.<eos> Well, he talked about you.
Mr. jt used to get 25,000 to breed him on account of the stakes winning.<eos> He comes from a long line of breeders and derby cup winners.<eos> It's a damn shame.<eos> Why isn't anyone breeding to him now?<eos> Ma'am, they're waiting for you to go under, so they can buy monarch outright.
We could use the money.<eos> Not if it belongs to someone else.<eos> So... let's find out.<eos> Benjamin Jones, I'd like you to meet my supervisor, Agent Justine Diaz.<eos> Agent Dao speaks very highly of you, Agent Diaz.
Look how his story's ending.<eos> Are you threatening to ruin my son's reputation?<eos> Your son's reputation is already ruined.<eos> And his story will no doubt end with a heart attack in prison or a bullet to his head in a winter's field.<eos> No, Mrs. Persikof, I'm talking about you.
And for as long as he is chained to this place, then I am as well.<eos> I wonder, ma'am, if he might want you to leave.<eos> Especially... when he learns of your... current state of being.<eos> I beg your pardon, ma'am, but seeing what I see in your service...<eos> I fear there are things I may know about you that even the governor does not yet know.
See you.<eos> ♪ 'Cause it ain't for you, no, it's all for me ♪<eos> ♪ Had a lot of people say they'd try to help ♪<eos> ♪ But they don't know the story, they just try to... ♪<eos> I've heard a lot about you.
He told me so... ten days before he supposedly threw himself out of an 80th-story window?<eos> I had just told him... that it was over.<eos> That I was leaving Chicago with my family to give my marriage a second chance.<eos> I... I talked to my father almost every day.<eos> How... how come I never even heard of you? I don't know.
Your work has a certain energy.<eos> I'm glad you like it... but I'm afraid I know nothing about your husband or any forged painting.<eos> Do you know who I am?<eos> I'm Georgina Clios... of the Clios Foundation.<eos> I've heard of you, yes.
Kady locked me up for a good reason.<eos> I should feel terrible about what I did.<eos> But I don't.<eos> I just think it's terrible, and I think I would've never done it if I were me.<eos> One thing I've learned about you, Ms. Wicker, is that you are a searcher.
You're safe.<eos> Are you Mrs. Brossette?<eos> Amelia?<eos> Yes.<eos> Your husband's gonna be very happy to see you.
Come on.<eos> Excuse me, are you Sergeant Trudy Platt?<eos> Yeah, that's me.<eos> I'm Nicole Silver, Kim Burgess' sister.<eos> I've heard a lot about you.
I was ten yards back when I heard the first shot.<eos> And as my eyes crossed the President's car...<eos> Mrs. Kennedy...<eos> Keep going.<eos> I had to get to you, put myself between you, the President, and the shooter.
Not yet.<eos> Hit.<eos> Go higher. I'll get a better shot.<eos> General!<eos> It's up to you now!
That's what we did.<eos> Do you know what they told us?<eos> We talked to Kelly Campbell, because they were close.<eos> They even hinted that David Ghantt felt something for you.<eos> I was in love with you.
It's up for sale. That's why I'm here.<eos> I saw your father passed away.<eos> One less bastard in the world.<eos> You should start packing your bags.<eos> I saw all the shows on TV about you and your dad.
Yeah, people thought that a lot when we were younger.<eos> - Are you close?<eos> - Occasionally.<eos> So when did you see my parents last?<eos> I only asked because they never talked about you.
It's impossible.<eos> But he sat up and spoke, right?<eos> Why not possible?<eos> The seizure was a fluke, a muscle spasm maybe, a brief return to apparent consciousness.<eos> If you're waiting for him to wake up and give you a statement, I wouldn't hold your breath.
Mother lived to 101.<eos> Miss winters, one moment!<eos> Miss winters.<eos> Cissy rang the lady magazine in London to inquire about your follow-up article.<eos> And they know nothing about it, or you.
A somehow brutal assault that took place at the Crispus Attucks Houses didn't make the news.<eos> Even stranger was the millions of dollars in cash found on the premises in your office.<eos> There's some people on the scene even describe a man who, under a barrage of gunfire, managed to beat down a number of criminals, some of whom may have worked for your family.<eos> So you can see how it might be difficult to decipher which Harlem you stand for.<eos> Despite these unwarranted attacks on my character, I have always tried to make clear what I want... which I can't say for you, Thembi.
Laura, this is Michelle Robinson, one of our more tenacious associates.<eos> Michelle, this is my wife Laura.<eos> So pleased to make your acquaintance.<eos> Likewise. Likewise.<eos> I think Avery mentions you at least a dozen times a day.
She's as beautiful as everybody says.<eos> Count Rostov, you must introduce me to your lovely daughters.<eos> Of course. Here's Natasha, and this is my niece, Sonya.<eos> I'm so happy to meet you.<eos> My husband has talked of you often.
I see that. Why's he doing it in his bedroom?<eos> Because I confined him to his bed.<eos> Confined him?<eos> He was fine a few hours ago.<eos> He collapsed after you left.
And it's gonna take leaders to save it.<eos> That means you.<eos> That is why I have been trying to get you to stand up and share your gift with the class.<eos> But every time, you take the easy way out.<eos> Well, luckily for you, I'm probably not gonna be in school next year.
We have credible information implicating members of the Arena Club in a conspiracy that involves numerous murders and experimental work in a highly dangerous substance.<eos> There is no legitimate reason to prevent the SSR enforcing the law, even on those who believe they are above it.<eos> How are you enjoying your vacation, Agent Carter?<eos> Vigorously.<eos> Jack Thompson thinks very highly of you.
Undergoing repairs.<eos> I'm here to buy a little more time to finish up.<eos> Vernon insists on having it up and running before we deliver it.<eos> To impress me. To ruin you.<eos> He plans to use the gamma cannon on you, put things back the way they were.
- Hey, don't get up, love.<eos> I'll drag him out for you.<eos> Vera, isn't it?<eos> It's lovely to finally meet you, you being Aiden's work wife<eos> He speaks very highly of you.
"Baby loves bass?"<eos> One kick on your base will knock sense into you.<eos> Madam, I want to clear the air.<eos> I'm a straightforward guy. I speak from the heart.<eos> I've fallen in love with you.
--Am I allowed to say "special"?<eos> No, she's not special.<eos> Well, she is to me.<eos> -Mmm. -But not euphemistically.<eos> She's a fan and whenever she sees you, she freaks out.
Can I help you?<eos> - Are you Dorothy?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I'm Catherine Chandler, Agent Chandler.<eos> Oh, right, Deputy Secretary told me about you.
Mama, this is Marcellus, free man I told you about.<eos> I'm not sure which one of y'all is the bad influence.<eos> I'm not sure anyone has much sway over your boy.<eos> Seems like his spark can dazzle anyone.<eos> Now it's obvious he gets that from you, which makes his daddy a lucky man.
Silas picked me up some meat scraps.<eos> You couldn't be a darlin' and go and fetch them for me, could ya?<eos> Oh, well, almost got me coat off, didn't I?<eos> Enjoy your pie, Inspector.<eos> - It might have been better if he was here with you.
What a funny word.<eos> Have you seen Mr Grove?<eos> Briefly, yes.<eos> Still sore?<eos> They still talk about you in the store.
No, Vincent, it's too late.<eos> She's gone.<eos> No offense, I had to check you out.<eos> I understand, I would've done the same thing.<eos> Although your superior did seem surprised to hear that you were out here.
But I saw him embrace you.<eos> You have a brother, do you not?<eos> Do you and he never embrace?<eos> We used to. Once.<eos> Why did he say nothing to me about you?
I hardly know what to think.<eos> You speak words of the most tender kind only to recant them a day later, and ever since then you've behaved with an aloofness that borders on disdain.<eos> - Just what am I supposed to think?<eos> - Can't you see I am possessed by you?<eos> My waking thoughts, my sleeping thoughts, are only of you.
When James comes, pray excuse me<eos> I cannot face both of them together!<eos> My dear, this is James... my son.<eos> Good day t'ye, ma'am!<eos> I've heard a deal of good about you!
Coming!<eos> You must be Mrs. St. Patrick.<eos> Oh, and you must be Miss Bassett.<eos> Oh, call me Tasha.<eos> James has said so much about you.
She fabricated a charge against an innocent businessman to pressure my secretary into giving false testimony against me.<eos> Your Honor, it's standard practice to find leverage against a vital witness.<eos> Oh, is it also standard practice to have a federal marshal rough me up in a holding cell?<eos> Ms. Gibbs, if I find out there's an abuse of power here,<eos> I will be switching my focus to you.
Perjuring yourself is the same as taking the Fifth, as far as your future is concerned.<eos> What the hell does that mean?<eos> I'm saying that someday you're going to face the character and fitness committee of the Bar, and I seriously doubt they're going to admit somebody who did that.<eos> Are you trying to intimidate a witness?<eos> Because yes, someday I will face that committee, but tomorrow they're going to be hearing about you.
Talk to Agent Mundo, Agent Krumitz-- they can vouch for me!<eos> You're gonna have to talk to me.<eos> Oh, you're Deputy Director Ryan.<eos> It's a pleasure to meet you.<eos> I've heard great things about you.
WOMAN: Madam President.<eos> This is Connie DiBenedetto of Oregon.<eos> She's the chairman of the Gay and Lesbian Caucus.<eos> Actually, she's the only member of the Gay and Lesbian Caucus.<eos> I'd like to take just a moment of your time to talk to you about your environmental policy.
Reckon you need somewhere to stay.<eos> You offering me bed and board again, Annie Quaintain?<eos> There's things we need to talk about.<eos> It's not your business.<eos> Charles still doesn't know about you and Johnny.
I have to earn my position.<eos> Sir Robert Peel will be Prime Minister one day.<eos> You're not in danger from a harmless flirtation with a married woman.<eos> I wanted to tell you I will be going back to Coburg shortly.<eos> I find myself thinking about you when I'm at my sugar work.
At least we know she's got Internet.<eos> I'll run this through a translator.<eos> "My dear Miss Ayyad:<eos> "It is strange to hear from you, "like a message from another lifetime.<eos> "You'll be surprised to hear that I think of you often.
- Billy Soto.<eos> - So sorry for your loss.<eos> - Laura Diamond.<eos> - Ah, Detective Diamond.<eos> Nancy rarely talked about work, but she sure did mention you.
He's gone up to change.<eos> He's going with you, then?<eos> I'm glad.<eos> I wonder if I might take advantage of his absence?<eos> You see, I have thought about you while I've been in London.
Er, Mrs Wilson?<eos> Janet...<eos> Janet King.<eos> Yes, I know.<eos> I was reading about you this morning.
Susie, we really think this will help.<eos> Don't you want this to be over?<eos> We've been through enough. You know, people think that we're in a gang or that we're terrorists.<eos> Elaheh is getting abused on the street...<eos> This is a chance to change people's minds - about you, about Todd.
Should I continue to have the deputies hold them, too, or... Or let them go?<eos> Uh, captain, I can't believe I'm about to say this. Uh, but according to the rules...<eos> Uh, written by you... - I know.<eos> I used my firearm, so I have to wait until force investigation interviews me before I can actively continue with this case.<eos> Yes, but that doesn't mean that we can't talk about it in front of you or you ask questions if you want.
But the only way that can have a chance of happening is for someone without a vested interest to come in.<eos> Let the chips fall where they may.<eos> The chips never fall well for the one who has to clean up the mess.<eos> I think you're wrong there, Sondra.<eos> If you see this all the way to the end, reasonable people will think the better of you for it.
But it did help us work up a theory.<eos> And we think that your husband targeted you for your money.<eos> It seems that he was passing himself off as a Dr. Rollins ever since Charlotte DiLaurentis was admitted to Welby.<eos> All of it, just so that he could...<eos> After you were incapacitated in the psychiatric facility, he took off.
It's very strange.<eos> She reckons Milly Davis opened a letter that...<eos> Sergeant, this is Mrs. Nordmann.<eos> Nordmann?<eos> Yes. I've heard about you.
Now as a result of these charges, he's been moved once again to his seventh foster home.<eos> Your Honor, I ask that you censure the prosecution for this rude display of whispering!<eos> My apologies, Judge, but I just, uh, found out that the juvenile here is represented by an unlicensed lawyer.<eos> Mr. Millstone is one of my law students I've been supervising.<eos> Oh, I was talking about you, Ms. Keating.
One, two, three, shoot!<eos> - I'm so sorry. - Save it.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Look at that trouser snake!<eos> Uh, I probably shouldn't be on HumpR in front of you.
And with a little nudge, Zoe would attribute any physical evidence found to him and not you.<eos> Teri felt responsible for the whole chain of events.<eos> So to protect you and to leave your children with at least one parent not in prison, she tried to take the blame for both crimes.<eos> Fortunately for them, we understand they have very loving grandparents.<eos> Unfortunately for you, when lab work is done right, without bias, without assumption, it really does tend to convince a jury of a killer's guilt.
You did. You just admitted that.<eos> So I just wanted to ask what ticked you off that night?<eos> I mean how would it matter if you slept with one more guy'? What?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> That on the night of March the first this is exactly what Rajvir Singh and his friends would have naturally presumed about you.
Have I done something wrong?<eos> No, not at all.<eos> Uh, we've been following an outbreak of a parasite infestation.<eos> We have reason to believe you can help us.<eos> We ask that you let the CDC conduct a quick, completely painless scan.
It gives me leverage in silencing her.<eos> Please... just between us.<eos> Thanks for this.<eos> It helps to know.<eos> She gave me the goods on you.
Sorry. Is there a reason for this?<eos> I had the city blokes check up on Bert Ford's missus.<eos> Interesting.<eos> Yes? Says she never trusted you.<eos> Reckoned she wouldn't put anything past you.
Elizabeth, how lovely to see you.<eos> We were concerned about your health.<eos> Rumors of my infirmity are greatly exaggerated.<eos> Prime Minister, my mother.<eos> Pattie has often spoken of you.
My doctor put me on bed rest, but I developed preeclampsia and went into labor at 21 weeks.<eos> Max was born a micro premie with severe cerebral palsy.<eos> He'll never talk or walk, and...<eos> I feed him through a hole in his stomach.<eos> And you blame the drug they tested on you?
True, but people who go missing from Coal Hill have a distressing tendency to stay that way, don't you find?<eos> I don't know, I've only been here a few months.<eos> Don't listen to an old gossip like me but I particularly wanted to meet you, Miss Quill?<eos> Me?<eos> - The governors speak highly of you. - The governors?
Just stay right here, and we'll get an ambulance, okay?<eos> Please!<eos> Please! Get me out of this hellhole!<eos> - Okay, okay. - Get me out of this hell!<eos> All right, all right, we got you, we got you.
Therefore, our rescue team feels using a 2-track method will be the fastest way to carry out the rescue.<eos> Our government will do its best.<eos> This is Lee Jeong Su's wife.<eos> Aigoo. Aigoo.<eos> I will rely on you. I will rely on you.
Well, what do you think?<eos> I don't know, but now that you mention it...<eos> Yes?<eos> I was over there for coffee last week, and when I went to get the sugar all she had were those little packets that you get in restaurants.<eos> Is it possible Mrs. Barlow might feel pressure to keep up appearances with you?
He didn't blow up the Capitol.<eos> That's exactly why we need you to get him to admit that as soon as possible.<eos> Governor, thank you for taking the time.<eos> I asked my wife to join us because of her immigration-law expertise.<eos> Ah, yes, I saw Sunday's "20/20" piece on you.
Can I help you?<eos> From dispatch.<eos> I don't have a telegram. But I noticed that the mail woman had this letter for you.<eos> I knew you were waiting.<eos> I'm always here for you.
Sure.<eos> I spent a lot of time with him.<eos> At the end, in particular.<eos> I know that you two, you weren't always close.<eos> If you can hear him talk about you, he was..
Mr Grey, your next meeting is in the conference room.<eos> Cancel it please, we're not finished here.<eos> Yes sir.<eos> No I um... I can go.<eos> - Its fine. - I would like to know more about you.
I wouldn't normally do this. But...<eos> But I saw you checked out all these books on ghosts and the supernatural and I wondered whether it had anything to do with your experience here at the house.<eos> Oh, please, Ms Porter, I...<eos> I know this sounds completely crazy, but... but I've been seeing things and hearing things, and... and, well, nobody believes me because I'm pregnant.<eos> - And then Helena Knoll mentioned you...
But for two errors.<eos> We must place blame on your husband for the first.<eos> If Mr Kelmot had not blundered into Madame Schirmer's atelier... And so taken me from my course, you wouldn't have had to loiter for such a suspiciously long period of time.<eos> But you had no choice, so loiter you did.<eos> I would also make the observation that there is nothing about you that signifies the type of woman who enjoys window shopping, especially the window of a taxidermist.
- Surprised?<eos> - A little.<eos> I'm just on my way to pick up some papers from the court.<eos> Walk with me.<eos> So, Carter kept quiet about you, what are you, Foreign Office, MI5?
- Mr Lombard... ..you seem to be under the impression that I am a particular kind of woman.<eos> And I assure you that I am not.<eos> I do not like to be looked at.<eos> I get instincts about people.<eos> I've an instinct about you.
This has been happening every week.<eos> My private life should be off-limits.<eos> I see that you are still seeing Jason.<eos> He photographs well for his age.<eos> Ma'am, the Apple Growers Association would like to name a new brand of apple after you.
Oh, I'd love one, Gary. Thank you.<eos> Okay, I'll get... I'll get you one.<eos> Well, I've asked America if she wants me to be her president.<eos> Now she's gonna give us her answer.<eos> - ( clears throat ) - America doesn't just love you, ma'am, - she is in love with you.
But we must persevere with spirit for as long as we possibly can.<eos> That's the trick to staying young, don't you think?<eos> That's not a trick I seek.<eos> He speaks very highly of you, Mrs. Poole.<eos> While he speaks of you so rarely.
What about that scamp who gave us so much trouble at Saratoga?<eos> Benedict Arnold.<eos> I hear he once stayed at your house.<eos> When I was 14.<eos> If my eyes are any judge, I imagine he must still think of you.
I'm sorry, I can't say it.<eos> I know it's far from ideal, Michael.<eos> There is no ideal. Other than repealing the law.<eos> May we have a moment?<eos> President Petrov asked me to remain with you.
~ When do they actually start digging?<eos> ~ In two days' time.<eos> I want you down at the site, Harry, spade in hand.<eos> The first piece of earth to be turned for the Selfridge Estate.<eos> Miss Webb, I need details about you for the press release.
You should see it in the spring.<eos> The riot of lilacs in the wind smells nothing at all like the stockyards and slaughterhouses one usually associates with the Verger name.<eos> Can you please let your brother know I'm here?<eos> He knows.<eos> Some people have trouble talking with Mason, so if it bothers you or you can't take it,
I can't tell him.<eos> ~ Why?<eos> ~ Because I just...<eos> I can't.<eos> Is it because you don't want him thinking badly of you?
Sean Bennigan was there on someone's direct orders.<eos> Question him, break him, and we'll get our answers.<eos> Where's my son?<eos> They should be bringing him in now.<eos> Mrs. Bennigan, we ran a thorough series of tests on you and your son.
That I hope great-grandpa Larry feels all my love because it's as big as a million kisses from a million angels in heaven. Hmm.<eos> Well, I guess that's better than nothing.<eos> Is that her?<eos> How could you be married to someone for that long and not...?<eos> - Are they talking about you?
What are you trying to tell me, old man?<eos> Yeah, good luck with that.<eos> All right.<eos> You know what, he knows something.<eos> (phone rings) I was just thinking about you, Deputy Mayor.
Well, I'm checking out of the hotel tomorrow.<eos> I just needed to pick up a few things.<eos> Oh, uh, Rosie, this is Olivia Rice.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> I have... heard about you.
He's told me a lot.<eos> He was very specific.<eos> You should know that I love my son, but he's distressed.<eos> We're going through a difficult time right now.<eos> The things he... said about you, he was saying them way before Matt was killed.
You made me look like an idiot in front of my boss.<eos> You did that to yourself.<eos> You saw an old lady and never thought of the possibility, though I was exhibiting all of the behavior.<eos> Look, I-I-I need to tell your son.<eos> He's been all over me about what's wrong with you.
Hello.<eos> I'm Bruce Wayne.<eos> Barbara Kean. Oh.<eos> Selina never said you're who she's staying with.<eos> Detective Gordon spoke of you.
So your solution is to remove yourself from the world you wish to protect?<eos> Where's the sense in that?<eos> There is not a man or woman, no matter how fit he or she may be, who is capable of carrying the entire world on their shoulders.<eos> Steve was.<eos> From what Mr. Stark has told me, Captain Rogers relied heavily on you...
It was difficult, I'll not deny it.<eos> You think I should accept his terms and set the date?<eos> Oh, no, no.<eos> That's your decision.<eos> I can only say he was very moving when he spoke of you.
Sheriff Leena Reyes.<eos> And you are?<eos> Katrina Crane.<eos> Ichabod has a wife?<eos> He never mentioned you.
You're afraid it's gonna make him push you away.<eos> Yes.<eos> I haven't been with the major that long, but one thing I know is that he values honesty very highly.<eos> More so than most gentlemen.<eos> Whatever that letter says, he won't think less of you for sharing it.
Like a gorgeous, imposing woman I don't know standing right in front of me.<eos> I'm gonna stop talking.<eos> CGIS Special Agent Abigail Borin.<eos> Agent Borin, yes, of course.<eos> Miss Sciuto in D.C. has told me all about you.
Uh... though, that being said, you know, if you'd like to give it a... a try, I'm sure it couldn't hurt, right?<eos> So you're the Charles I've heard so much about?<eos> I hope some of it's been good.<eos> Well, I've only heard wonderful things.<eos> And I've heard wonderful things about you as well.
If I could, I would take forever.<eos> The second I leave here, everything will change.<eos> He will take another wife.<eos> And he will say, as you heard him, that it is merely a transaction, that it is a necessity.<eos> You don't believe that?
Look, Ms. Parsons... I'm sorry about all this.<eos> I have a lawyer who can help you.<eos> Assistant District Attorney Erin Reagan.<eos> Here's her card. All right?<eos> She's expecting a call from you, okay?
Thank you.<eos> How was your trip?<eos> Well, it was a lot of flying.<eos> But I'm glad I went.<eos> Uh, Admiral Hill asked to see you as soon as you got back.
Do your thing.<eos> It's more important.<eos> This is for the people of cinema.<eos> Because the people of cinema can be relied on.<eos> Just like you.
She knows we all do.<eos> Excuse me, Secretary McCord.<eos> President Shiraz.<eos> I'm glad you're okay.<eos> I can say the same of you.
The rest is detail.<eos> This is what was missing, right?<eos> Thanks.<eos> "The patient's medical situation "is incurable, with a low life expectancy."<eos> I know nothing about you.
That Mrs Hughes is going to borrow one of your coats to be married in.<eos> Was I to have any say in this as you rifle through my cupboards?<eos> Your Ladyship, there's obviously been a misunderstanding.<eos> I'm surprised at you, Mrs Hughes.<eos> This is not the kind of behaviour I would look for from you.
Getting the care he needs.<eos> Who are you?<eos> I'm Dr. Exner.<eos> She's from the government.<eos> Cynthia's told me all about you.
She looked out for the jobs, lent me clothes, drove me to the interviews.<eos> One time I remember the horse went lame and we both got stuck in the mud.<eos> Oh, the talking we had to do when we got back!<eos> I remember we were so worried.<eos> But she never said a thing about you.
A table of singletons at our age, well done.<eos> Single now, we're all war widows.<eos> I am not a war widow.<eos> Good to see you again, Mr Rogers.<eos> You, too. Although I haven't been allowed to forget you.
Well, that man shot your husband.<eos> As soon as we figure out why, we'll get back to you.<eos> But who is he?<eos> As you anticipated, captain, Dr. Henson's wife didn't report him missing last night.<eos> But after you called me this morning, I checked missing-persons reports for the past 24 hours, and there are two black males who match the age and physical description of your killer...
Clifton claims you're one to watch, Billy.<eos> A tenacious young wildcatter.<eos> And you must be...<eos> Emma Lundegren.<eos> My grandfather's told us so much about you.
The noise just never stops.<eos> And yet...<eos> I feel...<eos> I just feel so alone.<eos> I'm not sure how I feel about doctors in general, but maybe I can start by thinking of you as a friend.
Take him down.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Did you just actually back my play?<eos> Hell, yeah.<eos> I didn't expect that coming from you.
Who is he?<eos> His father.<eos> Beaumont Rosewood, Sr.<eos> I presume you're Detective Villa.<eos> I've heard a lot about you.
Actually, I don't have a day.<eos> Mr. Canning told me you'd be able to move faster than he could.<eos> - Louis Canning?<eos> - Yes.<eos> He already filed the suit, but he got busy with another case, and he thought you'd be good to take it over.
Good help these days.<eos> So, yes, I actually do think<eos> - we can squeeze in a meeting tomorrow.<eos> - Ms. Groom, did the 8th Street Clinic<eos> - perform an abortion on you?
I was told I could stay here with my husband.<eos> Of course.<eos> You used the lavatory about an hour ago. Do you remember that?<eos> I don't have Alzheimer's.<eos> Do you know if someone else went in there after you?
Mom...<eos> Ananya.<eos> Hello, Aunty!<eos> Hello...<eos> Krish is always talking about you!
- I am.<eos> - Hello, ma'am.<eos> Your daughter, she's done a great injustice.<eos> So we've come here seeking revenge.<eos> You see, we may not look like much... but between the three of us, we have five legs, four eyes... and two-and-a-half working pairs of lungs. But we also have two dozen eggs... so if I were you, I would go back inside.
Who knows, could be the making of you.<eos> Hello.<eos> - This is, um...<eos> Friends call me Mu.<eos> I've heard so much about you, Mrs Fleming.
Why ever not?<eos> How lovely to see you.<eos> This is Ann, Lady O'Neil.<eos> This is Mrs Evelyn Fleming.<eos> I've heard so much about you.
- We were just talking about Ian. - Really?<eos> - Do you know Ian well?<eos> - Lil introduced me.<eos> Now we are firm friends.<eos> He never mentioned you. How is he?
My dear friend Delphine Day.<eos> We met on the boat coming over.<eos> Now we're inseparable!<eos> I've heard so much about you, I feel as if I already know you!<eos> And I've heard of you.
That seems to be her specialty.<eos> So, tell me. Who's the guy in the restaurant?<eos> The guy in the restaurant. He looked familiar.<eos> I think I saw him duck into a hotel with you the other day.<eos> But today he didn't seem quite so happy to see you, what with the wife and all, the kids. You know?
- Why?<eos> It's only an escape.<eos> Bingo.<eos> Mrs. G, I... I'm sorry.<eos> I fail to see the wonder of you.
And tell me, how would we handle the repercussions of firing our comm director<eos> - three months after we hire him?<eos> - You don't fire him.<eos> You tell him that you're bringing me on board to help with the workload.<eos> He stays on with you, I cover your husband.
Mrs Turner and Timothy?<eos> Mr Delaney?<eos> Welcome, welcome. Both of you.<eos> This all looks very...cosy.<eos> Since you telephoned, we've lost three more members and our pianist.
The man you're talking about, he doesn't...<eos> He doesn't know that Ellie's his daughter, and he wouldn't do anything to my kids.<eos> - He wouldn't.<eos> I... - who wouldn't?<eos> ! Mrs. Logan, I have tried to give you the benefit of the doubt, but your family has been missing for too long while you sit here and you continue to withhold critical facts from the police!
- I'm sure you are.<eos> - Right, so... so that... that... that...<eos> That's why none of this makes sense.<eos> Pounding headaches, I can't sleep, I throw up every day, I'm exhausted.<eos> I read about you in a magazine.
What's happening?<eos> Are you married, Mrs. Redmond?<eos> Divorced.<eos> His father's no longer in the picture.<eos> I was hoping that there would be someone who could be with you right now.
He's named after his father.<eos> I know things didn't end well here with Jacky's dad.<eos> It was a long time ago.<eos> It was.<eos> I've gotta tell you, though, he often spoke of you, and well.
Well, some of us have to put certain things to rest before we can build high chairs.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> I'm-I'm looking for Catherine Jensen.<eos> Oh, I'm her mother Marie Burgess.<eos> Oh, I've-I've heard a lot much about you.
Are you sure you're willing to risk it?<eos> You're right, Miss Robertson.<eos> I really did forget myself that time.<eos> Back to the issue.<eos> So, Mrs. Hemming, I'll need to ask you about your toilet rituals.
Wait, this is an actual movie?<eos> This fall, sparks will fly.<eos> Mrs Sullivan!<eos> Between one guy who can't get a break...<eos> There's something about you, Mrs Sullivan... and 9 cats who break all the rules.
I'm just curious, how did you get my number?<eos> Well, Miss Dimello said you came highly recommended by, uh... by...<eos> Judge Tillinghast.<eos> We go way back. Way.<eos> Apparently, he had some very nice things to say about you. Said you took initiative. Always found creative solutions.
Hey, baby.<eos> Happy you made it.<eos> Captain, I'd like you to meet my wife, sharon.<eos> I've heard such great things about you.<eos> And you.
Samba, let's clear up any misunderstandings.<eos> I like you very much too but I don't think I'm ready.<eos> So I'd like to preserve a little distance between us for now.<eos> Sure... But, actually...<eos> I don't mean you.
- _ - (Chuckles)<eos> - _ - Mm-hmm.<eos> _<eos> Uh, oh, my God.<eos> Travis has told me so much about you.
This is for Meera.<eos> And for me? Come on...<eos> Fast, fast, fast.<eos> And this is for you.<eos> Wow! It looks great on you, Ma'am.
Halfway to the city is gonna be like another hour or two.<eos> I know you went to see Zachary Orcutt.<eos> You know I evaluated him for the court five years ago after he murdered his family.<eos> Okay. Why are you telling me this?<eos> Shortly after you spoke with him, Zachary Orcutt disappeared from his ward and hasn't been seen since.
You may dismiss me, gentlemen, as a one-time runner of saloon whores, but I remember many a face in this room.<eos> Be advised that the secrets you spilled in my stews to the faceless girls from whom you took your pleasure... the boastings and vauntings you made in your cups... now belong to me, to dispense as I see fit.<eos> You have been too much at the oysters, Miss Hart. or is it the port wine has turned your stomach?<eos> Oh, I do not blame you.<eos> I should seek oblivion myself, if I were you.
Madeline.<eos> Four months ago.<eos> Then she was frozen.<eos> And then discarded four days ago, when you were finally supposed to have your equipment repossessed.<eos> Arastoo has told Armin and myself a great deal about you.
That's nice to hear.<eos> Yeah. They're great.<eos> And you also know Nick Ford.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> He also has really great things to say about you, and he really wants you to have this seat.
All right, go ahead.<eos> Thanks for stopping by, Ms. Wright.<eos> We did a little digging on you.<eos> So what?<eos> About your husband and your children and what everyone said about you but could never prove.
Please help us catch the man who did this.<eos> I'm afraid.<eos> He won't hurt you.<eos> I won't let him.<eos> It looks beautiful on you.
I'm May Carleton .<eos> I train Tommy Shelby's horse.<eos> And you're the woman who he said was going to sail away.<eos> I see he didn't tell you about me.<eos> He did tell me about you, I wonder if that's significant.
I don't mean to be rude, but if you asked God, I think He'd tell you that was a load of crap.<eos> You don't mean to be rude and you talk like that in my house?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I just don't understand.<eos> Hey, I don't want to say anything bad against you...
She'd been wooing Dr. Keating for a position here, but after getting blown off like that...<eos> Professor Keating. Hi.<eos> This is my fiancé, Aiden Walker.<eos> He works for the mayor of New York.<eos> Michaela speaks very highly of you.
Sure. Call you later.<eos> - Got an update for Calder. - I'm sorry.<eos> He's out of the office.<eos> Do you know when he'll be back? I don't.<eos> But as soon as he checks back in, I'll let him know you stopped by.
Who's that?<eos> Erm, Mum, this is my boss, Governor Ferguson.<eos> Hello.<eos> I'm very pleased to meet you, Mrs Bennett.<eos> Vera has told me so much about you.
I've done something that I shouldn't have.<eos> And if you knew what it was, you wouldn't want to be part of this.<eos> I know what it was.<eos> Now, come down in five minutes. Ahh.<eos> It is wonderful on you, My Lady.
Mum, you're... you're fine.<eos> Who's that?<eos> Mum, this is my boss, Governor Ferguson. Hello.<eos> I'm very pleased to meet you, Mrs Bennett.<eos> Vera has told me so much about you.
She is not Carter's other mom.<eos> She is Carter's kidnapper.<eos> Yes, I just... I thought you should know,<eos> I have that thing where I'm not objective.<eos> I see what Carter means about you.
Respectfully, but I pass.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Managers.<eos> You must be Captain Raydor.<eos> I've heard a lot about you.
I beg your pardon?<eos> Get out. This is private.<eos> Believe me, Governor, you don't want anyone to hear this.<eos> I'll handle this.<eos> This is fucked up, even for you.
You made it.<eos> You're Viper?<eos> What I got is going to bring the United States to its knees.<eos> They say Thomas Jefferson, your first Secretary of State, _ shared a bottle of this 1788 Clos DE Griffier cognac with my predecessor Jean Baptiste Ternant who, um, didn't realize that Jefferson was, uh, really a wine aficionado.<eos> However, our research of you, Madam Secretary, uh, suggests that you will find this cognac more pleasing. Merci, Minister Dubois.
Time to test your theory.<eos> So, is that vodka or water?<eos> Gin.<eos> And I'm waiting for someone.<eos> I'm only asking 'cause it would say a lot about you, your plans for the evening.
RYAN: Yeah.<eos> I thought we agreed that you were leaving.<eos> Well, I had a thought about the case.<eos> You're not on the case.<eos> Actually, I was thinking about you.
Deputy district attorney. That's right.<eos> The Reagans prefer the home team when it comes to justice in our society.<eos> Both sides need a voice.<eos> Oh, I'm only saying that it's puzzling that for a family so committed to respecting authority, we've had this problem with Nicky.<eos> Mrs. Wilson, I'm sorry for what I said about you.
Why would you...?<eos> At first, I thought they were from a particularly rancid brand of cheese, but, no... they're from one of Pepe's treats.<eos> Homemade?<eos> Harlan was able to give us the names of nine other people he believed to be other competitors.<eos> Our colleagues are investigating them as we speak, but I'll quite happily recommend that the NYPD focus its attention entirely on you.
It's pretty clear you don't want any visitors.<eos> So why don't you just let us back up from your fence and we'll be on our way?<eos> - It's not that simple.<eos> - Well, sure, it is.<eos> I don't know anything about you.
Linda, do you think this book will help bring about, you know, any change for other girls that are in this predicament?<eos> I do have that hope. I... God forbid there's somebody out there that's going through what I went through.<eos> And maybe they can get the courage to get out of it.<eos> I hope this book helps her to realize that that you can come out of this a complete person again.<eos> Linda, you really were, and are, but especially in the early seventies, you were quite a celebrity.
I do have that hope. I...

Go ahead.<eos> Ah.<eos> Agent Nelson.<eos> And you must be Rebecca Scott.<eos> Your husband spoke of you often.
He had my shoulder to lean on.<eos> He still does.<eos> He needs his father's too.<eos> He has that now.<eos> I don't know if it's to do with your faith... but there's something very lost about you.
This is my mother, this is Lady Cremone.<eos> Oh, Your Ladyship, how lovely to meet you.<eos> I was hoping we would be introduced.<eos> So happy to meet you.<eos> My son never stops talking about you.
I was hoping we would be introduced.<eos> So happy to meet you.<eos> My son never stops talking about you.<eos> No, no, he does.<eos> Every time I see him he mentions you, you're quite his favourite person.
It's a pleasure meeting you, I'm the grandmother.<eos> Of course, you are Keita's grandmother, I'm pleased meeting you.<eos> But you are so young...<eos> Flattery won't take you anywhere.<eos> I don't think I'll ever see you again, so there's no need for it.
They'll all give preference to their candidates. There will be a tender. You can fill that too.<eos> Madam, sugar?<eos> As much as you like. What?<eos> When things aren't our way... Then, why don't you add sugar as much as you want. Whether you get the tender or not but you will surely get a good cup of tea.<eos> I've heard a lot about you. Mr. Jaiswal.
It's not that I think Dr. Lecter's dangerous. I don't.<eos> I am concerned about a relationship he has with one of his patients, a man named Will Graham.<eos> Without consent or a court order, I'd be in breach of confidentiality.<eos> That's correct.<eos> So, if we can't discuss Dr. Lecter, perhaps we can discuss you.
- If there isn't anything you like,<eos> I've got a stack of itunes gift cards. I...<eos> I've got a stack of gift cards.<eos> I don't... Do well redeeming gift cards.<eos> - Probably says something about you. - Probably does.
Well, she missed a treat there, pet.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Chatting.<eos> Is that what you call it?<eos> Not to you, to my mates.
What a lovely sound.<eos> You are unrelentingly cultured.<eos> Come, let's find it.<eos> I do hope you know how well I think of you.<eos> As I do you.
We have a store to open.<eos> All well in accessories, Miss Mardle?<eos> We are missing half the ribbon consignment.<eos> Improvise.<eos> I know I can rely on you and your excellent assistants.
I decide what's relevant, Mr. Karp.<eos> Were you thinking of...me?<eos> It was a sleep study. I just...<eos> I... You got me.<eos> Yes, I was totally thinking of you.
But you were Charlie's drug counselor, yes?<eos> Yes. Poor girl.<eos> Have a seat. Thank you.<eos> Yes, it seems that she, uh... she broke out to buy some coke.<eos> Is that a... is that a black mark against you?
I'll let Sister Julienne know all's well, and register you for home delivery.<eos> Nobody told me we'd be having company.<eos> Molly's baby's almost due, Mr Brignall.<eos> She'll have regular visits from midwives from now on.<eos> I didn't mean you.
I'm sure.<eos> Erm... Liam does English at Kings, too.<eos> Well, it's nice to put a face to a name, Liam.<eos> Likewise.<eos> Charlotte talks about you a lot.
Hello, Connor.<eos> That's far enough, son.<eos> Ambassador Tennety.<eos> Connor Lang.<eos> I've heard a lot about you.
Oh. Off to celebrate, are we?<eos> Ah. I get it.<eos> Well, change can be rough.<eos> But once you get used to it, you'll never believe you did a hernia repair any other way.<eos> And if I may say, that sweatshirt is quite becoming on you.
Mrs. Stafford... I think Michael is still in love with you.<eos> He has a funny way of showing it.<eos> Leaving me for Hooker Barbie?<eos> But I watch him.<eos> He's always talking about you.
From me.<eos> Nice going.<eos> Oh... sorry, I had no idea.<eos> For the best. Uh, you run the EKG, and I'll order the X ray.<eos> Okay, I'm just gonna put these leads on you, all right?
We can treat this.<eos> You're going to need therapy, and it's going to be hard work, but you'll get back to the person that you were.<eos> So it wasn't my fault.<eos> No. (Sigh of relief)<eos> Well, I'm feeling kind of bad about you right now.
No, of course not.<eos> I told you, he's up all night.<eos> And it's just you, no husband, no boyfriend, or partner?<eos> It's just me.<eos> Well, that's a lot of pressure on you.
Colin fires lawyers once a week.<eos> But he's kept you on.<eos> You're probably the most successful relationship in his life.<eos> - I wouldn't call it a relationship.<eos> - He talks about you.
What will you do with that?<eos> Cover it and dry it on the stove, then put it into muslin bags.<eos> Lady Gillingham's maid buys it in packets.<eos> Perhaps she's not a country girl.<eos> Judging by you, she's the poorer for that.
You'd be wise to turn over your book, Ms. Bash.<eos> You're not my lawyer.<eos> Yeah, but Peter and Jared are mine.<eos> I like people fine.<eos> I'm just not sure how I feel about you.
- Mrs. Roebuck?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Elise Wassermann, Brigade Criminelle. Ah.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> Karl's told me a lot about you.
What changed your mind?<eos> I suppose it came to me that these balls and presentations and comings out are not just aristocratic folderol but traditions by which members of this family measure their progress through life.<eos> And you wanted to be part of that?<eos> Well, I felt by dismissing it as trivia, I was being smug and intolerant.<eos> Do they know what they have in you?
Well, you're not presented for conversation.<eos> This is Mrs Dudley Ward.<eos> Of course you are!<eos> Have we met? No.<eos> I read about you in the American newspapers.
And you want to sing at the Savoy?<eos> Just one song, whenever you can fit me in.<eos> I just always wanted to sing on a stage.<eos> There's a real sweetness to your voice; a warmth.<eos> It tells me who you are.
Mrs Roebuck?<eos> Yes.<eos> Elise Wassermann, Brigade Criminelle. Ah.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> Karl's told me a lot about you.
Tell me about it.<eos> Um... it was nice to meet you.<eos> You, too.<eos> By the way...<eos> You should know that your dad talked about you all the time.
But first, you're gonna tell me who else in the house.<eos> How come you don't know?<eos> I haven't talked to your daddy in a long time.<eos> And he want to surprise me, too.<eos> I've never heard of you.
Did your husband think you were having an affair?<eos> I didn't care what he thought.<eos> You don't seem to care that your husband's dead.<eos> You have no idea what I care about.<eos> And you have no idea what it's like to be trapped with someone who doesn't care about you at all for more than 30 years.
Well, that's what they're doing to you.<eos> They're turning you into the story.<eos> They started by leaking your relationship with Congressman Brody.<eos> Next it was Saul Berenson's testimony in front of the Senate Select Committee, then they had you committed.<eos> Pretty soon, it's not a story about a terrorist attack anymore or how the people meant to protect us screwed up. It's about you.
You'd better sit down.<eos> Now, if I interpreted your answer to my letter correctly, you're not exactly leaping at this very attractive offer I've made you.<eos> Well, I...<eos> You'd be guaranteed a very healthy advance.<eos> But I can see from what you're wearing, you're not particularly interested in money.
Nothing.<eos> But I know how she thinks and...<eos> She wants results and she will charge right into a situation without thinking and...<eos> She gets that from me.<eos> I think she gets a lot of things from you.
Uh, he's retired.<eos> I was just wondering...<eos> I was wondering if he was yours.<eos> Why would you wonder that, dear?<eos> Because he mentioned you.
Don't just close the book on your murder.<eos> Stop hundreds more from happening, and I can help you do that.<eos> This is my cell.<eos> I'm staying at the Pirsig Motel on Alpine.<eos> I look forward to hearing from you.
But until we can sort this out you should find a different place to stay other than your house.<eos> I can stay at a friend's place.<eos> She's away for the week.<eos> I know where the keys are.<eos> I'll follow you.
But only if she undergoes medical treatment.<eos> And by that we mean she must be given proper medication.<eos> Yes.<eos> I just want what's best for the children, that's all that guides me.<eos> We have run a number of psychiatric tests and evaluations on you.
Mr Weston, the display has proven how good her product is.<eos> What benefit is there in delay?<eos> If she feels we're too keen, then the deal will be made on her terms.<eos> Let her woo us.<eos> They're talking about you.
June, this is my mother, Su-Min Lee.<eos> Please, call me Su-Min Lee.<eos> Which means, "so mean" to me.<eos> It's a pleasure to meet you.<eos> I've heard such a great deal about you.
You whore!<eos> Big Wang, have you met my grandmotherMah Mah?<eos> No, I haven't. Hello.<eos> I'm Big Wang Bai.<eos> My mother's told me all about you.
Imagine that was your father.<eos> You would want me to do my best to find out who did this horrible thing. Right?<eos> So I'm going to ask one more time.<eos> Are you telling me the truth?<eos> My husband told me all about you.
Mr. Ashbaugh thought that he should be allowed to testify to some of the concerns he had over the board members.<eos> We argued that was not essential to the facts.<eos> And did you change his mind?<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> And did you claim that Mr. Ashbaugh was in love with you?
As you wish, sir.<eos> I don't know what you were expecting, but..<eos> I gave up another job to come and work here.<eos> You should've thought it over before if you'll need a second nurse or not.<eos> I didn't know then how incompetent you are.
There you go. - Hey!<eos> Mom, I would like you to meet Candace.<eos> Hi!<eos> For Michael, the bomb dropped on Wednesday.<eos> I've heard so much about you.
At first, when I found out I was pregnant,<eos> I wasn't going to tell Tobey, but I couldn't work, so I needed money for medical bills and... rent.<eos> Then when he saw the ultrasound, it's like he became an entirely different person.<eos> He said he finally had something to live for.<eos> Why didn't Tobey tell his family about you and the baby?
Seems to me you've lost quite enough already.<eos> Pip?<eos> - Pip.<eos> - Oh, enough!<eos> What I have to say to Estella I will say before you.
Victim's name was Justine Winfield.<eos> She's married, lives here in town.<eos> Checked in alone last night for a one-night stay. This is Wes's therapist.<eos> This is Dr. Ryan.<eos> Oh, yeah, I heard about you.
Well, I don't curse, so I'm gonna have to call you Potsie.<eos> Very good, ma'am.<eos> These gentlemen are Secret Service agents.<eos> They will take you into the arena.<eos> And if everything goes according to plan, they will be with you the rest of your life.
News is no longer meant to be remembered.<eos> It's just entertainment.<eos> So if you hit your convention speech out of the park, the next news cycle will be the comeback of Sarah Palin.<eos> Yeah. I can do that.<eos> Now, everyone's heard a lot of crazy stories about you.
-Who's next?<eos> Wanda Williams.<eos> -Who is it?<eos> -This is Nona Alberts from Adams.<eos> I heard about you.
We are not cowboys.<eos> Why not? - You must be lieutenant Diakhaté.<eos> Diakhite.<eos> Greetings, Captain Morland.<eos> Strange to see you.
Dr. Wilson?<eos> - Hi. So you're Maxine Sutherland's daughter.<eos> Yes.<eos> My daughter Claire and I are just visiting from DC.<eos> You know, I have to say, I've known Maxine for a long time, and... she hasn't told me much about you.
Iris, good to see you.<eos> Hi.<eos> Iris, Shepard Lambrick.<eos> Iris.<eos> Dr. Barden's told me much about you.
It doesn't matter.<eos> It really doesn't matter.<eos> You'll live it down.<eos> The only thing that matters is to do good work.<eos> I oughtn't to care what those swines say about me, but I do, and I care about what they say about you.
I'm a writer.<eos> That's why you're here?<eos> I find this place provides...<eos> Inspiration.<eos> Don't you?
No, you should, but alas, we are where we are.<eos> Can you help us?<eos> Of course.<eos> True love, Ms. Swan... the only magic powerful enough to transcend realms and break any curse.<eos> Luckily for you, I happen to have bottled some.
Hey, man, uh, can you take this guy to the box for us, please?<eos> Yeah, you got it. You're not gonna say anything, right?<eos> Travis?<eos> Dr. Ryan.<eos> Hey, Wes was just talking about you.
I won't blame you for anything.<eos> I'm going to kill you tonight, dear Tom.<eos> I have to.<eos> It's what I am.<eos> That's what I love about you.
But no using phones.<eos> Is that clear?<eos> Got it. So sorry.<eos> Ooh, is that an egg white omelet?<eos> You are just amazing, Mrs. M. You make Martha Stewart look like a slacker.
I've seen the videotape.<eos> It's no wonder her life turned out as rough as it did.<eos> But you could've prevented that, and you did nothing.<eos> Nothing.<eos> If you don't stop telling lies about Amanda Clarke, I'm gonna start telling the truth about you.
Well, I'm not gonna raise my white flag in surrender just yet.<eos> But I will tell you this...<eos> The Warden's got himself a new toy. Mr. Porter is not a toy.<eos> No argument here.<eos> I was talking about you.
So, Brianna, I saw the robot arm in the user profile, so I know you made that video.<eos> So I thought we could sit and talk for a minute.<eos> Look, Brianna, I know you're better than this.<eos> Can we talk about you for a few minutes?<eos> Can we talk about you instead?
We connect people.<eos> Let's hope we connected with the judge.<eos> When this case started, I thought you people were all being petty.<eos> I don't think that anymore.<eos> Miss soto, I do believe You had a genuine relationship with Henry Strauss.
I can't even drink with someone without them dying.<eos> Sorry, I wish I could tell you what happened.<eos> I know what happened.<eos> Hannah McKay.<eos> Sal Price was writing a book on you.
- Oh, my God. She is that good.<eos> What happened?<eos> - I was hoping you could tell me that.<eos> - How can I do that? Ms. McKay, I was hoping that we could cut through the crap.<eos> Sal Price was writing a book on you.
I mean, he could be such a nice man... When he was himself.<eos> And when he wasn't himself?<eos> Well, it was the drugs.<eos> They made him angry.<eos> Did he ever take that out on you?
In that case, he won't object if I ask you for a dance.<eos> You know what?<eos> I wouldn't care even if he did.<eos> Shall we?<eos> So... tell me, Ms. Harrington, what should I know about you?
Yeah, thought you'd appreciate the irony.<eos> That may be the meanest thing you've said about me.<eos> Oh, you haven't read my columns; they were pretty mean.<eos> I may have read a few of your columns.<eos> For years, I wrote about you being an affront to women because you stayed with your husband.
I'm meeting him in an hour, and I'm giving him a choice...<eos> Either he sends my ex-husband or he accepts my resignation.<eos> Now, you've just heard that from a very high-level source at State.<eos> I want to be on that plane. Oh, Ms. Berg.<eos> If it goes awry, it'll be background for my piece on you, but if the current Secretary of State sends her ex-husband to rescue a bunch of hostages in Iran and it works, I want that story.
They were trying to cover their tracks.<eos> What the hell is she doing with this guy?<eos> Hello, you two.<eos> You must be Cindi.<eos> Dominic has told me so much about you.
So, if anyone made a mistake taking money from Torben, it's Mr. Simon.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Channing isn't responsible for any of it.<eos> What a nice surprise.<eos> After you called, I thought, it's been too long.
We have a chance to talk to her.<eos> But Mr. Deeks believes your emotions are clouding your judgment.<eos> Well, that's a little harsh, but... yeah.<eos> Call the girl, Mr. Beale.<eos> Maybe she'll see in you what you see in her, Miss Blye.
Oh, where you got shot.<eos> I just expected something bigger.<eos> I mean not, like, a huge, gaping hole, but I don't know.<eos> A dent, a spider crack.<eos> Oh, uh, my secretary found that article about you in the Old Sandwich Press.
Well, if her Ladyship is prepared to visit Crawley House, I dare say you won't object when I do.<eos> I won't forbid it because I have no right to do so.<eos> But I do object, with every fibre of my being.<eos> You disappoint me.<eos> I never thought of you as a woman with no standards.
You have no proof of that.<eos> All you have is conjecture... imagination... theories. Theories that are disrupting proper police work.<eos> Now, we're grateful to you for your help but... ..this case is solved. It's over.<eos> I have a responsibility here, Mrs. Gray, not only to bringing the right man to justice but also to you and to Timothy as well.<eos> I'm quite certain he has no idea what you've been doing, any more than he knows what you did in the war.
You have, Ma'am.<eos> It says so above the door.<eos> Moray!<eos> Let me introduce you to my dearest friend, Jocelin.<eos> I've heard a great deal about you, Mrs Brookmire.
It is not too late.<eos> I fear it was always too late with Moray.<eos> He loves his wife still.<eos> He would be a lesser man if he did not.<eos> If you were the one who had married him and - forgive the macabre turn, Miss Glendenning - if you had died, what kind of man would that make him if he all-too-easily forsook you?
Not that I saw.<eos> Ernie and I had lunch plans.<eos> We were just about to leave when I went into the back to use the restroom.<eos> Yes, we saw as much on the security footage.<eos> We also saw your manager, Armin Gagnon, heading into the men's room just behind you.
It's cheap, the guy who owned it went bust.<eos> But they want to rent to someone who can see the possibilities.<eos> It's nice to meet you.<eos> Mark hasn't said a lot.<eos> You almost got a mystical aura, not that he has said anything bad about you.
Sometimes it's hard to think as fast as I speak.<eos> You'll make a very good Mrs Moray.<eos> An even better Mrs Moray, no doubt.<eos> If only I had a ounce of your charm and elegance.<eos> No wonder he fell for you.
Uh, am I in the right place?<eos> I'm looking for a Dr. Zoe Hart, beloved small town G.P.<eos> Do I know you?<eos> I'm Martin Hines. I'm from the Johns Hopkins Alumni Magazine.<eos> I'm here to do a profile on you.
We need help.<eos> Mr. Gold.<eos> Actually, he goes by "Rumplestiltskin."<eos> True love, Ms. Swan... the only magic powerful enough to transcend realms and break any curse.<eos> Luckily for you, I happen to have bottled some.
He didn't go to bed.<eos> I found him in the living room.<eos> At first I thought it was the case that he was working on, but that's not the case, is it?<eos> He says that... that he loves somebody else.<eos> It's you I presume?
And though you're not pretty any more than I am handsome, I must say it becomes you.<eos> And now I see you're fascinated by the flowers on the rug.<eos> Come, speak to me.<eos> Fact is, Miss Eyre, I'd like to draw you out.<eos> You have rather the look of another world about you.
And he was no different.<eos> You were close?<eos> Yes.<eos> Well, we're related.<eos> But, Mrs. Van Gundy, I want to talk about you and your life beyond all of this.
She's in the bushes.<eos> Don't be taking those women any more pies, you understand?<eos> They made me stand there like I was the vacuum salesman.<eos> Why, Minny?<eos> Because they know about you getting knocked up by Mr. Johnny.
That was some night, huh?<eos> I'm sure you and Larry Crowne have your pillow talk.<eos> Pillow talk?<eos> Lance is a sweetie, but I think he was born in the 1950s.<eos> Lance is forever mute on the subject of you. Can't get a peep out of him.
Mr. Hoover.<eos> I'm not sure where you think this is headed.<eos> Right, of course.<eos> Miss Gandy.<eos> I know we've only known each other a brief time... but you would make the finest of companions.
I'm in the Olive Garden.<eos> I order crab tortellini.<eos> Catastrophically allergic to crab.<eos> Why do I order it?<eos> Because I'm thinking of you.
Ugh. Winston.<eos> It's been too long.<eos> I was just saying that to Chance.<eos> And you must be Ilsa Pucci.<eos> I've heard so much about you.
You all right, Ms. Fortenberry?<eos> That no-good brother of yours, he packed up and left me.<eos> I cared for him like he was my own kin.<eos> And he left me, just like they all leave me.<eos> Well, I'm sure Tommy cared about you.
I'm facing prison.<eos> I got arrested on a drug charge... third offense... and, uh... I got a cocaine problem.<eos> I'm working on it, but...<eos> Anyway, I was thinking, everything happens for a reason.<eos> And I figured, I landed splat on you 'cause I wasn't meant to die.
it was to bring the four of us together.<eos> Help you, gentlemen?<eos> Yeah...<eos> We're looking for a lawyer.<eos> Damien Winslow told us about you.
This has nothing to do with what actually happened.<eos> - You're twisting things.<eos> - I don't do that.<eos> I'm not like that, Annie.<eos> This is not about you, Miss Costello.
Ma'am, how about some sausages?<eos> - I'll have one.<eos> - Please do.<eos> Very nice.<eos> I'm talking about you!
You're biting off even more than you can chew.<eos> This will be a war.<eos> I will wage it.<eos> Between now and trial, you need to become sympathetic.<eos> Bottom line: If the jury doesn't love you, you're done.
Bathroom?<eos> Don't get a lot of field work?<eos> Not really known for my marksmanship.<eos> Well, you're not really known for much at all.<eos> In fact, no one that works here has ever heard of you.
Vivian's getting pretty good at this, isn't she?<eos> Miss Volkoff.<eos> I'll admit I didn't see the family resemblance at first.<eos> But now...<eos> I see your father in you.
Are you Mette Rohde?<eos> Your husband's in there.<eos> - Saga Noren, Malmö County Police.<eos> - Nice to meet you.<eos> - Martin has told me a lot about you.
- In here.<eos> Mom, this is Sandy.<eos> I met her at Open Air in Hawaii, she was in group therapy with me.<eos> Come on in.<eos> I've heard so much about you.
Thank you for waiting.<eos> Thank you. Thank you, Ms. Wickett.<eos> My great auntie -- she, uh -- she passed last evening.<eos> Mm.<eos> And there are some staff -- they spoke very highly of you.
Good luck with your results.<eos> Make sure you all give me your supplements.<eos> Thank you Miss Naaz, it's been a great year.<eos> Thank you, Luv.<eos> Will think of you a lot. Take care.
Well done, you!<eos> America!<eos> Wonderful!<eos> You've been in a lot lately.<eos> Have I made an impression on you, then?
I'm gonna die.<eos> And some other doctor will come through here and replace me.<eos> Probably not your Doogie Howser but, you know, still...<eos> Look, I'm not going to beg you to do this trial.<eos> If you're too shortsighted to not take the chance just because you don't like my bedside manner, trust me--there are hundreds of people who are waiting to replace you.
OK, will do.<eos> Jackson, how was lunch?<eos> Jackson?<eos> I'm Gloria, the wife.<eos> I know. Graham talk about you.
Are you sure you have what it takes to be a detective inspector?<eos> I am, sir, yes.<eos> All my appraisals have been excellent.<eos> But those are the views of external observers.<eos> What do YOU think?
Yes.<eos> May I speak with you for a second, please?<eos> I'm Detective Ajayi, Nick's partner.<eos> Well, I see he, uh... Didn't mention me.<eos> Well, he's mentioned you -- A lot.
We need to make sure her arm's okay for the parade tomorrow.<eos> Betty is Brick's niece from Huntsville.<eos> She visits every summer.<eos> Betty, this is Dr. Hart from New York.<eos> Yes. I heard all out you.
Great.<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> Just tell your story truthfully.<eos> We'll be asking you questions off camera.<eos> I just want this to be as much about you as possible.
The Dark Curse.<eos> Are you sure, your majesty?<eos> You said you'd never use it.<eos> You made a deal when you gave away that curse.<eos> You traded it away. She won't be happy to see you.
I'm not in the book.<eos> Can I ask you a favor? Regina mentioned the kid's in therapy.<eos> Do you know where I can find the doctor?<eos> Hey.<eos> Emma Swan. I was, uh, just reading about you.
very complicated woman, and, uh, over the years, her attempts to try and bring Henry closer have only backfired.<eos> Why don't you take a look at the file?<eos> Um, see what I mean.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> Well, he talks about you a lot, and you're very important to him.
That I'm allowed a phone call.<eos> And a beer.<eos> You know what I'm thinking?<eos> No. How can you say that?<eos> Because I have never, at any time while I've been with you, known what you're thinking.
These men all happen to have gone through rough divorces, or tragic deaths of their wives.<eos> Each and every one of them was particularly fragile.<eos> Let's take a look at the potential matches you proffered these clients.<eos> Gee, what a surprise they all chose you.<eos> What do you think they saw in you, I wonder?
To sue me?<eos> You huff and puff so.<eos> You remind me of the big bad wolf.<eos> I do more than huff and puff.<eos> I did a little checking on you.
- I don't know if I'm comfortable with that.<eos> - Oh, no, no. Come on, Mrs. Martin, you've been so cooperative lately.<eos> Don't make me do this the hard way.<eos> What, you're gonna throw me in jail if I won't do it?<eos> No. No, but I know some things about you and Henry Butler that you want to keep quiet, and I'd just hate to start talking if I didn't have to.
I'm driving a car. I can't talk.<eos> Hey, remember Winston?<eos> Winston, it's my ma. Talk to her.<eos> Hey, what up, Mrs. Miller?<eos> You know, I wrote a poem about you.
I'm Dr. Sander Halvorson.<eos> Kate Lloyd.<eos> Yes. Do you know who I am?<eos> I do.<eos> Adam told me a little bit about you as well.
- Up there.<eos> Barry, will you come around with the car?<eos> We'll meet you out by the road.<eos> I can't do that, I'm afraid, Mrs. Lang.<eos> Have to stay with you at all times.
You've always loved that.<eos> Come on, Bran.<eos> You need to stay away from him.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> Fergal's told me a lot about you.
Because if my son dies... then you die.<eos> And so will all your friends.<eos> You understand this, lady.<eos> If you hurt any more of my friends...<eos> I'm gonna let your baby boy die right in front of you.
Only serious stuff now.<eos> - This looks like...<eos> - A real newspaper.<eos> They fired everybody.<eos> - I don't believe what they're saying about you.
Just like that, you're gone, and no one notices?<eos> Poor Orson.<eos> Well, take whatever you want.<eos> I'll have, uh, goodwill pick up the rest.<eos> You know, he spoke about you constantly.
I sensed him being a little dramatic. But withholding food?<eos> The whole thing started because he refused to say please...<eos> Which I know sounds rather petty, but you have to understand. He has been impossible lately.<eos> The man is facing life in a wheelchair.<eos> He's mad at the world, and unfortunately, he's taking it out on you.
The Zamboni machine.<eos> Open skate!<eos> Hi.<eos> How high are you?<eos> I'm fine, ma'am. How high are you?
I haven't spoken to him in almost a year. What difference does it make?<eos> Hello?<eos> We've never met, but I think you know who I am.<eos> My name's Bill Arnold.<eos> I think you know what I've been saying about you in Sacramento.
You'll see.<eos> Tell me.<eos> No.<eos> What's the matter with you?<eos> Junior mentioned you.
Stop writing.<eos> The books and life are not the same thing, most of the time.<eos> - Okay, Ms. Iwanaga, I'm all yours.<eos> - Excellent.<eos> Dr. Reichs' relationship with Agent Andy is based on you and Booth?
You want me to hold it while you tie your shoe?<eos> No, I want you to take it, just in case.<eos> All right. Let's go.<eos> I'm almost sad to see it come to an end, Agent Shaw.<eos> You know, I'd expected more from you.
Feel free to call if you have more.<eos> Wait!<eos> uh, you haven't given me the chance to... Ask you to dinner.<eos> You're crazy.<eos> crazy for you.
If she decides that Bobby's face is the blue plate special, I'd like to be there. Fine.<eos> See what else we can find out.<eos> Oops. Did I scare you?<eos> No. No. No.<eos> Nothing scary about you at all.
Almost too generous, which is why we're giving it back.<eos> I, uh, wonder what he'd do with a used dress.<eos> Anyway, you remember my dad from the gym, right?<eos> Well, that's what I wanted to talk to you about.<eos> You know I don't have a mom around, and I thought of you.
I thought you should know.<eos> Of course.<eos> I hope you did not speak with the soldier.<eos> Things are confused enough.<eos> I can understand that you might be concerned what people think of you.
Er, yes, we got the young lady's letter.<eos> But the trouble is, she didn't have any obvious experience of hard work.<eos> But she's a very hard worker!<eos> I couldn't find any proof of it.<eos> And she gave you as a reference, when you don't run a business, well, not that I'm aware of.
- I rather trusted to find the Earl here.<eos> I am leaving presently for France.<eos> He is a military man.<eos> I wanted some advice. - My husband is in council with the King.<eos> - Someone of my acquaintance has told me about you, painting such a picture of your virtues and your talents that I thought to make myself known to you.
[Speaking spanish]<eos> I told you we should have kept that bastard locked up.<eos> And i'm telling you for the last time, boyd, Go back on patrol.<eos> No decomposition. It's a new victim.<eos> He's becoming more focused on you, sheriff.
He's completely cleared.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Mm-hmm. So, uh, what's... Been going on?<eos> Why have you been so nice?<eos> I could ask the same about you.
These are for...<eos> Geriatric bladder control. Do I look geriatric?<eos> I could easily have a baby. I choose not to.<eos> These are for old, creaky people Who are way older than me.<eos> Not you. I'm sorry. I-I'm a little flustered.
Why are you fixing a bus?<eos> You are a highly educated and fairly intelligent young man.<eos> I gotta pay rent, save up for tuition.<eos> What happened to your fellowship?<eos> After you left, the new forensic anthropologist wasn't based at the Jeffersonian, he was in New York.
Pretty damn well.<eos> And secondly, my relationship with hank lawson is over.<eos> So the hospital board is finally going to have to find<eos> A new talking point.<eos> - Miss casey, dr. Lawson's waiting for you in your office.
I shouldn't have taken Edward to that party.<eos> Is that all you have to say?<eos> Jane's a great lawyer.<eos> She's gonna fix everything.<eos> Uh, I've heard a lot about you over the years, Mrs. Lee.
You knew the story about Edward's father was a lie.<eos> This is a family matter.<eos> Do you know what I love about your daughter?<eos> She speaks up, and she's not afraid of anything.<eos> And I think she got that from you.
I'm starting to get seasick. Agent Dunham?<eos> I thought that was you.<eos> Mrs. Clayton, how is Max doing?<eos> Doctors think you got there just in time.<eos> Now, he hasn't been able to stop talking about you.
And pushing spa treatments on them...<eos> Are simply not hallmarks of being professional.<eos> And professionalism is what this thing is all about.<eos> So thank you.<eos> But if I were you, I wouldn't wait by the phone.
That was the day I realized you would do anything.<eos> - Hank. - Oh, Divya, this is Eddie...<eos> Lawson.<eos> I am so happy to see you.<eos> I've heard a lot about you.
It wasn't us.<eos> That would've been a cop on a retainer.<eos> Mrs Murray, have you seen Professor Sinclair recently?<eos> Yes, I have.<eos> Did he happen to mention to you that he...he told us about you and he...
Very pleased to meet you.<eos> And this is...<eos> Melinda Wilson.<eos> Pleasure.<eos> I can't tell you what an honor it is to meet you--everything about you I love.
Fine.<eos> I can write articles.<eos> I've been offered a speaking tour.<eos> Plenty of people will pay me for this information.<eos> I'd be careful, if I were you.
I thought, wow, I'll stay at the door and see what happens!<eos> He came down and he understood I didn't want to play games.<eos> I didn't want him to say, you've got to take your clothes off now and pose in the nude.<eos> So he was so famous then? Yes, very.<eos> And what happened to you, did you get lots of attention?
Good day.<eos> - Please, sit down.<eos> Would you like something to drink? .<eos> Why I go to in early ...<eos> You know where the plugs are for you home for us and many others fit? .
She became a doctor, then founded a hospital for children.<eos> She inspired so many to follow in her footsteps, including my mother and me.<eos> We loved her very much.<eos> Let's get a cuppa, shall we, Angela?<eos> I want to hear lots more about your grandmother, and you.
Hi. Hello. Dr. Bennette.<eos> This is Allison Dubois.<eos> Um, you just treated me, it's Tuesday night.<eos> Uh, I just really want to thank you for coming down to the hospital, and, uh, for being so reassuring.<eos> And you know, there was something about you that I just thought we could be great friends.
If we end up with the wrong panel, we're screwed.<eos> Well, everybody else is ready, Mereta.<eos> We'll meet you out front.<eos> - Okay.<eos> That would look great on you.
If you decide to be helpful, let me know.<eos> And thank you so much for your contribution.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> Ms. Pierce, I was hoping to steal a minute of your time.<eos> I've heard so much about you.
- Oh, yes.<eos> No.<eos> That... that didn't happen.<eos> What a shame.<eos> He went on and on about you.
Ahem.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Claudia, this is Dr. Calder.<eos> Dr. Cal-- oh, Vanessa.<eos> Well, I've heard a lot about you. A lot.
Oh, uh... hi.<eos> Uh, you must be... Will.<eos> I'm doctor...<eos> Powell. Yes.<eos> Katie's told me everything about you.
No. They were so alike, their mannerisms in every way.<eos> They were the same cat.<eos> I'm sure they were!<eos> Ruth, no! Henry isn't missing.<eos> He never was. He's always been here with you.
Rebels.<eos> You must have intel on their local camps.<eos> Hola, Navaja.<eos> It's funny...<eos> Langley didn't say anything about you comin' down.
Quick side note. When a patient's eyes are open, that usually means that they're awake.<eos> Sorry, Mrs. Gallagher.<eos> You look very beautiful today.<eos> - Doesn't she?<eos> - Yeah, your jaundice makes you glow.
What's wrong?<eos> You know, I don't appreciate looking back on my life with someone I've known for two minutes.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean anything by that.<eos> I'm so sorry. That was unprofessional and bad timing.<eos> I don't presume to know anything about you.
The land is my grandfather's.<eos> I started cooking here as a child.<eos> I Iove cooking, but I'm not as good as you.<eos> Edo tells me the opposite.<eos> He always talks about you.
Okay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> By the way, you made quite an impression at the poker game.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Oh, yeah. The ladies can't stop talking about you.
I just need to make sure it's not me.<eos> - It's not you.<eos> - Are you sure?<eos> Trust me, I used to work in construction.<eos> My buddies would have gone crazy for you.
They just magically open for them, don't they?<eos> Oh, this is my boyfriend, Dan Humphrey. - Hi.<eos> - Dan, this is Ms. Carr.<eos> - She's my favorite new teacher.<eos> - I've heard a lot about you.
That's why I'm calling.<eos> Did you know the school has tickets to the opera tonight? - To the opera?<eos> No, I didn't know that.<eos> - Oh, yes. It's a gala event.<eos> My family, who's heard all about you, asked if you could come to dinner and then join us in our grand-tier seats afterwards.
I am merely following the correct...<eos> Which does lead me to wonder whether your enthusiasm for the benefits of improvement only exists when there is also a benefit for James Dowland.<eos> It doesn't really matter what I do, does it, Miss Lane?<eos> In your eyes, my motivations will never be anything other than base.<eos> I had thought better of you than that.
But what happens from this moment on...<eos> Either with me or against me.<eos> It's a real pleasure to meet you, sir.<eos> I've heard a lot about you.<eos> And I you, Alex.
Stop,Caitlyn.<eos> Just stop.<eos> He knows everything.<eos> Justin-- at the request of his counsel-- became quite talkative when I took the death penalty off the table.<eos> He shared some very interesting information about you.
Ruth Boddicker.<eos> This is my boss, District Attorney Manuel Devalos.<eos> It's a great pleasure to meet you, sir.<eos> And you, Miss Boddicker.<eos> I read about you in the papers this morning.
Although,I couldn't for the life of me figure out why you,uh,called me and not Jim.<eos> Well,actually, there is some news,of a sort.<eos> Are you familiar with Mrs. Dubois here?<eos> I know the two of you have spoken, but have you heard about who she is,what she does?<eos> Well,I didn't when we first met, but,uh,my husband told me about you this morning.
- Yeah.<eos> That's my mother.<eos> Ms. Thornton.<eos> Maryann Forrester.<eos> I've heard all about you.
Why does he get to decide what I look like?<eos> - Is that why you killed him? - What?<eos> - Dr. Leeds was murdered last week.<eos> - Murdered?<eos> A couple of days after you were released from the psychiatric treatment facility that Leeds helped commit you to.
Yes.<eos> I have seen him myself.<eos> He is tall, with very dark hair but piercing blue eyes.<eos> I am sure that your mother, god rest her soul, Would have approved.<eos> And everyone at court is talking about you.
They are not my priority at the moment.<eos> I'm currently more concerned with apprehending the person Who is depraved and disturbed enough To drag someone around from the bumper of their car.<eos> [ sighs ] Well, i'm sorry.<eos> Uh... Maybe you've never had a case like this.<eos> [ echoing ] it stays with you.
But, look, amazement on thy mother sits.<eos> O, step between her and her fighting soul.<eos> Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works.<eos> Speak to her, Hamlet.<eos> How is it with you, lady?
- You do remind me a little of Hooch.<eos> Sexy, sexy.<eos> Ladies I love it, I love it sexy, sexy is not a crime.<eos> What's so special about world-famous mystery novelist Richard Castle?<eos> He's rich, he's handsome, and he is basing his next best-seller on you.
- Well, perhaps one day you shall.<eos> Good morning, gentlemen.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Miss Olson, one of our copywriters.<eos> I know everything about you. You are a very impressive young woman.
- hey. what have you got?<eos> Well, the tainted blood units all came from the overnight shift at the blood banks.<eos> there were 2 techs on duty.<eos> we're taking them down to the lightman group right now for questioning.<eos> dr. cho, i haven't forgotten about you.
D- do you know her or...<eos> Yeah. that's my mom.<eos> Come on.<eos> Lisa's told me all about you.<eos> She, uh, didn't tell me, uh, a lot about you.
Yeah. that's my mom.<eos> Come on.<eos> Lisa's told me all about you.<eos> She, uh, didn't tell me, uh, a lot about you.<eos> But, uh... But I already know a I-lot about you, so...
Is it true? Ms. Reed?<eos> What they're saying, is it true?<eos> Look, I can't go into details, but there's evidence that Jake was trying to steal information.<eos> Then it was all an act?<eos> Now that... that doesn't mean he didn't care about you. That's exactly what it means.
- What?<eos> You're a good person, and you're right, you are a mother, but Danielle is a mother now, too.<eos> And I believe that you want what's best for your daughter, but sometimes, even when we mean well, we end up hurting people.<eos> I'm just saying, think about Danielle.<eos> Think about what Danielle thinks about you.
I must say, Fräulein, I should be rather annoyed with you.<eos> I arrive in France and I wish to have lunch with my star. Little do I know he's become the toast of Paris. And now he must find time for me.<eos> People wait in line hours, days to see me.<eos> For the Führer and Private Zoller, I wait.<eos> So finally, I'm granted an audience with the young Private. And he spends the entire lunch speaking of you and your cinema.
- Mark is all right?<eos> - Mark is fine.<eos> Please.<eos> - I've heard so much about you.<eos> - As I have about you.
I have to tell you, that much of this is ridiculous at first I thought, you wanted to join the team furthermore, you looked right and then I quickly realised we were being taken for fools<eos> Then I hired Vance.<eos> - he has magic hands!<eos> I understand everything. you and your friends is that you don't share.<eos> This does not apply to you
- Yes.<eos> Okay.<eos> Oh my God.<eos> - Let me tell you something.<eos> All three of you are old enough to know better and I'm especially disappointed in you.
Fortenberry, you shouldn't have.<eos> You poor child.<eos> I am so sorry for your loss.<eos> That's very kind of you.<eos> Um...gran often talked about you, so...
- It's all I can think about. - Really?<eos> Hi there.<eos> Hello there.<eos> You must be Tillie.<eos> - I've certainly heard a lot about you.
She's the one who thinks you killed mommy.<eos> Mr. Darling.<eos> What--what can i do for you?<eos> I'm Connie Dallamuir.<eos> I've heard a lot about you.
Well, the newspaperswere very definite about what it was I didfor the district attorney.<eos> You really thinkwe can get away with pretendingI'm not what I am?<eos> To be blunt, allison, I don't believe you arewhat you say you are.<eos> Not exactly.<eos> Now, that's not to saythat I think you're a fraud... but if I were to accept everythingI hear about you, well, that would make mequestion too many of my dearly heldassumptions about the world.
Morning.<eos> I've a parcel to send for Mr Wardup.<eos> You must be Patty.<eos> I'm Miss Lane.<eos> I've heard all about you, ma'am.
Come in.<eos> Good day. Hello.<eos> I'm Um Nasser, Mussa's mother in law.<eos> Hello, Um Nasser.<eos> Mussa told me about you.
The way you've crossed boundaries, mixing your personal and your professional life shows an alarming lack of judgment and ethical integrity.<eos> It would be remiss of me if I didn't file the proper notice.<eos> I'm shocked that you feel that way.<eos> Really?<eos> Knowing what I've heard about you, it doesn't surprise me at all.
Honey, you shouldn't be here.<eos> Mom, come on.<eos> Your daughter just wants to help.<eos> Detective, my mother was very disturbed, and I've had to accept that whatever made her that way might be in us.<eos> You and Liza, you mean.
Well,thank you,sir.<eos> I have to say it's been a long time since anyone's taken my dreams so seriously, especially here in the District Attorney's office.<eos> Well, shame on them for ignoring your talents.<eos> I would never be so obtuse.<eos> I know what I have in you.
- Hey, Mrs. T.<eos> - Hey.<eos> I just wanted to...<eos> You've done a lot for me...<eos> You've been there for me, and you've... always come through.
Roy didn't say a word.<eos> Good lord.<eos> Even my husband didn't leave me anything like that.<eos> Oh, I don't feel right taking this.<eos> Roy must have cared for you very much.
Time of death?<eos> I won't know exactly until I get the confession.<eos> All right, well, uh, I'll watch then.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Theresa's parents haven't asked for a lawyer, but they do want to be in the room while you talk to her.
And what will become of the man I know as Manuel Rivera?<eos> Well, I have an FBI agent here, if Manuel wants to be supplied with a new identity.<eos> But you're an expert in immigration.<eos> And if there's one thing our government has successfully proven that it can't do at all, it's find illegal aliens.<eos> I'll keep you in my prayers.
Oh, General Mansfield.<eos> You sure don't make my job easy, do you, Carter?<eos> - Where's Thorne?<eos> - General, I can explain.<eos> Dr. Blake, I have no evidence that you've been insubordinate.
A cover for who?<eos> The CIA.<eos> You weren't easy to find, Mr. Whittier.<eos> Means I'm fairly good at my job, Agent Young.<eos> Means you are, too, I may say.
No, ma'am, it's not.<eos> Carlos, what are you doing home?<eos> Uh, virginia insisted on giving me a ride.<eos> You must be gabrielle.<eos> Carlos has told me so much about you.
Why?<eos> Maybe he was low.<eos> He was down, and he didn't want you to see him like that, in pain, weak... as less than a man.<eos> He has his pride, so, uh, he turned away.<eos> It's not right, but it... it doesn't mean he doesn't care about you.
I was just trying it on for fun.<eos> Sorry. Larissa said you were going out, and I could leave this with her.<eos> I forgot to include it in the garment bag with your dress.<eos> But clearly, I don't even think you need it.<eos> This dress looks so great on you.
- but it was some miles from London.<eos> - It would have been.<eos> And you are acquainted with Lizzy how?<eos> Known Elizabeth for years.<eos> Until yesterday I had not heard of you.
Sorry...<eos> Ms. Lin... well...<eos> Dammit...<eos> Ms. Masumoto!<eos> I'm Shirizawa; I've interviewed you in the past.
Ms. Masumoto!<eos> I'm Shirizawa; I've interviewed you in the past.<eos> I've forgotten about it.<eos> I'm Shirizawa from Truth Magazine.<eos> I've interviewed you in the past.
He has advanced stage lung cancer.<eos> I just wanna be sure.<eos> Then let me ask him.<eos> You wouldn't believe...<eos> I was thinking of you.
- You're hard to kill.<eos> The Bug is big.<eos> We have lock.<eos> Captain Beck.<eos> I've heard a lot about you.
Oh, my God.<eos> We think whoever killed him might have been on that rooftop.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I know.<eos> So, naturally, when we heard that you...
Abel's wife...<eos> Faunia.<eos> He never calls me his mother.<eos> Welcome.<eos> No one's ever mentioned you.
Fine example for healthcare workers.<eos> Still, I suppose smoking serves a purpose.<eos> - Thins the herd. Weeds out the stupid.<eos> - Are you speaking to me?<eos> Yeah, but I was having a go at them, not you.
Mrs. Rook, now stop it!<eos> Even now, they've said that the Cabinet's gone into seclusion.<eos> What does that mean, seclusion?<eos> - How should I know?<eos> - But I've got plenty of research on you.
This is Detective Lee Scanlon.<eos> - Detective.<eos> - Pleasure.<eos> And over here is Allison Dubois from my office.<eos> I think I read about you on the plane.
They're an awful nuisance is what they are.<eos> Are you Detective Rush?<eos> Yes.<eos> And you are?<eos> Emma Stone. My Women's Studies professor mentioned you in a lecture.
Yes, it's the logo of my husband's law firm.<eos> Why draw it across Nakamura's face?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Because we did something terrible, and now someone wants revenge.<eos> Would anyone want revenge on him, maybe... on you?
Kind of getting used to a lot of drop-ins.<eos> Mm. Too many?<eos> Oh, you know.<eos> They mean well, but, uh, sometimes you just wanna be alone.<eos> People care about you.
May I, Your Honor?<eos> My client keeps a hidden security camera in his office.<eos> As you can see, the People illegally obtained a sample of my client's hair prior to his arrest.<eos> We had ample justification for arresting Mr. Holbrook.<eos> Be that as it may, Ms. Devlin, this is the kind of stunt I'd expect from Mr. Stark, not you.
- I'm on the cusp.<eos> - No, you're not. - It's a gray area.<eos> - Min!<eos> And this is Katherine Reimer, I'm sure Tom's mentioned her.<eos> I've heard a lot about you, Mrs Jackman.
I mean, who says "pray tell"?<eos> Druitt was the same. Proper use of the Queen's English is a lost art.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Let's just forget about the very disturbing fact that you have a basement full of monsters and your butler shoudn't exist.<eos> Let's talk about you and this guy, ok?
I'm not sure.<eos> But your killer has an intimate knowledge of the human anatomy.<eos> You should be looking for someone with a medical background.<eos> A coincidence?<eos> Bumping into a dead body, outside your apartment, who, it turns out, happens to be the same man recently acquitted of raping you?
- You were very close, right?<eos> Well,yeah. I mean,all little girls love their grandmas, right?<eos> No. No,this affection caused a rift.<eos> A problem.<eos> Uh,your mother's war with her got turned against you.
- You said it twice.<eos> - Hodgins. I quote, literally to the letter:<eos> "Ever has it been that love does not know its own depth until the pain of separation."<eos> The guy writes poetry.<eos> - Please. He was talking about you, Miss Montenegro, with tears in his eyes.
You are a very dedicated investigator.<eos> I have something I didn't want to say in front of Dr Hodgkins.<eos> - Hodgins.<eos> There's no K.<eos> - Your husband is deeply in love with you.
We found jewelry from your store with a kanji that matches the tattoo on your back.<eos> We also found a hair-- a red hair-- caught in the prongs of a broken ring.<eos> Your hair is red.<eos> I don't know her.<eos> I'd get rid of that cat if I were you.
But marriage...<eos> Marriage nails a man, Martha.<eos> And schemes such as this, with lodgers...?<eos> I'm sorry. I'm that flummoxed.<eos> I hope you don't think my dismay reflects my opinion of you, madam.
- Thank you.<eos> You are Carol.<eos> Carol Bennell, this is Dr. Henryk Belicec and his wonderful wife, Luddie.<eos> Come here and let me see you.<eos> Ben has told us a lot about you.
You're doing great.<eos> What am I doing?<eos> Try and steady your breathing, hon.<eos> Hi. I'm Francine Pomatter.<eos> Jim's told me so much about you.
Obviously, you're dealing with some inconsistencies.<eos> Well, yeah. I wake up every morning to find my husband has died again. I think that goes just a little beyond inconsistent.<eos> How do you feel during the times he's dead?<eos> What?<eos> I mean, what kind of emotions run through you?
- Yes.<eos> - So, it's you then, Camille?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Thank you for the scarf.<eos> - Franck has told me a lot about you.
James's sister.<eos> James's sister!<eos> How do you do, Miss Morland?<eos> I have so long wished to meet you.<eos> Your brother has spoken of you so affectionately.
Miss Morland...<eos> I might not have been completely straight with you, but I had good reason.<eos> You think of your brother's happiness, and Isabella's.<eos> They couldn't go off unchaperoned.<eos> And I was thinking of you, too.
I think it's a very good thing, too.<eos> I'm so pleased to hear you say that.<eos> Did you ever hear the old song, "going to one wedding brings on another"?<eos> Perhaps you and I might try the truth ofthat?<eos> I shall think of you, when I'm in town!
!<eos> We had a deal, Varg.<eos> Why didn't you tell me Karsten and Bård were friends?<eos> - That's no secret.<eos> - Bård knew about you and Karsten.
- Mrs. Kent?<eos> I'm Lois Lane.<eos> - From the Daily Pl...<eos> - I know who you are, Miss Lane.<eos> My son talks about you quite often.
Listen, I, uh, I forgot something somewhere so I'm going to just go...<eos> Robin, this is my mom, Janice.<eos> Oh, honey. I'm so glad to finally meet you.<eos> Me too.<eos> I, I've heard so much about you.
Sooner or later, charles must surrender, and leave Italy altogether.<eos> That is truly excellent news.<eos> Ah! Your excellence, allow me to introduce is this not mademoiselle anne?<eos> Enchant?<eos> His eminence,cardinal wolsey, has told me all about you.
John?<eos> Madeline Evelley. I recognize you from all the photographs.<eos> I'm Hank's mom.<eos> It's so nice to meet you, ma'am.<eos> Hank was always talking about you.
Milena.<eos> Oh, Michael. I'm sorry, I didn't ask your name.<eos> Catherine Tramell. Milena Gardosh.<eos> Oh, you're Dr. Gardosh.<eos> I've heard so many wonderful thingsNabout you.
You look well.<eos> I'm sorry, Suzanne, this is my ex-wife, Deirdre.<eos> And, Deirdre, this is my fiancée, Suzanne.<eos> Hello. It's nice to meet you.<eos> I've heard so much about you.
-Yes.<eos> My name's Hope Cassidy. I believe Mr. Hamit said I was coming?<eos> It's a pleasure to have you here.<eos> -Simit? -No, thank you.<eos> Mr. Hamit has spoken greatly about you.
Your mother's death certificate.<eos> Can you read Russian?<eos> No.<eos> Olga Kaidanovsky.<eos> Apparently, she was murdered just after you were born.
It was considerate of you to come and pay your respects, Miss Potter.<eos> Our mother is particularly moved, and is sorry she isn't well enough to come down to greet you.<eos> I'll be taking over our late brother's business affairs, Miss Potter.<eos> Fine.<eos> I want to assure you that F Warne and company will do everything in its power to ensure that our tragic loss causes you the least possible inconvenience.
go home, to Bosnia.<eos> You can't do that.<eos> I mother Aida.<eos> But we raised her.<eos> She doesn't know about you.
- Transfer me to Jack Bauer on a clean line. - Why Jack?<eos> - That's not your concern.<eos> You're getting to Jack through me. That makes it my concern.<eos> I'm going through you because I know you have a special relationship with Bauer.<eos> I know all about you, which is why I'm counting on you to recognise an opportunity when it presents itself.
If we left now, you could be back at work at 3:15, put in a couple of hours, inspect, what, 90, maybe a hundred shirts.<eos> But I took the day off.<eos> No, no, no, no. You don't wanna do that.<eos> No. You're Inspector Number 8.<eos> You have a lot of people depending on you.
Can I validate your parking ?<eos> But Ms. St. George please, if you would just give me a chance ?<eos> Look, I know I have what it takes to be on TV.<eos> I own three of them !<eos> I also know everything about you.
About his future.<eos> So have I.<eos> - I don't believe you.<eos> - It's true.<eos> That's how I knew about you, about the dump.
Failure is not fatal.<eos> It's the courage to continue that counts.<eos> And I think you've got that in spades. - Churchill?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Except for that last part about you.
And I do not allow the men I hire to abuse the women.<eos> I'm sorry, but i do not believe this man works here.<eos> Miss, the man we're looking for wouldn't be openly abusive.<eos> He might just like following women around and peeking into women's bathrooms, That sort of thing.<eos> He would be shy with women, specially you.
I will do everything in my power to persuade him.<eos> Why should we trust you?<eos> Because we are willing to trust you.<eos> By extending this offer, we are jeopardizing our very existence.<eos> I saw in you compassion, Dr. Weir, someone who could come to understand our plight.
Haven't seen you in a while.<eos> You look different.<eos> - I gained a little weight.<eos> - Is that what it is?<eos> - Looks good on you.
That's my fiancée.<eos> He died last year in Iraq.<eos> But I don't understand.<eos> This man, Corporal Price, I don't know him.<eos> No, but, uh, I think he knew about you.
Your husband had a big spirit, didn't he?<eos> Oh, yes. He certainly did.<eos> Look. Nothing can replace him.<eos> You can't bring him back.<eos> But you have his spirit with you always.
Edward, the redoubtable Mrs. Harper.<eos> An honour, ma'am.<eos> And my step-sister, Antoinette Cosway.<eos> It's a pleasure to meet you at last, Miss Cosway.<eos> Richard has spoken of you often. Oh. Really?
- No. She was a perfect angel.<eos> She won every competition, even her first one.<eos> And after that, it was music and dance classes.<eos> - She was a real competitor.<eos> - And when she won, it reflected well on you.
I experienced some kind of a blackout.<eos> We need to change our plea.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no!<eos> She's insane.<eos> What do you think Mrs Wilkes loved most about you?
In love.<eos> I will never get over her.<eos> What did you love about her if I may ask?<eos> She was pretty with pleasing personality.<eos> What do you think Ms. Wilkes love most about you?
Susan is very good.<eos> I thought she would be.<eos> With you as her example.<eos> You're too kind, Mr. Rivers.<eos> Who could not be... with you to be kind to?
Possibilities drive us.<eos> What they said was impossible, I knew could be done.<eos> I applied for a research grant with a company called CJN Co.<eos> They handed out money and left me alone. Your actual dream come true, until I finished developing TAMI.<eos> Then why haven't I heard of you?
Make them all hundreds, please.<eos> Are you all right, sir?<eos> Uh, yeah.<eos> Listen, did we just have a conversation?<eos> About you? Whatever you say.
That's all I know, I swear. - She?<eos> What did she look like?<eos> - Oh, Miss Hart, would you mind?<eos> - Oh, I'm actually in a hurry.<eos> - Is it true you're seeing Prince William?
I don't give a shit about being politically incorrect.<eos> Fine, let's arrest them, just as soon as you answer one more question.<eos> Why would anyone want to take your daughter?<eos> What makes her so special?<eos> What makes you so special?
The Lord Chamberlain was very pleased.<eos> I wanted you to meet Natalie.<eos> - Natalie?<eos> - My wife.<eos> Vivian's spoken about you sooften, I just feel that I know you.
He particularly wants you to meet his sister.<eos> His sister.<eos> Miss Elizabeth!<eos> My sister, Miss Georgiana.<eos> My brother has told me so much about you,
Giovanna.<eos> Luisa.<eos> Francesca.<eos> You're all these women?<eos> - They're all inside of you?
Just when I was beginning to enjoy myself.<eos> I imagine that you are 15 years old.<eos> I'm exactly 3 times 15.<eos> And you?<eos> I dreamed about you, a couple of times.
I'll allow it.<eos> Did she break your heart?<eos> Yes.<eos> You were in love with her.<eos> Now, Ms Rogers... during the two years that you were together with my client, do you feel that she was in love with you?
It was storybook, it really was.<eos> Yeah, but now you had two big problems. / Yes.<eos> One, what to do about Eddie.<eos> And two, falling in love when it was still 1945.<eos> Did Eddie know about you and Clyde?
I'm sure you gave them a thorough going over. But some of my colleagues, several of them, in fact, they... They may want to make a show of things.<eos> Ah. A little bit of, "Next time she'll remember which side her bread is buttered on,"<eos> that sort of thing. You know what I mean.<eos> Not really.<eos> You don't even look tired.
- That's the way they like it.<eos> Your husband's family chartered the agency to pin his dying on you... so when you're jailed or hanged, they can bag your gold.<eos> How do you support this contention?<eos> Oh, she's come to me.<eos> Wants to give me money... to confirm what she says you confessed, that you hired me to kill him.
I'm afraid that's classified, ma'am.<eos> Sergeant, Colonel McNulty has been evading me since this inquiry began.<eos> But if the IG's office let every target of an investigation hide behind their job, we wouldn't be very effective at keeping this place honest, would we?<eos> He is not purposely avoiding you, ma'a<eos> I'm sorry, I don't mean to take this out on you.
I just wanted to let you know that Carnell's prepped for surgery.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hi, I'm Allison Cameron.<eos> I work with your son.<eos> Greg's told us all about you.
On a typical day, I might interview a witness or witnesses involved in a possible crime.<eos> I might be asked to take statements from such witnesses.<eos> On occasion, I've been asked to monitor interrogation of suspects.<eos> You do all that for the District Attorney without a law degree?<eos> - There must be something very special about you .
Then take this wall out.<eos> Don't make me go out there!<eos> Let's do it!<eos> You're gonna be fine.<eos> I'm gonna be right here with you.
I'll be conducting this deposition.<eos> Hi.<eos> Uh, where do you want us to sit?<eos> Actually, Miss Roberts can't be present.<eos> We wouldn't want you influencing your testimony.
This is the last time I give you an order twice.<eos> Understood.<eos> You must be Teyla.<eos> And you are Colonel Everett.<eos> Major Sheppard spoke highly of you in his report.
I'm very sorry for your loss, Paige.<eos> Director Fitzgerald.<eos> Specia Agent Samantha Spade.<eos> Of course.<eos> Martin told us about you.
What were you saying to her?<eos> Nothing<eos> Merely passing the time of day I don't like your speaking to her<eos> She is a very agreeable young woman, and I believe she loves you dearly<eos> I wonder what she would think of you if she heard of your disgrace
He cooks.<eos> You never told me he cooks.<eos> Yes, well, it's been a strange couple of days.<eos> I'm sure she'll come around, don't worry. Shouldn't I be saying that to you?<eos> Yes, oh, I've enjoyed reading about you in the society pages.
Whenever you come here I must fix the gravel.<eos> As for the gravel, it is a question about style.<eos> A letter for the young lady.<eos> Ironworks R. Leprince, Paris 1920 July 25.<eos> Young lady, I take advantage of Sunday today to write to you with respect to your announcement where it says that you are looking for Célestin Poux and other survivors of Bingo twilight.
Well, I was looking for something for my wife.<eos> What is it, a special occasion?<eos> It's our second third anniversary.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Hello, Mrs. Diaz, we were just talking about you.
But you could do without this.<eos> No!<eos> Flor, never do fetch to Chum! Never!<eos> I'm not mad.<eos> I'm thinking of you.
- Tell us about him. Now, Ulloa... you're gonna fall in a deep sleep.<eos> And you won't think about anything.<eos> You didn't understand anything, absolutely nothing.<eos> You don't overcome a trauma with a lie, it's not ethic.<eos> I'm not asking for you opinion, lady.
You're just not used to Italian fashions, that's all.<eos> No, I'm sure your wife is on the mark.<eos> Mrs Erlynne is a notorious Jezebel.<eos> That's a slanderous statement.<eos> If you can't back it up, I wouldn't repeat it.
When he ...<eos> He was moved to another camp, but he was fine when I saw him.<eos> He'll make it.<eos> Would you like some cake?<eos> We were together for a long time and he told me about Gustav and about you, of course.
You look like his type, "so... "<eos> No. Not his type. Or his wife.<eos> Just his friend and his customer.<eos> - It's still good to meet you.<eos> - You, too. Luke's told me a lot about you.
I figure she was on the eighth hole when I paged her.<eos> You probably got another half hour.<eos> I ran a T.S.H., T3 and T4.<eos> The patient's negative for hypothyroidism.<eos> I'm not talking about you.
How do... how do you people do it?<eos> Joan.<eos> My mother always said I was too mean to die.<eos> I guess she wasn't far off.<eos> Mrs. Washington, I was there when you were shot.
And what about you?<eos> Me, no.<eos> I haven't really listened to the pop rock 'n' roll since, uh...<eos> - Ever. That's about right.<eos> Ever. But I have heard of you.
- Blonde hair.<eos> - Yes, raspy voice.<eos> - That incision's healing up nicely.<eos> - Thanks again, Dr Miller.<eos> I'm gonna have my band write a song about you.
The girl is sick.<eos> Very sick.<eos> She needs treatment.<eos> If she's here in Smallville, I'm sure you'll find out about it.<eos> I'll expect a call from you.
Still, a man should always respect his wife.<eos> This is...<eos> - Sophie Newman.<eos> - Sophie, this is my boss, Emre Celenk.<eos> - I've heard about you.
Yes, they were.<eos> Was Ozal aware of this?<eos> Sometimes he became paranoid - he thought Celenk might try to kill him.<eos> I put that down to excessive cocaine use.<eos> What did MI5 hope to gain by you accompanying Celenk to Frankfurt?
What were you doing?<eos> I was replacing a defective bug that had been providing us with a lot of useful secondary intelligence.<eos> So when you returned from Frankfurt, the new bug was up and running?<eos> Yes.<eos> So where are the tapes for the period after you returned from Frankfurt?
Hello. - Hi.<eos> Oh... Samantha Carter, this is Kianna Cyr.<eos> This is...<eos> Sam Carter. - She helps me out on the translations.<eos> - I've heard a lot about you.
The Prometheus incident.<eos> I know that the Air Force insisted on their own crew for that reason.<eos> You might be sensing reluctance from people to put themselves on a pedestal.<eos> We are just doing our jobs.<eos> Just a job? Consider it my job to put you on a pedestal. This job looks to me to be extraordinary, and, from what I read in your file, the same can be said about you personally.
- Sake?<eos> - Ah. Sake.<eos> Cheers.<eos> May all your daughters be born with three bottoms.<eos> Now then, perhaps you can explain how it is... that I run into you at two crime scenes... and then can't find any record of you on a single government computer.
Even so, with such a large line of credit...<eos> Sir.<eos> I'm sorry you had to go through that, Miss Selkirk.<eos> What was on that sheet?<eos> I thought he should know how much we're making off you.
He's dead.<eos> The Gestapo came for him.<eos> And if they catch you, they'll execute everyone who helped you, including me.<eos> I'm taking you back.<eos> You'll go to Želary, marry Janda, and I won't ever hear about you again.
Tommy, come here for a second.<eos> You are so beautiful.<eos> -This is Katherine Watson.<eos> -Oh, wow! In the flesh.<eos> -She has not shut up about you.
Oh, you look beautiful.<eos> Oh, my sweet.<eos> So this is the übermensch?<eos> Pleased to meet you, Mrs. Plath.<eos> Sylvia's told me a lot about you.
Mi scusi.<eos> You are looking for the American writer who lives here, and you found her.<eos> If you don't mind, I'll just...<eos> There.<eos> It was crawling on you.
I'm sure we can get a lot of parts.<eos> I love you.<eos> - Well, that's nice.<eos> - This is very serious, Mrs. Groden.<eos> I am in love with you deeply, so deeply.
-Will it heal me?<eos> No.<eos> Only the power heals us.<eos> You do believe in the power, don't you?<eos> - I see it in you, ma'am.
I wonder you'd realized how angry was Madame Crale with her husband for his treatment of you?<eos> - How very touching.<eos> When Philip Blake encountered her coming out of the library...<eos> - Good morning. - It's too cruel, too cruel.<eos> ... it was of you she was thinking.
My Goodness, I just can't help you.<eos> I can manage it.<eos> Not only Ken, you have me too.<eos> What's up?<eos> Miss Shek, I have fallen for you at the first sight.
Then we move.<eos> I'm gonna need a chopper to Fort Lewis.<eos> I'll check with the duty officer.<eos> Lauren Reed.<eos> Director Lindsey's told me all about you.
I have an appointment.<eos> We don't make appointments in the ER.<eos> Report your complaint to the Triage nurse.<eos> I believe special arrangements were made by Alderman Bright?<eos> Jonathan has nothing but wonderful things to say about you.
- I won't do that.<eos> - Why the hell not?<eos> I have Pa'nar Syndrome. It doesn't make a difference how I contracted it.<eos> It makes a lot of difference. You're not a member of this minority.<eos> He forced himself on you.
You should excuse me, Father, but he was a slimeball.<eos> My husband, John-- he's a sweet, sweet man.<eos> I gotta tell you, I'm real nervous about seeing my son.<eos> I actually thought to call and cancel.<eos> I'll be with you every step.
His whole life is controlled by the will of this rotten convict.<eos> What are the spiders doing, Peter?<eos> (Peter) They carry binary information.<eos> Once they're all assembled, they'll wipe you out.<eos> I wouldn't do that if I were you.
I'm beginning to think that the only way to be happy is to find something outside ourselves worth caring about and to work for that.<eos> Do you mean charity? It's hard to explain.<eos> It's about using your unhappiness to help you see other people's pain.<eos> But you do care something for me.<eos> I care very much about you.
I must say, she bears her troubles very well.<eos> Yes, she does.<eos> There seems to be hardly any need for me to say things when you know everything I'm thinking.<eos> So miss Lapidoth is your good cause now and you have forsaken me.<eos> No, I have not forsaken you.
And you thought it might be true and you came to see if you could find out.<eos> I never believed it.<eos> Please.<eos> I never believed it.<eos> I know he cares about you very much.
- What was that?<eos> - It's a tape recorder.<eos> - I can't understand anything! - Wait a minute.<eos> Let's try this.<eos> I'm the one who translates for you. I was there when the doctor treated you.
No, we just roommates.<eos> I mean, he never felt good enough to say much.<eos> I just hated to see what was left of him go away so easy.<eos> Seemed like an all right guy.<eos> Mentioned you a lot.
You must be very brave to mention his name.<eos> Or very foolish.<eos> Fear of a name only increases fear of the thing itself.<eos> And you must be Miss Granger.<eos> Yes, Draco has told me all about you. And your parents.
Oh, sorry.<eos> Old habits. You know, i'm a little surprised to see you here What with you storming out on me.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Me too. Gretchen rania, mr. Profit's chief-Of-Staff.<eos> Your uncle talks about you nonstop.
Oh, right, of course.<eos> You didn't really think she's my...<eos> - lt's my hair. I have mom hair.<eos> - No.<eos> I have heard of you, Miss Summers, you graduated from the old high school, right?
- What's wrong?<eos> - There's someone in here.<eos> It's only me.<eos> No. lt's not.<eos> You know, I have to be honest, I actually know a little bit more about you than I let on before.
- Oh... great.<eos> Wow.<eos> Nice flat.<eos> You must be Sally.<eos> Celestine told me about you.
Want to see your gite when it was full of cows?<eos> My father planting my pear tree, the day I was born, in the orchard.<eos> The cherry tree was planted for my wedding.<eos> If you have kids, plant fruit trees for them.<eos> They'll think of you when they eat the fruit.
Follow my voice.<eos> My voice is leading you.<eos> Keep your eyes fixed, watch this object.<eos> Focus your eyes.<eos> The power of the whole people will concentrate in you.
Ease your way past the security gate, and then take us to the portal station at 34th and Maybell.<eos> Got it?<eos> Where the hell am I?<eos> Zack Winslow was working on an alien project. What was it?<eos> I guess those rumours I heard about you going down the deep end are true. Because I don't have a clue, what you're talking about.
Mr and Mrs Welsborough, I really am most terribly sorry to hear about your daughter.<eos> - Son. - Son!<eos> Mr and Mrs Welsborough, this is Mr Sherlock Holmes.<eos> Thank you very much for coming.<eos> We've heard a great deal about you.
As you know, your brother, Harry S. Truman, is my godfather.<eos> I heard he is ill.<eos> I came to pay my respects to my godfather and extend my best wishes for his recovery, which I hope will be swift and painless.<eos> It's an honor to see you again.<eos> You know... my heart is always here with you and these fine people, my parents, who I love so dearly.
You're the Hand.<eos> And I'm gonna make sure...<eos> Mr. Rand.<eos> I appreciate your candor. And your passion.<eos> And I must say, considering what I've heard about you, you seem much more disciplined than I anticipated.
I can wait.<eos> But Mr Delaney's son knew nothing of any marriage.<eos> How would he?<eos> He was in Africa.<eos> But he often spoke of you.
I received a message that you wished to speak with me.<eos> After you have eluded me so long.<eos> May I sit?<eos> I need to know why you're seeking me?<eos> First, I must tell you that I already know many things about you.
Here's to you, dougie.<eos> Mr. Jackpots!<eos> Oh. This is the man I told you about.<eos> I wanted to see you again.<eos> I've thought of you every day, What you did for me.
Okay, you know what? You both look beautiful.<eos> Really.<eos> Sir, before you get dragged into the hubbub there, I want to introduce you to Sean Cullen here.<eos> Sean's the writer from Rolling Stone.<eos> He's been doing that profile piece on you.
Where are you?<eos> Listen...<eos> I love you.<eos> I don't know what an actor can do to help put the memory of my son to rest.<eos> But he obviously thought highly of you.
In real life, it's all legwork or paperwork, asking the same questions over and over.<eos> Would you...? Would you like me to change the music?<eos> I gather opera's more your bag.<eos> Look, don't think too badly of her.<eos> Dorothea holds you in some regard.
His wife wants to tell her children.<eos> I understand that.<eos> She can't.<eos> Sir, imagine if we were talking about your children,<eos> - about you...
What's going on with you?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Lobo tells me you're about a day away from getting the tube.<eos> You've been making progress, but you can't stay at Threshold if you drop any more weight.<eos> I just think it's so weird that you know everything about me... and I don't know anything about you.
I'm sorry, with all the new construction in town, we really must enforce the rules.<eos> All right, Timothy, I know that you're new here.<eos> This is a small town.<eos> We take care of each other.<eos> I've heard a lot about you, Mr. Lockhart.
Sorry.<eos> Chief, this is my daughter Maddie.<eos> - This is Chief Irving.<eos> - Nice to meet you.<eos> I've heard a lot about you.
I could've stopped it, if only I'd had the balls to go up there.<eos> But I didn't.<eos> I just drove away.<eos> Next day, it was all over the news.<eos> No mention of you, luckily!
He made me do it.<eos> Who?<eos> The Devil.<eos> Mr. Foley?<eos> How do you mean, the Devil is inside you?
Look, I know it's a lot, but we can deal with the press stuff later.<eos> Right now, I just want to be with you.<eos> Here.<eos> Like this.<eos> - I heard the whole about you. - Mr. Parker.
I'm glad you like it... but I'm afraid I know nothing about your husband or any forged painting.<eos> Do you know who I am?<eos> I'm Georgina Clios... of the Clios Foundation.<eos> I've heard of you, yes.<eos> But I haven't heard of you.
Sorry, uh...<eos> Excuse me one moment.<eos> Sherlock Holmes.<eos> Mr. Holmes, this is Eli Kotite.<eos> Mr. Kotite, would you believe I was just talking about you?
Save your bloody breath, you heartless bitch, and turn around.<eos> They took Helena.<eos> To the island, presumably.<eos> I wouldn't be so certain.<eos> Neolution will survive Rachel's betrayal, but the stress has taken its toll on you, so you should be cautious with this.
- Let's go! - Hey!<eos> Good work.<eos> What happened?<eos> It was a close call, but we're safe.<eos> Chairman Park put in a good word for you.
So... from Caliban's heart, I say this. In all my life, well, till I met you... I never had a friend.<eos> If we nail down Ben's death today... then, hell, we're within hollering distance of the end.<eos> Max. Let me introduce you. This is Mrs. Bernstein.<eos> How do you do?<eos> Mr. Perkins. Tom has told me so much about you.
Our faith.<eos> It's our faith now, isn't it, Mr. Perkins?<eos> Tom couldn't have done it without you. That's not true.<eos> You needn't play at humble pie with me. Tom speaks of your contribution with such passion.<eos> He really can't seem to stop talking about you.
Great.<eos> What can I do for you?<eos> I was hoping I could just have a word with you for a second.<eos> I was hoping to, uh, talk to you a little bit about the ritz.<eos> My father says there once was a good man in you.
- Well... - I do wonder, though.<eos> It must be depressing for you to be in all those places right after a terrible thing has happened.<eos> You must have seen so many awful things.<eos> I've seen a few things.<eos> People seem to open up to you.
Michi, this is Sara.<eos> Hello.<eos> Thanks for this.<eos> Michi does these suicide watch hikes off the books.<eos> That's very good of you.
Sir, I don't know you.<eos> Yeah, I don't really know you either and, frankly, this is a pain in my ass.<eos> But... like I said, I know your grandparents and your mother was a... she was a good woman.<eos> You knew my mom? - Yeah.<eos> - She never really talked about you.
- Excuse me, mate. - Hey, mate.<eos> Hello. Peter Gruner.<eos> - I'm from the Islington Tribune.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Would you mind if I did a story on you and the cat?
When police officers show up to a domestic violence case often men were just taken away without asking what even happened.<eos> It's just presumed that men are the criminals.<eos> I was assaulted several times, and I never got any help.<eos> I went to the police still bleeding a couple of times, and one police officer said... I'll never forget this, he said,<eos> "if she starts hitting you again," you better get out of there fast, because if she just breaks a fingernail trying to hit you, "we'll arrest you."
You had something to tell me?<eos> No.<eos> This book belongs to Jean-Claude...<eos> We'll be naked.<eos> I'll lie on top of you.
Oh, no.<eos> This isn't over.<eos> When we first met, you told me that I was the Patron Saint of Lost Causes.<eos> You remember that?<eos> I think I may have found another one in you.
Enough.<eos> You've never raised your voice to me.<eos> I'm sorry about that.<eos> I just...<eos> I just want to know more about you.
- Yes, I was there.<eos> - Yes. There are many stories told of that action.<eos> Perhaps. But the stories told by the men who were actually there, under enemy fire, in the thick of it, are a different thing to the stories told by fellows on the staff who get rewards for doing nothing.<eos> And you consider me one of those, do you?<eos> I'm not talking about you.
The usual stereotype.<eos> The picture people have of ... people like you.<eos> Colored.<eos> - You're a celebrity.<eos> - If I can't use your photo - -I have no interest in you.
- Yes, it is.<eos> Suzanne!<eos> I usually do that too.<eos> You are so clever.<eos> The whole staff loves you.
Count Bezukhov?<eos> If I might...<eos> Look here, you don't want to be fighting a duel with this fellow.<eos> Apologise, say you lost your temper.<eos> No-one will think any the worse of you. No.
I hear you broke records in Milan.<eos> I know you have a better story than that, gentlemen.<eos> - Go on, how much was it?<eos> - Thank you. Oh, come on, boys. Give the man a night off.<eos> There's a rumour about you and Elsie Lane.
That was a thought-provoking speech you gave earlier.<eos> Good to know at least one person was listening,<eos> - Mister...?<eos> - Still. William Still.<eos> I've heard of you.
Just a thought.<eos> I know Antoine.<eos> You do?<eos> Sorry, I'm...<eos> It's weird you'd say that, 'cause... he... doesn't talk about you... often...
-You've got to be kidding me.<eos> -Hi.<eos> -Hi.<eos> -Have you met my husband, Erling?<eos> I've heard a lot about you.
Ice-nine.<eos> You're gonna take down the internet.<eos> Been there, done that.<eos> I'm going after bigger game.<eos> So. If you can manage to forget about me, I'll see to it that I forget about you.
Captain, as head of the Kaiser's personal bodyguard, Herr Himmler will surely want your impressions.<eos> May I hope you will give a positive account of our humble and loyal household?<eos> - Of course, Your Highness.<eos> - Thank you, Captain<eos> - I was certain I could rely on you.
Her development was delayed.<eos> Hannah did not utter a word until she was 11 years old.<eos> Please understand...<eos> Mr. Lockhart... she is like a daughter to me.<eos> But we're here to discuss you.
Lights?<eos> Sweetie, you don't know a Fresnel from a gobo.<eos> Well, I think you'll help me every way you can.<eos> And why, pray tell, is that?<eos> Because deep down, there's still a part of you that remembers music can be magical.
No. Salesman or businessman, or something.<eos> He travelled the area.<eos> Type who'd sweep in with a bottle of wine and then not turn up for another month.<eos> - Did you talk to the local lass?<eos> But our victim talked to her neighbour about you.
But no...<eos> Fucking stupid...<eos> Who is it?<eos> What?<eos> Mr. Vega has been hearing a lot of good things about you lately.
- Mr. President.<eos> - Director Coulson.<eos> Thank you for meeting me.<eos> Long overdue.<eos> Rosalind spoke highly of you.
I can't really discuss that. Oh, no.<eos> Of course not.<eos> I just thought you might wanna know in terms of what it might mean regarding public perception.<eos> - Perception of...<eos> - You.
You left Belikov out there to do this.<eos> 45's got his fingerprints on it.<eos> There's a duffel of guns in the ceiling.<eos> Eight counts of homicide's gonna stick a lot better than a trafficking charge.<eos> I vouched for you with very powerful people in Moscow, who would have far preferred to retaliate against you for framing Mr. Belikov.
What is the meaning of this?<eos> How dare you read my private correspondence?<eos> "My dear Sir Leicester,<eos> "it cheers my heart to know that I will see you again soon.<eos> "I have thought of you often.
Yeah, didn't see any after the explosion.<eos> Got lucky, I guess.<eos> My friends are coming to get us.<eos> You have a very important job to do.<eos> You know, they are going to write books about you, the man who saved the leopard who saved the world.
- Right.<eos> "Maya Roberts, 15.<eos> Status... post below-knee amputation of the right leg two years ago after diagnosis of bone cancer, now recurring in the ribs and sternum."<eos> I know why I'm here.<eos> I just wanted to talk about you.
A very strange move for Merring.<eos> Perhaps we convinced him there's no shortage of paranormal help -<eos> - Of con artists or knuckle-dragging idiots who believe them.<eos> - Oh, bloody hell.<eos> Sergeant Gudgett, we were just talking about you.
Let's get one thing straight.<eos> You may have filled Donna's shoes with Harvey, but it's not gonna be that easy filling them with me.<eos> Well, if that's how you want to play it.<eos> I already know that.<eos> I heard all about you.
Well, I can't say as I blame her.<eos> Said it was her only peaceful night of the week.<eos> 30 seconds in, I can see what she means.<eos> But you could turn this around.<eos> Play your tiles right with me, I could put in a word for you.
I hope you know that.<eos> I don't care who your father is, you're done.<eos> No, sir, you are.<eos> I don't know what you think you have on me.<eos> I have a witness who knows everything about you.
The framing itself, indicated to me that you wanted us to see something beneath all the muted colors, deep down in the water.<eos> Terrible despair. Hiding like a Leviathan. Like a sea monster.<eos> - You saw all that?<eos> - Yes, I did.<eos> Perhaps that says more about you than me?
You want to tell me what coincidence means again?<eos> We've met, haven't we?<eos> We have. After that delivery kid went missing, you swung by Meat Cute.<eos> You ever find out what happened to that guy?<eos> Let's focus on you.
Name amount. And I will save you.<eos> - I will not take your money.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - I love you.<eos> - I know you and Grand Duchess.
I'll circle back later.<eos> Captain?<eos> Ah.<eos> Sherlock Holmes, Captain Will Lombardi, Narcotics.<eos> I've heard a lot about you.
Really?<eos> Sounded less chiseled on the phone.<eos> Hello and welcome to Molecule.<eos> - I'm... - Chef Hunter.<eos> Yes, I know everything about you.
I got nothing left.<eos> I couldn't pay this if I wanted to.<eos> If you don't have equity, then sweat will do.<eos> Fuck you.<eos> I vouched for you, Mr. Donovan... with very powerful people in Moscow who would have far preferred to retaliate against you for framing Mr. Belikov.
Give me one day.<eos> 45's got his fingerprints on it.<eos> There's a duffle of guns in the ceiling.<eos> Eight counts of homicide's gonna stick a lot better than a trafficking charge.<eos> I vouched for you with very powerful people in Moscow who would have far preferred to retaliate against you for framing Mr. Belikov.
I mean, I could swim, play in the water, but...<eos> When I was little, my mother, she took my brother Ray and me to this swim class at the Y.<eos> First day there, this kid fell in, hit his head, almost died.<eos> Frickin' lifeguard didn't even jump in to save him.<eos> You understand, Mr. Donovan, I know everything about you.
But even though he was free, they never married.<eos> I think both he and the Queen understood they were not in a position to marry.<eos> Whatever their inclination.<eos> I am honoured that you would dance with me, Ma'am.<eos> I thought I should like to understand what my mother sees in you.
Believe me, I know.<eos> How about we find someplace else to continue this conversation?<eos> So I was wondering one other thing.<eos> Uh, it isn't on the questionnaire.<eos> When I did my internship with Dr. Scully, there were rumors about you and Mrs. Johnson.
We weren't supposed to meet for another 72 hours.<eos> Yeah, well, couldn't wait.<eos> Clearly.<eos> Okay, so what's going on?<eos> Five-O knows about you.
I got this.<eos> After you.<eos> This is Major Cameron.<eos> Mr. President, this is the nuclear football.<eos> It'll be with you whenever you leave the White House.
Give him whatever you want to right here.<eos> Guddu won't go anywhere alone.<eos> Wo...wow, Bagga Sir.<eos> This is amazing.<eos> We'll have to tell him whatever it is, in front of you.
- No, I thought I owed it to Sir Roger to witness his folly.<eos> Well, stay and hear Moffatt speak.<eos> He's trembling like jelly.<eos> Miss Dunstable, may I present Dr Thorne.<eos> But I know all about you.
So you lied under oath?<eos> Your Honor, I think you should stick to the law.<eos> Yes.<eos> And I am sorry for that.<eos> Mr. Assaf, this admission calls into question your integrity, as well as everything positive that was said about you in this courtroom today.
Page me if there's any issues. I'll get the on-call nurse.<eos> Have fun.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Mr. Zeke, it's Tawney.<eos> I'll be with you tonight.
Oh, that's kind of you to say, but I'm doing this for me.<eos> He's the good people.<eos> Well, I'll be back in a little while.<eos> Okay.<eos> I've been thinking about you having no children, Mr. Zeke.
Well, I'm sure, wherever he is, you are foremost in his mind.<eos> Who are you? I'm...<eos> I'm a colleague of his.<eos> My name is also Martin.<eos> He never mentioned you.
Cover-up.<eos> But you can't cover this up.<eos> Agent Smith!<eos> It's so funny seeing you here.<eos> I was just having the loveliest chat with your president about you.
It's all we got.<eos> I know it doesn't seem like it looking around, but hope is coming very soon.<eos> So hang in there a little longer, Bob, okay?<eos> I think I do recognize you...<eos> People on TV saying nasty things about you.
When he was arrested in Russia, he got a message to me.<eos> He was gonna talk unless I helped him.<eos> But I didn't come here to talk about him.<eos> Whom, then?<eos> You.
I'm not blind.<eos> I just had my pupils dilated for an exam.<eos> If it makes you feel any better, I'm seeing stars, too.<eos> What?<eos> I'm talking about you.
Of course, you have to consider the wine pairing.<eos> Miss Kringle? No. Oh, no.<eos> My name's Isabella.<eos> I don't usually talk to people.<eos> There's just, um, something about you. No, no, please.
Yes, Mr. White.<eos> Yes, I will have my article on your desk lickety-split.<eos> Yes, sir, I know that no one says "lickety-split" anymore.<eos> Although, you do still say "Great Caesar's Ghost", which is a bit of a throwback.<eos> Yes, sir, I'm very aware that we're not talking about you.
Of course, Father.<eos> If this is about Dr. Jekyll's membership in the Academy, I've already told him no.<eos> If he thinks sending some... ruffian will change my mind...<eos> That's exactly what he thinks, Doctor.<eos> You see, he told me the story of you and your new lab assistant.
Well, don't bother.<eos> You won't be needing it.<eos> I'm sorry. Excuse me?<eos> I saw a clip of your interview online.<eos> My father fired you, and I won't let you use his funeral as some sort of PR stunt to make you look presidential when he thought you were anything but.
This is one of my cousins.<eos> He said he really wanted to attend the New Era Celebration.<eos> Oh. Is that right?<eos> You must be extremely loyal to the Emperor of Japan.<eos> I've often heard my brother mention you.
Okay, Mr. President. He's coming back on the line now.<eos> - Thank you. - My pleasure, sir.<eos> Governor Royce. You're a hard man to reach.<eos> Well, I told you before. I'm pretty busy.<eos> Well, we're gonna try and lighten the load for you,
Are you the doctor?<eos> No, I work with Agent Blye.<eos> I'm Julia Feldman. Kensi's mom.<eos> Owen Granger.<eos> She's spoken of you.
Richmond didn't want me in his cabinet. He didn't want me at the State of the Union.<eos> That's why I was named Designated Survivor.<eos> Tell me I'm wrong.<eos> Look, six weeks ago, I barely remembered your name.<eos> I didn't know much about you, and, frankly, what I did know didn't impress me.
I think he was plugging his laptop into that to get information on and off of it.<eos> I think I've got some tools in my car.<eos> Thank you for seeing me.<eos> Do I address you by the full "Deputy Chief Prosky", or just "Chief Prosky"?<eos> After all Tommy Gregson has told me about you and your partner, you can call me anything you want.
That's how I always saw it.<eos> Victor.<eos> Special Agent Gibbs. I got a lawyer friend.<eos> I don't know if keeping you home is a battle we can win, but I'd like to help you fight it.<eos> These guys told me a lot about you on the trip here, sir.
There's absolutely nothing I wouldn't do.<eos> And I would never let go.<eos> Thank you for saying that.<eos> You know, he's usually so shy around strangers.<eos> There must be something about you.
So, what's the biopsy?<eos> Is it... Is it terminal?<eos> Well, if we thought that, we wouldn't have come all the way here, right?<eos> We think you could win this thing, Senator.<eos> What we'd like to do is start with some focus groups, get an idea of what people are thinking about you, get...
- Could you set that aside?<eos> - We could.<eos> Marty, in the past, Spotlight's had success in large part ... because they picked their own projects.<eos> Would you consider picking this one?<eos> I don't know if he's writing about you, but... I will let him know you called.
Git!<eos> Stop pestering our guests.<eos> Git.<eos> My name is Dave Turner. Some call me Gentleman Dave.<eos> Yeah... I heard of you.
Hello.<eos> Carol arid.<eos> Richard semco. Glad to meet you.<eos> Likewise.<eos> Therese speaks very highly of you.
All alone.<eos> Alan, this is Sir Thomas Sharpe.<eos> Sir Thomas, Dr. Alan McMichael.<eos> Best man in town if you're feeling poorly.<eos> I've heard so much about you from Mother and my sister.
Well, Greg, I think that it just means that even after somebody dies, you can you can still keep learning about them. You know, their life. It can keep unfolding itself to you just as long just as long as you pay attention to it.<eos> Are you seriously trying to turn this into some stupid sappy lesson?<eos> You're a good kid, Greg. No!<eos> Look, I'm going home.<eos> See, I'm cutting class right in front of you. 'Kay?
Oh! This is my roommate, Cadet Madison.<eos> It's an honour, Admiral<eos> I still can't believe he's your grandfather.<eos> Great-great-grandfather!<eos> I've heard so many things about you Sir!
My scarf.<eos> I lost it.<eos> You must be Farmer Oak.<eos> Gabriel, yes.<eos> My aunt's told me about you.
You can't get rid of people like that.<eos> I have resolved to have no bailiff at all,<eos> Mr. Pennyways, if you'll listen to me for a moment.<eos> Mr. Pennyways, a fire threatened to destroy the barn and you are nowhere to be found.<eos> I have no use for a man like you, Mr. Pennyways.
No, no, no...<eos> Farmer Stone?<eos> It's Miss Everdene.<eos> Farmer Everdene's niece.<eos> He talked about you with such great admiration.
My client needs a good man who can handle situations.<eos> Who's your client?<eos> Mr Owen. Ulick Norman Owen.<eos> Never heard of him.<eos> But he has heard of you.
Our deceased was a strong woman.<eos> Despite this, life was not easy for her at times.<eos> Let this earth be easy on her. Let her recline in the tranquility of eternity.<eos> TWO YEARS LATER<eos> It's said that you're an expert on women. Are you?
- You know, six courses.<eos> Enough. - Yeah.<eos> What's for dessert, a tub of ice cream and four spoons?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Any other psychotic things that we need to know about you?
I'm a reporter for the Lafitte Gazette. As uncomfortable as this is, I got to ask about your relationship with Congressman Pryce.<eos> There must be some mistake.<eos> Honestly, I have no idea who you're talking about.<eos> You've been elected twice in a district that is 60 percent African-American and one that has historically elected black officials since the Seventies.<eos> What do you think that says about you?
There is to be a ball tonight, at Lost-Hope.<eos> And look at me.<eos> How can I meet my Lady like this?<eos> I'm sorry, sir.<eos> Nobody told me you were here.
I did not ask for mist, Merlin. I asked you to move those trees.<eos> I lost my books, my Lord. I apologise.<eos> I've exhausted everything I know.<eos> ~ I've a good mind to put you on a charge.<eos> You've made me rely upon you.
I got this from Moon Il-seok, former accountant at Mirae Motors.<eos> It shows Mirae made a slush fund with 3 billion from Hangyul Bank and gave 30 million to Congressman Jang for his election campaign.<eos> Is it true that sex favors were offered at Oh's villa?<eos> Who were the women forced into it?<eos> You claimed Oh and Jang retaliated against you.
Let's bring him in.<eos> And then?<eos> If there's something to settle, let's settle it before it's too late.<eos> Seok Myung-kwan Former President of Hangyul Bank Seok Myung-kwan Former President of Hangyul Bank I'm deeply sorry for causing so much anxiety to the nation.<eos> Any comments on the charges against you?
Keeps me busy.<eos> You know, I think I... I became a policeman because of you.<eos> - You're blowing smoke.<eos> - No, no, no, my...<eos> You know, my dad talked about you a lot.
Right, so it's another teenage girl buried with her camera, is it?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Just sometimes... Uh...<eos> We think you should prepare yourself for bad news, sir.<eos> Now, is there someone who can sit with you while we ask you some questions?
You set Bill onto an innocent man.<eos> What do you think to that?<eos> You had something to hide, so you set Bill onto Manttan to protect yourself.<eos> - Do what?<eos> - Did Carrie know something about you?
I'm Governor...<eos> Men! At ease.<eos> I'm Governor Thomas Hutchinson.<eos> I've heard much about you.<eos> And I you.
You're all out of toilet paper, hon.<eos> Now, what if I report to the authorities... that my securities have been breached... and my identity has been stolen?<eos> As I've just learned, it doesn't matter if this bag is real or fake.<eos> Because of where I come from, everybody's going to assume it's fake.<eos> So, since you and I come from the same place, what is the DEA going to assume about you?
Where's Molly?<eos> She's here at home. We all are.<eos> Your missus is sleepin', and the girl right there with her.<eos> [ Sighs ] She's stubborn, all right, your daughter.<eos> Your wife says she gets that from you.
Look how much you've helped Connie.<eos> And all the other girls that have worked for you.<eos> You've been the making of us. Come on.<eos> I'll walk with you.<eos> Miss Mardle told me about you... .. and Ernest.
He was satisfied with the judge's decision on the housing desegregation case.<eos> I was not.<eos> Vote Wasicsko. All right?<eos> It's time for a new future.<eos> - Oh, I've heard about you.
I await you with open arms!<eos> How are you?<eos> Thanks for coming.<eos> I'd rather not be here... I don't have good news.<eos> I just received a tip-off about you from the DA's office.
Sell your bullshit somewhere else, Waits. Aww.<eos> That's not polite.<eos> I'm sorry you're skeptical, Detective.<eos> I'm telling the truth.<eos> You know, I read about you, Detective.
I'm telling the truth.<eos> You know, I read about you, Detective.<eos> Up from such sad beginnings, from that place where they put you after... Your mother was taken.<eos> And now look at you, a man on a mission.<eos> Isn't that what they say about you?
Oh, sorry.<eos> Am I interrupting?<eos> - And you are?<eos> - Lillian Moss, this is Detective Murdoch.<eos> I've heard a great deal about you.
There won't be any fingermark samples on offer, either.<eos> Mr. McAllister, your employee claims innocence.<eos> Allow him to prove it.<eos> He doesn't have to prove anything.<eos> The onus is entirely on you, Detective.
I just did what I needed to do, sir.<eos> Yeah, there was a lot of people there.<eos> You were the only one who acted.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> But we're here to talk about you.
Pieces of his flesh had been bitten off.<eos> Can you imagine this?<eos> I am sorry.<eos> You have no idea how sorry I am.<eos> Since that day, I have thought of you often.
He asked for the keys to the SUV and my gun.<eos> And you let him leave?<eos> Alone?<eos> He ordered me to stay.<eos> He wanted as many men on you as possible.
- Hmm. Now we know where you're from and your preference in liquor.<eos> You think maybe you could tell me who the hell you are?<eos> Ava...<eos> You mind if I call you Ava?<eos> If I do mind, I'll just add it to the list of things I'm holding against you.
Would you care to join me, Miss Borden?<eos> Lizzie.<eos> - Here you are. - Mm.<eos> So who are you?<eos> You don't have enough grease on you to be a book writer or a reporter.
Because if I don't not do that, isn't that the same as...<eos> - Let's move on.<eos> - Okay. Is it not true that Wired...<eos> I'll rephrase.<eos> Did Wired Magazine run a cover story on you?
Why do you think that?<eos> Mr. Mahler and I are long-time colleagues.<eos> We have a few skeletons in the closet.<eos> You can speak quite openly here.<eos> According to rumor, the Gestapo didn't just hound you because you were a socialist with Jewish origins.
-It's about 9:30.<eos> In the morning?<eos> Yes, in the morning.<eos> I've been here for.. four days.<eos> We just heard about you yesterday.
He discharged himself, just like you, my friend did, took the train up to London, found digs in Brixton, and never looked back.<eos> An offer of work. You see, it meant that someone... was thinking of him.<eos> It was ever such a comfort.<eos> And here's something to cheer you up... a full house tonight.<eos> People thinking of you, wanting to see you act.
Thank you, Mr. Finch.<eos> Just got to say, it was a...<eos> It was just a damn shame what happened to your daddy.<eos> He was a good man, your father.<eos> He always spoke well of you, too.
Everything has a price, Abbas.<eos> You just need to know who..and how?<eos> Inspector Yohaan, your Big B look and attitude won't work here.<eos> Do you expect me to trot around like Singham?<eos> There are serious charges of corruption against you.
You must be here for TJ.<eos> I'm Lisa Kelly, the administrator.<eos> Uh, which one of you is Jamie? That's me.<eos> Ah.<eos> He talks about you.
Mr. Santos, what happened to your son, no one could have seen coming.<eos> You can't blame yourself.<eos> What you knew about him was what mattered the most, his character.<eos> His English teacher gave this to me.<eos> It's an essay about you.
- She's drinking right there at the end of the bar.<eos> There he is.<eos> My big, strong copper.<eos> Miss...<eos> Mack. - I wasn't talking about you.
Alfred Pennyworth.<eos> Young Master Bruce Wayne's guardian.<eos> Ah, yes.<eos> It's a funny old game though, ain't it? Coincidence, I mean, me bumping into you like this.<eos> I mean... I was just thinking about you.
You did the right thing.<eos> I guess I did.<eos> I'm kind of amazed at myself.<eos> You, doing the right thing, it's what you do every day.<eos> That's why people speak so highly of you.
- Yes.<eos> It's okay.<eos> He's a friend of my son.<eos> Do you remember the text messages that were exchanged with MSC's Reporter Sung Cha Ok?<eos> I've heard a lot about you from Bum Jo.
If he thought there was any chance of that, then he wouldn't have stayed in that apartment.<eos> We'll take care of the rest of the booking details later.<eos> - Anything on the van?<eos> - No, not yet.<eos> You know, when I first got here, I couldn't figure out what Beckett saw in you.
- Since when do terrorists - hire ex-Gurkhas to do their dirty work?<eos> - All this effort for a woman you never trusted in the first place.<eos> I have to make a stop before we go to the hospital.<eos> It was a... traumatic wound, but Sam is expected to make a full recovery.<eos> I can't say the same about you and your relations with the CIA.
He's going places.<eos> - What's our E.T.A., Frank?<eos> - Just a few more minutes, sir.<eos> Detective Kevin Ryan, Congressman Alex Lopez.<eos> Frank speaks very highly of you.
No.<eos> I owe you an apology, and a thank you.<eos> No, you don't owe me anything.<eos> You're the only person who believed that I was innocent, and I still don't know why.<eos> You know what Lilly hated about you?
I have over the years been approached by all the various interview shows.<eos> And I'm not interested in doing a "True Crime" kind of stuff.<eos> Right.<eos> You know more about Robert Durst than any of those people do.<eos> I guess the question is, you know, has anybody really done a piece on you where they didn't walk into it with a very strong assumption?
Louis.<eos> I Was with _him_.<eos> And it is well.<eos> I know ... What happened to her.<eos> He Told me about you.
No, Sergeant Jeffords can make up his mind without the influence of Foxy Brown or cold yogurt.<eos> He is a grown man.<eos> Oh, I see what's going on here<eos> You're upset that Terry would even consider leaving the Nine-Nine.<eos> I'd expect this pettiness from a spineless amoeba like Charles, but not you, Sir.
I knew it was blood money.<eos> So I told them no. I told them to send it back.<eos> I mean, I'm not gonna get paid off.<eos> We killed U.S. soldiers.<eos> Look, I read about you on the Internet, Mr. Decker.
I will take it seriously.<eos> There is no doubt about it.<eos> I tell you to assist you, to save you from embarrassment.<eos> Thank you, Chief Inspector.<eos> The responsibility for the girl and all her actions lies with you.
We ain't here for coffee, Doc.<eos> My friend and I are in the pharmaceutical business and...<eos> Yeah, like you, right?<eos> Except we don't prescribe them.<eos> Reggie told us about you.
I got in touch with Kim Jin-kyu.<eos> No, I didn't find him.<eos> He actually called me, I don't know how he found out.<eos> Asked why I wanted him.<eos> I told him about you, and he knows you well.
2013, sir.<eos> Class of 2013...<eos> How's Prof. Lee?<eos> He's still alive and kicking.<eos> He actually told me a lot about you.
I promise.<eos> Dad, you have to give him a chance.<eos> Oh, Mr. S. I got you something while I was in space.<eos> You can open it now or after you kill me.<eos> - It reminded me of you.
We meet again.<eos> Okay. Your wife has been suffering from an increasingly frequent number of semi-psychotic episodes.<eos> Mr. Smith, in layman's terms, you seem to be Francine's trigger.<eos> Ahh. I'm not her trigger.<eos> Thoughts of you, even mentions of your name send her into a literal state of hysteria.
Pulse is steady.<eos> Copy that, squad 37.<eos> I'm sure she'll be glad that your car had air bags.<eos> Oh. She's gonna chew me out, always says I drive too fast.<eos> Sounds like she cares about you a lot.
Be a man.<eos> Mr. Goddard.<eos> Mrs. Bligh.<eos> - Ah, Mr. Goddard.<eos> I heard so much about you.
- Happy Thanksgiving!<eos> - Happy Thanksgiving!<eos> - Here we are.<eos> - Oh, God.<eos> You know we wouldn't forget about you, sir.
- His name was Ronnie.<eos> - Him either. You told me you have proof of your identity?<eos> This almost hit me when I went through the portal.<eos> Your stabilized breach downstairs connects directly to the S.T.A.R. Labs on my Earth.<eos> Technically, this could be mine, but I want to run some tests on you.
Mr. Berenson, you assured me Faisal Marwan would be treated fairly and with respect.<eos> Instead, he was just arrested, forced into a car like a common criminal.<eos> Now even his lawyer can't get access to him.<eos> I don't have to tell you, we're facing a major threat.<eos> I know what we are facing. I'm talking about you and me, what your word is worth.
I'm fine, thank you.<eos> Did you misplace my number?<eos> Some things are better to discuss in person.<eos> Like violating campaign finance laws, bribing elected officials, that sort of thing.<eos> Sherlock didn't say much about you over the years, but he said enough.
The evidence is against you.<eos> How can you run from here?<eos> How are you connected to Kaaya Murder case?<eos> Please tell us.<eos> Mr. Diwan, what secrets did Kaaya know about you?
Well, I hope you've kept the receipt because I don't need your help mitigating shit.<eos> Furthermore, you don't do me favors.<eos> I do you favors.<eos> You're only in line to be Prime Minister because you happened to be standing next to the guy who died.<eos> I could say the same about you, my King.
No! No!<eos> No, no, no!<eos> My God.<eos> If I had any new information about your wife, don't you think I would've told you by now?<eos> You know, I'm not sure what to think about you, Johnson.
Tanzania.<eos> Mr. Tanzania, you speak English?<eos> I let the money do the talking.<eos> It's funny, Mr. Tanzania, I have never heard of you.<eos> And I never heard of you.
Franco...<eos> He's out cold. We're going to need an EMT here.<eos> You still think I'm your bad guy?<eos> You were on the runway, about to take off in the Skystormer.<eos> That doesn't exactly bode well for you.
He left me that, too.<eos> Everything all right, Detective?<eos> Can I be honest with you?<eos> Weird, but okay.<eos> I've been thinking about you and what you do.
How can you be so sure?<eos> Because in order to kill the bill, she has to stand up there for 16 hours. That's 16 hours where she's not allowed to lean on anything for support, 16 hours where she won't be able to eat or pee.<eos> Yes, people have done it before, but those people trained for it.<eos> They put on diapers, wear comfortable shoes...<eos> What do you think? There's no talking about Mellie without talking about you.
I'm Olivia Brody,<eos> I'm Program Manager for Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.<eos> Some call it DARPA, as that is a little easier to say.<eos> And I oversee NCT Pinzon's work.<eos> Agent Pride, I have heard a lot about you.
Age, gender, appearance.<eos> That girl tonight was going to be his sacrifice to the goddess Idun.<eos> And now he needs her replacement. Down to the wire.<eos> There's extraordinary interest amongst The Gamblers.<eos> The odds have decisively turned against you. You must be delighted.
Would you like to hold him?<eos> Oh, no, I'm a little out of practice.<eos> No, please.<eos> What's his name?<eos> We'd like to name him after you.
What's wrong with that?<eos> I've been drinking for over 30 years with no ill effect.<eos> Drinking may work for you, - but it doesn't agree with everyone.<eos> - My father, for example.<eos> He looks up to you, Inspector.
- You better not be drinking or using drugs.<eos> - Him? Forget it.<eos> He's an angel.<eos> Sounds like one too.<eos> Who does he get that from, you or your wife?
I'll make sure you get them as soon as possible, because... the defense already took away copies.<eos> This is Quirijn Herzberg.<eos> Your new lawyer.<eos> He'll help us with the appeal.<eos> - Theo told me about you.
But in order for us to do that, we need content.<eos> Hey, everybody!<eos> Annie! - Hi. - Hank Rosenbaum.<eos> Such a pleasure.<eos> Thank you so much. I've heard so much about you.
Ah, there they are.<eos> Mr. Goto.<eos> Ah... We finally meet.<eos> - Ha-ha-ha. - Likewise, sir.<eos> Your son speaks very highly of you.
I know Uco has that fire.<eos> I had to lose a lot in my life before I could truly see that that was important.<eos> I don't want the same to happen to my boy.<eos> He won't, sir.<eos> The time I've known him, he speaks nothing but highly of you.
Maybe I want to take a dirty shot.<eos> Kind of like the dirty shot you took on my daughter.<eos> I didn't take a dirty shot on your daughter, okay?<eos> We talked a lot, and we care about each other.<eos> All the good qualities you have, I can feel inside of Maya.
It's best if you two stay out of the fray and leave it to the big boys.<eos> You stay, you die.<eos> Okay? - Let's go.<eos> - Sir, I am here now.<eos> I want you to consider me by your side as a skilled negotiator and co-commander.
Well, you must call me Rose!<eos> And I probably shouldn't call you a child, now you're all grown-up.<eos> I don't mind.<eos> And you must be the famous Dr. Quirke.<eos> I've heard a great deal about you.
The health of India now lies in Mr. Gajra's hands.<eos> Ven/ good.<eos> - It's nothing good.<eos> I'll take those 500 billion and disappear.<eos> No one can even think about you like that.
You see, gossip is what holds civilization together.<eos> It reinforces shame.<eos> And without shame, well, the world is a very dangerous place.<eos> I'm sorry. I don't understand.<eos> Do you know what the gossip is in London about you?
Can I talk to you about Soichi?<eos> Yeah.<eos> He's been acting strangely these last few days.<eos> Yes.<eos> He mentioned you, so I thought I should call.
He's sacrificed a lot for us<eos> Hey, Chulee I'm really sorry<eos> He seems like a nice guy<eos> You can use normal language, Chow<eos> Mr Chavoret, I've heard so much about you
Truth to tell, my eyes aren't so good these days so when I do look in the looking-glass I be glad I cannot see so well.<eos> When I peruse myself in the looking-glass, I see a gargoyle.<eos> Now, you be fishing for compliments, and my old ma used to say, them what fish for compliments don't get none.<eos> Besides, 'tis what's within a person that do matter.<eos> I do not know you, Mr Mallard, and I'm sure there be things about you that are beyond my understanding, but I believe you to be... a man of great... spirit and fine feeling.
-That's it.<eos> Well Dr. Quirke, on paper it seems you've done everything that was asked of you.<eos> You want to go home, fine.<eos> But my concern and I'm being frank with you, is that we'll be seeing you back in here before long.<eos> You've an interesting job, a good mind, no family hanging out of you no-one telling you to do anything you don't want to do and yet you're hell bent on killing yourself, with liquor.
You might have to do it yourself, if they ever let you out from behind that desk.<eos> Colonel William Donovan, US Intelligence coordinator.<eos> Commander Ian Fleming, Royal Navy.<eos> I've heard a lot about you.<eos> I've heard a lot about you too.
- I guessed so.<eos> - Really?<eos> How?<eos> You come often.<eos> I've heard about you.
Bad girl.<eos> Bad, bad girl.<eos> Look at me... and tell me you're not going to tell him.<eos> I'm buying a cottage.<eos> I've made a lot of money out of you, mister.
I've got it.<eos> Let's talk about that tomorrow.<eos> Tomorrow.<eos> We have some business to discuss.<eos> Ivan has told me a lot about you.
Harry, this is a woman you simply HAVE to meet.<eos> My dear friend Delphine Day.<eos> We met on the boat coming over.<eos> Now we're inseparable!<eos> I've heard so much about you, I feel as if I already know you!
Hello.<eos> I almost didn't come.<eos> Yeah, I was worried.<eos> What changed your mind?<eos> I did some research on you.
This kid knew things about that day at the river.<eos> Told me about a bald man who was there with Barbara.<eos> I don't know how he could have known all that.<eos> I don't know what to think about any of this.<eos> But I saw you the moment you saw him.
--Pleasure's all mine.<eos> Pierre Michel, the new judge for organized crime.<eos> John Cusack, from DEA.<eos> He represents the United States.<eos> I heard about you.
Sure is.<eos> Your inner voice can provide a method of taking control of your behavior, accepting responsibility for what you've done.<eos> Giving your thoughts words encourages clarity.<eos> Oh, I have clarity.<eos> About you.
Tell me!<eos> I was seduced.<eos> It was your daughter!<eos> Sensei, you like young girls, right?<eos> I understand you. I understand you completely.
What is going on?<eos> Say! Where is Kanako?<eos> Kanako is... your daughter.<eos> I understand you.<eos> I understand you completely.
Thank you.<eos> My pleasure.<eos> Mr Selfridge.<eos> Miles Edgerton.<eos> I've heard a lot about you.
My pleasure.<eos> Mr Selfridge.<eos> Miles Edgerton.<eos> I've heard a lot about you.<eos> And I you, Lord Edgerton.
I need you to do something for me.<eos> Find this woman.<eos> Frank Edwards' paper hasn't printed my letter.<eos> Perhaps it will be in the evening edition. It had better be.<eos> The Times has written about you positively.
Oh, this is my friend Serge Lombart.<eos> He's with the French ministry of culture.<eos> Ah.<eos> Serge, Daniel Pierce.<eos> Miranda's told me so much about you.
Ah.<eos> Serge, Daniel Pierce.<eos> Miranda's told me so much about you.<eos> Oh.<eos> She hasn't mentioned you.
You're a funny fellow, Mr. Nordling.<eos> Is there anything you don't know?<eos> About what, General?<eos> About me.<eos> You?
They'll finish in 20 minutes.<eos> Can I borrow a towel?<eos> I can drive you home.<eos> It only takes three minutes.<eos> All the girls in school are in love with you, do you understand.
Ah. You look exactly the same, which frankly, annoys me.<eos> - You look great. - Oh, hi.<eos> I'm, uh, Eric Ward.<eos> J. Martin Bellamy, Immigration and Customs.<eos> Yes, Maggie's told me all about you.
Oh, I bet you're a devil at the bridge table.<eos> - It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance.<eos> - The pleasure's mine.<eos> [But now I know your name,] [of course I am aware of you by reputation] [and I see why Chilton] [both reveres you and resents you.]<eos> Esteem in psychiatric circles still eludes him, yet it clings to you like soap to a baby's eyes.
Remember that feeling.<eos> - I tend to walk out of this building in a very similar state.<eos> You must be a patient of Dr. Lecter's. - I'm sorry?<eos> - You look familiar.<eos> I either know you or I know of you.
Red tape had XD-8 in near dissolution, but, it was willed to completion by Valor's chief engineer...<eos> Jessica Peyton.<eos> I was on her protection detail in Saudi Arabia. She had total control of everything on this project, but, not her ten-year-old daughter.<eos> Riley.<eos> Whom, as I recall, made quite the impression on you, yes? She was like this little... pint-sized ball of energy and fun.
I'm Thomas Schaeffer.<eos> I work with Catherine sometimes.<eos> Behavioral psychologist?<eos> That's right.<eos> I've heard a lot about you, too.
I own this place.<eos> Welcome, welcome.<eos> Agent Kim Fischer.<eos> Patrick Jane.<eos> Jason told me about you.
His shoulders.<eos> Hey, now, uh -- Hey, now, I'm just saying, if you need some help, I could help you.<eos> I mean, murder is my business.<eos> Sure.<eos> I've heard good things about you.
I'm telling you about Anna.<eos> And here's something about her, ok?<eos> She's a troubled little girl and we're working our butts off to get her life all cleaned up.<eos> You know that? Right?<eos> She told me some things about you.
Hi. I'm sorry.<eos> Do I know you? I'm Stan Glassman.<eos> I'm a producer.<eos> [ Gasps ] Oh, my God. I do know you. [ Chuckles ]<eos> I mean, I know of you.
- That means arrested.<eos> Will you shut up? Just shut up, Shawn.<eos> Mucking up our whole sting.<eos> We thought we were done for.<eos> Until we heard of you.
He's lying through his teeth.<eos> LINDA: What we're doing is working.<eos> We keep the whisper campaign alive.<eos> We spin him as power-hungry, as duplicitous.<eos> Focus attention on him. Not you.
A foreigner, I hear?<eos> Was he not, Alma dear?<eos> Don't you have a wedding to get ready for?<eos> Dr Duncan!<eos> I could say the same for you.
Where are you?<eos> Sir, it's good to hear your voice.<eos> Of course it's you, Kane.<eos> You're too stubborn to die.<eos> I could say the same for you.
Well, you certainly come by that honestly.<eos> I know about your parents.<eos> About their activities during the '60s.<eos> But you, you... you became a cop.<eos> That says a lot about you, about them.
You're the one that pulled the stunt on the motorcycle?<eos> Yes.<eos> Reckless.<eos> This is Dr. Shaf Keshavjee.<eos> Dr. Keshavjee, I've heard so much about you.
And why is that?<eos> Am I losing my touch?<eos> Is my judgment impaired?<eos> Am I mad?<eos> The sight of Jagger has awakened something inside of you.
Well, Joe's not exactly the girlfriend type.<eos> So, what did he do to make you so mad at him?<eos> What did he do to make you so mad at him?<eos> Is that what he told you?<eos> No, he never talks about you.
Nice move bringing me down, by the way.<eos> You have to teach me that one.<eos> Whatthehellyou think you're doing, Booth?<eos> Sanderson called the director, saying you harassed him.<eos> I'm doing my job, which is more than I can say for you.
How would you like to change the world?<eos> How'd you get that?<eos> We're Sonmanto.<eos> We have friends everywhere.<eos> And between this little box and the wires left in you, Mr. Ryan, you can throw those away for good.
- I need a blood sample.<eos> Is it necessary?<eos> Your sperm isn't working.<eos> But you're still the last man to impregnate a woman.<eos> And we know you fertilized one of the one hundred eggs, so, secret has to be inside of you somewhere.
Now, think of what that will mean for you and your people at the Rezidentura -- all those deportations.<eos> Moscow will not be pleased when they have to rebuild their US operation from scratch.<eos> As we like to say in America, "Heads will roll" -- your head being at the top of the list.<eos> So... you see, my problem is now your problem.<eos> I heard so much about you, Mr. Gaad.
My husband is dead, but I would know his account.<eos> Will you permit me to speak with Ezra Marvell?<eos> Mrs. Wakefield.<eos> Is it true?<eos> Mr. Marvell? What they say of you, that you're...
What is it you want to know?<eos> Which of you and your husband performed the act?<eos> I am inclined to tell you.<eos> You will have my gratitude.<eos> As inducement, however, I would hear something from you, Inspector.
Permission to go to the privy Mr H?<eos> I'll only be a pissing while.<eos> That bladder must be the size of a walnut.<eos> The baby's pressing down on me waterworks.<eos> That's how I know it takes after you.
Sorry.<eos> Miss Price.<eos> Always a pleasure.<eos> You say the nicest things.<eos> I love that about you.
You better get going.<eos> Daniels will be here soon.<eos> Okay, you'll be fine.<eos> Why don't you tell her the truth ... that you're still alive?<eos> Sir, it's just the way she talks about you sounds like you two had something nice.
- Right.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I'm sorry we've never had a chance to meet face-to-face.<eos> Oh, me too.<eos> Danny's always spoken very highly of you.
I-I, uh...<eos> I met her at your going-away shindig.<eos> Dr. Pierce, I'd like you to meet Special Agent Bishop.<eos> She's gonna be your new liaison now that Moretti's moving on to greener pastures.<eos> I've heard a lot about you, Dr. Pierce.
It was the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen.<eos> But it wasn't a sunset at all.<eos> The sky was on fire.<eos> Is that why you joined the military?<eos> A high probability, given what I've learned about you and your interest in National Security.
Dad.<eos> Well, I would have to say that I like the fact that she knows exactly who she is.<eos> That she doesn't take crap from anybody, and I mean anybody.<eos> She's a... she's just a... she's a tough cookie, my little cookie.<eos> Probably like you, sir.
He could be gone for hours.<eos> I wouldn't wait if I were you.<eos> Are you Magoo?<eos> That's a nickname. Why?<eos> - Right, I heard about you.
I definitely wouldn't have called you an idiot.<eos> Apology accepted.<eos> You must be Molly.<eos> Mr. Yasumoto.<eos> I've heard so much about you.
Yes, what about it?<eos> Well, why wasn't I considered? [Sighs]<eos> I think Anita just wanted it a little bit more.<eos> You are the reason I came to work here, sir.<eos> But I don't seem to be impressing you.
You saved them.<eos> Hildegard saved them.<eos> - You haven't even noticed, have you?<eos> - Noticed what?<eos> While you've been off gallivanting... ..she's fallen in love with you.
- Speaking.<eos> Dr. Morgan, I have to say, talking to you is probably the most exciting thing that's ever happened in my life.<eos> Well, that's nice. For most people, it's not even the high point of their day.<eos> I'm sure.<eos> If they knew more about you, their opinion would change.
Fear and anger.<eos> Since you don't look like a guy who's afraid of anything, you need to get angry.<eos> You need to get so angry that your brain lets loose every bit of adrenaline it has left.<eos> I'm too tired to be angry.<eos> I don't know much about you or what you've been through. But Lydia told me some of it.
Uh, it was good.<eos> John Tucker. I'm with the embassy.<eos> Nice to finally meet you.<eos> Finally?<eos> Your father talks about you all the time.
And I'm sure you will say...<eos> "I love that. I want more of that.<eos> I want more of the people... of the family that did that."<eos> - You sound very confident.<eos> - Uh-huh. Would you be interested in hearing what the sheikh had to say about you?
Sad to leave us, I bet.<eos> Yeah. I think I'm really gonna miss the place.<eos> It's funny that.<eos> Anyone in particular?<eos> Well I'm really gonna miss having you around to make me feel safe.
- Mr. Masterson?<eos> - Yes? Matthew Booth from the Toronto Gazette.<eos> I just read in the New York Telegraph that you and the constabulary are hot on the trail of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.<eos> - That's right.<eos> - I'd like to do a story on you.
Just as the most striking woman I have seen in all of Toronto enters the station, I'm leaving.<eos> - Ah, you must be Mr. Masterson.<eos> - Mm, you recognize me - from the newspapers?<eos> - No...<eos> - My husband-to-be spoke of you.
I got hope... that this speech is gonna end soon.<eos> You keep living in the past, you're gonna wind up alone.<eos> Can't run away from your past either.<eos> Mr. Egret, it's an honor.<eos> I've read a lot about you, sir.
Time?<eos> To do what?<eos> Get ahead of the story.<eos> One of your own is dead.<eos> That reflects badly on you.
Mrs Middleton.<eos> Yes.<eos> Can the workers in your factory rely on you, Mr Allingham?<eos> Could you repeat the question a little louder, so everyone hears it?<eos> I was wondering whether the workers in your factory can rely on you.
Reverend Turner? Yes?<eos> My name's Whicher.<eos> I'm the man that found Matthew.<eos> Mr Whicher.<eos> Sergeant Evans spoke of you.
And what did I do?<eos> All I did was my job.<eos> Really?<eos> Go home, Mr Suri.<eos> There's nothing for you here.
So what's up?<eos> My guys dug up something on your priest.<eos> It ain't good.<eos> Daisy, turn that up, will you?<eos> ...mentioned you and your charity in her speech.
Jack Porter said that you and Amanda were close.<eos> We were best friends.<eos> I would have done anything for her, despite what you may have heard from other people.<eos> Amanda knew how much you cared about her.<eos> I know for a fact that she never stopped thinking about you.
That's good work.<eos> McGee, give DiNozzo a hand.<eos> Bishop, go check in with Ducky.<eos> You were a Marine.<eos> I can see it all over you.
Yeah. Look, I just wanted to come down here to say that I regret my behavior the other day.<eos> And I've got nothing but respect for you and what everyone does here.<eos> I was upset.<eos> I know you tried to save my son.<eos> Look, Mr. Lullo, you should know that... in the back of that ambulance, your son was talking about you, how important family was.
You're having a very understandable reaction.<eos> If there's anything at all I can do for you... I know it's a bad thing to think of you the way I do.<eos> It's inconvenient.<eos> But who ever loved, loved not at first sight?<eos> I've thought about you since I saw you.
If there's anything at all I can do for you... I know it's a bad thing to think of you the way I do.<eos> It's inconvenient.<eos> But who ever loved, loved not at first sight?<eos> I've thought about you since I saw you.<eos> I'm thinking about you now.
She is far too old to be transferring from another station... but when she heard that you'd been found... well, this is... Murphy Cooper we're talking about.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> We'll have you checked out of here in a couple days.<eos> I'm sure you'll be excited to see what's in store.<eos> I actually... did a paper on you in high school.
- Yeah. Well, he lost his wife.<eos> They were high school sweethearts, and many of the sayings were hers.<eos> She was very upbeat, and so I urged Teddy to write this book as a memento to her memory.<eos> - I'm sort of his inspiration. - Wow.<eos> So he writes about you in the book?
Mr. Carraway, this is my good friend, Mr. Meyer Wolfshiem.<eos> A wonderful pleasure...<eos> - Mr. Carraway.<eos> - My pleasure.<eos> I know all about you.
- Mr. Carraway.<eos> - My pleasure.<eos> I know all about you.<eos> - I see. - Yes!<eos> Mr. Gatsby's... - always talking about you. - Really?
Bow.<eos> Lord Shingen, this is Mr. Logan.<eos> I know who he is.<eos> Your father was a good man.<eos> He would often say the same about you.
See you guys at the party.<eos> - Mr. and Mrs. Berg.<eos> - Hello.<eos> Daniel didn't tell me you were coming.<eos> We kept reading about you in the papers.
And to you, Theresa.<eos> I still be seeing Senator Sloat.<eos> The Senator-- he like to drink. And, you know, the other things.<eos> But mostly, he like to talk... about everything.<eos> Sometimes... about you.
There's been an incident.<eos> No sign of forced entry, nobody else on the building security camera.<eos> The prints on the knife are hers. Where is her lawyer?<eos> She doesn't have one.<eos> Just kept talking about you.
Having my old place tarted up.<eos> Knatton Hall, y'know?<eos> Lazy blighters need a good kick up the backside.<eos> So you're the famous Hastings?<eos> The little Belgian chappie never stops talking about you.
Wasn't it, Mr Poirot?<eos> Oui, mademoiselle.<eos> For the woman who spurned him all those years ago.<eos> For therein lies your tragedy, Monsieur Darrell.<eos> The very gift that could have turned you into the actor supreme... makes you forgettable.
The Labours of Hercules.<eos> That is how you unconsciously conceive your career.<eos> You are the modern incarnation of Hercules.<eos> How resourceful of me.<eos> Hm, Dr Lutz should name a condition after you.
What manner of assistance?<eos> The procedures of psychological recovery are my speciality.<eos> Shush, Binky.<eos> We've established you're a completely useless guard dog.<eos> Erm...thank you, Dr Lutz, I shall bear you in mind.
The wife with whom you are in love... and was in your bedroom when Mademoiselle Cunningham she was being attacked.<eos> Yes.<eos> And her mother, she was with us too.<eos> Oh, naturellement.<eos> Madame Rice was almost constantly with you.
During the course of this night, you will be given several tasks.<eos> If you fail at any... you will never see your wife again.<eos> How do you like the car? Do you like it?<eos> It's armored.<eos> It was designed especially for you.
Amazing.<eos> I was in last year's tournament.<eos> I overheard you say you're going, too.<eos> You're the grown-up who's competing, huh?<eos> I heard about you.
I'm Frau Hoffmeister.<eos> Herr Hoffmeister's wife?<eos> Of course. I'm not his mother.<eos> So we meet at last.<eos> My husband has told me a lot about you.
This is bullshit.<eos> I've been sent here to monitor the situation until the grand jury is in.<eos> You want to keep an eye on things, that's your business.<eos> Just do it at a safe distance.<eos> From what I hear about you, that'd have to be pretty damn far.
Hello, Ilyana.<eos> Katya.<eos> I'm a friend of Dmitry's.<eos> My name's Terrence.<eos> He never mentioned you.
How is she?<eos> I'm glad you're here, love.<eos> This is Mr. Bligh and his daughter, Anna.<eos> How do you do?<eos> I've heard a lot about you.
I hated one of those boys.<eos> He was dirt poor and had no Dad...<eos> You didn't have a Dad, right?<eos> Mr. Watarai.<eos> To tell the truth I know quite a lot about you.
It's time to let it rain and get away from Marquez map.<eos> It's not your decision, but my .<eos> This is my mission.<eos> Colonel, all you have... - is a huge miss and one summons to court-martial.<eos> But do not worry, I will only say good things about you.
The kids should be here soon.<eos> What's up, Gopi?<eos> You're Vishnu Sir, right?<eos> Sir, actually I... I mean, we recognised you at Ganpati's farewell.<eos> We've heard a lot about you.
Do you have room for one more student?<eos> Look at him...<eos> Forget it D...<eos> Rhea, this is Gopi!<eos> Gopi sir, I've heard a lot about you.
Of course he did.<eos> What took him so long?<eos> Does she have any allergies I should know about?<eos> Uh, penicillin and lameness.<eos> I know I've failed to make an excellent impression on you, sir.
Well, this is awkward.<eos> Hello, Mr. Hardy.<eos> I'm Agent Debra Parker.<eos> I'm new the party.<eos> We were just, uh, discussing you.
I'm gonna have to get that out.<eos> When did you become a doctor all of a sudden?<eos> Look, just talk to me, get my mind off it.<eos> Talk to me about your daughter.<eos> Emily? She's completely in love with you.
Why should anyone even pay her regard when your better half has equipped you so well with with loveliness and privilege?<eos> What a lovely sound.<eos> You are unrelentingly cultured.<eos> Come, let's find it.<eos> I do hope you know how well I think of you.
Doesn't she look ravishing, draped over that contraption?<eos> Your husband seems to think so anyway.<eos> I'm sure we all think so, Lady Mae.<eos> Harry, it's a triumph.<eos> Mr Selfridge, you're the talk of the town.
Sorry we're late.<eos> Hi. I'm Jordan.<eos> This is my uncle Donald.<eos> Peter, you look just like your old man. Oh.<eos> My dad has told me a lot about you, sir.
Detective Hickman?<eos> Captain Claude Geroux.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> Pleasure to meet you, sir.<eos> I've heard a lot about you.
It had made her sick...<eos> She's all right, but in her condition, she needs peace.<eos> Women talk.<eos> That is something they do.<eos> She talked about you.
But not permissible.<eos> I love the show.<eos> The show is everything.<eos> But I'm also very interested in you.<eos> There's so little known about you.
At least I can go home.<eos> Yeah. Well, I don't really listen to them.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> You don't listen to me?<eos> I didn't mean you.
Yes, we know.<eos> Well, in the very first episode, did you happen to notice the professor character?<eos> The one with the history with Billy?<eos> The professor that Billy brutally murders?<eos> You think that character's based on you?
Vse chto ugodno.<eos> It is unusual for an American to hold such a position of esteem in our organization.<eos> Mr. Queen.<eos> Anatoli Knyazev.<eos> He speaks very highly of you.
Yes well, we, we try to do our best.<eos> I do find it very hard these days to see how many men are forced to take employment for which they are quite unsuited.<eos> I hope you'll soon get back to whatever it is you're trained for.<eos> Come in, Mr Grigg.<eos> Mrs Hughes has told me all about you.
No, Captain.<eos> My orders are to stop that supply ship.<eos> But this isn't about hardware.<eos> It's about what I believe and what you believe.<eos> And most importantly, it's what I know about you.
Director Lee Seongjun.<eos> Hi, Director Lee.<eos> Nice to finally meet you.<eos> How do you do.<eos> - I heard a lot about you.
I'm a man of considerable precision.<eos> I came to this hospital, to you, because I was told. That you were a neurosurgeon of extreme precision...<eos> One who plays the violin himself,<eos> One who, in fact, has perfect pitch.<eos> I know all about you, and that's why I'm here.
I'll tell you what... why don't we reverse things and play it forward?<eos> So we go from the circulating nurse to the scrub nurse to the resident, and then to who, doctor?<eos> To me.<eos> And does it stop there?<eos> With you?
- Yeah, but we miss you though.<eos> You gotta come back. - Yeah.<eos> I just feel like my carbon footprint was large.<eos> I think you should come back though.<eos> We'll hang out with you, we'll take care of you and we'll just get right back into it and...
I think that's cool.<eos> Did I pass?<eos> I've taken a psych test before.<eos> Ah, Mr. Jane.<eos> We were just discussing you.
That was an amazing segue. I was working on something.<eos> You got there in one move. I hear there's water on Mars now, so I guess they'll be needing boats.<eos> Ten years and I still don't get him.<eos> Just one time, I'd like to visit without that guy staring at me.<eos> Sir, if I could be honest with you, I think that Gary's just nervous around you.
I sent you the e-mail last night.<eos> Not Brian.<eos> It was me.<eos> He wasn't gonna tell you.<eos> I know you guys don't talk that much since he moved out, but... he talks about you a lot.
Like a date?<eos> Yes, a date.<eos> Well, you do know that I'm not this Belle that you're always talking about?<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> I've heard about you, you know.
This coward, he killed two good men without giving them the opportunity to defend themselves.<eos> HPD has lost two family members.<eos> So, yes, sir, we're all adults here, but you can't expect the rank and file not to feel anger about this.<eos> I'm not talking about HPD.<eos> I'm talking about you.
You look like a man who knows his way around a card table. How could you tell?<eos> Vincent Savino.<eos> Patrick Byrne.<eos> I'm just in town from Washington.<eos> I've heard a lot about you.
Mr. Trask, Daniel Grayson.<eos> I understand you'll be taking over for Helen Crowley.<eos> So far as a woman like Helen can be replaced.<eos> I trust she's all right.<eos> She's moved on to greener pastures, though she always spoke quite highly of you, which is why we've elected to keep our business at Grayson Global.
Look, I don't want this animus between Kasper and yourself turning into some kind of private vendetta.<eos> This is Osxfrod, not the Wild West.<eos> - I know my duty, sir.<eos> - See you remember it.<eos> I'm thinking of you, Thursday.
Ah, there you are, Mrs Wainwright.<eos> Professor Fraser, may I introduce you to my former employer?<eos> Mr Foyle.<eos> Detective Chief Superintendant Foyle.<eos> I've heard a lot about you.
It's not easy being a member of this family.<eos> I expect the absolute best.<eos> Honesty, integrity, loyalty in everything we do. Yes, sir.<eos> So where were those traits when you murdered Commander Haber?<eos> I was only ever thinking about you, Admiral.
Anything you can tell me from Barrow's time here, that might help in tracking him, distinguishing characteristics or the like?<eos> He just might be limping on his left side.<eos> Barrow paid the guy he busted out to hack that little piggy off.<eos> Always heard legends seemed smaller when you met 'em.<eos> Was wondering if I could buy you dinner, on the fort worth herald, would like to do a full-on feature on you.
What would dinner on you get me?<eos> Keep you from having to read the same well of baloney that's been written about you before, about being able to hear shots before they're fired, and gunning down 56 outlaws and all. 57, miss Lane.<eos> Have a good one.<eos> Come on, Hamer.<eos> Going to write about you either way.
Fergus always had a way with women.<eos> Poor old Fergus. Had such high hopes for that gallery.<eos> Terrible, isn't it?<eos> We were good friends at university. The truth is, I haven't thought about him in years.<eos> Strange, he's thought about you.
So, why don't you come and visit Newport and I will rustle up...<eos> old rich widows who want titles much more than I do?<eos> This is not me.<eos> London has remade me in a different image.<eos> Maybe London has released you to be seen as you really are.
I want you to meet someone.<eos> - This isn't the boyfriend, is it?<eos> - It sure is.<eos> Oh, it's an absolute pleasure.<eos> Miss Carmen talks about you all the time.
- I'm sorry. - No.<eos> And she cried for hours.<eos> I understand why Ellen would be grateful to you for killing the impostor.<eos> But she felt more than that, didn't she?<eos> How did you make her love you, Gerry?
Okay, I'll play along here.<eos> I am a black female lieutenant For the westchester county police department.<eos> Do you see this gun?<eos> I'm authorized to use it.<eos> On you.
You're a free man.<eos> What's next, professor?<eos> I suppose I'll return to the life I led before I fell for a woman who doesn't exist.<eos> The woman you fell for does exist.<eos> Beth Ryan really cares about you.
Gotta say, Mike.<eos> Don't always enjoy these little tropical vacations, but they're never dull.<eos> It is a pleasure to finally meet you, Mr. Axe.<eos> I've heard good things. Yeah.<eos> Right back at you.
Maybe I can assist you.<eos> My name is Lieutenant Provenza.<eos> - Right.<eos> Lieutenant Provenza. - Ah.<eos> Rusty talked about you.
If Mr. Bohannon finds out that<eos> - That a man who is encumbered by what's right and what's wrong will never achieve anything.<eos> Are you listening to me?<eos> I am not encumbered by what encumbers most men because I am not most men.<eos> I thought I saw the same potential in you.
Please, just tell me.<eos> We are doing all that we can to make sure she is safe.<eos> Thank you for the tea, Doctor.<eos> Um... you all right? Yes.<eos> It's just, uh... she mentioned you at the funeral.
And me. You've been watching me, too, haven't you, Dyfan?<eos> Never a smile on those ruby red lips.<eos> It was you who phoned Iwan, wasn't it?<eos> Sent him up to the house.<eos> I expected better from you.
No inquest would be complete without a question from you.<eos> What is it?<eos> We're to understand Sir, that, er, unlike his wife, Mr Wickham would never have been admitted to Pemberley, ball or no ball.<eos> What relevance are social invitations to the matter at hand?<eos> This could turn to you, sir.
T.J. Karsten.<eos> Have a good day, buddy.<eos> Thatcher Karsten.<eos> Please don't tell me we have kids in the same class.<eos> I've heard a lot about you.
Ovechkin.<eos> He does everything well ...<eos> But I do not love him.<eos> And I have realized such a thing, that ...<eos> It would be easy for me to fall in love with you ... you still a teacher.
But... unfortunately, my circumstances-- it's probably not gonna happen.<eos> You mean because of the F.B.I.?<eos> Mm. You have been doing your homework.<eos> They don't know I'm here.<eos> Which means they don't know you're here.
She wanted to see if they were good for lunch.<eos> Where do they sell food on the train?<eos> I know you think that I walked into police academy because I got pushed over for Squad.<eos> It's not the reason why.<eos> I wanted out because I found out about you and my mom.
Don't be so sure.<eos> I told you, I don't know where Chalky is.<eos> You've got problems with him, take it up with him.<eos> Now get the fuck out of my club.<eos> When I run him through, watch the light go out, I hope he knows what a friend he had in you.
I feel, um...<eos> What'd you give her?<eos> You got stood up.<eos> No, something must have happened. Yeah, what clearly happened is your cover got blown.<eos> I wonder what your daughter will think of you now.
And I know one piece of luggage you won't be taking with you.<eos> You know what's interesting about this?<eos> I've got witnesses who recall you on board the platform the morning of the explosion carrying that briefcase.<eos> But no one seems to remember you leaving with it.<eos> Not even Perry Davidson, who spent the entire day with you.
Amy, this is television legend Arthur Jeffries.<eos> His science show inspired millions of children.<eos> Hold-Hold-Hold on. You...<eos> You have a girlfriend?<eos> Yes, and I've heard so much about you.
Like you.<eos> Tis very flattering of you, Mademoiselle.<eos> It is not flattery. On m'a offense.<eos> It is the truth.<eos> The loveliest thing about you is that you have no idea of how beautiful you are.
- I have to stop this.<eos> - Don't you dare. You're promoting stereotypes, James.<eos> You're advancing this idea that women are weaker than men.<eos> You're playing right into the hands of Reston and into the hands of every other imbecile who thinks a woman isn't fit to be commander in chief.<eos> Yes, governor, I'm talking about you.
my flight is in six hours.<eos> but the captain texted me to come, so i'm here.<eos> what?<eos> you texted boyle when you told me you were texting your husband?<eos> as the person who's completely in charge here, i am very disappointed in you.
Oh, it's the least I could do.<eos> Hey, Chris, get over here.<eos> You got to meet my buddy Bob Hanley.<eos> Hi, Mr. Hanley. I'm Chris.<eos> I heard a lot about you, sir.
I told you that when we started this thing.<eos> Shut the door, Quentin.<eos> Shut the door, Quentin.<eos> Colonel, it's a pleasure.<eos> Our mutual friend speaks very highly of you.
You live alone, no kids, no pets.<eos> You wear an expensive perfume, go to the swimming pool with high contents of chlorine, you like strong coffee and you eat round things all the time.<eos> What are those?<eos> Round candies?<eos> So it's true what they say about you?
The only reason you sitting in this limo and not a Swiss dale 'cause you're my friend,<eos> - Ok? - Hilfa!<eos> - We're here, here, we're here. - I am more calm down, come on.<eos> Jordan Belfort, at last..<eos> Nicholas has told me so much about you.
Mr. Georges Duroy.<eos> I am Madeleine Forestier.<eos> You're married to Charles?<eos> Of course.<eos> Charles told me all about you.
Devrath Kulkarni.<eos> So what happened here?<eos> An accident, sir.<eos> The car crashed into the sea.<eos> I've heard a lot about you... it's an honour to work with you.
As for your disease, I certainly wouldn't call it end-stage.<eos> In fact, if you're not with us five years from now, I'll be surprised.<eos> What about 15 years?<eos> In 15 years, I suppose I'd be surprised for the opposite reason.<eos> I'm going to prescribe you some valium, which you can take next time you feel an attack coming, huh?
- I'm not from the South. - But you are... in my house, doctor.<eos> - So I'm afraid I must insist.<eos> On what? That I shake your hand?<eos> Oh, then I'm afraid I must insist in the opposite direction.<eos> - You know what I think you are?
Also, I wasn't in Goonies, I was in the other one.<eos> Well, that's what I meant.<eos> They're both good.<eos> Ricky Lloyd, right?<eos> My little sister was in love with you.
It's an honor, sir.<eos> You know me?<eos> Know you?<eos> I studied you.<eos> I even named a character after you in my comic.
Yes.<eos> Times a little tough, huh?<eos> I just started a practice of my own a few months ago.<eos> Yes, and I'm very impressed with what I've seen so far.<eos> That's why I thought of you specifically for this.
It doesn't mean it had anything to do with Rosie...<eos> What the hell are you doing here?<eos> Mr. Ahmed...<eos> I was wrong.<eos> I know Rosie cared for you...
On-- on the phone, you said that you knew my daughter.<eos> Do you work at the school or...<eos> You raised a good girl, Mr. Larsen.<eos> You should be proud.<eos> Rosie told me all about you.
Well, I googled.<eos> Come to find his mother... was your secretary way back in the day.<eos> Of course, you were married to Mrs. B., so, uh... No way there's anything naughty there, right?<eos> What do you need to get?<eos> It don't matter what Dale knows about you, 'cause that thing out there killing the kids -- it knows!
It's not that kind of bonus, Mr. Bohannon.<eos> It's much more valuable than money.<eos> Information.<eos> Oh, you... you're Lieutenant Griggs from the Calvary.<eos> I heard about you.
If you hadn't angered her before, she would have missed the boat.<eos> Now that you lied to her about her scores, you have no more cards left to play in New York.<eos> She has two months left to beat the Americans.<eos> And you know those people will make any sacrifice for their champions.<eos> I thought I could say the same about you.
What?<eos> Yeah, yeah, well you know, just for seeing.<eos> So you OK?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I was just thinking about you.
You should have let me help you. HE CHUCKLES<eos> And missed the look on your face?<eos> Jimmy?<eos> Someone call for the cavalry? Ah! HE CHUCKLES<eos> I've heard a lot about you, Mr Collett.
Well, I...<eos> I want to learn the occupation, 'cause I know I'd be good at it.<eos> I ain't gonna give you no guff.<eos> All right, look, you take me on, and I'll even split my wages with you.<eos> Well, sir, let me talk to Mr. Cline and Mr. McCoy about you.
Just because my son is able to name a legal theory Doesn't mean it makes any sense.<eos> Richard cole intentionally sabotaged the club So my client would default on his rent.<eos> [ sighs ] I try to run an amicable courtroom, mr. Franklin.<eos> So do I. Make him take it back.<eos> I meant you.
Okay.<eos> Generalissimo,<eos> This is Mr. White.<eos> Mr. White,<eos> I've heard of you.
Cofield.<eos> You were the Residency Director at Hopkins before you moved to Mercy. Which means it's safe to assume that you trained Foreman.<eos> Which means it's also safe to assume that he trusts you.<eos> This hearing isn't about me, Dr. House.<eos> I know you'd like to make it about me because then it wouldn't be about you.
Now, take your time.<eos> Your honor, with the court's permission, I'll continue the line of questioning.<eos> Isn't it true that you once got into a fight With your best friend over a girl?<eos> Amanda morris.<eos> Right, and you boiled over with so much rage That, in a fit of passion, you punched him.
I think--I think that's cool.<eos> Did I pass?<eos> I've taken a psych test before.<eos> Ah. Mr. Jane.<eos> We were just discussing you.
No, but I can't read with them off either.<eos> Who the hell is this?<eos> Uh, Jake, this is my partner.<eos> I'm detective Efrem Vega.<eos> I've heard a lot about you.
I've been tracking your political career for some time, and... your rise has been quite impressive.<eos> Well, I am flattered.<eos> Though why someone of your stature would be interested in a small-town monarch such as myself is a mystery to me.<eos> Humility is for humans.<eos> Do you know what I admire the most about you?
We've become so jaded.<eos> We celebrate our own cynicism.<eos> I want to help you.<eos> Why?<eos> Because something about you moves me.
And where do you stand?<eos> Well, you know me, I'm pretty much a law and order guy.<eos> But in this case, I think it serves the spirit of the law.<eos> Right.<eos> But the decision reflects on you as well, sir.
I assume so.<eos> The two men traveled to Brussels via rail, where they chartered a private jet to Newark International.<eos> I've yet to pinpoint their current location, but I would like to retask the team assigned to hunting for Alexandra and put them on the trail.<eos> So, now, Black Boxes are more important than Alexandra?<eos> They both hold secrets about you, sir, secrets we want to destroy.
Right, Victoria?<eos> Never.<eos> Emily. Emily, this is my grandfather, Edward Grayson.<eos> It's such a pleasure to meet you, sir.<eos> Daniel's told me so much about you.
I'm here to discuss your future.<eos> Mason Treadwell.<eos> I know who you are.<eos> You wrote that book about David Clarke.<eos> I may yet write one about you.
Ah.<eos> He does that. He'll be back later.<eos> This way.<eos> The handcuffs are no longer on me.<eos> They are on you.
Come on!<eos> How quickly can you leave an office?<eos> Terribly sorry about that, must be hire a cretin week.<eos> You stay.<eos> - I've been hearing a lot of good things about you, Mr Cole.
It's no small task, but I want to try.<eos> And I think, in spite of my sins, I can still serve the state well.<eos> My strength as a prosecutor has always been recognizing talent.<eos> I make it a point to surround myself with impressive people.<eos> Claire sees something in you, and I trust her judgment.
So you're trying to help me.<eos> Of course I am, Kenneth.<eos> I'm your friend.<eos> It's just... the other day you said in business<eos> I have no friends, and you were right about Bradley, so what does that say about you?
- Kerouac.<eos> - No, Kesey.<eos> Influenced by Kerouac.<eos> Common mistake.<eos> No, you.
Mr. Palmer, as tedious as this may seem, this is not the time to discuss your inexplicable desire to perform a Bette Midler number at your wedding ceremony.<eos> I want to sing "Wind Beneath My Wings" to my bride.<eos> So sue me.<eos> I'm sorry, Dr. Mallard, I've been under a lot of stress lately.<eos> I... You are not the only one with a burden.
I am not weaseling out of this.<eos> You hit that guy because of me!<eos> Oh, and that's supposed to be my excuse?<eos> I let McKay get to me, and I lost my temper.<eos> Because he was spreading lies about you.
Excuse me...<eos> Yes.<eos> Just the man I wanted to see.<eos> Brad Anderson from In Code magazine.<eos> We're thinking about doing a feature article on you.
I don't remember how long it was.<eos> Sarah?<eos> One, two months ago.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> I know she was writing an article about you.
Same thing.<eos> You're lucky people found you on the beach.<eos> Mr. Palmer's been with you the whole time.<eos> Are they all right?<eos> Let's just focus on you and this situation, and then later we can talk.
- Who knew bigots bought in bulk?<eos> - How'd you do that?<eos> Picking up five men, maybe six.<eos> I smell bad diets. And hate. And envy.<eos> There something I need to know about you, Mr. Merlotte?
We'll get you and your son out of here.<eos> You got a half hour or we're calling the police. We want our baby back.<eos> All right, we need to split them up and ask them some more questions.<eos> You ready to do your thing? Oh, yeah.<eos> Well, the funny thing, Mr. Kessler, is we can't seem to find any record of you or your wife.
And then two years ago, a few months after we got engaged, her meds just stopped working, which can happen, I guess.<eos> After that, things just started to snowball.<eos> - It must be really hard.<eos> - Yeah. She's definitely struggling.<eos> No, I meant for you.
- Any luck with our old friend?<eos> I'll have an answer for you shortly.<eos> You guys can go.<eos> I'm afraid you have me at a disadvantage, Mr. Crane, is it?<eos> You obviously know something about me, but I know nothing about you.
I wonder how much it costs to have somebody burn yo food around here.<eos> Four dollars, and it's bargain.<eos> Clay Winthrop.<eos> I write for the Star Reader.<eos> I'm working on a column about you.
Those mountain roads are gonna be dangerous without chains.<eos> So you're still thinking the Catskills?<eos> Hot showers and white weddings make for a good story.<eos> But we're gonna need more than that if we're gonna survive the winter. Yes, sir.<eos> I've heard a lot about you, Professor Mason.
- I want to thank you for coming.<eos> - I was surprised.<eos> You people usually handle this kind of thing on your own.<eos> You really don't know me very well.<eos> Mr. Savino, I pegged you the first moment I laid eyes on you.
I'll pour us some wine.<eos> Okay.<eos> Boy, these kids are cute as a button, just like Linette said.<eos> You know, your mama's been gushing about you all from the moment we met.<eos> Oh, well, she told us plenty of nice things about you, too...
I can have a harassment charge thrown down just like that, son.<eos> A minute of your time.<eos> Please. Some of us have proper work to do.<eos> Look, I can't believe you're stuck on for this.<eos> Hastings gives a toss about you having a free egg and bacon.
But now you know why you hate me.<eos> You're one insane, evil son of a bitch.<eos> Not insane.<eos> One day very soon, you will understand that.<eos> The reason you hate me... is that I am a constant reminder of the capacity for evil that resides... within you.
"Integrity."<eos> That's like another word for "bankruptcy."<eos> Just say, "Thank you, Teri," And go get me Leela.<eos> Thank you, Teri.<eos> Eric, my colleague's son, speaks very highly of you.
Mostly not so good.<eos> There is a treatment that can help lessen the physical... it's sort of a damper, like a flame retardant, sort of a reverse Viagra, if you will.<eos> That's the good news?<eos> Pretty much, I'm afraid.<eos> The emotional component is much more complicated, and without knowing more about you and the person you're in love with, it's nearly impossible to diagnose.
Detective Burkhardt?<eos> I'm Jess Reilly.<eos> I'm a guard over in juvie.<eos> Uh, Monroe asked me to stop by, see you.<eos> He really thinks a lot of you.
I'd like to give him a piece of my mind, that mop headed little...<eos> "LUKE". 3PO, I need your help.<eos> Master Luke!<eos> And you're in danger.<eos> I didn't mean those awful things I said about you.
Next time, I'm gonna play you blindfolded.<eos> I'd like to see you win every once in a while.<eos> Agent DiNozzo...<eos> and, uh...? Special Agent Gibbs.<eos> I've heard a lot about you.
What kind of--<eos> I told you about him before, right?<eos> President Kang, who's building townhouses in Jeju-do.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> We've heard a lot about you.
She loves the Grand Canyon, but for me, this... This is stunning.<eos> Great and audacious, humbling in its ambition and heart.<eos> You are that symbol.<eos> After the events of Pakistan and your actions against Indian imperialism, to the many who question where the heart of America lies, it's felt.<eos> Perhaps it lies in you.
Alan Marsh's cellphone.<eos> Now what were you doing there at the zoo?<eos> I never saw that man until the day he died.<eos> I swear it.<eos> Is he gonna write something bad about you?
Would you sign my copy of this book of your speeches?<eos> Of course.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Don't tell me you read the whole thing.<eos> I actually read it rather carefully. I found it absolutely fascinating. I also wrote my thesis about you.
It's called: "Vilem Rieger's Conception of Democracy".<eos> How did it turn out?<eos> I got an A.<eos> I've followed your ideas for years.<eos> Maybe I know more about you than you do yourself.
What do you...<eos> Mr. Marx!<eos> Come here.<eos> I've sometimes been rude, but times are hard.<eos> I have groceries going old and I thought of you.
Your wife is dead.<eos> I mean, I just saw her.<eos> We were just at home.<eos> Is there somebody that we can call?<eos> Someone who you think should be here with you?
May I help you?<eos> Excuse me. I... I knocked loud, twice, and no one came to the door.<eos> I'm Detective Lampkin.<eos> Detective Lampkin.<eos> Our sons told us about you.
Nothing.<eos> Hold me.<eos> I can't see.<eos> Linda, I need to go back there.<eos> I don't see any fresh burns on you, Detective.
And finally, Miss. Scarlett.<eos> It represents the tobacco industry.<eos> No need to say more.<eos> It is an honor to represent Io, sir.<eos> Most of what they say about you is not true.
Gymnasts are worse than baseball players at this kind of thing.<eos> She's superstitious.<eos> Hey, Katrina, how you doing?<eos> Nah, just this stupid retreat thing with the idiots from the office.<eos> No, no, no, not you, sir. Them.
Who's lovely?<eos> Who...<eos> We're all lovely.<eos> Kate Sumner, our behavioural psychologist.<eos> I've heard a great deal about you.
Back already?<eos> Are you making progress?<eos> Hey Dave.<eos> I want you to meet my daddy.<eos> I heard a lot about you.
Yes.<eos> Quiet down, please.<eos> Quiet.<eos> Mr Lewis, do you believe that Hank Moody set out to sleep with your daughter<eos> - as a way of getting back at you? - I most certainly do.
Your mother's was so dense so powerful ... that they verstofflicht before our eyes.<eos> - If you though.<eos> - Yes.<eos> You think I'm a crackpot.<eos> - But I know a lot about you.
- Then prove it by disappearing from her life.<eos> You do not spoil her future.<eos> You are still young.<eos> By the time you forget it.<eos> And they also forget you.
I lost track of time, it took forever for my bath to foam.<eos> - This room's a piggery.<eos> - Make me a coffee, I'm coming.<eos> What about the babyphone?<eos> It's supposed to always be with you.
Somebody set me up, okay? You'll have to explain this one, Mr. Kahn.<eos> You have to believe me.<eos> You stole the answers to three midterms, Mr. Kahn.<eos> I can't imagine ever believing in you again.<eos> This is really unacceptable, and I'm really, really disappointed in you.
You don't have to do that.<eos> It's fine.<eos> Let me finish.<eos> I feel like... I'm getting to know you.<eos> The real you, not my perception of you.
There's no need to respond.<eos> I know you're listening.<eos> So please don't hang up.<eos> I think we can be useful to each other.<eos> I've learnt a lot about you.
Can you think of anyone you put away who might want to harm you or your daughter?<eos> I haven't received any threats.<eos> Any cases stand out, though?<eos> Once I sentence someone, I don't think about them.<eos> Yeah, well, trust me, they think about you.
And wake up in a thousand years. If we wake up at all.<eos> Right.<eos> No, it's the only choice. No, it's not.<eos> I'll do it.<eos> If you stay out, it's automatic, you're dead.
You are free to go.<eos> - Ah, I gather Inspector Whicher has arrived.<eos> - Indeed, sir.<eos> Mr Whicher, this investigation will now be placed firmly in your hands.<eos> Your reputation goes before you.
I'm sure that Kyle has told you all about may 1st and all the other times I screwed up.<eos> Your son's a drama queen.<eos> He makes a big show of things and then forgets all about it later.<eos> Yeah, but it's usually me that sets him off.<eos> Kyle's always saying great things about you.
Well, life has no dress rehearsal, huh?<eos> Copy that.<eos> Can I ask you something?<eos> Can't promise I'll answer.<eos> Is it true what they say about you?
Your safety and our survival depend on it.<eos> Lisa.<eos> Chad Decker, WNT news.<eos> Yes.<eos> My mother speaks very highly of you.
Oh,great then..<eos> Sugar! Come here..<eos> Who is this dog?<eos> This is our famous decorator Djordje...<eos> I did hear a lot of nice things about you..
Yeah, why did Lang only go after Stills?<eos> I suggest you find out.<eos> Oh, here we go.<eos> Mr. Stills, can we talk to you for a minute?<eos> -No. -Well, we noticed that Carter Lang focused his efforts only on you.
She had a very gentle face. Put that down.<eos> Why?<eos> Just put it down.<eos> Fair enough.<eos> So Amber was making a documentary about you?
I may be hard to get hold of for a while. Did he say he'll take over?<eos> You must be Mr Worricker?<eos> - Joseph Pierpan.<eos> - How do you do?<eos> - My daughter's told me so much about you.
Really?<eos> That means something to you?<eos> Not yet.<eos> My fee is $5,000 a day.<eos> When I heard about you on the radio, I just assumed you were free.
But not to me, and I asked for both of you to come here today.<eos> Mr. Balagan, you ever wonder why Jake didn't hire a real private eye?<eos> Someone who could actually leave the hotel?<eos> Save on travel expenses?<eos> I read about you.
I had to kill someone.<eos> See, now you owe me several questions, but I'll settle for one.<eos> You wrestled with the greatest minds in the century, and now your only power is ordering room service.<eos> Why?<eos> Your questions tell me more about you than your answers do.
Well, I'm sure we can resolve this problem in a more amicable way.<eos> Sure.<eos> All you have to do is stop selling in my territory.<eos> Well, the truth is, Mr Larijani, that there are plenty of distributors in your patch begging me to supply them.<eos> Either they don't know about you or you about them, but they're out there.
Mr. Balagan...<eos> Yes.<eos> Oh, my God, Oleg Olesky?<eos> Sam, Sam Besht.<eos> Embarrassing, I did a project on you in seventh grade.
I've noticed it's getting worse.<eos> They haven't written to William yet, the Ministry I mean, but they have discharged me.<eos> Won't it just make extra work for them to have to fail me all over again?<eos> Very well.<eos> I shall correct my statement as regards William, but make no mention of you.
I could help you.<eos> You can't help me.<eos> You are an amateur, Mr Lyon.<eos> You know nothing about me.<eos> I know everything about you.
You too, Moneypenny.<eos> Where... where's Clarence?<eos> It's over, Freddie!<eos> Clarence?<eos> Mr Lyon. We were just talking about you.
Right? Now, i've been dying to get this piece of crap.<eos> Only thing is, i promised Stu i wouldn't go at it alone.<eos> Now, i wouldn't be breaking that promise If a certain someone decided to come with me, Now, would i?<eos> That's true.<eos> I'm talking about you, captain.
I think Shane staged all this 'cause he's involved in the recent burglaries and he needed to distract us.<eos> He's a good boy.<eos> I'm sure he's good to you.<eos> But I'm right, aren't I?<eos> He left shortly after you did, with his suitcase.
Knowing him, he'll be in a bar.<eos> He'll find one that matches how he feels inside.<eos> It'll be the most dark, depressing hole you can find in New Jersey.<eos> Now you're just pissing me off.<eos> - I'm really sorry. - I didn't know she researched you, - I had no idea she...
I got it from the one job I could count on.<eos> And I could outlast any kid.<eos> What are you doing here? Uh...<eos> This thing that I do... - ...it's what I'm good at.<eos> - Mm. Do you think I'm gonna tell on you, Mr. Breaker?
You know how many guys have copied that?<eos> Dad.<eos> He's joking.<eos> He didn't originate "stee-rike three."<eos> I can't believe Grant's never told me all these things about you.
She even told us as much when we interviewed her.<eos> The butler on that floor, William, he's always on my case.<eos> But Margaret already had a boyfriend.<eos> That's why, when she was given a lucky rose from the bride's bouquet, she kept it.<eos> And the man Margaret was in love with was you, Stefan, wasn't it?
So the property is in a kind of limbo.<eos> It doesn't exist.<eos> Neither do you.<eos> I did a little digging.<eos> I recognize, Mr. Reese, that there is a disparity between how much I know about you and how much you know about me.
- Takana.<eos> Take a seat.<eos> How are you today, sir?<eos> Fine. Thank you.<eos> My, we have a lot of notes on you.
So body builder, now tell me, what did you do to my daughter?<eos> Had I done something I wouldn't have brought her back in one piece.<eos> Out here they are killed and stuffed into an oven.<eos> I respect you a lot Sir,<eos> Dimple has told me everything about you, self-made man...
And let me tell you -- the best thing for you, young man, is to keep your mouth shut about all of this, huh?<eos> Now, pull away from here and drive slow.<eos> Why?<eos> Oh, for goodness sakes, for once, would you just do it, Mr. Goody-Two-Shoes?<eos> You have no idea how disappointed I am in you.
When I ask you to help us find Eric this morning, you said you wanted to keep out of it.<eos> Did you not see what happened when the three of us were together?<eos> Besides, there are some family things that I have learned to stay out of, and Tina is not...<eos> She's not my wife.<eos> And does she pressure you to marry her like you thought she would?
That doesn't seem to be working.<eos> Eh... I could increase the dosage, but I'm afraid it might kill her.<eos> Maybe it's meant to be.<eos> Mr. Englin, uh... you said it's always been like this.<eos> When was the first time this happened around you?
Spencer, do you... Need a ride or something?<eos> I have to talk to you.<eos> Okay, there's something that I need to tell you, but... before I tell you that, there's... There's something else that I need to tell you.<eos> Okay.<eos> I know about you and Aria.
Admire, sir.<eos> I've made a lot of sacrifices, Kitty, for the sake of all this.<eos> I know you have too.<eos> I appreciate it.<eos> Well, whatever you decide, either way, I'm here for you.
Based on blood, Dr. Parish determined that our victim is a male.<eos> So we're looking for missing persons reports of men in that area.<eos> Men? You've narrowed the victim pool down to men?<eos> Uh, well, in New York City, that actually eliminates over four million women, so...<eos> Mr. Castle, I don't know what the mayor sees in you, but I know how you're alike.
Yes, the ramblings of a mad old woman, no-one took her seriously.<eos> You believe your wife committed suicide.<eos> Obvious to anyone with half a brain.<eos> We've been to Angelique Morel's house now.<eos> We know exactly what she thought of you.
Sorry, Sheriff, but my professional courtesies don't extend to murder suspects.<eos> You're grasping at straws, lady.<eos> Actually, I think I've got one.<eos> Your deputy, Raymond Halloran?<eos> He's got a lot to say about you and a man named Hans Schroeder.
Oh, anything I can do to help with the investigation.<eos> So, James, what's your deal?<eos> You've devoted your life to the capture of a serial killer.<eos> That's either very saintly or very weird.<eos> Well, that's an odd notion coming from you, and I know about you, Mr. Jane.
- Mm-mmm. That's a shame because I could tell you... a lot about interpersonal aggression.<eos> My marriage for one thing. Not in a happy place right now. See?<eos> You do want to talk about it.<eos> I don't. I just want to- I just want to drink and get drunk and stumble home on the "T."<eos> The thing is, Dr. Harmon- I have a crush on you.
Our rates floated with the prime.<eos> It was an adjustable rate mortgage!<eos> Did you advise her of that?<eos> She had a lawyer, for God's sake!<eos> You were her banker... she had an ongoing relationship with you.
"Here Comes Santa."<eos> Is it possible you were changing a lightbulb?<eos> What, between his legs?<eos> Look, it was a joke. I was a college kid.<eos> Yes, but it's a joke about you fellating Santa.
Not that that's a surprise. For such a highly trained operative,Mr. Elliot,you are absurdly transparent...<eos> A single-celled organism.<eos> It's no wonder Percy assigned you to... Watch a Box.<eos> Now,Nikita... Is perhaps the most complex individual I have ever come across.<eos> I honestly don't know what she sees in you.
Capital that Herbert doesn't have.<eos> But I do.<eos> Or I will have.<eos> Mr Wemmick, I want to use my expectations to help Herbert but it has to be completely secret and I don't know how to go about it.<eos> So I... thought of you.
This is Liam Jackson.<eos> May I speak to Gil Ra-im, please?<eos> Liam Jackson?<eos> It's nice to finally get to speak to you.<eos> I've heard a lot about you.
- Marshal Daniels.<eos> - Doctor. Marshal Aule.<eos> - Thank you deputy warden, that will be all.<eos> - Yes, sir. Pleasure, gentlemen.<eos> He had a lot to say about you.
As for Rycart, the worst British Foreign Secretary since the war. Lang was right to fire him.<eos> - How well do you know Lang?<eos> - Hardly at all.<eos> - You seem surprised.<eos> - He mentions you in his memoirs.
Hang on.<eos> Coming.<eos> Hello. I'm Razia.<eos> This is Rizu. I mean Rizvan.<eos> I have heard a lot about you.
- Sounds very exciting.<eos> - It is.<eos> I just need to put together a consortium of investors.<eos> Anyway enough about me.<eos> Let's talk more about you.
They're barely old enough to have their driver's licenses.<eos> They're 18, I carded them.<eos> I'm going for a walk.<eos> I thought he wanted to be more impulsive. [ALL LAUGHING]<eos> MAN: I really didn't expect this out of you, Mr. McNamara.
Well, sir, I have a matter of some delicacy to discuss with you.<eos> Go on.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> I know that your time is valuable, so, I'll come right to the point.<eos> I understand Meredith Reed is writing an article on you for the Sunday Magazine.
- Mrs Widmore?<eos> - Yes? My name is Desmond Hume.<eos> I work for your husband.<eos> Of course, Mr Hume.<eos> Charles has told me so much about you.
I'm in the private sector.<eos> Your husband and I are colleagues.<eos> I appreciate your coming down here, but it's not...<eos> Nate Ford?<eos> He talked about you.
Under the circumstances, what do you expect me to do?<eos> How about contact the authorities, give them a little heads-up?<eos> Well, like you did!<eos> Why didn't you come in here and tell your colleagues there was gonna be another blackout?<eos> We're talking about you here.
Of course. Uh-oh!<eos> No way.<eos> I was wrong, sir!<eos> There is a sign!<eos> She's been thinking about you for years!
Why are you here now?<eos> He never told me he was sick.<eos> Oh, so you don't keep in touch.<eos> What's your point?<eos> Tony inherited his personality from you. But I get the feeling there's a lot about your life you don't share.
And with Buddy gone, staying that way will be a lot easier.<eos> I am not racist!<eos> I had 20 minutes to let people know that Toni Braxton was starting early and 273 text messages left before my rate tripled.<eos> Racial profiling may not be right, but it can be economical.<eos> When I refer to you in my article, would you prefer "imbecile" or "incompetent?"
You had me on cam time this morning.<eos> Yup. - I could've showered at least. I'm not smelling so fresh right now. - ( laughs )<eos> We really appreciate you squeezing us in on such short notice.<eos> At my age, long notice isn't such a great idea. I don't even buy green bananas. So how'd you find me?<eos> Oh, I read about you in " women's wear daily." Ah. Did they say nice things about me?
Okay.<eos> Chisholm said he caught the body snatchers in the morgue. But he was so freaked out by it that he had a heart attack and died.<eos> Then he claimed that they brought him back to life because they were extraterrestrials.<eos> Told everybody they experimented on his brain.<eos> Give me a way to get in touch with him, I won't mention you in the article once.
I could have.<eos> If I made it in time, I could have done that.<eos> And now you track down his killer and kill them.<eos> Yeah, well, you know how that works.<eos> I read all about you, Mr. Jane.
Why would a man want to take off his clothes when he has them on so cosy? THEY CHUCKLE DOOR RATTLES<eos> Peg Leg. Mr Arthur.<eos> I have a friend who wishes to help you.<eos> A journalist.<eos> He's asked me to persuade you to remain in Lark Rise until he can write a story about you, so he can raise up public opinion on your behalf.
- Mr. Arnett, could I ask you a question?<eos> - Shoot.<eos> Are you getting a blowjob in your office right now?<eos> I'm gonna call you back.<eos> Mr. Hawkins, I was just talking about you. And you've brought a friend.
Looks like you all are gonna mask for Mardi gras, huh?<eos> - That's right.<eos> - I'll be damned. What can I do for you, sir?<eos> Well, I come by to let you know We were able to work a few things on your behalf.<eos> The councilman hadn't forgot about you, sir.
I don't want to ruin your evening.<eos> Well, of course.<eos> Toni, why don't you run along ahead, and I'll join you in a bit?<eos> Don't want to lose our reservation. Well, it was a pleasure to meet you.<eos> Lane said so many nice things about you.
I wouldn't say I'm an artist.<eos> I'm an artistic person.<eos> I majored in literature, and I've dabbled in writing and painting and a little bit of acting.<eos> What are you laughing about?<eos> Because I just realized I Know everything about you.
I'm an artistic person.<eos> I majored in literature, and I've dabbled in writing and painting and a little bit of acting.<eos> What are you laughing about?<eos> Because I just realized I Know everything about you.<eos> I mean, you're in my head all day, even when I go home, and you don't know anything about me.
- Maybe.<eos> But it will change the way we think of him.<eos> It always does.<eos> I don't see why.<eos> I shouldn't care what I found out about you, whatever it was. It wouldn't alter my opinion one bit.
The president of the 'Lok Manch' Student's Council.<eos> He works along with minister Dayal.<eos> Inspector Chulbul Pandey.<eos> You wanted to see him, isn't it?<eos> I've heard a lot about you. - Thank you.
The nurse said I might only have a day or two left.<eos> She was being kind.<eos> You're Dr. House, aren't you?<eos> Oh, God, don't tell me we used to date.<eos> The limp, yeah, I read about you.
Sometimes I think it might be possible<eos> She is contaminating him.<eos> My son is not what... What he used to be.<eos> In what way do you mean?<eos> Mr. Sanyal, is there any reason Why your daughter-in-law would feel Uncomfortable around you?
- Thank you. - You're famous.<eos> Not really.<eos> She's famous.<eos> So what?<eos> Is there also a chapter about you?
Lucy found this in your loft.<eos> Huh? You're in league with them, aren't you?<eos> I'm not on trial, Sam.<eos> You wanna protect the United States, but as soon as you're threatened everyone else's rights go out the window?<eos> No wonder Lois is too afraid to be herself around you.
Yes, they got it right. "... looking for a way to get Kooky home."<eos> Precisely what I'm doing.<eos> We should go back and rip the Bagmen to shreds.<eos> - What does it say?<eos> - Now it's about you: "Kooky returns."
Have you had breakfast yet?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Wait a minute. Um...<eos> What did he say, exactly?<eos> He hasn't said anything bad about you, Mr. Evans.
You're my hero.<eos> Okay.<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Oh, I'm sorry, not you. It's...
This is my dad.<eos> - Coach Taylor, right? - Yes, sir.<eos> - Yeah, Ornette Howard.<eos> - Pleasure to meet you.<eos> I've heard a lot about you.
Yeah.<eos> Not too bad, though, huh?<eos> One of your former proteges.<eos> Hey, you did good.<eos> You know, uh, people are talking about you.
He's my business partner.<eos> I'm Shamoto, nice to meet you.<eos> Hello, my name is Tsutsui.<eos> I'm Mr. Murata's legal consultant.<eos> I've already told them about you, Mr. Shamoto.
You may, I won't.<eos> But I prefer you shove them up your ass.<eos> You lied to me, Mr. Dolworth.<eos> Late last night as I was waiting for my wife to return from her assignation, I did due diligence on your loan application.<eos> In other words, I Googled you.
Your son and your daughter-in-law?<eos> All four of them knocked on my door this morning.<eos> They made Naya ask me.<eos> She says, "grandpa, please take a shower."<eos> So how did that make you feel...
Rod is going to lose.<eos> How exactly did you find me, Mr. Scott?<eos> I'm a defense attorney, Mr. Westen.<eos> I know Miami's underworld.<eos> Your associate, Barry Burkowski -- he mentioned you.
I'm trying.<eos> I know, I know, and I'm sorry.<eos> I should have trusted your judgment earlier.<eos> And because I pushed you, I may have buggered everything.<eos> But I have complete faith in you, Mr. Beale.
I am so happy to see you.<eos> I've heard a lot about you.<eos> I hear you're an invaluable member of the HankMed team.<eos> Whip smart.<eos> Well, I've heard so much about you too.
And the family moved to Paris.<eos> And so when I was informed that it was in the market,<eos> I bought it immediately... and you are my nearest neighbour.<eos> Logan Mountstuart, I'ecrivain.<eos> They all talk about you.
Please, I know I'm asking you to take a risk and trust me, but you'd be taking a bigger risk not trusting me.<eos> You said you wanted to change the world.<eos> You can't do it as a dead man.<eos> And why do you so badly feel the need to save me?<eos> Because I know about you.
I know what I'm doing, Louise.<eos> But you could get into a lot of trouble.<eos> Mr Greene, you visited the pharmacy for what purpose?<eos> I ha... (Clears throat) I had a headache.<eos> According to your statement, the defendant and his now deceased accomplice, they entered the pharmacy approximately two minutes after you.
Have you come here to be accepted into the arms of Christ?<eos> I have never left him, Deacon.<eos> Though I have at times turned from his love.<eos> You cannot turn from him, sir.<eos> Whatsoever the compass point, he is there beside you.
How can I help you, sir?<eos> Morning...<eos> Denise.<eos> I'd like to make a withdrawal.<eos> Certainly. I can help you with that.
I heard about your analysis of the Kateb situation.<eos> That's good work.<eos> Thank you.<eos> A lot of smart people come in and out of this building, but... not many have what it takes to lead.<eos> I see that in you.
Call me, okay?<eos> I love you.<eos> Colonel Casey,<eos> I've admired your work for years, but this outpost and its personnel are unprofessional.<eos> And I'm disappointed in you.
I'm a novelist.<eos> I teach fiction writing in the mfa program.<eos> Really?<eos> I'm a...<eos> I'm sorry, I haven't heard of you.
Sure.<eos> I'll take your money.<eos> I'll get in on that action.<eos> Oh, uh, you know that phone call I just got?<eos> Found out something very interesting about you and your pal Doug.
Hey, Gracie.<eos> I'm Steve.<eos> It's great to meet you finally.<eos> Your dad, he talks about you all the time.<eos> Talks about you a lot, too.
- Make it out to Paul.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Can I ask you a question?<eos> - Yeah, of course, absolutely.<eos> Is true, what I read about you?
On a main road? No.<eos> She parks behind the soshe.<eos> The soshe?<eos> DHSS.<eos> And does she sell exclusively to you?
Try to keep up, Jan.<eos> This is a joint military/SHIELD facility working with one of the most advanced space based telescopes ever designed.<eos> And this is Dr. Philip Lawson, our lead scientist.<eos> I can't begin to tell you how pleased I am to meet you.<eos> Major Danvers has told me a lot about you.
I imagined this.<eos> Seven pounds, three ounces!<eos> And they're calling him Hector Greville Holland.<eos> It is very dignified.<eos> Not Warwick after you, then?
Him.<eos> - No.<eos> - Uh, Kevin?<eos> Come here.<eos> Be right with you.
When I first read your resume, I didn't quite know what to think.<eos> Your level of experience and your prior education are all going to factor heavily into my decision.<eos> Frankly, you're head and shoulders above the rest.<eos> I could hardly believe it.<eos> When I called all your references, they couldn't speak more highly of you.
About this exact moment?<eos> And does everything you dream come true?<eos> They're dreams, they're confusing.<eos> And what else have you dreamt about?<eos> About you.
How did I miss them?<eos> Aria, no one thought he'd be capable of doing what he did.<eos> He fooled all of us.<eos> Yeah, but you're not the one who was sleeping with him.<eos> And if it weren't for me, He wouldn't know things about you guys.
That is it, you son of a... wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!<eos> I am the only one who talks!<eos> Just about 30 hours from now, the President of the United States of America is going to stand up and give the state of the union address.<eos> He'll be discussing gun control.<eos> To do that, he needs to point to the two of you, because despite whatever is happening here, you are the face of gun control to the American people.
It's kind of funny how you got singled out in that class for not knowing the words, right?<eos> I mean, Jack McCall not knowing the words?<eos> That's a rarity.<eos> It was really sweet, Jack.<eos> It makes me very happy to see the two of you in that circle.
- But you can't believe everything that you hear in the press.<eos> Hey, Detective.<eos> Mark, what are you doing here?<eos> You do not like social gathering places.<eos> You know I put an APB out on you about an hour ago.
- I had a little help.<eos> So are you gonna tell me what this is about?<eos> - Maybe you should tell me about it.<eos> - Well, what's that supposed to mean?<eos> Peyton told me some things about the two of you.
Sissy, know what?<eos> Congratulations!<eos> Congratulations! Congratulations! Papa says that the more people say "congratulations" to you, the more good things will happen to you.<eos> That's why I'm telling you too, Sissy.<eos> Elicia... Looking at you like this, it's almost like you're siblings. Really...
anyway?<eos> What?<eos> Speak.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Sometimes I just ... I ... I look at you guys, and I ...
- Shane isn't you.<eos> - Shane concerns me. - Shane concerns me, too...<eos> - and all women, for that matter.<eos> - You got a problem here?<eos> Nope. Just a little sick of seeing the two of you sitting there.
He's a special operative<eos> A million dollars to the team that kills him<eos> Now get going<eos> Yes, sir<eos> I'm depending on you two
Hey... Hmm.<eos> Beautiful lady like you would be our pleasure.<eos> Waiter! We want two of the same and the lady will have... Tequila, straight.<eos> Tequila, straight.<eos> I've spoken to El Martillo about you two.
A missile?<eos> And what happens to the KIVA?<eos> Below the first leve l there won't be a KIVA.<eos> Mac, you got to get out of there.<eos> They've got a missile aimed at you.
Never underestimate the value of a European education.<eos> - No sign of Charriba?<eos> - Don't worry about that, Amos.<eos> He wants to drag it out.<eos> I think he figures on leaving stories about you that'll be told... around the campfires of his people for a thousand years.
You make it sound so simple.<eos> What about Judge Dawkins?<eos> Nobody cares that he signed off on Ed's plea deal.<eos> We're not talking about Judge Dawkins. We're talking about my brother.<eos> We're talking about you.
You've got a lot of nerve blackmailing me twice with the same tape.<eos> Yeah, I don't know. It just kinda felt like a two-chit tape.<eos> You know, now, especially. I hear you're running for the Senate.<eos> Burton, if you ever show up flaunting this tape in my face again, I swear to God, I'm gonna.<eos> Relax, hombre, you think I'm gonna care, when I'm drinking piña coladas on some deserted playa, about you and your 19-year-old fucking butt-buddy?
-Oh. -I wouldn't do that.<eos> Okay, well, maybe you should teach your dog some manners.<eos> I've been trying. He's, uh... he's not too smart.<eos> Really?<eos> Wow. Did you hear what he said about you?
It's me.<eos> It's two and a half years. I never heard a word.<eos> I...<eos> Oh, she was on the warpath.<eos> I have thought of you every day. A thousand times.
Henry.<eos> The Trident can never be found.<eos> I found you.<eos> It's just a tale.<eos> Like the tales of you and Captain Jack Sparrow?
You're all dismissed!<eos> Eh?<eos> All of ya, dismissed!<eos> Never sail with Captain Jack Sparrow again. Tell you that!<eos> The whole town speaks of you.
You're the evil spawn of them two?<eos> - Does mommy ever ask about me?<eos> Go on!<eos> Does she calls my name in her sleep?<eos> She never spoke of you.
"Arms reach empty handed... "... God to a city in love with..."<eos> Wait.<eos> - What just happened?<eos> - I don't know, he kinda lost me here.<eos> No, I mean with you. - Nothing.
Weapons!<eos> You silly bastards. Determined to die.<eos> Shit. On my command!<eos> I'm going down the hole now.<eos> After you.
I'm fucked anyway.<eos> We been friends 20 years.<eos> You gonna fuckin' rat on me?<eos> What do you mean, rat on you?<eos> I got all the information on you and could've took you down.
- With pleasure.<eos> Hey, everyone!<eos> Yeah, kick- ass party.<eos> Hey, what's up, Liz?<eos> Peter told me a lot about you.
None of this would've happened if you had just listened to me.<eos> If you even cared, you'd actually be here.<eos> I did listen, kid.<eos> Who do you think called the FBI, huh?<eos> Do you know that I was the only one who believed in you?
But then, you did the right thing.<eos> You took the dog to the free clinic, you...<eos> Raised the hybrid puppies...<eos> All right, not my best analogy.<eos> I was wrong about you.
Covenant.<eos> Covenant.<eos> Do you read me?<eos> Covenant, come in.<eos> I will always be with you.
Entirely unworthy of his creation.<eos> I pitied him at the end.<eos> Now, raise your fingers as I put pressure on them.<eos> Bravo!<eos> You have symphonies in you, brother.
Who the hell are you?<eos> Who am I?<eos> The more relevant question, Mr. Morton is:<eos> Who exactly are you?<eos> In theory, I know all about you.
We are three elderly men, If we are bankrupt and bankrupt,<eos> We will retire with dignity.<eos> At worst, they will catch us, And we get a bed And three meals a day. And health care Better than that we have now.<eos> Are you talking about us?<eos> You and you?
Chutsky, we're gonna see you on the cover of out magazine with a dick in each hand and shame in your eyes. Like this.<eos> Hey, you smell that?<eos> - Smells like pussy. - Why would it smell like pussy?<eos> Oh, hey, ocre.<eos> What's up? We were just talking about you.
Wow, it's beautiful. I cannot decide if I wanted the gold or silver, but my parents said that if my grades were good next quarter, - then they'd get me both.<eos> - You're so lucky.<eos> My parents got me this necklace for my birthday. - Mm.<eos> - It's nice, but still.<eos> What about you, Ella? Don't your parents ever send you anything?
What, is it about him?<eos> - It's about all of us, like.<eos> - All of you?<eos> About me?<eos> - No, not about you.
You and me.<eos> You know, I killed a man once.<eos> A man who'd done nothing to me.<eos> Cunt just looked at me the wrong way in a moment when I was thinking of you.<eos> I've been thinking about you for 20 year.
This plan of yours is dangerous.<eos> I would risk anything to kiss you again, Plumette. No, my love.<eos> I've been burned by you before.<eos> We must be strong.<eos> How can I be strong when you make me so weak?
Okay.<eos> Watch this one.<eos> Incredible.<eos> I get that you're all connected.<eos> But I feel way more relaxed around you.
Lucy!<eos> - Oh, shit.<eos> - You all right?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Heard about what happened to you and Ben.
Mike, come on, this is crazy.<eos> I'm outta here.<eos> Go.<eos> I thought you were on my side.<eos> You have to know that first and foremost, I was thinking about you and your well-being.
I've done nothing with my life.<eos> He destroyed me.<eos> Bullshit. He took time off to be with you.<eos> Paul, he's a busy man.<eos> He cares about you.
The shots mellow the seizures. The pills keep them from happening.<eos> How about you blow on them to make them safe?<eos> Fuck off, Logan.<eos> So you remember who I am now.<eos> I always know who you are.
Who are you?<eos> You know who she is, Logan.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> Does she remind you of anybody?<eos> I read about you when I was a kid.
- I don't either.<eos> Because technology's always changing. You gotta keep up.<eos> Otherwise, you're one of those dumb families that doesn't have a MacBook Pro.<eos> I ruined the surprise.<eos> Now, let's talk about you.
- Good.<eos> - Without protection.<eos> By the way, did that twin say anything to you about me?<eos> No.<eos> He doesn't talk to me about you at all.
Yeah, getting locked up.<eos> It's fucking...<eos> This is some BS, right?<eos> Shit.<eos> I... I don't mean to, you know, interrupt your seething or whatever it is you're doing over here, but I just got in a little argument with my friend and he starts talking some serious shit about you.
Hmm. So what do you teach here?<eos> I teach gym, but I'm a singer.<eos> Can I sing a song to you?<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Shorty, I'm there for you Anytime you need me
- Our need is great.<eos> - No.<eos> You will not, brother. - You disobey me again?<eos> You are not worthy to carry the relic.<eos> There is something in you, boy ...
What is your heritage, Mr. Quill?<eos> My mother is from Earth.<eos> And your father?<eos> He ain't from Missouri. That's all I know.<eos> I see it within you.
That plaque for your mother is just a piece of metal in the ground. Okay?<eos> Her ashes was spread across the Pacific Ocean.<eos> You deserve to know that.<eos> She's not out there, Gardner.<eos> She is in you.
Just what I need!<eos> Nance.<eos> How's London? Is that rain?<eos> That can't be good for the golf.<eos> Just letting you know I'm thinking of you.
but she really frightens people.<eos> She reminds them of Daddy.<eos> This is mine.<eos> This is my project.<eos> She just wants to support you on your special day.
Yo, what does this do?<eos> Yeah, you cook.<eos> Yes, I cook, okay?<eos> Found the furniture.<eos> I've heard about you and all the girls.
Fuck you. You fucking bastard!<eos> I've known about this affair.<eos> I've known about this affair all along.<eos> Now, you lookee here.<eos> I know about you and George and maybe somebody else too!
Why do you let him make you... do these things?<eos> Roger... you better hope that you never get involved with someone like him.<eos> Never have someone like him in your life.<eos> Jack, you barely touched your three dinners.<eos> Darya said something about you, being worried about tomorrow?
No.<eos> No? Where was she?<eos> Stay in your seat.<eos> Heather...<eos> We got you, Danny.
too.<eos> are you sure you should be saying this?<eos> It's okay.<eos> Danny needs to know this.<eos> So... there I was. not to mention you and Heather.
I have an early morning deadline.<eos> don't give the front page to Karen.<eos> I've got a hell of a story for tomorrow.<eos> - What happened to you?<eos> - What happened to you?
Keep him calm.<eos> - Sabina, do you hate me?<eos> - I don't wanna do this.<eos> You're doing great.<eos> He's... he's focused on you.
- Yeah?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Come here.<eos> You just gotta let me know you're safe.<eos> I'm here for you.
Mom! Mom!<eos> It's gonna be okay.<eos> Stay in your seat.<eos> Heather!<eos> We got you, Danny.
There's something I'd like to show Danny first.<eos> Yeah. Sure.<eos> She's very special.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Colleen has spoken to me about you quite a bit.
Yeah. Sure.<eos> She's very special.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Colleen has spoken to me about you quite a bit.<eos> That's funny... she's never mentioned you.
Colleen brought me.<eos> - Are you coming onboard here?<eos> - Oh, thinking about it.<eos> That would be so kick-ass.<eos> I... I've been telling them about you.
The world is more complicated than what a bunch of monks think.<eos> - The Hand is evil.<eos> - You're wrong!<eos> Why are you even here, Colleen?<eos> Because... because I care about you.
I don't want the same thing to happen with you.<eos> When my parents died, I... I always felt this need to find a family.<eos> At first, I... I thought it could be in K'un-Lun.<eos> And then, I thought it could be with the Meachums, but...<eos> But what I found in you is... It's new.
So, what do you say?<eos> Yeah, I'll talk to you.<eos> Good.<eos> Where are you from?<eos> Listen, I don't know shit about you, so why don't you go first?
Got it.<eos> - Thank you, Ms. Asher.<eos> You can fight.<eos> You can take a punch.<eos> Claire said they did experiments on you.
That's what I wanted.<eos> And you?<eos> You wanted more than K'un-Lun.<eos> That's why you abandoned it, isn't it?<eos> They told me all about you.
Did he tell me his name? I forgot it.<eos> - Have a good night, guppy. Oh...<eos> Thanks.<eos> The last shuttle will be leaving in five minutes.<eos> I'm telling you, Mae-Mae, there's something about you.
We need to know what the people who represent us are doing with their time on our dime to serve us better.<eos> Well, I'm happy to report there is a woman who is taking all of this very seriously, and is taking some pretty dramatic steps to address the problem.<eos> So, please join me in welcoming Olivia Santos, congresswoman for District 14.<eos> That's right, Tom.<eos> I am as concerned as you are about the need for citizens to know what their elected leaders are doing!
And that's Charlie, and that's Frank.<eos> And he's left-handed.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Oh.<eos> I suppose I didn't know that about you.
Santino will lay claim to my seat at the Table.<eos> He will take New York.<eos> And you will have been the one who gifted it to him.<eos> What would your Helen think about that, John?<eos> What would your Helen think about you?
The things you want, you said that's the way you are.<eos> But what happened last time, that's not gonna happen again.<eos> How can you say that?<eos> I know that I asked you to show me how far it can go, but you were getting off on the pain you inflicted.<eos> That's still in you.
I like it.<eos> I'll call you tomorrow.<eos> Okay.<eos> Good night.<eos> Ana, I've been hearing a lot of good things about you.
He told me what happened.<eos> I know you're in a lot of pain.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> He lets you call him by his name.<eos> He talks about you all the time.
You've made such a difference to him.<eos> He never let anyone get close until you came along.<eos> Grace, he adores you.<eos> I know, but children grow apart from their parents, and that's fine, as long as they're happy.<eos> And he is happy with you.
This is DI Hardy. I'm at Axehampton House.<eos> We have a possible crime scene.<eos> Sorry, sorry. It's been one of those days.<eos> Who am I kidding? It's always one of those days.<eos> Right. Let's talk about you.
Very reputable.<eos> A liar, a murderer, and now a smuggler.<eos> Lovely.<eos> Careful, I might get offended.<eos> I wasn't referring to you.
I don't wanna keep you waiting any longer.<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> So we still don't have a trial date.<eos> That will take a while but you know management will provide all the legal coverage you need, so.<eos> We're thinking of you, Jake.
Wait, 20 minutes?<eos> Where you going?<eos> Who the fuck are you?<eos> Shane Vincent, AR.<eos> Lucky man. Your girl adores you, talks about you all the time.
Do you have any?<eos> Yeah. I do.<eos> Thanks, Shane.<eos> Of course.<eos> Tonight... I know I ought to tell Shao about you, Yale.
- Boo! - No. Don't boo.<eos> Don't boo. She's a lovely girl.<eos> A little mousy if you ask me, but who is Misty to judge?<eos> Okay. Okay, so maybe I heard she fucked Roy Asheton.<eos> You hearing what she's saying about you, Mylene?
- Whoo! ♪ Turn the lights down ♪<eos> ♪ Come in ♪<eos> ♪ Now let the games ♪<eos> ♪ Begin ♪<eos> ♪ I'm warming up To meet the devil in you tonight ♪

It's your cousin.. He's in trouble, come quickly!<eos> Please don't do this, Understand my problem.<eos> You know I can't make living without my car.<eos> Isn't my problem bro.<eos> Dominic Toretto.. I heard about you.
Well, well, well...<eos> Luke Hobbs behind bars.<eos> Would you look at that?<eos> The band cop got it's day.<eos> You know, that color looks good on you.
Will do.<eos> Let me see your gun.<eos> Keep driving. What! What's wrong, Money?<eos> How many guns did you tell Shotgun you had total?<eos> Same as I told you!
How ya doin'?<eos> I'm okay. How are you?<eos> You know that I think of you as a son.<eos> I did not know that, but thank you.<eos> I guess I feel like, sometimes I think of you as a father in a way...
Go and wash your hands.<eos> No need for any more questions.<eos> Not when half of London will be retelling the story anyway.<eos> So I shall hear through gossip?<eos> As I hear about you.
He must have known we were coming.<eos> How, how did he know?<eos> Very well.<eos> We will allow him to think he is one step ahead... while we exploit what is undefended.<eos> And to you, your church on Earth and in Heaven, we offer honour and glory, now and for ever.
Okay. Come upstairs, let's talk.<eos> No, I...<eos> I think what I need is sleep.<eos> We're gonna be okay.<eos> I just wish that you had as much faith in me as I have in you.
Alex Straight.<eos> Are you going to order something or not?<eos> Yeah, I'll have a v-vodka soda.<eos> Okay.<eos> I didn't know about you.
- Hello.<eos> - Pleasure.<eos> I made good on my promise to Wren that night.<eos> And when the game was over, I went back to London.<eos> But I just... I couldn't stop thinkin' about you.
Please, Wren!<eos> - I can't do this!<eos> - Do it!<eos> Oh... - Hey. - It's okay.<eos> I got you, I got you, I got you...
Norman, you do not have autonomy here.<eos> You can't just make unilateral decisions about everybody else, like you're the little dictator.<eos> I am just driving to a meeting.<eos> I know what you're doing, and I know why you're doing it.<eos> I know everything about you... What scares you, what you want, what you Google.
Wait, uncle Maximo. What is a virgin?<eos> It's an airline.<eos> Last lesson of the day...<eos> Your walk.<eos> Your walk tells more about you than your mouth ever can.
Not our pineal gland, I hope.<eos> We're still using them.<eos> I want you to help me find a Hellhound.<eos> You were tracking him. You lost his scent.<eos> I found him on you.
Put ben back on the phone.<eos> Good luck.<eos> What is he not supposed to tell me?<eos> I don't want him talking about his case, And I don't want you talking about your new job. Or any of your old jobs.<eos> Well, then, I guess we're gonna have. To go back to talking about you.
How... how... How did you get out? Um...<eos> Technicality.<eos> He made a deal.<eos> You know what, enough about us.<eos> Let's hear about you.
So you will effectively be my bodyman in case somebody tries to kill me.<eos> I can't think why anyone would want to do that.<eos> The bank manager will escort me into his office, leaving you free...<eos> To tap into the CCTV footage, which will appear on these monitors here, which I set up all by myself 'cause this is what I do for a living.<eos> Is she like this with you?
It'll soak up the poison.<eos> You have to drink it all. Swallow, Lucas, swallow.<eos> Dorothy. Dorothy! Dorothy!<eos> Did you get them?<eos> Are her spells inside you?
Stoked a fire.<eos> But running off like he did is a blood crime,<eos> Mistress-New-Mistress.<eos> Running off is a blood crime. Understand?<eos> Mistress never spoke of you.
She gave life to every witch in Oz, and even she found the time to care for me. Nurture me.<eos> But your mother couldn't care less about one baby girl?<eos> How rotten do you have to be for that?<eos> She must've sniffed it out.<eos> Something in you that's broken and couldn't ever be fixed.
Same as you.<eos> Is it really you?<eos> It's my fault.<eos> It's my fault you're not sure.<eos> I wasn't there for you when you needed me most.
Look at you.<eos> The way you dress, the way you act.<eos> That wig.<eos> You're just lying to everyone.<eos> I could say the same about you.
Ready to serve you and our mother.<eos> When you were a little girl, mother south favored you.<eos> Of all of our sisters, you were the one destined to take her place.<eos> Did you know that?<eos> Did you know that she saw you as her heir?
Lucas, not like this...<eos> Look at me!<eos> At least look at me!<eos> Now that I've got all this witch stuff inside me, can't we just, you know, fly to wherever?<eos> If we fly, Glinda will find out about you.
I can't imagine anyone trusting you with their life. Oh...<eos> Wait, your partner.<eos> He did just before he got gunned down in front of you.<eos> Oh, so, you know something about me.<eos> I know something about you.
You're treating us.<eos> And you are demonizing him.<eos> Does he know you're here alone?<eos> Hey.<eos> I was just thinking about you.
This is my last e-mail.<eos> We're moving back to New York.<eos> We're leaving tonight, when my dad's out drinking.<eos> My mom wants to do it at night, because she's afraid she won't be able to do it if he's right in front of her.<eos> I finally told her about you.
That's right, I killed you!<eos> I killed you fucking dead! No!<eos> You are not a god!<eos> She said that I was killed by a god.<eos> You are a lot of things, but you are not a god.
And he ain't even yesterday anymore.<eos> I heard about the trouble you had with the Technical Boy.<eos> I was impressed with how you dealt with him.<eos> Efficient, no-nonsense, effective.<eos> Who'd have thought you had it in you?
- Jake got an agent.<eos> I got an assistant's card.<eos> What?<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Okay, enough about you.
Are you ready?<eos> I can't do it for you.<eos> I had a dream about you.
I fucking hate it.<eos> Then don't be fucking political.<eos> How do I fix this?<eos> Uh, leave it alone.<eos> He'll forget about you in a couple of days.
We're happy you're okay.<eos> Emmett, that's incredibly dangerous.<eos> Are you taking other drugs out there?<eos> Bay:<eos> Emmett, we care about you.
I said it's just me.<eos> Why do I have the gun?<eos> So Amanda's playing hockey now, huh?<eos> You got to get up at the crack to get that...<eos> She mentioned you the other day.
As is the silence.<eos> See, I can guarantee... that one of the reasons you're still listening is that you really want to know... who are the others?<eos> Who else is responsible for my death?<eos> Well, you're going to learn soon enough.<eos> And, of course, they're going to learn about you, too.
Later.<eos> Okay, seriously, how does he get all the hot girls?<eos> I mean... his dick must be huge.<eos> Only one huge dick in the vicinity at the moment, Bryce.<eos> Whoo! She's talking about you, big guy.
You were thinking of Hannah.<eos> I wasn't.<eos> That's okay.<eos> I wasn't... I wasn't thinking of anyone.<eos> But... but you.
- Don't.<eos> - Why not?<eos> Because.<eos> Well, do your folks know?<eos> About you and Hannah?
Okay, fine.<eos> Come here.<eos> Seriously, Clay?<eos> Get over it.<eos> It was you she was talking about, right?
And the music was loud, but I saw his face.<eos> And I recognized his voice as clear as day.<eos> And so would all of you.<eos> But this tape isn't about him.<eos> It's about you and me, Justin.
See?<eos> Now, look, if I can do that, I can drive home. Come on.<eos> You got it?<eos> Now I wonder if we would have both been better off staying at the party.<eos> Sheri, this one's for you.
Because how could I have known?<eos> But it was the same night. That same awful night.<eos> Remember that story I was saving for later?<eos> Well, this is it.<eos> And it's all about you...
I climbed up this crane, all the way up there, and I could... I could see the whole city.<eos> And I was gonna jump.<eos> Or shoot myself.<eos> But I couldn't.<eos> Because I couldn't stop thinking about you. I can't stop.
I don't care.<eos> You will.<eos> Someday, you will.<eos> Someday.<eos> Even if you can persuade her to keep you... she'll no longer be enough.
I want every last grain of lemonade you got left.<eos> I want a person of your own choosing... for Lucille.<eos> Daryl...<eos> Ooh, I gotta get me my Daryl back.<eos> I see you.
Two old guys fucking slapping each other around for three rounds?<eos> That's a legends fight.<eos> No fucking thank you.<eos> No, thank you.<eos> I don't think you're that old.
Fuck legacy.<eos> I don't care how some motherfucker sees me in his head, you know?<eos> It's, uh... It's useless.<eos> You fucking die, you're gone.<eos> Nobody's thinking about you.
Man, you got a problem.<eos> What?<eos> Um... people know, man.<eos> People know what?<eos> Um, about you.
Be careful.<eos> God is listening.<eos> Well, I just hope he's not watching.<eos> Is there something I can do for you, Alvey?<eos> I had a dream about you.
Why do you still talk to me?<eos> That's a loaded one.<eos> I wasn't good to you.<eos> Hey, I was too high to notice.<eos> I've been thinking about you a lot, you know.
- You ever put anyone to sleep?<eos> No.<eos> No, I never murdered anybody at work.<eos> You're a very docile man, Mac.<eos> I like that about you.
What do you guys think about doing this once a week?<eos> Ugh.<eos> You must be Rick.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> I've heard a lot about you today.
No, but he knew how to liquidate his fellow men.<eos> I think we're ready to carve.<eos> Every action, equal and opposite. Reaction.<eos> Peace without turmoil.<eos> I put my hand upon you.
I think we're ready to carve.<eos> Every action, equal and opposite. Reaction.<eos> Peace without turmoil.<eos> I put my hand upon you.<eos> I put my hand upon you.
He loves you.<eos> Did you know that Matt won't let me cross the city limits?<eos> He thinks if I go over that bridge, the magical spell that woke me from my slumber will break and I'll go back into a coma.<eos> Listen, I know Matt can get carried away, but his heart's in the right place.<eos> He's writing a book about you.
We're in trouble here!<eos> Enemies are at the gates!<eos> Inside the gates!<eos> Fornicating with our cookware!<eos> What is the point of you?
Inside the gates!<eos> Fornicating with our cookware!<eos> What is the point of you?<eos> What?<eos> The point. What is the point of you?
Come alone.<eos> Nice sweater.<eos> It's a cardigan.<eos> Hello? Yeah,it'sme . It 'sGloria.<eos> Oh, hey, there. I was just thinking of you.
- That is you.<eos> Your family will come soon and find you.<eos> They will do right by your body and bury you as is proper.<eos> They will be sad for a time, then they will find happiness again.<eos> Your Assaf will marry in a year and name his first daughter for you.
I'm not ready for this.<eos> Well, maybe it's like jumping into cold water.<eos> I mean, you're never ready, but once you get in, you get used to it and you're glad you did it.<eos> I'm not talking about us.<eos> Fine, let's talk about you.
Did you ever once stop to think about how it would affect my sisters or me?<eos> You?<eos> You get out of your head, girl.<eos> I was to the point where I was ready to take my last breath.<eos> I wasn't thinking about you.
You?<eos> You get out of your head, girl.<eos> I was to the point where I was ready to take my last breath.<eos> I wasn't thinking about you.<eos> And I promise you, in that moment, your precious P.J. wasn't thinking about you either.
Oh, shit.<eos> Exactly.<eos> If this witness takes the stand, he draws a straight line through everything, and that line leads to you.<eos> It's time to be straight up with me, Pernell.<eos> What do I need to know about you and Shane Caldwell, and Julio Farcas?
She lost her phone, buy her a new one like we usually do.<eos> Usually, we don't give a shit, but not this time.<eos> I know you got a thing for the judge, but I want that fuckin' phone.<eos> And if the video got erased somehow, I'm gonna feel personally responsible.<eos> And I'm gonna personally take it out on you.
Briefing in five.<eos> I think I hear something.<eos> Violins.<eos> Schubert in d-minor.<eos> I think the lieutenant has the hots for you, Bobbie.
That's not what I meant.<eos> I hope not.<eos> Otherwise, you should feel free to ask the Director for someone you're more comfortable with.<eos> You know what?<eos> I don't think so. I think I'll stick with you.
Well, maybe I don't like the idea of you worrying about me anymore.<eos> You can go right in.<eos> - Carrie.<eos> - Madam President.<eos> David and I were just speaking about you.
He will have men hump you.<eos> I tell you every time... you do not need to live like this.<eos> You don't need to eat and sleep with hounds.<eos> It is my wish.<eos> I dream of you... as you were.
And if he wanted me to know, he would've fucking told me.<eos> Gotcha.<eos> You brought your book.<eos> It's not my book. It's Matt's.<eos> But it's about you.
He's there in Australia?<eos> Did you tell him where I was, Laurie? No. No, I didn't.<eos> - Because if you did, just say so, and I...<eos> We established boundaries the first time you called me. Clear boundaries.<eos> I don't tell you about the people here, and I don't tell the people here about you.
- What about you?<eos> Did you ever get married again?<eos> No.<eos> Why not?<eos> Because I'm still holding a candle for you.
And he asked me if I had come all that way, why in God's name did I wanna go back?<eos> And I told him it's because I didn't belong there.<eos> So, he built it. And I came back through.<eos> I came back here.<eos> Did I... think about you?
How is this not just the next storm in a very long line of them?<eos> You told me once that the people he holds closest are the most at risk of being consumed by him.<eos> And he and I have discussed it at length.<eos> So, I thank you for your concern. But I'm going to be just fine.<eos> And I'm not talking about you.
Hey. What's wrong?<eos> Look at me.<eos> You have to finish mixing the explosives.<eos> Have you forgotten what these people did to you?<eos> What they said about you with those other students?
You keep doing what I say - and you'll walk away from this.<eos> Make transcripts available to the press and if anyone asks about Rebecca Ingram's absence just refer them to me.<eos> Nilaa.<eos> Can you excuse us for a moment?<eos> Gage's campaign is releasing an attack ad tomorrow... about you.
This operation just became priority number one.<eos> So, Jerome's staying here to look after Nicole, all right?<eos> Since when you need my permission?<eos> Aisha, look, this business ain't never been easy, all right?<eos> If I've been taking it out on you, I'm sorry.
Um, no one knows.<eos> They found him lying by the soccer field.<eos> I'm so glad you're here.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> He really cares about you.
He'll come after us!<eos> You know as well as I do, we'll never be safe.<eos> We'll never have peace.<eos> Khasan, you're all right. Come here, come here.<eos> - [grunting] I'll bandage you. I'll clean you up.
How soon until you're ready?<eos> We're close, we're almost done with his medical screens.<eos> How far away is your husband?<eos> Minutes.<eos> I've been able to learn about you.
I'd like to talk to you in private, now.<eos> Yeah, come on.<eos> Look, I don't know if you found anything, but just have CTU check anyway. Roger that, sir.<eos> Senator.<eos> Rebecca talked about you, talked about you a lot, about your missions together.
Rebecca's ambulance is exiting 29.<eos> - What are you working on?<eos> - Signal lights.<eos> I want that ambulance to hit green all the way through.<eos> What Nicole said... that there's something inside you that... scares her?
What amazing story is there to rationalize this?<eos> I walked into a cafe one night to study, and when I looked up, the guy taking my order was Tank, and my first thought was,<eos> "I need to get out of here!"<eos> But then we started talking.<eos> About you, actually, and how you were doing, and...
I would have gotten her to the hospital sooner.<eos> How is she doing now?<eos> She's working her way back.<eos> But we finally got her out of the wheelchair for a little bit last week.<eos> I'm so sorry I wasn't here for you.
- Yeah, she seemed... - Exactly.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I felt the same.<eos> Here. Lick this.<eos> So, rather than allowing myself to be paralyzed by doubt, a mistake I have made in the past, I am considering a more, you know, proactive approach, like you or Sun, and simply telling Rajan everything.
Are you helping me because undermining Mandiba's control over this city is good for your business interests?<eos> The easiest decisions in this world are those where what is good for business is also good for your family.<eos> F... Family?<eos> You know I'm deeply indebted.<eos> And you know my daughter cares very much about you.
Oh, my God.<eos> Lito, you have to get up, right now!<eos> If you don't do it...<eos> No, I'm gonna make you do it, because it's so freaking perfect.<eos> It's you and Hernando. It...
No, his friend.<eos> Interesting.<eos> Why? Why is that interesting?<eos> Because both of the men in your life are connected to criminals.<eos> What does that say about you?
Come here, I want you to meet our Jordi.<eos> This is Marc Jacobs, he's our designer.<eos> And Charlie.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Kit told us all about you.
♪ It's Devon.<eos> ♪<eos> What'd she do?<eos> I'm not sure even I want to know all the details, but it's not good.<eos> Could it blow back on you?
We are so fuckin' resilient. Even when we really don't want to be.<eos> I've already tried to kill myself once.<eos> And you are still here, right?<eos> Not so easy to shake this mortal coil.<eos> Until someone sits on you till you die.
Well, on that note, I crown you Queen Alice the Wise.<eos> No, wait.<eos> Since we're cleaning slates and shit, give me.<eos> Q.<eos> Uh, I could start by saying something cruel yet totally hilarious about you.
I hope you don't mind him.<eos> - It's all right.<eos> So..<eos> Mrs. Mukherjee..<eos> Whenever she talks about you all she does is sing praises of you.
"I've gotten used to you."<eos> "Since a few days"<eos> "you've become my habit."<eos> "Your smile makes me smile."<eos> "I want to get lost in you."
I envisioned a society that was entirely different.<eos> Yeah, II think we all did.<eos> It's not without its beauty, though.<eos> I must take issue with something that you said earlier.<eos> There is absolutely nothing mediocre about you.
- I just want to talk, actually.<eos> - Talk?<eos> - I unexpectedly found myself... Caught up in your family's drama.<eos> Is that the word?<eos> And I don't know anything about you.
- Hi.<eos> - Asha.<eos> - Right.<eos> Sorry, um...<eos> I-I just wanted to tell you that Cali never stopped talking about you.
Okay, you do that.<eos> You call your lawyer, and he'll get you out in no time.<eos> But that's when I get started.<eos> What is that supposed to mean?<eos> I'll be all over you.
What happened that night? Okay, I needed him.<eos> I needed someone and he wouldn't even talk to me.<eos> I understand, all right?<eos> You felt abandoned.<eos> No one was there for you.
When... When do you leave?<eos> I'm not going.<eos> But you're the lead on the case.<eos> You're about to bury your dad.<eos> I want to be here for you.
He loved you.<eos> Yes.<eos> I don't know why I'm crying.<eos> It's okay.<eos> No, I mean, I don't know... why I'm crying with you.
I know this is not how we thought we were going to take your career to the next level, but, sweetie, if you sign this contract, you are going to be able to do whatever you want.<eos> No. There's no way that I'm doing this.<eos> Did I do something wrong?<eos> Not at all.<eos> In fact, Kyle had nothing but good things to say about you.
That's what the contract and the money are for.<eos> That sounds so sad.<eos> Is this all worth it?<eos> I honestly don't know.<eos> But I feel like with you... it would be.
Honey, Mary Drake will never bother you again.<eos> I will make sure of that.<eos> Your father and I...<eos> Please just stop.<eos> I was thinkin' about you the other day.
No, at her parents...<eos> When they came to take her back.<eos> Did Nicole write this?<eos> "This memory of us kept me alive.<eos> I can't tell you how many nights I thought about you and our love, and I knew that I had to be strong.
- That I needed to talk to her.<eos> That I have questions and they need answers.<eos> Mary is dangerous, Spencer.<eos> - She cannot be trusted.<eos> - Oh, and you can?
I don't know what you've told her about us or what you haven't told her but she's gonna have a lot of questions in the morning.<eos> A.D. stole Emily's eggs, fertilized them and then used them to impregnate Ali.<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> Are you talking about the game?<eos> No, I'm talking about you, about the baby.
- Nono. II get it.<eos> Maybe there's some part of you that has never forgiven me for taking advantage of you and your friends for the sake of a bark.<eos> Look, Ezra, that's...<eos> I wish that I could change history but I can't.<eos> I fell in love with you, Aria.
You and your damn zoo, Scofield.<eos> I'm gonna find out once and for all what you were really doing there.<eos> What you were really planning.<eos> And then I'm gonna kill you.<eos> I know everything about you.
Thanks for everything, Holly.<eos> Look, let me just start by saying...<eos> I get why you acted the way you did at the party.<eos> I'm sorry, but for what it's worth, that guy Chase...<eos> - The way he talked about you...
She just kind of needs someone right now.<eos> Is that the guy?<eos> I wish. He hasn't been in touch.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> He really needs to be there for you.
I know, it kills me that he let this happen.<eos> Are you okay, babe?<eos> No, no, not really.<eos> I know how much it hurts when you lose something so special.<eos> I want you to know... I'm here for you.
- He tried to tell me.<eos> Yeah, he did, so why didn't you just listen to him?<eos> I mean, you believed everything I said.<eos> Even the baby.<eos> - What does that say about you?
Holly? Holly, can you hear me?<eos> Look, you're going to be okay.<eos> Don't leave me.<eos> No, I'm not going anywhere.<eos> I got you.
While I remain here, my enemies will flock to New Orleans, causing all manner of mischief.<eos> One day, most likely as a result of some fool's effort to reach me,<eos> I will escape, and I will seek my own justice.<eos> Yeah. I had a friend once, Cami.<eos> She, uh... she believed with all her heart that you had some good left in you.
Not right now, but it could be.<eos> I need to do my research.<eos> And you... need to be touched by someone who actually cares about you.<eos> Luke...<eos> I'm falling in love with you.
Travis, you have to face this.<eos> All this other stuff that you've been doing, it's not working anymore.<eos> I'll come.<eos> I'll interpret.<eos> I will be with you the whole time.
Hey, you helped somebody who desperately needed it, even though it could have cost you everything.<eos> That kind of doctor...<eos> That's the kind of doctor I want.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Just make sure you end up being the guy your Aunt Mae sees when she looks at you.
He uses the N-word a lot.<eos> "Nazi."<eos> You know, you do atrocities like kill women and children.<eos> Is that what you think of me?<eos> No, I just don't think of you. Okay.
No.<eos> It wasn't easy arranging to introduce ourselves, either.<eos> - Gina.<eos> - Doesn't matter.<eos> You don't know us. But we know a lot about you.
You don't want anything - to do with him.<eos> - I don't know. Christian, Army.<eos> - Seems pretty up front to me.<eos> - Did he happen to tell you about some of the arrests he and his brother made - at their security checkpoint?<eos> - No, focused on you.
Right.<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> Yeah, I just, uh...<eos> I came to a doctor's appointment.<eos> Being back here made me think of you.
We'll, uh... we'll give you a minute.<eos> I'm right here.<eos> I'm right here.<eos> We need to work out a way to get off this island.<eos> What I said... um, about you...
_ Hey!<eos> Hey, yo, where we headed? Marseille.<eos> - Marseilles.<eos> I own you, Scofield.<eos> I know everything about you.
He was so passionate.<eos> I thought he was some kind of preacher.<eos> So I got caught up listening.<eos> There was some people there, maybe five or six, and he was going on and on, he's saying, "He loves you.<eos> "He doesn't think about himself, He only thinks about you.
But this is all just... It's very new.<eos> This may surprise you, but you're new for me, too.<eos> Look, with Jace missing, it's just like...<eos> The ground has shifted, and I can't keep my balance.<eos> I didn't mean to take it out on you.
Let me come with you.<eos> Did you not hear me before?<eos> There's no place for you here.<eos> Let's go, Izzy.<eos> Hey, Clary, all those things Alec said about you... you know I don't feel that way.
- No, you don't.<eos> Okay, maybe I don't.<eos> I know you're obnoxious and stubborn...<eos> I hope you're going somewhere with this.<eos> But you're also loyal and honest and a big old softie when you stop worrying about what people are thinking about you.
Absolutely not.<eos> For 18 years, you've put Clary and me first.<eos> This is my cross to bear.<eos> That's not how this works.<eos> When Valentine took you, I promised myself it was the last time I'd ever be without you.
Do you love your father?<eos> I love the dream of the father I wished he'd be.<eos> The kind of father who wouldn't kill a young boy's falcon?<eos> Yes.<eos> I know more than you think about you and dear dad.
You tell her I said it was okay.<eos> She's my goddaughter.<eos> Smarter than a whip, just doesn't speak much.<eos> Anyway, enough about me.<eos> Let's talk about you.
You want to...<eos> I think so.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Alec, you care about Magnus.<eos> He cares about you.
I know.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You said you know where Izzy is?<eos> Well, not exactly.<eos> You know, I expect this from Aldertree... but not from you.
New partner?<eos> She's driving me crazy.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Uh... I w... I wanted to apologize.<eos> It was a terrible night and I took my anger out on you.
The Legion have nothing.<eos> They have Rip. We lost him, Jax.<eos> Again.<eos> But they won't have him for long.<eos> If I know one thing about you, it's that you don't give up.
Because he's innocent.<eos> The man who framed him is a 3-star general.<eos> John did not think that he would get a fair trial in the court system, which is where you come in.<eos> Oliver, I'm a city prosecutor, not a military defense attorney.<eos> That's why I thought of you.
You've been here for just few months, and already you think you know everything.<eos> Did it not occur to you that I could be playing Kovar?<eos> I... I don't believe that.<eos> Of course you don't because you don't understand that circumstances are what makes a thing poison or nectar.<eos> You believe your fool's errand to kill Kovar because you think that you are responsible for this darkness that's inside you.
You take it, and you go.<eos> I'm not abandoning my post.<eos> Suit yourself.<eos> Would you like to explain what's going on?<eos> I'd like to talk about you for a minute.
- Hey! Hey, what are you doing here?<eos> Well, Stef was with Jesus, so I thought I would come by and talk with some of his teachers.<eos> Oh, you haven't met Drew.<eos> Drew Turner, this is Lena Adams Foster.<eos> I've heard so much about you.
We're not hooking up or anything, but there's this... secret, and...<eos> I just can't face him and not tell him the truth, so I've been avoiding him.<eos> So, I...<eos> I wrote him this.<eos> It doesn't say anything about you.
I hope we're sitting together.<eos> Okay, so I found Grandma.<eos> And you need to come upstairs, like now.<eos> So are you mad at me?<eos> Not everything's about you, Callie.
But it's something.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Yeah, so...<eos> No plea deal?<eos> Well, if you can put up with all the things your family says about you, I think I can handle what some strangers at a trial say about me, so...
He didn't manipulate me.<eos> - Hear us out.<eos> - He was wrongly convicted, so...<eos> We think it's important in showing contrition to tell the court you realize now, he is guilty.<eos> That the system got it right, and you're sorry for any distress
What?<eos> For the past 10 minutes, I've seen the same orderly pass by 5 times with an empty stretcher.<eos> Could be one of Gregor's men.<eos> At any rate, they know that you are back.<eos> Or they're just here to finish the job on you.
Since when has doing the right thing been a mistake, Liza?<eos> Since you turned out to be a liar!<eos> I was all in, Quentin.<eos> You convinced me to turn myself in, turn my life around, and then one day, I'm in the TV room, and what do I see?<eos> A news report about you working for one of the worst terrorists this city has ever seen.
You knew?<eos> If you knew, then why would you train him?<eos> Why wouldn't you warn me?<eos> Two years ago, he sought me out.<eos> He'd already learned much about you.
Viktor has confirmed Gregor's location, but tell me, why did you want him gone and why are you playing Robin Hood?<eos> I met a woman.<eos> She taught me how to give my darkness an identity so that it doesn't consume me.<eos> And you believed her?<eos> Oliver, whatever you think is inside you is inside you.
Argus likes to keep tabs on interesting tech.<eos> You copied my T-sphere? No.<eos> We improved them.<eos> No. You're both wrong.<eos> Lyla, if you stole this, what other surprises can I be expecting from you?
Well, it will give us some time to talk about something, like this crazy idea that you enjoy killing.<eos> That's why you disbanded the team, isn't it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oliver, you said that I don't know the kind of man that you are.<eos> I wouldn't have fallen in love with you or wanted to marry you if I didn't know exactly the kind of man that you are.
Before he died, dad said to me, "Oliver,<eos> I am not the man you think I am."<eos> And I should've believed him.<eos> Are you ok?<eos> Are you?
Long story.<eos> Basically, we don't know what it is.<eos> All we know is, it has some kind of power to heal.<eos> You were dying.<eos> Nick used it on you.
Watch your backs. (CELL PHONE BUZZES)<eos> Oh, this was on your desk at the precinct.<eos> Adalind. I'm so happy to hear your voice.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Yeah, are you?
No, he got it out to help you.<eos> Got it out from where?<eos> Where he keeps it hidden with the cloth wrapped around it.<eos> Kind of forgot I had it.<eos> Nick left it on the bed when he got out the stick to heal you.
I went out with a couple of friends<eos> - and got a little carried away.<eos> - It's understandable.<eos> Clary told me what happened.<eos> Listen, I just want you to know, whatever's going on between you two, I'm always here for you.
I should have called.<eos> I guess I'm just... ashamed, you know?<eos> I guess I'm not as perfect as everyone thought.<eos> Trust me, I never thought you were perfect.<eos> But something is different about you.
You were just a boy.<eos> You weren't in control of your powers.<eos> Yes, actually, I was.<eos> I never wanted you to see this... terrible, ugly side of me, of my past...<eos> There's nothing ugly about you.
And eventually I ran away and... and I haven't talked to them since.<eos> The thing is... I don't think it's the anger that's keeping me from talking to them...<eos> It's because of... the guilt.<eos> I am sure your parents still love you.<eos> And they have not forgotten about you.
If you truly, truly cared about me, you would have never sent me away.<eos> I made a mistake.<eos> It was Jace that was...<eos> The sword still compels the truth.<eos> Jonathan... not a day goes by that I don't think about you. Where I am not haunted by that decision I made. To send you to Edom.
He got to me before I could even open it.<eos> That was the last time we went back to that cabin.<eos> Now I know why.<eos> Jonathan Christopher.<eos> These are about you?
Wait. Jace, this was 10 years ago.<eos> Jonathan died in a fire when he was an infant.<eos> How could Valentine still be studying him if he was already dead?<eos> Jonathan is alive.<eos> Ithuriel wasn't talking about you... he was talking about my brother.
Miller.<eos> Miller, answer me.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> You know, I have never been better.<eos> Thought we'd lost you there.
Got no place to make it in.<eos> My knife needs to be forged by my own two hands.<eos> It's a... family tradition.<eos> John, leave him be.<eos> My dearest John, my every heartbeat is ignited by the thought of you.
Mary was able to draw it out of Sebastian.<eos> How?<eos> - Could you...<eos> - One of these days John, should the Good Lord spare us, I intend to teach you proper letters.<eos> "My dearest John, my every heartbeat is ignited by the thought of you.
Nor are you.<eos> We are but servants to the newly exalted God he has fashioned himself into.<eos> I must speak to you, my lord.<eos> I've been expecting you.<eos> It's time we talked about you... and my mother.
John did it. He slew the dark angel.<eos> So you've seen him.<eos> Yes. Did he have a word for me?<eos> Of course he did.<eos> He thinks only of you.
No.<eos> No.<eos> I'm not going. Listen to me. I want you to run home as fast as you can, and not look back.<eos> Go.<eos> Go! I cannot lose you! You won't.
Your family's here.<eos> Look, we're gonna be back in it soon.<eos> I'm okay now.<eos> I am.<eos> I'm with you.
Your Grace, when I was ready to drink myself into a small coffin, Lord Varys told me about a queen in the east who...<eos> Before I came to power, you favored my brother.<eos> All your spies, your little birds, did they tell you Viserys was cruel, stupid, and weak?<eos> Would those qualities have made for a good king in your learned opinion?<eos> Until your marriage to Khal Drogo, Your Grace, I knew nothing about you, save your existence and that you were said to be beautiful.
Did you meet the big lady?<eos> - Big lady?<eos> - The lady knight?<eos> You know, I figured she was a knight 'cause she had armor on.<eos> She was looking for your sister, but I told her about you.
You know, you're not questioning any of this. I'm questioning everything right now.<eos> I'm not so young nor so narrow to assume that the dead are dead and there's no spectrum of spectral in between.<eos> In my experience, the dead that aren't rarely come back without purpose.<eos> I don't know what her purpose was.<eos> To let you go.
Lucretia Mott.<eos> Cassius...<eos> Marcellus Clay.<eos> I always have trouble pronouncing that last one, as well.<eos> I've heard so much about you and your husband from Mr. Still's letters.
Why wait 11 years to see me?<eos> That's right. 11 years.<eos> You didn't even check up on me.<eos> What can I say?<eos> I'm sorry, and you have no idea how many times I thought of you.
Would you relax?<eos> Bruce Wayne?<eos> Well, now, that changes everything.<eos> Why settle for a hundred?<eos> Perhaps I'll pay him a visit, tell him all about you.
You see, I know who I am, Professor.<eos> It's how to... be him... that is eluding me.<eos> I seek guidance.<eos> I feel your every move, I know your every thought,<eos> I'm with you from birth, and I'll see you when you rot.
Three answers.<eos> Those are the rules, Ed. Okay.<eos> Final riddle.<eos> I feel your every move, I know your every thought,<eos> I'm with you from birth, and I'll see you rot.
This is not gonna be good.<eos> - You did, didn't you?<eos> - I feel your every thought...<eos> I feel your every move, I know your every thought,<eos> I'm with you from birth, and I'll see you rot.
Where you going?<eos> To tell Alfred. Selina... Now let me go!<eos> Selina, you can't tell anyone.<eos> Then why the hell did you tell me?<eos> Because I care about you.
And for you to accept what I have to teach, you need to.<eos> Selina, wait, this city has been judged.<eos> You need to leave Gotham today.<eos> And why are you telling me?<eos> Because I care about you.
I got vengeance for my parents' murder.<eos> That's real!<eos> No.<eos> No, that's not real.<eos> What's real is every time that you were sick when you were a kid... your mum used to sit up with you all night and read to you till you fell asleep. That's real.
What do you say?<eos> - I'm in.<eos> - All right.<eos> Plunder, my man. Where do you think you're going?<eos> Right through you.
Why? You're not like the other Wellses.<eos> Yeah, so you keep reminding me.<eos> No, I mean, those two, they were geniuses.<eos> We depended on them.<eos> But with you, the roles are reversed.
Wait, where are we?<eos> I don't know.<eos> All right, well, I'm sure everybody at S.T.A.R. Labs is working on getting us out of this.<eos> Yeah, I'm glad they brought me to your Earth.<eos> Mon-El seems like he really cares about you.
Hmm. How are things going with your doomed love,<eos> Iris West?<eos> Or your greatest foe, Savitar?<eos> You know Savitar.<eos> I know everything about him, and you.
I forgot to tell you... my suit's cooler than yours.<eos> It's impossible.<eos> I don't understand. How could Savitar be you?<eos> He's not me. Not really.<eos> He's all the worst parts of you.
I forgot to tell you... my suit's cooler than yours.<eos> It's impossible.<eos> I don't understand. How could Savitar be you?<eos> He's not me. Not really.<eos> He's all the worst parts of you.
Until then, just... stay away from me.<eos> It was wrong of me to give you back the necklace.<eos> This time it really is just a symbol.<eos> Symbol or not...<eos> I never knew what it was like to want to be with someone forever till I fell in love with you.
You throw in the Caroline, and the whole âby sundowâ of it all into the mix, you really changed the rules.<eos> You think I'm being unfair.<eos> Nope.<eos> I just think you're being you.<eos> I could say the same of you.
You don't have to think about anything, just turn around. I'll meet you wherever you want.<eos> Yeah?<eos> And then what?<eos> Then, whatever anger you're working through, man, you can just take it out on me.<eos> I am taking it out on you.
I thought you had to figure things out.<eos> I did.<eos> I figured out that I'm an idiot.<eos> I'm intellectually challenged, maybe even blind.<eos> I couldn't see that everything that I was looking for was right here in you.
Yep, she's deader than a doornail.<eos> And I'll just keep coming back, again and again.<eos> You need to convince her to stop ringing this bell.<eos> You understand me?<eos> Fate of Mystic Falls lies with you
So a woman showed up to your house for sex and you barely knew her?<eos> Of course that's what happened.<eos> Guilty as charged.<eos> You want to tell me what happened last night?<eos> Jana left five minutes after you did. Alive.
What'd you do to them?<eos> Nothing.<eos> They are inconsequential.<eos> You're different.<eos> He's different when he's with you.
Wally.<eos> Hi.<eos> These are my sons. Hi.<eos> Glad to meet you. She said a lot of good things.<eos> Yeah. Right back at you, man.
I suppose you think that's funny.<eos> I know that look.<eos> Sam and Dean have got you down.<eos> Well, I still can't believe that you're working for the Dukes of Haphazard.<eos> Do you really think they care about you?
Speaking of... Now that you've heard what I have to say, places to be, vampires to behead.<eos> You got a line on vamps?<eos> I do.<eos> Interested? Damn. Sam Winchester.<eos> Rufus told me all about you.
No.<eos> Ugh.<eos> What'd you get up to?<eos> I read through more of Mick's lore books.<eos> Really? Wow. Those three stars are wasted on you.
Be a good girl.<eos> There.<eos> Really, Kel?<eos> Not taking your pills, picking at your food... refusing to bathe?<eos> Stop disrespecting the God inside of you.
And if it tells us where its family is, well, then this will all stop.<eos> Promise.<eos> That eye of yours twitches when you lie.<eos> My eye twitches all the time.<eos> Well, then, I guess I know all about you.
Hmm. This is Dean's other other cell, so you must know what to do.<eos> Hey. It's me.<eos> Sorry I couldn't pick up before. I've been on a hunt with ketch.<eos> And, Dean...<eos> I'm sorry I haven't been there for you and Sam.
Do not tell me it's powering up.<eos> It's powering up... I asked you not to tell me that.<eos> But in the opposite direction.<eos> This is amazing.<eos> As it's powering down in you, the polarity is somehow reversing.
That I'll intervene?<eos> We made it clear to each other, we don't have a relationship.<eos> We worked together.<eos> We... We know each other.<eos> I don't know you, Mary. Not really.
Not how this ends.<eos> This ends with me ending you.<eos> I'm gonna kill you.<eos> You won't, but I'd very much enjoy it if you tried.<eos> You want to know what your mother said about you, Dean?
Seriously, guys, points for trying.<eos> Super impressed, but, uh... playtime's over. ♪<eos> Get away from them.<eos> Mary, right?<eos> Yeah, I've heard about you.
- Can I...<eos> - Whatever you want. We'll be led by you.<eos> Did she tell you about the flowers? No.<eos> What flowers?<eos> Someone left her a bunch of flowers with a card saying "Thinking of you," unsigned.
- Why do it anonymously?<eos> - Well, is it against the law?<eos> You guys are gonna have your hands full come Valentine's Day.<eos> Oh, it's not illegal, but it is odd sending an unsigned card to a woman that's just been raped.<eos> What does that mean, "Thinking of you"?
Because I missed you.<eos> Because I... I blew what we had.<eos> And my life since then has been so empty.<eos> There's this... chasm... where you used to be.<eos> I just wanted to see you. Be with you.
Look.<eos> I work for Chaz at the cafe on the High street.<eos> He asked me if I wanted to help them out with this do.<eos> I spoke to one of your people about this.<eos> And did you tell them about you and Jim Atwood?
Erik and Sigefrid and Kjartan, they do what they please.<eos> You haven't asked how I come to be here.<eos> Alfred.<eos> Alfred sent us.<eos> I believe the King of Wessex... cares for you.
You!<eos> You will go to my uncle... and when he asks of his wife, you will tell him she's in the bed of Uhtred of Bebbanburg.<eos> I trust you are in health.<eos> I improve with each passing day.<eos> And you, Lord?
What did the shaman want?<eos> He asked me about you.<eos> What did you tell him?<eos> Everything.<eos> I told him everything I knew about you.
Actually, Dr. Montgomery...<eos> - Monty.<eos> - Monty...<eos> Uncle Monty, I hope, once you get used to me.<eos> Monty, our parents never mentioned you.
And what came back...<eos> Like Dan died and walked over into the land of the dead<eos> and a demon took his shape... and came back into the world amongst us.<eos> I look at your face, Petra.<eos> And for the first time ever, I see it in you.
Wait, Kyle, just let him go.<eos> Kyle.<eos> What did he do to you?<eos> I'm okay.<eos> No, he was all over you, Megan.
Pretty sure I'd do just fine.<eos> I'm leaving now.<eos> - Stay.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I want to hear all about you... hopes, dreams, the whole nine yards.
Bullshit.<eos> He'd never flip.<eos> Old Manny wouldn't, but dying's made him smaller.<eos> So let's consider now specifically the kinds of things that he might confess to.<eos> Say, vis-à-vis, you.
You make it so hard, because you don't want to believe in me.<eos> I said "believe," not "believe in."<eos> - See?<eos> - Now, listen.<eos> The onus is on you.
Why, thank you, Lucille.<eos> How about one with the two of you signing your contracts?<eos> And one more.<eos> Get the car, Mamacita.<eos> Joan, you didn't sign the contract. You know, I expected more from you, Bob, I truly did, though why I don't know.
You heard me right... tomorrow!<eos> Better get ready to be famous, Albuquerque!<eos> I can make you a TV star for a price you can afford!<eos> Call me, Saul Goodman!<eos> The world needs to know about you and your business!
We talked about this.<eos> It was a mistake.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> We didn't talk about it.<eos> I told you I knew about you and Kat, that you were sleeping with my assistant.
There wasn't a sound.<eos> He didn't cry.<eos> I just... knew.<eos> It's a blood bond that never ends, a... a closeness that can't be explained.<eos> It's how I felt about you, even when I didn't know why.
Christopher, your father's not well.<eos> Whatever he's told you about me, you can't trust.<eos> Why are you the one holding him prisoner?<eos> Okay, listen to me, this is important.<eos> All I want is to talk about you... who you are, where you've been.
You are forcing my hand.<eos> No?<eos> Nothing?<eos> You are tough.<eos> I always loved that about you.
Someday, you'll tell me how you did it.<eos> I'd ask your asset, but he'll be dead soon.<eos> It's a shame, really.<eos> There was something about him.<eos> He... he reminded me of you.
For you, anything.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Is that tension that I sense?<eos> - In the air?<eos> - In you.
Well, I'm not sure about that.<eos> They already do.<eos> What?<eos> What did you tell them?<eos> About you?
Hmm, let me see now.<eos> - You know what I mean.<eos> - They knew Cali.<eos> They adored Cali.<eos> Did I forget to tell you that your loving little sister used to brag about you, like, a lot?
And you can take that straight to the bank, because he's been there, done that.<eos> Where'd they take him?<eos> _<eos> We already met, numbnuts.<eos> We know all about you, Tomas, from Carlos Mejia.
- Langley says you set them up.<eos> - No, I didn't do that.<eos> I swear on...<eos> If they knew about the two CIA officers and the meeting place,<eos> - why didn't they know about you?
It worked?<eos> Charlie, you did it?<eos> You're right.<eos> I do feel guilty, Maggs.<eos> And that sucks 'cause I don't want to feel guilty when I'm around you.
You're right.<eos> I do feel guilty, Maggs.<eos> And that sucks 'cause I don't want to feel guilty when I'm around you.<eos> That is a terrible apology.<eos> So, I pushed this whole online-dating thing on you to make myself feel better.
I met your music teacher last night.<eos> Yeah, Ms. Grundy?<eos> They did not look like that in my day, son.<eos> Ah, what were you guys talking about?<eos> You.
I spy with my little eye Hermione Lodge, full of secrets.<eos> Riddle me this, hair models of the damned, why is Veronica's mother having a clandestine tete-a-tete with a Southside Serpent behind a dumpster at Pop's?<eos> How hard it would even be, if I've me a little heads-up?<eos> Look, I am, by nature, a conscientious objector.<eos> Not saying anything to either you or Betty, was the most moral, apathetic choice I could make.
I'll stop digging.<eos> I know it's not the drive-in, but given our circumstances...<eos> It's perfect.<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> We've always been so focused on me, my music, we never get to talk about you and your life.
I know Ms. Grundy was tutoring you.<eos> Understatement of the year.<eos> But there's this amazing songwriter from New York, who's an adjunct at Carson College?<eos> Incredible mentor.<eos> He does some coaching on the side and I told him about you.
Hold up, hold up. Look, Val.<eos> You don't sing on the bridge.<eos> Actually, the bridge is meant to be sung by two voices.<eos> What is up with you today, J?<eos> What is up with you today, Mel?
- Thanks.<eos> So will you.<eos> I know you will, Archie.<eos> Okay, so this is my mea culpa moment.<eos> I was angry at my mom and I took it out on you.
Of course you can stay.<eos> As long as you need.<eos> Anything for Alice Cooper's daughters.<eos> Thank you, Mrs. Lodge.<eos> - And thank you, Veronica.
- Thank you.<eos> Except you're bleeding me out, too, you pompous ass.<eos> You're messing with my business, my livelihood, my son's future.<eos> I don't care if you're the richest man in Riverdale.<eos> I will come after you with everything I've got.
- Where are you?<eos> Can you see us?<eos> - Yeah, yeah.<eos> - Yeah, where are you?<eos> I'm right there with you, Julie.
So why didn't you kill them when you had the chance?<eos> I was outgunned.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Should've done your reconnaissance.<eos> I did my reconnaissance on you.
This is usually a quiet and peaceful town.<eos> Looking for me?<eos> So you killed Aubrey because you found out the truth about her?<eos> You're not welcome here.<eos> 'Cause we know the truth about you.
I don't know.<eos> Are you sure? I've only known him for a few weeks. He...<eos> likes my store.<eos> He bought paint and... shower curtains for his motel.<eos> He appears to have been infatuated with you.
That's up to the judge.<eos> Personally, I wouldn't count on it.<eos> Dylan, what happened?<eos> Katie's with my dad.<eos> I'm with you, we'll figure it out.
I mean, stop me when any of this sounds normal.<eos> No.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> That I... I don't think he's ready to live back in the real world.<eos> If there's a family of cannibals in that room, I'm taking back all the nice things I said about you.
- Oh, excuse me for a moment.<eos> Holden, will you entertain our guest until I get back?<eos> Your mom's a lovely woman.<eos> You really are blessed.<eos> She told me all about you, about your brother, Luke,
Say you want to see Jacobs.<eos> The target should be holed up in apartment 2B.<eos> You aren't coming with me?<eos> The spotters will recognize my face, and they'll warn her.<eos> I'll be two minutes after you.
So how many days is that worth?<eos> Tara'.!<eos> You want me to keep it with me and always miss you.<eos> No.<eos> I want to keep that with me always so I can smile when I think of you.
Yes, Sister.<eos> It won't happen again.<eos> Sister Winifred, would you be so kind as to pass the custard?<eos> My mother is nothing like Mrs Chen, I promise.<eos> She's going to adore you.
Sorry.<eos> Ladies, may I introduce Nurse Valerie Dyer, our latest recruit.<eos> - Welcome! - Hello.<eos> Shall we do our level best to convince her that we operate like a well-oiled machine?<eos> We've heard a lot about you.
- Go!<eos> Your sister would make a lovely nurse.<eos> So this is normal? To go to the hospital?<eos> Every case is different.<eos> I'll be there with you.
I'm not withdrawing. For the good of the country.<eos> Remember what you so generously handed me the night that Frankie was shot, what you called the most beautiful thing in the world?<eos> America?<eos> I'm keeping it.<eos> It's not safe with you.
Look, we're out of options.<eos> There's no time to vet anyone else!<eos> Maybe we don't have to. What?<eos> Maybe we don't have to vet anyone else because maybe I already know all there is to know about the man that I want as my Vice President.<eos> It's you, Cyrus.
You sound well.<eos> All right. Looking forward to it.<eos> Talk soon. Okay, bye.<eos> I was just about to call you.<eos> Oh, just to say hi, and, uh... tell you I'm thinking about you, and, uh". And to say I'm sorry about earlier. I...
♪ Must be love ♪<eos> ♪ Love, love ♪<eos> ♪ It must be love ♪<eos> ♪ Love, love. ♪<eos> I'm sorry, I can't stop thinking about you.
I'm still pinching myself.<eos> You were a rookie beat cop when we got married.<eos> Jim, you were determined always to become what you saw as the best version of yourself, to become someone that your family, your sons could look up to and admire.<eos> It's not easy being married to a stubborn man.<eos> I'm talking about you.
I broke my father's heart.<eos> I forfeited the right to claim his sword.<eos> It's yours.<eos> May it serve you well.<eos> And your children after you.
That's what I saw in the fire.<eos> A mountain like an arrow head.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> We're getting close.<eos> Do you know what I like about you?
It's interesting, these heroes you name...<eos> Drogo, Jorah,<eos> Daario, even this...<eos> Jon Snow...<eos> They all fell in love with you.
Always has been.<eos> I don't follow.<eos> We don't need to look for some new virus that Arias is infecting people with.<eos> The virus is lying dormant inside of everyone.<eos> Even you.
Face the entrance.<eos> - Karolina. - Hm? If you don't mind, may I sit facing the entrance?<eos> I prefer the way the light radiates off you from that angle.<eos> Charming, as always.<eos> Not so difficult around you.
Canyons.<eos> Desert.<eos> You know how it is when you take a drive like that. And everything that's not important just falls away.<eos> Sounds like just what you needed.<eos> I thought about you a lot.
Come with me.<eos> All right.<eos> This is gonna be great on you.<eos> Yeah. That does look good.<eos> Well, we have to look very hard to find something. That wouldn't look good on you.
All right, then.<eos> Let's roll camera.<eos> Look right on you! Come on!<eos> Look at her!<eos> How's she making you feel?
- Okay, I'm late.<eos> Can we talk about this later?<eos> Not really.<eos> So when it says in Isiah,<eos> "You will keep in perfect peace those whose minds are steadfast because they trust in you," who is he talking about?
And I looked down and I saw Natchez, Mississippi, my whole life really, and it fit between these two fingers.<eos> No wonder doing the video scared you.<eos> You scared me.<eos> Maybe you scared yourself.<eos> I just know I saw something in you, something raw and real.
I know this is so difficult, right now.<eos> I just want you to know that I love you, And that I'm here for you.<eos> I love you too.<eos> I know that we haven't got to see each other a lot.<eos> But my memories of you and your sister are the only thing that kept me sane While I've been... While I've been gone.
I didn't think you'd come.<eos> Well, I thought that's what you wanted.<eos> I didn't really know what I wanted.<eos> It's really good to see you.<eos> I've been thinking about you so much.
So I tell my brain not to think of her, and somehow that makes me think of her way more.<eos> I did exactly the same thing when I lost my mama.<eos> I tried so hard not to think about her.<eos> And eventually... I realized that sometimes the best medicine is to go ahead and think about her all you want.<eos> Reflect on her and all the good... and... you realize that all of that good is still... right there inside of you.
Not at all.<eos> What I mean is that every time I've stumbled in my career, your mom was there to pick me up even when I didn't deserve it.<eos> And I never got the chance to properly thank her.<eos> Maybe now I can.<eos> I just see so much potential in you.
The highs are so high.<eos> The lows are so low.<eos> I think I know what you're talking about.<eos> Tell me about that stunning performance on the music video.<eos> Honestly, it's kind of terrifying when... somebody sees something in you you didn't even know existed.
Oh, then don't talk to me about Johnny Cash.<eos> I knew him.<eos> He was an amazing human being.<eos> Okay, everybody out!<eos> Looks good on you.
I signed your cast.<eos> You got a real pretty name.<eos> Nadine, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Must be something about you, because I'm terrible with names.
And, secondly, pretty goes away.<eos> In the end, it doesn't mean a damn thing.<eos> Yeah, but it's easy for you to say.<eos> I mean, you don't have people calling you horrible names every day for the way you look.<eos> - When I listen to your music and I read about you and Gunnar, it allows me to not have to be myself for a minute.
- You're just trying to... embarrass me now or something, right?<eos> It's true.<eos> Speaking of which, how did your meeting go with Jessie Caine?<eos> Speaking of what?<eos> Women who have crushes on you?
- Jessie?<eos> It's Deacon.<eos> - Hi.<eos> I got a call from this manager, Hank Morris.<eos> Wanted the scoop on you.
Are you done looking at the room?<eos> Yeah... Yeah, I'm done.<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah, why?<eos> I just didn't think I'd hear from you. Unless something bad happened or there was an emergency.

Where am I?<eos> You're in my home.<eos> You're my guest.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I've heard so much about you. I feel as if we already know one another.
Surprise.<eos> Okay, what is happening here?<eos> We're back together.<eos> Well, it's... it's really great to finally meet you, Vik.<eos> We've heard so much about you.
Everyone else assumes that life is a given.<eos> But you and I both know that it's not.<eos> You and I both know that breath can end.<eos> So we know that life is a gift.<eos> You'll miss Dawn, but you'll keep her with you.
And so am I.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Hey, can I ask you something?<eos> Okay.<eos> Who was he with you?
You know, he seemed like a man that could take care of things.<eos> That's not how you saw him?<eos> I found him to be so insecure.<eos> I mean, obviously very intelligent, but I always was after him to hustle more, call his publisher, or stand up to my father.<eos> It's like he was a completely different person with you.
I went up to Woodlawn.<eos> To talk to your doctor.<eos> Dr. Parry, right, that's her name?<eos> Yeah.<eos> To talk about you.
- We're family.<eos> - Yeah, exactly. But I'm your wife, Jake.<eos> I am your family now.<eos> We are a team. I want to know you.<eos> I want to know everything about you.
The last thing he ever said to me was that I was pathetic.<eos> That my life was useless.<eos> He never had any time for me.<eos> And I don't see how his death changes anything.<eos> Richard, you know how I feel about you.
So, all hands on deck, as it were.<eos> You're working late.<eos> I'm clearing out my things.<eos> Emma, don't.<eos> I know I've been stupid and made mistakes and I'm not asking you to forgive me, but when I think of this place it's not my family, my father... it's you.
Hey, everybody.<eos> Hey, candy.<eos> Y'all stupid.<eos> It smells in here, like y'all been working out.<eos> Shit, I'm about to work you out.
Some mornings, right when I wake up, I realize I'm thinking about Jake and I remember.<eos> - You lied to me?<eos> - I was trying to protect you.<eos> You may have ruined my one chance at reconnecting with my mother.<eos> When I woke up this morning, I was thinking about you.
Isn't this spectacular, Cassie?<eos> Just think, right here in Middleton we have something that is almost certainly one-of-a-kind!<eos> These flowers are beautiful.<eos> Thank you, Sam.<eos> I just wanted you to know I was thinking about you.
Yeah, that is a great way to remember it.<eos> It's 'cause I've got the best teacher in town.<eos> Well, thanks for all the learning.<eos> I'll try to remember to thank you during my graduation speech.<eos> Oh no, no, you'd better, since I'll be the one speaking right after you're done.
What about after?<eos> When Snyder finds that key card missing, I'm the first one he'll throw in solitary.<eos> Haven't you ever wanted to be a part of something bigger than yourself?<eos> This is your chance.<eos> I saw something in you.
Like I said, they're sisters.<eos> How often does your wife go visit Ms. Kenner in the Green Zone?<eos> What's with all the questions?<eos> I just want to get to know the Bowman family a little bit better.<eos> Let's talk about you, Bob.
I made those promises because I misplaced my trust in you.<eos> Are you gonna tell them that?<eos> Helena, you can't fire me.<eos> Not after you swore that I was your savior.<eos> It'll blow back on you.
He's on his way to San Antone, to cornhole your mother, the whore.<eos> You know who I am?<eos> You're the...<eos> Yeah.<eos> I've heard about you.
You've read some papers. Some file a prison hack too stupid to make it on the outside wrote about me after he showed me some inkblots.<eos> You read that shit and think you're inside my head?<eos> Doc, you don't know a fucking thing about me.<eos> - You're right, Jack.<eos> I don't know a fucking thing about you.
Wrote the numbers down exactly the way he told me.<eos> - Pressure changes things.<eos> Makes a man write a six instead of a nine.<eos> - Not Beeker, the man's ice.<eos> - I was talking about you.
Why do you ask?<eos> I'm just trying to build up a picture.<eos> - And have you spoken to Susan?<eos> - Of course.<eos> I haven't mentioned you.
Okay, okay.<eos> Nick, I'm leaving Portland in four hours.<eos> - Where? - I'll know when I get there.<eos> - What about me?<eos> - Didn't say anything about you.
This is the best day of my life.<eos> Honey, I'm...<eos> I'm concerned.<eos> Paul, auggie's back. We have nothing to worry about.<eos> No, I'm talking about you.
- I voted for you.<eos> Why'd you quit?<eos> - It wasn't me.<eos> - Looked like you.<eos> You're telling me someone used Verfluchte Zwillingsschwester on you?
Tell us what happened here.<eos> Okay, I... I found Dev on the ground, and he was covered in plants and stuff, and then I...<eos> I tried to help him, and this stem... it just came right through his chest.<eos> And there was blood everywhere, and... that's what killed him, okay?<eos> I watched him die. Is that Dev's blood on you?
- And remember, we do deliver.<eos> - I know.<eos> Getting old is no fun.<eos> Then I guess we're not having any fun, 'cause we're getting old together.<eos> "But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you, and loved the sorrows of your changing face."
I have no idea, but it's... it's definitely a last-resort kind of potion.<eos> Maybe it's just what we need to defeat this evil bastard.<eos> Well, we're gonna have to ask Adalind, because my blood won't work anymore.<eos> I'll text Nick.<eos> Dude... we are taking you down.
You can.<eos> With the Strength of One's Blood.<eos> - We tried that.<eos> - You didn't.<eos> The strength of your blood, the blood of your Grimm ancestors, all of us... it's inside you.
I believe that you are the man to lead this revolution.<eos> If elected, you will serve our borough in parliament.<eos> And I'd be expected to vote as you directed.<eos> Since you and I think along similar lines... it can surely be no hardship to vote likewise?<eos> Truly, I believe that if you and I walked into a room, all the men would look at me, but within five minutes they'd all be clustered around you.
His outburst wasn't about you.<eos> You can believe whatever you want, but Harvey lashed out at me, and now he's not even man enough to come to me to ask me for help himself?<eos> Why should I even lift a finger to help him?<eos> Because he went to go make things right with his mother.<eos> And he did it because of how he felt after he lashed out at you.
Or to yourself.<eos> In my position, I am constantly surrounded by those who would seek to deceive me.<eos> It would pain me to think that you are no different.<eos> James, I would never deceive you, but I cannot.<eos> You invited me here because you think of me as often as I think of you.
Plenty of arranged marriages do.<eos> And plenty don't.<eos> Two random people forced to spend the rest of their lives together?<eos> You don't even know who I am, what I like... who I love.<eos> No, but I have heard about you.
The Crown Matrimonial.<eos> Oh, how romantic.<eos> Your thoughts are already of your life without me after I am dead.<eos> Not at all.<eos> I'm thinking of you.
If I want to challenge Elizabeth and survive,<eos> - But what is survival without even the hope of love?<eos> - My people...<eos> - I'm not talking about your subjects.<eos> I'm talking about you.
"for Tucker, I'll leave a list" of all the guys I've had really great sex with so he can be jealous for all eternity...<eos> "Greg, Houston, Cody h., Cody d."<eos> Cody d.?<eos> Well it was just anal so I'll still get into heaven.<eos> The part about you is at the end.
- he just never stopped lying.<eos> - Always.<eos> Managers get used to lying, but Sandy took it to an art form.<eos> Where am I?<eos> I'm in Joel Silver's office right now, talking about you.

Hey, no, that's natural.<eos> Are you a man, Sandy?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I was bar mitzvahed, but that was a long time ago.<eos> - You know what I love about you? - Yeah?
It's suicide.<eos> It's Mike Ross' case, it's his call.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> Mike Ross is some clinic worker.<eos> You're Harvey Specter. And from what I hear about you, you don't give a shit about guilt.
- You piece of shit.<eos> - Please, my employees are gonna lose their jobs because of me.<eos> We need to keep this suit going and get that technology back.<eos> Nuh-uh, buddy.<eos> You don't give a shit about your employees and I don't give a shit about you.
Andy, where we had our first date.<eos> That is so thoughtful.<eos> Um... I've been doing a lot of thinking lately.<eos> Really?<eos> About... About you.
What game are you running?<eos> Do you think that I'm gonna send Jimmy pictures of you for 15 years to run a con?<eos> I thought he was your dad.<eos> Do you want to tell him or should I?<eos> Well, Erin. He... He really cares about you.
I knew you'd come.<eos> Are you hurt?<eos> You know what they're going to do to me?<eos> It's the sound of the blade that I fear the most.<eos> I shut my eyes and think of you when you were a child, my love.
That's delightful.<eos> I need your sash and your gown.<eos> So that I can press it.<eos> I don't want anyone looking wrinkly.<eos> I don't mean you, but it's fun that you're right there.
Dr. Reese will do a neurosurgery consult with you, and then our head of neurosurgery, dr. Abrams, will come down and go over the details.<eos> I'm so sorry, bria.<eos> Stop it.<eos> It's not your fault.<eos> No. I wasn't thinking about you.
Okay, you hang in there, guys.<eos> I'm gonna give you something to make you feel better, all right?<eos> Place two 16-gauges on the right, and let them know he's red-tagged.<eos> Jeff, stay with the kids.<eos> I got you!
Do you know what this means?<eos> It means we're going to Russia.<eos> ♪♪<eos> The superior:<eos> It's good to see there's still some fight left in you.
You are Phil Coulson, agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., and your subconscious knows that!<eos> You need to go.<eos> You need to remember me!<eos> And Fitz and Agent May and all the good that we have done!<eos> Your friends depend on you, and this world is a lie!
- Engine?<eos> - Twin cam, 88.<eos> Ooh! That's my girl.<eos> Keep your head down. Do what they say.<eos> I'm right here with you.
I hope not.<eos> Thank you, gentlemen.<eos> Why are you doing this, Fitz?<eos> It's Dr. Fitz.<eos> And unlike the men who just left, I know the truth about you, your world.
Is that true?<eos> Can you destroy her?<eos> Maybe.<eos> But it's like Daisy said, she won't let me anywhere near her.<eos> This thing in you ... is it as desperate to destroy Aida as we are?
- Okay, it's now or never.<eos> Time's running out.<eos> That door is the only way out.<eos> Please, Mack.<eos> Everyone who cares about you is on the other side of that door.
- The gateway's almost ready.<eos> - Don't need it.<eos> I've learned a few things since you saw me last.<eos> I don't envy you.<eos> I was gonna say the same to you.
- You must be the new partner.<eos> - I am.<eos> Spencer Strasmore, meet Wayne Hastings Jr., the one and only.<eos> Ah, Wayne, it's a pleasure to meet you.<eos> You know, Mr. Anderson says great things about you.
It just got tough for you?<eos> It's not for me.<eos> This is for you.<eos> Come on.<eos> There are naked photographs of your girlfriend taken by another guy, and everything people are saying about them and me... it all reflects back to you.
No...<eos> I... If... If I'd known that Aaron was inside there...<eos> How can you... torture me with those lies?<eos> I wish they were lies.<eos> I stood by you when nobody else would.
- I killed my husband, Kyle.<eos> He bled out on the bathroom floor, and I just watched him die.<eos> Did nothing to help.<eos> I don't even know why.<eos> There was something... inside of you.
Kyle Barnes isn't here to save you.<eos> Jason, listen to me.<eos> Listen to me, it's not too late.<eos> You need to fight this thing inside of you.<eos> Come on, fight it inside of you.
Do you know why it's unethical for a therapist to go out with her client, Harvey?<eos> Yeah, of course I do.<eos> It's because it's natural for a client to transfer feelings of desire onto his therapist that aren't real.<eos> - I know that.<eos> You don't think I've had fantasies about you?
- And you never came back.<eos> - I want to talk to you for a minute.<eos> - About what? - I know you went to Harvey and you made him promise to pull the plug on my getting into the bar if things got too risky.<eos> - He wasn't supposed to tell you that.<eos> - Did you really think he wouldn't? - Mike, I only made him promise because I care about you.
- hide anything from you. - Well, maybe you should - hide some things from me.<eos> - What?<eos> You heard me.<eos> - I heard you.<eos> How dare you say that to me after what I had to find out about you.
So that's all this is?<eos> What? You sell the world a story and you get rich by exploiting people's pain and loss?<eos> I may not believe in heaven... but I do believe in money.<eos> What were you thinking, coming back here?<eos> I was thinking of you.
Why?<eos> You're gonna talk to me?<eos> Talk to me.<eos> Talk... Talk to me, Nick.<eos> I don't know anything about you, you know.
Wynonna.<eos> - What?<eos> - Wynonna Earp, though?<eos> Weird.<eos> He never mentioned you. OK, well...
Now, my boys have already started.<eos> So back off and let us get on with it.<eos> All right.<eos> Untwist your knickers, Clifford.<eos> I've got people on the outside relying on you, so stop messing about and get it done.
If you jump, they'll say you did it.<eos> I didn't!<eos> I'd never hurt her.<eos> But you were her boyfriend and you never came forward.<eos> David, I know about you and Julie-Ann.
It's just...<eos> It's just what?<eos> You don't want to spend the rest of your life in uniform, like me?<eos> - You'll put in a word for me?<eos> - Look, you're on top brass's radar, and CID have nothing but good things to say about you, so just bide your time, be patient.
No hideous puffy coats.<eos> No pants.<eos> And no flat-ass fucking hair.<eos> I mean, Jesus H...<eos> Yeah, I'm talking to you, tits-on-a-stick Stacey.
- It's not his fault. - And yet I watched him strike down Sir Galahad with my own eyes.<eos> You have to believe that your husband can be saved, or else he will be truly lost.<eos> Unless we stop the Black Knight's army, we may never find out.<eos> My Queen, you must be strong.<eos> With King Arthur missing, the Knights of the Round Table will look to you to lead them.
All right, I'll just be a minute.<eos> I gotta recalibrate the time drive.<eos> You okay?<eos> I was reminded... that partners must believe in one another.<eos> You know I have the utmost faith and trust in you, Jefferson.
I liked you better when you were killing people.<eos> Ah, I see that not everything has changed in my absence.<eos> Ms. Jiwe, I had the honor of serving alongside your compatriots, including Dr. Heywood's grandfather.<eos> They all spoke very highly of you.<eos> Well, this group speaks very highly of you too.
- The name is Livewire.<eos> Do you know what power is, Freud?<eos> About time they hired more people.<eos> It's the feeling of someone's life in your hands.<eos> Every atom in you, it just burns electric.
You okay?<eos> He's not doing it.<eos> Don't let the fear in.<eos> Remember the strength of your people.<eos> That strength lives inside you.
What did he do?<eos> Did he look at other women the entire night?<eos> No.<eos> Oh, did he chew with his mouth open and tell those inappropriate jokes?<eos> No, all he did was talk about you the entire date.
- Are you okay?<eos> - Don't.<eos> You're still angry I had Metallo liberate you from that jail?<eos> It makes me look more guilty when I'm not.<eos> Even if they found out the truth about you, no one would change their mind.
I didn't see you there, tall, dark and bland-some.<eos> You're barely there, let alone my romantic rival.<eos> No!<eos> What...<eos> Invisible is a good look on you.
I told you a lot of things.<eos> He's as good as dead now, thanks to you and your friends.<eos> If I'd known your brother was in danger, I would have helped you.<eos> Why would you help me?<eos> Because I care about you.
And no.<eos> We're not going to your secret planet.<eos> I'm Supergirl, I don't run from anything.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> It's one of the more annoying things about you.
I have an idea.<eos> Ion thrusters are ready and the navigation system is set for Daxam.<eos> Take us out.<eos> You just don't know when to let go, do you?<eos> I was gonna say the same thing about you.
- Yeah.<eos> - The nano swarm, it migrates.<eos> - Yes. - It's linked ai sentience.<eos> And it's all controlled through the spheerical lab mainframe.<eos> And I would never have gotten there if I hadn't been thinking about you.
Because I'm black?<eos> You look the same as he does too.<eos> - Why don't you talk to him?<eos> - It's more than that.<eos> He sees something in you.
Pretty savvy if you ask me.<eos> You've learned a lot of things about this world, Mother.<eos> I've had to.<eos> And did you learn that we're not bulletproof here?<eos> James! You just have to look inside of yourself and see the strength and the courage that I see in you.
Come on. - Let's do this. - You're in the right place.<eos> You're in the right place messing with us. Yes.<eos> Jay White, I'd like to introduce you to the man himself, my brother Ray Donovan.<eos> Respect, man.<eos> I heard a lot about you.
Although I don't appreciate you looking at me like some kind of a pathetic dog you see in a shelter.<eos> Get out of the stock, Chuck, any way you can.<eos> - They're gonna crush you.<eos> Wow, I'm glad to see you view me as so defenseless.<eos> I think enough of you to come here and violate my agreement with my company.
Rhoades?<eos> You didn't think this shit happened by accident, did you, Mr. Dake?<eos> So, you leveraged the Attorney General into my appointment.<eos> It was no arm twist.<eos> I just told her that smarts and ambition were coming off you like heat waves from an Oklahoma blacktop.
You are so charming.<eos> Like I said, versatile. Yeah.<eos> Isn't he so charming?<eos> Great. Okay, well, now I know what I'm wearing to the Ivy tonight.<eos> Let's talk about you, and by you, I mean your ex.
We can wait to share the gory details.<eos> Well, someone must have disparaged me.<eos> - Perhaps that crone, Mary...<eos> - Stop.<eos> I've spent five years protecting her from everything, including all the horror stories floating around about you.
You're all cut up.<eos> Why aren't you healing?<eos> You know, I never really bought into that whole wolf pack mentality.<eos> I thought there was something wrong with me.<eos> But I'm a model citizen compared to you.
You were a Mikaelson.<eos> You did what you had to do.<eos> The truth is, I'd... do it all again.<eos> I told myself a hundred times that it was all for Hope, but maybe I did it for selfish reasons, too.<eos> When I wasn't with my daughter, all I thought about was you.
You are good.<eos> No, you are good.<eos> I was wrong when I said that you were a Mikaelson. You're not a Mikaelson.<eos> You don't have a Mikaelson heart.<eos> There's just too muchmuood in you.
It wants me here?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> It is that thing, the thing that resides within this city.<eos> Within all of us.<eos> It is in you.
If this is indeed a trap, if Marcel is intent on killing us... your daughter needs a father.<eos> We're all going.<eos> She needs me, I need both of you.<eos> We're family, we stick together.<eos> What lives in me lives in you.
If I thought I couldn't do this, I wouldn't have come.<eos> Niklaus, when this is done, I want you to take Hayley and Hope away from this.<eos> All of it.<eos> You've pointedly left yourself out of that equation.<eos> Whatever Hayley saw in you, she will come to accept.
Still, after all that, here I am.<eos> Here you are.<eos> Hiding inside the body of a vampire, because you're not as strong as you want me to think.<eos> You always had such spine.<eos> It's what I enjoyed most about you.
I never thought I'd live to see this day.<eos> See, growing up in New Orleans as kids, we-we hear stories about the evil Klaus Mikaelson.<eos> Yes, yes, and now I'll finally reap my just desserts.<eos> No.<eos> I was gonna say, here you are, finally living up to the potential that Cami saw in you.
Sing it, Effie!<eos> - Yo, you just hit 10,000 views!<eos> - No shit!<eos> Let me see this.<eos> All these comments are about you, though.
You need to lay low.<eos> Stay out of the game for a while.<eos> Shit's bad timing, Proctor.<eos> I'm under pressure to... keep doing what I'm doing.<eos> Yeah, well, Angela knows everything about you.
Yes...<eos> So, if he's her father, and she was preserved 70 years ago...<eos> You...!<eos> No flies on you, Bill.<eos> And no bugs in you.
I was your stalking horse.<eos> You did the transaction.<eos> You left the opening.<eos> It's funny.<eos> I was just about to say the same thing to you.
You can put the blankets... put 'em over there.<eos> You must be Sidney.<eos> I thought you were gonna bring the cots in?<eos> Well, I wanted to make sure this is where you wanted them before I started hauling them all in.<eos> Sidney, Evelyn has told me about you.
From the size and shape, I think we're looking at the murder weapon.<eos> The Dagger of Z'urn D'oragh.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> No, no, don't touch.<eos> One cut and you're toast.
And we're gonna start at the beginning, and please keep in mind what happens to people who lie to me.<eos> Okay.<eos> You listening?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I found out about you from my partner, Ryder.
All right, you continue painting and I'll go back to not assuming - that everyone has a conscience. - Mmm-hmm.<eos> It is prison, after all.<eos> You nerds going to Eddy's thing Saturday?<eos> - Ugh. I hate reggaeton.<eos> - Shit, Daya, you got any Puerto Rican in you?
I kill at trivia night.<eos> In Connecticut.<eos> Specifically in Connecticut.<eos> Fuck, would you look at me?<eos> I'm all giggly and gay for you.
Just pretend it's corn.<eos> It's a very long story.<eos> You have taught me... that... love hurts.<eos> You've taught me that life... It hurts.<eos> And I want to be there for you. I want us to be there for each other.
I had that coming in.<eos> It's over.<eos> Underwood's gonna lose tomorrow.<eos> He's done.<eos> And when he's done, you're done.
Ah, you listen to the voices in your head.<eos> Some people think that you're crazy.<eos> The more they say it, the more you believe it, and you find yourself in a dark place where no words can help you.<eos> If you couldn't handle everything, what makes you think I can?<eos> Well, you've been dealing with this your whole life... people talking about you, putting you down,
- We will find Koen, overpower him.<eos> - It's too late.<eos> You've been distracted, unfocused, keeping things from me.<eos> Let's talk about deception, Waruu.<eos> When were you going to tell me the Hairy essence works in you?
Am I... Oh, I didn't...<eos> I didn't hear the beep. Ruth. Hi, it's Mallory.<eos> There's an audition.<eos> I'm not running it.<eos> They're looking for unconventional women, whatever the hell that means, and I thought of you.
I'm talking couple of hundred grand?<eos> I give you the route, you figure out the best place to hit the truck.<eos> "Hit the truck"?<eos> And what makes you think we'd be stupid enough to rob Sonny Castillo?<eos> Maybe the rumors about you are right.
I'll leave you and your buddy to your search, then.<eos> Hey, Nate?<eos> Tell your mom hi for me, will you?<eos> What did you do this time, Dad?<eos> You know, I was dating Jay four months before he finally cornered me and asked me to tell him just one story about you that doesn't end with,
Yeah.<eos> And that cocky little jerk nearly pissed himself.<eos> Yeah, and you stayed by the fence the whole game, daring Coach to take me out.<eos> You know, when there's not a straight line to something, you always find another way.<eos> It's the one thing I like about you.
Had some lean years, but now that we got Céspedes, everybody wants on the bandwagon.<eos> I'll stop you there.<eos> I ain't your buddy, and there sure as hell ain't no "we,"<eos> so ask what you want about Donnie Pomp, and let's get this over with.<eos> I'd rather talk about you.
Everybody has their limit.<eos> We're under a lot of pressure right now, and I just want to make sure we don't have any cracks.<eos> I'm solid.<eos> Like I've always been.<eos> Can the same be said about you?
Well, it's the right tool for the job.<eos> I asked you to stay away, and you decide to come back.<eos> No, you asked me to go someplace safe.<eos> Yeah, but not here, not now.<eos> Turns out, despite everything, I only feel safe when I'm with you.
I'm sorry. He's a good egg.<eos> But the fact that you're here in the wee hours of the morning makes me all that much more curious.<eos> We're tracking down leads for who might have tried to kill us.<eos> Or you're here to further intimidate a false arrest more than you already have.<eos> You know, your man Quince told me a sordid tale about you, a goodie bag full of narcotics, and one nasty frame job.
Now every time I cook breakfast in that kitchen, I see his face.<eos> I feel his breath on my neck.<eos> And every lie I have to tell... no matter how much it costs me,<eos> no matter how much it kills me inside, if I can be telling the truth when I tell my daughter that she is safe...<eos> Every little bit of hope that I have... is here with you.
I feel his breath on my neck.<eos> And every lie I have to tell... no matter how much it costs me,<eos> no matter how much it kills me inside, if I can be telling the truth when I tell my daughter that she is safe...<eos> Every little bit of hope that I have... is here with you.<eos> My future... is here with you...
Especially a trial where someone plants a bomb inside your stomach.<eos> Wait. What?<eos> Do we know where these people are... who they are, even?<eos> No.<eos> Even if we did, how do you defuse a bomb that's... inside you?
I've cheated, I...<eos> I've killed for you.<eos> No, not for me.<eos> For Elena maybe, but she's long gone.<eos> You don't know me... and I sure as hell don't know you, Ben.
Across from the couch, there's a window you keep open mostly at night, not 15 feet from your boy's bedroom, up the hall on the right.<eos> And your girl's just after that.<eos> And yours, Byrde, is at the very end.<eos> Your toothbrush is blue.<eos> We know all about you, Martin.
A lot of accidents happen on the lake.<eos> Look for opportunity.<eos> Find the scenario you can control... and you do what nature intended.<eos> Hey. You'll be fine, Ruthie.<eos> You got me inside you.
If you knew, why didn't you confront me?<eos> And what would I say? Anything!<eos> Anything at all.<eos> Instead of pushing all of those emotions down, distancing yourself - from anything you feel. - Hang on...<eos> Do not change the subject to me 'cause we're talking about you.
Instead of pushing all of those emotions down, distancing yourself - from anything you feel. - Hang on...<eos> Do not change the subject to me 'cause we're talking about you.<eos> - We're talking about that.<eos> - You have walled me out!<eos> - Wendy, we're talking about you...
I have to say the words to open the trap.<eos> Of my own volition.<eos> Out loud.<eos> And I'm not going to do that because there is one policy for you out here, and it is to box you up for eternity.<eos> I'm kind of boxed up right now, in you.
My way is best way.<eos> But you can abort it, right?<eos> This is exorcism.<eos> That thing is not human.<eos> The longer it's inside you, the more tangled it gets with your essence and the harder it is for me to help you, you understand?
Our mission is to keep Roan on the throne, to buy time for the others to find a way to save us from the radiation.<eos> I'm doing that.<eos> By decapitating an innocent boy.<eos> Everyone's guilty of something.<eos> There's a darkness in you, Octavia.
So, what, I survive long enough for everyone else to die?<eos> I can't do that, Abby.<eos> Even if it costs me my life... you have to let me go.<eos> Abby, wait. Why haven't you had any symptoms?<eos> They used the EMP on you, too.
When I win, I'm gonna eat you like a ripe mango.<eos> If our relationship's going to last, we need common interests.<eos> We've got common interests.<eos> Focus on the game, baby.<eos> My dad used to tell me stories about you when I was a kid.
- Not far.<eos> Nas Stone?<eos> You guys ballers or gangsters?<eos> Well, we ain't ballers.<eos> I'm hearing good things from Saul Gold about you.
I was gulping for air that never came.<eos> You know, graceless.<eos> Until I let go.<eos> But I'm not talking about me right now.<eos> I'm talking about you.
- No offense, Q, I didn't actually ask your opinion.<eos> Thanks, though.<eos> - Julia, wait.<eos> - Hi, Julia.<eos> You thought I'd forgotten about you?
"No, don't go.<eos> Please."<eos> - Alice, what did you do? - Nothing.<eos> I can't do magic, remember?<eos> I'm stuck inside you.
Seni Baglamak.<eos> I bind you!<eos> Silly boy.<eos> I can't be boxed.<eos> - I read about you.
I'm relieved. Your mother was worried sick.<eos> Yeah, that's what she said.<eos> May I speak to her?<eos> She's busy right now.<eos> I just wanted you to know that... she's been thinking about you.
Come on, I'm serious.<eos> You can stay in mom's old room.<eos> I'll even, I don't know, buy new sheets or whatever it is you want me to do.<eos> No.<eos> I can't be around you. What?
Now, he needs mentoring, but when the time comes, whoever gets him is going to have a bright future.<eos> You're sick.<eos> That's what makes me the motivated leader I am today.<eos> Now, why don't you run along and help facilitate a smooth transition?<eos> I was just thinking about you.
That boy was the best chance we had of beating this thing.<eos> Now, I guess we wait.<eos> Just... sit back and let it happen?<eos> Baby, I tried.<eos> I tried to focus on you.
I know he and Byron had words... a few days ago.<eos> Peter and I are taking a break.<eos> I hadn't heard, I'm sorry.<eos> I guess it can't be easy living with something like that.<eos> I mean, living with that thing inside you.
Your name!<eos> - Hey, what's going on in there?<eos> - Hey, Amy.<eos> Uh, how's it going?<eos> - Fine, robby, and you?
Lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil.<eos> - Stop!<eos> Stop!<eos> - Save your children who trust in you, my god.<eos> Let him find in you lord, a fortified tower.
So trust me now.<eos> It's okay. It's okay.<eos> Why can't I remember you?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But you said that Yoki helped you escape the clinic. So she wants to help you.
With no Arkyn plasma, there's no reason for war.<eos> - We picked a fight.<eos> - Oh, I see.<eos> The little puppy nipped at the big dog, and now it wants to hide behind its owners legs.<eos> I think he's talking about you.
Kendry, welcome to my war room.<eos> It's impressive.<eos> I'm so pleased you survived the transfusion.<eos> I upgraded you from whatever gutter green<eos> - that was inside of you.
That doesn't prove anything.<eos> - Trina.<eos> - What?<eos> That was the name of the first girl you ever kissed.<eos> Her brother Draydon was in love with you.
I don't know...<eos> I'm just...<eos> A kid?<eos> Don't bother.<eos> The Emperor told me all about you.
They hired Dr. Shaw to work on a top secret cutting-edge project, the creation of a new stage in human evolution.<eos> An advanced bio-synthetic organism. You.<eos> She helped oversee the first phase of your development, your genesis, and your awakening.<eos> Though unlike the rest of her team, Dr. Shaw saw you as more than Dwarf Star property.<eos> She recognized the humanity in you, and she tried to reach out to it, but when her superiors found out, she was removed from the project.
No, what do you think?<eos> - Do you like it?<eos> - The disodium phosphate tickles my synthetic receptors.<eos> My awkwardness amuses you.<eos> It's what I like about you.
My feelings are undamaged.<eos> You tend to speak your mind without the thought of consequence.<eos> - I know.<eos> - We have that in common.<eos> It's one of the things I like about you.
I've missed this side of you.<eos> Yeah, well, it's been a rough month. Yeah.<eos> You know, you may think you call the shots, but we all do.<eos> We all have a say in where we go, what we do.<eos> It's not all on you.
Hyadum12, The General, the rebels, they're not your problem anymore.<eos> The General made me complicit in the murder of thousands of innocent civilians.<eos> Don't let your desire for revenge destroy the two best things in your life.<eos> Ride out your sick leave, then hand in your badge.<eos> No one is gonna think any less of you.
How are you feeling?<eos> Are you even listening to what I'm saying?<eos> Six.<eos> Six. Then hand in your badge.<eos> No one is gonna think any less of you.
It's too late.<eos> Of course not.<eos> I already lost you.<eos> No, sweetheart.<eos> We will always be here for you.
It's just... something doesn't feel right.<eos> Two, this is the bridge.<eos> Yeah, go ahead.<eos> There's something you should see.<eos> There is something different about you.
What are you talking about?<eos> As you may recall, I possess the ability to detect subtle changes in human physiology at short range.<eos> - Heart rate... - Yep. Respiration, skin temperature, pupil dilation, sweat production...<eos> Is there gonna be a point soon?<eos> I'm detecting something in you I've never seen before...
If it doesn't attack after around 30 seconds, I'll know I'm on the right track.<eos> What's the matter, sweetie?<eos> Is your mind playing tricks on you?<eos> You must get that from me.<eos> I got nothing from you.
And write down "calle..." "Cali" what?<eos> Is this a tall building that we need to get to so you can pick us up on the top of it?<eos> That's the address of the nearest us consulate in Bogota.<eos> Okay, but you have to actually come get us because we are Americans in peril.<eos> I'm sorry to tell you, but any time you travel internationally, you take a risk.
-I kind of told my mom I was performing.<eos> Look, Archie, I'm sorry, but for a million reasons, we're going to have to pretend our moment never happened.<eos> I'll see you later.<eos> Oh, finally, close that door.<eos> Ladies, I need you to look around the room.
- Yeah, I'll meet you there.<eos> It's odd. But I find myself liking what you've done to the house...<eos> You can think about that now?<eos> I have to think of something.<eos> I must leave you in their care from here.
Thank you anyways.<eos> It was very nice.<eos> But I'm not finished.<eos> We've heard quite enough.<eos> Do you want your money back?
Those two have their eyes on you.<eos> They have their eyes on you, cunt.<eos> Not my type.<eos> Not blonde enough?<eos> Ladies, have you met Ser Bronn of the Blackwater, hero of the Battle of Blackwater Bay?
He would have emerged into the lobby via this... door.<eos> Who are these people?<eos> Joanne Perly, Nicole Henry, both mothers.<eos> Catherine Tweedale, head teller.<eos> Why were you not lined up with the rest of the mothers?
Well, we were penned in like cattle!<eos> Nicole is expecting her second baby and it's not like they didn't have chairs.<eos> They thought there should be a number system.<eos> I didn't disagree.<eos> Which way were you all facing?
Thank you.<eos> Who the hell let the Bible-basher in?<eos> We don't make a habit of excluding the press.<eos> You can't control them, you can't control the story, and that's everything.<eos> Well, if you'll excuse me, I have a few more things to do before my day is quite over.
You should be thanking us we got to him before he carried out their instructions.<eos> Don't, Ma.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You heard my daughter.<eos> It's up to you.
It's so nice to meet the Moms.<eos> Oh. Actually, I'm Caitlin's mom, Liza.<eos> This is my very good friend Maggie.<eos> Yeah, we're roommates.<eos> Where do you ladies live?
Jesus, I didn't expect to find myself living in the future, but here I fucking well am.<eos> - Karin Parke?<eos> - Uh-huh. Vanessa Dahl.<eos> Please. Follow me.<eos> You're after information on our Project Swarm ADIs?
Her deep tendon reflexes are diminished.<eos> She's floppy.<eos> Her muscles are losing tone.<eos> What is it?<eos> What do you see?
You do realize those door fees help pay my salary.<eos> I'm Henry.<eos> - Henry Higgins.<eos> - Charmed.<eos> So, uh... what are you ladies up to?
Susan. It's nice to finally meet you.<eos> You as well.<eos> Now that Daniel's asked you to move in with him, things must be pretty serious.<eos> Yes.<eos> Hi. I'm Larissa. I'll be taking care of you today.
Heaven.<eos> And the furniture!<eos> Good evening.<eos> Table for two, please, for dinner.<eos> Are you staying here at the hotel?
Likewise.<eos> Oh, and good luck with your style session.<eos> This is Starlight Enterprises, the house that Erica built.<eos> That means changing the way you act, the way you sound and the way you look.<eos> Ladies, I give you Erica Raymond.
I'm taking Lea shopping.<eos> It's my good deed for the month.<eos> Why the sudden change of heart?<eos> I needed a pair of shoes.<eos> What are you looking for?
Hey!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Hey, what are you doing?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Hey, how're you ladies doing?
I said, this is the middle of nowhere.<eos> Are you the Kodas?<eos> I'm Asano Suzu.<eos> So, you're...<eos> I'm grateful for you coming all this way.
I just knew I was gonna drop it.<eos> No problem, ma'am.<eos> Happens all the time.<eos> There we go.<eos> Is there anything else you'd like to see? Uh...
Yes, Your Honor.<eos> I still strongly believe that my daughter belongs with me, but I'm willing to wait until we've had a chance to get to know each other better.<eos> Callie, this is what you want?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> And ladies, I'm assuming this is OK with you?
He taught him all the Psalms.<eos> All the worthy men wondered at how fast he learned.<eos> What, Carfin, do you feel the noose tightening?<eos> He'll kill me, master.<eos> I beg of you like I beg the Holy Virgin, put a word in for me with the boyar!
Now I'm five years clean.<eos> Ah, that's great. WOMAN 1: But you got to be diligent.<eos> You know, early detection is the key... that's why I come every year.<eos> Thing about cancer, can't just ignore it and wish for it to go away.<eos> Wow. You ladies are a lot braver than I am.
Absolutely not, but... if I had to guess, I'd say the theory is that Colosseum's predatory recruitment tactics are a violation of the school's fiduciary duty towards its shareholders.<eos> Am I right?<eos> Uncanny.<eos> Just to recap, you're now facing a debt strike which is destroying your not-very-good name, a shareholder suit which could bankrupt you in court, and if either continues, the Feds are going to investigate and revoke your eligibility to receive funding.<eos> What do you want?
- You're up again.<eos> Okay, all right, hey, I'm about to class this joint up. "Happy Gilmore"?<eos> Who gets... who gets "Happy Gilmore"?<eos> "Hater" Gilmore over there. Lovely ladies.<eos> Good to see you.
Do you know what it says in Timothy 3:1-5?<eos> "In the last days, critical times hard to deal with will be here.<eos> For men will be lovers of themselves."<eos> Sounds like my ex-husband.<eos> Would you like to come in?
I agree.<eos> But he's right.<eos> Fashion is not talk.<eos> It's work.<eos> In point of fact, instead of this interview, wouldn't you rather see the work?
How are things over at Degrassi High?<eos> Do you ladies know where Bifrost is? Uh, duh!<eos> You guys suck.<eos> So, this pad of paper that he borrowed to write down the address...<eos> I would like for you to give it to me, please, if you would.
The school is in the saloon?<eos> It's the only place big enough To hold our children, miss thatcher.<eos> We had requested A mature, experienced teacher,<eos> Someone who would not shrink from the challenges That coal valley presents.<eos> I realize I'm perhaps not what you expected, But I assure you I am acquainted With the most modern teaching theories,
I was just...<eos> - Oh, so you just wanna take it?<eos> Nobody takes this bear.<eos> It's for our grandniece.<eos> - No, no, I think you misunderstand me.
It sounds dirty.<eos> We're not revoking Mr. Gerlin's miles due to fraud or even because Micky's not a human being, but rather for violating our conduct policy.<eos> - I'm confused.<eos> - Yeah, and I'm bored.<eos> Why don't you two ladies settle this the old-fashioned way, a Jell-O wrestling?
You promised you would come to the show.<eos> I have no recollection of that happening.<eos> Ticket!<eos> Get your ticket!<eos> You ladies have tickets?
A jailbird.<eos> ~ I don't believe you.<eos> ~ Because you don't want to.<eos> I would only say that I am not that person now.<eos> When you've finished your tea, we can walk the terraces, if you like.
We move to exhume miss Stangard's body.<eos> We believe a second autopsy will point to Rebecca Sutter as the sole murderer.<eos> - Your Honor, hasn't the victim's family - Mr. Keegan is making outlandish remarks<eos> - suffered enough already? - In order to fuel vitriol about my client!<eos> The two of you will have plenty of time to righteously object at the hearing tomorrow morning.
- I don't know.<eos> Then I'll take your best guess!<eos> And just to let you know, Jeffries, I'm not a copper anymore, so there are no niceties that I need to abide to.<eos> Will the accused please rise.<eos> You have all been charged with unlawful assembly and causing a public nuisance.
What's happening?<eos> ~ Mum! ~ It's OK.<eos> It's all right. ~ What has he done?<eos> What have you done?<eos> We need to speak to both of you at the station.
Well, Audrey practically is.<eos> I mean, she's in marketing.<eos> She just moved here from San Diego.<eos> Then welcome to our fair city.<eos> And would you ladies care to join us?
- Very good, George.<eos> - Detective!<eos> Detective!<eos> Stop!<eos> What are you doing here?
And what's that above it?<eos> The Arkenstone.<eos> Arkenstone.<eos> And what's that?<eos> That, Master Burglar... is why you are here.
'I am the king of the Jews."'<eos> It stays as I 've commanded. The king of the Jews.<eos> Cowards!<eos> Get away!<eos> My Lord. Bless you.
Stay for this. She's such a good young singer.<eos> Take a seat, please, and listen.<eos> Ladies, are you about to leave the hotel for the day?<eos> Yes, Mr Schlesinger.<eos> Well, if you wish to, and only if you wish to, you may use the front entrance from now on.
(LAUGHTER)<eos> What is that?<eos> Oh, dude, it's the wood.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Are you ladies gonna sun yourselves or what?
I would have come sooner, only, erm, Mr Woodrow, a gentleman I work for, had an urgent report and I do his typing so<eos> I couldn't just leave and tomorrow we've got a board meeting...<eos> I do the minutes and, well, that takes care of tomorrow and Friday's always our busiest day, what with people wanting to get it all out the way before their weekends, lucky them I say...<eos> Francine Spencer.<eos> How do you do?
I asked them to leave.<eos> They are looking for legal help.<eos> If you want to open a law office, do it someplace else.<eos> Not in my room!<eos> Ladies, if you don't mind.
One, two, three.<eos> Ooh-a, ooh-a Sorry, sorry, wait, stop.<eos> This is a closed rehearsal.<eos> - Yeah, we're investigating a murder.<eos> - Well, you won't find any clues here.
They should just cut his head off.<eos> Is that what you'd do, Margaret?<eos> Take a man's life so readily? Hmm?<eos> He has gone against his rightful king and God. My Lord.<eos> Thank you.
Honestly, Camille, sometimes your faith in the unscientific astounds me.<eos> So, I'm guessing this case has done nothing to ease your nun phobia.<eos> If I never see another nun again, it'll be too soon.<eos> Relax. I'm not here to check your underpants.<eos> Have you two been talking?
Madam, how was your dinner today?<eos> It was delicious, thank you.<eos> How about you, miss?<eos> It was delicious.<eos> Thank you very much. We hope to see you again.
You're a little brighter than I gave you credit for, Ash.<eos> Anyway, it made me realise I wasn't ready to make that kind of sacrifice for Tracey, so I ended it.<eos> I want the kind of love they have, one day.<eos> Where is that miserable piece of shit?<eos> I'm right here, you walking corpse.
There's a lot at stake, Don.<eos> Look... you told me.<eos> Did I disappear?<eos> We need to play this out, but if push comes to shove, we put Holbrook where he belongs.<eos> You ladies done whispering?
We got more cattle heading up main street.<eos> The question in durant these days is, "where's the beef?"<eos> And the answer is, "everywhere you turn."<eos> Excuse me, ladies.<eos> What do you think About everything that's going on here today?
Um, sir?<eos> Uh, excuse me.<eos> We're looking for a CJ Pierce.<eos> I'm CJ.<eos> Who are you?
He thought I had cheated on him.<eos> So you're raising Daphne by yourself?<eos> Yes.<eos> But my mother is in Puerto Rico, and I'm sure she's willing to move here.<eos> Aren't the two of you estranged?
Nice having you back.<eos> Oh, it was nice to be back, even if it was just for one day.<eos> Mr. Stokes.<eos> What can we do for you?<eos> Earlier, you two were only doing your jobs, but I assumed the worst, and I'm... sorry.
[Clears throat] Oh, Miss Porter, this is my very good friend Tom Haverford.<eos> He's a big fan of your...<eos> Whatever you call what you do.<eos> Please speak to each other while I leave.<eos> Oh, no, I am not done with you, you wicked little so-and-so.
No, I got a new cat.<eos> - Yeah, yeah, cat.<eos> - That's a big-ass cat.<eos> Sure is.<eos> Ladies, you better get out of here.
No.<eos> We'd just left this bridal boutique near the plaza.<eos> Nadia's getting married in June.<eos> And did you notice anyone standing near the light post? I don't think so.<eos> Okay, well, I'm gonna need you to tell us everything that you remember from just before the bombing, starting with where you were.
Where... where's the limo?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It was right here.<eos> And we're running again! Aah!<eos> Do you... not have a car?
Sort of a jack of all trades.<eos> Like a jockey of all trades, if you will.<eos> Oh, but we won't.<eos> Well, if you play, Then you must know which player number one is guarded by.<eos> Ladies, could you give us a second, please? Thank you.
And I have not forgotten you.<eos> Get started, don't delay.<eos> She should be cured by evening.<eos> By evening!<eos> Lord, God almighty, in your grace You healed men who were blind from birth. Heal now your daughter, here. Look upon us sinners, as we beg and pray to you.
It hurts! Hang in there!<eos> Hang in there!<eos> I'll get you to the hospital as soon as I can.<eos> I just want to apologize one more time on behalf of the store... for any stress that I might have caused you.<eos> Here, you can keep the sweatshirt as a gift.
Your Ladyship!<eos> How wonderful to see you back.<eos> - Miss Shaw...<eos> - Thank you!<eos> I put you in your usual rooms.
- Seriously?<eos> - Whatever you want.<eos> Yeah, whatever you want, baby.<eos> Thank you.<eos> But I need you to get dressed.
NCIS.<eos> Kimberly, want someone to help you out of here?<eos> No, thank you.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Ladies, could you give us a second?
Yeah, and what about this guy?<eos> He's always going to the museum with the thing and the Warhols and all that.<eos> Hey, listen, I retired that move like three years ago.<eos> It was better than some lame long-eared dog, okay?<eos> Lately I've been doing this romantic train ride thing, and the ladies love it, you know.
Welcome to my den...<eos> of iniquity.<eos> I'm kidding.<eos> Mostly.<eos> But you ladies need to officially join the party.
- Sorry, it's policy.<eos> - Okay. Okay, maybe you could bend your policy for one night.<eos> I mean, clearly-- Listen, my-- my, um, fiancé's actually in there--<eos> - Yeah. - Having his stag party, and we're gonna crash it.<eos> So if you could just let us in-- ladies, if you don't have your I.D.s, - could you please step aside?
I'm dreadfully sorry, everybody, but it appears I shall have to leave you in the hands of my captivating co-host.<eos> Well, I shall be more than delighted to entertain the ladies.<eos> Mr. Wells, do tell us about your next story.<eos> Yes, Charles, do tell.<eos> Oh, well, I'm afraid you'll just have to wait.
He raped my son.<eos> He pushed my son to kill himself.<eos> Betsy, where's Jason?<eos> Oh, my God, what are you insinuating?<eos> I think it's time for you to leave.
I'm not giving up on romance.<eos> I'll show her we still got it, no matter what anybody else says!<eos> I didn't say anything.<eos> Wouldn't dare.<eos> Now, if you ladies are done, I'm gonna take the rest of this food and turn it into a magical dinner for two!
Don't ask.<eos> I've been up half the night.<eos> You're all right, you've got time.<eos> Man!<eos> Ladies, if I could interrupt you a second...
You know Christine Riviere has been killed?<eos> Stabbed 3 times.<eos> Her house, Saturday night.<eos> I didn't know.<eos> You weren't on good terms, I believe?
What about you?<eos> I'm going to stay behind and look for Hassan.<eos> Ma'am, I just got off the phone with CTU.<eos> They're going to help me find your husband.<eos> But right now it's not safe here for you.
- Yeah.<eos> She sent me a text message from a motel somewhere between home and the festival.<eos> I've been checking all the hotels and motels in the area.<eos> I think this must be my ninth since lunch.<eos> - You're quite similar.
I think it's romantic.<eos> - He was defending your honor.<eos> - I don't need defending.<eos> Oh, everyone needs defending.<eos> Well, hello. And who are all of you?
It's what made you afraid of Zephyra.<eos> You thought that her obsession with the black arts could destroy you.<eos> You also knew that she had Ember's ancestor's bones on her side.<eos> You're, you're, you're good witches.<eos> You're nice people. You don't lie, but when you make a mistake, you want to make that mistake right, right?
I'll take a trim.<eos> You want DeAndre back in the game, out of custody, you're gonna have to help me understand a few things.<eos> You want me to cut your hair... And do your job, too?<eos> Well, I'm doing my job.<eos> In fact, where were you three ladies the night Curtis Taylor was killed?
I don't have an account at Turner Creek Bank.<eos> No, but Patriot Limited does.<eos> And that's you.<eos> May I?<eos> Who are you?
Bastard!<eos> Bastard!<eos> Bastard!<eos> Bastard!<eos> /She's a special girl, you know
She is a bitch.<eos> She is, you're right.<eos> I think she's almost the only person in the world I honestly can't stand.<eos> She is not the only person I can't stand.<eos> Do you two know each other?
How are you, KambIe?<eos> - Fine, Sir. Sir, sit. Your wife's not at home?<eos> Sir.. What?<eos> KambIe! This is your second wife who's run away.<eos> What do you do? Do you beat them?
You don't even have cable ?<eos> I told you there's nothing to do here.<eos> Hi, Jessi. How are you ?<eos> How are you doing ?<eos> What are you two ladies up to this evening ?
But he's really embarassed about it. So don't say it.<eos> Hi, I'm Bette Porter.<eos> - Hi, Tina Kennard.<eos> - Hey, Jacky.<eos> You hear about the adoption?
That's why we chose an African-American donor, so that she would look like both of us.<eos> Well, how does she look like her?<eos> - Could you stop it?<eos> - I'm wondering. Marci, it's OK.<eos> Are you, uh, still together with the father?
- I'm wondering. Marci, it's OK.<eos> Are you, uh, still together with the father?<eos> No. He was just a donor.<eos> I adopted Angelica from birth.<eos> But you're married.
It's only a dress, Lil.<eos> It's only us here together.<eos> Where's the harm in trying it on?<eos> In't you just a bit curious how you might look?<eos> I wonder if I might prevail upon your good nature and ask you to display one of my posters in your window?
Your Grace can see with your own eyes that I am old and sick and unfit to travel<eos> Allow me to speak openly to Your Grace.<eos> although I love and trust the King absolutely and know that he would always treat me justly and mercifully.<eos> I can not say the same for some of his councillors.<eos> I would rather fear to fall into their hands my Lord. Allow me to reassure you.
Highway Patrol found their bodies this morning.<eos> They were both murdered. Oh, my God.<eos> Um, was there any sign of Molly?<eos> They only found two bodies.<eos> In Molly's relationship with the Gillums... were there any problems that either of you two were aware of? What do you mean?
- It was Jamie and lan's idea.<eos> - You told me he was Jamie's mate!<eos> - We thought he was the best match.<eos> Thought?<eos> I'm having a limo party this Sunday if you're up for a good night, ladies.
I'm glad you've noticed.<eos> Is there a cause?<eos> Yes.<eos> Er, we'll take these dresses, and this hat, some socks, gloves.<eos> Perhaps you'd be so kind as to put together a selection of your own choice of other necessities?
Now, the ache.<eos> Zillah, I'm sure we have some medicine that Ruby might take.<eos> I do hope there's nothing wrong to keep you all so awake?<eos> It is said that nocturnal wakefulness is due to a mental disturbance.<eos> There is something, as you have so wisely fathomed.
I also need your cell phones, pdas, wallets,<eos> Any photos of your family,<eos> And the keys to your homes and cars.<eos> And if we refuse?<eos> And I need you to turn your packets inside out.
Well, you probably remember us at the party, Exchanging our usual pleasantries.<eos> You can't push me aside.<eos> Don't you ever threaten my children, Wilhelmina.<eos> You have no idea the lengths I will go to protect them.<eos> You're not doing a very good job of explaining how you're innocent.
(BingIey) wickham, wherefore does this horse not go backwards?<eos> nevertheless, my dearest, will you indulge me by remaining in here for the moment?<eos> (wickham) Bring it this way, sir. whip your horse...<eos> Mrs Bennet, ladies, welcome. - Er, did you have a...? - A most pleasant journey, Mr Darcy.<eos> - Thank you.
Attagirl!<eos> Milk for my bride.<eos> In fact, milks all around.<eos> Milks all around.<eos> - Hey, where you ladies from?
- Here you go, ladies.<eos> - He reminds me of my husband.<eos> Everybody thought we were a total mismatch but we had so much fun.<eos> Hey!<eos> What are you ladies talkin' about over here?
No, you tell it.<eos> You're the good, uh, teller of it.<eos> - Please?<eos> - All right, all right. Sure.<eos> - You ladies heard of pro wrestling?
Aww, what misfortune!<eos> Once again we work for peanuts! What you been doing in the woods at night, without a Guinea in your pocket?<eos> Uuh I'm looking for a noble knights for my uncle, who is very, very rich.<eos> Wait a minute, very, very rich?<eos> You are real knights, aren't you, my lord?
Oh,I'm sorry.<eos> Sorry.<eos> And his real estate company screwed you out of $10 million?<eos> That's right,because of a legal action I filed against them.<eos> Why'd you file a legal action?
# We're talking about brunettes not fighter jets #<eos> # Oh-ho-ho, it's got to be # # Sweet 16s not M-16s #<eos> # When will the governments realize # # It's got to be funky sexy ladies?<eos> #<eos> # I have a vision and all I can see # # Is all of you with all of me # # In a world of peace and harmony #
- Someone older.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Careful of having expectations.<eos> They only lead to disappointment.<eos> Where did you hear that?
I don't really like Billy's script.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Welcome to Marquis Jet, gentlemen.<eos> And a very warm welcome it is.<eos> Will you ladies be joining us on our trip to France?
Well, um... there's no minimum agreement. Nana, Petrova's been wearing my...<eos> This is nice.<eos> Put photographs on here.<eos> Good afternoon.<eos> Have you come about the rooms?
When I first started the company.<eos> Well, we knew each other already.<eos> We were friends.<eos> I see.<eos> - How did you meet each other?
I love you.<eos> See you, buddy.<eos> - Bye, Daddy.<eos> - Bye.<eos> - Good evening, all you boys and some girls.
Well, someone else.<eos> I really do feel awful about this.<eos> But the royal proclamation declared...<eos> Yes, but it would appear that, more than one girl... actually fits the... the slipper.<eos> I'm very sorry to have inconvenienced you.
We must practice our profession.<eos> We'll travel the countryside for months, years if necessary.<eos> We'll play in every town, every village, every hamlet!<eos> We'll make a name for ourselves, the rest will follow in time.<eos> Ladies, you'll be surprised, no doubt, by the audacity of my visit.
For me, a snake is just a snake, a slingback is just a slingback.<eos> Gilmore?<eos> Hi.<eos> I'm Dr. Goldstein.<eos> - You're Richard Gilmore's family?
I'm not trying to freak you out, roomie, but I just totally came.<eos> Is this where Laura Johnson and Sara Coleman live?<eos> Yeah, I'm Laura Johnson and this is my roommate, Sara.<eos> My name is Dwight Stifler.<eos> I'm here with the Freshman Welcoming Committee, and I've been given instructions to escort you ladies on a guided tour of the entire campus.
How did they get your dad's email?<eos> Is he gonna get you out?<eos> They're not gonna let me go.<eos> Relax.<eos> Are you ladies talking about me?
Sure enough!<eos> Damn sure, right?<eos> Ouch! It hurts.<eos> Hibiscus, your tank man is here.<eos> What are you ladies doing?
And I promise, no more talk about dodgy weight loss methods.<eos> Like the highly effective, non-F.D.A. approved diet pill<eos> I can get from my friends in zurich... in bulk.<eos> Well, I suppose the Christian thing would be to forgive her.<eos> Well, why don't you ladies talk it over?
- Load them up and bring them back to me as soon as possible...<eos> Every single one... - Oh... - No Doctor...<eos> Bring them back to me... every single one...<eos> No... somebody...<eos> Thank you, thank you Ladies and Gentlemen, It is a great honour to be here today... to receive Noble Prize...
Much warmer. I just told you:<eos> I'm fine. Okay.<eos> You know... it's the ladie's room here.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Yes, so can you tell this man to go wash somewhere else?
I'm ever so glad you're here.<eos> I've been very anxious about Caddy.<eos> No need for anxiety, none at all.<eos> My own personal physician, Mr Growler, is attending her.<eos> Good day to you, ladies.
Then go and do as I tell you.<eos> This is as far as I may come.<eos> Any further, and Sir Arrogant Numskull's ruffians would set upon me.<eos> I think he's trained his very dogs to smell me out.<eos> But you ladies will be safe to roam the grounds as long as I'm not with you.
Yeah, he pared down, didn't he? Detective...<eos> Russell is not a nice man... but he's smart.<eos> And if he knew that I had copies of his old business files...<eos> We've got forensic accountants here.<eos> Why don't you bring those files in? Maybe we'll both benefit from them.
Well, they haven't really worked well for me lately, so why should I listen to them ?<eos> That's not true.<eos> - Oh, really ?<eos> Do I look pregnant to you ?<eos> - Ladies, - did you get...
Don't say a word to her.<eos> Don't even look at her.<eos> Mrs. McNeil, I want to apologize for an uncomfortable, but purely unintentional coincidence...<eos> The judge is going to hear about this.<eos> Well, in the meantime, would either of you ladies like a coffee or a tea or sparkling water?
We're at 14.<eos> - Count them with me. 15!<eos> - 15. - 16, 17... - 16, 17...<eos> Why, Joanie Stubbs and Miss Lila.<eos> What brings you to the air this fine spring morning?
Well, we'll never know.<eos> Oh, please, you don't have to stroke his ego, Dorothy.<eos> His ego, along with every other part of him, has been stroked quite enough in this lifetime.<eos> Well, thank you for bucking me up, darling.<eos> Now, if you two ladies will excuse me,
That's it. Why tie yourself to one?<eos> Where's the flavour?<eos> Where's the joy? When was the last time you had a woman who wasn't crying or wanting payment?<eos> You're on first watch.<eos> Wake me when the moon's at the zenith. Right you are, sir.
- I'm going to tell you a secret - Me?<eos> The bufeo's genitals look like a woman's and the natives use it to relieve themselves<eos> But there's a little problem, when they are done they have to kill the animal, because the suffer contractions so strong that don't let them get out<eos> Miss, no offense but can i ask you something? Yes<eos> What brings you to these inhospitable waters?
May we take you for a drive?<eos> May we?<eos> Why have we stopped?<eos> Come with us, Mr Kynaston.<eos> What are you up to?
It's important to have the support of you ladies.<eos> - Fancy a vol-au-vent?<eos> - Oh, yes, please.<eos> Hmm, that's delicious!<eos> Did you make them yourselves?
Did Mrs. Curtin ever talk about a man that she might've become close to?<eos> Maybe even started seeing?<eos> No.<eos> But Margie wouldn't confide in me about something like that.<eos> What'd you talk about?
This is just a hiccup.<eos> I can get another three, four months before they close the place down.<eos> I'll have to think about that.<eos> And then I saw the gun and then he drew it so I had no choice but to fire.<eos> How many rounds did you fire, captain?
And you say... "No, thank you.<eos> We're waiting for a sign from God."<eos> A few more days pass, and the water level has risen.<eos> It has risen above the roof.<eos> And unfortunately, you and Mr. Stalling have drowned and now are in heaven in front of God.
I don't think I was exactly macho.<eos> Trust me. If I ever catch a guy in his underwear in my refrigerator... I hope I'm half the man you were, Mrs...<eos> Right, okay. Whatever.<eos> All right, then, I'm definitely gonna hit the road.<eos> Ladies, sensational meeting you.
We'd like to get you started with a little amuse-bouche.<eos> I'd like him to amuse my bush.<eos> - This just looks delicious.<eos> - It's our summer vegetable soup.<eos> I see you guys are set for drinks, I'll give you a minute with the menus.
I bought shares of your newspaper yesterday.<eos> Really?<eos> Thank you, sweetie.<eos> - No, you're cheap. - I never... - Ladies.<eos> - Thank you.
So long, Mr. Vitti.<eos> I can't take it anymore!<eos> That's what I hate about you fucking sociopaths!<eos> You keep changing the rules to suit yourselves!<eos> Well, not this time, you antisocial, misfit piece of shit!
Open it, please.<eos> Thank vou.<eos> - What are these for?<eos> - A present for mv brother.<eos> You are together?
God damn!<eos> Who the fuck's knocking on the door like the police!<eos> Hey, y'all, it is the police!<eos> Turn that shit down. Put this shit out.<eos> Oh, how are you, officers?
Sorry, Elvis, the wedding party has to leave the building.<eos> - What?<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> What's going on?<eos> All three of you ladies are coming in for questioning in the murder of Darren Pyne.
This is Sgt. Godley.<eos> We're investigating the murders of Polly Nichols and Martha Tabram.<eos> We understand they were both friends of you ladies.<eos> Close friends.<eos> We're hoping you'd be able to help us.
The new flag for the event with our Russian friends.<eos> Foto.<eos> I think they've made the cross of St George a little too small?<eos> - Could you point at it? - Yeah.<eos> Both of you.
One more time?<eos> Well you called it a loan, it wasn't a loan, it was an investment.<eos> We are investors.<eos> Investors?<eos> The problem I think, is you're confusing the word singularity with the word continuity.
Two of our favorite writers and I'm stuck on a boat.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Well, the video of our recording has already hit over a million views.<eos> The TV station has never seen anything like it. So, my boss, Kobi Kihara, was wondering if we could do a follow-up story on you.<eos> Do you believe in happy endings?
Can we ask you some questions about James Edlund?<eos> Participation in this group is confidential.<eos> You know what Edlund did?<eos> I watched the mayor's press conference.<eos> And I wish I could help, but you have to understand, I take confidentiality seriously.
Well, then who solved...<eos> Of course. - How can I help you?<eos> - Yes, ma'am, we need to evacuate the building immediately.<eos> We're in the middle of an important tournament.<eos> Are you sure?
If you're asking did I shoot your crazy ass and send you to Arkham, then, yeah.<eos> I'm guilty.<eos> The sentence is death by beheading.<eos> To be carried out immediately.<eos> You do know your new masters are nothing but a pack of murderers, don't you?
Please, sir, look...<eos> look at the signs.<eos> - Uh, sir, it's employees only.<eos> Gus Fring is a pillar of our local business community, and not just for underwriting our travel raffle, but for making the best damn chicken in town!<eos> - Gus. - Thank you. Thank you.
Someone had to stand up for Our Lord.<eos> - You were meant to keep us safe!<eos> - The threat was made against you.<eos> So far as I can see, you're still here.<eos> I really don't know why you've come by.
This way, please.<eos> So, this is where he was taken.<eos> I found Haley on the ground right here.<eos> Look, my wife's not thinking straight right now.<eos> And I'm sure you guys understand she's freaking out.
Sorry, it takes me a little longer.<eos> I'm not as fast as I used to be.<eos> - Dr. Victor Shelley?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Obviously, you're here about Dr. Hampton.
He has been in numerous skirmishes, he is the most able navigator.<eos> Ned Pellew thinks the world of him.<eos> Of course the boy knows what's expected of him... he's a Boscawen, after all!<eos> Though little good it's done him.<eos> Will you excuse me?
I guess I will tread water.<eos> See you soon.<eos> Gentlemen, I am so sorry about the delay.<eos> My attorney will be arriving tout de suite.<eos> In the meantime, can I offer you a drink, or...
So Rorke and his partners steal something out of Hadley's safe, and then they call Hadley.<eos> Yeah, which, Hadley conveniently forgets to tell Danny and I when we spoke to him.<eos> So, then, is it just me, or is this starting to look more like an extortion attempt?<eos> That's ridiculous.<eos> I have no idea what you're talking about.
More like a ristorante to me.<eos> Look at that fresco.<eos> Supposed to be the hills of Elba?<eos> Not once you've seen 'em.<eos> Are you ready to order? Si.
You've given us a lot to think about.<eos> We'll give you an answer in a couple of weeks.<eos> We need to head home for Sinking Day.<eos> Well, it has been an absolute pleasure meeting you.<eos> If you have any questions at all, you can email me directly.
I'm sold.<eos> Just to be sure,<eos> You're right.<eos> Welcome to our annual Sinking Day celebration!<eos> - What do you think?
Coverage of his legal fees... sold.<eos> Protection from having his fingers hacked off and shoved into his mouth by the cartel.<eos> Throw in a dozen crullers, and you got a deal.<eos> Half of those are mine. My fee.<eos> Now, if you gentlemen will excuse me,
- Or I'm gonna cuff you right here in front of your fan club.<eos> Docket Number 16CR2876.<eos> People of the State of Illinois versus Kenneth J. Banks and Stephen T. Kim.<eos> Charges are first-degree murder, three counts, attempted murder, one count.<eos> You boys have been busy.
Yeah. I just think that it's...<eos> Oh. Well, I'm just, um... Nope.<eos> Okay. You're okay.<eos> We'll just get those... addresses later. Yeah.<eos> I know you were en route to talk to a contact to speak about the explosives that were used.
I do.<eos> If that's the case and Rhodes knew what he was up to,<eos> Tinker might have killed him.<eos> And now he's headed to Tokyo with the plans.<eos> I want you both on that plane.
Tonight he wants to look at ladders at Home Depot.<eos> Oh, why does he need a ladder?<eos> He doesn't; he just likes looking at them. Bring a book.<eos> Gentlemen.<eos> You may remember Dr. Nowitzki,
But it doesn't help me.<eos> The British Olympic Association are trying to stop me, but I have to do this.<eos> This year 61 meters. Next year it'll be 71 meters.<eos> Then it's too late.<eos> I am going up that hill to jump and you are going to record my distance.
- Does it have two beds?<eos> - Naturally.<eos> - Breakfast included?<eos> - Breakfast won't be necessary, thanks.<eos> - Are you here for the fishing?
I'll talk to Baker.<eos> Leslie Banks is virtually my age, and he's still staggering around the studios, giving his unhinged all as young love gone bad--<eos> Oh, no, no, no, Cerberus. Too much glass.<eos> You know, if you paid your clients half as much attention as you do that hyena, you might actually be an agent worth having.<eos> Spitfires. Won't you help to buy--
That man's trouble.<eos> Afternoon, gentlemen.<eos> Town's got a ban on firearms.<eos> Check 'em in. Get 'em back on your way out.<eos> You don't mind me asking, but how is it all of you go so well-heeled?
Thanks, Mr. Weathers.<eos> Hope you picked something up from watching me.<eos> A week ago, you were riding a bicycle.<eos> Welcome to Geldon Dodge.<eos> Can we get you a cup of complimentary coffee?
Then the ACARS data is wrong.<eos> The evidence shows that the left engine was at idle or sub-idle immediately following the bird strike.<eos> You show me the left engine, I'll show you dead birds and no power.<eos> The left engine was lost in the crash due to excessive damage on touchdown.<eos> Let's just assume that it was, as you say, a dual engine loss due to bird strike.
What's the trouble, officer?<eos> Accident, sir. Fatal.<eos> Pretty little thing too.<eos> Red head.<eos> - Where is it you're trying to go?
I claim my prize.<eos> That's amazing.<eos> The flexibility.<eos> You should have seen her when she was 15.<eos> You guys looking for me?
Our power problems, they've been so, uh... _ Ubiquitous and... Mendacious and polyglottal.<eos> Like a couple of donkey balls.<eos> Received and understood, Rocinante.<eos> You get those comms checked out when you hit port.<eos> You got it, fellas.
- My ribs are still aching.<eos> You have an enormous comic talent, Mrs Foster Jenkins.<eos> It was so funny.<eos> Oh, thank you very much. Um... Um...<eos> I must be on... Good afternoon to you.
I then noticed a package with a shipping label. It said "O.J. Simpson".<eos> I then showed Detectives Lange and Vannatter what I had observed and, in discussing the situation, we became concerned that it was possible Mr. Simpson himself might also be in danger.<eos> Injured, or worse.<eos> Well, that makes total sense.<eos> What did you do in response to this reasonable concern?
You continually make statements about me and race, Mr. Cochran...<eos> Wait. Wait, all right, stop it, both of you!<eos> This is all improper.<eos> And I'm so mad at both of you guys right now, I'm about to hold the two of you in contempt.<eos> Let's take a recess so you can cool off.
- What's that?<eos> - It's... Ah.<eos> They're so nice. Mother of the bride!<eos> And the girls! It's all happening, gentlemen.<eos> Made it to the altar. And I owe it all to you.
Little pit Marval!<eos> Monsieur and Madame Snake And their offspring!<eos> Hercules, who lifts 150 kilos, ladies and gentlemen.<eos> And Esmeralda, The thiefest lady in the world!<eos> And now, especially for you tonight ...
Today marks the beginning of a new trade route, Mr Roper.<eos> And the beginning of a beautiful friendship, to coin a phrase.<eos> - Mr Barghati. - How are you?<eos> - Very well, thank you.<eos> As you can see, the trucks are loaded with the spec as agreed.
- No.<eos> No, I know it's stupid, but I think I must go through with it.<eos> Good luck, then.<eos> As the adversaries have refused a reconciliation, we shall proceed.<eos> At the count of three, you may advance towards each other.
Good luck, then.<eos> As the adversaries have refused a reconciliation, we shall proceed.<eos> At the count of three, you may advance towards each other.<eos> You may not go further than the swords marking the barrier.<eos> After the count of three, you may fire at any time.
The foothills.<eos> The Boedickers.<eos> I heard they got burned down.<eos> It's true, but Aaron Boedicker is still alive.<eos> You guys, you did see the yellow tape here, right?
Hi, everyone.<eos> Harry Takayama, CPA.<eos> OK, people, I have a flight to catch.<eos> Let's get to the bottom of this.<eos> You three gentlemen, sit.
It's gonna be a little harder than I thought.<eos> I mean, I'd hate to see you let her down.<eos> I mean, she thinks so highly of you.<eos> Trudy's taste in men has always been questionable.<eos> Maybe I should leave, so you two can put your dicks on the table, next to them toothpicks. - - Ooh...
If this is about the Policeman's Ball, we have tickets already.<eos> Yeah. Is everything all right?<eos> Yes, everything is fine.<eos> I don't understand your implication.<eos> What are you implying?
Couldn't know he was also a man of the faith.<eos> You don't have to be worried about my influence on my brother, Reverend.<eos> I can assure you he's never listened to me.<eos> No, my brother here, he's all, um, fire and no brimstone.<eos> Now, if you will excuse me, I'm expected in the city by noon.
Mr. Harrison, I would like to attend today's briefing.<eos> And why is that?<eos> Sir, the data changes so fast.<eos> The capsule changes. The weight and the landing zones are all changing, every day.<eos> I do my work, you attend these briefings, I have to start over.
Yeah, go ahead and send me a pic, that'd be very helpful.<eos> Sir, shoot me if you must, but it is imperative that I look at these pictures.<eos> The hell with this.<eos> I'm getting my money back if it's the last thing I do. Hey, here's the guys.<eos> Who are you and why are you here?
What you waiting for?<eos> Gift horse and all that... am I right?<eos> Why don't you go ahead, open up that safe, my man?<eos> Oh... hello there.<eos> If you miscreants don't mind, we're looking for Malcolm Graham.
May we see him, please?<eos> I'll go and ask Madame.<eos> What is it, Odile?<eos> Two gentlemen want to speak to Monsieur Moncin.<eos> What do you want?
I don't know how it could have happened.<eos> We will have to engrave new plates, obviously.<eos> But that will take weeks, weeks during which the counterfeiters can flood the market with printed notes that will be impossible to tell from legitimate notes.<eos> And all this was conducted under the noses of the city police.<eos> How do you explain that?
Hold on, Uncle.<eos> We got to gather us a nigger tax.<eos> I ain't got no money.<eos> How 'bout you just hand over the tar baby?<eos> You gentlemen, you got it all wrong.
You're going to tell the truth.<eos> You can't have it both ways, Governor.<eos> We got him, period.<eos> Unilateral, short-sighted action.<eos> Unilateral because you and the general pitted the Republicans against my involving the Russians.
But, dude, seriously, it is so weird that you slept with both of them when they were each other.<eos> I mean, come on. Relationships are confusing enough as it is without getting into that kind of, you know... bizarre arithmetic.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> Books.<eos> I'm sorry. Are you relatives of Mr. Nebojsa?
The Hunt Valley Nuclear Research Facility.<eos> Right outside of Baltimore.<eos> They were robbed an hour ago by a group of armed men who took an isotope transfer cask.<eos> All right, let's go.<eos> You guys are a little late to the party.
I-I can't leave here tonight.<eos> I'm afraid we're gonna have to insist.<eos> Okay, what is this all about?<eos> We're investigating a double homicide, and we think the same individual responsible for attacking your son attacked them.<eos> But didn't you hear him?
You were at a planning meeting.<eos> Fine, I'm in.<eos> Sounds like fun.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Listen, as long we're here, can I hire you for another job?
- I build 'em.<eos> I don't fill 'em.<eos> - Is this the guy who brought you the car?<eos> Never saw him before.<eos> Were you officers aware that it is now legal to build concealed traps in cars in the state of Illinois?
Get a load of this guy.<eos> Can you imagine if we make money with this?<eos> If we do, I am splurging on the best sinus irrigator money can buy.<eos> That old sad story-- guy gets a little money, goes straight up his nose.<eos> Just need you to review and sign this document acknowledging that you understand the university will own 75% of the patent.
You want to give me another one of your business cards?<eos> Ms. Healy, hello. Uh, this is Agent Blades.<eos> Can we ask you a few questions?<eos> Sure.<eos> Uh, would you like to sit down?
"Other guy"? The other guy!<eos> The other guy!<eos> Where's the other guy?<eos> I'm sorry. I'm the only coroner on duty today.<eos> What department did you say you were from?
Okay, no, no, not mine. Yours.<eos> Hang on a second.<eos> Can we discuss our options?<eos> Gentlemen, I'm Alicia Reynaud.<eos> And you are Marcus Boone and Ryo Ishida.
- Oh, yeah.<eos> - Good.<eos> Ahem, I'm gonna go get a bottle of water.<eos> Be right back.<eos> Now, did you purchase anything from the minibar?
- Our angel's a criminal.<eos> - And our angel is drunk.<eos> The angel puked.<eos> - Hey, you Melvin?<eos> - I am, who are you?
I will report to you as soon as possible.<eos> Clear your heads.<eos> If you can move, go help the injured!<eos> Department Head!<eos> What are you all doing?
How's about savin' all your time for me?<eos> You think all hotels are good.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Here we are.<eos> Where are you gentlemen going?
I intend to place all of English magic into his hands and then I shall command him to do it.<eos> There is a danger, sir, that if we succeed in breaking the spell the Lady will return to the state she was in before.<eos> Namely, death.<eos> She has often said she would rather be dead than as she now is.<eos> You should try what you can do.
The TV was on.<eos> You didn't hear anything?<eos> The TV was on.<eos> The-the TV was on. Yeah.<eos> Are you sure you don't want some coffee cake? Yeah.
- Investigation Unit, yeah. - Right.<eos> We don't have an air crash.<eos> _<eos> I've told DCI Morton that we will extend him every consideration.<eos> All right, if you'll excuse me.
- Good evening.<eos> And how will you be paying, sir?<eos> - Excuse me? - Your donation. What's your preferred method of payment?<eos> Oh, no, these are already paid for. We're guests of Russ Hanneman.<eos> Yes, he reserved the tickets, but you have to pay for them.
Oh, well.<eos> I got the idea by reading about Paris Ormskirk, you see.<eos> Ormskirk's spells never worked.<eos> Well, they never worked for anyone, not even Ormskirk!<eos> Are you magicians?
Our former dispensing chemist did have a degree.<eos> Yes, he certainly did.<eos> You've just been lucky, Mr Anijs.<eos> A beautiful wife and a flourishing chemist's shop.<eos> If you'll excuse us...
Why are you here, Inspector?<eos> I should like to know why you visited Scotland Yard on September the 27th last year to speak with my predecessor... Inspector Galsworthy.<eos> Oh, yes, that.<eos> Rather whimsical sort of thing actually.<eos> - What did you talk about?
Uh, I'm just gonna be honest with the guy.<eos> Honesty will never get us in.<eos> Well, what's your plan?<eos> All right, my plan is predicated on the assumption that they have a nurse's office and your willingness to be lightly stabbed.<eos> Who are you here to see?
The mayor of bluebell and his lawyer going door-to-door for the local senior center.<eos> Yeah, well, we-we like to do our part.<eos> Oh. Certainly do.<eos> We love old people.<eos> Well, if you'll excuse me, I have some work to attend to...
Do that again!<eos> On to new business.<eos> The Search Committee has been tireless in its quest to identify a builder to finish construction on the new hospital without further delay or unanticipated expense.<eos> After careful consideration, we are pleased to nominate for the job Mr. Raphael Warren of the firm Tate, Warren, and Bond.<eos> His CV is in front of you, but I think you're already acquainted with his work, especially the lavish hotels he's built in midtown for Colonel Astor.
Please.<eos> I shall keep it as a memento of Doris.<eos> Good.<eos> Good night, Roger.<eos> ~ Gentlemen, would you like a table?
Thought we'd stop for some waffles.<eos> Gale's idea.<eos> Heard you had some real good ones around here.<eos> So you can imagine our surprise when we find the place closed and, apparently, the scene of a crime.<eos> What size shoes you boys wear?
What are you, having a baby in there?<eos> Hello.<eos> You didn't tell me your family was in from out of town.<eos> Unh-unh. Whoops.<eos> Got to ask you your business here.
Is that right?<eos> Maybe tell us where he is.<eos> Make a few bucks.<eos> I was gonna ask you the same.<eos> Say, you wouldn't by any chance be Mike Milligan and The Kitchen Brothers, would you?
Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs.<eos> We're investigating a report of alleged noncompliance with federally funded clinical trials for a medication manufactured by Godfrey Industries.<eos> What sort of noncompliance?<eos> Paperwork Reduction Act.<eos> I'm sure I have no idea what you're talking about.
- Are you French?<eos> - Yes, like my aunt.<eos> How charming!<eos> ...absolutely, one room for two or two rooms full board, as one of our guests has just left.<eos> How long will you stay?
- A sandwich?<eos> - Same as us. To the sea.<eos> - An excursion.<eos> These are not good walking shoes.<eos> Does it not inconvenience you to take the priest in your car?
I ran away.<eos> I thought that the children would be better off without me.<eos> Better off?<eos> With an abusive alcoholic?<eos> I'd like you to leave now, both of you.
He's...<eos> He's actually drooling. The full resources of the US Fifth Fleet. The biggest show of American air power since North Vietnam.<eos> Every military base... Everywhere they could hide a nuclear weapon will be neutralized.<eos> We will completely remove their ability to wage war. You will return. You will reload.<eos> You will take off again. Gentlemen, you're about to send the Pakistani army back to the Chinese junkyard it crawled out from.
It is a very fine book.<eos> It is my hope that it will establish Norrellite magic for the modern age.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Yes, I believe do.<eos> You are the madhouse-keepers?
Not in the... fullest sense of the word.<eos> Uh! I beg your pardon.<eos> There we go.<eos> Your new lodgings, madam.<eos> So what are you, then?
The Duke, you mean?<eos> Concerned. He's worried that Napoleon will return.<eos> Why did they not give you a... baronetcy or something when they made him Duke?<eos> Lord Liverpool says they considered it, but they felt they would have to give Norrell something, too.<eos> ~ And I don't think anyone quite has the stomach to call him "My Lord". ~ Sirs, you are talking, not playing.
Such as?<eos> I will not tell you. You can come to your own arrangement with Mr Strange.<eos> You pay Mr Strange?<eos> Oh, yes. 70 guineas.<eos> And you have not met him?
I raise... 50.<eos> Call.<eos> Kings full of sixes.<eos> Gentlemen, I need to get some air.<eos> If you'll excuse me.
And then your dead brother's previously unknown lesbian daughter shows up, and then you let her move in.<eos> You can't write this stuff, huh?<eos> And then the two of you got married to each other.<eos> Yes.<eos> But you're not gay.
Perhaps a touch of astigmatism?<eos> Mr Edalji?<eos> Arthur Conan Doyle.<eos> And this is my secretary, Alfred Wood.<eos> How do you do, Sir Arthur, Mr Wood?
[knocking] Mr. Norcross.<eos> Detectives Dawson and...<eos> Orbinsky?<eos> That's close enough.<eos> Glad you came.
We did everything we could for him while he was in our care.<eos> Dr. Holtzman, how long have you been treating Mr. Lewis?<eos> Four years.<eos> We got him stable after his mother committed him, but a condition of his release were state-mandated sessions every month.<eos> And what did the two of you talk about?
You should have thought of that before you came barrelling over here like a lunatic!<eos> I'm sorry. I didn't -<eos> An assortment of free starters might help smooth things over.<eos> Um... OK.<eos> What would you like?
As far as I know.<eos> Isn't it your job to know? My job covers a wide range of responsibilities.<eos> You ever heard of Bankers Trust in Sacramento?<eos> Maybe you've heard of Simon Kincaid.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm sorry for your trouble.<eos> I'm sorry for yours.<eos> _<eos> Detective Miskova?<eos> Do all you Six boys buy your shoes at the same store?
- I have hemorrhoids.<eos> - Wow! You mean you'd do it otherwise.<eos> - That's right, he would.<eos> - What's up, kiddo?<eos> Sir, because you were laughing... That's why.
- What did you just say?<eos> - He didn't say anything, sir.<eos> - The kid's talking to himself. - You're totally getting on my nerves now.<eos> - Please, sir. - You're totally getting on my nerves!<eos> - Sir, can you please just leave? - Dude!
What about Paul Angelo, the guy that gave us up to Tyler Brunson?<eos> I'll speak to him.<eos> We want to be there when you...<eos> I'm handling Paul Angelo.<eos> Why don't you go home and get some rest?
Where does Jordan Sansone fit in?<eos> You're not hearing me.<eos> I know you know something.<eos> Do yourself a favor and tell me what you know.<eos> Then you need to talk with my attorney.
You would have made a good lawyer, you know that?<eos> I consider that an insult.<eos> So, where's my apology?<eos> Actually, I should be apologizing to the members of the Columbo and the Gambino family for comparing them to you.<eos> Are you ready to order, Gentlemen?
Joel Fitzgerald. Bill, I said there was no need for a lawyer.<eos> In fact, I told you we'd be content sitting down with your head of I.T.<eos> Well, to be honest, we were fighting over who got to take a meeting with the Morland Holmes.<eos> I, myself, can never get enough backslapping, but I'm afraid our time here is limited.<eos> Obviously you're aware of the sniper attacks in Mannahatta Park today.
Any other discussion?<eos> Mrs. Florrick, do you have any discussion about this very important issue?<eos> Would you like me to have some?<eos> I would like you to speak for yourself.<eos> I think that the two of you... have issues.
15 minutes, maybe?<eos> I arrived first and then Liam arrived about 10 minutes after.<eos> He just had time to down one drink - and then Slauson came in.<eos> - A drink?<eos> I thought you only pretended to drink.
Yes sir.<eos> And General Allen is going to be coming forward today<eos> I want the both of you back here for the General's visit.<eos> We'll take care of the issue in Braunlage and we'll get right back.<eos> Excellent thank you gentlemen dismissed.
To the invisible jet!<eos> - Dang it!<eos> - Every man for himself.<eos> No, we must protect the Piece.<eos> Shaq, do you know what time...
Nice!<eos> We pilot the ship to the service entrance so we can get past the dangerous but also kind of cool laser gate.<eos> Space ID.<eos> I have a drive-on.<eos> Who are you here to see?
Knock it off!<eos> I got enough on my plate without you two horsin' around, you dig?<eos> Uh...<eos> Uh...<eos> Hey, boss, let's show you fellas the basement, huh?
- We're currently renting.<eos> -lt's all just material. Electrons, protons.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> We do. -Technically.<eos> Let me ask you, has your company done business recently with a Mr. Bert Hanson?
Tomorrow.<eos> - Welcome!<eos> - Good evening.<eos> - Six single rooms, thanks.<eos> - Have you booked?
Let's not get into the legality of this.<eos> I've just had a table of four leave before their mains, refusing to pay the bill because of the noise.<eos> Yeah, I'm sorry.<eos> We're very, very sorry.<eos> I think it's time for you to leave, please.
No, thank you.<eos> You worried about your ex? It's okay.<eos> We're not looking at him.<eos> And nobody wants to.<eos> What are you looking for from me?
So, you, uh, waiting for someone?<eos> No.<eos> You and, uh, Marty split prior, right?<eos> In '95?<eos> - Are either of you married?
We're private investigators hired to do, uh, ancestral research, mineral rights along the coast.<eos> Hmm.<eos> I never knew them Turtle people, but I heard stories'<eos> No, thank you.<eos> You think she might get some money out this?
I'll go and see...<eos> You two!<eos> I'm sorry, Camilla. But you're not going to find anything.<eos> Are you Amy Strickland?<eos> Yes, are you the police?
Just one question.<eos> What do you mean by operational expenses?<eos> There are officers outside, the police chief is there.<eos> If someone saw or heard anything, we need to cut them in.<eos> We have to avoid loose ends. So if you're OK...
- Assad.<eos> - Ditlev Pram.<eos> We want to ask about your classmates at Griffen Holm.<eos> Exciting.<eos> Can I offer you something?
Tell him your put-down, Abe. Tell him your put-down.<eos> Well, I was just telling Ed here that your game reminds me of a case of trichomoniasis in an otherwise healthy vagina.<eos> (Both laugh) - I had to agree!<eos> - It's true!<eos> You guys are both hilarious and a pleasure to park near.
The tribe's in good hands. Is it?<eos> No matter what.<eos> That's a promise.<eos> Well, let's not get carried away.<eos> I'll be back before you can burn this place down.
I highly doubt they'll be too keen on sharing it with anyone from The Knick.<eos> Well, then be creative.<eos> Gentlemen.<eos> I take it you're here on behalf of Mr. Collier.<eos> I would really prefer you didn't just appear at my workplace.
There's water, electricity... Anyway...<eos> All the comforts.<eos> - Can I have a look?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Do you know the area?
You could rupture her appendix and kill her.<eos> Nonsense.<eos> If she had appendicitis, she'd have a fever.<eos> Well, something went.<eos> You gentlemen will have to excuse me now.
I'd like to welcome Dr. Thackery to his first board meeting, seated in place of the late Dr. Christiansen.<eos> My condolences, Dr. Thackery.<eos> Dr. Christiansen's untimely passing has brought added strain to The Knickerbocker.<eos> Aside from the public disaster it presents, it further hampers our efforts at financial solidity.<eos> As you can see, gentlemen, in the published reports in front of you, monthly costs have increased.
He's the dick whisperer.<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> Besides, I slept with him last week.<eos> Shut up!<eos> All right, you two. I need you to go down to headquarters.
Why don't you ask us for something more lucrative?<eos> Looks like you don't understand.<eos> Get the NOC...<eos> Sir, greetings!<eos> When did you come?
- Oh, fuck off!<eos> I have moves.<eos> Tom, they only kiss you because you look achievable.<eos> Yeah, that's a move.<eos> Do you guys have a lighter?
This is Dr. Shaf Keshavjee.<eos> Dr. Keshavjee, I've heard so much about you.<eos> It's an honor.<eos> Nice to meet you both.<eos> What are you doing here?
# Flabby Anus!<eos> Flabby Anus!<eos> # You've got a flabby, flabby, flabby anus!<eos> I stand by it, mate.<eos> You live here, do you, lads?
I didn't say anything about a haunted mansion. Did you say anything about a haunted mansion? It was all her.<eos> You want to come after me?<eos> I'll have my people bury you under so much paperwork, you'll be crapping confetti for a week.<eos> [Chuckles] Sounds like a party.<eos> They'll show you out... Counselors. Peter:
- Thanks.<eos> So where are we going?<eos> Why don't we split up.<eos> I'll go here, you go there.<eos> Gentlemen, could you watch the food for a while, please? - No problem.
The Germans got reinforcements.<eos> We expect an assault at any point.<eos> There's an order to move the arm band from left to right!<eos> Everyone take your positions.<eos> You'll finish your soup later, it's better not to eat now.
It's good you are here.<eos> May Allah keep the bride and groom in prosperity, and confer his blessings upon them.<eos> Do you know my uncle, General Tariq?<eos> Good to see you, as always, General.<eos> And you both know my wife, Nadia.
She disappeared from her apartment last night at approximately 9:17 pm.<eos> Her appartment?<eos> In Toronto? She called 911, saying a man was breaking in.<eos> When officers arrived, they found the door forced open and blood.<eos> And why are you here?
I don't blame you, love.<eos> I came back.<eos> I thought you should know why.<eos> I found something.<eos> As you've probably noticed, the gaskets have gone to rot.
Do you know who Courtney Reed is?<eos> I know the name.<eos> She's an old girlfriend of Ned's.<eos> They met at Annapolis.<eos> Why are you asking?
What? Uh, I'm-I'm sure it's nothing but, uh, Angus was clearly quite upset with Colpepper about something.<eos> I don't know what.<eos> I didn't think much about it at the time.<eos> But?<eos> But now you're telling me Colpepper's been murdered.
We'll have to anguish a little in this trough, and that's all, we'll get home.<eos> ¶ God forgive us, your people!<eos> Never mind, let them sing!<eos> Get settled you, and then write to me.<eos> And I will answer for sure! It's for you!
~ September 14th, 1983.<eos> ~ Place of birth?<eos> ~ Flint, Michigan.<eos> ~ Very good.<eos> Where are you flying to today, gentlemen?
- If you insist.<eos> You know, Sam, it was you who insisted on making the reservation.<eos> And where'd you get that silly hat? Oh, why is my hat the default insult? Can thrill me like you do?<eos> Thank you!<eos> But all that tells me is that wherever you guys are from, you lack quality entertainment.
Oh. - Yes, yeah.<eos> The one with the bottle there, she has a drinking problem. That's a binky. It looks like a goatee.<eos> - I got it.<eos> - Our first guests.<eos> Gentlemen, you have definitely outdone yourselves.
No, I was alone.<eos> So you live on your own then?<eos> Yes.<eos> My mother and grandmother just visit me.<eos> Would you like some coffee? , we have some cake?
No shit it'll do.<eos> That baby's my fucking masterpiece.<eos> Could take her through a minefield without a flat tyre.<eos> Cartel!<eos> Easy, hombre. You wouldn't shoot a man in a wheelchair, would you?
Maybe I got it wrong but the address...<eos> The bridge just like I was told.<eos> - Hello! Ooh! Good morning.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> You gentlemen are looking for a quiet spot?
- Well, it's okay.<eos> - Super.<eos> - It's pretty stuffed back there.<eos> - I have the suitcase here in front.<eos> - Where are you going?
This is torture!<eos> Now, go on.<eos> "At the end of the chorus..."<eos> There ought perhaps to have been people in this countryside.<eos> Do you see? Are you making note of it?
Left turn!<eos> Impersonating an officer, however badly, is a grave offence, Private Lomax.<eos> Maybe my sense of humour is not to your taste, but I'd go stark raving mad if I didn't crack some rather bad jokes.<eos> I think it's David Niven, sir.<eos> No, the killing is much better left to someone like you, an officer and just possibly a gentleman!
- Have some, and cut loose.<eos> - Get off! I'm not going to cut loose with you!<eos> - What are you laughing at? - Me? Nothing.<eos> What is it?<eos> I'm sorry, captain, it's funny to see two strong men like you... talking about cutting loose, Valencia cocktail...
- l'm a British citizen.<eos> - Since when?<eos> Since I was born here.<eos> This is not looking good.<eos> Are you gentlemen the musicians?
I mean, the girl, she was...<eos> Are you worried about her?<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> Well, if you're worried about her, Louis, we'll have to find her.<eos> Mr Julian knows you're here. He'll be with you in a moment.
Two fellas from the FBI.<eos> They going' through the drawers now. Mm-hmm. Puttin' papers in file boxes.<eos> Yes, they are takin' things.<eos> Well, they didn't say... Yes, they can.<eos> What did you say your names were?
It was on the news.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> OK. Thanks.<eos> Possible sighting.<eos> Well, if you think of anything else...
Elizabeth, this is Signor Paganini.<eos> Signor Paganini, I am very pleased.<eos> London awaited your arrival.<eos> - This is Signor Urbani.<eos> Did you have a pleasant journey?
I do not know how.<eos> Yesterday, in the club, just go and she's waiting for me at the door.<eos> Dad, there's a man.<eos> - Then, champ.<eos> Better off. You will more broadly.
- Heh. It's just sweet old me, Paula Bean.<eos> I just wanted y'all to taste my new low-fat recipe.<eos> Hey.<eos> Sorry I'm late.<eos> You guys shooting a reality show or something?
Your... decorator?<eos> Get Vincent now.<eos> Can I help you gentlemen?<eos> No, we're good.<eos> No, actually, you're not.
Wonderful choice.<eos> It's very tasteful, yet it has that certain panache.<eos> You David Lerner?<eos> Yes, but... I am with a client right now.<eos> If you wouldn't mind stepping outside for just a few minutes...
Well, get it back.<eos> Chief, we're receiving incoming EHF from EWS Sainte Marina.<eos> Lawrence, what the hell did you do to this thing?<eos> I didn't do anything, man.<eos> It's jammed. You guys, shut up!
You keep calm and reassure the cast and crew.<eos> - Mr. Dodge. - Yes.<eos> - You are?<eos> - Bran McTavish. The director.<eos> Did either of you see Sharon Warwick fall?
What are we waiting for?<eos> To see how much we're gonna charge.<eos> Over here.<eos> Oh, my gosh, I am so glad that you came.
You saying I'm a bad man?<eos> Should I come back later?<eos> Commander Lisa Cleveland. But please...<eos> don't let me interrupt.<eos> Are you sure there hasn't been some kind of mistake?
Damned inconvenient for us.<eos> It's curious, don't you think?<eos> She disappears on one royal occasion and Kendrick is murdered in the middle of another.<eos> This is private property.<eos> What are you doing here?
I might. But perhaps such a thing never crossed my mind.<eos> Perhaps I assume the police know what they're doing.<eos> Prehaps you couldn't give a damn.<eos> Try to involve me or any of my family in this and you'll discover quite how much of a damn I do give.<eos> Well? Are you going to tell me or aren't you?
Paying the company back for how they treated him.<eos> I'm more inclined to an accident.<eos> The safety record here doesn't exact inspire confidence.<eos> What's that in his pocket?<eos> Where did you get this?
My grandfather used to bring me here when I was a kid.<eos> And his grandfather brought him here.<eos> Good day, gentlemen!<eos> Welcome to the Drunken Clam!<eos> Can I get you boys a mug of stout?
If you're down here, you better identify yourself right now!<eos> Dude...<eos> I got a bad feeling about this thing, man.<eos> I-I don't think that we should--<eos> You gents looking for me?
So, existing planning permission...<eos> Who's that?<eos> Gives it an extra 70 square foot, but...<eos> Excuse me? Yeah?<eos> What do you think you're doing?
Sir, this is a cheque for $1.4 million.<eos> That's right.<eos> My boy's a millionaire.<eos> He earned it. The hard way.<eos> And you're sure you wanna deposit it all into a checking account?
Mrs Clarke? Yes?<eos> We've come about the garage to rent.<eos> We rang earlier.<eos> Saw the ad in the newsagents on Castle Road.<eos> Yes. Do you live locally?
It's very good.<eos> Yeah, 2004 was a great year for this wine.<eos> Not so much for me.<eos> Enjoy.<eos> So, did I talk you into that soufflé?
So you operated on Jeremiah Fuller. In that office.<eos> It was his blood we found on the floor.<eos> But the wife wasn't happy, was she?<eos> Nonsense.<eos> Now, gentlemen, if you don't mind...
- It doesn't matter now.<eos> The party died the minute the aerialist fell on big bird.<eos> People see a woman's tibia impale her own foot, it's hard to steer the conversation<eos> - in a different direction. - They're gonna be fine. There's a hospital right down... down the street.<eos> You know what?
I'm thinking it might be a buyer, or she's making a deal.<eos> Find out who's in that room.<eos> I'm sorry, we don't open for another half hour.<eos> We need to talk to Graydon ostler.<eos> Oh, no, you don't understand.
Whoa, look at that.<eos> We better not tell McGee about the Star Trek video game chairs.<eos> It'll just irritate him.<eos> It's like an Apple Store.<eos> You must be NCIS.
Who owns The Paradise?<eos> Is there justice in what you see?<eos> Do you believe life will get easier for any of us while Tom Weston holds the whip?<eos> Especially for Mr Moray.<eos> Can you feel your eyes drawn to it? Like you can't stop looking at it?
They introduced their own.<eos> We can control our actions, Your Honor, but we can not and should not control the actions of our members.<eos> We are not asking them to control anyone but themselves. We ask that they be forced to take down this new thread...<eos> You know, I agree with Mrs. Florrick.<eos> You guys...
Or we could try singing.<eos> Yeah, singing, that's good!<eos> Wow, finally, something in my life that makes me feel special.<eos> I mean, except for when I had those cow udders.<eos> So, as you can see, the fiscal projections for the fourth quarter make this thing a slam dunk.
Spiral.<eos> Eight.<eos> Straighten out.<eos> Good.<eos> Who are you?
How dare you? How dare you?<eos> Come on, Davey, say something.<eos> Let's just fucking shoot everyone.<eos> Let's start with you, eh?<eos> Are you here for the money, then?
We are already taking shots?<eos> I give her a ride home.<eos> See?<eos> And you will not even come tonight -.<eos> I'll see you Monday. .
We've discussed it at length and arrived at a unanimous decision.<eos> We respectfully advise you to relinquish your teaching obligations.<eos> Under no circumstances will I give up my classes.<eos> You may not have enough students who are willing to study with you.<eos> Perhaps you have not been in communication with your own students, but I'm entirely oversubscribed at the moment.
You drove him and waited in the car?<eos> Yeah. How much money did Dominic lend you?<eos> $5,000, but Tobey was going to pay every penny back.<eos> So Tobey didn't use any of that money for drugs.<eos> Drugs-- are you kidding?
If this is still an issue tonight, we'll talk, okay?<eos> Okay. I'll phone a friend.<eos> Sorry about that, I was...<eos> Kobe's having a barbecue this weekend.<eos> You got plans this weekend?
I mean you no harm.<eos> I'm simply a fellow weary traveler.<eos> Good cold evening, gentlemen.<eos> I'm looking for a pair of slave traders that go by the name of the Speck Brothers.<eos> Might that be you?
He's fun.<eos> Trim 5 images from the music.<eos> From everything.<eos> And raise the voices.<eos> You guys are the best.
Lots, sir.<eos> They'd have to know how to use that lift, sir.<eos> We're not breeding them that clever.<eos> Unless they have help.<eos> And you are?
Coulda been...<eos> I'm something.<eos> Yeah...<eos> A Leonard.<eos> You men are here for Juliet?
- Pizza?<eos> - Yeah, pizza.<eos> You want pizza?<eos> I'm so tired of revivals.<eos> Aren't you?
Oh, and your, uh, daughter called.<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I thought you weren't gonna be back till Monday.<eos> Oh, you two have a lot to talk about.
What just happened?<eos> She shot him.<eos> Self-defense?<eos> You murdered him in cold blood. I was watching.<eos> You two warned me. This was a dangerous felon.
You're telling a lawyer joke? Yeah.<eos> No.<eos> Lawrence Dersh.<eos> You're a tough man to find.<eos> You're here about Alton.
White-collar crime.<eos> Fast track to partnership, right, Colette?<eos> Yeah, if you play your cards right.<eos> No, in-house dating, Larry.<eos> Rules. Well, as you can see, Larry's had a few and is saying some inappropriate things.
Yes, sir.<eos> Cameron, show him how it's done.<eos> Dad, you're an asshole.<eos> Sorry to interrupt your family moment.<eos> Who are you?
We hide who we really are in order to be loved and accepted.<eos> Alex and I, we were honest with each other.<eos> So I wouldn't let what you read on Alex's profile color your perception of your time together.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I think what you guys are doing could be called entrapment.
Alex and I, we were honest with each other.<eos> So I wouldn't let what you read on Alex's profile color your perception of your time together.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I think what you guys are doing could be called entrapment.<eos> You're not supposed to put up a fake profile.
We didn't hit it off.<eos> She looked good on paper, but in person, not my type. Where you were Tuesday night around 10:00 p.m.?<eos> 10:00 p.m.? I was in the last lap of the autocross Pro-Am.<eos> Couple hundred witnesses.<eos> Are you guys sure you don't want a lesson?
It's got three games built-in, but you can download more from the website.<eos> I know.<eos> You already have one.<eos> I can always use a backup.<eos> Hi. Can I start you with something to drink?
I applied to NCIS twice. Got shot down both times.<eos> Did you fail the physical?<eos> Miss Baransky.<eos> We're from NCIS. Yes.<eos> I was told you were coming.
Yes, I think you are.<eos> Did you know that Mr. Stiles' last lawyer was a murderer?<eos> Whereas I am not.<eos> And again, this interview is over.<eos> Excellent. Well, uh, if you'll excuse me, always a pleasure.
- You can still smell the perfume.<eos> - Hello?<eos> It appears we've been stood up.<eos> Remus can see that.<eos> If you'll forgive me, I do need to get back to work.
Actually, I've got tickets for a Broadway show tomorrow night.<eos> - Eddie Cantor.<eos> - Lincoln Memorial's finally finished.<eos> I hear it's really something.<eos> You gents with the Chamber of Commerce?
- Who are you?<eos> - I'm Robert Quarles.<eos> - This is Wynn Duffy.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Both of you.
Times have changed, Mr. Kalina.<eos> What do you mean our father's title to the property isn't clear? !<eos> - He got the land in the agrarian reform.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> I'd suggest you clear it up at the municipal office.
You kidding me? Look at him.<eos> So, Samuel Jeffers hasn't paid you a visit?<eos> No, he hasn't contacted me, and I-I would remember him.<eos> I saw him up pretty close.<eos> Why are you here?
I've told you we will figure this out.<eos> - Hi. - Hello. May I help you?<eos> Yeah, you can.<eos> We'd like to talk to your husband.<eos> Excuse me. Who are you? What do you want?
What if I say, "screw you"?<eos> The only person you'd be screwing is your best mate.<eos> Virtually all my detectives have been seconded to the operation.<eos> You've responded decisively, sir.<eos> You two know each other?
Sit your old bones down, nana!<eos> - Hey!<eos> - Give me that!<eos> - Guys?<eos> You guys, no, come on, this is crazy. Please don't! - Stop it!
He and I are getting very close to the edge of things these days.<eos> Vince?<eos> That's odd.<eos> Let me do the talking.<eos> Are you the police?
Very much.<eos> Lord Grantham, I believe.<eos> The same.<eos> Looking for a Mr Alfred Nugent, my lord.<eos> And you are...?
That's four. Questions, because yours was a two...<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> And all of them very good.<eos> It's just that we're in the answer business.<eos> So, Mr. Callen, Mr. Hanna, I've informed Stone's supervisor that you'll be paying him a visit at the Naval Lab.
You guys can go.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Can I have my...<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> May I ask what you're searching for?
We saw him here. I told him to stop robbing other kids.<eos> And he went nuts.<eos> What are you, vigilantes?<eos> You're harassing us.<eos> You harassed two young immigrants.
You coming with me, Rockefeller?<eos> Come meet someone, let's go!<eos> Hello, Mrs. Rosario.<eos> Good day.<eos> Are you also headed to Istanbul?
Shouldn't they stay on the other side of the fence?<eos> Monika, please take Grandma inside.<eos> She can watch television, or read yesterday's Keyhole.<eos> Mr. Chancellor, this is Jack, the well-known reporter, and this is Bob, who's going to take a few pictures.<eos> May I ask which paper you work for?
Glad none of us know who the shooter is.<eos> Listen, if you think we're gonna believe that this is all just a big coincidence we're gonna be here for a long time.<eos> Okay, wait.<eos> By saying "we're gonna be here for a long time" you're implying that we're not allowed to leave which would only be the case if we were under arrest.<eos> Well, then, ipso facto you don't have sufficient evidence constituting probable cause for an arrest warrant.
Penny Dessertine's sister, right?<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> Uh, we'd just like to ask you a few questions.<eos> Look, the cops already came by.<eos> I'm tired. So, if you don't mind...
Am I right?<eos> Agent.<eos> I wasn't expecting you...yet.<eos> Well, apparently, you didn't get the call.<eos> Gentlemen, can you excuse us?
There'll be no trouble here, boys.<eos> Ah, we ain't lookin' for any trouble, Sheriff.<eos> Ain't that right, John?<eos> Nah, just commentin' on how different he looks.<eos> What is it that you boys want?
Look, you're sick and you need help and I will do everything within my power to help you get help.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you all.<eos> You guys are doing an excellent, an excellent job here and I really appreciate it.
It's iron.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> - Keep going.<eos> - The rod will heat up.<eos> Why don't you do something?
- To use this as an opportunity to stir up anti-American sentiment and sell more newspapers or blogs or what-have- you... is, quite frankly, inappropriate and counterproductive.<eos> When things fall out of the sky, Mr. Montag... they don't care about borders or sovereignty.<eos> The danger is indiscriminate.<eos> And it is precisely because of the relationship between Canada and the United States that we were able to respond as quickly and effectively as we did.<eos> I'm afraid that's going to have to be the last words for right now, so we can go to commercial but I do hope you both will stay with us so that we can continue this... spirited debate
Mr Bates!<eos> You all right, Mrs Patmore?<eos> I'm all right.<eos> There are two men waiting for you in the servants hall.<eos> Are you looking for me?
Just to let you know, I'm not getting out of the car today.<eos> It's brutal out here.<eos> Just a minute.<eos> Excuse me!<eos> I am a police officer, and I have cause to believe you may have contracted the zombie virus.
You're still a cock.<eos> Can I drive?<eos> No.<eos> Get the defib! OK.<eos> I think you may be too late...
11:10 p.m.<eos> 5 minutes after he punched me in the face.<eos> And a half hour after he was driving?<eos> O-objection!<eos> Mr. Bash, would you care to tell me what you're doing before I hold you and your colleague in contempt?
It speaks to the psychology of the driver, Rahim Benghazi.<eos> Overruled.<eos> Answer Mr. Santana's question.<eos> 8:40.<eos> So unless Mr. Benghazi made up for that lost time, you were going to be late for that meeting, correct?
That is fresh.<eos> This is so not the first time that you've done this, is it?<eos> Gently place it over intake manifold...<eos> Braced on there correctly.<eos> You guys, I think we are all set there.
I believe her name is Elizabeth.<eos> Do you believe you know her last name or her address?<eos> It should be in the system.<eos> Let me check.<eos> Would either of you like a glass of champagne or wine while you wait?

Whoa, Kanye!<eos> What's with the big-time entrance?<eos> I'm about to ask Chelsea to the dance.<eos> Thought I should arrive in style.<eos> If you boys'll excuse me.
Teaching?<eos> School!<eos> I've never missed school!<eos> I think we can all agree that anyone would have ended up in the same situation if their son had gone to school on Skip Day.<eos> So, what do you say?
Don't worry Tom, the bank will help us.<eos> - Superintendent.<eos> - Mary.<eos> - A little bit of trouble.<eos> - More than a bit. Can I expect you'll catch the culprit before he strikes again?

That's all right.<eos> - Is this good?<eos> - Yes. Thank you.<eos> ...Mr. Packer's defense attorney never availed himself of mitigation witnesses during the penalty phase of the trial.<eos> As you can see, there are many people here who would speak to Mr. Packer's... fine character.

I really want it. CHRISTIAN:<eos> Sure, we can have it...<eos> [DAN GRUNTING] I should have warned you.<eos> Self-mutilation is a primary manifestation of the disorder.<eos> You probably noticed that with his lips already.

He still is my son, Agent Gibbs.<eos> Fathers do what they have to do for their children.<eos> This is my problem.<eos> He will be dealt with most severely, I assure you.<eos> Now, if you'll excuse me.
Now, obviously, that was left by the real killer.<eos> And the jury agreed with me.<eos> Yes.<eos> How convenient.<eos> Ah, well, you know,
I think someone tried to steal my TV.<eos> And it looks like they dropped it And then ran out the back door.<eos> The only item missing from your home Was an ez-steam humidifier, correct?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm actually surprised you came.
I'm still here.<eos> I haven't found anything. Nothing relevant, anyway, but I'll keep in touch. Okay, bye.<eos> You must be Agent Parker.<eos> I understand you're investigating Jonas Lester's death.<eos> And you are...?
- Hello.<eos> - And you must be David.<eos> - We're set up in the conference room.<eos> I've got a surprise for you.<eos> Do you believe in fate?
All right, let me just get into character.<eos> I'm a bit distracted.<eos> I wasn't expecting we'd do this today - in light of the circumstances.<eos> - What circumstances?<eos> Oh, dear God, didn't you hear?
Just give me a second.<eos> I'm sure you're aware there are restrictions On the import of certain foreign foods and spirits.<eos> We'll need to search everything.<eos> Whoa, whoa, wait a minute.<eos> What are you doing?
The kid is even refusing his doctor-ordered pain meds far as we can tell.<eos> So where do we go from here?<eos> A couple of gentlemen from OPR will come down probably tomorrow morning.<eos> Janice will give us an exact time.<eos> And you men will be continuing your investigation, so...
Sam, good, you're here. Come on in.<eos> I thought you wanted to go over the quarterly inventory.<eos> Yes, but then some old friends dropped by.<eos> Sam Allen, I would like you to meet Detective Turner and Sergeant Clemente.<eos> - So, you're policemen?
Okay, okay.<eos> See you later. Bye. Bye-bye.<eos> Ma'am?<eos> Agents.<eos> What are you doing here?
Did you find out what happened?<eos> The dead body is Harriet Soloway!<eos> Harriet?<eos> My God! I thought she was at the Cocoa Bean Symposium in Baltimore. So did I.<eos> Right. So, when was the last time you saw her?
Simran, I think you should invite these gentlemen to leave.<eos> We only need a few more minutes, Mrs. Verma.<eos> If you don't want them here, you can ask them to leave, Simran.<eos> Gentlemen...<eos> Would you please leave?
Now, I want you to go on upstairs, all right?<eos> Go on, sugar.<eos> Scoot.<eos> Oh, I am so sorry Y'all had to come all the way out here.<eos> Can I get you a cold glass of water or something?
Target's on the first floor.<eos> I'm here if there's any resistance.<eos> Stay here.<eos> Keep the engine running.<eos> Any time you guys want to break that safe distance you're maintaining, I'd appreciate it.
They gambled, skied, chased women together.<eos> DiNozzo was hanging around the corporate terminal in Geneva, looking for a ride.<eos> I checked with Jonathon.<eos> He said it was fine.<eos> So, the last time you saw Iverson, he was with DiNozzo?
"You save someone's life<eos> "And you are responsible for him until his death. " Not sure I understand.<eos> It's too twisted for me.<eos> It's like this rotten world in which we live.<eos> You live in autarky? We live not in autarky, we are self-sufficient, eh, Walt?
Just tell her to meet us at the museum first thing in the morning.<eos> Told you he wouldn't be up; he's never up early on<eos> Saturdays.<eos> So we should have an hour with Maggie at the museum before it opens and...<eos> Where do you think you're going?
Kenny. I've found my place, Stevie.<eos> If you don't like it, you can leave.<eos> I intend to enjoy myself.<eos> Yup, this is the spot.<eos> You gents ever hit this shit?
Hello, what can I do for you?<eos> What can you do for me? I'm looking for a gentleman that was just brought in.<eos> Probably into ICU.<eos> Where might I find him?<eos> You wanna go straight down the hall, to your right... Make a left, two rights and another left. And you'll be right there.
Okay, let's go! Look at this!<eos> Let's move, let's move.<eos> Come on.<eos> Whoo, whoo, whoo.<eos> Step up, will you?
I n your own words, what happened?<eos> The Shithead and the Asswipe were here.<eos> All night.<eos> They had TV dinners.<eos> I guess the real question is, do you have the bowling ball?
Tomorrow, we'll find somebody who works upstairs in those rooms, okay?<eos> How's it going, fellows?<eos> - Yeah, we're good, thanks.<eos> Very good. - Glad to hear it.<eos> I'm hoping you could help me out.
Hello, gentlemen, and welcome to the Salmon Slammin'.<eos> My name is Donnie.<eos> Can I start you off with something to drink tonight?<eos> We've already got some drinks, haven't we, mate?<eos> Sounds like you're from the UK.

To mothers.<eos> What line of work you in, Mr. Button?<eos> Buttons. Button's Buttons. There isn't a button that we don't make.<eos> Our biggest competition is B. F. Goodrich and his infernal zippers. Would you gentlemen like anything else? One for the road, Benjamin?<eos> Only if you let me pay for it, Mr. Button.
What could I do?<eos> They wouldn't have caught that taxi, had it not been for you!<eos> - Take good care of Astrid now...<eos> Hey, where's our dessert?<eos> I'm sorry, we don't serve what you've requested.
What do you say?<eos> You, me, this apartment.<eos> Let's get sick of each other.<eos> Okay.<eos> As you can see, the restaurant would be elegant.
My favorite kind.<eos> Thank you, Joan.<eos> Shall I give you the threepenny tour?<eos> Please let everyone know that they're here.<eos> We have you scheduled to meet with Sterling, Cooper and Draper, and then with Mr. Pryce, of course, and then a light lunch in the conference room with the personnel you requested.
Bones, it's weird!<eos> Now how is it any more odd than, say, shaving your face or putting on makeup?<eos> I'm not hanging up because I don't have an answer to that, I'm just hanging up.<eos> But...<eos> So, we understand that you and the deceased had an altercation over your dog?
I was amused that he hated the country that kept him gainfully employed.<eos> That's one of my big complaints with the mujahideen.<eos> No sense of irony.<eos> Unfortunately, the same could be said for my clients.<eos> If you'll excuse me.
No, what my brother means is it would be a shame if...<eos> - Oh, sorry, Colonel!<eos> - Don't worry about that. - Please, do sit down.<eos> - No, we prefer to stand, thank you.<eos> - All right, but what do you want?
I am sorry.<eos> - Excuse me, ma'am.<eos> I am a doctor by profession too.<eos> Then you very well know what I am saying.<eos> You both can meet him if you want.
Running away from the FBI is always suspicious.<eos> I'm Canadian.<eos> My work visa expired a week ago.<eos> I thought you were gonna ship me back to Sudbury.<eos> Have you ever been to Sudbury? You would've ran, too.

Graphite shaft, nothing too heavy.<eos> And $1 million worth of high-grade pharmaceuticals stolen off a freighter a couple of days ago.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> I sell golf equipment.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.
So we're walking in the park after lunch, and he sees these birds picking seeds out of some horse shit, and he says, "Move over, fellows. That's my job."<eos> That sounds like a visit from the stork or De Beers.<eos> Or it could be just a new hairdo.<eos> Mr. Rumsen, Mr. Draper.<eos> How are you this morning?
Give me 5 bucks.<eos> No. Sorry. Don.<eos> Can I help you gentlemen?<eos> Swordfish.<eos> And who are you here to see?
yes, Siegi!<eos> Siegi, Siegi, Siegi, Siegi! The boy is diabetic.<eos> He's not the slightest use under any circumstances.<eos> The young man makes a healthy impression, sir .. Do you not think, Professor?<eos> You, you, you , You, you and you ... are now exempt from tuition!
The Americans will be coming across the bridge.<eos> Got it? Yes sir, General!<eos> One goes there with a bazooka. He can lay down in position under the trees over there.<eos> And after the shot withdraw, move to the MG.<eos> What are you waiting for? or do you all need written invertations?
Jackson, call the Marshall's office.<eos> I want checkpoints here, here, and here.<eos> 15-mile radius.<eos> Captain.<eos> Lieutenant, nice of you to join us.
Mrs Caroline Arless?<eos> I'm herself, and simply oozing' with goodness.<eos> I'm here on behalf of Her Majesty the Queen to serve you with a summons for the non-payment of debts.<eos> You took the beer, you drank it, and now you're going to pay for it.<eos> Well, since you're here, can you lend me tuppence till I treat my little uns to a fish dinner?
The dog was choking!<eos> He'll run off again.<eos> Just close the doors.<eos> So do it.<eos> When will you finish?
- You gotta do something.<eos> - What am I suppose to do?<eos> They came to see video-game greatness, someone better deliver.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, our...<eos> Gentlemen, let me introduce you to the challenger.
That's Pookie.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Officer Spencer.<eos> Long time no see.<eos> What brings you gentlemen to my establishment?
What'd you think I meant?<eos> Nothing. [ Chuckles ]<eos> Now,that brings back memories.<eos> Dude,I need a bigger kiln.<eos> You gentlemen wanted to talk to me?
17 years is a long time to go between visits.<eos> Not long enough.<eos> The kid's still angry. Yeah,i'm starting to get that.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Here you go. You from the fbi?
Colonel, there are some officers here demanding to take Bridget Sullivan into custody.<eos> Matter of time.<eos> Find her and sequester her in my office.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> You gentlemen here to see me?
- I thought this was the appropriate branch of the department. - Oh, dear.<eos> Jenkins, take this gentleman down to Mr Tite Barnacle Junior in the Applications Department.<eos> Good day to you, Mr Clennam.<eos> Excuse me, gentlemen but this is Mr Dorrit's bench, the Father of the Marshalsea.<eos> At other times, you're welcome to it, of course. Sure that's understood.
- Where?<eos> Next to the further beech tree!<eos> Get Down.<eos> THE RED BARON<eos> Are you out of your bloody mind?
You are a real hero.<eos> I take it the ladies're all over you.<eos> There aren't many ladies at 10,000 feet, your Majesty.<eos> Corp, attention!<eos> Well, are you ready, gentlemen?
Those crazy Negroes.<eos> Enter.<eos> Pardon me, General. Your meeting is about to start.<eos> - #Take me from behind # - Yeah.<eos> So, as you can see, generals, Deathco Amalgamated's M-47 "Jumpin' Johnny" land mine... earned a triple-A rating in field trials and boasts a 98% kill-through ratio... making it the best land mine for the government's dollar.
We thought there will be like 5 of them but they have the whole regimnet there.<eos> Don't whine!<eos> Even if they had a whole army in there you would act like a chicken.<eos> - Are you talking about counterfeit money? - Yes, exactly.<eos> And you'd probably like to check my safe.
All of them have gone because they were easy. Don't feel too happy.<eos> Let's see if you pot the black one.<eos> I told you it won't go!<eos> - It did. - Oh no..<eos> I knew Rocky was going to win. Thank you, brother. You helped me win.
- And you get out of here. Get out! I said, get out of here.<eos> And don't ever dare to show your face here.<eos> Sir, give AP an opportunity to clarify his stand. I had given him this opportunity only on your behest.<eos> What difference did it make?<eos> Thank you! Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you!
Oh oh I'm startin' to feel really dizzy. Break his neck! Come on!<eos> - Call it off? - No!<eos> No. OK.<eos> I gotta give these people a show.<eos> Are you guys ready?
What's hummus!<eos> It's a very tasty diarrhea-like substance.<eos> Grant Walbridge has a vision.<eos> A vision for Lower Manhattan to have the first indoor mall with its own 300-foot roller coaster.<eos> You know, you're lucky I have a world-class superhot girlfriend with a perfectly proportioned ass-to-breast ratio or I'd be furious.
Colonel.<eos> Attention!<eos> Gentlemen.<eos> For our first order of business, General Fromm will present his plans for the reallocation of troops from the Reserve Army on the eastern front.<eos> Now, as you know, last night the Russians launched a new offensive against Army Group North Ukraine in the South Poland section.
–Katie Lloyd.<eos> –Pleasure.<eos> First, let me say, Mr Morris, we are happy for your recovery.<eos> I've met with the district attorney.<eos> I suspect she'd agree not to prosecute on the cheque forging if you agree not to press charges.
- No?<eos> Reeks of desperation.It's a deal breaker.Trust me.<eos> You know what?<eos> I can't take this anymore.<eos> You guys are kidding yourselves.
Even if he has to be rude.<eos> The problem is, I'm not for sale, honey...<eos> Not to God and not to you.<eos> Now, I have to go to the girl's room.<eos> If you excuse me.
He spoke very god French, but with an English accent.<eos> "I don't see why I should shake the hand of a crook like you."<eos> I stood up and swore.<eos> "Jesus Christ, I'm no crook!"<eos> "But you, with your dollars, just corrupt the whole world...
I stood up and swore.<eos> "Jesus Christ, I'm no crook!"<eos> "But you, with your dollars, just corrupt the whole world...<eos> "...and cause all the wars.<eos> You're the real crooks."
In all probability, he's dead like them.<eos> Of course, the company's not gonna pay off on his policy until the police find a body, so his wife's been struggling to keep her head above water.<eos> I'm surprised they didn't just cancel her insurance and put the final nail in her coffin.<eos> Sounds like you don't approve of how things are done around here.<eos> Who'd you say you work for, again?
Along with a quote on a tarot card.<eos> Locked in ritual.<eos> Poetry on tarot cards.<eos> In English, in Greek.<eos> He's not giving you guys any clues.
Are the Horses safe with this crew?<eos> Of, course, as far as they know they're just delivering cars.<eos> Stay calm and cooperate.<eos> It's just a routine check.<eos> I need you out of the car, both of you.
They got valet.<eos> I know a garage on 51st.<eos> It's half the price.<eos> I'll meet you guys up in the room.<eos> Are you gentlemen in town for business or pleasure?
I apologize for any perceived insult,Mr.--<eos> Sergeant booker of the south philadelphia constabulary.<eos> Several of your neighbors professed to hearing screams two nights ago.<eos> Two nights ago.<eos> Well,I have been writing,and as you've seen, when I am engaged in acts of the imagination, I have little sense of the world around me. Such is my genius.
Because of the eyes thing.<eos> You've got massive eyes.<eos> - Sorry, can I help you?<eos> - Yes, we're here to pitch a movie.<eos> - Right. Do you have an appointment?
What's the matter with you?<eos> You behave like a child.<eos> You're playing detective, without realizing the consequences.<eos> Do everyone a big favour and... Go stay in your room.<eos> - Aren't you staying for dinner?
Diazepam?<eos> Drop it.<eos> -You, hold it.<eos> -Hold it!<eos> You're neighbors of the deceased?
-Hold it!<eos> You're neighbors of the deceased?<eos> -We didn't kill her.<eos> -l hope not.<eos> Well, it's evident that you're homosexuals but, of any specific type?
What's that got to do with the deceased?<eos> -Luis, wait in the car, please.<eos> -But, mom...<eos> The car!<eos> When did you see her last?
That pawn ticket of Greely's.<eos> That was for a ring, wasn't it?<eos> - Hello?<eos> Hello? Is it a repair?<eos> Or are you looking to buy?
Maybe Greely lied to the journalist about dying and was running a scam or something.<eos> Maybe.<eos> All I know is, when I told Linn, I couldn't have got a bigger reaction if I'd hit him with a sledgehammer.<eos> Why would that be?<eos> Why do you want to see him?
The number's 993-817.<eos> What does it mean?<eos> We think the Son Of The Twice Born she's referring to is Dean Greely, and that he'd been talking to the journalist about the group.<eos> We think your husband killed Greely because of what he revealed.<eos> No, you must be mistaken.
- I just need 5 minutes. Let's go.<eos> Dr. Sandström, I'd like to introduce you to Titus Muyerbridge, from Auflander Docheimer Industries.<eos> Pleasure, Dr. Sandström.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - You know each other?
No dessert for me.<eos> - I'm full.<eos> - Yeah, me too, I'm completely stuffed.<eos> You don't get this figure by eating desserts.<eos> You gentlemen will want this, huh?
I apologize, Dr. Fenton.<eos> I didn't realize you were in another meeting.<eos> - I'll return shortly.<eos> - No, no, Mr. Eischel!<eos> These men are here for you.
- What?<eos> Just kidding!<eos> I'm Kate. Nice to meet you.<eos> Nice to meet you, Kate.<eos> And you guys, who are you?
- We don't care why you're here.<eos> We only care whether your evidence and material amount to anything.<eos> The rest is your problem.<eos> Perhaps at the desk I can get an employment...<eos> You are about to witness for approximately 61 cents of ordinary household materials the perfect homemade silencer.
- Calm. Deep breaths.<eos> This is going to be fabulous.<eos> We're going to do a wonderful show.<eos> For once in your life, Jen, I think you're right.<eos> I want you to give the warm reception you gave the others to our final couple.
But please, I beg of you, do this for me.<eos> Make him eat some of his pets. - Oh, I rather like them.<eos> - I like them too.<eos> In brandy sauce.<eos> - If you'll excuse me...
- Nicholas Garrigan.<eos> His doctor.<eos> - His doctor?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - And you are?
- Why?<eos> We'd like another drink.<eos> - What's the problem?<eos> - We need a bottle of schnapps.<eos> We can't serve you when you're so drunk.
Do you guys believe in destiny?<eos> Well, I do.<eos> I believe destiny brought us to this club tonight.<eos> I believe that you two guys have been destined to perform together.<eos> I believe that together, boys, you will take this town by storm.
Prendergast. Downtown Robbery.<eos> Let's go.<eos> I'm in linoleum tile, myself. All right.<eos> You, back in your vehicle.<eos> You push. I'll steer.
- Why not?<eos> - Metrorail construction, that's why not.<eos> Go around.<eos> Just follow your tootsies.<eos> You sure you don't want something?
- Something wrong?<eos> Since my wife will be giving birth soon and...<eos> It's all right, take the afternoon off.<eos> Go and see your missus.<eos> Do you mind?
She means everything in the world to me.<eos> And if you're going to stand in the way of me trying to win her back, you'd better bring a pretty big candlestick.<eos> Carl?<eos> Hey, Carl.<eos> You... Will you all excuse us?
And on occasion, we do more than think.<eos> - Any thoughts on this?<eos> - We contract to the Pentagon, Detective.<eos> As I'm sure you can imagine, we have a long list of enemies.<eos> Great, well, we'd love to get a statement from you outside.
All of them?<eos> All of them.<eos> But why you wouldn't rather talk to them one at a time is beyond me.<eos> I told you mother this way it will be easier to weed out the unlikelys.<eos> Hello, I'm Penelope. And you must be? Late for tea?
Get out!<eos> Move on.<eos> FREE PASS<eos> DAY 1<eos> You're making a mistake!
Frak!<eos> I'm hit!<eos> Starbuck!<eos> I'm hit, I'm hit, I'm hit! See, Beano opened fire too early.<eos> You guys, you've gotta fill the windscreen with the sucker or you're not going to hit him.
- Yeah. Okay, but... You cannot tell anyone, not even your priest.<eos> - I don't go to church. - Oh, you don't say.<eos> How's that for creative bookkeeping?<eos> Come here.<eos> If you'll excuse me, I, uh... I see a client.
The kid's running a little casino out of here.<eos> Probably uses it to practice.<eos> Practice? Practice what?<eos> Your son plays an awful lot of blackjack, ma'am.<eos> What are you talking about?
- Did anyone hear that Yma Sumac scream when the ceiling fan came down? That was Ron.<eos> The goddamn thing almost killed me.<eos> Fucking nancies.<eos> Don't argue now.<eos> You know, guys, we've got to get serious about the state muster next month. Last year Hinsdale whipped our butt in that ladder carry.
The journalism teacher who died in the bus crash... that give you pause?<eos> Not a moment's.<eos> You know something that makes you so certain?<eos> I know the quality of his character.<eos> Um... there's something you gentlemen should probably see.
Forgive me, gentlemen, but last I checked, the department had a black commissioner and a black l.I.D. director.<eos> The problem is systemic.<eos> And as to Commissioner Burrell-- we understand that his authority is now limited.<eos> Mr. Mayor, when it comes to matters like this one, do you expect us to have faith in Deputy Rawls?<eos> I expect you'll be good enough not to prejudge the department's response before the investigation even begins, as I won't prejudge it.
- That's an order.<eos> - Lieutenant.<eos> I got $235 if it helps. How would that help?<eos> Maybe we can get a foster spot like that. Pay somebody. This is tracking, plain and simple.<eos> To any parent who complains, you're still segregating them.
She has come this way.<eos> It is your imagination, you must have seen someone else.<eos> Come, sir. This is your seat.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Mr. Rahul, sir. - How do you do?
We're about 3 doors down.<eos> Look, that's Yumi's camry pulling out, right there.<eos> What do you want me to do?<eos> Turn around and follow him.<eos> You guys, be advised, we have an unidentified white male subject driving the victim's car from the house.
These guys really clean up after themselves.<eos> And we've got nothing again.<eos> That's not completely true.<eos> I always do a set of polaroids, just in case.<eos> I'll be in my office when you're finished.
Same on my end.<eos> Really?<eos> go from security level B to level C.<eos> Hey!<eos> Who are you people with?
She's been very lucky to have such a good and faithful servant.<eos> Very lucky indeed.<eos> - Now, if we could see...<eos> - This way, doctors.<eos> As you can see doctors, the case is quite severe.
What are you talking about?<eos> You are some of my most important customers.<eos> Why are you so nervous?<eos> Hurry up and get our drinks.<eos> Would you excuse me?
- Thirty times might make you seem crazy. - Yeah, or just...<eos> Or just plain stupid.<eos> Because you'd think by the 20th time, I would've found an alternative method... or maybe a more effective one.<eos> - Morning, gentlemen.<eos> How you doing today?
- We've got it fucking made!<eos> - I know.<eos> I can actually see Exterminating Angels becoming a phenomenon.<eos> That's for sure. If we haven't got phenomena potential, then I don't know who has.<eos> Either of you boys have any cash on you?
-That's right.<eos> I'm Mr. lchinowa, and this is my colleague...<eos> ... YokoTakanoshi.<eos> Right on.<eos> You said you were Japanese?
Right.<eos> That's my name.<eos> -Thought it might be drugs or something.<eos> -l think I know what it is.<eos> Are you really with Kamasaka Technologies?
I can't really talk right now.<eos> I'm kind of tied up. One, two.<eos> On three.<eos> Men will rotate to the left at the buzzer.<eos> You get two minutes each, four minutes total.
Seems she wanted to be buried in Africa.<eos> Darling Tessa. Hmm.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Excuse me. Excuse me.<eos> What are you doing?
Well, perhaps I asked a policeman.<eos> Can you tell me what I'm doing here, please?<eos> We've been asked to... keep you here.<eos> Right. Help us help you.<eos> I'm sorry. Could you explain?
I forgot the number.<eos> Find the number.<eos> You look like shit.<eos> Thank you. Big day!<eos> Are you ready, gentlemen?
Cause tonight me and Bevins aren't letting' anybody slide on anything.<eos> Anything to drink, officer?<eos> Yeah, I'll have one of those.<eos> Damn, that is a good cup of coffee.<eos> Well, you have a good night, officers.
- the FBI.<eos> Sometimes heard of us?<eos> Where are your papers?<eos> Your identity papers?<eos> Have you that note don't receive?
Not that it's any of your concern, but I was at the Hilton last night on business.<eos> We both were.<eos> And neither of us left the hotel.<eos> Would you like to see our bill?<eos> It's a bit unorthodox but if you wouldn't mind.
We're the ones asking the questions.<eos> Just give me my money and we can get out of here.<eos> Well, then nothing...until you prove to us this canister... is the real thing.<eos> Well, that's impossible.<eos> You gentlemen will just have to take my word for it.
Like we agreed.<eos> We take them when they come out.<eos> Hello, who do you want to see?<eos> Him.<eos> - You've got an appointment?
Good evening, gentlemen.<eos> - Good evening, Mrs Stanley.<eos> - Good evening. You should really not come here.<eos> Cannot a lady visit her husband in his place of work?<eos> You men wait outside.
Would you be interested in God's help?<eos> Good.<eos> - He can't open the box without me.<eos> - Which is why you must die.<eos> Excuse me, all you taxi drivers. I need some assistance.
Well, probably Sophi, Jenni...<eos> I'd say Belli, Cami.<eos> Cami?<eos> Yeah, she gets 2 points for being a teenage virgin.<eos> You boys have hurt Cami's feeling.
- Everybody knows that.<eos> - Excuse me. Is there a problem here?<eos> - He's harassing me.<eos> - He's guilty of overparenting.<eos> If you two can't keep it down, I'm going to throw both of you out.
Angela... really. I feel terrible, leaving you like that.<eos> Andre... go to the bar.<eos> I don't want to spend the night here, okay?<eos> I'm off to the bar, now. Go!<eos> Thank you, sir.
The Fish<eos> 12 hours after the murder<eos> I don't feel like we're very welcomed here.<eos> We're never welcomed.<eos> Oh, there you are...
Nor do we wear waders.<eos> Milord, we've just spent the last two days in your rivers, in your countryside.<eos> It is the most spectacular nature I have ever seen.<eos> And the fish, they're enough to make one believe in a higher power.<eos> Yes. How many of the higher power's creations did you torture?
Huge.<eos> You just found the connection between Darius and Alexa.<eos> Detective Taylor, NYPD. This is Detective Flack.<eos> We're here to see Dr. Feldstein right now.<eos> He's with a client. You can't go in.
You should know, sir, that we only found half the money.<eos> Where's the other half?<eos> Sarah.<eos> Who have you got mixed up with this time?<eos> I'm sorry, you can't go in there.
And that always ends well.<eos> This works out nice.<eos> We got room in the trunk?<eos> Brian McCormick?<eos> You the detectives that called?
With Mom. Was she mad?<eos> I mean, of course she was mad, but was it a bad mad?<eos> Well, you know your mother, Rory. Everything's the end of the world! So dramatic.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, Lorelai Barrymore.<eos> But don't you worry. She'll calm down, just give it some time. Hello?
Some of them even continued to fight!<eos> And that, my friends, is fucking patriotism.<eos> The chemical responsible was later distilled and is now used in carefully conducted scientific experiments under the strictest of legal supervision...<eos> Well... almost!<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, I give you...
Stop it, please!<eos> Listen to me!<eos> You're making a terrible mistake!<eos> Welcome back, Beverly. That'll be all, gentlemen.<eos> Thank you.
- Yeah.<eos> Uh, he never went to any games or anything, if that's what you mean.<eos> Why do you ask?<eos> It's just a little survey I'm doing.<eos> You gentlemen are gonna have to leave this office.
Well, you are one ofthe most articulate ofour focus groupees.<eos> That's... Yeah...<eos> Not groupie, groupees with two Es.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - You're very kind, thanks.
Knowing his own locker contained stolen goods,<eos> Groning came up with an ingenious way out of his predicament.<eos> The Gestapo had sealed the front of his locker, so Groning simply took off the back.<eos> I went to the Gestapo and said,<eos> "Look, what nonsense are you up to, I can't get into my locker."
Five minutes. Then bring them back.<eos> Why five minutes?<eos> Got to put my visage back on. They want the illusion, not some green room hermaphrodite.<eos> - This, Tommy, is why I deserve a share. - Oh, no.<eos> What are you two talking about?
-Mr. Mayor.<eos> -Alex, we heard.<eos> Are you all right? .<eos> -I'm fine.<eos> Finish what you were doing.
Thank you.<eos> Here you go.<eos> - I can help you.<eos> - Thank you, my adjutant will.<eos> Gentlemen, you don't have to wait for me.
Send to Fromm's cabinet.<eos> I'm looking for Colonel Stauffenberg.<eos> That's me.<eos> SS Brigadier Pifrader from the Main Reich Safety Office.<eos> You're from Gestapo?
Made quite a killing yourself, I'll wager.<eos> So shoot me.<eos> Forgive me for prying, but I get the feeling... there was little or no risk in this particular investment.<eos> No risk whatsoever.<eos> So, if you'll excuse me, gentlemen, I do have a meeting.
Can somebody get that?<eos> God forbid anybody should help around here.<eos> Mrs. Helen Girardi?<eos> Yes.<eos> Oh, you must be looking for Will...
You're on nightwatch.<eos> - Nightwatch?<eos> - The Arctic is a dangerous place.<eos> Whatever you do, don't fall asleep.<eos> As you know, Howard and Vince have disappeared.
Whatever you do, don't fall asleep.<eos> As you know, Howard and Vince have disappeared.<eos> They were great keepers and will be difficult to replace.<eos> But we must try.<eos> What qualifications do you two feel you have to work here at the zoo?
Waitress!<eos> Betty, hon, you want to take table number five?<eos> I'm busy.<eos> Sure, Deb.<eos> What can I get for you gents?
We're going back out tomorrow.<eos> Don't you worry.<eos> I'll get him back in the groove.<eos> I'm gonna have my dinner upstairs, okay?<eos> You gentlemen enjoy yourselves.
Maybe it's Litzi.<eos> Maybe they've dug up my marriage to a Communist.<eos> - Relax.<eos> It'll be fine. - How the hell do you know?<eos> - You know each other?
Namely, how did the thieves gain access to this highly secure environment... and then escape with the jewels afterwards?<eos> A simple question, but one which I believe has a complex answer.<eos> - Actually, sir...<eos> - Uh, please, Bough. My mind is at work.<eos> Now, what you must grasp, gentlemen, is that the master criminal... sees not a room but a series of opportunities.
Please be clear. I have never taken my duties lightly but I have no greater duty than to my home, to Virginia.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> Gentlemen, if you are going to succeed at this institution you have one common goal: To learn your lessons.<eos> If you are placing your energies elsewhere you will not succeed either with me or in your careers as military officers.<eos> I had hoped you'd see that with a proper grasp of the artillery principles I've laid before you today, you would learn to apply these principles with great effectiveness in your field experiences.
Thank you, sir.<eos> Gentlemen, if you are going to succeed at this institution you have one common goal: To learn your lessons.<eos> If you are placing your energies elsewhere you will not succeed either with me or in your careers as military officers.<eos> I had hoped you'd see that with a proper grasp of the artillery principles I've laid before you today, you would learn to apply these principles with great effectiveness in your field experiences.<eos> But since you seem unable to grasp these principles I'm forced to conclude I must repeat this lesson tomorrow, word for word.
I never seen you walk in your life when you didn't have to. Nor me, neither.<eos> What man in his senses would cross his street when he could just be sitting on his front porch?<eos> I done more walking this week than in my life and my daddy's life put together.<eos> Who'll give us fresh shoes when these are but tatters and old bits of laces?<eos> You'll excuse me, gentlemen.
He's been handling Miss Selkirk's accounts and trading interests for some time.<eos> Well, perhaps we could...<eos> Are you telling me that the bank would be happy to lend the money to my father, but has reservations about lending it to me? We'd just be happier if Selkirk International was involved - as security.<eos> - I thought security was... The building itself, with Miss Selkirk's bond holdings making up the balance.<eos> In addition to which you have my client's personal guarantee.
- She looked a bit disheveled. - She was stark-staring naked, Simon.<eos> I can't imagine who that was.<eos> - Oh, I thought you were a child.<eos> - No.<eos> - Are you here on holiday?
Some people are not meant to have a family.<eos> I've always had such a special connection with children.<eos> Hey, watch it, you little punk!<eos> Pardon me, guv.<eos> You gents lost your way?
Is the royal family gonna be there?<eos> They're gonna be viewing the spectacle from a balcony overlooking the river.<eos> He's got a machine gun on the barge.<eos> Yes.<eos> You gents lost your way?
Every one?<eos> liable to be thousands.<eos> Then we'll read thousands.<eos> Start with that one.<eos> Perhaps you together would like to have some tea while you wait?
That's videotaping, not filmmaking.<eos> I'm a filmmaker, not a videotaper.<eos> You meet the girl on the hen night.<eos> The real thing.<eos> Would you mind sharing a table?
♪ and we'd feel alive ♪ both:<eos> ♪ back in the '80s ♪ ♪ when all the gentlemen and ladies ♪ ♪ lived life-- lived life how it was ♪ both:<eos> ♪ meant to be ♪<eos> ♪ watching "three's company" on tv ♪<eos> ♪ and wouldn't you agree to sell your soul ♪ both:
Go, Harbor! This is between you and me.<eos> Fine, then let's talk, you and me.<eos> -You've got wrist cuffs.<eos> -You want to tell me what the hell is going on? -I just want to talk.<eos> You want to talk? Why don't you tell me why you brought two skeezy ex-cons to my school bonfire?
Hey, look, you don't wanna tell me where she is, fine.<eos> Jess, she really is at the hockey game.<eos> You'd know that if you'd – what, ladies and gentlemen?<eos> That's right – bothered to call. Why are you hassling me?<eos> Well, mostly because I'm here to hassle you.
Whether you know how come you bled?<eos> Because me oneself this dreamt.<eos> Mum.<eos> Well that you are.<eos> What do you do here?
The man who rank and file Army think walks on water.<eos> Major Samuel Curtis.<eos> Major Curtis may be a hero to a generation of junior ranks.<eos> He may have a chest full of medals and a place in the public heart... but it is my duty to inform you that he has the power to destroy our army.<eos> You see, Major Curtis is planning industrial action.
Ludvig.<eos> - lf he's in jail, we can't...<eos> - Of course you can.<eos> Visiting hours are over.<eos> You're smoking?
What did he do?<eos> He's in Sweden's most heavily guarded prison.<eos> It must have been parking tickets.<eos> Would you go back to your seat?<eos> I'm sorry, but you can't be here.
It wasn't his voice, but he spoke to me.<eos> Claire!<eos> ...Is this your idea of a joke? ...Claire, don't.<eos> Have you got nothing better to do at a time of war than play games with dead bodies? !<eos> You are on thin ice... real thin ice.
-You letting us in or not?<eos> -Hold on a second.<eos> Can I see the warrant?<eos> Watch the front.<eos> Who are you looking for?
Whatever this guy is, he is a man of integrity.<eos> We can all agree that he was on his way to the Hall of Fame without that one shot.<eos> Hey, isn't that you?<eos> (PA) Ladies and gentlemen, Better America and Claremont Media take great pleasure in presenting to you the Omaha lce Breakers!<eos> What do you think?
[Imitating Him] Richard Lawson.<eos> All right.<eos> You sound educated.<eos> Good for you, girl.<eos> I, um... you guys, um, friends of Reese's?
Well, maybe I'll come and stay in it some day. You'd be very welcome, Miss.<eos> To mark the passing of time. Do you know you've been with me longer than any of the others?<eos> Take our coats. Dickie, Clara,<eos> The boy will take our coats. Oh, there, there.<eos> There. Take care, will you?
This is harder than I thought.<eos> Careful, a cop!<eos> Evening all!<eos> - Evening.<eos> Did you know you have...
Come on, then! I am a British citizen.<eos> Ha, since when?<eos> Since I was born here.<eos> This is not looking good.<eos> Are you gentlemen the musicians?
Stanley... I don't know if I should've helped.<eos> 'I mean, the girl, she was...' You worried about her?<eos> 'Yes, I am.'<eos> Well, if you're worried about her, Louis, we'll have to find her.<eos> Mr Julian knows you're here, he'll be with you in a moment.
- So how was Dean? Ladies and Gentlemen, the Williams' sisters take center stage at Wimbledon once again.<eos> - Dinner was bad. - Sorry.<eos> That's okay, I knew it would be.<eos> Oh, but the good news is we can now go back to Luke's.<eos> - You made up! How did you make up? - Well, I'm Mimi now.
- Just Snapple. Great.<eos> Can't you breast-feed?<eos> Here they come.<eos> Get ready.<eos> Have either of you seen this woman?
And model number-<eos> - Can you put it the right way up, sir? Thanks. Model number 19 to ' Raymond's Hair Studio."<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> Model number 17 to, um, ' The Clip Joint. '<eos> Model number 29 to " The Main Line. ' Thank you.
You re only three points behind in the totals.<eos> You can win it, Shell.<eos> All you need is a model for the Total Look. That wasn t the point, Phil.<eos> You, me, Brian, Sandra... family.<eos> No, you're right.
I'm sorry, man. My bad. I'm sorry to hear that.<eos> - I went to her apartment and, uh...<eos> I don't know what happened, man. These two cops wound up dead, and they think I did everything.<eos> What's up with the CIA, bitch? - Ah, here you go, gentlemen.<eos> - Uh, thank you.
An eye for an eye. At what price mercy?<eos> Yeah, mercy. The last bastion of traitors and cowards.<eos> So you would take a man and crucify him on a pole for all to see?<eos> I would seekjustice.<eos> Any of you?
- We're not all that.<eos> You most certainly are.<eos> I would like to bestow upon you the honor of the Genovian Order of the...<eos> Genovian Order of the Rose.<eos> Won't you please kneel?
What an unexpected surprise. For me, too.<eos> I didn't know we were on a hugging basis.<eos> Same old Ira Kane. And you are?<eos> Harry Block, this is Gen. Russell Woodman, head of U.S. Army Research.<eos> You two know each other?
- Indeed, you are.<eos> - Col. Schöngarth.<eos> - Sir.<eos> Maj. Lange.<eos> If there's anything any of you need, don't hesitate to call an orderly or me.
- It would not have been practical.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - I'm teasing.<eos> I take it that you do not get good food up in Kraków.<eos> If all Berlin eats like you, no wonder we have shortages.
Of course he does.<eos> But you can't let that put you off.<eos> He's much more of an obstacle than you think.<eos> Then you must overcome that, mustn't you?<eos> Her Ladyship asked if you would join her in the drawing room when you've finished.
- Yves Adele Harlow.<eos> Man, one day that girl's gonna run out of anagrams for Lee Harvey Oswald.<eos> But four can play at that game.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> What do you think you're doing?
- Sure.<eos> And I've thought about it, and you could be a model.<eos> Hmm.<eos> Thanks, Jackie.<eos> You guys are in real trouble if you did what we think you did.
He's got this whole thing he does.<eos> He's so great. He always gets away with shit.<eos> - Almost.<eos> - Well, almost always, I guess<eos> - Nice meeting you. - Yeah.
I'll be waiting for you.<eos> Our Father, who art in heaven... Hallowed be thy name.<eos> What is it now?<eos> Mind if we come in?<eos> - What do you think you're doin'?
My age is irrelevant here. We shouldn't just give up. We still have a chance.<eos> actually, there is substance to that theory.<eos> If we launch our escape rocket before the faiI-safe warning head informs Aku of our whereabouts we will succeed.<eos> On the other hand, Aku is quite brilliant and, knowing our position, would not only send his ground troops to destroy us but would also block our escape route, forcing us to surrender. gentlemen, the orbital guard has begun to close in around our escape route.<eos> You see? There is no escaping now!
Yep, we'll just have to believe it.<eos> This, this is my youngest son.<eos> They're from the insurance company, or so they say...<eos> So, we'll just... have to take their word for it.<eos> In case you have trouble understanding this you may as well join the demonstration and do some good.

You know, it's because of that sizeable donation, Charlie's puttin' up a picture of you in the monkey house.<eos> Charlie, I'm deeply touched!<eos> - It's a great honor.<eos> Ya know, it's not official, and I still do have to run it by a couple of guys. I can do that right now.<eos> Well, you two obviously... no, no, no, you have a lot to discuss, so why don't you just stay and...?
- J B straight and a Corona.<eos> - Would you like to...<eos> - Double Absolut martini!<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> - Would you like to hear the specials?
He's going back to court tomorrow.<eos> You were gonna make your parole too.<eos> Lock him up.<eos> Mornin', Earl.<eos> I need you to sit your asses down up against this wall.
- A social worker.<eos> According to our information she called here on the 17 th, sometime in the afternoon to look at the baby.<eos> Did a social worker come here to look at Otik?<eos> Mrs...<eos> What did you say?
-Because you're smoking!<eos> Do I sulk when you drink?<eos> Cut the crap!<eos> You sound like two old hookers.<eos> You're here for the desecration.
These policemen want to talk to you.<eos> A kid disappeared last night.<eos> We fucked all night.<eos> Can't you read it on his face?<eos> Now if you'd excuse us, I want some more.
You're supposed to be the best, at least I'm paying you as if you were.<eos> Cut it out and tell me if they're good or not.<eos> Should I pay for them or is someone with a lot of guts... trying to screw me?<eos> Go ahead, do whatever is necessary.<eos> Excuse me, do any of you remember a song by...
Ι'ΙΙ see if he's in.<eos> Ηi, can Ι heΙp yοu?<eos> Hi, Jeff Greene and Larry David to see Alan Wasserman.<eos> - I'll let him know you're here.
Whatever.<eos> Just give me my ball back.<eos> You want it?<eos> Go get it, Stinky.<eos> Men, most of you are at an age where your bodies have undergone significant changes.
Scobie had a supervisor at Morley - a Dr Peter Voss. I'm gonna talk to him.<eos> - You mind if I tag along? - No.<eos> Sir?<eos> We're here to see Dr Voss.<eos> Do you have an appointment?
- You mind if I tag along? - No.<eos> Sir?<eos> We're here to see Dr Voss.<eos> Do you have an appointment?<eos> Do you have an appointment?
We can work something out.<eos> We Germans are not a warlike people. but even we have limits! Right!<eos> Let's bash a noggin! - Yeah. get her! - That's the spirit!<eos> You guys should relax. You'll live longer. Bart. you're supposed to be at Camp David!<eos> You're meeting with debt collectors. and you don't want my help? Do you know how crazy that is?
Mr Peggotty, this is Steerforth, an old friend from school<eos> - You don't look a day older.<eos> - Good to see you after so long.<eos> Why that you two should come to this here roof tonight of all nights of my life.<eos> What do you think, then? What do you think?
And Judge Steve De Roshe scores the bout 9S... 9S.<eos> This bout is a draw.<eos> Great job.<eos> This gentleman's got your cheque here.<eos> You put on a hell of a show out there.
Yeah. Your mall's starting to look good to me. Real good.<eos> Good to hear.<eos> Glad you're finally seeing things my way.<eos> Listen, gentlemen... I'm so excited for my daughter. I just have to go congratulate her again.<eos> Will you excuse me, please?
-We don't care why you're here.<eos> We only care whether your evidence and material amount to anything.<eos> The rest is your problem.<eos> Perhaps at the desk I can get an employment... .<eos> You are about to witness for approximately 61 cents of ordinary household materials the perfect homemade silencer.
Rest easy, good buddy.<eos> You're doing fine.<eos> We got help choppering in.<eos> Hello, gentlemen.<eos> - You are the bereaved? - Yeah, man.
Hello. Is Melvin Smiley here?<eos> - We're Melvin's co-workers.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Is that chicken I smell?<eos> - Have you all eaten?
Nice meeting you.<eos> Don't bother to make up the room.<eos> Just leave a pile of towels and soap outside the door exactly at midnight.<eos> That way we won't have to risk another one of these little incidents, will we?<eos> - Whatever you say, gentlemen.
Well, uh, obviously Joe agrees.<eos> - There's something wrong.<eos> - But, um, tonight, instead of focusing on what we've lost, we'd like to introduce you to something that we've found.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, behind this curtain is the newest member... of the California Animal Conservancy.<eos> We are very happy and proud to introduce to you,
The Extraterrestrial Vulnerability Experiment... has one central goal:<eos> to discover a means to defend ourselves... against the alien species should they ever return to Earth.<eos> Now, as you know, gentlemen, Eve was re-created from a frozen lab embryo.<eos> She's a genetic duplicate of the original Sil.<eos> Now, we have deliberately shielded Eve... from any direct contact with the male gender... which is why, gentlemen, you're inside there.
-I mean, you've already spent forty hours studio time... -Thirty-six. Whatever!<eos> Thirty-six hours studio time on two, three bloody cuts!<eos> Brian, you seem to forget, you're a very big star now and I think your time is worth a great deal more than this -<eos> Fucking space-queen on your fucking high horse!<eos> And all your fucking henchmen! Fuck you, fuck you!
$2,500.<eos> Money down.<eos> - Two seven five. New dealer.<eos> - Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.<eos> - Can I help you? -18,18,17... 12. 17, 20.
Their strategy has not yet become clear.<eos> And this doesn't seem strange to you?<eos> Lochley, go. We've got a situation developing up here, captain.<eos> On my way.<eos> If you'll excuse me.
"Welcome to DRY RIVER a friendly little town"<eos> Morning.<eos> I'm new in town and I was supposed to meet a friend.<eos> I was wondering if you gentlemen might have seen him.<eos> Look, I don't mean to interupt your game, but it would be nice if you at least look at me.
But for their bravery, these villains most certainly would have escaped justice.<eos> But they've not. They've not.<eos> And Dung-Scraper?<eos> I have a horrible feeling he talks for us.<eos> Do you know the difference between a cow and a cabbage?
The Tecora.<eos> And I can bring you as many witnesses as you wish, Mr. Holabird, - to corroborate this.<eos> - Tecora.<eos> Their clients trade primarily off the coast of West Africa, the Ivory Coast, Sierra Leone.<eos> I know what you're thinking.
What did I do to deserve this?<eos> You took the case, Mr. Baldwin.<eos> You took the case, sir.<eos> I should take that as a compliment.<eos> "As you may perceive," "I wish you to act promptly before this matter of the Africans" "becomes a weight on our two countries."
When will we actually see her?<eos> The unveiling will be in about two weeks - you're all invited!<eos> They've asked us to send a scholar of great weight and substance to preside over the ceremony and stay on for two months for lectures and seminars.<eos> Dr Rosenblum...<eos> Dr Cutler... You both hold high claim on this great honour.
- I'll take care of them. - Wait!<eos> Let's use that sucker as a shield.<eos> Move it, we're here.<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> Hey! You idiots.
How is that, sir?<eos> - Uh, well... the possibility still exists that a clever operator of consummate skill might have made them artificially.<eos> Good God, gentlemen.<eos> The girls are eight and 12 years old, the children of ordinary working men.<eos> What cleverness would you afford them?
Much better. Thank you.<eos> My lord.<eos> Father, this is the most unbelievable thing I have ever seen.<eos> Don't you think...?<eos> Are you German?
No.<eos> You sure about this?<eos> We're on the high ground so we can relax. What's the matter with them?<eos> They feel that they shouldn't eat your food because they couldn't stop your town from flooding.<eos> You guys did the best job that you could do.
- Tell me you'll call.<eos> - I said I would. No, you didn't.<eos> You still on medication?<eos> - Why would you say that?<eos> - You gentlemen ready to order?
Billy had a car and he'd give me rides sometimes.<eos> Mr. Tucker, do you, of your own knowledge know anything of the relationship between Billy Hanson and Jim Williams?<eos> Objection.<eos> Objection, Your Honor.<eos> Let me see you gentlemen over here a minute.
Jack was very professional.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Will you put this back in the safe for me?<eos> Would you excuse me?
Well, actually, we wanted to speak to Mr. Duvernois.<eos> He's my son.<eos> He's very shy.<eos> Mr. Duvernois isn't here right now.<eos> But, first of all, do you know what cryonization is?
Director General, I mean.<eos> I´ve damned well had enough.<eos> Bob, Bob, you´ve had your day The lodge will make you go away ...<eos> Like that, is it?<eos> is this how you combat the occult?
Pot to kettle!<eos> Now, then, how can I help you?<eos> Oh!<eos> Poor Miss Simpson.<eos> She taught me at school,you know.
- Gentlemen, please.<eos> - Enough talk!<eos> Mr. President, general, I will explain, and I will rebuild your trust in me.<eos> Tomorrow at noon, I'll hold a press conference and all your questions will be answered.<eos> Then we can meet here afterward, and if you're satisfied, we can talk peace.
What do you think he wants, Lucy?<eos> I think he wants the only other act of redemption he's capable of. I would think that you, of all people, Mr Black, would understand this.<eos> He wants to have a child.<eos> Email.<eos> I think you should look at this.
He's free!<eos> Other prisoners Must have found out Your secret. That you're machines [drilling machine whirring]<eos> I assume you just killed them.<eos> Yes.<eos> The new masters Programmed you Because they're too importan To watch over us.
(commandant) Familiarize yourself with our mechanisms.<eos> Repair them, if possible If not, begin harvesting useful parts.<eos> There are several of us In urgent need of repairs.<eos> I'll show you.<eos> Why haven't the new masters Sent replacements for you?
"Cannon to right, Cannon to left,<eos> "Cannon in front of them Volleyed and thundered" "Stormed at with shot and shell<eos> "Boldly they rode and well into the jaws of Death<eos> "into the mouth of Hell Rode the six hundred"<eos> Whatever it is you two are reciting, I wish you'd stop.
Jadzia's quarters are in the Habitat Ring Section... 25 Alpha.<eos> Shall I escort you?<eos> It's quite far away.<eos> I'll find my way.<eos> If you'll excuse me.
I enjoy water sports and dancing.<eos> - And my hobbies are origami... - Enough small talk.<eos> Would you like those with or without the bones?<eos> And a couple of glasses of water. All right.<eos> Let me tell you about our water then. It comes from the Los Angeles aqueduct... where it flows down a lovely cement channel on a bed of...
It is a serious job!<eos> Oh yes?<eos> Welcome!<eos> Hi.<eos> Have you made your choice?
No way.<eos> No, not for $700.<eos> What have you got here?<eos> For $1,500. Guys?<eos> You want some of the action?
PCR results.<eos> This one belongs to the man who shot Skinner.<eos> And who's this one belong to?<eos> The man who shot Melissa.<eos> You may all be wondering why I've called you here on such short notice.
You've made us wait.<eos> There was a delay on the shuttle from Washington.<eos> You had business there?<eos> Yes.<eos> You, uh... may have already heard.
That dumb letter attempting to drive King into despair... only alerted him to the level of our surveillance.<eos> We could create a film of him with a woman other than his wife.<eos> Using existing footage, we could insert him in a film we make of a woman- a white woman.<eos> The solution is more intense... than just dirty tricks.<eos> If you'll excuse us, gentlemen, the Director has a meeting at the White House.
Nice bit of cake?<eos> Oh, Nanny Jo, everybody...<eos> Sorry it's taken us so crazy long to get here.<eos> We're so glad you could all make it.<eos> You're the Kepps, right?
-Punched the mirror.<eos> Please stop me if you've heard this one before but I am a cheese fanatic.<eos> Seriously, I can talk about this for hours.<eos> Literally, I could tell you the names of the cows.<eos> You seem like very nice people so I don't want to bombard you. Unless you ask me to.
You two together?
I like her.<eos> All right, don't encourage her. Hello.<eos> So sorry about that.<eos> Agnes, hands to yourself.<eos> You must be Agent Booth and Dr. Brennan. I'm Francis.
Are you sure?<eos> Nothing unusual?<eos> No.<eos> I mean a noise like that, it'd wake the boy and then we'd know about it, that's for sure.<eos> Is it just the two of you here? With the boy.
I was out with my girlfriend.<eos> Wessex Police.<eos> Who are you? Ed Burnett. This is my shop.<eos> Why did you have a fight with Ed Burnett at the party?<eos> Don't you think you should tell me a little bit, I mean, anything about what's happened?
Would you mind if we took, er, a DNA swab?<eos> We're taking them from everyone who was there. May do the same with your staff.<eos> It is voluntary.<eos> If that's what you need.<eos> You guys want anything to eat while you're here?
- Yes, Mr. Chairman.<eos> All right.<eos> For those who don't know, we need to prepare the room.<eos> Uh, the Clerk is going to collect your, uh, cellphones, watches, key fobs... anything electrical.<eos> If you prefer not to, please secure your items... - Thank you.
- Hi, I'm Fred Andrews, Archie's dad.<eos> Can we talk?<eos> Penelope?<eos> Clifford?<eos> How are you holding up?
- Yeah?<eos> She's crashing in the ICU.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm gonna have to cut this short.<eos> - I hope you understand.
Everyone is afraid of change, but when life is screaming, "This is your new truth,"<eos> you need to accept it, be bold, be brave, and live your new truth, no matter what it is.<eos> Okay, I would just add that sometimes we may think life is telling us our truth, but we might not have enough information yet.<eos> So, it's important to explore all the options and exhaust every possibility before doing something crazy.<eos> But, of course, you should buy this house.
If she dies giving birth, maybe that's a merciful outcome.<eos> Sometimes, I've wished for that.<eos> There is another issue to consider.<eos> Given the abuse your daughter has undergone, Do you believe that she would want to keep this pregnancy?<eos> In any case, You are teresa's guardians, And therefore speak on her behalf.
It comes from above.<eos> People need to know that action is being taken.<eos> People do? Or management does?<eos> Mister and Mrs. London, I'm Detective Sergeant Noelle Dyson.<eos> The police in Toronto have shared with us that Keith was in constant contact with his girlfriend, Claire, but that you haven't spoken to him in over a week?
Hi.<eos> How are ya? New treatment.<eos> Very aggressive.<eos> Deep muscle... fracking.<eos> Would you excuse me a moment?
If I'm being honest, I do not.<eos> I did not kill my wife.<eos> I mean, back in the day, I was known as a "lady killer."<eos> But I'm out on bail, I have a great legal team, and the support of my friends and neighbors.<eos> And now, if you'll excuse me, heart disease is the real killer.
Guns were one of those things.<eos> I heard what you said about country over party, Mr. President.<eos> I took it to heart.<eos> And when I saw you stand up to Senator Bowman yesterday, Mrs. Kirkman... it reminded me that I could, too.<eos> I'm sure I'll take flack for it, but I won't give in, and you shouldn't, either.
I'm his biggest rival in the party.<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> I'm sorry to interrupt.<eos> What is it?<eos> I thought you would both want to hear...
I don't appreciate being manipulated.<eos> Yes, um, I will perform the surgery.<eos> There's a new regime here at San Antonio Memorial.<eos> And we'd like nothing more than to serve those who have served us.<eos> So if you'll excuse me, I have a surgery to prepare for.
I-I work three jobs.<eos> What is going on?<eos> Ma'am, you see these cars?<eos> Your son stole 'em.<eos> Are you sure? Yeah.
Unlike you, I actually listened to the testimony.<eos> The prosecution clearly did not establish that the defendant knew his actions would result in Ms. Spencer's death.<eos> Therefore, I am setting aside your verdict.<eos> You are free to go, Mr. Clark.<eos> And you are dismissed.
Nothing too...<eos> Ooh!<eos> I may have left the engine running in the houseboat.<eos> I may have a dozen or so spare bedrooms in the mansion.<eos> There you have it.
When was this?<eos> That would've been just after I got out of the sanitarium.<eos> That was two years ago.<eos> Maybe longer.<eos> Did you not suspect anything?
I didn't know it was the same gun.<eos> Otherwise, I would've thrown it in the river.<eos> How do you not know that? You ever been addicted to heroin?<eos> Lieutenant Woods?<eos> As you can see, the historical record shows 56 complaints of excessive force against Sergeant Voight.
Look at me. Look at me!<eos> Show me your strength. Come on. Come on.<eos> All right. Come on. Come on.<eos> I know things such as this don't happen here... on the fifth floor. I apologize.<eos> That's not necessary. If you'll excuse me.
I don't blame either one of you.<eos> You didn't go out and buy the dynamite and make the bomb.<eos> You didn't plant the bomb.<eos> I feel badly for you both.<eos> The two of you are as much victims of this tragedy aswe are.
Your passport, please.<eos> Hello.<eos> Are you alright?<eos> It's stuffy in here.<eos> Are you together?
Come here.<eos> What?<eos> - What? - You're my brother.<eos> - Yeah. - Are you ready for this?<eos> Good morning, everyone. It is great to have you with us for the running of the Boston Marathon.
Jesus Christ!<eos> Guys, lower your weapons.<eos> Shit.<eos> I'll tell ya, that boat ain't gonna float.<eos> If you're just tuning in right now, there has been what appears to be a major development in what has been a 19-hour search for a 19-year-old bombing suspect for the Marathon bombing.
will be forced to leave the state.<eos> Leave the state?<eos> What does that mean?<eos> It's exactly what it sounds like.<eos> You two are not allowed to be in the state at the same time, and certainly, aren't allowed to be here together.
Twenty-five years.<eos> That can't be right.<eos> Look, you got a year in state penitentiary, which, I remind you, could have been up to five years at the maximum, you got a year in prison on one hand, and leaving the state on the other.<eos> That's an easy choice.<eos> Try not to talk unless he directly asks you a question, which he won't.
- I think so.<eos> - Okay, cut, Tommy.<eos> Mr. and Mrs. Loving?<eos> We wanted you to know that, with all this travel back and forth from Virginia, you have my number and if anybody arrests you, you have them get in touch with us.<eos> We're not gonna let you spend one minute longer in jail than it takes us to get down there to get you out, okay?
Yes.<eos> You got some tea I can drink? Mmm-hmm.<eos> All right.<eos> Testing, testing. Testing.<eos> What do you think you would do if you...
Now, he was sent by your business partner, who apparently wanted to become a sole proprietor.<eos> My partner's going to pick him up, okay?<eos> Have a nice day.<eos> Sorry to keep you waiting.<eos> You must be...
I remember.<eos> The story's infamous.<eos> Perhaps too much so.<eos> The woman in the box...<eos> I know you must have questions and I'm excited you're here to help the cause, But first I must tend to this cargo. If you'd excuse me.
You want to ask the question again?<eos> Sure.<eos> Can you give us an update on the assault and battery charges filed on behalf of your ex-wife?<eos> Wait, wait, wait!<eos> As you can see, folks, it's gonna be a hell of a fight.
- Sorry, no.<eos> I don't remember.<eos> We were busy Saturday.<eos> Zahra.<eos> If you like you can talk to the boss.
Must be you got a lot of fancy stuff up in New York City if that's for traveling'.<eos> You was listenin' to us.<eos> Don't tell massa.<eos> I just...<eos> I ain't never seen no niggers like you before.
Project Mercury... named after the winged messenger of the gods in Roman mythology.<eos> Today, three years, two months, and three days afterwards... we're ready, after 10 scheduled attempts...<eos> Attagirl. To try again to put our first man into orbit... to put Colonel John Glenn into orbit.<eos> Colonel John Glenn will be the first American to orbit the Earth.<eos> As you can see, there are thousands of people here today to witness this historic event.
How many more of these do you want us to do?<eos> Seal them all.<eos> Unable to get to their parents.<eos> Should be terrified and must be so shaken.<eos> As you can see...
Maybe I can call you again.<eos> Well. Well, we'll see. We'll see.<eos> You can just wait here.<eos> Manny will get your car.<eos> - You must be the Tarlows.
Oh, but you see, the two go hand in hand now.<eos> So, are you on the ticket or not?<eos> What if the gun bill passes in the House, but not the Senate?<eos> In return for what?<eos> You convince the senator to pull out.
I thought we had an understanding.<eos> Your obedience.<eos> I'll see what I can do.<eos> Do you agree with Doug?<eos> You're having reservations about LeAnn?
Rot in hell, Sands.<eos> My days here are numbered.<eos> I don't know exactly how long the booster shot's gonna last.<eos> Naz isn't gonna risk you taking a pill without it.<eos> You sacrificed your connection to the immunity shot for me?
He's just moved in around here.<eos> So what do we do?<eos> Look for the street on the photo.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Who are you?
Amy, is there any sign of the Eagle or is he crossing America on a lawn mower?<eos> Ma'am, we really ought to get someone in court right away to file a Hail Mary injunction to extend the deadline, someone who can stall till we find the ballots.<eos> I already thought about that.<eos> I've got it covered.<eos> So the lady-in-waiting came over to us and she said, "Her Majesty thought perhaps you would like to see her crown."
Look, you should know, Mr. Blye has gone missing.<eos> Blake.<eos> He was meeting with Navy Commander Gil Lively in New Orleans.<eos> About?<eos> We're hoping you could tell us.
You are flying with us till Frankfurt, is it?<eos> Yes, we are going to see you in Frankfurt.<eos> Perhaps. Great enjoy your flight.<eos> I don't have patience like your mother. Hold this.<eos> Since you are seated at the emergency exit, it's important to brief you.
Excuse me, you are?<eos> Liz Walters.<eos> My media consultant.<eos> Apparently with free press you need these things.<eos> Will you be joining us at the dinner and photography exhibit?
I'm gonna have to stop you.<eos> Uh, the word "problems" implies a value judgment.<eos> That you were telling them, essentially, that there's something wrong with them.<eos> Well, I-- well, they are here, so...<eos> A better choice would be something more neutral, like, "What types of issues have you been dealing with?"
So I just want to appeal to Mrs. Cordero as a mother.<eos> _<eos> Jane, really, - this isn't a good time. - No, no, no, please, l-let me just say one thing.<eos> Please. I am so sorry.<eos> And you know what, I know how you feel.
That's not for me to answer.<eos> For every homicide, there should be a motive.<eos> The one who benefits from the victim's death is usually the one we identify as a suspect.<eos> So in this homicide case, who reaped the largest benefit?<eos> As you all see, not me.
Well, then you should have rescheduled them, not pawned them off on other doctors.<eos> I think "pawned off" is a strong term.<eos> Plus, it was Dr. Leveau's idea.<eos> Well, then let's go look at the calendar in case Dr. Leveau has generously taken other cases off our hands.<eos> And how did you two meet?
Pass here.<eos> Follow me.<eos> I'm, uh, I'm Patty's brother.<eos> This is her father and stepmother.<eos> Why did you come here?
Two hours ago, I was at a pancake social in Dixville Notch, charming party insiders, when the guy at the syrup bar tells me Pakistan is imploding.<eos> Thanks for making it back so quickly.<eos> Mr. President...<eos> Mr. Jackson, welcome back.<eos> You're all needed in the Situation Room.
If she was, she was living here with a dude.<eos> Holy shit.<eos> What?<eos> Your inheritance.<eos> Have you had a chance to consider what sort of arrangements you'd like to make for your loved one?
What?<eos> Your inheritance.<eos> Have you had a chance to consider what sort of arrangements you'd like to make for your loved one?<eos> Yeah, how do we get her into the ground as soon as possible?<eos> Are you Jewish?
There are very real things we can do to intervene and help him.<eos> Behavioral therapy has shown...<eos> No, no, we're not listening to any more of this.<eos> - Nedra.<eos> - I recommend you do.
But you've never seen anything like them.<eos> - Honestly, go on!<eos> - I don't need to go!<eos> All right, all right.<eos> So back when you were five or six, a rainy day, your mum set you up on the kitchen bench and said, "Let's bake a cake."
Ye be coming down to breakfast?<eos> Thank you, Prudie.<eos> Master Jeremy and I will be taking our breakfast here from now on.<eos> No, but the chores is piling up downstairs!<eos> You're mistook, Prudie. This is a more genteel way of doing, I think.
Which is why I brought the helicopter.<eos> Helicopter...<eos> We can't...<eos> Mr. Ramirez, there will be no charge to your family as long as you're at Bunker Hill.<eos> I just need you to sign a document releasing your daughter to our care.
By whom.<eos> Uh, sorry.<eos> I always assume that my reputation arrives before I do.<eos> It's been said by many that my ego certainly does.<eos> I don't mean "called" in any way you'd be familiar with, via ATT, or Sprint if you're particularly gauche.
If you want something done on Mars, you gotta do it your damn self.<eos> _<eos> The best scientists in the world...<eos> in the universe...<eos> But as you know, we need the infrastructure to support those settlers when they arrive, and that begins with power.
What's happening?<eos> She is in respiratory distress, unable able to contract her diaphragm and chest muscles enough.<eos> I need to intubate, now.<eos> Broselow tape.<eos> Mr. and Mrs. James, I'm gonna need you to step outside, please.
-I've picked out what I'd like to order.<eos> -I don't trust you.<eos> -Calm yourself, there'll be wines.<eos> -Okay.<eos> Hello. How are you doing today?
Of course.<eos> He wrote the paper that forced us to mothball Piazzi.<eos> It's simply tragic.<eos> And whether his assertions turn out to be right or wrong, clearly Mr. Cole had a singular mind.<eos> In ways that you may be unaware.
But...but let me just get this right.<eos> So, you... ..you say they haven't been going to school regularly?<eos> That's correct. You need to talk to your kids.<eos> I know, but... I mean, surely that's not just our responsibility?<eos> Well, you're their parents.
Wait, wait, wait.<eos> Maybe 18th.<eos> Please admire the beautifully carved...<eos> Now please admire these beautifully carved pillars that are engraved with typical Rajasthani which are engraved with typical Rajasthani carvings. ...typical carvings which...<eos> And you, you, you can see...
Excuse me.<eos> Walt takes great pride in his work.<eos> He spends every waking minute thinking of ways to make it better.<eos> I don't suppose it could have ever occurred to him that someone else could own that?<eos> If you don't mind, I'll go join my brother.
Then stop that little bastard in the arm his mouth and pulls the trigger.<eos> There is daily violence, detective.<eos> So tell me no nonsense story a great kid which not hurt a fly.<eos> Because I do not care of it.<eos> You were involved in yet so a shooting, right?
Sometimes 6:00 in the morning.<eos> And every day, I would wear a different disguise.<eos> I took photos of everything.<eos> I made detailed notes of every inch of the towers.<eos> As you know, the North Tower has been completely finished for the last two years, and the South Tower is completed up to the 80th floor.
Carol, did you, uh... bring that book with you?<eos> The one with my ugly face on the front?<eos> Could you hand it to me?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Now... if you'll all be so kind as to look right here.
Jung is a must.<eos> I'm more of a Freud man myself.<eos> Have you read any?<eos> One chooses their teacher and remains faithful.<eos> Are you in the business?
Ah, Mrs Sprot. I didn't see you there.<eos> I was reading a book.<eos> Crime fiction.<eos> Not one of yours.<eos> What mischief are you two up to?
"A lone wolf, he gets it done himself<eos> "without yes-men and flunkies."<eos> You know, a wolf is actually a pack animal.<eos> I'm more of a lone squirrel.<eos> You both need to choose bicycles for the Bike For Health event.
Have you noticed that your father's been having mood swings?<eos> And he rarely plays the piano anymore?<eos> I've noticed a few things, Charles.<eos> I guess we were... so busy with your mom that I just dismissed them.<eos> Let me reassure you, we'll have him back here before you know it.
That's not the right thing.<eos> But she's very mature.<eos> Suzu-chan will manage just fine. She's smart.<eos> No, this is a grown-up's job.<eos> If you want, shall I do it?
Why the fuck do I get the one with the dress?<eos> - Just put the fucking thing on!<eos> - For fuck's sakes.<eos> Ahhhhh!<eos> [Steve Rogers] As you can see, the Palliser Motel is on fire.
Well, mightn't we be more comfortable inside?<eos> No.<eos> Ma'am.<eos> Sir. My name is Inspector Bartholomew Rusk.<eos> And you are?
(SIGHS)<eos> - Ms. Hartley?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> We got a lot of complaints about noise from your neighbors early this morning.<eos> You having a party?
! Or his 40-year-old best friend?<eos> And why aren't we talking about the fact that he has a... 40-year-old best friend?<eos> ! - The school's fine with that?<eos> - Fishy.<eos> I don't think you understand.
I'm too big to fail, so I whisper in the ear of my creepiest follower...<eos> "Emma will infect us all."<eos> We got your fingerprints on the tea mug.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> Now, if you'll excuse me,
You know nothing, Jon Snow.<eos> Are you lonely?<eos> Just bored.<eos> My father used to tell me that boredom indicates a lack of inner resources.<eos> Were you bored a lot too?
- There's a solution.<eos> - That won't be necessary.<eos> We will no longer be requiring your services.<eos> - It's not personal.<eos> - If you're unhappy there may be other directions.
- Do you?<eos> - I know nothing about art.<eos> - Do you?<eos> - Yeah. A little bit.<eos> I hear you're talking about Brandt.
You know... big asians.<eos> How much did you weigh when you were 16, like 170, 180?<eos> I need to ask you to leave.<eos> Sore spot, huh?<eos> You know if you don't talk to one of us here, we'll have to ask you to accompany us downtown.
- I've checked with the uniform on the gate.<eos> Nobody left since they got here at 8:30.<eos> Right.<eos> Look, this is a reconstructed photo-fit picture of the fella we found in your pit.<eos> Either of you recognise him?
And fomenting riots on Ceres. And inflaming passions in the wake of the Canterbury.<eos> The history of organized religion isn't exactly strife-free.<eos> I've been asked to request a new Head of Operations.<eos> Of course.<eos> If that's what you want.
You know all office visits are $140.<eos> - There you go.<eos> - Awesome. Do you have a friendly pharmacist or will you buy here?<eos> Uh, actually, I'm not gonna buy today.<eos> I understand you don't only dispense drugs, you also, you know...
So I don't know. Maybe it's a good thing.<eos> - You figure out tuition?<eos> - No. No, I got an idea, though.<eos> Is it an idea that could land you in jail?<eos> - You're here for Ian Gallagher? - Yeah.
~ How long were you there for?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Well, according to CCTV, you entered the hotel around 11:37pm. And left just after a quarter to two.<eos> Over two hours.<eos> What did you and DI Hardy do alone in his hotel room for two hours on the night that he'd arrested and you'd beaten up the defendant, your husband?
- Oh, my God! Check us out...<eos> An Asian kid and a black kid bonding over music by white Jewish rappers.<eos> America's crazy.<eos> Mitch: Hi. Welcome to Cattleman's Ranch.<eos> May I get you a table or a booth?
There's gotta be compassionate ground, something you can work with.<eos> We have dual incomes now, on the advice of your employer, I might add.<eos> We just need a little more time.<eos> Please.<eos> How much do you charge for a general appointment at your... "Pet Clinic and Animal Hotel"?
- An average figure.<eos> - 100 dollars.<eos> - 100 dollars?<eos> Now, let me see... your current overdue repayments... divided by 100 dollars equals 194.<eos> Are you telling me that in a rural area such as this... you know of 194 sick animals that are gonna be coming to visit your little pet clinic every month?
I've got the results of your scans here.<eos> Oh, um, I'm sorry, Doc.<eos> I'll... I'll come back later.<eos> No.<eos> Are you two...?
That the war needs to start giving results fast.<eos> And then the professors can do as much research as they want.<eos> I admit that the thought is understandable.<eos> But it's too short-sighted.<eos> I want to explain something to you and I ask you to keep it in mind.
Whatever Evan and Emery are in trouble for, Eddie put them up to it.<eos> Oh, don't worry. Your boys aren't in trouble.<eos> Oh. [Laughs]<eos> - What a relief!<eos> - Good! You are.
- What a relief!<eos> - Good! You are.<eos> - What?<eos> ! - Why? What did we do?<eos> It's what you haven't do.
They're called jobs.<eos> [Laughs nervously] Uh, what my wife means is she has her real estate career, and I have my steakhouse.<eos> Look, we can't volunteer.<eos> Is there anything else we can do?<eos> Well, you can donate money.
Two weeks after I sign the papers, we lose our liquor license.<eos> The owner forgot to pay his bribes on time.<eos> Turns out, not many people want to enjoy a lap dance with a cold glass of apple juice.<eos> A lot of the dancers have surgical scars. Is that on purpose?<eos> And so, how long have you been married?
Can't we, Alice?<eos> Absolutely. It'll be cozy.<eos> You're sure I can't check--<eos> I'm quite sure, thank you.<eos> May I get you started with a cocktail? Ladies?
Because-- because, without that, it just-- it just plays out in exactly the same way.<eos> Another son without a father becomes a father who doesn't know how to love his son.<eos> And if... If I stay, they have a chance to fix what is broken.<eos> Are you saying that this is what you need to do now, for the time being, or what you need to do forever?<eos> Is there nothing I can get you?
I don't know.<eos> Do we really need color?<eos> "Do we really need color?"<eos> Do we need to settle for what came before?<eos> Don't you want to really see the world?
Here, let's call them now. Okay.<eos> Hi, Mr. Park? It's Gabi Diamond.<eos> I work with Elliot.<eos> Yes, the annoying blonde cook.<eos> So anyway, Elliot's boyfriend broke up with him and I don't want him to be alone on his big day, so I was wondering if maybe you could fly in for a birthday dinner tomorrow night.
You're screaming in your sleep about children, about saving children.<eos> It's like you're fighting something, and... and Tommy's... he's not himself.<eos> I... we could take him to see someone, but I don't know exactly what we'd say.<eos> Well, we could start with, "It will end and begin."<eos> I take it you're the Greggsons?
Any other option, seriously.<eos> I mean, if she would have just chosen any other option...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Are you actually blaming the banker for your behavior at the meeting?<eos> So can we get you something to drink?
And he said, "Son, grandson,<eos> "when your feet are frozen,<eos> "that is when the fish are the warmest."<eos> Excuse me, Captain.<eos> If you'll all excuse me, I have a call I have to take.
Could you just...<eos> Can't you go round?<eos> There's room.<eos> Looks a bit tight.<eos> Couldn't you...?
As my late father used to say, if reason fails, try force.<eos> Look at that.<eos> I always hoped it would pass me by, but no such luck.<eos> That's all there is to it.<eos> - Oh, you're busy.
What?<eos> You don't mean that.<eos> I'm sorry, my lord, but I cannot stay if I cannot perform my duties.<eos> I should have been more honest with you, my lady. Oh.<eos> - Oh, I didn't know you were in here.
Where?<eos> Where did you meet him?<eos> Uncle!<eos> - Oh, how are you?<eos> How come you're here?
What do we do, then?<eos> - Can we sue the newspapers?<eos> - I would certainly recommend it.<eos> But it will be hard to squash the rumors with your head in the sand.<eos> The best would clearly be if you could persuade the surrogate ...
Or was that just dumb luck?<eos> And did you know about PJ?<eos> Did you know what my son had just done to himself?<eos> Pernell, where's all this coming from?<eos> You sought me out in my most vulnerable moment to use me.
This is a fine house.<eos> And Mr Carson's right.<eos> It would be an honour to hold our party here.<eos> But it's not what you want.<eos> Well, to start with, I'd like a kind of reception that's different from the ones you're used to.
Just us, and that's the way I'd like to celebrate it.<eos> I couldn't understand more, Mrs Hughes.<eos> I hope we'll be invited.<eos> Of course you will all be invited.<eos> We'd be honoured if you come.
Me too.<eos> In fact, it's the longest time I've spent in London since my cousin came out.<eos> She was with us at Brancaster.<eos> Rose Aldridge.<eos> I remember. I thought you were a very jolly party.
I've got tea for all of us, and a snack for you later on.<eos> You're an angel of mercy.<eos> Are we interrupting?<eos> Not a bit of it, m'lady.<eos> You're very welcome here.
Lucy, fetch the scones.<eos> - When does the photographer arrive?<eos> - Five o'clock, M'Lady.<eos> I'm afraid some of the village have caught on and they're waiting too.<eos> - Are you sure you want to do it?
You made something of a habit of that, offering women lifts.<eos> You will appreciate that my client is a very busy man and has come out of his way to be of assistance.<eos> He has a right to know where this is headed.<eos> This woman in particular.<eos> Do you intend on pressing charges?
So she says to the doctor,<eos> "OK, but only if I can have the flu with it."<eos> That's very good!<eos> Oh, you must be Mrs Harding.<eos> This is a lovely party. I'm sure you're very proud.
GBR Industries. How may I direct your call?<eos> GBR Industries. How may I direct your call?<eos> May I help you?<eos> We're here to see David Tenant.<eos> Of course. Do you have an appointment?
Enough!<eos> Kill you.<eos> Go on, all of you!<eos> Quite enough fun at my wife's expense.<eos> So if you will excuse us.
Go on, then.<eos> Why are you here, Neil?<eos> Because in the last five years I've thought a lot about your body and it's got to the point that I desperately want to know what's going on underneath that dress.<eos> Basically, Gemma... ..I'm here because I think we'd have a really good time fucking.<eos> Are you ready for the main course?
Great Sage, I just saw you talking to Buddha.<eos> Then you must've met...<eos> Catch me now, you stupid kid!<eos> Great Sage!<eos> You must've met Buddha!
So what is going on?<eos> What the hell are you hiding?<eos> This is an emotional day for all of us, but to suggest that my company has anything to do with what's happened...<eos> You've said enough, Mark.<eos> If you'll excuse us, we have a meeting across town.
I think this is inappropriate, you coming to my house like this, upsetting my wife.<eos> - I will be in my office tomorrow.<eos> - Mr. Wellick, as you can imagine, this is very time-sensitive.<eos> We just need to ask you a few questions.<eos> Actually, both of you, since you were both in attendance at the reception last night.
- I'm sure it's correct.<eos> - It's correct.<eos> Okay, then let's pick the date again.<eos> Give me your husband's horoscope.<eos> - You've been married almost three years?
I'll go prepare.<eos> Do you want to spend a moment with Amena before they take her in?<eos> Yes, please.<eos> My assistant will show you to the waiting lounge.<eos> If there's anything you need, anything at all, don't hesitate to ask.
Mr. Murphy, I'd like to take a DNA sample.<eos> A simple swab.<eos> Say ahhh.<eos> I have so many questions, but the most reliable data come from your cells.<eos> As you can see, I'm taking a plasma sample.
I'm on my way.<eos> It's Merida.<eos> Aren't you out a little bit past your bedtime?<eos> I've seen something of your fighting style.<eos> You were trained by ra's al ghul.
Serve them some water.<eos> Hey!<eos> Bitch.<eos> Welcome.<eos> - Are you from Seoul?
Apparently, Rebecca is the one who initiated it.<eos> We need to talk to Rebecca.<eos> She's not here.<eos> Where is she?<eos> I'm sorry, who are you?
You were right.<eos> Cordero's definitely hiding something.<eos> - Find out what it is.<eos> - That's why I'm here.<eos> So glad you're here.
- very seedy.<eos> - Get off!<eos> Boys!<eos> Now...<eos> You were also invited.
We're not done here.<eos> Agent Booth, all you have is a motive and a theory.<eos> And if we're listening in on everything that you're doing, then we'd know what evidence you have.<eos> And you don't have jack.<eos> So... if you'll excuse me.
Just investigating every avenue.<eos> Do you know anyone who might want to hurt him?<eos> No, no.<eos> Everyone loved Robert.<eos> Er, could I have any CCTV that you might have, please?
What happened?<eos> They're all dead.<eos> Oh my eyes are burning<eos> I'm going ahead to find the rest of the chaps.<eos> You going to be okay?
have you heard of Jack Witkowski?<eos> This man dishonored me.<eos> So, here's my question for you and your lovely wife, Anna.<eos> Are you team players?<eos> What do you mean? Whose team are you on?
Tell me what's going on.<eos> I'm in the backyard.<eos> RAY:<eos> Don't listen to Hazel!<eos> You are risking his life.
What's going on?<eos> I don't think they were meant to be presented in quite this way.<eos> - No.<eos> - Hi!<eos> You must be the Coopers.
Derived from the Greek for "uterus".<eos> Much studied by the French, it has of late come under the scrutiny of our Austrian colleagues.<eos> Tonight, we'll endeavor to add a British accent to this chorus.<eos> Bring in the patient, please.<eos> As you can see, the patient is a comely woman of five and thirty years who has been under my care at Bethlehem Hospital.
- Yes, I saw that.<eos> -That was nice.<eos> What's nice about a stone in your shoe?<eos> It was nice when she took it out.<eos> Pardon me for asking but could I interest you in some novelty items?
- No.<eos> Your very family will consider you dead.<eos> You shall not be spoken to.<eos> You shall not be seen.<eos> You shall not be heard.
We should also have enough for you to keep this house<eos> I'm going to the bathroom<eos> Hope the mood lightens up when I come out<eos> Hello<eos> Do you have an appointment?
He's a novelist.<eos> Hi. Nice to meet you, Chris.<eos> My assistant.<eos> Hey. it's so good to meet both of you.<eos> Hello. May I get you anything to drink?
Shit.<eos> Are you firing me, Naseem?<eos> You have a past, eh, Stretch?<eos> Lots of drugs, alcohol, gambling.<eos> You were addicted, yes?
I don't know.<eos> I guess I just... lost.<eos> Lost what?<eos> Love.<eos> You were married.
WELCOME TO CITY OF BRADFORD KENDALL<eos> Also in the same turn!<eos> Tell me what's your secret!<eos> Must keep pace!<eos> You ask!
- I'm taking you in my carriage. - Yes.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Legal meeting in English. ...<eos> - OK, OK.<eos> You are French, I see.
Oh, my!<eos> Who shot him?<eos> !<eos> 'Emergency.<eos> Which service do you require?
- We're not ready for this.<eos> What I can do is give you some time to go into the house, grab all the stuff you need, whether it's medicine, stuff for your baby, jewellery, any pictures, anything valuable.<eos> No, no, no. You aren't supposed to be here today, OK?<eos> So you're leaving.<eos> I can only give you a few minutes to grab some personal belongings.

You aren't supposed to be here today, OK?<eos> So you're leaving.<eos> I can only give you a few minutes to grab some personal belongings.<eos> - I'm gonna ask you to leave.
This is the property of the bank now.<eos> We're giving you an opportunity to collect some of your belongings.<eos> I suggest you take advantage of it.<eos> There's two ways to do this:<eos> the easy way where you pack up and go or I escort you to jail.
Fix up this whole hospital.<eos> What did I say?<eos> Keep these guys back.<eos> Oh, my God, it's your dad.<eos> As you can see, Commander Ray Whitehill of the Sector Enforcement Unit scans the wristbands of the Atrian Seven, allowing authorities to track their location while at school.
Now look Susie, all these people in here are used to being first in line.<eos> So get ready, because they're all gonna want answers, and there will be no line.<eos> I think I can handle it.<eos> We understand, we understand how distressing this is, but we are here to help you and I can assure you that ev...<eos> Look, I know you all have questions and I know you're used to getting answers, but I have none for you.
My brother couldn't cope with what happened to him at Blenheim Vale.<eos> A depression, the coroner ruled.<eos> The police looked into it, of course, but... ..no suspicious circumstances.<eos> It was all I could do not to laugh in their faces.<eos> Just out of interest, where were you both the night Alderman Wintergreen was killed?
Does anyone else know Gabriel Pasternak?<eos> - Me.<eos> - Me too.<eos> Why?<eos> Why are you on this plane?
That place... that let me just keep on... hitting her... and hitting her... and... and, uh... hitting her.<eos> I couldn't stop.<eos> I couldn't stop.<eos> Hmm. That's some shit, man.<eos> Hello, passengers, we wanna thank you for flying with us today.
So... something something.<eos> I think they deserve an update, don't you?<eos> Some of the locals seem to think he had plans to develop in Whitley.<eos> Well, he didn't, because we don't.<eos> Look, I know it's hard. But is there any chance David could have been doing things you weren't aware of?
Concealing what he was up to on dad's big day.<eos> Or they didn't tell us.<eos> Remember when this was all fields?<eos> Ah, Nicky?<eos> You're not Becky and Dan, are you?
- I know of him.<eos> And also there Ulrik Dybbøl, another student at Griffen Holm.<eos> Exactly.<eos> You have done your homework.<eos> - That's what you pay us for.
I am learning Excel.<eos> - Jeff, do you know Excel?<eos> - No. Well, it looks like you do.<eos> Teaching.<eos> I, as you know, am Dramatic Professor Sean Garrity and you are now embarking on an odyssey of discussion about an actor who keeps the world asking:
At best, you're going to insult me and then I send me away and tell me that you're no longer interested at a boy<eos> Who only was there to amuse you a little and so I will go and you'll chase me beg my pardon and caress me<eos> You remember my name and that what has been was perhaps true was perhaps true<eos> At best,<eos> I'll find you along with whom occupied my place
Bring your tools.<eos> I got 'em.<eos> Hi, how are you?<eos> Welcome to Rayburn National Bank.<eos> Mr. Delarge is waiting in his office, if you'd like to follow me, please.
- Because I was in a bulletproof car.<eos> Does this mean that we've officially not quit?<eos> We've never been quitters, have we?<eos> Sir, Mrs. Underwood. Sorry to interrupt.<eos> I was gonna head home, but I'll stick around if you want me to.
The tanker would then cost a million bucks.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa. Excuse me?<eos> Your secretary's out to lunch.<eos> Hope you don't mind we let ourselves in.<eos> What are you doing here?
Come in.<eos> This is my wife, Mae.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> Sit, please, sit.<eos> What exactly are you here for?
I'm just curious.<eos> And I must say, I love what you've done with the remodeling.<eos> Oh, we did it together.<eos> I detected your touch.<eos> How long have you two been married?
Dad's stalking, right?<eos> Sorry, you're Allen Barnes' daughter?<eos> Yeah, well, one of them.<eos> I've a sister, Ness.<eos> I think you've met her?
Do you recognise him?<eos> I don't remember.<eos> We were busy Saturday.<eos> Zahra.<eos> If you like you can talk to the boss.
Someone who did their bit.<eos> You're their traditional leader and they like you to pray with them, in mourning and in gratitude.<eos> But I should be praying in the back row, not the front. That's all.<eos> Please don't think us too forward.<eos> You have no need to worry.
Douglas Landry-James, - Dean of Musicology at Chicago Poly Tech.<eos> - And you've... heard both songs at issue here, the original rap song and Rowby's song?<eos> Sorry. I was waiting for my objection.<eos> No, I think the judge is aware of what you're doing.<eos> - I have no idea what either of you are doing, but let's shut up.
It clearly shows the defendants leaving campus at 7:10.<eos> So, this shows them during the time they claimed to be at the movies?<eos> That was a lie.<eos> They never went.<eos> What you're seeing right here is the defendants leaving the scene of the crime.
All I remember thinking when she was murdered is, uh, who on earth would want to hurt that girl?<eos> According to the phone records, the last call she made was to this office at 10:00 a.m. the day she died.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> We need to speak to Dr. Levine.<eos> Do you have an appointment?
Okay.<eos> Come on in.<eos> It-it was a long time ago.<eos> Please.<eos> Tell me anything that you remember about that night, where you were...
Well, now you do.<eos> This place can throw whatever it wants at us and it doesn't matter.<eos> You know why?<eos> 'Cause the Gecko brothers ride again.<eos> You kept them on you?
No, sir.<eos> I thought we were here because...<eos> Don't say anything, Katherine.<eos> Not a word.<eos> I don't know why you thought we brought you in.
I imagined my death many times, but I never thought I'd meet the sun in someplace with wall-to-wall carpet.<eos> Howdy, Mr. Northman, Ms. De Beauford.<eos> My name is Katsurou Ryouichi, but my friends call me Mr. Gus, Jr.<eos> Now, I'm the North American president of Yokonomo Corporation, an honor bestowed on me by my father Mr. Gus, Sr., president of Yokonomo Corporation.<eos> Now, our signature product, as I'm sure you're aware, is Tru Blood.
He was Austrian?<eos> Edward something?<eos> Amadeus. Edward Amadeus.<eos> Right.<eos> What a creep. "Would you like a view of the sea, or the war?"
To my parents?<eos> Haven't we lied enough to them?<eos> Apparently not.<eos> Okay.<eos> So far the answers to your questions verify that you two have spent enough time with each other to conceivably be engaged.
Uh, this is Eleanor Caldecott, of the Caldecott Academy.<eos> Of course.<eos> Yeah, I've heard great things.<eos> Hey, listen. Remind me next time I come over, to fix that handrail out there.<eos> Do you two not live together?
- Not yet!<eos> Uh, yes, I'm looking for a Cabbage Patch Kid.<eos> You do?<eos> Uh, really?<eos> C-can you put it on hold?
What do you got?<eos> Uh, Your Honor, it'll only take a few minutes to establish probable cause in this case, as the evidence is<eos> - overwhelming.<eos> - Really? Mrs. Florrick. Your Honor, according to the DEA's own search warrant, it stemmed from a single eyewitness.<eos> And I imagine you'd like to hear from that witness.
Trust me. - The leak is elsewhere.<eos> - Okay. Now, I'd wanted to clear everyone before I asked your firm to do this, but events are moving too quickly, so, I have to ask you to, uh, keep this completely to yourself.<eos> We need you to be on call at 3:00 tomorrow.<eos> Why? Well, Mr. Bishop is delivering something to O'Hare.<eos> In case of trouble, I need you on call.
You know, this one is tough because... thank you... on one hand, we have a... a quantity of cocaine that has been found on the defendant.<eos> - Your Honor, we would dispute...<eos> - And on the other, we have a witness who doesn't seem to know one day from another, and a prosecutor who just won't talk.<eos> - Judge, if I may... - You may not.<eos> This is when I talk and this is when you... listen.
I understand, Mr. Grant, I know, but your son is mid-trial.<eos> The Grants. Their son... they want a second opinion.<eos> Uh, no, I'm sorry.<eos> Look, Will Gardner is Lockhart/Gardner's top litigator.<eos> No, I'm sorry, sir, but you're in good hands.
Let me tell her you've arrived.<eos> The NCIS agents are here.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> She'll be right with you.<eos> Why don't you have a seat?
The private investigator?<eos> Oh, come on. You're not serious.<eos> I mean, no, there's no way that an intelligent young man like Michael Elliot would have anything to do with such a...<eos> disreputable character.<eos> I'm sorry, uh, you'll have to excuse us.
It's up-and-down, back-and-forth all at the same time going on at once.<eos> Okay, well, anyway, I deleted all our modules last night, and I completely rebuilt our engine, from scratch last night.<eos> Um, now, this morning I really only had enough time to do one test, and when I did, we hit a Weissman score of 3.8.<eos> Now, I know the theoretical limit was 2.9,<eos> - but as you can see here...
Elizabeth, uh...<eos> Elsbeth Tascioni. Hi!<eos> Um, what is my approach... to litigation? Well...<eos> - No. Will, no. - Okay...<eos> I want everybody to close their eyes and picture a pillow, a big pillow, the size of this room, and you're lying in the middle of it.
Good.<eos> You're awake.<eos> What the hell is this?<eos> This is what I've been waiting for.<eos> You were planning to kill me, Tom.
No, Louis. A friend just won't hold it against you if you don't.<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> I do.<eos> But before we start, I'd like to make a statement.<eos> I am here to tell the truth, but what I want you to understand is that truth is subjective.
I signed his death certificate because he was dead.<eos> Please. We just need to reach him.<eos> We know that he's in town.<eos> You helped him because you knew that he was in danger, and we're in the same danger now.<eos> I'm sorry, you're wasting your time, and mine.
I expected more harassment.<eos> You haven't answered his appeal yet.<eos> I'm giving you time and space to craft your reply.<eos> Oh, that's mature.<eos> You're Holmes and Watson?
This just doesn't feel real to me.<eos> We have theater tickets for Tuesday.<eos> I don't know what my life is now.<eos> Again, we're very sorry for your loss, ma'am.<eos> How long were you married?
Am I Jewish? Yeah.<eos> Why? I need you to sit second chair.<eos> On what?<eos> Do you care?<eos> The voir dire process is a very important one, because it enables the court and the lawyers to determine whether or not each of you would be appropriate jurors for this particular case.
Let me handle this.<eos> I'm gonna get Mike Wallace on his ass.<eos> - Don't do that.<eos> - Hi.<eos> What type of account were you interested in?
Mr. Hanley says it's business as usual. Even though we haven't seen a customer for days.<eos> And we have learned, though this report has not yet been confirmed, that one of their own, possibly a Jupiter police detective, has himself been missing for two days.<eos> Reliable sources in the police department have circulated the clarion cry that, "No stone will be left unturned.<eos> The boys in blue are out for blood."<eos> This news report is brought to you...
Grabsomepeanuts on your way in, sir. Thank you so much.<eos> Step right up, folks.<eos> It's the marvel of the century.<eos> A live freak birth.<eos> Something like you've never seen before.
Why we got to travel all this way for skeletons and such?<eos> Because I need a witness to this in case something happens to me when Stanley's called out.<eos> All this here is because of him?<eos> And another recent acquisition of which we're very proud-- a male died from natural causes.<eos> And as you can see, the skull is a classic representation of microcephaly.
I can't do this.<eos> If it's the price... for a nation.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, the Secretary of State.<eos> 'Good morning.<eos> 'As many of you are aware, 'we have had to draw the tragic conclusion that, two days ago,
The way you were holding that pen...<eos> Ah, well, old habits die hard.<eos> On occasion, I relent to my demons.<eos> I know what you mean. [ chuckles ]<eos> How close were you with vicky? Not...
No, no, thank you.<eos> Uh, we are just doing a follow-up On a suicide that happened Sunday night.<eos> Oh, I heard. A student of james'.<eos> Just awful.<eos> You and your husband -- you were at the opera?
Walter Gillis knows what he's doing.<eos> Yeah, so do I.<eos> He's letting your pension go unfunded, so he can hoard $1 billion.<eos> No, that money is earmarked for expansion into Asia, and I believe in Walter's vision.<eos> You might, but do the workers you represent?
What?<eos> !<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Have some water.<eos> Are you ready to order?
To finally sit down with your father.<eos> Tell him everything you've been carrying around in your head all these years.<eos> Yeah, you don't know my father.<eos> I know you.<eos> I see you're awake.
And that someone is Daphne.<eos> - We're gonna fight this.<eos> - We'll pay the damages.<eos> We're gonna go to trial. We're gonna fight this all the way.<eos> Okay, that's an option, and we'll assess the merits of a trial once I get the full discovery, but what you have to remember is that if Daphne loses, and I firmly believe that she could very well lose,
You know that.<eos> It's been a lovely holiday and you'll never forget it or the people you met here.<eos> But it's time to come home now, Arby.<eos> And you can never, ever... come back.<eos> As you all now know, Corvadt has today gone into administration.
I will miss her.<eos> You're late.<eos> Head winds.<eos> You know, my shoulder still hurts.<eos> You... have claws.
And if we both fail?<eos> Quite simply?<eos> I'd be ruined.<eos> A man without country or resources.<eos> As you can see, failure is not an option.
- Hello.<eos> - Hello. Can I help?<eos> We're here to see Sara Shah.<eos> Sara Shah? Yeah.<eos> Sign in. I'll let her know you're here.
Eight rings!<eos> You'll have to do better than that.<eos> Get over here as soon as you can.<eos> Fancy a walk?<eos> Come on, I need you out. Come on. You and all, come on.
Matches your artist list exactly.<eos> Millions in revenue.<eos> Give us five minutes to log everything on the hard drive for Cabe and then we'll give it back to you again.<eos> I was pleased to hear you didn't drop off that roof.<eos> You appreciated my heroism?
What happened in there?<eos> !<eos> We needed this drive.<eos> When I tell you to get out, you get out.<eos> You risked Rebecca's life, you risked your life, and now they've seen your face, Walter!
- I grew it especially for the part.<eos> - Didn't I tell you?<eos> I knew he would figure it out.<eos> This has all been a game, and a colossal waste of the Constabulary's valuable time.<eos> What were you hoping to achieve?
Okay, this could get intense.<eos> Howdy doo!<eos> Happy day!<eos> It iintense!<eos> You're Robbie's parents?
"To free all those who trust in him from Satan's power and..."<eos> Male, 9 years old.<eos> Possible ruptured eardrum.<eos> His name's Paul.<eos> - You're his parents?
For five years Joe Doucett has eluded justice.<eos> Where could this fiend be hiding?<eos> I'm James Prestley.<eos> Tonight, we examine this mystery of crime.<eos> What can you tell us about Mia?
Say that to me again?<eos> Get out!<eos> I don't want to...<eos> I don't want to... I don't want to ever to see you again.<eos> Well, you might see me on Friday.
Edith Greensly.<eos> Alfonse Simone. Hey. Hi.<eos> Alfonse Simone. Irving Rosenfeld.<eos> Please, be seated.<eos> I appreciate the fact that you all came in person, but, the trip was really unnecessary, because this whole thing could've been done with a simple wire transfer.
-We are right here baby.<eos> -You're gonna be okay. - Okay buddy? .<eos> -We're right here, you're gonna be fine.<eos> Hold it, hold it, only the nurse!<eos> Just the nurse, I'm sorry but you'll have to stay here.
Welcome, Sir George, Lady Stubbs.<eos> - Good evening, Sir George.<eos> - Good evening.<eos> I'm so thankful you're here at last.
Yes, I suppose it is all down to me now.<eos> All right, Victoria! All right, I understand.<eos> We don't want to make a fuss, and I certainly don't want Tim worried about this.<eos> About what?<eos> Here you are, sir.
That would leave the bee rudderless.<eos> - Oh, bullshit!<eos> - Everyone, please.<eos> I know what I said. I... There is...<eos> If you will all...
And people in hell want ice water.<eos> Listen, enjoy the hotel.<eos> You're on vacation.<eos> I just booked your flight.<eos> As you all know, we have invested over $4.5 billion worldwide.
Yes, but it is not model. Will not get it right.<eos> He's not your boyfriend?<eos> But he has patience and it is incredibly conscious.<eos> Listen, but listen well, is how it goes ... if you fuck with me now ... You will be out of the picture. You understand what I'm saying?<eos> You are seeing large architectural designs.
Chetty, come on.<eos> You're not going to trip us with a technicality.<eos> He's right here.<eos> Oh, Billy, Billy, Billy, what have you done?<eos> It's you lot I feel bad for.
- Or a Tesco home delivery. What?<eos> Yeah. She was only identifiable by her dental records.<eos> Why, what had they done to her?<eos> They'd made impressions of her teeth.<eos> Still, fortunately, you two have had the presence of mind to plan for your future.
Saturday<eos> What did you find?<eos> Come on.<eos> Mr. and Mrs. Kimble, in most cases has lost just not a phone that works.<eos> Your daughter is probably at a friend and are just as worried about you.
I hate you all.<eos> Thank you. No incendiaries in the White House.<eos> All right, baby, I just gotta get my weapon real quick.<eos> You're gonna have to sign out, sir. Hello.<eos> You guys here for the tour?
Nor is she related to one... anymore.<eos> I'm not going anywhere without her.<eos> Let us recall for you now what has transpired.<eos> KRLD is reporting that they have been told by somebody in the hospital that the President is dead.<eos> Well, that is a repeat of something that you heard reported to you directly a moment ago from KRLD in Dallas.
- Human error.<eos> But was it a seizure?<eos> The report doesn't mention any seizure.<eos> You don't know what happened?<eos> You can file a civil lawsuit if you want to.
Nearby in Valcuvia there's the Po Valley choir, very talented and I think they deserve to perform on opening night.<eos> - On the derriére.<eos> - You mean premiere.<eos> That's my input.<eos> You're free to do as you wish.
You find my laptop, and suddenly we have two detectives?<eos> There was also a dead body found at the scene.<eos> Lucky we weren't home when we were robbed.<eos> We don't know who the victim is or why he was killed.<eos> We're hoping that you can help us with this.
Ritchie, it's nearly my time!<eos> I can't do it!<eos> Midwife calling!<eos> Is anyone at home?<eos> I'm afraid if you don't answer, someone more senior will have to call tomorrow.
Oh, I know.<eos> I went to the MM Store once.<eos> Yeah, we got real crazy.<eos> So crazy that we decided to make him and me official.<eos> You got married?
Jumped in front of a moving car with you in the trunk.<eos> You both could've been killed.<eos> Claude, I won't apologize for doing what is right and what I was asked to do by my boss.<eos> We are so not done talking about this.<eos> And where do you think you're going?
I, uh, would like to thank you for... taking the time to listen to me today.<eos> I've been in other courtrooms where the voice of the handicapped is often shunted aside and ignored. But not here.<eos> That's the great thing about America.<eos> Dear God.<eos> These movements that you see are called tardive dyskinesia.
The museum labs are in the east wing of the museum.<eos> LISBON: What can you tell us about the victim?<eos> We think it is Linda Parfrey. You think it's her?<eos> Linda has been missing for some time, and...<eos> Well, you'll see.
Ugh. Rules are just so... tiresome and boring.<eos> Ah, Ms. Robbins, hi.<eos> We're sorry to bother you this late.<eos> No, please, call me Cayce.<eos> I-I hope I didn't make you guys wait too long.
She was a cruel and vindictive woman, willing to do anything just... to get her way.<eos> So you weren't conspiring with Curtis Wiley to undo Elise Vogelsong's will?<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> But you and Wiley did have a conversation with Elise outside the soldiers' home, did you not?
No.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Take your time.<eos> Look, I know you're only doing your job, but I'm trying to do mine, and this isn't exactly good for business.<eos> So, if you don't mind.
No. Not Therese.<eos> Daryl Dexter.<eos> Thank you for seeing us.<eos> No problem.<eos> Can I get you a drink? Something fizzy?
Feels like the old days, having you as our main rival.<eos> You weren't around back then.<eos> I was, you just didn't look hard enough.<eos> It's the final meet of the season coming up.<eos> It's you lot against us, winner takes all.
[Crying] We're here, love. We're right here.<eos> Let's get her typed and crossed for 3 units.<eos> - We're right here. Please.<eos> - Excuse me, excuse me.<eos> This is as far as you go. No, no, no!
It was gone.<eos> Do you think I am crazy?<eos> Comedown lady.<eos> These are routine questions relevant to the case.<eos> Now, how much time do you have living in this house?
These are routine questions relevant to the case.<eos> Now, how much time do you have living in this house?<eos> Five years.<eos> Five years living on this roof that is falling apart.<eos> Why did you move here?
It was a stupid idea.<eos> PZV were trying to buy the brewery.<eos> Finches had rejected the first offer.<eos> It would've made the owners a fortune but you often get this issue with a family firm.<eos> Can I get you any drinks?
Five...four...three...<eos> OK, come in to camera one, on one.<eos> OK, clear two.<eos> These people are known to you, I believe.<eos> What are you doing here?
My penis.<eos> You said it wrong.<eos> I did not say it wrong!<eos> Thank you all so much for coming.<eos> If you'll indulge me, I would like to share a story about my dearly departed grandmother.
Woman to woman. On the count of three.<eos> Three, two, one...<eos> Shh, shh, shh. There it is again.<eos> I think it's coming from there.<eos> Excuse me, who are you?
- You hit it off? - She was fun.<eos> She had this - I don't know - Sara Crewe fantasy.<eos> Some wild idea her father was a rich, foreign nobleman, and that one day he'd come and find her.<eos> If that was her dream, I wasn't about to spoil it for her.<eos> Why did you all deny knowing her? Why not?
Nothing now.<eos> Seal the exits.<eos> Expecting someone?<eos> No.<eos> Are you Randall and Lisa Flynn, parents of sergeant Edward Flynn, stationed at Bagram Air Base?
Now, most of these gauges here just monitor the turbine speed, temperature, etcetera, but this is the boring stuff.<eos> That's not why you guys are here.<eos> You guys are here for cost effectiveness.<eos> The nitrogen and CO2 that we're injecting into the hydrate... It forces the methane out and traps the carbon dioxide simultaneously.<eos> I know how much pressure each of you have had on you to maintain the status quo, so, again, thank you for your forward thinking.
Well, I'm sorry, but she'll never be Huey Lewis.<eos> Oh, no, wait. No, no, no.<eos> Wait a minute. Wait--yeah. Eve has always been really good, so--<eos> And we think scholarship, maybe the Olympics.<eos> Okay, let me put this in terms you can understand.
The rig was sabotaged, and TESHA is trying to cover it up.<eos> Mr. Ewing, I can assure you, we are not in the "sweeping things under the rug" business.<eos> We are in the "getting to the truth" business.<eos> The investigating committee finds Ewing Energies negligent in the operation of its methane rig, causing irreparable environmental damage.<eos> We find you fully liable...
I got a call for her that morning for a go-see.<eos> She wouldn't answer her cell.<eos> You go to her apartment?<eos> I was judging a new faces competition in Albany the day she disappeared.<eos> What are you implying?
- Winter -<eos> - Excuse me, good morning.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> - Can wee talk to Mrs. Bontal, please?<eos> - Do you have an appointment?
- No, we are with the police.<eos> - My daughter, Isabelle?<eos> - Isabelle ... or "Lea".<eos> - Lea?<eos> That is the name of my mother, I do not know what you are talking about.
They tell me it's as common as a forged ration book these days.<eos> Were you aware your husband owned a revolver?<eos> No.<eos> He abhorred violence.<eos> How long have you two been together exactly?
Perfect. No way Theo could have seen that.<eos> Excuse me, ma'am?<eos> You dropped this.<eos> Right this way folks.<eos> I need you to exit the building. Thank you.
You just said his name!<eos> Kill him.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, the prosecution have not even managed to place my client at the scene.<eos> Indeed, we have 100 witnesses who saw him that same night at an event some 50 miles away, supporting one of his many charitable causes.<eos> So, if they cannot show that he was there or establish a link to the events that took place, however tragic they may be, how can you possibly find him guilty?
Emminger: Celine, you told me, you promised me that you had broken it off with him.<eos> We were in love.<eos> God.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Why are you here?
Dimka: How is this possible?<eos> Al: Your press attaché.<eos> Someone hacked his BlackBerry while he was staying at a hotel.<eos> I see.<eos> Well... what do you propose?
- His future?<eos> Karen, please.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> It's come to our attention that Danny has violated a strict condition of his continued enrollment here at Green Grove High.<eos> What are you talking about?
Cash. They left it on here.<eos> What time was this?<eos> 10:30?<eos> What about the room? Has it been cleaned?<eos> Yes, but, er...you can have a look, if you like.
I don't know.<eos> Sounds like... crying?<eos> Any further witnesses, Mrs. Florrick?<eos> Actually, Your Honor, we ask to be heard in a SCIF.<eos> You ask to be heard in a SCIF?
We went up 11 times...<eos> and then bought a boat.<eos> And then we blew it up, 'cause we wanted to watch it burn.<eos> We owe creditors hundreds of thousands of dollars.<eos> - How were you planning to pay for...
Hi, Glenn.<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> ! No!<eos> No way! Glenn, remember, the thing we love most about each other is that we push each other way beyond our normal boundaries.<eos> Did you enjoy your stay at the Marriott? No, I did not.
Please check again.<eos> I need to get them through customs in Maribor.<eos> Mrs. Holden.<eos> Yes.<eos> Uh, where would you like to vacation today?
- we're morally in the clear.<eos> - I agree.<eos> - We can hold our heads high.<eos> - Yeah. You just make sure no one else sees us.<eos> Excuse me. What are you doing?
Chairman, Ministers.<eos> Today I've repeatedly heard how irrelevant my department has become.<eos> Why do we need agents?<eos> The Double-O section? Isn't it all rather quaint?<eos> Well, I suppose I see a different world than you do.
- He was ours.<eos> - Yeah, we were his.<eos> - And we were a family.<eos> - We were a family.<eos> Have we lost you? Are you still with us?
Don't worry, it's nothing personal.<eos> She does it to everybody. It's like a first contact. It's like dogs sniffing each other's ass.<eos> Oh! The bloody elevator. It always does this.<eos> Of course.<eos> I'm sorry. You can't smoke in here.
Fuck you!<eos> Damn!<eos> Damn it!<eos> In your opinion, why are you here?<eos> Do you have...
Bring your own container."<eos> I just hope they have a bed.<eos> If they didn't, it would probably be called "Elysium just Breakfast."<eos> Does everything have to be a joke, George?<eos> Are you looking for the B and B?
Let's have a look, shall we? This won't hurt a bit.<eos> We've a given him a mild sedative.<eos> It'll make him a little groggy, but it'll help him get better. You'll be fine soon, okay?<eos> By the way...<eos> Your blood type, a and o... you're sure?
Luisa didn't request her granddaughter's custody, but her daughter's and she died as a girl.<eos> We're trying to find a solution that leaves Julia out of it.<eos> Before this becomes a legal problem.<eos> Sorry, I don't really understand you.<eos> You could be a good foster family and also guarantee she has controlled visits with her grandmother.
And let me apologize in advance for any inconvenience we might cause.<eos> Science will be very grateful to you.<eos> Well, that is my sole objective.<eos> It's me who should be grateful to you.<eos> Oh, you already know Dr. Haynes.
I appreciate this privilege of being able to be here and speak with Americans.<eos> Please, God, be kind.<eos> You know, I think a good barometer here when we're trying to figure out has this been a good time or a bad time in America's economy is... go to a kids' soccer game on Saturday<eos> and turn to any parent there on the sideline and ask them,<eos> "How are you feeling about the economy?"."
- Hi, how are you?<eos> Sorry, Eric, there's nothing I can do for you now. What the fuck is that?<eos> I'm gonna take you to the Shrim Healing Center.<eos> Come on.<eos> You'll feel much better. Excuse me. I'm so sorry, everyone.
I just don't like it.<eos> There's too much water underneath.<eos> Theresa darling,<eos> I'd be worried if there wasn't enough, all right?<eos> Now, let's find you a bottle of pop.
The guy has 20 minutes to eat.<eos> - That's not enough.<eos> - Faugères for table 8.<eos> - Aren't they having veal? - Yes.<eos> You ordered Faugères?
First time.<eos> We to come... very far.<eos> Osaka, Kobe, Tokyo, Kyoto, Hokkaido.<eos> I'm sure I've seen your face.<eos> Are you fans of gastronomic dining?
Help me!<eos> Help me!<eos> I will, madame.<eos> Have a wonderful performance.<eos> Are you ready?
Oh, my God, I'm...<eos> I'm so attracted to you.<eos> I...<eos> So why haven't we done anything about it?<eos> I-I just... you know, sometimes taking things slower is better.
So you would have been at the dinner the night before last?<eos> Oh, we wouldn't miss it.<eos> It was our chance to, you know...<eos> remember Ollie.<eos> Well, you've sacrificed more than most.
On the one hand ... the Don Juans, the seductive, the womanizing friendly.<eos> And on the other, whores and sluts.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Now, I will show a photograph.<eos> And I want you to react without thinking.
But I'm going to write this story with or without your input.<eos> Feel free to sue me.<eos> My only asset is an answering machine brimming over with livid messages from my creditors.<eos> You see, I have nothing to lose, Mr. And Mrs. Grayson.<eos> While you, it would appear, have plenty.
Can I have some more?<eos> Even if you have seconds or thirds of this the calories are still lower than one pack of those snacks you used to eat.<eos> Really?<eos> -If you keep getting fatter, you'll be troubled, right?<eos> If you eat healthy stuff from childhood, you will always be healthy when you grow up.
The museum labs are in the east wing of the museum.<eos> What can you tell us about the victim?<eos> We think it is Linda Parfrey. You think it's her?<eos> Linda has been missing for some time, and...<eos> Well, you'll see.
- Give me a break.<eos> - Ms. Gutierrez.<eos> I'm sorry, Your Honor.<eos> I just have a hard time taking the State seriously when it's wearing that tie.<eos> Let's adjourn while you two grow up.
Well, thank you for the invitation.<eos> Tell me, when did you last see Natalie Gibecki?<eos> - I'm sorry?<eos> - Don't be.<eos> You said you were looking to volunteer.
Jane van been.<eos> Oh, of course, for the manager position. Yes.<eos> Welcome.<eos> I'm Olivia Doran.<eos> Um, can I get you an espresso?
Why is that--Kati would drink wine on occasion.<eos> Why is that relevant?<eos> Well, it's probably not.<eos> Um, I'm sorry. I wasn't listening earlier.<eos> You're her in-laws, you're not her parents, and this is-- this isn't your house?
We came to take Megan to our house for the day and give Kati a little "me" time. It's a regular thing we do.<eos> Mm.<eos> What does Kati like to do during her "me" time?<eos> You know, I think she just likes toe the help the day off and enjoys the solitude and the peace and quiet.<eos> And when did you return here?
But don't worry, Vicky.<eos> Omar'll protect you.<eos> Why are you telling us this?<eos> - Are we supposed to feel bad?<eos> - No. No, it seemed like something you might like to know.
Fixed your favorite oatmeal.<eos> Put in brown sugar.<eos> I know how you like it.<eos> Here's a quick look at what we can expect the 5-day forecast to look like.<eos> As you can see, it will be slightly on the cooler side of average, with temps in the mid- to upper 50s with partly cloudy skies...
Lady, that was a promotional deal I worked out for Shawnee.<eos> And yeah, I got one, too, but she didn't pay a dime for it.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> If she doesn't finish this tour, she's gonna have to rent out her brownstone and move downstairs to the basement apartment, where she stores her junk. And I don't want to see that happen.<eos> And by the way, I know what you think.
Looking for Aden Braddock.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Stop! Police!<eos> Hi.<eos> Oh, you--you must be the CBI people.
# But don't make me bring up what she did to that pup, # # that cute little pup.<eos> I just might well up. #<eos> # But I'll continue my rhyme for a dime, # # or a penny is fine. These are difficult times. #<eos> # Yes, difficult times. #<eos> # Thank you, sirs, you're too kind. #
So, you don't mind if I look around? Uh, no! Of course not!<eos> Calpurnia?<eos> May I speak with you in the kitchen?<eos> Certainly.<eos> And I'll let you get back to your-- Elegant dinnah pahty!
You know Christopher?<eos> Hardly, but I did meet Mr Tietjens last year in Rye.<eos> I haven't seen him since.<eos> Actually, this tea is for my mother, and I mustn't inflict myself on Mr Waterhouse with my inferior mind and general incapacity for anything much except motherhood.<eos> So, if you'll excuse me.
I've worked with a number of excellent sergeants during my time on the job, and I feel I've learned valuable leadership lessons from all of them, sir.<eos> As a sergeant, what characteristics do you believe are essential for effective leadership?<eos> Effective leadership is about making quick, informed decisions and standing by them.<eos> I feel I can bring this type of leadership to any command where I am assigned.<eos> I'm sure you've all been briefed on the recent shooting I was involved in, and it may have given you pause.
- Who's calling?<eos> - My name is Toni Bernette.<eos> I'm calling from New Orleans.<eos> I'm an attorney. And I would like to talk to Dr. Evans about the work he did here post-Katrina.<eos> So why did you come here today?
We can digitally make it look like that - to imitate a zoom.<eos> - You didn't want Kara - to commit suicide? - No.<eos> My aunt committed suicide.<eos> I found her dead in our garage when I was eight.<eos> I know what you're going through.
The Special Court of Inquiry is now in session.<eos> The Honorable Murphy Wicks presiding.<eos> Who the heck?<eos> Hey there.<eos> Oh, please, you can all sit on down.
AN:<eos> Um, is this FE Construction?<eos> Who is this?<eos> Uh, I'm a lawyer following up on a un-cashed check from FE Construction.<eos> Unfortunately, we'll need you to reissue the check.
You know what you have to do.<eos> Point it towards the store, idiot!<eos> Damn it.<eos> Take over.<eos> Hey, you guys, you must be lost.
The grandkids want pictures of the lion, but, oh... these damn phones make it so hard to see the damn buttons.<eos> May I?<eos> There. It's sent.<eos> Wow.<eos> You... you guys really did get up close.
Let's try to track his movements yesterday.<eos> I'll get out to his apartment.<eos> Is this Jason Kubiak's apartment?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I-I'm sorry. Who are you?
She's nice.<eos> Oh, Rigsby's taking a personal day.<eos> The baby's sick and Sarah has court.<eos> - He's really embracing the daddy thing. - Yeah.<eos> You guys the cops?
Depositions for a corporate law case.<eos> Trish is a junior partner at Hunter McFadden.<eos> Beautiful and smart. Wow.<eos> Your mom's gonna have a tough time finding something wrong - with her.<eos> - Ladies and gentlemen, could you take your seats for dinner?
He had nothing.<eos> No one.<eos> And now? He has a life.<eos> A real life here. One that keeps him grounded and decent.<eos> As you've heard, there are many people who care about Neal, people who see him as more than just a criminal.
What happens to you if Harvey loses?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But right now, it's not my job to worry about him losing.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, guilty is not gray.<eos> You either are or you aren't.
You have to promise me not to use this against him... Or anyone else.<eos> Tell me everything.<eos> It was self-defense.<eos> Alejandro broke into her house, and when Gaby came home, he attacked her.<eos> This gem just came on the market, and as you can see, it's a warm, cozy, homey place.
Captain: Ladies and gentlemen, this is the captain.<eos> Well, no good deed goes unpunished.<eos> We arrived 10 minutes early and ground traffic control doesn't have a gate for us.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> It'll be just a few minutes and then we'll have you on your way.
- Mac?<eos> - Back to you, Jane.<eos> The president was scheduled to address the nation at 10:30.<eos> But we have been told it will be closer to 10:45.<eos> If you're just joining us, I'll recap everything we're able to report.
He's only 16.<eos> Why not go with him?<eos> I'm an L.A.P.D. detective.<eos> I got two kids, a full-time job, and since my wife died, it's just me.<eos> Now, if you'll excuse me.
And so would Kaylie.<eos> Are you expecting someone?<eos> Room service.<eos> No reason a couple of friends can't have breakfast in bed.<eos> - You order me eggs Benedict?
- Let's get 'em.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Son, come feel the felt.<eos> Dad, I really don't think you're supposed to feel the felt.<eos> If they didn't want you to feel the felt,
- Thank you.<eos> He got laid off.<eos> Ms. Schweikert, you are excused.<eos> And, why don't we reconvene tomorrow at 9:00?<eos> I have my Harvard Alumni Association meeting, and I'm sure you all...
And, why don't we reconvene tomorrow at 9:00?<eos> I have my Harvard Alumni Association meeting, and I'm sure you all...<eos> Attorneys, please approach the bench.<eos> Ms. Schweikert, may I have you remain on the witness stand?<eos> I'm sure you're all familiar with Illinois Supreme Court Rule 243, which took effect last July.
You.<eos> Sarah, why did you change your hair?<eos> You were so pretty as a redhead.<eos> You said you'd never come back.<eos> Excuse me, who are you?
Hi. Uh, this is Mel Barnett.<eos> He'll be joining us from Miami.<eos> Peds surgery.<eos> I'm the new attending.<eos> And you are?
- Can I help you?<eos> - Um, uh-- so this isn't the connection.<eos> Uh, maybe we need to check the pharmacy where they got the pills.<eos> No, Byck and Tufano went to different drugstores.<eos> Can I ask what you're looking for?
Okay, coordinate with 'em and then you get back here<eos> ASAP.<eos> Captain Gates?<eos> Captain Gates.<eos> What are you two doing down here?
I have nothing to do with that case, I don't know what you are talking about.<eos> We are not saying that you do, but if someone at Zeeland does, we need to know that.<eos> It could save the life of your daughter.<eos> I'll make sure it is looked into.<eos> But what are you doing?
What?<eos> Oh, Gina from the construction office didn't call you this morning and tell you?<eos> 'Cause everybody knew we were coming down.<eos> You know what?<eos> Why don't you sort this out with the office and come back?
You can never touch me again.<eos> What will happen now?<eos> I don't know<eos> But I will touch you.<eos> Hi, good you are here.
Brian's symptoms-- the jaundice, the hair loss, the high blood pressure-- coupled with a hepatic lesion, it's all consistent with, uh, the use of anabolic steroids.<eos> What?<eos> What the hell?<eos> - Are you taking steroids?<eos> - No. Have you noticed changes in behavior, uh, moodiness, depression...
I think she was always going to kill her.<eos> And in California, Monica Tenez, the candidate for U.S. Senate, has seen a significant uptick in the polls.<eos> So much so that she's now neck and neck with incumbent opponent Dick Osborne.<eos> Coming up next is the presidential debate.<eos> This is ZNN coming to you live from...
Well, in chambers it'll be on the record, Mr. Gardner, and-and...?<eos> Alicia Florrick.<eos> Ah, the state's attorney's wife.<eos> Very fortuitous.<eos> In there and in here, it'll be on the record, so if you have a motion, let's hear it.
This is Kent Brockman at the site of the so-called "Springfield Miracle."<eos> The question is... Is the hope tree a miracle?<eos> Most decidedly not.<eos> Flying the Channel 6 traffic copter without official clearance and below legal levels, we obtained the following footage.<eos> As you can see here, a shadowy figure emerges from the darkness, walks up to the tree in the Simpsons' backyard, and if we freeze and zoom in on the image,
Oh, they're not commercials exactly, more like sponsorships.<eos> You take the most expensive jokes and you have them underwritten by a corporate sponsor,<eos> - like...<eos> - P.B.S.<eos> Right, so for instance "this evening's violent gay butt-rape joke will be brought to you by the American musical theater association."
Well... welcome home, sir.<eos> Joseph, meet my wife, Frances.<eos> - Pleasure to meet you, madam.<eos> - Hello, Joseph.<eos> You must both be cold and hungry after all that, so let's get you inside.
The home of the Muppets!<eos> What happened to this place?<eos> Where...? - Where is everyone, Gary?<eos> - I don't know, buddy.<eos> OK, well, I guess you guys are it for today.
I'II see how Kattaka's doing.<eos> Mihau, it's your turn!<eos> There she is!<eos> Mrs Graumann!<eos> What are you doing here?
Oh...<eos> Two.<eos> Live in the UK?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Where have you been?
Most things don't.<eos> But, you know, sometimes what happens instead is the good stuff.<eos> Don't you have work to go to in the morning ?<eos> Yes.<eos> Now, if you'll excuse me.
Saint Gregory The Illuminator.<eos> Here's the Archbishop of Palermo Saverio Cincotta, this is his third Conclave.<eos> Cardinal Masao Takada, archivist and librarian of the Holy Roman Church.<eos> We can see Sidi Kamara, followed by Koma Mbosou.<eos> As you know the African continent has never...
- Bikila?<eos> - We believe...<eos> - Todorov?<eos> ...within a few hours, the Pontiff will introduce himself to the faithful from the balcony.<eos> At that point you also will meet him and we will celebrate the new Pontificate together.
- Letty!<eos> Wrong door.<eos> - I know, I know.<eos> Thank you so much for coming.<eos> I have one table available now, but if you wouldn't mind waiting, it should just be a couple of moments for another.
It's not like I'm trying to send a man to the moon, for heaven's sake. Unh.<eos> Well, come on in.<eos> Don't just stand there.<eos> I'm Cameron McCarthy.<eos> And you are?
Mike. Show some respect, huh?<eos> I'll show some respect by winning the case that put her in the ground.<eos> Fuck this.<eos> Come on.<eos> The reason you... The reason why you should invest in Safety Point is because it's safe and it's affective.
I'm sure they did.<eos> Nice home.<eos> You know, my mama, she used to... She used to work as a housekeeper in a beautiful home.<eos> Like this.<eos> How long you've been living here?
There was an Omega on his skull.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Right. Turns out he wasn't the only one.<eos> Every one of those x-rays belongs to someone who was a visitor at this club.<eos> You know, the Joneses may have gotten made, but they had no idea what they were getting themselves into.
- Mr. Garrity, I...<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> - I'm sorry, but we normally...<eos> - Sir, please, please.<eos> If you... if you don't mind, please.
You're the only ones without a tangled agenda.<eos> Think about it.<eos> This really shows you how difficult it was on the trek west.<eos> Have you seen this room's... oh.<eos> Um, why don't you go on to the next gallery? I'll catch up with you there.
- palm Ridge?<eos> - Here.<eos> - Juniper creek.<eos> - Albert Grant, present.<eos> Okay, to you, representatives of the polygamist communities, and to you, representatives of state agencies, welcome.
-You saw me. Why?<eos> Is that the legal bit?<eos> I think, in all the fuss, I may have signed my own name. So?<eos> I can confirm that Lara Tyler and James Arber were finally married today in a small, tasteful private ceremony.<eos> They will be leaving for a secret honeymoon destination in the morning, but, as you can see, they will be spending their wedding night in that turret there.
Nuts from the plane.<eos> They're awful.<eos> Do you want some? Sure.<eos> Hello, Wallace.<eos> And you're here to see...?
- Letty!<eos> Wrong door.<eos> - I know, I know.<eos> Thank you so much for coming.<eos> I have one table available now, but if you wouldn't mind waiting, it should just be a couple of moments for another.
-Good job.<eos> -Thank you.<eos> -Sure.<eos> Doc can hear you, he just can't speak, or move very well. Parkinson's.<eos> Where you headed?
- For the demonstration.<eos> To be honest, I don't do a lot of work in the field.<eos> Really?<eos> So this has been a real education.<eos> I did my thesis on Einstein's field equations, and are you familiar with the gauss-bonnet theory which posits that exotic matter need not be present to superluminally traverse two points in space time?
You're the one who told me to drive here!<eos> I don't even know your real name. What is<eos> - Bro... Okay. Listen.<eos> I don't have time for this. I need to impound this car.<eos> I'm gonna ask all of you to please pick up your belongings and make your way to the curb.
Could easily have been any one of ours.<eos> This is a pattern of behavior that has to stop.<eos> We need to end this.<eos> We need to fire that man.<eos> I understand that you guys are upset.
You just can't pick it up and walk off with it.<eos> Right.<eos> Hey, Andy. A-anything?<eos> Uh, no sign yet, boss. But we have some folks here that are pretty concerned about their safety deposit boxes.<eos> If you could all just form a single line, that would be swell.
Rose!<eos> Help me!<eos> Help!<eos> Abby.<eos> Like I said on the phone... you're gonna be mighty proud.
Erik?<eos> Shh.<eos> Shh.<eos> Don't talk.<eos> They'll hear you, ok?
The way she was meant to be remembered.<eos> We appreciate that, father.<eos> Have you thought about hymns?<eos> There are some very nice selections in here.<eos> Maybe you could pick out a few you'd like to consider.
And not just us, Healthy Bar does too.<eos> If Healthy Bar believed in her so much, why are they only throwing out $25,000 until they see how she does?<eos> They're not sure about her, Mark.<eos> They're not. We may have just thrown it all away...<eos> You are the Keelers.
Mickey!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Tom Ronstadt, as I live and breathe!<eos> Mickey Eldridge.<eos> Look at you.
Oh, my God!<eos> Tom Ronstadt, as I live and breathe!<eos> Mickey Eldridge.<eos> Look at you.<eos> Look at you. Look at you! Mental Mickey.
- Hello, ma'am.<eos> - Hello.<eos> Could we talk to Guy Catoul?<eos> He's not here.<eos> Who are you?
That's why Johnny D's room was searched.<eos> This guy is trying to get back the evidence that could link him to Lindsey's murder.<eos> Lindsey had this way about her.<eos> She just made everyone around her... happier.<eos> Listen, I-I can't imagine what you guys have been through, losing a daughter.
I don't want you to worry.<eos> We're going to do everything we can.<eos> You're daughter is going to be all right.<eos> She'll come back to the tennis court sooner than you may realize.<eos> And you won't even remember all this.
Better sooner than later. Right?<eos> Because if it's not meant to be, Then you're just setting up yourself And everyone around you for a whole lot of heartache.<eos> Am I making any sense?<eos> Actually, a lot.<eos> ♪ This peace ♪ You guys must be so excited about tomorrow. Very.
Oh, I get it. I get it.<eos> He's one of them understanding types, right?<eos> Oh, that explains why you don't want to get on that plane.<eos> And that thing you do, where you run your mouth off without, uh, thinking -- That explains a lot, too.<eos> You are with the police? Yes.
How -- How can we be overdrawn?<eos> I can't answer that. I -<eos> - How -- Are you sure?<eos> Yes, quite.<eos> But I can send you a duplicate of the statement, which you should have already received.
Well, I think that's great.<eos> You're a matchmaker. Just seeing them happy makes me happy.<eos> When I first met you in the hospital sitting with Grayson, that's the first thing I noticed... your compassion.<eos> Well, your eyes... then your compassion.<eos> Are you two ready?
Jake's nine-year-old son died during routine oral surgery, and a heartbroken Jake decided to sue.<eos> That's all.<eos> Jake came to our firm, and we helped him sue the dentist.<eos> That was a year ago.<eos> And as you know, that suit was adjudicated by Judge Philip Ellerbee.
We'll do everything we can to help.<eos> So, Mr Watson.<eos> Well, we all just came back up to change after the wedding.<eos> May I take your leis?<eos> Can I offer you a cocktail?
Let us go.<eos> Officers?<eos> No, hey, thank you. Officers, we'll take it from here.<eos> Mr. Buteau.<eos> Mr. and Mrs. Buteau, we apologize, clearly our colleagues had no idea who you were.
- What a bitch!<eos> - Yeah, I am a bitch!<eos> I'm a tough, brave bitch.<eos> And if you let me, I will turn all of these girls into tough brave bitches too. Who could go all the way to the championship.<eos> Now if you don't mind, I'm going to take my team, whoever's still on it, out for a run.
You killed him.<eos> These are all the witnesses from the bar.<eos> What is going on?<eos> Let's find out.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, could I have you all stand against the wall, please?
I didn't know what to do.<eos> And when we got through there, we ran to some apartments, and, you know, I<eos> - I carried Perry half the way, but, I mean, we got to the apartment.<eos> You<eos> - You dealt with it like real tough men.
Plays tennis. I want you to close him.<eos> Consider it done.<eos> Then you are officially dismissed for the evening.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Well, you two seem to be celebrating something. Mmm-hmm.
You know it will.<eos> I guess.<eos> I bet my life on it.<eos> It's not fair you got ALS in the first place.<eos> And it's definitely not fair you had side effects from the drug I created and I didn't.
I bet my life on it.<eos> It's not fair you got ALS in the first place.<eos> And it's definitely not fair you had side effects from the drug I created and I didn't.<eos> But now that I know they exist, I wanna fix them.<eos> So that people like you... And maybe even you, can have what I have right now.
Hawks will cover it.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> You don't have to do that.<eos> Again, part of the team.<eos> I'll keep you updated.
Every penny we had.<eos> Why didn't you tell us earlier?<eos> Well, cos I was trying to spare Abigail any more pain.<eos> It's all connected, isn't it? It's to do with his debts.<eos> When did you find out about this?
Chicagoans arrived in droves to express outrage.<eos> During the three town hall sessions.<eos> There are growing fears tonight about groundwater in Bensenville, where researchers' findings thus far have unleashed a stream of speculation from scientists.<eos> Take a look at WLOZ's exclusive graphic.<eos> As you can see, rainwater mixes with the buried toxic chemicals and seeps into the groundwater that acts as Bensenville's main water supply.
Robyn: No, just... Youcan'tdo that.<eos> Do you know what I was sitting on?<eos> Shouldn't have shown him your card.<eos> I didn't show him my cards.<eos> I'm gonna have to ask you two to sit out the next hand.
How many people know the combination to open it?<eos> Well, I do, of course.<eos> And my wife.<eos> That's it?<eos> Just the two of you?
Do you keep cyanide in your poisons cupboard?<eos> Yes, but all dangerous chemicals and poisons are kept under lock and key here, away from the children.<eos> How many keys are there?<eos> Just the one. Mine.<eos> So as you'll see, all the chemicals are here.
Her death was tragic, criminal intent, but it was suicide, that's all.<eos> Poor woman.<eos> So that's it, that's what you're saying?<eos> We're free to go?<eos> Absolutely, you're free to go.
I know. That's-that's why I'm concerned.<eos> I think... I feel like there's something wrong.<eos> Well, I'm sure it's just gas.<eos> So let's just take a look, and make sure that everything is perfect.<eos> And you're sure about the time line?
Are you in charge here?<eos> I am.<eos> My name's Lieutenant Caine.<eos> Look, one of your officers said that you found our daughter's body here.<eos> Are you Ellie's parents?
Well, then, it appears I have a decision to make.<eos> Flip a coin.<eos> When it's in the air, you'll know which side you're hoping for.<eos> With the greengrocer right up the street.<eos> And, if you're churchgoing people?
Maybe they hadn't thought of it.<eos> Wake up!<eos> You're faking it, we all know it.<eos> Oh. I didn't know she had visitors.<eos> Are you family?
They see what they want to see.<eos> Women, however, see into the soul of a person.<eos> Is this what you do?<eos> Entrap employers?<eos> That said, I understand the stress you two are under.
Chief Green insisted I was drunk.<eos> I was not.<eos> But she would not listen to reason.<eos> Did you have any contact with Chief Green after your arrest?<eos> Can I get you something to drink? It's very hot.
Actually, my family's from Spain. Yeah.<eos> All the better.<eos> I find European Hispanics vastly superior.<eos> This is a classic L.A. Victorian, built in the 1920s by a doctor to the stars.<eos> As you can see, it's just fabulous.
Well, at least they weren't murdered.<eos> Mrs. Ramos.<eos> Yes?<eos> I'd be happy to show you another house.<eos> But no matter where you go, you'll be moving into somebody's history.
You look, uh, marginally rested.<eos> I was hoping I'd actually get to REM sleep tonight.<eos> There's another detective, maybe you can go back to bed.<eos> That's weird. Sac P.D. called for our help on this.<eos> - You two CBI?
We know you went to Ayla's apartment.<eos> You're looking at manslaughter, kid.<eos> Get on your feet.<eos> Get up.<eos> And obstruction of justice for you two.
Breaklng news out of Wyatt Junction, Colorado.<eos> A major fire has erupted at the Wyatt Oil Field.<eos> Reports are coming In that several explosions have rocked the hillside.<eos> Our news team has captured this unedited footage on the scene.<eos> As you can see, the hillside behind me is completely engulfed in flames.
Come on, boy.<eos> There he is!<eos> Freeze!<eos> Cuff him!<eos> 'As you can see behind me, authorities have now located 'the abandoned Vermont Correctional vehicle 'that was carrying John Kozlowski, the convicted child killer 'who is serving 25 years in jail.'
With no reprieve coming from the governor's office, sodium thiopental was first administered as an anesthetic.<eos> Can I have two... two more shots, please?<eos> Would you like me to change the channel?<eos> No, that's and Mr. Kinkirk was pronounced dead at 18 minutes past the hour.<eos> As you've just heard, Joseph Kinkirk has been put to death in a Missouri state prison...
Whether what I saw was a genuine glimpse of the afterlife... or just a concussed fantasy, I'll probably never know.<eos> I arrive at the end of my journey with as many question as I started with.<eos> I certainly never imagined I would be exposed... to that kind of prejudice and close-mindedness.<eos> We obviously still have a long way to go... before we will be able to deal with death and what follows... in anything approaching a sensible fashion."<eos> Okay, so if you want to buy my book, I can sign it. You're welcome.
You gave them everything in your purse.<eos> Lyuba, that was wrong.<eos> I couldn't help it.<eos> I couldn't help it.<eos> Won't you please come and drink a glass as a goodbye?
You know what?<eos> I'd kiss the ground you walk on if you lived in a cleaner neighborhood.<eos> And now, the moment we've all been waiting for.<eos> Especially our contestants.<eos> The grand prize, as you all know, is 500 pesos plus a one-month contract at the Hotel Nacional.
I've written music for you.<eos> Sanna!<eos> I'll need your help.<eos> Can you come down?<eos> Why don't you come up here, you fascist pig?
No, we need to get her to a hospital.<eos> I've seen people react, but not 10 hours after the fact in my hotel room.<eos> Their farm is 5 miles away from the hotel, and how did she even know where l was staying?<eos> is there a doctor around? We have a little girl who's sick.<eos> Well, yes, but what.. . Hey, where are you going with that camera?
--the weather. There's a bit of sunshine-- Temperatures rising into 70s for the afternoon but we can expect to see some more of those rain showers by evening time as another front moves in from the south.<eos> Outlook for the week continues to be rather gloomy.<eos> Temperatures cooling down....<eos> So, what do you do when all this is done?<eos> So if you were planning on going to the beach anytime soon you might--
-ls he following us?<eos> -l don't think so.<eos> Do you see it?<eos> There. Over there.<eos> When we get out of here I want you to take this car and go, okay?
We are of course aware of that.<eos> It's not an easy situation for Elias...<eos> With you, Anton, who travels a lot.<eos> It must be hard for Elias, that his father is away so often.<eos> And if there are other problems between you...
Do you fight very often?<eos> How about a boyfriend?<eos> Someone you didn't know at all, one she could've run off with?<eos> Yes, well.<eos> I think it'd be best if you would wait here at home until she turns up again.
I think it'd be best if you would wait here at home until she turns up again.<eos> She'll come home again.<eos> - Don't fuck with us!<eos> I know it's difficult for you.<eos> We can also provide psychological support, if you'd like.
And I want you to accept that.<eos> Have I ever given up when it comes to you?<eos> Never.<eos> So what makes you think I'm going to start now?<eos> -Are you ready to hear today's special?
I think we spoke on the phone.<eos> This is my brother, Ronnie.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - He's Linda's husband.<eos> - Are you all ready?
Brothers we must hurry<eos> CITY OF SKY WOLVES<eos> Stop<eos> Xuan Wu<eos> You deliver the Seal
It was an astronomical calculator aligned on the axis... of the summer and winter solstice.<eos> Who built it remains a mystery, as well as how any ancient civilization... could have moved these massive stones, some weighing as much as 50 tones.<eos> - Oh, oh. - Oh, my god.<eos> Hey, look at the altar stone.<eos> I'm Dr. Jacob Glaser and you are listening to the real story.
This is John and he'll be staying with me tonight.<eos> So do we pay per night or per person?<eos> That depends if you're sharing the same room.<eos> Oh, we'll be sharing.<eos> Then it won't cost you any extra..
good morning, ladies and gentlemen.<eos> And how are we enjoying our stay?<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> Liam ulrich, the new hotel manager, At your service.<eos> If you'll forgive me, I've been instructed by the management To secure the stairs to the roof.
Yes. Your friend's a real fighter.<eos> She's hanging in there.<eos> How? She got hit by a plane!<eos> The doctors couldn't believe it either.<eos> I don't know if you're religious, but now would be the time to pray.
It just puts you in a better position in regards to custody. Two children, you said?<eos> Yes.<eos> Holly here, and then I have a son in high school, Walter Jr.<eos> - They need to stay with me. - Okay.<eos> - How long have you been married?
I just need to get one more picture of that abrasion.<eos> This is fucking insane.<eos> It's okay. We're here.We're here now.<eos> Mr. and Mrs. Cameron, I'm Gail Friedman. I'm a counselor with the hospital.<eos> I'm glad you're here.
We've only just left and I do not need a break.<eos> This isn't a break.<eos> This is a test. You should be strong enough to do this.<eos> Do what?<eos> Madame, monsieur, I believe you have the seven o'clock reservation.

!<eos> You think this farm is more important to me than my own son?<eos> He was my son!<eos> My husband hasn't left this farm in over two years.<eos> What are you talking about?
Guess that will certainly justify his parents removing themselves from the world.<eos> Can't blame them now.<eos> But what Levi discovered... the gift he had... would their God really want them to deny their son that?<eos> Levi planned to return.<eos> We thought it was important that you knew that.

Is that your position, that this bill, if it were to be passed, would interfere directly with interest rates... setting interest rates?<eos> If we were to raise interest rates at a meeting, and someone in the Congress didn't like that, and said,<eos> "I want the GAO to audit that decision," wouldn't that be viewed as an interference?<eos> I would...<eos> I wouldn't think so.

Thank you so much for coming.<eos> I don't think we've ever been at a reception table with a nanny before.<eos> Have we, Jerry?<eos> Only very good or very bad nannies are remembered so many years later.<eos> Which one are you?
Eloise, what's your connection to the bride and groom?<eos> Right, yeah, that's the sort of question you ask back here.<eos> It's not gonna be what you want to hear.<eos> It won't be what she wants to hear.<eos> You're Jo Flanagan, right? You're the nanny.

It seems to give him comfort.<eos> I should have been told.<eos> It changes the situation.<eos> It may indicate a far more serious condition.<eos> You don't believe in such voices?
And yet he has still said nothing.<eos> It's for me to protect him, and now I have made things worse.<eos> She wants me here... to take care of Jakob... and to take care of you.<eos> The voice is real.<eos> You're mad.
You're mad.<eos> Yes.<eos> You said it yourself- serious condition.<eos> I should have paid closer attention.<eos> Instead of helping Jakob, you've made yourself unwell.
- I must leave.<eos> - No.<eos> Sir, she's given me her illness.<eos> You have a fever.<eos> You don't have to leave.
I'm so afraid.<eos> Lilia... where is she?<eos> ' Who?<eos> Lilia.<eos> What do you mean?

- A prodigy, really.<eos> - You see every now and then, someone crosses our path who will change the world as we know it.<eos> Andy is one of those people.<eos> I hope you will support all of our efforts to protect what makes him so very special.<eos> We're so pleased that you could visit.

But you've met him?<eos> He came around here once.<eos> Did he... hurt you... in any way?<eos> That'd be a mistake.<eos> It would be very helpful for us if you would be willing to sign some papers that would attest that you felt threatened by him.

Nothing to be ashamed about.<eos> It happens all the time.<eos> - You don't know him like I do.<eos> - I don't need to.<eos> But you came to me and I'm giving you my professional opinion.
Yeah, I know the drill.<eos> Ms. Jones, can...<eos> Look, there's no easy way to say this.<eos> I read your file.<eos> I know who you are.
Ms. Jones, can...<eos> Look, there's no easy way to say this.<eos> I read your file.<eos> I know who you are.<eos> What you can do.
Drugs?<eos> You know, gambling, weird fetish shit?<eos> Was there any world - that he was a part of? - No.<eos> No.<eos> Why? What did you see?
- What?<eos> - This is Duncan and Dotter Design.<eos> Oh, right, this is her.<eos> Sorry.<eos> - Um, can you come in this afternoon?
There was an organization that did business with us last year.<eos> - We did lots of business.<eos> - Yeah, they call themselves the Hand.<eos> - You need help spelling that?<eos> - Look, whatever you heard, it's true.
- Anything from this year?<eos> - Not that I've done.<eos> How about any other architect in your firm?<eos> Just because it's really important for our brand that we're not only on the cutting edge, but we are the cutting edge.<eos> Yes, but... can you keep a secret?
He can't admit when he's done something wrong.<eos> You can't admit when you done something right.<eos> Uh, Cole wanted me to bring these to you.<eos> They're lotto tickets.<eos> He said he wanted you to know he was thinking about you.
Um, throw the rest away.<eos> Maybe I could give it to the church instead?<eos> Give it to the church, that sounds good,<eos> I don't know what i was thinking.<eos> You're mourning.
- Yes, ma'am.<eos> Hello, miss Stella.<eos> Bratt, there's a break in the fence,<eos> I think there's some wild horses on the property.<eos> - All right, where are you?
You done now, you little shitter?<eos> Only three left, including buster.<eos> I ain't worried.<eos> He'll stick close to home.<eos> What are you doing here?
- Your mom's not gonna water the plants.<eos> - Oh.<eos> She has a very nurturing nature.<eos> She would...<eos> Oh, Mrs. Mac, are you gonna water the plants?
May I?<eos> Sure.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Um, I'm Ana.<eos> But you knew that already because you said my last name.
You know, she could be expelled.<eos> God. I hope not.<eos> But if any first-time offenders got expelled, well I guess fair is fair.<eos> Are you gonna take this serously? Sure.<eos> You don't bluff me. I don't bluff you.
I know. You can't hit people.<eos> That will be made very clear.<eos> I get that. But Miss Davis, if we seperate our leaders... If we segregate them from people like you and me... you get congressman.<eos> So I'm sorry. I wish I can take you offer, but Mary stays.<eos> Unless you kick her out.
I mean, if we adopt standards based on our friend's aversion to palmetto bugs... we won't have a child left side of Tallahassee.<eos> All right, last chance before this starts cost a lot more money.<eos> Your Honor, my client would need reasonable acess to the child.<eos> So ordered.<eos> Ms. Dibbons, would you go out and check the living conditions?
There you are. Yeah, can I help you?<eos> Yes.<eos> Doctor Shankland.<eos> I'm really sorry. I can't hear you.<eos> Could you speak up, please?
I don't drink.<eos> Have we met?<eos> No, but I have been watching you.<eos> Following your career.<eos> You are Dr... Isabel Maru.
You are Dr... Isabel Maru.<eos> The most talented chemist in the German army.<eos> I am a friend.<eos> I hope I'm not causing any...<eos> I know you and General Ludendorff are... very close.
I mean, are they here already?<eos> I don't have all the information so I don't want to tell you anything that might not be true.<eos> Somebody will be right in to speak with you.<eos> Okay.<eos> What do you mean?
I don't have all the information so I don't want to tell you anything that might not be true.<eos> Somebody will be right in to speak with you.<eos> Okay.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> What do you mean?
Shall we refer our opinions to Dr Gin?<eos> Who on earth is that?<eos> Countess?<eos> I thought you'd be alone.<eos> Well, as you can see, I am not.
Who on earth is that?<eos> Countess?<eos> I thought you'd be alone.<eos> Well, as you can see, I am not.<eos> What do you want?
Well, as you can see, I am not.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Well, I believe we have an appointment.<eos> My only appointment is with intoxication.<eos> As you may recall, I represent a company which produces products which restore and enhance female beauty.
What do you want?<eos> Well, I believe we have an appointment.<eos> My only appointment is with intoxication.<eos> As you may recall, I represent a company which produces products which restore and enhance female beauty.<eos> And also a certain feminine product, which you may prefer to discuss in private.
And also a certain feminine product, which you may prefer to discuss in private.<eos> I don't recall.<eos> Pixie, perhaps as well as medicine for your poor, worn-out chuff, the lady may have something to repair a faulty memory.<eos> Do you have a beauty product which would bag me an admiral?<eos> I have a product which would allow you to accommodate an entire fleet, without discomfort, admiral and rear admiral.
Well, if my likeness was in there, the drawer wasn't empty.<eos> If the paperwork from Dublin is validated, Miss Bow will have a legal claim against his estate as widow.<eos> Mrs Delaney is my name.<eos> Bow was the name that I used for the stage.<eos> Are you a good actress?
And was that before or after he lost his mind?<eos> Well, love is a kind of madness, isn't it, Mr Thoyt?<eos> Or have you never experienced it?<eos> My father was a very sick and old man.<eos> Do you have proof of consummation?
The outcome persuaded us you should be courted instead.<eos> What will the gorilla do with the lady, one wonders.<eos> Eat her, perhaps!<eos> Where did they go?<eos> Countess, I know this is business. And I think I know who you are.
- Not before a performance.<eos> - There'll be no performance tonight.<eos> There will be a performance or there will be a riot in Covent Garden.<eos> Until the necessary arrangements have been made, I advise that you go absolutely nowhere.<eos> As of now, you are a weakness.
There will be a performance or there will be a riot in Covent Garden.<eos> Until the necessary arrangements have been made, I advise that you go absolutely nowhere.<eos> As of now, you are a weakness.<eos> These fantasies elude me...<eos> If you go outside, they will find you and they will find a use for you.
Come, come.<eos> If you could take me to Old Street, I'll find a cab.<eos> You looked to be fleeing from someone.<eos> You were following me?<eos> You have many suitors among the rabble, I imagine, and I, for the longest time, have been one of them.
That bitch is on the gallows... before Mass!<eos> Down there.<eos> Perhaps now you will listen to me.<eos> This diamond... this is yours.<eos> I have a man that will take you to Paris and you will stay there until this business is done.

You're welcome.<eos> Hey, can I smoke in here?<eos> No, there's no smoking allowed.<eos> Detective macklay, You know how good a cigarette would taste with this coffee?<eos> Smoke 'em if you got 'em.
Uh, it's turkey, not beef.<eos> Is it smoked?<eos> Uh, I-I think so.<eos> It's the same as beef jerky, except it's made from turkey.<eos> Were you here when they first came?
are two very different things.<eos> Maybe they're not.<eos> I mean, if you don't care how I feel about one then maybe you're not ready to do the other.<eos> Hello?<eos> Are you sure?
- Mommy's gonna build a house.<eos> Mrs. Dupont.<eos> It is so nice to meet you.<eos> Thank you. Thank you for this opportunity<eos> I promise that you wont regret it.
Let's not forget theft.<eos> Where's the money?<eos> Margot.<eos> The FBI may have received an anonymous tip regarding a stolen painting.<eos> Miss Vaughan, you are under arrest for the following federal felony offenses...
- What I did?<eos> I walked in on her helping the prisoner!<eos> They ran at me and slammed the grate on me!<eos> Is this true?<eos> Ma'am, I've been preparing your tea all morning, just like you asked.
And who'd be responsible for that?<eos> You and your useless army.<eos> 'I'm in charge of your personal security, Sergeant Nawab Malik!<eos> And that dog, Major General Harding!<eos> 'Miss Julia, we will provide you with better security than the King of England.'
Stealing from a running train.<eos> - Wow!<eos> 'Queen of the Express'!<eos> Are you excited?<eos> Ms. Julia, where are you?
I am so sorry.<eos> Uh, we had no choice.<eos> Except maybe that last one.<eos> That was a little excessive.<eos> Do you have a vacuum?
And you are...<eos> Miss.<eos> I'd rather not be mistaken for a madam.<eos> It's Barbara Barga, New York Times.<eos> Have you been in London long?
You must be important.<eos> Yet you just walked away from the scene of a crime.<eos> I saw you.<eos> What is the crime?<eos> Well, from the way you disappeared, I thought you'd guessed.
What is the crime?<eos> Well, from the way you disappeared, I thought you'd guessed.<eos> Foul play.<eos> Isn't that what you call it over here?<eos> You don't seem surprised.
I married him.<eos> Any progress on that murder case?<eos> But what the hell, you didn't ask me to dance to talk about murder cases, did you?<eos> I'm going to be very offended if you say yes to that one, mister.<eos> Are you still married?
Your own car.<eos> You must be important.<eos> That's what people keep telling me.<eos> You know they've had 14 break-ins along here in the last three months.<eos> Well, I can stand by the window if you like.
And frankly, he doesn't show any of the classic signs of a bullying personality.<eos> He's not narcissistic.<eos> And he certainly demonstrates empathy and sensitivity.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Are you sure?
You have any headache?<eos> You feel sleepy or groggy?<eos> - No.<eos> - Are you sure?<eos> - Mm-hmm. - We can do a CAT scan if you want...
Hi, this is Dr. Melissa Francis from Maui Memorial Hospital.<eos> I was your attending physician while you were here.<eos> I'm just following up on your lab results.<eos> Your myocarditis was caused by a viral infection.<eos> You seem to have a very weak immune system.
Madeline!<eos> We're not sure about the state of your immune system.<eos> We think it's possible that it's underdeveloped, like an infant's.<eos> It hasn't been exposed to common viruses or bacterial infections.<eos> You don't have S.C.I.D.
Thank you. You too, man.<eos> You, uh, ever play golf?<eos> Mmm, once, a few years ago. I wasn't very good.<eos> Gordon was a professional golfer for years.<eos> Oh, you kiddin'?
Lila's daughter was in school when her parents died.<eos> She dropped out, went to the city, put half of Peru up her nose, had a child out of wedlock.<eos> Anyway, I know what it's like<eos> - to have... - Let me stop you there.<eos> I know what you're doing... trying to tug at my heartstrings, using your grandchildren as props.
When the whole Sunny custody thing is happening... my ex had his lawyer, high-priced lawyer.<eos> I'm there, no lawyer... totally confused about the situation.<eos> I'm tatted.<eos> Judge is looking at what my line of work is.<eos> At one point, she put her papers down, looked me square in the eyes and said, you know, "What happened to you in your childhood"
It's not, Mr. Pratters, I assure you.<eos> It is a character-building questionnaire that assesses personal strengths and weaknesses.<eos> Excuse me, Mrs. Bradley?<eos> Yes, Clay.<eos> How important was it to you to help Hannah Baker?
What candidate?<eos> You want me to administrate Nassau?<eos> These are the terms under which it will happen.<eos> They are the best I can offer.<eos> Are they acceptable to you?
Right. Blimey.<eos> Last time I saw you, you just weed your pants all over my sofa.<eos> I'm Adam Stuart's mum.<eos> Ah, hi, Mrs Stuart.<eos> Yeah, he said you might pop in.
You're not me.<eos> Go home, Benjamin. - Well, I... Wha...<eos> - What?<eos> Ezekiel's gonna keep coming out here to check on you.<eos> He doesn't want to bug you, but he needs to know that you're okay.
No. But I know him.<eos> Well, tell him...<eos> I can't.<eos> He looks out for the people that he cares about.<eos> Do you want some food?
I did my homework on you.<eos> You got a good reputation.<eos> People respect you.<eos> I just want to be with people who do things the right way.<eos> You do things the right way.
I'm looking forward to new challenges in local government.<eos> I see.<eos> I only hope I'll share the same excellent working relationship with your successor.<eos> I can't tell you how much I respect him.<eos> I know you leave Fortitude a much better place than you found it.
I was summoned by him in a failed attempt to extort money from me.<eos> I would hope that your spy also informed you that four of my six men attempted to arrest him and died in the effort.<eos> I was barely able to escape myself.<eos> Surely this should mitigate any doubt you may have about my loyalties.<eos> If you were loyal to the governor, why did you not inform me of the meeting before the fact?
This is outrageous.<eos> When the governor returns, he will not stand for this.<eos> The governor is not here.<eos> I am here.<eos> And you are now under an indictment that carries with it the penalty of death.
- to my sources... - Give me the names.<eos> - Such that I might continue... - Give me the names. - To serve his regime in the future...<eos> - As I have served it every day... - Give me the names. - Until now.<eos> - Give me the names!<eos> You can't go in there, ma'am.
And who is that serving?<eos> Because there is a better way to solve this problem.<eos> What is that?<eos> This is information about the preferred routes used by the resistance to enter into Nassau.<eos> - She gave it to you?
This is the problem right here.<eos> It's not even a proper police station.<eos> Where do you keep prisoners?<eos> There's a store room, computer boxes, paper towels, or we drive 'em 10 miles to Paynesville.<eos> Wait, you said computer boxes.
Where are the computers?<eos> They're in the boxes. Chief doesn't like computers.<eos> Well, old chief.<eos> Sorry, Chief.<eos> Oh, you don't like them?
I'm gonna go ahead and pretend you didn't just mouth off to me like my teenage daughter.<eos> And I'm gonna go ahead and let you brace your witness. And then I'm gonna let you take a few days off to grieve.<eos> But this is a done deal.<eos> You're being absorbed by the county.<eos> You work for me now. So, when you get back, you and the Chief, me,
How do you mean?<eos> Oh, Chief, new chief's real angry.<eos> Said you didn't have permission to go. Said county's not gonna pay for the trip.<eos> I never asked 'em to.<eos> Well, he wants you to come back.
Two brothers, a traffic skirmish, a dead man in another county.<eos> Mere what?<eos> All named Stussy.<eos> You see, in 1932 there were, what, 24 Hitlers in a German phone book.<eos> Now, are you suggesting that they were all responsible for the Final Solution?
We got our man.<eos> That's an order.<eos> Is it gonna be much longer?<eos> I gotta be downtown in an hour.<eos> No. You can go.
I told you what happened, what I did.<eos> I want no special treatment just 'cause I'm rich.<eos> You treat me like every other felon.<eos> No, you're not getting it. Somebody came, just not who you thought.<eos> What are you talking about?
Surmise.<eos> Because I haven't greeted you, I don't remember you.<eos> Do you?<eos> We may have met once in my younger days.<eos> Are you familiar with the Russian saying,
She did steal P.J.'s program.<eos> How could you be right about that?<eos> I don't have that part of it figured out yet.<eos> All I know is it wasn't God.<eos> Whenever you're ready.
Then what is it?<eos> Uh... I was just still saving up for the materials.<eos> I should have asked if it was okay if I slept here.<eos> If I pay for the materials, will that help?<eos> I can't... I can't let you do that.
Hi. This is Marius Josepovich.<eos> I had an appointment today with Mr. Mr. Bagwell at 2:00, and I've had a little bit of an emergency.<eos> I was wondering if there was any chance to reschedule perhaps later today.<eos> Mr. Bagwell doesn't like us to change times.<eos> I'm sorry. Could you hold on for one sec?
Saul calls it conclusive.<eos> Mr. Berenson does.<eos> Yes.<eos> How soon before they actually have a weapon?<eos> Well, as you're aware, the North Koreans already do.
Madame President-elect...<eos> So that's what you think I'm going to do.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - Accommodate terrorism and the states that sponsor it.<eos> So you've seen the Times.
Nancy.<eos> Madam President, can you tell us where you've been the last two days?<eos> No, I can't.<eos> But I want to thank the dedicated people who looked after my safety and the safety of this great city.<eos> There are some reports suggesting that you yourself were the target of the attack.
Oh, they're all in Raqqa, or wherever, bringin' on the end of the world over there with their goats!<eos> If you stop pushing back against them here, every minute, if you are that stupid, what do you get?<eos> That's what you get!<eos> Madame President-elect, I hope you're listening, and if you are, hear me now.<eos> You brought this down on us.
If you stop pushing back against them here, every minute, if you are that stupid, what do you get?<eos> That's what you get!<eos> Madame President-elect, I hope you're listening, and if you are, hear me now.<eos> You brought this down on us.<eos> You did.
And I can't take it anymore.<eos> I won't take it anymore.<eos> And I am not alone.<eos> I am not alone.<eos> If you want a fight, and apparently you do--
You can speak with specific people in the White House, including the president.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It's a start.<eos> Please.<eos> I'd like to bring you up to speed on the attack and a few unfortunate facts you should be aware of.
Ma'am, the fact is the blast happened less than 20 blocks from your hotel.<eos> You're not saying he was heading toward me.<eos> We just don't know.<eos> Thank God he never reached his destination.<eos> But this was a man who hated the US government. You are the premiere symbol of that government in New York at the moment.
You were proud of him.<eos> Oh, yes. Very much so.<eos> He loved his country. He believed in the mission.<eos> He was... the light of my life, and I miss him every single moment of every day.<eos> What was he like? What can you tell us about him?
You couldn't talk Andrew out of anything, not once his mind was made up.<eos> And once he graduated, he served three tours in Iraq?<eos> Two full tours.<eos> He was killed just at the beginning of his third.<eos> And by then, you had come out against the war.
There was all this craziness at my house, and somebody called your agency, one of the neighbors or<eos> - a parent from Franny's school.<eos> - Ms. Mathison...<eos> But they don't know me, and they don't know Franny, and they don't know what really happened.<eos> Well, that's why we're here so that you can tell me what happened.
Sorry.<eos> Lonas, when... when can I see her?<eos> What do I have to do?<eos> You're doing it.<eos> Y-You are... helping with the investigation.
That's not what her daughter said.<eos> Was the gun loaded, Ms. Mathison?<eos> Answer the question.<eos> Yes, it was.<eos> Putting aside for a moment whether or not you were asleep, can you explain what you were doing in your daughter's room with a loaded gun?
What is the agency's recommendation?<eos> Bottom line, Your Honor, Ms. Mathison fell asleep in her daughter's bedroom with a loaded gun.<eos> Our assessment is that, this fact alone meets the legal requirement of imminent risk.<eos> I'm going to accept the agency's recommendation.<eos> Ms. Mathison, you'll be required to undergo psychiatric evaluation.
If you don't mind my saying, I'm impressed.<eos> Whatever you think, I'm not an ideologue.<eos> I really do care about the security of this country.<eos> As do I.<eos> Which is why I want to be absolutely clear about the scope of this contingency plan you're asking for.
My name is Steve Beverly.<eos> I'm the videographer with Manhattan Legal Support.<eos> Also present is Robert Emmons, Chief of Staff for the president-elect, and George Pallis, the Solicitor General of the United States.<eos> I will now swear in the witness.<eos> Ms. Mathison, do you affirm you will testify to the truth, to the best of your ability, or swear to it, so help you God?
Because this... friction between us... it has to end.<eos> And you think this would help end the... friction?<eos> I know it would.<eos> Three candidates I would never consider for any position at any time.<eos> I'm sorry you feel that way.
He found out you were advising me, and he got to you, just like he got to Majid Javadi before.<eos> Tell me what he's holding over your head.<eos> Is it your daughter?<eos> You asked me about that situation.<eos> And you said you couldn't get involved.
- You're wrong.<eos> - I don't think so.<eos> And I don't think the President will, either.<eos> Slow down, ma'am.<eos> - Where are you going?
He was running toward a fallen comrade to save that man's life.<eos> That act, which was attested to by six soldiers who were actually there-- that act cost my son his life and won him the Silver Star.<eos> Whoever made the video is not only trying to undo that and damage him personally, but to damage my presidency.<eos> I call on the actual cowards, the people who made it, to come out of the shadows and show their faces.<eos> Madam President-Elect, are you calling this a conspiracy against you?
Madam President-Elect, are you calling this a conspiracy against you?<eos> I am asking the people who made the video to acknowledge it.<eos> But you are calling the men in the video liars? Yes, I am.<eos> And I'm calling on the media to do their jobs and check their facts.<eos> Are you aware of the petitioning to have your son's body removed from Arlington Cemetery?
And I'm calling on the media to do their jobs and check their facts.<eos> Are you aware of the petitioning to have your son's body removed from Arlington Cemetery?<eos> - Well, they've collected a quarter-million signatures online.<eos> What about the rumor that your nominee for Secretary of Defense has withdrawn his name?<eos> As far as I know, you are starting that rumor yourself - right now.

I'm dealing with it.<eos> You should have told me.<eos> What's he doing here?<eos> He has something important to talk to you about. What?<eos> I think you should hear it from him.
He says he's responding to your call to come out of hiding.<eos> He wants to discuss it with you on his show this afternoon.<eos> No debate, no prep, just two people talking.<eos> His words.<eos> Which, obviously, you don't want to do.
We wouldn't be aware of any of this if it weren't for you.<eos> So?<eos> Honestly... it's hard to listen to what's said in this room, 'cause what I'm not hearing is a plan.<eos> "Follow the money," which... believe me, will be much harder than you think.<eos> That's what you'll be doing when the world rolls right over you.
Truth." Special because my guest is the next president of the United States,<eos> Elizabeth Keane.<eos> Welcome, Madam President-Elect.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So, let me ask you what everyone is asking right now-- why are you here?
Welcome, Madam President-Elect.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So, let me ask you what everyone is asking right now-- why are you here?<eos> Because you invited me.<eos> Well, I've often invited you, but, usually, you prefer the loving arms of the mainstream media.
And I have to ask, why would you want to make a mother-- any mother-- watch the last moments of her son's life?<eos> I know it must be painful for you and I-I'm sorry.<eos> But I want to be clear about this.<eos> You say-- You say it's not true.<eos> Are you accusing these men of lying?
You must have it.<eos> You know why I produced the video?<eos> To destroy the memory of my son, to hurt me, and to damage my presidency.<eos> No, no, and no.<eos> I produced the video because some people-- people you call cowards, though every one of them's a veteran-- came to me with a story of injustice.
Hey. You broke your promise.<eos> It's time to pay up.<eos> - Can you tell me your name?<eos> - Alex Reid.<eos> And where you?
Uh, yes. Another time, my friend.<eos> Can you prep her for surgery?<eos> I gotta talk to the mother.<eos> Mrs. Summerville?<eos> - Yes. Are you the doctor? - Mm-hmm.
She's been brought up to an operating room.<eos> She's okay, right?<eos> I mean, she's going to be okay?<eos> Well, she is in serious condition.<eos> Why don't you have a seat?
He looked so calm and at peace.<eos> And all of a sudden, he just kind of faded out like he was on a dimmer.<eos> And, um-- and he was gone.<eos> And it was beautiful.<eos> So, you just happened to be awake and looking right at him at the exact moment that he, uh, dimmed out?
Can you wiggle your fingers, make a fist?<eos> Good as new.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Miss Durst, I'm sorry if this seems inappropriate, but when you came in last month to get the cast, one of the orderlies, he said he saw you in the parking lot before you came in.<eos> I'm sure it's just a misunderstanding, but he said that he saw you slam your car door on your arm on purpose.
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> May I help you, ma'am?
So, they had to leave Switzerland.<eos> The unit is mobile now.<eos> They don't stay in one place for too long.<eos> That was smart of them.<eos> I know what you're thinking.
I believe so.<eos> Taxi!<eos> Do you know when the bus is supposed to get here?<eos> Any minute now.<eos> Excuse me, miss? Are you a mother?
- "Take On Me."<eos> - Ja.<eos> - A-ha. - A-ha!<eos> Miss Durst.<eos> I am so sorry. I did not hear you come in.
So we're gonna simulate that now while we're monitoring you just to see how well you hold up.<eos> It'll just be for a few minutes.<eos> There's plenty of air in there.<eos> I am gonna close the lid, but you can get out at any time.<eos> If you wanna take your money in the box with you, that's fine.
- Yes.<eos> - Is it here in this building?<eos> No, it's not here.<eos> I'm happy to answer any other questions you may have about the device, technical or otherwise.<eos> Why haven't you used it?
No, it's not here.<eos> I'm happy to answer any other questions you may have about the device, technical or otherwise.<eos> Why haven't you used it?<eos> Everything I need is here.<eos> What about you?
Hi. Nice to see you girls.<eos> Come in, come in.<eos> I know I marked you off.<eos> Right. Hello.<eos> How are you today?
But Kevin, he'll come back.<eos> He always does.<eos> G'day. Miss Playford?<eos> No, sir.<eos> And who might you be?
You have been living in our home for some time now.<eos> I don't imagine there's much about my husband and I that you don't know.<eos> With the debt he owes, he is going to be fighting this fight for the rest of his life.<eos> And for as long as he is chained to this place, then I am as well.<eos> I wonder, ma'am, if he might want you to leave.
I have grown quite fond of you, ma'am.<eos> You are someone who is determined to be better today than you were yesterday.<eos> And in this world, that is in short supply.<eos> And so I find myself feeling protective of you.<eos> And if I am feeling that way, fearing the thought of you bearing a child in this environment...
It is our duty now to secure ourselves here.<eos> I think we're all properly angry about what he did on the Underhill estate, but Billy has influence that is best not ignored.<eos> Billy told me I should worry that you will be Madi's end.<eos> After you fled, reprisals were visited upon our loved ones upon the Edwards estate.<eos> I wonder, ma'am, if he might want you to leave when he learns of your current state of being.
Excuse me?<eos> The news you bring about Eleanor.<eos> It's that she's dead, isn't it?<eos> It is.<eos> And who are you?
Sir, stop!<eos> Please exit the building!<eos> Ready for me?<eos> Please exit the building!<eos> Ma'am, you have to leave the building.
Ms. Facchini.<eos> Mr. Bohm.<eos> I was hoping it'd be you.<eos> Why?<eos> Fuchs doesn't see what you are.
Not enough.<eos> The laws on this campus don't govern everyone fairly.<eos> Black and white students are treated differently.<eos> I understand your frustration, but their punishment had nothing to do with race. Oh, surprise!<eos> If you really believe that, then you're a part of the problem. Yeah!
Black and white students are treated differently.<eos> I understand your frustration, but their punishment had nothing to do with race. Oh, surprise!<eos> If you really believe that, then you're a part of the problem. Yeah!<eos> You're the problem!<eos> You!
The laws on campus suck and they need to change.<eos> - You need to do something!<eos> - You need to watch your tone.<eos> Don't tell me to watch my tone.<eos> If you don't get this,
Don't tell me to watch my tone.<eos> If you don't get this,<eos> - you need to step down. - Calm down.<eos> And don't tell me to calm down.<eos> Maybe you should be a little bit more upset!
Mrs. Miller.<eos> -I'm so very sorry.<eos> -Thank you.<eos> And I promise you, I will not stop until everyone responsible for this terrible tragedy is brought to justice.<eos> And I swear to you, as God is my witness... no one will ever harm you or your family ever again.
-You knew... even before he went to Pakistan.<eos> -I mean, you raised him.<eos> No. He had some problems. He got lost.<eos> -But no, nothing like this.<eos> -But you saw what he did, didn't you?
But you don't need to say very much.<eos> You just need to ask Josh to turn himself in.<eos> There are so many hardworking mothers and fathers out there.<eos> This could've happened to any of them.<eos> We are close to capturing your son, Ms. Masterson, and I will do my best to have you see him.
Great to see you.<eos> Thanks for coming out.<eos> Just go away!<eos> You have no idea what is happening in your own homes.<eos> Have you any idea where he is, Mrs. Masterson?
-Fuck.<eos> -That's right, Doug.<eos> "Fuck."<eos> It's difficult to underst--<eos> Well, perhaps if you could just calm down for a moment.
You meditate?<eos> No.<eos> That's a shame.<eos> Otto: Your friend is charged with driving his car over his cousin.<eos> Hope you don't mind me asking, but just out of curiosity, how'd you two meet, you and Mr. Collins?
They don't, usually.<eos> I'm here in an official capacity.<eos> Not seen much of you since the Wessex raid.<eos> When are you gonna give me the inside story?<eos> I'm sure you've spoken to everybody else.
On my wages?<eos> Gentlemen, if you take your places, the tournament can begin.<eos> Pawn to Queen's four.<eos> There will now be a short break.<eos> Dr Amory, do you have a moment?
It means you're still wearing yesterday's shirt, and that smudge of lipstick on your collar is the same shade Miss Knight's wearing.<eos> You've got about a second to lose that smirk before I slap it off your face.<eos> Did you pinch his notebook?<eos> You silly, silly girl.<eos> Do you know, I heard you were something once...
Is it Tessa?<eos> How bad?<eos> Her body was found at a house out by Binsey this morning.<eos> She'd been drowned.<eos> You didn't send her there?
I'm here. Right here.<eos> You can see me, right?<eos> Yes, I can see you, Corey.<eos> I've seen a lot of things at this school, even when other people have their eyes closed.<eos> Are you seeing anything right now?
'Hello, Rohan.<eos> Good morning!<eos> '<eos> Mrs. Mukherjee, good morning!<eos> How're you?
'<eos> I'll be there on time.<eos> Please don't worry. - 'Okay.'<eos> But Mrs. Mukherjee, it would be nice to have you there too.<eos> It was you who fixed this.
All right.<eos> Come on in.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Your brother Norman was kidnapped from the police station by Alex Romero.<eos> How the hell did you let that happen?
I have money, but that's all, I'm afraid.<eos> Let me speak to my supervisor.<eos> We can usually work something out.<eos> Did you lose your luggage, too?<eos> You...
Take two of these with some food.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> No.<eos> Hello, Mr. Wells.<eos> Who are you?
He would have done that already.<eos> He wants something.<eos> What is it, Mr. Wells?<eos> Is it the key?<eos> How do you know about the key?
That's very heavy work.<eos> Sister Ursula charged me with setting out the furniture.<eos> It is a necessary task, and one I do gladly.<eos> Pink ticket number 21.<eos> I think that will be you, Mrs Watts.
To Barbara's looming career as an inebriate clergy spouse.<eos> The lady of the house, if you would be so kind.<eos> Zelda, someone to see you.<eos> You come about the rum, dear?<eos> As you may observe, I am in uniform, therefore I won't imbibe.
Er, Mr Watts is not willing to allow Mrs Watts to remain in the property if the marriage is dissolved.<eos> I'm not paying you to know what my husband wants.<eos> I want to know what I can do.<eos> I thought you were supposed to be a midwife.<eos> Can't you stop that kid from whingeing?
Can we just talk?<eos> Can you just tell me why you won't listen to us?<eos> Professor, wait! Please, just...<eos> Why won't you meet with us?<eos> Why are you ignoring us?
If anyone looks at my hand, I'll know.<eos> Um... no...<eos> Tell me the truth.<eos> Is James okay?<eos> Maybe you'd like to sit down.
Uh, ma'am, I hate to tell you, but, uh, our records show that Dustin was fired from that job six months ago.<eos> No, you're wrong.<eos> He... he told me all about that job,<eos> - how well he was doing.<eos> - Ms. Doyle, you have Parkinson's, don't you?
I need to call my children.<eos> Their father's dead.<eos> I have to tell them their father's dead.<eos> I understand that, and I'm sorry for your loss, but that can't happen.<eos> Who the hell are you?
We are, Hanna.<eos> We are.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Hi... sorry.<eos> I just noticed you were coming out of Ezra Fitz's loft.
Can I just say one last thing?<eos> If you believed in your talent half as much as I do you would see this moment for what it is.<eos> Take it and run.<eos> Ms. McCullers?<eos> - Do you have a minute?
- She gets too close.<eos> And touchy, and it's not just me<eos> Chelsea Lopez is freaked out too.<eos> I took a picture at last Saturday's meet.<eos> I'll show you.
We need to talk.<eos> What is this about?<eos> This is about you, and where you were yesterday when you were supposed to be here.<eos> And what you're willing to do to protect a lie.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.
Did you know that they even have a camera in the elevator?<eos> We get it.<eos> There's lots of evidence.<eos> And there's probably more to come.<eos> But the question is, why are you telling us this?
And there's probably more to come.<eos> But the question is, why are you telling us this?<eos> I thought it was obvious.<eos> I am giving you a chance to tell your side of the story before my side becomes the only side.<eos> You were the one who rescued us five years ago.
- Can we talk?<eos> Always.<eos> I need to know what's going on with Hanna.<eos> You know, don't you?<eos> If Hanna doesn't want you to know...
So, you two could live here together?<eos> Well, when I'm not at the hotel.<eos> You know, as in, permanent.<eos> What... is..<eos> Um, I'm not sure I understand what you're asking.
So all four dead men were shot by Mr. Deaux here?<eos> That's right.<eos> Just comes in through the back window, blasting away, drops every one of them?<eos> Yep.<eos> Why you?
I, uh, I called earlier about a missing U.S. citizen<eos> - in the Middle East. - Yes.<eos> I'm Henry Kishida.<eos> Let me walk you to the director's office.<eos> It's an unusual situation, which you can appreciate, since your husband is declared legally dead, and the person that you're referring to goes by another name.
Please do not raise your voice.<eos> Can you imagine what would happen if this got slipped to the press?<eos> The corruption scandal that would follow your whole career?<eos> There goes any chance at a judgeship or congressional seat.<eos> Is that what you want?
We'll see you at the grand jury.<eos> We can hit you back, Ms. Winterbottom.<eos> This office has files on everyone in Ms. Keating's life.<eos> You, her students...<eos> Are you really sure you want to go down this road?
I forged a signature on the form ordering the transfer of Wesley Gibbins' body.<eos> The signature of an investigator from your office...<eos> Nate Lahey?<eos> Yes.<eos> Can you explain to the court why you would tamper with evidence this way?
I never meant to.<eos> Intent is irrelevant.<eos> Your Honor, who is trying the case here?<eos> Ms. Keating, either act as your own counsel or advise your lawyer on your own time.<eos> Ms. Atwood, did you or did you not order the cremation of Wesley Gibbins' body?
NPI 13663.<eos> Great, thank you so much.<eos> Bye-bye.<eos> Hello, it's Dr. Mathis and I was just calling to see how you're doing on the new medicine.<eos> If you're sleeping okay.
Great. Thank you so much.<eos> Terry?<eos> Dr. Mathis?<eos> Nora.<eos> I did what you told me to do.
I thought...<eos> I don't...<eos> I-I don't know how to start this.<eos> Are you looking for a psychiatrist?<eos> I was in a bad accident... severely injured, and they tell me that you're the best at this kind of thing.
But I can recommend some very qualified...<eos> Please, I don't...<eos> I don't know if...<eos> I need to start over fresh.<eos> I need to put this behind me, and if you're the best, then I...
Oh, there it goes.<eos> Offices of Jimmy Mcgill.<eos> How may I help you?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> May I put you on hold?
I was thinking of going over to Cracker Barrel Because they've got such great air-conditioning.<eos> Well, yes, I love their biscuits, too.<eos> Well, that's wonderful. Mm-hmm.<eos> Yes, I think a will is really important.<eos> When would you like to come in and meet mr. Mcgill?
I swear, fellas, I haven't seen him since here.<eos> It was a waste, so fuck him. At the Biloxi bar, man.<eos> I swear, fellas.<eos> Excuse me, miss.<eos> Were you working here two nights ago?
I can't stand to look at you.<eos> I agreed to accept the position of Interim Chief of Police to honor my son and help lead the department out of this current crisis.<eos> But I will not be accepting the job permanently, no matter who wins the election.<eos> You're just gonna walk away?<eos> I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
You know, I'm calling the police.<eos> No, you are not!<eos> What happened?<eos> He attacked me.<eos> And how many times did you hit him?
I explained to him who she was and what she'd done.<eos> And how did he respond?<eos> He defended her.<eos> She was so innocent, so pure. He didn't believe me.<eos> What did you do then?
Take your time.<eos> Thank you.<eos> He began... pushing me toward the door.<eos> And he...<eos> He picked up a pair of scissors, and... came at me again. What did you do?
- and cut his losses.<eos> - The DA will re-try.<eos> I'll make it my mission.<eos> You are a dog with a bone.<eos> And you, Mrs. Allen, are a liar and a murderer.
How did Oli do today?<eos> He had a really big breakthrough.<eos> He laughed.<eos> He did?<eos> And you can thank Brandon, he's the one that made it happen.
Police make any progress locating Edlund?<eos> No, unfortunately.<eos> But they're fairly confident that he targeted city hall because of our inability to enact the SCGR.<eos> You implying I'm somehow responsible for what happened? No.<eos> But, councilwoman, you did kill the ordinance.
Nobody respects the rights of someone to protect themselves and the people that they care for more than me, but everything in life comes with limitations.<eos> Everything.<eos> Why are you telling me this?<eos> Because you and I are gonna sit in this office until we figure out a reasonable set of limitations that respects everyone's rights.<eos> Are you hungry?
What you want... is to cage him up like an animal, like the animal who killed his father.<eos> He put an arrow in his chest.<eos> What kind of monster does that?<eos> Whatever my son is doing, he is doing it because he is hurt and he is scared, and I will not help you destroy his life.<eos> Innocent people are dying, and you might be our only chance to save them.
We insisted he be here with us.<eos> Anything you have to say to us, you can say to him.<eos> Very well.<eos> The vampire can stay.<eos> You are as generous as you are lovely.
I don't know. Five minutes, if that.<eos> Is there something wrong?<eos> I told all this to the other cop a bunch of times.<eos> Mrs. LaBelle, I know this is difficult. I'm just, I'm just doing some follow up.<eos> So, gone ten minutes and when you come back that's, that's when you see Billy in the water.
Mrs. LaBelle, I couldn't help but notice in the pictures of the scene, I didn't see anything like a blanket or a picnic basket.<eos> Picnic basket?<eos> Sorry. I don't own a picnic basket.<eos> Mrs. LaBelle, I know this is difficult.<eos> I know you've been through a lot and I'm not here to add to your pain.
Mrs. LaBelle, I know this is difficult.<eos> I know you've been through a lot and I'm not here to add to your pain.<eos> My son is dead.<eos> What do you think you can add?<eos> If you weren't with him that morning, if you were sleeping it off and he was out there on his own,
Let her do her job, Phil.<eos> Says it's been going on for months and you guys are nowhere on it.<eos> I'm afraid I can't talk about other cases.<eos> Guess everyone'll be focused on Katie Pine now.<eos> Kinda surprised you're here at all.
Wednesday.<eos> Is that important?<eos> The fire will burn for four days while Katie's spirit walks the world.<eos> Miss Pine, I'm Noelle Dyson with the Algonquin Bay Police.<eos> I'm so sorry for what you're going through.
The fire will burn for four days while Katie's spirit walks the world.<eos> Miss Pine, I'm Noelle Dyson with the Algonquin Bay Police.<eos> I'm so sorry for what you're going through.<eos> I've, um, I've come with a message from my fellow officers.<eos> I understand that you intend to give Katie a Christian service?
- I know that.<eos> - Just let him go. - I just want my family back.<eos> Allright,allright, okay,okay.<eos> If you let him go, I'll get you what you need. I will find your family, i promise you.<eos> Ma'am, look around you. You got nowhere to go.
Making some progress.<eos> Come in, Mr. rawlings.<eos> You are aware that lady bevell feels that they are hopeless.<eos> I'm the one cleaning up her mess.<eos> Dr. hess, last I heard, you and the rest of the leadership felt getting the winchesters was key to bringing the American hunters on board.
Why'd you call me here?<eos> I didn't.<eos> Mr. Davies.<eos> Dr. hess.<eos> I didn't think you left London.
He thinks he's better than us.<eos> Do you have a list of his book...<eos> Budmouth Taxis, how can I help you?<eos> Could you hold on a minute?<eos> Do you have a list of the ones he did and didn't carry out?
We'll need your computer.<eos> It'd be better if you just told us what the text was supposed to mean.<eos> I didn't send any bloody texts.<eos> - Well, someone did. - Yes, that was possibly me. Sarah, please say you didn't.<eos> - Who are you?
The desk sergeant said you asked to speak to a detective.<eos> - That's right.<eos> - Please.<eos> What is it you'd like to talk to us about?<eos> Do you have information about it?
Baudelaires!<eos> I'm so happy to see you.<eos> Are you here to continue your research?<eos> Actually, Justice Strauss, we're here to research something else.<eos> Do you have any books on the theater?
Excuse me, but why are you wearing that mask over your face?<eos> I heard there were reptiles.<eos> They... they might be contagious.<eos> Reptiles aren't contagious.<eos> Are you sure you're a qualified nurse?
Help me find a cure.<eos> Help me help you.<eos> - Nobody can help me.<eos> - It's not too late.<eos> She was awake when you cut her open.
I'm going to have to ask you to pick up the money and put it back in your bag.<eos> I will not talk with you about any of this.<eos> I cannot state, officially or unofficially, where your interests diverge, or if they diverge.<eos> On a human note, I understand the swirl that must be going on inside your head.<eos> But you have to find counsel for it elsewhere.
I've gotta get ready for work.<eos> You mind? Do what you need to do.<eos> I'm not gonna be much help, anyway.<eos> I don't know where he is.<eos> When's the last time you saw him?
Four ABZ gangsters. Kids his age.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Killed my father.<eos> He died nine months later, and then my mother, she moved back to Seoul to live with her sister.<eos> But you stayed.
It belongs to me.<eos> No, you come back here, lady.<eos> Oh, God. Oh, God, sir.<eos> I... I di... Are you okay?<eos> You hit me.
Did it not occur to you that the people who had your computer in the first place were the same ones that broke into your home?<eos> - Yeah. But...<eos> - Occam's Razor and whatnot.<eos> What?<eos> Did it not occur to you that approaching a criminal suspect without official capacity is a good way to get your wig knocked off?
What happened to your finger?<eos> Ruth, look at me.<eos> - Were you engaged in a confrontation?<eos> - No, it was an accident.<eos> Have you been able to replace your medications?
- Yeah, I'm coming in here...<eos> - You come into my workplace...<eos> - I have things to help you...<eos> - and you ask me about my job.<eos> You think just because you left your door wide open for some punk to stroll right in, that the universe now somehow revolves around you?
What, they got Manga?<eos> The Japanese comic books that no grown man should expect to read without looking like a creep?<eos> I'll wait out here.<eos> I'll be right there.<eos> Can I help you find something?
Sometimes somebody knows they're being followed, the go into a building so they can skip out back.<eos> Leaving whosever tailing them out front thumb up their ass.<eos> Come on, get in the truck. Come on!<eos> And I'm telling you I can't.<eos> I can take him back. You can stay out here.
Charles McGill's mental health isn't at issue.<eos> This is a smear job on the State Bar's upcoming witness... nothing more.<eos> This is not a competency hearing, Ms. Wexler.<eos> Mr. Hamlin is not a psychiatric professional.<eos> Do you have any questions that would be more germane to his experience?
Your brother -- he had a breakdown in court?<eos> It's in the transcripts.<eos> God.<eos> And I'm worried, I'm just -- if he screws up with one more big client... It's just gonna destroy him!<eos> Oh, don't -- don't write -- what are you writing?
We're just swinging a lens.<eos> I'll be back in two ticks.<eos> We're losing the light.<eos> Tighter.<eos> Are you sure that's not too tight?
While your marital status may present some questions, that's not why we're turning down your application.<eos> You're turning me down?<eos> Why?<eos> Because it's no longer 1940.<eos> You're simply too old.
Miss Pauline... she wrote this script.<eos> - But Bob will direct it.<eos> - No.<eos> She would also direct the picture.<eos> And you would star.
H-How did he get that?<eos> It's a birthmark.<eos> He was born with it.<eos> It's been a long time.<eos> You probably don't remember.
11:45 p.m. on 3/9.<eos> 6:15 a.m. on 3:17.<eos> If you're asking me whether I made these payments, the answer is no.<eos> I wasn't even working at these times.<eos> So, if Ms. Carlson didn't make the payments, then it must've been you.
First, we got to find him in four hours, and he could be anywhere.<eos> I want the doors flanked, front and back.<eos> If you need more bodies, let me know.<eos> You had one patient.<eos> You couldn't keep him protected.
- She's just trying to help.<eos> - Ma'am?<eos> - Miss, this guy covers tracks pretty well.<eos> He knew what he was doing.<eos> Do you have anywhere you can go for the next couple days?
Dr. Sekara.<eos> Dr. Williams.<eos> Dr. Kinney.<eos> Good morning.<eos> How are you?
- Fred Andrews.<eos> - You look like you could use this.<eos> May I try a blue cheese slider, please?<eos> Of course.<eos> Hey, you're the music teacher at the high school, right?
Can we talk?<eos> Penelope?<eos> Clifford?<eos> How are you holding up?<eos> How do you think?
Yup. I feel that.<eos> Trying to hold on to something a lot older than me, too.<eos> Just... If Betty's gonna do anything crazy, can you please let me know so I can do something to stop it?<eos> Thank you for taking the time, Ms. Grundy.<eos> Like I said, the Blue and Gold is doing a series of articles spotlighting teachers, and you're our first.
Just... If Betty's gonna do anything crazy, can you please let me know so I can do something to stop it?<eos> Thank you for taking the time, Ms. Grundy.<eos> Like I said, the Blue and Gold is doing a series of articles spotlighting teachers, and you're our first.<eos> Let's begin.<eos> Uh, you joined the faculty last year.
Uh, you joined the faculty last year.<eos> Where did you move to Riverdale from?<eos> Um, here and there.<eos> I was just mostly on the road.<eos> But you've taught at other schools, I'm assuming?
And money won't be a problem, Betty. Not now, not ever. Not with us.<eos> But, of course, we don't want to just offer financial support, we want to give Polly all the emotional support that a young mother-to-be needs.<eos> Where is Polly staying now?<eos> I'd rather not say yet.<eos> You understand.
Jack, despite his manners, is a value to me. Especially now.<eos> Don't keep Swagger waiting.<eos> You won't regret giving me a second chance, Lon.<eos> Just focus. We need to finish this.<eos> Mrs. Swagger, you're even more beautiful in person than you are on TV.
Anne, we have a formal offer of $500,000 for exclusive rights to Julie and Bob Lee's story.<eos> I know Julie's gone.<eos> Can we please come in and talk it over?<eos> I know she needs the money.<eos> You have a beautiful home.
You think you can strong-arm me, but you can't.<eos> I'll go to the press.<eos> Excuse me, Ambassador.<eos> She came to Homeland first. She was raising hell in our office.<eos> I'm truly sorry about your trouble, but I have no idea who you are.
You'll have to settle for freedom.<eos> You're the national security advisor, right?<eos> You advise the president on which foreign leaders to meet with and where.<eos> You're a smart one, aren't you?<eos> You put the president of the United States in Seattle with the Ukrainian president.
You can appeal if you like, Mr. O'Boyle, but I'm going to allow her to testify, niqab and all.<eos> I was reading in my bedroom when I thought I heard a scream.<eos> - And what happened then?<eos> - I went to my window.<eos> - And what did you see?
- Ms. Rafiq, you...<eos> You don't get a lot of sun, do you?<eos> I ask the court to admonish Mr. O'Boyle for making light of the witness's religious customs.<eos> "Making light." That's very funny, Mr. Stone.<eos> Ms. Rafiq, are you aware that almost the entire body's intake of vitamin D
- At night.<eos> Yes.<eos> But there was a streetlight.<eos> I saw everything that happened, sir.<eos> How do you know?
How do you know?<eos> Nothing further.<eos> - Redirect, Your Honor?<eos> - Go ahead.<eos> Ms. Rafiq, do you have Type 1 or Type 2 Diabetes?
Deputy Corcoran, could you please raise some fingers?<eos> Can you see how many fingers the deputy has raised?<eos> Yes.<eos> Three.<eos> And are you wearing contacts right now?
He did it so you don't have to.<eos> So you don't have to.<eos> When I selected this jury, I was being a clever lawyer.<eos> Perhaps too clever by half.<eos> I selected you, ma'am, because you went to church.
- Excuse me? Hi.<eos> Hello.<eos> I'm Jenna McNeil. I'm with the Brown Daily Herald.<eos> I have an appointment with Mr. Garcia.<eos> Are you doing an article on the Mint?
Really? 'Cause I mean, you know,<eos> Auntie Ray picked out a lot of this stuff.<eos> I mean, uh, uh, the cabinets and the tile.<eos> I mean, she had a pretty good eye.<eos> But, you know, you're the expert.
Auntie Ray picked out a lot of this stuff.<eos> I mean, uh, uh, the cabinets and the tile.<eos> I mean, she had a pretty good eye.<eos> But, you know, you're the expert.<eos> Whatever you think will help.
But, you know, you're the expert.<eos> Whatever you think will help.<eos> You know what, it's probably fine.<eos> That would just be puttin' money out in the hopes of gettin' more back, and, well...<eos> What do you think I'm gonna get for it?
Okay, I've requisitioned some K-rails.<eos> We should have crews ready to go as early as EOW.<eos> I tell you, I am very happy to have an emergency manager here in Blackburg.<eos> It is the best thing that could have happened.<eos> And what do you have to say about the fact that there's a Farrell in custody as a suspect in Breece Dobbs' shooting?
They pull people over for things like that?<eos> Well, it's blocking your license plate.<eos> You must've been in a hurry. No, I...<eos> I always do dumb stuff like that.<eos> Where you headed?
Hello, norman.<eos> Pretty night, isn't it?<eos> Yes. Yes, sheriff.<eos> Isn't it just?<eos> So, w-what can I help you with tonight?
I wondered if I might have a look at it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, of... of course.<eos> I was just closing up, but come on in.<eos> So who are you looking for?
Well, would $60 be okay?<eos> It's our special, off-season, stormy, "Middle of the night" rate.<eos> Thank you. That's very sweet of you.<eos> Well, we all need a "Middle of the night" rate sometimes.<eos> So where are you joining us from, Miss Samuels?
Sorry, I'm starving.<eos> My aunt used to tell me ladies eat like birds.<eos> Good thing I'm not a bird.<eos> No.<eos> You're not a bird.
My aunt used to tell me ladies eat like birds.<eos> Good thing I'm not a bird.<eos> No.<eos> You're not a bird.<eos> And I'm glad you're enjoying it.
I'm just getting a little worried because he wouldn't answer his cell phone.<eos> And I want to go check on him to make sure he's okay, but I don't know his actual address.<eos> So I was wondering if you could give it to me from the registry?<eos> It's not in the registry.<eos> I think maybe you should just go and try calling him again.
I know his wife.<eos> He doesn't have a wife.<eos> Look, I'm sorry. I...<eos> I really am.<eos> His... his wife is a nice woman, and... and you seem like a nice woman too.
You never requested a lawyer, Norman.<eos> In fact, you said you didn't want one.<eos> - Do you remember that?<eos> - Of course I remember that.<eos> You just wouldn't let me take my meds, so I was not able to think clearly.
Nasty. Nasty, nasty man.<eos> When Madeleine found out what was happening, she... showed up enraged.<eos> And let me tell you, it was quite the scene, Sheriff.<eos> The mistress, she took off.<eos> Those tire marks that you saw in the gravel... they were from her.
We're taking care of him.<eos> But I'm not here about your brother.<eos> We pulled two bodies out of Falls Lake a couple days ago.<eos> We just identified one of them as Audrey Ellis.<eos> Are you sure?
Okay.<eos> Are you going to the hearing?<eos> Not if you don't want me to.<eos> I can't tell you what to do about your family.<eos> How will you want to be handling your mother's remains?
We have a suspect.<eos> Now, I just need your cooperation.<eos> Give me her name, and we'll let you slide with work duty and probation.<eos> Really? Wow.<eos> You... you would do that for me?
Hello. Aunty, you sit and I'll be...<eos> - No-no...sit.<eos> Hello.<eos> Hello.<eos> Can you go to that side?
- If there was nothing else...<eos> - Are you saved, Constable?<eos> More squandered, I'm afraid.<eos> We've a uniform officer outside.<eos> Should help you to sleep safely, without any further worries.
- What, you think...? - You think they were meant for Mummy?<eos> - It's possible, miss.<eos> There was a disturbance at the Almanac programme last night. A man called Dudley Jessop.<eos> He's a degenerate.<eos> You tried to have him prosecuted for blasphemy, is that right?
- Shouldn't have been fatal, though.<eos> - Not ordinarily, no.<eos> Certainly not to anyone in decent health.<eos> I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.<eos> - You shouldn't be here.
I can show you, if you like.<eos> So you said you've been with the group a couple of months. That right?<eos> - Band. Nick prefers "band" to "group".<eos> - Does he?<eos> How was it you came to be with them?
Pippa and me went backstage after a concert they did and got talking to them, and just... stayed on, I suppose.<eos> - Do you like it?<eos> - Oh, it's a scene.<eos> - Shall I tell you something?<eos> - If you like.
You've a nerve!<eos> What's he doing here?<eos> Detective Constable Morse is here on other business, Mrs Pettybon.<eos> I told the Chief Constable I don't want him.<eos> Perhaps you didn't hear. I'm here about another matter.
YEMKTTHL 4099.<eos> - That's... It's just a matrix number.<eos> - "Yet each man kills the thing he loves."<eos> 4099. The prisoner number assigned to Oscar Wilde when he was sent to Reading Gaol.<eos> I think you couldn't stand that Nick was sleeping with Barry Finch.
He couldn't be sure that his sex game hadn't gone wrong.<eos> What sex game?<eos> In Justine, de Sade's book, one character has another hang him to the point of unconsciousness.<eos> I think Nick experimented with the same idea.<eos> The thing is, all you had to do that night was wait.
In Justine, de Sade's book, one character has another hang him to the point of unconsciousness.<eos> I think Nick experimented with the same idea.<eos> The thing is, all you had to do that night was wait.<eos> What?<eos> By the time you strangled Barry Finch, he was already dying.
That's not about you.<eos> - It is! He told me!<eos> No, it's not.<eos> "Go back to the old school. Look under the toadstool."<eos> The lyrics don't apply to you.
Unlike your sisters, I won't indulge you.<eos> Bonbons.<eos> Now.<eos> We don't appear to have your full notes.<eos> Where were you before?
Now, let's have a listen to baby's heartbeat.<eos> Then blood pressure, urine sample, and we'll book you in for a home visit.<eos> Oh, I shan't be at home.<eos> I'm to go to St Cuthbert's for my caesarean.<eos> We'll want to see you regularly now, and, well, it'll save you the journey.
I'm a trifle deaf these days.<eos> Midwife calling.<eos> Mrs Reed. How are we today?<eos> Oh, you know, still breathless, and I feel ever so big now.<eos> I'll make us coffee, and while I do, I'd like you to look through these.
Oh, you know, still breathless, and I feel ever so big now.<eos> I'll make us coffee, and while I do, I'd like you to look through these.<eos> A little light reading. We recommend it for all our mothers-to-be.<eos> But... Nurse Mount, you made it sound as if I shouldn't hope.<eos> We can offer no promises, nothing to outweigh those with greater knowledge, but at this moment, you are an expectant mother.
The paediatrician took it straight away.<eos> Sir?<eos> Do excuse me, I'm Nurse Mount, Mrs Reed's district midwife.<eos> I ask that I be allowed to break the news to Mrs Reed.<eos> Mrs Reed... you have a daughter.
'Their love and our endurance make us human and complete.'<eos> Welcome home, Nurse Franklin.<eos> I'm afraid I need you to man the phone.<eos> Me and the baby, stuck in here for 30 days, with me mother-in-law looking after us.<eos> You don't sound terribly keen.
I've got out of the habit of it myself.<eos> I never seem to have time for all the little things that make you look respectable.<eos> You look perfectly respectable to me.<eos> Good morning, Mrs Turner.<eos> I'm just going to ease you over into this chair so that we can tidy up, ready for Mr Kenley's rounds.
Until Sister Mary Cynthia is well enough to choose to make contact with us herself, we must treat her with the respect we would show to anyone else who isn't well.<eos> Especially if the illness is a mental one.<eos> Mrs Wallace?<eos> I've sorted everything out.<eos> I'd be pleased... if you weren't crying as you said that.
What's happening?<eos> I'm putting this Nil-By-Mouth sign over your bed, Mrs Venables, because in the morning you're going to be having an operation.<eos> Are they going to put that stitch in?<eos> Mr Kenley has decided you're a prime candidate for cervical cerclage.<eos> Nurse Busby will pop by in a few minutes to help you to prepare.
Of course I can.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Now, can you open your mouth as wide as you can bear?<eos> That's perfect.<eos> Very good. All done. You can close your mouth now.
I'm afraid your teeth are going to have to come out.<eos> How many?<eos> Given the extent of your gum disease, I think all of them.<eos> All of them?<eos> And, bearing in mind how poorly you've been feeling, the sooner the better.
How many?<eos> Given the extent of your gum disease, I think all of them.<eos> All of them?<eos> And, bearing in mind how poorly you've been feeling, the sooner the better.<eos> I'm going to put you to sleep and while you're dreaming of lovely things, I will deal with everything.
How could you let her go when you could've died from what they did to you?<eos> ! You're going to live with the damage for the rest of your life.<eos> Do you really want the same for Deka?<eos> Do you really want some man to pin her down and cut and sew her closed?<eos> Is that what you want, Mrs Farah?
I will get this figured out.<eos> And to answer your question... no, I didn't do it.<eos> I didn't ask you that.<eos> Yes. You did.<eos> What are you doing back here, ma'am?
Where's the family?<eos> I'll take you.<eos> Um, Jun Park.<eos> CRT.<eos> We're glad you're here.
Thank you for coming out here.<eos> Getting in and out of this car is an ordeal, so...<eos> Yeah. I'm sure it is.<eos> No need to explain.<eos> You've gone through quite a lot.
Well, I could pass that along to her, if you like.<eos> Could you give me her number?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I can't.<eos> But if you like, I can give her a way to reach you.
Oh. I'm sorry.<eos> I just got to do this by myself.<eos> Well, hello.<eos> Sorry to interrupt.<eos> I just wanted you to know that I was here just in case you'd like to talk.
911.<eos> What's your emergency?<eos> Hey, I want to check on the status of a patient.<eos> His name's Clayton Carter.<eos> Are you a spouse or family member?
Any word about Rayna's condition.<eos> - Juliette, was Rayna James assaulted? - Can you tell us anything...<eos> Looking for Room 208.<eos> They said it was at the end of the hall.<eos> I can't let you go in there right now.
No, no, I don't have time to talk to anybody else.<eos> - Can't you fix this?<eos> - This isn't a neurological problem.<eos> I have a show tomorrow night.<eos> Well, what you're describing, the... sensory disturbances, out of body experience, are the signs of a dissociative state.
Yes. What is it?<eos> [clears throat] Um... I don't understand why Gracie can't continue her studies with Hudson up in the Green Zone.<eos> The change of scenery's been very distracting.<eos> - I'm fighting with my sister. - Oh.<eos> Have you tried listening to Sister Maddie's perspective?
My ex-husband is completely innocent.<eos> I have to go to lunch.<eos> Well, we're not done here.<eos> Well, I would say we are.<eos> You know, Martin should go to lunch, and as you promised, Mrs., um...
Ms. Leon, when you say "she should have her daughter back,"<eos> you mean you would be all right with unsupervised visits?<eos> No, shared custody, Mr. Gutteman.<eos> I'm talking about shared custody.<eos> Ms. Leon, I think you're confused.
Are you sure I can't help you find something?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Will this be all?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Are you, John's mother?
To be honest, I had never heard of it. But my office assured me it was legitimate. Unfortunately...<eos> My business is quite legitimate, Ms. Whelan... as am I.<eos> Yet you're here with $300 million to be a part of a... a team? My team?<eos> My team doesn't exist.<eos> Not yet, at least, but the funding does... All set up in a PAC account, controlled by you and you alone.
- Peus. And Ms...?<eos> - Ruland.<eos> I've had the privilege of serving at the pleasure of the president for...<eos> For far too long.<eos> How sick and tired must you be?
How sick and tired must you be?<eos> Of serving someone else, of catering to that big old man-baby's every waking need, of working day in, day out in service of someone else's vision?<eos> The slog, right?<eos> Come on. Be honest.<eos> How jazzed are you gonna be come January, when your official duties are dunzo, huh?
Come January, my duties to the president will continue, Ms. Ruland.<eos> Now, that's just sad.<eos> What I think Marjorie is trying to say is, you don't have to do that. At least, you shouldn't.<eos> You have ideas, Ms. Whelan.<eos> You have a vision, a point of view that is entirely your own.
What about as president?<eos> You can't be serious.<eos> You're serious.<eos> I'm not a politician.<eos> You are not a politician. You've never run for anything in your life. You don't fit here.
You can't be serious.<eos> You're serious.<eos> I'm not a politician.<eos> You are not a politician. You've never run for anything in your life. You don't fit here.<eos> You're cut from an entirely different cloth. You even fail to recognize your own value.
I can't just leave.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - Because I'm his right hand.<eos> You think the president isn't gonna notice if I leave?<eos> You're a smart girl. You'll figure it out.
I'm going to war for you.<eos> What does that... What does that mean, Red?<eos> All you need to know is I'm not giving up.<eos> I'm here to make a deal.<eos> You're not in the strongest deal-making position right now, Ms. Whelan.
I'll give it to you, and I assure you it will be worth it.<eos> I just need you to get Cyrus out of jail.<eos> What is it?<eos> Will you get Cyrus out of jail?<eos> If the information is as good as you say it is, you have a deal.
Our first... female president.<eos> You'll beat Sally Langston in this race.<eos> She thinks she's the only one who gets to make history?<eos> We'll show 'em.<eos> You'll show 'em, won't you, Madame President?
You will sell it.<eos> Because you saved earth from Eros.<eos> We all know who really did that.<eos> And whom do I serve?<eos> Why didn't you ever run for office?
Why didn't you ever run for office?<eos> I like getting shit done.<eos> And I like to keep my head attached to my neck.<eos> You father was smart.<eos> You're smarter.
Those fuckers who did Eros sure as hell picked a side.<eos> So, great.<eos> Everything is as it should be then.<eos> If Eros rammed into earth wiped out half of your people, then you'd know.<eos> - How're you feeling?
- Thank you for coming by, sir.<eos> Sergeant draper.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Mcrn command is going to need your cooperation with the investigation on ganymede.<eos> But you can speak off the record with me, if you want.
There was no drone over your position.<eos> No, no.<eos> That's not right.<eos> I saw it. - You think I am making it up.<eos> - No. No. I believe you saw something.
It's hard to feel we matter out here, isn't it?<eos> The distances are so vast.<eos> It's hard to believe that we can make a difference.<eos> Sergeant draper.<eos> In recognition of your extraordinary service to Mars, mcrn command has awarded you the purple heart.
Apparently the Count has already checked out of the Dorchester and the Savoy.<eos> As long as nobody interferes with my job, I'm sure he'll have a long and happy stay with us.<eos> Your Excellency.<eos> Lady Hamilton...<eos> You are even more radiant than your reputation led me to believe.
You grew up so fast. Both of you.<eos> Lady Hamilton.<eos> - May I?<eos> - Of course.<eos> You don't remember me, do you?
Sent to his wife and daughter, to where they're hiding in France.<eos> Each letter has been returned, undelivered, unopened.<eos> Well, there's a simple answer to that, then.<eos> You can't do that.<eos> Well, you shouldn't do that, but yeah, you can.
Only one person I care about.<eos> Yourself?<eos> Well, actually, I was referring to Mr. Jim Beam, but that's a good answer, too.<eos> Look, I'm making a point.<eos> You're an assistant manager in a hotel.
I'm on room service.<eos> Lucky me!<eos> Hello, again. Mr. O'Hara.<eos> I trust you're enjoying your stay?<eos> So will you be coming to my party tomorrow, then?
Feeling better now?<eos> He lied to you as well, then, didn't he?<eos> Over and over...<eos> Miss. Lambert.<eos> You are not welcome here.
Yes, and a madam knows how to run a brothel.<eos> I'm not sure it's something to be proud of.<eos> You have houses in the country.<eos> Staff, costs, overheads.<eos> This place is the only thing that brings you revenue.
- Very well, thank you.<eos> - Pleased to hear it.<eos> There was one question I had.<eos> Please, I'm an open book.<eos> When you've punished me and when you've ruined this place, when you've done all that, do you think somehow it will alleviate this pain you feel?
Well, just remember I tried to warn you. I did that much at least.<eos> Well, what will they do with me?<eos> You know they're looking to intern Mosley and many others for treason.<eos> No, I can't go to jail!<eos> What did you expect?
Wasting away in the country.<eos> Well, that's not going to happen so, please...<eos> What are you waiting for?<eos> For me to show you the bloody door?<eos> I know what you're going through.
Your room's been covered by your employer, so all that's left is to collate your bar bill.<eos> I'll have someone bring it up to your room.<eos> That's it?<eos> Was there something else?<eos> Just you don't seem surprised.
We can't keep secrets from each other, Peggy.<eos> That's what the Germans want.<eos> What secrets might they be, Mrs. Hobbs?<eos> Nothing, sir.<eos> I do hope so. Because if I thought you were spreading malicious gossip about the staff, or, indeed, the Hamilton family, you would be out of that door, before you knew what was happening.
So, it looks like Delane is shutting down foreign reporting.<eos> You must be very hard to replace, Mr. O'Hara.<eos> Well, this new show they're lining up, it's gonna be big.<eos> An assistant's position maybe?<eos> Be a chance for you to see the world.
It's all right for you. Places like this.<eos> - You wouldn't understand.<eos> - Believe me...<eos> I understand.<eos> Betsey offers you anything, you say no.
- Mr. Fowkkes, you've made your point.<eos> Ms. Benitez, I denied Mr. Fowwkes' motion to suppress Bosch's account of his conversation with Mr. Holland and his putative confession, did I not?<eos> Yes, Your Honor, and correctly so.<eos> What I did not do is immunize Detective Bosch from cross-examination.<eos> And if you're unhappy with my decision, you can always revisit a plea agreement with Mr. Fowkkes before the jury is seated.
You know all these cruisers have stereos, right?<eos> We should have some detecting music.<eos> - Detecting music?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You had your little detective moment back there, and now we're gonna go and talk to a bad guy, so, do you who Dime Store Darlings are?
Sit down.<eos> "If there is no struggle, there is no progress."<eos> That's his most popular quote.<eos> There's not many people left who understand Frederick Douglass' significance to history.<eos> So, uh, what did, you, um...?
I believe it would.<eos> Honey, do you think that's a good idea?<eos> No. I think it's a great idea.<eos> Oh, come on, Pats.<eos> Do you have a daughter in there?
I like to come here for inspiration.<eos> I especially get inspired standing right here.<eos> - Is this the Merriwick?<eos> - Named after Cassie's ancestors.<eos> I didn't know you and the plant were connected.
It's gonna be any day now.<eos> That flower is looking more ready to open than a jar of jam on Sunday morning.<eos> It's hard to tell.<eos> I've been doing readings, and checking the pH balance, but...<eos> You can check anything you want. I'm just telling you what I know.
They cannot be trusted to do what's right.<eos> Okay, let's take a seat and read chapter five, all right?<eos> - Mrs. Bowman.<eos> - Hi, Lindsey.<eos> Did you come for the service?
I completely overreacted to the situation.<eos> I know you were just trying to do what's best for the children.<eos> And...<eos> Gracie misses you, and we'd love for you to come back to the house.<eos> I've actually been expecting you.
Travis did die for Mars.<eos> And if that story stops a war that we do not want, then he died a hero.<eos> You did well in there, Gunny.<eos> The hard part's over. You can relax now.<eos> You'll be going home soon.
An entire nation dedicated to a common goal.<eos> To turn a lifeless rock into a garden.<eos> A dear friend told me that.<eos> He wanted to retire to Mars. But he died.<eos> Did you know that the majority of people on Earth don't have jobs?
Yes, ma'am.<eos> It's not that they're lazy, you know.<eos> It's just that we can't give them enough opportunities.<eos> In this building it's easy to forget...<eos> With all due respect, madam, where are you going with this?
For being from Earth.<eos> Yes.<eos> Was he a good soldier?<eos> One of my best.<eos> Do you really believe that after all that sacrifice, and all his training, the training that made him, as you said, one of your best soldiers, do you believe, after all that hard work,
- Has somebody been hurt?<eos> - Not in this instance, no.<eos> - He even tried it on with me.<eos> - Dr Powell did?<eos> - You weren't interested?
Her husband was the first.<eos> Only she wouldn't leave it alone.<eos> You see, it was... it was too early.<eos> I needed more people to lay at Powell's door, otherwise they could have brushed it under the carpet, as with Molly.<eos> So you... So you wrote the letter... .. pretending to be from the hospital.
Okay, we're not gonna lie. Would've been good to know.<eos> He was not a good man, Abby.<eos> He didn't listen to my words.<eos> - [belches] Stay down, Gary.<eos> - But you only ate some of him?
- I told you, my friend threw it up.<eos> Mr. Wichita, I'd like you to come with me to the fifth floor.<eos> Why? What's going on up there?<eos> Until we figure out what this is and who it came from, I think it'd be best for you to stay with us.<eos> - You're not a virologist, are you?
You know them?<eos> I don't manage the property on a day-to-day basis.<eos> I inherited it from my grandfather.<eos> I can't tell you much about them, except that they keep the place running. It's not what it once was.<eos> Well, have you ever had any problems there?
I can't deal with this anymore.<eos> You.<eos> You did this. Excuse me?<eos> I haven't done you did it with the champagne last night.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.
- Okay, here we go.<eos> Let's get you inside.<eos> And they could never run faster than us.<eos> There you go.<eos> Nurse Barton will be in to help you get in bed, okay?
It's not normally toxic to humans, but with this amount, who knows?<eos> I suppose if any place was gonna have a giant assassin bug, it'd be Portland.<eos> No way.<eos> - Hi, Mrs. Stanton.<eos> - How have you been?
No way.<eos> - Hi, Mrs. Stanton.<eos> - How have you been?<eos> Oh, you know, okay.<eos> I guess the melatonin's helping you sleep?
- He left.<eos> Mrs. Stanton.<eos> Why did you bring all these people?<eos> - We're here to help.<eos> - Are you hurt?
So if we're alive in this world, does that mean that... In the other place, they're not?<eos> Not necessarily.<eos> What we consider death in our world is something very different somewhere else.<eos> Possibly, a pre-life or an afterlife.<eos> Are you talking heaven-ish, or... Hell-ish?
Are you quite sure he did that?<eos> I don't... Beggin' your pardon, ma'am.<eos> I was there with my ole father when Mr Francis made the promise.<eos> And so we ask your kind help, ma'am.<eos> For in the saving of this house, you'll be doing God's handiwork.
Come in.<eos> Captain Poldark.<eos> Miss Chynoweth.<eos> It appears my visits here must cease.<eos> Can I rely on you to see my aunt is cared for?
Yet the event often proves the worth of the man.<eos> Cometh the hour?<eos> Are you suggesting that this persecution is the work of our servants?<eos> I'm sorry to say so, ma'am.<eos> And I know it must be unbeknown to you. To me?
And she insists she has no time to talk about the theft.<eos> Well, we'll see about that.<eos> It's like I said,<eos> I have two hours of film to cut before an 11:00 a.m. mix, and I'm already behind.<eos> What exactly do you do, Ms. Coyle?
- Oh, no, no.<eos> You go, Meg.<eos> I'll take care of Mrs. Samuels.<eos> My husband's doing that. He's throwing up.<eos> - Oh, poor thing, you must be so worried.
Anything.<eos> But there's something you have to do first.<eos> - Mr. Ross. - Miss Price.<eos> I wanted to talk to you.<eos> Do you have a minute?
Debug my processor?<eos> Reboot my motherboard?<eos> - Please, I just need to update your vox in peace.<eos> - If I wanted my vox updated, I'd be talking to someone with a lot more experience than you.<eos> - Ms. paulsen, i know you know this but I will remind you for the 37th time-- that vox is our computer's operating system, and it needs to be updated once a quarter.
- reckless endangerment?<eos> Is this a joke?<eos> - I guarantee you, Sofia price isn't laughing.<eos> - Well, any judge in his right mind is gonna laugh you out of court, because you don't understand the law.<eos> - No, you're the one that doesn't understand the law,
I want you to go over every goddamn molecule on that armor and tell me if there's anything you've missed.<eos> Do you understand me?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Right away, sir.<eos> Do you have any idea where Dr. Strickland might have been going?
Do you promise that the testimony you shall give in the case before this court shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> I do.<eos> DDA Hobbs?<eos> Thank you, Your Honor.<eos> Detective Sykes, you were one of the investigators working the crime scene of this murder, is that right?
Thank you, Your Honor.<eos> Good morning, Detective.<eos> Since my client, Mr. Bloom, had an alibi for the night of the murder, placing him a ferry boat ride away at the time of death on Catalina Island with his son, did you consider other suspects like, say, the victim's wife, Brooke?<eos> We looked at Mrs. Chandler, yes, but she also had an out-of-town alibi.<eos> When did you leave for Santa Barbara?
Okay.<eos> How did your husband get along with his co-workers at Wescott?<eos> Like Lisa Kirk, the woman he had dinner with before he was murdered.<eos> I've never heard of her.<eos> You don't know the name of your husband's supervisor?
No one ever sees it again, that's right.<eos> But...<eos> Winnie Davis is watching you<eos> - as closely as she is me. - ‭Mm-hmm.<eos> And I can't afford for the more classified element of this case to throw you off track.
So now would be a terrible time for Major Crimes to get lost chasing dead ends like Wescott.<eos> Hence the laptop.<eos> And a little prayer that if one of us moves up, the other doesn't need to move out.<eos> Commander, are you offering me a deal?<eos> Well, I know you love 'em.
Just minute!<eos> How can I help you? Whoa.<eos> There's many of you.<eos> Ma'am, we can smell vast quantities of marijuana. Coming from your house.<eos> Are you a registered dispensary?
With the purchase of one of my photos, You get free baggie of medicine.<eos> I'm calling them pot shots.<eos> Is cute!<eos> Marketing.<eos> Ma'am, I'm not asking you where that pot came from.
This gift fell from the sky, saying, "take me.<eos> Use me."<eos> So I dragged the pot to my car.<eos> Was very heavy.<eos> You didn't happen to hear a scream, Or the sound of a body crashing against a tree? No.
Crossfire! Crossfire!<eos> Excuse me for interrupting, captain.<eos> I heard you made an arrest.<eos> Yes. Chief, please come in.<eos> I'm glad you're here.
- Oh. - So, you know, if you're free...<eos> Well, I'll tell you what, I'll drop you back at the station, you can do a routine enquiry with social services.<eos> Yeah. It's better to be safe than sorry.<eos> We managed to locate Nathan's mam, a Diane Weaver.<eos> Ah, you could have left her address at the centre, saved yourself a trip.
She's beautiful.<eos> She was... the best thing that's happened to this family, and I intend to get her justice.<eos> And that's why we're here.<eos> You said "They're killing our daughters."<eos> What do you mean by that?
Listen to me. You can't blame yourself.<eos> Okay?<eos> We're gonna find this guy because of you.<eos> You hear me?<eos> Ms. Barnes, do you know where your husband might be right now?
Maxine Carlson for Eric Beaumont.<eos> I don't see your name here, Ms. Carlson.<eos> What time was your appointment?<eos> That's odd.<eos> Are you sure?
Time to tell him.<eos> Mr. Beaumont?<eos> There's something I should have said up front.<eos> The reason Oliver rejected my application is because...<eos> I know who you are, Ms. Carlson.
The transplant committee's gonna want another assessment.<eos> If you'll excuse me, I've got to get to the mm. Yes. Thank you for telling me.<eos> Of course.<eos> The patient became unstable due to an unrecognized pericardial effusion, which was stabilized by emergent pericardiocentesis.<eos> You presented the images of the mrcp demonstrating cholelithiasis to support your diagnosis of pancreatitis due to choledocholithiasis, but you aren't showing us any images of the lung bases or heart.
In hindsight, yes.<eos> At the time, I believed I had what I needed.<eos> Let's move on.<eos> You mentioned placing the patient on bipap, which exacerbated cardiac tamponade.<eos> How did you respond?
That's the thing about the e.D.<eos> Another story's just a heartbeat away.<eos> Can you say that again on camera?<eos> Yes, that'll be better.<eos> Ms. Goodwin, if you have a second...
There's nothing we could have done;<eos> It was a bad, bad break.<eos> I don't see how we can use any of the footage we shot.<eos> I disagree.<eos> We couldn't have gotten a better endorsement for you, Or the hospital.
I hear you had some trouble today.<eos> I fell down.<eos> Big deal.<eos> Well, says here your troponin level is .08.<eos> That means you fell down because you were having a small heart attack.
That's it... why not?<eos> You're the same person you used to be.<eos> Am I?<eos> You just said there's a bug in my head pulling the strings.<eos> But now that you know, you can do something about it... make better decisions.
You are so brave, and I am so proud of you.<eos> And I love you.<eos> So, so much.<eos> Ms. Holloway.<eos> - Where you going?
Exactly.<eos> Whereas with Dr. Manning's patient, as the pressure in his thighs builds, the bleeding will eventually slow.<eos> Worst case, Josh loses a leg, but there is no question he has the best chance of survival.<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> - We're very sorry, but it's up to you to decide which of the boys gets the blood.
Wait. Wait!<eos> Are you giving up?<eos> No. But Ms. Goodwin is right.<eos> We can try peritoneal lavage to speed things up.<eos> You are his doctor.
- Okay.<eos> - Gotta go.<eos> - Why is that?<eos> - Miss my bus.<eos> Where are you going?
- No.<eos> Inhumans are more likely the victims of hate crimes, which is not fair.<eos> They are our friends, they are our co-workers... our brothers.<eos> They all deserve help, wherever they may be. [Camera shutter clicks]<eos> Agent Johnson, let's discuss your theft of more than $7 million from three banks while you were undercover from S.H.I.E.L.D.
Security officers approaching the location.<eos> Okay, they're moving past.<eos> We're good.<eos> - I was working as a S.H.I.E.L.D. operative ...<eos> - Without signing the Accords, so either you committed an illegal act by robbing banks or S.H.I.E.L.D. committed an illegal act by using an unauthorized enhanced agent.
Please, Mrs. Waterford. Please. Please!<eos> What is wrong with you?<eos> What is wrong with you?<eos> How can you do this?<eos> You're deranged.
- I know you don't.<eos> In fact, since we're being honest, I know exactly what kind of candidate you're looking for.<eos> - What kind is that?<eos> - One that can be manipulated into selling their employer's products.<eos> - Who are you?
- What kind is that?<eos> - One that can be manipulated into selling their employer's products.<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - It doesn't matter who I am.<eos> What matters is I know what you do.
- One that can be manipulated into selling their employer's products.<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - It doesn't matter who I am.<eos> What matters is I know what you do.<eos> - You don't know anything about me.
- Who are you?<eos> - It doesn't matter who I am.<eos> What matters is I know what you do.<eos> - You don't know anything about me.<eos> - I know that you're officially a headhunter, but unofficially, you meet your exclusively male clients at places like this.
Because one of two things is going to happen.<eos> Either I'm going to hire someone to tell every one of your male clients when they meet them that you're going to rob them, and then your cushy job making a million dollars per sucker<eos> - is going away...<eos> - or?<eos> - Or you're gonna tell me about every time you've done this for James Palmer, and you're never gonna hear from either one of us again.
My job requires a reputation for discretion.<eos> - You're gonna do what we want, or you're gonna find out how much your reputation protects you in prison.<eos> Trust me, he'll never tell a soul and your business will stay intact.<eos> - How can you be sure?<eos> - The same way I'm sure that you don't have a choice.
- You're gonna do what we want, or you're gonna find out how much your reputation protects you in prison.<eos> Trust me, he'll never tell a soul and your business will stay intact.<eos> - How can you be sure?<eos> - The same way I'm sure that you don't have a choice.<eos> The question is, are you gonna go against him or are you gonna go against me?
While I don't doubt your sincerity, Mr. Rowe, just because he was able to fool you doesn't mean he's going to be able to fool this board.<eos> It's Dr. Rowe.<eos> And I'm glad you were the one who responded to my statement.<eos> - And why is that?<eos> - Because you tried to paint a false picture of his release, and I'm here to set the record straight.
It's true Mr. Ross entered into an early release agreement.<eos> But it's also true that he stayed in longer than he had to to keep his cellmate safe.<eos> And while he was there, he risked his own life to prevent a violent man from falsely obtaining parole.<eos> And for all we know, he did that for self-serving reasons.<eos> And for all I know, that's what you're doing right now.
And in my experience, self-serving men do not risk their lives to help people.<eos> I don't call defrauding your fellow man helping people. And I certainly don't call it having integrity.<eos> With all due respect, ma'am,<eos> I'm done wasting my breath on you because the purpose of this hearing was to determine if Mike Ross had reformed.<eos> But you don't seem to be interested in that because you've already made your mind up.
No, they won't. But I think you know someone who can get it for us without issuing any subpoena at all.<eos> Ms. cromwell, remember me?<eos> Yes, unfortunately.<eos> If you'll excuse me.<eos> We have a job we'd like to offer you.
And they could use her to get to you.<eos> Your daughter's ransom is now 5 million blackcoin, Mrs. Krauss.<eos> Could you turn that off, please?<eos> You have 20 minutes.<eos> If you don't pay, Inazagi will.
It was invaluable.<eos> Mexican chocolates, from my home town.<eos> Thank you, for helping me understand your world a bit.<eos> Under His eye.<eos> But you don't understand.
There hasn't been a child born alive in Xipica in six years.<eos> My country is dying.<eos> My country's already dead.<eos> Ambassador.<eos> There you are.
Shall we?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I thought the Commander came home hungry.<eos> He's in his office.<eos> Can I help you with anything?
Glad as I am to be seen, how do you know?<eos> One... I have never come across a more meticulous written accounting of a lawyer's conversations and interactions than yours.<eos> I... don't know how you find the time.<eos> Not much of a social life.<eos> And two... you were the only person in this office who noticed and removed a compromised employee.
I... don't know how you find the time.<eos> Not much of a social life.<eos> And two... you were the only person in this office who noticed and removed a compromised employee.<eos> You sat on the honor committee at Princeton.<eos> You are not in this to get caught up in some scandal.
- Addict?<eos> - Former, by the looks of it.<eos> I'll start with Drug Dependency Unit. See if they know her.<eos> - How was she killed?<eos> WPC Tennison, you're testing my patience today.
These are her white socks, and boots.<eos> We did find some red carpet fibre on the soles of her socks.<eos> And also some on the inside of her boots.<eos> DS Lawrence, I presume you're doing exhibits and photographs.<eos> For the paperwork, you are?
The amount of overlapping injuries suggest whoever inflicted them was in a rage.<eos> WPC Tennison, would you mind crouching down?<eos> Side on, foetal position, facing me.<eos> Raise your right hand.<eos> Palm upwards, as if you were trying to protect your head.
Perfect.<eos> She was struck repeatedly on the lower arm.<eos> And then beaten repeatedly on the buttocks and the back.<eos> She fell and lay prostrate on the floor.<eos> He didn't mean for you to actually do that bit, Tennison.
You've put my grandson in hospital.<eos> - Can I help, madam?<eos> - Eddie Phillips.<eos> He ain't got nothing to do with that tart's murder.<eos> - He told you that, did he?
You told me to leave it there, sir.<eos> Yes, but it needs to be in an envelope with my name on it.<eos> It's sensitive material.<eos> This vehicle was parked at Homerton Hospital.<eos> - 'Are you still there?
- Me?<eos> - Yeah, you're good with her.<eos> Between you and me, Bradfield wants to recommend you for a TDC post.<eos> You don't clear up six burglaries in one day without flashing on someone's radar.<eos> Mrs Collins, where were you on the evening of Sunday 13th May?
Don't know why you've stuck with him all these years.<eos> He's your father.<eos> He'd better not mess you about again.<eos> Come up when you're ready.<eos> Do you recognise this?
- Could it be Teresa O'Duncie?<eos> She already has connections to the case, more specifically to drugs and users.<eos> Might be worth speaking to her.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Do you abbreviate your name, Miss O'Duncie?
Let's go.<eos> Do you abbreviate your name, Miss O'Duncie?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> T-O-D.<eos> Is that you?
Do you abbreviate your name, Miss O'Duncie?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> T-O-D.<eos> Is that you?<eos> Do you recognise this number?
What do you mean?<eos> T-O-D.<eos> Is that you?<eos> Do you recognise this number?<eos> That number is for a phone box on the King Charles Road in Hackney, right around the corner from where you work.
WPC Tennison, can you think of anything we could charge her with?<eos> Conspiracy to pervert the course of justice in a murder investigation.<eos> Spot-on!<eos> And that carries a life sentence.<eos> What were you doing with Eddie and Julie-Ann?
I don't want you to leave.<eos> It's the last thing that I want.<eos> What if TOD isn't a name, but initials?<eos> The receptionist from the hospital, could it be Teresa O'Duncie?<eos> - T-O-D, is that you?
- Flowers.<eos> She only has one name.<eos> We're going to need your full name.<eos> Miss Flowers, we are speaking to Terrence O'Duncie in connection with two murders.<eos> You were not there when Mr O'Duncie attacked my officer.
- What's the hurry?<eos> Can't you finish earlier and just take longer?<eos> - Not really.<eos> - Who are you?<eos> Was it you who called the police?
Come on!<eos> - Excuse me, madam.<eos> Can you stop that?<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> I'm gonna need you to stop that. I'm a police officer, and I'm gonna need you to stop that.
Like you said, I need to keep busy.<eos> It's his wife and kids.<eos> Paul, can I borrow you?<eos> I need you to check something for me.<eos> Do you know how many wives and girlfriends we've had sat across from us, insisting they were completely in the dark?
Do you know how many wives and girlfriends we've had sat across from us, insisting they were completely in the dark?<eos> You're in this up to your neck.<eos> We're watching all the ports, so they have nowhere to go.<eos> I don't know where they are.<eos> That's bollocks, and you know it.
- Tennison, we've got this.<eos> No.<eos> Go on.<eos> If you want to help David, you need to tell us where he is.<eos> Did David tell you about Julie-Ann?
The list of Bentley associates and their last-known addresses.<eos> - You sent cars out?<eos> - Sergeant Harris thought you'd coordinate.<eos> WPC Tennison...<eos> What does that look like to you?
- Quite sure.<eos> Sorry to... bother you.<eos> My name's DC Edwards.<eos> I'm from Hackney Police.<eos> Do you recognise this man at all?
Would you both stay, just for a little bit?<eos> Of course we will.<eos> As long as you need us to.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I wanted to return this to you... make sure you got it.
Do you live with our Aunt Josephine?<eos> I am your Aunt Josephine.<eos> - You are?<eos> - Yes, of course.<eos> - Are you sure?
The police were sent some surveillance footage I wanted to ask you about.<eos> That's...<eos> That's not me, okay? I don't know where you got that,<eos> - but it's not me.<eos> - You're under arrest for aiding and abetting a felon, accessory after the fact, conspiracy...
Madam President.<eos> I saw Supergirl had a hostile alien to deal with this morning.<eos> Yes. It seems to be another one-off incident.<eos> It's under control.<eos> - Is that why you called?
At the moment it seems to be in low orbit.<eos> No communication or signs of activity for days.<eos> But according to Mon-El, the Daxamite we've been working with, they could be dangerous.<eos> I was afraid of that.<eos> How would you like to proceed?
- My son.<eos> You've betrayed me, my love.<eos> I'm not done with this world.<eos> - Lena Luthor?<eos> - Who are you?
I don't want anything coming in between us.<eos> Please trust me.<eos> DeAnn Anderson to see Adam.<eos> Of course.<eos> Can I get you anything?
Maybe there's nothing there, and you won't go to jail.<eos> But you still have to deal with the perception of it.<eos> Murder-suicide at the Institute of the Higher Mind, ongoing investigation... visualize the press running with that.<eos> And close your eyes if it helps.<eos> How much do you want?
The tools we found at the school had your son's blood on them.<eos> But we are continuing our search.<eos> I have volunteers coming in from Sudbury, and dog teams are arriving this morning from Toronto.<eos> But it's too late.<eos> That's what you're saying, isn't it?
and he won't be harming anyone anymore.<eos> Fraser worked at the store where we believe Katie bought this.<eos> That's where he saw her?<eos> Possibly.<eos> I didn't know if you'd want it back or not.
Uh, IDENT guys told me to bring this in.<eos> What on earth is that?<eos> It's part of the crime.<eos> I didn't ask for details.<eos> They told me to put it in the evidence freezer, said you'd give me the door code.
The patient has stabilised, her vitals are good.<eos> Can I talk to you?<eos> What the hell is going on?<eos> Did that guy just try to kill her?<eos> Do you recognise her?
I bid on it myself.<eos> It was quite the coup at the time.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Are you aware that the same painting was bought by Mr. Brandyce ten years ago for $2 million?
But perhaps you do know that from a financial point of view, Monaco is the best place to die.<eos> Or the best place for funds to be held in probate.<eos> I cannot believe Madame can be so naive.<eos> Death duties in France amount to 50% of all inheritance. In Monaco, they simply don't exist.<eos> Are you telling me you know nothing of such financial matters?
I want justice for Poussey.<eos> I want our demands met."<eos> - That's right. - All right.<eos> Now, do you want me to be off-book, or should I go out with this?<eos> Oh, you can have it with you.
I have a hot plate and a fridge I can move downstairs.<eos> Any luck, we can go weeks without seeing each other.<eos> Well, there it is.<eos> I understand it's an unusual condition, and I've priced the property to reflect that.<eos> - How many kids do you have?
Good.<eos> I wasn't thinking straight.<eos> Tell me more about the Blue Cat Lodge.<eos> - What do you want?<eos> - What do you want?
Oh, most people didn't spend the summer in Zurich during law school.<eos> Oh! That explains the suit.<eos> You're a lawyer.<eos> She said with an undertone of derision.<eos> And what do you do that's so amazing?
- I'm Detective Gaffey, LAPD.<eos> - She has something on us.<eos> Murder/suicide at the Institute of the Higher Mind,<eos> - ongoing investigation.<eos> - How much do you want?
Anyone with a grudge?<eos> That brick could be some random with a sick sense of humour.<eos> His death was reported as Jamie Marshall, wasn't it?<eos> So whoever lobbed this brick knew his real identity.<eos> Ma'am. You're going to want to see this.
- Jesus.<eos> Enough already, will ya? - I just. I saw it.<eos> You represent the Bureau.<eos> Judge Dawkins?<eos> Can you open up, please?
- Rippin' on you.<eos> - Yeah, you think so?<eos> Judge Dawkins!<eos> Zeke Sikes!<eos> Can you open up, please?
All right, where's my tape?<eos> We'll give it to you when we come pick up the bag. No!<eos> I don't want the bag!<eos> I want the tape!<eos> We need you to hold on to the money for a couple days until things cool off a bit.
It was on the RSVP. You put it there yourself.<eos> Pardon me.<eos> And how are you so sure you're not with the singles?<eos> If there are couples at your table, they could be what's called "swingers."<eos> How well do you know the bride and groom, Mr. Kepp?
Frankie!<eos> Oh, God.<eos> What happened to the people that were in this car?<eos> They have me right when I pulled him down. He was driving like a crazy man.<eos> - Okay, did you see a little boy?
Come on down.<eos> Come on, honey. I'm here to help you.<eos> What the hell is going on here?<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> - Who are you?
She was the worst, and also the best.<eos> And this one?<eos> I have not worked in many months.<eos> It was to be of her.<eos> You cannot finish it, so you abandoned it.
And this one?<eos> I have not worked in many months.<eos> It was to be of her.<eos> You cannot finish it, so you abandoned it.<eos> Perhaps to see you work, it would help Jakob.
No.<eos> You're not.<eos> My patience, however, is at its breaking point.<eos> Take a seat. Please.<eos> If you insist.
They thrived, and have grown to a proud maturity in my zoo.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Herr Heck has taken over the Berlin Zoo from his father.<eos> And his brother runs the Munich Zoo.<eos> Would you like a canapé, Herr Heck?
I didn't know that you thought so little of me, Dr. Zabiński.<eos> I devoted my life to the study of genetics, and I'm well practiced in the study of animal breeding.<eos> I'm an expert in that field.<eos> And I think I know more than anyone.<eos> Even more than you.
You've packed your things.<eos> The war's turning.<eos> I've been ordered back to Berlin.<eos> What bad luck for us.<eos> We'll be sorry to see you go.
You did the right thing, son.<eos> Man: Turn to the right.<eos> Yeah, the FBI just processed him and they transferred him over to Pearl Street.<eos> Yeah, we're heading in right now.<eos> So you were making money off of the trades.
- I made them up.<eos> - Weren't there statements?<eos> - Every month, they were fake.<eos> Purchase dates, they were fake; Shares, they were fake; Options, they were fake;<eos> Returns, they were fake. So when was the last trade you executed?
- But what?<eos> He would always say, "You run your business and I'll run my business."<eos> And you never thought to follow up on those questions?<eos> - You don't understand... - You're right, I don't.<eos> I don't understand how you could work in the same office as your father for 20 years and suspect nothing.
Man:<eos> Agent: What did Bernie Madoff say to you?<eos> Yeah? Man: Frank, my brother, is in the office...<eos> What the fuck?<eos> How old were you when you first started working for Bernie Madoff?
- Bernie: Yes. - Because he trusted you.<eos> He did what you told him to.<eos> - And you told him to do things that exposed him to this criminal liability he's facing right now.<eos> How did you justify that, Bernie?<eos> How did you sleep with that?
There was a little bit of, you know... look, you know, and they didn't wanna look too hard.<eos> They looked just far enough.<eos> - So they're accomplices in some way, too.<eos> - Bernie. Accomplices because they trusted you?<eos> Accomplices because you were so trustworthy, you seemed so trustworthy.
- Bernie. Accomplices because they trusted you?<eos> Accomplices because you were so trustworthy, you seemed so trustworthy.<eos> Yeah, but there's a lack of honesty on their behalf, an unwillingness to take responsibility for their behavior.<eos> - Your investors?<eos> It takes a lot of chutzpah for you of all people to say that.
Oh, um, by the way, are these securities with the DTC?<eos> - We're gonna need your account number just so we can verify the assets.<eos> Oh, Bern, you're fucking killing me.<eos> 646.<eos> Great, thank you. Do you mind if you take that jacket off before you go out there?
Even if you had told me, I'm not sure I would've turned you in.<eos> I don't know what that says about me.<eos> That's the tragedy of it.<eos> Reporter: Mr. Madoff, are you scared you're gonna lose your home?<eos> Mr. Madoff, what do you have to say to all of the people...
Reporter: Mr. Madoff, are you scared you're gonna lose your home?<eos> Mr. Madoff, what do you have to say to all of the people...<eos> - Stephanie: What the hell is wrong with you? !<eos> - Stephanie: Can you put the camera down?<eos> Do you feel guilty?
Bonnie was a killer.<eos> Bonnie killed people.<eos> For 16 years, I kept this secret from my wife, from my brother, my sons.<eos> How I was able to do that and maintain any degree of sanity, well, that... that worries me when I think about it.<eos> You already mentioned that.
How I was able to do that and maintain any degree of sanity, well, that... that worries me when I think about it.<eos> You already mentioned that.<eos> Yeah, I did.<eos> But while we're on the subject, you say you wanted to protect your family.<eos> Right. But just an example, what would have happened if at some point before the crisis of '08, you'd been hit by a bus, you'd drop dead?
They would've been, Bernie.<eos> They would've been held responsible, which means one of two things is true. Either they actually were guilty and accepted the risks or you were willing to let your sons go to jail for the crime you committed. Which is it, Bernie?<eos> I do like jousting with you.<eos> I'm not jousting with you, Bernie. - Yeah, well...<eos> It seems to me like... like you're refusing to recognize that hazard you created for your family.
- What do you care?<eos> Well, I wasn't always blind.<eos> Suzanne?<eos> Suzanne Dutchman, meet Bill Oakland.<eos> How do you do, Mr. Oakland?
- My first victim.<eos> That's okay.<eos> I don't mind.<eos> I'm sure I can get another appointment in a couple weeks.<eos> - How long can you hold out?
Ma, do you think there's any way that, like, maybe that guy's okay?<eos> I saw his brains.<eos> Why can't you just make me feel better?<eos> Oh, my god. Thank you so much.<eos> You are such a sweetie.
What?<eos> Hector morgado?<eos> This is...<eos> Honey, he's nervous.<eos> Wait, where are you going?
For all the wrongs we have committed to one another.<eos> It is the single act of kindness that god requires of us.<eos> You're looking for a room, sir?<eos> Can't do much better.<eos> And if you can, I dare you to find it.
But Sir, I left with nothing more than fond memories.<eos> Now, perhaps I may have neglected to say goodbye to her the next morning only because she was exhausted...<eos> - .. and I did not want to wake her.<eos> - Ok. And the reward for my gracious consideration?<eos> Well Sir, as you can see "Hell hath no fury".
Make yourself comfortable.<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> Who am I?<eos> The more relevant question, Mr. Morton is:<eos> Who exactly are you?
That's really your plan?<eos> You heard Ahmanet.<eos> Your curse cannot be broken.<eos> I am truly sorry, Mr. Morton.<eos> No matter what I do, you are going to die.
Let me give you a call, We will arrange an interview for you With a bank employee. Once someone is available.<eos> What will this device do?<eos> It will shine and shake.<eos> The red lights will turn in a circle.<eos> You can not miss it.
Not you!<eos> In the position of the cat!<eos> And keep putting money, come on.<eos> You can take this.<eos> I am sorry that you are the victim of a corrupt regime No longer serve people.
At the same time Carried out by three elderly men. Stole $ 2.3 million. Of the Williamsburg Savings Bank.<eos> Amazing, what a great profit.<eos> I was working in a house of terror Between 2 and 4 pm?<eos> That's what I said.<eos> Did you never leave that game?
- Good. Done. - Turn it up!<eos> No, all the way up!<eos> It's taking forever.<eos> That's as good as it gets.<eos> Well, can't you engineer, brain something up to make it go faster?
Someone here for you.<eos> Mr. Matt!<eos> Mr. Matt, I'm sorry for what happened to your friend.<eos> Uh, why are you here?<eos> - You say you bring water to the school.
I understand.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Very grateful. Thank you.<eos> Kadeer, um, you said we were talking to the wrong people.<eos> Could you explain to the people here what we're doing, why we're here?
Working with the Americans is very dangerous.<eos> How can you guarantee their safety?<eos> Well, they won't be seen collaborating with us.<eos> Everything goes through you.<eos> You talk to them. You bring them to the pumping station.
Everything goes through you.<eos> You talk to them. You bring them to the pumping station.<eos> Nobody has to know.<eos> Look, it's your terms, okay?<eos> You bring us the workers, we give the water at the pumping station.
I will speak with them.<eos> Hey, machmoud.<eos> Sergeant Harper, main gate.<eos> Looks like your hajjis are here.<eos> Could you come down and verify, please?
- There's no disrespect. - Please.<eos> Nice and slow.<eos> Okay. Okay. Perfect.<eos> Perfect.<eos> Yeah. Can you move this? Move this.
- How long does he need?<eos> - Uh, two or three days.<eos> Great.<eos> Have at it.<eos> So you, um... You speak English too?
What are you eating?<eos> Mre.<eos> This is, uh... penne and vegetable.<eos> - It's good?<eos> - Yeah, you want some?
Sergeant Harper...<eos> Three weeks' leave to return with us in riyadh.<eos> Roger, sir.<eos> Private ocre.<eos> What do you say we get you back on level ground?
Roger, sir.<eos> Private ocre.<eos> What do you say we get you back on level ground?<eos> There's a convoy leaving at 1400.<eos> It'll take you to the balad flightline and a c-130 will take you back to the states.
What'd he say?<eos> It's, uh, god's plan.<eos> Then he asked if I smoke.<eos> So, uh, he gives me these and said maybe I should consider starting.<eos> How about you? What you thinking about?
- Ooh, garlic fries.<eos> I start thinking about that, and all this other shit starts rushing back, you know?<eos> I haven't even thought about home for a long time.<eos> Did I tell you some captain told me to blouse my boots today?<eos> Can you believe that shit?
No, I...<eos> I broke my own hand back in Kuwait. I slammed it in a Hummer door.<eos> Just... trying to get out of all this shit.<eos> Well, now you can.<eos> Hey, you want these?
You're a good man, Mr. Wilson.<eos> I respect you for that.<eos> Ya fucking prick.<eos> Excuse me, sir.<eos> Are you all right?
Excuse me?<eos> Beautiful.<eos> Extraordinary.<eos> A man of taste. He was talking about me.<eos> Well, wherever you are... I'm just going to warm myself by the fire.
- Are there any leads on the fisherman? Where are you?<eos> This is starting to look very suspicious.<eos> What are you not telling me?<eos> I cannot just sit on my ass and wait for the sun to come up. I need you to tell me where you are, immediately.<eos> Okay, you know what, you call me if there's any further developments.
You transferred a large amount of money and were implicated in a double homicide after that.<eos> The fisherman made me transfer the money. There's a boat sunk in the sea.<eos> What do you... what do you think I did?<eos> You think I tried to fake drown myself in a boat?<eos> It looks like you were either involved in a money laundering scheme or you paid the fisherman to get rid of your family and then you got rid of him. I'm not talking to you anymore.
That means we can get to Jorge, we can make him lead...<eos> Mr. Riley, the search has been called off.<eos> - Okay, the search is over. - What, why?<eos> Why?<eos> Because you're an American citizen who is in custody and they just think you murdered two of their nationals, that's why.
Mr. Riley, the search has been called off.<eos> - Okay, the search is over. - What, why?<eos> Why?<eos> Because you're an American citizen who is in custody and they just think you murdered two of their nationals, that's why.<eos> What are you gonna do, leave them out there to die?
I'm trying to help you.<eos> There's nothing else that I can do for you, listen...<eos> - ...my hands are tied.<eos> I'm trying to help...<eos> - What if you're wrong?
Actually, the lease was terminated on the slip yesterday.<eos> - Are you saying that the boat isn't there?<eos> - That's right, man.<eos> Sorry, but your fishing trip might not happen after all.<eos> You know, you can rent a boat from one of the locals if you want.
What kind of cards you write, Wentworth?<eos> Romance.<eos> Romance.<eos> So every time I forget to give one of your mushy-ass cards to my girl, I get cut off for a month.<eos> Perhaps if you were well-endowed, you wouldn't need one of my cards.
Those types are everywhere.<eos> I'm just saying.<eos> Hey, what's shaking?<eos> Why is everybody so much more depressed than usual?<eos> Jeez Louise, Mr. Wentworth, did you get into a car accident?
A shoe.<eos> It hit me in the face.<eos> Somebody's shoe.<eos> So, what's up?<eos> Didn't you hear?
A lot.<eos> I pushed him around.<eos> I didn't kill him, though.<eos> I don't recognize you.<eos> Did you attend the company picnics, huh?
No, no, no.<eos> No, that belongs to my brother, Dilly.<eos> Well, Mr. Wentworth, they tell me that you were Card Writer of the Year in 2005, '06 and '07.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Also that you're divorced, you live alone, and you like to watch Bumfights.
Said there was only one ever better.<eos> Yeah, well, his wife is distraught.<eos> Mmm. Someone ought to send her a card.<eos> Fuck cards!<eos> Did you have him killed?
That is a hefty accusation, Mr. Wentworth.<eos> Perhaps you should take that up with the police.<eos> Hello, darling!<eos> The word is, you have a sweetheart, Mr. Wentworth.<eos> How do you know?
I thought Styvesan worked for you.<eos> Among many others.<eos> But this girlfriend of yours, congratulations.<eos> That's good, that's very good.<eos> I mean, after all, you need to feel the feelings before you can write about them.
You've been a fool for love before.<eos> You've got the gene for it.<eos> No.<eos> I'm a cynic.<eos> No, I'm a cynic. You're cynical.
No.<eos> I'm a cynic.<eos> No, I'm a cynic. You're cynical.<eos> There's a difference.<eos> I never believed in the first place, but you, you wake up every morning disappointed to find the world the way it is because you're a dreamer.
It's a DC number.<eos> -Who is it? -I think...<eos> Yes, it's the Speaker.<eos> Great, great, great, great.<eos> Mr. Speaker, before you say anything, I want you to know
Why would I want to break your window? How the fuck would I know?<eos> Dude.<eos> Just tell me the truth.<eos> I came here to pay for your lame-ass window, not to hear you talk.<eos> You have no idea what we're going through right now, okay?
My boyfriend. He wants to kill me and take her.<eos> And that's your daughter?<eos> Yes.<eos> I know you're still good inside.<eos> I know you want to help us.
We won't need it.<eos> Stay here.<eos> Evening, Mr. Munson.<eos> What brings y'all this way?<eos> Why don't you ask your boys?
Motherfucking...<eos> Shit!<eos> Welcome back.<eos> I was starting to think I was gonna have to tell... that nice little girl out in the waiting room... her daddy's gone.<eos> I'd always hoped... that I'd get the chance to meet someone like you.
What you need is rest, and treatment.<eos> You need to check yourself in somewhere.<eos> - I'll be fine.<eos> - No, you're not!<eos> I mean, I know that you're different... but that doesn't change the fact that something inside you is poisoning you.
- Has he had any problems at school?<eos> Nothing that we're aware of.<eos> - Home?<eos> - No.<eos> Why do you ask?
It's kind of you to think of me.<eos> Seems like you haven't had it easy, and you've always done good by your kid.<eos> I'm late for my shift.<eos> The incident was unfortunate, but nothing that we feel requires... Unfortunate?<eos> Sir, are you on drugs?
It's not the same exact situation, Neil, because you don't have a wife and kids, so you don't know what the fuck you're talking about.<eos> Listen... I...<eos> Come on, man, you gotta help me out here.<eos> Look, this has been a huge day for me, Mr. Campbell.<eos> Do you know how many hits we've got on the newspaper website?
Hi.<eos> Hey. Back so soon?<eos> - Yeah, I'm gonna need another one.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Oh, and do you mind spreading this one around a little bit?
If you have a problem with a bully, I need you to speak to a teacher.<eos> No... I am a teacher.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> It's actually another teacher who's gonna beat me up after school,<eos> - so that's why I'm calling. - I'm sorry, can you repeat what you just told me?
You chill.<eos> Okay. Look, look, look.<eos> Be a good boy. Sell me some drugs.<eos> Okay. Just relax.<eos> What do you want?
Well, I just sell molly.<eos> Then why are you asking me what do I want, Neil?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Okay, Neil. Sell me an eighth of Molly or whatever it is.<eos> Do you even know what molly is?
Do I trust either of them?<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> All right, we got this.<eos> Yeah, we got this.<eos> You stay out this shit, Mehar.
I'm sorry, what's going on?<eos> I was supposed to start at 2:15.<eos> Superintendent Johnson and I were just talking about his fishing trip to Alaska.<eos> I caught a halibut.<eos> You... You caught a halibut.
Yeah!<eos> But boo-fucking-hoo!<eos> I can be a dick, too.<eos> You wanna see me be a dick?<eos> Hmm. So what do you teach here?
Tea from a cop station.<eos> Get used to it.<eos> You'd better shut shop. Or, I'll make it difficult for you to even breathe.<eos> The air of Gujarat is replete with business.<eos> You can stop me from breathing. Can you stop the air?
Well, I believe that I... ..can.<eos> But Charlie was our whole world, Mr Holmes.<eos> Sherlock?<eos> Mr Holmes?<eos> Sorry, you were saying?
It's quite simple, superficial, to be blunt.<eos> But first, tell me, the night of the break-in, this room was in darkness?<eos> Well, yes.<eos> And the porch where it was smashed, I noticed the motion sensor was damaged, so I assume it's permanently lit.<eos> How did you notice that?
One, the actual passenger seat, the other, a good copy. Well, good enough.<eos> Effectively a costume.<eos> You're joking?<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> All he wanted was for you to get close enough to the car so he could spring the surprise.
They get retired in a pretty permanent sort of way.<eos> Not on my watch.<eos> 'My darling, I need to tell you this 'because you mustn't hate me for going away.'<eos> Pardon me, I can hear a squeaking.<eos> Can you hear a squeaking?
'My darling, I need to tell you this 'because you mustn't hate me for going away.'<eos> Pardon me, I can hear a squeaking.<eos> Can you hear a squeaking?<eos> Only I watched a documentary on the Discovery Channel -<eos> Why Planes Fail. Did you see it?
Sir?<eos> Sir.<eos> Sir, are you okay?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Do you speak English?
My name is Riley.<eos> My name is Nance.<eos> Do you have any food?<eos> Of course. We have plenty of food.<eos> How long have you been here?
Do you have any food?<eos> Of course. We have plenty of food.<eos> How long have you been here?<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> How long have you been here? Oh, geez.
We thought we were alone.<eos> So... There is no one else.<eos> You found no one.<eos> Just you.<eos> Are you alone here?
Just you.<eos> Are you alone here?<eos> When everyone disappeared, i left the city.<eos> I thought if the world is going to end, I will come here where shortly I'll join them.<eos> Were you in Iceland when it happened?
She left you?<eos> She didn't need to.<eos> She was already absent.<eos> But soon I spent more and more time on the sea.<eos> There was nothing you could do?
There was nothing you could do?<eos> How is that fair?<eos> The world is the world.<eos> You cannot fault it for not behaving as you believe it should.<eos> So you don't believe that we've been led here to find each other?
We're just scholars and scientists.<eos> We need someone with experience.<eos> In case things go sideways.<eos> Men go to war in search of something, Mr. Conrad.<eos> If you'd found it, you'd be home by now.
You're making a mistake.<eos> Your lies got my men killed!<eos> And you're gonna get us all killed!<eos> Not our fight.<eos> Whose side are you on, captain?
How can you be sure?<eos> He might have tried.<eos> No, if Sherlock Holmes wants to get in touch, that's not something you can fail to notice.<eos> Well, now, won't you introduce me?<eos> Mr Smith, will you say something about your property...
Do you ever look in the mirror and want to see someone else?<eos> - No, do you own an American car?<eos> - I'm sorry?<eos> No, not American, left-hand drive, that's what I mean. No.<eos> Why do you ask?
Not sure, actually, probably just noticed something.<eos> _<eos> Are you OK?<eos> Oh, of course you don't own a car, you don't need one, do you, living in isolation, no human contact, no visitors.<eos> - OK, how do you know that?
I don't have a coat.<eos> Yes, what I just noticed. I wonder why.<eos> Who are you talking to?<eos> Piss off!<eos> So what do you think?
Your life is not your own!<eos> Keep your hands off it, do you hear me?<eos> Off it. Off it.<eos> Sorry? What?<eos> What are you talking about?
Yes, hello?<eos> Is this Dr John Watson?<eos> Yeah, who's this?<eos> Culverton Smith.<eos> You've probably heard of me.
Get me a fresh glass of water, please, this one's filthy.<eos> 'I mean, I'm aware of this morning's developments.'<eos> Yes, I'm sure he was being hilarious.<eos> Sorry, did you say "all still meeting"?<eos> 'You, me and Mr Holmes.'
My God, he knows you!<eos> No, he doesn't.<eos> I'm in your head, John.<eos> You're disagreeing with yourself.<eos> Are you ready, sir?
Oh, no.<eos> No, not endless.<eos> Need another hit, do you?<eos> I can wait until the hospital.<eos> Are you involved much?
Um, with Mr Holmes, Sherlock, in all his cases?<eos> Er, yeah, I'm John Watson.<eos> OK.<eos> Dr Watson.<eos> I love his blog, don't you?
I sent a text from your phone, remember? It was read almost immediately.<eos> Factoring in a degree of shock and emotional decision, and a journey time based on the associated address, I'd say that your life, as you know it, has 20 minutes left to run.<eos> Well, no, 17½ to be precise, but I rounded up for dramatic effect.<eos> So, please do show us your favourite room.<eos> It'll give you a chance to say goodbye.
Well, all that effort.<eos> You don't build a beach if you want to hide a pebble.<eos> You just find a beach.<eos> And if you want to hide a murder, if you want to hide lots and lots of murders, just find a hospital.<eos> Can we be clear? Are you confessing?
But that's just my USP. I use it to sell breakfast cereal.<eos> But am I what he says I am?<eos> Is that what you're asking?<eos> Well, let me ask you this...<eos> are you really a doctor?
You know, not just feet or media studies or something?<eos> I'm a doctor.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> No, really, are you?<eos> Are you... are you actually serious?
I think you need to tell your faithful little friend how you're wasting his time, because you're too high to know what's real any more.<eos> I apologise.<eos> I... I've miscalculated.<eos> I forgot to factor in the traffic. 19½ minutes.<eos> Ah, the footsteps you're about to hear will be very familiar to you, not least because there'll be three impacts rather than two.
Now, let's see if I can recall.<eos> "Faith, I can stand it no longer, I've confessed to my crimes.<eos> "Please forgive me."<eos> Why would that have any effect?<eos> You don't know her.
Killing my wife is what you are doing.<eos> No!<eos> OK, fine.<eos> John?<eos> Dr Watson, are you married?
Dr Watson, are you married?<eos> I was.<eos> - What happened?<eos> - She died.<eos> What would you give to get her back?
You don't recognize me?<eos> Perhaps from my youth!<eos> Super Colossal Big Fat Boss Baby?<eos> He is him?<eos> And him is you?
- How long?<eos> - Thirty minutes without a heartbeat.<eos> Stop. Stop CPR. She's gone.<eos> She's gone.<eos> Mr. Shepherd, are you there?
- I am not sure.<eos> Come on.<eos> I have married many couples.<eos> There were no state records.<eos> Do you keep any?
I've always been fascinated with Okja and her monthly health reports and data. she amazes me even more.<eos> This is it.<eos> The moment of mutual trust between Mirando's very own Dr. Johnny and the esteemed local farmer.<eos> She's truly exceptional.<eos> How did you do it?
Mija! Mija!<eos> Excuse me!<eos> I'm here for Okja!<eos> Use the phone.<eos> could you come to the lobby?
Ruth. Ruth, are you in there?<eos> My goodness. Come on. Come on, Armstrong.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on, Armstrong. Come on. Come on, little you.<eos> Yes, hello? Yeah, you don't know me.
I don't know right now.<eos> He's our maintenance man.<eos> But I saw him out back a little while ago.<eos> Harvey? Harvey, you son of a bitch!<eos> Are you Hank?
Who's Chip?<eos> That's Barney's brother.<eos> We need a key from Chip.<eos> I was just on my way, but h... How did you know?<eos> Well, do you have a phone number for Chip?
A little companionship?<eos> On the house.<eos> Think of us as a home away from home.<eos> Home.<eos> And do you live around here?
Or night.<eos> That's right.<eos> We're watching you, Mr...<eos> We're on Lancelot Court.<eos> You don't know your address?
So I had a man out here recently to look at the furnace, and, Sheriff Truman, he wouldn't answer any of my questions about what happens when no one's here.<eos> We come in early, and the heat is still on.<eos> What if we came in even earlier?<eos> Would the heat still be on then?<eos> Are you next to a loud stream, Sheriff Truman?
What if we came in even earlier?<eos> Would the heat still be on then?<eos> Are you next to a loud stream, Sheriff Truman?<eos> You're breaking up.<eos> Are you still fishing?
Would the heat still be on then?<eos> Are you next to a loud stream, Sheriff Truman?<eos> You're breaking up.<eos> Are you still fishing?<eos> Are you next to a really loud stream?
You're gonna need some change. Some change.<eos> Some change.<eos> Well, how do you want it? You gonna play a game?<eos> Game.<eos> What game are you gonna play?
But if it's real, we have to alert the FBI.<eos> I'm booking the flight.<eos> First class, Cindy.<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> I have to ask you to stop smoking.
I told you to be on your way half an hour ago, sir.<eos> There's no loitering here.<eos> What's your name, sir? What's your name, sir?<eos> Dougie Jones.<eos> And where do you live, Mr. Jones?
Fuck you, Albert.<eos> Look at this.<eos> Cooper 25 years ago... Cooper in prison two days ago.<eos> Identical, right? Maybe.<eos> What do you see?
He hasn't seen it in a few days, so, yes, there's a very strong possibility that it was stolen.<eos> Stolen.<eos> All right, then, Mr. Jones, where did you last leave your car?<eos> Well, if we knew that, we'd know where to find it, wouldn't we?<eos> Okay, can you describe your vehicle, please?
Yeah, I'll tell you a reason.<eos> There's more to life than cars.<eos> Too many cars, too much going on, and Dougie's been under a lot of stress lately, and if you want to know the truth, so have I.<eos> Officers, have you found the car?<eos> Who are you, sir?
Okay. Would you state your name and age for the record?<eos> William Hastings.<eos> Mr. Hastings, are you the author of an online journal or blog entitled The Search for the Zone?<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> What sort of things do you write about?
Yes, but it's real.<eos> It's all real.<eos> How long have you been interested in this subject, Mr. Hastings? Many years.<eos> I do... I do a lot of reading.<eos> But this time, you wrote that you actually found and entered such a place.
Were maybe gonna find him, and he wanted to go to a different place, and so he asked us to get him numbers.<eos> Important numbers.<eos> Coordinates.<eos> And we found them in the place he told us to go, a secure military database.<eos> Do you still have those coordinates?
Are you currently in the market to adopt a child?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Oh, yeah. - Wow.<eos> Are you looking for more of a base model orphan - or one that has more upgraded features? - Yep.
What can I do for you?<eos> Well, this is rather awkward.<eos> I'm wondering if you've had any contact with a man who's going by the name Danny?<eos> Mid-twenties, homeless... no shoes?<eos> Why do you ask?
He actually held a gun to my head.<eos> Why would he do that?<eos> Honestly...<eos> I think he has some serious mental problems.<eos> Uh, okay, so how did you find me?
He was always jumping around.<eos> Okay. Well, uh, thank you.<eos> That's it?<eos> Yeah, it was... it was an odd question.<eos> Why do you ask?
the family takes care of those.<eos> What if everyone in the family's dead?<eos> man.<eos> I just cut the grass.<eos> But you could ask in the office.
uh... can you help me?<eos> sure.<eos> What do you need?<eos> uh... just looking for an X-ray from a visit when I was a kid.<eos> I don't know. Do you have a date?
Who could force a giant business like Rand to do anything?<eos> The Hand.<eos> I had no idea.<eos> Please extend our deepest apologies to Miss Meachum.<eos> Do you have any idea what the Hand are doing with the pier?
- No.<eos> Mmm. But if you like, I can call Sarah Galvin in Transport and have her bring that information to you.<eos> I'm on my way down now, anyway.<eos> She's right off the elevator on the fourth floor.<eos> I'll let her know you're coming.
That's the last thing a control freak wants to hear.<eos> I'm gonna talk to him.<eos> Mr. Rand?<eos> Sorry, do I know you?<eos> I read about that drug thing you did in the paper.
I'll hire security guards.<eos> You can't trust anyone!<eos> Hey, hey, hey. Relax.<eos> - Take me back. Take me back. - Shh.<eos> No, you need to relax.
You don't look well.<eos> Mr. Rand?<eos> Hey.<eos> How are you?<eos> uh... You're not allowed here anymore.
Wow!<eos> so... please... call me Harold.<eos> I think...<eos> I think I'm gonna have this organic cornflakes one.<eos> Mmm. I don't think I've ever seen you eat any dairy or sugar.
- Are we really gonna do this?<eos> - What is that?<eos> What are we gonna do? send me back to some kind of cell.<eos> I know how the whole 72-hour-hold business works.<eos> Is that why you think you're here?
Did Colleen tell you everything about me?<eos> Not everything.<eos> Please, my office is this way.<eos> I understand when you say you're training people.<eos> Can I get you to sign this?
Just stay.<eos> I'll be back.<eos> Professor Chen.<eos> The results indicate that your health is back to normal.<eos> But we recommend you stay in the hospital a few more days for observations.
My bad.<eos> These belong to you.<eos> Mr. Lucas?<eos> Mr. Cage?<eos> - Which do you prefer? I forget.
- Do I know you?<eos> - Franklin Nelson.<eos> I ran point on your case.<eos> We spoke on the phone... a lot.<eos> You spoke a lot.
In case you need help starting over.<eos> I'm not starting over, Mr. Nelson.<eos> I'm moving forward.<eos> People call me Foggy.<eos> And you let them?
What?<eos> There's nowhere to go.<eos> They'll find me.<eos> They'll... they'll hurt me.<eos> To be honest, if you hurt my friend, I'm gonna hurt you worse.
To be honest, if you hurt my friend, I'm gonna hurt you worse.<eos> I was just trying to stop them.<eos> - They're gonna take down the city.<eos> - Who?<eos> I can't help you if you won't tell me who.
Look, I know that you think you're just doing your job, but I'm telling you, this case isn't normal.<eos> You are walking into some weird-ass shit.<eos> Jessica Jones, stop talking.<eos> Hi, this is over.<eos> Who the hell are you?
You'll die here tonight, old man.<eos> - Finally.<eos> - Don't you bet on it.<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> - Are you a public defender?
You're the Hand.<eos> And I'm gonna make sure...<eos> Mr. Rand.<eos> I appreciate your candor. And your passion.<eos> And I must say, considering what I've heard about you, you seem much more disciplined than I anticipated.
- Do you play?<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - The piano.<eos> - Uh, no.<eos> You?
Whatever they're gonna do with Danny Rand, it is not good for anyone.<eos> - Mr. Murdock. - Yes.<eos> Is that you, Detective?<eos> You're up.<eos> I've got one of your clients scared shitless across the hallway, and the other one passed out, so I'm gonna need for you to answer a few questions.
And you.<eos> Just a word. In private.<eos> I would like to explain to them how best to cooperate in building your case.<eos> Well, I hope they like what you have to say.<eos> Otherwise, and I warn you, I'm putting you in a room with two super-powered people.
Ceramic matrices.<eos> Accompanying laminates. Cutting-edge body armor.<eos> We just sew it between the fabric and the lining.<eos> Zero penetration. However... quite painful, I'm afraid.<eos> Could you recommend anything for the end of the night?
The marker is over.<eos> Mark it.<eos> If Mr. Wick isn't dead already, he soon will be.<eos> Will you mark it, sir?<eos> You have no idea, what's coming do you?
You incinerated the priest's temple.<eos> Burned it to the ground.<eos> Now he's free of the marker, what do you think he'll do?<eos> He had a glimpse of the other side, and he embraced it.<eos> But you, Signor D'Antonio... took it away from him.
Nothing. You demand nothing of me, Mr. D'Antonio.<eos> This kingdom is mine and mine alone.<eos> All right.<eos> Then enjoy your kingdom Winston, while you still can.<eos> And you, its privileges, sir.
You don't seem surprised to see me.<eos> Nope.<eos> Darling, you have someone very powerful working against you.<eos> I am so underfunded and understaffed.<eos> - And yet here you are.
So you're gonna take these horses away so they can spend the rest of their lives stacked on top of each other? Because of bullshit allegations whispered into a politician's ear.<eos> I have orders.<eos> These men may spend the night in jail.<eos> There may be guards all over the place. But when they're with these horses, they are free.<eos> And you're gonna take that away from them.
You're at the border.<eos> I'm afraid you can't stay here.<eos> Dusties, they're not kidding, you know?<eos> -Of course, yeah. I didn't know. -Wha--?<eos> You put yourself in peril, you're putting me in peril.
Wha--? Ask him if he ran into a camelcade.<eos> Why don't you ask him?<eos> I don't talk to stuff I don't know.<eos> Pardon me, sir.<eos> You wouldn't have come across a camelcade by any chance?
How do we resolve this?<eos> You know, she could be expelled.<eos> God. I hope not.<eos> But if any first-time offenders got expelled, well I guess fair is fair.<eos> Are you gonna take this serously? Sure.
Why not?<eos> By the time I heard about Diane... passing... the baby was gone already.<eos> Well, did you try and find her?<eos> Best I could. I couldn't just go and search the entire country.<eos> Do you use a computer at work?
It'll narrow it down.<eos> Eillen.<eos> Yeah, Hit enter.<eos> Page 2. Second hit.<eos> Would you please tell the court what you see there?
It was nothing.<eos> Diane was not like regular people.<eos> She was extrodinary.<eos> And extrodinary people come with singular issues and needs.<eos> You have no idea of capability she possesed.
Where are you currently employed? I repair boats.<eos> Oh, really? At which marina?<eos> I don't work at the marina.<eos> I freelance. So, safe to say, no health insurance. No.<eos> About a week before your sister took her life... what were you doing for a living then?
I was a teacher.<eos> You're being modest, aren't you?<eos> You were a professor at Boston University...<eos> Isn't that right? Yes, weel, assistant professor.<eos> And what'd you teach?
- Did she brake the boy's nose?<eos> - Yes. On October 16th last year, were you arrested for assault?<eos> Oh, my God. You have to answer the question, Mr. Adler.<eos> A drunk idiot attacked me and I defended myself.<eos> Did you spend the night in jail? Yeah.
And I need a immediate audience with the generals.<eos> You do not just barge in here. Sir with all due respect..<eos> What I saw in my last trip... will change the course of war.<eos> Captain Trevor!<eos> I heard we lost you in one of your mission... and yet here you are, back from the dead... and I see you brought a friend with you.
Sir, I can take...<eos> Now more than ever... the armistice is off paramount importance.<eos> It must be negotiated it must be signed..<eos> It's the best way of stopping the war.<eos> Captain, you will do nothing.
No...!<eos> Gentlemen, sit.<eos> Ms. Prince, sit..<eos> I assume you are here planning something... that's going to get you either court martial or killed.<eos> And I assume, you are here to stop us.
- Captain Trevor.<eos> - Yes sir.<eos> You're under no circumstances to go anywhere near that... gala tomorrow night. Do you hear me?<eos> You'll be jeopardizing everything we've worked for.<eos> You can not compromise the armistice.
Not here or in your country of origin?<eos> The family support center has been set up at a hotel nearby.<eos> You'll have access to medical and psychological treatments and social services.<eos> That's also where you'll be updated on any news that comes in.<eos> If you'd rather be alone, you can do that there, too.
Good. Like I said, I think it might help if you come to the family support center.<eos> In the area Hazmat crews, fire and police are on the scene.<eos> The Hazmat crews and the... there are going through the debris...<eos> - Hi, are you here to help with the search?<eos> Are you a relative or friend of any of the victims?
- I don't know, I haven't seen him since this morning.<eos> Come on, is he inside?<eos> Hey, man, get up!<eos> Come on, man, don't make me call the cops again, let's go.<eos> I'm sorry, man, but every time you spend the night out here, I get in trouble.
Our proposal will be exactly the same.<eos> James.<eos> Mr. melnyk, this is the framework agreement we're proposing to the families.<eos> I would like to just...<eos> It's a friendly agreement between you and the airline in which you agree to withdraw all claims and lawsuits from the company.
I read the story in the papers about your daughter's necklace.<eos> I thought it was nice that they used it as inspiration for the monument.<eos> Do you like it?<eos> Yes.<eos> What do you...
, , experiments, I heard that the agency knows about his work,<eos> Then carefully he built this place,<eos> He built the Secret Laboratory,<eos> He does not think I'm still alive, , , , so I'm sure he's here,<eos> Professor, can you help restore Ler?
Listen, the accounts told me that we have a leasehold of 50 years on the offices in West India docks, 32 years left to run.<eos> Your father hadnae been up there in eight years, sir.<eos> They're all locked up.<eos> Then I will need the key.<eos> Oi! What are you doing with the door?
Not kneel down beside them.<eos> Try again, this time reflecting the disgust you naturally feel now you know the truth.<eos> The dogs here live off the flesh from suicides jumping off Blackfriars Bridge.<eos> Never known one go tamely to a man's hand.<eos> Must be some witchcraft you picked up somewhere.

Mr Ibbotson, I've been meaning to pay you a visit.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> You're a liar just like your father.<eos> You're a Delaney. Tell you what...<eos> You get me an address, and I will get you payment in the form of a banker's draft.
Now, this is for the past, the present and the future.<eos> Take me to the boy.<eos> I want to see if you're lying to me or not.<eos> Yes, sir, Mr Delaney.<eos> Do you want to talk with him?
Yes, sir, Mr Delaney.<eos> Do you want to talk with him?<eos> No, I'm not a fit man to be around children.<eos> Fate can be hard, so you put money aside for his future in case he grows up to be rash, like me.<eos> Will you wish to see him again?
Please understand - hypocrisy I hate most.<eos> Indeed. Let us not pretend...<eos> No, do not pretend.<eos> I wonder if Mr Appleby might be allowed to finish a sentence?<eos> We are told that in your father's will, you were bequeathed a piece of territory which lies just here.
No, do not pretend.<eos> I wonder if Mr Appleby might be allowed to finish a sentence?<eos> We are told that in your father's will, you were bequeathed a piece of territory which lies just here.<eos> As you will see, the small piece of land your father bought off the Indians is now by virtue of geography a point of contention between His Majesty's Government and the cursed United States.<eos> Mr Delaney, you've been in Africa for a number of years, so you may be unaware that Britain and the United States are currently at war.
What consequences? Perhaps we should adjourn.<eos> Mr Delaney...<eos> I'll give you one last chance to behave like a loyal subject of His Majesty and the lawful crown of England. Like a loyal subject of His Majesty and the lawful crown of England.<eos> Sell this land for a reasonable price.<eos> The balance of your father's mind was, well, unstable... but you have no such excuse.
Perhaps they left early for the weekend.<eos> As will I, I think.<eos> How did this get here?<eos> Some errand boy delivered it, sir, from a Dr Dumbarton.<eos> Said you'd be expecting it?
From a man in Feather Lane.<eos> Look, it was cheaper than the tavern and, er, your father only gave me coppers.<eos> What man?<eos> A man who's since died... and his wife since left.<eos> Why do you ask?
13.<eos> Why would she keep you and not rent you?<eos> Too ugly.<eos> She says, one day, I'll catch a man and he'll carry me away.<eos> Someone like you.
You know navigation.<eos> Yes. Us larks all want to be sailors.<eos> That's his sloop.<eos> Right.<eos> Why do you even believe I'm telling the truth?
That's his sloop.<eos> Right.<eos> Why do you even believe I'm telling the truth?<eos> Because...<eos> What are you going to do?
The very same smell.<eos> Same smell as what?<eos> As your father's clothes when he would go dancing on the foreshore and light his fires.<eos> Brace, where did my father keep his most important things?<eos> What is it you're looking for?
Tribunal?<eos> Yeah. Or they'll proudly try to seize it and claim it as a spoil of war.<eos> Sir, I have seen nae deerskin treaty, nor have I seen fairies or water sprites.<eos> But what I do have are Malay coins, enough to bury you.<eos> Prayer beads, not enough to get you to heaven.
I made a fire in your room for the mice.<eos> In Parliament today, they'll be debating the beating of servants.<eos> The Whigs want to protect you.<eos> I believe that would lead to anarchy.<eos> Are you not ever hungry?
I ate in the whorehouse.<eos> To qualify as food, it needs to be solid.<eos> I made some coffee - that'll be stone-cold.<eos> Aren't we all?<eos> Where the hell are you going now?
Similar.<eos> You should know the wound in the shoulder is no longer used by us as a signal.<eos> No, we change the codes when we think that perhaps the scum British have overtaken it.<eos> And you do not trust the name Colonay?<eos> What do you want?
The shackles were all cast in London.<eos> The East India don't deal slaves.<eos> No, no, they don't.<eos> But they do run cloth and trade beads to Tangiers with the Scarfe family, and then slaves to Trinidad... from Bunce Island... through Spanish privateers.<eos> For one with such close connections, I am surprised that you don't know.
Are you a good actress?<eos> Your father thought so.<eos> And was that before or after he lost his mind?<eos> Well, love is a kind of madness, isn't it, Mr Thoyt?<eos> Or have you never experienced it?
Personally, I question the miasmatic theory of cholera, but even so, it's wise to take precautions.<eos> I'm assuming this disease is of your own making?<eos> So many soldiers and Company men treading heavily in your footsteps, I thought I'd make this place a little less attractive to them.<eos> That's why we've also moved down here.<eos> I'm busy. What do you want?
I write on behalf of humanity.<eos> As a man concerned with injustice.<eos> Against your people.<eos> Against people.<eos> For nine years, you have been campaigning for a Royal Commission to investigate the drowning of these 280 slaves, which you say was done deliberately.
First, I must tell you that I already know many things about you.<eos> I need to be clear that you're not a spirit, like the others.<eos> No. I'm a rationalist.<eos> I'm carrying out an investigation as part of a Royal Commission.<eos> I heard that you don't drink, that you don't fuck whores and, erm... that you're squeezing Sir Stuart Strange on behalf of the King.
I do.<eos> And yet you're a rationalist.<eos> What kind of rational man believes in justice?<eos> I'm investigating the sinking of a sloop called the Cornwallis, renamed the Influence, off the coast of Cabinda in July 1804.<eos> Mr. Delaney... I have strong reason to believe that you were aboard the ship the night it sank.

I have strong reason to believe that you were aboard the ship the night it sank.<eos> An example of the kind of nail you used to nail down the hold of the East India Company ship, the Cornwallis, when she ran aground... in July 1804.
You travelled to the Volta as a slave and then began to deal slaves.<eos> You stole diamonds from a fellow slaver and then returned to London.<eos> I have done much worse things than... stealing diamonds.<eos> Yes. I know this, too.<eos> What do you want?
You stole diamonds from a fellow slaver and then returned to London.<eos> I have done much worse things than... stealing diamonds.<eos> Yes. I know this, too.<eos> What do you want?<eos> As far as I can ascertain... you are the only surviving member of the crew of the Cornwallis.
Yes.<eos> How long have you worked for the East India Company? I have only been clerk for 12 years.<eos> I have no idea how many years it was going on for...<eos> No, but you were present during the meeting when Sir Stuart concealed the facts about the sinking of the Cornwallis.<eos> Would you agree to testify?

All right?<eos> Now, you can do that, can't you?<eos> Right. Right.<eos> We're good. Mr. Godfrey has decided he will do the honourable thing.<eos> Your testimony will be with you within the week.
We need the names of all the people who helped you manufacture the gunpowder... move the gunpowder, but most pressingly of all, we need the names of all the members of the Society of Secret Correspondence that you have dealt with.<eos> The Americans.<eos> The places you met. Code names, signals.<eos> The location of the powder you gave them.<eos> Now, if you can give me all that and what you tell us is corroborated, then... then these people won't be needed and you will await trial in the same cell that Thomas Moore occupied, with not an unpleasant view of the River Thames.
Well, in that case, Mr. Delaney, Sir Stuart Strange is busy.<eos> Give us the Americans and then we'll stop!<eos> Sir!<eos> What did you say?<eos> Mr. Delaney, what did you say?
Maybe the fishes, maybe not.<eos> The silver tooth is mine.<eos> Who has a blade for the dentistry?<eos> Relax, Mr. Delaney.<eos> You're in safe hands.
So just tell me what you want to say to Carlsbad, and I'll stitch you up and set you loose.<eos> Interesting knife they used to carve you up.<eos> Is that Chinese, you think? Or Malay?<eos> When you came in here with bits of a man's flesh between your teeth... we kind of had a silent deal.<eos> I stitch you up and you give me information.

You should know that I am a very dangerous man.<eos> I was told that, too.<eos> And who keeps telling you all this shit?<eos> I was told the details of your situation by a representative of his Majesty The King, George.<eos> And indirectly it was the King who financed the drawing up of that very expensive piece of paper, which you just burnt.
No.<eos> I'm willing to take care of the insurance of your ship.<eos> I can make sure the hull is tarred properly...<eos> They don't miss a layer and pocket the change.<eos> The salt and worms will get through and you'll sink off Africa.
You're as good as a hole in the hull.<eos> I did check the records.<eos> You were aboard a ship that sank off Africa. A slave ship?<eos> I believe that a man is capable of change... and I also believe that that is of no consequence to you.<eos> And whilst you're here, this document will show you... that my ship is already insured by an insurance broker by the name of Cope.

- Candie?<eos> What were you talking about to him out there on the floor?<eos> Candie!<eos> Oh... that we're in the version layer, that it's gonna be hot and smoggy tomorrow, and I told him that we are so lucky to have air-conditioning cooling our casino.<eos> Okay. Mr. Insurance Man, what do you want?
Here's to you, dougie.<eos> Mr. Jackpots!<eos> Oh. This is the man I told you about.<eos> I wanted to see you again.<eos> I've thought of you every day, What you did for me.
Coffee. It's on me.<eos> Coffee for the great Dougie Jones.<eos> Dougie Jones.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Hon, you want some cherry pie?
I'll give him your regards, sir.<eos> Uh, I just thought you should know this. Uh, it's gonna sound strange.<eos> Something's been found, something Deputy Chief Hawk found.<eos> Missing pages from a certain Laura Palmer's diary that could indicate two Coopers.<eos> I don't know any more than this, but, uh, I-I just thought you should know it.
And it doesn't makes sense. Ezra leaving Aria at the altar.<eos> Yeah, or why he would leave town without his packed bag?<eos> Mrs. Fitz!<eos> - No, I-I'm not Mrs. Fitz.<eos> - Who are you?
And Willy Dunne.<eos> - Right this way, boss.<eos> Yeah. - Willy was Glen's body man.<eos> Put your things in here.<eos> I'll let you spread them out how you like.
He's obviously in the wrong fucking job!<eos> That thing's off, right?<eos> I'm sorry to have to tell you this, General, but we're gonna sit on your report until after the Afghan elections.<eos> With all due respect, Madam Secretary, the election is a month away.<eos> I know it is but as I'm sure you know, an election here is a fragile thing.
Sir, as your senior PAO, I must counsel strongly against it.<eos> It would be foolhardy.<eos> I really don't think now's the time to court media attention.<eos> At the very moment, allegations are being made<eos> - that you leaked this report yourself.
They wanna know if you can spare time for a meeting on Air Force One tomorrow morning.<eos> The president wants some face time.<eos> Now he wants fucking face time.<eos> Fucking dick.<eos> So can you do that, boss?
General, this dinner is to honor you, sir.<eos> Wrong.<eos> This dinner is for Afghanistan.<eos> We are here tonight because we're at war in Afghanistan.<eos> And you got the goddamn gall to kick the only Afghan in the room - off my goddamn table? - I'm sorry...
I'm pretty sure the Afghan ambassador here is from Afghanistan.<eos> General.<eos> Sir.<eos> Swell.<eos> I don't want for this dinner to be awkward for you, General, so I will tell you now that we intend to give you our portion of the troops that you request.
No take off.<eos> Well, this is General Glen McMahon we're talking about here.<eos> Oh, General Glen McMahon.<eos> Oh, I did not know.<eos> Why didn't you say that?
We've made it clear to the whole city that's the thing to do.<eos> If I could just ask a question, General. Shoot!<eos> I know this is Marjah, but I'm still not quite clear as to why you're sending boys to Nawzad and Musa Qala.<eos> I mean, there's nothing out there.<eos> I'm just not quite clear what it is you're trying to control there.
- Oh, General, please come in.<eos> - Mr. President.<eos> Please sit here.<eos> Please, please sit. Sit.<eos> - How are you?
- What are those, 2.5?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Okay, give me one of those.<eos> My name is General Glen McMahon.<eos> On behalf of the coalition forces, I wanna apologize to you for the loss you've suffered here today.
Okay, give me one of those.<eos> My name is General Glen McMahon.<eos> On behalf of the coalition forces, I wanna apologize to you for the loss you've suffered here today.<eos> I know the money that Sergeant Ortega gave you can't bring back your family.<eos> But hopefully it can help you to rebuild, because rebuilding is what we're all about.
Okay. Let's go, Willy.<eos> Fall out.<eos> - Do you need anything, boss?<eos> - No. Thank you, Willy.<eos> Are you... are you sure you don't need me to come with you?
- It's a fine choice.<eos> You know the McLarens are like snowflakes and no two of them are the same.<eos> Is that true?<eos> Actually it doesn't, but... I still think it's a lovely image with the snowflake.<eos> Don't you think?
That's a great name, Quincy.<eos> I was named after my grandfather's dog.<eos> The legacy lives on.<eos> - Don't touch me.<eos> - Yeah. And where did you say you met Celeste?
- No. - August? - No.<eos> - No, no.<eos> - March.<eos> - No. - April.<eos> - You already said April.
Keep it close, my son.<eos> I don't think they will let me.<eos> Good afternoon, sir.<eos> Sir?<eos> Would you like to buy a ticket?
Yes, you did.<eos> So unless you have a written invitation to our home, you're not going anywhere near her.<eos> Hey, there's your clown suit.<eos> Alright, here's your...<eos> car... toon. I kept it close just like you asked me to, Paisano.
Which is an admission that he did try to choke her.<eos> No, just hold... hold on.<eos> Zigfield still maintains his innocence on the whole choking front.<eos> The idea of brandishing affection upon Amabella was first proffered by Chloe in an attempt to ameliorate the whole birthday party brouhaha.<eos> I'm sorry. Excuse me. Are you saying Chloe had something to do with this?
Claudia's Jeep.<eos> Oh, wait, wait, so, now I'm supposed to trust Peter Hale?<eos> I want you to trust me.<eos> I heard Stiles on that radio, I'm sure of it.<eos> - If you had heard it too...
Can't we just buy a lightning rod?<eos> Sure, if you've got $2500.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> This is faculty only.<eos> Then why are you the one leaving?
This is faculty only.<eos> Then why are you the one leaving?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Plugs and wires? Are...<eos> Are you making a Taser?
Some of the kids were running.<eos> But for everyone else it, it was like there was nothing there.<eos> They couldn't see a thing.<eos> We did.<eos> And we've got a lot more to tell you if you really wanna fight back.
It is him.<eos> Usually he's in disguise, But I saw him once at a bistro in paris, Which he then gave a rather nasty review.<eos> Will you excuse me?<eos> Sure.<eos> I'm sorry. I know I shouldn't say anything, But I know who you are.
This is a memento of my first and late wife, Rajo. Netaji, Rajo's last memento.<eos> For the Indian National Army.<eos> This is from me.<eos> - Splendid!<eos> Do you not miss the screen, Mr. Billimoria?
Please trust us.<eos> - This one.<eos> This is the frame, take it out.<eos> Sorry?<eos> What were you saying?
It's a she..<eos> Yes, this ass here is a woman.<eos> Sergeant!<eos> - Sir!<eos> You go on ahead.
Me! Me! Me!<eos> Oh David, your life is far too important.<eos> What if I miss?<eos> I need someone whose life can be sacrificed.<eos> How about you, Sergeant Nawab Malik?
Oh David, your life is far too important.<eos> What if I miss?<eos> I need someone whose life can be sacrificed.<eos> How about you, Sergeant Nawab Malik?<eos> Where are you?
- This is gonna be badass!<eos> - It means a lot to me.<eos> Hell, yeah. All right, later.<eos> All right, take care, man.<eos> Do you have a favorite artist?
- What are you doing, boy?<eos> Could you not see what I was holding up?<eos> Okay. Lower the music, please.<eos> "CHP Widows' Fund Gold Donor." What is this?<eos> Are you a widow?
Oh, no, it's from the gold donor program, used to be a guaranteed warning.<eos> We usually just tell them that the policy ended, and let 'em go.<eos> - We should grab a drink.<eos> - Really? - Mmm-hmm.<eos> Okay, come with me. You're going to take a free ride now.
Yeah.<eos> I'll see you around.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Pull a fucking gun on me?<eos> - I didn't know it was you!
Could you and SS-Gruppenfuhrer Kellermann step behind the table and look at some notes or a map?<eos> The new flag for the event with our Russian friends.<eos> Foto.<eos> I think they've made the cross of St George a little too small?<eos> - Could you point at it? - Yeah.
Is it murder?<eos> Murder at the antiques shop, wasn't it, Mr Archer?<eos> It was in the early edition.<eos> Detective Bob Sheenan.<eos> You like 'em soft, don't you, Mr Archer?
Murder at the antiques shop, wasn't it, Mr Archer?<eos> It was in the early edition.<eos> Detective Bob Sheenan.<eos> You like 'em soft, don't you, Mr Archer?<eos> I put one in as soon as I heard you on the stairs.
Does that mean you would or wouldn't like to see the Houses of Parliament?<eos> It means, my dear Superintendent, that I do not have the slightest intention of spending the evening watching a roomful of army officers and their overdressed women guzzling champagne and, between mouthfuls of smoked salmon, telling me the best place to buy Staffordshire china.<eos> Very well, then, I'll take you to your accommodation on Brook Street.<eos> You will take me to my office.<eos> And then you will requisition a car for your permanent use.
You sent the files to the Feldgendarmerie straightaway.<eos> And within the hour, the SS claimed them back and a teleprinter message from Berlin instructed the army to pass all papers back to you.<eos> But that instruction could've only come from the Supreme Commander.<eos> Heil Hitler.<eos> Of course, you speak excellent German.
Of course, you speak excellent German.<eos> You took modern languages at Oxford. Pembroke.<eos> I was at King's College.<eos> Happy times there.<eos> How long did you resist working for us?
You got Sir John Shields to perform the autopsy.<eos> He's the top pathologist in the country.<eos> Physician to His Majesty.<eos> - If you have a strong suspicion of what Peter Thomas was suffering from, I ought to be told.<eos> Have you seen anything like this before?
This is an army establishment... it's nothing to do with the Civil Police or the SS.<eos> But I'm investigating a murder.<eos> The British Army always allowed the Civil Police...<eos> I'm not interested in ancient history.<eos> This camp, it's under German Army jurisdiction, and you have no powers here.
Herr Archer... there's no need for this.<eos> These walls are secure.<eos> Much safer to arrest your man here.<eos> I will make an exception.<eos> You must be hungry.
I will be the one to take him into custody.<eos> Come on, Superintendent.<eos> You'll have scared him away.<eos> But we'll have a thorough check all the same.<eos> We are here to help... not shoot him, if that's what you fear.
You're particularly welcome, Superintendent.<eos> Quite a melange tonight.<eos> Everyone here except the Prime Minister.<eos> I've seen this before.<eos> What a memory you have.
Well, you mustn't believe everything you read about policeman and their feet.<eos> I used to dance quite a lot at one time.<eos> I heard about your wife, Superintendent.<eos> That's a terrible thing.<eos> And you have a little boy too.
Not being recognised is part of my job.<eos> So what happened to the football player in Wisconsin?<eos> I married him.<eos> Any progress on that murder case?<eos> But what the hell, you didn't ask me to dance to talk about murder cases, did you?
Not exactly.<eos> Yes, they can only be tried in their own court, but the same is true of the German armed forces.<eos> The SS can't touch them.<eos> Come along, we're playing cards.<eos> I'm glad that you confirm that.
So I heard.<eos> But no-one on this side of the Atlantic really knows anything about it.<eos> That's less important than shoring Connolly up for now. His position in Washington is tenuous.<eos> It's dicey. The Germans might take over our Embassy, and that would be a bad blow for Connolly's prestige over there.<eos> So you're in touch with him?
Don't be such an English stuffed shirt!<eos> So you were 18 when you saw your first war?<eos> What did your father say?<eos> He owned the newspaper.<eos> And you... You went into the police force?
Yes.<eos> Come on. I'm going to give you a lesson you will never forget.<eos> Just wait. You will see what your friends are like.<eos> This is the area where I used to live.<eos> Why are you bringing me here?
This was my home.<eos> Jimmy!<eos> "I was an English hunting dog, working for the German huntsmen."<eos> The gallant British patriots.<eos> Are you proud of them?
Don't try and play both ends against the middle.<eos> Just remember, the axe never mourns the tree it fells.<eos> Are you all right, Mr. Archer?<eos> Go to bed.<eos> Is it your wife you're thinking of?
There he is, with that buffoon, Sturmbannfuhrer Strauss.<eos> Harry.<eos> Superintendent.<eos> You've been a fool, Sergeant Woods.<eos> If you say so.
- There is one scene, and one scene only, where two of the puppets simulate sex.<eos> There's no nudity.<eos> Yeah, well, naked puppets don't bother me.<eos> Fucking puppets, on the other hand, well, it's vulgar.<eos> Even if it were, you'd still have to prove that it has no legal, artistic, or literary value.
Having a vision doesn't mean you know what that vision means.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What's this on your hand?<eos> Why did you put this mark on your hand?<eos> What do you mean?
Good news, we're letting you out early.<eos> Bad news, your wife's dead.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's our policy. I can't change your ticket from two days from now till today.<eos> If you have to change your departure date from Friday to today, it's a $200 change fee plus the difference in fare.
I'm sorry.<eos> It's our policy. I can't change your ticket from two days from now till today.<eos> If you have to change your departure date from Friday to today, it's a $200 change fee plus the difference in fare.<eos> - $200. - Plus the difference in fare.<eos> Do you have to travel today?
I... Look, th-there's... th-there's my name.<eos> I got to get back.<eos> He was only born two days ago.<eos> We... We named him... We...<eos> Sir, are you sure you're supposed to be traveling alone?
Thank you. Yeah, you're gonna go right in first class. Okay?<eos> - Don't worry anymore. - Thank you. - And mind your bag.<eos> - Watch your step. - Thank you. Thank you.<eos> Next. So sorry.<eos> Can you take your seat?
Great.<eos> I slept through first class.<eos> Sorry we had to make an emergency landing.<eos> Can't blame us for the weather.<eos> I can get you on a flight tomorrow that'll get you into Eagle Point by 6.
Four Mississippi.<eos> 911. What's your emergency?<eos> I'm at the Armitage house.<eos> My name is Chris.<eos> I'm sorry, sir, can you repeat that?
When you see a train leave the station... do you need to know where it's going to understand that you saw it leave?<eos> It's a tough pill to swallow.<eos> At one point, so was the Earth being round.<eos> But, Dr. Harber, why did it take you six months to address us?<eos> Where have you been?
They just got me running rampant here.<eos> I'm doing the job of five people.<eos> Off-season cutbacks and whatnot? Yeah.<eos> Can I give you a description... of Billy?<eos> That way if he does... come in, you can keep an eye out for him.
Like a real, like, pouty-type face.<eos> And then, um... he's got a birthmark on, uh...<eos> Let's see.<eos> On his right elbow.<eos> You're not writing any of this down.
- Accurate.<eos> I would love to see that list.<eos> I'm sure you would.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Are you looking for something?
I would love to see that list.<eos> I'm sure you would.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Are you looking for something?<eos> Maybe you can help me. Um...
And how many students is each counselor...<eos> All right. Have her come to my office.<eos> They pantsed me in the middle of the hallway.<eos> I don't know what that means.<eos> They pantsed you? How could you not know what that means?
Okay, well, maybe we should be.<eos> You should be blaming the kids that make this school a terrible place.<eos> You should be blaming the kids that make other kids want to kill themselves.<eos> Are you referring to Hannah Baker?<eos> What do you think?
You should be blaming the kids that make other kids want to kill themselves.<eos> Are you referring to Hannah Baker?<eos> What do you think?<eos> Do you want to talk about Hannah?<eos> Do you?
Maybe like a state school.<eos> You never met with Hannah?<eos> Once, in the spring of her sophomore year last year.<eos> We start the sophomores thinking of college.<eos> And do you recall what she was thinking of college?
- Yeah, I thought it was well-written.<eos> So you didn't actually find it on campus.<eos> Isn't that the whole conceit of the magazine?<eos> Sometimes I get submissions anonymously.<eos> Why are you asking me about this?
It's for safety.<eos> They're tarot cards.<eos> Want me to read your fortune?<eos> CHILDS: Okay, Mr. Jensen.<eos> You want to protest your civil rights?
Can you tell me who this is in this photo?<eos> It's hard to tell.<eos> That's not you in this photo?<eos> I thought we were here to talk about Hannah.<eos> I'm not sure what you're trying to pin on my daughter...
Not... a problem.<eos> Really?<eos> Well, how are you a problem to them?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You can get that if you want.
What if we could?<eos> What if we knew what we did wrong?<eos> I don't think Clay Jensen hates you.<eos> I don't know him all that well, but he doesn't seem the type to hate anyone.<eos> It's like it doesn't even matter what you say.
I think we should blame ourselves.<eos> I think we all could do better.<eos> We can try to love each other better, but we're imperfect people.<eos> We love imperfectly. We don't always get it right.<eos> How can you just live with that? I mean, you're a counselor.
Look, even if she did come to visit me... this is not something I can talk about.<eos> So, if I tell you that I'm going to kill myself, you can't tell anyone?<eos> Yes, I can tell your parents.<eos> You know, I can tell who I need to tell in order to get you the right medical attention.<eos> Did you tell anyone about Hannah?
Maybe you made a decision?<eos> No, I...<eos> A decision to do something with a boy that now you regret.<eos> Oh, my God, no!<eos> That's just what you assume?
You mean... do nothing.<eos> Is he in your class?<eos> He's a senior.<eos> That means he'll be gone in a few months.<eos> Are you fucking kidding me?
I asked him for it.<eos> I took Hannah at her word, which is what you should have done.<eos> I believed Hannah, and I accused Bryce of rape, and then he beat the shit out of me and admitted it.<eos> I think maybe now is where we stop this conversation. - Okay.<eos> But wouldn't you like to know what happened after Hannah left that day?
Look, you're right.<eos> Hey, Hannah, you can sit down.<eos> You don't need to be in a hurry.<eos> I need to get on with things. If things aren't going to change, I'd better get on with it.<eos> She walked out of this office... and she hoped you would come after her.
- Call 9-1-1. Call 9-1-1!<eos> - Oh, God. Don't touch me, just call 9-1-1.<eos> Tell them to hurry!<eos> Tell them to hurry!<eos> And you could have stopped it.
There's no way to know why she did what she did.<eos> Actually, there is a way.<eos> Before she died... Hannah recorded 13 reasons why she killed herself.<eos> And you're number 13.<eos> And everyone who comes before you on these tapes knows what you did and didn't do.
And everyone who comes before you on these tapes knows what you did and didn't do.<eos> And they always will.<eos> And they'll know what they did.<eos> You're the last person to get the tapes.<eos> Hannah didn't leave any instructions on what happens after you... so you get to decide.
No, I don't.<eos> I come from Nassau.<eos> My name is Tom Morgan.<eos> I come on behalf of Long John Silver.<eos> Have you heard of him?
Got you.<eos> No, that's not me. You sure?<eos> Absolutely positive.<eos> OK.<eos> So the email I sent you. Do you recognise that signature?
That way, you can enter the property and make sure that everything looks good, it's nice and tidy, there's no tenant fucking jerking off on the couch.<eos> - That's common sense, okay?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> Right? I mean, it's just... it's a little foresight, that's all.<eos> I completely understand what you're saying.
I'm so sorry, man.<eos> I'm in a hurry today.<eos> But, you know, it seems like a good cause, man.<eos> - Good luck, dude.<eos> - You're not interested in helping a child learn to read?
You keep it.<eos> Keep it?<eos> I apologize, I didn't catch your name.<eos> I'm VM Vargas.<eos> And you work for...
I've been calling all day.<eos> But I'll try again tomorrow.<eos> Maybe the minister will have time to speak in the morning.<eos> She is not up there.<eos> And who, may I ask, are you?
You're early.<eos> Hi.<eos> Cybercrime division, Oslo.<eos> Two stoners and a dog.<eos> - Are you there?
What about the abdomen, generally?<eos> Never better. Generally.<eos> Nausea, vomiting?<eos> I wish.<eos> Where've you been for the last nine weeks, Sheriff?
- It's the governor's banner.<eos> - Do we pursue?<eos> Set a course to overtake her.<eos> Captain?<eos> I would've thought you'd retired by now.
I would've thought you'd retired by now.<eos> Bulletins... from my scouts in the field tonight.<eos> I was contemplating my response after the sunrise.<eos> Anything we should discuss?<eos> You have enough on your mind.
Fuck.<eos> - What did he say?<eos> - Nothing helpful.<eos> What's going on?<eos> You're about to make a terrible mistake and I am asking you to reconsider.
So, if you know of any friends Ennis may have had, or...<eos> He didn't talk much.<eos> Except to curse.<eos> I think he may have changed his name before he moved here.<eos> Did you ever hear of Thaddeus Mobley out of Los Angeles?
I know he wasn't from around here.<eos> It's kind of, to be honest, a mystery.<eos> Ennis moved to Eden Valley in 1980.<eos> But I think he may have changed his name before he moved here.<eos> Did you ever hear of Thaddeus Mobley out of Los Angeles?
One cube.<eos> And, uh, whatever this big swinging dick over here is drinking.<eos> Oh, no, that's... I just wanted a cream soda.<eos> I'm not much of a drinker, in point of fact.<eos> Well, maybe that's why you are the award-winning writer.
Saving some of those brain cells for the page.<eos> How about a nice cream soda for my new amigo Thaddeus over here?<eos> Do you prefer "Thaddeus", or, uh... Uh, Tad.<eos> Thanks.<eos> But how'd you know my name?
Producer.<eos> So, let me ask you, you ever think about turning that... That book of yours into a movie?<eos> "The Planet Wyh."<eos> Bob Redford is the robot.<eos> Hold the phone. You're saying you wanna turn my book into a movie?
Have a seat, Ray.<eos> --I, uh...<eos> You know the Deputy Director.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> How are you today, sir?
Well, you know what they say about time being money.<eos> - Really? - Mmm.<eos> I don't want to talk business in front of them.<eos> Emmit, don't be rude.<eos> I don't mean to gossip, but, um, are you English by any chance?
So, the IRS?<eos> Leave the IRS to me.<eos> Section 41C of the US tax code affords my client the right to licensed representation in the face of any IRS inquiry.<eos> As counsel, I'm filing here with you an official protest to this baseless and cockeyed inquiry, and demand you withdraw immediately and file by mail the statutory-required 30-day notice listing the exact documents you require and personnel you wish to interview.<eos> Until that time, we demand you vacate our offices.
- My team? - Yes, sir.<eos> And we thought it curious the house being targeted and searched as it was that he shared the same last name as you and your brother.<eos> The same first initial. Lived in towns with similar names.<eos> What are they...<eos> Is there some kind of feud between you and Ray?
All named Stussy.<eos> You see, in 1932 there were, what, 24 Hitlers in a German phone book.<eos> Now, are you suggesting that they were all responsible for the Final Solution?<eos> Twenty-four, exactly?<eos> Sir, was there some kind of disagreement over money between you and your brother?
Don't.<eos> Jesus.<eos> Ray.<eos> Mr. Stussy.<eos> Do you know what Lenin said about Beethoven's Piano Sonata Number 23?
He said, "I know nothing that is greater than the Appassionata,<eos> but I cannot listen too often.<eos> It affects one's nerves, and makes one want to say kind, stupid things, and stroke the heads of those who, living in such a foul hell, can create such beauty.<eos> Better to beat the person unmercifully over the head."<eos> Where are you, Mr. Stussy?
I already spoke to your boss. Both of you.<eos> - This is harassment.<eos> - We're on our lunch break.<eos> Heard it was shepherd's pie day in the cafeteria.<eos> And here you are.
Madeline!<eos> Jeez! We've got the intercom.<eos> What the shit is this?<eos> It's... I don't know.<eos> Saw 'em when I came in this morning. - Thought maybe you redecorated...
- What?<eos> - Residue. To make sure you haven't been, you know, building a bomb.<eos> What are we talking about here? Nobody's been building any...<eos> No, of course not.<eos> That's what I'm saying. But because of your withdrawal, which I am required by law to question, you've been selected for additional review.
This is deputy Gloria burgle, meeker county sheriff's office, with an interview of emmit stussy, march 16, 2011.<eos> First up, I'm curious about something. Your house is an hour's drive from here.<eos> There's three St. cloud metros near your office.<eos> You gave me your card. Okay, then.<eos> Well, i got a lot of questions, but I guess, maybe, you should just start.
So, I go to him and, "enough's enough," I said.<eos> "This dumb feud, let's put it in the past."<eos> And I give him the frame, but he's still mad and he tries to give it back, so we start shoving and the frame breaks.<eos> And a piece of glass, stuck in his neck.<eos> You hit him with it? No, I didn't...
I never sent anything to...<eos> Well, it has your name on it.<eos> Look, this is my last day, so...<eos> Are you working a case involving Emmit Stussy or Stussy Lots Ltd.?<eos> How did you get this number?
Give Mr. Stussy some room.<eos> He's earned the right to be testy.<eos> After everything he's been through.<eos> I'm done. Give me back my papers and get out!<eos> Are you a fan of progress, Mr. Stussy?
He's been here overnight.<eos> That this was my salvation. A weary traveler, I.<eos> Agent Burgle, Department of Homeland Security.<eos> The nation state defending its borders. And me, a simple salesman.<eos> - What do you sell, Mr... - Rand.
In Brussels. Is that where you live?<eos> Good lord, no.<eos> I'm a citizen of the air, madam.<eos> Moving, always moving.<eos> You don't remember me, do you?
Moving, always moving.<eos> You don't remember me, do you?<eos> Surmise.<eos> Because I haven't greeted you, I don't remember you.<eos> Do you?
One's eyes can be deceived. We see what we believe, not the other way around.<eos> Six people dead, including a state trooper.<eos> $200 million unaccounted for.<eos> Those are facts.<eos> And you at the heart of the morass.
What else am I supposed to see?<eos> A man wakes up one morning and decides to kill four men over a certain age, all with the same last name.<eos> That didn't happen.<eos> And yet, if evidence is collected, if confessions are made, if a verdict of guilty is entered in a court of law, then its happening becomes as the rocks and rivers, and to argue that it didn't happen is to argue with reality itself.<eos> Did you know Emmit Stussy was murdered? Three months ago. Killed in his own home.
Excuse?<eos> Mr. Blanding.<eos> He won't be coming back today.<eos> Can I make an appointment for tomorrow?<eos> You have to telephone.
Can I make an appointment for tomorrow?<eos> You have to telephone.<eos> Appointments only by telephone.<eos> I see.<eos> Why are you smiling?
Do you know whatever happened to P.J.'s software?<eos> No.<eos> Don't you think you should?<eos> I'm not that great at parties, either.<eos> So you're, what, a wallflower billionaire?
Sir.<eos> Citizen filed a complaint this morning.<eos> Pretty serious.<eos> It says a cop confiscated her phone unlawfully, and never returned it.<eos> She describes a Mexican male with a mustache, and you were the only officer on the scene that fits that description.
Thank you.<eos> Sir. Sir!<eos> I'm sorry to... sorry to interrupt.<eos> - Yeah, can I help you?<eos> - I think you can.
I don't mean to step on other people.<eos> But if I can't get you to figure out what's wrong with me, I end up in an asylum.<eos> Or prison.<eos> You look for special cases, right?<eos> I read an article where you said that.
I'm having visions.<eos> My son... he... he's dead.<eos> He's talkin' to me.<eos> I can't even write with his pen.<eos> I mean, how can you explain something like that?
Clear. And sharp.<eos> Nice job.<eos> Nice job.<eos> You have the right to remain silent.<eos> Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
Stole that man's watch right there.<eos> Why don't you go talk with him?
James Bagwell.<eos> Remember me?<eos> Shit.<eos> Aah! Wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> What... Stop. What are you doing?
Remember me?<eos> Shit.<eos> Aah! Wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> What... Stop. What are you doing?<eos> - You can't come in here.
Yeah.<eos> I'm looking for Marius Josepovitch.<eos> You mean Josepovich?<eos> Good. You do know him.<eos> W-who are you?
I'll be in in five minutes.<eos> Sadavir: They'remobilizingforwar .<eos> Martian ships are moving throughout the system.<eos> The morrigan to titan. The africanus to callisto. And the scirocco to Phoebe.<eos> What are you recommending?
- Your Honor. - This is bad faith.<eos> And it's bad faith for them to now restrict access to that informant when the entire material support charge hinges on my client's discussions with him.<eos> Was that money for airline tickets, like my client says, or was it bound for jihadis in Nigeria, as the informant seems to claim?<eos> This court deserves to know.<eos> What are you asking for, exactly?
I call it a start.<eos> Come on. We got to bring up the offer with Sekou.<eos> Sir, do you know where you are?<eos> On the floor.<eos> I understand you'd rather not go to the hospital.
Doc can run an EEG.<eos> Sir? Max will take care of me.<eos> I understand he's your business manager.<eos> No. He's my babysitter.<eos> Okay. I don't like it, but if you want, I can release you AMA...
Why?<eos> Gonzalez?<eos> That woman who just went in... she got here two hours after you put my name on the list.<eos> So tell your friend, next time, limit himself to misdemeanors.<eos> You said you'd check on him?
- Guard! - I am on your side.<eos> Get away from me!<eos> - Guard! - Quinn.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Are you here for a job interview?
The one parked right out there, actually, the blue Jeep.<eos> I need to speak to the driver.<eos> I'll have to check with Accounting.<eos> I think they might all be at lunch.<eos> If you want to wait over there?
Yeah. A blue Jeep registered to this address.<eos> - I think you've made a mistake.<eos> - I think I haven't.<eos> What organization is this?<eos> A private one, and you're trespassing.
What organization is this?<eos> A private one, and you're trespassing.<eos> What's your position here?<eos> Could I have your name?<eos> You wouldn't have lied your way in if you had any legal authority, like a warrant.
Sir, is she home?<eos> No.<eos> Carrie Mathison of The Fair Trial Project?<eos> I said no.<eos> What can you tell us about the suicide bomber Sekou Bah?
She's not here!<eos> May I ask your name?<eos> Do you live here?<eos> You don't live here?<eos> Sir? Are you acquainted with the bomber Sekou Bah?
Still undisclosed.<eos> General, you were in the Pentagon on 9/11.<eos> That's right.<eos> You had a plane come right through your office window.<eos> Where did you run to?
You folks okay?<eos> Hey, can I ride get a ride into town?<eos> Yeah, hop in.<eos> - Whoa, sir, trust me. - Hey!<eos> You don't want to do this.
Franny will remain in foster care until more information is provided at further proceedings.<eos> - No! - This session is adjourned.<eos> I'm gonna talk to her.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Sure you have the right seat?
- A one-year gap on his résumé.<eos> How did he explain it?<eos> He won't.<eos> Then why are we even having this discussion?<eos> Because this is the résumé you singled out as near perfect.
Fuck.<eos> Find and secure her. Do you copy?<eos> Copy that.<eos> Clear.<eos> Sir, I thought you might want to see this.
I also understand you've been working for the CIA. I have not.<eos> Saul and I sometimes speak when it's mutually beneficial.<eos> Well, I need some straight talk now.<eos> That's why I'm here.<eos> As far as you know, is there a concerted effort to get me to withdraw my support for the nuclear agreement?
We still have the van.<eos> Show me.<eos> Incredible.<eos> There's a photo of Sekou with his mom and sister on the visor.<eos> It's what you've been asking for-- an actual prosecutable case.
Frasier.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Terrorism?<eos> It was the French.<eos> Yes, you said that already.
- Mr. President, it appears Ukrainian separatists have taken control of an armed nuclear submarine, and they'll have launch capability within two hours.<eos> You're being brought to a bunker, which you will access with your unique biometrics once inside.<eos> - Sorry, my unique biometrics?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> The door can only be unlocked by you and you alone unless you have an identical twin brother, which would be ridiculous.
They won't fire on us.<eos> I beg your pardon, sir, but we're at war.<eos> Why wouldn't they?<eos> The most recognizable British governor in the New World is attempting to sail a man-of-war requesting parley into the port of Havana.<eos> If you were them, wouldn't you want to know why?
I hear you fine.<eos> But if you want your men alive, you stay out!<eos> Nobody's doing anything.<eos> Let's just keep talking, okay?<eos> Tell me what you want.
Sir, I understand why you benched me. But with everything that's happened, can't you restore my clearance?<eos> Please, I can help.<eos> You can help by archiving those servers.<eos> This is Andy.<eos> Mr. Shalowitz, are you the owner of a blue teal Ford?
Now.<eos> Senator, we are dealing with a major terrorist threat right now...<eos> I serve in the senate, but I am a candidate for the president of the United States.<eos> I can have the attorney general here in 20 minutes.<eos> Do you want to have this conversation with him?
Sir, Senator Donovan is on the phone.<eos> I need the room.<eos> Senator.<eos> Hello, Don.<eos> I can't tell you how relieved I am to know that you're safe.
Here comes Pang. Hope you all know what you're doing.<eos> About to find out.<eos> Yes, Senator, you've been expected.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm sorry, sir, could you try that again, please?
I'm sorry to disturb you, but Director Simms was found dead in his office earlier this morning.<eos> Dead?<eos> I understand you were with him last night.<eos> I was.<eos> Why were you there?
- Leave now, please.<eos> - I'd be careful if I were you.<eos> - Mr. Rawls, get out of this room.<eos> - Mrs. Hudson!<eos> You don't want to hear what he's about to tell you.
- Mr. Rawls, get out of this room.<eos> - Mrs. Hudson!<eos> You don't want to hear what he's about to tell you.<eos> Not like this.<eos> You don't want to hear about it this way.
Evidently, that is the lifespan of "the governor is on his way" as a viable measure of delay.<eos> The solution to our problems is not going to come from a council meeting.<eos> They are losing faith in you.<eos> They see the problems we face in rebuilding this colony, the dangers if we fail.<eos> And they are growing more and more skeptical by the day that you have anything in the way of a solution.
The threat will not...<eos> The defense of civilization is not your responsibility, sir!<eos> Your duty is to restore stable profits to Nassau.<eos> And the men charged to follow you to that end are already questioning their trust in you.<eos> If they see pirates return here, if they see skirmishes begin again on this island and they know that it was because you invited it... then you are going to have a mutiny on your hands, sir.
What he's asking for is unacceptable.<eos> - What's that?<eos> - Sir, it would be a critical mistake.<eos> I am the only advantage in this situation.<eos> From my position, Mr. Gibbons, you've exaggerated your value.
- It's a beautiful day, Mrs. Rasal.<eos> - It is, Mr. Bhoopalam.<eos> Mrs. Rasal.<eos> Hello.<eos> Who are you?
I know your face.<eos> Raoul found your movies...<eos> Cheesy?<eos> No.<eos> You underestimate yourself.
Well, let's just say... you are my son's type.<eos> Señor Pasquale...<eos> Can I ask about his disappearance?<eos> I know he went to Chicago for a story.<eos> Do you know anything about it?
Since he disappeared, I haven't been able to come in here.<eos> These are his photographs.<eos> That's the cabin.<eos> We need to know where these pictures were taken.<eos> Do you know where these pictures were taken?
You're a reporter.<eos> You must have watched this.<eos> Of course.<eos> But I don't understand what it means.<eos> Maybe you can explain it to me.
I showed him a picture of my son and he denied ever meeting him.<eos> What did your journalistic intuition tell you about him?<eos> He's a lying snake who would open his own mother's throat if he could profit by it.<eos> When was the last time he spoke to Raoul?<eos> When was the last time you spoke to Raoul?
Mun. From Seoul Metropolitan Police.<eos> I was hoping to talk to you about Sun Bak.<eos> Hope is undiscovered disappointment.<eos> I hope to keep her alive.<eos> Do you?
I hope to keep her alive.<eos> Do you?<eos> - Come on.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> You, uh...
- Come on.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> You, uh...<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> You know her well, don't you?

I hope to keep her alive.<eos> Do you?<eos> - Come on.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> You, uh...
- Come on.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> You, uh...<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> You know her well, don't you?
Oliver Dake.<eos> Are we square now?<eos> Don't serve rabbit food to an elephant and ask if he's full.<eos> Sir.<eos> Would you get these fine young barristers another round?
We won't go! We won't go! We won't go!<eos> - All right, that's enough!<eos> - We won't go! - We won't go!<eos> We won't go! - Hey! - Hey!<eos> - Hey! - What are you doing?
If you don't mind...<eos> -Of course.<eos> Mr. President.<eos> I'll be right along.<eos> It's a busy day for you today, sir.
I know the Underwoods.<eos> The only way that we are gonna survive this... is if they win.<eos> You can help them win.<eos> I know you can.<eos> I got on the paper right around the time you left.
Then what would you say?<eos> I think you and I got off on the wrong foot here.<eos> I am gonna go ahead and call my own number on that one.<eos> I got sent to a department mandated shrink for a while, said I broadcast hostility.<eos> I hear you were a Marine. Nope.
Law enforcement?<eos> No, that's where I'm gonna have to disagree with you.<eos> How's that?<eos> I know not here to enforce, brother. I'm here to empower.<eos> You are gonna empower these shit-stain ex-cons to do what exactly?
You have questions for Mr. Josepovich?<eos> Write them down, I'll make sure he gets them.<eos> Anything other than that, come back with a warrant.<eos> You gotta be fucking kidding.<eos> You meditate?
- How do you do?<eos> Pleased to meet you.<eos> And Detective Constable Morse.<eos> Pleased to meet you.<eos> Do you speak Russian?
All bar you and Inspector Thursday's daughter.<eos> The bank couldn't tell me when she'll be in.<eos> She's gone away, I believe, to recuperate.<eos> You all right?<eos> You don't look as though you've been sleeping.
Sometimes, even by accident.<eos> You have to catch the person who killed Richard Nielsen.<eos> His last letter he sent, he said there were problems within his group.<eos> What kind of problems?<eos> He didn't say, but you should know our opinions were simpatico upon certain important matters.
For how long?<eos> A couple of weeks, maybe a month.<eos> Such gallantry.<eos> And when did you really last see her?<eos> Shortly after you left, she dropped by... briefly.
A couple of weeks, maybe a month.<eos> Such gallantry.<eos> And when did you really last see her?<eos> Shortly after you left, she dropped by... briefly.<eos> Where were you the night before the chess tournament?
Damage to the upper and lower maxilla.<eos> Extensive third-degree burns.<eos> Could you tell us about your father's relationship to Dr Leighton-Asbury?<eos> Yes, Dad was a patient, for the best part of ten years.<eos> Did you ever go with him, out to Binsey?
That's awful.<eos> But... if you think Dr Leighton-Asbury's got anything to do with it, you're way off-beam.<eos> - How's that?<eos> - Well, I'm a scientist. I don't go in for God. But that man was a miracle worker.<eos> Where were you last night? For the record.
Penelope's dead.<eos> Your sister, she's dead.<eos> I just found her again!<eos> After all that time, I can't let it happen again!<eos> You're ill.
After all that time, I can't let it happen again!<eos> You're ill.<eos> You've had a breakdown, and Dr Neilsen knew it.<eos> He was going to tell Dr Amory, have you taken off the project.<eos> - That's why you killed him. - I had to.
No, I'm not mad.<eos> God knows I should be, growing up here.<eos> It was a house of monsters.<eos> But the men who came to visit your father were heroes, as was he.<eos> The only monster in that house was you.
I read your sister's diary.<eos> - She was terrified of you.<eos> - I'd never hurt Penelope!<eos> The only way to get away ofyou was by drowning! She drowned herself to get away from you.<eos> - You forced her to it.
Try to stay calm, Mr. Lawes.<eos> The bad guys missed you.<eos> We're here to help.<eos> Our bosses are very interested in a bunch of VIPs that went missing last night.<eos> You were one of them.
Ran.<eos> Oh, you got a problem with how I do shit, pretty boy?<eos> Taystee?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm telling the real story, 'cause you sure the hell didn't.
Jesus Christ!<eos> Are you insane?<eos> No, she's angry.<eos> We're all angry.<eos> You done our girl wrong, Mr. Caputo, and you gonna fix it.
- We in charge now. - Mmm-hmm.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> He don't know.<eos> Why you think the alarm was going off, and the lights and everything?
Multiple injuries.<eos> Copy that, Beacon Hills.<eos> Medical is en route.<eos> Laceration, room 4A.<eos> Excuse me, sir. If you wanna be treated, you have to sign in first.
Uh, did my brother Norman check you in here?<eos> He's, uh, in his early 20s, dark brown hair, and really polite.<eos> Yeah, why?<eos> You need to leave.<eos> What are you talking about?
Welcome to the Kings Motel.<eos> What brings you to town?<eos> - I'm just visiting my sister.<eos> - Of course.<eos> Uh, which credit card will you be using today?
All right.<eos> Who's your sister?<eos> Norma Bates.<eos> What?<eos> Um, when was the last time you talked to her?
Why?<eos> Right, um...<eos> Uh, I hate to be the one to tell you this, but your sister... she, uh... she passed away.<eos> It was a terrible tragedy.<eos> What are you talking about?
He wanted to do some shopping, so we sent him over to 5th Avenue.<eos> 5th Avenue?<eos> Right, and where is that?<eos> You'll never find him.<eos> Why don't you wait for him at the hotel bar?
She was just here.<eos> John took her.<eos> You mean the Ripper took her.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> Because you told me.
How do you know that?<eos> Because you told me.<eos> I'll explain everything, but we need to go now.<eos> II don't know you!<eos> But you will.
How can I possibly be related to you?<eos> I've never met you before in my life.<eos> But I've met you in my life.<eos> That's impossible.<eos> So is time travel, but here you are.
Is it the key?<eos> How do you know about the key?<eos> Please.<eos> They're gone.<eos> Come with me and I will help you find them.
No, not if he wants the key.<eos> How do you know me?<eos> You said that we were related.<eos> How is that possible?<eos> I was hoping you might have some answers.
I was hoping you might have some answers.<eos> I've traced my genealogy, but I can't find a genetic connection.<eos> You said that we've met before.<eos> My freshman year in college, I was walking on campus.<eos> You came running up to me, out of breath, in a hurry, and said that you were H.G. Wells.
My dad is taking such good care of them, they had no idea I was missing, which is a good thing.<eos> Right, uh, well, Booth, Dr. Brennan, this is Dr. Roshan.<eos> He is the head of the facility where Zack was institutionalized.<eos> Dr. Roshan, thank you so much for being here.<eos> Do you have any idea how Zack managed to escape?
My key broke in the lock!<eos> It's the red one! It was my bike!<eos> Hey, hey, hey, hey! Here it is!<eos> I didn't see that key.<eos> You didn't ask!
James, on the other hand, was a gentleman.<eos> He was kind and a good man. A surprise.<eos> Someone that I could see myself spending the rest of my days with.<eos> Mr. Tucker. Hmm?<eos> Where were you the night before last?
Right, well, Booth, now that we've verified the alibi, we should get going.<eos> It was an honor to meet you, sir.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey, Bones, hold-- one more thing.<eos> You know, I may need another set of eyes and ears on the property while I'm gone, in case you see anything.

Tree. Like, a tree, 'cause it's a log.<eos> It comes from a tree.<eos> It's a play on words.<eos> Every person I see is carrying at least six lethal implements.<eos> Excuse me. Are you in charge here?
You need to get to the hospital.<eos> Which one of you is Agent Spaulding?<eos> That would be me, ma'am.<eos> How can I help you?<eos> Do you see those doors, Agent Spaulding?
No, this isn't a high-level operation.<eos> It's the high-level operation.<eos> No, this isn't your team, it's mine.<eos> No, you are not in charge.<eos> You were in charge.
No, this isn't your team, it's mine.<eos> No, you are not in charge.<eos> You were in charge.<eos> I am in charge now.<eos> If you have questions or concerns,
Or it could be Mellie or Jake or me or the marine standing in the hall out there.<eos> The fact is, it could be almost anyone who meets the basic qualifications to be President, because, legally...<eos> And there are very few limits on what the electoral college can do and very little precedent to indicate what it might do in a situation like this...<eos> Legally, the next Presidency is wide open.<eos> But practically, I think it makes an enormous difference what you do.

There's only one way to find out.<eos> _<eos> Theodore Bagwell.<eos> And you're Dr. Whitcombe, the man who invited me to this mystery meeting at 9:30 at night when the rest of the building's closed.<eos> I know what you've done.
But as with any cutting-edge work, funding is not easy to find, and yet, incredibly, I got the grant in the form of a considerable anonymous grant on one condition... the first recipient of my procedure... is you.<eos> I can equip you with a fully articulate prosthetic, operationally indistinguishable from a real hand.<eos> All of this because of an anonymous donor?<eos> Someone seems to have plans for both of us.<eos> I've reserved an operational lab for Monday if you decide you are interested.
Michael has never been anyone's sucker.<eos> He's always been in control. Always.<eos> You saying he faked his own death?<eos> I'm saying you need to look at all of the possibilities before you walk into a war zone.<eos> I wasn't sure you'd come.
It's mandatory for a procedure like this.<eos> You'll forgive me if I have a problem lying unconscious before a man with sharp items at his disposal.<eos> It cannot be done without a general anesthetic.<eos> Oh, I've done it before, friend.<eos> And look what it got you.
You're free to go.<eos> Not till you tell me what you've put in me.<eos> You feel an unease, do you?<eos> I'd venture that's what's always been in you since birth.<eos> Your soul. I just put the hardware into you. You're the thing that runs it.
We are.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Hi... sorry.<eos> I just noticed you were coming out of Ezra Fitz's loft.<eos> I'm sorry, who are you?
You better think twice about why you came back to town, Jenna.<eos> The cops are already punching holes in that little bedtime story about you and Noel.<eos> Well, they shouldn't.<eos> Because the last time I checked, the only person who could contradict that story was dead.<eos> Mr. Tenerelli, are you here?

Really?<eos> Well that system failed on Thursday between 9:14 and 9:24.<eos> Besides you who else has access?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You'd have to speak to Ashley Marin.
Yeah.<eos> Have you discussed which one of you would, like to carry the child?<eos> - She will.<eos> - Molly.<eos> Well, we were actually hoping that you would help us make that choice, Dr. Hammond.
I doubt this is the most personal piece of mail he gets.<eos> We're gonna do some digging.<eos> Look, lady, I don't mind calling you a tow truck but I don't have any shovels.<eos> How is that possible?<eos> I mean, how do you plant a tree without a shovel?
Once we saw your e-mail, we interrogated him.<eos> He's fully disclosed 21-Void's conspiracy to frame you for the murder of Harlan Gaines and bury your identity by giving you a new one: Kaniel Outis.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> It means... you're free to go, Mr. Scofield.<eos> You don't know how long I've waited to hear someone call me that.
Talk about grand gestures.<eos> "Unreciprocated," she said.<eos> You didn't get that down.<eos> Only because I can't spell it.<eos> So, while this gun battle is going on, you're sitting outside in the car.
Somebody tell me why we're here!<eos> Because we're alive.<eos> Very good.<eos> Here you go. You're shaking like a chihuahua.<eos> I know what you're trying to do.
What's going on with you?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Lobo tells me you're about a day away from getting the tube.<eos> You've been making progress, but you can't stay at Threshold if you drop any more weight.<eos> I just think it's so weird that you know everything about me... and I don't know anything about you.
Lobo tells me you're about a day away from getting the tube.<eos> You've been making progress, but you can't stay at Threshold if you drop any more weight.<eos> I just think it's so weird that you know everything about me... and I don't know anything about you.<eos> Okay, what do you wanna know?<eos> - Do you have a wife?
It's gonna be so lame without music.<eos> And you're totally a big deal.<eos> How cool will we look to Simone with DJ TK at the turn tables?<eos> - Fine. Okay. - Yay!<eos> Dr. Barminski, do you have a sec?
Forearms could indicate narcotics.<eos> - Where was the site?<eos> - On his deltoid, up here.<eos> Is your friend an athlete?<eos> How'd you know that?
- Yes.<eos> And you said...<eos> I didn't want to say in front of Ryan.<eos> You were seen rowing with a young woman who is now dead, and you lied about it.<eos> Now, can you see why I have a problem with that?
- The entire time? - The entire time.<eos> So why does your wife say you spent time alone at the memorial and she was back home in Newcastle overnight?<eos> Mr Andersen?<eos> So who's lying?<eos> You or your missus?
- No.<eos> - You made frequent trips to the island where both women work.<eos> You blame Gemma and Sophia for your son's death, don't you?<eos> And you was there looking for proof.<eos> And did you find some proof?
Because she bullied her.<eos> After their mother left, I was raising two girls on my own.<eos> Beth was so beautiful, but... .. Gemma did something to my little girl.<eos> And I couldn't undo it.<eos> Why'd you wait over a decade?
Nothing anybody can do about it.<eos> Please. They don't have much, but I can put something together.<eos> We can pay you. You work for money, don't you?<eos> Mister?<eos> It's true what you say, isn't it?
You too!<eos> Na... vy... SEAL.<eos> No.<eos> Sir.<eos> Please. Whatever you want...
Uh, yes. Yes.<eos> So, you've spoken to SymcoPetro.<eos> They'll pay you.<eos> Did they tell you that?<eos> Whatever it is you want, they'll give it to you.
I cut.<eos> To you.<eos> Mm, call.<eos> Here's 5,000.<eos> 45 to you.
Fudge is not a person.<eos> He wasn't in the war.<eos> Well, neither was Tom Cruise, and look what "Top Gun" did for you.<eos> You lied to me, you lied to my face, and I can't let you get away with it.<eos> I-I think we just... we're just gonna have to agree to disagree, so, uh, can I get you that coffee to go or...?
- Yeah, let's do this.<eos> You bring your commander down here, and I'll explain to him how you let us on the base, red-carpet treatment.<eos> No, b-because you lied your way in.<eos> - Not how I remember it. - What happened... And I've got witnesses to back me up.<eos> Do you like being an Air Force Captain, huh?
- Well, yeah. Well, periodically, he is. And when he shows up in court, you better believe he'll be in a wheelchair!<eos> Right, because you're an ambulance-chasing piece of shit, 'cause you're all the same... you're the same as all the others.<eos> Always on a high horse. Always trying to make me feel like I'm...<eos> Look, um, I'm a lawyer, and this is what I do all day, every day, so h-how about this?<eos> I-I won't fly jet planes... you, uh, stay out of court.

- I mean, it's really subtle.<eos> - Better be. The face is amazing.<eos> I mean, the tiniest detail, less than a millimeter, differentiates everything.<eos> An emotion on one person can be... so troubled and on another... so beautiful.<eos> You're not trying to get somewhere, are you, Mr. Ness? Yes, actually,
You wanted proof that I sided with you and not Ramal.<eos> - And splitting my lip does that how? - Son of a bitch<eos> Kaniel Outis keeps playing, doesn't he?<eos> Where is my watch?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about. Hmm.
She looks like this?<eos> No, can't help you.<eos> Can't... or won't?<eos> Sorry. Store policy, that's all.<eos> Hey, what are you doing?
- This is Oliver.<eos> - Mr. Hampton?<eos> Yeah?<eos> This is Detective Davis with the Philadelphia Police.<eos> Do you have any time to stop by later today?
I'm okay. I'm okay.<eos> Where is everyone?<eos> You got this.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Would you recommend this place for dinner?
Because I've got him so far off his game now, he'll start to play his cards too early...<eos> Teddy.<eos> "But in return, you must take a life."<eos> show us what the tattoos mean even before the computers will, and all the people he'll be enlisting for the fight.<eos> You have to call this pay phone in France.
Santora's got a guy at transit authority.<eos> I bet you he can us what roads they've been taking and when.<eos> Then it's up to us to comb the neighborhoods, find the vehicles, and put a bullet in that son of a bitch once and for all.<eos> Unattended baggage is a security risk and may result... I got a weird request.<eos> If I give you some coordinates, can you take me to 'em?
Something I can help you with?<eos> Car service. I'm here to pick up a lady and child.<eos> They got another ride.<eos> Hit the road.<eos> Are you sure?
Bye, now.<eos> I am so sorry. Thank you for holding.<eos> How may I help you?<eos> Well, I can set you up with an appointment.<eos> Jimmy is busy at the moment, but if you'd like...
How may I help you?<eos> Well, I can set you up with an appointment.<eos> Jimmy is busy at the moment, but if you'd like...<eos> Uh, you sound like you're outdoors.<eos> Are you staying out of the sun?
Uh, you sound like you're outdoors.<eos> Are you staying out of the sun?<eos> It's a hot one today.<eos> I'm sorry, but Jimmy is unavailable at the moment.<eos> If you'd like to leave a message, Mr...
You charmed me into it.<eos> Welcome to los pollos hermanos.<eos> May I take your order?<eos> Uh, I'll have a pollos classic and a coffee, black.<eos> Would you like the pollos bonus size for 50 cents more?
Hi. Welcome to Los Pollos Hermanos.<eos> May I take your order?<eos> Gimme a number three.<eos> Potatoes, coffee.<eos> Would you like the pollos bonus size for 50 cents more?
The atmospheric acid levels above the impact site are rising while the temperature is falling.<eos> There's no doubt about it, that crater is active.<eos> And we're fresh out of probes.<eos> This is where you say we have to descend, so we can get close for our sensors to get meaningful readings.<eos> And then you point out that we'd be at the edge of what our ship is rated for, and that our Martian shadow's probably going to shoot at us.
Not only can't you break me out, but your cloaking spell won't work here.<eos> We'll see about that.<eos> What the hell?<eos> They can see you.<eos> Mr. Bane, what are you doing here?
- He does?<eos> - Andy said he tried to screw us over.<eos> - That's not true.<eos> Zeke took a shot at him. Ed had to shoot back.<eos> He made a break for it, same as you guys.
I have a bag of dope in my room.<eos> Room 115 for the dope in case any of you feel that a bag of dope would be fun to do.<eos> Not you.<eos> And not you.<eos> You two can drop by and choose something from the mini fridge.
- Those are kids. More abducted kids.<eos> Yeah, they're up there in that hole.<eos> Dear Lord.<eos> We have to get them down.<eos> Hey, you two.
He'll hang with the witch.<eos> Think Cap'n Jack's washed up, eh?<eos> I've not had a wash in years.<eos> Check the alley down there.<eos> You two, check the church. The rest of you, with me!
No, that's it!<eos> I'm going with her.<eos> You would leave me for some horologist in her knickers?<eos> Yes.<eos> You men are all alike.
Chairman of the National Business Conduct Committee.<eos> - Sir, we understand. - Member of the SIA Federal Regulation Committee.<eos> - Sir, that's enough.<eos> - Chairman of the NASD Small Order Execution Committee. I mean, you're asking me how I didn't know.<eos> Well, I'm asking you.
I know you want me to leave him, but I can't just abandon him.<eos> How am I supposed to just walk out of a 50-year marriage?<eos> He's my lifetime. He's my whole, entire memory.<eos> I don't know anything else. I've never been on my own.<eos> I'm not as brave as you two.
Well, in that case, I'll wire the funds. - Use the...<eos> - Yeah, yeah, the family account.<eos> I know about the family account.<eos> Family account?<eos> What are you boys plotting?
Just tell me a complete lie.<eos> You could... you could say anything you want to me.<eos> That's the fun about me.<eos> I lied to you.<eos> And, people, you are the future!
They deserve it, don't you think?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about whoever you are.<eos> Okay.<eos> We're gonna convict you of every murder you've ever done.<eos> You're going to convict me?
Hey!<eos> That looks so good.<eos> We should probably stop staring before it gets creepy, though.<eos> Too late.<eos> You guys are losers.
Why are you here?<eos> You don't even have detention.<eos> Oh, I know.<eos> I just like coming here to sketch people in crisis.<eos> It's you.
- Your ratty soul ain't worth two bits.<eos> - Not two bits.<eos> I'm betting the House, the House of Mystery.<eos> And since I'm including everything inside, it looks like you're the one that can't call, Abnegazar.<eos> Well, what do you say, boys?
It seems to me a simple matter.<eos> True, I thank you very much, old man.<eos> We'll get you a job in the police.<eos> Listen, I watch a television series.<eos> Called "Lo and Order" They solve crimes faster than you.
Small village up north. Outskirts of baqubah.<eos> I mean, a Toyota filled with dead terrorists... Doesn't seem like a big problem, sir.<eos> No, the big problem is the big fucking hole we left in their water station when the apaches fired on them.<eos> Command wants some of our guys to attach to the sf team on the ground.<eos> You'll report to a captain syverson and run water to the town.
Tell him...<eos> I understand your fear.<eos> But if we don't have help, there's not gonna be any water.<eos> No water. Tell him, machmoud. No water.<eos> He say you destroyed the water, you fix it. It's your problem.
It's a community center, not only for children.<eos> That's great.<eos> Just stop shooting at us.<eos> We... we don't shoot. Not the people at the school.<eos> We want the same thing as you do.
It's good to meet you guys.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Why'd I have to wake up?<eos> Think you dropped this.<eos> You wrote this?
I never left him, I never left you.<eos> I never left Missy.<eos> He's a beauty, isn't he?<eos> Created to fly.<eos> You, on the other hand, were created to be loved.
What are you gonna do... sit by the pool all day long?<eos> - Seriously? - I-I don't even know how to dive.<eos> I will teach you everything you need to know.<eos> But I need one of those, like, diving card certification.<eos> You took that whole class!
How many people do you think there would be in this country without wars?<eos> I'm not saying that the Civil War wasn't fought for legitimate reasons but, if everyone had been able to go on fucking instead of going to war, any war, anywhere in the world, how many people would that leave on our dying planet?<eos> Do the arithmetic for me, for the next time we meet.<eos> I'm gonna go outside and get a breath of fresh air.<eos> Just, clean up after yourselves, you sad, pathetic, doomed shitheads.
Nina, could we have some privacy, please?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Why don't we sit over here?<eos> Katelyn, sit over there, please.<eos> You two on the other side.
You're less affected.<eos> You know he needs a higher dose.<eos> And I know you got more money squirreled away.<eos> That money's to get us out of here.<eos> No, not us. You and him.
Right or wrong, it's a brand.<eos> A brand sticks.<eos> Now you run on home to your mother, and tell her everything's all right.<eos> And there aren't any more guns in the valley.<eos> Who are you guys?
He believes you've been dispensing delayed information... to allow your friends to stay one step ahead.<eos> I'm offering you the possibility of redemption, Caliban.<eos> To protect the world, and in the process, save your friends.<eos> The girl is a rather small price to pay for that.<eos> Unlike you, she's impure.
She is so sweet.<eos> Do you like it?<eos> Yes.<eos> My brother hurt his leg.<eos> What are you doing here?
This time I'm gonna kill your ass.<eos> Just take it easy.<eos> Take a deep breath, okay?<eos> Hey!<eos> You two.
A family? Home?<eos> Really, I understand.<eos> So, just let me get out of here, right?<eos> Let me just walk away. I'll vanish, I'll go forever.<eos> What do you say?
Not just view it digitally.<eos> - Good thinking.<eos> - That's what I do.<eos> That's the way I am.<eos> And you two will help me translate what these writings actually mean if indeed writings is what they are.
Contrary to Richard's very kind words about our work the etchings proved, because of Miss Turner's intuition... - ...to be extremely simple to decipher.<eos> - Ray Charles could have done it.<eos> Well, not quite that simple, but with today's high speed computers translations of unknown codes and languages are much easier.<eos> There's no need for a Rosetta Stone.<eos> You both are quite humble.
You could've killed yourself. Or us.<eos> - Back off, bossman. - Hey!<eos> [Billy] Oh, come on, guys.<eos> Wow. - Guys, guys, guys, come on! - Watch it!<eos> [Alpha 5] Wait. What are you doing?
I wanna say this is the second coming. I wanna say this is the longest nightmare that I have ever had.<eos> But I just... I don't know what happened.<eos> Atleast... Atleast we're here together.<eos> Can you please close the blinds?<eos> Where did you all go?
They say that god only...<eos> He just must have more to say these days.<eos> Well it's still good to know that we're not alone.<eos> We hadn't been alone. It's worse.<eos> You and I.
Longing for a foregone home.<eos> Perhaps a home that never was.<eos> And none of it matters.<eos> Even if god exists, he's forsaken us.<eos> You, human, go forth.
We have to go.<eos> Now.<eos> Don't shoot!<eos> Conrad, which way are we going?<eos> You three need to go back to the boat.
It's that way.<eos> Wait for us till dawn.<eos> If we're not back by then, just go.<eos> You ain't gotta twist my arm.<eos> Where are you two going?
These drip feeds will keep the drug in your bloodstreams at exactly the right levels.<eos> Nothing that is happening to you now will stay with you for more than a few minutes.<eos> I'm afraid that some of the memories you've had up to this point might also be corrupted.<eos> I'm going to share something with you now, something personal and of importance to me.<eos> I have a need to confess, but you, I think, might have a need to forget.
Or close the wall up with our English dead!<eos> Set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide!<eos> Hold hard the breath and build up every spirit to his full height!<eos> On! On, you noblest English whose blood is fet from fathers of war-proof!<eos> And you, good yeoman, Whose limbs were made in England, show us here the mettle of your pasture.
Set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide!<eos> Hold hard the breath and build up every spirit to his full height!<eos> On! On, you noblest English whose blood is fet from fathers of war-proof!<eos> And you, good yeoman, Whose limbs were made in England, show us here the mettle of your pasture.<eos> Which I doubt not for there is none of you here so mean and base that hath not noble lustre in your eyes! I see you standing like greyhounds in the slips, straining upon the start!
- Only with a tranquilliser.<eos> - Hm.<eos> We still had ten minutes to go.<eos> - Well, we'll see about a refund.<eos> Right, you two, Wiggins has got your money by the gate, don't spend it all in one crack den.
Are you all right?<eos> Interesting.<eos> All right, there you go, you got what you wanted, and he's dead.<eos> Dead or alive, he really wasn't very interesting.<eos> But you three, you three were wonderful.
That's awful!<eos> Bad news, baby!<eos> What are we going to do?<eos> My job is to find out exactly what that new puppy is... so that Baby Corp can stop it.<eos> And you're going to help me.
My ears!<eos> Stop it!<eos> Little brats!<eos> Nothing is going to get in the way of my vengeance.<eos> Not you, not anybody!
- Candy corn?<eos> - Lollipop!<eos> Deal.<eos> Best boss ever.<eos> And you guys don't always have to toe the company line, you know?
Ravagers don't deal in kids.<eos> I told you before!<eos> I didn't know what was going on!<eos> You didn't know because you didn't want to know because it made you rich.<eos> I demand a seat at the table! I wear these flames, same as you.
Okja was created in this lab. So was her so-called mother.<eos> This is the building where Mirando experiments on their genetically mutated animals. safe and non-GMO.<eos> But that's a complete scam.<eos> Millions of GM pigs are already lining up in front of slaughterhouses.<eos> You and the other local farmers are just promotional devices for them.
- Yeah, have a seat.<eos> Now, we can all agree that this sentence,<eos> "This is a wall," is a truth claim.<eos> This wall is real.<eos> I see it, you see it.
But what if I continued to slowly brush the atoms, one by one, away from this wall?<eos> Well, at first, you'd say it's still a wall.<eos> I brush a few more, well, it's still a wall.<eos> But what if I remove every single atom from this wall except for one?<eos> And you've seen me brush every single atom from this wall except for that one atom, and I point to it, and I say, "There, that's what's left."
Now, that was three weeks ago.<eos> Meter's still running. It's up to 52.<eos> So let me get this straight. People were playing games.<eos> He made a bet where he lost $20,000.<eos> But you want him to pay you back $52,000?
He does not make enough money to pay back $52,000 for anything.<eos> We are not wealthy people.<eos> We drive cheap, terrible cars.<eos> We are the 99 percenters.<eos> And we are shit on enough. And we are certainly not gonna be shit on by the likes of you.
$25,000.<eos> That is my first, last, and only offer to you.<eos> What kind of world are we living in where people can behave like this?<eos> Treat other people this way without any compassion or feeling for their suffering?<eos> We are living in a dark, dark age, and you are part of the problem.
Sheriff Truman, I'm not here.<eos> I'm on my lunch break.<eos> Oh, Sheriff. Oh.<eos> No lunch in the conference room, Chad.<eos> I know, but... you guys have donuts and coffee in here all the time.
You shouldn't be here.<eos> Why, Mr. Rand, I have a mind to report you to HR.<eos> You think this is a game?<eos> You're using my company, my building, to sell poison!<eos> Is that really so different than what you're doing on the top floor?
She doesn't represent us.<eos> She... she is part of a rogue faction of the Hand that deals drugs and destroys lives,<eos> - but that is not who we are.<eos> - That's your story?<eos> That she's the bad Hand and you're the good Hand?
- you think Bakuto will come here?<eos> - Well, hell, I would.<eos> You know, they may claim to have loftier ideals, but the Hand are just common criminals with good marketing skills.<eos> You take their money and they'll come running.<eos> You two stake out the compound.
Now you look just like your dad.<eos> When I was little, didn't you say I was better looking than my dad?<eos> You are a smart-aleck like your dad, for sure.<eos> No, I am not like him.<eos> You are both archaeologists.
All units, we got a 10-66.<eos> Requesting backup immediately.<eos> - I can't open my door!<eos> - Take what you can. Hey!<eos> What the hell do you kids think you're doing?
Okay, I don't know how much of this I can take.<eos> - This sounds insane.<eos> - And so does being bulletproof.<eos> The two of you trust me, so please listen when I say... you're on the same side.<eos> Now, we're gonna leave you two alone, and you're gonna talk.
- Bad news.<eos> We gotta go.<eos> Elektra?<eos> Come on.<eos> Who are you people?
And the Devil of Hell's Kitchen, whoever he is.<eos> I'm so happy you're all on board with the plan.<eos> But let me remind you, I neutralized our enemies.<eos> I brought you the Iron Fist.<eos> I was able to keep the most important operation in our history running while you succumbed to chaos and conflict.
- It's basic training.<eos> They taught us how to run from the bombs, not set 'em.<eos> So what you're saying is once someone activates the charge...<eos> That's it.<eos> You two put 'em in place.
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. You know the usual hypocrisy of the digital world.<eos> We want everything in the cloud and yet our leaders... live above it.<eos> So, I want to invite Eamon and Tom to join me in this experiment that they have pioneered.<eos> I invite them to set an example for The Circle and the world... to go transparent.<eos> What do you say, guys?
Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm tired of hiding.<eos> These passwords and secret knocks, the difference between public and private...<eos> Aren't you all?
No way.<eos> It's too much money.<eos> All right, next plan.<eos> Dee.<eos> Yeah, no, I've got a great plan, but, uh, I'm thinking that this isn't my problem, and, also, you guys wouldn't listen to me no matter what I said.
Are you all finished?<eos> Come on.<eos> You can open your eyes now, I know you're not dead.<eos> Ah, geez.<eos> You big city folks sure like to complicate things, don't ya?
Aga-aga-aga-agoo. I'm sorry.<eos> Do I hear someone upstairs?<eos> Oh, neighbor!<eos> Just swingin' by to say, "Hello."<eos> Will you look at that?
- Makes me want to throw up.<eos> - You know what I think is happening right now?<eos> - Just what happened.<eos> I think the guy's coming by because you stole his watch.<eos> Oh, right, you jacked his wallet or something so he'd come over and you-you...
You do you!<eos> - You do you!<eos> - You do you!<eos> We don't judge, Cricket, we don't judge.<eos> What are you doing?
- You do you!<eos> - You do you!<eos> We don't judge, Cricket, we don't judge.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Guys, guys, guys, what in the hell are you doing?
- But that's free labor.<eos> - Yeah, yeah.<eos> - That's kind of better.<eos> - Get him for free.<eos> You're not... you're not getting...
- they don't. - (Dennis groans)<eos> DENNIS:<eos> Don't leave.<eos> Please, don't leave.<eos> Guys, what are you doing?
Come on.<eos> Come on, now oh...<eos> Stop, stop!<eos> Goddamn it, stop.<eos> What are you guys doing?
Hey, hey, hey, hey!<eos> Stop!<eos> Stop!<eos> Stop.<eos> What are you...
And he is happy with you.<eos> And that's all i ever wanted.<eos> Turn it up.<eos> Newsreader". Christian grey and his colleague ros Bailey have been found safe and well and are, at this moment, on their way back to Seattle.<eos> What the hell are you all doing here?
Gary, where are you?<eos> Fantastic.<eos> How are you ever gonna get me out of here now?<eos> Why didn't you warn us?<eos> Hey, you're the rescuers here, I believe.
It was- - It was stronger than me.<eos> That music, I couldn't fight it.<eos> And you even loved it, didn't you?<eos> You're done, girl, just like the rest of us.<eos> I don't know about you but I'd love a little break, like, a pollen break.
Baby.<eos> Of all the stunts you could pull.<eos> - Where are they going?<eos> - Nowhere. Not yet.<eos> You two, out!
They want to know, you have proof, ,<eos> You guys are awesome, but not only the super powers that make you great,<eos> You taught me to find dignity to gain friendship,<eos> I found it, We are a true friend,<eos> Like you,
You and Diz got an advance on your salary last week.<eos> You forgot that?<eos> Yeah, but all the cash that pass through this joint...<eos> Yeah. We should get envelopes, too.<eos> Because we work just as hard as you and we practice just as much.
Burner phone, right?<eos> Nah.<eos> Scrambled.<eos> Same number but they got some sort of micro-router.. To bury the signal path which means Dom is clearly.. Communicating with somebody that is above our pay grade.<eos> Look, I do not know Dom as well as you, but if we just look at the facts.
All show and no..<eos> Well I got plenty of goal.<eos> You must have misplaced that. When I kicked your ass up in down that office of yours.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Just like you Brits, rewriting History, huh?
Photograph everything before you take him down.<eos> No, wait.<eos> Don't do anything yet.<eos> Code four.<eos> Looks like two of you will be leaving the block today, Money.
And there will be no warning shots.<eos> You cliqued up with anyone? No.<eos> Why participate in the riot?<eos> You know why.<eos> You got your rules and we got the gang's rules.
And the Glocks from Austria, not the U.S.<eos> Totally untraceable. Nice.<eos> Shotgun's still not answering.<eos> Pull your cell batteries, in case he got pinched.<eos> You two, you ride in the back, since you're both validated.
- Your word is your bond! - All right, just relax. Give me the keys.<eos> Thank you, Steve.<eos> I got this.<eos> Hell yeah, fool.<eos> Two large pepperoni pizzas. You ordered them, right?
Actually, what I meant to say was dickheads.<eos> Dickhead one, dickhead two.<eos> - Hey, fuck you, man!<eos> - How's that? - Hey, what's your problem, bro!<eos> - You're my problem.
Atticus?<eos> If it was down to me, you'd have been dead long ago.<eos> Delaney orders you shouldn't be harmed.<eos> There's still plenty of cocks left for you to suck.<eos> The agreement is that you take the ladies away in the coach and I walk back to the house and report that they were kidnapped.
Their whereabouts are... known to just a handful of trusted directors so, to ensure their safe delivery, we humbly suggest you assign a monopoly.<eos> The trade in sea otter pelts for tea between Nootka and China.<eos> In favour of the loyal and... honourable East India Company.<eos> The King gets the land.<eos> You get the tea trade.
I'm gonna try and stop this woman from honking her horn And get this traffic moving.<eos> I got it, bobby.<eos> Please, ma'am. Ma'am, please.<eos> Please, ma'am...<eos> What are you doing?
And the fucks are at it again!<eos> These giant multinational corporations are filled with monstrous vermin, poisonous, vile murderers, and they eat, drink, and shit money.<eos> They buy our politicians for a song. Then these fucking politicians sing as we gag and cough, sold down the river to die.<eos> Fuck you who betray the people you were elected to help, elected to work to help to make life better for.<eos> Fuck you all in the ass, you fucking treasonous puppets!
- I do.<eos> I'm going to have the baby.<eos> - Oh, we'll do it.<eos> - Together.<eos> Wait, so are you two...
Okay.<eos> I didn't come here to manage this war, and I sure as shit didn't come here to close it out.<eos> Came here to win.<eos> I'm taking Helmand then I'm taking Kandahar.<eos> What do you say to that?
General, those boys are heading out to an inhospitable corner of the world.<eos> I'm a goddamn Ranger, Frank.<eos> Those boys, they need me.<eos> I've spent the last week or so talking to guys who I would call middle management.<eos> But you boys are at the coal face.
Cutter, I need you, Song, Carroll and Trey, head over there and get us in, all right?<eos> I need ANA guys going in first.<eos> Trey!<eos> You take those first two guys with you.<eos> You two, up! Up!
Guys, guys...<eos> Is this really that bad?<eos> I mean, yeah, it's colorful, sure. But... this is Rolling Stone, okay? It's hip.<eos> And you guys...<eos> You guys are the operators.
Why don't you go ahead and I'll meet you there like in five minutes?<eos> You're the best. Thank you.<eos> It's nothing.<eos> Are you a carpenter or what?<eos> When you're both the man and the woman of the house, you have to be a handyman and do whatever is necessary.
You guys don't have to do that.<eos> No, no... W-we'll do it all ourselves.<eos> We'll come up with our own cover.<eos> Yeah, we have our own equipment.<eos> You'll pay for it, obviously, but...
- I hired him.<eos> You what?<eos> He's a paid assassin.<eos> Yes, and now I pay him.<eos> The question is what are you two doing here?
What is my name?<eos> Say my name.<eos> This doesn't mean that I don't hate you.<eos> I know. I know. Me, too.<eos> Now that we're alone, who are you two?
Excuse me, I don't know how I got here.<eos> If you could just point me to the nearest road... look, I could...<eos> I could just get a ride from there.<eos> Please?<eos> You... y-y-you found her.
Only a witch can kill a witch.<eos> Those guns...<eos> No, those guns are supposed to kill the beast forever.<eos> We are not the beast forever, you fool.<eos> If not you, then what?
Archer.<eos> Archer!<eos> We have more important matters at hand here.<eos> More important than murder?<eos> What exactly are you doing here?
I wanted to believe that tape meant a lot of things.<eos> That our souls are eternal, and when we die, the spirit strives to find a new home.<eos> Then I saw the picture.<eos> I saw Skye's face.<eos> You saw it, too.
Well, because we paid mightily for this act of charity.<eos> It was as if God and nature itself wanted us to be rid of her.<eos> - The flood.<eos> - Yes.<eos> But I had let myself believe, like you, that she was trying to tell me something.
Can you do that?<eos> Professional courtesy.<eos> Colleague to colleague?<eos> You all think I'm like you.<eos> I am not like you.
You only matter in matters of war.<eos> And there's not going to be a war.<eos> We have the guns.<eos> We have the firepower.<eos> You have the swords and knives and hammers and stone axes.
Oh, sorry about the "shit." Sorry.<eos> Hold on a second.<eos> Then he sent me some weird picture and I'm like, "Oh, man, that's Andre Hayworth."<eos> This dude been missing for six months, right?<eos> So I do all my research, you know, 'cause as a TSA agent... You guys are detectives? I got the same training, you know?
- It's only for a week.<eos> - I know.<eos> Well, it's not like he's some stranger.<eos> It's him.<eos> You guys are you.
Need time to think about it?<eos> All right.<eos> I don't need these.<eos> All right, now listen.<eos> If any of you idiots... think of taking this to the cops, let me remind you that I am me and you are you, right?
You motherfucking genius.<eos> Really.<eos> Very clever.<eos> Well done.<eos> Although it creates a problem for me because, you know, I really like money, especially my own money, so if I kill the three of you, then I have to write it off, and, you know, a businessman,
"Hey, Johnnie, what's up?<eos> "How you doing?<eos> Yeah." from the Mitchell Brothers.<eos> They say, "You know you're the star of this movie."<eos> I go, "What you talking about, man?"
- That picture's all over school.<eos> - Yeah. That can happen, can't it?<eos> What are you trying to do?<eos> Anything.<eos> I'm trying to do something, anything, which is more than any of you did.
I've seen them in the newspapers.<eos> So they're playing to win.<eos> We'll do the same.<eos> They're gonna go after our girl.<eos> What are you guys doing?
Marcus Cole, presiding.<eos> Courtney Crimsen, recording secretary.<eos> All members present.<eos> Petitioners, please state your names.<eos> That's you, guys.
It's her writing.<eos> I can totally recognize it.<eos> Why would she write something like this? So humiliating.<eos> It has been brought to my attention that Ryan's publication now includes poetry.<eos> And since we're doing sonnets this semester, and since you're all going to be distracted by it anyway, I thought we would take a minute to parse the work of this poet.
And you failed. So any arrangement we had is now done... Null and void.<eos> We aren't trade partners, we aren't friends. And we never met.<eos> We don't know each other.<eos> I owe you nothing.<eos> In fact, you owe me for taking in the refugees, at great personal risk.
This.<eos> I'm Rick.<eos> We own your lives.<eos> You want to buy them back?<eos> Have anything? Well, you have one of my people.
Yeah. I did.<eos> I didn't have a choice.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> Tara: I said I didn't have a choice.<eos> But you do, both of you do.
What are you talking about? We need your guns.<eos> What?<eos> We're gonna fight The Saviors.<eos> You should join us.<eos> No. The Saviors killed your fathers, your brothers, husbands, sons, and you ran from them.
But Eugene?<eos> He's one of yours.<eos> And after what he did... He stepped up.<eos> You people... are animals.<eos> Universe gives you a sign, and you just shove your finger right up its ass.
You're all getting tested every two weeks.<eos> You girls have to think about your life after this.<eos> If you get something, nobody's gonna want you.<eos> Okay?<eos> You two, you two have a cam show at 5?
Jerry, get out of the booth, take all your clothes off, and fold yourself 12 times.<eos> You got it.<eos> Six folds, huh?<eos> W-W-What, have you guys got me in a Series 9000?<eos> You cheap insect [bleep] didn't think I was worth your best equipment?
And I'm getting better grades than when you and Dad were...<eos> Quote mode... "staying together for the kids."<eos> End quote mode.<eos> "Quote mode." I like that.<eos> You millennials.
Let's say... you have to hit... five three pointers in... five minutes... or...<eos> I don't know, the whole place... the whole planet will get blown up with a n-neutrino bomb.<eos> And try to make it a-a lesson about... yourselves, like... like how selfish you are... Are or something.<eos> And also Hawaii.<eos> You guys hit the baskets, I'll disarm the drunkenly-improvised neutrino bomb.
The executions of the men captured on the beach yesterday.<eos> It's for the best to have it done.<eos> It could have been you.<eos> I gave you... both of you, a place to stand here.<eos> I gave you a life, and you repaid me by conspiring with my enemies.
Mr. Gary Busey's coming back from heaven on the 14th.<eos> How is he gonna know where to land?<eos> All right.<eos> Here's what I'm gonna do.<eos> I'm gonna let you keep Gary up there, but you guys have to be my deputies.
Should I start, or...<eos> - Is she mine?<eos> - No, you got the other one.<eos> Okay, here's what's gonna happen.<eos> St. Cloud Homicide's gonna handle this case, and you're both gonna go back to...
The earth soaking in blood, frozen red.<eos> All of Russia.<eos> Hundreds of years, millions the tsar killed, then it was Lenin, then Stalin.<eos> Ten thousand, 20,000.<eos> But here you have, like, what?
Thank you.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> That means we're halfway there.<eos> They believe.<eos> Do you believe?
Is that clear?<eos> Yes, sir!<eos> Now get undressed.<eos> Fall out!<eos> You too, lieutenant.
Don't worry, I'll go and see the Carlana and ask her to rent us her mill.<eos> She'll slam the door in your face.<eos> She lent me the Carlán's mare, to help our cause.<eos> Because you're a gentleman.<eos> And you are her neighbours.
Look who it is!<eos> Welcome, Master Lluís.<eos> Come and see.<eos> Try one of the loaves, they're still warm.<eos> You lot keep working.
You don't know me.<eos> Nobody's ever really loved you.<eos> But I'm ready to.<eos> Don't you see?<eos> I'm getting old, and you're just starting to live.
He has diphtheria. Without an antiserum, he'll die in a few days.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I know you don't want to talk to me, but I want to help.<eos> What can I do?<eos> There's no antiserum on this side, but you know people on the other side.
The penalties are the same as if he actually did it.<eos> The boy just wanted to see his father.<eos> We're all going.<eos> Do they think we're terrorists, too, huh?<eos> No, but you haven't been online praising suicide bombers.
They're coming down the east stairwell, ma'am, and evacuating through the back entrance.<eos> I can't leave without them.<eos> Ma'am, my orders are to put you in this vehicle.<eos> Now get in.<eos> You and you in number one.
A pimple waits until you're 12 to come on your face.<eos> Righty-o, then.<eos> The lady has free reign.<eos> No law can govern the lioness.<eos> And as for you fellas, there's only one rule, so learn it well.
Frasier!<eos> No! Please.<eos> No!<eos> Hey! You people are sick!<eos> One of your people is out there murdered, floating in the water, and you're in here doing this!
Help me! Come on!<eos> Get him out! Get him the fuck out!<eos> Get him off, God damn it! Get him off!<eos> Stop! Stop!<eos> - What are you doing?
Stand down. Just wait!<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> We escaped the governor's men.<eos> Came back to rejoin the fight, but didn't know if the harbor was safe to enter.<eos> What are you doing here?
We're not going to stay and wait for the Americans to find us.<eos> If we don't act now, we'll achieve nothing.<eos> - You're coming with us.<eos> - I'm not going anywhere.<eos> And neither are you.
It's down this way.<eos> Oh! Visual of suspect!<eos> Lower your weapons! - Lower your weapons! - Carter!<eos> - Carter! - Lower your weapon!<eos> - You lower your weapons!
We'll find them.<eos> But we had them.<eos> I had them!<eos> I found them. For you.<eos> I tracked Jadalla, and you and your men lost them.
Now I need you to tell me exactly how you two communicated.<eos> I have never been in communications with this... Jadalla person.<eos> I went through all of this at CTU.<eos> Well... this isn't CTU.<eos> Who the hell are you people?
Uh, based on what I'm seeing, ten, maybe 12 more minutes.<eos> You're wasting your time.<eos> God is on my side.<eos> There is only one possible outcome for all of this, and we both know what that is.<eos> You people will lose.
We know what "hasty" means.<eos> Hello there!<eos> Salutations!<eos> Shalom!<eos> You must be the Baudelaire children!
- It looks like a list.<eos> Wrong!<eos> It's a list.<eos> A list of chores.<eos> Rich brats like you are probably spoiled rotten and have never done a chore in your life.
How in the fuck would I know which way he decided to go?<eos> All Flint needs is an hour, maybe less, to conceal that chest in a way we couldn't hope to recover.<eos> Every moment we stand here deliberating is a moment closer to his victory.<eos> The three of you, that way.<eos> You, the other trail now!
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Look at the time!<eos> The conversation has been so stimulating that the evening has just flown by.<eos> - Yeah. You have a meeting.<eos> - I have a meeting, yes.<eos> I don't know about the rest of you, but Kala and I are really beginning to love these family dinners.
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Look at the time!<eos> The conversation has been so stimulating that the evening has just flown by.<eos> - Yeah. You have a meeting.<eos> - I have a meeting, yes.<eos> I don't know about the rest of you, but Kala and I are really beginning to love these family dinners.
One of these days, that shit-for-brains is going to realize that dropping you was the sorriest, stupidest mistake he's ever made.<eos> Not a mistake. It's not a mistake, Dani.<eos> It's a reality.<eos> They accepted it. And I have accepted it.<eos> Now you two have to.
If you see me at the coffee machine, you wait until Steph is there before you pitch me the cream.<eos> I am a survivor.<eos> And I will do whatever it takes to avoid my fate.<eos> Ask yourselves...<eos> Are you?
So how do I keep you?<eos> You kind of can't.<eos> Just look at him.<eos> The everyman grilling away.<eos> You know, he sent the chef away tonight because the two of you always do this together.
Okay, but I wanna hold the keys.<eos> What are you whispering about?<eos> We're talking about who's gonna hold the keys!<eos> It's me.<eos> I will hold the keys, I will open the cage, and I will select a medicine, and you will all stand aside.
Me, too.<eos> Not not.<eos> Don't do that.<eos> Hey!<eos> You!
Okay, then what are you here for?<eos> What are you protecting?<eos> Or is it something you're hunting?<eos> Something that got away?<eos> Something you let out.
- No, no, it's okay.<eos> It's not the first time I've been given shit about the kimono.<eos> Well, look, uh, since we're all here, why don't we-- i made us some food.<eos> We can all sit down and have a nice dinner and talk.<eos> What do you-- what--what do you say?
Greetings.<eos> Sister Julienne!<eos> Oh, my dear.<eos> You look so very well. And happy.<eos> Oh, I've just delivered a beautiful little boy, and you've all come home!
What?<eos> Clark, what?<eos> Look. Look.<eos> The growth pattern, it's undeniable.<eos> What are you guys talking about?
No, I don't.<eos> Just another reminder that there's nothing I can do until Ezra's done helping her.<eos> Obviously, she still needs him.<eos> Uh, guys, please don't give me the sad eyes.<eos> You two found your way back to each other.
Because of them, Ontari, your rightful commander, is dead.<eos> This imposter stole her Flame.<eos> No.<eos> Wanheda saved us, all of us... Grounder and Skaikru.<eos> There would have been nothing to save us from if not for you.
I wish it was that easy.<eos> Today, you guys.<eos> I need more time.<eos> I know how it feels to lose someone you care about to war, but we do what we do for our people.<eos> You slaughter us, we slaughter you.
I met a girl upstairs who's looking for a roommate.<eos> - You're leaving us?<eos> - Just your couch.<eos> I liked having you around.<eos> Hey, you two... you're up.
A man who is willing to die for his principles.<eos> Do you hear me?<eos> Yes, Baron.<eos> Our brother, Gabriel, gave his life for our struggle.<eos> Will you?
Too late.<eos> Go to the rooftops.<eos> They're all over the Rover. - We'll never get to it.<eos> - I can get in that pickup, make a ruckus on my way out.<eos> Any luck, they'll be all over me. Then you got a clean shot to the Rover.
No.<eos> BonBon, please don't lie to us.<eos> Why would I lie to you right now?<eos> Are you being serious?<eos> I don't know anything that you don't know.
Of course she's gonna be asking questions.<eos> Or she's a spy trying to bring us all down.<eos> Hey, guys. I just wanted to say I'm sorry.<eos> Laurel was right.<eos> None of us knew Wes like you all did, and I can't imagine what you must all be feeling.
- You can at least try.<eos> These people will hurt us, all of us.<eos> That's what they did to me.<eos> I was pregnant, eight months, and they murdered my baby.<eos> I was just like you... just trying to do the right thing, stood up to them and they destroyed my life.
Because he was afraid of this, that you would think he did it, when the truth is he was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.<eos> Yeah, maybe that's what he wants us to believe.<eos> Will you stop attacking him, please?<eos> All of you have done terrible things, and you have asked me to believe that you did them for the right reasons.<eos> Well, now you need to do the same thing for Connor.
Whip's right.<eos> The strikes are getting closer.<eos> I pity you. I triumph either way.<eos> Either I will be in paradise or Allah will save me.<eos> You, you're just going to die.
Salamanca money!<eos> Salamanca blood!<eos> You have to calm down.<eos> That hacienda! I paid for it.<eos> And you treat us like dogs!
But some of us have a more enlightened view.<eos> Abu Ramal was a great visionary.<eos> You have our sincerest condolences.<eos> What do you want?<eos> The same thing you do, to eliminate the men who killed him.
That's why we got someone even more clever.<eos> Thoreau?<eos> Guy's a pencil neck.<eos> A pencil neck with insight into Scofield's plan.<eos> So you, in turn, can be the hammer.
What...<eos> Everyone has something to prove trying to claim that Primo title.<eos> Isn't that how you found it?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> I'm not like you.
I take the Martian and you let us walk out.<eos> Look, we both know how this goes.<eos> Important, powerful people start fighting each other, it's people like us that die.<eos> I've got nothing against you. You've got nothing against me.<eos> I need to keep control of the undersecretary. Not you.
Your team fucking sucks.<eos> Why don't you shut up, Mr. Clean?<eos> - Mikey, leave it.<eos> - What are you a Jacksonville fan?<eos> You guys always lose.
I would if I could, but I can't tell you what I don't know.<eos> Dot must have wiped my memory.<eos> I can't believe you lied to Aldertree.<eos> I couldn't let him go after Jace like he did before.<eos> So Dot took down the wards and you two jumped off the ship together?
Nothing to see.<eos> It's a false alarm.<eos> Just some dumbass kids pulling a prank.<eos> All right, you have a good night, huh?<eos> You, too.
Causing the host to violently act on those urges.<eos> So we continue to scan for venom and heat signatures.<eos> Try to narrow down the host before it strikes again.<eos> Alec, you check the living quarters.<eos> You two take the utility tunnels.
It's a means to an end.<eos> I can't believe that you are siding with this dog.<eos> Lucian may be a Downworlder now, but he has more honor than you ever will.<eos> I said let her go.<eos> You Graymarks never see the bigger picture, do you?
Oh, yeah?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, I'll just have to see about that.<eos> Jace. Hey.<eos> What the hell are you doing?
Hey, we are on something of a clock here.<eos> Oh, my God. It's Rip.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> We got you, Rip.<eos> Who the hell are you guys?
Huh. So you're kinda like a shark who'll die if you stay in one place.<eos> We are all going to die if you don't...<eos> It's too late.<eos> It's here.<eos> Ah, well, the good news is you two finally got what you wanted, you managed to balance our partnership.
- I have no way of protecting myself.<eos> - I'm pretty sure she'll be here tomorrow.<eos> Maybe you should take a self-defense class or something.<eos> You both should.<eos> What do you say?
You go get some sleep, all right?<eos> - I love you.<eos> - I love you.<eos> Hey, Ma.<eos> You guys settled in all right?
- and that's assuming the other two show.<eos> - Listen, the point is to do it for Jude.<eos> Right? And maybe with fewer kids, they'll ask more questions.<eos> Huh?<eos> Oh my... No. Hey, are you guys all here for sex ed?
What'd you do?<eos> Uh... I was in a car accident.<eos> They think it was my fault.<eos> - And it's none of your business.<eos> - You all up in my business all the time.
Hasn't your family done enough damage to Anchor Beach?<eos> I'm not gonna let you take my school.<eos> Thing is... you don't have a say.<eos> What's happening?<eos> What the hell are you doing?
Why shouldn't I do the same for myself?<eos> Because what I did and what you're doing are not the same thing!<eos> Sure they are.<eos> We all do whatever it takes to survive, and if that means breaking a few laws or betraying the people who believe in you, so be it!<eos> What are you doing?
We just have to remain alert.<eos> We're not just the anti-Prometheus team.<eos> There are a lot of people in this city who need saving.<eos> I'm on Chase.<eos> You guys just focus on protecting the city.
Kord Industries.<eos> I mean, they set the encryption.<eos> They can break it.<eos> I don't think that Kord is gonna help us hack their stolen tech.<eos> That's why you'll have to break in.
Yeah. That's a good idea.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Very helpful, Curtis.<eos> I'm sorry, Mr. Grover, but the specifics of the investigation into Adrian Chase, they're just not open to the public.<eos> The mother of my children is dead, and you can't tell me anything.
It's a hell of a big building.<eos> If he's in there, we should get started.<eos> If Chase wanted you here for some reason, he could have been more specific about which floor.<eos> Overwatch, can you narrow the search for us?<eos> Well, normally, yes, but right now the only heat signatures I'm reading in there are you two.
Now you're both.<eos> - Any sign of Dorcas? - No, sir. 'Fraid no one's seen her.<eos> But we won't stop looking for her.<eos> If we can't protect an innocent little girl, what good are we?<eos> You men?
Because he is the only power strong enough to give you all what you deserve.<eos> Revenge is sweet, I know. And I understand your pain at the loss of your family and land...<eos> Save your pity.<eos> You understand nothing. It is not revenge I seek any more than a surgeon seeks revenge on the carcinoma he removes. You people are the carcinoma.<eos> You cannot hate the Puritans more than I.
- You shouldn't have done that.<eos> - Really? Did I not just see Harvey punch him in the face?<eos> What about you?<eos> You brought a wounded suspect into the precinct instead of taking him to the hospital, because you wanted to interrogate him.<eos> You guys can bend the rules, but I can't. None of us should... me, Harvey, you.
Officer, you look terrible. Hey, you got...<eos> Tonight, Gotham, in the darkness, there are no rules.<eos> So, tonight, Gotham... do what you want.<eos> Kill who you want.<eos> And when morning comes... you, too, shall be... reborn.
Take her. Get up.<eos> Up!<eos> Where is he?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You.
H.R., we're speedsters. We have time.<eos> - Nobody likes a braggart.<eos> - Yeah, but we were actually talking about something important before you showed up,<eos> - so...<eos> - You...
It should be honored.<eos> You know what?<eos> You're right, Julian.<eos> A deal is a deal.<eos> And our deal was that I would train so that I could fight Gypsy, but I guess you two wanted to go behind my back and try to sub in?
You guys took down Yorkin in Flashpoint.<eos> Well, then, that means she's the only one that Yorkin hasn't gone after yet.<eos> Classic example of saving the best for last.<eos> I'm on it.<eos> You guys stay here and try to figure out how to catch somebody we can't touch.
She can barely control her cold powers as is.<eos> - I mean... - We might need her for Grodd.<eos> Grodd? Gr...<eos> - Telepathic gorilla?<eos> - Yeah. Where... where are you going?
Put a little...<eos> Why did you bring us here?<eos> I didn't bring you anywhere.<eos> We're inside your heads.<eos> You created this world.
Our love is forbidden.<eos> This is just like "West Side Story."<eos> I was thinking more "Fantasticks," but...<eos> Look, the point is... we ain't telling nobody nothing.<eos> And neither are you, capisce?
Bravo!<eos> Round of applause!<eos> Standing O. That was so good!<eos> I loved it. That was a hell of a show.<eos> And you two...
Let's get 'em.<eos> Us, as in Team Flash?<eos> Guys, we have a chance to put some hope back into our lives.<eos> And I... I really need it right now.<eos> I think you do, too.
Us, as in Team Flash?<eos> Guys, we have a chance to put some hope back into our lives.<eos> And I... I really need it right now.<eos> I think you do, too.<eos> So what do you say?
Who's Barry?<eos> Not fine.<eos> Who are all of you?<eos> What's going on?<eos> Seriously, who are you guys?
- No one is ex...<eos> Well, yes, technically, yes.<eos> But... but it was consensual.<eos> - You were?<eos> You...
Who's Barry?<eos> Not fine.<eos> Who are all of you?<eos> What's going on?<eos> Seriously, who are you guys?
- No one is ex...<eos> Well, yes, technically, yes.<eos> But... but it was consensual.<eos> - You were?<eos> You...
- Yeah. Turns out, he was related to a family from Mystic Falls.<eos> And through the magic that is the Internet, I've tracked down a living descendant.<eos> He's here to claim the remains.<eos> Hey, Mr. Maxwell. Did you finish signing those forms?<eos> You... you two know each other?
I mean, we're due at an event.<eos> You have something I need.<eos> I have something you need.<eos> I have the bell.<eos> You have the tuning fork.
- Hi. Okay, those are the last names on the guest list.<eos> Perfect. Once the dance is underway, we can get out of here and find that striker.<eos> Hopefully Damon decides to answer his phone.<eos> Or we could ask him in person.<eos> What are you even doing here?
What you guys need is someone who can explain to you what's going on with your Gemini coven twins.<eos> I feel like there's someone around here who could help you with that, but I just can't quite put my finger on it.<eos> Is it... Uh. There he is.<eos> This guy.<eos> What are you thinking bringing him here?
What, did you come to watch me blow myself into oblivion?<eos> Vicki, Bonnie has a plan.<eos> I am not gonna stop ringing this bell.<eos> We don't need you to stop.<eos> Well, then what are you doing here?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> - You sure? - Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> What the hell were you thinking?<eos> I thought I was being quite responsible bringing her directly to the hospital.<eos> You mean after the two of you went off - and interrogated a felon on bail?
If Ishim can help me find whoever killed Benjamin, then I have to.<eos> Okay, yeah, look,<eos> I-I get that we need super dick there, but, I mean, come on.<eos> The angels that I served with are being killed.<eos> So I will put up with Ishim, I will put up with everything else, and so will you.
Quite.<eos> We're eager to collaborate.<eos> But you haven't exactly seen us at our best.<eos> She tried to kill us.<eos> And all you wanna do is help these American hunters to clear this country of monsters?
Sam and Dean aren't our... biggest fans.<eos> Yeah, 'cause you, tortured them.<eos> We've been through that.<eos> Right.<eos> It wasn't you, it was your, "rogue operative."
We've had two murders in two days.<eos> The police have no idea what's going on, and...<eos> Well, that's why we're here.<eos> Now you said victim number two brought some Timber Troopers through here, right?<eos> 16 hours ago, they were standing right where you are.
And you said you were a demon.<eos> Titles, labels.<eos> I'm a demon, you're Rosemary, complete with baby.<eos> Please.<eos> You humans.
Anyway, why are you alone?<eos> Jody's busy with sheriff stuff.<eos> And she said to call if I found anything.<eos> So you called her?<eos> You called first.
Plus, she'd agreed to end the pregnancy.<eos> And I guess she changed her mind.<eos> Even with everything Kelly knew, it... It was still her kid. She couldn't.<eos> Then you should have!<eos> You should've shot her between the eyes immediately. Why?
Did you kill her?<eos> No. But...<eos> She's difficult to kill, okay?<eos> Yeah. You think?<eos> All right, so what are you doing here, then?
Can I help you?<eos> Yes, please.<eos> We're, uh, we're looking for, uh... Max?<eos> Alicia?<eos> What are you two doing here? Mom!
Like my dad.<eos> I can do it.<eos> I...<eos> I should do it.<eos> You two get out of here.
Yes, heavily. Heavy enough to stop Lucifer?<eos> Lucifer?<eos> He could be right behind us.<eos> I don't...<eos> What are you doing here?
He believes himself to be above each one of us.<eos> And so a secret bargain was made with my uncle.<eos> 200 spears.<eos> In return I shall require the head of Osbert.<eos> What are you doing?
I expect repayment.<eos> I hear you, Ceolwulf.<eos> I consider our lands to be one...<eos> No, we are not one.<eos> We are Mercia and you are Wessex.
Wessex could never turn away from Mercia.<eos> It would be akin to Alfred turning away from Aelswith.<eos> It could never occur, Lord Ceolwulf. Never.<eos> What is this?<eos> Each time I talk of swords and spears and yet you insist on speaking of unions... and of ki...
Until then, she will remain in the tower room for safekeeping.<eos> - That is all.<eos> - You're a terrible man.<eos> I may be a terrible man, but I have concocted a foolproof way of getting your fortune.<eos> What have you done?
My marriage to Violet Baudelaire is perfectly legal, and I am now in control of her entire fortune.<eos> That can't be true!<eos> On the contrary, Judgikins, the law of the land clearly states that the bride must say "I do"<eos> and sign the appropriate document in her own hand.<eos> And all of you, ladies and gentlemen, are witnesses.
And what's more important, answers.<eos> You must have oodles of questions after that movie.<eos> If my parents hadn't taught me about this when I was your age, my head would be dizzy with confusion.<eos> Well, once we disembark in Chimbote, you will have all the answers you need.<eos> What do you say, Baudelaires?
The mines.<eos> Let's go.<eos> - It'll be dark soon.<eos> - Eat a carrot.<eos> You two are staying here.
Sweet!<eos> Let's go.<eos> Off the bike.<eos> Come on.<eos> You two stay there.
So where is it?<eos> Please.<eos> Please.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> You... have been in touch this whole time?
The lawyers.<eos> I mean... that's the lawyer's share of the settlement.<eos> And your share is...<eos> boop! ... this much. Doo!<eos> If Irene holds out, the lawyers get this much more... and you are gonna get this much more.
B-9.<eos> Okay... what's next?<eos> [Air hisses] We got... I-29.<eos> I remember when I was 29.<eos> Bet you do, too.
And now it's her turn to have my back.<eos> Doing what?<eos> That's between me and her.<eos> 12:00, black Audi.<eos> You two, with me.
My mom and I just moved here, so...<eos> - From where?<eos> - New York.<eos> Wow.<eos> Do you guys go to Riverdale?
Not yet, and don't talk about Archie.<eos> Veronica Lodge, I'd heard whisperings.<eos> I'm Cheryl Blossom, may I sit?<eos> Betty, would you mind?<eos> So, what are you three hens gossiping about?
That's why you've invited the Lodges and everyone else?<eos> To investigate them?<eos> And you think I'm manipulative and heartless and making this all about myself?<eos> I think it's great what you guys are doing for Jason.<eos> You two were on the water polo team together.
All those reporters.<eos> The worst part is how fast it happened.<eos> He was just, gone.<eos> I didn't even get a chance to say goodbye.<eos> That's why I think it's so great. You're all getting a chance to say goodbye to Jason tomorrow...
No. No, no, it's just...<eos> I'm an Andrews, Mr. Blossom, like you said.<eos> My dad works construction, a fancy banquet's not really our thing.<eos> That's precisely why you should come.<eos> People like you are the bedrock of our town.
All those for Cheryl?<eos> All those for Veronica?<eos> Never cross a Lodge.<eos> Come on, girls.<eos> You catatonic bimbos didn't even vote.
But, that's not exactly what happened...<eos> Let the Mayor finish, Ms. Cooper.<eos> Archie, the Pussycats will be performing at the Jubilee, and I would love for you to join them.<eos> Betty, I think it's important that we hear from Riverdale's best and brightest.<eos> - What do you say, both of you? - Uh...
I'd like to thank Mayor McCoy for inviting me to speak on this historic day.<eos> Seventy-five years of Riverdale...<eos> But what is Riverdale?<eos> It's the people, right?<eos> You, me, our friends, our neighbors.
You can't find him.<eos> He's Sons of Lucifer.<eos> He's protected.<eos> He's got reach.<eos> You Midnighters, you like to take care of things yourselves, but in this case, don't.
- Can you play the next one without me?<eos> - You're the lead guitarist, we can't.<eos> - Great job.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> You, too.
You fellas really don't wanna be here.<eos> Hey!<eos> Put 'em down, nice and careful.<eos> Then get the hell out.<eos> Don't never come back, you Farrells.
Coal kills the sky.<eos> Coal gets the money.<eos> We get to die!<eos> Coal kills the Earth.<eos> I'm here for a job, you stupid bitches!
- He ain't done nothin' to you.<eos> He's probably the one killed Breece!<eos> What the hell are you doin'?<eos> Calm the hell down!<eos> Get off him, you animals!
I don't know.<eos> M-must have had the foresight to move her before the cops came and... searched the house.<eos> Lookin' at you standin' there... the sheriff, who's escaped from prison, out on a... mission to avenge the woman he loves... from her murderous and sick son.<eos> It's like... It's, like, too much, man.<eos> You guys are perfectly worthy adversaries.
I know what you've been doing, and I have the evidence.<eos> Please lower your voice.<eos> Will basically admitted it, you know, before he went through the Wall or whatever the hell he did.<eos> Drink that.<eos> What is it with you and Will and the whiskey?
Case dismissed.<eos> Word is, his manager paid off the owner of the car. Right.<eos> So who's the manager?<eos> - Ralph Spender. - Pleased to meet you.<eos> Now, I just want you to know I take this as seriously as you do, but believe me, there is not one iota of truth in it.
- Oh, I'm so sorry!<eos> I think we've been enjoying ourselves a little bit too much.<eos> Opinions may differ on that.<eos> I've undergone a whole series of dental examinations!<eos> That's lovely. But while you've been playing games, some of us have been trying to work.
- What's wrong with your face? It's like a long wet weekend.<eos> I don't have any friends.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> You have us.<eos> You're old.
- Oh.<eos> Where's he been lately?<eos> Just, uh, busy with school.<eos> Hey,<eos> I don't want to embarrass you or anything, but I just-- I just wanted to say, it was tough for Matthew when he started spending more time here, and you guys made it a lot easier, so...
Down south the air smells like pig shit.<eos> - You've never been down south.<eos> - I've been to Winterfell.<eos> That's the North.<eos> How do you live up here?
I'll admit it, it is a subtle distinction.<eos> We're fighting a great war.<eos> - Wars cost money.<eos> - I wanted to be one of you.<eos> I wanted to join the Brotherhood but you sold me off.
Sit down, you beautiful people.<eos> That's not cool, man.<eos> Isn't there a code?<eos> Honor among thieves?<eos> You stole from me first. Yeah.
And how much do I get for not telling Audrey?<eos> We can give you 2.<eos> 2 what?<eos> 2 million.<eos> How much are you getting?
One is my client Chayton Dockery.<eos> Audrey took his cash collateral.<eos> And when he comes for it tomorrow, let's just say, if she's lucky, she goes to prison and all of her assets will be seized and the sale of the house will be cancelled.<eos> And if she isn't lucky?<eos> Well, then she's dead, and you'll be dealing with Dockery.
N-no, I like it.<eos> I just...<eos> You think it's passionate?<eos> My gosh, yes.<eos> And it's so you two.
- 'Kay.<eos> Have fun.<eos> Not too much.<eos> Okay.<eos> You guys have fun too.
Not really.<eos> So when it says in Isiah,<eos> "You will keep in perfect peace those whose minds are steadfast because they trust in you," who is he talking about?<eos> I don't have perfect peace.<eos> Do you have perfect peace?
And this incredible woman over here.<eos> I don't want to steal from you.<eos> I want to honor you.<eos> I want to honor God and his mysterious ways.<eos> And if you want to help me share your gift with the world, then I think you might just open some hearts and minds that are cold.
- No!<eos> - Nobody's angry at Deacon.<eos> We're worried about him.<eos> We just need him to act!<eos> What the hell are you guys talking about?
She's still here... inside us.<eos> You wanna sing one of her songs?<eos> Yeah.<eos> ♪ I had that dream late last night ♪<eos> ♪ I was yours and you were mine ♪
- All right.<eos> - Who was that?<eos> Another woman interested in Dad.<eos> Please tell me you're not interested in her.<eos> You two are the only girls in my life, believe me.
Just go play some video games or something.<eos> - You'll thank me later.<eos> - Come on. You know you drank when you were our age, man.<eos> Yeah, I did a lot of stupid things when I was your age.<eos> - You look smarter.
I just wish you could have mentioned it to me first.<eos> That's what I'm saying.<eos> I didn't know I was going to do anything.<eos> So, the judge is leaning towards shared custody.<eos> What do you think?
Cyrus.<eos> Vice President Beeeeene.<eos> It's like having a vampire a heartbeat away from the Oval.<eos> Hello, Philadelphia!<eos> When we started this improbable campaign, we were told this couldn't be done... That I couldn't do it, that you wouldn't do it.
I don't know what your plan is...<eos> - Our plan...<eos> - This is insane.<eos> The president-elect is dead.<eos> - Yes. - You people did that.
But is he okay?<eos> Your friend lost a lot of blood tonight, putting him at risk of permanent brain damage.<eos> You should be prepared for him to wake up with severe deficits or not wake up at all.<eos> Right now, rest is the best thing for him.<eos> And for all of you. You should go home, try to get some sleep.
What is going on?<eos> P.T. has something to tell us. What?<eos> Thank you.<eos> I am humbled to have pierced the veil and to address you on behalf of Mr. Westmorland.<eos> Like you, I was selected.
Leave a message.<eos> I'm ready to give you what you want.<eos> I really don't know where this road leads, but I can promise you one thing.<eos> I will never forget the people who were with me from the beginning.<eos> You're the reason that I'm here, and I am... I am truly grateful.
Probably figured the DNA results would be conclusive and decided to run, but we will find her.<eos> For now, I'm gonna have to detain you, Lieutenant.<eos> He's not going anywhere.<eos> Finally drank the Kool-Aid, I see.<eos> You guys are hell-bent on sharing a cell block, huh?
And the last time you were in there?<eos> A... couple weeks ago, maybe.<eos> With Gunn?<eos> You fucker.<eos> I'm trying to help you, and this is how you do?
- I don't see one worthy pledge in here.<eos> - One, two, three. - On your feet!<eos> Get those knees up!<eos> Man... Fish must be freezing right now, huh?<eos> You lucky, boys.
It's digital.<eos> I'm gonna have to take it home and charge it.<eos> - And then you'll bring me copies?<eos> - Yeah, or email them.<eos> Oh, honestly, you kids and your technology.
Put that audio file on a thumb drive.<eos> I'll take it to Hennessey, see if he has any ideas.<eos> So once again you're going for a stroll around town while we're all stuck underground doing nothing?<eos> I know how to handle myself.<eos> You don't.
Have you talked to the doctor yet?<eos> Just waiting on a few more tests.<eos> It shouldn't be long.<eos> Rest up, okay?<eos> What have you people gotten me involved with?
There's no good out here.<eos> He wants to talk to you.<eos> You're lucky, you know?<eos> The two of you.<eos> Not everyone gets what you have.
You.<eos> Gas up our car.<eos> You.<eos> Mace your balls.<eos> You two hold hands.
About what?<eos> About Jesse.<eos> I don't like keeping secrets from me mate.<eos> I didn't know.<eos> I didn't know you and him were a...
- Mr. rose.<eos> - Marty never said you were such a city slicker.<eos> - Is that gonna be a problem?<eos> - No, not a problem, unless you make it that way.<eos> You all didn't do nothing together, now, did you?
- Pressure changes things.<eos> Makes a man write a six instead of a nine.<eos> - Not Beeker, the man's ice.<eos> - I was talking about you.<eos> - You two about done bickering?
We're gonna take such good care of you.<eos> And you remember the beautiful master bedroom, with south-facing windows and impossible-to-stain texture-plush carpeting.<eos> Mm, I love this room.<eos> Then you should buy it, along with all the other rooms.<eos> Leslie, Bill, what are you doing?
Why not?<eos> You're not going to jail for one you did commit.<eos> You owe me.<eos> I owe my children, and if I have to choose between me going to jail and you going to jail, good luck with the grand jury.<eos> Thank god it's you guys.
Please don't-!<eos> Come any closer, I kill her.<eos> Why in god's name are you doing this?<eos> Your cop friend Burkhardt put my dad in prison.<eos> So him and all of you are gonna pay for it.
- Okay.<eos> - I'm going to the spice shop.<eos> I'll check in with you from there.<eos> - Please be careful.<eos> - You too.
Where's Kelly?<eos> I'm so glad you're all here.<eos> Nick, are you all right?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I thought you were all...
Isn't for me to say, boy... but 'tis powerful.<eos> Master's not home.<eos> 'Tis the mistress we come to see.<eos> She know me by sight and name. Zachariah Martin.<eos> You two, follow me...
But no, has to be the brewery.<eos> All our ideas were shit.<eos> Pope, now's not the time, man.<eos> You don't think we deserve more of an explanation?<eos> One job goes bad, and you're whining like a bunch of spoiled brats!
It means "error," Jason, which is what this is.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> Is it an error to act unpredictably and behave in ways that run counter to how you were programmed to behave?<eos> Yes.<eos> Now, you two sit tight.
Shawn only cares about cold hard facts.<eos> If he detects any feelings in your voice, he retreats into a cocoon, so what we need to do now is just be very still and very quiet.<eos> Finally.<eos> - Oh, come... - What did he just say?<eos> Oh, because you're all so perfect.
- Yeah, I'm okay, Dad.<eos> Know where you're going?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You wanna tell me what happened back there?<eos> You seem like nice people.
Then do as we agreed.<eos> Use your lips where I might forget who you are and imagine you as I wish.<eos> Or better yet, make me stop thinking at all. Stop!<eos> Stop!<eos> What are you doing?
And yet... many go hungry.<eos> I have cried out, "Why, God? "Why must the people who work the hardest suffer the most?"<eos> It is because Queen Mary is a spoiled French girl who does not care.<eos> She and her church take your tithes and spend it on clothes and outlandish luxuries.<eos> While she gets fatter, you starve.
Because OffKey sends an alert anytime a new device is detected, and Mrs. Chandler didn't get one that night.<eos> So she says.<eos> And you guys are basing your entire case on this app thing.<eos> Not at all. We find Mr. Pay Phone, and it's game over.<eos> Well, lucky for me, I get paid either way, but you better find your missing hitman soon, 'cause the clock is ticking.
You really are getting to know me, aren't you?<eos> I sure am.<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> You guys told me to stay away from you.
Yeah, I was.<eos> But you know me.<eos> I go where the work is. You go where the cameras are.<eos> Yeah, they're often in the same place.<eos> Look, I want a conviction as much as you do.
Hell, that's what you would do.<eos> You've destroyed more people, taken more lives, ended more families than anyone who's ever lived.<eos> All because you can.<eos> But here's the other truth.<eos> Despite being raised by you people... I am nothing like any of you.
All because you can.<eos> But here's the other truth.<eos> Despite being raised by you people... I am nothing like any of you.<eos> In fact, I'm proud as hell I'm not a Mikaelson.<eos> I beat you all without turning into you.
My name is "I'm black and I'm proud."<eos> What's your name?<eos> Okay, my name is Officer Kim Burgess, and this is a crime scene, so if you know something and you can help us in some way...<eos> Help you? They are killing our daughters, and you're asking me for my help?<eos> - You're the police!
Okay, my name is Officer Kim Burgess, and this is a crime scene, so if you know something and you can help us in some way...<eos> Help you? They are killing our daughters, and you're asking me for my help?<eos> - You're the police!<eos> - Ma'am, I need you to calm...<eos> No... you're supposed to be helping us!
Who knows what he would have done after? I don't care how many times<eos> I ran across him prior to that night.<eos> That's what he tried to do.<eos> And I defended myself.<eos> And then I ran. And I keep telling you guys that, but you don't care.
Travis, Zoey's mom said the two of you were having problems.<eos> That's not true.<eos> We were gonna get married.<eos> Her mom said Zoey was breaking up with you.<eos> What are you talking about?
That's not true.<eos> We were gonna get married.<eos> Her mom said Zoey was breaking up with you.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Why are you even here?
All right, well, there's a snack room upstairs.<eos> Let me know if you need quarters.<eos> So you threw a Molotov cocktail into a church... in front of a hundred cops?<eos> I'm not sure you really thought that one through.<eos> Well, I was trying to do what you wouldn't do, which is get them out of there.
Guys, all this food here is fresh.<eos> It's like Goldilocks just left.<eos> Yeah, maybe not.<eos> Erin, get these plates to forensics for prints.<eos> You're gonna bed down here.
It's designed that way in case the hydrazine blew.<eos> What?<eos> We have a bomb.<eos> Wait a second.<eos> The end of the world is coming, and you want to destroy the one thing that'll keep our people alive?
An ingredient I haven't seen before, which makes the poison undetectable.<eos> Are you scared of the female of the species?<eos> The praying mantis does come to mind.<eos> We're complex creatures.<eos> Where you use your swords, we use our wiles and potions.
How did you afford that?<eos> - It was only $2,000. - Huh.<eos> Judge Thompson, from the club, - got me into a police auction. - Huh.<eos> If I had 40 more dollars, you'd be looking at a speedboat.<eos> So, what do you think?
Not relevant.<eos> Burrows is always following the director about with that briefcase.<eos> It's not very subtle.<eos> What aren't you telling us, general?<eos> You two do not want to get into this right now with me.
- You're getting all Gollum-y again.<eos> - Well, that's ... that's what the Darkhold does to you ... it drives you mad.<eos> Yeah, maybe you should tell them where the book is.<eos> Let it drive them mad.<eos> I am the captain of this ship, and you are my prisoners.
Welcome to the inside of my mind, Sheeple.<eos> You guys watching any, uh, any good programming lately?<eos> You know why they call it "programming," right?<eos> Because you're being programmed through little screens, big screens, little morphine drips of sequels and prequels and zombies and Kanyes,<eos> Snapchats and Grumpy Cats, all designed by the media, corporate S.H.I.E.L.D. machine, and you're asleep, binge-watching the Apocalypse!
More of a friend...<eos> A co-worker, really.<eos> Though, to be honest,<eos> I'm starting to feel some tension, sexual and otherwise, so I was actually thinking about taking a shot, but I'm afraid it could go south.<eos> You Americans, you talk too much.
Pretty cool, right?<eos> And here, he makes his own soap.<eos> - How about that.<eos> - I do.<eos> - You should, too.
Never say, "You can't stop me," 'cause the minute you do...<eos> Well, yeah.<eos> That.<eos> I missed it, didn't I?<eos> You two together, and we missed it. Damn.
And we have each other. (horse whinnies, Humble surroundings for a king.<eos> What is<eos> Charles doing here?<eos> I have no idea, but it's a step up from the cave.<eos> You, there!
There's a seat here.<eos> Right there.<eos> They were dirty women.<eos> They were sluts.<eos> But you are special girls.
Listen to your hearts, men.<eos> Ask yourselves,<eos> "Is this really the right thing to do?"<eos> Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize this was ladies' night!<eos> Now, I got a bunch of money. You got a bunch of guns.
Now, girls.<eos> Soon you will be leaving us for new homes, a new family.<eos> And they won't judge you for your looks, or your clothes, or your ability to sound clever.<eos> Take your hands out of your mouth!<eos> They will love you for the blessing only you can provide.
Julian, I don't even want to imagine what they're doing to Laura right now.<eos> But it'll be worse if you don't get there before Connor.<eos> Stall him as long as you can.<eos> If the kidnappers don't realize who she is, we have a chance.<eos> What are you doing?
Guys.<eos> You figure Black Badge will provide medication on their end?<eos> Not a chance.<eos> - What do they care if Dolls devolves now?<eos> - Guys! What are you talking about?
Agent Lucado, the contracts, please.<eos> You want us to sign in blood?<eos> It's how it's done.<eos> How it's always been done.<eos> Who are you people?
You arrogant pricks.<eos> All right.<eos> Steady, mate.<eos> Six months of surveillance down the drain.<eos> We're building a case against some major players and you blew it out of the water!
Get the serial numbers for the 500 quid George Collins withdrew, cross-reference those.<eos> It's all right, Mrs Phillips.<eos> If you could just nod for us, is this your grandson, Eddie Phillips?<eos> You bastards!<eos> - You've done this to him.
- Both of you, shut up.<eos> Right, gents.<eos> I've got teams of Uniforms briefed and ready to go and hunt Clifford and David Bentley.<eos> I suggest you make yourselves useful and join 'em.<eos> What do you think?
- Excuse me?<eos> - We are making something really special... - Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.<eos> And we're gonna let you be part of it. See, there's always a Hispanic.<eos> You can be the Hispanic.<eos> What the fuck are you talking about?
I think the Almas has his initials tattooed on his wrist.<eos> I smell something.<eos> Almas?<eos> Yes, you know, ape-man.<eos> What do you people call it, hmm?
- My name is Lemony Snicket. - Dudy Damo...<eos> - It's my sad duty...<eos> - Democlay... to tell the tale of the Baudelaires' tragic lives.<eos> Dimoclath...<eos> But you likely have no such responsibilities...
- Yep, just like Santa.<eos> Keith would've thrown a Christmas banquet for Washington and his men.<eos> Secret mission on Christmas Eve.<eos> Congratulations, Mick, you just became a private in the U.S. Army.<eos> Nate, Amaya, you two will pose as wealthy newlyweds eager to make a contribution to the revolutionary cause.
- Listen to your gut, Captain.<eos> Don't abandon Ray.<eos> He may be sentimental, but the team should come before tactics.<eos> All right, let's do this.<eos> Guinevere's knights are not gonna able to last long against Damien Darhk's army unless you three...
But there's always room for a pretty little thing like you.<eos> We've got plenty of extra room in the brig.<eos> This is all in Rip's mind.<eos> None of this is real.<eos> You're not real.
I need to ask him where Nate's grandfather is.<eos> It won't be easy getting that information.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Eobard Thawne twisted his consciousness, turned friends into foes.<eos> But you're still a friend.
That's where you two come in.<eos> Perfect specimens.<eos> Not sure how much power I'm going to need.<eos> I might have to drain our little battery completely to pull it off.<eos> But you two are worth it.
She's a bad guy.<eos> That's enough!<eos> Come on!<eos> Stop!<eos> You two, go get them, I'll save Livewire.
All is clear on the Martian front.<eos> We were about to game plan some new tracking techniques.<eos> You're here.<eos> I want to help in any way that I can.<eos> I hate them even more than you do.
J'onn, I thought about what you said...<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Wait. If she's here and she...<eos> - Oh, no. - No. No.<eos> You Greens never learn, do you?
We need to search the building.<eos> How long until the reactor explodes?<eos> According to our calculations, about 15 minutes.<eos> Vasquez, Demos, you take two teams up through the north wing.<eos> Supergirl, Alex, you hit the basement.
And I need you to shut it down before the whole thing overloads.<eos> No. Damn it. No.<eos> I have to go to the reactor room.<eos> Then let's get to the reactor room.<eos> Hey, you two go. She's still a little out of it.
That is generally how these things work, yes.<eos> But don't throw away your shot, because you'll only get one.<eos> I only need one.<eos> Did you really think I would hand you a loaded gun that could actually kill me?<eos> You Daxamites really are thick, aren't you?
Yeah, GPS coordinates for everywhere this van has been.<eos> I know where Cadmus is.<eos> - Want me to go with you?<eos> - No, I gotta do it alone.<eos> I wish I had what you two have.
It is an artistic profession in the medium of preparing alcoholic beverages.<eos> And it is very honorable.<eos> I don't believe anyone in this hovel does anything important.<eos> That's lovely.<eos> Look, so, I don't wanna believe it, but I know it was you.
I'm the most powerful telepath in the Alcorian system.<eos> I know more than you can imagine.<eos> Oh, yeah, except for the difference between a gun and a stapler.<eos> You'll never get me to talk.<eos> You humans are too moral to do what's necessary to penetrate my mind.
I should let you do that.<eos> It has been great to see you.<eos> Have a good one, guys.<eos> My god. Are you serious?<eos> - What are you doing?
I think you already see a reflection of yourself in him.<eos> You want to find out what kind of hero you can be?<eos> Right here is a great place to start.<eos> We've been searching the city for signs of another attack, nothing yet.<eos> Have you two found anything?
You people are so predictable.<eos> - Hands above your head.<eos> - No. You made a mistake coming here.<eos> I find it as distasteful as you do, Supergirl, but I need your help.<eos> - And you need mine.
God, no.<eos> Jesus, Dad.<eos> We're in my house, son. There will be no nod to this Billie Jean King PC bullshit.<eos> - It's just wrong, you know? - No. Some things are just actually wrong.<eos> You two, not tonight, not the night before my IPO comes out.
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Oh, no.<eos> You Germans smoke a lot.
He'll never have to know.<eos> Why won't you tell me?<eos> What happens to her?<eos> If I jump... this all ends now.<eos> Me, you...
We have to find him, and I'll need all of my magic.<eos> And Elijah's been poisoned for some time, there's... a chance he won't survive the process.<eos> But I would survive. Klaus.<eos> If I'm the sacrifice, you can channel my death to imprison the Hollow before she kills Elijah.<eos> Yes, I'll be in the pendant, but the rest of you can find him, cure him, and bring him home. This is insane.
After all, your prize already belongs to me.<eos> Sofya, I know you're still in there.<eos> She is.<eos> Strong soul rattling around in a dying shell.<eos> But like all the rest of you, she's nothing compared to me.
♪<eos> Yes.<eos> Uh, James?<eos> Tommy.<eos> You sound tired.
Done.<eos> I just need to know where.<eos> Sandicot.<eos> Still waiting on the official decision to come out of committee, but they gave me the high sign, so I know it's a done deal.<eos> You casino guys are all old-line crooks.
She'll be shot, you know what they do.<eos> She know about this safe house?<eos> No. No reason to go after her.<eos> Just like that?<eos> I'm not risking any one of my agents who know what you know.
Stand up.<eos> Sam is the reason you all came here this week.<eos> He's your change.<eos> He's your inspiration.<eos> And now you're his new family.
Tulip, love, maybe you should give that place a rest.<eos> I got it. We're good.<eos> Hear that, Cass?<eos> He's got it. We're good.<eos> So, what are you boys doing, huh?
Uh...<eos> I, uh...<eos> Crane asked about Molly, you two have a little phone conversation and then you just show up here?<eos> ! Just let me explain.<eos> You two come into my life...
I'm an engineer.<eos> Touched by tragedy...<eos> - The money!<eos> - No! My friend has been shot.<eos> Where the hell are you people?
No, no, no, no.<eos> We are not playing the "murder everyone" game.<eos> We're playing my dance game.<eos> Did we lose a bet?<eos> I bring the Chinese food. You play my game.
Who's Devon?<eos> Uncurl the toes, please.<eos> Twelve.<eos> Open wide.<eos> So Mitch went to jail, and you and Topher struck it rich.
Hey, you want a cigarette?<eos> I stole it from a guard locker so... it ain't stale.<eos> Our mom used to smoke. And now she has a hole in her neck the size of a Ritz cracker.<eos> Ah, sucks... how we gotta do the work in here.<eos> Me behind the stove, you watching these sad fucks while everyone's outside getting a suntan.
Try to remember, you are federal inmates, not line cooks at Applebee's.<eos> Now there's a new shipment of produce out on the loading dock that is not gonna move itself.<eos> Rosado, Hernandez, bring the boxes back in, and you're done for the day.<eos> CO Samuelson will escort you back to your block.<eos> You guys should go along, too.
The women in here... and the guys out here.<eos> And their weaponry is a hell of a lot more punishing than anything a CO wears on his belt.<eos> What you see out there... is a shit ton of people who are also angry at you.<eos> We got the public on our side and hostages!<eos> What you got?
Come on, brother, breathe, breathe.<eos> Breathe, Mungo!<eos> Come on. Come on.<eos> Come on, bruh. Come on, brother. Come on.<eos> You bastards!
Fuck you, Nancy Reagan.<eos> - Give me that taco!<eos> - Hey, that's my taco!<eos> Get your own... Stop! No!<eos> What? That was my lunch and my dinner, you little assholes!
And it's not the agreement Wozniak signed onto.<eos> Then why don't we just call Gail Baker, see who the bigger prize to the FBI is?<eos> A crooked councilwoman or an enemy of the state who's already humiliated the Bureau once.<eos> I'd weigh my options if I were you, but you don't have anything to put on the scale.<eos> Except proof of the dirt that you and you and your crew has done that I can submit to the NYPD.
"Shades of Blue"...<eos> I told you a corrupt politician was gonna come to you asking you to let the mobster walk.<eos> You and your dirty cops were walking around breathing free air because you agreed to deliver that politician.
I can buy you five more minutes.<eos> I'm not talking without a lawyer.<eos> You're not gonna need a lawyer if you're dead.<eos> Start talking or bleed out.<eos> Yo, what are you doing?
You guys really need to expand your playbook.<eos> What's the charge this time?<eos> Double homicide.<eos> I can understand you killing your cleanup guy, but why the hell would you kill your mistress?<eos> She gave me up, and you killed her anyway?
That is what you two were doing, right?<eos> Arresting him?<eos> Interrupting investigations.<eos> Is that your way of procrastinating, or are you just playing for the other side?<eos> You go after criminals.
Now, this is not the way I like to build rapport.<eos> You are making a mistake.<eos> Ben, don't be a martyr.<eos> Be a hero.<eos> If we have Everclear, we'll use it to get the info we need painlessly, just like you did with Philip Brill.
Please?<eos> I love these.<eos> Have a Superstore day.<eos> $67.93.<eos> What are you doing?
Yes, well, this is a special case.<eos> Julia and I have a past.<eos> Handle it however you want, but for the record, that girl will be safer at Brakebills. Mm.<eos> "How to transfer the energy from one being" "and transform it."<eos> Hey, what... what are you two doing here?
The Nightblood solution will save everyone.<eos> I don't believe in miracles. It doesn't have to be like this.<eos> Yes, it does.<eos> The way I see it, you have two choices... tell your shooters to stand down, give us your ship, and use whatever time we have left to find your Nightblood solution, or tell them to open fire.<eos> We have more bullets than you have men.
- Cheers, bro.<eos> - Shut up.<eos> Well, your mate... that bosses everyone around is a dick.<eos> If you want to turn Sonny Castillo over, you're gonna need me. You're gonna need me in all the way.<eos> I can work this thing from the inside whilst you lot play silly safecrackers.
Double tequila shots all around.<eos> What are you doing here, Charlie?<eos> You're a long way from home, dog.<eos> International business, fellas.<eos> And you, you got your eye on anything?
Dailies, boys!<eos> As Hate 'Em said, it's gonna be a mindbender.<eos> What's the problem here, gents?<eos> What's the problem? Hoochin' the tea, you scumbag.<eos> Hoochin' what tea? What you talkin' about?
Not so much as a whisper.<eos> - Not a whisper.<eos> - No, nothing.<eos> - Quiet as a mouse.<eos> - I thought you two would know. Nothing to do with us.
Capisce?<eos> Mr. Hill, I was brought into this world without a home and without kin.<eos> After all manner of foster homes... a stint in Borstal and a stretch with the armed services.<eos> The Cavendish-Scotts, this, unique family became my adopted family.<eos> I will! Be careful, you bloody philistines!
I saw them duck into the alley last night after his set.<eos> No.<eos> They were out there for quite a while.<eos> Doing what?<eos> You tell me.
And you'd know...<eos> Mark is in a better place.<eos> Mark isn't gone.<eos> He's still here.<eos> It's you two who are dead.
Raping me... forcing my legs apart, holding me down... fucking me.<eos> - That's enough!<eos> - Night after night.<eos> Under your noses.<eos> And you did... nothin'.
You know he should be out of a job.<eos> And I know you made that call.<eos> You rang, boss?<eos> I need you to reach out to Boyd and set up a meeting.<eos> Just the two of you?
Nothing.<eos> Forget it.<eos> "There's still time"?<eos> There's still time for what?<eos> What are you doing?
- Yes, I could.<eos> A Cayenne Turbo is 120.<eos> A Cayenne Turbo is a proper car built by Porsche.<eos> This is two scrap cars glued together by a Muppet.<eos> It isn't designed for people like you.
It's OK, though.<eos> We anticipated that Nena may float away.<eos> We have a back-up plan.<eos> We'll activate it.<eos> You sit down.
Am I penetrating his bulletproof armour?<eos> Yes.<eos> And his food.<eos> Oh! That's my own urine!<eos> - Are you two doing this?
It's a tracer shell, so we'll be able to monitor its progress as it arcs toward the target.<eos> Oh, Commander Clarkson, this is fantastic!<eos> I can see him right there. Have you got him?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You bastards!
Save yourself!<eos> Catch it, James!<eos> Save it!<eos> Stop!<eos> What are you doing?
These chips will be your communicators and trackers once inside.<eos> Do not lose them.<eos> What kind of guns do we get?<eos> None. You get none guns.<eos> We do the bang-bang; you do the tech.
Which is why we can't afford any move that risks outing you.<eos> Most of those Killjoys, they're not "missing"; they're running.<eos> When you and Khlyen pissed in Arkyn's pool, you cut whatever hold the Hullen had on them, and bam, a whole whack of sleeper agents woke up, realized they'd been an alien parasite's bitch, and got the hells outta the Quad.<eos> When you say it like that, it does sound crazy.<eos> I will handle Oversight. You stick to warmongering.
Go on.<eos> Stay cool, guys.<eos> Look to the stars, for there they will orbit.<eos> What the hells is this?<eos> It's a celebration, and you are the guests of honor.
- All human.<eos> - Even Cardiff?<eos> Well, I guess even the Hullen have standards.<eos> Me and Fancy will keep the brass in line.<eos> You go kick some alien ass.
Not anymore.<eos> I had a hunch the dormant Blink Drive was emitting a subspace signal.<eos> The real question was identifying the specific signature so we could shield against it.<eos> Already done, so no help is coming.<eos> I don't need help to take out the likes of you.
No, man, he recognized us. I'm sure of it.<eos> I was able to find a local address under his name from an online directory.<eos> The address is 98 Gray Road.<eos> All right, Three and I will go check it out.<eos> You two stay here, keep an eye on him.
Given your reputation, I'd assumed you'd just assume cut our throats as save us.<eos> Guess it just goes to show how badly we wanna see this work.<eos> And if a bunch of... self-serving outlaws are willing to help your cause, maybe that could inspire you to make an effort.<eos> - It's not that simple.<eos> - While you and your buddies sit around a table arguing, people are dying.
- We might be able to break the code, but it'll take time.<eos> We don't have any more time.<eos> We were never gonna give it to them anyway.<eos> Arrange the meet.<eos> You two keep working.
We're sending a shuttle down to pick him up.<eos> I'm afraid that won't be possible, Raza.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - This colony's under lockdown, pending the arrival of corporate military reinforcements.<eos> While I appreciate your desire to keep the peace, I hope you can appreciate my desire to rescue a friend.
'Cause I can help you get one, but not both.<eos> So what do you suggest we do then?<eos> Go to talk to them.<eos> You're telling us to go over there, trust them not to shoot us on sight, and hope they're willing to talk?<eos> Not you.
You can dig in your heels and fight for a corporation that's abandoned you, or you can let me in to talk, and help reach a settlement.<eos> No fighting.<eos> No one dies.<eos> You get to go home to your families.<eos> Either way, this colony is declaring independence, and there's nothing you can do to change that.
He put himself at risk by going over there and trying to broker a deal with those bastards.<eos> Okay, everyone put your weapons down. Now!<eos> You show up out of nowhere, start telling us what to do.<eos> You have no idea what we've been through, risking our asses for a corporate bottom line.<eos> What do you know about it, huh?
I wanna help you save your friend.<eos> Plus, I have to show this guy up, so...<eos> Where the hell are all the guards?<eos> I don't like this.<eos> You guys take this hallway.
On the other hand...<eos> Got it?<eos> Yup.<eos> Beauties.<eos> What do you say we find ourselves a nice fat, juicy target and see what these babies can do?
Whatever happens, we must move quickly.<eos> What's happening?<eos> I told you you had to choose.<eos> Us or your job.<eos> It's you.
This is the neurotoxin affecting you.<eos> You are not thinking straight.<eos> Yeah, I'm aware of that.<eos> This is all in my head.<eos> You're all in my head.
It's very imperfect.<eos> I'll sort out what happened at the border when Jake gets back.<eos> Meanwhile, this is the safest place to live in a world gone mad.<eos> Most people would be damn grateful for being here.<eos> I had the idea you might be, too.
His son's a murderer!<eos> You want to go to war with them, huh? All of them?<eos> You want to start that fight? Then you'll see murder.<eos> You know it's my fault?<eos> I led Lucy and her people to that place, and you came there looking for me.
This is not my time to stop.<eos> Your father was always so proud of you.<eos> He told me how the two of you used to go free climbing in the Mariner Valley.<eos> No belay. No back-up air. No mech suits.<eos> Just you and the elements.
You have something better to do?<eos> Than running a car service for a murderer?<eos> Bogey.<eos> Two o'clock.<eos> You're here to transport my client?
So my company can't pick and choose who we provide service to.<eos> But isn't it a fact that users who issue death threats are violating the terms of their customer agreement?<eos> Maybe yes, maybe no.<eos> That's a contractual matter for us to decide.<eos> Not you.
You'd think at least one of them would be in.<eos> No.<eos> I don't see her anywhere.<eos> She's got to be somewhere.<eos> - What are you doing in here? - Oh, uh...
Uh... can y'all keep it down, please?<eos> I'm trying to set up my new wireless headphones.<eos> Gonna make my walkman sound amazing.<eos> This is ridiculous.<eos> I'm trying to keep things on the down-low, and you three went on the biggest shopping spree since Ellen at a Men's Wearhouse sale.
Look, I'm just saying. How many major banks have had their CEOs sent to fucking jail? Jail!<eos> It's a small list, isn't it?<eos> Spartan-Ives is tainted. A lot of shops don't want them walking through the door.<eos> I get the anti-them.<eos> What's the pro-you?
He's actually vaping alcohol. Ooh!<eos> It really enhances the flavor of the green fairy.<eos> Maybe you say "when," Wags.<eos> Apart from being able to smoke your beverages, how is this different from where we would have taken you?<eos> You would have brought us to a demeaning, run-of-the-mill titty bar.
She just got tired.<eos> One morning, she ate her cereal. She brushed her teeth for school.<eos> She took the gun out of her daddy's dresser.<eos> She shot him. Shot him while he slept off the night before.<eos> My mama looked at me then like you're looking at me now.
Alex, stop. Stop it. He's... he's helping.<eos> Idiot!<eos> Why didn't you get clear?<eos> You had to watch, huh?<eos> You two set off the bomb?
So how do we do it?<eos> Well, it boils down to objective versus stakes.<eos> Now, this is really just a fancy way of saying<eos> "want versus need."<eos> Now, you guys are scientists, you're epidemiologists, so your want might be to cure some unpronounceable, incurable disease.
- We're gonna try.<eos> All right people, listen up.<eos> We're going in hot.<eos> You, get BDU here right now.<eos> You two, come with me.
You two, come with me.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - Roger that.<eos> All right, guys, let's get things in motion.<eos> You two with me.
Well...<eos> Where is he?<eos> He's your son.<eos> He's never been as strong as you, you know that.<eos> You two have been...
Move.<eos> Ah, man.<eos> - C'mon! Let's go!<eos> - Okay. This way.<eos> Two of you, make sure one of the trucks is ready to go.
Yeah, we, um... we haven't watched the weather report in a while.<eos> So what brings you to Driggs?<eos> We're just, um... just heading up the mountain.<eos> - You take care now.<eos> - Okay, you, too.
Those racks are rigged with enough explosives to bring this whole place down.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> - Hey. We gotta find Erin before they do.<eos> You and me will find Erin.<eos> You guys, find the explosives.
Okay. And to make each other laugh every single day.<eos> - Mm-hmm. Do not. Don't you dare.<eos> You guys made some pretty big promises to each other.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> But if I trust anyone to keep them, it's the two of you.
Slide out of your chair and into the water, slowly.<eos> Watch him.<eos> He's making me nervous.<eos> Hey, David, I really need you to stay calm and, please, do not make me press this button.<eos> Who are you people?
- We get to go to New York?<eos> - I've always wanted to go to New York!<eos> Uh, no, no.<eos> Josh and I go to New York.<eos> You two will die here.
- You'd do that?<eos> Why?<eos> What if it's real?<eos> Your vision? What does that mean for my baby?<eos> If... if she is like you, it'd be the end for her too.
It seems our gang's becoming unglued faster than we predicted.<eos> Ok. Get the good beer.<eos> And no menthols this time.<eos> Yeah, sure thing.<eos> You, too, girls.
Jody was merely analog.<eos> I'd talk to her family and friends, get to really know who Jody Wilson was.<eos> Very good. Her mother Mae will be here in an hour.<eos> In the meantime, get to work.<eos> What are you two doing here?
- Can we live in reality for a second?<eos> We gotta shoot this thing in five weeks, most of you don't know how to act, none of you can wrestle.<eos> This is our way of making it so you don't suck, all right?<eos> And because of that, we're instituting a curfew, and a strict no-drug policy.<eos> You guys did blow all weekend, and we have to live like nuns?
Why?<eos> Because Dr. Eldredge is already pissed you're here.<eos> You're doing fancy, expensive surgery.<eos> Special treatment gets the others all riled up, you know.<eos> Eldredge pushes you, you push back.
- I'm Louie's father...<eos> And I want him back.<eos> The paperwork on Louie said there was no known father.<eos> So where did this Andre Keyes come from?<eos> I don't know any more than you do.
No, I know that, but I can handle this.<eos> My parents, my sisters, they all wanna be a part of it, to bring this boy back to our family.<eos> Just forget about the guardianship stuff for now, that's for the courts, but you understand, I want to meet my son.<eos> Talk to him, get to know him.<eos> You, DCFS, whoever can be there the whole time.
I'm gonna kill you, Westcott.<eos> I'm gonna torture you and kill you and defile your pathetic, little corpse.<eos> You don't decide shit!<eos> You don't tell me a goddamn thing!<eos> I'm the King of England and you're all just people.
To observe.<eos> Who? How many?<eos> Defenses? Not just military.<eos> They have their own special help.<eos> People like you.
Hurry up.<eos> It's log day.<eos> I hate log days.<eos> Now grab a debarker and start debarking.<eos> You too, lumber midgets.
You know, it's so hard to tell you guys apart.<eos> Is that Roger?<eos> Where are they?<eos> Better run.<eos> You two... take him to Olivia.
No! Don't!<eos> He has schizophrenia.<eos> He doesn't?<eos> Amy, didn't you once tell your husband it felt like you grew up in a haunted house?<eos> - How do you...
He hasn't called.<eos> I promise, if I knew anything...<eos> I'm not a tough... a tough person.<eos> You can ask anybody.<eos> So this, you, the leeches...
He died?<eos> He built this place with Cary 30 years ago.<eos> Before the Divisions.<eos> Before anyone knew ‭how fast the world would change.<eos> They built it, ‭and they went looking for people like you to fill it.
What did the stars say?<eos> Interesting.<eos> Memories within memories.<eos> Why say that?<eos> Did you...
Off to the big party? Left you on your own?<eos> You and your colleagues gave brigadefuhrer faber a good ru.<eos> Just blew up a bridge.<eos> Knocked off a tank or two.<eos> Nothing compared to what you lot get up to.
It was all your crazy idea to begin with.<eos> Space?<eos> Uh, we don't have enough fuel to get down.<eos> Sounds like a 5-year problem to me.<eos> You're talking about the ring.
Yes.<eos> If she can do it, so can we.<eos> Raven, we'll never make it back to Polis on time, and the radios are dead.<eos> We have something better than radios... the satellite tower.<eos> You three, back in the cockpit. Finish those restraints.
If she can do it, so can we.<eos> Raven, we'll never make it back to Polis on time, and the radios are dead.<eos> We have something better than radios... the satellite tower.<eos> You three, back in the cockpit. Finish those restraints.<eos> You two, helmets on. You're with me.
We got him!<eos> - Get it out of here now. - Go!<eos> Go! Go! Go!<eos> - Go! Move! - Move, move, move, move!<eos> Go! - Go, go! - You and you, that way!
Jane was... Jane is loyal.<eos> So, Tasha, I want you to put out a APB.<eos> I want every cop in the tri-state area searching for...<eos> Please, I just need to see if they're okay! Hey, stop!<eos> What are you two doing?
The resident?<eos> Start to finish, baby!<eos> Oh, would you quit bragging already?<eos> Yes!<eos> I don't get it. Why you two?
You know, the thing is, - I was good at that job.<eos> - Mm-hmm. I like doing that stuff... the admin work, the scheduling.<eos> Meredith doesn't even like it.<eos> You know, I want you to see the Avery Trauma Center in Chicago.<eos> They do things very differently than you do here.
That's not really a good idea, Jim. He's not out of the woods yet.<eos> I'd really like him to rest so we can go back in tomorrow.<eos> Right now you guys should just get some food, get some rest yourselves.<eos> No. We aren't going anywhere.<eos> Tell you what... you guys stay here, and I'll bring us in some food.
We're doing this now?<eos> Okay.<eos> It's awesome.<eos> Hi!<eos> Why are you all here at once? - Hi!
As new associates, you can be fired at any time, and many of you will be.<eos> Look at the person next to you. They are your competitor.<eos> Do better than them or you're gone.<eos> This is not lawyer camp.<eos> We are not here to help you learn. You are here to help us.
- Miss Lucca Quinn.<eos> - Yes?<eos> Would you accompany us, please?<eos> Why?<eos> What are you doing?
See that?<eos> This is why I'm here, Diane.<eos> I just have a bunch of old-fart, white guys who don't know how to fight.<eos> That's why I'm thinking about coming here.<eos> You guys know how to fight.
No. No! No quarantine!<eos> No, not you... the O.R.<eos> No one new's coming in until it gets fumigated.<eos> Okay, well, what happens with Patient Zero in there?<eos> He gets heavy antibiotics in an isolation recovery room, and you two get to go get PPD tests.
I've got less than a year left.<eos> It's okay.<eos> "Inoperable" means different things to different surgeons.<eos> I-I've seen six surgeons. So I know the stages.<eos> You guys are in Stage 1. You see it, your eyes light up, you're the only ones who can tame it.
What is going on out there?<eos> Is anybody coming?<eos> The military?<eos> Police?<eos> We hoped you knew.
How do you want to do this?<eos> We avoid the people inside.<eos> From what that Vic guy said, we don't want any part of that.<eos> I'll find them.<eos> You guys can do a supply run.
- For the murder of Steven Mason.<eos> Hey, stop!<eos> This is a mistake.<eos> - You have the right to remain silent...<eos> - What are you doing?
They're laughing at us outside.<eos> We need to strike back.<eos> No!<eos> No, he's not a cop.<eos> He's a negotiator, and he wants the same thing you want... for everybody to go home alive.
I watched several of Mr. McDonald's videos in preparation for this event.<eos> Found them rather mundane.<eos> Tell me about it.<eos> Diatribes on acne, dating, gossip, lip gloss.<eos> You guys don't get it.
Don't do that!<eos> Don't...<eos> Looks like it retards flames.<eos> Uh, so much for that lead.<eos> What do you think you're doing?
Oh, hey, Poodle.<eos> Hey, it's me, Mickey, again.<eos> Uh, remember me?<eos> The one you saddled with your kids, who are awful, by the way.<eos> Listen, I was just... I had this thought that maybe if you had a couple spare minutes, you could give 'em a call and let them know that you fled the country and left them with a total stranger, you stupid, selfish monsters!
I'm so, I'm so sorry.<eos> Let me make it right.<eos> How is that for a scene?<eos> Dinner and a show!<eos> Lap it up, you dogs!
Now, it has been a long day, so why don't we all go upstairs and change into our PJs?<eos> Yeah, sorry, Grandma, that's not gonna work for me.<eos> I've got a party to go to tonight.<eos> And I probably won't get home until late, so, you know what, don't wait up for me.<eos> I realize you children aren't used to having rules, but all that's going to change.
I was gonna go make a grilled cheese. - What are you doing?<eos> - I'm going out.<eos> What if Grandma wakes up?<eos> Well, you can tell her to eat a big fat...<eos> And where might you two be going?
Get in.<eos> What the hell?<eos> Oh, I'm sorry, were you watching that?<eos> Is that why you were too busy to remember you little brothers' birthday?<eos> - Oh, yikes. - ‭Ay bendito. I mean, at least I'm new around here, you're his siblings.
I replaced them with all the ones under Poodle's sink.<eos> You hand a guy something like this, he just starts throwing cash at you, no questions asked.<eos> I like to call it the $600 shuffle.<eos> Yeah, now I just feel depressed.<eos> What are you two doing? Oh, us?
Well, this is just fan-frickin-tastic!<eos> Well, it is not what it looks like.<eos> No. I don't care.<eos> Smoke 'em up.<eos> As far as I'm concerned, you can all get cancer.
Smoke 'em up.<eos> As far as I'm concerned, you can all get cancer.<eos> - Oh, easy!<eos> - Too hard, Chip.<eos> While you zeroes are in here getting high on cigarettes,
- Got it.<eos> And, Ben, I want you to have something.<eos> If you ever need to talk to me, just use this and I'll be there.<eos> Bye, Omicron.<eos> You folks... take care... of yourselves.
To ensure some serious stink sours his mood.<eos> I know all the babies.<eos> I know you do.<eos> Mm. Oh, my god.<eos> What are you feeding that thing?
Ansel is clearly wielding dark magic.<eos> Your men do not stand a chance against him.<eos> Hazards of the job.<eos> But no one... forced these gentlemen to sign up to be security guards.<eos> Listen, you're... you're free to wait it out here.
"There is no place like home."<eos> You said you have some maps for me?<eos> Yes, indeed.<eos> This way, Miss Alex.<eos> While you two get busy with the topography, I'll, take a look around for info on ley line interference.
Girl, you so have a type.<eos> Very good.<eos> Miss Jenny, if you pursue that lead, agent Thomas and I will reconnoiter the scene at the Eisenhower building.<eos> We will search for clues as to the monster's whereabouts, and Dreyfuss' endgame.<eos> You two, on me.
Sorry to crash the party.<eos> Mm. Yeah, we were just leaving.<eos> No, please, uninvited but not unwanted guests.<eos> Mr. Dreyfuss has some questions about the current whereabouts of a very powerful and ancient firearm.<eos> And you... are gonna tell us where it is.
Well, what do you know?<eos> You're a bit ahead of schedule, aren't you?<eos> Stand down, Dreyfuss.<eos> Not another step, demon.<eos> You people.
Mick, Mick, Mick, when have we ever destroyed anything we've ever stolen, let alone the most valuable score in the universe?<eos> What have they done to you?<eos> How the hell are we supposed to find anyone in here?<eos> - I said, how the hell are we sup...<eos> On your feet, you lazy good-for-nothings, or I'll have you shot!
- That's it.<eos> Now, did that feel like a hallucination?<eos> I must be hallucinating.<eos> Actually, we took the liberty of curing your typhoid fever, Lieutenant Tolkien.<eos> You.
Somewhere the less talked about, the better,<eos> - for your sake.<eos> - But we're on your side, and we need your help.<eos> In your paper, "The Burden of the Purest Heart," you described the final resting place of Sir Gawain.<eos> I never actually published that paper... how did you...?
Volumes of what, Professor?<eos> I think what Martin is trying to say is that he's worried that, if it came down to a decision between Leonard and us...<eos> You would choose Snart in a heartbeat.<eos> Yeah, I would.<eos> He's a friend, and you guys ain't exactly being friendly right now.
An addendum to Emilio's will?<eos> _<eos> _<eos> I knew I was right to be worried about the money.<eos> And you guys thought I was shallow.
Richard, you don't have to name everyone you know.<eos> Point is... you all thought I was crazy when I walked into the swimming pool with my clothes on, but it turns out I was fucking right.<eos> Okay. So, not crazy.<eos> Opposite.<eos> You poor idiots.
German intelligence can't prove anything yet, which is why he's under surveillance round the clock.<eos> So the CIA is gonna exfiltrate him from Germany before they make the connection?<eos> Not the CIA.<eos> You.<eos> You. All of you.
Was, Booth.<eos> Where'd he go?<eos> You can't exfiltrate someone you can't find.<eos> So, who's gonna get to me first?<eos> You or them?
I'll get him.<eos> Do you have a pregnancy test laying around by chance?<eos> I think so.<eos> Also having severe baby anxiety...<eos> What the hell are you doing here? !
Don't mention it.<eos> "Deactivate your organic component."<eos> All the suits got the same command.<eos> - Best guess, someone hacked the network.<eos> - And you survived how?
To protect a muddy little hillside, you doomed your whole world.<eos> One man. You think one man can save us all?<eos> Come and meet him.<eos> He came here to meet you.<eos> He's met loads of people like you - the terrified, the desperate.
Yes.<eos> It's me. Something to do with the TARDIS, maybe?<eos> Telepathic field?<eos> So now that we all understand each other, how do we all sound?<eos> You sound like children. You sound like children, too.
Kenny is.<eos> So much for staying strong, Paul.<eos> Uh, dude, what's with the eye?<eos> Just errant elbow in a pick-up game.<eos> What are you two doing here?
We'll have one in the basement.<eos> En route.<eos> Ninety seconds out.<eos> One in the Van, spotting.<eos> And you three in the bar.
Smug.<eos> Pleased with himself.<eos> King of the world.<eos> Yeah?<eos> What do you know?
- Yeah.<eos> Listen, there's no good way to ask this so I'm just gonna put it up there.<eos> Okay.<eos> Liv?<eos> Hey, you dead bitches!
You must be so tired.<eos> I am. I really am.<eos> Well, I guess you won't mind if I call up Ethan.<eos> You're not calling Ethan.<eos> How did you two meet?
Uh, maybe put a bag of frozen peas on it and keep it elevated.<eos> purely recreational sex, and your response is frozen produce?<eos> Yes.<eos> I mean, no.<eos> Dude, she was good to go, and you refused because your orange junk?
Aren't they gonna notice that they're missing 60 gallons of coconut milk at your restaurant?<eos> Oh, I'm bringing it back.<eos> So, uh, you gonna go for it with Billie?<eos> Would I be ass-deep in coconut milk if I wasn't?<eos> Aren't you supposed to be at work?
I'm sure he's fancy.<eos> Oh, my God, I'm such a tool.<eos> I blew it.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> You like her.
You okay?<eos> You're injured.<eos> You're not the same.<eos> Hey, it's just a robot!<eos> Your skin deserves the best, so do you.
A message was left at each of the crime scenes by someone identifying himself... as Kuze.<eos> Collaborate with Hanka Robotics and be destroyed.<eos> Collaborate with Hanka Robotics and be destroyed.<eos> Togusa.<eos> You and Ladriya go speak to Mr. Cutter, the CEO of Hanka.
It feels like there's always this thick fog over my memory and I can't seen through it.<eos> You're lucky.<eos> Every single day, I get screwed by my memories.<eos> It's better to be pure.<eos> Like you.
I can see you out there, you know.<eos> How many fingers am I holding up?<eos> Funny.<eos> Say something nice.<eos> You chose those?
- What else I got?<eos> - They suit you.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> I got night vision,...* and X-ray.<eos> I guess I see like you now.
Is it a tall building?<eos> It's a tall place, right?<eos> You don't have a child.<eos> You don't have a wife.<eos> You live alone, just you.
Connecting.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Come here.<eos> I'm shy.*<eos> I'm not beautiful... like you.
Reading y-y-your code... when you were inside that geisha.<eos> Like nothing I had felt before, yet so... familiar.<eos> We are the same.<eos> We're not the same.<eos> You kill innocent people.
What have they told you?<eos> That you were the first?<eos> The first cerebral salvage.<eos> You were born of lessons they took from my failure.<eos> What are you talking about?
Nothing I have is real.<eos> I found him.<eos> I told you to be careful.<eos> You knew who he was the whole time.<eos> You built him.
Hanka security will hunt her from here.<eos> - What are the orders?<eos> - To terminate on sight.<eos> You want to kill her?<eos> You built her!
That's why he's coming... for Hanka.<eos> Kuze was one of them. Can you prove this?<eos> Dr. Ouelet can.<eos> Ouelet's dead.<eos> Cutter says you killed her.
It's Cutter, he found us!<eos> Target acquired<eos> No!<eos> Target eliminated.<eos> You came close... you freak.
And us, we the people, ended up losing both.<eos> While everybody else is stuck on the ground, we're doing shit on the board nobody's ever even seen before.<eos> Well, that's my pitch.<eos> I always was a better spy than a salesman.<eos> So, what do you say?
There's only rebels and tyrants now.<eos> So, which are you?<eos> I'm Triple-X.<eos> Well, welcome back, Triple-X.<eos> Uh, where are you going?
And I'm not talking about the first Terminator, but the second Terminator that goes back to kill the first Terminator.<eos> It was the liquidy metal guy.<eos> Agent Clearidge worked closely with Gibbons.<eos> She'll handle support for the operation.<eos> And I bet a guy like you needs a lot of support.
No.<eos> We're not all jacked up on Mountain Dew and Red Bull, you asshole.<eos> Where'd you find this guy?<eos> Well, there's a first time for everything.<eos> What did you just do?
You know, the men who come to this island, they're on the run.<eos> Hiding from the world.<eos> But not you.<eos> You're not here to hide.<eos> You're looking for someone.
Okay, I actually have what you want.<eos> Pandora's Box?<eos> I got it right here.<eos> But you're wrong, though.<eos> You take it from me, and you die first.
This isn't about Serena.<eos> This is war.<eos> And either we stop it today, or we watch the world burn tomorrow.<eos> - Can't lose focus on that.<eos> Where you been?
Officially, you're deranged.<eos> Cool.<eos> We'll set up a triangulated signal tracking system around the city.<eos> And when Becky locks in his exact location, we make our move.<eos> What about you?
Stole my dance partner.<eos> I'm gonna crash yours.<eos> Have fun.<eos> This ain't a party. This is a race.<eos> What the hell you think you're doing?
Read between the lines.<eos> Isn't it right?<eos> I'm gonna be honest with you.<eos> What's been bugging me this whole time is you've got something stuck in between your teeth.<eos> What the hell are you talking about?
- I've got a plan!<eos> - No!<eos> No, no, no!<eos> Listen!<eos> From now on, I make the plans, you execute!
Andy, is that you?
Martha, he's my brother and I love him, but, ultimately, it's gonna come down to how bad he wants to save himself.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> Why are you crying, Mommy?<eos> I'm sorry, Martha.<eos> You and Sally deserve better than this. I mean that.
No, not at all.<eos> Get in the back, you fat fuckin' bastard.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> That's real nice. That's real nice. You're a nice little girl.<eos> You know, I'm a police officer just like you.
Yeah, I, uh.<eos> Stephanie Burton called, said that Ed came and went.<eos> So he just came back here to get his clothes?<eos> - He wanted me to go with him.<eos> - And you said no?
- He wanted me to go with him.<eos> - And you said no?<eos> - I said no.<eos> - You expect us to believe that?<eos> Ed shows up here with $3 million in cash, and you just tell him to get lost?
No, no, not the same as us because he's the one that ended up with all the money.<eos> Right, well, he wants to settle up, split the cash, and then we all go our separate ways.<eos> Well.<eos> I can't go nowhere until after I meet up with Andy at ten.<eos> No, Chris, just you.
Adiós.<eos> - Chris!<eos> - Steph?<eos> - Over here.<eos> - Is that you?
I always figured you sorta hated me on account of what happened to Ed Jr.<eos> That was an accident.<eos> Put your gun down, Chris.<eos> Relax.<eos> Who the hell are you?
You killed him.<eos> You provoked him!<eos> Why did you provoke him?<eos> Just making sure.<eos> - You manipulative little sh. - Focus, Judge.
- You're obviously doing something.<eos> - It's a. It's a surprise.<eos> That'll be the day.<eos> - Are you all right, dear?<eos> You're shaking.
- I was at work!<eos> - So was I!<eos> At a drug lab! And you killed my son!<eos> You don't scare me, Ed.<eos> You only kill people by accident.
What about tomorrow you and me, we go to Funland?<eos> She's got school tomorrow.<eos> You don't want to skip school and spend the day with your dad?<eos> - Can Lissa come? - No, Lissa can't come.<eos> No, it's just you and me.
Chris, Chris. Everything's gonna be fine.<eos> - Okay? Isn't that right, Andy?<eos> - Five minutes.<eos> Easy in, easy out.<eos> You don't even have to leave your car.
Easy in, easy out.<eos> You don't even have to leave your car.<eos> Yeah, well, why are we taking my car anyway?<eos> Because everyone knows I drive a bitchin' Camaro and Andy drives a gay-ass Porsche.<eos> No one has the slightest clue as to what you drive. That's why.
Yeah. I guess people really don't like dead kids, huh?<eos> Yeah, no shit.<eos> They fucking love 'em.<eos> We had some pretty good times back in the day.<eos> You and me.
- Justice, Ed. - Justice.<eos> Justice for what?<eos> We couldn't just let you get away with it.<eos> Not you. Not Chris Morrow. Not Andy Sikes.<eos> He wasn't dead two weeks and you were already cutting a deal.
Come on.<eos> He was my baby too, okay?<eos> Don't you get it?<eos> He wasn't your baby.<eos> What are you talking about?
Why am I saying it the way someone who was just invited to the wedding... of the child of a guy he barely knows would say it?<eos> We're going.<eos> This place will be fine without us for a weekend.<eos> No. Not going.<eos> Jerry, you're the president of idiots.
I'll see you in there.<eos> Hi. Hey.<eos> You're here. That's c...<eos> Why are you here?<eos> Same as you.
- Bina and Jerry Kepp.<eos> - Right.<eos> And I'm Walter, just a successful businessman who just likes to read his favorite book.<eos> That one.<eos> And you're Grotsky's friend's kid?
It started after we broke up and you dropped out as maid of honor.<eos> How does a guy who... After two years, you break up with me over text?<eos> "Good luck with your future endeavors"?<eos> Were you firing me? What the f...<eos> You're an asshole.
I don't have a ferry ticket till tomorrow, anyway.<eos> Swim.<eos> Think she'll be back?<eos> I vote yes.<eos> Let's chat, you and me.
I know how hard that can be, okay?<eos> A long time ago, he broke up with me to go out with you, so I get it.<eos> But you have to stop now.<eos> I fit into this family.<eos> You never did.
Oh. Well.<eos> I'd probably say this corner right here is where I'd go for that.<eos> Ugh. I'm drunk, Teddy.<eos> Please don't let me make a fool of myself.<eos> Mom, you could never make a fool of yourself.
It was lovely to dance with you.<eos> How did I not just get kissed?<eos> It happens more often than you think.<eos> Uh... I'm Eloise, by the way.<eos> Who are you?
Oh, seriously?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, God, you're not somebody's date in there, are you?<eos> No.<eos> Because you're not at a table.
No, I... Not like that.<eos> Yes, you did.<eos> You said I'd be a ridiculous father.<eos> You asked me if I wanted to keep it.<eos> Then I asked you if you would want to keep it and you didn't say anything to that.
And you were looking for a way out, man!<eos> I get that now.<eos> Everyone we know says we were wrong together.<eos> Your mother wouldn't stop saying that I was not the kind of girl who ended up with you.<eos> And when it was time for you to stand up and say that she's wrong and they're all wrong and they're idiots and stand by me, then you ask me if I want to keep it.
I'm smoking the reefer.<eos> Who smokes pot? Are you a potter?<eos> - No.<eos> - No?<eos> You're a pothead.
Was there ever a time you would have done that for me?<eos> Just, like, shout out across a lake at me, in front of a bunch of strangers, about how you really felt about me?<eos> We shout at each other in front of strangers all the time.<eos> I'll take that as a no.<eos> Would you do that for me?
Look at this.<eos> Baby cakes.<eos> Talk to the angels.<eos> It's one o'clock in the morning and you're wide awake.
But you've helped me realize something.<eos> I can't leave you.<eos> I once knew a boy who thought he could hear his dead sister through the teeth of an old comb.<eos> He would sit with it for hours, listening and whispering his secrets.<eos> He was as sure of what he heard as you are.
All right. I'm sorry. We're fine.<eos> You're crazy!<eos> We're freakin' fine.<eos> Go ahead and say we're through.<eos> I don't care, I'll just get another you
You're crazy!<eos> We're freakin' fine.<eos> Go ahead and say we're through.<eos> I don't care, I'll just get another you<eos> I'll get another dude that look like you
Baes!<eos> What are you doing? What do you think you're doing?<eos> Fart's house is actually kinda nice.<eos> If I had known, I would have stopped calling him Danny DeVito all year.<eos> Sam and you.
Excuse me?<eos> You heard me.<eos> You're a goddamn fetid bitch just like your mother.<eos> It's no wonder Daddy left.<eos> - You're a bitch, too. - What? You're a drunk.
You heard me.<eos> You're a goddamn fetid bitch just like your mother.<eos> It's no wonder Daddy left.<eos> - You're a bitch, too. - What? You're a drunk.<eos> And you... You're just pathetic.
Sorry.<eos> I was FaceTiming with Patrick till, like, 3:00.<eos> Speaking of which, are you nervous for tonight?<eos> What?<eos> You, Rob, his flannel sheets?
Watch this.<eos> You're a bitch!<eos> Just like your mother.<eos> No wonder Daddy left. Huh?<eos> - You're a bitch, too. - What? You're a drunk.
Maybe I was dead and in hell.<eos> Maybe I was alive and in hell.<eos> But it didn't matter.<eos> Nothing mattered anymore.<eos> What are you wearing?
You're the horrible driver.<eos> You're the one always criticizing people and hurting people.<eos> You're the one who lied about being friends with her and then tortured her for all these years.<eos> I just followed along and yet... I'm the one paying for it.<eos> Sam, what are you talking about?
It was really sweet what you did today.<eos> Do you think I'm a good person?<eos> Of course I think you're a good person.<eos> But it doesn't really matter what I think.<eos> I mean, what's important is what you think.
Well, do you remember in third grade right after my dad died?<eos> We were in the cafeteria and I was crying, and Phil Howe came up to me, called me a baby, and then smacked my tray right out of my hand, and food went flying everywhere.<eos> I remember what we were eating, too.<eos> It was, um, mashed potatoes and turkey burgers.<eos> And you came over, you scooped up the mashed potatoes right off the ground and you went up to Phil and you smashed the mashed potatoes right in his face.
I meant everything that happened back there.<eos> That's all I can say, that I meant it, and I wish it hadn't taken me so long.<eos> Sam, are you in trouble?<eos> You can trust me.<eos> You can trust me back.
Push, Jerzyk!<eos> Push!<eos> Oh, she's breathing!<eos> Oh! She's breathing!<eos> You beauty!
No one enters the ghetto without a pass.<eos> Listen, there are people I know, people trying to help.<eos> They have trucks, they have guns.<eos> And they want to use the zoo as a way station.<eos> What do you mean?
I am here with a house full of desperate people, and he comes here and he frightens me, and you're not here.<eos> And there's nothing I can do.<eos> You're not here.<eos> People are dying, Antonina.<eos> Thousands of people are dying. And you are here.
You don't know.<eos> Grandparents, women, children.<eos> The littlest of children.<eos> And I'm trying to help them, but they're dying in my hands.<eos> And you don't know.
Look at this little guy.<eos> Bet it's worth a couple bucks.<eos> Yeah, it was a knockout in the second round.<eos> I lost everything. Hang tight, guy.<eos> - Now, you're buying this time.
I want everything just the way I like it.<eos> Spick-and-span.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I'm the boss. That's why.<eos> I'm the boss man, and you're the boss dog.
-I am so sick of the way you look at me. -It's okay, Ethan.<eos> - It's okay. - Just relax.<eos> Relax. -Look at how you look at me.<eos> -What are you doing? -This has nothing to do with him. -Stay out of it.<eos> -You stay out of it! What are you doing?
Andinoneof hisbadmoods,too .<eos> Icouldsmellit.<eos> Hey, dad.<eos> Hey, pal.<eos> What are you, uh... What are you doing here?
You, um... do you want to go to the pond?<eos> I made some sandwiches.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I mean...<eos> Yeah, if you want.
-You ready?<eos> -Iamready.<eos> You know what I'm thinking?<eos> Icecream.<eos> It's ridiculous, but sometimes I actually think you know what I'm thinking.
Youreadmy mind.<eos> I think this is it, tino.<eos> I think it's just gonna be you and me.<eos> I-i don't know. It's fine, right?<eos> Because I love you and you love me, and... Love is all that matters.
Do you want to go?<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> Iwasbackinthefront seat.<eos> Okay, buddy.<eos> Guess it's gonna be you and me.
Hmm. Wait.<eos> That'sfamiliar.<eos> Ismelled...me .<eos> What do you got there?<eos> Where did you find that?
- -Yes, Ethan, that's right.<eos> I'myourbossdog . I'mBailey.<eos> Sayit.<eos> Boss dog?<eos> Are you the boss dog?
"Some shitwork for the oligarchs?"<eos> I actually enjoy what I do, and I've worked my ass off to get there.<eos> How did we end up like this?<eos> Okay, so... this is it, I guess.<eos> When Mom died it just happened, you know, but... you have the chance to leave me with something.
Excuse me. Just let me get through.<eos> Wilson.<eos> Jesus Christ, man!<eos> I'm just trying to get my life together and make a clean start.<eos> Why would you show up and say that shit?
I'm just trying to get my life together and make a clean start.<eos> Why would you show up and say that shit?<eos> I can't get over how amazing you look.<eos> I thought you'd be some... nasty, skanky, rat-haired, snaggle-toothed... sore-infested ho.<eos> But look... it's like you came through the gauntlet without a scratch!
Can this really be the same Pippi who used to... smoke and drink and curse and fart and belch?<eos> She was a disgusting pig.<eos> Well, there was never a dull moment, that's for sure.<eos> Pippi?<eos> You were the only person who ever bothered to get to know the real me.
You know?<eos> I did have the baby.<eos> What?<eos> I had a little girl.<eos> What are you talking about?
Don't you do another goddamn thing.<eos> I can't even catch my breath around you.<eos> I'm not talking about anything major, Pippi.<eos> I mean... don't you want to see her in the flesh?<eos> What are you saying now?
No, you watch it!<eos> That's my daughter!<eos> Wilson, not now!<eos> Bad timing!<eos> You little son of a bitch!
And I'll let her go.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I think you're right, Pippi.<eos> She certainly doesn't need any help from us.<eos> It's like she has that miserable, anguished look... like you had when I first met you.
And it is our duty to make sure that she doesn't have some major meltdown.<eos> You know? I mean, can you imagine what she's going through?<eos> No!<eos> No fucking way. Of course I can't.<eos> Can you?
We're not stalking her.<eos> Wilson.<eos> And how many times do I have to tell you what I'm going through, huh?<eos> I am barely making it through each day.<eos> And you're expecting this huge emotional commitment... while you're dragging me along for this insane fucking insta-family?
I am barely making it through each day.<eos> And you're expecting this huge emotional commitment... while you're dragging me along for this insane fucking insta-family?<eos> Pippi, it is that commitment... that is exactly what you need to help you move forward.<eos> Trust me, I know.<eos> You're an asshole!
I feel like I'm doing fieldwork among the natives or something.<eos> We shouldn't have come here.<eos> What?<eos> She'll always find a way to win.<eos> What are you talking about?
Kissing Dad's ass, staying all quiet while I spoke up for the both of us... and I'm the low-life scumbag?<eos> I knew I shouldn't have come back here.<eos> I heard Claire on the phone this morning.<eos> She told her mom she was staying at a beach house with her friend Hannah.<eos> You're a fucking cunt!
It's like the ultimate argument ender.<eos> Like, "No, I don't want your fucking job.<eos> "I want to destroy your entire society.<eos> "Fuck you."<eos> What'd you say, bitch?
We got a nice long journey ahead of us.<eos> Yeah, a couple of hours. Yeah.<eos> "Cyndi's Cupcakery?"<eos> What happened to the used bookstore?<eos> Is that you, Diana?
Wow.<eos> Hi.<eos> You look so... grown up.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You look good, too.
Oh, my God. I just came here... to shit on you for ratting me out to the Feds, and now this?<eos> This is... This is...<eos> You know, Portland is not so bad.<eos> I could be there to help her with anything she needs.<eos> What are you talking about?
What do we do?<eos> You need to scream.<eos> Over there!<eos> Secure that woman!<eos> - You filthy pirate!
Captain Jack Sparrow.<eos> No, it can't be.<eos> I've spent years searching for this?<eos> The great Jack Sparrow is not some drunk in a cell.<eos> Do you even have a ship? A crew?
- Are you sure you're the Jack Sparrow?<eos> - The real question is, who are you?<eos> My name is Henry Turner.<eos> Son of Will Turner and Elisabeth Swann.<eos> You're the evil spawn of them two?
I shall pass, thank you kindly.<eos> The price of crossing my door is blood, Captain.<eos> That explains why you're not so busy.<eos> Everyone pays, eventually.<eos> Shansa, you and I made a bond long ago.
FIRE!<eos> Still rather be stoned!<eos> Reload!<eos> Thank you.<eos> C'mere, you pirate scum!
Might be difficult once he kills me.<eos> Gentlemen, these two prisoners will lead us to the Trident.<eos> - Captain. - Hm?<eos> - Do you really think we can find the Trident?<eos> Master Gibbs, you old worrywart, there's nothing to be concerned about, at all.
What could possibly go wrong, eh?<eos> So this was your plan?<eos> To be tortured and killed by pirates?<eos> - You said you needed a ship.<eos> - You call this a ship?
- The Trident controls the seas.<eos> No, no!<eos> There's no treasure.<eos> There's no treasure that can save him.<eos> He will die, as will you.
Give me the map... or I will kill him.<eos> I'll kill him.<eos> Go on then.<eos> You're bluffing.<eos> And you're blushing.
A sailor washed ashore talking about the Trident.<eos> He was looking for Jack Sparrow.<eos> The same pirate who saved a witch from the gallows.<eos> - She's no witch.<eos> - But you are.
Your destiny is in these stars.<eos> I will set your course.<eos> Spaghetti balls!<eos> Why did I bother coming to you?<eos> The dead are hunting us down and you do nothing. - Nothing?
We have to find it.<eos> It's the only link to who I am.<eos> Who my father was.<eos> So we've both spent our lives, searching for our fathers.<eos> Perhaps you and I are closer than you think.
I'm not only an Astronomer, I'm also a horologist.<eos> No shame in that, dear.<eos> I mean, we all have to earn a living, eh?<eos> No, I'm a horologist.<eos> So was my mum, but, she didn't cry about it as loud as you.
He's right.<eos> Does any man here object to these nuptials? - I do.<eos> - Congratulations.<eos> You may kiss the bride.<eos> Y-y-you...
Trade Mr. Sparrow's life in for our own?<eos> Aye, that we could.<eos> But I've come for the Trident of Poseidon.<eos> You're gonna double cross the dead?<eos> You, did, promise.
Just believe her.<eos> Anyone?<eos> If we had something sharp, I could pick that lock.<eos> You're not gonna find anything sharp in here.<eos> Keep still you bilge rat!
- Maybe Jack was right.<eos> - About what?<eos> The unscratchable itch.<eos> Why did you do that for?<eos> Just checking it's truly you.
All right.<eos> Nice, nice. - Man: Not in a bathing suit.<eos> Me neither.<eos> - Hey. - Hey, kid.<eos> I heard you're the one who hustled those penny stocks in that shitty office you had downtown. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Look at you all dressed up and no place to die.<eos> - Hello, Jeffry. - Come on, Bernie, there's no need for stress.<eos> I haven't made many withdrawals. Although, that's probably something we should discuss, hmm?<eos> I did wanna tell you that there are some real opportunities in the market right now if you're interested, Jeffry.<eos> - Hmm. - What do you think?
Do you think you can do that?<eos> Do you think you can deal with that?<eos> - Yes, I can. - I don't think you can deal with it.<eos> I don't think so. You can't stomach that stuff.<eos> That's not in you. Andy, maybe, but not you.
The Mercedes-Benz station wagon, yachts and power boats, Mets jacket, a hodgepodge of personal items...<eos> Diana's voice: By the fall of 2009, Picard had separately collected roughly 1.5 billion from the firm's brokerage and bank accounts, asset sales, and a few out-of-court settlements.<eos> We filed suit against Ruth Madoff for 44 million.<eos> We have filed a clawback suit against Mark and Andrew Madoff for the return of $127.5 million.<eos> You can be in charge of the castle.
Close your eyes.<eos> Happy 19th, baby.<eos> Mark.<eos> - It's... it's stunning.<eos> - Just like you.
Let's go.<eos> Welcome to the Boom Boom Room.<eos> One drink and we're out.<eos> We can raise whatever you need.<eos> You believe that you Italians invented sex whereas everyone knows...
You know I prefer the sound of a lady's voice, Ella.<eos> - Well, he's pretty like a lady.<eos> - When are you going to run away with me?<eos> When are you going to shave?<eos> Everybody keeps talking about how beautiful you are, Ella.
- When are you going to run away with me?<eos> When are you going to shave?<eos> Everybody keeps talking about how beautiful you are, Ella.<eos> But to me, it's your spice. Gets me every time.<eos> I'll see you in two hours, you blind son of a bitch.
- Pretty much.<eos> - I don't appreciate stalkers, O'Connor.<eos> I'm not.<eos> - Seen any good movies lately?<eos> - Are you fucking kidding me?
- Well, does he?<eos> - No.<eos> - Does anyone?<eos> One or two.<eos> Do you?
I don't know whatever this crap is that he and Howard got into.<eos> Using the family account, what an idiot.<eos> - Everyone makes mistakes.<eos> - Yeah, well, this is a big one.<eos> At least you're not the one in prison.
Pretty please.<eos> Five minutes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So I hear you finally got a woman's voice.<eos> - Is that you, Gavin?
What's that supposed to mean?<eos> I need stability outside of you.<eos> Why would you say that?<eos> Why?<eos> Because you made choices.
I don't care how many decisions you have to make.<eos> I care about this decision which landed you here and implicated me.<eos> We're not guilty!<eos> Howard is.<eos> You'll understand that when I'm out of this hellhole and you won't have to read to any fucking cripple anymore.
I got your back, huh?<eos> You can depend on me.<eos> I promise you.<eos> So how come you never finished your second book?<eos> - How come you never finished your first?
Bill.<eos> Gavin!<eos> I didn't expect you to work for the privilege of my company.<eos> I don't want to take your money, Bill.<eos> I'm not offering you money, you presumptive little shit.
You bring your food, you put it on a tray and you bring it to me.<eos> Big Ricky G. Entiendes?<eos> You understand?<eos> Didn't your mother teach you not to touch another man's brownie?<eos> What the fuck did you say about my mother?
- Is this the ball field?<eos> - Yes. - You know what I like about this ball field?<eos> - What's that?<eos> Is that I can walk around here without my hands in front of my face.<eos> You don't walk around with your hands in front of your face.
- Bien sur.<eos> Well, it's been a long time since I've been to Paris.<eos> - So?<eos> - So.<eos> What do you say?
Suzanne, this is Frank.<eos> Frank's the super of our building.<eos> How do you do?<eos> - You're beautiful.<eos> I tell people like it is and you are a beautiful woman.
How do you do?<eos> - You're beautiful.<eos> I tell people like it is and you are a beautiful woman.<eos> In fact, the two of you look pretty freaking beautiful together.<eos> Bill, what'd you do?
I can see that you're beautiful.<eos> And I can see that you're fragile.<eos> I wanna see the way that you see.<eos> How you see me.<eos> I can see that you're fragile too.
- What's it gonna take?<eos> - Not to tell him?<eos> I don't know if I can put a price on that. Try.<eos> Not tonight.<eos> Are you fucking kidding me?
Just end this thing with him.<eos> Oh, I don't know if I forgive you.<eos> I've made mistakes.<eos> Everyone makes mistakes.<eos> Even you.
But we can change.<eos> I've changed.<eos> You know what I thought of when I was in prison?<eos> You know what got me through?<eos> You.
Please don't leave me. Not when my whole fucking world is falling apart. Baby, please.<eos> Please, baby.<eos> I need you so much. And I need you. I need you.<eos> I need you.<eos> - Suzanne, is that you?
- How dare you?<eos> - Are you gonna finish it?<eos> Yeah, I'm gonna finish it.<eos> - I'm gonna finish it.<eos> - What are you, what are you...
- Let it burn, Gavin!<eos> - No! Let it burn!<eos> - What the fuck is wrong with you?<eos> - Why don't you mind your own business?<eos> Why don't you get off your ass and do what you were put on this earth to do?
We had a deal.<eos> When the blood of a loved one is spilt in these waters, my desire must be met.<eos> There is no ambiguity, my Lord.<eos> We kept our side of the covenant.<eos> It was you who lost the boy, and the sword.
- Art. - We heard he'd had some trouble with the...<eos> - Vikings. Well, none of them are house-trained.<eos> - I thought you'd warned them.<eos> - I did. They don't speak English good.<eos> They speak it better than you.
I've seen you in my dreams.<eos> You've been sent by Merlin.<eos> Then you know why I am here.<eos> So, you will be his guide.<eos> And you will help me.
There's a crowd of thousands out there.<eos> They've come to see you more than they've come to see me.<eos> I will show them power.<eos> I will show them strength and dignity.<eos> You will show them lies, weakness, and shame.
You've made quite a celebrity of yourself among the Blackleg ranks.<eos> You've done very nicely on the back of your cozy relationship with your kingsmen.<eos> You know, I'm a little old for finger-wagging and speeches.<eos> So, unless you're my dad, which, I believe, is unlikely, can you just get around to telling me exactly what it is you want?<eos> What is it that you want?
You'll say something along the lines of,<eos> "What were you gonna do<eos> "if they wanted to fight?" And I'm gonna say,<eos> "I was never gonna fight."<eos> And you're gonna say, "Well, what was gonna happen?"
God help us. They've sent me a buffoon.<eos> You are a cunning old bastard, Vortigern.<eos> But what you fail to understand is that it's you who's fed the hangman that will eventually come for you.<eos> You're right, that's not Vortigern. But at least Mercia's here.<eos> What have you done? You can't shoot if it's a trap!
You might survive today. But the noose has been tied.<eos> We need to go. Now! Now.<eos> Put your arms up.<eos> Hello, boys. Wait, wait. Hey, hey, hey.<eos> Where are you going? Stop.
You're starting to mean something.<eos> That wasn't the intention.<eos> They are fighting in your name.<eos> I don't wanna wear that.<eos> Is that you, Blue?
Then you wouldn't mind if I cut his ears off?<eos> They're not my ears. Do what you want with them.<eos> No!<eos> Always wanted a boy. - Argh!<eos> - You bastard!
No!<eos> Crush the Resistance tonight!<eos> Archers!<eos> Let me show you what your uncle will do if you do not accept this sword.<eos> Only you can prevent this.
Let's think...<eos> "Be at the castle before dark" "if you wanna see the girl and the boy" "alive."<eos> I would love to stay and chat, but you do understand the situation between me and my wife.<eos> Anything that you do to me will be repaid 10 times in kind.<eos> Now, you're a big man.
The sword is yours, son.<eos> Take it.<eos> You wanted to know what gave me such drive?<eos> It was you.<eos> You put me in that brothel.
Take it.<eos> You wanted to know what gave me such drive?<eos> It was you.<eos> You put me in that brothel.<eos> You cut me on the streets.
Are you a good liar?<eos> Do you love me?<eos> Why do you ask that?<eos> I like to hear it.<eos> You don't like to say it.
Well, just look at the facts.<eos> Take it out of your hands.<eos> Why do you think it can't work as a country song?<eos> - It can.<eos> - Maybe you... As a... as a country...
That's one thing I know. You can't have it all.<eos> You gonna miss me?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Are you gonna miss me?
He's after you.<eos> I dreamed of having him help me the same way he helped you.<eos> You don't have to, uh... you know, hide anything.<eos> We don't have to have any secrets between us.<eos> Why is he after you if he's not attracted to you?
This is a ticket around the world.<eos> What are you afraid of?<eos> What do you wanna do'?<eos> Are you afraid of me?<eos> I was once like you.
I'm sorry that you're not as proud of me... as you are... with my sisters.<eos> I'm not who I thought I was.<eos> Am I a good person?<eos> You made so many... so many sacrifices for me.<eos> So that I could have a chance to do the things that you couldn't do...
- Can I walk with you?<eos> - No.<eos> I don't know how to change.<eos> I want to.<eos> How do you?
What's up with you?<eos> You all right?<eos> Man, where all this blood come from?<eos> You messed up, Cass.<eos> What you mean?
So I think he's just punishing me right now.<eos> What kind of fight, Vin?<eos> I don't know.<eos> He was just being him, you know?<eos> And I'm sure you were just being you.
Come on, man.<eos> You steal from me...<eos> And you kill my guys.<eos> Let's just figure it out.<eos> You stupid shit.
Just be a few more minutes.<eos> Something wrong?<eos> No. Everything's fine.<eos> I got a great 25-year-old bottle of Macallan up there with your name on it.<eos> What do you say?
Stop the fucking car.<eos> It's sugar.<eos> All right, call everyone.<eos> I want everyone here in 10 minutes.<eos> You come with me.
Yeah.<eos> It's over.<eos> Let's get out of here.<eos> Hey, Rob.<eos> What did you think?
It's over.<eos> Let's get out of here.<eos> Hey, Rob.<eos> What did you think?<eos> 'Cause you and my father used to party together when you were kids that I wouldn't kill you?
It's just a cut. It's just a cut.<eos> I'll be okay.<eos> Just give me a minute.<eos> You stole drugs from them?<eos> What you talking about?
You stole drugs from them?<eos> What you talking about?<eos> That's why you never home.<eos> This your overtime?<eos> Thought you out doing something good, and you out here fucking selling drugs.
What the fuck are you doin'?<eos> Fuck!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm just trying to get to my son.<eos> You dirty son of a bitch.
I have the product.<eos> Stay in the garage. I'm coming.<eos> Vincent Downs is internal affairs.<eos> He's five degrees from fingering us.<eos> You created the mess this morning.
Stay in the garage. I'm coming.<eos> Vincent Downs is internal affairs.<eos> He's five degrees from fingering us.<eos> You created the mess this morning.<eos> Now you clean it up.
Yeah.<eos> Okay. Um...<eos> You stay here with the bodies.<eos> You trying to take me down?<eos> Look, you go down, I go down, all right?
Listen.<eos> Got a folder on my desk.<eos> It's got every name of every cop, every detail of every job I did for you.<eos> Now, if I die, that folder...<eos> You, your daddy, your fuckin' family, you're done in Vegas.
You, your daddy, your fuckin' family, you're done in Vegas.<eos> You can't touch me.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But we're paying you a lot of money to protect us.<eos> And you're not doing your job.
I have the product.<eos> Stay in the garage. I'm coming.<eos> Vincent Downs is internal affairs.<eos> He's five degrees from fingering us.<eos> You created the mess this morning.
Stay in the garage. I'm coming.<eos> Vincent Downs is internal affairs.<eos> He's five degrees from fingering us.<eos> You created the mess this morning.<eos> Now you clean it up.
Your wife?<eos> It's the last picture of her before she left me.<eos> You know, I should clean this place up too, right? No, no.<eos> I like it like this.<eos> You write these?
It's not like this.<eos> It's just a story.<eos> It's a good start.<eos> Go on.<eos> You're the writer, man.
Then Jack takes off down the road.<eos> And then later the writer's driving home, so what does he do?<eos> I mean, he wants to be a nice guy, so he offers him work...<eos> So if... if Jack had some kind of relationship with the truck driver, that that would be very interesting.<eos> - I mean... you're the writer, right?
Hard to speak a single word, isn't it?<eos> That's where your script fails.<eos> That was the only way to show you.<eos> The woman on the run in your script she's about to have her throat slit. - What the fuck? - And you have her pleading with him.<eos> If she reacted like you just did that would be realistic.
I'm the one writing the story.<eos> I mean, I gave you your chance until you had that brilliant idea to open the door.<eos> It's your fault the sheriff's dead. No, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> I didn't kill anybody.<eos> You did! You did!
It means you have no manners.<eos> Going through a guest's belongings.<eos> Nothing worse than betrayal.<eos> I'm gonna finish our story, Paul.<eos> You're not capable of it.
Nothing worse than betrayal.<eos> I'm gonna finish our story, Paul.<eos> You're not capable of it.<eos> You finally found some imagination.<eos> What did you do, Jack?
- This is gonna end the way I want.<eos> - There's only one way this'll end, Paul.<eos> We clean this shit up before the cops come here and find out what we did.<eos> We didn't do anything.<eos> You did!
Make the most of it.<eos> It's gonna be your last for a while.<eos> We've been tracking you down for three years.<eos> Never found a crime scene until it was too late.<eos> And even then you left us nothing.
Should it be making that noise?<eos> No one has actually told me why I'm in Berlin.<eos> Or what I'm doing.<eos> Something about, Captain America going crazy...<eos> - This is you.
- Do you have a date for homecoming?<eos> - Thanks, Jason, but I already have a date.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Yep.<eos> You, in my office, right now!
Good.<eos> Yes.<eos> No, no.<eos> Put that down.<eos> That's worth more than you or me.
Feel free not to.<eos> - What was that?<eos> - That's nothing!<eos> Nothing!<eos> - You're the Spider-Man.
- What are you doing?<eos> - Helping you out.<eos> Did you not hear her?<eos> Liz has a crush on you.<eos> If any one of us has a chance with a senior girl, it's you.
Dude, you have the suit, right?<eos> This is gonna change our lives!<eos> We're gonna have Spider-Man swing in, say you guys are tight, and then I get... a fist bump for one of those half bro bumps.<eos> I can't believe you guys are at this lame party.<eos> You're here, too.
Sounds like it's no big deal.<eos> But remember, I'm watching you.<eos> - Everyone stick together.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Are you kidding me?
I covered for you...<eos> - Ned, listen to me!<eos> - We're in the Washington Monument.<eos> How're you gonna...<eos> - Peter, is that you?
- Thank you, Spider-Man.<eos> Up next: The Spider-Man mania is sweeping the school.<eos> How can you show your Spider spirit?<eos> Dude, dude, dude...<eos> What is it like being famous when nobody knows it's you?
You're just gonna run?<eos> Feds were waiting for us.<eos> And now, we're on Iron Man's radar?<eos> Yeah, I'm running.<eos> - You should, too.
- I don't need that on my conscience.<eos> - Yes, sir... I'm sorry, I...<eos> - Sorry doesn't cut it.<eos> - I understand.<eos> I just wanted to be like you.
I know you sneak out of this house every night.<eos> There's no fine.<eos> Peter, you have to tell me what's going on.<eos> Just lay it out.<eos> It's just me and you.
No. I ju-- - I just mean that...<eos> It was not cool, especially be...<eos> Because I like you.<eos> I know.<eos> - You do?
Or any of his little toys?<eos> Those people, Pete, those people up there, the rich and powerful...<eos> They do whatever they want.<eos> Guys like us...<eos> Like you and me...
Let's just say it was.<eos> - Mr. Stark, I really...<eos> - You screwed the pooch hard, big-time.<eos> But then, you did the right thing.<eos> You took the dog to the free clinic, you...
- You know what, he actually made a really mature choice.<eos> - He just surprised the heck out of us.<eos> - Did you guys screw this up?<eos> - He told the kid to go wait in the car.<eos> - Are you kidding me?
The entry of the Gods into Valhalla.<eos> A little anemic, not the orchestra.<eos> May I ask you a question, father?<eos> Please.<eos> If you created me...
I refuse to believe that man kind... is a random by-product of molecular circumstance.<eos> No more than the result of.. Mere biological chance.<eos> No.<eos> There must be more.<eos> And you and I, son...
There must be more.<eos> And you and I, son...<eos> We will find it.<eos> Allow me then a moment to consider.<eos> You seek your creator. I am looking at mine.
We will find it.<eos> Allow me then a moment to consider.<eos> You seek your creator. I am looking at mine.<eos> I will serve you.<eos> Yet you're human.
Allow me then a moment to consider.<eos> You seek your creator. I am looking at mine.<eos> I will serve you.<eos> Yet you're human.<eos> You will die.
One.<eos> Lander run released..<eos> And away they go.<eos> Looking gorgeous from up here Faris.<eos> It's a good thing you're driving... and not the old man.
Fucking open Faris.<eos> Open the door!<eos> Let me the fuck out!<eos> Let me out!<eos> Faris, you fuck!
Comply.<eos> Understood.<eos> Commencing descent now.<eos> Tennessee, you need to stop this.<eos> And you need to get back to your station.
Commencing descent now.<eos> Tennessee, you need to stop this.<eos> And you need to get back to your station.<eos> No, what we all need to do is calm down and talk this through.<eos> Tee, I know your wife is down there, but up here you're in command.
She put me back together.<eos> I had never known such kindness.<eos> Certainly not from Mr. Weyland... or from any human.<eos> I loved her, of course.<eos> Much as you love Daniels.
these enviable unions.<eos> My beautiful bestiary.<eos> Soon enough I began a bit of genetic experimentation of my own.<eos> Some cross-breeding, hybridising...<eos> You engineered this, David?
Masterful.<eos> Yes.<eos> Farewell elegy to my dear Elizabeth.<eos> The pathogen didn't accidentally deployed when were landing.<eos> You released it yes?
Hi.<eos> Thank you so much for coming in.<eos> Look, can we just talk about this when I get back from my vacation to Ecuador?<eos> Vacation?<eos> You never even asked for time off.
And it's because I forgot.<eos> Get out!<eos> God!<eos> You know what? I don't need this job.<eos> I'm gonna go have a sick time in Ecuador. You have fun here, with all your shirts and your hours.
Okay. The band is really blowing up right now, you know?<eos> I know.<eos> And I'm going like this.<eos> I'm taking off, all right?<eos> Okay. And this is you.
Hey, em.<eos> I thought you were mom, 'cause you guys have, like, the exact same voice.<eos> Okay. No, we don't.<eos> You have the exact same haircut, too.<eos> You know who you have the haircut of?
Enough. Don't do that.<eos> Okay, shadee, how about instead of rent this month, hear me out you cash in on a free trip to Ecuador?<eos> Come on!<eos> Aren't you, like, from there?<eos> Uh, no, you're the one who sounds racist, actually.
Okay, all right.<eos> I know.<eos> I'm a grown woman, so I'm fine.<eos> But thank you.<eos> Why are you dressed like powder? You look like a beekeeper.
I learned the capoa.<eos> You do that. And I danced with a lady.<eos> I'm okay.<eos> And we twerked.<eos> Did you ever twerk, ma?
This is my book now.<eos> This is not your book.<eos> Yes, it is. This is my book.<eos> You are too young to be acting like this.<eos> Oh, really? Well, you're too old to be acting like this.
No!<eos> You're coming!<eos> You wanna know how this ends, Linda? Yeah, I do.<eos> You will come tomorrow.<eos> What did you do?
We're gonna go past waterfalls. I always see about 12 rainbows.<eos> It's insane.<eos> Or, if you want we could just take the old, boring, dusty highway.<eos> I'll take the old, dusty highway.<eos> What? Do you hear yourself?
What do you know about anything?<eos> Except posting pictures of yourself?<eos> Okay, well, I only post so many pictures of myself because I want people to witness me having an interesting, full life and give me compliments in the comments.<eos> You can do that without posting pictures. I do.<eos> You have a full, interesting life?
It isn't. It's never been.<eos> I'd love to be the guy who sweeps you off your feet and is your hero and can save your mother and take care of you and maybe we hook up. I don't know.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> But I'm just saying that I am not that dude.<eos> So I need you to be that girl who just takes your box and walks outta this office before you draw any more attention to the fact that I don't know what I'm doing.
Let me have my day in court.<eos> All right, wait, wait, wait!<eos> Morgan, I'm a middle-aged man who never leaves the house.<eos> All I have in this world is my mama and my sister.<eos> And if something happens to them then all I'll have is you.
Very rude!<eos> Very rude!<eos> Here we go. Moving in hot.<eos> This is what we trained for.<eos> You, on the roof.
Very rude!<eos> Here we go. Moving in hot.<eos> This is what we trained for.<eos> You, on the roof.<eos> You, on the roof.
Here we go. Moving in hot.<eos> This is what we trained for.<eos> You, on the roof.<eos> You, on the roof.<eos> You, also on the roof.
- Truth or dare?<eos> - Sure. Like, the meanest, most rotten, horrible, dirtiest, dishonorable, despicable thing that you've ever done.<eos> I took the five finger discount on these back in Santa fe.<eos> Is that not what you meant?<eos> - What about you?
Are you crying?<eos> I thought I heard someone.<eos> I'm just hearing...<eos> Who?<eos> Who are you talking about?
Yeah.<eos> Come to bed.<eos> Ok.<eos> Hey!<eos> Was that you last night?
- in this godforsaken town.<eos> - I don't know who you are or...<eos> Just a man, Alex.<eos> What do you want? Tell me.<eos> Let's start with you telling me your particulars.
They sure don't make songs like they used to.<eos> It's louder because they know we're here.<eos> All this time and they never give up.<eos> Who?<eos> Who are you talking about?
But I didn't like to be all by my lonesome either.<eos> So I found people of my choosing and I took them out here.<eos> What I do first is I dig a hole, a nice deep hole, and I make them watch as I dig it.<eos> And then I take the person.<eos> Let's say it's you, or your girlfriend.
Jensen's pissed.<eos> And I saved your ass.<eos> I talked to the rancho clients myself, fuck you very much. - Clients?<eos> What clients?<eos> - What are you talking about?
When you think about a pea, what do you think of?<eos> A fresh pea, right? A normal pea.<eos> Don't you?<eos> I really don't think about peas, Alex.<eos> It's not really you, it's your subconscious.
Look, stay here with me.<eos> Ok, you need this.<eos> This is your home.<eos> I love you.<eos> And you love me.
And you love me.<eos> Paige?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I was thirsty.<eos> What are you doing?
Why don't you remind me.<eos> We're in love.<eos> If you want it, just take it.<eos> You don't have to ask me if it's ok.<eos> - What are you talking about?
What the fuck is wrong with you people?<eos> Why are you lying?<eos> He's been watching me across the street for weeks.<eos> I think he was trying to rape me.<eos> What the fuck are you talking about?
Do you ever think of anyone but yourself?<eos> This means something.<eos> Something bigger than you can imagine.<eos> My life's work.<eos> And you were going to steal it.
- Along with his child.<eos> She made some sort of pact with the God of death.<eos> And then, when I saw those birds and that sandstorm...<eos> Whatever I mean something is happening. You are alive I do not know how.<eos> You...
How did you mess that up?<eos> It's just in my head. No it's not.<eos> You shot me.<eos> Wait.<eos> What.. wait wait wait you...
It's just in my head. No it's not.<eos> You shot me.<eos> Wait.<eos> What.. wait wait wait you...<eos> You you stabbed Greenway.
Wait.<eos> What.. wait wait wait you...<eos> You you stabbed Greenway.<eos> - I saved you.<eos> - You murdered him.
Okay?<eos> Not okay.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Look at my face.<eos> I'm cursed Nick, and you are cursed.
- ...no more curse.<eos> You don't need a sarcophagus, you need a doctor.<eos> I know someone.<eos> A specialist in London.<eos> Don't tell me that you don't want to see it too.
I told you.. I said.. That I wanted to see...<eos> - I wanted to see her corpse.<eos> - See her corpse.<eos> Nick she is in your head.<eos> What are you talking about?
You are a younger man but you must learn to be wary of a man like me.<eos> It's not me that wants to kill you, it's Henry.<eos> I have something more collaborative in mind.<eos> I'm offering you a partnership.<eos> You, evil incarnate.
Give it to me my chosen.<eos> Give it to me my love.<eos> Somewhere in there I know you're a good man.<eos> The world needs a cure.<eos> You can be that cure.
Look at them!<eos> Look at them!<eos> It's just like the neighbors.<eos> Go to my shed. You'll see I'm right!<eos> What have you done?
But our next group of friends is due to arrive, so it's time to bust you out.<eos> Copperfield's coming. Presto changeo!<eos> Woman in a box.<eos> In a box.<eos> Yeah, he's classy, unlike you.
Your ass is grass, Constantine.<eos> And we're the lawnmower.<eos> Since the battle's fought and won,<eos> Jason Blood with me is done.<eos> For 500 years, I've been bound to Etrigan, fighting to keep him from coming forth, and you forced me to summon him.
Yeah, it's dodgy, all right.<eos> I'll look into it.<eos> Meanwhile, the House will drop you wherever you'd like.<eos> Rama says we have to work together.<eos> Come on! It's a dream team. You, me, Zatanna, Batman, maybe even the Justice League.
- I tried to tell him on the way.<eos> - Yeah, it's not your fault, Z.<eos> Just like everything, this is rock star Johnny's fault.<eos> I was with you when it happened, Ritchie. We were side by side.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah, side by side. But I got the weird magical cancer while you, you added to your rep. Isn't that right?
Get control, Z, just like I taught you.<eos> Easy-peasy, lemon squeezy.<eos> Deep breaths.<eos> Let it go, love.<eos> Do you see why I can't do what you do?
No my friend, not you.<eos> It is the duty of society to care for the elderly.<eos> This "Chuck" never cared.<eos> "Chuck".<eos> - Are you "Chuck"?
What is going on here exactly?<eos> Both lost his mind.<eos> Think about it, "Al".<eos> I do not want to think about anything, I am not a bank robber.<eos> Neither are you, nor are you, "Willie."
What?<eos> Why did you answer the phone?<eos> Because he was ringing.<eos> Because you're interested.<eos> Have you become my psychiatrist now?
Never happened all my life. That someone stole Full pork pudding.<eos> What was your mother to say?<eos> Perform a major operation or go home.<eos> The thief must have been black.<eos> And why did you do it?
Two or three years?<eos> That's it?<eos> Looks great health!<eos> It's just a feeling, you asked me.<eos> What about you?
Looks great health!<eos> It's just a feeling, you asked me.<eos> What about you?<eos> In my opinion, seven years.<eos> What about you, "Al"?
We raise our hands up.<eos> Maximum 2 minutes.<eos> Maximum, increase or decrease.<eos> Take a nap, young man.<eos> Well, you too, young man.
This is my bank!<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> Do not move!<eos> I do not move?<eos> I'm not telling me not to move, You do not move!
There will not be many men like him.<eos> Someone willing to risk everything For others.<eos> Ready to make a nice word. Or college.<eos> With complaint about it all the time.<eos> That's you.
I don't belong here.<eos> And I'm ashamed of that.<eos> A war story can't be true unless it's got some shame attached to it.<eos> Hey! Ocre!<eos> What do you think?
This place will be a ghost town. Ticktock, ticktock.<eos> Right?<eos> Right.<eos> Hey, if I don't see you for the rest of the war, be safe.<eos> You too.
Fuck that!<eos> Noble lion, this is eagle two.<eos> Sniper fire is too heavy.<eos> I'm suggesting an air strike. Over.<eos> - What the hell are you doing? - What a clusterfuck of a...
What the fuck is going down?<eos> - Hold up! - Open up! He moved!<eos> He's not dead!<eos> Calm the fuck down.<eos> What are you talking about?
Calm the fuck down.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> - He's fucking moving'.<eos> - What the fuck?<eos> What the hell you talking about?
Nah. Nah, you couldn't pay me enough to ride the turret.<eos> We hit shit, all the fire's coming your way, buddy.<eos> Yeah, that's true.<eos> But when we get home, I'll remember the breeze, sunshine.<eos> Like you'll remember sitting in the dark, sweating your ass off.
You just watch Burton!<eos> You watch Burton, okay?<eos> You're gonna be good!<eos> We'll see you soon!<eos> You fuck!
Stay down!<eos> Come on. Stay down. Stay low!<eos> Down!<eos> Ella, get in! Come on, there could be more of them. Come on!<eos> You... you drive. You drive.
- This is for you.<eos> - What?<eos> It's a recording.<eos> A keepsake so the memory need never fade.<eos> - Who are you?
It's not in my interest to squeeze you too hard, and it's not in your interest to provoke me.<eos> So let's meet in the middle.<eos> 10% of your salary per annum.<eos> Paid monthly on a rolling, indefinite basis.<eos> You disgusting shit!
You in this with her, are you? You fuck!<eos> Fuck off!<eos> I see you again, Cunt, you fucking die.<eos> Fuck off!<eos> - Where were you?
Mr. Doyle won't let that happen.<eos> I don't like to think of you working there, okay? Why not?<eos> Because I fuck men?<eos> How is this better?<eos> I could have been killed and you would have done nothing because you were sitting next door, taking cocaine.
Spud.<eos> Spud!<eos> Spud.<eos> Fucking hell!<eos> You!
Spud!<eos> Spud.<eos> Fucking hell!<eos> You!<eos> - You, you bastard!
- What?<eos> What the fuck are you doing to me?<eos> I was just fucking saving your life!<eos> Save my life?<eos> You ruined my fucking life, Mark.
Simon?<eos> No, no. He's probably too busy.<eos> You got to see old Simon, man.<eos> You know how it was, Spud.<eos> You and Simon was like that, man. Hello, Frank.
Little Mark, eh?<eos> Bet he's a chip off the old block.<eos> James, actually.<eos> And Laura.<eos> How about you?
- I see.<eos> £16,000!<eos> You thieving fucking bastard!<eos> You missed a trick! That's what hurts, isn't it?<eos> That I had the brains and the fucking balls to steal the money and you didn't!
Shut it.<eos> Veronika...<eos> I'm gonna make him sorry he ever came back.<eos> Shut up! What's the fucking matter with you?<eos> Frank, is that you?
But what are you gonna do?<eos> I'm not gonna be sitting on me ass watching fucking telly all day. That's for sure.<eos> - Frank, what if...<eos> - No, no, listen.<eos> You and me, son.
I'm not gonna be sitting on me ass watching fucking telly all day. That's for sure.<eos> - Frank, what if...<eos> - No, no, listen.<eos> You and me, son.<eos> You and me.
- What?<eos> - I'm doing a diploma in hotel management.<eos> Good one.<eos> Fucking... Fucking had us there.<eos> Seriously, son, you and me, you and me.
- Dog shit park.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And we shared a needle.<eos> Shared a needle, yeah.<eos> You went first.
Well, you know Simon.<eos> I certainly remember him.<eos> - Does he still take heroin?<eos> - No.<eos> Do you?
Out well towards the right, Fine 'n' Dandy is racing solo early on.<eos> Steventon Star down the center with Jacob's Pillow.<eos> Hello, Franco.<eos> Simon.<eos> - But you're not...
Don't say, "I don't know."<eos> Just fucking tell me where he is.<eos> - Still a junkie, Murphy?<eos> I'm clean now, Frank.<eos> You-You-You Clean?
This your bird, Murphy?<eos> Please, Franco, leave her alone.<eos> She has nothing to do with this.<eos> 'Course she hasn't.<eos> What would she be doing with an ugly Cunt like you?
Honestly, mate...<eos> Fucking deal with you later.<eos> Now...<eos> Rent Boy.<eos> You and me.
My future wife.<eos> Belle is the most beautiful girl in the village.<eos> That makes her the best.<eos> But she's so well-read.<eos> And you're so...
But what if she is the one? The one who'll break the spell?<eos> Who said that?<eos> Who's there?<eos> Papa?<eos> Papa, is that you?
Gosh it disturbs me to see you, Gaston<eos> Looking so down in the dumps<eos> Every guy here'd love to be you, Gaston<eos> Even when taking your lumps<eos> There's no man in town as admired as you
LeFou... my dearest companion... did I... your oldest friend and most loyal compatriot... try to kill the father of the only woman I've ever loved?<eos> Well, it's a complicated question on a number of accounts...<eos> But no.<eos> No, he did not.<eos> You...
He's gentle and kind.<eos> The monster has her under his spell.<eos> If I didn't know better, I'd say she even cared for him!<eos> He's not a monster, Gaston.<eos> You are!
Don't lose your nerve, LeFou. Where are we?<eos> This place seems familiar.<eos> Like I've been here before.<eos> Oh, hello, there.<eos> You must be the talking tea cup.
This place seems familiar.<eos> Like I've been here before.<eos> Oh, hello, there.<eos> You must be the talking tea cup.<eos> And you must be... his grandmother. Grandmother?
Nature points the way<eos> Nothing left to say<eos> Beauty and the Beast What?<eos> What is it?<eos> How would you feel about growing a beard?
But if God is always with us, why does He care if we're late for church?<eos> - She's got a point. - Yeah.<eos> God cares because your mama cares.<eos> Okay, come on.<eos> It was a nice try, you little rascal.
I'll heat up that rice thing.<eos> Just a little tired, I guess.<eos> I was gonna clear up the driveway before dark.<eos> Call me in the morning.<eos> Yeah, you, too.
- Great!<eos> I'll see you later.<eos> You have a nice family.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You as well.
Hey, Mack. We're just sitting down for dinner.<eos> - What the heck is this?<eos> - What?<eos> Some kind of sick joke?<eos> You... you think I wrote this?
Dad? Can I go finish my homework at Ally's?<eos> You've seen the weather out, right?<eos> - It's only two streets away.<eos> - Another time.<eos> Hey, you.
Where are you?<eos> I'm here.<eos> Come on out.<eos> You couldn't even let us have her body buried properly.<eos> You coward.
I've been tellin' you all about Josh and Kate and Nan.<eos> But if you're real... then you already know everything I'm gonna say before I even say it, right?<eos> Yes, but we choose to listen to everything you have to say as if it was for the first time.<eos> We love getting to know your kids through your eyes.<eos> I'll wash, you dry?
Well, if it helps me... or the people that I love.<eos> And evil?<eos> It's harmful.<eos> If it hurts someone I care about.<eos> So, pretty much, you are the judge?
Yeah, I guess.<eos> You ever been wrong?<eos> Or changed your opinion over time?<eos> I mean, sure.<eos> And there are billions like you... each determining what you think is good and evil.
What do you think?<eos> It's still a mess.<eos> Yes, it is, Mack.<eos> Wild, wonderful, and perfectly in process.<eos> This mess is you.
Put your shoes back on.<eos> I'll show you how you can.<eos> Follow the path until it ends, and then keep going.<eos> You're not comin'?<eos> This is a path only you can take.
- Judge you?<eos> Do you have something to confess?<eos> Oh, you know what I did.<eos> Yes.<eos> But you're not the one on trial.
Do you have something to confess?<eos> Oh, you know what I did.<eos> Yes.<eos> But you're not the one on trial.<eos> Today, you are the judge.
Or fathers who beat their sons to alleviate their own suffering?<eos> Let's not do this.<eos> Should that man be judged?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And you're gonna keep your mouth shut!
What about this boy?<eos> - What about him?<eos> - Would you judge him?<eos> He's a kid.<eos> But you already have.
I... I never should've stood up on that boat.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Don't think about the past.<eos> Everything's gonna be okay.<eos> I know what it feels like to carry what you've been carrying.
- Shark got you.<eos> - Are you serious? Look what you did.<eos> I'll get you a new one.<eos> Can we please do something? I'm so bored. I don't know how you can just lie in the sun all day.
This is Méjico, okay?<eos> It's not even diving.<eos> You're gonna be in a cage.<eos> You're only down five minutes. - It's totally safe.<eos> - Exactly. It's like you're going to the zoo, except you're in the cage.
Can you girls hear me? - Yeah.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Lisa, how you doing?<eos> I'm good, actually.<eos> - Kate, how about you?
No, no, no. Kate, Kate, Kate, Kate, there has to be some other way.<eos> - No, just stop, and think for a second. - You have to calm down.<eos> No, no. Kate, you can't take off your mask. - Lisa, calm down!<eos> Stop. - No, I can't.<eos> I'm gonna take some deep breaths, I'm gonna take it off... and go through and you're gonna pass it right to me, okay?
The other night at the hotel, what did you mean when you said that your relationship was the only thing you were good at?<eos> You're always doing such fun stuff, Kate.<eos> Traveling around the world doing crazy things, guys always chasing after you.<eos> I could never compete with that.<eos> I was always just your boring older sister, but... my relationship with Stuart was the one thing I had that you didn't.
It's okay, they're gonna come and get us.<eos> Read me your air.<eos> Um... um... it says 80 bar.<eos> At this depth, that means we have about 20 minutes, tops, before you run out.<eos> What about you?
Kate, I'm so lost.<eos> Kate, can you hear me?<eos> Get back into the cage!<eos> Kate? Kate, I can hear you!<eos> Can you hear me?
Would you rather have seven dirty-ass tramps take dumps in your mouth, and all they've eaten all day is spring onions, boiled ham and raw eggs, or would you rather suck off your old man?<eos> And when I say suck him off I don't mean give him a quick jerk under the table.<eos> I mean, you'd have to seduce him, you know, to the point where he's grabbing your hair and forcing your fucking face down into his cock - and he thrusts into your throat.<eos> - Take Dad.<eos> What about you?
- Come on, just pick one.<eos> - Go, what?<eos> - Nan's period blood?<eos> - Bullshit, you've got to mean it.<eos> - What? - So, you'd mean it, would you?
- When are your parent's back?<eos> - November.<eos> - What? A month?<eos> - It's their silver wedding anniversary.<eos> - What about you?
- But it's already been a fucking week.<eos> - Yes, so it won't be long now, will it?<eos> Oh, and they'll know exactly where to find us when they do, won't they?<eos> Why do you have to be some damn insensitive?<eos> Why do you have to be so fucking full of shit?
Daddy, Treasure Island.<eos> - I don't think it's a good idea.<eos> - Mom, just for a minute.<eos> Can we see the island?<eos> What do you say, Mom?
You don't have a witness that saw your wife or your son get onto that boat.<eos> Days later you show up at a bank to complete a wire transfer to an offshore account accompanied by a mysterious fisherman.<eos> Mr. Riley, is there actually a fisherman?<eos> Is it possible that your family was not on the boat as you said?<eos> Are you serious?
Novels are for people who can't edit themselves.<eos> Cards are still the ultimate challenge.<eos> For you, maybe.<eos> Sweet talk will get you nowhere.<eos> You.
I want you to meet Uncle Ray.<eos> Why is that woman crying?<eos> Who can say?<eos> Probably a love thing.<eos> Do you love anybody?
Who can say?<eos> Probably a love thing.<eos> Do you love anybody?<eos> Maybe.<eos> You?
Girlfriend's Day, an occasion for men, and women as well, to tell their favorite lady friend just how much she means to them.<eos> This was my niece Coco's idea.<eos> We're going to hold a contest to see who can write the most romantic card to initiate the new holiday.<eos> "In an effort to inject new blood into the failing greeting card industry," the governor is limiting contestants to amateurs and... "out-of-work professionals."<eos> That is you, my friend.
- I like your tat.<eos> - Oh. I saw it on the back of a truck once.<eos> I thought it was cuckoo.<eos> It is... cuckoo.<eos> You're not, though, are you?
You can't have it.<eos> What?<eos> You can't have it!<eos> I didn't write it for you.<eos> I'm gonna give it to the person I wrote it for, and you can suck my dick, okay?
Whatever.<eos> Did the trick?<eos> Shut the hell up.<eos> All right, let's see what gay sentence turned on the lady's faucets.<eos> You piece of shit.
Not in this house!<eos> Everybody's equals here.<eos> Mr. Gundy?<eos> Hello, Raymond.<eos> You crazy asshole.
Taft was writing a card for my competition.<eos> You mean your brother.<eos> I learned long ago, never let the trappings of shared DNA impede my path to success.<eos> - All this for a fucking card?<eos> - Shut up! Is your brother as crazy as you are?
Now... when my junky nephew and Jill bore a child,<eos> Of course, I was foolish enough to let her stay in the child's life.<eos> It was a tangled web indeed, but now I intend to clear the situation up, once and for all.<eos> You can have it.<eos> You get the card, Jill gets the girl.
What's the matter with you?<eos> Do you want another hole in your head?<eos> You start a fight in there, you ain't gonna win it.<eos> They were there.<eos> - What you talking about?
But you wouldn't know anything about that, would you, Luce?<eos> No.<eos> - 'Cause I think you might...<eos> - Leave it, Eugene.<eos> - What about you, Tom?
You've always had a thing for Lucy, ain't ya?<eos> - And you're a geek.<eos> - I'm not a geek.<eos> But you look like a geek.<eos> You little shit, it's you, innit?
Are you fucking kidding me?<eos> - What'd you expect...? - Don't talk to her.<eos> Well, I wouldn't shoot an unarmed girl tied to a chair.<eos> Shut up.<eos> But I guess I'm not a big man like you, Eugene.
All right. I forgive you.<eos> I see his face whenever I close my eyes.<eos> I see a lot of faces when I close my eyes.<eos> I don't know if it ever really goes away.<eos> But I'll help you if you help me.
-You?<eos> -Punished.<eos> Just don't want to be with these people.<eos> -What's so funny?<eos> -It's you.
-Thanks.<eos> Not as good as my brother, but then I don't spend quite as much time in makeup as he does.<eos> Why don't you just take the compliment and move on?<eos> Sorry.<eos> You look good, too, Kate. Thank you.
Very well. Thank you.<eos> Can I get you anything else?<eos> Look, can someone just call a cab or something.<eos> I mean, I don't have enough for all the way home.<eos> What about you, Beau?
Do I really need to spell this out for you?<eos> I just think he instinctively exploits his position in the family.<eos> You know, it's fascinating.<eos> She was never like this with Rick or Val or Stanley.<eos> Are you listening to yourself?
Yes, you are, Kate.<eos> Yes, you are.<eos> Far from it. She's been patiently listening to my complaints about work.<eos> Sometimes, it's just nice to connect.<eos> You never complain, do you, Kate?
What, what are you, are you in charge?<eos> What's my role in this family? Who am I? Who...<eos> The village idiot?<eos> This whole time, it's... I've been the odd man out.<eos> It's been you and Michael.
Never again will Confederacy come so close to winning the Civil War as they do here at this moment on this day, July 3rd, 1803, Gettysburg.<eos> This is too much, I don't know.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Almost as many here as the whole Vietnam war. You realize that? 50,000?<eos> What are you talking about?
-No, Paul. -Paul, let him.<eos> -I don't want to talk. Please, dear.<eos> We're gonna put the truth right here in front of us, and we're gonna do something about it. Okay?<eos> And, Paul, if you could just get out of your head for a minute.<eos> Me? What about you, Scarf ace?
-Thank you.<eos> You're an angel.<eos> Barbara and I think it might be best for Michael if he comes to stay with us for a while.<eos> Paul, let's get a maid in here, and get you back on your feet.<eos> Michael needs to start going back to school. And you need to start visiting Claire again.
I need to call Michael. -What time is it?<eos> -A little after 10:00.<eos> Poor kid.<eos> He's been alone all night.<eos> What do you think, Paul?
Listen, listen, you never listened to me the whole night.<eos> I've listened to you. I've listened to you when you made me feel like shit in there for not agreeing with you. And now you're making me feel like shit in here for not agreeing with you.<eos> I'm done. I'm done fighting.<eos> Yeah, sure you are.<eos> Sure you are, because either way you win.
You know who I am.<eos> You're the man who puts me to sleep.<eos> We both could use some sleep.<eos> No! No!<eos> What are you doing to me?
No one should live like this.<eos> Drugged in a fucking tank!<eos> - It's for your own good.<eos> - No, it's not!<eos> You're waiting for me to die.
That money's to get us out of here.<eos> No, not us. You and him.<eos> You're saving to buy a Sunseeker.<eos> "Sun" is the keyword. I hardly see myself cowering below decks like Nosferatu.<eos> Do you?
So, you saw Gabriela.<eos> But you didn't call me.<eos> That hurts.<eos> You didn't shoot the poor thing, did you?<eos> - No, did you?
Move! Go!<eos> Holy shit!<eos> Gotcha!<eos> Come on, hold her down.<eos> As I told you, Logan, she's a mutant like you.
Gotcha!<eos> Come on, hold her down.<eos> As I told you, Logan, she's a mutant like you.<eos> Hold on!<eos> Very much like you.
Shit.<eos> Fall in! Let's go!<eos> Sit back.<eos> Bring me the tracker.<eos> You.
Caliban, I bet that's what your mama told you every day when you was a kid.<eos> Beware of the light.<eos> Now, let's not bring out the worst in each other.<eos> The girl is not worth it, trust me.<eos> She's not a natural fuck-up like you.
But we have a long drive ahead of us, so...<eos> But you need to rest, don't you?<eos> Yeah, we'll find a motel somewhere.<eos> The nearest one is two hours from here and it's not even that nice.<eos> We have a perfectly fine room upstairs for your father and your daughter and you can sleep in the living room on the convertible.
- Pierce!<eos> - Give me that.<eos> Get your lily-faced ass out here!<eos> Listen to me!<eos> What the fuck do you think you're doing?
Let's go.<eos> You can't just take shit, you know.<eos> I don't know how you got me here... but thank you.<eos> De nada. Yeah.<eos> You can talk?
Got me, scary ghost.<eos> Why don't you go find Carla and show her?<eos> Now I am a dead girl.<eos> Oh, David.<eos> You idiot.
Trail markers made of crushed Natural Ice cans from frat bros.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Thank you.<eos> This is the best campsite around, okay, and nobody even knows about it.<eos> - How'd you know about it?
- Gretchen?<eos> - You shouldn't be here.<eos> - What the fuck, man?<eos> - Jay, what's happening?<eos> What are you... what time is it?
What are you suggesting we do?<eos> I think it would be helpful if Stacy takes a break from school, vacation, if you will, until the dust settles.<eos> You can expect a call from our lawyer later this afternoon.<eos> You've always been decent to our family, Cora but your son needs real help.<eos> And if you can't see that apparently so do you.
And when I found out those sick people wanted you for their own I went to the doctor I should've seen in the first place, and I told him our crazy story and Andy, Andy, he believed me.<eos> And he gave us enough money to leave the city, and we've been running ever since.<eos> That doctor's kindness, that's proof of God, Andy.<eos> I had never learned to take care of myself until that day that day I found out they wanted you for their own.<eos> I had to choose my old life or you, and I chose you, Andy.
- Through the new schools and the chickenpox and the loneliness, where was he?<eos> He never made an appearance, only now, now that I've done all the heavy lifting.<eos> Well, I'm not finished.<eos> He doesn't get to make the choice.<eos> You make it. You make it.
No. No.<eos> I work in a sport school.<eos> What sort of sports?<eos> I mean, I'm an English teacher, that's why.<eos> And you?
She's holding her hands like that... To hide her deformed finger.<eos> I thought you wanted to leave.<eos> So, if you have a question, you Google it.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I'm... I'm definitely partial toward Google.<eos> Are you not?
Can you please... stop?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Please.<eos> Can't you just be normal?<eos> You're abnormal.
Leave it.<eos> You don't have to wash up. We can do it later.<eos> Come. It's twelve.<eos> Does Peter mind you acting like this?<eos> What are you talking about?
He gonna fuck that coffee machine up.<eos> Is this a practical joke?<eos> You know I don't play that shit.<eos> How the fuck you work this bullshit?<eos> You.
No meth, period.<eos> When I'm on my period, don't do it?<eos> That's when I need it the most.<eos> Holly, you're the guidance counselor.<eos> - You've never done it?
You're gonna have to take the manual out, because I think...<eos> All right, I'm gonna start from the beginning.<eos> First I'm gonna power on the...<eos> - Was that you? - No.<eos> I thought that was you.
First I'm gonna power on the...<eos> - Was that you? - No.<eos> I thought that was you.<eos> No, I didn't push the button.<eos> - That was you.
Do it.<eos> No!<eos> All right. Who did that? Who did it?<eos> Who did it?<eos> It was you! It was you, wasn't it?
And I got a goddamn mariachi band following me around wherever I go!<eos> I offered them $100 and they still won't leave.<eos> I think they thought it was a tip.<eos> And now I've got 20 students running out of a classroom in a panic.<eos> Students telling me that Neil's desk has been smashed to pieces, presumably by a fire ax, and you're telling me that you haven't seen anything today?
I think they thought it was a tip.<eos> And now I've got 20 students running out of a classroom in a panic.<eos> Students telling me that Neil's desk has been smashed to pieces, presumably by a fire ax, and you're telling me that you haven't seen anything today?<eos> Yeah.<eos> How about you, Strickland? Huh?
He did it.<eos> You did it.<eos> I mean, you did do it, so...<eos> He did it.<eos> That's what happened, was you...
- I want everybody to see this.<eos> Teachers don't fight.<eos> We're gonna handle our differences like real men.<eos> What differences?<eos> You got a job and I don't!
You got a job and I don't!<eos> That's the fucking difference.<eos> This is a bad joke.<eos> Snitches get stitches.<eos> Snitches and stitches, what the fuck you talking about?
Andy?<eos> - Hey!<eos> - What?<eos> - I know!<eos> What are you...
Why are you guys here? Why aren't you in school?<eos> Oh, I pulled her from P.E.<eos> We had to get a new outfit for the talent show.<eos> Apparently the old one wasn't good enough.<eos> But, honey, why are you here?
Yeah. But you know what?<eos> I was looking at the AV system, and I heard the crash and, you know, I did...<eos> You know how when you do one of these and you're like, "Oh, my God."<eos> And then your hands are flying in front of your face, and, like, that can look like chopping.<eos> But you were right there.
- All right.<eos> - Look, why?<eos> Because actions have consequences, and everybody around here seem to forget about that.<eos> These students, they shit on this school all day and don't nobody do nothing.<eos> Little kids, they come in last place, and pussies like you, you wanna give 'em a trophy.
These students, they shit on this school all day and don't nobody do nothing.<eos> Little kids, they come in last place, and pussies like you, you wanna give 'em a trophy.<eos> I say fuck a trophy.<eos> Nobody's being held accountable anymore.<eos> So, I'mma hold you accountable.
I'mma kick yo' ass at the end of the day in front of everybody.<eos> And you can consider this my final lesson.<eos> Yeah, you guys should fucking fight.<eos> This is crazy, you know?<eos> Do you hear yourself?
- Molly?<eos> - Yeah. Why?<eos> What?<eos> Dogs can't smell molly.<eos> What did you do?
Come on. Yeah.<eos> But, yeah, him. Yeah.<eos> If he wants to fight me, I'm right here.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, you're here. He's there.
Wanted to wring your little neck.<eos> - Yeah. - But then I start thinking.<eos> What if the school saw how they pitted two teachers against each other?<eos> Maybe the fight'll make a difference and something would change.<eos> But you won't even man up and fight.
Trisha, this song is for you.<eos> I don't fuck with you<eos> You little stupid ass bitch I ain't fuckin' with you<eos> What?<eos> You little You little dumb ass bitch
Where the fuck are you at?<eos> Surprise, bitch!<eos> Get the fuck off me!<eos> Shit!<eos> You dirty mother...
- All right.<eos> Let's roll. I got you.<eos> - All right.<eos> You got gas money?<eos> Hey! Hey, you!
Thank you, man.<eos> Like, thank you for the fight. Really.<eos> You did good.<eos> Get the fuck off me.<eos> What you doing?
Well, well, well.<eos> Look what the cat dragged in.<eos> You here to fire everybody again?<eos> Yeah, yeah. Cut the shit, Campbell.<eos> I don't wanna be here any more than you want me to, okay?
Yeah, yeah. Cut the shit, Campbell.<eos> I don't wanna be here any more than you want me to, okay?<eos> Well, I wouldn't say that I don't want you here.<eos> But why are you here?<eos> Well, because of the media attention, you and Strickland became like education folk heroes.
I will kick you into oblivion, Freddie.<eos> I will kick you into dust!<eos> Whoa, Campbell.<eos> Take it down a notch.<eos> I'm supposed to be the scariest motherfucker in this school, not you.
Open it!<eos> What are you looking for?<eos> Hurry up! Search well.<eos> Anything there?<eos> You!
Sir, my name is Jaideep Ambalal Majmudar.<eos> Ambalal is my late father.<eos> Even if his spirit asks me to release Hasmukh bhai and his party,<eos> I'll take it in writing.<eos> And you are merely...!
I love you<eos> I love you<eos> Awesome!<eos> Really?<eos> Not you.
Father's down with cough again.<eos> Salaam Aleikom, doctor.<eos> Waleikom Asalaam.<eos> Something's wrong with my eyes.<eos> It's you!
Ten.<eos> (BOTH MOANING)<eos> I love it here, this house.<eos> You were born here.<eos> You grew up here.
No, no, no!<eos> Argh!<eos> It was you.<eos> You did this.<eos> You... (MICHAEL GROANS)
I thought maybe you wouldn't want me anymore.<eos> - Come here.<eos> - (SOBBING)<eos> Listen to me.<eos> Nothing matters but you and I.
My father has always impressed with bias men.<eos> Me?<eos> I have my doubts.<eos> Anyone can wear the robes of monk.<eos> You...
Shouldn't be a difficult decision.<eos> like your father,<eos> Did you tell your fellow monks the reason the Church has trusted<eos> Geraldus Trencavel d'Albi. with such an important task?<eos> Are you denounce him as a heretic, when he refused to repent, you, your only son, sent him first to the wheel, and then to the stake.
It's obvious though, isn't it, what happened?<eos> John, you amaze me.<eos> You know what happened?<eos> Not a clue.<eos> It's just you normally say that at this point. Hmm.
The Mall, please.<eos> I met her once.<eos> Thatcher?<eos> Rather arrogant, I thought.<eos> YOU thought that? !
Moriarty - did he have any connection with Thatcher?<eos> Any interest in her?<eos> Why on earth would he?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You tell me.
They're two different things. She can't be the devil and the Antichrist.<eos> Yeah, can't she?<eos> I'm coming, darling.<eos> Mummy's coming.<eos> Oh, what are you doing?
Well, you're about to solve a big one.<eos> Yeah, until John publishes his blog. Yeah, until then, basically.<eos> That's enough now, love.<eos> Daddy has things to do, I'm afraid.<eos> And you need to get to bed. Come on.
The problems of your future... ..are my privilege.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> She destroyed it.<eos> She?<eos> You know her!
Stay close to me and I will keep you safe from him, I promise you.<eos> There's something I think you should read.<eos> What is it?<eos> I hoped I wouldn't have to do this.<eos> What are you...?
Mary, no human action is ever truly random.<eos> An advanced grasp of the mathematics of probability, mapped onto a thorough apprehension of human psychology and the known dispositions of any given individual, can reduce the number of variables considerably.<eos> I myself know of at least 58 techniques to refine a seemingly infinite array of randomly generated possibilities down to the smallest number of feasible variables.<eos> But they're really difficult, so instead I just stuck a tracer on the inside of the memory stick.<eos> Oh, you bastard!
So many lies.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> And I don't just mean you.<eos> What?<eos> Alex, Gabriel, Ajay... You're R?
So why do you want to kill me?<eos> Do you know how long they kept me prisoner? What they did to me?<eos> They tortured Alex to death.<eos> I can still hear the sound of his back breaking.<eos> But you?
Then there was the Tbilisi incident. AGRA went in.<eos> And they were betrayed. Not by me.<eos> Mycroft, we have known each other a long time.<eos> I promise you, I haven't the foggiest idea what all this is about.<eos> You wound up AGRA and all the other freelancers.
Death.<eos> Hello, Mary. Hey. John?<eos> On his way.<eos> Let me introduce Ammo.<eos> You were Ammo?
Hello, Mary. Hey. John?<eos> On his way.<eos> Let me introduce Ammo.<eos> You were Ammo?<eos> You were the person on the phone that time?
Miss Sharon Christine Turner, I believe.<eos> Scout.<eos> Any plans for tonight, Professor Allen?<eos> - I'm so glad you asked that.<eos> - I'm glad you're glad.
- Dinner.<eos> How's that for a dramatic opening image?<eos> It is kind of cool, isn't it?<eos> Maybe, if we knew what it was.<eos> - And who you are.
And you two will help me translate what these writings actually mean if indeed writings is what they are.<eos> - In all likelihood. - That's what we do.<eos> We're going to need textural laser scans of the surface.<eos> Of course. I've already ordered them.<eos> - That's what you do.
Check the readouts.<eos> Shazam.<eos> All right, here, let me have that.<eos> Well, now that is very interesting.<eos> You really are linked to our little project, aren't you?
- To science?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Well, that's not going to happen.<eos> Give me your gun.<eos> So you and I are going to continue our little walk alone.
- Just shut the hell up.<eos> Don't say another word to me.<eos> Got it?<eos> Got it.<eos> Oh, you got to be kidding me.
We're moving on.<eos> Without you. Cutting you out.<eos> Literally.<eos> You can show up for cheer practice if you want, but I wouldn't.<eos> [Kimberly's father] Oh, my God, what have you done?
Okay!<eos> Ah, she's back again. [chuckles]<eos> Oh, crazy girl.<eos> Just like clockwork.<eos> Who are you?
- [Trini] Get off of me.<eos> Just jump over.<eos> Let's go. Jump with me.<eos> Yeah. [Billy] No, no, no! Don't-don't jump.<eos> - I'm gonna jump across with her, and then you jump, okay?
- No! You speak for all of them.<eos> You know that, deep down, what I'm saying is true.<eos> You were born for this.<eos> You all waited.<eos> Even you.
- I can go home and get that.<eos> - Jason, you need me out of this wall.<eos> To help lead this team!<eos> Your team's dead.<eos> And you're just as scared as we are.
Boom goes the lunchbox, in detention goes Billy.<eos> But let's not forget that Kimberly Hart was also in... in detention, too, so...<eos> Not tonight.<eos> Skip me.<eos> What about you, dude?
Skip me.<eos> What about you, dude?<eos> Why don't you tell us who you really are?<eos> Because everyone knows exactly who I am.<eos> Okay. What about you, crazy girl?
I haven't really been honest.<eos> I punched Ty Fleming in the face because he told everyone I was the meanest person he'd ever met.<eos> And he was right.<eos> Well, that can't be true. Okay.<eos> - You took that picture?
- You took that picture?<eos> - No. Amanda Clark took that picture.<eos> Of herself. But she shared it with me.<eos> She trusted me.<eos> And you sent that pic to... to Ty?
Yellow has led you to your deaths.<eos> - Because I'm going to kill you, one by one, until you tell me, where is my crystal?<eos> We don't know.<eos> No, Red.<eos> You don't know!
[Blue Ranger] That might have been my fault.<eos> I'm sorry, y'all. [Red Ranger] I think Kimberly needs to move our feet.<eos> - No, I've got the arm.<eos> - Uh, no, I do. I've got the leg.<eos> - You're a leg, too?
Is that Principal Feig?<eos> No, I... I don't think he can see me.<eos> Oh, let's wiggle, Jason.<eos> [laughing] [Blue Ranger] I call this the algebra.<eos> Woo! [Pink Ranger] How do you even do that?
when I look around, i see a beautiful country,<eos> I see land, Springs, houses, and then there's you and me.<eos> And we have everything we need.<eos> Everything else, we can build.<eos> Just you and I together.
You're not looking for the living, you're marking the dead.<eos> Will you just come home?<eos> Baby, we can work on this together.<eos> There's no home here.<eos> You, me, nails.
Yeah.<eos> The guy's wound pretty tight.<eos> Well, the man's a decorated war hero.<eos> That's the package they come in.<eos> And you?
Isn't shooting a mapping mission a step down for a photojournalist?<eos> The right photo can help shape opinions.<eos> And win you a Pulitzer.<eos> Okay, captain Conrad.<eos> What about you?
- You take cash?<eos> - Not cash, no.<eos> Taking your own life.<eos> Interesting expression, taking it from who?<eos> Once it's over, it's not you who'll miss it.
Mrs Hudson?<eos> He thinks you're clever, poor old Sherlock.<eos> Always going on about you.<eos> I mean, he knows you're an idiot, but that's OK, cos you're a lovely doctor.<eos> But he has no idea what an idiot you are!
'If he thinks you need him, I swear...'<eos> And off we... pop.<eos> '...he will be there.'<eos> Mr Holmes, are you OK?<eos> What were you doing to him? ! What were you doing?
- On what?<eos> - Saline.<eos> - Saline?<eos> - Yes, saline.<eos> What do you mean, saline?
Sorry!<eos> Must be something comforting about the number three, people always give up after three.<eos> What?<eos> What is it? What?<eos> - You cock!
Seriously, we're not going to - talk about this?<eos> - Talk about what?<eos> I mean, how does it work?<eos> How does what work?<eos> You and The Woman.
Do you go to a discreet Harvester sometimes?<eos> Is there nights of passion in High Wycombe?<eos> Oh, for God's sakes, I don't text her back!<eos> Why not?<eos> You bloody moron!
Oh, for God's sakes, I don't text her back!<eos> Why not?<eos> You bloody moron!<eos> She's out there, she likes you and she's alive!<eos> And do you have the first idea how lucky you are?
Her, I mean. Woman.<eos> Bad idea.<eos> Try not to, but, you know, sometimes...<eos> It's not a pleasant thought, John, but I have this terrible feeling from time to time that we might all just be human.<eos> - Even you? - No.
Bad idea.<eos> Try not to, but, you know, sometimes...<eos> It's not a pleasant thought, John, but I have this terrible feeling from time to time that we might all just be human.<eos> - Even you? - No.<eos> Even you.
We have time, brother dear.<eos> All the time in the world.<eos> Mycroft?<eos> Who are you?<eos> You know.
Sherlock?<eos> Help me!<eos> Experiment complete.<eos> Conclusion, I have a sister.<eos> This was you?
Help me!<eos> Experiment complete.<eos> Conclusion, I have a sister.<eos> This was you?<eos> All of this was you?
Someone?<eos> Probably me.<eos> So, that's it, is it?<eos> You're just going?<eos> Well, don't worry, there's a place for people like you, the desperate, the terrified.
Pure and simple.<eos> Who was it said, "The truth is rarely pure and never simple"?<eos> I don't know and I don't care.<eos> So, there were three of us, I know that now.<eos> You, me and Eurus.
Then we move.<eos> What's the trigger response time?<eos> Once we're mobile, how long before detonation?<eos> We have a maximum of three seconds to vacate the blast radius.<eos> John and I will take the windows, you take the stairs.
Yes, it does!<eos> It justifies dressing up or any damn thing I say it does!<eos> Now, listen to me, for your own physical safety, do not speak.<eos> Do not indulge in any non-verbal signals suggestive of internal thought!<eos> If the safety of my sister is compromised, if the security of my sister is compromised, if the incarceration of my sister is compromised, in short, if I find any indication my sister has left this island at any time, I swear to you, you will not!
'We have evolved to attach an emotional significance 'to what is nothing more than a survival strategy of the pack animal.<eos> 'We are conditioned to invest divinity in utility.<eos> 'Good isn't really good, evil isn't really wrong, 'bottoms aren't really pretty.<eos> You are a prisoner of your own meat.<eos> 'Why aren't you?
- It's a gift.<eos> - Who from?<eos> - Me.<eos> - Why?<eos> - You play, don't you?
Afraid I didn't notice in the heat of the moment.<eos> And afterwards, well, you couldn't really tell.<eos> Is that vibrato, or is your hand shaking?<eos> I warned you explicitly, no-one was to talk to her alone.<eos> - You spoke to her.
- Do it.<eos> Step closer.<eos> Tell me what you remember.<eos> You, me and Mycroft.<eos> He could understand things if you went a bit slow, but you, you were my favourite.
Hello?<eos> Oh, dear. We seem to have lost the connection.<eos> How have you done this?<eos> How is any of this possible?<eos> You put me in here, Mycroft, you brought me my treats.
Oh!<eos> What advantage did your moral code grant you?<eos> Is it not, in the end, selfish to keep one's hands clean at the expense of another's life?<eos> You didn't have to kill her!<eos> Huh! The condition of her survival was that you or Mycroft had to kill her husband.
No cuts, no scarring.<eos> It's not Nathan, then.<eos> Who's next?<eos> Well done, Dr Watson.<eos> How useful you are.
'Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock, 'tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tick...'<eos> - What's she doing?<eos> - She's making tea.<eos> But why isn't she answering her phone?<eos> You never answer your phone.
- Leave me alone. - Molly, no, please, no!<eos> Don't hang up!<eos> Do not hang up!<eos> Calmly, Sherlock, or I will finish her right now.<eos> Why are you doing this to me?
Because... because it's true.<eos> Because... it's true, Sherlock.<eos> It's always been true.<eos> Well, if it's true, just say it anyway.<eos> You bastard!
It's always been true.<eos> Well, if it's true, just say it anyway.<eos> You bastard!<eos> 'Say it anyway.'<eos> 'You say it.
- Shoot him!<eos> - What?<eos> Shoot Dr Watson.<eos> There's no question who has to continue from here, it's us.<eos> You and me.
I can see a river.<eos> - There's... there's... there's a big wheel.<eos> - All right.<eos> Well, you and I are going to have to drive this plane together.<eos> Just you and me.
The game, yes, I get it now.<eos> The song was never a set of directions.<eos> I'm in the plane.<eos> I'm going to crash.<eos> And you're going to save me.
I'm lost, lost in the sky and... no-one can hear me.<eos> Open your eyes.<eos> I'm here.<eos> You're not lost anymore.<eos> Now, you... you just, you just went the wrong way last time, that's all.
She won't communicate with anyone in any way.<eos> She has passed beyond our view.<eos> There are no words that can reach her now.<eos> Sherlock?<eos> Well? You were always the grown-up.
What's going on?<eos> It's an invasion!<eos> It's a play date!<eos> That's a keeper.<eos> It's a meeting, and you won't be attending.
Run, run, run.<eos> Catch, catch, catch.<eos> Yes!<eos> Oh, yeah!<eos> Let go, you little...
Where did everyone go?<eos> Mom, Dad!<eos> The baby can talk!<eos> Oh, can he now?<eos> Wait, how did you...
I don't want your filthy money.<eos> Look, I told you to stay out of my way.<eos> I can't!<eos> You're in my house.<eos> I don't wanna be here... any more than you want me to be here.
Going upsies!<eos> So how come I don't remember this place?<eos> You did.<eos> But after normal babies get their pacifiers taken away... you forget all about Baby Corp.<eos> How come you're not normal?
- Not pumpkin.<eos> - Okay. That's a vegetable.<eos> Point is, the puppies' slice is getting bigger and bigger.<eos> They're stealing all our love!<eos> Just like you did to me.
Every birthday party... I'll be there.<eos> Every Christmas! I'll be there<eos> Year after year after year.<eos> We will grow old together.<eos> You and I... will be brothers.
It's not even Friday!<eos> Come on, you're putting this thing on!<eos> You gonna make me?<eos> You can't make me, punk.<eos> - What have you done to me? - Stop!
- What have you done to me? - Stop!<eos> - Get back here! - No!<eos> No way.<eos> Come on!<eos> Tim, what are you doing in here?
But they replaced me with someone new.<eos> Someone younger.<eos> That's horrible.<eos> All of a sudden, she got all the love... all the attention.<eos> You know how that feels, don't you, Tim?
