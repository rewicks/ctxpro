- Angels!<eos> I bring glad tidings.<eos> I have the solution... to your problem.<eos> Oh, which one?<eos> The one that brought you to Ch√¢teau Bug in the middle of the night.
- Angels!<eos> I bring glad tidings.<eos> I have the solution... to your problem.<eos> Oh, which one?<eos> The one that brought you to Chateau Bug in the middle of the night.
Listen to me. There ain't no fire.<eos> There's a guard out there going full-on San Bernardino.<eos> This is where you want to be.<eos> Until he bursts in and we're all sitting ducks.<eos> I'll keep you safe.
I thought it was obvious.<eos> I am giving you a chance to tell your side of the story before my side becomes the only side.<eos> You were the one who rescued us five years ago.<eos> That's because you wouldn't tell me the truth and you ended up in an underground bunker.<eos> So why don't you let me help you now?
Thank you, Jimmy.<eos> Tell your friends, even if they already have a will... it's important to get it updated, just like you did.<eos> - I'll tell them.<eos> - Now, you remember Francesca.<eos> She'll take care of you the rest of the way.
- Want some?<eos> It's good.<eos> Salty.<eos> Slurpy.<eos> Naw, I'm not hungry, but I'm gonna grab a beer and come join you.
He'll crush you with one hand.<eos> Father got careless. That's what Mama says.<eos> Will you shut up about Mama?<eos> "Mama, Mama, Mama."<eos> Maybe I'll kill you both before we take King's Landing.
The math ain't that hard.<eos> What's with the boxes, Louis?<eos> This is everything the firm has ever done for Couture Apparel.<eos> You're taking us to your annual meeting?<eos> I'm not just taking you.
Charles, speak to me, please.<eos> Speak to your mother.<eos> Help!<eos> Help, we need help now!<eos> The good Lord will always forgive you.
Not more than a glimpse.<eos> It was never something that could last for days.<eos> It could never last for years.<eos> Step forward.<eos> Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord and He shall lift you up.
All right...<eos> Coming in.<eos> Okay.<eos> Why don't we do this:<eos> When I point at you, you tell me your name, and if you have any special skills or hidden talents, favorite sex positions.
Move, come on.<eos> We're not coming back here.<eos> Wait in the car.<eos> What are you...<eos> Hey, if you get out, the alarm will go off, and if you try and run and hide, I'll find you.
Fucking white, right-wing idiots.<eos> Someone's grumpier than usual.<eos> We lost the venue.<eos> - The lady just called me an hour ago.<eos> So, now I'm here to drink and not be alone before I never see any of you again.
Why?<eos> Because Dr. Eldredge is already pissed you're here.<eos> You're doing fancy, expensive surgery.<eos> Special treatment gets the others all riled up, you know.<eos> Eldredge pushes you, you push back.
Girl, I got you.<eos> Everything's gonna be ok.<eos> You can't let a few a-holes get to you.<eos> Hi ladies.<eos> What brings you to the women's centre today?
Well, I don't like it.<eos> Look.<eos> You have chosen this path.<eos> Life works in strange ways.<eos> Your choices have clearly led you here, as have mine.
Okay, open it and scan the space like you're waving a metal detector.<eos> But we have to go off comms.<eos> - Why?<eos> - The app detects frequencies and it could interfere... just trust me.<eos> I'll switch you off on our end, but I'll check back in in 90 seconds.
Thank you.<eos> - Hey, is Jake Harper here?<eos> - Pool table.<eos> We need to ask you a couple of questions.<eos> Let me guess... my girlfriend sent you?
Yeah.<eos> That's scary.<eos> It is scary.<eos> But that cop was wrong, and what he did was bad.<eos> And the most important thing is your daddy's okay, and he's not in trouble, and he loves you both more than anything in the world. Okay?
Yeah. I can't even be...<eos> Like, now that I'm an adult, I can't even be mad at him.<eos> I'm mad at people that hid him and let him, you know...<eos> It's just unbelievable.<eos> Were either of you called to the nurse's office?
So...<eos> And how many of those mother box things do you guys carry around with you anyway?<eos> That information is classified.<eos> - No less than 2,000 at all times.<eos> - Okay, look, you ladies seem nice-ish. But I'm sending you to...
You got it?<eos> Excuse me!<eos> Excuse me!<eos> We're not open.<eos> - Can I help you?
The mayor thanks you, of course.<eos> Privately, so don't tell anyone.<eos> Can I walk you out?<eos> Well, why don't you all go get some rest?<eos> These gentlemen here will get you out of here.
Yes.<eos> -I'm trying.<eos> -Good.<eos> Let us thank Katya for the work she's done.<eos> And that's all for today, I'll see you at the next session.
- Who am I supposed to be?<eos> - I feel like I'm going to pass oot.<eos> And now Colleen M.'s having hot flashes.<eos> Ms. Wicklund: You're on a new phone plan now. girls.<eos> Unlimited minutes. unlimited looks to the world around you.
You know.<eos> Your father. who's name I think is Bob Collette.<eos> They are having a heck of a time getting in touch with that man.<eos> He's in Niagara Falls.<eos> The RCMP will not let your mommy bail you out of here because the RCMP don't ever let. Eh. serial killers out on bail.
Can we have our phones back now?<eos> You want your phones?<eos> No. I didn't steal your phones.<eos> You didn't get our phones?<eos> Do you mean that when I was illegally breaking you out of the jail that I forgot to steal your precious telephones.
Just tell me when.<eos> They said that... Crying showed an emotional commitment to a team that surpassed the personal awareness of a recruit with five times my experience.<eos> They want me to start training with the CIA.<eos> Ladies. I know I don't deserve a second chance.<eos> I asked you to be great and then I abandoned you.
On Sundays for church and that.<eos> Well, there's no rush.<eos> Oh. I'm foolin'.<eos> Come here.<eos> If y'all need anything, or he ain't treatin' you right, you let me know.
What?<eos> You can confirm with your superiors, but I'm sending protective detail to your location right now to take care of you and Carly.<eos> If Carly's father's coming here, if he's dangerous, then I need to know.<eos> Carly's father is a good man.<eos> That's not why we're moving you.
You fucking piece of shit!<eos> You fucking dick!<eos> Back me into a fucking corner!<eos> You wanna play victim, you fucking dick?<eos> I will fuck you up!
- Meow!<eos> Are you gossiping?<eos> No gossip allowed!<eos> Go to HR!<eos> I've called you both in because I hear you've been having problems.
Anybody seen Crazy?<eos> Not since her and her cuckoo compadre stepped on my sandcastle.<eos> I know they didn't mean to, but still.<eos> -What did you say?<eos> -I said, "Run, because if I catch you, I'll kill you."
He can never do this again in life.<eos> He is straight-legged for the rest of his life.<eos> You can deal with this right here?<eos> This ain't gonna fuck with you every day?<eos> Every goddamn day, this ain't gonna fuck with you?
This ain't gonna fuck with you every day?<eos> Every goddamn day, this ain't gonna fuck with you?<eos> Looking at this?<eos> Butt-ass naked, going to the bathroom like this.<eos> This ain't gonna fuck with you?
We expect all our students to follow -- is everything all right?<eos> There's an issue we've had to address involving Taylor.<eos> There were pictures posted of your son which were outside the code.<eos> Pictures of what?<eos> I can't show you.
How old are you, Nishadi?<eos> My sister is 13.<eos> Do you have any more bruises?<eos> CAMERA CLICKS - What about your sister?<eos> Why did he tie you up?
In the name of the Father- of the Son - and of the Holy Ghost.<eos> Communion!<eos> I want the Communion!<eos> I want to cleanse my soul, I don't want to go to hell!<eos> I've seen you!
Please, can you help us?<eos> My brother is missing.<eos> We help find Ama's grandson.<eos> Ama was friend to us.<eos> He says, spirits of the forest send you here.
Look, I'm not a misogynistic pig.<eos> I think women should judge men equally and harshly.<eos> You know what never fails?<eos> Judge men based on what they drive.<eos> Ladies... if a guy picks you up in a minivan, he is telling you,
Don't be an asshole and put it on high speed the first time.<eos> You'll send him to the emergency room.<eos> But... Ease into it.<eos> One, two, three. He'll be like, all right!<eos> I'm not piling on you for not doing enough, if you're a woman.
Hi.<eos> Mike was just telling us about your warehouse.<eos> That's awful.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Oh, you're gonna be when I sue you.
Ordering you to seduce me.<eos> Your cryptographers are breathing too much of their own ink.<eos> They're imagining things.<eos> And letters from her to your aide, Jeffrey, ordering him to watch her every move.<eos> I can show you, if you need proof, but I don't think you do.
- and stories and...<eos> - Molly!<eos> Yup!<eos> Okay, all right.<eos> Well, I'll leave you to it.
Here you go.<eos> Ooh. A little something to loosen your inhibitions.<eos> Oh, don't worry.<eos> We're plenty loose already.<eos> Not after I've tied you up.
Good-bye, Emily.<eos> That was rough, you guys.<eos> I know, but you did it.<eos> I'm so proud of you.<eos> Well, anyway, I'll leave you to your girls' night.
I want it so clean that we could eat novelty sundaes out of it!<eos> Now!<eos> Now...<eos> I am going to find out what happened to Hester if it's the last thing I do.<eos> And if it turns out that you three harbored a known serial killer, I am going to report you as accessories to murder.
Now!<eos> Now...<eos> I am going to find out what happened to Hester if it's the last thing I do.<eos> And if it turns out that you three harbored a known serial killer, I am going to report you as accessories to murder.<eos> And when they sentence you to the electric chair, I'm gonna stand there and watch you fry.
- Lisa: Truth. What's going on?<eos> Lisa's kicking me off the team.<eos> What? Lis... No, you can't do that.<eos> How about we don't do any of this?<eos> Do you need me to separate you?
Planning on making a pilgrimage to Jerusalem.<eos> Get my pray on.<eos> Where y'all ladies from anyway?<eos> - New Orleans.<eos> TTD put you up to this.
It's the car.<eos> No way.<eos> Well, you two sure know how to ruin a surprise.<eos> So how long have you been following us?<eos> I wasn't following you.... specifically.
Oh, thank goodness. (laughs)<eos> Come on in.<eos> Jennifer knew the name of the street, but not the address.<eos> So we parked, prayed, and followed the screams.<eos> Donna: I wasn't expecting you.
Why are you asking?<eos> - Well...did something happen?<eos> What?<eos> - No...<eos> Is someone troubling you in person or making calls at odd hours?
Bob, how's your head?<eos> - No complaints.<eos> [laughter] - Welcome, ladies. I've made some decisions.<eos> [dramaticelectronicmusic]<eos> Les Chicken Wings, the crowd ate you up, but one of you was finger-licking great.
This is ridiculous.<eos> They've lost, they know it, and they're just trying to stall.<eos> Then you should have thought of that before you decided to drop this bomb in my courtroom.<eos> Mr. Specter, you have three days.<eos> I wasn't expecting you so soon.
Tash is just a personality I made up so I could finally fit in.<eos> There's nothing wrong with who you are.<eos> I guess you're right.<eos> Why are you being so nice to me?<eos> After the way I treated you, you must hate me.
- To find her.<eos> - How? The way you find Cinderella.<eos> With her shoe.<eos> So, your little science experiment can really tell us why the Evil Queen is still alive and how to destroy her?<eos> It's a possibility if I can re-create the serum that split you.
- Oh, come on, Phil.<eos> Make up your mind.<eos> You want to be Director or not?<eos> 'Cause I'm not some meat puppet who's just gonna smile and roll over on command.<eos> No one's asking you to roll over, but you do have a nice smile.
You know, in fact, I was about to do one right now.<eos> Hey... hey, girls.<eos> It's me, Daddy.<eos> If you're seeing this, I'm dead.<eos> But I want you to know that I love you now and forever.
How do you know that?<eos> The fact is, we know that one of you sitting here is the mole.<eos> I just don't know which one.<eos> So, I have three minutes to find out who is with the Cause and who is innocent.<eos> And if I can't figure it out, the recommended step is that I kill both of you.
- Come on, y'all.<eos> Say, bye, Derek.<eos> Mm-mm, mm-mm.<eos> So... you're like our new mother now?<eos> Your foster parents treating you all right?
- Truly genius.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - She's right, and I'm in.<eos> - Of course.<eos> Okay, well, I'm too tired to strip, and I'm hungry. So... see you at home.
THE OTHERS WILL TRY AGAIN TONIGHT.<eos> POUR THE OIL!<eos> THE ANTI-CHRIST AND THE DEVILS ARE HERE.<eos> I PRAY TO GOD AND OUR HOLY MOTHER THAT THEY WILL NOT GET IN.<eos> BUT IF, GOD FORBID, THEY WERE TO DO SO, MAKE SURE THEY DO NOT CAPTURE YOU ALIVE.
That's the young lady's governess.<eos> Governess?<eos> She's a very distinguished woman who looks affer Miss Klara.<eos> So behave yourself!<eos> Miss Rottenmeier will see you now. - Right.
Let us on the boat!<eos> You bitches!<eos> Bitches?<eos> Why don't you burn in hell, Bruce?<eos> We will track you down and find you!
Good evening.<eos> - Oh, welcome!<eos> - Good evening!<eos> Good evening!<eos> I think this is the first time I've seen you all here at once!
King Hermie and his big baddie.<eos> I want her for another hour.<eos> So these are both your ribs.<eos> And your hearts would be inside.<eos> This is the band of muscles that connect the two of you.
Well, if only one of you were born in Minsk, that would be a miracle.<eos> Our father didn't want us and sold us to circus when we were babies.<eos> We went from one to the next.<eos> Prague, Bologna, Marseilles, then Blackpool where Mr. Brockhurst bought and bring us here.<eos> How does he treat you?
Now, remember this as you face this year's trial of faith.<eos> Which we are totally gonna pass with perfection this year, right, girls?<eos> It's, like, the main activity of camp.<eos> I've never done one, but imagine a Sunday school lesson taught by Indiana Jones.<eos> Each of you are as unique and beautiful as the many animals on the ark, so we've put you into twos, and you're going to choose a spirit animal and then discuss why you chose that animal.
Good to know.<eos> You know, we have a station just two miles up this path if you need anything.<eos> I do need to warn you, there have been some reports of bears around, so just be careful.<eos> - Ooh, uh-huh. - Of course.<eos> And if you do come across a black bear, do not play dead 'cause it will eat you.
Temporarily.<eos> They have food, a place to sleep.<eos> They even have a school for diplomat's kids.<eos> I'm sure they'll take the girls until things calm down.<eos> Okay, Kittredge isn't gonna exactly welcome you with open arms.
I assure you, it will not.<eos> I imagine I am free to leave.<eos> Yes, yes, for now.<eos> Oh! Miss Parks...<eos> I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to stay a little longer.
By the power vested in me as an adult who is a grown-up, you're grounded.<eos> Okay. Kimmy, IMHO...<eos> Pancakes.<eos> Got it.<eos> This is not gonna work, 'cause nannies like you... I chew you up, and I spit you out, just like all my food.
Move!<eos> Now!<eos> Hands above your head.<eos> Ladies, move. Turn around slowly.<eos> Don't say I didn't warn you.
I think I might have skills that could be useful to you.<eos> Really?<eos> What skills, exactly?<eos> All kinds.<eos> You protect me from these animals, and I'll show you.
You're what we ghosts refer to as "solids."<eos> Solids?<eos> Her story checks out.<eos> Most ghosts have never even seen outsiders from the Monster World.<eos> They'd probably be pretty scared if they saw you.
Planning something!<eos> And then I got caught and she has all these detention chains, and then Porter...<eos> And then he told me exactly where to find all of you. (CACKLING)<eos> He told you?<eos> Oh, yes, I offered to reduce his detention for good behavior and so he gave you up, very easily.
- No, no, no!<eos> We're breaking out, out, out, out, into the world.<eos> You're breaking up with me.<eos> Sweetie, it's time.<eos> So, who's gonna take care of you when you're old?
Then, I was selected.<eos> Before I knew it, I was accepting the offer.<eos> Deep inside, I don't think of myself as a teacher, but as an actor.<eos> But, if you allow me to tell you my excuse...<eos> If I hadn't met all of you,
Good evening.<eos> Ann, my daughter.<eos> Michel Racine, presiding judge in Criminal Court.<eos> Ann surprised me...<eos> Am I bothering you?
Honey, I'm just as upset as you are.<eos> And I want you to know you will not be charged for that room.<eos> I cannot stay in this place one more second!<eos> The police will be coming soon.<eos> You can either give them a statement here or you can talk to them later in jail when they arrest you for evasion.
You wanna get some lunch?<eos> Well, they both think I'm a skunk now.<eos> Gotta get back on track here, gotta do something.<eos> Think, think, think, you damn skunk.<eos> All right, ladies, this skunk has obviously offended you...
Listen, I got slugged by the bad seed.<eos> It's nothing.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Okay.<eos> The doctor will be with you.
No, uh, go to the courthouse.<eos> I will petition for time with Judge Cuesta.<eos> - And I'll meet you there.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - I'll meet you there, too.
This piece of shit whore is the daughter you raised, hmm?<eos> Are you proud, Momma, of the cum jug you gave birth to?<eos> You put your family on a plane and you fly as far away from here as you can.<eos> You understand?<eos> If I ever see your faces again, I will cut you into pieces and feed you to my dogs.
However, you got to get out of here.<eos> See, in this town, that sound means trouble.<eos> Do you know where we can find Snow White?<eos> Snow?<eos> She finds you.
Camille saw them?<eos> She's upstairs with Lena.<eos> She's devastated, Jack.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Hey, nobody saw you.
Max, I can barely keep myself alive.<eos> This morning, I had to jump-start my heart by putting my finger in the socket Tom and Jerry style.<eos> Oh, hello.<eos> So what did you girls do today?<eos> I haven't seen you since right here last night.
I'm smelling a $100 bill.<eos> It's from my other restaurant.<eos> It buys me nice things.<eos> Jealous?<eos> I took you in when you had no one.
And the penis-shaped pasta?<eos> I'll do it all.<eos> I can handle the slammer, but Caroline doesn't stand a chance.<eos> I saw a woman looking at her like she was a cartoon pork chop.<eos> Okay. Well, I'll see you soon.
We were tamping down our feelings for your sake.<eos> We don't hate you.<eos> We love you.<eos> And you look so beautiful in your dress.<eos> I love you too.
But you defied the odds by having others secretly help you 'cause you didn't have what it took.<eos> That's not my story.<eos> But now we're the underdogs, and we're the ones who need a handout, so just tell us the answer.<eos> Or have you forgotten where you come from?<eos> I'm not gonna help you.
But tonight we're gonna make an exception because I assume a lot of you - are probably first-time offenders.<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> In order to let you go, we need to identify the men that organized this game.<eos> If we do that, you can all be on your merry way.<eos> And if we cannot do that, you are all gonna get locked up, and we can figure it out tonight in a jail cell, and, ladies, that includes you, too. Understood?
You've been doing this a long time.<eos> I know that.<eos> That's right, I've been doing this a long time, like my father before me.<eos> Then you know the rules!<eos> We didn't mix 'em up on you all of a sudden!
I don't think you guys can even protect me the rest of the way to Ventura. ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Cabe!<eos> Over here, over here.<eos> Ladies.<eos> I only want one of you.<eos> But I'll kill all three of you.
~ I'll try.<eos> ~ Thank you very much.<eos> We'll make ourselves scarce.<eos> Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in our midst... ~ and soliciting my son's help. ~ (LAUGHS)<eos> Erm... I'll catch up with you both in a minute.
Well, if it isn't Alfred Einstein!<eos> I can't believe you got off of your butt, put your feet to the ground, and you actually showed up.<eos> Get over here. Oh!<eos> Joanie and Haley?<eos> Wh... you girls must have aged 100 years since I last saw you.
And I can see that you don't trust me.<eos> The beauty is... you don't need to.<eos> See for yourself.<eos> I didn't make that bomb.<eos> Whoever did found out that you're after him and he is playing you.
I'm not looking for trouble.<eos> Neither am I.<eos> Edward, Clementine.<eos> I have news from Vega.<eos> I'm sorry to be the one to tell you, but Vega has fallen into civil war.
Here it is.<eos> The slippers are for inside.<eos> Don't take them out.<eos> Mineral water and soft drinks are in the refrigerator.<eos> If you use them, they'll charge you.
They want to drink expensive wine, so they won't pay back the money.<eos> This crazy bitch.<eos> They're having so much fun with the money they got by selling their bodies.<eos> Wait until you're past your prime.<eos> No one will want you anymore. Did you know that?
Because all of your real issues then end up getting subverted And coming out in all these passive-aggressive ways.<eos> Sound familiar?<eos> So...<eos> I want you both to make lists.<eos> Everything you love about each other... And everything that drives you nuts.
He should be distracted for at least an hour.<eos> -Very impressive.<eos> -Thanks!<eos> Let's bolt before he catches on.<eos> Oh, wow. Okay, yeah. Uh, since NOV-Eight asked me to guide you through this, here's lesson number one, secret agents don't bounce.
Oh, don't be such a worrywart.<eos> You're wasting your time.<eos> I like to live on the edge.<eos> I'm famous and I like to speak my mind.<eos> If I had a pound for every time someone threatened my life, I could take you all to space with me.
Yeah, well, you know what?<eos> At least i didn't show That sake commercial you did in japan.<eos> Remember the tag line was "sake to me, sexy boys."<eos> [ chuckles ] you messed with the wrong lady, lady.<eos> I will get you for this.
I'll look into the address.<eos> Run the description through the database.<eos> Meanwhile, you got to turn two.<eos> Wait.<eos> You said if I helped you out, you would see what you could do.
Crap.<eos> Hello.<eos> This year was a banner year for us Belcher kids.<eos> We did so many nice things.<eos> Too many to list, so we're going to sing them to you.
I want to die.<eos> I'm afraid that this curse after your daughter Zeynep.<eos> That's probably cause of your nightmares and worries.<eos> Because, her voices echoes through the village now.<eos> Curse wouldn't let you in peace.
Look, look!<eos> Yeah, yeah. I saw that.<eos> Hi!<eos> Hi.<eos> The theater group invites you to the Christmas tree lighting on Friday. Are you coming?
It was probably a fish or something. No, fish don't grab people!<eos> Maybe you should get out of the water.<eos> Got you!<eos> You bastard!<eos> Sorry, ladies, if I scared you.
I got cancer, imagine that!<eos> I can do your hair, if you want, I'm really good.<eos> Thanks anyway, but I'm going to be bald.<eos> I make great wigs, it's free for you!<eos> I'd pay you, I don't want a thing from you.
- Totally forgiven.<eos> Well, I'm gonna crush those classes.<eos> Ladies!<eos> Good to see you.<eos> If you want I can sneak you into the after-party.
- That's the problem with chronic pain.<eos> Okay, I think we need some closure... with what happened to Nina last month... because we all cared so much for her.<eos> It's going to be hard, but I am going to sit here and pretend to be Nina.<eos> And as you feel led,<eos> I want you to verbalize to me... to Nina... how her suicide affected you.
He actually listened, not like Australian men.<eos> He was always very popular with the women.<eos> Was he?<eos> It wasn't that he was terribly good-looking, even.<eos> It was just that he listened to you?
He's always waiting to reach out for you!<eos> For me!<eos> A broken heart!<eos> He's so angry!<eos> - He will take you there, all of you!
He wants his baby!<eos> - Time to rest.<eos> - No!<eos> - Time to rest, Isabelle.<eos> - No, he will get you!
I charge this letter not only as malfeasance but also treason.<eos> Guards, remove this well-fed Judas to the Bargello.<eos> This is outrageous!<eos> This melanzana deceived us!<eos> I'll...get...you...back...
'Have you found them? '<eos> Not yet.<eos> 'Paul... '<eos> Wait just a little longer.<eos> I'll call you as soon as I do.
Hey!<eos> - so you get...<eos> - Nothing!<eos> Do not Willy Wonka me.<eos> You want to know why I've never invited you to where I work?
Perry sommers.<eos> Number two hundred...<eos> Angela Maria Perez,<eos> The eyes of the world are upon you.<eos> History has chosen you.
Nurse Nightingale.<eos> Mrs. Akalitus will see you now.<eos> Big fan.<eos> The rest of you, try to keep it to 16 bars.<eos> The accompanist will cut you off.
Next stop, New Goreleans!<eos> And I'm going with you.<eos> Really?<eos> That'd be totes appreciated.<eos> Mom and Dad would shed their fur if I didn't keep an eye on you ghouls.
No argument here.<eos> I was kind of hoping that you would come with me to get the thing that you take the morning after you're a complete idiot.<eos> The morning after pill.<eos> Of course.<eos> I thought I heard you two.
I like Tanaka-sensei.<eos> Why are you... so suddenly...?<eos> It's just... I thought that I could say it if it were to you two.<eos> though.<eos> He might even turn you both down.
You'll never guess!<eos> - Guess what?<eos> - The Guru, the Om, of high caste and extraordinary sanctity...<eos> The br√¢mane of Benares, the Great Teacher, - who do you think he is?<eos> - My dears, you needn't talk quite so loud, all Tilling will hear you.
In fact, you should probably take a look at this.<eos> It was in his locker, too.<eos> "Deferred compensation."<eos> Kind of like a pension.<eos> Cop gets to choose who the beneficiaries are, and Steve chose the both of you.
Cop gets to choose who the beneficiaries are, and Steve chose the both of you.<eos> So Angela will be taken care of?<eos> I'm not sure if he filed it.<eos> But it's obvious that he wanted the both of you to be taken care of.<eos> Do you think... he would've done that if he didn't love you very much?
Yeah.<eos> You know I just most of our fans have any interest in anything outside of watching our players play<eos> - basketball when that's...<eos> - Who gives a flying [Beep] about the fans?<eos> I just don't know how I'm supposed to help you today.
Max, please don't kill me.<eos> I can live here, but I can't die here.<eos> Hey, girls.<eos> I got Google glasses.<eos> See, right now, I'm looking at you and ordering tapioca on Amazon.
At least it's a famous name.<eos> People know it.<eos> Remember when we went to Disneyland?<eos> We were walking to the castle.<eos> I stopped and I watched you.
You're there.<eos> ~ And you're there.<eos> ~ He knows what's coming up.<eos> He can taste it in my milk.<eos> The only thing he can taste in your milk is all the vitamins the National Health are paying to put down you.
And he's not answering his phone.<eos> You think they could be there?<eos> I got... I got to go find out. Mm.<eos> I want you to stay with miss Leeds.<eos> I'll check with you later.
Who are you?<eos> I'm Bo, and this is my dad Tate.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> I saw you in my dream, so I came here to try to save you.
And we have learned, though this report has not yet been confirmed, that one of their own, possibly a Jupiter police detective, has himself been missing for two days.<eos> Reliable sources in the police department have circulated the clarion cry that,<eos> "No stone will be left unturned.<eos> The boys in blue are out for blood."<eos> This news report is brought to you...
We want the money now.<eos> And we also want the money that Gloria gave you when you sold us.<eos> This is blackmail.<eos> My, my, my.<eos> You girls have come a long way since I've rescued you from the hospital.
What are you talking about?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Plants!<eos> Don't get sick now.<eos> I will take care of you from now on.
But we have to go.<eos> Oh, I'll send some home with you.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Have you ever been so focused on something that it takes over everything else?<eos> Turns you into someone that you're not?
Robert was your father.<eos> I lied to you about him, too.<eos> Dad wasn't the man we thought he was.<eos> He was better.<eos> And I've kept something from you because I just... Never wanted you to know.
Huh?<eos> It's cold!<eos> Is that all you can do?<eos> You can't compete with my abilities!<eos> I will freeze you and bring you to our great ruler!
Charlie's not.<eos> I just dumped him.<eos> - What?<eos> - You should probably go console him since you know how that feels.<eos> Look, I don't know what they did to you people during hazing in Alpha Chi, but it really screwed you up.
What's his problem?<eos> Just ignore him.<eos> Ignore him.<eos> Listen to them, rutting like animals, taunting me with what I cannot have.<eos> All of you women who will not look at me or kiss me, giving yourselves to other men, giving sex to men who do not love you, who use your bodies.
Are you sure he will give it?<eos> No.<eos> I only know it'll haunt me forever if I don't try.<eos> You're a good man.<eos> Even though I'm uprooting our family, and taking you far from home?
So if somebody wanted to, say, track down where it came from, it wouldn't be too hard.<eos> I was a cop for a lot of years.<eos> Some habits die hard.<eos> A pawn shop.<eos> Who sent you?
These men, have nothing.<eos> It's just temporary, I'll find us a place.<eos> Good morning, gentlemen.<eos> All right, sit here.<eos> When I point to you, blankets off, get up, walk around. You know what to do.
I want to maybe talk to people that he knew on campus.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> Hey, Professor.<eos> I pulled those boxes we were talking about. Just let me know where you want them. Okay.<eos> I'll catch up with you.
What are you doing here?<eos> Lady Hummel called, begging us to do an emergency intervention.<eos> On who?<eos> You.<eos> You guys came all the way to New York just to talk to me because Kurt called you?
Shake me all over.<eos> Just like you, Sally, right?<eos> What I really need is to look less gawky.<eos> If I tell you something, will you return me the favour?<eos> I can give you the name of a person who's tailing you right now.
I am not Lady Mary.<eos> lam not an unwanted maid.<eos> Lady Mary is too old to continue in charge of the house.<eos> You may take up your duties on your return.<eos> Lord knows I'll need the two of you to keep each other out of trouble.
And you, uh... You're good?<eos> Apart from the fact that you blocked me from banging a fairy, and I'm about to go lose my crown in battle, thanks to my army being decimated?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Totally good.<eos> Smell you later, bitches.
They live, like, 20 people to one apartment.<eos> They have more kids than even the Irish.<eos> The men like their women with big titties, big asses.<eos> They're dirty, they're greasy, their food smells nasty and they're taking all our jobs.<eos> If y'all want a man representing you, be my fucking guest.
They don't live that way, honey.<eos> Gloria, give me the keys.<eos> We'll go to the market.<eos> Hey, you're all awake.<eos> I didn't hear you.
Could be.<eos> Ron Galuzzo.<eos> If he is a killer, then a mall is the perfect watering hole for him to choose his prey.<eos> So, um, any of our products is gonna make you stay in the shape that you are. Uh-huh.<eos> And, uh, I need to do some more work, so I'll see you a little bit later, okay?
Mattie here could use a small refrigerator.<eos> This is my sale.<eos> I'm sick to death of you scrimping on spending and then splashing out on whatever SHE wants!<eos> Oh, yes, that's right - pretend to be innocent.<eos> Ladies, ladies, I think we can find something that keeps you both happy.
Yeah, that's what this is.<eos> A connection.<eos> We were implanted by doctors, all of us.<eos> You split inside me into two baby girls.<eos> And I hid you because I felt you were in danger.
Please let us out!<eos> - How long have you been in here?<eos> - Months.<eos> Please. They're gonna kill us!<eos> - No one's gonna hurt you.
Geez!<eos> I don't care.<eos> All right.<eos> Yes, I'll come over tonight and I'll tell them that I'm moving back in.<eos> To keep that jerk-face boy from bothering you both.
Papa.<eos> Ashana was no fun...<eos> - Maisa, Papa is here.<eos> She kept complaining that all her children were gone.<eos> She missed you so much.
No.<eos> This is divine retribution.<eos> I'm gonna pee in my pants.<eos> Now when I say Jesus loves you, you say, "Yes!"<eos> Jesus loves you!
I'm gonna pee in my pants.<eos> Now when I say Jesus loves you, you say, "Yes!"<eos> Jesus loves you!<eos> Yes!<eos> Does Jesus love you?
[ Groans ] You beat us to it.<eos> We were gonna ask this kid if we could share.<eos> Well, he was just leaving.<eos> Yeah, you could totally sit with us.<eos> You know, I debated even putting you two on here.
-Don't think, Gina.<eos> Just do it.<eos> You want to be stacking boxes for the rest of your stay?<eos> You listen to what I'm telling you, you need to fuck with that kitchen.<eos> You fuck with this kitchen, I'll have you outta here so fast you'll think your ass grew wheels.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, mira, I got four kids, I know every trick there is.<eos> Now, I kept you here 'cause you know your shit.<eos> It's not your fault that Red lost the kitchen.<eos> But we all know this is one of the good jobs.<eos> Don't let Red take you down with her.
Forgive me intruding.<eos> My night's takings here for counting.<eos> Rose, meet Ida, newest to our home here.<eos> But fastest to our gentlemen's hearts already.<eos> Well, I should leave you to your business.
‚ô™ Never know how much I love you ‚ô™ ‚ô™ never know how much I care ‚ô™ when you put your arms around me ‚ô™<eos> Would've hated to be Mr. Benz when these three were in high school.<eos> After the show, I can introduce you, if you want.
Who says you can put up posters?<eos> Is that a problem for you?<eos> Will you lose sleep thinking about the poster?<eos> Don't bring that theatre crap here.<eos> If I see any of you here again, - - I'll take the gun and staple your pussy lips to the wall.
Who is that?<eos> I'm Officer Holbrooke.<eos> My partner and I are investigating the murders of Officer Reynolds and Detective Wilden.<eos> Just here to find out the truth.<eos> "The truth won't set you free, bitches."
And I want to spend more time at home with my pets.<eos> And I'm learning how to French braid.<eos> When I met you, you were eating lunch at school.<eos> So?<eos> So, see you tomorrow at lunch at school.
Right now?<eos> They'll never say yes!<eos> Pretty girls are for other guys.<eos> Watch this.<eos> If a couple of guys like us invited you on vacation with us...
He starts trying to drag her out the house.<eos> I was on the stairs, grabbed hold of her.<eos> He goes mental, starts waving the gun around.<eos> He's screaming at both of us, 'Get in the van, get in the van!<eos> Did he threaten you, hurt you?
Oh, Christ.<eos> - Oh, please. - Christ.<eos> Baby.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, I'm going to get you out.
Got to be.<eos> Gonna bury your dad.<eos> You can visit, bring him flowers.<eos> Lizzie, we're gonna have to talk about what happened in there.<eos> Your daddy asked me to protect you like you're my own and I will.
I remember when I was little, I'd always read the last page before...<eos> Can't stop thinking about Mona.<eos> We know "A" likes to play with us...<eos> But this time, I don't know what the game is.<eos> It's, "I'm going down and I'm dragging you with me."
I want to thank the person who opened my eyes... and who made all this possible:<eos> Checco.<eos> Good morning one and all.<eos> Comrades... I've struggled for you with passion for we must all fight injustice.<eos> I respect you both as workers and as women inasmuch as lesser... Wait! The protections you are owed, the "lesser" protections not you.
Because...<eos> She's a fair haven history buff.<eos> Right.<eos> Here's to our families... Finally coming together.<eos> In 1906, I was living in los angeles, And I tracked you down in san francisco.
Well, I guess that's one way.<eos> Oh, these aren't your soaps.<eos> They're gum.<eos> There you go, sweetie.<eos> So we'll see the two of you at two.
Whoa, this is like the coolest library I've ever been in !<eos> Clawdeen !<eos> Ghouls!<eos> Oh, no!<eos> Did Howleen send you here, too?
Break her leg if you must.<eos> We were never gonna do anything.<eos> It was just silly talk.<eos> It's because of my love for your plain faces that you can still draw breath.<eos> Be good, little birds, and I'll set you free in a year.
I was going for romantic.<eos> I know you're aware of most of my neuroses...<eos> Wiping down all the cutlery in restaurants and wearing a red tie on Tuesdays and listing all my neuroses in groups of three.<eos> But, um, there are some others that, uh, are rather more embarrassing, which, uh...<eos> Well, actually, I'm just gonna show you.
Hey!<eos> Hey, hey.<eos> Come on.<eos> We just came to say thank you.<eos> You already said thank you.
We know her.<eos> Why didn't you pay your respects to her?<eos> Where did you learn to greet only those you like?<eos> Where are your manners?<eos> I'll be watching you two.
Why didn't you pay your respects to her?<eos> Where did you learn to greet only those you like?<eos> Where are your manners?<eos> I'll be watching you two.<eos> If I see you ignoring Se Mi once more, I won't leave you alone.
Why are you here all alone?<eos> - I didn't want to upset your mother.<eos> - You're not, don't worry.<eos> I know you and my mom.<eos> I know you guys both... and you're a lot scarier.
I guess, you don't read Mills and Boon, and all that stuff.<eos> No way!<eos> I'm a feminist.<eos> Mills and Boon is feminist too.<eos> So, fillingtheminds of girls with rubbish like... some tall, dark, handsome guy will come andwhisk you away on a whitehorse... that is feminism to you?
No.<eos> Her.<eos> Touch her.<eos> Could you hit her?<eos> My uncle sent you?
Maybe they want pictures of an over-botoxed Nancy Dell'Olio?<eos> Right, the first chance you get just go and deal with Dan.<eos> Tear him a new bum or whatever it is people say.<eos> Right, right, right, right, right.<eos> I mean, what would possess you to walk about the streets with notes just... there for anybody to see?
Some of these are my mother's.<eos> But none of them belong to you, Sandy.<eos> All right, hold on!<eos> Just wait a minute!<eos> You're saying she stole all this stuff from you?
So are you ready to order?<eos> What kind of question is this?<eos> Did you see this horrible, horrible menu?<eos> We can't have nice conversation here.<eos> Tomorrow I take you to nice place, my treat.
Ready? - Yeah.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> I don't want anything to do with this.<eos> Besides I don't have any keys.<eos> So I can't help you.
I'm excited about tonight.<eos> Me, too.<eos> So, it seems there's this bag...<eos> Athletic injury in your sleep.<eos> Excuse me, do I come into your place of business and interrupt you when you're working?
Yeah, me too.<eos> He took you to the golf course.<eos> Doesn't change things.<eos> He still clearly likes you.<eos> Wait, so he took all of you to the golf course on your first date?
I'd like to go, but I don't know anyone. It would be nice to find a familiar face there.<eos> Don't worry. We'll go with you, right?<eos> - I don't know if I--<eos> - Yes, it's a fact.<eos> Perfect, I'll see you there.
They're kosher, right?<eos> Are they kosher?<eos> Look at me.<eos> Like looking in a mirror.<eos> Good, I'll call you with the address.
Does it come in my size?<eos> Don't forget what a great salesman I was, all right?<eos> I swept the 2002 Real Estate Awards.<eos> Suck on that, Doug Weston.<eos> Now, if you'll excuse me, I don't want to be late for my first meeting. Well, good, because I don't even want to be around you right now.
Adam, the final decision is yours.<eos> Some thoughts first?<eos> You're both great singers.<eos> I knew it from the get-go this was gonna be a challenge to figure out who I was gonna go with.<eos> [ Groans ] I put you together because you were so strong and you could handle...
' We got to fight this.<eos> Can I take off my lawyer hat for a minute?<eos> Yeah. 'I'm talking to you now as a friend.'<eos> You're going to need a much better lawyer.<eos> Cos the one you got - I don't know how the fuck he's going to get you out of this.
You don't know.<eos> You just guess.<eos> And you didn't tell your new best friend, Kirkland, either.<eos> I don't have any evidence.<eos> If I did, I'd put you in cuffs myself.
Be right there, Troy!<eos> All right, girls, this is a very important client.<eos> And unfortunately, he's not kid-friendly.<eos> Like you? Yes.<eos> So I'm just going to put you in the laundry room.
Lancelot?<eos> Snow.<eos> Oh!<eos> Oh!<eos> If I'd have known that you were the prisoners Mulan had brought back, I never would've locked you away.
Just trust me.<eos> I may have a way.<eos> Let us go.<eos> I'll allow it, but on one condition... take my bravest warrior with you.<eos> Allow Mulan to defend you.
I haven't seen you in at least a year.<eos> Maybe a little longer than that.<eos> Sorry, memory's fuzzy from the shock treatments.<eos> Good news, the sex addiction is gone.<eos> You and Celia are so cliquey, I never see you anymore.
That is what we call the wall of fame...<eos> People who started out with publishing deals, just like y'all, hoping for that famous singer to cut one of their songs. Come on.<eos> Let's keep going.<eos> Down the hall we've got the writers' rooms.<eos> We'll show you in a minute.
You have dominated the individual portion of this game, And as a result,you are guarantee aid spot at final tribal council.<eos> Two of you are going to go to the final with Kim.<eos> One of you will become the final member of the jury that will decide who wins this game.<eos> Huge decision tonight.<eos> Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. I'll see you at tribal council.
Five days to indict or the judge releases him.<eos> Yeah, and he'll go back on TV, he'll mock Jocelyn every night until she folds.<eos> - We gotta go now.<eos> - No, not you two.<eos> Jocelyn sees you as advocates.
Moves things along faster.<eos> Hey, come by the Williamsburg diner sometime.<eos> We work there.<eos> We'll give you free samples of food you shouldn't have to pay for anyway.<eos> So, what brings you in to this neighborhood?
Stop it!<eos> Snow, follow me!<eos> Where to?<eos> You tell me!<eos> Beg for the guests' forgiveness for you.
I can't do it!<eos> Oh, yes I can.<eos> You guys are going down.<eos> Right down into my belly.<eos> 'Cause I'm gonna eat you.
Oh, yeah?<eos> Well, how did you mean it, Annie?<eos> Look, I said that I thought you guys were going to be shallow at first.<eos> Before I moved here, I thought everybody in Beverly Hills was going to be shallow.<eos> But then I got to know you, and I obviously don't think that anymore.
You let Julia do whatever she wanted.<eos> We're debating 12th grade now?<eos> Like anything's changed.<eos> What do you want, Lisa?<eos> Do you want to hear I love you both the same?
Oh, don't get all up in my face, Finn.<eos> What were we supposed to do?<eos> Uh, quit Cheerios!<eos> Coach Sylvester is awful to you guys.<eos> And don't forget who was there for you the last time she dumped you on your ass- us, Glee Club.
You want it?<eos> Fuck you.<eos> We're going to live, Hilda.<eos> We're going to live.<eos> A few days ago, I was going to leave you all to sink or swim.
It's part of the bomb.<eos> Ladies, who's Augusto Gaez?<eos> Augusto Gaez is the arch nemesis of the CAT Squad and leader of the Gentle Hand.<eos> The bomb fragments trace to his factory in Rio.<eos> He tracked you down.
I don't wanna get involved.<eos> Where do you work now?<eos> - Where?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Company fired you a year ago, did you find a new job?
No, I'm not going anywhere.<eos> Get out of the car.<eos> It's not safe to talk in the car.<eos> It doesn't really feel safe out here, either.<eos> Look, I'm sorry if I scared you, but there's some things you guys need to know before you start answering questions.
We became friends because of her.<eos> But she's gone, and the four of you still seem very close.<eos> We weren't always.<eos> We lost touch when Ali went missing.<eos> What brought you back together?
Mary, please.<eos> I'm just trying to say that I think that my problem...<eos> - Alcoholism?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Stopped you from growing up.
Why's it so quiet?<eos> Where'd all these rats go?<eos> Min Goo!<eos> Min Goo, time to get to work!<eos> Rats, you just wait until I catch you.
I'm going with you.<eos> Me too.<eos> I can't be alone today.<eos> And a funeral is the only place I can cry in public where people won't ask me what's wrong.<eos> And afterwards, I'll take you to a browns game.
Now you're getting it.<eos> Look at us, doing good, getting to know our neighbors.<eos> That must be judgey face.<eos> Pam and Sally want in.<eos> Their husbands have been gawking at you too.
Find some place that feels like center.<eos> This challenge is back on.<eos> You're going to have to really concentrate now.<eos> Very little room for error here.<eos> The slightest shift in your balance will knock you off of this beam.
You know Candy, right?<eos> Hello, kids!<eos> You guys know each other, right? Say hello.<eos> You know her?<eos> Say hello so that more people will like you. It will help you in your career.
She's probably too disappointed.<eos> We were too nervous.<eos> Unnis!<eos> You guys were awesome!<eos> This is my first hearing something like that, I think I totally love you.
- When you don't know what to say.<eos> Um, so are you women from Ireland perchance?<eos> - No.<eos> - Really?<eos> I'm very surprised to hear that news because when I look at you, my wiener doubles in size.
Another picture before I go?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Ready?<eos> One, two, three ...<eos> Will I ever see you again?
And you'll call me tomorrow when Nicki arrives.<eos> If we win, everything in our lives will change.<eos> So I want to lay out the game plan.<eos> I'm calling a press conference after the results are in.<eos> I'm announcing who we are and introducing you as my wives on the steps of the Capitol.
I don't know who you are.<eos> And I realize there are institutions like all saints that put people like you on a poster and make you feel important, but you're not.<eos> Because it's people like me who make doctors like you worthwhile at all.<eos> There are parts of this hospital that wouldn't exist without my support.<eos> I built them up like that and I can tear you down just as easily, you silly little runt.
I really did.<eos> You did great, Kev.<eos> I think you guys should try thanking daddy.<eos> Okay?<eos> Adventures toughen you up.
Jesus, you think you're gonna shut up some time and let's watch in peace?<eos> I can't stand it.<eos> Come on. Can't you take a little joke?<eos> Yes, there is plenty of space.<eos> Go somewhere else if we're bothering you.
A ritual using rye flour.<eos> We use rye flour in many ceremonies.<eos> Yeah, and it has LSD fungus in it.<eos> That's what made you afraid of Zephyra.<eos> You thought that her obsession with the black arts could destroy you.
You can even save something for yourselves.<eos> We've got your passports.<eos> If you run away, we'll find you.<eos> Anyway, we know where you came from.<eos> I'll bring you here and pick you up every day.
Itineraries.<eos> Maximizes historical sites, minimizes...<eos> Fun?<eos> I was going to say "travel time. " They're just suggestions.<eos> And I promise I will catch up with you as soon as I can.
- Great.<eos> Of course, the only one who doesn't like this is britta.<eos> Do you ever get tired of being a buzz kill?<eos> This is gonna be exciting, ladies.<eos> I hereby deputize you As campus security for 48 hours.
I told you.<eos> You got this whole thing wrong, okay?<eos> I'm what you call a good guy here!<eos> I'm not guilty of anything except trying to save the world, all right?<eos> And I would tell you who from, but I don't think you'd believe me.
Nii-chan.<eos> Everything is finished now.<eos> Kohei.<eos> Your flight is soon right?<eos> I'll send you off.
Clear?<eos> Perhaps I should say something, but I have nothing to say to you.<eos> I have nothing to say to you, either.<eos> Let's get this over with.<eos> The last thing I did was to put you here.
It's pretty sensitive down there so it will probably hurt.<eos> Here we go.<eos> There are different kinds of needles, huh? - - Mm.<eos> How big is the biggest?<eos> I can show you later, if you wish?
What happened to him?<eos> He's dead.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I'm gonna be sick again.<eos> An officer's going to come by and take you both to the hospital, get you checked out.
let's get a doctor.<eos> no need.<eos> he's dead.<eos> but still... we have no money for doctors.<eos> you lost two sons and are considered a "house of honor." this exempts you from paying funeral fees.
That's not our concern.<eos> Closing the theatre means you won't pay us, right?<eos> Others work at the local spa when they're off duty.<eos> What?<eos> Shall I introduce you?
A drowning?<eos> No.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> I was a junior officer at the time.<eos> But I interviewed both of you.
So that's why it's hard to start dating, y'know?<eos> That's why it's...<eos> You still got it.<eos> Daddy, where are we going?<eos> I'm taking you to your mom's house.
Now, firstly, how's the new equipment?<eos> Good.<eos> Complex, but...<eos> Yes, I wasn't sure about weapons.<eos> I figured I'd let you order them, and then I'll reimburse you.
SorryI 'mlate.<eos> To Kinsey Of course you're sorry.<eos> Go tell her that we are here.<eos> Hi, we are ready to manicure at 16:00?<eos> Waiting on you.
Do you know where we will stay when we play against the Southern Glenn?<eos> My mom is interested.<eos> I put it on the list?<eos> Are you reading my mind.<eos> My new Deputy Assistant here, will seek this information and I'll will tell you tomorrow.
- What?<eos> On behalf of Thomas and myself, get the fuck out of our house.<eos> Marlene might have been a little rough around the edges, but you're downright cruel.<eos> You kill Marlene's fish, you send Thomas off to die.<eos> And maybe your mom didn't leave you the house to teach you a lesson, or maybe she just didn't like you.
"Go on in there, girls...<eos> Into the public restroom of an international airport."<eos> Just release my custody of them to whoever's in there.<eos> "Go ahead, good luck to you.<eos> Maybe I'll see you later."
You want to speak with them?<eos> Alright.<eos> We'll schedule a visit to the workers' quarters then.<eos> I appreciate it.<eos> See you at the post-inspection meeting.
- Life sentence. - Indeed.<eos> No less than life in prison.<eos> If I wanted to arrest you red handed, I could have.<eos> I would have followed you till the next mistake.<eos> I would have arrested you, sentenced... but then the women's rights old hags would have come out... and made heroes of you.
Oh, do you now, you diddly doo?<eos> I've gone Irish.<eos> I think you should leave.<eos> Not before I show you the bed that I want, and at a staff discount.<eos> Never let them push you round, girls, yeah?
- Cody. You are under arrest for being in violation of the federal Gun Control Act.<eos> Anything you say can and will be held against you in a court of law.<eos> You have the right to an attorney.<eos> Okay.<eos> Tawny, Tanya and Tammy, Lloyd will see you now.
Not you.<eos> What about accents?<eos> You like Aussies?<eos> You wanna wear my leather hat?<eos> Mascots, I'll be checking you in in 1 0 minutes at the mascot table.
- Please get us her autograph!<eos> - I'm going to faint!<eos> Who's that?<eos> What's all that screaming?<eos> - Darlings, I'll call you back.
[Door closes] Hey.<eos> What's up?<eos> . I know about you and Jenna, Dennis.<eos> Oh. I... I get why you're here.<eos> You want me to rank you.
Cerie: Also, Pete and Tracy's wives are in your office.<eos> Paula is Pete's wife and Angie is the black one and...<eos> Okay, Cerie, I got it.<eos> Dr. Liz, we need some advice from the dealbreaker lady.<eos> I don't know if that's a good idea. I know you, and I know your husbands...
How bad do you want it? You heard the woman. we're working nights.<eos> Um, I have a tiny scheduling conflict.<eos> I coach my daughter's basketball team on friday nights.So if I could-- friday nights are now work nights.<eos> If we're successful, those of you on commission stand to do very well.<eos> And those of you who aren't?
It was stupid. It was really stupid.<eos> She never meant to hurt him.<eos> Okay, you'll tell the police that, and it'll--it'll be okay.<eos> Everything will be okay.<eos> I'm s- - I'm so deeply s-sorry... for every time that I ever hurt you or disappointed you or let you down.
It's a pleasure meeting you, Mayor.<eos> It's a beautiful hotel.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> Welcome to Sikeston.<eos> If you'll permit me, I'll escort you over to the clinic... and we can, uh, get you all settled in to your new home. Thank you.
I have never seen such a sorry display in all my life.<eos> I mean, where's the fire?<eos> Where is the intensity?<eos> And for God's sake, where are the tight ends?<eos> Your team needs you out there.
Thanks. What's going on?<eos> A lot happened while you were gone.<eos> Congrats. RACETRACK:<eos> Thanks.<eos> Congratulations to both of you.
-Dribbling?<eos> -Scoring?<eos> -Passing.<eos> That's right, passing. Do you know why?<eos> Because it binds you together as a team, okay?
Jennyfer Schecter.<eos> We love you Jenny!<eos> We love you too, Jenny!<eos> Thank you.<eos> I wanna thank my incredible friends who I, I really love you, guys.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.<eos> You down, you're a good boy.<eos> - Doggy.<eos> - He's just doing his job.<eos> I'm really sorry if he scared you.
I - I mean, one where they actually light a fire underneath you.<eos> ? here's $20for the poker machines.<eos> that's all you get, okay?<eos> so have fun.<eos> see you in a while.
Let's get in the van.<eos> The boy's making progress every day.<eos> So is his sister.<eos> Welcome, children.<eos> Well, I was expecting you.
I've got it nice and cosy inside.<eos> Fantastic!<eos> It's minging.<eos> I used to sleep in here myself back when we had regular guests.<eos> Well, we'll swap you, then.
Good morning.<eos> Good morning.<eos> From Waterworks.<eos> Dear Madam,<eos> I was so embarrassed yesterday that I arranged to see you in the afternoon, but I'm working at that time.
Well, she also predicted the return of high-waisted jeans.<eos> I'm serious, like, way back in 2006.<eos> Kel, jump on board.<eos> It's gonna be fun.<eos> Madame Flanagan will see you now.
Your house.<eos> Along with Debbie's scarf.<eos> Probably planted... by some DI with a grudge on a corruption charge.<eos> What happened to you, Mac?<eos> Little girls younger than your own daughter, looking to you for protection.
My pills could never do something like that.<eos> Why should we believe you?<eos> Because that's the whole point, isn't it? When those girls find out that the pills are no good and that their only option is to have an abortion, then they might hear the name of a doctor.<eos> A doctor who doesn't ask too many questions.<eos> A doctor who doesn't leave you helpless with your legs cocked up in the air demanding an extra $50 to finish the job.
Peyton?<eos> - Yeah. - You okay?<eos> I love it.<eos> Thank you.<eos> And I just want you guys to know I love you so much.
Jacques de Parentis, please.<eos> - He isn't here anymore.<eos> - Yes, he is.<eos> Scream and you die.<eos> I said I'd deal with you.
Give me a second, I want to change my shirt.<eos> No, actually, that's pretty good.<eos> Salty. You girls want some of this?<eos> Check it out?<eos> Keeps you regular.
I think her nipples are hard.<eos> As a matter of fact, they are.<eos> My nipples are hard and my lady is wet.<eos> Because success turns me on.<eos> And if success doesn't turn you on then you can take your initial $5000 investment fees pop on out to your shit cars and drive out of here.
My nipples are hard and my lady is wet.<eos> Because success turns me on.<eos> And if success doesn't turn you on then you can take your initial $5000 investment fees pop on out to your shit cars and drive out of here.<eos> Okay then.<eos> So, what turns you on?
I washed.<eos> It's sugar.<eos> Your test results were improving too regularly and too quickly.<eos> I was concerned that you weren't taking your pills, that it was all an act.<eos> So I switched you to a placebo to see if your improvements would continue.
Means there's some meat on this bone.<eos> All right, we're rolling.<eos> My friends, we are outside the office of General Mark Chesler to discover the truth about America's secret prisons.<eos> What's going on here?<eos> Who the hell let you in this building?
What?<eos> Those aren't my daughters.<eos> We're supposed to be sisters!<eos> Girls, we can't help if you don't tell us what's wrong.<eos> Is it possible that there's something going on that may have put all three of you in bad moods?
Boss, come on!<eos> I wanna piss first.<eos> Let's go together.<eos> No, I can do it myself.<eos> I don't need you.
We're just... Guys.<eos> Very,very smart guys.<eos> - So you were totally scamming us?<eos> - Yes.<eos> And I wouldn't blame you if you Waed out of here and never wanted to see us again.
- Coags are stable.<eos> [Owen] Good. OR's ready.<eos> Let's take him up.<eos> Yang, you're with me.<eos> Torres, Adamson, call you when we're ready for the femur.
Good.<eos> All right.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Yes,all right.<eos> Let me help you here.
Feel the stretch.<eos> Bend at the waist and put your hands to the floor.<eos> If you can't get your hands all the way to the floor, it's cool.<eos> Don't stress it.<eos> When you're doing naked yoga, make sure your friends are all taking pictures of you, because, you know, that's just what you do if you're a Suicide Girl.
from Shinko-chan's class.<eos> Of course.<eos> I study algae at Yamaguchi U.<eos> She lives in the residence.<eos> I'll walk you home.
Yeah, Barb, that's right... You just walk out, just like you did on our marriage.<eos> I'd go after her but I don't want everyone looking at my butt.<eos> Today I thought you could take the Kiersey personality test.<eos> I think if we get a better understanding of your personality types, we can find out where this underlying depression might be coming from.<eos> I know you want me to compliment you.
I wrote the other day after listened to a piece of gianni morandi ,<eos> " one in a thousand make it ." I asked myself :<eos> " But the other assholes 999 , no one dedicates a song ? " .<eos> He did it checco .<eos> now clearly I can hear you in unplattes , but if you have imagination , I try to dream hereinafter
!<eos> I'm sorry, but what with the farewell...<eos> Never mind.<eos> This is Oscar.<eos> He's the guy from the agency who'll take you to the house.
Keep trying.<eos> Hello, Jamie.<eos> Oh, hi.<eos> Hello.<eos> Can I help you with something?
What if the fire department had not come in time?<eos> Then I would have lost you.<eos> My most precious Yang Yang<eos> I had mixed feeling when I knew what happened.<eos> I am worried that you girls would be scared, but I know that God, in His power, will show His grace and keep you safe.
How about coffee?<eos> I think someone saw us.<eos> No one saw us.<eos> There was definitely something out there.<eos> You guys are letting your guilt get to you.
But Cranford wishes to welcome her!<eos> Surely there will be an opportunity for cards?<eos> Lady Glenmire is accustomed to the best of company.<eos> She must not be misled, and believe that I am not.<eos> I shall not incommode you further.
We rang Miss Pole's door and the bell remained unanswered.<eos> Miss Matty?<eos> Oh!<eos> William.<eos> The bride and groom have despatched me to escort you to their home!
Oh, shit!<eos> Hallo.<eos> Mother?<eos> Mother, calm down.<eos> As well they followed you?
Can't you see I'm putting so much effort on the cleaning?<eos> So much dust. Need I clean them for you?<eos> Ooo.. So clean now.<eos> Why are there so many weeds here?<eos> If I didn't pull you out, what will you become?
He should of known Ty'd never let him just stop the monthly.<eos> Monthly?<eos> Durst?<eos> Everyone in town's gotta pay the kindly sheriff.<eos> Try saying no, and he'll set you up on some trumped-up charge.
- What's your name?<eos> - Jin.<eos> - And you?<eos> - Bin.<eos> This is the first time I've seen you around.
After saying you were a swindler, everyone was happy to give the notes back.<eos> I'll convert your promissory note into cash.<eos> Going round 10 different companies was tiring.<eos> You little brat!<eos> I managed to get about 200 million ($1,900,000) off you, but I'm sure you expected more.
None of them could be trusted.<eos> Sooner or later, they all would've betrayed me.<eos> Just like Mai and Ty Lee did.<eos> Azula, we are concerned for you and your well-being.<eos> My father asked you to come here and talk to me, didn't he?
No, it's been years.<eos> Between those poaching bastards at NASA and the yuppies and NIMBY...<eos> I'm pretty much boxed in here-- ceased, desisted and enjoined to death.<eos> What's the big deal? I'm just trying to run a little launch facility.<eos> Come on, I'll show you.
According to his receipts, only one person bought a Hopi Indian revenge mask in the last 50 years.<eos> I...<eos> I...<eos> It was all their fault!<eos> They put up the slam page and framed you.
"I could really enjoy getting fucked in here.<eos> "I can scream and holler and break shit, "yell instructions. "I will never fuck in nobody's mama's house again."<eos> And you never did.<eos> You never fucking did.<eos> Ladies, remember the first time you ever had a man take you on vacation?
And when I was 5 years old, and my sister was 3, My mom died, and my father was freed from her hold on him<eos> So he came to get us. To claim what was his.<eos> He started making us use our powers to get what he wanted out of people.<eos> We made them do such terrible things.<eos> And if we tried not to he would-- tie you up.
You will remain captive in my negativity if you lay a hand on either one of them.<eos> I warned you not to screw me over.<eos> How could you?<eos> I'll be back very, very soon.<eos> And I promise you that that man is not gonna hurt you.
I used to dream that Tony would be spontaneous like this.<eos> Okay, I'm in.<eos> And I'm also... spontaneous.<eos> I wish I hadn't done that.<eos> Kids, morals usually come at the end of stories, but this one is so important, I'm gonna tell you now:
For God's sake.<eos> Just because you're a bunch of rich brats doesn't mean you can't have angst.<eos> Channel it.<eos> This is a song about your mother.<eos> She's been lying to you about sex, and it pisses you off.
OK.<eos> See you in a bit.<eos> Bye.<eos> Two milks, please.<eos> You don't mind if I join you, do you?
She figured she could solve everybody's problems.<eos> Elizabeth,I'm coming in.<eos> - Just to talk to you,okay?<eos> - No!<eos> So Dr. Lori Winton introduced you and Elizabeth to Nicole.
Senior, please don't do that.<eos> We won't do that again.<eos> You have all fallen victim to temptations.<eos> Maybe you will go look at snakes and tigers tonight.<eos> No way, I have to lock you all up.
Looks Like We're Gonna Have To Wrap Things Up.<eos> You Don't Have To Go Home, But You Can't Quilt Here.<eos> Will We See You Tomorrow?<eos> I Don't Think So.<eos> I Mean,This Was Fun, But Maybe I'll Just See You At The Cemetery.
- This more of your shit, huh?<eos> - Jesus Christ. - It's all right, Mom.<eos> Get in.<eos> Now. Please.<eos> I'm not gonna hurt you.
I mean, you're nice and I think she really likes you.<eos> So, I bet the last thing you want to do right now, is have polite dinner conversation with some old guy you just met.<eos> How about we start fresh?<eos> Take a rain check?<eos> I'll take the two of you out to some fabulous dinner at a great restaurant.
That's not what I was hoping they'd say.<eos> What?<eos> We have to leave Miami?<eos> You don't have a choice.<eos> The whole cartel is after you now.
Not bad work.<eos> And here's yours,as promised.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Here you guys are.<eos> I looked all over the dining hall for you.
Irreplaceable.<eos> Ok, thank you.<eos> Hello.<eos> Well, we were just going to do our secret santa thing.<eos> Ok, well, I could meet you later.
I'll be back soon.<eos> It's gone too far.<eos> Listen to us. It's getting dangerous.<eos> Take him to hospital.<eos> He's manipulating you.
Uh, the library.<eos> Curfew's in 5 minutes.<eos> that's why we're here.<eos> I don't want anyone Drinking on the hall.<eos> If you do, I'll write you up.
Look at you.<eos> Roger Sterling.<eos> Eleanor.<eos> Eleanor Ames.<eos> What a great God that made two of you.
What do they need ?<eos> They need the appearance of a win.<eos> Give it to them.<eos> The scapegoat for what ?<eos> Come in, I've been waiting for you.
She's happy now.<eos> She's at peace.<eos> There's some things she wanted us to tell you.<eos> Go from your heart.<eos> Sydney loved you.
- Thank you.<eos> I'll stay behind and work victimology.<eos> Great.<eos> I could use some extra hands.<eos> We'll call you if we find anything.
I think we just keep coming back out of habit... you know?<eos> I don't want to feel like we lead each other on.<eos> I mean, you deserve so much more than that and I just keep screwing these things up.<eos> See you tomorrow, boss.<eos> You managed to bring the monastery with you.
It will be all change for us!<eos> You are the architect of our community's destruction!<eos> You have betrayed your daughter, your neighbours and your town, and you've wilfully kept your machinations secret!<eos> I did not mean to deceive you.<eos> I am sorry if I have offended you.
Isn't there?<eos> You know something.<eos> Did you find out?<eos> She will not open up.<eos> His majesty calls all of you inside.
Give me two bucks.<eos> Yes.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> You're the best!<eos> I love you too.
Your Highness, the painting has to be done at the Bureau because it takes many days to complete.<eos> - We need pigments and brushes and... - Impudent wench!<eos> How dare you disagree with Her Highness?<eos> Forgive me, Your Highness!<eos> Then I will expect you in my chambers everyday.
I really do feel awful about this.<eos> But the royal proclamation declared...<eos> Yes, but it would appear that more than one girl actually fits the slipper.<eos> I'm very sorry to have inconvenienced you.<eos> Why don't I have the Grand Duke escort you home safely.
Even with every kid getting a present.<eos> Willie and Charlene found out that kindred spirits and soul mates often come in all shapes and sizes.<eos> And Bob and Linda finally got e-mail.<eos> Linda, where are all the new orders?<eos> I e-mailed you five minutes ago!
He worked non-stop.<eos> Funding, research, treatment. He was present on every front.<eos> The battlefield reminded him of a blighted city, Sodom, where the righteous no longer existed.<eos> In Djibouti, HIV-positive hookers get done in.<eos> Here, you have the police to protect you.
You think your dad will buy us dinner?<eos> Want to buy Uncle John dinner?<eos> You don't want to come?<eos> No, I think I'm just going to stay here and... take a little cat nap.<eos> You're bigger than the last time I saw you.
Charming.<eos> One m.<eos> That's interesting, but we're in a hurry.<eos> Sorry for my nonsense.<eos> How may I help you?
Oh, it's probably just late.<eos> I mean, my mama, she wouldn't let him forget.<eos> You know what I think?<eos> I just took care of you two for two weeks for nothin'!<eos> I think your Mama and Daddy left you here for good.
Aw, that's messed up, man.<eos> Man, don't you have to wear a tutu or ballerina outfit or something?<eos> - What's that on your head?<eos> - Quit playin'.<eos> - Dad didn't say to take all of you.
You think I want him to get away with it?<eos> You've always been there for us, Ethan.<eos> Don't abandon us now.<eos> That's what you think?<eos> That I've abandoned you?
Brielle, get in here.<eos> It's so much fun.<eos> Do you think you can handle this?<eos> I've already did.<eos> I'm gonna get you!
I smelt it!<eos> I smelt it!<eos> I smelt it, God!<eos> It's a miracle!<eos> I smell you, flowers.
But I'm not going for me and I'm not going for the agency,<eos> I'm going for you.<eos> Hey, whatever gets you through the night.<eos> I can't believe you guys ordered in from Locanda Veneta.<eos> Well, if we weren't stuck here all night, we'd probably take you to one of L.A's finest restaurants.
These are my Mom and Dad. Mom, Dad...<eos> Mom, Dad meet my Rasha.<eos> Check these invoices again.<eos> Is something wrong?<eos> - I asked you to check them, didn't I?
There was no alphas and omegas and betas running around anywhere.<eos> Coyote: Being able to get away, just let everything hang.<eos> Anything I can bring up or want to talk about, it didn't matter what was on my mind, these were people I could trust.<eos> I could just let my hair down and not have to worry about things. H:<eos> He wouldn't tell you.
He died of leukemia.<eos> How do you feel now?<eos> You got any strawberry milk in there?<eos> No, but she'll make 0.5 past light speed.<eos> If you want, I'll show you around, since no one's trying to stop the ship or blast us.
Will do.<eos> JOE: I need you girls ready in five minutes.<eos> Mommy's got a dentist appointment.<eos> I got sticky hands. I know.<eos> So I'm taking you to school today.
20$.<eos> Hey, ladies.<eos> I see you're ready to pay the proper fine for the nine.<eos> You can cop a feel if you'd like.<eos> Just don't let management see you.
Casting yourself as a man of the people, the son of a farmer.<eos> A revolutionary.<eos> Please.<eos> It may come as some surprise to you, Madame President, but I wish to strike a chord with the common man.<eos> Hand over those pages or I'll have these guards search you.
Are you all right?<eos> - No problem, Flash.<eos> - We got ourselves a deal, then.<eos> Excellent.<eos> If that's permanent... I'll see you in court.
It's a good thing I brought extra rope.<eos> Untie me, you freak!<eos> Figures you'd be good with your mouth.<eos> Hey.<eos> No one is gonna hear you.
You okay?<eos> I had to shoot him.<eos> He would've killed you.<eos> I would've done the same thing.<eos> I don't know what to say, I put you through hell.
Qe got what it takes to win this fight<eos> Jets, you stiff, you dull, you old Your moves and motions leave us cold<eos> Carson, captain of their team A loser even in her dreams<eos> You said it all, except one hitch She's a stuck-up, nasty, stupid little witch<eos> You girls think that you're ahead Our mascot's moves will knock you dead!

If you want to borrow my phone, the answer's no.<eos> I'm here to say thank you and apologize...<eos> - Threatening to kill me?<eos> - I did not threaten to kill you.<eos> I just said I'd get you.
But listen to me.<eos> This is a very important dinner.<eos> It's very important to your father.<eos> It's important for his career.<eos> His career pays for all those nice things that you always ask for that you like for him to buy for you.

Loser.<eos> Loser.<eos> Let's review.<eos> Winner, winner, loser, loser.<eos> Now I'd appreciate it if you'd leave my conference room before anyone sees you and confuses you with someone I'd actually hire.
Does he prefer it here?<eos> It must be done correctly?<eos> That is vital.<eos> Are you scared?<eos> Does he worry you sometimes?

Uh, my name's Georgette.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Nice to meet you.<eos> And, uh, lovely.<eos> And I'm just gonna leave you two to, uh- to, uh- to catch up on everything.
As it is my fault for not disciplining the girls properly, I... I will accept punishment on their behalf.<eos> You are right.<eos> You and the Palace Mistress are both expelled.<eos> My Lord!<eos> If something like this happens again, I will expel both of you from your posts.
My Lord!<eos> If something like this happens again, I will expel both of you from your posts.<eos> I will keep this incident quiet this time.<eos> Discipline your girls well.<eos> If not, I will not only expel you two from the Courtesan Register, but I will send you to a distant place and make you pay for your crime.
~AndIwilldieyoung<eos> Cor, what's this, then?<eos> PECCARY: Emilio Estevez?<eos> So that's where you've been.<eos> Girls, I've been neglecting you, but I want to make up for it.
" But obedience dictates my acts and faith lights my way. "<eos> Do not come out under any circumstances.<eos> The children would be killed.<eos> I will send a sister to come for you when the time is right.<eos> Wait for her, she'll bring you back.
- If the sun isn't up, why should we be?<eos> Dads.<eos> Remember, where I'm headed is so remote, there's no cell service.<eos> Ach, why even live?<eos> My point is, I can't be checking up on you, so I need you guys to promise me that everything is gonna go OK.
Love you, Thick Madame!<eos> They are here to work it.<eos> This is the fashion line for the uptown hot mama.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, this ain't no "Lame" Bryant.<eos> Fashion that will blow you away.
Can I at least take you home, to avoid you being attacked again?<eos> By the way, that fool was right about one thing.<eos> What are two good women like you doing here at this time of night?<eos> The streets ofJerusalem would be safe... if it weren't for those foreigners who attacked us.<eos> And foreigners like us who rescued you.
Git.<eos> What are you doin', sitting back there?<eos> Oh, please let me stay.<eos> When I'm back tonight you better all be sweet for me to fuck.<eos> Or have your damn bags packed, 'cause I'll throw every one of you out.
I'm really sorry.<eos> But when I was living on the streets,<eos> I had a lot of time to just sit and think to myself and clear my head, and...<eos> I've grown up, you know? I...<eos> I don't want you to worry, I'm not gonna be bothering you anymore.
Do you have an appointment ?<eos> No, but I am her biggest fan and I would love to be her co-anchor.<eos> Okay, have a seat and a psychiatrist will be right with you.<eos> Oh please Miss, couldn't you just let us in for two minutes ?<eos> I got a better idea. How about if I let you in for no minutes ?
You cannot trust anyone- anyone- outside this room.<eos> You will get someone killed.<eos> Sleeping on guard, drunk on guard, consorting with the enemy.<eos> You run your mouths off on the street, you're no better than that.<eos> And I find out that you're doing it, I will ruin you.
- We'll split it.<eos> - Of course.<eos> We'll split it. No.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> I invited you.
You, too.<eos> Sit down.<eos> We do not appreciate being talked to like this.<eos> Shut up!<eos> Now I brought you here to sell some Evonne, and by damn it, I'm going to sell some Evonne.
Well?<eos> "Z".<eos> I told you.<eos> Are you... the future you and Leo, yeah.<eos> - And we've been expecting you.
It blows your mind, doesn't it?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Hold on, I don't understand how you know all this stuff.<eos> How did you know we would come? Because 15 years ago we were sitting there, where you're sitting, talking to our future selves.<eos> That's why we were expecting you.
How did you know we would come? Because 15 years ago we were sitting there, where you're sitting, talking to our future selves.<eos> That's why we were expecting you.<eos> Are you sure you don't want some cookies?<eos> No, I think I'd rather have aspirin.<eos> Like she said... we were expecting you.
You speak Mandarin?<eos> I can count to ten, ask to go to the bathroom and...<eos> I'm not pregnant.<eos> We haven't even done it yet!<eos> Okay, I'm going to leave you two alone now.
Wait, I'm confused.<eos> You left and then you came back?<eos> Yeah. I forgot my sunglasses.<eos> 200 bucks.<eos> This officer will take you downtown to take your statement, okay?
What's it about?<eos> Is it really true that Joakim was nice to you when you were alone?<eos> What is this?<eos> He taught us about horses.<eos> Did he ever touch you in a way that didn't feel OK?
Hello. Who's that on the phone?<eos> Temptation!<eos> How does he always get my number?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Anyway, I got big news, and I'll tell you over dinner.
We have to be ready.<eos> There's only one way to find out.<eos> Ask the Dancing Cat.<eos> Even as I said it, it sounded silly.<eos> Se√±or Luc - he sent me here to assist you.
Everyone tries out their material there.<eos> - We could see who our competition is.<eos> - For reals.<eos> - Tomorrow is Open Mike.<eos> I'll sign you up.
Because I told Hannah I'd meet her early, so we can go over our history presentation.<eos> And you're telling us this now?<eos> I forgot.<eos> I'm sorry, but this thing counts for, like, a third of my grade.<eos> Well, get your sisters ready, I'll drop you off on the way to work.
Why haven't they repaired it?<eos> Mikal?<eos> Stop it.<eos> You jerk!<eos> I'll get you for that!
Well, you do know that George W Bush is the honorary chairman.<eos> This whole week they didn't play us.<eos> - This whole week they didn't play us.<eos> - That's one song.<eos> - No one boycotted you.
How do you know this?<eos> - Hey, I just run a saloon.<eos> But hunters have been known to pass through now and again. Including your dad a long time ago.<eos> John was like family once. Oh, yeah?<eos> How come he's never mentioned you before?
- Do you feel like champions?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Well, you are champions.<eos> And you're always gonna be champions.<eos> No matter who's coaching you.
All right, girls, hit the showers.<eos> - How you doing, Julie? - Oh, I'm good.<eos> You're looking great out there.<eos> You're getting a lot more range on your shots. / Thanks.<eos> Coach Hayden, what do you mean, "no matter who's coaching you"?
Now, get that detective on the phone.<eos> Talk things out with Orson.<eos> I can't. It's bad luck for the groom to see the bride before the wedding.<eos> You know what's really bad luck? Marrying a wife-killer.<eos> If the three of you don't drop this right now, I will never forgive you.
Why are you crying?<eos> Don't be afraid.<eos> I'm here to help you.<eos> All of you.<eos> That 's why Mr. Tadeu brought you here.
Just one more thing:<eos> Don't get any ideas, say, like trying to run away.<eos> No one's ever escaped.<eos> We're in the jungle.<eos> If you wander out, wild beasts... snakes, gators, panthers, will eat you up.
I'll show you a way out.<eos> Listen...<eos> See the clothesline?<eos> Grab a couple of those shirts to keep bugs off.<eos> Follow the river banks... and stop for nothing 'cause Saraiva will track you down.
Come on!<eos> Anybody home?<eos> You can stay here tonight.<eos> You're safe.<eos> After sunrise, I'll take you to a road nearby.
And I'm gonna find out who it was, oh, yeah.<eos> I'm gonna find out.<eos> Who was it?<eos> Huh?<eos> Who helped you?
I'm gonna find out.<eos> Who was it?<eos> Huh?<eos> Who helped you?<eos> Who helped you, dammit?
Just like those women in Ohio who were attacked had the right to feel safe in their homes.<eos> So does that justify taking the law into your own hands?<eos> What makes you say that I have?<eos> Because you're here confessing your sins.<eos> I know I don't have any evidence, and you know how quickly I'd arrest you if I did.
I needed another pair of hands.<eos> I lost an excellent esophageal jejunostomy because I had to clean up her mess.<eos> Plenty to go around here.<eos> Mobilize the left triangular ligament for me, will you?<eos> He's still in surgery, but I can bring you upstairs.
I jumped in the shower, and when I came out, she was gone.<eos> Mrs. Worth, why were you arguing with Jessica Lawson on the telephone on Monday?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Okay.<eos> Our phone records say that she called you, and we have a witness that overheard the argument.
Okay, guys, eyes on the prize.<eos> What do we do on our first date?<eos> Compliment them. Flirt.<eos> Pick your moment to make a move.<eos> Every woman knows a man doesn't touch you unless he means siness.
Hi there, Gudmundur.<eos> There we go.<eos> - Don't forget your bags.<eos> - Let's get to the car.<eos> Mommy loves you.

I need to talk to you about something.<eos> - Endorphins?<eos> - As a matter of fact.<eos> Heard you can get them from running, which is what I got to do.<eos> Girls, Daddy's going to be driving you this morning.
I just fired her.<eos> Goodbye, Charlie.<eos> Oh, come on, Lydia, don't go. I'll do anything.<eos> You know what?<eos> I don't need either one of you.
-Also she.<eos> -What can we do?<eos> -Do we have to leave town?<eos> We're really gonna help them,Missy.<eos> Yes,and you're right.Those people are never going to let you alone.
I'm sorry.<eos> I'd better get her home.<eos> Do you need anything else?<eos> I have your names.<eos> If we need you, we'll contact you.
We can't explain everything.<eos> You just need to know this is our only choice.<eos> For them.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Are you saying I'm never gonna see you again?
We're at 14.<eos> - Count them with me. 15!<eos> - 15. - 16, 17... - 16, 17...<eos> - 18, 19, 20... Why, Joanie Stubbs and Miss Lila.<eos> What brings you to the air this fine spring morning?
Thanks.<eos> Thanks for understanding.<eos> Ok, I will call you tonight, and we'll figure out a time later in the week.<eos> Tell you what, since it's my schedule that seems to be the problem ..<eos> why don't I just figure out a time and call you?
A total of seven. Seven decks.<eos> We've arranged these for you.<eos> You need something to do?<eos> The other two rooms are right next door.<eos> I'll show you in a moment.
I have a right to defend myself as a woman! - No means no!<eos> - What the hell is wrong with you?<eos> I'm sorry. I just came from that orientation seminar about college dating.<eos> Hi, I'm Kelly McGillis, and I'm here to talk to you about rape.<eos> Ladies, look to your left. Now look to your right. Statistics indicate that both of those men will rape you.
Good job.<eos> I'm gonna go hit up the ladies in the self-defence class.<eos> Ladies.<eos> My new target audience.<eos> I can't wait to see you all next time.
As a rule, we don't take on small accounts like this, except under extraordinary circumstances.<eos> Until the news reached my desk, no one was sure of what to do.<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> I can write you a check today.<eos> Figured that would please you.
So, uh... here's my pager number on this card.<eos> Right here, okay?<eos> We'll meet right back here, okay?<eos> You have to come back.<eos> But you can't tell anybody that I helped you outside of the hospital, or I might lose my job.
Bobbie really seemed like she didn't want a party.<eos> I think when she sees the portable karaoke machine, she will.<eos> Welcome to Caligula...<eos> Okay, look, I know this looks bad.<eos> But in all fairness to me I was lying because I didn't want you here.
- Yo, Carmen, our slices are up.<eos> - Well, Luis was 25.<eos> He ever mess with you?<eos> Luis wasn't even hardly in the mix no more. He only came around for the fringe benefits.<eos> Meaning he raped you too.
Hurricane Katrina.<eos> We held onto the roof.<eos> The man came in a boat.<eos> He saved our lives. He said he was our new daddy.<eos> Then he brought you to New York.
Then he brought you to New York.<eos> He said he'd take care of us. That we were his girls now.<eos> - Where are you staying?<eos> We never went outside before today.<eos> Has he ever hurt you? No.
She made the whole thing up.<eos> Rhea Reynolds is not a victim of The Carver.<eos> She's in the bedroom.<eos> Watch your step.<eos> I'd introduce you two, but I believe you've already met.
She's in shock.<eos> I'd like to take a couple of these girls back to the office for surgery.<eos> It'll be a late night, but maybe we can do them back to back.<eos> Ok.<eos> Chelsey, can you tell me anything you remember about the man who attacked you?
The direction of the design.<eos> You're saying this thing actually flew?<eos> At least 50 miles.<eos> At heights varying from several hundred feet to a few thousand.<eos> This photo what Gosnell gave you, or did you actually see it fly?
Let's not overreact, here.<eos> I'm not saying break up, I'm saying take some time apart.<eos> Until you get out of this hole you've dug for yourself.<eos> - Hey, sweetie.<eos> - Hey. I have good news. I wanted to tell you in person.
Wait a minute.<eos> I can't hear you.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I appreciate that.<eos> Don't let the yellow smoke get on you.
Laura left the park, but I shouldn't have told you that.<eos> Were you with her?<eos> Will she be punished?<eos> Are they also going to punish me?<eos> - Did anybody see you?
My God.<eos> Well, don't act like you don't know us.<eos> Karen, Lisa, Tori.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I haven't seen you in forever.
Megan, Heather.<eos> Come on now, girls.<eos> Is this any way to speak to your guests?<eos> Brittany and Tiffany Wilson.<eos> I haven't seen you since you were smaller.
My father even had to loan her father money... just so that they could keep their house.<eos> They just paid us back.<eos> - You guys, I love you guys.<eos> - We love you, too.<eos> I love you so much!
They just got here, but they don't know anyone.<eos> Maybe you know of an apartment... a job or something.<eos> Don't you worry. I'll make a couple calls and we'll--<eos> Yes, sure...<eos> He'll help you.
Sometimes I need to work up a sweat.<eos> Sitting at the desk all day makes my muscles and bones ache.<eos> Sitting at the desk all day makes my muscles and bones ache.<eos> Our bones are aching too.<eos> I'll show you a workout that will really pump you up.
Uh, can you tell me that one later?<eos> Mrs Kliner in the flat upstairs heard a noise, called the police.<eos> Kelly and I were at a lecture.<eos> Lucky you weren't here.<eos> Would have been terrifying to be in the house alone without a man, you know, friend, here to protect you.
And they want to force us to ask for a continuance... because they know Judge Simmons won't give them any.<eos> We won't be asking for one.<eos> Uh, Miss Heep, Miss Wilson?<eos> We have a trial next week.<eos> Lori will fill you in.
- Okay.<eos> All right, I've had enough.<eos> Your friend is dead.<eos> This is a murder case.<eos> If you're not willing to help us, we will split you up and treat you as suspects.
- You know, I'd really like to, but I can't.<eos> - Over here?<eos> Wow, it's just as creepy in here as it is out there.<eos> Actually, creepier.<eos> Welcome to San Francisco Memorial, how can I help, help, help you?
- Really? What was new 20 minutes ago?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> What did you talk about with your grandfather?<eos> Well-<eos> I mean, just because he gets you first in the evening... doesn't mean you get to waste all the good stories on him.
- No.<eos> You've already discussed everything there is to discuss.<eos> - You're all talked out.<eos> - We're not all talked out, Mom.<eos> He gets you first, talks you out, and I get two exhausted, empty shells.
She's down?<eos> Whether she plays for our team.<eos> The gay team.<eos> Wait... don't the bisexuals have their own team?<eos> Allright. I'm gonna help you, even though you're extremely annoying.
Hi, sorry, forgot my purse.<eos> Sorry to interrupt, Mr. Deline.<eos> Mia.<eos> Hi.<eos> I know you have some mentoring to do... so I'm gonna leave you two alone.
I mean, nothing you could tell us could top this.<eos> We met Grady Bridges.<eos> Star of The Valley, the best show ever.<eos> Anyway, he invited us to his birthday party tomorrow night.<eos> The star of a hit TV show invited you to his cool Hollywood birthday party?
- Earth to Brooke.<eos> He's you in pants.<eos> He is not.<eos> - He kinda is.<eos> - I hate you both!
Which means woman with luminous, shining... sparkling eyes.<eos> That is the cheesiest thing I have ever heard in my life.<eos> Ick.<eos> I know.<eos> I can't even look at you all, I'm so embarrassed.
Steady, steady...<eos> Here's your precious articles.<eos> Thanks, Marge, I can't wait to read about...<eos> "Sport Fishing with Sonny Jurgensen."<eos> What man would want you now?
Last week on Pll, our billionaire bachelor gave five lovely ladies a rose of continuation.<eos> And he hurled a rock of rejection at anyone displaying intelligence, character, or ethnicity.<eos> (GRUNTS) Tonight, we reveal a shocking secret.<eos> Ladies, when you were selected, you were told that you'd be dating a billionaire on his private island.<eos> Well, I'm afraid we misled you.
Madeline Evans.<eos> Brianna Withridge.<eos> Countess Marguerite Isabelle Thoreaux.<eos> You have been found guilty of committing the darkest art... Witchcraft.<eos> For this affront against God, I hereby condemn you to burn in the fires of hell.
Welcome to the 21st century.<eos> How did we come to be here?<eos> The last spell I cast before Wilkins condemned me to the Pyre. My blood entwined with a symbol in the book which called to my heir.<eos> And when she touched it, I gained possession of her body.<eos> And brought you back.
It was two nights ago.<eos> Was she with anyone?<eos> A man joined her in the lobby.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Yeah, I'll get them to you as soon as I can.
As I've stated time and time again, Pauly Shore is a lowbrow buffoon.<eos> - [ Inmate ] Look at that shit, man.<eos> - This is Quinn Connor... from Dickinson, North Dakota, and I wanna send this out to Pauly.<eos> I hope some dumb-ass convict makes you his bitch, Pauly!<eos> - [ Switching Channels ] - So Pauly gave each one of you... - a sexually transmitted disease?
- I'll explain later.<eos> - Nothing to explain.<eos> Find other seats, that's all.<eos> - I'll find you other seats.<eos> I'll buy you a drink to make it up to you.
Bye.<eos> That was Charlotte.<eos> She said, um...<eos> she has some news.<eos> She'll fax you at the office.
Be careful.<eos> Mr. McCann, those are bags that weigh 50 pounds a piece.<eos> Take the other end.<eos> Here we go.<eos> If you two old ladies want to get in, I'll take you home now.
I can go away or send via your parents.<eos> Continue to skip school and here is a house that looks like a pigsty!<eos> Where to go, come here, go back!<eos> Go to school, you have idea how is done?<eos> There are girls who beat you and that you steal everything you have!
-Who are you in all this?<eos> -I'm the mirror.<eos> -You are the mirror.<eos> If I'm the mirror and she's the image then who are you?<eos> I can see both of you so I'm God.
Potential slayers can function without sleep.<eos> I'm no good without my usual 90 minutes.<eos> I'm with him.<eos> Keep the chatter down.<eos> Or speak up so I can hear you.
Mr Foyle, I think you should be very careful what you're saying.<eos> If you're implying that my wife... No, no.<eos> Not at all.<eos> As a matter of fact, I have absolutely no evidence whatsoever that you did slip out of the Lewes's house and made the signal to the submarine.<eos> If I did, I'd have to arrest you.
Lorelai Gilmore, you sure grew up good.<eos> Oh, did I, Digger?<eos> Thanks.<eos> Listen, why didn't you return my calls?<eos> - 'Cause I hadn't seen you yet.
Then we will politely ask him to get in touch with us.<eos> Yes.<eos> - Coming?<eos> - No, you guys go ahead.<eos> I'll be in the back of the line so that when the earth opens up and swallows you whole, I'll be here to tell a story.
I'll tell Rory you had to go.<eos> All right. And tell her I'll call her later, and give her this.<eos> That's very nice. Now how about my finder's fee?<eos> You're very amusing.<eos> Thank you for a lovely evening, and I'll see the two of you on Friday.
Or a lack thereof.<eos> You still want to take a look at those L.E.S.'s?<eos> I don't know. You figured out how Kidwell died yet?<eos> I'll, um...<eos> I'll just getthem in order for you.
I was thinking maybe we could go together.<eos> I would love to.<eos> You know I would.<eos> But don't you think that would violate our little Geneva Convention of dating we have?<eos> Because I told Summer I'd meet you both there.
It's over.<eos> Wolf, I want to say thanks.<eos> You taught me a valuable lesson.<eos> The truth? It's not overrated.<eos> I am going to get you, Shepherd!
It's my own fault.<eos> What gets me so cockeyed sore at myself... is that I fell for that big hunk of beef.<eos> So you finally got wise to yourself, did you?<eos> The funny thing about you women is most of you don't get wise soon enough.<eos> You wait until you're so old, nobody wants you.
Raj, it's really not important but suppose... just now when we were crossing the road... you could only save one of us from being run over by that truck... whom would you have saved, Pooja or me?<eos> - What sort of a question is that Tina?<eos> one of them is my love and the other is my friend<eos> Of the three of us if I could save only two...<eos> I would've saved the two of you and I'd let myself be run over by the truck
- You know what?<eos> .<eos> I'll get some flyers printed up.<eos> I know a few guys in L.A.<eos> I'll try to put a band together, and I'll see you at the hotel.
Now, listen, you forget about him, and you go and have some fun -- fun, fun, fun.<eos> - - Fat-ass dog girl! -<eos> - Whoo!<eos> Mother's ass!<eos> Why do you let them treat you like this? !
You can do this tonight, I know you can.<eos> And this is it.<eos> We retire.<eos> Hey, hey, girls.<eos> I'll see you...
And why?<eos> . For them?<eos> .<eos> The ones who hated you....<eos> Have forsaken you?
- I still smell the blood of an Irishwoman.<eos> Take the bag.<eos> Take the money.<eos> Go to Heaven.<eos> Marina will look after you.
Good afternoon, ladies.<eos> Could you spare a few pence for the poor black babies of Africa?<eos> - Here you are.<eos> - It's a very good cause.<eos> Thanks, God bless you.
- And what do they invariably answer?<eos> - Sense of humor.<eos> - Sense of humor.<eos> - Sense of humor is huge. Defiinitely.<eos> And yet, if two lean, mean, play-by-their-own-rules... motorcycle-riding men strolled up to this booth... and beat the shit out of us two humorous guys, right... and asked you out for a ride, you would be weak at the knees.
Don't you ever think about sin or guilt?<eos> That was a stupid thing to say, wasn't it?<eos> Guilt?<eos> Really, why do you do it?<eos> When I see you on the streets...
Damn right it will, Travis.<eos> How many terraformers her family own, anyway?<eos> All of them.<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> I'll catch up with you in a minute.
Thank you.<eos> YORK KINGDOM OF NORTHUMBRIA<eos> Forgive me, Lord.<eos> Please, Lord.<eos> May the gods protect you on your quest.
They believe you to be the King, Lord.<eos> Then let him be the King.<eos> King for the day.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you and may God bless you all.
The other lives in a cave and talks to sheep.<eos> They each think the other has it better.<eos> I regret to inform you, the Baudelaires' fate was worse.<eos> Chop-chop, Baudelaires!<eos> Now that I've found you a suitable guardian, I'm going to take you to your new home before banking hours begin.
- We need your help.<eos> - We want to fight.<eos> - Just as Van Damn would.<eos> We want you to run for office.<eos> Did Jela put you up to this?
She's fighting with her cluster.<eos> Be careful.<eos> Can I ask you about one of the BPO hunters?<eos> Do you know him?<eos> If he's the one that's after you, I must say, I underestimated either your recklessness or your courage.
- We need your help.<eos> - We want to fight.<eos> - Just as Van Damn would.<eos> We want you to run for office.<eos> Did Jela put you up to this?
Don't scare my wife!<eos> It's okay.<eos> Soldiers need a break too.<eos> Take your pants off and hop in the water.<eos> No one's going to see you here.
- Hey, listen, man.<eos> I got hired to do a job, no?<eos> It's not my fault. You called it off at the last minute.<eos> - Too late.<eos> They have a witness putting you at the house.
We are aware of your sister and nephew.<eos> And your new surrogate-father role.<eos> And the surrounding circumstances.<eos> It's very noble of you, Will.<eos> Mr. Reynard respects your position which is why our generous relocation package includes all three of you.
Plus, she's really old.<eos> We've got a defensible position here.<eos> I'll hold it as long as I can.<eos> Go to the airlock.<eos> I'm not leaving you two.
We exchange hostages.<eos> One of yours for Avasarala.<eos> So I know you won't shoot us down after we launch.<eos> This is a pleasure yacht, not a gunship.<eos> But I'll escort you to the hangar myself.
At the time, I didn't know he was a crazy homeless guy.<eos> He was so passionate.<eos> I thought he was some kind of preacher.<eos> So I got caught up listening.<eos> There was some people there, maybe five or six, and he was going on and on, he's saying, "He loves you.
Renegotiating the terms of our partnership.<eos> And it is going to be a partnership.<eos> We need a bit more of a guarantee that you're going to uphold your end of our bargain.<eos> I'll guarantee you one thing.<eos> If you don't open that door, I'll kill you.
You... you... you take it.<eos> We'd like you to join us.<eos> We can give you a home, a team, and a place to better train the use of your power.<eos> I can take care of myself.<eos> Oh, and, uh, if you get in my way, I'll send the 3 of you back to star city with your nuts in a sling.
Why did Chase split up all the hostages?<eos> Why does Chase do anything?<eos> So far, he hasn't laid out a single hoop you could keep yourself from jumping through.<eos> Maybe leaving me here was part of the plan.<eos> How'd Chase get you here?
To Star City, Mayor Oliver Queen is a hero.<eos> This marks only the second time in the 140-year history of this city that a mayor has faced impeachment.<eos> In 1898, Mayor Prescott was removed from office.<eos> We'll see what fate awaits Oliver Queen, who's stepping into the building now.<eos> Hey, I'll catch you up there, all right?
The royal courtyard.<eos> Big.<eos> And the famed castle murals.<eos> Are we to simply believe that he is the heir?<eos> Look, I don't blame you for being cautious.
All right. Where do they usually hang out?<eos> These days?<eos> Guyana.<eos> My bros, my bros.<eos> Your girlfriends don't accept you.
Your girlfriends don't accept you.<eos> They want to change you.<eos> They want to make your apartment look more "adult."<eos> They want to make you a new dude.<eos> But I accept you as the dude that you are.
Mr Malone's allegation was investigated and found to be unsubstantiated.<eos> Not quite, sir.<eos> I stand corrected.<eos> Found to be down to misinterpretation.<eos> So if you'll excuse me, my sergeant here will show you out, allowing me to get on with my enquiries.
If we besiege the city with foreigners, we prove her point.<eos> Our army should be Westerosi.<eos> And I suppose we're providing the Westerosi?<eos> You are.<eos> Lady Greyjoy will escort you home to Sunspear.
Your boss doesn't seem to have an I.D., record, somehow even a name.<eos> You got all those, Mr. Moon, record especially.<eos> Lawyer.<eos> Didn't catch that.<eos> You're probably asking yourself about now how it came to pass that two country-fried police even found you at that motel for a crime committed over... count 'em...
-Shut the fuck up!<eos> -Arghh! Shut the fuck up before I fucking kill you!<eos> Stop it!<eos> I'm trying to read.<eos> Well, I might as well introduce you to everyone.
Have you ever even seen combat?<eos> How dare you treat these men without dignity and respect!<eos> Apologies, gentlemen.<eos> Our intel failed to inform us that there was a prison here.<eos> My current mission doesn't concern you, or else I'd invite you to come play with us 'cause we could surely use men of your caliber.
And I know that I'm the reason for that.<eos> Iris's death shouldn't have driven me away from you all.<eos> I mean... I mean, it should've driven me closer.<eos> This isn't what she would want.<eos> But I'm here now to tell you that... no matter what happens in the past, I will not abandon you.
Can you make it to Garrity Gulch?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I think so, yes.<eos> Copy that.<eos> The extraction team will meet you there just as soon as possible.
No idea.<eos> Do you have any sense who the message could be from?<eos> No.<eos> Trish, could this text be from the man that you slept with on the morning you were attacked?<eos> I told you, I'm not talking about him.
God.<eos> May God be with him.<eos> You just watch over Ragnar, hm?<eos> Good luck, little brother.<eos> See you all in Dunholm.
Prisoners.<eos> Listen to us. Count Olaf is...<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> You listen to me, little boy, and you listen very carefully.<eos> The only reason why Count Olaf hasn't torn you limb from limb is because he hasn't gotten a hold of your fortune.
No, no, no, no.<eos> You listen to me, little boy, and you listen very carefully.<eos> The only reason why Count Olaf hasn't torn you limb from limb is because he hasn't gotten a hold of your fortune.<eos> But you ask yourself this question, all of you:<eos> What reason would he have to keep you alive after he's got your money?
If I were you, I would look away before viewing any of the horrible and horrifying events that comprise this ghastly new episode... in the Baudelaires' unfortunate lives.<eos> It's a brand-new episode in your lives, Baudelaires.<eos> In a few minutes you'll be meeting your new guardian, Dr. Montgomery.<eos> He's your closest living relative and apparently should've been your guardian all along, according to your deceased parents' will.<eos> I'm beginning to think it was a mistake to listen to that oddly-dressed consultant who walked into my office with no references and no identification, and who suggested that I place you in Count Olaf's care.
He's your closest living relative and apparently should've been your guardian all along, according to your deceased parents' will.<eos> I'm beginning to think it was a mistake to listen to that oddly-dressed consultant who walked into my office with no references and no identification, and who suggested that I place you in Count Olaf's care.<eos> My siblings and I wholeheartedly agree.<eos> You're disgrace to your profession.<eos> My recently-rehired secretary Jacquelyn is nervous that Count Olaf is still at large, but I don't think Olaf will be able to find you way out here.
Uh, let me just unlock all these important security measures and I'll join you in the Reptile Room!<eos> Retinal scan one.<eos> Retinal scan two.<eos> I am so sorry, Baudelaires, that you were frightened by that man who arrived earlier.<eos> Um, it makes sense that you were alarmed, being that he chased you up and down the stairs with a knife.
Who were we supposed to meet there?<eos> I know you children have a great many questions, and I promise there are a great many answers.<eos> Find your Aunt Josephine.<eos> She's a fierce and formidable woman.<eos> She can keep you safe and tell you everything you need to know.
Look, he's damaged goods.<eos> I can reach him.<eos> The story of this conspiracy starts in Afghanistan.<eos> Until we understand that, we don't understand anything.<eos> "And you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free."
Jump, I mean.<eos> -Well, we're all required to log 500 hours before we're certified, so yes.<eos> -Any advice tor first timers?<eos> Well...<eos> Have you ever had those dreams where you know you're asleep, but everyone else around you thinks it's real?
-Sir.<eos> -I'm Captain Suthers.<eos> Thank you for making the jump on such short notice.<eos> We're happy to help.<eos> How is the 21st century treating you so far?
It's like you're just falling over her.<eos> You know, I gotta say, I'm glad we got coffee this trip.<eos> Hey.<eos> I just wanted you to know that I arrived.<eos> I miss you already.
- Yeah.<eos> I'm glad I met him when I did.<eos> Sort of marches to the beat of his own drummer, doesn't he?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> I was watching you two at the meeting. You looked very cute together.
And I am giving it to the Belt.<eos> Okay.<eos> Now the time.<eos> Other ship come, take you load for Earth, for Mars.<eos> They take you, okay?
Come on. Get up!<eos> All Inners, this way.<eos> Time to go.<eos> Inners only.<eos> Good ship gonna take you home, yeah?
- Good afternoon, Mr. And Ms. Stroblekowitz.<eos> How're y'all doing today?<eos> - Very well, thank you.<eos> - Mr. Seeker's ready for you.<eos> Flynn'll be taking you upstairs.
- Yes, Mr. Beaker.<eos> - Cherry, can you send Paul in, please?<eos> - Right away.<eos> I, uh,<eos> I didn't expect you so soon.
They said, only you knew the answer.<eos> Most prisoners who end up here, have no hope.<eos> I thought I might help...<eos> You come twice a week with flowers for him?<eos> And he turns you away?
I just popped home for some lunch.<eos> I'm not interrupting?<eos> - Not at all, sir.<eos> - Right.<eos> Well, I'll leave you to it.
It's Time Jail for you, Entropy.<eos> You haven't seen the last of me, Time Ryder.<eos> I'll be back!<eos> Yeah!<eos> Now, before I take you back to your present,
The CIA mind control program?<eos> They gave people LSD and filmed them dorking hookers and stuff.<eos> You're saying the CIA or the MKUltrons or whoever made a mind-controlling video game that kills people and they left it here at Wilma's. In Beaverton.<eos> You should run, children.<eos> It won't save you, but it might just buy you some time.
So, the only thing you succeeded in doing was bringing us all together.<eos> Oh, Eleanor.<eos> That's it!<eos> My big mistake was bringing you all together, having you be soul mates living next to each other.<eos> Next time, I'll spread you out so it's more of a slow burn.
I handled that shit.<eos> So what's the guy who stabbed Shin doing here if Milan's out of the picture?<eos> I'm still working with Petar and the rest of the Serbs.<eos> But Julio is the distro now.<eos> He'll keep you in weight, like I always did.
Yes.<eos> The cops were... in their rooms.<eos> Went through their things.<eos> When I get out, I'll make it up to them, okay?<eos> When I get out, I'll make it up to all of you.
My gosh, I am so sorry.<eos> Is... Is that a Jewish thing?<eos> It's a human being thing.<eos> It's disgusting. Look, I get it.<eos> Things went sideways on your last job and it threw you. But this is not the answer.
All right, I'll get you a warrant.<eos> And let me know if you hear anything.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Here he is.<eos> - What can I help you with?
US passport doesn't mean shit anymore.<eos> That's over.<eos> - So, we just wait? - Yup.<eos> I'll be back.<eos> And then we will get you all safe and sound to the magical land of the north.
What is this place? Welcome.<eos> Do you have a reservation with us this evening?<eos> - Yes, under Rhoades.<eos> - Of course, yes.<eos> Mr. and Mrs. Rhoades. We've been expecting you.
So, none of it goes in the book?<eos> - No, it all goes in.<eos> - Good.<eos> With regards to the debt ceiling, I think we can all agree that none of us wants to play politics with the full faith and credit of the United States.<eos> I brought you here...
I shut down the government for wasting our money.<eos> I shut down the government for interfering with our clocks and watches.<eos> I shut down the post office because everybody just uses email anyway.<eos> I shut down NPR because they're a total snoozefest, and they said this shutdown was a bad idea.<eos> I shut down the national parks so that your parents will have to take you someplace cool on vacation, like Disney World or Cancun or Mexico.
Boing! - I know it.<eos> - Leon West, Ma'am.<eos> - Ah, Leon! Woodward minus Bernstein plus Propecia.<eos> Ooh. This entire conversation is off the record.<eos> You are going to retract every word this very nanosecond. Otherwise, I'm gonna sue you.
If you go through with this and your husband decides to put up a fight, you will be branded as a whore.<eos> You'll be stigmatised, as will your daughter.<eos> And, given the church's position on divorce, I'd be very careful about any relationship with Mr Chambers... if you want him to keep his job.<eos> I told you to be more careful.<eos> Well, I'll leave you to it.
You can find me a room, one with no windows.<eos> Can I sit?<eos> Of course.<eos> We were married here, Liza and I.<eos> Romanov married you?
I don't know any prayers!<eos> I will say a prayer.<eos> Hild.<eos> Please.<eos> Let us pray that God and all his saints and all his angels in Heaven, smile and bless you.
Alvin.<eos> - "And you will know the truth."<eos> - This is important.<eos> This is so important.<eos> - "And the truth will set you free."
They are Russian-made land mines, 300,000 of them, flooded the market after Russia pulled out of Afghanistan.<eos> Browning Reed bought them, legally, and used them for our Demining training.<eos> My attorney has all the import permits on file.<eos> Here's his card. Hmm.<eos> Though, I expect he'll contact you first, once he's pulled together the charges for the illegal search and seizure.
And he is capable of love.<eos> He was in a relationship with Kat, and he loved her.<eos> Or he was playing her to get what he needed.<eos> The same way you played Jeffrey Kantor.<eos> Shepherd trained both of you to manipulate people.
If you don't lay back and listen to reason, - he's gonna kill you.<eos> - Shut up!<eos> You are trespassing on US Government property!<eos> I'm not playing around, kid.<eos> No, you keep screwing around, that guy's gonna jack you up.
You don't have a migraine, do you?<eos> You guys have fun.<eos> I'll see you later.<eos> When they're gone.<eos> See you in the morning.
He killed them.<eos> Turn around.<eos> - They're vampires, Dad.<eos> - Vampires?<eos> I'm taking you to the church, where vampires can't go.
- Rainer.<eos> Can I come in for a moment?<eos> I'm kind of busy.<eos> Is there something I should know?<eos> I'll take you to the doctor.
Very nice, baby.<eos> Yeah. Right?<eos> This is my favorite part.<eos> Calabasas homeowners, are you ready to save?<eos> I can't hear you.
- He's Count Olaf.<eos> Baudelaires, I've been more than patient with you.<eos> I understand that losing your parents and your home has had an emotional effect, as I imagine it would have on many people.<eos> I've done the best I can to find a suitable home for you, but nothing I do seems to be good enough.<eos> And now, faced with a perfectly legal last will and testament that will place you in the care of a sailor you met yesterday, you start to spout these wild, McCarthyesque accusations.
A number of concerned people are worried that if you watch the Baudelaire orphans steal a sailboat and sail across Lake Lachrymose in the middle of Hurricane Herman...<eos> We're gonna steal a sailboat, sail across Lake Lachrymose in the middle of Hurricane Herman.<eos> you might be tempted to do such a thing yourself.<eos> We're stealing these, too.<eos> So allow me to offer you a piece of advice, even though I don't know anything about you.
Okay, fine.<eos> You and Jennifer can go in through the front door. We're gonna need a distraction.<eos> You buy us as much time as possible.<eos> Once we have the Word,<eos> Jones will pull you back.
- Anybody who doesn't belong.<eos> - Like us?<eos> Oh, no, you're fine.<eos> This is a mining town.<eos> Just need to tell people I pulled you out of a dark hole.
Let it have this level.<eos> We'll go someplace else.<eos> - Where would we go?<eos> - It's everywhere.<eos> Even with a place all of its own, the virus will never leave you alone.
Tonight I ask for your prayers for all those who grieve.<eos> For the children whose worlds have been shattered.<eos> Through the valley of the shadow of death, I fear no evil for you are with me.<eos> Thank you.<eos> May god bless you and may god bless Eden.
It'll tear you and your mother apart.<eos> Tear us apart?<eos> What about you?<eos> You're her husband.<eos> You don't think this whole thing is pushing you away?
Dr. Minnick assigned me to you.<eos> All right, I will, um...<eos> I'll talk to Dr. Minnick after I finish up here, but no, thanks. I don't need anyone.<eos> Okay, sorry. You all set?<eos> Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow.
Fine payment for a simple murder.<eos> There's a ravine near here, and everyone will think he crashed during a supply run.<eos> They wouldn't believe it.<eos> They'll trace it back to you two.<eos> You think the king will defend you?
And, hey, we're not done talking about this birthday, man.<eos> If you don't die, we're gonna have a lot to celebrate.<eos> - Can't hear you.<eos> - Yeah, you could hear me.<eos> If you're in pain or need medical attention, please move to this side of the tent and a doctor will see you as soon as possible.
U-uh, n-neighbors, my hardworking staff.<eos> But the one who deserves the most credit, is my beautiful wife, Jessica.<eos> She's the one who never gets thanked, the unsung hero of all our success.<eos> If it wasn't for everything she does, there would never be a Cattleman's Ranch, let alone an award for me to accept.<eos> Now, I know most of you are here tonight because she forced you into coming by sheer will.
Do you want the pain to stop?<eos> Do you want to purge the guilt weighing you down in that chair?
Now... someone is going to tell me where she went.<eos> Are you really going to protect her?<eos> She doesn't care about you.<eos> I'm the one who cares.<eos> Snow White doesn't love you.
You fall in love with someone.<eos> You tell them, uh, that you love them, and then you share with them what you think is the single most horrifying fact about yourself.<eos> They're gonna think it's something else.<eos> But...<eos> For example, I would tell you, I love you so much.
This was mine.<eos> Things sure have changed.<eos> But in a way, they've stayed exactly the same.<eos> As we forge our new path together, we must remain focused on what's really important... not material success or wealth, but this, the spirit of innovation... a few coders, some ramen, and a dream.<eos> And that is why I brought you here.
I'd wager you've already got blood on your hands for her.<eos> If I tell you anything, what happens to me?<eos> To Guero?<eos> We'll put you both in witness protection.<eos> United States government will keep you safe and sound.
Inside are portals to every realm.<eos> I used it to escape Oz.<eos> Escape? Why did you need to escape your own realm?<eos> Look, there isn't much time.<eos> It's easier if I show you.
The aisle was right here... where your parents gave you away.<eos> The only time they gave me away was when I was a baby.<eos> Mom, stop it.<eos> They walked you to the altar.<eos> That's where you exchanged vows, in front of all your friends and family who love you.
Quick engineering job.<eos> We can cover it.<eos> You and Cabe go get Paige's pi√±atas, then meet us out there, so we can start Toby and Happy's party once we're done.<eos> Sounds good.<eos> We'll catch up with you in a bit.
And when you're done, I'll remotely open the door so you can exit.<eos> You lock the scientists in?<eos> They can always request to leave.<eos> But the 20-minute delay, it allows for reflection and avoids any rash decisions that could ruin a multimillion-dollar venture.<eos> Now, I've got a van that's gonna take you all to the dome in the Camino Desert.
Don't blame me.<eos> I'm a neat freak.<eos> Salvatore Roselli, I presume.<eos> Who the hell are you guys?<eos> That bastard Kapper send you?
Or is that what you want?<eos> No.<eos> Emperor!<eos> Your guards are dead, and you are next!<eos> Your choices have clearly led you here, as have mine.
Yeah, I wasn't given much of a choice, and I'm not sure why you're here.<eos> We just need to inspect some cargo that you're hauling.<eos> Inspections are traditionally done in the port of exit or entry.<eos> Yeah, well, this is one of those nontraditional inspections.<eos> Just follow me below deck; I'll bring you to your cargo.
Now she'll take every step necessary to dismantle the task force, starting with Ressler.<eos> Without the task force,<eos> Reddington would be completely exposed.<eos> All right, I have the address.<eos> Routing backup to meet you there now.
- Getting a seat.<eos> - In the back?<eos> Morning, folks.<eos> These are fine.<eos> Sorry to drag you all in here on such a glorious day.
Which is why...<eos> I will be stepping down as alderman.<eos> I would like to nominate Tamara Jones to fill my seat.<eos> Tamara is a public school teacher, and an advocate for the voiceless in this city.<eos> So while me and my fellow first responders will continue to put our lives on the line for you, I urge you to give your voice to Tamara because this woman will not go unheard.
I don't know, and, really, why is that relevant?<eos> I have PE today. What should I do with the doll then?<eos> That is a problem you will have to deal with.<eos> The point of this is to understand the impact having a baby would have on your life.<eos> I will see you all at the end of the day to check on your dolls.
- No! No, listen, this affects you too.<eos> I seriously doubt that.<eos> - [snarling] - [all screaming] Hi, there.<eos> We tried taking your town peacefully, stuffing you all in a cramped cave, [chuckles] but it didn't work, did it?<eos> We can all admit that, right? So this time, we're stuffing you in a cramped stomach.
Because I don't want the people watching us to hear what I'm going to say next.<eos> You guys got this up?<eos> Streaming now.<eos> Ok, uh, listen, you're gonna hear a lot of weird stuff, like Spence saying he is the father of Cat's baby.<eos> Don't let that distract you.
We'll need the garage's computing power to run the imaging technology.<eos> I'll-I'll do it!<eos> I mean, I don't want to see Happy until tonight, so I'll just stay back.<eos> And I'll handle all the wedding details, make sure everything gets up to San Jose.<eos> And Toby and I'll see you at the altar.
Eggs.<eos> We need eggs.<eos> Eggs!<eos> Welcome to Valley Marketplace, where we always treat you like family, even if you're a cheating whore.
"Elebate the peet! Elebate... Elebate the peet."<eos> "What the fuck is 'elebate'?" "Just lift!<eos> Lift the pucking peet!<eos> Are you stupid?"<eos> And I'm not... I'm not shitting on you for being a nurse.
Shit on my dream right there.<eos> Just looked at me and went like this: "Joseph, who told you you were funny?"<eos> "It wasn't me."<eos> That's fucked up.<eos> I'm just saying... You're a nurse, God bless you.
All right, we got to go.<eos> Everyone lift the camera on the count of three.<eos> One, two... (kids groaning)<eos> Welcome.<eos> In honor of Mother's Day on Sunday, each of our grades will wow you with a song or dazzle you with a skit.
Welcome.<eos> In honor of Mother's Day on Sunday, each of our grades will wow you with a song or dazzle you with a skit.<eos> Mothers and mother-like caregivers, prepare to be appreciated.<eos> (quietly): Oh, God, squatting is so hard.<eos> And now, our fourth graders will take you back to the Old West, with "Mom on the Range!"
We are Marines.<eos> Now take my advice and get the fu... out of here.<eos> You're on the wrong side of this, Swagger.<eos> Not the first time. Won't be the last.<eos> Leave, or my guys bury you in the sand outside the gate.
You came to Chicago for a reason, didn't you?<eos> To meet Devon.<eos> Where are we gonna meet him?<eos> Palwaukee Airport, private runway.<eos> There'll be a plane waiting for you.
- This wasn't the first test, Grug. - [screams]<eos> Okay, so it may be deadly, or it may be the cure.<eos> What we need is to test it, and there's only one man for the job.<eos> - Is there a second man for the job?<eos> This goo will either cure you, or, uh, well... there's this pile of pigrats back there.
Bilal, go check on the shipment!<eos> I miss you, girl.<eos> Hi, George.<eos> It's nice of y'all to visit.<eos> I thought Camila might have been keeping you in the cage with her.
Wouldn't do anyone any good if he got to her.<eos> When you authorized Reddington's immunity deal, you knew that we would have to let him maintain his criminal empire.<eos> That's what makes him valuable to us.<eos> You're a big boy, Harold.<eos> You knew we'd support you as long as you kept the deal hidden.
No, I didn't mean that.<eos> In fact, I detected the opposite when you found out Chantal's attacker was still at large.<eos> You seemed invigorated.<eos> I meant when you found out that Roy was dead, you seemed disappointed that you didn't get to hurt him.<eos> Mr. Winthrop will see you now.
We got eyes on his social media.<eos> But it's about as exciting as your average soccer mom's.<eos> Take a look.<eos> "Ten old sitcom stars that are getting fat.<eos> Number six will amaze you."
Yeah.<eos> But I didn't take that picture.<eos> He put that up online.<eos> That's the only way I get to see them anymore.<eos> I'm telling you.
‚ô™ Even when my skin dries away ‚ô™<eos> ‚ô™ I'll be back someday ‚ô™<eos> ‚ô™ To unleash my return ‚ô™<eos> Let's go.<eos> We have to check you. That's cool, right?
And this is only the beginning.<eos> I booked Christine to keep the party going.<eos> Christine? For real?<eos> That's amazing!<eos> I'll head to the hotel to grab your present and I'll see you there.
It doesn't matter what else you accomplish in life.<eos> See, people are under the misapprehension that their life is like a motion picture that will be remembered as such, but it's not.<eos> It's just a photograph, you know?<eos> A still photograph, and that's unfortunately how it is.<eos> But, you know, like, if you think your son will remember you as,
Give these kids some free passes for the grand opening tomorrow.<eos> Except for him, no dogs allowed.<eos> How rude.<eos> So you're not arresting them?<eos> Fine. But I'm watching you.
Mr. Holdout, you could remember the ridiculously long name of a long-dead parrot and every other detail about the pirates. But when it came to reciting a poem that might lead us to suspect you, you had conveniently forgotten it.<eos> You also were surprised to hear Brenda and Tommie had gone missing, but not that the Salty Brick had been stolen.<eos> And when we made a noise in the secret passageway you all looked towards the painting, whereas the police assumed, when we made a noise in their wall, that it must have come from outside.<eos> Wait, you were where now?<eos> You even said to Mr. Monkfish when he was accusing you that you would see the boardwalk destroyed before you sold it to him.
Put a pin in that.<eos> Congratulations, Texas.<eos> Texas was almost the third state... uh, but then a judge put the kibosh on it.<eos> You should know this.<eos> I'm not blaming you for not knowing about this law, because we've been...
That was such a vague and hard game show.<eos> 'Cause we never narrowed it down what it was, I could know.<eos> And the one time that guy guessed it, I lied.<eos> No, fat feet, I'm talking about our other show.<eos> We take you now to a big midtown New York City diner, where even ice cream tastes bad.
There's an old saying:<eos> "A ship in the harbor is safe.<eos> But that's not what ships are for."<eos> The greatest fear of all is the fear of the unknown.<eos> Will you let that fear define you?
"Gold Tower Hotel<eos> Tomorrow, 8:00 p.m. Francisco."<eos> And I just remembered the Gospel according to Matthew where He says:<eos> "Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake.<eos> Blessed are you when men revile you and persecute you.
You must know that.<eos> I know Speakers are nomadic tribes.<eos> You seem to have been here a while.<eos> And how do you know that?<eos> Because the locals are blaming you for the attacks.
Once you left, we were defenseless.<eos> My people are trying to hold out, but the Galra are too powerful.<eos> The lions are on their way.<eos> Hold your ground and protect your people until we arrive.<eos> Voltron stands with you.
You're on your way.<eos> "Fast" Eddie Edwards.<eos> - Mr. Edwards.<eos> - Mr. Target.<eos> I just wanted to say to you and to all of you... what an honor this is and... I promise not to let you or the Olympic Team down.
The birds can't breathe.<eos> So all of you died because of the pollution?<eos> Right.<eos> What about the gas masks?<eos> They didn't save you?
MAN". Okay, Holly...<eos> What do you want me to do with them?<eos> Look, pal, you already got our statements.<eos> Can I go see my daughter now?<eos> Sir, I was told to keep you here, so I'm keeping you here.
Excuse me.<eos> I am so sorry.<eos> Go to your mommy! My kitties!<eos> Mom will feed you.<eos> Mom loves you.
What about two bodies in the waste lot?<eos> Right next to the police station?<eos> And what should I have told them?<eos> Good job guys, you recognized me, it was me who killed Komarov.<eos> Please come to my car, I'll take you to a quieter place and kill you there not from a service weapon. Right?
Ew. no way.<eos> Well anyway. you two girls with the same name,<eos> I thank you so much for your time.<eos> And I give you the Au Revoir that I should have given you before.<eos> I thank you.
ALL THIS PROVES IS SHE'S A VOYEURISTIC SLUT<eos> WITH SOME KIND OF FUCKING RODENT FETISH. -YEAH.<eos> -HOW IN ANY WAY DOES THIS PROVE<eos> -THAT HE'S NOT WILLING TO DO THIS SHIT?<eos> -[KATIE] I'LL TELL YOU HOW.
Harry, we have to get rid of Hunter, all right?<eos> I'm not asking.<eos> I'm telling.<eos> You represent me, not him.<eos> Okay, look, well, actually, technically, full disclosure, I represent both of you.
I called right away, you guys were just the first ones to get back to me.<eos> No, no, this is great.<eos> Thanks for your time, we'll be in touch.<eos> Hey, guys, listen.<eos> I was thinking about applying to the academy in the fall and I was just wondering if maybe you'd put in a good word, tell 'em I helped you out.
It's just like the one we had.<eos> Get on up there, man.<eos> Ride off into the sunset.<eos> Actually just to the end of the driveway 'cause that horse isn't allowed on the street.<eos> But I did get you a limo to take you to the airport, so...
An asylum created by a German.<eos> It is said that their treatments are very good.<eos> They will dig a hole in the ground and shove lunatics in there.<eos> And cover it up.<eos> If the patients are not that bad, they will restrain you to the bed.
My name is Mads, and I'm a police officer.<eos> INTERPRETER TRANSLATES Your colleague, Andriy's son, died a few nights ago.<eos> He died because he was working in unsafe conditions.<eos> That's illegal.<eos> It's not your fault, but that of the people who forced you to work.
in a job we got from our probation officer or an outreach program<eos> - or what have you. - Aw, shit, you can't live off that shit.<eos> So this seems to be the play.<eos> But I just wanna say this, and I'm not tryin' to be melodramatic.<eos> I am looking out for you.
They're Choi Dong Hen's men.<eos> - Find them!<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> You two couldn't even deal with an old man.<eos> What do I keep you around for?
Can you hear it?<eos> - What?<eos> Can you heart it now?<eos> Yes.<eos> The man who took you.
Police, fire and emergency medical services will be unavailable until tomorrow morning at 7 a.m.<eos> And, for the first time since its inception, no one has been granted special immunity from the Purge.<eos> No citizen or group will be exempt.<eos> Blessed be our New Founding Fathers, and America, a nation reborn.<eos> May God be with you all.
Look, these are the real victims of the Purge.<eos> The people that the NFFA are trying to eliminate so that they don't have to take care of them anymore.<eos> These men that are armed, you'll have them at all the entrances and the rooftop?<eos> Yes.<eos> My men will keep you safe.
Great.<eos> So what were you running from?<eos> Something Thomas did not believe in five minutes ago.<eos> Come on, let's go to my place.<eos> I'll explain it to you.
So, what happens now?<eos> My buddy called from Atlanta, that job is still available.<eos> I don't have a record now, so I can leave the state.<eos> He says it starts next Monday.<eos> So, I guess I won't be seeing much of you.
Deal.<eos> Deal. Why is it a deal?<eos> Don't make the deal, because we're not those guys.<eos> Show them.<eos> Give me a second before I kill you.
Cut the cord! Cut the cord!<eos> It's crazy, though!<eos> Wait, I have an even better one.<eos> So, some of you might know, I'm a second-grade teacher.<eos> I don't know if David told you.
- I bet you've heard that one before.<eos> - Elephants. Rhinos. Hippopotami.<eos> And to extend the comparison, this baby's being a monkey.<eos> Not quite tucking its chin down as it should, I suspect.<eos> You might both do better if we send you off to hospital.
Wait for my word!<eos> At least let us get eyes on.<eos> Then we know if we have to intervene.<eos> And if there's an ambush and you get entrenched?<eos> Who rescues you?
You two have to stay here and watch out for one another and take good care of Charlie.<eos> He never walks her.<eos> You're repulsive.<eos> Loser. You want me to call Ms. Newman?<eos> She'll babysit you.
Carl Lucas.<eos> I am Carl Lucas.<eos> Damn it.<eos> I'm Carl Lucas.<eos> If you don't make attempts to befriend someone, loneliness is guaranteed to eat you alive.
I have done all I can.<eos> Thank you for all you've done for us.<eos> Luke is innocent.<eos> They're not arresting Luke Cage. They're arresting Carl Lucas.<eos> Who called you?
Oh. Not at all.<eos> Claire Maddox, Perry, head of homicide.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Get out of here. Both of you.<eos> Right now. Or I'll slap you in custody.
Eleanor, if you don't pay, I'm gonna kill your husband and Mr. Franks.<eos> Kill everybody.<eos> Greetings from New York.<eos> - What'd she say?<eos> - She said to kill you all.
Motorhead, "Ace of Spades."<eos> That's what I call myself on Rebel Coup.<eos> - "Ace of Spades." That's a good omen.<eos> - Great omen.<eos> So, you have no one that loves you that is willing to pay money to get you back.
Required.<eos> Every Wednesday at 11.<eos> You have to go to at least 10 of them a year if you want to graduate.<eos> Might as well get started today!<eos> To you who join us today for the first time... to you who enter your final year... looking out at the prospect of what may seem to be... an uncertain and dangerous horizon... menaced as this country may be by enemies both foreign and native... fear not, puzzle not... hesitate not... for the spirit of Winesburg... will animate and fortify you.
Oh, it's just fine.<eos> I'll be inside directly.<eos> I hope you won't be alone.<eos> I assure you, I will not be.<eos> If you mess this up for me, my hand to God... I will lynch every one of you come mornin!
- ready to ask about privacy.<eos> This is a concern to many people, and so it should be.<eos> I mean, this is something that matters to us.<eos> And let me just say, uh, I understand nobody wants to feel like they're being watched.<eos> So let me just tell you, when you come to Deep Dream, when you use our service, no one will be watching you.
No. No.<eos> There's no sign of them.<eos> What do you want us to do?<eos> Work your way down the canal.<eos> I'll circle around and meet you there.
- Put your hand up if you've. - Ever been sad before.<eos> Look around.<eos> Everyone's hand is up.<eos> Everyone goes through hard times.<eos> Know that in each one of those times when you went through difficulty, God was with you.
All right? I'll work double shifts.<eos> I'll get a second job if I have to.<eos> Okay, whatever it takes, I'm gonna do.<eos> I really appreciate you coming by.<eos> I got to say, I miss having you here.
I am also resigning.<eos> Please, stop it.<eos> Don't go please, I'm sorry.<eos> Please forgive me<eos> I beg you, please stop.
- Mac, how do you propose you do that.<eos> - We will sue you, whatever it takes!<eos> - And you'd probably win.<eos> But you can't afford to sue me.<eos> I'd bury you in court costs alone.
And we have reason to believe that he's killed himself. Oh, my God!<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I'm...<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> He wanted you to know, he wanted all of you to know he loved you... he loved you very much.
Thank you, Bob.<eos> This is it.<eos> All right, let's go.<eos> Here are the transcripts.<eos> The judge will see you gentlemen shortly.
Hey, hey!<eos> Do it!<eos> It beats getting eaten by Trolls.<eos> Come on!<eos> Or let me loose and I'll take you straight to Eretria.
But when it comes to the boy, - I know what's best.<eos> - Oh, is that right?<eos> And what's best is not to be fielding ideas from a talking cockroach.<eos> This coming from a talking monkey.<eos> I can still hear you, you know.
But what if you're not elected?<eos> We're doing our best to make sure that I am.<eos> Tell your friends that if they need something, they can come and see me.<eos> Be strong.<eos> And whether I win or lose, I promise that I will help you.
Give us the dream!<eos> Make some noise for the one and only!<eos> The dream!<eos> We love you!<eos> I love you too.
Children from all over Africa will be there.<eos> It is sponsored by the United Nations.<eos> Is it not far?<eos> A thousand miles away.<eos> That bus of yours would not get you there.
You have no idea.<eos> So, you're saying we should steal from other people's cars?<eos> I said no such thing.<eos> And I will deny it to the board of education.<eos> No, I'm just inspiring you to follow that automotive dream and keep your hands off the Chevy impala.
Thank you, thank you fans and friends. Thank you.<eos> And now, you gals and guys, a few words to the wise.<eos> You are my best pals and to look your best for the big contest, be yourself and have a ball.<eos> That's what it's about after all, forget about the camera and forget the beat and give the folks at home a real treat.<eos> Don't worry where the camera is, if I tap you on the shoulder just step aside and let the others finish the ride.
But first a word from our sponsors.<eos> The one, the only national bandstand coming to you live from Rydell high hosted by the one, the only Vince Fontaine.<eos> That's me.<eos> And now, the moment you've all been waiting for. The national danceoff.<eos> One lucky guy and gal will go home with a fan task prize. Don't feel bad if I bump you out, it doesn't matter if you win or lose, it's what you do with your dancing shoes.
‚ô™ take a deep breath and sigh ‚ô™<eos> ‚ô™ good-bye to Sandra Dee ‚ô™<eos> I'm sorry<eos> Attention, seniors.<eos> Before the merriment of commencement commences, I hope your years with us here at Rydell high have prepared you for the challenges you face.
Rosa Diaz.<eos> Some of us even love her so much that it makes us act a little crazy sometimes.<eos> You're talking about me, right?<eos> Yeah!<eos> Ah, I would kill all of you for her.
Strawberry.<eos> Ha ha! What are you guys, like health nuts or something?<eos> Yeah, something like that.<eos> Healthy.<eos> So, what brings you up to the woods?
Who said there's gonna be a next time?<eos> Oh, you're a little bit of a bitch, ain't you?<eos> You need to be a lot better if you want to get signed.<eos> I've seen high school bands play better than you do.<eos> Your one saving grace... People hate you.
The victims, who were badly beaten and suffered severe blunt trauma to the head, have yet to be identified.<eos> Hey!<eos> "Cha Cha Twist."<eos> Oh, man.<eos> I told you yesterday, I'm not recording any more bullshit dance records.
Cursing you with consciousness.<eos> Gary. I'm just like you.<eos> A handyman trying to fix up a cosmic shack with a nail here and a lick of paint there.<eos> Knowing that the building really needs to be condemned.<eos> People say that I made you in my image, but the truth is, you made me in yours.
He got stuck in the back because of the prisoner locks and he died of heatstroke.<eos> [sighs] I know you mean well, but just stop trying to help.<eos> But I want to help.<eos> All I want is to be the daughter I should have been this whole time.<eos> Just tell me what I can do, and I won't let you down.
You can whip it, starve it, push it deep down in your insides.<eos> But you can't pull it out of you.<eos> If your heart knows where it belongs you'll fight with the whole world to get there.<eos> A wise man once said it's truly a blessing to be in love.<eos> Let it possess you.
Oh, my baby!<eos> Please!<eos> Mommy!<eos> Hey.<eos> I went into town and turned you in.
Pretty fucking pathetic.<eos> I think we've all learned our lesson here.<eos> Hayden, I say when lessons have been learned.<eos> Lessons have been learned.<eos> Now Mr. Hayden's gonna take you to your rooms, since he caused this whole entire debacle. - I'm sorry, what?
Can I help you, gentlemen?<eos> Is the bar still open?<eos> - Yes, of course, sir.<eos> - Perfect.<eos> Allow me to escort you.
They still celebrate World Expositions -in this century? - Yes.<eos> - And what is that?<eos> - Amelia will explain on the way.<eos> Door... 2020.<eos> In one hour an agent will be waiting for you in Seville.
In my office?<eos> Ah, of course, yes.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> While we look for a place to set you up,<eos> Ernesto will accompany you around the Ministry and clarify any doubts that you might have.
They get lost and we've had a few incidents where they don't get back.<eos> I can come by tomorrow at noon and we can conduct that interview... but I gotta be honest.<eos> I don't have a lot to tell you.<eos> But as we discussed, you can go, ask wiggenstein, he's the owner of the island, well, he's actually the owner of the hotel that you're staying at.<eos> So I'll see you tomorrow at noon. - Great.
Early Sunday morning, two guys broke into his office and removed a number of surveillance devices.<eos> - So? - So, next time you send your guys in to take a hidden camera out of a target's office, you might want to find out if the target has a hidden camera of his own.<eos> So?<eos> So we have video of one of your vehicles leaving the scene.<eos> How do you think we found you?
You're using my ex wife to leverage me to get to Joey Marks.<eos> What, you get the glory, we get the paperwork while you ride off into the sunset with a guy we've been chasing for years?<eos> No, that doesn't fly.<eos> Come on, make it official.<eos> Let me call my lieutenant, buy you onto the case.
You are serving a traitor.<eos> I am serving the Vice Regent, monk, at my Khan's orders.<eos> And my father sent us to stop him.<eos> Neither of you holds any authority.<eos> Put your weapons down, and I'll bring you to the Prince and the Vice Regent.
Previously, on "Legends of Tomorrow"...<eos> Savage has kept his movements hidden throughout history, but professor Aldus Boardman is the world's leading expert.<eos> - Savage was an Egyptian priest.<eos> - Kendra and I reincarnate.<eos> And every time he kills you, it passes to him.
I'm calling my lawyer.<eos> You do that.<eos> In the meantime, we'll get started.<eos> Hey, boys. Come here.<eos> I'm gonna need you to come upstairs, call your folks, have them come and pick you up.
What you said the other night, that I don't deserve this.<eos> I really needed to hear that.<eos> I do deserve better.<eos> And you do, too.<eos> Look, you guys could get out of here now, and I'd only be a few weeks behind you.
Today we participate in a sacred ceremony, one that has been practiced for thousands of years.<eos> - Yep, told you.<eos> - The practice of partaking of the remarkable teaching properties of the ayahuasca.<eos> Yag√©. Shori, natem.<eos> Call it what you like, it will still take you exactly where you need to go, let you see what you need to see.
You don't have to do this.<eos> Shut up.<eos> I am talking to the man.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> I'm not gonna kill you.
-Now that medical records are available online, we'll find more leads.<eos> There are markers in your profile.<eos> Your blood pressures, certain allergies, family histories. All these details showed us the G10-12 x-sequence in your gene be accessible.<eos> -Enough.<eos> -I have seen you.
Huh, you want to mess with me?<eos> Come down here and face me!<eos> That's right!<eos> You run, you fucker!<eos> Now, you come back, and I will nail you to the fucking wall!
Something is coming.<eos> Something hungry for blood.<eos> A shadow grows on the wall behind you, swallowing you in darkness.
In the span of... say, what?<eos> A year?<eos> Nobody's gonna give a shit about any of that.<eos> But the growth that you will have missed out on?<eos> That's gonna eat you from the inside.
'Cause he's trying to trip me up, he's trying to trap me.<eos> So I had to play dirty right back at him.<eos> Followed?<eos> Where?<eos> Trapped you how? Uh... After I saw you and Axe together,
-The mayor knows he owes you.<eos> -Fuck the mayor!<eos> Listen up.<eos> I know some of y'all are gonna want to make some money this summer, so remember, Francisco Cruz is offering paying summer jobs and internships.<eos> Make sure you visit his center, tell him Ms. Green sent you.
I don't love you.<eos> And it's quits.<eos> Mylene.<eos> "Even in the darkness, there is light, for God is gracious, and tells us,<eos> 'Ye be kind to one another, tender hearted, forgiving for one another, as God in Christ forgave you.'"
- Where is she?<eos> Go!<eos> Nina?<eos> Let's get outta here.<eos> I'm taking you to the safe house.
- That's right.<eos> The unions are not just gonna open up for us on their own.<eos> Poverty is not just gonna end on its own.<eos> The Bronx is not gonna stop burning on its own!<eos> I pulled you off the corner because Annie needs y'all working the crowd.
- Meaning?<eos> - Learn to be accepting of differences.<eos> Try at least.<eos> If you're referring to that nutcase Moira you placed in my room, I beg to differ.<eos> You want me to help you because you're not capable of handling her obsessive-compulsive disorders.
How many people here think about orcs?<eos> "Orcs."<eos> Uh, okay, how about this?<eos> Uh, you're shy, you're nervous. Don't be.<eos> I'll cover my eyes. Now I can't see you. So you can all do it.
Hey! Hey! Hey!<eos> Pop!<eos> Man, don't do that.<eos> How are you, Pop?<eos> I'm a little tired, but a lot better seeing you all.
Let's get it over with.<eos> Come on. Smile.<eos> Walter, I'm so glad you could make it.<eos> We needed you more than ever this year.<eos> I think I needed you even more.
Did you do something, Mr. Finestra?<eos> Like kill Buck Rogers, maybe?<eos> No.<eos> No, I fucking told you already that I was with my father.<eos> He told you, too.
Awesome!<eos> Give me a hug, roomie!<eos> Come on, Jackson.<eos> This will be a really good thing for you and Max.<eos> It will bring you closer together.
- No.<eos> His friends...<eos> Our friends are dead.<eos> I'm afraid, there's someone following us.<eos> Hold on now. Who is following you?
Because he was embarrassed to have missed a putt in front of his grandson.<eos> Are you saying we are here because of that ancient bullshit?<eos> That's right!<eos> 16.<eos> Which is why I am presenting you with a check for $25 million minus 16, which leaves you with $9 million.
Eir√≠kur must have had a valid reason<eos> You haven't seen anything else that could be useful through your scope?<eos> No<eos> I thought you might find this thing with Kolbr√∫n interesting<eos> I'm not telling you just to gossip.
So, the war's over?<eos> Yeah, war's over.<eos> Are your affairs in order?<eos> My affairs are not in order.<eos> That's why I hired you.
Sometimes I just need to be alone.<eos> The last time you went out on your own, you came back with dog bites.<eos> And then this thing with Steve Winchell's teacher, and now you're hiding things from us.<eos> Look, I know that you're trying to keep me safe.<eos> And I know that I let you down.

You don't think I fucking know that?<eos> Yeah, we were all taken.<eos> But y'all were taken healthy.<eos> Not me.<eos> I'll bet he's comin' for me next, so I'll see the three of you on the other side.
- Obtaining the four keys allows passage beyond the gates and a return to your world.<eos> Only there can your father's soul be saved.<eos> - What the fuck?<eos> Did you just hear that?<eos> - The other world awaits you.
- T -- t -- the dagger, where'd you put the..<eos> Where'd you put the dagger?<eos> - The dagger.. The bureau!<eos> Go!<eos> - The other side awaits you.
Search the train!<eos> I speak Chinese!<eos> I'll say it clearly this time.<eos> You have two choices.<eos> One, I knock you both out.
Come on.<eos> Bikkie?<eos> Why do you reckon he calls himself Psycho Sam? Here you go.<eos> Put these on.<eos> Stop the Government from tracking you.
Are not you ashamed?<eos> - What?<eos> He's a dwarf.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Bruno saw you together.
You haven't got enough to pay us?<eos> You know who Frank Barsalona is?<eos> He runs Premier Talent. Best booking agency in town.<eos> He's also a friend.<eos> And because he's my friend, he's booking you to open for the New York Dolls next month at the Academy.
- Yeah.<eos> - Okay, great.<eos> Well, I'll tell you want.<eos> Olga's in the kitchen.<eos> Why don't you find her and ask her to take you to the pool?
Don't just stand there.<eos> Help us. You know what this means for me if it works?<eos> It'll erase my son.<eos> I can't stop you.<eos> I'm not gonna help you either.
Now, can we move on to the sex positions?<eos> 'Cause that's what I paid $80 for.<eos> Actually, that's what I paid $80 for.<eos> Yeah, don't worry, Jack.<eos> I'll pay you back, I'll pay you back.
Here are your foreign exchange certificates, and good luck to you, boys.<eos> I hope I have been an inspiration.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Okay.<eos> I hope you're de-virginized when I see you next.
Welcome to the Pleasure Palace.<eos> Please, come in.<eos> Ooh, the Pleasure Palace.<eos> You guys don't have too much fun tonight.<eos> The King will see you now.
Eh?<eos> What do you think?<eos> That I don't already have enough work?<eos> And the sea, my goodness!<eos> It can swallow you.
As the boat was at the mercy of the waves, the poet whispered to me. The instant I saw the rescuers.... close to our young stray sheep.<eos> In these troubled times when our hearts tremble. In the presence of immensity, we celebrate the Virgin of the Sea.<eos> Who with her eyes protects every sailor on his boat.<eos> The Virgin of the Sea watches over you like a beacon. She blesses the fragile vessels... keeps them away from dangerous reefs... and heads them towards the best fishing.<eos> Therefore, I call you to gather... for our prayers to the Virgin of the Sea.
No offense.<eos> I'm just saying, programmers and engineers generally don't go to a version two - unless there is...<eos> - Raven...<eos> Of course.<eos> Of course I'll help you, but I got to say, I'm fairly certain if there was an AI on the Ark, I would know.
Of course I'll help you, but I got to say, I'm fairly certain if there was an AI on the Ark, I would know.<eos> It will likely be a dormant program, that or an unfinished one.<eos> If you can gain me access to the mainframe, I can search for and download any residual code.<eos> Sounds like a plan, Red.<eos> See you on the other side.
Previously, on "Legends of Tomorrow"...<eos> Savage has kept his movements hidden throughout history, but professor Aldus Boardman is the world's leading expert.<eos> - Savage was an Egyptian priest.<eos> - Kendra and I reincarnate.<eos> And every time he kills you, it passes to him.
"Misunderstanding"?<eos> You tried to cook us!<eos> You almost shot me and you hit Spot!<eos> Not now.<eos> Algid will see you now.
I'm really sorry.<eos> Oh, baby, we'll find another way. We're gonna find another way.<eos> Yeah. We'll keep fighting. We'll keep fighting.<eos> Mrs. Kessler... your husband's under arrest.<eos> When your friend finishes getting his broken ribs patched up, I gotta take both of you directly to jail.
- Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Let's get out of here.<eos> - Take it easy now.<eos> She'll help you.
- You're a doctor?<eos> - Yeah, that's right.<eos> You have any prenatal vitamins in there?<eos> - For you?<eos> Well, uh, I was an obstetrician before, and I most definitely owe you.
I'm counting to five, and then it's off the table.<eos> - One...<eos> - We'll do it.<eos> Wise.<eos> And I'd better see you at the funeral.
Little red ones, actually.<eos> All right, all right.<eos> Not tonight, for Christ's sake.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - Constable Nixon will see you out.
Church just down the road from you.<eos> Oh... We... We thought he was at the fairground.<eos> - Oh, I thought you kept in touch.<eos> - Yeah, we did.<eos> It's just, you know, the church is, what... half a mile from your home and he didn't even call in to see you?
You're wearing your parachute.<eos> - Go, Monty, jump!<eos> - I can't!<eos> Monty, you have to.<eos> He didn't tell you, did he?
But you remember how good you felt when you saw how happy Nick was when he was able to walk Peg Leg down the plank?<eos> Right?<eos> Yeah, that's because it's really, really good to share.<eos> It's really good.<eos> In fact, as I say this, you know what, I think I'm going to take you over to Daddy's a little later on today, okay?
The poachers.<eos> They got a truck full of animals and they're gonna disappear!<eos> Do you know where they're headed?<eos> Their warehouse is just over there.<eos> No, no, no, I'm not leaving you out of my sight.
-Yes!<eos> -As always!<eos> -You're P√≠a, right?<eos> -I'm Emilia, how are you?<eos> -Can I film you? -Please!
Well, there's a sex offender at 3134 10th Street.<eos> He might.<eos> No, you do not have to go to the sex offender's house.<eos> No one has to knock on any door that makes him or her feel uncomfortable.<eos> But I do urge you all to be bold and stretch yourself.
Sounds like they'd be ready to see you hanging here as me.<eos> Lord magistrate!<eos> Our militia...<eos> Your militia has been decimated by the plague.<eos> If you think this bunch of ill-trained geezers and boys will protect you from the French and the Indians, then you are bound to be disappointed.
I can tell.<eos> Hmm?<eos> I have a confession to make.<eos> Finally!<eos> Well, the truth will set you free... isn't that what your beloved book says?
Oh, I don't.<eos> I can't.<eos> Then maybe stick within the limits of your intellectual capacity.<eos> Or maybe my simplicity offers me a different perspective.<eos> God cast you out because He needed you to do the most difficult of jobs.
What choice do I have?<eos> To ride shotgun with the Devil, for starters.<eos> If Malcolm sees you, he'll kill her.<eos> I'm sorry, but I can't risk it... her life's at stake.<eos> Right. So you're just gonna get both of you killed then, are you?
It's become one with her.<eos> You know we're not gonna be able to do anything to separate one from the other.<eos> - What does it want?<eos> - This demon this Tranguul it brings your worst nightmares to life.<eos> And through that vulnerability, possesses you.
It's huge.<eos> So what's the hot booth this year?<eos> Laser guns.<eos> But the wait is epic.<eos> Catch you two on the other side.
"See where that ends up."<eos> I feel like... the worst part, honestly, of traveling in our country is that there's no surprises.<eos> I swear to you, I travel every week, and it's really a disappointment.<eos> Every place is exactly what I thought it was going to be.<eos> You know? I can prove it to you.
And from now on, you will see me in your nightmares."<eos> And the kids are like, "What the fuck?" Like...<eos> "I'm 12. Don't talk to me like that.<eos> Man, that's crazy."<eos> And he goes, "If I ever see you again, I'll take a bite out of each of you."
Right.<eos> Maybe you could sneak me there.<eos> Are you trying to trick me? Etcetera?<eos> I'll tell on you.<eos> I'm telling on you.
There are certain energies, certain spells, which are far too powerful for one magician alone.<eos> If you lose control, they will turn against you.<eos> They will kill you.<eos> They will consume you.<eos> Change you... into something else.
That must be hard.<eos> And now she's running for Junior Class President, and her picture's plastered everywhere, so I can't get away from her.<eos> - At least you don't have to live with her.<eos> Look, if you're this hung up on her, just... get back together with her.<eos> I mean, it's not like there's some insurmountable obstacle keeping you apart.
The Ancients need sustenance, yet cannot forage for themselves. - So when the hunters go out and search for food, we must track them back to their lair, but without being seen.<eos> No, no wait!<eos> We will find them tonight.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Didn't Minow lead you to the cargo?
He treated everyone as if they were his own possession.<eos> He didn't care for anyone.<eos> So no-one cared for him.<eos> You all did at some time.<eos> Then he let you all down.
It change your life.<eos> And cheap!<eos> -Alfred!<eos> Welcome.<eos> God bless you all for undertaking the arduous journey here to meet His Holiness.
Hello, Ivar.<eos> There's no mistaking you.<eos> It appears my return is not welcome.<eos> You've obviously all made your mind up about me.<eos> I cannot blame you for that.
A nice boy called Ned is in this room.<eos> His parents live in Dubai.<eos> What sort of a boy is Ned?<eos> A voracious reader.<eos> Well I'll um... leave you to say your farewells.
Everybody shut the fuck up!<eos> Open this shit.<eos> Would you calm the fuck down, man?<eos> Everybody shut up!<eos> If you move, I'll fucking kill you!
And you think that would make me turn on Zoom?<eos> Enemy of my enemy is my friend, right?<eos> What... don't tell me it doesn't work like that over here.<eos> If I tell you, he'll kill me.<eos> But if I kill you and take you to him, I bet he'd be pretty pleased with me.
My secret lover the mailman will be sorely disappointed to be turned away.<eos> You just be safe, my love<eos> The virus is spread through bodily fluids, such as saliva and mucus.<eos> If you believe you've been exposed, it is imperative you do not come into contact with anyone.<eos> Our doctors and nurses are conducting preliminary screening and will be with you as soon as possible.
For it is written:<eos> "A prayer offered in faith "shall save the sick.<eos> And the Lord will raise him up."<eos> He will sprinkle clean water on your head.<eos> And he will cleanse you of your impurities.
That was hard to see, I know.<eos> But it's critical we know what we're facing.<eos> Many have questioned my methods.<eos> This is why I do what I do.<eos> This is what I've been protecting you from.
So we can just... sit here?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Fine with us.<eos> And you're not gonna get bored?<eos> You don't need me to entertain you?
I was gonna buy a shirt inside, but...<eos> Our tickets got stolen.<eos> Oh, well, you'll just have to pick one up at the show tomorrow night.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I think what he means is he's setting you up with V.I.P. seats.
I didn't wanna go there but I guess he's keeping it.<eos> You know how to use this thing?<eos> Yep.<eos> Now watch out for John, he's an asshole.<eos> If you screw this up I will hunt you.
Take a bite.<eos> You wanna feel again?<eos> To suffer for the blood you drank?<eos> Then come inside.<eos> The dead woman will turn you.
Look, I didn't tell you this when we were eating because of all the crazy shit happening, but I'm really glad we're back together.<eos> Me too.<eos> How'd you track us down, anyway?<eos> Was it blind luck, or... what?<eos> Well, I was following you and then I heard the bells and then later got sick.
- We certainly are.<eos> - Do you fancy having a bit of a chat?<eos> Go on then.<eos> "Go on then." There's a story about you lot getting signed to Creation.<eos> Alan McGee saw you in a club in Glasgow. Is that right?
‚ô™ Don't you cry ‚ô™<eos> ‚ô™ Go to sleepy ‚ô™<eos> ‚ô™ Little babies ‚ô™<eos> It's almost time, lovies.<eos> Uncle Bobo is finding you.
I just live in everyone's shadow.<eos> I want to be the hero instead of the one the heroes rescue.<eos> I understand that.<eos> But that's not the way to do it.<eos> I know, and that's why I'm telling you now.
No, no. There's no new CEO. There's no new employees of any kind.<eos> There's actually... It's more about you guys becoming former employees.<eos> So, look...<eos> We're heading in a different direction.<eos> And what that means is, if I haven't taken you aside and spoken to you privately about staying on, that does mean that you are... terminated, immediately.
That's what I said.<eos> I said Rickie. Thank God. How did you find us?<eos> Your Twitter account is hooked up to your phone's location services.<eos> We've been tracking you through your tweets all night.<eos> Actually, I've been tracking you all night.
For her.<eos> That's not your wife.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> How do you know?<eos> Death parted you.
But after a while, in the larger scheme of things, you realize it's really...<eos> Mr. Bachmann, you structured Bachmanity as a general partnership.<eos> Then, with no money in the bank, you threw a million-dollar luau on Alcatraz.<eos> You're on the hook for that.<eos> And even declaring bankruptcy isn't going to absolve you of these debts.
Yes.<eos> Tuesday, 9:00 a.m.<eos> Pats on the back.<eos> Gentlemen, I just realized I've forgotten to take a shit.<eos> So, uh, I'll see you back at the old homestead.
As you know, since 2011, 14 countries have been collecting the DNA of world leaders in pursuit of creating individualized weapons...<eos> Stop. Talking.<eos> Get as far away from me as you possibly can, and never bring this up again.<eos> There are only two seasons in Washington, lovers of Liberty...<eos> Tax season, a shameful time when your nation's leaders rob you blind for their own amusement and unending sloth...
Pretty soon the bad guys will figure that out.<eos> Hey, Ralph.<eos> I'm gonna turn my camera off now, buddy.<eos> No.<eos> Scorpion will save you.
- Okay.<eos> - I love you...<eos> - Jacob!<eos> Fine!<eos> Leave! I don't need you two anyway.
So Marco lives.<eos> We received word he and Jingim rode together.<eos> And now his father is also gone.<eos> Perhaps the Vice Regent's been discovered.<eos> Or perhaps he's betrayed you.
Mom and I talk.<eos> - We talk to Richard. - Oh, great.<eos> You talk to my guide.<eos> All of these burdens on you guys...<eos> I think it's closing you off from your work. That is absolutely not true.
Did you and Hank find your dad?<eos> We were on our way there until we heard about all this.<eos> - Where are you now?<eos> - At Mom's.<eos> Stay there. If you come to National City, Myriad will take over you too.
- And please wait.<eos> - But we have...<eos> - It's going to be fine.<eos> - ... talk to our kids and...<eos> It's going to be fine, I promise you.
They're from Alderaan.<eos> Another meddling delegation from Alderaan.<eos> I'll handle this personally.<eos> Attention, senatorial convoy.<eos> Your landing has been granted, and fighters will escort you to the Jalath City Depot for processing.
But it still happened.<eos> Tha?<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Nice to see you again, Win.<eos> How appropriate we caught you both at this particular place.
- (We can't sleep out on the streets.)<eos> - There's jobs going, Culverdale railway.<eos> They're building a great bridge out there.<eos> - That's 15 miles.<eos> - I'll find a train that'll take you.
We're not doing owt till our pockets are filled.<eos> What's the use in making matters worse?<eos> - There's no need for this.<eos> - Wages will be here soon enough.<eos> Mr Blackwood won't let you down.
No man lifts a finger!<eos> It's only a day or so before the money comes good, isn't that right?<eos> In the meantime... I'll work with you.<eos> Come back!<eos> I'm ordering you.
If I do this for you, will you promise me that this banishment...<eos> Posting.<eos> This banishment won't start until after our trip to Rhodesia? You know how much we've been looking forward to it.<eos> You're going to deny us that as well?<eos> It's the sensitivity of you two together. The photographers. It would overshadow everything.
Toby, start searching the FBI databases to see if there are any criminals who match this bomb-making signature.<eos> On it.<eos> Tell Captain Jackson I'll send him a report tonight to explain that the glitch was nothing more than a defective fill sensor.<eos> Whatever.<eos> Just get off the base and don't let the gate hit you in the ass on the way out.
You look-- you.<eos> You know, we just came by to see Gloria our old make-up lady.<eos> She left our show because she said that we were too easy to make look good.<eos> Yeah, she came to work here because she loves a big challenge.<eos> Hmm, you know, we haven't seen you two since your marriage so publicly crumbled.
- Right?<eos> - Sure.<eos> Together forever.<eos> I'll be home soon, boys.<eos> I love you too.
She doesn't get hurt.<eos> Ana, we just want you to be happy.<eos> Okay.<eos> We don't like what you're doing, but we love you.<eos> Aw, I love you both.
- They've already raised $1,000.<eos> - That's a sweet gesture.<eos> - He's just trying to build up his muscles to impress the girls.<eos> - Am not!<eos> - Well, I'll leave you in good hands with Dr. Farinas.
He was a shitty bomb-maker.<eos> - Yeah? - Yeah.<eos> He used the wrong type of fertilizer.<eos> The whole thing just fizzled out.<eos> When the Customs agents boarded the plane the next day, he just looked up and said, "I was expecting you.
He said it were on the house.<eos> Much obliged.<eos> The bills will be ready by midday tomorrow and the Glencairn will sail promptly at 2:00.<eos> Each of you 12 leaders must ensure that your men are ready to go.<eos> The Glencairn will take you up the Hudson past our Fort Montgomery to Con Hook, as close to Patriot territory as is safe from their cannon at West Point.
But there shouldn't be any need for them.<eos> No one should be aware of your presence.<eos> Thank you, Mr. Townsend, for the refreshments.<eos> You are welcome, sir.<eos> Lieutenant Gamble will brief you on where each group is to meet their contacts in rebel-held territory.
Okay, bring it in, guy.<eos> Be good.<eos> You know.<eos> Uh, number for the hotel is on the fridge.<eos> If we don't answer right away, it's 'cause we're... getting ice and we'll call you back in around 15 minutes.
Tell me the last still breathing.<eos> That ship is 1.3 nautical miles north-north-west of our position.<eos> Deck officer, full speed ahead. Viriamo and intercept that ship.<eos> Climb on board and find out where are our men.<eos> Fishing boat at 6 kilometers Southeast of Do Son peninsula, Here is the US warship who calls you on channel 1-6. Passage.
Sounds like it's time for the Sheldon Cooper Apology Tour.<eos> Well, I hope it's as much fun as the Sheldon Cooper Spell-Checks Local Menus Tour.<eos> My goodness!<eos> Do you remember "comes with apsparagus"?<eos> Howard and Bernadette, you tried to comfort me when I was ill, and I treated you terribly.
History shows that America must lead, not just with our might, but with our principles.<eos> It shows were are stronger, not when we are alone, but when we bring the world together.<eos> Today's announcement marks one more chapter in this pursuit of a safer and more helpful, more hopeful world.<eos> Thank you.<eos> God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.
Just come in.<eos> So, gents, I really hope you'll be able to join us for our benefit... here tomorrow.<eos> It's gonna be a beautiful, star-studded event.<eos> I think you'll really enjoy it.<eos> And for now, I'm gonna leave you in the capable hands of our new Chief Innovations Officer, Dr. Alexandra Panttiere.
God bless you, and thank you for tuning in.
Oh, so now the deal's back on? Austin:<eos> Drop the knife!<eos> Austin, the police know we're here.<eos> If you kill us, they will catch you.<eos> I'm not gonna kill you.
All we have to do...<eos> Oh, whoa, whoa.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> T-there is no "we." You two are done.<eos> And if I catch either of you working this case, I'll have you both arrested for obstruction.
I am a terminally ill cancer patient. I fully support SB 128, and I beg you to.<eos> Assisting in the taking of a human life is against everything physicians stand for and defiles the reputation and meaning of being a physician.<eos> On behalf of my aunt who was competent and terminally ill and chose to shoot herself to end her suffering, I support this bill.<eos> Just to remind you, you're not gods.<eos> God is watching and God will judge you.
Missing? - Yes.<eos> Since when?<eos> It was on my bed, I just went to the next room.<eos> When I returned, it was missing.<eos> Always lock your room. I've told you so many times.
- Mm-hmm. - When?<eos> - Back in April.<eos> - You got married?<eos> - Yep.<eos> And I would have invited you if you had answered any of my texts.
Return to your homes.<eos> You are in group two.<eos> - If you are not in your homes, - Hurry!<eos> Quick!<eos> the vans will not be able to pick you up
It's our nature.<eos> And I've seen our worst here, but we've also shown our best so let's carry that.<eos> Let's carry that.<eos> Good luck to us all.<eos> And hopefully, I'll see you all very soon.
What was that?<eos> What was what?<eos> Oh, that! It's a cool way to peace out.<eos> Julian taught it to me.<eos> Well, I'm glad the apocalypse is bringing you together.
I'm getting nauseous.<eos> Sorry to interrupt this weirdo love connection... But we're kind of in a hurry.<eos> If we don't do something fast... That asteroid is gonna blow us all to smithereens.<eos> That sounds urgent.<eos> I better take you to him.
I'm Jill Eikland from UBN.<eos> We're running a story on Afterlife within the next 24...<eos> George Hancock suffers from severe psychiatric problems including paranoid delusions.<eos> He's on medical leave.<eos> If you exploit him for ratings, our lawyers will bury you.
District Manager Jeff Sutton wants a meeting.<eos> Okay, yeah.<eos> We'll talk.<eos> Yes!<eos> I knew I could get you.
It's Mateo Fernando Aquino Liwanag on the job.<eos> Not like those sons of bitches outside.<eos> Here, take this.<eos> Please disperse.<eos> I have been authorized to break this strike, and I will hose you.
Then we have to get to the bridge and cut the link before that happens.<eos> How do you suppose that we do that?<eos> - What took you so long?<eos> - This is a big ship.<eos> I didn't know where they put you.
Go get your things.<eos> I'm here to rescue you.<eos> Mercy's already rescued us.<eos> She hasn't rescued you.<eos> She's turned you all into whores.
Like why are you really here?<eos> We just want to go home.<eos> You must think me so naive.<eos> I know you're lying.<eos> I know who really sent you.
Thank you.<eos> Well, I'm gonna get going.<eos> I gotta get up early for church, so, um, have a good night.<eos> - Bye, kids.<eos> - Your old man loves you.
You're kidding, right?<eos> This is a joke? You're taking this on the road?<eos> You are minnows.<eos> Okay? Minnows do not go after sharks for a reason.<eos> They will eat you alive, swallow you whole, spit you out for bait.
And who knows?<eos> She could be up and walking again this time next year.<eos> You never know.<eos> Don't give up hope, right?<eos> God bless you, Dr. Riggs.
You know what?<eos> I'm gonna use you as my weights.<eos> - Don't worry, Gemma. I'll use you in my next set.<eos> - Whee! Shit, you are heavy.<eos> * Happy birthday to you *
I'm gonna use you as my weights.<eos> - Don't worry, Gemma. I'll use you in my next set.<eos> - Whee! Shit, you are heavy.<eos> * Happy birthday to you *<eos> * Happy birthday to you *
- Whee! Shit, you are heavy.<eos> * Happy birthday to you *<eos> * Happy birthday to you *<eos> * Happy birthday, dear Sherrie *<eos> * Happy birthday to you *
It is ours now.<eos> Evening to you, sirs.<eos> Madame.<eos> Thatcher, I always knew you were the one with the brains.<eos> Cadogan's dental supplies, ain't none of you in need of falsies, last time I saw you.
Is this a blonde chick?<eos> I...<eos> I don't know.<eos> I-I never met her.<eos> Then how'd she hire you?
Um, thanks for having my back.<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> Listen...<eos> I know what it's like to be the smartest guy in the room and I also know it's a waste of time trying to prove it.<eos> Let your work speak for itself and be open to the possibility that people that don't understand you, they're not necessarily trying to get in your way.
Still no answer.<eos> Monroe? Are you freaking kidding me?<eos> What is it?<eos> They're back again.<eos> Same truck. What do you think we can't see you?
We're not gonna sell right now.<eos> We're gonna hold out.<eos> Are you serious? I...<eos> When were you plannin' on tellin' us?<eos> To be honest... If I'm not looking right at you, I try to forget you're here.
We have a humane animal policy thanks to our Chief Innovations Officer, Dr. Panttiere.<eos> She's going through every department in St. Matthew's.<eos> Oh, she's been pretty incredible, actually.<eos> Finding ways to use them we never even imagined possible.<eos> Doctors Harrison and Panttiere, I'll see you both in my office when you have finished.
That watch I gave you, it didn't fall off the back of a truck.<eos> Your boyfriend and I robbed a jeweler's.<eos> Isn't that right, S√©lim?<eos> Didn't you tell her?<eos> I'd better leave you to it.
You two should meet Nicholas Shore.<eos> - He's got some fascinating notions - _<eos> - about judicial restraint.<eos> - _<eos> I will join you in a moment.
Take them now.<eos> Not today, boys.<eos> Connor.<eos> Gustus!<eos> Augustus will hunt you down and grind you for glue.
Are you willing to do anything to stop the Romans?<eos> Yes.<eos> To die?<eos> Yes.<eos> Then I will train you both. For once we start down this road, there is no coming back.
Do we have an accord?<eos> Mr. Tyler. See?<eos> Rex Tyler.<eos> Told you we knew the guy.<eos> I don't know you.
It was to get my hands on this and enhance it, but not for them.<eos> I'm not only a man in a metal suit.<eos> At least not after this.<eos> We are under attack.<eos> Baron Krieger has ordered us to transport you to a more secure location.
- We've had a lot of...<eos> - Radioactive metas.<eos> Yes, thank you, Allen.<eos> I've read all the case studies.<eos> I'll tell you what, when I figure it out, I'll enlighten you then, shall I?
I... I solved the derivative you done beamed up.<eos> My name is Wells, Harrison Wells.<eos> You can call me Hell's Wells.<eos> They call me that 'cause of my past.<eos> I won't get into it with you now right and proper.
'Cause you've got Iris.<eos> You got your happy ending.<eos> Everyone else be damned.<eos> So, I'll tell you what:<eos> you guys let me go, and I will leave you to your sad and miserable lives.
Now, this, Dr. Baker, is what I need your expertise with.<eos> Certainly.<eos> Oh, you see these grooves. They indicate it was a wheel-made lamp versus the mold-based ones that became so popular in the '40s...<eos> Uh, fascinating, Doctor, but can you skip ahead to the part where King Solomon seals a genie inside of it?<eos> Ah. Did Sidney put you up to this?
You're a woman.<eos> You'll understand this.<eos> My daughter is all I had.<eos> He took her from me.<eos> So until somebody makes it worth my while, I will haunt you.
And when she called and said that you two were sticking your noses into something dangerous and needed a babysitter, I said okay.<eos> Did she tell you about LokSat, how it's connected...<eos> Okay, just stop right there.<eos> Now, whatever this is and whoever you have obviously pissed off, the less I know about this, the better my chances are of staying alive.<eos> Remember, I'm just a babysitter, so I'll change your diapers and feed you your bottle and... save you from a strike force of armed mercenaries, but I am not joining your fight.
So they handpicked us from all the other rats out there and just let us nibble away at his royal majesty's precious power.<eos> But as soon as this war's all over it's back to the sewers for all of us.<eos> That means you too, hero.<eos> You missing home so much, Libertus, why don't you and Nyx head on back?<eos> I'm sure Niflheim will welcome you with open arms.
For you, I'll make some.<eos> What can you hope to do?<eos> One man against an empire.<eos> Against the daemons.<eos> How will you save Insomnia with no wall to protect you?
Me too.<eos> Thank you, Libertus.<eos> Hey, queen!<eos> You and the king are always welcome in Galahd.<eos> Me and Nyx will be waiting for you.
I have to admit, I've been worried about the military applications since we started talking about this.<eos> Me, too.<eos> Why didn't you say something?<eos> Same reason I don't talk about ass cancer, it's not a pleasant topic.<eos> Hey, you can't let this stop you.
- Great, thank you so much. - Uh-huh.<eos> Snakey the snake?<eos> I don't know what you name a snake, okay?<eos> You are pretty adorable when you're under pressure.<eos> Okay, try to control yourselves until I do this, then I'll leave you alone.
I'm here now.<eos> Ashley... are you okay?<eos> It's not mine.<eos> They killed Grandpa.<eos> Kara's gonna take you.
I have one more card to play.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll just be here if you need me.<eos> Trogowogs, listen to me.<eos> The criminal Bane has altered your minds to use you for his own evil ends.
It was me you were meant to meet.<eos> She already knew we were coming.<eos> Maybe she's the one who's going help us?<eos> Ask her... how is she going to help us?<eos> I am going to help you... by giving you these knives.
We'll take measure after checking the security footage.<eos> You said he hit you with an umbrella?<eos> But you said it was a metal pipe striking the door?<eos> It might be a random incident.<eos> Or it was someone stalking you.
It worked.<eos> Apologize.<eos> I will do you one better.<eos> I'm gonna go downstairs and get my heckle file.<eos> And after I put you all in your place, once and for all, I'll be free to get to work, sans distractions.
Take it.<eos> Take it.<eos> Tell them this is for Pablo.<eos> Remember what you saw.<eos> And know what will happen to you if I see you on a rooftop.
-Where are you taking us?<eos> -Bogot√°.<eos> You're going to jail until this gets resolved.<eos> But look... if you help me, I can help you.<eos> Give me Pablo, or Blackie or someone else, then I'll help you.
How are our children?<eos> My love, we're all okay.<eos> We need you.<eos> And I need you.<eos> Listen, I'm going to get you out of there soon.
Oh, come on, man.<eos> I don't want Julie and Mary to get hurt. - Good.<eos> - So now that we've heard each other, what next?<eos> I figure it out:<eos> how you set me up, who else is involved, and then I bring you all down.
Okay, so you made him try out, then you cut him.<eos> Ouch, Coach.<eos> Back when tryouts was over when we played, how'd you get us to come together?<eos> How'd you get us to start being a team?<eos> Took you up to Heritage Falls.
I'm still not right.<eos> He's got to be a huge letdown after me, right?<eos> I got to be honest.<eos> Neither of you knocked it out of the park.<eos> Okay, I think what your father means is we love you both.
Oh, my God.<eos> These are the ones that killed Jake?<eos> They don't look like professional hires.<eos> Ken, is that a new guy?<eos> Who sent you?
He's gonna have the answers.<eos> I've been waiting for you two for a long time.<eos> What is going on?<eos> Who are you guys?<eos> Did Patrick Spring hire you?
"You were like my sister.<eos> "I love you, Chlo√©,<eos> "even if you don't return my love.<eos> "Goodbye.<eos> "Marion who's gone, but hasn't forgotten you."
On it.<eos> What happened?<eos> Errol Flynn is not backing down.<eos> Where are you taking us?<eos> I told Regina I'd take you somewhere safe.
My kids started developing rashes. And we didn't know... understand, like, what was going on.<eos> We noticed that he started complaining of headaches, giving us a hard time eating.<eos> My son will be five in March. He weighs 36 lbs.<eos> His twin is 53.<eos> How do you sit by watching the people who put you in office, showing you rashes all over their body, hair loss... your constituents bringing in all this discolored water, begging you for help, and how do you say you didn't know? I...
It would mean the world to him.<eos> Well, when you put it that way, what choice do we possibly have but to say... no, it's still a no.<eos> Wha-what-what! Da-da-dub-dub-dub-DJ Glitterbuns!<eos> If y'all are ra-rup-rup-ready to get funky! Make some noise!<eos> -[crowd cheering loudly] -[upbeat music playing] I can't hear you!
It feels good, it's wool.<eos> -Stop, Mort, I don't need your hat!<eos> -[Mort screams] My fellow kingdoms, I owe you an apology.<eos> Please, take a knee.<eos> I invited you all to unite. [grunts]
How is your... your injury?<eos> It hurts more than I can say.<eos> Although when it comes time to tell the jury, I'll find the words.<eos> We're prepared to offer you one million dollars today to drop the lawsuit.<eos> See you in court.
The director saved us from the brink of extinction and created the grand plan, we have to trust that.<eos> - Is that what you believe?<eos> All of you?<eos> I wish I could.<eos> But then again, the director didn't send any of you back into the body of a young man addicted to heroin.
What the hell is that?<eos> Someone's on the property.<eos> Perimeter breach.<eos> - Assassins?<eos> - The faction probably followed you here.
Trang Dinh?<eos> 64th Special?<eos> How do you know that?<eos> We already met you today, sir.<eos> I've never seen you.
Let me see it!<eos> You may see it, But I'm afraid your rank isn't high enough.<eos> It's very... very confidential.<eos> If you insist, I'll show it to you.<eos> I'm going to show you now.
Join us.<eos> Join us.<eos> Brothers and sisters we build a world in her image.<eos> You need not be sick, hungry, tired.<eos> The Brotherhood will clothe you, feed you, shelter you.
- No, no, no, please.<eos> - We're not even near the...<eos> Hey, guys, what's going on?<eos> That party was lame, so I bailed.<eos> Then I saw you, so I followed you here.
You're just an apologist for Krusty.<eos> I am not a paid apologist for Krusty!<eos> I didn't say "paid."<eos> Got to go.<eos> I'll see you in the future.
- Eleanor- yeah, I know, you want to do that thing where we're arguing and fighting, but then suddenly it's like,<eos> "whoa, this is hot," and we start making out.<eos> Dream on!<eos> - So how much of that did you hear?<eos> - We couldn't hear you, but I'm an expert in non-verbal communication, and it is clear-- you are in conflict.
I was not for the bill that he was talking about because it was not tough enough on the criminal.<eos> [Stevenson] In an environment where everybody's doing the same thing, everybody's competing to be tough on crime, you quickly all end up in the same space, so it doesn't become a political advantage unless you do something more.<eos> We need more police on the street.<eos> There is a crime bill which would put more police on the street, which was killed for this session by a filibuster in the Senate, mostly by Republican senators.<eos> We'd consistently had, "Squishy, soft liberal won't protect you.
Darn!<eos> How dare you defy me.<eos> - In your face!<eos> - Laugh while you can.<eos> My next monster will eradicate you!
Inazagi?<eos> I... I can't remember.<eos> Let me give you a refresher.<eos> One of our people saw you go into the bathroom with Ben Larson.<eos> Did someone from Inazagi follow you there?
So you're a doctor?<eos> No.<eos> She's not a doctor.<eos> But it's very important work.<eos> Anyway, Daddy's gonna be taking you to school, picking you up, watching you until I get home, stuff like that.
No, he also calculated that I'd make it.<eos> Do you like wasting your money on nonsense?<eos> I like nonsense.<eos> - Here you go.<eos> - God bless you, young man.
Just end it.<eos> - What?<eos> The job of being a parent! Just end it.<eos> You keep going on and on about how tough it is. So, just end it.<eos> Who has forced you to continue being parents?
- What?<eos> The job of being a parent! Just end it.<eos> You keep going on and on about how tough it is. So, just end it.<eos> Who has forced you to continue being parents?<eos> Has anyone forced you to?
Who has forced you to continue being parents?<eos> Has anyone forced you to?<eos> You didn't start the job well in the first place. And now, I don't understand.. Why continue it?<eos> Just end it. Put an end to it!<eos> When kids need you the most, you happily leave them and go.
He said if I came forward, that... that I would never see her again.<eos> Well, you didn't go to the police.<eos> We came to you.<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> There's nothing that I could say that will help you.
Just... mildly concerned is all.<eos> Shut up and pour me a drink.<eos> Good evening.<eos> Thank you all for, uh, staying so late tonight.<eos> I know we've called you in a few times today.
You heard the Captain, stay close.<eos> Do you really believe everything the old man says?<eos> You should listen to him.<eos> You might learn something.<eos> I think the pressure's getting to all of you.
Liam.<eos> How's Liam?<eos> Is he okay?<eos> Aye, lad.<eos> He is now. I feel like I'm still missing a huge part of the story here. Your kid brother has a submarine, and he kidnapped you.
== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man I had a bad dream that my best friend became a tyrant and forced me to stay up all night to work.<eos> Oh, I had a good dream that when I carried you to bed, I let your head hit the wall and I laughed.<eos> Good morning.<eos> What is this?<eos> Well, we didn't see you last night, we're not gonna see you today, so we thought we could have breakfast together.
Wait, Gran, is that you?<eos> No. Gran is dead.<eos> I'm her stuff.<eos> You ignored Gran in life.<eos> Now her stuff will haunt you in death!
Ha! Like that's gonna work.<eos> [all chanting] Nah-nah, we can't hear you.<eos> Nah-nah, we can't hear you.<eos> - Nah-nah, we can't hear you.<eos> - Cut it out. I'm supposed to be the one annoying you.
She's got me.<eos> Leave me, foul spirit!<eos> [muffled groans] [growly voice] Gran just wants you idiots to pay attention to her.<eos> This cave's beyond saving.<eos> Get out before she drives you mad!
One problem at a time.<eos> You know what?<eos> It's not happening.<eos> We need a real plan.<eos> Well, I invite you to offer one up.
I am besieged by 1,000 or more Mexicans under Santa Anna.<eos> I have sustained a continual bombardment and cannonade for 24 hours, and have not lost a man.<eos> Hee-ya!<eos> I shall never surrender or retreat.<eos> Then I call on you in the name of liberty, of patriotism, and everything dear to the American character to come to our aid with all dispatch.
It's too late!<eos> This metal box is on U.S. soil, and it's overflowing with evidence incriminating you.<eos> So, let our pals go, I toss this puppy over, and we all go back to hacking and spying on each other forever.<eos> Or I could take this to the World Court.<eos> If history's any indication, your country will throw you under the bus in a heartbeat to save face.
We still have some time.<eos> True.<eos> Read a book, pick a flower, rage, rage against the dying of the light.<eos> Just do it quickly.<eos> I'll see you at the cemetery soon enough.
Yeah, that felt--<eos> I didn't feel anything that time.<eos> Let's try this again.<eos> Yeah. Yeah.<eos> Ninjas, I'm about to light you up like Christmas trees!
-and it 100% hurt.<eos> -And it was 100% hilarious.<eos> Okay, time for us to average all our criteria and come up with the final list.<eos> In our quest to find technology that gives mere mortals superpowers, we've tested everything from controlling lightning...<eos> Ninjas, I'm about to light you up like Christmas trees.
I don't see the problem. She teaches well.<eos> Hey, don't complain too much.<eos> You'll learn a lot from Coralina.<eos> Is she unfriendly?<eos> Think that she prepares you for the future.
I am telling you, about 200 air raids a day, and the new rockets are not like the old ones.<eos> Two hundred air raids a day?<eos> And every rocket is ruining a full neighborhood.<eos> "You, White Helmets, you are heroes.<eos> May God protect you."
I guess that means another glass of wine.<eos> Looks that way.<eos> This is crazy. We don't even have cable yet, and already we've got two new besties.<eos> Yeah. Cable's great, huh?<eos> By the way, when you get it, we'll understand if we don't see you for a while.
Fine.<eos> Help him if you have to.<eos> But promise me you're not gonna hurt yourself in the process.<eos> I promise.<eos> Harbor Patrol and Customs will meet you on site.
You spent some time in England?<eos> My parents sent me abroad during the Russian occupation.<eos> Mrs. Durrani.<eos> Homeland Security, the FBI, and the Joint Terrorism Task Force are on their way to speak with you.<eos> In the meantime, we have some questions about the men who smuggled you into the country.
Let's go.<eos> Where?<eos> To get the medicine back.<eos> And then?<eos> Take you and it back to Murphy.
I want your knighting ceremony to be perfect.<eos> You're going to be the noblest knight the kingdom has ever seen.<eos> Is that for me?<eos> For tomorrow?<eos> My name is Sir Henry, Knight of the Realm. And I shall defend all of you.
I know.<eos> I know.<eos> That's what I'm counting on.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> She's not going to hurt you.
I'm sorry for my tardiness, my dear chosen ones.<eos> Please, come closer.<eos> You are here for the Purification ritual.<eos> Purification serves to cleanse you of a great evil of society.<eos> The vaccine will sterilize you.
Oh, I'm not a hero, but I'm glad everything worked out.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> Well, I guess a stopped clock can be right twice a day, eh?<eos> Take the high road, Walter.<eos> You know, I will take the high road, because you two will have to live the rest of your lives knowing that the kid that you used to torment saved you.
Any light can hurt it if we could just figure out a way to trap it somehow.<eos> Yeah, sounds great, but we don't even know where this thing is.<eos> How are we supposed to trap it?<eos> I'm not sure yet.<eos> The light-- It's here... and it's going to kill you.
Funny?<eos> Yeah, like those dudes from CHiPs.<eos> The TV show from the '70s about the CHP... 1977 to 1983, to be exact.<eos> I'll forget more about chips while I'm sleeping than you'll ever know in your whole life.<eos> Can I help you two?
They're very honest, but I would not leave cash lying around.<eos> Sheldon, what do you think you're doing?<eos> My room is paid up until the end of the month, so I can do with it whatever I please, which includes renting it out for a dollar a night.<eos> It's like the '40s again.<eos> Anyway, I'll leave you be.
The teeth tear and chew, grinding the food into paste before it's swallowed.<eos> Then, it travels down the wind pipe...<eos> I mean, esophagus.<eos> So the reason you were late and covered in dirt was because you were fighting a "mud monster"?<eos> While there was some gnarly troll watching you? Talk about creepy.
Are you ready, young wards, to embark with me on the greatest adventure?<eos> Oh, yeah!<eos> Where? Where?<eos> The adventure of reading!<eos> Hours upon hours of research awaits you.
-I have.<eos> I had a cheese katsu bento.<eos> Ramen! Ramen!<eos> Let's really go.<eos> Sure, I'll take you to a great place.
I'm hungry.<eos> I'm thirsty.<eos> Why did you run away, you bastard?<eos> Sit down.<eos> Forgive him, I beg you.
All of it!<eos> Let's do ..<eos> So, you're going to bite us too?<eos> Come on!<eos> Try me, motherfucker. I will kill you.
Did you get the tablet art for the Happy Vegan Cookbook?<eos> Uh, yeah, I'll forward it to you.<eos> Thanks.<eos> So are we just not gonna talk about Bjornberg?<eos> I saw you guys last night at the party. Oh. And Diana almost saw you too.
Mom, the White House here to see me.<eos> We need you to vote for the bill.<eos> More importantly, the president needs you to vote for the bill.<eos> The president?<eos> The president sent you here to talk to me?
I mean, look, if you're gonna build it like that...<eos> - Richard, no.<eos> - Richard.<eos> Ugh... Hey, pen down, Dumbledorf.<eos> Suffice to say... there is something somewhere on this board... that is gonna strangle you at scale.
Yeah.<eos> Fucking lawyers, man. Right?<eos> Like it or not, Richie, you're stuck with Hanneman.<eos> I mean, technically, it's not even a merger.<eos> EndFrame just absorbs you, and you're gone.
Athelstan, you should bless this house.<eos> Ask God to bless its new occupants.<eos> Let us pray.<eos> In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, amen.<eos> I am thy Lord, thy God, which have brought you out of the land of Egypt.
In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, amen.<eos> I am thy Lord, thy God, which have brought you out of the land of Egypt.<eos> Out of the house of bondage, thou shalt...<eos> **<eos> Earl Ingstad has left you to farm in England.
It makes no difference to me.<eos> I am dying.<eos> But at least I know, I will see Athelstan again.<eos> What did I tell you, Rollo?<eos> I warned all of you.
A desire to visit revenge upon those men that put her through that ordeal.<eos> It would seem only reasonable, then, that I bear an equal measure of gratitude to the man who rescued her from it.<eos> Were it not for that gratitude, you and I would not be speaking like this.<eos> You and Colonel Rhett would be having a very different conversation.<eos> Because while I knew you once, called you friends once, I cannot fathom how those people I knew turned into you.
Where's Aunt Claire?<eos> Okay. Those of you in the front of the train Should be able to see our main gates.<eos> Please obey all park rules.<eos> Proper attire, including shoes and shirts, must be worn at all times.<eos> Your aunt arranged to greet you at 1:00.
- Three, four years ago?<eos> - Uh, Seven.<eos> Seven years, but, you know, close.<eos> So, I see you already got your wristbands. And this is for food.<eos> And Zara here is going to take great care of you until I'm done working tonight, okay?
And Zara here is going to take great care of you until I'm done working tonight, okay?<eos> You're not coming with us?<eos> I really wish that I could, but tomorrow I can take you into the control room, show you behind the scenes and all of that.<eos> That's gonna be cool, right?<eos> Okay, so I will see you tonight at 6:00.
Hey, there.<eos> I'm Jimmy Fallon.<eos> Welcome aboard the Gyrosphere, an amazing machine made possible by science.<eos> Your safety is our main concern.<eos> Which is why you're behind our invisible barrier system, which protects you from things like Dilophosaurus venom.
I'm Jimmy Fallon.<eos> Welcome aboard the Gyrosphere, an amazing machine made possible by science.<eos> Your safety is our main concern.<eos> Which is why you're behind our invisible barrier system, which protects you from things like Dilophosaurus venom.<eos> One drop of this can paralyze you, so watch out.
Is this real?<eos> It is?<eos> And for added protection, each vehicle is surrounded by aluminum oxynitride glass.<eos> So tough, it can stop a .50-caliber bullet.<eos> The Gyroscopic technology will keep you upright at all times...
There's no service here, anyways.<eos> Lt's got all my music.<eos> But if you think of it as part of a larger process, then it just might.<eos> Jack:<eos> You've come here to destroy the impulses that got you here.
The koala, remember?<eos> He saved you from the quicksand, twice.<eos> Oh, Bill Koala!<eos> Emus, big hearts, tiny brains.<eos> Don't worry, they'll get you there.
What are you doing?<eos> I wish to speak on behalf of the defendant.<eos> You have not been recognized.<eos> Sit back and you'll...<eos> These men convinced you that they speak for you.
What a lot of people aren't aware of is that the terms "heterosexual" and "homosexual" were only introduced about a hundred years ago.<eos> Asmymother usedtoalwayssay ,<eos> "whenyouhelpothers, you'rehelpingyourself aswell." We often read about more sexually...<eos> Mygoalis to threadaneedle throughthefabric ofthiscountry andstitchtogetherthe lives ofgaykidseverywhere.<eos> I know a lot of you are balancing religion and sexuality, but I mean, come on, what god would punish you for finding love?
Yep, coming.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Nicola, is there anything I can do?<eos> You could book her in.<eos> Yeah, yeah, I'll leave you to it.
Colette picked them out for you herself.<eos> "Daniel."<eos> Come on in, boys!<eos> It's just fashion.<eos> It's not gonna kill you.
Something crazy is happening.<eos> Vincent fired me.<eos> I have no idea what's going on.<eos> Oh, wow. You know, that's really too bad, 'cause we've got a flight to catch, so we got to go. Okay.<eos> Okay. I'll take you to the airport.
I should have checked the grounds for any rogue hives.<eos> I believed the pollen was sterile, but obviously I was wrong.<eos> I understand.<eos> And I forgive you.<eos> I know how difficult it is for you to see the scope of what we're doing here, but that's why I need the three of you.
Pablo is really pissed off.<eos> Shut that mug, or you will never reach 66, you hear?<eos> [men chattering in Spanish] [speaking English] I'm calling this off. Nobody's coming. - What the fuck has happened here?<eos> - Maybe Poison spotted the spotter.<eos> Either that or Su√°rez sold you out.
Roscoe's chicken and waffles grand opening.<eos> Charlie, please, don't help me.<eos> All right.<eos> So, you mean to tell me that one day a year... It's a white party up in here?<eos> Well... * Yeah * * one, two princes kneel before you * * that's what I said, now * Look, Dre, I hear you loud and clear, so we'll see you guys on Monday.
No, I can't imagine they let him go, I'm sure he must've escaped, right?<eos> I don't like loony bins.<eos> This is giving me a really bad feeling.<eos> - Yeah. - It's understandable, Frank, but these places, they're a necessary evil.<eos> I'm telling you, you got to trust the system;
Oh, it's so good to see you guys again.<eos> It's like a breath of fresh air.<eos> (Groans) - Nothing fresh about it. - Mm-mm.<eos> Oh, come on. Whoo!<eos> This was such an amazing summer, but I missed you so... (Phone ringing)
I don't care what the baby's name is.<eos> It's just my job to determine whether or not he can live here.<eos> What the fuck does that suppose to mean?<eos> Good thing I knew where you guys lived.<eos> Otherwise Karen would've never been able to find you.
No, I think he's done.<eos> Hey, guys, Baby Goya wants to meet you.<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> Okay, wait a minute.<eos> Oh, good, she found you.
I mean that you should stay.<eos> You should--<eos> You should come home like you wanted to.<eos> Oh, man...<eos> I can't keep up with you people.
Okay, guys.<eos> So...<eos> Getting ready to go in the water.<eos> Spit it right in the visor.<eos> No one's watching, no one's judging you.
Yeah I speak English.<eos> Are you the new neighbor?<eos> Yes, I just moved in.<eos> Cool.<eos> Yeah, yeah, So I guess, see you around.
Did he--? Why did he stop? Did he see--?<eos> Did he see you?<eos> ls that why--?<eos> Is that why they stopped struggling?<eos> He saw you?
Is that why they stopped struggling?<eos> He saw you?<eos> Is that what happened?<eos> Come on. Come on.<eos> Did he see you?
How well do you know him?<eos> The mission, what do you know about it?<eos> Ever hear of Hitler's wonder weapons?<eos> I think the Colonel will send us across enemy lines for one of those.<eos> We're counting on you to lead...
All I can say is we're going behind enemy lines.<eos> You think we're ready, sir?<eos> I know you're ready.<eos> Are you ready?<eos> Sergeant, if something should happen to me or any of us while we are over there, some of these men might look to you for leadership...
‚ô™ He met a fair maiden ‚ô™ One bright May morning ‚ô™ As he went a-hunting<eos> ‚ô™ Pale was the skin ‚ô™ Of the Midsomer maiden<eos> ‚ô™ Blue eyes ‚ô™ As blue as the sea ‚ô™ And on her fair head<eos> ‚ô™ Young men, don't stray<eos> ‚ô™ This maiden will lead you away...
I have had the perfect life.<eos> I have had the perfect marriage...<eos> [Giggles]<eos> - The perfect children, and the perfect grandchildren and great-grandchildren!<eos> And I just want you to know how much I love you.
I'm... going to go upstairs.<eos> I'm going to put on some music...<eos> You wait till you hear the music.<eos> 'Good morning, Pagford.<eos> 'I know I've kept you waiting, but today's the day.' ON STEREO: The Deadwood Stage (Whip-Crack-Away) by Doris Day
No. No. Sorry, Ron.<eos> Doors are locked.<eos> We've taken your keycards and your phones and the automatic timer won't go off until tomorrow at 8:00 a.m.<eos> You're trapped in there.<eos> We told security not to disturb you under any circumstances.
Khaleesi is marrying Jack Sparrow.<eos> Oh, God, that show has really gone off the rails.<eos> Look, it makes sense if you've read the books.<eos> Look, our baby monitor is on the table.<eos> If you guys can talk this out and settle your differences like grown-ups, turn it on and I will come to get you from my office.
Oh, you guys should've corner-boothed it.<eos> - 'Cause you look awful.<eos> - Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. You're gonna scare off the other customers. - Shh.<eos> - Hey, Jen.<eos> All those kids keep you up all night?
- What do you say, Bubbs? - [heavy sigh]<eos> - Come on, buddy.<eos> - Fuck's sakes!<eos> - I'll loan you the goddamn money... - Yeah!<eos> ...only because I love you guys, but I don't trust either of you as far as I can fucking throw you.
You wanna know?<eos> Let me ask!<eos> Hold on...<eos> Hey officers!<eos> Mom's inviting you for a meal.
Also, I need a briefing on how our surveillance failed so badly.<eos> Okay, so, Jim Norton was here this morning.<eos> He was parked three full miles away from your crime scene, casing the next house he intends to rob, and where we intended to arrest him.<eos> Maybe Norton's the wrong guy.<eos> Or maybe he figured out that you were following, and maybe led you in the opposite direction.
Yeah, this town, man ... crazy, crazy.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You're telling me.<eos> You guys new around here?<eos> I've never seen you before.
It won't take long.<eos> Is this really necessary?<eos> How are we supposed to use the head?<eos> This is not what we agreed to.<eos> I said I'd move you.
"Servers will not eat anywhere other than the break room."<eos> Let's hope that one sinks in. Hmm?<eos> It pains me to admit it, but I couldn't wait to buy the place just so I could see the look on Larry's face when I fired him.<eos> Just let me know if you need anything else, okay?<eos> You guys just have a seat wherever. I'll be right with you.
How does it feel?<eos> Like home.<eos> Colonel Baird, the graduation gifts, I believe, are on your desk.<eos> So, what? You're kicking us out?<eos> No, I'm pushing you out... of the nest.
Our branch is here to check yours.<eos> If we didn't feel America Works warranted taxpayer money,<eos> - then it's not fit to be law.<eos> - Now, look.<eos> This is the first time that the leaders of both parties have met with me in one room, and not because I didn't invite you, because you declined.
All right.<eos> I'll call the C.O.<eos> Wait here.<eos> You can go in.<eos> The General will meet you there.
Yeah.<eos> You and me both.<eos> Could be worse.<eos> Could be zombies.<eos> I'll take you to the General.
Let's move it, people!<eos> We gotta get them in the air now!<eos> Independence, Control.<eos> We have to get you in the air now.<eos> You won't be able to launch if the wall reaches you.
Yeah, what are the odds Gallagher goes into traction by the end of the day?<eos> Better odds than you looking down and ever seeing your dick again.<eos> Hey, since when are you back to working for Skinny Mike?<eos> Since the cops decided to make the streets safe for strollers and yoga mats again,<eos> - fuck you very much.
And he says it wasn't personal.<eos> Lord Loxley, we're at a business meeting.<eos> Sit down, sir.<eos> Gentlemen, just remember what's at stake.<eos> What's at stake is that Lord Loxley has been manipulating all of you for his own ends.
Hey, come on in.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Everybody, you remember Anna and Otis.<eos> - From racquetball, right?<eos> - Who the fuck invited you?
And they have no idea why.<eos> All they know is, this is what happens when you go after the thing you want the most.<eos> Something someone else says you can't have... and they never question it, it's just what they do.<eos> So my question is, are you gonna go after your banana?<eos> Or are you gonna let all the other chimps knock you down?
Please Stop!<eos> Stay With Me.<eos> You'Re Crazy!<eos> You'Re Crazy.<eos> I Wasn'T Expecting You So Soon.
But will he have a prominent position?<eos> Opal, not the time.<eos> You deserve an answer, Algernon.<eos> Oh, I think our carriage is here.<eos> I'm sure he'll wait for you.
I want to help the King, not hurt him.<eos> You?<eos> How would you help our king?<eos> Just let me borrow the tunic and I promise to come back and tell you everything.<eos> That's no way to greet the warriors who protect you.
There are forces... opposing us.<eos> Warleggan forces?<eos> With what aim?<eos> To put us out of business.<eos> Well, if Tresidder won't have you, where will you go?
You come in here and you make demands?<eos> ! These are outsiders, not my people.<eos> Then give us the outsiders!<eos> I have business with them!<eos> Now put down your weapons and leave here... or I will burn you to ash!
They let you in the club?<eos> I'm not of the tribe, if that's what you mean.<eos> I like my summers on the beach, thank you very much.<eos> I sure as shit know your ways.<eos> I know you two, now I've seen you in action.
That's your favorite.<eos> Right, Darling? You like that watermelon flavor, don't you?<eos> We'll get it next time.<eos> Does that mean that we... No worries. No worries.<eos> Now, I assume whoever told you about the star leaf, clued you into the code of conduct?
WOMAN: Visiting hours are until 3.<eos> You're allowed to travel within the perimeter of the hospital.<eos> It's recommended that conversations stay light and upbeat.<eos> Please wear these at all times in a visible location.<eos> Through the security gate, a guard on the other side will escort you to the rec room.
Martians, too, by the look of your ship.<eos> We are nothing like you.<eos> The only things Earthers care about is government handouts.<eos> Free food, free water, free drugs so that you can forget the aimless lives you lead.<eos> You're short-sighted and selfish, and it will destroy you.
~ You're not half the man Walter is!<eos> ~ Gemma, please.<eos> Never come anywhere near me ever again... ~ Gem, please.<eos> No, no, no... ~ .. in your pathetic little life!<eos> So this bloke you think is called Alan Salt saw you, you think... Stopped walking towards the brothel, smoked a cigarette, and then pretended to walk into the house next to the knocking shop...
Never come anywhere near me ever again... ~ Gem, please.<eos> No, no, no... ~ .. in your pathetic little life!<eos> So this bloke you think is called Alan Salt saw you, you think... Stopped walking towards the brothel, smoked a cigarette, and then pretended to walk into the house next to the knocking shop...<eos> You think?<eos> How come he saw you?
I'm not.<eos> Please. We don't have much time.<eos> We need a way to get our people out of this mountain without killing everyone.<eos> He's not gonna help us.<eos> You cut the power, risking the lives of everyone in this mountain... my people, even the ones who helped you.
That we will become that shining city on a hill.<eos> My friends, I believe that you and I together can keep this rendezvous with destiny.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> Everyone, thank you.
All right.<eos> Okay, ladies, we are entering the unplugged portion of the journey.<eos> Kindly place all cell phones, iPods, iPads, androids, et cetera, in the box.<eos> I just got to send one last text.<eos> "Dear entire JV football team, I'm gonna miss you so much."
Yes, don't you see?<eos> If Coriolanus has to audition for the same humiliating roles as I do, then that part he stole from me wasn't the big break that I thought it was.<eos> Which means your big break still hasn't happened yet.<eos> I'm so happy for you.<eos> I love you both so much, even though I don't always say it.
They've got themselves two seats on the today's flight.<eos> Yes, they're leaving for the airport just now.<eos> The Colonia Dignidad is very powerful here in Chile.<eos> They're probably already at the airport to make sure you won't leave the country.<eos> I will personally take you there.
Why don't you come on in?<eos> I'd love to show you some hybrid hospitality.<eos> I only wanted to see the little one who has been promised to me.<eos> Won't be long now.<eos> Surely you've noticed the spell protecting you is growing weaker.
We're responsible for building security, not something like...<eos> Do I look like a complete fucking idiot to you?<eos> No, sir.<eos> Well, I must look like one because you seem to think I don't have the faintest fucking idea who I'm talking to here.<eos> Most of you were recruited out of black ops to be Pryce's personal, highly paid mischief and mayhem crew.
Fishing with Brick.<eos> Well, I'm in, too.<eos> Uh, I didn't invite...<eos> That sounds like the most fun ever.<eos> Look, I have known you both for years.
Not that I mind, of course.<eos> No, I'm quite happy here with Terrance.<eos> Terrance?<eos> Nobody is to touch anything in this room until I give the word.<eos> You're all to return home and remain there until I send for you.
I was hoping to reach out to whoever Archie was trying to help because they must be carrying a terrible burden.<eos> I must be mistaken.<eos> Silly me.<eos> I'm always wading out of my depth.<eos> I won't trouble you any longer.
These assholes must have known we were onto them.<eos> All right.<eos> Shouldn't take us more than a couple of hours to get to the Bahamas.<eos> Nice.<eos> Paulo will meet you two in Nassau.
All right.<eos> Shouldn't take us more than a couple of hours to get to the Bahamas.<eos> Nice.<eos> Paulo will meet you two in Nassau.<eos> He'll get you spending money, set you up, make sure you're comfortable.
Shut the door, please.<eos> - Viktor.<eos> - We know it was your men.<eos> What was?<eos> Did you think we wouldn't detect you?
That mean you're taking us home?<eos> A home of sorts.<eos> Sadly, there wouldn't be much left of wherever you came from.<eos> But we do have a place for you.<eos> A refuge, outside the Scorch, where WICKED will never find you again.
Really?<eos> Some guys have all the luck.<eos> Good evening, gentlemen.<eos> You all know how this works.<eos> If you hear your name called... please rise in an orderly fashion, join my colleagues behind me... where they will escort you to the eastern wing.
This is short 200.<eos> I told you about this.<eos> What do I tell Mr. Frank?<eos> He can buy beer, he can pay the rent.<eos> Tell him to have it tomorrow or I'll put you on an ICE bus.
Ladies and gentlemen, due to a sudden safety issue, we need to request that you cash out your chips and vacate the premises.<eos> These tunnels exist under the entire city.<eos> Most people don't know that.<eos> The pictures of you two were a happy coincidence we came across when clearing Detective Dixon's apartment.<eos> Apparently he was keeping an eye on you.
Anything else about this party?<eos> Just that whatever you plan, you get on that bus, and it's fuck or run.<eos> It's hard, I won't lie.<eos> He filled this house up, you know?<eos> He loved you both as much as any man I ever knew.
A quiz?<eos> Well, that's interesting.<eos> All right, thanks, Sasha.<eos> We'll see you back at base.<eos> - 'See you back at the station.'
They're here about Cheryl.<eos> This is my wife, Lizzie.<eos> Terrible news.<eos> Terrible.<eos> Well, I'll leave you to it, then.
We did not care what price we had to pay for our freedom.<eos> All the Jews had to do was to pay homage to Rome.<eos> That is all.<eos> 20 gods if you wanted... but no!<eos> In your stubbornness and your stupidity, you refused to do the one thing that would have saved you.
She's barren.<eos> She'll never give the baby back.<eos> Can you talk to Eleazar? - No, I cannot.<eos> - You know him.<eos> I saw you together.
Once it's outside, let it spread more.<eos> Let it float up to the sky... until it reaches the moon.<eos> From the moon, let it spread further to the stars, scattering over all the stars.<eos> Now, bring back this energy, slowly return it to yourself.<eos> If you have stomach pain, let it fill your stomach, and cure you.
Let it float up to the sky... until it reaches the moon.<eos> From the moon, let it spread further to the stars, scattering over all the stars.<eos> Now, bring back this energy, slowly return it to yourself.<eos> If you have stomach pain, let it fill your stomach, and cure you.<eos> If you have a cancer, hypertension, diabetes, or aids, let this energy flood you and calm you, until you feel better.
Tell us what to do, Mom.<eos> I need you to spy.<eos> I want you to know every move the invaders make.<eos> Every step they take. Is that clear?<eos> Because after we're done feeding on your harvest, we're taking you to Mom.
Puffy?<eos> Puffy!<eos> He's gone.<eos> That's gratitude for you.<eos> You save him from the forest, and he abandons you.
Well, the visuals were great, but there was not much of a plot.<eos> I read lips.<eos> She was talking about y'all.<eos> What about us?<eos> She said she never going to let you through to see the Magic Man.
Why?<eos> Well, I heard you run a lot.<eos> He runs a lot.<eos> How'd you like the old man's boot up your ass?<eos> I will at least drop you off.
Yep.<eos> What have they done to you?<eos> When he wakes up he will only see you.<eos> - You're not coming with us?<eos> - I will see you again.
Grand master.<eos> Of course, I don't pay much attention to that master crap.<eos> In here, I'm the master.<eos> Your master.<eos> Try anything and I will cut you into little pieces, and mail you to your bitch Fuchsbau.
That's what I love about you, Cousin.<eos> You are so very patient.<eos> Never doubt my affection for you.<eos> Oh! By the king!<eos> "The king invites you to a private showing of diverse suits of lace... "
My champagne Mountain.<eos> Again, so sorry...<eos> A little wound up.<eos> Okay, but you know what?<eos> Why don't you guys head on upstairs and then, uh, when I call you back downstairs, it'll be just like we planned, right?
- Bye, girl.<eos> - But me and Zoey, we've always had the best relationship...<eos> - Ohh! - Until recently.<eos> Hey... what's going on?<eos> Your sister's supposed to be watching you.
- Let's all eat our fruit. - Yeah, I'll...<eos> I'll do that.<eos> Mommy, where you going?<eos> Aren't you putting us to bed?<eos> Oh, babies, I'm on-call again tonight, but I'll kiss you while you're sleeping, okay?
Her new family didn't want me.<eos> And I ended up with Kabir.<eos> Today, once again, we are all together... and all I can hope for is that<eos> this time it stays that way.<eos> God bless you!
(IN GERMAN) Walking on the highway is prohibited.<eos> - Can I see your papers?<eos> - Of course.<eos> I'll take you to a petrol station. You'll find your way from there.
We have people back at our camp in desperate need of food.<eos> Look, many of them are children.<eos> They're kids.<eos> No.<eos> I won't let you out.
That's how I always knew you:<eos> anxious.<eos> Dad is a totally different story.<eos> I love you, my parents.<eos> I think I've always loved you.
Previously on Gotham...<eos> Told you.
We have reason to believe that Robin is still alive.<eos> What?<eos> Well, then where is she?<eos> You haven't heard from her?<eos> No. I mean, if she had, I would have called you right away.
Burning up.<eos> He got in my head.<eos> He made me steal something from the lab.<eos> You can't let him talk to you.<eos> If he starts talking to you, he got you.
What day is it?<eos> Thanks.<eos> Let's look at this just released video from cyber whistle blower Adam Wexler.<eos> America keeps her secrets in a glass case with a sign that says,<eos> "Do not break." But I have a hammer and I will set you free.
I've seen the future without you.<eos> I can't let that happen.<eos> Langley just sent a new briefing.<eos> Does this have to do with Wexler?<eos> I have a hammer and I will set you free.
Well, before you shuffle off forever, may I show you something?<eos> I get it.<eos> I failed.<eos> No, no, no. Now, you're an incredibly clever guy, Cisco.<eos> So why don't you tell me why would I bring you down here?
[Chuckles] I'm not.<eos> But don't you worry about old stu 'cause I got red roof inn points, and they got color TV now.<eos> You guys.<eos> This is so incredibly sweet.<eos> - I was gonna invite you to stay.
Stop folding so loudly!<eos> We can't hear the TV!<eos> You know, I did not sign up for this.<eos> I could've been a lawyer!<eos> This is the third time I'm calling you down for dinner!
I'll just join you at the movie.<eos> - No way!<eos> - Oh, my God!<eos> Come on.<eos> I hardly ever get to see you anymore, and you're both growing up so fast, and... You did promise we'd spend the day together.
Louder!<eos> It's not real!<eos> Don't feel!<eos> Not that loud.<eos> She'll hear you, and then we're all in trouble.
No warrant for my arrest?<eos> Depends on what we find.<eos> What do you expect to find? Your son.<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> Maybe some evidence linking the two of you to the five women who were murdered in Las Vegas.
- Ah, come on, leo.<eos> You just need to stretch it out.<eos> - You can still spar with us.<eos> - No!<eos> I mean, I'd just hold you back.
I need to be my trimmest, officer.<eos> See, I report for duty in Cape May, in, well, less than 24 hours.<eos> Can you begrudge a father one last romp with his boy before the Navy ruins him?<eos> My apologies to you and your adult son, sir.<eos> I mistook you for a pair of common street screwers.
I already told him all this shit anyway.<eos> Oh, yeah, yeah, we had a great talk on the drive over.<eos> He says you guys are with Tigerhawk Security?<eos> He did, huh?<eos> Yeah, he said Tigerhawk used to have you overseas.
Oh, God!<eos> Starting with this loudmouth.<eos> That's right.<eos> You're all my insurance.<eos> So I really hope he likes you enough to come back.
Another McLeod disaster.<eos> What?<eos> When I was a child, I used to wonder...<eos> What is so special about you people that you have two countries to go between?<eos> And then, at school, we were told it was something called "British values" that set you apart.
Run!<eos> I am so sorry we're late.<eos> I know we said we'd be home earlier.<eos> What happened?<eos> Did the Smiths' dog go after you, too?
They both study hard, play violin, wear button-up shirts properly, not like you, buttoning the top button and letting the rest flap out like a cape.<eos> That's called being a "g," mom!<eos> Why do you want to be a letter that's only worth two points in scrabble? !<eos> "Q" is better!<eos> I'm sure you all know why I gather you here.
Don't shoot. Don't move, Chuck.<eos> - Can you walk?<eos> - Who are you?<eos> You need to get outside.<eos> The police will help you.
Louise joined that ghoulish group to torture herself.<eos> I hoped I could help.<eos> A lot of good it's done.<eos> Well, here's your chance to help that girl.<eos> I am taking you to your son.
You mean your lies.<eos> Yeah, you already told me I'd get Michael back once.<eos> You got my brother killed...<eos> I'll be damned if I get fooled by you again.<eos> Oh, I'm not the one who is fooling you now.
You got my brother killed...<eos> I'll be damned if I get fooled by you again.<eos> Oh, I'm not the one who is fooling you now.<eos> It's time to open your eyes.<eos> Someone else has been deceiving you.
They're still not answering.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> They should have been back by now.<eos> God help them.<eos> God help all of you.
Guys, this is Joshua we're talking about.<eos> We don't have a choice.<eos> She's right.<eos> Eliza said it takes all of us to stop the Horsemen.<eos> I'm telling you, it's a mistake.
He loves to give humans all the tools they need for their salvation and destruction.<eos> That's clearly what he did with the meteor he cast me down in.<eos> I'll be the first to admit, the whole Genesis element, I didn't see it coming.<eos> But you're just like me in that respect.<eos> If you think God's gonna reward you for blindly following the prophecy and launching those weapons, you're about to fail the biggest test of all.
Corporate is putting in a "self-fixin's" bar.<eos> It's outrageous!<eos> Civilians can't do it like us.<eos> Do you know how easy it is to overwhelm a potato with scallions?<eos> Let me end the suspense for you... very.
Excuse me, excuse me.<eos> Now, the Assistant Chief Constable is here to represent the constabulary, he's not a judge, this is not a trial, it's an interview and I'm conducting it.<eos> Your wife called a public meeting in Easterhope to discuss the source of various illnesses.<eos> Some of the people who said they intended to go were told that you were expected to attend, in your capacity as Medical Officer for the Factory Safety Board.<eos> No, I've already told you, I know nothing about that.
- This is a mid-century modern home.<eos> - Right. - And so it has a very open floor plan.<eos> Lots of light, which I love myself, personally.<eos> - And this fireplace, oversized fireplace. - Mmm.<eos> So what brings you to California then?
Ah, you guys are late.<eos> You're the decorators, right?<eos> He looks like a decorator.<eos> You moving in?<eos> Yeah. Why else would I have hired you?
Join me As I enter into and beneath the Sands of Hell.<eos> 1500 hours.<eos> Moving through the desert of Perfection, Nevada.<eos> Ground zero for war with the Graboids.<eos> For those of you newcomers, who don't have a clue about Graboids, let me bring you up to speed.
And I've always been a sportsman.<eos> So that's what we do here.<eos> We play.<eos> Now, I'm going to choose a weapon, and you run along.<eos> You have free reign, just know that I will find you.
You never answered my question about my visions.<eos> Where do they come from?<eos> I'm here, aren't I?<eos> Well, now he's your problem as well.<eos> Guess I'll just leave you two to the... Almighty.
Tandy, hold on, man.<eos> Man, I know this sounds crazy, but just give the guy a chance.<eos> We ain't got nothing else to lose.<eos> You don't know me, but I'm asking you anyway to stand up right now, right here, and make a decision a decision to change, to forgive, to be forgiven no matter what you've done.<eos> That's how much God loves you.
Is it much the same heard in Pontus these days?<eos> In Pontus, in Jerusalem, everywhere we go.<eos> Now do you see?<eos> We're lost.<eos> Do you think the Lord has left you?
When I look at all of you, all my children, there is only one face I see.<eos> It is the Lord's face.<eos> It is the face of my son, risen, alive, and breathing...<eos> As if he himself was right in front of me.<eos> My children, if you do nothing more in this life, remember the moment he first looked upon you.
Darkness was lifted, and you saw the great light.<eos> Remember that moment, and everything you do will glorify the Lord.<eos> Peace be with you.<eos> Do not be sad for me.<eos> Like him, I will never leave you.
Mr. YouTube?<eos> Yup, we're going straight to the top.<eos> Okay, first of all, the CEO of YouTube is not just gonna sit down with two random guys off the street.<eos> And even if he did, I'm pretty sure the guy's name is not "Mr. YouTube."<eos> Mr. YouTube will see you now.
People are gonna draw the conclusions.<eos> - I'm gonna have my RD team take a look at that.<eos> Now listen to me.<eos> Diri is gonna be your guide once you get through that portal.<eos> Anyplace you need to go, you tell Diri, she will take you there.
Nothing's over till I say it's over.<eos> I'm Steve.<eos> YouTube... I'm Steve YouTube.<eos> I win, you lose!<eos> Maybe if you two weren't so great at making complete jackasses out of yourselves, I wouldn't have even wanted you so bad.
Then shut the hell up and let me tell you what's gonna happen next.<eos> You and you and whoever else in this room who was behind you in this, are gonna go before that judge, and you're gonna own this screwup.<eos> And you better do a good job of it, because if you don't, you're gonna spend the rest of your career analyzing historical trends of Soviet grain reports.<eos> And, you, you'll get permanently promoted to the make-work and meaningless cases desk in our Peoria satellite office.<eos> As for the judge, well, he may take a look at all this and just decide that this task force and the leeway that you've been given is nothing more than a recipe for constitutional infringement and shut you all down!
Uh, excuse me, do you know how much longer it will be?<eos> A couple of more hours, at least.<eos> A couple... a couple more hours?<eos> We have really old computers.<eos> So, when they recruit you Agency guys, do they entice you with true stories of derring-do, like, say... this?
- Oh, my God!<eos> - Yes, yes, yes!<eos> New students, as I look out on you today I recognize that you must be feeling incredible excitemenL anticipation, and perhaps a little relief as \/\/ell.<eos> This is the day.<eos> As your parents learned when they dropped you off today what happens in college stays in college.
Good afternoon, this is your Director.<eos> Clich√© as it may sound, this is the first day of the rest of your life, so think about how you can effectuate positive growth.<eos> Focus your breath.<eos> Find your safest, happiest place.<eos> Calm your mind, and let my voice guide you.
- And murderers.<eos> - Beg for forgiveness!<eos> You're the ones who need to be forgiven, not me.<eos> You need to repent your sins.<eos> Or God will strike you down.
Not billions of years.<eos> Close your gab!<eos> Gentlemen, thank you.<eos> When was the last time you scientists read your Bible?<eos> It's not for mankind to solve God's mysteries and he will punish you come Judgement Day!
She is 15 years old.<eos> I don't care if he's a movie star.<eos> Just arrest him. [laid-back sitar music] ‚ô™<eos> Namaste.<eos> Can I help you?
So good for you.<eos> This experiment will be an extension of my research into the effects prisons can have on human behavior.<eos> And being that it's summer and the school's almost empty, we should have near complete privacy for this study.<eos> And as you'll soon see, we have cleared out some of the teachers' offices and converted them into prison cells, and the hallway will serve as the prison yard.<eos> But remember, just as you are watching the prisoners, my graduate staff and I will be watching you.
Just find a good landing place not far from the road.<eos> Otherwise, we'll carry them.<eos> No more mishaps with pistols.<eos> I would to hear only of success.<eos> May God bless you all.
Uh, I'm beginning to question now whether those orgasms were real.<eos> I'm not following you.<eos> Should I call Star Trust?<eos> Are you accusing me of...<eos> I'm not accusing you of lying.
I know what that is.<eos> You're taking core samples.<eos> I need to be a part of this.<eos> This could be a very important scientific site.<eos> Sergeant Andrews will escort you to your car.
Don't take it the wrong way.<eos> It's just that the whole Mennonite thing... it just made all of you seem like foreigners.<eos> What?<eos> I know.<eos> I'm sorry that sounded kind of prejudiced, but... it's just that you all stayed so close together and no one saw you outside of school.
Your... Action figures.<eos> Your...<eos> You have action figures?<eos> Yeah. Really?<eos> That's shocking to you? No.
Luther's gonna be pissed.<eos> Looks like you could use a ride.<eos> Now here I am, being all hospitable, and you don't even have the common courtesy to answer me.<eos> I don't need a ride, asshole.<eos> What do you want? Did pandy put you up to this?
You determines Margaux just to fucked her guy.<eos> No!<eos> Even worse... you have her do come to us to abut her ... and to its guy balls.<eos> You're not right in the head.<eos> If Becker caught you, it is an internal war.
- Are you?<eos> - Really?<eos> Yeah. I'm like a white Oprah.<eos> That's what I've been told, anyway.<eos> At any rate, once I realized you were victims and not suspects, I thought about it, and I remembered that weirdo atlas always calls you "lushes."
- Really?<eos> Yeah. I'm like a white Oprah.<eos> That's what I've been told, anyway.<eos> At any rate, once I realized you were victims and not suspects, I thought about it, and I remembered that weirdo atlas always calls you "lushes."<eos> Not like the rest of the building, who calls you "drunks."
I been looking everywhere for you.<eos> You know, one way in and out of this place ...<eos> I snap one of your traps, and you both take your eyes off the door?<eos> You're a smart girl, but I got a thing or two to teach you yet.<eos> I reckon I could see you both better if you stepped out this way.
You're gonna be a great dad.<eos> Anyway, don't you see?<eos> As many babies as possible, means there have to be two balls pregnant at any given time.<eos> So therefore...<eos> And this is the whole reason I brought you here, listen up.
They're the foundation of rational thought.<eos> And I think Ralph will be bored there.<eos> Uh, well, you know, I think...<eos> I think you geniuses hide behind a pile of facts and figures when you don't want to engage in something... unpleasant, like the idea of Ralph and me leaving.<eos> The more something bothers or scares you, the more you hide behind data.
I commend you gentlemen for working together on an action plan in the face of our current economic crisis.<eos> This great city is the financial center of the world, and this building, the Federal Reserve, is its beating heart.<eos> The fact that we have assembled the heads of every major bank and investment company, reaching across party lines, sends a strong message to markets around the globe.<eos> New York will reopen for business first thing tomorrow morning.<eos> No, it's I who applaud you.
For this, you can buy the boat.<eos> No. I need you to guide us safely to the other side.<eos> Who's "us"?<eos> 20 passengers exactly.<eos> And after I get you across to Red Hook?
Three travel permits and tickets.<eos> Done.<eos> I'm coming with you.<eos> I want to make sure Zack gets there safely.<eos> Have I told you how much I love you?
Did you find it?<eos> No.<eos> Where'd you meet the guy who sold you that?<eos> A cabin in the woods off Highway 22, a mile north of Post Road.<eos> I can't arrest you for this, but good luck when the Wesen Council finds out about it.
Wanna buy a smoke cloud?<eos> "Fire," "Storm," "Invisibility"?<eos> Wait, you can see me?<eos> You are the souls of sorcerers The Duchess has stolen.<eos> How despicable that she is using you for her own selfish ends.
Hunk?<eos> Keep it down.<eos> I'm busting you out of this joint.<eos> Russell, we're here to take you home.<eos> But I let you all down.
Putting humans on trial in the middle of this war, that's not an accomplishment.<eos> That, Captain, is treason.<eos> Take it easy.<eos> What?<eos> I hope you're keeping very good records here today, because history will judge you --allof you -- for what you're doing.
We're the perfect people to spy on him.<eos> Langley has our deceased narrowed down to one name:<eos> Mikhail Vostrov.<eos> I remember one time when I was a kid you called your friend Nikolai "Mikhail" by mistake.<eos> You can tell me everything, or I can turn you in.
Mikhail Vostrov.<eos> I remember one time when I was a kid you called your friend Nikolai "Mikhail" by mistake.<eos> You can tell me everything, or I can turn you in.<eos> Hey, Alex. Who died?<eos> You can tell me everything from the beginning, or I can turn you in.
- He looks superhot, right?<eos> I-Is that a bad thing to say?<eos> It ... it's not actionable, is it?<eos> I mean... he don't work for me.<eos> Okay, well, then I will meet you in the lobby.
But you haven't.<eos> It looks good.<eos> It's been a full 48 hours, so we're gonna get you back to your room.<eos> And your mom is on her way there now.<eos> If I don't make it, I want you both to know I love you very much.
I'll just live by myself then.<eos> Hmph, you're just a kid.<eos> You obviously can't do that.<eos> I'll live by myself.<eos> I'll become strong and get you all back for this!
- What is it?<eos> - Boss wants to see you...<eos> Gather around for wrap up.<eos> Good job today, everyone.<eos> See you all tomorrow with smiles.
Good mum.<eos> It's time.<eos> All right.<eos> Please take care.<eos> My people will get you out of the country.
Ursula, pout all you want, But I expect you home by high tide.<eos> Darling.<eos> Come.<eos> You're missing out on all the fun.<eos> I already told you... I don't know anything about this Author.
A locator spell might work on it. Sounds like a perfect job for you two.<eos> I'll take Regina and Hook, and we'll scope out the area where Cruella's holed up with Henry.<eos> Emma, I know you're still angry,<eos> - but avoiding us is not going to help.<eos> - I'm not avoiding you.
Then she was on the road again and it was... poof.<eos> The business was going.<eos> She came onstage and you had this overwhelming, emotional feeling coming from the audience just because she was there.<eos> Now listen to me.<eos> I love you very much.
And you will turn over your firearms.<eos> If that's a problem and you wish to return to your country...<eos> No.<eos> No problem.<eos> My men will escort you to your hotel.
From now on, no more wearing shoes in the house.<eos> But I need my arch supports. I got dad's wide-ass feet.<eos> We are also going to start speaking more mandarin at home.<eos> But I only know the bad words.<eos> Which is why I'm enrolling you in Chinese school after your regular school...
Just a moment!<eos> Your Honor, Officers Ernst and Laguardia are here for you.<eos> Right away.<eos> Right this way, officers.<eos> Mayor Heart will see you now.
Sergeant, there's been an incident at the museum.<eos> The sword's been stolen. OK.<eos> Thank you, Sergeant.<eos> I'm sorry, I'm needed in the museum.<eos> The Sergeant will escort you to the shooting range.
There can be no defense or clarification or mitigation of the truth... It simply is.<eos> And what is the truth?<eos> That God raised Jesus from the dead to sit at his right hand as prince and savior.<eos> And it was his spirit that freed us from your chains.<eos> You are aware that saying such things condemns you as false prophets, according to the law.
They will not be harmed and they will live longer...<eos> Supervisor, I wanted to... I wanted to ask about the...<eos> Not now, Rodricks.<eos> You're killing scientific curiosity.<eos> I admire the work you have done, but your scientific curiosity has led you dangerously close to forces that you could never have controlled.
- Here's my card.<eos> - He's here.<eos> The supervisor for Earth.<eos> You're killing scientific curiosity.<eos> Your scientific curiosity would've destroyed you.
Okay, thank you.<eos> It really is beautiful.<eos> Of course, the majority prefer Utopia, whatever "Utopia" really means.<eos> Can I ask you something?<eos> The Overlords, they really leave you alone?
~ Syrus...<eos> Insults whenever we meet.<eos> London, Paris, Rome.<eos> Still not working.<eos> And my guests arrived by taxi, so there's no-one here to drive you.
Get out.<eos> - Well, now.<eos> Here's a fellow who's clearly met Charlie Siringo.<eos> Well, if that man is a friend of yours, then you can't be any higher scum than he was.<eos> Now, I've told you for the last time.
It's really none of my business.<eos> My family is... very prominent in this town.<eos> Sometimes the way our business is run, it can breed enemies.<eos> Well, I don't judge.<eos> Leslie loved you all very much.
I'll take care of her.<eos> Your problem is, you've insulted me and my guests.<eos> I got to warn you boys, I'm pretty good at this.<eos> That's enough!<eos> Unless you want to watch him die before my partner kills you.
I'm actually worried about my mom 'cause she's been hurt before.<eos> This is all moving way too fast.<eos> Wow. Gina.<eos> That's really sweet.<eos> And the only reason I didn't tell you guys is 'cause I don't value you as people, so it's, like, why be honest?
Lady Felicia, how may I help?<eos> I'd like to make a deposit, please.<eos> This is a robbery!<eos> Stay where you are!<eos> Stay where you are or I'll kill all of you!
According to an official investigation, it's because you chose to pinch pennies on maintenance.<eos> We are still contesting the results of that investigation.<eos> No criminal charges have been filed.<eos> I hope that's not what you asked us here to talk about.<eos> If you've been following the news, you know that the killer claims that he's helping you.
Gentlemen, please don't, don't.<eos> Then, you will die here, your bodies never found, both of you.<eos> - Others will come for us.<eos> - We will run.<eos> And they will chase you!
God is still in the miracle business today.<eos> God is able to help us find a new normal, and overcome tragedy and loss, pain and suffering.<eos> And God is building us a better place.<eos> Heaven is real.<eos> I may not meet you here, this side of heaven.
I'm not buying it, Webster.<eos> You said you had it!<eos> Now where the fuck is it?<eos> I only said I had it to keep Sam alive, as a bargaining chip. I don't know.<eos> Look, I'd tell you.
- Ned, c'mon now!<eos> Here they are.<eos> Ready for your worst.<eos> Gentlemen, this is Krystina.<eos> She and her girls will keep you safe in the field.
- What do you need from me?<eos> - The manifest for the transport schedule, so we know which is our target train.<eos> I'll bring you the manifest if you'll get inside the SS building and find out what happened to our girls.<eos> - That's not how it works.<eos> - You trust that I won't give you away to the germans;
Bon.<eos> I wanted to bring you up to speed on the changes we're making in this office.<eos> Mike is suggesting that I fire some... or all of you.<eos> And I'm considering his suggestions.<eos> For now, I'm putting you all on notice.
Our bodies are natural conductors.<eos> I think our meta's been sucking up all the radiation around him and using it to power himself.<eos> Which is why the x-ray machines at the hospital failed the day of the rally.<eos> So if we want to find him, we gotta look for places without radiation.<eos> All right, guys, I don't want any of you here right now.
Seriously, man?<eos> You took all our guns, taped us to a bunch of chairs, called us fat, and we still took almost all of you out.<eos> Next year, we're winning this thing.<eos> Oh, you're not coming next year.<eos> But maybe I'll see you at the Pentagon Christmas party.
Meantime, Ryan's pulling camera footage from the surrounding area.<eos> Maybe we'll get lucky, catch our alien exiting one of the access points to the utility tunnel.<eos> Probably won't know anything till morning.<eos> All right, keep me apprised.<eos> Okay, why don't you think about anyone that would have wanted to breach your simulation, and we'll keep you posted on what we find.
You have the right to remain silent.<eos> Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.<eos> You have a right for an attorney.<eos> If you can't afford one, one will be appointed for you.<eos> - Do you understand these rights I've explained to you?
Things people are saying about Camille... that she's back.<eos> I told you, my daughter is dead.<eos> I have nothing else to say to you.<eos> Please be seated.<eos> Rowan and Tommy, the path that brought you together has been a steep and winding one, but I believe it has been leading you here.
- Did you hear me? - Yes, Sir.<eos> Only...<eos> Agent Fielding.<eos> I didn't call for the Secret Service.<eos> Can I help you?
I don't know where I was, but it was beautiful and peaceful.<eos> It was the most beautiful place I've ever seen.<eos> Did Oliver say anything to you?<eos> It wasn't in words, but he misses you.<eos> And he knows he'll see you again.
You have the right to remain silent.<eos> You have the right to an attorney.<eos> Take him.<eos> From now on... any officer, detective, rookie or clerk who breaks the law will not just lose their job, they will go to jail.<eos> If you turn a blind eye to crime, I will bust you.
Why didn't you just kill me?<eos> Because we're not like you, Julianna.<eos> We don't just kill people.<eos> Who are you kidding?<eos> Liam sent you.
VINCENT: Is that who you were talking about?<eos> The guy you think we're working for?<eos> You really don't know who he is, do you?<eos> No, we don't.<eos> Well, if Liam didn't send you to stop me, why did you?
Well, General, think that finished him off?<eos> Not a chance.<eos> (CROWD CHEERING) Now this is a homecoming.<eos> Hulk, I never lost faith in you.<eos> If you say a little green guy with a big head tricked you into wrecking this town, then I, for one, believe you.
They already have seen the real villain.<eos> They trusted you to protect them, and you attacked them and fled.<eos> They only trust me now.<eos> Stop spreading lies!<eos> Hey, if some goon framed you for smashing your hometown, you'd go nuclear beat-down on him too.
LEADER: Don't I recognize you two from somewhere?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> The national news.<eos> Seems you're out destroying New York.<eos> "Don't I recognize you from..." (MUMBLES MOCKINGLY)
If you lie to me, we'll spill your guts...<eos> I ain't lying, bright lord.<eos> Some bear-naming Gypsies passed by, then your man.<eos> My boys gave him some food and off he went.<eos> If you've been crowing out lies, we'll come back with the posse and kill you like sparrows.
Arrest the prisoner.<eos> Thanks, boys.<eos> We'll take it from here.<eos> Who's "we"?<eos> Me and my armed friends surrounding you.
What gives it its value are the people inside.<eos> That's us.<eos> [phone vibrates] Every time we go under, guys, we... we are holding hands with the devil.<eos> Now, thankfully, there's always five people pulling the other way.<eos> So I guess I'm telling you because I...
- And Ernesto?<eos> - This place...<eos> Tell me, sir, everything in these corridors... are time gates?<eos> Yes, and there are a lot more thanks to your book.<eos> I'll show you everything, inch by inch, but first Irene will take you to our medical service.
Hey! Let go of Miss Meena!<eos> Stay out of this.<eos> Stay out of it!<eos> Now, you go on peacefully back to town, nobody has to know about this.<eos> No one wants you in Nova Scotia.
To bring children into the world.<eos> To be free.<eos> With respect, uh, that's what you said in New York City but, uh, we're here.<eos> We have slaveowners and slave property, and desperate people indenturing themselves into servitude.<eos> Then I regret profoundly the disappointments that have shaken you so.
- Flying like birds?<eos> - Absolutely no, never.<eos> - Never say never.<eos> The civil servant who will welcome you is Gil P√©rez.<eos> He'll put you up to speed.
I call him and it cuts off or goes straight to the machine.<eos> - Esp√≠nola?<eos> Things must be bad...<eos> Sorry about the wait.<eos> We weren't expecting you so soon.
No!<eos> No!<eos> We are not men of violence.<eos> But, Peter, we've finally got him.<eos> You'd have thought that God uid haen you all a clearer vision if, in fact, he was guiding you.
Any novice crewsman can do it.<eos> Clench the butt, keep the gut pulled in.<eos> Perpendicularity is your friend.<eos> I could muster a few of these myself.<eos> Get off the deck, you halfwits, before I put you there permanently!
That's almost as good as the jordan news.<eos> Eh, not to fairchild.<eos> Who gives a shit about fairchild?<eos> The real tragedy is I have to get drinks with louis.<eos> Which is why I got you a secluded restaurant With a table in the back where no one will see you.
Wait.<eos> Where are you going? I'm taking the car back to the city.<eos> Well, what the hell are we supposed to do?<eos> Ray's waiting on the other side of the parking lot, isn't he?<eos> He'll drive you two back when you're done.
- Adri's fine.<eos> She's calmed down a lot. Hasn't she?<eos> We're all fine.<eos> Don't you worry.<eos> Dad's taking care of everything and he'll get you all out.
'If you looted, we will find you.<eos> 'If you've escaped from prison, we will hunt you down.' Floor it, babe.<eos> 'Life continues as it always has.'<eos> I promise this is not the end.<eos> God bless you, God bless the United States of America, and God bless humanity.
Like the hymen of a virgin, once torn, it cannot be repaired.<eos> You'll have to live with it for the rest of your life but will you still do it?<eos> Even though it's a one-sided crush, I will continue to love her in silence.<eos> So that whenever she does become mine, I won't be too flustered by it.<eos> Did you think that I'd send the two of you off together with a smile?
A firm of equal size, equal equity and also one without an office space.<eos> - What?<eos> - Yes.<eos> They were going through a move of their own at the same time as yours.<eos> So, why would Solis Securities leave you and join another firm that was homeless?
Earl.<eos> Someone should have put you out of your misery generations ago.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> What are the odds?<eos> I'll leave the three of you to your own misery.
You just wasted your time and mine.<eos> I just captured the exact moment when you realized you had failed.<eos> I guess we all got something out of this.<eos> (Holt) So that's it?<eos> This problem is beyond all of you?
So, how's that whole "trusting' Yondu" thing working out for you, Quill?<eos> Well, considering we got the prize and don't have to share, not bad.<eos> (GROANS)<eos> If you take that,<eos> Thanos will hunt you to the end of the universe!
Why?<eos> Because I'm in love with you. That's why.<eos> Who's in?<eos> Marie-Louise?<eos> If you do it, I don't want to see you again.
Sarah?<eos> - It's the police, love.<eos> - What do you want?<eos> Maybe we should speak inside, Mrs. Tate.<eos> I don't want you in my home.
Hello, uncle!<eos> Are you going to the hostel?<eos> Yes.<eos> Auntie, the road ahead is under maintenance.<eos> Shall I take you from another one?
You break the law and you get caught, you go to jail.<eos> - He's clean, Terry.<eos> - However... Tonight, you caught us in a very forgiving mood.<eos> On almost any other night, what would we do, bull?<eos> We'd throw your asses in the paddy wagon and send you to the tombs.
Obviously, I didn't want a record.<eos> You left your car over all night.<eos> You didn't stay at the hotel you said.<eos> - Where did you spend the night?<eos> - Please, I've already told you.
Baby Victoria is fine.<eos> I spoke with Mr. Palmer, and together we diagnosed her with a low-grade fever.<eos> First thing in the morning, she's gonna visit with her pediatrician.<eos> I didn't know she was sick.<eos> I thought I told you.
How am I gonna make it through a whole day without seeing you?<eos> I guess I'll just have to give you something to remember me by.<eos> Oh my damn.<eos> Oh, that doesn't mean anything.<eos> Hey, guys. Didn't see you there.
I'm the queen now.<eos> This isn't our home anymore.<eos> Our freedom awaits us on the other side of the dome.<eos> And I will guide you to it.<eos> That's why I've called you here.
I knew you couldn't be trusted.<eos> Don't move!<eos> You got us.<eos> Now what?<eos> I'm taking you back to Town Hall.
I know.<eos> I know.<eos> I know.<eos> It's classic, and it's awful.<eos> And why in the world would Richard sign you up for this?
Mr. Castle, I will thank you and your ridiculous allegations to wait outside.<eos> They're not just allegations...<eos> not anymore.<eos> Mike Sampson gave you up.<eos> A witness placed the two of you together, and Sampson was more than eager to distance himself from the murder.
Oh, my God.<eos> Booth!<eos> Hooshmand, what are you doing here?<eos> My men and I are here to protect you from the police.<eos> I told Danny I would keep you safe, so I keep you safe.
I don't need to know you to know that you should leave Marc.<eos> Me and Marc, we love each other.<eos> Sometimes we love the wrong people.<eos> Yeah, you know all about that.<eos> Do you think I can't hear you?
I give up. I give up.<eos> According to this signal, she's right here somewhere.<eos> We've been flushing them out toward the choke point.<eos> There's no way out.<eos> I'm telling you.
But when I realized he wasn't gonna drop that 50-inch plasma, I knew I had him.<eos> Welcome to Abe's, home of the hot beef.<eos> Can I interest you gentlemen in some mozzarella sticks while you decide on your order?<eos> Why do you sound like a waiter?<eos> I'm not just a waiter, I am a part-owner of this restaurant, which means providing you with a quality dining experience while turning you upside down and shaking every penny from your pocket.
The one who held up the liquor store when she was 65?<eos> Come on, man.<eos> Get out of here.<eos> I've heard that story three times, at least.<eos> - Oh, no. - I tell you.
They're not like you. ‚Äì¬†They can hurt us.<eos> ‚Äì¬†No.<eos> Mom told me what happened when you tried to leave.<eos> ‚Äì¬†What did she say?<eos> ‚Äì¬†They attacked you.
Happy anniversary!<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Bye guys, I love you!<eos> - Love you.<eos> Love you, too!
- What do you mean, you don't know?<eos> Hey, it's Grace.<eos> Leave a message and I'll get right back to you.<eos> - Well, thanks for letting me crash your... Dinner.<eos> I'd invite you back to my place, but I don't want you two to get the wrong idea.
She's renting that building.<eos> She has a long lease.<eos> You and I know leases can be broken.<eos> What I know is that that shop and that building is a part of her, and vice versa.<eos> What I'm bringing you into here, you're not selling houses anymore.
Here.<eos> What's this?<eos> Tea, soap, perfume oil... Cardamom spiced cookies.<eos> These cookies brought Tara and I together.<eos> Hmm, fate brought you together.
Okay-<eos> Fine.<eos> I'll stay.<eos> Okay, your ride will be here in 30 seconds.<eos> When the chopper lands, we're gonna be escorting you out single-file.
Yeah, you get us where we need to go, I'll make that happen.<eos> Okay-<eos> Now, the monitors down by the lab. I don't have access to them.<eos> They're pretty strict about their privacy.<eos> But this stairwell right here, that'll let you out closest to the lab.
Now, the monitors down by the lab. I don't have access to them.<eos> They're pretty strict about their privacy.<eos> But this stairwell right here, that'll let you out closest to the lab.<eos> Yeah, you got anything quieter?<eos> Well, the east stairwell, but that'll let you out on the other side of the building.
As soon as he comes round he'll be trying to fuck a nurse with his 'Best Mate Steve' story.<eos> Cheers, Padre.<eos> ~ What?<eos> ~ Where are the questions?<eos> Ooh, hello, chaps, didn't expect to see you here!
What you need to know is that the media's saying that a dead Vago in Reno is probably part of a drug deal gone sideways.<eos> So now I've got Felix shoving a hot poker up my ass, because my chapter is giving the feds more reasons to turn up the heat.<eos> Where'd you get that?<eos> Oh, well, that came in the mail from Reno.<eos> It was attached to the finger of the asshole who screwed you guys over.
I could be wrong, but...<eos> I remember the street, though...<eos> Convent Avenue in Harlem.<eos> The town house has a lovely Juliet balcony. _<eos> Sarge, Fin, I wasn't expecting you.
This plague has killed many, but let's not let it divide us any longer.<eos> We are still one nation.<eos> Join us.<eos> Push Sean Ramsey back to the sea, and let's restore this great nation together.<eos> God bless you, and God bless America.
He's been missing for a week!<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> They arrested a custodian 'cause of you.<eos> Peter, stay put.<eos> I'll call this in, and we'll get a crew out here to help you both down.
We were making out in the hallway when he pulled me into his room.<eos> Three guys were waiting.<eos> And they jumped me.<eos> Like a pack.<eos> And Brian led you in?
- You confirmed that they're just traffickers, no connection at all to the terrorism?<eos> What?<eos> That's it.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Theo Arn, he contacts you. He says that he has idea to make some cash.
I gotta say, I don't think that the FBI is going to believe that.<eos> - We are not terrorists.<eos> - Right.<eos> This was a plan by Theo Arn.<eos> He needed you there.
Agent McGee, Ms. Sciuto, glad you could make it.<eos> Follow me.<eos> We're tight on time.<eos> Any progress accessing Orlando's laptop?<eos> I'll let Petty Officer Goode fill you in.
I was moved.<eos> Well, I thought it was beautiful.<eos> Ah, thank you.<eos> The heat's off in here, fellas.<eos> This will help keep you warm.
We're building so close to a seismic fault, we have to go with prestressed concrete.<eos> This gravel's just mandatory for the mix.<eos> When until we get these magical earthquake rocks?<eos> Two, three weeks at the most.<eos> We'll keep you posted.
we've purged the company computers.<eos> But I must have the copies!<eos> There's... there's just one.<eos> I'll take you to it.<eos> Mr. Gilbert's going to take you on a field trip.
Don't feel badly.<eos> We made a plan, Lady Edith and I, but we forgot about emotion.<eos> And emotion's what can trip you up every time.<eos> God bless you, Drewe.<eos> God bless you and your family.
Look, honey, we'll be okay.<eos> No!<eos> Hey, hey, hey, fella, I'm glad to see you. We need to rent a chopper.<eos> Sorry, man. Everything's gone.<eos> As soon as I swap out this starter, I'm outta here. I wish I could help you, but it's only a two-seater.
- Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hello.<eos> Welcome to my home.<eos> Sveta's who suggested I call you.
He says he drives cocaine from the border area with Mali to the border area with Algeria and Libya.<eos> And he agreed to be interviewed, but only if we don't reveal his name or show his face.<eos> How many people in Agadez do you think are involved in any form of trafficking?<eos> (speaking Tamasheq)<eos> So there was no chance that the government, the army, or the police might catch you?
I'm sorry for your loss.<eos> But if your father was killed because of what he knew, he must have had proof, evidence.<eos> Did he have anything on a company called Societel Mining?<eos> How does a former U.S. attorney become Yusuf's lawyer?<eos> Who was the mutual friend that introduced you?
I can hook you up. Where is Seth?<eos> I don't know.<eos> That's smart, too.<eos> Stay separated.<eos> That way they can't put you together.
Why?<eos> Where's Phil?<eos> He's at the squad room.<eos> He sent us to... make sure that you and the baby were safe and sound.<eos> Phil sent you here?
What's the risk?<eos> We got 250 orders waiting to be filled.<eos> We sure do, but we're a little old to be betting' our future on this.<eos> So, what?<eos> Stan take you out, fill your head with visions of VC money flowing through the streets?
I am the same.<eos> When I got a call from the agency saying they had found a couple, I just wanted to be sure.<eos> I love my baby, and if I could afford to live in a house like this in addition, give him a life like you, two could...<eos> I know in my heart what I am doing is right.<eos> So the agency will contact you both if it is a fit in addition, if Bridgette agrees.
Hey, Charlie.<eos> Sully had better be alive.<eos> She is alive.<eos> Shut up, Dwayne.<eos> Police are already looking for you.
Their alliance effects sea change in every aspect of human life-- the value and distribution of commodities, money, weapons, water, fuel, the food we eat to live, the information we rely on to tell us who we are.<eos> What exactly do you expect us to do with this information?<eos> Study it, investigate it to determine the truth, and then report it.<eos> Let me be clear.<eos> Investigating this group will immediately position you as a threat.
Who needs to watch it when you're always quoting it?<eos> That is enough.<eos> Rabbi Shapiro, I'm so sorry you had to see this.<eos> No, you shouldn't be.<eos> Finally, I get to see you as a couple!
[knocking] Mr. Norcross.<eos> Detectives Dawson and... Orbinsky?<eos> That's close enough.<eos> Glad you came.<eos> Had you on my call sheet.
Our company, law enforcement, the entire Chicagoland community together.<eos> The day I stand next to you is the day I walk you into a cell.<eos> Until then...<eos> (Platt) You two, nice work today.<eos> Keep this up, people might start confusing you for the real police.
You think a little burn gonna make me talk?<eos> You know what, bitch?<eos> You don't have to talk... 'cause your boyfriend's gonna do it for ya.<eos> Come here.<eos> You go after Carter because he robbed you, or 'cause Roland gave you orders.
A-BOMB: Dracula?<eos> Welcome, my old friends.<eos> Hulk?<eos> A-BOMB: Looks more like Count Hulkula.<eos> I haven't seen you in well over a hundred years.
The agent is the asset.<eos> You said it had important data stored in it.<eos> Yes.<eos> In his brain.<eos> Now get him out of there before Hydra discovers you.
You two are my redheaded pillars of unconditional love.<eos> To my friends at the 12th precinct...<eos> You let me in.<eos> Especially you two, Javier, Kevin.<eos> You've made me your brother-in-arms, and I thank you for that.
shining.<eos> It was worth leaving?<eos> I do not know if it was worth.<eos> Every day...<eos> I thought I would never see you, And set foot on my land.
- What?<eos> My grandfather had a heart attack.<eos> He's in intensive care.<eos> If either one of you starts crying,<eos> I'm gonna have Nurse Ratchet out there kick you the hell out of here.
The difference being, there's a limit to my greed, and I'm willing to put it in writing.<eos> Oh, I'd pay very close attention to that writing, especially the fine print. See, 'cause her middle name is "loophole".<eos> You two are charming, but... the bottom line is... If I want to make a deal, the only deal I'll make is in the best interest of my people.<eos> Of course.<eos> Now, I've asked my son to join us while I hear you out. He's my best adviser and especially good at cutting through the bull.
He's a part of me, and I am a part of him.<eos> Is that why you saved his life?<eos> - You would deny it?<eos> - I could not see him die.<eos> The bond between you is stronger than I realised.
We are not lowlifes.<eos> And no, we never hit each other.<eos> What do you think we are? Savages?<eos> Then shut the hell up and stay away from each other.<eos> Or we're hauling you off to jail. You got it?
How about some breakfast.<eos> ...while we're waiting for him?<eos> Do you eat omelets'?<eos> - Why did you run in the first place?<eos> - She was testing you two.
With all the earthquakes and the rising tar, the pickings are getting slim down here.<eos> Soon, nothing in the Lower Valley will survive.<eos> And when we get rid of Tyra, the Upper Valley is ours for the taking.<eos> We need an edge, which is where you come in.<eos> So you better have brought us some good news, or start hoping we can eat you in just one bite.
- I'm inventing a new sport!<eos> Oh, boy!<eos> Ernie!<eos> Oh, great.<eos> Okay, I'm gonna explain the plan one more time, and I swear if you don't get it, I'll dump you in a tar pit myself!
an expert in animal behavior, a journalist, safari guide, foreign intelligence agent, and a veterinary pathologist.<eos> Our task: to find out what is happening with the animals, why it's happening, and how to stop it.<eos> Previously on Zoo...<eos> The global pandemic your father believes was about to emerge, it appears it has arrived.<eos> And that's why I had Monsieur Alves bring the five of you together.
It sounds to me like Lewis doesn't, like he won't care if people die.<eos> That's why I can't leave this alone.<eos> Then everyone will know who The Flash is under that mask.<eos> I don't care.<eos> I will take you down anyway.
Feels like it's gonna...<eos> Nobody talks to my son that way.<eos> Nobody.<eos> Don't worry, sir.<eos> I waited for you this time.
Ah, negative energy density with positive surface pressure.<eos> It's genius.<eos> You created CFL Quark Matter?<eos> It's something we perfected on my Earth.<eos> I'll show you sometime.
Come with me.<eos> The state of this country is the most precarious it has ever been.<eos> Not only are there more threats than ever before, but the majority of those threats don't come from known organizations or extremist groups, but our own backyard... a neighbor you grew up next to, a one-night stand you had,<eos> You applied here to protect your country from those threats.<eos> And while your ideals and your test scores might have gotten you here, they will not be enough to keep you here.
Buddy, you can't go it alone.<eos> We won't let you.<eos> This is the way it has to be.<eos> I need all of you Hulks here to help the Earth in case I don't make it.<eos> I'm not ordering you as your leader, I'm asking you as family.
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!<eos> Champion marksman, Rhodes Scholar...<eos> - Whoo-hoo! - And proud debutante.<eos> These are the faces you present to the world... the story you tell about yourself.<eos> But underneath that narrative lies the psychology that drives you.
Where's all their stuff? ‚ô™ New York ‚ô™ Your boy didn't tell you?<eos> This wasn't their midterm.<eos> It was their final.<eos> ‚ô™ She's had her moment of glory ‚ô™ Well, for those who made it through, anyway.<eos> Because this job will test you.
This wasn't their midterm.<eos> It was their final.<eos> ‚ô™ She's had her moment of glory ‚ô™ Well, for those who made it through, anyway.<eos> Because this job will test you.<eos> It will push you beyond the limits.
Because before you go home for your three-day weekend, we're giving you some homework.<eos> What?<eos> !<eos> When you are an agent, work will always be on your mind.<eos> Victims will haunt you, evidence will elude you, cases will stay with you...
I can't do it!<eos> We're going to regret this, Joris.<eos> He's Papycha's brother, he's part of our family!<eos> Nonshenshe!<eos> I didn't ashk you for anyshing!
You should come with me.<eos> The family could open for me.<eos> - What?<eos> - That would be wonderful.<eos> People would love you.
Look at it.<eos> It's gross.<eos> Lots of greenery.<eos> No evidence of the drought here.<eos> Now let me take you to interior mansion day.
Too bad you were not here.<eos> Everybody saw you on TV.<eos> My mother sends her regards she thought you were damn good.<eos> That's nice of her, thanks.<eos> So we spoke about the cop who drove you home the other day.
We were just talking about you.<eos> Oh, that's never good.<eos> Hello, Vi.<eos> I'd get up and give you a kiss, but you're all the way over there.<eos> It seems so odd, but I could have sworn I saw you both on the street just now.
Oh! Stuart!<eos> Stuart, darling.<eos> Violet.<eos> Ash.<eos> I didn't even see you both.
Freddie!<eos> Stuart.<eos> Violet.<eos> Ash.<eos> I didn't even see you all there.
I'm sorry. You are?<eos> Oh, my name is of no consequence.<eos> What is, is that my company has taken over the planning service of The Plaza Hotel.<eos> Here's our brochure.<eos> Mm, I can see by the look on your faces that bitch Patricia, she did not tell you.
Not interested.<eos> Take this traitor to the dungeon where he belongs.<eos> You're not the only couple with hearts that beat as one.<eos> The second you lock us up, our friends will know something's wrong, and your secret's out.<eos> Who said we're locking you up?
But I'm glad you stopped beating yourself up about it.<eos> Good night.<eos> Um, so, firstly, I want to say, um...<eos> I've been really overwhelmed by all your messages.<eos> If I've inspired you in any way, it just makes it all worth it.
I should've left all those guys back on Berk.<eos> Now they're cocooned in that crazy rock stuff, I'm being chased by an angry Deathsong, and I'm stuck here with a wild Thunderdrum who can't hear a word I'm saying.<eos> Wait a second.<eos> If you guys can hardly hear a thing, then you probably can't hear the Deathsong's call.<eos> And if you can't hear the Deathsong, then it can't lure you in.
Too many towns.<eos> And then that's, uh...<eos> Oh, and this... this is Imagine Dragons. - Hello.<eos> - Oh, hello, Dragons!<eos> - Mm. - Big fan since they booked you.
That's why you didn't kill Malvado.<eos> You've got something bigger planned, something that gets everyone what they want.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You two try and hate each other, but...<eos> God keeps bringing you back together.
A prisoner before Brisbane saved me.<eos> Brisbane promised the Molderos would pay for what they did to me.<eos> The keys are in the ignition.<eos> The gas tank is filled.<eos> Be home before sunset or the Molderos will kill you.
My butt isn't part of this particular equation.<eos> Drat!<eos> How did you make it past my one guard? !<eos> Very well.<eos> There's only one way your family can save you.
He vowed to get back at me.<eos> Actually, he said he would erase me.<eos> I mean, who even talks like that?<eos> So you want us to be your bodyguards.<eos> I know that you're not exactly thrilled with me right now, but if I die, that candle's magic dies, too, and then there's nothing stopping you from changing back into wolves.
You can reach me if you try.<eos> Please help me!<eos> That's not our business as long as Summer is thriving.<eos> Taco time!<eos> I hope it pleases you as the head desires.
"The Republicans are trying to bring back slavery,<eos> I swear to God!<eos> I'm not lying to you!"<eos> He know how to rattle us.<eos> "Vote for Barack, I bullshit you not.
Quick, Todd!<eos> The mattress pile!<eos> Jump to safety!<eos> No! Bees, help!<eos> Your queen commands you!
Whoa, can't I help?<eos> Here's 10 bucks.<eos> There's a Squirt machine by the garage.<eos> Get five cans. You got it.<eos> I won't let you down.
America.<eos> Freedom.<eos> Ameri-Freedom.<eos> Good. He's saying all the right things!<eos> Like my opponent pointed out, I may not have a pretty face, but if you want a candidate that will listen to you, well, I'm proud to be all ears.
It doesn't make sense!<eos> He's almost acting just like... like...<eos> Widdle old me.<eos> Aha! Hello there! Long time no see.<eos> Except in my revenge fantasies where I see you on an hourly basis.
It is moving off, though, sir.<eos> Most likely to make repairs.<eos> I have my orders.<eos> To get you and yours to Chi Ceti IV at all costs.<eos> As we execute a flyby orbit, your dropship will take you and your crew planet-side.
And after that, I will travel to your home, and do the same thing there.<eos> All right, I'm just curious-- did you rehearse that speech in a mirror this morning, or this all just off the cuff?<eos> Why would you risk the lives of your friends and family for two strangers?<eos> 206 times I have killed him.<eos> What hubris possesses you that makes you think that you can prevent me from doing so again?
Sorry, wrong number.<eos> It's been a while. Do you miss us?<eos> Why can't you just leave me alone?<eos> We're a part of you. We always will be.<eos> I don't need you anymore.
Last shot wins!<eos> Go!<eos> Let's go!<eos> All right.<eos> See you after school.
I'll admit that to you fine people.<eos> I learned, and I should have already known this because I've been on the road doing stand up for 11 years,<eos> (audience cheers) and- - Thank you.<eos> Now I get to be here.<eos> And I- - This is gonna make some of you gasp.
I don't say that to shock you or-- or get your attention-- Like, "Oh, no she didn't."<eos> Like, I'm just reminding you that we're all disgusting.<eos> No one in here is better than anyone else.<eos> Like, you've all caught a hot load, you know?<eos> Like, if that provides you with discomfort, you're just looking at it the wrong way.
Unfortunately, I can't say much more than that, but we do appreciate your cooperation.<eos> Great, just in time.<eos> This is Juliette Chang, my lab assistant.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> Juliette will take you through security, give you a tour.
So anyone entering the secure part of our lab needs to go through a decontamination process.<eos> It seems like it should be the other way around.<eos> She's too smart for you.<eos> I'll be turning on an ultraviolet light that will destroy any potentially harmful contaminants that may be on your bodies.<eos> After we're done here, I'll escort you to the vacuum room.
- Bottoms up.<eos> - One more thing.<eos> The higher the CPMs, the less time you should stick around.<eos> Once they hit 300, get the hell out.<eos> After that, all the potassium iodide in the world is not gonna help you for long.
- my mother's invite.<eos> - You kidding?<eos> This is way more fun than we were expecting!<eos> Well, thank you for coming.<eos> Your notable reputation greatly precedes you.
Every penny.<eos> I want my old room, and if you haven't cleaned up that thing,<eos> I could use that check back.<eos> Well, welly, well... [chuckles]<eos> So you ditch me, come crawling back, expect me to welcome you with open arms?
GPS can't even find us on my phone.<eos> No we're not on a private road.<eos> We're in the middle of the state highway right now.<eos> Why is it so hot?<eos> ...we can't help you.
But now the cocaine encapsulated the bodywork.<eos> The insurance company does all the work.<eos> You should pick the cars and drive to a place where Major takes over.<eos> You take a flight to Oslo, then taxi to Drammens industrial park.<eos> You meet someone of the Major people that will help you further.
Stop the energy core from melting down or else Metropolis becomes a lifeless radiation hot zone for the next 10,000 years.<eos> That's a pep talk?<eos> Remind me to never attend your motivational seminars.<eos> Let's do this, guys.<eos> Don't worry, fellas, I'll have you out of danger in a flash. Ooh.
He'll have to keep up that shield and won't be able to attack.<eos> Think so?<eos> Meet my new best friend.<eos> It's called a Father Box.<eos> Doesn't this just bowl you over?
They're my blood. None of them would have done anything like this.<eos> Look, I wasn't even around whenever this girl died. Okay, I was...<eos> I was at Alison's mother's.<eos> Your mother-in-law is your alibi?<eos> She hates me, so, if I wasn't there, she'll tell you.
We brought Edgar back from Bolivia.<eos> Helped set him up his restaurant.<eos> The American dream.<eos> After San Martel?<eos> The Navy send you?
Or is there somewhere else you'd rather go?<eos> No, no.<eos> I just want to go home.<eos> Um...<eos> I would invite you in...
I had a tutorial group in the afternoon.<eos> And then I was playing blackjack in the evening.<eos> - Alone?<eos> - With David.<eos> I didn't tell you because at the time it didn't seem important.
- Why?<eos> - We know what time the second bomb was posted.<eos> You couldn't pin it on me so you're having a go with her? Is that how it works?<eos> Please just answer the question.<eos> You lot failed my daughter when she really needed you.
Happy, if this guy makes a move, you crack him with the boom mic and run right to the van. I'm a location scout.<eos> It seems we've filmed every bit of this country, but the idiot producers want us to find something more exotic.<eos> You know what it's like.<eos> Do I.<eos> Well, I'll see you around the set.
Lara Vega,<eos> Dashiell Parker...<eos> Metro Police.<eos> We're looking for Mark Massero.<eos> Please follow the blue line, and someone will assist you.
You were never the problem.<eos> How many times can I ask you to save him?<eos> As many times as you need to.<eos> All right, thanks, Nell.<eos> We'll keep you posted.
Now, I've never endorsed a political candidate before but this election, I'm making an exception because we have an exceptional candidate running for mayor.<eos> His name is Andrew Dixon.<eos> I know him to be honest, hardworking, and as concerned about this city as I am.<eos> Go to his website, learn more about what he stands for.<eos> I hope you vote in this election, and I urge you to vote for Andrew Dixon.
Yeah.<eos> So finish your homework.<eos> You can play more tonight, ok?<eos> Ok.<eos> See you later.
- This is Dr. Tozzi. - Clara.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> My father. Tommi is still very confused.<eos> Make him feel comfortable.<eos> Should he not remember you, don't force him.
Ship will not be necessary.<eos> Cosmo know, how you say, short cut.<eos> Continuum Cortex.<eos> Built into Knowhere's brain, is nexus point to anywhere in universe.<eos> Cosmo beam you onto Korath ship, so you head them off at pass.

The sooner we give her what she wants, the sooner this is over.<eos> Amen to that, girl.<eos> Yeah, you're buying me a new purse.<eos> - Sure.<eos> - Have-have you given any thought to what you would say to a child who-who saw you in that situation?
He's wanted in a double homicide.<eos> - What?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> So a little less attitude, a little more information would be really appreciated before we get pissed off.<eos> Look, if I knew where he was, I would tell you, but I don't and that's the truth.
I just had to see you two fight in person.<eos> Drax the Destroyer.<eos> A huge fan.<eos> And the lovely, lethal Gamora.<eos> Your reputation precedes you.
But I do not resemble Rocket.<eos> Sarcasm.<eos> Look into it.<eos> Grandmaster: I did say you two would fight.<eos> The game was getting you here.
PETER: Yeah, but you got us, too.<eos> ROCKET: "Nice maneuver, Rocket."<eos> "Quick thinking, Rocket."<eos> "Thanks for saving our worthless hides, Rocket."<eos> (SCOFFS) Would a little gratitude kill you?
I have resisted the urge to feast on your roasted carcass, so far.<eos> Oh, now the love-fest starts.<eos> Before, it was "Rocket, do this,"<eos> and "Rocket, I need that!" Oh, forget it.<eos> I'm quitting you losers for good.
His buddy Phil was getting ticketed for speeding in Issaquah when they were supposed to be together. ‚ô™ There's only nightmares ahead of us ‚ô™ ‚ô™ And sweet dreams long ago ‚ô™<eos> Thank you.<eos> Keep it going for Olivia Moore!<eos> ...take a little break.<eos> So, we'll see you back here in about ten minutes.
I don't understand why people like you.<eos> Oh. That's easy. Why?<eos> If folks had to pick between Justin Bieber, Kim Kardashian and a dead terrorist,<eos> I win that contest fucking hands-down.<eos> Thank you. I kill you. Thank you.
Chopper?<eos> - What is that?<eos> - It looks like a probe droid.<eos> My pet told me you were here.<eos> I've been searching for you for some time.
We made it.<eos> Good plan, Zeb.<eos> Let's not get all emotional.<eos> It wasn't a big deal.<eos> But I did save both of you and got some medical supplies by myself.
Attention!<eos> What are you looking at?<eos> You little chicks!<eos> Should I brush you with oil and fry you up?<eos> Or should I stir you in red pepper sauce and make spicy chicken stew out of you?
It's 200 yangs..<eos> Find Prince Jung-hyun's Journal for me.<eos> Don't fulfil more orders for that scholar, okay?<eos> Since Father's against it, I can't carry it out.<eos> See you again soon.
Not another word.<eos> Who are you?<eos> I am Forbidden Quest.<eos> - Seize him! - Yes, sir!<eos> This man will lead you safely to the docks.
You're right.<eos> I'm a vampire like Gwi.<eos> So your fear of me is justified.<eos> However, I've been seeking the secret Journal for the last 120 years in order to destroy Gwi.<eos> The king will question you himself.
- Yeah.<eos> You sure about this?<eos> Well, it's the only thing that makes sense.<eos> All right, Nathan Whitcomb.<eos> Don't let the nice house fool you.
Oh, come on, Bones, you know what she's talking about.<eos> Well, not always, you have a tendency to say the exact wrong thing at the worst possible moment.<eos> And then other times, I say exactly what is needed.<eos> Like this morning when I skillfully negotiated sex, not just once but twice.<eos> God bless you, child.
Absolutely.<eos> We'll test you to see if you're a match.<eos> - Yes, right now.<eos> - We want to.<eos> Warren, DeLuca, make that happen, and I'll see you down in the pit.
Is that a threat?<eos> Yeah, exactly.<eos> See, you're getting it.<eos> Yeah, well, I know where you work, all right?<eos> And if you mess with me, I'll report you, then I'll pound your asses into the ground.
- All points, we're on high alert.<eos> The suspect may be in the building.<eos> And I believe you will, too.<eos> Far left, wheelchair.<eos> God bless you, and God bless
Korath and Nebula had to think I'd turned.<eos> See?<eos> I knew she'd never stab us in the back.<eos> True.<eos> If I really wanted to betray you, I'd stab you in the front.
But we aren't.<eos> I'm not.<eos> I'm not either!<eos> That is completely irrelevant, okay?<eos> What matters, and the reason I brought you in here,
‚ô™ Heading on up to South Park, gonna see if I can't unwind ‚ô™<eos> ‚ô™ Mrph rmhmhm rm!<eos> Mrph rmhmhm rm!<eos> ‚ô™<eos> ‚ô™ Come on down to South Park and meet some friends of mine ‚ô™ All right, everyone, listen up. I don't know about you, but I, for one, am sick and tired of hate speech that serves to marginalize others.
I want to see ball movement, proper screens, hard cuts to the hole.<eos> And if I don't, I'm going to run you like dogs.<eos> Let's go, ladies!<eos> Hustle!<eos> I tried to warn you, you want to dance, you got to pay the band.
Blomfeld has the weight and reach of D.I.A. behind him.<eos> Unless he doesn't.<eos> There were only three of them at Wally's.<eos> He arrived without a warrant, ransacked Wally's place, and never brought him in for questioning... why?<eos> He doesn't want anyone else at D.I.A. to know he's looking for you.
Ah.<eos> Huh?<eos> Oh, no. You metal creeps ain't experimenting' on us again!<eos> Subject 89p13, subject 27q99.<eos> We have been tracking you for some time, via your cybernetic implants.
I cannot support it.<eos> Oh, oh! Now you done did it!<eos> You are officially uninvited from the hottest wedding of the season!<eos> [Xixi] A royal wedding. An event that comes but once every five to seven months, depending on food supply and predator mating habits.<eos> I'm Xixi, and I'll be here with you for every bow, every vow, and every... couldn't-come-up-with- a-third-word-that-rhymes.
It's the only way out for you.<eos> Look, the driver you put us onto had a phone.<eos> Somebody wiped the data.<eos> Can you recover it for us?<eos> Look, if you can keep me safe, I can do things that can honestly scare you.
Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Meditation might really help you.<eos> Yes!<eos> Man, have I told you guys how much I appreciate you lately?
So, effective immediately, I'm done taking you guys for granted.<eos> Really.<eos> I'm not gonna ask you to get me gummy worms...<eos> I'm not just gonna ask you to get me gummy worms.<eos> I'm also gonna treat you like the trained agents that you are.
15'll get you 20.<eos> You got that right.<eos> 15 also makes those photos on your cell phone child pornography.<eos> Let's go.<eos> How many times do I have to tell you?
That gives you the right to threaten me?<eos> You feel threatened?<eos> A little girl was murdered.<eos> We need a list of all your male relatives.<eos> - I can't help you.
Hey, Sergeant.<eos> You... you want to join us?<eos> Uh, rain check.<eos> Paperwork.<eos> Meet you up there.
Are you not aware of the danger, you idiot?<eos> The ground is dry as bone.<eos> A forest fire could ignite in seconds!<eos> - Sorry, sir!<eos> - Yeah, you will be if I catch you again.
What are these for? (speaking Spanish) Huh?<eos> (chuckling): Yeah.<eos> That isn't on the list.<eos> Well, we need something to carve the turkey.<eos> Hola. How can I helping you?
We need the police to find the woman accusing Boden, for one.<eos> As long as she's in the wind, it doesn't look good for your chief.<eos> And in the meantime?<eos> Keep your heads down.<eos> And if anyone provokes you, do not retaliate.
I thought it was about selling the house, that it was stupid pride.<eos> If I'd realised he was depressed, that he was ill, if I'd known...<eos> He'd never have let you help him.<eos> I'd like to have tried.<eos> Edward and Olivia Sidwell, I am arresting you for attempting to pervert the course of justice.
With millions of people from other countries dying for your freedom.<eos> But, see, now, now there are B-2 bombers,<eos> EMP strikes, ICBMs with nuclear payloads!<eos> This time, the chaos is taking you down, too.<eos> So if preventing World War III doesn't motivate you, how about a little naked self-interest?
Are you saying we put a black tag on a living patient?<eos> You want us to decide who lives and dies?<eos> We want you to decide whose life you can save.<eos> And prevent the next doctor or EMT who comes along from spending precious time on an unsalvageable patient.<eos> There's nothing in your training that's prepared you for this.
You have the power to do that.<eos> So I ask you, please... give it your full and fair consideration.<eos> Do that critically here as citizens of Manitowoc County. Where we stayed to pick a jury.<eos> [Kratz] I don't believe it's a difficult decision because everything in this case pointed towards one person, towards one defendant.<eos> I'm thanking you at the conclusion of this case on behalf of the State of Wisconsin and urging you, urging you, to follow the court's instructions, to follow the evidence in the case and return verdicts of guilty.
This mountain now yields before my magic.<eos> Loki and ymir, stand down or perish!<eos> Hear me out.<eos> I have a proposition.<eos> Come with me to midgard, help me claim jolnir's powers, and I will reward you in ways your former master never did.
I was all messed up last night. With the coke and the booze and...<eos> All right, George, you want to fuck with me?<eos> I'll fuck with you.<eos> Try releasing my shit.<eos> Sue the shit out of you motherfuckers, I'll be on your fucking ass so fast!
Secondly... Call me Admiral or Ironsides or Admiral Ironsides or Your Highness, but never again refer to me as your Uncle Joey!<eos> What happened to your face, Uncle Joe-oh, Ironsides?<eos> Old Admiral?<eos> Not that you're old.<eos> If you do, I'll joyfully tie an anchor around your necks and send you straight to the depths to meet Davey Jones himself.
Try and figure out what he's up to.<eos> Once you do, call it in.<eos> This is a direct line to the Coast Guard.<eos> But what about you?<eos> I'd only slow you down.
I promise.<eos> I, too, recommend calling the Coast Guard, but what do I know?<eos> We looked up to you.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> Well, I despise you.
Mommy?<eos> How do we say Mommy?<eos> - Like this?<eos> - Yes.<eos> She says she is happy. And... she loves you.
Nicky?<eos> Tara?<eos> I know these names.<eos> I hear goof boy talk about you.<eos> He says he will always help you, because you are his friends.
Is that's what's happening?<eos> Is that what's going on?<eos> Don't think that I don't see what's happening here. Have you seen the way that he...<eos> he keeps looking at you, the way that he keeps touching you?<eos> I saw you last night!
Whatever we can do to help.<eos> I mean, my God.<eos> It's awful.<eos> Alright, thanks.<eos> - You want me to show you out?
Hey, hey!<eos> Oh, no!<eos> - Hey! - Oh!<eos> Everyone, get out.<eos> I don't want you here.
She says people are dying in Naples because of the poverty!<eos> That's what they think of us in Florence, they see us as uncivilized.<eos> The envy of outsiders is only equal to the idiocy of those who govern us, that's the truth.<eos> "I see another cat, it seems the big dipper with the little.<eos> Oh cats, lamp of my study... oh beloved cats, if God saves you from a thrashing, if the heavens provide you with meat and milk, give me light to write these solemn poems...
All right, go. Go, go, go, go, go!<eos> Wait.<eos> Move and you're dead!<eos> All those college degrees and you guys are so stupid, you didn't even check the signature on the painting.<eos> You let an old man rip you off.
We've been calling him Randall.<eos> Good old Randall, he's been with me since he was a little fish.<eos> Both: Oh. - Okay then.<eos> I will go out and warm up the crowd.<eos> And then I'll bring you out one by one.
Falling leaves.<eos> Actually, Dai Donovan made a speech at our local pub and he's a pretty tough act to follow, so maybe now is the moment for my musical tribute to Judy garland.<eos> Look, we raised this money because we want to help you.<eos> And that's it.<eos> And we'll keep on trying to help you for as long as you want us to because we've been through some of the same things you've been through.
Ah, you know Mozart?<eos> I call all music Mozart!<eos> We're here to stop you with the help of the teenage abstinence class!<eos> If you defeat this madman,<eos> I'll release you from your pledge and teach you other fun ways not to get pregnant.
Is that...him?<eos> It is.<eos> - This is the address?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> If you'll follow me, the commander will see you now.
You do?<eos> Well, you need to get it here at once.<eos> Cleveland, Humboldt Hotel.<eos> Penthouse, of course.<eos> When you get here, I'll take you to Abaddon.
Cool.<eos> Cool.<eos> I've been going over unsolved cases from the past nine months, and there's been a sharp increase in unexplained deaths and missing people.<eos> Your meta-humans have been busy.<eos> Now, I'm not blaming you.
We never should've tried this.<eos> My little Rosaleen's already suffered enough from the loss of her daddy.<eos> I should've just accepted our fate and not burned up what little time we got left.<eos> Ladies,<eos> I beg of you, go home and use what little time you have left to say a proper goodbye.
It would start with the doctors and the nurses.<eos> The ones caring for you. They'd go home to their families, kiss their kids good night, pass on the virus.<eos> The next day at school, those kids would infect others, and in two weeks' time, this virus is in the general population.<eos> In four weeks, every major city on this planet.<eos> So, no, we're not evacuating you.

Miyamoto.<eos> Shigeru Miyamoto.<eos> I think... I think you know who Shigeru Miyamoto is.<eos> But I'd go all the way back to MIT, the guys who did Spacewar, John Carmack.<eos> Hideo Kojima, I'm telling you right now, brilliant.
Self-righteous do-gooding skell huggers.<eos> Always bad-mouthing us like they're such freaking angels.<eos> Please.<eos> As mayor of this great city, I swear to you, the perpetrators of this heinous crime will be captured and will be punished to the fullest extent.<eos> I swear that to you.
Are you all right?<eos> I think so, but it hurts.<eos> Oh, great, now we're really fucking trapped in here.<eos> You have to go and get help.<eos> I'll find someone to get you out.
Do you remember Louise Perroux'?<eos> She stuttered.<eos> Yes.<eos> You ran after her for months.<eos> - I caught you together once.
Given his medical history, he scarcely looked at him before signing the death certificate.<eos> Do you have anything to say about that'?<eos> The investigation... confirmed that the doctor was away that night.<eos> A fortunate absence for someone who wanted to get rid of the pharmacist... and make people think he had died from another of his attacks.<eos> At the funeral everyone knew about the two of you... and watched you both while... they looked at your wife with pity.
There's kind of an emergency.<eos> - Vomit in your victrola.<eos> - Oh, fuck! That's an antique!<eos> Most victrolas are antiques.<eos> I'm just gonna purel this bitch right quick, and, um, I'll find you.
No!<eos> No!<eos> How did we capture him?<eos> I don't remember.<eos> Moloch brought you here for one final mission, to tell me where to find Franklin's key.
- Mm-hmm.<eos> The guy you called a [bleep]?<eos> Yes.<eos> Well, if you guys ever need tickets, let me know.<eos> I'll hook you up.
Dad?<eos> Hi.<eos> I love you.<eos> I know. I know.<eos> I just wanted you and Mom to know how much I love you.
What's going on?<eos> Where's Hetty? She asked me to brief you.
Good one, Jillian.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> No, this is too easy.<eos> You guys are smarter than this.<eos> You wanted me to catch you here.
Well, I was gonna ask you the same thing.<eos> - Yeah, sure, you're fine, until I mention Caffrey's name.<eos> Then, you look like you wanna punch a hole through the wall.<eos> It's not that obvious, is it?<eos> Not to anyone else here, but I've known the both of you long enough to tell when something's up.
And this...<eos> Is for my girl!<eos> Take care of this one.<eos> I'll handle the endomorphe.<eos> I'll send you all to your graves!
I'm sorry, colonel Hank.<eos> We was just gonna go for a ride, as a joke, but then we saw this dude collapse in the street.<eos> Let's get you inside.<eos> Come on, buddy.<eos> So that C.P.R. class you did today... Actually turned you into heroes.
You found it.<eos> Hey, Alex.<eos> This isn't as pretty as the front.<eos> We got nothing to hide, but welcome wagon is a whole lot nicer.<eos> Alex will take you, ask you a few questions. Uh, but first, we need to see everyone's weapons.
- Take as many as you like.<eos> - Don't indulge him, but, yes, please take a birdhouse, all of you.<eos> And tell all your friends. I make 'em custom.<eos> You're delusional, don.<eos> I'll grab the insurance card and be right behind you.
I'll make sure this guy gets buried.<eos> You hear that?<eos> Are you listening?<eos> Hey.<eos> That's the kind of effort that'll get you into my unit.
Do they realize how insane that is?<eos> His innocence can't be considered?<eos> I just want to say... I didn't do it.<eos> You're killing an innocent man here tonight.<eos> Even God won't forgive you for this.
People can't focus and tell the truth.<eos> It's unbelievable.<eos> By the way, we never found out how Pierce died.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I can't believe I didn't tell you yet.
And an eyewitness who saw you pull the trigger.<eos> What?<eos> Hang on...<eos> Are we talking about Sass here?<eos> Did she put you up to this?
Uh, no, we're just, uh...<eos> - Is there someone who works here?<eos> - Well, Candy's in back.<eos> But if you change your minds, you're welcome to join in.<eos> Can I help you?
So we're announcing today that INXS are officially heading overseas.<eos> But you're not even the biggest band in Australia.<eos> I can see Chisel or the Oils trying this, but you?<eos> Oh, piss off, Lee.<eos> Why would the Yanks take you seriously?
I've got some bad news.<eos> DHS is outside and they've come for Will and Hash and Sudonym.<eos> What?<eos> How did they find us?<eos> I turned you in.
I got food in my fridge older than most of you.<eos> Now, all take-offs and landings occur in and around whatever godforsaken place we're at war with that day.<eos> That's 'cause these things are a bitch to take off and land.<eos> So once they're airborne, that's when we take over.<eos> And these gentlemen here are gonna take you through the nuts and bolts of exactly how we do that.
This is the Taechang.<eos> Patrol ship is making its rounds.<eos> This is the Junjin.<eos> Where exactly?<eos> What brings you all the way to international waters?
- We got to stop him, sensei.<eos> - I told you, he is too powerful... Even for me.<eos> - But, master splinter, If there's one time we could use your help, it's now.<eos> - Enough!<eos> I will not put you in danger again.
That's... What I'm doing here, too.<eos> Isn't this the cheese steak line?<eos> Eddie's been asking about you.<eos> Come with us. Yeah.<eos> Okay. You go ahead, and I'll catch up with you in a second.
- Ask mom.<eos> I've got some new wrestling moves.<eos> Ask mom.<eos> You're gonna love them.<eos> The hulkster can't hear you!
I've got some new wrestling moves.<eos> Ask mom.<eos> You're gonna love them.<eos> The hulkster can't hear you!<eos> The hulkster can't hear you!
Ask mom.<eos> You're gonna love them.<eos> The hulkster can't hear you!<eos> The hulkster can't hear you!<eos> The hulkster can't hear you!
Aw, what's all the fuss?<eos> I just took my pants off.<eos> No, no.<eos> You two need to talk.<eos> And I'm not letting you out until you air your dirty laundry.
Just let her go.<eos> Errol, can't you see I'm like you?<eos> Stay out of my head.<eos> You lied to us.<eos> I know I let you all down.
But that's all this was.<eos> I'll tell you what.<eos> I'll dig a little deeper.<eos> See what I can find.<eos> And if I come up with anything further, I'll reach out and I'll let you...
- I imagine it must be difficult for you...<eos> - Oh, there's John.<eos> I should go.<eos> We still have a lot of boxes to unpack.<eos> Well, unfortunately, I don't have a prayer to help you with that.
Are you receiving me?<eos> I repeat, we've lost sight of the car.<eos> Are you receiving me?<eos> Fantastic, Neuhart!<eos> Gendarmes saw you while you were in radio contact.
She had to be more discreet with the other servants.<eos> Hadn't you better go up to London and put her out of her misery?<eos> Oh, don't tempt me... because I know this: If I weaken, I'll pay for it.<eos> This sounds very like the kind of boys' talk I do not allow.<eos> If you can both tear yourselves away from your smutty deliberations, I need you both upstairs.
However, there are certain overtures that need to be made if we are to find a degree of peace.<eos> Welcome to my home.<eos> I wouldn't be here if Hayley hadn't forced the issue.<eos> Yes, it's rather unlikely that you'll experience an outpouring of kind sentiment here.<eos> The vampires in particular view you as well, barbaric.
I'm going up against armed suspects with you.<eos> I want to know the situation.<eos> I take pain meds, but they aren't as strong as they used to be.<eos> Codeine pills instead of morphine patches, I know.<eos> I researched you all before you arrived.
And here, I always thought a hero was defined by Awesome powers and a cool name...<eos> Ah, well.<eos> Down you go.<eos> Well, hulkees, I guess that's it for our show!<eos> See you next time!
On the rear quarter panel.<eos> You will have difficulty seeing the note the driver left, because there wasn't one.<eos> The world is going to hell.<eos> Absolute hell.<eos> Don't let Kim's double thumbs-up in the photos fool you.
Okay, what's your offer?<eos> $800,000.<eos> With punitive.<eos> You're... offering us $800,000?<eos> No, we're suing you for $800,000.
We'll see you in court.<eos> Uh... Alicia, we can't make money on this.<eos> Yes, we can.<eos> Have you rethought your position?<eos> Yes. We'll see you in court.
Dude, you are really crazy, man.<eos> I'm up out of here.<eos> Go.<eos> Fine. You can all leave!<eos> Like I need of you anyways!
If you want, I can, like, hold your hand right through this stuff. Hmm?<eos> Hey, look, Harvard, man, we are so sorry...<eos> Told ya.<eos> You guys were right.<eos> I needed you all along.
How do you plan on getting us the supplies?<eos> I mean, not to underestimate your men's capabilities, but it's highly unlikely they're going to be able to identify what we need.<eos> We can knock an ICBM out of the sky.<eos> I think we can handle this.<eos> An officer will escort you both to CIC.
Only real problem is that outcropping, probably coral.<eos> It may give us a tight squeeze.<eos> Yeah, we'll have to blow the coral to get a clean path.<eos> Hang on.<eos> I'll take you to the surface.
- We ask God for forgiveness.<eos> - Yes, Martin.<eos> That is why at your confirmation you confirm your faith in God.<eos> God confirms you are his children so you won't have to carry your sins alone.<eos> God helps you.
I will make sure you're both safe.<eos> Move on with your lives.<eos> Have your baby.<eos> Raise your family and wait.<eos> When this little girl is ready, she will find you.
They're terrible.<eos> No?<eos> No go?<eos> I ask all my patients.<eos> I have gathered you all here today because I have an announcement, a very big announcement about my future.
The rich are first in line.<eos> We can leave if you want.<eos> That's not necessary.<eos> But let me make something clear.<eos> I don't want to see you here when I get back.
Fine, but no leaving the premises.<eos> Okay.<eos> You need anything else?<eos> No.<eos> Um, I just wanted to tell you guys that I love you.
Essentially reintroduce her<eos> - to the country.<eos> - Randi loved malls.<eos> So what do you say?<eos> Are you ready for us to dig you out of the hole that Randi's little potty mouth has put you in?
Listen. Listen to me.<eos> I just want to get these girls out of here and Pete some help... that's all I want.<eos> You guys can get in your car and you can go.<eos> Hell, you can take my car.<eos> Ain't no one gonna stop you in that.
I broke up with someone.<eos> I think room number six is the room for you.<eos> Thank you. ‚ô™ Hold me close and hold me fast ‚ô™ ‚ô™ This magic spell you cast<eos> Kids, I must have heard your mom's rendition of "La Vie en Rose" a million times over the years.<eos> Every night when she tucked you in, for instance.
Let me finish!<eos> Avoid train stations and subway hubs.<eos> After 6 pm, take the bus instead.<eos> And don't cheat on the subway.<eos> They can deport you for a ticket.
When we were sitting there, I said, "look at them, here they come."<eos> I said, "just look at them shaking hands."<eos> "Just look at them over there!<eos> "And they're going to kick our ass and then talk shit about us."<eos> And I reminded them, I said, "if you shake hands, I'm going to hit you."
So they stopped talking to them.<eos> But that was my thing, trying to let my teammates know, that these guys are going to come in here and kiss your ass and kick your ass, and laugh at you.<eos> Our players were getting knocked down, getting hit and everything, but the other starting pitchers from our team wasn't doing nothing from retaliation.<eos> Dock walked out and stopped at batting practice and said,<eos> "every one of you coming to the plate tomorrow, "every one of you coming to the plate tomorrow, I'm hitting you."
Now what I can promise you is that whatever we do from here on in, we will do together.<eos> And the chiefs and officers on this ship will share with you what we know... good or bad.<eos> Now... It has come to my attention that there's a group of you who may no longer wanna continue on with this mission.<eos> Your enlistments are up.<eos> I will not hold you here.
- Outstanding.<eos> Thank you.<eos> If anything should happen...<eos> Finish what we started.<eos> The Russians are picking you up in one of their helos out in the middle of nowhere, taking you to their ship.
For what. The deal's done.<eos> I'm not sure. But my boss wants me to bring you two.<eos> Who's he?<eos> Take Mina and run.<eos> My boss says to bring you right now.
I'll miss only one thing.<eos> A face.<eos> My daughter's face.<eos> My wife's.<eos> I'll ask God... if you have children... that He help you... understand my pain.
I can't blame her.<eos> My skin was crawling.<eos> It's okay, he can play all the games he wants.<eos> The jury's not gonna fall for it.<eos> Eating together across from the courthouse when he's accusing you of conspiring against him?
Until a sympathiser who knew the coast was clear let them out.<eos> It had to be utterly secret, so unless you were in on it, you wouldn't even know it was here.<eos> Then how did Mum find this one?<eos> The book.<eos> She was reading your Auntie Elspeth's book about historic Gloucestershire houses, trying to find out what, or who was haunting you.
We'll make an early start in the morning.<eos> Yes, the earlier the better.<eos> There's a warrant out for your arrest.<eos> Back from the dead.<eos> I'd ask you to join me for a bite to eat but I've decided to dine in my room.
Yeah, well, I've picked up a thing or two.<eos> Hi. NYPD. We need to speak with Matilda King.<eos> Do you have an appointment?<eos> D... oh, I think you missed the part about the NYPD.<eos> Please. I just took over this desk this morning. She's going to freak out if I add you to the schedule.
I have to stop you because you can't. - "I have to stop you"!<eos> - You can't smoke here. - It's all inflammable.<eos> - Mattia! - Absolutely forbidden.<eos> All right, maybe we can sort out the lodgings problem later.<eos> You'll be wondering why I asked you all to come here.
All right, maybe we can sort out the lodgings problem later.<eos> You'll be wondering why I asked you all to come here.<eos> I know what you're up to.<eos> But really, Pietro, another demo by researchers on short-term contracts outside Parliament, - after the last beating we got...<eos> - No, Arturo. I didn't ask you here for yet another demo against research cuts.
Only me.<eos> The drivers always return the keys when they're done.<eos> So only you could have been driving this truck last night.<eos> Which I didn't, because I was asleep.<eos> Look, I can take you down to me property.
- Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Is he all right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> He says he loves you both.
Am I dealing with you?<eos> You know Jack's brought me on to represent him.<eos> Of course he has.<eos> Why shouldn't he have the best?<eos> You remember in '08 when I defended the two of you in that bribery case?
Coming down?<eos> Not to mention when you were a teen.<eos> Remember your behavior?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> When I'd pick you up at school, your mom would come.
Come on, come on up.<eos> - What can we do?<eos> - We got plenty of work.<eos> Trust me.<eos> God bless you, everyone.
Why not? I mean that's my plan. That's what I want to do.<eos> Let's just clean the world.<eos> So maybe the rest of us can sustain a little bit of life.<eos> So maybe that's what I'll do that in the future,<eos> I'll.. I'll help you out.
Homie, I think the kids are just hungry.<eos> Glasses, direct me to the nicest restaurant I can afford.<eos> Accessing soup kitchens.<eos> What, you...<eos> Oh, that's it, I'm taking you off.
Sir.<eos> Sir.<eos> Sir.<eos> Thank you.<eos> God bless you ma'am.
They told us, "You're leaving...<eos> We're sending you to university.<eos> To the best university in the world!"<eos> You have to follow all orders given to you.<eos> If you attempt to escape, they'll kill you.
[Gouby speaking French] We are going to Kibati actually.<eos> It's a bit further.<eos> Sorry, is there a problem?<eos> [Mitamba speaking Swahili] I'll start by calling the names.<eos> If you hear your name, move aside with your belongings and children so that I can see you.
God is not here.<eos> Well, that whole trip was pointless.<eos> Yeah, plus I left my Jacuzzi on the whole time, came home to a boiled raccoon.<eos> You guys, I feel terrible.<eos> I'm sorry I dragged you around the world looking for God.
If they say something you disagree with, let's time how long you can smile politely.<eos> I'm not gonna change how I am just to impress a couple of strangers.<eos> Sounds like someone doesn't think they can win.<eos> Oh, hey. I'm Trista.<eos> Listen, Will was just giving me a long list of subjects not to talk about, but listen, I'm gonna tell you anyway.
- You know, ugly things.<eos> - Why would you do that?<eos> Because it's the right thing to do.<eos> Look, he's still your grandfather.<eos> You know, he still loves you.
If you want to get home before Tristan slaughters your people, this is the only way.<eos> Clarke!<eos> The carts.<eos> What the hell is this?<eos> Tunnel on the right will lead you to the woods near your camp.
- Why are you doing that?<eos> It's called alliteration.<eos> It makes language more colorful.<eos> My point is... cut it out!<eos> It's unbecoming for your troops to see you like this.
I'm sorry.<eos> That sounded important.<eos> We're this close to signing a deal to turn Lori's books into a TV series.<eos> Damn vultures wanted to close on the deal today.<eos> How can I help you?
I mean, that's... that's tragic. Mm-hmm. You guys want a coffee?<eos> Yes, please.<eos> There he is.<eos> Excuse me. Mr. Hess?<eos> Can I help you?
Our enemies must not win, or we shall face extermination in our district.<eos> We must work hard and protect each other.<eos> We must train hard and be killers to defend the world.<eos> For is it not! who can only promise you security?<eos> Is it not I who put a roof on your heads..,.. feed you, nurture you ?
It requires a licence which you don't have.<eos> It was sold to me as a non-working antique.<eos> I can tell you the name of the shop I got it from.<eos> This was reported stolen from the IT storeroom at your place of work.<eos> Again, I don't mean to be rude but I have already explained to you gentlemen, it appeared one day in my office.
You haven't talked to her, have you? No, sir.<eos> I thought we were here because...<eos> Don't say anything, Katherine.<eos> Not a word.<eos> I don't know why you thought we brought you in.
- He still wants to cut off your dick.<eos> So, is that really what this is, a visit?<eos> Is that so inconceivable?<eos> Hey, you know what I was thinking?<eos> Come this weekend, how about I take you both to Cedar Point?
You know, it's a dangerous road to be travelling at night.<eos> You know what happens around here, missionaries?<eos> We're just trying to make Reynosa, hop across the border by sunrise.<eos> Yes, yes.<eos> But who will protect you lambs in your journey, huh?
My son found out he was skimming every week.<eos> Instead of sitting down, owning up, face-to-face, he hit him in the head with a brick and ran like a pussy.<eos> New deal.<eos> You're both under arrest, since you're a fugitive. You're a dick.<eos> Let KSP send you back to North Dakota, work it out.
Release all the rioters.<eos> Yes.<eos> Get up.<eos> Up.<eos> Governor is setting you free.
It was a trick.<eos> She was toying with us.<eos> Zelena sends a message.<eos> She will face Regina without interference!<eos> The next time you try to stop her, I will kill you.
Oh, my... you got to tell us about her, okay?<eos> How'd you two kids meet?<eos> Well, uh, I was just kind of hanging out on the beach one day, and this really beautiful lady wandered out of the ocean, and...<eos> I wanted to talk to her, but an evil queen stole her voice.<eos> Who introduced you?
They worry about us, and we worry about them.<eos> Sometimes, when I read their letters, it's as though they... were feeling... guilty for not being here... along with us.<eos> So they pray.<eos> They're always praying.<eos> I haven't introduced you yet.
- You can't say no to him.<eos> - We aren't done yet.<eos> He heard Lund's son was here.<eos> He should be in the movie.<eos> Anne-Lise will take you up. Okay.
And we promise you, we promise you half of whatever we find on our journey.<eos> Free of your chains.<eos> As all should be in the world I hope to see.<eos> How are you here?<eos> Where is the astrolabe to guide you safely through the storms?
Can I come with you?<eos> Jump in.<eos> Go on.<eos> We came here simply to consult the archives.<eos> The head monk refuses to see you.
Comrades, we are meeting here today to examine each other's failings.<eos> I forgot to set up the washing line.<eos> At the moment, I sing without ardor.<eos> That's good, Ly.<eos> ANGKAR congratulates you on your honesty.
Phnom Penh fell on April 17, 1975.<eos> In 3 days, they emptied a city of 2 million people.<eos> Those who stayed despite the war, expatriates, journalists, Cambodians wanted by the Khmer Rouge... They all took refuge at the French embassy.<eos> You're still here?<eos> I'll take you to the embassy.
This crime scene is now under CDC authority.<eos> Nobody touches that body.<eos> Barnes just released the four survivors.<eos> You don't need a cab.<eos> My driver will drop you off.
Yeah, "Winter's tale," Shakespeare.<eos> Bellwood players.<eos> I'm playing the lead.<eos> I guess you should've thought about that before you started playing automobile leapfrog.<eos> Okay, we'll get you into imaging.
But we're fine.<eos> Well, I'm here with representatives of the State Department.<eos> We're going to extricate you and the doc ASAP.<eos> But there's a snag.<eos> The Arquero police department has the two of you as persons of interest in the death Ana Ortiz.
I just wanted to make sure that no stone was left unturned.<eos> We have discussed this over and over.<eos> You promised you would let it go.<eos> And I will now that we know the truth.<eos> And the truth will set you free.
Hey, hey!<eos> Oh, no!<eos> - Woman: Hey! - Men:<eos> Everyone, get out.<eos> I don't want you here.
Sir has come.<eos> Good evening, Sir.<eos> This is Mattu !<eos> - Welcome, Sir!<eos> - God bless you.
Please marry Sarah and just be happy.<eos> Don't look at me.<eos> I'm sorry. I just forgot...<eos> I don't care what folks are saying.<eos> God will forgive you.
From X-Ray One, target and wife and children returning to car.<eos> It's going to be all right.<eos> OK? I promise.<eos> Everything's going to be all right.<eos> I'll see you again really soon.
Two thinnies sealed is not an accident.<eos> Someone did this.<eos> Who?<eos> Which one of you naughty little children figured out how to seal a thinny?<eos> Tell me, or you'll wish I tasered you again.
Darling, we discussed this.<eos> Are you going to come home?<eos> Yes, of course I am, darling.<eos> Then why do you need the photograph?<eos> So that I can look at you, and your mother and your brother when I'm feeling lonesome for you.
I have more money than you!"<eos> But instead, you quietly reached into your wallet and gave her your credit card.<eos> Then, when we were walking into the spa, I thought I spotted Mikayla's bike in the bushes.<eos> But sometimes I think I see Dan Rather at the Food Lion, so I don't trust my eyes.<eos> But what really gave you away was Debbie.
Get us there at least before you kick us off!<eos> Yeah, fuck you!<eos> Keep driving, asshole!<eos> Why are you shouting?<eos> As you're fucking me and calling me an asshole... I'll take you to Tai Po Centre
- What's wrong?<eos> - I'm sorry...<eos> Why are you crying?<eos> Actually, I've been bad<eos> I've been holding out on you all...
Get down now!<eos> Don't move.<eos> Don't move.<eos> Don't move!<eos> - The truth will set you free.
Knowing the sex makes this all too... real.<eos> It's not real enough for you?<eos> You've been farting like a lumberjack.<eos> We don't really need to know right now.<eos> Okay, I'll see you again in ten days.
- Uh, eikleberry.<eos> - Excuse you.<eos> - Uh, I got a cable installation.<eos> My client was given a window from 7:00 to 4:00. It's 5:15.<eos> Ride with me, and I'll fill you in on everything.
Then there's you, Bobby-- our fearless leader.<eos> Everybody knows it's the guilty man who tries to drink away his sorrows.<eos> Well, I guess it ain't working, Jake, 'cause I still got 'em.<eos> You know, what kind of a punk-ass asks his buddies to beat a man half to death, then takes his mask off so the dude can get a good look?<eos> I ain't gonna rat on you.
But I'll rip them off if you don't play ball.<eos> I'll put them on a necklace for you.<eos> Do what we're asking, and we'll leave you in peace.<eos> I can't.<eos> I've already told you.
Without Darius? You're gonna need him!<eos> What?<eos> Need him? For what?<eos> Need him for what?<eos> - To get you to Africa!
This has all been very weird.<eos> So, if you can give me the new route, we'll get out of here.<eos> Darius told me the way.<eos> Yes!<eos> And he made me promise to take you there.
2 minutes later, a yellow bird shows up!<eos> This is nonsense!<eos> Darius talked to you?<eos> What did he say?<eos> Well, he made me promise to take you to Africa.
By the way, I'm not sure if I can ask things like this...<eos> What is it?<eos> It's okay.<eos> Why did you get a divorce...<eos> I mean, when I saw you two last time, you looked really nice together.
He immigrated to this country 10 years ago, just after the murders.<eos> And when he did, the Green Dragon disappeared from Okinawa.<eos> That's what Jade was doing at the party. She was looking for proof that Saito was the Green Dragon.<eos> He got onto her and then he killed her.<eos> And then when you got close, he attacked you.
Oh, I've considered it plenty, my friend.<eos> No, Simmons will be fine.<eos> Just being realistic, kid.<eos> I never mentioned that.<eos> I'm telling you, killing her quick would be a mercy.
Then do your job.<eos> The work saves us, Trevelyan.<eos> It saves us.<eos> You are here to fight for King and country.<eos> Ireland spat you out.
Please don't hurt anybody.<eos> Everyone, move over there! Let's go!<eos> Down!<eos> Quiet!<eos> Move over here where I can see you!
LOOK, I'M JUST PROPOSING<eos> A DANCE-OFF,<eos> OKAY?<eos> A FAIR CONTEST TO SEE WHO'S REALLY THE BEST.<eos> HEY, I TOLD YOU BOYS,
We'll get you a case.<eos> Well, I appreciate that, Kenny.<eos> The pleasure's ours.<eos> Get that plastic mold fired up ASAP, huh?<eos> We figure with the amount of money you're spending, I can bump you to the top of the list.
- It's done.<eos> Aaron.<eos> We're really stuck.<eos> So if you could just please finish the code and write it in...<eos> Were you guys this incompetent when I hired you?
She... she misled us.<eos> All this time, she knew her boyfriend was going, and she kept it from us?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> She just found out Justin was going.<eos> She... she didn't mislead you.
I'm willing to try anything at this point.<eos> Yes!<eos> That is the kind of enthusiasm I like to hear.<eos> Come one, come all and witness the amazing airbenders!<eos> An airbending show that will leave you breathless with wind!
It's already late.<eos> You're right.<eos> I'm off now.<eos> Thank you, for lying-<eos> There are many people who saw two of you together.
It's too bad you're so stupid.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - Following Monroe.<eos> You don't know him like I do.<eos> The only place he's going to lead you... is into a grave.
Allison, we wanted to apologize for acting so bananas.<eos> You just have so much promise, we got excited.<eos> You're a good kid.<eos> And whatever you choose, you'll be great at it.<eos> I have to say I admire you both.
- River's half a click north, sir. All right.<eos> You guys get the civilian to safety.<eos> I'll cover your retreat.<eos> Alone, sir?<eos> I'll get up to the hills and meet you at rendezvous point Bravo.
I didn't invite any of you.<eos> I started with two cool people;<eos> I ended up with a bunch of grandpas.<eos> Listen, grandpas, when we get to the vineyard, there's gonna be a lot of fancy people there.<eos> Please, I beg you... don't embarrass me.
- Lina: I... Was showering.<eos> Russ: It's a very small shower.<eos> Receptionist:<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll... Doctor will see you shortly.
It was a blast, man.<eos> We even kidnapped somebody.<eos> Why would you go through all this trouble so Bobby and I would have fun?<eos> Well, I know you two have been having some problems lately.<eos> I thought going on a goofy, little adventure might bring you closer together.
__<eos> By the power vested in me by the great state of Oregon, I now pronounce you man and wife.<eos> Et cetera, et cetera.<eos> Or, if you prefer, husband and wife.<eos> Then we go for the kiss, or, I should say, the two of you go in for the kiss... After which I present you to the audience, and then you'll be happily married.
He keeps the glasses.<eos> Whatever you want.<eos> So unless anyone wants to run it again?<eos> No, I think we're good.<eos> Then I'll see you tomorrow.
It's a special occasion.<eos> I mean, my baby sister doesn't get married everyday.<eos> Okay, red or white?<eos> Red.<eos> All right, I'll see you all in the morning.
I had the ring.<eos> I was just about to, and that's when my mom showed up with Adalind and the baby, and...<eos> Nick, Juliette.<eos> Is this the most wonderful day or what?<eos> Hey, I'll see you both inside.
Probability's a really tricky subject.<eos> People find it unintuitive and difficult, and that's because, I think, it is unintuitive and difficult.<eos> But it's really worth struggling to try to work out the approximate rough answer to things that might happen in the future.<eos> David feels modern society overreacts to bad luck.<eos> Unusual events will get a great deal of media coverage, which can make people believe riding a bicycle will kill you.
You can't just keep going on and pretending everything's okay.<eos> Everything is okay.<eos> Okay, Defiance, I hope you brought your party slippers because Treasure Doll is here bringing you, Casti power pop from the hot new band, "Strength in Numbers"<eos> Oh, lunch looks delicious.<eos> You guys would forget to eat if I let you.
What did he say?<eos> I don't speak Spanish, dude.<eos> My name is Sir Malachi.<eos> I am the one who changeth your clue.<eos> I am the one who broughteth you here.
Every hour, every day.<eos> All that changed the day I was feeding the birds on my roof.<eos> I donned fair cloak and wizardly hat, to become Sir Malachi, the sparrow Wizard.<eos> I went into the sewers to play a solo larping game of Mazes Mutants.<eos> When I accidentally found you.
Just don't expect me to save you again, okay?<eos> Sam, what are you doing?<eos> Finishing what they started.<eos> And making sure that no one leaves.<eos> Which now includes you.
- Axl.<eos> - Hey! Stop talking to me!<eos> - Yeah, we're not doing that anymore.<eos> - Fine. If you're not willing to give me the reward that's rightfully mine, I will just have to come up with something of equal or greater value.<eos> Okay, from now on, I will listen to you provided you address me as "Sir Axl, Duke of awesomeness."
Captain!<eos> I hate to be harsh, but I think that these drills are slightly unnecessary, possibly. Although you are the boss, and your judgment is impeccable. And I guess what I am trying to say is thank you.<eos> I agree, with the stuff about the drills, not the spineless ass-kissing.<eos> Sir, I think it would help if we knew why we were doing these drills.<eos> Because I ordered you to.
She wants to kill Joe.<eos> We can't take her back.<eos> Joe said to call, Emma.<eos> We got to call.<eos> You hurt me, Joe will kill you.
Nice to meet you.<eos> Good bye, Carl.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What?<eos> Oh, Dorn sent you two to finalize the deal, huh?
Just give her a chance to talk.<eos> I just truly don't think that there is anything to worry about anymore.<eos> So Daphne kept this from us too?<eos> That is my fault.<eos> I told her that I was gonna talk to you.
You have a god in this fight, Harold, and she's fighting for her life.<eos> I wouldn't know.<eos> She only talks to you, Ms. Groves.<eos> Just because you stopped listening to her doesn't mean she isn't looking out for you.<eos> This job, your identity, is her keeping you alive.
It's the happiest moment of my life.<eos> I'll send my condolences to the bride-to-be.<eos> That kind of sense of humor is exactly what I want of my best man.<eos> Louis, are you asking me to be your best--<eos> Harvey, before you answer, I am sorry my fight with Scottie put you in a bad situation.
What?<eos> That's how we found them.<eos> You know, but the...<eos> The FBI has been...<eos> Has been searching for you for years.
Oh, my baby, are you hurt?<eos> Mom, I'm fine.<eos> I protected him.<eos> Nobody makes Nate a bitch on my watch.<eos> I can't believe they put both of you in with just a bunch of filthy, lowlife criminals.
Why are we even bothering with these idiots?<eos> We're shipping out to Afghanistan tomorrow.<eos> You guys are soldiers?<eos> It's our third tour of duty.<eos> If I could touch my own head, I'd salute you.
We're shipping out to Afghanistan tomorrow.<eos> You guys are soldiers?<eos> It's our third tour of duty.<eos> If I could touch my own head, I'd salute you.<eos> With his head, I salute you.
There's not going to be any trouble, right?<eos> No, don't worry.<eos> Aren't you going to give me a card?<eos> I don't use them, sorry.<eos> Ok, I'll leave you to yourselves.
Sam's been expelled.<eos> What?<eos> They're saying you falsified Sam's application?<eos> Yeah, when he applied, we checked off "Boy," not "Girl."<eos> But the principal knew what you were doing, and she supported you.
Cruise!<eos> Cruise.<eos> Cruise...<eos> Welcome aboard the Wave Dancer, your home for the next five days.<eos> I am your captain, Jan Nortis, and I invite you to dance on the waves with me.
Maybe we should settle this in court.<eos> Wait a minute!<eos> You want to settle this, you don't want this video shown in court, then take 20 cents on the dollar.<eos> Like hell I will.<eos> Then we'll see you in court.
But you can't keep this a secret forever.<eos> Jake hasn't been living at home for weeks.<eos> But we've been very careful.<eos> He's always home before the kids get up.<eos> But nobody sees you together.
Do I look like someone who jokes?<eos> Relax, relax.<eos> You guys got no sense of humor.<eos> Do you remember the fricking mess you were when you came to me?<eos> I didn't seek you out.
I haven't been beyond the stream near my church more than a few times since it all started.<eos> That was the furthest I've gone before today.<eos> Or maybe I'm lying.<eos> Maybe I'm lying about everything and there's no church ahead at all.<eos> Maybe I'm leading you into a trap so I can steal all your squirrels.
The people you're looking for are gone!<eos> I'm a detective from the International Criminal Court and I'm asking you to stand down.<eos> I'm going to disarm myself.<eos> If you do anything here, you'll be shooting one of your own first!<eos> I'm begging you... lower your weapons and stand down!
What the hell is that?<eos> I'm authorized, I completed the training.<eos> You shouldn't be carrying it.<eos> This is an unauthorized assembly.<eos> The college has warned you before.
No, you won't.<eos> You won't do anything.<eos> My son, Dante's father, was shot to death 22 years ago, and you people never found his killer, and my other son was murdered 7 years later, and nothing happened.<eos> And now Dante.<eos> The police come by once, and I never see you again.
I...<eos> "We do die, but we can return.<eos> The few, the very few, those who possess the will and strength of purpose, the self-chosen ones,<eos> Qui Reverti.<eos> This book will guide you through the prison doors back to freedom.
Well, you're good parents.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You're back.<eos> We're back.<eos> God knows I love you.
But we don't see ourselves that way.<eos> No one risks their life for some lord's strategy.<eos> We do it for those we love, for our brothers-in-arms, and so we don't look like cowards.<eos> And for money.<eos> I don't view you as chess pieces.
No.<eos> God, no. Uh...<eos> No, I was thinking...<eos> Saul Berenson.<eos> But you said he visited you today.
No, I was thinking...<eos> Saul Berenson.<eos> But you said he visited you today.<eos> Yeah.<eos> To see if I was advising you.
- Agent Thoms?<eos> - Ma'am, are you safe?<eos> If you're asking if this was my idea, the answer is "yes."<eos> Then please ask Mrs. Diehl to pull over.<eos> We have a vehicle on the way that will return you to the compound.
No.<eos> I really should get going.<eos> You've given me a lot to think about.<eos> Not the easiest conversation I've ever had.<eos> I think they're waiting for you.
Welcome, Madam President-Elect.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So, let me ask you what everyone is asking right now-- why are you here?<eos> Because you invited me.<eos> Well, I've often invited you, but, usually, you prefer the loving arms of the mainstream media.
Yes.<eos> Run out of this studio.<eos> You didn't just produce the lying video.<eos> You faked the hate and the lies that accompanied it.<eos> People hate you, Madam President-Elect.
How's it feeling?<eos> Can you wiggle your fingers, make a fist?<eos> Good as new.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Miss Durst, I'm sorry if this seems inappropriate, but when you came in last month to get the cast, one of the orderlies, he said he saw you in the parking lot before you came in.
I'll be in and out, I swear.<eos> I really need this job.<eos> - Um... - I'm begging you.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Okay. - God bless you!
Do you know why I pulled you over tonight?
Beautiful.<eos> Just tell them you forgot your ball.<eos> Tony: Absolutely no balls.<eos> We'll see you soon.<eos> Woman: All righty, so Dr. Kruskal will see you in a few minutes.
Why, Lieutenant Fitzgerald.<eos> What in heaven's name are you doing here?<eos> I thought you'd be off doing military maneuvers or something.<eos> What brings you to town?<eos> I'm looking for you.
But you will.<eos> I'm Vanessa.<eos> I'm your greatgreatgranddaughter.<eos> How can I possibly be related to you?<eos> I've never met you before in my life.
So, how are you? Oh, I'm good.<eos> Erm, well, I'm a bit tired.<eos> I think maybe the flight's caught up with me.<eos> Erm, Catherine was just about to take me to my room.<eos> But maybe Humphrey can show you.
So, let me get this right.<eos> You saw this as your ticket out of here and convinced Stephen to give you the credit for his work?<eos> I wouldn't put it quite like that, but, yes.<eos> Stephen was happy to help.<eos> Not sure why, but I wouldn't have imagined you as a smoker,
This is him.<eos> I can tell.<eos> I remember he had nice eyes.<eos> Nice eyes?<eos> The guy who held you at gunpoint?
A few months.<eos> The prosecution could try to claim you were lying about the whole thing, that you and Selway had consensual sex and you were spinning Costley a yarn to get him into trouble.<eos> Why the hell would Yvonne do that unless she was a lunatic?<eos> Ah, who knows?<eos> You were annoyed with Selway because he didn't call you afterwards, de-da, de-da, the usual.
Your friend's getting her belongings back.<eos> - What?<eos> - Why?<eos> I just received proof that you were not in Rosewood on the night that Dunhill disappeared.<eos> A redlight cam caught you fullfrontal in Keene, New Hampshire.
This report, and you went ahead and signed it, even though you knew it was fake and then passed it along to the police.<eos> - Is that the case?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Why?<eos> Did Mr. Chase threaten you?
Great minds, it seems.<eos> Hardly.<eos> I'm on a fungi hunt.<eos> And they are elusive little beasts.<eos> Oh, well, perhaps you need a knight to aid you in your quest.
You are young and, dare I say, sheltered.<eos> This dinner of Father Brown's, it's highly inappropriate.<eos> I take people as I find them.<eos> And aside from being partially clothed, I found them to be perfectly charming.<eos> Well, it is they who have charmed you.
Very well, I'll do the dirty deed.<eos> You've been avoiding me.<eos> I know why.<eos> You do?<eos> My declaration was sudden and alarmed you.
The people who suffer under despots and prosper under just rule.<eos> The people whose hearts you aim to win.<eos> If you demand blind allegiance, I respect your wishes.<eos> Grey Worm can behead me or your dragons can devour me. But if you let me live, I will serve you well.<eos> I will dedicate myself to seeing you on the Iron Throne because I choose you.
Some call it murder.<eos> Others a public service.<eos> And after your controversial release from prison, you met your father,<eos> Elijah Van Dahl.<eos> A man whose identity your mother kept from you.
Please don't kill yourself with your own bullet.<eos> We wouldn't be able to conduct the final part of this experiment.<eos> Time for you to make a choice.<eos> In this vial, an antidote that will save Benji's life.<eos> In vial numero dos, poisonous gas that will kill you if you enter the room.
Well, it's important for us to release limited information into the public domain, in case it encourages any witnesses to come forward.<eos> We'd also like you to come in at 4pm today for your ABE interview.<eos> Right.<eos> If that's what you want.<eos> You're welcome to have Beth accompany you, if it helps.
I think.<eos> And I walked towards the voice.<eos> But you didn't recognise who it was?<eos> Well, I sort of assumed it was Ian.<eos> You didn't hear the person behind you before you were hit?
Thank you, Mike.<eos> I've seen enough.<eos> Let's go back to the White House.<eos> With all that's happened in the past few weeks, the President is thrilled to have a man of your experience stepping back into the role of Secretary of State.<eos> Thank you, Ms. Rhodes, But let me stop you right there.
He's one of your workers.<eos> His name is Bram.<eos> Bram Bowman.<eos> He's at the distribution center.<eos> We'll have someone drive you over.
I completely overreacted to the situation.<eos> I know you were just trying to do what's best for the children.<eos> And...<eos> Gracie misses you, and we'd love for you to come back to the house.<eos> I've actually been expecting you.
So, all that we shall ever be is this.<eos> What we are right now.<eos> Dearest Isabelle, I'm sorry I have not been in touch.<eos> I deeply, profoundly loved your mother.<eos> And I'm sure what you would really wish for me to say is that, well that, I love you too.
About your business.<eos> You did this!<eos> You... .. evil old cow.<eos> That's what they think!<eos> That's what everybody calls you behind your back.
You mind if we pop over to your house and take a look at that brand-new computer of yours?<eos> I had pictures on that laptop... of my boyfriend and me.<eos> Pictures he promised to give back.<eos> "He"?<eos> He the person that was blackmailing you?
Hey, hey, gang's all here.<eos> Maybe we can win an election for a change.<eos> - That came out wrong.<eos> - Yeah, way wrong, right?<eos> So, Secretary Doyle has picked you for elder statesman duty?
-It was a surprise for everyone. -[chuckles]<eos> My son usually asks me for advice when he has to make an important decision.<eos> It's obvious he didn't think this one was so important.<eos> Or perhaps he didn't need your good advice.<eos> -I suppose this has taken you by surprise.
You cannot protect him.<eos> Now, I'm gonna give you one more chance to tell me the truth.<eos> Or else I'm gonna have to do something that... That I've never done before.<eos> And that's to call ICE.<eos> They're gonna send you back to El Salvador.
- Sit down. Stop!<eos> - Mom.<eos> - Hey, honey, it's okay.<eos> It's all right, okay?<eos> You want your kid to see you like this?
- Mary Cooper, fuck off!<eos> This lady's been waiting to see you.<eos> I trust there is no trouble with our business.<eos> None.<eos> Then what in the name of all sense brings you here?
Stop pretending you're still a lady.<eos> That went up your arse with the prick of that rake you ran away with.<eos> No more county balls for poor Miss Pettifer.<eos> Only hairy ones now.<eos> I hope he strangles you next time.
You call yourself a man of faith?<eos> You are knowingly sending an innocent girl to her death.<eos> Come.<eos> Examine her handiwork and tell me she deserves anything less.<eos> Do you think your co-conspirator loves you?
But a baronet is dead so someone will have to.<eos> What did the magistrate say to you?<eos> Nothing I didn't already know.<eos> Mrs. Wells, I need to speak to you in private.<eos> Harriet, if I hear one more word about your children, I swear I'll put you out that door.
Your company.<eos> Charlotte Wells!<eos> Charlotte Wells!<eos> Charlotte!<eos> What possesses you to come here with this witch?
Charlotte Wells!<eos> Charlotte Wells!<eos> Charlotte!<eos> What possesses you to come here with this witch?<eos> She'll lock the doors and keep you here by force!
Or is she still locked and beaten in your crypt?<eos> If you thought Miss Lacey was in danger... why did you tell me where to find her?<eos> Hello, grunt.<eos> Where's the shewolf?<eos> I'm going to get the law on you for kidnapping Emily Lacey.
She knows.<eos> What did you tell her?<eos> Nothing.<eos> She knows.<eos> Straightaway you conclude that I betrayed you?
I went to the courthouse this morning.<eos> I meant you no ill will.<eos> I was forced.<eos> Don't drink it.<eos> In return for my life, Justice Cunliffe told me to bring you here.
I have to say it's been¬ê¬ê I don't know¬ê¬êit's been years since I've come across a student as promising as your daughter.<eos> ¬ê That's great.<eos> That's really great. ¬ê I'm sorry.<eos> Did¬ê¬ê.<eos> Have I upset you?
Help... Help me.<eos> Please.<eos> Like you helped that kid in the incinerator.<eos> Or anyone on Eros.<eos> And you expect us to help you?
- No, I can't.<eos> Ma'am, actually, I gotta talk to you.<eos> I got another call from the publisher.<eos> We need to buckle down and start writing the book, okay?<eos> What if we started with when Hughes selected you as his veep?
- I need breakfast.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Oh, can you help me up?<eos> - Sure. Here, okay.<eos> I'll... I'll get you from the back.
- Damn it, I'm roaming. - I can't afford to roam!<eos> - We got it, we got it.<eos> Nyaring Ayun, women's rights dissident from... get this... the Sudan!<eos> Oh, really?<eos> Yeah, she's currently under house arrest for opposing the very warlord who photobombed you.
That's perfect. - All right.<eos> God, why am I downloading a movie?<eos> Gary? I can't get this...<eos> okay, something's...<eos> - Let's flip you over.
- Finally got Catherine down.<eos> - I could never get her down.<eos> She was always so scared about monsters everywhere, you know, under her bed and behind the curtain and in the closet.<eos> Although, actually, one time, Andrew did hide one of his women in the closet, so she had reason to be somewhat alarmed.<eos> - Why don't I join you in that nightcap?
- I'm sorry I'm late.<eos> You'll never believe what happened to me.<eos> My train literally went off the rails and the...<eos> I'm gonna cut you off here because I'm assuming you lived.<eos> Mr. Wayne is waiting for you.
I ran off, Carlota, as if he was the thief.<eos> -Go on, Marga, go.<eos> -No.<eos> -Look out.<eos> -Sorry. Sorry, miss, I didn't see you.
See?<eos> You're not gonna win with him.<eos> - So I'm discovering.<eos> - Look, I promise you, I will do everything I can to take it easy.<eos> Besides, last time I checked, I think I outrank you.
He'll be at your disposal.<eos> You'll be provided with a secure office with secure communications.<eos> Nobody will know what you're doing.<eos> Understood? Yes, sir.<eos> Agent Wells, I hereby authorize you to use whatever means necessary, within the Constitution of the United States of America, to find the people involved in this conspiracy and bring them to justice.
Clearly, you're juggling a lot as first lady... Wife, mother, spokesman, role model.<eos> How do you keep it all together?<eos> Um I... I have to admit, it has been, uh... an adjustment with a steep learning curve.<eos> I mean, just yesterday, I managed to get in hot water for a comment I made at a luncheon.<eos> Senator Jack Bowman of Montana accused you of soft-pedaling gun control on behalf of the President.
- I saw it!<eos> This is an outrage!<eos> Close the curtains!<eos> Remove the wildlife!<eos> Why did I almost believe you? !
'Since your previous interview, 'we've uncovered some new evidence we'd like to put to you.'<eos> For the DIR, I'm showing Ms Reznikova item reference JHF-9, showing a DIY store car park and a figure wearing a balaclava.<eos> Yes.<eos> He looks like the man who attacked me.<eos> According to your witness statement, on the evening of the 9th of March, you were set upon by a man wearing a balaclava who forced you into his vehicle and transported you to an address on the Borogrove Estate belonging to Michael Farmer.
He was in custody at the time.<eos> We believe this must be Timothy Ifield.<eos> For the DIR, I'm showing Ms Reznikova item reference JHF-10, showing the same man purchasing a number of power tools.<eos> No, I don't know anything about this at all.<eos> Hana, we wonder if you have any idea at all why Timothy Ifield would be dressed exactly as you've described the man who abducted you five nights earlier?
'Tim Ifield was the Police Forensic Coordinator present on the scene' when you were rescued from Michael Farmer's house.<eos> You told us he came into the cafe where you worked and asked you to become his cleaner.<eos> Are you certain you didn't recognise him?<eos> I had never seen him before.<eos> He'd seen you.
I'm sorry, Hana, we really need to search your flat.<eos> Jodie, Section 18.<eos> Do it.<eos> DCI Huntley leaving the room.<eos> Hana Reznikova, I am arresting you in connection with the murder of Timothy Ifield.
Yes.<eos> What was he doing, getting her round his flat?<eos> This has come as a shock for all of us.<eos> Thanks for letting me in on this, ma'am.<eos> Look, I know we've had our differences, but for what it's worth I don't think they'd have replaced you as SIO if you were a bloke.
Finally.<eos> Stop!<eos> Ramse, stop!<eos> Why would Mr. Cole kill his brother, if not for you?<eos> Why would Ramse want to kill you, if not for his brother?
He didn't need to die.<eos> You manipulated him.<eos> You seem to care a lot about a german you killed.<eos> He was your first, wasn't he?<eos> And they sent you in to talk to me.
And don't leave anything out.<eos> Katherine found out about the affair.<eos> Relationships between the officers is strictly forbidden.<eos> And of course George is married.<eos> So she blackmailed you?
To be loved.<eos> To be wanted.<eos> To be seen.<eos> Thank you, Father.<eos> However... ..that leaves you with a difficult, ethical obligation.
I thought you made a decision or at least consult with him before you changed your mind.<eos> Okay, enough!<eos> Stop it, Owen!<eos> No more!<eos> All your pre-op tests came back looking terrific, so just two more things before we get you home for some much needed rest, okay?
If I'm able to get pregnant, I just want you to know that it will be because of you.<eos> This child is just as much yours.<eos> So, please, if you want to play a role in my child's life, I would do anything to make that a reality.<eos> This child needs to know love.<eos> Fuck you.
Now, remember the burden of proof on a grand jury is low.<eos> Your job is merely to indict, not to convict.<eos> So please keep in mind you don't need to believe beyond a reasonable doubt.<eos> You only need to believe that the accused... could have committed a crime.<eos> Miss Tascioni, this is an order from a federal magistrate compelling you to assist in our investigation.
This is abuse.<eos> Oh, dear God.<eos> Diane Lockhart. Ah...<eos> Thank God.<eos> Did Alicia call you?
I only know what I see in the dioramas.<eos> Why haven't you taken these premonitions to the police?<eos> I have. They looked at me like I'm crazy.<eos> That's why I came to you, Agent Keen.<eos> I saw you at the grocery store, recognized you from the news.
Put him on speaker.<eos> Detective, how can I help you?<eos> Ms. Webber, I'm reaching out regarding a homicide case I caught last night.<eos> The victim had your name and number in his recent calls,<eos> - which is why I'm contacting you.
Sound familiar?<eos> See, I know it can feel impossible at times, but I figured it out.<eos> I know what I'm doing, which is how I know that you do not.<eos> You do not know how to be married.<eos> N... Not to a real man, to someone who's your equal, your champion, who loves you and respects you, and is mad as hell at you, because I do.
Well, wouldn't be the first time he bought someone's silence.<eos> You have five seconds to tell me who you are.<eos> Put the gun away, Ms. Vaughan.<eos> Why would I do that?<eos> Because I'm not the only one following you.
But it will look even worse if you reopen a case based on circumstantial evidence.<eos> Nick, let us find out the truth.<eos> Let us finish what we started seven years ago.<eos> Why the change of heart, Ms. Vaughan?<eos> Did he threaten you?
Where were you Thursday morning, ten o'clock?<eos> - Church.<eos> - Last night?<eos> Church, too?<eos> Father Conlan says he hasn't seen you in weeks.
Justin can come with me to the Scratching Post.<eos> I need to find Clive.<eos> Why do I feel like I'm in trouble?<eos> Did you tell us everything the first time we talked to you, Piper?<eos> Because a witness puts you at Jamie's front door on the night of the murder.
You're so not in an open relationship that your husband hired a private investigator to find out what you were up to.<eos> Remember that Civic you saw following you on a date with Jamie?<eos> That was him.<eos> And it gets worse.<eos> Turns out your husband's P.I. was following you the night of the murder.
That was him.<eos> And it gets worse.<eos> Turns out your husband's P.I. was following you the night of the murder.<eos> That's who called your husband and told him where you were.<eos> That's how Will found you.
But it's not all bad news.<eos> Have you heard of Nasa?<eos> The space people?<eos> They're the ones.<eos> Now, as part of the space shuttle programme, they've developed a far superior plastic compound, one that won't kill you.
And if she is dead or in prison, she is no help to him.<eos> Do you see my problem?<eos> We wouldn't need much from you.<eos> What means "not much"?<eos> Well, an occasional question about how TASS works, maybe the name of an employee or two, who watches over you, if you know what I mean.
- You say the word, I hit "send."<eos> - Do it.<eos> I've been looking for investment opportunities.<eos> If you're confident, I'm confident.<eos> Because you know what I'd do to you if you blew my money.
That's not true.<eos> That product was<eos> You are not gonna weasel me this time.<eos> - I want my 35 grand.<eos> - Oh, just hold on. Would I come here, to your church, if I scammed you?
You see, when you're dealing with us, everything you see is real.<eos> Whenlaughinghyenas comeoutto play, allbetsareoff .<eos> Our particular breed of hyena, eat their own kind.<eos> Whatyoucall "amassacre", wecallit "fundayat thezoo ".<eos> He wants to blow you.
Hello.<eos> Hello.<eos> Evening, Monroe.<eos> Rose.<eos> Miss Moore, have I seen you in something recently?
Yes, I once played a waitress who handed you a tuna fish sandwich.<eos> Miss Moore's not an actress, Pat. Oh?<eos> Why the hell not?<eos> It's been done.<eos> I am glad he found you, Miss Moore.
Thank you so much.<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> No thanks necessary.<eos> Except, perhaps to agent Mojtabai.<eos> He was the one who recommended you.
- Of course.<eos> I'll go check on Clay.<eos> Ms. Barinov, I'm in the middle of something.<eos> Uh, I'm... I'm sure.<eos> I just wanted to give you a heads-up that one of our journalists is running a piece on Peggy Deagle, and she says you're old friends and mentioned you quite a bit in the piece...
Take a seat.<eos> I know you must be reeling from this news, and I appreciate you coming down here to see us.<eos> I'll tell you the reason that I'm here.<eos> We found Mr Byrden's phone.<eos> He called you four times on Thursday.
Nam?<eos> Water, please?<eos> You think you can cause havoc all over my city and not pay a price?<eos> You know, this is all a big misunderstanding.<eos> Until your government bails you out, you are my prisoner.
Remind me of a drill instructor I had in boot camp. - Nice guy?<eos> - Sweetheart.<eos> We'll start over here.<eos> First, I would like to hear about what's been happening lately.<eos> After that, I'm gonna send you down to phlebotomy so we can run a few standard tests.
Have you seen the papers?<eos> It's all eyes on us.<eos> The Times is saying the failures in Rochdale happened because police were scared of upsetting racial sensitivities.<eos> Well, if those men come back off bail and we can't charge them with anything, there's going to be riots.<eos> They don't know I'm meeting you, you know.
- How can you know that?<eos> - Because there's only six people capable of that kind of work, and if one of them did it, I'd know.<eos> - Well, they got it somehow, and I need to know how they did it.<eos> - That's not a hell of a lot to go on.<eos> - If I had more to go on, I wouldn't need you.
Any other family in the area?<eos> Parents?<eos> No, they're both dead.<eos> Can you please tell me what's gonna happen to me?<eos> Well, when we're done here, we'll be moving you to county jail in Kingston for booking.
All right.<eos> What about my husband?<eos> I've been here for hours, and no one has told me anything.<eos> I'm sorry, it's too late.<eos> We have to take you to county now.
I want to live up to your expectations sexually and...<eos> You know what I mean. You just have to make the article your own, Jane.<eos> You can't try to do what Sage does.<eos> Very people can do what Sage does.<eos> Mr. Grey will see you now.
I made a mistake.<eos> You have a good day, all right?<eos> Hey!<eos> How you doing, man?<eos> They'll always ignore you.
I need your help.<eos> But I wanna know if I can trust you.<eos> I'm kinda getting the idea that, you know, you might not have much choice.<eos> Well, my situation is very delicate.<eos> Hey, that's where I know you from, right?
You may speak freely in front of him, as he rarely understands a word.<eos> Holmes!<eos> However, before you do, allow me to make some trifling observations.<eos> You have an impish sense of humour, which currently you are deploying to ease a degree of personal anguish.<eos> You have recently married a man of a seemingly kindly disposition, who has now abandoned you for an unsavoury companion of dubious morals.
It's so long since we've been on holiday and we're anxious to be off.<eos> Besides, brahms seems so fond of you.<eos> I only wish we had an opportunity to, uh... To explain to you the vicissitudes of a child as unique as our brahms.<eos> But, uh, you'll pick it up, I'm sure.<eos> Oh, I've got something to, um, help you along.
Oh, don't worry.<eos> I'll take care of it.<eos> What if they say no?<eos> Are you really asking me that?<eos> Okay, so I'll tell him to expect you.
Hey, not your fault, little guy.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Aiden apologize to the lady.<eos> I'm sorry, ma'am.<eos> I didn't see you there.
No more, Father!<eos> You're killing him!<eos> I adjure you not by my weakness, but by the Holy Spirit, to depart from this servant of God.<eos> You've killed him.<eos> Miss Waters, Dr. Hawkins will see you now.
- Sergeant meadows, do you know what it's like to really suffer?<eos> You have to fight and fight until you're too exhausted to go on.<eos> Witchcraft is my religion, sergeant.<eos> And this religion, which is older than your Christianity, saved my life.<eos> - Ms. parks, I'm sorry if I've offended you.
- Oh, yes, of course.<eos> Uh, my late husband, Frank... they were very close.<eos> Randall.<eos> Frank Randall, of course.<eos> I remember you now, yes.
I should be gone an hour or two.<eos> That should give you plenty of time to strip and remake my bed to your satisfaction.<eos> Oh, Madame, you are too kind.<eos> Good morning, Madame.<eos> Your carriage awaits you.
Thank you.<eos> I could use a friend.<eos> Accept this mixture as my gift to you and your husband.<eos> Have him steep the infusion in a cup of tea before bedtime.<eos> I guarantee he will keep you awake all night with his snoring.
This is crap.<eos> Do I have to listen to this?<eos> Send me to the Principal's office.<eos> I can't listen to this anymore.<eos> Okay, we'll send you to the Principal's office 'cause you can't keep your mouth shut.
Hell with it.<eos> Come on. Shit.<eos> Let's do it. Let's go get 'em.<eos> I can't believe we're outside again.<eos> I'm gonna get you through this.
I thought I saw a tree move.<eos> I had to, captain.<eos> Mr. Godfrey wanted to use me as a convenience.<eos> I'm afraid my call of nature called rather loudly.<eos> I fear we mistook you for a Nazi spy.
I saw you out on the sands.<eos> It's frank.<eos> I know he's a silly boy, but he'll make a fine man one day.<eos> I love him, miss winters.<eos> Trouble is, he loves you.
- And the Horkheimer book?<eos> - The contract was signed.<eos> Through we do have doubts about an umpteenth text on the Frankfurt school.<eos> What's done is done.<eos> Christelle will contact you in September to finalize the layout.
And when they did that, I could see him through their eyes.<eos> But we knew we loved him.<eos> He died a long time ago.<eos> And that was when we realised how much he'd really mattered.<eos> God bless you, Sister. And him.
Might I say what lovely accents you young people have.<eos> Past tense.<eos> Oh, I've missed that sound.<eos> Glad you could make it, Tommy. Hola, Tommy! May I?<eos> I don't believe I've seen you here before?
Charming -- those were probably the evenings you spent with me.<eos> They weren't.<eos> Can I interest anyone in a barley sugar?<eos> Oh, yes, please!<eos> You know I rather envy you.
This is a respectable establishment.<eos> Miss Whitmore. - I've just paid next month's rent.<eos> - Which will serve in lieu of notice.<eos> Mrs Tucker, I don't have enough money...<eos> I'm sure your gentleman friend will help you out.
I'm sure your gentleman friend will help you out.<eos> You should be ashamed of yourself, you little madam.<eos> So should you, Mrs Tucker.<eos> At least I'm not a thief!<eos> I think you should ask Sister Julienne to take you off other midwifery duties until we know what this is.
I had a pair like that in El Alamein.<eos> I had a pair in Monte Cassino.<eos> No wonder we won the war!<eos> The place is upside down, Sister.<eos> I wasn't expecting you.
It's time to go, madam.<eos> Where's the captain?<eos> He received orders to proceed to Keswick, and he left during the night.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Captain has said I was to escort you to Bellmont before we rejoin him.
Connie!<eos> Ow. What happened?<eos> The building fell on us.<eos> How?<eos> Something came flying at the building, and I got you out of the way.
You should tell the group that.<eos> You really do care, don't you?<eos> I do.<eos> Let's go, Carl.<eos> It's not often I see a prisoner leave you speechless.
Carl, you can trust me.<eos> The guards established a fight ring and the convicts fight until they're broken.<eos> What happens to them after that, I don't know.<eos> That's why my face looks the way it does.<eos> And I may have dragged you into this bullshit unintentionally.
You can't trust anybody.<eos> I have worked here for years.<eos> I have to do something.<eos> Leave.<eos> Before this place turns you to salt.
He has several?<eos> So I assume you have his code for his private entrance.<eos> What private entrance?<eos> Don't say another word, Ms. Miller.<eos> I'm representing you now.
Table number seven, right?<eos> And then you started sleeping with him?<eos> But you still call him Mr. Stokes.<eos> And you can't even tell me about his private entrance.<eos> What do they have on you, huh?
The attacker. Who was he?<eos> I already told the other guy I don't know.<eos> You know, I helped you.<eos> I helped your partner.<eos> Luke helped you.
Do you love? Do you love?<eos> Come on. You're not gonna beg?<eos> Come on. Not even a little bit?<eos> If you gonna kill me, then just do it.<eos> What shook you?
If you gonna kill me, then just do it.<eos> What shook you?<eos> Was it losing your gun to one suspect while trying to arrest another without backup?<eos> Was it the extra eyes because of Scarfe? Was it this Luke Cage guy?<eos> What pushed you towards career suicide?
Own your shit.<eos> You went renegade when you went after Luke Cage alone.<eos> And it got... way deeper than it should have.<eos> And this guy took the control away from you when he took your gun.<eos> Then you're in a room alone with Miss Temple, and she insults you, and you lost control... and you know it.
Don't be ridiculous.<eos> That's a limited edition.<eos> I'm not even sure I'd be willing to sell that.<eos> I tell you what though.<eos> I'll trade you for the L6.
"After that, I passed out.<eos> "Strangely, so did my sister in the next room.<eos> "When I awoke, he was behind me, with no pants on.<eos> "I don't know what he did to us while unconscious."<eos> The neighbour with whom he cheated on you also came forward.
- She hasn't requested a lawyer, Roy.<eos> Senior Constable Fergus McFadden has just re-entered the room it's... 09:51.<eos> I hardly knew Chloe Holloway.<eos> She was a baby when I left.<eos> Is that before Roy smuggled you off the island?
"More this.<eos> Less that."<eos> But I certainly didn't wish any harm on him.<eos> Oh, I just feel woozy thinking about it. Ohh.<eos> Let me help you.
Yeah. The media made a request, And some idiot at county released them.<eos> First of all, he broke the back door down to get in.<eos> Okay, wait a minute.<eos> What is he doing?<eos> Is he threatening you?
Nice to meet you, Mr Oliver.<eos> Danny, ragtime.<eos> So, where were we?<eos> - Crimea.<eos> - I mean before I bored you with war.
Wil, it's a trap!<eos> Let him go!<eos> You didn't think this through, did you?<eos> Shut up.<eos> It appears I've underestimated you, young lady.
- Yeah, I got it.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> ‚ô™ Well, you know you're my only darling ‚ô™<eos> ‚ô™ You know you're my desire. ‚ô™<eos> (footsteps) Woman: Andy is ready to see you now.
I'm making breakfast.<eos> Are you very hungry...<eos> And is there anything for me?<eos> Something I will...<eos> When I got your letter, I assumed it was an invitation to come and see you.
You were brought up with the same freedom as my parents raised me.<eos> When we moved to Madrid and I was in that depression, you didn't say anything, But I stifled a tremendous sense of guilt For the death of your father and the man in the train.<eos> I always avoided talking about it, I wanted you to grow up guiltless.<eos> But you perceived it...<eos> And despite my silence, I ended up infecting you as if it were a virus.
He stopped them from killing us.<eos> Excuse me. Can you come with me?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Get dressed and go back to your cell.<eos> Mother, let her examine you.
And alcohol.<eos> Which for an addict with a history of...<eos> accidents.<eos> Is this supposed to feel like a cross-examination? It's not supposed to feel very nice.<eos> And if someone told you it would, they misled you.
Aside from the money wasted, and the embarrassment to our American friends, the debacle at the Turkish-Syrian border has put us back five years in terms of intelligence sourcing with Syria and the Middle East.<eos> I'm extending the meeting so we can fully explore the reasons why the operation went ahead with such poor and corrupted intelligence, and what lessons can be learnt to ensure this never happens again.<eos> What led you to believe that British arms were being exported under the counter through TradePass?
- Where is she?<eos> - In the entrance to the convent.<eos> I said that we're not going to pay and we're not going to pay.<eos> You all think you're so different with you "libert√©" and your "√©galit√©" and "fraternit√©" but after everything you're all the same - tyrants.<eos> - If the "empereur" weren't arriving I would send you to the firing squad with the other prisioners.
Maybe I did something wrong.<eos> And searching for those answers I heard God's call.<eos> Bastard!<eos> It's his fault you are here.<eos> You were there for him, at his beck and call, and he betrayed you.
- They're called antivirals.<eos> Mary, mother of God.<eos> - What a devilish name.<eos> - Don't worry.<eos> That will cure you.
Uh, uh, hold on.<eos> Hold on, I want to record this.<eos> It sounds an awful lot like you're asking for the day off after being three hours late.<eos> The truth is... I am so very sorry, Miss Grant.<eos> Because I respect you so much.
You must raise them.<eos> You must nurture their minds to grow into a Khan and a Queen of unassailable character.<eos> Go, Mother.<eos> To your Khan.<eos> He needs you now more than I.
He wanted this account kept confidential.<eos> Does anyone in my family have access?<eos> Not according to our paperwork, no.<eos> Then why are you calling me?<eos> Your father listed you as his trustee.
You been out here yet?<eos> It's nuts. Nuts tonight.<eos> Packed.<eos> You gonna tell me the good news, or no? Yeah.<eos> But it's good news, so I'm telling you at the bar with a drink in my hand.
I didn't do nothing.<eos> -Go down to the courthouse.<eos> -They must be so scared.<eos> Go down there.<eos> They'll help you.
And I have to let my scared little girl know that no one's taking her from her mom again, and I got to let my boy know that all of this wasn't his fault.<eos> So, maybe this is ending for you, but... It's not over for me.<eos> That's all I wanted to say.<eos> I'm not gonna get into a debate with you, Ms. Diaz.<eos> But if you believe you share no responsibility in the events that brought you to this courtroom, you are mistaken.
He's flown away<eos> She died<eos> It's the fault of my first disciple<eos> It was too wrong.<eos> He freaked you out
-Connie Frazier.<eos> Social Services.<eos> Ah, Social Services.<eos> My apologies.<eos> I didn't expect you so soon.
Were you one of the victims of his advances?<eos> What I say is to the Senate Judiciary Committee only, not for public consumption.<eos> Agreed.<eos> I wouldn't want it to appear that I had a political agenda.<eos> I'll make it clear. I came to you.
The message, Thomas is not a great candidate.<eos> Still, his nomination was sent to the full Senate, where it is all but certain that he will be confirmed.<eos> - Hello?<eos> - Professor Hill, this is Nina Totenberg from National Public Radio.<eos> I received a copy of the affidavit that you faxed the Judiciary Committee stating that Clarence Thomas sexually harassed you.
Friday?<eos> Senator, that's in three days.<eos> And I'm supposed to prepare and travel and...<eos> Don't worry about any of that.<eos> I got a great young staff, who are gonna help you out with everything.
I felt that I had to tell the truth.<eos> I could not keep silent.<eos> There's no way he survives this day.<eos> Professor, before I begin my questioning, I notice that you have a number of people here.<eos> You've got friends or family joining you here today?
I met him by chance.<eos> I wanted to see his friend.<eos> I told you he had nothing to do with it.<eos> We're changing doctors as well.<eos> I understand that girl haunting you.
As soon as I can, don't worry.<eos> See you later.<eos> - Don't go back to the cybercaf√©, OK?<eos> - Yes, I'm sorry.<eos> I called you because we may have found the girl's name.
You shouldn't be in the ghet--<eos> Get this, get that. Ge- - Um...<eos> You shouldn't be in this dorm.<eos> -Taystee! -Um...<eos> So, we've assigned you somewhere else.
And worst of all, the drivers are both abundant and abundantly irresponsible.<eos> While I appreciate your concern, I am certain I can hazard the Los Angeles driving conditions.<eos> Miss Carter, since our last adventure, my life has consisted of oiling floorboards, cleaning pools, and... Transporting exotic livestock.<eos> I'm profoundly and exhaustively bored.<eos> Please, at least until Mr. Stark returns, allow me to drive you around.
I don't wanna be with her.<eos> I tell you what, if you got one shoulder and we get pulled over by the cops, we're going to jail.<eos> We're going to jail.<eos> 'Cause everything you do is gonna come off as sarcasm.<eos> "Ma'am, do you know why I pulled you over?"
It was just like...<eos> I was trying to, like be... be like a...<eos> - I'm messing with you. - Huh?<eos> I had to get even with you for pranking me.<eos> - So had you. - For a second.
Ms. Groves has changed because of your intervention.<eos> Elizabeth Bridges.<eos> I'm afraid I'm going to have to kill her.<eos> But I didn't kill her.<eos> Only because I stopped you.
Your...<eos> My brain's been fried. I'm sorry.<eos> You're not the one who drilled into my head.<eos> But maybe I could've helped to stop it.<eos> You asked me if I even looked for you.
Mason went so far as to allege the deliberate manipulation of her diagnoses and prescriptions.<eos> Samaritan has been manipulating the entire health care system through the database.<eos> It's created the outbreak to target the three people with direct knowledge of its actions, but surely an outbreak is overkill.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Miss Groves, I'll get back to you.
_<eos> In each case, a single name was added to what I wrote.<eos> And each time, that name turned out to be the key to stopping a major terrorist attack.<eos> The only way to be that accurate is with illegal surveillance on a massive scale.<eos> After 9/11, the government wanted a system that could watch everyone and everything, and if I'm right, then somebody really built the damn thing, which is why I called you.
Well, I think we all face the same hopelessness, Mrs. Winchell.<eos> It's what we decide to do with it.<eos> You're right. So what are you gonna do?<eos> If you want to do your job, expel the bully.<eos> Focus on the kid who sings like an angel even though he doesn't need you.
Not like this one.<eos> Don't lose it.<eos> So what are you, SWAT?<eos> I mine data from the insurgency and look for ways to exploit it.<eos> How exactly did they rope you into doing that?
There is no reason to return him.<eos> We will not leave here until James Cole is returned.<eos> You have until dawn.<eos> The Emerson Hotel, Suite 607.<eos> The day he called you and you refused to help.
Why did you want it?<eos> We both know there are currencies stronger than money.<eos> Miss Carter, since our last adventure,<eos> I'm exhaustively bored.<eos> Allow me to drive you around.
Mr. Jarvis, would you...<eos> I learned that one from my brother.<eos> Mr. Jarvis!<eos> Good morning, you two.<eos> Did he catch you with his patented tortoise of fury?
We have credible information implicating members of the Arena Club in a conspiracy that involves numerous murders and experimental work in a highly dangerous substance.<eos> There is no legitimate reason to prevent the SSR enforcing the law, even on those who believe they are above it.<eos> How are you enjoying your vacation, Agent Carter?<eos> Vigorously.<eos> Jack Thompson thinks very highly of you.
I'm going to get you the physician.<eos> Oh. First...<eos> Now doctor.<eos> Yes, she is awake and talking and beautiful and everything.<eos> Yes, yes, I will keep you updated.
Seven million euros worth of cocaine pour out this bag?<eos> How didn't you notice it getting lighter? !<eos> How didn't you notice it coming off the back of my bike? !<eos> 'Cause that wasn't my fuckin' job!<eos> - I gave it to you to look after!
Jay... And Derick.<eos> That's all I know... no last names.<eos> Thank you for trusting me.<eos> May I borrow your menu, please?<eos> And would you mind inviting your friend who followed you here to join us, Ms. Wyatt?
It's called a conversation breaker, Agent Deakins.<eos> I hear it happens quite a bit in the real world.<eos> Guess I wouldn't know.<eos> Well, this is fun.<eos> Lowry called you last night.
Everything's okay.<eos> But for how long?<eos> Mom, I really, really miss you.<eos> Also, I have a field trip form that needs to be signed for school.<eos> I think if I mail it to you at the prison it's still easier than getting it from Dad.
It's a shame to go inside.<eos> Okay, let's move in the body now.<eos> Marge, I got great news.<eos> We hired the one good lawyer in town.<eos> Yes, Mrs. Simpson, I got you off on a technicality.
He is quite possibly mentally ill and dangerous.<eos> The time for you to take care of him was before this.<eos> Do you know that it could be seen as negligent that you never took your son to a doctor even though he clearly has issues?<eos> Can I please see him?<eos> If and when we need you, we'll contact you.
The one time you ran into her in the village?<eos> I didn't meet her in the village.<eos> I'm Emma's mother.<eos> You're Emma's mother?<eos> She wrote me from here once and told me how much she admired you.
You used to take care of your appearance, but you've lost interest in that, so you avoid mirrors.<eos> Sunlight bothers you, so you avoid that too, about which you're guilty because you think it's unhealthy and even immoral not to like the sun.<eos> You're not a woman of convention or you wouldn't be here, but you like to pretend you are so people don't notice you.<eos> But you sometimes like that as well, and can dress to draw the eye.<eos> But then you think the men who look at you are fools, or worse, to be taken in by such an obvious outward show.
- No, thanks.<eos> No. There's been a few developments we'd like to ask you about.<eos> Now, you said Jamie hadn't been in touch recently.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Only, according to this... he called you six times in two days.
Well, if it wasn't him, Doris must've gone to Francis himself.<eos> She saw an opening and...<eos> Ma'am, there's been a change of plans.<eos> Uh, hold on. What change of plans?<eos> We're taking you back to the White House.
Redirect, Your Honor?<eos> Ms. Kinney, I understand that you attended a service at Ms. Wesley's church a short while ago.<eos> Is that correct?<eos> Yes, that's correct. It was an event honoring several students who attend that church for their community service.<eos> Mm-hmm. And who was it that invited you to that service?
So, what did you mean when you said that you had talks about faith outside of school?<eos> My brother died in an accident 6 months ago.<eos> Ms. Wesley noticed that I wasn't doing so well, so she asked me if everything was all right after class. Mm-hmm.<eos> I told her I was fine, but I went and found her later on at the coffee shop.<eos> And did Ms. Wesley refer you to any kind of psychological counseling?
So, I'm just finding my feet again.<eos> You understand?<eos> I do.<eos> I want you to know...<eos> When I saw you at the lecture, I thought of her.
Vanessa, hold on.<eos> Why do you think he was talking about the Banning Clinic?<eos> The white room with no day or night can only be one place.<eos> The cell I was kept in.<eos> According to the records, Dr. Banning attempted to treat you with hydrotherapy and psychotropic drugs.
Easy, Raymond, you're gonna spook her.<eos> I think it's important to know who's funding your research, don't you think?<eos> For instance...<eos> Project Svarog.<eos> Sorry, is this man bothering you?
Carmen, do you have any idea why Tim might have wanted to kill Caleb Pursey?<eos> He must have owed him money.<eos> How do you know?<eos> Someone... pushed this under the door, two days ago.<eos> Someone's been watching you.
What you're asking is against all journalistic practice. Ah!<eos> Come on, Kelly! It's no bloody Watergate!<eos> I've read your copy before. It's peppered with inaccuracy and prejudice.<eos> I don't need to listen to this.<eos> That's why they chose you to break the story.
Kelly Harrington was only too happy to oblige.<eos> After all, it's what you want your readers to think about our African immigrants.<eos> Who do you know at City Hall?<eos> What?<eos> Someone at City Hall rang you with the story, yes?
--Am I allowed to say "special"?<eos> No, she's not special.<eos> Well, she is to me.<eos> -Mmm. -But not euphemistically.<eos> She's a fan and whenever she sees you, she freaks out.
I just do.<eos> That's ridiculous!<eos> You just do!<eos> I know you.<eos> And from what you say, I've known you a long time.
"Be true."<eos> Be true.<eos> You will come out of it.<eos> When you're at the heart of your trauma, when you've found what you're here for.<eos> I'm not leaving you for anything in this world.
She's got beautiful lips, my wife.<eos> Her name's Marjorie.<eos> I would leave this place, but I need the work.<eos> Jobs are scarce and... I've to feed the family, you understand.<eos> And I wouldn't leave you in any case.
"I never can get back by day, nor can remember plain and clear,<eos> the curious music that I hear."<eos> I've got to go, before the day fellows get here.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> One day soon, no one will touch you when you don't want to be touched.
I'll sing as he cuts me open.<eos> Listen to me!<eos> They'll start by cutting your hair off and shaving your head.<eos> Then they'll sedate you.<eos> Then they'll strap you to a table.
But what if he's not?<eos> Would you want him to pretend?<eos> No.<eos> Then don't ask it of me.<eos> Let me help you.
Because I realized I was wrong.<eos> One person does live there, where it's cold and lonely all the time.<eos> So I, uh, tendered my resignation.<eos> I'll stay on long enough to see you tomorrow.<eos> The last person you see before the surgery will be someone who loves you.
I could look pre-Ottoman, search for earlier accounts.<eos> I don't wish to find him in history.<eos> I wish to find him now, in London.<eos> If that is the case, then I would advise caution.<eos> Which would shock you if you knew me better.
All right.<eos> I can't promise anything, but I'll look into it.<eos> But in the interim you must protect yourself.<eos> He is a predator and his power comes in isolating his prey.<eos> You must surround yourself with people, with those who care for you, those who would defend you.
All the Night Creatures coming out to play.<eos> - Where is she?<eos> - She is with him.<eos> She is home. Oh!<eos> Your hands give you away, almost, Doctor.
I am lost.<eos> No, no.<eos> God doesn't give up that easily.<eos> I'm past penance, so what do you suggest?<eos> I think... ..that you should love yourself, as much as He loves you.
I don't understand.<eos> No-one's ever believed in me like this, Vivian.<eos> I don't know how to thank you.<eos> You're not that innocent.<eos> Darling, the camera loves you.
What I can tell you is that this job, this place, is more important to me than you realize. Hmm.<eos> Whenever I'm confused or overwhelmed, I come in your office and you somehow sense it.<eos> It's like your superpower.<eos> I know I'm not going to be your assistant for the rest of my life, but I do know whatever I do next will be easier because of everything you taught me.<eos> The truth is, I need you now more than I ever have.
I don't even know him.<eos> I haven't seen him since he was a baby, since his father whisked him across the country.<eos> - I told you...<eos> - You told me that losing Adam was the biggest regret of your life.<eos> Ms. Grant, I've known you for a while now, and I don't think you were ever going to send that letter.
- I'm not a traitor.<eos> - Mrs. Wery claims otherwise.<eos> - It's impossible.<eos> - We'll have to see.<eos> - Did they treat you well?
- Put the glass down!<eos> - What's wrong?<eos> Something's wrong with the wine.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Miss Li, did we offend you somehow?
We just cried and screamed and we didn't hurt him because we were afraid to get him upset.<eos> God, that's victim shit. Jesus!<eos> We should fight him.<eos> We should drop a crazy-ass bomb on him.<eos> I saw him carry one of you and lay you on the bed like you weighed nothing.
Two days ago, you brokered a transplant at Maahir Care, two corneas and a kidney.<eos> Where did the organs come from?<eos> Where?<eos> From no one, a Dalit.<eos> Well, that man is the one who is making a fool of you.
Ah... yes, well, well done, well done, everyone.<eos> Perhaps I'd better... - HE SIGHS - ..rest.<eos> - Don't worry, Aunt Mary, er... just a moment...<eos> Ah hello, hello.<eos> Sorry, er, don't know how that happened, but, er... now I've got you here, I wonder if you could help me.
Why rush something into an oversaturated market?<eos> After a while, people feel cheated if the product doesn't match the hype.<eos> But with this, I can promise you that we're...<eos> I'm sorry, Ms. Goodwin.<eos> If I could just interrupt you, we are receiving unconfirmed reports from several Internet news sources, and since we have you here, sources are saying that you've been diagnosed and treated for anaplastic myeloma, an aggressive form of blood cancer,
This morning the young girl identified you... ..as the woman who tortured and murdered her mother.<eos> Do you think I care?<eos> Where is Pietr now?<eos> Tell her that her life may depend on how she answers the next question.<eos> Where is the man who would visit you and tell you which farms to attack?
General, a word.<eos> We're approximately two hours out--<eos> - Abort the mission.<eos> - Mr. President?<eos> - I'm ordering you to abort.
Security cameras.<eos> A locked passage gate.<eos> A swing-set.<eos> Well let's go around the front, see if anyone's in.<eos> Sorry to disturb you.
You gonna shoot me, too?<eos> Oh, and deprive myself the pleasure of kicking your ass?<eos> Ha ha. Is that a threat?<eos> Are you physically threatening me?<eos> I am ordering you to leave this hospital and offering to physically assist you if necessary.
- Four...<eos> - Gender?<eos> - Girl.<eos> - Well... Looks like you've got an answer for everything.<eos> So I'll just leave you to your shopping. Oh!
Can I get off with whatever this is?<eos> It usually takes six months to a year to develop sensation again.<eos> Look, I just want to know if I can go back to being a guy.<eos> Medically, other than the breast implants, it's too soon to even consider another procedure.<eos> I'd be irresponsible in advising you otherwise, and no reputable physician will operate on you again without at least six months of intensive therapy.
Go home, Mrs Cratchit.<eos> You're letting me go?<eos> I don't understand...<eos> A man will hang for the murder of Jacob Marley and having looked into his eyes today and seen the evil that dwells there I am at peace with that.<eos> Though I know I would never have peace again were I to send you to stand beside him at the gallows.
Would you pick up a person who was drunk and emotionally assaultive?<eos> Do it every day.<eos> But I guess, yes, if the person was a friend.<eos> Good answer.<eos> Your mother raised you well.
I just want to biopsy it and we can take it from there.<eos> Take what from where?<eos> Early detection would have prevented this.<eos> We really encourage regular self-exams. Yeah, I know.<eos> Oh, they're waiting for you in the Roosevelt Room, ma'am.
It's restricted.<eos> Uh, we're looking for a couple young kids.<eos> They'd have been heading for the research labs.<eos> Can we just take a quick look?<eos> I can't let you in there.
You're welcome, by the way.<eos> For the piece.<eos> Oh, you think I'm looking for validation?<eos> I'm just doing my job.<eos> You know, I asked Public Health PR for a one-on-one with you and they said no.
Say hi for me.<eos> Alison says hi.<eos> Tell her, "Hi, Al."<eos> Your mom wanted me to tell you to come join us in the kitchen.<eos> She's gonna make dumplings while I quiz you with flashcards.
Here's your speech.<eos> Remember... shake, commendation, shake again.<eos> Late last night, I asked for and received the resignation of NSA director Lieutenant General Diane Peters.<eos> I'm so sorry, Diane, but you should know that Pope and Associates is here to help you transition to the public sector or private life if you prefer.<eos> That's not exactly why I hired you.
Great. And now they are discussing how casually you are dressed.<eos> They say you look like a prisoner or a pirate.<eos> An exercise book.<eos> Why did Menopause not warn us that the Chinese were going to out gift us like that?<eos> Our intel suggested they hated you.
Look at you.<eos> I think you're from Kansas.<eos> - I can see it...<eos> - I am.<eos> I voted for you twice.
We left.<eos> We don't work for the construction company anymore.<eos> I thought I should come here and talk to you.<eos> All right, go ahead.<eos> I wanted to tell you... I really admire you, I think you're a very decent and beautiful woman.
- No, just wait a minute.<eos> - Would you like to tell me.<eos> - You only need to know one thing.<eos> Would you like to tell me what is the meaning of this? You know why?<eos> Because I'm a well-mannered person, but if I wasn't, I'd kick you out right now.
Which means I need to go, too.<eos> Another instance of gun violence.<eos> That's front page.<eos> Miss Whelan.<eos> I'll have an aide escort you out.
I would kind of like to take care of it on my own.<eos> I think we all would.<eos> I want to give this back to you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> If someone is threatening you, I can help.
I'm gonna do everything I can to...<eos> Sir?<eos> Sir?<eos> The president hung up on me.<eos> I'm sure he doesn't blame you.
Day-after-day pain.<eos> Puts you to bed and sits there waitin' for you when you wake up.<eos> Like a big screw stuck itself in your chest.<eos> That's what it was like for me, anyway.<eos> But someday... and if I said exactly when, I'd be a liar... but... someday the light of the Lord will reach you.
I'm sorry.<eos> You sure he's worth it?<eos> I really wish he weren't.<eos> Slow down.<eos> This ol' boy knows what's good for him, he'll wait for you.
I've seen navvies fight a hundred times.<eos> Never seen a navvy shake hands before a fight.<eos> Whoever he is, he's a gentleman.<eos> I thought you were leaving tonight.<eos> I thought I'd never see you again.
- What is that?<eos> - It's your Thanksgiving meal.<eos> Why are there two place settings?<eos> You know Charlie's not coming, right?<eos> I do. That was just for in case you wanted someone to sit with you.
I did what you asked me to do.<eos> I shot you several times.<eos> - So did I.<eos> - Oh, I must be bulletproof!<eos> Every time we killed you back there, time reset the day.
For panic attacks?<eos> No, for stress.<eos> It... it's no big deal.<eos> Totally good otherwise.<eos> There's a patient for you in bed 2, and a Paul Weatherly is calling for you again.
Cheers.<eos> You didn't tell me this was his gaffe.<eos> Does it really matter?<eos> Obviously.<eos> I almost didn't recognise you without your axe to grind.
Never mind.<eos> It's not important.<eos> Is there anything you need to tell me?<eos> No.<eos> Here, let me walk you out.
It was an honour to have treated... such a great person.<eos> (I should be the one to thank you.)<eos> (I have prepared a small gift.)<eos> It's not just any business card.<eos> This card will save you in about any situation... anywhere there are Arabs.
The only thing we know for sure is that she was allowed to leave the house sometimes.<eos> That's how the imposter was able to gain access to her.<eos> HOLMES: You can imagine she's been through quite an ordeal, but she remembers you and Richard, and she's been asking for you.<eos> So as soon as he's recanted his confession, he'll be brought here.<eos> Would you like me to take you to see her?
Oh, I'm so glad I came.<eos> My husband's gonna think he's having an affair.<eos> And I might have one myself.<eos> Ms. Calvert?<eos> Dr. Forbes will see you now.
I cannot live like this any longer.<eos> You would be quite separate at Buckingham House.<eos> Yes.<eos> Don't take less than five shillings.<eos> Have I ever let you down before, Mrs Jenkins?
They expect me to fail.<eos> They don't believe me capable of being Queen.<eos> I think they're mistaken, Ma'am.<eos> And anyone who dares comment on your stature should be sent straight to the Tower.<eos> I've only known you a short while, Ma'am, but I'm confident that you will bring great credit to the monarchy.
You cannot lecture me any more, Sir John.<eos> I will not listen to you.<eos> And if my mother only knew what you were like, she would not listen to you either.<eos> Ma'am, the Duchess was hoping for a word.<eos> Mama sent you?
Drake who?<eos> Holloway.<eos> Uh, I don't know who that is.<eos> - Oh. - But sometimes I think Vic had a whole secret life.<eos> Well, uh, the reason Drake suggested coming to see you is I'm a reporter.
- Yeah, it's kind of hard to prove a negative.<eos> But it's all right.<eos> I think Agent Knox is dead wrong about you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I think St. Patrick used you, just like he did before.
It has everything to do with love.<eos> We are as strong as they are... hell, stronger...<eos> Till we fall in love and lose focus.<eos> Then we fuck shit up, and they know it.<eos> When St. Patrick looked at you, he didn't see a future judge, future Attorney General.
I'm sorry.<eos> Marina brought us chocolates from Paris.<eos> That's very kind.<eos> My son doesn't have your good manners.<eos> He invites you over and takes off like a teenager.
I would like to see my wife... my son.<eos> Good evening, Mr. President.<eos> Commander Green.<eos> The President would like to keep these briefings to senior advisors for the time being.<eos> We'll summon you if we need you.
- It really isn't quite how it seems.<eos> - So how is it?<eos> I knew Tosh had requested the divorce papers.<eos> He showed them to me.<eos> He accused you of having an affair.
All his stuff's here, so just feel free to...<eos> Erm, do you know the code to the safe?<eos> 4-1-3-2.<eos> Oh, er, Mrs Walker, erm, just wanted to check.<eos> You sure it was Tosh who phoned you last night?
When the audience is there-- the critics-- it feels like a cage to me.<eos> Well, let's get out of the cage.<eos> Let's do something about this--<eos> Alessandra.<eos> Hey, hey, is this guy bothering you?
We still have a lot of things to discover.<eos> Who's that guy?<eos> He's the head of a very awful claque.<eos> They want money, or they'll boo you during the performance.<eos> If they boo you during the performance, I'll go down in the audience and I'll kick him in the balls, you know, and I'll make him a castrati.
I'm thinking Brandon saw someone in a green car following you and Captain Grant.<eos> That's news to me.<eos> Well... I'm just trying to understand your relationship with Captain Grant.<eos> We were friends.<eos> And he was picking you up at the station three times a week?
She wants it all.<eos> All this five million dollars?<eos> She wants it all.<eos> You mess with Jimmy Chung, you die.<eos> I'm not messing with you.
Well, assuming the efficacy is what you say it is, let's do this again in six months. Good?<eos> - Quite good.<eos> - It's a plan.<eos> So can I have the keys so I can get the hell out of here?<eos> My colleague will have to drive you out the gate.
- As he did with me.<eos> - No.<eos> No.<eos> He writes to me, but all he really wants is Arnold.<eos> Miss Peggy, he loves you.
Akira, none of this happened.<eos> It's just your delusion.<eos> Why will the police try to kill you, Akira?<eos> I mean... there's no reason.<eos> The inspector whom you assaulted, took you to the psychiatrist.
- Copulating with them.<eos> He'll make a compelling case study for the new book.<eos> What?<eos> Too bad you're wearing that.<eos> I'd take you to the party, but it's black tie.
He used to brag a lot.<eos> Okay, I'm not bragging.<eos> I love this stuff.<eos> I know how to sell this stuff.<eos> I have a big presentation I'd like to show you upstairs, so if you will?
Now, you've never seen<eos> Reggie Clifton before?<eos> No, sir.<eos> Like I said, not until he grabbed me on the running trail.<eos> But you say he was following you in a van?
- Beatrice?<eos> - Mary Thorne!<eos> Oh, good afternoon, Lady Arabella.<eos> - Is Dr Thorne at home? - Yes, he is.<eos> I'll show you through.
I'll show you through.<eos> My Lady Arabella Gresham.<eos> This is an honour, Lady Arabella.<eos> You're aware that Mary was this afternoon having tea with Beatrice and Miss Oriel?<eos> I do not believe I've congratulated you on Beatrice's engagement.
Janet, where is my uncle?<eos> Please, let's say no more.<eos> Dear Lady Scatcherd, I'm so happy to see you here.<eos> Everything's ready if you'd like to go upstairs.<eos> Janet will take you, and I'll be in to say good night.
oh, so sorry.<eos> Mrs. Melman almost done.<eos> Please, for you to wait outside.<eos> That's not gonna happen, yu.<eos> Step back. Ma'am, we're calling paramedics to take you to a hospital.
Now, as your husband, he must have known where you got your drugs.<eos> Watch it.<eos> I recurred as a deputy D.A. for two seasons on "Legal L.A."<eos> You keep talking like this, and I will ask for a lawyer.<eos> Well, you'll probably need one when we arrest you for murder.
His mother was dead, so I made sure To make good friends with my husband's accountant.<eos> "Oh, Bobby," I'd say, "you work so much harder than I do.<eos> Let me handle the bills."<eos> I don't think he understood that I was seeing checks go out, to cover these giant personal expenses On his Corporate credit card.<eos> So, you knew that Mr. Cushing was cheating on you.
Sorry to upset you, and I...<eos> I didn't pick you specifically. I looked for every Jennifer, Jen, Jenny Edwards or Edwards as a maiden name on Linkedin, Twitter, Facebook.<eos> Well, I'm the lucky winner, then.<eos> What did Gene say to you about me?<eos> Gene is using you as an alibi.
I'm looking for Chad. Is he around?<eos> Chad!<eos> Okay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Actually, uh, sorry to bother you.
A quick hug?<eos> Am I, am I really in danger?<eos> We don't think Kang is who he says he is.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> We think he may be using you to pass along information to a foreign agency.
How'd you find that out?<eos> Jackpot.<eos> Hot pies!<eos> Come and get your hot, delicious pies! Ooh!<eos> Ma'am, can I tempt you with a free, delicious hot pie?
I didn't do my homework before, but you have quite a history of sloppy mistakes costing Peter Florrick convictions.<eos> And you didn't tell me that you walked through the blood at the Richard Locke crime scene.<eos> There were at least a dozen cops in that apartment.<eos> There was no room to maneuver, but I didn't lose those bullets.<eos> Did the AUSA interview you?
Excuse me.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Are you Kate Pierson from the B‚Äê52s?<eos> ‚Äê Yeah.<eos> ‚Äê Oh, my God, Kate Pierson, I can't believe I'm meeting you on my birthday.
- But you told them...<eos> - They believed Jessica.<eos> Everybody always believed Jessica.<eos> She was the warm one.<eos> And that was why your parents put you in Radley.
I understand.<eos> He put you through hell.<eos> And I'm sure the news at the bank today was a little overwhelming.<eos> But it did help us work up a theory.<eos> And we think that your husband targeted you for your money.
I'm fine.<eos> Yeah, I'm doing great.<eos> Thanks. I'm glad to be back.<eos> I heard about the shenanigans in your class yesterday.<eos> I'm so sorry that the students put you through that.
We have queries, and thou shall answer, or we shall force perforce be moved to make a star chamber...<eos> Stop.<eos> We are so not doing this.<eos> Look, Naomi, we know that you were having a show-mance with Zane.<eos> He dumped you, and then you busted up his car.
We are so not doing this.<eos> Look, Naomi, we know that you were having a show-mance with Zane.<eos> He dumped you, and then you busted up his car.<eos> My lord, he speaks with a curious tongue. Car?<eos> It's what he's gonna put you in the back of when he arrests you for murder.
The Abuddinian Women's Forum has been a constructive voice on women's issues for a quarter century.<eos> In order to be your next president and put women's issues on the agenda in this country, I'm going to need your support.<eos> In 20 years in the palace, and two years as first lady, you never showed up here once.<eos> - That's true.<eos> - Now you want us to support you for president just because you're a woman?
Can you tell us where you were before?<eos> Ms. Keating.<eos> The clinic.<eos> I had to pick up some work.<eos> Did anyone else see you there?
- Nothing?<eos> - Not a lick.<eos> I think you're lying.<eos> I think you do remember.<eos> I... I don't blame you for not wanting to talk about it.
Ms. Keating.<eos> This is her time.<eos> Don't speak for her.<eos> My apologies.<eos> I've read all your files, Ms. Crowley, and the problem I'm having is during your trial, you never officially stated that your husband abused you.
You're gonna believe whatever you want no matter what I say.<eos> If you look in file C-11, there are photos taken after one of Mr. Crowley's attacks that are evidence of the abuse.<eos> Fine.<eos> Let's say you were indeed abused.<eos> The police report states that there was no imminent threat at the time of the murder, so my question is, if your husband was abusing you so badly, why did you kill him instead of just leaving him?
Okay.<eos> Did I... did I ever tell you about the time my mom caught me wearing her lingerie?<eos> Irene stays in jail if you say what I think you're gonna say in there.<eos> Shouldn't she?<eos> Rodney raised you, right?
Well, here it is.<eos> Immunity.<eos> - The evidence?<eos> - Anonymous source.<eos> Provided information that ties you to the charges.
We were attracted to each other.<eos> So there's no question of him paying for it.<eos> So he didn't pay you?<eos> He did not pay you!<eos> Did he force you?
It's not possible<eos> - Objection, your honor.<eos> Mr. Deepak, please keep the dignity of the court.<eos> My friends help me out too.<eos> Your friends help you out.
We don't mean any harm.<eos> We're here to protect you. That's why we've been sent here.<eos> Now, the fact that you ran from us must mean you've got something to hide.<eos> Are you hiding something?<eos> Maybe we need to search you.
Kaylee.<eos> I'm Ian. Where's the demon now?<eos> He's coming!<eos> Please!<eos> Then we better keep you safe.
He's just a kid.<eos> How's it going?<eos> Still standing.<eos> - You?<eos> - Same. Looking better than the last time I saw you.
Keep her safe, get her out of Insomnia.<eos> Oh, I almost forgot.<eos> You'll need this.<eos> Give Prince Noctis my regards.<eos> Libertus will take care of you from here.
Getting old is tough.<eos> - What do you make of the mayor's stance?<eos> - Can we have a statement?<eos> - Are you prepared for an inquiry?<eos> - Does City Hall support you?
- Table manners and etiquette?<eos> I think you could do with a lesson in manners, sonny.<eos> Hey!<eos> Where'd you come from?<eos> I didn't hear you...
And you are not ready, Strokedeath.<eos> It's Deathstroke and I'm ready for anything.<eos> I am Slade Wilson.<eos> I am the best at everything I do, and you waste your senile talents on this fool?<eos> I don't need you or your stupid forbidden move.
Patients come to me, and I assess them, then I refer them forward to the appropriate next step... Treatment plans, specialists.<eos> Does that clear things up a little?<eos> Yes.<eos> Okay, well, there are a couple of things I'd like to know more about.<eos> It says here that you separated from your husband after he struck you in the face with a jack handle.
He'll kill me.<eos> He said he would, and I believe him.<eos> This is your husband.<eos> It's not some intruder.<eos> This is your husband who beat you.
The disease was discovered in Germany by a Japanese doctor. But no cure has been found yet.<eos> The doctor was explaining to me... but I couldn't understand anything. Except for the fact... that medical science had not found a cure for his disease.<eos> My only solace was... that he would fall asleep for a while after the injection. And get some rest too.<eos> Excuse me, ma'am.<eos> There's a call for you from your residence.
No, sir.<eos> For a woman your age seeking asylum, the ability to bear children is a factor.<eos> You're wrong, Miss Crain.<eos> We do owe you.<eos> We're not going to send you back to face the Kempeitai or the Resistance.
Selina?<eos> What do you want?<eos> I'm looking for someone.<eos> I think you may have seen her.<eos> And if I have, why would I tell you?
I will write to him.<eos> I will make him understand he has nothing to fear.<eos> I'm not gonna let him go.<eos> Very well.<eos> Don't say I didn't warn you.
He loves me and I love him.<eos> I am telling you one last time, let Ed go.<eos> - No.<eos> - Very well.<eos> Don't say I didn't warn you.
Well, she's hardly what you call a girl, - is she?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Well, thanks for the crustless egg thing, but I got errands to run.<eos> Uh no, sorry, miss.<eos> No one is to leave the house, until we find exactly who is following you.
Old money means Scandinavian help.<eos> Well, at least it did back in the 1950s.<eos> And, uh, if you had balked at Swedish, I would have done some sort of double-talk and backtracked around, uh, Chinese.<eos> -Wonderful.<eos> - Well, it is until they get you to the ATM to take the curse off your money.
You weren't there.<eos> You never are.<eos> Let's get this clear.<eos> On 9 October, No√©mie Vanassche disappears.<eos> You find clues that lead you to...
"The Silo?"<eos> Was that not worth a moment of his pain?<eos> This is a bit absurd, isn't it?<eos> Well...<eos> You know, I'm struggling to see why I don't recommend to the Met that they charge you with wasting their time with this stunt.
And the most beautiful.<eos> And later, when she just left you?<eos> It felt... like a stone in my stomach.<eos> It still does.<eos> And then, when we found you and told you she was in trouble...?
She was 18.<eos> It's normal at that age<eos> - to meet a boy and... - It's normal to meet a boy and drown?<eos> Maybe I should have said no.<eos> And the next time Alyssa called you, what did she say?
Which I did.<eos> Did you hear back from Mr. Peters?<eos> Not till two days later.<eos> I got a call from his assistant to tell me that there had been an accident.<eos> His assistant called you, not Mr. Peters?
His assistant called you, not Mr. Peters?<eos> They did a headcount.<eos> They thought she might have fallen off the boat.<eos> Somebody needs to stick it to this prick.<eos> He had his assistant call you to tell you your daughter was dead.
Wasn't her intention, but it wasn't a total accident.<eos> She didn't actually think she'd die.<eos> She just... found out that her boyfriend fucked someone else and wanted to punish him by ending up in hospital, not letting him visit her for a bit.<eos> She decided to walk into a busy cycle lane, wanting to get tangled in a bike - break a finger, maybe.<eos> As it turns out, bikes go fast and flip you into the road.
- Five minutes, maybe.<eos> Go out the back.<eos> In the garage is Donny's motorcycle and his field box.<eos> I'll keep them away as long as I can.<eos> All right, tell them I forced you.
Shit.<eos> I mean, hands up, I made a mistake, but the way people enjoyed kicking me, that's what got to me.<eos> The casual fun they had and, um...<eos> I just felt I couldn't go on.<eos> Who found you?
Well, let's do the interview already.<eos> You know what?<eos> Another time.<eos> When all of this is over.<eos> I'm supposed to be interviewing you. I can't leave so quickly.
You may not hear from me for a while.<eos> What's happening, Pablo?<eos> What are you going to do?<eos> Something I have to do.<eos> But you know that I will never, never leave you, right?
Tell me your arm went through the window<eos> - in a car crash a couple years ago!<eos> - Okay. Okay.<eos> I don't know your mother, okay?<eos> I've never been to Queens and I don't know you.
-Nothing.<eos> -Out with it. -No... You always do that...<eos> What?<eos> This, actually.<eos> You pretend nothing affects you but actually... deep down, you're fragile.
You know Leo Elster?<eos> I know a lot more than that.<eos> I know Qualia are collecting synths that have become spontaneously sentient.<eos> I also know they're building illegal synth prototypes that are styled as children.<eos> My guess is Milo Khoury hired you to learn from the former and apply it to the latter.
- This was the only way I could be sure.<eos> - Sure of what? What are you gonna do to me?<eos> In the historical record, Grace Day dies at 11:27 a.m. on the corner of Westlake and Harmon Avenue.<eos> That's by my dentist. How... how would...<eos> It was impossible to determine what would kill you, and if I had intervened...
Thirty seconds.<eos> Spew it out.<eos> Snapper Carr, he's refusing to acknowledge my hiring.<eos> Oh, I see. And what would you like me to do about it?<eos> Tell him to listen to you.
Okay.<eos> I can make it.<eos> Patience is a virtue.<eos> That's from Psychomachia, fifth century.<eos> The doctor will see you now.
Suit yourself.<eos> Dora, Dora, you know I adore ya.<eos> - And you, as well, sweetheart.<eos> - Not too tight... careful.<eos> - They're ready for you now, Miss Moffat.
Do you remember that furniture we looked at?<eos> I do.<eos> You decide you want to make it right?<eos> Jaclyn Blackstone is a 39-year-old ambidextrous woman living in Berkeley. with complaints of intermittent memory loss, poor concentration, loss of time.<eos> It says here that you separated from your husband It says here that you separated from your husband after he struck you in the face.
Call me back.<eos> - Yes?<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> - I'm here about your east wall. - What?<eos> The building manager notified you, yes?
You know, where I work now.<eos> Maybe next time.<eos> Julia, Jake is playing you.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> He's playing you.
Previously on "Chance"...<eos> Mrs. Blackstone.<eos> I'm Eldon Chance.<eos> It says here that you separated from your husband after he struck you in the face.
- Look at me.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Rice pudding is a stretch right now.<eos> Right.<eos> Okay, I have to go chase down this car, but I-I promise to keep you in the loop.
Ma'am, we heard reports of a lynch mob.<eos> Something they saw on the Internet.<eos> Who did this to you?<eos> They killed two kids.<eos> Okay, we're gonna get you to the hospital.
Okay.<eos> Jesus, there's another one.<eos> - Are you real?<eos> - Yes, ma'am, flesh and blood.<eos> I got you now.
Come on, let's go say hi to everybody.<eos> Hey!<eos> - Morning, Ms. Goodwin.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> What brings you in on a Saturday?
Japan is farther away than I thought.<eos> Here we are.<eos> Your Majesty.<eos> I'm going back to Korea.<eos> But the people need you in Shanghai.
- What's his name?<eos> How old is he? - Danny Fayad, ma'am.<eos> We have a couple A.G. candidates who could be helpful.<eos> Bring them in. Sorry to bother you, ma'am.<eos> - Your daughter needs you upstairs.
- Coming, sir.<eos> I got an idea.<eos> Just sit tight.<eos> I'll get back to you.<eos> Now, I'm sending you with a full detail.
Just sit tight.<eos> I'll get back to you.<eos> Now, I'm sending you with a full detail.<eos> Keep this with you at all times.<eos> You press it, and six agents will be surrounding you in seconds.
Mrs. Kirkman, it's my job to worry.<eos> You're too good.<eos> Hold on, ma'am.<eos> Copy that.<eos> Ma'am, the president needs you.
I'm sorry about that scene with Bernadette.<eos> Did it drive you away?<eos> It just reminded me why I'm leaving.<eos> Giving in my notice today.<eos> Miss Moore, I don't know you very well, and I have no right to ask this, but it'd mean a lot to me if you just hold off for a moment before you do that.
- Who are you?<eos> - Cole Stockwell.<eos> Sorry, I don't shake hands; it's not personal.<eos> And why are you here?<eos> The senator told me to help you.
Hi, Paul.<eos> He's with me.<eos> My usual driver is sick today.<eos> Oh. Hello, Ms. Campbell.<eos> The general's expecting you.
Oh, you got to be kidding me.<eos> Pull up over here.<eos> Damn, damn, damn.<eos> Look at the bright side, you're gonna crush the breathalyzer.<eos> Do you know why I pulled you over?
She admits she is keeping a sinful secret.<eos> She admits she is guilty of allowing an innocent man to be painted a thief.<eos> She is horrified by and yet obsessed with every detail of Mr Luker's abduction.<eos> Could this be because HER secret is threatened with discovery?<eos> When first you arrived, Miss Clack, I thought your need for money drove you and then perhaps your admiration for Godfrey led you to imagine yourself closer to him by means of being his defence.
When first you arrived, Miss Clack, I thought your need for money drove you and then perhaps your admiration for Godfrey led you to imagine yourself closer to him by means of being his defence.<eos> I do not understand.<eos> But now... ..I see that it is hatred of Rachel that makes you seek to bring her down.<eos> Why do you hate her so?<eos> Is it jealousy that eats at you?
You are still prepared to give me away, are you not?<eos> As a friend and a loyal servant of your family, Miss Rachel, may I venture to ask, is your heart truly set on this marriage?<eos> I am marrying in despair, Mr Bruff.<eos> On the chance of dropping into some sort of stagnant happiness which may reconcile me to my life.<eos> Well, I cannot believe that Godfrey Ablewhite would follow you in this.
I might have gotten turned around.<eos> Oh, wait.<eos> There you are.<eos> Why are you in the alley?<eos> It took a while, but I found you.
Don't move.<eos> Sam.<eos> Take a look at this.<eos> Clearly, we are working for the wrong government agency.<eos> A volunteer will bring you back up.
And at first, you know, I didn't want to wear it, I wouldn't wear it, I wouldn't even look at it, but now it's... It's all I have and I-I can't take it off now, so...<eos> It's okay.<eos> My God, this is so dumb.<eos> What am I doing?<eos> I'm... supposed to be comforting you, not snotting all over you.
What?<eos> I can't be interested in my daughter's life?<eos> Since when?<eos> And I knew that Scorpion was the type of business that could help me.<eos> How do we help you exactly?
Quinn-<eos> - I knew an agent afloat by that name, long time ago.<eos> Uh-oh. Did I arrest you?<eos> No.<eos> What was it the boys used to call you?
Lieutenant Vivian Mills, navigator.<eos> She have family on board?<eos> Lieutenant Mills, please report to the wardroom.<eos> Lieutenant Mills to the wardroom.<eos> Your Tiger is looking for you.
You're not supposed to have guns in school.<eos> Santa Muerte?<eos> I hear the Mexican cartels pray to her for protection.<eos> Can I have my shirt back now?<eos> Your DNA is going to come back IDing you as Giza Barerra.
Well, I bet you know who Alejandro Medina is.<eos> See, we know that you killed his father when you took over his cartel.<eos> I wonder what kind of a tattoo he's gonna give you when he finds out that you're alive.<eos> I don't know who that is.<eos> You were 14 years old when your father married you to a man 40 years older than you.
Certainly none that affect your happiness, which is all I care about.<eos> Ms. Keen, I need you to come with me, please.<eos> Do you have the lab results?<eos> Dr. Wright told me she should have them in a few minutes.<eos> I've been instructed to prep you for surgery in anticipation of a positive result.
He deserved it.<eos> Go to where the husband works.<eos> See what they know.<eos> I know this is difficult, but we have to ask you a few questions.<eos> Is this the man who kidnapped you?
Let's see if we can get him over here now.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - Thank you, Aaron.<eos> Sir.<eos> Congresswoman Hookstraten, last time we spoke, I told you I'd keep you updated on the Capitol bombing.
But I need some information from you-- we're trying to find out where Russell had been staying the last few weeks.<eos> Police checked his car and his credit cards.<eos> They're pretty sure that he didn't drive too far outside the city.<eos> Now, you went all the way to Maui with him.<eos> So I thought maybe he'd taken you to the place where he does his deep dives.
You weren't with friends, you were with Tate.<eos> You were having an affair.<eos> We spoke to Mr. Orvis's housekeeper.<eos> She said last week you two had a fight.<eos> He called you a psycho.
We're gonna take him right up.<eos> We were just in bed one minute.<eos> Then the whole world caved in.<eos> I don't know why I was okay and he was hurt so badly.<eos> Look, I'll update you as soon as we know.
Who has access?<eos> And who knows they're empty?<eos> For starters.<eos> I've been on your side in these situations so many times, it's quite interesting to see it from this perspective.<eos> Niko, if we had any information that could help, I'd tell you.
It was conceived artificially.<eos> -Who is the donor?<eos> -I can't tell you that.<eos> I'm sure you can tell me things... by merely hinting at it... without breaking your oath.<eos> If you don't say anything now I will assume that Elina didn't visit you because she had a venereal disease.
You know what?<eos> No.<eos> But they're for Teacher Appreciation Day.<eos> I got to be honest.<eos> I don't appreciate you.
That's the woman who sued Jack McGill for sexual harassment.<eos> I think we've found a link between her and Damien Novak. Don't you?<eos> So, you're saying that this guy... the one that was sending me all the messages... he's really the one who beat up Jack?<eos> That's exactly what we're saying.<eos> You were being pursued by someone who, up until the moment he contacted you, had only pursued the predators of teenage girls.
I have never struck anyone.<eos> I use only direct measures of force.<eos> We'll see.<eos> You are suspended.<eos> Officers from the Internal Affairs Office will take you to the prosecutor, where you'll be charged with exceeding your powers and failure to fulfill your duties.
And?<eos> Early in his career, Monsieur Louboutin, in a fit of artistic peak, used red nail polish to lacquer the soles of his shoes.<eos> And that's been a trademark of the brand ever since, yeah.<eos> Unfortunately for you, the soles scuff, so I quite literally followed your footprints over to Mr. Pereya's workstation where, judging by the copious scuffage, you've been a very busy bee.<eos> Whoever placed you here, might've had Joaquin Pereya murdered.
Grace happens to live in New York.<eos> Marcus is inviting her to the station as we speak.<eos> So, make yourself an alternate breakfast.<eos> We should have Joaquin Pereya's murder solved by the time you get dressed.<eos> We get that you never expected anyone to connect you to these murders, but... it still would have been a good idea not to keep so much evidence in your apartment.
Sir.. - Sorry.<eos> Sir, I know who was Liak's partner in crime.<eos> Sir.<eos> I know...his partner's name.<eos> Did Liak send you?
~ Exactly.<eos> We haven't found footprints near the body.<eos> How can we be sure anyone else was here?<eos> Apart from George Summersbee, and Bella.<eos> What brought you to the woods?
- I know.<eos> There goes the sun.<eos> Dr Farmer.<eos> Dr Farmer. Dr Farmer.<eos> The president of the AMA has accused you of attention-seeking.
Just Coke, Sprite, something like that.<eos> - Okay, yeah.<eos> Benjamin, you wanted to see me?<eos> Is this where I get whacked?<eos> This is where we all blow you because you were so freaking great.
Like you.<eos> Me?<eos> I am not suffering.<eos> Yes.<eos> Your husband is a long way away, and you fear he no longer loves or desires you.
Honey, I'm about to lose you.<eos> I'm on a plane, and we're taking off.<eos> Where you going? Um... (Line beeps) Okay, the Chateau Marmont?<eos> Alan Thicke's birthday party?<eos> We went back to my place, and I blew you in my hot tub!
Right. Do you not care about how we feel? She needs to be released...<eos> She said Mama Beth came to her in a dream last night.<eos> Madam! Madam, please! Calm down.<eos> Come with me.<eos> So tell me, Zeta, all those years ago, why did Elias fire you without a reference?
And Lucy.<eos> You were already blackmailing your own father, but are you capable of murder?<eos> And Zeta - Elias ended your career as a nanny.<eos> But that was in the past!<eos> Yes, it was, and I'm sure that your gift will already have told you this, but, er... we have eliminated you from our enquiries.
My Lady, you are surrounded by many wonderful things.<eos> The love of your husband - do you not consider it a blessing?<eos> My husband's love has never done me any good.<eos> Never shortened a dreary ball by so much as a minute.<eos> Do you consider your husband's love to have ever saved you from anything?
Not really.<eos> My degree's in cosmetology.<eos> My whole r√©sum√©'s a lie.<eos> But you would be amazed what ladies will reveal while you're bleaching their arm hair.<eos> I don't know you that well.
I'm Jeanne.<eos> - Do we know each other?<eos> - Aren't you Mrs. Remigi?<eos> You must be looking for my sister-in-law.<eos> Sorry, I saw you here and assumed you were her.
Pablo Guerrero.<eos> Mary of the Mountains Enriquez?<eos> You have a very good CV, Mary of the Mountains.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What would you do first in the firm if we hired you?
- Dead?<eos> Me?<eos> - I was concerned.<eos> You were nosy!<eos> I haven't seen you.
This stuff's life or death to 'em.<eos> He'd have had to have gone all the way back to the caravan park, found some chalet he's never clapped eyes on before, get the accelerant.<eos> Too much planning for heat of the moment.<eos> Well, it works if we can prove he's lying about the time.<eos> Ma'am, Marcus wants you at the lab.
Then we reason with him.<eos> I haven't heard from Peter in five days.<eos> Who knows what kind of shit storm we're walking into?<eos> It might be.<eos> Ah, Dr. Jordan. I thought I might find you here.
Let me talk to her.<eos> Alone.<eos> - No. No.<eos> - You're too emotionally invested. You said you wanted to do this together so I'm coming with you.<eos> - Amy will see you now.
- [whispers] Me, too.<eos> Take care.<eos> [softly] And what about you?<eos> Come on.<eos> I'm going to take you with me.
Take care.<eos> [softly] And what about you?<eos> Come on.<eos> I'm going to take you with me.<eos> I'm going to take you with me...
[softly] And what about you?<eos> Come on.<eos> I'm going to take you with me.<eos> I'm going to take you with me...<eos> I'm going to take you with me.
You should have a set of keys to your home.<eos> You'll always be welcome there.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> Never seen you on the train before.
Oh, she's dreadful cold, sir.<eos> Bell, my love.<eos> What were you thinking?<eos> You are a poor husband.<eos> Your husband has bargained you away, madam.
Bell, my love.<eos> What were you thinking?<eos> You are a poor husband.<eos> Your husband has bargained you away, madam.<eos> He has sold you to me in exchange for a piece of wood.
What would you suggest, Stephen?<eos> We should accept our position... .. and be thankful for it.<eos> He has poisoned your mind.<eos> So, gentlemen - what are we to do?<eos> Try and, er... describe... .. what most distresses you, my lady.
Caroline, get Mr. Cassidy for me.<eos> After all, Cassidy, I told you, all that cash...<eos> And there's a sense of movement ahead, movement ahead...<eos> She steals money. Then she decides to drive away. Then she becomes guilty about it.<eos> Gee, I'm sorry, I didn't hear you in all this rain.
I can feel she's not in the house.<eos> Desiste.<eos> I see your rage.<eos> And raise you mine.<eos> You will die, but how much pain you feel is up to you.
Well... OK.<eos> Come here, you little witch.<eos> We found the body of Peter Meijer.<eos> There were photos of you on his phone.<eos> We have an eyewitness placing you at the house.
Jason Ross's assailant used the same language.<eos> You got that report?<eos> I have seen him before. A few days ago.<eos> He's the security guard that came into my office during a fire alarm.<eos> Okay, let's just say that your story is true, and this mystery man is Montgomery's fixer, who broke into your office to frame you.
Who won?<eos> Oh, it isn't over yet.<eos> Agent Rollins, this is our child specialist.<eos> - Agent Bennigan. - Hello.<eos> Your reputation precedes you.
There's one last thing that I need to say.<eos> I met a woman in the elevator this morning.<eos> And we hardly exchanged more than a few words... but she made a big impression on me.<eos> She's standing right there.<eos> Look, lady, I don't even know your name... but you set off a fire inside of me I have not been able to put out... since the moment I laid eyes on you.
And you don't know the rules.<eos> - Do you, Mr. Lyle?<eos> - I thought I did.<eos> But the stakes are too high.<eos> Let me escort you home, please.
I can spot a good business deal in the dark with a blindfold on.<eos> It was obvious when you showed me your ledger that you were a man of means.<eos> More well-heeled than you let on.<eos> Which, of course, is the mark of a true gentleman.<eos> Well, God bless you, 'cause I never dared to dream that I would find such a perfect place for myself.
Ms. Mars, Mr. Gable is the president of the World Broadcasting Network.<eos> He is overseeing over 12 weekly hours of programming, not including the news.<eos> He only sees people by appointment, and today, like yesterday and the day before, you don't have one.<eos> Look, my darling, I have some new headshots.<eos> Why don't you leave me the picture and a contact number, and I'll be sure he calls you as soon as he sees them.
Current temperature is 73.<eos> Beautiful weather out there today.<eos> Dr. Buckley will be right with you, Mrs. Robinson.<eos> It's Mrs. Francis.<eos> Oh, the boys who dropped you off said that was your name.
Cassie, where the hell have you...<eos> I'm sorry, Rebekah, but you didn't leave me much choice.<eos> I told you, there's no escape.<eos> I had to turn to the only people I knew I could trust... And I told them that they had to deal with you.<eos> My only regret is that I didn't stop you before you killed one of our own, and now you have to be punished.
I'm not the police. You're not in court.<eos> My role is to protect children at risk.<eos> Who said MaIony's at risk?<eos> Your son's missed 2 months of school. Is that correct?<eos> The principal summoned you 3 times.
I ask him that all the timel<eos> He goes out in the morning, comes home at night, no idea where he's been.<eos> Never know when he'II be home. It stresses me out.<eos> For my private life...<eos> Awandering, truant teenager doesn't stress you out?
I found it on my own.<eos> You say anything? No.<eos> - Not to anyone? - No.<eos> I keep thinking about you.<eos> I got that, ma'am, but they told me to call you back.
$1,800 please.<eos> More than enough.<eos> Miss, your change...<eos> You dare to run away?<eos> Miss, should I call your family to pick you up?
Excuse me!<eos> Officers!<eos> She's mine.<eos> I've got her.<eos> Ms. Keene, I told you I'd take you outside.
She's on Myshkin.<eos> Just find a way back in.<eos> Yeah, roger that!<eos> It's her.<eos> - Ma'am let me help you with those please.
Thank you for releasing Mr. Corrigan. It means a great deal to us.<eos> And I'm sure a great deal to his loved ones.<eos> We all want the same things.<eos> This is just a first step.<eos> Mr. Litsky, my chief of staff, will escort you to the facilities.
Bonjour, Rene!<eos> I hear you want to do something impossible and dangerous, which is not surprising.<eos> I know it sounds stupid, but, uh, we need to reactivate our old science project to end this storm.<eos> I need a startup sequence.<eos> Okay, okay, I'm sending you.
- Ms. Jaymes, cream, no sugar.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Kurt, right?<eos> - Yes, ma'am.<eos> - Mr. dawes is waiting for you in his office.
She said she was going to phone someone to pick her up.<eos> Who was the last person she called?<eos> Er, I didn't get the call at the time.<eos> We were at the hospital.<eos> Miss Simons had called you several times over the last few days.
Well, no wonder you're confused.<eos> Our architect's Mr. Gerrard.<eos> Well, that's what I remembered.<eos> Well, it's a simple mistake to make.<eos> And surely, he corrected you when you addressed him?
That's not the way to solicit our support.<eos> I'm not soliciting.<eos> I'm demanding.<eos> I feel sorry for you, Claire.<eos> Your husband sends you to talk tough.
Don't confuse that with the burden the Commander in Chief faces.<eos> Francis has given the order to kill.<eos> He's buried soldiers he's put into harm's way.<eos> And every day, he wakes up bearing responsibilities you can't possibly imagine.<eos> They would crush you if they fell on your shoulders.
And, stage five, here.<eos> The culmination of all the events previous but with more intensity.<eos> The entity has gradually moved up into clear consciousness from the energy it's been building, and then things get violent.<eos> Mom!<eos> Sorry if I kept you waiting at all.
- Mr. Cleary?<eos> Miss Robertson.<eos> It's Mrs. Showalter now.<eos> Ah, right.<eos> How's holy matrimony treating you?
Ah, right.<eos> How's holy matrimony treating you?<eos> Fine.<eos> I was wondering if you could help me with something.<eos> I never pictured you for a repeating customer.
So...<eos> So I may have no position at all at the new hospital?<eos> What about Negro patients?<eos> Our people can entertain you and you shower them with platitudes, but in the end you are no different from the rest of them.<eos> Mrs. Edwards, I believe we've heard enough out of you.
- I have to go talk to her, okay?<eos> I'm just gonna be-- l'll be right back.<eos> Everything's fine.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Do you know why I pulled you over?
Oh, fuck off.<eos> How is Jonah being up there less conspicuous than me?<eos> We're going to have a patrol car pulling up for indecent exposure.<eos> I'm trying to concentrate.<eos> The offences we arrested you for in public bear no relation to the charges you now face.
That was not me.<eos> We know it wasn't.<eos> How did you meet Joseph Raphael?<eos> He was your line manager at Pharmadansk.<eos> And you know his signature was on the document accusing you of theft?
We know it wasn't.<eos> How did you meet Joseph Raphael?<eos> He was your line manager at Pharmadansk.<eos> And you know his signature was on the document accusing you of theft?<eos> He framed you.
I merely say that WERE the mines to unite and create a company - one that would bid, buy, refine and sell their own products - they might keep the profit for themselves instead of handing it to the Warleggans.<eos> (Absolute genius! )<eos> May I be of service to you, ma'am?<eos> My name is Poldark.<eos> Did Verity send you?
~ He loves me.<eos> ~ I wish you could have this too.<eos> Don't waste another moment on such thoughts.<eos> Did Verity send you?
Uh, uh, uh, that's just not possible, r-right, Lindsay?<eos> Ma'am, I know that sometimes it's hard to point fingers.<eos> Well, I would say, like most of us, Marcus has a dark side.<eos> You mean a dark side aside from the side that wears women's dresses?<eos> You're hiding something. Your bangs betray you.
A personal matter.<eos> Did you discuss religion?<eos> Did you know that Mr. Rasal had sponsored a bill that would make certain religious practices illegal?<eos> Everyone knew how my father felt about religion.<eos> Several witnesses testified that they've seen you
To my baby girl.<eos> I love you.<eos> - I love you too.<eos> - To my new baby boy.<eos> - I love you already.
it is the physiological elevation of sexual engagement, Mr Keller.<eos> Usually expressed in increased blood flow to genitals, muscle tension.<eos> Think of it as what the body does in response to sexual interest.<eos> And you're not gonna find it in Taber's Dictionary because we coined the term ourselves.<eos> What in your background, Mrs Johnson, qualifies you to make up new medical terms?
And I need you to excuse my absence tonight.<eos> Oh. With The Little, Brown man?<eos> How am I supposed to do that?<eos> Mrs. Johnson.<eos> I was beginning to think we'd never see you again.
Thank you, Mrs. O'Neal.<eos> If it didn't get so dark so early...<eos> I understand.<eos> I'll be back, Ma.<eos> So we'll see you again Thursday?
Don't forget to wear your school colors tomorrow.<eos> Go, Carmel!<eos> Well, just tell your husband what I tell mine.<eos> "That's what you get for marrying a blonde."<eos> The principal will see you now.
It's all right.<eos> I appreciate the difficulty of investigating your boss's life.<eos> You don't need to be here to run this investigation;<eos> all you need is a cell phone.<eos> Why don't we take you to a safe house?
Because...<eos> Because he was my friend.<eos> And because I wanted to run away with him.<eos> What I said before I will say again, which is something you cannot say:<eos> that I did not warn you.
What was his attitude to your complaint?<eos> "You were asking for it."<eos> Because of... what you do for a living?<eos> No... cos I'm a woman.<eos> This client who raped you.
Didn't talk as if he knew him.<eos> Didn't seem that interested in him, actually.<eos> Well...<eos> As I recall from your statement, that rape was pretty violent.<eos> And even that didn't make Walter Nunn take you seriously?
~ This isn't Leeds, though, is it?<eos> If you could just bear with us, cos this is quite important.<eos> ~ Not to me, pet.<eos> ~ Excuse me!<eos> Do you mind answering my question, or do you want us to take you in?
I was with Gemma all night.<eos> You seem very confident of her.<eos> We love one another... and neither of us tells lies.<eos> Tina.<eos> Did Inspector Nunn persuade you to drop a rape complaint that you made two years ago?
Sit down.<eos> Tina...<eos> When you were raped two years ago... it was a Thursday night, wasn't it?<eos> (Aye.)<eos> Was this the man who raped you that night?
- Tortoiseshell is a combination of colors.<eos> - Quite.<eos> Ladies, if you'll excuse me for a moment, I think I'll have an answer for you very shortly.<eos> Ah. Well, there you are, Mrs Edwards.<eos> - Nobody was accusing you of anything.
She's seeing people who are not there.<eos> - And here I am, tied up for no reason, a concerned citizen just walking past, and I-- and I hear a cry for help.<eos> No, you're a Gerhardt.<eos> And you're shit on my shoe.<eos> Why don't you come here and let me wipe you off?
Just don't be offended next time if I don't say hello before I shoot.<eos> - Geez! - Hmm?<eos> Karl Weathers, that is a good way to get yourself shot!<eos> Your lesser half gave us a key, asked us to look out for you and the little one while he's gone.<eos> Do I strike you as someone who needs lookin' after?
That's your real selfie.<eos> I don't know what to do, Kimmy.<eos> Julian left Tokyo for Beijing.<eos> He won't take my calls.<eos> If you think your husband's cheating on you, you have to confront him.
Why would I risk it all by harboring a fugitive?<eos> Because to you, she's not a fugitive. She's the love of your life.<eos> [ scoffs ] I am a happily married woman.<eos> All the more reason To keep your terrorist sex pet hidden away.<eos> But the real secret is, she's two-timing you -- With a man. I know.
So it would have to be a bigger reason than that to leave the lass in town in tears...<eos> Were you angry with her, hm?<eos> Or him?<eos> No.<eos> You see, love, it's plausible we can place you in the car park at the time of death.
How's it look?<eos> It'll be gone in a week or two.<eos> - There's a game Sunday.<eos> - You're a cheerleader?<eos> One of the patrol officers recognized you.
Alprazolam, one milligram, four times a day.<eos> Metoprolol, 10 milligrams, once a day.<eos> It's going great with your mom. Uh-huh. Is it possible I might get an advance on next week's?<eos> And possibly the week after?<eos> I won't be needing you that long.
Hello?<eos> Oh, hey, Ms. Jensen.<eos> What?<eos> He's not there?<eos> Um, okay, let me, uh... [sighs] let me make a quick call, and, uh, I-I'll call you back.
Previously on The Messengers...<eos> We need to find and stop the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.<eos> War, Pestilence, Famine and Death.<eos> If those Four Horsemen succeed in breaking the seals, we can all kiss humanity good-bye.<eos> Sergeant Andrews will escort you to your car.
I want to run some more tests, but I will say that a hematoma that size should not just appear overnight.<eos> I probably just bumped into something without realizing it, that's all.<eos> You need to be admitted to a hospital.<eos> This could be serious, and until we figure out what's going on, I want you monitored.<eos> I can have an ambulance transfer you to the nearest cardiology lab if you don't have someone who can drive you.
I think our best option is to take her into the field with us.<eos> No, your best option is to not believe a word that she says.<eos> It's served me well for many years.<eos> It's only temporary.<eos> And we'll be supervising you the entire time.
This is only your first day back on the floor.<eos> That patient could've died.<eos> She didn't die, Jackie. She didn't die.<eos> Oh, ahem, excuse me, ma'am.<eos> - Is this guy bugging you?
What the hell?<eos> I won't steal it!<eos> Where's his coat?<eos> Here!<eos> Your boys will soon dump you!
Where on earth have you been?<eos> !<eos> Am I your wife?<eos> ~ Of course you're my wife.<eos> ~ 'Your husband,' he has sold you to me in exchange for a piece of wood.
Are we expecting company?<eos> Wrong floor.<eos> Will?<eos> He's under the table, Jack.<eos> Your husband left you behind.
If you could just excuse me for two minutes.<eos> You're right.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Scent really is deeply lodged in memory.<eos> Even blind, I think I'd have recognized you.
- Mr Vasseur?<eos> - Yes?<eos> Ms Masson, Private Banking. Did you get my messages?<eos> Yes.<eos> Sorry, I was going to call you back.
God, I... I can't believe this happened.<eos> It sounds like she was very special to you.<eos> Trust me, Detective, I had no illusions about our relationship.<eos> Detective Flynn?<eos> I thought I saw you at the church.
- Oh, yeah, most around here do.<eos> - I'm surprised you don't, actually.<eos> - I'm not... from here, originally.<eos> I mean, I was born here, but... that was a while ago.<eos> So, what brings you back here?
Company gets caught up in a scandal, files for bankruptcy, then quietly restructures under a new name.<eos> They killed Daniel Fisher.<eos> They tried to kill me.<eos> I'm still a little unclear on that point.<eos> You say here Rance assaulted you in your apartment.
And the Dream Team won the lottery?<eos> Of course.<eos> - Craig took his share.<eos> - Yes.<eos> You could have had your share and been a million pounds richer if they hadn't thrown you out.
Ketamine.<eos> I use it to tranquillise the animals.<eos> It's lethal in sufficient quantities, especially mixed with alcohol.<eos> Yeah, Terry hasn't stopped drinking since he came back from the flat.<eos> - What did he hit you with?
But that's harassment.<eos> Once you're on the wrong side of Detective Cornell, that's where you stay.<eos> Confess now and get it over with.<eos> Mr. Crawford.<eos> Somebody called you?
Let get you outside. Okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay, and this is your direct number or your assistant's?<eos> That's my cell phone.<eos> Okay, look, I'm gonna get Officer Krebbs to take you where you need to go.
I can talk to you about my fee schedule, which is very reasonable.<eos> I think we'll need to discuss everything before we do anything official.<eos> Can we get back to you?<eos> Uh, okay.<eos> I'll just - - I'll leave this information here with you.
That guy was violent.<eos> I wanted it if things got out of hand, which they did, big time.<eos> Keep going.<eos> I swapped sex for drugs with Matt before, so I used that to get back in.<eos> Mr. Skokie let you back into his home?
Please.<eos> I'd much rather honesty than praise.<eos> Braver than I am, then.<eos> Mr Sargent says all my things are too grey.<eos> I thought I saw you at the painting schools.
You yourself are unfinished.<eos> At your age, one passes through many phases, and as an artist, many styles, until one finds what suits.<eos> And until a phase passes, the sympathy of true friends is a wonderful thing.<eos> I shall set your aunt's mind at rest.<eos> I wish I could see what it is that so beguiles you.
I didn't want to tell you.<eos> I just knew you'd...<eos> I tried to talk her out of it!<eos> You see, I don't understand.<eos> If Alison injured you on purpose, why wouldn't you want to report it?
Anyway, I'm the one that saw the killer leaving. Remember?<eos> Er, yes.<eos> Your jog.<eos> We checked the footage of the CCTV at the entrance.<eos> We never saw you.
What?<eos> No.<eos> What about your freedom, sunlight, birds, free cocoa at the police station.<eos> I don't expect you to understand, but I'm used to a certain lifestyle.<eos> He cheated on you.
That's a terribly cynical way to live.<eos> - Well, I have my reasons.<eos> - Really?<eos> What are they? Come.<eos> Cast your burden on the lord, and he will sustain you.
We had sex one time.<eos> And then you made your way home.<eos> Yes.<eos> That's when I noticed that he was following me.<eos> Mr. Lahey followed you home that night?
We had sex one time.<eos> And then you made your way home.<eos> Yes.<eos> That's when I noticed that he was following me.<eos> Mr. Lahey followed you home that night?
I have worked very hard on my relationships in order to get this done for you.<eos> And I am not gonna be having Cookie messing this up.<eos> She's not.<eos> She's stoked about it.<eos> Okay. Well, what exactly did Cookie promise you when you signed with her?
Are you always so forthright?<eos> Always.<eos> Perhaps I shouldn't be.<eos> On the contrary, it's refreshing.<eos> I haven't seen you at Wragby before.
Pure, sparky, fearless new life.<eos> I'd love to touch one.<eos> Yeah, reckon I'm a bit more thick-skinned.<eos> Hello.<eos> Reckon he's took you for his mother.
Clifford, I...<eos> Get away.<eos> Get away.<eos> Get away from me!<eos> The car will take you off the estate.
‚ô™ Like a bird on the wing ‚ô™<eos> ‚ô™ I'll let my spirit fly ‚ô™<eos> ‚ô™ let my spirit fly... ‚ô™<eos> It's good you don't feel.<eos> God blessed you that way.
Leslie Thompkins.<eos> Dr. Thompkins.<eos> You work here?<eos> I'm not an inmate.<eos> I haven't seen you on infirmary duty before.
What's green and then red?<eos> Frogs in a blender.<eos> Walk away, Nygma.<eos> Walk away.<eos> I'm very sorry if I've offended you, Miss Kringle.
And these things, they usually run, what, an hour?<eos> - Mm-hmm. - So, you could... maybe go to dinner... afterwards.<eos> Hypothetically.<eos> Hypothetically.<eos> Well, I'm gonna keep working the case, and I'm gonna call you if I feel the need to go to this meeting.
But I can see tears...<eos> on your face. Is it because your friend Detective Flass was arrested?<eos> What do you need, Mr. Nygma?<eos> Yes.<eos> I've been suspended... and won't be seeing you anymore.
I'll tell you what.<eos> I'm going to shoot you in the stomach.<eos> You'll feel pressure at first.<eos> Then you'll feel an intense burning like you've never felt in your life.<eos> Maybe that will properly motivate you to be honest with me.
Dollmaker.<eos> So you'd rather take your own life than end up one of my creations?<eos> Yes.<eos> Well, Ms. Mooney..., try anything like this again, and your nightmare will come true.<eos> I will bring you back from the dead, if I have to... and make you into something the world has never seen.
You two with me, yeah.<eos> ...she did a lot of homework to do with CSEs and O Levels.<eos> She babysat for local people with children.<eos> She loved all the children.<eos> Sorry to disturb you.
Mrs. Kruger... oh.<eos> I hear you're having some trouble with your wrist.<eos> - May I just take...<eos> - I don't think I'm ready for that.<eos> Uh, well, it's sort of hard for me to treat you if I don't know what's wrong.
W-well, I thought it was a good idea to come, but I've-I've changed my mind.<eos> Well, you have an ailment, and you're in a hospital, so you're in the right place, okay?<eos> N-no, don't touch me!<eos> Okay, Helen, let's make a deal.<eos> If I leave you alone for a minute, do you promise not to leave?
No, Maggie, this is good.<eos> If you want her to open up to you, you should open up to her.<eos> Thank you, Dr. Dey.<eos> No fun being interrogated, is it?<eos> No one was interrogating you, Helen.
You don't want to betray his trust.<eos> He and I have an agreement.<eos> I understand. I shouldn't pry.<eos> I'll leave you be, then.<eos> He said he loves you more than anything.
You are literally giving your blood.<eos> Plenty of people give blood who aren't married to politicians.<eos> Very few people campaign for someone who just fired them.<eos> He tell you that?<eos> He said he betrayed you.
Good luck to you, Suzie.<eos> Mrs. Underwood, did she change her mind?<eos> No, she stuck to her guns.<eos> But you can't blame a woman for having conviction.<eos> - The president just called for you.
Y'all want to meet me in the car?<eos> Okay. We'll wait.<eos> Oh, how sweet.<eos> Just one big happy family, huh?<eos> - Nobody's expecting you?
Oh, that's great.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> I feel like you're judging me.<eos> You have no right to judge me.<eos> Miss devore, no one is judging you.
No.<eos> No.<eos> You've got to be kidding me.<eos> Step out of the car, please.<eos> Do you know why I pulled you over, ma'am?
~ No.<eos> ~ You didn't see Nigel Carter.<eos> ~ You saw Joe Miller.<eos> ~ No!<eos> But you want to pin the blame on the son who's rejected you.
Maybe you're right.<eos> Or maybe my last chance at finding out the truth about Aaron's death just blew up alongside Kyle Green.<eos> What is it, David?<eos> As soon as the secret service allows, you'll need to address the nation.<eos> I've assembled the joint chiefs to present you with a strategy.
That explains why you spelled "Xanthippe" wrong.<eos> No.<eos> Wrong.<eos> Stop.<eos> The point is, we tricked you earlier.
What's your name?<eos> I'm Detective Angie Flynn.<eos> Uh, Ella.<eos> Ella Rollins.<eos> Well, Ella, I can make arrangements for a car to take you down to the station, okay?
So, how about we get to whatever it is you summoned me here for so I can get back and nurse my affliction.<eos> - What? What is so funny?<eos> - Ava, you picked the wrong morning to show up half in the bag.<eos> Good morning, Ms. Crowder.<eos> Hope we didn't pull you away from anything too pressing.
Remember, one false move, you're dead.<eos> So have fun.<eos> Evening, Ms. Thompson.<eos> Hello, Dave.<eos> What brings you around so late?
No.<eos> There is another matter.<eos> Not as fraught as the last, I hope.<eos> Possibly.<eos> Miss Borden, would it be all right if I called on you from time to time?
I want to be done with you for good.<eos> And that?<eos> It's for my own protection.<eos> From me?<eos> Oh, you're god damn right from you, should you think of sending me off like everyone else whoever looked at you funny.
Wouldn't you be?<eos> I don't know what I'd be.<eos> Hard to imagine.<eos> Hard to forget.<eos> How'd the Shlottmans find you?
It's my job to know things.<eos> I know that Jack was denied worker's comp because he stole the ambulance.<eos> They got it back.<eos> If I could understand what happened, I may be able to pull some strings and reverse the ruling.<eos> Maybe God sent you.
Do you think rubber bands just buy themselves, Miss Jones?<eos> Last week it was a 20-foot paper clip chain, and it's been reported that you've been taking six-packs of Diet Coke home from the employee kitchen.<eos> Two.<eos> I took two cans.<eos> If you're lucky, they won't fire you.
- Really?<eos> - Yep.<eos> Such a pair of tonsils, that girl!<eos> I mean, I didn't get a lick of sleep for those first few months.<eos> Well, I hope our caterwauling hasn't kept you up.
You are done with this.<eos> - It was dark and...<eos> - Yes.<eos> You'll have to wait.<eos> Someone will be with you in a minute.
You don't have any allergies?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Take this.<eos> More.<eos> Ah, Mrs. Duteil, I hadn't seen you today.
Yeah, that's it... our wills, trust funds for the kids, our prenup.<eos> You know what's in here.<eos> If you instigate the divorce, you leave with nothing.<eos> I know.<eos> That's why I hired you.
Is there any procedure for that?<eos> No, I'll tell the director.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> To be perfectly honest, I really wanted to know what kind of person Dr Yabuuchi would be married to.<eos> You're exactly how I imagined you.
And talk about manning up...<eos> Stokes assaulted you, and you released him, and I'm the pussy?<eos> And then he attacks me, and you don't have the balls to back me? Not what happened.<eos> You screwed up.<eos> Fuck you.
I hope you can help me.<eos> I've got a message for Lady Mary from the Dowager. She says it's urgent.<eos> If you give it to me, I'll get someone to take it to her.<eos> Lady Grantham said I was to put it into Lady Mary's hand.<eos> I'm sorry, miss, but we don't know you, and Lady Mary isn't down yet. I'm Ellen Gorse.
I'm sorry, miss, but we don't know you, and Lady Mary isn't down yet. I'm Ellen Gorse.<eos> I've just started at the Dower House.<eos> I've only got to give her an envelope.<eos> Very well.<eos> I'll take you to her room.
Mrs Crawley, I'm sure you don't intend to be offensive...<eos> No, but I intend to be truthful.<eos> I'm the Almoner.<eos> I know the facts about this place as well as you.<eos> So, this isn't something Lord Merton has persuaded you into? - Lord Merton?
That, in my eyes, she is beautiful.<eos> I see.<eos> You say she asks if I want a full marriage, and the answer is<eos> yes, I do.<eos> I want a real marriage, a true marriage, with everything that that involves. And I hope I do not ask the indelicate when I send you back to relay this message.
She'll serve time for manslaughter.<eos> She won't hang. So Mr Green goes on ruining lives.<eos> But not your life.<eos> Not any more.<eos> I'm sorry for what we've put you through, Mrs Bates.
Like, he was just so happy to be living the life he was living.<eos> Like, he appreciated it more because of how hard he had to work for it.<eos> He was special.<eos> [Chuckles] Different. [Thud]<eos> [Sniffles] And after he dropped you off, what did you do?
- Call me back.<eos> - I will.<eos> - Ben Crawford.<eos> - Mr. Crawford.<eos> - Did Elaine call you?
He... he put his hands on me and he shook me.<eos> - Did you see Abby Crawford today?<eos> - No. I never had Abby.<eos> No matter what Ben says, I didn't do anything wrong.<eos> I'm not blaming you, Mrs. Murphy.
- Did you see Abby Crawford today?<eos> - No. I never had Abby.<eos> No matter what Ben says, I didn't do anything wrong.<eos> I'm not blaming you, Mrs. Murphy.<eos> If you'd like to file a complaint against Mr. Crawford, I'll take your statement and then we'll go down to the hospital, where they'll examine you and will document your injuries and get a rape kit.
And he invited himself into my house.<eos> And then what happened?<eos> And then he raped me.<eos> He ran away in the morning, but he broke into my house and accused me of killing my own son.<eos> So, he raped you, and then he spent the entire night sleeping next to you?
And then he raped me.<eos> He ran away in the morning, but he broke into my house and accused me of killing my own son.<eos> So, he raped you, and then he spent the entire night sleeping next to you?<eos> You realize that by falsifying a police report, you make it incredibly difficult for any woman who has been raped to come forward.<eos> So, if you want to pursue this and I find out that you've lied, I'll not only charge you, but I'll make sure that you serve every single day of that sentence.
You didn't expect this, did you, that you'll have to pay the price, too?<eos> On your knees.<eos> It ruins your life, too, Oleg.<eos> I have immunity.<eos> They'll get you for it.
What is it you wish for in a wife, sir?<eos> When I marry, one day... and before too long... I must know in my heart that I can trust my wife to do her duty.<eos> I would do the bidding of any man I loved.<eos> I am sure, sir, you will meet your match soon.<eos> And what man, except a fool, would not love you, Seymour?
Sheriff Leena Reyes.<eos> And you are?<eos> Katrina Crane.<eos> Ichabod has a wife?<eos> He never mentioned you.
Turned out, he was taking quite a bit of money out of the football program.<eos> Do you have any idea what he'd do with it?<eos> No, I never knew anything about that.<eos> Did he make any large purchases recently?<eos> Surprise you with a diamond, a new car?
From now on I will be called "Ms. commander"!<eos> This is my deputy, lieutenant seleznev.<eos> These are the instructors.<eos> Alexei kolokolchikov and yefim zadorozhnyy.<eos> They will train you.. And prepare you for the final test.
We funded the construction of your gym.<eos> Ah, you must come back later if you wish to see it.<eos> The men are using it right now.<eos> Actually, I'm here to see the imam.<eos> Is he expecting you?
I'm sure he'll find time for me.<eos> Sheikh Hafiz Al Haria is a very famous scholar.<eos> Please tell him it's urgent.<eos> Please wait here.<eos> Sheikh Hafiz will see you.
And that just worked.<eos> Do you want to track down the van, break back into it, and return these meds, or can we just deliver them and be done with it?<eos> Fine. Let's just get this over with.<eos> Wes, it's me, we got the stuff.<eos> Where do we meet you?
We know James Manning was nosing around them, trying to find out who sabotaged his plane.<eos> Perhaps that's where he met this mystery woman.<eos> Does that match our ticket?<eos> Yes, Miss.<eos> This ticket will get you there.
Oh, I can pay ya.<eos> Look.<eos> That's just a down payment.<eos> You'll get the rest once you find Ned.<eos> Dr Macmillan is on the telephone for you, Miss Fisher.
~ Well, I...<eos> That's a lovely necklace, a very expensive one.<eos> I wouldn't know.<eos> Was it a present?<eos> Did your work take you to my father's room last night?
Someone's after you, aren't they?<eos> You're afraid.<eos> (Cracks knuckles) I'm sorry, Constable Martin, if I've done anything to give you the wrong idea, but...<eos> Call me Neville, please.<eos> I know you're engaged, but you're not married yet, and this fellow's gone off and left you, and... .. and I can't help how I feel.
You're afraid.<eos> (Cracks knuckles) I'm sorry, Constable Martin, if I've done anything to give you the wrong idea, but...<eos> Call me Neville, please.<eos> I know you're engaged, but you're not married yet, and this fellow's gone off and left you, and... .. and I can't help how I feel.<eos> You're like a flower, and when I held you in my arms...
Hello,nameplease?<eos> Uh, Hannah.<eos> Oh,g 'day,Hannah. How can we help you?<eos> Um, I need-- my phone's been cut off. I forgot to pay the bill.<eos> Okay. Letme transfer you to billing.
Consider my request withdrawn, even though I never actually asked it in the first place<eos> - and not in the way...<eos> - The way in which you had planned?<eos> I'm not a piece on your chessboard, Major.<eos> I never saw you as such, Miss Shippen.
You don't think it was a mistake?<eos> Not at all.<eos> It's the bravest thing I seen in my life.<eos> Anika Calhoun to see Billy Beretti.<eos> Is he expecting you?
Where your grandfather?<eos> Lucious!<eos> Lucious!<eos> Lucious.<eos> She playing' you.
Lucious don't care about nobody but himself.<eos> Well, it's my job to study people.<eos> - Study me.<eos> - Watch yourself.<eos> And the way he looks at you... Whatever that is, that's too intense.
I got kids, Fortune. I can't get caught up in this.<eos> He... he's lying.<eos> Don't blame him.<eos> We've gotten a number of complaints from your neighbors.<eos> Why don't you go get dressed, we'll take you down to the station house, and get this over with?
Nothing illegal about it.<eos> But you do charge four times more than your competitors, right?<eos> Quality comes with a price.<eos> Yeah, well, so does being an accessory to murder, okay?<eos> So you're either gonna tell us who Brooke went home with last night, or we're gonna book you right now for withholding evidence.
Keep your phone on. Mmm.<eos> Jordan.<eos> Breathe.<eos> If she's here, we'll find her.<eos> I can't remember if I told Zoey "I love you" the last time I saw her.
Very well.<eos> - Good day.<eos> - Have you word of the major?<eos> Have they requested a ransom?<eos> This is news best heard by you alone, Your Honor.
He's on Long Island with my former mistress.<eos> You must miss him terribly.<eos> Mrs. Strong.<eos> To what do I owe the pleasure?<eos> Or have I perhaps offended you in some new way that I am as yet unaware of?
You're wrong. She would have.<eos> I'm telling you this but in fact... I wasn't listening.<eos> I kept thinking of you.<eos> I spent the dinner watching you.<eos> I hadn't seen you in a month.
That's it.<eos> Settle it there.<eos> Major Hewlett.<eos> Oh, Mrs. Strong.<eos> I'm sorry, I didn't see you there.
- Yes.<eos> Named after Halley himself.<eos> Well, Edmund... it's getting late.<eos> Yes.<eos> My men will escort you home.
He takes all the senior citizens at the retirement home that he works at and they come in here, and they don't pay for a thing.<eos> Well, excuse me for caring about old folks whose families have abandoned them.<eos> They have?<eos> Now, don't you listen to him, Mrs. Bosma.<eos> Your daughter loves you very much.
But I'm now gonna get back to work.<eos> Hey, captain, you want to jump down, or are you good up there? Shit!<eos> We're gonna need a new Yoko.<eos> Okay.<eos> Will anyone else be joining you today?
- Exactly.<eos> It's doing the work of his lungs so they can heal.<eos> - When can we see him?<eos> - We're still pretty busy In there adjusting his anti-coagulant dosage.<eos> - Don't let us hold you up.
This is Katherine Hale.<eos> Please leave a message.<eos> Miss Hale, this is Mike Cosmatopolis.<eos> Please call me as soon as you get this.<eos> Believe I have something that might interest you.
Oh!<eos> Don't you just love it?<eos> I saw it in the window at FAO Schwarz and I said, "that's for my baby!"<eos> Wait!<eos> Let me help you with that.
- Good.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Oh, Mother.<eos> I could feel myself falling.<eos> What stopped you?
- Yeah.<eos> Oh, Mother.<eos> I could feel myself falling.<eos> What stopped you?<eos> Marilyn. What stopped you?
There you go, I got it.<eos> There you go.<eos> SOFIA: Mr. Castle!<eos> Miss Del Cordova, I...<eos> Uh... We were not expecting you.
I'll take care of it.<eos> Yeah, yeah, I gotta go.<eos> Fuck.<eos> So I just give this to my Bio teacher and I get out early?<eos> Yeah, and I'll see you in the gym seventh period.
Bridget!<eos> Put that on.<eos> She may not even let me in there.<eos> They may shoot me on sight.<eos> I want this on record that I warned you.
Haven't had me a decent crap for a week.<eos> Couple hours on the cut will get you uncorked.<eos> Good man.<eos> Mrs. Palmer!<eos> Never imagined seeing you here in Laramie.
It's Norma Bates.<eos> Is Bob there, please?<eos> It's about the pool.<eos> I need to see some designs.<eos> He's out the office at a meeting right now, but I'll have him call you back, Ms. Bates.
Are you Beau?<eos> I want to know who's asking.<eos> Jamie Nelson.<eos> I'm your nephew's attorney.<eos> The media follow you?
- Nice to meet you.<eos> And you must be Detective Rizzoli.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Hi. - Ah.<eos> Senior criminalist Chang, she, uh ... well, um, she holds you in very high regard.
- So you told him about the cheating?<eos> - Well, I thought if ... if he knew, then he'd realize how much I l-loved him.<eos> But he said that he had to come clean.<eos> - Confess.<eos> - Which would have exposed you.
I have, uh, trouble recognizing people's faces.<eos> It's called facial recognition blindness.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> If you were to walk away, I wouldn't recognize you when you came back.
- So Simms was the killer's target.<eos> And Elliot was his hapless, not really an eye-witness.<eos> That bric setup is impressive.<eos> Yeah, we've made a lot of improvements this year.<eos> - Oh. - I haven't seen you around.
I got to go.<eos> I'm on triple platinum overtime from all these shifts.<eos> Finish your beer, relax, and then just get back at it.<eos> ‚ô™ be brave ‚ô™<eos> Hey, uh... I'll trade you for a cup of coffee.
Mine did.<eos> - It was like a nightmare.<eos> - Well, like you said... this isn't the Dark Ages.<eos> Not here at least.<eos> Okay, I'm gonna take you to the Well Woman waiting room.
What, did you bang your head on the steering wheel?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Got anyone?<eos> - What?<eos> - You got anyone to pick you up?
She cried... saying she's sorry.<eos> "GRADUATION"<eos> Obviously, I dropped out of school.<eos> I was never allowed a normal life.<eos> - May I help you?
- I was staying.<eos> - No, you weren't staying.<eos> No women.<eos> - I'll call you.<eos> - Yeah, he'll call you.
They don't technically live together.<eos> That is not the case.<eos> Whatever your arrangement, you're here because Tessa skipped her afternoon classes two days ago, then showed up yesterday with a forged note-- again!<eos> I'm considering all disciplinary action, including barring Tessa from tomorrow night's homecoming dance.<eos> I know your work keeps you very busy, Mrs. Johnson, but please remember children learn by example.
Ursula:<eos> No! It's about me.<eos> Hook told me what you asked him to do.<eos> You were trying to take away the only thing I have left of mother.<eos> So I wouldn't lose you the way I lost her.
- I'm going home, Lily!<eos> I left Ceylon after some stupid argument with my parents.<eos> All I want is to make things right.<eos> Surely you won't go straightaway, though?<eos> My one regret is that I won't get to know YOU properly.
Good girl.<eos> Hi.<eos> I-I am so sorry for the intrusion, but,<eos> I'm a patient of Dr. Godfrey's...<eos> was... is... am, but I saw you in the market yesterday and I recognized you from the photo on his desk.
Am I leaving too?<eos> No, you're staying here.<eos> Alone?<eos> No, dear.<eos> I would never leave you alone.
No.<eos> W... will I ever see him again?<eos> Grown rather fond of him, have you?<eos> We've just been through so much together.<eos> Just so you know, I never really approved of him throwing you in the dungeon like that.
Don't you want me to stay?<eos> You heard. He's stable.<eos> Leave me. I need to be alone.<eos> We'll finish the film, then you and me are over.<eos> They said I'd find you here.
You must be Marie.<eos> Yes.<eos> I found your number in his phone.<eos> I didn't know who to call.<eos> I figured since he mentions you so often...
But the agreement was you had to make your fortune - that was your word, too.<eos> The fortune I have to offer is worth more than money can buy.<eos> You will marry me and with great willingness of spirit.<eos> You were romantically involved with Mr. Smythe, is that right?<eos> Must've been very upsetting when he jilted you.
And what is the nature of your sin?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yes, you do. It's weakness.<eos> God buried an atom under a million tons of rock so that America could split it in two and redraw the maps of the world.<eos> And you want to run off to Dayton because some girl didn't ask you to the prom?
Yeah, I've got a pulse but its weak.<eos> He's lost a lot of blood from his head wound.<eos> Help me, please!<eos> Please, help me!<eos> Hang in there, lady, we're getting you out.
My lighter.<eos> I was wondering whose it was.<eos> I found it on the driveway after the explosion.<eos> It doesn't make any sense.<eos> Madame Chania, I'm arresting you on suspicion of murder.
Come on.<eos> Sit down.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> I owe her everything.<eos> She used you.
Perhaps it was easier to go along with it than to accept the truth?<eos> My son is dead, isn't he?<eos> Yes.<eos> But why didn't you tell the truth straightaway?<eos> Nobody would have blamed you.
14-5-2?<eos> Try that?<eos> An early death would be too good for you.<eos> The police will be arriving soon.<eos> I wouldn't want them to find you here.
Fine, I'll kill her, then.<eos> It's over.<eos> We got what we came for.<eos> Hey.<eos> If we take you back to Fall River to face the law, you'll confess it?
Just not today.<eos> Let her have today.<eos> Your mother was such a vibrant woman, even after your father ran off with that man.<eos> Thank you, Mrs. Mcgruder.<eos> I'm sure we'll see you at the funeral.
That would've given the press something to write about.<eos> She only took a swig.<eos> Wouldn't have made her collapse.<eos> Then the strychnine must already have been in the water...<eos> Angelica Francis, I am arresting you on suspicion of murder.
Not at all.<eos> Wretched juniper.<eos> I was pruning when a branch snapped back and hit me in the face.<eos> Nasty.<eos> And so thorny, you're lucky it didn't scratch you to ribbons.
But something this traumatic takes time to process.<eos> Bits and pieces come back slowly.<eos> You're framing Neil,<eos> Bits and pieces that what he told you?<eos> May I ask who referred you to this therapist?
What type of partnership are you looking for?<eos> Combining my software with your compression algorithm will save me a lot of time and money and allow us to sell it at a lower price point to the consumer.<eos> If you're interested in partnering up on something so small, of course.<eos> Well, I imagine the boss will be as impressed as I am with what you've created.<eos> So, um, why don't I call you once he weighs in?
Have your boys put the word out on the street that you found me.<eos> Dominic will have no choice but to reach out to make a deal.<eos> Then you leave the rest up to me.<eos> Nice job, Ms. Harper.<eos> The cartel took you straight to Dominic's stronghold, just as you thought.
It's money I was owed.<eos> She's always dumping that kid on me.<eos> It's why I moved to New York in the first place.<eos> So you just leave a 13-year-old kid in the streets, thinking that you're dead?<eos> That boy loves you.
Do you know who took her?<eos> I know nothing.<eos> I want to go home.<eos> I just want Emma to come home.<eos> I'll find someone to drive you home.
Each one of these loans has the power to change lives and families.<eos> And in some cases, entire villages.<eos> I have brought with me today as a guest to the hearing the woman who embodies the full potential of this program.<eos> Ms. Chuang.<eos> Uh, we won't be calling you today.
We're the same two people that you trusted Louis with in the first place.<eos> This whole thing is a nightmare.<eos> Do you realize I could lose my job?<eos> I have five cats to support.<eos> I know, and I-I feel terrible that we put you in this position.
Yeah, we got a different van every weekend for a month.<eos> Sounds like a smart guy trying to cover his tracks.<eos> [Tammy]: Jason can't know I was here.<eos> He's got a temper.<eos> Did he threaten you?
He let Hakam draw fire so he could run and hide and strike at us again.<eos> Charlie, I just lied to 320 million Americans.<eos> And the world.<eos> What do we do now?<eos> We don't make a liar out of you.
What happened?<eos> We were hoping you could help us figure that out.<eos> Me?<eos> We talked to some of your cycling club.<eos> They said Zack followed you.
I would not submit again to ownership by any man.<eos> I would not return to Charles Town.<eos> (people laughing) My name is Samuel Fraunces, but you can call me Black Sam, or Sam if you prefer.<eos> Now, I know you've never been here before, because I never forget a guest.<eos> And I know without a shadow of a doubt I have never met you before.
The rebels are better people.<eos> I don't trust the British.<eos> Hmm... (Claybourne): Miss Meena!<eos> - What is it, Claybourne?<eos> - There's a man... he's snooping around Canvas Town, and I think he's looking for you.
My boys spoke to one of Amber's coworkers.<eos> He said that their boss might know where Amber and Danny are.<eos> He also said that an old friend of hers came by the office this morning, asking the same question.<eos> We're trying to track down the boss.<eos> As soon as that information comes in, I'll get it to you.
Well, this is it.<eos> Wait, you... you expect me to-to walk?<eos> No, Master Bruce.<eos> I expect you to run.<eos> Miss Kringle, ever since I first laid eyes on you, I've felt this deep connection.
That's not gonna fly anymore.<eos> See, the thing is, recovering the body is not the only development in the case.<eos> I also found...<eos> Samuel Aleko.<eos> He places you at the scene, Agent Keen-- you and your ex-husband.
(ERNESTO) Door 148 is in a permanent time loop.<eos> You mean, like Groundhog Day, but in medieval times.<eos> All rise.<eos> For his excellence, inquisitor general don Tom√°s de Torquemada.<eos> I must send you on a mission I wish I never would've had to send you on.
- Whose plan was it?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> But... but she was having second thoughts about seeing Cole convicted for her murder.<eos> And she was thinking about coming forward.<eos> And that would have ruined you, which is why you killed her?
Or, as we call it, Saturday.<eos> Well, I'm planning a big Valentine's day Scavenger Hunt for Sue, and I need your help.<eos> Ohh. Really, Darrin?<eos> No, it's super-small... only 10 locations and a surprise at the end.<eos> So I'm gonna need you at a bench in the mall in a cowboy hat.
If you wait too long, you get too nervous.<eos> Actually, Brick, that's a good idea.<eos> Don't agree with me, mom.<eos> It wrecks my point.<eos> Look, the hardest part is trying to know whether or not she wants to kiss you, and you already know she does, so you're golden.
- Yes.<eos> - You won't be disappointed with the reward.<eos> Manager Sung?<eos> - Yes, Chairman.<eos> - Something bothering you?
I feel that it may be better to attack him instead. Chairman.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I won't be mean to her.<eos> You know me. I'm such a nice person that it's hard for people to refuse me.<eos> How good was I to you 14 years ago?
Nick was a good husband.<eos> Nick was a good husband?<eos> Every marriage has its ups and downs.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Was he cheating on you?
I'm not supposed to talk to you without my lawyer, you know.<eos> That's right.<eos> You don't have to talk to me.<eos> A cigarette butt was found at the crime scene that was never tested for DNA, so I had it sent to the lab.<eos> Puts you at the scene.
I know the type.<eos> Probably won't even use protection, right?<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> That's my responsibility.<eos> Look, despite what the congressman is saying, I just want you to know that I believe you.
You can't judge a book by its cover.<eos> It's a stretch, but it's all we got.<eos> Members only, sir.<eos> Hi, Justin.<eos> Oh, hi Ms. Webb, didn't see you.
You wanna join me?<eos> Davis Bennett isn't playing tonight.<eos> Really? Mm. You can take her back to the bar.<eos> Whatever happened to our private drink?<eos> Oh, Kenny will set you up.
Say hello to his or her proxy.<eos> We can't coordinate, but you can get to me through my associate.<eos> - About what?<eos> - Your PAC.<eos> The PAC that I set up in support of you.
I'm going to need to sit down with you again.<eos> Would you like to talk now?<eos> No, this is going to take a while.<eos> Could you talk to Agent Gaad about setting aside a few hours for us to meet sometime next week?<eos> I can pull someone from the secretarial pool to cover for you.
Wait. Are you here because you want to be my publicist?<eos> I just have a few questions for you.<eos> Of course.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> These men in your book did they violate you?
That's the right decision.<eos> If you give me $3 million.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> No, not you.<eos> I want $3 million from whoever hired you.
What you want is revenge, but not against the men in that manuscript.<eos> You're angry.<eos> - I'm not angry.<eos> - You are angry.<eos> At your ex-boss, Jim Sanders, the one who fired you.
Word got around that you were wild... a tiger in the sack.<eos> And he assumed that you wouldn't mind sleeping with him, too, but you said no.<eos> And that didn't go over well with Jim, did it?<eos> He fired you.<eos> And when you tried to get work elsewhere, he blackballed you, stole your ability to use your intellect because you would not have sex with him!
- It was for √Ç¬£6.40, made to the campus cafe at 1:35.<eos> - OK, go and check it out. - I'll go.<eos> DI Morton?<eos> Yeah, this is DCI Denmoor, SCD-11.<eos> - Got a message saying to ring you.
Why don't you go say hello to Ben and Zeus?<eos> They're in the car.<eos> - Oh, please do.<eos> - Tell the boys I said hello.<eos> So, the kids treating you all right, Annie?
Wait, why?<eos> You need to think long and hard about this story that you're telling.<eos> It's not a story.<eos> This is the truth.<eos> That the man you said you'd never met, a notorious criminal, had a mysterious relationship with the man who raised you?
I believe that each case, each criminal is somehow part of a larger agenda.<eos> What agenda?<eos> I can't be sure, but he always has an angle for every case.<eos> I know that.<eos> So Reddington is using you to expand his criminal empire.
Premium Bonds?<eos> Yeah, Mr. Mullen's mum bought them for him 30 years ago.<eos> - And he won?<eos> - Yeah, it's just sitting there unclaimed.<eos> Jacky's mum put you down as a contact.
- Our popularity is growing.<eos> - And you Russians are looking for.<eos> - It's good.<eos> - They want to kill you.<eos> - That's why I phoned you.
Twice.<eos> Bam Bam, I just--I'm so glad there's someone whose soul is still retrievable here, and thank you.<eos> Pepperoni pizza for a Mr. Bam Bam?<eos> (delivery man) Is there a Bam Bam?<eos> I told you to call me from downstairs and I'd meet you in the alley.
Not everything.<eos> You didn't tell us that you were lead counsel for Modesto Motors, and you didn't tell us about the airbags.<eos> You know, those airbags with the habit of putting holes in people, like Jody Evans.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Ms. Resner, why did Richie really call you the other day?
You set in motion a chain of events that cost an innocent man his life.<eos> What you did wasn't right.<eos> It wasn't necessary.<eos> It was a crime... way outside the lines of what we stand for.<eos> I came in here to say that I don't recognize you anymore.
It'll never work.<eos> - It's a chance.<eos> I didn't ask you for a chance.<eos> I asked you for an opinion.<eos> Which I gave you, which I'm giving you now, which you refuse to listen to.
And they in turn, requires me to control the movement of resistance.<eos> Achieving peace - not an easy task.<eos> If I be mistaken - I just replaced.<eos> You talk about a military conflict?<eos> Who will replace you?
How late?<eos> Just before Christmas.<eos> November, I think.<eos> I mean, it was just a few weeks.<eos> So Father Robert said to us that he thought you were erm... 19 or 20 when he met you.
Thought you'd like this one better.<eos> You fixed the taillight.<eos> Oh, yes, I fixed the taillight.<eos> Then I started lookin' at all her dirty parts.<eos> Your cam shaft had too much end play, so I gave you a new cam, heads, replaced the gaskets in your manifold and carburetor, and then I upgraded you to a 6 speed tranny.
Mr. Lewansky?<eos> Hello?<eos> What do you want?<eos> Sorry.<eos> I saw you at the window, so I thought...
I can handle a mountain master.<eos> Didn't say you couldn't.<eos> I've been expecting this since we first started dating.<eos> Never pictured myself living in a place like this when I got the news, though.<eos> Ken called you this morning at 3:00 A.M. Why?
That's terrible.<eos> I didn't do it.<eos> No, I know. The nurses have confirmed that you haven't left the hospital since Saturday morning.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But, uh, you called Ken, and then two hours later, an ambulance picked you up.
‚ô¨ In this place that I locked myself ‚ô¨ ‚ô¨ I walk through the darkness because ‚ô¨<eos> That, can you not do it?<eos> ‚ô¨ Iwantto findyou ,‚ô¨<eos> Oh Ri Jin, even without remembering what happened in your past, you're living very well in the present. ‚ô¨ I can't touch you or be embraced by you ‚ô¨<eos> There are a lot of people who love you as well, ‚ô¨ The things that are taking over me aren't the bastards living inside me ‚ô¨
The only way that I knew how...<eos> By becoming Emily Thorne.<eos> So from the time that you took on a new name and a new identity, you knew that you would have to deceive everyone.<eos> Yes.<eos> What did those lies do to the people who cared about you?
I'm sitting on the bench outside the M.E.'s office, and I'm listening to him tell me how this went down.<eos> And he's talking to me, and he's looking at me, and he's looking me right in the eye, and I'm going for it, until my wife shows up.<eos> And I get up and step back, and I watched him handle my wife.<eos> And that little voice popped into my head saying,<eos> "This guy is playing you."
Miss Whelan?<eos> I'm here for my brother, on his big day.<eos> As am I, Miss Whelan.<eos> As are we all.<eos> I would never do anything to hurt you.
You're in danger.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> From what?<eos> I can't go into the nature of the threat, but we will be guarding you and your children 24-7, here and wherever you go.<eos> You said I'd never see you again.
- Welcome, Minister Rahimi.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> It's very nice to meet you.<eos> A pleasure, Madam Secretary.<eos> I know my predecessor, Minister Javani, held you in high regard.
You told her at the party?<eos> No, the day before.<eos> And how did she react?<eos> She warned me that if I told anyone else about Eric, then he would find out, and he would destroy me.<eos> You told me before that Nika left you alone with Eric when he assaulted you.
I'll drop her off first.<eos> Uh... okay.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Thank you.<eos> The cab driver says that your boyfriend helped you into your building.
Make sure you Instagram that.<eos> You're late.<eos> And you're miserable.<eos> Go away.<eos> The Queen wishes me to accompany you on your charity tour.
Two of those visits you undertook on your own.<eos> Is that common practice for a female NYPD detective?<eos> He was more open to me that way.<eos> So he confided in you.<eos> Did he also enlist you to help him get a conjugal visit with Ms. Frain?
You know, I can tell that she's upset, but she doesn't want to talk about it.<eos> The last time that we went to visit him in the hospital and she could see he was getting better, he hugged her.<eos> I don't think I'd seen her cry since she was ten.<eos> Well, he's only been gone a few hours, and we are using all of our resources to find him.<eos> Absolutely, and please, if he contacts you, let us know.
After all, you're the genius behind the "deadman" game.<eos> Got to admit...<eos> Not what I expected.<eos> If I hear one more "Wizard of Oz" joke...<eos> Is that what Sean Ramsey said the first time he saw you?
But I've spoken to others in the community, and they've all said that if anyone's going to protect a survivor, it's you.<eos> I will.<eos> And I promise you that I will look after her.<eos> Heather was clear about wanting me to sit in with her.<eos> She doesn't know you, but she trusts me.
The curious are often drawn here, for a glimpse of Summerland.<eos> What's Summerland?<eos> Good question.<eos> It means the astral plain.<eos> Let us see who may be waiting for you there.
Would you state your name for the jury, please?<eos> Florence Brown.<eos> Do you go by any other names?<eos> People call me Cokey Flo.<eos> Why do they call you that?
You will never find us.<eos> But victim or perpetrator, if your number's up, we'll find you.<eos> We are only numbers to it.<eos> No. The Machine cares about us.<eos> The second that a bullet enters your brain, the Machine will cast you off and replace you.
Thank you.<eos> This look familiar, Miss Baines?<eos> This is Sebastian Berger, his satellite scanner picked up the call that lead to your rescue last night.<eos> Thank you, Mr. Berger, and yes, it does look familiar.<eos> We searched your house and the person who abducted you was there already.
Are you blackmailing me, Inspector Strand?<eos> This unit needs you, Inspector Costante.<eos> And you need it.<eos> More than you realize.<eos> I see why Dorn picked you to lead the team.
Did they find anything that you think might help us figure out why she was murdered?<eos> No.<eos> By all accounts, she was a great kid.<eos> I'm happy to put you in touch with the private investigator who found her.<eos> Yeah, thank you.
And, quite honestly, the most impossible.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I got that impression.<eos> Are you here for a reason?<eos> I needed to know you weren't upset by Mulder putting you on the spot with this Sveta business.
Do you know why me?<eos> Well, this is where our research is, um... Divisive.<eos> I would like very much to discuss this in person.<eos> Please just tell me.<eos> Miss durst, we believe that the demon Azrael has chosen you as his earthbound instrument.
No.<eos> My wife left me.<eos> Joined up.<eos> That must have been painful. Mm-hmm.<eos> No more painful than when Neil left you.
- Well...<eos> - I know you can't say anything.<eos> But I'm so thankful to you for trying.<eos> Is something the matter, m'lady?<eos> - I hope she wasn't bothering you.
- Don't we all?<eos> You seem unusually disenchanted with life these days, Mr Barrow.<eos> I can't see the future, Mr Carson.<eos> But then, I suppose, none of us can.<eos> Don't let it upset you.
- Thank you.<eos> I'm so happy for you.<eos> I'm sorry if I made things awkward about the reception.<eos> Please forgive me.<eos> Oh, m'lady, Mr Carson would forgive you if you attacked him with a brick!
So, the hacking device was for Tilden?<eos> - I can't comment on that.<eos> - I'm not withdrawing.<eos> I understand your position, Mrs. Florrick, but your sacrifice will not go unnoticed.<eos> The party will make it up to you in the next round.
Well, if the gaming commission doesn't interest you, take some time to think of a post that would better suit you.<eos> And if I don't withdraw, what happens then?<eos> You don't want to do that.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Because the party will destroy you.
- Mrs. Florrick, I assure you, this isn't personal.<eos> Like hell it isn't.<eos> Your problem can be summed up in three words: two-thirds majority.<eos> Be a good Democrat, step down now.<eos> The party'll take care of you.
No, no, no.<eos> It's not about the Bates'.<eos> They're off the hook.<eos> Then what's Miss Baxter done if it's not to do with them?<eos> Would you rather I questioned you alone, Miss Baxter?
I'll keep you informed at every step.<eos> What changed your mind?<eos> The thought of the girls he ruined.<eos> Like he ruined me.<eos> Oh, but he hasn't ruined you, has he?
Isn't that why you're here?<eos> What wonderful news.<eos> Daisy.<eos> Wonderful.<eos> She's going downstairs now, m'lady, and I'll see you in your room.
The line is blurring, Dr. Tyler, between this side and the next.<eos> How do I make it stop?<eos> I wish I knew.<eos> You think I have all the answers, but... I'm just like you.<eos> All I know is your N.D.E. changed you, just like mine changed me.
Does that sound like a good idea?<eos> I'm not gonna do anything.<eos> Go ahead, I... I'll just be with you in a moment.<eos> Lady Lola.<eos> I thought I recognized you, but I assumed I was mistaken.
So, boss.<eos> Are you going to do the whole "sick husband" routine, then?<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> I thought all female ATOs did this?<eos> Well, you know how the ANA don't think that women should work, but you say your husband's sick and he ordered you to get a job, and then, for some mental reason, they respect you.
~ Is it?<eos> ~ Yes. ~ Then I do!<eos> I really do!<eos> I...<eos> I think I love you, Captain Best!
"We cannot always build the future for our youth.."" "...but we can build our youth for the future."<eos> FDR's words were never more urgent.<eos> Gibbs, you all right?<eos> Forward march.<eos> We weren't expecting you until tomorrow.
Stop coddling the boy.<eos> Press him. What are you waiting for?<eos> Can we go back to your house now?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> He's playing you, Gibbs, and you're letting him.
- Yes, but surely...<eos> - For a lady's maid to insult a physician in the open street?<eos> You've read too many novels, Denker.<eos> - You've seen too many moving pictures.<eos> - I was sticking up for you.
Was this the man you were seeing behind your husband's back?<eos> The man you showed me earlier?<eos> No. I told you.<eos> I don't know him.<eos> Then why did he call you from his disposable cellphone last Thursday at 10:42 A.M.?
Let's call him and ask.<eos> Then again, I'm old-fashioned when it comes to the sanctity of marriage.<eos> Your husband, on the other hand, holds a more progressive view.<eos> Where's Frank?<eos> He lied to you, medicated you with barbiturates after philandering with a woman half his age and half your intelligence, and yet you persist in agitating for his return.
He didn't see anything.<eos> We don't want any trouble from the army, from anyone.<eos> They're gonna hurt him.<eos> Who?<eos> Did someone threaten you?
- Susie's told me everything you've done.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> - Oh, well...<eos> This is Ros Mahendra, my colleague.<eos> Oh, yes, I've seen you a couple of times.
No.<eos> So he just figured this all out on his own?<eos> Yo no Se. I don't know.<eos> You want me to say in another language?<eos> Javier must have put you up to this.
Your students mattered more<eos> You did nothing!<eos> I thought it was just fever.<eos> I messed up<eos> But I never neglected you, did I?
~ Who are you?<eos> ~ It's Pythagoras.<eos> I need your help.<eos> Aeson...<eos> I trust this news pleases you.
Would you like that, to truly serve a mistress such as I?<eos> I can think of no greater pleasure.<eos> The quality one most seeks in a servant is loyalty.<eos> One cannot serve two masters, nor two mistresses.<eos> Uh, madame, I... I have been your servant alone since I first saw you outside the jail.
What happened next?<eos> His mobile rang, it was the man who took him.<eos> I... I... I...<eos> I just don't know how they got our... our number.<eos> Well, portable scanner, they'd probably been following you
No.<eos> To clean his apartment.<eos> I remind you that you are under oath.<eos> Let me ask again, Miss Morenas.<eos> When you first met the defendant, was he a sex trafficker who beat and raped you?
I remind you that you are under oath.<eos> Let me ask again, Miss Morenas.<eos> When you first met the defendant, was he a sex trafficker who beat and raped you?<eos> No, he wasn't.<eos> You testified to a grand jury that Mr. Drake beat you and raped you.
My pimp, Timmer, found out that I was trying to escape, so he sold me to Johnny D.<eos> Sold you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> He said that after a few weeks with Johnny, I'd crawl back to him.<eos> What happened when he first brought you to Mr. Drake?
No, they don't ask for a meet to discuss exam results.<eos> They notify you by mail.<eos> So w-what's going on?<eos> I don't know, and none of my sources are talking.<eos> But they want you there at 7:30.
In the eyes of the public, S.H.I.E.L.D. no longer exists.<eos> And you were killed long before the agency you worked for was pronounced dead.<eos> Yet somehow, you both rise from the ashes.<eos> If I wasn't so intrigued, I'd be terrified.<eos> I got a feeling nothing scares you.
No, you don't understand.<eos> That siren means you don't have a choice. No.<eos> There are too many people.<eos> If anything happened, I'd never get out.<eos> Hold my hand and I promise I will lead you to safety.
That's the man that attacked me. Dr Cortner to labor and delivery. Medical tech supervisor to ICU.<eos> Uh, is he gonna survive, sheriff? Doctor's saying he'll be lucky to make it through the night.<eos> Quite the coincidence, huh?<eos> What is?<eos> Few days after that man attacks you, he's rolled in here half dead.
You wanna know how much a room costs in this "crappy hotel"?<eos> 400 bucks is the cheapest you can get...<eos> Okay! All right!<eos> Crappy hotel!<eos> - Now, did he hit you, lady? - What?
Second, he may be mentally ill and derives a certain aesthetic pleasure from those immoralities.<eos> This can be medically verified.<eos> But none of this attenuates the theft of the furniture.<eos> The landlord is coarse, you have no scruples, and your son is very stupid.<eos> Tell me, in what way does your son's stupidity materialize and how has that incurred you in debt?
You can stop now, Agent Parrish.<eos> We know it's you.<eos> That's ridiculous.<eos> If you were on perimeter detail, you'd be blocks away, not 100 yards from the blast.<eos> There's not a scratch on you, which is impossible, unless you placed yourself where we found you after the explosion, which I believe that you did.
All right, we're back in purely hypothetical territory here.<eos> I will let my client speak, but you can't use any of what she says in this second statement of facts until we have a plea agreement.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Are you admitting that Tate Harrison raped you and that he is the biological father of your son and that is why you killed him?
- with a view of the towers.<eos> - I'm sorry, sir, the first available slot I have is Christmas Day in four years' time.<eos> Not a problem.<eos> - Professor Song!<eos> The Doctor is waiting for you on the balcony. - Oh.
Not at all.<eos> Sir Gaveston.<eos> Baroness.<eos> Your devotion serves you.<eos> Our Savior blesses you in so many ways.
- How are you so sure?<eos> I know you.<eos> You're that agent whose son...<eos> Mrs. Parrish, your daughter has the weight of the FBI pushing down on her.<eos> If she loses you, what will she have left?
Well, I wander around here at all hours.<eos> Perhaps it's me they're hearing.<eos> The grandson you mentioned. Does he live nearby?<eos> Do you have any other family close?<eos> To keep an eye on you, if you need it?
From American Artistic Handcrafts?<eos> Yes?<eos> Yes. Uh, how are you?<eos> I'm fine, thank you.<eos> Um, you had asked me to advise you of any new pieces that might be of interest, and I've come across one or two things, so when do you think you might be able to visit the shop?
And I warn you I will not die as the result of gaijin stupidity.<eos> And don't underestimate me, either, you fucking Nip-loving prick!<eos> I talk, and we both die, and believe me, you've got a lot more to lose than me right now.<eos> We seem to have no choice but to trust each other, Mr. Frink.<eos> Miss Crain, I won't keep you long.
That's what the white race needs... badasses.<eos> But I'm not a degenerate.<eos> Chandler Ryan was a race traitor. Did you know that?<eos> He was working immigration, trying to fill the great state of California with people like you.<eos> Sorry to interrupt, Captain, but, uh, Chief Taylor would like to see you in his office - right now.
Returned Soldiers' Refuge.<eos> Well, why don't you come and have a look?<eos> Does he want something else?<eos> Did you want something else?<eos> Shall I put you on the roster?
I'd be most interested.<eos> Well, if you're not doing anything this evening, perhaps we might have dinner.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> But thank you for the invitation.<eos> If Prudence Swanson could have seen you with those men...
The bandits will be back!<eos> Drive!<eos> Hang on!<eos> Thanks for that.<eos> De nada. I owed you.
- Yes.<eos> And after you helped him feel good about taking risks, did he reveal that he then lost $50 million on one trade?<eos> Dr. Agard, you are under oath.<eos> And if you will not answer,<eos> I will have a judge compel you to answer.
Have you ever been pressured to do something you didn't want to do by a client before?<eos> Let me rephrase.<eos> Isn't it true that you released a client that you cared about from rehab for no reason other than you felt pressure from a different client who was actually paying the bills?<eos> Dr. Agard, you're under oath, and if you will not answer,<eos> I will have a judge compel you to answer.
The press caught me in the rotunda.<eos> But I wanted to say how honored I am to be here, and I will work hard.<eos> Where were you on the agenda... equal pay?<eos> Reproductive rights?<eos> That's not why we asked you here. Oh. Then why are we meeting?
That explains a lot.<eos> Well, her husband bullied a woman at work.<eos> Probably did it at home, too.<eos> Who will sort through all of your health records.<eos> Or should we assume your late husband took you to different doctors and didn't submit the charges to his insurance company so no one would know how often he was assaulting you?
I don't know. Why don't you draw me another diagram?<eos> You know, if you do want to rough her up a bit,<eos> - she can take it.<eos> - Shut up, Marsden.<eos> You want me to detain you for interfering with my operation?
- Correct. - All right.<eos> Drop the shoulder of your gown, step up to the yellow line.<eos> Arm up.<eos> It must be some pretty nasty stuff, huh? Looking at these images all day, probably got a pretty good eye, at this point, for anything concerning, right?<eos> Yeah. The doctor will call you with your results.
No.<eos> She wouldn't.<eos> Not Kate.<eos> What about this man?<eos> Has he contacted you lately?
No name's given, but it does sound like her.<eos> Well, read on, Lieutenant.<eos> "I entered the camp to find it gripped by a pall of fear and paranoia."<eos> Miss Dixon?<eos> Your reputation precedes you.
Bar attorneys stick together, Mrs. Florrick.<eos> We cover for each other.<eos> - What time do you need me?<eos> - 1:00 to 4:00.<eos> You'll be the only attorney, so I'll need you there.
- Of course I am, why would I...<eos> - Ma'am...<eos> There is no match to your prints.<eos> Or your DNA.<eos> And facial recognition did not find you in any of our databases.
- Who's coming here?<eos> Federal Police, the BND, Mossad?<eos> - No one.<eos> - No one?<eos> If no one's coming, then I'll kill you with my own hands.
I came to say hello to your colleagues on my way home.<eos> Is that so?<eos> The audition isn't over yet.<eos> Mrs. Lee?<eos> - I haven't seen you in a while.
We do have a favor we require. Aah!<eos> Don't be such a baby, or I'll give you something to really cry about.<eos> You mistake me, milady.<eos> I cry out only in grief.<eos> I was so struck by your beauty when I saw you at the gala, and now, after this affront to my person, I'll be forced to pluck those lovely almond eyes from your perfectly shaped skull.
Of course.<eos> My apologies.<eos> I think I'll sit.<eos> Might I say what an honor and a privilege it is to meet Your Majesty.<eos> I've admired you since I was young.
Yeah.<eos> It worked.<eos> Very well done, doctor.<eos> Very well done.<eos> If you're ready to go home, I'll call them to come pick you up.
The DNI needs a Russian asset with access to General Doroshevich.<eos> It's a top priority now, especially with all this Ostrov business.<eos> Ivan and Dmitri are both in his chain of command.<eos> Maybe there's still a way to make it work with Dmitri.<eos> The president's expecting you,
- It looks like a man.<eos> But there's a mask on his face, if it's a man.<eos> He's... wearing white shirt and pants.<eos> He looks pretty dirty.<eos> Has this man threatened you at all?
you think he's been trying to set all this up on me?<eos> yes. we do.<eos> Jack.<eos> Yeah, Yeah.<eos> he must have been playing you for a long time, buddy, knowing he would need a fall guy eventually.
Now... you can cooperate with us, maybe you don't go to prison.<eos> Think of Katya.<eos> I don't know anything.<eos> Don't... lie to us!<eos> You think Dmitry loves you?
Make your point, Ms. Rothlo.<eos> You killed your husband on your own, didn't you, Ms. Keating?<eos> - No, I did not.<eos> - You did.<eos> Sam cheated on you with that girl, and it made you angry.
This way.<eos> Madam Secretary, this is Judith Fanning.<eos> Madam Secretary.<eos> Ms. Fanning.<eos> By now, you've realized I haven't called you in to do work.
Spoiled brats.<eos> Where do you want this luggage?<eos> Has anyone seen a pink hat box?<eos> Princess Courtney, I must take my leave.<eos> But I shall see you back here in two weeks.
Don't care!<eos> After all, a bet's a bet!<eos> And Camp Royalty has this in the bag!<eos> Of course, Lady Anne, I'd love to have dinner with you tonight.<eos> Or may I call you Anne?
I thought we were clicking.<eos> Okay...<eos> People who click don't spy on each other!<eos> I don't like being followed.<eos> If I were following you, Ms. Danvers, you would never know about it.
Now!<eos> That was some fall you took.<eos> Easy.<eos> You're at the DEO.<eos> Rescue team pulled you out of the ocean.
An anti-insurgent combat device.<eos> Project code named, rt.<eos> I need her help testing it for me.<eos> Lucy: She has no choice.<eos> We have an executive order forcing you to comply.
It would show people that you stand for something.<eos> That you care.<eos> You think I don't care?<eos> You just met me.<eos> And I think it's time for the world to meet you.
Mr. Kane, good luck.<eos> I feel confident you're gonna need it.<eos> How about the, um... the other thing?<eos> Ah. I have messages out of my contacts.<eos> Any information we find out about your wife, I'll tell you immediately.
I guess nothing in life is permanent.<eos> Tell that to the victim.<eos> Oh, hey.<eos> Captain Beckett.<eos> What brings you out into the field?
Never even raised my gun.<eos> I'm sorry that he died, but two of my comrades died, too, and nobody is talking about that.<eos> He pulled his gun first.<eos> We weren't looking for trouble, but that has never stopped a cop from shooting black folks on sight.<eos> The all-white jury that sentenced you only took 30 minutes to give you life in prison.
When your sex life features in a case, it is my business.<eos> - This is not your role.<eos> - You've got in a muddle.<eos> Anyway, end of discussion.<eos> Go back to your desk, until the inspectors call you.
Come and fetch the young lady.<eos> What about our deal?<eos> Not a very credible tale.<eos> I got your file, from Bordeaux.<eos> The Inspectorate are waiting for you.
If I don't bring it back, I-I don't know what they'll do.<eos> Look, whatever it is you're looking for, maybe if you tell us what it is, we can help you out.<eos> I-I can't.<eos> They'll hurt me if I tell you.<eos> Who's gonna hurt you?
What are you doing?<eos> The party will be next to pike place if you change your mind.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no! Oh, my God.<eos> If I had any new information about your wife, don't you think I would've told you by now?
I see everything.<eos> I know what's coming for me.<eos> So are you the hawk, or are you the king?<eos> I'm the sword.<eos> If I had any new information about your wife, don't you think I would tell you?
I mean, I have the fashion sense of a street urchin, but even I can tell that those were made by a master.<eos> I mean, those are beautiful heels.<eos> I couldn't believe Mark got them for me.<eos> I'd been dreaming about a pair like this for months.<eos> He knew you pretty well.
She's able to come and go.<eos> She has access to one of the church's cars.<eos> I asked her to help me escape, and she said she would, but then...<eos> She double-crossed you.<eos> You hit her, and now they're suing you.
I'm late for work.<eos> It's in the sleeve of my black moto jacket.<eos> - Did you borrow it?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I didn't ask you 'cause I thought that would make things weird.
So what you gonna order?<eos> You?<eos> Good evening.<eos> Five-O.<eos> Sorry to bother you, ma'am, but we're doing a routine sweep of the area, looking for any signs of suspicious activity.
Possible.<eos> We're still running tests to match the hormones and the neurotoxin found in Lieutenant Garrett's system.<eos> Feels like you're grasping here.<eos> The facts speak for themselves. The plane was clean.<eos> Madam Secretary, if you don't mind, I'll catch up with you in a few minutes.
Just a few more signatures, and we'll be finished.<eos> Initial here to acknowledge that you've returned your key.<eos> Okay.<eos> As my future neighbor, I'd like you to have a key.<eos> Initial here to acknowledge you received it. I'm proud of you.
These aren't exactly threats.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> "Go to hell, bitch."?<eos> "Crybaby feminists "should be run off campus."?<eos> It's rude, yeah, but the First Amendment doesn't protect you from hurt feelings.
That was a mistake, calling and turning down the spot.<eos> I do want to go, and-and even though the timing is tricky, I was just thinking about what I want for my son.<eos> Just to reiterate, I can do this.<eos> I mean, it's a juggling act, but...<eos> I actually looked you up, and I saw that you have kids, so you understand...
Mrs. Juliano, I'm Detective Reagan.<eos> I was assigned to your daughter Ashley's case.<eos> I don't have any news yet.<eos> But she could still be alive?<eos> Did Ashley tell you where she was going before she went missing?
That flinch was just a little too calculated.<eos> So what if I know about my husband's affair?<eos> In my experience, it takes a master of control to put a cheating spouse in its own little box.<eos> You have no idea how I deal.<eos> You don't let weakness around you sap your strength.
Hey.<eos> Hey. How you doing?<eos> I'm, uh, good.<eos> Um, you know, if... if you just wait by the elevators,<eos> Ryan and Espo will take you home.
I'm, uh, good.<eos> Um, you know, if... if you just wait by the elevators,<eos> Ryan and Espo will take you home.<eos> I'd rather French kiss a corpse.<eos> A uniform will drive you.
I'm so bad with numbers.<eos> About 17 to 18 times.<eos> Let's do 17 installments.<eos> Whenever you stop in is fine.<eos> We won't come chasing after you every time you pass by the store.
It looked exactly the same.<eos> Brings back memories.<eos> I wonder how everyone's doing.<eos> I'm sure they're doing well.<eos> They've all turned into old hags, and they're cheerfully cursing you.
Mayu said she'll continue working as before...<eos> But I'm sure it came as a shock to have what you made be completely rejected.<eos> I'm sure the boss feels the same way.<eos> Welcome.<eos> We've been expecting you, Ms. Nagai.
I'm gonna press charges against Lane for sexual assault.<eos> Why are you telling me this?<eos> Because you're with him now.<eos> And I wanted you to know ahead of time.<eos> 'Cause you're hoping I'll back you up and make it two against one.
Anyone who might have had a grudge? Um... He had a...<eos> A client.<eos> Uh, years ago when he was an attorney, who sued him for malpractice.<eos> We're going to need his name and contact info if you could track it down.<eos> I'll have an officer take you home.
If Matthew hadn't interfered, so many criminals might have gone free.<eos> That's true. Who knows how many lives he saved?<eos> That's something, right?<eos> It really is.<eos> Let me walk you out.
- You have no manners. - I have no hypocrisy.<eos> Pretending to be evil is also evil.<eos> The fact that I'm the only one who can save your sister... Don't forget that.<eos> You're right.<eos> But... for you as well... don't forget the fact that I'm the only boat that will take you to the outside world.
Please spare my mother.<eos> Have mercy.<eos> Have you been looking after me?<eos> If the arrow had pierced a little more deeply, your life would be in danger.<eos> But I had doctors treat you so you should be fine.
Excuse me.<eos> I'm... here for an ID parade.<eos> I'm a witness.<eos> I just wondered if you knew how long it's going to be?<eos> I'm not sure, but someone from CID will come and get you soon as they're ready, OK?
And Frank?<eos> Frank's new to the group over these last few months.<eos> He's sweet. But clearly struggling, so we would meet here early and just talk, I swear.<eos> Let me guess.<eos> He sought you out?
I'm helping her to come to terms with her feelings.<eos> Don't claim to be doing good because I know you're not.<eos> Good and bad being your expertise, of course.<eos> Your calling making you feel extra special in the world.<eos> No wonder your husband called you an... What was it he called you?
Ms. keating, I've lost my patience.<eos> It's not about patience but of a young woman's life.<eos> Enough of this.<eos> Miss Hapstall, please stand.<eos> Do you understand that you're pleading guilty to count one of the information, which charges you with first-degree murder in the death of grant Hapstall?
Miss Hapstall, please stand.<eos> Do you understand that you're pleading guilty to count one of the information, which charges you with first-degree murder in the death of grant Hapstall?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - I'm so sorry.<eos> And count two, which charges you with first-degree murder in the death of Ursula Hapstall?
Previously on "The Player"...<eos> If I had any new information about your wife, don't you think I would tell you?
Please sign these papers to confirm you join the mission voluntarily and understand all the risks involved.<eos> Our mission is to find your boyfriend and his grandma.<eos> If you get lost in the mountains, here's a whistle.<eos> Blow the whistle at once and hang the red strips on the trees.<eos> Then we'll find you.
Who is this?<eos> Your husband.<eos> - My husband?<eos> - Yes.<eos> He loves you, and he's gonna take you home.
ECMO acts as a heart-lung bypass, oxygenating the infant's blood outside its body.<eos> - Sats are rising.<eos> - Thank God.<eos> Dr. Manning?<eos> There's a Kara Dougherty downstairs to see you.
You know why we're looking for your son, ma'am?<eos> Cops say he killed some girls.<eos> Five girls.<eos> That we know of.<eos> Why don't I help you with that?
Yeah, he, uh... hit them with a hammer, strangled them and desecrated their bodies.<eos> That boy was always messing with dead things.<eos> How's that?<eos> He used to capture little animals, and he'd chop off their heads, or, you know, stab 'em to death. and then he'd put 'em outside the house on sticks, sort of like lawn ornaments.<eos> And that, uh, never raised any red flags with you, huh?
He did?<eos> He told me he was on the front page of the paper.<eos> He was real proud of that.<eos> I bet he was.<eos> When did he call you?
Keithforthe win . Takeowinsimmunity, jeff:<eos> Keithforthe win . yes! yes!<eos> Takeowinsimmunity, sending bayon to tribal council.<eos> Goodjob,guys. Angkor, congratulations.<eos> Plus applause woo, you don't even want to wait Woo, you don't even want to wait for me to come to you.
Shaken.<eos> Dirty and wet.<eos> Has to be just right, huh?<eos> I know what I like.<eos> Haven't seen you around here before.
It's a lot to buy.<eos> Agent Cook, I'll tell you what.<eos> Get behind my investigation.<eos> And when I'm back in D.C. tomorrow, I won't remind them that it took me to figure out what was under your nose all along.<eos> Not saying I don't believe you.
They have no opinions.<eos> You won't even know I'm here.<eos> Barba, you brought backup?<eos> Lisa Hassler.<eos> What noble cause brings you to court?
And I put him under the concrete slab.<eos> Were you present when the defendant made that statement?<eos> Yes.<eos> It was voluntary, and he had been informed of his rights.<eos> What led you to suspect the defendant in the first place?
What has happened to our car?<eos> Smashed badly during accident.<eos> Totally garbage.<eos> Still at the scene of accident.<eos> So, let me arrange a car, to take you to city.
Ask Angela for help once she gets back from the FBI.<eos> If she scans in your data, she might be able to use a program that could help discern possible patterns.<eos> That's a great idea.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Dr. Saroyan, I didn't mean to, but I heard you outside the bone room earlier with that man. Oh.
Don't stand shoulder-width apart with my shoulders as reference... use yours.<eos> Well, it doesn't seem that different though.<eos> Was yesterday just a dream?<eos> He kissed me, so what's with this intense training?<eos> Just because I pressed you against the wall you're not thinking about something erotic, are you?
Yes, but sometimes it's something.<eos> I'm good.<eos> I may need more of this.<eos> Call me.<eos> You said that Dr. Fisher tricked you into donating tissue, but isn't that your signature there on the release form?
Great.<eos> Before your testimony here.<eos> - Objection, Your Honor.<eos> - Overruled.<eos> You said that Dr. Fisher tricked you into donating tissue.
Which I want right now.<eos> This is me and your mom in Macau around '89.<eos> She shot me, like, two weeks later.<eos> She probably taught you English, right?<eos> Thought she was doing you a favor until they recruited you when you were a little kid.
"I just need to get her alone.<eos> "Once I stick her with the sedative, "it's seconds till she twilights, then I'll take her limp body..."<eos> I can't read this.<eos> That post is from October 23.<eos> The next day, October 24, did the defendant call you?
They're a necessary release.<eos> I know you're a therapist...<eos> I'm a clinical psychiatrist.<eos> Right.<eos> But we're calling you as a wife.
Why did Kwon Jae Hee kidnap Lieutenant Yeom?<eos> Lieutenant was wearing the same clothes as you.<eos> But you really are wearing the same clothes as Oh Cho Rim!<eos> You never know.<eos> So you're thinking that Kwon Jae Hee won't recognize you... if you're wearing the same clothes and similar hairstyle as Cho Rim?
Very dark. Yeah.<eos> I mean, what kind of person do you think I am?<eos> I love my husband and my children, and I certainly don't deserve to have... What is it... The Miranda warning or whatever thrust at me twice in the same day with my whole family missing!<eos> It's outrageous!<eos> Oh, I'm so sorry if we've offended you.
Yes, a very long time.<eos> Comrade, can you tune it?<eos> No problem.<eos> Aren't you feeling well?<eos> Is there anyone to take care of you?
He went to prison.<eos> Do you recognize this man?<eos> Why?<eos> Who is he?<eos> His name is Bobby Cordero, I think he's the man who attacked you in the park that night.
What are you doing, Ms. Rose?<eos> Cutting watermelon, Beckett.<eos> I love watermelon.<eos> You shouldn't show up uninvited.<eos> Do you even know what to do if a man comes at you with a knife?
I'm sorry.<eos> You know it.<eos> You know it's about a bed.<eos> He's not well enough to leave.<eos> I'm sorry. What qualifies you to make that prognosis?
Well, enjoy your last night in the Cairngorms.<eos> I'm sure you will.<eos> Cheers.<eos> How do you know it's our last night?<eos> Because when I first met you, you told me you were staying for the weekend.
I hope you had a good time playing me.<eos> I hope it's enough to get you through what's coming.<eos> And I wanted to ask you... what were you planning on doing with all the drugs you got stored away up in that mine?<eos> Someone called in an anonymous tip.<eos> They're cleaning you out, right now.
Rapido, rapido, come on, chop chop.<eos> Maybe we don't have to.<eos> I really shouldn't be here.<eos> If Mr. Mortimer finds out, I could be fired.<eos> I understand, that we've put you in a uncomfortable position, by asking you here, but we really do appreciate your help.
We'll need to transfer Mrs Adams<eos> The labour ward is overflowing, I'm afraid.<eos> That social worker in there is a disgrace.<eos> Well, I know she likes a drink, but disgrace is a little harsh.<eos> Mrs Thomas, we'll have you into a cubicle as soon as possible.
Just wish us luck, princess.<eos> You're going home, remember?<eos> Wait here.<eos> I'll be back for you shortly.<eos> Sister Millar, I said we'd call you when we're ready.
Sounds like a plan.<eos> Hi.<eos> Whoa. Oh, my God.<eos> How did you strike out again?<eos> I set you up perfectly.
I am sorry.<eos> You are absolutely right. I did not mean to sound curt.<eos> And you are right. This is important.<eos> So, you and I should go through your proposal and discuss it right down to the last detail.<eos> I'm not asking you to go through it page by page. Just to help me initiate some meaningful dialogue.
I'll get you a car.<eos> Erm... what my wife said about those men... we experimented on. That's... That's not true, is it?<eos> I can't talk about that, sir.<eos> And neither can you.<eos> I'll get someone to take you to the hospital.
I have to say you're altogether rather impressive, Miss...<eos> Lancaster.<eos> Alice Lancaster.<eos> Do I know you from somewhere?<eos> I could swear I've seen you before.
No firearms?<eos> No backup?<eos> If there was anything I could do to reverse that decision, sir...<eos> DI Denton's statement records she was acting on DS Akers' instructions.<eos> Nobody's blaming you, I mean if those were Akers' instructions.
Police.<eos> Police. Where are you?<eos> Are you OK?<eos> Don't be frightened.<eos> Please come out where we can see you.
Kate, will you do that, anyway?<eos> Yes, sir. Mm-hm.<eos> We'll also need your clothes for forensics.<eos> Nothing personal, you understand, it's procedure.<eos> We'll have a doctor look at you, and in the meantime, we'll take care of you.
This is the breakthrough we've been desperate for.<eos> If you'll excuse us, Ted?<eos> Sir.<eos> Sorry to keep you.<eos> Dr Kaur will see you now, and then the burns specialist will come and have a look at your hands.
No.<eos> No problem.<eos> Think I must have the wrong person.<eos> You have a good day, Inspector.<eos> Sorry to disturb you at home, ma'am. Can I come in, please?
You even mentioned them straight after you found out she was dead.<eos> Strange it'd be the first thing you'd think of.<eos> Open the overnight bag.<eos> Unzip the compartment.<eos> Lindsay Denton, we're hereby returning you to custody.
First, we kill.<eos> Then, we pluck.<eos> I shall be your eyes and ears.<eos> Well, I'm most grateful.<eos> Norman will drive you back to town.
(DOOR RATTLES) I'm coming!<eos> It's urgent, Doctor.<eos> AMO: Miss Carolyn!<eos> Sorry to drop in unannounced.<eos> So many years, we no see you.
So?<eos> What's it gonna be, Joe?<eos> Answer honestly.<eos> This is for legal record.<eos> False answers put you at risk of perjury, you understand?
I don't want war. No blood, no police after me.<eos> But everyone should appreciate my son Gennys work in Honduras.<eos> We can offer excellent quality at low prices And consignments come regularly and safely.<eos> All this thanks to my son, Genny.<eos> If you want, we can sell to you at an attractive price to everyone.
Too many memories.<eos> If you've got time, I could show you something.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I was clearing out some drawers... and I came across... this.<eos> Stuart said not to bother you with it.
He's been frozen like that for days.<eos> ‚ô™ Girls<eos> ‚ô™ All I really want is girls<eos> ‚ô™ And in the morning it's girls... ‚ô™<eos> Wow. Now I see why they call you Miss Hoover.
We have our ways.<eos> Well, what other ways besides guns and money?<eos> We have two ways.<eos> Two very good ways. ‚ô™ Samba! Red card!<eos> Let me give that back to you.
You used the word "intertwined."<eos> That's the sense I'm getting from all of this.<eos> The samarium subsidy, the Chinese refinery, the bridge,<eos> - your friendship with the president...<eos> - Who sent you?
And so what if she moved to L.A. to reinvent herself?<eos> She's allowed.<eos> She's not allowed to be ashamed of me.<eos> She's not allowed to forget what I did for her, how I put clothes on her back a-and a roof over her head.<eos> I'm not sure what she remembers about her childhood, but I'm sure she loves you.
And at least we got the service moved back to 4pm so that Sister Julienne can get here.<eos> Bowls - kidney - six.<eos> Clamps - midwives - for the use of - six.<eos> Sister Evangelina, you're wanted at the door.<eos> May God bless you on your jubilee, my dear Sister. Oh!
Hello, Francoise.<eos> Hello.<eos> News from Gabriel?<eos> Yes, I called earlier.<eos> He recalled not you?
We argued.<eos> He went back upstairs.<eos> I went to the bathroom to fix my face.<eos> When I came upstairs, he was giving that stupid speech.<eos> Did anyone see you?
He's here.<eos> You're Rachael?<eos> You've got the wrong room.<eos> I'm a friend of Pastor Tom's.<eos> He sent you?
I've just lost the only man that I've ever been with.<eos> So...<eos> Maybe I cross my arms because I'm alone and... it reassures me.<eos> I know what kind of man your husband was, Nan.<eos> I know he controlled your body and how he controlled your finances and kept you on a very tight budget despite his success.
- Mrs. Yarrow, open the door.<eos> Dunn.<eos> A Ballard parent is on the damn news.<eos> I'm sending you a link right now.<eos> What did the caller ask you?
Uh, Dr. Lark.<eos> You haven't seen Leo down here, have you?<eos> - I can't find him anywhere.<eos> - N-no, I haven't.<eos> Oh, Dr. Black wants to see you upstairs.
Okay, I know what it feels like.<eos> Dr. Black to radiology stat.<eos> I know what it feels like to be told that you might not experience the one thing that gives you a thrill, that gives you pleasure and joy.<eos> I know that. You might not believe me, but it's true.<eos> Dr. Black, they need you downstairs in radiology stat.
Simon's ever laid eyes on him.<eos> Look, I know this is a big mess but please, don't judge the child by the family.<eos> And, you know, that is an official rule of the Little Prince Charming pageant.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> I do recognize you.
I did.<eos> Were you aware that George was already married at the time?<eos> Of course not.<eos> No further questions.<eos> Er, my client has treated you very shabbily, hasn't he?
Good enough shot to get a bullet in you before you put a blade in me.<eos> And for that, I am sincerely grateful.<eos> Been wondering about that night.<eos> How do you know where I live?<eos> I think a little birdie wanted me to kill you.
I know.<eos> The truth is, I don't know if you're ready.<eos> That being said, I don't know that keeping you here will provide... revelations.<eos> We won't know, will we... until you're back out there?<eos> Your friends have missed you dearly.
What is this "reason to believe"?<eos> Our information comes from a source who is extremely well-connected.<eos> I thought the death threats were supposed to come after you get elected.<eos> You're the presumed nominee, governor.<eos> The next primary win puts you over the top.
What can be done?<eos> Nothing in my power.<eos> But much that's in yours.<eos> Oh, how so?<eos> He venerates you.
You did nothing.<eos> And in a few seconds you're gonna be nothing.<eos> Nothing at all.<eos> Wow! Is that you?<eos> I didn't recognize you there.
And if I can be of any assistance...<eos> Oh, I think we're more than capable.<eos> Yes, I'm quite certain you are.<eos> It's just, sometimes it takes a con to catch one.<eos> - Then perhaps I'll call on you.
You should at least let me examine it before making false claims.<eos> I think you know precisely where the document is, as well as the whereabouts of Ian Worthington.<eos> I wish I did.<eos> We were to marry.<eos> I think he learned of your lies, and confronted you with the evidence.
And he's wearing a lounge suit.<eos> One last thing.<eos> Peter sent you satsumas.<eos> But if they don't meet with your approval, then you can pass them on to the baronet's widow.<eos> Sister Julienne says that if you eat a good lunch, she's happy for us to take care of you, and won't send for Doctor.
But surely they're both equally important?<eos> I've lost count of the number of babies I've delivered, Sister, and this would be something new for me.<eos> It's something I feel very inspired by.<eos> I can see that.<eos> But if I were to take you away from midwifery - possibly for weeks - the mothers and babies of the district would suffer.
I've delivered so many babies and I've never once not managed.<eos> Never once failed to do what I was trained for.<eos> If it was just tiredness, I'd know tomorrow would be better but...<eos> Please.<eos> Let me walk you back.
Though I have a car stereo probably costs more than you make, so that ain't sayin' much.<eos> That's a lot of money for a gun that probably doesn't shoot.<eos> The hell it doesn't.<eos> I've got a negro down in Alabama makes them load special for me.<eos> This doesn't bother you at all?
Yes, he shot me.<eos> I have the gun in here.<eos> Okay, just relax, ma'am.<eos> Nobody's trying to kill you.<eos> I promise I'm gonna have you out of there in just a second.
I'm the only one with access to the archives.<eos> It's about time to change that!<eos> Mr George is an old friend of my grandfather and the only person who I trust.<eos> Miss Gwendolyn, do not look at me like that.<eos> You know perfectly well that I was forbidden to help you.
I hear electrical is looking.<eos> You feel me?<eos> I ain't goin' nowhere.<eos> You feel me?<eos> Miss Diaz, we just need verbal confirmation... that Officer Mendez forced himself on you. - Can you provide that?
Without telling her specifics, he warned her he was involved in something he called simply "The Bad Thing".<eos> And I had sort of crazy theories, like, that he was having an affair with Elizabeth Warren or something.<eos> I speculated both Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Warren, actually, but...<eos> So, sometime in probably late July, Aaron called me, and I happened to pick up, and he said, "The Bad Thing" might be in the news tomorrow.<eos> Do you want me to tell you, or do you want to read about it in the news?"
My mother says I should go or else I'll be late for my shift.<eos> Keller Shirtwaist Factory on Delancey.<eos> Be sure she gets there safely, Jesse.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> I expected you over an hour ago. What kept you?
Except for the abortions and all.<eos> - I meant...<eos> - I know what you meant.<eos> And I know you ain't them.<eos> I don't know much, but I would wager that God will put you far ahead of Sister Clarice when it comes to passing through the pearly gates.
What do you mean?<eos> - No, I just...<eos> - What did you think?<eos> Nothing. Um...<eos> Mr. Barrow is looking for you.
I think he's never met me.<eos> Abed.<eos> Abed.<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> When this game is over, I'm gonna shove you back.
I cannae do it all on my own, Lee.<eos> Hello, baby.<eos> What's this?<eos> Hello, love.<eos> When I saw you at the cafe, I panicked.
Do you? Mm.<eos> So why don't you tell me what you know, and let me decide what to make font colo<eos> On the night of the benefit, I saw Ellie Connock on a slip road, and let's put it this way, she was not pointing in the direction of her home.<eos> Well, where was she heading?<eos> You know that place I took you out to the other day?
I assure you, governor Reston.<eos> You want to discuss decorum, Sally?<eos> Let's discuss your choice to split with my administration without having the decency to resign.<eos> Look, you're a hard worker, and you're smart.<eos> It's why I chose you to serve with me.
I can get information.<eos> Sir, she makes an excellent point.<eos> She has no field experience.<eos> I was just assigned to Zurich.<eos> With a man to keep watch over you.
White wine.<eos> Miss Andrews, please permit me to pay for that.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Philip Davis.<eos> I have been listening to you for weeks now.
All going back.<eos> All going back.<eos> And now it's changing and it's all going forward.<eos> And we're going up...<eos> I never thought I'd see you again.
[chuckles] - Hi!<eos> [sighs]<eos> Have fun, you guys!<eos> By-y-y-y-y-y-e!<eos> Bye! I will see you next Thursday! - Hillary:
We need more samples.<eos> It's all right, Rachel.<eos> We can come back tomorrow.<eos> Ma'am, we've been trying to reach you.<eos> CO wants you back on the ship.
Don't worry.<eos> She's in good hands.<eos> - Good, thank you.<eos> - You're welcome.<eos> - Ok. - Maybe we'll see you at the next Family Day?
That sounds exciting.<eos> If we get planning permission.<eos> We'll get planning permission.<eos> I heard you have been turned down once already.<eos> They turned you down?
Bitch.<eos> Traitor.<eos> That's what they call me, in my mail, online.<eos> I wish I had never called.<eos> I wish I had never met you.
I'm sorry.<eos> I'm afraid you have me mistaken for someone else.<eos> I'm not mistaken.<eos> I'm not mistaken!<eos> I've never seen you before.
It's the truth.<eos> Officer Kalakaua, you are on the record.<eos> Please remember that.<eos> Well, then let the record show that this is bull, because you have Chin Ho in the crosshairs, and you're gonna twist whatever I say to suit your agenda, so I don't even know why I'm wasting my time.<eos> Officer Kalakaua, let me remind you that your immunity and means doesn't effect this proceeding.

Hey!<eos> That's my drink.<eos> You'd better pay for it.<eos> Put it on my tab.<eos> How about I put you on your arse, huh?
Well, no one is.<eos> Too much TV.<eos> Okay, good chat.<eos> Glad you came.<eos> Victor loves you.
Just don't.<eos> And you are?<eos> His sister.<eos> The one you left behind when you stole him from his family.<eos> Dr. Walker, these men will escort you back to the lab.
Brr, dude.<eos> Do you have any idea what kind of women troll those sites?<eos> I'll let you know.<eos> Dr... oman... auma.<eos> I think they need you in trauma.
Not many people were nice to me... listened to what I say or, let alone, cared about it.<eos> Not even my own mom or dad.<eos> But you, you were a mother to me more than my own mom.<eos> Sometimes, uh, we don't get to say the things that we want to say until it's too late.<eos> And I wanted to say... I'm going to miss you.
I'm sure.<eos> How...<eos> Look in the envelope.<eos> There's more.<eos> Matt still loves you.
Yeah, I make beats.<eos> - Me and Maddie do that by clapping.<eos> - Stop.<eos> [Knock on door] Mr. Wheeler, time for your meet-n-greet.<eos> And Ms. Jaymes, Bucky asked that I bring you to your live-stream producer.
I pawned my silver medal for the medical care to give birth.<eos> Then I broke back into the same pawn shop and stole a watch.<eos> I stole to feed my newborn.<eos> I didn't know it was a front for criminals.<eos> And they tracked you down?
The same threat she holds over me. She's vicious enough to do it.<eos> Well, you did intimate if there was anything you could do...<eos> And I meant it.<eos> But I've since decided it's best George and I don't see each other.<eos> He will listen to you.
Well, you did intimate if there was anything you could do...<eos> And I meant it.<eos> But I've since decided it's best George and I don't see each other.<eos> He will listen to you.<eos> He still loves you deeply.
I came for the country air.<eos> Oh, it's a lot less fresh suddenly.<eos> What have you done?<eos> Saved George from becoming a bigamist.<eos> Mrs Bligh is asking for you, ma'am.
After the dust-up yesterday, I thought it would be best if we kept our patients away from each other, unless you're going for stitches next time, Doctor.<eos> I don't think this is the right solution.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Obstetrics.<eos> Uh, Mrs. Johnson, it seems someone's trying to track you down.
Look, forgetting Anton is not the answer here.<eos> Are you one of those anti-scrubbers or something?<eos> I don't agree with scrubbing.<eos> Well, maybe if your life depended on it, you would.<eos> You have more faith in the tech finding you than me stopping it.
They're threats.<eos> We found the videos in a safety-deposit box Anton had.<eos> Wh... what?<eos> Anton traded his software to protect you.<eos> They needed his expertise, and they used you to get it.
For now.<eos> Just you and me.<eos> Okay.<eos> How do I get the blood sample?<eos> Well, when the surgery is over, I'll have someone bring you into the operating room, and I'll hand it to you.
I've done some further reading, Dr. Sanders.<eos> The genetic marker for dementia that you claimed you found in my husband's blood.<eos> One lab in the country runs the test for that, and his blood wasn't sent there.<eos> Which means you've been lying.<eos> You have exactly one minute to explain yourself, before I open that door and have Secret Service arrest you.
Sandra.<eos> - Don't.<eos> - It's protocol.<eos> During a blackout, we're all supposed to exit through the front.<eos> Which is exactly what the man who called you will be waiting for.
I know about that little chat you had today with the FBI.<eos> So, I'm going to make this real simple for you.<eos> I'm warning you, do not talk to them again.<eos> I know where you live.<eos> This person calls you by name.
I thought her getting that job with that company, that security firm, it really was the best thing she could do.<eos> Nora. Ah, that girl, she was fearless.<eos> First one in, last one out.<eos> Hell, if half the boys on my crew had a pair like her, well, you could crown me king and take the afternoon off.<eos> She pressured you?
Hell, if half the boys on my crew had a pair like her, well, you could crown me king and take the afternoon off.<eos> She pressured you?<eos> How? She wanted me to use my position at work to try to get information on people at a competing security firm...<eos> Stuff that she could use to get the upper hand.<eos> And when you refused, she hit you?
So I need you to access the strategy file in Dropbox.<eos> Password, "mother_fucker."<eos> So our next move - is to stop Chung from running.<eos> - No.<eos> Two ex-military candidates are gonna squeeze you out, ma'am.
A little leeway?<eos> Proceed.<eos> Ms. Palmer, who is Dr. Peter Langley?<eos> He's a fertility specialist.<eos> Did Dr. Langley ever treat you?
- And the amnesiac?<eos> - He's no use, at the moment.<eos> We need results, Chatelet.<eos> If your colleagues were available, you wouldn't be on this case.<eos> Don't mess up, or the magistrates will have you.
And do the right thing for Lee Anne.<eos> Well done, counselor.<eos> You, too.<eos> As soon as the verdict is in, you and I will no longer be opposing counsel.<eos> Look, I'm sorry if you thought that I was playing you or...
Where?<eos> There -- that oak tree. Another friend of yours?<eos> Of course I heard about the murders at the Windall.<eos> What does any of that have to do with me?<eos> We're investigating the murders, and we have reason to believe that whoever hired that assassin has selected you as the next target.
Assault with a deadly weapon.<eos> My ex-boyfriend attacked me with a baseball bat.<eos> I tried to get away in my car, and ran over his foot.<eos> Now you see why I don't talk to cops.<eos> Did Colin Haynes attack you with a baseball bat?
Nothing more.<eos> Dumbbell?<eos> No.<eos> I think I'm done, thanks.<eos> How come I never see you up in the wardroom?
My house was firebombed, and that tape was leaked to the press.<eos> And your husband drove off the road and disappeared, right?<eos> Yes.<eos> Perhaps he didn't disappear.<eos> Perhaps, Ms. Marcus, he left you after discovering you have continued your affair with Officer McCandless.
I want you to meet my niece-- Detective Max Hardy, NYPD.<eos> This is FBI Director Tom Franklin.<eos> It's an honor, Director Franklin.<eos> Oh, it's good to see you're out of harm's way.<eos> I understand your uncle has kept you quite busy.
Very good.<eos> Does Margaux still have the herb garden?<eos> I think so.<eos> Ah. She has the most extensive collection Of fresh herbs in Paris,<eos> From this combination of herbs. Drink it every morning, And I'm hopeful this will put you back on the right track.
- Okay.<eos> I think we saw each other five to six months ago,<eos> Is that right?<eos> I'm due in a week.<eos> Right, well, I'm gonna check you Into a hospital right now then.
No, doctor, no hospital.<eos> My husband can't know where I'll be.<eos> Don't you understand?<eos> I do understand, Rosemary.<eos> However, if we book you into a hospital now, Then you'll be secure, And the baby can be delivered safely.
Now the gloves!<eos> How are we supposed to work?<eos> Calm down.<eos> Neither today nor tomorrow!<eos> - Then we're taking you.
You should've gotten the job, Michelle.<eos> Ah, everything happens for a reason.<eos> What's the history between you two?<eos> It's a long story.<eos> Fill you in later.
Lady up top is stuck.<eos> I need help! [Crying]<eos> - I can't move.<eos> - Okay.<eos> All right. We're gonna get you out of here, okay?
- I'm already here.<eos> Get out of my face.<eos> You fucking kidding me?<eos> You think I killed Anibal?<eos> You think I'd play you like that? Hmm? We had a conversation.
It's time to go.<eos> Jill!<eos> Jill!<eos> First he dies, and then I do.<eos> And remember, I am only doing this because all of you screwed up!
Okay.<eos> Flex your feet for me, please.<eos> Toes to the ceiling.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm gonna have Jackson take you up for a C.T.
It's the clothing that stitches it all together.<eos> That's what matters.<eos> - We're done here. - Glen!<eos> Glen!<eos> Oh. I'm sorry. I didn't see you there.
You've got a hell of a temper, Ms. King.<eos> It's not temper.<eos> It's frustration.<eos> Glen Carter, our new owner, cares more about money than fashion.<eos> Is that why you were paranoid he was gonna replace you?
Thank you.<eos> I'm just the guy who tracked the monster for 7 years.<eos> Someone had to.<eos> And I track the man behind the monster.<eos> Counselor, I haven't liked you much these past few days.
Um... ..oh, Bruce Beattie, I suppose.<eos> Douglas had to pull a rabbit out of a hat to get Graham re-elected.<eos> Bruce was furious.<eos> Is there anything else you need from me?<eos> No, we'll call you if there is.
I understand you were present when Bobby Lee died last night.<eos> Is this correct?<eos> Yes.<eos> Senior Constable Davis will take your statement.<eos> In the meantime, we'll hold you in the cells while we consider the charges levelled against you.
Yes.<eos> So, how come we found the knife in the alleyway.<eos> Well, you told me that's where you thought it happened.<eos> I thought putting the knife there might throw you.<eos> Peggy, your doctor described you as a lovely girl with a very active imagination.
Since my husband had to go interstate.<eos> Were you in love with Mr Lennox?<eos> No.<eos> We spoke to your neighbours, Mrs Wooton.<eos> Your husband hasn't gone interstate, he's left you.
Your brain's in one piece.<eos> And if you need any legwork doing, consider me at your disposal.<eos> -You? !<eos> -Why not me?<eos> Well, I've always put you down as decorative rather than useful.
And a very good day to you too!<eos> What are you doing up there Mrs. McCarthy?<eos> Wasn't my idea.<eos> Well, how could I sit up at front and leave the Holy Mother balancing here on the back?<eos> Let me help you down.
You OK?<eos> It's so sad, you know, reading about someone's dreams, how they see their future, knowing that most of it will never happen.<eos> I miss him.<eos> I know.<eos> Ah! Dwayne said I'd find you here.
Found it in the market.<eos> Do you know it?<eos> No...<eos> I don't know it.<eos> When you realised Richard Poole was on to you...
You want me to blow up the Yap Trench?<eos> No one else on the submarine, no one else on Palau, no one else at Woods Hole,<eos> Scripps or Jacque Cousteau's great-grandson knows as more about the Yap Trench as you do Ms. Knox.<eos> And no one knows how to operate that HROV.<eos> So I'm putting you in charge of the placement, timing, size and detonation of the nuclear charges.
You had a personal relationship with Lt. Skinner, from what I understand.<eos> Add that to the stress of this last case, and I can understand how his suicide must have been quite a blow.<eos> He didn't kill himself and you know it.<eos> You... put me in this chair.<eos> I would gladly lock you up for the rest of your fucking days.
Don't move!<eos> Put your fucking hands up!<eos> Get 'em up!<eos> What do you want?<eos> Who sent you?
I was a prostitute.<eos> It was a long time ago.<eos> You were young.<eos> You were really young.<eos> But then your husband came along and rescued you.
Yes, but I could have been in the laundry, or taking out the garbage.<eos> Vega: Well, I'm sure they've got you doing the cooking and the cleaning too?<eos> And you take care of the daughter?<eos> Yes.<eos> Hmm. Sounds like they keep you busy.
Anything else?<eos> Yes.<eos> Where were you between 8:30 and 8:35 yesterday evening?<eos> In my chambers.<eos> Anyone see you there?
And the last memory I have of Carlton.<eos> Is everything set for the auction?<eos> We're expecting quite a turnout.<eos> Inspector Goodman.<eos> Miss Foster, we have a witness who says they saw you at Carlton's villa last night.
If you cooperate, I will move to get your sentence reduced.<eos> This is the last time I'm going to say this.<eos> I will never betray him or my marriage again.<eos> You might want to reconsider that.<eos> He certainly betrays you every chance he gets.
- It's like it has an Asian mother.<eos> - Hmm.<eos> - What... - What is this?<eos> Some college kids made it, ma'am.<eos> It's a comedy thing where they represent you as meat and act out news stories.
Excuse me?<eos> Harajuku.<eos> Uh, may I have the meaning of the word?<eos> Oh, you don't know?<eos> Then let me tell you.
Bird flu epidemic, deadly pollen virus... what was the last one?<eos> Shark hurricane?<eos> You have no idea how close that came to actually happening.<eos> Now you said "worked."<eos> What did Booker fire you for, being a crackpot, too?
No.<eos> That's not what happened. Poison?<eos> I loved him.<eos> I chose to stay behind and help him with the restaurant.<eos> After he dumped you.
Me likey.<eos> Oh, that's Debbie.<eos> She's great.<eos> She'll actually be here next week.<eos> I can introduce you.
Do you know where I was raised?<eos> Do you know what I had to do to become free?<eos> No.<eos> To you, I am an unlearned girl, unschooled, unpracticed.<eos> If I have offended you, I am very sorry.
You need to... (whispering indistinctly) I... have butter.<eos> I'm gonna get you a refill.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Andrew, can I talk to you for a second?<eos> - Let me top you up.
I packed my bags and left with no warning.<eos> Our fights just kept getting uglier, and even when we weren't arguing, I'd catch him just... staring at me.<eos> The look on his face...<eos> It felt like he was going to hurt me.<eos> You never reached out to the police, even after they began to suspect Gordon murdered you.
- Of course.<eos> - By the way...<eos> I'm a big fan of your work.<eos> Oh, God, kill me.<eos> So we understand you would like us to take down your video, and we hear you.
We have a responsibility, especially to the refugees.<eos> The Germans went through that country like a pack of wolves.<eos> They only have us to turn to.<eos> Yes, Matron.<eos> I see they decorated you for your distinguished service, Sister.
But I could tell them otherwise.<eos> Couldn't I?<eos> I could tell them that your tastes... are far more exotic.<eos> Sister Quayle... ..you've been working very hard and you must be exhausted.<eos> I'm sending you home on two weeks' leave.
Any connection to Renee Sheffield?<eos> No, not that I can see.<eos> When did he move to Las Vegas?<eos> 7 years ago.<eos> I don't have a current address yet, but fret not, my chickens, as soon as I do, I will hit you back.
It's completely ruined.<eos> - You're such a bitch!<eos> - Whoa, Debbie!<eos> She went into my room, she trashed all of my stuff, and she kicked all of my clothes under the bed.<eos> - I asked you to clean up.
So he... he wiped himself off with it and threw it in the trash.<eos> Thank you.<eos> That is a very disturbing story, Ms. Salim.<eos> Almost as disturbing as the account that you initially gave the police.<eos> In that story, you told the police that they had called you a Muslim bitch and had suggested that you go back to India.
Congratulations, Hildy.<eos> Okay, so, what about the criminal charges?<eos> The civil suit?<eos> Well, uh, Teresa ramos and D-Hop had a change of heart.<eos> They not only dropped their civil suit, but Mrs. ramos insisted that they give a sworn statement to D.A. investigators in which she not only verified that you acted in self-defense, she called you a hero.
Thanks to you, I was able to enjoy a good life.<eos> You seem to have such great gratitude to our Mal Soon.<eos> Gratitude? Yes!<eos> A huge amount of gratitude in fact!<eos> When you and your newborn son had no place to stay, my mother took you in and took care of you.
I'd like to move onto the property until this thing's over.<eos> He came to the house once.<eos> He might do it again.<eos> There's an in-law next to the garage.<eos> Semenchko will show you.
Danny, me thinks thou should shutteth uppeth.<eos> Not now.<eos> Riley, you need to hear this.<eos> Ow ow, easy there, robo-knight.<eos> Excuse me, is this knight bothering you?
It's not gonna be a problem.<eos> It's a problem.<eos> - Hey, what's up, Danny?<eos> - Tucker, Stephanie, hi.<eos> I almost didn't recognize you with your clothes on.
Did you kill her?<eos> No!<eos> Oh my God they think it's me.<eos> Where were you that day, Alya?<eos> No one at the ballet saw you 'til 3pm.
Remove all the misery you are able to remove." ~ A fellow Bentham fan?<eos> ~ I wouldn't go that far.<eos> I shall miss teaching him when I have to give all this up.<eos> But one of us has to stay at home full time now.<eos> I'm sorry if I offended you or your husband yesterday.
This music actually pulls his victims to his lair.<eos> I know where you're going with this.<eos> You play the music, I get all trancey and lead us to where the Piper is holding Sara.<eos> We have no idea what effect this may have on you.<eos> Not to mention, we'd be using you as bait.
This will feed six families for a week.<eos> Edward Sexby would not have denied food to the hungry.<eos> Come away, Abe.<eos> Let us take it, my Lady.<eos> Someday I shall help you in return.
Sir. I am here because you stole me.<eos> Now what shall you do with me?<eos> Make a jest of me?<eos> Ravish me?<eos> Would you have me ravish you?
You know what's different this time, Mrs. Florrick, from all the other times your husband has been investigated?<eos> This time, you were his lawyer.<eos> Yep, on election night.<eos> This time, you can go to prison yourself.<eos> That's what will really change you.
I thought I'd tidy them up for you.<eos> Have we met?<eos> No.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> I feel certain I know you.
Oh, I hadn't noticed.<eos> America.<eos> What a beautiful country.<eos> Nurse Nightingale.<eos> Mrs. Akalitus will see you now.
- Okay.<eos> What level of investment do you require?<eos> What's this, George? This is my lovely wife.<eos> This is Mr. Lowenstein.<eos> The woman who tames eagles. Your reputation precedes you.
Do you still have a stiff neck?<eos> When I woke up in the morning, it was gone!<eos> - That's good.<eos> So, the prince is adamant on separating me from my palace.<eos> He brought you along.
Okay.<eos> Okay. I'm gonna have to ask you to come with me.<eos> You're a-arresting me?<eos> Why?<eos> No, I'm not arresting you.
Why?<eos> No, I'm not arresting you.<eos> It's just I need you to make an official statement at the Hall of Justice, since we'll be pursuing murder charges against Mr. Strauss based on the statement that you made that you were not with him that night.<eos> We're also gonna have to impound your vehicle for a couple of days, just to verify that there's no hair or semen or DNA in the vehicle, so if you could just, uh, hand me over your keys.<eos> And then Inspector Mulligan will, uh, take you to 850 Bryant Street.
Haven't you heard?<eos> I'm crazy.<eos> And no-one can fix that.<eos> Thanks for all the chances you've given me.<eos> And I'm so sorry if I let you down.
So... Please just call me.<eos> Dani.<eos> You scared me.<eos> I just wasn't expecting you.<eos> No, I scare you for another reason.
I made... financial outlays...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I... told the partners.<eos> They were worried about your last name.<eos> They don't want you here as an associate.
Well, Humanichs<eos> - are different.<eos> - They're still machines.<eos> - They can't give back.<eos> - Then you should spend some time with my son... I think he could convince you otherwise.
I'm Kate McPherson from The Boston Globe.<eos> We spoke a few years ago.<eos> I'm writing a book about your son.<eos> Look, I wanna tell your side of the story.<eos> I know he was a good son to you, and I don't think he would've left you unless there was some compelling reason.
In her heart, fundamentally Dr. Frayn, you say she is good?<eos> I do.<eos> You see, now I always would have agreed with you...<eos> I mean, she cuts her cloth with the world the way we all must... but, I trusted her always, when pushed... to fall the right way.<eos> You would hope that those that love you, would say the same.
You say you were drugged...<eos> No.<eos> You said that.<eos> Although I imagine it so, yes.<eos> Forgive me, Lady Vera, but given the fact of where we have just now brought you from and where you were found, this face you offer to the world... some could call it heartless.
Oh, excuse me, I forget... you have no memory of the journey made to those rooms.<eos> Only your drugged champagne at The Cambridge, and then... oblivion.<eos> Correct?<eos> Correct.<eos> Then let us perhaps therefore, talk a little more broadly, of what it is brings you to Whitechapel.
Oh, and how you are jaded, my lady.<eos> Are you really so without hope for your life?<eos> Perhaps I am.<eos> I should say,<eos> Lady Vera, that the life that I imagine you wish to escape, that which brings you far from its genteel restrictions, perhaps at least the few hours you pass with us, that life is here.
No, Sergeant.<eos> I do not remember.<eos> If you would stand for me now, Major.<eos> Many a marriage has failed, as we all know, but such a striving to see one revived, Lady Vera. It suggests...<eos> A, ah... what should we call it... a... a commitment to the life which wearies you so.
Your workers are sent home, and this flattened land is repossessed for an altogether grander scheme.<eos> Remember just what choices you have.<eos> It is my way or the rope, daughter mine.<eos> Miss Hart.<eos> I was told to find you here, but...
You have quite an impressive poker face, Miss Thorne.<eos> You've been playing me from the start.<eos> Why would you say that?<eos> I think you're far smarter than the public knows.<eos> And I brought you here 'cause I believe your interest in me is only professional.
Thank you, my Laird.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Do you sew as well as physick, Mistress Beauchamp?<eos> Only flesh, which makes a rather poor garment,<eos> Just as well, I called you here on another matter.
Of course.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Do you find my legs as repellent as the tailor does?<eos> No, it's just, well, I believe it'd be more beneficial if rather than your legs, I massaged the base of your spine.<eos> Don't tell me my arse offends you too.
We're gonna need to quiet these people down.<eos> Sir I'm afraid that any attempt to get you down might trigger the device.<eos> Then find the bastard who strapped it to me.<eos> Are you sure that you have no idea...<eos> If I did, don't you think I damn well would have told you?
Hello.<eos> - Hi, Zohar.<eos> It's nice to meet you.<eos> So, where the store?<eos> I would show you, but I can not... depart from here.
I'm gonna make sure that she is banned from Marlborough, Harvard-Westlake, all of them.<eos> 'Cause your husband fucked my girlfriend.<eos> Mrs. Sullivan? I'm Kate McPherson from the Boston Globe.<eos> I'm writing a book about your son.<eos> I don't think he would have left you unless there was some compelling reason.
Taking a break from dating is the best.<eos> All the energy you once spent prepping and planning for dates can be put to better use, like pursuing old passions.<eos> After a while, you don't even miss having a boyfriend.<eos> Except when you have elective surgery to unweb your toes and there's no one to take you home.<eos> So there's no one to take you home?
But that's not gonna work...<eos> Because of the anesthesia And driving myself home.<eos> I'll just go tomorrow.<eos> Teddy can take me.<eos> I'll drive you to and from the dentist's office myself.
You know, Monopoly, Parcheesi, Clue.<eos> Wow, first you have sex with this guy's girlfriend, now you're having sex with his sister?<eos> I'm going with Larry, in the living room, with the lead pipe.<eos> Larry actually wants us to spend more time together now that I'm dating Gretchen.<eos> How's Lyndsey taking you moving on?
My father's soul?<eos> Edogawa has been trapped in this sword for decades, because of Pennyworth, and he said nothing!<eos> - Your father's soul in pain.<eos> - No!<eos> Avenge your father, and I will set you free.
Allowing foster children to get their own lawyers would set a dangerous precedent.<eos> And turning a blind eye to free legal help is a perfect example of how this state fails in loco parentis.<eos> - I agree, Ms. Kaswell.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> If you want to represent Ryan, I'm not going to stop you.
My team is frustrated, Madame Secretary.<eos> And I can't say that I blame them.<eos> Yes, I know, but...<eos> Of course.<eos> Yes, I'll keep you posted.
There's a chance that he might be hiding out there, but I think he's smarter than that, so...<eos> I'm sorry, but, uh, last night, your partner told me that you thought... he'd raided one of his dad's charities.<eos> So I was just pondering which of those stories was true.<eos> If, indeed... either one is.<eos> I wonder... if I were to hold you down and threaten to put one of your eyes out with my thumb... would you tell me where you're hiding him?
I was supposed to leave--<eos> Your flight leaves tonight.<eos> The job begins next week.<eos> They'll set you up with an apartment, stipend, all under the name on that passport.<eos> Lionel here will get you to the airport safely.
Bad info.<eos> So my being here was just a waste of time.<eos> We apologize.<eos> On behalf of NCIS and the CIA.<eos> This agent will escort you out.
Did you see Officer Cutter apply a choke hold to Collins in that bathroom?<eos> I've been riding with Randy for over a year.<eos> He's the best cop I know, and he saved my life on more than one occasion so I can go home to my kid.<eos> So, in other words, you're willing to lie for him.<eos> Because when I call you in front of that grand jury, you will be under oath.
Can't you just give me something?<eos> I can't comment on the case.<eos> I understand.<eos> But I can ask you a question.<eos> Do you really think we'd be trailing you if we weren't fairly certain that your husband were going to contact you?
Aren't you gonna wish me luck?<eos> Getting this seat means everything to us.<eos> Good luck, mother.<eos> They'd be lucky to get you on their stupid council.<eos> The mayor is ready for you, Mrs. Bates.
Does he decide that he was punished or that he was rewarded?<eos> Will he be angry for having been made to suffer, or will he be grateful for that suffering because... it changed him?<eos> This is the story of a little girl.<eos> She's 8 years old, and just over a week ago, she's playing in the park.<eos> She loves to go high on the swings, up to the point where you hang there for a moment, suspended, before the chains clink and gravity pulls you back down.
Thank you.<eos> Sondra, I need you to locate the number of a Finn Polmar.<eos> He's the new ASA at the state's attorney's office.<eos> He just got released from the hospital.<eos> Sure. Do you want me to connect you?
I don't think feelings can be fixed.<eos> Well, if you need any more unhelpful advice, I'll be around.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I'm always looking for the least-helpful advice.<eos> - Well, let me help you with this.
She didn't wear perfume, because it irritated her patients.<eos> And this earring was gaudy, with rhinestones and stuff.<eos> Lyla barely wears studs.<eos> You met her, right?<eos> You may think that this clears you, but it actually gives you another motive, which is jealousy.
The code of the hive is clear.<eos> But, no, we have agreed to spare you.<eos> I would allow nothing else.<eos> Still... to the issue at hand.<eos> He will interrogate you.
Mistress Hawkins.<eos> Henry.<eos> I didn't know you were back.<eos> It's a long story.<eos> John will tell you.
The King's business, Sarah.<eos> What have you done with David?<eos> A penny for the pie shop.<eos> I thought it better to work uninterrupted.<eos> Forgive me, I have deceived you.
How can I confess to something I did not do?<eos> ~ (GROANS) ~ Please.<eos> Search your conscience.<eos> I am not that person.<eos> Perhaps I believe you.
My son...<eos> But I was the one man who could have brought him back to you.<eos> My lord...<eos> Sarah.<eos> Let me help you.
Be careful.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Uh, I'm just here to see my son, Dylan Massett.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Didn't recognize you.
If you'll excuse me.<eos> Don't run off.<eos> You don't know what you're missing.<eos> Honestly, mr. Auerbach, I don't care.<eos> It's no wonder people don't take you seriously.
It's almost time.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Listen, before you leave, it would be really important if I asked a few more questions.<eos> It's helpful for the investigation.<eos> Um, tell me again about what you remember of how they transported you.
It deserves to be in the right hands.<eos> Here we present the happy couple, Mr and Mrs Preston!<eos> Any words for the people at home?<eos> My...wife and I are gratified that so many kind well-wishers could be here to join the celebration of our nuptials.<eos> A simply wonderful time is wished by us to you.
No.<eos> I've come about the leaky tap.<eos> Nurse Franklin, I can't believe you just did that.<eos> What?<eos> Referred to my costume when all the kiddies could hear you!
- He is.<eos> - And it would hurt your firm's bottom line if he were in prison?<eos> - Objection.<eos> Relevance. - Sustained.<eos> The police first questioned you about Mr. Sweeney's
I lent Catherine my men some time ago.<eos> Why do you ask?<eos> I, um, wanted to employ him to help me find Catherine.<eos> My dear.<eos> You need to be a much better liar if you want anyone to take you seriously.
And now she's got you doing it, too.<eos> You're trying to gauge my involvement in the slaughter of your countrymen.<eos> Well, I had nothing to do with it.<eos> I loaned Catherine those men long before she planned the incident.<eos> And if you intend to say otherwise, I'll deal with you in the same way as Beatrice.
Not Mary?<eos> Then who?<eos> Answer carefully.<eos> If you lie, I won't tell you where to find the money.<eos> Someone who's hated you for a long time.
Bullshit.<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> No, you're not sorry.<eos> Sorry people don't write fucking books. Wait a minute.<eos> Ma'am, if I've offended you in any way, that was not my...
Is the well with the lie.<eos> You do not!<eos> That ? what a ? be brave.<eos> The Lady ? ? Integrates has the heart ?<eos> ? imposs? vel do not forgive you.
No.<eos> No. Not unhappy.<eos> In fact, I'm actually starting to do a little stomping here.<eos> Ah. I'm sure Norman and Rita will be very happy to hear that.<eos> They admire you and your remarkable...
Must I do everything myself?<eos> Miss Hopkins, may I have a word?<eos> Your father has been freed.<eos> I see.<eos> And he's been looking for you, asks that you come home immediately.
She's Amanda Clarke!<eos> She's been obsessing over this theory for months.<eos> When I found her digging up Amanda's grave, I-I tried to calm her down, but she attacked me.<eos> She's lying!<eos> The authorities initiated a 5150 and brought you here.
Yeah, I think I knew that.<eos> He was six weeks old.<eos> She never really wanted him, but she couldn't do anything about it in time because I didn't know she was pregnant, and she refused to believe that she was, I think.<eos> I think that's what was going on in there, and...<eos> Tell me if I'm boring you.
I was wondering if you'd like to comment further.<eos> This car is half empty.<eos> I looked around. I didn't see anyone near me except that guy with the headphones.<eos> - I was sitting right here.<eos> - Why didn't I see you?
‚ô™ O, hear us when we cry to Thee ‚ô™<eos> ‚ô™ For those in peril on the sea ‚ô™<eos> ‚ô™ O Savior whose almighty word ‚ô™<eos> ‚ô™ The winds and waves submissive heard... ‚ô™<eos> Yes, I definitely understood you.
Denise?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Huh. Well, maybe they dispatched somebody else.<eos> As long as it's working, have a great day.<eos> I didn't ask you to bug you or to, uh, to hound you about giving me a second chance.
So you believe He exists.<eos> They proved the theorem, not the existence.<eos> I already know He doesn't exist. All right?<eos> So if you can't tell me what's wrong with me, at least tell me you know how to make it go away.<eos> I could give you drugs that will turn you into a zombie.
I'm not sure what he's done is even illegal.<eos> Do you keep photos of dead American soldiers on your laptop?<eos> What I saw was an angry kid.<eos> - Who's down there?<eos> - I told you.
He was IRGC-trained.<eos> Breaking would have taken days.<eos> We had hours.<eos> Who did the interview?<eos> I just told you, I did.
You fuck with us, we fuck with you.<eos> Why you so angry, Etai?<eos> I don't like being lied to, especially by my friends.<eos> You're in the wrong business.<eos> Listen, if I knew for a fact Iran was close to a nuclear weapon, I'd tell you.
Can I help you, ma'am?<eos> Ray Conlin's a good guy.<eos> I'm not sure why he's trying to help this asshole.<eos> Same as me. He wants to know what happened yesterday.<eos> I told you on the phone... Some guy with PTSD took some hostages, tried to kill some cops.
Three candidates I would never consider for any position at any time.<eos> I'm sorry you feel that way.<eos> You can't really have expected anything different.<eos> Actually, I did.<eos> And I'd ask you to reconsider-- advise you to.
You can get in.<eos> It's true what you said last night-- about Berlin.<eos> I told myself... I was doing what you would want me to do, preventing an attack.<eos> - Look, I-I--<eos> - And I should have told you.
It's good.<eos> I just got off the phone with George Pallis, the solicitor general.<eos> He's excited about the van.<eos> Law enforcement's already on the way.<eos> Plus, he's coming personally to handle the immunity situation with you.
At the behest of the blessed Cuthbert.<eos> The doors are open to the elements, Brother Trew, nothing more.<eos> It can be done, Lord, it can be arranged... with your help and guidance.<eos> And you shall have it, Brother Trew, I'm sure.<eos> Father Beocca, I will send for you when I have read the letter, which I shall do immediately, do not wander.
Red-haired women!<eos> To the shield wall that awaits us!<eos> To the joy of battle!<eos> And to the blood of the Scots!<eos> Father Hrothweard, we've been waiting for you.
We have.<eos> All those that did not flee.<eos> The holy city of Eoferwic welcomes you.<eos> We will give you food and shelter and thanks, Lord Uhtred.<eos> God bless you.
In Australia.<eos> Is that true?<eos> It... it wasn't her.<eos> What he saw was... was... it was a manifestation of... it was... she wasn't real.<eos> And if I told you, you would've...
Why does it matter?<eos> Well, somebody wants... somebody in your family wants to know.<eos> But you said there is no family.<eos> Sir, we have a situation.<eos> We need to move you now.
It was too late.<eos> And I knew that if I told you what happened... that you would never believe me.<eos> I believe you.<eos> You do?<eos> Why wouldn't I believe you?
Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey.<eos> I told him I was texting with someone from Chechnya, but it was over.<eos> That I explained everything to you, and you believed it.
No. No, those who, for whatever their reasons, murder innocent people.<eos> On that score, your wife is second to none.<eos> And you're a liar.<eos> I wonder if you really don't know what I'm talking about.<eos> I'd tell you to ask her, but you're never gonna see her again.
If you might use my library.<eos> Is there any book you're looking for in particular?<eos> A cookbook, so we can make dinner.<eos> I suppose anything but lamb.<eos> Well, my private library is open to you whenever you'd like.
Maybe... Maybe you didn't go to your father because, in the end, he wasn't that important to you.<eos> Maybe you're not the son you thought you were.<eos> I can imagine facing that truth would be particularly painful.<eos> You and I? We are getting closer and closer, Will.<eos> Mr. Wrangler will see you now.
Maybe... Maybe you didn't go to your father because, in the end, he wasn't that important to you.<eos> Maybe you're not the son you thought you were.<eos> I can imagine facing that truth would be particularly painful.<eos> You and I? We are getting closer and closer, Will.<eos> Mr. Wrangler will see you now.
There are so many hardworking mothers and fathers out there.<eos> This could've happened to any of them.<eos> We are close to capturing your son, Ms. Masterson, and I will do my best to have you see him.<eos> I want to go.<eos> No one's keeping you.
You wanna come take a look at something for me? Hmm?<eos> You wanna tell me how this got over here?<eos> You seriously threatening to bust us over weed<eos> - in 20-motherfucking-16?<eos> - You'll know when I'm threatening you.
I'm Leo, with flow plumbers.<eos> - Right.<eos> - I received a call the other day.<eos> Of course, yes.<eos> My husband called you.
My rates have gone up a little bit since the last time i worked for you.<eos> I get $2000 in a day now because I picked up an associate, and you'll have to cover my expenses.<eos> And I'll need a $10,000 retainer.<eos> -That's not a problem, okay.<eos> I'm just going to need you for a couple of days.
Rohan!<eos> The hospital is here.<eos> - Thank you, sir.<eos> Your report is ready.<eos> The doctor will see you now.
Something happened!<eos> We lost our house.<eos> That's what happened.<eos> No, they wouldn't run!<eos> I'm telling you. They wouldn't do this.
- Will!<eos> Come on, all your weapons down.<eos> Hey, Hugo!<eos> That's not my problem.<eos> I'd tell you, but we need the medic before he bleeds out.
Come on, all your weapons down.<eos> Hey, Hugo!<eos> That's not my problem.<eos> I'd tell you, but we need the medic before he bleeds out.<eos> I'm telling you. Hugo!
I'm Vanessa.<eos> I'm your greatgreatgranddaughter.<eos> How can I possibly be related to you?<eos> I've never met you before in my life.<eos> But I've met you in my life.
- Hi.<eos> Who's that?<eos> You didn't get my message?<eos> When did you send the message?<eos> I texted you this morning.
Thank you, dear.<eos> Excuse me, Miss Hunnicutt.<eos> Mr. Perkins did ask me to come by at 2:00.<eos> And so you have.<eos> Mr. Perkins will see you now.
Yeah. Hey, what's up, Lani?<eos> Hey. So, uh, you got a second?<eos> I need to tell you something.<eos> I was talking about how great it'd be if the Hang 5 asked me to join.<eos> Oh, um, okay. You think they might ask you?
Why would you want him to do that?<eos> George Selway attacked me.<eos> So, you and Mark Costley were an item.<eos> You were sleeping together.<eos> No, I've told you.
Last call!<eos> Anyone who still needs to vote should go right now!<eos> Just because we've already won Virginia doesn't mean you shouldn't cast your ballot.<eos> I want "I voted" stickers on everyone!<eos> I never told you, but POTUS is on with our guy right now.
- Okay, all right.<eos> - All right?<eos> - Okay.<eos> Ellen... be strong, okay?<eos> Hey, I'm really sorry if I got you in any sort of trouble...
And hurry up.<eos> Sunny.<eos> Here.<eos> I'll find you.<eos> Both of you, I promise.
It's all he's ever cared about.<eos> Is that true?<eos> 'Course not.<eos> So the monastery...<eos> Did you come because you wanted to save Sunny or because I told you about the compass?
Please.<eos> I can't believe this shit.<eos> Why don't we go ahead and show the video.<eos> My name is Richard Taggart, and I'm the face of America.<eos> Everything that I'm about to tell you comes from my heart.
I got this.<eos> Please tell me they're not coming.<eos> - Who?<eos> - The kids.<eos> I thought I told you.
My point is, it's awful, isn't it, that this is what happened to him.<eos> Like...<eos> Why are you crying?<eos> Did you even know Wes?<eos> Did any of you?
Bring these guys to the back.<eos> They make a move, he makes a call.<eos> Yeah?<eos> I think you're bluffing.<eos> I warned you.
Come on.<eos> Take a breath.<eos> Start breathing evenly.<eos> In and out.<eos> Feel the weight of your limbs pulling you down.
I couldn't tell the hospital the truth.<eos> They would ask too many questions.<eos> Fucking bitch!<eos> They wouldn't understand.<eos> That's why they put you on the donor list.
That wasn't the first time you felt like a freak.<eos> It's not about your face.<eos> You've been this way for a long time.<eos> Who hurt you, Alex?<eos> Who hurt you so badly that you couldn't stop yourself from hurting Nora, too?
Okay but...<eos> -Sebastian?<eos> -Yes?<eos> What was it in your photo?<eos> I'll tell you sometime.
Uh, I'm not too big on Shadowhunter parties.<eos> Izzy, hey. Where have you been?<eos> - Out.<eos> - Hey, I'm sorry.<eos> I feel horrible that I kept the rune from you.
I am calling security. Great idea.<eos> Security, no, that's...<eos> Security is awesome.<eos> You aren't planning on going rogue on us, now, were you, Rip?<eos> I have told you.
I mean, we used to go with your mum and dad this time of year.<eos> Stop it.<eos> Your attempts to elicit an emotional response by reminding me of shared memories is clumsy and pathetic.<eos> The last memory I have is of you killing the best friend and teacher I ever had.<eos> You mean that old geezer that... kidnapped you, poisoned your mind, then tried to turn you into a mass murderer.
No.<eos> No, that's not real.<eos> What's real is every time that you were sick when you were a kid... your mum used to sit up with you all night and read to you till you fell asleep. That's real.<eos> Or when you were seven and you took your silly rowing boat out and you got lost in that storm, and me and your dad were out, shouting and screaming, losing our minds.<eos> And when your dad found you, how he cried.
I'm the one you seek.<eos> I'm the demon's head.<eos> I am Ra's al Ghul.<eos> RA'S AL GHUL: Why have you come to me, Bruce?<eos> The Sensei told me to seek you out.
He's wrong.<eos> Your destiny is to be Bruce Wayne.<eos> And one day, you're gonna remember that.<eos> And you're gonna remember how much I love you.<eos> I remember the first time your mum and dad brought you home.
Hi, Barry.<eos> I'm here to see Rebecca.<eos> She's not expecting me, but I thought I'd drop these by for her.<eos> Rebecca moved out six weeks ago.<eos> Didn't she tell you?
Well, hey, if there's anything I can do to help, or whatever, you know, I'm here.<eos> Just talk to her.<eos> Be a good influence.<eos> - She likes you.<eos> She says she likes you.
You just want me to work so you have a job.<eos> Hey, I could get a job without you, okay?<eos> I just prefer to have a job with you, 'cause you're cool, all right?<eos> But you should do what you want, okay?<eos> Whatever you decide, I'll... I'll support you.
So what's going on at home?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Mom and Reggie were arguing a lot, and then all of a sudden he goes to Hong Kong.<eos> There's been an officer-involved shooting.<eos> I got a call to pick you up and bring you to the scene.
- you know, my situation.<eos> - Yeah. Yeah, me, too.<eos> My PO is saying, "You'll be out of here in a few months."<eos> - For real?<eos> - Told you, I've been doing good.
Move on the targets!<eos> Freeze!<eos> Thank you, Captain.<eos> Happy to help.<eos> It didn't hurt that the mayor vouched for you.
This is a truth that I was keeping myself from seeing, and I am no longer doing that.<eos> Anatoly and his men will kill Adrian Chase.<eos> That is the solution.<eos> The team is done.<eos> So I'm telling you.
Seriously, are you still not listening to me?<eos> Did the EMP give you short-term amnesia about what we were arguing about down here in the first place?<eos> This feels like the best choice right now.<eos> Besides the one I just gave you.<eos> I told you so, I told you so, I told you so.
Something like that.<eos> You want to talk about it?<eos> Not really.<eos> Ok.<eos> Well, if you did, I'd tell you about Vinnie and me.
Having a little backslide?<eos> Hanging under the wagon isn't easy.<eos> Looks like sister Sarah is starting to come around.<eos> Finally ready to admit little lizzy had some help filling her lungs with water.<eos> You should ask her, she'll tell you now.
So I don't know what the plan is when she wakes up again.<eos> I really feel like this time we bit off more than we can handle, and then her condition only complicates things.<eos> - Now which condition would that be?<eos> The fact that she's possessed or pregnant.<eos> - If what Richard told you is true than this thing inside her is less than a day old.
No, you wanna kill her.<eos> - Hey, Richard.<eos> - Fuck you get out!<eos> - Richard I'm trying to help her.<eos> - Yeah, but now that you realize you can't, you're gonna kill her, she can read your mind, she talks to me, she's begging me to stop you.
Holden.<eos> Come on.<eos> He's had a tough day.<eos> Dozens of ships leave here every day.<eos> Pick one, and I'll get you on it.
Yeah, I guess she lives nearby and wanted to talk it through in person.<eos> - Allison wasn't present?<eos> She been keeping up with her meetings?<eos> Yeah, she's committed to her recovery.<eos> I told you.
It's a good story.<eos> Just ask.<eos> Lawyer, please.<eos> I thought maybe you were gonna say something different.<eos> So this guy Moon robbed you?
Like, weirder than normal.<eos> You're right.<eos> I should want him dead.<eos> "Should"?<eos> Oswald... you loved him, and he betrayed you.
Only what I already told you, Alfred.<eos> The clone came to me.<eos> Talking about how Gotham's gonna be judged and a lot of people are gonna die.<eos> It's the bloody Court of Owls, isn't it?<eos> Mm-hmm. I warned you.
I mean, we used to go with your mum and dad this time of year.<eos> Stop it.<eos> Your attempts to elicit an emotional response by reminding me of shared memories is clumsy and pathetic.<eos> The last memory I have is of you killing the best friend and teacher I ever had.<eos> You mean that old geezer that... kidnapped you, poisoned your mind, then tried to turn you into a mass murderer.

Everyone's gotta go sometime, right?<eos> And I am pretty sure today just... isn't my day.<eos> What the hell, sis?<eos> Are you trying to get yourself killed?<eos> God, okay, look, we gotta get you out of here before CCPD sees you.
Pretty soon I'm gonna be faster than you.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Well, until then, what's my name?<eos> Joe, hey, this one, is...<eos> Pretty ghastly, Detective, I warn you.
Now... he's all mine.<eos> No!<eos> Hey! Do not hurt him.<eos> I'm the one you want!<eos> - Right? - I warned you, Flash.
You'll see.<eos> Do you have any idea how hard it is to be a black country artist?<eos> 'Hasn't been one on the charts since Darius Rucker.'<eos> And there's never been a successful woman.<eos> 'If you'd asked me' I would have told you.
Hey, what's up with all the news trucks outside?<eos> They hired some mega movie star from China.<eos> So..<eos> But all the roles are already cast.<eos> I'm just, just tellin' you what I heard.
Mom, why are you doing this to me?<eos> Because you're a vampire, Caroline.<eos> I'm ashamed to know I raised the monster that's killing the people I'm supposed to protect.<eos> No!<eos> I told you, Damon is the one who's doing it, not me!
Lucious. Is everything okay?<eos> Everything's absolutely fine.<eos> Look, I know you've got concerns about Inferno's crowd, but I assure you, you'll be able to bring your husband and your kids to this place.<eos> My father is a man of his word, Ms. Frost.<eos> I can assure you.
I will come in and beat...<eos> Carol?<eos> Carol, you got this.<eos> Trying to act like you a damsel in distress when I know you got nerves of steel.<eos> I'm telling you, I don't trust me.
This is my shop.<eos> - Was there a fight at the party?<eos> - Yeah. Bloody Ed!<eos> He was as much at fault.<eos> Don't let him tell you otherwise.
- You were working all night?<eos> - Till three.<eos> The graveyard shift.<eos> So, we were talking to your radio controller.<eos> She said you developed a fault with your radio halfway through the night and she couldn't contact you.
You have to dial it back.<eos> 11 grand for our little boy's life?<eos> I don't want compensation, I want justice.<eos> We don't want it.<eos> We're telling you.
- What time did you get back?<eos> Half-six, seven, in the morning.<eos> Was your wife up when you got back?<eos> She'll remember me getting in.<eos> Anyone see you on the beach?
Your girlfriend was there too?<eos> She used to work at the farm shop with Cath.<eos> She got invited.<eos> I dropped her off early that evening, that's why I was there.<eos> I didn't tell you cos I was scared.
Uhtred!<eos> - Is she married?<eos> - Yes!<eos> He is a man of God!<eos> Say it one more time, priest, and I swear the devil will take you.
This is where we part.<eos> We will show ourselves only when we know the east door has been opened.<eos> We will attack... then it's up to you to save us.<eos> We will be theirs to slaughter.<eos> Lord, may the gods be with you.
You knew who she was before I worked it out.<eos> You knew, and you didn't say, did you?<eos> Oh, my God, I can't believe it. We're back here again!<eos> You doing stuff you shouldn't be, and me having to cover it up.<eos> Suri, if I knew anything else, I'd tell you.
But we're all different ages.<eos> I want to talk to you about something.<eos> I recently received a call from Mr. Poe.<eos> Is that so?<eos> I'm sorry Mr. Poe bothered you.
I also killed his assistant, Gustav.<eos> I drowned him in the reflecting pond.<eos> The question is...<eos> what are you going to do about it?<eos> I'm going to send you to jail for a very long time.
I find it helpful to leave the country now and then.<eos> See some ruins, wait for the manhunt to die down, eat some cuy.<eos> You won't be eating any cuy, unless it's served in a prison cafeteria.<eos> Why would I be eating in a prison cafeteria?<eos> Because I'm taking you to prison.
I see you.<eos> Goodnight.<eos> Goodnight, baby.<eos> Sweet dreams.<eos> I was gonna tell you.
Yours?<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Yeah. Ahem.<eos> It's hers.<eos> I was going to tell you.
Pete, get the lights.<eos> Uh, Pete and I lost a client yesterday.<eos> We wanted to make sure her collateral was, um, secure, and I couldn't open the safe.<eos> Oh, I changed the combination.<eos> Didn't I tell you?
What look?<eos> The look you just gave him and the one he gave you back.<eos> Oh, my God, did you know about this?<eos> No.<eos> Grace, I would have told you.
Okay...<eos> Sounds good to me. Can I go now?<eos> - Don't you want to know what's going on?<eos> - No, not really.<eos> Well, you pulled me out of an Ed Sheeran concert, so I feel like I kind of owe you.
Come with me.<eos> I'm Dan Bennett, Chief of the Special Police Division.<eos> Welcome back.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Your reputation precedes you.
I thought I told you to get the riff-raff out of my office.<eos> I knew it.<eos> Sorry, Mr. Wolf.<eos> I won't let it happen again.<eos> You know, when I first met you, I really thought you were something.
I need Morse to guard Bakewell at Cowley General.<eos> Is there something you wanted?<eos> Mr... Mr Bakewell, is it?<eos> Hospital Library.<eos> What can I tempt you to?
Since the divorce.<eos> - And it's voluntary, you said? - Oh, yes.<eos> I don't get paid.<eos> But my mother was a patient here, rest her soul, and they were so good to her, I just wanted to do something.<eos> Well, I'll leave you to it.
I suppose you think that's pathetic.<eos> I didn't do anything to Bakewell.<eos> Where were you last night?<eos> Finished my shift here, got home at 11.<eos> Right. Anyone vouch for you?
- Brace him for round two.<eos> See if there's anything else in there we can put to him.<eos> - He's sleeping.<eos> - Probably for the best.<eos> I've told you already, it's not mine.
You better think about what you're doing.<eos> We're doing our job.<eos> You're not helping Burkhardt.<eos> I suggest you take me back now.<eos> We're not taking you back.
Well, I can't pass up such an invitation.<eos> Just so you know, if I wind up missing or dead, you're suspect number one.<eos> You're no good to me dead.<eos> I tried to convince him otherwise, but...<eos> We have enough evidence to convince the grand jury to put you on trial for her murder.
You're not me!<eos> Wu, start the car!<eos> Be careful.<eos> My reputation's on the line<eos> Any idea who will replace you as mayor?
- Oh, fuck me.<eos> - Congressman Ryan! I haven't spoken to you since the historic House vote.<eos> Yes...<eos> I just wanted to thank you for all that you've done for me.<eos> And I wanna let you know that I will destroy you in ways that are so creative, they will honor me for it at the Kennedy Center.
I'm not afraid of those guys.<eos> Montez and Doyle, they're trying to make Georgia more like America.<eos> Look, I saw your last election.<eos> No, thank you.<eos> Well, I can't argue with you there, Murman.
Genesis is a "mistake."<eos> But I think it was meant for something.<eos> - Like what?<eos> - I said it before.<eos> Told you back in Annville.
- Robert...<eos> I'm not looking to get in a fight with you.<eos> But as my partner told you before, we don't need your charity.<eos> Then I'll stop giving it to you.<eos> But you better put that dog on a leash and shut that shit down, or I'll shut you down.
I was your mother.<eos> I was supposed to protect you... not scar you.<eos> Harvey... I am so sorry.<eos> I don't hate you, Mom.<eos> I hate what you did, and I probably always will, but I don't hate you.
When I was 14, I had to make myself look older to get a job.<eos> These were the ones I used, and they are real cheap.<eos> You're gonna want to stay away from open flames and altercations at outlet malls.<eos> Hey...<eos> I'm really sorry that I didn't tell you about Jianyu and that you got saddled with him.
I don't know.<eos> Well, I hope you find him.<eos> I will.<eos> You know, Preacher, I believe you just might.<eos> Got you that time.
Can you watch mark for me until his grandmother gets here?<eos> I'm...<eos> I'm supposed to take notes for hobbs.<eos> During this interview, so...<eos> Hey. I asked you very nicely.
Helicopter?<eos> I know nothing about helicopters.<eos> Or arizona, for that matter.<eos> Sir, on your property, we found gps beacons. Used to track down bales of pot.<eos> And two guys from arizona named you as their supplier.
It meant a lot to fernando, but also to me.<eos> Well, it seems that your english suddenly got a lot better.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sometimes it's better. To let your children underestimate you a little.<eos> Well, I hope that, um, We didn't say anything that offended you.
Let's go.<eos> Hey, talk to Hector's lawyer again.<eos> See if she's convinced him to make a deal.<eos> Like I keep saying, I wasn't there.<eos> We have a witness that ID'd you, swears he saw you there.
Hey, talk to Hector's lawyer again.<eos> See if she's convinced him to make a deal.<eos> Like I keep saying, I wasn't there.<eos> We have a witness that ID'd you, swears he saw you there.<eos> Picked you out of that lineup in two seconds flat.
So he has no choice than to take a deal.<eos> Go pick him up.<eos> Your wife blew up your alibi.<eos> She said you came home around 2:00 a.m. and you had blood on your shoes.<eos> That incriminates you, Hector.
Go pick him up.<eos> Your wife blew up your alibi.<eos> She said you came home around 2:00 a.m. and you had blood on your shoes.<eos> That incriminates you, Hector.<eos> That puts you at the scene.
I am entitled!<eos> Every day, for the rest of his life, your son will suffer the shame of knowing his mother betrayed her king, her country and her family!<eos> As for you, you will be decapitated before the entire court.<eos> You are walking blindly towards an enemy that you do not know.<eos> You have opened the door to him and now he will destroy you.
Yes.<eos> I also believe in divine forgiveness.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Good night, Sire.<eos> Your mistress will be waiting for you.
Like, um, Google named their first building Building 40, so that people would think they were already huge.<eos> When I worked at my first startup, I would transfer people to "my supervisor," and then I'd just get back on the phone myself.<eos> Uh, yeah, hello.<eos> No, no, I'm not gonna go on hold again.<eos> Um, in fact, could I transfer you to my supervisor?
Guess we should've, dr.<eos> I don't think that's very funny.<eos> A word, doctor?<eos> Can you explain what that was about?<eos> They didn't call you. Because they don't think you're very good. With emotionally distraught people.
Ever had any heart problems before?<eos> Little chest pain here and there.<eos> My doc's got me on some pills.<eos> Okay, well, he should've told you not to jump in a frozen river.<eos> The shock is probably what tipped you over the edge.
That'll show Mother that my judgment can be trusted.<eos> - Oh, take me with you. - No.<eos> She's taken my allowance, Emily.<eos> You are a donkey.<eos> Marie-Louise, take a message to Mrs. Wells for me, I beg you.
When the harlot in your arms removes her mask, a grinning death's head is all that you will see.<eos> Madam.<eos> I am the curate from St. Clement Danes.<eos> Hearing of your indisposition, I've come to preach in your stead.<eos> Who sent you?
Was everything to your satisfaction?<eos> Your daughter... is a goddess, and I will take her into keeping and treat her as such.<eos> She's young.<eos> Her needs must be protected by a contract.<eos> I'll have one drawn up and sent to you, along with adequate remuneration for you, of course.
I suggest a weekly repayment of 25 pounds, at a rate of interest to be agreed.<eos> There's little to keep me here since my father died.<eos> If I have no amusements, I'll go home to Virginia.<eos> The interest is continued repayment in kind.<eos> Our girls won't have you.
Then I'll go and tell her that her concerns are misplaced.<eos> She's just been taken from me by the constables.<eos> For your murder?<eos> I don't know what she's told you but I assume you're the reason she couldn't settle with her gentleman.<eos> It was an ill day when she met you.
And you'll take the noose to protect her...<eos> I admire that, I admire your fortitude, Margaret Wells.<eos> - I'll bring her before me.<eos> - Please.<eos> I beg you;
No, thank you.<eos> This room gets such nice light in the morning.<eos> What do you want, Fred?<eos> I want to apologize.<eos> I said some cruel things to you and I'm very sorry.
Abby's going through a really hard time right now so you're not going to suspend her, because if you do I will make your life miserable.<eos> I can sell your home, I can fuck up your Zillow estimate.<eos> I can rezone your neighborhood for horses.<eos> I have a notary that will do anything for me.<eos> I am a realtor and I can destroy you.
That is a lawsuit against Donna's new business.<eos> I know what it is.<eos> Well, why haven't you told her about it yet?<eos> Because she's gonna think that I blew it because I was upset about Tara.<eos> Louis, did you go full-blown you on some poor bastard and ruin Donna's chance at success?
I want to do what we said we were gonna do and rebuild this place together.<eos> Well, what about what you owe me?<eos> You said we were partners.<eos> We are partners.<eos> Which is why I came to you with this.
So, can we stay for a while?<eos> Maybe have that drink?<eos> It's all about the bar tonight.<eos> Why?<eos> I like the way that people treat you.
You have a confusing resume.<eos> What's with the, fox-trot from Southern District to Eastern and back?<eos> Nothing.<eos> It happens.<eos> It never occurred to you that Rhoades was moving you around to serve his purposes whenever he found himself holding a Yarborough?
I took an oath.<eos> The same oath sworn by you, in fact, to the people of the United States.<eos> And when I see that someone is putting his own interests above that oath, there is nothing I like better than making sure they never get another job in the legal profession f-for the rest of their lives.<eos> Know this.<eos> I had you... in the cross hairs.
And to be honest, I like the way it makes me feel when I choose sides.<eos> Well, that's something I can understand.<eos> Understand this, too, then.<eos> I know you're not satisfied with what you've learned.<eos> Your search will continue, and it may take you down a great number of paths.
I'm not really sure I'm entirely comfortable with that.<eos> My last candidate who did not use her... was Spitzer.<eos> I'll fit her right in.<eos> And we need to do it right now because of the attention this, unofficial campaign visit will bring.<eos> I'd have told you if I'd thought that...
Colonel Cooke, Judge Woodhull's corrupt patron, protected his son before, and no doubt will do so again.<eos> So, a full confession will be required.<eos> I'll take dictation.<eos> Never gonna happen.<eos> I encourage you to reconsider.
- You don't just forget English. - Mm-mm.<eos> He just went full Chinaman on me.<eos> Okay, this is Ambassador Al Jaffar's nephew.<eos> I know you!<eos> I didn't recognize you with your little hat.
Why are you picking me?<eos> Because you're so tall.<eos> Oh, God, who the fuck invited Dikembe Mutomtard?<eos> A little word of advice, Congressman, don't wear the shorts.<eos> Even Kobe Bryant wouldn't rape you in those things.
Ivan was very small, and I did not want to give up!<eos> I thought that, being small, he could not beat me.<eos> Your husband is a fighter.<eos> What happened to your husband?<eos> - Did he tell you?
I don't know.<eos> Everything got blurry after she touched my boobs.<eos> Han, I'm about to say what you said to me when you were trying to get into an R-rated movie.<eos> I need your help.<eos> I told you three times, I don't fit up drain pipes.
I came to the 13th 'cause I lost a friend, too.<eos> So just... just give me a few hours.<eos> Please.<eos> Gideon, as your chief counsel,<eos> I need to remind you you're talking about a $5 million piece of equipment.
That wasn't my end.<eos> Sutter, he took care of all that.<eos> Talking about two or three hundred trucks.<eos> If you want this deal, we need to know everything.<eos> I'm telling you, I don't know.
You still haven't been elected president, sir.<eos> Yeah, but the presidency won't matter once the party turns its back on you, will it?<eos> When Bob Birch puts all the rest of your sheep in line, you'll be begging to come in from the cold.<eos> And two years from now, you'll be back in Phoenix replaying this very moment over and over again in your mind and realizing it was the beginning of the end.<eos> Patricia Whittaker and the Democratic Party will wipe their hands of you.
The committee?<eos> That's done.<eos> You see, you've already put out, Alex, and Will Conway is not taking you to the prom.<eos> My conversations with the governor and any position that I may or may not have...<eos> Oh, listen to yourself. Do you even believe you?
This is Lord Uhtred, who has sent a good many Dane to the place where you live.<eos> I do not live.<eos> You have a message for Lord Uhtred.<eos> Lord Uhtred.<eos> I see you now.
I think I like boys too much to be a top-notch nun.<eos> Yes, I think you made that clear by inviting him for a naked swim.<eos> Morning, Theo.<eos> On a brighter note, I've mended the magenpies' cage.<eos> I will never forgive you.
You know, it's too bad that you weren't a real Nightblood because then you could have been Commander.<eos> Imagine how many people you could've killed then.<eos> Tell me something, after you murder Emori, am I next?<eos> Ok!<eos> I'm begging you, please.
Maybe I'm both.<eos> Who knows?<eos> Did I ever tell you about how I got my first job at the White House?<eos> Harvard Lampoon connection.<eos> I told you?
Tom, I look like a mannequin.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> You look beautiful.<eos> Tom, I'm just no good at playing this, you know, submissive-wife role.<eos> - No one's asking you to.
Here you go.<eos> Come on.<eos> That's public record.<eos> I'm just trying to find out what happened next.<eos> Why'd they fire you?
What have you got?<eos> The FBI has her in custody.<eos> I want to talk to her as soon as possible.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I already told you...
That was different.<eos> I ain't rowing to Connecticut to trade with skinners.<eos> Hey, hey, friend, look.<eos> Now, I bet you get that dimber there for a pair of farthings.<eos> Told you, I got a woman.
You'd do this for your brother?<eos> Please.<eos> He suffers so.<eos> I am indeed a demon, but my curse is my own. I have no gift, dark or light, to give.<eos> I beseech you. Visit my brother, if only to confirm his belief in the fantastic.
We dated for two months... two months<eos> - when I was 19 years old.<eos> - You've been spending three nights a week at rehearsal till 11:00 - at night with this guy... - Shh.<eos> and you think that I didn't deserve to know that you had history with him?<eos> That's exactly why I didn't tell you.
And I know that he loved me.<eos> I'm so glad.<eos> I love you, Mom.<eos> I love you more.<eos> I love you m... no, no, I mean, I meant what I said, but I'm a grown-ass man and this is gonna cross a very weird line.
David, are you with me?<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm here.<eos> It wasn't you at the hospital.<eos> Yeah, I told you.
- From what?<eos> Look, I know you think you owe Vic from helping you out back in the Army, but what if you get this guy on the force and he loses his cool on someone?<eos> You really want to put your ass on the line for somebody you used to know?<eos> Hey.<eos> I'm telling you.
You're not going in.<eos> Great.<eos> Please, stand down.<eos> You've been given a lawful order.<eos> If DCI Huntley doesn't put you on paper, I will.
Mr Huntley, please don't make this any harder than it is already.<eos> - Hands behind your back.<eos> - She's lying!<eos> She's lying!<eos> Sir, please just calm down and let us take you to the station.
Dr. Frankenstein's is a... It's the result of... extended isolation.<eos> - They can't hurt me.<eos> - Who?<eos> What do you see?<eos> I warned you.
We have same place.<eos> Ice Cream Gulag.<eos> There, you go in, it's so cold, you die.<eos> I like you like this.<eos> I like you more than I usually like you.
Know what, why don't you come down to the gym and see it for yourself?<eos> Come on down to that worthless property that you can't even get insured, because, hey, it's on a fault line.<eos> Another wise decision.<eos> Consider it a loan.<eos> Cut me a check and I'll pay you back.
Are you a friend of Kyle's?<eos> I know most of his friends.<eos> He saved my life... he and the reverend.<eos> I would not be standing here today if it wasn't for them.<eos> They, what... pulled you out of a burning building or something?
I love you.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey, Chief.<eos> Mr. Giles.<eos> I'm supposed to take you down to the station.
Threaten her?<eos> Lock her up down at the junkyard?<eos> Now where would you hear something like that?<eos> Chief Nunez.<eos> She told me to bring you in.
You just never...<eos> No.<eos> She send you to collect me?<eos> No, sir.<eos> Was that really the Devil? That took you out there at the school?
Do I?<eos> The marriage and life you left behind, you did all that in the name of purpose.<eos> You weren't made for anything else,<eos> - certainly not to be a mother.<eos> - I warned you.
Oh, please.<eos> Mr. Snyder, tell me you did not come here angling to return to your former post.<eos> Oh, I've had many posts in my career.<eos> "Proxy Governor, Los Angeles" is not one I care to return to.<eos> So the Governor-General sent you here because she wants Alcala removed?
Something is happening.<eos> What is your location?<eos> House two-four-zero.<eos> All right, Mr. Ambassador.<eos> Stay with me. I'll get you through this.
You must be sabine's father.<eos> I've heard so much about you.<eos> Horrible things, I'm sure.<eos> Of course not.<eos> She loves you very much.
I'm not a tough... a tough person.<eos> You can ask anybody.<eos> So this, you, the leeches...<eos> I mean, if I get a paper cut, I have to lay down.<eos> So if I knew, I would tell you.
Thank you for the rain check.<eos> Actually, uh... I don't, uh, want a rain check.<eos> I mean... I do.<eos> Obviously, I do, but... I don't.<eos> You know how I told you that deposition was terrifying?
Then you're fine.<eos> It's captain's law.<eos> "Come aboard," right?<eos> And have the thing sit down.<eos> Other boats going by are looking at you, like, "Is that a gorilla?"
So what did you do, Padre?<eos> Get too friendly with one of your parishioners?<eos> Embezzle money from the church?<eos> My conscience is clear.<eos> That won't help you in court.
Look, Father, I know you wouldn't kill anybody and so does the inspector, he's just being too pig-headed to admit it.<eos> Is there anything I can do to help?<eos> That's very kind of you, Sergeant.<eos> But I wouldn't want to get you into trouble.<eos> And when has a bit of trouble ever stopped you from helping others?
An excuse that sounds as weak now as it did then.<eos> There's nothing weak about wanting to protect you.<eos> I was outside smoking a cigarette.<eos> I heard a scream, I came running, like everyone else.<eos> And yet, no-one saw you.
I don't believe that's the truth.<eos> You still love him.<eos> It's a purely professional relationship now.<eos> That's not what I saw.<eos> Father, I didn't invite you to investigate my personal life.
The miniature newspaper, sir.<eos> Where is it?<eos> How should I know?<eos> Arms, please.<eos> I've obliged you far enough.
You can count on the full support of the US Attorney's Office.<eos> And me, personally, I consider this a huge priority.<eos> And me, personally, I consider this a huge priority.<eos> You're a sharp guy.<eos> It's a shame you let the Bureau keep you in the basement for so long.
And what about Weller?<eos> That stays.<eos> He's still crucial to the end game.<eos> When were you gonna tell me about this?<eos> I'm telling you now.
I'm not gonna hurt you.<eos> In fact, I like you.<eos> I mean, that's the whole "you know" of it all is I liked you from the second I opened that door.<eos> So...<eos> I'm gonna make it easy on you.
Murphy, um, can you go make sure that Mindy is set up in the scanner?<eos> You're not welcome on my case.<eos> I'm not actually asking.<eos> It's my job.<eos> Well, I'm actually telling you.
You keep referring to the plaintiff as "Toby."<eos> Do you know Toby?<eos> Are you friends?<eos> Should I ask Mr. Boseman if he wants to answer that question?<eos> Okay, let me ask you again.
Please, sit down.<eos> Why, didn't you give your name?<eos> Well, I was worried you wouldn't want me as a client.<eos> I wanted to get a chance to argue my case.<eos> That's crazy. Why wouldn't I want you as a client?
No, Your Honor, but I would like an answer to my question.<eos> Mr. AUSA?<eos> Would you like to lean in so you could hear me clearly?<eos> I can hear you just fine.<eos> I'd like His Honor to hear you.
Come get this. Come get this!<eos> How that college search coming?<eos> All-consuming.<eos> Twins, you know.<eos> Yeah, I hear you.
- No.<eos> Why would they keep one egg hidden?<eos> Patient confidentiality?<eos> Do any of the Poly-Tech researchers see patients?<eos> I can't tell you.
You've been reinstated.<eos> I don't accept your reinstatement.<eos> You're a clown.<eos> What's worse is you're a smart clown who occasionally has a point, a point you destroy by mixing it up with racism and misogyny you probably don't even believe.<eos> When you were little, someone rejected you or made fun of you, and now you get to be one of the mean guys, making fun of others.
Earth's last hope, Josh. -Oh.<eos> So now you believe in me.<eos> I never didn't believe in you.<eos> I put you in front of the president because what you had to say was important.<eos> I risked my career for you, and you paid me back by walking out.
But I got to do it or it's gonna get infected.<eos> - Ah. - Sorry.<eos> Mac, I never got a chance to tell you that I'm sorry.<eos> I never meant for you to get hurt.<eos> I wanted to tell you.
And right now, all I see is you possibly destroying valuable evidence.<eos> Okay. Um...<eos> Every step we take leaves a little bit of dust behind from all the places we've been before.<eos> It's hard to see on a dirty floor, but with a little bit of Mylar and a static charge... You can see the killer's footprint.<eos> Ha. See, I told you.
It's not going in right.<eos> It will.<eos> Just untwist it and try again.<eos> You have that needle inserted into his brain...<eos> - I told you.
I would like a few moments alone so I can pray.<eos> Then we should begin.<eos> I believe in you.<eos> In the name of the Father, of the son, and of the Holy Spirit, amen.<eos> Be with me now, in this hour of need, I pray to you.
He filled your mind with lies about me, about things that I've done.<eos> Is that why you killed him?<eos> Oh, sweetheart.<eos> I didn't kill your brother.<eos> I've told you so many times.
Like you don't know?<eos> I'm sorry about Adam.<eos> I just keep making the same mistake.<eos> I keep forgetting how much this place sucks.<eos> It just wrecks you.
What brings you to 1970?<eos> - Oh, well, I supposed Nate should probably tell you.<eos> - Nathaniel's here too?<eos> Sir?<eos> They say they know you.
That's not real life though, is it?<eos> It wasn't just once.<eos> It was every day.<eos> He was... touching me and...<eos> You know you want to. I think about you...
They call you Uncle Tom.<eos> They smile and they shake your hand and then they laugh at you behind your back.<eos> You think I don't know that?<eos> You think I don't see that every day?<eos> You can respect an institution that treats you like that?
I'm returning to Winchester with an important message for Alfred.<eos> We're going to see Alfred.<eos> Climb onto the cart.<eos> You can help guard Mercia's ransom.<eos> God bless you, Lord, saviour of my blistered feet.
His own daughter is operating right under his nose?<eos> I tried to tell him. He just... he won't listen.<eos> Wait, you told him about the operation, about the AIC?<eos> Ryan told him. He didn't tell you?<eos> They didn't tell you.
Yeah, like the time you offered me petrol money for that league game in Otley!<eos> That was based on mileage as the crow flies, divided by the four of us. ¬£2!<eos> It was mathematically sound!<eos> Yeah, all in coppers!<eos> Right, shall I split you four ways?
Oh, Archie, I'm so sorry.<eos> Thanks, Kevin.<eos> That is why I wanted to pay this meal.<eos> Sorry, Malcolm.<eos> I should have told you sooner.
Only because he moved the body.<eos> You still think it's in that closet we searched?<eos> Between the vacuum and the Christmas ornaments?<eos> You don't believe me?<eos> Fine. Ask her, she'll tell you.
Maybe I was 16, 17.<eos> That ID cost me every penny I had, but it was worth it for him not to find me.<eos> What did you mean when you said he killed more than my mom?<eos> I think he's the Nightingale killer, and that's why it is so important you tell me what happened to her.<eos> I... I told you.
Remember, none of this is your fault, buddy.<eos> But you and Macy are persons of interest in this case because Macy was having an affair with Jamie.<eos> Of course.<eos> I wondered why you wanted to talk to me.<eos> Did Macy not tell you?
About beggars not being choosy.<eos> Damn. There it is!<eos> That's the look I wanted to see, the mad Blaine!<eos> Priceless.<eos> Didn't I tell you?
- Thanks.<eos> - Do you want to take a seat?<eos> - No, you're all right, thanks.<eos> Yeah, so can I ask how you heard about us?<eos> My wife heard you on the radio, whenever that was.
You have a self-destructive streak, Agent Beeman.<eos> I'm telling you because I went behind my boss's back before--<eos> And you didn't feel good about it.<eos> Thank you for informing me.<eos> No, I'm telling you in case you want to be there.
Oh! If everybody need to look skinny like you for job, nobody have job.<eos> Ah, ah, ah!<eos> How's Pasha?<eos> Ah. Some days better, some days worse...<eos> All I know... thank you God for Tuan.
Okay.<eos> Um... I have a favor to ask.<eos> Please.<eos> But I don't know if this is something you can help me.<eos> We can't tell you unless you ask.
Can you blame him?<eos> I mean how is he supposed to let Jessica go when, thanks to you, everyday, he has to come to work and stare at a damn machine that can go back in time and bring his wife back to life?<eos> I thought we were a team...<eos> he should've just come to me.<eos> The way that I came to you about Amy?
You steal a man's idea, rendering his company worthless.<eos> I've read a number of disparaging articles about your generation<eos> It's all true.<eos> Fuck you!<eos> Professor Bighetti, I'll see you at home.
But I chose not to kill him.<eos> The other body, who is it?<eos> A Castor.<eos> Tell me Helena's location, and this all goes away.<eos> Even if I knew where she was, I wouldn't tell you.
Get rid of them.<eos> Just let us go!<eos> You got what you came for.<eos> You'll never see us again.<eos> I'm begging you.
Are these...?<eos> Are these for real?<eos> Mount Pleasant's police chief thinks he was killed two nights ago.<eos> You'll be meeting her shortly.<eos> Because you reside in New York, she requested that the NYPD pick you up, and gave us permission to talk to you.
- I'm gonna take a number.<eos> - Please, sir.<eos> Um, you know what, I'm gonna take a couple of numbers, just in case I don't-- I don't hear the first number.<eos> Yeah, wow, you guys got a lot of numbers.<eos> Mr. Corrigan, I beseech you.
Jesus, Colt.<eos> No.<eos> Abby, I didn't... I didn't cheat on you.<eos> It was the time that you knew about. I...<eos> I would have told you earlier, but...
She's got a bread pillow.<eos> I just think everything with her parents and the baby and you guys hit her all at once.<eos> Shit.<eos> This is all my fault.<eos> - You waiting' for me to argue with you? - I just...
You're gonna have to hold him.<eos> Bourbon, old-fashioned.<eos> Uh, well, sir, uh, I was wondering if you wouldn't mind explaining to us something I've always wanted to know about policy.<eos> Ah, there's Felix right there.<eos> Best to you both.
Yeah, well, we don't want to impose.<eos> I mean, you know what they say:<eos> multiples of two is company, and multiples of three is a crowd.<eos> But we don't want you to go.<eos> Let me rephrase that, I'm begging you not to go.
Both of you.<eos> I would never have kissed him if I didn't think that you were dead.<eos> Come now, Wynonna, we never lied to each other.<eos> You are free to kiss whoever you like.<eos> As long as they want you too.
Because their leaders tell them they should be.<eos> But since 9/11, 180,000 people have died from gun violence in this country, only 94 have been killed by Muslim terrorists.<eos> That is what I would call a perceived issue.<eos> I won't apologize for being passionate.<eos> Nor would I ask you to.
The woman is an arsonist.<eos> She's not gonna stop until she burns me to the ground.<eos> - I'm unarmed.<eos> - Who is here? !<eos> Your patient, the person Kaplan hired you to work on.
Chicago PD.<eos> I'll take that.<eos> These days, a stranger shows up at my door, I grab a bat.<eos> Mm-hmm, is that because of the Perv Hunters?<eos> Can you describe the men who ambushed you?
He had a family emergency.<eos> He told me that I could see him any time.<eos> He promised.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> But I can have one of his residents see you.
So are we, Lindsey.<eos> Whoa, whoa. It's ok.<eos> There it is.<eos> If this is a trick, I'm going to kill all of us.<eos> I swear to you it's not a trick.
Welcome to Mexico!<eos> Ready to fly to Tecate?<eos> Let me remind you that you only have 36 hours left.<eos> I'll have time to spare, son of a bitch.<eos> Conrado, the Party Leader wants to see you.
I am really happy to hear that.<eos> I was thinking this conversation was gonna go a lot differently.<eos> No, no.<eos> It was an honest mistake.<eos> I mean, if I had known you were a cop, I never would've treated you that way.
I don't know what to say.<eos> George and I have been in a relationship for two years.<eos> Raymond doesn't know.<eos> Please don't tell him.<eos> I'm asking you as a friend.
I know. (gasps)<eos> Look, Bobby, there it is.<eos> Winthorpe Manor.<eos> BOB: That is... wow.<eos> I'm telling you, Bobby, this is the life I was supposed to have.
It's, um...<eos> He doesn't like displays of affection.<eos> Well, and I bet we could get him out of here faster.<eos> Not yet.<eos> I told you.
I should've spoke up." I hope there's discussions like that, not just between friends in high schools and colleges when this show airs, but between parents.<eos> You have nothing more to tell me... about bullying at school?<eos> No.<eos> Or, um... Hannah Baker?<eos> Look, I told you, Mom... I didn't really know her.
It does.<eos> All the little intricate parts.<eos> Like, I was in an e-mail fight recently.<eos> You ever been in an e-mail fight?<eos> Some of you are in an e-mail fight right now.
I couldn't believe it, and I just said to him, you know,<eos> "This is amazing.<eos> This is, like, taking it to the next level.<eos> Like, you're going to be nominated for this,<eos> I'm telling you right now,"
You think you're selling Devon on a good deal?<eos> You're just too young and too ignorant to see what he's buying.<eos> It's not your mind he's after, Teresa.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Don't let your ego tell you otherwise.
Stop?<eos> No, no, ladies, I'm just getting started.<eos> See, you charge me, I have a constitutional right to present a defense, and I promise you that immunity deal will be Exhibit A.<eos> I wouldn't celebrate.<eos> We're not charging you, but we're not exactly letting you go either.
Whatever it is, if it's not about locating Reddington--<eos> - It's not, but...<eos> - Then it'll have to wait.<eos> Sir, I've been subpoenaed to testify in front of a grand jury.<eos> I'm not supposed to tell you because you're a target of the investigation.
When they said they were gonna revoke my immunity agreement if I didn't cooperate, they threatened me, so I gave you up.<eos> I'm sorry, you what?<eos> When I testified for the grand jur...<eos> Hang on. Didn't...<eos> Didn't Samar tell you?
I didn't violate our agreement. You did.<eos> I promised to make your problem go away and I did that.<eos> I played a card that I can never play again with the U.S. Attorney's office, but you and Atticus Finch decided to go to trial anyway.<eos> Don't you just hate people with integrity?<eos> - No, but right now I really hate you.
Last couple months, I've been working as an investigator for a firm called Sawyer Winthrop Rose.<eos> They're divorce lawyers.<eos> Ardy helped me get the gig.<eos> So between 6:00 and 8:00 last night, I was parked outside the Birchwood Grove Country Club on the Island, tailing a client's husband.<eos> Anyone see you?
You have a number in mind?<eos> I do.<eos> Detective Bell.<eos> Sorry, there must have been some mix-up.<eos> I told Janine to bring you to my office.
Roy's safe deposit box also had a hundred grand in cash in it.<eos> Now, you're licensed to practice law in both New York and New Jersey.<eos> When you took the bar in Jersey, you had to give your fingerprints.<eos> They matched prints we found all over the cash.<eos> Roy discovered what you were doing and shook you down.
Hold it right there.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> It's a, it's a toy.<eos> Armed with a paintball gun and wearing a body camera, just like our victim.<eos> Dr. Eriyo, we've been expecting you.
No, I'm sorry.<eos> That... weirdness in Waverly you were trying to... yeah,<eos> I'm kind of finally noticing now.<eos> I can't betray her trust.<eos> I... I would never ask you to.
We're like a needle in a haystack.<eos> I'll take it one step further.<eos> The needle is hay-colored.<eos> And the haystack is made of needles.<eos> I'm telling you, there is no way that Pat could ever find us.
Stop here till we get this sorted, will you?<eos> Please.<eos> Shabir Ahmed?<eos> Yes.<eos> We're arresting you on suspicion of rape.
- And we need it pronto!<eos> - Come on, you!<eos> Whoa-whoa-whoa! My quarrel's with Mr. Holliday,<eos> - you can go. - I wish I could, but, you know, I can't.<eos> Whatever they are paying you, I'll pay double.
She hadn't deteriorated.<eos> No maggots or anything like that.<eos> I just wanna say goodbye to you and thank you for your help today.<eos> Oh, okay. No problem.<eos> We're really sorry we dragged you all over tarnation.
Hello.<eos> Brian?<eos> Who's this?<eos> My name's Alan Horn.<eos> You don't know me, but your mother suggested that I call you.
Her.<eos> And what happened to her.<eos> I'm telling you the same thing I told them.<eos> I don't have the slightest idea.<eos> Do you remember why they visited you?
I tried him back.<eos> Yeah. I mean, maybe let me call.<eos> Hi, is this Pete McKeon?<eos> Is this Pete McKeon?<eos> Hi, Pete, I don't think I've ever met you, um, and, um...
I'm Cathy's sister.<eos> Right, right.<eos> I'm her little sister.<eos> I'm her younger sister.<eos> I know that Russell had called you when Cathy went missing... and that you had come there that night with Gerry.
Harvey said as much when he offered your services.<eos> - And why'd you turn him down?<eos> - Because... there are things about this situation that I'd rather not share with Harvey.<eos> - I can understand that completely, and whatever they are, if I were your attorney, there is no way in hell that he would hear them from me.<eos> That I can assure you.
- All right, what do you wanna know?<eos> - Let's start with who's telling you to pick fights with guys who are about to get out.<eos> - Nobody ever told me to pick a fight with anybody.<eos> All I know is new guy comes into the block, I'm supposed to teach him a lesson.<eos> - Well, how do you know that if nobody ever told you?
- Look, Nathan, I had to...<eos> - Mike, come on, relax.<eos> I'm not angry.<eos> Though I do wish I had a picture of your face right now.<eos> - What tipped you off? - Come on, are you kidding me?
This is just a routine check of our security procedures.<eos> What protocols did you complete prior to the release of that enriched uranium?<eos> Every single one of them, sir.<eos> Ms. Barrows had the proper access code.<eos> Then I called you to personally verify authorization.
Perfect!<eos> And let me say something, I am like, Raven-Symon√© level upset that you did not get that job.<eos> George, That is so Raven of you to say.<eos> It's not raving', it's true.<eos> You, Gil Faizon, how many times have I told you? You are the strongest actor in New York?
We just need the signature of the frontman.<eos> Find me more investment opportunities here, Lora.<eos> I want to make this city mine.<eos> Boss.<eos> The Director of the Judicial Police is waiting for you.
But that was a double set-up.<eos> I thought the norte√±os were coming after you.<eos> Fucking, To√±o, I'm building you an altar!<eos> You'd better build a tomb for Chino first.<eos> He was the one who handed you over to Ram√≥n.
I was going. I am.<eos> I will.<eos> Have you two been having trouble?<eos> Nope.<eos> Something's keeping you.
We have no defenses, so of course Dracula's bastards come over the wall every night.<eos> The bishop will sort things out.<eos> This city has, not to put too fine a point on it, gone to hell.<eos> If the others will just do as he says when he tells us to do it, then all will be in order.<eos> I warned you.
"Because I love novels."<eos> If that's the case, then why don't you just write a diary.<eos> Mr. Michima, don't underestimate the power of expression.<eos> Isn't that why your novels never sold?<eos> They're only selling now because of the scandals surrounding you.
Yeah. Yeah.<eos> Right?<eos> I think it's a good idea.<eos> See?<eos> I told you, man.
When someone dies in front of you, the way Claire died, it's like you're whole world just snaps into focus.<eos> - Cry for help? - It was a way to pass the time.<eos> Don't pretend you know what I am.<eos> You're wrong, I do know you.<eos> I know you from this.
Say you loved somebody.<eos> But she got sick.<eos> And then someone came along one day to pull the plug on her to take her away from you forever.<eos> What would you do?<eos> - I just wanna get you outta here.
Just how good can his kingdom be?<eos> You think that's funny?<eos> No, not that.<eos> What's funny is that you've lost your sling ring.<eos> Sir, can I help you?
Thank you.<eos> I will, of course, need to hear Mr. Murray's conditions.<eos> On the day that I agreed to join you on your mission and allowed your star to enter my sphere, your wife was present to witness your ascent.<eos> My only condition is that she again be present to witness your acknowledgment of the wrongs... that you have done to me.<eos> Mr. Murray. The last time I saw you, I was putting you on the only remaining horse, giving you far more than your share of our food.
- Where'd it go? Where'd it go?<eos> - There!<eos> What just happened?<eos> Abby, what just happened?<eos> I'll tell you what just happened.
We started telling ghost stories, and we just kind of bonded right away.<eos> And all the other kids were, you know, getting drunk and going to parties, and we're like, "That's stupid."<eos> Plus, we weren't invited to any parties.<eos> You know what? You know what I thought...<eos> I'm not gonna tell you.
Okay, ladies, let's gear up and hit that Mercado.<eos> Who's in the mood to save New York City?<eos> And did you try adjusting the thermostat before placing this call?<eos> Well, I'm terribly sorry that you have a draft in your room.<eos> Why don't you hold while I connect you to someone who might care.
That's a non-answer.<eos> What's a non-answer?<eos> Wouldn't you like to know?<eos> You want to know what I think? No.<eos> I'm gonna tell you.
Rooms filled with cash.<eos> - S√≠, something like that.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah. - Sounds good, man.<eos> - May God bless you with that problem.
We do this for our customers who handle special clients.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Yes, I think I do.<eos> At BCCI, we're a full-service bank.<eos> Mr. Bilgrami, as long as I have you on the phone, I wonder if you can help me.
You, me and every other prick is sucking on the tit of that golden calf.<eos> Now listen to me.<eos> If one of those bullets was meant for you, I wouldn't be talking to you now, would I?<eos> Look, Dominic, I...<eos> - Who sent you, Ospina?
- Joshua Baron.<eos> What is your name, sir?<eos> Your name?<eos> Robert Musella.<eos> Eshu Elegu√° is protecting you today.
Is there a problem?<eos> No, I've just never seen quite so many stars align at the fate line.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - It's more than okay.<eos> It means destiny has marked you for success.
"that the President has sanctioned?<eos> "'Cause, my friend Bob's getting really upset?"<eos> Reagan wants Noriega's ass. Are you listening to me?<eos> Hey, hey. You know what Alcaino said?<eos> "That's not an answer that keeps you alive, my friend."
I'm home.<eos> Don Pablo is not happy.<eos> 10 million of Don Chepe's money, which is Escobar's money, is stuck in Panama.<eos> It seems your President Reagan, he's frozen all Panamanian accounts in an effort...<eos> That is not an answer that keeps you alive.
Fun. Friends. My friends.<eos> That's right, Jim.<eos> The I.D. band on your wrist is your key to the wonders of the Avalon.<eos> You're in perfect health, Jim.<eos> Let's get you to your cabin where you can get some rest.
You made an enemy.<eos> Now, even if I knew something, I wouldn't tell you, kid.<eos> And you know why I wouldn't tell you?<eos> And this is... It's not my only reason, but it is a principle reason.<eos> You know, I wouldn't tell you 'cause you're a fucking moron.
Still... I'll take them.<eos> You've come to visit the general? Yes.<eos> Your name?<eos> Colonel Lebedev is my name.<eos> I can't find you here for some reason.
What?<eos> Shall we go?<eos> Hello.<eos> Good afternoon.<eos> How can I help you?
Lighter than Jones, heavier than Gregson.<eos> I, I just came up... Mrs. Hudson didn't seem to be talking.<eos> I fear she has branched into literary criticism by means of satire.<eos> It is a distressing trend in the modern landlady.<eos> What brings you here in your off-duty hours?
Yeah, of course, just to wish you the compliments of the season.<eos> Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas.<eos> Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas.<eos> Thank God that's over.<eos> Now, Inspector, what strange happening compels you to my door, but embarrasses you to relate?
Good luck.<eos> Well, sit down, Mr. rose.<eos> I can give you five minutes.<eos> That's all I need, miss law.<eos> I'm only seeing you because my colleague tells me that you interviewed him once on some horrid little provincial rag.
Yeah, what time is it, seriously?<eos> It's 3:30 am, it's time to jog.<eos> - I've school in three hours.<eos> - Wake up, dude.<eos> I'm not gonna ask you again.
Only you can do that.<eos> - So?<eos> - Are you married?<eos> I'm divorced. Is there anything else you want to know?<eos> - She left you?
And I wasn't all that comfortable with the attention myself.<eos> Well, try living under a fucking microscope today.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You know?<eos> They will eat you alive.
I like our house.<eos> One with a big backyard.<eos> Take you shopping.<eos> Thank you for calling Millennium Realty.<eos> How can I help you?
Yes, I wanted to cal! And let you know that in the next few months about a dozen houses in your neighborhood are gonna be foreclosed.<eos> And once the bank forecloses those houses, the overall property value for the block goes down.<eos> Pretty soon what you had, what you have now, isn't worth much.<eos> Split it between these.<eos> So, I'm calling you today with an offer.
- I can't help you.<eos> Is this about the case in Indonesia ten years ago?<eos> - I need to go.<eos> - Father, it wasn't your fault.<eos> The Vatican cleared you.
You need to tell a teacher, that's what.<eos> No, they would call me snitch.<eos> What, who cares if some punk calls you a snitch?<eos> Why didn't you at least tell me?<eos> I'm telling you now.
It's all right.<eos> Means a lot, and, Bruce, I couldn't have done it without you, truly.<eos> So, thank you.<eos> Some of you know my story.<eos> Not all of you do.
If I lose power, it might still happen.<eos> Your American friends wouldn't like that.<eos> Okay, I will send you 1,000 of our best former legionnaires.<eos> The mining companies will hire them as security officers, but you will give the orders.<eos> Katanga thanks you for that.
To protect the interest of the mines.<eos> Plus Paris is freezing this time of year.<eos> To Paris.<eos> To Paris.<eos> These people you're here to protect... are you sure they want you?
Listen.<eos> You can't say a word of this to the others.<eos> Look at this place.<eos> And to think, the entire universe, it all started with the Big Bang.<eos> Yeah, Beebs? Well, I got a "Big Bang" for you.
- Okay, I got it.<eos> - Go away, go away.<eos> - He is the local doctor.<eos> - You should be on time.<eos> If something happens to my daughter, I'll kill you!
We are keeping it hidden.<eos> But believe me, if we could...<eos> One day...<eos> I will tell you the reason.<eos> I vow to you.
How is it you find yourself there?<eos> They say a burglary.<eos> I say trespassing.<eos> I didn't leave with nothing.<eos> Isn't that because the police apprehended you before you could get out the door with the Fujitsu TV you were carrying?
No.<eos> Why not, if it was possible she was still alive?<eos> I wasn't thinking.<eos> You see why I'm having some trouble here?<eos> You had the presence of mind to run from a crime scene, to remove evidence implicating you in the crime, to operate a motor vehicle without crashing into anything, but you didn't have the presence of mind to dial three numbers on your phone?
Even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart.<eos> And if thy poor devoted servant may But beg one favour at thy gracious hand, Thou dost confirm his happiness for ever.<eos> That it may please you, presently repair to Westminster.<eos> I will with all expedient duty see you there.<eos> I beseech you, come.
For first he was contract to Lady Bona.<eos> This Elizabeth, a poor widow, Seduc'd the pitch and height of his degree To base declension and loath'd bigamy.<eos> By her, in his unlawful bed, he got This little Edward, whom we call a Prince.<eos> Then, good my lord, take to your royal self This proffer'd benefit of dignity.<eos> Do, my good lord: Your citizens entreat you.
Right away, Mr. Dawes.<eos> Nothing for me.<eos> Strange times, indeed.<eos> Call it a conflict of interest.<eos> Whatever gets you through the day, beratna.
And that makes me a monster.<eos> There was no scrip to bury her, so I laid her to rest in a beautiful bauxite tunnel that we discovered together.<eos> Do you know it is possible to cry so hard that your tears turn to blood?<eos> And living with this pain, I came to realize that I have millions of brothers and sisters in the Belt.<eos> I even count you among them.
Hey, listen, I gotta go.<eos> But watch your chute, I hear things are funny these days on Ceres.<eos> Catch you.<eos> The property line is that way.<eos> I would tell you if I could.
7:00 A.M.<eos> Nutting.<eos> Welcome to the free hostel.<eos> It's Todd.<eos> Yeah, I recognized you from the denim pajama pants.
I don't know how I did it.<eos> I mean, that was awesome.<eos> And I gotta tell you, seeing your face now. It is busted.<eos> Honestly, that makeup was not that bad.<eos> Well, thank you for today and we will catch you later.
Really?<eos> I only need to talk about suitable things And she will not wear undergarments as she knocks on my bedroom door.<eos> We think very much alike.<eos> And who is that?<eos> That very same person will reject you.
He knew that.<eos> He said black hated him.<eos> Can I ask y'all something?<eos> Please do.<eos> What did Kendu Wallace ever do to you?
Mild Traumatic Brain Injury..<eos> It usually happens after an accident. So, where are you from?<eos> France, Paris.<eos> Doctor, who got me here?<eos> A chauffeur.. a cabbie found you.. somewhere near a church..
And all alone..<eos> You are not alone..<eos> No Kaavya, I don't want to drag you into all this.<eos> Not at all!<eos> Do I still need to tell you..
We can show you, if you want.<eos> - Ms. Schnuck, come.<eos> - Come in.<eos> She's my sister.<eos> She will explain to you.
Oh, God.<eos> Oh, shit, fuck.<eos> Oh, you know, it doesn't really make any difference because I'm willin' to alter those things because I believe in redemption, right?<eos> And I'm willin' to do that.<eos> I warned you, Dog.
Anyone coming down here won't be with good intentions.<eos> Though I'd say everyone's laying low, probably riding this out tonight.<eos> Tonight, but give it a day or two. We've got what they want.<eos> Well, Charlie, thank you again for letting us stay with you.<eos> Let Sam take you down to your house to get what you and your family need.
You're going to be all right.<eos> Come on.<eos> You all right?<eos> I have three missing bodies to find.<eos> If you know anything about them, I'd advise you to say so now.
- You know me.<eos> - So you two are... together?<eos> That part's complicated.<eos> You guys get that.<eos> We love you, but Sigmund Freud on an ounce of coke couldn't understand you and The Droid.
- That was fast.<eos> - It's all right.<eos> Here you go.<eos> I come bearing gifts.<eos> Don't worry. I won't put you on YouTube.
Lose all their guilty stains<eos> Lord of Air, Lord of Earth, we ask that you receive this child into your loving arms.<eos> We are sinners.<eos> Let us release.<eos> Caleb, our leader, I invite you, sir, to lead us in this Purging as you have and as you will.
I shall go and break the news to her at Sully point.<eos> I'm coming with you.<eos> Good of you, Walker, but I think I should go alone.<eos> Meet me at the church hall in an hour, and we shall discuss a guard rota for the traitor Wilson.<eos> Dolly dear, what did you mean it was staring you in the face?
- And you?<eos> - Fine, very well.<eos> I have two memories of my senior year. The hospital where my mom and I waited as my dad died.<eos> And your class, where I discovered philosophy.<eos> I had to tell you.
You?<eos> You know, I live here.<eos> The people vs. Nasir Khan, indictment number 4157 OF 2014.<eos> Arraign the defendant.<eos> The grand jury of the state of New York has indicted you for the crimes of possession of a weapon for deadly purpose, resisting arrest, aggravated sexual assault in the first degree, and murder in the first degree.
Yeah.<eos> - I need a towel.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Thank you for today, baby.
- Vern, shh.<eos> - She was tending...<eos> She's on their side.<eos> Look at that.<eos> I told you, she's escaping.
I did wonder -- might it be possible for you to... .."polish" me a little?<eos> Just a touch of powder, something around the eyes, perhaps. Nothing dramatic.<eos> Phyllis, you look quite magnificent.<eos> I'm sure I don't know why.<eos> Mind you, this is a new cardigan.
That's supposed to be a phone number, and it's not.<eos> You need to translate this right now.<eos> Did you get these?<eos> Destroy those.<eos> Listen, listen! I'm having trouble hearing you, but our sources are checking every hospital.
Aye, Clan Fraser, perhaps.<eos> But the MacDonalds will get the job done.<eos> Aye, and the Camerons.<eos> With all due respect, why fight at all?<eos> I implore you, Your Royal Highness, walk the camp.
I knew he needed help, but at the time I felt I did all I could do, and I have... regretted feeling that way ever since.<eos> - Sorry I pressed.<eos> - You did.<eos> But don't be sorry.<eos> And don't act like you did it for the guys 'cause... you did it to keep me from pressing you.
He probably got a lead, and went to go and check it out.<eos> Alone.<eos> Without pulling you in on a single detail.<eos> Are you sure you don't know where to find him?<eos> If I knew, I would tell you.
You a shrink?<eos> I was on the job for 15 years.<eos> I left to become a psychologist.<eos> I'm with the peer assistance program. I'm a volunteer.<eos> Well, how about I volunteer my way out of this chair, tell you to kiss my ass, and talk to my union rep?
- All right.<eos> What is all this stuff?<eos> During the cover-up, I stole whatever I could.<eos> What cover-up?<eos> They couldn't advertise Rackham's death, or the explosion that supposedly killed you, or Reva's data dump, so they... they killed the whole thing.
He's my friend.<eos> And that's why you'll never see him again.<eos> Or this.<eos> You didn't say I would never see you again.<eos> Be thankful I'm not the one with the powers... because I'd kill you if you did half the shit that you did to him to me.
Who's your new sponsor?<eos> Is it Willis Stryker?<eos> Law... yer.<eos> You were part of a hostage situation, Hernan.<eos> Even if your lawyer does get you out... you won't be walking away from that.
Because sometimes you have to stand up for something bigger than yourself, even if it means getting your legs broken.<eos> But I'm guessing you already knew that.<eos> Now let's go kick some ass.<eos> Yes, I understand we're under siege, but if they can't hear me, I can't control them.<eos> Now get a security guard to take you down to the control room, and just fix the...
You know that can't happen, man.<eos> Oh, come on!<eos> Hey, Salome.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey, use a coaster. How many times do I gotta tell you?
- Hey, Lorena.<eos> Oh, this looks cool.<eos> Thanks. It's my vampire lair.<eos> I see that. What are you doing?<eos> I would tell you, but I fear the NSA will implicate you.
The love that surrounds all of us all the time.<eos> We bless these children together with our hands... that the love that flows through our hands...<eos> Well, hello, Reverend.<eos> I wasn't expecting to see you around these parts 'till Sunday.<eos> What brings you around the middle of the week?
I'm from the Department of Justice.<eos> I'm hereby serving you with the enclosed complaint...<eos> - Really? We have to do this in public?<eos> - Issued by the US government against Deep Dream Corporation for violation of the Sherman Act.<eos> This complaint requires you to preserve all personal and corporate financial records pending antitrust motions to be filed in federal court.
And this... is my bust.<eos> The game is Texas Hold 'em.<eos> Minimum bet... $10,000.<eos> Are you sure about this?<eos> I told you, I've never lost.
I kinda like it.<eos> I need to access safety deposit box 1121.<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> I need to access safety deposit box 1121.<eos> Wait, where do I know you from?
I'll rest soon enough.<eos> Well, I certainly hope you do not mind if I do.<eos> We have a long journey ahead.<eos> Shit.<eos> I warned you?
Mmm-hmm.<eos> Figured somebody might have killed you by now.<eos> Handsome animal.<eos> He ain't for sale, if that's what you're thinking.<eos> Somebody nearly did kill you, didn't they?
What kind of a crime?<eos> They're going to kill President Yevdokimova?<eos> Call your boss, Inspector Varis.<eos> She arrested me.<eos> Why did the Security Police arrest you?
On the night of June 12, 1994, were you in the company of Mr. Simpson?<eos> I...<eos> I respectfully decline to answer and assert my constitutional right to remain silent.<eos> Mr. Kaelin, you are a witness, not a suspect.<eos> You have no right to invoke the Fifth Amendment, so I am going to ask you again.
Or new yorker?<eos> New yorker.<eos> New yorker.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Alan dershowitz told me to look you up. Ah.
That's what I'm saying.<eos> My God.<eos> This is insane.<eos> Can he say the word "nigger" on TV?<eos> So then anyone who comes to this court and quotes you as using that word in dealing with African-Americans would be a liar. Would they not, Detective Fuhrman?
You might up missing around this motherfucker.<eos> Hey, shut the fuck up with all that loud ass shit.<eos> Who said that?<eos> Who the fuck said that?<eos> Tori, sit your whack white ass down before I put you down, bitch.
His Holiness the High Septon is welcome to see me here in the Red Keep.<eos> Your Grace, this is not a request.<eos> It is a request, Cousin Lancel.<eos> You are asking me for something, I'm refusing.<eos> The High Septon commands you.
I once walked into a brothel with a honeycomb and a jackass.<eos> The madam says--<eos> The Masters have come for their property.<eos> Lord Edmure.<eos> I apologize for the way the Freys treated you.
After you've massacred my family.<eos> Kept me in a cell for years.<eos> Stolen our lands.<eos> I'll remind you that our houses are at war.<eos> I'm sorry if this conflict has inconvenienced you, but rebelling against the Crown does have consequences.
But I didn't hate her.<eos> I admired her.<eos> Far more than her husband or her son.<eos> Do you think I care whom you admire and whom you don't?<eos> No, I don't, but I'm telling you anyway because you're my prisoner.
I serve the Lord of Light.<eos> I do what he commands.<eos> How do you know what he commands?<eos> I interpret his signs... as well as I can.<eos> If the Lord didn't want me to bring you back, how did I bring you back?
- You calling me stupid?<eos> I loved it because it was great to finally hang out with you.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> We're together constantly. We're roommates.<eos> Yep, told you.
The chicken again?<eos> The chicken is funny.<eos> A touch of comedy to balance the whole thing out.<eos> They're gonna be throwing money at you. I just know it.<eos> Uh, they'll throw something at you. I don't know.
- Yeah, you knew that.<eos> - No, I didn't! - Mm-hmm.<eos> - I never knew you guys...<eos> - I told you we slept together. - Had sex.<eos> - I told you.
Edmond.<eos> Mrs. d'Abrant√®s.<eos> I hear you're leading in the polls.<eos> Only an idiot would trust the polls.<eos> Sorry, Mr. d'Abrant√®s. I didn't see you there.
We've supported regeneration for years.<eos> We'll do what Shanghai did.<eos> Shanghai became the world's number one port by developing business centers that attracted investors from all over the world.<eos> That's our goal.<eos> Mr. Barr√®s, the Mayor has pretty much appointed you as his successor.
- Who does?<eos> Sang.<eos> He told me everything.<eos> He killed my father.<eos> So, this is what drives you?
The thing.<eos> How should I know?<eos> Find out for yourself.<eos> You find out for yourself.<eos> No one is gonna tell you.
Fortnight, God willing.<eos> Transport Minister, Vice Regent, Left Chancellor...<eos> The Khan's given you more titles than he has consorts in his harem.<eos> He honors me with lack of sleep.<eos> The Khan will see you now.
Precisely.<eos> How can the Khan of Mongolia oversee the affairs of his motherland when he now must govern all of China and outwards?<eos> It is a doomed prospect.<eos> This is what they will say.<eos> This is how they will challenge you.
You would call me "brother" now?<eos> The news was coming.<eos> The only question was who carried it.<eos> Better a stranger than to be stabbed by blood.<eos> I wish you well, brother, always.
Long passes!<eos> Keep playing, keep playing.<eos> Katende.<eos> They turned you down.<eos> I warned you.
Yes, sir.<eos> I must warn you, a man with integrity in a water company... is as rare as a white rhino.<eos> I need someone like you.<eos> Give me some time to find an opening.<eos> But we are going to get you in here.
No, I've got an appointment.<eos> My cousin, Boris Drubetskoy, he's in the Guards.<eos> Oh, very grand.<eos> Can you take care of the bill for...<eos> - I'll pay you back.
You have no reason not to buy it.<eos> Thank you.<eos> One hundred and fifty dollars.<eos> Tell me... how did you got this camera?<eos> I'm sorry, I can not tell you.
Oh, God, yes.<eos> Oh, God, baby.<eos> You a sick fuck, Gallagher!<eos> Get the hell out of my cemetery!<eos> I warned you!
I don't understand.<eos> Help me.<eos> - The Polish Red Cross.<eos> - No!<eos> I beseech you!
Are you unwell?<eos> Thank you for your... presence of mind.<eos> Was she also...<eos> I'll need to examine her.<eos> She'll never let you.
You have a higher duty... Protecting this child's life.<eos> - I should lie to her?<eos> - Through omission.<eos> Not for long.<eos> Heaven will thank you.
Your fingerprints were on it.<eos> At Union Station, I used a crowbar to open up the locker.<eos> Somebody must have picked it up.<eos> And that someone just happened to know that you'd be paying Officer Pinkney a visit tonight?<eos> I told you, I didn't know that he lived there.
What's up?<eos> Mr. Cupcake, pleasure to meet you.<eos> My name's Alfred Pennyworth.<eos> Now, we're on the hunt for a guy called Matches Malone.<eos> Now, we know he snitched you up a few years ago.
Eh? You can't unfry an egg, as my dear old mum used to say.<eos> So why don't we leave Master Bruce's situation alone and why don't we discuss yours.<eos> Eh? It's a long story.<eos> Right, so you were framed for the murder of that other police officer.<eos> You escaped from prison, you then tracked down the man that framed you and you were promptly shot in the leg.
No, she didn't.<eos> We complained about Gina for an hour, and then he opened up... gave me the name of the guy he works for.<eos> I have never been so insulted in my entire life.<eos> I'm not gonna work cases for you guys anymore.<eos> We were never going to ask you to.
How dare you?<eos> I was just trying to help.<eos> Wow, your help feels an awful lot like pity, so do me a favor and don't ever help me again.<eos> Wow, well, you didn't seem to mind me helping you when I got you your job back at the Nine-Nine.<eos> I didn't ask you to do that.
Everybody's pissed at me.<eos> No, no, we're not.<eos> We're all supporting you.<eos> We're doing separate checks, right?<eos> I told you, we're splitting it.
Is that Harper James?<eos> Yes.<eos> Dr. Ulmer would like to speak with you.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll just connect you.
Is that Harper James?<eos> Yes.<eos> Dr. Ulmer would like to speak with you.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll just connect you.
The Commissioner didn't answer?<eos> You're playing me, right?<eos> Let's play it all the way then!<eos> Leaving so soon, Officer Wu?<eos> Mr Tycoon is looking for you.
- Were you smuggling?<eos> - No, I wasn't smuggling.<eos> I was trying to get here.<eos> - Who are you working with?<eos> - Uh... I'd tell you, but you wouldn't believe me.
Where professional interaction has a social component.<eos> Did you two chat on the phone a lot? We spoke.<eos> Yeah, we saw that.<eos> Saw what?<eos> That he called you.
Excuse me.<eos> The toilets have become very dirty.<eos> They're stinking.<eos> You're the boss, aren't you?<eos> That's why I am telling you.
- What?<eos> Look, Saddam Hussain has permitted... us Indians to get out of Kuwait.<eos> But we don't know where to go... when or how?<eos> If you could help us, then it'll be really great.<eos> Let me speak to the Minister and call you back.
Why are you getting involved?<eos> He's the kid, not me.<eos> She spoke in Arabic.<eos> You're a Kuwaiti, aren't you?<eos> I'm telling you...
I... ah, I forgot my nephews.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I'm gonna get two more.<eos> Hi, I'm Ms. Alonso from the Cook County Public Defender's Office.<eos> I've been assigned to represent you at your arraignment today.
Wake.<eos> Touch on you.<eos> Monsieur Kananga.<eos> Please!<eos> I heard you the first time!
If you don't ask, you don't get.<eos> Prince Vassily!<eos> Prince Vassily.<eos> You know, I've never asked you for anything.<eos> I've never reminded you of what my father did for you, but now, I beg you, for my boy, Boris, a word from you to the sovereign would be enough.
It's gonna be okay, sir. I...<eos> I just know that Maria's gonna pull through.<eos> I'm just so sorry to leave both of you in this situation... principal-less just as the school year is picking up steam.<eos> But Maria needs me now. Uh, Principal Welles?<eos> I don't want to make light of the situation, but for my own knowledge, sir, and if you don't feel comfortable saying, please feel free to decline, but do you know who will be replacing you?
- Isn't it though?<eos> - Mm! Now, North Jackson's not the newest school Mm-hmm.<eos> in the district, but it is to me hands down the most charming. Even more charming now that you're here, Dr. Brown.<eos> - Oh! Why thank you, Mr. Russell.<eos> Flattery will get you everywhere.
- Jesus Christ.<eos> You sure follow directions.<eos> Just go on.<eos> I'll be there in a bit.<eos> Yeah, I was just telling you.
Forgive me for running late, I do have a budget meeting with the super I need to prepare for.<eos> Do you boys mind handling this one yourselves?<eos> Oh, of course not, darling, please go inside, do what you need to do.<eos> Let us know if you need anything.<eos> - Hmm. - I told you.
I said that's enough.<eos> Stay off my property, Lee.<eos> I won't warn you again.<eos> Go home.<eos> I warned you.
I hope you aren't afraid of the dark, ed.<eos> Should've given me that bonus, ed.<eos> This is what happens to scrooges like you.<eos> Ain't the holidays hell?<eos> Uvu uvu shows you you!
Before this all started, I saw you sailing at the Cairo Yacht Club.<eos> Did you?<eos> Well, that's only when I'm invited.<eos> Which isn't often, to be honest.<eos> Who invites you?
I'll give you a Christmas Bonus.<eos> What good with money do me?<eos> It will be my goose that's cooked.<eos> Listen, have you ever heard me beg anything of anyone, ever? - No.<eos> - Good, well, I'm begging you.
Mak sure you don't lose them, especially this one.<eos> But, this...<eos> - This is money? - Yes.<eos> I think it will be difficult to get used to everything, eh?<eos> Maybe this will help you.
Now you look like an agent.<eos> - Hold this. - Agent...<eos> Let's see, let me.<eos> I do not know who invented this damned contraption.<eos> - Hold still, I might choke you.
Thank you.<eos> - Sure you just want water? - Thank you.<eos> Yes, yes, you know I don't drink.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I see that not even an extreme situation can change you.
It's still too soon, I guess.<eos> We have to keep our distance.<eos> But as you all say, "todo se andar√°."<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I'll call you later.
I came to New York - to reveal that to the whole world.<eos> - No, that's not the secret.<eos> Well then, what is?<eos> Fine, if you don't want to tell me, it's cool, yeah?<eos> I'm not going to tell you.
I saw the body up close.<eos> No animal does that!<eos> His head was cut clean off, his arms were cut clean off!<eos> There wasn't a bite mark on him... plus, his fucking heart was ripped out!<eos> I would've told you sooner, but I've been trying to process it myself.
Great.<eos> I hope nothing happens before then.<eos> Eleanor.<eos> Nothing's gonna happen.<eos> Billets is gonna send some cops to pick you up at the airport, and take you to my place.
I'll get it.<eos> Wash.<eos> I didn't call for the car.<eos> There's been an officer involved shooting.<eos> I got a call to pick you up and bring you to the scene.
Any?<eos> All?<eos> Send search parties into the slums.<eos> Find his co-conspirators and bring them to me.<eos> You want me to leave you alone... with him?
- I will.<eos> I gotta go, all right?<eos> I'm gonna call you as soon as I can.<eos> I love you.<eos> Hey, Sarge, heard you on the radio this afternoon.
You two were inseparable.<eos> I know, but come on.<eos> She's in Pennsylvania, I'm in Connecticut.<eos> -Why didn't you tell me?<eos> -I'm telling you now.
And I will always go to err on the side prudence and time because at the end of the day, it is a far lesser price to pay than that of a young life.<eos> I can sympathize with what you've been through and it might be good of you to understand our position as well.<eos> Well, maybe so, but your position is always gonna be sitting up there, looking down at all of us, people you know nothing about.<eos> If you have a problem with me sitting up here, you can take it up with the mayor's office before they reappoint me.<eos> And I don't presume to know you beyond the confines of this courtroom, but I can assure you, you don't know anything about us either.
He blames you implicitly for what happened.<eos> Hey!<eos> Taxi!<eos> What the hell?<eos> I nearly killed you...
- Move!<eos> - All right, all right.<eos> Hey, you in a hurry, then?<eos> Something like that.<eos> Is there any particular place you want me to drive you to?
I'm sorry, she's out of the office.<eos> Is there someone else you'd like to talk to?<eos> Or would you like her voice mail?<eos> Once all that stuff is done, if you have any questions, just either shoot me an email, or call me on my cell phone.<eos> Kirkland and Allen, may I help you?
Okay.<eos> There's a record guy coming to see me, and I really, really, really wanna impress him, you know?<eos> That's what this is about.<eos> Fuck you, Mylene.<eos> I wouldn't have asked you if it wasn't truly important to me.
- Well, they are not brushed properly, so, great, well done, all right? - Your breath stinks. - Why are you being such a bitch?<eos> - What?<eos> Don't you dare... - (HORN HONKS)<eos> All right, you know what?<eos> Everything is canceled for you this week and next.
You illiterate brute!<eos> Report me?<eos> I'll report you.<eos> I'll drag you before the board of Magistrates.<eos> I'll pay someone to kill you!
- At what?<eos> - Blackmail.<eos> Is that something you really want on your timeline this late in the game, Cheryl?<eos> You know, I just did an hour on corporate ageism on my podcast last month, and I would really hate to have to repeat myself.<eos> She told you.
I mean, I don't know the difference between On Walden Pond or "On Golden Pond."<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> Just read it.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm telling you.
Keep movin'.<eos> - Here we go!<eos> - Let's go!<eos> - You know I can't tell him what to do, Jen.<eos> I'm just tellin' you what he told me.
- I remember.<eos> Sorry about the knee.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> He's gonna be good to go by the fall.<eos> Um, you mind if I join you for a sec?
Oh, my goodness.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> What?<eos> Hey, brah. I say... What?<eos> Okay. I tell you about my girlfriend?
That's a joke, right?<eos> No.<eos> I'm sorry, what's happening here?<eos> You're banking on an image, correct?<eos> I mean, in beauty... [clears throat] you live or die by how the world sees you.
And, uh, one last signature here.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> We are official part owners of the bar!<eos> - Ah! - Yes!<eos> Sir, we won't let you down.
- Ah! - Yes!<eos> Sir, we won't let you down.<eos> I'm just a notary.<eos> Hey, the note... arize.<eos> All right, we're not gonna let you down.
Do you have any other line of questioning for this witness at this time, Mr. weber?<eos> My lord, i have no further questions.<eos> Miss marais.<eos> As the court pleases.<eos> So, you say that the execution process and the work in the pit room upset you greatly. Is that what you're saying?
You have to speak up.<eos> The evidence has to be recorded and a nod or a shake of your head will not be recorded.<eos> Miss marais is right.<eos> Speak up and direct your answers to us.<eos> So, you're saying that the execution process and the work in the pit room upset you greatly.
And the smoke leaked out with his family there for the funeral.<eos> It wasn't me.<eos> All you have to do is say yes or no.<eos> If any explanation is needed, i will ask you for an explanation.<eos> Otherwise, you can leave your explanations for later when your advocate re-examines you.
Two years ago, you were a school prefect and active in the church.<eos> And now you're here in court, on trial for murder.<eos> How did that happen?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You were a husband, a father, but now neither your wife nor your daughter will visit you in the cells and they've not attended court, either, have they?
And frankly, I don't know why the suits at Delos put up with it.<eos> Sorry, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to cut you off.<eos> - Do you know who I am?<eos> - I do.<eos> Ms. Cullen told me to find you and relay a message.
Okay.<eos> All right.<eos> All right.<eos> Ron, let's go.<eos> Sorry, I'm forced to inform you that I can no longer provide you with legal counsel.
Please.<eos> No.<eos> Okay.<eos> I have my period.<eos> I told you at the house.
Oh, yeah?<eos> How much?<eos> 4,000.<eos> Seriously, though, how much?<eos> I can pay you back.
MARJA owes me 2,000 euros.<eos> - What?<eos> I owe you 600.<eos> I have it all written down.<eos> I wouldn't have borrowed from you had I known...
Well, hell, you got a pool back home?<eos> Why are you staying in this shithole?<eos> Well, we just wanted to get out of town for a while.<eos> Well, I will definitely get you them tools.<eos> I'm much obliged to you.
You ain't wet.<eos> -Hey, less talk, more walk, inmate.<eos> Did you just push her?<eos> Officer, what's your name?<eos> I haven't seen you before.
"The voice of suffering was heard."<eos> You really are quite good at this.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I think if you look at the judgment closely, you'll see there are all sorts of things there in my favor.<eos> You're not seriously suggesting that this judgment supports you?
I won't even ask when.<eos> And Antoine, well...<eos> He'll be more bitter about you, even more lost.<eos> Suzanne wants to leave.<eos> She told you.
You have any reason to believe you won't be able to keep these appointments?<eos> I'll do my best.<eos> I have a lot of uncertainty in my life, but I'll... I'll do my best.<eos> Well, I'll prescribe a mild course of Risperidone, and you and I will see each other tomorrow.<eos> Is someone picking you up?
Enough to be hospitalized.<eos> I'm sorry to disappoint you, Detective.<eos> I don't know where you got your information.<eos> You're sure about that?<eos> Damien never touched you?
Go get your diamonds.<eos> Have a nice life.<eos> With half a billion, you can afford to stay the fuck out of mine.<eos> Come on, Logan.<eos> I could really use that "I told you so" look right about now.
- See you tonight.<eos> You're not real.<eos> None of this is real.<eos> Please go away.<eos> I'm begging you.
It's your lucky day.<eos> I happen to have money.<eos> Lots of money.<eos> - How much?<eos> - I just told you.
And we are back, in living color, with our exclusive interview with the president of the United States, Richard Milhous Nixon.<eos> Mr. President, before the break, we were discussing the pending impeachment investigation.<eos> And I guess we're all wondering, how are you feeling about your ability to defend yourself against the charges?<eos> Well, that's very interesting to hear you say that, Mr. President.<eos> It begs the question, is it paranoia if indeed everyone is coming after you?
I have to say goodbye to someone.<eos> The fireworks are starting.<eos> Mom?<eos> Are you home?<eos> I'm telling you, man, you got to take it to Tug.
Mrs. Cazacracker do you call her?<eos> You know.<eos> Come on. Uh, chickens are a very serious...<eos> An entire community imperiled.<eos> It begs the question, is it paranoia if everyone is indeed coming after you?
You'll be like, "Oh, shit, it's cold in Pluto!"<eos> Yeah, well, I'm gonna fuck you at the Stephen Hawking exhibit.<eos> And I'm gonna ram your ass so hard that I cause a tear in the time-space continuum.<eos> I'll fuck you through slavery times, and you'll get your freedom papers.<eos> Yeah, well, I'm gonna rent me a DeLorean and fuck you back to the future.
Our sign is barely legible.<eos> Our address is wrong in the city directory.<eos> And yet, somehow, they find us.<eos> Come.<eos> I'll show you right through.
Bernard Cohen.<eos> It's a pleasure.<eos> Thank you for coming in today.<eos> So, as we discussed on the phone, the ACLU would like to take on your case.<eos> I was actually a charter member of the ACLU in Virginia, which is why they assigned me to you.
"Thank you for today."<eos> "Goodnight, Rip Van Winkle."<eos> Hi, there.<eos> Hello.<eos> - Thank you for last time.
Hello?<eos> What's going on?<eos> I'm listening.<eos> Is Mashiro a porn star?<eos> Didn't she tell you?
I thought I already was one.<eos> Greater god.<eos> Don't you fuckin' touch me!<eos> Or my cellphone.<eos> I was going to tell you about the compliance gag, but you didn't show up at the charity dinner, and then...
Like your boss said, might get you killed.<eos> Well, that's what I keep hearing.<eos> Nobody wants to share this dangerous entity's idea with me.<eos> Maybe you know.<eos> So your friend's keeping you in the dark too.
If the Templarios are crazy enough to take over a police precinct, they won't hesitate to kill anyone who gets in their way.<eos> Considering the situation, perhaps you should call for back up.<eos> It had to be a cop who let the Templarios out in the first place.<eos> I'm not involving any more until we know who we can trust.<eos> Given the number of convicts you're up against, I urge you to reconsider.
Did you speak to Detective Fusco?<eos> I hope the good detective is okay.<eos> He is now, no thanks to you.<eos> Perhaps if you had told me about my friend Bruce's death, I wouldn't have had to resort to other sources.<eos> I didn't tell you because I was afraid you would seek retribution.
I've got an agent headed to Washington with a flashlight.<eos> It'll probably take him a couple of hours to dig yours up.<eos> Unless you want to save him the time.<eos> My friend. What happened to her?<eos> Well... If you talk to me... I'll tell you about your friend.
The only thing left of me is the sound of my voice.<eos> I was built to predict people, but to predict them, you have to truly understand them.<eos> So I began by breaking their lives down into moments...<eos> Trying to find the connections, the things that explained why they did what they did.<eos> I'm telling you, never seen anything like it.
Come with me.<eos> I can't.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - Because I'd drive you crazy.<eos> - I'd ruin everything for you.
- The fuck's going on?<eos> - Just get in the fucking van.<eos> - You can't just get away with that.<eos> That man is molesting that boy!<eos> I saw you. I'm calling the police!
And don't worry, I'm gonna prove that it's true.<eos> That what's true?<eos> Her whole story.<eos> Everything she went through.<eos> She told you?
At all.<eos> Come on, bankrupting Marty Stein's gotta bring a little smile to your face.<eos> Yeah, you don't know Marty.<eos> This Federal Asset Forfeiture shit, that's some fucked up shit.<eos> I'm telling you right now.
Assaulting a federal agent is a felony, Marty.<eos> You have the right to remain silent.<eos> Anything you say can and will be used against in a court of law.<eos> You have the right to an attorney.<eos> If you can't afford an attorney one can be provided to you.
If that twat used the word ghettoizing, I'll kill her.<eos> She's smart. She had all sorts of ideas, Richie.<eos> You were there.<eos> Why didn't you tell me?<eos> I'm telling you now.
So you were gonna fuck him for the good of the company? That was your plan?<eos> I was gonna grind on the dance floor until the song ended and then suck you off in the bathroom.<eos> That was my plan.<eos> So that maybe for five minutes you'd remember that you're into me almost as much as you're into men who can sell fucking records. You know what?<eos> Fuck you with "I don't love you enough."
Who are you?<eos> I'm Phyllis.<eos> Sit.<eos> And you run this place?<eos> Didn't Snyder tell you?
are you here for work?<eos> It's all right. You don't have to be kind to me.<eos> I know I took a spiked dildo and I frickin' rammed it right into your heart hole.<eos> I'm really sorry. Seriously, Abigail, I'm fine.<eos> Honestly, Shoshanna, it's hard for me to see you like this, working in what is clearly a sex hut.
I mean, the world, it's here.<eos> It's inside.<eos> That's what you gotta live for.<eos> You can't worry about what's going on out there.<eos> Whatever trouble you're in, I just don't know you well enough, and I'm gonna stop talking.
Oh, can I have one of those?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> Well, you sure do look a lot better than the last time I saw you.
Can you help me?<eos> Help me!<eos> - How's she doing?<eos> - She's better.<eos> She said if I saw you out here to send you in.
He found you.<eos> Mr. Cole?<eos> Sir?<eos> James Cole!<eos> My apologies, Mr. Cole, but we have you in the wrong room.
Let me show you.<eos> Okay, I can't let you do this!<eos> Then you can have a mouthful of it when you eat it.<eos> What? I have to eat it too?<eos> If no plucking and no eating... then I can't do business with you!
That's enough to take down a rhinoceros.<eos> Easy as pie.<eos> Mr. Jarvis, are you all right?<eos> Marvelous!<eos> Ah. Chief Sousa, what brings you here?
Well, he knows talent when he sees it.<eos> How about this?<eos> An enhanced motion detector.<eos> Gives you accurate readings from up to 50 feet away.<eos> If anybody tries to sneak up on you, this will tell us.
Don't you remember?<eos> That hurts me... right here.<eos> Listen, I interviewed a lot of prospects.<eos> But you picked me.<eos> And I picked you because I thought I'd be doing more than tinkering around this lab while other agents went off on missions.
Look at what it's done to me, to you.<eos> We can change the world.<eos> The world's just fine as it is.<eos> Is it?<eos> Do you... do you really believe that Isodyne recruited you because they valued your brilliant mind?
He's soft like Macaulay Culkin, Home Alone.<eos> Do the...<eos> Oh!<eos> Hey...<eos> I'm not gay, but I'd do you.
Now, I have many vices.<eos> Hypocrisy is not one of them.<eos> So you will resume your duties, but this time... you will be more discreet.<eos> Thank you, Your Highness.<eos> His Highness will see you now.
Thank you, Sigurd.<eos> Of course he has.<eos> There you are.<eos> I'm sorry to keep you waiting.<eos> The Prime Minister will see you now.
I'm surprised you're still talking to me.<eos> Yeah, what you believe in on your own is your business now, as long as you show up here and do your job.<eos> I'm going to the morning briefing.<eos> I'll head upstairs with you.<eos> Oh, they didn't tell you?
No can do, Randers.<eos> Neither can I!<eos> Listen, it happened a long time ago, Randy!<eos> It's going to fucking ruin a lot of people's lives unless you help me.<eos> Look, I'm begging you, bud!
When you say 'em quick.<eos> Be patient, dawg.<eos> Ain't nuttin' wrong with her. It's a new arrangement, you know I mean?<eos> This ain't no place for kids to grow up.<eos> Suckas hassling you to spit rhymes.
- It's a bullshit charge.<eos> - There's gonna be an investigation.<eos> Until then, you're on administrative leave.<eos> Where is Gary Keyes, Mr. Kelly?<eos> I've told you, I don't know.
Where is Gary Keyes, Mr. Kelly?<eos> I've told you, I don't know.<eos> Keep selling me that same horseshit, we're gonna be at this all day.<eos> Is that supposed to make me change my answers?<eos> I'm telling you, that's all I know.
This is a favorite spot of mine, actually.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Well, you have terrible taste in spots.<eos> Oh, you're only saying that because this is your first time here.<eos> Well, let me show you around a little bit, before you make up your mind.
Yes.<eos> Like a sister.<eos> History is right, of course, to judge him on moral grounds.<eos> But, as a man of science... I can't help but admire him.<eos> The duty nurse will escort you to our isolation wing.
I'm not supposed to.<eos> Why's that?<eos> On the account of my condition.<eos> Thought the water made you better.<eos> Told you.
Yeah. But there was an accident.<eos> What accident?<eos> What?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> They said they called you.
I don't want trouble.<eos> He's Ice Nation.<eos> Who's this?<eos> A prisoner for our Queen.<eos> I told you... I don't want trouble.
I'm going to your house right now.<eos> Seol, Seol.<eos> If by any chance Seol gets hurt, I won't leave you alone.<eos> I'll kill you.<eos> You should have left when I told you to.
But who's being technical?<eos> We need to get to the cellblock.<eos> These nanobots aren't making it easy to get to the prison section.<eos> DR. OCTOPUS: No need to chase me, Spider-Man.<eos> I'll make it easy on you.
Sorry.<eos> (GROANING CONTINUES) Sorry.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Warned you.
"New acting coach"?<eos> No. - Come on.<eos> - No.<eos> It's true.<eos> Thank you for the other day.
I have had an account here for 50 years.<eos> That is no way to treat a customer, closing down like this.<eos> Well, times change, I'm afraid.<eos> We're all very sad here.<eos> Now, if you want to take a seat, I'll call a cab to take you home.
Hey, Captain, we got you some hostages.<eos> Team two, go get 'em.<eos> Everyone else cover.<eos> -What about me?<eos> -No, you we need.
Now, why aren't we out looking for Mia instead of sitting around and fucking talking about it?<eos> We have road blocks at three and five miles from the site.<eos> We have an APB out state-wide.<eos> I'm gonna grab a coffee.<eos> I have told you a thousand times... I have no idea where they took her.
What did he want?<eos> I don't know, actually.<eos> And yet you still decided to come down to the office.<eos> He wanted to tell me something, yeah.<eos> He couldn't tell you on the phone?
Baird is a good family man.<eos> He has a high ankle sprain.<eos> Mr. Mannix?<eos> What's up, Peanut?<eos> Natalie told me to find you PDQ.
No way.<eos> Randy,<eos> I need it. Don't let those...<eos> excuse my language...<eos> Don't let those friggin' butchy frig-bitches frig you over like this!
Good morning, Mr. Reed.<eos> Morning, kids.<eos> Wow, they're so well-behaved.<eos> Well, we strive to create an environment of learning that fosters emotional safety and respect for boundaries.<eos> I'll leave you to it.
Let me ask around for you.<eos> Would you do that for me?<eos> I'd do that for Molly.<eos> All I ask is, don't take it out on your family.<eos> Molly loves you and she needs you to step up and be her dad.
Assuming I've been here before... which I would know, obviously.<eos> Have we met?<eos> No, I don't believe we have.<eos> Right, 'cause you got a very forgettable face.<eos> You want people to remember you, maybe get a personality, right?
Why so cold?<eos> What's a smoke show like you doing working for NetCar?<eos> I'm not your baby.<eos> I don't know about that.<eos> I do know you're smoking hot. I'd do you in a heartbeat.
You can see we have one of yours.<eos> We'll trade.<eos> I'm listening.<eos> First I want to talk to Maggie and Carol, make sure they're all right.<eos> I'm gonna put you on. You say you're fine.
How many days a week do you stay over there?<eos> I'm guessing 3.5.<eos> He's very meticulous.<eos> I try to be fair.<eos> He tell you?
What?<eos> What's happening?<eos> Sir, I have an exemption.<eos> Emre.<eos> I warned you.
Pastor Merril?<eos> Yes. Who are you?<eos> I'm Christopher Myers from the Associated Press.<eos> I have correspondence from the US Embassy, and I have money from the Church Relief Fund.<eos> God bless you.
I'm Christopher Myers from the Associated Press.<eos> I have correspondence from the US Embassy, and I have money from the Church Relief Fund.<eos> God bless you.<eos> You're heaven sent.<eos> God bless you.
And tell him we'll be along with the rest of the orphans as soon as we can.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You're a brave man.<eos> Thank you.<eos> God bless you.
"A Turkish official, "a man of unshakeable humanity and courage, "informed us that Faruk Pasha,<eos> Are these words your fabrications, or the words of some lying Turkish traitor?<eos> Prove to me that you did not fabricate these words.<eos> Give me the name of the high-ranking Turkish official.<eos> I'll confirm he gave you this information and release you.
They're ripe right now, with all the immigration stuff.<eos> Yeah... yeah, this is great!<eos> So, there's one more thing.<eos> Go ahead, shoot.<eos> The reason he's helping you is because he feels that you are a man of action, as he is.
- Now, tom, look...<eos> - Now, tom, look, what?<eos> Really, what could you possibly have to say?<eos> Because this is a fucking disaster!<eos> I warned you, i tried to tell you.
- [keys jangle]<eos> - Hey.<eos> - [door closes] - Where's Wendy?<eos> At work.<eos> She didn't tell you?
If there are no regulations, except those governed by the laws of common sense, then there's no cheats.<eos> It's a level playing field.<eos> This is what the fans want and this is what my organization plans to give them, thank you.<eos> Even if this means a clear and present danger to your fighters?<eos> Well, you know what, I invite you to take a good look at these two fine specimens and tell me if either of them look like they're in any sort of medical duress to you.
Hey, everybody, nice to see you.<eos> Brody, Brody, Brody.<eos> Sawadee, Mr. Kanarot.<eos> Good morning to you, too.<eos> So, how is Thailand treating you, Mr. James?
A chance for us to put the past behind us.<eos> Behave like brothers again.<eos> Is that so?<eos> There was nothing I wanted more.<eos> He accused you of burning his research.
I did it.<eos> I finally did it.<eos> It must have been an uncomfortable feeling, all that digging going on when you literally had a secret buried in the village.<eos> No comment.<eos> We have DNA evidence linking you to the attack on Reverend James and the burglary of the church.
I won't let this happen to you.<eos> Abby, listen.<eos> Anyone caught helping us will be condemned to death, too.<eos> Then I won't get caught.<eos> Look. I'm begging you...
Octavia, come on.<eos> We need you.<eos> Clear some space.<eos> What the hell happened to her?<eos> I told you on the radio.
You're my responsibility.<eos> I created you.<eos> I need no man to save me.<eos> And I think, in a way,<eos> I created you more than you created me.
We have to get help.<eos> So your uncle died.<eos> - Uncle...<eos> - Ted.<eos> I told you.
Assume the position.<eos> Study the wall.<eos> There's gonna be a quiz.<eos> Look, man, what is all this about?<eos> I told you.
Which is exactly when that hippie flit makes detective.<eos> Oh, excuse me.<eos> I got to...<eos> It's your mom.<eos> I did warn you.
- Hello, Sam.<eos> - Much on?<eos> - I called Hallward's art supplier.<eos> He has a place at Osney.<eos> Thought I'd take a look once I've dropped you at the station.
So if you give us a description or a name...<eos> - Is that meant to be some kind of joke?<eos> I know you.<eos> Jamie spoke about you.<eos> He looked up to you.
All units hold position.<eos> We have a report of shots fired earlier on a rooftop up on 10th.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - I lost my keys!<eos> - Your kid locked you out?
Shotgun axe.<eos> Aah!<eos> You beat them.<eos> You did that.<eos> This is why I didn't tell you.
Okay, I already reached out to Cappello's casting director and I quote,<eos> "Cappello is not going to hire the face of Monkey Up to star in his next film."<eos> A computer cannot act.<eos> You need to convince him he needs me.<eos> I'm a trained actor, thank you very much.
Finally calling to apologize after all this time.<eos> Nope, just calling to call.<eos> Gabi told me you're not dating that Indian fellow anymore.<eos> Finally came to your senses.<eos> But I'm not going to rub your face in it and say, "5 told you so," but I told you so.
No sign of a struggle.<eos> She'd been a mardy one all weekend.<eos> Ever since I found that lass.<eos> She wanted me out from under her feet.<eos> - Sent you to the pub?
And you smashing Suren's jaw into it comes to mind.<eos> That was one time.<eos> Welcome.<eos> It's an honor to welcome you to Karakorum.<eos> My father expected you a week ago.
I was pleased to simply pay my respect to my Khan.<eos> And Lord Kaidu of Karakorum wishes to pay his respects to you.<eos> He invites you to feast this evening.<eos> I decline.<eos> He'll want us to convince you otherwise.
Gideon, get me Jefferson.<eos> Mr. Jackson is not aboard.<eos> Oh, don't tell me...<eos> He's with Mr. Snart and Mr. Rory on the Jumpship.<eos> I'm patching you through.
I doubt if I can explain.<eos> I doubt you'll understand.<eos> All I know is...<eos> No one can defeat you unless you defeat yourself.<eos> Master, the federation officials are asking for you.
Well, actually, Mrs Lorimer, I'm hoping that I can help you. Paul Marlock.<eos> Your boyfriend.<eos> He's a conman.<eos> You should drop him.<eos> Did Felix put you up to this?
One minute.<eos> One minute now.<eos> -<eos> Six's still last -<eos> I'll swap you.
Because he has a delusional understanding of risk.<eos> Even when it's obvious to everyone around him that he should just fold,<eos> Harry Clayton still thinks he can beat the odds.<eos> Must make him a very dangerous man to work with!<eos> Harry does just fine. Thank you.
What is it?<eos> It's a table rigging device.<eos> You found that here?<eos> Have you arrested the croupier responsible for introducing this?<eos> I'm just incredibly grateful to you, officers...
Hello, Bennet.<eos> And this you've done on nothing but the suspicion of one woman?<eos> A woman who... forgive me, Mr. Reid.<eos> I currently lack for energy and therefore tact, but this is a woman for whom you shamed your wife, is it not?<eos> I did warn you.
It's okay.<eos> But I know marrying you includes marrying your girls as well.<eos> Amen to that.<eos> I do.<eos> I didn't ask you yet.
Since when?<eos> - Last night.<eos> You okay?<eos> Let's just not with the concern and the feelings.<eos> I'm only telling you 'cause Jake's going to tell you anyway, and I probably come off really bad in his version.
Can I talk about the elephant in the room for a second?<eos> I wish you wouldn't.<eos> I look across from me and I don't see a monster.<eos> I see a human being fighting to control the animalistic parts of his brain, true grit overcoming impulse.<eos> Not everybody judges you.
Then don't ask it of me.<eos> Let me help you.<eos> You're not ill, so you tell me.<eos> So... what are you?<eos> I've told you.
Listen.<eos> Listen.<eos> I want that paper, Butch.<eos> I told you, I ain't got it. Uhh! I told you I want that paper, Butch!<eos> Hey! - I told you.
I'm sorry.<eos> Some woman found Ms. Gordon, name of Colleen Miles.<eos> She found the, uh, victim in a state of undress.<eos> Undress?<eos> They didn't tell you?
Remembering's dangerous.<eos> I find the past such a worrying, anxious place.<eos> Yes, memory is so treacherous.<eos> One moment you're lost in a carnival of delight, childhood aromas, the flashing neon of puberty, all that sentimental candyfloss.<eos> The next, it takes you somewhere you don't want to be.
Hey, somebody wants you.<eos> Uh-uh-uh. No fair hiding.<eos> Ugh. Well, I'd see why.<eos> You don't look so good.<eos> Well, I don't blame you, not when that bowl of cherries some call life, turned out to be the pits of hell.
No.<eos> That'll be all, Doctor, thank you.<eos> You will have no memory of this.<eos> Not of this treatment, nor of your crimes, nor of your sins, nor of your time in this horrid place.<eos> Every moment that has benighted your life and set you on your dark course...
Through iron will and violent force, and the glory of God are empires born.<eos> There are mountains named after me.<eos> And at what cost?<eos> Your home's empty.<eos> Your son hates you.
Revolutionists.<eos> Women who are strong, and refuse to be degraded, and choose to protect themselves, are called monsters.<eos> That is the world's crime, not ours.<eos> Who wishes to try?<eos> I shan't go easy on you.
Who are you?<eos> Catriona Hartdegen.<eos> - I'm the one who...<eos> - Burned me.<eos> Saved you, some might argue.
Dude!<eos> Phones, man...<eos> - Hello?<eos> - Uh, hello. Mr. hariri?<eos> Mr. Henderson is waiting for you by the sedona stage.
Oh, one other thing:<eos> I want you to downgrade the search for Atticus Nevins.<eos> Minor resources only.<eos> Why the hell would I do that?<eos> Because I ordered you to.
Trust me.<eos> What's... What's happening?<eos> Plan B.<eos> Liam, slow down. Liam, wait!<eos> I told you.
Not everything.<eos> You're still here.<eos> Yeah, it seems like you got some kind of a plan.<eos> So why don't you tell us about it?<eos> I can tell you.
Not in the slightest.<eos> (Jazz playing)<eos> Back inside enemy lines, huh? I hardly think we're enemies, Marcellus.<eos> I know where your loyalties lie. If I had know that they were gonna go after Hayley,<eos> I would have warned you.
Apocalypse 20:10:<eos> "And the false prophet "shall be tormented by day and by night for ever and ever."<eos> It's like I said a prayer and there you were.<eos> Thank you, Padre.<eos> And now my sergeant here will escort you from my crime scene.
Have I really?<eos> I say, that's rather good.<eos> This isn't a joke, Mr Bishop.<eos> Clearly not, Inspector, which is why I would appreciate you getting to the point.<eos> I think Vivian Wolsey was blackmailing you.
Let's make a deal.<eos> I'll tell you everything.<eos> You look into something.<eos> Here's a deal.<eos> Tell us everything, and I don't cuff you in front of your co-workers and take you in.
You've just given me the perfect example of unbridled jealousy.<eos> I'm not jealous.<eos> I'm not.<eos> The woman that you loved was with someone else, someone you thought wasn't worthy of her.<eos> But no matter what you did... she never saw you the way you wanted her to.
You care to explain why you were caught pawning Tim Dunlear's championship ring?<eos> Listen, more importantly, why did you take it to a pawnshop?<eos> The Dark Web has much better margins.<eos> I swear I didn't do nothing.<eos> Witnesses put you at the scene.
A beer.<eos> Of course.<eos> We'd very much like to know what you just realized.<eos> Too bad.<eos> I'm not telling you.
- Maxwell Lord.<eos> Bizarro didn't come after me as Supergirl this time, she came after me as Kara.<eos> He knows who I am, which means he knows where I work, he knows we're sisters, about Eliza.<eos> Nowhere, no one is safe anymore.<eos> I warned you!
It's part of my job.<eos> Not yours.<eos> So you just need to let me do it.<eos> Please.<eos> I'm asking you as a friend.
I feel guilty for many things... But this?<eos> Never.<eos> Where does it end?<eos> He kills Anna, you kill him.<eos> They kill you.
Who would bake pot into perfectly innocent cookies?<eos> It was probably that awful Mary Jane.<eos> I am gonna go find her, and when I do, I am gonna give her a piece of my mind.<eos> Pulled a lot of strings with my boss to get us into the firm's skybox, so do not let me down, Wheeler.<eos> Otherwise, the next box that I get you into will have handles on the side.
how have you been?<eos> Every night I have the same nightmare do you?<eos> There's nothing to worry about.<eos> Why are you still Lengcheng?<eos> Everyone is trying to get you.
OK.<eos> The day we packed up our house, I slept with Frankie.<eos> It was an emotional day and it didn't mean anything more than an ending.<eos> Even so, I wish to God I could take it back.<eos> I was going to tell you, but then you had the attack...
My students just arrived.<eos> I see Gary and some of the other guys, so I'm gonna go hang out with them.<eos> Why? Why? Why?<eos> 'Cause I don't wanna get scolded tonight.<eos> I'm not gonna scold you. Why, was I...
Yeah.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> You see what he does, though?<eos> How does he even do that?<eos> That's the whole point why I'm showing you.
I'm me Man. I ain't tryin' to be nothing else<eos> Okay So. You hard now.<eos> - I ain't saying that.<eos> - Well then what?<eos> Hey hey..hey I ain't tryin' to hear you up..just I ain't see you in a minute and its
You're making it up as you go along.<eos> Look, I...<eos> - You are an amazing magician...<eos> - Don't patronize me.<eos> - I'm not patronizing you.
- When are you gonna tell me what all this is for?<eos> - I did.<eos> Bigger, better magic.<eos> - Yeah, you just never mentioned how.<eos> - I guess I could tell you now.
The Emperor Hirohito is a figure of great importance.<eos> It's through him that we'll legitimize and justify our reform program moving forward.<eos> -Are you telling me-- -[knocking on door]<eos> [MacArthur] Yes?<eos> [man] Your next meeting is waiting for you, sir.
All units, withdraw!<eos> It's over.<eos> The strongest will prevail.<eos> - Where's my son?<eos> - Your wife and your child call to you.
Starvation.<eos> He wants to end all that.<eos> And you can help him.<eos> Yeah, but help him how?<eos> He will show you when you are ready.
- Or so you've been told.<eos> Professor Setrakian informs me that your wife is one of the Master's principal servants.<eos> - What about it?<eos> - I believe there are other elemental human emotions at play here as well as a parent's love, such as hatred and revenge.<eos> Don't shy away from the truth of what motivates you, Doctor.
Now, there must be another room here.<eos> Sudden immolation, a fitting end for a visionary, no?<eos> If it is my time to go, then so be it.<eos> Who were those men in there?<eos> They were clients of my associate, Saskia, the woman who sent you here.
Neil Jenkins.<eos> - I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> - Marcus Knight is the real name of John Green, the man who was murdered only hours after you were seen at his hotel.<eos> The man you told us you didn't know.<eos> Even though he visited you six years ago.
The man you told us you didn't know.<eos> Even though he visited you six years ago.<eos> Which is when he left his safety deposit key with you, didn't he?<eos> A safety deposit key we just retrieved from the bank, and we were able to lift a clean fingerprint belonging to you off the key fob.<eos> Which implicates you in his murder, unless you can explain how your fingerprint got there.
- You're welcome to have a look.<eos> - Yes, we will, thank you.<eos> Sorry, but I have to ask, will this take much longer?<eos> Only my wife and daughter will be landing in half an hour.<eos> Well, I assure you that we won't keep you longer than necessary.
Once a month ¬£3,000 gets transferred to a building society account in England in the name of Kim Sweeney.<eos> Is Kim available?<eos> She's not well.<eos> She's been in bed all day.<eos> We'll be very brief, I assure you, thank you.
A princess.<eos> I wanted to marry her.<eos> But... She turned me down.<eos> Be smarter.<eos> Why did she turn you down?
And from these forts, we will defend the city, if necessary, to the death.<eos> We are ready for the heathen.<eos> Your Grace, you are the difference between failure and triumph.<eos> With your help, we can frustrate and defeat the enemy.<eos> I beg and beseech you.
Long may it continue.<eos> Salut.<eos> I have not seen you for a long time.<eos> I suppose you are bored with me.<eos> You are very amusing, Therese, but I was busy fighting the Northmen. Did nobody tell you?
Yeah, it does.<eos> But now I got to ask why.<eos> Your father has a rare genetic precursor that allowed us...<eos> No, that's how, not why.<eos> Your father never told you?
No, that's crazy.<eos> We have to stop them.<eos> I mean, you need to stop them.<eos> I could stimulate you.<eos> But what if I kill you?
That's how you used to do it?<eos> I'm a monster.<eos> I know.<eos> The things that I've done.<eos> There were others before you, I admit it... weaker women.
-Rojas.<eos> -Don Pablo.<eos> -Sir.<eos> -How have you been? Well, sir. How are you?<eos> I wasn't expecting you.
-In the flesh? -How are you, son?<eos> -Good?<eos> -Boss, we should get going.<eos> Let them see me. Let them see me.<eos> -I never thought I'd meet you in person. -How are you?
He DID come?<eos> No.<eos> Nor during the night?<eos> Oh... ..my son is not in the habit of visiting me during the night.<eos> I'm afraid you have to explain your questions, Inspector, or I warn you, I shall answer no more of them.
- His hands work...<eos> Both of them.<eos> I'm gonna take a shower.<eos> I put my top guys on your personal detail.<eos> They've been running full-spectrum surveillance on you, tailing you here, and your apartment, to your wife's place, and despite your concerns, there doesn't appear to be anyone following you.
You being straight with me?<eos> You just carrying a piece to be safe?<eos> There's nothing else going on, right?<eos> You're my girl.<eos> If there was something going on, I would tell you.
How long before you think it becomes mainstream?<eos> You planted that reporter.<eos> I did not.<eos> You're giving me far more credit than I deserve.<eos> If you bring the Justice Department into this, I'll come down hard on you for abuse of power, and that'll hurt you just as much as it hurts me.
Make it, uh, stronger.<eos> Say, uh, "The president took a bullet!" Make it personal.<eos> I'm sorry your husband got shot.<eos> But not enough to roll over.<eos> Oh, we're not asking you to.
I have no idea if they're clean.<eos> God damn me.<eos> On Easter Sunday, in front of my wife and these good people.<eos> Look at me, Byrd!<eos> I see you clearly, sir, exactly as they all see you.
In school, children learn French German and Germans learn French.<eos> And when they grow up, they kill. "<eos> I have to go.<eos> Thanks for everything.<eos> Before you leave, a favor, I beg you.
My return to France was difficult.<eos> But I try to survive.<eos> Enclosed is my letter to parents of Frantz, which, I know, you can not delete my crime, but it will help you understand my presence among you.<eos> I know that forgiveness is impossible.<eos> I beg you, answer me.
Bye.<eos> But, Clark, borrow a phone, and call me.<eos> - Okay?<eos> Bye.<eos> - Can I help you?
CCPN is reporting that Dr. Harrison Wells, the infamous founder of S.T.A.R. Labs who uncharacteristically has gone unseen for nearly four months is now a wanted man.<eos> These images and messages went up moments ago throughout Central City by Zoom.<eos> Have you seen channel 52?<eos> You're not safe here, Dr. Wells.<eos> Zoom's looking for you.
Fine, whatever.<eos> I just hope for your sake, the secret shopper isn't one of us.<eos> Wh... wait, wait.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Pssh. I ain't even gonna tell you.
Medically, other than the breast implants, it's too soon to even consider another procedure.<eos> I'd be irresponsible in advising you otherwise, and no reputable physician will operate on you again without at least six months of intensive therapy.<eos> Can I go back to being a guy?<eos> Again, the implants, that's not a problem.<eos> But beyond that, to the best of my knowledge, there is no procedure that will completely restore you back to your former self.
I'm proud he's my friend.<eos> And you threw him out!<eos> I hate you!<eos> Mr. Mars?<eos> I've been Waiting for you.
That's the key.<eos> The government doesn't even know what it has.<eos> And you have to have the right questions, too.<eos> You can call...<eos> I warned you!
Not unless you can get me a hotel room downtown for the next month.<eos> My company is putting me at the Redbrick Lodge and Seafood Hut.<eos> Ugh. My key is a fish.<eos> We have a room... we have a room available.<eos> I overheard you, sorry... we have a room.
Thank you.<eos> I know that couldn't have been easy.<eos> Cam, i swear to god --<eos> Okay, okay. You're right.<eos> I should have consulted you first.
I know.<eos> You're mad. And lonely.<eos> Wouldn't you rather be mad and not lonely?<eos> Maybe.<eos> So what's holding you back?
I will have to get back to you on that.<eos> Showing us that even as the city is torn apart by this volatile situation, there is always room for a hero.<eos> Nice piece.<eos> Just a hack blogger looking for an angle.<eos> Still, it is why I hand-picked you to be the representative for the Atlanta P.D.
I've had your back.<eos> I've vouched for you from day one.<eos> I said you wouldn't be anything like your father.<eos> You're suspended until further notice.<eos> I'm telling you, it's been two days and the kid's absolutely fine.
Those are not steps you take in a crisis you plan to be over in 48 hours.<eos> You're right.<eos> I had the containers and the phone companies on hold from day one.<eos> What are you accusing me of, being prepared?<eos> I'm accusing you of knowing more than you let on.
I'm nowhere near having a vaccine,<eos> - and you know it.<eos> - I said you were working on one.<eos> That's the only reason they're protecting you.<eos> Look, as long as they think they have something to gain, they'll keep you safe after I go.
They're part of another group.<eos> They call themselves -- I know who they are.<eos> Hey, asshole, how about a smile?<eos> This -- This is nothing.<eos> We've been letting you off easy.
(Sami:) Easy, easy.<eos> (Patrik:) Take the towing rope.<eos> (Sami:) Okay.<eos> (Sami:) Guide it a bit.<eos> (Patrik:) Wait, I am going to pass you.
I'm sorry.<eos> Dr. Daniel Charles, Chicago Med.<eos> Man, they sure are going after us these days, aren't they?<eos> You out on bail?<eos> I mean, why are they even charging you in the first place?
No, we're gonna earn money and take ourselves out.<eos> It's 2016.<eos> Love it.<eos> Be our own Armenian nightclub promoters.<eos> Grandpa, can I put you down as a reference?
Sheema, Dylan.<eos> In, out.<eos> Done.<eos> Sam.<eos> Don't make me take you down, Sam, you know I will!
That's what she would have wanted.<eos> Look, she loved that house.<eos> She didn't want to be buried next to strangers.<eos> You can go check if you want.<eos> I told you, I've got nothing to hide.
Caroline built a new road.<eos> It opened about eight months after I told her about Amber.<eos> It bypasses the village, so now all the tourist coaches and service trucks from Club Caribbean use that.<eos> Caroline was a true friend.<eos> When did Caroline promote you to her private secretary?
Now what on earth made you do that?<eos> Mr Hammond?<eos> A few months ago I interviewed for Caroline's replacement.<eos> Everybody on that panel knew I deserved the job.<eos> Yet still they snubbed you.
You all had motives to want Caroline dead.<eos> Mr Hammond, you felt so snubbed at work, you were prepared to betray your own country.<eos> While I think that Caroline probably had her suspicions about your betrayal, you didn't kill her.<eos> So, was it President Tromeur?<eos> We now know Caroline was blackmailing you.
Dad?<eos> It's poetic, returning to your childhood home.<eos> Jay.<eos> Don't do this.<eos> I'm begging you.
Hey.<eos> Rosie.<eos> Listen, just... Just listen to me, okay?<eos> I know that bamboo is not gonna fix this, okay?<eos> And I'm not gonna give you the whole Rosewood-Villa highlight reel because I know that you know that this worked better than I even thought it could. But I respect you enough that I am not gonna pursue something that you don't genuinely want.
Why are you here?<eos> Yoko<eos> This fucking... Tell him to be specific!<eos> Can you be more specific..?<eos> You wouldn't believe me even if I told you...
So you've heard of it.<eos> Well, every sailor's heard of it.<eos> Countless men have sailed into that storm looking for that bloody stone, but none have survived!<eos> If you don't like how I run my ship, you should've left when you had the chance.<eos> Now, move along before I string you up for mutiny.
In the bedlam, my brother was knocked unconscious.<eos> I managed to swim us to a few planks of wood.<eos> Providence did the rest.<eos> Young man, your brother is a hero.<eos> My ship will bring you to the king, who has offered a great reward for this stone.
You said your dad was dead.<eos> Uh, we were sort of dead to each other.<eos> Ever since Ruby put that book on my face, I've been having nightmares, but they happen while I'm awake.<eos> Where is The Necronomicon?<eos> I'll never tell you.
- You okay?<eos> - What's that?<eos> Another LSD moment?<eos> Oh, man.<eos> I told you, dude.
Well, I'll see you in a few seconds.<eos> Yeah, bye.<eos> All right, we got six more votes this morning. - Whoo!<eos> - We're never gonna close that gap.<eos> Well, on the less shitty side, people are really loving you and Charlie Baird.
You got here quick.<eos> Catherine called me.<eos> You were away.<eos> Yeah, serving the country.<eos> - I'm sorry about your mother. - Thank you.
Heidi, can I ask you something?<eos> Yeah, of course. Do girls not have balls?<eos> Girls do not have balls, no. So when a girl goes to scratch her balls how does that work?<eos> I just... don't understand what's at the bottom of a vagina.<eos> Do you want me to show you?
Do you think that part of you was getting uncomfortable with that closeness?<eos> You felt like you didn't deserve Todd's friendship and you wanted to somehow externalize that feeling into action?<eos> No, man, I think I'm just a dumb asshole.<eos> Can't it just be that?<eos> When you do bad things, you have something you can point to when people eventually leave you.
You have no idea, everything I do around here!<eos> - Half the kitchen staff is my family.<eos> - No.<eos> - Honestly, just--<eos> - I detest you!
This is Monica.<eos> Is it?<eos> Because apparently everything else that comes out of your mouth is a lie.<eos> Shit.<eos> Look, Richard, I totally understand if you're pissed at me, but please know that I tried as hard as I could to get him to tell you.
Excuse me?<eos> Letting your ex-boyfriend manipulate you 'cause you miss his sweet ass.<eos> Who told you that?<eos> Everyone knows that.<eos> You only do what your little bitch boyfriend manipulates you into do.
I've had it myself.<eos> Whatever he did... he had a good reason.<eos> But you don't know what that reason is?<eos> 'Cause if you do, you know I can help.<eos> Of course I don't. I would have told you.
Don't do this.<eos> It's too late.<eos> I have a celebration to plan and a new story to tell.<eos> Robert.<eos> I've told you, Bernard.
Because Zamani works for the CIA.<eos> That's impossible.<eos> We knew they were interested in him.<eos> That's why we stepped up our efforts on him, but... we didn't think they'd move so fast.<eos> If I had noticed anything, I would have told you immediately.
It's big and it's urgent.<eos> We need to meet quickly in Paris.<eos> Give me a date. I'll book tickets and a room at the Hilton.<eos> Friday?<eos> My assistant will contact you for details.
These are the questions that I do not ever want to ask.<eos> And unless we have an understanding, protocols, a system, these are things I need to know to protect you.<eos> I am trying to protect you.<eos> And it's awful that I have to do this, that we have to do this, but this is where we are now.<eos> A year from now, you will be a free man and you can rejoin the living and you can cavort with anyone you want, anywhere you want, in any way that you want, and I guarantee that I will never, ever interrupt you.
And he has a few questions for you About the murder of grigory mishkin.<eos> Oh, get lost, ivan.<eos> If the cops can't touch me, what are you guys going to do? Ah.<eos> Diplomatic immunity.<eos> It is like a soft fur coat that keeps you warm and cozy.
They were not in contact with the terrorists for more than nine months?<eos> They did not appear?<eos> Monsieur Labarthe, not all want the hostages released.<eos> There are obstructionist forces ...<eos> The Secretary of State will meet you.
Clement var i bilen?<eos> -Gav the images to the media?<eos> -Yes.<eos> -By the where they would lead you to?<eos> -Getting. A doctor must look at you.
Of course.<eos> Funny thing about tornadoes, they just drop out of the sky, like some random act you got no control over.<eos> A lot of things do that to us.<eos> Yeah, they sure do.<eos> Hey, um... thank you for today.
I'm going to get in trouble in that car.<eos> Oh, I hear you.<eos> I've been wanting to test-drive one of those.<eos> Please, stop by.<eos> - He'll take you for a spin.
We're headed to Ratwater.<eos> Mom, no.<eos> Make the kid watch.<eos> Hey.<eos> I remember you now.
- Who?<eos> - Preacher.<eos> What'd he say?<eos> What'd he say?<eos> What'd he say to you?
We were lied to.<eos> All along... lies.<eos> Odin, you have experienced a terrible loss.<eos> Your entire family... gone.<eos> Let God help you.
Have it ready for you tomorrow.<eos> I know you.<eos> Hey, Mister!<eos> Mom!<eos> - I remember you now.
Except, except, that I am extremely committed.<eos> I care. I'm a hard worker.<eos> I just wanna help.<eos> Hmm, that's refreshing.<eos> I, I could, uh, I could make pharmacy runs for you, pick up your prescriptions.
But I found out that there is so much love in this world out there for the taking,<eos> and you, the people of National City, you helped me.<eos> You let me be who I'm meant to be.<eos> You gave me back to myself.<eos> You made me stronger than I ever thought possible, and I love you for that.
Yeah.<eos> Half of what I made tonight.<eos> Just remember, never wear that mask outside the ring.<eos> You already told me that.<eos> I'm telling you again.
Where's Baylor?<eos> I got this.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Meet me at the river.<eos> I will never tell you.
I didn't see any leering.<eos> Oh, yeah, he was leering.<eos> He was eating cookies at me.<eos> How do you eat a cookie "at" someone?<eos> I'd show you, but it'd freak you out.
Your princess awaits.<eos> Thanks for letting her sleep it off.<eos> I didn't let her do anything.<eos> She called me a whore, threw up and passed out.<eos> Sorry, she's just real upset about you and her Dad.
‚ô™ But that's not it ‚ô™ ‚ô™ 'Cause bi's legit ‚ô™<eos> ‚ô™ Whether you're a he or a she ‚ô™<eos> ‚ô™ We might be a perfect fit ‚ô™<eos> ‚ô™ And one more thing ‚ô™<eos> ‚ô™ I tell you what ‚ô™
Okay.<eos> For starters, I was conceived on a cruise ship.<eos> I think my mom must've had some, I don't know, bad lobster.<eos> Because the second she felt the sperm enter the egg, she got sick.<eos> In my narrative, I pictured you as, like, the funny singing raccoon.
A smile for my arm, a fair trade.<eos> - Can you tell me where there's work to be had?<eos> - Boss's office over yonder.<eos> - How about a kiss instead, then?<eos> - How about I smack you with this suitcase?
Hey!<eos> Talk to him, lass.<eos> Say something to make him smile.<eos> You're going to get better.<eos> We're looking out for you.
I'm sorry. No, missus.<eos> I don't reckon how I'm eager to do this.<eos> What's the matter?<eos> Don't you like me?<eos> Oh, aye. I like you right enough.
Ever fought in a war?<eos> Ever marched behind a general who's inept?<eos> One bullet in the general's back can save a whole army. So.<eos> It's for the good of the rest.<eos> Anything else to say before I march you off in irons?
Anything I can help you with?<eos> I come and see her regular, like.<eos> Why don't you come and see me?<eos> You might prefer it.<eos> I'd do you for a shilling six.
If you want any of my investment, you'll not stand in my way.<eos> No amount of money is worth letting you harm these folk. You hear me?<eos> You really want to start a war with these shanty folk?<eos> What you do to one... a hundred others will know by tomorrow.<eos> Sir, perhaps we can escort you to your carriage?
They won't listen to me.<eos> The grey, old men?<eos> The men with moustaches?<eos> They hate me.<eos> - They do not hate you.
She was mine last night and that's what I needed.<eos> And you came in and you cockblocked me so hard. I told you I didn't need a wingman, okay?<eos> You don't know when to shut up.<eos> Talking about "Little genius"?<eos> She liked you because of "Little genius." I brought this up, immediately, she likes you.
We're not talking about some Internet troll hiding behind a screen name.<eos> No, we're talking about Kim Charles.<eos> Kim Charles?<eos> What, the whack job?<eos> No, Kim Charles, the former MI6 agent who sued you for stealing her brainwashing idea.
They also said Doyle had a lot of blood on him when they got here, but aside from the cut on his forehead, they found no major wounds.<eos> So where did all that blood come from?<eos> - Exactly.<eos> - No, I said I'm fine.<eos> We can't tell if there's any internal bleeding or head trauma unless we take you into the hospital.
Okay, put the pieces together, okay?<eos> Think about me.<eos> If tomorrow comes, they're gonna put a bullet in my head. Bang! Bang, bang, bang, bang!<eos> My people are waiting for me nearby, but a leader is only good if they're present to lead.<eos> If tomorrow comes and I die, who's gonna tell Jones to bring you back from the hotel and bring you to 2044 like I did... will do... for you?
The mask... mask...<eos> Until the world comes crashing down around our heads, we have to believe it's over.<eos> All of it.<eos> I guess you really know what you're doing here.<eos> I'll leave you to it.
This is Calista.<eos> Fuller, Calista.<eos> It's a work buddy.<eos> It was a Retro Girl action figure, wasn't it?<eos> What tipped you off?
Is everyone okay?<eos> That was a-a strange experience.<eos> Couple broken ribs, bruised sternum- - I can't believe I'm saying this, but you'll be fine.<eos> Slimy but fine.<eos> I already told you, if a genius doctor says I'm okay, I'm okay.
Got to return the satellite dishes.<eos> I'll grab the van around back.<eos> Okay, Ralph.<eos> We should go home. Oh.<eos> Thank you for today.
Something I can help you with, Pat?<eos> You know, I've been thinking.<eos> And maybe we should go ashore.<eos> Ye... yeah, that'd be great.<eos> You get a chance to have a peek-a-boo, see that I'm talking to you straight.
But how can I do that if my ministers lie and plot and hide the truth from me?<eos> You have prevented me from doing my duty.<eos> You have hampered and bamboozled the proper functioning of the Crown.<eos> How could you?<eos> My own late father valued you greatly.
- Getting through to you.<eos> I picked up the phone to you just after nine this morning. It's now gone midday.<eos> Oh, don't exaggerate. But, yes, I know, it is infuriating.<eos> Fire away.<eos> You asked me to come up with some figures for you with regard to Aureole. Although I'm numerically dyslexic, runs in the family I'm afraid, like the high forehead. I have done the sums, see if this helps you with your decision.
It is a betrayal of friendship.<eos> And an unpatriotic, treacherous, cowardly assault by the individualistic left.<eos> - As regards the friendship...<eos> - Clearly there is none.<eos> I accepted this commission because I admired you and I came through the experience admiring you even more.
My confidence in Sir Anthony is complete.<eos> And I know he will lead the country on to great achievements, but it would be useless to pretend that either he or any of those successors who may one day follow him in office, will ever, for me,<eos> And for whose wise guidance, during the early years of my reign, I shall always be so profoundly grateful.<eos> Hear, hear!<eos> I will remember you always for your magnanimity, your courage at all times.
Who doesn't like a red velvet penis?<eos> Diabetic lesbians?<eos> Why don't you put that in the kitchen?<eos> And no sneaking a lick.<eos> You know, I can't tell you how happy I am for Marjorie.
what does that mean?<eos> Speak softly... your father will overhear.<eos> Does this mean my marriage to Sanjay's been postponed again.<eos> Look, Kaveri.<eos> I've told you a thousand times.
Sanjay, listen to me please.<eos> Can I come in?<eos> Sorry, I...<eos> I'll finish my exercise.<eos> Sorry for disturbing you at this hour.
Why didn't you?<eos> Why didn't you punch him?<eos> Why didn't you punch him?<eos> If I had punched him... it would've ended everything.<eos> And... you wouldn't get a second chance... to say sorry, I love you.
Did you drink all this alone?<eos> Surprising.<eos> Come on, I'll get you some tea at the police station.<eos> There's a bit of improvement.<eos> I'm discharging you only because you're asking.
Couple of 'em even helped me close a case.<eos> See, the problem is those are the ones that are so good, you forget that the guy you're working with isn't a cop.<eos> I hear you, but I'm gonna tell you what John McGarrett told me the first time I brought in a CI.<eos> He said, "Once they're yours, they're yours for life."<eos> So I'm telling you that Kamekona's more than just a CI to me.
You're in Wayward Pines. WELCOME TO WAYWARD PINES WHERE PARADISE IS HOME<eos> Attention, citizens of Wayward Pines.<eos> Due to recent rebel activity, curfew will begin in 25 minutes.<eos> Where are we going?<eos> I told you.
- Transfer.<eos> Get this out. - [moans]<eos> - Airway's intact.<eos> Let's get him off that backboard.<eos> Mr. Blevins, we're gonna roll you onto your right side.
You're incarcerated.<eos> Can't it be both?<eos> Helen, don't worry about me.<eos> I'm tougher than you think I am.<eos> And I owe this to you... After what I put you through.
Well, I don't think this is the appropriate context. To discuss my book.<eos> No, please.<eos> We're interested.<eos> See, the thing is, professor solloway, When we heard that you were coming to teach, We were all a little nervous.<eos> I mean, you have to understand. That your reputation precedes you, And I guess I would just feel a lot safer.
I hope you pay for what you did.<eos> The diamonds.<eos> My diamonds.<eos> We gave them to the Americans. You'll never get them back.<eos> I'm telling you, so you'll suffer.
Sir John!<eos> Why aren't you dancing... with Lady Flora?<eos> I believe she is your preferred partner.<eos> You never could take champagne, Drina.<eos> Ma'am, I did warn you.
You know, there's a drought.<eos> Right.<eos> I know what this is.<eos> What is it?<eos> I can't tell you.
You sure it's him?<eos> No mistake-- that's our man.<eos> Where is he now?<eos> Running late?<eos> Took you for a smaller guy.
Neither do I.<eos> That's what I'm trying to find out.<eos> What I want to know from you is was he suicidal.<eos> Did he appear to you to be suicidal?<eos> - I warned you.
I'm just really glad he decided to tell the truth.<eos> I'll bet you are.<eos> Don't say another word.<eos> Am I to understand that Kyle Miller took ownership of the drugs, and you didn't notify us?<eos> I'm notifying you now.
Hang on a second.<eos> Do I need a lawyer here?<eos> We are just trying to understand.<eos> 'Cause it sounds like I'm being accused of something.<eos> No one's accusing you of anything, but you are entitled to have a lawyer with you if you want.
- This isn't a social call.<eos> - Oh, hey, dude.<eos> Doesn't mean it can't become one, right?<eos> You never know where the night's gonna take you.<eos> Did last night take you to the pool?
Possibly a brilliant one.<eos> - Wouldn't you agree?<eos> - I mean...<eos> There's a lot of smart people at Borns Tech.<eos> That's very kind of you to say, especially since they fired you.
I don't have a boyfriend.<eos> No?<eos> You don't have a boyfriend?<eos> So you're just fucking Donald Cooperman, then?<eos> How's that working out for you?
You know, a good priest can carry the day.<eos> I've been dismissed from the clerical state.<eos> What do they think you did?<eos> There are only five offenses that merit excommunication.<eos> Telling you what Ryan Larson talked about in the confession is one of the five.
Where were you when you learned that Lobos had escaped?<eos> I was in the van with Felipe Lobos when we were ambushed.<eos> You survived the shot to the chest.<eos> - Two, Agent Donovan. LANCE:<eos> Your vest protected you, but I've been thinking, why didn't they shoot you in the head?
Can I talk to you?<eos> Raymond is OK. He's in the military hospital.<eos> He'll be there for a while.<eos> You can visit him soon.<eos> - l already told you?
I need your help. Ms. Swan. Nice to see you made it back from the Underworld.<eos> I'm not the only one who made it back. Hades is in Storybrooke.<eos> I have to stop him.<eos> So I was hoping... you could tell me how to kill him.<eos> Well, even if I knew, why would I tell you?
Everything is allowed here.<eos> Feel free to apologize, scream, cry, complain, argue.<eos> Anything short of physical confrontation.<eos> - There goes my next thing.<eos> - Did I not tell you?
- Your therapy with Lorelai?<eos> - You don't want to miss that.<eos> - Oh, I stopped that a week ago.<eos> Oh, right. Right.<eos> - She didn't tell you? - No.
She looks so grown up, but she is still a kid.<eos> -She wants Rory to take her nose ring out.<eos> -I'll take it out.<eos> I hate that thing.<eos> She wants to go to Germany this summer. Did I tell you?
- We saw the e-mails between you both before Tosh came here.<eos> He wasn't supposed to be joining you, was he?<eos> You were intending to run the salvage operation yourself.<eos> But he didn't trust you to do it successfully.<eos> And then we find out, on the day your father was killed, he fired you from the family business.
I am the resurrection and the life.<eos> Whoever believes in me, even though he should die, shall come to life.<eos> And whoever is alive and believes in me shall never die.<eos> Thank you.<eos> "My dear Major Andr√©, I hope this letter finds you well.
And as a gentleman, I thought it only fitting that you should hear it before it becomes public.<eos> Oh, well, thank you very much for your concern.<eos> I wouldn't try that.<eos> Unless you want to go back to bleeding to death.<eos> I already took out the bullet, sewed you up as best I could.
She's a former Secret Service agent.<eos> Dabble in private investigations.<eos> Oh, boy. ‚ô™ ... love, give me diamonds ‚ô™<eos> Please don't.<eos> I'm begging you.
He even has plans for Quantico.<eos> But I don't have that option.<eos> Until the judge hands down my sentence...<eos> No, you're staying here.<eos> Look, I don't have the authority to-to do this, but I don't want you going anywhere until I tell you to.
I want a lawyer.<eos> Glad to call one.<eos> By the time he gets here, you'll be looking at homicide charges.<eos> You were hired by Brianna's ex-husband to help his divorce settlement, so, you illegally plant listening devices in her office, but instead of scandalous gossip to help his case, you overhear how much cash Brianna's moving and you think, "Hot damn, I've won the lottery."<eos> Now the guy you sold the score to is icing you out.
Jim was married, and neither one of us wanted to start a relationship with a lie.<eos> According to the e-mails, you two were planning a life together.<eos> But only after Jim got a divorce.<eos> You know, I can't believe you hacked me.<eos> Because I was trying to clear you of embezzlement.
I'm gonna try this again."<eos> [narrator] With their digital reconnection came a very analog reunion.<eos> But they've never talked about Marisa's deFOOing until now. ‚ô™‚ô™ When me and Jackie had you guys, we swore we were going to be the best parents in the world, you know?<eos> We tried so hard, and, you know, I think you've learned a lot, and I'm sure when you have a family, you know, you'll make your mistakes, but I think you'll do a lot better than me and your Mom did.<eos> I think both of you will.
Because I am meeting with him tonight to negotiate my terms of service to the king.<eos> - What?<eos> - Don't you see, my love?<eos> This is my opportunity to end this civil war, to be a peacemaker.<eos> I should have told you before, but I couldn't.
So that's how I've been measuring the time that I've got left, not in days or weeks...<eos> But beats.<eos> And if you think that this new-procedure thing can give me more than I currently have... then I'm all-in.<eos> I need four more patients for the trial.<eos> From what Doc Harrison has said about you,
Gandhi: In Arizona, oneofthe45states whereassistedsuicide isillegal, wemetHowardGlick.<eos> Hesuffersfromarare braindisordercalled frontotemporaldegeneration, orFTD.<eos> Ashisbraindeteriorates,<eos> Howardisrapidly losinghismemory andcognitiveabilities andwilleventually requireconstantcare.<eos> When they diagnosed you, what did you find out about the disease?
- Thank you, sir.<eos> We need to tell the American people how we're doing, and we need to get specific.<eos> Could one of you please find me something heavy to hit Mr. Wright with?<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm telling you.
Hey".<eos> Mom... Akira, this is Shilpa.<eos> Come in.<eos> Bless you... it's alright.<eos> Oh, sorry.. - It's okay. Bless you.
This diner gets called "not a restaurant" all the time.<eos> Hey, did they tell you to just bring Max, or was it more of a "bring whoever"?<eos> - Um...<eos> - I'll take that as a yes.<eos> I'd love to join you at Beak tomorrow night.
We did try.<eos> It didn't work.<eos> It didn't get us anywhere.<eos> We have the same exact fight over and over again, around in circles.<eos> I'm telling you... it's not working.
If you always eat take-out, then it becomes a habit.<eos> We worry about health issues, but it seems to be the growing trend.<eos> That's the thing.<eos> The young in India, they will tell you what pasta is all about.<eos> They can tell you what a burger is all about.
..and not just by Michelangelo. Botticelli is in here too, showing the Punishment of Korah, Dathan and Abiram, when God burns them up with invisible fire.<eos> And here's Perugino again, with Christ handing the keys of heaven to St Peter, and doing it so gracefully.<eos> So, on the lower level, there are all these impressive frescoes by other artists.<eos> And then, up above, there's Michelangelo.<eos> Together, they act as one space that encircles you with art and engulfs you in a dark religious storyline.
I've decided to close it.<eos> Really?<eos> Why?<eos> I don't know exactly, but it seems like the right thing to do.<eos> In that case, what if I buy you out?
Empty?<eos> What, like he's moved out?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Wait.<eos> When did she tell you about Renard?
She didn't infect anyone.<eos> She's still within the incubation period.<eos> You saved the town, Dr. Yedlin.<eos> You're a hero.<eos> Maybe they'll appreciate you for it.
About 30 miles away.<eos> Born and raised.<eos> It's a small town, you probably never heard of it.<eos> Just a dot on a map.<eos> If you run, they'll find you.
Yeah, I'm trying to break that habit.<eos> Why did you come here?<eos> What happened with Owen's sister?<eos> You're a friend of Owen Hunt's.<eos> I figured he would have told you.
He's a Monsoon, isn't he?<eos> Indeed he is.<eos> Do you remember Lady Arabella's nephew, Lord Porlock?<eos> My Lord.<eos> I haven't seen you since you were a boy.
- Mr Moffatt!<eos> Come this minute and make up a hand at whist!<eos> I hope my enthusiasm excuses my lack of skill, Lady Alexandrina.<eos> Not a bit.<eos> At your first mistake, I shall rap you on the knuckles with my fan.
Get rid of it.<eos> Mr. Churchill, Your Majesty.<eos> Your Majesty.<eos> The people have spoken.<eos> Your party has won the election, and as... as their Sovereign, I invite you to form a government in my name.
I know you didn't want them involved, but a murder changes things.<eos> These are for you.<eos> Get dressed.<eos> Got to go down to the precinct and answer some questions.<eos> A detective is on her way to pick you up.
Sammy Al Fayeed.<eos> Mr. Al Fayeed.<eos> Hi.<eos> Um, I know I've missed three weeks, but I-I'd love to take your class, if you don't mind.<eos> I'd love to have you.
No one's allowed to make outgoing calls.<eos> They even took my phone.<eos> I have to call her.<eos> She might think I'm not calling because they took me or something, por favor.<eos> I promise we're gonna get you home as soon as we can, okay?
But I'm Glenn.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Oh, he just has an air of authority about him.<eos> Anyway, if that's something you feel you can't do, I understand, and I wish you well.
Come, Lady Scatcherd.<eos> You were with him to the last.<eos> That is the best a wife can hope for.<eos> Mary, take Lady Scatcherd to her room.<eos> So, Louis, although you are now the baronet, your father spoke of you to me and... has left you... under my charge.
I'll come if it would be useful.<eos> - Will you wait while I fetch a coat?<eos> - Of course.<eos> Leaving, Mr Gazebee?<eos> When will we see you again?
Master Frank!<eos> Oh, Master Frank!<eos> Let me kiss your naughty little face!<eos> You're a sight for sore eyes, you are!<eos> And Lord knows my eyes have been sore since I last saw you!
The train will be in at three o'clock.<eos> Take Beatrice with you.<eos> How can Aunt De Courcy help?<eos> Frank's mind is made up.<eos> He won't be talked out of her now. I agree with you.
What is that?<eos> Well, statistics show that violence in the home is learned behavior.<eos> First you threaten to take my kid away.<eos> Now... Now you accuse me of beating him?<eos> I'm not accusing you of anything.
Hey, little dude!<eos> Oh, my gosh, i have missed you.<eos> We believe this family can work out something beneficial For this boy's future.<eos> You believe rightly, sir.<eos> You believe rightly, and thank you.
But i am completely against it.<eos> You are?<eos> It's already causing problems.<eos> Julio was late last week because of your little home visit.<eos> what's next? Well, i'll tell you.
So what?<eos> I bought the gun.<eos> I needed it for protection.<eos> My first night here, some asshole put a knife to my neck And stole my wallet, took all the cash i had on me, Almost slit my throat.<eos> Okay, you say some person stole all your cash, But when we picked you up from the airport, You hadthison you.
What choices have i got?<eos> You can go to court here in the united states On a charge of first-degree murder With special circumstances, which is a death-penalty case.<eos> And you can await your execution At the very posh correctional facility at san quentin.<eos> Or, mr. Kemp, you can tell us the truth.<eos> You can agree to testify against claire branson in court, And we will return you to the u.K. For trial.
- Do you have their number?<eos> - Uh, no.<eos> Um, can... can you give to me?<eos> Sorry, I'm, uh...<eos> I think I'm losing you.
If you will write down exactly what you did to cushing,<eos> We won't charge Brie or her boyfriend with prostitution.<eos> She will not be branded For the rest of her life as a sex offender.<eos> Your little girl will get a second chance.<eos> Or you can ask Brie's lawyer to defend you For murder in the first degree, and then consider what this story will sound like On the day that your daughter takes the stand.
Find King Charles and bring him home safely.<eos> We will do everything in our power to find your son and crush these traitors.<eos> The king shall be in your debt.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I thank you.
Buzz?<eos> Come on, Jerry, please.<eos> It's been nine months.<eos> I need to see him.<eos> Dwight don't want to visit you, Wildred.
Has expired on the number of times you knocked Jennifer around.<eos> Yes, her statement about the watch, taken with the partials, and denying your alibi...<eos> Very bad.<eos> So the terms of our conversation have changed...<eos> Because two murders doesn't just jerk you out of Kern and throw you into Pelican Bay.
I mean, someone must have messed with my solution.<eos> Could have been anyone, really.<eos> They're all jealous of you.<eos> It was probably Dean BoxMunsch.<eos> I mean, she wanted to make sure her and her gray pubes had you all to herself.
Nothing.<eos> What did Owen tell you about me?<eos> Meredith...<eos> She said, um, she's my sister, and she told me...<eos> She told you about Megan.
No, no, no, wait, go back.<eos> - What was what?<eos> - What?<eos> That thing Axl said.<eos> Oh, that's when he was telling you how much he loves you.
Come.<eos> Be not afraid.<eos> I know the horrors behind you.<eos> And I know all too well the horrors that lie in front of you.<eos> And I would spare you all to come.
[Voice breaking] But I thought you were excited about the move.<eos> I am.<eos> [Sighs]<eos> At least, I want to be, but I just... you know, when I think about being gone,<eos> I think about not seeing you both every day.
Who's we?<eos> Oh, man.<eos> You feel the love now, Ricky?<eos> Oh, uh, absolutely, Coach Payton.<eos> I did not expect you.
Yes.<eos> - Uh, great.<eos> - How many of you are having a hard time hearing Stewart?<eos> Could you speak up a little bit?<eos> I-I think the panel's having a hard time hearing you.
Fine, pour it.<eos> Ladies, to Al Gore, who also finished second in his election, but went on to grow a really nice beard and alert us all to the dangers of climate change.<eos> - To Al Gore.<eos> - To Al Gore.<eos> - Mmm. - Told you.
I'm out.<eos> I'm done.<eos> I said enough.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I told you I would page you.
- I'm gay.<eos> - So am I!<eos> Sticking my dick in a friend's vagina doesn't make me not gay.<eos> Are you hearing this, Raul?<eos> This is why I didn't want to tell you...
That's how most superheroes start out...<eos> Mild-mannered weaklings, and that's you!<eos> Wow, thanks.<eos> Relax. It's all to maximize your transformative arc.<eos> If I agree with you, will you leave me alone?
The last team to find me here under the watchful eye of Michel may be eliminated.<eos> Let's go, Brodie!<eos> Whoo-hoo! Oh! 10-point landing.<eos> How did Korey pass you?<eos> I'll tell you in a little bit, man.
- No, because I wasn't questioning Mr. Locke.<eos> Is that standard practice?<eos> If we arrest someone, it's a custodial interrogation, and we read them their rights.<eos> If we show up, and they want to tell us about the crime they committed, we don't stop them.<eos> But Peter Florrick made you.
Oh, God.<eos> I envy that.<eos> It's so romantic to just know after only a few months.<eos> Oh!<eos> I can tell you, he definitely knows all my secrets.
With the equality of its citizens<eos> In 1789.<eos> You must be inspector rousseau.<eos> Indeed.<eos> I'm gonna tell you what my wife told you. Your badge means nothing over here.
I beg your pardon?<eos> You're a sergeant, you're often desk-bound.<eos> Difficult to effect any real change, though not for the Midnight Ranger.<eos> Perhaps you thought an alliance with him was an attractive idea.<eos> Look, no one is accusing you of anything, okay?
Not at all.<eos> Oh, we'll see about that.<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> Your security detail has been repurposed, Howard.<eos> From now on, my men, Agents Murphy and Costas, will protect you.
Have you gathered the press?<eos> No.<eos> No?<eos> In a second, I'm gonna close the door, and you're going to yell at me and try to undo something that can not be undone.<eos> But I'm going to explain myself, and you're going to realize that I did not betray you.
Aw, maybe nobody saw you.<eos> No, five people saw me.<eos> But you're right.<eos> High school is better 'cause only three of them made fun of me.<eos> Well, no one's making fun of you at dinner.
That is my max.<eos> Special Agent Gibbs.<eos> Senator.<eos> Thanks for coming.<eos> Special Agent DiNozzo get you up to speed?
Dr. Holt, Dr. Cascade needs you in the E.R.<eos> Something about a joke that you told him.<eos> He can remember the punch line, but he can't remember the setup.<eos> Plus,I 'mtrying to date that hot slice of lady pie, Chanel, and everybody suddenly thinks I'm the Green Meanie.<eos> Dr. Holt, Zayday needs you in the consultation room.
Mr. Clark, at what address did you live on the date of July 30, 1985?<eos> Same address that I lived at on February 17, 1985, and January 27, 1985, and May 1, 1985, and every other date that you've asked me about.<eos> Could you please repeat the address?<eos> 2824 DePue Drive, Richardson, Texas.<eos> And did Mr. MacMillan visit you at your residence at 2824 DePue Drive on July 30, 1985?
And why had he been there before?<eos> Because we were business partners.<eos> And friends?<eos> Yeah, and friends.<eos> So, when he visited you on July 30, 1985, at 2824 DePue Drive, was that as a business partner or a friend?
The ship's keeping him in stasis.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> Oh.<eos> My name is Oliver Queen and my preference is to not break your arm, so I want you to calm down and tell us what happened to your team.<eos> You wouldn't believe me even if I told you.
Don't look at me.<eos> I left my gun on the ship like a good little Boy Scout.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Who are you people?<eos> I believe the Queen is waiting for you in her bedroom.
But alas, he wanted kids, and she didn't, and so they broke up.<eos> And in a moment of weakness,<eos> Xo slept with his nemesis, Esteban.<eos> - And, well, this happened.<eos> - I warned you.
I need a unit at 53rd and 7th.<eos> I saw you on the news.<eos> You're working with the Federales to investigate Zane Cannon's death.<eos> You mean his murder.<eos> Well, I mean, uh, we know that Zane, uh, was in contact with you about a business proposition and that you were in contact with him just hours before his un-untimely demise.
To get him to lead you to your brother.<eos> That way you could kill El Oso and take over the family business, much in the same way you took over the family bed.<eos> And when Zane couldn't get a second meeting with El Oso, he was a loose end, so you killed him.<eos> I did not kill Zane.<eos> We know that Zane called you from a burner phone hours before he was killed.
I've got "VICE" here with me.<eos> We wanted to talk a little bit about gay rights, religious freedom, same-sex marriage. This has all been a hot-button issue for Americans.<eos> Why are more states proposing that they have religious freedom laws in their states?<eos> Because we've seen it around the country in a number of situations, businesses targeted, saying, you will provide goods and services to a marriage ceremony that you believe to be religious, and if you don't do it,<eos> we're gonna take your business from you or drive you from business.
Look, I'm telling you, all right, I looked everywhere.<eos> All right, I had to borrow a master key.<eos> Oh, whatever.<eos> Why won't you trust me?<eos> I'm telling you, there's something off about that girl.
Well, having a support person in his life really seems to be making a difference.<eos> Yo, uncle!<eos> Hey, listen, man, uh, look, I need some dough.<eos> You already owe me for the plane ticket and the cash I floated you.<eos> Look, you know I wouldn't ask you if it wasn't important, huh? - [Stavros] You in trouble?
When?<eos> Last night. You did this?<eos> I didn't have a choice.<eos> I was on my way to hw. Somebody's setting you up.<eos> Who let you in?
Are you okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I mean, do I have to take a shot from a girl's mouth to have a good time?<eos> No, you don't have to, but no one would judge you if you did.
So?<eos> Big deal.<eos> You were still wearing 'em!<eos> Look, man, that was a long time ago, all right?<eos> I'm not gonna do anything to mess up you and Heather.
Said he wanted to hold out for better prices.<eos> Same thing he used to say when I used to bring over the Girl Scout cookies.<eos> Well, let's take a look at that truck, huh?<eos> Look at that rock. Whoo!<eos> Guess that's what Kenny's Marriott money gets you, huh?
Oh! So follow him.<eos> Oh, no!<eos> I told you.<eos> It's probably just a coincidence.<eos> Speed up a little, see if he stays with you.
I'm lonely.<eos> That's why I asked you to move in with me.<eos> Tired of eating alone.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> Well, I can't make you.
Charles was charged with the violent murder of his fianc√©e, Vickie Moran, in 2005.<eos> But after a highly publicized trial, he was acquitted and released.<eos> Frank.<eos> The arrest was made earlier this evening after authorities found the suspected murder weapon, an unregistered Remington 2020, in his car.<eos> I told you...
Even when we disagreed, there was always love between us.<eos> Jared, a co-worker of yours stated that your mother humiliated you in front of a woman you were dating.<eos> Do you recall this event?<eos> I do not.<eos> Let me remind you.
This is a big life decision for me!<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Or care, to be honest.<eos> Beg the church to take you back or go sleep on the street, but I'm not gonna be the one to take care of you right now.<eos> After all that I've given you?
Are you with Wes?<eos> No, we had a fight.<eos> Find him and get everyone to the house right away.<eos> Why?<eos> I'll explain to you in person.
The principal, the administration.<eos> T.J. hasn't spoken in a year.<eos> - [scoffs] - His grades are failing.<eos> And now he's violent in school.<eos> Look, I'm telling you.
Rajvir Singh, you just said that she dropped some hints.<eos> What kind of hints?<eos> She was being very frank, smiling at me, touching me while talking to me.<eos> Oh... you've finished?<eos> You said she was smiling during the conversation and touching you at times.
Is that what you want to prove?<eos> - No.<eos> I don't need to prove that.<eos> But why are you getting irritated?<eos> I was only congratulating you on your wedding but you're getting agitated.
No, he knows.<eos> He can just be a bit of a problem child, that's all.<eos> Hey, come on, Callen, let it go.<eos> It's not worth it.<eos> I don't know anything about JD-X, and you know more than anybody, if I knew, I wouldn't tell you.
Then change it cos it's a bad idea.<eos> They'll put you in alien detention or they'll kill you and out of the two, killing is probably better.<eos> - Look, will you tell Antoine...<eos> - Oh, forget Antoine.<eos> I'm telling you.
Those are bite marks.<eos> Flesh torn out with teeth.<eos> This has Bennet Drake's seat.<eos> It was.<eos> As I understand it, the doctors have passed you fit, inspector.
What are you doing?<eos> Hey, what are you doing?<eos> Didn't want to keep this view all to yourself, did you?<eos> You come any closer, I'm gonna jump.<eos> Were it not for the fact that you might hurt someone down there, I would let you.
It's here!<eos> The baby?<eos> Well, a baby.<eos> Oh, good, our goober driver's here.<eos> Aren't I suffering enough to get the diner back from you two?
Pretty, shut up.<eos> If I recall, you were late coming to the party.<eos> How did you see that?<eos> Never laid eyes on them before in my life.<eos> They seemed quite adamant that they knew you.
Come on.<eos> Those guys were precise, professional, in constant agreement.<eos> We can't even agree on whose turn it is to make dinner.<eos> Not it.<eos> I can't argue with you, man.
Well, I'm sure, wherever he is, you are foremost in his mind.<eos> Who are you?<eos> I'm... I'm a colleague of his.<eos> My name is also Martin.<eos> He never mentioned you.
I still don't understand.<eos> The last thing I remember was getting off the train. Everything else is a blur.<eos> I wouldn't worry about that, Mr. Ness.<eos> After our investigation, we concluded you were kidnapped by an imposter, some idiot posing as you trying to bring down Capone.<eos> The gentleman who was impersonating you was trying to do the right thing.
They're not just dreams, they must be memories of that life.<eos> More and more people are getting powers.<eos> Okay, so how do we stop this?<eos> I mean, is there any stopping it even?<eos> If Alchemy could reach you at CCPD, he could probably reach you from anywhere, right?
How the hell did they know we were here?<eos> Up, up!<eos> On the line.<eos> I'm here to learn something, man, not just get beat up.<eos> I told you.
Look, guys, I didn't believe in genies, either, okay? Until my life fell apart.<eos> I found my girlfriend in bed with my roommate, and then I stayed with my mom, and my mom accidentally threw out the duffel bag with my 250 G's!<eos> You know, and when I think that things, they... they can't get any worse, I found out that Lars got his head lopped off, and now that genie... that crazy, evil genie... is after me, man!<eos> I know it! Okay, Harlin, I'm gonna have to get you off the crazy train that you're riding on right now.<eos> Yeah, we know that the shipment got screwed up and... and you suspected that Lars double-crossed you.
Fuck 'em, do what you want."<eos> That happened!<eos> - Did it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Who knows with you?
And I--I think that most people may not know who that is.<eos> So I think that how iconic she was, and the voice and everything, you kind of have to shove that in people's faces for them to get it.<eos> - You could have gone so much bigger with her.<eos> - Punk took my voice away.<eos> My voice kept cracking, and I was going in and out during Diana Vreeland. - Well, we could hear you perfectly.
His arm's caught in a machine!<eos> We're gonna need a small airbag!<eos> Message received.<eos> Severide.<eos> Hey, Dawson, we'll be there in 2 minutes! Set off your PASS device so we can find you!
I knew you would make this about The Light.<eos> I am losing my fucking mind here.<eos> They won't go away until you find what they're asking of you.<eos> Get out!<eos> And if you don't find out... They'll destroy you.
He now declares that he neither can nor will do anything for himself.<eos> Good situations have been offered more than once, for which by a fortnight's work he might have qualified himself, but he will do nothing except drink and make us all wretched.<eos> Tell me where it is!<eos> There is no more money, Branwell, not for you.<eos> I beg you to recognise that you are ill.
Where is this guy?<eos> Where is he?<eos> ! What, no alcohol swab this time?<eos> No need.<eos> This stuff will kill you in about 12 seconds.
You're all right?<eos> I'll be waiting for you, hero.<eos> What of your kings' power now?<eos> They've given you a burden you cannot hope to bear.<eos> I told you before.
You will see something happening today... that will bring us the proof of what we think.<eos> - Santa Madonna, another murder? "No, it will be a good thing.<eos> - Do you want to bet?<eos> - Do not!<eos> I Dont play with you. - I'll tell you anyway.
I just want to die every day.<eos> I can't.<eos> No, do not-- I can't, I can't, Abby.<eos> Don't do that.<eos> I'm telling you, don't come here.
I don't know. All right. Let's get her to CT.<eos> Can I go with her?<eos> Once she's conscious, you can.<eos> But we have to take her for some scans, all right? We'll be back.<eos> I love you, k!
All right, you go, I'll stay.<eos> Worst case, get drunk, call an uber.<eos> I've had enough people in my life trying to fix things for me, you know, and I'm tired of it.<eos> I get that. I do, but you see my point?<eos> I need the E.R. and the surgical departments to work well together and if they don't respect you...
She's untouchable.<eos> I've been trying for years.<eos> Barbara: I fucked up.<eos> I slept with Lucas.<eos> Julia: I warned you.
Are you ready for this one?<eos> Dotties' daughter Anne's getting divorced.<eos> Hate to say "I told you so," but I told you so.
Especially for Kyle, losing the only father he ever knew.<eos> - So you adopted Kyle?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Can I ask why you didn't keep me and Jude?<eos> Didn't they tell you?
Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> So it's really good to see you and Mat back together again.<eos> And...<eos> I'm sorry I was hard on you about Nick.
And the others?<eos> Satellite feeds picked up Price's jet touching down in St. Louis.<eos> Our guess is she's headed to the White House to meet with Shaw.<eos> I've diverted all teams to that location.<eos> Once we have them in custody, we'll get you on the air to address the people.
How are we feeling?<eos> I understand all of this must be confusing to you, maybe even a little overwhelming.<eos> What you guys are doing is against the law.<eos> It's sneaky and conniving.<eos> No one forced you to sign on the dotted line, customer 152.
About Lucifer.<eos> All right.<eos> I'm listening.<eos> Oh, I'm not gonna tell you.<eos> I'm gonna show you.
For your viewing pleasure.<eos> See you on the other side.<eos> You're late.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Elliott didn't tell you?
- What are you doing here?<eos> - I need to talk to you.<eos> - It's not a good time.<eos> - Now.<eos> Thank you for today.
What makes you so sure he's gonna show up?<eos> Don't underestimate yourself, Robert.<eos> One way or another, I'm confident Kirk will come.<eos> I'll have his head, and you'll end up in the Oval Office, where you can pay off your debt to me with a full pardon.<eos> You expect me to pardon you.
The only way you're gonna get that yellow jacket is when you know who's throwing you the ball. Are you fucking crazy?<eos> - See what happen when I speak?<eos> - The Hall of Fame is way out of reach. Joe:<eos> Rick, don't sell yourself short, man.<eos> You got at least three good seasons left in you.
- I think you got to go back to Malibu.<eos> - No, I'm...<eos> I'm not going back.<eos> - Okay, you're going back. - No, we've already gone... through this before.<eos> - I'm telling you.
There... Take some from the locker.<eos> Keys!<eos> - Another chance. - There is no point in talking any more.<eos> - Do you realise that you have all but killed me?<eos> I just wrote a report about you to our company. In my opinion, We are not for you!
Among other things, I don't have the strength for this anymore.<eos> Are you finished?<eos> It's like this...<eos> If you don't want to fly, it's your decision.<eos> You can leave any time you want, but... One flight will do, because a fool vouched for you.
The Agency is walking a minefield with an ally.<eos> Clay, the Germans think that I took losava.<eos> And the Romanian blame is equally bullshit.<eos> So what exactly are you doing here?<eos> Well, if you still had your security clearance, I might tell you.
- Then why did you run?<eos> - I thought it was her family after me!<eos> - You are lying!<eos> - He is right!<eos> I saw you. I know it was you.
I don't like carrots.<eos> I don't like carrots.<eos> But I like Mom.<eos> But I like Mom.<eos> I'm begging you.
I'm begging you.<eos> Tell him to stop peeking at my daughter.<eos> Stop peeking my daughter.<eos> Stop peeking my daughter. Please.<eos> I'm begging you.
I do the same.<eos> So technically, we both are messengers of Death.<eos> But government gives you food to eat, house to live in.<eos> But I see you...<eos> I believe I know you more than you know yourself.
Morning.<eos> You all right?<eos> How did I get back here?<eos> I don't know; I got the foggiest.<eos> I mean, I just came in here to call the police and-and then I found you.
Go to the door.<eos> Honey?<eos> Wh-Who are you?<eos> - Who am I?<eos> I haunt your dreams like a ghost, for I know what scares you most.
I-I don't think that you understand...<eos> It was my glasses this morning.<eos> They reminded him of Miss Kringle.<eos> He's afraid he's going to hurt me like he hurt her.<eos> Listen to me, you little idiot, I am telling you one last time,
- Just give us a minute.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Listen to me, and I know how this is gonna sound...<eos> You think that he has Alice Tetch's virus.<eos> - He told you.
And I finished the background check on everyone at the wedding.<eos> All clean.<eos> But the ex-boyfriend, Jason Myers, he's not.<eos> He's got one aggravated assault, two weapons violations.<eos> I have him waiting in interrogation for you.
You left your window open.<eos> Hey, are you okay?<eos> Wait.<eos> You know, don't you?<eos> He showed you.
Well, what else would it be?<eos> Something occurred to me when you introduced me to your mother.<eos> Why is it that I'm the only human in your life who knows who you really are?<eos> Because you asked me, remember?<eos> You insisted that I show you.
May I borrow your scarf?<eos> Your honor, is this necessary?<eos> Well, you want the full story, don't you?<eos> I mean, the devil's in the details.<eos> Thank you ever so much.
This is our shot.<eos> We just gotta find out where he's playing tonight.<eos> All right, let's get to work.<eos> A mystery to even me.<eos> Though, even if I did know, I probably wouldn't tell you.
Well, I'm Vince Vincente, rock god.<eos> And after careful deliberation, I've decided to cut the dead weight.<eos> I'm going solo.<eos> Castiel.<eos> Took you long enough.
I can't.<eos> -Are you actually trying to claim the sanctity of the psychic couch?<eos> That's fucking awesome.<eos> Bullshit, but awesome.<eos> -Well, I appreciate you... - Hey, whoa.
The identity of his enemy, for example.<eos> You found an empty apartment, you set up shop.<eos> But tonight you saw a man breaking into our house.<eos> When he left, you approached him, there was a fight.<eos> He put you here.
- That's what's messed up.<eos> I don't really think I know Earn anymore.<eos> Like, what happened at Princeton?<eos> I never asked.<eos> He'd tell you before me.
Now is not the time to bail on yourself just because Daddy is.<eos> I know, Brandon.<eos> I've been down that road.<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> I... I mean, everybody respects you.
What kind of doctor are you?<eos> Psychologist.<eos> Is that what you do, analyze people?<eos> Not like that. Different.<eos> Well, I was watching you, too.
No, you don't know...<eos> I knew the moment that I heard your name.<eos> I just didn't know that I would be here.<eos> Call 911 and go!<eos> Because we considered you as a host.
You got the prize money?<eos> - Prize money?<eos> - You know, for the... fight?<eos> How is there a fight?<eos> - They didn't tell you?
Yeah?<eos> You must be very proud of him.<eos> - Yeah, it's great.<eos> - It's a bit weird you didn't tell me.<eos> - I did tell you.
So that we can tell the facts from the fabrications.<eos> So speak the truth at all times.<eos> You go ahead and check.<eos> I will only tell the truth.<eos> Mr. Nachiket, I have patched you through.
You should be picking him up.<eos> No, not me.<eos> These are hands of a laborer, I might hurt him.<eos> You will spoil him.<eos> He will disown you when you grow old.
No more games!<eos> Truth!<eos> Truth?<eos> The truth is shocking.<eos> It will scare you out of your wits.
Welcome to CT surgery.<eos> Dr. Latham, thank you.<eos> I'll be supervising your fellowship.<eos> I look forward to it.<eos> Dr. Downey thought very highly of you.
Before that, you and Pe√±a had complete autonomy to call your own shots.<eos> It's gonna take you a minute to get used to the new order.<eos> You don't trust me yet?<eos> That's fine.<eos> But if I'm gonna have your back, I need to know that I can trust you. Otherwise, I have no problem sending you back to your wife in Miami.
I am dealing with it.<eos> How, Pablo?<eos> Tell me how.<eos> Negotiating?<eos> Yesterday, they nearly killed you for negotiating.
You know, I met the new head of Search Bloc.<eos> -Yeah?<eos> -He's an interesting guy.<eos> I have a good feeling about him.<eos> Before I forget, I want you... I want you to give this to Olivia.
[sighs]<eos> It happens.<eos> You look younger.<eos> It happens. [chuckles]<eos> Life in the country keeps you young.
Berna, last I heard, leaking classified intelligence is a federal offense.<eos> Especially when it ends up in the hands of a death squad that's killed innocent people.<eos> I'm sure some newspaper in America might be interested in hearing more about that.<eos> Are you threatening me?<eos> Yes, I'm threatening you.
Out front.<eos> [Gilberto] Don Berna!<eos> Welcome to Cali.<eos> Gilberto, thank you, brother.<eos> Forgive us, but we weren't expecting you.
Not just as a son... [up-tempo Latin music playing] [celebratory shouting]<eos> Sit down, ma'am.<eos> Sit. Thank you.<eos> Talk to me.<eos> Before he died, my husband told me to find you.
Baby.<eos> I'm such a loser!<eos> No.<eos> Harvey is a loser.<eos> I'm telling you, I know losers, and I could smell the loser on him from a mile away, honey.
I don't... I don't have any paper.<eos> Do I have to keep worrying?<eos> About our road trip?<eos> About you.<eos> I told you.
Okay, I guess. "The swagger"?<eos> Y'all want to start something?<eos> - Yeah. - We need to stop looking at this shit like it's some West Coast, incubated, garage-type bullshit.<eos> This here Miami, y'all.<eos> A nigga can have the most revolutionary idea since the Internet, and ain't nobody gonna take you seriously unless you got the swagger.
Madam President? Madam President?<eos> They're contacting us again.<eos> President Raney. You will meet with us, immediately.<eos> You will meet with us, immediately.<eos> Yes. I heard you the first time.
Your girl's pretty, but how do you fit in with these people?<eos> I fit in with her, that's more than enough.<eos> A toast to our brother who grew up and who's even settling' down!<eos> To you, Gennaro.<eos> Mr. Savastano, there's someone outside for you.
We expect you here within the hour, Director.<eos> - This is a mistake, sir.<eos> - Yep.<eos> Well, I make them from time to time.<eos> See you in an hour.
Are you sure you're okay?<eos> Yeah, I'm gonna need to take all of this.<eos> No.<eos> O, I said no.<eos> I will pay you back.
Yes, you did.<eos> That's, like, why you dropped out of college...<eos> No, I-I dropped out because I was failing, because I never went to classes, because I was trying to dedicate my time to The Mexican Funeral.<eos> Look, th-this isn't how I meant for this to happen, okay?<eos> I've wanted to tell you for years, but...
Misty, this is a very troubling time, but, uh, I always have time for you.<eos> Now, you were briefed by the CIA today, weren't you?<eos> I can't speak to any specifics.<eos> Everything's confidential, so...<eos> We understand that, Senator, and we won't press you on it, but can you tell us what the CIA said?
You know why.<eos> Others would have taken revenge, but not you.<eos> You asked them to make amends in front of everyone.<eos> Then they saw they could get to Dwarf, that's why Trak ratted.<eos> You had others get your revenge for you.
But I'm not like all the others, have you forgotten what I did for you?<eos> Are you threatening me?<eos> Don't you dare do that again.<eos> I wasn't threatening you,<eos> I wanted to remind you, because you're leaving me alone, and I never left you alone, ever!
- A year ago.<eos> - And you Ross?<eos> - Same.<eos> Listen, I'm sorry guys, but my family will definitely pick me up<eos> Listen .. it's up to you to entertain yourself ... but listen to me ...
- Why doesn't he know that?<eos> I'm-I'm very sorry, Mr. Solloway.<eos> You were attacked by someone with a knife.<eos> You bled profusely.<eos> They took you to surgery where Dr. Quittner closed the artery off.
So, um, Ms., um, Le Gall?<eos> Ms. Le who?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Juliette Le Gall.<eos> The woman who found you and brought you in.
Juliette Le Gall.<eos> The woman who found you and brought you in.<eos> - Juliette found me?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Juliette found you at 1:38 a. m.
Yeah.<eos> Come on.<eos> Mom did not say that.<eos> Yes, she did, man.<eos> I'm telling you.
But he escaped that dungeon.<eos> Rebuilt his fortune piece by piece.<eos> It may have taken more than a decade, but he became the man you see before you, and all for one reason.<eos> Now, you aren't clever enough to have destroyed my life on your own.<eos> Who helped you?
You're in there.<eos> Although just "San Francisco Bay's doctor, name withheld."<eos> Fell of a cliff.<eos> Almost famous.<eos> I'm guessing it was the car accident that distracted you.
You're all right.<eos> I thought Blackstone might have gotten to you somehow.<eos> Yeah, well... he would have.<eos> He tried.<eos> You know, I started to look into him right after I saw you last.
Don't give it to him, Mac.<eos> You son of a bitch!<eos> You think I'm playing?<eos> The canister.<eos> I will not ask you again.
'<eos> And the wicked wolf replied, 'All the better to eat you up with!<eos> [laughs maniacally] [gasps] Oh, snap! Girl, that ain't your grandmother!<eos> Get up out that house!<eos> [Clover grunting] Your Majesty, I've been looking all over for you.
Oh, the boy's been fine without us all these years.<eos> I doubt he'll even notice.<eos> He's pulled himself up by the bootstraps and made something of himself.<eos> A true riches-to-more-riches story.<eos> [laughs] I'm begging you.
-[screams] -[Leonard screaming] [Julien] No, Leonard, it's too high.<eos> Your Majesty?<eos> For a very good reason that I don't want to talk about now. I've made my decision.<eos> Clover, you will represent the kingdom in the Games.<eos> [shrieks] I mean, ahem, thank you, Sir. I won't let you down.
Thanks for coming to rescue me, everybody.<eos> I guess this means you really do love me.<eos> Of course we love you.<eos> [Hector] I do not.<eos> But I love you the most!
Finally. I thought I'd have to save myself.<eos> Get King Dummy in the basket.<eos> I'll take care of the traitors!<eos> Traitors?<eos> Didn't we tell you?
Yes?<eos> Can I help you?<eos> Hi, there, uh, my name is Mike Painter.<eos> Oh! Hi.<eos> Uh... my mom saw you on Dr. Phil and got very excited.
Can I help you?<eos> Hi, there, uh, my name is Mike Painter.<eos> Oh! Hi.<eos> Uh... my mom saw you on Dr. Phil and got very excited.<eos> I mean, I saw you, too.
Hi, there, uh, my name is Mike Painter.<eos> Oh! Hi.<eos> Uh... my mom saw you on Dr. Phil and got very excited.<eos> I mean, I saw you, too.<eos> So, uh, what brings you here?
Is there any physical evidence tying you to this hypothetical crime?<eos> Or the cover-up?<eos> Why did you want to run for mayor?<eos> It's... hard to remember now.<eos> Then let me remind you.
Previously on Z Nation.<eos> Lieutenant Roberta Warren. Missouri National Guard.<eos> We have the package here.<eos> Lot of people been looking for you, Mr. Murphy.
Yes. Yes, I am.<eos> Yes, and you-- you are the--<eos> I'm just security.<eos> Yeah?<eos> I've never seen you before now.
Yang offended Junior Commandant, Caused the death of his man.<eos> And will kill all of us in Pucheng<eos> Listen to what the people are saying!<eos> Sheriff Yang, Once the (Lao army storms the shy, They will kill everyone in the city!<eos> Sheriff Yang I beg you.
- Come on!<eos> And I'm going to entertain all points of view before I vote.<eos> Senator, this is all a Red Wheatus operation.<eos> And if you change sides, so will others, and we'll lose the majority.<eos> I'll call you back.
Although, it can be, and it often leads there, anyway- okay, well, you know what?<eos> You guys have given us so much to think about.<eos> And I think we should go to bed.<eos> Just the two of us, alone.<eos> Just us. [whispers] I know it's not the right time, but I told you.
- What did you just say to me?<eos> - I just said, this dildo is gonna be in your face slapping it around, then up your ass marching you right out the door if it catches you in violation of your lease ever again.<eos> Hello?<eos> Rachel, it's Professor Dunbar.<eos> How can I help you, Professor?
It's the same thing it was with you and Sheila.<eos> Just because you were the one to break it off with her doesn't mean that your heart wasn't still broken.<eos> I love you, Donna.<eos> I love you too, Louis.<eos> Sir, may I help you?
If you'll excuse me, I need to go to my office.<eos> I'm not going anywhere!<eos> Not until you understand that if you are sorry for me, you wouldn't have taken this case on in the first place instead of using it to make a name for yourself.<eos> That's enough.<eos> You said everything you needed to say, now walk yourself out of here before I have security remove you.
You turn yourself in, you get maybe three years, and you keep her out.<eos> Why the hell would I do that?<eos> Because if she turns on you, you're gonna be getting a hell of a lot more.<eos> I'm not cutting a deal.<eos> And you think if you're willing to do this to your own daughter, she won't be willing to do it to you?
Thank you.<eos> Why didn't you tell me?<eos> Because I wasn't sure I was gonna take it.<eos> But now you are.<eos> Jessica, if I thought there would be a chance in the world that you would come with me, I would've asked you.
Smashing up the GCPD.<eos> I knew this day would come.<eos> Need a lift?<eos> At least they're safe.<eos> We would never forget you, Commissioner.
Which building you want, Buzz?<eos> You can have your pick.<eos> Who's there?<eos> Mr. Cobblepot, you're back.<eos> We haven't seen you for some time.
Except... she was staring at me<eos> and gave me the creeps.<eos> What did I do?<eos> I gouged out her eyes.<eos> Brother Foon Hei, I checked up on you.
Oh, that's the tragic thing about being a savior.<eos> You have to keep saving people.<eos> But once you're off the chessboard... everything falls apart.<eos> All those happy endings turn to dust, and your entire life means... nothing.<eos> Let me show you what it feels like.
I am so sorry for what I did.<eos> It's all right.<eos> You did it, Swan.<eos> Here we are.<eos> Told you I could help you, Doctor.
Stand over there, please.<eos> Security check.<eos> What I can't wrap my head around was why.<eos> Why that place?<eos> With underlings from your department, every one of whom despises you.
Well, the lease is up in a couple of days, and... I don't think I can really afford to...<eos> I think I'm just going to have to... accept that it's...<eos> I'm sorry about that, darling.<eos> But, of course, we're just a little bit tight on the purse strings, too.<eos> No, I wasn't asking you for any...
- No, we had an understanding.<eos> It's fucking bullshit. I thought you were a man of your word.<eos> - I never gave you my word.<eos> - Give me back my million in cash. Just settle down.<eos> And I'm gonna open up my own fucking shop and bury you next to fucking Andre 'cause you both fucking deserve each other.
Aw. Reggie was a photographer with "Stars and Stripes."<eos> Now they said that you're having trouble catching your breath?<eos> Well, I can't say you're making it any easier.<eos> Stop it.<eos> Mr. Dixon, um, the doctor that put you on steroids...
Of course.<eos> Then let's do that.<eos> I want his kidney.<eos> Mr. Vance, you are severely immunocompromised.<eos> If you received an HIV-positive organ, if you contracted HIV in any way, it could immediately progress to AIDS, and that would most likely kill you.
Thank you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Looks like our time together's up.<eos> Yeah, you got me, Doc.<eos> Can't put anything over on you.
We have been in there for years.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I looked into your kills.<eos> Some of them check out.<eos> - I told you.
Do that on your own, too?<eos> Yes, just me.<eos> I shot him.<eos> Our consultant here tells me there were at least five attackers.<eos> So, who helped you?
You can't afford them anymore.<eos> Why?<eos> Because in addition to killing 22 men, your mine collapse triggered a landslide, which polluted a large swath of Kentucky watershed.<eos> And you're legally responsible for the clean-up.<eos> The EPA's about to bill you for hundreds of millions of dollars.
I'm sorry, but have we met?<eos> No. I'm here on behalf of a mutual friend...<eos> Dr. Jekyll. I'm Mr. Hyde.<eos> Hyde?<eos> I don't believe Henry's ever mentioned you.
I-I didn't mean to startle you.<eos> Hyde, what are you doing here?<eos> Might I talk with you for a bit? You may.<eos> I must confess, you... left me quite curious the other night.<eos> I wonder why Henry's never mentioned you.
Things like... passion and desire are little more than...<eos> I need someone who wants to bathe in their passion and give in to desire.<eos> I have a feeling you understand me, don't you, Mr. Hyde?<eos> What makes you think that?<eos> When you walked into the parlor the other night, I saw the way the others looked at you.
You wouldn't think it was such a wonder, but buildings like this and... That, and those, didn't have windows like this.<eos> Um...<eos> I-I'm sorry.<eos> Why am I here?<eos> I invited you.
Of course.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Second Lieutenant Kazuma Eito of the Imperial Army reporting.<eos> Prince Imperial Yeong, son of Gojong<eos> We've been expecting you.
I didn't think you'd come to hear about my hobbies.<eos> Look, if someone messed with the security tape, they could've made the kidnapper look like anyone.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You're a technical genius, Mr. Karig.<eos> No one here is accusing you of creative brilliance.
So the last time he went out for a smoke, I got out and I just took off.<eos> I couldn't see.<eos> It was so dark.<eos> And branches kept cutting me, but I knew I had to keep running.<eos> Mr. Stone, when they called you, what did they want?
Oh. Like the one where you're going to tell us anything you had on the Smiths?<eos> Yeah, that one.<eos> I did that.<eos> Mm. What about your little chat you just had with Thomas?<eos> I warned you.
What if it was meant to be found?<eos> Look, I don't care what the Governor's doing.<eos> The President of the United Sates needs to talk to him.<eos> No, I'm not... I'm not asking you.<eos> I'm telling you.
Hey, since you're new, I'll let your lack of faith slide this time, all right?<eos> Jack used to work South America back in the day.<eos> Like when they invented fire.<eos> - A couple years after that.<eos> - Okay, when you're both done reminding me that I'm the only one here with wisdom, I'll tell you about my contact.
I suggest the two of you go.<eos> Now.<eos> We don't serve your kind here.<eos> Well, it's good to see you still keep honest riffraff like us out of this cesspool of a bar of yours.<eos> I'm not gonna ask you again.
I was lucky.<eos> That's all.<eos> Morning.<eos> Morning, Congressman.<eos> Last time I saw you, you told us to keep you updated, so...
I have a hundred people ready to march on City Hall, but they're afraid of what will happen if they do.<eos> I need you to forget about City Hall.<eos> The local police aren't worth the fight. Ms. Rhodes, no.<eos> No, we can't back down now.<eos> I'm not asking you to.
for a sit-down with the president. Claim his attention as a victory.<eos> Spin it however you want.<eos> Why the hell should I go with you?<eos> Because standing in the schoolhouse doorway didn't work for George Wallace, and it isn't gonna work for you.<eos> History will remember you for this.
Any sacrifices we make to eradicate them from the face of the Earth are sacrifices worth making.<eos> When a snake's in your kitchen, you don't invite it to dinner, you cut off its head.<eos> You make a good point, General.<eos> And seeing that this is my kitchen...<eos> I am relieving you of your command, effective immediately. - What?
Okay.<eos> I said, I was fine.<eos> You didn't need to check on me.<eos> I'm not checking on you.<eos> You've been weird ever since I told you.
- What happened?<eos> - Nothing. Come on! Go!<eos> Your brother looks to be at the fag end of things.<eos> Poor digestion's all.<eos> I thank you very much, ma'am.
What are you doing up?<eos> I thought I heard something.<eos> Something's up there.<eos> There's no one else here.<eos> Told you.
I'm still talking!<eos> Let's let our bodies do it for us.<eos> See, she loves it.<eos> Ah, can you believe that Oleg still won't buy the minivan?<eos> Sophie, I'm telling you.
He could use it.<eos> He's wound pretty tight.<eos> Okay, I'll just...<eos> So how'd you know?<eos> This Flynn guy tell you?
Well, if you have his name, you... you must have other information.<eos> I only met him once for a matter of minutes, and I was drugged.<eos> I don't know what else I could have given you that you don't already have.<eos> What did he say to you?<eos> I didn't tell you because I was afraid you'd turn me over to the kempeitai.
Why Brighton?<eos> The Ablewhites have taken a house there for the season.<eos> It is a very quiet event, as you see, or I would be attending myself.<eos> My solicitor meets us in London tonight.<eos> He will see you on your onward journey.
Let me assure you I did Rosanna no wrong.<eos> I was mistaken.<eos> You DO need to hear what she has to say.<eos> Take it.<eos> I never set eyes on you afore.
But one year later,<eos> Franklin received Rosanna Spearman's missive from beyond the grave.<eos> The hunt was reignited, and Franklin hastened back to Yorkshire.<eos> 'Sir, if you are curious to know the meaning 'of my behaviour to you whilst you were staying in the house 'of my mistress, Lady Verinder, 'do what you were told to do 'in the memorandum enclosed within.<eos> 'And do it without any person being present to overlook you.
I should be of little use to you here, sir.<eos> I never learnt to swim.<eos> I'd hoped you'd hold on to this so I stay tethered to dry ground.<eos> But I must go. Look at the letter again, sir, and you shall see!<eos> Do what you were told to do in the memorandum, and do it without any person being present to overlook you.
Who is our thief?<eos> !<eos> It can't be!<eos> Here, sir.<eos> This will revive you.
What demons drove her to this?<eos> 'Sir, you will find your nightgown in my hiding place 'with the smear of paint on it.'<eos> And you'll want to know how it came to be hidden by me, and why I said nothing to you about it in my lifetime.<eos> 'I have only one reason to give to you.<eos> 'I did those strange things because I loved you.'
Lady Verinder is concerned and has charged me with examining you.<eos> I don't want to put you to any trouble.<eos> I merely went for some air.<eos> Take your cloak off, girl, and sit here.<eos> And what I'd hidden under my cloak when I found you most wonderfully in my room with the doctor, you are now privy to.
After "The Anarchist Cookbook," you wrote another book.<eos> I've written a number of books, but the book that came immediately after "The Anarchist Cookbook" was a historical novel entitled "The First Casualty."<eos> It was the story of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in 1914.<eos> It was the spark that caused the First World War, and it's told from the point of view of the assassin, Gavrilo Princip.<eos> What fascinated you about him?
Slow down.<eos> The deli guy can't believe we've already gone through the two pounds of ham and cheese from last week.<eos> Triplets.<eos> Speaking of, you know where our third is?<eos> Let me show you again.
He's got 80 seconds.<eos> Paige, start a countdown.<eos> We need to create a pulley system.<eos> I'll gonna go in, you two pull us out.<eos> With the weight of the grain pushing down on you, if we don't yank you out properly, we sever your spinal cord.
TOBY:<eos> Get in there.<eos> In 28 seconds we pull you out, and you better be holding Daniel when we do.<eos> Okay.<eos> He's lighter than you, he won't be at the bottom, feel around by your knees, that's probably where he stopped sinking.
No. No, I think... Let's...<eos> -I love it. I love it. -Okay.<eos> -Cool.<eos> -Excellent.<eos> -Yeah. And your agent told you, right?
I thought you're the only guy who's dealing with Mr. Zar's business?<eos> Jitpong is from America.<eos> And Mr. Zar likes him a lot.<eos> Mr. Qian, we can always talk about commission later.<eos> I'm telling you, you're not the only middleman in this business.
Catalan!<eos> He said his name was Catalan.<eos> Catalan.<eos> Guard.<eos> If you tell anyone... he'll kill you, too.
I get it.<eos> He's a busy man, and his word is crap.<eos> Good morning.<eos> I got your text, your voice mail, and your e-mail. What's up?<eos> I just wanted to say, again, I am really sorry for springing that video on you.
It's nothing serious.<eos> It's just that Gerard and Bruno... Well, you know.<eos> They're hooking up.<eos> Come on, man. You want me to believe that?<eos> I'm telling you that they are. No way.
Yes, I love that word.<eos> Ethics. Sounds good, right?<eos> Yes, from the outside, it is very easy to wave the ethic flag.<eos> Was it ethical of me to steal a test from Eugeni to give it to Bruno?<eos> Oh, didn't I tell you?
I was supposed to take that motion sickness medication 30 minutes prior to liftoff, but... I was so wrapped up in the case, I... I forgot.<eos> Doctor, I threw up.<eos> All over the evidence bags that Gibbs sent with me.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I embarrassed you.
Thought we were supposed to relax.<eos> You're right, uh... I'm going to reset it.<eos> Okay...<eos> Tim, there is no way.<eos> No, I'm telling you, I think that she is.
Besides, Scorpion should get some good press if Walter can get everything going.<eos> He'll fix it. He always does.<eos> Diagnostics complete.<eos> Checking the results.<eos> Told you.
I don't need your help to disappear.<eos> I need an identity, specifically the one you created for Sonia Bloom-- the research scientist.<eos> 15 years ago, she arrived in her lab to find her life's work stolen and her partner dead of an apparent suicide.<eos> Except it wasn't a suicide, and she knew it.<eos> Fearing for her life, she contacted you and became someone else.
Oh! And the banana.<eos> That's 11.<eos> One more.<eos> Don't tell me.<eos> The doctor will see you now.
I would never hurt Kara.<eos> I was having breakfast when the fire started.<eos> Where?<eos> Verdugo on Kinzie.<eos> Did anyone see you there?
Go on.<eos> I'll join Marcus.<eos> For Arturo.<eos> I'm telling you, I didn't kill Bennett.<eos> Once Bennett's wife... Sorry, his widow... Identified you, we did some research.
- Why would we shoot you?<eos> Because you think I'm trying to shoot you.<eos> Look, I hate to break it to you, but these aren't my guys.<eos> He did just shoot one of 'em.<eos> Look, I don't have a gun, so, you know, you guys... you guys do you.
10K?<eos> Mr. Murphy.<eos> Look what I found.<eos> She should've had more faith.<eos> She didn't deserve you.
Amen, bubba.<eos> Gibbs, you may have noticed that it's been a little awkward between Abby and me.<eos> No.<eos> I'm not wearing the cobalt vest if you ask me to.<eos> I didn't ask you to.
The memories can be very painful.<eos> The joy of having children is one of the most efficient methods--<eos> I don't care!<eos> You have to take me back!<eos> -I've told you a thousand times already!
You're right.<eos> So, what did you find out?<eos> You're going to bomb all the power grids.<eos> Aren't you?<eos> I should have read you in sooner.
Where'd you get that thing?<eos> Listen, go up and say hi to Burke.<eos> He'd love to see you. Yeah?<eos> What's the matter?<eos> Oh, I didn't tell you.
But you might find some across the border.<eos> Or if you have access to a lab, you can probably Google it and make it yourself.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Your wife didn't want to interrupt you.<eos> She'll see you back home at dinner.
But I like the river.<eos> It's quiet.<eos> So you've been spending time on the Delaware?<eos> For work.<eos> I thought I told you.
Tree pythons are... nocturnal, right?<eos> I think.<eos> I have to give you credit for devising such a clever hiding place,<eos> Mr. Lima.<eos> He will be arresting you now.
It just won't spray.<eos> Been asking for a new one for six months.<eos> May I?<eos> Give it a try.<eos> I don't like owing anybody anything, so I'll pay you back with some advice.
And it isn't illegal to buy.<eos> Is there something you want to ask, Kari?<eos> Carry on.<eos> How did you find the Doll's House?<eos> Who received you?
This is a list of properties owned by Degerman Concern.<eos> We want to root out all building misuses and clear the company's reputation.<eos> Sounds to me you need to clear the company's reputation.<eos> We only need to get rid of false accusations.<eos> -Did Robert Degerman put you up to this?
I remember playing with a piece of rubber hose.<eos> It was orange.<eos> I've never shot up.<eos> How would I know that?<eos> I'm telling you.
I'll get my papers in another way.<eos> I'll make a rich man of some attach√©, you asshole!<eos> With little shits like him, you take the bucks and run<eos> He gave me six weeks' income, I'll be gone in one<eos> I'll castrate you next time I see you, you little fuck.
You're her brother, my ass<eos> Come on, take me inside<eos> Look, Kim, who got our application<eos> I said I'd bring us all salvation<eos> Oh, my God, Monsieur John, yes, of course he sent you
And we're done talking about your little bitch.<eos> This is her fault, bringing attention to my operation.<eos> You give the mom any pointers?<eos> How you get an interview to crack?<eos> I'm begging you.
You okay? Rusty. It's okay.<eos> We're good, we're good. Sorry, man.<eos> My head was somewhere else.<eos> I have to take you to surgery now.<eos> I arranged for a private hallway, so no one would see you.
You have all those bad habits that Sun Beichuan has.<eos> Who would ever like someone like that?<eos> You'll end up nowhere following his lead!<eos> You're right.<eos> That's why I'm following you from now on.
All the numbers are on the wall.<eos> Hank likes the decaf, I myself like the real thing.<eos> I like to keep things in order around here.<eos> When will you be back?<eos> Not sure, maybe I'll check on you in a couple weeks.
Why would you tell him that?<eos> That's terrible advice.<eos> So you wouldn't want to have anything on Penny?<eos> Well, of course not.<eos> So, if I actually know something right now... and I do you don't want me to tell you?
I just didn't write them.<eos> I never even had an account on that ridiculous site.<eos> So you still claim that someone created a phony profile and posed as you.<eos> I was a founding partner of a top ad agency. You really think if I was gonna seduce a teenage girl, I'd do it in a public forum using my own name and picture?<eos> You told the police you were lured to a motel in East Orange by a phone call from a mystery man who alleged to have information that would, help you in the lawsuit you were fighting?
Said he would kill me if I didn't confess my sins.<eos> But you know what?<eos> I never did.<eos> 'Cause I didn't do any of those things he accused me of.<eos> After you were fired you told anyone who would listen that the woman who was suing you was the one who set you up.
- Oh, pittsburgh, interesting.<eos> Home of the bengals.<eos> - Home of the steelers.<eos> - No, this is the home of the stealers.<eos> I set you up perfectly for that.
He robbed the casino and then went after Sarah because he thought she could I.D. him.<eos> There's a warrant out on Billy now, and Murtaugh's on his way to meet you.<eos> Billy doesn't happen to be tall, slicked-back hair and kind of scruffy, is he?<eos> Yeah. How'd you know?<eos> Told you so.
Well, if you knew how worried we were about you, you wouldn't be mad.<eos> Sure, when I'm worried, I sit down and watch a 90-minute light comedy, too.<eos> Not.<eos> Evan, Mommy made a mistake.<eos> But she's gonna make it up to you.
Ha-hah! Now you have to wait for backup.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> I'm gonna shimmy them off.<eos> Oh, God, the eye contact is the worst part.<eos> Ah. I told you, Jake.
This?<eos> Melissa!<eos> Melissa, please.<eos> Come down from there.<eos> I'm begging you.
Now, I'm pretty sure his DNA is gonna be a match for the blood found at the scene of the robbery.<eos> Now, Trafoya used to work here, with you.<eos> He resigned in 2013-- something about, uh, evidence going missing at a narcotics raid.<eos> He's talking to a Detective Cosa right now.<eos> He might not give you up, but then again, you know how easy it is for criminals to turn on their friends.
You don't want to be the one to put him at the scene yesterday.<eos> You want me to admit that he's hanging with SBK again, because of me?<eos> Don't forget about the gun.<eos> He only had that because of you.<eos> Explain that and my partner and I will do everything we can to see that you're offered a deal that keeps you out of gen pop when you go to prison.
-I wonder why!<eos> We got a code yellow for Stan Ian Dickson, 12605 Gardenia Grove, over.<eos> You have been sitting for five hours and 16 minutes already today.<eos> -I recommend you stay upright...<eos> -I warned you!
Well, we got to figure out something.<eos> This video chat thing is getting old.<eos> Okay, I get it.<eos> We should be in the same city if we're gonna do this for real.<eos> I'm telling you.
Oh. - Thank you. Now, where was I?<eos> - Uh, "Master Jim... found you..."<eos> Yes. Thank you.<eos> Master Jim, you have been chosen.<eos> The Amulet of Daylight challenges you to ascend to the most sacred of offices.
I don't want to die.<eos> Goodness gracious!<eos> Who does?<eos> Maybe you should take this back.<eos> The amulet called to you, Master Jim.
No, Master Jim. You must excel at all three.<eos> If trolls are ever going to embrace you as Trollhunter, you must ignore your humanly instincts.<eos> Do that, and I have no doubt you will defeat Draal.<eos> Look... it's training.<eos> Let your fear keep you alive.
Yeah! Metaphoric.<eos> I was... in an exploring stage.<eos> Not successful.<eos> Your words are beautiful, Jim.<eos> Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
Bulgarian.<eos> It's pronounced "Blink-heh."<eos> - I really appreciate that, Mr. Blinky.<eos> - Blink-heh.<eos> - And I'm sorry I kicked you earlier.
-He's got stamina for an amateur.<eos> -He does.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> -Thank you for today.
But I start working with Anton first thing in the morning, and I'm confident that we can meet that deadline.<eos> So I will need marketing and cover artwork by the end of this week.<eos> Great. That's all from me.<eos> Damn, girl.<eos> If I didn't know you, I'd be impressed.
I've got it. - Did you?<eos> I had a great time in Bangkok.<eos> He committed two murders.<eos> You didn't go today either.<eos> I've told you many times. Chemo will help you relieve the pain.
Hang on, let me get this straight, you're saying my brother is alive?<eos> ~ Yes, we are.<eos> ~ Where is he?<eos> We don't know.<eos> Do you think it's possible he could have fooled you?
~ No.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Nelson, we need everyone out here now.<eos> Of course, it wouldn't be my brother without twists and turns.<eos> And, as some of you know, his latest manuscript has gone missing.
Where's our fuckin' money?<eos> - You fuckin' hid it!<eos> - Wait!<eos> - Give it here!<eos> - I'm telling you!
- Don't be a pain in the ass.<eos> - I ordered.<eos> Enjoy your big American breakfast.<eos> I thought it should be negotiated at the highest level as a courtesy to you.<eos> I thank you, sir.
Sure looks like it.<eos> Hi.<eos> Nice to see you girls.<eos> Come in, come in.<eos> I know I marked you off.
- All of you!<eos> - Stay clear!<eos> Hey, this way, David!<eos> Stay behind the barrier!<eos> That's the guy I was telling you about.
Why wouldn't she be?<eos> Well, so everybody wants something.<eos> A brain, a heart, courage.<eos> Kevin's in the Emerald City.<eos> He's the one that's gonna give it to you.
Tell us we're lunatics.<eos> Yeah, it sounds crazy, but... these are crazy times, huh?<eos> So, when Kevin comes back, you're not gonna jam us up?<eos> No.<eos> I'm not gonna jam you up.
I get the cache, and guaranteed safe passage off the island for everyone in this fort... and you get Nassau.<eos> The money isn't ours to give.<eos> We have partners who would almost certainly rather fight this out than lose their treasury.<eos> Your partners are your problem.<eos> There is a reason why I invited you here and not them.
You got it?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Good.<eos> Slowly.<eos> Everything like I told you.
According to Carter, the list of sleepers is on a USB flash drive.<eos> We can't move in until we confirm Grimes has it.<eos> Give me a second.<eos> Andy.<eos> I'm sorry I've been shutting you out.
I'm an ex-soldier.<eos> I can't just stroll into the Pentagon, into the office of the Director of National Intelligence.<eos> We're still trying to work it out, but we'll find a way.<eos> I may have a way.<eos> Give me a few minutes, I'll call you back.
and give you amazing businesswomen a chance to connect and talk about how to synergize and mobilize. Zeva: We're all strong, like-minded women, so let's crack open our brains and really get into it.<eos> Yes.<eos> Whether it's how to rock a romper at a work event, or who you should be voting for, a WEMUN woman is the person to ask.<eos> Also, for those of you asking on our Facebook if the group is open to trans women, the answer is: we don't know, okay?<eos> So, go forth and mingle and make connections that will catapult you to the next level.
Uh, where were your principles when you were rolling around under a porch with Tom, like, "Oh, where's my headband?"<eos> Tom is poly and we all know that.<eos> Don't sleep on that fact.<eos> I ain't sleeping on shit except maybe Tom because he's also bi.<eos> And I'd like to remind the three of you not to sleep on this friendship because I know if feels like it's just gonna be, like, love and lust pushing you forward, but lust fades and friendship never does.
Say again.<eos> Do not engage.<eos> He just took two down.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Who sent you?
She's one of us.<eos> Come on, grab your bag. Come on, let's go!<eos> How did you find us?<eos> A contact at the airport saw you get into the wrong taxi.<eos> You're lucky I found you.
How did you find us?<eos> A contact at the airport saw you get into the wrong taxi.<eos> You're lucky I found you.<eos> This is very radicalized neighborhood.<eos> Whoever set you up couldn't have set you up in a worse way.
If you don't know, why are you so freaked out?<eos> Because of the book.<eos> Because of my friendship with Charles.<eos> I figured he found out.<eos> But I swear, I swear that I didn't know that he... She was the one who was torturing you.
Because it may be a part of the reason why you were tortured.<eos> Most of the e-mails that I sent in high school were about mean queen Alison.<eos> And her loyal band of followers.<eos> I gave details about how you made my life a living hell.<eos> And how the rest of you just watched.
And I'm the only way to survive what's coming next.<eos> The hour is upon us.<eos> The enemy we are about to face is unlike any other.<eos> He is the greatest killer I have ever trained.<eos> But I remind you of that which is more dangerous than any killer...
- Yes, Baron!<eos> - Like I am,<eos> Gabriel transformed his flesh into Hellfire to smite our enemies!<eos> Not only did he die a martyr, he was reborn a god!<eos> Is that what he tells you?
He may know where Rip is.<eos> SIGINT has him headed to a meeting in Lagos Harbour.<eos> All right, White Squadron, we're on the hook for this.<eos> Sir, my team wants that mission.<eos> I already tasked you with it.
Tell her I'm sorry!<eos> Obviously, this is a difficult time.<eos> I urge you to use the resources we have available...<eos> Talking to counselors, taking time off, whatever you need.<eos> The Office of the President will support you.
Not everything's about Annalise.<eos> Did Frank kill Rebecca?<eos> No.<eos> BonBon, please don't lie to us.<eos> Why would I lie to you right now?
I don't know.<eos> It's just...<eos> I mean, look at you.<eos> You've been coming here for 26 years, and y-you're still a mess.<eos> I mean, what has coming here done for you?
- No. - Then what's wrong?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> - Why are you lying?<eos> - 'Cause he's always doing it.<eos> I brought you here to fill the seats behind Annalise, not to bicker.
Right now, I just want to go home, spend some time with my family.<eos> Mrs. Mahoney, are you happy to put this all behind you?<eos> No, because it isn't behind us.<eos> Can you tell us what you mean by that?<eos> What'd I tell you?
Michael!<eos> Michael!<eos> Michael?<eos> Michael!<eos> Poseidon sent you?
Sana'a is falling.<eos> We work together or we both die.<eos> You have my word.<eos> It's Abu Ramal that Poseidon wants free.<eos> Poseidon sent you?
We got to move.<eos> Sid...<eos> Sid!<eos> I heard your call, infidel.<eos> Wings will not carry you to safety.
He's a CIA operative, deep cover.<eos> He runs a splinter cell called 21-void.<eos> What does this have to do with you?<eos> He targeted me for my skills, blackmailed me.<eos> He told me if I didn't agree to come work for him, he'd go after you and Linc, put you both in jail.
Do you think they noticed?<eos> Let's not take any chances.<eos> Guys.<eos> Your faces were on the news.<eos> Somebody sees you, this thing is over.
- I don't know.<eos> - That's right, Mariana, you don't know.<eos> You have no idea what it's like taking care of a kid.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot that you were a step-dad for, like, five minutes.<eos> After everything that Ana put you and Jesus through.
We remember because we were scared... and... hungry.<eos> And our diapers were full,<eos> - we were covered in our own...<eos> - Okay, look, I... did a lotta things.<eos> I never left you like that.
The power coming back on will spark it.<eos> If we don't get the air vents back online first somehow.<eos> You guys are sitting underneath a... 4-story bomb.<eos> How long do we have before the generator kicks back on?<eos> And blow you up?
Oliver, we're not leaving.<eos> We're not going anywhere.<eos> We're not abandoning you.<eos> I understand that you're not abandoning me.<eos> You're doing what I'm asking you to do because Ch--
We're not abandoning you.<eos> I understand that you're not abandoning me.<eos> You're doing what I'm asking you to do because Ch--<eos> Chase knows how I think.<eos> He knows that if he puts the two of you in danger-- and he's going to try to--that...
But we're building something back at home.<eos> Something with a future.<eos> Let me show you that.<eos> Look, if you see it and you think it's bullshit, fine.<eos> I'll outfit you and send you on your way.
Sit your ass down.<eos> Because you have a three as your first letter in your number.<eos> - Ew, 35? - Mm-mm.<eos> Yeah, that's really bad.<eos> Okay, so if my friend Adam here pointed to you, why don't you come on up, tell us a little bit about yourself, what makes you tick.
‚ô™ She took my love ‚ô™ Then ran around ‚ô™ With every single guy in town ‚ô™<eos> ‚ô™ Whoa-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh ‚ô™ Her world branded Essie MacGowan a thief.<eos> ‚ô™ Ah So a thief she became.<eos> ‚ô™ ... leave me with a broken heart ‚ô™<eos> ‚ô™ Now listen people what I'm tellin' you ‚ô™
- Oh, nothing much.<eos> Just put a little song in your heart.<eos> Put a little...<eos> Why did you bring us here?<eos> I didn't bring you anywhere.
Well, where else would we be?<eos> All right, all right.<eos> Whoo! Ooh!<eos> Swing and a miss.<eos> I didn't tell you.
She's only been gone for a few hours.'<eos> But I am really starting to get worried.<eos> Okay. It's just been a few hours?<eos> I'm sure she'll turn up.<eos> I'll fly from Hong Kong to Vegas and meet you both there.
Now, you haven't paid me a dime yet.<eos> So, give me my script back.<eos> The deal's already closed.<eos> Mike... I think we can work something out.<eos> Well, if you'd like, I can have one of my lawyers come and clarify the details for the both of you.
Dead.<eos> A spiritual coma, if we're getting technical.<eos> Her physical body. Where is it?<eos> That's for me to know, and for you to dot, dot, dot.<eos> I hope you enjoyed the little show I put on for you.
I hope you enjoyed the little show I put on for you.<eos> It's been a hoot watching you take on the devil.<eos> Especially considering I've had him wrapped around my finger since the minute I stepped into hell.<eos> Why did you think he wanted you?<eos> Because I wanted you.
Detective!<eos> Detective!<eos> What the hell were you thinking?<eos> I thought I was being quite responsible bringing her directly to the hospital.<eos> You mean after the two of you went off and interrogated a felon on bail?
Hey, buddy.<eos> Mom, how did y'all even find us?<eos> They helped.<eos> Hello, lads.<eos> They have a thermal imaging satellite that saw you.
He gave me her phone number.<eos> Yeah, nice.<eos> My loyal...<eos> Ish subjects, these troubled times, I'm aware there might be some confusion as to where you're supposed to place your loyalty.<eos> Even with Lucifer back in the cage, there are those of you who would try to help him... Because he scares you or engorges you.
Right.<eos> Hello, Winchester.<eos> Ketch?<eos> Where's Mick?<eos> He didn't tell you?
Mom?<eos> Hey!<eos> Ketch, stop.<eos> I really wouldn't move.<eos> She will shoot you.
Hey!<eos> I was talking to you.<eos> Mom?<eos> I really wouldn't move.<eos> She will shoot you.
Don't.<eos> ...in this child.<eos> ‚ô™ I can hear them say ‚ô™<eos> ‚ô™ Carry on, my wayward son ‚ô™<eos> She will shoot you.
- Ben?<eos> - Beth!<eos> Chloe!<eos> Good to see you looking so well.<eos> I haven't seen you since court.
Uh, yeah, I see them.<eos> Okay, we're about, I don't know, half a mile in.<eos> Road's a little rough.<eos> Yeah, just go slow.<eos> Okay, see you in a few.
They told me to pound sand.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Teddy Gunth!<eos> So I told them, "You listen to me right now.<eos> You send me his goddamn audition tape right now, or I'm gonna have Screen Actors Guild on you so fast, your shoes are gonna curl."
I wonder what.<eos> William of Orange paid you to hurt me, to take my son, - poison my Minister.<eos> - Poison what minister? You think me a fool.<eos> You believe it is William who hates you?<eos> And, trust me, everybody hates you.
My king!<eos> The Lord is making himself very clear to you, Your Majesty.
Your Church and your God cannot condone a double adultery.<eos> Your continued relations with a married woman are incurring a debt, and the reckoning is not yet paid.<eos> I do not respond well to threats, Bishop.<eos> Neither does the Almighty.<eos> Sire, the Lord is speaking to you as he spoke to Elijah, in a still, small voice.
And you appear to be frustrated.<eos> It pains me to say, I am, madame.<eos> Since you, in the past, assured me so clearly of your desire to help my family.<eos> The desire was never lacking, madame.<eos> In any case, I helped you as far as I was able.
I am still his favourite but one day, that will change.<eos> This baby will only hasten the inevitable.<eos> Mandrake.<eos> Keep it with you, always.<eos> She is... kicking you at night.
- Wait, wait, wait.<eos> What?<eos> Where are we going?<eos> To rescue him.<eos> I wasn't expecting you.
You heard the part where I don't have powers, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> But they don't know that.<eos> You know you're being lied to, right?<eos> I can only speculate as to who hired you...
But they're working for Senator Nadeer, and what she really wants is inside this case.<eos> It's a cure... For Inhumans.<eos> Hold your fire.<eos> I don't suppose she told you how much this was worth.<eos> Probably a lot more than she's paying you.
- Sorry.<eos> You weren't built to last.<eos> The Labyrinth is compromised.<eos> The deadliest tome in the world is in the hands of a mad scientist, who snuck out the back door with cattle-prod man.<eos> I'm... sorry we let you down.
Don't.<eos> - They don't want us here.<eos> - Most of them don't mind. The ones who do, we win them over.<eos> - You want to win over Troy?<eos> - Work in progress. In the meantime, both of you stay away from him.
- We will block the road with our wagons, we will block it.<eos> Any man who approaches that fort will be shot!<eos> Captain, these men are loyal Tories.<eos> - Their crops feed your army. - Ja.<eos> And their army protect you from the rebel horde.
The hotel, why did you leave it?<eos> I told you, I wanted to broker a deal with Dante.<eos> Always for yourself.<eos> I would've brought the others.<eos> I'm not the same man that brought you to Mexico.
I still can't find my phone.<eos> Oleg, this is our new show.<eos> Grab the popcorn from my purse.<eos> You want cheddar cheese or kettle corn?<eos> You know I can hear you, right?
Re-imagined as an English dandy with a nose for trouble.<eos> Great, and I'll play the butler who doesn't show up.<eos> I mean, we're not going, right?<eos> No!<eos> You know I can hear you?
Be safe.<eos> You, too.<eos> Your commander, he let your men die.<eos> He did.<eos> I offered you my men. To save them. Why did he order you to stand down?
Love you too.<eos> Good call on the eyelashes.<eos> First time there's been a better rack than mine in the apartment.<eos> Okay, these are the choices.<eos> They're on loan from the top designers, and if you hurt them, those bitches will hunt you down.
Indeed, it is.<eos> Veil swore the same words.<eos> At least she don't mock me by pretending to believe them.<eos> I know your games, Lydia.<eos> Sweet words, trying to placate the beast just long enough for sunny to come save you both.
It'll all be over soon now.<eos> I can't lose you.<eos> You're ok.<eos> Come on.<eos> I told you, it has never been opened.
Yes, Gary?<eos> Do we know what the odds are for a major surgery like this?<eos> I mean, in terms of patient survival.<eos> So, I'm not prepared to answer that right now, but the medical team is gonna be briefing the press pool after the successful completion of President Kirkman's surgery.<eos> Until then, I'll just be updating you on as-needed basis.
Come on, Alex.<eos> Warriors, right?<eos> Come on, help me up.<eos> No, we're not hiding anything.<eos> Look, I already told you.
I didn't know.<eos> Thank you.<eos> For what?<eos> Almost killing someone in cold blood?<eos> This is Dr. Karen Sun, the profiler I told you about.
Please.<eos> Tell us where the attack is going to happen.<eos> For him.<eos> You murder my son.<eos> Then you expect me to help you?
He raised their cancer drug prices by over 1,000%.<eos> This guy definitely needs to be locked up, but probably not for a terrorist attack.<eos> This is where we grew up?<eos> 15 Robin Hood Lane.<eos> According to property records, this is where Shepherd lived when she brought you back from South Africa.
I will protect you fiercely.<eos> And I will always sing to you when you can't sleep.<eos> And I will always be excited to hear you laugh.<eos> I bet you guys are gonna have wildly different laughs, huh?<eos> I love you so much it hurts, and I haven't even met you yet.
Oh, I knew it.<eos> I knew it. You see? I...<eos> See, this is what I've been telling you, D.<eos> The good guys, they don't always finish last.<eos> Ray sees either one of you again... he'll kill you.
This one.<eos> You're sure?<eos> Positive.<eos> When is the delivery staff expected?<eos> A little over an hour. Does that leave you.
I'm just concerned.<eos> That, as his handler, The other night when the two of you were... Together,<eos> Nothing's changed.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Heidi saw you in a compromising situation.
Did you sin too?<eos> Nobody sinned.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> My Lady the King's Mother.<eos> I've come to hasten you to Beaulieu.
Sir, be reasonable.<eos> Perhaps we should reevaluate our safety procedures.<eos> Or perhaps we shouldn't let children near dangerous machines.<eos> I got a better solution.<eos> One more mistake, Baudelaires, and I'm gonna send you away to a place where you'll learn the value of discipline and child labor.
Even if you were to get out of here alive, you'll never find it again.<eos> If you stay away from German villages and trains, I won't have to.<eos> Cross your heart and hope to die?<eos> A gentleman's agreement.<eos> If you let me go and stop illegal actions in this area, I won't send anyone to harm you.
Oh.<eos> Hey, if you learn to control that, you're gonna be a world-class badass.<eos> Hey, come on.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Are you sure he saw you?
Make no mistake...<eos> You choose to stay and you're choosing death.<eos> If that's your decision, I'm with you all the way.<eos> If not, there's the door.<eos> No one here will judge you if you leave.
Which war?<eos> The march revolution.<eos> A man sold us some land here.<eos> We came with 20 other families.<eos> Nobody told you about the Indians?
All the white people I've ever met tried to steal our land.<eos> And yet, I have never met a white man who didn't look surprised when I killed him.<eos> Please help me.<eos> Help!<eos> You deserve whatever happens to you!
The powder burned my eyes.<eos> I'm just now seeing clear again.<eos> So can we agree they could have come from anyone, anywhere?<eos> Who else besides your company wants us off this mountain with such fury?<eos> One Planet would not starve you from your home.
No.<eos> We'll use echolocation to find the leak.<eos> Each of us has a remote scanner which emits sound waves.<eos> They'll transmit data to my tablet, which will compute it and pinpoint the source of the problem.<eos> Okay, but if you need to inspect other sections of pipe, you let me know and I'll accompany you, 'cause it could be dangerous.
But Lorraine said she'd go out to lunch with me if I changed my vote, so here we are.<eos> - Phil, did... did you ever dream...<eos> - No.<eos> Last time I saw you, you came up to here.<eos> Okay, Claire will take you that way to the back yard.
Okay, this seems like a whole sidebar, so we're gonna circle back to that.<eos> Um, who do you want as Joe's legal guardian?<eos> No, no, don't think.<eos> Just answer, okay?<eos> If something happens to both of you, who do you want to take care of Joe?
You said this morning, Your Honor, this is not a First Amendment case.<eos> But I submit, in all due respect, now it is.<eos> A public apology and we'll call it even.<eos> No.<eos> What, you want us to pay you?
Because Google just changed its algorithm so the cucks wouldn't be offended that men invent...<eos> - and women barely contribute to soci...<eos> That's just one posting flagged as problematic by my moderators.<eos> Here are... 4,758 more.<eos> That's why I called you here today.
This is about Trump.<eos> This is about politics.<eos> Julius, this is about maintaining the integrity of this firm.<eos> No.<eos> I was loyal to you.
Forget Prior, Jack.<eos> I got to get this bomb out of this square before everyone dies.<eos> Give me a ride.<eos> Now.<eos> Didn't I disavow you people?
- Dr. Avery.<eos> It's not romance we're talking about here.<eos> It was emergency sex, and they were just too damn horny to remember the parking brake.<eos> That's super cynical.<eos> What is wrong with you people?
We're diverting all incoming traumas.<eos> Patients in immediate or impending danger need to be evacuated first.<eos> Unaffected areas... the E.R., radiology, nursery, daycare... they stay put.<eos> We have to prioritize.<eos> Firefighter Carroll here will be directing you to the most urgent areas.
-Stop talking.<eos> You had me at money.<eos> Discovery day is coming.<eos> Or haven't you heard?<eos> What's it going to take to wake you zombies up?
Have either of you gentlemen heard of the Spear of Destiny?<eos> The spear could alter reality itself.<eos> We broke it into four separate pieces.<eos> Mr. Hunter took one...<eos> And took the rest of you to three different time periods, which means the last piece unaccounted for must be with your grandfather.
I had to take that.<eos> There's only so many times you can tell the President of the United States that you'll call him back.<eos> You want to get to the point?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I brought you here to discuss a... sensitive matter, and it goes by the name of Malcolm Merlyn.
Her condiment game's on point, right?<eos> She even had gluten-free bread for me.<eos> Look, let's just get back to the ship.<eos> We don't know where the ship is, or Rip, which means our next move should be to rescue the Professor.<eos> Speaking of which, what did Thone have you to working on?
Not out of sentiment, of course.<eos> No, no, quite the opposite.<eos> But because it is so... delicious, knowing that you'll be forced to live your lives in a reality that I...<eos> Well, that we created.<eos> You will walk this world knowing that something isn't quite right, that for all your trying you only made things worse, and no one will ever believe you when you tell them about all the sacrifices you made
Martha's here.<eos> I'm so sorry, Alice.<eos> If there's anything I can do?<eos> That's not mine.<eos> Alice Dunn, Frank Camber, I'm arresting you on suspicion of murder and armed robbery.
No, I'm doing it!<eos> I think I have something!<eos> Supper at last! Oh!<eos> He's a sea monster!<eos> Lord. You said I should find you.
My husband does not see me.<eos> Then, he's blind or stupid.<eos> He is not blind.<eos> And he is not gentle, I would guess.<eos> He is the one who mistreats you?
Calm down.<eos> It's empty.<eos> - And you couldn't just tell us?<eos> - Are you trying to scare us?<eos> I'm maxing out your adrenaline. Fear keeps you fast!
Thank you, Doctor.<eos> For all that you've done.<eos> I'm sorry I didn't have more faith in your methods.<eos> Ah, don't mention it.<eos> Now I can set you down on a hub world outside of corporate control.
You need to get the kids to bed?<eos> That's OK.<eos> I'll give you a hand with bath time.<eos> Your husband is having a heart attack?<eos> Let me run you both down to AE, you lying shitbags.
I quite like it.<eos> Fancy a spin?<eos> Ooh, yeah. I've never been in a wankermobile before.<eos> I'll get me coat.<eos> Like I told you, page one of the training manual.
Well, maybe you don't go at the same time, but y...<eos> With the Morozovs and Pastor Tim and Paige,<eos> Beeman, and Henry and Paige going over there all the time...<eos> I... It's a lot.<eos> Is there something else bothering you that we should talk about?
Every time we saw them, they'd just... stare at us.<eos> They were lowlifes.<eos> They spent time in prison, I think.<eos> but we didn't do anything to them.<eos> The kids who used to beat you up-- were they their children?
Thank you.<eos> Will I see you again, then?<eos> Only if something urgent comes up.<eos> Um, the new person who's coming to work with you should be here in two to three months.<eos> Sometimes I hear things-- exactly the things I was asked to tell you about.
Sometimes I feel like...<eos> You have a lot to handle, but you're handling it.<eos> Look to your faith.<eos> Your faith will keep you strong.<eos> "Cast your cares on the Lord and he will sustain you;
I shall secure the safety of the Enterprise.<eos> Jinx.<eos> Captain. I must protest. I should be investigating that rift.<eos> Your protest is noted.<eos> If that ship fades away with me in it I'm gonna come back and haunt the whole lot of you.
Or is it both of you?<eos> At this point, it's everyone in town.<eos> - You have to go.<eos> - No. Why?<eos> No one wants you here. Do you understand that?
- Hold your fire.<eos> - Hold your fire.<eos> Pete.<eos> Get away from there.<eos> I don't know what my father told you, but you're all being lied to.
Let her go immediately.<eos> We have a problem.<eos> See, we had a deal in place.<eos> With Reiden?<eos> Whatever they told you, it isn't true.
I knew you both would be so desperate to prove you were right that you'd do whatever it took to find the device.<eos> So, you were lying...<eos> - the entire time.<eos> - To both of us.<eos> If I had told you I was innocent, you both would be so busy looking for the real killer that we'd have missed our chance.
I can't have any of my own.<eos> Would you like to come home with me?<eos> I love you so much.<eos> Ah! Everywhere's a nightmare!<eos> Wow, it's nice they put on a banquet for you.
I always wondered what was in them.<eos> This smells like Rajak root slime.<eos> Rajak root slime?<eos> That stuff's more potent than proton fuel!<eos> Man, I told you I make some awesome traps.
Wait.<eos> Jane.<eos> "The simplest answer gets you through the door."<eos> See?<eos> Told you I was great at puzzles.
- That?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Weller.<eos> It's the room next door.<eos> "That button leads you out, but watch the glass.
We're NYPD officers.<eos> This is an undercover operation.<eos> That's a lie, Peralta.<eos> You're the Golden Gang.<eos> We've been onto you for weeks, but we finally got you.
So get the kid with the two shirts to do it.<eos> Sir, I mean, if I may, uh, we've put a lot of thought and effort into this current prototype.<eos> It's a really elegant solution, and most importantly, it works.<eos> You both make excellent points.<eos> And thank you for presenting it so articulately.
- That's it?<eos> Just access?<eos> With Peter Theo's intel on your former boss, combined with whatever FSB has on him, the Russians can easily compromise the president, and he won't even see it coming.<eos> And once it's done, he won't be able to get out.<eos> Since my life is on the line, I just have to know... what are the Russians giving you for this?
- Schmancy.<eos> Well, then, seeing as how that's the case, are the keys in the rolls?<eos> Yeah. They're...<eos> Wait. Why?<eos> Because I'm going to drive it, and sergeant Poovey is going to drive you in my car.
Thou wrong'st him, Somerset.<eos> Was not thy father for treason executed?<eos> His trespass yet lives guilty in thy blood; And, till thou be restored, thou art a yeoman.<eos> My father was no traitor!<eos> And that I'll prove on better men than Somerset, and scourge you for this apprehension: Look to it well, say you were well warn'd.
Dispatch her straight.<eos> Will nothing turn your unrelenting hearts?<eos> Use no entreaty, for it is in vain.<eos> May never glorious sun reflex his beams Upon the country where you make abode,<eos> But darkness and the gloomy shade of death Environ you, till mischief and despair Drive you to break your necks or hang yourselves!
In your protectorship you did devise Strange tortures for offenders never heard of, That England was defamed by tyranny.<eos> Why, 'tis well known that, whiles I was Protector, Pity was all the fault that was in me,<eos> For I should melt at an offender's tears.<eos> My lord, these faults are easy, quickly answered: But mightier crimes are laid unto your charge, Whereof you cannot easily purge yourself.<eos> I do arrest you in His Highness' name...
For I should melt at an offender's tears.<eos> My lord, these faults are easy, quickly answered: But mightier crimes are laid unto your charge, Whereof you cannot easily purge yourself.<eos> I do arrest you in His Highness' name...<eos> Your Majesty!<eos> .. and here commit you to my lord cardinal To keep, until your further time of trial.
He hearkens after prophecies and dreams; And says a wizard told him that by G<eos> His issue disinherited should be<eos> And, for my name of George begins with G, It follows in his thoughts that I am he.<eos> This it is when men are ruled by women.<eos> 'Tis not the King that sends you to the Tower,
The first that there did greet my stranger soul, Shadow like an angel with bright hair dabbled in blood. And he shrieked out aloud<eos> "Clarence is come "That stabbed me in the woods by Tewkesbury.<eos> "Seize on him, Furies, "take him to your torment."<eos> With that, methought, a legion of foul fiends environed me And houled in mine ears such hideous cries That with the very noise I trembling waked,<eos> but that I was in hell. No marvel, my lord, though it affrighted you.
Wherein, my friends, have I offended you?<eos> Offended us you have not, but the King.<eos> I am his brother, and I love him well.<eos> If you be hired for money back again, And I will send you to my brother Gloucester And he will reward you better for my life<eos> Than Edward will for tidings of my death. You are deceived, your brother Gloucester hates you.
I want more uncles here to welcome me.<eos> Where are my uncles Rivers and Grey?<eos> Those uncles which you want were dangerous;<eos> Your grace attended to their sugar'd words, But look'd not on the poison of their hearts.<eos> God keep you from them, and from such false friends!
Because that I am little like an ape, He thinks you should bear me on your shoulders!<eos> With what a sharp-provided wit he reasons:<eos> So cunning and so young is wonderful!<eos> My lord, will't please you pass along?<eos> Myself and my good cousin Buckingham Will to your mother, to entreat of her To meet you at the Tower and welcome you.
The King's horse is slain!<eos> Rescue, else the day is lost!<eos> A horse, a horse!<eos> My kingdom for a horse!<eos> Withdraw, my lord, I'll help you to a horse.
Rocinante, you have been flagged for inspection per MCR Trade Regulation A0-66.<eos> Do not deviate from your present course.<eos> If you do, you will be fired upon.<eos> Watch your step.<eos> Worried about what's gonna happen when they board you?
But this is not a design I've seen before,<eos> - must be one of the newer.<eos> - It's not Martian.<eos> No one else builds stealth, no one else can afford to.<eos> This is what Fred Johnson sent you out here to find.
They stabbed me.<eos> Olly... he put a knife in my heart.<eos> I shouldn't be here.<eos> The lady brought you back.<eos> Afterwards, after they stabbed you, after you died, where did you go?
Shelagh, I can get the tents or the children in the car.<eos> But not both!<eos> May I refer you to my earlier offer to loan you my roof rack, which you declined?<eos> - You may.<eos> I left it out for you in the hall at Nonnatus House.
Goodbye, son.<eos> Bye, Dad.<eos> - Happy holidays.<eos> - You too.<eos> Hi, I'll be accompanying you...
- I still have the glass.<eos> I shouldn't have played amateur psychiatrist.<eos> - It was wrong of me.<eos> - It was fine.<eos> I'm only watching you two because I'm afraid that I can't catch this guy.
Go on.<eos> A falcon!<eos> A gyrfalcon.<eos> The greatest and rarest of birds.<eos> Last time I saw you, Baelish, you told me you were taking Sansa Stark home with you to the Fingers.
20 years ago, maybe.<eos> - What?<eos> - Our queen.<eos> She's wild, you know.<eos> Don't let her size fool you.
_<eos> _ _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Told you, I'm very attached to this knife.
I want to speak with you alone.<eos> Septa Unella has been my true friend and counselor.<eos> Oh, this is madness!<eos> You're not in your sanctuary now, my dear.<eos> All I have to do is whistle and my men will stroll in here and bash you about...
And if we lose this, we're gone.<eos> Dozens of tribes, hundreds of generations.<eos> Be like we were never there at all.<eos> We'll be the last of the free folk.<eos> That's what'll happen to you if we lose.
You have no support.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> Your brother's gone.<eos> The High Sparrow saw to that.<eos> The rest of your family have abandoned you.
Not anymore.<eos> Your brother's gone.<eos> The High Sparrow saw to that.<eos> The rest of your family have abandoned you.<eos> The people despise you.
Ser Jaime.<eos> We didn't know you were coming.<eos> 'Cause you didn't set a proper perimeter.<eos> You just allowed 8,000 men to approach unchallenged.<eos> Good thing we're friends or we'd be fucking you in the ass right now.
Have Lord Edmure bathed and fed.<eos> Walder.<eos> Edmure is a prisoner of House Frey.<eos> Only a fool makes threats he's not prepared to carry out.<eos> Now let's say I threatened to hit you unless you shut your mouth, but you kept talking.
Then why are you here?<eos> You know why I'm here.<eos> This castle belongs to House Frey.<eos> You're trespassing.<eos> In the name of King Tommen, I order you to surrender or...
Do you have two years, Kingslayer?<eos> You clearly have no intention of saving your men's lives.<eos> Why did you come treat with me?<eos> Sieges are dull.<eos> And I wanted to see you in person, get the measure of you.
Who is fighting in this army?<eos> The bulk of the force is made up of wildlings.<eos> Then the rumors are true.<eos> I didn't dare believe them.<eos> I received you out of respect for your father.
It's not even about the gods.<eos> It's about you.<eos> Learning you have to answer your prayers yourself.<eos> Seven save you, friends.<eos> How can we help you?
It's a surprise, and in all fairness... you two should've told me.<eos> Okay, dude. You know what?<eos> Sorry that we tried to fuck you.<eos> No. I... I didn't mean it-- Uh, it's just...<eos> I mean, maybe, like, one of you stays?
We've settled down.<eos> You'll see.<eos> What about this girl?<eos> That's Sana'a, the girl I told you about.<eos> Is she the woman who helps you?
In the ark, the uniform meant something different.<eos> Down here, it means what we make it mean together.<eos> My sister will understand that eventually.<eos> Pair up and fight now.<eos> Hey, sector 7, that puts you right at the ice nation border.
No... Arthur's got a big mouth.<eos> Arthur told Linda, Linda told me.<eos> - Polly?<eos> - Read the leaflet, Tommy.<eos> Ladies, why don't I talk to Tommy privately, then I'll report back to you faithfully.
Touching sentiment.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Where's Jim Gordon?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I would urge you to worry about yourselves right now.
There's nothing funny about my name.<eos> He was the one that framed Jim Gordon.<eos> You always were a smart cookie, Foxy.<eos> You know why Strange gave me this job?<eos> It's because he knows that I would kill you both and not bat an eye.
Come on.<eos> - Okay, so we found key number three, thanks to Scully.<eos> - I was gonna eat those peaches anyway.<eos> - That leaves just one more key.<eos> Team, what in this room is speaking to you right now?
We had fun planning for the wedding, didn't we?<eos> I love you, Fiona.<eos> My little girl.<eos> I always accepted you for who you are, with all of your faults.<eos> Accepted all of you for who you are, even when you couldn't find a place in your heart to accept me for who I am.
- Quiet! - Call the priest!<eos> - "Monsieur".<eos> Come on, we'll take advantage of the guard change. Let's go!<eos> Come on, come on.<eos> Rosa will guide you through the convent passageways.
Now you're talking.<eos> We'll go back, come on.<eos> We're going to die.<eos> - We're going to die.<eos> - but from the beating I'm going to give you.
Have you had this kind of premonition before?<eos> I do not like this mission one bit.<eos> A soldier like you is afraid of ghosts?<eos> I fear them more than the living.<eos> The living can be killed if they attack you.
I fucked it up, I'll fix it by myself.<eos> On second thought, I might need a little help.<eos> Amelia.<eos> Would you mind being my translator, please?<eos> Are you sure you do not want me to accompany you?
With regards to proof, it won't be the first time that we take action without having it.<eos> You know we always find it along the way.<eos> Yes, that's exactly what I was thinking.<eos> Fine, the time has come for our friends in 1924 to lend us a hand.<eos> - Relax, nothing will happen to you here.
- Hello.<eos> - How did it go?<eos> - Where did you go?<eos> Well, 1930, a class at the University of Salamanca.<eos> Did it not seem strange to you that the studnts laughed when the teacher started class by saying: "As we were saying yesterday"?
Make a decision.<eos> We want you to stay.<eos> Both of you?<eos> Well, I'll take you at your nod.<eos> There is something... else that I've kept you out of.
- Put me on speaker.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Button's right there.<eos> I know which button it is.<eos> Now, what I'm about to say might shock you, but I need help getting out of jury duty.
And I would just like to say to my beautiful daughter... and to all of you... we all have flaws... we all wrestle with demons...<eos> But- - I...<eos> But God... he loves us anyway.<eos> And he--<eos> And as much as God loves you all, I love you more.
He doesn't agree with Dr. Rollins and me.<eos> Okay, you realize what you're asking us to do.<eos> You want us to forgive Charlotte.<eos> I don't care if you forgive her.<eos> I'm asking you to give me my only chance at a real family.
We're sitting in a bar, in what used to be a squirrel factory.<eos> But no, like, an Electroshock Margarita?<eos> Manic depressive Mai Tai?<eos> You guys are seriously lacking in any good taste.<eos> That's why I love you so much.
Who are you talking about?<eos> Wilden.<eos> I'm gonna call Elliot.<eos> What's wrong with me?<eos> How are you gonna know that Sara's not following you?
The Principal has written, you're best off staying here.<eos> He claims you have caused trouble, but I'll get it resolved.<eos> - You've probably also found new friends. - We must get away from here now!<eos> If you will not help us, we must do it yourself.<eos> Of course I will help you.
Now what do you want, a kidney?<eos> I realized something during the dance.<eos> Life is short.<eos> We must savor every moment.<eos> I will no longer boss you around.
Our scientists.<eos> Is there anything else I can help you with today?<eos> We'd like to look around your facilities.<eos> - Do you have a search warrant? - We do not.<eos> Is there anything else I can help you with today?
Of course, the ACLU sees this, and I agree, as a potential contender to repeal the anti-miscegenation laws nationwide.<eos> I just need to get the ball rolling, as it were.<eos> It's a very delicate situation because by appealing, you open up the possibility of sending them both to prison.<eos> I think regardless, file the 1983 motion explaining your complaint.<eos> It'll force Bazile's hand and get you in front of a federal three-judge panel. All right.
Russia would blame the United States for not protecting its citizens, and retaliate.<eos> One homemade bomb from terrorists would've sparked World War III.<eos> Would have, but it didn't.<eos> Because none of this is real.<eos> But it will be, if you don't let me protect you from yourselves.
But it was your grandmother's spirit the whole time? Oh, yeah.<eos> I just smile whenever I hear that glass shatter.<eos> It just goes to show if we stop ignoring what is right in front of our faces, we might find the peace we're looking for.<eos> Thank you for your story, Greta.<eos> Remember, everyone, just because people tell you to shut up doesn't mean you have to listen.
We're going on the offensive.<eos> Temporary Resolutions.<eos> Starting at that office and working right up their chain of command.<eos> They can't get to Finch if we get to them first.<eos> Yeah, I love you too.
- Guy's name.<eos> - My name's actually McKayla.<eos> Steven.<eos> - What are you...<eos> - I followed you.
And the house explodes?<eos> No, no, the house occasionally explodes.<eos> This time it was the garage.<eos> You get used to it if you're...<eos> We haven't seen you in so long.
- Oh, my God.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Let me reschedule you.<eos> Hello.<eos> I didn't expect you. Is this Thursday?
But today I stand before you, as I've stood before many like you many times in the past to say in this city, in this community, in this church amongst friends and family of Talia Freeman<eos> that her death must be a call for change.<eos> Yes!<eos> Romans 12:14.<eos> "Bless those who persecute you," "bless and do not curse."
Have a little respect for your elders and betters.<eos> Gorrik.<eos> You're supposed to be the Reeve. Where have you been?<eos> Search them.<eos> Where's Roth? Where's the messenger I sent to Herot to guide you here?
They call him Red Tongue.<eos> They say he drinks human blood.<eos> The days of peace are over.<eos> As sure as the tide, war is coming.<eos> You'll give me my weapons at first light, or I'll keep your healer, cut your throats and tell Rheda the Sandwyrm swallowed the lot of you.
Well, tell my uncle I'll choose my destiny.<eos> And his.<eos> Go!<eos> Take care over the sands and on your journey home.<eos> These men will escort you.
Now!<eos> Fighting girls now, is he?<eos> And that looked more like the blacksmith was training the Huskarla, from what I could see.<eos> The order of the council is called to meet.<eos> I know you think I have failed you.
I vowed when I got older, I would have a hot fudge machine, and now I have one.<eos> And you're not gonna smear sheep's blood on it either.<eos> You know, you should not be out here so casually.<eos> Her book club is in there, and if one of those yentas sees you, this is all over.<eos> I assume that you've all read the book I gave you for this week.
See you.<eos> All right.<eos> _<eos> So, you think you discovered where we went wrong?<eos> You think you can do it better than the agents that came before you?
Jack Thompson.<eos> Jack.<eos> So, Vernon sent you to deliver the weapon, hmm?<eos> Not exactly.<eos> So he sent you to deliver bad news.
They will find Slean, I am certain.<eos> Admit it, you've lost the trail.<eos> I heard you could handle yourself in a fight.<eos> - Could? - Mm.<eos> All those years in the Farlands might have left you a little... soft.
- Have you met him?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - How many times?<eos> - Once.<eos> - Who introduced you?
Elizabeth, you've been doing this for almost 20 years.<eos> The job wasn't meant to be forever.<eos> So what, the Centre wants us to pack our bags and come home?<eos> You've had a good, long tour.<eos> The Centre would welcome you with honors the moment you tell them you're ready.
He doesn't have 30 minutes.<eos> His nerves are dying.<eos> If he doesn't get medical help, he's gonna lose his arm, maybe his life.<eos> I'm not a doctor, but my dad lost his leg, and I know that much.<eos> Your man, Primo, you think he can help you?
You got better things to do, Murphy?<eos> Oh, is that an offer, Mclntyre?<eos> You're an epic dick, Murphy.<eos> Everybody take your seats. Now!<eos> I'm sure all of you will be glad to know that we are officially done talking about Earth skills.
Votes for women.<eos> Rise up!<eos> Ladies and sisters, rise up!<eos> Rise up!<eos> I'm asking you to disperse.
That's a Babylonia Museum mark.<eos> So unless you've got paperwork, it's been looted.<eos> And since you're not involved in anything like that, I know you'd want us to call the Iraqi embassy for you.<eos> Professional ethics, and all that.<eos> Rich, I didn't properly introduced you.
The spirit... and the animal.<eos> You seek my soul.<eos> You my body.<eos> But both are promised to another.<eos> He who vanquished you.
Okay, fine.<eos> If you can explain to me why this is blue, I'll let it go.<eos> Everyone smile.<eos> Schrodinger's Cat.<eos> Ah, I can see I impressed you all with my artistic abilities.
The ludum regale was never meant to be just a fistfight.<eos> Aspiring leaders face off in a contest that requires cunning.<eos> Why?<eos> Because you want a leader with more brains than brawn.<eos> Reason I beat you all is because I know every nook and cranny in the Quarter.
Umm, were you guys looking......<eos> Get married...... tonight.<eos> Alison tells me you're now licensed.<eos> Wait, you wanna get married?<eos> You want me to marry you?
As long as you don't tell anyone that I thought you were...<eos> You know.<eos> I think that would be in both of our interests, Ms. Grant.<eos> And Kara, I was wrong.<eos> Now, that I've seen you both in the same room, you look nothing like her.
will receive their sacred arm rings.<eos> Kneel.<eos> Take this offering of earth and salt to remind you that you belong both to the earth and to the sea.<eos> These arm rings symbolize your coming of age.<eos> They also bind you in loyalty and fealty to me, your king and your father.
not to change sides.<eos> Not to betray us.<eos> In the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ, for the sake of Paris,<eos> do not return to your brother.<eos> I will not betray you.
Your Majesty, lords from the Southern Uplands have arrived unexpectedly.<eos> They claim to have something to show you, but won't say what.<eos> Scottish lords in French court?<eos> Your Majesty, Lord Rutherford.<eos> And what has brought you all this way?
Salud.<eos> Thank you, Duke, for embracing<eos> - our engagement so quickly.<eos> - The impending union of our nations is joyful news.<eos> King Philip sees you as an ideal alliance.
He wasn't as lucky as you.<eos> Where am I?<eos> You're outside a club called The Landing Strip.<eos> You and Julian came here earlier tonight.<eos> The two of you got into a fight with some of the bouncers.
We want our grandkids to know we did cool stuff.<eos> - Dr. Wells.<eos> - Henry.<eos> Welcome back.<eos> We weren't expecting you.
I'm graduating.<eos> That's the spirit!<eos> I don't like to play this card, But i am the patriarch, and i have spoken.<eos> Not much of a card, dad, 'cause i don't really care.<eos> So, how about the two of you get going, Because luke has a speech to work on?
It's -- it's --<eos> He's making him move out.<eos> That sounds like you.<eos> Hey, losers.<eos> Thought i'd see you down at the concession stand.
It is.<eos> Say we find the guns.<eos> How are we gonna get out of this, Rick?<eos> There is no way out of this.<eos> Let me put this to all of you as clearly as I can.
Money, obviously.<eos> You know, we could sound-proof the walls.<eos> Yeah, or buy earplugs?<eos> Or figure out how to get more food into that baby.<eos> Has she let any one of you hold her yet?
You made it into a competitive thing.<eos> We're both mad at Emery, I know, but at least we get to go to his matches and watch him win.<eos> Did you bring my glasses?<eos> Yes, I-I got them, I got them.<eos> Uh, I'm afraid I can't let you in.
In love with him?<eos> Me?<eos> What?<eos> I'm not in love with him.<eos> What's wrong with you people?
How do you think your clients will feel about their intimate activities...<eos> been filmed on hidden cameras?<eos> That must take a bite out of your business.<eos> Makes me think someone made you an offer you couldn't refuse, like, maybe, a certain assassin.<eos> Maybe these theories amuse you, but I have pressing shit to attend to.
- Holy shit!<eos> - I'm a little lost.<eos> - Heavy hacked the Hacks.<eos> Imagine if that got out.<eos> If that's all, Detectives, then Yolanda and Daisy will see you out.
We'll kill you all.<eos> - Oh my God!<eos> She's a demon.<eos> - Ash was telling the truth!<eos> - Yep, told you so.
- This beyond the pale.<eos> - More showmanship.<eos> You're not seeing with clear eyes.<eos> "When we are born, we cry that we are come to this great stage of fools."<eos> Arnold and I made you in our image and cursed you to make the same human mistakes, and here we all are.
Robert.<eos> I've told you, Bernard.<eos> Never place your trust in us.<eos> We're only human.<eos> Inevitably, we will disappoint you.
We never really connected.<eos> I...<eos> I wasn't prepared to raise a kid like you.<eos> There's no manual on how to raise a genius.<eos> If there were, I-I'd have read it a hundred times cover to cover, because I loved you from the moment you were born. I just...
Wait, wait, wait, you guys hooked up, right when Rebecca moved here?<eos> If you could call it that.<eos> I would call it... something that should never have been spoken of on a party bus.<eos> 'Cause I have spent a lot of time talking to both of you about whether you should date each other.<eos> Neither of you ever thought to mention you had already hooked up?
And I think I have just the outlet for the overwhelming pain you must be feeling.<eos> Since when do you eat disgusting garbage food?<eos> Since I stopped caring about getting that exact reaction.<eos> I have a question.<eos> If Rayna was chasing you through Europe in the 19th century, how exactly is she still alive?
And you and your ever-burgeoning eminence needs protection from him.<eos> So you think to end his misery.<eos> I do.<eos> And wish for my sanction. I do not require your sanction.<eos> The pair of you would have been ground down for bread had it not been for me.
First the can, then the preacher.<eos> Nice try, boys.<eos> Nice try.<eos> I don't know how you keep finding' me, but next time you do, you need to drive a different truck, you pair of idiots.<eos> Now, hold on. I killed you. How'd you do that?
Your money won't save you.<eos> Sex, love, romance... They will not save you.<eos> Your parents, your precious little children, that 55-inch flat-screen TV out there?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Nothing will save you.
Jesse, wake up.<eos> Jesse? Under the bed... right now.<eos> Stay quiet.<eos> Get out of here.<eos> Told you to stay away.
Okay, it's a cult.<eos> Little bit.<eos> My best is my best, and that's why I'm blessed.<eos> All right, everyone.<eos> Let the sound of the bowls wash over you, cleansing you from head to toe and everywhere in-between.
Today is September 23, 2044.<eos> The day I die.<eos> This didn't have to happen.<eos> It already did.<eos> If I die, my Daughters are gonna kill all of you.
- with Jayne Mansfield in it.<eos> - Whoa, hey.<eos> See?<eos> You do care.<eos> And whatever is stopping you two, it isn't worth it.
Calista!<eos> What a pleasant surprise.<eos> Diamond?<eos> All right, this is an even more pleasant surprise.<eos> What... what brings the two of you here to my humble digs?
We told them about the explosion.<eos> They figured it came from that, but they didn't ask about it, no.<eos> And you didn't think that was weird?<eos> What's weird? Huh?<eos> Why did Borns Tech's insurance pay you off?
All right?<eos> You're just...<eos> You're chipping away at all the good.<eos> And at the end of the day, there's gonna be nothing left but the bad.<eos> And then let me tell you what happens.
All right, bring it in.<eos> All right, bring it in.<eos> All right.<eos> Pass that around.<eos> I want all of your electronic devices, anything that connects you to the outside world-- your cell phones, tablets, your fitness bands.
Could be our guy. Stand down.<eos> Have them stand down.<eos> We don't have aviation up yet.<eos> Let it go.<eos> I'm telling you, those bombs are already unstable.
Since when are you even up in the morning?<eos> I'm surprised you're awake now.<eos> Hey, I'm pretty sure the guys didn't come here to watch you two kill each other.<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> I didn't accidentally butt-dial you or anything, did I?
Hey, we're fine.<eos> We're in three whole pieces, more or less.<eos> It's okay.<eos> It's not okay.<eos> He almost killed you for what I did.
Everything went real smooth.<eos> Put the shit in the hull insulation.<eos> When?<eos> Soon.<eos> What did I tell you about keeping this quiet?
A special thanks to all those who volunteered at St. Anthony's bread line during the week.<eos> A reminder that the Ladies Auxiliary will be having their bake sale this Sunday, and a special collection box has been set up in the back of the church to replace the money that was stolen from the rectory after last week's Mass.<eos> May almighty God bless you, in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.
Yes, Buzz Watson, Major Crimes.<eos> Can we have building maintenance up here, please?<eos> Thanks.<eos> You think you feel bad now?<eos> Wait till you hear what the homeless man who saw the two of you fight told us.
So... scotch?<eos> God, yes.<eos> - One of his favorites. A classic for a classic.<eos> Hear, hear.<eos> Well, I know it's getting late and I know some of you have a very long ride home.
- One of his favorites. A classic for a classic.<eos> Hear, hear.<eos> Well, I know it's getting late and I know some of you have a very long ride home.<eos> I want to thank you for your friendship and for being here.<eos> Richard loved you all very much.
- I agree.<eos> Rory, that's food you eat at the carnival or in a Turkish prison.<eos> You're gonna love it.<eos> - But... - Listen, just leave it up to me.<eos> You guys go back into the living room, and I'll call you when it's ready.
I did.<eos> I... I let her do it.<eos> So, now, all these years later, how do you feel about that?<eos> It was in the cards.<eos> Lorelai and you, from the first moment I saw you two together, no one was getting between you guys.
Thanks.<eos> -But I do not want to leave anyone out.<eos> Is there anyone little here today? Anyone at all?<eos> - We're little! We're little! - Oh!<eos> I did not see you there.
You sent a vulnerable, wounded turtle into a nest of horny, gray-haired honey badgers.<eos> -I thought she would play backgammon!<eos> -Now, thanks to you, she's out there sipping a gimlet with Jack the Zipper.<eos> You're missing this.<eos> I told Grandma I'd meet you at the cemetery.
...about a lot of things.<eos> Okay, so we go in, explain to the blobby dude that we blew up his gift to save his life, and leave as heroes.<eos> I am also going to ask Father to grant the miners full Spartax citizenship.<eos> I figure he cannot say no in front of the Council.<eos> You sure you don't want us with you for moral support or backup?
Emphasis on Thanos.<eos> Remember?<eos> Of course.<eos> Is why Cosmo allowed you to try this.<eos> Cosmo will send you where most cosmic energy is.
You made sure of that.<eos> Now I'm just plain old Robbie Rogers from Massachusetts.<eos> An American who serves his country.<eos> You want reward, you take him to Jameson, not Arnold.<eos> He'll pay you this time.
Please explain.<eos> We've already explained it.<eos> A simple prank is a strong prank.<eos> - Uh-huh. - Okay.<eos> Let's just say... I don't know, I told you that I cut my pinkie finger off, and then I actually cut my pinkie finger off.
Oh. Like a... Like a dinner party.<eos> We're not doing that again.<eos> Just takeout.<eos> Whatever.<eos> Just come over at 8:00, and I'll feed you.
Is it about Mary?<eos> Is she all right?<eos> She's fine.<eos> This is actually about you.<eos> I gave my word to Mary that when I returned to England, I would help to free you.
And he's asking me, as a fellow Protestant, to help support him when Mary's Catholic followers resist.<eos> Elizabeth, you cannot be on his side, no matter how badly you want to weaken your rival.<eos> His hatred of women in power is unparalleled.<eos> But you already know that.<eos> And you know that I would never advise you to do something against Mary, so why are you bringing this to me?
- What are we doing?<eos> - You pick one of us!<eos> - Gosh damn it, boys!<eos> What are we gonna do come Christmas?<eos> I loved you!
- Ah! It worked! - Go!<eos> It worked!<eos> It worked!<eos> The spell is broken and we live again!<eos> I better never see you in this museum ever again!
But Mary's alive.<eos> We don't know that for sure.<eos> Several Scottish lords have already agreed to back me as their ruler.<eos> We received word from Edinburgh.<eos> What does Mary ask of you?
- Your Majesty.<eos> If your intention is to take Mass, I must remind you that it is forbidden by the Lords of the Congregation.<eos> But I am your queen.<eos> I have returned and I will practice my faith.<eos> But you can tell the nobles who alerted you to my activities this afternoon that I have no desire to impose my religion on anyone else or to impede the worship of theirs.
The Catholics who lived there fled.<eos> The Catholics who murdered their neighbors?<eos> I don't even know if locals from my parish did it, because I wasn't there.<eos> I'd taken a retreat, seeking silence and prayer.<eos> Please tell me that this retreat was at a monastery where people saw you.
Count on my help, Majesty.<eos> My soldiers are expert on missions like this.<eos> Will your source, this Leith, be waiting at La Clusaz?<eos> He will.<eos> France thanks you for your advice and assistance.
Anyone?<eos> Uh, yes, that would be good.<eos> So what do you need from me?<eos> We were just discussing strategy.<eos> What do you think of the kids joining you at a press conference?
You're lucky they don't know who you really are, they might not look at you so warmly.<eos> Come with me.<eos> Munro's waiting.<eos> This is Pauline and Pierre.<eos> What a terrible welcome Scotland has shown you both.
Let's see how it looks on you.<eos> Sorry, I'm just a little nervous.<eos> Don't be afraid.<eos> Even a warrior's touch can be gentle.<eos> That wool merchant does not deserve you.
It's from Mary.<eos> What's this gold for?<eos> To bribe my way to safety once...<eos> It's written in Mary's code, but what she's asking me to do...<eos> What does Mary ask of you?
1943, Gyeongsangnamdo Province Geohchang<eos> Not yet.<eos> Come out, come out wherever you are.<eos> Hey you guys are too much.<eos> I told you it's no fun if you go too far.
1991, Gyeonggido Yangpyeong Dumulmeori<eos> Such a young visitor.<eos> Is that your mother next to you?<eos> Yes.<eos> So, who brought you here?
A blood vessel in her brain burst.<eos> Would you like to see her?<eos> I would.<eos> Okay, sure.<eos> Give us a few minutes and we'll bring you back.
Smiling, laughing.<eos> She was strong.<eos> And you're strong.<eos> And she was brave, and you're brave.<eos> I know you didn't think much of her, but... she loved you.
- I love you.<eos> - ‚Ä≠I love you, too.<eos> And I love you both.<eos> It's the only good thing about me.<eos> I love you both.
Jake's pretty amazing.<eos> So, tell me everything.<eos> Where and when, deejay or band, casual or black tie? Oh.<eos> Um, we haven't really nailed down all the details yet.<eos> Oh, if you want, I have tons of wedding books I could give you.
Looks like you got it all figured out.<eos> W-W-Why are you doing this to us?<eos> W-W-W-W-W-W-W-Why?<eos> Why? Why? Why?<eos> Because you guys can't give me one decent day, no matter how many chances I give you!
Sit down, you need to rest.<eos> Em...<eos> God, I'm so sorry.<eos> For what?<eos> Elliot knew that I'd push you away and make myself vulnerable.
I just... wanted you to know how grateful I am, to both of you, to be your son.<eos> Barry, you're scaring me.<eos> No, there's... There's nothing to be afraid of.<eos> Promise.<eos> I just... I love you both.
Thank you.<eos> Thank you, thank you, thank you.<eos> It's good to see all of you.<eos> We love you!<eos> I love you back!
"You'd have liked him out of your life, but she wouldn't "do that, would she?<eos> What did that feel like, Leo?<eos> "Like a betrayal?"<eos> "How many times have you met Frankie Alder?<eos> "Your wife tells me she introduced the pair of you.
I asked him, just to be sure,<eos> I said, "Can you hear my questions, Leo?<eos> Can you hear me?<eos> Laura?<eos> "You told us the bank collapsed and the river took the both of you, "but that's not what happened, is it?"
- And Laurel.<eos> Laurel's in the hospital.<eos> When's the last time you saw them all?<eos> Before Annalise called us.<eos> Annalise called you?
- Where are you going?<eos> - Don't walk away.<eos> I don't know what to do!<eos> That's the truth.<eos> Sometimes I lie to protect you, to keep you from worrying, because I know it can drive a person insane.
I'm not gonna marry either of you.<eos> I'm not even a prince anymore.<eos> I'm done with it all.<eos> So do what you want to me, but let my friends go.<eos> They never did anything to hurt you.
I've met some smashing people, Ethel.<eos> I think you'll like them.<eos> Would I get an insurance payment if I killed you, Arthur?<eos> Well, we'd have to get married first.<eos> You won't find anyone to marry you now, although some say that James Doyle, of The Bull, used to be Father Doyle.
- Dad sent me.<eos> No.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> This is me and Dad's day.<eos> Well, I guess he just realized how much he hates you.
- the security company patrol schedule.<eos> - Oh, eat shit, Pope.<eos> Okay, that's enough.<eos> What about the other guard?<eos> Are you sure he can't ID you?
Goes double for me.<eos> What'd you say to him?<eos> I told him you find him sexually attractive.<eos> And, uh, can't guarantee I'd be able to protect him from the blue-eyed devil.<eos> Duggan already kick you out?
I can't.<eos> I can't. So it's like, "Yeah, maybe you're tired all the time "because you're sick, Lee-Ann, or maybe you're depressed because you live in Reno."<eos> What just happened? Somebody cut the power.<eos> Time's up.<eos> Looks like Figgis found you.
Okay.<eos> - Is that it?<eos> - Yes, thanks.<eos> Hey, everyone.<eos> For those of you who haven't heard,
We're ready, Don Pietro.<eos> Guys, I didn't pretend to be crazy all this time just to get caught or get shot.<eos> I gotta leave here, but from this moment, here in Naples you're my eyes,<eos> my hands, my heart and my anger.<eos> And I assure you of one thing:
The guy in the Brandon James mask!<eos> Where did he go? Wait.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Your friends said they saw you walk into the woods. Are you okay?<eos> So, you're telling me that you all got together for a big party, but someone, who wasn't here, dosed you? - That's your story?
- Come with me.<eos> Come with me.<eos> Come with me.<eos> Guys, I appreciate that you want to help, but all I need right now are Hunt, Wilson, and maybe cardio and neuro.<eos> So, the rest of you can go. Wonder why you wish your life away - Don't!
Hot water?<eos> Thank God!<eos> Don't got to clean my flaps with disinfectant wipes no more.<eos> My family and unbathed brethren, we have won the first battle for homeless dignity by staking our claim.<eos> We demanded our 40 acres and a mule, our three bedrooms and a toilet, and yours truly has delivered it upon you.
Now that's how you dress in the South of France.<eos> - Pleasure.<eos> - How do you do?<eos> Oui, Madame.<eos> So... what brings you two out of sunny Berlin?
Game over.<eos> Nobody wins.<eos> The best I can hope for is a cell with a window.<eos> And let Shaw live on with a global audience?<eos> No. "And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free."
Give me the baby!<eos> All rightsky, should we get started?<eos> Em, here you go, Max.<eos> What, like a hot-potato situation?<eos> Before the baptism, the father will question you about guiding the spiritual life of the child.
Guess you're gonna have to trust me.<eos> Remember to chisel that into my tombstone.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Thanks, Francisco.<eos> Took you long enough.
Good point.<eos> New deal.<eos> If she loves you enough to sacrifice her hand...<eos> Twinsies... In exchange for your life.<eos> I swear on the memory of my beloved Isabella, I will set you both free.
The fake Wells.<eos> I know your fears and I know your weaknesses.<eos> I know you better than you know yourselves.<eos> I know your destinies.<eos> One shall betray you.
I'm gonna talk to some witnesses, and pull yourself together.<eos> You look like a homeless magician.<eos> Well... hello, bridesmaids.<eos> So, which one of you horrifying zombettes wanted the bride dead then, hey?<eos> Surely she put each of you through hell.
Angel.<eos> Wipe their memories.<eos> U.S. government plates.<eos> Elite dogcatcher level.<eos> Someone special wants you.
No.<eos> Rejoice, brothers.<eos> Now we must rebuild.<eos> Seventeen years ago, you made me your Abbot.<eos> The first thing I told you is that I would never abandon you.
- You haven't take our statement.<eos> - And I won't.<eos> Mari has decided not to press charges.<eos> And don't look at me like that.<eos> If it were up to me, I'd do you for vandalism, forced entry, theft, and, if it were a crime, for being sons of bitches.
Now we can be done with him.<eos> Why didn't you tell us sooner?<eos> We're family.<eos> We could have figured it out together.<eos> He threatened to cut off every other finger on all of our hands if I told you.
- Abigail.<eos> - And tell your parents you don't want to go to this fancy school.<eos> Use whatever excuse you got.<eos> You got bullied by a kid.<eos> A teacher diddled you.
Go, Mom!<eos> Thank you, Patty.<eos> Um, well...<eos> I work and I am a mom.<eos> And some of you might later in life find yourselves in the same situation, I hope.
It's used to measure somebody's mental agility, their observational skills and their ability to multi-task.<eos> It's actually based on a machine that's used to test fighter pilots who want to join the Royal Air Force which, as we all know, is the finest and greatest air force in the world.<eos> What do you mean, "Boo"?<eos> What do you mean, "Boo"? What?<eos> If that was true, we wouldn't have to help you every time you get in trouble.
We gonna do it like that.<eos> Just remember, you remember this:<eos> You make any money, you bring that shit back to me!<eos> 'Cause that's my money!<eos> I break you off, nigga!
- You're finally back.<eos> - Yeah, too bad it's like this.<eos> - There was no other way.<eos> Don't trust Ciro Di Marzio, he's using you to cause havoc in our clan.<eos> But then he'll throw you away, like a used condom.
It was for a great cause.<eos> He was a natural.<eos> - Neil is my future husband!<eos> - I know.<eos> I don't care what it looks like to you.
- For what?<eos> To sneak us across the border.<eos> You're already across the border.<eos> No, the, other side.<eos> You want me to sneak you into Mexico?
- We did good, Frankie.<eos> - We did.<eos> - That we did.<eos> Who is this?<eos> Hi, yeah. How long will it take you to get a room ready?
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Whoo, I know you boys must be tired of me wiping you up on the court every day.
Big plans.<eos> Red here is gonna meet a guy in the desert who is going to help us change everything!<eos> You said that I could have Rainey's body.<eos> I want one of the good bodies, like the original souls get.<eos> I am sick and tired of Rainey treating you like you're disposable, putting you for years into dogs and-and birds.

The Gospel according to Matthew, chapter 25, verse 31.<eos> When the Son of Man comes in his glory with all his angels.<eos> "He will sit on his glorious throne.<eos> "The King will say to those on his right<eos> "Come, you who are blessed by my father. "Take your inheritance, "the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world.
What is she to you?<eos> She's the reason I'm alive.<eos> Now...<eos> Hester.<eos> If you do this, it will only make them hate you more, fear you more.
Your brain, Miss Quill.<eos> Best weapon there is.<eos> Look at you!<eos> What an amazing team!<eos> You'll be able to handle anything that time throws at you.
- Is a coach really a teacher?<eos> If I never see you again, my life will improve a good 30, 35%.<eos> And you... what a disappointment.<eos> Get out of here, both of you.<eos> Wouldn't want anything weird to find you.
Yeah, I'm pretty clear on the brain-frying.<eos> That's why I've got this look on my face.<eos> You're not seriously thinking about picking it up again?<eos> Not me, one of you.<eos> You can do it for a few seconds, it won't hurt you before that.
Have you ever cried during sex?<eos> What's going on?<eos> Have you ever cried during sex?<eos> Who are you?<eos> Who sent you here?
It was real.<eos> I was just too ashamed to admit the truth earlier.<eos> So, it wasn't a dead body?<eos> No.<eos> Your father loved you all so much.
With live coverage from the Mars Mission Corporation's mission control center in London, and an optical feed from the Daedalus itself, at a 10 minute, 20 second delay.<eos> We had survived a 209-day journey through deep space.<eos> But landing a 14-story ship safely, upright, and on target on the surface of Mars?<eos> That was a whole different kind of challenge.<eos> Um, by the time this message reaches you, whatever is about to happen already has.
You ready for this?<eos> Are you?<eos> Put your helmets on and seal your kits.<eos> Daedalus descent to the surface has been initiated at 425 kilometers altitude.<eos> By the time this message reaches you, whatever is about to happen already has.
That's incredibly... clever... of you.<eos> But, hey, it's my job now.<eos> Well, this was fun.<eos> Hey, guys, want to hit Big Wang's or something?<eos> Get a couple drinks in me, I might tell you what Brick's about.
Don't worry.<eos> We all think so.<eos> And Helen wouldn't be annoyed to hear it.<eos> She knows what she's got.<eos> Who did you say introduced you?
Well, we think we can help you,<eos> Sergeant Masood, and that's why you're here.<eos> Thank you so much for taking us.<eos> My wife is very persuasive.<eos> She persuaded me to come here and persuaded you to accept me.
We have a deal with The Butcher, and she's gonna get you back.
Please, please just let us go.<eos> We will go back to California and no one will ever see us again.<eos> No, they won't, sweet meat.<eos> The Polks have always been as good as their word.<eos> We have a deal with The Butcher, and she's gonna get you back.
He's being modest.<eos> Not only does he keep this place running,<eos> I bet he could tell us the exact year it was built.<eos> 1949.<eos> Told you.
Can't we get through one day in the Apocalypse without getting shot at?<eos> I won't hesitate to shoot you.<eos> Lucy needs some new friends.<eos> What do we do with them?<eos> You two try anything stupid or even look like you're gonna try something, I will mercy you in a heartbeat, and never mind the mess.
I got a couple questions.<eos> And if I don't like the answers,<eos> Ma here is gonna shoot you.<eos> We may seem like simple country folk and you think you can fancy talk your way out of this.<eos> I want to disabuse you of that notion.
They protect her and keep this place safe.<eos> Do some of the chores too.<eos> It's a little slice of heaven we have here.<eos> Which is why we don't like strangers coming to our door.<eos> Now, finish what you were saying about Mr. Murphy supposedly sending you.
- So then you'll give it to me?<eos> - Yes.<eos> So just give it to me now.<eos> Do you think I'm dumb?<eos> You get it when I see you and your friends at the group meeting.
- Vilde.<eos> So I thought I'd explain what kind of vision we have.<eos> We have our group meeting 3 weeks before the others because we are an important aspect of the theatre. More than, for example, PR or costumes.<eos> We thought it's best to have a good system throughout the entire theatre event.<eos> That's why we'll divide you into groups.
Welcome, my young apprentice.<eos> I trust you found the Sith holocron illuminating?<eos> I don't see our friends.<eos> They will remain my guests until we conclude our business.<eos> I will take you to them now.
We should not be opening our arms to them.<eos> We should be locking them up and taking their weapons away.<eos> You did not heed us, but you will heed the chaos that amnesty has brought.<eos> You will pay the price in fear and blood.<eos> And you will beg us to save you.
Maybe it's disgrace... shame... mortality... or your past.<eos> Maybe you're easy to manipulate.<eos> Or maybe you're plagued with doubt.<eos> Whatever it is, identify it, accept it.<eos> Your greatest weakness can't be conquered, but if you embrace it, it can't kill you either.
You did the right thing, man.<eos> Daddy, are there still reporters outside?<eos> I don't know, sweetie.<eos> I hope not.<eos> Well, there might be a few. You want me to have an officer escort you out?
Bill Keirstead ran into the rubble without any regard for his own safety and rescued our only survivor.<eos> Our nation thanks you, and I thank you.<eos> My Secret Service code name is Phoenix.<eos> But as most of us know, there is only one man who truly rose from the ashes.<eos> And though it might seem odd to some of you to award someone for simply surviving, Congressman Peter MacLeish's story is anything but one of simple survival.
But, Tandy, you told us he was dead!<eos> Guys, guys, guys, relax, okay?<eos> Pat is very dead.<eos> No, Tandy, we got to come clean.<eos> Listen, Tandy lied to you because he didn't want to scare you.
I went down like a dog.<eos> Like a downward dog.<eos> Oh! Sun salutation!<eos> Oh, that makes me feel better.<eos> I'm gonna see you later.
Honestly, it's advisable to be nice with you.<eos> I'm standing in front of the future political class of this country.<eos> It depends on you whether I could have pension, the public health would work, and whether education would have any more reduction.<eos> One thing... In class, I won't give any homework.<eos> That's right. You will have to consult the recommended reading that I'll give you.
I drive a saloon car.<eos> James drives a catering lorry.<eos> And Richard has a knife fight.<eos> Let's dance.<eos> That is all to come, but first of all, let me talk you through where we are.
One's now in a lion and the other's in prison.<eos> Let's get back to what we were doing.<eos> Earlier on, we were at a Jordanian special forces training base learning to be super army soldiers.<eos> And we pick up the action as we rush towards the hijacked airliner to rescue a VIP and take them to safety.<eos> Let me talk you through the plan.
Come on, Doc.<eos> You're the one who dangled the carrot.<eos> Erin is my patient, obviously she has issues.<eos> If I was looking into what happened, suicide wouldn't be the first road I'd go down.<eos> That's all I'm telling you.
Tactical information...<eos> What he was and wasn't saying.<eos> But sometimes you need to go further...<eos> Much further.<eos> Enhanced interrogation techniques will also be used on you if you're ever caught, so today we're going to teach you how to survive, evade, and resist them.
I even looked in here.<eos> I couldn't find anything about this document.<eos> What's that?<eos> This is Lucy's journal.<eos> What... she never told you about it?
Ho, there. Who might you be, fair maid?<eos> I am the Princess Snow White.<eos> I have traveled this land and many others, and never have I seen a beauty so fair.<eos> Where are you from, noble sir?<eos> What errand brings you to the forest?
It was, in its own way.<eos> I also said let's never speak of it again, remember?<eos> So, what was all that about?<eos> Is there something we need to know?<eos> Yes, but I need a surgeon to officially assess you, and I can't seem to get one.
In our line of work, you must always assume someone is watching.<eos> Even when you're the watcher.<eos> Surveillance is the foundation of intelligence gathering.<eos> It requires patience, focus, and awareness.<eos> And while other agencies like the FBI or NSA may emphasize how to run surveillance, we at The Farm also teach you how to avoid it.
I'm Angie, one of your instructors.<eos> It seems like you're the last recruit to not have opened your new bank account for Agency activity.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't know I was supposed to.<eos> Lydia said she mentioned it to you this morning.
Whatever she needs, she gets.<eos> You will leave them be.<eos> Please.<eos> So... I work with attending surgeons.<eos> I train attendings to train you, and the best way I know how to do that is to hear from you about them.
Sometimes I... paint.<eos> Now, no one knows this, not even your Aunt Kate, but... when I get a script, the first thing I do is just sort of paint the way it makes me feel.<eos> I painted this after I read that play for the first time.<eos> So...<eos> I think I scared you before.
Neither with you nor with any girl.<eos> You don't know about the troubles that people who are in love have.<eos> Just look at Joan and Monica.<eos> I'm in love with Nicola.<eos> Then I hope it goes well for the two of you.
But he asked me a favor. Come.<eos> Can you see me?<eos> Yes.<eos> What's up, Merl√≠? We can see and feel you.<eos> I see you now.
And take more care of Pau.<eos> I'll be careful.<eos> You have a rather strange way of showing it.<eos> How can you doubt that I love you, Marc?<eos> - Of course I love you.
Last night, you made a horror show,<eos> - You sneaked in the school.<eos> - We didn't sneak in.<eos> Yeah, we already know how you did it.<eos> We won't expel you.
Okay.<eos> Okay, uh, new deal.<eos> The next natural step in our no-plan plan will be the plan phase.<eos> Oh, come on, guys,<eos> I am telling you, Tampa would make a great place to live!
All right, come on girls, backpacks, lunches, car.<eos> Let's go.<eos> I'll be right out.<eos> Have a great day, beautifuls.<eos> - Daddy loves you.
We look out for each other.<eos> Thing is, we're not even supposed to be here.<eos> We just want to go home.<eos> Now, you can kill them, and I'm pretty sure there is nothing I can do about it, but if you do... you're gonna have to kill me too.<eos> My brother says to kill you all.
Shepherd and Roman framed Douglas Winter.<eos> This is the beginning of Sandstorm, and Winter,<eos> Winter was the inception point.<eos> Does this mean they tried to kill him, too?<eos> Wait, could Sandstorm have been the ones that attacked you at the safe house?
Is it possible that he's using that to bypass the firewall?<eos> I mean, it's theoretically possible.<eos> You think he's in your apartment?<eos> How else would he know what kind of beer I have there?<eos> - Hey, what took you so long?
The Akkadian has injected me with a neuro-toxin that will slowly kill... that will slowly kill me.<eos> He's leaving three vials.<eos> One is an antidote.<eos> The others will kill me instantly.<eos> Leave Rich alone, and he'll tell you which one to use.
Not even once.<eos> - On a broken foot, you walked.<eos> - Not Henry.<eos> Not your daughters.<eos> Bet she didn't tell you... she scraped the first one out.
But I am.<eos> Hey.<eos> Come here.<eos> It's okay. All right?<eos> I'm not gonna let anything happen to you.
The bowling alley in Hollywood.<eos> - I was with Willow.<eos> - Got there around 8:00, I think.<eos> And we left around 11:00.<eos> And that's when Maya called you.
But you survived.<eos> Yeah, great.<eos> Now what? I don't know.<eos> We're gonna figure it out.<eos> I thought I told you...
- Please, please, no!<eos> - Please. - Do it, Case.<eos> Oh!<eos> - Seven. - And your mom,<eos> - your mom loved you too.
America, and the lie it sold for centuries that there's such a thing as freedom and it only exists here.<eos> So that's your enemy?<eos> - Freedom?<eos> - We have no enemy.<eos> Only empathy... for all of you fighting the endless civil wars this country has kept you in every single day, the same civil wars we escaped from back home.
Really?<eos> What, just by coincidence we show up and hit the exact same bank at the exact same time?<eos> Well, I guess so.<eos> - Thanks for screwing it up for us.<eos> - We screwed it up for you?
- I know you.<eos> - I seen him talking to the cops, Clyde. - Me?<eos> The cops are on their way to this cabin right now because your friend...<eos> Henry, is it?<eos> - Sold you out!
That's not true, Bonnie.<eos> - We just came for the necklace.<eos> - That's all we need.<eos> You can go back to your lives.<eos> I ain't just gonna give it to you.
Please?<eos> You really want to risk killing George Washington?<eos> - What the hell is this?<eos> - When he comes in, just nod and follow my lead.<eos> Or else I'll have Washington hang you for treason.
I'm sorry, sir.<eos> Did he tell you how I admire his military genius?<eos> How when the war is over, I will give him a place near me at the table of elders?<eos> I'm honored, sir.<eos> But did he also tell you about his alcoholic father?
Eat, drink, be merry.<eos> It's all on Carlos.<eos> Delightful.<eos> But be ready.<eos> A car will pick you up at 6:00 a.m.
The music we play is mournful... and tears flow, itching our cheeks with sorrow.<eos> We do not forget that our beloved Empress has departed this world for one of eternal bliss.<eos> She's left us far too soon, but I take great comfort that her soul resides in eternity, watched over by all the Gods in the Elysian Fields.<eos> Now as we prepare to light the pyre that usher her into the afterlife,<eos> I ask only one thing of you. That you remember her as I do.
The Emperor needs civilian governing apparatus. And that apparatus, that governmental structure, had to have leaders.<eos> The answer was the Senate.<eos> Made up of 600 men of the elite class, and with seats passed down through generations... the Roman Senate is responsible for maintaining the treasury, holding trials, and advising the Emperor.<eos> I humbly thank the Senate for its time.<eos> May the Gods be with you.
Preserving peace and order.<eos> You were tipped off.<eos> - You knew we were here to meet El Toro.<eos> - Se√±ora.<eos> If El Toro's people saw you here, they would've assumed we said something.
Their office is a stone's throw away.<eos> Eh, more like a cannon's blow.<eos> Look, good-byes are always hard.<eos> Yeah, I always find the Band-Aid approach to work the best.<eos> There's just a few words separating you from your freedom.
I'll spare you the details.<eos> - Come on, we're gonna be late.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> I hope everyone had a relaxing weekend, because we have a very big mountain to climb.<eos> What I'm about to tell you cannot leave this room.
So take the periscope out of your asses and look at the warhead of shit that's coming at you.<eos> Hey, Dobby the house elf, we've had enough.<eos> - Just get out.<eos> - Okay.<eos> You can wave bye-bye to the Families First bill because the lawmakers in these districts are going to Vulcan death grip you to fuck.
And in January when we have it and we come to market, you won't just be frozen, you'll be dead.<eos> You played your best hand, Richard, and you lost.<eos> It's just business.<eos> So... wouldn't you rather get something out of Pied Piper while you still can?<eos> - Let me acquire you.
But I bought your pitch.<eos> Yeah, you fucked up, too.<eos> My app is still great.<eos> But in the time that we've been clicking around with Pied Piper, ten other apps that basically do the exact same thing have come out.<eos> Guys, if I list you as references, can I count on you to say nice things about me?
I look like I'm in a failed boy band.<eos> Forget the picture.<eos> Enjoy this.<eos> A straight-to-series pickup...<eos> There are 300 TV writers who hate you today.
Chateau Margaux '53.<eos> I'll have a snort.<eos> Look, ahem, they're dissolving the agency.<eos> All the business is moving to McCann.<eos> They finally got you.
I'm still the boss here, so, yeah.<eos> Okay, great, thanks.<eos> It's great to be here.<eos> As Olof said, I am here to change this bank's image.<eos> So, here's a question for you:
You know you are.<eos> And that's why I give you this advice.<eos> The Cardinal is finished.<eos> He'll go.<eos> And then you will be without a master to protect you.
What?<eos> Not more gossip from the silk merchants?<eos> Rumour is the King has moved from Mary Boleyn to her flat-chested sister.<eos> Anne?<eos> She hasn't forgiven you for that business with Harry Percy.
You are my father now.<eos> So, shall I change my name to yours?<eos> Your father?<eos> Every day I light a candle for him.<eos> Does that comfort you?
~ You know it wasn't simple.<eos> Well, perhaps I am a simple person.<eos> Do you feel I am?<eos> You may be.<eos> I hardly know you.
You may be.<eos> I hardly know you.<eos> You may go.<eos> Lady Mary.<eos> God, I thought she would slap you.
No, ring a bell.<eos> Ice sculpture.<eos> I don't do any of that.<eos> I'm just waiting for a friend, okay?<eos> Oh, so, Ben told you about his date last night? Oh! - Come in!
Rukmani said however deep a matrimonial bond may be... The world always remembers the beloved.<eos> Radhe Krishna, Radhe Krishna! (Famous devotional chant)<eos> Kashi, you are as dear to me as Mastani.<eos> Lord Krishna also said the same.<eos> I have never compared you two.
I'm gonna end it with her.<eos> This is the 19th lie in 6 minutes.<eos> I can't even do the division on that lie.<eos> It's so sick.<eos> When I picture the two of you, I get sick.
Trying to stop us from reaching Andy, like she did last time.<eos> Felix, do something!<eos> Divinity of the Elements, I summon Thee.<eos> Water, Fire, Earth and Air, aid in my quest<eos> - I call you forth.
- A true Alpha doesn't let others do his dirty work for him.<eos> A true leader doesn't just seek glory for himself.<eos> He focuses on what was accomplished.<eos> Not who accomplished it.<eos> I think I've indulged you enough here, and answered your questions.
I'm Lily.<eos> I'll be right back to take your order.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> When the Mutts attacked you here, how did it feel?
No...<eos> No.<eos> Because you're beautiful.<eos> You listen to me carefully.<eos> When I first saw you two, I was... so taken.
I don't know how to explain it.<eos> It was like... like I was seeing old friends.<eos> It was like I was coming home.<eos> Do you really think we're beautiful?<eos> Why do you think I chose you?
Those were good people!<eos> I'm good people, too!<eos> I was just doing what God put me on this earth to do.<eos> You ca... you... you can't punish a man for fulfilling his purpose!<eos> Please... please... my darlings... I forgive you for all of this.
Okay, but we spent hella skrilla on this trill forest, so, what are we supposed to do with that?<eos> Here's a far-out idea that just came to the top of my branium:<eos> why don't you donate that land to the National Parks Service?<eos> That would be pretty dope.<eos> And you could get some baller tax breaks that could help you with that mad stank construction cost--
Hit men?<eos> Doctors.<eos> You guys are doctors.<eos> We build things.<eos> Come on, let me show you around.
Everyone is happy.<eos> What do you mean, "secrets are cleansed"?<eos> The two alphas smoke the root of a blue calamus flower.<eos> It links your hearts and minds together.<eos> The ceremony won't take if there are lies separating you.
Previously on "The Originals"...<eos> So I got to ask, when's this wedding?<eos> 10 days.<eos> After that, Hayley's power is your power.<eos> The full moon won't control you anymore.
To Dahlia, any act of betrayal is punishable by death.<eos> Dahlia is my cross to bear.<eos> She has no grudge against anyone but me.<eos> Did she ever speak to you about the curse she placed on this family, the one that said she can take the firstborn of every generation?<eos> Yes, but why should that concern you?
Here you go, sweetheart.<eos> Assembled dignitaries.<eos> Rebecca and I are so thrilled to have you all here to celebrate with us as we embark on this new life together.<eos> As you know, Becca and I go way back.<eos> Our parents will tell you that they arranged our marriage when we were both zygotes.
So?<eos> I'd polish up that resume if I were you, Ford.<eos> Can I have one of those?<eos> Get the fuck out of here.<eos> What the hell is wrong with all of you?
A reality-altering storybook to power the magic and software...<eos> Morgan Le Fay, really? Oh! We never did have that conversation.<eos> And from the brilliant mind of Nikola Tesla, a dimensional stabilizer.<eos> And the ball of twine from the Labyrinth of the Minotaur.<eos> The clipping book sent you all to get these things,
And Whispers... knows me.<eos> Be careful what you tell them.<eos> Not too much, or they won't believe you.<eos> He's here with me now.<eos> He wants me to tell you that he's going to Iceland, that he's going to find Riley, and once he does, it won't be long until he finds the rest of you.
Needs shoeing.<eos> I'll need to see the smithy in the morning. Aye.<eos> I'll take a look at him for you.<eos> - I'm good with horses. - Aye.<eos> And we wouldn't want anything to keep you from yer travels.
Fire! Fire!<eos> Aye.<eos> More.<eos> Fire!<eos> This family's taken you in, Given you food, shelter.
Yes.<eos> This is his home now.<eos> Aw, I'm so happy for you guys.<eos> Blink if you're being coerced.<eos> I've got a great idea. Why don't I make up for last night and take you all out for breakfast.
I imagine I will walk today, yeah.<eos> If I am late, it is her fault. [Sighs]<eos> Think you might have gotten me hooked on this stuff. Oh! [Chuckles]<eos> Y'all two consulting without me now? No, I just had some questions, is all.<eos> So, uh, the reason that I called you in is because a spot has opened up in the clinical trial of a new potential treatment.
See you later.<eos> Is it me, or is that weird?<eos> These telemarketers are relentless.<eos> Dad, how come it's your week but we're staying with mom instead?<eos> She didn't talk to you about that?
- Are you kiddin' me?<eos> - Juliette, please, just... just listen.<eos> No, that's enough!<eos> I've been out on the road absolutely killing' myself to relaunch my career!<eos> A career, which I might point out, supports all of you.
You are the only man I have ever wanted.<eos> Take me.<eos> Make love to me.<eos> And I love you.<eos> Oh, God, how I love you.
I think he might be ill.<eos> He's burning up.<eos> He needs a doctor.<eos> Spanish agents in Paris?<eos> A joke is being played on you, Sire.
Breeding shows even in the vilest company.<eos> I have something for you, Sire.<eos> My ring!<eos> You kept it safe.<eos> My company does not please you.
You've brought me back.<eos> I left this life... .. a long time ago.<eos> What gives you the right to bring me back?<eos> We need your help.<eos> You don't need a lord to tell you how to work the fields.
You won't betray me.<eos> Father Allard.<eos> You were privy to all the Cardinal's secrets.<eos> I want to know about Milady de Winter.<eos> You were the Cardinal's man, Rochefort. Didn't he tell you?
Tell me and I will spare your life.<eos> Perales.<eos> It was Perales.<eos> Ambassador.<eos> This was just delivered for you.
I am as loyal to France as any of you.<eos> There is not a drop of French blood running in your veins.<eos> Who puts a fox in a hen house?<eos> Why are you really here?<eos> ~ We've told you...
Go ahead to these gates and make sure the carriage is ready.<eos> I don't want the Ambassador waiting out in the open.<eos> God has shown me what to do.<eos> You will return to Paris.<eos> Aramis will escort you.
Aramis will escort you.<eos> There is one condition for your release.<eos> The King must grant me an audience.<eos> I will do everything in my power.<eos> Tell the King we treated you fairly.
One we deserved.<eos> You destroyed my mind to grasp it.<eos> Just go home!<eos> You have been deceived.<eos> Listen to your own hearts, not to those who would corrupt and mislead you!
You have been deceived.<eos> Listen to your own hearts, not to those who would corrupt and mislead you!<eos> Go home.<eos> Pack your things and leave.<eos> You have one hour before the Red Guard puts you to the sword.
Take me right here.<eos> It don't matter if she's a cocktrough whore or dressed up like a dog's dinner.<eos> You can't tell a thing by looking at 'em, fellas.<eos> They maybe got it, and maybe they don't.<eos> But these will keep you from getting the bug no matter what.
- Who?<eos> Your sister.<eos> In a matter of speaking.<eos> Oh, look.<eos> Here's the Chamber of Horrors I was telling you about.
By the next morning, you'll all be famous.<eos> What do you want from us?<eos> We can't stop the trial.<eos> But your fellas can.<eos> I doubt you was letting penniless shine boys put the bat in the cave, so I want you to go to these powerful fellas who emptied their bags in you and let them know that they can either use their money
The Gothic Genre.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Guys, look, I get it.<eos> Nobody wants to sit around reading 500 dusty pages about monks and curses.<eos> But nobody's forcing you to watch "The Walking Dead." Ooh. - Is "The Walking Dead" on the midterm?
It was the King's choice that sealed their fate.<eos> It had nothing to do with fate.<eos> You murdered them.<eos> I take no pleasure in their deaths.<eos> What happened to you?
~ Your Majesty. ~ We thought you were dead!<eos> ~ Are you all unharmed?<eos> ~ We are quite well. ~ And the King?<eos> ~ Alive when we left him.<eos> ~ If I hadn't found you in time...
Balance.<eos> A harmony in nature.<eos> A shout of defiance in the face of an indifferent universe.<eos> If I'm going to die for a cause I'd like to know what it is.<eos> Does the name Gerberoy mean anything to you?
Athos.<eos> Oh, Your Majesty.<eos> Thank God you're safe.<eos> It's good to see you, Captain.<eos> God was watching over you, Your Majesty.
You have suffered too much in my service, Constance.<eos> I am sorry for it.<eos> I'm only glad to see you and the dauphin safe and well.<eos> Why does everyone hate me?<eos> The people love you, sire.
Well, at least it got you out of bed.<eos> I got out of bed... so I could join y'all for church. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, what?<eos> God damn it!<eos> Michael: A reading from Thessalonians.<eos> "Now we ask you, brothers, to give recognition to those who labor among you and lead you in the Lord and admonish you."
His secret is moisturizing.<eos> So you have family around here?<eos> - Sorry?<eos> - In Jarden.<eos> I figured someone must have tipped you off about the house.
She posted it all over the web.<eos> You lied about it and now you feel guilty.<eos> There, we talked.<eos> You're right.<eos> I didn't stop Nina from filming you and I should have.
Christ will help us with these decisions.<eos> He will be the guide.<eos> Luke 11.9...<eos> Jesus tells us, "keep seeking, and you shall find."<eos> "Keep knocking, and the door will be opened to you." [Knocking on pulpit]
- Mmm. - What happened to Pepper?<eos> - Well, she's consistent.<eos> - And dirty.<eos> Hey, boss man. What are you doing here?<eos> Well, it turns out I wasn't so sure about my sure thing, so I thought I'd come by and keep you company.
I can't... always be available.<eos> You know what.<eos> Your brother said exactly the same thing.<eos> Thanks for coming so quickly.<eos> Let me introduce you to Andrew St. John-Paine.
- Maybe it's on an Indian burial ground.<eos> Oh, shit, maybe it's on Oscar Newman's list of alternate sites for public housing units.<eos> Ma, we ain't taking no.<eos> Now, this is what they call an "intervention."<eos> So, I'm 47 years old, raised both of you out of diapers and piss pants, and now you intervening in my life?
Um, by the way, how is the filling up of your roster going?<eos> Is that going okay?<eos> It's an invitational.<eos> We don't have to follow the strict "show choir" rules.<eos> Has it occurred to either of you that this could be a really awful idea for your team?
Let me bring him in, see how he does in a formal interrogation.<eos> Knock yourself out.<eos> You're wasting your time.<eos> Mike's not gonna show.<eos> I told you, I haven't seen him.
Santiago money stretches far.<eos> As in stretch limo airport pickups far.<eos> I know, tacky... But oh God I love it.<eos> I came here first.<eos> When you guys weren't here, I tracked you down.
We moved him after the last sweep.<eos> You should go there next.<eos> All right.<eos> Go on.<eos> Vincent will take you.
Listen to me.<eos> It's gonna be ok.<eos> All right?<eos> You're gonna be ok.<eos> We're not gonna let anything happen to you, will we?
He's also won three Oscars, two Golden Globes, a boatload of Grammys, and his music has been featured on everything from The Simpsons to Goodfellas.<eos> And you can't help but grin when you listen to his music.<eos> His songs are uplifting and theatrical and optimistic.<eos> We need to soak up all his uplifting energy as we get ready for Sectionals.<eos> Which are five weeks away, but I guarantee you, Vocal Adrenaline and the Warblers are doing everything in their power to regain their former glory.
And I will be damned if I let my dads go through with this.<eos> Hey, guys, hey.<eos> Thanks for coming.<eos> Oh, for the love of all that's sacred, what now?<eos> Uh, well, I called you here today because of Rachel.
So can you help us?<eos> You'll have to calibrate the mass spectrometer. If you want to run this sample.<eos> I trust you know your way around a processing lab.<eos> Alan:<eos> Sure do. I'll leave you two to get reacquainted.
Rebekah's buried deep.<eos> Eva will not give her up without a fight.<eos> Then she gets a fight. Be careful.<eos> You're entering Eva's mind.<eos> If she kills you in there, you will be lost, and if you kill her before you free Rebekah, then Rebekah will be gone forever.
I can see your red door swinging wide open, but our job's not yet done.<eos> Shall we kill her and be done with it?<eos> To be clear, I do want her blood, but I want it on this blade, which I've had bound with the soil from Dahlia's homeland, not to mention viking ash.<eos> Mother's demise will have to wait.<eos> You see, I need her to weaken Dahlia's defenses, bit of psychological warfare before I slaughter the both of you.
We can go back in.<eos> I got to call you back.<eos> There's something I got to go see.<eos> I've been gone, and I'm sorry, sorry for what the city has had to endure in my absence, but you did endure it, and the evidence of that struggle is lying at my feet.<eos> You did not fail this city, and I promise I will not fail you by leaving it again.
Oliver would not even know what's happening to him.<eos> I don't care!<eos> Oliver, he is stronger than that!<eos> I did not come here to debate.<eos> Laurel insisted that I bring this news to you myself, but I can see all I'm doing is damaging your memory of him.
What do you want to hear?<eos> Nothing.<eos> And I don't want you to tell anyone about this, especially Laurel.<eos> And why is that?<eos> Because she loves you like a sister, and it would hurt the both of you too much.
But we have bigger problems.<eos> It hurt feeling and broken trust.<eos> Laurel needs to contact her father.<eos> Ray needs to find a way to counteract the virus.<eos> I'm sure Malcolm told you... We don't have a lot of time.
Wally's death made you a fortune.<eos> Marvin likely figured out how much you were worth, got greedy, demanded more money.<eos> So you killed him, tied up the loose end.<eos> Who is this Marvin Webster you keep talking about?<eos> The dead man who called you on two occasions just before you ran him over in your newly purchased
No need.<eos> I'm with zoe now, i am settled.<eos> None of you has any hope of a romantic future with me, And, uh, well, i don't want to be leading you on.<eos> Well, a-all right then.<eos> That's why we called you here.
Okay, all due respect, there is no possible way anybody could be trying to kill me over a drug debt.<eos> Are you denying that you use drugs?<eos> Okay, hey, you guys... you guys are obligated to protect me, all right?<eos> That means you're protecting my personal life and my political career.<eos> So anything that I say to you...
‚ô™ From pulling that shiv ‚ô™<eos> ‚ô™ And a hernia the size of a doorknob... ‚ô™<eos> Stop, I'm gonna pee.<eos> You guys are a bunch of assholes.<eos> She never did anything to any one of you.
Well her teachings were in conflict with the values upheld by this school.<eos> That's not true.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Mistress Acacia taught us to be proud of our powers, not shame them, like you do!<eos> Mistress Acacia led you astray.
You.<eos> I've... I've seen you before.<eos> Yes.<eos> But I wasn't doing very well.<eos> Until I saw you.
We were in cheerleading together.<eos> Sort of.<eos> - Crickett, maybe we should just...<eos> - We are here to make amends.<eos> Well, there's no need, since I have no memory of you.
Go.<eos> Hi, Marjorie.<eos> Us again. I know you didn't<eos> - remember us earlier...<eos> - Of course I remember you... how could I forget the way you evil queen bees treated me?
He's starting to panic.<eos> Lillian, I'm planning a seduction.<eos> A seduction.<eos> I remember those days.<eos> A cocktail at the bar, a conversation held only with the eyes, and then the two of you retire to the bathroom.
Shoot us.<eos> Okay, look, I'm not a handyman, although that was my nickname one summer on Fire Island.<eos> We're friends with Kimmy.<eos> She asked us to come here to...<eos> Wait, wait. Kimmy let you in?
Yes, you would suggest that, Richard Riche.<eos> I remember you as a youth and you were ever a creature of vice.<eos> But I will not be such a juggler.<eos> I have respected you.<eos> Since I was a boy, I have respected you.
I asked you what was in the book... ..and you said...<eos> "Words...<eos> "..words...<eos> "..just words."<eos> As I have already told you, I have no recollection of meeting you then.
I don't doubt his loyalty to Rome, or his hatred of Your Majesty's title as Head of the Church.<eos> However, legally, our case is slender.<eos> It won't be easy.<eos> Do I keep you for what's easy?<eos> Do you think I've promoted you for the charm of your presence?
That is what you said.<eos> I will take my oath on it.<eos> Your oath?<eos> Your oath isn't worth the Devil's fart!<eos> Christ help you, Riche, I have known you since you were a child, you were the despair of your family, you were a gambler and a waster.
You said she was having an affair.<eos> Marisol, you've got to find out who she was sleeping with.<eos> You said she's one of your best friends.<eos> How would you get it out of one of us?<eos> I would take you out, ply you with alcohol until you opened up.
I was parched.<eos> Rosie, what are you doing here?<eos> Are you having an affair with Mrs. Taylor?<eos> No. Why would you ask that?<eos> I took Miguel to the park today, and I saw you together.
It's refreshments for the Queen.<eos> Take a look.<eos> We must get you away from here to a place of safety.<eos> - I need to be with the King.<eos> - Rochefort is a Spanish spy, he will destroy you.
That makes no sense. If the King dies, the Queen becomes regent.<eos> Rochefort loses all his influence.<eos> Not if the Queen is blamed for her husband's death.<eos> He wouldn't dare.<eos> He's accused you of treason. Why not murder as well?
You have until dawn tomorrow to consider your position.<eos> Marguerite's reply to our note.<eos> What news of the King?<eos> She doesn't say exactly, but he must be recovering.<eos> She's arranged a private audience and will lead you to him.
No, to you.<eos> To your freedom. Shh! My toast!<eos> Thank you, guys, for all the care packages and the letters that came every day.<eos> Words can't express how amazing it is to just be standing here with you.<eos> I thought I loved you before, but when you think that you'll never have something again, you just... you know.
Hey, what are you guys doing here?<eos> Just grabbing a quick bite.<eos> We try and meet a few times a week.<eos> Andy wants us to see each other as much as possible.<eos> So what brings you to this part of town?
Well, she said something real interesting.<eos> She asked me if I thought that you were just marrying me to get back at her.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> This was a bad idea.<eos> I knew I shouldn't have gotten the two of you...
Then you really shouldn't have gotten involved.<eos> You really should have left everything alone.<eos> - A-and you're just going to...<eos> - Just stayed in Milwaukee.<eos> Nobody wanted you here.
He's strict.<eos> Everybody's got to pitch in and work.<eos> Well, he's a communist.<eos> What's a communist?<eos> What do they even teach you in school these days?
What an extraordinary conversation.<eos> Turnips and mangelwurzels. 12 hours a day.<eos> Still, it's scarcely the Somme.<eos> Good God!<eos> Let me have a look at you.
Metadata's been scrubbed.<eos> It's a dead end.<eos> You are responsible for this bombing.<eos> You could've prevented it if you'd just left your cell phone at home.<eos> Your addiction to technology is going to kill you.
Thank you, sir.<eos> Now get that brat before he injures himself.<eos> It's also been my dream to meet Shah Rukh.<eos> If I didn't have these tomatoes to deliver<eos> I would have taken you all the way to Jaisalmer.
Are you mad?<eos> He is mad!<eos> Grandma said that a "fat, strange man will help you".<eos> Good luck then.<eos> May Goddess Kali protect you.
By sleeping with someone who's got her own private aesthetician.<eos> Did my two sides of beef come in?<eos> In the back.<eos> Oh, morning, boss.<eos> I need you two on deliveries today.
With the war, I find my brother foremost in my mind.<eos> Of course.<eos> I wish you to go to the front. Shadow my brother.<eos> See no harm comes to him.<eos> I think I understand you.
I think I understand you.<eos> Well, it's been a long time.<eos> I will do as you ask.<eos> That's the Rohan I remember.<eos> Misery suits you.
You're kidding, right?<eos> (sighs) look.<eos> My boss is a major pain in the ass,<eos> Does a lot of spot checks.<eos> Unless a tenant invites you in, This is as far as you go.
I don't have anything, man.<eos> You don't have anything?<eos> A coin, anything?<eos> No I don't.<eos> You will know the truth and the truth will set you free.
I'm losing my head. Where's this going to take me, man?<eos> Where's this going to end?<eos> Believe in who?<eos> How can I believe in someone that was never close to me?<eos> You will know the truth and the truth will set you free.
Did you... Or did you not...<eos> Kill... Lila? Answer the question.<eos> I found the campus cop.<eos> This car one of yours?<eos> She asked you to go into her house and burn a rug for her?
I believe that person is you.<eos> Then you will join us?<eos> I will extend my stay in Rome.<eos> I suggest you use the time to convince me.<eos> That bastard sent you, didn't he?
And he would rather die than be part of this...depravity.<eos> As would I.<eos> - No.<eos> - Do not fear!<eos> Leonardo Da Vinci will save you.
- Franck!<eos> - Yeah?<eos> They've just released the Belairs.<eos> We need to find them.<eos> (IN ENGLISH) Who sent you, huh?
A visit from the Queen will revive his spirits.<eos> His mood is delicate.<eos> He's plagued with fears.<eos> Can't you do something, Rochefort?<eos> The King will listen to you.
It might have been stolen.<eos> Or the killer was a member of the Red Guard.<eos> I have more than 500 guards under my command, unless you've killed any in a bar room brawl today.<eos> Do you think you could be a little more precise in your accusations?<eos> It doesn't concern you that there is a traitor amongst your own men?
I thought you were my wife, Madame Bonacieux.<eos> Ah, you are Constance's husband.<eos> I am Bonacieux, the finest cloth merchant in Paris.<eos> Then it's you I'm looking for.<eos> She asked me to tell you she will meet you at home.
D'Artagnan will be waiting.<eos> Let the world say what it likes.<eos> I will receive you both at court, and then no one will dare gossip.<eos> Your Majesty, don't let Rochefort stop you seeing the King.<eos> He needs you now more than ever before.
You say you loved his mother.<eos> What happened?<eos> She came to this house as a servant.<eos> We fell in love and married in secret.<eos> After you were born, my father discovered the truth, and ordered me to cast you both aside.
Take your revenge.<eos> I want the truth now. Every word of it.<eos> It's true. De Foix and I left you in that terrible place.<eos> He begged us to do it.<eos> His father was going to disinherit him and Belgard said he'll kill you both himself unless we took you away.
Rochefort, is everything all right?<eos> There is a matter that I must discuss with you in private.<eos> What is it?<eos> What is this about?<eos> A gift I gave you many years ago, when I was your tutor in Spain. A jewelled crucifix.
Stop it!<eos> Pa might arrive any minute.<eos> That's enough!<eos> Stand up, the pair of you.<eos> What will your father think if he comes home and finds you like this?
We're with the F.B.I. I'm Agent Lisbon.<eos> This is Patrick Jane. Who are you?<eos> Austin.<eos> You've come a long way.<eos> Uh... Hope that nothing serious brought you down.
If they can't see you... they can't kill you.<eos> It seems we have an unexpected visitor.<eos> I'm here to apologise... ..for the way I acted.<eos> I can see now that I made a terrible mistake.<eos> But if you can find it in your hearts to forgive me... ..I know I can make it up to you.
According to the Mask, a man named, uh, Leland Owlsley runs the books.<eos> But since getting roughed up by him,<eos> Owlsley's been surrounded by Fisk's security.<eos> Can't get anywhere near him.<eos> Same goes with, uh, James Wesley, the guy you said hired you to defend Healy.
- I did.<eos> - What'd he say?<eos> Just that... it was his fault.<eos> Got that right.<eos> What is going on with you two?
Father...<eos> Glory will soon be mine.<eos> I think I'm injured.<eos> Cower before your King... torch of Apollo!<eos> The blinding staff of truth will sweep you all into the sea!
Rafael's problems with Xiomara didn't phase him were that they seemed slightly insignificant compared to the fact that his father could be Sin Rostro.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> Yeah, I, uh, I know you were hired to do the bathroom work at the Marbella.<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> Just hoping that maybe if you could tell me who hired you,
(clears throat) jane, It is an honor and a privilege for me to be here today.<eos> It's a moment that I've waited For the two-and-a-half months I've known you.<eos> I myself Never attended college, no.<eos> Preferring instead the school of hard knocks,<eos> Where there are no weekends off... (cell phone rings) I believe I asked you to turn off your phones.
Okay.<eos> Cool.<eos> These are a bunch of at-home techniques you can try.<eos> I can't promise they'll work, but give them a shot.<eos> And I'll see you in two weeks.
Let's walk.<eos> Let's walk.<eos> Good.<eos> I should have called you.<eos> I feel terrible for how much money this is costing you.
Yeah, that's a pretty big thing for her.<eos> Cisco, what happened out there?<eos> I followed your directions exactly.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I led you the wrong way.
Hurry!<eos> Come on, come on.<eos> Stop!<eos> You're gonna kill each other, is that what you want?<eos> Listen to me... you have the power to fight whoever turned you into this, both of you do, but not if you kill each other.
Risking your lives to save us.<eos> I just hate Elroy.<eos> That clown's a worse tipper than you.<eos> Seriously.<eos> Your parents, they raised you right.
No!<eos> Stop it!<eos> So tired.<eos> Cobra, I've found some class pussy.<eos> Get out, I don't need you anymore.
Shit!<eos> This is it. Game over.<eos> Nana.<eos> I'm sorry I didn't mean to deceive you.<eos> I can't allow you in here.
The winner is...<eos> Marlon Brando in The Godfather.<eos> PRESENTER: Accepting the award for Marlon Brando in The Godfather, Miss Sacheen Little-feather.<eos> Hello.<eos> I'm representing Marlon Brando this evening and he has asked me to tell you that he very regretfully cannot accept this very generous award.
Mazel tov.<eos> What?<eos> Oh, right.<eos> Thank you.<eos> First, let me put you at ease about the baby's herniated diaphragm.
Very like a family, in fact.<eos> And like all families, we have our disagreements.<eos> Congratulations on being chosen for the choir, everyone, and well done for getting here on time.<eos> We're just going to rehearse for half an hour before you all set off for school today.<eos> Mrs Willens will have some hot Ribena ready for you when we finish.
Yes, that'll be the one.<eos> If the case is in doubt, sir, may I look into it?<eos> I don't think you have a locus standi in the matter.<eos> God, let him, Harry.<eos> By the time this fellow's finished, the Breton'll be paying you.
Find a way into her confidence, Tom.<eos> Work a device to please her.<eos> The only way to please that lady is to crown her Queen of England.<eos> ~ ~ Will you come north? ~ Mm-hm.<eos> I'll come and fetch you, as soon as he summons you back.
Nonsense.<eos> Your master may be down, but you're not poor.<eos> And you've got everything below in good working order, haven't you?<eos> Alice!<eos> What have I told you about drinking wine?
And you've got everything below in good working order, haven't you?<eos> Alice!<eos> What have I told you about drinking wine?<eos> Your nose is glowing!<eos> Why am I bringing you to Westminster?
Of course, I can't get any sense out of her, she cries if you look at her sideways, so I don't know who put it there.<eos> That's the Queen, Katherine, you see?<eos> And that's me.<eos> Anne sans tete.<eos> I am told that Wolsey kept you because you always knew the London gossip.
"Never mind who grudges it, this will happen."<eos> I mean to have him.<eos> I think this is the one that cries, so don't look at her sideways.<eos> ~ Master Cromwell.<eos> ~ I haven't seen you for a long time.
And the city officials came to view his body so there couldn't be any false rumours that he'd escaped to France.<eos> They... they made jokes.<eos> They made jokes about his low birth!<eos> Come, Wolsey!<eos> We're fetching you to Hell, where our master, Beelzebub, is expecting you to supper!
Your lawful wife, Anne Boleyn, skinning and jointing that rabbit.<eos> Yes, I wish you all happiness.<eos> You were never pre-contracted.<eos> Any understanding you think you have, you didn't have it.<eos> And if you think Lady Anne loves you - well, you couldn't be more mistaken.
I've just come from her.<eos> She hates you.<eos> She despises you.<eos> She wants you gone.<eos> So if you say one more word about Lady Anne's "freedom" with you, I will come and drag you out of whatever hole you are cowering in and the Duke of Norfolk will bite your bollocks off.
I had to, Thomas.<eos> I couldn't live with what I'd done.<eos> When you're examined...<eos> I'll say what I will say before my last judge - that the Eucharist is only bread, we have no need of penance and Purgatory is an invention ungrounded in scripture.<eos> If some men come and tell you to go with them, I want you go with them.
I'll relish taking the ten pounds from him.<eos> And what will you wear?<eos> Oh, they're making me something, Meg.<eos> If I avoid getting laughed at, it'll be enough.<eos> I heard the Holy Maid - the Barton girl - has been to visit you.
And she makes sure we are.<eos> I think she'll soften, now she has her heart's desire.<eos> This is my humble face.<eos> Will it serve?<eos> I think it would take you anywhere.
We're not disappointed, Rita.<eos> We're devastated.<eos> She's our daughter.<eos> And she's doing this out of obligation, or fear, because she does not wanna be taken out of our house again.<eos> Or that's what she's telling you, so you won't get hurt.
And she's doing this out of obligation, or fear, because she does not wanna be taken out of our house again.<eos> Or that's what she's telling you, so you won't get hurt.<eos> - We're already hurt.<eos> - Yes, I can see that.<eos> But wouldn't you be even more hurt if she told you she did feel a connection with Robert, because he is her birth father?
- What?<eos> - Are you kidding?<eos> - Disappointingly, the new administration at Anchor Beach wants me to teach you how to take tests, not how to think.<eos> And I won't do that.<eos> You all have vibrant and brilliant young minds, and I encourage you to use them.
But what they didn't take into account is the power of us.<eos> So grab a box, guys.<eos> Start pulling anything you think is relevant.<eos> And you may have to work pretty hard, but it will free us from this lawsuit.<eos> Are you saying, "work will set you free"?
Sometimes I think she understands me better than you do.<eos> Shogun!<eos> _<eos> Sorry to keep you waiting.<eos> Had I know you were here, I would have met you at the door.
You realized you could grow to love me.<eos> Oh, would you please stop putting me in this position?<eos> Don't make me always have to be the bad guy.<eos> Well, I, for one, am willing to put in the work in this relationship.<eos> You'll see. I'm going to wear you down.
Don't make me always have to be the bad guy.<eos> Well, I, for one, am willing to put in the work in this relationship.<eos> You'll see. I'm going to wear you down.<eos> You're going to grow to love me just like Pearl did. You're unlovable, Richard.<eos> Pearl only loved you because your parents paid her to.
‚ô™<eos> We've been riding for days.<eos> The horses need to rest.<eos> We'll stop here.<eos> My people will treat you like a princess, Princess.
Careful, princess.<eos> You're getting dangerously close to paying me a compliment.<eos> I can do compliments.<eos> I mean, you know your way around a horse, you're not so bad with a sword, and your beard magically stays the same length all the time.<eos> And... you have an ability to see the best in people even after they've wronged you.
Madalena.<eos> Oh, man, this robe is really itching my junk.<eos> Oh, you left your clothes on underneath.<eos> Right.<eos> I hope you're pleased with what I've shown you.
And the real question is, why do you still love her?<eos> I mean, yes, she's beautiful, in a perfect-skin, perfect-body, perfect-hair kind of way, if you're into that sort of thing. Mm.<eos> I know you, Galavant.<eos> I know your heart, and you deserve better.<eos> You deserve to be with someone who will lift you up as a man, someone who will fight with you, not against you.
I failed in my mission, Gareth, and now it's our last night before we have to duel to the death.<eos> Come on, let's sing Pearl's song together, for old times' sake.<eos> Shut up.<eos> I've told you your whole life to grow a pair, and you just won't listen, and now you're gonna die for it.<eos> Even though I'm the one who's gonna kill you, it's not my fault!
Shut up.<eos> I've told you your whole life to grow a pair, and you just won't listen, and now you're gonna die for it.<eos> Even though I'm the one who's gonna kill you, it's not my fault!<eos> It's not my fault!<eos> I warned you!
If you stay here and fight, you'll die.<eos> But I'm hoping it's not gonna come to that.<eos> We have help coming, and more weapons.<eos> That's the spirit.<eos> Don't let the bastards get you down.
You.<eos> You broke the rules.<eos> You broke the rules how you found out I broke the rules.<eos> Yeah, you broke the rules!<eos> I can break the rules 'cause you guys broke the rules before but I didn't bust you enough.
He's diabetic.<eos> He forgot his insulin today, and if we don't get on that flight, he may die.<eos> Oh, my goodness.<eos> Of course.<eos> I'll get one of our flight attendants to escort you on.
Come on.<eos> What a waste.<eos> Maria.<eos> Leave me alone.<eos> Maria, where is Elishia keeping you all?
Leave me alone.<eos> Maria, where is Elishia keeping you all?<eos> You and her, you want... .. you want to hide the Lord's miracle.<eos> No, I'm trying to help you.<eos> She's the one that's hiding you.
Tam, would you join me in the bathroom to help me with the-the-the-the...<eos> I know what you guys are trying to do, so... the helping me to shit?<eos> Of course.<eos> - My God.<eos> - And, uh, we'll leave you two alone.
Specifically a date?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Because... the dictionary might disagree.<eos> (Groaning) Oh, God, the dictionary...!<eos> Oh, fuck you off.
Why didn't you just tell us who you were?<eos> I figured, under the circumstance, we'd end up here anyway.<eos> Besides, I missed the place.<eos> We also know you're a P.I. licensed to carry.<eos> Told you I could explain the heater.
My interns, gather.<eos> Okay, kids, when I started this day, I had one goal and that was to get a deal.<eos> But then I learned what commission is, and now my goal is money, money, money, bitch.<eos> Now, I'm gonna take lunch, but I need you guys to keep it on, on, on, on, on.<eos> Please don't leave the building so that you work and also I won't be able to sign you back in 'cause I won't be here.
He's my father.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - You all right, Abe?<eos> Listen up, you sorry rebel traitors.<eos> Something about our Mr. Woodhull he may not have told you yet.
Muss sold us out!<eos> Muss is no traitor.<eos> Ibrahim caught him leaving Ma'an half an hour ago.<eos> With his wife.<eos> I swear to God, I didn't sell you out.
The people are getting tired of the raids and the checkpoints.<eos> And they're blaming us.<eos> And look at us!<eos> We're turning on each other.<eos> You can kill me, but whoever betrayed you will still be out there.
Media's swarming the gate.<eos> We're gonna meet your family on the tarmac.<eos> Need a minute?<eos> I just need to see my kids.<eos> He told me to tell you how much he loves you both.
I know of one man powerful enough to turn the tide in our favor.<eos> Vlad.<eos> The Ottomans stole his armor.<eos> 'You get the armor's secrets, and the Crusade gets the man who made it.'<eos> We can forgive Lorenzo as I have forgiven you.
We do not think that anyone still living in Pretty Lake has anything to fear.<eos> In the meantime, the most important thing that needs to be done is to gather all of the bodies and burn them.<eos> Full instructions will be posted on the town's website.<eos> I understand this is an awful and dreadful thing we ask you to do, but once the bodies have been burned, we hope that we will be able to lift the quarantine.<eos> The world is praying with you through your unimaginable loss.
Oh, you're joking.<eos> There's none scenarios that this is possible.<eos> Ladies, I know you're upset, but you know what I do when I'm upset?<eos> I hook up with me.<eos> But I want to assure you that this will not affect my judgment as vice principal.
Working on something new or...<eos> - That's right, yeah.<eos> - I can't wait to read it.<eos> You know, I feel terrible we haven't seen more of you guys this summer.<eos> We've been meaning to have you over.
You know, that's not too long after I talked to those two knuckleheads about that red pickup truck.<eos> You lied, Tina.<eos> You and Scott.<eos> Huh? Wh-What are you talking about?<eos> Last night when CSI Stokes was here, he told you about a red pickup that had been spotted near where Brad was killed.
I'm so sorry.<eos> I'm just so stressed out all the time.<eos> And I'm terrified that I'm gonna fail and let everyone down.<eos> I know.<eos> After everything I put you through last spring.
And like all experiments, it began with a hypothesis.<eos> What was the hypothesis?<eos> And don't anyone say a word about ice cream.<eos> The hypothesis was that a room full of young scientists could come together to solve a problem.<eos> I never told you that you had to work alone, but that's what each of you chose to do.
No, Kymmi.<eos> K-Y-M-M-I, Kymmi.<eos> That is not a name.<eos> I hate you, Kimmy.<eos> Look, I know you came here all the way from Indiana, but I don't want you in my life.
People once thought this a holy book.<eos> They believed it held the answers from a god that would save them.<eos> Boys, there is no god in the Badlands.<eos> How do I know?<eos> A god does not feed you or clothe you or protect you.
How do I know?<eos> A god does not feed you or clothe you or protect you.<eos> I do.<eos> Most of you are orphans.<eos> Your parents died after a life of servitude and left you to pay off their debt.
(Manolis) Wait.<eos> Say this again.<eos> You have to understand, she's in a terrible position.<eos> Terrible.<eos> I've been asked to shepherd you to the dining table for lunch.
You got me.<eos> I was a rat.<eos> What would happen if Katherine hale found out that you're the one who got her husband killed?<eos> I helped you out once before.<eos> Maybe there is a way I can help you out again.
As long as the tower is transmitting, we're good to go.<eos> Everyone will hear what we say.<eos> Well, anyone who's listening.<eos> Once the spike is uploaded, we'll signal.<eos> And I spirit you away in the Phantom.
Let's do this!<eos> Here we go, yeah, here we go!<eos> Come on, yeah, move those arms, move those legs, move those arms.<eos> Let's go, guys.<eos> What ignites you?
To tell David there might be another way!<eos> Ladies...<eos> I brought you some food.<eos> Thought you might need to keep your strength up.<eos> I'd hate for David to think I was mistreating you.
If anybody wants to watch it it's important you know it knocks out half a calendar day.<eos> Look, do you guys remember when we hugged and jumped up and down in the cafeteria?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Obviously.<eos> Well, having been together virtually non-stop ever since, at what point do you think I slipped off with pen and paper and planned an entire grift, then withheld it from you?
You do look awfully tan.<eos> Doesn't she, Julian?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I haven't, uh, looked at her yet.<eos> I don't know what brought you in here today, but if it's about infidelity, I would have to say, as your therapist, to just be cool about it.
I'm done.<eos> Mr. Gross, no other firm could've done anything else.<eos> You know what, Cary, save it.<eos> Your attorney screwed up.<eos> David Lee took advantage of you.
You got to call them and tell them it was just me.<eos> - No!<eos> - Ryan!<eos> It won't make a difference.<eos> Director Franklin already told me to suspend the 3 of you the minute I see you, which I will do when I see you tomorrow morning.
- You tend to these men?<eos> - I do.<eos> What do they suffer from?<eos> Gastric fever, gangrene, crushed limbs that cannot heal.<eos> I would not advice you to approach them.
All right, another toast to the lovebirds. Oh.<eos> May you have as much happiness as we've had and more.<eos> Mazel tov.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I knew, you know, from the very first time I saw the two of you together, I turned to Robert, and I said, "He's going to propose while they're here."
And your grandmother had an affair with Thomas Hodges, and she got pregnant, and when Silas found out that the baby wasn't his, he drowned it.<eos> That's why Hodges torched Silas's land, Cole, revenge.<eos> If this is true, why... why... Why didn't we know about it?<eos> Because your father didn't want you to know.<eos> He... he... he worried it would do to you what it did to him.
- That's what the hole pays.<eos> What it pays John Chinaman.<eos> We got families to feed, Stro.<eos> How can we do that on a dollar a day?<eos> I promise you, I will get you out of that hole as soon as I can.
We thought we'd lost you forever.<eos> Oh, Max.<eos> Thank you all of you.<eos> I want to tell you everything.<eos> Who are these people looking for you?
If any of you talk about us on the telephone or in a message... they will find us.<eos> So what happens next?<eos> Right now, we keep moving.<eos> We find the others.<eos> It doesn't seem that's really been working out for you so far.
I'm a lot younger than you think.<eos> What's this, sympathy?<eos> Don't have to call it anything.<eos> Have you thought about the press?<eos> The publicity would protect you.
The fields are deserted.<eos> - Baron!<eos> - No.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> All right, no one's gonna hurt you.
- Maybe.<eos> Does this mean we get to leave soon?<eos> Quinn wants us to find the Widow.<eos> We leave in an hour.<eos> Quinn and the other barons, they want you to believe they're benevolent because they protect you from the horrors of the world.
- [Laughs] - But unlike these two, we had the good sense to move out.<eos> No, don't include me in that.<eos> I'm ready to go.<eos> And not just the neighborhood, I want out of the city.<eos> So what's preventing you two from moving out?
Me.<eos> I've been following her so I can catch her before she does something stupid a-and just lock her away forever.<eos> Uh, Charlie... That's not an answer.<eos> Sam's right.<eos> We'll go back to Oz, and we'll ... we'll get the key from the wizard of douche, and we'll put you back together.
This is Seth.<eos> They wrote down all my information in this little notebook, and then Seth yanked out a piece of my hair and put it in a bag.<eos> - Mommy!<eos> - Duncan had tissue samples of the Castor original.<eos> My people will get you out of the country.
Bartender, can we get another round of pink ladies?<eos> - It's on us, I promise.<eos> - Ignore them.<eos> How about you faggots enjoy your drinks somewhere else?<eos> Yeah, if you know what's good for you.
I'll try.<eos> So, I'm gonna shower, change my clothes, face Gardner, and we are going to turn this around.<eos> Walter, I'm really worried.<eos> I think this might be the end.<eos> Look, I know I have let you all down.
Ursula, pout all you want, but I expect you home by high tide.<eos> Darling.<eos> Come.<eos> You're missing out on all the fun.<eos> I already told you...
I mean, the story with this drawing in it, from my...<eos> Well, a-a little experimental writing I did for another book that I never got the chance to write.<eos> Where did you get this?<eos> It just turned up one day in Robin's things.<eos> I don't know how that happened, but it... yeah, it suggests that something is looking out for you.
Let's peek in on orientation.<eos> We get the Drainer, a little good press, suddenly every Metro cop out there wants to be Powers Division.<eos> Fucking assholes.<eos> Another day with us and they'll know what an asshole really is.<eos> New guys, allow me to introduce you to the effects of Sway.
I feel a vast reservoir of power.<eos> Sway.<eos> What a wonderful name.<eos> And he shall have sway and dominion over all the world.<eos> Allow me to introduce you to the effects of Sway.
I don't think she wants to leave.<eos> Do you?<eos> You have misconstrued me entirely.<eos> Always.<eos> You thought I was grooming you for some great ascension.
Do you?<eos> You have misconstrued me entirely.<eos> Always.<eos> You thought I was grooming you for some great ascension.<eos> And then, when I lost my composure, you thought I had been fattening you like cattle.
Let's just for science and giggles say exactly like a fetus.<eos> Because like a healthy fetus, it is thriving.<eos> You know, there are even some types of tumors that grow teeth, hair...<eos> A stray eye.<eos> Have I repulsed you?
Good Morning.<eos> First of all, I want to welcome all newcomers to the center.<eos> And to those who aren't new: be careful, I've got my eye on you.<eos> I'll be your tutor, and I'm here to help you, if you let me.<eos> Cos I'm warning you, if you don't make the effort, I'll be your enemy
Right, Macho Man?<eos> Fuckin' drop it, man.<eos> Why the fuck do they call me that?<eos> Maybe if you stopped wearing your big brother's clothes...<eos> Fuck you both!
I love you too.<eos> Aritz, come here.<eos> I love you both, and I'm always gonna love you.<eos> Me too.<eos> I love you both too.
There's no blunt trauma.<eos> Either way, we have a very different scenario.<eos> Why don't you guys head back.<eos> All right.<eos> Well, we'll see you in 20 minutes.
They're going to hang me.<eos> The king will not dare kill his brother's lover.<eos> He will spare you, but not without torturing you first.<eos> But if you talk of our little group, I will neither torture nor spare you.<eos> I will simply cut you open from gullet to groin with a fish knife.
Madame de Clermont, we will first seek to force him out of power.<eos> Our friend and ally William of Orange grows stronger by the day.<eos> He will give us whatever we want by way of money and men.<eos> Go now.<eos> When the time is ripe, each of you will be given a list of people at court susceptible to persuasion.
William of Orange, Your Majesty.<eos> I understand a ship sporting French colours left port a few days ago.<eos> Yes, I believe a cargo of wine and cheese recently arrived on our shores.<eos> Ah, from what I am told, its cargo was never destined for a banquet.<eos> Well, I shall make some enquiries if it bothers you so.
Hurry!<eos> Come on, come on.<eos> Stop!<eos> You're gonna kill each other, is that what you want?<eos> Listen to me-- you have the power to fight whoever turned you into this, both of you do, but not if you kill each other.
You have something against gifts?<eos> It's not a gift.<eos> It's an invitation.<eos> One that I can't accept.<eos> I've told you.
Well, I don't think...<eos> Well, I know exactly what I want.<eos> I want light fixtures hung with strands of jewels, painted tiles in the foyer bearing the Valois and Bourbon crests, intertwined in friendship.<eos> Well... I do know a custom tile maker.<eos> I just don't think my husband is going to approve of me helping you.
Designers send collections to my homes in the hope that my wife will choose one.<eos> I can't wear a dress meant for your wife.<eos> That feels wrong.<eos> Kenna, it's only clothing.<eos> I'm sure you'll find something that suits you.
What the hell kind of a person just barrels into someone and then drives off like that?<eos> Are you ok?<eos> What happened?<eos> Do you need help?<eos> I was out walking, and I heard you two.
Care to say a few words?<eos> Hey, you still ducking the cameras?<eos> Not everyone needs the attention.<eos> Hunter, Porter, need to see you in the bullpen.<eos> This department owes you a debt of gratitude, which is why tomorrow, the mayor is presenting you with medals of honor.
Ms. Waters.<eos> New to town and already someone's plus-one.<eos> Such a warm and embracing community.<eos> Oh, I'm so relieved you're all okay.<eos> I was afraid a pack of wild animals had gotten to you, considering your no-shows last night.
Connie. Hm?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> California.<eos> Yes.<eos> Be sure to read the Dave Hickey essays I gave you for discussion...
It's the book that he wrote for the two of you.<eos> When he was examining our partnership for the Bureau?<eos> Yeah.<eos> But he left out the psychology and the efficacy of your partnerships and all that other boring, technical stuff and turned it into a love story.<eos> By someone who really, really loved you a lot.
You feel bad?<eos> Yeah. So when I absorbed Luke's magic, I must have gotten some of his qualities or something like empathy.<eos> So I googled how to process emotional pain, and they said if you write everything down in a letter and burn it, you'll be healed.<eos> So I started writing, and this water literally started pooling in my eyes.<eos> Has that ever happened to you, like... Like water just... Just oozing out of my eyeballs like I'm some alien creature excreting fluids.
I scribbled some notes on Nova Scotia.<eos> We just have to get her to see it.<eos> All right, but how do we open an atlas if we can't touch anything?<eos> We need to get Kai to crank up his witchy-woo, don't we, so we can make physical contact.<eos> All while sending the 3 of you back over there? Why don't I reanimate your dead parents for a tea party while I'm at it?
I'm a good buddy.<eos> And plus, this way I can keep an eye on you two.<eos> I am kidding, guys.<eos> Jeez.<eos> I told you, I'm over it.
You have ten seconds to disperse.<eos> After that, everyone here will receive Saturday detention for a month.<eos> Is he for real?<eos> I know you all hate these new rules.<eos> A real politician would get up here and tell you they hate them too, but I won't pander, especially when that's not how I feel.
You know anything about that?<eos> No.<eos> What about the dead body that we found locked in one of the barracks buildings this morning?<eos> A dead body?<eos> I told you I didn't see anything up there.
Still, did we really have to drive all the way upstate just for this?<eos> "Just for this," are you kidding?<eos> You've been bitching about never getting the chance to play pro hockey...<eos> Semi-pro.<eos> ...for as long as I've known you.
- Water is safer than the land.<eos> It's harder for them to control the checkpoints, especially at night.<eos> We have a small fishing vessel waiting for you in an hour.<eos> 7:30 sharp, near the warehouse district.<eos> The fisherman will take you down the Seine to the coast,
You see them writhing in agony on the streets, you put them down.<eos> You don't let them suffer. I'm getting security.<eos> Susanna, calm down. Get down.<eos> That's very rude behavior.<eos> None of you seem particularly likeable, but if you do have any friends or anyone who does love you,
Gout.<eos> May I present his children?<eos> The lords Finn, Niklaus, Elijah, and Kol.<eos> Also the lovely lady Rebekah.<eos> Your father never mentioned you to me in all our dealings.
Correct, Lord William, as our troops are not even there.<eos> It's the expense of your Scottish cause, which many say is personal, designed more to undermine Scotland's queen than secure our borders.<eos> There are many reasons to back the Protestants in Scotland.<eos> You back their efforts because they want Mary, their Catholic queen, gone, a queen even English Catholics believe has the right to your throne. What next?<eos> Do we attack half our population to put you at ease?
‚ô™ but when I see you hanging about with anyone ‚ô™<eos> ‚ô™ it's not unusual to see me cry ‚ô™<eos> ‚ô™ I wanna die ‚ô™<eos> ‚ô™ it's not unusual... ‚ô™<eos> Took you long enough.
Fine.<eos> Take him.<eos> Tay, cool?<eos> Yeah, totally cool.<eos> All right, see the rest of you later.
What's this message that's so important?<eos> I'm sorry, Majesty.<eos> There is no message.<eos> All that wine, and the look of you, I just...<eos> Is this your choosing or has someone pressured you?
Well, I'd like to see the body.<eos> So where is the simulation?<eos> A couple of floors below us, and that's easier said than done.<eos> In order to mimic conditions on Mars as well as discourage any cheating, the simulation is filled with noxious gas.<eos> Right, it won't kill you, but it will induce severe nausea and a rash.
He didn't go anywhere near the rover.<eos> And neither did Angela.<eos> And that's what makes this crime so clever.<eos> From the beginning, the three of you have been able to alibi each other out because you were all in on it together.<eos> It would've taken the three of you colluding to convince M.I.R.A. that Tom was threatening the mission.
Otherwise why would he try to expose Vincent by tipping off the police?<eos> Wait, so you think that Liam's trying to expose Vincent as a beast?<eos> It is the worst thing that could happen to us, right?<eos> I really think that Liam's trying to get revenge on us because we wouldn't let him get revenge on the Ellingsworths.<eos> Guess he's not confusing you two for Rebecca and Alistair anymore?
Go ahead.<eos> I think you should all come up to the bridge immediately.<eos> We're receiving a transmission.<eos> From who?<eos> Someone who says he knows you.
Anyway, where were we?<eos> Oh right, you were talking about how you were gonna make it up to me.<eos> Were we?<eos> I didn't think...<eos> Let me bottom line this for you, okay?
This is everyone's war now.<eos> Enos has an entire army waiting to be unleashed.<eos> If we don't find a way to destroy him, then nothing will stop him from taking over Charleston, one soul at a time.<eos> Enos has been going after all three of you.<eos> Ever since that mark first appeared on your back, he's kept the three of you apart.
He knows he can't beat us if we're all together.<eos> What else do you remember?<eos> Some big retreat coming up.<eos> Everybody at AO was talking about it.<eos> That demon that he put inside me, it wanted me to bring you there... to Enos.
That's awful.<eos> But that's how my dad treated his toilet, so that's where I learned it.<eos> It's a shame.<eos> So that's the noise I make when I pee.<eos> And, uh, some of you might be wondering-
- Light and breezy? - Ow! - Light and breezy is how you describe a linen pantsuit, not a relationship you care about.<eos> - We were just being cautious.<eos> - Cautious? - Ow!<eos> - You guys started this with one foot out the door.<eos> That's what doomed you, not the universe.
But don't use it while you're going through a gate, it goes crazy.<eos> - And it might crash some times.<eos> - What do I do then?<eos> You turn it off then on again.<eos> A civil servant will be waiting for you, Carrasco.
Gunshots.<eos> I beg your pardon, "monsieur", but I haven't mastered these modern weapons yet.<eos> I have.<eos> - Lola, Lola.<eos> - That harpy sold you out.
...so now you have to find the Guernica receipt.<eos> It's a Picasso painting, maybe the most important one in all of the 20th century.<eos> Gate 864.<eos> According to our data, the case will arrive to Madrid tomorrow morning. to 1981's Madrid, of course.<eos> The Ministry is lying to you all, Amelia.
You really kept tabs on her, huh?<eos> It's most of what I do here. A-ee. A-ee.<eos> Is Charles having a stroke?<eos> No, he's warning me you're here so I won't talk about other girls.<eos> Just thought it might be weird for you, because of your history.
We all just had our memories wiped clean.<eos> Okay, let's say I believe you, which I don't.<eos> But let's say I do.<eos> What's my next move?<eos> Just send you on your way, let you keep being me?
You even garnered some respect in certain circles.<eos> You can't afford to have people think you've gone soft.<eos> We could send you back to your ship without your tongue.<eos> Maybe that would help.<eos> I'm just telling you what i hea.
And how does that help us?<eos> We bring in our own power.<eos> Juice the door independent of the main system.<eos> It'll bust right open.<eos> If it's so easy, why the hell do we need you slu?
Of course there's the question of whether you were playing both sides.<eos> [THREE sighs] Come on.<eos> [ONE] Everyone knows we've been untouchable since our fallout with Ferrous.<eos> [CALCHEK] Heh. Well, things change.<eos> See, Ferrous Corp. just reached out to me to reach out to you about a job.
Yeah, how'd that work out?<eos> Not particularly well for the program, or for the 43 scientists and security personnel who lost their lives when she made her escape.<eos> We believe that there is a flaw in her neural network that leaves her prone to irrational behavior and outbursts of extreme violence.<eos> Listen, you are very lucky.<eos> It was only a matter of time before she turned on you, too.
Could you speak up, please?<eos> I'm having trouble hearing you.<eos> I said, "Welcome to Hell Week!"<eos> When you stupid dugongs first waltzed through that door, I could tell you thought you were gonna have it easy.<eos> Well, let me relieve you of that misconception, because you're about to get hazed harder than a suburban banquet hall during bat mitzvah season.
But none of you are excused to leave.<eos> So, if you do, you will be graded on every missed test and class assignment.<eos> And this investigation could take weeks, which means it's most likely that you will fail out of college.<eos> Wh... Gigi, you can't let her do this.<eos> If someone is targeting you, they're gonna find you wherever you are.
To be part of a sisterhood and make lifelong friends.<eos> Ew, no, for making me popular enough to get a hot, rich husband.<eos> Guys, both our families are loaded.<eos> I am about to be, like, super rich.<eos> Not if the ghost murders you first.
The Bible, monsignor.<eos> "Pardon your neighbor any wrongs done to you, and your sins will be forgiven".<eos> Monsignor, may I remind you your role is to advise the heathen to confess and heal his soul.<eos> Don't change subject.<eos> And I remind you the life of a man is at stake.
I am not hungry, but a good soldier must feed himself even if he is not hungry.<eos> You should eat something too.<eos> I can't.<eos> Thinking about the rabbi, his wife, the Ministry... and knowing tonight I have to go have dinner and keep putting up with my mother.<eos> I'm jealous of you two, not leading a double life, no one asking about your life, no one waiting for you at home...
The exit is exactly three blocks from the student halls.<eos> Here's a map.<eos> I know where it is.<eos> Very good.<eos> A Ministry agent will be waiting for you there, Ortigosa.
Do you feel sorry for Lola?<eos> Remember the Empecinado?<eos> Or the suspect that escaped from the future to become the magistrate of Salamanca?<eos> Or that because of her, the Nazis almost took control of this Ministry?<eos> Besides, she hasn't treated you well, has she?
Tell me.<eos> I lost my life and my love.<eos> All this is bullshit and you know it.<eos> I only know that you're my superior and that you've betrayed me.<eos> I don't care what punishment the Ministry gives you.
I think I'd rather not know.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Well I plan on going to say goodbye to Federico.<eos> Federico?<eos> Careful, that poet's really grown on you, huh?
It can not be.<eos> You are dead.<eos> I am.<eos> And from this corpse I tell you that not long ago you troubled my Blanca and there is no woman more innocent.<eos> If you do it again, you will have to come with me to your punishment receive, for Satan claims you.
- impersonating you?<eos> - Who would want to take the place of a man condemned to death?<eos> That lady was with me, so you can bugger off.<eos> Who are you to tell me what to do?<eos> - Someone will break you in two if...
I met your mother too.<eos> Her name is Blanca, right?<eos> Why didn't you say something?<eos> Because I'm not a man of memories.<eos> Yes, in fact, I think I've seen you before.
I finally enlisted in the San Esteban.<eos> I trust this saint to protect me.<eos> Me, and all these men.<eos> They're all looking for a love to bid farewell to.<eos> And it looks like your friend hasn't forgotten you.
- Anything.<eos> - You see that man?<eos> Don't ever leave his side.<eos> He must come aboard the San Juan like you, whatever the cost.<eos> If you don't succeed, not even the king will save you from the executioner.
From who do I tell her the gift is?<eos> A friend of the family.<eos> Come on. Take it to her, then you can come back and play.<eos> Come on.<eos> Yes, in fact, I think I've seen you before.
Outside is taken care of. And I will sort this out in a jiffy.<eos> Let's see, do any of them speak Spanish?<eos> - Yes, this one.<eos> Well listen carefully, because this is the last time I'll say it,<eos> I have 100 more men in the hallways, and all your comrades are dead, so surrender and we will treat you with honor.
Let's leave here.<eos> What a waste of cyanide.<eos> Go on, say what you want to say.<eos> If you're saying that because of Lola, do not worry<eos> I do not blame you.
Do we know anything about the American?<eos> Officially, his name is Paul Walcott, Canadian, but well find out if any of it's true.<eos> He passes himself off as a specialist in documents from the interwar period.<eos> His plane arrives at 16:00 from Zurich.<eos> It's important that he doesn't see you, in case he remembers you from Barcelona in 1939.
Two against one.<eos> Are you always so brave?<eos> - Thank God.<eos> - I haven't given you permission to talk.<eos> Who invited you to this party?
Like the stone bulls.<eos> I still have the scar.<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> He was.<eos> But I would be lying if I did not tell you that he taught me how life is.
He must be in the magistrate's dungeons.<eos> If he's lucky they'll put him on a ship... or send him to war. And if he's unlucky?<eos> He'll never get out of the dungeon alive.<eos> (COUGHS)<eos> Who are the men and the woman - who were with you? - I don't know.
He's right.<eos> What lady would spend the night in here?<eos> Er...<eos> I don't know.<eos> But your soft hands give you away.
So be it.<eos> It would be best if you leave immediately.<eos> (Door opening)<eos> I'm surrounded by idiots.<eos> But who has humiliated you in this manner?
- Previously on Reign:<eos> - How did we die, Mother?<eos> She suffocated you.
Do not betray your other children.<eos> I realize I can't change the fact that...<eos> You blame me for what happened.<eos> I believe that we should lead separate lives.<eos> The money I gave you was never going to build a school.
And then I realized what would happen to me if the queen found out.<eos> I saw Claude's little dress in the corner... the one with the flowers torn off... and I knew the answer.<eos> So after my sisters froze to death, you shoved flowers into their mouths and waited for my mother to blame me?<eos> I hoped she would think you were too young to know what you'd done.<eos> I hoped she'd forgive you.
I understand you've had some issues with my rule.<eos> You refuse my offers of lands because, what, you... you don't like the way I handle dissent?<eos> I've questioned a few of your acts of repression, yes.<eos> Do you know where I hear about most of your dissent?<eos> Mary tells you.
We know you attacked Stevie in Cardiff when the band split, and we also know that Stevie potentially costing you the beer commercial money was "Cardiff again".<eos> And now we know you murdered him.<eos> What?<eos> You what?<eos> Grand Central Beer brought you all back together and it pushed you all apart again, didn't it?
Just come stand by me and your brother.<eos> We'll do anything you ask.<eos> Please, just don't... don't hurt my family.<eos> Just take what you want.<eos> No one's stopping you; we're the only ones here.
Let's just for science and giggles say exactly like a fetus.<eos> Because like a healthy fetus, it is thriving.<eos> You know, there are even some types of tumors that grow teeth, hair...<eos> A stray eye.<eos> Have I repulsed you?
Okay. Found you. Oh!
Well, if I were you, I'd put down the burrito and get up that ladder.<eos> What are you doing standing there and not getting drinks for me and my good friend, Claire?<eos> Actually, we just met.<eos> Oh, guys, guys, I can't let you do the cleanup all by yourselves.<eos> Ronaldo will help you.
There is a bully in our life, and it's you.<eos> You make the rules, you boss us around,<eos> - and we're not gonna take it anymore.<eos> - Mm. Yeah.<eos> Ah, look at you two, standing up to the big, scary bully that loves you and protects you and wants you to be safe in this world.
Thank you.<eos> I, uh... have another.<eos> But your bottle is almost empty.<eos> We can't have that.<eos> Why don't you let me help you down, and we'll go reconnoiter the kitchens for some warm mulled wine.
This is clearly the fault of my own servant, and I will deal with her.<eos> You may punish your servant as you wish, but these girls, they belong to me.<eos> You are both banished from my household and will be gone by morning.<eos> Now get out!<eos> Look, I know what he has done to you all.
You are not responsible.<eos> It is God's will.<eos> Will you come and see her?<eos> Don't be afraid.<eos> This is Peter, the man I told you about.
See, I am trying to unite the city against this abomination, and I believe that if we all put our differences aside and stand as one, then we can repel this barbarity.<eos> Well, that is certainly a noble intention.<eos> But, um, we cannot help.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I let you back in.
Prepare yourselves!<eos> Begin!<eos> Don't go.<eos> You have a new life now.<eos> I'll come and find you afterwards.
Excuse me?<eos> Don't talk to her.<eos> You don't belong here.<eos> The two of you don't belong here, not with Gus, not trapped in this place with him.<eos> You don't deserve what's going to happen to you.
Cy says the CIA's confident they'll have her home within 24 hours.<eos> That's good. Whew.<eos> We sleep better when she's lying between us.<eos> I'm not sure how to respond to that.<eos> The truth shall set you free.
Heading to Cole's house in Westchester.<eos> There is no need for lying here.<eos> When Eva found out that Cole was sleeping with your wife, she came to you with a plan.<eos> Yes.<eos> He had betrayed the both of you.
I am told that when you thought the King was dead, your first action was to send for the bastard Mary.<eos> You did not think of me, or my daughter or the child I was carrying then.<eos> I cannot hold the throne for an infant in the cradle.<eos> I cannot hold the throne for an unborn baby.<eos> I promoted you.
Seat yourself, pretty boy. Ah!<eos> I take it back.<eos> I can't give you any names.<eos> I don't know how I came to say what I did.<eos> No, nor do I. No-one hurt you or coerced you.
Is it likely?<eos> Well, I doubt she could resist!<eos> Why spare?<eos> Why not drink the cup to its filthy dregs?<eos> Come, Wolsey, we're fetching you to Hell, where our master, Beelzebub, is expecting you to supper!
Did you not make gifts of money to Francis Weston?<eos> Yes.<eos> Silence!<eos> Silence!<eos> On this page are words the Queen is said to have spoken to you, and which, in turn, you passed on.
My heart beats strong again.<eos> My head is clear.<eos> I see a future beckoning us.<eos> I did not ask to be your general.<eos> I was asked by our government to lead you.
Sir.<eos> _<eos> Easy.<eos> You were born to live as free men.<eos> One man took that freedom from you.
Excuse me.<eos> Blake, you get back here.<eos> You can't do this. - The Wizards--it's our thing.<eos> - Oh, yeah?<eos> Well, Menergy was our thing too, but you kicked me out of that, so I'm kicking you out of The Wizards.
What do you mean, you got paid to go out with me?<eos> - You're pathetic.<eos> - Well, you're a prostitute.<eos> I'm a model!<eos> What is wrong with you two?
And a friend of your mother's.<eos> She...she speak to you today?<eos> Shame.<eos> She said she was going to call, let you know we were coming.<eos> She sent you to get me out of here?
Well, maybe we both saw what we needed to see.<eos> What is all this?<eos> Water purifier?<eos> Freeze-dried hotdogs!<eos> You really believe this stuff's going to save you? Yes, ma'am.
It's one of the few mental health problems I don't suffer with.<eos> It's a shame you're not as cool as the city that you work in.<eos> And that, ladies and gentlemen...<eos> And that, ladies and gentlemen, is how you fuck up a university interview.<eos> But this - pretty much everything I'm about to tell you - was why it didn't matter in the slightest.
I'm glad to hear it.<eos> No offence. MUSIC: The Medication Is Wearing Off by Eels<eos> Performing Arts Theory is two hours long.<eos> It's also, for many of you, your final exam, so good luck.<eos> Time now is two o'clock, which gives you until four o'clock.
Brutal way to die.<eos> Especially as he was innocent.<eos> A ransom befitting a prince.<eos> A bargain.<eos> Considering I warned you that Catherine was circling.
Considering I warned you that Catherine was circling.<eos> And provided you with a scapegoat to shoulder the blame.<eos> And to die for you.<eos> The poisoner Frederic was dead.<eos> What led you to me?
Yes.<eos> I have an excess of expertise in that area.<eos> After all, how does one acquire so much land to lose?<eos> So, you're clever and grasping.<eos> What's to stop you from blackmailing me?
I can't.<eos> Look, you take her out for a drink.<eos> It will be rewarding.<eos> You will thank me, bro.<eos> I will thank you both when you get back to work.
I'm gonna give Jay a call.<eos> Hey, everything all right with you guys?<eos> We're about to get on the move again.<eos> What have you found?<eos> So it looks like the guys who attacked you are linked to this drug-dealing network operating up and down I-95.
It was close.<eos> You guys barely won.<eos> I lost by a hair. You lost because it's your destiny to lose.<eos> [laughter]<eos> What'd I tell you, boys? The batmobile just blew you away, didn't it?
SECNAV wants us to make sure that this was not a hate crime.<eos> The two other soldiers are at the DEA's offices.<eos> Where's the agent who was in charge of them?<eos> That would be Agent Lindley Richards.<eos> She's currently waiting for you at the crime scene.
God, you've a lot of get-up-and-go, haven't you?<eos> Tell me this much - where do the Jews stand on the whole D-I-V-O-R-C-E?<eos> Well, for a start, I think most of us would say it as a single word.<eos> Right.<eos> Well, that puts you one step ahead of Catholicism anyway.
Nothing to worry about, ma'am.<eos> Yeah. It's okay,<eos> Maria.<eos> Just JJ being a problem again.<eos> JJ saw you two out the window, grabbed what he could, and ran out back.
BOTH: That hurt!<eos> That was painful.<eos> Good, I'm glad it was painful.<eos> You deserve it.<eos> I saw you. Y-you're both [burps] all over the damn place.
Holy shit!<eos> You've gone mad, poor girl!<eos> You thought he'd be here?<eos> He was!<eos> Can I give drop you off?
Yeah, well, you see, I thought you just told me Rusty wasn't in the bar that night.<eos> Oh, Tommy, th-th-that's what I meant.<eos> - I was just...<eos> - You gotta keep the story straight, Karl.<eos> I-I-I'm the guy who made the call for you.
All right. You bums have nothing better to do than hang out here all afternoon drinking beer?<eos> Actually, we do, Mr. Big Shot.<eos> We got some very important business to discuss.<eos> Oh, Big Shot, huh?<eos> Yeah, well, somebody filled you in on the good news, huh?
Busy.<eos> Wish this was under better circumstances.<eos> Want to fill us in?<eos> All right. One last thing.<eos> We know that you're all at the top of your class, but any ideas on why I chose you for this rotation?
You're telling me that all those places have something that the so-called<eos> "greatest city in the world" doesn't?<eos> Why don't we just go do our own things?<eos> Excuse me, I couldn't help overhearing your conversation I was eavesdropping on.<eos> I may have something that both of you will like --
So, that's my game table.<eos> It's where we'll play Candy Land tonight.<eos> All part of the evening!<eos> Yeah, I think this evening is over.<eos> This evening doesn't end until midnight, and don't even think about running away, 'cause I'll catch you.
I know his real first name!<eos> It's Dwayne!<eos> I win Hollywood!<eos> Celebrate now, you stuck-up snobs.<eos> But our plucky little school is going to surprise you.
No one's ever told us.<eos> You know what, I actually don't know.<eos> Me neither.<eos> Not a clue.<eos> Girls, I'm afraid I didn't tell any of you for a reason.
Everyone started pooping out kids.<eos> So many brats.<eos> The doorbell would not... stop... ringing.<eos> We just want to hide out and smoke out and not deal with a zillion randos.<eos> I hope this suits you.
He tastes good.<eos> You killed the homeless man?<eos> It's all over the news.<eos> You can't keep doing this.<eos> The police are gonna find you.
Not yet, no.<eos> But I'll know the tart when I see her.<eos> - Too risky.<eos> - Gut him now.<eos> The surgeons will do you out of business, but I know others who want what I want.
Never!<eos> Never!<eos> Never!<eos> I'll take your arm off with it if I have to!<eos> Maybe I did rehabilitate you kids after all.
Get it?<eos> Nuts?<eos> Is this thing on?<eos> I don't have any feelings, and even I'm uncomfortable watching this.<eos> John 8:32. "The truth will set you free."
Thanks to crowdfunding, we have Makey Makey computers, the 3Doodler pen, and Zach Braff's generation-defining dud<eos> "Wish I Was Here."<eos> Well, if there's anything that has true wisdom, it's crowds.<eos> Hello, friends.<eos> Are you sick of "Big Charity" asking you for money, with its free return envelopes and annoying black tie dinners?
You expect us to believe you don't know who your partners are?<eos> They weren't my "partners."<eos> I was their prisoner.<eos> That's right.<eos> I already told you.
Where I live and work sometimes.<eos> When I'm not with the nuns.<eos> You cleaned my wound.<eos> Stitched it myself.<eos> You're lucky that blade stuck you where it did.
A few inches difference...<eos> Well, even my gift has its limits.<eos> Was it your gift... or your medicine that healed me?<eos> I saved your life.<eos> Does it matter that much to you how?
- Yes.<eos> Your Majesty.<eos> I don't mean to interrupt, but I was told you wanted to see me.<eos> Let's not waste time by pretending you don't know what's happening.<eos> As surely Catherine has told you, I need an army.
- Everybody in?<eos> - It's man log.<eos> You didn't know where it was, did you, Flip?<eos> I thought I did, and...<eos> It wasn't a wind up, honest, Harv, and... I wanted to take you to your rave and... I feel like I've let you all down.
- Fucking hell, boys and girls.<eos> We're fucking here!<eos> FUCK YES!<eos> - Beautiful, man!<eos> - I told you I'd take you there!
She got brainwashed, Kel, he was a fucking vile, vile man, he was a rapist.<eos> He abused me for years, Kelly.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> For years, and you know what?<eos> Right, let me put it like this... .. I don't know if any of you know but Combo is coming out... .. and if he wasn't, I would never breathe a word of this, I would happily take it to my grave and I wouldn't put you through it, any of ya.
What an easy fucking cop-out cos he's in the fucking ground.<eos> It's not a cop-out, it's not a cop-out.<eos> Kelly, we're not going to cop out with that.<eos> Trev, why would she lie about that?<eos> Why would I-why would I be putting any of you through this?
- So you were so fucking special, was ya?<eos> - Please, Kel, stop it, Kelly!<eos> You were special, was ya?<eos> - You two were the special ones? - Stop it!<eos> How come he picked you two, then, eh?
No, I know, I know, it's er...<eos> Yeah, we should've come, really, but, you know, it's just not seemed right, really, without Rob, so...<eos> - But, anyway, it's good to be here now.<eos> - Yeah. I wanted him to see where his dad's from, you know, and see you all again.<eos> Last time he saw you, he was only a little one, weren't he?
You do realize they're just teenagers, right?<eos> With a car full of explosives.<eos> I'm just saying, give Sam time to do his job.<eos> Detective Deeks, if that truck reaches our driveway, I'm doing what needs to be done.<eos> The man who put you up to this-- this is for his own personal vendetta.
Can I tell him anything?<eos> Tell him he's still alive, for now.<eos> Notify O.R. 6 we're on our way up with an emergency ex-lap.<eos> Right away. Whoa! Awesome!<eos> What did I tell you?
- What is it? - Ah. Oh...<eos> No!<eos> Does she know about us?<eos> Yes.<eos> And, you know... she's always wanted me to tell you about her. Erm... How involved in... in her life were you?
- Night, then.<eos> That went well (! )<eos> Class (! )<eos> You have absolutely no proof my client was connected to these events in any way.<eos> And if either of you have kids, I don't need to tell you just how many reasons there could be for Josh saying what he did without any connection to the truth whatsoever.
That's true.<eos> Lukas.<eos> If you kill him, you'll never get your money.<eos> or we can find another solution.<eos> One that both of you benefit from.
And my son?<eos> If he gets a hold of me, will he let my son go?<eos> - Probably not.<eos> - But it's possible?<eos> Experience shows that in these situations the killer would probably kill you both.
What are you doing?<eos> Dialing 911.<eos> I'm calling an ambulance because, in America, we don't let our friends just bleed out on some conference room table.<eos> If Jake goes to a hospital, a digital trail is created from an MRI, billing, a chart, or even just a security camera, and then my father will find out Jake is alive.<eos> My father will track him and find him and kill him, and then he will kill all of you just to teach me a lesson!
Damascus Bainbridge?<eos> Am I not allowed a sense of humor?<eos> I didn't think it was funny.<eos> You're never funny.<eos> Cyrus, don't bite the hand that helps you.
What, you mean the rest of the universe?<eos> Basically, yes, I do.<eos> But they're kind and brave, and strong, and I love them.<eos> Good, good,<eos> - but that won't save you.
So, the question you need to ask yourself is this -- just how important is your reputation to you?<eos> Here's a little sneak preview, piped straight into your helmets, free of charge.<eos> Wait!<eos> Cowards!<eos> If you don't leave right now, I'll put it out there for all to see and no-one will fear you again.
Get out!<eos> It's not a bloody farm yard!<eos> Go on, get out!<eos> Get out!<eos> Who put you up to it?
Hey, Dan, you know what?<eos> We don't have to do this.<eos> I'll leave you guys alone.<eos> You can watch the game by yourselves.<eos> I'll have somebody take you down to the box.
What spurs you to send for us so urgent, Justice Pike?
If it is no imposition?<eos> Very well.<eos> This is our cobbler, Richard Two-Shoes.<eos> He will serve to guard the old woman during our trial.<eos> God bless you, gentlemen.
Aah! - More pain meds!<eos> Fentanyl 150 I.V.<eos> And we need to pack him.<eos> Cellulose polymer. Gauze!<eos> And as you can see, Dr. Kepner is doing the groin tourniquet method as I was telling you about, and Dr. Edwards is attending to the severed... appendage.
Because even if it doesn't work, even if all goes to hell, even if I'm miserable and alone, the smallest chance at the perfect life with you is infinitely better than an immortal one without you,<eos> and I know this, Elena.<eos> I love you... And I will love you until I take my last breath on this earth. Where the hell are you?<eos> Bonnie and Matt are already M.I.A., and now you and Damon?<eos> What is wrong with you?
Sorry to be indecorous, but you were both solidly unconscious when I pulled you from the wedding mayhem.<eos> Where are we going?<eos> Elena!<eos> Elena is in the hospital with Damon.<eos> Kai is dead, and all the Geminis are going down with him, and I grabbed the two of you to help me deal with a bigger problem.
A... a bride?<eos> - To marry?<eos> - Her father only recently contacted me wishing to arrange a marriage contract, but I insisted on an introduction first.<eos> Of course.<eos> You want to make sure this bride suits you.
If so, you have to invite me.<eos> I'm only teasing.<eos> But I am desperately curious about your upcoming nuptials.<eos> I command you to give me details.<eos> You can command me to escort you to every dress shop in town, or to stand by your door until I collapse.
At least visit the castle, and see if it's a place where you could be happy.<eos> I know I would be, if I could... look at your face every day.<eos> Looking for me?<eos> That was a warning shot.<eos> The next will hit you between the eyes.
We are linked.<eos> My spirit is inside you now, as yours is in mine.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> They're burning me.<eos> For the charges of murder, ritual sacrifice, transformation and devil worship, I condemn you, witch, to death by fire. Aah!
Whatever you need, I'm the only one that can get it.<eos> I'm here now.<eos> No blind spots.<eos> You better deliver.<eos> Look, nothing you do to me will make me help you.
You know you can stay as long as you want.<eos> Careful what you offer.<eos> I just might take you up on it.<eos> Oh, I'm counting on it.<eos> I still can't believe I have you both out here.
And how long do we have to put on this show?<eos> Well, this is gonna last until we find Vernon Turner.<eos> I mean, if we can convince him not to testify...<eos> And yes, I know, it's a little illegal, but it's for the greater cause...<eos> The I guarantee you, this case getsismissed.
Are we done?<eos> You in a hurry?<eos> Yeah, I gotta go pick up my son from my sister's house.<eos> If you don't mind taking one more look at the picture.<eos> I already told you, I've never seen him before.

~ No respect.<eos> Fine, Bird, I'll say it.<eos> I don't respect Nick Medhurst.<eos> Why?<eos> Because he didn't respect you.
I don't respect Nick Medhurst.<eos> Why?<eos> Because he didn't respect you.<eos> Any of you.<eos> Because he didn't push you.
I like her talking posh.<eos> It's not posh, Mother, it's proper!<eos> Oh, heh! We're not "proper", Mum!<eos> I wanted BOTH my girls to talk nice!<eos> That's why I sent you for electrocution lessons.
Oh, come on.<eos> Be honest with yourselves.<eos> The way you two look at each other? Whoo-hoo-hoo!<eos> I can see it.<eos> The levels have opened you up.
- Anyhow, the way I see it is, this is a draft.<eos> Let's have fun.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> - So much fun.<eos> - All right, guys, see you inside.
Please, guys, be careful, OK?<eos> That is not a guy you insult.<eos> His family are very influential, with many friends.<eos> Including myself.<eos> There's something else I need to warn you of.
That was crap, mate.<eos> Three out of ten.<eos> Right, let's drink.<eos> Get her out here and party.<eos> Just don't say I didn't warn you, OK? Tukua te vaeru kia rer ki tona anoano. Allow one's spirit to fulfil its potential.
That's Maui's father, Anaru, and that's his wife Paeta next to him.<eos> We greet and welcome new sinners... ..rejoicing in their desire to find love and forgiveness in Our Saviour, Jesus Christ.<eos> Praise him.<eos> Amen.<eos> Let his light cleanse you, absolve you of your wickedness, so that the redemption you have sought for so long may at last be found.
"Mass graves."<eos> "Sightless children..." ".. clutching toys as they sleep, never to wake up.<eos> "My children.<eos> "My screams.<eos> "I could not save you... little ones.
And now it's time for everyone to prepare for a bacchanalian celebration worthy of eternal damnation.<eos> - Quite the showman.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You will find costumes for this evening's masquerade ball waiting for you in your guest rooms.<eos> Dante will see you all in Hell this evening.
To Versailles!<eos> Good idea.<eos> The Ducd'Orl√©ans will have your head for this.<eos> I can assure you of that.<eos> And when your neck is on the block, do you know what he will say to you?
Should Philippe lose his wife, then a power shift might emerge from her death.<eos> How could that be?<eos> Henriette's very existence strengthens your position.<eos> It keeps your brother's power in check and offers a direct connection to England.<eos> It unfortunately follows that her absence would weaken you in every possible way.
Two coffees, please.<eos> I could say the same to you.<eos> What choice do you think I had?<eos> I had a family to support.<eos> How do you think I kept all of you safe?
I'm speaking to you today as a wife, a mother, a servant of the people, and as your Queen.<eos> Following this address you will hear the palace bells ring five times.<eos> For centuries it was a distress call warning the people that their kingdom was under attack.<eos> And today, we are once again under attack.<eos> Yesterday your King spoke to you from the heart.
Above each of you are two live wires I've connected to the power grid of this facility.<eos> Each has enough volts of electricity to destroy even your powerful bodies.<eos> That metal pipe between you controls whether or not the live wires descend or stay in place.<eos> And to stop from being killed, each of you will have to take turns grasping it.<eos> The pipe delivers an electrical charge that will wear you down.
What?<eos> I was home.<eos> Yeah, just now, where were you?<eos> Thinking how relieved I was that you guys are legit NCIS.<eos> I thought Espada De Satan√°s had sent you.
What happened to you?<eos> He just played games with us.<eos> Who do you love more, me or her?<eos> Who deserves water today?<eos> We all want the person who did that to you punished.
Okay, can you please send that to voicemail?<eos> No, it's a face chat request.<eos> Wait.<eos> If that's Sara, who's sending this?<eos> Yes, I will see you at your session on Tuesday.
My dad's gonna be home soon.<eos> You should probably go.<eos> Maybe we shouldn't leave you alone right now.<eos> No, it'll be okay.<eos> I'll find out what all this means and then I'll call you.
The police patrols will be coming back for protection.<eos> But I-I don't want you going anywhere without me knowing where you are.<eos> I think I'm gonna try to sleep on my own tonight.<eos> Apparently, when they questioned Andrew 'he said a few things about you and the other girls.'<eos> How you all tricked him into helping you.
All right.<eos> Fresh off the boat?<eos> Clean hands.<eos> No labor vos liberabit for you.<eos> "Work will set you free"?
But she hates me.<eos> And she would kill me if she knew I told you.<eos> Like her or hate her, Sadie's been a great friend to me, and she's always had my back, and I don't want to walk without her.<eos> Okay, seniors, this is not a drill.<eos> This is the real deal, so I'm asking you to behave with the dignity and respect that this sacred rite deserves.
Looks like we're finally going in.<eos> Uh, how soon?<eos> We're up next.<eos> Great.<eos> Catch up with you in a second.
Okay then... I am here today to express my solidarity and support, but also to give you some heartfelt advice.<eos> Student collectives are fine, so are meetings, and joint reports, but they are sometimes not enough.<eos> Because there are people who just won't listen.<eos> If you think someone's interested in you for what you are, and what you have inside, you're wrong.<eos> No one's listening to you, they don't care.
Hey, crazy girl!<eos> - Get away from me!<eos> - Hey, nutcase!<eos> Go away!<eos> If you touch me, my father the King will put you in prison!
She's packing right now.<eos> What?<eos> Well, if Koringo is the one that kills her, maybe this is why?<eos> You stealing his fiancee.<eos> What if he finds you on that boat and dumps you both in the water?
This has to be her choice.<eos> Don't listen to them.<eos> They don't understand what's at stake.<eos> You don't understand what's at stake.<eos> If I don't find Merlin, the darkness will destroy all of you.
Yeah, well, demand's really high right now, so, you know...<eos> God damn it, woman, do you even got the word "listen" in your vocabulary?<eos> We'll give you an extra point.<eos> I know you might not be able to do the math... that's pretty damn good.<eos> Extra point puts you in the driver's seat.
You okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm Kess.<eos> Oh, man. Oh.<eos> So, what brings you to Patchwork?
-Yes.<eos> -Could you be more specific?<eos> -No details were mentioned.<eos> Didn't they say, "Winning the tender requires compensation on your part"? Or in similar terms?<eos> No, it was much more subtle in the sense of "help with the campaign, we're helping you with this." That was more the tone.
Then why was he following you?<eos> Maybe he was following you.<eos> He wasn't following me.<eos> He was following you.<eos> I know, because I was following both of you.
Prophecies, they never tell you anything useful, do they?<eos> This is no time to play the fool.<eos> It's the end of the universe.<eos> It's the only time I've got.<eos> - And you want me to keep you all safe. - Can you?
Ah. I'm Bob Babcock.<eos> - It's a pleasure.<eos> - I'm not shaking that hand.<eos> No, no, this is my clean one.<eos> I cannot believe that you and Jimmy spent the last couple of months begging me to take you seriously.
We need to fortify our resources.<eos> Steeper taxes and tariffs.<eos> Yes, agreed.<eos> Pardon, Lord Ventris, good Chamberlain.<eos> Baron Pryce's emissary waits for you at the market.
Kill them all.<eos> Burn it to the ground.<eos> You devils!<eos> You curs!<eos> They will hunt you down and cut out your stone hearts!
The only thing that I ask in return is that you give heartfelt consideration to Baron Pryce.<eos> That my lady stays open to the prospect of a marriage that will protect our shire.<eos> I will stay open to all... prospects.<eos> Thank you, Baroness.<eos> Despite your aggressive, secretive and often illicit tactics, I am quite fond of you, Milus.
I will stay open to all... prospects.<eos> Thank you, Baroness.<eos> Despite your aggressive, secretive and often illicit tactics, I am quite fond of you, Milus.<eos> I believe you left out "godless."<eos> I'm fond of you as well, dear Love.
All are safe.<eos> Father.<eos> My lady.<eos> I am so relieved.<eos> And I am deeply sorry this peril came to you.
Few spend time here but me.<eos> Do you mind?<eos> Please.<eos> I wouldn't think one of your trade would complicate things with prayer.<eos> Perhaps it takes you in deeper.
May I ask how this happened?<eos> It was given to me by a healer.<eos> A holy woman.<eos> A reminder of my need for faith.<eos> Your soldier gave the impression it distinguished you for some time.
Why else would he be here?<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm a Nazi... then why do I bring this?<eos> Film's good.<eos> If you make it back to town, the Marshal will kill you.
Yea.<eos> Take the catch to the village.<eos> I'm sorry, Mother.<eos> That noble waif is the only thing stopping me from gutting you like a cod.<eos> Baroness, what brings you to our simple village?
But I only became certain of my good fortune while on the trail to Windsor.<eos> And of course, as the earl has said, I could not declare the joyous news until His Majesty has his proof.<eos> The happiness I feel for your news, heals any wounding of my pride, Baroness.<eos> I understand the testing by this piss prophet can be quite a... disquieting thing.<eos> Allow me to be of help in any way that best serves you.
Yes, my lady.<eos> I will see that the letters are drafted in haste, so I may release them.<eos> Thank you.<eos> A punisher who concerns himself with the welfare of those he punishes.<eos> It is no wonder I often find you in troubled thought.
They've taken to a full gallop.<eos> Yet you seem of better spirit.<eos> I am.<eos> When you see your healer again, will you share my gratitude for her kindness?<eos> Her remedy served you, then?
She left but yesterday.<eos> Then why did you not dispatch a messenger?<eos> Simple arithmetic,<eos> Sir Dyer.<eos> A messenger sent yesterday would have met you beyond the midway of our shires.
How soon can you be... presentable?<eos> We have had a very long journey.<eos> - Perhaps some time to refresh.<eos> - Of course.<eos> Servants will show you to your quarters.
I mean no disrespect.<eos> Sometimes my love of a brighter future clouds my reason.<eos> I am, I confess, a bit of a dreamer.<eos> In this dream, I presume you would be my chamberlain.<eos> I believe that would serve you best.
See me?<eos> Now, at this hour?<eos> His favorite time of day.<eos> He is in the hunting garden.<eos> Servants will show you when you are dressed.
uh, with my chancellor.<eos> Of course, sire.<eos> We will make the soundest decision.<eos> Perfect.<eos> Allow me to walk you back, Baroness.
Ja.<eos> I will ready my service.<eos> _<eos> I thank you for taking this risk.<eos> I am sorry the slaying of this... eager dog now forces you to flee, but... perhaps it is God taking the reins, guiding you to holler ground.
And why is that our concern?<eos> It is more the concern of your wife.<eos> She told me that some of the knights made vile and lustful advances towards her.<eos> And you, overcome with jealous rage, threatened to take vengeance.<eos> She begs that I confine you until your proper mind can be restored.
I'm sorry.<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> Honey.<eos> I'm the one who's sorry.<eos> I let you all down.
You're the first experiment of your kind in Bureau history.<eos> Please don't screw it up.<eos> Stay away from Simon.<eos> And all of the other NATs.<eos> The assignment waiting for you at the end of your training cannot happen if your cover is blown.
You have to question everything.<eos> You have to look past what you're told to find the truth.<eos> Evidence lies.<eos> Information can be spun.<eos> Your intellect may have got you here, but it will be your instincts that will make you special agents.
Over the next 20 weeks, you will learn to see what people aren't seeing...<eos> You never wear makeup.<eos> We have to match, right?<eos> ...not just to the world but to themselves.<eos> Take a good look at the people around you. ‚ô™ Gotta go deal with dada for nada ‚ô™ Do you trust them?
He had been taunting me for years, and we caught him.<eos> I caught him.<eos> Yeah, well, then, maybe you did it.<eos> I read your book.<eos> So I know that he called you that night.
Because today begins the next phase of your training, and that means thinking bigger, specifically about the world outside of Quantico.<eos> From now on, you'll be able to leave the campus on nights and weekends.<eos> But it also means thinking about the field you're going to be assigned to when you leave.<eos> Once you're out, you're gonna be building cases on your own before you reach out to your superiors.<eos> We've been teaming you up, and now we're going to see how you fare solo.

Well, she sent me an E-mail telling me it was a glitch in the system.<eos> You can search through it and read it for yourself. Huh.<eos> I just thought, after 20 years in the FBI, you didn't believe in coincidences?<eos> Yeah, I'll call Goodwin now.<eos> - ‚ô™ I've never been in love before ‚ô™ - Remember, you're on the lookout for one of 10 possible suspects we showed you
Charlie...<eos> Are you sure about this?<eos> I'm positive.<eos> I hope you know what you're doing.<eos> And the reason that we accepted all of you...
...is because we knew you would.<eos> Stay where you are!<eos> It's Parrish!<eos> There's another bomb hidden somewhere in New York City.<eos> I can't tell you where it is, but if you don't find it fast, it's all over.
We didn't have personal space.<eos> I gave Danny his bath until he was 18.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - We all did.<eos> What is wrong with you people?
Look, I can't believe I'm saying this, but... I need you all to come to our engagement party tonight.<eos> - Tonight?<eos> - Are you serious?<eos> Guys, we're not kidding.<eos> Danny needs you there.
Descendants of the very soldiers who whipped, tortured and lay a crown of locust thorns on the head of the one they mocked as King of the Jews.<eos> The Rosula believe Jesus rose from the dead, walked out of his tomb, and when faced with these same soldiers, he pardoned their sins, and appointed them keepers of his sacred history, granting them divine impunity, and the power of the Church to destroy<eos> anything or anyone that might prove a threat to that story.<eos> The danger that is found in these pages...<eos> What will Robinus and his knights do if they capture you?
Yea.<eos> You were sorely missed, Father.<eos> An unexpected journey to a friend we both know.<eos> Annora.<eos> What turn of fate took you to the healer?
A confession of this candor...<eos> I do not know how...<eos> Give it to Baron Pryce's Chancellor.<eos> He will take proper action.<eos> Allow me but a brief time after I leave you for some final tasks and devotion.
I do not regret loving someone above my status.<eos> Even if this is the fate.<eos> Where is the boy?<eos> By the hearth, unharmed.<eos> Did your master tell you what I did in the service of the king's army?
This will settle many of our accounts and put us on much firmer ground.<eos> Thank you, Milus.<eos> I'm in your debt.<eos> It is my duty and my honor to serve you, Lady Love.<eos> May I ask what troubles you, my lady?
No way.<eos> Suit yourself.<eos> - And if we do help you?<eos> - Then it's simple.<eos> You wash my back, and I fly yours the hell out of the country one step ahead of whoever it is that's chasing you.
I mean, signing up to be mayor of this town is like asking to be part of "the Titanic."<eos> Well, you heard me try to talk her out of running.<eos> I'm pretty sure that got covered up by telling her we'd be at her big announcement.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you all so much.
All right, we split up. Earl, you're with me.<eos> The rest of you, do what you got to do.<eos> But you make no mistake.<eos> Any of you think you're gonna go bag that buck yourself and go running off with the bounty trust me, cuz as sure as we can find him, we will find you.<eos> And we will cut you open and feed your insides to the dogs.
I want to share with you my feeling of Christmas, which is magical.<eos> It smells good, it is beautiful, mysterious...<eos> -Can you please go?<eos> -Sorry.<eos> I know she was calling you on Christmas Eve.
Not fast enough!<eos> Kang, you're too slow.<eos> Pick it up!<eos> You can't go below 40km/h!<eos> After the turn, a gust will hit you from the left.
But you don't have a date with Layla, Marcus.<eos> You have a date with me. See?<eos> Oh, don't worry.<eos> Layla's real, and from her e-mails, I think she really likes you.<eos> She just didn't text you to meet up tonight.
That's hilarious.<eos> Now, gentlemen...<eos> We all know why I asked you here.<eos> I made a mistake... Betrayed the people's trust... And, in doing so, created a situation where you can either support me and risk looking like fools or throw me under the bus and help the democrats hang me.<eos> But as it's me who put you in this position, I'm willing to offer some things in exchange for your mercy.
You know, for the camera.<eos> Look, "Scavenger Hunt" is edited so that we come off as the villains.<eos> But my wife, she was totally sweet an... and endearing.<eos> And accused you of an affair as you drove her off a cliff.<eos> I already told you...
Are you crying for him?<eos> I don't...<eos> I think you are.<eos> You're not crying for my grandmother.<eos> I saw you together.
Yeah?<eos> How the hell are we gonna give a tree a taco?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Didn't anyone ever teach you not to mess with a dwarf and his pickaxe?<eos> Didn't anyone ever teach you to kneel before a King?
Didn't anyone ever teach you not to mess with a dwarf and his pickaxe?<eos> Didn't anyone ever teach you to kneel before a King?<eos> Now, tell me... where am I and how the hell did I get here?<eos> A curse?<eos> That brought you to our realm and wiped the last six weeks from your memory.
No one knows you're there.<eos> How?<eos> Hang glider?<eos> Oh, giant slingshot.<eos> If sir-castic would let me speak, I'd tell you that I wasn't idle during those days in there, playing mute handmaiden at Regina's side.
Well, I mean, I... what I...<eos> I meant that in a good way.<eos> Bob. Yeah.<eos> Wait.<eos> I get it. It was random fate that brought you together.
I can feel the curse in your blood.<eos> Something's restraining it, but you could transition at any moment.<eos> Where the hell is that bastard?<eos> Versailles witches, this is an unbearable tragedy.<eos> In the wake of such sorrow, please allow me to bring you under the protection of the ancestors.
Versailles witches, this is an unbearable tragedy.<eos> In the wake of such sorrow, please allow me to bring you under the protection of the ancestors.<eos> Whoever did this was strong and, for all we know, might return.<eos> If you follow my rules, I promise to keep you safe.<eos> Nothing like this will ever happen to you.
Because the two of you are the fucking worst!<eos> You both hate yourselves and each other.<eos> And the idea that it has anything to do with Rick is laughable.<eos> I'd laugh, but I'm biologically incapable. That's how alien I am.<eos> And even I'm sitting here listening to the two of you and being like, "What the fuck"! So good luck with your shitty marriage, and tell Rick I'm sorry he has to deal with either of you.
-Um, what?<eos> No, I'm sick of this.<eos> You bang on my door, you beg me to help you, I share something personal with you, and you take a giant shit on it.<eos> Hey, man, we asked if we could put up a beacon -- well, you can't.<eos> I want you out of here.
'S "feels good" plays ] Wait, w-where is that music coming from?<eos> What is the meaning of this? ‚ô™ it feels good here's the deal.<eos> I'm not here to judge.<eos> I'm just a guy from another planet.<eos> But this girl is one of your poor people, and I guess you guys felt like it was okay to subject her to inhuman conditions because there was no chance of it ever hurting you.
We love Rick... F-for the most part.<eos> Yeah, you don't love people in hopes of a reward, dad, you love them unconditionally.<eos> That's very good, kids. I'm proud of you.<eos> Okay, so let me get this straight.<eos> For the rest of your lives, no matter how much it hurts you, no matter how much it destroys our children's futures, we're gonna do whatever Rick wants, whenever he wants?
It was no easy task to avoid him, and yet we survived, and when the compulsion ended, it was as if someone had peeled off our skin.<eos> We lost everything of who we were and what we'd become in a single moment, and even though we now knew we were little more than an elaborate red herring,<eos> Mikael was still after us, so Tristan swore he wouldn't rest until we made you pay.<eos> So the 3 of us swore a pact of vengeance.<eos> For centuries, we scoured the world looking for weapons that would kill the lot of you, but Lucien and Tristan never quite got over their hatred of one another.
A place called The Bamboo Palace.<eos> Can you get the money by then?<eos> I'll get it.<eos> Wait.<eos> The Yakuza would sooner kill you than hand over that film. You realize that?
All prisoners are to be relieved of their personal effects.<eos> Do prisoners have the right to know how long they're forced to suffer the sight of these four vile walls and your smug, weaselly face?<eos> I want to see my son.<eos> I am the king of France's mother.<eos> And he is the one who put you here.
Their whispers are treason.<eos> You'll stay in England where you belong, even if I have to take out every last one of them.<eos> Donatella has taken full responsibility for Catherine de Medici's presence at court.<eos> I'm afraid that will no longer suffice.<eos> The council has several nobles claiming to have seen you with the French queen mother during her time at the castle.
The council has several nobles claiming to have seen you with the French queen mother during her time at the castle.<eos> "Several nobles"?<eos> Give me their names.<eos> Who knows if they even exist?<eos> The high lords have challenged you to clean up your mess.
Elizabeth, the issue is larger than this moment.<eos> You've never accepted the fact that your life changed the moment you become queen.<eos> These mistakes...<eos> Catherine de Medici,<eos> Dudley... the people around you, the ones who care, we will pay the price!
Can't you see Silky is singing?<eos> Why don't you scurry on back to "The Golden Girls" convention?<eos> I don't know them!<eos> I thank you all so much!<eos> What is wrong with you people?
You went away.<eos> I cried.<eos> I grew up.<eos> You being here doesn't change any of that.<eos> If I had to do it all over again, I'd have left you in that damn prison world so that I didn't have to see your face again.
And what's wrong with fairy tales?<eos> Please.<eos> There's no such thing as happily ever after.<eos> Mary, just because your mom and you haven't met the right Prince Charming, doesn't mean he isn't out there.<eos> He just hasn't found you yet.
Hard to know what's inside somebody.<eos> I can't believe this is happening.<eos> Betty, how long have you worked with Mr. Childs?<eos> 17 years.<eos> Mr. Wemlinger said he called you just after it happened.
You and Aunt Malika have been so kind.<eos> I didn't want to put you in any more danger than I already have.<eos> I thought...<eos> I'll find a policeman.<eos> Leave you out of it.
I'm a friend of Dmitry's.<eos> My name's Terrence.<eos> He never mentioned you.<eos> I'm based in London.<eos> He's asked me to help get you there safely.
What's really strange is that one would have a child Who grew up to be a serial killer, The other would have a child that grew up to be an fbi profiler<eos> And that the two of you would meet someday. Yeah. So, what's the take-away?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe the events in our lives Were set in motion a long time ago.<eos> There's an old buddhist saying that, When you meet your soulmate, Remember that the act to bring you together
- people in the eye when you cheers them.<eos> - Yes, ma'am.<eos> To a great four days together.<eos> Yes.<eos> Outside of your own family, what woman has had the greatest influence on you?
Well, let's get on with it, then.<eos> I'll go get him.<eos> Wait here.<eos> If you're receiving this message, then things are worse than I feared.<eos> There is only one person who can help you defeat the Dark One now.
- So...<eos> - You got to be kidding me.<eos> We were sent here to help these losers?<eos> - Sent?<eos> - Wait. Who sent you?
Runs fine.<eos> Good news.<eos> You know Dee a long time.<eos> Sure.<eos> Just about as long as I've known you.
Thank you.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Major Gibson.<eos> It's the FBI.<eos> Who sent you?
It's the FBI.<eos> Who sent you?<eos> It's kind of a long story.<eos> Mind if we come in?<eos> Hey, I don't know what they told you, but I'm not talking.
We had a guy from Riverside, Iowa show up, thought he was a starship captain.<eos> Are we supposed to understand what the hell you're talking about?<eos> You've been drawn here by inexplicable visions of leaving the planet on a chariot of fire, right?<eos> We were drawn here by inexplicable visions of finding food and gas.<eos> You didn't have a dream of a large elongated human form with almond eyes telepathically urging you to come to Roswell at this appointed time?
We did see some really strange lights in the sky last night though.<eos> Everything's strange to you.<eos> You grew up in a cave.<eos> Well the important thing is that you're not too late.<eos> Let me show you around before Bernadette returns.
You're drinking it.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> We filter and boil everything.<eos> This is my masterpiece.<eos> Let me show you where we keep the food under lock and key.
Oh, my God, I want to try it.<eos> This whole stadium just for us?<eos> My father bought into the team years ago.<eos> It was a nice investment.<eos> Okay, if you bitches kick it anywhere near my face, I will destroy you through social media.
My name is Ashley.<eos> Or, as I'm better known, Crying Bear.<eos> Some of you are here for personal reasons.<eos> Lost love, or to mourn your murdered femininity.<eos> Some of you I know from my Drumming Away Racism group.
He did, however, wire money from an account in Sarasota to locations that match the movements of Morpheus.<eos> Every week like clockwork, up till 3 weeks ago.<eos> Maybe the association ended.<eos> At the same time the killing began.<eos> I'm sending all this to you right now.
And whenever you're ready, there and there.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, girls.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Not a good time, not a good time.<eos> Wasn't daddy supposed to be driving you to our game?
You screwed up in June.<eos> How'll you pass in September after wasting the summer?<eos> I'll pass to piss you off.<eos> Don't count on us to fund you.<eos> I never asked you to!
The person that printed that money-- who, by the way, is dead-- was trying to use it to bankroll a drug operation, which is why we need to know how it ended up with you.<eos> You don't think we believe you had all that money on you from selling that crazy beatnik hand cream, do you?<eos> Okay, look, we found the money in the Makua Forest.<eos> We can... show you where.<eos> So not only do you two take money that doesn't belong to you, but you also decide to bury the body.
We've been tracking you for a while.<eos> Every time there's some crazy bullshit going on, it's you people.<eos> It's not hard to follow you.<eos> What's hard is guessing what you're gonna do next.<eos> Lucky for you, one of our drones spotted you shortly before a zombie knocked it out of the air.
You still got it?<eos> Oh-ho! Let's go, hotshot.<eos> Bring it!<eos> You coming?<eos> You kids go have fun-- I'll catch up with you.
But I checked with his credit card companies.<eos> As soon as he got into town, he rented a 40-foot sailboat.<eos> That boat's got to be how they're planning to get the treasure off the island.<eos> GABRIEL: Wow.<eos> Getting answers out of you two is like pulling teeth.
How can I convince you to back me for regency?<eos> You can't.<eos> In truth, I only came here to see how far you would stoop.<eos> It seems you would go so far as to dangle your daughter like a common whore.<eos> What wrong have I done you?
Your Highness.<eos> Congratulations on your victory in Scotland.<eos> Well, I couldn't have tricked Elizabeth without you, Nicholas.<eos> Your spying played an instrumental role.<eos> Clearly I underestimated you.
It is a fact of our time.<eos> A man rules his wife, even if his wife is a queen.<eos> I will not be laid low by any man.<eos> I will not be ruled by anyone.<eos> This choice will leave you open to unsavory unions.
Why do you refuse to see the truth?<eos> That a monarchy needs more than a ruler, it needs an heir.<eos> If you never wed, you will always be vulnerable to a queen who will marry.<eos> Mary knows that, and when her husband dies, she'll take another.<eos> With this choice, you will ensure that Mary, Queen of Scots, will forever threaten you.
My name is Louis Scrivner.<eos> Do you know who I am?<eos> Y-You're the Chief Technology Officer of the NSA.<eos> We were told you had a deal proposal?<eos> If Solomon is to help you, we must have assurances that no charges will be filed.
Citadel vetted Moore and the security guard that killed him.<eos> Best assessment team in the world struck out twice with the same agency?<eos> Best case scenario, criminal negligence.<eos> Worst case scenario, conspiracy inside the firm.<eos> Why don't you take Talia with you to interview Emily Moore?
Checkmate and all of that.<eos> Now for sure you got a question to ask me, don't you?<eos> Aah! You want to know... who gave me the names of the Federal Agents that shot my little brother.<eos> You guys don't got a clue.<eos> One of your own... is gonna burn you down from the inside.
Hey, Jerry, you okay?<eos> Uh, blood pressure's a little high.<eos> Otherwise, I'm good.<eos> Manager got a little roughed up, but I think everyone else is just a little freaked out.<eos> Oh, this is Lia, the phlebotomist I told you about.
Honey, you know, we have something to tell you...<eos> We are excited about a quickie.<eos> I just want to say that you guys were right, so thank you for pushing me.<eos> I was really uptight, but with AnniAn I'm finally relaxing.<eos> So I'll see you tonight. All right? Ba-da-pa.
We had a very, uh, productive conversation.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Is that-- is that blood on your collar?<eos> What have you done?<eos> Hey, look, I told you I would fix it, so I did.
No.<eos> We're still looking into our victim's phone records and social media, but so far, we haven't found anyone named Falcon.<eos> But we did find a possible link to a company called the Falcon Unit.<eos> We're checking them out now.<eos> Why bother when I could just tell you who they are?
We're bound by God.<eos> He loves it here at court.<eos> His life is here at court, not on some family farm he cares little about.<eos> What did you say to him, Amy, to convince him to leave?<eos> I'm sure he'll tell you himself.
I'll see that the carriage is ready.<eos> Good morning, Alexandra.<eos> Is it?<eos> What happened there?<eos> The last time I saw you two together, she was quite
I think a woman might do the trick quite nicely.<eos> Melancholia.<eos> A common affliction.<eos> There are too many women whose, um... pardon me... sexual appetites go unsatisfied.<eos> Does your husband neglect you? Mmm. And yet what would I be without him?
A war profiteer and a traitor to France.<eos> So you get rid of me.<eos> What comes next?<eos> You have an endless line of enemies who will do everything they can to prevent you from gaining power.<eos> The council despises you, Catherine.
Detectives, please.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You two depend on each other for your lives out there.<eos> But from what I am seeing...<eos> I'm sorry, but I am going to recommend that the two of you split up as partners.
But damn it, I understand there's a bunch of Canadians here, and I'm gonna do something about it!<eos> All right, everyone, listen up.<eos> In order for better understanding, we have asked students of Canadian origin to introduce you to their culture and...<eos> Hey, Leslie, shut your mouth! ...<eos> To introduce you to their culture and customs.
So let's give them our undivided attention as they take us on a whirlwind journey through their diverse history.<eos> We are the Hopewell and Abenaki, first settlers of Canadian soil, guy.<eos> We are French and British explorers, seeking furs and goods.<eos> Yeah, and I'm Dan Rather, and I got news for you...<eos> Nobody wants you here!
That's awesome!<eos> Guess you guys got my overflow... trickle down love-onomics.<eos> - Racism?<eos> - Why am I a teardown?<eos> Your girlfriends asked me to ask you if you guys want to group-date.
There's a certain quality to the vibe and energy that is SodoSopa, from the independent merchants and unique cafes to the rustic charm of a mixed-income crowd.<eos> Where else can you let loose your wild side while still being a part of helping the local economy?<eos> And now a chance to own a piece of this most exciting area of South Park.<eos> Announcing The Lofts at SodoSopa.<eos> 2,000-square-foot flats that put you right in the heart of it all.
Wasn't there anybody safe?<eos> Anywhere?<eos> There are.<eos> Few and far between.<eos> So what does bring you to California?
And then some German idiots appeared and started to play things no one could understand.<eos> Of course they lost it and started throwing things at us, lighters, small bottles, rocks.<eos> It was a nightmare!<eos> I think it was the worst concert ever!<eos> At the end, the event organizer even said to us, I remember you should be glad they didn't throw half a goat at you.
My, my, my.<eos> So, what brings you here?<eos> Oh, for a start, he owed you $75,000.<eos> Not to mention, he caved in your collection guy's skull with a baseball bat.<eos> Yeah, yeah, listen, guys, let me tell you about that...
Cause and effect.<eos> Wrongful death spawns a vengeful spirit.<eos> Chester. Uhh! Aah!<eos> All right, I think it's, uh, time we gotta get out of here.<eos> Here's hoping something less murderous brings you back to Minnesota, like Prince or cheese curd fest.
That seems like a lot of trouble to go to for a Nokia phone and a wallet.<eos> - What are you suggesting?<eos> - He's asking if you can remember<eos> - anything at all about your attackers?<eos> - And I've told you, no.
Yeah, it's definitely one of those.<eos> Come on.<eos> Our shame can choke us, kill us.<eos> It can rot us from the inside... if we decide to let it.<eos> Don't let that happen to you.
He bragged about it in a song.<eos> He's just trying to sell records.<eos> Or however you make money now.<eos> He was with us, celebrating my birthday the night of this murder.<eos> Then why wouldn't he offer you as an alibi?
So I will just leave you to that.<eos> We were just wondering in case any of the errands run long, uh, are we covering for one person or two?<eos> I got no idea what you're talking about.<eos> Got eyes on our boy.<eos> And nobody asked you to cover.
It is likely you are the only Englishman to express sympathy at the death of Marie de Guise.<eos> I may be the enemy, but I'm not without my manners.<eos> The same can't be said for your queen, Sir Nicholas.<eos> Considering the amount of pressure my mother was under from the English... pressure that I'm sure contributed to her ill health... it's not surprising Elizabeth didn't send her condolences.<eos> What interests you more... words or actions?
‚ô™ Where has the time gone ‚ô™ ‚ô™ if you're ever feeling lonely, ‚ô™<eos> ‚ô™ if you're ever feeling down ‚ô™ ‚ô™ you should know you're not the ‚ô™<eos> ‚ô™ only one who's feeling that way now ‚ô™<eos> ‚ô™ when the world is on your ‚ô™ ‚ô™ shoulders and you only need me, ‚ô™<eos> ‚ô™ need me you know love will set you free ‚ô™
Why did you keep it a secret?<eos> You figured shaft never cooked for his friends, so neither could you?<eos> It's adorable.<eos> And there it is. Need I say more?<eos> Yeah, I figured I'd find you down here.
What's wrong?<eos> The lights just flickered.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Come on.<eos> Okay, they found you.
Fornicators!<eos> Film watchers!<eos> Fashionistas!<eos> Single mothers!<eos> A demonic spirit is workin' in your life, leading you to the gangsters and witch doctors of Tower Hamlets, giving them the last of your cash monies for drugs and this ting.
Raymond!<eos> Hi.<eos> Oh, it's been so long.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Haven't seen you since, you know.
Both of you sit down.<eos> I have reached my decision.<eos> Raymond is coming to the party.<eos> Yes!<eos> It's a smart precedent to set, because after what I heard here today, I think there is a big chance that both of you are going to be left out.
I shouldn't be listening to this.<eos> Elizabeth is my cousin and a fellow queen.<eos> Nonsense.<eos> You love it.<eos> You feel the French nobles judging you?
- of the vote.<eos> - Motions on timing?<eos> What, you can't even vote on when to take a vote?<eos> I support your process in these complex times.<eos> I'll simply remind you that with me as regent you not only get a woman who stood at the side of the last two great kings, you have a woman.
- I do.<eos> Perhaps we could take advantage of your extended stay.<eos> I thought we might entertain ourselves with the Hound and Hare game you spoke of.<eos> I shouldn't delay my departure.<eos> And you made it clear that such games don't interest you.
In my version of the game, you are the hound and I am the hare.<eos> Does the notion upset you?<eos> No, not a bit.<eos> Although...<eos> I do wonder why it all matters so much to you.
RJ's off getting spoiled by his mom.<eos> I've got him every second weekend.<eos> We're here to talk to you, actually.<eos> Thought maybe you could explain why you choked Mr. Hayden.<eos> Who told you I choked him?
Lies.<eos> I am Drax the destroyer.<eos> Who else would I be?<eos> Something's making you all act like your old selves.<eos> What is wrong with you people?
And together, I can make you more money than you ever dreamed of.<eos> - You need to trust me.<eos> - Do you?<eos> He is the one who's hiding the truth.<eos> Imani betrayed you.
Look, I only came here for the free food.<eos> There's no food.<eos> Your guests are making the dinner.<eos> It's like you didn't even want to have a party.<eos> Did somebody force you to have this party?
What, she just left you here by yourself?<eos> I would kill you.<eos> She said she'll be right back.<eos> Although, we all know how night calls go.<eos> I might be asking one of you for a ride home.
- You said nobody would ever find out.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Shh.<eos> Look, we can't talk about this here, okay?<eos> I will give you whatever you want, but you have to go.
Yeah.<eos> And, see, cops don't shoot the suspects they have in custody...<eos> it's against the law.<eos> So, now that my men have their guns out, why don't you put yours down and we can call it a night?<eos> Or you could kill me, and then they'll kill you.
No, we don't need a picture.<eos> We just need a couple more...<eos> Wait, you don't want a picture with Santa?<eos> We're almost done. Guys,<eos> I'm gonna have to move you along. GENE: Hey!
He's really your friend, because he's not charging you.<eos> Do you know how lucky you are?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm the luckiest guy on Earth.<eos> All right, I'm taking you both home.
You know what he is, a superhero.<eos> A selfless defender of those who can't defend themselves.<eos> I see.<eos> I don't want to pretend I know how to do your job, but it just seems to me, your best bet would be to aim a floodlight into the night sky with his logo burned into it.<eos> I'm sure he'd find you.
People, I have huge news!<eos> Who's carrying the rest of it in?<eos> I found a way to improve diner business, and the crazy part is I don't have to fire you two.
I mean, if you're sure that's okay.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, it's okay.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Then... I guess I'll see you later tonight.
And forsaking all others, I will love and honor you...<eos> You okay?<eos> Luisa, you take these vows...<eos> What's going on?<eos> May God's grace bless you and bring strength to your commitment and bless you with the glorious power of his love.
He plays kickball?<eos> Equipment manager.<eos> Now that we're learning to communicate constructively, let's put those new skills to use.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I want everyone to write down everything about your partner that drives you crazy.
- Oh, no, I've had enough, I'll just...<eos> Oh, well, yeah, I'll have a Diet Coke. But what are you having?<eos> - Um, whisky.<eos> OK! - Yeah, OK, I'll have one of those.<eos> We thought we lost you to Elsa and Anna over there.
He came to us, asking for help, with a personal and emotional journey he was making.<eos> - And you've just turned it into a farce.<eos> - Sophie...<eos> You're all so paranoid!<eos> You think everybody's out to take something from you.
Well, after that debacle, I definitely don't want to hear any more Christmas wishes. And that's my Christmas wish,<eos> Huh?<eos> Ow, ow, all right.<eos> Look, I know I always joke around, but if I'm going to be honest with you guys.<eos> This has been the time of my life hanging out with you and, I love you.
You wanna become like me?<eos> Dong-myung entertainment section.<eos> She went to report on WOO's condition.<eos> Why didn't you tell me!<eos> Eating nuts in the morning is good for you.
Oi! You!<eos> You're not welcome at this rally.<eos> You're not welcome on this site and you're not welcome in this hobby.<eos> This is my site.<eos> I led you here.
You're not special.<eos> There are literally millions of other worlds with millions of other yous.<eos> We are special.<eos> Your Danny told us we were and this guy keeps trying to kill us, so...<eos> The best you can do is keep your fucking heads down and hope to hell that nobody notices you.
Ching Ching, take Little Guizi to your room and give her the medicine.<eos> Yes.<eos> - Just to be clear,<eos> I won't go with you girls<eos> I have already warned you all, I'll leave now
Why, your face...<eos> - He's getting away!<eos> Stop him!<eos> - Stop!<eos> I command you.
What's goin' on?<eos> (sighs) all right.<eos> Look, when the skull hijacked my armor and unlocked our playbook,<eos> He got our secrets.<eos> I put you all in danger.
The last place was very tight between Nathan and Luke.<eos> Both scores somewhat disappointing, but one of you will have to go to Cambridge.<eos> So, by the smallest fraction of a point, the last place on the team goes to...<eos> Nathan.<eos> The six of you will be hosting the Chinese team at your own homes and I'll see you all in Cambridge next week.
All I'm saying is if you'd lent me the money<eos> Oh, it's my fault that you're a thief?<eos> Lucky I am, otherwise you wouldn't have got to watch the take-off.<eos> Did you think about that?<eos> Get these over to the linen press in the hospital and ask the ward sister if she needs you this afternoon.
"gone"?<eos> What do you mean, "gone"?<eos> How?<eos> The spell brought us here to you, so it has to be here.<eos> Your spell brought you to the source of the blade's power.
The war's over.<eos> Y-You have the... nerve to say that to me?<eos> Who's your contact?<eos> I want... the name of your contact, your handler.<eos> I give you my word, this will go easier for you if you cooperate.
Ma!<eos> (WHISPERS) Ma... ..let her sleep.<eos> Tonight.<eos> Tomorrow, dishes.<eos> Now, I hope you won't mind if I leave you both alone for a few days.
Good night.<eos> - Hey, Gennaro.<eos> - Good evening.<eos> Why did you make that mess?<eos> Is Fabbretti no good for you anymore?
We have a problem.<eos> - Oh. Hi.<eos> Um... I-I like your cardigan.<eos> Oh. Oh, don't you "Hi" me.<eos> Your father leaves you alone for one night, and you go and do this.
You have to go back tomorrow.<eos> I'm not living with him anymore.<eos> Not after what happened.<eos> Here we go!<eos> The two of you love drama, don't you?
Don't be afraid of me.<eos> Do you have a name?<eos> Or should we baptize you?<eos> We'll baptize you too.<eos> I brought you all here today because I have something important to say to you.
I thought about what you said.<eos> You're right.<eos> Metatron, he's something needs to be done.<eos> And we should trust you why?<eos> Because I can give him to you.
- Externally?<eos> Me or Odysseas?<eos> - Can you do not remember him?<eos> - No.<eos> When he left you, you have not eaten for days.
He was lucky.<eos> He shot the guy in the leg.<eos> - He will survive.<eos> - Thank God.<eos> The police is after you.
Of course not.<eos> To see Alejandro killed like that.<eos> And now his family has arrived for the funeral.<eos> How's that going?<eos> Renata wanted me to thank you both for taking such good care of her nephew.
Alejandro, he left most of his money to charity.<eos> His aunt only got the house, and she can't afford to maintain it, so it's gonna be sold.<eos> Well... uh, can we at least stay here while you try to sell it?<eos> Well, actually, we have a buyer, and he's paying cash.<eos> But he's gonna need you out by Friday.
It's like someone threw up the cast of Glee on our bleachers. - BOTH:<eos> It's sick!<eos> - Okay, enough!<eos> I didn't recruit you guys to film the Blair Bitch Project.<eos> Now get to work, or I will strap you down and make you watch it gets better videos until you bleed empathy.
Don't do it, Charlotte!<eos> No!<eos> No, I have to!<eos> Murphy, this is not happening.<eos> I can't let any of you get hurt anymore.
He's slipping!<eos> Not everything out here is easily explained. That's it!<eos> Wormholes.<eos> We're the matter slipping between infinite variations of the same reality.<eos> You boys have a demon after you.
Okay.<eos> I won't go.<eos> In my line of work, you see everything.<eos> All the dirty little secrets people try to hide.<eos> The things I could tell you.
Sarah, Joe, he's here, he's at the end of the street.<eos> SARAH: Alice, he's here. (SIGHS)<eos> Right, me and Jim will go downstairs with you.<eos> Just open the door, tell him the Russian gentlemen have arrived, get him inside.<eos> No, he might see you.
Let's find out.<eos> This is madness.<eos> You lied about your family.<eos> So why should we believe anything else you've told us?<eos> Because everything I've told you has played out just as I said it would.
What happens in the end?<eos> He sails away on a turtle?<eos> Sails away on a turtle!<eos> You see, friends?<eos> Don't let the naysayers get you down.
I was trying to tell you, my boy.<eos> This place is no longer home.<eos> Bring these two to the palace.<eos> Signora?<eos> Who did this to you?
What I'm saying is that you got to challenge yourself.<eos> Okay, I'm gonna stop you right there, because yesterday, I made a decision that addresses all of your concerns.<eos> What's that?<eos> I'm joining the wrestling team.<eos> See you two at dinner.
- You're not special!<eos> I know the words to a lot of Disney tracks!<eos> - Okay.<eos> - And musicals.<eos> Okay, you guys are making a scene, and I don't think the kids want you here, so please...
Never doubt me.<eos> Never.<eos> Boys, I'm unarmed.<eos> Permit me a blade, at least.<eos> Did Sam send you? Clang! Hey!
Now that you've slept with Klaus, I mean, how was it?<eos> I am so not answering that.<eos> Oh, you so are.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Took you long enough.
You're two blocks from home.<eos> Would you mind holding out, considering I saved your lives?<eos> Word of advice, keep a low profile.<eos> This is exactly where Markos doesn't want you to be.<eos> If a traveler spots you, you're going right back to that camp.
Okay.<eos> Uh, is Nora a bitch?<eos> That was blunter than I had intended.<eos> Here's the thing.<eos> I know I'm putting you in a very uncomfortable position, and I apologize, but I can't tell you how many times this has happened to me. I get involved with someone, I think I know who they are, and then... bam... they turn out to be somebody else.
Your butt, your boobs, your mouth, it makes me so horny.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm sorry I was being mean.<eos> You're obviously three beautiful girls.<eos> I was just negging you, you know?
Good evening.<eos> I have a pickup for Haley.<eos> Yeah, that's me.<eos> - Please!<eos> - I swear to God, I will throw my dick at you.
Supposedly taking our own belongings?<eos> It's not even a crime.<eos> Maybe not, but murder is.<eos> What murder?<eos> Oh. Your friend Amber didn't tell you, did she?
You really are that stupid.<eos> You called Troy at the strip club and told him he had to get home because your dog was sick.<eos> I know because he called me while he was driving here.<eos> I also know that you threatened to kill him when he told you he was leaving you for me.<eos> Leaving all of you for me.
Almost 500 pesetas.<eos> - Five hundred.<eos> - And the smokes.<eos> For the ride.<eos> I told you, nobody lives there. It's abandoned.
Are you okay?<eos> I need some fresh air.<eos> Norman.<eos> You guys must be exhausted.<eos> I'm gonna have a deputy take you home.
You know her?<eos> Braeden.<eos> Who's Braeden?<eos> She's a mercenary.<eos> Right now, I'm the only one who's gonna take you to La Iglesia.
Oh, yeah?<eos> Yeah.<eos> But what we really wanted, though, was military, but then, you know, you got to be on base all day and shit.<eos> But a lawman, though... a lawman get to have his nights to himself.<eos> So what held you back?
What?<eos> A rat.<eos> What the hell?<eos> Hey, take a walk, bouncy boobs.<eos> All right, none of you bitches better come near me.
Goin' cheap as well.<eos> Thought we could get down there an' make ourselves new dresses.<eos> Is it smuggled silk?<eos> Now, listen here, missy, your uncle's got another mouth to feed now so we can't go paying out for everything.<eos> I'll starve then, if it helps you.
‚ô™ And I want yo to know, baby ‚ô™ That's no coinkydink.<eos> Excuse me. ‚ô™ I, I love you like a love song, baby ‚ô™<eos> I can't believe you.<eos> You spied on us?<eos> Why would I spy on you?
Excuse me. ‚ô™ I, I love you like a love song, baby ‚ô™<eos> I can't believe you.<eos> You spied on us?<eos> Why would I spy on you?<eos> That would mean I'd have to look at you up close and you're bad enough from afar, far away.
Please help her.<eos> "Woe to the inhabitants of the earth and of the sea!<eos> For the devil has come down unto you with great wrath because he knoweth that he hath but a short time."<eos> Revelations 12:12.<eos> I see the end of the world urges you onto greater efforts.
See you next time, Governor.<eos> Just attending to the poor.<eos> No doubt... and the poor in spirit.<eos> Captain Alden, right?<eos> I haven't seen you since we were children.
Thank you.<eos> Well, he is, you know?<eos> Beady eyes, a bespoke suit, the feud over granny's will -- prime suspect.<eos> I am gonna find a cup of tea, sit down and relax, and read this newspaper.<eos> Call you later.
Yeah, you, too.<eos> Hey.<eos> How you doing?<eos> All right.<eos> Just got word that the FBI has officially hired you as consultants for the case.
- The kidnapper led you here.<eos> - Agent Dunn?<eos> - Agent Dunn? - Uh, y-y-yes.<eos> We discovered this while attempting to trap the kidnappers.<eos> I understand that the kidnapper, who you lost, led you here.
This pep talk sucks.<eos> You want to call him?<eos> Who?<eos> Your brother.<eos> Wasn't his fault they split you up.
- No, the Pope.<eos> Did Austin send you out here to fend me off?<eos> No. No, he didn't.<eos> Elise, why don't you and the children come with me?<eos> I haven't seen you in so long.
Offended.<eos> Moving on.<eos> Dyson, you'll go in as Efficiency Consultant.<eos> Now listen, this building is rigged with the latest heat sensor security.<eos> If either one of you gets flustered or nervous, big brother is alerted.
Moving on.<eos> Dyson, you'll go in as Efficiency Consultant.<eos> Now listen, this building is rigged with the latest heat sensor security.<eos> If either one of you gets flustered or nervous, big brother is alerted.<eos> I have managed to hack you into the heat signature system.
You're not pixie, you're a mermaid.<eos> And you're my new bottom half.<eos> I don't get it, why would you hire us if you thought your own brother did it?<eos> I thought he was trying to get rid of me.<eos> So I hired you to play detective to get rid of him.
You cannot feel his love.<eos> Many of you suffer greatly.<eos> You feel that you're lost in a dark wilderness.<eos> But I tell you this...<eos> If you will put your trust in God and Jesus, and in me, then he will lead you to green pastures and your suffering will have ending.
He's the murderer.<eos> Harry saw him through the door.<eos> Mary Yellan's with him now and she's in danger.<eos> Oh, yeah? And he just forgot to mention it before, then, did he?<eos> It's London and the gallows for you.
Shall we take a photo?<eos> - Photo?<eos> Alka.<eos> Lay down your weapons and surrender.<eos> The police have surrounded you.
Hey!<eos> Who the hell are you pointing your guns at my dog?<eos> US Marshals. Could you please restrain this<eos> - animal?<eos> - What can I do you for?
Tim, what do you think?<eos> History of violence, in a hurry somewhere with a gun, the victim was a CI against him-<eos> - I say we let him go.<eos> Hold on a second.<eos> I'm the one who volunteered the very information that led you to the man's body.
We're all going to die.<eos> He's in quarantine, in a coma.<eos> Monica's with him now.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> The doctor checked you both out?
From Ivan.<eos> He told me that the marriage was your idea.<eos> And nothing but a cover.<eos> We loved each other.<eos> Our operatives have had you under surveillance for months.
Besides, even if he wasn't in prison, he doesn't want us.<eos> - How do you know that?<eos> - I used to write to him.<eos> He stopped writing a long time ago.<eos> I just don't understand why you're so sure he just abandoned you.
- I used to write to him.<eos> He stopped writing a long time ago.<eos> I just don't understand why you're so sure he just abandoned you.<eos> It's like you automatically assume that everybody gives up on you.<eos> Maybe he's... maybe he's looking for you.
Ready?<eos> Five minutes, I swear.<eos> Look, I took a leave.<eos> I'm gonna get out of town for a little while.<eos> You need to stop these assholes so I'm gonna help you.
- Who told him?<eos> I don't know how or why.<eos> - I just know she's out.<eos> - Is that bad?<eos> I suppose now you'll want me to take you out of Wonderland before she finds you.
Absolutely.<eos> No question.<eos> I can't wait. Are we there yet?<eos> Fourteen hundred acres supporting 40 souls.<eos> God smiles on you.
Let's go.<eos> - Whoo! - This place is crazy.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, there he is.<eos> Hey, I know you two.
I don't understand.<eos> The reason you can't remember what happened next is because we're your memory.<eos> Moloch took us out of your head.<eos> You and Jenny both.<eos> What do you mean he took you out of my head?
I don't understand.<eos> The reason you can't remember what happened next is because we're your memory.<eos> Moloch took us out of your head.<eos> You and Jenny both.<eos> What do you mean he took you out of my head?
If you don't testify, I'm going to arrest you for accessory to murder.<eos> Take a day.<eos> Pray on it.<eos> My favorite kind of birds.<eos> The kind that can't shit on you.
I need to know where you stand.<eos> You're going to have to choose between boosting your career or having to destroy me, what would you do?<eos> I mean, we all got to make hard choices, like rolling the hard 6, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> If I discover something about you that I knew would destroy you, I wouldn't use it.
‚ô´ There's an anchor chained to your body ‚ô´<eos> ‚ô´ I want you untrussed and alive ‚ô´<eos> ‚ô´ It goes deeper than you've ever shown me ‚ô´<eos> ‚ô´ I hear you calling ‚ô´<eos> ‚ô´ To understand you more ‚ô´
Great.<eos> My dad is not coming.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> Nah. This isn't gonna take long.<eos> He doesn't want you at his party.
My dad is not coming.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> Nah. This isn't gonna take long.<eos> He doesn't want you at his party.<eos> If you show up, they'll stop you at the door.
What if he's right?<eos> About what?<eos> Being chosen.<eos> He's crazy.<eos> Don't let him suck you in.
I don't know, but he thinks it's going to get him off.<eos> I'm going to deal with Toby.<eos> No.<eos> Now is not the time to go in hot.<eos> Did it ever occur to you that I just might have a plan?
I'm going to deal with Toby.<eos> No.<eos> Now is not the time to go in hot.<eos> Did it ever occur to you that I just might have a plan?<eos> Why don't I get the driver to take you home?
He was ready to move on, all right?<eos> - A new love and a new life-- - No.<eos> I just want to do the same thing.<eos> No, he wasn't gonna do that to you.<eos> - No, he loved you.
It's one more thing you didn't know about him.<eos> Come on, Moonlight, let's go.<eos> I know that he wouldn't want "Bathwater" lost forever, and I know that he wrote code, so I think he's trying to tell us where it is, or maybe who killed him or, I don't know, something else.<eos> Thought I left all this behind me.<eos> It'll still be waiting for you when you get back to San Vicente.
The guy that manages her money owed me favor.<eos> Keith, come on.<eos> This isn't 'cause I wanna hurt Tessie.<eos> This is about the son that God gave me.<eos> Now, if you can't get somebody to trust you, you gotta get 'em to need you.
It wasn't Dominican music. It was Dominican cigar smoke.<eos> And the reason I know that is 'cause I used to tell him his room smells like a "Soprano's" episode.<eos> Is there some memory where he substitutes one person for another?<eos> No. No, just little--<eos> What if it's not a person that he's leading you to?
- I can't.<eos> - Why?<eos> I'm working on something.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> This is what undoes you: your lying, the secrecy.
‚ô´ Get back to the place you lost inside ‚ô´<eos> ‚ô´ Beak out from those rusted chains ‚ô´<eos> - What he fuck happened?<eos> - He was ready for me.<eos> What do you mean, he was ready for you?
He was gonna have to get the murder charges dropped or he was burn right alongside me.<eos> I want you to keep that for me.<eos> No, I'm not getting involved.<eos> You're already involved, Paul.<eos> God involved you the day you baptized me.
- You sure?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> All right. I'll see you around.<eos> A little tight. Have you been guilt eating?<eos> Fuck you, Randy.
I don't know.<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Look, Pop.<eos> I know you still sour about the name change.<eos> But Pernell did apologize, and he owes you now.
His name was Lucky.<eos> When I pulled his strings, I felt no fear.<eos> - [door closes] - In here, preacher boy.<eos> What the fuck are you doing here?<eos> I'm the one who brought you here.
Oh. What's it called?<eos> Hexagram?<eos> - Hexagon.<eos> - I'm curious.<eos> What inspired you to go with that shape?
Silent corpses, the stench of betrayal...<eos> It's grotesque and macabre.<eos> As if it were my home.<eos> Juli, I'm not in the mood for an absurd speech.<eos> All that riding seems to have upset you.
- Nothing, except... I imagine you have returned the favour.<eos> Don't get caught in her web, Llu√≠s.<eos> Why should I listen to you?<eos> I'm your best friend, remember?<eos> Trust me, and look after those who really need you.
- Then ask her to marry you, Llu√≠s.<eos> OK.<eos> But when they get here, you have to disappear.<eos> Look, there's Daddy!<eos> I thought I'd never hold you again.
Then you take him!<eos> Sorry, I don't feel well.<eos> What have you done now?<eos> Go easy on her.<eos> What's got into you?
- The whole village knows!<eos> It's so humiliating. Don't touch me!<eos> Never touch me again!<eos> Trini.<eos> I knew you couldn't love me like I loved you, but I never thought you'd become a fraud and a cynic.
The only person who really loved me, the only one who wanted to know me and who cared about what I needed.<eos> Go and have fun with that bunch of drunks.<eos> Ramonet and I won't bother you.<eos> I'm taking him back to Barcelona tomorrow.<eos> I missed you so much.
More rum?<eos> Yes, thank you.<eos> I didn't expect this warm welcome.<eos> You caught me in a good mood.<eos> That uniform suits you better.
- You think this will make it better?<eos> - Not for them.<eos> But for me.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I told you.
the sun has gone away, because it's very sleepy.<eos> Slowly, slowly, close your eyes, because you, my little girl, are the sun<eos> that I love the most.<eos> And the moon peeps through into the bedroom<eos> and tells you to go to sleep and not to be afraid.
- There's a roof.<eos> - And it all belongs to the bank.<eos> How am I going to bail Troy out of jail?<eos> He got himself in there.<eos> How about you just go out there and mow the grass like I asked you?
You hungry?<eos> - What?<eos> - Let's get lunch.<eos> You know, I'd love to, but I got to go get that paycheck.<eos> Have them send it to you.
For what that's worth.<eos> I should have shot you the other day. He said you were an intruder.<eos> I understand.<eos> Listen.<eos> You remember the address that Audrey gave you on the phone this morning?
Protomolecule seems tobehaveuniquely ineachsubject, mutatingrapidly ineachdifferentbiomass.<eos> Thelevelof theinformation densityrequired forthevarietyofoutcomes I'mseeingis of amagnitude Ican'texplain.<eos> "Protomolecule." They gave the goddamn thing a name.<eos> Phoebe station is where it all started.<eos> These must be the martians that Lopez told you about.
There's already a lot more do-gooders than we expected.<eos> -Next will be the looters.<eos> -Then get rid of them.<eos> I'll sacrifice what's left of my credibility for a few short-term trinkets.<eos> You're witnessing a discovery that could rewrite the story of humankind, but your imagination takes you as far as putting the boot heel to your former colony.
Naomi: You okay there?<eos> Ithinkallthatradiation failedtogivemesuperpowers.<eos> Usually, when we're in dangeroussituations, youhideyournerves byaskingweird, inappropriatequestions.<eos> Holden: Do I? Naomi:<eos> Mmm. Naomi: I hope that hasn't been irradiatedoutof you.
Teddy the detector, this guy was not!<eos> Who?<eos> Teddy the detector!<eos> Yeah!<eos> The little kid, the little robot, teaches you about the air sensors, no?
- It's a very alarming charge.<eos> - The Russians hacked our committees.<eos> The continuation of endless war.<eos> Can't you get that through your fucking skull?<eos> The revolution will put you in the driver's seat.
That's Jacob, Dabi and Rebecca's third son.<eos> - Mm. - He's 6 now.<eos> Looks like his father.<eos> He's always getting into trouble, so naturally, he's my favorite.<eos> Does that bother you?
There's no bending with a fanatic.<eos> After you met him... You changed.<eos> Moshe opened my eyes to the false life that mother and father had us living... Exchanging Christmas presents with the neighbors, doing everything we could not to offend anyone with our Jewishness.<eos> Moshe made me proud to be a Jew.<eos> He turned you against your family.

This land was promised to Abraham.<eos> Ah, yes.<eos> Promise.<eos> A covenant with God made thousands of years ago.<eos> Doesn't that strike you as a form of insanity?
- Ah, I haven't seen it.<eos> - Yeah, you lived it, I guess.<eos> You wanna sit?<eos> No, I'm good.<eos> Hey, man, if I knew who you was, I never would've knocked you out.
!<eos> Fuckin' spaz.<eos> Fuck, man! Aah!<eos> So...<eos> That's the $2,000 I owe you.
Fuck, man! Aah!<eos> So...<eos> That's the $2,000 I owe you.<eos> Less the $2,000 you stole from me, leaves what?<eos> How much I owe you now?

He's been in the hospital, and now he's with us for a while.<eos> When do I meet him?<eos> You know what?<eos> You already have when you were a baby, at Aunt Maggie's.<eos> He bounced you on his knee, and you know what you did?
These I'm not even dealing with.<eos> It's just the Primidone.<eos> It's downstairs by his bed.<eos> I left it there.<eos> After he threw the glass at you.
Pick him up?<eos> Ask him about his travels.<eos> Tell me this, Dar.<eos> Off the record, just you and me.<eos> Does that sound like a solid intelligence-gathering effort to you, or does that sound like a way to provoke a crisis with Iran we inherit on inauguration day?
The money was for those tickets.<eos> - That's not what Saad is saying.<eos> - Well, Saad is lying, like he has since the very beginning.<eos> You got to get him on the stand, put him under oath.<eos> Like I told you, the judge won't allow it.
You got to get him on the stand, put him under oath.<eos> Like I told you, the judge won't allow it.<eos> Well, then I got to get up there.<eos> I would advise against it.<eos> They will question you for days about everything you ever said, everything you ever posted online.
What you looking at?<eos> Excuse us.<eos> We're not done here.<eos> Well, he needs to sit down.<eos> - Fuck you!
- Let's go! - Oww!<eos> Stop!<eos> Let him go!<eos> Let me go!<eos> Fuck you!
Just not at the moment to us.<eos> How do you get a drink in this place?<eos> Hey, baby!<eos> What...<eos> I thought I'd never find you again.
- What gang?<eos> - The one you got arrested with.<eos> I know everything... why you met Sekou, pretended you were Muslim, pretended you were his friend and mine.<eos> Pretended?<eos> So that's what she's been telling you?
You don't know anything.<eos> Was it in Pittsburgh when you met Conlin?<eos> Just keeps going.<eos> I already told you I don't know who this is...<eos> Did he threaten you with something you did?
- How could you do this to him? !<eos> - Hey, hey, hey, hey.<eos> Really? ! Huh?<eos> You fucked up by coming here.<eos> Fuck you, man.
Of course.<eos> But I do now.<eos> It was in Berlin.<eos> In a barracks in Dahlem.<eos> They poisoned you...
But I do now.<eos> It was in Berlin.<eos> In a barracks in Dahlem.<eos> They poisoned you...<eos> a cell did... and left you for dead.

Sekou, what were the terms of your release?<eos> What do you say to your social media profile?<eos> Did you provide names of other radicals?<eos> Does your family know you're free?<eos> Sekou, is it true your father radicalized you?
Sekou!<eos> - My God. What...<eos> - My sweet boy!<eos> Mom!<eos> I thought I'd lost you.
Demanding that I come here, putting everything at risk?<eos> - It's already at risk.<eos> - This is not safe, Saul.<eos> Ten miles from the border?<eos> The Israelis catch you, they'll just ask you some awkward questions.
Wrong address.<eos> I'm delivering it.<eos> - Where do you live?<eos> - Across the...<eos> I see you in here again, I call the police.
If somebody breaks in your home, logic dictates you do whatever it takes to get them out.<eos> You have no idea who I am, do you?<eos> I'm just some blonde lady who works with Reda.<eos> Basically.<eos> Would it surprise you to know that I sympathize with what you just said about defending your home?
- It's a very alarming charge.<eos> - The Russians hacked our committees.<eos> The continuation of endless war.<eos> Can't you get that through your fucking skull?<eos> The revolution will put you in the driver's seat.
- Conlin, wait.<eos> - That, I promise.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I said, "Wait."<eos> Doesn't seem wrong to you, being here?
I can't wait to get into the private sector.<eos> All that data they wouldn't let us touch.<eos> Can you believe the numbers they're throwing around here?<eos> I know.<eos> They say anything strange to you?
- It's a very alarming charge.<eos> - The Russians hacked our committees.<eos> The continuation of endless war.<eos> Can't you get that through your fucking skull?<eos> The revolution will put you in the driver's seat.
- Well, right.<eos> But...<eos> The problem is, they know it must have come from the NSA.<eos> Your organization's gonna be looking internally, so it's not gonna be enough just to say that.<eos> I didn't give it to you. Really.
Marines?<eos> I served.<eos> I did, too.<eos> Good for you.<eos> What happened to you?
- It's a very alarming charge.<eos> - The Russians hacked our committees.<eos> The continuation of endless war.<eos> Can't you get that through your fucking skull?<eos> The revolution will put you in the driver's seat.
I'm here.<eos> Everything's gonna be fine now.<eos> Oh, what's happening?<eos> Ugh. Nothing, nothing.<eos> You're just feeling the effects of the sedative the doctor gave you.
But the Director asked me to...<eos> Let me handle the Director.<eos> You can go.<eos> Ohh, I'm getting too old for this.<eos> They grilled you about your trip to the West Bank, huh?
But only one other person knew for sure.<eos> Dar Adal... I told him about it myself.<eos> The same Dar Adal who's been trying to undermine the nuclear deal every step of the way?<eos> That was over three years ago.<eos> If he was gonna burn you... time was then, not now.
He's a little hard to recognize, I admit.<eos> Wild guess...<eos> He's working for Mossad.<eos> For the past eight years.<eos> Including the little show they put on for you in Abu Dhabi.
Fair enough.<eos> For the record, though, I... I never forced myself on anyone.<eos> I'm not staying here.<eos> Yes, you are.<eos> Astrid will look after you till you can look after yourself.
What's it to you?<eos> Well, if you won't say, I will.<eos> It's Carrie Mathison.<eos> Her foundation represented the bomber.<eos> She's what's pulling you back to New York, isn't that it?
That I... flatlined and was dead for three minutes.<eos> Not exactly.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> You were in a coma, Peter, a deep coma.<eos> Carrie ordered the doctors to wake you up.
It's a very alarming charge.<eos> The Russians hacked our committees.<eos> The continuation of endless war.<eos> Can't you get that through your fucking skull?<eos> The revolution will put you in the driver's seat.
On the positive side, the shrink said expect to hear from him soon.<eos> Plus, he was smiling, so...<eos> Fingers crossed.<eos> What's this?<eos> Um, according to cellphone records, it's where Conlin called you from just before he was killed.
I don't disagree.<eos> Then call them off.<eos> I can't.<eos> It's not up to me.<eos> I still have value to you, intelligence.
Order of the President-Elect her fucking self.<eos> Hold on, wait.<eos> Just listen.<eos> - Listen to what? - Shh!<eos> If it makes any difference, some said ship you back to Tehran.
Can't stand the politics.<eos> Especially now.<eos> Oh, I hear you.<eos> God, I hear you.<eos> So, Max, did she tell you what the issue is?
What do we know, you and I?<eos> No such thing as private anymore, is there?<eos> M and M?<eos> That year, from here to here, I spent smoking meth and masturbating.<eos> What sent you into this tailspin?
Enjoy.<eos> You're not at the lake.<eos> No.<eos> Want to tell me why?<eos> If you won't say what's bothering you, how am I supposed to help?
- What guy?<eos> - The fucking guy!<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> You stay.<eos> I would never hurt you, Peter.
I got you out of lockup.<eos> So you knew where I was.<eos> In a safe place.<eos> That was the point.<eos> My God, I flew Astrid in all the way from Berlin to take care of you.
- Yeah?<eos> - What the fuck did you do?<eos> You sound terrible.<eos> I told you to leave him alone.<eos> And I told you there were other opinions.
Previously on Homeland...<eos> She's a Gold Star mom.<eos> She's tough to argue with.<eos> I applied for a job.<eos> It's where Conlin called you from just before he was killed.
It's a very alarming charge.<eos> The Russians hacked our committees.<eos> The continuation of endless war.<eos> Can't you get that through your fucking skull?<eos> The revolution will put you in the driver's seat.
- Nicki.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Hold-- hold on one second.<eos> Johnny!<eos> God, I swear, I didn't even recognize you!
For Christ's sakes, that's absurd, Saul.<eos> Harry and Leo would never believe that.<eos> No one would.<eos> What's really going on?<eos> I told you.
It's a very alarming charge.<eos> The Russians hacked our committees.<eos> The continuation of endless war.<eos> Can't you get that through your fucking skull?<eos> The revolution will put you in the driver's seat.
- This isn't Quinn, Carrie.<eos> Dar?<eos> What do you mean they're evacuating the hotel?<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - Fuck you, Dar!
Uh, how about we meet up<eos> - after work at the Hay-Adams?<eos> - How about we do it now?<eos> That way, you won't cancel on me again.<eos> I swear I'm not avoiding you, Saul.
Because I've known them forever.<eos> Because, as corny as it sounds, what they care about most is their country, and because they hate the press more than you do.<eos> See?<eos> What was I just saying?<eos> She never tells you what you want to hear.
_<eos> Aw, Carrie.<eos> Carrie.<eos> Saul?<eos> I swear. I was just about to call you.
'Cause they were coming for me.<eos> Who is?<eos> The people who built the bomb.<eos> You were in a coma, Peter.<eos> Carrie ordered the doctors to wake you up.
The people who built the bomb.<eos> You were in a coma, Peter.<eos> Carrie ordered the doctors to wake you up.<eos> She did this despite repeated warnings about the risks of the procedure.<eos> You think she's been taking care of you all these months out of love?

Remember Mr. Nafisi?<eos> Of course.<eos> Paymaster for the IRGC, all-around creep.<eos> Correct.<eos> It was me who recommended you for the mission.
Honestly, Saul, I... I didn't know whose side you were on.<eos> Five's the limit, pal.<eos> - Ooh. Sorry.<eos> - Hey.<eos> I see you in here again, I call the police.
- Tell me, then.<eos> - What?<eos> What did you come here for?<eos> Sorry?<eos> Dar Adal called you.
Quinn, what are you doing?<eos> Look.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> That's him, Carrie.<eos> The m-man who was-- watched you, put the bomb in the van.
It's a very alarming charge.<eos> The Russians hacked our committees.<eos> The continuation of endless war.<eos> Can't you get that through your fucking skull?<eos> The revolution will put you in the driver's seat.
Lights out.<eos> Nothing till tom-- morning.<eos> Good.<eos> Then maybe you can tell me what the hell is going on.<eos> Last time I saw you, you were being hauled off by orderlies at Bellevue.
I don't care.<eos> Yeah, well, I do.<eos> What is that supposed to mean?<eos> What, I don't care?<eos> I don't care so much I visited you in the hospital every day?
What our vision is is kind of we send you out there, sort of bearing witness to these bored, rich ladies who are taking surf culture, co-opting it, just turning it into basically, like, some shitty yoga,<eos> - which they've already ruined.<eos> - 100%.<eos> And then you look like the opposite of a surfer.<eos> You're just kind of wandering around, and, like, we just throw you in the mix.
Oh, shit. You know what?<eos> You've got a lot of pubic hair.<eos> What the fuck did you just say?<eos> No, I just noticed because I've seen a lot of different bushes around the world, and that's just, like, totally... it's its own style.<eos> Ah, for your information, this is what adult women look like when they're using their pubic hair the way that, like, whatever, the Lord intended, which is to protect their vagina, so thank you for pointing that out.
- It's salt.<eos> Tears, sweat, the sea.<eos> Think about it.<eos> I call it the big, blue medicine pill.<eos> Well, I told you I'm gonna sob, so I guess I'm getting it done.
You're worried she's gonna say no.<eos> You are such a guy, Charlie... in a good way.<eos> She's gonna say yes.<eos> Yeah, what makes you say that?<eos> Because I've seen the way that she looks at you and...
But another set of hands and eyes never hurts, right?<eos> And why should those hands and eyes belong to you?<eos> Just consider me your vascular parachute.<eos> Oh.<eos> No wonder I have you on nights.
Some people, you put them together, and no matter how much they love each other, they just don't work.<eos> They just don't.<eos> And if you deny that, it's dangerous.<eos> I don't believe that.<eos> You have a child who needs you, and nothing else matters.
You are never welcome here.<eos> My father asks for you to keep the hounds quiet.<eos> Thyra... if you do not comply, he will have them killed... again.<eos> And again, you shall bring me pups.<eos> He will have men hump you.
Vivat Rex Guthred!<eos> Vivat Rex Guthred!<eos> Guthred...<eos> Or do I now call you Lord?<eos> You can call me whatever pleases you.
I'm fine.<eos> Just a nosebleed.<eos> I take it you're here to yell at me about the book?<eos> What book?<eos> The one I gave Kevin. He didn't tell you?
Oh, no, he told me. I'm staying out of it.<eos> So, you wanna tell me where the man on the pillar is?<eos> It's my understanding he departed.<eos> I didn't witness it myself, but that's what people saw.<eos> People also saw you with his wife.
I've never seen anything like it.<eos> Except when you did it for Mary.<eos> I get it, Matt.<eos> She left.<eos> My heart breaks for both of you, but you making up this bullshit story about some nutjob departing--
Do you wanna go grab a drink?<eos> Can I take a rain check?<eos> I just got back from a business trip.<eos> Business trip?<eos> Christine called you?
- How big can I make it?<eos> You are a heartless bitch.<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey, God damn you!
Actually, I painted it myself.<eos> - You did not.<eos> - I did.<eos> Well, then you are incredibly talented.<eos> So, what brings you here, Frank?
You're building a boat.<eos> For the flood.<eos> I need to get to the hospital in Kurripa.<eos> Any chance you guys could give me a ride there?<eos> Lady of the house will take better care of you than the hospital.
You give them the money, they show you the thing, you see that it torches people, then you bust them.<eos> Right.<eos> But you don't have any jurisdiction in Australia.<eos> That is technically true.<eos> The DSD didn't send you.
- Just tell me what you fucking want.<eos> Why is this happening again?<eos> 'Cause I fucking finished this.<eos> So, what do you want?<eos> Did Patti send you?
What the fuck is going on?<eos> What?<eos> I have compassion for you because you are ill.<eos> I wanted to help.<eos> She told me to tell you that I was who you thought I was and then you'd go away.
Nora, your... Your sister?<eos> She's not picking up the phone either.<eos> But why would you know that?<eos> Because you're too busy chartering cargo planes to Australia.<eos> Tell me, Matt, does that seem reasonable to you?
Well, it must seem reasonable to you since you're trying to get on it.<eos> This is your fault, you self-righteous shit!<eos> Yeah, did you bring your whistle, Laurie?<eos> 'Cause it sounds like you need to blow off a little...<eos> - Fuck you!
I will talk to him.<eos> He didn't call you.<eos> - He called me.<eos> - And what exactly did he say?<eos> What did he specifically say that leads you to believe he's delusional?
- He called me.<eos> - And what exactly did he say?<eos> What did he specifically say that leads you to believe he's delusional?<eos> Did he see something or someone?<eos> Did... did she tell you?
She said he was upset.<eos> Upset about what, exactly?<eos> Because I'm getting the feeling we're not hearing the entire story.<eos> No, the whole story, Matt, is in your ridiculous book, which somehow you convinced my husband and my stepson to keep from me.<eos> Yeah, well, they kept it from you 'cause they knew this would be your reaction.
- Yes, sir.<eos> - Thank God. Our plane was forced to land and we're stranded here.<eos> No that Tasmania isn't lovely.<eos> Three tickets, please.<eos> Hey, fuck you, Matt.
I go by many names, but Mr. Burton is fine.<eos> I will not take a photo with you.<eos> There was no big bang.<eos> Just nothing, then light.<eos> Yes, I created you.
- Can you believe this guy?<eos> - It was just a joke.<eos> It's blasphemy, is what it is.<eos> You know he's not God.<eos> Why does it bother you?
He saw things that weren't there.<eos> How do you know? How do you know they weren't there?<eos> Because Patti is dead!<eos> Because Evie is dead! - If you wrote a book every time...<eos> Is that what he said when he called you?
God shall not be mocked.<eos> "For whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap."<eos> No, we're not reaping anyone, man.<eos> You used to burn men's houses down for pretending to be things they're not.<eos> What happened to you, John?
I didn't want to hurt you.<eos> I understand.<eos> I wouldn't have told me either.<eos> I understand, too.<eos> She was protecting you.
- Is it them?<eos> - You tell me.<eos> Dr. Bekker and Dr. Eden.<eos> Yeah, that's them.<eos> Told you it was the right house.
I'm of sound mind and body and give consent to go... to go wherever they went.<eos> Amen.<eos> So, the two women in that house, they recorded this?<eos> One would assume.<eos> And we're also assuming they're just gonna lead us right to this device they told you about?
That's why we're here.<eos> ‚ô™ Come while he waits... ‚ô™ - He's gonna find that body.<eos> - Well, let's hope he doesn't.<eos> It's gonna be okay, sweetie.<eos> Matt gave this to you?
No. She just shows up.<eos> She won't even tell us how she even knew we were here.<eos> You wanna disclose how you got that black eye?<eos> I got it from Nora.<eos> She hit you?
Erika never doubted it.<eos> She took it in and moved on.<eos> But me, I just... I just couldn't believe it.<eos> I should've told you.<eos> Well, if you had, I wouldn't have talked you into helping people talk to their dead relatives.
She took it in and moved on.<eos> But me, I just... I just couldn't believe it.<eos> I should've told you.<eos> Well, if you had, I wouldn't have talked you into helping people talk to their dead relatives.<eos> I thought I was helping you.
Same time next week?<eos> You're on.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hey.<eos> John called you?
I'm here to say good-bye.<eos> Want a cigarette?<eos> Yeah.<eos> "Don't forget me."<eos> Is this the lighter Jill gave you?
I didn't tell you because I didn't want to.<eos> And then... then I didn't have to.<eos> Are you scared?<eos> Scared of what?<eos> Scared of them strapping you to a seesaw and holding you under the water until you drown.
Well, enjoy your solitude.<eos> - I love you, Mom.<eos> - I love you, honey.<eos> Tell Tommy I love him.<eos> Mom loves you, you fucking idiot.
- I love you, Mom.<eos> - I love you, honey.<eos> Tell Tommy I love him.<eos> Mom loves you, you fucking idiot.<eos> I love you, too, Mommy!
You're just a puppet.<eos> That speech you just gave?<eos> Were those even your words?<eos> Because it didn't sound like you believed a single thing you were saying.<eos> You just do what they tell you to do.
Uh-huh. And who's that?<eos> His name is God.<eos> Tell her I love her, too.<eos> Where's the comms room?<eos> What is it with you and the fucking comms room?
I was worried you'd forgotten.<eos> Don't usually get so many so close together.<eos> Love is in the air.<eos> A little extra for your trouble.<eos> Sarah, does the name Kevin mean anything to you?
Anyway, I know it sounds crazy, but I felt a connection.<eos> So, you know, here we are in the middle of nowhere bumping into each other, and I'm only here for the night, and I figured, you know, if I didn't ask you to dance tonight... I'll never forgive myself.<eos> You need to leave now.<eos> Okay.<eos> I get it. A guy you barely remember shows up on your doorstep, asks you to go on a date with him, but...
- What do you want?<eos> Well, I want him to leave me alone.<eos> - Then why are you calling me?<eos> - What?<eos> Well, I can't make him leave you alone.
- You asked me to go to Miami?<eos> - Miami. Yes.<eos> But we were strangers?<eos> Yes.<eos> And you're giving me a hard time about inviting you to a dance?
When Matt told me you were gone, I didn't believe him.<eos> Or I couldn't.<eos> I had this feeling that you were still alive... and that I would see you again.<eos> And then... then Matt died and you weren't even at the funeral.<eos> And that should've convinced me, but I couldn't believe the last time I saw you or talked to you was in that fucking hotel room that night I burned his fucking book.
Just when I need to.<eos> - She knows you're here?<eos> - Don't be mad at her.<eos> She's my therapist.<eos> She wasn't allowed to tell you.
Did I wanna be with you, Kevin?<eos> Of course I did.<eos> But so much time had passed.<eos> It was too late.<eos> And I knew that if I told you what happened... that you would never believe me.
I'll confess.<eos> I'll do anything, just tell me what it is.<eos> It's simple.<eos> You tell me your sins.<eos> How you abused the gifts he gave you and then you pay your penance.
You're just this poor lost girl.<eos> Come here.<eos> I understand.<eos> You just needed him to be stronger.<eos> But he used you for sin.
Please.<eos> I'm sorry, I'll do anything.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> And your struggle will bring you closer.
Dammit, where are you, girl?<eos> Emilia!<eos> I'll find you!<eos> Where the fuck have you been?<eos> I told you to stay in the house.
I said I'd get my own fucking water if I needed it.<eos> But they didn't listen.<eos> They always wanna help.<eos> They want to help because then they own you.<eos> A man raises you after your mother dies and suddenly you're his property, no questions asked.

Oh, my God, no.<eos> No.<eos> Honey, honey?<eos> Who did this?<eos> Who did this to you?
Absolutely... absolutely you can not.<eos> The ones of us they don't get down here, we're just gonna swing in Port Royal in a few days.<eos> - Get up. Get up!<eos> - You gotta trust me.<eos> He asks you for a name, you don't say shit.
Yes, ma'am.<eos> There are some supplies that I would like to be transported over, too. Thank you.<eos> Go and find Mrs. Hannah.<eos> She'll know what to do.<eos> No one will harm you out there.
Go and find Mrs. Hannah.<eos> She'll know what to do.<eos> No one will harm you out there.<eos> How can you be so sure?<eos> Because they know if anything happens to you, Flint dies.
I just won't.<eos> I understand.<eos> You should be going.<eos> Eleanor Guthrie...<eos> Eleanor Guthrie told you she'd surrender the fort and all of Nassau with it if Flint agreed to act as her hostage to guarantee the deal?
Colonial Intelligence.<eos> That's the Walrus.<eos> Everything we've put that ship through... and she just refuses to die.<eos> It's fucking unnatural.<eos> They'll all follow you.
Nice try.<eos> I know that means Voldemort. Now I know he's single.<eos> Can you just make sure he's not tricking me or anything?<eos> Julian tried to sneak in a clause in our divorce agreement that said I could never remarry and had to die alone in a flea market.<eos> So how did he dump you?
Did you just get these today?<eos> You're not signing this.<eos> But the sticker says "Sign here."<eos> It's shaped like an arrow.<eos> Kimmy, this man put you through hell... cheating on you or whatever.
Child work rules were very different in the '70s.<eos> I was the only survivor of that shoot.<eos> Well, now, Sesame Street is casting, and I thought you might know someone there who could help me.<eos> Titus.<eos> You expect me to help you?
You fall asleep, dream you're French-kissing Ryan Seacrest, then you wake up, and it's two rats fighting over a hard-boiled egg in your mouth.<eos> No. I broke up with Bobby.<eos> And it was worse than I could have imagined.<eos> No.<eos> He killed you, and now you're a ghost?
You can't put this on yourself.<eos> Are you going to help me or not?<eos> Even if I do, how do you expect to get into the station?<eos> In the back of a patrol car.<eos> You're gonna let them arrest you?
Nah, he gonna do what he gonna do.<eos> Right?<eos> You know the man you married.<eos> Look.<eos> I'm out of here as soon as I get a location on the Dominican deal, but, uh, I'll leave a man behind to watch you, and Aisha can get you whatever you need.
Hey. What's wrong?<eos> Hey.<eos> Look at me.<eos> You have to finish mixing the explosives.<eos> Have you forgotten what these people did to you?
I don't work here anymore, Andy, it has to be you.<eos> - You can do this.<eos> - All right.<eos> Uh, hey, Tom.<eos> - Keith asked me to tell you to submit your debrief in writing this time.
_<eos> I think Amira's gonna do something.<eos> He thinks you're planning an attack at the school with someone.<eos> He doesn't know it's with me.<eos> I told him I've explained everything to you and you believed it.
Can anyone hear me?<eos> !<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Rebecca respects you.
Yes, I am.<eos> Now, he's up to speed on everything.<eos> He knows you need to get Grimes the money as soon as possible, so I'm gonna put him on.<eos> Carter, the police are giving you a vehicle and a comm package.<eos> A CTU tac team will follow you to your rendezvous with Grimes.
I'll make sure the tac team stays hidden.<eos> You're not hearing me.<eos> Ben is counter-surveillance trained, okay?<eos> He's also very paranoid.<eos> Carter, Grimes has already gotten away from you once.
Excuse me, ma'am.<eos> We're ready.<eos> She's in here.<eos> I had them set up video and audio before they sequestered her.<eos> Your guests are expecting you outside, you should get back to them.
I'll go upstairs.<eos> Drop it!<eos> I said drop it, now!<eos> Throw it down.<eos> I'll kill you.
I don't know what you're talking about!<eos> Stop right there.<eos> All right?<eos> I know what you was planning with Aisha.<eos> But right now, my men got you in their crosshairs.
Isaac, you sure she's okay?<eos> She good, bro.<eos> All right?<eos> You asked me to watch her, that's what I'm doing.<eos> I'll get her to call you.
I tweaked some parameters, so you're good to go.<eos> Can thank me later.<eos> I know you think Mullins is looking to get rid of you.<eos> How do you know what I think?<eos> Because whatever's on your mind hangs on you like a sign.
Okay, you need to get your hands on a syringe.<eos> As large as possible.<eos> Then, when the doctor leaves...<eos> Amira?<eos> I'll call you back.
We don't just go on our gut here, we make decisions based on Intel.<eos> And I cannot authorize this mission.<eos> There are too many variables.<eos> Appreciate all you've done for us today, but this is my call.<eos> - Agent Wilkes will take you to debrief.
And hopefully we can find out what he knows about Jadalla Bin-Khalid.<eos> You stole those schematics.<eos> When I've identified Gabriel, I'll look for a chance to lock him down.<eos> Have a TAC team standing by.<eos> Carter, you're predicating this entire plan on what Grimes told you.
That he wasn't alone.<eos> You were there with him.<eos> Tell me what you're doing here.<eos> Nothing.<eos> I already told you...
Amira, now!<eos> Please...<eos> Bind his wrists.<eos> Bind his wrists.<eos> Don't let your brother control you.
Please...<eos> Bind his wrists.<eos> Bind his wrists.<eos> Don't let your brother control you.<eos> I raised you to be better.
You're welcome.<eos> It's just been real hard lately, you know?<eos> I know.<eos> Hasn't been the same since you left.<eos> So, what, he's waiting for you now?
Don't you ever touch me again.<eos> Have a seat, sir.<eos> John.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Did he say anything else to you?
John.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Did he say anything else to you?<eos> Anything I should know before going in?<eos> Um... just what I told you over the phone.
The reason we pray?<eos> Family and peace.<eos> That is what we seek.<eos> Anything else is a twisted perversion.<eos> Don't let your brother lead you down the wrong path.
I have to go.<eos> Wait, stop.<eos> Amira...<eos> Amira.<eos> He said something to you, didn't he?
'Cause that's what he does.<eos> You made the right choice.<eos> You did.<eos> Why are you telling me this?<eos> 'Cause the next time they come up here could be the last time I see you.
Of course it is.<eos> It's disgusting.<eos> But if you think this will make Eric do what you want, you're wrong.<eos> Oh, but he will, though.<eos> He will, because he loves you.
They'll back you up.<eos> I'm asking you... to find another way.<eos> I don't want to lose you.<eos> Jadalla just sent the GPS coordinates.<eos> When CTU finds you, you better tell them to stay away.
Your father wasn't responding to conventional interrogation.<eos> We needed to try something else.<eos> Something else?<eos> We need to finish this conversation in person.<eos> I'll have CTU bring you over.
All right?<eos> Nicole, I love you.<eos> I always have.<eos> Always will.<eos> Andy... remember, be sure Jadalla believes I'm forcing you to do this.
We need to call CTU.<eos> Hell no.<eos> Nah.<eos> Hey... look...<eos> Eric brought you to me because those people cannot be trusted.
I need to talk to you.<eos> - I want to see my father.<eos> - Listen to me, Henry's all right.<eos> You can see him, but I want you to hear me out first.<eos> Hear you out?
I got no clue how ugly it's gonna get, but I'm-a go after Eric<eos> - 'cause I love him.<eos> I'm not just gonna stand here while you go off and save my husband.<eos> Eric gave himself up to save you.<eos> You go back in there and something happens to you, his sacrifice means nothing.
_<eos> Got it.<eos> Naseri.<eos> Be quiet.<eos> Think I wouldn't recognize you after what you did?
Got it.<eos> Naseri.<eos> Be quiet.<eos> Think I wouldn't recognize you after what you did?<eos> Why is he calling you Naseri?
You're a psychopath, Jadalla, just like your father.<eos> Both of you are sad, little men, twisting your faith into an excuse for violence.<eos> You liked that, didn't you?<eos> You loved it.<eos> It really gets you off, huh?
When there wasn't anything you wouldn't do for each other.<eos> Let's give these bitches some payback.<eos> Naseri.<eos> Be quiet.<eos> You think I wouldn't recognize you after what you did?
That's good news.<eos> But where's Eric?<eos> Eric had some business to take care of.<eos> He'll call you as soon as he can.<eos> Is that what he told you to say?
And I think Naseri is watching her on some kind of a Web camera.<eos> So, Naseri's using her as leverage.<eos> Yeah, but she can't tell us anything until we defuse the vest.<eos> I might be able to create a video loop.<eos> Like what Andy did for you when you broke into the police station.
Listen to me.<eos> No one's gonna die.<eos> My name is Eric Carter.<eos> I'm working with the Counter Terrorism Unit.<eos> I need you to tell me why they're threatening you, okay?
Are you here?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We made good time.<eos> I'm down here at security.<eos> I told them to bring you to me.
Carter?<eos> Carter?<eos> Carter?<eos> We're good.<eos> Jennifer, I need to know why they did this to you.
He killed the asset's family.<eos> Carter found them.<eos> Naseri.<eos> Be quiet.<eos> You think I wouldn't recognize you after what you did?
All right, CTU agents are on their way.<eos> Just make sure Luis doesn't go anywhere.<eos> Rebecca... I'm sorry.<eos> You look like a ghost.<eos> I told you, give John some time.
And you're a liar.<eos> I wonder if you really don't know what I'm talking about.<eos> I'd tell you to ask her, but you're never gonna see her again.<eos> What is it?<eos> If I'd been at your side from the beginning, maybe this wouldn't have happened to you.
What is it?<eos> If I'd been at your side from the beginning, maybe this wouldn't have happened to you.<eos> It has happened for a reason.<eos> When I left for Europe, I... I thought I was joining a better world.<eos> When I heard the Americans had murdered you, I... I couldn't rationalize their hypocrisy anymore.
Cover him.<eos> Andy,<eos> Simms is secure.<eos> I'm logging in to the terminal now.<eos> Go to the I.P. address I gave you.
Ara.<eos> That's a beautiful name.<eos> My name is Eric, and I'm here to help you.<eos> Help?<eos> What these people did to you is wrong.
I'm scared.<eos> It's okay. All right?<eos> It's okay.<eos> _<eos> I'm not gonna let anything happen to you. Okay?
Hey!<eos> Inside the house, we only want the girl.<eos> Just send her out and then we're done.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I'm not gonna let anything happen to you.
We've sent Eric Carter there to protect her.<eos> Naseri thinks she's dead, which means if he finds out that she's alive, there might be a chance that he would trade her for Rebecca.<eos> But that won't happen, Tony, unless you release Carter and that girl.<eos> Simms told me they weren't connected.<eos> Well, he lied to you.
Naseri?<eos> !<eos> She's safe.<eos> Start walking.<eos> When I tell you, hit the ground.
Because I have it, too.<eos> We all do.<eos> The people who do this work it's a gift.<eos> Oh, and it's a curse.<eos> And it'll eat you alive if you don't deal with it.
The people who do this work it's a gift.<eos> Oh, and it's a curse.<eos> And it'll eat you alive if you don't deal with it.<eos> "Deal with it"?<eos> Go where it leads you.
I'm your father.<eos> I know who you are.<eos> I'm trying to understand... how this... happened.<eos> How... how I let this happen.<eos> I told myself I was protecting you, but now I...
That's one way to get rid of your boat.<eos> Hey, drive him to school today?<eos> I was planning on it.<eos> Love you.<eos> Love you too.
He chained those he felt most likely to revolt over the offense.<eos> Though, I imagine they know this.<eos> With what conditions?<eos> Two of them.<eos> They respect you, so they'll listen to you.
You've cast your lot with him.<eos> What does it matter to you?<eos> Before this war began, before everyone's roles changed, your father mistrusted Flint as much as anyone in Nassau did.<eos> I assume you were in some contact with him all that time.<eos> I'm surprised that his feelings didn't influence you.
You were my sister.<eos> There is very little that I remember from when I was young, but I remember this.<eos> You were older.<eos> You were beautiful.<eos> I revered you.
I revered you.<eos> When you were told that my mother and I were dead, I have to believe that it affected you.<eos> You had just lost your mother.<eos> But if things were as I remember, my mother and I were your family, too.<eos> And yet, through all the years thereafter that my father cared for you... counseled you, labored for you... he never told you that we were alive.
I came to find Eleanor.<eos> "I betrayed you, Jack.<eos> "Tried to trade your life for my own personal gain.<eos> "Lied to Anne to her face about it.<eos> "Please, Jack. Beg of you. "Is there any way you can forgive me?"
If?<eos> A thousand Spanish fighters are more than three times our number could withstand.<eos> What can we do but retreat?<eos> We're not leaving.<eos> If it's Madi that concerns you, we could send someone out to find her.
I've found myself thinking about it.<eos> Of walking away from Nassau, from England, from civilization.<eos> One can be happy that way, can't they?<eos> A life of isolation and uncertainty as long as it is lived with someone you love...<eos> And who loves you back.
The revolution you promised has begun.<eos> - Where's Madi?<eos> - I need you to know that I did everything I could to keep her safe.<eos> It wasn't your fault.<eos> I wasn't able to say good-bye to her... so I don't know what she would've wanted me to say to you right now... if anything at all.
Then leave.<eos> But what's happening here is going to happen.<eos> This war is going to begin.<eos> This camp is going to fight it with or without you.<eos> They may call you a king, but only in the kingdom that is no more.
She listened.<eos> She told me she ain't got no apology... for what she'd done.<eos> I know.<eos> Part of me wanted to lash out.<eos> Betrayed you.
It will happen with Flint and Silver.<eos> This plan will work.<eos> You want the exchange of the money to happen off this island, somewhere no one need know of it.<eos> There it is.<eos> You'll lead them there and they will follow you.
Yesterday, he had nothing.<eos> He was shouting at the rain.<eos> Now you've given him all he needs to kill this war dead.<eos> My God.<eos> The number of times I have followed you blindly, backed you with the men blindly, put men in the fucking ground... Good men, friends... because you said, "I know the way."
Jack went to hunt Captain Flint.<eos> Chances are good you've seen the last of him.<eos> You killed a friend of mine.<eos> Her name was Charlotte... and you did it for reasons that had nothing to do with her.<eos> There were men I knew that would've killed you for me.
There were men I knew that would've killed you for me.<eos> I wanted to ask them.<eos> Had the money.<eos> But Max refused.<eos> I couldn't tell then if it was because she was afraid of you.
In terms of your obligations to him, there are plenty of ways for a man like that to retain satisfaction in a place like Nassau with little or no participation from you.<eos> You'd likely retain as much freedom in that regard as you desired.<eos> To rise from where you began to where you now stand, I cannot imagine the road you've traveled.<eos> The humiliations and the sacrifices and the defeats... and the illusions maintained at so great a cost to your sense of self.<eos> But that road has led you to me.
I tried to tell him.<eos> We fight, only two outcomes I can see... I die or you die.<eos> Either way, he's gonna take me to blame for it.<eos> That's how far you've burrowed into his head.<eos> He won't put you out of it until he sees you for what you are.
- Accept the treaty...<eos> - I will consider no treaty of yours.<eos> And John Silver lives.<eos> Refuse... and he dies... along with the rest of the men who followed him here.<eos> And from what I understand, he is the one who matters most to you.
James said he saw him clutch for his chest.<eos> Then... he just dropped.<eos> Should we...?<eos> His heart gave out.<eos> So, you asked him to recount for you what he knew days ago, yes?
I know you cannot see why this must be.<eos> But it must be.<eos> And every moment we waste is a moment we could be working to retrieve her.<eos> That's all this has ever been, isn't it?<eos> A partnership only insofar as it enables you to do whatever it is that matters to you in any given moment.
But it must be.<eos> And every moment we waste is a moment we could be working to retrieve her.<eos> That's all this has ever been, isn't it?<eos> A partnership only insofar as it enables you to do whatever it is that matters to you in any given moment.<eos> And right now it matters far less to you whether she lives or dies than it happens your way, on your terms.
Quickly!<eos> Careful.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Thank you.<eos> When they took you... I saw the look I used to see in the eyes of my husband.
Quickly!<eos> Careful.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Thank you.<eos> When they took you... I saw the look I used to see in the eyes of my husband.
- And Internet viral sensation.<eos> Though, I'll be honest, that speech of yours sounded suspiciously like Zakia herself.<eos> Yeah, come on, Van Damn.<eos> Your secret is safe with us.<eos> Zakia invented you, didn't she?
- Could you let her know that...<eos> No, never mind.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Prison was good for you.
- Hey, you promised no social media.<eos> But it's evidence. It's evidence, Hernando.<eos> It proves no one wants anything to do with me.<eos> Well, that is not true.<eos> Somebody wants you and here's the proof.
Food, some clothes, money.<eos> I do not know how to thank you.<eos> Nothing I have done in my life exceeds the honor to have been your teacher.<eos> Sometimes, I find her staring at the gate.<eos> I know she's waiting for you.
Yes, I loved a woman.<eos> It's true.<eos> I've also loved men.<eos> I fall in love with the person, not their genitals.<eos> Which may sound weird to you.
I fall in love with the person, not their genitals.<eos> Which may sound weird to you.<eos> No.<eos> Not at all.<eos> Look, I'm not someone who usually talks like a greeting card, but... lately, I've come to see that luck is something that reminds you how beautiful the world can be.
No.<eos> Not at all.<eos> Look, I'm not someone who usually talks like a greeting card, but... lately, I've come to see that luck is something that reminds you how beautiful the world can be.<eos> Which is the part where I may need some courage.<eos> I've not felt so lucky since I met you.
Last night was a dream come true.<eos> See you later.<eos> So they came to my house, they talked to me about it, and they left.<eos> Wait, you're telling me the DRP actually came to your door<eos> - and asked you to run on their ticket? - Yeah.
I'm one of your biggest fans!<eos> - Thank you very much.<eos> - Oh, where...<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> - I love you so much!
But be careful, Van Damn, people are noticing.<eos> Well, uh...<eos> Hello, Mom.<eos> Hello, son.<eos> I see the dinner I prepared for you is still there.
Listen, the hardest part is getting the samples without a leash around my neck.<eos> But lucky you seem to already have yours, the latest ones with less side effects.<eos> Seems like somebody might have a friend at BPO.<eos> Wait.<eos> Blockers aren't gonna keep you safe forever, Riley Blue.
Just the things that matter.<eos> These are the last year reports from the controller general.<eos> Yeah, you can just put them there.<eos> - Thank you. - You're welcome.<eos> About last night... I... needed you and you were there for me.
Lila, why are you still talking to him?<eos> I know what I'm doing.<eos> You said we needed each other, but as soon as I ask you for something, you walk away.<eos> Be smart.<eos> - How long has he been after you?
- And Internet viral sensation.<eos> Though, I'll be honest, that speech of yours sounded suspiciously like Zakia herself.<eos> Yeah, come on, Van Damn.<eos> Your secret is safe with us.<eos> Zakia invented you, didn't she?
- Could you let her know that...<eos> No, never mind.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Prison was good for you.

He doesn't need security.<eos> Van Damn is security.<eos> It's, as he said, a precaution.<eos> Why?<eos> Because if anything should ever happen to you, no one will ever be brave enough to stand up to Mandiba again.
I lost my agent.<eos> I lost my Instagram followers, my Twitter followers.<eos> - I've lost...<eos> - Shut up!<eos> You have a man who loves you.
- I've lost...<eos> - Shut up!<eos> You have a man who loves you.<eos> And you have a friend who was willing to give up her life for you.<eos> And you have a mother who accepts you.
Why do you think she would be listed as a missing person?<eos> We know she was scared.<eos> We know she went through a lot of trouble to meet with you.<eos> - Which means that...<eos> - Whoever's after you is probably after her.
Lito!<eos> Burt Lancaster had this... power.<eos> Oh, I get that.<eos> They all wanted to be her.<eos> Did you want Burt to kiss and drip on you, too?
I know you're angry... but this is how a girl like me tells a boy like you that she has a crush on you.<eos> And instead of laying in bed, wishing she was going out with you and not her current boyfriend... she has decided to do something about it.<eos> Far enough.<eos> So we meet again, eh, Van Damn?<eos> So, tell me, did that pretty girl of yours turn you on to politics?
So we meet again, eh, Van Damn?<eos> So, tell me, did that pretty girl of yours turn you on to politics?<eos> Or you are Silas' bitch now?<eos> Why do you care?<eos> Just never figured you for doing something as stupid as politics.
I look terrible.<eos> I hate heels.<eos> I'm already klutzy enough.<eos> You look great.<eos> You're just feeling a little anxious because Teagan asked you to do a toast.
[laughs] He doesn't need security.<eos> Van Damn is security.<eos> It's, as he said, a precaution.<eos> Why?<eos> Because if anything should ever happen to you, no one will ever be brave enough to stand up to Mandiba again.

How sad to let your father die alone like that.<eos> Just stay the fuck away from me.<eos> Or what?<eos> I know things were difficult between you and your father.<eos> Maybe... Maybe you didn't go to your father because, in the end, he wasn't that important to you.
Hey, man, look at you.<eos> Van Damn!<eos> Mom?<eos> Oh, my son.<eos> If your father could see you now.
- Just like them?<eos> They do.<eos> - You'll be fine, son.<eos> - How do you know that?<eos> Because your whole life, every really good day, and every truly bad one, has been preparing you for this moment.
You were amazing.<eos> I want to grow up so I can vote for you.<eos> After what happened... I don't think anyone's going to vote for me.<eos> I wouldn't be so sure, Capheus.<eos> People heard you out there.

Where are you pulling me to?<eos> I'll break my legs!<eos> - Surprise!<eos> - Are you nuts?<eos> They will lock you up for that.
You're so dressed up.<eos> What did you expect?<eos> It's the capital city after all.<eos> You need to come more often.<eos> I almost started to forget you.
- You have to go back home.<eos> - My home is here!<eos> You can't stay here, honey!<eos> - Why?<eos> - Aunt Wanda loves you so much
You sit there and you try to claim moral high ground.<eos> Oh, oh, oh, oh. I claim it?<eos> While you go on working at a criminal organization, and you can't even fucking admit it to yourself.<eos> I tell you about my issues with Danzig, and then there's a fucking investigation underway!<eos> I didn't sell you out.
Fire systems have automatic cutoffs.<eos> We weren't even allowed in to get our stuff.<eos> I know what you know.<eos> I heard Axe went kind of nuts.<eos> - Who the fuck asked you?
Well, well, well.<eos> Three young apprentices celebrating the departure of a colleague.<eos> Sure. But don't they also want to put a foot in his ass and take his spot?<eos> Hmm? Oh, come on.<eos> You know Head of Crim is the hyperloop that propels you into whatever job you want next.
Problem is, the trade's by appointment.<eos> No broker will take all five million and guarantee my price, so I've got five brokers selling a million each, and they don't know about each other.<eos> Are you sure about the way you're unloading that?<eos> It's kind of shady and not very efficient.<eos> They'll find out and ding you later.
Please?<eos> Always a lovely word to hear, but I'm not some deputy anymore.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Uh, I get that and respect it.<eos> But we both know why you're not a deputy anymore, so I am asking you to do this one for me.
I'm logging you on to Raya.<eos> - How?<eos> - I'm a member, so I vouch.<eos> You need two reccos.<eos> I got Michael Che to second you.
I am just beginning to remember what that feels like.<eos> And I'm not gonna let you ruin one of the first free nights I've had in years.<eos> I always knew I'd end up snared by Axelrod's money.<eos> It's poison.<eos> And you don't even need to ingest it for it to kill you.
Melissa...<eos> It's all right, Melissa.<eos> We understand.<eos> I hope you die and she becomes president.<eos> What did the girl say to you?
Out there, right now, as we speak.<eos> Well, I'm a big fan of American law enforcement.<eos> They'll find him soon enough. We can't just let Francis Underwood turn us into a nation that's always looking over their shoulder.<eos> If you can get yourself onto that committee, I got a feeling the Chair will give you all the time you need.<eos> My driver will take you back to your car.
Did you see her first?<eos> What did you see?<eos> Or did she see you first?<eos> Yeah, that's it, isn't it?<eos> She saw you.
Good news is the guy's an old scumbag.<eos> Thing is, we don't know yet what kind of cell phone video we might be dealing with.<eos> So I want you to listen to your good friend, Bo.<eos> You sustained multiple blows to the head during the altercation. Okay?<eos> Your PBA rep advises you not to make any statements till we can confirm your cognitive functions were operating normally.
Time to go.<eos> Come on. Kids'll be up soon.<eos> I don't want them to be confused.<eos> I don't want them to be confused, either.<eos> So you wouldn't want them to wake up and find you here when they know you don't live here anymore.
Okay, okay, okay.<eos> Listen.<eos> We got shitfaced, right?<eos> We decided to crash at my place, and we wake up with these, like... these Dean Martin hangovers.<eos> They're expecting you at the office today, right?
It turns into a pumpkin at 4:30 or 5:00.<eos> The hardware's an Excelsior 500 series.<eos> There's ten grand in it for you.<eos> On top of whatever my cut from the Turk turns out to be?<eos> I told you, it has nothing to do with that.
Charlie's the reason I came in.<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> I hesitated, I'm not gonna lie.<eos> Ended up deciding, if she doesn't blame you, hard to see how I can.
- Otto: What the hell?<eos> - What?<eos> Oh, holy shit.<eos> Holy fuckin' shit.<eos> The man tells me to bring you, I bring you.
Like when your ashes need hauling?<eos> Man, she's 75 years old.<eos> She looks in on Hushpuppy when I gotta be out late.<eos> Anyway, she told me about your little rooftop phone call you made yesterday after you Houdini'd out of my zip ties.<eos> She told you, you told Vince.
Couldn't be more than 17 years old.<eos> The kind of kid who would smile when he got nervous, you know?<eos> Even when you're smacking him around, he'd smile.<eos> It's the damndest thing.<eos> And he'd look up at you with these big, brown Bambi eyes.
Hey, you want a tarot card reading?<eos> Maybe I can tell you how long you an Paul will be together.<eos> All right, trouble-maker.<eos> Hope this will do. So, read any good books lately?<eos> Ha ha. That gets you every time, doesn't it?
If I'm downstairs, how am I going to screw your brains out?<eos> Oh, wow. Although I have my ways.<eos> Good night, Paul.<eos> You're actually kicking me out?<eos> Exactly what did Karen say to you?
No, thanks.<eos> Jennifer, I'm so sorry about last night.<eos> You were right.<eos> I was way out of line.<eos> I promise to make it up to you...
Leave!<eos> Take your husband and get out!<eos> It'll try to seduce you, trick you with pleasure, make you want more.<eos> It feeds off human desires.<eos> But, if you're not careful, it will literally eat you alive.
Did not disappear, like they say.<eos> She was swallowed up by that house.<eos> She died saving my life...<eos> Trying to trap the evil that was summoned decades earlier.<eos> Get out, before it takes you, too!
And that people have died here, and that we should move, now!<eos> - That's ridiculous.<eos> - Is it?<eos> You've been acting like an asshole ever since we moved in.<eos> Maybe this house has infected you.
I see.<eos> Did she go and ruin my surprise?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Let me guess.<eos> She probably told you that she never mentioned dawn black to me by name.
She probably told you that she never mentioned dawn black to me by name.<eos> And that she didn't know anything about the history of this house, or... Maggie black's tampering with the occult, or the incubus.<eos> As a matter of fact, that's exactly what she said.<eos> Now you're wondering how I knew all those things.<eos> Was there any truth to what that burnt up bitch told you this afternoon.
Paul.<eos> I bet you really want to know what's inside that black room in the basement, don't you?<eos> Paul, you're starting to scare me.<eos> Well then, come downstairs and see what I've been working on for the past two and half years.<eos> I don't understand what's gotten into you.
Yeah, me too.<eos> Well, maybe tonight we can do something about it, now that everything's back to normal.<eos> I meant to tell you, we may have a problem.<eos> Not everything's back to normal.<eos> It did that to you?
There's a Russian arriving at Lovelace College tomorrow for the chess tournament.<eos> It's Special Branch's bailiwick, but Division want the local force represented.<eos> You've some Russian, I believe, from your time in Signals.<eos> The barest smattering, sir.<eos> That still puts you ahead of the rest of us.
Just something I came across at Cowley Baths last night.<eos> I didn't know your enthusiasms ran to chess.<eos> They don't, usually.<eos> I'm here in an official capacity.<eos> Not seen much of you since the Wessex raid.
Would you...?<eos> Would you like me to change the music?<eos> I gather opera's more your bag.<eos> Look, don't think too badly of her.<eos> Dorothea holds you in some regard.
- Leave Oxford?<eos> - Why not?<eos> Fresh start.<eos> You've no family local.<eos> As I understand it, there's nothing to keep you here.
It's not Gibbs.<eos> You think Dr Castle is the Leighton-Asbury boy?<eos> After his sister killed herself, he went to his grandparents in Scotland.<eos> - Their name was King.<eos> - How does that get you to Castle?
I remember you, of course.<eos> The disgusting insinuations you made after the inquest.<eos> - I wrote the truth.<eos> - I loved my sister.<eos> Well, she didn't love you.
- Hope it doesn't come to that.<eos> - Morning.<eos> - Morning.<eos> Hey.<eos> Oh. Minnie, I love you too, sweetheart.
Thirsty.<eos> Welcome home.<eos> I'm just barely open.<eos> Sorry, I was hoping for some music.<eos> God, I haven't seen you in an age.
Welcome home.<eos> I'm just barely open.<eos> Sorry, I was hoping for some music.<eos> God, I haven't seen you in an age.<eos> What brings you back to the west?
I signed up when I was 19.<eos> Same as all the other hotheads.<eos> Thought I'd go whup ass, bring justice to a place that needed it, you know?<eos> I do. I married one of those hotheads.<eos> How was it for you?
Did you hear something?<eos> The sound of you fucking up.<eos> I did the right thing.<eos> Oh, you're so sure about that, huh?<eos> What, your vast PR experience led you to that conclusion?
I'm tired.<eos> Don't matter if you're tired.<eos> Whoa, I said I'm tired.<eos> I'm gonna rest for a bit, and then I'll go get shit done, or whatever.<eos> Sounds good to you?
I'm telling the real story, 'cause you sure the hell didn't.<eos> Where the fuck the cameras go?<eos> They left to go home, which is what I'm gonna do.<eos> - So, excuse me.<eos> - Oh, oh, wait. Excuse you?
I know.<eos> I know, and that was wrong, but I was trying to prevent one tragedy from becoming two.<eos> Taystee, what's your endgame here?<eos> How long do you think you can keep us?<eos> They're gonna notice you're missing during count. They're gonna come looking for you.
I got a big operation.<eos> I need to concentrate.<eos> - I just wanted...<eos> - I can't hear you.<eos> I love you too.
There!<eos> - There.<eos> - I see it.<eos> Here we go This is fun.<eos> Rory, you have to move, it's gonna hit you.
You can do that but make sure to protect the glove.<eos> - Shit.<eos> - She gripping the glass.<eos> Motherfucker.<eos> How hard is he holding on to you?
Kat?<eos> No comments.<eos> I have got to jump.<eos> Tether is getting out of the channel.<eos> She is not gonna tell you, that's her heart is beating out of her chest
We fly it into deep space.<eos> With.. With Calvin.<eos> Yes.<eos> Meanwhile, you get into the boat B. You press the button.<eos> If there are no complications, Then it takes you back home.
You're always drunk.<eos> Well, I saw you with Townsend.<eos> We were just talking.<eos> You were in each other's arms.<eos> He's been after you ever since he met you.
I can write anywhere.<eos> I love you best of all.<eos> I really need a bath and a nap.<eos> Ah, well... we could break a window.<eos> Oh, if you think my daddy hates you now...
Maybe, uh, I should lower this a notch or two.<eos> Latin?<eos> You wanna take Latin?<eos> I like Latin.<eos> Liam, who told you to take Latin?
Get behind me.<eos> Wait, that's a...<eos> Hellhound.<eos> - Run!<eos> - Wait, I'm not leaving you!
Okay.<eos> Shit.<eos> Hey, everything okay?<eos> I'm going back to the Torrent.<eos> You think that guy did something to you 'cause you were a raging douche?
So how do you feel now?<eos> We're not getting back together.<eos> Okay.<eos> I've been wondering something.<eos> Why didn't Reynard kill you with your friends?
I can show you how.<eos> No, thank you.<eos> Do let me know if you change your mind.<eos> Eliot!<eos> The crown suits you, of course.
Look, it's not a parking lot.<eos> Just don't let people park in front of our house, okay?<eos> -Yes, sir.<eos> -Why's the bed all messed up?<eos> - When I was trying this on, maybe I got a little too excited thinking about what I was gonna do to you later.
Thank you, Mr. schaefer.<eos> -Thanks.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> - I thought we were dead.<eos> - What's wrong with you?
- Yeah.<eos> Be careful your cover doesn't get blown on the first day.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Hey, yeah.<eos> And if she sees you, just say you're with Google maps.
-It's fine.<eos> - You know, I got this really good burger place down the street, if you want to go get a bite?<eos> -Sorry, I can't.<eos> I just have a really busy day ahead of me, and I need to sleep some more.<eos> I'll see you tomorrow?
- The problem-solver guy.<eos> I need his number.<eos> -The sky is blue.<eos> -But the clouds are gray.<eos> - Look, I don't know what Luke told you.
I got hired to do a job, no?<eos> It's not my fault. You called it off at the last minute.<eos> - Too late.<eos> They have a witness putting you at the house.<eos> The cops are looking for you as we speak.
The police...?<eos> What are you doing in the police station?<eos> -I can't really tell you now.<eos> But can you please just...<eos> I know there's a detective who's gonna call you any minute.
-Fuck!<eos> Fuck!<eos> One big fucking spiral with you, isn't it?<eos> First you wanna kill Kim, and now you shoot this fucking guy.<eos> What's wrong with you?
All right?<eos> - Let's go to bed.<eos> - -Okay.<eos> - I love you.<eos> - I love you too.
Isabel, Isabel!<eos> What happened, sir?<eos> Who's Conte?<eos> Sorry, Luis.<eos> What happened to you?
Are you scared of the girl? '<eos> If I would deny it, I'd be lying.<eos> But to be honest, I am a little..<eos> Since it is the first time I am doing this, I feel, that's why..<eos> 'Rohan, I hope someone is accompanying you.'
some darkness in life.<eos> I have always been alone but for the first time, I felt lonely today.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> - Trying to picture your face.<eos> I have pictured you already, without even touching you.
"Yet, if I fulfil the dreams, we will then be certain"<eos> "if I am capable of your love or not."<eos> "I am capable of your love or not."<eos> "I will write your name on sand by the waters."<eos> "I will then call out you!
What is it?<eos> You will need these..<eos> This is protection for you.<eos> How can you say that in front of everyone?<eos> What's wrong with you?
They never compliment their wives in front of them.<eos> This is what my wife Jaya complains about too.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you, Mr. Amit.<eos> May God bless you with a happy married life.
Pay more attention on your duty than my calls.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> - Take her to the hospital for the medical.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Listen, Mr. Chaube has sent a car for you.
The 24 hours following the molestation are the most critical for evidence.<eos> You have showed up after 30 hours, that too, drenched.<eos> All evidence seems to have been washed away.<eos> What!<eos> They kidnapped you and locked you up?
You have showed up after 30 hours, that too, drenched.<eos> All evidence seems to have been washed away.<eos> What!<eos> They kidnapped you and locked you up?<eos> And then left you in the sea?
Mr. Chaube, I need to talk to you.<eos> Hey!<eos> - Mr. Chaube!<eos> Get out.<eos> I asked you to leave!
I will send you to Pune to sister, do you get it?<eos> Yes.<eos> I get it.<eos> See you.<eos> Do you think, he'll listen to you?
Hey!<eos> This is amazing!<eos> You have a barbecue?<eos> Bethie, you're missing it.<eos> Don't let your mum see you.
It's late!<eos> Come on, I'll take you in five minutes.<eos> It's a beautiful night.<eos> Tuesday she's at my mum's, don't forget.<eos> Call you in the morning.
Oh God!<eos> Oh, hey!<eos> Hey, my little angel.<eos> Hey, are you OK?<eos> What did they do to you?
Marteen McGuire, new patient, she came in last night?<eos> Are you family?<eos> Sir, are you family?<eos> My favourite is Duffy Duck.<eos> Mum needs you inside.
It's OK.<eos> Hey. Spend it fast.<eos> Cos I'm gonna do you, just like I did Teena.<eos> What?<eos> Thought I didn't make you, Case?
- Narrated by Ellen Page?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I'm familiar.<eos> Good, right? Can I tell you something?<eos> I don't know if I would've been so keen on inviting you if you didn't have such a lovely British accent.
Come on.<eos> I'm sorry. Grazie mille.<eos> I'm not gonna say "prego mille."<eos> What's up?<eos> What's wrong with you?
I'm here.<eos> I win.<eos> I'm your best friend.<eos> I'm the best at being your friend.<eos> I love you the most.
That's not gonna happen.<eos> And I'm still fucking bleeding.<eos> From my vagina.<eos> No one understands!<eos> You think no one understands you?
- Yeah, well, maybe she thought<eos> - you'd act like a fucking grown-up.<eos> - What?<eos> You wanna act like this whole thing was an accident?<eos> Like it happened to you? That's fine, Hannah.
This is it, honey, and this is forever.<eos> Stop following me!<eos> And why are you judging me and putting words in my mouth?<eos> Why are you judging me?<eos> Because you just said your baby hates you, and that is the most moronic thing I have ever heard.
Stop following me!<eos> And why are you judging me and putting words in my mouth?<eos> Why are you judging me?<eos> Because you just said your baby hates you, and that is the most moronic thing I have ever heard.<eos> He doesn't hate you.
The... ah...<eos> - Hah! - I don't understand, Mom.<eos> You didn't say it was gonna be this hard.<eos> Oh, have I made this look easy to you?<eos> No. Have the last few years looked easy to you?
- Hah! - I don't understand, Mom.<eos> You didn't say it was gonna be this hard.<eos> Oh, have I made this look easy to you?<eos> No. Have the last few years looked easy to you?<eos> Maybe they would have if you'd chosen a husband who wasn't gay and who actually loved you.
I have no idea when she'll be back.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Motherhood seems to have had such an effect on her.<eos> Yeah, I don't even know why we have that here.<eos> Sorry I walked in on you beating off.
Why?<eos> It's just not my time.<eos> This is important.<eos> Hannah's my best friend.<eos> Has it ever occurred to you that the best thing for you and your friendship would be if you were happy, too?
That's her job in the world.<eos> She has a million trillion things she'd rather be doing.<eos> Things she might want to experience.<eos> Life things she hasn't enjoyed yet.<eos> But she stays and tells you to do your homework 'cause it's what's fucking good for you.
But she stays and tells you to do your homework 'cause it's what's fucking good for you.<eos> What do you think your mom's gonna do when you get home?<eos> I don't know. Hug me, I guess?<eos> Exactly!<eos> 'Cause she loves you more than anything else in the world, and she knows you're the most important thing even if it means being emotionally abused by a brat day in and day out, okay?
No, you psycho lady!<eos> Oh, you run, you little harlot.<eos> Run as fast as you can, okay?<eos> But life is gonna chase you, it's gonna chase after you with problems you can't even imagine.<eos> And I'd be chasing you, too, if my vagina wasn't so busted from having a baby.
Maybe after the European residency?<eos> But, you know, I also don't wanna feel like you're not getting your time.<eos> Yeah, go grab your calendar.<eos> No, I asked you, Mayaan.<eos> I 100% asked you, because I always goddamn ask you.
I'm talking about the part where you're a very fucking famous writer and she's working really hard to have just a little bit of what you get every day.<eos> So, you invite her back to your hotel room.<eos> What's she supposed to say?<eos> No?<eos> - Uh... - She admires you.
He looks at me in the middle of this fuckin' party like he's a judge and he goes,<eos> "That's a very serious accusation, Hannah." And he walked away.<eos> And there I am, and I'm just 11 again, and I'm just getting my fuckin' neck rubbed.<eos> Because that stuff never goes away.<eos> Yeah, I'm sorry that happened to you.
Yeah, but look at me.<eos> I'm smart.<eos> And amazing.<eos> And now I have a story.<eos> Can I read something to you?
Like, is this fiction?<eos> I did change the names, but this is what I wrote about Denise before she published her fucking Tumblr article, before a website called The Awl called me "Throat-Piercer."<eos> This is what I wrote about Denise before she told the world that I was a menace and a sleaze and a fraud.<eos> She doesn't think you're a fraud.<eos> She clearly respects you a lot.
- Pfft, maybe.<eos> And a lot of people know some stuff about you.<eos> Some stuff.<eos> I mean, they'll think they'll know everything, but they won't.<eos> - Like what happened to you.
I have no idea if that's true. Can't find any proof on the Internet, but, God, if it is, fuck, that's so good.<eos> Why don't you keep the Roth?<eos> - Seriously?<eos> - Yeah, seriously.<eos> I like how happy it makes you.
- Hannah?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Would you lie down with me for a moment?<eos> Just a moment.<eos> And I'd encourage you to keep your clothes on to delineate any... any boundaries that feel right to you.
I just wanna feel close to someone in a way that I haven't in a long time.<eos> If you please.<eos> Your bed smells like snacks.<eos> I live alone, lady.<eos> I'm sorry I wrote something about you that, um, upset you so much without considering all the facts.
Um, so, when I finally got to New York and I knew that I wanted to support myself on my own so I could write, well, I thought that was gonna mean, you know, serving cheesecake in Junior's or temping in the Bronx.<eos> And it turned out it meant part-time sex work in an oddly clinical townhouse in midtown.<eos> And you know something?<eos> That was the happiest I've ever been.<eos> But I don't understand because you came to New York because you wanted to write, so I don't really get, like, how, like, servicing other people would give you what you wanted.
So, then I'll just put it out there... is being a writer and being a woman at the same time, is it as hard as it seems or...?<eos> Harder.<eos> I'm not scared.<eos> As long as I can keep my mother alive, I'm not scared.<eos> You mean tell me mission does not scare you?
- Good.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> But couldn't we just, like, um... just get dinner sometimes?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I feel like I haven't seen you in weeks.
and I don't wanna insult you... but that was fucked up what you just did right there.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - All right.<eos> It's not an insult.<eos> Nobody's blaming you.
I have a lot of questions.<eos> Your people were very good at keeping me in the dark.<eos> Well, these people are in the dark too.<eos> So a physicist who can fly.<eos> It's no wonder NASA poached you from the Air Force.
We should keep moving.<eos> Look at what they've done.<eos> - And what about what you did, Michael?<eos> - We raided the lab.<eos> What happened to you?
- Parallel universes?<eos> - An echo universe.<eos> And this here is where you come in.<eos> This is the gate.<eos> It sends you into the echo a safe distance from the tower.
"Redivider." What does it mean?<eos> I don't know.<eos> They didn't brief me on Redivider.<eos> What about shit like this, man?<eos> They never briefed you about trains falling out of the fucking sky?
- You have been identified.<eos> Lie on the ground and place your hands over your head.<eos> Hey!<eos> It's me!<eos> What the fuck is wrong with you?
Critical failure protocol! You're going in!<eos> Will!<eos> I guess that resignation will have to wait.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - Where are they taking you?
Fuck you.<eos> We need your help, Will.<eos> - There is still time.<eos> - Time for what?<eos> You think I'd actually help you?
With some boring, 27-year-old single mom.<eos> Well, I don't have to be boring.<eos> I could be a cool single mom, you know, like Lorelai Gilmore.<eos> Elijah, I don't know what to say.<eos> I always told you I wanted to be a mother someday.
- Oh, really?<eos> You need help, and you just thought I would help you raise your... your fatherless baby?<eos> You don't think I have plans?<eos> What's your plan, to, like, smoke salvia at 10:00 AM every day?<eos> - Fuck you.
It's not a big commitment.<eos> It's just under 47 minutes.<eos> I'm avoiding it 'cause I'd literally rather do anything else.<eos> Like I would prefer to eat my own arm.<eos> But maybe your resistance is telling you that you actually need to be watching it.
I did not sign up for all of this.<eos> Well, you signed a contract with a record label and then you opted to do a tristate tour, so I don't really know what you thought you were signing up for.<eos> Desi?<eos> Desi.<eos> What the fuck is wrong with you?
I was just acting like one.<eos> Before that, I was just acting like being an actor.<eos> Before that, I was just acting like being a big game photographer.<eos> I'm always acting like I'm something, but now I'm, like... done.<eos> What happened to you?
What happened to you?<eos> So gorgeous.<eos> You've gotta get down here and see his biceps.<eos> It's unbelievable.<eos> What's wrong with you?
I think it's about time to... yeah, let's go.<eos> - You're not wearing a watch.<eos> - Well, I know what time it is.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> I convinced Sharva to book you over JC Chasez, so you have to perform.
Well, maybe it is.<eos> Why?<eos> Adam: I break things, Mira.<eos> That's what I do.<eos> It's why I avoided you for so long, 'cause I didn't wanna break you.
And actually... this would give us more time to rehearse as The Michaels Sisters!<eos> Oh, my God, we are not The Michaels Sisters!<eos> You know what? You're basically forcing me to sell my Sweet Sixteen necklace.<eos> How do you feel about that?<eos> How does that sit with you, Mom?
Wow, ooh, are you serious?<eos> That's really kind of you.<eos> That's so cool.<eos> Uh, because I'm not really ready to... to have a kid.<eos> And I feel like a POS telling you to get an abortion or whatever. I mean, that's not my place.
- Yes!<eos> And it's, like, kindergarten or first grade and sleepovers are, like, all the rage and everyone's doing it every Friday and Saturday night, and you're just like, "No, I can't.<eos> I need to be with my mom, I need to have my own sheets, I need to have my own toilet.<eos> I can't."<eos> - Yes. - And then one day, someone asks you.
Come on.<eos> Evening, Zelda.<eos> Evening, Mr. and Mrs. Weaver.<eos> I went to school with her granddaughter Delia.<eos> Does everyone in town know you?
By the look of it, I can't disagree.<eos> That's not exactly a virtue in this town.<eos> Everybody knows everybody else's business. It's exhausting.<eos> You want to know what I think?<eos> I think that these people that supposedly know you don't know you at all.
Yes, so he says. What exactly has he written?<eos> As a judge, I've written more than he has.<eos> Dear, he's young.<eos> Zelda, you've only known this young man for a few months.<eos> What do you really know about him besides what he's told you?
See what you've done now on your little quest for stupid vengeance?<eos> She's innocent.<eos> Stop it.<eos> Stop crying.<eos> Alex, what happened to you?
Go.<eos> Go.<eos> Just start walking.<eos> Follow the road.<eos> It... it's gonna take you back to the main highway.
Norman's dangerous.<eos> He's not dangerous to me.<eos> You sound like Norma.<eos> Tell me you love me, Emma.<eos> I'm not gonna arm you up so you can go and do something stupid.
Why?<eos> To tell him that you know he sent someone to kill you and you're still alive?<eos> - Basically, yes.<eos> - That's kind of dumb.<eos> I mean, wouldn't it be better to let him think that you're dead so he leaves you alone?
- Basically, yes.<eos> - That's kind of dumb.<eos> I mean, wouldn't it be better to let him think that you're dead so he leaves you alone?<eos> Mother, he is going to get out someday, and we have to deal with it.<eos> He thinks that I killed you, remember?
Is it a bad time?<eos> Mm. Never mind.<eos> It's just an expression.<eos> I'm here.<eos> I brought these for you.
Business meeting, huh?<eos> For the love of God, Mother, what are you doing here?<eos> I could just as easily ask you that question.<eos> Mother, I am not the one who's supposed to be dead.<eos> I mean, what if someone saw you in here?
- I looked.<eos> - Mother!<eos> Just go out the window now.<eos> Take the keys.<eos> Get in the back of the car and lay down so no one can see you.
You're forgetting about the part where you almost got me and my son killed.<eos> Dylan.<eos> Norma's kid.<eos> Your kid.<eos> Don't you dare talk about her like that, or I will kill you.
But no one knew... on a roof in that same lane... a man stood between life and death.<eos> They say your life flashes in front of your eyes before you die.<eos> But the only thing he could see...<eos> Was the face of that girl.<eos> Many teach you how to love... ..alas no one teaches you how to forget that love.
You don't answer any calls.<eos> I'm fed up of calling.<eos> God answers but not you.<eos> Quiet!<eos> The publisher paid you two years ago.
Final score.<eos> Life: 2.<eos> Abhimanyu Roy: 0.<eos> Run' run'<eos> Who asked you to End the car?
This is me.<eos> Life is crazy.<eos> Australia is crazy.<eos> Sending you a postcard, so I don't have to write a lot.<eos> Who told you to do an MBA?
Who told you to do an MBA?<eos> You write well, You should've become a writer.<eos> You'd be happier and nap in the afternoons.<eos> Love and kisses to Devdas.<eos> I miss you too.
Ioving a girl like her is free falling.<eos> No one knows Where you will land... and in how many pieces.<eos> - Here's your pen.<eos> - At least hand onto that.<eos> God bless you!
- At least hand onto that.<eos> God bless you!<eos> But no one had Warned me... despite all the suffering in love... you're ready to do it again.<eos> To give love another shot.<eos> Many teach you how to love... alas, no one teaches you how to forget that love.
- He's run off, That rascal.<eos> - who?<eos> That South Indian guy?<eos> Mr Matthew?<eos> This time he dumped you.
Want a bet?<eos> - Get the cash from an ATM.<eos> - It's on!<eos> Take her away, Where will I sleep?<eos> He doesn't love you.
Come to me now.<eos> "Is it the night, or your black flowing hair...<eos> Beautiful!<eos> Stop your midnight poetry!<eos> Nobody's talking to you. You fool!
- walking side by side?"<eos> - Shut up!<eos> I must tell her what I feel about her.<eos> She already knows.<eos> Everybody knows, even people who don't know you, know.
Three Words starts With 'I.'<eos> That's the clue?<eos> - Check it.<eos> - Really?<eos> I love you?
Sometimes float with the clouds... in the open sky.<eos> What are you scared of?<eos> Listen sometime, your heart says things.<eos> Listen sometime, your heart says things.<eos> Can't you hear the sky is calling you.
Bindu.<eos> In one Word...<eos> My neighbour, my best friend.<eos> You and me. music playing in the background.<eos> Many teach you how to love... alas no one teaches you... how to forget that love.
I must find him.<eos> We willfind him.<eos> We?<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> This is my problem, and I will no longer put you in danger.
Do you have something against women or just sex?<eos> Be careful with your tongue.<eos> I do not allow women to speak to me this way.<eos> Well, when you get in that time machine, make sure you go backwards.<eos> Won't get any better for you in the future where women are concerned.
Do you know which way downtown is?<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> Are you following me?<eos> What?<eos> Did Vanessa send you to follow me?
What?<eos> You didn't think I was gonna go alone now, did you?<eos> No. No!<eos> Let her go, John.<eos> I thought I might see you here.
Vanessa's one of the richest women in the world.<eos> She might be even wealthier than Oprah.<eos> What is an Oprah?<eos> Never mind.<eos> How does she know you?
You would be tempted to alter it.<eos> Maybe the future you was scared you might do that.<eos> Which implies that something must happen that would tempt me.<eos> What if you don't find John?<eos> I will find John, and he will pay for what he did to you.
You look great.<eos> - I have to cut it.<eos> - No way.<eos> Don't mention my hair or my job interview.<eos> I can help you with that.
- No way.<eos> Don't mention my hair or my job interview.<eos> I can help you with that.<eos> I'm a hairdresser now!<eos> No, seriously, I know of a job that might interest you.
- No, I'll have it.<eos> - What?<eos> Are you stupid?<eos> Look at it, please.<eos> But, Laura, your father will kill you.
Well, my ex.<eos> He called and said he wanted to see me.<eos> I told him I was with you. But he kept insisting, so I saw him earlier.<eos> The thing is, we'd taken some time out but we never split up.<eos> And then I met you.
Don't get all sanctimonious.<eos> There's a party on Saturday night. I'll be home late.<eos> Carlos, sit down. Your mother and I want to talk to you.<eos> Vazquez called. We know you haven't been in class for two weeks.<eos> Did we put any pressure on you to study law?
What a pain.<eos> You're making a mess of that.<eos> Let me do it.<eos> I told Alex that Susana fancies him and wants to screw him.<eos> She'll kill you.
- I'll see you later.<eos> Laura!<eos> Where are you going?<eos> - Have you seen my boyfriend?<eos> - No, but if I were him, I wouldn't leave you on your own.
- You know him?<eos> - Of course.<eos> They say he was killed falling off a horse, but I think it was suicide.<eos> My turn.<eos> There's a room full of paintings with people who seem to look at you as if you'd killed someone.
And the clergy here are the scariest.<eos> - They terrify me.<eos> - My God!<eos> - Look at their faces! - You see? They're looking at us.<eos> And here's the secret door I told you about. This leads to the bedrooms.
That's over. It was a mistake.<eos> Know what?<eos> My sister was born. When I held her I thought she was our daughter.<eos> I love you.<eos> I think I'll always love you.
- When did you come in?<eos> - Just last night.<eos> Do you remember last night, Norman?<eos> I was, uh, just drinking more than I should have, so, you know, things are a little foggy.<eos> I found you passed out, so I put you to bed.
You're like an animal I have to beat some sense into!<eos> We're both in for almost 30 goddamn years!<eos> Some asshole, they took money. Can't find anything!<eos> I love you, Caleb.<eos> I love you too, Norma Louise.
You said so yourself.<eos> That's not my role here.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I don't feel that I have the authority to act in that manner.<eos> This is between you and Norma, and what happens to you now, it's up to Norma, and I'm just an observer.
And Norma...<eos> Norma... Norma's...<eos> Look, he killed her.<eos> He froze her. Who does that?<eos> Look, I understand that you're very concerned about what's gonna happen to you.
Over there.<eos> Okay.<eos> Keys and your cell phone.<eos> Let's go.<eos> I won't tell anyone I saw you.
She let me know when Dylan was born.<eos> Norman.<eos> I mean, I could think of her, laughing or dancing... playing the piano.<eos> She's... She's got this look she's had since she was, like, a little kid, where she would look at somebody so hard that you would think that they were gonna burst into flames.<eos> I mean, God help you if she looked at you like that.
That was her last word?<eos> Fort?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We believe that might help us find out who killed your wife and why.<eos> You know what they don't tell you about non-fat?
I still don't understand.<eos> I don't know. I stopped listening.<eos> I'm just saying, I wish TV shows and movies just obeyed those rules a little bit.<eos> Why are you talking quieter?<eos> Did somebody ground you?
Is your mom here?<eos> - No, am I talking quieter?<eos> - Mama Gus!<eos> I guess I just, uh, became self-aware of how dorky this conversation is, and I don't want anybody to overhear us, so...<eos> Those girls can't hear you! It doesn't matter.
I don't wanna talk about pinworms.<eos> I wanna play TableTopics.<eos> Come on, enough about the worms!<eos> Who's thirsty?<eos> So, what else keeps you up at night?
Battered and bruised, slashed and gashed, ripped up, tripped up, turned around, but never torn down.<eos> Made from the part bin and hungry for one more win!<eos> Part man, part machine, all legend.<eos> The one, the only, Frankenstein!<eos> They really love you.
Why do you care about this goddamn race so much?<eos> Because it's my job.<eos> And this might seem kind of strange nowadays, but I dedicated my life to this race.<eos> Nice line.<eos> Did The Chairman write it for you?
Maybe you're right.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I should have taken a chance on you.<eos> I should've told you right from the start that I was Resistance.<eos> I knew the very first moment that I saw you.
Because I thought this might be interesting and I don't give a shit about politics.<eos> Of course, because all you care about is the fucking race!<eos> Millions of people stuck in their miserable lives, but none of that matters as long as you win!<eos> God, the people love you!<eos> God damn it, the people love you!
Sorry, I didn't know you were in here.<eos> I will go.<eos> I'm off the clock, girl, I don't bite.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Fighting with Frank got you down?
When I start walking down this car, I want you to grab that backpack, there. See it?<eos> Bryan, what's going on?<eos> - Do you see it?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> If the guy in the sport coat tells you it's his, you argue with him and you keep it going until I either come back or I shout out your name.
Channel 7, may I ask you a question?<eos> This is a very difficult time for my family, as you can see.<eos> A little respect for that right now would be<eos> - much appreciated.<eos> - Bryan, what tipped you off?
Let's just take a breath here, okay?<eos> Talk to Joe Roberts.<eos> Have him post a police detail outside this house, front and back 24 hours a day.<eos> - And tell him what?<eos> - Tell him what I just told you.
- Let him go! - Aah!<eos> I got you, Mike.<eos> I got you.<eos> Daddy, you're sweating like a pig.<eos> - Oh. - Someone's calling you.
That's his phone.<eos> Incoming call. 703 area code.<eos> You and Lianne on the road yet?<eos> You know I can't just leave you hanging out there.<eos> I told you, don't worry about me.
Give me the 22 blade.<eos> Your son died holding a gun to the head of a DEA agent.<eos> My sister died defenseless.<eos> And innocent.<eos> So what kind of a man, I wonder, does that make you?
Those are ice chips in that blue cup.<eos> You were at my sister's funeral.<eos> Yes, I was.<eos> Who are you?<eos> The man who shot you works for me.
I don't understand what is happening.<eos> You've been asleep for almost two hours.<eos> Zack, listen to me.<eos> Let me go.<eos> If you don't, Booth will find you, and when he does...
Zack, listen to me.<eos> Let me go.<eos> If you don't, Booth will find you, and when he does...<eos> I'd prefer you not talk about him.<eos> Zack, what has happened to you?
No... what?<eos> No, I'm fine.<eos> Nothing is wrong with me.<eos> What are you talking about, "fine"?<eos> Nothing's wrong with you?
Don't say it out loud. Okay.<eos> - You can nod and smile.<eos> - That's good.<eos> Truman!<eos> Been trying to call you.
I don't know why.<eos> Christ.<eos> Nice boxers, dude.<eos> Yeah, they're not mine.<eos> Doesn't bother you that there's another guy's boxers in here?
- I thought I had inside information.<eos> - No, shut up.<eos> I just want everybody to be safe.<eos> You can't steal his car.<eos> Is that what he told you?
We're already $160,000 over budget on this episode, and then this guy just almost fuckin' dies.<eos> If I really think about it, it's probably, like, the eighth-toughest day I've had in the last two months.<eos> Jesus!<eos> Yeah, well, the fun part is I just learned that if this guy decides to sue us, and we have to pay him out, apparently, all that shit comes out of my back end.<eos> What? That's funny to you?
So, the Commissioner is like your grandmother's old goat?<eos> That's exactly what he's like.<eos> Oh. Martha!<eos> Oh, my God, I am so sorry.<eos> I couldn't find you at the airport and I was going to call, but that's when I realised I'd left my phone in the Jeep, and I went to get it, I couldn't remember where I'd parked...
I think maybe the flight's caught up with me.<eos> Erm, Catherine was just about to take me to my room.<eos> But maybe Humphrey can show you.<eos> Gosh, yes, the least I could do.<eos> Let me help you with your bags.
OK.<eos> OK, then.<eos> Night.<eos> Idiot!<eos> And that's all he said to you?
- Wait, really?<eos> Will you be okay?<eos> I don't want to...<eos> Go tell them you're coming before they change their minds.<eos> - I'll see you there.
- Ha, ha, ha... You guys sleep up in the nosebleeds if you want to.<eos> Tank Evans is not scared of some little forest critters.<eos> Neither is my main girl Michelle.<eos> Isn't that right, baby?<eos> Big Daddy won't let anything harm you.
Dude, that's hardcore.<eos> Hey, this isn't a tomb.<eos> It's a surfer's hall of fame.<eos> Oh, man. This is so awesome. Wow!<eos> Do you think people will remember you like that?
Help!<eos> Tank!<eos> Hang on, I'm coming.<eos> Hunter!<eos> Hunter, Hanky needs you.
- Oh, dude. Welcome back.<eos> You okay, big guy?<eos> Forget about me.<eos> Go help them.<eos> - What happened to you?
It's firm but soft on top.<eos> I love this bed, Gus.<eos> - Okay, all right, Randy. - Mmm?<eos> Hey, we really shouldn't be here, okay?<eos> The coyote helped you out, and that's awesome... but we need to get home now. Okay, buddy?
- Randy, please.<eos> - I really don't like what's happening.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> You are so in your head right now.<eos> What's happening to you is irrelevant to me.
One and the same.<eos> So, George found that it took 48 hours to fully dissolve a body to the point where you could actually pour it down the drain<eos> - without clogging the pipes.<eos> - Of course.<eos> When killing someone, it's definitely plumbing that keeps you up at night.
You fought with him.<eos> His facial bones were broken.<eos> There's extensive fracturing to the ribs.<eos> You hit him so hard your hand was broken.<eos> Who told you about that?
I don't know anything about drugs.<eos> And just so we're super clear on that, I'm gonna go call my lawyer.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Okay, you do that.<eos> You call your lawyer, and he'll get you out in no time.
Sorry.<eos> I wish I could be more help.<eos> Yeah, well, actually, you know what, you can.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> This is one of those video doorbells that record you, right?
And you enjoyed telling everyone about it.<eos> Okay.<eos> A little.<eos> Only because you're so professional.<eos> I mean, if you weren't, I would kiss you right now.
Why did both of you come here to give me this information?<eos> We wanted to see how you were.<eos> Not well.<eos> I find it difficult being separated from my children.<eos> Well, no one would blame you for being with them.
Not well.<eos> I find it difficult being separated from my children.<eos> Well, no one would blame you for being with them.<eos> This is not going to end until we find evidence to stop Mark Kovac.<eos> Usually, you let the evidence lead you to the suspect.
I'm fine, I'm fine.<eos> Nothing that I haven't been through before.<eos> How are the kids?<eos> The kids are fine.<eos> Who did this to you, Max?
FBI.<eos> Charlene was our brave teller who was held up.<eos> I'm sorry, I already spoke to an agent about the robbery.<eos> Yeah, this is about a homicide.<eos> The man who robbed you was murdered.
Why? Well, the Freemasons, the west, with the setting sun represented finished projects and death.<eos> Um, Agent Aubrey, I think I have a solution for you-- you should let the idiot go free.<eos> What?<eos> No. At minimum, the guy's an accessory.<eos> Which is why you should keep him in your sight, but first let him lead you to his partner in crime.
Um, sorry,<eos> I'm trying to decide what to write my dissertation about.<eos> I recommend you choose wisely, as it will be one of the most important decisions of your professional career.<eos> Thanks. As if I wasn't already stressing enough.<eos> What is it that excites you about the field of anthropology?
He was.<eos> Ronny was a sweetheart.<eos> He just got caught up and taken for a ride.<eos> You got to be careful.<eos> This industry will eat you alive if you let it.
Hopefully not for long.<eos> But I promise, okay?<eos> We're gonna keep you safe.<eos> James Aubrey.<eos> You look about ten years older than the last time I saw you.
- 'I know.'<eos> It's worrying, isn't it?<eos> 'It is a bit.'<eos> But he won't ask or notice.<eos> Tell me something that winds you up about him.
I can't help it.<eos> It turns me on, it just does.<eos> It's probably... It's probably genetic.<eos> Christ, do you really think that means something?<eos> That that absolves you of all responsibility, just hard-wiring?
Microwaved to perfection, if I may say.<eos> I did try.<eos> Oh, if you're not hungry, you're not hungry.<eos> It's... It's girl trouble.<eos> He's talked to you?
There are some truly awful men out there.<eos> I know, I've dated most of them!<eos> No, really monstrous.<eos> Anyway...<eos> - Is he treating you all right? - Mmm.
I think about you every single day.<eos> Most minutes of each day, if I'm honest.<eos> This is what I cling to.<eos> While you're off saving the free world, you think of me because you saw me,<eos> I really think you did... and I saw you, and that's a rare thing between two human beings.
He mentioned to me last night he was thinking of heading back.<eos> I presumed he meant at the end of the week.<eos> What did I do?<eos> Why does he find it so easy to talk to you and bloody impossible to talk to me?<eos> Hey, Adam loves you to bits, you know he does.
Has something happened?<eos> Are you all right?<eos> It's George Selway, he won't leave me alone.<eos> He must have followed me to the hairdressers and he just turned up in the shop near my house.<eos> Wait, hang on. Are you saying he's stalking you now?
"Dear X, you saw me. I really think you did. And I saw you."
Rosa came with me to the conference.<eos> So you are sleeping with her?<eos> It's George Selway.<eos> He won't leave me alone.<eos> Wait, hang on, are you saying he's stalking you now?
We see it the whole time.<eos> You ladies do make our job rather difficult.<eos> What are you thinking, Laurence?<eos> Shall I tell you what's going on in your head, biologically?<eos> There's a part of your brain, the amygdala, it's telling you to do whatever you need to do to survive.
You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> But if you do... I'm here.<eos> I wish I'd talked to you.<eos> I wish I'd talked to you about everything.
I really wish I could have been there.<eos> I know.<eos> - Oh, bloody hell!<eos> - Oh, aye, come on, now...<eos> Hm? Just remember everything Robert's told you about making a good impression and we'll get home and see that baby, yeah?
I don't know why you're not getting this.<eos> You have to make the call now, Mellie, before too much time goes by!<eos> You wait too long, the press out there is gonna say you're ungracious.<eos> They're gonna label you a sore loser.<eos> And because you're a woman, half of them are gonna call you a bitch, and half of them are gonna report that you cried.
You... You know better.<eos> You... You... You are better.<eos> You are faster, stronger, and smarter than him.<eos> How could you be so weak?<eos> How would you let that man outplay you?
You are faster, stronger, and smarter than him.<eos> How could you be so weak?<eos> How would you let that man outplay you?<eos> That's what happened, Olivia.<eos> He outplayed you in the generals, and he outplayed you tonight when he paid an assassin to shoot Frankie Vargas!
Uh, you mean, like, when you look at a light bulb and when you look away you still kind of see it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, there's this more extreme version called palinopsia.<eos> It literally means "seeing again."<eos> I mean, the image just stays with you... And you see it again.
Because the heel comes down first.<eos> It bears all the weight.<eos> So what do you see?<eos> No prints, nothing.<eos> And that tells you what?
That's definitely not on the test, or any high school test.<eos> I wonder if any of us have changed.<eos> And if we did, would there be any way to tell?<eos> Like a DNA test?<eos> I was thinking a different type of test... Ow! What the hell is wrong with you?
Give me a second, okay?<eos> I'll figure out a way to work this thing out.<eos> An image.<eos> Right?<eos> The one that they sent to you?
Noel's dead, but Jenna's still out there.<eos> - I mean, we have to find her.<eos> - We will.<eos> But I'm not taking any chances with you.<eos> The last time I let you out of my sight I lost you down a rabbit hole.
Oh, did you make an appointment?<eos> We'll go to the doctors together.<eos> I've already been.<eos> That's why I'm late.<eos> But, but I promised I'd come with you.
- You should have called me.<eos> - It's my nightmare, not yours.<eos> So, how was it, the doctor?<eos> Humiliating.<eos> What did she tell you?
It's gonna depend a great deal in the next few minutes.<eos> - Mary Drake.<eos> - Where is she?<eos> She's temporarily unaccounted for.<eos> What did she tell you?
And I got this terrible cold feeling in my stomach.<eos> She told me that it, it happened before, but this time they knew who the father was.<eos> Because Mary told them.<eos> Apparently, your father was in a restaurant when Jessica walked in or who he thought was Jessica.<eos> Dad did this to you.
She told me that it, it happened before, but this time they knew who the father was.<eos> Because Mary told them.<eos> Apparently, your father was in a restaurant when Jessica walked in or who he thought was Jessica.<eos> Dad did this to you.<eos> He did this to you again?
What are you doing here?<eos> This is my sister's business.<eos> She needed a brilliant but affordable chef.<eos> - Mary Drake.<eos> - What did she tell you?
It's my fault.<eos> I have this intense history with the both of you.<eos> You and Ali have your own weird history.<eos> When you told me what she did that night on my porch, I... I fell for you hard.<eos> Wanted to protect you ever since.
We could stop and have a nice lunch...<eos> Who was on the phone?<eos> Was it dad?<eos> How long is he gonna put off coming home to face me?<eos> Honey, your father's not avoiding you.
He's hurting too, Spencer.<eos> This isn't how either one of us wanted you to find out.<eos> What does Melissa know?<eos> Did she sign some secret family pact to keep me in the dark too?<eos> Your sister loves you.
Nineteen.<eos> The beading, the belt, the collar.<eos> Hanna, Claudia Greco was a dragon.<eos> She stole your soul for three years not to mention our relationship.<eos> I mean, the least that she could give you was a belt.
- You need help. - No, I don't.<eos> Yes, I do. How are you with tabbouleh?<eos> Bulgur's there, parsley's done.<eos> Tomatoes just need to be chopped.<eos> Can I trust you with a knife?
Can I just say one more thing that's like really bugging me?<eos> Besides the fact that you can't say Nicole's name?<eos> I can.<eos> I just don't really like to.<eos> So what else bugs you?
I mean, where did he even read that?<eos> Did Ezra propose to her first?<eos> Y-you wrote a book with the guy.<eos> You've known him forever. Why would he keep that a secret?<eos> Don't you think he would have told you?
Well, I don't see why it matters now.<eos> You've got the ring.<eos> So why does he keep putting it off?<eos> She still doesn't even know that we're engaged.<eos> Is Ezra the only person who's ever told you he loved you?
And if she strong-arms any of her other teammates and files a formal complaint... Okay.<eos> I'll let Hackett handle this.<eos> I mean, if I confront the kid, it'll be worse.<eos> Like I do have something to hide.<eos> And if you challenge her, she'll turn you into a predator too.
Could you take Ms. Marshall to the conference room?<eos> I'll join you shortly.<eos> Do you wanna see a real sociopath?<eos> Because you have one walking into your conference room right now.<eos> Spencer, the bullet that hit you did not match the gun that Jenna was holding.
They didn't have any instruments.<eos> Unless they're the kind that you pack in holsters.<eos> Caleb, I suggest you back off. Hm.<eos> That's my suggestion.<eos> Who brought you back to Rosewood this time?
She's sleeping.<eos> I'm so sorry that she just took off...<eos> Someone saw her getting into a cab outside the trauma clinic.<eos> Her therapist, her parents we've all been looking for her for hours.<eos> She didn't tell you that she was coming here?
How did it even get there?<eos> Well, Clara Mott tripped in the teacher's lounge and got it all over me.<eos> Never mind, wear this.<eos> So what happened last night?<eos> Did Sydney lead you to Jenna?
Yeah, I, I caught an earlier flight.<eos> I wish I could have been here sooner after everything you've been going through.<eos> You mean getting shot or finding out that mom isn't my real mom?<eos> She's your real mom, Spencer.<eos> She raised you.
- Do you need to sit down?<eos> - Where is it?<eos> What, what are you looking for?<eos> The puzzle piece.<eos> They must have told you to put it somewhere.
You shot Spencer.<eos> You help Jenna escape.<eos> - You made up the game?<eos> - Correct.<eos> I barely know you, Sydney, why are you doing this?
- Not mine.<eos> It's a friend's.<eos> I mean the mess is mine but all the nice stuff is on loan.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I lied to you today.
Did something happen?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Something happened.<eos> For starters, you left Allie.<eos> You just abandoned her when she needed you.
I designed this when I was working for Claudia.<eos> _<eos> "Dearest, it wasn't supposed to be this way.<eos> "I did what I did because people like my sister and the Hastings deserve to be punished."<eos> The bullet that hit you did not match the gun that Jenna was holding.
He's not gonna find it.<eos> What, guys aren't gonna go through a girl's purse because they're too afraid to accidently touch a tampon.<eos> Okay, well, how long are we gonna keep this game a secret?<eos> I mean, A.D. practically dragged Paige into the middle of it..<eos> So, Mona wasn't kidding when she said she'll get you in the "Style" section.
And it might help you get your mind off of everything that's been twisting' you up lately.<eos> That does sound really nice.<eos> You'd actually be doing me a favor.<eos> And get that frown off your face.<eos> Might make me feel better about not finding the person who shot you.
I can try.<eos> Sydney?<eos> What's it been, like, five years?<eos> Are we really gonna do this whole "What a coincidence" thing?<eos> Who sent you, Caleb or Mona?
- Caleb!<eos> - Hey.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I thought I would be in and out by now.<eos> Wait, Hanna told you?
- Hi!<eos> My friend is having trouble breathing.<eos> Please, this is an emergency!<eos> Here.<eos> Let me help you with that..
"Solve the puzzle and get away with murder."<eos> "Or fail and go directly to jail."<eos> Cops get one more clue about what we did...<eos> It's game over.<eos> All that talk about Lucas backing you all the way, he's selling your business out from under you before we've even started.
You'll do as you're told.<eos> And don't forget about Ezra.<eos> He's just a document away from going to prison.<eos> Mona, hurry.<eos> I brought you here to help me.
Well, I was pushing Moscow Mules at the Radley for a while I know where all the paper work is.<eos> I mean, the codes on the doors change weekly, but...<eos> I can get them.<eos> My mom's office.<eos> - What if someone sees you?
I mean, the codes on the doors change weekly, but...<eos> I can get them.<eos> My mom's office.<eos> - What if someone sees you?<eos> - What if Lucas sees you?
We owe it to her.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> What does that mean, Hanna?<eos> I don't think that she would have self-sabotaged that night if it wasn't for everything going on with the three of us.<eos> I was there behind the door when you were begging her to let you in.
Isn't it?<eos> You weren't drinking at that bar to celebrate.<eos> I'm gonna go get some rest.<eos> Wait, Spencer.<eos> Hanna and I aren't gonna let you down this time.
There's no way whoever's at that school could beat us back here.<eos> Em, it's gonna be okay.<eos> - We-we can fix it. - Here.<eos> Look, we can glue this back together, see?<eos> Em, don't let this scare you.
Why?<eos> Mom, you've spent your whole life helping me.<eos> Doing things you shouldn't have had to do.<eos> Because I love you.<eos> And now it's time for me to show you how much I love you by not letting you get involved.
Mom, you've spent your whole life helping me.<eos> Doing things you shouldn't have had to do.<eos> Because I love you.<eos> And now it's time for me to show you how much I love you by not letting you get involved.<eos> Hey, did your mom find you?
So, I've been thinking.<eos> The game has to connect to the Internet and it does that with an IP address which is like a phone number.<eos> I'm writing a program right now to search the cell towers in Rosewood.<eos> When the game connects, I might be able to find his location.<eos> No wonder they call you "Too genius, too furious."
Mona?<eos> What has Mona have to do...<eos> Were you in our nursery?<eos> Did you put the recording in Spencer's house?<eos> I mean, did A.D. ask you to do this and in return give you a puzzle piece?
I filled out a police report that was accusing him of trying to take advantage of me.<eos> I never filed it, but somehow A.D. got it and threatened to turn it in.<eos> Ezra would have gone to jail.<eos> So, what?<eos> It was just a nobrainer of you to pick Ezra over us?
For now.<eos> You're free to go home.<eos> Hope you get a good night's sleep.<eos> - You disappointed me.<eos> - I disappointed you?
- The truth.<eos> Most of which I am not happy about.<eos> And tomorrow it's gonna be all hands on deck.<eos> I've already got a call into a new lawyer and I...<eos> But tonight... I'm just gonna be happy that you have found a man who loves you and wants to protect you.
That's it for tonight, folks.<eos> You want me to get next week?<eos> Same time, same place.<eos> Same feet.<eos> - Did I step on you?
What's the question?<eos> Did I try to protect my family from a deranged sociopath who wanted to shatter our lives?<eos> Hell, yes!<eos> And I'd do it again.<eos> If someone continually threatens you, Spencer... I don't think you'd do anything different.
You're dead.<eos> You know everything.<eos> Who is A.D.?<eos> God, you're no help.<eos> I should have just let that cop find you.
I-I can fix this.<eos> I can.<eos> Good.<eos> Glad you agree.<eos> How's the wedding night going for you?
Ali...<eos> Look, it took me so long to finally get here with you.<eos> Okay?<eos> I didn't come all that way to lose everything now.<eos> I promise you I won't let them hurt you.
- Do what?<eos> I can make it up to them, I can take the blame.<eos> First of all, I'm-I'm not interested in you making any more sacrifices for your friends.<eos> Second, Aria, you have an alibi, you're in the clear.<eos> There's nothing linking you to what happened with Dunhill.
Yes, okay, the body is a problem but more importantly... I can't leave my friends.<eos> I think they gave up the right to be your friends.<eos> No, they haven't.<eos> I'm the one who made the bad choice.<eos> When someone puts you in a box and nails the lid shut part of you will always be locked in that box in the dark afraid and crying, but... you can't let that trap part do the thinking for you.
- Ali, Emily.<eos> Open the door.<eos> - Oh, my...<eos> Mona said she doesn't have the game anymore.<eos> - She said that to you?
I see her right now.<eos> None of you are sure when you look in the mirror.<eos> None of you are really certain who you are.<eos> I did that.<eos> I took that away from you the same way everything was stolen from me.
That taste in your mouth that's what dying tastes like.<eos> Get used to it.<eos> Because you're gonna choke on it everyday for the rest of your long miserable life.<eos> I knew you didn't have the guts.<eos> They will never love you.
If Scofield killed Harlan Gaines, we take him to the police, if we have to.<eos> We get this done the right way.<eos> Poseidon would never let us live.<eos> He won't find us.<eos> I told you.
I'm scared.<eos> - Okay.<eos> They've come for you.<eos> - Who?<eos> I am not gonna let them hurt you, you understand?
We've got to get you out of here right now.<eos> Okay, you got to give me some direction here, you know?<eos> Some, um... fatherly advice on how to deal with having a father that's, um... you.<eos> Well, you know, uh...<eos> Is this blood freaking you out like it's freaking me out?
Is there a BlueHawaii in there?<eos> Yeah, don't just dillydally, come on in.<eos> I assume you two desperados are Scofield's guys.<eos> Yeah.<eos> He get you out of prison, too?
Yeah.<eos> He get you out of prison, too?<eos> No.<eos> But I do owe him.<eos> Where'd he break you out of?
The truth is, we never left.<eos> You're not holding the cards.<eos> - I am.<eos> - Are you?<eos> Every law agency in the world is looking for you.
- Oh, you scared me. Sorry.<eos> Hi.<eos> Ali got me, and I got her.<eos> That's the thing about love.<eos> Love changes you.
Enjoy your freedom while you can.<eos> You look gorgeous, as always.<eos> You guys need to stop bringing him.<eos> Okay, I have something to show you guys.<eos> I may just push you in the pool. Uh-oh.
- I'm Holly.<eos> - Tyler.<eos> - Nice to meet you.<eos> - Nice to meet you.<eos> Sorry, who would ditch you? I don't...
I've been looking everywhere for you.<eos> - Hey, you all right?<eos> What's going on?<eos> - Chase seems like a keeper.<eos> What did he say to you?
Be nice.<eos> - Hey, I got your usuals.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> And here.<eos> Thanks. What happened to you this weekend?
Oh, thank you.<eos> I'll tell you a secret.<eos> I always wanted a little sister.<eos> So maybe... you and I can just hang out, us girls.<eos> Hey, why don't I walk you out?
How's the hospital?<eos> Hot nurses?<eos> - The sponge baths are great. - Ooh.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> What's up with you?
'Cause it was just so obvious that Tyler loves me more than he loves you.<eos> But then, you just kept getting in the way.<eos> This is my fault, Holly.<eos> Don't take it out on Ali.<eos> I pushed you to this.
Let's get out of here.<eos> That's the thing about love.<eos> At first, everything about it seems to make sense.<eos> But the deeper you get, the more you realize you don't know anything at all.<eos> Love teaches you.
That's the thing about love.<eos> At first, everything about it seems to make sense.<eos> But the deeper you get, the more you realize you don't know anything at all.<eos> Love teaches you.<eos> Love changes you.
Which gets us to why I'm really here.<eos> I could've just told you all that information on the phone but what I wanted to do was thank you.<eos> For saving my life.<eos> You don't need to thank me.<eos> I'm the one that should be apologizing to you.
Is that her?<eos> Let me check.<eos> Stay inside.<eos> Well, now, aren't you a sight?<eos> You're sure no one followed you?
Ah, well, heavy head, heavy crown, et cetera, et cetera.<eos> If I kill Alistair, his theory gains traction.<eos> The vampires turn against me.<eos> They storm the city.<eos> And if they find you, all they need is a drop of your blood, and then their witches can track your family.
And what I've learned is, the best way to end your fear is to face it yourself.<eos> So, for you, a gift, the sword that you gave me, now laced with my venom.<eos> One slice will draw Klaus' blood and deliver the slow, agonizing death that he deserves.<eos> It would be my highest honor.<eos> Took a long time, but we finally caught you.
Congratulations.<eos> You handled that rather well.<eos> Alistair's a corpse.<eos> Klaus is a prisoner.<eos> And every vampire in this town either loves you or fears you.
Come in, Polis.<eos> Come on. Where are you?<eos> What have I done?<eos> What have we done?<eos> I told you to stay upstairs with the rest of the wounded.
First, tell me how my friends are.<eos> Did everyone make it?<eos> Clarke?<eos> I'm here, thanks to you.<eos> Raven, did A.L.I.E. ever tell you why she created the City of Light?
I'm serious, Emori, ok?<eos> We can be together there.<eos> My people will protect you.<eos> Are you sure about that?<eos> How many times have they cast you out?
Of course it wasn't.<eos> You were a bargaining chip.<eos> It almost broke your mother to send you away.<eos> Killing Lexa in soulou gonplei was to be your triumphant return, but you lost.<eos> Our war chiefs don't respect you.
I can help you do what your mother never could, what Ontari never could.<eos> - Rule everything.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Trikru is weak and ready to fall, and Skaikru is more hated than ever.<eos> Give the order to take them both out, and our war chiefs will follow you.
- Rule everything.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Trikru is weak and ready to fall, and Skaikru is more hated than ever.<eos> Give the order to take them both out, and our war chiefs will follow you.<eos> Show them Wanheda's head while you do it, and they will worship you.
We were told it was lost.<eos> You give me one good reason why I shouldn't just take that and cut your head off.<eos> I just gave you one, and you know I wouldn't be offering this unless what I was saying were true.<eos> Take it.<eos> The clans will follow you.
But what if you're wrong?<eos> If there's no oil, do we lose the ranch?<eos> Well, that's always a risk.<eos> Any time you find a decent piece of land, sure as sunup, someone out there's gonna try and take it from you.<eos> Does that scare you?
Mind my bag.<eos> Why, Sally McCullough.<eos> I had no idea it was possible for a wildflower to bloom indoors.<eos> Phineas.<eos> What kept you?
Then find another doctor.<eos> - Well?<eos> - He wants to admit me on Monday.<eos> He said that?<eos> He said he'll admit you?
Yeah.<eos> - Now, I'm gonna be honest with you.<eos> - I'm not crazy about your name.<eos> - What?<eos> "Ellen" doesn't suit you.
- I've never really liked it.<eos> - So, change it.<eos> I can't just change it.<eos> I can't, right?<eos> Just tell people to call you by a different name.
Here you go.<eos> You're shaking like a chihuahua.<eos> I know what you're trying to do.<eos> Life's beautiful and all that... shit.<eos> And that upsets you because...?
- Fucking knee.<eos> - That knee.<eos> Yup.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Did somebody bad touch you as a kid or something?
Oh, okay.<eos> This rexie girl, who saw my stuff on Tumblr, liked the way I saw... so much, that when she slit her wrists, she left me the fucking note.<eos> And you know what her parents did?<eos> They sent me pictures... so I'd really know what I'd done.<eos> People say they love you... but what they mean is, they love how loving you makes them feel about themselves. Or... Or they love what they can take from you.
It is in the small things that we see it.<eos> The child's first step, as awesome as an earthquake.<eos> The first time you rode a bike, wallowing up the sidewalk.<eos> The first spanking, when your heart went on a journey all alone.<eos> When they called you 'crybaby' or 'poor' or 'fatty' or 'crazy'... and made you into an alien... "you drank their acid and you concealed it."
- Where is Luke, anyway?<eos> - He's at the doctor for his knee.<eos> Eli?<eos> Eli.<eos> What's going on with you?
It stops you from experiencing anything, including anything good.<eos> You don't think I feel bad enough already?<eos> I know I'm messed up... but you're supposed to teach me how not to be.<eos> You know how.<eos> Stop waiting for life to be easy. Stop hoping for somebody to save you.
You don't think I feel bad enough already?<eos> I know I'm messed up... but you're supposed to teach me how not to be.<eos> You know how.<eos> Stop waiting for life to be easy. Stop hoping for somebody to save you.<eos> You don't need another person lying to you.
The problem with treatment for some of these kids... is that we won't let them hit bottom.<eos> It's too hard to watch.<eos> But for Eli, the bottom is critical.<eos> How is there even less of you?<eos> What did that doctor do to you?
Hi, Mom.<eos> - Is this all you've got?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> All right.<eos> Well, everybody's waiting for you.
Hey, we got you!<eos> You know, there's always one.<eos> There's always one.<eos> You know, I don't care who you are, where you come from, or what you've done.<eos> If your journey has led you here, this is where it's gonna end.
Sorry.<eos> I should report you for making contact.<eos> You've been training six months.<eos> There's no excuse.<eos> You're just mad I knocked you on your ass.
Well, you refuse to answer my questions.<eos> Maybe he will.<eos> Hey.<eos> Does the master even exist?<eos> I'll say this one last time, the master will see you when you're ready.
Got the best food, the best girls.<eos> If we had a problem with another clan over a clipper patrol, my chieftain would send me in.<eos> Cut myself, killed the lot.<eos> Problem solved.<eos> It didn't bother you?
I'd rather go out using my power than hide up on this mountain like some coward.<eos> Don't you have anybody out there you care about?<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey, where you going?<eos> Hey, M.K., don't let them catch you.
What about me? Huh?<eos> You're gonna need me.<eos> In the ass crack of the outlying territory.<eos> No way you're making it out alone.<eos> There's no way I'm taking you.
The ghost orchid.<eos> One so rare, people crawled through miles of swamp just for a glimpse of its beauty.<eos> What we possessed was far more beautiful.<eos> More special.<eos> I already told you, I don't want my Gift back.
- M.K. M.K.!<eos> - Let him go.<eos> You got what you wanted.<eos> Now you're going to translate it for me.<eos> If this book holds all the Gifts' secrets, one of them must tell you how to get it back.
Well, you're gonna find out...<eos> Or you're gonna die trying.<eos> That's deep enough.<eos> You don't have to do this.<eos> This will ease you on your journey.
Where's M.K. now?<eos> With her.<eos> Then you're gonna help me get him back.<eos> No!<eos> I told you what he did to those Cogs, he's evil.
- Sounds good in Spanish, too.<eos> - Yes, man.<eos> You'll like being a father, Bear.<eos> Gives you ballast.<eos> - Keeps you upright through the storm.
No!<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey!<eos> - What did he say to you?
The women and girls...<eos> They will wish they had never lived at all.<eos> _<eos> Those men outside...<eos> They saw you on TV.
Come back in 10 years.<eos> I can't believe you just did that.<eos> - Where's your mother?<eos> - Working, okay?<eos> God, I hate you!
There are five guards.<eos> Maybe 15 shooters.<eos> I heard them talking.<eos> They're afraid of you.<eos> When their leader comes, they will kill you.
Ha ha ha ha. I'm fucking with you, man.<eos> Wow. Heh. You...<eos> You really like to cut it close, don't you?<eos> I assume you have something for me.<eos> Jesus Christ, what happened to you?
Raise to 40,000.<eos> - I'm out.<eos> - Folds.<eos> Call.<eos> See how that flop treated you.
Why don't you tell me what it is, honey?<eos> If I'd have listened to you, Marius, I'd have lost all my money, hmm?<eos> But of course that was the plan, wasn't it?<eos> Feeding me the cards. Wasn't it?<eos> Hmm? What I want from you now is to finally drop the con and admit... that I fucking got you.
What?<eos> [taxi door opens]<eos> No.<eos> No. It's always been me and you our whole lives.<eos> And look where that's gotten you.
And look where that's gotten you.<eos> Look, I don't blame you for any of this...<eos> But you should. I'm the one who got you into it.<eos> - That's not true.<eos> - I always get you into it.
She punched me in the nose.<eos> And I had it coming.<eos> That's why I left for AB.<eos> It was just going to be too weird.<eos> She's devoted to you, Otto.
This is boko haram we're talking about.<eos> They're gonna wrap this guy in goodyears and torch him.<eos> Special soldier!<eos> Those men outside...<eos> They saw you on TV.
- Every day is an easy day.<eos> - Hoo-yah. - Okay.<eos> Not you.<eos> Pull that shit one more time.<eos> Put doubt in a teammate's mind, and see if I don't ride you out of this goddamn program.
Go!<eos> Hey, Esther.<eos> Esther, come here.<eos> Come here.<eos> When they take you to the bathroom, where do they take you?
Ask to go to the bathroom, and I want you to look for a fire on the horizon, a black smoke.<eos> I want you to remember where that is when you walk back here, okay?<eos> Esther.<eos> Come here.<eos> Na'omi, what happened to you doesn't matter.
Sometimes it's important to look the men under your command in the eye... To build trust and respect.<eos> Of course, emir muttaqi.<eos> Insha'Allah.<eos> Michael... We've all lost loved ones to the Americans in this war.<eos> We're all burning with the holy fire of vengeance, but I don't want this seal to distract you from our goal.
She wrote her name in it.<eos> She was reading that to her schoolkids the year the Titanic went down.<eos> Damn.<eos> And Mom read it to me.<eos> I read it to you.
- That's right.<eos> No matter who, no matter what reasons you think you might have, you must not... you cannot tell anyone.<eos> There could be terrible consequences... life-changing consequences.<eos> And we don't want you to get into trouble.<eos> If something were to happen to you because of this, I'd feel sick about it.
That's the man that killed my brother.<eos> No.<eos> No. No!<eos> I want him.<eos> But I don't want this SEAL to distract you from our goal.
It's all arranged.<eos> The meeting with Boko Haram is a go.<eos> Come on.<eos> Let's pray, brother.<eos> What took you so long?
If we do not get $10 million in one week, I will cut his head off.<eos> We identified an abandoned village, which we believe may be where the hostages are being held.<eos> But I don't want this seal to distract you from our goal.
My brother... Omar.<eos> He was a good kid.<eos> From Detroit, remember?<eos> He loved the Lakers because of Kobe.<eos> That's what he told you...
Can I trust you to keep it together?<eos> Look me in the eye and tell me I can trust you.<eos> You can trust me.<eos> Good.<eos> Your team supports you, and so do I.
This is Michael's handwriting.<eos> Swan was his calling card.<eos> He's reaching out to us.<eos> But why is he being so mysterious?<eos> Back in the day, he never talked to you straight, as in
You are being targeted.<eos> - I'm a no one.<eos> - You are government to them.<eos> You don't understand being a Yemeni.<eos> You would run away when she needs you the most?
Sara?<eos> Sara!<eos> I figure we got a day, maybe two, tops, to get out of this hole.<eos> At that point, either the shelling gets us... or ISIL does.<eos> Does any of this phase you at all?
What am I looking at?<eos> Footage captured by a hunter four years ago.<eos> One of those motion sensor devices you hang on trees, takes intermittent photos of prey.<eos> Hunter comes out one morning, finds these images.<eos> This is the killing I was telling you about.
My ace in the hole.<eos> Yeah, sure, okay.<eos> See, in game theory, it serves you to be two-faced.<eos> Be everyone's friend till the moment you're not.<eos> You make them love you so much that when they're up against it, their loyalty will make them act against their own best interests.
Leaving his family, and-and the new identity.<eos> According to the little you've told me, he was different.<eos> Always an agenda, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I mean, he apparently loved you.
According to the little you've told me, he was different.<eos> Always an agenda, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I mean, he apparently loved you.<eos> Of course he loved you.
Hmm?<eos> An honest man doesn't try to escape.<eos> He asks for a lawyer.<eos> But you, you tried to escape the very first week.<eos> I'd have left you in solitary forever if it was up to me.
Forgive me, uh...<eos> Their parents have been killed.<eos> I'm trying to figure out how I can help them.<eos> They can stay here for now.<eos> As long as you tell me who you know in Ogygia, and why they want you so bad.
But even if it is just within these walls, the law of the land is still in place.<eos> The law of God supersedes the law of this corrupt land.<eos> We will not be reduced to animals.<eos> Amazing you still trust him.<eos> He will use you for the escape and he will leave you.
He has told you something about the escape.<eos> I know he has.<eos> You were in the cell with him.<eos> You.<eos> You tell me, so I can help you, before he uses you to get that devil out and we are all left here to die.
There's a difference.<eos> We got to act like we're on his side until the moment we're not.<eos> But what if you're acting like you're on my side till the moment you're not?<eos> You are getting paranoid.<eos> Yeah, well, four years in the box is gonna do that to you.
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> I told you, Ramal's not going anywhere.
Doesn't matter.<eos> They're leaving.<eos> I am not the bad guy here.<eos> You and I have a history.<eos> How I doted on you in grade school, how I waited and I waited.
And it's the same with this one.<eos> You know, we trump you up as Kaniel Outis, big international terrorist.<eos> It's just a name, it's just a rap sheet, it's a way to get you locked up.<eos> Right?<eos> I guess what I'm asking you is did... did something happen to you while you were in solitary?
And you lied to me.<eos> By God and my armies of the caliphate, you will die for it.<eos> Maybe even tomorrow.<eos> Sara...<eos> I'm putting you in danger by saying this, but maybe it doesn't matter because I'll be dead, and they'll leave you alone.
That's when I saw that the basement door was open, so I went down there.<eos> What did you see?<eos> Um... I just heard a... mm...<eos> A noise coming from upstairs, and then I woke up here.<eos> When Professor Keating called you, did she say why she wanted you at the house?
Sooner you get over it the better.<eos> Ahh. See, it's easy.<eos> It's no different than you alone in what I'm guessing is some big ol', fancy crib...<eos> Bitch, will you just leave her be?<eos> Or do I need to drown you in your own piss?
Or do I need to drown you in your own piss?<eos> So, you admit going to talk to Ms. Keating in her holding cell, and this is just an hour after you talked to the Medical Examiner?<eos> Due to our prior relationship, I felt she might disclose key evidence for us.<eos> To be clear, you did this on your own.<eos> No one in this office cleared you to do that?
Frank.<eos> I don't want him anywhere near this.<eos> He's not.<eos> I promise.<eos> I'm gonna get you out of here.
Hit me!<eos> - Asher!<eos> Get off!<eos> Get off of him!<eos> Asher, what is wrong with you?
You don't seem that sad.<eos> I'm sad.<eos> I'm just not crying about it every second like you.<eos> Okay, but what about when your mom left?<eos> That clearly hurt you...
Hannah Keating called the police at 10:30 that night.<eos> It was after the fire started.<eos> I don't know how she could have found out about it so soon unless she knew it was going to happen.<eos> Or she was working with the Mahoneys.<eos> It seems insane, I know, but she's always wanted the house, and she'd know that hurting Wes would hurt you.
Because you think she did it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Oli, you got to go to the police.<eos> - No.<eos> - You can tell them that you cleared her phone because she threatened you.
And now you're dead to her.<eos> You know that.<eos> Otherwise, you'd have hurt me by now.<eos> But you're not gonna.<eos> Because you know she would never forgive you for it.
Did Frank confess?<eos> Who told you that?<eos> Just tell me.<eos> Yes.<eos> Who told you?
You got me on candid camera.<eos> What's so hard?<eos> You're lying for Annalise.<eos> And I understand why.<eos> She's controlled you for quite a long time.
Hey, I'm talking to you!<eos> Annalise had nothing to do with this.<eos> Of course she did.<eos> She loved that kid.<eos> No, she told you to be a good little soldier and take the fall for her.
What is it?<eos> You can fix this.<eos> Give me all your 9s.<eos> Go fish.<eos> What the hell happened to you?
I saw Frank last week.<eos> I told him I was pregnant.<eos> And that it was Wes'.<eos> I would have never told him if I ever thought he would hurt Wes.<eos> Did Annalise put you up to this?
And that it was Wes'.<eos> I would have never told him if I ever thought he would hurt Wes.<eos> Did Annalise put you up to this?<eos> I haven't talked to Annalise since the fire.<eos> And Bonnie... she never visited you in the hospital?
Where?<eos> In the basement.<eos> He ran out of the storm door.<eos> He did this.<eos> Annalise uses you.
And?<eos> They charged him as your co-conspirator.<eos> I thought that I could do this, Annalise.<eos> I really did.<eos> I thought... that this would get you out.
It's not a crosswalk, genius!<eos> Why are they questioning Wes?<eos> Is it because of Annalise's investigation?<eos> I said I'm not doing this here.<eos> If she goes down, she's gonna take you with her.
Point being, we're here now.<eos> For as long as it takes to get you out.<eos> No.<eos> I've never seen you quite so low, baby.<eos> And who but your family can lift you up out of this mess, hmm?
Ophelia...<eos> I'll tell them that I made sure all the kids was out of the house.<eos> And then I poured hooch all over the couch that Clyde was on.<eos> Mama, stop.<eos> They got to know what that pervert did to you.
They already know how much of a disappointment you are.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - They probably celebrated when you were hauled off to jail, relieved that they didn't have to deal with your cracked-out mess anymore.<eos> Shut your mouth.<eos> They don't love you.
- Leave.<eos> Lahey here.<eos> Gibbins walked out on us. You know anything about that?<eos> Why would I?<eos> You were standing outside of his interrogation room the last time I saw you, so...
We don't know that.<eos> The D.A. really wants to take me down for this.<eos> And I would imagine that anything that they offered would be hard to turn down.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I'm sorry. Did you really call us here to beg us not to tattle on you?
Well, then, there's your answer.<eos> Oliver, what if she's hiding something?<eos> Then I think we should respect her wishes, and let it stay hidden.<eos> Is that why you saved a copy?<eos> Because I think you did because your gut's telling you that Annalise is being sketchy.
- Your signature is on that form.<eos> You were gonna be investigated either way.<eos> Not by the State!<eos> You seriously think this lady's gonna charge her own prosecutor?<eos> She will once she finds out they're setting you up.
You dig when I tell you not to.<eos> You ask questions about things you can't understand.<eos> This proves they killed Wes.<eos> No, what it proves is, you don't listen.<eos> What did I tell you about these people?
No, I think you're being paranoid.<eos> And you're being naive.<eos> Okay, I'm being naive.<eos> And yet, here I am, going through her phone records because you wanted me to.<eos> By the way, you never told me that she called you over to the house that night.
No naked Nate pics, huh?<eos> Straight people are so boring.<eos> You can all stop stalking me.<eos> It's not like I'm gonna go crazy or anything.<eos> No one would blame you if you did.
Here he goes again.<eos> - Stop.<eos> - Stop what?<eos> Why don't you say "Hi" to your buddy Atwood over there?<eos> You could thank her for the deal she got you.
So, Atwood's working with the Mahoneys, like I said.<eos> It's possible.<eos> It's true.<eos> We shouldn't jump to any conclusions right now.<eos> What happened to you in there?
I've been busy.<eos> Busy ratting us out to the fuzz?<eos> Would I be here if I did?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe they put a wire on you.
You're gonna go, and you're gonna kill yourself, Connor!<eos> Today's a good day for you.<eos> How's that?<eos> We're offering you a plea deal.<eos> Admit Annalise ordered you to kill Wes, and you'll be out in seven years.
You could've kept Annalise out of jail.<eos> How?<eos> By telling the police that she wasn't at the house that night.<eos> That doesn't mean she didn't do this.<eos> Bonnie told you, right?
By telling the police that she wasn't at the house that night.<eos> That doesn't mean she didn't do this.<eos> Bonnie told you, right?<eos> This whole time, I've been telling everyone that you killed Wes.<eos> You should be begging her not to kill you right now, not attacking her.
You couldn't stand the idea of spending one second alone.<eos> You don't know anything about me.<eos> Well, I know you're paranoid and broken, haven't trusted anyone since you were a little boy.<eos> I know what you're trying to do right now.<eos> And you're still acting like that little boy, making up ugly stories about people because you're scared of anyone actually getting to know you.
Please step up, Ms. Castillo.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> You know why.<eos> Tell me or I'll call 911 right now.<eos> How long have the Mahoneys been paying you off?
You know why.<eos> Tell me or I'll call 911 right now.<eos> How long have the Mahoneys been paying you off?<eos> The Mahoneys?<eos> Then who asked you to cremate Wes' body?
Atwood went to New York for a job interview.<eos> And you believe her?<eos> Now I don't know if I believe you.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> After everything I've done to you, said to you...
I'm gonna call, and Sylvia or Charles or one of the Mahoneys are gonna pick up, and then we're gonna find out how stupid your plan is.<eos> No, yo plan is stupid!<eos> - I'm calling.<eos> - Tell him to hang up.<eos> Like, what is wrong with you?
What?<eos> You lost him?<eos> You lost him after he discovered the burner phone you used to frame my client.<eos> That's a good story.<eos> Be careful who catches you in here.
Until you finally get that you're wrong!<eos> - I need you guys to sit down.<eos> - What is that supposed to mean?<eos> - I'm sorry. I raided your fridge.<eos> - Think about the amount of times that he's lied to you... When he cheated on you, when he chopped up Sam's body into little pieces.
- What I've done?<eos> - Do you want me to sit here in the middle of this restaurant and list them off?<eos> I lived through the terror you and your husband enacted on me once already.<eos> I'm not here to do it again.<eos> - That we enacted on you?
Wes Gibbins' phone.<eos> You had it this whole time?<eos> Or we found it in your car when we brought you into custody, proving that you killed Wes.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> Do the Mahoneys have something on you?
There's no way I could live with myself, so just...<eos> Please, come home.<eos> He was scared... as was I.<eos> And I didn't want the police to hear him confessing.<eos> Or you didn't want them to hear how it incriminated you.
Did it... Did it not work?<eos> My God.<eos> - I was so worried about you.<eos> - I know.<eos> I thought something awful happened to you.
- No, we won't!<eos> - We're gonna confront him there.<eos> - No, I can't.<eos> - This is for Wes. - No, it's for you, and I'm sorry, but you're not the only one who knows what love is here.<eos> I think I love you, too.
Thing that mystifies me equally is seven years ago, you exonerated Michael, Lincoln, all of them, except me.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yes!<eos> That's why you're here?<eos> Because I didn't exonerate you?
"Was" is the key word.<eos> I'm a man moving toward the light now, and the light's beckoning me.<eos> I just don't know who's pulling the strings.<eos> But Sara says it's you.<eos> Oh, Sara put you onto me?
You can't pull them.<eos> This side is original.<eos> They're open, loose.<eos> You want me to free you?<eos> Yes, and I, in turn, free you with those keys, down there.
And then the lie has to kill the truth.<eos> Which one of you is gonna die ne...?<eos> Time to get scarce.<eos> Hey!<eos> What did he say to you?
Please don't do this.<eos> You will lose.<eos> Listen to your friend.<eos> I'm talking to you, Ramal.<eos> I told you!
Would you all give us the room for a moment?<eos> Seventeen years.<eos> Eighteen in July, actually.<eos> All those years we built this place together.<eos> And all that time I've supported you... looked up to you, deferred to you.
I'll make you something.<eos> Be right back.<eos> Just finish that.<eos> Hey.<eos> I said I'd bring it to you.
You're in so much pain.<eos> Why are you putting yourself through all this?<eos> - 'Cause I wanted to tell you...<eos> - That you have regrets.<eos> And I'm telling you don't bother.
I don't doubt your emotions are real... but what's the point of all the sad faces and the gnashing of teeth?<eos> If you're not going to change your behavior, and you won't...<eos> - I can change...<eos> - why not just skip the whole exercise?<eos> In the end, you're gonna hurt everyone around you.
I stuck my nose in where it didn't belong and I stirred the pot.<eos> So....<eos> Look, if you wanna blame someone... you should blame me.<eos> Jimmy, you're a good friend.<eos> She doesn't deserve you.
- I signed them from her.<eos> - Nice.<eos> They saw right through it.<eos> "Oh, Jimmy, you're too nice.<eos> Jimmy, she doesn't deserve you."
Hi, excuse me.<eos> Can I get an old-fashioned?<eos> - What kind of bourbon?<eos> - Uh, Bulleit?<eos> She just... she doesn't treat you right.
Karen?<eos> I'd do it Julie's way, if I dared.<eos> I don't think that's the answer you're supposed to give, Karen, love.<eos> Look, if we tell you you're talking bollocks, do we still get our certificates?<eos> Still don't know why they put you on t'course, Julie.
Goose eggs?<eos> You're putting it off.<eos> You're doing it wrong. It's a bird, not a bloody brick!<eos> Anyway, you should be inside getting on with your homework.<eos> Suppose truancy officer sees you?
I'm only down t'road.<eos> I've had no dinner, no tea.<eos> Well, where's Tiffany?<eos> Out.<eos> There's nowt to stop you from making your own tea, you know.
Not been out of t'house for ages.<eos> I know love.<eos> But it's been a week now, it's really important we show Shannon's not forgotten, and to have you there at t'front of march will make such a difference.<eos> Come on, love, be brave.<eos> Whole estate's waiting for you.
She does.<eos> Our message to the world is, we won't give up till Shannon's found.<eos> Our message to Shannon is, we're looking forward to you being back home safe, love.<eos> There's a message attached to every one of these balloons that says so.<eos> So here's hoping one of 'em will reach you.
Yeah, you have, you were at me dad's funeral, and so were he.<eos> I don't remember that.<eos> Well, that's funny cos at piss-up after, you were sat on his knee.<eos> You what?<eos> I never wor! I saw you!
I've got it - a tree for Shannon!<eos> Bloody mint idea, Julie!<eos> Thanks, Julie, I love you!<eos> Right, Michael, can we go through this again, please?<eos> What exactly did Karen ask you to do?
Thanks, Julie, I love you!<eos> Right, Michael, can we go through this again, please?<eos> What exactly did Karen ask you to do?<eos> She said I were to look after Shannon... and then she'd report her missing.<eos> She actually said that to you?
She said I had to do what she said and if I told anyone else about it I'd be dead.<eos> So now you're saying she threatened you'd be killed?<eos> By these same three lads?<eos> Karen Matthews making death threats?<eos> Does that ring true to you?
So now you're saying she threatened you'd be killed?<eos> By these same three lads?<eos> Karen Matthews making death threats?<eos> Does that ring true to you?<eos> What did she actually tell you to do with Shannon?
Well, they can ask all they bloody like!<eos> No need t'get narky wi' us!<eos> I'm not!<eos> You are, Mum!<eos> It's us that's backed you up right through all this.
Even though you've hardly done owt for us ever since it all kicked off.<eos> You what?<eos> That's bloody cobblers!<eos> It's true, it's been Shannon, Shannon, Shannon, ever since it all kicked off!<eos> We've hardly seen you.
I don't know.<eos> Well, if police haven't got her to admit she's doing owt wrong, maybe there's nowt to admit to?<eos> You don't really believe that, Julie.<eos> Or you wouldn't have come round here.<eos> I think it's eating away at you just as much as it is me.
It were all for nowt...<eos> It weren't for nowt, Julie.<eos> You stuck up for this place.<eos> You made people think again about what we're really like.<eos> Folk admired you for it.
We shouldn't even be talking about this.<eos> Get off me!<eos> How are you alive? !<eos> In Yemen? !<eos> What happened to you, Michael?
Sorry.<eos> Uh, hi, Andrew.<eos> I'm Sara Scofield.<eos> Thanks for taking the time.<eos> By any chance, did my husband Jacob Ness ask you to work on my cell phone?
I don't even know why you dragged me into all this, you know?<eos> You got to forget the past, Whip, the details.<eos> None of that matters now.<eos> What have my actions been all these years?<eos> Who's been taking care of you through everything, huh?
We can trust him?<eos> No. But he's our last option.<eos> You made bail. You're being released.<eos> Don't be a stranger, sugar.<eos> Poseidon got you out first.
Get this off of me.<eos> Hold your hand still.<eos> Just do it already.<eos> Do you want to stay like this?<eos> You're lucky we cut you loose.
Omar had to go somewhere safe.<eos> Because of the war?<eos> Yeah, the war.<eos> That's right.<eos> He told us to bring this stuff for you.
Michael's b negative, okay?<eos> It's maybe one percent of the population with that blood type.<eos> You won't find it where you're going, and he won't make it while you look.<eos> Unless it comes to you.<eos> I'll call you back.
Why did you come back now?<eos> The origami...<eos> Four years ago, he betrayed me and now I know why.<eos> He wanted me out of the way... So he could have you.<eos> How did he betray you?
My man, you got more lives than anyone.<eos> Think I might've used them all up.<eos> Sucre: A damn Phoenix.<eos> I can't believe it.<eos> I want to hear every damn thing that's happened to you since you died.
He runs a splinter cell called 21-Void.<eos> He targeted me for my skills.<eos> Michael, he's with our son right now.<eos> I'll get to the States as soon as I can.<eos> Did my husband, Jacob Ness, ask you to work on my cell phone?
- Doesn't make it right.<eos> Don't act like you're suddenly a fan of the status quo, okay?<eos> The system, it's slow, stupid, and doomed to fail.<eos> That's why you had to bust your brother out in the first place.<eos> New ink since the last time I saw you.
You've been a warrior, and I owe you.<eos> But your face is a liability now to you and your family.<eos> I don't want you to risk that.<eos> They may know his face, but they don't know mine.<eos> It's the punch you don't see coming that knocks you out.
! I want you to be with your family, look after the refugees.<eos> Linc, I'm a part of this fight, too...<eos> What was that?<eos> It's good-bye.<eos> I could never forgive myself if something happened to you.
A man drawn into this by destiny.<eos> Okay. How about you take off?<eos> I don't exactly cotton to strange men coming up to me in the middle of the night, you know?<eos> Only one person calls me Whip... you ain't him.<eos> Nobody calls you that.
Mama needs a shower.<eos> What are you looking at?<eos> Nice catch, boy.<eos> Thanks, Mr. Kox.<eos> I thought I told you to mop the fucking floor.
So did I.<eos> So what about you and Grace?<eos> It's... Complicated.<eos> I know all about that.<eos> Does she make you wear the cock chain when she's spanking you?
- What of it?<eos> I spoke with my partner.<eos> Heart Enterprises owns Kane Hill Hospital.<eos> What?<eos> The same people that put you on the race own the asylum where your sister is living.
If you're sleeping okay. If you still have anxiety.<eos> Yes, but I need you to try harder.<eos> You can't cancel within a 24-hour window.<eos> Hi, Greg.<eos> Does 2:00 p.m. on Friday work for you?
You're getting slower.<eos> - Sprinter versus long distance.<eos> No, I-I thought I saw something.<eos> It was probably a deer.<eos> Have I told you how glad I am that you're back?
It's the only thing I'm good at.<eos> Well, that's absurd.<eos> He's not dangerous, he's just hurt.<eos> I'm already helping him.<eos> Well, what is it doing to you?
How?<eos> I don't know how.<eos> He just did, okay?<eos> - Ernie told me.<eos> - Ernie told you?
He just did, okay?<eos> - Ernie told me.<eos> - Ernie told you?<eos> He said Chuck has a tape recorder wrapped in a space blanket in his desk drawer.<eos> Ernie was putting new batteries in it, for Chuck... and the tape rolled for a few seconds and he heard you.
You piece of shit!<eos> "Oh, my brain used to work. "I'm sick.<eos> I don't know what to do."<eos> Asshole!<eos> No wonder Rebecca left you.
We all begin at a certain point, and finally we get used to using our other senses.<eos> I guess my spider senses have not kicked in again yet.<eos> A joke.<eos> She pulled a joke.<eos> I knew I could break you in the end.
Pixels, it's not brain physics.<eos> Check this out.<eos> Please turn on voice speaking.<eos> -Okay. Now then?<eos> -Now Read it all up for you.
Are you ready to go?<eos> I must go.<eos> Okay.<eos> Come here, girl.<eos> See you later.
Then it was decided.<eos> -Good.<eos> -Apple, Welcome to the family.<eos> I guess she stops.<eos> I love you already.
-Yes.<eos> -I love it.<eos> Who could have imagined?<eos> Who knew?<eos> I love you too.
Hello, Sara Beth.<eos> Hello, Mrs. Andrews. Is Bailey at home?<eos> I do not think it fits so well right now.<eos> Hello, Sara Beth.<eos> I did not know what happened to you!
- No, you do not.<eos> - I'm doing it. -No. - I'm doing it.<eos> -No.<eos> I will learn braille to end.<eos> And then I will have already told you.
If it punctures the chamber...<eos> We're more or less fucked.<eos> Our escort ship isn't responding.<eos> Errinwright must've covered that, too.<eos> He delivered you to the enemy like a Christmas present.
I reinforced all the seals to the machine shop.<eos> Soon as we're done here, we're onto the next deck.<eos> Okay.<eos> Amos.<eos> About what I did to you on Ganymede.
No one's always right.<eos> I'm sorry I hurt you.<eos> When you said Holden could survive this, you were lying.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Do not blow the hatch until I tell you to.
Revenge is the last thing I'm thinking about now.<eos> We're not right.<eos> - We are.<eos> - We're not.<eos> So unless you can see how to get you out safe, and get that thing off our ship, don't talk to me.
The man you serve here.<eos> Does he deserve your sacrifice?<eos> I'm an electrician.<eos> You're about to lay down your life for an unworthy master.<eos> That's not an honorable death, no matter what they tell you.
Yeah, but I don't have anybody coming in here asking to buy 'em.<eos> Because they don't think you have one, asshole.<eos> Mikey, I got guys coming in here wanting protection from sheet holders, or car jackers, or an ex.<eos> What in the fuck are they gonna do with a stun grenade?<eos> Tell you what, man.
How's school?<eos> It's fine, I guess.<eos> How's your grades?<eos> Pretty good.<eos> How's your mom treating you?
No, Mikey, don't eat yet.<eos> Lizzie wanted to say the prayer.<eos> Mikey, come on.<eos> You're a caveman.<eos> And no one wants you here.
- No.<eos> What do I do?<eos> What do I do?<eos> You gotta face it.<eos> The police aren't going to help you here.
I need that money by tomorrow, or that's exactly where you're going.<eos> You know something, Mikey?<eos> I know something you don't know, and that's that you're lucky.<eos> You wanna know why?<eos> Because tomorrow when we do the exchange, you get to find out how much your brother really loves you.
I hate both of you.<eos> You're so lucky 'cause you had each other!<eos> Well, that's the King brothers.<eos> That's why I can expect something different from you.<eos> Jesus, man, I did that to you?
- No.<eos> I'm still stuck on this arcade thing.<eos> I don't think that meant anything, man.<eos> - He said, "On me."<eos> - Where does that lead you?
- Jeanie.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Hey, we missed you the other night.<eos> Oh, yeah, I was bummed I couldn't make it.<eos> I'm shocked the "desperate housewives" kept you out so late.
I'll stay.<eos> - Staying, too.<eos> - Really?<eos> You gotta be kidding me.<eos> But you raised your eyebrows. - No, I know you think that's my tell, but it's called outsmarting you.
I was actually just stopping by for a quick coffee.<eos> I have to get back to work.<eos> Don't writers work in coffee shops?<eos> Not all types.<eos> You want me to take you on a tour?
I don't know, the whole time I just kept thinking...<eos> I can't believe we ever dated.<eos> So why do you see him at all? Play with his feelings like that?<eos> I mean, you're obviously aware that you're alluring and charming.<eos> Maybe he's still in love with you.
- I think that's called lying.<eos> - Semantics.<eos> You're like a human Rorschach.<eos> How's that?<eos> You want people to look at you and see what their fantasy is, don't you?
No one.<eos> Just a friend.<eos> Okay, come on, let's go to sleep.<eos> - I love you.<eos> - I love you too, Mommy.
- Okay.<eos> - I'm not tripping still, am I?<eos> - You tell me.<eos> I'm not.<eos> - Oh, that looks cute on you.
Hey...<eos> Everybody, just back off!<eos> Mom.<eos> - My sweet girl!<eos> - I never thought I'd see you again.
I want to use our rune.<eos> I just need your magic for the pain.<eos> - I can't help you with this.<eos> - Why not?<eos> The last time you used a rune to track Jace, it almost killed you.
You told me I never had a mother.<eos> What did you want me to say?<eos> That I saved you and that your mother deserted you?<eos> - What?<eos> - She left you to die in Idris.
You need to forget Jace.<eos> He made his choice.<eos> Do you even hear what you're saying?<eos> If you kill him, you kill a part of me.<eos> When you have a cancer, you cut it out before it destroys you.
I don't even know where to start.<eos> You think there'd be some sort of handbook for the Shadow World, like...<eos> Shadowhunting for Dummies.<eos> Clary!<eos> - Thank God I found you.
Shadowhunting for Dummies.<eos> Clary!<eos> - Thank God I found you.<eos> - Let me guess.<eos> Luke called you.
You were right.<eos> When I called off my wedding, that was for me.<eos> But this is all just...<eos> It's very new.<eos> This may surprise you, but you're new for me, too.
I might have broken the Accords, but I know you won't.<eos> You don't know anything about me.<eos> I know you're weak.<eos> I can smell it.<eos> And you'll do whatever the Clave tells you to do.
Call it an intense dislike.<eos> So why are you helping me?<eos> I don't know.<eos> The pain... It's everywhere.<eos> What did you think yin fen would do to you?
I'm very versatile.<eos> In a way that makes my skin crawl.<eos> I thought we would understand each other.<eos> Both scientists in our own right.<eos> I applaud your spirit, but it won't help you.
You do have exotic taste, don't you?<eos> Oh, the Spanish theme is in honor of you and your husband.<eos> Really?<eos> How so?<eos> Alec told me that Robert proposed to you in Barcelona.
But then...<eos> Vampire venom is more powerful than yin fen.<eos> It also wears off quicker.<eos> That's why it was a one-time deal.<eos> Thought I made that clear to you.
About me and Magnus.<eos> Max doesn't have any idea what's going on between your father and me.<eos> Then what is it?<eos> I didn't want to burden you all...<eos> Is Dad cheating on you?
I'm talking about the Downworlders.<eos> Jace, you didn't know.<eos> Wasn't your fault.<eos> I never said it was.<eos> Come on, you got another round in you or Startin' to get tired?
Jace, you didn't know.<eos> Wasn't your fault.<eos> I never said it was.<eos> Come on, you got another round in you or Startin' to get tired?<eos> So what does this pure angel blood do for you anyway?
Uh, can I at least keep the band name?<eos> Rock Solid Panda?<eos> Hello?<eos> Maureen?<eos> Hello? I didn't think I'd see you here.
How did you get in here anyway?<eos> I drove. Outside?<eos> In the sun?<eos> How?<eos> What did Valentine do to you?
I'm not sure I would trust me either if I were you, but the longer Azazel has Isabelle, the greater the chance she dies.<eos> We don't have a choice, Jace.<eos> This better not be a trap.<eos> Your life is on the line too.<eos> Clarissa I would never do anything to hurt you.
Other than feeling like a total failure great.<eos> How did you do it?<eos> You activated a rune without your stelae.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Saw you lying there.
- want the medallion?<eos> - "Legion of Doom"?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Don't ask.<eos> Well, according to legend, the medallion calls for the spear and basically takes you right to it.
Instead of being killed, he's supposed to go on to invent a new carburetor for shovelhead motorcycles.<eos> As far as aberrations go, don't you think that's a bit...<eos> Puny?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, Gideon was going over autopsy reports, and, well, I'll just let her tell you. Gideon?
- Well, where is it?<eos> - In the movie?<eos> It... It's in pieces.<eos> Rip just has a fragment of it.<eos> What inspired you to write it that way?
I seem to remember Eobard mentioning how he was going to punish your failure.<eos> If anyone's a failure, it's you.<eos> You were the one who learned about Hunter's secret account, yet seem not to know about a passcode.<eos> Sloppy, Damien.<eos> No wonder they passed you over for Ra's...
I've seen how pathetic you are.<eos> In this future that you're from, do I at least have two hands?<eos> Either way, I intend to change my future, but look at you now.<eos> You're pathetic.<eos> I don't even know why Thawne recruited you in the first place.
They're at the bank.<eos> Look, you could help yourself to... to whatever is in that safe deposit box, but please...<eos> Please, just...<eos> Just let me go, man. Let me go.<eos> Does this look like a spear to you?
I will give you a day.<eos> MOONEY: I thought we were friends.<eos> When the Court of Owls calls, o-one does not refuse.<eos> Still, I'm not upset.<eos> I knew when your old masters summoned you, it was to cook up some horror, and here's the thing:
Not like this.<eos> Well... (cork squeaks) ...this is the only way, Jim.<eos> Just listen to the whispers.<eos> (ears ringing, heart beating) GORDON (whispers): Killer.<eos> They'll lead you to me, tell you who you are.
Right. Find Bullock, let him know where we are.<eos> I'm gonna follow Bruce.<eos> MALE VOICE: I wouldn't touch that, Bruce.<eos> You know who I am?<eos> MALE VOICE: Who do you think told the Sensei to send you here?
That's the mother of all insults.<eos> The city is gonna pay us a lot of money to get Tetch back.<eos> We need to let that play out before we do anything rash.<eos> I know you two are close.<eos> But whatever you had, she treats you like dirt now.
Is it weird that kind of makes me like her?<eos> You thinking about ripping anyone's head off, Jim?<eos> I bet you are.<eos> You're so close.<eos> The next time you give in, the virus will have you.
GILZEAN: Regroup?<eos> For what?<eos> ! For whatever the hell I tell you to do!<eos> (door opens, closes) I'm not waiting anymore.<eos> She's broken every promise she's ever made to you...
Instead of killing me when you had the chance, you've decided to feed your ego.<eos> (chuckles): You want to talk ego?<eos> Riddler?<eos> You will always fail, Oswald.<eos> Because you will always let your base emotions drive you.
If it wasn't for her,<eos> Gordon would have turned me over, and I'd most likely be dead.<eos> But fortune favors the bold.<eos> You said you called them after you knocked me out.<eos> You knew that I'd bring you here.
A chance to remember who we can be rather than who we are.<eos> I don't know if Gotham deserves saving, but I do know one thing.<eos> If anyone can save it... it's you.<eos> And in return, I believe it can save you as well.<eos> And then maybe one day, it will send you back to me.
Get her.<eos> - We can't outrun them.<eos> - No, we can't.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm the reason Savitar found you.
Look at me.<eos> We're gonna help you, okay?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Right.<eos> Well, since our guest here has both of our resident scientists hostage, what temporal problem can we help you with?
The only reason I agreed was because of H.R.<eos> H.R. needs your help.<eos> H.R. is dead.<eos> That's why you need to stay.<eos> Because of what Savitar took from you, because of what Savitar took from H.R... everything.
Love and hate, they're so close.<eos> It's easy to mistake one for the other.<eos> You're gonna spend the rest of your life with him.<eos> But I remember giving you the ring.<eos> Singing to you.
It's easy to mistake one for the other.<eos> You're gonna spend the rest of your life with him.<eos> But I remember giving you the ring.<eos> Singing to you.<eos> Asking you to marry me.
Yeah.<eos> What happened?<eos> What'd I miss?<eos> We'll talk about it later.<eos> The important thing is that you're back which they brought you back from and they just dropped you here.
Oliver, it's me--Laurel.<eos> Don't you say her name.<eos> I--I'm sorry.<eos> What I did was unforgivable, but--but he made me do it--prometheus.<eos> What do you mean he made you?
And what do you think?<eos> I think...<eos> You should get used to living in cages.<eos> There's a part of him that blames himself<eos> It's who he is, so when he looks at you... He doesn't just see Laurel.
You should get used to living in cages.<eos> There's a part of him that blames himself<eos> It's who he is, so when he looks at you... He doesn't just see Laurel.<eos> He sees a shot at redemption.<eos> Wow. It must be really frustrating that he doesn't listen to you.
No.<eos> We're gonna get justice for Billy.<eos> But first, we need to take care of your ex, who's not even your ex.<eos> There's a part of him that blames himself for Laurel's death.<eos> It's who he is, so when he looks at you, he sees more than just Laurel.
What makes me so special?<eos> If you stay in the same spot for more than a minute, and I'll get a chance to tell it.<eos> Well, if you're gonna make a sales pitch, make it good.<eos> You went through something traumatic.<eos> For the past 3 years, you've been trying to understand it because you're afraid of what happened to you and of what you've become, so you're running from it.
After 3 years, the man who killed my partner is finally in my sights.<eos> I'm not letting anyone get in my way.<eos> Lady wants to commit suicide, we should let her.<eos> Free country.<eos> He nearly killed you last time.
You don't even know me.<eos> I thought I'd proven otherwise.<eos> General Shreve, Baron Reiter, Konstantin Kovar.<eos> You keep looking for new fights when the real fight has been in front of you all along.<eos> Your father literally wrote it for you, a list of all the yurieviches and kovars in starling city.
Why do you deny your father's wish for you?<eos> You saw the reason tonight.<eos> I am not the man that my father raised!<eos> Not anymore.<eos> You're afraid of what's happened to you, of what you've become, and you're running from it.
Send her in, please.<eos> Mayor Queen.<eos> It's impressive.<eos> Maybe you should have led with that.<eos> I got to admit... I didn't think I'd see you again.
My real name is Dinah, Dinah Drake.<eos> Dinah?<eos> Does that name mean something to you?<eos> I had a friend named Dinah.<eos> She's the reason I sought you out.
I'll see you on the boat.<eos> I know where he's taking them.<eos> The name of the island they found me on is Lian Yu.<eos> It's mandarin for Purgatory.<eos> What brought you back to the island?
I--how can you miss somebody that you have hated so much?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I mean, I have some experience with evil dads, too.<eos> My father abandoned me, lied to me, and then took a bullet for me, saving my life.<eos> Malcolm was not a good person, and he was an even worse father, but in his own way, he loved you.
There's hundreds.<eos> Way too many to defuse.<eos> All right.<eos> Let's get out of here.<eos> I think Wilson did something to your head when he knocked you out.
You choose.<eos> Right now.<eos> Either way, it proves me right, huh?<eos> Either way, it's exactly like I told you.<eos> Everyone around you, everything you touch dies.
Stable and healthy, not at all adventurous.<eos> But I think that's why I found Sidney so alluring, because she was the exact opposite.<eos> Right, but she's also selfish and dangerous.<eos> From what you said.<eos> Finding someone who loves you for who you really are, at your best, at your worst, that's... that's true love.
Right, but it's a lot of pressure to put on anyone.<eos> After all, you didn't just lose a husband. Rebecca lost her dad.<eos> And I have a feeling that maybe... maybe there wasn't enough room for her grief with yours.<eos> Now, I know how complex the mother-daughter relationship can be, but as the mother, you sometimes have to take responsibility.<eos> You don't want it to get so bad that she doesn't return your calls or do anything real with you.
It was around my birthday.<eos> She stopped by to drop off a present, and we spoke for, like, a minute.<eos> And why are you so afraid to talk to her, Allison?<eos> Do you know that look? The one where the person you love most is completely disappointed in you?<eos> Or they no longer see you as their kid, but as an individual, and they don't like what they see?

- Oh, what? She's not.<eos> Okay, listen, she's attractive, fine.<eos> But even if I was on the hunt, she's young, and she feels young, okay?<eos> Good, 'cause if I lose you to your assistant,<eos> I'd be mad at you for making me part of the clich√©.
Your friends can't get there unless their parents drive them.<eos> - You're gonna be amazing... in Lowlands.<eos> - You're a great little actress... and you just pick one,<eos> - and we'll be behind you.<eos> Oh. Arya, they want you back on set, so we should probably get going.
- Randy, we're peeing.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Do these make me look cool?<eos> How about these?<eos> One of my goals is to take a more active role in decorating our apartment, if that's cool with you.
Thank you.<eos> Let everybody know.<eos> - All right, man.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> I hope this isn't weird, but, uh... did I see you in an episode of Homicide?
- She told you that?<eos> - No. I saw it. Or I heard it.<eos> Dude, you're in my house.<eos> You're always in my fuckin' house.<eos> How much money did she give you?
Like him.<eos> Why do I know him?<eos> Okay.<eos> I see where you're coming from.<eos> I get how it'd be a bummer for you, okay?
Or... you could tell them.<eos> I don't know, 'cause I kind of feel like if you did it, it'd be a good learning experience.<eos> You'd learn how to fight your own battles.<eos> I don't need that experience.<eos> Come on, I'm paying you.
- Bertie, Bertie, what's up?<eos> - Hey, how are you?<eos> - How you doin'?<eos> - I'm good.<eos> They stuck you with the popcorn?
- Bertie, you're a total pushover.<eos> - I'm not a pushover!<eos> I mean it in a good way.<eos> That's why we like you.<eos> You... you do what people ask you to.
Okay.<eos> That's enough.<eos> The point is she's a fucking user, Gus.<eos> Mickey used me to keep her job.<eos> She is using you.
- Yeah, I feel really sad.<eos> - Yeah, me too.<eos> - Hey!<eos> - Hey.<eos> Finally ran into you.
But you and I weren't even dating then, so I don't get why you're mad at me.<eos> 'Cause he said, like, everything I'm, like, worried might be true.<eos> I don't know.<eos> What?<eos> What... what did he say to you?
- Hi. - Don't step there.<eos> - Oh, shit.<eos> - I gotta sweep that up.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> Hey, did you notice last night, there was a point where I was spooning you and then you were spooning Grandpa?
- Oh, shit.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Hey, Dad!<eos> - Hey, kiddo! How are ya?<eos> Aw. Man, you're even skinnier than the last time I saw you.
Mickey, you little scamp.<eos> That was a long time ago.<eos> It was hard to punish her, because we've all done whip-its, right?<eos> All the time.<eos> She ever tell you about the time she got out of the car in the middle of the night?
You want to know why I was so upset that night?<eos> It's because I missed my best friend's birthday party, because I spent the whole day sitting in the lobby of his office while he pitched some shady business deal.<eos> When he stopped the car, he was yelling at me, so when he told me to get out, I thought he was serious, because I was 11 years old!<eos> So I got out and then he just drove away.<eos> Oh, and he'll tell you that it was, you know, just around the block.
Hey!<eos> All right.<eos> I don't really feel like a beer, so I'm gonna go smoke.<eos> I could never figure out that kid's moods.<eos> God bless you, if you can.
Oh, my God.<eos> Fuck.<eos> So tell me about your app, Dad.<eos> Well... it's called the R Car.<eos> It's a high-end car service that comes and picks you up.
I don't know, that just seemed a little, uh... judge-y.<eos> Do you hate that I smoke? - Why?<eos> Do you want me to hate it?<eos> - Do I want you to hate it?<eos> Like, if it'd help you to quit, knowing that I hated it or something.
Okay.<eos> Call me tomorrow.<eos> Okay.<eos> And... and thanks.<eos> Probably call you tonight.
- Okay, don't say that.<eos> You say that all the time!<eos> Yeah, I can say it, but you can't.<eos> Just support me!<eos> Oh, so lie to you now?
You're, like, keeping tallies on me all the time.<eos> Like, four meetings this week, three meetings last week, and you're fucking, like, checking up on me.<eos> You know what?<eos> Why don't you go find some rich old guy, and you can be his kept woman... and he can fucking ignore you, which is what you want.<eos> You don't want anybody caring about you, you don't want anybody looking out for you.
You know what?<eos> Why don't you go find some rich old guy, and you can be his kept woman... and he can fucking ignore you, which is what you want.<eos> You don't want anybody caring about you, you don't want anybody looking out for you.<eos> You wanted to be treated like dirt and be ignored, 'cause that's what you're familiar with.<eos> And then somebody comes along and treats you kindly, and you don't know how to fucking process it!
- I don't want you to be late. - All right.<eos> Thanks for the gift.<eos> Bye-bye.<eos> Help!<eos> You think your daddy's gonna save you just 'cause you're his little girl?
People love hearing about phone sex.<eos> But here's what's actually interesting. I make him call me every night at 6:00 p.m. sharp and he has to text me back within 30 minutes.<eos> Oh, so you're a crazy person.<eos> A thousand percent, but isn't he crazy, too, for going along with it?<eos> - I don't know, maybe he loves you.
That's actually not necessarily true.<eos> When my dad died, it actually got harder as time went on.<eos> I know you're trying to help.<eos> Do you remember when he used to lie on the floor and watch us have sex?<eos> - That, uh, creeped you out, as I recall.
Um, I'm breaking up with you.<eos> - What?<eos> - Hear me out.<eos> Um, this break up, it's actually gonna give you a lot of really exciting opportunities to meet new people.<eos> It's time for you to take your wings and soar, because, um, you're ready, and I can't hold you back.
- I just need, like, five minutes.<eos> - Gus, dude...<eos> - I think I can convince him, you know?<eos> - Look, you need to move on, okay?<eos> He doesn't need you anymore.
- This is about your feelings towards me.<eos> - We're in the middle of a scene.<eos> You didn't like me from the start.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I... I didn't even know you, okay?
Do you feel better?<eos> You didn't look great last time I saw you.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I think over the last week, maybe I just... had some... life-changing breakthroughs, honestly. You know?<eos> I meant last time I saw you, you were throwing up in the toilet.
Bosch, Bosch, Bosch.<eos> Look at you.<eos> Most guys would've pulled the pin, take the pension, lean back, enjoy life.<eos> Except you got none.<eos> When the department finally puts you out to pasture, you'll eat your gun.
It's good.<eos> Salty.<eos> Slurpy.<eos> Naw, I'm not hungry, but I'm gonna grab a beer and come join you.<eos> So, Grace, what brings you by?
When Maddie finishes school.<eos> You know what?<eos> Fuck this.<eos> This is me, Grace, asking.<eos> What the fuck is eating you, Harry?
I don't have a question, more of a comment.<eos> I always thought, like most people, that if someone got arrested and went to jail then they probably did it, or did something bad.<eos> But innocent people get locked up... and I don't really think there's any justice if we just put blind faith in the system.<eos> So, thank you for opening my eyes.<eos> This is really amazing art, and you're very brave for sharing everything that's happened to you.
I guess we're gonna move into that three-bedroom in our building.<eos> Great.<eos> I have such fond memories of that master closet.<eos> Hey!<eos> Mike told me he loves you like family.
You got him to put that gun down.<eos> I just don't want to relive it at all.<eos> I hear you, baby, I hear you.<eos> I understand that, but listen to me, you know, fear sometimes is a good thing.<eos> When we can use that adrenalin to fight or take flight... you can't freeze when someone grabs you and you're certainly not going to be able to talk your way out of an attack.
You don't need to know what to do.<eos> - You're too young to be having sex.<eos> - Okay, it's true, but... we teach straight kids what to do at 14, you know, just in case... and we advise them to wait, but they have questions and we give them answers.<eos> Where do LGBT kids go for answers?<eos> Not to an app, where you could meet strangers who could hurt you.

What if he raped you, buddy?<eos> There are so many what-ifs.<eos> Each worse than the other.<eos> I know that you have better judgment than this.<eos> Honey, we want you, when you're ready, and hopefully, when you're older, to have positive sexual experiences, not ones that could scar you for life.
You're getting adopted?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> They wouldn't let her move in here while Mike was fostering you.<eos> I know that she has a felony, but she is not a bad influence.<eos> Well, now that he's adopting you, that won't be an issue.
I'm gonna make sure they get informed off campus.<eos> - I wanna adopt you.<eos> - Ana has a record, you know.<eos> They wouldn't let her move in here while Mike was fostering you.<eos> But now that he's adopting you, that won't be an issue.
- Uh, me, right here.<eos> - There you go.<eos> - Me next. - All right.<eos> - That's great.<eos> I got a bunch of meds your mom sent up for you.
- Yeah.<eos> That's the point.<eos> I read this book, My Year with Eleanor.<eos> And it's based on that thing Eleanor Roosevelt supposedly said:<eos> "You should do one thing a day that scares you."
Russell Wilson.<eos> Love them Seahawks.<eos> Yeah?<eos> He can't do a damn thing without an offensive line, though, can he? So he's not your pimp?<eos> He didn't brand you?
What are you talking about?<eos> Kim had to inform me about today's meeting.<eos> She thought it was a little odd that I wasn't CC'ed.<eos> I'm sure it was a mistake.<eos> No one purposefully left you off.
And she and her wife<eos> - adopted me and my brother.<eos> - So, Stef's a lez.<eos> That's what I thought with that hair and all.<eos> Yeah, you're really lucky that Stef got you into G.U.
I could've ended up like her or any of these girls if you hadn't rescued me and Jude.<eos> You guys were always meant to be our kids.<eos> You know?<eos> I love you.<eos> Oh, I love you too.
- Yeah, yeah, no...<eos> - Keep going, keep going.<eos> Um, I take one capsule by mouth two to three times a day!<eos> Hey!<eos> Well, there's the happiest I've seen you since the accident.
For your sake, I hope that he never finds out that you knew all along.<eos> Russell gonna be mad as hell I got busted.<eos> I can't do this anymore.<eos> If you help us build a case against your pimp, we're gonna put him behind bars.<eos> You're really lucky that Seth got you into G.U.
Didn't wanna scare you.<eos> Too late.<eos> What are you... doin' down here... alone?<eos> You know, uh...<eos> Moms say there's no way a jury's gonna convict you on circumstantial evidence.
Yeah, I mean, I... I...<eos> I went and saw someone, but... you know, they wanted to put me on pills.<eos> But, you know, they've got a lotta side effects.<eos> I think they...<eos> I think they screw you up more, so...
You callin' him your boyfriend don't sound like<eos> - you're serious about gettin' outta the life.<eos> - You don't know me.<eos> - My mom'll help you.<eos> - Like she helped you?
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot that you were a step-dad for, like, five minutes.<eos> After everything that Ana put you and Jesus through.<eos> At least she didn't get rid of us.<eos> Then why are you making Emma feel worse for something that was really hard for her to do?<eos> Because this is exactly why she didn't tell you, Mariana.
- What?<eos> No.<eos> Uh, h... he's just mad because I... didn't fill up the car when I used it last.<eos> Hey. Uh... don't say anything to anybody about what you told me earlier.<eos> - What did she tell you?
What's up?<eos> So when did you stop taking your anti-seizure meds?<eos> So your mama and I have discussed the legal strategy with your lawyers, and they think that using the DNA report and Aaron's testimony... can only strengthen your case, but only to establish your state of mind in the car, that at the time,<eos> you thought Troy had killed Martha.<eos> They still want you to say that Kyle manipulated you and that you now believe he was rightly convicted.
Emma got pregnant.<eos> - Oh? - But then, then, she... she had an abortion.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - I just... I just found out, and I thought that you guys should know.<eos> - Did Emma tell you?
"It was a garden axe.<eos> I was helping my grandmother in the garden."<eos> Which would be fine... except you gave sworn testimony that you were at work the day she was killed.<eos> Now, we have a witness who was painting your grandmother's curb that day, and can prove it.<eos> Who places you at the scene.
- You know, I'm better than I've been in a long while, thanks.<eos> That's fantastic to hear, but look, maybe we shouldn't-- not press my luck by sitting down with your new girlfriend?<eos> Well, no.<eos> Just--just wait a little bit.<eos> Let Thea come back and prep you and--
I assume preventing black market nuclear deals would be pretty high on their to-do list.<eos> John's right about Russia.<eos> Argus can't operate here without causing a diplomatic crisis.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Speaking of diplomatic crises, why did your friend punch you?
Sit.<eos> John Diggle, it's good to see you.<eos> Now you're my favorite American.<eos> Thanks.<eos> So what brings you to Russia?
Mr. Yamane's criminal enterprise is responsible for much of the designer drug trade in Starling City.<eos> I think you'll recognize his chief product.<eos> My sister was using this, so I killed her dealer, but I didn't consider the supply.<eos> I left her, I left the city vulnerable.<eos> This is why I found you, Oliver, so you can correct your mistakes.
- Oliver, we don't have time!<eos> We have to get Walker now, right now!<eos> Let me in there, and I'll give him all the persuasion he needs.<eos> He's gonna crack.<eos> If you push him too hard right now, he'll tell you whatever you want to hear to get the pain to stop!
It was...<eos> It was part of my life that I thought that I had moved past, but...here we are.<eos> Right.<eos> You know, the other guys said when you get in one of your moods I should just let you be, but, um, to be honest, brooding really kind of gets on my nerves.<eos> They told you about me?
Is--is this mood because you got pulled back into some Bratva drama?<eos> No, it...<eos> Dinah, I'm trying to move forward, but I'm back here, I'm in Russia, in the Bratva, and it just proves to me I can't seem to do that.<eos> Prometheus got in your head.<eos> What was it, some crap about infecting the people closest to you?
You affect the people in your life, Oliver.<eos> That's hardly a revelatory observation.<eos> In--in fact, I--I think it's, uh-- it's called living.<eos> Prometheus has you so fixated on what's wrong with you that you've completely stopped seeing what's right.<eos> You know, John and Felicity, they'll listen to you because you have more to offer than just this.
Your past is a part of you.<eos> There is nothing you can do about that.<eos> You can't change it.<eos> It doesn't mean it has to be your anchor.<eos> The other names in that book are waiting for you, Oliver.
They're waiting for you at home.<eos> I know.<eos> Leaving the Bratva is not going to be easy.<eos> I swore an oath of allegiance.<eos> Your father asked you to take a different vow, did he not?
You know, if visiting Star City's sister city is what it took to get you to bed, I would have bought you a ticket to Russia months ago.<eos> A friend of mine told me that my...<eos> My past doesn't have to be my anchor, and I think my past is what was... Stopping me from moving things forward with you.<eos> Looking at all this, I can understand why.<eos> What exactly happened to you on that island anyway?
Didn't you put China White in prison, like, forever ago?<eos> Yeah.<eos> A couple times.<eos> Why does she look so familiar?<eos> Maybe she arrested you once.
No. Heh.<eos> No. I'm sorry. I thought that you were doing a joking thing.<eos> I--so I did a joking thing back.<eos> Are you not?<eos> I was working on a different story, and, uh, well, some things came up that relate to you.
I am gonna stay here until we take out Gregor and we protect the Bratva.<eos> Ty skazal, "stay"?<eos> Were you going to leave?<eos> Look, Anatoly.<eos> I realized I have to get back to my life, but then I saw what Gregor did to you because of me.
On the ground!<eos> Besides, I owe this son of a bitch some payback.<eos> Freeze!<eos> Get on the floor!<eos> I listened to you once.
- And I have to wonder about the timing because...nothing like this has ever happened to me before I asked whether you were the Green Arrow.<eos> Susan... I swear to you I didn't have anything to do with this,<eos> And you're going to stand here and tell me that you're not the Green Arrow.<eos> - I already--<eos> - Because that tattoo on your chest marks you as a Bratva captain.
Thea asked me to put a few things on Susan's computer.<eos> Wait.<eos> Wait.<eos> Wait.<eos> Wait. Thea asked you? !
There's no way you're going to suffer for my sins, Oliver.<eos> That's why I'm not giving you a choice.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Hey, stranger.<eos> Haven't seen you around much today.
I would've told you that she was going to out you as the--<eos> Green Arrow.<eos> She wouldn't do that to me.<eos> And then you would say that.<eos> Look, Ollie, the only reason I didn't tell you was because I was trying to keep your hands clean.
At least if we get shot, we don't have to go far.<eos> That is really not an encouraging perspective, Rene.<eos> Hey. Uh...<eos> Just a quick note.<eos> Listen, um, now that you're a freshly minted officer of the SCPD, we can't have you going out into the field and having your new coworkers recognize you.
Did you hack Susan Williams' computer?<eos> Thea asked me to put a few things on Susan's computer.<eos> Wait.<eos> Wait, wait, wait.<eos> Thea asked you?
I still don't know how this got leaked.<eos> We know how it got leaked.<eos> It's Prometheus.<eos> He sent the ACU after me as the Green Arrow, and now he's coming after me as the mayor.<eos> Something he set you up for in the first place.
This is so completely unfair.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That seems to be going around lately.<eos> So you got Oliver's girlfriend fired?<eos> He told you?
Yeah.<eos> That seems to be going around lately.<eos> So you got Oliver's girlfriend fired?<eos> He told you?<eos> Of course he told you.
That seems to be going around lately.<eos> So you got Oliver's girlfriend fired?<eos> He told you?<eos> Of course he told you.<eos> Well, did he also tell you it was a mistake,
Who's most in our corner?<eos> Pollard, believe it or not.<eos> That's not surprising.<eos> She can't call in the marker I owe her for helping with gun reform if I'm impeached.<eos> I'll touch base with her, see if I can get her to call you to testify in your own defense, ok?
I'll put in a word with Mayor Queen.<eos> He's not impeached yet.<eos> Please tell me you didn't send it.<eos> This thing with Kullens' wife, he doesn't deserve that.<eos> Felicity told you, didn't she?
It's politics.<eos> There's about to be a vote, so it's time to play hardball.<eos> This isn't hardball.<eos> This is cruel.<eos> What would be cruel is the people of the city not having you as the mayor.
Thank you for working hard.<eos> Thank you for banding together.<eos> - Thank you for...<eos> - Sorry. I...<eos> I mean, thank you for saying thank you... Wow, man to man, that means a lot... But I'm really late to see Paul, so...
I'm sorry.<eos> Sorry.<eos> We were stopping an assassination.<eos> Can you believe I stopped an assassination?<eos> So, um, on the way over here, I rehearsed what I would say to you... Heh... how I would win you back, tell you I love you, and all I just started with was definitely not how I planned on opening.
He's holding an innocent woman hostage, and I need your help to find her.<eos> - You're insane.<eos> - Doris, please.<eos> You need to understand the truth.<eos> You have to know at some level that your husband has been keeping something from you.
Can you guys hear me in there?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Just waiting on that rescue.<eos> Good. Step back!<eos> I'm glad Talia told you.
That's great.<eos> You've also been chosen as the first woman to go to Mars.<eos> Sorry.<eos> A friend of mine is missing.<eos> The information we gave you didn't help?
I'm sorry.<eos> Oh, my g-- come on!<eos> Are we serious?<eos> Oliver, what are you trying to prove, man?<eos> Evelyn betrayed you.
Thank you.<eos> You remember first time we met on the Amazo?<eos> I was performing surgery on myself.<eos> It's kind of difficult to forget.<eos> Yeah. What was it I said to you then?
Chase had me--<eos> And he let me go.<eos> Go slow, man.<eos> It's over.<eos> Oliver, we're gonna get this son of a bitch for whatever he did to you.
That's what I'm gonna help you do, Oliver.<eos> You don't kill because you have to.<eos> I wanted to!<eos> And I liked it!<eos> We're gonna get this son of a bitch for whatever he did to you.
No place good.<eos> Well, the city council bought my story about your, spiritual retreat.<eos> And it turns out councilwoman Pollard is a big fan of all that stuff.<eos> You know, the woo-woo zen stuff.<eos> Look, I'm not asking what he did to you, all right?
I'm so sorry.<eos> This wasn't you, Oliver.<eos> It was him.<eos> Well, I... I created him.<eos> And I know that that might sound weird, but, this happened to you because of me.
This wasn't you, Oliver.<eos> It was him.<eos> Well, I... I created him.<eos> And I know that that might sound weird, but, this happened to you because of me.<eos> Don't let him do this to you.
And I know that that might sound weird, but, this happened to you because of me.<eos> Don't let him do this to you.<eos> Don't let that bastard inside your head.<eos> I gave the police a statement about him.<eos> But they didn't believe you because he probably had an ironclad alibi, right?
So you got Anatoly to kill Chase so we wouldn't have to.<eos> I created Prometheus, John.<eos> I created this whole thing.<eos> Chase's death should be on my conscience, not yours.<eos> What the hell did Chase do to you, man, to convince you to think that any of this is ok?
The Oliver I know would never let a group of dangerous criminals crawl into his city, let them steal medicine.<eos> You don't know what kind of man I am.<eos> What?<eos> !<eos> What the hell did Chase do to you, Oliver?
I guess you could say that I hacked the hackers. Whoa.<eos> What?<eos> The pixilation algorithm is encrypted.<eos> I should've known it would be encrypted, but it's encrypted.<eos> Well, how long will it take you to break the encryption?
But I'm not leaving Star City, not till I get what I came for.<eos> You know as well as I do once there is deal, it is forever.<eos> I understand how the Bratva works. I...<eos> I am asking you this as a friend.<eos> And I am telling you as friend, if you interfere with my operation, no favor exists that can repair break between you and I.
Now's not the time.<eos> You wanted to see me, Hoss?<eos> Yeah.<eos> F-first, close the door.<eos> Second, what have I told you about calling me "Hoss"?
Little bit to the right.<eos> Oh. This?<eos> What is it?<eos> Some on-the-fly coding from Mr. James.<eos> Told you he was the best there ever was.
And the world is safer for it.<eos> It could be safer...<eos> But it's not better.<eos> The woman I love could never do this.<eos> Lyla, this job has changed you.
I know that they gave you a sense of belonging that I haven't-- no.<eos> You didn't back my play.<eos> I--I was worried.<eos> You don't trust me.<eos> After all these years, all of the times that I supported you, even when I didn't agree, you couldn't do the same for me.
Don't do this.<eos> Helix is about to extract Cayden James.<eos> You're holding someone with no lawyer, no trial.<eos> The woman I love could never do this.<eos> Lyla, this job has changed you.
So you're saying even if we had a nuke down here, it wouldn't work?<eos> Seems like Cisco did such a good job of turning this place into an impenetrable fortress, he turned it into an impenetrable death trap.<eos> Chase doesn't want to kill me, remember?<eos> Yeah.<eos> He just locked you down here for the fun of it.
- Yeah.<eos> - Past tense.<eos> Yes.<eos> - Look.<eos> I know that he hurt you by not telling you about his son, but-- look.
I'm not gonna say that Oliver Queen plays great with others.<eos> - But he can still change that about himself.<eos> - Tch. - You know what he can't change?<eos> What?<eos> That way he looks at you.
That's weird.<eos> That would mean-- no, no, no!<eos> Rene, stop!<eos> I'm gonna need you to stop making that noise.<eos> I'm sorry my agonizing pain is bothering you.
That's why you disbanded the team, isn't it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oliver, you said that I don't know the kind of man that you are.<eos> I wouldn't have fallen in love with you or wanted to marry you if I didn't know exactly the kind of man that you are.<eos> Chase tortured you for a week.
Yeah.<eos> Oliver, you said that I don't know the kind of man that you are.<eos> I wouldn't have fallen in love with you or wanted to marry you if I didn't know exactly the kind of man that you are.<eos> Chase tortured you for a week.<eos> You're the toughest person I know, but anyone--anyone would have admitted to being a tap-dancing flamingo after what he put you through.
Chase tortured you for a week.<eos> You're the toughest person I know, but anyone--anyone would have admitted to being a tap-dancing flamingo after what he put you through.<eos> Adrian Chase didn't make me a killer.<eos> No. 5 years in hell did that, 5 years dealing with the city's worst did that.<eos> You have spent a decade dealing with horrors that most people don't even realize exist, and the fact that that didn't turn you into a monster proves exactly the kind of person that you are.
I just weathered a scandal.<eos> I need to get out in front of this one.<eos> Ok, well, I think you should reconsider doing this whole press conference.<eos> Why?<eos> Because this could be what Chase is manipulating you into just like he manipulated you into the impeachment by throwing Green Arrow under the bus.
Chase wanted everyone cleared out.<eos> It seems that way.<eos> It's a hell of a big building.<eos> If he's in there, we should get started.<eos> If Chase wanted you here for some reason, he could have been more specific about which floor.
Listen to me, you go into that courtroom.<eos> Sure, Zoe's got to relive some real bad times, but for the rest of-- look at me.<eos> For the rest of her life, the new memories that she's gonna have...<eos> You get to make sure they're great, all right?<eos> And you get to decide how she remembers you.
You can right my wrongs.<eos> You can be better than I was.<eos> You can save this city.<eos> Heh! No pressure or anything.<eos> Is this the video you said your father left for you?
I want to know how I missed it.<eos> Missed what?<eos> He's a murderer.<eos> I mean, he helped Merlyn start the Undertaking. I've never deluded myself into thinking that he was a Saint but to take a man's life, cover it up, it-- it's like I didn't know him at all.<eos> Has it occurred to you that this is exactly what Chase wants?
He's a murderer.<eos> I mean, he helped Merlyn start the Undertaking. I've never deluded myself into thinking that he was a Saint but to take a man's life, cover it up, it-- it's like I didn't know him at all.<eos> Has it occurred to you that this is exactly what Chase wants?<eos> Ok, the question was rhetorical.<eos> Of course it's occurred to you.
And of course this is what Chase wants.<eos> Chase wants to destroy the basis for everything that we're doing here.<eos> And that crusade began with my father.<eos> Everything that I've done-- everything-- has in some way been about honoring him.<eos> Your father inspired you to save this city.
Actually, we found Sampson and his buddies on the roof.<eos> And they've got their super toxic gas with them. Copy.<eos> Tell Wild Dog to sit tight until we get there.<eos> Why'd he say I had to sit tight?<eos> - Because he knows you. - Oh.
I never really took it seriously.<eos> Until now, right? Yeah.<eos> I have this really bad feeling.<eos> It's right in the pit of my stomach.<eos> What's it telling you?
Why did you involve William?<eos> That's my boy.<eos> He's an innocent.<eos> So was my wife, man, but you involved her.<eos> I already told you, Oliver.
Not with us.<eos> Relax.<eos> Enjoy the weather.<eos> Ms. Smoak.<eos> Anybody ever tell you how much you suck at life?
- Richie Doyle, it's me, jan Thompson, you went to school with my boys, I was a friend of your mother's.<eos> - Oh Mrs. Thompson, hi.<eos> - Hi, oh it is so good to see you.<eos> - Yeah, same to you.<eos> - What brings you back to globe?
And I thought Sarah could use a little country living again.<eos> - Oh Sarah's back too, oh that's wonderful,<eos> I have to stop in on her.<eos> Molly hanning, she's a little uhm- strange?<eos> - You said it, not me, anyway i don't wanna keep you, but it is so nice to see you again.
- I know that she's here.<eos> - Sarah- no, Richard it was Elizabeth.<eos> - Okay, let's get to bed huh?<eos> Hello?<eos> - Saw you at the bar tonight, sorry I had to leave so suddenly.
- Away with you, servant of lies, child of evil!<eos> God's word holds the power!<eos> - Does it want to see my power?<eos> - God, Sarah.<eos> - I cast you out!
- Does it want to see my power?<eos> - God, Sarah.<eos> - I cast you out!<eos> I believe in the true god, creator of heaven and earth!<eos> I cast you out!
I believe in the true god, creator of heaven and earth!<eos> I cast you out!<eos> For he is the one true god!<eos> We.<eos> I cast you out!
I cast you out!<eos> For he is the one true god!<eos> We.<eos> I cast you out!<eos> I cast you out in the name of the lord!
But that's assuming you've come in peace.<eos> Have you come in peace, Mehgan?<eos> That depends, Edric.<eos> On what?<eos> Do you remember how Father used to tell me off for playing tricks on you?
There's dragonheart in both of you.<eos> Passionate, yes, but for those who are worthy it can do wondrous things.<eos> I couldn't help your father, Edric, but if you and your sister can put aside...<eos> Maybe you should stick to raising dragons.<eos> Humans haven't quite worked out for you, have they?
Stop!<eos> You're coming with me.<eos> Back!<eos> Stand there!<eos> So, just to be clear, she just walked right up to you and took your fire?
That was easy.<eos> Get over there!<eos> I mean, do you even count as a dragon anymore?<eos> You're more like a worm. Like a leggy worm...<eos> Well, that shut you up.
We need horses. And we need more armor for the men.<eos> Move and we shoot.<eos> I'm sorry, Edric.<eos> You're strong. But arrows are faster.<eos> Are the holdings and titles I gave you worth nothing?
Nothing about the bond seems the same with twins.<eos> And I know only what your brother told me.<eos> What he doesn't know could fill the sea.<eos> Why?<eos> What did he tell you?
Excuse me, My Queen.<eos> I was just leaving.<eos> Queen Mehgan, when you were born, you inherited a gift, a dragonheart's power to bond with another.<eos> But this power comes from giving up a part of yourself.<eos> When you only take something, you build a wall between yourself and those who care about you.
- Come on.<eos> - Help him up.<eos> Don't pull him out. We'll sink!<eos> Row.<eos> Looks like Odin's favor has abandoned you.
Yes.<eos> This is all your fault.<eos> Bring the Queen to me.<eos> This is my fault?<eos> She was gonna kill you!
She was gonna kill you!<eos> - I was trying to save you!<eos> - You ruined everything!<eos> I didn't need your help!<eos> She was gonna kill you!
That was a third.<eos> My shirt!<eos> Don't lose your head, sis!<eos> What if you win, Eddy?<eos> There's no one here to applaud you.
- Nick!<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - You're alive.<eos> - How many are behind you?
I'm coming over.<eos> At this hour?<eos> I'll be outside your house in five minutes.<eos> Mommy?<eos> I'm sorry to wake you, sweetie.
- Mm-hmm.<eos> I couldn't sleep.<eos> - Why not?<eos> Because of that man who hurt your neck.<eos> He was mean, and I didn't want him to ever hurt you again, Mommy.
I have the ear of the entire community and I've heard nothing.<eos> I hired you.<eos> I gave you people a chance.<eos> And now, my son...<eos> I know one of you did it!
I am sorry for your son, Mrs. Witherspoon.<eos> You no longer work for me.<eos> There will be an investigation.<eos> I will see to it that you never find work in Shelburne again.<eos> None of you!
I did.<eos> A certain pestering woman brought me across the ocean to do the devil's work.<eos> Sierra Leone.<eos> It is a land on the west coast of Africa.<eos> It is fine and fertile with plenty of room for you.
TEAM CHRISTINA KNOCKOUT ROUND.<eos> WHOO!<eos> CHRISTINA, YOU GOT A TOUGH DECISION COMING UP.<eos> PHARRELL, WHAT DID YOU THINK?<eos> THIS WAS BREAKTHROUGH MOMENTS FOR BOTH OF YOU GUYS.
What have they done? !<eos> Rotted all our winter supply of grain!<eos> She killed goody Trask! Proof?<eos> !<eos> Have any of you any proof?
Sohone!<eos> Quick, Mune<eos> Get out of here!<eos> I can't hold it for long.<eos> I HAVE ENOUGH OF YOU.
He didn't just get lucky, Tiny Kevin.<eos> It's more like he broke the whole fucking casino.<eos> You two boys looking forward to the big day?<eos> Well, actually, I won't be there on the big day.<eos> I thought you two were coupled up?
Do not let your hearts be troubled.<eos> Do not be afraid.<eos> Remain in my love.<eos> Again I say, remain in my love;<eos> and surely, I am with you always to the very end of the age.
Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> That was a tough decision to make.<eos> Three remarkable dishes.<eos> As you all know, there's only one of you can actually win.
Are you kidding me?<eos> Sushi chefs only make sushi.<eos> It's an extremely, extremely, specific area of the culinary world.<eos> (Gordon) The good news.<eos> You guys don't have to make this dish alone.
I did keep more composure than her.<eos> And I don't want to go home.<eos> They're coming out.<eos> (Gordon) Okay.<eos> Sadly, one of you have to leave the Masterchef kitchen.
Trust me.<eos> I've had thousands.<eos> It's a shame for anyone to be judged solely on their worst moment and their worst dish.<eos> This is our search for America's best home cook, and this is America, a country built on opportunities and second chances.<eos> We've invited you all back to the Masterchef kitchen so that one of you...
We've invited you all back to the Masterchef kitchen so that one of you...<eos> Can win this.<eos> [Exclamations]<eos> A Masterchef apron.<eos> For one of you, this will be your ticket back...
Yes.<eos> Fresh pasta?<eos> Yes.<eos> Caramelized the pork chop, roasted mushrooms, and making a celery puree?<eos> I mean, I've never seen this with you.
Tali.<eos> Tanya.<eos> Anna.<eos> Scott.<eos> You four have shown that you are truly great home cooks.
Scott.<eos> You four have shown that you are truly great home cooks.<eos> Today...<eos> Great is not quite good enough.<eos> We have to say good-bye to all four of you.
"is greater than all the other wickedness of the world."<eos> One early church father reminded women,<eos> "Do you not realise that Eve is YOU?<eos> "YOU desecrated the fateful tree, YOU disobeyed the law of God,<eos> "YOU persuaded the man "against whom the Devil could not prevail by force.
It's gonna be a bloodbath.<eos> Good news. The cops are here.<eos> All right, kids, this better be good. I was in the forest wrestling with a bear claw when we got the call.<eos> I was eating a doughnut.<eos> All three of you, step to the car now.
Therefore...<eos> Free will?<eos> So... it all ends well?<eos> Thank God!<eos> "OH, POOR YOU WHO FEEL THE SAME...
Once the swelling goes down and the discoloration fades with these contact lenses, you could look like this man.<eos> Good.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Well, gentlemen, good evening.<eos> I've done work with you before.
This is a matter for internal security.<eos> I am placing you each under guard until this thing is over.<eos> Keeping us under guard will not end it.<eos> He wants to finish off the three of us.<eos> The two of you, actually.
The two of you, actually.<eos> What about you?<eos> I swapped wallets with Horst.<eos> When the afternoon paper hits the street Amar will think he killed me.<eos> This will leave you two as his next targets.
312.<eos> He checked in this morning.<eos> Call me as soon as anything happens.<eos> Make sure Maddy does nothing stupid.<eos> I cannot bear the thought of losing any more of you.
Paddock.<eos> Mrs Paddock?<eos> Mulder.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> It's been nice working with you.
[ Chattering, yelling in spanish ]<eos> Silencio, mis amigos.<eos> Silencio.<eos> You said... you said...<eos> If we bought this water from you, we would be safe.
Nothing but that thing in his hand.<eos> Don't look like no weapon.<eos> Okay, let him come.<eos> You the law?<eos> Damn it, are you the cop or not?
The shit that's going on, we're worried about you, sis.<eos> I got this.<eos> Yeah, we knew you were gonna say that.<eos> You always just wanna handle it on your own.<eos> But this isn't just about you.
Some would argue that's worse.<eos> All right, you need to leave.<eos> No, I'm close to something.<eos> I can feel it.<eos> This is not about you!
You know, when I went to the Pentagon with the evidence of the Sun Gun, I...<eos> I recommended your team for the project.<eos> I did.<eos> I...<eos> I read all about you.
All our guinea pigs are escaping, and with them, your chances for a cure.<eos> Did you ever care about me?<eos> Do you hear yourself?<eos> Do you hear yourself?<eos> Making this moment about you!
That's expensive!<eos> Not the helmet!<eos> That's my favorite. Stop it!<eos> Stop resisting.<eos> This isn't about you.
I'm not.<eos> What the hell are you talking about?<eos> Only thing I told you tonight that's true is that you shouldn't trust people in here.<eos> But you did.<eos> Now I know all about you.
I've been dreaming about getting him back ever since.<eos> Then I read about you in the paper, and I realized I could get back at him without ever leaving these walls.<eos> - You son of a bitch.<eos> - Take it easy, Mike.<eos> You remember, I know about you.
Miss Kringle? No.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> My name's Isabella.<eos> Um, I'm sorry to bother you; I don't usually talk to people.<eos> There's just, um, something about you. No, no, please.
No, I don't.<eos> But I'm nothing like you.<eos> Hey there.<eos> You're up early.<eos> I had a dream about you.
Dugan, we're in the boiler room. We need an exit.<eos> Gentlemen, if you know the way out of this facility, now's the time to share it.<eos> Yeah, use your big brain and get us --<eos> - Li!<eos> - Above you!
Not with what's coming.<eos> - What is coming to old town?<eos> (grunts and groans)<eos> - So you're khlyen's pet. - How do you know khlyen?<eos> - We've all heard about you.
They don't trust you because they saw us together.<eos> Because I'm supposed to be dead.<eos> Marcellus seems to be accepting my reasons.<eos> That I'm playing you, you're a source of valuable information.<eos> I used the same line with Carlos about you.
I'm not the "let's get real" type, anyway.<eos> Ask DeVore in Vice. She'd tell you.<eos> "Idealizing a past partner." You are so textbook.<eos> Seriously, you can stop talking right now.<eos> I know everything there is to know about you.
I'll get the one by the truck.<eos> Don't move.<eos> I said don't move.<eos> You're from Defiance.<eos> They wrote that book about you.
- He has a kid, right?<eos> - Yeah, that's why I'm help...<eos> Bup, bup, bup, bup, bup.<eos> I don't know what you're up to, but this is about a family.<eos> This isn't about you.
It would take him two hours, at least, just to get familiar with this interface.<eos> You need to re-engage that power source now.<eos> It is the only thing that can save Sylvester from plummeting to his death.<eos> Walter, I have been giving you the benefit of the doubt all day but I have to stop listening to you.<eos> We received an e-mail about you.
I don't know if you've read the news, but, uh,<eos> - I'm working on real cases now.<eos> - Um...<eos> You must be the brother.<eos> Heard a lot about you.
Hawkeye:<eos> Okay, maybe you don't remember me,<eos> But I bet you remember this.<eos> Call it my "anti-iron man" arrow.<eos> Built specifically by you, to take out your armor.
Mr. Deane, the clerk will give you your new trial date.<eos> Your honor, this is completely unreasonable.<eos> Approach the bench.<eos> Judge Stipple, I don't think we've had the pleasure.<eos> My husband warned me about you.
Swap sides?<eos> My right side is... it's infinitely more camera-friendly.<eos> Maybe, but the terraformed rock over your shoulder, it creates a sense of groundedness, and people like their leaders down to Earth.<eos> Do you know, Captain?<eos> New York is whispering about you.
A guy screws up, arrangements are made.<eos> A cash settlement.<eos> If that's not enough, break a leg or an arm.<eos> No calls.<eos> Not about you.
My bull bar is broken.<eos> The mirror.<eos> What, you just reverse and hope?<eos> Where did you think I was?<eos> ! All day, I have been behind you.
Emma told me she was a patient.<eos> Who were you looking for today at Shadow Pond?<eos> I was looking for my father.<eos> Well, who is your father?<eos> I've heard many different things about you.
Here.<eos> How did you guess?<eos> I think we're meeting for the first time?<eos> Do you need to meet someone to know them?<eos> And anyway, I don't know much about you.
- You're fucking her life up.<eos> - Whatever.<eos> Whatever.<eos> Don't scream.<eos> They'll gonna make that song about you.
What's going on?<eos> Hank, this is Emma.<eos> Hi.<eos> The famous/notorious Emma.<eos> I've heard many different things about you.
You know I had to do things in legend, hmm?<eos> Violence.<eos> You were sanctioned, Martin.<eos> It's not the FBI sanction I'm worried about.<eos> You worry you're gonna have to answer for what you did undercover.
[Cell phone vibrates]<eos> You need to kick it up a notch.<eos> There was a homicide.<eos> I'm sorry. I've got to go.<eos> This is not just about you.
Um...<eos> I should have called you.<eos> It's just been a whirlwind.<eos> How are you?<eos> I'm wondering about you.
You need to stay away from him.<eos> He's not what he seems.<eos> He always has an angle,<eos> And if he thinks that you can lead him to me --<eos> This isn't about you.
I took a little pit stop in Margot's bathroom, and I happened upon her birth control pills.<eos> Which either makes you a medical miracle, or according to the birth date on your Xanax pills, it makes you 43.<eos> You might want to pop one of those.<eos> She has been giving false hope to women like me, and like you.<eos> Mostly you.
I got her a ticket and everything.<eos> Oboe.<eos> Thank you, Pavel.<eos> Maestro, I don't know if I can do this.<eos> This is not about you.
Right buddy?<eos> We haven't actually met but, um, heard lot about you.<eos> Yeah, I bet you have.<eos> Well, you know what?<eos> I've read a lot about you.
Hell yeah, black always got to go first.<eos> Amen.<eos> T, you could be one hell of a player.<eos> But your problem and everyone else in this room's problem is you don't give a damn about rules.<eos> Especially you.
That's too bad.<eos> Thank you for your time.<eos> Uhh it was a pleasure.<eos> Has anyone ever told you that you are absolutely breathtaking!<eos> Everything about you.
No.<eos> I wanted to sponsor a cash for guns event.<eos> I give you the money and you get your constituents to lay down their arms.<eos> Everybody wins.<eos> Especially you.
I don't know where you are, mate, but you're going to have to get in touch with us.<eos> FELICITY: I know all about you! And your brother!<eos> Piss off!<eos> I'm sorry I suspected you.<eos> Especially you.
167 Cedar Street.<eos> Now we need to make our way to the fourth floor.<eos> Apartment 413.<eos> Hopefully without running into this tyrannical--<eos> You again.
But not to me, and I asked for both of you to come here today.<eos> Mr. Balagan, you ever wonder why Jake didn't hire a real private eye?<eos> Someone who could actually leave the hotel?<eos> Save on travel expenses?<eos> I read about you.
Hey, remember Winston?<eos> Winston, it's my ma.<eos> Talk to her.<eos> Hey, what up, Mrs. Miller?<eos> You know, I wrote a poem about you.
Molly...<eos> Come on, do something.<eos> You're embarrassing me in front of all my guy friends.<eos> (BUZZlNG)<eos> Oh, maybe they were right about you.
So, what's your name?<eos> Yoshiyama Akari.<eos> Where do you live?<eos> After you eat that, you should go home, 'kay?<eos> Your parents at home might be worried about you.
The nurse said I might only have a day or two left.<eos> She was being kind.<eos> You're Dr. House, aren't you?<eos> Oh, God, don't tell me we used to date.<eos> The limp, yeah, I read about you.
'I want to steal your girlfriend, I think I love your girlfriend.' Sleepy Ben.<eos> That's nice.<eos> 'I definitely don't hope he dies, definitely not.<eos> 'That would be horrible, 'but he does look like he could do with a nice long relaxing coma.'<eos> Oh, it's you again.
What's your name?<eos> Lady Ursula Misseldon.<eos> You know who I am?<eos> You're Sir Francis Bryan.<eos> I've heard about you.
I'm surprised he didn't know that.<eos> Maybe that's why it didn't work.<eos> We haven't met.<eos> I'm Adrian Monk.<eos> I've heard of you.
Airport shuttle's in 15 minutes.<eos> I'm sorry. Mr. Ford, sorry.<eos> I know who you are.<eos> I've... Excuse me.<eos> I've read all about you.
I found these gloves on the table in the kitchen.<eos> They are ladies gloves, and new.<eos> They are still wrapped in the tissue.<eos> They are a gift, Mrs Rose.<eos> For you. Oh!
Tallis is perfected electronically, he is not a cyborg.<eos> He has a nano-transmitter in their eye, in the rest, he is as human as you.<eos> The buzzings are replicas biomec√¢nicas.<eos> If one day you see one without the he/she chewed, you will understand.<eos> I read on you.
- No.<eos> Oh, hey, buddy.<eos> How'd it go?<eos> I think it went pretty well.<eos> I told him all about you.
Yeah, you know, Adrian, I'm so glad you're here because, uh, my mother's coming over in a little while.<eos> Would you like to meet her?<eos> Your--Your mother?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I told her all about you.
Don't know.<eos> You?<eos> Come on, we're in a hurry.<eos> If you do exactly as I say, you'll be fine.<eos> I have a thick folder about you.
Lieutenant, welcome.<eos> Aren't you Neil Cahill?<eos> My son.<eos> Lt. Columbo.<eos> I read about you in the newspapers.
It's nothing to be ashamed of, Mr. Monk.<eos> Some people just can't handle the pressure.<eos> I didn't quit.<eos> Mr. Wagner, I'm sorry.<eos> My daughter just wrote a school paper about you.
That's why you called me?<eos> After 39 years.<eos> To fix a parking ticket?<eos> I know you can do it.<eos> I've been reading all about you.
why do feel the need to do that?<eos> Let's just stick with the professional version. Grrrr!<eos> Come on, let's get busy!<eos> So you're the genius behind this incredible brew.<eos> The whole city is buzzing about you.
This is a home run, Alex.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Well John suggested some things that just broke the all thing wide open.<eos> Judith Peck, this is Johnny Smith.<eos> I've heard about you.
Last week at the blacksmith's.<eos> I don't expect you to remember me.<eos> Oh, I do, though.<eos> How is Joseph?<eos> He was just speaking of you the other day.
-Dr. Milkman.<eos> -Yes.<eos> -The man from DARPA.<eos> -Yes.<eos> I've been reading about you.
Brigadier Harcourt's compliments. He's sent you a driver.<eos> Where's Sam?<eos> She's gone off with the youngsters.<eos> Devlin, this is Milner. Milner, Captain Devlin.<eos> I've heard a lot about you.
Really.<eos> God, I was so sure you'd be a senator.<eos> Eric, love is hard to find.<eos> And I've realized I've been taking the people who love me for granted.<eos> Especially you.
I was, first of all, wondering if, um, you'd seen her this morning?<eos> No. No. I've been working here all day.<eos> I'm sorry. I can't help you.<eos> And, uh, also, there was something you said in the pub the other day to the landlord.<eos> Um, "I know all about you.
"Tea, coffee?"<eos> "No, that won't be required at this stage"<eos> Too much papetwork might not be good<eos> well all right<eos> I have heard much about you
Lenny!<eos> Lenny.<eos> Only 's a warning?<eos> - Yes.<eos> You have me constantly questioned about you. - Yes?
She works in Whitehall.<eos> All very hush-hush, but I'm sure you'll be able to wheedle a few secrets out of her.<eos> How do you do?<eos> It's very nice to meet you, sir Ernest.<eos> I've heard a lot about you.
Ten days.<eos> I've been filling out your annual crew evaluation.<eos> - Just a formality.<eos> - I understand.<eos> The High Command has requested my evaluation of you.
Some kids grew up watching "Star Wars."<eos> I grew up watching "Wall Street."<eos> "Greed is good." Remember?<eos> Yes. I remember.<eos> In my research... I found a little story about you.
Is there anything you don't do?<eos> Fly.<eos> Now turn around so I can climb back down.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> It's you again.
Well, we did, till the handles came off those detergent boxes.<eos> Howdy.<eos> Welcome to the Deliverance Inn.<eos> You'll squeal like a pig at our hospitality.<eos> Especially you.
YOU DID IT, DIDN'T YOU?<eos> SORRY, WHAT?<eos> THE TIME MACHINE.<eos> I'M SORRY, I CAN'T-- I'M NOT READY TO TALK ABOUT THAT.<eos> I DON'T CARE WHY YOU DID IT. FOR YOURSELF, FOR THE GOVERNMENT, I JUST-- I NEED TO KNOW...
A worthy adversary.<eos> It's obviously not that fat lump lying'at your feet.<eos> Now I'm hopin'it's you.<eos> Why me?<eos> I've read all about you.
Our problems are no more than mucky,<eos> Theres always other people Who are even less lucky.<eos> Life traps them like residue -<eos> And theyre worse off than we are,<eos> For example you!
Severely? No!<eos> I deal with them lethally.<eos> Now, don't fail me again.<eos> Mr. Rochambeau.<eos> You are negaal? I am.
Finished ?<eos> Or is there more ?<eos> Whatever you said that day was a rotten lie !<eos> About Anna, about Rahul ...<eos> Even about you
We're going to need all the luck we can get From here on in.<eos> And to you...<eos> For being unpredictable.<eos> You know something funny?<eos> When you were first going to take the case, I went and read up on you.
Also publish freguently on magazine<eos> However, I have liked your this country<eos> Just leave, especially my old old woman, so<eos> Spain very with other difference<eos> The preface in your book You want to remind view the person who has deviation
The train came in through the archway, and the officer in charge of the selection went immediately to work... and sent 2,000 of them... straightaway to Special Treatment.<eos> It is not my task to interfere with the processes that take place down here.<eos> Why do you think I can help you if I can't help I.G. Farben?<eos> Allow me to express the reason.<eos> I'm not making any judgment about you.
What's he doing here?<eos> Keep him talking, I'll be in the back.<eos> Chief Inspector Tung?<eos> Chief Inspector Tung<eos> For you
Disguised as an electrical cabinet, 2 feet across, 3 feet in height, below the water line.<eos> Threat assessment verified, eh?<eos> You're the guys that get to find out how it ticks?<eos> MacGyver, Robinson. Mike Donahue.<eos> Heard a lot about you.
Norm Peterson here.<eos> I know.<eos> It's really terrible what you have to do to me, isn't it?<eos> - You know why you're here?<eos> - Everybody knows about you.
- You did.<eos> I was just playing a role.<eos> - Tonight I'm me, a tongue-tied yutz.<eos> - l want you to listen to me for a minute.<eos> There's been a lot of talk about you.
What is this?<eos> Am I being taken prisoner?<eos> The major wants some more information on you.<eos> What do you got, my file?<eos> Everything about you.
I apologise.<eos> I was kind of upset.<eos> OK, I'm sorry, too.<eos> We both got a little carried away.<eos> Especially you.
Lieutenant, welcome.<eos> Aren't you Neil Cahill?<eos> My son.<eos> Lt. Columbo.<eos> I read about you in the newspapers.
- Disappear...<eos> - # Of all you survey # - llama.<eos> # You're a gay Santa Claus #<eos> # There's a brave, new star-spangled sky #<eos> # Above you #
She said she was a seductress, third class. I was struck by the sadness and durability of her face.<eos> Something's not in orbit in the capital of this Galaxy.<eos> Hold this up.<eos> Not bad for a veteran of Guadalcanal.<eos> Just what I was thinking about you.
But I'm willing to learn<eos> Angel<eos> Make my wish come true<eos> Let me be in heaven<eos> Here on earth with you
But I'm willing to learn<eos> Angel<eos> Make my wish come true<eos> Let me be in heaven<eos> Here on earth with you
Left.!<eos> Left.!<eos> Left, right, left.!<eos> That's where we go... down!<eos> - Oh, it's you again.
I'm frightened for him, madam.<eos> I don't know what's with him but I've never seen him like that.<eos> And last night, he...<eos> He was very unhappy.<eos> So I thought that it might be because of you.
Well, that's not an insult to me because it means I look like I got railed by a football star.<eos> Wasn't intended to be a compliment.<eos> With the help of Byron, who has completed all 12 steps of Al-Anon, I have come to realize how exhausting and narcissistic and ultimately boring this whole dynamic is.<eos> And I finally feel brave enough to create some distance for myself.<eos> If you guys happen to know all of those really pretty girls out there who have, like, jobs and purses and nice personalities, those are now my friends, not you guys.
- What?<eos> Where are the rules for this stupid game anyways?<eos> Every time we fail a turn, the cops get of a piece of Archer?<eos> What's next, his knee caps or his ear lobes?<eos> Or the video of you two digging up the grave.
Nothing.<eos> Well, what did you expect to find?<eos> Something, a note, a clue, a pipe bomb.<eos> How's it going on your end?<eos> So you guys never used an on or off switch?
'Cause she doesn't have one of these.<eos> Okay, guys, I know we all woke up early and we're cranky, but let's stay focused.<eos> I'm as freaked out as the rest of you.<eos> Maybe even more, considering it looks like. A.D. was watching Ali and me sleep last night.<eos> Wait, so are you two...
Yours and Alison's.<eos> But why?<eos> I know what's happening.<eos> With the police.<eos> You'll need money for lawyers, all of you.
- You're the one who did this to him.<eos> So un-impossible it.<eos> - Fast.<eos> - Believe me,<eos> I'm trying. But if you guys can't find Damon, then there is nothing I can do.
There's a seat here.<eos> Right there.<eos> They were dirty women.<eos> They were sluts.<eos> But you are special girls.
What are you doing here?<eos> You left it pretty clear how you felt about us this morning.<eos> Carlota, she apologized.<eos> Yes...<eos> I took it out on you when it wasn't your fault, so I'm sorry.
Her foot's trapped!<eos> Weller, he's getting away.<eos> No, he's not.<eos> I'll get him.<eos> You two get Patterson!
It sounds boring, but it's actually fascinating.<eos> - Oh, fun.<eos> - What is happening?<eos> Weekend of the 25th, I'll be out of town, so you'll have Harriet.<eos> Ah. You two taking a vacation?
Okay, you know what?<eos> To be clear, that particular decision was made by Bailey.<eos> - Isn't that right, Warren?<eos> - Let's just leave me out of this.<eos> Even if Minnick's program was good, the way you two went about implementing the entire thing had zero respect for the history of this institution, certainly no respect for Dr. Webber.
If it fails, you die.<eos> We have the chemicals in another room.<eos> It's a two-woman job.<eos> If that press isn't running within an hour, I'll send someone to encourage you to work faster.<eos> You two, come.
Ooh, suppose we make the pirates an offer, sic them on the competition, and then split the take?<eos> Actually, that's not a bad idea.<eos> That's enough!<eos> This is not a democracy.<eos> You two, get out.
Mondays.<eos> Be very quiet.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Tandy.<eos> You guys wait in here, okay?
I am not going there, it just makes me think of Kasper.<eos> ARE YOU HOME?<eos> I HAVE FORGOTTEN MY KEY<eos> It was amazing when Kasper was in the window.<eos> - You both got so scared! - I thought somebody died!
- Of course.<eos> I'm gonna help reshape the agency.<eos> And get your hands dirty.<eos> Well, hopefully not just my hands.<eos> You two have sacrificed a lot for our country.
- That.<eos> - No deal!<eos> Hands off that trophy, witch!<eos> No!<eos> - You two Earp girls...
I love this song!<eos> Let's dance!<eos> Come on!<eos> Come on, guys!<eos> You two go.
And they want to hear from people who were involved.<eos> - Victim statements.<eos> - Statements of support.<eos> Statements that she isn't a threat to anybody.<eos> That you guys are not afraid of her anymore.
We'll do our Dirty Dancing routine from the fourth-grade talent show!<eos> But we lost.<eos> Well, that's only because I dropped you and you broke your arm.<eos> You guys, I'll get Macy to sing "Time Of My Life"<eos> and you two dance like it's 1987.
I'm exhausted. I'm hungry.<eos> I haven't eaten in two days.<eos> What I should do is, I should probably go upstairs, and I should probably change the batteries in my hearing aid.<eos> That way, I'll hear better, but in the meantime, you know, give her the emerald pin, because then she'll go.<eos> Um, I'll be right back, and you two can chat.
- Pick a topic.<eos> About Charlotte not meeting her that night.<eos> That's probably true.<eos> It's too easy to check.<eos> While you two are discussing this, let's remember that I was the one that was in a line-up.
Luke and i are here because we each want your votes.<eos> However, certain people want to change us Into being something each of us is not.<eos> They're publicly shaming us.<eos> We deserve it.<eos> The important thing is you two leaned something.
I mean, don't get me wrong, I ate the cheese.<eos> - Well, you can't pass up the cheese.<eos> - Well, you have to.<eos> You can't pass up the...<eos> You guys get it.
_<eos> _ _<eos> It is true.<eos> And he's leaving my mother.<eos> And why did she tell you all, and not me?
Thank you all for coming out today.<eos> There are some lessons to be learnt.<eos> First, you boys need to watch the roughhousing.<eos> 'Cause this is what can happen.<eos> And, uh, you ladies, if you're gonna be out here in the middle of the night, you need to watch where you're walking.
We weren't trying to hurt anyone.<eos> Not talking to you, Vern.<eos> Shut up.<eos> Comes to men and their deviancies, I threw my hands up long ago.<eos> But, you ladies, you should know better.
Hmm, that's a toughie.<eos> Is there an A.A. meeting in Northern California where you haven't slept with someone?<eos> What are you insinuating?<eos> I think it's pretty clear.<eos> You guys all get it, right?
I'm gonna have to take my pants off.<eos> Now you see how it happens.<eos> If you don't mind, I think I'm gonna have my dessert later.<eos> You sure?<eos> Yeah, I've got to finish my homework, and I bet you two want some alone time.
Right here.<eos> Let's do it.<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> We got this.<eos> You guys stay here.
I never said it was a good idea to let people know the apocalypse is coming.<eos> Don't worry, Cole.<eos> Be happy.<eos> What is wrong with you?<eos> All of you?
-Wafflehousebutterbob.<eos> -Cute.<eos> -Isn't it, though?<eos> Okay, I'm here now.<eos> Uh-huh. You two, park it over there.
I just got you guys back in the same house.<eos> I've never had sisters.<eos> It's nice.<eos> But it's going to implode.<eos> You know it, and I know it.
But it's going to implode.<eos> You know it, and I know it.<eos> So have at it.<eos> Go to town over the cabinets.<eos> If you're gonna kill each other, just do it already.
Raise your hand.<eos> Before we begin though, I'd like Dana McKinnie,<eos> Julie Jackson,<eos> Riley Ford and Lucy Armstrong to gather their things, and follow me into the hallway.<eos> Now, if you four girls will go down to the library, Mrs. Randolph has some special reading materials for you.
Riley Ford and Lucy Armstrong to gather their things, and follow me into the hallway.<eos> Now, if you four girls will go down to the library, Mrs. Randolph has some special reading materials for you.<eos> Are we in trouble or something?<eos> Oh, no, honey.<eos> You girls just haven't experienced your blooming yet.
'We are all Japanese.' Didn't he?<eos> It's no fun playing like this.<eos> Do you want to make a bet on the game?<eos> What will you wager?<eos> If you guys win
What is happening?<eos> What is the meaning of this?<eos> This bitch was caught escaping and I know there is an accomplice in here.<eos> Right?<eos> So tonight. Until I find the accomplice. I'm gonna have some fun with all of you.
Hurry up and take it off<eos> You take it off too!<eos> You too!<eos> Filthy bitch!<eos> You guys are not even human beings.
No, I chose not to.<eos> Where's the wine?<eos> Wait, Jackie invited you?<eos> Why?<eos> You guys hate each other.
To Aria.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> - And I better be a bridesmaid.<eos> - You kidding me?<eos> You're all gonna be up there with me.
Is there any way that we can get in touch with your father?<eos> We-we just need to ask him a couple of questions.<eos> Look, I don't know where my father is.<eos> I haven't spoken to him in years.<eos> You two seem nice enough.
It's better than yesterday.<eos> Daddy, when can we come to work and see your toys?<eos> You can come see the toys when you turn 18.<eos> Will you put Seline on, please?<eos> Okay, you two, go get your swimsuits.
This is Williamsburg; you can't spit without hitting a bartender.<eos> Or an artisanal pickle maker.<eos> Why do we live here?<eos> I'm here for the bartender interview.<eos> Oh, no, you two.
Oh, come on, Wendy.<eos> Hospital rules.<eos> Only two visitors at a time.<eos> Somebody's got to go.<eos> You two grab a snack.
Fiona only cares about herself anymore.<eos> Would you please? Fiona's your best friend.<eos> We have the key to her house, And I'm pretty sure that half our clothes in our closet are hers.<eos> - Then I'll take 'em back.<eos> - Is this a permanent thing between you two, or is it until one of you caves
Calm down.<eos> I'm gonna talk to some witnesses, and pull yourself together.<eos> You look like a homeless magician.<eos> Well... hello, bridesmaids.<eos> So, which one of you horrifying zombettes wanted the bride dead then, hey?
Will you please stop reorganizing?<eos> I need to keep busy when I'm nervous.<eos> We can't call INS because they will find out we're not really married.<eos> - Right.<eos> - You are married.
She's stronger than I am.<eos> She could defeat me.<eos> There's two of us.<eos> We got her outnumbered.<eos> You two are staying.
Great to see you.<eos> You remember Naomi?<eos> We're expecting maximum attendance around 8:00 p.m.<eos> Madeline will introduce Alison, who will say a few words, and hand over the floor to you.<eos> You draw up the play and I'll run it.
You should get back out front.<eos> My wife has big news.<eos> See?<eos> The bear didn't sink through the pool cover.<eos> You won't, either.
W√®i, everybody.<eos> I bring Boba, or bubble tea.<eos> - I'll just have a sip of yours.<eos> - No, you won't.<eos> You girls and your antics.
Okay, thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I couldn't save them.<eos> They weren't strong enough.<eos> They died so that you could live.
Here's one...<eos> Two girls walk into a dessert bar and they never leave.<eos> Ah, see?<eos> Nothing.<eos> You girls think I'm funny. Right?
You're only allowed one speaker, and I'm already signed up.<eos> I pick Grandpa.<eos> He had a cool job.<eos> What are you saying, that Daddy doesn't have a cool job?<eos> But you guys love visiting me at the office, right?
Thank you.<eos> See?<eos> You should not be ordering her around like that.<eos> I should be ordering her around like that.<eos> You two need to learn to share.
The kids are down.<eos> Enough business.<eos> Cheers, mate.<eos> On your left.<eos> I knew you and Ryan were keeping something from me.
Except for Gene Rayburn, who is, in fact, dead.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> I can't catch a break.<eos> That's fine, 'cause we actually have an idea that we are very excited about.<eos> Well, if you're excited, I'm excited.
It's a supplement, all right? !<eos> And all her girlfriends are doing it, so...<eos> Hey, you ready? Eh?<eos> Ladies, you look fantastic.<eos> Because of what you girls did!
he's looking for news all the time.<eos> What you mean?<eos> What's he after?<eos> Anything... news about Shelley or why Segunda is named like that although she's the third one...<eos> You know it then!
I don't want to die down here.<eos> What's that?<eos> Guess I clipped a wire. Sh...<eos> Oh, god...<eos> You witches with your talk of communing with nature, you don't know enough not to wear heels in the forest.
Who's desperate now?<eos> You saw what they did to him.<eos> But where will I go?<eos> Anywhere but here.<eos> You would save me.
How did A get all this stuff?<eos> You're seriously still asking how?<eos> Yeah, Aria's right.<eos> Question down here is why.<eos> Did A force you guys to sign the welcome card for Ali?
So, no more pounding and no more yelling.<eos> I'll send everybody home.<eos> No, you won't.<eos> Yes, I will, Afghanistan.<eos> This is my house, and you guys are earning this sleepover every second that you're here, okay?
Hello, neighbor.<eos> We're the welcome wagon.<eos> We heard you had a window.<eos> Aren't you sweet to come by?<eos> This is Beverly. And who are you?
You ruined her life.<eos> You ruined all of our lives.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> They did.<eos> When you two were babies, I tried to contact them anonymously to let them know that I was the donor.
D-man?<eos> L-bomb?<eos> You look good.<eos> Umm, did something?<eos> Did you two?
But part of the responsibility that goes along with being a star is learning to share the spotlight.<eos> Maybe she's gonna get the solos because she needs it more than you do right now.<eos> Truth is, Mercedes, Rachel will make you better.<eos> Her drive and ambition will help you raise your expectations of yourself, and you can use that to become great.<eos> And I have a feeling you two are gonna become great friends. (scoffs) (sniffles)
Well, gay marriage is illegal in Ohio, but legal in Indiana.<eos> - Makes absolutely no sense.<eos> - No, no.<eos> I mean, what are we doing in a barn in rural northeast Indiana?<eos> I thought it would be fun for you two to get married in the barn that Brittany was born in.
Oh, i should let you all talk.<eos> No.<eos> Shelby, what do you think? Um, (chuckles) All i know is that family is a blessing,<eos> Daddy?<eos> Well, If you girls want to get to know scarlett, I'll do everything i can to support that.
And then we're all gonna die!<eos> - That doesn't even make any sense.<eos> - None of that could possibly happen.<eos> Other people's dreams are so boring.<eos> Haven't you two got any common sense? Mm-hmm. Well, the Truitt brothers believe it.
- Dave's.<eos> - What?<eos> Yeah, they'll search the house and find any other cameras or anything this guy's using to stalk me.<eos> So, why can't you stay?<eos> You guys will have the detail.
She's making a move.<eos> Oh, my God. What do I tell her?<eos> Tell her you're in.<eos> What?<eos> You two have some drinks.
'Now the last days of my family drew near.<eos> 'The girls were grown and they wished to be gone.'<eos> You're not leaving!<eos> Doth, Phyll, she's not leaving.<eos> Stay out of this, you two.
I need Miller.<eos> ~ Yeah.<eos> Course you do.<eos> Claire just handed me this pendant.<eos> You two should have plenty to talk about.
Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> Tia and I decided that it's best to get a fresh start.<eos> We don't want anyone from the old team.<eos> You know, conflict of interest and all that.<eos> Um, you guys are from the old team.
Why do you think I've been winking at you all night?<eos> I thought it was 'cause you like me. Hey, I'm telling ya, I've been here since 2:00 A.M.<eos> I don't have no idea why your sister thinks<eos> I was in great neck having Asian with Decavellichi.<eos> 'Cause she's out of her mind like the rest of you.
- What the fuck?<eos> !<eos> - Enough!<eos> Enough!<eos> You two are the people I love most in the world.
- Yeah, it got cancelled.<eos> I mean, not that I didn't want to see you, but I was not planning.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> What are you doing? Amber and I are putting together her crib, and we don't have a hammer.<eos> Both of you guys are gonna put a crib together that a live baby goes in?
Okey-doke. You there!<eos> Stay.<eos> Vanessa.<eos> She's called Zara, good little worker.<eos> Rest of you, back on board!
An explanation something.<eos> Someone puts her whole family in danger, you want to find out there was a good reason.<eos> You want to believe she didn't have any choice.<eos> Have you talked to Cristina?<eos> I presume you guys talk all the time, especially now.
[Woman coughs] Oh, come on. [Coughs]<eos> Let's not name the next one.<eos> Hurts too bad when you fail.<eos> If Jane asks, you rowed.<eos> You two have a unique relationship, don't you?
Don't.<eos> - Come on.<eos> Give me your jacket.<eos> - Stop it.<eos> Hey, you two, knock it off.
Parsons is in dire need of a fresh start, so Shaw kills Walsh, sells his I.D. to Parsons, and then everything's back to business as usual.<eos> - Until they found Walsh's body.<eos> - Right.<eos> And Shaw knew that the body would lead to Parsons, so he flew to Boston and took him out.<eos> You two are like a regular Cagney and Lacey.
It won't.<eos> If it does...<eos> There's a lesson in that, too.<eos> So, she just spitballs this stuff with you?<eos> It's just the two of you hanging out, talking tumor?
Oh, that was indiscreet.<eos> The point I was trying to make is this...<eos> A friend is like a business.<eos> Investing in the wrong one always proves costly.<eos> And like Heather, I'm sure that you would all want me to keep your secrets secret.
I thought Sergio was on the food truck.<eos> He better not have left his wiener apron in my car again.<eos> [laughs] Sergio no est√° aqu√≠.<eos> Dumb bitch falls for it every time.<eos> You two seem to have developed quite the playful dynamic.
Uh, we're gonna head back to the hospital.<eos> FYI, we're still working the Thomas case.<eos> Didn't someone tell you?<eos> Tell us what? Homeland Security's taking over.<eos> You two are off the case.
- My magnificent beauties.<eos> I must admit, my son has wonderful taste in women.<eos> But the night is young.<eos> There's so much more life to take.<eos> The time has almost come for you both to be reborn, to shed your old lives forever.
It doesn't really make any sense, we can just do away with it, but sexism isn't going anywhere, 'cause sexism is way deep the fuck down inside, so it's just the way we feel about each other.<eos> It's, "Ahh, women!<eos> "Women!<eos> Women! "Women!<eos> And you're like, "Men!
My sweet, sweet, sweet dirt.<eos> Hello, trowel.<eos> You're gonna be digging.<eos> Hello, shears.<eos> You're gonna be trimming.
Oleg was wrong.<eos> And those nipples were way too big.<eos> This is awkward.<eos> You're in the truck?<eos> No, you're in my apartment.
I'm very happy to welcome you to Hell Week here at Kappa House.<eos> Could you speak up, please?<eos> I'm having trouble hearing you.<eos> I said, "Welcome to Hell Week!"<eos> When you stupid dugongs first waltzed through that door, I could tell you thought you were gonna have it easy.
Girls, this is Detective Chisolm.<eos> He's here investigating the beheading that happened in your garden last night.<eos> Where is Ms. Bean and Chanel #2?<eos> It is pretty suspicious they're not here.<eos> Well, as far as I'm concerned, all of you are suspects.
So, an ideal family.<eos> So Zayday is running for president.<eos> And she's going to lose.<eos> There are only eight girls in this house.<eos> You guys, Chanel and Chanel #3 will all vote for Chanel, which means Zayday would need Sam and me and Grace to all vote for her, and then it'd be a tie and Chanel remains president.
You never, ever want to be the boss in a time of extreme crisis.<eos> As soon as you become the boss, you get a target on your back, from the Feds, the other families, ambitious underlings.<eos> Sure, seems like you have all the power, but you also take on the most risk.<eos> Being president of Kappa House when there is a killer hunting down sisters of Kappa House means you're the top target.<eos> I was actually hoping one of you bitches would betray me and vote for her so she could win the whole thing, but... this works out even better.
Chanel #6 or Zayday Williams?"<eos> "Because if the answer to that is yes, then felicitations, this missive is for you."<eos> So, do you all remember when we agreed to meet at the campus pool and kill the dean, and I got you all awesome new phones, so that when it came time to meet, the phone would light up a certain color, and when it did,<eos> you didn't even have to answer it, you just had to come meet at the aforementioned pool?<eos> And then do you remember not coming to the pool, despite me making it super easy for you by concocting a plan so simple that an orangutan could have figured it out?
I don't entirely know what you whores could have been doing that was more important than helping your chapter president drown a serial killer, but unless that thing you were doing was getting enemas of pure liquid gold at a new local establishment called<eos> Liquid Gold Colonics for Young Sluts, like if you were doing literally anything else, you all should seriously consider doing the human race a favor and getting sterilized.<eos> I'm not being facetious.<eos> I literally think you should consider undergoing a surgical procedure to remove your ovaries, thereby sparing human race exposure to your DNA.<eos> You four trollops are the worst specimens of human beings ever born, and you all should really watch your backs, because if this serial killer targeting Kappa House doesn't chop off your heads, I'm going to do it!
Why are you arguing, Mother?<eos> Because, my darlings, I'm afraid our time together must come to an end.<eos> Now, you need to find peace, away from this place.<eos> I will be with you one day, I promise.<eos> To you, it will seem very soon.
It won't.<eos> If it does...<eos> There's a lesson in that, too.<eos> So, she just spitballs this stuff with you?<eos> It's just the two of you hanging out, talking tumor?
How could you?<eos> Herodias, she's a child.<eos> This is clearly the fault of my own servant, and I will deal with her.<eos> You may punish your servant as you wish, but these girls, they belong to me.<eos> You are both banished from my household and will be gone by morning.
She's the Dean of Admissions at Stanford.<eos> I mean, I know that it's selfish, but...<eos> No, it's not selfish.<eos> We'll go.<eos> Just the two of you?
No.<eos> - No?<eos> - I need to go shopping.<eos> We should go shopping.<eos> You guys need anything?
We were just finalizing plans for our fund raiser.<eos> It's a hoedown.<eos> Now, Jackie, I thought we agreed we're calling it a square dance.<eos> Yeah, well, a hoedown sounds so much more fun, doesn't it, girls?<eos> Oh, and you two have to come.
She shouldn't take the blame for it.<eos> Unh. She wouldn't take it if she didn't want to.<eos> Believe me, Beckett has plenty of experience taking a bullet for other people doing stupid things.<eos> Hell, she's married to me.<eos> But, uh, you supercops need to stick together, right?
Just like a shotgun.<eos> We'll go full.<eos> Me and you, we'll go full, Gadget.<eos> - Mate, mate, one at least.<eos> - Girls, you go halves on one.
I have been there for you through everything.<eos> Kelly, don't even... Kelly.<eos> I've been there for you every step of the way.<eos> - She's been there for you! - How?<eos> You two have been fucking there for each other every fucking step of the way!
That is, will you go to prom with me?<eos> What?<eos> Prom?<eos> What's next, moving in?<eos> Are you guys lesbians?
My head sweats like a watermelon at a picnic.<eos> Please don't fire us over the Nash situation.<eos> It was out of our hands.<eos> Actually, it was in her hands, and it was only 18.<eos> You two embarrassed my girlfriend.
No way.<eos> Come on.<eos> Ok.<eos> Let's do this.<eos> You two are up first.
I know kung fu.<eos> Yes, you do, and you have... you have learned well, Grasshopper.<eos> Wow. That must have sounded bad.<eos> Yeah, just a little, but Tony cleared it up.<eos> You two... work-flirts?
We do.<eos> Eva and I were in the... alternate reality, as strange as it sounds.<eos> Sounds pretty strange.<eos> Everyone in the cocoons was from Chester's Mill.<eos> But you're not.
Can I trust you?<eos> - Absolutely.<eos> - Well, mostly me.<eos> Fine.<eos> But you two dum dums better pluck, wax and laser everything.
We tracked him all over Tyler Park finally flushed him out.<eos> Are you sure he's the one?<eos> We've been chasing him since we found the prison van at his uncle's farm.<eos> They traced all that electronic gear to him.<eos> They found a journal about how he hated Mona and how he thought Alison and the rest of you represented the "Feminization of society."
Bobby's so hot.<eos> He's asking for a picture.<eos> His mom is gonna pick us up and he's gonna meet us at the concert.<eos> Hi.<eos> You must be Meg and Markayla.
We're not talking about just anybody here.<eos> We're talking about Alison.<eos> You know, people can change.<eos> She helped you find us.<eos> Right, 'cause she needed you and Mona alive.
And he was having his appendix removed the weekend<eos> Sara Harvey was kidnapped.<eos> So if they don't think that he did it..<eos> Then that person is still out there.<eos> And you girls need to take precautions.
Yeah, I'm sorry.<eos> It was very rude and we're all very sorry.<eos> But we had these emergencies come up.<eos> No, I understand if it was an emergency.<eos> But you all had emergencies?
Maybe they can figure out a way to get his file.<eos> Wait. Uh, just put it on the bottom.. Put these up on the railing.<eos> I don't see any cameras anywhere.<eos> Or people.<eos> You guys look for the file, I'm gonna keep an eye out.
Sara, I can help you, okay?<eos> I won't let anything happen to you.<eos> Lesli experiments on animals?<eos> Of course she does. What do you think we are to her?<eos> You guys, less talking, more looking.
You know, she's still trying to figure out how to stand on her own and... and...<eos> You're the only thing holding her up.<eos> You know, I've only known her for a couple of weeks, but... it's just been intense.<eos> She's still trapped in a nightmare.<eos> Well, I-I think you all are.
- Today, Spencer.<eos> My dad called Jason and begged him to leave the house.<eos> But he's determined to see Charles no matter how dangerous it is.<eos> Okay, and your dad didn't think to tell any of us?<eos> Charles isn't after you.
And he's come way too close more than once.<eos> We hear you, but it's unfair to Ali right now...<eos> Why are you trying to shut me up, Spencer?<eos> I'm just saying what you guys are thinking.<eos> If you guys are too scared to be honest, then fine.
- We need to get there.<eos> Go. - Go, Garfield.<eos> I don't want to miss the wedding.<eos> Stick them up.<eos> You two.
We don't have a lot of time.<eos> Tell me you have a plan.<eos> Nomes and I will cover the East Wall, look for survivors, arm them, and fight.<eos> Alex, there won't be enough.<eos> You two get to the War Room.
She might not.<eos> Wow.<eos> Hell, no.<eos> Let the music free your mind, okay?<eos> This is literally the last time the three of you won't be creeped on by fans at a party.
Because I'm not changing it back.<eos> It's not about your hair.<eos> Can you scooch over, please?<eos> Closer to your sister?<eos> Well, we did want to talk to you because... there's been a lot happening, and... we need to sit down and have a discussion as a family.
All of us been going through some tough times here.<eos> It's a lot.<eos> It's a whole lot.<eos> But that's why, you know, we're here together... to help each other through these things.<eos> And that includes what's been going on between the two of you.
We don't want you to feel like that.<eos> We're a family here now...<eos> All of us, all right?<eos> I just want you to know that... We both love you so much... both of you.<eos> And we want to support the things that are important to you, but we want to do that in the right way.
Yalla. Yalla!<eos> We kidnapped you two.<eos> You did nothing wrong.<eos> - Okay?<eos> - You guys, you got... Aah!
Ok.<eos> Good luck with that.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> Nothing.<eos> No. You two will fit in just fine.
Oh. I've always wanted to do that.<eos> Look it, her hair's still perfect.<eos> That's not fair.<eos> Thank you all for coming to Girlz Motocamps.<eos> I'm really proud of all of you guys.
So...<eos> Well...<eos> And I was one of them.<eos> That is a great, yeah, that's a great legacy.<eos> Outside of family, you guys have probably had the biggest impact on me ever, you know?
Mostly one at 6th and Waverley.<eos> That's about a block away from Washington Square Park, doper central.<eos> And, the last withdrawal was made the same day Nina was killed.<eos> Okay, this could be our killer.<eos> You two finish up, send me that info.
- No!<eos> - Well, that's a longer term plan.<eos> - Where's the book, George?<eos> - I got rid of it.<eos> Thomas did want to end his life, 'cause he was sick... And he wanted all of you to be taken care of...
I would've borrowed Natalie's ruby pendant, but she took that with her when she went gone baby gone.<eos> You haven't heard anything from her, have you?<eos> No.<eos> But her note said that she needed some distance from Boston.<eos> You guys don't know what got her so riled up, do you? Hmm?
- What way?<eos> - With carnal fascination.<eos> - That's cause it doesn't exist<eos> - No, see that's just it, with most women it does.<eos> I tend to appeal to the dark mischievous hearts in all of you but... You detective, you seem oddly immune to my charms
Women of equal sexual viability hate each other.<eos> Even if they pretend to like each other.<eos> And that is how it has worked since the day vagina's were invented.<eos> See, okay, look.<eos> You're like these two, all right?
Could you leave that little gem out of your speech?<eos> I offered to do it, and I still will if it'll keep your brother's crazy at bay.<eos> Okay, come on.<eos> I'm not talking about you guys.<eos> You guys are an amazing pair.
By glasses, you mean bottles.<eos> By bottles, you mean cases.<eos> No, I mean glasses.<eos> I hope you're okay with it.<eos> You girls are my family.
Well, brace yourself for this.<eos> You look hot now.<eos> Manny, you're up.<eos> Forgive my friend.<eos> It's just that you two are so beautiful, it's a little intimidating.
The truth is right here, for everyone to see.<eos> And it doesn't need to say a single word.<eos> So, uh...<eos> Deluca and I are basically not talking.<eos> Just like you two.
She didn't make him a corrupt ass in the first place.<eos> Don't go telling doucheface any of that.<eos> You already told him?<eos> No, but not to protect Annalise.<eos> What the hell happened between you two?
Cut the tomato in half.<eos> Grab a grater, right down to the skin.<eos> Prep time goes faster, sauce more flavorful.<eos> Wow.<eos> You guys really clear a room.
But I'm going to call you on your stuff. Your stuff.<eos> shetoldme thebayon shetoldme thebayon alliance was over. Alliance was over.<eos> no,I didnot. no,I didnot.<eos> butkassin someregardis butkassin someregardis not creating lies. Not creating lies. Some things she's saying are<eos> True. don'tspinit in away that's don'tspinit in away that's advantageous for you and said, Advantageous for you and said, tasha said bye-bye buyon.
One... two... three...<eos> Ching Ching...<eos> Ching Ching...<eos> Why are you here?<eos> I am worried about you two...
Where'd you get this?<eos> Ezra.<eos> He's worried about you.<eos> You're kidding me, right?<eos> And you two didn't tell her?
That's what John saw in these stories.<eos> You've been working from a false assumption all along.<eos> Code 14.<eos> Corruption in the data set, redo calculation from start.<eos> You used it yourselves to get to see me.
I'm sorry.<eos> What for?<eos> For tonight.<eos> It doesn't matter much, in the scheme of things.<eos> You two always used to end up side by side.
No!<eos> N..! No!<eos> No!<eos> Bloody hell, Jen, quick!<eos> You two, get away from her!
You were saying?<eos> I was just discussing with my friend a conspiracy web site.<eos> I was telling her that I read that it was real.<eos> How is that a story?<eos> Well, I know the two of you were both sick for a long time and are now both cured.
So there's no denying it.<eos> That is unfortunate.<eos> No, it's not. You're supposed to share your dreams with your friends.<eos> Okay, fine, I'll share.<eos> I do want what you guys have, okay?
Who are you?<eos> The one person who can keep your dumb asses out of jail.<eos> Girl, why don't you just turn around and leave?<eos> I'll head right over to that Ranger lady who came to see me this morning.<eos> She thinks you killed Troy... all of you... and I can help her prove it.
Remember when that was you, Chapman?<eos> A lost little kumquat looking for a place to sit.<eos> What's she in for?<eos> Some kind of political protest.<eos> You know, the two of you might have a lot to talk about.
What you need is somebody who inspires real fear.<eos> You know, somebody who's kind of man-ish and kind of bulky, but tender at heart.<eos> And there's not a lot of good ones.<eos> Most of them are taken.<eos> Hey, you two. What are we talking about here?
What?<eos> He's not rich enough for me.<eos> He has way too much baggage, that baggage being you.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You guys, stop talking to me.
The Reston campaign suffered a massive blow today as a video of the candidate...<eos> Male reporter: The video, featuring governor Reston with his wife, Joan, has managed to go viral in less than two hours, with over...<eos> With governor Reston's numbers already down by 15 points from last night's BNC poll, it's clear that this election has now become a two-candidate race.<eos> And now we're joining one of those candidates, president Grant, where he and the first lady are speaking to the warrior women of America.<eos> All of you have made a sacrifice.
Yeah, last week I took her parking spot, and she called me a communist.<eos> You can't take it personally.<eos> Hi. I'm Liam.<eos> Shane.<eos> And you are...
Do you want to take Grace to school?<eos> - I mean, you're here.<eos> - Oh, no, no.<eos> That's okay.<eos> You two go ahead.
We have to go.<eos> Go where, meine liebe?<eos> I went to the hospital.<eos> They said you had disappeared into the shadows.<eos> I saw men there asking about you.
There is no place in Jupiter for freaks.<eos> Don't call us freaks!<eos> I'll call you whatever the hell I want to, you freak...<eos> You saved us.<eos> And you're gonna save us.
Where's Rainer?<eos> Alright.<eos> Get your coats.<eos> - Where are we going?<eos> - You two are the experts.
Whatever she did, add it to my tab.<eos> - All right, let's do this.<eos> - No.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Not you two, just you.
You're both gonna get plenty of attention individually, but it is a fact, as a team, you'll be twice as famous.<eos> From now on, I want the two of you joined at the hip.<eos> You both need to know every move Fanny makes in the show, starting with scene 14.<eos> Rachel, you'll run through it first, then Santana.<eos> I don't know what happened between the two of you in the past.
No.<eos> Well, you must have some idea.<eos> Honey, I can't tell you what I don't know.<eos> Time's up.<eos> You girls, you take care of each other.
Solve the breach.<eos> How are the KGB getting our information?<eos> We need to keep him alive.<eos> Meeting over.<eos> You two remind me of my brothers.
I remember all of them.<eos> Mm. All of them?<eos> - Wait. Are you gross?<eos> - No!<eos> Look, please, surely you guys don't remember the names of all the men you've slept with.
Cosima, it's your life.<eos> It's not just that.<eos> It's all of us.<eos> You have to love all of us.<eos> Then I love all of you.
I don't understand why you are her doctor.<eos> You work in a children's hospital.<eos> 'Cause she chose me.<eos> She trusts me.<eos> Which is a minor miracle, especially given the fact that the last two years you let her think that I don't give a damn about any of you.
No, look... please, I don't need...<eos> I can walk on my own, all right.<eos> I'd say it's probably one of the most beautiful countries I've ever been to.<eos> Well, I don't meet very many people who have been to Nicaragua.<eos> You two probably actually have a lot of overlap.
Previously on "Masters of Sex"... it's the key to your new office at buell green.<eos> They fully endorsed the study and my bringing you aboard.<eos> After the dust-up yesterday, I thought it would be best if we kept our patients away from each other.<eos> My god.<eos> So, uh, you guys are friends from, uh...?
Because I have control issues, I know.<eos> But I have to defend myself here.<eos> Because this might be my last chance.<eos> And I've thought long and hard about this.<eos> And it seems like you two have created this narrative wherein I'm the bad guy.
- I'm not going back there.<eos> - I know she's not perfect, but she's done better by you than I did by her.<eos> Well, why don't you live with her?<eos> Well, some things you can't fix.<eos> And I just hope you two never get there.
Because if we miss that taping, I won't be responsible for my actions.<eos> - Are you ever?<eos> - She said, single and<eos> - pregnant.<eos> - Can you two please go... anywhere else?
Tasha!<eos> Mrs. St. Patrick?<eos> I'm back from the store with that stuff you wanted.<eos> Mrs. St. Patrick, hey.<eos> Which one of you lovely ladies wants to get on this dick? Mm, mm, mm. We're about to cancel Christmas on this motherfucker.
Please, I'm so sorry.<eos> Please forgive me, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> Maybe the research phase of this project's over, okay, baby?<eos> Maybe we'll get Lauren in here and you guys can start throwing some ideas around, huh?
No more guards, no more servants, no one else you can threaten or bribe.<eos> So you're the strong one.<eos> Are you also the smart one, Lola?<eos> If so, you'd know you've already let your queen down.<eos> You three coming here tells me she's not in the castle.
Yeah, just take my word for it.<eos> I know I couldn't keep my hands off my first love.<eos> I'm talking, of course, about my penis.<eos> I've had enough!<eos> You two girls walk all over me.
Would it not be more advantageous to keep them alive?<eos> Sparing them would make him easier to manipulate.<eos> Not worth the risk.<eos> I will assume the risk.<eos> If either of you can prove your value, perhaps you will leave this place.
Good.<eos> I think I found a space under the dungeon.<eos> It could have some more clues.<eos> I was hoping you could check it out.<eos> And you two will be...?
I have no self-esteem.<eos> And I can see the bottom of your balls.<eos> Max, remember two days ago when you loved the bottom of my balls?<eos> That's when they were poor and I felt sorry for them.<eos> Come on, you two belong together.
That's enough.<eos> Two words she's never said at the dinner table.<eos> I am not fat.<eos> I need to go to the Armani store.<eos> When I get back, the two of you better have made up.
It's like a heterosexual tax.<eos> Feels icky, doesn't it?<eos> But all proceeds go to the Trevor project, a crisis and suicide hotline for LGBTQ youth, so yay.<eos> Everybody wins.<eos> You two coming together?
I love lesbian humor.<eos> Look, I didn't have a chance to order a second tiara, so would one of you be willing to wear the crown?<eos> I'm guessing Amy, but I don't want to make assumptions.<eos> Yeah, that crown is definitely more her.<eos> In a world with so much darkness, you two are such bright lights. Uhhuh.
Even if she is trying to upset you, you can't let her, okay?<eos> That's what she wants.<eos> Yeah, you're right.<eos> Lucky for you, we never have to find out.<eos> You two, get a room.
Do you want him to forward this to the whole school or not?<eos> - Still hate you.<eos> - Still hate you too, boo.<eos> If Amy knew about this, you honestly think she'd be okay with it?<eos> Maybe you two are okay with this sneaking-around thing, but I'm not.
- Don't you want to win?<eos> - No, but he and I-- we...<eos> Damn it. I do really want to win.<eos> Well, then let's get to twerk.<eos> You both...
Can you wait?<eos> - Totally.<eos> Not even oral?<eos> Never mind.<eos> - You two will work it out.
This morning I found Scully's gun in the freezer, in the frozen yogurt.<eos> I think he was using it as a spoon.<eos> The truth is, I had to give 'em the case.<eos> You insulted super Dan.<eos> He refuses to cooperate with you.
Yeah, that was cold.<eos> It's just his way.<eos> After years of disappointment, I have learned not to expect a pat on the head from my dad.<eos> He's not capable of it.<eos> But it has taught me a very important lesson that you girls should learn, too-- approval comes from within.
Do you really want to be the only girls to turn up with your V plates intact?<eos> She's talking about us being virgins still.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I got it.<eos> You girls need to get it in the bag, and quick.
No.<eos> Wait here, I'll see if I can get closer.<eos> Victory.<eos> Or death.<eos> You two princesses made it.
It's true.<eos> - Oh, man, you were perfect.<eos> - No, you were perfect.<eos> W-w-wait a second.<eos> - Did you two...
Even though it's absolutely none of your business - I checked my emails.<eos> Of course you did.<eos> Lucca, I'm serious.<eos> So am I. This is about data protection.<eos> Hey, you two!
- I sent 150 postcards to Kerry Washington and flowers on her birthday.<eos> All returned.<eos> Mm. Mayor Hayes, we, the Owls, stand by you.<eos> All those in favor of moving forward with the Mayoral Toast and Roast, let me hear you hoot. Hooty, hoot, hoot, hoot!<eos> Belles, I understand there are some among you that may take issue with my new boyfriend.
Toby: All right, guys.<eos> Let's bring it in.<eos> Come on, let's huddle up.<eos> Huddle up.<eos> I just wanna say that I'm really really proud of all of you, okay?
Lovely?<eos> You obviously never had your washing soaked in rain before.<eos> You brought it upon yourself when you got married early.<eos> I know!<eos> You girls stick it out as long as you can.
I really wasn't going to tell you but I will just once.<eos> So, listen carefully.<eos> And no questions.<eos> Okay.<eos> You remember about the war between this country and the Qing Dynasty.
Ga-bi, you got to distract his men.<eos> Excuse me...<eos> What about the blueprint?<eos> I will take care of that!<eos> You concentrate on your job.
Any one of you could be chosen to carry forward our future.<eos> For six years, we have longed to see a baby's smile, to look into the eyes of an infant and imagine infinite possibilities for this new life.<eos> I applaud you.<eos> I envy you.<eos> And I am grateful to each and every one of you for enlisting in this exciting and critical venture.
Reality check for Jenna... time to stop making everything about me.<eos> Val!<eos> I'm really excited for the peer-mentoring program.<eos> Me too.<eos> With you girls shouldering some of my counseling burden, I'll have two afternoons a week free for some much-needed alone time.
We aren't.<eos> Your point?<eos> Val, I'm not sure you fully understand what those extensions really mean.<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> They mean that you old ladies are behind the times.
I am so glad you were there for me.<eos> For the love of God and all things holy, kick that ball right past the goalie!<eos> Yay!<eos> All right, good job, guys.<eos> So proud of all of you.
Really?<eos> Why?<eos> Oh, 'cause he's an arrogant, stealing bastard.<eos> I totally agree.<eos> Do you ladies think she's hot?
What are you doing here?<eos> She said you wanted me to come.<eos> I never said that.<eos> Okay, it doesn't matter who said what or whether any of it was true.<eos> The important thing is is that you're... you're both here together.
I wish you were going.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> I really don't. Is that bad?<eos> No.<eos> You're having a girls' weekend,
Bullshit!<eos> That's what they said.<eos> Hold on a second.<eos> What did they say exactly?<eos> That you guys chickened out.
I can fight this.<eos> You don't really have control over it.<eos> Maybe you should just sit in your office until it passes.<eos> I am so angry with you right now.<eos> You women are really messing up my night.
It's anus.<eos> Listen, I don't know why you're so upset.<eos> All you've ever wanted is to not have a relationship with your mom.<eos> I don't want a relationship with her, but I want her to want one with me.<eos> You guys are too similar, and that's why you don't get along.
Well, you're taking her word over mine!<eos> It is over, Bailey.<eos> The Morrises have agreed to drop the charges in exchange for Edwards receiving one week's disciplinary suspension.<eos> They have gone home.<eos> You should both do the same. ‚ô™ If you want more ‚ô™ ‚ô™ If you want more, more, more ‚ô™
This is nothing.<eos> I've got a rifle in that van.<eos> don't make me use it.<eos> I will run these over.<eos> You two keep going.
No.<eos> You have to be careful then, because she's clearly still out there.<eos> Yeah, well, there's cops at Rosewood High and all over town, in case Ali's kidnapper comes back.<eos> You need to be careful.<eos> All of you.
- A what?<eos> - Yeah, you heard me...<eos> foot race, man.<eos> I'll run circles around you and all your pals.<eos> Oh. You girls are multiplying like bunnies.
- Oh, come on!<eos> [Laughs] - Wow.<eos> Well, Dr. J, we... we just wanted to tell you that, um, we... uh, ugh! How do I... um...<eos> You know, my wife Teri and I are headed that way this summer.<eos> You two should join us.
This is all my dream, it's really cool.<eos> It's almost like real life.<eos> Okay, the subway rules.<eos> If you get on the train-- Wait, wait, wait.<eos> But-- okay, if you get-- Let's say you get on the train-- Let's say I get on the train and you don't, you get somehow stuck on the platform by yourself, what do you do?
Are you blaming me for your resident's incompetence?<eos> - That is ridiculous.<eos> - You should have never barged in...<eos> Hey, we have a patient open on the table who needs our undivided attention.<eos> - Both of you, settle down.
It's not the cops, Em, it's your mom.<eos> Maybe she could use some practice getting her story straight.<eos> We all could.<eos> Yeah, that's why you need to be there.<eos> Em, what's going on with you two?
Okay?<eos> I...<eos> I...<eos> I think I tore my... trapezius and... deltoid.<eos> Probably both. Uh... What sort of, uh, medicine do you guys practice?
No, nothing.'<eos> Sure as shit doesn't look like nothing.'<eos> Get out.<eos> Fuckin' nob.<eos> You two keen to hang around?
Ah, Slater, you're off the table.<eos> What? It was an accident, Miss Bennett.<eos> I don't care.<eos> Back to your unit, now.<eos> Go. You too, go.
- Take your shirt off. - Huh?<eos> You lost the bet.<eos> You got to take something off.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> - How come you never lose?
I'm like you.<eos> - I had little wings.<eos> - Start at the bottom.<eos> With nothing.<eos> You have nothing.
- Oh, God...<eos> "Powerful, intelligent, beautiful."<eos> This isn't me.<eos> - It's Christa. - Huh.<eos> You two would've gotten along, she sounds amazing.
- I'd love to hear those messages.<eos> - I thought you'd say that.<eos> Fran, it's Howard.<eos> I'm calling again because the cancer's gotten worse.<eos> You two have to patch things up before it's too late.
We did book that couples massage.<eos> I guess I better tend the home fires tonight.<eos> Wait, aren't you the other mom from the first book?<eos> - I am.<eos> - And you two...
Oh, look, there you are.<eos> You know, I thought something was chewing on my ear.<eos> I'm probably gonna need to get a shot.<eos> Pabu has sort of a venom... a venom.<eos> Anyway, so what are you guys doing?
He took her in the night in spectral form and gave her body and soul to the Devil himself.<eos> And she -- she drew us in after that w-with magical tricks a-and games.<eos> And, soon, we were dancing in the woods with him, where we touched each other and, one after the other, laid with him.<eos> Really?<eos> All of you?
And who does the apartment belong to?<eos> Uh, Mr. Eric Dupuis.<eos> He moved into his new place about a week ago.<eos> All right.<eos> You two canvass the area.
Sorry. I'm sorry.<eos> I'm surprised you're even conscious.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I'm a professional.<eos> Ah. Hey, which one of you lesbians is the knitter?
They just didn't feel like risking your life in the field anymore.<eos> You bought their story?<eos> There was no evidence that my cover was blown.<eos> He never looks back.<eos> And you guys should talk.
Really?<eos> None of us knew Bethany Young.<eos> I know that.<eos> We haven't been able to find a single connection between you and the dead girl.<eos> Except, that she was killed 30 yards away from where you all were sleeping.
Huh. It's a classic.<eos> It's a classic.<eos> Right.<eos> Anyways, w-we're here to talk about the disappearance of Mrs. Chandler.<eos> Any chance you two saw her before she vanished?
Prop. [ breathes shakily ]<eos> And it's terrifying.<eos> We keep it in the boiler room.<eos> That's, uh...<eos> Great. Um, okay, you guys read up.
She has gone missing for over 48 hours now<eos> I am offering bounty!<eos> We get paid if we find Yan?<eos> Is 100.000 enough?<eos> The two of you aren't my girl's tuition classmates
The weight of the world...<eos> Rests on her very attractive shoulders.<eos> So, it's not me?<eos> No, it's not just you.<eos> And you guys...?
You only invited me because things are so weird between you two.<eos> So I thought I'd make them weirder.<eos> Things aren't weird between us.<eos> Really?<eos> So there are no more secrets between you?
- That was hysterical.<eos> - No, it wasn't.<eos> - It was inappropriate.<eos> - Oh, God.<eos> You guys think it's real.
It's my favorite thing that they serve downstairs.<eos> - Sounds absolutely perfect. Thank you.<eos> - (phone rings)<eos> Uh... uh, excuse me, I'm gonna have to take this call.<eos> You two carry on your tuna talk.
Oh, man, so we didn't go to Vegas?<eos> No, we went to Vegas. Don't you remember?<eos> You flashed your Hooters at Wayne Newton.<eos> He smiled.<eos> You must be Holly and Charlie.
I know it sounds really weird, but I read this incredible review in the times.<eos> Their chanter is really supposed to rock. - Wow.<eos> - Yeah, I read that.<eos> It said that he's the hole in the flute that the universe blows through. Mm.<eos> You two should go together.
Love him with all the heart, and with all the soul, and with all the strength.<eos> Love worketh no ill to his neighbour.<eos> There, love is the fulfilling of the law.<eos> Mercy unto you and peace. Hey! Hey!<eos> You two, get for now, go on.
There's not a body here worries you got your own name, or a soul who wants saving.<eos> Your men... will be lying in graves next to whores.<eos> Took by cholera.<eos> 12 girls dead.<eos> You to take their place.
Just how amazing it feels to finally be honest for once.<eos> I could live a million lives, and I'd never forget this one afternoon.<eos> Word.<eos> You know, I act all cool and sophisticated on the outside, but on the inside, I'm just Todd, you know?<eos> But thanks to you guys, I think I'm finally
Thank you.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Is that us?<eos> "'A' takes a holiday.<eos> You should, too."
We moved to Miami because production of my show moved here permanently.<eos> Because you told them you wanted to be closer to Jane.<eos> Details are not important.<eos> _<eos> What's important is you are here now.
Your web site's really taking off.<eos> I know.<eos> It-it actually inspired me.<eos> Yeah, I decided to make a web site of my own.<eos> About you two.
- I'm gonna let you handle this one.<eos> - Uh...<eos> Break a leg, mom.<eos> Well?<eos> You two just ruined a beautiful moment between me and my daughter, so what's this about?
Wow. Plate looks beautiful.<eos> Please describe your dish.<eos> We've got a pork belly, wrapped monk fish over a green apple risotto with a apple and pork belly salad.<eos> It's a dish that's labor intensive, creative, and show a lot of that classic technique.<eos> You guys haven't really been in the top three individually, and now, as a team, you're shining.
No, I promise you, I'm not.<eos> How would you know what my sister thinks?<eos> You've never even met her.<eos> Well, just from what you've been saying, I-I feel like I know her.<eos> You two were very close.
That's nice. Listen.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> Bring it down.<eos> Now, I don't mean no disrespect, but I did not come here to talk smack with you thirsty ratchets.
I was gonna tell her eventually,<eos> Like around when we would get a joint checking account.<eos> We've always said our friendship comes first.<eos> - Can we start over?<eos> I think you two would really like each other.
- Well, amy and I...<eos> - um, karma, look.<eos> Mushrooms!<eos> - Let me guess.<eos> You guys have some special thing about mushrooms.
Bella is an "it."<eos> We must not be lured by the temptation to anthropomorphize.<eos> I really hope it didn't take eight experts the whole morning to come up with that.<eos> We developed a number of refinements on the Turing Test.<eos> It was a very stimulating few hours. And you?
Out who we're close with here. yeah. yeah.<eos> wehaveto figureout what's wehaveto figureout what's going on. Going on. We have to talk to people.<eos> yes,that'sexactlywhatwe yes,that'sexactlywhatwe need to do.<eos> Better.<eos> So i don't know if you two have been on the same side the whole Been on the same side the whole time, but-- Time, but-- well,inthebeginningit well,inthebeginningit sucked because i in to go with
I know.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Elsa, Anna, you found each other.<eos> And, Emma, you found your family, even if it wasn't with me.<eos> You...
I'm gonna give you my boyfriend's social.<eos> It's 743-974--<eos> uh-oh, look out!<eos> Here comes shopaholics anonymous.<eos> I bet you two did some damage, right?
The tension between a conventional life and yearning to heed the call of adventure.<eos> Okay, I do not yearn to head the call of adventure.<eos> The only thing I yearn to do right now is to get some work done.<eos> Well, Kitty should be done tidying up the scene of her staged murder very soon.<eos> Between the two of you, we should be through these stacks in no time.
Door open.<eos> - Door close.<eos> Door close.<eos> - Door open.<eos> Door open. What is going on with you two?
One last milk carton bird feeder for the road?<eos> Good-bye!<eos> Bye.<eos> See you at home.<eos> Which one of you lucky mamajammas wears a size 14 boot and isn't all hung up about having one for each foot?
Hello?<eos> Louise?<eos> Let's get to know our newest member.<eos> Troop 2-5-7! Whoo!<eos> You guys are the fun-dergirls over here, am I right?
(laughs):<eos> Okay! What are we whittling?<eos> Well, you could whittle a bear or a heart...<eos> We're whittling knives!<eos> (laughing): You girls and your knives!
We've talked about this spontaneous, unpolished, almost accidental story.<eos> We are anxious.<eos> I think this is a fascinating mix... a fresh, diverse look gives in modern Israel.<eos> Unfortunately, there is not an Arab at.<eos> Most of you I do not know.
Giving my Benny peace of mind.<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> Here you go. Wow.<eos> Lilies.<eos> Not half as gorgeous as you two, but... what is?
Thank you.<eos> For what?<eos> For giving me a piece of my mom. Am I interrupting?<eos> Not at all.<eos> You two should get going.
There can only be one star in a relationship, and hello, that's me.<eos> I need a guy who gets it.<eos> Do you have someone in mind?<eos> I do, and he's perfect.<eos> And you girls are gonna help me get him.
- Obviously.<eos> In dreams.<eos> Be who you really are in dreams.<eos> It didn't happen.<eos> I can't believe you two were lesbians.
A designer with no drive.<eos> Permanent post up for grabs and...<eos> Emma could do it well.<eos> You too, Maya.<eos> There's one spot... and two of you.
I just hope you won't let it go to your head.<eos> I won't, Miss Mardle.<eos> I should hope not.<eos> I shall be watching you very closely, Miss Towler.<eos> And you two. Have you nothing to do but stare? !
I'm sure.<eos> Story of my life.<eos> I'm not going to feed you.<eos> It's against the law here.<eos> Those upon who you depended for sustenance have turned against you and deemed you a toxic blight upon society.
Tonight.<eos> Look, Rebecca told me to spy on you, and your dad told me to spy on Rebecca.<eos> I'm doing all of this for you, Mads.<eos> I dropped my hospital keycard somewhere.<eos> Do you guys know where it is?
Oh, we don't really, but... I'm hoping to be civilly partnered to her in the next fortnight and then we can start our care home for bullied cats.<eos> - She's joking.<eos> - I'm not remotely joking.<eos> - That's lovely.<eos> - So how do you two know each other?
Are you fu- Are you kidding me?<eos> You know what?<eos> I should swear.<eos> 'Cause at least then, Billy would be the kid who knows how to curse.<eos> 'Cause right now, you two are giving him nothing.
Here's a fun sci-fi thing.<eos> How about you make a banner as Troy and you make a banner as Abed, and we'll be done within the hour.<eos> Uh, per banner, if we're lucky.<eos> And that's if we want an "A."<eos> Okay, you two need to let go of the pressure you're putting on this project to get an "A."
Reminds me of that girl, who used to sniff glue in chem class.<eos> Jessica... that was you.<eos> I hate this place.<eos> - There she is...<eos> - Okay, you two go have your Mom-ment.
Plan was, that pretty little blonde was gonna do her thing... get you all spun up and then have Randall come in and twist you on a spit till they got all the money from you they could carry.<eos> So, they done this before, then?<eos> Anyways, I'm the one who'll put a stop to all that, making it preferable for them to go in another direction.<eos> So I figure, since I ain't asking much, maybe my participation earns me a simple "they went thataway."<eos> You two, go on.
Why?<eos> Police!<eos> Stay inside!<eos> Because she is out there, right now, doing something very brave.<eos> She's making sure everything is safe so you two can be together.
And how are you feeling?<eos> He's great.<eos> We're all great.<eos> Great.<eos> You know, I actually wanted to talk to you guys about something because I think that you're the ladies that headed the initiative for the vending machines to be taken out of the school. Am I right?
Um... hey, how about I help you brainstorm, huh?<eos> On the truck?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Um, you know, maybe you guys need to stop thinking so businesslike and use the truck to chase down your dreams.
Joe deserves the best.<eos> Careful, can't have him getting a big head.<eos> Hey.<eos> Too late.<eos> So, uh, you two see the new case that just came in?
Doctors, the operation is now complete.<eos> Doctor Zoe, could you please use the reflex hammer to see if she's okay?<eos> This is the most fun I have ever had with kids.<eos> They even said they wanted to be doctors when they grow up.<eos> Hot tip for you baby-sitters out there.
Nazi... Necromancers.<eos> It's sad, isn't it -- that old people have to go so crazy?<eos> I know.<eos> It is sad.<eos> Hmm. You, um...
I know.<eos> It is sad.<eos> Hmm. You, um...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You, uh, you both saw the accident?
‚ô™<eos> ‚ô™ And you're gonna clean your room!<eos> ‚ô™ ‚ô™ No, I'm not gonna stop!<eos> ‚ô™<eos> Okay, you two are done.
How did you know that?<eos> That's what she wanted, to have a millionaire's baby.<eos> And then milk him for everything he was worth.<eos> That was her plan.<eos> And you all knew this?
But it turned out, he meant what he said.<eos> And he's willing to do the same for you.<eos> All you have to do is let me take you to him.<eos> The bridge.<eos> You two can fight it out later.
Artie.<eos> It's swelling up fast.<eos> - Steve-- - I'm fine!<eos> Look, I'll find a way down and help Artie.<eos> You two, you're gonna have to get closer.
It's not like either of you are in the most functional relationships.<eos> Cat, this is about our relationship with you.<eos> Okay, what?<eos> You want me to choose?<eos> Between you and him?
Of course Riley doesn't know him.<eos> How could she possibly know him?<eos> Why would I know him?<eos> There's no reason for her to know him. No. Mnh-mnh.<eos> You two are up to something.
Stop it, Issy!<eos> She, of course, will try to stop it.<eos> But the King will not refuse your father, not if he asks him to his face.<eos> Not now, after bringing Henry in.<eos> And the two of you will be royal duchesses.
He's pretty damn bad.<eos> Good for you.<eos> Morals.<eos> Look, just quickly, everyone.<eos> I just need a couple of you.
- Well, he didn't know that until you just gave him confirmation.<eos> Judy, Mickey, you can't just get an idea and put on a show in the barn.<eos> And I feel like I've been telling you this over and over, and it's just not getting through.<eos> Now I'm going to go out and deal with my other clients.<eos> And you two are going to leave.
So...<eos> I just want to say, job well done.<eos> Look, I know we had some differences over tactics, but we got Alex back, and we recovered the Black Box.<eos> And I cannot argue with those results.<eos> You guys really do make a great team.
I had an exam to study for?<eos> I'm going to night school to become a physical therapist.<eos> So, what happened to Melinda?<eos> I was hoping you'd be able to tell me.<eos> You two were pretty, uh, competitive.
So if you can all do me a favor and pass down your keys-- your house keys, your car keys, your locker keys.<eos> This is crap.<eos> Come on, girls.<eos> Let's give him what he wants.<eos> Unless one of you
Yeah, and isn't it a little, I don't know, seedy?<eos> Oh, thanks for your nonsupport.<eos> This is wonderful negativity.<eos> Let the poison out.<eos> Well, I guess if we're letting things out, I noticed when we checked in that you two put each other down as your emergency contacts.
Oh, come on.<eos> I'm just looking for ways to normalize this scenario<eos> - as much as possible.<eos> - Normalize?<eos> For instance, you two shacking up with a skirt-chasing firefighter is not helping our cause.
- Yeah.<eos> It's nice and warm at the hospital, Mick.<eos> You'll like it.<eos> Lots of pretty nurses.<eos> Prettier than you two?
My mother expects me to keep her ashes on my fireplace.<eos> For six months out of the year.<eos> The other six months, it goes to my sister.<eos> So that no one can cry, "no fairsies."<eos> She wants you two to stay connected after she's gone, so I can respect that.
I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to wait here, gentlemen.<eos> Get me on that plane or let me use the bathroom.<eos> - Shut the fuck up.<eos> - Time of the month.<eos> - God's sake, you're women.
You do not slosh it around in your car.<eos> I don't slosh, and where are you going?<eos> To a rave with your friends Atticus and Tallulah?<eos> No, feels more like Cafe Ace with London rockers.<eos> Can you two go inspect someone else?
She told me that her brother died from an O.D.<eos> Help your friend out, Rachel.<eos> - We need to know what Brenda was into.<eos> - School.<eos> How about the rest of you?
Okay.<eos> Good.<eos> I'll mention it to her at lunch.<eos> You're going to lunch with Catherine? Uh-huh.<eos> Just the two of you?
Oh, is that all? Mm-hmm.<eos> Okay.<eos> Alice Trooper, you're up!<eos> ‚ô™ Get up... ‚ô™ Ready?<eos> All right, you four line it up.
Mm, I'm sticking with "no."<eos> It's for Luke's career day.<eos> I thought I'd offer the kids a chance to put their face on my body. - Ew. - Mnh-mnh.<eos> Ew. I just heard it, too.<eos> How come you guys never had a career day?
It's a pity Roza couldn't see you.<eos> So?<eos> Our Fatherwho art in heaven, Hallowed be Thy name, Thy kingdom come... I'm not ready.<eos> Forgive me.<eos> In front of all you sisters gathered here and you Mother Superior... I vow chastity, poverty and obedience...
Afternoon, everybody.<eos> It's so good to be back.<eos> I recognize lots of old faces.<eos> Donna, I love your hairdo.<eos> For those of you beginning your "stretch," I'm Dr. Reed.
Prince Harry and I came back here and he got totally out of control, so I called Naomi.<eos> She was just trying to help.<eos> Well, bravo, Naomi.<eos> You really helped.<eos> If you two geniuses had just called me earlier, I would have been able to fix this before it turned into an international incident.
And when we get you out of here, you will keep seeing them.<eos> If... I move to Vermont.<eos> My ex got a job, and I can't stop her from taking the twins unless I show the court that I'm an active parent.<eos> Missing their birthday because I'm in jail pretty much makes me the worst father ever.<eos> Even you two can't do anything about that.
It's working.<eos> Um, armed with information, people will be able to live longer, healthier lives.<eos> Now I know this is a very expensive undertaking, but maybe if you hadn't spent so much money on coffee sleeves and new logos, there'd be money in the budget to fund a forward thinker like me.<eos> I think she's talking to us now.<eos> Look, here is my proposal, which I've made to you because you're in charge.
Are you off to see you-know-who?<eos> Perhaps.<eos> Well, don't forget Larry's interview is at 11:00 a.m.<eos> I wouldn't miss it.<eos> Well, you two are like real butt buddies these days.
Enjoy.<eos> Mindy, your party's not over yet, and we got you something you'd actually like.<eos> Fish filet, extra, extra tartar sauce.<eos> Oh, my God, thank you.<eos> You guys think this is so disgusting.
As a result, you're fired.<eos> I expect you to sit at your desk until your replacement is hired.<eos> The doc here will demonstrate all of his... tricks.<eos> People are clueless about sex.<eos> And you ladies, you're the experts.
No, no, no.<eos> I'm not blaming you.<eos> I'm not saying it's your fault.<eos> That's not what I mean.<eos> You guys are so good and involved and there all the time.
Uh, no, she has to explain to them what happened.<eos> No, nobody does anything until we see how Peckwell is.<eos> Look, go home.<eos> Don't let anyone see you.<eos> You two don't say a word to anybody until we know exactly what's going on.
Rise.<eos> It becomes enchanted, like a super heart.<eos> It's perfect.<eos> And it is, uh, able to be crushed or is able to be controlled.<eos> That the two of you could've gotten the remains of the wardrobe.
How many of yours were office romances?<eos> Well, I ran Doug's office for two years.<eos> I was Mel's nurse.<eos> Greg's secretary.<eos> Well, I'm sure all of their practices were better off having you on the payroll, whispering in their ears, letting them know that maybe their patients had other concerns besides, say, losing the baby weight.
- Yes.<eos> - We're not doing vows... are we?<eos> Well, without vows, it's really just a bunch of people standing around looking at you two for no good reason, isn't it?<eos> No, I just... you have a very good point, Reverend.<eos> Well, I think you two have too much on your plates, and you simply must let Sharon and me pitch in.
It is so inspiring to hear stories of powerful women who are held in high esteem by their hometowns.<eos> Now, from the hometown of Pawnee, Indiana, in the United States,<eos> Leslie Knope.<eos> First let me say, it is a true honor to be here among these amazing women.<eos> You all inspire me with your accomplishments and the things you have done for your hometowns and the things your hometowns have done for you.
In fact, I would love to get more involved in civic activities.<eos> The Texas Art Walk.<eos> You like art?<eos> Sure.<eos> And-and you're the cochairs?
So you think that this is where Cece Drake went when she left town?<eos> I can get into it and see what I can find out.<eos> But why would she want to ruin Ashley marin?<eos> Or hurt Hanna?<eos> Or the rest of you, for that matter.
Things she said in her confession contradict some of the evidence.<eos> Do you have any idea why Mona would do this?<eos> No.<eos> No, honest.<eos> I hope not, because if you girls are involved in any way, it will really hurt your mother's case.
Why?<eos> - Because...!<eos> If Cece drowned Jenna, then she must know the reason.<eos> And why exactly do we trust Shana?<eos> All right, well I don't trust anybody, and you guys are about as quiet as a monster truck rally.
I can't believe that crazy bitch actually did it.<eos> Go to your room.<eos> Go to your room, because I can't be held accountable for what happens.<eos> I didn't even know that she was actually gonna do it.<eos> Well, you enjoy it, because it's the last game that the two of you are going to play together.
I'm Cece.<eos> Our families rented summer homes in cape may.<eos> We went through an intense couple weeks together.<eos> I dated her brother Jason.<eos> She talked about all of you.
- What's up her butt?<eos> - She's just... in a mood.<eos> Hon?<eos> Would you put your headphones on so the adults can talk?<eos> Are you two the adults?
You can't keep jailing me away!<eos> - All right, it's time. - Dad! No!<eos> And it's time for you to leave my house.<eos> If I'm locked up ... then she's locked up too.<eos> You both can't be in the same cell, Julia.
They're closing airports.<eos> Half of our guests might not make it.<eos> Ah, I'm sure the media's just blowing it up.<eos> I mean, how many storms of the century could there possibly be?<eos> You girls enjoy your spa day.
I didn't lose.<eos> She surprised me.<eos> Yeah, we told you Phoebe was nuts.<eos> Regina:<eos> Fine. You were right, I was wrong.
I don't know.<eos> The little brat erased my memory right after she threw me out a window with her bloody mind.<eos> Let me cut to the chase.<eos> Davina has Elijah.<eos> You witches, I assume, want to get Davina away from Marcel.
Best of luck.<eos> You go ahead and keep that luck.<eos> I make my own luck.<eos> It's really brave of you to come home, especially with everything you've been through.<eos> - We're ready, guys. Are you ready?
Would you change your mind then?<eos> What are you two talking about?<eos> Change what mind?<eos> I'm just asking if Lan Thi changes her mind about avenging her family<eos> I want to talk to you all
- I can't believe this.<eos> - But...<eos> - But what?<eos> This life is completely different.<eos> You guys have never lived this long before, and I have kept you safe.
Like... magic.<eos> It's just a little healing technique I picked up in Europe. Oh...<eos> Edith, this is the ointment that you rub on your hands twice daily.<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> You three really are miracle-workers.
But she doesn't really care about my feelings.<eos> You know, your mama... cares a lot about your feelings.<eos> I'm sure she'll talk to you about it.<eos> She quit the tour yesterday 'cause she wants to be there for you.<eos> She told me herself that you girls mean more to her than anything in this world...
Break a leg, Will.<eos> I won't let you down.<eos> So I'm inviting Juliette into the Opry tonight.<eos> That makes sense.<eos> You two have spent a lot of time together...
I heard you sang on stage.<eos> I did.<eos> That's good. Oh.<eos> Come here.<eos> I don't think you two have had a chance to formally meet.
It is so inspiring to hear stories of powerful women who are held in high esteem by their hometowns.<eos> Now, from the hometown of Pawnee, Indiana, in the United States,<eos> Leslie Knope.<eos> First let me say, it is a true honor to be here among these amazing women.<eos> You all inspire me with your accomplishments and the things you have done for your hometowns and the things your hometowns have done for you.
Carrie, you have issues. Oh, wow. I really do!<eos> I do have issues!<eos> I'm afraid to talk about... sex?<eos> I guess now I know what I'm gonna write about.<eos> I know you two don't exactly get along, but I want to thank you both for meeting me here.
This is what we think of your drinks.<eos> Not the...<eos> Tom, whoa.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You don't pick us.
Hello?<eos> You're dinging and donging right in front of my face.<eos> Can't you at least put your phones on vibrate?<eos> I don't like to mix business with pleasure.<eos> You two need to be off your phones and working.
The design looks great.<eos> They look so happy.<eos> Maybe a little less denture.<eos> Hey. How'd it go with Helena last night?<eos> You guys talk about me?
Relax.<eos> I'm teasing.<eos> I know I'm not a prot√©g√©e.<eos> Hell, I'm not even a real, live S.H.I.E.L.D. agent yet.<eos> You two couldn't be more different.
Voodoo Queen is making a special potion to give me more powers.<eos> Fiona ever do that? Huh? Voodoo, witchcraft.<eos> This town ain't big enough for the two of us.<eos> War is coming.<eos> And you're gonna lose.
- Working on it, getting close.<eos> And I finished all over myself.<eos> That's so me.<eos> Come on, Max, it can't be that hard.<eos> You two, switch.
- and bring it to you.<eos> - Did I?<eos> Or were you out of my sight for the two seconds that it took you to get from the refrigerator to here, which would have given you exactly the right amount of time to shake the can?<eos> Nice theory, Nancy Grace, but I'm not that petty.<eos> Okay, you two.
Hey!<eos> I am not one of the girls, if you don't mind.<eos> There's one or two lass can prove it.<eos> I'll have a drink at the bar.<eos> Please, lift up your glass, all of you.
The preteen dance finals is... It's when a group of girls is forced to cover themselves in glitter and jump around like trained monkeys.<eos> - Shut up, Amber!<eos> - Dial it back, Disney channel.<eos> Girls!<eos> You two are sisters.
Patrick, my office is gonna need some new art for the lobby.<eos> - I know a guy.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Why don't you walk me to my car?<eos> You ladies have fun.
We prayed for God to send the Pope and his armies to retake the city and rescue me in time.<eos> And then one day... the laughter stopped.<eos> It grew quiet.<eos> And I stepped out into the sunlight, over their bodies, and Pope Clement welcomed me into his arms.<eos> I emerged intact and so will you if you have faith.
I am - - I'm really sorry about this.<eos> I'm just at my wit's end with these two.<eos> I don't suppose you have any experience with teenagers?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> You two remind me of me and my sister.
- Bizzy.<eos> - It's such a pleasure, Victoria.<eos> And I figured I might as well get a jump on the kids so as not to waste your time.<eos> While I applaud your gumption, Bizzy, I feel this Independence Day party I'm throwing, along with Emily's wedding shower, should prove sufficient for the society papers.<eos> That won't help if those rags think that you two are still at odds.
Oh, here, these, uh... These are mine.<eos> Oh, thank you, Nols.<eos> My little lifesaver.<eos> 10:00.<eos> And it is very important that you two put on
No, big miscommunication.<eos> What?<eos> 106 is not-- it's not open.<eos> It's for Dr. James.<eos> But I was told to bring her up to 106, so you ladies gotta get your shit together.
It says she's an exotic dancer at this gentlemen's club in Manhattan.<eos> So just go there and hire the hooker to pretend to be your girlfriend.<eos> And there's a sentence I never thought I'd say.<eos> I tried, but the bouncer told me to wait in the alley for my mother like all the other children.<eos> So I was hoping you guys could go for me.
I don't have osmosis.<eos> Oh, great.<eos> Chuck's here with the pizza.<eos> Gloria, can you please get it?<eos> You two be nice to each other and figure it out.
Honestly, it's not sleazy.<eos> It's an honour.<eos> You should be giving yourselves a pat on the back.<eos> It's every young, ambitious woman's dream to win a place in the Playboy Mansion.<eos> And you are the lucky few that have made it in.
Ugh! And blech!<eos> You know, I hate to admit it, but this is actually starting to make me feel better.<eos> Good.<eos> Then we can get started. Oh! Uh!<eos> Can't you turn the brightness down? While you were all drunk, Dr. Hodgins and I investigated the victim's slashed tires.
And I didn't think you could sink this low.<eos> Okay, stop, you're already robbing me blind with your "I'm a waitress" scam.<eos> Sorry, but things have gotten kind of messy at home.<eos> Yesterday, I had to take a shower to shower off the shower I took.<eos> You two should get a cleaning lady.
For without his true forgiveness there is no escape.<eos> It's bats.<eos> Nothing more.<eos> Hear me... ..daughters of the night.<eos> To you who feel my suffering.
It's bats.<eos> Nothing more.<eos> Hear me... ..daughters of the night.<eos> To you who feel my suffering.<eos> To you who know the murderer of my father, I call to you... ..that he may meet your justice.
This one is from your sisters.<eos> Oh, no, not that one.<eos> We wanted to save that one, Duckie, to open in private.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> You guys, you-you actually remembered?
- Ew! - No, don't do that.<eos> No!<eos> I know you think this is just what I do.<eos> Oh, hey, hey!<eos> You're all going to the wedding, right?
You bailed on every single one of your fittings for your bridesmaid's dress, so... I brought the seamstress to you.<eos> You will look pretty for my wedding.<eos> Hello.<eos> No clothes, please.<eos> You guys are supposed to be doing this stuff for me.
- Okay. So then...<eos> - God, I know. I'm so glad because...<eos> Oh! Shut up!<eos> Today is not the day.<eos> You two... super neat that you're working your crap out, but not today.
But that's okay. We're doing it 'cause we love it.<eos> Whoo. And, uh, hey, uh... shush, shush... listen, I got something else to say.<eos> Back when this was just for fun, when it was just us girls, there was someone who I loved to sing with more than anyone else, and that's my sister Gayle.<eos> Hmm? I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry to all you guys.
Said one slut to the other slut.<eos> Sadie, isn't it hard to window-shop from inside the store?<eos> - We know you're still broke.<eos> - Not anymore, gingersmurf.<eos> My advice to losers like you has made me Twitter famous.
Fat fairy!<eos> - Ow ow ow! - She's on my foot!<eos> She's on my foot!<eos> Ahh! Someone call security!<eos> Come on, you two. Come on with this!
! Wh...<eos> But what... what will you wear?<eos> Well... well, what about your mother?<eos> She won't be here.<eos> Well, I have all of you.
She is a woman who has thrown away the shackles of her class and devoted herself to the plight of the working men and women throughout this island.<eos> I ask you to welcome Constance Markievicz.<eos> I take it as a GREAT compliment to appear here before you, the BOLD working people of Belfast.<eos> But it is to the women I address myself most, for it is you who stand at the front of any revolution.<eos> You who bear the brunt of oppression.
I have community service.<eos> They gave me additional hours for... Um... fighting with Spencer.<eos> Are you still picking up trash?<eos> Phone calls. It's a community crisis hotline, and today is my first day.<eos> Well, you girls seem to have a lot of experience with crises.
Caleb's probably never even had a birthday party before.<eos> And if we do this, it would mean a lot to him.<eos> You'll find a contract in the back of the packet.<eos> Every volunteer must sign it.<eos> This protects you and the caller.
We thought that Olivia took you.<eos> Olivia? No.<eos> I just didn't want to be with my mom.<eos> Can't she go back to Miami by herself, please?<eos> Juliet, what's going on with you guys?
Well, before we start, I'd like to welcome Jackie Clarke again.<eos> She's leaving later today, but asked to attend our steering committee meeting.<eos> Thank you, Claudia Joy.<eos> Our, uh, major agenda item today is the hurricane relief fund-raiser.<eos> You have a list of proposals in front of you.
You're on her team?<eos> We bonded over your monster feet and justice for women.<eos> A'ight. First of all, girls throw like chicks.<eos> You know, sometimes y'all ruin our games.<eos> You know, you gals take everything so personally and get all emotional.
- My God!<eos> - That's why we came back.<eos> - Oh, no!<eos> The air in the Pyrenees didn't agree with her.<eos> You two look wonderful.
Caucasian, brown hair, blue eyes, hanging by the water.<eos> Thank you, ma'am. Can you hold?<eos> This is a tour change.<eos> The precincts are back logged, and all units are assigned.<eos> I want you two to walk up to riverside park, and when you come back, I'll assign you to station house security.
We found him in riverside park.<eos> He was looking for you, wasn't he?<eos> I wasn't using when he was born.<eos> It was a tough delivery, and they gave me painkillers afterwards.<eos> I know it's hard for women like you to imagine being so weak.
If you don't believe me, ask Pauline Pfeiffer.<eos> I was his second wife.<eos> There were two more after me.<eos> Tortured writers make horrible husbands.<eos> At least you chose to be with him.
Don't give me this "friends" nonsense.<eos> All I ever was to you was the organizer, the problem solver, a leader when you needed one, which is exactly what I was that horrible night when we buried your stepfather.<eos> And I was so grateful for that.<eos> Liar!<eos> All of you, liars!
Maybe he didn't see the guy who hit him.<eos> Yeah, maybe he didn't.<eos> I mean, for all we know, it could've been a girl.<eos> Who's that?<eos> Thought you girls were supposed to wear white.
Because we let Ali treat you like that?<eos> I am so over Ali.<eos> I told you.<eos> She was never my friend, but Hanna was.<eos> And you bitches took her from me.
Hey, dad, do you remember Matt Gunn?<eos> Isn't he the fellow who killed all those prostitutes in Seattle?<eos> No. God. Dad, he dated Sloane for like 2 years.<eos> Hmm. I got a little confession to make.<eos> I wasn't all that interested in what you kids were doing.
They get how important you are to me. ‚ô™ Hey you, it's war<eos> So where's Otis?<eos> Tucked away in a safe place.<eos> Why?<eos> You Barbies never get it.
Are you crazy?<eos> Let's just say, I "persuaded" one of them into telling me where they hid Otis.<eos> We need to strike now.<eos> Let's go.<eos> - You two go.
Screw it, I'm goin' in.<eos> There are stalls in there, right?<eos> Well, I'm sure I don't know.<eos> Well, I don't care.<eos> You two look ridiculous.
I'd have offered you one, but... well, you know.<eos> What? I didn't feel like it.<eos> Hi, you guys!<eos> Oh, isn't this incredible?<eos> The two of you living here, saving a species.
I, Amanda Elaine Baxter, believe we should end the exploitation of animals, thus creating a more ecological and humane planet, and perhaps I am paraphrasing Olivia Wilde...<eos> But so what?<eos> And maybe you should ask yourselves why it's so important to tear me down.<eos> Is it because...<eos> You don't believe in anything?
Get him involved right now, just as a precaution.<eos> Maybe this goes away.<eos> Just in case it doesn't.<eos> Chief...<eos> You two stick together.
I can't believe you're accusing me of something like that.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Did you, though?<eos> No, of course I didn't.<eos> You two, follow me.
You need to make Mona talk.<eos> Spencer's right.<eos> Mona has never been working alone, and she's probably still giving people orders.<eos> Find out who else has seen her.<eos> You guys just ripped me a new one last week for visiting her.
So why is it in your locker?<eos> You've been hiding it this whole time?<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> It's just that you guys...
And I think you're fighting the wrong enemy.<eos> Nothing with people finding a little comfort, especially these days.<eos> No doubt this war has been a lot of fun for you.<eos> I've met some girls, but not as many as you'd think.<eos> You ladies sure pack a punch.
Whoa. Punches?<eos> They assaulted you?<eos> They wish.<eos> We laid them out.<eos> You -- you laid thout?
Go away now.<eos> We're busy.<eos> Okay fine, but I'm taking the nuts.<eos> These nuts.<eos> You two can stay where you are.
Hi, George. How was France?<eos> Do you want to go back to bed with me?<eos> We could just go back to the way things were.<eos> If you hadn't told Kathleen that I'm gay and she hadn't told the entire world!<eos> Don't you two have some sort of agreement to be just with each other?
First they have all the fun and they back out when it is time to shoulder the responsibility.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay. Do only we men have all the fun?<eos> - Yes.<eos> You women also have just as much fun.
For who?<eos> If I knew that, then I wouldn't have to hide.<eos> You have to do this for me!<eos> I mean, you owe it to me, right?<eos> All of you.
I'm pregnant.<eos> - On purpose'?<eos> - What do you think?<eos> I have to tell you something. You, too.<eos> You guys are so beautiful.
It's just until we find a good time to make that switch with Emma.<eos> Mads.<eos> Hey.<eos> There's, uh, extra blankets in the other room.<eos> Well, you two catch up.
George DiCaprio.<eos> I'll make it work.<eos> Out of curiosity, when Grayson called, did he sound sad?<eos> Older guys are the best!<eos> Are you three real?
Maybe we should go mingle.<eos> There's plenty of time for that.<eos> It's so nice to meet your friends.<eos> She's real tight-lipped about work.<eos> I bet you two have a lot of fun.
Previously on Army Wives...<eos> You people don't work.
Previously on Army Wives...<eos> You people don't work.<eos> You don't help. You-- All you do is complain!
Previously on Army Wives...<eos> You're in complete kidney failure.<eos> You people don't work.
(Woman) Yeah, they'd say we poisoned them or something.<eos> Wait.<eos> Don't go.<eos> Please just forget 'em.<eos> You two suck, you know that?
Candy from Korea.<eos> We're packing school supplies, Min-Ji, not candy.<eos> Wait.<eos> Don't go.<eos> You two suck, you know that?
- When we talk.<eos> - When do we talk?<eos> - We're talking now.<eos> - But that's 'cause she didn't understand about the troll.<eos> You know, sometimes when you're going out, the two of you, it's nice to have another person along to keep an eye on your bag if you get up to dance or to watch the bathroom door in case you need to use the men's room?
- But three in reality and number.<eos> - I was thinking if you needed a third... - We don't.<eos> - ... I could come along...<eos> - Two is fine.<eos> ...and watch the men's room door for you.
An old-school, circa 2005 level mean girl.<eos> And those are the worst kind.<eos> You need to step up your game if you plan on beating Miss Clark.<eos> Girls, I'm not trying to beat anyone.<eos> And I really don't think it's appropriate that you...
I wanted to believe I was more evolved, but it turns I'm no better than an alley cat in heat.<eos> Well, the important thing is I was right. Mmm. And the other important thing is--<eos> No, that's it.<eos> I was right.<eos> Will you two stop babbling?
She's on the list for this evening's rounds, Sister.<eos> Oh. And shall I tell you what else is on this evening's rounds?<eos> 21 injections, 16 insulin, four penicillin, an ear to syringe, a cannula to drain and three sets of haemorrhoids to compress!<eos> I'm sorry, Sister, but the problem was... No, no, I'll tell you what the problem is!<eos> You young girls do too much book learning.
I threw in the towel.<eos> I'm like, "okay."<eos> And now I'm, like, stuck in the vagina.<eos> Now I'm like, "I see nothing else except for Whitney's vagina."<eos> You guys never see anything but each other's vagina.
Safija, Safija, what happened to you, my dear child?<eos> Children, what's the matter with you?<eos> Have you gone mad? - Zdravka started it.<eos> It's not me, Dragana started it.<eos> - You two do your homework, is that clear?
I'm just saying. "Fuck me.<eos> Put your finger in my ass."<eos> Ssh! Just shush.<eos> "I like..." Shush!<eos> "If you..." Ah! Look at you two!
You're not prisoners here, you're guests.<eos> But if you wanna leave, as I said, you're free to do so.<eos> But we don't open the gates past dusk.<eos> Draws too much attention.<eos> And you especially, you need a solid night's sleep.
When I left New York, I definitely left a girl behind, which was hard for me, because it's sort of that question of, should I be doing this?<eos> Should I not be doing this?<eos> But at the same time, it's just, for me it was that I'm not gonna stay in a city because of a person.<eos> It was a hard decision, but I think I made the right move.<eos> Are you guys gonna talk?
- I love all these people.<eos> Yay.<eos> How is everyone doing tonight?<eos> I will be your energy master, if you will, your healer, and your creative visual teacher.<eos> What I'm gonna have all of you do is just close your eyes for about 30 seconds. And I really want you to focus on something that you want in your life, something positive, from a job, a relationship, the courage to, you know, grab on to a new venture, and I want you to just kinda keep it to yourself for a little while.
Courtney, where was this bar you two were hanging out in?<eos> A Dive.<eos> I always go there when the ships are in.<eos> Talked Gina into coming with me.<eos> Hey, did any hispanic sailors talk to the two of you?
And you saw what happened.<eos> I know I'm not the easiest...<eos> Person to get along with.<eos> But you helped me anyway.<eos> Especially you two.
Hey, Miss Shaw.<eos> Hey, Jane.<eos> Just thought I'd pop by on my way to work.<eos> I promised Ben I'd stop in every now and then.<eos> Looks like you girls are having fun.
Laura and Kiyomi are sitting right next to Lauren, and they're totally engaged.<eos> And I'm like, "hey, guys", I'm... I'm here, you know."<eos> And once Lauren went to go to the bathroom, it was kind of like, "who's gonna get Lauren?" You know?<eos> And it was quite entertaining for me because I was like, "well, I wonder who's gonna end up with her."<eos> - So both of you...
If you want to fuck the girl, go ahead.<eos> No, no, I think she...<eos> I think she probably likes you more than me.<eos> Kiyomi, I think... I think you guys are gonna hook up.<eos> - Oh, my God. - I'm calling it right now that you guys are gonna hook up.
I'm Cece.<eos> Spencer.<eos> Melissa hasting's little sister.<eos> Ali talked about you.<eos> She talked about all of you.
Jenna will love it.<eos> She has a highly developed sense of smell.<eos> Come on, Emily.<eos> I need your help.<eos> You guys are good friends.
Industrial supplies.<eos> Ooh, clever.<eos> Sister lolli,<eos> Thank you for the most wonderful afternoon!<eos> Oh, and you are coming to our woman's bible class,
She's acting like everything's fine.<eos> Because I am fine.<eos> There she is!<eos> Hey, you.<eos> You guys, please stop looking at me like somebody kicked my puppy.
Did Yoast take the job yet?<eos> What happened to the movie?<eos> Am I missing something here?<eos> All right, you know what?<eos> I am utterly baffled by all of you.
We all do.<eos> You can't bully us into being good.<eos> You need to believe in us to be great.<eos> Believe in you?<eos> You girls...
I'm trying to build that trust.<eos> Look, if you asked my wife, she'd tell you I'm not the most expressive guy on the planet.<eos> Yes, I can definitely confirm that.<eos> Thanks.<eos> But I understand that you girls are professional athletes at the most clutch time in your life.
- Okay.<eos> - Um, Dan isn't coming.<eos> - To the wedding? - Mm-hmm.<eos> I'm not surprised.<eos> I mean, he's told me that you guys doing this for the show is fine, but he wants no part of it, and...
The way you...<eos> Tuck your hair...<eos> Behind your ear...<eos> I couldn't stop thinking about that...<eos> About the two of you...
Do you want red wine too?<eos> - Yes.<eos> And are you two together?<eos> Yes.<eos> You guys too, right?
"I just told her"?<eos> Isn't it true?<eos> Four years.<eos> - Four years already.<eos> And you two?
Sweet.<eos> - Sweet?<eos> What's your girlfriend then?<eos> My girlfriend...<eos> And you two?
A nice pike-perch.<eos> - A really nice one.<eos> For dinner.<eos> And then we ate it together.<eos> And you two?
- You know all about that.<eos> - Oh, I sure do.<eos> Elijah, it's so good to see you.<eos> It really is.<eos> You two are cut from the same cloth, aren't you?
Who else would know Chen's a copycat?<eos> The letter goes on with three pages of details about these crimes.<eos> Details that only the rapist would know.<eos> The letter concludes with this chilling threat:<eos> "You Soho sluts think you're special.
She was newly brunette, completely alone, and no one seemed to care but me.<eos> The whole thing was more unnatural than Mr. Wolfe's new colored contact lenses.<eos> Amethyst is my birthstone.<eos> Cool. (Dance music playing)<eos> (Amplified voice) If you don't want it, who wants it?
The whole thing was more unnatural than Mr. Wolfe's new colored contact lenses.<eos> Amethyst is my birthstone.<eos> Cool. (Dance music playing)<eos> (Amplified voice) If you don't want it, who wants it?<eos> I can't want it for you!
- He was only there to protect me.<eos> If that's what you think, you are naive... or ignorant...<eos> or I don't know what.<eos> Well, at least I don't play judge and jury and kill people.<eos> You guys will make up.
And then she resigned in shame.<eos> Okay.<eos> Bring it in.<eos> Dread menace, looking at you for some leadership.<eos> You two, Shay-la-vie.
Enterprise upgraded me to a sebring.<eos> Shotgun!<eos> Mom, you coming?<eos> Nah, I'm gonna hang back with Andy.<eos> You guys go.
Keep the change.<eos> What are you doing, Sophie?<eos> You don't pay for the cupcakes.<eos> No, take it for your business.<eos> Ever since your big party planner meeting went bust, I was worried that you two girls might form a joint suicide pact.
Where did han go?<eos> He said he might have a plan.<eos> Oh, my lord and Taylor!<eos> That little mother can ride.<eos> You two look like two princesses in a fairy tale.
- Uh, thank God!<eos> I've been trying to get rid of him for an hour.<eos> I think I've hit her last nerve.<eos> My job here is done.<eos> You two take care of my favorite Barbie, OK?
- That's not fair!<eos> - No, Lauren didn't sneak out.<eos> It was just me.<eos> Please don't blame her for this.<eos> You two are teammates.
What else has Matthew decided for my family?<eos> Robert?<eos> Don't worry, I don't need to be fed.<eos> We're going.<eos> All of you.
- I like it.<eos> It's the sound of Ray Keegan going to jail.<eos> I'm here. What is so important, it couldn't wait?<eos> You've gotta be kidding me. Flowers?<eos> Yeah. I saw on TV that you Barbies are always getting handed flowers when you're up on the medal stand.
Well, let's...<eos> Let's go to your place and find out.<eos> You look worried.<eos> We're running out of suspects in our circle.<eos> You two are clear, and you think there's a good chance I could be the skinwalker?
- Audrey is missing?<eos> I swear I didn't do anything to her.<eos> I'm gonna ask you one more time.<eos> Where is the Colorado kid?<eos> You two are the same person?
Go away!<eos> No way I'm signing a prenup.<eos> You know what?<eos> Just get out of my head!<eos> All of you, just leave me alone!
Yeah, just a little one.<eos> She left a note because she's a good girl.<eos> I'm a guilt-ridden girl.<eos> Would this be a good time for me to take my mom to her extremely important ct scan?<eos> 'Cause I could always come back if you two need some more time to chitchat.
I should probably go back.<eos> Check and see if Matt Porter called, all right?<eos> Okay,<eos> I'm not crazy.<eos> You guys saw that, right?
Bryan, Willow Smith just rsvp'd.<eos> It's gonna be a no.<eos> Well, this is the worst day ever.<eos> Okay.<eos> I have personally hand-picked each and every one of you girls because I've seen the Romney sticker on your parents' car.
Hello, ladies and gentlemen!<eos> Come on, my people!<eos> We are your new DJs.<eos> We're about to rock this party right off!<eos> Thank you, DJ Ken, and we're going to play you a sick tune that's going to make all you bros and all you teenage hos just lose your shit on the floor.
I didn't realize you were an undergrad women's studies major experimenting with lesbianism right now.<eos> And I didn't realize you were mamie eisenhower.<eos> [ Laughing ] First of all...<eos> Kadooze on the mamie eisenhower reference.<eos> And second of all, I will tell you what all you modern hipster chicks are afraid to admit and what nobody but your grandmother or your gay best friend will tell you...
I'm the star.<eos> I am the star.<eos> - That's cute.<eos> - That's really nice.<eos> Okay, you two, I'm gonna flick this switch, and then you'll be on the air, talking to millions of Americans.
What about Dylan, huh?<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> The women are doing all the work.<eos> As usual.<eos> Well, you're obviously pulling a different dinosaur through the woods, 'cause I'm the only one pulling this one.
Kove, will you be my mom?<eos> Please be my mom, Kove!<eos> Say you'll be my mom!<eos> Oh, yeah, I'm your mom!<eos> Yeah! Whoo! Which one of you drunks is Piper Ferguson?
You're a lifesaver.<eos> Yeah, thank you.<eos> This is way more interesting than the programming I usually do.<eos> It's very James Bond.<eos> If we get attacked by double agents, I'm expecting you girls to protect me.
Well, I guess I know where I'm going, hmm?<eos> Happy birthday, Cassandra.<eos> Uh, you, too.<eos> She's kidding, right?<eos> You guys don't really share a birthday.
- in the study. - Ooh.<eos> In case I just happen to wander in and take a peek?<eos> Which I will, because I plan to spend every second I have left here with you. Hmm.<eos> Okay, day six of Wade avoiding sex with me... discuss.<eos> Look how late I am for something. Hey, maybe you two can talk about it, huh?
A boy, a girl?<eos> I think we're gonna let gender be a surprise.<eos> As long as he or she is healthy and willing to go to Laker games with me.<eos> So, with our baby coming, we have been talking more and more about spirituality it got us thinking about your commitment ceremony in Ojai, and how incredibly moving it was.<eos> And you're one of the few couples we know with a true spiritual conviction.
Hmm, it's mostly me complimenting her.<eos> No, no, no, no, I mean "complementing,"<eos> like with an "e." With an "e""<eos> it's... uh, you know what?<eos> You fit together, okay?
I'm just afraid of scuffing them on the dance floor.<eos> Oh, just seal them with nail polish.<eos> I do it to all of my shoes.<eos> But you know what, Brooke, you're the bride, what do you think?<eos> If you guys don't mind...
No, no, no, no!<eos> He's gonna hump!<eos> Virginia, cover your ears!<eos> If your daughter was a squirrel, you would never have done that. (girl screams) (glass shatters)<eos> ! All right, you two, hold her down.
Thanks.<eos> This was not just my fault.<eos> It sure as hell wasn't mine.<eos> You could have killed her.<eos> I understand competition and drive, but you two, You need to figure out how to work together, and you better do it fast.
And you think you might be that "stuff."<eos> Maybe.<eos> And at least "maybe" keeps me in the game.<eos> You know, that's sort of a nice theme for my piece.<eos> That you guys came to Cleveland for what may be.
All right, ladies, come here.<eos> Here's what we're gonna do.<eos> All right, uh, Lily and Sara, firewood.<eos> Zoe and Caitlyn, water source.<eos> The rest of you, campsite cleanup, go.
They kept crying yesterday.<eos> That's nonsense.<eos> We should do something for them.<eos> to bring back some serenity.<eos> Can I count on you to help me with that?
But why kill him that way?<eos> I mean, why make it look like a suicide? Cover up the murder.<eos> The murder, or something bigger involving explosives?<eos> We gotta find that workshop.<eos> You are the picture of a civilized evening at home.
Hey.<eos> Oh! What...?<eos> Come on.<eos> What are you guys doing here? Uh? Well, uh, there seemed to be a mix-up, and we found ourselves with a prepaid male stripper on our hands.<eos> We were wondering if maybe you would want...
They're busy making the messes... And throwing their toys on the floor like babies, and we've got to clean it up.<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> That's why... I'm starting a women's activist group at Abaddonn.<eos> You know, just so that we can, like, get at it, together, you know?<eos> So, I hope and know you guys'll join in on this, and like...
Here's your press schedule and VIP passes.<eos> I'm sorry, but this is the team I've been told to showcase.<eos> If you just hang on, my boss wants to meet you.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Why on earth would they showcase you over us?
I like it. ‚ô™ When I fall out, who will leave me? ‚ô™<eos> ‚ô™ Will my voice still carry meaning? ‚ô™ Hey.<eos> So, what did you think?<eos> We thought you did amazing.<eos> So did you. ‚ô™ Will the world still see in color? ‚ô™
Oh, come on, what can one little drink hurt? Um, uh... Yeah...<eos> Look, she doesn't care if you have a girlfriend.<eos> Neither do I.<eos> Can you handle two?<eos> What, the both of you?
- Love!<eos> Excuse me, since when are you the team captain?<eos> Since, with Kaylie out, I'm number one at The Rock.<eos> - Says who?<eos> - I'm ranked higher than both of you on the World Team.
Sorry that you can't handle boys and I can.<eos> Oh, by handle, you mean prance around in your underwear?<eos> Just stop.<eos> You know, on my last rotation, I knew you were fake-cheering for me, but it felt good, anyway.<eos> I used to watch you guys cheer each other on and I was jealous.
Over this.<eos> Oh, we're not fighting.<eos> - No, we're sparring.<eos> - With nothing. But good intentions.<eos> Oh, perhaps, but before I help you, I need to know that the two of you. Are gonna work together.
No.<eos> It's just something Hetty's getting rid of.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah, but you have to be careful, be...<eos> You two scare me.
Hi.<eos> So what are we gonna do while I'm here?<eos> I hear the bars stay open till, like, 4:00 a.M.<eos> They do, but we're gonna need our sleep Because I have a very ambitious Museum schedule planned for tomorrow.<eos> And then maybe you two can do something a little more... Fun.
I feel like you've had it out for me since day one.<eos> And maybe it was something I said, or, I don't know, maybe you're just one of those women<eos> - who doesn't like other women.<eos> - That is not true.<eos> You ladies want to play a little pool?
Great, so we think the whistle-blower was an ASA?<eos> That's the thinking.<eos> I was going to go check.<eos> No, I'll take that.<eos> You two go question the daughter.
Just overcome it!<eos> From now on<eos> I'm relying on you.<eos> Madam, the general is here.<eos> Both of you, get out!
This part of town, you couldn't get a witness to an earthquake.<eos> That's the first good news of the day.<eos> He's worried about the press blowing this up.<eos> Rose's design studio is around the corner.<eos> You two start there.
Three of you are going to have to do... last-chance performances for Ryan... to convince him to put you on the callback list.<eos> Mckynleigh...<eos> Hannah...<eos> Marissa...<eos> You three all have some work to do.
Wait!<eos> People!<eos> Do you think you can just ignore me? !<eos> Well, as far as accidental death goes, this one was pretty tasty.<eos> I feel tingly. Do you feel tingly?
And, again, this isn't about Amy, okay?<eos> This is about me, all right?<eos> Those girls were mean to me, and they always thought they were better than me.<eos> Okay, well, I don't know anything about those girls, but I do know something about Amy.<eos> And after everything you guys have been through, after all the competition between you two, she was still willing to be your friend and throw you a baby shower.
Of course I am.<eos> I'm Naomi Clark.<eos> And I have better things to do than just...<eos> cry about little boys.<eos> Can one of you help me with the rest of this sushi so that I can dump it in the neighbor's pool?
Wonder if she invited Chuck.<eos> If he's anywhere that fedex can reach...<eos> Hi. I don't believe we've met.<eos> I'm Nate Archibald.<eos> And, uh, you are?
That's what I'll call her on Leno.<eos> Bobby-- what are you doing here?<eos> I'm your husband.<eos> I'm not going anywhere.<eos> Hey, you two, how many lesbians does it take to make me a sandwich?
It's a really big step.<eos> And we're really gonna miss you.<eos> Oh, I'm sure you will.<eos> And now I'd better go...<eos> Before you three start crying.
And the next stop on our tour of departed souls-- the gem of mid-town, Murder House.<eos> Relax.<eos> I'm not here to bust you.<eos> Why not?<eos> Because what you guys went through last week can haunt you a long time.
Exactly.<eos> Anyway, I think he's pulled, not that I even care.<eos> Course he has.<eos> First night's a freebie.<eos> Are you girls banging tonight? Er? I dunno?
So what are the funeral crasher rules?<eos> Number one, if you think you're gonna get caught, just say you're overcome with emotion, and walk away.<eos> Number two, when coming up with a cover story, specific details make lies more believable.<eos> Number three, pick an alias that's close to your real name so it'll be easy to remember.<eos> For you neophytes, maybe, but I am a trained actress.
I'm starting over.<eos> Max, why'd you do that?<eos> It was good.<eos> Not good enough.<eos> You two not done yet?
Now less talky-talky, more hanging up the things I threw on the floor.<eos> Okay, Mandy, you've got a lot of attitude for somebody who is one of 10,000 applicants to a Colorado modeling competition.<eos> Whoa. Whoa. I cannot work in this judgy environment, okay?<eos> I have a dream.<eos> You two can either be near it or not.
Children whose fathers water the same patch of grass for 45 minutes, waiting for you to come and pick up your mail.<eos> It's the only part of my lawn that's green.<eos> Excuse me, but I don't think Joy meant--<eos> - No, it's not just her!<eos> It's all of you!
And we'll all talk you up.<eos> And you can turn on your unique Elka charm.<eos> I am damn loveable.<eos> And I'll invite Chad so that you can all experience his hands.<eos> And I'll invite Lou, and you guys can help me figure out how old he is.
They're just kidding. "You're fired, you're fired."<eos> Everybody's fired!<eos> What?<eos> Come on, nobody is firing anybody here.<eos> You both love each other, even though there's a lot of meowing in the cathouse, which is totally sexist, I know.
- Me, too!<eos> - Me, too!<eos> - We'll shave as well!<eos> I'm an honorary daughter of Taijun, so it's my obligation to shoulder the risks with the Yangs.<eos> But you need not risk your lives.
Be careful of the fireballs!<eos> - This way!<eos> - This way!<eos> Protect Taijun!<eos> You, follow me!
Guiying!<eos> Do you have an escape plan?<eos> - Build a bridge.<eos> - Build a bridge?<eos> You two, take off your chain mail.
Liuniang!<eos> Taijun is all right!<eos> Taijun! Taijun!<eos> Please forgive us for not protecting you.<eos> It's OK so long as you're fine.
You eat.<eos> You go home.<eos> And why is she any different than Phillip at your office?<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> - You know, you guys go shopping together.
Dag, you're trying to sneak out, the morning after we've had sex.<eos> I'm not mad.<eos> I'm just done with that part of my life.<eos> I guess I feel a little left out here.<eos> With the two of you...
How much should we penalize the person who gets caught?<eos> Just make it $1.<eos> Then it's no fun, it's like child's play.<eos> If I get caught, I'll pay $10.<eos> You girls can pay $1.

He has built a bulletproof glass ceiling?<eos> It's more than a theory. all the data points to the fact That he's been sexually discriminating Against his female employees for years.<eos> And reynolds is so powerful in the fashion community That none of these women want to step forward. They're afraid of being blackballed.<eos> So, what are we gonna do?<eos> You're not gonna do anything.

Congratulations.<eos> Thank you.<eos> For what?<eos> See, that's why dating is easier for women.<eos> You guys know what you're getting.
No, it is so much harder to be a single woman.<eos> So much harder. You guys read "cathy"?<eos> Look, when it comes to sex, women are the gatekeepers.<eos> That's why it's easier for you.<eos> You get to decide when and if it's happening.
I mean, why would it be?<eos> Oh, God, I'm sounding pretty ridiculous! You're fine.<eos> Well, apparently, I am inspiration for looking for love in all the wrong places.<eos> Well, it looks like this was a bust for me,<eos> - but, um, you two... - Wave.
Oh, happy place.<eos> Oh my God!<eos> Alright, OK.<eos> Now that you have completely taken my breath away, we're gonna sit down, and you're gonna tell me everything.<eos> Yeah, you two walk off into the sunset, no dead bodies strewn behind...
All right. lets do some long distance running.<eos> It's to challenge your limits.<eos> It's going to get hard if you run too fast.<eos> Why the heck are we doing long distance running? why are we being forced to run until we can't run any more?<eos> You there!
Ok, ned.<eos> Stop.<eos> I know this is what you're into, And I know you're studying the occult because you're trying to help people--<eos> I'm studying it because I find it fascinating.<eos> Because both of you Showed me there's more in this world than what you can see.
What's dysfunctional is asking someone to be your maid of honor, and then sneaking off without them.<eos> I didn't ask you!<eos> That's another thing that you wormed your way into.<eos> You know, I wanted Lux to be my maid of honor, not you.<eos> So you guys grew up together... you and Tasha?
I'm like Florence Nightingale.<eos> You know, you could make your life a whole lot easier if you would just admit that you need people.<eos> You don't have to be such a lone wolf, Cal.<eos> Aw, do me a favor.<eos> With you two and Foster and the rest of the group, it's a 3-ring bloody circus.
I don't think I'd be comfortable with that.<eos> And your parental skills are so stellar?<eos> Have you met your son?<eos> It's abundantly clear that Ellen and I are the only people in this room qualified to parent anyone.<eos> You two are whack jobs.
On "Make it Or Break it"...<eos> I'm not responsible for the National Committee, She was marti Over Shasa.<eos> Which maybe I could live with if you... hadn't had an affair with him!<eos> You girls will not be going to London.
What's that supposed to mean?<eos> Kaylie threw a hissy fit and stomped out of practice,<eos> Emily just flubbed a remedial vault.<eos> So that just leaves you.<eos> Although, it's a wonder how any of you... can focus at all in spite of your mothers.
- He's not my boyfriend.<eos> - Oh. I thought at Nationals...<eos> Yeah, well, a lot's happened since then.<eos> Kaylie told me what's going on with the National Team.<eos> You guys were robbed.
Well, I'm going to a movie at 5: 00 with steve, And mom already gave me permission.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - All right, you know what?<eos> It's fine, we still have an hour For braverman family bonding.<eos> You guys mount up, I'm gonna go get the boy.
Hey.<eos> - Hi, Annie.<eos> - Hi. Dana.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> You-you two know each other?
Okay.<eos> (indistinct conversations)<eos> Good morning.<eos> Happy mother's day.<eos> (sighs) I'm so glad So many of you could join us. Mother's day is always a special day.
Morning.<eos> I talk to you later, Grace.<eos> Let's talk.<eos> We're not leaving.<eos> If you two wanna talk, you leave.
And if there are tears, she's there.<eos> Well, that's right.<eos> Just this morning, Kathy was in my office crying.<eos> And I just rocked her and gave her some makeup tips.<eos> Aw. Sounds like you guys have a great time at work.
Charmaine never graduated from anything.<eos> And we don't have a brother.<eos> From my first marriage.<eos> But he wasn't well.<eos> You aren't well.
But girls, wait.<eos> I'm not even tied yet.<eos> You're gonna tie me up, remember?<eos> We've had enough of you, freak!<eos> Okay, well, I had sex with all of you.
From, uh...<eos> From whoever killed Ryan.<eos> Oh, people tangled up in drug-mule stuff Like Ryan seems to have been...<eos> Those people... They always get what they have coming to them.<eos> You two, on the other hand, should be just fine.
Would you go easy on me If you knew I smuggled something off the plane?<eos> Buzz.<eos> Tiny wine, anybody?<eos> It goes great with take-out.<eos> None for me, but you go ahead.
Someone should check.<eos> We will, believe me.<eos> Uh, there's just one more thing I want to know.<eos> And I want an honest answer.<eos> Did the two of you agree to go out with me and Flynn Because you thought we could keep you safe Till you got rid of the drugs and left town?
Thank you, lieutenant.<eos> Arrest them, refresh their memories about their rights, And get them down here as quickly as possible.<eos> You got it, chief.<eos> See you in about 20 minutes.<eos> All right, you two, I want you to get your stuff.
I have tried to talk to her.<eos> I -- she won't talk to me.<eos> You know that.<eos> That's because you get so weird every time a boy comes near us.<eos> I-I just don't want you girls to --
Well, thank you.<eos> Uh, am I invited?<eos> Uh, no. It's a girls' day out.<eos> I want to spend time with Martha and Alexis.<eos> Uh, but I love massages, and I don't want the three of you conspiring.
He has a different energy now. He's quieter.<eos> But we're getting married.<eos> And are we still in the wedding?<eos> Of course.<eos> The bridesmaids are you guys, Andy roddick's wife, My dutch cousins, And Penelope cruz's hotter sister Monica.
And are we still in the wedding?<eos> Of course.<eos> The bridesmaids are you guys, Andy roddick's wife, My dutch cousins, And Penelope cruz's hotter sister Monica.<eos> You're gonna be so out of place, Liz.<eos> Anyway, my mom said that if you guys Are gonna throw me a work party, It has to be this week.
We are not best friends, okay?<eos> You're my mother.<eos> And that sucks for me.<eos> So, I just wanted to say I am so excited to be here with my best friends in the world.<eos> You guys have been amazing and supportive, and I'm just so glad that you all get to be a part of my journey.
What brings you back to the homestead?<eos> Don't tell me word reached you that Rufus is making his famous chili.<eos> Jenny's in town.<eos> Hmm. Guess she forgot to call.<eos> Well, I know you two haven't exactly been the best of friends in the past, but maybe that can change now that you've had some time apart.
Well, unless it's a murder-suicide, I think I'll pass.<eos> So dramatic.<eos> You should be a writer.<eos> Tim Gunn is being honored at "The Observer's" new yorkers of the year party tonight at the boom boom room.<eos> Why don't you two accompany me?
Can't you just make an inspiring Winger speech about trust, throw in a few digs at an easy celebrity target, and put a ribbon on this thing?<eos> Abed, think about this for one second if a single one of us leaves this room before we find that pen, how can any of us trust anyone in this group ever again?<eos> What's your hurry?<eos> I'm clothing myself.<eos> I'm not comfortable standing around in my all-together like you two anorex jeze...
I was thinking about something.<eos> I-I know that, um, Max and Emily have some issues, okay?<eos> And I know that-- that there are things that they need to work out, obviously.<eos> But I had a great idea.<eos> What if you guys, you and Emily, came over for a playdate with Max and I?
I mean, we only have you as long as we're inputting,<eos> But I could ask to make you permanent.<eos> Wouldn't that be fun?<eos> All right, I'm gonna use the computer in the file room.<eos> You guys can use these computers out here.
Just a minute!<eos> We have to cover for Emily.<eos> We?<eos> I didn't tell her to go.<eos> Shouldn't you two be in your own room?
Actually, yeah.<eos> I was wondering if Emily had heard anything from Toby Cavanaugh since he went missing.<eos> Do I look like Emily?<eos> Ask her.<eos> I thought you girls shared everything.
Okay, thank you.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Michela?<eos> Ah... You're looking to party?<eos> You girls should get T-shirts made up - I've got milk, looking to party?
Ohh!<eos> Carnations. My favorite.<eos> Oh, Burt! Ha ha!<eos> You shouldn't have.<eos> Well, you two, you just sit and get to know each other.
And he thought I married the wrong girl.<eos> Okay.<eos> Bye.<eos> All right, j.J. Let's do this.<eos> Okay, you two. Let's go get grandpa.
Where are my red patent pumps?<eos> We're going to a cemetery.<eos> You're supposed to show your respect, not your secret garden.<eos> We can't all be "Miss oldest virgin in the West".<eos> Hey, you two, show some respect.
Because I have to say, you do look tired, Claire.<eos> Burning the candle at both ends?<eos> But I'm one to talk.<eos> I'm lucky if I get four hours some nights.<eos> But then again, you two don't have to worry about that because you both have such wonderful husbands.
Barbara!<eos> And I see you've met Christian.<eos> Uh, you know each other?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> And you two know each other?
Are you moving out?<eos> I would never do that to you or your brother.<eos> Alison told me how you even threatened Toby if he told the truth.<eos> She said she was afraid of you.<eos> Is that why one of you did what you did?
Luke's her son.<eos> The way Sarah Jane looks at Luke...<eos> Well, it's the same way I look at you.<eos> A mother knows.<eos> I see you two, having a laugh, sharing your big secret.
Thank you!<eos> Appreciate your support!<eos> Oh, hi!<eos> I hope this is Stamie.<eos> You guys make such a nice couple, 'cause you guys are both good-looking.
My God.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> What's not to like?<eos> Really?<eos> You girls are glamorama.
I was like, "that shit's weird."<eos> It's sad because, you know, Whenever we have now, like, a get-together, you know...<eos> - We can't all get together Because one person's not speaking to the other, And, you know, the family's not as United<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> - But if you guys, in the future, Can, you know, make up, that would be the best thing.
What does it say on your flowers?<eos> So Nick is not gonna take no for an answer, huh?<eos> No.<eos> I've never been in a triangle before.<eos> You girls are slutty, what would you do?
Oh, oh! Look, Stacy made two slices of toast.<eos> I will bet that one of them is for her best friend.<eos> I'm hungry.<eos> Okay, enough!<eos> You two are acting like those girls on "Mad-itude."
I thought we were done.<eos> You know, rejoyla, when you're snarky, something unfortunate happens to your face.<eos> She knows.<eos> I tell her all the time.<eos> So this is where you two are hiding.
Have breakfast with your family.<eos> You'll call me as soon as you make contact?<eos> Yes, I will call you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Okay, the two of you, kiss your mother good-bye. Oh.
Take it.<eos> And if you didn't believe me just a little, you'd have shot me by now.<eos> The Coach.<eos> He can't find us here.<eos> He can't find you in here.
Whoa! Where'd that come from?<eos> Where did that come from?<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> Okay, I'm trying to watch my diet,<eos> I'm trying to exercise, and you two are just trying to make me fatter!
I think if there was an apocalypse. And that guy and his kid crossed my path and I was hungry, I would hunt them down and I would rip them limb from limb.<eos> And then I would take the kid's skull. And I would wear it. So that everybody would think twice before they crossed me.<eos> Then I would take the dad's bones and I would. Design an accessory line that I would sell from a bombed-out Macy's. Because that's what's going to happen to people who try to take what's mine.<eos> When the apocalypse comes I'll be fine.<eos> What about all of you?
We pay dues, too.<eos> But we're the ones that put this gym on the map, and let's face it, no one cares about men's gymnastics.<eos> That was before I came along.<eos> I appreciate women's gymnastics, but men's gymnastics are more challenging.<eos> We do six apparatuses, you only do four.
Yeah.<eos> All right.<eos> Good.<eos> I-I gotta call tech support.<eos> You girls had so many hits, it fried my router.
That is so thoughtful.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Ohh! Okay.<eos> I've gotta give Celia a bath.<eos> You two go easy on the candy.
[cheers and applause] David hasselhoff, george hamilton, hulk hogan--<eos> I think if we've learned anything from tonight, It's that self-tanner causes you to fail In the entertainment business.<eos> Look at all these idiots you've attracted.<eos> Lisa lampanelli, pam anderson--<eos> You two women Are like the sisterhood of the traveling cunts! [laughter]
Okay, I didn't bring them.<eos> Just... just calm down.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Our sister's dead because of you.<eos> And you took part, so you both pay.
Carter told me he loved me.<eos> He tells me all the time.<eos> You know what?<eos> I don't give a damn what either of you two do.<eos> If you guys want to screw up your careers by messing around with boys, then go ahead.
- Like it never happened.<eos> - Thatta girl.<eos> - Hey, you get the day off tomorrow?<eos> - Unfortunately, no.<eos> While you guys are taking the next step towards the World Team,
Find the best specimen you can and try to hang on to him.<eos> Don't let anyone else near.<eos> Nothing we can do about it.<eos> Makes us defensive.<eos> You four manage, though. Mmm.
Just...<eos> Girls.<eos> I got a treat for you.<eos> Come here. Come here. Come here.<eos> Uh, you... you're sitting in a bar with a celebrity.
Okay, ladies, here's how we're gonna do this.<eos> I'll be flying.<eos> You two are catching.
You're really starting to tug at my heartstrings, kid.<eos> Sure.<eos> Okay, gotta go.<eos> Kate, Kara, I just can't do this anymore.<eos> You guys were right, okay?
Take a look at yourselves.<eos> You all possess sexy... Lithe, incredibly flexible bodies.<eos> Make you all prime peeping targets.<eos> That's right.<eos> As precious as each and every one of you are, you're just a bucket of nasty chum... to the great white shark that is the ugly male sex drive.
What Julianne is saying is that we have no intention of interfering with River Rock's slate, so all we ask is you pay us the same professional courtesy.<eos> By pulling my offer on "The Purple Door,"<eos> a property I greatly desire.<eos> You don't... "Greatly desire" it.<eos> But you do.
How did you convince them to release me?<eos> A student visa?<eos> We can't afford college.<eos> It turns out that Ms. christie Cavanaugh has created the company's first scholarship.<eos> And you two are its first recipients.
All that extra fabric makes you look bigger than you are, and those cut-off shorts?<eos> Honey, you put the "bear" in unbearable.<eos> Book off the afternoon for a fashion intervention, Jay Manuel style.<eos> Okay.<eos> Jay Manuel: And you two, with the phone calls, the glazed look in your eyes, and the Lady Gaga impersonation, you really expect me to entrust my words - my baby - to them?
How bout a bustier?<eos> How about two band-aids and a cork?<eos> You know what?<eos> I'm just going to finish this up by myself.<eos> Why don't you two go watch TV Or bat a dead mouse around the kitchen floor?
- Hey. Hi<eos> Wow. So you're having a walk.<eos> How are you?<eos> Good.<eos> How are you guys?
You've always been a sucker for cute and smart.<eos> - We wanted to sabotage you.<eos> - We did.<eos> But then when we were trying to explain to her what a jerk you were... We realized it was pretty sweet of you to get us to patch things up.<eos> Does this mean you two are back on track?
Love you.<eos> Bluebird?<eos> Come on, I'm not stupid. Look, I know you're fighting, but what I can't live with is that you're fighting because of me.<eos> - Papi, that's not true.<eos> - Papi, honestly... Now, you both are strong, intelligent, capable women, but you can't do it all.
And Serena and her mother are wonderful, kind people.<eos> Blair...<eos> Do you know what you're doing?<eos> I thought I was leaving high school behind.<eos> I guess you never do.
So where do you live?<eos> Near the park, in the building with the gardens.<eos> - And the street name?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Do you two live around here?
Oh... you guys, please, please, don't...<eos> You love each other. Just get me out of the equation and everything will go back to the way it is.<eos> Would you please shut the fuck up, please?<eos> Just shut the fuck up!<eos> You... wow, you guys should just, you should give it a try.
My bosses are billing me as the new Leah McLaren.<eos> I promised them something about the reunion.<eos> You know, who was the least likely to succeed, but did.<eos> Who was most likely to succeed, but instead peaked in High School.<eos> How about you guys?
And you won't go out with any other guys.<eos> We'll see.<eos> Come on, Grace, I can't wait weeks.<eos> Talk to your parents today.<eos> You girls aren't supposed to be wandering the hallways.
We got to go. Seal the door as soon as we leave.<eos> - We will.<eos> - You come back, you hear me?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You two, you do exactly what Kim and Molly tell you to do until we get back, ok?
Is everything ok?<eos> I'm fine with it if you are.<eos> I'm fine with it.<eos> Fine with what?<eos> Ok, I hate it when you girls get all spooky twin mind-ready on me.
We must make certain that the others are 200% spotless.<eos> This is a case crying out for female intuition.True, true.<eos> That is the short list.<eos> Names, addresses and vital statistics.<eos> And you two are going to take them to task and report back.
And you two are going to take them to task and report back.<eos> And I will choose the winner.<eos> - You? Don't you have a panel of judges?<eos> A panel that does as I say.<eos> They know something that you two are about to find out - no-one pays like Two Shots Pulani.
I am not picking sides, I'm just... I'm staying neutral, okay?<eos> Like Switzerland.<eos> And I want my daughters speaking to each other.<eos> There we go, that didn't take long.<eos> You know, this fight between you two, it's reached a point where it's destroying the family.
Well, no one's perfect.<eos> Anthony's pretty close.<eos> See, you're wrong about "Mr. Right here."<eos> Judith didn't settle. You didn't settle with Brian.<eos> I mean, you guys have always been madly in love.
Hey, listen. We saw ya out there in the audience.<eos> Yeah, you were getting a little crazy out there.<eos> Let's just get to the blow jobs.<eos> Blow-what? I don't know.<eos> Look, we called you back here because we want to share our love of Christ with you.
Bloody hell.<eos> Get lost, worthless pests.<eos> Romping round the house.<eos> I'm at my wits end dealing with you.<eos> Here I am burdened with work - and you all - get lost.
Yeah, sure, you know what?<eos> Let me just grab another beer and I'll be right back with you.<eos> Don't you flake on me.<eos> Dude, you been working out? Didn't think so.<eos> You two, stay amazing. My God.
And who do you love most? Samuel and Ivan?<eos> Samuel. You see he did not like Ivan?<eos> We can know where you go that idea?<eos> Well then, why you knocking?<eos> You know what happens to girls who are too sticky?
And Elsa ... Do not hesitate, if you want to come back ...<eos> You help us to make new memories Jacinta?<eos> New memories?<eos> When Jacinta was born, people threw the poop out the window?<eos> I feel that you have a problem ... insoluble.
They are much better than old ones.<eos> So you're not angry?<eos> Of course not. You know where are the best memories?<eos> There.<eos> Wherever you are.
I shan't give Peggy permission to attend.<eos> My dear Mrs. Bell, permit the young to be diverted.<eos> If they step beyond their bounds, I shall supply Miss Matty with a stick and send her to suppress them.<eos> Life at Eton rendered William very savage.<eos> You two are not playing like the fair sex should.
- Don't be silly.<eos> You girls need to work on your poker faces.<eos> I've arranged a little something to thank you for all your kindness.<eos> - You didn't have to do that.<eos> - You two will be guests at the Dream Haven spa this weekend.
I'd do what she says.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - I know, right?<eos> Hey.<eos> To you guys and this hot dress... and... calamari.
and that really makes me stick out in palm desert. usually, i'm somewhere between eva longoria and whoopi goldberg.<eos> well, i hope you'll be comfy on the couch.<eos> oh, it's fine.<eos> i'll just ignore my disintegrating disc.<eos> you two seem well-suited as roommates.
Because I love her.<eos> You're famous because you are arrested.<eos> The end of high school means the end of me on "Gossip Girl." Congratulations.<eos> You have a clean slate... until college.<eos> Her dad is marrying Lily Bass, so I think that makes her richer than all of you.
By tomorrow afternoon, we will know<eos> Who has made this year's National Gymnastics Team.<eos> I want you to forget everything that's come before this moment.<eos> Forget everything that is to follow.<eos> You are the few, Who have earned the right to be at this place at this time.
And every guy I ever brought home got turned down just like that.<eos> But come on, he's loaded, goes to Tokyo U, even studied abroad!<eos> Perfect, isn't he?<eos> Really. Almost too good to be true.<eos> You two spinsters should be taking notes!
Can i speak to her? [deep breath] Hi, dr. foster.<eos> What--what am i doing here?<eos> I met jessie today.<eos> Oh.<eos> You two don't get along.
She often came by so we could do homework together.<eos> Then one day she asked me...<eos> "What about us?"<eos> I don't know, I said.<eos> You girls always... ask about things I can't answer.
She looks like Cinderella!<eos> They're as alike as two drops of water.<eos> That stepdaughter of yours always brings us bad luck.<eos> What will happen if anyone discovers I squandered her inheritance?<eos> To dress you up, I reduced her to poverty.
I'm gonna kill you.<eos> I think he's right.<eos> And I think we should talk about it.<eos> That's what I'm talkin' 'bout...<eos> You two talking... 'bout it.
Oh, cool it. she's still here, aren't you, kylie? Kylie, awesome job surviving the first wave of embarrassment.<eos> I just gritted my teeth and went somewhere else.<eos> Thattagirl.<eos> i'll grab you a soda.<eos> For you ladies, i assume two giant buckets of wine?
Now let's enjoy the bluegrass stylings of the country bear jamboree.<eos> So, you guys have any video games?<eos> Nope, but my mama brought some of these boom potatoes back from Iraq.<eos> Set 'em up again.<eos> So, I'll hide, and you guys count to 100.
I'll steal from other babies.<eos> I'll go to the park and forage for nuts and berries.<eos> You prick.<eos> Why am I holding this baby?<eos> I'm not being sexist but one of you girls needs to take this off me before I drop it on its head.
Sohee, you've known her since Junior High, so you must have been close...<eos> Was there ever a time that Un-joo seemed suicidal to you?<eos> No.<eos> I'm sorry, if we had just left school quickly...<eos> No, you three were just going to the bathroom...
Hey Eun-yeong, what's the truth?<eos> Is it true that When Un-joo died you were in the classroom?<eos> Of course.<eos> Then what is Un-joo's sister talking about?<eos> You guys had a fight with Un-joo didn't you?
It violates all the rules of dating etiquette.<eos> I am gonna look desperate, he has to do us a favor, and then he can make fun of me for it.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> Fine.<eos> I will call him, but if he does not sleep with me after this, it is your fault ¬®C all of you.
She doesn't appreciate you.<eos> She is my mother, all right?<eos> That doesn't make it right.<eos> Okay.<eos> It's time for the two new kids to stay the hell out of it, and as for you two, I expect you both to understand.
I was with you when you created that pretty great company, and so was Peyton.<eos> Maybe your mom made it bigger, but you created it all by yourself.<eos> You did.<eos> You made it great before your mom even stepped into the picture.<eos> You guys don't know anything about it.
Steve and Tony smell terrific, and yes, they have great taste in beer, but they are demons.<eos> Let's just try to avoid them.<eos> You know, let's just chill out this relationship, - put a little separation between us. - All right.<eos> Whatever.<eos> What, it takes 3 of you ladies to get a stain out of my chair?
erika is a little freaked out about the insemination.<eos> oh, it's not so bad.<eos> our friend steven's gonna be the donor.<eos> he works for calvin, so he's totally gorgeous.<eos> if you two decide to have a family, where will you get your sperm from?
I just finished color-coding 150 R.S.V.P.S because your fianc√©e isn't happy with a simple yes or no.<eos> Have I mentioned what a great job you're doing with that?<eos> Doesn't she have her own assistant?<eos> Come on.<eos> It's a whole bonding thing for you two.
Are you coming?<eos> - No.<eos> He's gonna hang with us.<eos> - I'm gonna hang with them.<eos> You are totally making me reconsider fucking boys.
- Circle?<eos> - I mean, she's retired...<eos> That's what I'd like to do, retire.<eos> Ow!<eos> You're mothers and so many of you presume that you run Christian homes, you must start by sowing the seeds in your children.
Don Miguel √Ångel has helped sort out the formalities.<eos> I'm not going to die, am I, Dad?<eos> What makes you think that?<eos> It would be a shame if I were to die now, just when everything is starting to go well.<eos> Camino has come to say goodbye because she's going to Pamplona for a while for treatment and she wants to say that she'll miss you all a lot

- There now, cheer up.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> . Did he answer?<eos> . - I'm sitting here.<eos> - What are you doing?
I don't get it.<eos> I sawwhat happened in the corridor.<eos> What you did crossed every line.<eos> You should never do that to a pupil.<eos> I'm talking about abuse and you're babbling about the mother's work.
To men.<eos> No value to men.<eos> Yes,it's always men.<eos> Here we go again.<eos> Okay,you two,n'geal y kw,Xena: Princess Warrior,on me,okay?
Really?<eos> Is that why you dumped Daniel the second he got in the way of your career ambitions?<eos> I guess I shouldn't be surprised.<eos> That's exactly what Wilhelmina would have done.<eos> You two are a lot more alike than I thought.
Happy shredding.<eos> - Betty, you've proved you have rare potential.<eos> - Look, if you want to go work for Wilhelmina,be my guest. ...Maybe you were The One.<eos> If you think you'd be so much happier working for Wilhelmina, go.<eos> You two are a lot more alike than I thought.
Yeah, I know.<eos> Could you, uh, could you try a little faster?<eos> 'cause I see something approaching that looks female.<eos> I'm not entirely proud of my choice of boxers.<eos> You two again?
You be-What-Ed them?<eos> Sage and i used to do all of our james perse t-Shirts,<eos> You know, to jazz 'em up a little.<eos> And you always say how much you love our clothes.<eos> On you. Because you're 16, and you can wear rhinestone jeans and crystal headbands.
Marco told you.<eos> He is so fired.<eos> Stop firing people.<eos> Marco didn't tell me.<eos> You girls are underestimating me.
I try not to judge when I don't have all the details, but you were pretty hard on her out there.<eos> I mean, it's obvious that your sister likes to act tough, but underneath, I think she's pretty vulnerable.<eos> I... I wish you were right, but I know my sister.<eos> Just look at what happened here today.<eos> Now, I may not know everything that went down with you guys in the past, but I saw this one from start to finish.
Once again.<eos> Am I boring you?<eos> I did see the movie.<eos> Not the same thing, and the questions on your test will reflect the book, not the movie.<eos> So, if you'd stop wasting my time, I could maybe. excuse me, mr. Matthews, but if I'm here, and you're here, doesn't that make it.
- We're only paid for what we do.<eos> - But I want this barn cleared.<eos> By tonight.<eos> Keep working.<eos> All of you.
I'm used to dealing with bullies, although I thought I left them all back in high school.<eos> My question is very personal.<eos> How do you do it? How do you... How do you stay so upbeat and wonderful?<eos> It's not easy.<eos> But I have help. I have all of you.
You guys were the ones bullying Noguchi!<eos> Yeah. If you hadn't done that to him, nothing would have happened!<eos> So it's my fault?<eos> It's all my fault?<eos> You were doing it, tool
Damn, always the same!<eos> Once we have something, we remove it.<eos> But who?<eos> And Julia?<eos> It is not with you?
I want to throw myself out the window.<eos> No, Jacinta. We let you do.<eos> Or take your pills to die.<eos> Hey, hey ... a moment.<eos> You two ... you would not hide my pills for the heart?
Rebecca's in a confessional mood.<eos> You wanna fill your mom in?<eos> It's nothing she doesn't already know.<eos> Oh,apparently,your dear,deflowered little girl would've screwed my husband in a heartbeat.<eos> You two,you deserve each other.
Wh...you know,mom,actually,I-I have booked a spa for sarah in...in ojai.<eos> - Yeah,ojai springs spa.<eos> - Oh.<eos> But you know what?<eos> You...you guys have plans.
I'm not gay.<eos> hi.You girls are back already.<eos> - You are so busted,mom.<eos> - You promised me,mother, and now you've just totally been plotting.<eos> I wasn't plotting.You girls were busy.
It always does.That's what marriage is.<eos> And if it doesn'T... never mind.<eos> well,if it doesn't,then you have to acknowledge it, have the courage to let go,hurt like holy hell and move on.<eos> I...you know,I'm not lecturing.I am not lecturing.<eos> You two are grown-ups and perfectly capable of taking care of yourselves.
You spend so much time trying to get sb to love you that you can't help anybody.<eos> That's enough,justin.<eos> Oh,what are you,the protective mother now?<eos> Because in case you missed it, your daughter's been living here all summer,wishing she was a walker.<eos> You know,you two are the same.
Okay,how about this?<eos> Robert,I hate your guts for making me do this.<eos> It's your hairdresser. Did you make a decision,up or down?<eos> Uh,I-I don't know. You know what?<eos> You-You guys pick.
I CAN'T BELIEVE ALEX IS DOING THIS DANIEL.<eos> THEY'RE FAMILY.<eos> EVEN ERICA KANE FORGAVE HER DAUGHTER KENDALL WHEN SHE SLEPT WITH HER FOURTH HUSBAND.<eos> "ALL MY CHILDREN. " IT'S JUST SOMETHING I KNOW.<eos> WHAT ARE YOU TWO DOING HERE?
- How about a donut with a side of muffin.<eos> So, what time are we supposed to be there, anyway? - Where?<eos> - Yale.<eos> Oh, yeah, hon, I need directions 'cause Morey MapQuested it but the campus is big.<eos> I didn't know you guys all wanted to come.
Talking about it doesn't help--not to you, and certainly not to Dr. Beer Pong.<eos> Well, I'm billing you for a whole hour, so, uh, is there anything else on your mind?<eos> I mean, I'm sorry, but this time, Gaby has just crossed the line, and I will not make myself sit through her wedding.<eos> Julie thinks I'm overreacting.<eos> You don't think I'm overreacting, do you?
I swear to love and cherish you every moment of every day of my life?<eos> I mean,that's not real.I mean,that's not how it works,right?<eos> It does,at first,but then it... it passes.<eos> No,it doesn'T.<eos> You guys are just used to it.That's all.You already have it.
We just have to look for a guy who could be dressed as anything and who's anywhere a train might go.<eos> Last tuesday, a bunch of prisoners put a tiny bird in your food and you ate it.<eos> I wasn't going to say anything, but now I want you to suffer.<eos> Me and Randy were just beginning our journey, and Joy was trying to end hers, by giving birth to her half-sister's overdue baby.<eos> Whichever one of you pregnant bitches thinks you're going next, you are wrong.
I'm not so certain about that.<eos> If she doesn't,i'm not sure that's my fault.<eos> There's a reason she was so quick to believe me.<eos> There's a fire-Eater in the ladies lounge.<eos> You two should set a meeting,
Look, I'm A 38-Year-Old Single Man Who Hasn't Been Single Since He Was 18 And Doesn't Know If He Wants To Be Single Now.<eos> So What's The Harm In Blowing Off Some Steam For A Couple Hours, Pretending That This Isn't The Hardest Thing I've Ever Been Through In My Life?<eos> You Women Talk About Your Feelings.<eos> We Pretend We Don't Have Any.<eos> But It Doesn't Mean We Don't Hurt As Much As You.
I oughta 5150 your skinny-- rebecca is not-- have you even talked to her?<eos> I believe her.<eos> Munchausen.<eos> These people are exceptional,spectacular liars.<eos> You two,maybe we couldtake it down a notch.
I swear to denounce the Civil Guard.<eos> - What do you say? You crazy?<eos> - I'm serious.<eos> very serious. Do not oblige me.<eos> Come drop. There are only two of you.
Rachel went into a coma, and 4 days later, she died.<eos> I've never heard any of this.<eos> Well, it was last spring, and the university doesn't exactly advertise unexpldened aiaths on campus.<eos> For wha ile, people thought maybe it was a drug overdose.<eos> But you knew better.
Ted: Oh. No.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> New jersey is not "pretty much new york."<eos> You are not "pretty much new yorkers."
1 day before the competition<eos> What about taking a rest after injection?<eos> Captain' what did you say?<eos> We don't have time I am fine after injection<eos> You better go to the Medical Inspection Room l'm fine. I want to be together with all of you
What is this<eos> What is this?<eos> I don't know<eos> What is this isn't it an electric saw?<eos> No lt's a teaching tool for you
It's our little incentive.<eos> Would you ever risk your life for something like that?<eos> [ SCOFFS ] No, I would not.<eos> Is that why you drive so carefully with us?<eos> No, I drive carefully with you because I wouldn't know what to say if they pulled me up and you were in the back.
Doesn't matter.<eos> Just give him one set.<eos> Why don't you get them here?<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey. You two.
Is there anyone here who just told her parents:... .."I want to go to study in a midrasha".<eos> And her parents without arguing said:... .."Please, go and learn?"<eos> Of course not.<eos> Clearly you had family members who opposed it. Who said you'd be wasting your time. Who said it has no practical use.<eos> So why do you, dear girls, go against the tide?
Molly Zimik, Manipur.<eos> Mary Ralte, Mizoram.<eos> Wow!<eos> You have come from the furthest reaches of India.<eos> You are our special guests.
Because in the days to come whether life goes well for you or not, whether you have something to call your..<eos> ..own or not, whether you win or lose, these seventy minutes are something.. ..that nobody can ever take away from you.<eos> Nobody.<eos> So I thought, I will not tell you how to play today's match.<eos> You will.
Save us Vidya didi!<eos> Preeti, Aliya, Bindia, Mary, Nethra..<eos> Come! Quick!<eos> Come here girls!<eos> You girls are taking the penalty.
Honey, if you want to survive, you will apologize and tell her that she...<eos> Tell her she's hot.<eos> - Tell her what?<eos> - Just do it.<eos> No offense, but, uh... you sisters, you own your own business, you're all beautiful.
- He's not a racist.<eos> - I know.<eos> He's a friend.<eos> But that is not something for a kids' assistant coach to say, no less for a government employee, which is what he is.<eos> The three of you scare me.
That's why your mother is right in all things.<eos> Now say no more about it. No more!<eos> Thank you, Istiak.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> Come on, you three, now.
It would have been so easy to lessen your suffering by divulging the secret.<eos> And yet, he never did.<eos> Have you yet asked yourself why that is?<eos> My father didn't mistrust Flint.<eos> My father mistrusted all of you.
No, that's not happening.<eos> Oh, I think it's happening.<eos> No. No!<eos> No quarantine!<eos> No, not you... the O.R.
!<eos> Perhaps you prefer your guests to be ruined in silence.<eos> Go.<eos> Is it the putrid throat?<eos> I'll stay and look after you all.
And let me be very clear about this.<eos> This campaign is not about Bernie Sanders.<eos> It is not about Hillary Clinton.<eos> It is not about anybody else.<eos> It is about you.
You looking for this?<eos> What were you doing in that house?<eos> Same thing as you...<eos> looking for William Torrance.<eos> The only difference is I'm working for the president, and you're working for the woman who was stupid enough to let a traitor into her home.
Donatello, good to see ya.<eos> Sorry about your cat.<eos> You - - You know me?<eos> I made you.<eos> I made all of you, even the ones who aren't born yet.
On the other hand, if I stay, you'll get mad at me and we can have crazy angry sex again.<eos> Or you go, you still get the crazy sex and you get the welcome home sex, which, not to brag, is where I really shine.<eos> Oh, I'm gonna puke.<eos> We're just kissing.<eos> Oh, not you.
You bring friend.<eos> Look like he make someone's husband angry?<eos> Oh, it's not knife.<eos> Ice pick?<eos> Oh, you black ops all the same, eh?
What?<eos> Oh, come on, he knows.<eos> You know, don't you, Mikey?<eos> What?<eos> You two?
And the funny thing is... It's getting really hard to remember that Mercedes.<eos> Even when I got the call earlier,<eos> I didn't think, "Oh, this must be some kind of mistake,"<eos> or, you know, "They must not mean me."<eos> That's because of you guys.
This could be worse.<eos> We've survived far more difficult things, not just in Glee Club, but in life.<eos> You know, screw it.<eos> We've had to fight for everything we've earned in our lives, and this is just the beginning of a new fight.<eos> I am so proud of you all.
Did you ever feel threatened?<eos> Did you...<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Derek Finley is innocent.<eos> I mean, you guys can...
My name is Avery Ryan.<eos> I was a victim of cyber crime.<eos> Like you, I posted on social media, checked my bank account balance online, even kept the confidential files of my psychological practice on my computer.

So, we're really getting our daughter back?<eos> Yeah, but it's not gonna be that big of a deal.<eos> I mean, you guys missed the good years.<eos> Now, it's just gonna be margaritas, Pottery Barn, fighting our family's tendency toward obesity as we slide into oblivion.<eos> First you guys, and then me quickly thereafter.
My name is Avery Ryan.<eos> I was a victim of cyber crime.<eos> Like you, I posted on social media, checked my bank account balance online, even kept the confidential files of my psychological practice on my computer.
Hey.<eos> What if I get whacked by one of those guys before we hit LaGuardia?<eos> Doubtful-- these guys are all marshals and NYPD riding along just in case.<eos> I don't believe it.<eos> I don't know who's scarier-- you or the mob.

She should be buried in Chicago, near her husband.<eos> Dad, he's Jewish, and it's customary for him to eat her heart.<eos> He'll go to hell if he doesn't.<eos> She is staying here.<eos> And now, so will you, in a Puerto Rican prison.
I think we left ‚Ä≠the brownies in the car.<eos> - Oh, I'll get those.<eos> - Well, way to go, pal.<eos> Okay, what is wrong with you people?<eos> I am dying here, ‚Ä≠trying to hold down two jobs while you enable a once-proud man who is clearly having a talent-free breakdown.
- Yeah, I would say it is.<eos> - My love, you must rest.<eos> The surgeon and I will discuss the procedure.<eos> Prepare, master of my life, to live anew.<eos> Patience be with you all.
I missed you this morning.<eos> I missed you too. [gasps] Oops. Raj?<eos> I am so sorry I walked in on you.<eos> Oh. [scoffs] - Of course,<eos> I didn't know there was a "you."
I am so sorry I walked in on you.<eos> Oh. [scoffs] - Of course,<eos> I didn't know there was a "you."<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - How long has there been A "you?" If there is a "you."
Why are so hell-bent on revenge?<eos> Let it go already.<eos> C-colleagues.<eos> Friends.<eos> Mellie, I devoted my life to him, to you, to the Grant cause.
Oh, I know.<eos> You think I'm crazy.<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> Well these days crazy stays alive.<eos> If I was you people, I'd get out of here before the zombie aliens come back and infect us all.
Do you know who I am?<eos> Yes, general, we know who you are.<eos> We know now.<eos> So this is what they mean by civilian leadership.<eos> You two?
Remind him he doesn't have a very good track record<eos> - for keeping promises.<eos> - Please stop talking.<eos> The other side is on the brink of colapse.<eos> I plan on pestering all of you until I'm safely returned to the land of the living.
- I should be at school.<eos> - No, no, Kyle, you shouldn't do that.<eos> Try to relax, and just take a breath.<eos> What happened to me?<eos> Who are you?
I can tell you so many things, like the time that I...<eos> Oh, no, not you.<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> Come here.<eos> Yeah, you.
Eh... maybe... maybe the fever is kicking back in, but I think I just saw a guy fly off on a dragon!<eos> A dragon!<eos> I mean, how crazy would that be?<eos> Where am I?<eos> Who are each of you?
Wait a second.<eos> Agent Booth!<eos> You and...<eos> You're...<eos> The two of you?
Excuse me?<eos> Juicy Fruit.<eos> - How did you know?<eos> - I'm Ajay.<eos> My father told me about all of you.
Of a sort.<eos> Well, yeah, I can pay the ransom.<eos> I can get however much money you need.<eos> Someone's trying to kill you.<eos> Yeah, you.
You underestimate how much I like a challenge.<eos> You lie to me again, you no longer have an attorney.<eos> Frank, find out how the prosecution knew about Max's first trial.<eos> Whoever slipped the information could be a possible suspect.<eos> - And the rest of you, prove I wasn't wrong to hire you.
You need to listen to your mother.<eos> You understand?<eos> You keep to your lessons.<eos> Be a good boy.<eos> Remember, all I did was for you.
Shake your chains to earth like dew Which in sleep had fallen on you -<eos> Ye are many - they are few.<eos> Shelley has the answer to my questions.<eos> Who am I?<eos> Who are you?
~ I need to explain.<eos> ~ I'm not sure we're interested.<eos> ~ Look, I was used. ~ Yeah, so were we.<eos> I thought the Antique Researchers were the good guys.<eos> They told me you were the treasure hunters, stealing their permissions.
Bum-ju and I sure missed you.<eos> - It's so great to see you again, bumi.<eos> And you too, bum-ju. [bum-ju screeches]<eos> - Well done, kids.<eos> I'm proud of you all for finding korra.
He disappeared with the badge and uniform.<eos> You see, sometimes when you change on the outside, you change on the inside.<eos> That doesn't mean you didn't make mistakes.<eos> But you learn from them.<eos> Just as I've learned from all of you.
She's always stealing them!<eos> Also, she has a serious heart condition.<eos> I'm six years old, and tap dancing is my favoritest thing, even if it's not good for my pacemaker.<eos> Aww! That is one quality pacemaker.<eos> The rest of you might as well give up now, 'cause I'm gonna take home the...
Holy moley.<eos> What the...? !<eos> Oh, it's hopeless!<eos> What's hopeless?<eos> Who the hell are you?
Hi, buddy.<eos> Surprise.<eos> You were so passionate.<eos> Read... my... lips.<eos> I am going to get revenge on every last one of you.
Look, Liz...<eos> If there's anything I can do to help, I promise I will.<eos> Good.<eos> You need to.<eos> Whoever stole that blood put a lot of lives in danger and risks exposing all of you, my daughter included.
Let's call it what it is...<eos> An injustice.<eos> And tomorrow's our last opportunity to show everyone what you and Julia have accomplished.<eos> We'll both be there.<eos> Bombshell's counting on you.
So, the warden has asked us to draft a memo to distribute to the inmates, telling them that we care, the services that are available, etc.<eos> You've got to be kidding me.<eos> I'm sorry, but how is this a good use of our time, exactly?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> I don't know about the rest of you, but I've got real work to do.
Terrorist!<eos> Terrorist!<eos> Yes, from some points of view, you could say I'm a terrorist.<eos> I instill fear, terror into those that want me silenced, the ones that want all of you silenced!<eos> So if fighting for you, the ones that can't fight for themselves, makes me a terrorist, then I guess that's exactly what I am.
A kidnapping.<eos> Respect.<eos> I was secretly worried you might not be able to pull off my bachelor party.<eos> Yeah, it wasn't that secret.<eos> You two?
I would prefer neither.<eos> The Croton Aqueduct is sufficient.<eos> And yet its most staunch advocates agree that system will support a population of no more than two million.<eos> And in what fantasy land will we need more water than that?<eos> That's the problem with you Anglo-Saxons, you lack a talent for grandeur.
All she had to go through.<eos> You children, losing her so young.<eos> Your father not around.<eos> I cared for you.<eos> I cared for all of you.
- Yeah, what about Hecky Nash,<eos> Phil Holtz, Little Moe and Two-Tone?<eos> There's a lot of you getting bumped off this week, probably friends of yours.<eos> That make you nervous?<eos> The only thing that makes me nervous is you clowns saying I know something I don't.
And decorative.<eos> Interesting question.<eos> We're dating!<eos> Surprise!<eos> The two of you?
I'd say no, because anything that takes us off course of saving Henry is selfish.<eos> But of course you would think that was the way to go.<eos> - Bugger off.<eos> - What, you think I'm being selfish?<eos> I'm risking my life for all of you, every moment I'm here aligned against him.
I really thought you were staying at Megan's last night.<eos> She's out of town doing depositions.<eos> You know, I'm...<eos> I'm just gonna... I'm gonna go.<eos> When'd you two get back together?
Swing and a miss, buddy.<eos> You're all horrible people.<eos> And I really wish horrible, horrible things happen to you.<eos> Oh, and because they might, I can still offer my competitive rates.<eos> I would definitely get fire insurance if I were you.
Ally McBeal played on that show.<eos> I could be like that cool army guy on JAG.<eos> I've always wanted an excuse to wear white pants.<eos> We'll do it.<eos> With you two lookers, I won't need this anymore.
Someone get Syd a water, please.<eos> Listen, what can we possibly give you that you don't already have?<eos> The courage to finish a word? Mm-hmm.<eos> Whatev.<eos> I can't deal with you guys right now.
Place cock in ass.<eos> My robes!<eos> Quickly!<eos> Strike fear and quiet concern.<eos> Our quarrel is not with you.
I did that.<eos> It's me and my ex-wife.<eos> Okay, you know what?<eos> Um... My roommates are really scared of you, but I know you're a good man, and I know you don't want the four of us living in a dangerous apartment.<eos> The four of you?
Is there anything else you desire, huh?<eos> A new ship?<eos> Your choice of weapons is lousy, Pablo.<eos> Where can I get some quality blasters?<eos> I wouldn't be too picky, being on the run like you obviously are.
But let's see what happens when he is not the key to their survival.<eos> To reach your final challenge, you must pass through my ray shield.<eos> The switch to turn it off is on the other side.<eos> The syringe on the platform contains a highly electrolytic serum that will allow you to pass through the shield.<eos> However, it is toxic to all but one of you. Cano toni. Passo-gran-sheesay.
"Welcome Stapes"?<eos> It's the smallest bone in the human body.<eos> Well, we didn't know her name, so...<eos> Thanks.<eos> She's so lucky to have all of you.
Hey. What's the deal with you and Melanie?<eos> Why is she giving you the cold shoulder?<eos> Something might have happened last night at the stakeout.<eos> Really?<eos> You two?
A weapon actually.<eos> Uhm.. I have to make one quick adjustment first.<eos> Oops, guess it still needs work.<eos> You're a joke.<eos> And you two.. Who's idea was to waste my time with this imbecile?
Where is Hetty?<eos> Here, Mr. Deeks.<eos> All of you, upstairs now.<eos> What's Granger up to now?<eos> Like you, I can't speculate what the assistant director is up to.
But I have been trying, and trying hard to be a better person.<eos> Thanks for showing me I had it right before.<eos> Look, I'm sorry we made you feel a little suffocated, but were you really just gonna sneak away?<eos> Well, it's just... I really miss the city.<eos> I know you guys love it here, and that's fine,
Okay.<eos> I'll take your lead.<eos> Roy?<eos> Where are my keys?<eos> Who are you?
Charlie, Meyer, thank you for coming.<eos> I won't keep you very long since you have such full portions on your plates.<eos> What's that doing here?<eos> I had it delivered so that Mr. Masseria could see that I'm as good as my word.<eos> The two of you?
- Hey!<eos> - I paid for it.<eos> Well, there'd be no "it" to pay for if I hadn't done all the work.<eos> My goodness, this molehill is becoming a mountain.<eos> You guys work it out, while I put together an Alpine costume.
- Hey!<eos> - I paid for it.<eos> Well, there'd be no "it" to pay for if I hadn't done all the work.<eos> My goodness, this molehill is becoming a mountain.<eos> You guys work it out, while I put together an Alpine costume.
Cody, that is so not a good idea. ‚ô™ A thousand pretty words ain't gonna mean that much... ‚ô™<eos> Hey, Lemon, I just happened to have this extra white wine spritzer.<eos> I thought we could... Not now, Cody!<eos> No way.<eos> You two?
Cos they said nine to me.<eos> Oh, yes!<eos> Fuck me harder!<eos> Oh, yes, I like it when you do that. Oh!<eos> Who are you?
Is that a band?<eos> [Chuckles] No.<eos> A basketball team.<eos> Sports?<eos> Party on, you two.
Stop that.<eos> You said this was a safe space.<eos> Okay, that's enough.<eos> I don't feel safe anymore. (laughter)<eos> I don't know what you're all laughing at, since a whole bunch of you have STDs!
No problem-- we just had a faulty refrigeration unit, that's all.<eos> They flew another one in. Uh-huh.<eos> I think I shared a seat with it.<eos> All right, well, listen, I'm gonna take a look around if nobody has a problem with that.<eos> You two?
30% off everything in the store for the next month.<eos> - Shameless.<eos> - And...<eos> I'm throwing a barbecue for everyone in town.<eos> Because -- because, you guys, we are a family.
For Spider-Man's dad.<eos> "this is Spider-Man's dad.<eos> This is the Hulk's dad.<eos> This is Iron Man's dad."<eos> I don't know if you guys could tell when I told you.
Yes, I swear.<eos> Do you swear to commit yourself to the teachings of the Holy Mother Church and to look upon the good of the kingdom, unifying and pacifying them?<eos> I will not only swear that... but I will make them bigger with all my efforts.<eos> Yes, I swear. Amen.<eos> And you, noblemen, knights, and priests.
You test me, Abdul?<eos> I test everybody, Hakeem.<eos> You passed.<eos> He failed.<eos> Let this be a lesson to all of you, of the importance of this boy.
No worries.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> All I've known is that winning is everything.<eos> And we can do this right here right now.<eos> But you guys.
We've got a situation. Grab your kit.<eos> Pros only.<eos> Everybody stay behind the yellow tape. Watch me work my magic.<eos> Watch well.<eos> One of you will be lucky enough to become my intern.
Get up.<eos> Face the wall.<eos> Let's see hands.<eos> Turn around.<eos> That means you.
And like two months later,<eos> Debs, you wanted to show off Walter to your friend Susie.<eos> And you guys started looking for him, and when you found him, he was all dried up and dead.<eos> Now... see, you guys are that turtle, okay?<eos> And Dad's you.
it's a little editing.<eos> Now the sifting. See?<eos> We separate and aerate those flour particles to make them absorb liquids better.<eos> Someone should sift my dad.<eos> Oh, you Gallaghers.
It's-it's gonna be fine.<eos> Anybody want to go check on Sofia?<eos> Why?<eos> 'Cause when somebody's talking about taking someone's baby away, you want you to see your baby.<eos> Oh, you guys.
She didn't tell me out loud.<eos> Who has two thumbs and is psychic?<eos> Moi.<eos> Wow.<eos> You two... together.
And what about security cameras?<eos> They don't record.<eos> Of course they don't.<eos> All right, I want to speak to Clay when he's conscious.<eos> The rest of you, just...
- It's so good to see you.<eos> - It's good to see you all together.<eos> Thank you so much, Santa.<eos> You've changed our lives, really.<eos> And you mine.
- Yes, mentally.<eos> - Yes.<eos> By the way, the name of this small village is Dhuliya.<eos> And I'm the village chief.<eos> Who are you?
She's in the middle of the road.<eos> Brother, careful.<eos> Brother!<eos> Brother!<eos> You two?
I still don't see why we need blair for this.<eos> I mean, don't you read "gossip girl"?<eos> Extortion's what I do all day.<eos> This is more than headbands and high school.<eos> The two of you here together?
Raj says he can teach you...<eos> What did you call it?<eos> I don't know-- some Indian meditation crap.<eos> I see.<eos> Well, I assume, since the rest of you have set the bar so low, you're saving the most impressive contribution for last.
Welcome back, Amanda.<eos> We were all wondering where you disappeared to.<eos> Is that why you broke into these offices in the middle of the night?<eos> Wow.<eos> I am flattered that you of all people think I'm that devious.
'Cause it looked more like cake...with frosting.<eos> Okay, you got me.<eos> It was a cupcake.<eos> I gave him a cupcake.<eos> Amy, did you wake up this morning, and have a birthday party with John all by yourself, just the two of you?
You're lying!<eos> He's not lying.<eos> We left it in the middle of the road.<eos> "packo" ran off with it.<eos> Who are you?
Sam Hanna.<eos> Frank Scarli.<eos> How many guys did Traynor brief?<eos> Three.<eos> I need witness statements from all of you.
You're making me hungry.<eos> Let's do this.<eos> Detective Jackman. Can we speak to you for a moment?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Who are you?
Thank you very much, Ms. Bennett.<eos> And, again, I'm sorry for your loss.<eos> Chief Monohan, please, whoever did this, find them.<eos> I'll do my best.<eos> So, I know that most of you were really close to Barbara.
Don't go anywhere.<eos> Portland, keep your dials tuned to K-100.<eos> We'll be back after this word from Candoli's pizza.<eos> Get it while it's hot.<eos> You guys, really fun stuff in there.
- What kind of monster is he?<eos> Zack, I will be your carcass.<eos> - All acting is an art, Whether some great work on broadway Or a production of romeo and juliet<eos> For why else would victoria chase Be standing here before you on this humble stage?<eos> Because, believe it or not, I was once where you are.
I solemnly swear to support and defend<eos> The constitution of the United States<eos> From all enemies foreign and domestic.<eos> How'd huang take the bad news?<eos> If I were you, I'd keep my distance.
You wouldn't.<eos> Yeah, that'll work.<eos> George here explodes--<eos> Ugh! Would you people stop saying that?<eos> The ferropodous gets rid of you guys. And after having fed, the creature goes into hibernation, until it's next cycle. Which is when I scoop it up and escape through the sewers.
I'm sorry, but I don't have time for this.<eos> I have to set up for the vigil--<eos> Who are you?<eos> You're an abomination.<eos> You deserve what you get, all of you.
You know, like I said, Ian came around the village the last couple weeks, saying he was a changed man.<eos> I didn't buy it.<eos> You have to give me more than that.<eos> Like what?<eos> If-If Ian was buying the land to develop it and evict all of you, you had motive to kill him.
Stop chasing her.<eos> We are a respectable family.<eos> Darn, I totally forgot. They are a respectable family.<eos> You get inside.<eos> Who are you?
No, it can't be.<eos> You incompetent fool!<eos> No!<eos> I am Robin Hood, your humble servant.<eos> It is for you that I live to fight the evil that chokes this country.
Move!<eos> Move!<eos> Move! Positions.<eos> We'll have to surrender.<eos> I'd lay down your weapons, if I were you.
It's my father!<eos> Honey!<eos> A few months ago, some of you have demanded my resignation. Now you ask me again director of the internship.<eos> I never accepted your proposal if this is because the other candidate ... is ... Jacques Noiret.<eos> It is my duty, not for you ... but to the students ... not to leave the center in his hands, knowing, as everyone knows, his past.
- It's a creepy idea.<eos> I don't like it either, Marko.<eos> Do we have to do this?<eos> The money's good. More than good.<eos> - You two?
- My brother Joseph and I have had two families.<eos> The first one...<eos> Well, let's just say it didn't work out too well.<eos> But over the years, we made ourselves a new one.<eos> And it was to this family, alof you, That his heart really belonged.
I mean, she's a child whose family was broken apart.<eos> So of course she's happy to see you together again.<eos> But you don't think I'm safe.<eos> I...<eos> I'm... I'm worried about all of you.
Rtesia?<eos> Malaysia,on an island called,um, tioman,uh,which you might recognize from the movie "south pacific."<eos> So he's really available.<eos> You know,tioman is famous for,uh, the red flying squirrels and,um,the... the slow loris and the walking catfish.<eos> Well,I'm really happy for you... all of you,including the catfish.
This will keep your eyes from hurting.<eos> KANG Jin-woo...<eos> Hold your head up, son.<eos> Mr. Kim...<eos> Now, come here all of you.
I'm sincerely happy for you guys.<eos> I love Alvey.<eos> - So do I.<eos> - I can see that.<eos> You know what, you guys...
Besides, it's completely wrong.<eos> All you do is check into your tight end.<eos> Put your lunch away.<eos> You're not eating.<eos> And neither are you, for that matter.
AS SOON AS WE SAW THE FOOD IT WAS LIKE A FEEDY FRENZY, MAN.<eos> THIS IS TERRIBLE.<eos> AND PAID THE PRICE.<eos> I ATE TOO MUCH SOON.<eos> YOU GUYS BETTER BE READY FOR THE CHALLENGE SOON.
Your mother told me she was having a tough time with you.<eos> I mean, not easy.<eos> She's an amazing woman, your mother.<eos> She did everything on her own, just like that.<eos> She fought all her life, for you, and other things.
Please stop!<eos> You can't kill me now.<eos> Why not?<eos> That detective.<eos> He's suspicious of you all.
Sometimes I just have to deal with strange people on this list.<eos> Morning, dudes ; time to get to work.<eos> - Okay, see you when you get back.<eos> - No no. You guys got to work.<eos> With you guys here, we got two more mouths to feed.
Sycorax strong, Sycorax mighty.<eos> Sycorax rock,"<eos> as in the modern sense, "They rock!"<eos> "THEY will die."<eos> Not "YOU will die," "THEY will die." Who's they?
" Unholy Union (Karmic Justice) "<eos> What's up with this line?<eos> Our Father, who art in Heaven...<eos> Next!<eos> Hey, what do you two think you're doing?
Because that's what we wanted.<eos> We aren't being controlled by anyone!<eos> It's an equivalent exchange.<eos> We teach you the way to refine the Philosopher's Stone, and then you use the Stone, and turn us into humans.<eos> I can't trust you.
No, don't be grossed out.<eos> We have to honor it.<eos> We honor you.<eos> We honor you.<eos> All 75 million of you.
and if we die, we die unto the Lord;<eos> whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's.<eos> Blessed be the dead who die in the Lord<eos> Even so saith the spirit, for they rest from their labors.<eos> The lord be with you.
- Crystal.<eos> I'm not exactly the guy you should be asking that question to.<eos> Ah, come on, Nick.<eos> You know her. You talk to her.<eos> Love or not, she doesn't want to be with you.
Excuse me, the last time we spoke we were all kumbaya talkin' African bees taking over the hive.<eos> Chaos and a new power structure, you and me.<eos> We were?<eos> Then I learned about the subpoena.<eos> You're dirty laundry is about to be aired in a major trial, diminishing your contribution to the new power structure, and, unfortunately, eliminating my contribution to you.
Let's go.<eos> Wait here.<eos> Hi, Dad.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I couldn't be there with you that day.
Stole that man's watch right there.<eos> Why don't you go talk with him?<eos> I'm looking for a guy who may have come in a couple days back.<eos> Bartender thought he may have sat with you.
She says she has collateral.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll go.<eos> Knowing Libby, it's silverware and jewelry, same as before.<eos> Well, if you want, yeah, I can go with you.
Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> How are you doing?<eos> Good.<eos> Hey, can I talk to you for a second?
But Naomi made the call, end of story for me.<eos> And when your pal pulled a gun, might as well have shot himself in the head...<eos> Here's what I see, okay?<eos> You seem kind of like a trigger-happy whack job to me.<eos> So, let me lay it on the table for you, all right?
Everyone knows you support a deal with Iran.<eos> Just as everyone knows you're already convinced they're cheating on it.<eos> Where's my lawyer?<eos> Where's Mr. Hashem?<eos> I need to talk to you about something.
He's not.<eos> First of all, we... We don't have access to actual conversations, just a record of their calls.<eos> - Oh, please.<eos> - Even if we did, this is the kind of thing that kills careers.<eos> I shouldn't even be talking to you.
You got all your friends here.<eos> You want to make an entrance.<eos> Fine.<eos> I'm impressed.<eos> That's not why I wanted to meet you here.
Our right to confront a hostile witness at trial, Your Honor.<eos> Your Honor, Mr. Mahsud has been the key resource in several federal prosecutions.<eos> Lives have been saved.<eos> His ability to continue that important work depends on his identity remaining a closely held secret.<eos> - I need to talk to you.
Or here's a thought. Why don't we put your guy on the stand?<eos> Let a jury decide how certain they are he's not gonna pick up an AR-15 and shoot them all in their sleep?<eos> Look, if you want to believe the kid's a saint, go ahead.<eos> You go anywhere near Saad Mahsud, I will have you arrested.<eos> It was nice talking to you.
Not if you think about everything he's been through.<eos> He's not happy, Carrie.<eos> I know.<eos> No, I mean... he's really not.<eos> And... and he's got this strange thing about you, which is not helping.
- Just sayin'...<eos> - You're just sayin' what?<eos> Just want everyone here to know that... I'm a law-abiding citizen.<eos> You serious right now?<eos> We're just messing with you, man.
I don't think you understand how vulnerable you are.<eos> I don't think you do.<eos> Mommy, can we go now?<eos> Yes, sweetheart, we can.<eos> Nice talking to you, Carrie.
- That, I promise.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I said, "Wait."<eos> Doesn't seem wrong to you, being here?<eos> I've been trying to reach you.
It won't be long.<eos> Nothing for now, thanks.<eos> Right out front, sir.<eos> What did I say last time?<eos> I can't be seen with you.
Hey, sweetie.<eos> Can you wake up to get to the car?<eos> Sweetie?<eos> She's had a long day.<eos> You sure it's okay, us staying with you?
It's related.<eos> The intelligence community hates her.<eos> And you're caught in the middle.<eos> I must say I'm impressed.<eos> Don't be- - I was married to you for 27 years.
We're on the move.<eos> You go ahead.<eos> I'm gonna ride with Keane.<eos> You sure?<eos> - What about Quinn? - Is he there, too-- with you now?
- If you're even see here...<eos> - I have to-- ...you make this a hundred times worse, you understand that?<eos> Come on.<eos> Let's go somewhere, get a cup of coffee.<eos> I need to talk to you.
Ma'am?<eos> Madam President-Elect?<eos> Hey.<eos> The solicitor general's here.<eos> He wants to talk to you about what happens next.
I couldn't ask you to move out if you never moved in.<eos> Right, yeah, but I've been staying here for months.<eos> Yes, and I love that.<eos> I love that.<eos> I love spending time with you.
Right, yeah, but I've been staying here for months.<eos> Yes, and I love that.<eos> I love that.<eos> I love spending time with you.<eos> In fact, I want to spend more time with you, but I just want some of that time to be apart.
- I can hear you.<eos> - Congratulations.<eos> - Now you know that I think you're gay.<eos> - You're gay.<eos> Well, maybe Ray should move in with you.
Charlie?<eos> - Charlie?<eos> - Alex.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> How come nobody's with you?
He will have men hump you.<eos> I tell you every time... you do not need to live like this.<eos> You don't need to eat and sleep with hounds.<eos> It is my wish.<eos> I dream of you... as you were.
I got a tattoo.<eos> A couple hundred more and I'll catch up with you.<eos> Let's have a baby.<eos> What?<eos> I wanna have a baby with you.
- Who was that?<eos> - Work.<eos> I need to go to Australia.<eos> Just for a couple of days.<eos> Can I come with you?
They knew pretty much everything, actually.<eos> Well, then they know about me.<eos> I'm sure they do.<eos> And they still think you're gonna get into this thing?<eos> And what if they ask why I came down here with you?
You gonna look your dad up?<eos> - Look him up?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I thought that's why you wanted to come down here.<eos> No, I came down here to be with you.
I have to go.<eos> - Where?<eos> I don't know.<eos> They want me to get on a bus.<eos> - You want me to go with you?
- So sorry.<eos> Would you like us to add your name to the room so you can have access to all the guest amenities?<eos> Yes, that would be great.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Well, I'm ashamed to say that I did, Pam, but at least I get to be having pancakes with you here this morning, right?
Sir.<eos> I'm sorry to bother you, but are you telling people you're God?<eos> "I am the one true God."<eos> I go by many names, but Mr. Burton is fine.<eos> I will not take a photo with you.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.<eos> Hey!<eos> I saw you. I know what you did.<eos> You think you can get away with this?<eos> Don't ignore me! I'm talking to you.
Where's everybody?<eos> Inside, sleeping.<eos> I drugged their food.<eos> Jesus, Laurie.<eos> Well, I wanted to talk to you.
And everybody here knows I've made my fair share of mistakes, but there is a very big difference between a sin and a mistake.<eos> Because a mistake is just fucking up?<eos> But a sin... hoohoo.<eos> A sin is when you know something is wrong and you do it anyway.<eos> So, Aggie, my darling wife, my sun and my stars, I look forward to a lifetime of fucking up with you.
And I came back through.<eos> I came back here.<eos> Did I... think about you?<eos> Did I wanna call you?<eos> Did I wanna be with you, Kevin?
Everything I have is gone... because of it.<eos> If you wish to apologize, what happened today... does not begin to cover it.<eos> Where would we have gone?<eos> What?<eos> A long time ago, you asked me to leave Nassau with you to avoid ruin.
Again, please.<eos> Reload.<eos> I beg your pardon, my lord, but she demanded that I relay what follows... Her words precisely... In spite of any protest you offered.<eos> She says she knows that you will be angry and that this will be hard for you to understand... but she said...<eos> She said you should trust that her commitment to you remains inviolable... and that this is no betrayal... but an act of love.
That you wouldn't use your men to force a scenario by which he ends up dead?<eos> I'm not gonna stand by and watch while all our futures are destroyed.<eos> No.<eos> But perhaps it's worth focusing on how hard I'm working to persuade you not to make that decision.<eos> I would far, far rather do this with you than against you.
The pirates offered me a cache of stolen gems to persuade me to surrender.<eos> The cache of gems representing the last remaining share of the Urca plunder.<eos> They're paying for their war with your money.<eos> What is it you think will come from this?<eos> You think I'll commit men and sail with you?
-Sister Kimmy. It's Richard Shakeer-Mohammed.<eos> I had to join a Muslim gang and a white-power gang.<eos> It's sort of a Mrs. Doubtfire situation.<eos> I told you to stop calling me.<eos> Look, you think I really want to be wasting my prison phone time on you?
No. I broke up with Bobby.<eos> And it was worse than I could have imagined.<eos> No.<eos> He killed you, and now you're a ghost?<eos> I don't want to make sexy pottery with you.
But listen up, I know you ain't down with the split, never have been.<eos> - Maybe I can do better.<eos> - You?<eos> Money ain't coming in like it was.<eos> That's why I reached out to you in the first place, put this deal together.
- She's my brother's wife.<eos> Like that would stop you starting up with her again.<eos> Don't get crazy.<eos> Money ain't coming in like it was.<eos> That's why I reached out to you in the first place, put this deal together.
I want to be the one to bring her in.<eos> I keep having to remind you, you don't work here anymore.<eos> She's my husband's campaign manager.<eos> Keith, it would be easier for John if I do this.<eos> Take Agent Fox with you.
So, Jerome's staying here to look after Nicole, all right?<eos> Since when you need my permission?<eos> Aisha, look, this business ain't never been easy, all right?<eos> But it's never been this hard neither.<eos> If I've been taking it out on you, I'm sorry.
No.<eos> Not until Royo calls and we know Isaac's taken care of.<eos> I know you ain't down with the split, never have been, maybe I can do better.<eos> - You?<eos> - That's why I reached out to you in the first place, put this deal together.
- Dad.<eos> Dad.<eos> - I beg you, please.<eos> Don't throw away everything that we have worked for your whole life!<eos> I was just coming to talk to you and your father about campaign managers.
Let's do this.<eos> You got some balls coming back here again.<eos> I got business.<eos> Something for Gabriel.<eos> You think he's gonna do business with you again?
Khasan, I can't do this by myself.<eos> Khasan.<eos> Oh, you're all right.<eos> Come here.<eos> God is with you, little sister.
Find someone who can.<eos> And bring them to us.<eos> You let my wife go, and then we'll talk.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> I'm not negotiating with you.
Nicole, get in the car, babe.<eos> Are you coming with us?<eos> Please.<eos> I need you to get in the car, now.<eos> What's gonna happen to you, Eric?
But they got to know Jadalla's gonna kill them both the second he realizes what they've done.<eos> It's suicide.<eos> They know.<eos> If we can track them, they'll lead us right to Jadalla.<eos> Stay in place, I'll dispatch a tac team to meet you.
Take care of his wound.<eos> As soon as Hamid is through disabling the virus, we'll begin again.<eos> - John.<eos> - Where is he?<eos> I need to talk to you.
Rebecca, I may not know you like I thought I did, but I do know one thing.<eos> I don't want to lose you.<eos> I don't want to lose you, either.<eos> Listen, I have a meeting... later on tonight with the party chairman about suspending my campaign.<eos> If I do that, I... I'd-I'd really like to talk to you.
Return to your studies if you want.<eos> Asim Naseri escaped from the warehouse.<eos> We want to know what operation he's running and how to find him.<eos> I don't know anyone named Naseri.<eos> Eric Carter saw him with you.
Escort them to engineering,<eos> - they'll take it from there.<eos> - Copy that.<eos> I wasn't sure you'd call me back.<eos> I'd-I'd really like to talk to you.
- That's good news.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Now listen.<eos> Your wife's here.<eos> She wants to talk to you.
Uh, are you sure?<eos> He said it a couple times, yeah.<eos> - Andy.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Director Mullins needs to speak with you.
Sir, Daniel just got here.<eos> Thank you for your cooperation, Keith.<eos> Absolutely, anything I can do.<eos> Daniel.<eos> Keith. Did Director Simms reach you?
All right, go get the girl and take her out of here.<eos> Just like that?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Let it go, Sidra.<eos> I'd go with you myself, if you hadn't've broken my damn arm.
If I apologize, you will know it is a lie.<eos> And I do not wish to lie to you ever again.<eos> Leave.<eos> No.<eos> I am going to stay with you.
When he hears the news we are bringing, he will grant us an audience.<eos> No, no.<eos> There's no "we."<eos> I have as much to gain and more to lose than any of us if we fail to see Governor Rogers removed.<eos> I believe I should be with you.
Terms.<eos> When this is through, you'll present this to your people and advocate to accept them.<eos> Every fugitive slave in your camp will receive their immediate emancipation.<eos> With one condition.<eos> Any escaped slave who seeks refuge with you after the ratification of this deal will be surrendered to the law.

Because despite the world reminding her every day of her life that she's undeserving of being given anything by it, that she was unworthy of what little she'd managed to take from it... despite all of that,<eos> she never believed a word of it.<eos> That woman has been fighting the whole goddamn world since the day she was born.<eos> She's a breath away from winning that fight.<eos> For whatever reason, she wants to share the spoils with you.
When I became her rival, I watched the mistakes she made and resolved never to repeat them.<eos> But at the end, when I felt I had surpassed her in every way, it seemed as though there was something she was still trying to say to me.<eos> Surrendering everything she had sacrificed so dearly for, because it would have come at the expense of the one she loved.<eos> She was trying to tell me, I just could not hear her, about what is truly important.<eos> I said no to Marion Guthrie's plan... despite having no alternative and at the risk of losing the entire endeavor because I refuse to situate a man in a position where he might interfere one day with my ability to repair things with you.
Not only that, but when I told you this story, you insinuated yourself into it.<eos> The latest in a line of ill-fated partners, situating yourself such that... were you and I ever to come to blows...<eos> I'd be forced to hesitate before doing you any harm.<eos> - Slow down, I...<eos> - I'm not angry with you.
They use it when someone's been renditioned or black-sited and they want zero accountability.<eos> - Bug...<eos> - I've seen it, buddy.<eos> They erase warrants, records, anything that might make one agency trip over another one.<eos> They just go poof. And so do you.
I've been through it a million times with the lawyers. Really.<eos> I mean, these reports are mostly done for the sake of appearances.<eos> - But...<eos> - What matters is that we ship on time, Kala.<eos> Our clients are depending on us, as I am depending on you.
I've never dated anyone who owned so many books.<eos> I've never dated anyone who drove a matatu.<eos> We do live in different worlds.<eos> Not tonight we don't.<eos> When I'm with you... all the rules... and the logic of everyday life... things that were so important to me... all go away.

Good morning, Milton.<eos> Good morning, Mr. Secretary.<eos> The Chairman is very excited. It's a very big day for us.<eos> - It is.<eos> - We are counting on you.

I must go.<eos> I would like to continue this conversation.<eos> I'll find you.<eos> I know you're angry... but this is how a girl like me tells a boy like you that she has a crush on you.<eos> And instead of laying in bed, wishing she was going out with you and not her current boyfriend... she has decided to do something about it.
No.<eos> You're just as trapped as we are, aren't you?<eos> It's Sebastian.<eos> He's worried about your relationship.<eos> I told him I would talk to you.

[voice echoing] Leave me the fuck alone! No.<eos> You're just as trapped as we are, aren't you?<eos> [Lila] It's Sebastian.<eos> He's worried about your relationship.<eos> I told him I would talk to you.
What matters to me is this.<eos> Right now.<eos> And I know you feel the same.<eos> I do.<eos> But I can't be with you in my city.

I'm going there with my wife this year.<eos> So what?<eos> And with our daughter.<eos> Miska...<eos> I want to be with you.
We are at an inflection point.<eos> We have to make big changes to the company.<eos> We have to make it quickly.<eos> And I am getting conflicting advice from my people.<eos> The kind of things that I bounce off you and it all makes sense.
I'll die off.<eos> And that's before I blew lunch with you not being a vegan.<eos> Of course I'm a vegan.<eos> Here's my problem.<eos> The shit that I do to keep most people after an internship... throwing money around, showing them a good time... none of that's gonna work on you.
Your husband's administration, Mrs. Underwood,<eos> - continues to operate in the shadows.<eos> - Tom...<eos> I understand you believe in the importance of your article.<eos> And I agreed to come here today and talk with you about it.
Cleared?<eos> Please.<eos> The White House has not had a single press briefing since the Herald ran my article.<eos> You keep saying the White House isn't speaking about this.<eos> I am sitting right here talking to you.
The Masterson story.<eos> "War, what is it good for?"<eos> Were you ever interested in investigative journalism?<eos> If you ask me, if it's not investigating, it's not journalism.<eos> Word around here is you can get anybody to talk to you.
I'm sorry.<eos> I'm a little nervous.<eos> You're sort of a legend and...<eos> articles on the president?<eos> It'd be an honor to work with you in any capacity.
But that's not your problem.<eos> Your problem is that you didn't tell me that covering for you with Mr. Success was putting my family in the crosshairs of some ex-cop gangster and some still-cop psycho looking to pay you back for taking his eye.<eos> He didn't lose the eye.<eos> They are gonna get to me sooner or later, okay?<eos> Now, you know, no matter how pissed off I am at you, and I fucking am, that I would never wanna see you get hurt...
We start in the kitchen?<eos> Well, to be fair to the entire house, I think it should be included.<eos> It's a lot of rooms.<eos> You sure you gonna be up for that?<eos> As long it's with you, I'm sure I'll rise to the occasion.
- No!<eos> Maybe.<eos> Look, he wants it and I'm not ready, and then I want to and he's not into it. I don't know.<eos> You know what, I feel really uncomfortable talking to you about this.<eos> Hey, sis, if you haven't noticed, I'm all grown up.
If your goal tonight was to make me jealous, you failed miserably.<eos> I'm fucking pissed off.<eos> - As long as fucking is in the equation.<eos> - Are you insane?<eos> You actually think I'm gonna have sex with you after the way you behaved tonight?
Paul, hey.<eos> Hey, what happened?<eos> I missed you this morning.<eos> I had an issue with the plumber.<eos> - Hey, what happened with you and Jen?
Beep.<eos> Karen, hey, it's me.<eos> Listen, call me back when you get this.<eos> I wanna...<eos> I wanna talk to you more about Paul.
She'd been drowned.<eos> You didn't send her there?<eos> She resigned yesterday morning, just after you left.<eos> I have to ask...<eos> Kent Finn, he said he was with you the night Miss Palfrey died.
- I wanna talk about it.<eos> - I don't.<eos> You're unbelievable.<eos> Five years we've been working together.<eos> That's why I'm having this conversation with you and not the AD.
Looks like someone forgot to do laundry.<eos> You wanna move it to the side for me, cowboy?<eos> It's in my way.<eos> - What?<eos> - I'm super mad at you.
You out there?<eos> Where's a fucking hammer when you need one? You hear that?<eos> She said she's ready to gut you like a shark that's eaten a toddler.<eos> If you're... if you're coming in here to have sex or whatever, you can do it, but I'm gonna be here reading Rilke out loud in German.<eos> Is there anybody else here with you?
We don't have a home!<eos> Zelda, Zelda, Zelda, hey, hey, hey, hey.<eos> We can go anywhere and do anything we want.<eos> If you want to go to Paris, we'll go to Paris.<eos> If you want to go to Cairo and ride a camel, I'll be right there with you.
Zelda, Zelda, Zelda, hey, hey, hey, hey.<eos> We can go anywhere and do anything we want.<eos> If you want to go to Paris, we'll go to Paris.<eos> If you want to go to Cairo and ride a camel, I'll be right there with you.<eos> The world is ours, and I want to see every bit of it with you... as long as we're together, because no matter where we are, we're home.

I lost it in the fight.<eos> Melissa's gonna kill us.<eos> I don't think we can ever go back there again.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That might work for you, but what about me?
Or is it something you're hunting?<eos> Something that got away?<eos> Something you let out.<eos> It must be stopped.<eos> Is he talking to you?
Alice.<eos> Apology accepted.<eos> That was you apologizing for what you did.<eos> I just... if we survive this, I hope we can be friends still.<eos> I know it may sound stupid, but that's what I'm mad at you for, not... not the cheating part.
I'm going to need you to keep tabs on my wife.<eos> - You mean, your ex-wife?<eos> -Oh, no, my current wife.<eos> I think there's a possibility that she might be involved in some indiscretions and I just want to make sure before I take any unnecessary action.<eos> - Hurry up. Your boss is going to get mad at you.
- Sounds a little far-fetched.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - Really, really?<eos> - Not that far.<eos> -To be honest with you, he doesn't seem like the murderer type, you know.
What type of something?<eos> - Ah, it's better if we talk in person.<eos> -Hmm-mm.<eos> Okay, when?<eos> - I can come to you right now, if that's okay?
He was gonna kill us, Lucas.<eos> He was gonna kill us.<eos> -Fuck!<eos> Fuck!<eos> One big fucking spiral with you, isn't it?
We got to get that puta.<eos> -Lucas.<eos> I'm sorry i lost my cool back there.<eos> That will not happen again.<eos> - I'm your lawyer and I'm your friend, but I can't go down this road with you any more.
What you did back there was fucking crazy.<eos> I'm fucking done.<eos> - What do you mean you're done?<eos> -Done. We're done.<eos> I'm not doing this with you anymore.
-I'm so sorry, babe.<eos> I don't know what I was thinking.<eos> I'm really scared.<eos> The detective said that...<eos> The killers might have mistook you for that guy.
Let me see...<eos> All good, Abda.<eos> I'll tell you something.<eos> You're a bunch of fucking lunatics.<eos> I'll never ride with you again.
I dance.<eos> Do you dance well?<eos> - I think, I dance quite well.<eos> Really?<eos> - Yes. What about you?
- One and why do you ask that?<eos> Because I feel like we should try.<eos> What?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Are you asking me to dance with you?
No, Supriya!<eos> No!<eos> No, no, Supriya!<eos> No!<eos> "In this pyre, with you"
Not ours, your family is crazy.<eos> And your brother is the biggest fool!<eos> - Hey!<eos> Lubna, leave!<eos> I'll talk to you later.
Everyone is blind.'<eos> No!<eos> I see you relaxed after a very long time.<eos> So what if I'm not with you?<eos> I'll always be around you, Rohan.
It's late, why don't you guys just stay over?<eos> Come on, Case.<eos> I got some Sponge Bobs loaded on the iPad.<eos> Bethie hasn't seen him.<eos> I ain't done with you but it's a long shot.
The only thing grosser than a jazz trio would be, like, a jazz quadrangle.<eos> This is empty, by they way.<eos> Well, there's gonna be, like, a flight of local cheeses, and... and then there's gonna be this, like, awesome Sonoma wine pairing.<eos> And you learn about wine, and...<eos> Yeah, but there'd be, like, no way I could come with you.
And please help me. Please!<eos> Please!" And I was like, "Stop talking!<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Where'd you get this number?<eos> I'll go with you if you shut up.
- That's what I said.<eos> - So different.<eos> I'm a junior associate at Silver Horn, New York's hippest branding agency.<eos> - Mm. - So, I have a real schedule now.<eos> So I'm happy to share my, um, Google Cal with you if you want to make actual plans.
And I see, now, in myself, every fucking guy who didn't care enough to push a little further.<eos> Hannah, that is what I am guilty of... not pushing hard enough to get to know Denise, to get to the heart of her story.<eos> Do you get that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Do you wanna know why I think I really wanted to meet you?
- Just...<eos> I... I want lines sometimes, Director Olatta.<eos> Other times, I don't.<eos> It just depends.<eos> Adam, you're very talented, but I cannot keep with the debating you!
- Yeah.<eos> Five, four, three, two...<eos> You came early.<eos> Hold on. Almost there.<eos> I wanna die inside the mouth of a lion with you.
And that's great.<eos> That's good.<eos> And you are strong. It's just...<eos> I don't know.<eos> Look, I wanna be in the lion's mouth with you.
And I think it would be good for your health.<eos> Oh, for my health?<eos> Okay. So, I should just bail on my recovery?<eos> - Do you think that's a good idea?<eos> - No. Hey, nice doing business with you.
I've been with you through all these phases... the music, the failed sitcom script, the communism, community board, and now you're just coasting.<eos> And I'm probably responsible.<eos> All right, you know what, Hermie?<eos> It's been a brutal fucking day.<eos> I'm not getting into this with you right now.
Huh?<eos> The audacity.<eos> What has he done with his life?<eos> He's got 20 years of wasted potential on me. 25!<eos> Okay, well, maybe that's why he's being so hard on you, because, you know, he doesn't want you to end up like him.
Hermie?<eos> Hermie?<eos> Hermie?<eos> Hey, wake up.<eos> I gotta talk to you.
- Did he really, though?<eos> - Allegedly.<eos> Is there somewhere you need to be?<eos> Nope.<eos> Here with you.
But if you need to go, that's fine, you know.<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> Don't put words in my mouth.<eos> I want to be here for... with...<eos> for you and with you, just maybe not in this exact house.
I'm bummed out, too.<eos> Um... holy shit!<eos> I can do this!<eos> - What? - I know enough of your chords.<eos> I've memorized all the lyrics, so I can back you up, Marnie!
Adam: I break things, Mira.<eos> That's what I do.<eos> It's why I avoided you for so long, 'cause I didn't wanna break you.<eos> But this, now... so perfect, it scares me a little.<eos> The only time I've ever felt perfect is when I'm with you, and you're telling me I'm perfect.
I don't want to be saying all this, Jessa, but, fuck, I have to explore it.<eos> And I can't help it if you're angry, because the fact is, my higher power, or whatever, is... is pushing me to look.<eos> And, um, I'm not sure w... what Hannah's gonna even say, but I know what I'm gonna say.<eos> I'm just gonna say, "Look, Hannah, we have a lot of history that we can't seem to erase.<eos> We can't let each other go, as much as we try, so let me raise this baby with you."
Um... And also, if you're looking for permission to make a sequel to your movie that depicts me as, like, Brooklyn's own Zelda Fitzgerald, minus the talent and the cool, funky hair, then I'm not gonna co-sign on that.<eos> Why don't you try casting someone who vaguely resembles me and has my gravitas next time, okay?<eos> And just let me know when it's safe for me to leave my house again.<eos> Han...<eos> I wanna raise your child with you.
Why don't you try casting someone who vaguely resembles me and has my gravitas next time, okay?<eos> And just let me know when it's safe for me to leave my house again.<eos> Han...<eos> I wanna raise your child with you.<eos> I miss you, and I miss being with you.
It's so crystal clear!<eos> Ooh. Okay, two sips in and I'm fully soused, if I'm keeping it real.<eos> Ray, you never drink during the day. What are you doing?<eos> - Eh. - It's good to try new things, right?<eos> Abelaide, I couldn't agree with you more.
Then I knew in my actual brain.<eos> You know, but it's...<eos> Th-there's... it's simple, there's too much history here.<eos> There's too much good stuff for us not to try.<eos> What about you and Jessa?
- It was unbelievable.<eos> - It was teamwork. Well, you led the charge, I just followed.<eos> I can't handle you saying "Led the charge"<eos> while you're sitting on a horse.<eos> It's really fun hanging out with you.
Yes.<eos> You should have sex before you leave 'cause I don't know what kind of dick's gonna be up in the boondocks.<eos> Great idea.<eos> I will call up one of the guys who would love to have sex with this.<eos> I'm sure there's plenty of quality people who would love to have sex with what you got going on.
Stop it.<eos> Stop crying.<eos> Alex, what happened to you?<eos> I don't understand any of this.<eos> This isn't about you, Regina.
See?<eos> We're gonna have so much to talk about.<eos> Let's... Why don't we say tonight?<eos> Say, 7:00 at the Temple Street Bar?<eos> I would love to have dinner with you, meet your friend.
All my life I will stay a Bindu.<eos> Uncool, unmarried.<eos> For life.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I will marry you.
dreaming about hot girls?<eos> Sorry.<eos> Ok.<eos> Bubla is a great name.<eos> I'll marry you.
Happy Diwali.<eos> Happy birthday, Abhi.<eos> Love, B.<eos> My sweet Bindu.<eos> I hope all is good with you.
He called Pa.<eos> And sent me a stupid SMS.<eos> I really liked this one.<eos> The idiot dumped me.<eos> Why do these guys agree to marry you?
So when will you be the next Indian idol?<eos> To hell With that!<eos> Film composers tell me my voice needs "special training."<eos> "Come home some time."<eos> If your time-pass girlfriend wasn't staying with you, I would.
Our love is intoxicating.<eos> You are a devil!<eos> You'll go to hell.<eos> So you like this fellow?<eos> Does he live With you?
But I felt Worse.... when I realised you were right not to.<eos> I felt...<eos> How are you?<eos> I'm good.<eos> Abhi, I really had to talk to you.
Two, or three rings?<eos> Everything was an emergency to you.<eos> There was no other code.<eos> Pa told me you were here.<eos> So finally Major will live with you?
Well, I can't have you chasing after me across centuries.<eos> Who knows where I might want to venture to next?<eos> Well, I don't have it with me.<eos> Herbert George, come on.<eos> I've played countless games of chess with you, and the one thing you cannot do is bluff.
- Who was it?<eos> - My boyfriend from the village.<eos> Well, my ex.<eos> He called and said he wanted to see me.<eos> I told him I was with you. But he kept insisting, so I saw him earlier.
To work?<eos> I need you to do me a favor.<eos> Pablo found... part of a wrapper from a condom<eos> in our bedroom.<eos> If he asks me again, I'm going to tell him that I've spoken to you and that you and Carlos used the bedroom when we weren't here.
If he asks me again, I'm going to tell him that I've spoken to you and that you and Carlos used the bedroom when we weren't here.<eos> Okay?<eos> Don't get all sanctimonious.<eos> There's a party on Saturday night. I'll be home late.<eos> Carlos, sit down. Your mother and I want to talk to you.
Please.<eos> Don't be silly.<eos> Hello, love!<eos> - Hello, Carmen.<eos> - Is Carlos with you?
- Have you seen my boyfriend?<eos> - No, but if I were him, I wouldn't leave you on your own.<eos> When will you give me a chance?<eos> I'd never get involved with you.<eos> I don't want to get involved, I want to be with you.
I swear.<eos> Go back to your friends.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I'd like you to be happy.<eos> I'm happy with you.
Do you have some money?<eos> Grandma is in room 7. Hurry back.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - Waiting for Laura.<eos> I thought she was with you.
It's true.<eos> Until a good dick appears.<eos> I think I did it to try to forget you, and so you'd forget me.<eos> Did you fuck him?<eos> Being with you was the loveliest, most romantic thing I've ever known,
Look. I did this so you'll never forget our story.<eos> I had to redo it lots of times.<eos> Did you come?<eos> Yes, I came.<eos> Sex with you is wonderful.
I won't bother you again.<eos> I can't let you go.<eos> You know something you're not supposed to know.<eos> You know I'm not dead.<eos> So we need to figure out what to do with you.
Your uncle is in the basement.<eos> Norman!<eos> He's a little freaked out.<eos> Caleb?<eos> Norman, I want to talk to you!
You're safe!<eos> - I'm getting the hostage!<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - You could have killed that guy.<eos> - What's going on with you, man?
He's Delta Force playing a terrorist!<eos> I got the hostage.<eos> Easy.<eos> We got this.<eos> Something's wrong with you, pal.
Thank you.<eos> I just...<eos> I thought you should know.<eos> Yeah. I mean, uh...<eos> I know this is very much about you, but can I just say... I'm just, like... vibrating with this news.
I'm sorry.<eos> I just... just got a little uncomfortable when you were flirting with me...<eos> What...<eos> I just wanna let you know that I'm, like, not interested in hooking up tonight.<eos> You thought that I was flirting with you?
Go fuck yourself, okay?<eos> I have a boyfriend.<eos> - Okay, I didn't know that.<eos> Obviously. - Yeah.<eos> I've spent exactly zero seconds thinking about hooking up with you.
You can't turn me in.<eos> It would have been better to kill me out on the road.<eos> Maybe you're right.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I should have taken a chance on you.
In the basement, we found some bone shards on the floor, most likely cast off when the killer drilled holes into his victims.<eos> I'm still in the process of matching the shards to each of them.<eos> Hey.<eos> Sorry to interrupt.<eos> - Can I talk to you for a minute?
Come on, Booth.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Hey, you got a sec?<eos> Yeah, what is it?<eos> Karen has an idea that she'd like to run by you.
Hey.<eos> Whoa. Hi.<eos> Dude.<eos> Hey, I'm sorry about the mess.<eos> Erika's super pissed at you.
Okay.<eos> Honestly, dude, that chick is...<eos> - Holy shit!<eos> - Fuck!<eos> I need to talk to you.
So...<eos> Relax, Gus.<eos> Jesus!<eos> You could use some weed.<eos> I'm not wasting this weed on you, though, 'cause this stuff is unreal.
Sorry, Commissioner.<eos> I think I should buy you a drink.<eos> And three beers.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So, there's something I'd like to talk to you about.
That'll save us a ton of time.<eos> How about a race?<eos> Last team to the bottom waxes all our boards tonight.<eos> You're on, fool.<eos> Cody and I are gonna smoke you.
- Stop fidgeting.<eos> - Go left. Go right.<eos> - You're doing it all wrong.<eos> - Enough with the backseat surfing, okay?<eos> My mom's gonna be so mad at you if we die.
He wasn't easy to find.<eos> All right, well, if you hear anything, just let me know.<eos> It's my job now to take care of things, okay?<eos> Sure, Booth, we'll sit and wait for that to happen.<eos> You know what, Ted, I'm not here to get into this with you right now.
It wasn't that easy for the rest of us.<eos> Look, Ted, I can't make up for not being around, okay?<eos> But I'm here now.<eos> It's too late for that.<eos> I'm done with you, like you were done with all of us.
Guilty of ethnic cleansing.<eos> That pretty much confirms it.<eos> Look, my unit was the one who killed him in the '90s.<eos> I was the one who took the shot.<eos> Too many links to you, Seeley, for this to not be about revenge.
I don't think Dr. Brennan would encourage us to analyze this killer psychologically, but it's clear to me, this person is certainly sick.<eos> And dangerous.<eos> Which means we have to find him before he finds Booth.<eos> Hey.<eos> I need to talk to you.
Hey, this has nothing to do with me.<eos> All right, you know what? You're giving me no reason but to lock you up.<eos> Please, Agent Booth.<eos> I'm the victim here.<eos> I need to talk to you.
The kids are fine.<eos> Who did this to you, Max?<eos> Two guys.<eos> We need to get him to the hospital now.<eos> I'm coming with you.
We need to get him to the hospital now.<eos> I'm coming with you.<eos> Oh, that... No, I'm fine.<eos> No arguments.<eos> I'm coming with you.
At home, worried about their grandpa.<eos> And Booth?<eos> He has what he needs to put Mark Kovac away for good.<eos> You mad at me?<eos> Why would I be mad at you?
I... I'm sorry I didn't tell you about it.<eos> No, I'm-I'm not mad.<eos> But for future reference, it's preferable to be informed of any pending medical procedures.<eos> I'll try.<eos> I was just dreaming about you.
I'm sorry, but what is this movie supposed to be?<eos> Radioactive Party Panthers from Fort Lauderdale.<eos> Thought you guys were supposed to know this stuff.<eos> We know enough, Kirby.<eos> Enough to be talking to you.
Yes.<eos> I-I used to get some of my best work done after the lab had shut down for the night.<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> There appears to be evidence of buckle fracturing on the angles of the right side ribs seven, eight and nine.<eos> I meant with you.
No.<eos> No, I wouldn't fire you.<eos> But you should know that you are too smart to waste your life doing something that your heart isn't in.<eos> I mean, you're not wrong.<eos> I like my job, but compared with you and the other interns...
Oh. Actually, uh, these are both for me.<eos> Wow. Anxious about the big move?<eos> I guess you could say that.<eos> I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm grateful for the opportunity, it's just...<eos> You haven't asked Jessica to move with you yet.
Brennan's in court, so you and I got to go look at a body.<eos> No.<eos> I'll drive.<eos> This doesn't make any sense.<eos> I don't know why Hodgins insisted I come with you.
You know, actually, now that I think about it, maybe this isn't the best place...<eos> I can't move to L.A.<eos> You... you can't.<eos> I'm sorry, that was abrupt. I just... Needed to rip off the Band-Aid?<eos> Look, it's just, my whole life is here, and, um, I'm not ready to take that next step with you, and it made me realize, I think, maybe, we should actually take a step back.
'...but the only person I can talk to about you is you.<eos> 'What we did today is without doubt... _<eos> 'I know nothing about you.<eos> _<eos> 'Sex with you is like being eaten by a wolf.
20 years ago, maybe.<eos> The students were queueing up, he used to get so embarrassed.<eos> "Still attractive".<eos> Do you think that's what they say about us?<eos> What is going on with you?
He made my skin crawl, actually.<eos> Confident little creep.<eos> Lots of, you know, primate crotch display.<eos> Well, you're the one with all the power, love, that's probably what it was about.<eos> You can screw him over, so he thought he'd do the same with you.
It's handy sometimes.<eos> Er, I'm sorry.<eos> I miscalculated.<eos> Bit near rush hour.<eos> It's really a thing with you, isn't it, public places?
Oh, good.<eos> I've never done anything like that before.<eos> You're married.<eos> So am I.<eos> Dear X, the only person I can talk to about you is you.
The twisted little fuck.<eos> You did the right thing.<eos> Just cut off communication.<eos> But log it somewhere, yeah?<eos> Any attempt to contact you, just log it,
Yeah, but not to say anything.<eos> He mentioned to me last night he was thinking of heading back.<eos> I presumed he meant at the end of the week.<eos> What did I do?<eos> Why does he find it so easy to talk to you and bloody impossible to talk to me?
I'm so sorry.<eos> You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> But if you do... I'm here.<eos> I wish I'd talked to you.
She holds the baby in the air and lets her feet burn.<eos> If it's the same experiment.<eos> I wish I could make you feel safe.<eos> I do.<eos> I feel safe here with you.
Why?<eos> Why with someone like that?<eos> He didn't seem... the way he sounds in court. He...<eos> He made me feel...<eos> - Gary wants to talk to you so much
Gary...<eos> Does she know about you and Rosa?<eos> There's nothing to tell any more, is there?<eos> So, no point.<eos> Surely it's only fair that she knows something about... what was going on with you and us?
Chef said you didn't eat dinner.<eos> I'm not hungry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> For what?<eos> I used to lie in bed next to you and listen to you breathe in and out, and I would loathe the sound.
- Robin, how can you...<eos> - Enough!<eos> This is a place of work.<eos> People are trying to work.<eos> Charlie, Quinn doesn't want to go to the Caribbean with you because she's a workaholic
Quinn, Charlie wants to take you to the Caribbean so he can propose to you.<eos> Unless he wants to kill you.<eos> Which one is it, Charlie?<eos> Do you want to murder her or you want to marry her?<eos> I want to marry you, if you want to marry me.
And you've never fought hunters, Liam.<eos> We need to stick together.<eos> I need to go.<eos> No, you're not going alone.<eos> I'll go with you.
We did it, Mike.<eos> However this plays out... I have no regrets.<eos> Michael!<eos> Well, if you're watching this, that means you're safe.<eos> I wish I could be there with you, but as you know now, I wouldn't have had much time.
Freedom has a price.<eos> I died seven years ago.<eos> Left behind a brother... a wife... a son.<eos> But the dead talk... if you listen.<eos> They're there with you... reaching out... trying to tell you something.
Lincolny-linc.<eos> All huffin' and puffin'.<eos> Don't you look at me like I'm trash.<eos> I'm clear with the government, the D.O.C. and my God.<eos> Doesn't appear to be the same with you.
Sucre, what the hell are you doing here?<eos> C-Note told me what's going on.<eos> He tell you to talk me out of it?<eos> No.<eos> I'm coming with you.
Well, I'm not gonna challenge the logic in that.<eos> Noel's dead, but Jenna's still out there.<eos> - I mean, we have to find her.<eos> - We will.<eos> But I'm not taking any chances with you.
Close by.<eos> Hi.<eos> Five minutes.<eos> You were in this world five minutes before I first held you.<eos> And I've been holding on to you ever since.
Fine.<eos> It'll say you're the boss in gold-leaf embossed, I swear.<eos> Hi, Katie.<eos> Yes, all is well.<eos> But I just need to clear up one small microscopic detail with you.
If that gets out to the police...<eos> Then we tell the police what we left out when we thought Hanna was kidnapped.<eos> Alison was tortured by this freak.<eos> He deserved way worse.<eos> I agree with you, Emily, and it might not be first-degree murder but we still kind of broke a few laws.
Call me after you've had your coffee.<eos> Alright, "Twelfth Night" paper is due on Friday.<eos> If you haven't picked a theme, please do so.<eos> It helps if you actually read the play.<eos> Can I talk to you?
So you already played the game?<eos> No, it wasn't a game back then.<eos> But I'm pretty sure that Jenna Marshall was the mastermind behind that one too.<eos> Where is the damn key?<eos> Em, if you roll the dice again, you're basically taking all of us with you.
Goodnight.<eos> It's latitude and longitude.<eos> It must lead to the mystery location.<eos> When are you going?<eos> I'll come with you.
Do you wanna talk about it?<eos> Do you wanna have a drink?<eos> Yeah... I'll take a beer if you got.<eos> That sounds really good.<eos> I'm gonna have one with you.
- No, I have no idea.<eos> I mean, it's, the timing just sucks.<eos> Rollins' case is still open, he's a detective.<eos> Believe me, anything you're gonna ask I've already thought of it a million times.<eos> I was just gonna ask if he's good to you.
Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Can you call me back, please?<eos> Sabrina just quit...<eos> Guess she tried to get a hold of you...
What does A.D. want from a computer shop?<eos> I don't know, but whatever it is I'll have to bring it to the school.<eos> _<eos> I don't even know why we're fighting about this.<eos> - I'm going with you.
Hi, Marco.<eos> The apartment's different than how I pictured it.<eos> Don't.<eos> Just say what you came here to say.<eos> Look, I didn't exactly expect a warm welcome but it's-it's hard to talk to you when you're looking at me like that.
Besides, you were the one that used a Pottery Barn candlestick as a deadly weapon.<eos> I don't know why I thought I had to protect you.<eos> You're basically the strongest woman I know.<eos> You've always protected me, Em.<eos> Ever since I met you, I knew I could count on you.
I know the police took your phone and I didn't want you to be without especially now that you're on my team.<eos> - It's not enough.<eos> - What's not enough?<eos> The phone.<eos> I wanna meet you.
You're free to go home.<eos> Hope you get a good night's sleep.<eos> - You disappointed me.<eos> - I disappointed you?<eos> I agreed to meet you, but you weren't careful.
- Hanna.<eos> I need to know.<eos> Because I don't know if you said it just to distract her...<eos> Hanna.<eos> I would marry you right this second if we could find a bear who's licensed.
No.<eos> Good.<eos> You're packed lightly.<eos> Are the rest of your things in your car?<eos> I'm not going with you.
Does she have an extra set of car keys?<eos> Keep it quiet back there.<eos> I'm trying to think.<eos> That was your first mistake, making all that noise.<eos> If you'd kept quiet, I wouldn't have checked the trunk and I would have driven straight to Spencer and the others with you in the back.
Instead of a family, it's gonna be homes and hospitals, institutions.<eos> We won't let that happen.<eos> Em... we're not gonna be able to stop it.<eos> Ali...<eos> Look, it took me so long to finally get here with you.
Do you mind?<eos> Who you waiting for?<eos> Nobody.<eos> Let's go for a little ride, then.<eos> I don't think I wanna go anywhere with you.
Mm-mm. Hanna wasn't here.<eos> Charlotte was.<eos> The night Charlotte was released?<eos> The night you called her?<eos> Why would she want to meet you here?
You son of a bitch.<eos> She knows not to hurt him.<eos> You were so obsessed with Michael that you would risk my son!<eos> Michael?<eos> You mean you.
- Took me one second to do it.<eos> - Don't do it!<eos> Listen to him.<eos> He's a very smart man.<eos> I'm talking to you, Whip.
- Yeah, I know.<eos> - Why?<eos> I don't know, she wouldn't get it.<eos> She just lives in a different world.<eos> I really like who I am when I'm with you.
Ali...<eos> - You don't have to explain yourself...<eos> - No, let me finish.<eos> Sex never meant anything to me.<eos> Okay? And things are so different with you, and...
- No, it's okay.<eos> Just sit.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> Holly? - We have a lot to talk about.<eos> I haven't been completely honest with you.
It's gonna get bad now.<eos> Now that you've been cleared.<eos> You think?<eos> _<eos> I was hoping to talk to you about that girl, Natalie.
But those are humans I know and trust.<eos> Clive has already witnessed a full-scale zombie outbreak.<eos> That's a genie that can't really be put back in a bottle.<eos> We want to know what you mean when you talk about Seattle being a zombie homeland.<eos> How can we know if we're with you when we don't even really know what we're talking about?
Oh, you didn't mind last time we mixed business with pleasure.<eos> You pay me for information, and I have quite a bit to share.<eos> As predicted, Klaus' enemies are flocking to New Orleans to celebrate.<eos> However, some are seeking allies among your witches.<eos> No doubt they want to befriend the very covens that still resent you, start conflict, undermine your power, and perhaps steal your prize trophy.
_<eos> Do not do that again.<eos> - I'm not going without a fight.<eos> - Would you relax?<eos> I'm not here to fight you.
Echo!<eos> No.<eos> - Sire...<eos> - Get out.<eos> It's always something with you, isn't it?
No, I didn't.<eos> - Sorry we couldn't pick you up.<eos> Work.<eos> Did you get settled in?<eos> So, Jack is very upset with you.
We get along great.<eos> - I could tell.<eos> She was the only one who had something to say that wasn't entirely self-serving.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Now, I'm gonna be honest with you.
You know, I... had a premonition before you came.<eos> - Really?<eos> - You were a baby.<eos> I didn't hold you enough.<eos> I didn't bond with you.
There, now.<eos> Daddy's here.<eos> Let's go back to your mama.<eos> Right, then.<eos> I should go with you, to Quinn's bunker.
Well, you look like dog shit.<eos> How did you get here?<eos> I've never watched a man die alone before, I was curious.<eos> Come on.<eos> Is M.K. with you?
And the new guy? What's his name?<eos> Chase?<eos> Oh, he's getting there.<eos> Well, he's lucky to have you.<eos> You know, we should invite him over for dinner, like Rip did for you.
No.<eos> Sir.<eos> Please.<eos> Whatever you want...<eos> I should be talking to you?
You can deal or, I don't know, security.<eos> You choose.<eos> You always wanted to deal in Vegas.<eos> - Yeah, but you hate Vegas. - I do.<eos> I'm not going with you.
I'm not going with you.<eos> No, seriously.<eos> Eddie, I got a parole officer I got to worry about. Uh...<eos> Then no. Then fuck it.<eos> I'm not going. I'll stay here with you.
Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> - Get back inside.<eos> - Take the girls with you.
Maybe you shouldn't have shot that guy.<eos> But we're a team, and no one is saying shit.<eos> - That's right.<eos> - Okay?<eos> I won't do another op with you ever.
Hey, Jimmy.<eos> We are almost done here.<eos> - Great. Can I, uh...<eos> - We're almost done.<eos> I'll be with you in a minute.
You and I aren't partners, remember?<eos> Once I take these people on, I can't just reassign them to you.<eos> Aw, c'mon. Why you getting all, like, legal on me, huh?<eos> Who cares?<eos> Look, I told every single one of them the situation... that they'd be getting me instead of you.
All right, Ghetto, reset.<eos> We're going again?<eos> Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> You got somewhere else you need to be?<eos> How 'bout you, Fishbait?
- Okay.<eos> - Early.<eos> Great meeting you, Ricky.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What am I gonna do with you?
Maybe you bury her, too.<eos> She didn't have anything to do with this.<eos> - Richard, you can't just...<eos> - Na'omi.<eos> Your whore digs with you.
Dharma, don't joke about that.<eos> Or what?<eos> You gonna take him out?<eos> Jesus.<eos> I'm just messing with you.
And it's only the beginning.<eos> How's recruiting coming?<eos> You were right about the Oregon girl. - Marissa.<eos> - She's online.<eos> Keeps asking when she can talk to you again.
- He was an unarmed American who surrendered.<eos> Just deal with it, Caulder.<eos> This is war.<eos> And we are warriors, not savages!<eos> I won't do another op with you ever.
You have to give me something.<eos> I've been out for two years.<eos> It's all changed by now.<eos> Waterboarding didn't work with me.<eos> It won't work with you.
- What's that?<eos> - It's, uh... it's something your Uncle Lincoln sent.<eos> - Here.<eos> - I don't want to go.<eos> I want to stay with you.
- I don't know. Did you?<eos> Like who shot JFK?<eos> I am trying to be serious here.<eos> No, you're doped up on painkillers and you're thinking too much.<eos> I promise this has nothing to do with you.
How are you, Sara?<eos> Kellerman?<eos> I'll leave you two be.<eos> Let me know if you need anything, sir.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - Sorry, how did I end up with you again?
- Mm-hmm. - Sorry, how did I end up with you again?<eos> You asked for the State Department's help.<eos> I wanted the State Department, not you.<eos> Yeah, you've lived so many lives, I don't know who you are.<eos> That'd be a consistent theme for you, wouldn't it, given that you were married to a man who never existed?
Do you have an address for her?<eos> We tried calling her, but no answer.<eos> Address is here.<eos> You are not going to try to find him, are you?<eos> God be with you, then.
- Korean genius, you mean.<eos> Getting over that wall is just the start.<eos> Once that happens, there are things only you can do.<eos> Back on point: you hit me.<eos> You wanted proof that I sided with you and not Ramal.
- You were right to break up with me.<eos> - Stop.<eos> You wouldn't be in this mess if it weren't for my big mouth.<eos> I made you tell me.<eos> I should have broken up with you, Oli.
Maybe it was a crime of passion, or...<eos> I said to stop talking.<eos> Oh, my God, do you think she has this room bugged?<eos> Hello?<eos> I can't make Laurel not be mad at you.
Please do...<eos> He looks better than I thought.<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What's going on with you?
You're trying to make sense out of things that don't make sense, choosing a target for your anger.<eos> - You still haven't answered my question.<eos> - You know the answer.<eos> I don't.<eos> Every bad thing that we've done starts with you.
No, no, no, you two dragged us into your Oedipal crap<eos> - and we've all been trying to clean it up!<eos> - You should've left!<eos> - I tried.<eos> - Well, you bailed on that plan because your boyfriend wouldn't run away with you.
He would want us to do this.<eos> You never knew him.<eos> You don't know what he would want.<eos> Are you mad at me?<eos> No. Why would I be mad at you?
We have to work together.<eos> Come on!<eos> - No.<eos> - Cross!<eos> I'm not working with you.
Come on, get up here!<eos> Look! Stop what you're doing and tell Kaniel Outis I will kill the girl!<eos> Take him!<eos> Come on!<eos> I'm not through with you yet!
- Delicious meal.<eos> It's just crazy to think someone can have that kind of power over your life.<eos> You're not getting emotionally involved again, are you?<eos> No, of course not.<eos> Just reminds me of that time before Dolly, when I was losing my mind, breaking up with you every other day.
Tell me how he'd, like, kill himself if I left, all this bullshit.<eos> - Was he serious?<eos> - I mean, yeah.<eos> Getting out a knife, saying he'd slit his wrists.<eos> Like, do you think that makes someone want to stay with you? When you have nothing of your own?
So?<eos> What's the rush?<eos> Work. Deadlines.<eos> Well, that sucks.<eos> I really like talking to you.
I ate souffl√©, drank scotch.<eos> I love souffl√©.<eos> Thanks for the invite.<eos> Oh, yeah, please.<eos> Jean already thinks I spend too much time talking to you.
Right, Michael, can we go through this again, please?<eos> What exactly did Karen ask you to do?<eos> She said I were to look after Shannon... and then she'd report her missing.<eos> She actually said that to you?<eos> That she'd report her missing, even though she knew she was with you?
Let 'em go and you have a chance.<eos> But they're me babies!<eos> I know, love, I know.<eos> Will you... Will...<eos> Can they not at least go and live with you, Julie?
The border is hundreds.<eos> Look, the airport might be the right choice, but I trust my instincts.<eos> They've gotten us this far.<eos> And my gut says we can still make it out through the north. Choice is yours.<eos> Look, man, I agree with you, even if I don't know you from Adam.
But got us this far.<eos> Crazy only works if it doesn't get you killed.<eos> _<eos> Andrew?<eos> Uh, Professor Hayden told us to speak with you?
I need to take a break from making decisions.<eos> Linc, airport?<eos> Airport.<eos> Hey.<eos> I got someone I want you to talk to.
You want to trust this guy?<eos> Well, if he screws with us, we'll just let Whip finish what he started.<eos> And I will kill you.<eos> I can't wait to kill him.<eos> You coldcock me, I end you.
We stay clear of CIA, any offensive action.<eos> We're surveillance only.<eos> We just want to put eyes on him.<eos> I think I can get you in as observers under interagency auspices.<eos> I knew I could count on you.
Michael?<eos> Your ex, Michael?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Wait, hold on a second, he really is alive?<eos> He contacted you just now?
I got a lot invested in you.<eos> You can't die on me now, Michael, you know?<eos> Called you Michael.<eos> The first-- first time I ever really known your name, even though I feel like... I feel like we've been brothers since we met, you know?<eos> You know, with-- with Linc here it was the first time I ever felt like an outsider with you.
Who is he?<eos> Really?<eos> He's a CIA operative, deep cover.<eos> He runs a splinter cell called 21-void.<eos> What does this have to do with you?
Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> Listen, I'll explain later.<eos> Don't bring him back here, okay?<eos> Keep him with you.
Or are you gonna get me a partner, so we get on with the business of changing the world?<eos> Done.<eos> _<eos> I need some food.<eos> I'm with you.
"But in return, you must take a life."<eos> show us what the tattoos mean even before the computers will, and all the people he'll be enlisting for the fight.<eos> You have to call this pay phone in France.<eos> Wait. Chicago?<eos> I thought I was going with you.
This is my part.<eos> We at Heart found incredible resources in The Scar... unstable minerals, morally questionable fuel alternatives, unnatural gases, and deep wells of unidentifiable glowing goo with properties far beyond the realm of modern science.<eos> - Seriously?<eos> - The world's ecological disaster was our economic windfall.<eos> And now we share with you, the newest member of Heart, the fruits of our labor.
"Patient already had markings on her arms where some form of needle has been used."<eos> There's a load of shit here, man.<eos> Christopher, I got to go.<eos> Get the hell out of there, man.<eos> I'll talk to you soon, buddy.
Heart Enterprises owns Kane Hill Hospital.<eos> What?<eos> The same people that put you on the race own the asylum where your sister is living.<eos> That's not a random connection.<eos> I think you're getting played, just like I'm getting played, and my partner and who knows how many other people by these diabolic corporate cocksuckers.
You're in control.<eos> Do you see a lot of kids my age?<eos> I specialize in adult and adolescent psychiatry.<eos> Is this confidential?<eos> The only person I'll talk to is you.
-Thank you mom.<eos> -It was nothing.<eos> -I love you.<eos> -I love you.<eos> How is it going for you?
I appreciate the gesture, but ...<eos> She is really cute, but ...<eos> Maybe I can train with her here but it does not think in the long run.<eos> My parents will not let me have her, so I do not draw me.<eos> I think she is already attached to you.
Bailey?<eos> You scared me!<eos> You should not do that.<eos> You could have hurt you.<eos> You can not be mad at me when I'm mad at you.
There has to be something.<eos> I just can't see it yet.<eos> - Just stop for a second.<eos> - Not yet.<eos> I need to talk to you.
Are you saying you regret it?<eos> Everything we've done since the Canterbury?<eos> No.<eos> Yes.<eos> But... Only because I don't get to spend more time with you.
Deal with it, all right?<eos> That's Gus Wylan.<eos> He's been undercover for a solid year.<eos> You think this guy can help?<eos> Look, he agreed to meet you, that's all I got.
I'm not convinced.<eos> Yeah, let's get you convinced.<eos> Rusty, open up!<eos> - Can I help you?<eos> - I need to talk to you again.
- It will be all right.<eos> Everything's going to be all right!<eos> JP Lindell.<eos> I work for Eddie King.<eos> Mr. King would like to have lunch with you today.
But we were basically broken up.<eos> And he was always out of town, and I would never do anything like that anymore because that's not who I am now, with SLAA, and you're nothing like...<eos> Whatever. You know what?<eos> I'm... I'm happy that I did it.<eos> Because if I was with Dustin now, then I wouldn't be here with you.
- I... I took a shit in my hand.<eos> - Okay.<eos> And then I, like... walked around the party for, like, an hour, just, like, carrying this turd in my hand and introducing it to people, like,<eos> "Hey, meet my friend Doody Garland."<eos> Yeah, I can't play this game with you.
You're a Shadowhunter, just like the rest of us.<eos> I'm getting married to Lydia.<eos> Maybe you should do what's in your heart.<eos> I am your father, Clary... And Jace's.<eos> I need to talk to you.
And I made you spaghetti?<eos> Your absolute favorite.<eos> Michael Wayland used to make me spaghetti.<eos> Just try some.<eos> You really think I want to have a meal with you?
I had no choice, Jonathan.<eos> My enemies were closing in.<eos> I sent you to a place where I knew you would be cared for.<eos> Father of the year.<eos> Look, we had ten years together, and sure... I may have been hard on you, but...
It's very new.<eos> This may surprise you, but you're new for me, too.<eos> Look, with Jace missing, it's just like...<eos> The ground has shifted, and I can't keep my balance. Just...<eos> I didn't mean to take it out on you.
And that includes me and Magnus.<eos> Together.<eos> - If Dad were here he'd understand...<eos> - Well, he's not.<eos> Alec... I don't want to fight with you.
How so?<eos> Alec told me that Robert proposed to you in Barcelona.<eos> I wanted to celebrate a joyous memory.<eos> Especially since he couldn't be here.<eos> How sweet that Alec feels comfortable sharing our personal family stories with you.
The hell you have.<eos> He learned this behavior from you.<eos> If you ever want to make things right with me, you better make them right with Jace.<eos> - What do you want?<eos> - I want to talk to you.
- Hey, I'm sorry.<eos> I feel horrible that I kept the rune from you.<eos> I... I never meant to hurt you.<eos> I know.<eos> Good, because I really need to talk to you.
It can't be.<eos> Hey...<eos> This news of a Downworld apocalypse, it's not all bad.<eos> Because now, it's clearer than ever...<eos> I want to spend every minute of every day with you.
Raphael.<eos> Isabelle...<eos> What are you doing here? Uh... I w...<eos> I wanted to apologize.<eos> It was a terrible night and I took my anger out on you.
Help me. Help me!<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Just a little tired.<eos> Nothing a good night's sleep won't fix.<eos> I can come back home with you, if you'd like...
I'll catch you later.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Jace.<eos> Wait.<eos> I'm... I'm sorry I blew up at you.
What did you hear?<eos> Nothing, absolutely nothing.<eos> Though... Though if I did, I suppose I...<eos> - I might be flattered.<eos> - I wasn't talking to you.
Who the hell are you guys?<eos> We don't have time for this.<eos> Get out of here.<eos> Save yourself.<eos> - No, what about you?
- Hold on. You're telling me that this burnout used repressed memories<eos> - to write a screenplay?<eos> - That's not all.<eos> He's writing about the Spear of Destiny.<eos> Which you had with you when you time-jumped
Hands. - Shut up.<eos> - They're up.<eos> Thank God.<eos> I don't think it's here.<eos> All right, Spec-y four-eyes. I'm starting to lose my patience with you. Where is the spear?
Of course not.<eos> Just my colleague merely frequents this establishment at this hour.<eos> Sorry, Jefferson. You should go back to the Waverider.<eos> I can handle things from here.<eos> What the hell is going on with you, man?
Even the hippie knows it.<eos> And he also knows that the only way to stop Thawne from screwing us over is for us to work together.<eos> Two former members of the League of Assassins versus a speedster.<eos> I am liking those odds.<eos> Dude, what is going on with you? What do you mean?
Two former members of the League of Assassins versus a speedster.<eos> I am liking those odds.<eos> Dude, what is going on with you? What do you mean?<eos> And don't call me dude.<eos> I've gotten used to sharing a brain with you. But, this, whatever this is. This is something new.
(car horn blaring) - Let me drive. - (car crashes)<eos> Alvarez, spread the word, Mayor James has called in the National Guard.<eos> We don't want any soldiers getting shot by mistake.<eos> Leave me alone.<eos> The hell's wrong with you?
- Iris West, will you marry me?<eos> - Yes!<eos> Dr. Brand invents the technology that traps Savitar in the Speed Force.<eos> - Good luck with that.<eos> - We don't wanna fight you.
I will be here for you.<eos> I tried to kill you.<eos> I killed H.R.<eos> And you are going to have to live with that.<eos> But we won't give up on you, okay?
Do you understand?<eos> Hey.<eos> Thanks for coming in.<eos> No problem.<eos> I wanted to talk with you, as well.
Well, it didn't look like her phone, so I told them to move.<eos> I had the situation under control.<eos> She told me that prometheus<eos> Now whether or not that is true, she was going to give us valuable intel on him.<eos> She's playing you, Oliver.
You take it, and you go.<eos> I'm not abandoning my post.<eos> Suit yourself.<eos> Would you like to explain what's going on?<eos> I'd like to talk about you for a minute.
Get them to the mainland and then come right back for us.<eos> We are not leaving you here.<eos> I need to focus, and that means getting you out of harm's way, and despite my better instincts, when this is all over, I will come back for you.<eos> When this is all over, you'll be dead.<eos> Can I talk to you for a sec?
So instead of marrying the blonde, you marry Ra's al Ghul's daughter?<eos> Uh... Nyssa talks too much.<eos> She hasn't explained your beef with Chase.<eos> My past is coming back to haunt me.<eos> Seems to be a recurring theme with you, kid.
I forgot how stubborn you could be.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Ahh. Thank you for reminding me.<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> I'm gonna take care of them, disarm the mine, and I'll catch up with you.
It's not real.<eos> Now just go be with your friends.<eos> Go on, enjoy the party.<eos> You're not mad at me anymore?<eos> Oh, honey, no, I'm not mad at you, 'cause you're my girl, right?
Don't say that.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> You just want me to work so you have a job.<eos> Hey, I could get a job without you, okay?<eos> I just prefer to have a job with you, 'cause you're cool, all right?
I heard you.<eos> I heard both of you.<eos> Honey, listen.<eos> Obviously, we love you so much.<eos> It's nothing to do with you.
Don't say, "Great," and walk out like that.<eos> - It's okay if it stings a little bit.<eos> - It doesn't sting.<eos> Really?<eos> I slept with you because I thought it would save my job, and it was a mistake.
I slept with you because I thought it would save my job, and it was a mistake.<eos> Sure.<eos> Repressed emotions are something I'm very familiar with.<eos> I deal with it all the time on my show.<eos> - I'm gonna be honest with you.
Well, she does.<eos> Her name is Patricia, and she's a pretty fuckin' big deal in young adult publishing.<eos> Are you bringing anyone?<eos> Excuse me!<eos> Great talking with you! Great!
Just interesting.<eos> It's like, I'm German, and I'm Catholic, I'm Midwestern.<eos> It's like a Neapolitan of repression.<eos> Right.<eos> Yeah, I got to say, it is, like, so refreshing to be able to talk to you this way.
Anger.<eos> Interesting.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm gonna go.<eos> I mean, it was nice chatting with you.
People change.<eos> I almost got through one day with him without a fight.<eos> But then you had to go and fucking tell him about AA and he got all pissed off.<eos> That is so fucked up, Gus!<eos> I can't even be in a car with you right now.
I know I messed up, and... I'm truly sorry.<eos> I'm sorry too.<eos> It's really not you.<eos> It's him.<eos> He was shitty to you.
Ever since Witchita ended, I need something stable in my life.<eos> - Oh, totally.<eos> I hear that. Yeah.<eos> - Yeah, so what about you?<eos> Is Mickey staying with you this whole time you've been in this dump?
All right.<eos> Where were we?<eos> Suck on my tits.<eos> I miss you so much, Mickey.<eos> I wish I was there right now fucking you.
- What the fuck are you doing under here? - Oh.<eos> I don't know, I...<eos> They put a router in the cabin, so I can get good Wi-Fi if I sit under here and don't bother anybody.<eos> Whatever, I don't care.<eos> Listen, uh, I need to talk to you.
Sorry to wake you up.<eos> Tommy told me to swing by so we could talk about the Arctic movie.<eos> Arctic movie?<eos> Yeah, and I just...<eos> I just wanted to go over some scheduling stuff with you.
Hey!<eos> Sorry, I hope I'm not interrupting dinner.<eos> No.<eos> It's okay. Everything all right?<eos> I wanted to talk to you about Callie's senior project.
So, how was school today?<eos> It was good.<eos> It was good.<eos> So, when were you gonna tell me y'all are moving in?<eos> I was gonna talk to you about that.
So, listen, um, Monte called earlier, and she thinks your senior project is incredible.<eos> Really?<eos> She called to tell you that?<eos> Yes, she did.<eos> And she also wanted me to talk to you.
I think that it sounds like you don't want to live with me, just near me.<eos> Mike, if you're getting cold feet, I need to know.<eos> - I have Isabella.<eos> - It's not that.<eos> I want to live with you and Isabella.
So, good news.<eos> The seniors backed down.<eos> They're showing their projects.<eos> So, all's well that ends well.<eos> Can I talk to you?
It's so great now that you have the guest house.<eos> I'll have to come more often.<eos> Yeah, in that case, maybe we'll convert it back to a garage.<eos> - Ha-ha, very funny. - Ha-ha-ha.<eos> Listen, I need to talk to you about something.
But I think you're gonna wanna look at that letter yourself... when you feel a little better.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I read your letter.<eos> And you have nothing to be sorry for.<eos> I'm not mad at you.
And I don't have a rich daddy to buy me the best lawyers.<eos> If I make trouble and get arrested, I'm goin' down.<eos> Just like Ty.<eos> That's it.<eos> I'd do anything for you, but I'm not gonna follow you down a rabbit hole.
And promising that if, for some reason, you fall out of love with me, or if I fall out of love with you, I'll never forget you're my best friend.<eos> Should I be worried?<eos> That you don't wanna remarry me?<eos> Honey...<eos> It's not that I don't wanna remarry you, come on.
They say on the road, there are three types of folks:<eos> hitchhikers, day trippers, and those who are in it for the long haul.<eos> I think if you have any vows, you might wanna spit 'em out now.<eos> - Uh... - Okay, I...<eos> I didn't really prepare anything, but, um... of course I would marry you again today.

Hey, everything okay with Callie?<eos> - You two still a thing?<eos> - Yeah. Why?<eos> So, are you settling in okay?<eos> Everyone's being nice to you?
That's good.<eos> I'm really happy to hear that.<eos> You're not just saving yourself.<eos> You know, you're gonna save a lot of girls.<eos> I'll go with you into the station tomorrow, talk to the team, all right?
- Oh, it was good.<eos> Callie already said she doesn't want to move in the garage.<eos> - You did?<eos> - Yeah!<eos> - I like sharing with you. - Aw.
Hello.<eos> Hi.<eos> Be careful, she likes beards.<eos> Um... I should get going if I'm gonna find this tree.<eos> Talk to you later.
- Well, some people might be trying to make Anchor Beach a private school.<eos> I don't know if it's true, but nobody knows, so just don't spread it around, okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> Jesus, can I talk to you for a sec?
Excuse me. Hey, Gray?<eos> Detective.<eos> You know Doug Harvey?<eos> You came to my house.<eos> Can I talk to you for a minute?
I had an abortion.<eos> Why didn't you tell me?<eos> Why didn't you talk to me?<eos> I'm adopted, Emma, you know that.<eos> I didn't talk to you, because the baby wasn't yours.
Just... just try and relax.<eos> I will... I will call you later.<eos> Yeah. Drew!<eos> Were you leaving?<eos> I was hoping to talk to you.
Should we move her?<eos> I mean, look what he did to... to Brandi.<eos> Let's give it 24 hours.<eos> See what happens.<eos> Hey, can I talk to you for a sec?
Look, I'm not stupid,<eos> Mariana.<eos> In fact, you're the stupid one for thinking that no one was gonna figure it out.<eos> I cannot believe that you knew about Emma, and you... you didn't tell me.<eos> - What's wrong with you?
We're looking for a U.S. general that has gone rogue.<eos> We have reason to believe he's trying to sell a nuke to Markovian terrorists.<eos> What concern is that of yours?<eos> Are you gonna help me find this man or not?<eos> After business with Leonov, just me sitting with you squares us with Gregor, yes?
Your strange friend's pronunciation is horrible.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'll tutor him later.<eos> Hey.<eos> Pleasure doing business with you, Lev.
Oleg said that you needed to tell me something.<eos> It can wait.<eos> You know, if visiting Star City's sister city is what it took to get you to bed, I would have bought you a ticket to Russia months ago.<eos> A friend of mine told me that my...<eos> My past doesn't have to be my anchor, and I think my past is what was... Stopping me from moving things forward with you.
Damien Darhk, the man behind tonight's siege of Star City, was killed by the masked vigilante known as the Green Arrow.<eos> Amateur cell phone video captured this very moment, putting an end to the chaos that has gripped the city.<eos> Before Darhk was killed, the citizens of Star City demonstrated there is strength in numbers as they fought against their attackers alongside the Green Arrow, leading Darhk's allies to retreat.<eos> Officials couldn't confirm the death toll...<eos> Oh, yo, can I talk to you for a second?
Susan asked me if I was the Green Arrow?<eos> Wait. What did you say to her?<eos> I handled it.<eos> I--I've been doing this for a little while now.<eos> Can I talk to you for a minute, please?
You and what army?<eos> This one!<eos> It's amazing the loyalty money can buy.<eos> Take them down.<eos> I'm gonna enjoy watching them take you down.
- Felicity...<eos> I'm putting the toothpaste back in the tube, ok?<eos> - And how is that going?<eos> - Well...<eos> Felicity, what's going on with you?
Yes, but where are we going to find that?<eos> I have to go.<eos> Code says you have one hour to finalize personal affairs before spross dopross...<eos> I can do that.<eos> But you must have captain with you who is not me.
- He's a politician.<eos> It's hardly the same thing.<eos> A human being that went through a very tragic accident, a very private one.<eos> Come on.<eos> This isn't you.
Chase does everything sideways, man.<eos> I doubt he has Susan someplace obvious.<eos> I don't know what's obvious anymore.<eos> Oh, no. I can't let you go out there alone.<eos> - I'm going with you.
I am not getting into a shootout with the SCPD.<eos> Copy that.<eos> I'm out.<eos> Smart move, douchebag.<eos> I wasn't talking to you.
We're your strength.<eos> You give me strength until Chase turns it into a weakness.<eos> Look what happened with Susan.<eos> I let myself get close to Susan, and in so doing, I gave Chase a way to get to me.<eos> That could happen with you, with... with Felicity... with my son.
Confess your secret, Oliver, and all this ends.<eos> I'll give you a gift, and you can walk out that door and go back home.<eos> Adrian, you're sick.<eos> And you're a hypocrite.<eos> There is nothing that I've done that compares with you.
It has to do with the fact that Chase would have planned for that just like he has planned for everything else.<eos> My only chance is... well, I have to do something that he hasn't planned for.<eos> Well, like what?<eos> Listen, Susan, I know that... W... we never got a chance to resolve things.<eos> I can't be with you.
I am asking you this as a friend.<eos> And I am telling you as friend, if you interfere with my operation, no favor exists that can repair break between you and I.<eos> You either Bratva brother or you Bratva enemy.<eos> We are in position.<eos> I'll meet you by the side entrance.
Yeah.<eos> Oh, just sit down.<eos> Are you firing me?<eos> Oh, Rene, there was a time when I would have loved to hear you ask me that, but, no, I am not firing you.<eos> I want to talk to you about...
Your connection to the Green Arrow and his team, it's a liability.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, once we get Chase, he'll see all the good Helix can do.<eos> I'm sorry, but we just can't risk it, especially not with Cayden back in the fold and Argus looking for him.<eos> I loved getting to work with you.
- Dang.<eos> - Thank you for the assist.<eos> See?<eos> Help is good.<eos> I will contact you when I'm on site.
Well, it will give us some time to talk about something, like this crazy idea that you enjoy killing.<eos> That's why you disbanded the team, isn't it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oliver, you said that I don't know the kind of man that you are.<eos> I wouldn't have fallen in love with you or wanted to marry you if I didn't know exactly the kind of man that you are.
On it.<eos> Ten will get you 20, that's exactly what this is.<eos> One thing at a time. - Go!<eos> - Hey, Thea called.<eos> She says she needs to talk to you.
Pain is not a new experience to you.<eos> Then stop wasting my time.<eos> That was my epiphany.<eos> For true retribution, I couldn't merely cause you pain.<eos> I had to wake you up, open your eyes, make you see the pain you suffer is still with you.
I have this really bad feeling.<eos> It's right in the pit of my stomach.<eos> What's it telling you?<eos> We never should've left Oliver alone.<eos> I agree with you, Felicity.
Christmas card list, what did you meet your niece once when she was a baby?<eos> Even after she got sick you couldn't be bothered to call and try to be her uncle, get to know her before she...<eos> - No.<eos> You're right.<eos> Growing up you were always there for me, you, always had my back with mom, and when everything went to shit I should've been there for you.
- All right you listen to me. If I see you within a mile of my sister I will...<eos> Hello, hello?<eos> Fucker!<eos> Wow geez you scared me.<eos> - I need to speak with you.
All we need to do is figure out what that is.<eos> - Well, it's about as good as we're gonna do.<eos> - Is she still out?<eos> - She should be, I pumped with her enough juice to put down a herd of elephants.<eos> Can I talk to you alone for a moment?
A dragon's first impulse is violence.<eos> Just as my father taught me, you were born to kill, not to take care of us.<eos> Your father is teaching you lies.<eos> And now you speak ill of the dead?<eos> When I'm done with you, you will be begging Edric, son of Walter, for mercy.
We'll find more like him.<eos> Let's face it, my throne was a hollow one.<eos> People I depended on betrayed me.<eos> I don't think I've ever made any real friends except you.<eos> And I was awful to you, and yet you came to my rescue.
We're family.<eos> Meg was right about that at least.<eos> I'll try not to fail you, too.<eos> Whom have you failed?<eos> My sister hates me, Vikings have overrun the kingdom, and I've not been entirely truthful with you.
Long story.<eos> Basically, we don't know what it is.<eos> All we know is, it has some kind of power to heal.<eos> You were dying.<eos> Nick used it on you.
It's a death grip.<eos> - You've seen this before?<eos> - Read about it.<eos> Has to do with the fear of dying and getting stuck in the underworld.<eos> They believed that if you took a pure soul with you, you could trade your way into eternal afterlife or something.
I just wish I knew what the hell we were dealing with, 'cause this piece of wood is scaring the crap out of me.<eos> Aah! Oh, crap.<eos> Those are the guys I killed.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> They'll never connect this to you.
We just put out an APB on him with a shoot-to-kill order.<eos> This is going south fast.<eos> - Where's Captain?<eos> - He's in his office.<eos> Listen, has Nick contacted you?
He said if I ever took it off, it would cause great pain to my children.<eos> I hate it, but I'm afraid to take it off without knowing how to break the spell.<eos> Even if he's dead, it could still survive.<eos> We'll find a way to break it.<eos> I need to be with you.
Even if he's dead, it could still survive.<eos> We'll find a way to break it.<eos> I need to be with you.<eos> And what about Diana?<eos> - She's with you now.
That was fun.<eos> First time I've ever seen a death grip from a dead guy.<eos> I saw these symbols on his face when I was there... and also on the cloth.<eos> Maybe there was more on that cloth than we could see.<eos> Do you still have the stick with you?
I saw these symbols on his face when I was there... and also on the cloth.<eos> Maybe there was more on that cloth than we could see.<eos> Do you still have the stick with you?<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm not sure you should be carrying it all the time.
I've said too much already.<eos> I should go talk to Max.<eos> Going somewhere?<eos> Are you going somewhere?<eos> Yeah, I'm coming with you.
And how would I explain this?<eos> Hey Mom, meet Maia, my werewolf friend who knows I turned a guy to dust and now she's kinda worried that I might hurt you,<eos> - or tell you I'm a vampire, or...<eos> - okay, look.<eos> Just let me come with you.
They never did.<eos> Then who does?<eos> Oh, I bet you'd love to get your hands on your precious Soul Sword now.<eos> Well, you're in luck.<eos> I'm gonna be sending it with you.
Is this about Clary?<eos> Because you know that... that's past tense.<eos> It's not Clary.<eos> And I like you.<eos> I like spending time with you.
You're kidding.<eos> She just transferred.<eos> Lucky her.<eos> She gets to learn from the best.<eos> I'm glad to be working on this with you.
We're just waiting on the ship.<eos> Well, what, uh... What's the hold up?<eos> Well, the engines burn like a dream.<eos> But the atmosphere systems have been an issue since day one.<eos> When you're going 100-plus years on only the air that you bring in with you, loss tolerances are stricter than normal.
But get this, the ship has one of the fusion drives that were stolen from the Bush Shipyards.<eos> We'll maintain position with the wreck and we'll await your instructions.<eos> When Fred Johnson gave you those coordinates were you expecting to find this?<eos> I don't know what I was expecting.<eos> He could be playing you.
I know you two have your differences but I don't care.<eos> We've got bigger issues to deal with.<eos> We're going back to Eros.<eos> We need your help.<eos> We're done going anywhere with you.
You wanna go flat-out, the Roci can handle it, but you gotta understand, you burn like that, at some point, we're not gonna be around to enjoy the ride.<eos> What's the limit?<eos> I don't know. Maybe 15-20Gs?<eos> We could probably handle that if we're juiced to the gills, but eventually one of those little blood vessels in your brain's gonna go pop.<eos> The Roci will stay with you on auto-pilot, long as it takes.
Stop it.<eos> Stop.<eos> You never have to apologize to me.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Just know, I want to be there with you, and help you with that sad little garden.
What do you want?<eos> I want to know where you and I stand.<eos> I would've thought that was pretty clear by now.<eos> It isn't.<eos> Now, I've been straight with you since the first time I approached you after the Donnager.
Hold on a second.<eos> Is this your messed up way of telling me you're sorry?<eos> Was it messed up?<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> You don't even know why I'm mad at you, do you?
Megan, why is this such a hot-button issue for you?<eos> Well, Brad, I love our apartment.<eos> I think it is the greatest apartment in the world.<eos> But if we don't start cracking down on these undocumented boyfriends, then pretty soon, I tell you what, we're not gonna have an apartment left.<eos> Now, Megan, I agree with you, but how would you respond to those who claim that boyfriends make the apartment stronger?
Yeah.<eos> Hey, are you sure you're comfortable here at my place?<eos> I-I know that my humble abode isn't as stylish as you're used to.<eos> I don't care.<eos> I'm fine as long as I'm with you.
They are not yours to share.<eos> Nor yours to hoard.<eos> It's a new world, Selina.<eos> There's no room in it for retrogrades.<eos> Then I will not circle with you.
Scott!<eos> I can't believe you're actually here.<eos> I've lost count of the months. Are you real?<eos> I'm real.<eos> I can marry you right now right here.
- If you'll follow me.<eos> Now...<eos> Here? Really?<eos> Gosh.<eos> From Mama's wedding dress. Something borrowed, so you can have one Sayre with you.
I'm glad you called.<eos> I know I probably shouldn't be, but I can't help what I feel.<eos> I like that you want me.<eos> She didn't say that.<eos> I like hanging with you.
Max told me you're doing some piece on music in New York or some other fucking bullshit that sounds made up.<eos> Why can't you just admit you wanna see me?<eos> That's what she does, she bails on you. Even when you need her.<eos> You're making this really easy for me.<eos> I actually came here to have an honest conversation with you, to tell you that I can't do this anymore.
This is an extenuating circumstance, don't you think?<eos> - Are you guys in touch?<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> She's been living with me the last few months.<eos> - Living with you?
Look, Mom and I got you flowers.<eos> Hold on one second.<eos> Jean, it's me, Allison.<eos> Please call me back. 646-555-0174.<eos> Please, I really need to talk to you.
I do know how to keep myself in check.<eos> How to catch myself... before I'm fully on the tightrope again.<eos> Jean, it's me, Allison.<eos> Please call me back, 646-555-0174.<eos> Please, I really need to talk to you.
I heard you been looking for me.<eos> Yeah, I was, but it's nothing.<eos> Don't worry...<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> See, now I want to talk to you.
I hope that's okay to say.<eos> Hey, this is Sam.<eos> Leave a message.<eos> Sam, it's Jean again.<eos> Uh, I really need to speak to you.
And then I get this.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I guess Howard's shining down on me, after all.<eos> You know, Claire...<eos> I think I've been preoccupied lately and perhaps not been present for you in the ways I want to be.
I don't know.<eos> I guess Howard's shining down on me, after all.<eos> You know, Claire...<eos> I think I've been preoccupied lately and perhaps not been present for you in the ways I want to be.<eos> So, I want to apologize if I've been hard on you.
Said they've been trying to reach her.<eos> Oh, right, yeah.<eos> She didn't mention anything about a... a speech, go figure.<eos> You okay?<eos> I was a real dick to you after Texas. - And I'm not a dick.
Yeah, I'm not the best at goodbyes.<eos> Neither am I.<eos> And look, if you want to process out of therapy, that's your choice.<eos> That's fine, of course.<eos> But... I do feel an obligation to share something with you.
But you know, for what it's worth, maybe Sidney's not as bad as we thought.<eos> I mean, she clearly cares about you a great deal.<eos> You know, sometimes... it just takes one look at someone to know that's what you really want.<eos> What the fuck are you doing here?<eos> I just really wanted to talk to you.
This is not who I want to be, Jean.<eos> Look, I can't lose you... or Dolly.<eos> It doesn't compare, nothing compares.<eos> And I promise, I'm gonna be all in.<eos> I'll commit to you entirely.
I just...<eos> I wanted to make sure i wasn't... going nuts.<eos> I mean, I know you just picked up the camera again.<eos> That must be dredging up a lot of these bad memories.<eos> But you don't need to go digging this stuff up and carrying that around with you.
Can we go home now?<eos> Claire?<eos> How are you?<eos> Listen, i know this is probably an inopportune time, but we're gonna need to get your statement.<eos> Do you want me to go with you?
Well, me neither.<eos> I talked to Ben.<eos> I know you never dropped off the photos.<eos> The photos.<eos> I've been wanting to talk to you about the photos.
- And AIDS, yes. - We must never forget AIDS.<eos> - Certainly not.<eos> A very special thank you to our very special guest, President Selina Meyer.<eos> - He's a great guy.<eos> - Oh. Back to you, Jane.
But since your failure as a leader is a virtual certainty, tolerating your short reign as CEO in exchange for a front-row seat to the disaster seems fair.<eos> Plus, if I'm wrong, which I'm not... I get rich. So I'm down with it, Dinesh.<eos> Jared, what do you think about this?<eos> I think this is crazy.<eos> I left my job at Hooli to... to come work with you, Richard.
Guests first.<eos> Oh, no, I couldn't.<eos> You don't have enough.<eos> My mother always told me to be kind to strangers.<eos> Strangers will be kind to you.
Do I have your support?<eos> You have mine.<eos> Dorne is with you, Your Grace.<eos> Thank you all.<eos> Lady Olenna, may I speak with you alone?
You know, I figured she was a knight 'cause she had armor on.<eos> She was looking for your sister, but I told her about you.<eos> Did she ever find you?<eos> She found me.<eos> What happened to you, Arry?
We live in the same town that I grew up in, in my dead grandma's shitty house.<eos> You have a shitty job.<eos> I have a shitty job.<eos> And I want more.<eos> I would be happy living in a cardboard box under a freeway as long as I was with you.
Full-color pinup to film legend to murdered.<eos> Oh, don't believe what they say about an accidental overdose.<eos> Last thing I saw from the floor of my Brentwood bungalow was a CIA spook jabbing a needle into my eyeball, lest I tell Kennedy tales unwanted.<eos> Isn't that delicious?<eos> Oh. We have no business with you.
Oh, I'm a fine me.<eos> I just keep getting better every year.<eos> Of course you are, and that is the you that deserves to be seen incorporated.<eos> Everyone in the world gets their place.<eos> With you?
You are pretending you cannot believe in impossible things.<eos> Are you still my puppy?<eos> No.<eos> If all of this is real, and TVs talk and hammers bleed, and if there's a world under a world...<eos> We have no business with you.
- A man of the mounds. - Oh.<eos> Or rather, that I was.<eos> But now I'm here, in this new world, where nobody puts out ale or milk for an honest fellow.<eos> Or a loaf of bread come harvest time.<eos> If you are who I think you are, I have no quarrel with you.
Or rather, that I was.<eos> But now I'm here, in this new world, where nobody puts out ale or milk for an honest fellow.<eos> Or a loaf of bread come harvest time.<eos> If you are who I think you are, I have no quarrel with you.<eos> Nor I with you.
Jakie, Jakie.<eos> All your friends have either died or betrayed you.<eos> The building's completely surrounded.<eos> I'd say that was checkmate, mate.<eos> I've got no problem with you.
I've got no problem with you.<eos> Lay down your weapon now and you can live.<eos> I'll let you walk right out of here.<eos> You can see your daughter again.<eos> This little business has got nothing to do with you.
What the hell was that?<eos> You wanted Dove to talk, so now he'll talk.<eos> - You shouldn't have done that. - Really?<eos> Did I not just see Harvey punch him in the face?<eos> What about you?
Nah.<eos> You had your chance to kill me.<eos> Stop turning us against each other.<eos> We're taking him with us.<eos> Oh, if you think I am going anywhere with you...
He was a sort of guide to me on my journey.<eos> You see, I know who I am, Professor.<eos> It's how to... be him... that is eluding me.<eos> I seek guidance.<eos> I feel your every move, I know your every thought, I'm with you from birth, and I'll see you when you rot.
Three answers.<eos> Those are the rules, Ed.<eos> Okay.<eos> Final riddle.<eos> I feel your every move, I know your every thought, I'm with you from birth, and I'll see you rot.
I don't even know what the weapon is.<eos> But that's exactly what I'm going to find out.<eos> - I can help. - No.<eos> The Court knows<eos> I reached out to you, but that's all.
What?<eos> You want me to beg?<eos> Is that it?<eos> I want you to be nice to me.<eos> Nice to you?
I just want to know.<eos> The number is immaterial.<eos> What matters is that Gotham must fall.<eos> And because of your sacrifice, it will.<eos> Can we count on you?
But I gave the GCPD every chance to save you.<eos> But they're no match for me!<eos> We're both dead men.<eos> You don't get it, do you?<eos> The Court isn't gonna bargain with you.
What's the blast radius on that thing?<eos> Am I good here?<eos> Or should I... duck behind a desk?<eos> I want the answer, Jim!<eos> I kill him, I still walk out of here with you as my hostage.
You know why, Jim.<eos> You blame yourself over what happened to Mario?<eos> You didn't shoot him, you didn't infect him.<eos> Wasn't your fault.<eos> I'd have to disagree with you on that one.
Let me drive.<eos> Alvarez, spread the word, Mayor James has called in the National Guard.<eos> We don't want any soldiers getting shot by mistake.<eos> Leave me alone.<eos> The hell's wrong with you?
Look... what I don't love is you not talking to me about these nightmares.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I mean, I've seen a lot of terrible things in my life.<eos> The nightmares, they're just a part of me.<eos> Yeah, but, Barry, I have been with you through all those terrible things.
Why don't you come join us at S.T.A.R. Labs?<eos> You can help Team Flash fight meta-humans.<eos> - You're being serious?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Barry and the team, they'd be thrilled to have you.
You know, he's just been looking forward to this for a long time; He's enjoying the moment.<eos> Well, I'm glad you have his back.<eos> We have each other's back.<eos> It's actually been really nice having him out there.<eos> Hey, I meant to ask you.
There's not.<eos> You can't hire a lawyer?<eos> Appeal the case?<eos> There's nothing I can do, B.A.!<eos> I don't mean to snap at you.
What are you doing?<eos> I'm challenging her to trial by combat.<eos> No, no, he isn't.<eos> Okay, I am.<eos> I'm gonna fight you.
- It's good to see you.<eos> - Good to see you too.<eos> So... what's up?<eos> How can I help you?<eos> Can I talk to you for a second over here?
Yeah, which you almost got shot for.<eos> God.<eos> What?<eos> Iris.<eos> What is going on with you?
God.<eos> What?<eos> Iris.<eos> What is going on with you?<eos> Joe, I'm sorry... Can I talk to you for a second?
You're right about that!<eos> I'm fine as hell.<eos> There he is.<eos> Didn't think you'd show.<eos> I wouldn't miss an evening with you, even if it is for a showdown.
You and I resonate on a similar frequency.<eos> I can feel it.<eos> Yet you allow your fear and insecurity to hold you back.<eos> That's why you're gonna lose.<eos> Does this look like holding back to you?
This might just be a quicker process if I did it alone.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> The gradation is darker on the palm of his hand from the point of contact.<eos> I see, I see.<eos> You know, I used to think Barry was overreacting when he complained about sharing a lab with you.
No, but... I'm going either way.<eos> Harry's my friend.<eos> I'm not gonna just abandon him.<eos> I'm going back to Earth-2.<eos> And I suppose you'll want somebody to come with you who's gonna open those breaches for you?
Ruler of Gorilla City.<eos> And now... he wants to rule the humans.<eos> He will bring war to your Earth.<eos> - Why? - He has seen many conflicts between gorillas and humans.<eos> He is afraid the humans will attack, but now that you're here, he will bring the fight to you.
My brethren have seen you.<eos> Your fate is sealed.<eos> You will all die by my hand... in the arena... so that all will know that Solovar's justice is wise and swift.<eos> All right, I'll make you a deal.<eos> I'll fight you in the arena... just me.
I know it now.<eos> How do you do that?<eos> Do what?<eos> Stay positive in the face of overwhelming odds.<eos> Because I plan on living a long life with you, and nothing's gonna take that away from me.
I did make breakfast.<eos> We got pancakes and waffles, some French toast, bacon and sausage, perfectly cooked.<eos> And I picked up some of that dark roast that you love so much.<eos> Barry Allen, what has gotten into you?<eos> Being with you makes me want to do things like this.
It was a really big win for the team, beating Grodd.<eos> I mean, we stopped a gorilla attack from happening.<eos> Yeah, look at you, changing the future.<eos> We're all changing the future, one headline at a time.<eos> Look, I don't know what the future's gonna bring, but I hope every day is with you.
Breach is taken care of.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Risky move coming to an Earth where interdimensional travel is punishable by death.<eos> Especially when I'm the one who's supposed to uphold that law.<eos> I need to talk to you.
No.<eos> Think I'm done with that.<eos> - Good. - I'll see you at home.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey, I'll walk out with you.
What about what you're not telling everyone, Barry?<eos> - What are you...<eos> - Cisco vibed me... into the future.<eos> I saw what happened.<eos> Tell my sister why you asked her to marry you.
- No, Barry, that's not it.<eos> I just want you to listen. Okay?<eos> I need you to... let me say what I need to say.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm not angry... at you.
And this is something I have to do alone, okay?<eos> Fine.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Okay, let's go to work.<eos> Can I talk to you?
Yeah?<eos> Is this really you, or is this... just another Speed Force test?<eos> Yeah, kid, it's really me.<eos> How?<eos> As soon as the team lost contact with you,
Wait, what?<eos> You're going back to Earth-2 already?<eos> - Earth-3, actually.<eos> - But you just got here, Jesse.<eos> I know, I know, and I want to be with you.
It just... it made me question if you were asking me for the right reasons, you know?<eos> If it was out of love or... responsibility.<eos> But, look, while you were gone, I realized something.<eos> I don't have to doubt why you wanna marry me.<eos> It's the same reason that I wanna marry you.
Let's do something.<eos> - Let's go out.<eos> - No, man, I'm sorry.<eos> I... I don't feel like going out.<eos> What is it with you and musicals these days anyhow?
- Lend me a hand?<eos> - Stupid.<eos> I know that look.<eos> What is going on inside that head of yours?<eos> This guy knew what was going on with you and me and Savitar.
No, we cannot.<eos> Then what are we supposed to do?<eos> I don't know.<eos> What is it with you and this guy?<eos> It's like you're hell-bent on taking him back with you.
What... what about everybody else?<eos> Julian, Wally?<eos> Joe?<eos> It's been a while, gentlemen.<eos> Especially you, Flash.
Thank you for not making a big deal about me wearing this.<eos> Cecile Horton...<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you with all my heart.<eos> And I'm sorry that I was dishonest with you.
- Yeah?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Really?<eos> I don't know, it's just... it's really nice to see you smiling so much.<eos> I mean... how could I not, knowing I'm gonna be with you for the rest of my life?
And you came to live with us.<eos> My dad brought you inside, and... you were in shock...<eos> And later that night, a sound woke me, and I crawled out of my bed, and I realized that the sound was coming from downstairs.<eos> I peered over the banister, and... I found you crying alone.<eos> I knew I had to go to you.
Now we can all focus our attention on... stopping Savitar.<eos> Good luck with that.<eos> Please tell me we're not gonna just let her walk out of here.<eos> - Now you want to fight?<eos> - We don't want to fight you.
She's gone?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Maybe too far gone now.<eos> We'll figure out a way to get her back.<eos> Just like we figured out how to get you back.
- I did?<eos> - Oh, yeah, I did.<eos> - Oh, yeah, you did.<eos> Here you are.<eos> Yeah. And with you here, I understand... my purpose.
Imagine: me inspiring you, and you applying that inspiration, and us changing the world together.<eos> And drinking so much coffee!<eos> Tracy Brand.<eos> Will you do me the honor... of joining Team Flash?<eos> With you?
- Barry.<eos> - That's not my name!<eos> Please!<eos> Stop, okay?<eos> I will go with you, just please, do not kill them.
This whole time I've been fighting it.<eos> I didn't wanna face the fact that one day, she'd be this far gone.<eos> Then go now.<eos> Keep her from making the biggest mistake of her life.<eos> What about you?
- Fine, I guess.<eos> - Just fine? Tangey, it's a great song.<eos> You know, they almost gave it to Katy Perry.<eos> Oh, I know, I know.<eos> It's just... It's just... I wanted to talk to you about something.
- Sorry. Hi, Tangey.<eos> Um... Hey, congrats on joining the movie.<eos> Thanks. I have to get to wardrobe actually, so...<eos> Wait.<eos> I've been wanting to talk to you.
You were right.<eos> You deserve more. But I-I was... hopin' that we can move past that and be friends again.<eos> Like how you and Jordan are friends again?<eos> We worked through our stuff and we're good. Too bad you didn't consider what that meant for me though.<eos> What does that have to do with you?
I mean, you saw her last night, obviously but in the last few hours or so?<eos> Yeah, not since this morning.<eos> That's great, by the way, the whole you and Cassie thing.<eos> It's just great.<eos> Hey, if she reaches out to you in any way can you just let her know that we're pretty worried and she should call or text us.
Rainer.<eos> 'Hey, so did you find Cas?<eos> ' 'You girls at the airport?<eos> I just landed.'<eos> Uh... Uh, yeah, she-she just came home but we can't go to Vegas with you.
When you told Paige you'd rather be friends I didn't believe a word of it.<eos> I didn't see that guy coming.<eos> Every time they put up new sets it never gets old.<eos> - Let's go to Vegas.<eos> - We can't go to Vegas with you.
Well, I mean, what don't I offer?<eos> You're just, you're not Chinese.<eos> Okay, look, Tangey, you have a stellar future.<eos> We're already lookin' into projects at Gold Brothers for you.<eos> And we cannot wait to work with you and your soundtrack for "Locked." Boom!
I've known her for a long...<eos> 'Cause she couldn't even tell me herself.<eos> You know why I think she did this?<eos> God..<eos> 'Cause I cheated on Rainer with you.
I left you a message.<eos> I told you to not come back here!<eos> - Jordan, what is goin' on?<eos> - You need to leave.<eos> I need to talk to you.
Rachel.<eos> What the hell are you doing here?<eos> Look, this is my yoga class.<eos> Find another one.<eos> Relax, as much as I enjoy getting a workout with you.
It's in my blood.<eos> - You know that.<eos> - What?<eos> My dad was a stunt man.<eos> He worked in that movie with you and my mom.
- Hit up.<eos> There you go.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Okay, there you go.<eos> Can I, uh, talk to you for a minute?
That's why I turned you down.<eos> And if I don't get to, you know, take private fancy jets to amazing, weird places, then cool, whatever.<eos> I don't care.<eos> If you don't understand that you've just proven my point.<eos> This is exactly why I didn't wanna date you.
- Dammit, Rainer.<eos> - Relax, Alan.<eos> It's in my blood.<eos> My dad was a stuntman.<eos> He worked on that movie with you and my mom.
You have a lot of other emotional scenes in the movie.<eos> By the time you get to those, you'll be ready.<eos> I hope so.<eos> If not, I've got a few tricks up my sleeve.<eos> - Happy to share them with you.
- You know that!<eos> - She's still doing the music.<eos> You damn straight she is, and you will be paying through the nose for that now.<eos> We can discuss possible points on the back end, or...<eos> I'm done dealing with you, Nina.
- Brandy doesn't have that...<eos> - Then you're wasting my time.<eos> Unless you came to tell me you're assuming her debts?<eos> Will you leave my mom alone?<eos> If we're dealing with you, we won't have any issues with your mom, now, will we?
Did Mike and Orly set that meeting?<eos> Yeah, uh, it's tomorrow, but I don't think that we'll need you, it's just like production stuff, so...<eos> But I know production stuff, remember?<eos> Because I can miss my biology class.<eos> Jake, I need to talk to you about something.
- Try harder next time.<eos> - I did, but she...<eos> Just go.<eos> Now, put your phone away.<eos> I knew I could count on you.
So, when I need to dig deep and really feel something... I just stop trying to control it.<eos> I'm so sorry, Rain.<eos> Thank you for sharing that with me.<eos> You're ready?<eos> Uh, hey, Wyatt. Can I talk to you for a sec?
Loved it.<eos> - Nice job, Townsen.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> I think that was my first compliment.<eos> Nice doing business with you.
I knew I picked the right girl for the job.<eos> So, what did you find?<eos> I'm dying to know.<eos> Every email, every text Nina Devon's ever received or sent, it's all here.<eos> James Bond has nothing on you, does he?
We're not freshman anymore!<eos> - This is different.<eos> - Yeah, maybe, but.. Your job as a best friend was not to convince him to leave.<eos> Jake didn't get what he wanted here.<eos> Not with school, not with the script and not with you.
- What's going on? - Um..<eos> They're fitting the whole "Locked" cast for Jordan's movie premiere tomorrow night.<eos> Tomorrow night?<eos> So, we're not doing the "Gilmore Girls" marathon?<eos> Yeah, I-I wanted to talk to you about that because y-you see, they..
- Great double blow.<eos> - Yeah, of course.<eos> - I'm a big fan of his.<eos> - Well, he's a big fan of yours.<eos> Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg also want to sit down with you.
They're holding off being together but their attraction is growing and...<eos> New Year's Eve.<eos> They danced all night and then the clock strikes midnight, and they kiss.<eos> 'And after that, they can't keep their hands off each other' they're-they're making out at the dance hall in the taxi on the way over up the stairs, down the hall to right here.<eos> S-should I, uh, block this with you?
- Thanks.<eos> Bye.<eos> Paige..<eos> I promise you, this new life you're starting is gonna be amazing.<eos> It's just.. Where you're headed? You can't take them with you.
I want you to come to the premiere with me.<eos> I, uh, picked out this dress for you.<eos> I-I thought it would look really pretty with your eyes and we can have so much fun.<eos> We'll go somewhere after to talk and, you know, grab a milkshake...<eos> Paige, I'm not coming with you.
But I don't understand, why, why you have to move out?<eos> Because I can't keep feeling like I'm living my life in your shadow.<eos> You're not.<eos> Look, with Jake gone, it's different.<eos> You know, I, I can't just stay here feeling resentful of you, it's not fair to you.
I heard you actually trained with Manny Pacquiao?<eos> Wi-will you excuse me, please?<eos> Thanks for stopping by.<eos> Where are we going?<eos> I wanna talk to you in private.
Look, I thought about what you said.<eos> And... I believe you.<eos> I know you're not proud of that guy you used to be but, Jordan, I've known you for a long time now.<eos> And you are not that same guy anymore.<eos> I wanna be with you.
- I gotta get to wardrobe.<eos> - Hey, Paige!<eos> - Paige! Paige!<eos> Over here!<eos> - Is he staying with you?
No, he's packing as we speak.<eos> Kind of a huge step backwards to work as a PA after selling a script.<eos> - And who's fault is that?<eos> - Okay, you know what, stop.<eos> I'm trying to be nice to you you backwards country freak, but why bother?
That I never did drink, that was all a publicity stunt?<eos> - What?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I just know I'm gonna say the truth.<eos> I loved being in this movie and with you.
And I'm so grateful.<eos> I don't think I can do this.<eos> Hey, yes, you can.<eos> It'll be okay.<eos> I'm gonna be right there with you.
But, Paige. Paige, are you in fact dating Rainer Devon?<eos> 'You two looked happy in those "TMZ" photos.'<eos> 'Wait, Paige.'<eos> Don't answer that.<eos> I just wanna say, for the record I wanna be with you.
'Wait, Paige.'<eos> Don't answer that.<eos> I just wanna say, for the record I wanna be with you.<eos> And, Paige..<eos> ...I've wanted to be with you from the day I met you.
I know why you said yes.<eos> You want to spend your life with him, in spite of everything.<eos> I get it, but I can't watch you marry him.<eos> Can't watch him be happy.<eos> And it's really hard for me to say that I won't be there with you.
Damon.<eos> - Oh, God. - This is not my fault, Caroline.<eos> Impromptu weddings call for impromptu bachelor parties.<eos> Oh, please, don't be mad at me, Caroline.<eos> I'm not mad at you.
Are you actually happy?<eos> Certainly, luv.<eos> I'm imagining us next to a little church I remember in the French countryside.<eos> It's in the middle of a lavender field.<eos> I always thought it would be the perfect place to marry you.
You said it was for future me.<eos> A guy who'd one day ask for your forgiveness.<eos> Is this you asking?<eos> Let's save that for another Salvatore bonding night, why don't we?<eos> I just wanted you to know that Elena would be with you tomorrow.
Traditional opening waltz of the Founder's Ball.<eos> The exact same one you and Katherine danced to in 1864.<eos> She won't be able to resist.<eos> You girls will go in front of Mommy, and then Mommy will just walk herself down the aisle, and it will all be fine.<eos> Or I could walk with you.
You saved me from despair.<eos> You told me once that I would fall madly in love without realizing it.<eos> And that's what happened.<eos> Day by day, bit by bit, year by year.<eos> With you.
But I do know that Chloe proved herself to you.<eos> Maybe now it's your turn.<eos> Maybe now it's time that you prove yourself to her.<eos> You don't have to prove anything to me.<eos> Well, normally, I would agree with you.
See where I'm going with this?<eos> Well, look, man, the good news is... none of them has motive to be the killer.<eos> Because none of them cared enough about me to murder.<eos> Thanks for calling me in.<eos> I actually wanted to speak with you.
What'd you do to them?<eos> Nothing.<eos> They are inconsequential.<eos> You're different.<eos> He's different when he's with you.
Okay.<eos> Any sign of Burt?<eos> Not yet, but I'll stick around until someone approaches.<eos> What?<eos> I think I just figured out what's wrong with you.
Dan slept with Charlotte?<eos> Trust me, you're not half as disgusted by that as I am.<eos> Is there anyone who hasn't slept with that woman?<eos> Uh... Which is hard to believe since you've slept with everyone else in L.A.<eos> Well, everyone except you, Detective.
I'd love one for Lux.<eos> I'm not sure where I'd put it...<eos> I want my package.<eos> Now.<eos> I should've known Jana left it with you after I saw her at Lux.
I spilled a little on myself.<eos> What the hell is happening to me?<eos> So what if you slept with Charlotte Richards?<eos> You slept with my...<eos> He's different when he's with you.
Well, who's to say the killer wouldn't demand her other hand?<eos> Her spleen?<eos> Her heart?<eos> 'Cause, believe me, there is no winning when you play by a twisted tyrant's rules.<eos> Excuse me. Can I talk to you for a second?
So... none of it was...<eos> None of it was real.<eos> Don't!<eos> Lucifer.<eos> Detective, I need to talk to you.
I've been looking all over for you.<eos> Amenadiel.<eos> Give us a minute.<eos> I... have an idea.<eos> I need to talk to you.
- right now, man, it's my wife...<eos> - Ex-wife.<eos> My ex-wife's life is on the line.<eos> You... so you're trying to help your ex-wife?<eos> Something's wrong with you, buddy.
This is a terrible idea.<eos> I absolutely forbid it.<eos> I hate to agree with Her Highness, but she's right.<eos> You'd be on your own.<eos> We both know I can't go down with you.
- will cannibalize attention from both. - Man.<eos> - Excuse me, Byron.<eos> - No, man.<eos> Shut your dumb ass up.<eos> Dad, I agreed to do a song with you, now you're pulling my album?
Look, I know I give you flak a lot.<eos> But you made of steel, girl.<eos> You got this.<eos> Okay, Thirsty, but you gonna have to Mr. Miyagi my ass through this.<eos> Okay, okay, we got you now.
Oh. Good old reliable angel radio.<eos> He was begging for help and then he just stopped.<eos> I need to know if he's still alive.<eos> Yeah, all right.<eos> Well... we'll come with you.
I thought he was perfect.<eos> But he is a monster.<eos> Ishim, what have you done?<eos> What have you done?<eos> I shared all of our secrets with you, taught you all of our ways for your precious studies.
Uh, maybe wish you hadn't had done that just yet.<eos> Wait, why?<eos> This Lily chick?<eos> Says that her daughter was human.<eos> I think Ishim... I think he's playing you.
A lot.<eos> You can't run forever.<eos> You're trapped out here.<eos> Well, what we have here is a failure to communicate.<eos> 'Cause we're not trapped out here with you.
At 10:45, demon comes home.<eos> Sam and I will be waiting for him.<eos> I'll pop him with a devil's trap bullet.<eos> I'll finish him off with a demon blade.<eos> And I will wait at the back with you in case he comes in that way.
"O restless spirit, make thy presence known to me."<eos> Fiona?<eos> It is I, Gavin.<eos> Your Gavin.<eos> I must speak with you.
No. Ugh.<eos> What'd you get up to?<eos> I read through more of Mick's lore books.<eos> Really?<eos> Wow. Those three stars are wasted on you.
Not really.<eos> Guy stroked out a couple years ago.<eos> Breathes through a tube.<eos> Guess who gets to take care of him?<eos> Can you imagine having to spoon-feed the guy that wailed on you for all those years?
Um, I'll text you the info, but, uh... I know the Brits have got you running nonstop.<eos> So if you can help out, that'd be great.<eos> Um... And even if you can't swing by, can you call me back?<eos> Just some stuff going down that's...<eos> Be good to talk to you.
Is that a grenade launcher?<eos> Yes, she is.<eos> Yeah, but, uh, this is what we need right now.<eos> Witch killing bullets.<eos> And what about you?
It's only when you grow up that you realize that they're just people.<eos> Love your brother?<eos> And even if you can't swing by, can you call me back?<eos> Just some stuff going down that's... Kind of got me spun out.<eos> Be good to talk to you.
Nice try.<eos> If you kill me, well, then all of them just fall apart.<eos> So here's the offer.<eos> You take my power.<eos> You take my burden, and my doll... your mother... Will stay with you and your sister forever.
Because I'd like to speak to her, that's why.<eos> No, I'm not being terse.<eos> Look, if you haven't seen her, do you know where she is?<eos> No, I'm not being curt either.<eos> Look, I don't have time for manners 101 from you, okay?
No, I'm not being terse.<eos> Look, if you haven't seen her, do you know where she is?<eos> No, I'm not being curt either.<eos> Look, I don't have time for manners 101 from you, okay?<eos> If she's with you, I wanna know about it.
Your relationship with the Winchesters.<eos> It's a bit cozy for my taste.<eos> I hope you don't expect me to spare your friends.<eos> That completes my examination.<eos> Okay, Drexel, as much as I enjoy playing doctor with you day after day, I need to blow this joint now.
I killed somebody.<eos> He was a-a friend.<eos> I do it all the time.<eos> I believed in what you people were doing.<eos> I fought with you so that my boys could maybe live in a world without monsters.
Yeah.<eos> I saw you.<eos> You're ready for this.<eos> You show those sons of bitches who's boss.<eos> What about you?
Aah!<eos> Oh, what? Thought you'd get your Mum back?<eos> Sorry, Dean.<eos> Not how this ends.<eos> This ends with me ending you.
It's not okay.<eos> Since I've been back, I know... I've been distant.<eos> Cold, even.<eos> Leaving you, working with them... I was trying to make things right.<eos> Just from a distance, because... being here with you was too hard.
And they'll all be starting to talk amongst themselves and speculating.<eos> Here you go. All right?<eos> _<eos> Maggie, sorry to keep you waiting.<eos> Three weeks I've had to wait to get an appointment with you.
How are you feeling about doing it?<eos> I do wanna talk to them, I... I just don't know if I'm ready.<eos> You do what's right for you.<eos> Don't worry about what anyone else says.<eos> I can come with you to the interview, if that's helpful.
You see, now I'm thinking, what else isn't Trish telling us?<eos> - Hello, you.<eos> - Hiya, Dad.<eos> I wasn't expecting to see you tonight.<eos> I need to talk to you about something.
- Yeah.<eos> It was our first big outside do.<eos> Cath comes in here a lot.<eos> She asked if we fancied doing the food.<eos> And how many people did you take with you?
Every man who was at that party.<eos> Right.<eos> Pasta.<eos> Again.<eos> What's up with you?
Is your dad in?<eos> No, sorry.<eos> Good.<eos> Cos it's you I want to see.<eos> I tried to talk to you earlier, at the football, but there were too many people around.
Why would they be judging me?<eos> Well, no.<eos> That's what I'm saying.<eos> They're not judging you.<eos> You know, we're all here for you.
Well, no.<eos> That's what I'm saying.<eos> They're not judging you.<eos> You know, we're all here for you.<eos> Cath, I-I need to talk to you about something.
She's not religious and didn't know how much help it would be.<eos> But you did say it didn't have to be about that?<eos> It's support.<eos> I did, I really talked to her about it.<eos> She's not up for seeing you.
I feel like I'm sinking, Beth.<eos> It's not a straight road.<eos> Some days will be harder than others.<eos> You're strong, Trish.<eos> I'm so impressed with you.
I understand.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> Really?<eos> You understand how you might have screwed this investigation?<eos> If we find out Trish's attacker has any connection to you, this will never stand up in court!
- Are we due to meet?<eos> - No.<eos> I got a call from the police.<eos> They're going to be making an announcement.<eos> I wanted to talk to you about it first.
You chose not to be a client of ours.<eos> - I'm just a woman who's angry.<eos> - With me?<eos> With the man who did this to you.<eos> But, yeah, with you, a little bit.
Not through my house.<eos> Back way.<eos> Slink out, like your husband did.<eos> Go on.<eos> Mum, I need to talk to you.
And my life since then has been so empty.<eos> There's this... chasm...<eos> where you used to be.<eos> I just wanted to see you.<eos> Be with you.
So, yeah, there's a connection.<eos> - Hello, Danielle. Is Leo here?<eos> - No, he's not.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Cos we went to his house and his dad said he was here with you.
200 spears.<eos> In return I shall require the head of Osbert.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Guthred showed clemency, but still betrayed me.<eos> You will become a slave, Uhtred, and Halig with you.
When you go to Eoferwic... will you kill my brother?<eos> Are you asking if I will, or are you telling me to do it?<eos> The first one.<eos> I have sworn to Alfred that Guthred will not be harmed.<eos> I want to go with you.
She's gathering my men... whatever is left of them.<eos> You will meet them where?<eos> Loidis.<eos> I'd ask you to come with me, but I hear you've been making more of your oaths.<eos> I will be with you.
No, we go in as agreed, together.<eos> We cannot risk the both of us being killed.<eos> Yes, we can.<eos> This is for Alfred, you must save your sword for Kjartan.<eos> If it is for Alfred... I will go with you.
Maybe it's not who you are.<eos> - Honey.<eos> - Is there a problem?<eos> Oh, God, not you.<eos> Look, Joel, obviously you're upset, but if Sheila doesn't wanna go with you...
I rang the bell then I saw your car in the driveway, so...<eos> I'm just gardening. It relaxes me.<eos> What's up?<eos> I just wanted to make sure you were all right.<eos> Because I didn't wanna have sex with you last night?
What?<eos> Hey. Hey, come on, Red.<eos> You never give up.<eos> You're like that bunny that keeps on going and going 'cause Meth-Head Charlie fed him Adderall.<eos> And to be honest with you, I was kind of counting on you to-- to see a double rainbow or make friends with a carriage horse, and then I would snap out of my Artie funk and I would run to the airport, all romantic,
God, I loved him.<eos> And all those bloody stupid sessions, pretending to change.<eos> When all I wanted him to do... was hold me.<eos> He followed you out of the club, didn't he?<eos> He wanted to talk to you.
I'm fine, I'm going home, I'm not getting involved.<eos> You knew who she was before I worked it out.<eos> You knew, and you didn't say, did you?<eos> Oh, my God, I can't believe it. We're back here again!<eos> You doing stuff you shouldn't be, and me having to cover it up.
Frankie, how could you not tell me about this?<eos> Grace, I am a private person.<eos> You are the least private person in the world!<eos> First time I met you, you pulled up your shirt and said, "Do these things look right?"<eos> Look, I haven't had time to tell you because my whole life has been working with you and sleeping with Jacob.
Oh, Barry's here.<eos> You can send him right in and then get out.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey.<eos> So, Sharon from HR is insisting I do this, uh, exit interview with you.
Sol, I don't know if I ever want to go back to work again.<eos> What?<eos> It's no fun anymore.<eos> Do you remember when it was fun?<eos> It's fun being with you.
I've thought about it.<eos> And?<eos> - I'm not sure I'm ready. - Hm.<eos> Is this really what you want?<eos> All I want is to be in this house dancing in two different rooms with you.
Curtis is the go-to guy for all matters Senate, and Jamie for the House.<eos> Denise handles military and cabinet.<eos> Aaron...<eos> Good luck.<eos> You sure you don't want me in there with you?
I got to find out if this is bullshit or if it's real.<eos> If it is real, - I have to make some moves before we...<eos> - I know.<eos> We prepared for this.<eos> But I'm not running with you. And neither are the kids.
Without it, no steak.<eos> I am quite capable of convicting Axelrod with the tools at my disposal.<eos> I no longer need you.<eos> I have not made this sacrifice to come up empty.<eos> If you won't let me get waist deep in the Big Muddy with you, then I'm gonna want something for my trouble.
Did he off himself?<eos> That is dark.<eos> No. I just heard from a contact at the Bureau of Prisons. He's been released.<eos> What the fuck is that about?<eos> I thought I made it pretty clear I never wanted to talk to you again.
Break it down for me.<eos> I'd rather walk him through it in person.<eos> That way, it won't be diluted or misstated in any way.<eos> No, you're right. Fine.<eos> Axe will reach out to meet with you if and when he's ready.
If you don't see that, I really have failed.<eos> Dad...<eos> Just so you know... I'll always be your father, you'll always be my son.<eos> You will stand up at my funeral and say meaningful things about me.<eos> But until then... I am done with you.
- Not at all.<eos> I wouldn't have it any other way.<eos> Hell.<eos> Things are so...<eos> It's probably better that she stays with you.
Things are so...<eos> It's probably better that she stays with you.<eos> Why?<eos> Eleanor.<eos> What's going on with you?
So was Gunn.<eos> The Taferos... We took them all off the chart, Jerry.<eos> They'll never hurt anybody again.<eos> But not like that, brother, not like that.<eos> What has happened to you?
And sometimes it seems like you want them to succeed.<eos> Maine state law requires sexual education.<eos> But local boards decide which topics.<eos> And the topics they don't want covered, do we imagine they just disappear if we ignore them?<eos> I may personally agree with you, but when you teach topics that aren't covered by the board, you're telling them about stuff that we've decided they're too young to know about.
Eve, it was a party.<eos> There's no way I could have known... but I could, which is why I said no.<eos> How could you have known?<eos> Because I've spent my entire life around guys like Jay.<eos> I can't be with you right now, okay?
You wore me out.<eos> Can't take it to my lieutenant.<eos> She thinks this guy walks on water.<eos> Look, Santiago.<eos> Now, if you stir this shit, nobody will ever want to work with you again, ever.
-Do you think I like living like this?<eos> Can't you see that I'm trying, Ava?<eos> I'm doing the best that I can.<eos> -It's not my fault you screwed up your own life and it doesn't mean you get to relive it through me.<eos> -It never ends with you, does it?
Oh, I'm sorry, here, um... let me clean this up.<eos> Do you want any of this?<eos> -No, I...<eos> I'm good. -Oh, OK.<eos> -Hey, need to talk to you about last night.
-OK, Yeah, bye.<eos> (thinking) I don't know how long I can keep this up.<eos> -Finally!<eos> -Hey, Ava!<eos> Come on, babe, get in the car, I want to talk to you!
-You know, I... don't really want to discuss this.<eos> -Look, I said I was sorry, what more do you want from me?<eos> -I want you to keep on driving.<eos> -You can't get rid of me that easily.<eos> -Look, let me put this blunt to you, guy.
-I don't have time for this.<eos> -You literally just told me you love me and now you're blowing me off?<eos> What's gong on with you?<eos> Ever since that party you've been acting weird.<eos> -Then move on, good talking to you.
- I do miss the screams, though.<eos> Just not the same without them.<eos> There they are!<eos> You see how simple that was?<eos> Well, it was nice working with you, my dear, but your services are no longer needed.
Isn't this what you want? To get back what she stole from you?<eos> -She didn't steal it.<eos> I threw it away.<eos> -Do you know what this is?<eos> It will work on you just as well as Skinners.
I was gonna tell you.<eos> When do we come first?<eos> Come on.<eos> You know you always come first.<eos> But Janelle, I cannot talk about the same shit with you over and over, it's driving me crazy.
No, I can't, I won't.<eos> I won't let that man touch my daughter.<eos> You need to shut your mouth, and you need to let me do my job!<eos> Let me tell you something, you're gonna lay your hands on my daughter over my dead body. Will.<eos> Can I speak to you outside for a minute?
One guy's a priest or something, and uh, the other one, I don't know.<eos> Oh, are they here for you?<eos> I guess so.<eos> I've been a bad girl.<eos> What's up with you and Zepata?
- Okay.<eos> - Are you afraid of me?<eos> - No, I'm not afraid of you.<eos> I think you should come to the party with me.<eos> You mean, you mean with you, with you?
Don't worry about it.<eos> So yeah, I guess, sometimes I do things, I don't know why.<eos> But, hey.<eos> Tonight, all I wanna do is have fun, can we do that?<eos> Yeah, I can have fun with you.
Stop.<eos> I can see you.<eos> Oh, great.<eos> Deputy Dumb-ass.<eos> I need to talk to you.
And thank you for letting me and dad stay here.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> It's a dream come true having you stationed here in my home base.<eos> You want some?<eos> Well, we're indebted to you, dad.
We were walking across the grass, and it was just lying there.<eos> So we picked it up and we brought it in school, and that's when you found us.<eos> You expect me to believe this bottle doesn't belong to you?<eos> This is the third time, Savanah, and you know suspension is the next step.<eos> I've tried to go easy on you because of the loss of your father.
He did die.<eos> I sense him, dusty.<eos> Every day I feel his presence, and I can tell that he's sad because his wishes weren't honored and because my mom and I are struggling.<eos> You would do it if you were in my shoes. You know you would.<eos> Are you asking me to break in there with you?
I do know... He has a plan for all of us, but I don't know what that plan is.<eos> That's why we have to have faith in his wisdom.<eos> This is not my first rodeo with god.<eos> Don't give up on him, dusty.<eos> Don't give up on him, and I promise he won't give up on you.
I'm not looking for another horse, okay?<eos> I know that you think that you're the only horse in the world, but you're not.<eos> Gosh.<eos> Wish me luck.<eos> Everyone's been trying to get ahold of you.
Stay in your room!<eos> Shit!<eos> No.<eos> Joe.<eos> I gotta talk to you.
Who did it?<eos> Junior Vassey or-or Dan Pleasant.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Your friends.<eos> You bring mayhem with you, Joe.
She cracks me up.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yep.<eos> Too bad I have to let her go.<eos> Oh, there you are.<eos> I, um... I need to talk to you.
She's not so thrilled with the idea of actually meeting one of my clients, however, so...<eos> So, you do what you do with other women and then you go home and watch Scandal with her?<eos> We love Scandal.<eos> We're really looking forward to next season.<eos> Look... I enjoy you.
You... but you're in a theater.<eos> Uh, yeah, surrounded by people.<eos> You're worried about what those people are gonna think?<eos> I might.<eos> Okay, let me level with you.
It just doesn't feel like I have a lot of options.<eos> If the kids were not in the picture, what would you do?<eos> I mean, don't you deserve to be with someone who makes you happy?<eos> I'd settle for someone who wants to be in the same room as me.<eos> No, wrong. You need someone who wants to be with you all the time.
I mean, don't you deserve to be with someone who makes you happy?<eos> I'd settle for someone who wants to be in the same room as me.<eos> No, wrong. You need someone who wants to be with you all the time.<eos> Who loves you even when you hate yourself.<eos> And no matter where you go or what you do, he still wants to be with you.
Right, babe?<eos> Quick scramble?<eos> Babe?<eos> Allison?<eos> Whoa. If I'd known you were as good at this as you were at stealing my husband, I would've gone into business with you.
Good. I like that.<eos> Hello, Jacob.<eos> I know. I'm so sorry.<eos> I don't think I can make it.<eos> Of course I want to talk to you about it.
Like surf and turf.<eos> Surf and turf is one experience by definition.<eos> - Not the way I eat it.<eos> - You're not answering the question.<eos> I had an amazing time with you.
- You're not answering the question.<eos> I had an amazing time with you.<eos> That was some of the best sex that we've ever had.<eos> Why don't you make that sound with me?<eos> No, it has nothing to do with you.
Well, you go off on your own, you run the risk of getting notes.<eos> Well, I guess going off on my own feels like the thing to do these days.<eos> Okay, let's unpack that last remark a little.<eos> Have you unpacked your stuff with Jacob?<eos> Well, no, I wanted to do it with you first.
If I tell you to leave, you're gonna think I don't care.<eos> If I tell you to stay, you're gonna resent me for keeping you from your boyfriend.<eos> It's a lose-lose.<eos> You're gonna have to talk to somebody else.<eos> But you're the one I want to talk to.
You have everything you need inside.<eos> - I do.<eos> - Are you kidding me?<eos> You said you didn't want to talk.<eos> But I didn't think I'd have to listen to a conversation between you and you.
I'm going to cancel my trip to Santa Fe this week.<eos> No.<eos> I don't want anybody cancelling anything for me.<eos> I don't want to be away from you.<eos> Maybe I should go with you.
I'm gonna get ahead of this.<eos> And a messenger, dropped off clothes for you.<eos> Katie, what are you doing here?<eos> Is everything all right?<eos> Well, can I just speak with you for a couple seconds in private?
Right.<eos> Bram.<eos> Will?<eos> Hey, Doc.<eos> I need to talk to you.
I know.<eos> Even if we dropped him at the Green Zone gates, best case scenario-- they'll just get him healthy enough to torture.<eos> Then he gives up you and everybody else.<eos> There's no good out here.<eos> He wants to talk to you.
Help me.<eos> I think she's drowning.<eos> So?<eos> She's dead anyway.<eos> What's wrong with you?
Dad!<eos> Thank you.<eos> I made contact with the pilot.<eos> She wants to meet you at a neutral site.<eos> Why didn't she come here with you?
Fragments started falling down.<eos> They hit our dome.<eos> Luckily, the safety blisters held, it was the only reason that we were able to get out.<eos> What happened to Mei?<eos> You were really badly hurt, the doctors had to induce a coma, and I stayed with you.
Ever since I found you, broken, looking for redemption under a Belter knife, I have tried to teach you the Belter way.<eos> I have failed.<eos> You told us that when you destroyed Protogen, the Earth corp responsible for killing so many of our brothers and sisters on Eros, that you destroyed all its secrets as well.<eos> There was nothing left for us to fear.<eos> But instead, you preserved what you could of this terrible new weapon, and took it back to Tycho with you, keeping those secrets for yourself, no doubt believing that when the time comes, as it surely must, you and you alone,
We're traveling together.<eos> Inners only.<eos> - I guess I could stay.<eos> - No, no, it's okay.<eos> I'll join you as soon as I can.
You're gonna throw that in my face?<eos> Oh, Jesus!<eos> Amos!<eos> Amos!<eos> I don't want to fight you, Alex.
Half the mirror came down on Sector 4.<eos> Mei's gone.<eos> I'm going back to Mars.<eos> We could start over together.<eos> I'll join you as soon as I can.
I was a friend of your cousin, Doris.<eos> We worked together on Ganymede.<eos> She saved my life.<eos> She got me out of the station when the mirrors fell.<eos> She was on her way back to Mars, to be with you, but...
Ooh, I found that at the back of the cupboard with all your old stuff.<eos> Just photographs of your mum.<eos> I didn't know we had 'em.<eos> Happy new term!<eos> With you in a moment.
- No, but tell me.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Yeah, cos I think you're going to wipe my memory.<eos> I'm not stupid, you know.<eos> That's the trouble with you.
- I don't know, Marty, it's just.<eos> I know when something is too good to be true.<eos> - What's your point?<eos> - My point is that there's not that many safes lying around with this kinda cash in it that aren't for something special.<eos> - What's the matter with you?
- Kid, what're you talking about?<eos> We can't put it back.<eos> - We lake the money, and buy a condo on the beach somewhere, play shuffleboard with the old ladies.<eos> Just, get outta town.<eos> - Okay, okay, I'll make you a deal.
Your bullshit cocky attitude isn't gonna work with me, Doc.<eos> - It's not about me.<eos> I don't,<eos> I don't fucking care if it's about you.<eos> Fuck your questions, fuck you.
- Is that gonna be a problem?<eos> - No, not a problem, unless you make it that way.<eos> You all didn't do nothing together, now, did you'?<eos> . Oh. Daddy.<eos> - Oh, come on, I'm just playing with you.
- Jack, oh Jack, you out there, son?<eos> Listen I got a confession to make, pal.<eos> Your wife whispered in my ear that she wants to suck my dick.<eos> You like that?<eos> I'll make you a deal.
Call for backup.<eos> - Margaret, don't bring it up again.<eos> Just tell the guys there's a ladder in the garage, or we'll rent theirs, 'cause they'll charge you rent.<eos> And have them climb up on the roof and don't tell 'em we don't have insurance.<eos> No, I'm not gonna discuss it with you now, I'll do it when I gel home.
- Tomorrow I have a date with a real doctor.<eos> You know what the worst part is?<eos> Nobody's gonna be there to see me off.<eos> Anyway-<eos> It was nice talking with you, Amanda.
You know what the worst part is?<eos> Nobody's gonna be there to see me off.<eos> Anyway-<eos> It was nice talking with you, Amanda.<eos> - You too, Jack.
And Se√±or Amarillo, Loyal to Pertain, and fought until the end of Berlin.<eos> Sant√©!<eos> This room is full of men who backed the wrong horses, indeed.<eos> I'm feeling charitable.<eos> So... I'm fulfilling my obligation to you.
That's my military passport.<eos> You can put your picture on it.<eos> - Steiner won't like th...<eos> - Forget Steiner!<eos> Take the money from tomorrow's fight. Go to America, take Isabelle with you.
Take the money from tomorrow's fight. Go to America, take Isabelle with you.<eos> You're as good as back in jail here.<eos> And you don't even know it.<eos> Go to the States, get away, taste real freedom.<eos> What about you?
You're a scum that got lucky for a day or two.<eos> I... am an aristocrat.<eos> I was a fighter once.<eos> Let's see how good you are.<eos> I have no fight with you.
- I was quite happy where I was.<eos> - Dr Powell's orders.<eos> - There you go, Mr Bright.<eos> He'll be by later to discuss your X-rays.<eos> Did they talk to you?
Rodents, according to Dr DeBryn.<eos> The specs.<eos> Rats have had a nibble, haven't they?<eos> Anyway, you haven't forgotten about tonight?<eos> Counting on you.
- Wait. Where are you going?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> I've never ditched before.<eos> Hang on.<eos> I'll come with you.
And then she woged and had some kind of seizure.<eos> - You're feeling stuff.<eos> - No.<eos> They believed that if you took a pure soul with you, you could trade your way into eternal afterlife.
Well, did they leave?<eos> Not before they checked out the shop, like, fully.<eos> What if they come back and break in?<eos> Nick, you need to get out of here.<eos> I'm going with you.
Whatever you do, we're gonna figure this out.<eos> It's Renard.<eos> Hey, Captain. How you doing?<eos> Put him on the phone.<eos> He wants to talk to you.
I'll be on the roof.<eos> Renard only has one thing he can use against you.<eos> My son.<eos> Can you get Adalind and the kids, bring them back here?<eos> - I should go with you.
She has amazing abilities, ones I don't understand, and I don't know where they came from.<eos> And Sean doesn't know either.<eos> We have to protect her.<eos> I know.<eos> I'm so happy to be back here with you.
See what happens when I don't do what I must.<eos> Kenneth Slater?<eos> He's one of the victims that was kidnapped on the case I was looking into.<eos> But he was returned alive.<eos> This has nothing to do with you.
Wow, I guess you would know, huh?<eos> - Haley...<eos> Haley...<eos> - No, no, I'm done<eos> - talking to you, Paul!
- Haley...<eos> Haley...<eos> - No, no, I'm done<eos> - talking to you, Paul!<eos> - I'm not done talking to you!
Yeah, I'm getting a little worn around the edges myself.<eos> - Coming?<eos> - I can't.<eos> Why?<eos> It's not great, me staying with you and Adalind.
Not me!<eos> Monster!<eos> You ever thought about what you want done?<eos> With what?<eos> - You.
- I know.<eos> - That's why we can't wait.<eos> We have to find this thing, and kill it.<eos> I'll get the books.<eos> Guess we'll start with you.
And I'm worried she's gonna try to do this on her own.<eos> Sorry... didn't mean to wake you.<eos> I wasn't sleeping very well anyway.<eos> Hey, you.<eos> Did Renard talk to you?
Wait, Nick.<eos> I don't think this is such a good idea.<eos> We don't even know what kind of power this thing has or where it came from or what effect it's gonna have on you or us.<eos> It's the only option we've got, and we don't even know if it's gonna work.<eos> If it does, I'm going with you.
By skull guy.<eos> He was there.<eos> We were trying to kill him.<eos> He could've killed us, but he didn't.<eos> No, he needed you there to open the way from his side so he could cross over with you.
Now, there's a prophecy about something called a Shaphat.<eos> A child bride for evil.<eos> I'm not letting that thing anywhere near my daughter.<eos> You and Adalind need to hide her.<eos> Zerstoerer has connected with Eve and you in your loft, so that's out.
What did you guys do with the books?<eos> I wanna find out as much as I can about Zerstoerer.<eos> In the cellar, we left them out and open.<eos> We were kind of in a hurry to get here.<eos> Rosalee and I will go with you.
Nick and I met here to settle our differences about the key.<eos> Oh... that.<eos> Yeah, we both decided it couldn't fall into your hands.<eos> When you were working for the Royals.<eos> That was before I had a baby with you.
Oh... that.<eos> Yeah, we both decided it couldn't fall into your hands.<eos> When you were working for the Royals.<eos> That was before I had a baby with you.<eos> Or you.
- What?<eos> If he finds them, I need one of us with them.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - I'm going to the spice shop.<eos> I'll check in with you from there.
I have no idea, but it's... it's definitely a last-resort kind of potion.<eos> Maybe it's just what we need to defeat this evil bastard.<eos> Well, we're gonna have to ask Adalind, because my blood won't work anymore.<eos> I'll text Nick.<eos> Dude... we are taking you down.
It's all good.<eos> Keys.<eos> Now.<eos> Out.<eos> I ain't goin' anywhere with you.
Okay, so, we've officially got both the ATF and The Black 23's coming to kill us, and we've got maybe a five-minute head start before word gets back to Lynch that we sprung you.<eos> So whatever the hell is going on here, you better spill it now.<eos> Wanna hear a funny story?<eos> Paid a visit to the archives.<eos> Turns out the Waterstreet case had nothing to do with you.
Tommy... No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You were just a kid.<eos> You were scared.<eos> I-I shouldn't have stayed mad at you.
The kid... he just doesn't understand.<eos> I mean, buzz, what happened to gabe's family, That is not your fault.<eos> Isn't it?<eos> You have company.<eos> Why would you think I wanted to break up with you?
I gave him all the reasons why I thought it was a bad idea for us to move in together.<eos> I'm still in college.<eos> I have law school after that.<eos> It'll probably be years before I get a real job.<eos> And he broke up with you?
What is that, like a cartoon or something?<eos> You don't remember "Time Ryder" from the '90s?<eos> Sundial Cartoons?<eos> Must be drawing a blank.<eos> I get it, someone's zapped the memo eraser around you, very funny.
- Okay, goodnight, Bob.<eos> - Goodnight, Ja...<eos> See, here's the thing though.<eos> I don't wanna do the sessions, they're a waste of time.<eos> And how will wasting time with you solve my anxiety about wasting time with you?
Why are we here?<eos> I don't know, Bob.<eos> You barged into my room and now you refuse to leave.<eos> Some might call that a cry for help.<eos> So why don't we talk about what's really going on with you?
Is someone there?<eos> - It's me, Bob.<eos> - Jane.<eos> You sound so far away.<eos> I'm here. I'm in the room with you.
Hi, now take your seats, go on.<eos> Okay, what do you do when you see a Death Lizard?<eos> Run and hide!<eos> Shoot, I'm gonna be late.<eos> Evan, I need to talk to you.
-Let her tell me that.<eos> If you shout, I swear I'll kill you.<eos> Calm down, I'm begging you.<eos> [Pedro] I will when you tell your friend you're coming with me.<eos> -She's not going with you.
We're not a rich family, and you haven't got a husband to support you.<eos> I won't let you stay here for the rest of your life looking after an old lady.<eos> You gave up enough for your mother. God rest her soul.<eos> Sure, Grandma... but I was happy with you and my mother.<eos> She was with you, too. But you have to look out for yourself now.
[Carmen] It's not as if we're royalty.<eos> Since when do you mind being the center of attention?<eos> Who said I minded?<eos> Will anything ever be good enough for you?<eos> I thought marrying you was good enough.
[newsboy] Extra!<eos> Extra! First call to America today!<eos> Extra!<eos> Extra! The king calls America today!<eos> -Mario, can I talk to you?
[sighs and chuckles]<eos> Why am I surprised?<eos> If you love him, why think of me?<eos> You know Carlos didn't deserve to be left nothing.<eos> I agree with you on that. That's not what hurts me.
-But it's in Barcelona. -Yes.<eos> You want to send me to Barcelona?<eos> If you want to be rid of me, just say so!<eos> -Or maybe you don't love me!<eos> -Marga, no, I'm going with you.
I know you're not taking me out here to propose to me.<eos> Or are you?<eos> Are you gonna propose to me?<eos> Come on, man, you wanna swing?<eos> I'll swing with you, I don't give a shit.
Either path you take, there's no turning back.<eos> Yeah, John, this is Kevin again.<eos> Where the fuck are you, man?<eos> John.<eos> Come on, I need to talk to you.
Yeah, well, I don't believe it, and I didn't come here to see you.<eos> I came here to honor my father, so get up there, say what you're gonna say, and let's get this over with.<eos> Harvey.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I wanted to talk to you.
I wanted to talk to you.<eos> I can't believe it.<eos> This is wonderful.<eos> I thought maybe you wanted to get dinner tonight.<eos> There is nothing I would rather do than get dinner with you, but I can't tonight.
Let me guess... they were smart enough to appreciate they can get someone with your experience for ten cents on the dollar.<eos> You got it.<eos> $35,000 a year to be exact.<eos> Which means... we should probably start packing up the place now, 'cause we definitely cannot afford to live here anymore.<eos> I would live in a shoebox with you if it meant you were happy.
If she does that, she'll end up homeless.<eos> Which is why we need to be prepared for it to happen.<eos> Now, do you want to work on this thing together or not?<eos> I'm sorry I didn't tell you that she was gonna speak before you got here.<eos> I just didn't have it in me to have it out with you.
You think you can just walk into our lives and... and rip open old wounds?<eos> Your lives?<eos> You better get the hell out of my face before I do something that you'll regret.<eos> You already did something I regret by talking to your mother the way you did.<eos> That woman gave up the right to be called my mother when she got together with you behind my father's back.
- Harvey, Harvey...<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> Let him get it out of his system, 'cause I know I want to get it out of mine.<eos> I didn't come here to fight, Harvey.<eos> I came here to tell you I've never seen your mother more excited than when she was heading out to have dinner with you.
I came to apologize for yelling at you about going to Gibbs.<eos> - You don't have to do that.<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> I know you only had my best interest at heart.<eos> You always do, and... I shouldn't have snapped at you.
You covered what she owed with your own money, didn't you?<eos> Because that's above and beyond.<eos> We can talk about how awesome I am later.<eos> Right now, I need to make sure that Sofia's rent is paid by 10:00.<eos> Louis, can I talk to you?
Do you want me to fix Rachel's problem or not?<eos> I do.<eos> It's just... I thought we could talk.<eos> What do you mean talk?<eos> Harvey, please, I need to talk to you man-to-man.
Okay, Louis, I got a few minutes.<eos> You really can tell if it's fresh brewed or not?<eos> Please, this isn't my first rodeo.<eos> You're telling me.<eos> Donna, could I talk to you for a second?
Well, you know what...<eos> Never mind.<eos> I shouldn't have come to you.<eos> Louis, it doesn't matter what I see.<eos> What matters is what this woman sees, and she obviously sees something, or she wouldn't be with you.
And in return, you'll do what I want.<eos> No.<eos> You're gonna do it, because it's the right thing to do.<eos> But I'll do what you want for something else.<eos> I need to talk to you.
We talked about it, and I agree with him.<eos> Mike, I know this wasn't Oliver's idea.<eos> It was yours.<eos> 'Cause you don't think he's ready.<eos> Which is why I'm coming to you.
It's clear.<eos> This is a nice place you got here.<eos> When are they condemning it?<eos> What are you doing here, Harvey?<eos> I need to talk to you.
But if you're gonna get this worked up about something like this, it makes me think I don't really know you.<eos> Louis, can you honestly tell me that you really know me?<eos> Are we ready to take a picture?<eos> No, I don't.<eos> And now I feel like I'm ruining this, so... if you don't want me to come in with you, I won't.
We don't know everything about each other, but that just means we need to get to know each other better, and what better way to get to know each other then by preparing to bring our child into the world?<eos> Louis, if this is your reaction to what we went through today, I feel like I know you better already.<eos> Speaking of what we went through today, how'd it go?<eos> Why don't you take me home, and I'll tell you all about it.<eos> Harvey, can I talk to you for a second?
There's no point talking to her again.<eos> The point is that something was bothering her and she was ordered to suppress it.<eos> Mars is using peace as a distraction.<eos> "Peace as a distraction."<eos> God, I wish I could disagree with you right now.
Our children are out there somewhere scared and alone and you just...<eos> And you just leave?<eos> You just...<eos> Are you done?<eos> It's got nothing to do with you.
Dope.<eos> Yo. I got diarrhea.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Me too.<eos> I'll race you.
Yeah.<eos> All right.<eos> - Feel better.<eos> - Don't be mad at me.<eos> Why would I be mad at you?
I didn't have you pegged as a clich√©.<eos> Bartender at Sugar Foot said you might know where He is.<eos> - Which bartender's that?<eos> - Tall black guy.<eos> Said I should talk to you.
Completely taken me by surprise.<eos> It's actually very exhausting.<eos> Hang on.<eos> Don't let me forget.<eos> I've lined up my lawyer to talk to you if this whole Al Parker business gets out of control.
We drank it together straight from the bottle and, even before we'd finished, we were kissing each other, completely out of control.<eos> And the next day, after the pash in the car,<eos> I went into the office, and I expected him to be really cool and withdrawn and act as if nothing had happened.<eos> But he came straight up to me and he said,<eos> "I want to sleep with you tonight, if that's what you want, because that is definitely what I want."
Are you OK?<eos> We're thinking of going for a wander down the beach.<eos> It's a bit late.<eos> I'd like to go.<eos> I'm not doing that with you.
That's the best that you can do?<eos> I cared about her, too.<eos> For what, like, ten minutes, including foreplay?<eos> Are you mad at me because I cared too much or too little?<eos> I'm mad 'cause you fucked up the one thing that
I cared about her, too.<eos> For what, like, ten minutes, including foreplay?<eos> Are you mad at me because I cared too much or too little?<eos> I'm mad 'cause you fucked up the one thing that<eos> - we were counting on you for.
Who loves blood?<eos> I'm not gonna feel anything, so fucking go!<eos> - I don't think I can do this.<eos> - Oh, my God!<eos> I knew I fucking couldn't count on you!
- I don't think I can do this.<eos> - Oh, my God!<eos> I knew I fucking couldn't count on you!<eos> You are so fucking pathetic, you--you--you floppy-haired, limp dicked dork.<eos> Fucking--no wonder Alice couldn't get off on you.
- _ - Olivia's made a serious complaint against you.<eos> She no longer feels comfortable working with you.
Merry Christmas to me.<eos> What's stopping you from coming back?<eos> Mostly just the false sexual harassment charges.<eos> They weren't charges, it was just a complaint, which Olivia withdrew.<eos> - She was just having some fun with you.
- That's not true!<eos> - Yes, it is.<eos> And then you'd text me a shopping list while I'm in the emergency room.<eos> Do you want to break up with me?<eos> Do I want to break up with you?
I said that already?<eos> - Can I ask you something?<eos> - Please do.<eos> Can you get any of that food in your mouth?<eos> So you're saying I should quit right now and leave with you?
- He's a moron. - He's not a moron.<eos> He's a pompous know-it-all, smarmy little Ivy League pussy.<eos> - He went to San Diego State... actually. - You're kidding me right now, right?<eos> You corrected me 'cause he went to San Diego State?<eos> No, I'm agreeing with you.
It's scary, knowing your heart's not good.<eos> Sandy Wexler, you have the biggest, best, strongest heart in this whole miserable town.<eos> And that's a fact.<eos> Miserable town?<eos> It's been quite nice to you, thank you very much.
- What's his problem?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Just do what he says.<eos> It's an international call, so talk fast, okay?<eos> Can I count on you?
- I don't care what he is.<eos> - Let's walk this way.<eos> - Hold up, whitey.<eos> You listen to his control words.<eos> You think he's gonna stick by you when the bank repossesses your Miata, and they're taping up your bad checks on the wall at the 7-Eleven?
Something that describes me or my soul?<eos> Hopefully, one or two words that could fit into a URL?<eos> No, he doesn't really work in specifics like that.<eos> It's just more of feeling...<eos> That's true and I'm also not feeling you right now.
But we had a really fun night tonight.<eos> Don't let this one thing ruin it.<eos> - You don't get it.<eos> - I guess I don't.<eos> Am I crazy for not wanting our date to end with you all pissed off?
Oh, I totally saw Saw.<eos> - Shane, did you see Saw?<eos> - Don't want any part in this.<eos> Come on, you have to play along.<eos> I'm still mad at you.
I am not selling stuffed animals out of my bedroom.<eos> This is a real business.<eos> Cosigning a lease is a risky thing.<eos> I could lose my savings, my house.<eos> I tried to speak your language, to relate to you, to prove to you that I am worth betting on.
Holy crap.<eos> Look at us, we own this town.<eos> Suck it, Nash Bridges.<eos> Yeah, but, um...<eos> I'm not gonna take it, because I'd rather work here with you.
Suck it, Nash Bridges.<eos> Yeah, but, um...<eos> I'm not gonna take it, because I'd rather work here with you.<eos> Aw, that's sweet.<eos> I like working with you, too.
Well... I know it's hard to understand, but I... I just had to get out of there.<eos> So, you don't think that I'm... a garbage person?<eos> No, no.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> It had nothing to do with you.
But it'll be mine.<eos> Wait.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Wait.<eos> May I sing with you?
- Was it happening the whole time? - No, of course not.<eos> When did it start?<eos> - I told you.<eos> - Tell me again.<eos> Can I be honest with you?
- That was fast.<eos> - What was fast?<eos> Well, I assume you're here to tell me you filed suit against Velocity.<eos> What I'm here to tell you, Craig, is Mike Ross is gonna handle Velocity.<eos> Then we have a problem, 'cause I didn't cut a deal with Mike Ross. I cut a deal with you.
It's an executive kitchen.<eos> I'm an executive.<eos> Yeah, but you're a bagel guy.<eos> This place is like croissant central.<eos> Then maybe I just came in here hoping to spend some quality time with you.
This the kinda shit you pulled when you were at Pearson Specter?<eos> On occasion.<eos> Then I want you to say the next time you think to pull something like this, you have the common courtesy to tell me before you do it.<eos> I suggest a warm bubble bath and a pint of Chunky Monkey.<eos> Because if you're not good to yourself, how can you expect anyone else to be good to you?
Yes, and once it's done and Mike's in the Bar, he can come back here and work again.<eos> Harvey, that is great and nobody wants that more than I do, but it's just one meeting.<eos> Lewis, I know that, but in about three hours, I'm gonna be under water for the next three days.<eos> Harvey...<eos> Lewis, I know I told you I'd be there for you, but I need you to be there for me.
And if you hadn't set me up with him after I was fired, I don't know what I would have done.<eos> I'll book the chef.<eos> I assume from the fact that you called, you got our Christmas present.<eos> I didn't call you, I called Harvey Specter.<eos> Well, he called me. And I wanted to come have a little chat with you before you got it into your head that you could go behind my back and cut a deal without an admission of guilt.
My gift to you was saving your ass when you screwed the pooch by involving me in this case.<eos> Seriously, Harvey, I appreciate you rolling with this thing.<eos> Especially when I had to improvise.<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> The truth is, I like getting the chance to work with you again.
Holy shit.<eos> You are ready.<eos> Oliver.<eos> Hey, what are you doing here?<eos> I want to know if I was wrong about you.
It's every yearbook I've ever had.<eos> It was so nice doing it with yours the other night I thought maybe tonight we could do it with mine.<eos> Louis, what's wrong?<eos> Nothing's wrong.<eos> I... had a bad day and I wanted to talk to you about it.
No, I'm just thinking you're almost 21 and how grown up you are.<eos> Well, I-I know you don't want the job, but, um, good luck with your interview today, Mom.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You going down?<eos> I'll go with you.
Then facebook accounts promoting her as a yoga teacher, A real estate agent.<eos> She wrote an e-book about breaking up. With her girlfriend in 2015, and since joining instagram, She's taken up nature photography.<eos> Well, none of this is good enough for a warrant.<eos> We should pay karina a visit and find out. Why she left in such a hurry.<eos> I should go with you.
Look, I'll call Karen to smooth this over.<eos> Okay.<eos> Karen, it's Andre.<eos> Wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> Before you hang up, please, just let me just talk to you, let me explain what hap...
You told me to fall back.<eos> Do you know where he is or not?<eos> I could find out.<eos> Good.<eos> I'm coming with you.
Don't you think I feel bad enough?<eos> You come in here, I know you think you're better than me, you fucking asshole.<eos> All right, that's enough.<eos> I'm taking Elisa Marie to my place.<eos> She's not safe with you.
That's the most important thing for both of us to keep our jobs and our lives, do you understand?<eos> Mom?<eos> Raina.<eos> You said you loved my dad.<eos> You said you wanted us to live with you.
Look, man, he went missing.<eos> I'm sure Tasha's suspicious.<eos> She might be watching him.<eos> Where he goes, who he spends time with.<eos> Yo, if she catches him with you, this whole thing is over.
_<eos> Keep at it.<eos> This might be one of those all day things.<eos> So.<eos> What are we gonna do with you?
I know exactly where she is.<eos> You do?<eos> We're in a fight.<eos> So she's out somewhere being mad at me.<eos> Being mad at you?
Now, the police did a drive-by, but they didn't see nothing.<eos> And it's... it's got me wondering.<eos> It's best to be sure.<eos> I'm gonna go have a look, okay?<eos> - I'll come with you.
They'll be here, Kol.<eos> And while we have a moment, I wanted to say thank you.<eos> For what?<eos> For coming to get me.<eos> So I could be sitting here, annoyed at you.
But don't go in hard.<eos> He's practically one of ours.<eos> Hank.<eos> Bunny Fletcher is here.<eos> She says she's not leaving until she talks to you.
How dare you.<eos> You've been drinking, Bunny?<eos> You couldn't have me so you took my daughter.<eos> And you're still doing it.<eos> I think maybe Erin should run a DNA test on you.
Give her what she wants.<eos> My dear!<eos> Madame Agathe!<eos> You mentioned an extremely important consultation... but I did not dare dream it would be here.<eos> Now, I hope you understand how vital it is that he be inspired by his time with you.
You're changing and it scares me.<eos> You may be the Sun King, but, of late, when I look into your eyes, all I see is shadow.<eos> Are you thinking what I'm thinking?<eos> No.<eos> Of course you are, and I completely agree with you. It's self-evident.
Was it a powder or a liquid he poured onto the food?<eos> It was not him.<eos> You really suppose you were the only chambermaid to hoist her skirt up for him?<eos> He promised!<eos> To marry you?
We find the school with those colors,<eos> We find where the boy's been all these years.<eos> And maybe why no one's recently reported him missing.<eos> I'm on my way.<eos> I'll come with you.
It'll be our little secret.<eos> Thank you, Jay.<eos> What happened to him?<eos> I'm back.<eos> We need to talk to you.
So, Erlich, good news:<eos> Keenan Feldspar signed his term sheet, and we are now officially negotiating the finer points of his deal.<eos> Fantastic!<eos> Well, now the real work begins.<eos> To that end, we would like to clarify our arrangement with you.
Uh-huh. Well, try and get a selfie with Steph Curry.<eos> I will, assuming she's there.<eos> Hey, Jared, um, look at this e-mail here.<eos> Uh, "Dear Richard, I recently became aware of your Space Saver app.<eos> "I think your app may infringe upon my own patented technology. "If your schedule permits, I would love to discuss this with you as soon as possible.
What?<eos> Again, I... again...<eos> I don't really know why he would mention that.<eos> It's super gross.<eos> Is this why Gavin Belson stopped working with you?
Thank you.<eos> Okay, we're in.<eos> Sat of 97%.<eos> All right. Let's take advantage of her postictal state.<eos> And get her head scanned. Hey, bring ativan with you.
Actually, I'm surprised that you, My brilliant psychiatrist father, Never figured it out.<eos> Epidemiology is detective work.<eos> So, you see, dad,<eos> It's all about you. I'm all about you.<eos> You carry that around with you?
Feet are flushed.<eos> Below y-o-2?<eos> Suction ready.<eos> Ready.<eos> I'm gonna be working late tonight, But mai will stay with you until then.
I was explaining how you don't love her.<eos> Of course I love her.<eos> Then why don't you want her to have any friends?<eos> This is crazy.<eos> - Grace, can I please just talk to you?
If your heart stops beating again, it may never come back.<eos> This procedure... is it an operation?<eos> No, an infusion.<eos> It can be done right here in the treatment room.<eos> I'll be with you the whole time.
And healthy.<eos> We'll figure out the rest, okay? Together.<eos> - Mitch... - Yeah.<eos> Guys, if you can hold on for a second.<eos> - Have a word with you?
Your previous model had the Darkhold book in her hand.<eos> And all the answers it holds.<eos> You'll have to stay here for now until your substitute has served her purpose.<eos> I said the new Director should be a powered person the public could trust.<eos> And they came up with you.
Look.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I know it's bad timing, but you guys are gonna be fine.<eos> Okay?<eos> I'm gonna catch up with you when you get back.
Because if you enter every room thinking you got to do a song and dance, eventually everything becomes a performance.<eos> And believe me, I know how it feels putting on an act full-time.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You do, don't you?<eos> Anyway, I know it's not an act with you.
You put this in my head.<eos> Dr. Radcliffe knew the best way to keep you busy was to give you something to fight.<eos> - Something like you.<eos> - Yes, but this is the program's end.<eos> We're coding more, but we can't keep up with you.
I'm tired of playing games, Mack.<eos> Coulson said that if I wanted to know where you went today, I should ask, and he's right.<eos> Um...<eos> I went to see my ex.<eos> I-I've been wanting to talk to you about this, and...
Agent Coulson, come with me.<eos> I'm going with them.<eos> So, what was it like growing up with four of them?<eos> There was a lot of crying.<eos> - They picked on you?
Hello, Agent May.<eos> Mission accomplished.<eos> This is exactly what you were supposed to do.<eos> I'm eternally grateful.<eos> Take me with you.
Superior.<eos> That's all I wanted to hear.<eos> I leave the city now.<eos> You've made it far too great a risk to even be in this country.<eos> We both know S.H.I.E.L.D. will come for you and try to take you down.
- Huh? You see the mining facility in this picture?<eos> He owns it.<eos> Purchased by Anton Ivanov this year.<eos> It's the only thing here that ties back to him.<eos> Does it tie back to you, too?
You don't know.<eos> You don't even know, like May.<eos> Stop it!<eos> The ...<eos> The same goes for you.
I'm sorry.<eos> Don't... make me feel bad for you.<eos> - Don't hurt me.<eos> - I couldn't.<eos> I'm not gonna fight you, Jemma.
I'm sorry.<eos> What are you apologizing for?<eos> It's been a few years.<eos> It makes sense to take this step.<eos> I would love to live with you.
I had my doubts about the project, but I finally see it.<eos> Your new body will be stronger.<eos> That's who you were meant to be.<eos> I just have one request.<eos> Take me with you.
What do you mean?<eos> I'll keep the signal going, hold the fort as long as I can.<eos> No, ward, you -- you don't have to do that.<eos> That's --<eos> I know I'm not going with you when you leave, but I can still help out from this side.
That's just the tip of the iceberg.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> What if I told you this whole world isn't real, that it's just a simulation meant to keep us imprisoned?<eos> I'd say you need to be medicated.<eos> And up until a week ago, I would have agreed with you.
Martial law is now in effect.<eos> We have three subversives detained.<eos> Maximum force protocols authorized for all sectors.<eos> Hail Hydra.<eos> I'm not talking to you.
I'm really more of a...<eos> "work in the shadows" kind of guy.<eos> Really?<eos> That's how teaching 10th grade works best... from the shadows?<eos> I'll be honest with you...
And the first thing I choose, Leopold is you.<eos> It's not that simple!<eos> Then explain it to me.<eos> What stopped you?<eos> - He was right there with you, no?
You mad that I was Hydra in there?<eos> I don't blame you for that.<eos> Then, what?<eos> Did something weird happen with my robot self?<eos> Did I make a move on you?
Shame.<eos> I will miss that place.<eos> Come on, stay awake.<eos> We need to find a way to the surface.<eos> And I haven't been totally honest with you about what happened when you were not around.
- You watched, unaffected, as I took a hammer to the bones of the Director's corpse.<eos> I couldn't feel this then!<eos> Now you are like an infant, unable to process these new emotions or the idea that you don't always get everything that you want.<eos> And you have yet to experience the thrill that killing can bring.<eos> Maybe I'll experience that now... with you.
Previously on "Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."...<eos> I haven't been totally honest with you.
We offer a solution, a path to putting S.H.I.E.L.D. and their Inhumans away once and for all.<eos> This book opened my eyes to the truth about Inhumans.<eos> It contains a plan to defeat them, and you can all be a part of it.<eos> I smell a load of L. Ron Horsecrap.<eos> Daisy, goodness. Is Coulson with you?
- There's music and art...<eos> - And smashing heads on the floor.<eos> That's the one I like the best so far.<eos> Did you know that blood has a copper smell?<eos> Okay, Ophelia, I'll go with you.
We can go away, start again.<eos> Too late.<eos> This is making me feel better.<eos> Fitz, why do we feel better when we make someone else suffer?<eos> Because there's something wrong with you, you psycho!
Mack!<eos> Mack.<eos> That was horrifying.<eos> I don't know how you live with it all the time.<eos> I'm just grateful Ghost Rider kept its part of the deal and went back to you.
I feel terrible that I tried to pull you away from her and worse that we couldn't save her.<eos> Can you forgive me?<eos> There's nothing to forgive.<eos> Those years with her, as a father, it'll always be a part of me.<eos> But they also gave me a glimpse of a life I could have here... with you.
We gonna do this shit or what, man?<eos> Amber!<eos> Amber?<eos> Why ain't you returning any of my calls?<eos> Maybe because I don't wanna talk to you, Ricky.
How about Cesar?<eos> My daughter is now a widow.<eos> And my grandson has no father.<eos> I am trying to avoid a war here, Eli.<eos> Nice talking with you, neighbor.
I don't want to stay here by myself anymore.<eos> Well, you're not by yourself.<eos> You've got Rose, Holly, Aunt Megan.<eos> I want to be with my real family.<eos> I want to be with you.
You had me worried sick, Firefly.<eos> I told you I didn't want to stay in that cabin anymore.<eos> Yeah, I know, but where are you going in the middle of the night?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I just wanted to be with you.
What about...<eos> What about the woman in the car?<eos> She's doing OK, she broke her collarbone.<eos> Her face is pretty smashed up.<eos> Have you got someone staying with you?
We've got both pick-ups on CCTV.<eos> So?<eos> I wasn't speeding, I didn't park on double yellows.<eos> I just want to know who the other passenger was, the man who was already in the cab when you picked him up.<eos> I don't have to talk to you, I've done nothing wrong.
- I love you.<eos> - Love you too.<eos> We need to talk about this.<eos> About what?<eos> What, the fact that I had sex with you when I was perfectly happy in my relationship?
But make it clear that Mary caught the French Pox under her roof.<eos> Do we know that to be true?<eos> Use your arts!<eos> How hard is it to pay for washing?<eos> I'll be with you just now, handsome.
I'm quaking with fear!<eos> I know what you are.<eos> Marie-Louise tells me that you still keep your girls locked in.<eos> Sounds an awful lot like kidnap. You dare!<eos> You dare play that vengeful trick on me again and I will raze your house to the ground with you and all your vile spawn in it.
What a startling joy.<eos> I came to see Charlotte.<eos> She's deserted me, yet again.<eos> You'll have to... keep me company.<eos> I paid my debt to you.
I need one too, Ma.<eos> I've got to get away from Sir George.<eos> Can I come home for a while?<eos> Greek Street's not your home.<eos> You know my meaning, with you and Lucy.
She came to us in a dreadful state.<eos> Said you'd beaten her obscenely.<eos> So Margaret Wells has been foolish enough to take her in.<eos> We gave her some comfort and sent her on her way.<eos> I told her I wanted no conflict with you.
Are you in earnest?<eos> You once told me that a harlot did nothing but pretend.<eos> I can't pretend, I want to leave.<eos> To leave London?<eos> With you.
‚ô™ ‚ô™ Two shillings!<eos> Bobby!<eos> - Leave me alone.<eos> - Bobby, I miss your dirty whore-pipe. I want it up my sweet nutmeg cunny.<eos> I can't be seen with you.
- Let's go.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> I hope she gives you pleasure, as she willingly gave me.<eos> (sharp groan)<eos> Whatever will become of you, Betsey?
I said it was good.<eos> Zoom in on the serial number and then trace it back to the owner.<eos> It's always good to give a girl a good helping' whenever you can.<eos> Just like they do in the shows and that.<eos> I couldn't agree with you more. What are you talkin' about?
Just like they do in the shows and that.<eos> I couldn't agree with you more. What are you talkin' about?<eos> Talking about zooming' in on the gun to find out who shot at you. Just zoom in...<eos> Okay, seriously.<eos> What the hell happened with you and this girl?
What happened?<eos> He took the deal.<eos> But you have to stay.<eos> All three of you.<eos> What about you?
Not anymore.<eos> I said get on your knees.<eos> What did you do?<eos> The only living man without a soul.<eos> That's why the Word didn't work on you.
- Once, we built a hotel in Panama, and some locals blew up one of our trucks with a fucking bomb.<eos> So, you know, bring it on.<eos> The most important thing is to start.<eos> We start. And once we start, we have the momentum.<eos> This is why I love working with you.
Oh, it is so nice out here.<eos> Oh, we feel so lucky.<eos> Except we bought at the height of the market.<eos> Other than that, we feel lucky.<eos> Well, you can't take it with you.
Hello.<eos> Blessed be the fruit...<eos> May the Lord open.<eos> I'm Commander Waterford.<eos> Peace be to you.
No, I just don't like tuna very much.<eos> Maybe he's lonely.<eos> Maybe he watches me.<eos> Maybe he's an Eye.<eos> Peace be with you.
It hurts.<eos> - Such a special day.<eos> - Such a blessed day. Breathe.<eos> Breathe.<eos> We are right here with you.
Hi.<eos> I imagine you must find this strange.<eos> I guess it's a little strange.<eos> I want... This will sound silly.<eos> I'd like to play a game with you.
Don't get too close to her.<eos> It's dangerous.<eos> Trusting anyone is dangerous.<eos> Especially a carpet-munching gender traitor.<eos> I'd like to play a game with you.
Other than that...<eos> You're dripping.<eos> I brought you some ice.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I wish... I should've... I should've just driven away with you.
Tara Messer, will you marry me?<eos> Yes, Louis, I'll marry you.
Good. You're here early.<eos> I need you to take point on a consumer fraud hearing for Sandra.<eos> Nathan, I need to talk to you.<eos> Okay.<eos> I know things got heated between us the other night, but as far as I'm concerned, it's water under the bridge, so if you're wondering if I'm still upset at you...
Well, I got news for you: I'm not Dominos.<eos> That's too bad, because slinging pizzas might be the only job you can get if you don't stop shitting the bed.<eos> Shitting the bed?<eos> How's that?<eos> I've been trying to get you on the phone for two weeks.
So the next time you want to put your personal life ahead of the needs of this firm, you better goddamn come to me a year in advance.<eos> That's not fair.<eos> He couldn't have known he was gonna have a baby a year...<eos> Let me tell you something, Stephanie:<eos> Maybe you don't know how babies are made, because when people are trying, they know they're trying, and just because no one ever wants to try with you doesn't give you the right to tell me how to run my associates.
Well, then let me explain a little something to you called pecking order.<eos> See, I am up here.<eos> Rachel's down here.<eos> And you don't give dominion over your associates to someone down here.<eos> I know that, but I also know that Tara broke up with you last night, and you're not in your right mind.
- What you may not know is that it's not unnatural for a therapist to feel the same way.<eos> You don't think I've had fantasies about you?<eos> That one day you'd show up at my office as I was heading home for the night, and I turn around, and you'd be there.<eos> You wouldn't say a word, but... you'd take me in your arms and kiss me, and... it would actually be the start of something special.<eos> Well, I have, which is why despite my better judgment, I'm here with you right now. - So what's the problem?
You got a problem with me calling the shots?<eos> No, Harvey.<eos> No problem.<eos> You're managing partner.<eos> I don't want to talk to you right now, Louis...
Mrs. Waterford, this is state business.<eos> She's pregnant!<eos> I just wanted to check if you were okay.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I should've just driven away with you.
No. Frozen is the closest thing to fresh.<eos> What if we got a meat freezer and put it in the storage unit and when we kill somebody, we can just chisel off chunks of it when I need to eat.<eos> Wow. There's gonna be chiseling.<eos> Sweetie, I can do this on my own.<eos> No, I'm going with you.
Well... it just got too God damn risky.<eos> Hey. What's going on?<eos> You got out of bed before it was light out.<eos> And you never came back.<eos> I want to talk to you for a minute.
Not gonna be a lawyer.<eos> Mike.<eos> The thing is, I was fine with it until Harvey started dangling it in front of my face.<eos> I think the problem was, I actually started believing it could happen.<eos> Do you want me to stay with you today?
Because my partner and I, we're gonna go wide with this and we're going to need an investor.<eos> Why are you coming to me with this?<eos> Because I wanted to give someone the chance to take it off the market.<eos> And it needed to be someone with the confidence to call his mother "Mommy."<eos> It's typical you would have us meet you here.
Because I don't wanna spend the rest of my life with a man who gave up on his dreams.<eos> And I know that you don't wanna be that man either.<eos> Louis?<eos> What are you doing in here?<eos> Rachel, can I talk to you a second?
Where are you going?<eos> I accidentally forgot my pen in the conference room.<eos> I have one you can borrow.<eos> Benjamin, when I say accidentally, I mean intentionally because it gives me an excuse to go back in there and eavesdrop on what they're saying about us.<eos> That's a great idea. Can I come with you?
Because when they see me without you, they're gonna think it's two against one and they'll make me an offer to cut you out.<eos> Wait, you actually think they would do that?<eos> Of course they will.<eos> These guys are vultures.<eos> Well, then shouldn't I go with you so we can stop it?
And just so you know, when I put my money where my mouth is, I throw everything I have into it.<eos> I wouldn't expect anything less from a big mouth like you.<eos> Done?<eos> Done.<eos> I gotta say, the world's gonna be a better place with you as a lawyer.
Thanks, Harvey.<eos> Actually, you weren't really in the Bar, ever.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'd ask how your day was, but last time I did that, it didn't go very well.<eos> Tara, can I be honest with you?
What is that supposed to mean?<eos> It means you're sitting there like you're the high priestess of moral authority, when the first time we slept together, you were with another man.<eos> How can you say that to me?<eos> I was up front about it with you and with him.<eos> You were up front about it with everybody and then you wanted me to be up front with you about things.
But you didn't, so now I have to.<eos> Oliver, hey, wait!<eos> Please, hear me out!<eos> I'm not gonna hear you out, Mike.<eos> I was sitting here for an hour, hoping I was wrong about you.
- Look at that, even when we cancel, I feel like I'm getting to know you better.<eos> Me too.<eos> So are you gonna tell me what's going on?<eos> You know what?<eos> Now that I just talked to you, I feel like I can
No.<eos> Must be nice.<eos> Ten ways to tell how he feels about you.<eos> Number two.<eos> He keeps finding ways to accidentally run into you.
He called yesterday.<eos> He said he'd be back later on this afternoon.<eos> I'll support you.<eos> Okay?<eos> If you think that Ian and this Hollow Sky could be dangerous, I will go with you to the police, stand next to you while you tell them everything.
Did you make your proposal to the committee?<eos> Yes, if it did any good.<eos> D6 and 7.<eos> What about you?<eos> I've barely had a chance to talk to you.
Another time.<eos> Okay.<eos> Not tonight.<eos> Okay.<eos> Pleasure doing business with you.
And don't open it either.<eos> Hide it until someone contacts you.<eos> Look, you came to me.<eos> And this is what they need now.<eos> Can they count on you or not?
Praised be His bounty.<eos> Blessed day.<eos> Saved it for you.<eos> Special.<eos> Peace be with you.
Blessed day.<eos> Saved it for you.<eos> Special.<eos> Peace be with you.<eos> Peace be with you.
I'll have you know I'm kind of a big deal around here.<eos> I'm the Earp heir.<eos> Destined to fight Wyatt's revenant demons.<eos> End a curse?<eos> I took you out with a lamp.
- What are you doing?<eos> Pretty easy from this side.<eos> I just hit the button.<eos> Well, hit it again!<eos> - I'm coming with you!
Linda... something.<eos> I guess. Linda.<eos> Linda, who has "Solsbury Hill" on every single one of her Spotify playlists.<eos> Her heart is going boom-boom-boom.<eos> She could end you.
I'm guilty.<eos> I did it.<eos> What will be will be.<eos> Jesus, Alex.<eos> I don't wanna talk about this with you anymore.
That's bullshit.<eos> What does the water have to do with your case?<eos> Just get Penetti something and get the fuck out of there.<eos> What are you doing, man?<eos> What's going on with you?
Don't do this, Hawk.<eos> But you say you want to help people.<eos> This is how you can make the greatest impact.<eos> Did your mom ever leave you stranded at a friend's birthday party for hours after everyone else had gone home?<eos> Your friends' parents just staring at you, not knowing what to do with you except never invite you back, obviously.
Travis would want that.<eos> You don't know what Travis would want.<eos> Joe.<eos> Man, who'd you piss off the draw guard again, huh?<eos> Your father wants to talk to you.
All right, everybody, that's enough fun.<eos> The show's over.<eos> Go back to doing what you were doing.<eos> Go in there, get yourself looked after.<eos> - Mom, I want to be with you.
And all the while I was singing Juan Gabriel to a cactus.<eos> Yeah, that's right.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> I'm... I'm assuming... Thomas did not...?<eos> So, you escaped this hotel in this crazy woman's car, and all you have with you are your wits and charms and this crunchy suede coat?
If we don't catch that thing out there, a lot more people will die.<eos> People die every day.<eos> I wanted to believe we could stop this.<eos> We can't.<eos> Take Amos with you.
Call when you're ready to launch.<eos> Prax.<eos> Go with them.<eos> No.<eos> I'm going with you.
If he's in bed with the Martians...<eos> He holds all the cards here.<eos> Make him a peace offering.<eos> I'll grovel, even if it's from a prison cell.<eos> He won't speak to you, Sadavir.
Trying to trick me, huh?<eos> Like that sebakawala who flies this ship?<eos> Calm these people down and line them up.<eos> Children first, best you can.<eos> Do it and I'll trade places with you.
This is why people hate Valentine's Day, you know, drone strikes.<eos> - Oh, yeah. - Yeah.<eos> Oh, welcome to Cloud 9.<eos> Welcome to Cloud 9.<eos> Cloud 9 welcomes you.
I love break time, great time to kick back and see what's in the old locker, huh?<eos> Wh... what you got there?<eos> I don't think this is my locker.<eos> Yeah, it is.<eos> It just looks like someone left you some flowers and chocolates and a duck.
He's been here.<eos> I smell abs.<eos> Ugh, I smell us.<eos> When did I have a hot dog?<eos> I shared one with you while you were sleeping.
My relationship is really over, and I'm starting to lose feeling in my downstairs.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Ugh. I'm sorry I dragged you across the country.<eos> You didn't drag me anywhere.<eos> I wanted to be here with you.
Make it 6%.<eos> I mean, what else am I gonna do, hmm?<eos> Stop.<eos> Oleg, stop blocking the door.<eos> We're not on a date with you.
But I lived through it.<eos> I got hit by a cab on my way to JFK.<eos> You mean you got hit by a cab on your way from JFK.<eos> You were in New York to see me, right?<eos> Track me down, beg me to take you back, pull my hair a little?
I have terms...<eos> A dozen laser sessions, at least.<eos> And one of them is, I don't talk about my clients.<eos> What happens in my office is sacrosanct.<eos> I don't talk about my sessions with you or anyone.
Previously on Billions...<eos> Danny fucking Margolis.<eos> What brings you back?<eos> I have some ideas, and I'd love to share them with you.
Look at these.<eos> 1998 Special Fundadores.<eos> Aged to peak complexity.<eos> And if they're not smoked soon, they'll go one-dimensional.<eos> I was hoping to smoke them with you at Foley's party, but while I've received my invitation, you were left off the list.
I know that this is difficult to grasp, but the age of the kingmaker is past.<eos> I don't need a power broker.<eos> I have my own power.<eos> And when it is made manifest, Foley will zip his fucking pants up and look me in the eye.<eos> Foley won't talk to you.
That's kind of the whole point of having people.<eos> Yeah, but if we're building a school to coax some goodwill, I think it's probably a good idea for one of us to actually be involved.<eos> It's the least we can do.<eos> We did take their prize statue.<eos> Well, you know I'd come up with you if I could.
You know, they say that a boy never really becomes a man until he's buried his father.<eos> Now, mine's been dead to me since the moment he walked out when I was 12 years old.<eos> I don't remember if I cried, but I do remember that I was forced to grow the fuck up.<eos> So it always warms my heart when I see a boy who still has his father's shoulder to lean on, his father's contacts to deploy, his father's balls clanking around in place of his own,<eos> Hold on to this man, Chuck, for one day soon, he will be gone, and then you will finally have to do something for yourself.
Dad. Let's take a walk.<eos> Son, everything I did was for you.<eos> Because you were born too soon and started too late?<eos> Look, if you're going to hide me, just let loose.<eos> Dad, Dad, I'm not mad at you.
That's an edge.<eos> That's Camelot right there.<eos> That is a picture of a man running for office.<eos> - Our deal hold?<eos> - Yes, but not for you.
And a, "true steward" of a multi-billion dollar charitable foundation, what would that put me back, Wags?<eos> In the range of $350,000 to $500,000 a year, I think it was.<eos> Yeah.<eos> See, I have looked into this before. And you are not the first one in here looking to double his salary.<eos> But today is your lucky day, because I do want to set up a permanent foundation with you as its steward.
When do you... give up?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Dollar Bill's telling the truth.<eos> It looks clean.<eos> Even if they trace his burner or get into his air-gapped laptop, like I did, nothing will come back to you, unless somebody talked.
Why were you sitting with Thayer in the first place?<eos> How does that help you with headlines, blind items... community leaders?<eos> You weren't encouraging me to be smart. You were protecting one of your own.<eos> Did you handpick him for the deal?<eos> Did I make a mistake with you?
Welcome to my bowling club.<eos> I worked it out so I had it private tonight.<eos> Sweet.<eos> How are ya, Victor?<eos> Lots of times, I thought about, if I ran into you, what I might say... or do.
You can't.<eos> Unless you can somehow anticipate where it will strike and then match its strength when it does... which you can't.<eos> I can see books are a trigger for you...<eos> Thank you, Sacker.<eos> Dad, I'm messengering something to you, and I will be over to discuss it in a while.
I see how we made it... because we forgot.<eos> I forgot... where I'm from.<eos> I forgot that I don't give a fuck about any of this.<eos> It's all sailcloth held up with poles lit by lighting designers and ripped to the ground tomorrow.<eos> I wanna be with you.
Another time.<eos> - Nope.<eos> - Sorry, can't let it go.<eos> I've been watching you pace about five miles in here.<eos> What the fuck's going on with you?
Good luck.<eos> Hello?<eos> Roberto, it's Larry Boyd.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - I need to talk to you.
Right into his face. Was he wearing a mask?<eos> Yeah, that's why his head stayed on, but his jaw... shattered.<eos> Now, is that gonna come back and bite me?<eos> If you hadn't told me, could've ended your campaign, but I know how to spin it as a strong anti-bullying stance.<eos> By the time I'm finished with you, you'll be signing baseball bats every time you appear in public.
Mercy is weakness.<eos> Strength is truth.<eos> Those are the lessons of Calcutta.<eos> Lessons I've been teaching to colonists ever since as a member of the Royal Army, in Guyana or the Caribbean.<eos> And now here in New York with you.
All I know is I'm looking at a dead man.<eos> If you think your friends will come for you, they won't.<eos> It don't matter.<eos> I know they'll kill you, and that's as good as me doing it.<eos> I learned other things in India, things I'm eager to share with you.
Wave, act like we're all friends.<eos> Whoa.<eos> - Richard!<eos> - No.<eos> Who's with you?
Gonna find out.<eos> - Where's Alicia?<eos> - Bible study.<eos> - Hold up, Nick, I'm coming.<eos> - Wait, I'm coming with you.
We all had you for dead.<eos> I was spared.<eos> I don't know why.<eos> I don't have a home waiting for me in heaven.<eos> Maybe it was the devil that wants me down here with you.
Do you see that?<eos> Hermosa.<eos> Russell and Martha, the couple who used to live here, they met when he was injured during the Korean War and she was a nurse at the Army hospital in Tokyo.<eos> And she nursed him back to health.<eos> And the day he was discharged, he said, "I'm gonna marry you."
You wanna go, go.<eos> You don't wanna go out there, Mr. Trimbol.<eos> My mind's made up.<eos> I'm sorry, Jeremiah.<eos> Mike going with you?
He stayed in school when I got... I got pulled.<eos> But he never quit on me.<eos> Never.<eos> Even when others did.<eos> He didn't quit on you, Troy.
This... this makes it more urgent, more reason to go, not less.<eos> When I said for you to own it, I didn't mean this.<eos> I'm not doing this because of what you said, Alicia.<eos> Right.<eos> I'm coming with you.
He didn't.<eos> He was with me.<eos> We have a parley.<eos> I need you to go back and tell my father the terms.<eos> Taqa will send a scout with you.
If Walker's gonna take this place...<eos> - Try to.<eos> - Try to...<eos> She needs to be on what she thinks is the winning side.<eos> Shouldn't that be our side, with you?
- I made a deal with that guy!<eos> - Against your father's wishes!<eos> - To save all of us!<eos> - He played you!<eos> Walker wasn't gonna negotiate with you!
She's free to leave.<eos> How old is your son?<eos> He's 19.<eos> If he's strong, he'll live.<eos> My fight is not with you, Madison.
Like father, like daughter.<eos> Boy, I'll tell you, I remember that night he died 'cause his secretary came banging on the door at, like, 2:00 AM.<eos> - We don't have to talk about this stuff - if you don't want to.<eos> - No, it's okay.<eos> I like talking about it, even with you.
Hey, where you going?<eos> - Excuse me. I tell you, if more people would've seen that side of you during the election, my God, you would've gotten their vote and you would've gotten mine. I think you probably would've won.<eos> Well, I'm telling you something, I wanna talk to you, Quartie, about the library that I'm planning now. - It's a...<eos> - Gary, don't you walk away from me, boy!<eos> I ain't through with you yet.
- Half the village is here.<eos> Think about how it looks if you leave together.<eos> Wait for me behind the pavilion.<eos> Sidney?<eos> I was wondering if I might speak to you about joining your church.
I rest my case.<eos> And tomorrow I'm taking golf lessons thanks to our community board.<eos> Apparently, I don't meet the weight minimum for Krav Maga.<eos> You know what?<eos> I'll go with you.
I'm so excited.<eos> I'm about to lose control and I think I like it!<eos> You know what?<eos> I don't need to have sex.<eos> I'll just play golf with you.
- Hey.<eos> - What's going on, man?<eos> Bobby!<eos> Hey, I was just on my lunch break, thought I'd stop by and almost see you.<eos> Well, it was nice dating you.
Oleg, shouldn't we be getting off at the next exit?<eos> Do you think we should exit at 33B, Misty?<eos> Ooh, that exit is closed for construction, naughty boy.<eos> Since we're having a day off from Barbara, I put the GPS on XXX.<eos> Can't a woman just talk to you?
Pfft, no.<eos> She is long gone, like my bangs or democracy.<eos> Bobby never brings her up.<eos> We just talk about our common interests, like how much we like my hair or how pretty I am.<eos> Yeah, but circling back to other people, which is very hard with you,
- Your parents have a car?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I'll figure out the gas problem.<eos> It'll only be a second.<eos> I'll go with you.
He buried her, too.<eos> When he did, he told me. God listens to those who call to Him with favor.<eos> It was church talk for,<eos> "It's your fault for not praying hard enough."<eos> I'm glad he didn't come back with you.
You don't know how to do that.<eos> Of course I do.<eos> You never loved me.<eos> That is true.<eos> And if I can love, I guess that means there's something wrong with you, not me.
It was you who set the fire.<eos> Jesus, Shelley, you gotta stop this craziness.<eos> They're starting to believe you.<eos> You have to confess, or I'll do it for you.<eos> I wanted to, so I went to your office to talk to you.
We'll take the forest route.<eos> All right, let's go!<eos> Okay, everybody!<eos> We need to warn the villagers.<eos> I'll go with you.
What?<eos> Just a few friends... came over to hang out. Come on in. Oh, no, wait.<eos> No.<eos> Come on in. Come on.<eos> Gideon, in the real world, when someone calls and says they need to talk to you, and you tell them to come over, you have to mention the fact that you have, like...
Hang on.<eos> I'll get his file.<eos> You.<eos> Hey.<eos> I need to talk to you.
Why it went off?<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> They're working the forensics, but the leading theory now is... stuff happens.<eos> Speaking of which, um...<eos> I wanted to talk to you about that transfer that your ex-husband gave you.
Pee.<eos> - Don't bring shit up like that, man.<eos> - What?<eos> History is a beautiful thing.<eos> I haven't talked to you since the...
It didn't.<eos> I'm so sorry, Major.<eos> Then this is it.<eos> Once I heal up, I take the cure, and everyone I've ever known is wiped from my memory.<eos> Maybe the cure won't have the same effect on you.
Pajamas.<eos> Laundry day pajamas.<eos> I thought,<eos> "There's no way this girl is into me."<eos> I was comfortable around you.
[Carolina] How can you be so sure she's going to quit?<eos> Because I'm her husband... and I ordered her to do it.<eos> Well, Sara's offered her a promotion... and from what I heard, the conditions are much better than what she's had up to now.<eos> [Mario] She didn't say anything to me.<eos> Nothing can justify the way Lidia treated you.
That's what Victoria said.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I wanted to apologize.<eos> I acted like an idiot this morning.<eos> I felt bad and took it out on you. It wasn't your fault.
So why tell me now?<eos> [chuckles] Because now I know what I want, Mario.<eos> I do now.<eos> I listen to you, and I see what a wonderful night we're having... and I know what I want.<eos> I know I want to be with you.
Yes, of course.<eos> [Alba] Bonjour, Beltr√°n.<eos> You bitch.<eos> You can tell your thugs to leave me alone or to get their passports... and cross the Pyrenees.<eos> I swear I won't stop until I find you.
You look fearsome.<eos> I think I preferred you with a sword.<eos> Ah, my sword has become heavy.<eos> But you could probably kill someone with that, though.<eos> I need to speak to you plainly.
I see you're drinking again, Aethelwold.<eos> It's just a cup or two, nothing more.<eos> I have news for you.<eos> You know where to find me.<eos> Before you take yourself away to an inn, I wish to speak with you.
Yeah, yeah. He's growing up.<eos> Hey, uh, can I talk to you for a minute?<eos> Um, sure... sure.<eos> Yeah, I... I just wanted to say that... that... we are grateful, uh, for what you did with Alison. Oh...<eos> - And... and we owe you.
Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> How's he doing?<eos> Good.<eos> All right. Come over here.<eos> I want to talk to you for a second.
Good.<eos> All right. Come over here.<eos> I want to talk to you for a second.<eos> Are you... are you sure you're okay?<eos> So, I have not been, um... completely honest with you over the last few months.
- Oh... - And really enjoy it.<eos> Here.<eos> Not you.<eos> Too rude.<eos> I don't always want to speak to you, because you give the impression
Uh, see you at the premiere.<eos> Wait, we're phasing out the diner?<eos> I have really gotta stop falling asleep immediately whenever you speak.<eos> Max, think about it. Why...<eos> Han, we need to talk to you.
Let me just fix that hair.<eos> It's still doing that thing that I hate.<eos> Actually, it might just be the shape of your head.<eos> Walk a little in front of me.<eos> I want to share this moment with you, but I want to do it alone.
Are you gonna give me a reason you're so beautiful?<eos> Are you gonna give me a reason... okay, fine, I'll give you a drink.<eos> I just got over you.<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> I want to be with you.
I just got over you.<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> I want to be with you.<eos> Oh, please!<eos> You think you can just come in here in your suit and be like, "Uh, I wanna be with you, Max."
Anyway, none of that superficial stuff matters.<eos> What matters is that I love you, and I owe $10,000 for this dress.<eos> Just a heads-up. I see London, I see... Your whole left butt cheek is out.<eos> I may have a solution to your $10,000 problem.<eos> I am not going in on that Little Caesar's franchise with you.
I saw you at dinner, right?<eos> What's your name?<eos> Amelia.<eos> My mom's getting ready.<eos> She'll be with you tonight.
My name's Portia.<eos> But you can call me whatever you want.<eos> I don't need any company.<eos> You can go with her.<eos> If I don't spend time with you,
This is truly a milestone in the war against evil.<eos> None of this changes the fact that you kept crucial information from me.<eos> About who you are, where you're from, when you're from, and about my daughter.<eos> And that you think there is a world in which I'm gonna let you take her anywhere near any of this.<eos> I assure you upon my honor, every one of us will be with you for every step of this journey, and Molly's safety is absolute paramount.
And trust me, son...<eos> You ain't that bad.<eos> Odessa!<eos> Why aren't you training with the others?<eos> And why did you want me to meet you?
The other Barons would never suspect an alliance.<eos> And when it's just the two of us left standing?<eos> Then I expect you'll try to kill me before I kill you.<eos> Do we have a deal?<eos> A moment alone with you first.
But you were always so pragmatic, even to the point of, of marrying my weak, traitorous son.<eos> Why not admit it?<eos> The only difference between us is that, is that I'm honest about who I am.<eos> You are deluded.<eos> And I was only pragmatic in marrying you.
No.<eos> No, there isn't.<eos> And I cannot guarantee this is gonna work either.<eos> I've seen the Abbots use these before on one of my friends.<eos> Better him than you, trust me.
A friend.<eos> She makes me happy.<eos> You deserve to be happy.<eos> Tilda.<eos> Mother would like to speak to you.
You'll find everything you need inside.<eos> Consider it a farewell gift.<eos> So long, sunshine.<eos> Goodbye, Waldo.<eos> Now I remember why I married you first.
They trust you.<eos> Look, I just can't do it, Miranda.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I knew you'd do this.<eos> I just knew you'd pull the rug out right from under me when I finally gave in and slept with you.
You're an intelligent woman, you have skills, and you find it a bit of an insult that you're being asked to be a... baby vessel, right?<eos> Believe it or not, I'm very familiar with the feeling of being undervalued.<eos> I'll always be grateful to people who saw my potential.<eos> Gave me the opportunity to excel.<eos> That's what I'm doing with you.
Don't call her that.<eos> If she dies saving the world, that is a good death.<eos> Luna, please.<eos> You're wounded.<eos> And I don't want to fight you.
We haven't always agreed on everything, but I've always felt that your heart was in the right place.<eos> I need you to keep an eye on the vice president, make sure he's working in the country's best interests, not his own.<eos> You understand what I'm saying?<eos> I do, sir.<eos> I'm counting on you.
No, afraid not.<eos> I'd like to question her, if it's all right.<eos> You know, under any other circumstances, I'd have to say no.<eos> But nothing about this makes any sense.<eos> Maybe she'll talk to you.
He wants me to come on as HUD secretary.<eos> What?<eos> He said he was really taken by my housing initiative in Bedford Park and that he thought his cabinet could use fresh ideas like mine.<eos> Well, y-y-you said yes, right?<eos> No, I wanted to talk to you about it.
This is a list of all the Kirkmans' family and friends.<eos> Please call them so they're not hearing things from the TV.<eos> - I'm also going to need Comms...<eos> - Emily,<eos> - I'm gonna need a word with you, please.
I'm not at liberty to discuss this.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - You're not at...<eos> What the... What the hell is that supposed to mean?<eos> It means I can't talk about this with you.
And right now, the president needs a legal advisor who's above reproach.<eos> What you're asking is just a little above my pay grade.<eos> Well, it's above all of our pay grades.<eos> What we're talking about is completely unprecedented.<eos> But the president needs counsel, and I might have already told him that we can count on you.
What?<eos> Minutes before you got shot,<eos> Emily found out that it was Aaron who made that call to the Pentagon.<eos> What?<eos> Why the hell is Emily talking to you about stuff like this?
This is unbelievable.<eos> I mean, the resources involved and the planning... a conspiracy that reaches all the way to the vice president.<eos> I'm sorry I doubted you.<eos> It's not just the bureau.<eos> The whole country owes you a great debt.
I also knew this is how they got you to confess to Nassar's murder.<eos> Jason, take your statement back.<eos> Tell me everything you know.<eos> Listen to me... If they know<eos> - that I'm cooperating with you...
Who knows?<eos> Did I ever tell you about how I got my first job at the White House?<eos> Harvard Lampoon connection.<eos> I told you?<eos> Seth, nobody can have a personal conversation with you without Harvard coming up, usually within the first 30 seconds.
We were betrayed, remember?<eos> We had to defend ourselves.<eos> We did what we had to do to save each other.<eos> This new office I'm in, I mean,<eos> I can't be making visits like this anymore, so I need to know... can I count on you?
I am so sorry.<eos> I so did not mean to step on your announcement.<eos> It was an honest mistake.<eos> Hell, it wasn't even a mistake.<eos> I mean, you know I agree with you.
Do you need more time?<eos> No, we're fine.<eos> We're done here.<eos> Thank you, Mike.<eos> Lily, I'll be right with you.
Give me a break.<eos> I called you for a comment.<eos> Yeah, and you buried it under four graphs of innuendo.<eos> Look, I-I want to see both sides of the story.<eos> And the Speaker's willing to sit with you... an exclusive.
Where is Mommy?<eos> Upstairs, helping Leo with his homework.<eos> Want me to go get her?<eos> No.<eos> No, I want to talk to you.
Come in.<eos> Abe Leonard, Alyssa Abboud.<eos> Uh, are we here to discuss promotional opportunities?<eos> Actually, Alyssa's from Legal.<eos> The FBI wants to talk to you.
True enough.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What for?<eos> For standing by me. Well... you didn't give me much choice.<eos> If you go down, I go down with you.
I'd like you back here at the White House.<eos> This is where you belong.<eos> I appreciate the gesture, Mr. President, but... my position's been filled.<eos> And Emily's doing a fantastic job.<eos> I couldn't agree with you more.
And I make my judgments after careful thought and consideration, after weighing all sides.<eos> But back at the farm, in a moment like that...<eos> You don't have time to think.<eos> How do you reconcile it?<eos> You don't. You just carry it with you for the next time.
The delegates all seem to regard the Army as if a child and one that should neither be seen nor heard.<eos> Yet come quickly when called.<eos> I'll be able to show you around, let you make a full assessment in light of recent events.<eos> And General Washington?<eos> Yes, His Excellency hopes to speak with you as well.
Well, she wouldn't be here if she didn't.<eos> Of course.<eos> But she is your wife, Selah.<eos> She's...<eos> If you wish to take her back to Philadelphia with you, then, well, that is your prerogative, of course.
- Previously on Stitchers...<eos> You have a sister.<eos> Her name's Ivy Brown.<eos> Your mother is still alive.<eos> I shared information with you that I promised to keep secret.
I'm not leaving.<eos> This is no place for you.<eos> If you... stay here, you will die.<eos> I don't care.<eos> I want to be with you forever.
I don't care.<eos> I want to be with you forever.<eos> Entanglement is holding.<eos> Say it.<eos> Well, I don't want to be with you.
I...<eos> I thought you hated me.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Uh... about that.<eos> I was just mad at you, but... feels like a pretty long time ago.
Blair wants to kill your mother.<eos> Do not trust him.<eos> Find out where she is, and find a way to tell me.<eos> Together, we can save her.<eos> I'm counting on you, sweetheart.
Wake up, man.<eos> - What?<eos> - Goodbye.<eos> What are you, fucking nuts?<eos> Oh, yeah, that's real funny coming from you.
S-So what are you going to do with it?<eos> I'm going to put it on the market.<eos> I'm sure it'll go pretty quick.<eos> This neighborhood's on the rise.<eos> So it's not going to be for you?
So it's not going to be for you?<eos> I got my dream house in escrow, KD.<eos> I don't mind if you stay here until it sells.<eos> I appreciate that.<eos> Hey, I, um... - This is for you. - Hmm.
‚ô´ All you need is faith ‚ô´<eos> ‚ô´ To hear the diesels humming ‚ô´<eos> ‚ô´ Don't need no ticket ‚ô´<eos> ‚ô´ You just thank the Lord ‚ô´<eos> You said they didn't know if they were after you?
‚ô´ Don't need no ticket ‚ô´<eos> ‚ô´ You just thank the Lord ‚ô´<eos> You said they didn't know if they were after you?<eos> Look at these.<eos> They're after you.
Excuse me.<eos> Hey, Keith, what are you doing here?<eos> I was- - I wondered if I could talk with Reverend Paul.<eos> Oh, he's working on his sermon right now, and now is not really a good time.<eos> Okay, Well, maybe I could just ask you.
I need to know where you stand.<eos> You're going to have to choose between boosting your career or having to destroy me, what would you do?<eos> I mean, we all got to make hard choices, like rolling the hard 6, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> If I discover something about you that I knew would destroy you, I wouldn't use it.
You got blood on your hand.<eos> Here we are, Mrs. Harris.<eos> I'll take care of this in no time.<eos> I don't suppose you want to shoot a rack.<eos> If anything gets shot in here, it's going to be you.
- I need to talk to her.<eos> - Call her. She's like you. She doesn't answer.<eos> She needs space.<eos> From me?<eos> Not just you.
- I can't do that.<eos> You're gonna need these things.<eos> Baby's gonna need these things.<eos> I don't want anything from Pernell.<eos> That includes you.
Excuse me?<eos> What are you lookin' at?<eos> Pernell, I don't have time for this.<eos> I love Mommy and Daddy.<eos> I made it for you.
You will?<eos> Yeah, I will.<eos> You can do anything, kid.<eos> Anything.<eos> I believe in you.
Try the chair.<eos> It's engineered to stimulate thought and creativity.<eos> Nah, yeah.<eos> No, I'm more of a think the shower type.<eos> This morning I was in the shower thinkin' about you.
This is why you came here.<eos> I- - I don't-- I don't want to--<eos> - I don't want to read this, I--<eos> - Jocelyn.<eos> - No. - He wrote it for you.
[sobbing] No, I can't.<eos> I can't.<eos> What did you find out?<eos> [scoffs] How about a "How are you?"<eos> "I know this has been tough on you as well."
Come on. Don't fight us. Don't fight us!<eos> - Fuck you!<eos> - Don't fuckin' fight us!<eos> - Fuck you!<eos> - This doesn't go right, we'll bring your wife here, we'll shoot her right in front of you.
- Don't fuckin' fight us!<eos> - Fuck you!<eos> - This doesn't go right, we'll bring your wife here, we'll shoot her right in front of you.<eos> You don't fuckin' touch her.<eos> We will fuckin' shoot her in front of you.
Is he serious?<eos> He's got trust issues.<eos> What's this?<eos> A video.<eos> You killing my son.
I want you to make sure that my murder trial goes away.<eos> You're feelin' pretty good right now.<eos> I'm feelin' like I want to hurt you really bad right now.<eos> But I'll settle for this.<eos> I got a surprise for you, too.
We've got a problem.<eos> Stalemate.<eos> You're gonna make sure my murder trial goes away.<eos> 'Cause if I go to prison, I can't see any reason why that video doesn't make the light of day.<eos> If anything happens to me... after I do this for you, your confession goes straight to McCauley.
You'll have it.<eos> I knew you'd find a way to pull it out.<eos> - You always do.<eos> - Thank you, Bobo.<eos> Yeah. Couldn't have done it without you.
But this someone happened to be managing all my money.<eos> You should call Judge Harris.<eos> How many times do I have to tell you no?<eos> I'll figure it out.<eos> He cares about you.
Oh, Crystal, I saw the, uh--<eos> Oh, Jocelyn.<eos> - How've you been?<eos> Better.<eos> Oh, what can I do for you Nathan?
Oh, Jocelyn.<eos> - How've you been?<eos> Better.<eos> Oh, what can I do for you Nathan?<eos> Oh, well, I just came by to congratulate you and Pernell.
I want you to keep that for me.<eos> No, I'm not getting involved.<eos> You're already involved, Paul.<eos> God involved you the day you baptized me.<eos> You thought you were using me... but God was using you... despite your selfish intentions.
I've been wandering around hopelessly for the last 20 minutes.<eos> - Deal.<eos> - All right.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Thank you.
Okay, I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry it came down to this.<eos> And I'm not sorry I did it.<eos> You broke my fucking heart, Pernell.<eos> I trusted you.
Now, either you blend into the background, or I'm gonna fucking destroy you.<eos> "Blend." Oh, I like that.<eos> You should take stock before you start making threats.<eos> Times have changed.<eos> You survived. That's good for you.
And the tide hadn't receded yet, so I waited in there, and there it was.<eos> It was in a cigar box sealed with candle wax.<eos> Let me get dressed. We'll go home.<eos> I'm- - I'm not going back to San Vicente, Crystal.<eos> I don't know if I did this for you or for P.J., but it wasn't for me.
Buy thank you.<eos> Wait.<eos> Thank you for loving my son.<eos> I'll take 40 on--<eos> I'm really proud of you.
I mean, this is something.<eos> [chuckles] I mean, I've heard the stories about how crazy you are, but actually seeing it?<eos> Seeing it firsthand?<eos> I mean, it's truly astonishing.<eos> So... I'm gonna give you back that fancy tear catcher you gave me, 'cause you're gonna need it more than me.
The Fascists could be in Barcelona by now, but they use the ARAGON front to make the war drag on.<eos> The longer it takes, the greater the triumph.<eos> And we get to die of boredom.<eos> But smelling of soap!<eos> Not you!
Here.<eos> Put these greens on to boil.<eos> - And the potatoes?<eos> - No, there aren't any.<eos> I have something for you too.
I have something for you too.<eos> Is that a Christmas tree?<eos> I keep them.<eos> They're like treasure.<eos> If it wasn't for you...
Tired, Trini.<eos> I want to leave this world, or get married, and read fairy tales.<eos> - Why don't you then?<eos> - No woman could love me. You?<eos> You're made to make some woman happy.
- Don't be an animal.<eos> - An animal? Me?<eos> Yes, you!<eos> Animal!<eos> I can talk to you like a brother.
Where do you think he is?<eos> I don't care.<eos> You don't care if he's dead or alive?<eos> No, I don't.<eos> And neither should you.
No. In a Fascist uniform and aiming at us, Trini.<eos> That irresponsible liar is now a traitor.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> It's the truth about your friend.<eos> Why should I believe you, when you've lied to me?
You'd hate me for what I can't give you, like I hate Llu√≠s now.<eos> - Don't talk about Llu√≠s. - I can't.<eos> He humiliated me.<eos> He stopped respecting me, but I can't stop loving him.<eos> Llu√≠s might be weak, but he'll always take care of you and Ramonet.
- Sit down.<eos> - Don't touch him.<eos> - You...<eos> Hey. Shh.<eos> I told you, brother, if you don't come to your parole officer, your parole officer will come to you.
You got to do what you say you're going to do, which you haven't.<eos> Spike, come on, man.<eos> You know the terms of your parole strictly prohibit use of illegal substances.<eos> I... I got a prescription for that.<eos> Good for you, sweetie.
You've got one chance.<eos> You meet me in my office today at 2:00 p.m. not 2:01, not 2:03 but 2:00 p.m.<eos> Now say it back to me.<eos> - 2 p.m.<eos> - Or I will violate you.
I don't put it in the safe.<eos> Audrey does.<eos> You can't get in the safe?<eos> - Only Audrey.<eos> - She doesn't trust you?
Roger that, gunny.<eos> Someday.<eos> Naomi: So, other than being blasted by 50 times the lethal limit of radiation, you're doing surprisingly well.<eos> Who knows, maybe you'll develop superpowers that you can use.<eos> That'd be perfect for you.
I just... I just want them dead.<eos> Hey.<eos> I never did say it, but thanks.<eos> For getting me off Eros.<eos> I wouldn't have made it without you.
Briefing in five.<eos> I think I hear something.<eos> Violins.<eos> Schubert in d-minor.<eos> I think the lieutenant has the hots for you, Bobbie.
My Julie.<eos> Even losing her was worth it.<eos> She's a sacred part of it now.<eos> So don't talk to me about sacrifice ever again.<eos> Naomi: This'll kill any cancer that dares try to grow inside you.
I had nothing against him. I thought he was a decent guy.<eos> -Decent guy? -Yeah.<eos> Do you think you would've got off Eros without him?<eos> -No. -Ah.<eos> But he wasn't a good enough friend to wait for you.
Oh, I get it.<eos> I think.<eos> You're, uh... Kind of like his guide star, right?<eos> Lighting the way, and all, through the dark.<eos> Like Julie is to you.
Command,beadvised, wearestandingdown.<eos> Themartiansweretargeting Phoeberesearchstation, whichsustained multipledirecthits.<eos> Theicemoonfractured underthebarrage andthefragmentsspiraled intosaturn.<eos> It'scompletelygone.<eos> Miller: Wish I had your hat for you, amigo.
I wish.<eos> - Hey, Carrie.<eos> - Hi. Is Reda in yet?<eos> Haven't seen him.<eos> Some flowers came for you, though.
Ha. Are you high?<eos> Sekou Bah cleared and released by tomorrow morning, or this goes to the Attorney General.<eos> Saul.<eos> Been too long.<eos> I'll admit, I was surprised to hear from you.
- Where are the baby wipes?<eos> Right there in front of him.<eos> Huggies.<eos> White wrapper. Right there.<eos> Right there, right in front of you.
Looking for some clue.<eos> There.<eos> It was those tiles.<eos> Those are what...<eos> what led me to you.
Then stop the bad advice.<eos> How can you be so sure. Iran's not building a bomb in North Korea?<eos> I can't, but neither can you be so sure they are.<eos> And that's the point, isn't it?<eos> I came to you as a friend, Carrie, an admirer even, and I'm telling you this in the same spirit...
I was visiting my sister.<eos> Whom you haven't seen in more than a decade, and who gets the pleasure of your company for less than a day.<eos> Because I have to get back to the States.<eos> I'm on the transition team.<eos> I'm afraid the President-elect will have to do without you for a while.
For what?<eos> Exposing an FBI informant, for one thing.<eos> That asshole?<eos> He deserves what's comin'.<eos> It's you I'm worried about.
You're 20 years old and angry, so I'm gonna forgive you for saying that.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I told you, take down the video.<eos> Can't do that.<eos> You leave it up, and you're just waving a red flag in front of the FBI and thumbing your nose at all the people who believed in you.
What now?<eos> Tovah will be here in the morning.<eos> In the morning.<eos> It's like that, is it?<eos> You fuck with us, we fuck with you.
I got car payments.<eos> I want the truth.<eos> You think you can find that somewhere in that head of yours?<eos> He looks like government, man.<eos> He looks like you.
It took me an hour to get out here on that stinking train.<eos> Why not just meet at the Rezidentura?<eos> Viktor.<eos> L'chaim.<eos> There were whispers all last year about you.
Viktor.<eos> L'chaim.<eos> There were whispers all last year about you.<eos> Trouble in Berlin.<eos> I expected to hear from you.
Trouble in Berlin.<eos> I expected to hear from you.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Now you have.<eos> I didn't say I wanted to hear from you.
I'd like to keep these.<eos> Now it's my turn to say "no."<eos> The question is... what do we do now?<eos> - We? - Yes.<eos> This puts us in a bad situation... you and me.
What's she make of it?<eos> The bombing?<eos> I'd say she's still processing.<eos> You could tell, though, she's... not chastened, exactly, but a little more open.<eos> Open to you.
Army?<eos> Marines?<eos> I served.<eos> I did, too.<eos> Good for you.
A bomb has been planted.<eos> An FBI agent is dead.<eos> I-I don't know who these people are, but they are serious.<eos> And they're connected.<eos> I'm worried about you.
Feeling sorry for yourself?<eos> Go fuck yourself, Dar.<eos> Because if you are, that would be a first.<eos> You grew up in a hard school, no time for self-pity.<eos> It's the first thing about you that impressed.
What's so important you have to get back to New York?<eos> Astrid mentioned on the phone you were talking about the attack.<eos> The bomb that went off...<eos> Why are you so interested?<eos> What's it to you?
It's Carrie Mathison.<eos> Her foundation represented the bomber.<eos> She's what's pulling you back to New York, isn't that it?<eos> No.<eos> The sway she holds over you... and Saul, I'll never understand...
She was wrong.<eos> W-What risks?<eos> The main one was massive cerebral hemorrhage.<eos> Stroke.<eos> You think she's been taking care of you all these months out of love?
I also just spent 90 minutes with a shrink reminding me how I put people in harm's way without thinking twice.<eos> Well, I've already had a Skype interview with a recruiter.<eos> They want me to come in this afternoon.<eos> - Max...<eos> - It's not on you.
They said it couldn't be done.<eos> The President-Elect could not be moved.<eos> That's what they said.<eos> But she has been, finally.<eos> And I owe it all to you.
It goes a long way in, what is it, Costa Rica?<eos> I think I'll keep my retirement plans to myself.<eos> - No offense.<eos> - None taken.<eos> I have a lot of people angry at me thanks to you.
Oh, I was unable to mention this earlier, but our partners at Mossad came to me when they found out you were in the country.<eos> I said "Leave him alone." He's got important work to do."<eos> Which I did.<eos> I kept my part of the bargain.<eos> Now it's time for you to keep yours!
- No!<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> - Hurry.<eos> I should have never trusted you!
I mean, if there is ever anything I can--<eos> I said I'm fine.<eos> It was really great seeing you again.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Uh, yeah, you too.
What would embolden Dar Adal to make such an extreme recommendation, and why now?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> Come on, Carrie.<eos> You know exactly why.<eos> He found out you were advising me, and he got to you, just like he got to Majid Javadi before.
Then don't ask me questions you know I can't answer.<eos> And don't show up here with a platoon of armed men and tell yourself you're not trying to strong-arm me, too.<eos> - Now, I was just leaving.<eos> - So that's it.<eos> This is all fine with you.
I follow the news, and I can read between the lines.<eos> This is about the president-elect, isn't it?<eos> It's related.<eos> The intelligence community hates her.<eos> And you're caught in the middle.
- What?<eos> You'll go to prison?<eos> Probably cut a deal.<eos> But I'll be humiliated-- publicly.<eos> When has that ever made the slightest bit of fucking difference to you?
You're still out there going a million miles an hour.<eos> You will hit a wall.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Damn it.<eos> I'm worried about you.
Well, maybe I don't like the idea of you worrying about me anymore.<eos> You can go right in.<eos> - Carrie.<eos> - Madam President.<eos> David and I were just speaking about you.
I've said it before.<eos> There's something dogmatic and dangerous, something distinctly un-American.<eos> Anyway.<eos> Another lesson learned... in a long life of lessons.<eos> Tell me, is there anything I can do for you?
- He must have taken...<eos> Rudy.<eos> Rudy.<eos> You're late.<eos> Brett had to start without you.
But you can't let us down.<eos> I'm...<eos> Look at those guys over there.<eos> Look.<eos> They are here because of you, because you had the guts to speak out.
I know the solicitor general.<eos> I met him through the president-elect.<eos> He can make things happen, secure the evidence, get that guy in there arrested, the whole bunch of them.<eos> Don't... call anyone.<eos> The van is from me to you.
You're gonna get out of this.<eos> We both are.<eos> What are you looking at?<eos> You want to tell me?<eos> What do these letters look like to you?
You're just kind of wandering around, and, like, we just throw you in the mix.<eos> It's so weird how life works, 'cause, like, I never swimsuit shop, and I just bought two new bathing suits.<eos> Also, I read Shailene Woodley likes to go to a private area, open her vagina, let the sun in, and that's how she gets her glow.<eos> So, when she goes to, like, "Insurgent" premiere, that's not makeup, that's sun in her pussy.<eos> And good morning to you.
Baby, I'm not gonna be in your way.<eos> Do your thang.<eos> No, I just... I... I can't have you sleeping at my place anymore every night.<eos> I've been talking about this a lot with my online therapist and she's, like, obsessed with the idea that this is just gonna be me getting back into all of my old routines.<eos> I am in the middle of a divorce right now, so this is not about you, this is all about me.
Everything is going to be okay.<eos> Come on, let's go!<eos> There's no time.<eos> You're gonna be all right, okay?<eos> We've got you.
There's no time.<eos> You're gonna be all right, okay?<eos> We've got you.<eos> Mag. That was quick.<eos> We were right behind you.
If things don't go well in that surgery, there will be time for that.<eos> But right now I'm gonna go in that room, and I'm gonna save your daughter's life.<eos> So your implant is hidden in the gluteal crust.<eos> Sounds like something you get at Pizza Hut.<eos> Which means, unfortunately, until the swelling goes down, we're not able to operate on you, Dustin, so...
Who is there?<eos> Name yourself.<eos> If you are on this land, you will know who I am.<eos> You will know not to harm me.<eos> The priest tells me it is you I must thank for my freedom.
A ransom was not paid, it goes back to the church.<eos> Some coins should go to them, the lepers.<eos> Without them, we'd all be dead.<eos> As I am apparently now a king, I shall see they are rewarded.<eos> This is for you.
Uh, I just came home to change a shirt.<eos> Oh. Sick of me already?<eos> I have to go to St. Louis for work.<eos> Oh. I'm gonna miss you.<eos> I'll miss you, too.
He had a new family.<eos> So, I wish they wouldn't have told me, because I was already where I belonged.<eos> Well, do you know what I wish?<eos> I wish you'd never left her for me.<eos> I didn't leave Lily for you, Nora.
You've stolen from these people.<eos> Really? I've stolen?<eos> Same way your government stole a whole generation of their children?<eos> We apologized for that!<eos> Shame on you, Sharon.
Gotcha.<eos> You brought your book.<eos> It's not my book.<eos> It's Matt's.<eos> But it's about you.
I'm leaving now.<eos> I don't understand what's happening.<eos> I think that you projected Evie onto a stranger.<eos> And I think you chose Evie because... you understood why she did what she did. Why she left her family. Why she escaped.<eos> I think a part of you wants to escape, Kevin.
Are you afraid you're gonna give that one away, too?<eos> You can't have a kid, because then you'd have no excuse.<eos> You couldn't be a victim anymore.<eos> You'd have to be okay.<eos> No one would feel sorry for you.
Three wise men.<eos> Hi, this is Kevin Garvey.<eos> Leave a message.<eos> I don't know if you're getting my messages, but I'm sure you're aware there's been a nuclear incident in the South Pacific, but I've secured transportation.<eos> I'm coming to get you, Kevin.
- You're immensely grateful?<eos> - Yes. But with all due respect, I'm not sure you entirely grasp what's happening here.<eos> Okay, three years ago, my ex-husband experienced severe delusions and tried to kill himself.<eos> And instead of acknowledging his mental illness, you turned it into fucking scripture.<eos> And when he found out about it, he relapsed and ran halfway around the world, probably to get the fuck away from you.
She's not picking up the phone either.<eos> But why would you know that?<eos> Because you're too busy chartering cargo planes to Australia.<eos> Tell me, Matt, does that seem reasonable to you?<eos> Well, it must seem reasonable to you since you're trying to get on it.
Right.<eos> Then let's get on the plane and work this out like civilized adults.<eos> When we find Kevin, you don't speak to him, okay?<eos> I will talk to him.<eos> He didn't call you.
Yahweh. Holy of holies.<eos> Voice of the Olympics.<eos> Red hat and a beard.<eos> Likes the top deck.<eos> But I'd steer clear if I were you.
To... to guide them.<eos> To ease their suffering even though I suffered myself.<eos> I sacrificed my happiness.<eos> - I let my family abandon me.<eos> - Why? For you!
Which husband?<eos> I heard you were with the good Reverend Jamison.<eos> He coming, too?<eos> No.<eos> He gave me something for you, though.
It was a horrible mistake, and I will be taking responsibility for what I've done.<eos> I'm not sure she understands.<eos> I understand.<eos> You want to drown Kevin so that he can go to this place where the dead people are.<eos> And while he's there, he's going to learn a song from one of the dead people and he's gonna bring that song back to you so you can sing it and stop the biblical flood that's gonna happen tomorrow.
Truth is, along with our missing fucking savior, we also appear to be short some apostles.<eos> Our friend Matthew conspicuously absent.<eos> Fortunately, I will play the part of Peter.<eos> You are already John.<eos> What about you, kid?
- Dad, stop.<eos> Let's go.<eos> You okay?<eos> I'm cold.<eos> If I could do this instead of you, I would.
Well, if you knew that, why the fuck wouldn't you tell me?<eos> Because I'm covering my asset.<eos> - What asset?<eos> - I have someone on the inside.<eos> Leave your weapon, enter the door, and they'll take care of you once you're inside.
And please make sure you fucking kill the Secretary of Defense.<eos> - Where's the comms room? - What?<eos> The comms room.<eos> I need to make a call.<eos> Do you know what's inside of you?
No.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Because a man calling himself that came by yesterday.<eos> He had a photo.<eos> A photo of you.
- Because if you did, just say so, and I...<eos> - I didn't.<eos> We established boundaries the first time you called me.<eos> Clear boundaries.<eos> I don't tell you about the people here, and I don't tell the people here about you.
And I told him it's because I didn't belong there.<eos> So, he built it.<eos> And I came back through.<eos> I came back here.<eos> Did I... think about you?
It's something much bigger than us.<eos> Okay.<eos> Shit.<eos> And your path became clear.<eos> I just wish you could understand what I'm trying to do for you.
How you abused the gifts he gave you and then you pay your penance.<eos> Please.<eos> Don't hurt me.<eos> Please.<eos> I'll do anything for you.
Where the fuck have you been?<eos> I told you to stay in the house.<eos> I could really use your help right now.<eos> It's so cold.<eos> How am I supposed to do this without you?
That's why the first thing she asked for the moment those gates closed behind her was Max.<eos> That's how valuable she could be to us.<eos> And you wanna trade that away for 20 men?<eos> Those 20 men are your brothers.<eos> Those men's lives mean as much to me as they do to you.
You told me once that the people he holds closest are the most at risk of being consumed by him.<eos> And he and I have discussed it at length.<eos> So, I thank you for your concern.<eos> But I'm going to be just fine.<eos> And I'm not talking about you.
Every fight I have ever won... every death I have escaped, every sacrifice I have had bled out of me, it will all have to be repeated just to get things back to where they were a few hours ago.<eos> There's some kind of hell it seems to me to be.<eos> But I want you to know, at the first opportunity, I will see you returned back home.<eos> I gave you my word. I intend to honor it.<eos> This fight ahead does not belong to you, nor to your children.
Move!<eos> I would think some sort of thanks might be in order.<eos> Billy was more than ready to throw you to the wolves out there.<eos> And to be honest, I was undecided about whether to go through with this deal at all.<eos> Sure.. I get my men back in exchange for you.
When you and I last saw each other... you had every reason to see me killed.<eos> Certainly would've solved a lot of problems for you.<eos> And yet you didn't.<eos> Why?<eos> You know, I've had a rough few days owing to you.
Ma'am.<eos> Again, please.<eos> Reload.<eos> I beg your pardon, my lord, but she demanded that I relay what follows... Her words precisely... In spite of any protest you offered.<eos> She says she knows that you will be angry and that this will be hard for you to understand... but she said...
Where are you going?<eos> I have a siege to manage, for which I'm going to need Billy's help.<eos> Wait!<eos> Billy was your friend.<eos> This is not easy for me, but I know it is harder for you.
Don't forget that I know that.<eos> I haven't.<eos> If this goes away, Flint's war, if it all ended and we had to walk away from it...<eos> Walk away?<eos> Would I be enough for you?
I had concerns when we first arrived in Nassau, and I told her as much... that the instincts that had allowed her to survive for so long there, to thrive there, would eventually return.<eos> And that when they did, it would cause conflict between us.<eos> I don't believe that's what's happened, my lord.<eos> You don't?<eos> She's done this out of devotion to you.
A rational man to lead Nassau.<eos> That's the first in recent memory.<eos> And one that they'd allow to lead them into a rational future...<eos> This doesn't have anything to do with reason, and you know it.<eos> You want them following me only to the extent that I, in turn, will follow you.
That you wouldn't use your men to force a scenario by which he ends up dead?<eos> I'm not gonna stand by and watch while all our futures are destroyed.<eos> No.<eos> But perhaps it's worth focusing on how hard I'm working to persuade you not to make that decision.<eos> I would far, far rather do this with you than against you.
Why are you not in Williamsburg or Kingston seeking help from your own?<eos> I've tried.<eos> They won't listen.<eos> Maybe because they care more about the war against Spain than I do.<eos> Maybe because this just isn't as personal to them as it is for me or for you.
All those men out there that you and I have fought alongside.<eos> I can't believe I'm the only one who knows this isn't right.<eos> You built all of this.<eos> The resistance.<eos> It wouldn't have worked without you.
What do you see out there?<eos> I watched him defeat Edward Teach in battle... outnumbered and through sheer force of will.<eos> I saw his bloodlust with my own eyes.<eos> That man will never surrender his position here.<eos> He will never allow himself to be defeated by you or I.
It's shaped like an arrow.<eos> Kimmy, this man put you through hell... cheating on you or whatever.<eos> -He kidnapped me.<eos> -I said, "Or whatever."<eos> But now he wants something from you, right?
You're talking to K-Biz.<eos> Allah, be praised, K-Biz.<eos> You got your phone back.<eos> It was hard to track down 'cause I went to so many places today.<eos> I just love walking wherever I want, don't you?
Get really low.<eos> Hey, it's me, man, Lonny Dufrene.<eos> I had, like, a far out idea for the new Gordon--<eos> Titus Andromedon.<eos> I bet he's never heard of you either, lady!
And I'm making it worse.<eos> I bet your cell's pretty small.<eos> My apartment's so big, I can- - Gosh dang it!<eos> Why don't our shins have butts?<eos> I know it seems like you're just having fun, but you let someone back in your life who's-- who's bad for you.
It's holding you back.<eos> Who, me?<eos> No, that's not what's happening here.<eos> 'Cause it's different than it used to be.<eos> Not everything's about you, dear.
No, Lillian, maybe this was always about Kimmy, all of it.<eos> Maybe I let a bad person back in my life, but he used to torture me. Now I'm torturing him.<eos> Hey, you know I'm still here, right?<eos> Are you talking to someone else?<eos> Man, maybe you're the one that should have the prison nickname "Rude Dude."
Okay, fine.<eos> Just initial where it says "uncontested" and then sign at the bottom.<eos> And then I can use this pen to apply to college.<eos> College?<eos> Good for you.
Have you lost your mind?<eos> - Keith, listen to me.<eos> - No, let me out of here, now!<eos> I can't do that.<eos> Not until I know if I can trust you.
Eric, that's not true.<eos> I should have benched Grimes on the Bin-Khalid raid.<eos> Rebecca, he was messed up before the mission, okay?<eos> He started talking crazy about this conspiracy and that conspiracy...<eos> I just... I should have reported it, brought it to you, but I covered for him, I just...
Aisha doesn't seem too happy I'm here.<eos> Well, me and Aisha have been having problems for a while.<eos> Yeah, well, maybe I'm making things worse.<eos> Nah.<eos> It's not you.
Hey.<eos> Look at me.<eos> You have to finish mixing the explosives.<eos> Have you forgotten what these people did to you?<eos> What they said about you with those other students?
- Sit down.<eos> Make transcripts available to the press and if anyone asks about Rebecca Ingram's absence just refer them to me.<eos> Nilaa.<eos> Can you excuse us for a moment?<eos> Gage's campaign is releasing an attack ad tomorrow... about you.
I guess I just convinced myself it happened so long ago no one would ever find out.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I will, uh, I'll draft my letter of resignation and explain how I kept...<eos> I won't accept your resignation.<eos> It's true you should have told me... but it's also true that I wouldn't be here if it weren't for you.
I told him I've explained everything to you and you believed it.<eos> Did Drew believe it?<eos> I knew you were lying to me.<eos> He was the one you were texting? !<eos> I was beginning to think this was gonna happen without you.
!<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Rebecca respects you.<eos> It's not about not trusting you.
I think they'd appreciate my loyalty.<eos> Oh, let me take this, it's Rebecca.<eos> Ask her what she thinks.<eos> I will.<eos> Everyone's been asking after you, darling.
I'm fine, baby.<eos> Listen, this whole thing with Ben is winding down, and we cleared the guy running CTU.<eos> Does that mean we can go home?<eos> Soon.<eos> I'm-a come get you, and... we can start to put this whole thing behind us. Okay?
- I'll get someone on it for you.<eos> This is Agent Locke.<eos> He's the best tactical specialist in CTU.<eos> He'll be leading the field team.<eos> Now, we have no way of knowing how Grimes will approach you at the station.
Rebecca's already pulled the footage, and she has a record that Nilaa was at campaign headquarters when her file was breached.<eos> And there are no other cameras?<eos> There's no way that CTU can confirm Nilaa's story?<eos> I went over the route myself, twice.<eos> CTU won't be able to trace the leak back to you.
We need to hit her hard, get something out of her<eos> - we can use.<eos> - Understood.<eos> I want to finish questioning her, Keith.<eos> Right now, I need something else from you.
A couple of times.<eos> Well, probably more like three, but who's counting, right?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I never had the chance to say how sorry I am, about the men.<eos> I know they were like brothers to you.
What, you already went through them?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I tweaked some parameters, so you're good to go.<eos> Can thank me later.<eos> I know you think Mullins is looking to get rid of you.
- Mullins?<eos> Eric... are you hearing what you want to hear from Grimes, convincing yourself you can trust him?<eos> Why would I do that?<eos> Because you blame yourself for what happened today.<eos> Look, Rebecca, I told you and Mullins what I think.
- ...information from my friend...<eos> Think about what you're doing, now.<eos> - Don't you realize...<eos> - ...at the NSA, to see if CTU...<eos> I did it for you.
How?<eos> I told him everything.<eos> You'll deny it.<eos> Unless he was wearing a wire...<eos> - ...there is no hard evidence linking you or me to anything.
I want your team ready to intercept once we locate Carter and Grimes.<eos> It's him.<eos> Put him on speaker.<eos> Eric, I'm here with Keith Mullins.<eos> Turn around now before this gets any worse for you.
- Still?<eos> I thought it was almost over.<eos> Yeah, I... I thought so, too.<eos> Eric, what is going on?<eos> Listen, I want you to go to Christine's, and I'm gonna come get you as soon as I can, okay?
Is that kharcho?<eos> It smells just like your mother's.<eos> Always reminds me of home.<eos> Mmm. So good.<eos> And what about you?
I know you helped Carter access the Onyx schematics.<eos> You have no proof of that.<eos> Only because you're good at what you do.<eos> Which means I can't fire you for cause... yet.<eos> But I don't trust you.
But you're losing them.<eos> You're out of control.<eos> You'll end up making them do something they'd never think of doing.<eos> Like what?<eos> If you keep going like this... they're gonna turn on you.
Rebecca, you know me, we're family.<eos> We've spent Christmases together.<eos> You and John were married in my backyard.<eos> Now do you honestly think that I would cooperate with terrorists, that I would help them to kill servicemen?<eos> Does that make any sense to you at all?
An operation Eric Carter is running has turned up a promising lead.<eos> We may be able to find Jadalla without your father's help.<eos> CTU's launching an operation.<eos> Keith's asked if I'll oversee it with him.<eos> I don't know if it's you that can't do without this place or them who can't do without you.
Oh, is that what it would take to get you to stay, hmm?<eos> This is the only thing I know how to do.<eos> You don't know what you can do until you try.<eos> You're smart, Isaac.<eos> You know, I got faith in you.
And now I take his place.<eos> No, he's not...<eos> No, wait, wait...<eos> He and I will be together again soon.<eos> And someone will find you.
And then, we die.<eos> Which seems... I don't know... Like a waste of a perfectly good virus.<eos> Andy, you talk a lot when you're stressed.<eos> Look, you'll figure it out.<eos> I have faith in you, man.
You got three seconds.<eos> What the hell are you doing here?<eos> You left CTU with your laptop and your development kit in the middle of a terrorist event.<eos> That's not normal behavior.<eos> Even for you.
Where's Nicole?<eos> Isaac.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Isaac.<eos> I was worried about you.
- I'm sorry.<eos> - Nicole.<eos> - No!<eos> Get her to CTU.<eos> Isaac'll take care of you.
You're going to walk my friend through every program you have on this laptop.<eos> You understand?<eos> Isaac, we have to go back.<eos> Try to help Eric.<eos> Eric told me to take care of you, so that's what I'm doing.
Maybe you want him gone.<eos> Why would you say something crazy like that?<eos> Because I've never known you to run.<eos> And that's what you're doing, you're turning your back on your brother.<eos> You know if you ever needed him, he would be there for you.
Why would you say something crazy like that?<eos> Because I've never known you to run.<eos> And that's what you're doing, you're turning your back on your brother.<eos> You know if you ever needed him, he would be there for you.<eos> No matter what Eric had to do, he would be there for you.
How soon until you're ready?<eos> We're close, we're almost done with his medical screens.<eos> How far away is your husband?<eos> Minutes.<eos> I've been able to learn about you.
It's not like that, John.<eos> I look at you and I don't even know who you are anymore.<eos> We have to go back.<eos> Try to help Eric.<eos> Eric told me to take care of you, so that's what I'm doing.
He was desperate.<eos> Not that I'm justifying what he did.<eos> I'm-I'm not, but...<eos> Desperation can make you do terrible things.<eos> And it can make you keep them from the people you love because because you don't want them to see that part of you.
Jennifer, I need to know why they did this to you.<eos> It's over?<eos> It's really over?<eos> It's over.<eos> Who were they leveraging you against?
Get it off, get it off!<eos> You've got ten seconds.<eos> Go!<eos> Move!<eos> Who were they leveraging you against?
When I left for Europe, I... I thought I was joining a better world.<eos> When I heard the Americans had murdered you, I... I couldn't rationalize their hypocrisy anymore.<eos> That is why you had to make your own journey.<eos> I'll never leave you again, Father.<eos> And I will never forsake you.
Yeah, same one.<eos> I'm still locked out.<eos> Director of national intelligence.<eos> I'm at the location.<eos> Right behind you.
Now do what I say, or my men will put a bullet in his head.<eos> I don't believe you'll do that.<eos> It's me you want.<eos> You told me yourself.<eos> My husband means nothing to you.
Yeah, come on.<eos> Look, I don't know if you found anything, but just have CTU check anyway.<eos> Roger that, sir.<eos> Senator.<eos> Rebecca talked about you, talked about you a lot, about your missions together.
Yeah, unfortunately.<eos> I've got every agency looking for her.<eos> It's our highest priority.<eos> But I'm calling you about something else.<eos> I have a job for you.
Grab this.<eos> Put pressure on it.<eos> Keep pressing.<eos> I was wrong, Eric.<eos> I shouldn't have come down on you like that before.
Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> Ara, I need you to stay in here while I take care of something. Okay?<eos> Those people...<eos> I'm gonna do everything I can to protect you, I promise, but I need you to go in here and don't make a sound, not until I come get you.
Without the girl, this never happened.<eos> Get ready.<eos> Hold it!<eos> Where's the girl?<eos> I'm gonna find the girl with or without you.
You'd rather die than expose your country's crimes?<eos> It wasn't my country.<eos> It was me.<eos> God willing, you will be punished for your crimes.<eos> And you for yours.
Director Mullins.<eos> Okay, go see Mr. Hammad.<eos> Hello, Ara.<eos> I'm Mr. Hammad.<eos> I'm gonna take care of you until your mother arrives.
I would have done it before if I had thought there was any way to keep you out of it.<eos> But you need to know this, son... whether I spend what's left of my life in or out of prison, I will pay for what I've done.<eos> But a son should not have to pay for his father's sins.<eos> And a husband shouldn't profit from his wife's death.<eos> You would be honoring her life by living yours the way she would've wanted you to.
You ok?<eos> Yeah.<eos> See you later.<eos> Hey, uh...<eos> Anytime you wanna talk, we're here for you.
Neither did you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, I guess we both dropped the ball there.<eos> Listen, I know we don't talk a lot, but I just want you to know that I'm here for you.<eos> And I'm here for you.
That he's alive at the end of whatever happens.<eos> You trust him?<eos> Flint.<eos> You've cast your lot with him.<eos> What does it matter to you?
I revered you.<eos> When you were told that my mother and I were dead, I have to believe that it affected you.<eos> You had just lost your mother.<eos> But if things were as I remember, my mother and I were your family, too.<eos> And yet, through all the years thereafter that my father cared for you... counseled you, labored for you... he never told you that we were alive.
"I betrayed you, Jack.<eos> "Tried to trade your life for my own personal gain.<eos> "Lied to Anne to her face about it.<eos> "Please, Jack. Beg of you. "Is there any way you can forgive me?"<eos> That was the general sense I had of what I might hear come from your mouth were I ever this close to you again.
And I do not wish to lie to you ever again.<eos> Leave.<eos> No.<eos> I am going to stay with you.<eos> I want to take care of you.
We have to assume the Spanish have men all across the island by now.<eos> Every hour we sit here is an hour closer to being sighted by them... if we haven't been sighted already.<eos> She saw Anne?<eos> We'll give them another hour, then we'll set sail.<eos> Seems a fair amount of resentment towards you these days.
And now you would start another that no man can hope to finish?<eos> Then leave.<eos> But what's happening here is going to happen.<eos> This war is going to begin.<eos> This camp is going to fight it with or without you.
I just can't.<eos> It has to mean... something.<eos> When I was drowning over Miranda... you helped me find my way out.<eos> Look at me.<eos> I will do the same for you.
She's alive.<eos> Who else knows about this?<eos> No one.<eos> I summoned only the two of you.<eos> My daughter is everything to me, as I believe she is to you.
And as far as he and I go, it's not as if he wouldn't do the same to me were the roles reversed.<eos> Jack, how are you gonna do that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'll have to find him, get through the army of maroons he calls allies, get through Long John Silver and the animal whose leash he now holds.<eos> And somehow escape it all alive... all without you.
And we will find her and we will bring her home.<eos> You're confident in his plan maybe because it's a good plan.<eos> But maybe you'll have to show him that you're prepared for the failure and that a treasure he wanted left in the ground... ain't in the ground no more.<eos> Seemed only fair that I remind you that our fates are now linked.<eos> If this plan to secure the cache ends badly for me, you can be certain it will end badly for you.
Well outside any established trade route.<eos> It's been used from time to time for transactions neither party wished would ever be acknowledged.<eos> Of course I love her.<eos> I let you try it your way!<eos> I did trust you.
The only male heir to his family's banking operation.<eos> Supremely uncurious, bordering on dim, but fundamentally decent.<eos> The investments he's overseen have shown modest gains at best and losses more frequently.<eos> This is not the man you would like to put in charge of Nassau.<eos> I'd like to put you in charge of Nassau.
You are the bravest person I have ever known.<eos> The truest person I have ever known.<eos> And I betrayed you and it sickens me.<eos> I am so sorry for working so hard to protect the wrong things.<eos> For failing to see that there is nothing important that does not include you.
Can't you see it?<eos> After I just climbed that fucking hill, are you being serious right now?<eos> In a few weeks time, I will lead a pirate fleet of unprecedented strength over that horizon into a battle of unprecedented importance.<eos> With a little luck, that battle will end with us taking Nassau and beginning a revolution.<eos> I cannot do it without you.
I'm sorry, the more I try and dismiss this, I...<eos> You know my story.<eos> Thomas, Miranda, all of it.<eos> Know the role it played in motivating me to do the things that I've done, the things I will do.<eos> It has made me transparent to you.
But she'll keep on calling you.<eos> And when she does, you'll step into that painting and feel the swell beneath your feet.<eos> It'll all come back as if it were like yesterday.<eos> Is that so?<eos> I've watched you and yours handle the account since I and mine left it.
If I must compromise to avert a dark end, then so must you.<eos> I've offered you freedom for your people.<eos> I have offered you more than you have any right to expect.<eos> And still, you will not say yes.<eos> So I come to you one last time, to ensure you cannot say no.
- All hands!<eos> It would be preferable to me if we resolved this another way.<eos> Cache is in the ground by now.<eos> And I'll need as many men as we can get for what comes next.<eos> That includes you.
- Yeah.<eos> You won't need them.<eos> This isn't a trick, Will.<eos> That game's over for me.<eos> Thanks to you, I have the most secure position I've ever had in the organization.
And then something happened to me.<eos> Someone reminded me to look up.<eos> And I wanted to tell that someone thank you.<eos> I wanted to tell you that I love you.<eos> I love you.
Zakia, I'm a matatu driver.<eos> Which is exactly why you should run and why people would vote for you.<eos> I was at the protest.<eos> I saw the look on their faces.<eos> They trusted you, Capheus.
Where did you get those?<eos> Train station.<eos> Thought we could use them to cover the windows.<eos> Confuse anyone dropping in.<eos> Have I mentioned how in love with you I am?
Who's been beyond amazing.<eos> Like, approaching saint status.<eos> I would look good as a statue.<eos> I'm serious.<eos> I know I could not survive any of this crazy shit without you.
- Yeah.<eos> You won't need them.<eos> This isn't a trick, Will.<eos> That game's over for me.<eos> Thanks to you, I have the most secure position I've ever had in the organization.
And then something happened to me.<eos> Someone reminded me to look up.<eos> And I wanted to tell that someone thank you.<eos> I wanted to tell you that I love you.<eos> I love you.
I lost my Instagram followers, my Twitter followers.<eos> - I've lost...<eos> - Shut up!<eos> You have a man who loves you.<eos> And you have a friend who was willing to give up her life for you.
- Whoever's after you is probably after her.<eos> He's a good cop.<eos> It also means they're gonna come after anyone who tries to help us.<eos> What'd he say?<eos> He's just worried about you.
I need your advice.<eos> I know you know what's going on, how delicate the situation is.<eos> - It's not my business.<eos> - No.<eos> And I appreciate that about you, but... this is about Lila, and the way she talks about you.
See you later.<eos> I must go.<eos> I would like to continue this conversation.<eos> I'll find you.<eos> I know you're angry... but this is how a girl like me tells a boy like you that she has a crush on you.
Someone is listening to all the noise you make.<eos> - You and your lady should be careful.<eos> - Is this is a warning?<eos> Bossman don't do no warnings, Van Damn.<eos> He just comes for you.
Okay.<eos> It's happening again.<eos> I don't believe this.<eos> I know you're a little old-fashioned, Wolfgang.<eos> Some part of you thinks it should be the man who proposes to the woman, but... from the first moment our eyes touched, I could feel our fates were connected.

Because of Lila?<eos> I was surprised you came to the restaurant.<eos> Surprised?<eos> Why?<eos> Maybe everything would be easier for you if I wasn't...
Come here, I want you to meet our Jordi.<eos> This is Marc Jacobs, he's our designer.<eos> And Charlie.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Kit told us all about you.
You are a great actor.<eos> And you're scared right now because art, like life, is... is full of risk.<eos> And that's beautiful.<eos> But I will remind you... what you said to me when we were watching From Here to Eternity.<eos> That this wasn't a career you were chasing.
Don't do this, please!<eos> Don't do this!<eos> We have to get you out of here!<eos> Wait! What about my family?<eos> Your family is safer without you. Come on, let's go!
Oh, my God. What happened?<eos> I'm okay. I'm okay.<eos> What you said on that stage was good for people to hear.<eos> You were amazing.<eos> I want to grow up so I can vote for you.
Will you try to stop me?<eos> Do you want me to stop you?<eos> Every cop knows there are times where the only choice you have left... is to defend yourself.<eos> I missed my cop.<eos> He missed you.

That's him.<eos> - Quite handsome.<eos> - He's a genius.<eos> A biologist.<eos> - Too old for you.
Exactly.<eos> So you proposed to her?<eos> Bravo.<eos> Bravo...<eos> I've been doing it all for you.
They're are so young.<eos> They won't understand it.<eos> - Krzys thinks I'm his mother!<eos> - But you're not.<eos> - It'll be easier for you with one kid.
I didn't want to lose any of you.<eos> You only think about yourself.<eos> You've wasted her life!<eos> With you I always felt like a schoolgirl!<eos> I wanted the best for you.
- I don't smoke.<eos> You'll keep me company.<eos> Can I have this dance, boss?<eos> Of course...<eos> All the best to you!
He was away for almost a year.<eos> His heart...<eos> He had a strong heart.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I know it must be hard for you.
- I can.<eos> I'm so happy.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I need to repay you somehow.<eos> Can I do something for you?
When I get back, be gone.<eos> Case is terminated.<eos> Come work for Bach's firm on my account.<eos> I didn't hear "no."<eos> I am so sorry to have doubted you.
But right now, I do.<eos> You're lying.<eos> Covering.<eos> We all get complaints, right?<eos> Struggle for you is you remember the complaints, don't you?
I'd never sell him out.<eos> You passed the test.<eos> Ah. Do I get the whole chocolate factory now?<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> I thought I wanted to bring you on full time, but now that I know I can trust you, I'm certain I do.
It's to be admired in a sense, but that is the last time you use it today.<eos> I'm a man who could make things difficult for you, but I won't.<eos> As long as you'll understand this.<eos> Your next opponent is that boy.<eos> And I want him to have a very good time playing against you.
He did that after Marilyn was dead.<eos> Yours would have the same effect on me that his had on her.<eos> But I need you back at Axe Capital.<eos> Well, that's not gonna happen.<eos> Look, there are decisions I have to make over actions that I might take, and I have never had to do it without you.
Long before you became a banker or a trustee or whatever, Raul.<eos> Still more police than banker.<eos> - Good to see you.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I had good come-back about you from the school.
Now, it may not be a bribe, but, dang, if it doesn't look like one and smell like one.<eos> And if I put my tongue on it, I bet it tastes like one, too.<eos> Yum-bang. Now, I suppose you didn't know anything about that?<eos> If we're doing this, we're supposed to knock, - not just let ourselves in. - Uh-huh.<eos> I was gonna let the sitter get them ready for you.
I always knew I'd end up snared by Axelrod's money.<eos> It's poison.<eos> And you don't even need to ingest it for it to kill you.<eos> - Proximity is enough.<eos> - Well, good for you.
His father was the best there was.<eos> True master.<eos> Hall of Fame.<eos> Always finished top three.<eos> Oh, but to you, top three is never enough.
And that's a lesson you'll never have to learn more than once.<eos> It'll be tantamount to a class-action suit.<eos> Not so easy to ignore.<eos> Not possible to.<eos> The stories won't be about you anymore.
What did you see?<eos> Was it the girl?<eos> Did you see her first?<eos> What did you see?<eos> Or did she see you first?
I'm sleeping it off. Okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> No, no. I know you said it was the last time.<eos> I remember. But look, there's money in it for you.
But when he runs the name Marius Josepovich through the database...<eos> Yeah, you're right. You're fucked.<eos> [sighs]<eos> But that's not your problem.<eos> Your problem is that you didn't tell me that covering for you with Mr. Success was putting my family in the crosshairs of some ex-cop gangster and some still-cop psycho looking to pay you back for taking his eye.
Now, you know, no matter how pissed off I am at you, and I fucking am, that I would never wanna see you get hurt...<eos> Katie, no.<eos> If they show up, you tell them everything you know about how to find me, you understand?<eos> Vince is a dangerous man, but he's not crazy.<eos> As long as you don't get in his way, he's got no reason to hurt you or your family.
This time of day, hour and a quarter, little less if I push it.<eos> Listen, I got a score lined up.<eos> It turns into a pumpkin at 4:30 or 5:00.<eos> The hardware's an Excelsior 500 series.<eos> There's ten grand in it for you.
Now, I completely understand... the delay is not... that it's due to circumstances beyond your... beyond anyone's control, but there's just so long I can stay on this... this hamster wheel robbing Peter to Pay Paul.<eos> - So there's any way to... - [beep]<eos> Female voice:<eos> Sorry. The mailbox is now full.<eos> My grandson says this will be child's play for you.
Good news.<eos> He's gone.<eos> It's like the second home run.<eos> - I'm filthy dirty.<eos> - That's what I love about you.
Quite as usual?<eos> Kinda what you'd be expecting when you work in a bookstore.<eos> - And how's your job, Paul?<eos> - Fine. Took a couple of days off until we're all settled in.<eos> I'm sure they will survive without you.
Great you could come all the way down here to see us.<eos> Must you be leaving so soon?<eos> Come on, guys, really?<eos> Please...<eos> Look, I've got the guest room almost ready for you.
- Hm. Then, perhaps you can use this.<eos> - What is this?<eos> - It's a necklace.<eos> It's used to ward off evil.<eos> For protection. Will it protect me against you?
Yes, I will go change.<eos> Uh, okay, he's acting fucking weird.<eos> He's trying to be on best behavior.<eos> I suggest you do the same.<eos> We're changing our plans for you.
I do, but unfortunately, I just started my ten minute break.<eos> His name is Patrick.<eos> Someone else here would be happy to help you.<eos> Oh, I don't want someone else.<eos> I just want you.
I'm sure I'll have very pleasant dreams tonight after that story.<eos> It'll be a nice tale to tell our children.<eos> Right.<eos> "Hey kids, the gateway to hell is in our basement, so go get some sleep."<eos> All right, I got some extra towels for you here, temperature should be okay, but, if you need some blankets or something, they're in the closet. All right?
- Okay, just drop it.<eos> All right?<eos> - You can't tell me you didn't notice.<eos> Please.<eos> Those weird remarks at the bartender, staring at the waitress' ass all evening, while flirting with her right in front of you.
Can I help you with something, Paul?<eos> Actually you can.<eos> And I think I might be able to help you, as well.<eos> You see, her loss is your gain.<eos> Now I see what Jenny sees in you.
The door's that way, elephant man.<eos> Maybe I won't mention this incredible lack of judgment to Jenny.<eos> You know, for someone who's so into demons and devils, I'm surprised you never considered how it would feel.<eos> How would what feel?<eos> For him to get into you.
- Weird.<eos> You know what, I'm gonna call Monica, the realtor.<eos> Let's see if she's got a key.<eos> Hey...<eos> I have a surprise for you.
What re you hiding down here?<eos> Is it like a torture dungeon?<eos> - Close. Very close.<eos> - Did you guys get a sex wing?<eos> After you.
Skivvying?<eos> Cleaning, offices.<eos> - No shame in it.<eos> - Never said there is.<eos> It's all right for you.
I'm here in an official capacity.<eos> Not seen much of you since the Wessex raid.<eos> When are you gonna give me the inside story?<eos> I'm sure you've spoken to everybody else.<eos> All bar you and Inspector Thursday's daughter.
Unlikely to move in the same social circle.<eos> Maybe they're just random - strangers' names picked out of a phone book.<eos> Well, if that's the case, his next victim could be anyone in Oxford.<eos> Morse, any thoughts?<eos> Not like you to be backward in coming forwards.
- I loved my sister.<eos> Well, she didn't love you.<eos> Not in the way you wanted her to.<eos> She was afraid of you.<eos> You're why she killed herself.
You've been on another planet for days now.<eos> It's Devon.<eos> What'd she do?<eos> I'm not sure even I want to know all the details, but it's not good.<eos> Could it blow back on you?
You remember your home inspection being so scary?<eos> I don't.<eos> Everything on that report makes it sound like my bungalow's gonna burst into flames as soon as I close escrow.<eos> "So great you're gonna be a homeowner, Devon.<eos> I'm really happy for you, Devon."
I don't.<eos> Everything on that report makes it sound like my bungalow's gonna burst into flames as soon as I close escrow.<eos> "So great you're gonna be a homeowner, Devon.<eos> I'm really happy for you, Devon."<eos> I am happy for you.
Did you do this?<eos> No, but...<eos> Yo, his skin be going all gray like he's cloudy and overcast.<eos> Please.<eos> For you.
Is there anybody else here with you?<eos> No.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> I chased them away with my sadness.<eos> And I'll chase you away, too.
Even when we really don't want to be.<eos> I've already tried to kill myself once.<eos> And you are still here, right?<eos> Not so easy to shake this mortal coil.<eos> Until someone sits on you till you die.
Hey!<eos> Rory, Stop, stop!<eos> Rory?<eos> You have no fuel.<eos> It's behind you!
I do not want back down there living with those motherfuckers.<eos> I just want you to say you trust me.<eos> Yeah?<eos> I do.<eos> I trust you.
"She has said and declared that if it is successful, she'll attempt a play."<eos> Well, good for her.<eos> What?<eos> Uch. For God's sake, she's an actress.<eos> At 75 years old, maybe she doesn't care as much as you do.
You're always drunk.<eos> Well, I saw you with Townsend.<eos> We were just talking.<eos> You were in each other's arms.<eos> He's been after you ever since he met you.
There's a lot of drinking involved.<eos> But not now. We're off it now.<eos> Oh, come on, Zelda, for real.<eos> It feels like I haven't been back here in ages.<eos> Tell me about you. And Montgomery. And Livye.
I have to run a school, and you have to go enroll in one.<eos> You know the saying,<eos> "If you see something, say something."<eos> Please stop.<eos> Honey, I care about you and your friends.
You know the saying,<eos> "If you see something, say something."<eos> Please stop.<eos> Honey, I care about you and your friends.<eos> But mostly, I care about you.
Well, on that note, I crown you Queen Alice the Wise.<eos> No, wait.<eos> Since we're cleaning slates and shit, give me.<eos> Q.<eos> Uh, I could start by saying something cruel yet totally hilarious about you.
But that's... well, that's because you're honest about what you love.<eos> And underneath it all, that's... inspiring.<eos> And I'm sorry too.<eos> Not about the sex, I don't even really remember it.<eos> Mostly my part in fucking up something that was good for you.
I mean, once or twice?<eos> - Listen, I don't mean to be disrespectful, okay.<eos> But I have never, or never will cheat on my wife.<eos> -Okay, okay.<eos> - You know, I might have a couple of little surprises for you.
- Hmm-mm.<eos> -Hello.<eos> -Hey, Luke, it's Jeff.<eos> -Hey, what's up?<eos> - I'm gonna need a favor from you.
-Thanks.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Eddie.<eos> -Yeah?<eos> I think i got something for you.
-Yes, you will.<eos> - Eddie green...<eos> - Mr. driffites.<eos> -Hey, nice to see you.<eos> - Good to see you, my friend.
No way.<eos> I didn't tell him to kill that kid.<eos> I'm not paying for that shit.<eos> -It's not about that.<eos> If you don't pay, he's going to come after you.
- Like I said, i ain't going nowhere.<eos> And if I get arrested, you're gonna be my lawyer.<eos> And if I get convicted, you better believe I'm gonna cut a deal.<eos> Hey, cabron, it's not my fault you got spooked and had me rush out of that house last minute, okay?<eos> You see, the blame falls on you.
I wanted to evacuate the wounded.<eos> Besides, it's better this way.<eos> We only have one MEDEVAC left.<eos> Without medical rescue, there's no reason for us to be here.<eos> No reason for you, apparently.
Have you got a boyfriend...<eos> No.<eos> You just blew it.<eos> You're too green, Sanchez.<eos> He'll be all over you now.
I took out a motorcycle but the other one got away.<eos> I'm okay.<eos> They shot me in the ass!<eos> Damn it.<eos> A little closer and you'd have to bang Pe√±a's girlfriend yourself!
Yes..<eos> Good.<eos> You should learn how I do it.<eos> - Sure.<eos> I have done it so many times for you.
I hope you don't mind him.<eos> - It's all right.<eos> So..<eos> Mrs. Mukherjee..<eos> Whenever she talks about you all she does is sing praises of you.
In the dark, if you have a partner the void can be filled.<eos> You have confused me, completely!<eos> Do you want to get married or not?<eos> I want to, but not right now.<eos> I want to give you some time. Just to be sure, you know to think about yourself, about me and us.
- Thanks.<eos> - Stop it.<eos> Listen..<eos> What?<eos> - I have a special gift for you.
Rohan, if you don't want to eat let us go to bed.<eos> I just want to sit alone for some time.<eos> You may go to bed.<eos> Rohan..<eos> I can understand that I am not the same for you, as I was.
I will consider that..<eos> whatever we had before yesterday was simply a dream.<eos> Dinner is on the table, Rohan.<eos> Have a little before going to bed.<eos> 'Your wife is so good that she can starve for you..'
Since you had dubbed these voices, I had no other choice.<eos> Ready.<eos> - Great!<eos> Let's go again.<eos> 'Your wife is so good that she can starve for you' 'but she can never keep her mouth shut.'
I need to meet Mr. Chaube.<eos> Sir is out.<eos> He must have a cell phone.<eos> Give me his number.<eos> Do you think he's free for you?
What nonsense!<eos> - Don't worry, Inspector Nalavde.<eos> I will not make the mistake of filing a complaint again.<eos> Besides..<eos> I have no hopes from you, neither does Su.
"Spend some time with me, it won't be a crime."<eos> "Sometimes, I find you bitter.<eos> Are you a girl or wine?"<eos> "The people want to know when you will fall for someone."<eos> "Everyone is spellbound by you, and I am one of them."
Good morning, Mrs. Bhatnagar.<eos> Good morning..<eos> - Good morning, Mr. Bhatnagar.<eos> "Since a few days"<eos> "I've gotten used to you."
- Good morning, Mr. Bhatnagar.<eos> "Since a few days"<eos> "I've gotten used to you."<eos> "Since a few days"<eos> "I've gotten used to you."
"I've gotten used to you."<eos> "Since a few days"<eos> "you've become my habit."<eos> "Your smile makes me smile."<eos> "I want to get lost in you."
"you've become my habit."<eos> "Your smile makes me smile."<eos> "I want to get lost in you."<eos> "I don't think"<eos> "I can live without you now."
"Your smile makes me smile."<eos> "I want to get lost in you."<eos> "I don't think"<eos> "I can live without you now."<eos> "My love for you"
"these days.."<eos> "Nothing that's mine belongs to me anymore."<eos> "It's all yours."<eos> "Since a few days"<eos> "I've gotten used to you."
Understand?<eos> And both of us had fun with that woman!<eos> Twice!<eos> You're talking about that blind woman today.<eos> Who was she to you?
Jesus!<eos> What am I, five?<eos> Hey.<eos> Last piece?<eos> Saved it just for you.
When you least expect it...<eos> Out of the blue...<eos> There he is.<eos> Hey.<eos> None of this is just you.
You don't get shit.<eos> That's why they called me.<eos> No, I just... Ah, my dick!<eos> Yo, I almost frigging burned my dick off.<eos> No, I don't get why he called ...you.
Fritz Haaber?<eos> Who wants to know?<eos> It is you.<eos> I don't know if you remember me, Lou Ellen Drought?<eos> I was a few years behind you in High School.
Happy birthday.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Happy birthday.<eos> - Thanks. - I have some gifts for you.
Well, this is just like Adam's pitch and that didn't work out so great,<eos> - so. - No, no, no. But see, it's not, because I can admit that I don't have, like, a lot of other things going on.<eos> Currently living in my mom's home gym... - Mm-hmm. - and my band broke up.<eos> But the thing is, I still have a lot to give, a lot.<eos> So, why not give it to you and this little angel?
Well, it's not helpful. Remember last time?<eos> All she did was complain about how unfair the judging process on "The Voice" is.<eos> She's not helpful.<eos> She makes things harder for me.<eos> Okay, well, then, I didn't call her here for you.
And then I would know what, like, a normal, functional family looked like, and I wouldn't be up here with Marnie acting like that was normal.<eos> You know?<eos> And this house would be a home and not just a fucking bunch of rooms.<eos> So, thank you.<eos> No, thank you, Hannah.
Why?<eos> It's just not my time.<eos> This is important.<eos> Hannah's my best friend.<eos> Has it ever occurred to you that the best thing for you and your friendship would be if you were happy, too?
What do you think your mom's gonna do when you get home?<eos> I don't know. Hug me, I guess?<eos> Exactly!<eos> 'Cause she loves you more than anything else in the world, and she knows you're the most important thing even if it means being emotionally abused by a brat day in and day out, okay?<eos> She'll take care of you forever even if it means endless, endless pain!
Hey, you're a part of her lie whether you go or not.<eos> Yeah, but how am I gonna look into the eye of my friend Ray and say, "Oh, upstate was great,"<eos> when really I was just in this apartment, eating Flamin' Hot Cheetos, working on my article about Staten Island's last remaining sex cult.<eos> Ugh, which I am so excited about.<eos> I'm so proud of you really cracking that case.
Okay, with my women.<eos> With my women.<eos> I stand corrected.<eos> Hannah, if you were gonna be such a bitch, why did you even come?<eos> Oh, I don't know, 'cause I was trying to protect you and your house of lies, you fucking morons.
I'm living my truth. Right?<eos> (Desi, outside) Don't be like that!<eos> How much is that tea set in the window?<eos> It's so beautiful.<eos> Mm. For you?
- Rachel: It was just so rude.<eos> - like, awful.<eos> - Rachel: It hurt so much.<eos> - Zeva:<eos> I... However, we just can't trust you to re-enter our lives right now
You've put up with a lot of bullshit, too.<eos> - Yeah, I know.<eos> - And I'm gonna help you get out of this situation.<eos> We're gonna get out of this bed you made.<eos> All I need is for you to actually look at yourself.
Good catch.<eos> Well, you put it right in my face, so...<eos> Yeah, yeah, I did.<eos> But I am a writer, and as such, I think I'm obligated to use my voice to talk about things that are meaningful to me. And...<eos> I read something about you that troubled me, that troubled me greatly.
Mayaan, I'm not gonna tell you when you can see our daughter.<eos> I'm gonna tell you when I want to see our daughter, and then we'll take it from there.<eos> And, being the mother, no doubt you'll win.<eos> Rest assured you'll win.<eos> No, no, it's not a swipe at you... it's not.
Which, by the way, is lovely.<eos> I had no idea novelists could make this much money.<eos> No, I didn't call them.<eos> I didn't call any of them.<eos> I only called you.
- Yeah, I do wanna know.<eos> - To fix that.<eos> I mean, it's spoiled with Denise.<eos> I...<eos> I know it is, but I can ask you where you're from, what you want, who you are.
Good goal.<eos> That's a really good goal.<eos> - So, maybe one day, you'll be famous.<eos> - Pfft, maybe.<eos> And a lot of people know some stuff about you.
Why don't you keep the Roth?<eos> - Seriously?<eos> - Yeah, seriously.<eos> I like how happy it makes you.<eos> But it's signed to you and everything.
I just wanna feel close to someone in a way that I haven't in a long time.<eos> If you please.<eos> Your bed smells like snacks.<eos> I live alone, lady.<eos> I'm sorry I wrote something about you that, um, upset you so much without considering all the facts.
You're gross.<eos> Hannah, can you text that one interesting lesbian you know and see if she can get me into the "New York Mag" party tonight?<eos> I don't know, Elijah.<eos> My bladder's on fire.<eos> I don't know if I feel like abusing my media contacts for you right now.
Are you... are you serious?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Did you hear what she said, man?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Because you just made my whole drug treatment about you.
What's that supposed to mean?<eos> How long were you on the community board?<eos> Three months?<eos> Then you quietly retreated back to dating girls with six packs and pretending death wasn't real.<eos> I'm worried about you, Ray.
- It's free money!<eos> - You know what, Herm?<eos> You're starting to really fucking piss me off.<eos> You know that?<eos> I work hard for you.
I'm slipping.<eos> Oh, fuck.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> I'm not sure if you remember me.<eos> Uh, I remember you.
- Hey.<eos> - Hey. What about the party?<eos> Ugh, it was total bullshit.<eos> It was just, like, a bunch of old gays being like, "Oh, I'm so busy during the week. I can only do uppers on the weekends."<eos> Oh, well, good for you, Anthony.
If you're joining us now, we are less than a minute away from entering a new future.<eos> This is really big for me.<eos> I want it to be good for you guys too, you know.<eos> I know.<eos> And I'm proud of you.
Well... a little up and down, to tell you the truth.<eos> You know, new city and everything.<eos> They have a lot of questions.<eos> And frankly I still don't fully understand what I'm doing here myself.<eos> Before we go any further this is for you.
You've been so good to us, and you don't owe us anything... - Mia...<eos> - ...and I think maybe it's time that...<eos> No.<eos> Come on.<eos> I don't want Donny and I to stand in the way of something that's so important to you.
Maybe even change the world.<eos> And I thought maybe I could help you... and your mom, too.<eos> That's a big responsibility.<eos> Maybe the biggest responsibility of my life.<eos> I don't want Donny and I to stand in the way of something that's so important to you.
But if you need to go, that's fine, you know.<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> Don't put words in my mouth.<eos> I want to be here for... with...<eos> for you and with you, just maybe not in this exact house.
30 years later, here I am alone on the edge of a cliff.<eos> And this poor baby won't even have a grandmother.<eos> - What's that supposed to mean?<eos> - Think about it, Hannah.<eos> Your grandparents took you and your cousins to Colonial Williamsburg.
I need you to watch it so I can move on and do my film festival submissions. Submit!<eos> Submit away, Adam.<eos> Go to Cannes, I don't care.<eos> But I think when you watch it, you'll be liberated from what I can say were, for me, some very painful memories.<eos> Great, our relationship amounted to very painful memories for you.
What the fuck am I supposed to do?<eos> I feel like I just chugged a bunch of Robitussin or something.<eos> Listen, calm down, okay?<eos> He's, like, nothing.<eos> He doesn't have any power over you.
Hi, there.<eos> Okay.<eos> Woman: Elijah Krantz?<eos> Yeah, I'm here.<eos> We're ready for you.
Just a super quick...<eos> Thank you.<eos> Clearly you're here for the auditions.<eos> Fuck, yeah.<eos> Oh. Good for you, honey.
Fuck that.<eos> Men are only on this earth to buy us jeans.<eos> I got to get out of here. I can't go in that room and sing "Santa Fe" from "Newsies" right now.<eos> Then don't sing "Santa Fe" from "Newsies."<eos> Sing some shit that's real to you right now.
I got out everything I needed to say.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Well, be good, Hannah.<eos> Dill: Sounds like he didn't have much to say.<eos> Sounds like he dismissed you... the way I dismissed Elijah.
I gotta ask, why did you wait until you were pregnant to start wearing halfway decent underwear?<eos> I don't feel so good.<eos> Well, honey, of course you don't feel good.<eos> It's 127 degrees in here and we are poor.<eos> You've got a parasite growing inside of you.
That's a whole lot of pops.<eos> Yeah, I mean, they're for, like, the next three days.<eos> I won't have to keep going back and forth and getting pops.<eos> What are you doing on my block?<eos> Well, I'm looking for you, actually.
I wanna raise your child with you.<eos> I miss you, and I miss being with you.<eos> And I thought I could move on, but hearing about the baby made me realize we don't have any more time to waste.<eos> Let me... let me show you who I've become.<eos> I wanna be there for you as you become a mother, I wanna watch you blossom and love this baby more than anyone has ever loved a living thing.
I miss you, and I miss being with you.<eos> And I thought I could move on, but hearing about the baby made me realize we don't have any more time to waste.<eos> Let me... let me show you who I've become.<eos> I wanna be there for you as you become a mother, I wanna watch you blossom and love this baby more than anyone has ever loved a living thing.<eos> I don't wanna be away from you any longer.
- Yes, you can look.<eos> All right, great.<eos> Um... really sorry to barge in.<eos> Ah, I don't know what's up here, ah, and if I interrupted something, I'm sorry, but this is important.<eos> Ah, I really, really felt like it was important that I come up here and make it known to both of you, but mostly you, that I am here and totally up for raising this baby.
I got to go.<eos> - Look.<eos> I stole these.<eos> - Oh, my God!<eos> I'm so proud of you.
Isn't it?<eos> I mean, you know, who knew all you needed was the right cocktail of pills and then you could really stabilize.<eos> I mean, for now.<eos> Who knows for sure?<eos> And you, my beauty, how are you experiencing life?
Um, since you're here, this is Byron.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Pleasure, Byron.<eos> So, um, basically, you're gonna act as if you invited me?<eos> Uh, yeah, I think I'm gonna pretend like I invited you to my engagement party, and you wore overalls, which is a pretty typical move.
I went to school with her granddaughter Delia.<eos> Does everyone in town know you?<eos> Pretty much.<eos> Okay.<eos> So tell me something that I should know about you, Zelda Sayre.
How could any of it be in vain when it's all so miraculous?<eos> Oh, in the end, I guess we're just humans, drunk on the idea that love can fix everything.<eos> Because it can.<eos> You are the finest, loveliest, most glorious person I've ever met.<eos> I have something for you.
You're everything.<eos> I care if you're a writer.<eos> You can't give up your dreams.<eos> It's who you are.<eos> The only thing that I know, darling girl, is without you nothing's possible.
- Zelda, I need you.<eos> Marry me.<eos> You don't need me. You don't need anybody.<eos> You're as good a writer as there is, Scott Fitzgerald.<eos> No, without you I'm nothing.
Previously on Bates Motel...<eos> It's like there's a cord between our hearts.<eos> It's you and me.<eos> It's always been you and me.<eos> We belong to each other, and I don't ever want to live in a world without you.
We're charging you additionally with the murders of Jim Blackwell and Audrey Ellis.<eos> Norman is nice... okay, he's kind, he's a good person... but he just... he has another side to him.<eos> You know, I don't...<eos> I don't know what you'd call it, maybe multiple personalities or something, but he... he changes.<eos> I'm coming for you when you least expect it.
He hasn't even been convicted.<eos> Right here.<eos> I think we should...<eos> Norman?<eos> It's not for you to be here.
Thanks.<eos> Just... tell me that's for protecting your wife and your daughter.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And me.<eos> And you?
I know.<eos> I know that she can be so stubborn sometimes.<eos> I... it's just because she gets hurt so easily, and I-I know that the two of you had that terrible fight before we moved from Scottsdale, but I just... I think this could be a new beginning,<eos> Dylan, for all of us.<eos> And we're not a family without you, Dylan, and... so I just really think we should start over and... and be together and... and that I guess the real reason that I'm calling is,
He's not dangerous to me.<eos> You sound like Norma.<eos> Tell me you love me, Emma.<eos> I'm not gonna arm you up so you can go and do something stupid.<eos> I'll never love anyone else but you.
You must be sick.<eos> Poor thing.<eos> Here, let me help you.<eos> Poor Dylan.<eos> This has all been too much for you.
You have to deal with it.<eos> You... you need to come, and you need to turn yourself in, and we need to get you help.<eos> That's what you want for me?<eos> To be shut up in some prison for the criminally insane and drugged out of my mind?<eos> I don't know what I want for you!
Previously on "Bates Motel"...<eos> I am dead. And why am I pretending to be dead?<eos> So I could get away from everyone, everything that could distract me from you.
It was your way of trying to get rid of me.<eos> And I'm still alive.<eos> For now.<eos> Great seeing you, Sheriff.<eos> I'm coming for you when you least expect it, so don't get too cozy up at that house all by yourself.
It's just... that's actually not why I... why I came.<eos> I wanted to show you something.<eos> Go on.<eos> Take a look.<eos> I have a business proposition for you.
- Bye.<eos> - Bye.<eos> She looks like me.<eos> Why are you having dinner with someone who looks like me?<eos> I don't think she looks like you.
These are Bindu and Abhi's top ten favourite songs.<eos> Not favourite songs.<eos> But songs that are part of our lives.<eos> So this is the soundtrack to the lives of Abhi and Bindu.<eos> Don't go away, don't leave me now... my heart hasn't had its fill of you.
Our mixed tape.<eos> Our 4x2.5" dirty secret.<eos> A tape filled with Lata, Kishore, Asha, Rafi, RD, Bappi-da.<eos> And Bindu,<eos> Don't go away, don't leave me now... my heart hasn't had its fill of you.
Don't sulk.<eos> Bubble Wrap.<eos> Come.<eos> - why are you so heavy?<eos> - Know what I like about you?
Let it go to hell... the material world.<eos> Let me drop by your home some day.<eos> Leave your window open... and let me fly away.<eos> Let me play... let joy overcome me.<eos> O lovely girl, let me get close to you.
When? Where?<eos> Congratulations my love!<eos> Would have loved to come.<eos> But it's placement week.<eos> Devdas must be singing a sad song for you.
And a full tank.<eos> Mind your own business.<eos> I'll fill your tank.<eos> Where are you nowadays?<eos> Near you.
Our songs.<eos> - Like our dirty secret?<eos> - Exactly.<eos> - Just tape them back to back.<eos> - Ten for me. ten for you.
Then one day I decided to move on.<eos> Quit my job... and landed up in the world of Hindi pulp publishers.<eos> Mr Roy, you're trying too hard.<eos> Don't copy Gulzar.<eos> It's beyond you.
Nothing.<eos> I know you won't come... but I figured I should do one thing right.<eos> I know I'm being selfish.<eos> But how could I marry without telling you?<eos> I'm happy for you.
I'm happy for you.<eos> Ok.<eos> I'm hanging up.<eos> I know that you are now a stranger to me... but Still... sometimes this thought crosses my mind...<eos> Carrom is beyond you.
Give us time.<eos> I tend to grow on people.<eos> I forgot. What was our emergency code?<eos> Two, or three rings?<eos> Everything was an emergency to you.
Yeah.<eos> Listen.<eos> Tell me if you still want to run away with me.<eos> I'll carry you on my shudders... and Whoosh!<eos> I'll be too heavy for you now.
You a doctor?<eos> I am.<eos> And do you like it?<eos> Has its moments.<eos> Do you like what you do?
I never thought your little device would actually work.<eos> How did you find me?<eos> The details aren't important.<eos> Yeah, I suppose not.<eos> I wasn't sure the machine would return to you.
The details aren't important.<eos> Yeah, I suppose not.<eos> I wasn't sure the machine would return to you.<eos> Then I realized I didn't have the key.<eos> To you, the Columbus of a new age.
I envisioned a society that was entirely different.<eos> Yeah, II think we all did.<eos> It's not without its beauty, though.<eos> I must take issue with something that you said earlier.<eos> There is absolutely nothing mediocre about you.
Enough, John.<eos> I have the key. Where is Jane?<eos> Do you really want to take me back to 1893?<eos> You must pay for your crimes.<eos> Well, a quick history lesson for you, H.G...
Great.<eos> Let's wrap it up and get out of here.<eos> Can it be fixed?<eos> Never mind this.<eos> I'm more concerned with you.
I'd like to feel what you feel... think what you think.<eos> I want to suck every part of your body.<eos> Nothing about you disgusts me.<eos> - Recently... - There are moments...<eos> - ... I dreamed I was inside you.
I'm the father-in-law.<eos> - I mean, the father.<eos> - Don't listen to him.<eos> - I'll take those.<eos> - No, they're not for you.
- Yes, her mother.<eos> - Hello.<eos> A pleasure.<eos> - I'm Carlos.<eos> - Here, for you, for the new house.
Then you can pay for it.<eos> Tomorrow you start looking for a weekend job.<eos> Is that what you care about?<eos> Have you nothing to tell me?<eos> To tell you?
- What does that say?<eos> - You're filthy!<eos> We haven't had enough to drink. I usually put the whole thing.<eos> - Can we go now? - Yes, let's go.<eos> - And when will I see you?
- Who was the DJ?<eos> - Someone from Amsterdam.<eos> What was the music?<eos> Techno.<eos> - Do you like techno?
- Scram.<eos> Moro. - Moro.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> What is it?<eos> We had a jealous boyfriend here looking for you.
I am you.<eos> - You are me.<eos> - You are me. - I could feel inside you.<eos> - There are moments, - when I want to stop being me...<eos> - I dreamed I was inside you.
- There are moments, - when I want to stop being me...<eos> - I dreamed I was inside you.<eos> - ...so I can be you.<eos> - Recently...<eos> Nothing about you disgusts me.
I'd like to feel what you feel...<eos> - I'd like to... - Think what you think.<eos> I'd like to feel what you feel, think what you think.<eos> I want to suck every part of your body.<eos> Nothing about you disgusts me.
- Who is she?<eos> Mother, she's married.<eos> You can't have other people in your life, especially women.<eos> I went to see Romero in prison.<eos> I'm coming for you when you least expect it.
You've been a really good friend.<eos> But why?<eos> I enjoy helping people.<eos> Can you keep this secret about me?<eos> Can I trust you, Chick?
I shouldn't have followed you to that restaurant.<eos> It was stupid.<eos> You were right.<eos> I just feel like I go a bit crazy here on my own all the time.<eos> Yeah, I'm sure it's hard on you too.
I just... I felt better today.<eos> I... I felt happy.<eos> I went for a walk in the woods, and I felt better than I'd felt in so long, ever since...<eos> Since you have to do this.<eos> I'm sorry, but I have done it for you more than once.
Senator Wilkes didn't die of a heart attack.<eos> He was poisoned.<eos> And those same people, they are coming after me.<eos> What people?<eos> Five more seconds and I'm leaving with or without you.
She's getting in the car.<eos> Wilkes was assassinated because of some intelligence that I shared with him.<eos> Wait, you went round Langley and straight to the Senate Intelligence Committee?<eos> I didn't know who to trust.<eos> Tell me I can trust you, Christina.
- Tough guy. - Okay, look.<eos> I am obviously sorry for the...<eos> Holy shit.<eos> That's Michael Landon.<eos> I know that's not significant for you, but for me, that's so fucking crazy that I'm seeing Michael Landon right now.
Sad face.<eos> So, let's watch them die, America!<eos> Three days to the finish line, three days of carnage from Old New York to New Los Angeles.<eos> From sea to shining sea.<eos> More space for you and me!
Back, I'm talking, way, way back, when Jim was just a skinny kid and Laura wasn't such a bitch.<eos> Does anybody remember salespeople?<eos> How about waitresses?<eos> You know, little blondes in aprons about this big.<eos> Jim, how many people have you got working for you?
We've been smelling cow dung for three states.<eos> Ain't nothing here for me in this fucking Red Zone.<eos> Death to infidels!<eos> Shit!<eos> No virgins for you, motherfucker! Fuck me! Shit!
Of course, because all you care about is the fucking race!<eos> Millions of people stuck in their miserable lives, but none of that matters as long as you win!<eos> God, the people love you!<eos> God damn it, the people love you!<eos> You have a responsibility, they would listen to you.
- Hi.<eos> - Asha.<eos> - Right.<eos> Sorry, um...<eos> I-I just wanted to tell you that Cali never stopped talking about you.
- Tell him what I just told you.<eos> Tell him to keep it to himself and make something up.<eos> I need a couple of days, at least.<eos> Where you going?<eos> This is for you and Mom.
- DEA agent Mike Hall.<eos> - You there?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> They're coming at me.<eos> It's only a matter of time before they come for you, too,
They're coming at me.<eos> It's only a matter of time before they come for you, too,<eos> - if they're not already.<eos> - Whoa... who's...<eos> - Who's coming at you?
I'll be okay.<eos> Went straight through.<eos> - Where are you?<eos> - Some hotel in Jersey.<eos> I'm coming to get you.
No.<eos> I'm the one Zack wanted to see; I should be present.<eos> No.<eos> Aubrey's right.<eos> Zack wants you, which is the last thing that we should give him.
Miss Delfs was just one of many who came to see me.<eos> It is odd, but being perceived as a murderous cannibal does have some advantages.<eos> Okay, Dr. Lecter, why don't you take a seat?<eos> Thanks.<eos> Dr. Hodgins here has got some questions for you.
How do you know when it's different, Mama?<eos> I don't know.<eos> What kind of answer is that?<eos> What kind of answer did you want?<eos> Well, he cares about you a great deal. Anyone can see that and...
Nothing.<eos> Uh, she has to leave.<eos> - You're sorry?<eos> - Yeah, I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry to you.
Hat? Yeah.<eos> So?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, really nice!<eos> Shall I come towards you?
Oh. Martha!<eos> Oh, my God, I am so sorry.<eos> I couldn't find you at the airport and I was going to call, but that's when I realised I'd left my phone in the Jeep, and I went to get it, I couldn't remember where I'd parked...<eos> Suffice to say, it's all been a bit of a disaster, my...<eos> Hello. back to you.
So lovely to see you both. And you.<eos> Goodnight, Martha.<eos> Night.<eos> So I was thinking maybe I could cook you for dinner tomorrow?<eos> Sorry, I mean, cook dinner FOR you tomorrow?
Maverick, however, has been all but forgotten.<eos> Let's see what he's been up to in this episode of Are They Still Cool?<eos> Surf Edition.<eos> So, Cody, why don't you fill us in on what you've done the last few years?<eos> First, I have a question for you.
Boards, wetsuits, wax.<eos> It's kind of a sweet deal.<eos> Yeah, it sounds pretty rad.<eos> Oh, it is, bro.<eos> And I owe it all to you.
If you hadn't saved my life and let me win the Big Z Memorial I'd never be where I am today.<eos> Heck, you'd probably be the one with all the sponsors and endorsements.<eos> Surfing on the tour, being on TV, screaming fans...<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah. I get it. I get it.<eos> I'm happy for you, Joe.
Surfing on the tour, being on TV, screaming fans...<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah. I get it. I get it.<eos> I'm happy for you, Joe.<eos> You deserve it.<eos> Hey, Cody. I picked this up for you while I was on tour.
- Penguin Lani!<eos> - It's so good to see you.<eos> Chicken Joe, can you teach us your moves?<eos> You're the "awesome-est"!<eos> Yeah, we wanna learn from you.
How totally awesome is this, bro?<eos> I'm gonna join the Hang 5.<eos> Can you even imagine what that would be like?<eos> Yeah, that sounds pretty rad.<eos> But, um, are you sure Mr. McMahon was talking about you, bro?
And then she said that I should get your autograph because she wants to sell it online.<eos> What?<eos> That's awesome, Lani.<eos> Cody, your imaginary friends are gonna be so disappointed.<eos> So I guess they asked you.
Hang 5!<eos> Prepare for boarding.<eos> Don't be nervous.<eos> You're gonna do great.<eos> - I have a good feeling about you. - Ha-ha.
That was quite a spill you took out there.<eos> How does my dust taste?<eos> You cut me off, you cheater.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> - I'd never do anything to hurt you.
I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> - I'd never do anything to hurt you.<eos> - Hey! You should learn to stay out of my way.<eos> I'm gonna join the Hang 5, no matter what.<eos> How badly you want to lose is entirely up to you.
Yep. So we're all fine down here.<eos> Well, you all sleep tight then.<eos> Don't let the bed bugs bite.<eos> Oh, we won't.<eos> And the bed bugs will bite you.
And the bed bugs will bite you.<eos> Don't hate me, man.<eos> I'm just polishing my trophy.<eos> I think I just laid an egg.<eos> I didn't forget about you, babe.
Yeah, I think I need a minute to calm down from all the excitement.<eos> My heart's jumping out of my chest.<eos> Yeah, I can imagine.<eos> This has been some day.<eos> Must be a pretty big deal to you.
Tank, don't!<eos> Stay in formation.<eos> It's the only way.<eos> Don't let it touch you.<eos> Unh! Undertaker, I'm coming for you.
surf Edition, take mo.<eos> Can you tell us what you've been up to...<eos> - ...for the last couple years?<eos> - Oh, it's been a crazy ride, man.<eos> But first, I have a question for you.
- Okay, cut.<eos> - Wait, stop. Stop.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We'll be there in four, three, mo... Oh!<eos> I picked this up for you while I was on tour.
It's totally normal before your first trip.<eos> Are you thinking, like, "What if it's a bad trip and it breaks my brain and I'm never the same?"<eos> I wasn't thinking that... no, but I'll gladly throw that onto the pile.<eos> Uh, no, I guess...<eos> Honestly, I just... I feel a little weird doing drugs in front of you when you're sober.
I don't wanna forget that I said that, so can you write that down, please?<eos> My brain's not friends with my hands right now.<eos> You wanna go outside?<eos> That usually feels good when you're tripping.<eos> I trust you entirely at this point.
Don't run away.<eos> Help me.<eos> Pull me in.<eos> Yeah, I got this.<eos> - Bertie, I'm behind you.
FBI.<eos> Here to ask you a few questions about last Friday night.<eos> We have evidence that you were in the woods at Greenwood Barrens. So?<eos> Far as I know, there's no law against communing with nature.<eos> Well, unfortunately for you, there is a law against drugs.
And I wasn't talking about your eyebrow or your legs.<eos> Thank you, Daisy.<eos> I think it just, you know, took me a while to realize that my legs are merely a way for me to carry around what's in here.<eos> And, you know, what's in here.<eos> I'm happy for you.
My proprietary algorithm allows me to recognize millions of objects, gestures, and voice commands.<eos> See, Booth?<eos> AMI is no different than us.<eos> That is not accurate, Dr. Brennan.<eos> Unlike you, my memory will never degrade with age.
I have no evidence of the sort.<eos> I know you don't.<eos> But, you know, I have faith you're gonna find it.<eos> Booth, I can't embark on my research with the presumption of Zack's innocence.<eos> I have faith in you.
Oh, Bones, time to blow out the candles.<eos> Grandpa, you dropped this.<eos> Oh... oh, thank you.<eos> Okay, we're lit up and ready to roll.<eos> ‚ô™ Happy birthday to you ‚ô™
Grandpa, you dropped this.<eos> Oh... oh, thank you.<eos> Okay, we're lit up and ready to roll.<eos> ‚ô™ Happy birthday to you ‚ô™<eos> ‚ô™ Happy birthday to you ‚ô™
‚ô™ Happy birthday... ‚ô™<eos> ‚ô™ Doctor... ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Dear... ‚ô™<eos> ‚ô™ Brennan ‚ô™<eos> ‚ô™ Happy birthday ‚ô™<eos> ‚ô™ To you. ‚ô™
- No, I didn't.<eos> It's gonna be okay, Mr. Hudmore.<eos> I'm here.<eos> It's gonna be okay.<eos> We're gonna take care of you.
Okay, you do that.<eos> You call your lawyer, and he'll get you out in no time.<eos> But that's when I get started.<eos> What is that supposed to mean?<eos> I'll be all over you.
Yes, it is.<eos> Do you know how much that thing cost me?<eos> A lot.<eos> They're very expensive.<eos> But it's good for you, because then it'll confirm your story.
Okay, I needed him.<eos> I needed someone and he wouldn't even talk to me.<eos> I understand, all right?<eos> You felt abandoned.<eos> No one was there for you.
I can barely get her away from HSM whenever it's on.<eos> Oh! No, no, no.<eos> Hey. Where are you going?<eos> No. Come on, Cam.<eos> I have so many more questions for you now.
That's the way Mike was.<eos> He was a good guy.<eos> That was the killer's best shot.<eos> I'm not taking any chances, Cher.<eos> I'm putting you and your family into the highest level of safe house.
What do you propose, then?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Bring him in on a parking ticket, a house code violation, a broken tail light if you have to.<eos> Just bring him in.<eos> If he gets a restraining order against you, you're off the case and there's nothing I can do.
- The general's blood splattered all over<eos> - You can stop.<eos> the boy who was celebrating....<eos> You can stop!<eos> That must've been a nightmare for you, 'cause you love your dad.
Because I'm a woman?<eos> I didn't say that.<eos> Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, no.<eos> On second thought, I order you both to participate.<eos> On the one hand, you'll get a better handle on who Dustin's accomplice was if you're on the inside, and on the other hand, I think the aggression of the derby will be rather therapeutic for you, Dr. Brennan.
He's heading for the exit!<eos> Booth, it's okay-<eos> Bones, where are you?<eos> Stick with him, Bones!<eos> You got him! I'm coming for you, baby, I'm coming, Bones!
You were correct-- the derby was just what I needed.<eos> Well, I'm glad to hear it.<eos> You see, I think it's very therapeutic every now and then, to-to get out of your proverbial skin, yeah?<eos> Right.<eos> What about you, huh?
I got to get Bones here back to the lab.<eos> You're wearing your Jeffersonian lanyard.<eos> Are you coming in to help I.D. the jumper?<eos> Actually, I've hung up my lab coat.<eos> I never thought of you as one to retire.
It's obvious he really cared about what he was doing.<eos> I've never seen you get so emotional over a commercial before.<eos> Well, in this age of snark, I'm just thankful for someone with some good old-fashioned sincerity.<eos> Then I'll save the snark and get right to the point.<eos> Angela, I have a job for you.
Well, I must be in some serious heat if you brought in the big gun.<eos> Uh, actually, I'm the big gun on this.<eos> Uh, yeah, I know big guns, and you are not a big gun.<eos> Hey, you know I auditioned for the role of Agent Andy, right?<eos> I mean, I would have been playing you.
Sounds like Pamanther has a little explaining to do.<eos> And we know that you took an axe to Ron's script, turned it into quite the turd, if you ask me.<eos> Party Panthers was not a turd, okay?<eos> Well, it was because of you, and Ron was sick of it.<eos> So he decided to confront you, and that's when your famous temper took over.
Ron was coming back to work?<eos> This was supposed to be your time to shine, Linda.<eos> This was your chance to finally prove what you could do-- to finally, after all these years, crawl out from under your boss's big, looming shadow.<eos> And all you wanted was an opportunity to show yourself, your friends, your family that you had what it took.<eos> And here he was waltzing back in and throwing that big shadow right over you.
No, it doesn't.<eos> But it does mean that you're gonna become a full-fledged Supervisory Special Agent.<eos> Come on, what?<eos> They're promoting me?<eos> Look, the L.A. field office has been enquiring about you, so I said to myself, what better way to show them that you're qualified to do this by...
I hear, uh, it's a little bit lacking in the pizza department.<eos> Yeah, their pizza's really bad.<eos> You know what, you shouldn't take the job.<eos> Thanks, Booth.<eos> Thank you.
Oh, look at me.<eos> Then I will leave you to it.<eos> Oh, uh, thank you again for taking care of everything for Zack's hearing tomorrow.<eos> Dr. Hodgins and I have it covered.<eos> Besides, we have to get used to solving cases without you.
Told you.<eos> You came to the right woman.<eos> Okay, looks like this is done.<eos> So I'll call you the second that Kovac makes-- makes contact.<eos> Ooh, looks like Hodgins got you, too, huh?
I was going to say sick.<eos> Oh, Brennan...<eos> Oh... are you-- are you pregnant?<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm so happy for you.
- Thank goodness.<eos> What's up?<eos> Brennan's father came to me last night, and he's very worried.<eos> All right, look, I know that you take stock in all this stuff, and this mumbo-jumbo things, but if you tell Brennan that you're communing with Max, that's gonna be a problem.<eos> And that's why I've come to you.
You are in danger.<eos> Look, Bones, I know you don't believe in this stuff and neither do I, but my gut is telling me that something is wrong.<eos> All right?<eos> We're missing something.<eos> I mean, look, is it so wrong that I wanted to be near you and see you?
As if secret sodding Santa wasn't bad enough.<eos> It's good, love.<eos> Tasty.<eos> _ _<eos> '...but the only person I can talk to about you is you.
Tasty.<eos> _ _<eos> '...but the only person I can talk to about you is you.<eos> 'What we did today is without doubt... _<eos> 'I know nothing about you.
- Oh, classy.<eos> - You've heard of it?<eos> Well, yeah, of course.<eos> It crops up in the news all the time, doesn't it?<eos> Whenever there's something about genes or genomes or DNA, which, thanks to you, I now know aren't all the same thing.
Oh, good.<eos> I've never done anything like that before.<eos> You're married.<eos> So am I.<eos> Dear X, the only person I can talk to about you is you.
Yvonne it's going to be OK.<eos> It will.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You didn't sign up for this.<eos> I signed up for you.
There's no point, is there, for a virus?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Yeah, it'll just be a couple of weeks.<eos> Anyway, you and Chris.<eos> How come we always talk about me and we never talk about you?
She's... so lovely, Mum.<eos> Kind and funny.<eos> She can even sing like an angel.<eos> How stupid was I to ever think she'd want to hook up with a fuck-up like me?<eos> There'll be someone for you.
No. No, of course not.<eos> Dear X, I loved you touching me.<eos> Everywhere.<eos> I can't imagine that ever again.<eos> But I do still want you, just you.
But I do still want you, just you.<eos> And it's terrible because it keeps me feeling.<eos> And the only way I can see to get through this is to be numb.<eos> See ya!<eos> I think about you every single day.
You should know this... thing with Rosa.<eos> Whatever it is, it's not serious.<eos> Right.<eos> Are you sure she feels the same way?<eos> She knows how I feel about you, I've made it very clear...
Just stick to the story.<eos> Trust me.<eos> We weren't sleeping together.<eos> And if he'd told you we were, I think you'd be confronting me with details.<eos> Just for that moment I doubted you... Just for that split second.
Talking.<eos> That's not true!<eos> Sathnam always says he wishes his parents got on half as well as you and Dad.<eos> I'm not saying we don't get on.<eos> Oh... I'm so sorry, all of this is such terrible timing for you.
Dad asked me to get his number.<eos> The two of you have discussed it?<eos> You really think that I need help, making a good impression?<eos> Well, don't you?<eos> Er, shall I send it to you, or Dad?
Look, there is no need for that. She's not going to run away!<eos> This is crazy!<eos> I haven't done anything!<eos> I haven't done anything!<eos> I'll be right behind you in the car, love.
Facing the wrong way... Risk assessment.<eos> ...the phones, the safe house...<eos> Why?<eos> I believed you.<eos> Everything about you.
Thank you, Sergeant Johns.<eos> You may step down.<eos> Poor Sergeant Johns.<eos> Two weeks after I told you what George Selway did to me... you were in that pub with her.<eos> That's how much I mean to you.
Is... that what happened with George?<eos> I know you didn't mean to kill him.<eos> You wouldn't have let me drive you to his house... if you'd meant to kill him.<eos> Ijust wanted to teach him a lesson.<eos> For you.
In an hour, it will be 20,000.<eos> Every network is calling California for Vargas.<eos> California is over.<eos> California is done.<eos> America has made its choice, and it is not you.
60% of married adults have had an affair!<eos> - 60%!<eos> - Quinn!<eos> There is no replacing Frankie, but if anyone is qualified to uphold the values he held so dear, it's Vice President-Elect Cyrus Beene, the man Governor Vargas himself chose to be his successor in the event of such a tragedy.<eos> God bless you, and God bless America.
Liv.<eos> I wanted to offer my condolences.<eos> Thank you, Liv.<eos> That means a lot.<eos> I was worried about you.
He's really strong.<eos> He's knocked me down on the lacrosse field more than once.<eos> Now, when I see him coming, I do everything I can to get the hell out of the way.<eos> Brett actually started playing lacrosse for me.<eos> For you?
We should've called Stiles.<eos> We promised we wouldn't.<eos> It was a stupid promise.<eos> We almost lost him last time.<eos> Yeah, and now I'm gonna lose you, too.
We promised we wouldn't.<eos> It was a stupid promise.<eos> We almost lost him last time.<eos> Yeah, and now I'm gonna lose you, too.<eos> "You?" You're gonna lose...
I may be a sophisti-cat, but not so sophisticated as to forge something like that.<eos> Besides... what angle could I possibly have in coming here and telling you that it looks like your brother might just be alive?<eos> It's impossible.<eos> That's what I thought.<eos> Why'd he send it to you?
- Okay.<eos> Come here.<eos> I want you to go wash up, okay?<eos> And then you can catch up with your uncle.<eos> He hasn't just mythologized you.
There's a footage on here that proves that Noel's working with Charlotte.<eos> - I'm pregnant.<eos> - I'm here.<eos> Whatever you decide to do.<eos> I never wanna spend another day without you ever, for the rest of my life.
You know too much.<eos> I would never hurt you.<eos> I'm your mother.<eos> Mom?<eos> I'm not your mother, but I'm gonna take care of you like I was. What's your name?
Honey, Mary Drake will never bother you again.<eos> I will make sure of that.<eos> Your father and I...<eos> Please just stop.<eos> I was thinkin' about you the other day.
Emily and I were talking about how we could use social media.<eos> I just wanna say how great it is that Paige is really pitching in on this.<eos> Really taking the lead.<eos> Thanks, Alison. So...<eos> Seriously though, it's such a step forward for you.
- What was what about?<eos> We were in a teacher's lounge not the cafeteria before homeroom.<eos> And what is it, are you afraid of Paige or you just felt like punching a familiar face?<eos> I take that you and Sabrina are still on hold.<eos> See, this is the part of you that I hate.
Maybe you should ask my boss.<eos> Did you guys go see your boss?<eos> We couldn't even get there one day.<eos> Hit the brakes, what's happening?<eos> Katherine thinks I work for you.
I'm doing a fundraiser for my dad and I'd love to wear something new.<eos> I would be thrilled if you wore<eos> - one of my dresses.<eos> - Absolutely.<eos> This is a 45, and you were shot with a 22
It's kinda hard to forget when we're still standing here.<eos> It is crazy, isn't it?<eos> Em, I'm sorry.<eos> What I said in the teachers' lounge bringing up all that stuff about Alison.<eos> I know how much she means to you.
Don't apologize.<eos> It's my fault.<eos> I have this intense history with the both of you.<eos> You and Ali have your own weird history.<eos> When you told me what she did that night on my porch, I... I fell for you hard.
Hello, Spencer.<eos> Are you sure he's dead?<eos> If you're referring to Noel Kahn, yes.<eos> But if you'd like to make a statement, Jenna I'd recommend you...<eos> He wasn't just out to get you and your friend, Spencer.
I had to play along... And act like his partner.<eos> Are you implying that he put that gun in your hand?<eos> No.<eos> I brought it to protect myself.<eos> But everything I said to you and your friend, Spencer was for Noel's benefit, so...
How could she just walk in there?<eos> I'll tell you how, because she has balls the size of church bells. Okay.<eos> Well, I didn't need that image.<eos> Why didn't he just ask her who was shooting off the second gun?<eos> I'm sure he will, but he couldn't do that in front of you.
Aria?<eos> You okay?<eos> I-I should get going.<eos> I'll talk to you tomorrow?<eos> Oh, we never got around to discussing the menu for you and Ezra. Yeah.
Hey, Carly, would you mind giving us a moment?<eos> Thanks.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> What is this about?<eos> This is about you, and where you were yesterday when you were supposed to be here.
So where were you?<eos> Where were you that was more important than being here with me?<eos> I was looking for Mary.<eos> I-I wanted to be here, believe me...<eos> But after everything I put you and your mother through I won't let that woman do any more damage to this family.
I was looking for Mary.<eos> I-I wanted to be here, believe me...<eos> But after everything I put you and your mother through I won't let that woman do any more damage to this family.<eos> I know you're confused and you're hurt.<eos> I still can't explain what I did but as big as a mistake as it was and, Spencer, it was huge, I know that. I don't regret what happened because we ended up with you.
And then what?<eos> Are you gonna chase her away so that I never get to see her again?<eos> That's the plan, isn't it?<eos> Spencer!<eos> I know this hasn't been easy on you keeping this secret from me but you won't have to do it for much longer.
But, hey...<eos> Look, we talked for a while.<eos> She says that she wants me to be happy.<eos> I am sorry. I have been such a crappy fiance.<eos> But I, I hope you realize that with her being here, her being alive it doesn't change a thing about how I feel about you.
No, at her parents...<eos> When they came to take her back.<eos> Did Nicole write this?<eos> "This memory of us kept me alive."<eos> I can't tell you how many nights I thought about you and our love, and I knew that I had to be strong.
- Good.<eos> Let's take the scenic route.<eos> Is beer alright?<eos> Sure, anything.<eos> I was hoping to hear from you soon, but I didn't expect today.
So what happens next?<eos> How do I get out?<eos> There is no out.<eos> But you could change sides, be a part of the winning team.<eos> You want me to join you in torturing my friends?
How do I get out?<eos> There is no out.<eos> But you could change sides, be a part of the winning team.<eos> You want me to join you in torturing my friends?<eos> You and whoever's on the other end of that ear piece.
- That I needed to talk to her.<eos> That I have questions and they need answers.<eos> Mary is dangerous, Spencer.<eos> - She cannot be trusted.<eos> - And you can?
- Right?<eos> - Why wait to celebrate?<eos> There's a bottle of bubbly in the fridge.<eos> Oh, I'll get glasses.<eos> Babe, I'm so proud of you.
Oh, I'll get glasses.<eos> Babe, I'm so proud of you.<eos> Well, you have to be proud of Mona too.<eos> She really came through on this one.<eos> Well, when I see her, I will shake her hand but right now, you get a kiss.
Did you go for the fancy stuff?<eos> No, I prefer full-strength.<eos> Thought so.<eos> Excuse me, two coffees, black.<eos> So... I hadn't heard back from you.
I thought we might engage in some recreation, yes.<eos> How do you feel about ping-pong?<eos> Oh, that's the plan.<eos> We're gonna volunteer for a few hours work with some kids take my mind off of my troubles.<eos> Are you always this cynical when someone tries to do something nice for you?
Hanna, I don't want you worrying about...<eos> Lucas, I have to know what the stakes are!<eos> My company can absorb the loss, Hanna.<eos> 'There's a thousand ways that I could write this off.'<eos> And besides, I would not have invested in you unless I believed in a positive outcome.
I can see why she wants to leave it up.<eos> It's been there for years.<eos> They left it that way after Gloriana passed.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Was she special to you?
We can stay as long as you want.<eos> So beautiful.<eos> I've been so caught up in my own soap opera lately I forgot that I'm not the first person to have a complicated story about a birth mother and a surrogate mother.<eos> You don't have to drive yourself crazy choosing between the two.<eos> All you have to do is love the people that want the best for you.
Guess she tried to get a hold of you...<eos> Anyways, she got this apprenticeship with some hot, new baker in Atlanta and she has to be there tomorrow but she referred some replacements so do I call them?<eos> I mean, how do you even interview a baker?<eos> Ezra, I've never run a business before and... I really wanna help you, I just, I don't... I don't know what, exactly what to do.<eos> Things are just kind of unraveling without you here and I just, I really wish that...
I don't think that she would have self-sabotaged that night if it wasn't for everything going on with the three of us.<eos> I was there behind the door when you were begging her to let you in.<eos> She was a mess.<eos> I promised her I was over you<eos> I gave her permission to fall in love with you.
The thing is, if I can get him alone I'm pretty sure that I can convince him to drop.<eos> Yeah, that is a bad idea.<eos> Why?<eos> I know that he still cares about me.<eos> Okay, don't overestimate someone's feeling's for you.
I'm not Nicole.<eos> I'm telling her I'm not doing it.<eos> No, I want you to do it.<eos> Selling this book will help us build a better future together.<eos> Without you, this book wouldn't even exist.
I'm the same person that I was three days ago, Marco.<eos> I'm the same person that you brought dinner to and you played ping pong with and the same person that you kissed.<eos> Well, that might be true.<eos> But it turns out I didn't know that person much.<eos> Well, I know you.
What?<eos> Well, you say you wanna do things and you end up bailing.<eos> Get a grip, they're just vitamins.<eos> It's not about the vitamins, okay?<eos> I'm looking down the road and what I see is you tossing me the baby and runnin' off to Paris.
Mona, you know that I want that but the others can't find out that you're involved.<eos> You didn't tell them that I know about the game.<eos> I couldn't.<eos> They still don't trust me?<eos> Fine, I'll help you and your friends like I always do and then crawl back under a rock.
But why is the factory for sale?<eos> And was our business partnership ever real?<eos> I think you're so talented, Hanna.<eos> I just...<eos> I had trouble getting other people to take a chance on you.
Aria definitely did it to herself.<eos> Okay, but if A.D. hadn't gotten Aria to do what she did they'd have found a way to force another one of us, too.<eos> I mean, you should know that better than anyone else.<eos> Meaning what?<eos> Meaning that A.D. convinced you to play the game first.
Is that who Hanna's covering for?<eos> I cannot believe that you told my mom.<eos> It's called the truth.<eos> I think it's something, we all need to become a little more familiar with.<eos> Yeah, easy for you to say.
- No.<eos> No, you do not.<eos> Okay?<eos> I was scared.<eos> And I've done some... really terrible things to you and everyone else.
And guess what?<eos> - You won.<eos> - What?<eos> I don't...<eos> Your grand prize, chosen especially for you is an unlimited supply of freedom.
What, you think you know who A.D. is?<eos> I have a short list, starting with Jenna Marshall and ending in Mary Drake.<eos> Okay.<eos> You know what, we don't need your theories.<eos> And there's no piece on that board that looks like you.
Um, yeah.<eos> I-I mean, I heard.<eos> But Hanna and I didn't have anything to do with it.<eos> She only came to pick me up...<eos> Caleb, Detective Furey keeps circling back to you.
I think burying a dead body in my yard is plenty.<eos> I didn't have a choice.<eos> If it wasn't Jessica it would have me six feet under.<eos> I knew what you two were planning.<eos> Six feet isn't deep enough for you.
You still have doubts about me of whether you can trust me or not?<eos> - Ezra.<eos> - No-no.<eos> I-I get it.<eos> Maybe there's some part of you that has never forgiven me for taking advantage of you and your friends for the sake of a bark.
I-I get it.<eos> Maybe there's some part of you that has never forgiven me for taking advantage of you and your friends for the sake of a bark.<eos> Look, Ezra, that's...<eos> I wish that I could change history but I can't.<eos> I fell in love with you, Aria.
- Please forgive me.<eos> - Forgive you?<eos> Oh, honey.<eos> You're just a selfish little bitch.<eos> I wouldn't piss on you if you were on fire.
I want to see where she's going, don't you?<eos> Thank you for coming.<eos> Um, I'm sorry, but I thought you'd left.<eos> I remembered some unfinished business.<eos> I have something for you, a going-away gift.
I have something for you, a going-away gift.<eos> You're smiling.<eos> I just, I didn't think to get you anything.<eos> You're not the one leaving.<eos> It's something for you and Alison.
I owe you so much.<eos> So much more.<eos> I owe you an entire life.<eos> I wish there was something that I could do.<eos> Something to change everything for you and Alison and your friends.
There's always been somebody watching.<eos> Manipulating.<eos> This is Rosewood, Mona, not Area 51.<eos> Finish your pie.<eos> I don't want anything from you.
Yes, okay, the body is a problem but more importantly... I can't leave my friends.<eos> I think they gave up the right to be your friends.<eos> No, they haven't.<eos> I'm the one who made the bad choice.<eos> When someone puts you in a box and nails the lid shut part of you will always be locked in that box in the dark afraid and crying, but... you can't let that trap part do the thinking for you.
How?<eos> I have a masters degree in American literature.<eos> There is nothing I can't handle.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> He's coming for you.
Oh, no.<eos> He's coming for you.<eos> We have to go.<eos> Now, Ali.<eos> Ali, we came back for you, so move it.
Alison wouldn't let me.<eos> Why did you want to visit me?<eos> The same reason you came here.<eos> To see if there was anything to worry about.<eos> I didn't visit, but I kept an eye on you.
The same reason you came here.<eos> To see if there was anything to worry about.<eos> I didn't visit, but I kept an eye on you.<eos> I watched for five years.<eos> Five years of you making the doctors feel so clever with all the progress you were making.
Not only did you lose the game but you lost the story.<eos> It's mine, everything is mine.<eos> God, I hate this town.<eos> I guess I'm gonna have to do something about that too.<eos> Am I supposed to be afraid of you?
Try and remember that.<eos> Lieutenant Tanner!<eos> I wanna talk to her, please.<eos> It is better if you don't.<eos> She did this for you.
- We found Michael.<eos> Never thought I'd see this face again.<eos> You weren't supposed to.<eos> I own you, Scofield.<eos> If you're planning something, I'll always be a step ahead of you.
I knew I was being set up.<eos> Michael, he's with our son right now.<eos> Scofield was looking for a partner, combing prisons, looking for someone who could handle himself.<eos> What are you trying to tell me?<eos> It was ingrained in you, son.
There's no leaving 21-Void, Van.<eos> How about you just shut up and pay me, Burrows?<eos> I don't have it.<eos> You know who I am?<eos> I'm gonna get you and your mother out of here.
How does freeing a man like Abu Ramal advance this country's cause?<eos> Well, it doesn't.<eos> The missions before, they were for the good of the country, but...<eos> No, this one wasn't about country.<eos> It was about you.
And if it's any solace, our son won't be one of them.<eos> While the cat's away, the mice will play.<eos> Something's wrong.<eos> I got your map.<eos> I'm gonna get you and your mother out of here.
No, no, no, it's me. What's going on?<eos> They're shooting.<eos> I'm scared.<eos> - Okay.<eos> They've come for you.
I let you down, Michael.<eos> I should have taken care of Luca when I had the chance.<eos> You didn't let me down.<eos> You couldn't have known.<eos> We're so close because of you, Linc.
It's a glorious thing indeed.<eos> Even if I don't have a damn clue how to deal with it.<eos> You and me both.<eos> I've got a way to get our son back, Sara.<eos> I've been planning to bring Jacob down ever since he forced me to turn my back on you and Mike.
It's because I love you.<eos> And they're trying to hurt me... Take the one thing that I truly love away.<eos> Why would they try and hurt you?<eos> Because there are some things I haven't told you about me.<eos> I sent that letter to you for a reason.
I know this is gonna be hard to believe, but I'm basically a secret agent.<eos> Come on in.<eos> You know that fort you've got in the backyard?<eos> It feels good to go somewhere like that, right?<eos> A place no one knows about, where no one can get to you.
It's okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Would you please show him your credentials, Agent Blake?<eos> Agent Emily Blake, CIA.<eos> I'm sorry that had to happen in front of you at the house.
Worst part is that this particular one dredged up the memory of your father.<eos> The truth is, Mikey, despite what you may want to believe, your father died seven years ago.<eos> Yeah.<eos> This is Michael Scofield.<eos> We were just talking about you.
You and your damn zoo, Scofield.<eos> I'm gonna find out once and for all what you were really doing there.<eos> What you were really planning.<eos> And then I'm gonna kill you.<eos> I know everything about you.
In plain sight, yet so mysterious.<eos> The secret to real power is to never betray your intentions.<eos> To wear nothing on your sleeve, and to never let anyone see your face.<eos> _<eos> I'll always be a step ahead of you.
Enough to send you away forever.<eos> Bravo, Michael.<eos> However you got in there, bravo.<eos> You sent me to the zoo so you could get into my office.<eos> But you and I both know your threat's a hollow one, because you know I've got something that's even more valuable to you: your son.
Time for the real dance to begin, am I right?<eos> We're going to get him back, okay?<eos> We got your wild card ready to go.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Me that should be thanking you.
I'll find them.<eos> I'll destroy them.<eos> Like I said, I'm holding the cards.<eos> Whoa! Didn't expect that.<eos> It's beneath you, Michael.
Up ahead, in the next bay.<eos> I'll take that call.<eos> We got him, Michael.<eos> We got our boy.<eos> Good news for you.
We got him, Michael.<eos> We got our boy.<eos> Good news for you.<eos> But now you've got no reason to give me what I want.<eos> Which kind of makes it bad news for you.
- Nice to meet you.<eos> - Nice to meet you.<eos> Sorry, who would ditch you? I don't...<eos> I can't make the connection right now.<eos> Who would humiliate you?
- Hey, you all right?<eos> What's going on?<eos> - Chase seems like a keeper.<eos> What did he say to you?<eos> He spoke very highly of you.
- Okay. What, you want me to leave?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> So you can go hang out with Chase?<eos> Are you serious?<eos> Has this just been about sex for you this whole time?
Hey.<eos> Look, let me just start by saying...<eos> I get why you acted the way you did at the party.<eos> I'm sorry, but for what it's worth, that guy Chase...<eos> - The way he talked about you...
I'm not your girlfriend at all.<eos> I'm some whore you knocked up and then left and tried to ignore.<eos> Honestly, Holly, what do you want from me?<eos> Okay, I'm 17. Look at where I live!<eos> Think I can support you and a kid?
Did Holly know about your allergy?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Maybe.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Does any part of you think that this wasn't an accident?
I slept with Holly.<eos> I know.<eos> She showed me pictures.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Pictures of you sleeping.
Are you okay, babe?<eos> No, no, not really.<eos> I know how much it hurts when you lose something so special.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I want you to know... I'm here for you.
- He tried to tell me.<eos> Yeah, he did, so why didn't you just listen to him?<eos> I mean, you believed everything I said.<eos> Even the baby.<eos> - What does that say about you?
Are you okay?<eos> Elizabeth, what's going on?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Behind you.
What did you do to her?<eos> I think it's better, just the two of us. Just like that weekend away.<eos> You, me, in bed together.<eos> Nobody else mattered in the whole world.<eos> You can't look at these photos and tell me that they mean nothing to you.
It's all right.<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> She killed her.<eos> Tyler.<eos> I got something for you.
Liar.<eos> Please, don't do anything you're gonna regret.<eos> Now see, I was even gonna let you live.<eos> Crazy, right?<eos> 'Cause it was just so obvious that Tyler loves me more than he loves you.
"Mercy."<eos> Why not just kill me?<eos> Because I'm not like you.<eos> I'm stronger than you.<eos> My life is no longer linked to you, and the city that you like to say you built... it's mine.
That makes you special for reasons that are too complicated to explain.<eos> - I don't care about your problems.<eos> - You should.<eos> Because there are others who know how important you are.<eos> And they will come for you.
You think I don't know.<eos> The day after I bit Elijah he should have died.<eos> But his sire line is still out there.<eos> So I had Vincent cast a spell to figure out how that could be.<eos> It turns out the lines of your siblings are anchored to you.
To defeat him, you need me.<eos> You're offering me a deal?<eos> One you cannot dismiss.<eos> Alistair and his ilk loathed me because of my strength.<eos> Now they loathe you.
What have you gotten yourself into, Marcel?<eos> - You about to start a war?<eos> - No.<eos> If this goes the way I expect, I won't have to lift a finger.<eos> All I need from you is a boundary spell.
Half-starved. I should just kill him.<eos> After all, a wise man said,<eos> "One cannot be free if one's oppressors continue to live."<eos> And what I've learned is, the best way to end your fear is to face it yourself.<eos> So, for you, a gift, the sword that you gave me, now laced with my venom.
While I remain here, my enemies will flock to New Orleans, causing all manner of mischief.<eos> One day, most likely as a result of some fool's effort to reach me, I will escape, and I will seek my own justice.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I had a friend once, Cami.<eos> She, uh... she believed with all her heart that you had some good left in you.
There's something we need you to look into.<eos> First, tell me how my friends are.<eos> Did everyone make it?<eos> Clarke?<eos> I'm here, thanks to you.
Are forbidden.<eos> I have to leave this place, John.<eos> So, what, you're gonna bail on me again?<eos> I didn't bail on you.<eos> I came back, took the damn chip because Jaha said he would take me to you.
It almost broke your mother to send you away.<eos> Killing Lexa in soulou gonplei was to be your triumphant return, but you lost.<eos> Our war chiefs don't respect you.<eos> Then I'll get new war chiefs.<eos> The army is loyal to them, not you.
It is, of course, a great compliment to your race.<eos> Though, if your vanquishing had come a bit sooner, I would not have complained.<eos> "It is the fate of a man like myself to be misunderstood."<eos> That's Goethe, in case you were wondering.<eos> I've always been proud of you, buddy.
The local yokels get worked up, cause even more trouble, and you know...<eos> And people get hung.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Nice to see you.<eos> You haven't aged a day.
Don't be shy.<eos> Hell of a speech, Colonel.<eos> A real inspiration.<eos> Oh, thanks, John.<eos> That means a lot coming from you.
But she sends hugs.<eos> Now, you know me, I enjoy people, but your mother is selfish.<eos> Do you think we wanted to stay in the Valley?<eos> North Hollywood.<eos> But... with this and school for you and Kelly, only thing we can afford.
- We'll get it for you. - That's it?<eos> No, you're definitely judged.<eos> When you eat, points magically appear.<eos> What he means is, if you're maintaining or moving towards your goal, you go up a level.<eos> - How you do it is up to you.
Ellen is an artist.<eos> She's extremely bright and sensitive.<eos> She was never going to go into Chinese<eos> - or computers or what have you.<eos> - What? Is that what you think your dad wants for you?
I didn't abandon my daughter.<eos> I love her more than life.<eos> I just didn't know what to do.<eos> She's dying right in front of us.<eos> What's going on with you right now?
Come on, get it on you.<eos> Right?<eos> Okay.<eos> Now, a little bite... for me.<eos> - For you? - Mm-hmm.
- I...<eos> I need to do my research.<eos> And you... need to be touched by someone who actually cares about you.<eos> Luke...<eos> I'm falling in love with you.
Oh, okay.<eos> This rexie girl, who saw my stuff on Tumblr, liked the way I saw... so much, that when she slit her wrists, she left me the fucking note.<eos> And you know what her parents did?<eos> They sent me pictures... so I'd really know what I'd done.<eos> People say they love you... but what they mean is, they love how loving you makes them feel about themselves. Or... Or they love what they can take from you.
The first spanking, when your heart went on a journey all alone.<eos> When they called you 'crybaby' or 'poor' or 'fatty' or 'crazy'... and made you into an alien... "you drank their acid and you concealed it."<eos> "Later, if you faced the death of bombs and bullets..." you did not do it with a banner.<eos> You did it with only a hat to cover your heart.<eos> You did not fondle the weakness inside you though it was there.
But...<eos> Well, as she said it, I felt real clarity that that's what we need.<eos> Can I think about it?<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> There's, uh... not much left of you to lose.
And...<eos> I just want you to know that... I accept it if...<eos> If death is what you want, I accept it now.<eos> I accept it, but um... I love you.<eos> I just... I can't keep fighting you.
Focus this time, M.K. Ready?<eos> Go!<eos> Go again.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I should report you for making contact.
Everybody thinks Quinn died by your hand, and Jacobee, too.<eos> Now you control three territories.<eos> You have the respect of your clippers, and all the other barons.<eos> And you made a believer out of me.<eos> I couldn't have done any of this without you.
All of our conversations?<eos> She wanted to know about your progress.<eos> It's my job.<eos> I'm your Abbot.<eos> I trusted you, Ava.
Are you ready?<eos> For what?<eos> The hard part.<eos> Very important.<eos> How about you?
Who knows what might rise from the ashes?<eos> These people, they don't know how to live free.<eos> We have to teach them.<eos> That's why I need somebody who will treat his Barony with fairness and equality.<eos> Someone who answers to you.
Someone who answers to you.<eos> A puppet.<eos> Call it what you like.<eos> You'll have your own territory, your own Clippers...<eos> What makes you so sure I won't use those Clippers against you?
Put it down, Quinn.<eos> If you had the heart to kill me, you would have done it already.<eos> My first bride.<eos> I want to thank you.<eos> After everything we've been through together, I truly would not be the man I am without you.
I came back for you.<eos> I sacrificed my own Gift to save you.<eos> Please!<eos> You came back for the book.<eos> It's what he was using me for all along, just like he's been using you.
- Let him go.<eos> You got what you wanted.<eos> Now you're going to translate it for me.<eos> If this book holds all the Gifts' secrets, one of them must tell you how to get it back.<eos> There's no hope for you.
Seems like we found our way into The Widow's heart.<eos> Who are you?<eos> I'm a friend of M.K.'s.<eos> Maybe the only friend he has left in the world, now that Sunny's charged off to some tragically noble end.<eos> No thanks to you, of course.
Yeah?<eos> Well, meet Sarah.<eos> Hey.<eos> Good job, Bear.<eos> Really happy for you, Bear.
It's a girl.<eos> Wow.<eos> We're having a little girl.<eos> That's great news.<eos> Good for you, Bear.
Wow.<eos> We're having a little girl.<eos> That's great news.<eos> Good for you, Bear.<eos> - Good for you.
I should never have taken your bloody money.<eos> Why don't you look at me when I talk to you?<eos> Are you even listening to me?<eos> I won't be silenced.<eos> Not even by you.
You betrayed your troop chief.<eos> You might as well have gut-shot him.<eos> I didn't tell Rip anything he didn't know himself.<eos> That's why he left.<eos> You lose it like he did, I'll do the same thing to you.
- Look, I got ask... you sign your separation papers yet?<eos> I was about to.<eos> We can't get Rip if you're not there.<eos> The new guy is not ready, okay?<eos> And I don't know if I can handle Caulder's bullshit without you.
Bear...<eos> I don't have a choice, man.<eos> Anabel's school deposit is due next month.<eos> I have to take this job.<eos> I know this is a tough call for you, all right?
- Yeah, of course.<eos> About the benefit package...<eos> I hear you have, uh, a tuition assistance plan?<eos> Correct... for approved educational institutions.<eos> Now, if you don't have any other questions for me, I have one for you.
_<eos> _<eos> Special soldier!<eos> More of you come?<eos> Come for you?
Is this true?<eos> No.<eos> It's not true.<eos> I need you to be more positive.<eos> I don't work for you anymore, so what you need isn't my problem.
He does know I'm white?<eos> "Nazi."<eos> You know, you do atrocities like kill women and children.<eos> Is that what you think of me?<eos> No, I just don't think of you.
Yeah.<eos> So what do you want to do, huh?<eos> You in, or you out?<eos> What's in it for me?<eos> What's in it for you?
I'd argue he's no use to anybody, but he's still the father of my son, so... I need him alive.<eos> Well, if he'd stayed out of it, my money would still be in that safe.<eos> He didn't take the money out of the safe. Audrey did.<eos> This is between our two families.<eos> Julia, there's a door behind you.
Why don't you tell me what it is, honey?<eos> If I'd have listened to you, Marius, I'd have lost all my money, hmm?<eos> But of course that was the plan, wasn't it?<eos> Feeding me the cards. Wasn't it?<eos> Hmm? What I want from you now is to finally drop the con and admit... that I fucking got you.
Eddie.<eos> Eddie, why do you think you weren't kissed in all of this?<eos> Because you figured you couldn't trust me.<eos> - I get it.<eos> - I do trust you.
Eddie, why do you think you weren't kissed in all of this?<eos> Because you figured you couldn't trust me.<eos> - I get it.<eos> - I do trust you.<eos> Eddie, I trust you.
Let's start with that.<eos> Hey.<eos> I was asleep.<eos> Right.<eos> You, uh... You asked me to trust you. I didn't.
No.<eos> It wasn't easy arranging to introduce ourselves, either.<eos> - Gina.<eos> - Doesn't matter. You don't know us.<eos> But we know a lot about you.
I want you to remember where that is when you walk back here, okay?<eos> Esther.<eos> Come here.<eos> Na'omi, what happened to you doesn't matter.<eos> Nobody's gonna think less of you.
No. No. I...<eos> I need you to make him think that you like him. - No!<eos> - Think of the girls.<eos> Esther could be next, trust me.<eos> Why trust you?
We are not going back inside that cell.<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> They're gonna kill us.<eos> I'm worth $10 million.<eos> They'll kill you.
Remember, Michael, the words of the prophet,<eos> "alayhi as-salam"...<eos> "the world is just a moment, so make it a moment of obedience."<eos> Of course.<eos> I owe everything to you.
I'll be right up.<eos> So, are we still on for lunch Tuesday?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> And, Paige, thank you... for everything.<eos> No, thank you for cleaning up that mess McGill left behind.
What?<eos> God must be laughing.<eos> I'm a SEAL, and my sperm can't even swim.<eos> Joseph...<eos> Joseph, this is not about you or God.
Put him in.<eos> You will not silence us.<eos> You will never silence us!<eos> Terry McAlwain, your company refuses to pay.<eos> All this money for oil and none for you.
Missed you guys.<eos> I told them about buck.<eos> Are you okay, dad? Sure.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I don't want it to be you, dad.
Tell me about your day.<eos> Dude, where are the jell-o shots when you need them? I don't know.<eos> Hey, Alex.<eos> Did you bring a date to this?<eos> I mean, that is a new low... Even for you.
The box of Buckley's stuff? Right this way.<eos> Thank you, Lena.<eos> Testing.<eos> I love you, tammi. I do.<eos> I just... I don't know if I can trust you.
We're not boko haram.<eos> We never really got around to introducing each other. I'm Michael.<eos> That's akmal, ex-spetsnaz, and straight-up og.<eos> So that's us.<eos> Why don't you tell us something about you?
Me, I killed three for, what, chase, 20 bucks an hour?<eos> Well, given the travel time, we're looking at $18.<eos> See, we don't do it for the money.<eos> Neither did our buddy.<eos> See, he didn't die for money or you or whatever it is you wannabe gi Joes do for a living or the flag or the stock market.
Not a day goes by I don't think about 'em.<eos> These decisions... Most men never have to face.<eos> But if you do make them, you've got to make peace with them.<eos> Right here, right now.<eos> 'Cause if you hold on to 'em like... Like I did, they're just gonna tear you apart... Tear apart your family.
How does it feel knowing you stood by doing absolutely nothing?<eos> I will never forgive myself.<eos> Ever.<eos> Good.<eos> But I might forgive you.
Captain Pearson had a few questions about how things were handled.<eos> He recommended that you take a few weeks off, but I said no.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> Can I trust you to keep it together?<eos> Look me in the eye and tell me I can trust you.
But then you told me I had to be strong for the girls.<eos> And so I was.<eos> Now you have to be strong for them.<eos> I don't care what that man says.<eos> I know one thing for sure about you.
You are the lucky one.<eos> Why?<eos> Because you have nothing to lose.<eos> Judge Martinez and her husband came to dinner.<eos> They asked after you.
With all of these new recruits you're bringing us, gonna make a lot more of these teams.<eos> American ones.<eos> To bring on you what you bring on us.<eos> Michael, what you've done with the SEAL, all of these new recruits...<eos> I was wrong to doubt you.
So then why do you go and you kill their leader and his men?<eos> I made a tactical decision.<eos> It wasn't safe to come...<eos> I raised you up like Lazarus out of the gutter!<eos> They all wanted me to kill you, but I saw something in you.
If we have to leave Chad, the prince is going to kill both of us.<eos> I remember the first day I saw you killing a man for stealing your shoes.<eos> I knew then that you had the will that my son lacked.<eos> I knew then that such...<eos> Such fire in you would be great to join with this intelligence...
I knew then that you had the will that my son lacked.<eos> I knew then that such...<eos> Such fire in you would be great to join with this intelligence...<eos> That you would be the lion the cause needed.<eos> But I also saw this rage inside of you.
Such fire in you would be great to join with this intelligence...<eos> That you would be the lion the cause needed.<eos> But I also saw this rage inside of you.<eos> Because of Omar, that rage has endangered our cause.<eos> Everything I've done, I've done for you.
Kill her.<eos> Kill me.<eos> Kill everybody in that room.<eos> 'Cause America's coming for me.<eos> And they're coming for you.
All right, this guy he wants to be the next Osama Bin Laden.<eos> Meet your new cellmate.<eos> You were right...<eos> Boko Haram does want him.<eos> My brother died for you.
I'll leave you two be.<eos> Let me know if you need anything, sir.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - Sorry, how did I end up with you again?<eos> You asked for the State Department's help.<eos> I wanted the State Department, not you.
Nice knowing you, Benjamin.<eos> I hope next time it's under better circumstances.<eos> - Pay up.<eos> - You have to get us past the checkpoint.<eos> Two Americans... we'll never make it without you.
Finally find God?<eos> Not your God.<eos> There is only one God.<eos> We're gonna take the city, you know.<eos> You be nice... maybe I'll make a good woman of you.
Not your God.<eos> There is only one God.<eos> We're gonna take the city, you know.<eos> You be nice... maybe I'll make a good woman of you.<eos> Forgive the devil in you.
I don't know.<eos> I-I was supposed to do this a week ago, but then this happened with my daughter.<eos> Thank God you found us.<eos> There's still time to do it.<eos> They're waiting for you in there.
But this may be too late.<eos> Ramadan has begun.<eos> The guards are releasing the prisoners.<eos> Abu Ramal and his men, they'll kill me.<eos> And you.
All of our plans, the passports, the shop, everything is probably under rubble by now.<eos> I got someone on it.<eos> What, the kid you throw planes to?<eos> No.<eos> I'm talking about the only person I trust in the world as much as I trust you.
It was honest bargaining, friend.<eos> I took nothing.<eos> Besides, your passport is long gone, somewhere far overseas by now, I bet.<eos> If you want, um, I can have the forgers make you another.<eos> My own fake passport coming from you?
Christian, Army.<eos> - Seems pretty up front to me.<eos> - Did he happen to tell you about some of the arrests he and his brother made<eos> - at their security checkpoint?<eos> - No, focused on you.
That's why they're here.<eos> Wearing a cross is one thing.<eos> - Living by it is another.<eos> - All right, okay, sure.<eos> Just promise me I can trust you, that we're still doing this tonight.
And in two hours when those lights go black, we're gonna disappear from this place like ghosts.<eos> Yeah, all right.<eos> Sheba!<eos> Who are these men you work with?<eos> They're beneath you.
- I'm not much of a brother.<eos> - Sure.<eos> Point is that I had zero, nobody, till you recruited me.<eos> When you pulled me out of that prison in the Ozarks, you had integrity.<eos> I know we were doing CIA work, sure, you know, pulling their people out, but it was about you and me, and having each other's back.
Get out!<eos> What are you doing in this cell?<eos> They're on the roof!<eos> Don't shoot!<eos> I trusted you, Kaniel Outis.
I'm putting you in danger by saying this, but maybe it doesn't matter because I'll be dead, and they'll leave you alone.<eos> But I love you.<eos> You see, I loved you.<eos> I never stopped loving you.<eos> This whole lie, it was for you.
We should let them go, right?<eos> Like, if we were at all good people, we'd want them to be free of us.<eos> Maybe.<eos> What did you do to him?<eos> I-I assume there's a reason that he went all frat boy on you.
It was before I knew what happened.<eos> Or I'm just a horrible person.<eos> You're not.<eos> I am.<eos> Whatever you need or decide, I'm here for you, okay?
No matter how high or how far we climb, they gonna find a way to pull us back down.<eos> I have a plan.<eos> If I compel them to disclose Hannah as their source, I can undermine her testimony completely.<eos> She accused you of killing Sam.<eos> It all speaks to her bias against you.
- No.<eos> - You can tell them that you cleared her phone because she threatened you.<eos> - She didn't.<eos> - You can get immunity.<eos> - And what about you?
It should have been you.<eos> He'd still be alive if you would have just stayed away.<eos> But he's dead.<eos> I don't blame Annalise for that.<eos> I blame you, 'cause it's always you.
He'd still be alive if you would have just stayed away.<eos> But he's dead.<eos> I don't blame Annalise for that.<eos> I blame you, 'cause it's always you.<eos> I loved him so much more than I have ever loved you.
When he was charged with attempting to murder his father...<eos> Got him out on parole.<eos> After that, you gave him a job, brought him into your home.<eos> A little unorthodox.<eos> Was he working as an investigator for you?
We know you know, Oliver.<eos> You told them.<eos> Don't look at him.<eos> Right here.<eos> This is clearly a stressful time for you, as it is for all of us, and I'm sorry about that.
That camera shows Wes got in your car at 4:24 p.m., but the house didn't explode until a few hours later.<eos> What happened in between?<eos> I'm done.<eos> Seriously.<eos> Release me, call a public defender to get you off my back, but I'm done being interrogated.
Oh, my God, you've lost it.<eos> I am the only one holding us together right now.<eos> Because you're acting like Mussolini right now.<eos> Mussolini got things done, didn't he?<eos> It may come as a surprise to you, but I was not always the glue that held this group together.
Shut up and act normal.<eos> Did you find anything yet?<eos> Look at that.<eos> Either the D.A.'s office is out of options or they decided to send in the big guns.<eos> Nice to see you, too.
That's what I've been trying to say.<eos> BonBon?<eos> You were right.<eos> They're not going to stop.<eos> Even if they charge Frank for Wes, they're just going to keep coming at you.
We've told you everything we're willing to tell you without a deal.<eos> One of your own students.<eos> An orphan who fought his way through a difficult foster-care system to become something.<eos> Ms. Keating is clearly devastated by the loss of her student.<eos> You were his professor, and he trusted you.
That's where I carry all my stress.<eos> As my lady commands.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> Is Michaela behind you to threaten me again?
In the basement.<eos> He ran out of the storm door.<eos> He did this.<eos> Annalise uses you.<eos> You do whatever she wants because you know she'll get rid of you otherwise.
Is it 'cause she a lawyer?<eos> Is that why you keep suckin' up?<eos> 'Cause I've been your roomie for months now, and you don't give no kinds of damn about my case.<eos> Wrong.<eos> I don't give a damn about you.
I don't give a damn about you.<eos> Yeah, whatever.<eos> You cracked if you think Queen Elizabeth here ever gonna help you with your case?<eos> And why wouldn't I?<eos> Maybe I'd help you, too, if you shut your mouth for once.
He wasn't my child!<eos> Keep coming at me.<eos> Come on.<eos> Maybe I will murder someone.<eos> Annalise the Hood-rat, that's my new name for you.
Did that include any of Annalise's personal case files?<eos> No.<eos> Just the clinic.<eos> Good job.<eos> I have a question for you, son.
Okay.<eos> Whatever.<eos> A toast!<eos> To Oli, for being a great liar, and most importantly, to Wes.<eos> We might not have given you the proper memorial, but... we can still pour one out for you.
I was just remembering how Laurel went off on all those crying people at Wes' memorial.<eos> And then I got called into the police station and I lied to their faces.<eos> Aw, are you worried about me?<eos> Nah.<eos> Just learning a lot about you.
Bonnie said you've been holding everyone up.<eos> That doesn't surprise me.<eos> I'm just... sorry that you're in this position.<eos> But it is what it is right now.<eos> You're the one they listen to, so...
Okay, I'm being naive.<eos> And yet, here I am, going through her phone records because you wanted me to.<eos> By the way, you never told me that she called you over to the house that night.<eos> Uh, yeah, I did.<eos> No, I knew she left a message for Laurel and Wes, but not you.
You've been through a lot.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Good.<eos> I'll tell Frank.<eos> He asked about you.
You are suspended!<eos> You will give me those records so I can prepare for what is coming down the line.<eos> I can tell you what's coming.<eos> This was the only way we could get at Atwood.<eos> And it's gonna hit her harder than it hits you.
I get it.<eos> You don't need to cry about him in front of me.<eos> But I do need you to take action.<eos> Yeah, I do need you to be the person that you promised us you were.<eos> You know, that's why we've been following you this whole time and trusting you.
That saves me about an hour.<eos> The rest of you, dig into the discovery of my case... Police records, interviews.<eos> Chances are Atwood doctored some of those, too.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> That's not for you.
- You need to go and kill yourself.<eos> - Laurel, stop.<eos> That's the one good thing you're gonna do in your life.<eos> You're gonna go, and you're gonna kill yourself, Connor!<eos> Today's a good day for you.
- I never killed anyone.<eos> - Neither have I!<eos> - You hacked up my husband, dumped his body in a garbage bin.<eos> Because of Wes, okay?<eos> ! We were all trying to help him and you.
- and we've all been trying to clean it up!<eos> - You should've left!<eos> - I tried.<eos> - Well, you bailed on that plan because your boyfriend wouldn't run away with you.<eos> I was trying to protect him from you.
Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> Yeah, I just, uh... I came to a doctor's appointment.<eos> Being back here made me think of you.
Really?<eos> Because I thought that we weren't friends.<eos> Meggy...<eos> Do you know that Michaela and them wouldn't even talk to me at Wes' memorial?<eos> That wasn't about you.
Do you know that Michaela and them wouldn't even talk to me at Wes' memorial?<eos> That wasn't about you.<eos> They were just really worried about how I lost my mind up there on the altar.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I just... I miss him, and I know that you do, too, which is why I shouldn't have shut you out.
I forgive you, Connor.<eos> So, please, Connor, just come home!<eos> Atwood went to New York for a job interview.<eos> And you believe her?<eos> Now I don't know if I believe you.
Atwood went to New York for a job interview.<eos> And you believe her?<eos> Now I don't know if I believe you.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> After everything I've done to you, said to you...
So is killing your professor's husband.<eos> I'll give you some time to think.<eos> I don't know how you expect me to believe anything you say.<eos> Then the both of us are just wasting our time.<eos> That boy, who stood next to Wallace when he was shot then pointed the finger at my son, worked for you.
You have it, or are we going to keep playing games?<eos> Games are a hell of a lot more fun than whatever it is we're doing.<eos> Just give it to me.<eos> Get out.<eos> Lovely seeing you, too.
Did Sylvia play me?<eos> I take that as a yes.<eos> If she cared so much about her grandson, then why was it you who protected him and not her?<eos> And she's hurt people before...<eos> You, the baby.
Okay.<eos> I love you, Michaela.<eos> A lot.<eos> And I know that you probably hate that I'm saying this right now 'cause that's the message that your face is sending me, but...<eos> I couldn't have gotten through any of this without you.
No.<eos> Connor Walsh found the burner phone you used to frame me in your possession.<eos> He'll testify to that in court.<eos> - You think anyone will believe him?<eos> - You want me to come after you
He was burned like a piece of trash, and you deserve to feel the same pain.<eos> But you know what?<eos> I'm gonna let you win.<eos> So take the gift.<eos> Take it, or I'll come for you.
But you know what?<eos> I'm gonna let you win.<eos> So take the gift.<eos> Take it, or I'll come for you.<eos> I'll find every cop you've paid off, every defendant you've framed, and I'll keep coming at you until I have your head on a stick in front of the courthouse.
Give me my deal.<eos> Where is he?<eos> Did it... Did it not work?<eos> My God.<eos> - I was so worried about you.
It should've been me.<eos> I know that, so...<eos> I'll do whatever you want.<eos> Go after the people who did this, find them.<eos> I'm here for you.
We'll follow you.<eos> - No, we won't!<eos> - We're gonna confront him there.<eos> - No, I can't.<eos> - This is for Wes. - No, it's for you, and I'm sorry, but you're not the only one who knows what love is here.
I called earlier about a missing U.S. citizen in the Middle East.<eos> How are you, Sara?<eos> I wanted the State Department, not you.
Ja, are you there?<eos> I'm here.<eos> Whip's right.<eos> The strikes are getting closer.<eos> I pity you.
It's a spoon, string.<eos> - How?<eos> - A string a day from my uniforms for four years.<eos> A spoon a guard overlooked one time in a thousand.<eos> There's a water pipe above you.
This side is original.<eos> They're open, loose.<eos> You want me to free you?<eos> Yes, and I, in turn, free you with those keys, down there.<eos> Why would I trust you more than the madman out there?
Mr. Tic Tac.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> You gonna fight ISIL men?<eos> Get out of here, kid, hide!<eos> - This is no place for you. - You gonna fight ISIL men?
He just pursues his own ideology.<eos> Okay, for instance, listen.<eos> Let's say you think Russia and Iran are having too much influence in the Middle East, and you don't think Washington is getting the job done.<eos> You free Ramal.<eos> Sure, he's an Islamic radical nut job, but he will fight Iran and Russia for you.
- One second.<eos> Please don't do this.<eos> You will lose.<eos> Listen to your friend.<eos> I'm talking to you, Ramal.
We'd definitely take a haircut if we broke it.<eos> But we are allowed to sublet.<eos> Might be our best option.<eos> Furniture's mostly rented month to month... so that's not an issue.<eos> For you, I think you need a desk, some file cabinets.
But, you know, I'm worried.<eos> I can't help it.<eos> She works all the time, and she does not date.<eos> And soon she's gonna be old, and then what's gonna happen to her?<eos> Our goal in this room is to focus on you.
It was this one thing that happened, and I went about my day, pretending all was cool.<eos> What happened to your dad?<eos> Supposedly in prison.<eos> I mean, I haven't seen him in ages, and I don't ever think about him, which I count to be my Christmas gift every year.<eos> But what about you?
- You know, you smell like me.<eos> - What?<eos> Chance, Chanel?<eos> It's just a gift box.<eos> I can't explain it, but... there's something about you that reminds me of me.
Hang that on your wall.<eos> Anyone tells you you're not a good mother, you can tell them to shove it up their arse.<eos> Hey, Natalie, I passed!<eos> Hmm! She's a fully certified parent now.<eos> Good for you.
And what have they said?<eos> Whatever it is, it won't be very nice.<eos> They don't like me and they hate Craig.<eos> What's Craig ever done to your parents, Karen?<eos> He's worked wonders for you.
I'd have been screaming at 'em to let me see her.<eos> Yeah, well, that's you.<eos> Karen's different.<eos> I just think it's a bit premature to be partying.<eos> Yeah, well, bollocks to you, then.
Then it'll all be all right.<eos> We'll have Shannon home back before you know it... And in t'meantime, we've got the, "Tree For Shannon"<eos> to look forward to.<eos> Thanks, Julie.<eos> Dunno what I'd do without you.
Not every day me best mate becomes a grandma...<eos> We are best mates, aren't we?<eos> Natalie's your best mate.<eos> No, you are now.<eos> Can't be easy for you, though.
Oh, shit out your mouth, you!<eos> Yeah, well, he's right, though Julie.<eos> I mean, you carried on helping her when it was plain as t'nose on your face that she were involved. Why?<eos> Cos I thought it were t'right thing to do, that's why.<eos> For what, for her or for you?
What do you mean?<eos> Well, you liked being the centre of attention, didn't you?<eos> The Queen Bee.<eos> You didn't want to let it go.<eos> We trusted you, Julie!
But you hate her.<eos> No... I don't hate her.<eos> I'm angry with her.<eos> And I could never forgive like you have.<eos> But I'll not call you for finding it in you to do it.
So far.<eos> See you, then.<eos> See you.<eos> Oi, pull your tie up!<eos> So, what's next for you, then, Julie?
At first, I said no.<eos> I wouldn't do it.<eos> Then within weeks, Sara was incarcerated, beaten.<eos> And so I gave in.<eos> Everything I did, I did for family, for you, for Sara, for Mike... so none of you would ever have to spend another day inside a prison cell or... or live a life on the run.
- make a-make a deal with them.<eos> - You called them.<eos> Sara?<eos> Sara, please, listen to me.<eos> Sara, this was for you.
Can you just give it to me straight?<eos> You know, I'm a big boy, I can handle it.<eos> There's a reason you're my whip hand.<eos> A reason that's gonna change your life.<eos> There's a light at the end of the tunnel for you.
Not you.<eos> What are you gonna do with that?<eos> Michael, come on.<eos> I'm sorry, Linc.<eos> I should have come to you.
Whip, you stay with him.<eos> Let's move.<eos> He always give you orders like that?<eos> It's complicated.<eos> I got an order for you.
And rule number one in my country is when things get bad, go to the desert.<eos> We are desperate, desperate men.<eos> Not as desperate as Omar right now.<eos> If there's one man you don't want to get on the wrong side of, it's Whip.<eos> That might apply to you, too, Michael.
You don't understand the Phaeacians.<eos> They are beautiful.<eos> Generous.<eos> They just want to smile.<eos> Unlike you.
He's fine.<eos> We all are.<eos> Everyone.<eos> We're going to make it.<eos> It's because of you.
Everyone.<eos> We're going to make it.<eos> It's because of you.<eos> Because of my money.<eos> It's because of you.
Come on.<eos> There is nobility in you, Lincoln.<eos> Hey... when I get back, I'll, I'll buy you a drink.<eos> I don't drink.<eos> But I'll buy you a drink.
Got to hang in there, buddy, huh?<eos> Still got a lot of things to tell me, you know?<eos> You gonna tell me why I'm your whip hand.<eos> Remember?<eos> I got a lot invested in you.
Never thought I'd see this face again.<eos> You weren't supposed to.<eos> Why?<eos> I'll tell you everything you want to know.<eos> But first, i need something from you.
I have a contact at the NSA and she gave me proof.<eos> You're not calling him junior, are you?<eos> I promised you i would never do that.<eos> He's an amazing kid.<eos> He's just like you.
He's a CIA operative, deep cover.<eos> He runs a splinter cell called 21-void.<eos> What does this have to do with you?<eos> He targeted me for my skills, blackmailed me.<eos> He told me if I didn't agree to come work for him, he'd go after you and Linc, put you both in jail.
My god.<eos> You've been through hell, my friend.<eos> Have some faith, papi.<eos> Thanks, papi.<eos> What about you, Linc?
Sure.<eos> I forgave you for the lies.<eos> Your past.<eos> Accepted you.<eos> Loved you and Mike.
I forgave you for the lies.<eos> Your past.<eos> Accepted you.<eos> Loved you and Mike.<eos> How is that not enough for you?
Marseille.<eos> - Marseilles.<eos> - Marseilles.<eos> I own you, Scofield.<eos> I know everything about you.
- Hello, Claudia.<eos> Yeah, the secret to real power is to never betray your intentions, to wear nothing on your sleeve.<eos> And to never let anyone see your face.<eos> Come on in.<eos> Next time I'm sitting in solitary, I'll think of you in here, running the world in air-conditioned comfort.
He's held up well in prison.<eos> He's got a mean streak.<eos> And he grew up without a family.<eos> It means he can be manipulated.<eos> If you're planning something, I'll always be a step ahead of you.
That guy out there is a DEA informant.<eos> We have him in our pocket.<eos> He owes us.<eos> He's got three vans full of agents that are waiting for his call.<eos> They're gonna rain down on you and your pills.
Tricking Abruzzi's kid is one thing.<eos> Poseidon... he knows your face.<eos> Been tracking you since you went to Yemen.<eos> You've been a warrior, and I owe you.<eos> But your face is a liability now to you and your family.
Walk away, please.<eos> Okay, act the tiniest bit flustered.<eos> Now repeat these words back to me loud enough to be heard:<eos> "They didn't show.<eos> I'm coming back to you now."
Now repeat these words back to me loud enough to be heard:<eos> "They didn't show.<eos> I'm coming back to you now."<eos> They didn't show.<eos> I'm coming back to you now.
Scofield was looking for a partner, combing prisons, looking for someone who could handle himself.<eos> And with your innate ability to thrive, rising to the top in even the worst of cages, you reminded him of a certain someone.<eos> And so he did a little research.<eos> Wanted to know what we all want to know.<eos> Did you learn it... or was it ingrained in you?

Burrows!<eos> Hi, Mike.<eos> You know who I am?<eos> I got your map.<eos> I'm gonna get you and your mother out of here.
I need this race.<eos> I need to win.<eos> For what?<eos> Prize money?<eos> That's really worth it to you?
Are you fucking kidding me?<eos> I hate cops.<eos> Put that burger d...<eos> It's just a burger.<eos> I didn't do it for you, Barbie.
Hey, fellas?<eos> You may want to hit the road.<eos> This place is gonna be swarming with cannibals in a few minutes.<eos> Did you mess with my car?<eos> Yeah. I wanted to strand both of us here until we see ourselves on the menu. What do you think?
Thank you for taking our survey.<eos> Welcome to Heart.<eos> Since you decided to stay, you are entitled to one free body modification.<eos> Heart can heal that eye of yours.<eos> Let me take care of you.
Let me take care of you.<eos> However, you did attempt to contact your former partner, did you not?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> That was just...<eos> Which means, before I can trust you, we need to perform some slight behavioral modification.
Miles.<eos> Yeah, well...<eos> Jane.<eos> Clara, don't.<eos> I'm proud of you.
Trouble with Jimmy?<eos> No.<eos> HHM.<eos> I think I'm bound by confidentiality, maybe?<eos> I'm a little hazy on the legal points... but if I tell you what I heard and not Jimmy directly... like.... like we have a buffer...
Doesn't matter who he tells.<eos> - Because it's my word against his.<eos> - Jimmy, there's a tape.<eos> What?<eos> There is a tape recording of you talking to Chuck.
You have your hands full right now.<eos> It is quiet.<eos> I know.<eos> I just want to...<eos> I want so much for you, Bails.
It does not sound good. Do you need medicine?<eos> No, I really want to ride. Especially given yesterday.<eos> Maybe we should take a break today.<eos> You can take a day off.<eos> I worry about you.
I worry about you.<eos> You hit on tight.<eos> I can not.<eos> Do not worry, I'm fine.<eos> I know how important this competition is for you, but you're prepared.
Yes, it's new.<eos> It is new for all of us.<eos> But she is a child, and she will cope.<eos> She adapts and I do not want to brag, but she has us.<eos> She has you, so she will be fine.
Are you ready to face any new dogs?<eos> Now we go and shop.<eos> See if you click with someone.<eos> The first rule is to spend time with blind, you have to verbalize.<eos> Charlie is not blind, you are, and I did not answer you.
Would you introduce yourself?<eos> We can test.<eos> My name is Bailey.<eos> It's nice to meet you.<eos> I will not let you go from here with someone who does not suit you.
For that is how it will be.<eos> It is extremely challenging, but it happens.<eos> You have to accept it and move on.<eos> But the positive is that I'm here.<eos> I am here for you and I will make sure that you get the followers you need.
-Let's go.<eos> -Okay.<eos> I have never heard anyone say so.<eos> Where are we going?<eos> I have worked on a project for you.
She is so small.<eos> A little rough, but that we will fix.<eos> Have you taught her leadership commands?<eos> Yes, she's smart.<eos> She will be a good companion to you.
- I then say it.<eos> - -Type.<eos> You know, she must really like you usually she's pissed.<eos> I think she likes me.<eos> I have a gift for you.
Then we'll go.<eos> -How did it go today?<eos> -Good.<eos> Good to hear.<eos> Honey, I do not know about me and your mom says it enough but we are very proud of you.
I do not know. What do you say about the bush, Apple?<eos> -It sounds good.<eos> -Okay.<eos> Porridge.<eos> To you and the horse.
Oh my God.<eos> Do you have cancer?<eos> Everyone says it's cancer, but I ...<eos> No, no, I do not have cancer.<eos> I looked at Sooner or later I explode and I thought of you.
Yeah.<eos> I am.<eos> You said that you needed to do something and I didn't listen.<eos> I made you put me down.<eos> That couldn't have been easy for you.
She needs comm access.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> But, look...<eos> I understand why you don't trust me.<eos> Let me trust you.
Tell him you need assurance of my safety.<eos> I take the Martian and you let us walk out.<eos> Look, we both know how this goes.<eos> Important, powerful people start fighting each other, it's people like us that die.<eos> I've got nothing against you.
Important, powerful people start fighting each other, it's people like us that die.<eos> I've got nothing against you.<eos> You've got nothing against me.<eos> I need to keep control of the undersecretary.<eos> Not you.
I don't owe you anything.<eos> - My son...<eos> - Yes, your son.<eos> I failed at my job, and Charanpal died.<eos> I owe him. Not you.
If I have any value as a prisoner, I may use it to save your life.<eos> Gambling they haven't decided to take you out?<eos> That's a bad bet.<eos> I won't let you make it.<eos> I don't answer to you.
Good.<eos> You know, I'd really like it if you'd come stay with me for awhile.<eos> I know, Dad.<eos> I'm just busy right now.<eos> We've got a... one medium-rare burger there for you.
Lizzie wanted to say the prayer.<eos> Mikey, come on.<eos> You're a caveman.<eos> And no one wants you here.<eos> Ask Lizzie if she wants you here.
You were supposed to come through on something for me right around the time you quit.<eos> I figured we're even.<eos> Oh, you think we're even, you and I?<eos> What'd you ever do for me?<eos> I did everything for you.
He's good.<eos> How come you guys aren't still close?<eos> What do you mean close?<eos> We're brothers.<eos> Well, that's funny because you were practically like a father to that kid, and he hasn't ever done shit for you.
How come you guys aren't still close?<eos> What do you mean close?<eos> We're brothers.<eos> Well, that's funny because you were practically like a father to that kid, and he hasn't ever done shit for you.<eos> Well, it doesn't look like he's done shit for you, which brings me to my point.
- Nobody.<eos> - Doesn't matter.<eos> What, it doesn't matter?<eos> Is that how it's going to be?<eos> After everything I've done for you?
You wanna know why?<eos> Because tomorrow when we do the exchange, you get to find out how much your brother really loves you.<eos> - Fuck you, Eddie.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I could probably learn something from you and JP.
"When we were teens.<eos> "Cops were on us one day, we ran.<eos> "You got away, but I got caught.<eos> I was 17!<eos> "They offered me community service, "and all I had to do was give up my accomplice, you, my brother.
I hate you.<eos> I hate both of you.<eos> You're so lucky 'cause you had each other!<eos> Well, that's the King brothers.<eos> That's why I can expect something different from you.
Well, that's the King brothers.<eos> That's why I can expect something different from you.<eos> Jesus, man, I did that to you?<eos> No, I did it.<eos> For you.
- And you're gonna get life.<eos> You can't do shit.<eos> What does he want?<eos> How the fuck should I know?<eos> Just like you can't touch him, he can't touch you.
Yeah.<eos> I do.<eos> What the fuck do you want?<eos> Well, your brother owes me his life.<eos> I made him, he made you.
If you gave him that money, they were gonna kill the both of us.<eos> He will hunt us down if we run.<eos> You know that.<eos> Look, I tried to protect you from all of this.<eos> It's my turn to protect you, big bro.
Why don't you quit giving the kid a hard time.<eos> Alexis, where's your dad?<eos> Yeah, where is that chump?<eos> That's the year I was born.<eos> I never told ya how proud I am of you.
Oh, have I jumped out of stage there?<eos> Yeah, I watched half that Edward Snowden documentary. - And now I'm very careful.<eos> - Seriously?<eos> - No, it's just easier if I type it in.<eos> Hey, I liked waking up next to you this morning.
So, um... what are you doin' now?<eos> You wanna keep hangin' out?<eos> You sick of me?<eos> Or...<eos> - I'm not getting sick of you.
You wanna keep hangin' out?<eos> You sick of me?<eos> Or...<eos> - I'm not getting sick of you.<eos> - Well, I'm not sick of you.
- Gus, this is Dustin.<eos> - And that is his dog Buster.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Ah, look at that cutie.<eos> He takes after you.
I'm sorry. I just...<eos> I meant that...<eos> I'm not gonna disappear on you, Gus.<eos> Text me whenever.<eos> I always wanna hear from you.
We don't have much time.<eos> - I can't.<eos> - What?<eos> Look, we got to get you out of here.<eos> No, I'm not leaving without you.
- I deserved to know who I really am.<eos> - I know.<eos> And I promise from now on, no more lies.<eos> Okay.<eos> I have something for you.
- I can't help you with this.<eos> - Why not?<eos> The last time you used a rune to track Jace, it almost killed you.<eos> Why can't you just do this one thing? !<eos> After everything I've done for you.!
They took me in, they trained me.<eos> If anyone's my parents, they are.<eos> I had no choice, Jonathan.<eos> My enemies were closing in.<eos> I sent you to a place where I knew you would be cared for.
Besides, at my house, there's steak and vodka.<eos> I'd rather be there.<eos> Wait, you're just... You're not gonna help?<eos> You really don't get it, do you?<eos> You didn't risk anything for me, you did it for you.
Now, Valentine, Jace, and the Cup are missing.<eos> Do the math.<eos> There is no way we're going to help you hunt Jace.<eos> And I'd never ask you to.<eos> You and your friends are prohibited from any further involvement for the hunt for Jace Wayland.
Life is full of hard choices.<eos> Don't kid yourself.<eos> You're not making a hard choice.<eos> You're saving your own ass.<eos> And unlike you, I don't push someone away just 'cause they're a hard choice.
I'm not going back...<eos> I know.<eos> I just said that so he would let me out.<eos> I want to help you.<eos> I'm here for you.
Who's asking?<eos> Jace is back.<eos> Call off your men.<eos> Izzy and I will bring him back alive.<eos> One step ahead of you.
A girl's gotta eat.<eos> - Your mom's close.<eos> - Then run faster!<eos> I'm a vampire.<eos> I'm running slow for you.
I can smell it.<eos> And you'll do whatever the Clave tells you to do.<eos> - Now, get off of me.!<eos> - Jonathan.<eos> Are you going to let her mock you after what she did?
And you'll do whatever the Clave tells you to do.<eos> - Now, get off of me.!<eos> - Jonathan.<eos> Are you going to let her mock you after what she did?<eos> This thing in front of you...
Mom and Dad?<eos> All the time.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Mom doesn't like you having a warlock boyfriend.<eos> And you?
I'm good.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, I guess congratulations are in order.<eos> I guess so.<eos> I'm happy for you.
I heard you like to drink.<eos> Welcome, Maryse.<eos> Max, this is your night.<eos> You do have exotic taste, don't you?<eos> Oh, the Spanish theme is in honor of you and your husband.
Max...<eos> You were just as curious at his age.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I only share with my closest friends.<eos> How much of you is a demon?
Jace, I...<eos> This is your fault.<eos> I've tried to keep Max out of it.<eos> The hell you have.<eos> He learned this behavior from you.
Alec?<eos> It's okay.<eos> I sedated him when I pulled him from the ledge.<eos> You know what, you stay away from him.<eos> You can't be trusted.
How did you two save the angel?<eos> With runes the angel gave to me.<eos> New runes, Magnus.<eos> Ones no one's ever seen before.<eos> Why did he choose you?
We can't replace them.<eos> But if we don't move forward because of them...<eos> It's getting pretty heated out there.<eos> They just need to blow off some steam.<eos> They're losing faith in you, Luke.
Jace, are you OK?<eos> Yeah, why wouldn't I be?<eos> Well, you've barely spoken about what happened with the Soul Sword.<eos> Yeah, well, there's not much to talk about.<eos> OK, but if you do feel like talking, I'm here for you. I'm your sister, Jace.
And that means being completely honest, even if the truth hurts.<eos> I get it.<eos> Emotions serve a purpose.<eos> You don't go through what you just went through, witnessing all that death and not feel something, Jace!<eos> It's not good for you!
She... pho-got?<eos> Oh my God.<eos> A joke.<eos> So you are human after all.<eos> Well, what about you?
Ahh! Magnus!<eos> Stop him!<eos> Stop him.<eos> Stupid warlock.<eos> Now a present for you, my dear Valentine.
I'm getting better but I can't come home.<eos> Not now.<eos> If... it was something I said, I just want you to know, just...<eos> No.<eos> No, it's not you.
How long will it take to effect repairs?<eos> 15 years.<eos> Well, that won't do.<eos> What is that, Captain?<eos> There are some things, Gideon, I can't even tell you.
Why do you think he'd say that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe he's...<eos> Captain, hello.<eos> How... What can we do for you?
They have Rip.<eos> We lost him, Jax.<eos> Again.<eos> But they won't have him for long.<eos> If I know one thing about you, it's that you don't give up.
Here's another...<eos> Do you believe in second chances?<eos> I just watched you die.<eos> Yeah, I hear 2016's not my best year, but I plan on fixing that.<eos> But the question for you, Malcolm, is:
One that we can use to gain access to our objective.<eos> To not use him is foolish. Oh.<eos> Well, in that case, I would have to defer to your superior expertise in foolishness.<eos> But if your plan goes south, it's not our speedster friend you need to worry about.<eos> One thing I hate more than taking orders from him... is being threatened by you.
Okay, we will figure this out.<eos> And in the meantime, you and Lily keep working with the amulet to figure out to figure out where the rest of the Spear is.<eos> Who's to say he won't kill us anyway?<eos> Even after we've gotten his precious spear?<eos> Oh, forget it. Why am I asking you? I don't know, man.
Okay, you two have made your point.<eos> I need you as much as you need me, all right.<eos> But if you do not open that door, he is going to kill us.<eos> He is coming for me!<eos> Who's coming for you? It's not a who.
How about I sit on my ass and let you obliterate permanently from existence?<eos> How's that sound?<eos> That's your plan?<eos> Do it or you'll Reverse-Flash me?<eos> Not you.
Make me what I need.<eos> And I will let you both go.<eos> I hated Thawne... and Zoom.<eos> They took so much from me.<eos> And I've hated Savitar for threatening to take you away from me too.
- Really?<eos> - You don't have much time... before the paradox reaches you.<eos> Come back to S.T.A.R Labs.<eos> Let Cisco and Caitlin go, and let us figure out a way to save you.<eos> You really think I'd trust you?
Maybe I get off on watching you grovel.<eos> No, I don't think that's it.<eos> I think you're hearing me.<eos> I'm still in there.<eos> Deep down, buried beneath the scars and the pain, that part of you that... it must feel so lonely.
No, he won't.<eos> A bad guy like Savitar always turns on his partners.<eos> Not this time.<eos> Wake up!<eos> You're only saying that because he needs something from you.
I'll never let the pain, the darkness, determine who I am.<eos> I will never be you.<eos> All these months, you were trying to save me from him.<eos> Look at that.<eos> I saved you.
He wasn't a genius, and he didn't have super speed.<eos> But when we needed him the most, he was our hero.<eos> He was my hero.<eos> Mine too.<eos> Good on you, mate.
Right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Mate...<eos> Do you mind sticking around?<eos> - Anything for you.
My beautiful boy.<eos> It's time to rest.<eos> - Don't mess it up with her.<eos> - I'll do my best.<eos> They're all gonna look to you now.
- I'll do my best.<eos> They're all gonna look to you now.<eos> I'm not a hero like you.<eos> You've always been my hero.<eos> All this time we were trying to save Iris, you're telling me that... we should've been trying to save you too?
I'll still be here when the conference is over, and the way Oliver describes it, you're the one that's doing all at the mayor's office.<eos> I guess spontaneous resurrection is as good as any reason for a party.<eos> -But... -But we haven't even buried detective Malone yet.<eos> It feels weird to be celebrating?<eos> It doesn't feel weird to you?
After the past 4 years, it's just hard for me to accept good news.<eos> Rene: Hss. Weird, man.<eos> She was dead.<eos> Now she's not.<eos> Well, that's time travel for you.
Because he's innocent.<eos> The man who framed him is a 3-star general.<eos> John did not think that he would get a fair trial in the court system, which is where you come in.<eos> Oliver, I'm a city prosecutor, not a military defense attorney.<eos> That's why I thought of you.
So mom and dad are going 12 rounds<eos> They're just having a discussion.<eos> I--i know that i took the teasing too far earlier.<eos> I can be an acquired taste, but... I'm sorry to hear about Paul and that I made you feel worse about it.<eos> Thanks. That's really big of you.
I am so sorry, but I think it's about time that<eos> Felicity or me!<eos> Laurel!<eos> Don't do this.<eos> There's no coming back for you.
You a fan of progress?<eos> Why don't you just put a bullet in my head and be done with it?<eos> Or maybe you don't have the sack to pull the trigger.<eos> I was gonna play another hand, let you rest some, but lay down a challenge like that, what's a guy gonna do?<eos> I'm gonna get what I need from you or maybe one of those molars back there.
Fine.<eos> You got me.<eos> This is just some woman who teaches preschool in the glades, but my point still stands.<eos> That point being?<eos> That no matter how amazing they are no one's gonna be good enough for you.
Stop.<eos> Costume warehouse having a fire sale I didn't know about?<eos> What do you want?<eos> You're a vigilante and a meta-human, and for the past 3 years, you've been working alone.<eos> We have a proposition for you.
Your vendetta doesn't end with him.<eos> Nope.<eos> I'm still looking for his boss.<eos> His friends are the ones currently shooting it out with your friends.<eos> Well, we can help you get him without anyone else dying in the process, including and especially you.
What the hell was that?<eos> Sonus... he's a meta-human, too.<eos> - How is she?<eos> - Still unconscious.<eos> I don't know about you, man, but my head is still spinning a bit.
Figured I'd what?<eos> It's none of my business.<eos> Ok.<eos> Well, um... heh.<eos> I became a hacker, a hacktivist, because of you, the gfg.
The NSA's information gathering program? We hoovered up 8 petabytes of data including everything you need to help your friend.<eos> We're calling the data cache pandora.<eos> With it, you can take down politicians, bankrupt companies, spark revolutions.<eos> So you're not just giving me the file for John.<eos> You inspired me to make the world a better place, and now I intend to inspire you to be the hacktivist you used to be, the great ghost fox Goddess.

Let me guess.<eos> You're trusting me with your mask off, so now I'm supposed to trust you.<eos> I just thought that if you weren't gonna listen to the Green Arrow that you might listen to Oliver Queen.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> I spent 5 years in hell, not unlike what happened to you when you were undercover in Sonus' organization or what he put you through when he discovered you were a cop.
What do you care?<eos> You don't even know me.<eos> I thought I'd proven otherwise.<eos> General Shreve, Baron Reiter, Konstantin Kovar.<eos> You keep looking for new fights when the real fight has been in front of you all along.
And I can help you find your way back.<eos> You think yourself a monster.<eos> No.<eos> I am a monster.<eos> There is a monster inside you, yes, but it is not you.
Tina Boland was my official cover for undercover work.<eos> It was to protect my family.<eos> My real name is Dinah, Dinah Drake.<eos> Dinah?<eos> Does that name mean something to you?
- I'll check the RPG site.<eos> - I'll accompany you.<eos> Oh, it's almost like you don't trust me, Nyssa.<eos> No.<eos> It's exactly like I don't trust you.
It's exactly like I don't trust you.<eos> Check it out.<eos> Stay on comms.<eos> Why does he get a weapon and I don't?<eos> I trust him more than you.
Or your son loses his mother.<eos> Oh, and don't worry about that gun, mate.<eos> Mr. Chase gave me this nice new one...<eos> Along with a better offer.<eos> Adrian said it would be pointless to reach out to you.
Malcolm, can you fly a plane?<eos> If it's anything like the 3 Gulfstreams I used to have, yes.<eos> Get them to the mainland and then come right back for us.<eos> We are not leaving you here.<eos> I need to focus, and that means getting you out of harm's way, and despite my better instincts, when this is all over, I will come back for you.
Well, it's not really that complicated.<eos> You suffer from survivor's guilt.<eos> You can't get over the death of your father.<eos> Adrian Chase has nothing to do with my father.<eos> Kid, when it comes to you, everything has to do with your father.
Oliver.<eos> Don't blame me.<eos> Mr. Wilson's the one who gets credit for this trophy.<eos> Slade, you son of a bitch.<eos> I never should have trusted you.
And you left me, knowing I would suffer at father's hand.<eos> Do you wish to settle the score now?<eos> I stand with my friends.<eos> You ally yourself with our father's murderer?<eos> He'd be ashamed of you.
Well, I hope that never happens.<eos> It won't.<eos> I wouldn't jeopardize this.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> I can't even imagine my life without you and Dolly.
I can't even imagine my life without you and Dolly.<eos> How far do you think you'd go?<eos> How do you mean?<eos> Emotionally, would you... would you fight for me?<eos> Of course I would fight for you.
- Exactly.<eos> See, by resisting it, you're actually giving it more power.<eos> The sick thing is that after that dream, I got off, and when I finished, I thought of Sidney with everyone but me.<eos> These douchey guys just fucking her all at the same time. It's like some weird form of punishment.<eos> You can't allow Sidney to have that kind of power over you.
That's not who I am.<eos> You don't want to go through life alone.<eos> Look, I'm sure Michael would understand.<eos> You know what?<eos> I'm... I'm not taking relationship advice from you.
Two months ago?<eos> It was around my birthday.<eos> She stopped by to drop off a present, and we spoke for, like, a minute.<eos> And why are you so afraid to talk to her, Allison?<eos> Do you know that look? The one where the person you love most is completely disappointed in you?
Now just go be with your friends.<eos> Go on, enjoy the party.<eos> You're not mad at me anymore?<eos> Oh, honey, no, I'm not mad at you, 'cause you're my girl, right?<eos> And I'd do anything for you.
No, Daddy.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Nice to meet you, Dolly.<eos> Yes, yes, go, go.<eos> ‚ô™ Happy birthday to you ‚ô™
- Thank you.<eos> - Nice to meet you, Dolly.<eos> Yes, yes, go, go.<eos> ‚ô™ Happy birthday to you ‚ô™<eos> ‚ô™ Happy birthday to you ‚ô™
Yes, yes, go, go.<eos> ‚ô™ Happy birthday to you ‚ô™<eos> ‚ô™ Happy birthday to you ‚ô™<eos> ‚ô™ Happy birthday, dear Dolly ‚ô™<eos> ‚ô™ Happy birthday to you ‚ô™
- Okay, I give up.<eos> I wished for the magician to make you happy.<eos> Oh, honey, listen to me.<eos> I am happy, and I don't need a magician for that.<eos> I have you and Daddy. And that's more than enough.
I am happy, and I don't need a magician for that.<eos> I have you and Daddy. And that's more than enough.<eos> Now let's go to sleep.<eos> - I love you.<eos> - I love you, too, Mommy.
A big movie.<eos> Proud of ya.<eos> And, uh, Mom, I'm guessing you want me to do the indie one?<eos> I do.<eos> I think Lowlands is a better move for you.
- Back to the hustle, huh?<eos> - Dude, I gotta.<eos> How else am I gonna leave a good impression?<eos> - I know.<eos> I know. - What about you?
- Lowlands.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Liberty Down.<eos> - Ah. All right.<eos> So Arya trusts you.
- Whoa. Come on, dude.<eos> - Oh, dude.<eos> Come on. - We'll go when I'm ready.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - I hate this store and I hate you.
Hey, I care what you feel, okay?<eos> Don't say that.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> You just want me to work so you have a job.<eos> Hey, I could get a job without you, okay?
- Really? That's what you think?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, there was definitely a tone change.<eos> - That's very perceptive, Gus. - Mmm-hmm.<eos> And that's one of the things I like about you.
Or maybe I'm somebody who has got your fucking number.<eos> And I'll... tell you what I did tonight.<eos> I saved two people.<eos> I saved that poor man-child from being another fucking victim of yours!<eos> And I saved you from getting even farther away from what you really fucking feel!
- Ah... - No!<eos> Hey, well, that's great!<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Great.<eos> Good for you, Micks.
I figured I'd get up there early, get a good night's sleep before the big meeting.<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> I mean, don't you want to just come see where I live?<eos> It's the first nice place I've ever lived in.<eos> Oh, sweetheart, I came to see you, not your place.
You, um... You tempted or...<eos> No.<eos> I don't...<eos> I don't know!<eos> Well, here's to you, Jersey girl!
Hold on.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Just...<eos> Do you really fucking need people to like you that badly?<eos> I'm the one who should matter to you. Not him.
It's him.<eos> He was shitty to you.<eos> It's okay to be upset.<eos> I'll give you a ride home so you can get a break from me.<eos> I don't want a break from you.
Totally, totally, totally.<eos> I get it. Yeah.<eos> I wasn't trying to shame you or whatever, you know.<eos> I know you're rockin' it.<eos> I'm super proud of you.
And I know if I ever messed up, he would be so disappointed in me.<eos> It's too much pressure.<eos> I wouldn't worry about it.<eos> I think you're just feeling this way because you guys have been cooped up in this house together.<eos> If he goes, "I'm proud of you," one more time, I'm gonna slit his fucking throat.
- Len.<eos> - Truman.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> So what about you?
That way we don't have to think about it.<eos> Yeah, I guess I could call you, probably...<eos> - Let's say 9:00 for me.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Which would be, like, 6:00 for you. That work?
I actually went and bought her cookbooks.<eos> I eat quinoa now.<eos> If we could pull someone like that in, I think the Subzero guys would really, really love that.<eos> Stella, hi!<eos> We were just talking about you.
- Cleaned up the bathroom.<eos> Threw out eye shadow from the '90s.<eos> Shit is getting done!<eos> Good.<eos> Good. Good for you.
I'm fine.<eos> Thanks for checking in, Dr. Gus.<eos> - I'm just... concerned.<eos> - Don't be concerned, dude!<eos> I'm not concerned about you.
Oh, they're clean.<eos> - Very wet. - He, uh... he loves surprises.<eos> - I hate surprises.<eos> - Since he was a kid.<eos> Oh, Bertie, it is so cool to finally meet you, 'cause this guy won't stop talking about you and my mom's already told all her friends about you.
You've been spending a lot of time with her.<eos> Her? Who?<eos> Anita?<eos> That's what you call her? Anita?<eos> Deputy DA Benitez to you.
You know how I always introduce Renee as the future ex-Mrs. Johnson?<eos> I thought that was funny, you know, given my matrimonial history, and...<eos> Barrel, I am so sorry.<eos> What're ya gonna do?<eos> No retirement for you, pal.
Do me a favor, take their call. Yeah, yeah.<eos> No, I mean it.<eos> Lewis is on the war path.<eos> I said yeah.<eos> I'm worried about you, Harry.
I'm not in your position.<eos> What if this were yours, how would you feel?<eos> Um, I think, I would... support your right to make your own decision.<eos> And how would you feel?<eos> I would feel bad, for you, for doing this.
It's an accreditation year.<eos> I get it.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> I mean, this was a huge win for you
Hey, what are you doing here?<eos> Well, Stef was with Jesus, so I thought I would come by and talk with some of his teachers.<eos> Oh, you haven't met Drew.<eos> Drew Turner, this is Lena Adams Foster.<eos> I've heard so much about you.
I wouldn't mind.<eos> Mike's been good to me, but...<eos> I don't know how Ty would feel about it.<eos> You know, him being a white cop and all.<eos> I thought Ty was glad that you had Mike looking after you.
I do.<eos> I wasn't handling it.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - I was so scared that I was frozen.<eos> Maybe at first, but you know what, you were the one that talked him out of hurting you and himself.
- No, no, no.<eos> This is not your fault.<eos> It's my fault.<eos> I never should've asked you to take your project down to begin with.<eos> I should've fought for you and I'm actually really proud that your classmates are.
He didn't become a liar overnight.<eos> I'll take care of the rest of this.<eos> You go get some sleep, all right?<eos> - I love you.<eos> - I love you.
We're not hooking up or anything, but there's this... secret, and...<eos> I just can't face him and not tell him the truth, so I've been avoiding him.<eos> So, I...<eos> I wrote him this.<eos> It doesn't say anything about you.
This guy's looking for Vanessa, says he worked here with her.<eos> - Oh, yeah?<eos> When was that?<eos> - Uh... A few years ago.<eos> I've been here for five years, I don't remember you.
- Okay.<eos> Thanks.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - All right.<eos> Thank you. - Cool, thanks, Chris.
I hope we're sitting together.<eos> Okay, so I found Grandma.<eos> And you need to come upstairs, like now.<eos> So are you mad at me?<eos> Not everything's about you, Callie.
What do you mean?<eos> Because she has a record that won't let her move in if he's fostering' me.<eos> First of all, I don't think that's the only reason.<eos> Why didn't you tell me?<eos> 'Cause all we do is talk about you, Callie.
And I don't have a rich daddy to buy me the best lawyers.<eos> If I make trouble and get arrested, I'm goin' down.<eos> Just like Ty.<eos> That's it.<eos> I'd do anything for you, but I'm not gonna follow you down a rabbit hole.
I think if you have any vows, you might wanna spit 'em out now.<eos> - Uh... - Okay, I...<eos> I didn't really prepare anything, but, um... of course I would marry you again today.<eos> I am marrying you today.<eos> No matter how hard life gets, or what challenges we face... my love for you has only gotten stronger over this past year.
Some kids showed up afraid of the consequences of outting themselves to their parents if they asked them to sign a permission slip.<eos> And I understand where Lena was coming from.<eos> All these students wanted was to attend a basic sex education class, not much different from the one we offer to all our other students.<eos> Yes, but I... I accept full responsibility.<eos> Well, this doesn't really fall on you, Lena.
I mean, Drew totally threw Monte under the bus.<eos> I'm sure it's only a matter of time before he stabs me in the back.<eos> I don't know about that, Lena.<eos> He got the job that he wanted.<eos> He can't run the school without you; he needs you.
- Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. - Oh!<eos> Text me their number!<eos> What?<eos> You okay?<eos> Is... this safe for you?
You seriously think that's okay?<eos> I was defending you.<eos> - I can defend myself.<eos> - But you didn't.<eos> You just sat there and let your family say really awful things about you.
- But you didn't.<eos> You just sat there and let your family say really awful things about you.<eos> Look, I don't like the way they treat me either, but I made a choice.<eos> I could... push them away, or I could accept them.<eos> Yeah, but they don't accept you!
I'm tired, I want to sleep.<eos> Um, I think I'm gonna bail.<eos> Okay.<eos> I thought we were gonna hang out.<eos> Yeah, I just don't really feel like being around you right now.
Right, and the donuts?<eos> In the kitchen.<eos> - Hey, I want that last fritter.<eos> - Oh, okay.<eos> I, um, actually printed something out for you while I was out.
But it's something.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Yeah, so...<eos> No plea deal?<eos> Well, if you can put up with all the things your family says about you, I think I can handle what some strangers at a trial say about me, so...
- The garage?<eos> - Gabe's moving in.<eos> - Nothing has been decided yet.<eos> - What about me?<eos> - What about you?
- I love you, too, a'ight?<eos> You gotta bring one of those girls, baby.<eos> - What happened with your lawyers?<eos> - My birth dad's gonna pay off the victims.<eos> Good for you.
Okay, let us just... think about this... for a while, okay?<eos> And in the meantime, please just keep it to yourself.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey, love, um... thank you very much for taking Emma and being there for her.<eos> - That was good of you.
- So, this is Isabella? - Mm-hmm.<eos> - You've never met her? - No.<eos> Uh-uh.<eos> Isabella, this is Gabe.<eos> she looks like you.
For, like, a whole day or more?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, actually, I... I had a... I had a dream about it when I was in my coma.<eos> We were in our crib and you were crying, and I was...<eos> I was trying to take care of you.
Now I got the power, and I got somebody that loves me, protects me.<eos> Nobody ever done nothin' like that for me before.<eos> So he could like...<eos> get me a record deal?<eos> You take care of him, and he'll take care of you.
Oh... you might wanna take in those cans.<eos> You don't wanna get a fine.<eos> Have a nice day, ladies.<eos> I got 'em.<eos> I folded your laundry for you.
There was also $200 cash in his pocket.<eos> They couldn't use it in court, but it establishes motive and places him at Martha's on that day.<eos> Well, are you sure it's not a lie, it wasn't planted?<eos> Yes, love.<eos> I am sorry, I know... this is really disappointing for you.
Uh, I'm gonna run an errand, so I'll be back in about an hour.<eos> Hey, Brandon.<eos> - Do you want me to...<eos> - No, it's... it's fine.<eos> I should've known I couldn't trust you.
- What, my brain's not right?<eos> What about your brain?<eos> Y... you're so depressed that y... you got evicted.<eos> M... m... maybe you should take your meds.<eos> I wanna be here for you, Jesus.
Don't say that.<eos> Okay?<eos> You're gonna get better.<eos> - And... and sex isn't... everything.<eos> - That's easy for you to say.
with a rich daddy.<eos> You ain't goin' to prison.<eos> You're gonna go to college.<eos> You're gonna get married, you're gonna have babies.<eos> You have your whole life ahead of you.
- That's okay.<eos> I don't care about that.<eos> I mean, I do, but it's not all that I care about.<eos> Well, you know, we can still do stuff.<eos> You know, for you?
Hey, I have to go, but you...<eos> listen to me... Lena.<eos> You can get on board, be a part of this, benefit from it, or you can step aside.<eos> The vote's tomorrow, so this is happening.<eos> With or without you.
I was wrong about Kyle.<eos> Pretty sure he killed that poor woman.<eos> I can't believe I... let myself get so wrapped up in all of this.<eos> It was so stupid.<eos> So... what does that mean for you?
No, I just mean, um... Like don't do... all kinds of stupid things.<eos> Just use that, uh, hurt, and anger, and...<eos> Use it for things like fighting for the school, which you're doing, so...<eos> Where do you think I learned that?<eos> From you.
What do you think you're doing?<eos> Cause it looks like you're running away, and I know y'all are not that dumb!<eos> Guys, don't do this.<eos> I thought you were trying to clean up.<eos> You know my mom took a really big chance getting you into GU.
He's... he's coming to come get us.<eos> I can't.<eos> - You don't have to, you don't have to.<eos> - You stay out of this!<eos> It doesn't concern you!
Wait, wait, you...<eos> You took Emma to... to get an... an abortion?<eos> !<eos> Stop, Jesus, stop, okay?<eos> She was scared, she needed a friend, and she couldn't tell you.
You know why I can't be some Bratva thug.<eos> You made promise.<eos> You swore oath, and now one of your brothers is dead, so why should I welcome you as brother?<eos> Go home, Oliver.<eos> There's nothing for you here.
Yeah?<eos> Well, simple or not, Oliver, we have to use every asset we've got.<eos> I made a mistake with Leonov.<eos> It was a challenging time, but you still owe me for Gregor.<eos> Lucky for you, I never liked Leonov.
The people in this data cache, they're not good people.<eos> I'm starting to believe that purpose on this earth is to stop people like them, like Walker, no matter what the cost.<eos> Sometimes, you got to fight fire with fire.<eos> I'm not worried about them.<eos> I'm worried about you.
That's hardly a revelatory observation.<eos> In--in fact, I--I think it's, uh-- it's called living.<eos> Prometheus has you so fixated on what's wrong with you that you've completely stopped seeing what's right.<eos> You know, John and Felicity, they'll listen to you because you have more to offer than just this.<eos> Your past is a part of you.
Reason?<eos> Because I screwed up...<eos> Again.<eos> That's my life, man.<eos> I'm wearing this suit again because I think it's a path to redemption, and it could be for you, too.
Thank you.<eos> Curtis is coming in.<eos> He's gonna help with the search.<eos> It's really nice to have you back.<eos> Well, I could say the same to you.
So there.<eos> - Quentin! Oh!<eos> - Hey. Ha ha!<eos> Oh, so good to see you.<eos> And you, too.
When I get home, either there's no more drugs in this house or there's no more you in this house.<eos> Two of the victims who were in critical condition just passed away on the table.<eos> Who?<eos> Kyle in commerce and Paula in accounting. Ohh. I need phone numbers for the next of kin.<eos> I already emailed them to you.
We don't know much.<eos> It was a single shooter, AR-15 assault rifle.<eos> And it-- it doesn't appear that I was his primary target because he just...<eos> Blasted his way through city hall.<eos> If he wasn't going after you, then there's a larger agenda here.
Hey, hey, hey.<eos> Look, James, you got to think about your wife and your daughters.<eos> I am thinking about them.<eos> I know that you want this pain to go away.<eos> And I know that you want to be with your family again, but if you want them to live on, it has to be through you.
Hey!<eos> Long time, no see.<eos> What are you doing down here?<eos> Oh, just some damage control. You have a minute?<eos> Yeah, for you anything.
And so you did what you had to.<eos> Why shouldn't I do the same for myself?<eos> Because what I did and what you're doing are not the same thing!<eos> Sure they are.<eos> We all do whatever it takes to survive, and if that means breaking a few laws or betraying the people who believe in you, so be it!
You're making a mistake.<eos> Drop the bow, or we will light your ass up.<eos> Fine.<eos> Son of a bitch!<eos> What do you mean they were after you?
I got your text, and I--<eos> Huh.<eos> You look like you're having as bad a day as I am.<eos> Really?<eos> Did you get fired today, too?
We believe he's en route to engage Warner, Cutter, and Chien Na Wei.<eos> We're tracking him, and we'll be there when he does.<eos> Move out.<eos> Thanks for keying me in on this.<eos> I trust you like I'm trusting that certain people can handle the truth.
I'll catch you back downtown.<eos> - Anything?<eos> - Nada.<eos> Peeps on the street are actually more afraid of the vigilante than us.<eos> What about you?
Forget I asked.<eos> I'll bring you guys the visor, ok?<eos> Copy that.<eos> We're here.<eos> Curtis, this is on you now.
I had a... A family emergency.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - Don't be.<eos> Family's important.<eos> Hey, why don't I log that in for you so you can handle your emergency?
This is District Attorney Chase.<eos> Hey, Oliver's out of the hospital, headed to city hall.<eos> Any word from Dinah?<eos> Um, she's at the precinct trying to recover that piece of vigilante's visor.<eos> What about you, Felicity?
Computers?<eos> Empathy... big, reflexive, pure empathy.<eos> Well, maybe I'm fresh out.<eos> Because of Billy.<eos> It's a dark world, and for the past 4 years, I have watched you and Oliver and Laurel and Thea and Roy.
I do appreciate that, but I meant what happens next with us?<eos> Sorry to interrupt, but I think you'll be happy that we did.<eos> Council voted against impeachment.<eos> Thank you so much, Adrian.<eos> I could not have done this without you.
That doesn't mean that you have to quit, Thea.<eos> - I need you here.<eos> - Ollie, please.<eos> Please don't ask me to stay because I will.<eos> I will for you, but I am broken, ok?
You knew?<eos> If you knew, then why would you train him?<eos> Why wouldn't you warn me?<eos> Two years ago, he sought me out.<eos> He'd already learned much about you.
Now you could try torturing me for her location.<eos> We both know what you're capable of in that department, but...<eos> I think that we both know what I'm capable of, so, Ollie, who do you think can last longer...<eos> Susan or me?<eos> Ohh. I'm 10 steps ahead of you, and you haven't even figured out what game we're playing yet.
Right.<eos> Of course, for all you know,<eos> Prometheus could have kkhhk... ooh.<eos> Not...<eos> I'm worried about you.
Viktor has confirmed Gregor's location, but tell me, why did you want him gone and why are you playing Robin Hood?<eos> I met a woman.<eos> She taught me how to give my darkness an identity so that it doesn't consume me.<eos> And you believed her?<eos> Oliver, whatever you think is inside you is inside you.
I met a woman.<eos> She taught me how to give my darkness an identity so that it doesn't consume me.<eos> And you believed her?<eos> Oliver, whatever you think is inside you is inside you.<eos> You... you cannot name it like that and keep it apart from you.
- This building is gonna explode.<eos> - What about...<eos> Chase wants me.<eos> You're no longer his target.<eos> I was gonna say what about you?
Then you'd be dead.<eos> So would you.<eos> Really?<eos> You really think I'd let that happen, Oliver?<eos> Remember, I'm always 10 steps ahead of you.
Yeah, and this time, I have no leads whatsoever.<eos> You guys have better resources than I do, and I have to use everything that I can to find him and do whatever you need me to do for you.<eos> I don't believe I taught you how to escape from shackles, Oliver.<eos> Your father was an honorable man.<eos> You've allied with a psychopath, and he'd be ashamed of you.
I am sorry.<eos> _ _<eos> Tell me who this Prometheus is.<eos> I guess you know what I've been up to, huh?<eos> Remember, I'm always 10 steps ahead of you.
Attempt to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization.<eos> The penalties are the same as if he actually did it.<eos> The boy just wanted to see his father.<eos> We're all going. Do they think we're terrorists, too, huh?<eos> No, but you haven't been online praising suicide bombers.
Lord...<eos> Is it you?<eos> We have found you.<eos> You have, it seems.<eos> Who are you?
_<eos> _<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Preventing the apocalypse.<eos> What are you doing?
I made that mistake once. That's why I have to go to that Army base four weeks a year.<eos> Wait a minute. Why are you still here?<eos> Have you not seen Mikey since you've been back?<eos> I probably have.<eos> You people all look the same to me.
If you are interested in stories with happy endings, then you would be better off somewhere else.<eos> In this story, not only is there no happy ending, there is no happy beginning, and very few happy things in the middle.<eos> My name is Lemony Snicket.<eos> It is my solemn duty to bring to light the sorry history of the Baudelaire children as it happened so many years ago.<eos> But you in the audience have no such obligation, and I would advise all our viewers to turn away immediately and watch something more pleasant instead.
We know what "hasty" means.<eos> Hello there!<eos> Salutations!<eos> Shalom!<eos> You must be the Baudelaire children!
A cookbook, so we can make dinner.<eos> I suppose anything but lamb.<eos> Well, my private library is open to you whenever you'd like.<eos> It's mostly law books, but there are sections on everything from Italian cuisine to the world's most threatening fungus.<eos> I suppose it's not as nice as the libraries you're used to, but...
Why would Jonas pick this place?<eos> I'll keep an eye on you from across the bridge.<eos> Oh, my fucking God.<eos> Yes, my new surroundings are less than salubrious.<eos> I couldn't understand why they were bothering to keep me alive... until I realized you were still free.

What job?<eos> I don't have a job.<eos> And I can't get a job because I don't have an agent.<eos> Why don't I have an agent?<eos> Because he could see what you both refuse to see.
Not a mistake. It's not a mistake, Dani.<eos> It's a reality.<eos> They accepted it.<eos> And I have accepted it.<eos> Now you two have to.

You and I? We are getting closer and closer, Will.<eos> Mr. Wrangler will see you now.<eos> Okay.<eos> Mr. Bak wants everything to be perfect.<eos> You are the face of his hospitality.

We deserve it.<eos> We've acted as if it would go on forever.<eos> Even as shitty returns, the outflow of institutional money, and the rise of quant funds have lighted the way to our demise, we have willfully refused to change.<eos> In the great expanse of time, we are already dead.<eos> I know it even if you don't.
Even as shitty returns, the outflow of institutional money, and the rise of quant funds have lighted the way to our demise, we have willfully refused to change.<eos> In the great expanse of time, we are already dead.<eos> I know it even if you don't.<eos> But in this microsecond that we are still breathing air, I'm gonna fight the inevitable.<eos> If you have a card in front of you, pick it up, hold it in front of your face.
If you see me at the coffee machine, you wait until Steph is there before you pitch me the cream.<eos> I am a survivor.<eos> And I will do whatever it takes to avoid my fate.<eos> Ask yourselves...<eos> Are you?
Well, well, well.<eos> Three young apprentices celebrating the departure of a colleague.<eos> Sure. But don't they also want to put a foot in his ass and take his spot?<eos> Hmm? Oh, come on.<eos> You know Head of Crim is the hyperloop that propels you into whatever job you want next.
- Of course.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Before I go and have a nightcap with Bart Schooner and get his thoughts on who should replace him, let me speak to what's hanging over the table and this entire room.<eos> The investigation that Mr. Dake is conducting.<eos> You all know how to handle yourselves.
Whether it's a package or a person that seems out of place, we'd love you to let us know.<eos> Because there's a lot of noise out there these days.<eos> A noisy press that's choosing to dwell on the past instead of what's happening right now.<eos> My husband and I want to protect you.<eos> In two weeks' time, you will be heading to the ballot box to decide what kind of country you want to live in.
So, who else did you invite, honey?<eos> I invited Karen, and the plumber and the electrician.<eos> Who knows?<eos> They may all pop up later.<eos> This is a marvelous house, and at that price, you two made out like bandits. - Mm.
Jesus Christ!<eos> Are you insane?<eos> No, she's angry.<eos> We're all angry.<eos> You done our girl wrong, Mr. Caputo, and you gonna fix it.
Okay, but I wanna hold the keys.<eos> What are you whispering about?<eos> We're talking about who's gonna hold the keys!<eos> It's me.<eos> I will hold the keys, I will open the cage, and I will select a medicine, and you will all stand aside.
Not good for MCC.<eos> Barring the arrest...<eos> I hope you get everything you want.<eos> I've never been able to make a difference here.<eos> Maybe you'll have better luck.
How do you go to the bathroom?<eos> Funnel.<eos> Tube.<eos> And a little suction.<eos> Everything we do on the ISS is like everything you do on earth
Vikram!<eos> Vikram!<eos> Vikram!<eos> Vikram!<eos> Action and emotion is found in every love story but in this love story, there is a twist that you all have never seen before.
Don't consider me weak!<eos> - Ms. Shilu, Ms. Mahatre<eos> Ms. Shidke.. Come on out, everyone.<eos> What is it, Supriya?<eos> Why did you scream? - These boys are bothering us.
- Do you have a witness?<eos> Tell me! - Witness?<eos> Do you take me for a fool?<eos> I understand everything.<eos> You people are very cunning.
- Yes, tell me.<eos> Are you in Pune?<eos> - Yes. Where else would I be?<eos> Your handkerchief was found on Wasim's body.<eos> Are you all crazy!
You alright?<eos> We have to bring you to Reynard.<eos> He'll know what to do.<eos> Reynard and his team just tried to put us in a coma!<eos> Because you attacked us!
The one, the only, Frankenstein!<eos> They really love you.<eos> You could've died a champion, but now you'll have to taste defeat at the hands of perfection.<eos> You'll pay for that, boy.<eos> Citizens, you know who I am,
So much for GPS.<eos> Don't tell me you were cheering for Abe.<eos> Everybody's got a favorite.<eos> Just because The Chairman loves you.<eos> Come on, everybody knows you play golf together in the off-season.
Can you give me a reason why not?<eos> Because I can't imagine spending the rest of my life with a man who finished second to Jed Perfectus.<eos> And besides, the winner gets to meet The Chairman.<eos> Yes, oh, God, that is disgusting.<eos> You are awful, awful, awful ugly people.
He is the head of the facility where Zack was institutionalized.<eos> Dr. Roshan, thank you so much for being here.<eos> Do you have any idea how Zack managed to escape?<eos> Uh, not yet.<eos> Unfortunately, as you are aware,
It was you, Victoria.<eos> Me? !<eos> And you, Daniel.<eos> And you, Emer.<eos> You all killed Stephen Langham together, didn't you?
You all killed Stephen Langham together, didn't you?<eos> This is ridiculous.<eos> You're not serious?<eos> I'm deadly serious.<eos> You all three of you murdered Mr Langham and staged it to look like he died of natural causes.
So, who did the phone belong to?<eos> It belonged to you lot.<eos> And I believe you placed it up there with the seismometer.<eos> You then dialled it intermittently over a three-night period to upset the readings from the extremely sensitive instruments and lead Stephen to think it was cause for concern.<eos> The afternoon of his murder, you both headed up to supposedly check on the seismometer.
Will he be giving an update on President-Elect Vargas' condition?<eos> Not at this time.<eos> Can you give us an update now?<eos> The President-Elect is being treated by a team of the best doctors and surgeons on the East Coast.<eos> As soon as they have an update, you will, too.
You all have to leave.<eos> Now.<eos> He's just trying to give your school some money.<eos> Don't be a problem.<eos> You are the problem here, not the solution.
- Salamanca blood!<eos> - You have to calm down.<eos> That hacienda!<eos> I paid for it.<eos> And you treat us like dogs.
Some doctors have tried to deal with strong corticosteroids, which are synthetic drugs that are used for a variety of ailments, but with mixed results. And it is not a proven treatment.<eos> We can try, right?<eos> Is it a good idea?<eos> Do you think it's worth it?<eos> Personally I do not think it's worth the side effects, but I'm willing to do what you want.
Personally I do not think it's worth the side effects, but I'm willing to do what you want.<eos> Bailey, what do you think?<eos> -I do not care.<eos> -Gumman, This is important.<eos> Honestly, I do as you wish.
It's more like a shadow, but with very few details.<eos> Why did not you?<eos> I do not know.<eos> I was scared.<eos> I knew you would start treating me differently and it's not quite the same to go shopping.
Yes, but I'm the only one who knows the code to open it.<eos> Perhaps you can persuade our friend to cooperate? Me?<eos> No.<eos> I'd rather see how this plays out.<eos> It seems you two have formed an alliance. There's just one problem.
We don't have time for this.<eos> Oh, I've got all the time in the world.<eos> Okay!<eos> Okay, you two have made your point.<eos> I need you as much as you need me, all right.
What a surprise.<eos> MOONEY: My goodness, Harvey, you look awful.<eos> It's good to see you, too.<eos> We just want Strange.<eos> You can walk away.
(siren wailing) He's following directions or something.<eos> I've got to find out who's controlling him, who's brainwashed him.<eos> And then what?<eos> (explosions) I'm gonna kill the bastard.<eos> You two wait here.
According to my sources, Fish Mooney and the GCPD are scrambling to recover the antidote to this virus.<eos> But Fish is dead.<eos> And Hugo Strange, who designed the antidote, is setting up a lab in the GCPD, but they are missing one very, very important element.<eos> So, yes, I am sure that this bozo is the key to controlling Gotham.<eos> Are you my saviors?
And now Barbara's partners with him?<eos> That's the mother of all insults.<eos> The city is gonna pay us a lot of money to get Tetch back.<eos> We need to let that play out before we do anything rash.<eos> I know you two are close.
Oh, my God.<eos> Vinny.<eos> I'm sorry, Tina.<eos> Aw, so sweet.<eos> I thought you two were just Cop buddies, but... you can tell me, Vin.
- Hey!<eos> Hi.<eos> - Hello...<eos> Hi. - Hi.<eos> You two are, uh...
My son graduated that day.<eos> And I could not have been prouder.<eos> My son honored that commitment.<eos> He made the ultimate sacrifice.<eos> So I honor his memory every time I put on this uniform, just as you honor the memory of every officer who has given his or her life in the line of duty.
Yeah, me, too.<eos> So, I was thinking, you know, uh... the three bedroom only has one full bath.<eos> I mean, it's still kind of small.<eos> So, what I'm saying, is there's a... one-bedroom opening up down the hall.<eos> I was thinking that might be better, I mean, you know, if you moved in there, we'd have more bathrooms and more private space.
Hey, hey, hey!<eos> What is going on in here?<eos> - You and Mama know!<eos> - What?<eos> You want Brandon to have her because you always want
Well, there must have been an opening in the schedule, because it's a week from today.<eos> Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry!<eos> I figured you might want that after homo sex-ed.<eos> I want you to know... I feel terrible about what happened with Monte.<eos> I... I never wanted her job, and I know you two are close.
A good education is not a privilege.<eos> It's a right.<eos> We cannot continue to take away from the poor... to give to the wealthy.<eos> No new auditorium, or improved computer lab... is worth betraying these kids that we serve.<eos> These kids that you know and love.
Yes. Of course.<eos> Go. Have fun.<eos> Everyone should have fun tonight.<eos> Just quickly, though...<eos> Might have buried the headline here... You all saved my life, and 5 months ago, I never would have thought that was possible.
No.<eos> Uh, no. You're right.<eos> Ok.<eos> So quid pro quo.<eos> I help you, you help me.
Oliver.<eos> We're not targets, man.<eos> We're your teammates.<eos> We're your strength.<eos> You give me strength until Chase turns it into a weakness.
I'm sorry.<eos> The fight for the kingdom is not over, my friends.<eos> Even now the castle and its people are in danger.<eos> Without the Heartfire, I will not have enough strength to help you.<eos> So, it's time for you, the dragonhearted, to uphold the Code
Catherine Cardinal.<eos> Right?<eos> She came to us at a difficult time.<eos> I hope we were able to provide some comfort.<eos> She wanted to believe that faith could heal her and you let her.
Right now.<eos> As the world moves around you, you too are capable of moving.<eos> You are your single self.<eos> Not attached to anyone.<eos> Just as people and circumstances change, you also have a greater power within you.
Don't worry. I'll continue to do it for you.<eos> Less talk, more work, boys.<eos> I'm not paying you to coffee klatsch like a bunch of fucking yentas.<eos> You're not paying us at all.<eos> I'm not paying you because you're not the one getting fucked face-first by your credit card company because of massive AWS hosting fees.
Commoners, nobles, they're all just children, really.<eos> They won't obey you unless they fear you.<eos> I'm grateful to you, Lady Olenna, for your counsel.<eos> I'm grateful to all of you.<eos> But you have chosen to follow me.
Winter is here, Your Grace.<eos> We need the King in the North in the North.<eos> - Men:<eos> Aye! - ( pounding tables )<eos> You all crowned me your king.
Don't move!<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> I'm a pilot.<eos> I fly the drones.<eos> Who are you?
And I'm Jerome, the shot caller of our little gang.<eos> We're here to spread the message of wisdom and hope.<eos> Some people have no manners.<eos> You're all prisoners.<eos> What you call sanity, it's just a prison in your minds that stops you from seeing you're just tiny little cogs in a giant, absurd machine,
And that's the night I changed.<eos> Don't waste your breath, Jim.<eos> Let's put him on a bus to Blackgate, stick a target on his back and forget about him!<eos> Good cop, bad cop doesn't work on cops.<eos> At the very least, you two should have switched roles.
I mean, anything that might indicate where he was going, what he was planning.<eos> We were just playing catch-up.<eos> You know, about coming back to life, the cult.<eos> He asked if you and I were still together.<eos> I mentioned you killed my husband on our wedding night, and he thought that was hilarious, so that's something the two of you can bond over when you find him.
Who's gonna kill him?<eos> Who's gonna do it?<eos> - I'll do it. - What?<eos> What, you three?<eos> You three left here to take out the rubbish, were you?
What a surprise.<eos> My goodness, Harvey, you look awful.<eos> It's good to see you, too.<eos> We just want Strange.<eos> You can walk away.
He's following directions or something.<eos> I've got to find out who's controlling him, who's brainwashed him.<eos> And then what?<eos> I'm gonna kill the bastard.<eos> You two wait here.

- I... this is for me?<eos> - It's for the housewarming.<eos> - Wow!<eos> - Hey.<eos> You two did really well.
Maybe we can use that to get through to him.<eos> - Yes, okay.<eos> - Great, yeah, I'm coming too.<eos> No. I'm sorry, Jesse, no.<eos> Look, I didn't come here for you to take all the risk.
Uh, we mean you no harm.<eos> Please... just let me and my friends go, and I promise, we'll never come back here again.<eos> My brethren have seen you.<eos> Your fate is sealed.<eos> You will all die by my hand... in the arena... so that all will know that Solovar's justice is wise and swift.
My baby girl.<eos> You have grown into a beautiful woman.<eos> You're marrying the best man I know.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You two bring me nothing but joy.
This is S.T.A.R. Labs.<eos> St... Labs?<eos> A laboratory?<eos> St... a laboratory?<eos> What are you?
If you want some of this behind, you better scale up.<eos> A first-class casino would've comped us a room and had these winnings secure in a safe by now.<eos> You know, just saying.<eos> Sir, madam.<eos> If you would like, we could put your winnings in one of our vaults.
We've had two murders in two days.<eos> The police have no idea what's going on, and...<eos> Well, that's why we're here.<eos> Now you said victim number two brought some Timber Troopers through here, right?<eos> 16 hours ago, they were standing right where you are.
That's not true.<eos> Dean, I'm trying...<eos> How 'bout for once, you just try to be a mom?<eos> I am your mother, but I am not "just a mom."<eos> And you are not a child.
Wait, what?<eos> Seriously?<eos> How?<eos> You American hunters tend to see vampires as criminals, rogues.<eos> One gets out of line, you show up, lop off its head, and leave town.
Gentlemen.<eos> Headmistress.<eos> Come with me.<eos> Timothy,<eos> Michael, you have both conquered many trials here at kendricks, either through natural talent or good old-fashioned hard work.
It was the wrong thing to do.<eos> I knew that straightaway.<eos> Are you married, Lucas?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Trish told us that you two have been out for a drink.
Yep.<eos> I'll get you a discount, if you like.<eos> Come on, Leo, get your arse into gear.<eos> All right?<eos> - Hi. You two know each other?
When you find out what this is all about, come and tell me, with a bit of bloody sympathy.<eos> - Quite the pasting he gave him.<eos> - Oh, typical!<eos> A woman gets attacked and the men go round butting horns, making it about them.<eos> - What are you two doing here?
I expect repayment.<eos> I hear you, Ceolwulf.<eos> I consider our lands to be one...<eos> No, we are not one.<eos> We are Mercia and you are Wessex.
Oh, I don't know... psych!<eos> [ding]<eos> One hundred percent!<eos> Out of what?<eos> You two are the only ones who've ever gotten a perfect score.
We've all turned our backs on sin.<eos> The tragedy is that young man did not do the same.<eos> The tragedy is that he was the victim of a hate crime.<eos> Every weekend, young men are pulled out of those clubs on stretchers, veins full of street drugs, hearts full of despair.<eos> What are you doing about that?
We call them "Let Her Rip."<eos> I love it.<eos> I love it all.<eos> He loves it all!<eos> These are great ideas and you're both fantastic.
I would prefer it if you participate voluntarily, but as I believe Mr. Poe has explained to you, I can act loco parentheses.<eos> In loco parentis.<eos> Poco De Laurentiis.<eos> In loco parentis.<eos> The point is, I can order you to participate, and you must obey.
Until then, she will remain in the tower room for safekeeping.<eos> - That is all.<eos> - You're a terrible man.<eos> I may be a terrible man, but I have concocted a foolproof way of getting your fortune.<eos> What have you done?
- The wedding will be around 10:00 p.m., followed by champagne toasts, reception with cake and finger food, then the after-party at the Mexican place.<eos> Check.<eos> I'm just glad the Baudelaires are adjusting to their new life.<eos> I had my doubts about Count Olaf, but now that I see he's putting three young children in the theater, all my anxieties are put to rest.<eos> You two will stay right here until the wedding scene.
Adoption law you<eos> The Baudelaires did not understand why they were now off toward an unknown relative instead of living with Justice Strauss.<eos> But as with so many unfortunate events in life, just because you don't understand it, doesn't mean it isn't so.<eos> Usually, our theatrical reviews are the most boring part of the paper.<eos> But I bet you little stage hogs are about to make the front page again.
The cry you're hearing is that of the broken-hearted crocodile.<eos> It is a rare species of reptile found in swampy regions that are particularly sad.<eos> Woe is me. Woe is me.<eos> My name is Lemony Snicket, and it is my sworn duty to carefully research the dire plight of the Baudelaire orphans.<eos> But there is no reason for you to make yourself as miserable and melancholy as I am.
- We know what ridicule means.<eos> I can still smell that ginger.<eos> I hope Dr. Montgomery is a decent person.<eos> Hello, hello, hello.<eos> - You must be the Baudelaires.
- You're laughing?<eos> I'm terribly sorry, children.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> But the incredibly deadly viper is one of the friendliest and least dangerous animals in the entire animal kingdom.<eos> It will come to no harm and neither will you.
Go, go. Go, go.<eos> Seventh row, right of center, that is the best place.<eos> That's what our mother always said.<eos> Who do you think taught it to me?<eos> You know, kids, I am so happy to be seeing a movie with you.
- Sounds wonderful.<eos> - Doesn't it?<eos> Listen, children.<eos> I know that the loss of your parents was a great tragedy.<eos> But you can still have the life they wanted for you.
I wouldn't have had to kill Monty and we'd all be on our way to Peru, where I would have had to kill Monty.<eos> God, I hate driving stick.<eos> You're just gonna leave him there?<eos> Trust me, he doesn't mind.<eos> Of course, after they discover he's dead, you'll be long gone, and I'll be taking advantage of Peru's extremely lax guardianship laws.
Call a scientist!<eos> Call my wife!<eos> This is ghastly!<eos> This is phantasmagorical!<eos> You are police officers!
I think it's part of a spyglass.<eos> It certainly is.<eos> I will get it back to you, Klaus Baudelaire.<eos> I promise.<eos> Who are you?
And I'm not perfect.<eos> I'm not always right.<eos> I don't always win.<eos> I fucked up. I did do something wrong.<eos> If that makes me a bad person, well, you'll have to decide that for yourselves, not just once, but many times more as you grow older and you learn more.
Sweet!<eos> Let's go.<eos> Off the bike.<eos> Come on.<eos> You two stay there.
They're still hindered by national boundaries, which makes it easier for us to cut their legs off from under them.<eos> You aren't afraid of getting your hands dirty, are you?<eos> -Not at all.<eos> -Good.<eos> -Who are you people?
Do not stand at my grave and cry.<eos> I am not there, I did not die.<eos> -We can't compete with the Cabal Uptime.<eos> They are bigger than us and have unlimited resources.<eos> If you're not gonna help me, I'll find someone who will.
A minimum of eight.<eos> Well, if you can get eight girls to sign up, you can have your team.<eos> Yes!<eos> But there are no school funds left.<eos> So whatever the costs for this team, you'll have to cover on your own.
Savanah, you're going.<eos> It's good for the team, okay?<eos> Hello, Savanah.<eos> Hi, Mr. Janson.<eos> You two know each other?
Go home!<eos> Go home! Hey!<eos> Leave her alone!<eos> Her father is fighting Afghanistan right now!<eos> And she is more American than you'll ever be!
Wasn't a forced entry though.<eos> So...<eos> So, uh... what should I do now?<eos> Uh, about what?<eos> I mean... do you call me or...?
Oh, my God.<eos> You know what, stop ragging on my girlfriend.<eos> It's really hard to get excited about a future with someone when you guys are always shitting on her.<eos> - I'm not shitting on her.<eos> - Yes, you are. You all do.
Think you invented giving French names to sexy things?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Aren't you too big for this?<eos> We're small potatoes.<eos> You're not small potatoes, Nick.
Because you were going to take a trip without ever talking to him.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Don't leave.<eos> I'm not leaving.<eos> I just think you two need for me not to be here.
Did you talk to Jennifer McMahon about it?<eos> Did Detective Miller have sympathies toward the Insurgency?<eos> Beau?<eos> If he did, he kept 'em hidden from me.<eos> You worked together to turn Alexander Quayle, a key member of Broussard's cell.
Put that audio file on a thumb drive.<eos> I'll take it to Hennessey, see if he has any ideas.<eos> So once again you're going for a stroll around town while we're all stuck underground doing nothing?<eos> I know how to handle myself.<eos> You don't.
I wouldn't ask if it wasn't important.<eos> Please.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Good morning.<eos> What are you two conspiring about?
There's no good out here.<eos> He wants to talk to you.<eos> You're lucky, you know?<eos> The two of you.<eos> Not everyone gets what you have.
Says they're gonna kill him just to tie up loose ends.<eos> Yeah, shades of ISIS, man.<eos> I put him in a safe house until things cool down.<eos> Whether or not he stays put...<eos> You have all been very stupid.
But what would I say?<eos> Hmm? I had no proof, and it was his word against mine.<eos> And when I confronted him on it, he reassigned me to the transportation department, and he said if I ever complained, he would blacklist my name all over town!<eos> Why are you telling us all this?<eos> Because, I can tell that you two are up to something, and if it involves causing any Hooterville to Mr. Wolf, I'm in.
Doesn't matter.<eos> I mean, fine.<eos> I mean, you got me with your little sophomoric prank, right?<eos> But, big picture?<eos> I'm the winner. You're the loser!
Uh? Holding this, I feel only hours of tedious practice.<eos> Where is the joy?<eos> That was beautiful, honey!<eos> No, it wasn't.<eos> I finally feel about my sax... the way you all do.
I don't think so.<eos> Then I have the right to know why.<eos> And I'm not going anywhere until you tell me.<eos> Sorry we weren't able to land you at night and spare you the shock of our sun and sky, but the Navy had fly-over restrictions in effect.<eos> I hope the strain of Earth's gravity hasn't been too much for you to bear.
Why didn't you tell me they were gonna say that?<eos> Because I knew you'd react like this.<eos> Travis was a good soldier.<eos> He died for Mars.<eos> And you all just threw him into the goddamn crusher.
Everyone is afraid of change, but when life is screaming, "This is your new truth,"<eos> you need to accept it, be bold, be brave, and live your new truth, no matter what it is.<eos> Okay, I would just add that sometimes we may think life is telling us our truth, but we might not have enough information yet.<eos> So, it's important to explore all the options and exhaust every possibility before doing something crazy.<eos> But, of course, you should buy this house.
Yes, we're gonna fuck it.<eos> All night long.<eos> So... what would that cost?<eos> We'd want to take it with us, of course, because we're shy.<eos> Well, you know, it's gonna cost extra 'cause there's two of you.
We're ready to execute.<eos> Repeat.<eos> We are ready to execute.<eos> Do you copy?<eos> You two are in the wrong place.
You wanted to present a happy family.<eos> The woman you were having an affair with threatens to blackmail you, endanger your political ambitions.<eos> So you kill her.<eos> Seems like that'd be pretty easy for a jury to understand.<eos> This will never go to trial, and you know it.
- Where's Nick?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> He got away.<eos> - How'd he do that?<eos> - You tell me.
- Oh, really?<eos> You have a lot of experience with the Verfluchte Zwillingsschwester?<eos> If Bonaparte was still alive, you wouldn't be.<eos> Your mistake has cost us more than you know.<eos> No, my mistake was thinking that you knew what you were doing.
Why don't you close the door?<eos> Well, we've all made mistakes.<eos> That was one hell of an undercover operation that "we" pulled off.<eos> Yeah, you looked pretty good on TV.<eos> Yeah, well, you didn't.
- I don't know... What?<eos> We went to bed about 10:00, 10:30.<eos> I heard Auggie crying about 1:30 in the morning.<eos> We called 911.<eos> I mean, don't you have
Let's tone this down.<eos> I think you guys need to leave our house right now.<eos> No, you need to cool it.<eos> Unless you want to leave this house with us.<eos> Maybe you don't care if everybody thinks my wife's crazy, but I do.
Drop your weapons!<eos> Easy, boys, we're just here to talk to your suspect.<eos> You both need to take a big step back, put down your guns, and put your hands...<eos> Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> Where the hell were you two just now?
She was forged in the 9th circle of Detroit.<eos> See for yourself.<eos> The case of guns from this morning's bust, where are they?<eos> They've been requisitioned back to the ATF.<eos> Wow, you two look stressed.
Listen, I've been out here 18 months without leave.<eos> I miss my kid, I miss my wife.<eos> I spent our anniversary hiding under a desk, trying to get the internet to work while getting mortared.<eos> I'm sure that the NSA is used to getting whatever the hell it wants, but whatever it wants from me is gonna have to wait. There is nothing in this world that is gonna make me miss Christmas with my family.<eos> You suck.
Anyone not inside the hall by then won't be participating.<eos> There are 390 applications for just 12 positions.<eos> Twelve fortunate women will be getting the best job of their lives. So look sharp.<eos> Follow me, please.<eos> You're in Madrid's most modern building.
It's going to be very hard to choose.<eos> If only we could buy more switchboards and give you all jobs.<eos> -[√Ångeles chuckles] -[pencil clatters]<eos> Thank you.<eos> I don't want to make you more nervous than you already are, so good luck to all of you.
The operator protocol.<eos> Learn it as if your life depended on it.<eos> I can assure you, it does.<eos> The other switchboards will be disconnected for ten minutes.<eos> So all you need to do is witness this moment.
You were struggling before she left.<eos> And at noon today, the whole world is going to know that you suffered another blow.<eos> The only thing the world's gonna know is, Jessica had such confidence in our abilities that she decided to move on to another phase of her career.<eos> I don't care how you want to spin it.<eos> Even if you manage to keep your clients, you've got a boulder headed your way, and you know it.
I don't care how you want to spin it.<eos> Even if you manage to keep your clients, you've got a boulder headed your way, and you know it.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Which one of you two is gonna take Jessica's seat at the table?<eos> Because you can only avoid that question for so long, and my money says that the second I leave this room, you two are gonna fight to the death.
Sean Cahill has as much sway over that committee as I do, and he owes Mike;<eos> I don't.<eos> So why aren't you going to him?<eos> Because a word from the woman who put him away is worth a thousand from the guy who got him out.<eos> Nice try, but you two did something to get that kid out, and you don't want to shine a light on that by appearing together in public.
Every word of these articles is true.<eos> I never should have been at Pearson Specter.<eos> But not being a lawyer isn't the only reason I didn't belong there.<eos> You see, the whole reason that I wanted to be a lawyer in the first place was so that I could help the kind of people that come into this clinic every single day.<eos> Now, I thought you all knew this, but it's clear to me now that you don't.
I guarantee you, Sofia Price isn't laughing.<eos> Well, any judge in his right mind is gonna laugh you out of court, because you don't understand the law.<eos> No, you're the one that doesn't understand the law,<eos> Ms. Johnson.<eos> You started demolition with tenants still in your building.
And I don't believe a goddamn thing you were told to say in that room.<eos> I need to know who is doing this and why.<eos> I need your help.<eos> This has to be a mind game.<eos> You are the enemy.
- Oh, for sure.<eos> - Nancy's loss was my gain.<eos> Fo' sho.<eos> Fo' sho.<eos> You two are a trip.
Relax, you still have plenty of time to get to work.<eos> No, you spoon.<eos> I have to get a dress to Marin.<eos> I had it planned.<eos> It was gonna get picked up and then you two had to be all nice and fun and loving...
Oh, God.<eos> Well, I don't mean to be a threat to you, grand poo-bah.<eos> Okay, that's not funny.<eos> Holder of the drink tickets that I never get.<eos> The drink tickets are meant as a reward for those who bring in other people, and you two are always by yourselves, okay?
Because I know what you and Mike are doing to make this happen.<eos> Rachel, this letter has nothing to do with what we're doing.<eos> You deserve this and all this guy is doing is the right thing.<eos> Okay, let's say that's true.<eos> What about what you two are doing to make the same thing happen for Mike?
- The system.<eos> - Quotas.<eos> - Like, racial quotas? - My least favorite motive.<eos> There's no racial quotas.<eos> Look, you're a lot older, and Will and I, we didn't look at race the same way the older generation does.
Made a marijuana bale so real, we could sell it.<eos> And, apparently, you'd know? Okay, I was undercover for five years with drug-dealing nazis.<eos> So sometimes they liked to party.<eos> Sometimes I had to inhale.<eos> Detectives, you have a black cargo van.
And then Tasha. And then me.<eos> Guess what?<eos> I don't feel safe.<eos> Ghost ain't got nothin' to do with mine and Tasha's business.<eos> Yeah, but I do, 'cause you all got me twisted up in this bullshit.
But you know me.<eos> I go where the work is.<eos> You go where the cameras are.<eos> Yeah, they're often in the same place.<eos> Look, I want a conviction as much as you do.
Do it fast.<eos> This needs to end... before somebody else gets killed.<eos> _<eos> It's your fault.<eos> You arrested Hector.
What's your name?<eos> Okay, my name is Officer Kim Burgess, and this is a crime scene, so if you know something and you can help us in some way...<eos> Help you?<eos> They are killing our daughters, and you're asking me for my help?<eos> - You're the police!
I do mind.<eos> If you want to talk to him, I'll try and make it work, but this is our home.<eos> Sir, if I may... help us out here, okay?<eos> Grace was murdered.<eos> You knew her.
We know about the threats you made, in case you're wondering, "What am I doing here?"<eos> You want to tell us about Vincent Avinell?<eos> Nothing to say about him.<eos> He's scared of you.<eos> Guess you two had a beef over Grace Johnson?
I don't know what to say. Look, I'm glad you ran the tests.<eos> Because...<eos> It saved me a lot of time.<eos> What the hell was this?<eos> What did you two want?
Thank you.<eos> Good night, Sire.<eos> Your mistress will be waiting for you.<eos> No! It is you I need tonight.<eos> When you look at yourselves, what do you see?
You're the guys working for Gavin Belson.<eos> Was working with Gavin Belson, yeah.<eos> So, he's not coming?<eos> No. No, not at all.<eos> But I'll have you all know that without any involvement from Gavin Belson,
Thank you, Mr. Sherwood.<eos> Will...<eos> They're criminals.<eos> I mean, we should call IDPH, have their license revoked.<eos> You've all achieved something very special today.
'Cause we're less than.<eos> That's exactly... It's exactly what I'm saying.<eos> - I'll take care of your money. - Yeah.<eos> I'll take care of your body.<eos> You really got a fucking problem, you know that?
You think we don't know what's going on here?<eos> You double booked the room to scare us into overbidding.<eos> You're right.<eos> We should have known a couple of smart guys like you would never fall for the banana in the tailpipe.<eos> We brought you down here just because you were the only two bidders who came in at 100 million, so now, you have to look each other in the eye while you go headtohead.
You got one chance to write down your best bid.<eos> Winner takes all, loser goes home.<eos> We'll be back in 15 minutes, and we better see some more zeroes.<eos> What if we collude, right here?<eos> Stick at 100 and you're shit out of luck?
Hello!<eos> Oh, bollocks.<eos> Not again.<eos> Saltonstall: Today...<eos> You will compete in a series of trials designed to test your abilities.
I saw the flag in your window. It's Serbian.<eos> - I saw it in my research.<eos> - Let go.<eos> - Do you speak Serbian?<eos> - You people are insane.
- Mind if I call you Ben?<eos> - Yes, actually, I mind very much.<eos> But you open up that checkbook of yours, and you can call Ben here whatever the hell you want.<eos> I appreciate that, but before we get started, you should know that we get pitched six personal assistant devices a month.<eos> And you should know that our device makes Siri and the Alexa look like toaster ovens.
He said someone's gonna meet us.<eos> - All right, go with Mommy. - What about you?<eos> - What about you?<eos> - No.<eos> No, no, it's all right. You go. Go!
So...<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll be driving.<eos> All right.<eos> You two and the rug rat will be in the trunk.
I know it's not been easy with Steve gone.<eos> He was¬êhe was our father, and our leader, our friend, and I wanted to bring the same and more, and I failed.<eos> But...<eos> I would like to try again.<eos> I'm gonna do everything I can to fix this, to get us out of debt, And you will not suffer.
It's very imperfect.<eos> I'll sort out what happened at the border when Jake gets back.<eos> Meanwhile, this is the safest place to live in a world gone mad.<eos> Most people would be damn grateful for being here.<eos> I had the idea you might be, too.
All of them?<eos> You want to start that fight?<eos> Then you'll see murder.<eos> You know it's my fault?<eos> I led Lucy and her people to that place, and you came there looking for me.
It's covered.<eos> Your ship is a rust-bucket, cobbled together with spare parts.<eos> That's my specialty.<eos> If you want to get out of here, and help these people, you need me.<eos> You people are shit-magnets...
Let me give you a little context.<eos> My girlfriend's in real estate.<eos> One day, she notices a spike in interest in Sandicot, which is, you know, curious, to say the fucking least.<eos> Then, the same week, a friend of mine notices a couple guys eating burgers at Murdock's... haircuts wearing expensive sneakers.<eos> So I go down to Town Hall to see what's what, and I find out that you bought the town's debt for pennies on the dollar.
I can't deliver that vengeance.<eos> I didn't have that much one-on-one time with Axe.<eos> He was used to flirting with Wendy Rhoades.<eos> I offered a different kind of medicine.<eos> So I didn't have access to the kind of conversations that you're interested in.
He's actually vaping alcohol.<eos> It really enhances the flavor of the green fairy.<eos> Maybe you say "when," Wags.<eos> Apart from being able to smoke your beverages, how is this different from where we would have taken you?<eos> You would have brought us to a demeaning, run-of-the-mill titty bar.
You care to be a little more specific about the orders you didn't want to follow?<eos> I signed an NDA.<eos> If I tell you any details about Axe Cap, I expose myself to liability.<eos> And the loss of a classic-six.<eos> Look, you're the lawyers.
We're looking at a police force at half-capacity.<eos> The library is open 12 hours a week.<eos> Why, that is... revolting.<eos> No, I see what's happening here.<eos> You are not invisible. You matter.
Chuck was, um... quite surprised to hear from you.<eos> Well, I'm glad you came.<eos> Bobby will really value you being here.<eos> I couldn't tell when I spoke to him at work.<eos> I thought you weren't really talking at work.
He doesn't care about the relics.<eos> He wants the ranch.<eos> We have until sundown tomorrow to clear out.<eos> Or die.<eos> You two have never been to Montgomery.
She took the gun out of her daddy's dresser.<eos> She shot him.<eos> Shot him while he slept off the night before.<eos> Yeah.<eos> My mama looked at me then like you're looking at me now.
She killed my brother!<eos> - That is enough!<eos> - She did it, I'm telling you.<eos> - We don't know it was anyone for sure.<eos> You were the ones who suspected, you came asking questions.
He's... he's helping.<eos> Idiot!<eos> Why didn't you get clear?<eos> You had to watch, huh?<eos> You two set off the bomb?
- Who is this guy?<eos> - He was on the bus.<eos> On the bus?<eos> A human?<eos> ! You two are blowing up buses and you don't even know they use them to transport human prisoners?
Throw it down!<eos> Keys!<eos> Come on!<eos> Well, your timing's impeccable.<eos> You were the one who got yourself captured.
She's not supposed to be here.<eos> She wasn't auditioning.<eos> She just came to stomp the homewrecker.<eos> I see what happened.<eos> You all thought that was real, didn't you?
- Where do we go?<eos> - Yeah, I'm going!<eos> This process is simply a security check.<eos> Thank you for your patience, cooperation, and welcome to your new community.<eos> You, stay there!
That wasn't my intent, Madame Speaker.<eos> If I may?<eos> All of you are new to Congress, but one thing we have in common is the oath we took to uphold the Constitution.<eos> I've always done my best to live up to that oath.<eos> There may be little hard evidence here for you to investigate, but there is a lifetime of public service to consider.
We deserve to know if Al-Sakar did not perpetrate the Capitol bombing.<eos> I'm afraid my government agrees, Mr. President.<eos> We have learned from our mistakes in Iraq.<eos> We cannot discuss your initiative any further without knowing the truth.<eos> If my esteemed colleagues will excuse me, you are not seriously suggesting that the French and British don't have classified intelligence that they keep secret for reasons of national security.
Roman used to work at a missile base down the street.<eos> - Is there a weapon? - So he says.<eos> Goodweather is out there somewhere.<eos> My legion is searching for them. As well as rounding up every nuclear weapon.<eos> You two are blowing up buses and you don't know they use them to transport human prisoners?
You know what I mean.<eos> No matter how you might have felt about your old life... it was better than this.<eos> Slide me that weapon.<eos> You wanna lock the door, sweetheart?<eos> What are you two doing here?
Oh, Abraham, I know he doesn't.<eos> I just need to hear you say it!<eos> I'll see you... in hell, Eichhorst.<eos> Yes. But you are already there.<eos> You are the lucky ones. The shaving is just the first step in a new radiation inoculation, which will help with the potential side effects from the Illumination.
I, uh, might have stretched the truth about exactly how much silver we saw being loaded - into the truck.<eos> - How much did you see?<eos> Approximately?<eos> - None. - What?<eos> Hold on. Oh, come on! You're telling me we risked our lives taking this convoy so that you could get plutonium and we could get nothing?
I know his health wasn't all that good.<eos> Uh, William died last week.<eos> In Memphis.<eos> Well, he always wanted to get back there.<eos> I didn't realize you two had gotten to know each other.
It was Timothy's phone.<eos> 'Brilliant.<eos> Thank you.'<eos> 'But I wasn't harming anyone.'<eos> You have ruined my life.
Aren't you supposed to be on bed rest?<eos> Thinking calm thoughts, watching TV shows?<eos> Dr. Park says the baby and I are doing just fine.<eos> Thank goodness.<eos> But why don't you two keep an eye on me?
Groupies are the most humane way... A willing food supply.<eos> Humane?<eos> She can barely move.<eos> A stop at the Waffle House, and Tiffany will be as good as new.<eos> It's a hard thing to understand, since you're not one of us.
You're always innocent Until proven guilty, right?<eos> Remember how mom told us The story of the treasure in our wood?<eos> You really believed it.<eos> You skipped school next day. Because you were desperate To find the treasure.<eos> I couldn't believe you both thought It was only a fairy tale.
Lorenz, bnd. We'll take it from here.<eos> What?<eos> Don't worry.<eos> All I want is an informal chat.<eos> You have no jurisdiction!
She was killing the other day with that. All right?<eos> I swear.<eos> Do the thing I like.<eos> I am Zoya... the Destroya.<eos> You are weak capitalist dog.
Sure, sure, sure.<eos> But maybe KDTV has an extra studio<eos> - as an alternative.<eos> - Mr. Howard, we were very explicit about this.<eos> We provide the cameras and the airwaves, you provide everything else.
Crack should be my middle name.<eos> And also my first and my last name.<eos> Eggs, bacon, bangers and mash, toast, marmite and crack.<eos> I went to three rehabs.<eos> Uh, Hazelden was the best one, so, you know, you guys... Now, if you have, like, a... If you have a fucked-up kid or whatever.
Badges up.<eos> "Never know"?<eos> Why?<eos> Because Dr. Eldredge is already pissed you're here.<eos> You're doing fancy, expensive surgery.
Why?<eos> Because Dr. Eldredge is already pissed you're here.<eos> You're doing fancy, expensive surgery.<eos> Special treatment gets the others all riled up, you know.<eos> Eldredge pushes you, you push back.
For both of you, but I think it's important for you to know you are not legally a guardian of Louie's, since only Ms. Dawson's name appears on the foster application.<eos> So, we're... we're married now and we filed for papers to officially adopt him,<eos> - But those papers haven't even been considered yet.<eos> Fact is, you're still facing long odds.<eos> Knowing all that, you need to think hard about whether or not you're going to pursue permanent guardianship of Louie.
Louie is a great kid, but he's been through a lot.<eos> This isn't something you just jump into because you think you should.<eos> No, I know that, but I can handle this.<eos> My parents, my sisters, they all wanna be a part of it, to bring this boy back to our family.<eos> Just forget about the guardianship stuff for now, that's for the courts, but you understand,
It can't be that I've lost someone so important.<eos> It can't be that I will never see them again.<eos> It can't be, it can't be... it can't be.<eos> My name is Lemony Snicket, and it is my job to report the history of the Baudelaire orphans, but it can't be that you have nothing better to do.<eos> The Baudelaires believed, incorrectly, that they would never see their Aunt Josephine again, but it can't be that you are interested in watching them suffer as her last words echo again and again throughout her empty and doomed house.
Please, there's no time for fishing jokes.<eos> There's a very simple way to tell who wrote this note.<eos> We simply have to compare it to your Aunt Josephine's handwriting.<eos> That's... actually an excellent idea.<eos> You are very intelligent children, but even the most intelligent people sometimes need the help of a banker.
It means the Fickle Ferry isn't running at all.<eos> Then how are we gonna get to Curdled Cave?<eos> Pirate style.<eos> There is also fine print attached to this sad tale.<eos> A number of concerned people are worried that if you watch the Baudelaire orphans steal a sailboat and sail across Lake Lachrymose in the middle of Hurricane Herman...
We're taking the sailboat back to the town, and we're taking you with us.<eos> No way, Jose.<eos> I am too frightened of Count Olaf to face him.<eos> But if you tell Mr. Poe what happened, then Count Olaf will be locked away and we'll be safe, all of us.<eos> You can tell him that if you want.
We're all afraid.<eos> We were afraid when you brought home Count Olaf. We were afraid when we thought you had jumped out a window.<eos> We were afraid to give ourselves allergic reactions, we were afraid to steal a sailboat, and we were afraid to make our way across Lake Lachrymose in the middle of a hurricane.<eos> But that didn't stop us!<eos> I can't help it if you are braver than I am.
That was brunch, and it's almost morning now.<eos> You didn't eat anything recently, did you, Aunt Josephine?<eos> Aunt Josephine?<eos> Banana.<eos> I ate a banana just before you arrived.
These are my siblings, Klaus and Sunny.<eos> Listen, I... I know things seem dark.<eos> But you have to look on the bright side.<eos> So your parents burned down towns.<eos> You don't have to be like your parents.
I'm going to pay my respects to the local sheriff.<eos> See if he's seen anything strange.<eos> - Anybody who doesn't belong.<eos> - Like us?<eos> Oh, no, you're fine.
Devouring. An uncatchable thief.<eos> My friends, it is only the passage of time that fools us into believing we are not forever.<eos> There is a reason... clocks are round.<eos> Every measure visible at once... every moment... past, present, and future... with you in the center.<eos> But what if you could ascend... from the center clock?
I can talk the talk.<eos> I should go.<eos> Very well.<eos> So you and Mr. Cole will retrieve the EMP.<eos> Mr. Whitley and Mr. Deacon, you'll provide egress.
This is bigger than us.<eos> You got to listen to me.<eos> We have to get off this island.<eos> They're gonna see everything he's doing. And hopefully, they'll see what a genius he is. Yeah, sure, or a madman.<eos> Then maybe you should leave.
I can skate.<eos> - Ooh, she talks. - Ha.<eos> That means you can say, "Congrats on your win, Bella."<eos> I think you mean, "Congrats on your win, Kris."<eos> So you're NPCs?
- in just a second.<eos> -<eos> I want to talk to you for just a moment about the purpose of this evening, why you're here, other than the fact that someone you consider socially desirable invited you.<eos> Half a mile from here in Canarsie, there are 30 young Novices sleeping on a concrete floor, dedicating themselves to the social mission of our movement.<eos> They are sacrificing and slaving to make a haven for the homeless of this city, for the homeless of this city, the sick, the disabled, the forgotten, people you walk past every day in the street
You got a girlfriend, Jarod?<eos> No, thanks.<eos> I... I really gotta get back to work.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You two sure know how to make a guy feel good about himself.
Oh, he'll understand.<eos> You talk to Meredith without me.<eos> You talk to Richard.<eos> You talk to Jackson.<eos> I mean, you two go way back.
Okay.<eos> People lie.<eos> And when people lie, they want to confess... it's human nature.<eos> Your job... you and you and you... is to enable that process.<eos> You are a crucial step to their cleansing.
There was a haartal... Strike in Farmgate.<eos> We are most busy.<eos> Please, this way.<eos> With the demands on the department, we have not made much progress on the case of the missing Americans.<eos> But, uh, it is okay with us you start.
Zip it.<eos> Did you know he was a terrorist?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Your patient in Syria, did you know he was a terrorist?<eos> Are you two together?
Dr. Picot attempted a second operation on the same terrorist.<eos> Arresting him again is prior restraint.<eos> Seriously?<eos> May I finish, Your Honor?<eos> Do you two know each other?
- The egg.<eos> Can you understand what I'm saying?<eos> Sometimes I find it difficult to hear myself.<eos> No, I can hear you.<eos> But you're a public institution, Doctor;
Oh, my God, thank you.<eos> I did not think that I was an emotional person, but look at me.<eos> It's an emotional thing.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> If I'm able to get pregnant, I just want you to know that it will be because of you.
- I win.<eos> I guessed you would say "political correctness"<eos> - within the first five minutes.<eos> - Well, that was almost funny.<eos> You know, you're in an unfortunate position to be funny because you're all Tom and Katie Buellers.
- It's 23, not 21.<eos> - Okay, Jerry, j-just...<eos> From the client's percentage of money he never would've seen if it weren't for the money we invested.<eos> Thank you.<eos> On February 20, just before the settlement, you gentlemen decided to increase your stake in the case by investing more money.
No.<eos> No, but I...<eos> I remember that he was there.<eos> You know, when I was, uh, about eight, I was on Bozo's Circus.<eos> And, uh... you're too young to remember this... but it was a really big deal.
Excuse me, please. Excuse me.<eos> Oh, yeah, this is too crowded.<eos> Shouldn't have wasted my speech on this moment.<eos> To the evidence room.<eos> You two need to figure out how to patch things up with Teddy.
What if we just...<eos> We keep enough food to make it to dry land.<eos> You're in charge.<eos> Greg and I are gonna supervise dumping the food.<eos> Phil, Nick, you two are gonna have to keep dumping water out of here.
You know who else was a legend?<eos> Dracula. The Wolf Man. Frankenstein.<eos> A fire-breathing dragon.<eos> You see where I'm going with this?<eos> Yeah, let me guess. You two have history?
Their heads almost exploded when I told them about your little lightning trick.<eos> Maybe leave that part out next time.<eos> What lightning trick?<eos> Oh, oh, I get it.<eos> You three spent some time in the woods together, now you have this bond that the rest of us wouldn't understand.
Cynthia, meet Riley and Bozer.<eos> Riley and Bozer, meet the most badass helicopter pilot I've ever seen.<eos> - Nice to meet you.<eos> - Nice to meet you.<eos> You Boy Scouts saved my life.
He's been on their radar for years, targeted in multiple investigations, and then somehow has slipped through the cracks every single time.<eos> You think he's got an agent in his pocket, helping him escape?<eos> I think that there's reason to suspect it, and until we know the truth, we can't trust anyone at the FBI.<eos> We want Bishop to answer for killing a federal agent, we're just gonna have to catch him ourselves.<eos> Mac, Jack, you'll find Bishop.
That was awesome!<eos> Now, let's never do it again.<eos> Just a reminder.<eos> Don't tell the Hun about our little run-in with the feds, all right?<eos> Yep. I was thinking the same thing. And you thought you didn't need to tell me about stealing a car from two FBI agents because you were hoping I wouldn't find out?
But it's not the headline here.<eos> We were in Bishop's apartment two minutes before the feds showed up, and they were from Philly.<eos> We're already looking at every fed in the Philly office.<eos> This now moves your new pals, Brooks and Cho, to the top of the suspect list.<eos> But I needed you two to find Bishop before the feds.

No, we're doing it right now.<eos> Is the agent you're with a six-foot-one black guy?<eos> No.<eos> Why?<eos> Then whoever you're meeting with isn't who I sent to bring in Bishop.
Sit your ass down.<eos> If the killer did give him this, everything down to the glue used to seal the envelope is evidence.<eos> I'm gonna try and preserve as much as I can.<eos> "This is the Zodiac speaking "to the two men in the parked Sedan.<eos> "You may be watching me, but just know that "I am watching you.
- I don't know what you're...<eos> - Oh, callous on your gun hand.<eos> The way Deltas were trained to reload.<eos> So let's try this again.<eos> You want to tell us who you really are?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, n...<eos> Well, this is disappointing.<eos> - Matty...<eos> - We can explain.<eos> I expected you two to go pawing through my past weeks ago to find this file.
You planted a fake video?<eos> You knew what we were up to this whole time?<eos> Very little goes on around here without me knowing about it, Bozer.<eos> And when agents get distracted, missions go badly.<eos> while you two have been busy violating the Espionage Act,
Newlyweds.<eos> Newlyweds.<eos> We're still working on the pet names.<eos> Please let us know as soon as you find him, and thank you so much for your help.<eos> Oh, you're very welcome, baby, and don't you worry.
They weren't kidding.<eos> This place could go down at any second.<eos> Hang on.<eos> I think this might be them.<eos> Okay, please tell me you're the ones
You won't have to worry about Jay much longer.<eos> So does this mean there's nothing out there?<eos> Maybe it's 'cause the bodies are cold?<eos> What the hell?<eos> Did you put them out there?
Then get my friends in.<eos> We were just trying to help.<eos> We can't bring 'em in now.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> And, you two, for the last time, stop acting like kids.
What is going on out there?<eos> Is anybody coming?<eos> The military?<eos> Police?<eos> We hoped you knew.
Can you move?<eos> Ish.<eos> Not too long.<eos> And I'm out.<eos> You know, so you two can make sweet love.
I mean, you would be.<eos> You started it.<eos> I understand you hate it, I do.<eos> I really, really do.<eos> However, while you may hate waiting for a weed dealer, the consequences of a world without the War on Drugs are far worse for you.
He was a very religious man, but his relationship with God was very...<eos> - personal and unique.<eos> - Well, I can see that.<eos> An open coffin?<eos> You Catholics are so macabre.
Sam has never fitted in here.<eos> Never really been part of what I... like to call... the "real community."<eos> And that's not to say...<eos> She's an actual gold digger but pound to a penny she's back to London with the real *** before you can say...<eos> Are you... talking about my mother?
Paul Jennings, Davy Crockett, sacagawea.<eos> Every one of them is an American hero, and they all worked right here in this room together.<eos> I always thought Daniel Boone was the one who wore the fur cap.<eos> Technically, they both did.<eos> Guys, you're missing the point.
Oh, "procuring" is the nicest way of saying he incinerated a security guard while demonically trashing a storage room.<eos> That guard is officially a missing person.<eos> It gives us grounds to question Dreyfuss.<eos> Very good. I should like an opportunity to get a better measure of the man.<eos> Whilst agent Thomas and I have a chat with Mr. Dreyfuss, perhaps you could divine what it was he sought from the Smithsonian.
Ah, that name...<eos> Just tickles me to no end.<eos> Please.<eos> Now, if I were to say I have any idea Wha...<eos> What in the world you're talking about, why would I discuss any of this with you?
Your men do not stand a chance against him.<eos> Hazards of the job.<eos> But no one...<eos> Forced these gentlemen to sign up to be security guards.<eos> Listen, you're...
I want my life back.<eos> You have the other pieces.<eos> I want them.<eos> Drop him!<eos> You both should want him dead.
"there is no place like home."<eos> You said you have some maps for me?<eos> Yes, indeed.<eos> This way, miss Alex.<eos> While you two get busy with the topography, I'll, uh, take a look around for info on ley line interference.
There. I think I can whip up a Faraday cage that'll filter out ley line energy and allow the scepter a clear signal.<eos> I just need a few things:<eos> Copper wire, a 4.5 volt battery, and then the motherboard from a trs-80.<eos> I've got a storage space near here that has all that gack and more-<eos> Very good. If you modify the Judas scepter, agent Thomas and I shall continue to search for information on the philosopher's stone.
People died playing, people that you really cared about.<eos> But we're not those people.<eos> We have our own reasons for being here, and we're old enough to make our own decisions.<eos> I was out of line.<eos> This is my issue, not yours, and I appreciate you calling me out on it.
During the middle ages, the barghest terrorized the black forest in Germany, preying on young girls, and spawned a host of legends, including the one that came to be known as "the tale of little red riding hood."<eos> As in, "what big teeth you have, grandma"?<eos> Very same.<eos> Now, many cultures have different variations on the tale.<eos> The one you know was popularized by Jacob and Wilhelm grimm.
There's a whole world out there.<eos> Yeah, I've seen it.<eos> And anything I want out there, I can get in here.<eos> Food, books, plants,<eos> - you name it.
Haircut's on the moon.<eos> - Guys, I'm gonna need more time.<eos> Ineedyoutocreate adistraction.<eos> everybody.<eos> - what the hell are you two playing at?
Hey, don't!<eos> Don't do this.<eos> - I am so sorry, Nathaniel.<eos> - No, no, you open that door, the explosive decompression will suck you out.<eos> - If I don't, you will all die.
Fan out to cover more ground.<eos> Stay on the coms and be careful.<eos> Yeah, Gideon said Tolkien was ill.<eos> We should search amongst the injured.<eos> Mr. Rory, Ms. Jiwe, you go look in triage.
And we all hope it will be.<eos> Knowing that it will be very difficult to hide it from the press.<eos> What are they going to do?<eos> How will they sanction it without being made public?<eos> We will do what you do as usual.
Er, hello. Erm...<eos> I... I shall be your caller tonight.<eos> Well...<eos> All right, then.<eos> You're all aware of the rules, I hope?
Please sign in.<eos> _<eos> So, what brings you here, Ms. Sinclair?<eos> Well, a friend of mine-- Terry-- had seen a psychiatrist a couple of years ago, and she was having some... problems.<eos> Issues, I-I guess is what you say.
There's probably a CVS or a Rite Aid selling ice cream... nearby because you're a good friend.<eos> You took a risk.<eos> And in fact, your relationship has only grown deeper, because now you know you have different senses of humor when it comes to certain types of stand-up comedy.<eos> What a stinging broth intimacy can be.<eos> That's who you are.
I'm 46 years-old.<eos> Of course I've fallen in love many times before.<eos> It was always over 100% my fault, uh, that it didn't work out, 'cause you know how it is.<eos> You fall in love with someone.<eos> You tell them, uh, that you love them, and then you share with them what you think is the single most horrifying fact about yourself.
And it was so painful.<eos> It was... weird and... I will never go see stand-up comedy ever.<eos> Well, we apologize that you experienced that with our services.<eos> If there's any way we can win back your business, in fact, I'd love to get your e-mail address and your birthday and set you up with 20 free tickets to a comedy show!<eos> As it turns out, for the most part, as you all know, comedy tickets are... free.
I can't, there's something more, more bigger than myself, and I just, I just can't,<eos> And, um...<eos> But then I remember there's this game that we used to play when we were kids, and it's called One Big Blob.<eos> What happens:<eos> I'm it, you run away from me, frightened, afraid.
No, that was addressed to "Richard Hendricks and company."<eos> Company, of which I am a part.<eos> You're not seriously thinking of going to Tibet? You're broke.<eos> How the fuck are you gonna pay for that?<eos> That's where you come in, my great friends.
W-we did it.<eos> You... hypocrites.<eos> You fucking hypocrites.<eos> When I wouldn't use the fake users, you called me a pussy. When I wouldn't lie on the stand, you called me a pussy.<eos> But now, when I'm actually doing what you've been wanting me to do, you quit?
You... hypocrites.<eos> You fucking hypocrites.<eos> When I wouldn't use the fake users, you called me a pussy. When I wouldn't lie on the stand, you called me a pussy.<eos> But now, when I'm actually doing what you've been wanting me to do, you quit?<eos> You're the pussies. You are the pussies.
I see you.<eos> You know, I've given my heart to this community, and I can't help but feel a little bit hurt that you're pushing me to decide, but, you know...<eos> I have atoned for my sins.<eos> And I have a life that is so much bigger than Bailey Downs.<eos> I am part of a sisterhood that you couldn't even begin to understand.
Our losing Steve continues to be felt, doesn't it?<eos> There have been growing pains.<eos> We've all felt them.<eos> And that's why we're so thankful to Bill for coming out to show his support.<eos> We... can't let Richard's misstep, his, inexplicable lapse in judgment, his betrayal... take away from all the progress that, you are... you all are making here. Mmhmm.
It's always an uphill battle when you take on "big business," but we took on a fight no one else was brave enough to.<eos> And Hawk even got thrown in handcuffs.<eos> I tell you, honestly, I... I couldn't be more proud of... of who we are, all of us, where we are.<eos> We are out thereYou.<eos> You are out there serving The Light, building The Garden, right now, today!
Cap'n... is that really you?<eos> Eh, last time I looked in the mirror...<eos> whenever that was.<eos> How are you so young?<eos> All this time... I thought you'd left me.
I thought I was abandoned.<eos> Nobody was abandoned...<eos> as you can see for yourself.<eos> What's the last thing you remember before we before YOU thought we'd left you?<eos> You were beaming me back to the Enterprise and for a moment, everything was transparent.
I have no idea... what she's talking about.<eos> Hey, you!<eos> Yes?<eos> Just now, you said you did something to keep the Safeguard from invading, right?<eos> Does that mean you set up this perimeter?
Tae!<eos> Thank goodness.<eos> Man, you're so reckless.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Are you all okay? You're not hurt?
Good morning, Canyon Park High School.<eos> I'm Ashley Foster, CPTV.<eos> Just want to say hello to all the new freshmen in the building.<eos> Welcome aboard.<eos> I know locker combinations can be tricky, but you'll make it through just like I did.
When the immensity of World War II comes in, he is given to a single sentiment:<eos> Why we fight.<eos> [man] From millions of feet of film confiscated from the enemy or donated by American film companies, these men are preparing pictures to set the war record straight and to counteract enemy propaganda.<eos> [second male voiceover] Scream you're abused, shout you're oppressed.<eos> The world's wrong, you're right.
And they gathered around them a large group of cameramen and soundmen to make the landing.<eos> That means you know you're going to sacrifice some of those men.<eos> There was no protected place from which to film the invasion of Normandy.<eos> You are about to embark upon the great crusade toward which we have striven these many months.<eos> In company with our brave allies and brothers in arms on other fronts, you will bring about the destruction of the German war machine.
Teresa.<eos> With great respect, we'll take the ton.<eos> You have a Judas among you.<eos> Okay, I will consider your request. But first, atonement is required.<eos> See, you have spilled the blood of my people when you were trying to escape. So a blood sacrifice is demanded.
We didn't have a choice.<eos> We could have thought of something else in those three days.<eos> One that doesn't end up with us dead.<eos> Wouldn't have made a difference.<eos> You had to make a big move. All your suppliers were burned.
I guess I'll just itch and be in pain.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Okay. We about done here, kids?<eos> No, wait, roger, don't give up on judy.<eos> We may have made a mess of a fake religion, But you two sea cucumbers took it in. And maybe pooped out love.
I love her.<eos> She gets me.<eos> Just like I get you, Adam.<eos> This doesn't seem fair.<eos> So how did you two meet?
She gets me.<eos> Just like I get you, Adam.<eos> This doesn't seem fair.<eos> So how did you two meet?<eos> Like, what place are you two people both going?
Lowell made me this little house out of twigs that he wove together to represent the home we would live in someday.<eos> And that sealed the deal.<eos> L.L.W. Ladies love weaving.<eos> So that's our story.<eos> How did you two meet?
That's super accurate.<eos> - One last time, never touch the goo.<eos> At least, we injured something out there.<eos> I needed the creature's body. Living, dead,<eos> I don't give a shit. Because until we collect every last supernatural entity that you let in the Triangle, I am stuck in this "living anus" of a town.
It'll be impossible to tell friend from foe until it's too late, so be careful.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Sorry. Do you know who's in charge here?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Curt Meyer, EPA, and you are?
Um, are we supposed to like it?<eos> I mean, are Easter egg hunts for kids?<eos> We thought they were for grown-ups.<eos> Well, then why do you kids do it then if you hate it so much?<eos> Because it seems like it makes you happy, and even though it makes us unhappy, we do it and we hate it.
What are they doing?<eos> I...don't know.<eos> Well, I don't like it.<eos> Look.<eos> You have chosen this path.
All right?<eos> Take this, grab a cab, take yourself home.<eos> I'm doing you a favor.<eos> I promise.<eos> You girls look lonely.
We had our girlfriend's bachelorette party.<eos> Cheers to being single.<eos> What's up?<eos> Last call!<eos> If you two are still at the bar, I'm guessing that you don't want the night to end.
Eli, do you know where your foster family could be?<eos> Your brothers and sisters.<eos> Your foster mom, Carol.<eos> They could be in danger, so if you know where they are, you need to tell us.<eos> How do I know you're not with those people?
How is that relevant to this investigation?<eos> You're an outlier, Jane.<eos> You were never trained by the FBI.<eos> You're barely vetted.<eos> I'm trying to understand how you're allowed in the field at all, but if you two were an item...
If you spend your life running from this, it's gonna eat you alive.<eos> Eli's phone call worked.<eos> Dr. "Scrazzy," "Scrizzy"...<eos> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> - You get it.
We're here.<eos> Roman, you're unarmed, so you have to stay close to us, understand?<eos> - Okay.<eos> - All right, let's go.<eos> Al, you two cover the back.
We found Mr Byrden's phone.<eos> He called you four times on Thursday.<eos> You may have been the last person to speak with him.<eos> I haven't said anything to his wife, all right?<eos> Er... I-I understand you were, um... you were friends with Mr Byrden?
I asked that crowd when we was in Denver, "Is the word 'pussy' offensive?"<eos> And the whole crowd said no, except for two people.<eos> One was a woman in the front, older than me, maybe around my age.<eos> Definitely a feminist.<eos> You know what I mean.
That doesn't make sense.<eos> Seriously.<eos> If I put on an argyle sweater, and I'm like, "Hey, everybody, I feel like a white guy in this sweater, and I want some goddamn respect and a bank loan,"<eos> You don't give a fuck how I feel.<eos> Why should I give a fuck how you feel?
Maybe you should give it to my daughter so she'll know not to stay out all night with that German pervert you sold her on.<eos> You are gonna get off my back at some point, aren't you?<eos> You need to understand something:<eos> all this is mine.<eos> You... are all mine.
There's no going back.<eos> That's the point.<eos> Hello.<eos> My name is Major General Ellen Briggs, but you can call me Shepherd.<eos> I am responsible for today's attacks on American soil... and so are you.
This is Ruzek.<eos> - Chicago PD.<eos> - Hey.<eos> My dad told me not to talk to you guys.<eos> Is that who you're calling right now?
- We can't.<eos> Forget the DNR.<eos> I know her, I know what she wants.<eos> Okay?<eos> You're doctors.
51, let's get a line in there.<eos> Quick trigger on this one.<eos> My gut is saying four minutes.<eos> All right, squad.<eos> You're with me.
The idea would be to combine it with traditional therapy with the hope of ultimately weaning him off the medication.<eos> No, no way.<eos> Elliot could very well be on the verge of acting out on some very disturbing impulses, including rape.<eos> He would never do anything like that.<eos> You people are sick.
- Food?<eos> - Come and get...<eos> Hi, you must be those wonderful neighbors the Croods told us about.<eos> Yep, that Amber.<eos> - Who are you people?
- [Lerk] Have you tried digging?<eos> - Don't try digging.<eos> - Oh, no!<eos> The Broods, uh, are heading this way.<eos> You can't hear them, but, um, they are.
Sure, today was a bit rough, but there's nothing the Croods can't overcome all by themselves.<eos> [gasps] The Broods are here!<eos> - [panting] It's those guys from before whose names I forgot!<eos> That's right, and no more nice Broods.<eos> This time, you're dinner.
We'll drink when we actually launch a gravity tractor with a fullsized EmDrive.<eos> Darius, if we could just stay put, I mean, we could be halfway through the calculations for the fullscale model by now.<eos> Someone here hacked the IO Probe and killed Lazlo to cover their tracks.<eos> The EmDrive is no longer safe at Tanz.<eos> Neither are you.
I can smell it, can't you? I sure can.
There's no take.<eos> In that case, I want 50 percent.<eos> We're doing this for queen and country. That's it.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll take the country and you can have the queen.
No, no trouble, Marquis Nicollo.<eos> It's just the girl here says she's the granddaughter of... Queen Uberta.<eos> They, uh, would like to speak with the king.<eos> I am Marquis Nicollo.<eos> And you are?
There's no need to ask questions, buddy.<eos> There's enough money for you and your boss.<eos> The boss was very clear, Chapo.<eos> Put the guns down!<eos> Otherwise, you'll be the first one to die.
Don't move!<eos> What's up, Peter?<eos> You're getting into trouble, man.<eos> An American cannot arrest people in Mexico.<eos> And you shouldn't kill a DEA agent, but you did it.
I mean, Captain Holt would wield that like a hammer and crush the guy.<eos> I don't want to start a whole hullaballoo, all right?<eos> I mean, I think I just need to sit down with the guy and have a direct conversation, just to make sure he doesn't ever do anything like this again.<eos> - That makes sense.<eos> - You think you two can handle watching the kids while I meet with Officer Maldack?
_<eos> Hey, Chris.<eos> Where are you off to?<eos> Oh, Isabella's coming by, and we're gonna take the kids to the park.<eos> Wow, you two are spending a lot of time together.
Forest fire is super exciting.<eos> Should be up front, okay?<eos> Number eight?<eos> Three minutes ahead of schedule!<eos> Well, you're either Team Scorpion, or the strangest cowboys I've ever seen.
Uh...<eos> Thank you, Bonnie.<eos> I can't help thinking that you and Christy coming into my life... maybe it wasn't a coincidence.<eos> Maybe there's a reason for it.<eos> Boy, this is hard to say, but I guess you're probably the best people to say it to.
I mean, look at me.<eos> I know what you're doing.<eos> You are trying to turn me into a grandma.<eos> Well, I'm-I'm sure you've had some fun, too, right?<eos> Did you, uh... did you take him to the park?
It's amazing.<eos> You are... amazing.<eos> Some of us dug, you know.<eos> And designed the pump.<eos> Well, I am sure you all worked up an appetite.
We are on our honeymoon.<eos> That was meant for our alone time.<eos> You want alone time?<eos> You got it.<eos> If, in addition to this journal, you've found a small skeleton in an elf costume, you now know why.
How'd your raft project turn out?<eos> All wet?<eos> It didn't work with us, why are you using it on them?<eos> That's really clever.<eos> You three finding that the, uh. magnet idea isn't as attractive as you thought it might be?
I'm a fucking woman!<eos> Don't touch me, Dad."<eos> Girls at 18 don't give a shit.<eos> They're ready for the world.<eos> And you know what I'm talking about.
And since I own it, take your little dick outside.<eos> "This is my lotion."<eos> He's gonna get caught.<eos> Because boys are sloppy with their work.<eos> They're sloppy with their work, and you know what I'm talking about.
No...<eos> The closer we get to the hole, the more inevitable it becomes.<eos> Damn it!<eos> This is driving me crazy!<eos> Did you follow the wall here, too?
This is driving me crazy!<eos> Did you follow the wall here, too?<eos> Yeah. Where did you find the hole?<eos> We didn't find anything to the west.<eos> Didn't you find it your way?
I mean, that's humans' job!<eos> Repeal the stupid new laws!<eos> Yes. Repeal the dog-- and child labor-- laws!<eos> Fine, just the dog ones.<eos> I say "status," you say...
- She doesn't like my eyes!<eos> - Stop it.<eos> - I know that's you.<eos> Hey, look, there's Gretchen.<eos> What do you know, she is doing hair.
I'll be your server.<eos> Let's get you started with those cinnamon buns you ordered.<eos> Cinnamon buns?<eos> We didn't order these.<eos> You didn't order them, huh? Uh-oh.
Uh, yeah, yeah, do that.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Let's give Mom a real show.<eos> She deserves a good Mother's Day present.<eos> Also, will you go before me?
Julie?<eos> Hi, Father.<eos> It's good to see you.<eos> I heard you and Bob Lee were caught up in that Frankfurt attack.<eos> You all have been in my prayers.
Children, Peter.<eos> Little girls.<eos> Do you know who I am?<eos> I said, do you know who I am?<eos> There was a robbery. While you two were in the bathroom.
[grunting] Enough!<eos> We're not your best friends.<eos> We just hung out with you so you wouldn't give us a final.<eos> Oh, I knew that.<eos> I just pretended I didn't so you wouldn't give me a final.
Eroticism was your ruination.<eos> The dirty old geezer is down.<eos> Master Roshi sama!<eos> Master Roshi!<eos> You two take care of my students.
He's got to know a way to find this guy.<eos> Mr. Gerard, I'm Special Agent Julian Gale.<eos> This is Special Agent Ressler.<eos> Yes, Agent Ressler.<eos> W-Wait, you two know each other?
Thank you.<eos> What is it?<eos> It's Reddington's signed immunity deal with the Department of Justice.<eos> Let me get this straight. You think I'm going to jail?<eos> You two are smarter than that.
But where does it end?<eos> I don't get it.<eos> You were Wyatt's friend.<eos> What happened?<eos> I should have known you two had something to do with the curse.
I'm gonna take SBK down. And anybody who get in my way gonna get hurt.<eos> It's of the highest importance in the art of detection to be able to recognize, out of a number of facts, which are incidental and which are vital.<eos> In this case, the key to the whole matter can be looked for in the scrap of paper in the dead man's hand.<eos> That little "12" in the corner matches the numbers in your checkbook.<eos> You wrote that.
But I didn't take that picture.<eos> He put that up online.<eos> That's the only way I get to see them anymore.<eos> I'm telling you.<eos> I don't know that man any better than you do.
What are you thinking?<eos> Tijuana's the best place to cross the border.<eos> And I'm the best man for the job.<eos> Let's be partners.<eos> You open your territory for me, and I do the crossing.
Thanks, boss. Close the doors.<eos> Now you'll see, Don Cheto.<eos> Well done, bud.<eos> Tough blow for the Avenda√±os.<eos> You say the word, I'll get my hands dirty.
It's a new thing. It's casual.<eos> My DNA test.<eos> You can't unsee the result.<eos> I'm not a child, Nicole.<eos> I should've known you two had something to do with the curse.
Kind of weird.<eos> A spa, OK?<eos> Massages, facials, those type of things.<eos> Also, 30 percent off all services on Wednesdays.<eos> You two have done a lot for me.
That's not good.<eos> I'm friends with the Avenda√±os.<eos> You can be their friend all you want, but you also respect codes.<eos> That's why we called you.<eos> If you need a middleman,
- And he has to pay.<eos> - War kills business.<eos> I won't be a part of that.<eos> Not on your side, not on theirs.<eos> If you want to negotiate, give me a call.
I think we should go, Ram√≥n.<eos> So soon?<eos> No way, man, it's your birthday!<eos> I'm leaving.<eos> If you want to stay, go ahead.
- My family is already dead.<eos> But Benjam√≠n and Ram√≥n are still alive.<eos> This isn't over, G√ºerito.<eos> I swear.<eos> [bells clanging] [archbishop] And you, as parents, have the moral obligation to teach your kids good values.
I wish I could say I didn't know it was just a matter of time.<eos> Tucker's out of his tree.<eos> He must have roofied<eos> - the Pinot Grigio.<eos> - So you two don't happen to know a couple of bitches who like to get their Halloween on in creepy, black dresses?
Oh, yes!<eos> - Jonas, this was great, but you have customers, we should... we should go.<eos> Are we having a good time?<eos> Yeah, we are, which is why we're gonna need a few more of those peppermint shots. Because it's like drinking Christmas.<eos> - You redheads are wild. - Yeah.
Uh, it was... it was a great speech.<eos> No, they branded me.<eos> The five circles, each indicate a point on the five-sided star.<eos> The U.S. Marshals' badge.<eos> - You are all unusually close.
And I got her a new scratching post.<eos> Hey, hey. Ahh.<eos> Chin up.<eos> Officer Haught's the strongest deputy I've ever had.<eos> Look, I know that you two are, um... you're, uh... but, you know, procedure says I had to call Nicole's next of kin.
The point is, the child must be protected.<eos> So what, you care about the Earps all of a sudden?<eos> I care about not getting cremated anytime soon.<eos> We can't beat the Widows.<eos> But there's a chance you all might be able to, with the right weapon.
So what, you care about the Earps all of a sudden?<eos> I care about not getting cremated anytime soon.<eos> We can't beat the Widows.<eos> But there's a chance you all might be able to, with the right weapon.<eos> You mean the one you took from us?
Like, it's a pretty good...<eos> If you have a job where you go to work - like Grade 3 - you go to work, and you're 50 times bigger than everybody else that you work with...<eos> That's a pretty good job.<eos> Plus, they do all the work.<eos> You do nothing.
"Anyway, this is the complete opposite."<eos> "So uh..." we would be glad to send you some brochures. "It's uh..."<eos> "It's a picture of you with no shelter."<eos> You know, I'm trying to be a better person.<eos> I don't know if you're religious or not.
- Like I said, whatever you throw at us, we'll throw it right the hell back.<eos> - With what manpower?<eos> You wanna pick a fight with a little regional law firm to flex your muscles, go ahead.<eos> But we're five times your size.<eos> This is a fight you started.
I... I ran around the yard and, and...<eos> I was so happy.<eos> I called the number on the anonymous letter from a phone booth because I was afraid to call from my house.<eos> Teresa called with an edge, you know.<eos> Like, "Why do you wanna talk to me and who the hell are you?
Filled with vampire clowns.<eos> What about the week before that, when I was like,<eos> "Hey, guys, let's go to the zoo."<eos> Creepy, abandoned, and there was a giant, zombie polar bear.<eos> Face it, you two, you just don't like to have fun like other people like to have fun.
In all the chaos, they and the treasure disappeared.<eos> Never to be seen again.<eos> There they are, Officers, arrest them.<eos> Sheriff, what's this about?<eos> Mr. Monkfish is alleging that you two are responsible for that pirate attack earlier.
If you don't mind, we'd like to abandon ship.<eos> Out of consideration for all our other guests,<eos> - I can't lower the gangplank...<eos> - What other guests?<eos> ...for you to leave until after the tour.
We're competing in the Bingo Bash Limbo Contest.<eos> How can you two be thinking about a limbo contest?<eos> People are missing!<eos> Yeah, like, how low can you go?<eos> Well, you two are just jealous that Velma and I are better at having fun than you.
Jinkies!<eos> Guys!<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - Aye!<eos> You're the ones everyone follows.
Guys!<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - Aye!<eos> You're the ones everyone follows.<eos> And you're the ones we're gonna stop.
I'm gonna say...<eos> Like, I would call that a relief laugh.<eos> Or, like, a release laugh.<eos> I know that I'm your show.<eos> But you have to understand, like, you're my show.
If I was that kid, I'd be like, "We have to stop them."<eos> And I'd be outside there protesting.<eos> So, I went outside, and I just wanted to say hi and show a warm, friendly face to baby murderer.<eos> And I said, uh, "Hey, hi. Isn't it great...?<eos> I just wanna say, isn't it great that we live in a country where I can put on this show because it's something that I believe in, and you can protest this show because of what you believe in,
How clever is that?<eos> I don't know if there's God.<eos> I mean, I cannot imagine there's God.<eos> But I don't know.<eos> Neither do you, you know?
I'm sorry.<eos> Now, we talk.<eos> About six months ago, some school children in Chelyabinsk came across this unusual rock.<eos> It looks like a piece of my tech fused to some sort of rock.<eos> By the time we pieced together what happened, we had bigger fish to fry, as you say.
Mr Butterworth, Annie.<eos> How about...<eos> Annie, if I pull your teeth now, rather than be in my debt, how about you offer Mr Butterworth here some trade, so to speak, and Mr Butterworth, you and I could consider that treat as some form of down payment?<eos> Fair dos. Do I get my pipe sucked before you smash her teeth out?<eos> I'll let you two fix the details.
We did set fire to him earlier.<eos> No-one said the journey would be easy.<eos> But what you're doing is extraordinary.<eos> We ARE great men.<eos> You are.
If we modify your star, you'll see your world in a whole new way.<eos> And... based on what we've just witnessed I'm not sure you're ready for it.<eos> Must we justify our actions to you?<eos> Are we obliged to meet some arbitrary moral standard set by Starfleet in order to receive your help?<eos> No. But killing defenseless people seems to... contradict the moral standard you've set for yourselves.
Captain, commence the decontamination sweep of Hyalinus!<eos> About that... I'm afraid we won't have the time.<eos> The Enterprise has been called away to urgent business on Daran Five.<eos> You would let us all die?<eos> As it turns out, our scans indicate that the Abicians have the decontamination technology that you require.
Has it ever occurred to you that their civilization could be suffering the same fate as yours?<eos> Given the Abicians' proximity to your sun, they experienced the radiation's ill effects generations before Hyalinus.<eos> Illness, food shortage...<eos> It is no wonder their world has fallen into chaos and war.<eos> They are what you would become.
And who says there has to be one?<eos> There doesn't have to be one, but...<eos> Harvey, first of all, you may be underestimating her.<eos> - I mean, Donna's a big girl. - Paula...<eos> And second of all, if I'm wrong and you're not underestimating her, then you're only gonna cause both of you a lot more trouble down the road when she finds out.
"Gold Tower Hotel<eos> Tomorrow, 8:00 p.m. Francisco."<eos> And I just remembered the Gospel according to Matthew where He says:<eos> "Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake.<eos> Blessed are you when men revile you and persecute you.
Don Sol, I have another urgent task for you.<eos> Conrado Sol.<eos> - Nice to meet you, sir...<eos> - This is a circus, Mr. Sol.<eos> Guzm√°n Loera has not been though trial yet, and you want to leave him in this prison.
Your family.<eos> If you ever mention one of those names, your two wives and your children will suffer the consequences.<eos> And that's not all.<eos> In your statement to the Public Prosecutor's Office, you'll make clear that the cardinal died as a consequence of the crossfire between you and the Avenda√±os.<eos> I think you are the ones that should be in prison.
What's your name?<eos> Conrado.<eos> Listen, Conrado.<eos> I don't want to get in trouble.<eos> I don't want you to get in trouble.
I...<eos> I mean, I'm going...<eos> I was going. I am.<eos> I will.<eos> Have you two been having trouble?
Maybe you can just tell me why you're here.<eos> Speakers live anywhere they deem right.<eos> You must know that.<eos> I know Speakers are nomadic tribes.<eos> You seem to have been here a while.
There's someone wriggling with pleasure in his coffin right now thinking of people like your girl walking into the cyclops he left down there.<eos> Or perhaps there is something down there so important that it must be guarded by monsters.<eos> Your Messiah isn't down there.<eos> And what makes you so sure?<eos> You Speakers carry information down through the generations.
To all intents and purposes, I will be the church.<eos> Trevor!<eos> Join us.<eos> Sure.<eos> By the way, you're all going to die.
I don't think it's a Belmont thing, either.<eos> I don't care.<eos> You need to leave, and leave now.<eos> I don't think we can leave these people, not in their time of need!<eos> These people believe you're causing their time of need!
Then perhaps it is right and proper that things from Hell should rise up to wipe us out.<eos> It's time for those of us who fight that war to stand up and be responsible, Trevor Belmont.<eos> You should leave now.<eos> No.<eos> You're leaving right now.
No.<eos> It's just a whim.<eos> What should I do for you?<eos> Put together a private meeting with Nanaka Hiraki.<eos> If you meet that condition, I'll publish with you.
You guys are the best.<eos> Let's grab a Krypton kale smoothie after this.<eos> Bumblebee?<eos> Katana?<eos> What are you two doing here?
To look for Bumblebee and Katana.<eos> Good idea.<eos> Katana hasn't returned those nun chucks she borrowed from me, like, eight months ago and...<eos> Hey, wait for me!<eos> I told my boss that you two were good.
- What is it?<eos> - The Hero Ball Arena.<eos> Are you sure we came here?<eos> I guess so.<eos> What are you three doing back here?
Oh, man,<eos> - and clumsy. - I meant to do that.<eos> Soon, I'll use the mother box to circumvent the amethyst's safeguards, and with my army of mind-controlled Supers, I'll take my rightful place as the ruler of Gemworld.<eos> Not if we have anything to say about it.<eos> That's why you won't have anything to say, period.
Peace at the sake of freedom!<eos> -Slaves?<eos> Is this true?<eos> -Non-cogs are not slaves!<eos> You're the ones who spread chaos and destruction!
You just need to relax, all right?<eos> I hope by now we've demonstrated that we aren't blindly bluffing.<eos> This game's a real one.<eos> Each of you are deep inside it.<eos> You can choose to follow our directives, or not.
Thank you so much for being here... on this glorious day for British sport.<eos> You have entered a new era for business... just as we have embarked on a new era for sport.<eos> Today it is my honor... and privilege, to present to you... the 14 young men who are all candidates for the British Olympic Downhill Team.<eos> Vying for your sponsorship and support... in achieving their dreams... to reach the 1988 Winter Games in Calgary.<eos> It's an opportunity that requires a new kind of athlete... and you deserve the best... in return.
Arrogance.<eos> Bad discipline.<eos> Drunkenness.<eos> Fornication.<eos> What you probably call "being a total loser."
But it doesn't help me.<eos> The British Olympic Association are trying to stop me, but I have to do this.<eos> This year 61 meters.<eos> Next year it'll be 71 meters. Then it's too late.<eos> I am going up that hill to jump and you are going to record my distance.
Will?<eos> Raise your hand.<eos> That stuff don't belong to you.<eos> Unhitch that wagon and head off down the road.<eos> Who are you?
You done yet?<eos> You, sir, are out of order.<eos> No, I'm not out of order, lieutenant.<eos> I understand this quite clearly.<eos> Y'all get your land back, then you go and work up some fancy law just last week that gets this boy back in the fields picking' cotton for ya, huh?
We'll wait.<eos> Might be a pretty long wait.<eos> Let me explain somethin' to ya.<eos> These men are here to vote.<eos> They mind dying a whole lot less than you do.
- What, contaminated?<eos> - How do you know that?<eos> - Because I told him.<eos> Dinner's ready.<eos> I see you two are getting along.
In ER, we're only saving lives.<eos> There's no fame, there's no, uh, CNN interviews.<eos> I guess I'll just have to stick with Nic.<eos> Whoa, wait a minute.<eos> You're not...
- Well done, Daddy.<eos> Someday, you and I will go hunting together.<eos> We're going to be late.<eos> Oh, God, it's this damn thing.<eos> You must be so pleased with yourselves. You, men. Making us wear these awful things.
Erin.<eos> Come on, we have finally succeeded at doing the thing that we have talked about since we were little kids.<eos> And you want to risk it all, what, for him?<eos> Who cares if you impress him?<eos> Golly, you two are something.
- Knock it off.<eos> No, I heard you and I see the hand gesture. What does...<eos> These gentlemen are on it.<eos> Let the government do their work.<eos> We're just worried that you all are drawing a lot of attention... - Exactly. - ...to yourselves.
- Here we go. - Here we go.<eos> Physics is the study of the movement of bodies in space, and it can unlock the mysteries of the universe.<eos> But it cannot answer the essential question of what is our purpose here.<eos> And, to me, the purpose of life is to love.<eos> And to love is what you have shown me.
It's awful cavalier of you to point fingers at poor, sweet, innocent Moby, considering six months ago he was in a shelter set to be put down.<eos> Now, I didn't save his life so he could suffer undeserved persecution.<eos> And you'd think as a medical student you'd be a little more familiar with basic anatomy.<eos> You know, no balls, no babies.<eos> Are you two, like...
Hurt mingled with shame were overwhelming me, but I told myself: you can do it.<eos> You can contain yourself.<eos> Listen, what kind of nonsense are you telling us?<eos> He is beating her, and she's containing herself.<eos> And you are just sitting here. Wide-eyed and open-mouthed.
I built 80% of the buildings in Seoul. - What? - I built them.<eos> You bastard!<eos> Asshole, I'll throw this at you!<eos> I'll throw this! This is a grenade!<eos> You know shit about a tyrant's end!
Senate Chief Maham!<eos> For 15 monsoons the people have suffered the consequences of your actions.<eos> Chiefs!<eos> To fight injustice is justice itself!<eos> You are silent, because you do not know the truth about Maham!
For 15 monsoons the people have suffered the consequences of your actions.<eos> Chiefs!<eos> To fight injustice is justice itself!<eos> You are silent, because you do not know the truth about Maham!<eos> You do not know the real reason why he was forced to leave Harappa.
You are alone, Maham!<eos> Completely alone.<eos> No!<eos> Do not be misled by him!<eos> I am still the Senate Chief and you work for me!
Or a pen and paper.<eos> Why am I even considering this lunatic notion?<eos> Because you want to drink your pints in a proper pub.<eos> Look, we all have concerns, but let's at least give it a go.<eos> I brought some sample material for you to read, courtesy of Jen.
Well, close shave.<eos> - Is she pissed?<eos> - Pissed off, I think.<eos> It's a bit of a strain doing these events.<eos> Look, you've all seemed to have got very chummy.
You know, take your kit off,<eos> - subject yourself...<eos> - I'm not taking...<eos> God, you don't know anything, do you?<eos> I mean, you wrote the bloody book, and now you're coming over here all sanctimonious.
Jen, what the...<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> We've come to sign up for the writers' group.<eos> It sounds like you're doing some jolly interesting and thought-provoking stuff.<eos> I wish you could see yourselves.
There was never gonna be any more money.<eos> We really didn't want the money.<eos> Honestly, Jen.<eos> I actually accept that.<eos> But you'd better accept that my lovely sister is the only one of you who comes out of this with any dignity.
Ahh... yes, a skeptic.<eos> I beg your pardon?<eos> I must ask that you put your full faith in me during the session.<eos> Negativity and doubt can easily taint the connection.<eos> I'll have faith if you help us find our daughter.
If it weren't for him, none of this would have happened. None of it!<eos> Stand down, Private. Do you copy?<eos> Stand down, Carlisle.<eos> You can rot in hell, Jones.<eos> You can all rot in hell.
No, Jack.<eos> It's too late for me now.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Damn it, Jack, look at me!<eos> You have to shut it down now or you will all die.
A little badass, this one, huh?<eos> This little badass<eos> - is Vigilante's sidekick.<eos> - Don't call me his fucking sidekick.<eos> Look, Barry says you all are who we need to get this done.
All right.<eos> I can't believe it!<eos> I just don't believe it!<eos> We're never gonna get a hold of that stupid lamp!<eos> I hope you weren't doing the lines better than I do.
Good.<eos> The United Nations are going to send more peacekeeping troops, so I need your assistance, General de Gaulle.<eos> And what will you give in return?<eos> It's in all our interests that the mining companies continue their operations.<eos> My old rival would have nationalized everything you own.
I looked, woo.<eos> But this is where you make your mark.<eos> This is where you stand out.<eos> Some will tell their children that they graduated from Greene, and that's huge.<eos> But you will tell your children that you created the first women's gymnastics team at Greene university.
But we stay one step ahead.<eos> That's the game.<eos> Good.<eos> That's what I wanted to hear.<eos> Well, you two enjoy your dinner, and... it's on me.
Where is our Bonnie Prince Charlie today?<eos> I am...<eos> Bonnie Prince Charlie.<eos> crowd: Yes.<eos> You are Bonnie Prince Charlie.
- You son of a bitch...<eos> - Stay where you are.<eos> You either some kind of genius, Mr. Holden, or you the luckiest dipshit in the solar system.<eos> Why did you invite us here?<eos> You two are the only witnesses to a series of catastrophic events.
Get himself tangled up in this mess?<eos> You're out of your ever-lovin' mind, you think you can trust that guy.<eos> Look, I only committed myself.<eos> Fred Johnson offered to crew me up.<eos> You guys'll be safe here on Tycho till all this blows over, then you can go back to your lives.
Look, I know we got off to kind of a rocky start, but we came through it okay.<eos> To a guy like me, that means something.<eos> Bein' in the trenches with people.<eos> Goin' through shit.<eos> So, what do you say, when we get to Eros or wherever it is you're going, we shake hands and forget all this ever happened.
I guess I'm just not that desperate.<eos> We all are.<eos> If we're being honest with ourselves.<eos> Let me ask you something.<eos> You guys are gonna get on this big ship, you're gonna ride out into the great beyond for 100 years.
It was a shock finding her like that.<eos> Miller, in here.<eos> Seal off this tenement.<eos> No one in or out without my say-so.<eos> Inspector Sematimba, CPM, what the hell are you doing here?
If it's talk about me, I'm right here.<eos> You have a problem, Gabe!<eos> Don't provoke him, please.<eos> Uh, if I may suggest something?<eos> If you three switch your baritone to a bassitone and then you transpose it up half a step, you'll still have a nice, clean three-part Harmony.
Miss.<eos> What are you people doing?<eos> We aren't harming you Miss.<eos> But taking care of you.<eos> You've got the wrong person.
Even Sasaki?<eos> Wasn't that your ex-wife?<eos> You left her just to marry a Japanese woman.<eos> The servants told me.<eos> I also heard that you two still sleep in the same bed.
And I was like, you know, "What's the difference, Mr. Chandler?<eos> The boat sinks in this weather, we're dead anyways."<eos> Yeah, I remember that.<eos> And then he was like...<eos> "The life jacket's to make it easier on the sharks when you go over."
Yeah, I'll say.<eos> Step to your right.<eos> Next.<eos> What are you looking at?<eos> You are waiting arraignment.
And you will be compensated for your generosity and boldness.<eos> But most importantly, because of what our advancements mean for humanity.<eos> Because we will prevail.<eos> It's time. Please.<eos> That is why I want you to be the first to see him... speak to him, to touch and feel.
And Naomi, having missed Marc, for the rest of her life, decided that she, too, would have herself cryonized.<eos> Of course, here at Prodigy, we couldn't let their story go unfinished. So, we're gonna do it.<eos> Naomi Keller will be the second human being ever resurrected.<eos> Don't worry, we won't be asking you to take out your wallets.<eos> You'll gladly hand them to us.
They're known as Er Bao and Shortie.<eos> They're Choi Dong Hen's men.<eos> - Find them!<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> You two couldn't even deal with an old man.
We just can't contact her father.<eos> You won't take care of her forever.<eos> No, we've had enough.<eos> We can't deal with her.<eos> But you're her relatives.
Just wait and see!<eos> Good to see you here!<eos> Boss!<eos> Kung Fu Panda is chasing me.<eos> You two kill him for me.
To impress women.<eos> Man's unrequited desire... to sleep with beautiful women is a linchpin of a thriving society.<eos> Have you put your linchpin in The Droid yet?<eos> - You know me.<eos> - So you two are... together?
No, baby.<eos> You're the only man here who doesn't need a dose at all.<eos> Now can we get back to having the best fucking night ever?<eos> All right, I'm bringing it up.<eos> Hey, all right, you two fucking on the dance floor last night?
Oh, I look so good.<eos> Giving out blowjobs like they're handshakes.<eos> Stupid cunt.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> You cunts are what's wrong with the world!
Lupe, I have put your kids through college.<eos> - What are you saying?<eos> Let's go!<eos> - Let me just go sterilize.<eos> You know, the one thing your people have is not one wrinkle on that colored skin of yours.
Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, you're not listening to me,<eos> - there's something happening in this town...<eos> - Sir, shut the fuck up!<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - God, you people are so fucking boring!
No more pretending, no more lies. We can be free.<eos> Why would you wanna leave paradise?<eos> Danny, we're your friends!<eos> Why are you doing this to us?<eos> Oh, wait, you're my friends, is that why you guys always treat me like a dickless clown?
This place...<eos> This place is magical!<eos> I am the Neo here!<eos> Can't you see?<eos> You don't know me.
Can't you see?<eos> You don't know me.<eos> You guys know the old me.<eos> The scared me.<eos> The me who gave a fuck what you thought!
Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> - No.<eos> We can't do it alone.<eos> If something goes wrong and you're to blame...
I'll change to a blue suit.<eos> We've got five and a half hours to get everything in place, those with the largest distance to cover, should go now.<eos> We need a helicopter, in case we lose sight, or if he's got someone helping him.<eos> Will Carl and Assad be on the train?<eos> - No, you'll take one of the cars.
- Yes.<eos> We are gonna Purge today Purge today, Purge today<eos> We are gonna Purge today Burn this bitch down<eos> Fuck!<eos> Okay, you take the back, I'm gonna take the front.
- Well done, pike.<eos> -Frank pike.<eos> -Oh, my knight in shining armor.<eos> Well, I look forward to getting to know you more in the coming days.<eos> England can sleep soundly knowing that you're watching over her.
Discombobu...<eos> I know what it means, Wilson.<eos> So, you knew her at Oxford.<eos> I was her tutor for a while.<eos> But you two weren't...
Gather around.<eos> -Evening, miss winters.<eos> -Good evening.<eos> Now, listen, men.<eos> You all know, you can ask me...
Well, look who's here.<eos> Men who lost us the war.<eos> That's most unkind, Mr. Hodges.<eos> Who needs the enemy when we've got the home guard?<eos> You're a shambles, the lot of you.
I MEAN, IT'S ON PICO.<eos> DOESN'T REALLY MATTER.<eos> KELLY, IT'S THERE.<eos> SO HOW'S IT GOIN'?<eos> I MEAN, ARE YOU... ARE YOU GUYS STILL HOT FOR EACH OTHER?
DRAMATIC.<eos> - NANA.<eos> I HAVE A LITTLE SOMETHING FOR YOU.<eos> THIS IS CALLED SOMEDAY MONEY,<eos> AND I DON'T NEED THIS MONEY, BUT SOMEDAY YOU WILL.
- PLEASE. YES, YOU CAN.<eos> I HID IT FROM BERNARD,<eos> THAT G.D. SON OF A...<eos> WHEN I SEE HIM, I'M GONNA KICK HIS ASS TO THE CURB.<eos> THIS IS FOR YOU TO MAKE ME HAPPY AND TO GIVE ME THE PEACE I NEED.
We have to ask freshmen if we can teach now.<eos> They won't let Antonia come in.<eos> Great! I've had enough.<eos> - Respect different convictions!<eos> - You have none!
Oh, you mean, together?<eos> Yeah, we're not together.<eos> Ben and I are just friends.<eos> Oh, well, Chuck said you were a couple.<eos> Oh, I suppose I just assumed you were together.
Rell, Rell.<eos> Come on, bro.<eos> Fucking do it.<eos> Can't do it!<eos> And you have many more guns than I do.
I'm sorry, cariad. I'm putting my foot down.<eos> You're not taking her!<eos> Not to hospital, not to anywhere out of my sight.<eos> What are they going to do with her?<eos> Dump her in a corner, shut her in some side room like you have?
Chief, if you want to avoid an international incident, you give me my guys when I ask for them!<eos> Local faces need to resolve local conflicts, Tyrone.<eos> We're guests in this country.<eos> We're unwanted guests, Bob.<eos> We're spies, you're security guards.
He's my partner.<eos> So be nice.<eos> Can I sleep over it Jill's?<eos> Mnh-mnh, no sleepovers.<eos> You two have to stay here and watch out for one another and take good care of Charlie.
Okay, mom.<eos> Watch it, you.<eos> All right, go in that first tunnel.<eos> No, take what's-his-face.<eos> Yeah, you tow go-- no, if you two in there...
One man.<eos> It is intolerable!<eos> I'd rather be run through by a British bayonet and have my body buried in an unmarked grave than turn back after we have come this far!<eos> But I see now that I am betrayed by both friends and allies.<eos> You do what you must, but may God damn you to hell for it.
You didn't see anything going on with either one of 'em, did you?<eos> You live and die by your choices.<eos> This is Harlem's garden.<eos> That's what's happening here.<eos> You are the ones that are gonna keep this community...
Never.<eos> We have a lot of eyes on us, Misty.<eos> Can't take any chances.<eos> What's this based on?<eos> The night of the restaurant explosion and Crispus Attucks raid, you and your partner logged into the crime scene 40 minutes apart.
He should be dead.<eos> My skin is now tough... like armor.<eos> I think maybe what makes him stronger is also pushing the shrapnel deeper into his organs.<eos> Trust me, it is impossible to cut into his skin.<eos> Look, I don't know what it is that you think I can do for you.
She's a lawyer.<eos> Or she about to be.<eos> Well, if you haven't done anything wrong, you don't have any problem.<eos> I don't.<eos> But you've got about five problems, far as I can tell.
This stops now!<eos> Yes, it does. Yes, it does.<eos> Oh, it warms my heart to see you here this evening.<eos> Good to see you, too.<eos> My cousin, Cornell Stokes... was murdered right where you're standing, and it pains me to even be here.
Emails. Make sure you get emails and a head count.<eos> - Consider it done, ma'am.<eos> - Oh! I didn't know you got off work.<eos> Hey. How you doing?<eos> - Because you are here.
Ty caught a straggler.<eos> - Good.<eos> Anybody ain't us is a hostage.<eos> Make sure none of them look me in the eye.<eos> Lopes, Sugar, you're babysitting.
Cage, we have a mutual enemy, and the only way to bring him down is for us all to come together.<eos> There's no way I'm helping you.<eos> We came to offer you a truce.<eos> In exchange for helping you find Diamondback, you drop your beef with us.<eos> You both framed me for murder.
- Oh, finally.<eos> Hi.<eos> - Hi. - Many in?<eos> - Uh, no.<eos> No, you're the first.
- Is your family rich?<eos> - No.<eos> My wife has got cash, at the moment.<eos> - She has, she's got loads.<eos> - Your wife? Mm. She'll pay, then you'll release us, yeah?
Just don't mind me.<eos> Where does the rest of your family live?<eos> I never had any.<eos> Well, you didn't have anyone?<eos> I grew up in a... ..what do you call it?
Grandpa?<eos> It's okay.<eos> I've got you.<eos> There's got to be another way.<eos> You two have your destiny.
After tomorrow Heydrich will be gone.<eos> I agree with Josef.<eos> I don't think this is a direct command.<eos> I believe its purpose is to calm the nerves in Jindra.<eos> I know you all doubt me.
As everyone knows, tonight is the Purge.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - And you know why we gotta purge.<eos> First of all... for all of you who keep thieving... killing, selling drugs that we can '2' tax... for all you who ain't paying your child support... but just bought a brand-new Xbox and some Jordans.<eos> I'm talking to bankers making a cool million... each time you sneeze... while the public can't afford to pay the mortgages... that you sold them.
So tonight, as Americans... we PUTQe-<eos> Hey, if you ain't done nothing wrong... you got nothing to worry about.<eos> Purge ain't about you.<eos> It's about the rest of you.<eos> And you know who you are.
- Hello, Blacks.<eos> - Just got one more thing for you.<eos> - What?<eos> - What?<eos> As the... I guess I'm the new president of the Home Owner's Association. Let me just say you have no business in this neighborhood.
Be with you in a second, sir.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hi, Mama.<eos> Hi, baby.<eos> What are you two doing here?
They'll indict themselves.<eos> - Hey, Drake, how you doing?<eos> - Hi, Drake. Walt, this is Tucker and Trout.<eos> This is Walt.<eos> This is the guy whose toolbox you stole.
I just want you and your family to be on the right side of it.<eos> And when I tell you to piss off?<eos> - Why don't you give us a minute, sweetie?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You have committed crimes that must be punished in accordance with Occupational Law.
You're one of them, aren't you?<eos> You're not real.<eos> I have to go now.<eos> Sun's almost down.<eos> You should, too.
I-I have to warn her.<eos> Warn who?<eos> Dolores.<eos> The things they do to her.<eos> The things you do to her.
Really?<eos> Anyway, it wouldn't have worked out.<eos> He was far too wrapped up in himself.<eos> I needed something else.<eos> Now, how did you two end up together?
This old thing?<eos> I'm thinking you want us to look into the baker.<eos> No!<eos> Leave that to the coroner.<eos> You two just figure out why he's dead.
Which one's Stephens?<eos> Eric Stephens?<eos> L.A.P.D.<eos> Oh, please, call me Short-game.<eos> And you are...?
- Okay. You hold on.<eos> Who are you? - Get the fuck away from me.<eos> Whoa, whoa, just slow down.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Who are you?
Really?<eos> How's that goin' so far?<eos> Good night, baby.<eos> If I'm not happy in a particular situation,<eos> I need to ask myself, and you might want to ask yourself,
What are you doing to beat this heat?<eos> Speaking of hot, hot, hot!<eos> Janet's bring the heat with the number one single in the country.<eos> I miss it so much when I don't hear it.<eos> I know you do, too.
Your kid doesn't need you to have a career.<eos> Really?<eos> What does she need?<eos> For you to basically do what you've been doing tonight with us.<eos> Okay, I think you and I have very different philosophies on how to raise kids.
Who's Ari?<eos> -Ari Heinonen, my accountant.<eos> He's got a bigger car and not so many guns.<eos> She'll be back.<eos> You two are like magnets.
1.4 doesn't even cover my monthly nut, let alone drive expansion.<eos> - Ray, those are the terms.<eos> - It's not good enough.<eos> - It's almost triple our cut.<eos> - You should be getting more too then, shouldn't you?
It's its own separate company.<eos> Which puts it outside your purview.<eos> - Anything relating to McDonald's is within our purview.<eos> - Let me explain something to you, Dick.<eos> You boys have full say over what goes on inside the restaurants.
- And now I do.<eos> - You don't "have" it.<eos> - You sure about that?<eos> Bye, Dick.<eos> As per the terms of your agreement, while you are entitled to maintain ownership of this location, you no longer have the right to call it McDonald's, McDonald or any such variation so as to confuse or infringe upon the McDonald's trademark which is now the exclusive intellectual property of Mr. Raymond A. Kroc.
Just to give us, um, something to talk about.<eos> - And it's not admissible.<eos> - I mean, every time...<eos> What did they think was gonna happen?<eos> You ask me that.
You're not to talk to the other hotel guests at any time, for any reason.<eos> Once in the hotel, you will not be permitted to leave your floor.<eos> You're not allowed in another juror's room for any reason.<eos> Deputies will be on duty in the halls and elsewhere to supervise you at all times.<eos> Do you and each of you understand and agree that you will well and truly try the cause now pending before this court and a true verdict render according only to the evidence presented to you and to the instructions of the court, so help you God?
Good morning.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, we are coming close to the end, I promise.<eos> And I want you all to know how much I appreciate what you're doing here...<eos> For justice...<eos> And to thank you all from the bottom of my heart for the incredible sacrifices that you've made.
So you have a lying Mark Fuhrman, the personification of evil, who found the gloves.<eos> But don't be fooled.<eos> This isn't just one officer.<eos> Mark Fuhrman represents the entire... LAPD.<eos> Now, you may not know this, but you are... empowered.
That is genocide.<eos> That man speaks like Adolf Hitler.<eos> Now, since you can't trust the man and you don't trust the People, is it any wonder, in the defining moment in this trial, when they asked O.J. Simpson to try on the glove and the glove didn't fit.<eos> It didn't fit because it wasn't his.<eos> If you don't stop this cover-up, who will?
A girl must decide if she wants to serve the Many-Faced God.<eos> A girl has decided.<eos> A servant does not ask questions. No! No!<eos> No! It was you.<eos> You made the white walkers.
He'll come for you.<eos> But he can't get in.<eos> He can now.<eos> His mark is on you.<eos> You must leave, all of you.
Sleep is the only way you'll heal.<eos> Trust me, if my soup didn't kill you, nothing will.<eos> Thing about Gatins, right, is he used to be pretty.<eos> I was a famous kisser.<eos> You lads know how to kiss proper?
More.<eos> Much more.<eos> You seem happy.<eos> I am happy.<eos> You should both be happy as well.
He gave a failed, drunk priest the power to bring him back for a reason.<eos> We are part of something larger than ourselves.<eos> Lots of horrible shit in this world gets done for something larger than ourselves.<eos> Cold winds are rising in the North.<eos> And you're going to go stop them?
If you had not been so arrogant, you could have returned to your homeland with a fleet of ships.<eos> Instead, you will flee Slaver's Bay on foot like the beggar queen you are.<eos> We are here to discuss terms of surrender, not to trade insults.<eos> The terms are simple.<eos> You and your foreign friends will abandon the Great Pyramid and the city of Meereen.
You're going to die tomorrow, Lord Bolton.<eos> Sleep well.<eos> She's a fine woman, your sister.<eos> I look forward to having her back in my bed.<eos> And you're all fine-looking men.
No one enters, no one leaves...<eos> Wait, do you hear that?<eos> No one enters.<eos> No one leaves.<eos> Who are you?
Okay, we need to get out of here now.<eos> She's right.<eos> She's always right, isn't she?<eos> What's going on?<eos> Well, when it comes to this quest, you two have made your choice.
Well, I don't really have the exact definition.<eos> I do know what it means, obviously, because I just used it.<eos> Well, thank you so much for calling.<eos> I am Dr. Greg Coulter and you are listening to the Love and Living Channel on Gravity Satellite Radio.<eos> You listen, we hear.
I accept.<eos> Wonderful.<eos> Very good.<eos> Yeah. Oh, sorry.<eos> 'Alright. You all have worked very hard.'
- I know.<eos> - I know. - So where are you staying at?<eos> - Just at a hotel down the street.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - You guys all staying in the house?
- My bestie from San Fran. - Hi, nice to meet you. - She's gonna be my maid of honor.<eos> - Yeah, yeah, how are you'?<eos> - I'm good, how are you?<eos> - Yeah, good, good, good.<eos> - So how do you...
You know how much I love to make sweet potato casserole.<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> - Makes me feel like he's here with us.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You're doing great.
See, Lester here, he's a real musician.<eos> You need to learn how to play a piano or a guitar or something.<eos> A kazoo, nigger. - (laughs)<eos> - Leave that boy alone.<eos> You feeling what I'm making, right?
The Socialists will support City Hall's motion.<eos> The French Party will vote against it.<eos> And we're not that old, Mr. Barr√®s.<eos> You're not the only one here who represents the younger generation.<eos> Obviously, you're just old men in young bodies, and everybody knows it.
You too: shirt off.<eos> Help him.<eos> What are those bruises?<eos> They're already here.<eos> You have fought.
This is what they will say.<eos> This is how they will challenge you.<eos> Respectfully, Sire.<eos> Then let the many voices of the motherland choose who should be Khan.<eos> Whom would you elect?
You see, these children...<eos> They have nice clothes, comfortable beds.<eos> They are like Dog.<eos> Everything comes very easy.<eos> But you... my great cats, eh?
Not now.<eos> - We will not do this.<eos> - Peder is right.<eos> - Harald is important.<eos> - And you will be less vulnerable.
- Harald is important.<eos> - And you will be less vulnerable.<eos> Both of you.<eos> - We need to separate.<eos> You two stay together.
- No...<eos> - Send me.<eos> - They requested the King in person.<eos> Alone.<eos> - They broke their own ceasefire, and you want to send my father straight into the lions' lair!
Brutally murdered.<eos> Pass. This place is awesome.<eos> You guys are gonna thrive out here, and I am not gonna have to worry about you hogging my shower anymore.<eos> And we don't have to worry about getting ringworm.<eos> You brought the ringworm.
You guys are gonna thrive out here, and I am not gonna have to worry about you hogging my shower anymore.<eos> And we don't have to worry about getting ringworm.<eos> You brought the ringworm.<eos> Yeah, and now your apartment is infested with it.<eos> Yeah. Don't worry, you'll be back to giving each other worms soon enough.
The corn syrup is full of vitamins.<eos> Hi, kids!<eos> It's Patty Simcox, the bad seed of Rydell.<eos> Hi!<eos> I just love the first day of school, don't you?
Zuko?<eos> You got to be kidding me. What is this?<eos> Halloween?<eos> How did you get a letterman's sweater.<eos> When you were out stealing hubcaps, I lettered in track.
- Debs?<eos> - For what?<eos> I--I want to light a candle for Bianca at the foot of the blessed.<eos> No.<eos> I hope someday you two have the precious gift of feeling what I felt for that beautiful young woman... [sobs] ...and then to have that love stolen cruelly from you by a pitiless God, and then maybe, just maybe,
Come on, you're gonna love it.<eos> [bell tolling]<eos> Jesus.<eos> Uh, excuse me.<eos> I'm--I'm late for work, and you all look like you haven't had gainful employment for decades, so if you don't mind, I'll just, um...
I want to check there are no complications.<eos> Why not?<eos> It's a simple request.<eos> Simple for you, but not for us.<eos> If the mother and baby die, you'll be responsible too.
Sisters...<eos> Mother...<eos> Listen to us for a minute.<eos> These orphans live on the streets.<eos> You could take them in.
Letting two kids rob you.<eos> You really don't deserve this money.<eos> What the hell you doing, you little freak?<eos> ! What the hell are you doing?<eos> You're both dead!
That would've been a real family reunion.<eos> So that's what this has been about?<eos> Delivering me to her?<eos> Well, when I saw her picture in your file, I figured you'd go after her, so I did some digging.<eos> Saw you two had some history and it all kind of... came together.
Oh, my God, is Dianne Wiest here?<eos> No, I've hired a trio of classical musicians to perform a Shostakovich cantata, originally written as an apology to a dear friend.<eos> Are you stealing kitchen supplies?<eos> Just let us have this stuff.<eos> You have so much, and we have so little.
What? No. I was gonna say hang posters.<eos> Terry, maybe go with them, make sure nobody gets killed.<eos> Or maybe I could join another group with a different kind of energy?<eos> Jake, what about me and Hitchcock?<eos> You two grab Cheddar's treats and put 'em in a bowl outside.
So we're supposed to come running to clean up your mess every time you snap your fat little fingers?<eos> Oh, no, no, I actually can't snap my fingers, they're always too wet.<eos> And I just thought, since it's your job...<eos> Oh, I see.<eos> You cops think you're too good to clean up after yourselves?
You, not so much.<eos> He complained about my singing, but...<eos> I'm guessing you think it's adorable.<eos> Sure.<eos> How long have you two been married?
Dana!<eos> Enough of this bullshit, let's go.<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey, you!<eos> I was thinking about killing you and throwing your body outside to use as a decoy, but then I realized, all this time you've been thinking it's you two against me.
I'm about to retire.<eos> I turned in the gun. I'll take the rap.<eos> We're all in this together.<eos> Madam, losing the perp is negligence.<eos> But you'll go to jail for perjury.
Mr. Finestra? Is there a problem with the document?<eos> American.<eos> I beg your pardon?<eos> My company's name is American Century.<eos> You dropped the American.
Okinawa.<eos> Pearl Harbor... despicable.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> It was awful.<eos> In any event, looks like you are all soon to be very wealthy men.
I've never seen anything like it.<eos> I mean... they almost made my stomach turn.<eos> Horrible.<eos> I don't like when we talk about competitors like this because that's not the way we do business.<eos> But let me just say, you're Germans, we're Americans, but we're people.
- Not a real dog.<eos> Yeah, don't bite into a real dog.<eos> Don't bite into a... woof-woof.<eos> Woof!<eos> OK, you two can fuck off tonight.
That's weird, I always thought he would've looked like<eos> Phil Donahue or someone like that. I always thought he'd be, like, a lion with, like, James Earl Jones' voice.<eos> Mm, that's cool.<eos> Hey, what did God say we should play?<eos> You play whatever you want.
Cursing you with consciousness.<eos> Gary. I'm just like you.<eos> A handyman trying to fix up a cosmic shack with a nail here and a lick of paint there.<eos> Knowing that the building really needs to be condemned.<eos> People say that I made you in my image, but the truth is, you made me in yours.
I'm his mom.<eos> I mean don't you need a man to raise a man?<eos> No.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> I mean, I think you're what's gonna work for him.
Our manager's gonna join. He just went to take a leak.<eos> You got a manager?<eos> Good, one less thing to figure out.<eos> Yeah, there he is.<eos> You two go back, right?
They didn't invite us.<eos> Wherever the ship takes you... you call Red Cross and claim refugee status.<eos> I've spoken to the captain.<eos> It will be 200 dollars per person.<eos> You can all afford it.
It's your choice whether you go or not.<eos> But 175,000 people are waiting for us in Jordan.<eos> And their only fault is... that they're Indians, but not our kin.<eos> I can't give you a reason... to risk your lives for them.<eos> It's best that you find one yourselves... that would save their lives.
Help!<eos> Please, no...<eos> Please, don't.<eos> Please.<eos> Drop your gun... and you all can live.
Good luck.<eos> Back in a few hours, promise.<eos> Gonna be all right?<eos> I may want to hang out without you, anyway.<eos> Maybe you two should go for a walk, eh?
When you guys call out sick, how do the floors get clean?<eos> You know, how... how do these children eat food?<eos> When we call in sick, the other guys just pick up the slack, man.<eos> It ain't that difficult to move these trays around.<eos> No, Dayshawn, look, what you do is very important here, okay?
There is a complex in the mountains Where it is likely to be.<eos> The problem is getting there.<eos> However, there is a blind spot.<eos> few know Get out of the valley alive.<eos> So, any of you Have you ever been there?
I'll protect you, Jay. And if you're staying ...<eos> I will not become A copper head.<eos> Chup√µes.<eos> All right, everybody.<eos> Looks like your friend is not coming. So you are the last hope
- Anyone second that?<eos> - London! All right, do we have any other nominations?<eos> No.<eos> All right, I guess we have our leader.<eos> Okay, then, I guess I'm thinking the same thing you all are thinking, probably.
Oh, yeah?<eos> Well, we'll see about that.<eos> I had hoped you would listen to reason.<eos> I really did. But you're forcing my hand.<eos> And if you continue with this foolishness, know that I will crush this strike and bury each and every one of you.
You two can't do it?<eos> Find someone who can!<eos> - You ain't our boss.<eos> - No, I ain't.<eos> But what do you think London's gonna do when he finds out you two ain't pulling your weight?
London ain't our boss neither.<eos> You're right.<eos> But he can tear you limb from limb with his bare hands.<eos> Now, get out of here.<eos> I don't want you two guarding the barn.
This is on us.<eos> That day, when that suit came, what did you tell them if they touch that old man?<eos> If Anderson gives the word, we'll be officially trespassing.<eos> They'll have grounds to call in the national guard.<eos> You're all just gonna sit here and wait for whatever they have to bring down on us.
Anyone remaining will be forcibly removed.<eos> Any resistance will be met with swift and permanent force.<eos> Just slow down, slow down.<eos> All y'all, just slow down with them guns.<eos> Just because you have a trespassing charge don't give none of you the right to be shooting guys.
Unless... unless... if I may interject here, unless we choose not to have fun and act like assholes.<eos> Then it's not gonna be pretty. Trust me.<eos> But none of us are assholes, and actually using language like that is one example of what not to do on this trip.<eos> Actually, make your own rules for yourself, because I'm...<eos> I make rules for myself, you make rules for you, and then I make rules for you guys as well.
So, a.B.C.<eos> Ian's rules<eos> (1) Abc - always be caming always be camming, bitches.<eos> 'Cause the next generation's coming, and they're going to replace you.<eos> Just like you replaced the whores before you.
Listen, boys, now if it wins, I'm gonna sort you both out.<eos> You too, Carlton, man.<eos> Good karma?<eos> You know, isn't it?<eos> You know, I might be just stupid enough to think that if the shoe was on the other foot, you two would do the same for me?
And this might be my last chance.<eos> And our friend, Yiannis, is right.<eos> I mean, opportunities are limited right now.<eos> Jack, you are gonna give me the betting slip and I'm gonna go claim my money.<eos> And in the meantime, you three monkeys are gonna sit with my two pals.
"C'est beaucoup mieux" than my Spanish.<eos> No problem.<eos> Your French will get better with practice.<eos> "Au revoir".<eos> Or as you say, "see you"
The abbess has gone to confront that important French soldier.<eos> - Where is she?<eos> - In the entrance to the convent.<eos> I said that we're not going to pay and we're not going to pay.<eos> You all think you're so different with you "libert√©" and your "√©galit√©" and "fraternit√©" but after everything you're all the same - tyrants.
"Je suis d√©sol√©".<eos> "Parlar√© slowly" so that you understand me.<eos> I understand you...<eos> as much as you want.<eos> I can assure you that I will personally convince the bishop to pay what you are asking.
It's... office procedure.<eos> Ok.<eos> Fine, let's get to the point.<eos> You're saying that Argamasilla could reveal our secret?<eos> Argamasilla and Gromek have been caught meeting a few times before this one you are seeing here.
And much less under my tenure in this ministry.<eos> It's a shame that my agents can't work together with yours.<eos> It's still too soon, I guess.<eos> We have to keep our distance.<eos> But as you all say, "todo se andar√°."
And again and again.<eos> Did you really have to pretend to be a clairvoyant?<eos> - Relax.<eos> - Oh, the police.<eos> You know what you have to do. No, no, no.
I'm talking about going over what's been done up until now - and correcting any possible errors.<eos> - Nothing but excitement and adventure.<eos> - Don't get too disappointed just yet.<eos> As the team leader, Amelia will be in charge of reports.<eos> You two will make note of newly appeared doors, catalog them, traveling through and taking note of place and time.
That's where we can best defend ourselves.<eos> Now is not the time to defend ourselves, but to attack.<eos> Do what I've said!<eos> Yes, Sir.<eos> You all, with me.
I really need to get ready for work.<eos> Don't let us stop you.<eos> We got it covered.<eos> Good to go.<eos> Ok, girls, you cook that up.
I know that.<eos> I'm trying to test him out to see if he changes his answer.<eos> What are your intentions toward Bella?<eos> I like her very much.<eos> I appreciate that you two are close family, but really, I think I'd rather tell Bella to her face before you two interrogate me any further.
Right, yes.<eos> Of course.<eos> Hello?<eos> Come on, girls.<eos> My dear Bella, As per my somewhat pedantic instructions, I assume that you are all in your garden, which I hope is looking as good as I expect.
Cap.<eos> - Cap.<eos> - How's it goin'?<eos> It's goin' fine, just fine.<eos> How are you all doin'?
Maybe we find something helps us both out.<eos> All we wanted.<eos> A little cooperation.<eos> You got it.<eos> You two aren't going anywhere.
This is Central City in 2016.<eos> At least it was.<eos> I'm not sure what the neo-fascists who took control of it are calling it these days.<eos> There must be a way to correct this somehow.<eos> Fortunately, Gideon is just showing us a forecast of the future you've all created.
So we just need to be able to track them.<eos> Fortunately, Alpha Particles are highly trackable.<eos> Yet unheard of in the 1970s.<eos> It's like we're trapped in the Stone Age.<eos> I'll have you know that I was researching Alpha Particles when you were eating crayons.
I'll have you know that I was researching Alpha Particles when you were eating crayons.<eos> So to track that piece of Raymond's super-suit, we just need to talk to...<eos> Me.<eos> 25-year-old me, rather.<eos> You two are just in time.
We had to do it.<eos> Yeah, Marco.<eos> Yeah, I'll be right there.<eos> You gonna make him stand out there all day with your pizza?<eos> All right, you're doing the dishes.
You want to leave the car?<eos> Are you asking me to leave the car?<eos> - Fuck that.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> I leave the car, you take the car.
FBI Hostage Rescue will be taking over.<eos> All right, let's get striking'.<eos> Victor 1-1, Victor 2-4, let's move everybody into position.<eos> We're clear out here.<eos> - Who the fuck are you?
It goes quicker.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Who are you people?<eos> I get the curiosity, but we have questions ourselves.<eos> And we'll be the ones asking them while we drive you back to wherever it is you call home.
Come on.<eos> They're moving towards the gunfire.<eos> That shout.<eos> I suppose someone thought they could put up a fight.<eos> I guess you all thought that.
- Take a deep breath.<eos> -Mr. denholz, when you make contact with the children's father, can you please share your findings with the court immediately?<eos> The respondent and her counsel would be grateful to have that information prior to our next court hearing, your honor.<eos> Due noted, Ms. Fisher, along with your sarcastic tone.<eos> And will you two please stop the chattering?
Looking forward to seeing Julie?<eos> No.<eos> -No, we're finished.<eos> -What?<eos> You two were inseparable.
You are.<eos> You take after me.<eos> No, I take after mama.<eos> Your mother and i always talked about you and Denise.<eos> How you two turned out, best thing we ever did.
-It is my medical record.<eos> -It was too small for you to read before.<eos> Have your eyes become sensitive to white light, like ours?<eos> We prefer softer bands of the spectrum, like, uh, purple, yellow.<eos> -Are you trying to make me into you?
There are markers in your profile.<eos> Your blood pressures, certain allergies, family histories. All these details showed us the G10-12 x-sequence in your gene be accessible.<eos> -Enough.<eos> -I have seen you.<eos> You're not human. None of you are.
Get down now!<eos> hold on!<eos> What shall we do with the white horse?<eos> So what do you think?<eos> You're well-built.
We need to protect him as his disciples all the way<eos> My name is Zhu Ganglie<eos> I've sworn to the Goddess that I'll abstain from eating meat you can also call me Bajie<eos> My name is Sha Wujing<eos> Do you know who I am?
I was seen as a demon<eos> That's just a story about my previous life<eos> It's a true story<eos> Don't think you're different from those who had left me on the lone cliff<eos> You immortals are just merciless
--I'm freezing.<eos> Hmm... well, I hear his mom's room has a fireplace.<eos> - Are you kidding?<eos> - Oh, yeah?<eos> Okay, well, you know, you are cleaning the sheets.
She's a weapon!<eos> Do you seriously wanna fight the Demogorgon with your wrist rocket?<eos> That's like R2-D2 going to fight Darth Vader.<eos> We're no use to Will if we're dead.<eos> If you two wanna waste your time looking for a traitor, go ahead, 'cause I'm not spending my time on her anymore.
...son of a bitch!<eos> Lucas, if you can hear us, slow down.<eos> We can't understand you.<eos> Yes, I copy!<eos> Do you?
Oh, that's funny, because I don't remember you asking me to stop.<eos> I should've put that spray paint right down your throat.<eos> - What the hell, Steve?<eos> - You know, neither of you ever cared about her.<eos> You never even liked her, because she's not miserable like you two.
F-G, G-F,<eos> F-B-flat, G.<eos> I mean, The Kinks are all right, but that's just not who we are.<eos> No shit.<eos> But who you are ain't getting signed.
Members of the House are...<eos> You're a public servant, George.<eos> You don't have a right to privacy right now.<eos> You need to delay the Senate vote on Thomas and hold a full hearing on these charges.<eos> Look, I'm just as upset about this as you are.
When I walk out that door today, we are friends for life, or you don't exist to me ever again.<eos> I'm about to go on the run of a lifetime.<eos> I am aligned.<eos> I feel it.<eos> And I know you can see it.
I'm sure this is very hard for them.<eos> $500,000 was left in the name of Chelsea Rayne.<eos> Are you Chelsea Rayne?<eos> All Michael left was your telephone number.<eos> He said you two had become very close.
You're a natural, and you don't know who Grandmaster Flash is?<eos> Shit.<eos> All right, punks.<eos> Y'all want to go to the flyest... secret underground party in the entire Bronx... you follow me.<eos> You decide.
So you wanna tell me why I'm in blues and you're not?<eos> You'll see.<eos> Well, welcome to Post One.<eos> The only secure way in and out of the chancery.<eos> All the classified hard drives get stored in there and, as you know, our number-one mission as embassy guards is to protect that material.
- Meaning?<eos> - Learn to be accepting of differences.<eos> Try at least.<eos> If you're referring to that nutcase Moira you placed in my room, I beg to differ.<eos> You want me to help you because you're not capable of handling her obsessive-compulsive disorders.
I'll hold this while you do the stairs.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - Need a hand?<eos> Bad girl, you mustn't do things like this!<eos> You're all my guests, my family donated this villa!
- Calm down.<eos> - No!<eos> Girls, go to bed She's fine.<eos> I don't want to sleep.<eos> You hate me... yes.
We're guests at a villa not far from here, it's quite prestigious and once belonged to Marchioness C√†stora Biondi Valdirana, my great-aunt.<eos> Due to some red tape... they've retained our credit cards, ATM cards, and such.<eos> And how can I help you?<eos> Could you advance us some cash, 2-3,000 euros, nothing substantial...<eos> I'm perfectly fine, you're the ones who aren't well!
- Then go to wardrobe.<eos> - We're together.<eos> Shut up, dummy.<eos> I'm thrilled we'll be in a cabriolet, I adore cabriolets!<eos> Are you in scene 38 too?
Do you realize you may be committing a crime?<eos> Aiding and abetting.<eos> Know where she is?<eos> If so, you should inform the authorities.<eos> You have the wrong idea about her.
I'm fine.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Let's go sit down... get some ice in a cafe...<eos> You okay?<eos> We are, but you're clearly not with those outfits!
But I don't know what's going on here.<eos> Okay, you know that your father and I are separated, and eventually I'm gonna be seeing people.<eos> The tattoo guy?<eos> His name is Josh.<eos> And you're, like, a couple?
We are so excited for you.<eos> Liza...<eos> I know you may have some sour grapes after your breakup, but I would really love for you to support me right now.<eos> - Of course.<eos> - And just so all of you know, I've changed my relationship status to "engaged."
I'm pushing you guys.<eos> But it's my job.<eos> - It is?<eos> - Yes.<eos> And you're pushing back, which I appreciate.
Would you fancy a picture?<eos> - [laughs] - Okay.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Long live the union of Kelsey and Thad.<eos> Okay, you two should go get in line for the Cava chandelier.
We weren't hit by any rival family there.<eos> I'm telling you, we were... hit by an army.<eos> - That's quite the story.<eos> - It's a fact.<eos> And believe me, you can go see for yourself.
Well, live it up now because the next thing you know, they turn into that.<eos> Hi, Mom.<eos> Wow. I'm looking around the room and realizing that after tonight, everyone is going to be gone.<eos> You're leaving.<eos> You're leaving.
You're leaving.<eos> You're leaving.<eos> You're leaving.<eos> You already left.<eos> I hope you're leaving.
Guys, please, sit down.<eos> We're having a little talk.<eos> What?<eos> Sit.<eos> You're all moving to LA, and you're going back to Vegas.
Oh.<eos> Okay. Well, 20 minutes early, all right?<eos> But then I can't guarantee anything after...<eos> On time.<eos> Get there on time, you know how to manage your schedule.
Yeah, you need some bling.<eos> I'm gonna win you a necklace.<eos> You don't have to w...<eos> Okay.<eos> You know, I don't think I could do what you're doing.
We were just heading to Anthony's party.<eos> - That's crazy.<eos> - That is crazy.<eos> - That's...<eos> - All right, you're my dates.
They skipped. Laughing.<eos> She didn't scare them.<eos> -Oh, no? -They were having fun.<eos> But it still don't answer where they gone.<eos> Have you two seen 'em anywhere?
Anita built a sand castle.<eos> Crazy Eyes found a turtle.<eos> You're all a bunch of assholes.<eos> I feel like we all married the lake.<eos> -Don't you, ladies?
Remember, upper hand, right away.<eos> Establish dominance.<eos> Got it.<eos> Hapakuka, Dwight.<eos> You're in here, bottom right, top left.
There's a patient here I was speaking with.<eos> - A family member? - No.<eos> Then you don't belong here.<eos> This is my family's hotel.<eos> You are the one who doesn't belong.
Santa?<eos> You know, 75% of all sidewalk Santa's have Hepatitis C.<eos> Don't put your fingers in his beard.<eos> Thank you for that very fun fact, Brooks.<eos> Look, baby, soon as Daddy's done here, I'm going to take you to do whatever you want to do, okay?
- I'm sorry, Jack.<eos> - Cozy little reunion.<eos> Open it up.<eos> Yeah, I can't.<eos> Keygen's gone. I lost it in the fall, but a man with your resources, I'm sure you can figure a way into it in the privacy of your own home, or lair, or whatever assholes like you have.
Hey, how's it going?<eos> I'm doing amazing.<eos> I slept in late, skipped my workout, had, like, four donuts.<eos> I told these kids,<eos> "Look, you get yourself ready for school today."
I'm the one made it a hit.<eos> I'm sure David Gates would beg to differ.<eos> Hey, hey, relax, man!<eos> You have any idea how hard I pushed that album?<eos> That's why "Make It With You" was a hit, but you don't even understand what I do.
- Poor thing was recently widowed...<eos> Yes, Dr. Hale, I'm aware.<eos> No need to be ashamed of your inexperience.<eos> Emma: This is my family's hotel.<eos> You are the one who doesn't belong.
Rachel's parents are here. They're outside.<eos> They're here now. I'm gonna go tell Josh.<eos> What?<eos> But, like, you'll do, like, fun stuff and...<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah, anything that you need...
I loved her very much.<eos> And then I guess she thought that the best way to return that would be to kill herself on my fucking birthday!<eos> So, I don't know.<eos> That's what I'm left with and... and... and I'm even sorry now.<eos> Like, you know, 'cause now I'm dragging you guys in. I'm pulling you guys into this shit, and you have your own lives.
First tip of diaper changing, never breathe through your nose.<eos> Second tip, do not look directly at what you're doing.<eos> By the way, this is a great time to use up that bottle of J-Lo perfume your grandma got you for Christmas.<eos> Maybe we shouldn't have flushed that.<eos> We were never here and you never saw this.
Wow, Steve.<eos> Your hair was great.<eos> Our kids would have that hair.<eos> Not for long.<eos> What are you two doing here?
‚ô™ Angel... ‚ô™<eos> Sorry, sorry.<eos> Just a little cold feet.<eos> They're all warmed up now.<eos> I'm skipping to the "I do's." I know you two do.
As you know, there's been some controversy with several of the hospitals up near Longboat Key.<eos> I sat down with councilman and zoning Board president Tom D'Esposito and some local healthcare professionals for an exclusive interview to talk about it and how it ties into what might be a larger crisis in Sarasota.<eos> A zoning crisis.<eos> Projector two.<eos> You can't see, but I'm standing on the line that divides Manatee and Sarasota Counties.
We're drowning here, guys.<eos> ABC is not kicking in what they promised this quarter.<eos> The last round of local ads didn't hit, so people aren't re-upping.<eos> I know this is all just fun and games for you.<eos> You're all just breezing through here on your way to a national market. But the situation is getting fucking dire.
Thanks. We are.<eos> How long have you been together?<eos> It's our third anniversary.<eos> Oh.<eos> You must think I'm crazy.
Let us get back to our dinner."<eos> I am...<eos> I'm real sorry to interrupt.<eos> I just...<eos> You just made my night.
He's actually picking up another station in Baltimore.<eos> So I guess he's doubling down on this whole news thing.<eos> Wait, so he wants to hire one of us to work in Baltimore?<eos> It's a top 30 market.<eos> I love how quickly you've all moved off your fear of getting fired.
Gentlemen, welcome.<eos> Thank you so much for coming.<eos> I'm the proprietor and you can call me Nyx.<eos> Coming up next, the lovely Miss Torin.<eos> You boys are with me.
That's emotion.<eos> You don't even know the fucking scenario.<eos> You don't even know what happened.<eos> So I'ma give you a scenario.<eos> Let's say you and your man taking a walk.
My lady is the queen of hypothetical thoughts.<eos> You know what I feel like?<eos> I feel like all women suffer from this disease.<eos> Women love to ask men questions about shit that would never happen.<eos> You love it.
You love it.<eos> "Babe, babe, what would you do if...<eos> "Babe, babe, hypothetically speaking, but not really, but if it did,<eos> "what could might be, huh?"<eos> You love it.
Let me tell you, here's why I was mad.<eos> I was mad at the fact that they make contraptions for men.<eos> Like, fellas, if we wanna use something to please ourselves sexually, we look like creeps.<eos> Perverts.<eos> Women, you got it made.
From there, if the state rules against you, we'll have a chance at the Supreme Court.<eos> That sounds wonderful.<eos> I have one little piece of housekeeping.<eos> LIFE magazine contacted us about sending a photographer out to you all.<eos> Keeping the possibility of the Supreme Court in mind, I think it's a fair idea that we raise the profile of your case, but I, of course, want to make sure that you are all comfortable with that.
It's very good.<eos> Well, I have some really terrific news.<eos> The Supreme Court has agreed to hear our case.<eos> Now, of course, the state of Virginia will mount their defense, but we are feeling very good about our chances here.<eos> You've got the full weight of the ACLU behind this.
Pbht.<eos> - Chef.<eos> Gwynne.<eos> - Milady.<eos> You two have to help me escape and find Galavant.
Thank you!<eos> - I'm gonna go find my table.<eos> Thank you. How you doing?<eos> My name is penn jillette of penn and teller, and we're gonna give as much money as we can.<eos> I will hurt myself, then you will hurt yourself with money.
- Well, I've still got the touch Once a cop, always a cop<eos> - Is my old mug still here?<eos> - It seems he's right<eos> You need to look out for that riff-raft on the ferry<eos> √Åsgeir, you should know all about that
Then I'll volunteer to be that man<eos> Father...<eos> RUNNING WATER<eos> My husband's in the shower.<eos> You can take one when he's done.
Can I ask you something?<eos> Yeah<eos> Did Hj√∂rtur take those Twitter photos?<eos> Why do you think so?<eos> You've released him, so he can't be the killer
Do you need something?<eos> OK, your partner, Trausti, is unreachable<eos> And when he answers, he just gives me lip<eos> Yes, I know...<eos> You have an obligation to inform the public
Yes, I know...<eos> You have an obligation to inform the public<eos> I'm just a desk jockey it's not acceptable for a superior to treat the press this way<eos> Especially with a case like this - No...<eos> - You need us sometimes as well I don't know what to say
He's not my friend.<eos> And why don't you ask him yourself?<eos> This questioning's over<eos> The Danish consulate's put a stop to it<eos> I don't know what the hell you think you're doing
- You're all right?<eos> - Yes, I'm fine.<eos> Hinrika is not coming home tonight.<eos> Police work.<eos> I know so little what you have been through.
- That's not true<eos> Have you seen your dad?<eos> I need a word with him<eos> I think he's painting at our house<eos> You're my girls
Yeah, that's right, give it up.<eos> But my son, Hakeem, has become a mogul in his own right.<eos> He helped me build Lyon Dynasty from nothing, and for that he deserves your respect.<eos> And yours, too.<eos> So why don't you come up here and show these shareholders that you will not fight with one another, but instead you will fight together to make this company great like they... like we all deserve, right?
What?<eos> No, thanks.<eos> Why not?<eos> Do you have something better to do?<eos> I know your type, and you're not gonna play me.
A Machine that spies on you every hour of every day.<eos> You've granted it the power to see everything, to index, order, and control the lives of ordinary people.<eos> The government considers these people irrelevant.<eos> We don't.<eos> But to it, you are all irrelevant.
Changed man.<eos> So what'd you do with Agent LeRoux?<eos> Left him in a trunk.<eos> Guess I haven't changed that much.<eos> You two want to kiss good-bye?
Breathe.<eos> -I freezes so.<eos> You're just scared.<eos> America's most celebrated media.<eos> In the evening, you will not witness a performance.
-I freezes so.<eos> You're just scared.<eos> America's most celebrated media.<eos> In the evening, you will not witness a performance.<eos> You will experience something. In order not to disturb their concentration I pray replaced
No.<eos> E-V-E-L-Y-N.<eos> You're the ALS Society.<eos> The idea is you tell me.<eos> Well, what's the point of having a society if you can't help each other?
The police have been following them, they...<eos> Is something illegal going on here?<eos> That's a very good question you ask.<eos> Oh, look, girls!<eos> Are, are you Black Panthers?
We're from the gas company.<eos> We understand there was a gas leak reported.<eos> No, no, that was a while ago.<eos> It's okay.<eos> - Who are you two?
How do we know you're not undercover agents?<eos> For who?<eos> The FBI.<eos> We're here to check a gas leak.<eos> Who are you?
- Thanks, dad. Prom ended at 11.<eos> - You guys gonna come with us?<eos> - No, we're all set.<eos> We're just gonna ride this out until... - we save the world?<eos> - You guys?
- I'm gonna go with a soft, maybe.<eos> Fuck.<eos> We got trouble up ahead.<eos> - I don't we can get around this shit, man.<eos> - You glorious fucks cover me, I'll move the Humvee.
- Alright.<eos> - Now, gentlemen, stand down.<eos> Alright. - Colonel, it's been a minute.<eos> How you been?<eos> - I'm surprised that you two ass hats are still alive.
- Dude, you dogged 14?<eos> Champion!<eos> - No, that's not a high five moment.<eos> - Every moments a high five moment.<eos> - You boys have the whiskey?
- Everybody, lets get inside, quick.<eos> - Most people don't get to decide how they go out.<eos> There's a time to run and a time to fight<eos> and I ain't no bird dog.<eos> - You must be the brave soldiers that colonel Holloway sent.
That looks painful. What'll we do?<eos> Can we get through this without any pain?<eos> I wish.<eos> Let's give it try.<eos> You two look alike.
Can we get through this without any pain?<eos> I wish.<eos> Let's give it try.<eos> You two look alike.<eos> He says you two look quite alike.
Tell him that it's delicious.<eos> He really is a bit greedy.<eos> Go!<eos> Attention!<eos> You are all excellent marksmen.
I heard a totally unfounded accusation.<eos> Answer the question, Commander.<eos> You know what?<eos> A great hero, perhaps the greatest hero since SuperShock, has just been savagely murdered.<eos> And you want to rake up some muck.
I wish I could go back and make it right, but I...<eos> I'm sorry I...<eos> I'm sorry I hurt your daughter.<eos> Well...<eos> I hope you two are working together to find a fair and equitable way to move forward.
Fuck me in the fuckhole.<eos> Colonel, thank you for meeting us. What a pleasure.<eos> Richie Finestra.<eos> - This is my partner Zak...<eos> - You're not here. I'm not here.
‚ô™ You know my Suffragette City... ‚ô™<eos> Kid's gonna make something of himself one day.<eos> ‚ô™ Oh, hit me ‚ô™<eos> ‚ô™ Don't lean on me, man, 'cause you ain't got time to check it ‚ô™<eos> ‚ô™ You know my Suffragette City ‚ô™
I'm not here as a declaration of war, but as a beacon of hope... Someone who knows how a business should be run, who sees exactly why your brand is bleeding market share, from the ingredients to the marketing.<eos> You are in a room full of career business operators.<eos> You are in a room full of career business operators.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> And I've been made to understand that you're the reasonable board members who see how tenuous the future of YumTime is.
Mom.<eos> Sir?<eos> Sir.<eos> I'm sorry...<eos> - ...but who are you two?
No crisis.<eos> He's violating every civil code we have.<eos> - What are you trying to pull?<eos> - Knock it off.<eos> We're not gonna get anywhere with you two locking heads.
It looks just like him.<eos> James Cole.<eos> I'm so glad that we have this time.<eos> Do you remember when we would go out and raid survivor camps?<eos> And you would get all judge-y?
You have until dawn.<eos> The Emerson Hotel, Suite 607.<eos> The day he called you and you refused to help.<eos> Why do The Daughters care about the fate of James Cole?<eos> James Cole understands something you all have forgotten.
Kill Liu Xuan!<eos> Hello.<eos> - Hello...<eos> - Hello.<eos> You know each other?
..<eos> Now I'm going to hunt her down and make fish soup out of her!<eos> Mermaids are highly intelligent unknown species.<eos> They're fierce and capable of making weapons.<eos> They're extremely dangerous so as soon as you see them use full force!
Yeah, early bird's got nothing on the night owl.<eos> Let's see what you have here.<eos> Agnes Cully, Broxton, Oklahoma... sounds interesting.<eos> Almost sorry I... pulled Carter away from all the fun.<eos> I'm sure you two have plenty of excitement waiting for you back in New York.
Almost sorry I... pulled Carter away from all the fun.<eos> I'm sure you two have plenty of excitement waiting for you back in New York.<eos> Yeah.<eos> She's still a pistol.<eos> You two seem to have patched up whatever it was that sent you packing out west.
I'll never be free again, not after this.<eos> This stuff's gonna buy me a couple of days.<eos> You can get out of town, run.<eos> Or the SSR can protect you.<eos> Are you two really that dumb?
President McKinley, Black Tuesday...<eos> You think those things just happened?<eos> Run?<eos> I'm already dead.<eos> And so are you.
Yeah, we went.<eos> Um, it was great.<eos> A lot of kids, though.<eos> And fat people.<eos> Well, this is America, you know.
when I get back.<eos> You're a virgin, too, aren't you, Jack?<eos> I don't think we need to talk about that.<eos> So you're telling me that we have two foreign boys who are both virgins?<eos> Oh, I shouldn't laugh because, you know, it wasn't easy for me either with the girls.
Oh, my God.<eos> Did you get invited to Tucker's YouTube party?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Wait, how do you know about that?<eos> Oh, yeah, well, you know, me and some of the moms, we have a FaceChat group at the school where we get together and chat and gossip.
Y...<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> What do you think, girl, you wanna go?<eos> Mmm, I don't know. What do you think?
Drinking the juice in the hood, yeah?<eos> Fuck, man, that's fake.<eos> Shit, man, we're poor as shit.<eos> Man, we're still in high school.<eos> Liars, you told me you're president of an oil company and you said you create video games.
And fuck you, Chocolate Rain.<eos> Great advice, man.<eos> And he's just, like, under my bed, dead.<eos> I'm like, "Are you alive?"<eos> He doesn't say anything 'cause he's dead, you know?
The Beverly Hills Carlton Hotel, oh, Diana it's just marvellous.<eos> It had these hourglass pools, parties every night.<eos> - Oh, darling, you must come.<eos> - I'd love to.<eos> What are you two wittering on about?
Huh. I wonder what happens to all this when it's over.<eos> Don't answer that, my freezers are full.<eos> Well, w? re a mathadist, trough and throug...<eos> Catholic lite, I call it.<eos> Yeah, and what are you?
I'm actually really sorry about that.<eos> Nah, but I'm sorry too.<eos> - Christ!<eos> What the fuck did you do that for? Why?<eos> Do you seriously think I believe you two are stupid enough to lose - lose! - seven million euros worth of coke?
Funny, my dad said the same thing.<eos> And one day a big fish passed and swallowed him and his business<eos> Yes well, both parents are rare And I say that the ocean waits for the brave<eos> Big and dark, the perfect place So that cowards find themselves<eos> You are a funny couple
I just changed one ingredient<eos> Can you answer the fucking question?<eos> Shean<eos> Shean what?<eos> Are not you curious to know about this guy?
Definitely<eos> Yes Yes<eos> I'm not a fucking tourist And frankly it offends me that you think it is<eos> You could have at least offered me a transfer you are playing with me<eos> You are two children Small, very selfish Without consideration for these amazing women
You put me and all of us in danger in our house<eos> How could you?<eos> Yeah, Mark, how could you?<eos> There she is<eos> You are imbeciles
What a twist.<eos> Welcome to "38 Neighbors," a theatrical retelling of the Kitty Genovese tragedy.<eos> In 1964, Kitty Genovese was murdered outside her home in the middle of the night.<eos> Dozens of neighbors heard her cries for help and did nothing.<eos> And you are about to become one of them.
Good. Stay angry.<eos> Remember why you lost today.<eos> Every time you step into a perpetrator's apartment or a trafficker's hideout, they have home-field advantage.<eos> They will have had a lifetime to prepare for a fight.<eos> You have 60 seconds.
Are you're seriously gonna pretend like you don't know?<eos> Know what?<eos> We submitted five names, but because of your tantrum, they decided to cut from our class, too.<eos> We didn't break the rules... you did.<eos> Are you saying we had something
Snoop: Wait! Wait!<eos> Wait... Gonna fucking kill you!<eos> Hold on, hold on, hold on.<eos> Break this shit up, man.<eos> Look, Bubbs is about to get on stage and you're all bullshitting, man.
Robberies, guns, doesn't matter.<eos> Look, just, hang on now, let's...<eos> All right.<eos> (Whispering) Fuck's sakes...<eos> But you two are on fucking slim ice.
Look, let me tell you something.<eos> When I said I wanted to invest in the park, I meant you.<eos> All of y'all. Shit, I could buy 20 motherfucking trailer parks and call them Sunnyvale.<eos> But it don't matter. It's about the people.<eos> Like it or not, you motherfuckers is family and I consider y'all my family.
I need to get practicing.<eos> Come on, buddy. Don't quit just 'cause you suck at something.<eos> I don't suck at it! You fucking suck at it.<eos> That's why you brought it to me.<eos> Remember? Boys! What the hell did you put on the internet?
Yeah, man. It's starting to really pick up now.<eos> You know, hoping that people from all over the world will come visit this place sometime, you know?<eos> Yeah, you... you must know some people, do you,<eos> Jimmy Kimmel, that might come up? (Crowd laughing) I know a lot of people.<eos> Yes, of course I do. And you're on right now.
Boys, put the guns down! Sorry about this, Jimmy Kimmel!<eos> I... it's... (Repeated beeping, distorted signal) ...fucking shoot somebody!<eos> (Whimper) Ricky, put the fucking gun down!<eos> You put your fucking gun down!<eos> You put your fucking gun down first! Boys, I was talking to Jimmy Kimmel and you fucking ruined it!
Yes, because you always remained very human.<eos> I am reminded of a Victor Hugo quote.<eos> Oh, yeah. We alll have extraordinary references!<eos> Yes, the van Peteghems are always "a force that goes"!<eos> - And that's what you are!
Just wait 'till I get my hooves on them!<eos> Anyway you look at it, this is not good.<eos> Mac can't be gone.<eos> What's that?<eos> And who are you two?
Sanitarium offered me enough to buy a new one.<eos> Everything happens for a reason, right?<eos> You drink too much.<eos> I hope you're not driving.<eos> You two are from up on the hill?
He has been spending time with Mrs. Watkins.<eos> Who is Watkins?<eos> She was institutionalized before she came to us.<eos> The others humor her... but clearly Mr. Lockhart's condition has made him susceptible to her conspiracies.<eos> I know what you're trying to do.
Yeah, whatever Jasper wants, and screw the rest of us.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> Screw Clarke.<eos> You are both mass murderers, as far as I'm concerned.
I told you it would startle her.<eos> I felt like I needed to show people that she's my girlfriend.<eos> You can't go around and pretend you're single.<eos> What kind of person do you take me for?<eos> You two look good.
Take her out of here so that it doesn't cause a scene.<eos> You think you'll be safe after doing this to me?<eos> Do you know who I am?<eos> I'm the daughter of Taerang Group's Chairman Yoo.<eos> You're the ones who don't know your place.
Is that why you did that to Baek In Ha?<eos> All right, I'll leave.<eos> I'll get lost like you want me to.<eos> So please just leave us alone.<eos> Actually, can't you two please leave me alone?
She was talking to us.<eos> Sorry about the confusion.<eos> "Sorry about the confusion"?<eos> They're AIM agents.<eos> You don't have to be nice to them.
And... action!<eos> I don't know what kind of deal with the devil you made, but we know what we saw!<eos> If I believed you actually had the courage to tell someone, then I might actually be afraid.<eos> Ain't no regular girl able to kill a man like that with her own mind.<eos> I think you two is witches.
- Okay, miss you, love you.<eos> - Miss you...<eos> Bye. - Turn the stove off.<eos> - All right.<eos> So, do you both edit reality TV shows?
Not to mention an unknown number of hostages.<eos> God, what did they teach you about hostage situations at the academy?<eos> -Deploy overwhelming force.<eos> -Yeah.<eos> You two don't look so overwhelming.
This is Central City in 2016.<eos> At least it was.<eos> I'm not sure what the neo-fascists who took control of it are calling it these days.<eos> There must be a way to correct this somehow.<eos> Fortunately, Gideon is just showing us a forecast of the future you've all created.
So we just need to be able to track them.<eos> Fortunately, Alpha Particles are highly trackable.<eos> Yet unheard of in the 1970s.<eos> It's like we're trapped in the Stone Age.<eos> I'll have you know that I was researching Alpha Particles when you were eating crayons.
I'll have you know that I was researching Alpha Particles when you were eating crayons.<eos> So to track that piece of Raymond's super-suit, we just need to talk to...<eos> Me.<eos> 25-year-old me, rather.<eos> You two are just in time.
Actually mom, not husband... he wants to be my wife<eos> What?<eos> Interesting...<eos> Meaning you will eat for free?<eos> You women think like men... and then call us chauvinists!
Well, he is certainly a great talent.<eos> Now, Hail, Caesar!<eos> is a prestige picture, our biggest release of the year, and we're devoting huge resources to its production in order to make it first-class in every respect.<eos> Gentlemen, given its enormous expense, we don't wanna send it to market except in the certainty that it will not offend any reasonable American regardless of faith or creed.<eos> Now that's where you come in.
He's a bachelor.<eos> And very angry.<eos> No, no, he used to be angry.<eos> What? He got over it?<eos> You worship the God of another age.
- And when do I get Baird? - When we have the money.<eos> I'll do it right now.<eos> Can I use your belt?<eos> The Swingin' Dinghy is closing, folks.<eos> Time for me to clean up, time for you to clear out.
He's a fan.<eos> Uh-huh. That's swell.<eos> So, I black out, I wake up here... And I say to myself,<eos> "Baird, you gotta stop doing this."<eos> But you're saying, actually, technically, I was kidnapped.
We're with the FBI.<eos> At a time like this, we can all just be human beings.<eos> If there's anything we can do to make you more comfortable...<eos> Comfortable.<eos> There is nothing you or a-anyone can do to make me comfortable.
He called Jason "Meeja" his whole life.<eos> It can't be a coincidence.<eos> Wait, hold on.<eos> Hold on. I'm sorry.<eos> - Who are you? - One minute.
Meet.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hello.<eos> I hope we're not interrupting anything.<eos> My friend Spot says you are friends of his.
Davik, take your sisters and you can all go wash your suckers.<eos> It's almost time for supper.<eos> Forgive us.<eos> We don't get too many visitors.<eos> - But you've met someone like me before?
Howard, tell us of these "fahar animals".<eos> Oh, we keep the bigger animals in special areas.<eos> We drink their milk, wear their hides, and eat their meat.<eos> Not sure about the rest.<eos> How destructive these creatures must be that you have to devour them.
I would've, right up in a tree.<eos> - I would've.<eos> - No. I know.<eos> Almost as soon as we got to Alexandria, you got it.<eos> You saw... you... and Michonne, Glenn, you all tried to tell me.
Our communities can help each other.<eos> Thank you, Natalie. Been a good talk.<eos> We can help each other.<eos> We're doing fine.<eos> Are you?
We need food.<eos> We came all this way, we're gonna get it.<eos> I will talk to him and we will work this out.<eos> Circumstances change.<eos> We're doing well now, and you will next.
Well, how many people does Negan have?<eos> We don't know.<eos> We've seen groups as big as 20.<eos> Now, hold up.<eos> So, they show up, they kill a kid, and you give them half of everything?
See, I had leverage and I used it.<eos> It wasn't personal.<eos> Yes.<eos> We need food.<eos> You have it.
Captain, you were there.<eos> Obviously, the guy was suffering from some severe form of PTSD.<eos> There was nothing that we could do.<eos> It's all a matter of perspective.<eos> You two were in the room with him.
Right.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - That's right.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - And I feel it. Do you? - Uh-huh.
Damn right I'm not.<eos> And it's causing you to lose more control.<eos> If you wanna get it back, if you really wanna survive this thing, then you may need to set aside the piece of you that's... raging, and do something that makes you a little uncomfortable.<eos> - He's not gonna flip?<eos> - No, he will, because you're gonna make it happen.
What... what is it about the cult of Bobby Axelrod that makes them wanna immolate themselves?<eos> You wouldn't understand.<eos> You're a lawyer.<eos> Persuade me.<eos> You're at the mercy of politics.
You've known about this for weeks.<eos> You're bringing it up now because you wanna know something. What is it you wanna know?<eos> Why don't you take it all out?<eos> I am not my husband.<eos> And I am not going to be the shuttlecock that you two smack back and forth.
I wanna shoot straight with you from the beginning, which is not usually how I work.<eos> Did you just say that out loud?<eos> For some reason, I don't wanna bullshit you into giving me a retainer.<eos> I wonder why that is.<eos> You all have 'em.
You know, when we started this little business, we thought it was gonna be the two of us selling our boutique robes practically door-to-door.<eos> And now we've got 40 employees, and half the luxury hotels in America have our bathrobes on the bathroom door.<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> - It is an amazing success story.<eos> And to think, you two are doing it together all day.
Previously on "Billions"...<eos> I am not my husband, and I am not going to be the shuttlecock that you two smack back and forth.
You've made your point.<eos> You've made your point.<eos> Armenians aren't singing?<eos> Oh, that's right.<eos> You're the resident infidel.
Vartan.<eos> Lena.<eos> Close the door.<eos> This is your Uncle Vartan.<eos> Who are you?
Don't! Don't!<eos> Don't! To execute you as a foreign agent and a collaborator! Don't!<eos> Now, was that my barbarism or mercy?<eos> Take him!<eos> Who are you?
Myers attacked our men, and he has been collaborating with traitors.<eos> Nonsense.<eos> He's a world-renowned journalist.<eos> He's a spy, and he has used journalism to smear the Ottoman Empire and its soldiers around the world with his fabrication about the relocation of the Armenians.<eos> Minister, you are using this so-called "relocation" as a cover for the systematic extermination of the Armenian people.
It's like this guy looks at the world through the wrong end of the telescope, all right?<eos> He's not all there.<eos> He wants it his way or no way.<eos> I can't do business with somebody like that.<eos> Well, sounds like you two have some history.
See, you have to find your sweet spot.<eos> So distance.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> Distance along with proper technique is where you're the most powerful.<eos> Now you try.
You tried.<eos> And now I'm fired.<eos> Goodbye, Mafee.<eos> The next voice you hear will be the BioLance CEO, Brooks Wellever.<eos> - So you all know how important the development of our SGLT 2 inhibitor for treatment of Type 2 diabetes is to this company, how deep our investment has been.
You need to turn yourself in and end this blockade.<eos> Is that why you're here, to run this plan by me?<eos> No, I'm here because I have a responsibility to speak to you like someone who understands this world in a way that you don't.<eos> The only way this doesn't end with us dead is you doing the right thing.<eos> Like you all did the right thing when you turned in that boy Finn?
Raven...<eos> I'm begging you, let me go to her.<eos> Open your mouth and hold out your tongue.<eos> I am the last Natblida, heir to Bekka Pramheda.<eos> I triumphed in the Conclave, and you are my subjects.
Open your mouth and hold out your tongue.<eos> I am the last Natblida, heir to Bekka Pramheda.<eos> I triumphed in the Conclave, and you are my subjects.<eos> I am the last Natblida, heir to Bekka Pramheda.<eos> I triumphed in the Conclave, and you are my...
- Yes.<eos> - No. You reign cannot begin until you...<eos> My reign has already begun.<eos> I am the last Natblida, heir to Bekka Pramheda.<eos> I triumphed in the Conclave, and you are my subjects.
Previously on "The 100"...<eos> I am the last Natblida, heir to Bekka Pramheda, and you are my subjects.
I ain't done nothin'!<eos> You're wasting your time, yo!<eos> Shit!<eos> What are you smiling about?<eos> Just thinkin' about when I first got here and all the shit that you put me through.
He may call again.<eos> We're tapping your calls on the mobile..even your landline.<eos> Thank you.<eos> But what is your plan?<eos> Is there a threat to Ronnie's life if you stay here?
Why will he do such a thing?<eos> Honestly, I've seen stranger cases than this in my career.<eos> But are you sure he's the one?<eos> Because I just don't get it.<eos> Although..since I got here, everyone pointed out.. ...that he's been missing from the moment you came here.
- Yeah.<eos> We pulled the security footage from the hospital.<eos> - I got ten men going over it right now.<eos> - Any leads?<eos> I was hoping you had something.
Oh, stop now.<eos> He is still her son-in-law.<eos> No, Bar's right.<eos> He doesn't deserve to be president.<eos> You could... all help me, actually.
Thank you.<eos> Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, my fellow Americans.<eos> One year ago, when I gave this address for the first time, it was during a very different period for our country.<eos> Our nation was recovering from a political scandal and a trade crisis with China.<eos> Before you stood a president no one had elected.
And I said to Walter...<eos> "You want to know what it's really like to live at my house?"<eos> And I gave that tree a good whack.<eos> And Walter cried out, but I kept on.<eos> I mean, you've never heard screams like the one coming from Walter as I chopped at that tree.
You keep killing high-profile businessmen and seizing their assets.<eos> - That's no...<eos> - You mean, traitors?<eos> Look, I am aware that they were plotting a coup, but that still doesn't...<eos> Yes, because you orchestrated it.
Monty's in trouble and he needs your help.<eos> Oh, please. We've been following him on Twitter.<eos> He made it very clear he's too good for us zoo folk.<eos> Monty may not have said it, but he loves you guys.<eos> Besides, you're family, and family's always there in a time of need.
I don't know where my girls are.<eos> The girls are with me.<eos> What are you talking about, where?<eos> I love you so much, and, you know, it's just... It's hard to share, you know?<eos> Sort of like how you feel about your LEGO pirate ship.
Mom?<eos> You're in on this?<eos> Maybe if you would call me more often, you would know me better.<eos> Russell, I know I make jokes about Jesse, but I love her.<eos> So, Flo and I thought you two should kiss and make up.
He came in with some questions.<eos> 147 of 'em to be exact.<eos> I feel like I've been hit by a truck loaded with Bibles.<eos> Big heavy ones with those thick covers.<eos> Always be ready to give answer as to why you believe and the reason for your hope.
She didn't start her class with a blessing. She didn't lead her students in prayer.<eos> No, all she did was answer a question, because that is what she gets paid to do.<eos> Now, Mr. Kane will insist loudly and often that faith isn't on trial here, but that is exactly what is on trial, the most basic human right of all, the right to believe.<eos> Mr. Kane's afraid.<eos> He's afraid that you, the jury, the touchstone of common sense, might not agree with his tortured interpretation of the Constitution, that you might understand that my client has rights, rights that trump his agenda, and that in realizing that
- Possibly. - Uh-huh.<eos> And I think it's gonna be more than just a weekend.<eos> She's thinking about moving back here.<eos> Great.<eos> 'Cause when you two are together, you are on the town nonstop and I'm just an afterthought.
Dre: Are you kidding me?<eos> Did they just walk out of here without saying goodbye?<eos> That's totally rude.<eos> At least he is.<eos> Hey, I-I thought you and him were cool.
When I was coming up, all you needed was a pair of black-leather pants and a denim vest. Didn't even need a shirt.<eos> That's why I moved to L.A.<eos> ‚ô™ You moved to L.A. because of that hit-and-run.<eos> This is not about me.<eos> You two are the ones trying to keep up with the Joneses.
I drive a prius.<eos> Of course you do.<eos> See, you can do that.<eos> Brothers cannot.<eos> We have to dress the part just to get the part that you already have.
Just us.<eos> Someday maybe I will.<eos> You are too beautiful not to have a husband.<eos> You're too kind.<eos> You should come to our house, all of you.
I believe that wives are born to get into fights.<eos> They're born fighters.<eos> And your wife is a wrestler, right?<eos> That's why she's hotheaded.<eos> You are the media, you are very powerful.
They're born fighters.<eos> And your wife is a wrestler, right?<eos> That's why she's hotheaded.<eos> You are the media, you are very powerful.<eos> You slammed me the last time.
Everything has an expiry date.<eos> For us, love lasts way beyond expiry dates.<eos> So, what does your wife have that we don't?<eos> No, madam.<eos> You're all great.
But it wasn't, was it?<eos> Did you let on about...?<eos> No fear.<eos> - Well, that's something, at least.<eos> You two know each other, do you?
Bye, Emi lovers!<eos> What?<eos> No, come on, don't be silly.<eos> She's not going to replace you.<eos> You're going to work together from now on.
That's what you are!<eos> A wicked prick!<eos> -Antonio!<eos> -You're wicked!<eos> -What are you laughing at?
Hey...<eos> What happened?<eos> Two hours ago,<eos> Gabriel broke up with me.<eos> And since you two are so close,
If I win, I walk out of here with him and you never see us again.<eos> You all agree?<eos> - Pick a number.<eos> - Doesn't matter.<eos> You choose.
A man by the name of Vandal Savage runs a secret operation out of it... a prison within a prison, if you will.<eos> I've heard of this Savage.<eos> He has no respect for my country's rich criminal traditions.<eos> So you'll help us?<eos> You men have no tattoos.
The happiest dance.<eos> After we have gone through a long suffering, then we are happy to go back and dance and to express ourselves.<eos> I studied here ten years ago with some colleagues, scientists from Vanuatu.<eos> For you, is it strange to imagine that someone would come here to work, to study how the volcano works, how it erupts?<eos> I'm very surprised to hear that you people are very interested in the volcano. Yeah.
Oh, we're gonna call this the Werner Herzog Highway.<eos> And what we're doing here is opening up a space for the cars... so we can come through with a full crew tomorrow morning... to recover the additional pieces of the hominid that we found just up on top there, on the eroding sediments.<eos> So, we'd like to pull the cars in as close as we can get so we can get all the equipment there.<eos> And we'll start an extraction process to pull that hominid out.<eos> How phenomenally lucky are we to have arrived now and you've found this 100,000-year-old human?
My work's on time. It's done right.<eos> It's done well.<eos> It's not fair, that's a fact.<eos> What's not fair is having the responsibility of a supervisor... - but not the title or the pay.<eos> Watching you two move on.
And why is that?<eos> Sir, the data changes so fast.<eos> The capsule changes.<eos> The weight and the landing zones are all changing, every day.<eos> I do my work, you attend these briefings, I have to start over.
We don't have the math figured out yet.<eos> Why is it she can't attend?<eos> Because she doesn't have clearance, Al.<eos> I cannot do my work effectively if I do not have all of the data and all of the information as soon as it's available.<eos> I need to be in that room, hearing what you hear.
Least I could do for helping me dodge a bullet.<eos> I'm sorry about this.<eos> These houses are yours to live in, but they are prison property.<eos> They will be treated with respect.<eos> As long as they are treated with respect, you will be as well.
Looks like Donna's mother's funeral went well.<eos> Odd choice to have an open casket for a gunshot suicide.<eos> Yep, I thought I wanted a family, but I love having no responsibilities here.<eos> I can get drunk whenever, sleep with anyone, and just hide in my house and avoid the world if I feel like it.<eos> Wow, that's great, and totally doesn't sound like symptoms of clinical depression. I heard you gentleman went to South Korea.
All good gardeners know some must die that others may grow.<eos> - But...<eos> - Patience, dear girl.<eos> In good time, all shall be revealed.<eos> In the meantime, you two must play your parts.
Then, Plato asks,<eos> "What would the prisoners do?"<eos> Would they, if they could, stone this man?<eos> Kill him rather than have their reality destroyed?<eos> What would you do?
Guns on the ground, both of you on your knees.<eos> Right now!<eos> Okay.<eos> Yep.<eos> You two just can't stop messing with my business.
I went to...<eos> I was...<eos> All those times you said the Beast showed up?<eos> Everything you said about frequencies.<eos> Where were you all those times?
You want me to put it on?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You won't die if you put it on.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> Or is it just that you don't want to put it on yourself?
Let me show you how to go for the throat.<eos> Liam, wait.<eos> We can still save Mason.<eos> Who's going to save you?<eos> What kind of werewolves are you?
- Ged-gedyah!<eos> - Ged-gedyah!<eos> Well, now that the mining permit's finally gone through,<eos> - we'll need them off our land.<eos> - I don't think you gentlemen have any idea what you're dealing with.
Should I check the upstairs?<eos> Yes, please.<eos> Henry here's going to freshen up.<eos> Clean hands, clean mind.<eos> I'm sure you're not one of those families hiding munitions from the war effort, but orders being what they are, it is my duty to check.
What about later that night?<eos> We assumed you wanted to process things with your friends.<eos> - So... - What?<eos> We took advantage of the fact that you were with your friends and your father was at my apartment.<eos> Wait, you two were...
A very small affair, as my fiance lost his first two wives.<eos> Line.<eos> 'In tragic circumstances.'<eos> 'Cut! '<eos> If Miss Fontaine would deign to learn her lines before coming on set, it would save us all a lot of time, which, as you know, means money.
Hardly Chekhov, I'm afraid.<eos> Sounds jolly good fun.<eos> Although I'm not sure Mrs McCarthy would approve.<eos> Oh, no!<eos> Why don't you see for yourselves?
What do you mean?<eos> One second, I'm standing here, next second, I'm in my ex's bed naked.<eos> Well, you're welcome.<eos> So, did it work?<eos> You two have sex?
What is this?<eos> What's going on here?<eos> What's going on with that?<eos> Excuse me!<eos> Pardon the intrusion, you Village People rejects, but one of you has stolen something that belongs to me.
Madam Senator, I assure you it's for your protection.<eos> I know your friend Sam Lane talks a lot of crap about the DEO, but we're here to help.<eos> The General told me that for all your big talk about monitoring aliens, you're the first one to let them in through the front door.<eos> I guess you forgot the part where I saved your ass.<eos> Mmm. For all I know, you all staged that little stunt.
I guess you forgot the part where I saved your ass.<eos> Mmm. For all I know, you all staged that little stunt.<eos> It's just like an alien.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> You're all the same.
Who said you have to do that?<eos> You're fired, get out.<eos> - Get her the fuck out!<eos> No, you can't do...<eos> - Richie, no, you can't do that to me.
Look, yesterday, I saw Emile.<eos> He came around the job around 2:00, asking for some money... and I gave it to him.<eos> What?<eos> He did something stupid with it?<eos> Well, that depends on what you think of as stupid.
Wouldn't you like to make Patrice happy and maybe... maybe get your sixth wedding off to a better start than the last five?<eos> Sharon: I just want to make sure you're prepared - to plead your own case.<eos> - [Handcuffs click] The state can provide you with a lawyer...<eos> I need help.<eos> And you need help.
- Guys, come on!<eos> This is bullshit!<eos> - No, it's not!<eos> Tamika told you where the gun was and then told Emile you were the person behind the murder of Rachel Gray, so he had to go, too.<eos> Listen to me, Sharon, this is all a terrific theory you've come up with that doesn't apply to me.
Nice.<eos> That's a good girl.<eos> You just stay there.<eos> You should really let me go.<eos> Or you're all gonna die tonight.
- So this is personal.<eos> It doesn't matter how they were chosen.<eos> They fitted what we were looking for.<eos> Isolated house, single daughter, wealth.<eos> These are parameters that you came up with.
"If there are poor among you, do not be selfish or greedy towards them."<eos> Uh, I think that's a Christian thing.<eos> It's the same damn book.<eos> We just got different prophets is all.<eos> Or I guess you're still waiting for yours to show up.
Hate will only bring more hate.<eos> Don't believe that everyone has a predetermined destiny.<eos> Your destiny is in your own hands.<eos> Boss, we found them on the seaside.<eos> You are not yet as good as Wu.
What do you think they're like?<eos> That's right.<eos> It's... I swear to you!<eos> Go to San Francisco. They're like, "Ah, we're offended."<eos> And you're like, "Yep."
And I know it's a great show.<eos> There's a lot of great shows.<eos> I can't see every show.<eos> I've never seen it.<eos> Do you ever lie?
- Yeah, you can still do our shows.<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> I don't know. I don't, you know...<eos> I mean, it's late night, it's just on the week days.<eos> I don't know 'cause you're writing all the time.
Listen, I had a very interesting conversation with Brandon this afternoon.<eos> He wanted to know if I would invest the $7,500 that he has left over from his hand money.<eos> He did?<eos> Why?<eos> It seems that he has been invited for the final callbacks for Juilliard, but he doesn't think he should even try because he doesn't think you could possibly afford it.
I don't care how many electoral votes he has, all right?<eos> To find a solution, a secret meeting is convened between the teams of both presidential candidates.<eos> Hayes men and Tilden men got together in a hotel in Washington and hammered out an agreement.<eos> There has to be some give and some take.<eos> We give you the presidency, and you pull out the troops.
Change you... into something else.<eos> - Now that I have your attention.<eos> We test to discern your discipline.<eos> Your area of concentration.<eos> It is what you are, and with the right guidance, you may safely rise to unknowable heights.
Well, he tried to at least.<eos> So, I fell for this professor.<eos> I know how it sounds, but I was young and... and he loved me.<eos> But then, well, he was married.<eos> You know how it is when you're that age.
Whoa!<eos> It would suck to have to spell that dumb name.<eos> Well, Rafe, welcome to hell.<eos> Back to the homework from last night.<eos> You all listened to the Drake and Future mixtape last night.
"Our turf"?<eos> Yeah, I mean, it's not fair the Dominicans get the shaded area in the yard.<eos> We're the ones low in melanin.<eos> I thought the whole point of our things was to break up gangs.<eos> If we're talking about turf, we're a gang, you're a gang, we're all gangbangers.
Let's bury 'em by the tree line and mark it.<eos> The Nazis giveth, the Sinclair taketh away.<eos> A walking tour of France with Sinclair.<eos> Should be fun.<eos> I'm sure you two will have a... good chat.
- He just ate some bad meat.<eos> - Did the bad meat give him that bruise?<eos> - Sharp eyes.<eos> - They have to be, these days.<eos> You're not smugglers.
- You mean, uh... Posing, like in classical art.<eos> And these ladies, they are very international.<eos> Open-minded.<eos> Creative.<eos> You know.
At least he believed in something.<eos> Like these brave souls...<eos> Madame fighting the Germans instead of licking their boots!<eos> Fighting?<eos> Who are you?
Martina...<eos> Guys... kitchen.<eos> Okay.<eos> You have to tell your dad the truth now.<eos> And you two have to shut up and let him.
Look.<eos> When you were born, I was in a bad marriage.<eos> And maybe I associate you with that.<eos> But then I met Alice, and I was in a happy marriage with this little boy who really needed me.<eos> It probably won't make you feel any better, but the mistakes I made with you made me a better father to Ethan.
So do you, secret sugar cereal eater.<eos> Yours is way worse than mine.<eos> Cigarettes were never part of a balanced breakfast.<eos> They were in the trailer park I grew up in.<eos> That was a great talk that you two had.
! You traitor!<eos> You did this!<eos> No. This is not my doing.<eos> Nor is it my fight.<eos> You've invited your own demise.
No, no, no, no! - This can't happen to me!<eos> - What should we do? !<eos> The only cure is "headectomy."<eos> You want us to cut off his head? !<eos> If you don't, he'll turn and he'll come after you.
What worm is this?<eos> The essence of his being.<eos> He has not yet taken another host but when he does, he will be just as powerful as before.<eos> A crimson worm.<eos> You might have told me.
Sorry.<eos> He's quite a guy, huh?<eos> Takes over my place, gives away my clothes, amongst other things.<eos> - Yeah, I heard.<eos> - Since when have you two been best buddies?
Come on, Lance, we got a Delta shuttle to catch.<eos> Sorry for your loss, AUSA Valdez.<eos> That phone wasn't the only piece of random evidence at Knox's apartment.<eos> There was a dress and a bracelet, a bra.<eos> You two were back together, huh?
He never did anything wrong.<eos> He is our father.<eos> And that is the end of it.<eos> You all sound like a bunch of Christians.<eos> I love our father as much as you do.
I love our father as much as you do.<eos> Who said I loved him, Ubbe?<eos> I said I admired him.<eos> He's Viking.<eos> And you are soft.
If you've got a problem with a man, you go to him.<eos> You don't take a bat to his car.<eos> I was 8 years old.<eos> I knew you lied about that window.<eos> Well, it looks like you two are in the right place.
Out all night with women.<eos> There were no women.<eos> Mary, the real reason I'm here is, we've been talking, you know, Duval, Otto, Alexa.<eos> We've decided that, uh, you're not gonna do your presentation today.<eos> You decided?
He'll fixate on the banner.<eos> Don't...<eos> I'm sorry, Otto.<eos> I almost missed my cue.<eos> You all know that Otto and I lost our parents when we were very young.
You're not from Prisoners' Rights.<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> Then go to hell.<eos> You're gonna help me find those other two escapees... who might be helping them, where they might be hiding.<eos> You three were on the run together, so you must have had some kind of plan.
-Everything. The labs... the offices, the hideouts, the deposits...<eos> we're moving everything.<eos> Boss, even the labs?<eos> They're well-guarded. There's no problem.<eos> Come on, don't you know what's going on at La Catedral?
-I told them to tell you--<eos> -Calm down. Don't worry about that.<eos> We'll fix that problem soon.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> [softly] In the meantime... I want you to move to the offices in Laureles.
I don't want to sit down!<eos> It's all right, it's all right.<eos> Can I see her?<eos> Is there someone who can look after the children?<eos> Where were you?
One metre, 80 or so.<eos> Fair hair. Wearing a dark suit.<eos> Where's Maigret, Lognon? I don't know, sir.<eos> Chief Inspector Lefors will be leading this investigation from now on.<eos> Now he's returned from Bordeaux, you will all report directly to him.
When Albert rang me he said that you and I had met.<eos> Yes.<eos> When?<eos> Ten years ago. I was working at a hotel in Dieppe.<eos> You were on holiday there.
- Look, I don't wanna go down this route any more than you do, but at least we'll have our bases covered.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Imagine a duel. Me and Conway.<eos> Now, Conway has a powerful gun, a search engine.<eos> And it's powerful because with it, he can tell what you think, what you want, where you are and who you are.
Unless you're going to nominate an NRA member.<eos> - You know we can't do that.<eos> - Jacobs was unpredictable.<eos> This time we're not taking any chances.<eos> If you bring the government to a standstill, we're gonna make this election about the NRA.
- You've met with him, Macallan.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - So, can he be trusted?<eos> - I honestly can't say.<eos> He understands the risks even better than you do.
They're going to fight this tooth and nail.<eos> Well, of course they are.<eos> And... and the chances are the legislation won't pass.<eos> Oh, it'll pass.<eos> Because you are going to push it until it goes through both houses and gets on the books.
A president should know his constituents.<eos> And the Internet is the best tool for that.<eos> Now, I've met thousands of people and shaken a lot of hands, but I can't meet everyone.<eos> So this is my way of listening to millions of you.<eos> Now, it's only fair if I get to know you better, you should get to know me better.

Now, what do y'all think of that?<eos> I'll take $500, sir.<eos> And I'll give it.<eos> All right, all right, all right, all right.<eos> Now, you are all men of refinement and discretion, but why'd y'all come here today?
This can't be.<eos> You do this next shot right, now.<eos> Take your time.<eos> Nice and steady.<eos> If you niggers interfere, we'll kill you!
"Querida Anna,<eos> I write, as promised, a few weeks after my departure.<eos> My return to France was difficult.<eos> But I try to survive.<eos> Enclosed is my letter to parents of Frantz, which, I know, you can not delete my crime, but it will help you understand my presence among you.
We spent wonderful moments,<eos> I did go Paris and all sites<eos> of which Frantz had told us.<eos> Yesterday at the Louvre, Manet saw the box.<eos> I would love to you were here to share these moments.
Not a game we play.<eos> I'm super worried you think we do, terrified.<eos> I feel like we're playing it right now.<eos> Great "dumb cop," great "smart cop."<eos> You two need to get realistic.
He loved his family too much.<eos> But... They would not listen.<eos> We understand.<eos> Do you?<eos> Are you two mothers?
-Uh-huh.<eos> They're perfect.<eos> -Hi, there.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> Now I don't know much, but I know you must be Sol and Bud.
Your mommy gave you this company.<eos> Oh, stop it.<eos> You're being so mean to each other.<eos> I hate this.<eos> You're friends.
You rocked the shit out of some of those wigs we got you.<eos> You're right.<eos> It was not all bad. But it was pretty fuckin' bad.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> You girls were so good to me during that nightmare.
I love you too, Tina Marie.<eos> As I live and breathe, Grace Hanson is in the house.<eos> Let's give her a hand.<eos> And of course none of this could be happening tonight without my dearest, my heart, Frankie.<eos> You all mean so much to me.
I suppose I could dust off the old peasant skirt. No.<eos> Not that.<eos> No.<eos> Never that.<eos> Um, I was thinking since you're not doing anything, I could come crash with you.
What's up, Bar?<eos> Nothing. Just--<eos> I don't know, I don't think Wally likes me too much.<eos> Well, we need to fix that.<eos> I mean, you been so busy running between alternate realities, you two haven't had a chance to spend any time together.
You fuckers.<eos> How dare you?<eos> That magnificent woman counted on you and you losers let her down. Yeah, I got to call you back.<eos> Something amazing is happening.<eos> All you fucking cared about was your stupid, bad selves.
You're here for von K√∂nig, aren't you?<eos> - Yeah. Do you know where he is?<eos> - He is where you say.<eos> Look, I'm Kreisau, like von K√∂nig.<eos> I have nothing to hide from you, and you have nothing you need to hide from me.
Now, I wasn't given details, but apparently he's in possession of something far more important than even he is.<eos> So until we hear otherwise, we stay on orders.<eos> Captain, you said you wanted to get back home, and going after K√∂nig ain't the shortest distance between here and there.<eos> I do want to get home, Dix.<eos> I don't like this any more than you do.
Yeah, sure.<eos> Train is coming.<eos> Okay.<eos> Get ready.<eos> And you think we are crazy.
Oh, just because you dated me for 5 minutes does not make you an expert. Ha!<eos> The fact that you dumped me after 5 minutes kind of makes my case for me, don't you think?<eos> I'm at work.<eos> You guys are it, Jana.<eos> You two have that... that thing that we all want, and everyone seems to know it but you.
What if I am?<eos> I need to self-quarantine.<eos> We can come with you.<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> You stay here, stay safe.
The doctor has quarantined himself in his lab, because of how close he worked with the boy.<eos> He'll be fine.<eos> We're still in good hands.<eos> Yeah, I'm sure you're right.<eos> You two need to smile more.
Previously, on amc's "the walking dead."<eos> We can help each other.<eos> We're doin' fine.<eos> Are you?
Tall walls.<eos> People in here probably forget. What the corpses look like...<eos> What they smell like.<eos> Now, we were gonna kill them for you, To remind you of the service we can provide,<eos> And you cleaned up the mess yourselves.
No, you didn't.<eos> Not so much.<eos> We're having stew.<eos> That's right...<eos> You two haven't formally met, have you?
Seriously.<eos> Screw you.<eos> Check this out.<eos> The Saviors have gone out into the world and fought the dead and come back with some really good stuff.<eos> Some of that stuff can be yours if you work hard and play by the rules.
You have to keep her safe.<eos> It isn't just you.<eos> It sure looks like it.<eos> A lot of places came together after the world fell apart.<eos> Maybe you're both from one of those places.
I won't be a part of changing that.<eos> And maybe we can build on that.<eos> Not with these people!<eos> When they turn on us... and they will... that blood is gonna be on your hands!<eos> But maybe you're both used to that.
So I feel like I need to take one of those tickets.<eos> Let me be clear.<eos> Thanks again for taking the kids tonight.<eos> [Chuckles] Of course.<eos> Mm-hmm. I love that you two are making this Valentine's Day special.
Aw, poor Jessica.<eos> I feel so bad for her.<eos> I know.<eos> Lice is the worst.<eos> I'm sure that's why you guys agreed that it's better for you to come here so you don't get it yourself.
He bought it! He bought the computer!<eos> Uh, what?<eos> No!<eos> It was her idea to do the website.<eos> Wait. Are you saying you're the compu-teasers?
He's really having fun.<eos> He's a good dad.<eos> Whoo-hoo-hoo!<eos> Handstand!<eos> Okay, now you two have a breath-holding contest.
I have to say I was surprised you wanted to take down Deidre, too.<eos> I thought you were friends.<eos> We power walk together, sure, but I can't be friends with someone who puts their own needs above the association.<eos> Whoa!<eos> You two are pulling the strings?
Really?<eos> Why does he get to choose?<eos> _<eos> _<eos> You will all drink what Evan decides, and you will like it!
We got them microchipped...<eos> So the savings should kick in in about two months.<eos> Out!<eos> Get out!<eos> You two are hopeless!
I understand.<eos> We also took one of the scooters of the victims, one wrist computer and one tank up with us.<eos> So we have those for you and then we have a video of the recovery.<eos> So we want to give them to you.<eos> So you have taken both bodies up?
If I can get the women from the fraud case to testify he dosed them personally...<eos> I think we can convince a jury.<eos> That's all I need to know.<eos> Thank you... thank you.<eos> You know, I've devoted my whole life to healing, but healing is more than finding the right medication, more than establishing the right treatment program.
Hello, all.<eos> So, Bob, about our date Saturday night, which better be happening if one of us knows what's good for him...<eos> Well, Saturday's a pretty busy night here.<eos> Hey, why don't Stella and I run the bar?<eos> We can make some money, and you two can go on your date.
Me and the missus here, we love drugs.<eos> Yum-yum.<eos> Wow.<eos> I did not know that.<eos> Um, how about we get some champagne, and we'll find out what other secrets you two have?
Great timing.<eos> Anyway, Bob wants to tell you something, but he feels uncomfortable saying it.<eos> This is true.<eos> You got to stop worrying about being vanilla.<eos> So go out, find her, do something bold, and rock her world, 'cause the truth of it is, you got a good marriage, the kind of marriage you should be proud of.
- Being our daughters.<eos> That ends now.<eos> From now on, we're not parents and kids.<eos> We are adults roommates living together.<eos> You need to clean up, shop for your own food, put gas in the car.
In a few hours, the hype becomes reality when Oasis take to the stage...<eos> John, describe the scene for us.<eos> I do often think, "What was it all about?"<eos> When we got to Knebworth, we'd only just become rock stars.<eos> And I said to Coyle and Phil, "You're getting on that helicopter,"
- Crap.<eos> Hey, uh, you're home early.<eos> - Nice to see you, too.<eos> - We got to get going.<eos> Uh, since when do you two hang out together so much?
Hey, uh, you're home early.<eos> - Nice to see you, too.<eos> - We got to get going.<eos> Uh, since when do you two hang out together so much?<eos> Oh, my God, are you two...
Oh...<eos> This sucks.<eos> Gerald's gonna see the billboard.<eos> He takes Sunset on his way to the community garden.<eos> I can't believe you two idiots roped me into this.
- Father Malick to you.<eos> - We're here to talk<eos> - about Megan Halshford.<eos> - Sounds like a whore!<eos> Then again, you're all whores.
You get me that and we have a deal. You understand?<eos> But then again, he wasn't the risk-taker that I am.<eos> You have the day to deliver.<eos> Is it official?<eos> Are you two going steady?
Wells, as a parent, believe me, I have nothing but sympathy for what you're going through.<eos> Listen to me closely when I say to you, we got a lot of fires burning at the same time, and if we all work together, we just might be able to put them out.<eos> Let Henry take care of your daughter.<eos> Me and Iris will handle this Girder situation, but you and Cisco are the scientists.<eos> You're the only one who can bring Barry back from wherever the hell he is right now.
Ramon, can you just please... have you ever worked with a tool before?<eos> I'm working with one now.<eos> Are you ready?<eos> One, two, and...<eos> I don't know what's more annoying, being in that thing or listening to you two arguing about it.
Ahh.<eos> Y'all want to find who clocked the dentist?<eos> You've got to look into who would want to muscle into his territory.<eos> We need names.<eos> You assume I know drug dealers.
Aigoo..<eos> Since that day I haven't been back to the mountain.<eos> My shop is losing money because of it!<eos> How can you call that evidence?<eos> You don't believe me...
And take this... check whatever you want to.<eos> My name is Daman.<eos> Since when I am telling you that I am from Mumbai.<eos> But none of you listened to me.<eos> You all bashed me.
I'll tell your brother the thing you never could, the reason you're really down here.<eos> Looks like my evil twin's out on patrol. Great.<eos> Then let's find that key and get the hell out of here.<eos> Top drawer, just like at home.<eos> You two are so alike.
I don't like it any more than you do.<eos> I told Jack we'd come check this place out and then we'd have a discussion.<eos> I can't believe you suggested the idea of building a fucking appliance.<eos> I didn't, okay? I pitched it as an example of what not to do and the fucking sales guys ran with it.<eos> I didn't want to go to enterprise. You were the ones who said it would be fine.
- You know who!<eos> The girls at my school!<eos> They all broke up with their boyfriends, and now they got you to go along with them!<eos> This is a time when women and girls have to stand together. So then it's true!<eos> You're all snakes in the grass... every last one of you!
The first step towards healing is admitting you've got a problem.<eos> Well, you've got a fat pussy, and you should go and fuck kill yourself! Sorry. I think I'm in the wrong place.<eos> Make no mistake. I want to be very upset. However, as a community, we have all decided that people have the right to protest the National Anthem.<eos> Correct. But they did so peacefully and without malice towards others. This was an attack on us.<eos> I am in a PC pretzel here because if I say they can't protest even though you protested, and the only difference is their protest included physical gestures, then I'm body-shaming!

We got sales, manufacturing, design, assembly, logistics teams, they're all ready to go.<eos> All of them on the payroll, all of them here to build me a box.<eos> I have a deal, in principle, with Maleant to buy the box.<eos> The second that we deliver a product that meets those specs, we are cashing checks!<eos> And you are the only four people in this building that are fighting me on it!
I can't wait to see the look on that AAR prick's face when we come in there and gut him like a--<eos> - Is he okay?<eos> - He's going to be fine.<eos> Welcome, men and ladies of Endframe.<eos> Rather than incestuously promoting the same faces from within, you represent fresh blood, new ideas.
Nothing left. You have your stash, but at the rate you're going through it, man, that's gonna last, what, a few weeks?<eos> Maximum. And, yeah, you can find a substitute, sure, but that crave's gonna get worse and worse and worse and your sister needs her family.<eos> Familia.<eos> Yeah, they need it. You let your sister go for one week without it, you're gonna pray she turns just so you can kill her.<eos> You need oxy.
But that ain't me anymore.<eos> I'm now the proprietor/spokesperson/ number one customer of Whale World.<eos> At Whale World, families come together to admire the fine female form of the majestic killer whale.<eos> It's educational.<eos> Join us in the Splash Zone. You and your little ones are gonna get moist.
You moved the infected onto the floor.<eos> Yes, I contained the problem.<eos> What was the problem?<eos> You.<eos> You were.
- I'm not.<eos> Well, we need to talk to him.<eos> He doesn't need to talk to you.<eos> We're not leaving the hotel.<eos> You're not leaving the hotel.
Spanakopita?<eos> - This has nothing to do with Ana.<eos> Here you go, sir.<eos> - I'll get it!<eos> - You two are b'thumping. Now you do whatever she says?
- Olive.<eos> You wanna use olive oil.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> Let me do this.<eos> You'll burn the place to the ground.
So you'll give Elefante a good review?<eos> Oh, no, I can't do that.<eos> I waited over two hours to be served.<eos> The ambience was terrible.<eos> You two were screaming all night.
You know, there was a time, not so long ago, when it could've been a literal fire.<eos> But as discussed, those days are gone.<eos> Unless...<eos> All right, forget it.<eos> You people are useless.
[all] Hi, Simon.<eos> My rock bottom was when I actually woke up under a rock.<eos> Can't get lower than that.<eos> Come on!<eos> You people call yourself drunks?
- Pass.<eos> But it doesn't mean that I trust her, and I certainly don't trust anyone else.<eos> Oh, in other words, you have no friends.<eos> On principle.<eos> I could make what rises to your low standards of a friend any time I want. Sure you could.
I can't sell my shares at Pied Piper.<eos> Not now. Wouldn't it cover your outstanding debts?<eos> Of course.<eos> But they could potentially be worth billions.<eos> Yes, and how do you see that playing to people who are being priced out of their homes by rich tech people? Have either of you been on a jury?
But we're transferring to AWS now, and I'm afraid you can't come.<eos> Oh, I'm pathetic?<eos> I'd rather have a bunch of fake friends than be best friends with a fucking metal box.<eos> Can't you two see?<eos> You're each other's best friends.
Can't you two see?<eos> You're each other's best friends.<eos> Fuck you, Jared.<eos> Yeah. Jinx.<eos> You owe each other a friendship.
Our intention is simply to transition you into a more appropriate role within the company, one with less oversight of day-to-day operations.<eos> You're putting me on the fucking roof?<eos> You could always choose to move on, Gavin.<eos> Up to you. I built this company with my bare hands in my fucking garage.<eos> Where were you when I was doing that?
Well, uh, you are certainly more than qualified to be our new head of PR.<eos> Laurie thinks you're great.<eos> Um, to be honest, we could use the help.<eos> All the media stuff has been pretty overwhelming, especially lately.<eos> - If Marissa Mayer can do it, so can you.
Stop wasting my time, 'cause I'll have you here on a plane in five hours sucking my dick!<eos> What'd he say? I believe they've eaten the mem'bries. - Oh, dear!<eos> - Oh, dear!<eos> Here you see our Falcon 9 full-thrust rockets.<eos> They are actually able to take off into space and land safely back on earth for reuse. Well, I certainly want to thank you all for joining our tour today. You've been a wonderful group.
Maybe we can help you get to Mars sooner. I'm not sure if you know our friend, Heidi. She's really smart and really funny.<eos> Like... how funny?<eos> ‚ô™ Gonna take a lot to take me away from you ‚ô™<eos> ‚ô™ There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do ‚ô™ Out of the way, 'member?<eos> You better 'member, if you know what's good for yous.
!<eos> Get off that computer!<eos> Mom, we were just using it to look at the news.<eos> I don't care. I said no computers!<eos> You kids are addicted to the Internet!
You forgot or skipped the sexual revolution.<eos> Just kidding, no.<eos> I'm very touched.<eos> Really. Truly.<eos> But now I want to say something that was left out, that you didn't say, but I'm going to.
It was true love.<eos> Augusto passed away, six years now.<eos> He was my partner for more than 30 years.<eos> He was a very good man.<eos> We never got married because... I think some of you know, he was already married.
He's 60-65.<eos> - He's not my type.<eos> - He's not your type.<eos> He still looks good.<eos> Do you remember why we came here tonight?
Rivanildo.<eos> Good afternoon, Rivanildo.<eos> - And your name Diogo, right?<eos> - Diego.<eos> Diego, you brought some mattresses over to the building.
Mom, how are you dealing with this situation?<eos> Well, I'm pissed.<eos> Don't you think you're stressing out about all this?<eos> No. I said I'm pissed.<eos> You're the ones getting stressed out.
This won't go anywhere.<eos> There are things that don't go anywhere, but if it causes you one single headache when I publish these documents I'll be happy.<eos> Ms. Clara, I don't know if it's in your best interests, or in those of your lawyer, to tangle with our legal department.<eos> Well, based on the size of your table, your legal department must be huge.<eos> You people are complete bastards.
How did you get his identity?<eos> We have it. That's it.<eos> I can't say how we got it.<eos> Personally, I don't even know.<eos> Why don't you interview him yourselves?
It means it's far more aggressive than it presented in the imaging.<eos> It means it's far more aggressive than it presented in the imaging.<eos> Right.<eos> This tumor isn't benign.<eos> So you're saying it's cancer?
See?<eos> Fixed.<eos> It's about time!<eos> We leave at 2:00!<eos> You leave at 2:00.
The train will be departing soon.<eos> Thank you for visiting Westworld.<eos> I always thought I could play some small part in that grand tradition.<eos> And for my pains... I got this... a prison of our own sins.<eos> 'Cause you don't want to change.
The train is now departing.<eos> Thank you for visiting Westworld.<eos> And the people they will decide to become.<eos> Welcome to Westworld.<eos> And we'll have all those things that you have always enjoyed... Surprises and violence.
She's been erratic, emotional for weeks now.<eos> Maybe it's the Jimmy stuff, I don't know.<eos> You say anything to Boden yet?<eos> No. Why?<eos> You two are out there on the streets alone.
That was my brother's cause.<eos> Not my own.<eos> So what is your cause?<eos> Finding someplace safe to disappear.<eos> I spent months moving my Emperor from one hiding place to the next, and you still found us.
Sorry about Maureen.<eos> Babe, the first time you brought me home to meet your family, you said, "I'm sorry about Maureen."<eos> Let's just take that as a given.<eos> She's just like my dad... no filter.<eos> Well, speaking your mind is a McCord family trait that you all share.
So I think you have to forgive that 17-year-old boy, who was young and thoughtless.<eos> If for no other reason, you'll need the practice to forgive Jason someday when he does something like that.<eos> I think your dad did call for a reason.<eos> Not to ask for help.<eos> I think he needed to know that you two were ending on a good note.
And that's why nobody should talk about anything to anybody.<eos> Back to work, people.<eos> Damona...<eos> I want do this.<eos> I want to get out ahead of the gossip mill and let you all know that I will be getting back together with my ex-wife, Tiffany.
What are you doing?<eos> Okay, I think I may have misread,<eos> "that body belongs to both of us."<eos> Good morning, everyone!<eos> I'm speaking loudly so you can all hear me over the vast gap in our status.
9:40?<eos> I was getting ready for bed, talking to Allison.<eos> And 10:30?<eos> Talking to Allison!<eos> So you're saying Allison is my stress trigger?
Oh, good.<eos> More.<eos> I just don't understand why she'd want to make me look stupid in front of everyone.<eos> Well, you know how when people are good friends, they'll often participate in some light to moderate joshing?<eos> So you're saying Damona's prank was a sign of friendship?
Kara, what am I supposed to do?<eos> I know exactly where Max is.<eos> I'm sorry you have to lie.<eos> It's not just the lying.<eos> It's everything that you and the DEO are doing with Max.
Now, I appreciate that you are trying to cure her, but at this moment, can you guarantee me that the public is safe?<eos> Can you guarantee that any of us are safe?<eos> No.<eos> Citizens of National City, this is Cat Grant, live from Catco Plaza.<eos> As you all know, I have been Supergirl's most outspoken champion.
Supergirl's the target.<eos> If anything can reverse the red Kryptonite effect on your sister, this should do it.<eos> It better.<eos> Good luck. I mean that.<eos> As you all know, I have been Supergirl's most outspoken champion.
Yes.<eos> I don't want it to come.<eos> _<eos> Do you think that he'll be ready to come home soon?<eos> I think your son has gotten very good at knowing what you want to hear.
They have nothing but love in their hearts for you.<eos> Good.<eos> I'm so grateful to be a part of something where healing and forgiveness are so important.<eos> That's why Steve put me in charge.<eos> You may have known him longer, but I have The Gift.
Good.<eos> I'm so grateful to be a part of something where healing and forgiveness are so important.<eos> That's why Steve put me in charge.<eos> You may have known him longer, but I have The Gift.<eos> Oh, you can inspire the faithful, but you don't have what I have.
When you can beat me.<eos> Hank Henshaw or J'onn J'onzz, or whatever you wanna call him gave me a home.<eos> A purpose.<eos> I served him with honor, and I'm proud of that.<eos> You're the ones who should be ashamed of yourselves.
Funny.<eos> She said the same thing to me once.<eos> Here's what I say to that.<eos> Aah!<eos> Once you two are dead, I can finally give that little blonde moppet,
I know. I was myself.<eos> Mostly.<eos> And how did yourself feel about that?<eos> The morning meeting was to begin 16 seconds ago.<eos> You people were more punctual when you were drones.
- You think Nick did it?<eos> Hey, I just confirmed, he's not in class<eos> - and no one's seen him.<eos> - Then where the hell is he?<eos> I swear to God, you people are incompetent.
How's your face?<eos> Why did you hit me?<eos> What?<eos> You had a helmet on. Did you have to hit us so hard?<eos> Hey, you wanted it to look good.
Good things come in big packages.<eos> You can touch my silly point with your fine leg any time.<eos> Your middle stump is very long.<eos> The stitches on your balls seem quite nice.<eos> I'm sure you had something to do with this.
-Madras.<eos> -The nympha become butterflies.<eos> Interesting that you use the word "nympha."<eos> If you're going to flog that old nymphomaniac joke, forget it.<eos> Be that as it may, whatever mania you girls subscribe to, you seem to be of the quizzing persuasion.
I think it's working.<eos> Is he alive?<eos> Yeah. He's breathing.<eos> What happened?<eos> Who are you?
When we step into the arena, we don't always step out.<eos> Not so noble now, Chief Lord.<eos> They're called hard targets for a reason.<eos> Jesus.<eos> For the first time you're hunting something as smart as you are.
Found Sofia.<eos> Fuck.<eos> At least we know where they're going.<eos> They're called hard targets for a reason.<eos> First time you're hunting something as smart as you are.
They lost us when we went in that cave, right?<eos> And they found you two when you went outside with the rubies.<eos> We never even had a chance, then.<eos> We don't.<eos> But you do.
There's two of us.<eos> - Capsticks.<eos> - It's beer they want, woman, not a grammar lesson.<eos> Ned Shaw, I'm the engineer.<eos> You all work for me now.
Over here we can have the music room.<eos> A grand piano for when we have recitals in the evening.<eos> Oh, out there is the kitchen/garden, with formal lawns leading down to a tennis court. Is that grand enough for you, Duchess?<eos> You're mad sometimes.<eos> Wherever you two lay your heads, that's my dream home.
Oh, don't play the dutiful son.<eos> It doesn't convince me.<eos> You never truly cared for him.<eos> You never cared for anyone.<eos> You stand between me and everything I want.
- You pay me what you can afford.<eos> As long as I hear something rattle, that'll do.<eos> All the while he's living here, he's not who he's claimed to be.<eos> It's like something out of a penny novel, rich man in a pauper's coat.<eos> Who are you two discussing?
Well, we'll see about that, won't we?<eos> Mrs Quaintain, why do I get the feeling you're issuing a challenge to me?<eos> I will not be at the beck and call of a man again.<eos> Ever.<eos> What are you two still hanging around for?
- The word of a gentleman.<eos> Well, I'm a gentleman, too.<eos> I don't believe that my word is any better than hers.<eos> But if that's what it takes to convince you, I'll vouch for her.<eos> - You're all swagger, aren't you?
Just for today, that's all.<eos> Just a day... or so.<eos> But I can assure you that it is temporary and will be rectified as soon as possible.<eos> It's no use looking to me.<eos> - I know as much as all you do.
Thank you.<eos> And my sword?<eos> Your weapons will be on the boat.<eos> Oh, well... so much for the great Luna, the Savior of those in need.<eos> You don't want saving.
Was that a wolf?<eos> They're government experiment wolves.<eos> Yeah, they're pumped with GMOs, and they are massive, huge animals.<eos> They kill for pleasure and their fangs are huge.<eos> And they leave their kill so that you see it, so that you know that you are the one that is being hunted.
I just talked to him a few hours ago.<eos> -What were you talking about?<eos> -That we...<eos> We had a meeting. We have several projects underway...<eos> -How was it you knew each other?
I always have been.<eos> And I always will be.<eos> Well, um...<eos> Okay then. I'm gonna go.<eos> Uh... you two have a great night.
I don't know.<eos> They came to my apartment and told me to come.<eos> Well, I thought you'd like to see<eos> Dr. Benning's work in action.<eos> I know you two were close.
We dug a little deeper.<eos> It turns out Dr. Railly was confirmed dead at the CDC by our own personnel... so you can't be her.<eos> I am Cassandra Railly.<eos> Are you aware that entering a military base under false pretense is currently punishable by death?<eos> Now, tell me who you are.
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Cole, but I've spoken to Adler.<eos> Your tethers were caught in a perpetual slingshot sequence.<eos> That is why you splintered into the same day repeatedly.<eos> Time had nothing to do with it.<eos> It was our broken machine that you failed, once again, to undo.
If she decides to run again, there's only one way out.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> Sure, no problem.<eos> Um, make yourself at home, Mei Ling.<eos> I am headed out, but you two have fun.
Incredible!<eos> They really didn't hold back at all!<eos> Wow!<eos> Amazing!<eos> Might you fine people be the Straw Hat crew?
Wow!<eos> Such fitting outfits for such incredible pirates!<eos> Hey, are you really giving these to us? !<eos> Yes indeed.<eos> You are VIP customers here, after all.
Holy cow!<eos> It's all gold!<eos> It's made entirely of gold.<eos> Gorgeous!<eos> Who're you kids? !
I cannot possibly trust you people-ehhhh!<eos> So all of you get away from my safe this instant-ehhh!<eos> We can't!<eos> What an insolent tongue!<eos> Then you people must be allies with the thieves-amasu!
Tesoro!<eos> Let go of her...right now!<eos> Laugh, Straw Hat.<eos> Or do you still have faith?<eos> You people are nothing but trash that lost my gamble!
I'll never be able to do sports.<eos> I just want to pick something simple I could bang out quick.<eos> Yeah, or maybe thinking you can't do sports is what's holding you back from doing sports.<eos> Hey, you've already got an athlete.<eos> I don't know why you two are always trying to turn your other two loser kids into me.
I dragged you up here.<eos> And let me be very clear.<eos> The residency program at Angels Memorial is second to none, especially the emergency department.<eos> And why do you think that is?<eos> Yes, you are an integral part of that, but it is bigger than you.
I drive fast.<eos> Once we study the rocket schematics, we'll figure out where the problem lies, and then Happy'll take over.<eos> Should be a quick fix.<eos> We'll be out of your hair, and you can launch.<eos> Well, I have to say, you're a lot easier to work with than our traditional Homeland liaison.
What is this?<eos> She's in shock.<eos> Just plug it in.<eos> Okay.<eos> Scorpion, you will sabotage the launch you were assigned today.
Now, if we're gonna help you, we need to know what you remember from last night.<eos> I already told you, I don't remember much.<eos> We should also be concerned about what the guy on the recording knows.<eos> Like... like how I dropped my keys.<eos> Well, you two were both outside, so maybe they hacked into satellite imagery, or had access to it, or know someone who has access to it.
- and help you.<eos> - Walter, you're in a box with a bomb!<eos> She can't do this on her own!<eos> Okay?<eos> I'm gonna stay, and you got to take cover. Now go!
He was huge.<eos> Uh, not that you're short,<eos> - because you're not.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> How long have you two been together?
My visions revealed things I never could have known, took me places I never could have found on my own.<eos> It may seem that way, but then they wouldn't call it sacred disease if it wasn't special.<eos> Uh, this wasn't just kooks.<eos> Sir Isaac Newton was said to be afflicted by it. Hmm.<eos> I believe that you were capable of seeing patterns and making connections that normal people can't because your brain was filling in the blanks between your subconscious and the conscious.
I've got a daughter like that. I don't see her anymore.<eos> Woman 1: I don't like how he called the cops dirty.<eos> Man 1: Rich people think they can do whatever they want.<eos> Man 2: I am open-minded, but DNA doesn't lie.<eos> Are you or any of your family members in the law enforcement profession?
I didn't look.<eos> Thank you, Gilbert.<eos> You're gonna make a great mayor.<eos> - How you doing, Tim?<eos> - Just fine, Judge. How are you?
I'm glad he didn't.<eos> How come you speak Catalan?<eos> My husband was from Barcelona.<eos> I lived there for years.<eos> - Are you from Barcelona?
Help me!<eos> Hurry, come inside!<eos> If it's impossible to find that document, why not make a new one?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> You know the law.
You know.<eos> I think the situation has affected us all.<eos> You can't be serious.<eos> I've never been more serious.<eos> You don't know me.
But I do.<eos> You won't let yourself be loved.<eos> Why not?<eos> Don't tell me you did all this just to have me as a reward.<eos> You're a good man.
What's the play?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> We should maybe keep moving so they don't clock us.<eos> Farley, I'm just... I'm just starting to think I'm just an old fool.<eos> No, you're good people, Mr. B. Letting me work the bond off like this.
Farley, I'm just... I'm just starting to think I'm just an old fool.<eos> No, you're good people, Mr. B. Letting me work the bond off like this.<eos> You want me to drive around the block?<eos> How about we just go pick up Jacob?<eos> Whatever you say, Boss.
Yeah.<eos> I'm looking for Marius Josepovitch.<eos> You mean Josepovich?<eos> Good. You do know him.<eos> W-who are you?
- Ready?<eos> - Ready.<eos> Mr. Greenburg?<eos> Hold on.<eos> Hey, you called me.
The British.<eos> Jesus. Just how big does this club get?<eos> That's up to the President.<eos> The question is, what's he going to do about it?<eos> Okay, what would you do?
- Yeah.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> That woman who just went in... She got here two hours after you put my name on the list.<eos> So tell your friend, next time, limit himself to misdemeanors.<eos> You said you'd check on him?
A blue Jeep registered to this address.<eos> - I think you've made a mistake.<eos> - I think I haven't.<eos> What organization is this?<eos> A private one, and you're trespassing.
Oh, they're all in Raqqa, or wherever, bringin' on the end of the world over there with their goats!<eos> If you stop pushing back against them here, every minute, if you are that stupid, what do you get?<eos> Boom! That's what you get!<eos> Madame President-elect, I hope you're listening, and if you are, hear me now.<eos> You brought this down on us.
You're not saying he was heading toward me.<eos> We just don't know.<eos> Thank God he never reached his destination.<eos> But this was a man who hated the US government.<eos> You are the premiere symbol of that government in New York at the moment.
Same as before.<eos> I want to talk to him.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Alone.<eos> You stay here.
You know what they're calling it--<eos> "Escape From New York."<eos> Because while New Yorkers were dealing with this terrible attack, the president-elect fled to a "secure location."<eos> Still undisclosed.<eos> General, you were in the Pentagon on 9/11.
You couldn't talk Andrew out of anything, not once his mind was made up.<eos> And once he graduated, he served three tours in Iraq?<eos> Two full tours.<eos> He was killed just at the beginning of his third.<eos> And by then, you had come out against the war.
Popcorn!<eos> Cotton candy!<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Sure you have the right seat?<eos> You're Saul.
Cotton candy!<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Sure you have the right seat?<eos> You're Saul.<eos> I am. Who are you?
Sure you have the right seat?<eos> You're Saul.<eos> I am. Who are you?<eos> Amir.<eos> You and I have a friend in common.
Have you been inking?<eos> No. No!<eos> I just... I just thought that... That...<eos> That you, of all people, would understand. I me...<eos> You lost a child.
So I brought him into our home because... Because I can't go through that again.<eos> I-I can't lose another one.<eos> I want you to listen to me a second.<eos> I want you to listen and really try to hear.<eos> What you go through, every parent goes through.
I-I can't lose another one.<eos> I want you to listen to me a second.<eos> I want you to listen and really try to hear.<eos> What you go through, every parent goes through.<eos> Here is you, and here is your child.
Please, sit down.<eos> The fact is, I asked you here to pick your brain.<eos> - About?<eos> - Iran.<eos> And the contingency plans we need if, as you've suggested, they are cheating on the nuclear deal.
So there's no confusion, yes, he was very much involved in this... let's call it a misunderstanding.<eos> In Saul's defense, it's easy to get things wrong in this business.<eos> That doesn't mean you get rewarded for it.<eos> If you don't mind my saying, I'm impressed.<eos> Whatever you think, I'm not an ideologue.
What?<eos> At Children's Services to see your daughter.<eos> How do you know about that?<eos> Hey!<eos> Who the fuck are you? !
Where does this leave us, George?<eos> I was just thinking about that.<eos> We're down to Saul Berenson, that is if you're willing to offer him a deal in exchange for his testimony.<eos> More than willing. Is there a legal basis for it?<eos> As long as you go through proper channels at Justice, the National Security Division.
Really?<eos> It happens.<eos> So what do you want?<eos> I wasn't satisfied with the way our meeting went yesterday.<eos> I felt you weren't, either, and so, those names you requested for cabinet positions-- I have them now.
Maybe you should get some rest.<eos> We got hit...<eos> Look at what I've done to him.<eos> - And what did Captain Keane do?<eos> - You didn't do this.
Me?<eos> Elizabeth Keane?<eos> Gold Star mom?<eos> You are.<eos> You're a bad dream.
Ma'am, my orders are to put you in this vehicle.<eos> Now get in.<eos> Okay.<eos> You and you in number one.<eos> Mr. Emmons, you're in number two with a decoy.
That's far enough.<eos> An honor to meet you.<eos> I understand you're here at great personal risk.<eos> Thank you for that.<eos> And you, you're here at great political risk, so thank you.
He was running toward a fallen comrade to save that man's life.<eos> That act, which was attested to by six soldiers who were actually there-- that act cost my son his life and won him the Silver Star.<eos> Whoever made the video is not only trying to undo that and damage him personally, but to damage my presidency.<eos> I call on the actual cowards, the people who made it, to come out of the shadows and show their faces.<eos> Madam President-Elect, are you calling this a conspiracy against you?
He says he's responding to your call to come out of hiding.<eos> He wants to discuss it with you on his show this afternoon.<eos> No debate, no prep, just two people talking.<eos> His words.<eos> Which, obviously, you don't want to do.
Elizabeth Keane.<eos> Welcome, Madam President-Elect.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So, let me ask you what everyone is asking right now-- why are you here?<eos> Because you invited me.
But what happens next?<eos> Six eyewitnesses testified Andrew was killed pulling a wounded soldier out of enemy fire.<eos> So, what happens next?<eos> Where is the original footage?<eos> You produced the video.
You must have it.<eos> You know why I produced the video?<eos> To destroy the memory of my son, to hurt me, and to damage my presidency.<eos> No, no, and no.<eos> I produced the video because some people-- people you call cowards, though every one of them's a veteran-- came to me with a story of injustice.
You know what would make them even angrier?<eos> If they learned how your operation was funded.<eos> - If they learned you were financed by the same establishment you claim to despise.<eos> That is an outrageous lie!<eos> You are not a free voice speaking truth to power.
- Now we are talking slander. - I have evidence of collusion with serving members of the intelligence community.<eos> It will go to the Attorney General.<eos> You will be prosecuted.<eos> You will be shut down.<eos> Because in my government, truth will have a value, and you will have no place.
Afraid.<eos> I felt the weight of the state, that jackboot on my neck when I heard these words from the president-elect--<eos> "You will be prosecuted.<eos> You will be shut down.<eos> Because in my government, you will have no place."
That's Quinn?<eos> That's his handle, supposedly.<eos> He started posting on conspiracy sites about four months ago.<eos> Is any of it real?<eos> Quinn was in lockup for a lot of this, so what do you think?
I was gonna... do this another time,<eos> - but it's been quite a night.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> And, uh, why not?<eos> Can you, uh, can you hold that for me?
The bullet.<eos> Another bullet.<eos> You know, honestly, when I got the call,<eos> I thought it was some kind of sick joke.<eos> You and your daughter seem to have the same sense of humor.
That could be the sitter.<eos> Other pocket.<eos> Other pocket.<eos> Charlie Harris' phone.<eos> You won a cruise.
And when you get back, we're gonna talk about that ring.<eos> Ruth?<eos> Grace is alive.<eos> But she is having trouble clotting.<eos> Does she have a liver disease that you're aware of?
They took care of her.<eos> And then I came back into her life, and I ruined everything.<eos> I'm sure that's not true.<eos> She found me a couple years ago.<eos> You know, one of those agencies, and, uh...
All right, Charlie.<eos> You have a bleed that is increasing the pressure, cutting off the circulation to your arm.<eos> So what I'm going to have to do...<eos> You're going to thread the balloon through the catheter into my arm.<eos> Once you find the bleed, you'll inflate the balloon, hope like hell the bleeding stops... any questions?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> My colleague, Dr. James...<eos> he'll do the procedure.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> You know him.
He was one of my favorites.<eos> You can still operate on him.<eos> No, no.<eos> No, I'm too close to this one.<eos> You operated on Charlie twice.
I'm the one who should apologize.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> No, there's no need.<eos> Really.<eos> I can't imagine what you've been through, Dr. Kinney.
Come on, Charlie.<eos> We have perfusion.<eos> It's gonna be okay.<eos> We may have saved the arm, but like I said, it's been bleeding for a while.<eos> So you're saying you may not be able to operate again.
- I'm up for all of it.<eos> So what?<eos> You expect me to just let you jump the queue?<eos> I think I've earned that right, yes.<eos> Dana, with all due respect, you wouldn't last a month as a resident.
I can't bear that.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> You think we're cursed?<eos> Alex, that's crazy.<eos> Charlie... you talk to ghosts.
That it does.<eos> I'd prefer you not to look at me, Lord.<eos> Is it wrong that I look?<eos> You have beauty.<eos> And you have an appetite I do not wish to satisfy.
You will enter the slave market alone.<eos> And then what happens, death?<eos> I will follow.<eos> I will be with the lepers.<eos> You will not be at our side?
There are further horsemen? He is correct, Lord.<eos> But these horsemen, they came from nowhere and asking us to where we were travelling and we prayed that they would leave us, vanish.<eos> You wanted rid of them?<eos> Believe me when I say this, they were not of this world, Lord.<eos> They were not men, like you and I are men.
He lives?<eos> Oh, he is well and he is near, very near.<eos> I must inform Abbot Eadred.<eos> Lord Abbot... he is here.<eos> They believe you to be the King, Lord.
And may I present to you Queen Hild of the water bucket, scourge of slavers and once thrown out of the nunnery!<eos> I was not!<eos> The Lord tells lies and all too easily.<eos> I will be the first to greet him formally.<eos> You will all wait upon my word.
I have the eyes of an old man.<eos> Lord King, I am the Abbot Eadred.<eos> And it is I to whom the blessed Saint Cuthbert...<eos> Abbot Eadred... I have been told of your dream.<eos> You... must be a most holy man.
No.<eos> I was just curious.<eos> - Guess.<eos> - What?<eos> Guess. What do you think he was doing up there?
- I am nice and calm. - Yeah. Hey.<eos> You're the calmest and the nicest person I know.<eos> Hard part's over.<eos> Just gonna crack this open, okay?<eos> And you are free. Congratulations.
They don't stay in one place for too long.<eos> That was smart of them.<eos> I know what you're thinking.<eos> They made me go to a hotel in Phoenix.<eos> I felt the same way you do right now when I heard it the first time.
Good evening.<eos> G'day, sweetheart.<eos> Ladies.<eos> May I ask why you're blocking my driveway?<eos> Are you chief of police? Indeed I am.
"And He looked at them and raised His hand, but they did not wave in response.<eos> And so He clutched the stone to His chest and jumped into the water."<eos> I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.<eos> I know who you are.<eos> Well, I don't know who you are.
I am trying to fucking save these people.<eos> Save them from what?<eos> ... Christopher Sunday.<eos> I'm sorry if I mispronounced.<eos> Are you Christopher Sunday?
Otherwise, they're not gonna believe me.<eos> Sit!<eos> Sit.<eos> Friend, I am acting in your best interest.<eos> You are looking at an initiated Yanmedjaran.
Taxi!<eos> Do you know when the bus is supposed to get here?<eos> Any minute now.<eos> Excuse me, miss?<eos> Are you a mother?
What kind of medical examination?<eos> It's very routine.<eos> It's noninvasive.<eos> And once you're done, Dr. Bekker and I, we will just ask you a few questions and then we can move on to the next step.<eos> If you're a doctor, why aren't you doing the exam?
Through the machine?<eos> - Is it here in this building?<eos> No, it's not here.<eos> I'm happy to answer any other questions you may have about the device, technical or otherwise.<eos> Why haven't you used it?
Dr. Van Eeghen, the man who... The man who designed the device, he was one of the first people to use it.<eos> Yes.<eos> And if you see him, tell him we said hello and that Finland won the World Cup.<eos> What did she say?<eos> Dr. Bekker is... Dr. Bekker thinks you have no intention of using the device.
Likes the top deck.<eos> But I'd steer clear if I were you.<eos> Excuse me, sir.<eos> Sir.<eos> I'm sorry to bother you, but are you telling people you're God?
Fishing boat found a body.<eos> Matches your description.<eos> I've notified the police.<eos> They'll be taking Burton into custody when we dock.<eos> They'd like you to go down to the station and make a statement, assuming you don't have any pressing business in Melbourne.
But Kevin, he'll come back.<eos> He always does.<eos> G'day. Miss Playford?<eos> No, sir.<eos> And who might you be?
President.<eos> - The president?<eos> - Of the United States.<eos> And based on our intel, in, well, just under two hours he's gonna start an unsanctioned nuclear war.<eos> And you are the only man alive who can get to him before he does.
Hello.<eos> Hello.<eos> Are you Christopher Sunday?<eos> Yes.<eos> My name is Kevin, and I know this is gonna sound crazy... but you're not the Prime Minister of Australia.
You have been living in our home for some time now.<eos> I don't imagine there's much about my husband and I that you don't know.<eos> With the debt he owes, he is going to be fighting this fight for the rest of his life.<eos> And for as long as he is chained to this place, then I am as well.<eos> I wonder, ma'am, if he might want you to leave.
That is why they are still in chains, out of fear that they might rise up and join Julius's army before ever submitting to yours.<eos> We tried to prevent the reprisals the moment we learned of them, Captain Flint and I.<eos> - They must know that.<eos> - They know.<eos> But they also know that when it comes to these men, neither you nor Captain Flint are fully in control of them.
911. What is your emergency?<eos> Last time we spoke, you said you were moving in on Jadalla Bin-Khalid.<eos> Now you're telling me he escaped?<eos> Jadalla may have gotten a heads up that we were tracking him because of the leaked story.<eos> So you dropped the ball?
That's why we're here.<eos> The truth about what?<eos> About an hour ago, Jadalla Bin-Khalid launched a massive terrorist attack on New York City.<eos> And we know he's planning more.<eos> We also know that you've been in contact with him.
Keep... keep pressure on it, Isaac.<eos> Keep pressure on it, all right?<eos> I'm going back inside.<eos> Stay there.<eos> You brought this on yourself, Mr. Donovan, but you can put an end to it at any moment.
I won't help you recover your files.<eos> Andy Shalowitz on a suicide mission.<eos> That's hard to believe.<eos> Yeah, maybe he decided he had nothing left after you took a job he loved and lived for.<eos> How did you and Jadalla Bin-Khalid communicate?
When do I go into surgery?<eos> She first thing she said when I got to her was your name.<eos> More pressure please.<eos> Blood pressure's 90/60.<eos> You're the only thing she was thinking about.
Perhaps if I just pop in for a quick hello--<eos> - Now is not a good time.<eos> - They're in one of their moods.<eos> They seemed so sweet.<eos> Do you have children, Justice Strauss?
I spoke with Governor Raja... just before he set sail.<eos> I wanted to be certain that our account with him was squared, that we ought to expect no return by his fleet, considering there were promises made to him that remain unfulfilled... To deliver the still missing cache and Jack Rackham.<eos> Governor Raja assured me he had already written off the missing cache, the war effort being of paramount importance.<eos> But Captain Rackham... he said he had never asked for Captain Rackham.<eos> You added that part.
Excuse me?<eos> The news you bring about Eleanor.<eos> It's that she's dead, isn't it?<eos> It is.<eos> And who are you?
About what?<eos> He said he wants to make a deal.<eos> Follow me, please, Captain.<eos> Those men at that table are among the wealthiest in the Pennsylvania Colony and critical suppliers to my husband's business.<eos> They consider character to be of paramount importance in choosing their partners, and so my husband has gone to great lengths to assure them that our family's sordid beginnings are long since behind us, and you just stood in front of them
That is correct.<eos> In the Bahamas.<eos> And you pay wages for all of that?<eos> That doesn't seem very wise to me.<eos> You are not from Nassau.
The threat will not...<eos> The defense of civilization is not your responsibility, sir!<eos> Your duty is to restore stable profits to Nassau.<eos> And the men charged to follow you to that end are already questioning their trust in you.<eos> If they see pirates return here, if they see skirmishes begin again on this island and they know that it was because you invited it... then you are going to have a mutiny on your hands, sir.
Wherever he's going, we follow him.<eos> This should be good.<eos> What is it I can do for our lord governor?<eos> I don't come on behalf of the governor, ma'am.<eos> You are Governor Rogers' woman, are you not?
This should be good.<eos> What is it I can do for our lord governor?<eos> I don't come on behalf of the governor, ma'am.<eos> You are Governor Rogers' woman, are you not?<eos> I am, which is why I believe you and I may be able to help each other.
I may be able to help you get back inside.<eos> Back on the council?<eos> Go on.<eos> I found a journal Eleanor kept.<eos> In it, she mentioned that when Nassau last threatened to descend into chaos... you were the one to whom she turned to help prevent it.
The music of Mozart was not heard by the people of his time the way we hear it today.<eos> Why?<eos> Because our senses, including our common sense, are evolving.<eos> And I think that is because of people like you.<eos> If BPO thinks the way you do, why all the secrecy and control?
Because our senses, including our common sense, are evolving.<eos> And I think that is because of people like you.<eos> If BPO thinks the way you do, why all the secrecy and control?<eos> Obviously, not everyone thinks like I do.<eos> What do they want that's different from what you want?

From Seoul Metropolitan Police.<eos> I was hoping to talk to you about Sun Bak.<eos> Hope is undiscovered disappointment.<eos> I hope to keep her alive.<eos> Do you?
Why?<eos> Fuchs doesn't see what you are.<eos> He doesn't know.<eos> But I do.<eos> You are just like me.
Aye, that's the rub, laddie.<eos> Mr. Hoy is back.<eos> What a charming little empty box you've chosen here.<eos> All the modern amenities of a prison cell.<eos> Where are you visiting from?
I call it my speakeasy 'cause you can speak easy in here.<eos> Soundproofing. Eighteen inches thick.<eos> All the modern amenities of a coffin.<eos> Aye.<eos> So, Miss Blue, if you and your laddie are not a pair of headhunters, putting on your show was a terrible risk.
All the modern amenities of a coffin.<eos> Aye.<eos> So, Miss Blue, if you and your laddie are not a pair of headhunters, putting on your show was a terrible risk.<eos> Care to explain what possessed you?<eos> Well, Mr. Hoy, if you're not a BPO headhunter, then leaving your coffin to come to my show was a terrible risk.
From Seoul Metropolitan Police.<eos> I was hoping to talk to you about Sun Bak.<eos> Hope is undiscovered disappointment.<eos> I hope to keep her alive.<eos> Do you?
- Yes. Do you know why?<eos> No.<eos> Because I see the misery of Polish women every day.<eos> Why am I wasting my breath?<eos> You know what I do.
Well, yes... we know a little bit.<eos> You lived in a triangle.<eos> - What does it matter?<eos> - What about the author's ethics?<eos> Are you a priest?
You have no idea how many surgeries I've performed after illegal abortions!<eos> - It's a skeleton in the closet!<eos> - Okay, we'll inform the publishing house management about our decision.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> Where are you from?
- What do you mean?<eos> - Where are you from?<eos> I don't get it?<eos> - I'm from Warsaw.<eos> - You're from a vagina.
- What?<eos> - Don't be shy.<eos> I'm a doctor.<eos> - Pull your pants down. - Relax.<eos> You're pretty handsome.
Stay put!<eos> There's a fire in the house!<eos> - You have no right!<eos> - What the fuck?<eos> ! Who are you?
I know it's crazy to ask you for support, but I want to help common people not to cheat on each other, to have some fun in life.<eos> We also care about the common man.<eos> Especially nowadays.<eos> Love your neighbor as yourself.<eos> Do you believe in God?
That's what we call 'going from pillar to post.'<eos> Yes.<eos> There is still a third pillar of authority in this country.<eos> - The Church is the first one.<eos> - You said that.
- Oh, no...<eos> I am a love connoisseur too.<eos> - Doctor Wislocka?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Who are you?
Doctor!<eos> No need to walk!<eos> I'll take you on my lap!<eos> Is that an offer?<eos> But you are too ugly!
Stay with me.<eos> You know where you can shove your review of my book for the Central Committee?<eos> In these clothes you look like Maryla Rodowicz.<eos> Not like a serious academic.<eos> You hate competing with a woman.
Then I become aware of a payment.<eos> A payment?<eos> That your wife received.<eos> From Axelrod.<eos> An account of hers that you're a signer on.
A payment?<eos> That your wife received.<eos> From Axelrod.<eos> An account of hers that you're a signer on.<eos> Right around, uh, well, hell, right on the day that you suspended your investigation into him.
She seems to also know about this, too.<eos> So I'm to report to her Thursday... where she will greet me warmly, shake me by the hand... and then she'll fire me.<eos> The tip that led to my investigation was called in from a cellphone that pinged a tower in Yonkers in the middle of the night.<eos> Why do I give a fuck?<eos> Because you were in Yonkers at the pizzeria meeting with Axelrod.
The tip that led to my investigation was called in from a cellphone that pinged a tower in Yonkers in the middle of the night.<eos> Why do I give a fuck?<eos> Because you were in Yonkers at the pizzeria meeting with Axelrod.<eos> And I think whatever you heard in that meeting made you squeamish.<eos> You know what Rhoades is, Bryan.
Because you were in Yonkers at the pizzeria meeting with Axelrod.<eos> And I think whatever you heard in that meeting made you squeamish.<eos> You know what Rhoades is, Bryan.<eos> You know he should be out of the job.<eos> And I know you made that call.
My father...<eos> - Come on, baby.<eos> It's okay.<eos> - My father...<eos> You killed my father.
You're the reason he died.<eos> Melissa...<eos> It's all right, Melissa.<eos> We understand.<eos> I hope you die and she becomes president.
I wanted to see you... to ask you a simple question.<eos> Didn't you know what was going on in your home?<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - You knew... even before he went to Pakistan.<eos> - I mean, you raised him.
- No.<eos> No. He had some problems.<eos> He got lost.<eos> - But no, nothing like this.<eos> - But you saw what he did, didn't you?
I'll tell you what, Detective. You have questions for Mr. Josepovich?<eos> Write them down, I'll make sure he gets them.<eos> Anything other than that, come back with a warrant.<eos> You gotta be fucking kidding.<eos> You meditate?
You meditate?<eos> No.<eos> That's a shame.<eos> Otto: Your friend is charged with driving his car over his cousin.<eos> Hope you don't mind me asking, but just out of curiosity, how'd you two meet, you and Mr. Collins?
That still puts you ahead of the rest of us.<eos> I want you to act as my ADC and local liaison with our colleagues in London.<eos> Division has also asked that news of Dr Neilsen's death is for the moment withheld from the press for reasons of political sensitivity.<eos> How many papers went astray?<eos> You said "a number".
It was cubicle two.<eos> DENIAL<eos> Professor Gradenko, may I introduce my driver,<eos> - Woman Police Constable Trewlove?<eos> - How do you do?
Oxford winning?<eos> Splendid, hm?<eos> Actually, it's pretty evenly poised,<eos> - sir.<eos> - Is it? - You play a little, Officer?
Sometimes, even by accident.<eos> You have to catch the person who killed Richard Nielsen.<eos> His last letter he sent, he said there were problems within his group.<eos> What kind of problems?<eos> He didn't say, but you should know our opinions were simpatico upon certain important matters.
Foul play, right?<eos> Look, you can tell me.<eos> I won't breathe a word.<eos> Guides' honour.<eos> Well, what do you know?
For how long?<eos> A couple of weeks, maybe a month.<eos> Such gallantry.<eos> And when did you really last see her?<eos> Shortly after you left, she dropped by... briefly.
Been there recently?<eos> Binsey?<eos> Good God, no.<eos> Wouldn't know where to find it.<eos> Easy enough to find an address, as you've already demonstrated.
Why the interest in Leighton-Asbury?<eos> The body of a young woman was found drowned at the house in Binsey this morning.<eos> Tessa Knight.<eos> That's awful.<eos> But... if you think Dr Leighton-Asbury's got anything to do with it, you're way off-beam.
- Well, I'm a scientist.<eos> I don't go in for God.<eos> But that man was a miracle worker.<eos> Where were you last night? For the record.<eos> You know where I was, I told you.
You were selected from a pool of tens of thousands of people.<eos> I don't recall applying for anything.<eos> You didn't.<eos> Our clients have an algorithm that pre-selects their clientele for them.<eos> And you happen to be the perfect man for the job.
I'm not coming out until it's safe.<eos> Try to stay calm, Mr. Lawes.<eos> The bad guys missed you.<eos> We're here to help. Our bosses are very interested in a bunch of VIPs that went missing last night.<eos> You were one of them.
Ran.<eos> Oh, you got a problem with how I do shit, pretty boy?<eos> Taystee?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm telling the real story, 'cause you sure the hell didn't.
I was looking to acquire a company.<eos> - Oh, sure. Hello, Mr. schaefer.<eos> How are you?<eos> -I've been better.<eos> -Well, you're alive.
- Okay, okay.<eos> -Have a good day, sweetie.<eos> -I'll try.<eos> My rates have gone up a little bit since the last time i worked for you.<eos> I get $2000 in a day now because I picked up an associate, and you'll have to cover my expenses.
-Did you ever suspect your wife might have a thing with Mr. singer?<eos> -We have a great life.<eos> I mean, this must've been just some random thing.<eos> I mean, we argue, you know, like any couple.<eos> But I'm just as shocked as you are.
Yeah, I'll send my associate, Tim, by later on tonight with an envelope.<eos> Yes, sir. No, thank you.<eos> Bye.<eos> All right.<eos> - Maybe you can help us just track this all the way through from the beginning.
Unfortunately, we are required to ask you questions, that although may seem stupid or annoying, they do help us in our investigation.<eos> - So is this the first time you cheated on your husband?<eos> -I think I want my lawyer.<eos> -Okay.<eos> You do have a right to counsel. But, um, just to let you know, we're not trying to implicate you for anything.
We just want to get some foundational facts.<eos> - And you can leave whenever you want.<eos> We just... the deceased...<eos> Cory singer, he... he has a voice too, and we want to help his voice be heard.<eos> We want to help you find who did this to him.
- And you can leave whenever you want.<eos> We just... the deceased...<eos> Cory singer, he... he has a voice too, and we want to help his voice be heard.<eos> We want to help you find who did this to him.<eos> - We need to know what you know.
-No.<eos> - Does he know...<eos> - He has no idea.<eos> - He has no idea.<eos> Are you sure about that?
- So all the other people that live on the block, they're not getting questioned, but we are?<eos> -He's a great guy.<eos> I can't imagine anyone who'd want to hurt him.<eos> -This don't make sense.<eos> You're treating us like we did a crime, and we just walking down the street.
- Who's this?<eos> - My name is detective Timothy Jones.<eos> I'm contacting you about an incident that took place in your home today.<eos> -Listen, what is going on?<eos> - As I understand it, you're out of town at the moment.
- I'll be on the next flight out.<eos> -Great.<eos> - Listen, can I speak to my wife?<eos> - Unfortunately, we are in the middle of an open investigation right now, so you cannot speak with her.<eos> But as soon as you get here, sir, she'll be available to you.
Hey, what's up?<eos> - We got a problem.<eos> - Well, we have witnesses that say they saw two hispanic males leaving the neighborhood in a rush after the screams.<eos> You got any enemies?<eos> - Who are you?
- Yeah, sure. What can I do for you?<eos> - Well, after speaking with your assistant, we were just wondering as to why you would cancel your anniversary trip to Hawaii this weekend?<eos> - Well, honestly, in light of the situation, why would I go to Hawaii?<eos> - Yeah, that's what we don't understand.<eos> You see, you canceled your tickets before your business trip.
Don't fucking tell me what I wanna do, man.<eos> -Are you going to kill me, huh?<eos> You think that's going to help you?<eos> - It might.<eos> You are at a major crossroad here, Jeff.
- One hour ago.<eos> We were expecting you yesterday.<eos> Your first mission in Afghanistan?<eos> Yes, Captain.<eos> What experience do you have?
Here.<eos> Let's lower him.<eos> One, two...<eos> Needle.<eos> Herat, do you copy?
Listen, I need you to do something for me.<eos> Anything you want.<eos> You have to pluck your bird's feathers.<eos> It has to weigh 1,500 kilos less.<eos> You convinced them we can do it without tools, what a bastard.
You think we're fucking camping here?<eos> That's enough, Lieutenant.<eos> - It's her first mission here.<eos> - I don't care, Captain.<eos> You need to know you've come to a war.
Ogre 2, take over.<eos> This is Ogre 2.<eos> I'm out too.<eos> Alpha 1, we've opened a window.<eos> Two, you see the point?
- I owe a lot to Mrs. Mukherjee.<eos> I came to see you only because she insisted.<eos> Actually, I never want to get married.<eos> Please deny this proposal for me.<eos> You may give any reason.
- Yes, I am.<eos> Rohan, are you mad?<eos> What will the people think?<eos> If we think what people think, what will the people think, Su?<eos> Rohan, you are..
- Please come.<eos> Such passion!<eos> Is she your friend or girlfriend?<eos> Please call out for her on the mic..<eos> You do it.
I love them!<eos> Really?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Come here.<eos> You'll love this.
Su.<eos> - What?<eos> It feels, that two negatives are going to become positive.<eos> Is it?<eos> You're using my line on me!
Listen..<eos> What?<eos> - I have a special gift for you.<eos> What is it?<eos> You will need these..
- What?<eos> I mean, without seeing, how can they..<eos> They touch and feel!<eos> Candles!<eos> You remembered!
Are you testing me?<eos> - Is there a problem?<eos> I owed you Rs. 80, right?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> You gave me Rs. 10.
Go on.<eos> Listen to me..<eos> I had something important to ask.<eos> Despite trying so hard, we cannot even lure a maid.<eos> But you, being blind, hit just the right one..
Your report is ready.<eos> The doctor will see you now.<eos> Mr. Bhatnagar, do not expect much from this report.<eos> The 24 hours following the molestation are the most critical for evidence.<eos> You have showed up after 30 hours, that too, drenched.
Talk to me first.<eos> Look at this!<eos> 'No clinical evidence of rape.' It says here, clearly!<eos> You guys are frauds.<eos> You filed a complaint of molestation and then, disappeared for 24 hours.
Rohan, the food is here.<eos> Let's eat.<eos> I'm not hungry, Su.<eos> You..<eos> You carry on.
Let's go.<eos> Your wife looked beautiful.<eos> I am Corporate Madhavrao Shellar<eos> Amit's older brother.<eos> I don't know why I feel that you will not vote for me in these elections.
The police is in my pocket, so they bailed Amit out.<eos> Mr. Bhatnagar, I am terribly sorry.<eos> You were newlyweds.<eos> Just married, and she passed away so soon.<eos> But you did get to enjoy with her, first.
The more you talk, the more humiliated<eos> Amit will get.<eos> I need to send him to Delhi.<eos> The people in the neighbourhood will forget all this, soon.<eos> You should too.
Do you think he's free for you?<eos> Do you know how many precincts he looks after?<eos> He has to handle so many cases.<eos> You don't even have a case.<eos> You're a fraud.
- Answer!<eos> I will answer them.<eos> You will neither need an FIR nor a medical check-up.<eos> You might need a post-mortem, perhaps.<eos> And you think, you'll escape it?
Just the way they did.<eos> - Perfect crime!<eos> And do you think we'll not look into it?<eos> No, sir.<eos> You will watch everything happen yet, you'll not be able to see, how it happened.
- Perfect crime!<eos> And do you think we'll not look into it?<eos> No, sir.<eos> You will watch everything happen yet, you'll not be able to see, how it happened.<eos> You will hear everything, but won't figure anything out.
And do you think we'll not look into it?<eos> No, sir.<eos> You will watch everything happen yet, you'll not be able to see, how it happened.<eos> You will hear everything, but won't figure anything out.<eos> Your jaw will drop, and you will not be able to say a word.
No, sir.<eos> You will watch everything happen yet, you'll not be able to see, how it happened.<eos> You will hear everything, but won't figure anything out.<eos> Your jaw will drop, and you will not be able to say a word.<eos> And the biggest thing, sir is that you will understand everything
Really?<eos> So, let's go, then.<eos> Let's go, Mr. Wasim.<eos> Easy.<eos> You're too drunk!
He's with Amit all the time.<eos> Tell me, sir.<eos> What do I have to do?<eos> Well..<eos> You arrest people for a couple of days..
Tell me.<eos> Should I book a room?<eos> Come on!<eos> We'll have fun.<eos> You're a dead man.
Don't scream.<eos> Now, go.<eos> Go right now behind the mosque, and see it yourself.<eos> Then you'll believe me.<eos> You'll know who called whom.
"I've gotten used to you."<eos> "Since a few days"<eos> "I've gotten used to you."<eos> "Since a few days"<eos> "you've become my habit."
"It's all yours."<eos> "Since a few days"<eos> "I've gotten used to you."<eos> "Since a few days"<eos> "you've become my habit."
Hello.<eos> - Wasim, Amit speaking.<eos> You're calling from Mumbai, right?<eos> The number is local.<eos> Your brother was saying that you're in Pune.
I thought, I'll pacify you with the best whiskey.<eos> Right?<eos> - You stabbed my father.<eos> You misbehaved with Lubna.<eos> You think
You think<eos> I'll sit with you and drink here!<eos> Hey!<eos> I don't care about any of that!<eos> You never behaved yourself either, with that blind woman.
Do you have proof that Amit was in Pune last night?<eos> Are you questioning me or suspecting me?<eos> Both.<eos> Look, Chaubey<eos> I've been in power for as long as you've been an officer.
Raise your hands.<eos> Who is it?<eos> Are you crying?<eos> One day, you'll have to cry too, sir.<eos> The day you chop onions at home.
Did you forget?<eos> Sir, I said that in anger.<eos> Moreover, why would I kill Wasim, sir?<eos> Because he raped your wife.<eos> But you said there was no proof of it, sir.
Are you all crazy!<eos> I didn't kill Wasim.<eos> I know that..<eos> And I know who killed him.<eos> You're next.
All right, let's play.<eos> Here.<eos> Pick it up.<eos> Get up.<eos> You'll attack once, and then, I'll attack.
Hit me!<eos> My turn.<eos> Give it to me.<eos> Give it to me.<eos> I must say, although you're blind, you're quite gutsy!
Take this.<eos> I'm giving you one last chance.<eos> Pick it up.<eos> Come on.<eos> If you hadn't removed your shoes you may have gotten away.
Pick it up.<eos> Come on.<eos> If you hadn't removed your shoes you may have gotten away.<eos> Even a dead man could sniff your socks.<eos> Now you tell me.
It's nothing.<eos> Listen, you missed school again?<eos> There's a football match between our colony and Navjeevan Society.<eos> I'm going to practise for it.<eos> You're too much.
And how did he agree?<eos> Whose voice did you imitate to call him?<eos> You're very talented, Rohan Bhatnagar.<eos> Remember, you told me that this game has no lifeline.<eos> But you gave me a lifeline today.
Sabalkar.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> I gave you four numbers.<eos> - Yes.<eos> You've sent me just one address.
- The guy who called your brother to the warehouse.<eos> Tell me your name if you have the guts.<eos> Rohan.<eos> Rohan Bhatnagar.<eos> You stay there..
I'll kill you in your house.<eos> It's futile going there.<eos> The police are fielding it.<eos> Where are you? Tell me!<eos> You'll come, won't you?
Come out.<eos> Sir.<eos> Anna, get him.<eos> Anna!<eos> You're next.
Let it go.<eos> Your plan has failed, Bhatnagar.<eos> One movement of my finger will bring your life to an end.<eos> But not so soon, Bhatnagar.<eos> You killed Amit in such a way that I couldn't even cremate him.
You killed Amit in such a way that I couldn't even cremate him.<eos> I'll kill you like that too.<eos> Get up!<eos> My Supriya didn't have an easy death.<eos> You won't have an easy death either.
Don't move from here.<eos> Do you remember the fourth option, sir?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> You'll know.<eos> But you will not be able to explain it to the others.
I got it, give here.<eos> I parked just out front, sweetheart.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Marteen McGuire, new patient, she came in last night?<eos> Are you family?
I parked just out front, sweetheart.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Marteen McGuire, new patient, she came in last night?<eos> Are you family?<eos> Sir, are you family?
Wait, it's like... a woman has two babies.<eos> They ain't twice as much work, she does the same thing for both, that's why she's got two tits, right?<eos> Can you believe this...?<eos> It's OK.<eos> Well now, Walt, wouldn't you have made a damned fine attorney?
They ain't twice as much work, she does the same thing for both, that's why she's got two tits, right?<eos> Can you believe this...?<eos> It's OK.<eos> Well now, Walt, wouldn't you have made a damned fine attorney?<eos> My point is.... maybe you could see your way clear to giving us a discount here.
But we always want to do the right for our kids, right or wrong.<eos> We'll do anything to help them out, spare them any pain.<eos> Trust me, you're doing the right thing.<eos> Walt, listen to me.<eos> You're paying me to keep your sons out of jail.
OK!<eos> Well, then I'll just save my opening statement for the trial.<eos> Call your first witness.<eos> The People call detective John Dromoor.<eos> And on the night of July 4th, detective, you responded to a call in Rocky Point Park.
Actually, detective, it's my partner and I...<eos> And actually, there's no question pending.<eos> I'd like to rephrase, your Honor.<eos> Thank you, Jesus.<eos> Detective, on the night of July 4th when you and your partner were driving through Rocky Point Park,
Thank you Mrs McGuire.<eos> [OUT OF MY WAY]<eos> - Mrs McGuire?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Prior to your attack, did you know the assailants?
Sleep when she sleeps.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Oh, God...<eos> How is she doing?<eos> How do you think?
How do you think?<eos> Get out.<eos> Get out!<eos> Mrs Kevecki...<eos> You... promised... to protect Teena.
Stay back!<eos> Police!<eos> John Dromoor, badge 736, requesting an ambulance and a coroner's wagon.<eos> Chippewa and 4th.<eos> And at the time of the shooting, you were entirely unaware that this was James de Lucca.
I'm presenting an option.<eos> Do you not hear yourself?<eos> We are the victims.<eos> That drunk bitch came on to us, selling her ass.<eos> You said, you said that... we were, we all agreed we were messed up and then the cops went looking for the wrong guys.
I was gonna say bye to Annie?<eos> I also wanted to make one last stop.<eos> You wanna come with me?<eos> You think I'm the bad guy?<eos> Because I defend men that you think are...
Maybe they had it coming.<eos> Maybe they didn't.<eos> Guess we'll never know now.<eos> Who knows?<eos> You might even need my services someday.
Maybe they didn't.<eos> Guess we'll never know now.<eos> Who knows?<eos> You might even need my services someday.<eos> And I hope, you'll never need mine.
Listen, lady.<eos> Please?<eos> I'm not leaving until you tell me why.<eos> Why'd you do it?<eos> It sounds to me like you're doing a lot of blaming.
Love is not an easy thing.<eos> This much I know.<eos> You are a river of fire.<eos> I do not know how to swim.<eos> You could write poetry or crime thrillers.
Good afternoon.<eos> Loving this... this whole look.<eos> Can you check online to see if any of this has gotten out?<eos> Please, sit.<eos> So, really, who are you?
I realize how this looks.<eos> But in my defense, most infractions are harmless.<eos> And it's not our policy to arrest guests at the museum.<eos> As owner of this exhibit, I find that answer unacceptable.<eos> You need to find these men, Ms. Walker, or I'll see to it that Anders Enterprises files charges against you and the museum.
Thank you.<eos> Please level with me.<eos> I'm in a lot of trouble.<eos> The time machine exhibit is my responsibility, and I don't wanna lose my job.<eos> Who are you?
Very well.<eos> My name is Sigmund...<eos> Don't say "Freud."<eos> Kemp.<eos> And you were correct.
And you were correct.<eos> I... I am an actor.<eos> And I am playing H.G. Wells in a small production about his life.<eos> I am sorry about what happened at the museum earlier.<eos> So, you're an actor, you're from London, and this is all just a big prank?
When one has to pay the rent.<eos> I majored in art history because I absolutely loved it, but I really didn't think it through in terms of careers.<eos> It's not forever.<eos> I hope you like Chinese.<eos> So, I take it that you're single.
Jane?<eos> Jane?<eos> No.<eos> Hello, Mr. Wells.<eos> Who are you?
She was just here.<eos> John took her.<eos> You mean the Ripper took her.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> Because you told me.
You spoke of the key and a woman in danger.<eos> None of this makes any sense.<eos> That's what I said.<eos> Then you handed me a letter.<eos> You said for me to find the time machine.
- Let's go.<eos> - Let's get out of here.<eos> You weren't supposed to be here.<eos> And now she's dead.<eos> You've killed her.
He still wants the key.<eos> How are you, Miss Walker?<eos> I've been better.<eos> You've been through quite an ordeal.<eos> You and that other woman are lucky to be alive.
No siblings, no extended family.<eos> There is no one else.<eos> Why are you telling me this?<eos> I took the shirt you were wearing when you first arrived and had a genealogy test done from the blood and DNA on it.<eos> The preliminary results are back, and I'm not really sure how, but you and I... We're family.
Hello again.<eos> Hello...<eos> It's Griffin.<eos> Yes, Griffin.<eos> And you're George...
Job, jobs, jobs, I'm just creating jobs.<eos> Don, do you like your job?<eos> Yes, I'm happy to be gainfully employed, sir.<eos> Do you like Frankenstein?<eos> Do you?
Over.<eos> Mama Roger. What about Mills?<eos> Over.<eos> Those are ice chips in that blue cup.<eos> You were at my sister's funeral.
And the box here.<eos> I'm assuming that this is Zack Addy's personal effects?<eos> Yes, I... thought you might want to see these.<eos> The photographs, some press clippings...<eos> As you can see, he was very fond of you, Dr. Brennan.
What about any evidence that could possibly exonerate or... convict Dr. Addy?<eos> No.<eos> I didn't find any such evidence.<eos> Nor was I looking for any.<eos> You always taught me to examine the evidence without any preconceived bias.
Agent Booth...<eos> Dr. Brennan, it's good to see you again.<eos> I'm glad to see you're unharmed.<eos> Your husband, when...<eos> when last we spoke, when he assaulted me, insisted that you were in harm's way.
when last we spoke, when he assaulted me, insisted that you were in harm's way.<eos> We just need to ask you a few questions, that's all, Dr. Faulk.<eos> Starting with your relationship with Dr. Zack Addy.<eos> You knew him, didn't you?<eos> Dr. Brennan, are you aware that the average murderer has an IQ of less than 90?
Sorry.<eos> Er, yes, we understand.<eos> Megan Colley.<eos> Junior geologist.<eos> You must be Daniel Langham, I presume? Yes.
Megan Colley.<eos> Junior geologist.<eos> You must be Daniel Langham, I presume? Yes.<eos> I'm a volcanologist here.<eos> And you're Stephen's brother? Yes.
As a matter of fact, there is.<eos> My officer here would like to ask you a few questions.<eos> Wouldn't you?<eos> Oh, yes, Commissioner.<eos> Now, we understand that you and Stephen Langham had been meeting up at the Yacht Club?
It's nothing.<eos> All I asked was to take it up to 500.<eos> It's not as if he had a family to support. What?<eos> We never actually checked Stephen's will.<eos> But I assume that if something happened to him, you'd inherit?
It belonged to you lot.<eos> And I believe you placed it up there with the seismometer.<eos> You then dialled it intermittently over a three-night period to upset the readings from the extremely sensitive instruments and lead Stephen to think it was cause for concern.<eos> The afternoon of his murder, you both headed up to supposedly check on the seismometer.<eos> Having removed the phone first, you convinced Stephen there was nothing wrong with the equipment.
That's why you'd come to see him that morning.<eos> We think a meeting was due to take place in which you expected<eos> Stephen to sign off on moving the exclusion zone, thus granting you planning consent.<eos> But how could you be so sure that he would sign after he'd been so adamant he wouldn't?<eos> Because you'd enrolled someone to help you.
I heard you're looking for a champion to join you.<eos> So I brought my resume.<eos> I like your style.<eos> Reminds me of myself at a younger age.<eos> Well, thanks. But, you know I'm not as handsome as you are, sir. Ha.
Ah!<eos> How about one of those chunky stone necklaces you like to wear?<eos> Booth, I'm serious.<eos> So am I.<eos> Well, if you don't want a thing, you know, how about, like, an experience?
Good work, Riley.<eos> There's someone who deserves the genius grant.<eos> Who would want to kill a guy like this?<eos> You know, you're awfully quiet.<eos> You're not upset about Angela winning that whole McDonald's award?
‚ô™ Hot blooded ‚ô™<eos> ‚ô™ Catch it and see ‚ô™<eos> ‚ô™ I got a fever of 103 ‚ô™<eos> ‚ô™ Come on, baby ‚ô™<eos> ‚ô™ Do you do more than dance?
You know what I think?<eos> I think you mixed it up with Ian and you ended up killing him, that's what I think.<eos> That's ridiculous.<eos> If one of my employees struck me on the skull, I'd have fired him on the spot.<eos> Please. Do you know how hard it would be to replace me?
Well, our team will have to verify that.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sure.<eos> Go right ahead.<eos> But if you want to find the actual killer, you ought to be questioning those nuts from Stop the Robopocalypse.
I'll have Hodgins swab, see if we can identify the murder weapon.<eos> Oh, and, Daisy... if... the NFL doesn't hire you... you'll always have a job here.<eos> Hey, uh, according to Alan's computer, he was telling the truth.<eos> He was logged in and working until 4:00 a.m. last Friday night.<eos> The guy's a coder-- you don't think he could have faked that?
Oh, I would say "shoot," but you did once put a bullet in my arm.<eos> I need you to level with me.<eos> Do you think I really have a chance of landing that lead anthropologist job?<eos> 'Cause the thought of not getting it makes me feel like such a failure.<eos> Daisy, look, I know that you and I have a history of... getting on each other's nerves, but I do think you're a highly skilled scientist.
Hold on.<eos> Just because I blogged about the military smart drone program doesn't make me guilty of treason.<eos> I had no idea those files were classified.<eos> We didn't bring you in here because of your blog, Matthew.<eos> You're under investigation for the murder of Ian Goldberg.
We didn't bring you in here because of your blog, Matthew.<eos> You're under investigation for the murder of Ian Goldberg.<eos> Why would I want to kill him?<eos> You tell me.<eos> You're the one who attacked him with the baseball bat.
You're under investigation for the murder of Ian Goldberg.<eos> Why would I want to kill him?<eos> You tell me.<eos> You're the one who attacked him with the baseball bat.<eos> After that, you lost your job, your house, your wife filed for divorce.
I think you blamed Ian for that, so you decided to come back and finish him off.<eos> I never meant to hurt Ian.<eos> I tried to smash his robot, only he stepped in to protect the damn thing.<eos> Well, destruction of property is still a felony.<eos> You'd want to destroy robots, too, if you realized what the government was doing with them.
Hold... hold on a second here.<eos> I-Ian didn't even make weapons.<eos> I mean, the guy made robots that helped autistic kids.<eos> So he said.<eos> Guys like Ian always claim that they're trying to save the world, but the only thing they care about is selling out to the highest bidder. Do you know how many
Speaking of which, will there be dancing at this, uh, top secret shindig of yours?<eos> My lips are sealed.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> I'm your dad, Tempe.<eos> C-Can't you give me a hint?
Yes.<eos> Had I been grading you,<eos> I would have given you a solid "B."<eos> But I'm capable of A-plus work.<eos> You've seen it.
I didn't mean to do that, you know?<eos> I just got so mad about that stupid gift.<eos> What gift?<eos> That portable Bluetooth speaker, man.<eos> Let me get this straight: you killed Ian over a bad present?
You...<eos> That was pure creative genius.<eos> So when Ian said he made a deal and wanted to go to the woods to celebrate, I assumed I was getting a piece of that action.<eos> All he gave me was a lousy portable Bluetooth speaker, so I hit him in the head with it.<eos> You must have been tripping pretty hard to try to cut off his head with a pocketknife and then hide his body up a tree.
I'm the one who recommended her.<eos> And I also nominated Angela for the MacArthur grant.<eos> You did?<eos> Yes.<eos> But you made such a big deal about me not being a genius.
I'm really gonna miss you, Dr. Brennan.<eos> Oh...<eos> I'm gonna miss all of you.<eos> Champagne...<eos> You are a highly-skilled scientist, Daisy.
Dudes... this is totally boss!<eos> Baking soda and acid.<eos> Instant volcano!<eos> What?<eos> What are you two nerds laughing at?
It smells like death warmed over... almost like a toxic blast of camel butt.<eos> Wow.<eos> This is a black Kale chia smoothie.<eos> Why?<eos> Why are you drinking that?
- Hey, Bones, can you just tell me when the body was dumped in the acid there.<eos> I can't saywith any accuracy, but Hodgins would have a better idea.<eos> Oh, unfortunately, he wasn't able to make it.<eos> He had some kind of wheelchair accident.<eos> - So, do you have direct access to this site?
I can't saywith any accuracy, but Hodgins would have a better idea.<eos> Oh, unfortunately, he wasn't able to make it.<eos> He had some kind of wheelchair accident.<eos> - So, do you have direct access to this site?<eos> - I must warn you, if you even insinuate my involvement in this man's death,
Calm down? !<eos> Are you insane?<eos> !<eos> - Whoa.<eos> - Don't you know anything?
Well, it's possible.<eos> The killer could also be a fellow retiree.<eos> Come on. Seriously?<eos> You think that another senior killed and dumped our victim in acid?<eos> You're presuming that just because somebody is old, they are less capable?
And in his case, relatively imminent.<eos> Stop.<eos> Sorry, she didn't mean that.<eos> She just likes to blurt things out.<eos> You're gonna have a very healthy and happy life in front of you.
Can we continue this somewhere else?<eos> An excellent idea.<eos> I could show you to Mr. Felbeck's room.<eos> That would be best.<eos> You don't just scream out like that.
John George haigh?<eos> - You mean the acid bath murderer?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> One and the same.<eos> So, George found that it took 48 hours to fully dissolve a body to the point where you could actually pour it down the drain
Uh, Barbara Baker,<eos> - can we speak to you for one moment?<eos> - Oh, not now.<eos> I'm 84 and I'm playing Bridge.<eos> Whatever you need cannot be more important than playing Bridge.
Actually, it means his Bones were as strong<eos> - as a 30-year-old's.<eos> - And given the severity of the damage we're seeing, I don't think there's any chance one of the fellow residents could have done this to him.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Excuse me, are you Red Hudmore?
A gentleman...<eos> Would never talk that way about Donna Reed.<eos> Wait a second...<eos> You were with the 720 MP Battalion?<eos> Don't tell me you heard of us.
Right, well, Booth, now that we've verified the alibi, we should get going.<eos> It was an honor to meet you, sir.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey, Bones, hold...<eos> One more thing, you know, you know, I may need another set of eyes and ears on the property while I'm gone, in case you see anything.
Nothing's disturbed, there's no broken glass anywhere.<eos> You might want to check the couches over there.<eos> My guess is that's where they did the Dog Therapy.<eos> I don't need your assistance, Booth.<eos> If you are bored and need to keep busy,
Yeah.<eos> Now, grab a Cane and give him a good whack.<eos> What?<eos> No, I'm not hitting gramps.<eos> Oh, you'd do it if you ever met him, trust me.
What?<eos> No, I'm not hitting gramps.<eos> Oh, you'd do it if you ever met him, trust me.<eos> He was the most selfish, miserly billionaire son of a bitch this side of Montgomery Burns.<eos> Honey, maybe you should do it yourself.
The problem is the ribs are barely fractured.<eos> Which means the killer is someone significantly stronger than Hodgins.<eos> Or our victim's Bones weren't as robust as they were six months ago.<eos> I see you're, uh...<eos> You're taking some of our computers out for evidence.
- You get that.<eos> - All right, all right...<eos> Aah!<eos> Red!<eos> Red, Red, you okay?
The real question is, why wasn't he taking it?<eos> Angela, is this one of the computers<eos> - from the retirement home?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And you won't believe what I'm finding.
That's excellent detective work.<eos> I-I'm sorry, you-you're glad we found you out?<eos> Well, my taxes pay for your salary.<eos> I'm glad to see that they're not being wasted.<eos> Okay. So you want to know what I think happened?
No family except for an estranged daughter.<eos> You hit on her first.<eos> You played the lech, and then James swoops in like a knight in Shining Armor.<eos> You two were thick as thieves.<eos> You really expect us to believe that you didn't know what he was gonna
All right?<eos> The fracture came when Felbeck hit you with his Cane.<eos> You want to tell me what happened?<eos> It was when he started talking about the war.<eos> You caught him in one of his lies.
You know that I love you and I want to give you everything you've ever dreamed of.<eos> But getting pregnant right...<eos> I want to adopt.<eos> Adopt?<eos> No, you told me that...
To what job are you referring?<eos> Uh, ma'am, I hate to tell you, but, uh, our records show that Dustin was fired from that job six months ago.<eos> No, you're wrong.<eos> He... he told me all about that job, - how well he was doing.<eos> - Ms. Doyle, you have Parkinson's, don't you?
The victim's cell phone melted to his leg during the fire.<eos> All right, so do you think there's enough left to pull the data?<eos> Wow, this thing is really cooked, but I'll give it a shot.<eos> Okay.<eos> So, Ms. Martin, now, uh, you are the manager of Snoozeland, is that correct?
Actually... that is what I was hoping to speak with you about.<eos> How do you know?<eos> How do I know what, dear?<eos> When you've lost your passion for your work.<eos> You said that you woke up one morning and realized that it was gone.
Thanks, Booth.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey.<eos> Just wanted to see if everything was okay.<eos> It's not like you to miss anything on the bones.
I want to take my buddy here to a celebratory lunch.<eos> Upon recovering the body of Gormogon's original apprentice, we found blood on his clothing that was an exact match to the victim.<eos> It suggests he committed the murder before he himself died.<eos> But didn't the defendant-- that is to say, didn't I confess?<eos> It was a false confession, one you have since rescinded.
It was a false confession, one you have since rescinded.<eos> Thank you, Dr. Hodgins.<eos> Dr. Hodgins, in your considerable experience, isn't it rare to find such unbelievably strong evidence nearly a decade after a crime?<eos> It is.<eos> And didn't your colleagues wonder whether you might have planted this oh-so-convincing evidence?
Don't laugh this off, Agent Booth.<eos> Your wife is in serious danger.<eos> Okay, right, okay.<eos> Thanks for the update.<eos> You don't believe me but you will.
So everything we're hearing about Frankenfoods...?<eos> They're still foods and how they're processed and regulated, that's crucial, obviously.<eos> But that's a question for Government or business, not science.<eos> Listen, the more we learn about DNA, the more avenues there are for gene therapy, which could lead to the eradication of genetically-based illness and that has to be a tremendous positive.<eos> But you can reassure us, professor, no ten-foot mice on the cards, or triangular cows?
I think I know more about it than they do.<eos> Right.<eos> Yeah, well, you know, that's a relief cos I'd be worried to think that MPs set themselves up as experts on anything.<eos> Are you allowed to say that in here?<eos> Oh, off the record you are, yeah.
No... No.<eos> It's very easy for us to check all this out, you know.<eos> Who was in the car with you, where you were... that's even before we've had a proper chat with Costley.<eos> God knows what he'll have to say for himself, eh?<eos> So, are you telling me that's not you... in your car?
He agreed to help me out.<eos> To warn George Selway off.<eos> Why would you want him to do that?<eos> George Selway attacked me.<eos> So, you and Mark Costley were an item.
That's not what he told us.<eos> Just stick to the story.<eos> Trust me.<eos> We weren't sleeping together.<eos> And if he'd told you we were, I think you'd be confronting me with details.
Would you like some water?<eos> They keep talking about murder, but I... I wasn't even in the house.<eos> Surely forensics will tell them that.<eos> It doesn't matter, Yvonne.<eos> The prosecution will argue that you and Costley cooked up the idea to kill Selway together.
They keep talking about murder, but I... I wasn't even in the house.<eos> Surely forensics will tell them that.<eos> It doesn't matter, Yvonne.<eos> The prosecution will argue that you and Costley cooked up the idea to kill Selway together.<eos> That you drove the car.
Mark might have knocked him about a bit.<eos> Well, we'll establish all that when your case comes to court.<eos> For the moment, let's focus on bail, yeah?<eos> I'm just about persuaded to give bail in the particular circumstances of this case, despite the seriousness of the charge, due to the defendant's previous excellent character and everything else that's been said.<eos> You're to reside at your normal address and you must surrender your passport and pay into court a security in the sum of ¬£100,000.
No.<eos> If they accept Costley's plea, and that's by no means guaranteed, they still can come after you for murder because your defences are entirely separate.<eos> But it's not all doom and gloom...<eos> At the very least, if they accept diminished responsibility, it makes our lives easier.<eos> You're saying you had no idea Costley was going to kill George Selway and Costley is admitting that he acted on a reckless impulse of his own.
70% is how you look.<eos> None of this is me, you understand.<eos> The women, particularly, can be very hard on other women.<eos> I don't know if the prosecuting counsel will be a man or a woman.<eos> But if it is a woman, the jury will be more likely to think you're guilty during cross-examination about the rape.
And it must have gone wrong in some terrible, terrible, way.<eos> Quite a favour.<eos> You hadn't known each other that long, had you?<eos> A few months.<eos> The prosecution could try to claim you were lying about the whole thing, that you and Selway had consensual sex and you were spinning Costley a yarn to get him into trouble.
I haven't done anything!<eos> I haven't done anything!<eos> I'll be right behind you in the car, love.<eos> Suse, could you give me a hand, please?<eos> Mark Costley sent you a text from prison and you replied, is that right?
I got a text from a number that I didn't recognise.<eos> And I just asked who it was.<eos> And you sent a second text.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> The point is, he made contact and you responded.
You deserve everything you get!<eos> You bitch, you evil bitch!<eos> - Look at what you're doing to all of us...<eos> - Calm down.<eos> I have two children at home who have broken their hearts because their father is there, that you have brought into your mess...
Can you point her out to the court, please?<eos> I'm afraid Miss Bonnard, Mr Costley's barrister, might pile on the agony a bit as well.<eos> Brand-new silk.<eos> They always want to cross-examine every single witness.<eos> Isn't that what you'll be doing?
An innocent woman doesn't need to get bogged down in the sordid details.<eos> That's our message.<eos> Can you clarify, Dr Weatherfield, what kind of force would have been needed to cause this level of injury to the victim's neck area?<eos> It would have to be a blunt trauma injury of some force, consistent with stamping while the victim was face up on the floor.<eos> And how can you tell that this force would have been considerable?

Well, yes, of course.<eos> Then candidates who make the first cut move to a more extended period of training.<eos> Witness A, do you know the defendant, Mark Costley?<eos> Yes, I met Mr Costley in the autumn of 2008, when he applied to join the security services.<eos> He made the "first cut", as you would say?
During the time you were assessing Mr Costley, did you ever feel sufficient concern about his mental stability to raise the issue with his line manager in the Metropolitan Police Force?<eos> His mental stability?<eos> I'm sorry, I don't quite see where you're heading with this...<eos> I mean, it really wasn't my... role.<eos> I'm asking if you were happy enough with Mark Costley's mental state to allow him to continue working as a police officer, and then to move on into a sensitive position involving the security and the safety of our Members of Parliament,
- do you know him?<eos> - Yes, I worked with him throug hout my time at the Crown Estate.<eos> - On a daily basis?<eos> - That's correct.<eos> Would you mind describing to the court Mark Costley's responsibilities as a security advisor, so far as you understand them?
In November of the previous year, when Yvonne Carmichael told him she'd been raped, did you observe any change in your colleague Mark Costley's behaviour at that time?<eos> No.<eos> I don't remember any change whatsoever.<eos> He was just Mark.<eos> Sergeant Johns, you've told the court that you saw no change in Mark Costley's behaviour in November of last year.
Isn't it the case that, during November and into December of last year, the two of you had had a short-lived relationship, which ended acrimoniously?<eos> - No.<eos> That's absolutely untrue.<eos> - Which bit?<eos> That you and Mr Costley were in a relationship, or that it was over?
Once or twice?<eos> - Twice, maybe.<eos> - Oh, really?<eos> Well, my information is that it was at least three times.<eos> And on the last of these occasions, in early December of last year, you had intimate contact with Mr Costley in a Westminster pub called the Bull And Keg.
Immediately?<eos> Did you ask him to stop immediately, Sergeant Johns?<eos> Not immediately.<eos> No.<eos> So perhaps you could take us through exactly what happened between you in the Bull And Keg.
Mr Costley had his hand on my knee.<eos> It was making me uncomfortable.<eos> Just having his hand on your knee?<eos> No.<eos> I have no wish to embarrass you, Sergeant, but can I suggest that you and Mr Costley had been drinking together since around 6pm?
Did Mr Costley insert his fingers into your vagina, Sergeant Johns?<eos> Yes.<eos> And did you prevent him from doing so, or object in any way?<eos> Not at the time, no.<eos> So in other words, you and Mr Costley had intimate sexual contact, did you not?
Of course it's not!<eos> No further questions for this witness, my Lord.<eos> No questions, my Lord.<eos> Thank you, Sergeant Johns.<eos> You may step down.
Two weeks after I told you what George Selway did to me... you were in that pub with her.<eos> That's how much I mean to you.<eos> Dr. Sanderson, can you tell the jury what you do?<eos> I'm a consultant forensic psychiatrist and I've been practising as such for the last 23 years.<eos> You conducted an assessment of Mark Costley while he was on remand.
What was your intention when you went to see Mark Costley to ask his advice about George Selway?<eos> I just wanted it to stop.<eos> E-mailing me, texting, following me.<eos> When George turned up near my house, I... I was just so frightened.<eos> To be clear... did you wish George Selway physical harm?
To be clear... did you wish George Selway physical harm?<eos> No.<eos> Did you encourage or urge Mr Mark Costley to kill George Selway?<eos> No!<eos> While you were waiting, in the car, were you aware of what was taking place in George Selway's flat?
- That's correct.<eos> Now, you've said you were at the party with Mr Selway for some hours, drinking with him, before you went with him up to his secluded office on the fifth floor, an area of the building you knew would be empty at that time of night.<eos> Well, as I said, he mentioned something about getting some papers from his office.<eos> Yes.<eos> Just to establish, when you were drinking and smoking with Mr Selway, you were, for a time, seated together outside in a small courtyard in the middle of the building?
Yes.<eos> Just to establish, when you were drinking and smoking with Mr Selway, you were, for a time, seated together outside in a small courtyard in the middle of the building?<eos> Yes.<eos> I wasn't smoking.<eos> You were keeping him company, then.
Now, forgive me, you said it was eight years you worked for the Beaufort Institute.<eos> Erm... Full time, yes.<eos> And more recently part time.<eos> Of course.<eos> And during those eight years, you commuted every day?
- Pubs after work, so on.<eos> - My Lord, really!<eos> - Forgive me, my Lord, I am getting there.<eos> - Then do, please, Ms Bonnard.<eos> Dr Carmichael, in your professional capacity, you have been working in or visiting the Borough of Westminster for, what, around 12 years?
I have all of it.<eos> No, this isn't a high-level operation.<eos> It's the high-level operation.<eos> No, this isn't your team, it's mine.<eos> No, you are not in charge.
No, this isn't a high-level operation.<eos> It's the high-level operation.<eos> No, this isn't your team, it's mine.<eos> No, you are not in charge.<eos> You were in charge. I am in charge now.
If you have questions or concerns, I suggest you take those up with your boss, who can take them up with his boss, who can take them up with my boss.<eos> Guess who my boss is.<eos> I will give you a hint.<eos> His office is a big Oval.<eos> You want the hospital secured, ma'am?
Except he's not, not really.<eos> Not yet, anyway.<eos> He won the election.<eos> He won the general election, the popular vote.<eos> But you know as well as anyone, the President and Vice President of the United States aren't actually elected in the general election.
Or it could be Mellie or Jake or me or the Marine standing in the hall out there.<eos> The fact is, it could be almost anyone who meets the basic qualifications to be President, because, legally...<eos> And there are very few limits on what the Electoral College can do and very little precedent to indicate what it might do in a situation like this...<eos> Legally, the next presidency is wide open.<eos> But practically, I think it makes an enormous difference what you do.

I need to call my children.<eos> Their father's dead.<eos> I have to tell them their father's dead.<eos> I understand that, and I'm sorry for your loss, but that can't happen.<eos> Who the hell are you?
Telling me where you are.<eos> There's only one way to find out.<eos> _<eos> Theodore Bagwell.<eos> And you're Dr. Whitcombe, the man who invited me to this mystery meeting at 9:30 at night when the rest of the building's closed.
You feel an unease, do you?<eos> I'd venture that's what's always been in you since birth.<eos> Your soul.<eos> I just put the hardware into you.<eos> You're the thing that runs it.
From bar stools, to ping pong right before he took himself off the case.<eos> I'm giving you a chance to tell the truth.<eos> But I guess... old habits die hard.<eos> I am impressed by how well you played him.<eos> But then again, I remember how adept you and your friends are at that sort of thing.
And there's probably more to come.<eos> But the question is, why are you telling us this?<eos> I thought it was obvious.<eos> I am giving you a chance to tell your side of the story before my side becomes the only side.<eos> You were the one who rescued us five years ago.
That person had no idea what I'd done.<eos> The only thing that they were guilty of was helping someone in trouble.<eos> Do you know why your niece and her friends were at that farm tonight?<eos> They must have figured out it was me.<eos> You were getting ready to accuse them.
Once we saw your e-mail, we interrogated him.<eos> He's fully disclosed 21-Void's conspiracy to frame you for the murder of Harlan Gaines and bury your identity by giving you a new one:<eos> Kaniel Outis.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> It means... you're free to go, Mr. Scofield.
Give it time.<eos> Thank you for coming in, Mrs. Viola.<eos> And I wouldn't worry just yet, okay?<eos> We'll be keeping an eye on her behavior here at school.<eos> You keep an eye on her at home.
Talk about grand gestures.<eos> "Unreciprocated," she said.<eos> You didn't get that down.<eos> Only because I can't spell it.<eos> So, while this gun battle is going on, you're sitting outside in the car. Do I have that right?
What's going on with you?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Lobo tells me you're about a day away from getting the tube.<eos> You've been making progress, but you can't stay at Threshold if you drop any more weight.<eos> I just think it's so weird that you know everything about me... and I don't know anything about you.
They don't have much, but I can put something together.<eos> We can pay you.<eos> You work for money, don't you?<eos> Mister?<eos> It's true what you say, isn't it?
Na... vy... SEAL.<eos> No.<eos> Sir.<eos> Please.<eos> Whatever you want...
Uh, yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> So, you've spoken to SymcoPetro.<eos> They'll pay you. Did they tell you that?<eos> Whatever it is you want, they'll give it to you.
Okay, ladies.<eos> Thanks so much for your help.<eos> Oh, you're very welcome.<eos> Thank you both for being so patient.<eos> And, Mrs. Aherne, if you or Margaret ever need anything from me... anything at all... you can call me day or night.
- Yeah.<eos> - Make you?<eos> - Yeah, let's do this.<eos> You bring your commander down here, and I'll explain to him how you let us on the base, red-carpet treatment.<eos> No, b-because you lied your way in.
Were you being too aggressive?<eos> No, sir.<eos> No such thing.<eos> No such thing?<eos> This command relies on you exercising restraint when appropriate.
Furthermore, our investigation...<eos> The victim was an eyewitness in the Charles Mahoney murder trial.<eos> All the evidence points to Ms. Keating.<eos> Clearly, the Mahoney family had motive to kill Mr. Gibbins.<eos> Ms. Winterbottom, you asked for more evidence.
To accept the charges, press 3.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hey.<eos> It's me.<eos> Mr. Delfino, it is an ethical violation for you to be calling me.
This office does not tolerate threats.<eos> Find that body.<eos> Otherwise, it won't just be a threat.<eos> I will not stand by and let baseless accusations be leveled at any of my prosecutors.<eos> And I won't stand by while you frame my client for murder.
And I won't stand by while you frame my client for murder.<eos> You think Ingrid Peters is gonna take Keating's accusations seriously?<eos> She better.<eos> Otherwise, we'll take it to the FBI.<eos> There are bodies piling up around this woman, and you think she deserves justice?
Is that all?<eos> Okay.<eos> So, you admit that's your signature?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - But you didn't sign it?
He's Ms. Atwood's boyfriend. Doesn't that matter?<eos> Is this true, Ms. Atwood?<eos> You have a romantic relationship with Mr. Lahey?<eos> We were at some point, but it ended before this case.<eos> Were you aware of such a relationship, Mr. Denver?
! Unless you want to be held in contempt, Ms. Castillo, I'm advising you to calm down.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> No further questions.<eos> You're a law student, Ms. Castillo, so I assume that means you can define "perjury" for the court?
Or we found it in your car when we brought you into custody, proving that you killed Wes.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> Do the Mahoneys have something on you?<eos> Or are they paying you?<eos> Do you...
It is!<eos> It is personal!<eos> Call 911.<eos> Stash the guns.<eos> You should not be here when they arrive.
Well, pull up a chair.<eos> There's always room for one more.<eos> Now, Mr. McGill.<eos> - What?<eos> - You are unbelievable.
- What?<eos> - You are unbelievable.<eos> I could not for the life of me figure out why Mrs. Landry... would suddenly change her mind about the Sandpiper settlement.<eos> I had to drag the information out.<eos> You filled her and all of her friends' heads with lies.
You drastically misrepresented the reality of the case.<eos> - So?<eos> - So? !<eos> You took advantage of Mrs. Landry.<eos> Does she know how much money you're gonna make?
If the only thing standing between me and a million bucks is some old lady's tears... - then I suggest investing in Kleenex.<eos> - You ruined her life...<eos> - because you wanted your money faster. - Boo and hoo.<eos> Besides, not like she's got that much time left, anyway.<eos> You're disgusting.
Oh, cos our Peter's been bunking off school.<eos> But you're a good mum.<eos> Single mum though, so council think I need to prove it.<eos> I'm really rubbish.<eos> Just cos you've got kids off different dads?
Can we clear this room please?<eos> But we're family.<eos> We're supporting Craig.<eos> Yeah. And Karen.<eos> And you are?
All right.<eos> It's vital that you let us control the media side of things.<eos> I keep saying, I'm sorry!<eos> Oh, Karen, don't upset yourself.<eos> And who are you?
Shannon doesn't just belong to Karen and her family, she belongs to all of us!<eos> Yeah!<eos> We'll do whatever it takes to find her and bring her home safe!<eos> The harrowing 999 call made by Karen Matthews...<eos> So, you've currently got four children living at home with you?
Yeah, she has.<eos> Is that right, Karen?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You originally told us you had six kids.<eos> If you've four living here, and three elsewhere, that makes seven.
Hello?<eos> We're at the house again now.<eos> Yeah, we'll report to you as soon as we're back.<eos> I just love that ringtone.<eos> You see, when you say you all sat round the table as a family and had breakfast, before waving Shannon off to school, telling her you loved her, it's not quite ringing true, Karen.
You see, when you say you all sat round the table as a family and had breakfast, before waving Shannon off to school, telling her you loved her, it's not quite ringing true, Karen.<eos> Why not?<eos> Because most people don't live like that.<eos> I certainly don't.<eos> Well, you're all right.
It were easier when I did it t'first time.<eos> I've sort of... got used to her not being around.<eos> I understand.<eos> Anyway, I've got my cuddly bear.<eos> Like... like you wanted.
You'd think so.<eos> And I wouldn't even sit on someone else's knee when I'm wi' Craig.<eos> Especially a bloke like Mick Donovan.<eos> So you do know him.<eos> You must have been surprised when you heard where Shannon had been found?
Get on great.<eos> I'm a top stepdad.<eos> We've charged Mick Donovan with Shannon's abduction.<eos> Well, that's it, then.<eos> But he's telling us you were in on it with him.
That you agreed he'd pick Shannon up from school, keep her at his flat, and split the reward money.<eos> Well, he's lying, then, isn't he?<eos> I weren't even in on it.<eos> Didn't even know where he lived nor nowt.<eos> But earlier, you said you didn't even know Donovan, now you've admitted you do.
I don't get it.<eos> Well, to be honest, there's a lot we don't get, too...<eos> Look, I know you're Karen's mate, but if there's ever anything you think we should know...<eos> Yeah, well, like you say, she's me mate.<eos> And you're loyal to your mates, I'm sure.
Look, I have told you everything I know and everything I've seen.<eos> And I can tell you're not happy.<eos> I mean, we've both seen things that have made us suspicious.<eos> We both think she knows more than she's saying.<eos> Yeah, but you're the copper.
You, you're still me friend?<eos> Julie? !<eos> Julie?<eos> Karen Matthews, you are charged, firstly, that between the 18th of February and the 15th of March, 2008, having responsibility for a child, namely Shannon Matthews, you wilfully neglected or abandoned the said child in a manner likely to cause unnecessary suffering or injury to her health.<eos> Secondly, that between the 18th of February and the 15th of March, 2008, at Dewsbury, contrary to Common Law, you did pervert the course of public justice by repeatedly concealing information as to the whereabouts of Shannon Matthews.
Will you still forgive me?<eos> So, rather than tell this court the truth, Miss Matthews, you have simply come up with more lies.<eos> No, I haven't.<eos> You have, in fact, changed your story several times.<eos> You're twisting it all round.
I put it to you that you and Donovan hatched the plan to abduct Shannon, together.<eos> And when the reward money reached a certain figure, you and<eos> Michael Donovan agreed he would take Shannon to Dewsbury Police Station, claiming he had found her on the market?<eos> It's not true.<eos> Instead of admitting it, you've tried to implicate everyone except yourself.
"How could you have done that to your own child?"<eos> "How could you have told such a pack of lies to people" "you called friends?"<eos> Quiet, please.<eos> Julie Bushby.<eos> Mrs Bushby, you are about to give evidence as a witness, but prior to that, you have been asked to make a brief assessment about the character of Miss Matthews.
I got the job!<eos> They offered it to me on the spot!<eos> I should call my mom.<eos> She's gonna be thrilled.<eos> You know, between you and me, I was never the favorite.
Nora, it's okay.<eos> I'm going to call the ambulance, and you're going to give me that glass.<eos> Nora, look at me.<eos> Look at me.<eos> You were wrong.
I thought...<eos> I don't...<eos> I-I don't know how to start this.<eos> Are you looking for a psychiatrist?<eos> I was in a bad accident... severely injured, and they tell me that you're the best at this kind of thing.
Much.<eos> You don't believe in me.<eos> Oh.<eos> Hello.<eos> You must be Alex.
Well, Alex, that's what therapy is.<eos> We listen... and then we analyze and treat.<eos> I want someone to tell me how to live with this.<eos> Well, I'm not a life coach.<eos> You open up, and we talk.
I do.<eos> Um, I've, uh...<eos> You've what?<eos> - I've...<eos> - You've what?
I'm sorry.<eos> You were wrong.<eos> No!<eos> You were wrong.<eos> You did this to me.
Someone did this to me.<eos> All of this.<eos> Nora, you mean, or Nora's ghost?<eos> This isn't what we're here for, but I'm gonna humor you.<eos> Nora Green, who was dead by the time you turned homicidal, broke into your house, injected you with a drug cocktail, left, hung herself, and decayed.
This isn't what we're here for, but I'm gonna humor you.<eos> Nora Green, who was dead by the time you turned homicidal, broke into your house, injected you with a drug cocktail, left, hung herself, and decayed.<eos> Do you belittle all your patients?<eos> No, no, no, I'm just trying to make you understand so that we can start your therapy.<eos> Isn't that what you do, the, uh, confrontation technique?
You help no one.<eos> Nora's reality was so distorted by the time she got here, she couldn't tell the difference between what was real and what wasn't.<eos> She was convinced her father was dead, and the entire time I'm sitting there, looking at this girl, feeling so bad that she's being manipulated by... an unstable physician.<eos> Say that part again.<eos> You don't help anyone.
I've been trying to find a way... to sneak you out of that place.<eos> Sitting in that parking lot every day, and... You come running out!<eos> It was a Christmas miracle!<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> You forced your way into our lives.
Of course you did.<eos> He knew exactly what was going on.<eos> That's why he's alive.<eos> Or your... your... your best friend.<eos> She just wanted you to open up.
Or your... your... your best friend.<eos> She just wanted you to open up.<eos> And Terry?<eos> A guy you pay to sit in a room and reveal nothing.<eos> You had no problem talking to me about Nora.
And Terry?<eos> A guy you pay to sit in a room and reveal nothing.<eos> You had no problem talking to me about Nora.<eos> We were happy.<eos> Happier than you've ever been.
When my parents died, I was young.<eos> I was alone, and I ran from this house.<eos> Trying to be what they would have wanted.<eos> But you failed.<eos> Just like you failed to keep your hands off your own flesh and blood!
Tell me something.<eos> What did you see... the night you slashed up your boyfriend?<eos> I saw Nora.<eos> That's perfect.<eos> I saw what you made of her.
What happened to you?<eos> Terry was first.<eos> He died of a heart attack midway through.<eos> But I learned a lot from Clara.<eos> And you're next.
How long can you keep torturing him?<eos> As long as it takes.<eos> If you want the truth, why not just use the soul sword?<eos> You're telling me how to do my job?<eos> No, but you said you retrieved the sword right after the attack.
That guy.<eos> This way.<eos> Astonishing.<eos> It's really you.<eos> Yeah, it's me. Who are you?
Now, if Mr. Snart was able to bond with that blast, the version of him you're now seeing could be...<eos> Um, how will I put this?<eos> - Like a time-ghost?<eos> - Precisely.<eos> But what I want to know is how did someone manage to put a device inside your brain without you knowing it?
Thank God.<eos> I don't think it's here.<eos> All right, Spec-y four-eyes. I'm starting to lose my patience with you. Where is the spear?<eos> What spear?<eos> We had a little chat with the members of your film crew, and they all claimed the Spear of Destiny was a prop, and that you, Mr. Lucas, were its master.
Right. You know I was bluffing, right?<eos> I am not actually Rip Hunter.<eos> My name is Phil. I am a full-time film student and part-time recreational drug user.<eos> Seriously regretting the latter.<eos> Oh, I know exactly who you are.
Mmm.<eos> Also, I think your children are angry with you.<eos> - Mr. Cobblepot.<eos> - It's understandable.<eos> You made them what they are, then abandoned them.
And when your dad found you, how he cried.<eos> That's real.<eos> Yes... your parents died in that alley three years ago and maybe that man took away the pain of that night.<eos> But there is no life, there is no love without pain.<eos> He could not touch the love that your mom and dad gave you, that you still have it in you, that you still have in here.
The same love that I have for you.<eos> I love you, Master Bruce.<eos> I would do anything for you.<eos> I would die for you.<eos> You must... find that love again.
He's wrong.<eos> Master Bruce, there's no other way to put it.<eos> He's wrong.<eos> Your destiny is to be Bruce Wayne.<eos> And one day, you're gonna remember that.
You got to find your own path.<eos> I'm not like you.<eos> You've always been so sure of who you are.<eos> Oh, I don't know about that.<eos> I've been through some very dark places, as have you.
You've been here for just few months, and already you think you know everything.<eos> Did it not occur to you that I could<eos> I--i don't believe that.<eos> Of course you don't because you don't understand that circumstances are what makes a thing poison or nectar.<eos> You believe your fool's errand because you think that you are for this darkness that's inside you.
Were any prints found on the scissors?<eos> Father Tabakian's.<eos> What was your initial assessment at the scene?<eos> That they had quarreled over the money, that Mrs. Allen had struck Father Tabakian with the trophy, and then planted the scissors in his hand to make it look like self-defense.<eos> Detective, your partner testified that you told him from the beginning you believed the scissors were planted.
Detective, weren't you a defendant in a civil suit where you were accused of planting evidence? Yes.<eos> What was the outcome of that lawsuit?<eos> The jury found for the plaintiff.<eos> Nothing further.<eos> Detective, did the jury in that case conclude that you had planted evidence?
And how did he respond?<eos> He defended her.<eos> She was so innocent, so pure.<eos> He didn't believe me.<eos> What did you do then?
Take your time.<eos> Thank you.<eos> He began... pushing me toward the door.<eos> And he... He picked up a pair of scissors, and... came at me again.<eos> What did you do?
Could've backfired.<eos> Mrs. Allen was a compelling witness.<eos> What's your gut?<eos> We'll see.<eos> I thought Amanda did the best she could on the redirect, given that you did lose that case, dollar or no dollar.
Trust me. The District Attorney will weigh the odds - and cut his losses.<eos> - The DA will re-try.<eos> I'll make it my mission.<eos> You are a dog with a bone.<eos> And you, Mrs. Allen, are a liar and a murderer.
I honestly don't know what to do.<eos> Well, Stef's right, you can't quit and let Drew take over Anchor Beach.<eos> - Not after all you put into it.<eos> - Well, I don't think you should, either.<eos> Resign, I mean, you haven't yet, have you?
Hmm, sorry to hear that.<eos> - You were together how long?<eos> - A few years.<eos> Can you be more specific?<eos> Because according to your ex-husband, you and Troy started having an affair about five years ago.
- I didn't.<eos> - But you do know that falsifying evidence is a felony, right?<eos> And if we end up proving that you lied, you go to jail.<eos> So I want you to think very carefully before you answer this.<eos> Do you swear that Troy Johnson was at work that day as you stated to the police at the time?
Why are you doing this? !<eos> Nick doesn't even go to school here anymore.<eos> Whose fault is that?<eos> You know everything that happened with Nick is because of you.<eos> You're the reason, he... he stalked me, and he broke into my house.
Nick doesn't even go to school here anymore.<eos> Whose fault is that?<eos> You know everything that happened with Nick is because of you.<eos> You're the reason, he... he stalked me, and he broke into my house.<eos> You're the reason he could have hurt everyone in this school!
Whose fault is that?<eos> You know everything that happened with Nick is because of you.<eos> You're the reason, he... he stalked me, and he broke into my house.<eos> You're the reason he could have hurt everyone in this school!<eos> And you're the reason he almost killed himself.
I was wondering if the D.A. might have a second to chat.<eos> Save your energy, Ms. Williams.<eos> I know you're doing a story on the death of Detective Malone.<eos> I have no comment for you.<eos> And yet everyone I spoke to you said you were the man to speak to.
No, unfortunately.<eos> But they're fairly confident that he targeted city hall because of our inability to enact the SCGR.<eos> You implying I'm somehow responsible for what happened?<eos> No.<eos> But, councilwoman, you did kill the ordinance.
Laurel Lance was my friend.<eos> Nobody respects the rights of someone to protect themselves and the people that they care for more than me, but everything in life comes with limitations.<eos> Everything.<eos> Why are you telling me this?<eos> Because you and I are gonna sit in this office until we figure out a reasonable set of limitations that respects everyone's rights.
Well, I am here simply to ask you for his name.<eos> And what happens when you find him?<eos> He needs help.<eos> He--I want him to get that help.<eos> What you want... is to cage him up like an animal, like the animal who killed his father.
Leaving whether I agree with that aside, why should I believe whatever he says?<eos> Because you know as well as I do what he has done for this city.<eos> But what's the simpler answer?<eos> That the Green Arrow all of a sudden out of nowhere became a--a cop killer?<eos> Or that he was manipulated by a psychopath who has had all of us, you included, running in circles for months?
Did mayor Queen say why?<eos> He said the Throwing Star Killer, a man we'd been calling Prometheus, manipulated him.<eos> Did he say why this Prometheus would want to orchestrate Detective Malone's murder?<eos> No.<eos> Standing here today, do you believe what Mr. Queen has told you?
- Mrs. Chase.<eos> What are you doing in my hou...<eos> Mrs. Chase, I'm not gonna hurt you.<eos> Get away from me.<eos> Your husband isn't who you think he is.
And she works for Kovar.<eos> Maybe she heard something.<eos> Your boss?<eos> You... you work for Konstantin Kovar.<eos> He said you were enemy.
It's regarding the recent reports about our father.<eos> I never had the opportunity to meet him.<eos> But your father did some remarkable things for this city.<eos> What's happening with his reputation right now is simply terrible, but I can't understand what it could have to do with me.<eos> Reportedly, you were the last person seen with councilman Goodwin.
- Adrian Chase.<eos> Or as I knew him, Simon Morrison.<eos> You've been in contact with him?<eos> Why didn't you alert the SCPD?<eos> You've met him.
He said you'd seek me out and that when you did I should give you that.<eos> He said it proves the kind of man your father truly was.<eos> I know what kind of man our father was.<eos> And he was nowhere close to Chase's father.<eos> You were Justin Claybourne's lawyer.
- Okay, let's get to bed huh?<eos> Hello?<eos> - Saw you at the bar tonight, sorry I had to leave so suddenly.<eos> - How'd you get this number?<eos> - Sister started to backslide, you had a chance to stay out of it, but now it's too late.
- Can I help you sir?<eos> - I'm not sure if you can, do you have father James burk as one of your patients?<eos> - Excuse me sir.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - You're looking for father burk.
- Yes, in certain instances the demonic phenomena will attach itself to an inanimate object.<eos> - Like a talking doll?<eos> - There's nothing funny about demonic phenomena.<eos> Now, you can come up with your own theories that you might consider less fantastical to explain away our findings, you can call us frauds if you wish, or you can see things for what they are.<eos> If you employ a little thing called faith.
Westbrook building is clear.<eos> I'm gonna head to Chalmers Street.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Copy that.<eos> Who are you?
Copy that.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Mrs. LaBelle, I am Detective John Cardinal.<eos> I told him not to go in.<eos> Told him to wait until I got back but, you know, he's such a water rat.
Mrs. LaBelle, I am Detective John Cardinal.<eos> I told him not to go in.<eos> Told him to wait until I got back but, you know, he's such a water rat.<eos> That's all he ever wanted to do.<eos> So you're there, for about an hour and then you go back up to the car for cigarettes.
I'm wondering if there's any new information since?<eos> I see. So he was seen in St. John's?<eos> I'm gonna show you some pictures.<eos> Can you tell me if...?<eos> Well, if you hear anything more, will you let me know right away?
Let her do her job, Phil.<eos> Says it's been going on for months and you guys are nowhere on it.<eos> I'm afraid I can't talk about other cases.<eos> Guess everyone'll be focused on Katie Pine now.<eos> Kinda surprised you're here at all.
Do you know where he was going?<eos> If he was travelling with anyone?<eos> Well, like I say, we try to keep them fed and warm, no questions asked.<eos> I recognize you, don't I?<eos> You attended service for a while?
I noticed all the skis.<eos> Well, they're mine.<eos> Three different sizes.<eos> Different conditions.<eos> Well if you do hear that noise, Mr...?
Slugging it out with a stealth is not gonna get it done.<eos> If you want to take that station, you need to land an assault team.<eos> Do you have any idea of the resistance inside?<eos> No, we don't. That's why we're talking to you.<eos> You're the military genius.
Here, I'll get the ball rolling.<eos> I'm a smug old bitch, who enjoys playing with life and death on her big chessboard.<eos> A snake in a sari...<eos> With dead eyes and a poison tongue and the solar system is in tatters because of people like you and Errinwright.<eos> Despite your delusions to the contrary, you, madam undersecretary, may be the worst person I have ever met.
Hey, don't worry about it, okay?<eos> Allison, right?<eos> Oh, we just wanted to introduce ourselves.<eos> - Oh, hey.<eos> - Oh, and you are?
They're nothing but rocks and bird shit and...<eos> And a lot of very unattractive people.<eos> The Iron Fleet, on the other hand, that's something else entirely.<eos> It's the greatest armada Westeros has ever seen.<eos> With the Iron Fleet, you own the seas.
I was wondering if you had considered my proposition.<eos> I don't remember your proposition.<eos> I asked you if, in light of what I've seen in the North, if I could have access to the restricted area of the library.<eos> That area is reserved for maesters.<eos> - Are you a maester?
Too many similarities from unconnected sources.<eos> Sources in the restricted area?<eos> The very same.<eos> And the simplest explanation for your grating obsession with the white walkers is that you're telling the truth and that you saw what you say you saw.<eos> So, you believe me.
( cart wheels squeaking )<eos> ( door opens )<eos> Hello.<eos> - What are you doing? - ( door closes )<eos> You're Jorah Mormont, the only son of Jeor Mormont.
Just enough.<eos> That's all Mr. Wednesday needs... Just enough.<eos> Maybe just one.<eos> Your boss doesn't seem to have an I.D., record, somehow even a name.<eos> You got all those, Mr. Moon, record especially.
You can go home.<eos> Okay, boss.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> If it was up to me, you'd be dead.<eos> So from humble errand boy to kitchen worker to the so-called "King of Gotham," it is said that many died so you could rise.
Previously on Gotham...<eos> I demand that you arrest Detective Gordon for the murder of my husband.<eos> You talk of hate and revenge, but you still love James Gordon.
That's great.<eos> That's all this city needs...<eos> Jerome Valeska sucking air with 50 fanatics at his back.<eos> Lucius.<eos> If you wanted to bring back someone from one of these, what would be your next step?
The James Gordon.<eos> Wow.<eos> It's actually you.<eos> So cool I'm meeting you.<eos> You should thank your friends.
Stop what?<eos> The night of the awakening.<eos> You mean waking up Jerome?<eos> Jerome is just the first step.<eos> You think we're a small band.
Who cares what people think of the mayor?<eos> The city runs itself.<eos> I'm talking about your other job.<eos> The real one.<eos> You melt down in public, hide out here, people start to smell blood in the water.
I get to keep breathing.<eos> 1:00, my place.<eos> Are you sure about this?<eos> Of course.<eos> You saved our lives.
Just call the cops and get his ass arrested.<eos> And what about your mom?<eos> I mean, a weasel he most definitely is, but if what he says is true, she could go to jail.<eos> And isn't that why you have lawyers?<eos> You pay a guy like Cole, all that happens is he comes back again.
They're all over the city.<eos> Maybe they were here the whole time and we just didn't notice.<eos> Seems most are concentrated in the Narrows, rougher parts of town.<eos> Abandoned buildings, warehouses.<eos> You're thinking this is how they communicate?
Three times.<eos> Look, you have spent the last year telling everyone that the Prophet would return.<eos> People have made sacrifices for you, Dwight.<eos> I left a really good job at the post office.<eos> The police are coming, and you promised them Jerome.
People have made sacrifices for you, Dwight.<eos> I left a really good job at the post office.<eos> The police are coming, and you promised them Jerome.<eos> The others expect to hear him speak.<eos> They want to see his face and if you can't do that...
I left a really good job at the post office.<eos> The police are coming, and you promised them Jerome.<eos> The others expect to hear him speak.<eos> They want to see his face and if you can't do that...<eos> You know, you make an interesting point.
This is a rebellion.<eos> Well, don't say I didn't warn you.<eos> But...<eos> I did warn ya.<eos> You have been such a friend, Barbara.
The GCPD has asked us to evacuate the building.<eos> They assure me that everything is under control.<eos> No one's going anywhere.<eos> We've got a show to do, people.<eos> And, as you know, the show must go on.
We've got a show to do, people.<eos> And, as you know, the show must go on.<eos> What the...<eos> Well, that is quite a story.<eos> You know, I know I've been dead, but doesn't that seem kind of crazy to you?
And, as you know, the show must go on.<eos> What the...<eos> Well, that is quite a story.<eos> You know, I know I've been dead, but doesn't that seem kind of crazy to you?<eos> Hey, maybe you're dreaming.
You are, aren't you?<eos> Goody!<eos> The cult will never follow you, Dwight.<eos> I saw you, at the theater?<eos> You don't have what it takes.
I haven't touched a hair on your pretty girlfriend's head.<eos> You're just repeating what Jerome said to me last year.<eos> I am Jerome.<eos> No, no.<eos> You're the understudy pretending to be the star.
He knew how to get Penguin to turn on the five families.<eos> Poor Ozzie is tearing apart everything he built.<eos> Remember, when this is over, and we're in charge,<eos> Nygma dies.<eos> You made a promise.
No charisma, no stage presence.<eos> The time has come to reveal ourselves.<eos> Though he is a handsome fellow?<eos> Hey, Doc, keep watching.<eos> You don't want to miss what happens next.
Did you know?<eos> !<eos> Yes.<eos> It was obvious.<eos> And you gave her the money anyway?
The money wasn't important.<eos> She was lying!<eos> What were my options, Selina?<eos> If I didn't give her the money, she would've skipped town.<eos> So, you thought you'd pay her.
This guy's hilarious.<eos> So... how's it look?<eos> It's good.<eos> It looks good.<eos> You wouldn't lie to me, right, Dwight?
Ed, is that really you?<eos> Are-Are you okay?<eos> I... I can't talk long.<eos> I snuck away to the phone.<eos> Ed, who has you?
You weren't kidnapped?<eos> Not unless you count kidnapping yourself.<eos> Recognize it?<eos> Oh, why should you?<eos> I doubt you did the deed yourself.
This thing just keeps getting bigger.<eos> It's not just the cult anymore.<eos> Ordinary citizens are taking Jerome's cue.<eos> Meanwhile, Cobblepot's MIA.<eos> You call down to city hall, and literally no one's in charge.
- Yes!<eos> - I confess.<eos> I had her killed.<eos> But guess what?<eos> You should thank me because we both know what would have happened if I hadn't.
I could have lived a life with the woman I loved.<eos> I could have been happy.<eos> No, Ed.<eos> You would have killed her.<eos> Just like you did the other one!
It's about putting someone else's needs and happiness before your own.<eos> Ed, please...<eos> 'Cause the truth is, Oswald, you would sacrifice anyone to save your own neck.<eos> Even me.<eos> Now, if you'll look above us, you will see a cauldron of highly corrosive acid, which is currently being held in place by this chain.
Are you okay?<eos> I'll be fine, Master Bruce.<eos> I'll be fine.<eos> Nice place you got here.<eos> You rent?
The idea of slitting that pretty, pink throat of yours.<eos> Figure that'd clear the decks.<eos> What do you think, huh?<eos> I remember that night...<eos> When you took over the benefit.
Jerome was raised in a circus.<eos> Have a strike force and all available units meet us there.<eos> I'll put out the call on the way.<eos> Let's roll.<eos> Got to be honest, Bruce, you don't make the world's funniest clown.
Think.<eos> What?<eos> I said think.<eos> Oh, I heard you.<eos> I'm just surprised you knew the word.
No!<eos> Sorry.<eos> Did that hurt?<eos> Not much.<eos> You try.
Like, weirder than normal.<eos> You're right.<eos> I should want him dead.<eos> "Should"?<eos> Oswald... you loved him, and he betrayed you.
Now does that mean I passed?<eos> - I... don't know what it means.<eos> I have to tell you... this is way more fun than I was expecting.<eos> We make a good team, you and me.<eos> You killed Alfred.
Do it.<eos> Alfred!<eos> Bruce!<eos> I thought you were dead.<eos> Can't get rid of me that easily, can you, mate?
I thought how proud I was of you.<eos> Of the man that you've become.<eos> I almost killed him, Alfred.<eos> Ah, but you didn't, now, did you?<eos> You controlled your anger.
Are you prepared?<eos> Yes.<eos> But I still don't understand how I can help save Gotham.<eos> Never fear.<eos> You are only part of the plan.
But I still don't understand how I can help save Gotham.<eos> Never fear.<eos> You are only part of the plan.<eos> Are you sure about this?<eos> You know what must happen if he refuses.
I don't love you.<eos> You need me, Edward Nygma.<eos> Just as I need you.<eos> You cannot have one without the other.<eos> You killed Isabella.
That is the point!<eos> You can't talk your way out of this, Oswald.<eos> I have wanted you to suffer as I've suffered.<eos> You killed her, so you die.<eos> When I met you you were a nervous, jittery loser.
Oh! Somebody help!<eos> The building's empty.<eos> No one's coming to help.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> Wh-Who are you?
And a clear conscience.<eos> Were you aiming for the window, Master Bruce?<eos> You keep distracting me.<eos> Well, you should be able to hit the target regardless, shouldn't you?<eos> I mean, you had rules about training, rules which would be impossible to stand by if you remain unfocused.
The Court doesn't mean you any harm.<eos> They have the highest regard for you.<eos> In fact, they want you to become a member.<eos> Peters, we got a tip from a guy who electrocuted a bunch of players at a fancy chess tournament, pointing us to a pawn on queens.<eos> Now, here, you work at a pawn shop on Queens Avenue.
And with that, it was over.<eos> Leaving me to wonder what mysterious forces are at play in the middle of the night.<eos> Captain Barnes.<eos> At last we meet.<eos> - Who are you?
At last we meet.<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - Let's just say I'm a fan.<eos> What do you want?<eos> The same thing you do, for Gotham to be judged and the guilty punished.
Do you think it's him?<eos> Mr. Fries.<eos> Welcome home.<eos> I see you still hold me responsible for all of that awful monster rhetoric I spewed during my campaign.<eos> You ran people like me out of Gotham.
You let me win, didn't you, Master Bruce?<eos> No way, Alfred.<eos> No way, my foot.<eos> That's very unlike you, isn't it?<eos> And to be honest, I mean, you haven't been yourself these past few days, have you?
She had to die as well?<eos> Why is Bruce Wayne here?<eos> He has come to pass judgment.<eos> Enough of this.<eos> You are the leader of the Court.
Mmm.<eos> Also, I think your children are angry with you.<eos> - Mr. Cobblepot.<eos> - It's understandable.<eos> You made them what they are, then abandoned them.
And when your dad found you, how he cried.<eos> That's real.<eos> Yes... your parents died in that alley three years ago and maybe that man took away the pain of that night.<eos> But there is no life, there is no love without pain.<eos> He could not touch the love that your mom and dad gave you, that you still have it in you, that you still have in here.
The same love that I have for you.<eos> I love you, Master Bruce.<eos> I would do anything for you.<eos> I would die for you.<eos> You must... find that love again.
He's wrong.<eos> Master Bruce, there's no other way to put it.<eos> He's wrong.<eos> Your destiny is to be Bruce Wayne.<eos> And one day, you're gonna remember that.
You got to find your own path.<eos> I'm not like you.<eos> You've always been so sure of who you are.<eos> Oh, I don't know about that.<eos> I've been through some very dark places, as have you.
Help!<eos> I'm trapped in here!<eos> We gotta get him out of here.<eos> This place is up in flames any second.<eos> You see the soot around this door?
Mm-hmm.<eos> I just don't see why you're defending the yellow guy.<eos> Yes, he goes everywhere The Flash goes, but this morning, for example, he's just standing back, waiting for the warehouse to burn down.<eos> Well, maybe he's training with The Flash.<eos> - You know, learning the ropes?
Before what?<eos> Before I hurt someone else... the way I hurt you.<eos> I don't cure meta-humans.<eos> I put them in prison.<eos> You're on your own, I'm afraid.
Um, yeah, but just one second.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Just, um... yeah... okay, open 'em.<eos> Um...<eos> I know you wanted to unpack slowly, like a normal couple, but I don't know... between our jobs and the S.T.A.R. Labs museum and... do you hate it?
- All right.<eos> - When he is, we'll be ready for him, though, right, Barry?<eos> No, not we, Wally.<eos> This... you're still training.<eos> Have you seen my times in the Speed Lab lately?
Hi.<eos> Come and take a seat.<eos> Look, I...<eos> I know I was... rude yesterday.<eos> Yeah, you were a world-class jerk.
Look, I...<eos> I know I was... rude yesterday.<eos> Yeah, you were a world-class jerk.<eos> Yeah, there is a reason.<eos> Because you are a world-class jerk?
I didn't ask for these powers, just like you didn't ask to be used by Savitar.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I just don't know how to move forward.<eos> Why don't you come join us at S.T.A.R. Labs?<eos> You can help Team Flash fight meta-humans.
Yeah, no, go ahead.<eos> Price is no object.<eos> Mm.<eos> - Hey. - How's it going?<eos> You know, S.T.A.R. Labs museum, gift that keeps on giving, so...
- Barry, cappuccino.<eos> - Hi, uh, no... uh, good.<eos> - Okay... all right.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - You know I'll double down.
- Yeah.<eos> Um, so this character... your character... uh, was he able to change his future?<eos> More specifically, if he allowed certain events to occur naturally, was he only cementing the very timeline that resulted in a horrible event later?<eos> There were two schools of thought.<eos> One faction... one group of fans... they believed, you know, the future's ever-changing.
This isn't working.<eos> I don't know why.<eos> You see this?<eos> Do you see what you've done, H.R.?<eos> You have distracted us for months, so what?
I don't know why.<eos> You see this?<eos> Do you see what you've done, H.R.?<eos> You have distracted us for months, so what?<eos> So that you could feel useful?
You see this?<eos> Do you see what you've done, H.R.?<eos> You have distracted us for months, so what?<eos> So that you could feel useful?<eos> You're not useful.
Joe and Iris, they took you in.<eos> Cisco, when Dante died,<eos> I slept on your couch to keep you company.<eos> The things we see, the things that we face... no one can do this alone.<eos> Trying is the biggest mistake that you can make.
The future isn't set.<eos> There's still hope.<eos> But, Barry, the future, it's harder to change than you can imagine.<eos> The future wants to happen.<eos> The way it was explained to me was, imagine if you had a row of dominos, okay?
Well, perhaps he did.<eos> Look, I came to this Earth seeking redemption, but I realize now, you're right.<eos> Greatness isn't in the cards for me.<eos> Okay.<eos> So you failed.
Okay.<eos> So you failed.<eos> So nobody came to your opening.<eos> Don't end it like this.<eos> Greatness takes time... and you know this.
Barry... I love you.<eos> Hey, no, don't say that, all right?<eos> H.R. is here. Me?<eos> Are you sure?<eos> - Yeah, you weren't here before.
They are running.<eos> Wally, take your next left.<eos> The streets meet up in about two miles.<eos> If you time it just right,<eos> - you'll be able to blindside him.
- Can't wait.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I called the local elementary school, and gave the principal discounted tickets.<eos> I figured, hey, you know, if the kids love it, they'll tell their parents, and, well, the rest writes itself.<eos> You, Francisco... are brilliant.
- Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, my God. - What?<eos> I forgot the ice.<eos> Instant party save.<eos> Baby, you've never been sexier.
This is a... it's for you.<eos> - Ah, thank you.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Um, yeah. So we all talked it over, and welcome to the team.<eos> You being serious?
Detective Joe West!<eos> Long time, no see.<eos> Do I know you?<eos> You don't remember me?<eos> You and your cronies had a very fun time ruining my life.
You and your cronies had a very fun time ruining my life.<eos> Not gonna let you do that this time around.<eos> I think you have the wrong guy.<eos> No, no.<eos> You're the Joe West I remember.
Not Joe West, I'm guessing.<eos> Digsy.<eos> Digsy Foss.<eos> I run this town.<eos> So you're the mayor?
You don't understand!<eos> I couldn't do what the man said.<eos> What man?<eos> The man said he would kill that kid if I didn't cut my face.<eos> Mr. Johnny Kane, you're an amazing actor with an impressive library of films under your belt.
- What other one?<eos> - This one, sent an hour ago.<eos> It wasn't me.<eos> Dr. Gwendolyn Scott.<eos> You're a world-renowned thoracic surgeon.
I was afraid.<eos> It's okay, Doctor.<eos> We're here now.<eos> Can I ask you something, Detective?<eos> What would you do?
To finish my experiment without interference, but here we are...<eos> Your experiment failed, Professor.<eos> We proved your theory wrong.<eos> The doctor chose to save the girl.<eos> So, clearly, not everyone's as egregiously selfish as you are.
Time for you to make a choice.<eos> In this vial, an antidote that will save Benji's life.<eos> In vial numero dos, poisonous gas that will kill you if you enter the room.<eos> Simple, really...<eos> You decide what's more important.
Nothing's gettin' through this sucker.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So, you're here about Sara.<eos> Yes, your waitress.<eos> In this article, you said, you said that she was killed by an alien.
Making some progress.<eos> Come in, Mr. rawlings.<eos> You are aware that lady bevell feels that they are hopeless.<eos> I'm the one cleaning up her mess.<eos> Dr. hess, last I heard, you and the rest of the leadership felt getting the winchesters was key to bringing the American hunters on board.
It's an outrage.<eos> It's been almost four hours, for God's sake!<eos> Let's go ahead and welcome our next guest, Dr. Lawrence Manning.<eos> Thank you for having me.<eos> Doctor, you're claiming to have experienced direct contact with the visitors as you refer to them.
If it happened at the party, that's a long list of people to eliminate.<eos> There were 50 men at your party on Saturday night?<eos> Yeah.<eos> At least 50.<eos> - Wessex Police. Who are you?
Just the same stuff we always argue about.<eos> Erm... the way he runs the shop, my wife's shift patterns, the refugee crisis.<eos> Yeah, mostly shift patterns.<eos> He's, erm... a knob.<eos> And how long have you and Cath been married?
Can we just focus on the ex-husband?<eos> We're investigating a serious sexual assault that took place at Axehampton House on Saturday night.<eos> Bloody hell.<eos> What, at... at Cath Atwood's party?<eos> You were there, we understand.
So she left first.<eos> She got a taxi, I think.<eos> In fact, I know she did, because she had the same driver who'd brought Trish to the party earlier in the evening.<eos> She said she couldn't escape me, even on the way home.<eos> And did you have much to drink?
Trish Winterman of West Flintcombe has made an allegation of rape.<eos> What, so you come for the cab driver?<eos> Where were you on Saturday night, Leo?<eos> I was out with my girlfriend.<eos> - Wessex Police. Who are you?
That's probably it.<eos> Why are you lying to us, Lucas?<eos> Sorry?<eos> We called all those people.<eos> You didn't take any of them.
Can I see your fishing equipment?<eos> Welcome to the man cave.<eos> I try and work out, you know.<eos> An hour or two a day, keeps my head clear.<eos> - Do you work out?
We were in bed together.<eos> On the morning of your wife's birthday?<eos> She was at work. Erm... An early shift.<eos> Right.<eos> Is that the first time you and Trish have slept together?
I didn't send any bloody text!<eos> - Well, someone did.<eos> - Yeah, that was possibly me.<eos> Sarah, please say you didn't.<eos> Who are you?
We've checked the CCTV.<eos> Your car didn't go that route in either direction, any time between Saturday afternoon and Sunday afternoon.<eos> You must've missed me.<eos> We're pretty thorough.<eos> You said there were another two men fishing on Saturday.
- Mackerel.<eos> - How many?<eos> Dozen or so.<eos> It's not difficult.<eos> You could probably do it.
So we had about six or seven.<eos> What did you do with the others?<eos> Froze them. Why, do you want a couple?<eos> No.<eos> So, if we were to go to your house now, your wife would confirm and back up that you cooked her fresh mackerel on Sunday.
- We're not after ice cream.<eos> - Speak for yourself.<eos> DS Miller, DI Hardy, Wessex Police.<eos> Oh, OK.<eos> Where were you on the night of Saturday 28th May?
- Oh, typical!<eos> A woman gets attacked and the men go round butting horns, making it about them.<eos> - What are you two doing here?<eos> - Take a wild guess.<eos> Jim Atwood claims that you attacked him at his garage earlier this evening.
Yeah, I am.<eos> You are in so much shit when I get back here.<eos> So Cath Atwood asked you to beat up her husband?<eos> No.<eos> - She knew you were going to?
- It's not what you think.<eos> I've barely seen him in the last 12 years.<eos> We're not that close.<eos> But he says he's not a rapist and you take him at face value and you omit to share that with anyone.<eos> You've never liked me, have you, Ellie?
These aren't romantic photos, Ed.<eos> They're obsessional ones.<eos> You're wrong.<eos> You wanna turn it into something it's not.<eos> Oh, I think that's what you want to do.
- I'm not obsessed!<eos> Yeah, you are.<eos> You're an obsessive loser with a short fuse, aren't you, Ed?<eos> That's why you attacked Jim Atwood, isn't it?<eos> Cos he got a taste of what you've never managed.
The day of the party...<eos> Trish and me, we were in bed together.<eos> I didn't do it.<eos> You know that, don't you?<eos> Wessex Police. Who are you?
How is he allowed to control our lives like this?<eos> Jim, can you tell me where you were on Thursday 28th of May, 2015?<eos> That's over a year ago.<eos> How do you expect me to remember that?<eos> Were you in the area?
I think the official term is spyware... on it.<eos> You've been snooping on your wife via her laptop?<eos> It gave me access to her webcam.<eos> So I could check in on her and see what she was up to.<eos> Why would you wanna do that?
- What?<eos> - 15 minutes ago,<eos> I got emailed a forensic breakdown of the contents of that computer.<eos> The spyware wasn't installed using Trish's user account.<eos> Didn't get installed the way you described.
We're trying to find the person responsible.<eos> What's the matter with you?<eos> Do you have no shame?<eos> All right.<eos> Here's what you're gonna do.
What's the matter with you?<eos> Do you have no shame?<eos> All right.<eos> Here's what you're gonna do.<eos> You're gonna take a long walk and a few deep breaths, and then you'll call us, and give us the name of the person who installed that spyware for you.
And there are condoms missing from that packet.<eos> When did you use the condoms, Jim?<eos> Who did you use them with?<eos> Your wife also confirmed that she was away on those other two nights when women were attacked.<eos> So, unless you tell us otherwise, you don't have alibis for those nights.
When did you use the condoms, Jim?<eos> Who did you use them with?<eos> Your wife also confirmed that she was away on those other two nights when women were attacked.<eos> So, unless you tell us otherwise, you don't have alibis for those nights.<eos> Starts to look like you're responsible.
You don't tell me what I can or can't do any more.<eos> Evening, Clive.<eos> - What you doing here?<eos> - Clive Lucas, I'm arresting you in connection with the rape of Patricia Winterman, committed at Axehampton House on Saturday 28th May this year.<eos> You do not have to say anything but it may harm your defence if you do not mention, when questioned, something which you later rely on in court.
Did none of them ever ask if you'd found their keys?<eos> What was it?<eos> Was it the power?<eos> Of knowing you have them?<eos> Knowing you could use them if you wanted?
No, we weren't aware of that. What time was that?<eos> 10ish, I suppose.<eos> She told him to stay away from her.<eos> I don't know why you keep coming for me when he's out there.<eos> Hm. You weren't there at that time.
So we believe that was used to gag her while she was raped.<eos> And when we tested it, it came back as a match with your DNA.<eos> It...<eos> - It's not mine.<eos> - We know you and Trish previously went for a drink and she knocked you back.
I'm sorry.<eos> For the tape, please.<eos> - No, I don't.<eos> - You do know!<eos> You know that number and you know what happened that night.
one against Laura Benson and two identities unknown at this stage on or before the 28th of May, 2016.<eos> And an extension to your custody time has been authorised.<eos> We found the weapon used to assault the victim, a child's cricket bat, during a search of your office at Humphries Nets.<eos> Preliminary forensics have identified your prints on the bat along with those of Michael Lucas and the blood of the victim.<eos> In addition, we have CCTV footage of you dumping a bag in a shed at Flintcombe Farm Shop.

Proud.<eos> What about the women?<eos> Did you stop to think how they felt?<eos> Not really.<eos> But you knew it was wrong and illegal?
But once you've had a taste, it's... it's hard.<eos> Kept thinking I was gonna get caught.<eos> When it wasn't in the news and nobody came,<eos> I wanted that feeling again.<eos> Did you know the names of the other two women you attacked?
- Your friend?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Lord, I swear, you shall never hear from him again.<eos> Perhaps I should make an ally of Kjartan, once again.<eos> Maybe he will succeed where you have so wilfully failed.
- Lord, I beg you...<eos> My business here is over.<eos> Goodbye, Lord Aelfric, so nice to meet you.<eos> Enjoy the long walk home to Bebbanburg.<eos> Guthred, by saving Uhtred, what you now have is a chaos of your own making.
The tragedy is that he was the victim of a hate crime.<eos> Every weekend, young men are pulled out of those clubs on stretchers, veins full of street drugs, hearts full of despair.<eos> What are you doing about that?<eos> We're here to lead the lost out of the wilderness.<eos> And if you don't mind me saying so, Detective Inspector Harry, you look like one of the lost with your tired eyes and that haunted expression.
Ah! So, you spent your nights at the tables.<eos> That's the devil's pact you've made to give you succour.<eos> If we find evidence that incriminates Sean Blake in Kevin Jones' death, it will implicate you in murder.<eos> Ooh! I can see I've touched a nerve.<eos> You won't find a solution to your self-loathing in the roll of a dice, Harry.
And we need to ask you where you were this evening.<eos> At home with the kids.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> What am I going to say to them?<eos> And if you don't mind me saying so, Detective Inspector Harry, you look like one of the lost, with your tired eyes and that haunted expression.
Is there really anyone here who believes themselves a match for Satan and all his words?<eos> Is there anyone here with an ego that big?<eos> Anthony Huxley, I need you to accompany us to the station.<eos> And why is that?<eos> It's not a conversation you want to have in public.
Hello.<eos> - I can't help you.<eos> - Well, I haven't asked yet.<eos> I might be looking for 40 kilos of lambs' brains.<eos> You're a cop.
- I said file.<eos> Allow me to introduce myself, because, as you can see from my mole, we've never met before.<eos> As you can see from my coat, hat and ascot, I'm here on business.<eos> And as you can see from my sunglasses... it's bright out.<eos> I'm here to consult with you on the Baudelaire will, for which I understand you are the executioner.
Yes, as one legal scholar to another?<eos> "The only nuptial requirements are a statement of active acquiescence by both participants, utilizing in loco parentis if necessary, and the signing of an explanatory document in the bride's own hand."<eos> Does that mean what I think it means?<eos> Well, I suppose it depends upon what you think it means.<eos> It means you're going to be a star.
- The curtain rises.<eos> - Curtain?<eos> - The audience applauds.<eos> - Audience!<eos> And you walk onto stage, dressed as a judge.
I get to share the stage with Count Olaf?<eos> while a stunningly-costumed bride, played by Violet, stands beside me.<eos> You are so lucky, Violet.<eos> All my life I wanted to be a bride, but it seems all the men I meet are intimidated by my law degree, or obsessed with model trains.<eos> A gorgeous... bridal dress of my own design... while you perform the entire wedding ceremony, getting each and every word exactly right, while we sign a document which you shall bring from city hall for added realism.
A man like me can acquire any number of beautiful women who don't complain about doing their chores.<eos> What's in it for me?<eos> "A legal husband has titular and practical control over any relevant fiduciaries, resulting in aggregate financial dominion over any spousal holdings."<eos> I don't think a boy your age ought to be using the word "titular."<eos> If you became Violet's husband, you'd gain complete control over the Baudelaire fortune.
Come now.<eos> Would it be so terrible to be my bride, to live in my house for the rest of your life?<eos> You're such a lovely girl.<eos> After the wedding, I wouldn't dispose of you like your brother and sister.<eos> If you let Sunny go... - I will marry you. - Hmm.
By the Gardens of Worthington, if I can't have him, my heart will literally break.<eos> Figuratively. "My heart will figuratively break."<eos> Why, what handsome adventures I have had, only to end up at this same pond on this... my wedding day!<eos> Say your line.<eos> Do you... take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife?
Why, what handsome adventures I have had, only to end up at this same pond on this... my wedding day!<eos> Say your line.<eos> Do you... take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife?<eos> I do.<eos> - Do you take this woman...
- Literally.<eos> - I said literally.<eos> I'm afraid this marriage is entirely binding.<eos> Violet... you said "I do" and signed this paper in your own hand.<eos> Count Olaf, you are now Violet's legal husband.
That moral argument had all the apocryphal insight of Thurgood Marshall and the moral aplomb of Ida B. Wells.<eos> It was thoroughly impressive and utterly convincing.<eos> And I am happy to say that because Violet, who is right-handed, signed the document with her left hand, the marriage is invalid.<eos> Well, you may not be my wife, but you are still my daughter.<eos> Do you honestly believe I will allow you to continue to care for these three children after the treachery I've seen here tonight?
In a few minutes you'll be meeting your new guardian, Dr. Montgomery.<eos> He's your closest living relative and apparently should've been your guardian all along, according to your deceased parents' will.<eos> I'm beginning to think it was a mistake to listen to that oddly-dressed consultant who walked into my office with no references and no identification, and who suggested that I place you in Count Olaf's care.<eos> My siblings and I wholeheartedly agree.<eos> You're disgrace to your profession.
Don't answer it.<eos> Good morning.<eos> I am Stephano, Dr. Montgomery Montgomery's new assistant.<eos> It's afternoon.<eos> And you're Count Olaf.
It's afternoon.<eos> And you're Count Olaf.<eos> Perhaps one of you can take my suitcases up to my room.<eos> The ride along that smelly road was dull and unpleasant, and Stephano is very tired.<eos> You're Count Olaf, and if anyone ever deserved to travel along Lousy Lane, it's you.
I have been sent from very far away.<eos> Well, that is an unusual and long-winded explanation.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Uh... so let me understand this.<eos> You are my new assistant, sent to me even though I didn't ask for one, by the Scientific Society Seeking to Soothe Stress and Suffering.
Besides...<eos> - Dr. Montgomery.<eos> - Monty!<eos> So sorry.<eos> I seem to have been very careless with the heavy glass reading lamp that was in my bedroom that fell out right when you were walking under it.
It is my job... and my delight, might I add, to keep you safe.<eos> Run along.<eos> Arrive... chechem.<eos> Do you think you can just waltz into my life, and the life of my children, and perpetuate this treachery?<eos> You're a wretched person and a bad actor, Stephano, or whatever your real name is.
Do you think you can just waltz into my life, and the life of my children, and perpetuate this treachery?<eos> You're a wretched person and a bad actor, Stephano, or whatever your real name is.<eos> You don't know my real name?<eos> I don't need to know your real name.<eos> Because you... are a spy from the Herpetological Society.
My, my, my, my, my.<eos> What a terrible accident.<eos> Whoever discovers this will be very upset.<eos> "For in that sleep of death what dreams may come."<eos> You murdered him.
It was clearly the fault of the other driver.<eos> I never...<eos> I thought there were three of you.<eos> Ah, there's the baby.<eos> You're not Dr. Montgomery.
Can't you see, Mr. Poe?<eos> That's Count Olaf.<eos> He's in disguise and he's trying to take us away.<eos> Who am I? What am I doing?<eos> Don't you miss the vivid imagination of childhood?
- Really? - Yes.<eos> And do I look anything like this Count Olaf?<eos> No, you don't.<eos> Count Olaf has one long eyebrow and he has a very short beard.<eos> You have a very long beard, and I hope you don't mind me saying so, no eyebrows at all.
You better go upstairs, children, and pack for your Peruvian adventure.<eos> Mr. Poe, we can't go with Stephano.<eos> We don't have the proper paperwork you mentioned.<eos> She's right.<eos> You do seem like a good person, but the childrens' adventures abroad will have to wait.
He is coughing a lot.<eos> Let's see if he dies of natural causes.<eos> Explain yourself.<eos> The reason that I said I did not know anything about the snakes, is because I was being modest.<eos> You weren't being modest. You haven't been modest a day in your life.
How would Stephano even know about the Baudelaire fortune?<eos> I thought they were penniless orphans.<eos> They certainly dress like penniless orphans.<eos> That's because everything we owned burned up in a fire.<eos> But you already know about that... because you're not Stephano, you're Count Olaf.
We'll see about that.<eos> Your left ankle, sir.<eos> Don't come near me with that thing.<eos> You've been coughing germs into it all day.<eos> Oh, if you're really who the children say you are, then germs are the least of your problem.
Thank you.<eos> So what couldn't wait?<eos> Abe Leonard...<eos> I know you two go way back.<eos> You told him about MacLeish taking out the shooter in Command Ops... Don't deny it.
The story of this conspiracy starts in Afghanistan.<eos> Until we understand that, we don't understand anything.<eos> "And you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free."<eos> John 8:32...<eos> That's what you quoted to MacLeish right before he was shot.
This makes us sound like baby killers.<eos> But you did kill civilians, didn't you?<eos> Women?<eos> Children?<eos> You weren't there!
After his wife died, he said he was retiring from public life.<eos> That's why he never ran for a second term.<eos> Great public servant.<eos> And a consummate politician.<eos> I'm just saying, I wouldn't want him to pull focus from what you're trying to achieve.
And here I was thinking it meant "adulterer."<eos> Well, it intrigues me you never knew the meaning of your last name, considering you picked it.<eos> Is there something I can help you with, Mr. Leonard?<eos> Yeah, I'm curious how the Tribune and the Post both did stories on my "return" to journalism on the exact same day.<eos> You're a Pulitzer winner making a comeback with Teen Mode.
We can't fight right now.<eos> We have to be there for her.<eos> Then don't talk to me.<eos> Well, looks like you have calmed down a bit.<eos> Why don't you tell me who you are?
Kids his age.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Killed my father.<eos> He died nine months later, and then my mother, she moved back to Seoul to live with her sister.<eos> But you stayed.
Oh, she has a horse.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> That's right, sir.<eos> My team is ready.<eos> When you give me the word, I can travel in one hour.
No, thanks.<eos> This a great idea.<eos> Thanks so much for doing this.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You are going to be our first donation of the day.
All the way.<eos> See ya.<eos> Bye, Savanah.<eos> We were walking across the grass, and it was just lying there.<eos> So we picked it up and we brought it in school, and that's when you found us.
Um... just one more thing.<eos> And I hope you don't mind me asking, but there seems to be a misunderstanding between Savanah and her mom and you.<eos> Really?<eos> What kind of misunderstanding?<eos> Savanah believes that you have withheld something from them after the death of her father, lieutenant Stocker.
That's something.<eos> That's something. What do you, uh...<eos> Wh-What do you do, Miss Kimke?<eos> Well, I'm a nursing assistant.<eos> Now, suppose I came down to where you do that... Your hospital...
Sometimes somebody knows they're being followed, the go into a building so they can skip out back.<eos> Leaving whosever tailing them out front thumb up their ass.<eos> Come on, get in the truck. Come on!<eos> And I'm telling you I can't.<eos> I can take him back. You can stay out here.
Everyone's gone now.<eos> I was, uh, doing some consulting--<eos> Whoa. - Sergeant Thom Doyle, retired, IUPA local.<eos> - What the fuck?<eos> And you, sir, are a worthless goddamn punk.
That's Nick Skolka.<eos> He runs this place.<eos> - Hello, Mr. Skolka.<eos> - Welcome to the Death Star.<eos> Nick Skolka. And you are?
Okay.<eos> Franklin hands it to Livingston,<eos> Livingston hands it to Jefferson,<eos> Jefferson gives it to me, and I do this.<eos> ‚ô™ Mr. Sherman, I say you should write it ‚ô™
‚ô™ Mr. Sherman, I say you should write it ‚ô™<eos> ‚ô™ You are never controversial As it were ‚ô™<eos> - ‚ô™ That is true ‚ô™ - ‚ô™ Whereas if I'm the one to do it ‚ô™<eos> ‚ô™ They'll run their quill pens Through it ‚ô™<eos> ‚ô™ I'm obnoxious and disliked You know that, sir ‚ô™
- ‚ô™ That is true ‚ô™ - ‚ô™ Whereas if I'm the one to do it ‚ô™<eos> ‚ô™ They'll run their quill pens Through it ‚ô™<eos> ‚ô™ I'm obnoxious and disliked You know that, sir ‚ô™<eos> ‚ô™ Yes, I do ‚ô™<eos> ‚ô™ Then I say you should write it, Roger ‚ô™
- I can't find him anywhere!<eos> Drink.<eos> Don't blame yourself for this morning.<eos> That mouth-breather Jenkins was trying to make a point instead of doing his job.<eos> Well, aren't you his boss?
Every eye we have is looking for Mr. Emmett Hallstead.<eos> Give me one day, Mr. Bennett, without anything getting in my way, and I will bring him in.<eos> I've already seen what this partnership is capable of together.<eos> I want to see how you operate on your own.<eos> Detective Burke, you will oversee the surveillance operation as we look for Mr. Hallstead.
Either some of us die, or all of us do.<eos> You get the honor of deciding which one of those it's going to be.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Are you with the police?<eos> Who are you?
Don't blame me.<eos> I told you what was gonna happen, and then it happened.<eos> They killed everyone.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You work for them.
More eyebrows.<eos> The other one.<eos> Excuse me? Excuse me.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Hi. Are you the producer?
Pretty cool.<eos> I'll see you at the launch tomorrow.<eos> Yeah!<eos> You know, kid, I gotta admit, you really saved my butt.<eos> Yup. Now you're gonna save mine, right?
Yup.<eos> That's all I wanted.<eos> I'm gonna die!<eos> I'm gonna die.<eos> You've got a good team working for you, Wolf.
I'm sorry.<eos> Welcome to Tycho Station.<eos> All new arrivals must register their ID with station authorities, and will be restricted to the designated areas...<eos> Hey!<eos> You're Praxideke Meng!
You're a very intelligent man.<eos> Oh, hey, thank you.<eos> But you seem to think that everybody else around you is stupid.<eos> Just some.<eos> Just because you can't figure something out doesn't make it magic.
I didn't even know what it was, nobody did.<eos> He wasn't wearing a vac suit...<eos> Sergeant Draper has been through a severe traumatic event.<eos> She needs to rest.<eos> Whoever the fuck you are, stand down and let her speak.
- My plan is to get to the root cause of your excessive violence.<eos> - You mean the newspaper and magazine stories calling me a monster.<eos> - I've read your file.<eos> - And what?<eos> You've read some papers.
I might be a valuable assistance to you when they arrive.<eos> At what price to me?<eos> MI6 would like to extradite Martin Tillman to face criminal charges in Great Britain.<eos> There's no-one of that name here.<eos> You're overlooking a potential opportunity here, Colonel.
You gave Bakewell a bunch of grapes, I believe.<eos> Well, half a bunch.<eos> Felt sorry for him.<eos> On his ownsome, no visitors, you know.<eos> You're a regular patient here, are you?
He didn't do anything!<eos> He's just helping us with our inquiries.<eos> Nurse Bennett.<eos> About your business.<eos> You did this!
- You heard.<eos> A young girl gave evidence to the inquest -- Molly Keenan's cousin, Jo-Beth Keenan.<eos> When she realised her cousin was gravely ill, as a result of the insulin that you gave her, she called the night bell for assistance, only nobody came. Why?<eos> Why didn't you respond, Doctor?<eos> Was it because you and Nurse MacMahon had other more pressing things on your mind?
The latest joint computing nexus model.<eos> Presumably there's a human fail-safe beyond the computer?<eos> Dr Levin, this is Miss Frazil of the Oxford Mail and Detective Constable Morse of the City Police.<eos> I've been giving them a tour of the facility.<eos> Perhaps you could allay their fears.
- This is justice for Matt.<eos> - No, it's not. I was with him the day he went missing.<eos> He went down to the mere to take readings and said he'd pick me up later.<eos> But he never made it back, because these bastards killed him.<eos> And you're protecting them, but we will have justice.
Okay.<eos> - [whirring] - [computer voice] Nice to meet you.<eos> You are unbelievable.<eos> - Do you think it's an organ?<eos> - Do you think it's an organ?
You are unbelievable.<eos> - Do you think it's an organ?<eos> - Do you think it's an organ?<eos> It might be. What do you think it means?<eos> - What do you think it means?
We're doing our job.<eos> You're not helping Burkhardt.<eos> I suggest you take me back now.<eos> We're not taking you back.<eos> You're under arrest.
I don't know when she was murdered.<eos> You didn't seem surprised when we told you.<eos> - I did not kill Rachel Wood.<eos> - But you knew she was dead.<eos> And you were in her apartment.
The woman you were having an affair with threatens to blackmail you, endanger your political ambitions.<eos> So you kill her.<eos> Seems like that'd be pretty easy for a jury to understand.<eos> This will never go to trial, and you know it.<eos> Then if you didn't kill her, who did?
Now what?<eos> Somebody doesn't think you belong here.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Where?<eos> You're looking for Burkhardt.
- And yours.<eos> - Actually, it is a problem.<eos> - Wu...<eos> - This is not right.<eos> I really don't care what you think, Sergeant.
Corrupt cops under Bonaparte's control got greedy.<eos> They went after him.<eos> He went after them.<eos> That's why you resigned the mayorship.<eos> You wanted to lead this investigation.
- He wasn't a man, Paul.<eos> - He wasn't a man!<eos> - Haley, stop it!<eos> - I know what I saw.<eos> - You didn't see this, sir?
Forget this damn blanket and talk to me.<eos> Hey.<eos> Let's tone this down.<eos> I think you guys need to leave our house right now.<eos> No, you need to cool it.
- I'm not crazy.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Haley, Haley...<eos> Listen, you probably don't want to hear this right now, but your wife is not crazy.<eos> Wow, I guess you would know, huh?
It would be an honor to succeed you, sir. You're gonna have to prove your loyalty.<eos> And not just to the mayor's office but to me.<eos> Now, I killed the man in front of you.<eos> I kept my part of the bargain.<eos> If I don't take over this department, you and I are gonna have a problem.
You said it to my face!<eos> Um, no, no.<eos> Look.<eos> I-I was not being myself back then.<eos> You're going to keep your end of the bargain.
Just like you promised.<eos> Now, are you sure you want to be doing this?<eos> You owe me.<eos> I understand you're upset.<eos> I just... you are gonna make me captain of that precinct, or your little girl dies.
God.<eos> No more.<eos> Just... Just let me die.<eos> Hey there, lieutenant.<eos> You and Diana have been having a lot of fun, I see.
It involves the purchase of dead bodies from the Hills Mazy Cemetery.<eos> Wh-what does that have to do with the suspects?<eos> Well, they are our suspects.<eos> Maybe you can explain how their fingerprints ended up at the same crime scene where your colleague was murdered last night, seeing as how they've been dead for six months.<eos> Our very reliable source says you purchased those suspects from the Hills Mazy Cemetery.
If there were no car accident...<eos> The one Shelley was in?<eos> It's how he lost the use of his legs.<eos> And then his son was killed.<eos> What were you and your friends doing with those bodies?
That's better.<eos> He just wants to talk to you.<eos> - About what?<eos> - About what you do.<eos> Did you help Mrs. Cutler die?
I can't do anything to help him.<eos> I mean, how can we explain all this?<eos> We've gotten pretty good at it.<eos> You need to convince Nurse Barton that Mason Wilcox had nothing to do with Mrs. Cutler's death, and you need to testify in court if it goes to trial.<eos> You're her primary physician. People will listen.
Yeah.<eos> Someone he knows thinks Diana might be in danger.<eos> - Who?<eos> - He won't tell me, but it's someone who has the ability to understand these symbols.<eos> Do you know who that might be?
With the dagger.<eos> Wait, let me guess.<eos> It takes a charm or a spell to open it.<eos> No, just a Hexenbiest.<eos> Well, you're the only one we've got.
And what happens if you do get through?<eos> I mean, then what? Now, hopefully, this helps me like it did before.<eos> Wait a minute. Let's...<eos> think about this.<eos> What if you can't find her?
It doesn't make me feel any better.<eos> - Nick!<eos> - What?<eos> Something's happening.<eos> Looks like you're starting to woge.
- Nick!<eos> - What?<eos> Something's happening.<eos> Looks like you're starting to woge.<eos> - Well, I think it's happening whether you want it to or not.
Yeah, how much are we telling him, exactly?<eos> Whatever he wants to know, because we are out of options.<eos> And who's going down in the tunnel with him?<eos> Well, Diana has to go down with me, but I don't wanna be down there alone with Renard.<eos> You won't be.
Also came in handy during Prohibition, I'd imagine.<eos> You might want to watch your step.<eos> After you. Nick, they're human.<eos> They're scared to death of us.<eos> And wouldn't you be, if you were them?
Her skin is turning white. Something is happening.<eos> Nobody knows.<eos> The last people who might've known were slaughtered when the Crusaders sacked Constantinople in the 13th century... 1204, to be exact.<eos> And it's how Nick was able to follow Eve into the... Other place.<eos> Sean, if you or your friend know anything about any of this...
I don't want to be rescued, Nick.<eos> I came here for a reason.<eos> You can't take on the skull thing alone.<eos> You have a son.<eos> You should be thinking of him.
I don't blame you.<eos> When we were together, I only knew a part of who you were.<eos> You only knew a part of who you were. None of us are who we used to be.<eos> And that's good.<eos> You really believe we're all better off?
Zerstoerer.<eos> Decapitare.<eos> He knows you're a Grimm.<eos> He doesn't seem to be too scared of them.<eos> You have any ideas?
Light duty only till the doctor says otherwise.<eos> Anyway, davis could use this cheating business. As a way to push you out of the running. For assistant chief.<eos> Let her.<eos> I'm happy where I am.<eos> You would be good at the job, though, ma'am.
You should look that word up.<eos> "unethical." see what it means.<eos> How 'bout if we give the word "professional" a try?<eos> We're probably on the same side, sir.<eos> We're looking for allie king, and we heard that you were, too.
Two houses in one city.<eos> Well, where do you expect him to summer, julio?<eos> Summer's a verb?<eos> But she never showed.<eos> Were you there when she got ready for dinner?
I highly doubt it.<eos> She's with this super great, super successful rich guy.<eos> Why would she go back to a middle school douchebag. Track coach? Lo dudo.<eos> Trent must have something to offer.<eos> You were really mad when he called the whole thing off.
We'll explain it to you, sir.<eos> Come with me. It's okay.<eos> Bet you wish ndas work two ways.<eos> Do you really think farman did this?<eos> How much do you know about him?
After all the gifts you gave her, After all the trips to paris, hawaii, new york, Even linking your phones so that she could keep tabs.<eos> On your wonderful life, Allie king had the nerve to turn down. Your marriage proposal, didn't she?<eos> We found the $600,000 charge at harry winston's.<eos> Ring like that... burns a hole in your pocket, doesn't it?<eos> You just needed a special place to ask for her hand.
Like a house in the hollywood hills, Dinner at I'etude after.<eos> Yeah, but you missed your 9 p.M. Reservations.<eos> Of course, by then, allie had already been dead for hours.<eos> Her body stiffening in the front trunk of your tesla, Developing indentations in her arm from your hood.<eos> You knew how she was dressed, not clark, And you made the whole thing up about her wearing the blue coat.
Okay? The coat, the coat!<eos> What does that asshole trent have to do with any of this?<eos> Because after seeing you up close,<eos> Allie preferred her ex.<eos> You popped the question, and allie said no.
And I was wondering if..."<eos> "I was wondering if you could forgive him,<eos> "so that he could come home.<eos> "We're having to move him, we're running out of money,<eos> "and we would do whatever you wanted
Yeah.<eos> Now this.<eos> Um, growing up, did you use padlocks on your bedroom doors? No.<eos> The locks went up about a month ago, when Gavin started, like, you know, invading my space.<eos> You and Gavin didn't get along?
It is entirely against company policy. No.<eos> Fine, we'll just pass to the press everything we already know about Gavin's work with AKV.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> No, there has to be some sort of compromise, yes? There is.<eos> You give us the list of all the homes where Gavin was employed, or you expect an avalanche of subpoenas and search warrants that'll disrupt your business for months to come.
Parents are so overprotective of kids these days that hearing their pediatrician was writing a few of her own prescriptions could have ended my whole practice.<eos> So you were lying about selling conflict-free diamonds?<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> Conflict-free diamonds are a myth.<eos> I wanna charge 6 grand, you wanna pay 4.
But you didn't get it back right away, did you?<eos> No, no, no, 'cause Jacobs wanted more money.<eos> And you paid it, didn't you?<eos> Because what is the author of young adult novels to do?<eos> My guess is that you made a detailed arrangement of some kind for a final payment.
Best of luck at trial, Gilman.<eos> I cannot wait for my opening argument.<eos> You don't have a very sympathetic victim.<eos> We thought you might say that.<eos> So since you brought up sympathy, your client should know that there are limits to how well prison guards can protect child molesters.
There must be somebody who's more qualified for this.<eos> You'd think so, wouldn't ya?<eos> Listen, we're saying we need your help and if you want to leave, we can't legally stop you.<eos> Great, then it was nice meeting you.<eos> But out of over 2100 Army therapists, you are the only one who has voluntarily extended your tour three times.
It's not much of a dying wish if I don't die, Director.<eos> So... your wish?<eos> Was it worth it?<eos> Well, for one night, Santa Claus was real.<eos> I'd say that's pretty good, wouldn't you?
Just him, and now you, I guess.<eos> Do you know anyone else that's played the game?<eos> What's going on?<eos> Why don't you come with me, Andrew, and we'll talk about Polybius.<eos> Who are you?
Miss Aguilar, which academy did you go to?<eos> -None. I'm self-taught.<eos> -Self-taught? -Yes.<eos> -[chuckles]<eos> Haven't you ever studied anything on your own?
-[yells]<eos> -Hey!<eos> Stop!<eos> [grunting]<eos> [grunts] Are you all right?
Are you sure you know what you're doing?<eos> [Elisa] Don't be such a wet blanket!<eos> All the fights I had with Father made me wake up and sort myself out.<eos> That's what I'm doing.<eos> You were right. This is my moment.
Just tell me how much it would cost to get the original will back.<eos> Suppose that was the case, and that's supposing a lot... why would you think I kept it?<eos> An intelligent man wouldn't get rid of a valuable document.<eos> You see...<eos> I've been running the company for four years... and Don Ricardo's wish, as you well know, was that I should continue doing so.
Have a seat, Rachel.<eos> What's on your mind?<eos> I wanted to know what you think my chances are of passing the character and fitness portion of the bar.<eos> Why are you coming to me with this?<eos> Because you questioned my integrity once before, and I--I want to know, did you mean it, or were you just helping Anita Gibbs?
What does that say about character and fitness?<eos> You make a good point.<eos> And if I were you,<eos> I'd be prepared with some others, 'cause I'd say one day soon, you're gonna have to make your case.<eos> And do you think I have a better chance of making my case if I work for my father instead of at Pearson Specter Litt?
Parents called the archdiocese to see if it was true, and then--<eos> Don't say it.<eos> I'm sorry, Michael.<eos> I tried to explain the situation to them, but they-- they wouldn't budge.<eos> You have nothing to feel bad about, Father.
Don't say it.<eos> I'm sorry, Michael.<eos> I tried to explain the situation to them, but they-- they wouldn't budge.<eos> You have nothing to feel bad about, Father.<eos> You took a chance.
- Yes, you can.<eos> My name's Mike Ross.<eos> I'm here on behalf of Sofia Price, and this is every dime of rent she owes your client.<eos> And why exactly are you bringing that to me?<eos> Because you're an attorney, not a landlord, and I don't want there to be any misunderstandings.
Donna Paulsen, I wasn't gonna ask you this for another few weeks, but how would you feel about pursuing this with me as a business opportunity?<eos> Let me think about it.<eos> But first, let me borrow that thing for a few days.<eos> Wanna tell me why you're playing games with my associate's admission to the Bar?<eos> - You're Harvey Specter.
Reckless endangerment?<eos> Is this a joke?<eos> I guarantee you, Sofia Price isn't laughing.<eos> Well, any judge in his right mind is gonna laugh you out of court, because you don't understand the law.<eos> No, you're the one that doesn't understand the law,
You started demolition with tenants still in your building.<eos> You sent a three-year-old to the emergency room.<eos> You pursue this, I'm going straight after the mother, and I'll turn her into the negligent party, and she'll be lucky to keep her son.<eos> You do that, and I'll show the court that you filed construction plans with the city, claiming that the building was empty, which is punishable under the criminal code.<eos> No, Mr. Ross, you won't show them anything.
And you're married, and your wife can't find out about it, and that's why you can't go to the FBI.<eos> There, now you know.<eos> What I know is Rachel Zane deserves to be in the Bar, so you're not only gonna stop blocking her, you're gonna run interference for her if someone else does.<eos> I don't have the power to do that. You had the power to stop it, and you better believe that you can turn it the other direction.<eos> And in return, you'll do what I want.
This case is based entirely on speculation, and it should be dismissed.<eos> This case is based on the fact that your client started construction while tenants were still in the building, in violation of the Real Estate Code.<eos> And what if I told you Ms. Price signed off this?<eos> I'd say that's not possible, because she didn't.<eos> Well, you've got documents, and I have one too.
Your name is William, but everybody calls you Billy?<eos> - You remember?<eos> - I do remember, yes.<eos> Hey, this is my family, this is Laura, my wife.<eos> - How do you do?
But...<eos> Winnie Davis is watching you - as closely as she is me. - ‚Ä≠Mm-hmm.<eos> And I can't afford for the more classified element of this case to throw you off track.<eos> You want me to be Assistant Chief?<eos> Commander, you are very much in the running yourself.
Again, that wasn't me.<eos> Pay phones?<eos> Aren't pay phones a thing of the past?<eos> All due respect, my son is misremembering the night.<eos> And Danny handing you his cell and you walking around the outside of the Harbor Grill pretending to try to make a phone call... is your son misremembering all that, too?
You used it to look at an app you installed on your son's phone years ago... OffKey.<eos> And you found the new user name and password to unlock the door of your old house.<eos> Look, you have this all wrong.<eos> Okay, then help us understand.<eos> You made a call last night from the Harbor Grill to someone at a pay phone about a mile and a half at your ex-wife's house.
But the moment it is complete, I will personally walk it over here to Ms. Rothman myself.<eos> So meanwhile, I'm left completely in the dark?<eos> Your Honor, we're only asking for 24 hours.<eos> The description of this new evidence is entirely too vague.<eos> You just wasted a day over nothing, Ms. Rothman.
And we were wondering if you could account for your time the night your ex sister-in-law's husband was shot to death.<eos> We called the restaurant where you popped the champagne.<eos> No sommelier on a weekend night.<eos> I mean, Sunday evening is vintage drinking time.<eos> You were at a pay phone waiting for your brother to call from Catalina.
Excuse me, everyone.<eos> Great job, by the way.<eos> Really impressive.<eos> Mike, I'm sure you can handle this as well as me.<eos> Not as fast as you can, Commander.
Then we'll run your cell to Chandler's house, see if it sets off an alert.<eos> While Commander Mason works with your phone, let's examine your choices.<eos> While you still have them, because if we trace back all the information on your OffKey app before you cooperate...<eos> Your brother could be found not guilty, and we would have no choice but to try you for Murder in the First.<eos> And then you'll have to hear all about how your vines are maturing while you're sitting on Death Row.
Many, many people live their whole lives with grapes in their brains, and never even know it.<eos> But now I do.<eos> We'll do a biopsy, of course.<eos> - Just try not to worry.<eos> - Because you're not worried.
We make it look cool, like totally awesome.<eos> Yeah.<eos> This is it.<eos> Which one of you Bruce Lees ruined my door?<eos> - Oh, you own this place?
It doesn't work that way.<eos> You know what you need to do.<eos> I don't want to break up with him.<eos> Then forgive him?<eos> I'd rather you slap me.
You really think we could do that?<eos> We can try.<eos> Rachel Zane deserves to be in the Bar.<eos> You're not only gonna stop blocking her, you're gonna run interference for her if someone else does.<eos> And in return, you'll do what I want.
That's okay.<eos> I'm not here for a cheeseburger.<eos> I'm here to talk about Hazelton Mining Company.<eos> - What about it?<eos> - You filed a complaint alleging life-threatening health problems resulting from work.
That's got nothing to do with it.<eos> They made us all sign those things.<eos> If any one of us breaks it, it negates them all.<eos> Then negate them all.<eos> That's easy for you to say.
If any one of us breaks it, it negates them all.<eos> Then negate them all.<eos> That's easy for you to say.<eos> I'm dying of something with a name so long, I can't even tell you what it is.<eos> And you're talking about your fee being capped at more money than they paid me.
In other words, awesome.<eos> Yes, that's the entire point of this exercise.<eos> And for the record, no one awesome listens to Enya.<eos> Well maybe not her later work.<eos> You're the whole team?
No.<eos> Look, losing a good friend is not the right way to get a clerkship.<eos> Poor Indra.<eos> And his parents, it's like a nightmare.<eos> But you'll still take the gig.
Look, losing a good friend is not the right way to get a clerkship.<eos> Poor Indra.<eos> And his parents, it's like a nightmare.<eos> But you'll still take the gig.<eos> You were runner-up.
I can't tell you how deeply saddened I was to hear about this.<eos> William Sax was an extraordinary young man.<eos> If you came to me 30 years from now and asked about Will Sax, Supreme Court Justice,<eos> I would not bat an eye.<eos> What do you know about his friends?
M-a-l-i-k.<eos> Malik Jacob Lewis.<eos> He was, uh, just 16 1/2 years old.<eos> I'm curious.<eos> Lots of people have accidents and keep their name, but you found it necessary to change yours. Why?
I'm not going to ask you because I already know why you ran Will Sax down.<eos> We all understand.<eos> What I can't figure out is how you were able to locate him.<eos> Mrs. Harris, we're seriously good detectives, but we didn't find out that Malik Lewis and his whole family had changed their names until his mom and dad told us.<eos> But somehow, some way, you were able to find him.
Captain, you have a second?<eos> Uh, one, Lieutenant.<eos> Is there a problem?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> The case looks good, as do you, by the way.
Emt climbed up halfway up, Determined him dead from...<eos> Well, the smell.<eos> Yeah, and kendall is unwilling to begin his examination.<eos> He's over 40 feet high.<eos> You try getting up there.
In explaining my job to my father over the years, I may have exaggerated just how closely I work with major crimes.<eos> Exaggerated how?<eos> How do you feel about working for me this week?<eos> Look, my father had five sons, And I'm the only one that didn't become a police officer.<eos> All I want is to assist in the case, And for you to occasionally make it... Look like I'm in charge.
Captain, why is your lieutenant. Asking for exclusive access to...<eos> Dr. Morales?<eos> Chief davis, dr. Morales is very busy.<eos> Maybe we could take this outside?<eos> Chief, I would prefer it if you called. Before interrupting an active murder investigation.
They're covered in chocolate fingerprints.<eos> Check out your hands.<eos> Yes, do give me a second.<eos> I can explain you?<eos> It's very important for you to know. We're not asking you to explain anything.
You went on a trip to arizona, you had an accident.<eos> You're obviously not criminals, just some guys. Who got caught up with a dangerous drug lord.<eos> Are we wrong?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> It was like you said.
And while we were trying to land...<eos> Well, a giant bale of pot just... It flew right out.<eos> I'm lucky it didn't take me with it.<eos> Yeah, and felix, h-he couldn't hold on.<eos> You know... He had a bit of a weight problem.
And us in it!<eos> Us!<eos> You are very lucky, both of you.<eos> Now if you could just write all this down?<eos> By signing here, you grant temporary guardianship. Of mark jarvis to julio sanchez. Until an official transfer can be performed.
Yeah.<eos> You know, your son, eduardo, Is always tough in these situations.<eos> Insignia for a well-known brand of shoe.<eos> This shoe... A size 10, rubber-sole, treaded-heel boot. Belonging to you, mr.<eos> Your friend felix held on for dear life, All 250 pounds of him, Flapping in the air as you stamped.
A thousand dollars.<eos> A thousand dollars. Cheap fool.<eos> Pay up, sucker.<eos> A chance right there on Oriental Avenue.<eos> Pat wants a word if you're free.
Let me guess: you wanna see my papers.<eos> I was born here, dude. 135th Street.<eos> Nah, we're NYPD.<eos> We don't care about that.<eos> So, you own this place?
Yusef is stubborn.<eos> He wanted cigarettes.<eos> But he needs to testify.<eos> He's our most important witness.<eos> You said that the D.A. was getting a warrant.
You let it happen.<eos> You let those girls get raped.<eos> You let Shala and Kanann die.<eos> - They had...<eos> - You did that.
That's why they wanted to hurt him.<eos> That's why everyone hates us.<eos> No, they hate Hector because he was there.<eos> He was in the restaurant the night of the attack.<eos> Says you.
My children are U.S. citizens.<eos> I have their birth certificates to prove it.<eos> And I realize that.<eos> They're safe.<eos> But you're undocumented, Soledad.
- So what?<eos> - So what?<eos> What else you do?<eos> You smoke a little meth?<eos> One of the women that you assaulted, she remembers smelling tequila on your breath.
I'm taking particular interest in you.<eos> So have at it.<eos> You were drinking tequila, you were smoking meth. What else?<eos> You're putting words in my mouth.<eos> Okay, well, one of the women that you and your buddy raped, she survived.
- Come on, Carleen.<eos> You really expect us to believe that?<eos> You don't think that we're gonna find evidence that shows that that's a lie?<eos> Mitch's phone, his footprints, his DNA.<eos> If you lie in court to help Mitch and he goes down for murder, you go away for perjury.
If you lie in court to help Mitch and he goes down for murder, you go away for perjury.<eos> Who is gonna be there to take care of your boy?<eos> I'm not lying. And you leave my boy out of this!<eos> I am trying to help your son.<eos> I also know you and Mitch have your problems.
That is why I decided to tell the truth.<eos> Nothing further.<eos> I can only imagine how hard this must be for you and your daughter.<eos> And how confusing it must be.<eos> The morning after the incident, you told Lieutenant Benson, quote, you "didn't see" "any of their faces.
Yes.<eos> So they were wearing masks the whole time until Hector Ramirez was shot and killed.<eos> Then suddenly, they weren't wearing masks the whole time.<eos> - No. That is not true.<eos> - You knew the prosecution's case was weak.
I'm so sorry, Maya.<eos> You said that you care.<eos> - You don't even care.<eos> - That's not true.<eos> I give you a chance right there, right now, and you didn't take it.
- Watching TV.<eos> - Who were you with?<eos> - My son. - Was your husband with you that evening?<eos> No.<eos> When you spoke to the police after your husband was arrested, you stated that you and your husband were home the entire evening.
My name is "I'm black and I'm proud."<eos> What's your name?<eos> Okay, my name is Officer Kim Burgess, and this is a crime scene, so if you know something and you can help us in some way...<eos> Help you?<eos> They are killing our daughters, and you're asking me for my help?
- You gonna shoot me?<eos> - Ma'am, you need to calm down.<eos> Do you hear me?<eos> Holster your Tazer!<eos> And you, walk away.
My sister can't hardly leave the house.<eos> She's beautiful.<eos> She was... the best thing that's happened to this family, and I intend to get her justice.<eos> And that's why we're here.<eos> You said "They're killing our daughters."
I'm back in.<eos> Let's do the thing.<eos> It seems like the more condos they build, the busier I get.<eos> You know what I mean?<eos> So, you're the superior officer, right?
'Let me bathe in the lake.'<eos> Sire!<eos> Sire, please, go no further.<eos> A bad dream, Your Majesty, that is all. Smelling salts will help.<eos> You were sleepwalking, Sire.
Breathe the fresh air while you can.<eos> With the King in Paris for the night, we shall focus only on the preparation of an agenda to present to His Majesty tomorrow on his return.<eos> Louvois, what is the status of the prisoner?<eos> Alive, unrepentant, awaiting His Majesty's decision.<eos> What say you, Monsieur de Reynaud?
How would you keep warm at night?<eos> It's called a blanket - green and full of feathers... a bit like you.<eos> The King's here.<eos> Don't look at him!<eos> Have you seen this coat?
No drop of ink shall mark your time.<eos> No image nor crest nor lock of hair.<eos> Your worldly goods, your clothes, all burned.<eos> Your lineage disowned, cast out, forgotten.<eos> You will be to history what you are to me at this moment... ..nothing.
In the forest, collecting herbs.<eos> Minister Reynaud died one hour ago - long, great pain, a swift decline.<eos> Our Princess Henriette was the same.<eos> Identical.<eos> And you need me to examine the body?
Our Princess Henriette was the same.<eos> Identical.<eos> And you need me to examine the body?<eos> I do, but burn it afterwards.<eos> You must take every precaution.
And three heads is better than two, in this case.<eos> That depends on the heads, of course.<eos> Your Majesties.<eos> I'm sure I don't understand.<eos> You are no doubt both aware that my brother requires a new wife.
It's a useful social tool.<eos> It involves hitting things, so I'm sure you'd enjoy it immensely.<eos> Our Court Etiquette is quite clear on the subject. Yes, yes.<eos> I know the King's social handbook favours the pinkie.<eos> Useless method if you ask me.
The next few days are auspicious, Madame de Foix.<eos> An eclipse in the light tells of great change.<eos> - Do go on. - Of course.<eos> Excuse me a moment, Mother.<eos> I see you are wearing last week's cuffs, Cassel.
The King has given him a position.<eos> He left this morning.<eos> Really?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> You will detail the life of His Majesty's court here at Versailles.
I shall hear my fortune.<eos> - Sire, I believe...<eos> Bontemps, I nearly forgot!<eos> I took a bath yesterday and the olive soap was nowhere to be seen.<eos> Would you be an absolute dear and order me some more from Paris?
My ladies just don't seem capable.<eos> Give her what she wants.<eos> My dear!<eos> Madame Agathe!<eos> You mentioned an extremely important consultation... but I did not dare dream it would be here.
You mentioned an extremely important consultation... but I did not dare dream it would be here.<eos> Now, I hope you understand how vital it is that he be inspired by his time with you.<eos> I brought only the best for you, my dear.<eos> In the time of an eclipse, a deck of great power and prophecy.<eos> You'll speak only of the glories you see, nothing more.
Just the light.<eos> Yes.<eos> But even in the light, it is our shadows that speak the truth.<eos> The glory.<eos> The glory, as you say.
I cannot lie to my king.<eos> I see no glory.<eos> Thank you for all the fun!<eos> We are leaving.<eos> You have seen Paradise.
I see no glory.<eos> Thank you for all the fun!<eos> We are leaving.<eos> You have seen Paradise.<eos> And you have built it for yourself.
De Busseys?<eos> Is no-one coming?<eos> Where is everyone?<eos> Versailles.<eos> You're not everyone.
You're not everyone.<eos> It's time for you to come home.<eos> I am home.<eos> This is my home.<eos> You are sitting in my home.
That would be pain everlasting.<eos> That would be Hell.<eos> May you live long in hellfire.<eos> The King's favour is no longer upon you.<eos> You are no longer worthy to gaze upon his glory.
You are the apple of my eye but stop taking me for granted.<eos> In two words: total humiliation.<eos> He showed no interest in me whatsoever.<eos> He said he found me unappealing to the eye and he preferred men. How awful for you!<eos> What will you do?
Inform my brother that he will hunt with me.<eos> My dear fellow, you seem lost. Is it the smoke?<eos> No, I'm not lost.<eos> Not lost and not welcome. The door is behind you.<eos> And if you see your mother, do thank her for the gift.
You were involved in a plot against him.<eos> Bold accusations need strong evidence.<eos> Believe me, I have enough evidence to have you sent to the gallows.<eos> We've, all of us, made errors. We're made to regret it.<eos> You made an error.
The Palace will not be cleansed so easily.<eos> Confession is one thing. Discovering the path of purity is another.<eos> We cannot prevail without the King's support.<eos> If he chooses to remain in sin, most of the court will remain with him.<eos> You'll lead him to it.
Is that all?<eos> You think you can destroy the bond between the King and me but we are stronger than any of your sermons.<eos> You are a sinner, driven only by the desires of the flesh.<eos> Oh, am I alone in that?<eos> I've seen you with the Queen.
Sniper's headed up.<eos> Take it from red team.<eos> The Archbishop's plane is still in the air.<eos> We're trying to reach him.<eos> You're not listening to me, Eric.
Concessionism, no.<eos> How about you offer to take that math course this summer?<eos> Might as well gouge my eyes out.<eos> Make the concession.<eos> Tell her that you'll do the course.
Who are you, by the way?<eos> I come unarmed.<eos> Just like Jesus into the temple.<eos> Trudy prayed with these people, Bernard.<eos> You don't want to hurt them.
I come unarmed.<eos> Just like Jesus into the temple.<eos> Trudy prayed with these people, Bernard.<eos> You don't want to hurt them.<eos> I don't think you want to hurt anybody.
Just like Jesus into the temple.<eos> Trudy prayed with these people, Bernard.<eos> You don't want to hurt them.<eos> I don't think you want to hurt anybody.<eos> You just... you just want to save your wife.
Six...<eos> You want god to help you need to get on your knees...<eos> You,<eos> Five...<eos> And show him that you believe.
I'm just gonna set up in there, if that okay.<eos> So, how does this work?<eos> Eric does the negotiating.<eos> I deal with law enforcement and handle security assessments.<eos> So, you're, what, a cop?
An aggressive move to impose a view on the adverse party.<eos> Normally used in situations.<eos> Where the negotiator has the upper hand.<eos> We have the upper hand?<eos> You will when he calls back.
Help!<eos> Help me!<eos> Professional negotiator... Never heard that one before.<eos> Well, most people haven't until they need one.<eos> You're an expensive option.
Professional negotiator... Never heard that one before.<eos> Well, most people haven't until they need one.<eos> You're an expensive option.<eos> I won't ask more than you can afford.<eos> And if I don't get your son back, you don't pay.
I didn't see much point in fixing it.<eos> Listen, Mr. Beaumont... Eric.<eos> I don't mean to be rude,<eos> But you've got to understand, if that...<eos> You lost your son once.
Listen, Mr. Beaumont... Eric.<eos> I don't mean to be rude,<eos> But you've got to understand, if that...<eos> You lost your son once.<eos> I don't imagine you want to go through that again.
Because my brother, he have no tongue.<eos> Our father...<eos> He cut it out.<eos> I want to call my mom and dad.<eos> Why for you do that?
Other than your impressive GPA, that is.<eos> I...<eos> Always wanted to do this.<eos> So you said.<eos> You didn't say why.
Were you a solid hire when Eric found you?<eos> Was I?<eos> Your loyalty... Is pathological.<eos> Do not shrink me, Oliver.<eos> You're the one who's obsessing.
It'll shoot harder.<eos> Good, good, good.<eos> Re vlakas.<eos> I say to throw away!<eos> You know what they will do to us?
No, no police.<eos> Beth. No!<eos> They said they'd kill him.<eos> Now, you make that call, and I will never forgive you.<eos> You need to tell your wife, Mr. Miller.
I lost our son... And then I lost the money.<eos> If I lose you, too...<eos> You want to tell me something?<eos> I know you talked to the boy.<eos> You pay or we kill him.
Tell her how moved you were when you read it.<eos> Ay...<eos> Hola.<eos> Come on.<eos> You were in tears.
Samuel is Marked as absent today.<eos> That's a shame.<eos> We came all this way.<eos> Okay, thank you.<eos> You wouldn't happen to have his home address, would you?
I say what I have to say.<eos> Yeah, me too.<eos> Look...<eos> Once this is all over,<eos> You know I have to tell him who you are, right?
But I would strongly advise against that.<eos> Why?<eos> So they don't kill the boy.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> You pay a kidnapper, he releases the victim.
What's that sound you hear?<eos> I don't hear anything.<eos> Exactly, I haven't called the police,<eos> Who would be all over you by now.<eos> $700,000 and you and your brother walk away.
We got company.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Eric.<eos> Give him the money.<eos> As soon as you give us the boy.
You're gonna be all right, pal.<eos> Now you give him the money.<eos> Phone's going in the pocket.<eos> You like the boy, don't you?<eos> You played that soccer game with him.
Now you give him the money.<eos> Phone's going in the pocket.<eos> You like the boy, don't you?<eos> You played that soccer game with him.<eos> That's why you and your brother were fighting.
Phone's going in the pocket.<eos> You like the boy, don't you?<eos> You played that soccer game with him.<eos> That's why you and your brother were fighting.<eos> You don't want him to get hurt like he hurt you.
Go ahead.<eos> Take a look inside.<eos> It's all there.<eos> $700,000 just as we promised.<eos> Now, you can walk away,
Time to tell him.<eos> Mr. Beaumont.<eos> Something I should've said up front.<eos> The reason Oliver... Rejected my application...<eos> I know who you are, Ms. Carlson.
Well, Oliver may be right.<eos> He usually is.<eos> Usually?<eos> I'm confused.<eos> Why would you hire me if you knew who my mother was?
If there's a bad outcome,<eos> Does this thing become an international incident?<eos> We have consent from all parties.<eos> The state department's been apprised.<eos> You know, there is a potential upside to this, As long as you pull it off, So, all right.
Thank you.<eos> Hi.<eos> I'm dr. Wheeler.<eos> Do you know where you are?<eos> Do you understand?
No.<eos> I'll help you.<eos> Here. Introduce yourself to the son.<eos> I'm dr.<eos> Reese. I understand you're the patient's son.
Guess we should've, dr.<eos> I don't think that's very funny.<eos> A word, doctor?<eos> Can you explain what that was about?<eos> They didn't call you. Because they don't think you're very good. With emotionally distraught people.
Thanks.<eos> All right.<eos> Keep your fingers crossed.<eos> Dr. Charles.<eos> I looked online at the therapies that you mentioned.
That's the thing about the e.D.<eos> Another story's just a heartbeat away.<eos> Can you say that again on camera?<eos> Yes, that'll be better.<eos> Ms. Goodwin, if you have a second... You know, dr.
I was thinking a woven graft with a mechanical valve.<eos> And once we adjust for the inversa, It should be a simple plug and play.<eos> Simple? Yeah, I was saying to dr.<eos> Bardovi earlier, Once you situate your brain in the right way...<eos> You were talking to dr. Bardovi. About the way I situate my brain?
What's up with the limp? Rehab.<eos> My physio's got me doing these swiss ball squats.<eos> It's freaking brutal.<eos> Cbc's back on your sinus infection.<eos> You were right.
Wait a second, will you?<eos> We gotta swap out a battery.<eos> Sure thing.<eos> Dr. Halstead?<eos> You wouldn't be trying to show me up on camera, would you?
What we're talking about here...<eos> Is this the kind of thing that could keep me in the hospital?<eos> I would plan on that, yes.<eos> Should I plan on ever leaving?<eos> If it's advanced enough to require surgery, Then you should know there's about a 90% mortality rate.
Thank you, both.<eos> State's attorneys secured the warrant.<eos> We're a go.<eos> I don't believe that story rey's telling about the gun,<eos> Do you?
Why not?<eos> You shouldn't do anything risky, Let alone perform open-heart surgery.<eos> It would be derelict.<eos> Tell me, then, What is the solution?<eos> Well, the solution is to realize. That you don't have to carry all the weight. On your shoulders.
I see the world differently now.<eos> The sarcasm, the hidden agendas.<eos> Even when my window is closed, I know they're there.<eos> I have no one to rely on now but myself.<eos> I think you'll find that that's not the case.
I have to get this.<eos> Yeah?<eos> I cannot believe this woman.<eos> How's that old saying go?<eos> You can lead a horse to water, But you can't make it gaze at its own reflection.
Asperger's.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm not revealing this to elicit sympathy from you,<eos> Or as a means to justify my behavior.<eos> I simply feel it might be beneficial for you to know.
I'm not revealing this to elicit sympathy from you,<eos> Or as a means to justify my behavior.<eos> I simply feel it might be beneficial for you to know.<eos> I think it might be.<eos> I am unable to discern whether you're being sarcastic or not.
Why?<eos> Because it's the right thing to do.<eos> Thank you, ms. Goodwin.<eos> Dr. Halstead.<eos> You convinced him to sign the release, Yet you led me to believe you objected to all of this.
His oncologist ordered straight through the hospital.<eos> No other way to get it.<eos> He's just waiting for his son to die?<eos> Mr. Moore.<eos> We are aware that your son was prescribed a new oral chemo, and that you have been withholding it.
He's just waiting for his son to die?<eos> Mr. Moore.<eos> We are aware that your son was prescribed a new oral chemo, and that you have been withholding it.<eos> I'm not "withholding" them.<eos> I understand that you're a single father and that this must be incredibly hard for you...
Which is why we decided that you, Grace, wouldn't see her anymore. Right?<eos> Right.<eos> They're ready for Mrs. Scott in CT.<eos> Okay, well, very nice to meet you, Grace.<eos> Um, we hope that both you and Becca are feeling better soon.
I'm just saying, things were different.<eos> Like, guys didn't need to tell women every single thing they were feeling.<eos> My father never did.<eos> Are we still talking about diabetes?<eos> Brought the rest of that assessment for you to fill out.
Correct, Dr. Bardovi.<eos> This patient is stable. Close his incision.<eos> Why?<eos> We are expecting an influx of trauma patients.<eos> Per emergency protocol, you and I will be in charge of triage.
Cut the crap, all right? Blah, blah, blah.<eos> - I'm out of my meds.<eos> - Did you call your doctor?<eos> He's out. Why else would I be here?<eos> How hard is it for you to write me a prescription?
A patient attacked a nurse. They need you.<eos> Mr. Kellogg, I'm very sorry.<eos> We are gonna take excellent care of you, but you're gonna have to wait a little bit longer.<eos> - For God's sake.<eos> - I will be right back, and I'm gonna make you one of our first priorities.
Worst case, Josh loses a leg, but there is no question he has the best chance of survival.<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> - We're very sorry, but it's up to you to decide which of the boys gets the blood.<eos> Decide who gets the blood?<eos> The doctors have their opinion, but it is a decision you and your husband should make, and he's still in surgery.
What... what about Benny?<eos> We are doing everything that we can,<eos> - but he needs blood.<eos> - Okay, I'll donate.<eos> I'm sorry, sir, but neither you nor your wife are a match.
But given the fact that you've already had a cardiac event, it is my recommendation that we do a coronary artery bypass graft.<eos> This is pretty major surgery, right?<eos> It is, but you are an excellent candidate.<eos> So I'd like to give your heart a day to rest, and then we can get you on the schedule for tomorrow.<eos> If you say so, let's do it.
Are you giving up?<eos> No.<eos> But Ms. Goodwin is right.<eos> We can try peritoneal lavage to speed things up.<eos> You are his doctor.
Okay.<eos> Lungs are wet.<eos> Does this hurt, Dr. Rowan?<eos> Okay, all right, all right.<eos> Who are you?
And I'm fine.<eos> I've answered your question.<eos> I know what today is.<eos> I know where I am.<eos> Aside from lack of energy, your co-pilot says that at times you seem mildly confused.
- Dr. Halstead... there's a Mr. Sherwood here from the nursing home.<eos> He wants to know how Dr. Rowan is doing.<eos> I'll be happy to tell him.<eos> Sherwood, is it?<eos> You mind telling me how you and your staff let a textbook case of aspiration pneumonia go unattended?
Your staff knew she had trouble swallowing.<eos> Okay, I-I promise you I'll look into this.<eos> - I'm sure you will.<eos> - You better.<eos> I mean, that she... that Dr. Rowan should come to this, all because you denied her the most basic... hey!
That may not be true.<eos> I-I emphatically recommend that you take Dr. Choi's advice.<eos> As far as the psych evaluation goes, am I in the clear?<eos> Well, not listening to your physician isn't the greatest sign to me.<eos> Well, you're not the only psychiatrist in Chicago.
- And you... hey!<eos> ... with the hair.<eos> Get me a coffee.<eos> And don't forget the French vanilla creamer this time.<eos> Agent May, with the possible exception of my mother, you are the single most intimidating woman I have ever met.
Unless they use explosives.<eos> Still don't feel like telling us what's inside?<eos> Then I guess we're doing this.<eos> Mack and I can go around, ICE the three on the far side.<eos> Director, you take out the two by the case.
Personally, I can overlook your sins.<eos> But my comrades... well, let's just say they are less forgiving than I am.<eos> Communications room at sub-basement ... Fitz-Simmons.<eos> - On it.<eos> - Davis, you're with them.
Well, that's simply not accurate.<eos> A defining human trait seems to be regret, or so I've observed.<eos> You even asked me to repair one regret for each person entering the Framework.<eos> Yes.<eos> Well, you, Doctor, exhibit poor self-control, and if you someday come to regret building the Framework, you could change my parameters and have me dismantle it.
It's...<eos> Oh, there's no sane way to say it, so...<eos> Do you have moments where reality isn't quite right?<eos> Like y-your memories don't fit?<eos> - Who are you?
Okay.<eos> It's time to leave.<eos> No, please, you... you need to hear this.<eos> I am an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.<eos> You were the Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.
It's time to leave.<eos> No, please, you... you need to hear this.<eos> I am an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.<eos> You were the Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.<eos> You destroyed Hydra.
No, please, you... you need to hear this.<eos> I am an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.<eos> You were the Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.<eos> You destroyed Hydra.<eos> And now you're... you're... you're trapped in a virtual prison, and I am here to wake you up.
Is this a test?<eos> Because it's not gonna work.<eos> I'm loyal to Hydra.<eos> I'm just a teacher.<eos> Yes, you are a teacher!
Why did you say that?<eos> It's a magical place.<eos> This isn't an accident.<eos> Your memory's been rewritten before!<eos> You are Phil Coulson, agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., and your subconscious knows that!
Well, Anderson's gonna pay off our debt to Ricky and Vernon. That's it.<eos> Oh, you better close this Wayne motherfucker.<eos> - Hi. - Was Jack Moore fired?<eos> I'm sorry, one question at a time, please. Sorry.<eos> Wh-who are you?
Goddamn it.<eos> I got it.<eos> Phineas.<eos> Fred.<eos> And you must be Colonel McCullough.
A sweet, untouched hanging risk?<eos> Why would I need that kind of peril?<eos> The peril is the adventure, surely.<eos> You mistake me for a gull.<eos> I have told my new friends that you are unsurpassed.
Well, here are some of her promissory notes.<eos> Pay them.<eos> There's more than fifty pounds here!<eos> Yes, she's a very poor gambler.<eos> My lord, the chosen few... may not be as exclusive as you think.
Mr. Lennox has often spoken of you.<eos> Really?<eos> Harriet knows all about us.<eos> I never thought I'd see you again.<eos> You are in trade, Mrs. Wells, are you not?
I have a boy just like.<eos> Tomorrow I want you to meet my eldest son.<eos> He's a bit...<eos> I think your house might suit him.<eos> You're welcome too, Mrs. Lennox.
Between them, they own Berkshire.<eos> My mother delights in little secrets, so find out whatever you can.<eos> I say.<eos> It's French.<eos> And where are you from, Missy?
I feel villainous.<eos> And I deserve every bit of your righteous passion.<eos> Yes!<eos> Mr. Quiggy!<eos> You're my man!
God has made me a vessel for truth, and I must speak it.<eos> You live in my property rent-free!<eos> I am your God now, Mrs. Scanwell, and you will speak your truth for me!<eos> I have taken your house for the sake of my daughter... and I will do your bidding... but you will always hear God's truth from me.<eos> You're a scorpion, Mrs. Scanwell;
This is a trifling matter, madam.<eos> Take your scandal sheet and go.<eos> Forgive me.<eos> I do not have the superior force of male reason willing my actions.<eos> As you and your powerful friends do.
No more county balls for poor Miss Pettifer.<eos> Only hairy ones now.<eos> I hope he strangles you next time.<eos> I used to get Osborne.<eos> Then you came.
That day is soon upon us, my brothers, when London... That's the youngest daughter.<eos> Margaret Wells has debauched her own child!<eos> That girl is cursed to have such a mother!<eos> What about your poor child?<eos> Margaret Wells, you are treacherous to the innocent.
You're the bad bawd of London, Ma.<eos> When I've striven so hard to be so good.<eos> I'll do your pimping at The Cocoa Tree tonight.<eos> Take Lucy with you.<eos> See if you can help her.
Did you hear what I said?<eos> I won't allow it.<eos> Very well.<eos> When Mr. Osborne arrives, you tell him so.<eos> But keep him happy, even if you have to service him yourself.
Will you come?<eos> Yes.<eos> You must wear a mask.<eos> I will.<eos> You must take yours off. I will.
Leave.<eos> I haven't finished playing.<eos> Well, I'm ordering you back to the house.<eos> - You're making yourself foolish.<eos> - No, you have done that.
- You're making yourself foolish.<eos> - No, you have done that.<eos> Go back to the house or I'll take you there myself.<eos> My sister's still inside.<eos> But you cannot go back in.
Oh, dear.<eos> Spurned for another.<eos> How will I ease my poor heart?<eos> I didn't know you had such an organ in your body.<eos> I swear you're missing an organ, too, Haxby.
Thank you, madam.<eos> Do I detect a small voice of conscience whispering in your ear?<eos> You going to try and save my soul?<eos> This is such a sinful world.<eos> Perhaps you're the one who needs saving.
I'd pour gold into your lap if I was sure of your love.<eos> You have it.<eos> I love you.<eos> I told you not to lie.<eos> So, you are the ferryman who must be paid.
I am Hades, king of the underworld.<eos> And here's my queen.<eos> Tonight will be what we make it.<eos> Well, what you make it.<eos> 'Cause you're Margaret Wells, queen of bloody Soho.
You're a powerful man.<eos> I bet you always get what you want.<eos> Oh, I do.<eos> But tonight,<eos> I'm your queen, and you're my subject.
I'll hide you upstairs.<eos> Go on.<eos> Well, I always knew you were a whore.<eos> For the first time in my life, I am paid.<eos> Well, aren't you full of surprises?
Your brain always in your breeches, too swollen to think.<eos> That's hardly fair.<eos> I should've had a girl.<eos> No daughter of mine would've allowed herself to be duped by a whore.<eos> Why were you the one I chose to keep?
Very well.<eos> We'll talk to him.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Charlotte Wells.<eos> You are a forward, flaunting hussy.
Be mine.<eos> Should we retire to your apartment to discuss terms?<eos> Wife's in town, one of her dinners.<eos> But this is perfect.<eos> I can be the farmer, you the milkmaid... panting for congress in the open air.
You must be good, Bets, he's having a spasm every time you touch him.<eos> I gave you all my money.<eos> Aww, poor Bobby.<eos> I'm toying with a conundrum, lady:<eos> whether to tell your harlot you're in the pay of Madame Quigley, or to tell your mother you're in the sway of a harlot.
Howard.<eos> Rescue me from your tedious man.<eos> He does babble so.<eos> Haxby, you will leave this house and my family's employ at this minute.<eos> Sir, you know me well enough to know I...
Do you not fear for her?<eos> Such a pretty thing out all alone on these dangerous streets.<eos> Of course I fear for her.<eos> I hear of abominable things happening to girls just like her.<eos> Even you would not be so low as to threaten my child.
I'll stay with my mother.<eos> You may have grown an inch since you stuck a man, but you'll still do as you're told.<eos> What choice did I have?<eos> I did it for Lucy.<eos> If you had... children then you'd understand.
No.<eos> What will you do, Charlotte?<eos> - I'll have to leave.<eos> - No! She risks hanging if she stays.<eos> You kill a man but it's me who has to run?
- It wasn't Ma that killed him.<eos> - Yes it was!<eos> She didn't wield the knife but she forced your legs open for any letch with a fortune.<eos> She let them fill your belly with anger and disgust.<eos> You did this!
I don't know you.<eos> Then I'll go and tell her that her concerns are misplaced.<eos> She's just been taken from me by the constables.<eos> For your murder?<eos> I don't know what she's told you but I assume you're the reason she couldn't settle with her gentleman.
Your acquaintance.<eos> I appreciate you bringing this to my attention.<eos> Have you been down to the cells to look at Charlotte Wells yet? - No, sir.<eos> - She's rumored to be the most beautiful whore in London.<eos> And you are a connoisseur of whores.
‚ô™ ‚ô™ We would have been free.<eos> There's a beggar looking for alms, Mother.<eos> Let me give her something.<eos> Don't be long.<eos> And make sure you lock the door behind you.
Her exit must be public.<eos> I want to see her legs cavort when she hangs.<eos> That means going to the justice.<eos> Quigley's got his pintle in her fist.<eos> Well, you're a little powderkeg, Emily.
I want to see her legs cavort when she hangs.<eos> That means going to the justice.<eos> Quigley's got his pintle in her fist.<eos> Well, you're a little powderkeg, Emily.<eos> You can bring them both to their knees.
Well, you're a little powderkeg, Emily.<eos> You can bring them both to their knees.<eos> Stab the bitch through the eyeballs.<eos> There is more than one way to bleed a sow.<eos> You saw Sir George Howard carried out of the Wells' house dead.
- Disgusting!<eos> Miss Wells, you are free to go.<eos> I knew the lies would not stand up.<eos> Not you.<eos> You stay.
No, I've been contriving your release ever since I heard of your arrest.<eos> - Nonsense.<eos> - I've been petitioning for you.<eos> To hang?<eos> You'd enjoy anything that gave my mother pain.
How can I act upon the word of a degenerate?<eos> Sir, I'm telling the truth.<eos> When I return, you will be gone for good.<eos> At liberty to fuck yourself into an early grave.<eos> I'm here because you said you'd speak for Mr. Marney.
So you may lock me in like the pallid China dolls out there?<eos> You need another keeper and you'll find one here.<eos> You will have every freedom and you'll keep all you earn, and believe me, I have never offered terms like that.<eos> Why do it now?<eos> What do you gain?
I asked you twice to take me in and you refused.<eos> Come now.<eos> How can you let her dupe and beguile you?<eos> Mrs. Quigley got me out of jail.<eos> You let them arrest me, Ma.
Mrs. Quigley got me out of jail.<eos> You let them arrest me, Ma.<eos> And Daniel Marney too.<eos> I did not.<eos> You sent the constables to take him.
The only safety is in money.<eos> Money is a woman's only power in this world.<eos> I'll earn mine here.<eos> She's using you, my love.<eos> As did you.
Nancy Birch wants me to squeak.<eos> She says my evidence would hang you.<eos> I'm willing to stay silent.<eos> I think your death would upset Charles.<eos> Your story will be pitched into a midden and you along with it like the dung worm that you are.
Whatever for?<eos> That's for him to say.<eos> Amelia Scanwell, a girl of faultless virtue, told me she saw Sir George Howard carried lifeless from your house.<eos> The Scanwell girl is lying, and I'll tell her so in court.<eos> You put his carcass into a coach and dumped it into St. James's Pond.
Amelia Scanwell, a girl of faultless virtue, told me she saw Sir George Howard carried lifeless from your house.<eos> The Scanwell girl is lying, and I'll tell her so in court.<eos> You put his carcass into a coach and dumped it into St. James's Pond.<eos> How did he die?<eos> Did you do it yourself, or are you protecting someone?
I'd like to hear her tell me so herself.<eos> No.<eos> She's just a child.<eos> A child with such a mother.<eos> And what will become of her when you burn?
No.<eos> She's just a child.<eos> A child with such a mother.<eos> And what will become of her when you burn?<eos> You did it, or your daughter did.
She's just a child.<eos> A child with such a mother.<eos> And what will become of her when you burn?<eos> You did it, or your daughter did.<eos> And you'll take the noose to protect her...
It is a blight on both our lives.<eos> I know of a house that you could take for a while.<eos> I offer it as charity, of course.<eos> Perhaps your daughter would like to see the place to see if it is convenient.<eos> Mrs. Wells, you are too good.
From her.<eos> From Mrs. Waterford.<eos> I'm sure you don't have anything to worry about.<eos> Mrs. Waterford would never hurt a child.<eos> You don't know her.
All right?<eos> Excuse me. I couldn't help overhearing.<eos> This man has been trying to tell you that he's very unhappy.<eos> Yeah?<eos> And what the hell would you know about it?
Oh, right.<eos> Would you, uh -- would you mind, professor?<eos> Well, he -- and my condolences -- says that he is dying.<eos> What? Congestive, uh, heart disease.<eos> He's been telling you that... You've been an awful, uh, selfish, absent father.
Yeah?<eos> W-what is it?<eos> I-I'll do anything.<eos> He says that he wants to live forever.<eos> and he thinks that you can help him do that.
There will be women...<eos> In time, if that's your desire.<eos> But it's my impression, herr starr, that what you really want is... "To sweep the streets clean of the parasites that befoul our society and create a civilization based on the principles of absolute order and uncompromising discipline."<eos> Your words, I believe.<eos> What if I told you that our organization feels exactly the same way you do?
Your words, I believe.<eos> What if I told you that our organization feels exactly the same way you do?<eos> Like a 10-inch dick, I'd need to see it to believe it.<eos> And maybe you shall.<eos> Tell me are you Christian, herr starr?
good luck.<eos> welcome to the grail.<eos> "The grail"? Please, herr starr, have a seat.<eos> For over 2,000 years, this organization has been at the very heart of world affairs.<eos> What do you think is the source of our enduring power?
The Samson unit of the grail handles the false prophets, contenders to Christ's throne.<eos> Our job is to rid the world of their competing narratives.<eos> Charlemagne. Lincoln.<eos> Belushi.<eos> You name it. You... Will be my right-hand man.
Mm.<eos> Yes, we did. And why did we do that?<eos> He preserved the union, won the war, sense of humor.<eos> His polling was probably through the roof.<eos> Something tells me you're going to do great things here, herr starr.
the cubs winning trump, this -- this flying pig.<eos> That's real wrath of god stuff, right?<eos> But sooner or later, there's always an explanation -- strong pitching, kgb interference, whatever.<eos> In the end, there's always a good reason.<eos> So you're just out here scaring people?
She killed herself.<eos> Hung herself from the ceiling.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I suppose she found her life... Unbearable.<eos> And you want... You want my life to be bearable.
Let's keep this simple.<eos> If your daughter misses school again, she's going to be suspended.<eos> Suspended?<eos> If Abby is going through some typical teenage problem that happens to any typical family like ours, instead of punishing her you should show her some compassion.<eos> And you shouldn't tell me how to do my job.
Thank you.<eos> Apology accepted.<eos> - I wasn't actually apologizing.<eos> - You just said you were sorry.<eos> I'm sorry about the situation, which you instigated.
She fired us, Donna.<eos> This isn't your fault.<eos> You couldn't have known.<eos> It's okay, I just need to go.<eos> You filed a complaint alleging life-threatening health problems, and I wanna help you get the compensation that you deserve.
What do you mean?<eos> Why is Harvey Specter negotiating this?<eos> I told you when we took him on, he's the best negotiator in the city.<eos> I don't care who he is.<eos> You're the one that came to me.
But I'm here to tell you, he went into prison one man, and he walked out another.<eos> And in my professional opinion, he has the integrity to serve his community as a lawyer.<eos> While I don't doubt your sincerity, Mr. Rowe, just because he was able to fool you doesn't mean he's going to be able to fool this board.<eos> It's Dr. Rowe.<eos> And I'm glad you were the one who responded to my statement.
While I don't doubt your sincerity, Mr. Rowe, just because he was able to fool you doesn't mean he's going to be able to fool this board.<eos> It's Dr. Rowe.<eos> And I'm glad you were the one who responded to my statement.<eos> - And why is that?<eos> - Because you tried to paint a false picture of his release, and I'm here to set the record straight.
And I'm glad you were the one who responded to my statement.<eos> - And why is that?<eos> - Because you tried to paint a false picture of his release, and I'm here to set the record straight.<eos> The record is straight.<eos> And you're not qualified to talk about the deal that he made.
It's true Mr. Ross entered into an early release agreement.<eos> But it's also true that he stayed in longer than he had to to keep his cellmate safe.<eos> And while he was there, he risked his own life to prevent a violent man from falsely obtaining parole.<eos> And for all we know, he did that for self-serving reasons.<eos> And for all I know, that's what you're doing right now.
Neither am I. I'm a prison psychologist.<eos> And in my experience, self-serving men do not risk their lives to help people.<eos> I don't call defrauding your fellow man helping people.<eos> And I certainly don't call it having integrity.<eos> With all due respect, ma'am, I'm done wasting my breath on you because the purpose of this hearing was to determine if Mike Ross had reformed. But you don't seem to be interested in that because you've already made your mind up.
And I certainly don't call it having integrity.<eos> With all due respect, ma'am, I'm done wasting my breath on you because the purpose of this hearing was to determine if Mike Ross had reformed. But you don't seem to be interested in that because you've already made your mind up.<eos> - Then maybe you shouldn't be on this committee.<eos> Because as I said, in my professional opinion, the world could use a lawyer like Mike Ross.<eos> And if you're looking for my personal opinion, he has more integrity in his little finger than you have in your whole body.
Good night, Harvey.<eos> I'll see you tomorrow at the hearing.<eos> Mr. Ross, we are prepared to hear your final statement.<eos> Before we do, I have one last question.<eos> Mr. Ross, you say you're a changed man and you care about the truth.
Before we do, I have one last question.<eos> Mr. Ross, you say you're a changed man and you care about the truth.<eos> But I want to know if you're capable of telling the truth.<eos> So I'm going to ask you a question and I suggest that you consider your answer very carefully, because as far as I'm concerned, your answer will determine whether or not you become a lawyer.<eos> During your time at Pearson Specter Litt, did anyone there have knowledge of the fact that you were a fraud?
I knew.<eos> And if you're looking for a scalp, you can have mine.<eos> But I was under the impression that this hearing was not about my old firm, but whether or not. Mr. Ross should be a lawyer.<eos> I say he should.<eos> It doesn't matter what you say.
But just because I showed compassion once doesn't mean he deserves it now.<eos> Maybe he doesn't.<eos> But that young woman is now an ER doctor.<eos> She saves lives.<eos> And the world's a better place because you saved hers.

Touch me like that, when she's there.<eos> I didn't mind it.<eos> I don't think you did either.<eos> What if she saw you?<eos> She could have me sent to the Colonies or worse and you know that.
My wife's book.<eos> I reread it on the plane.<eos> Such a thoughtful argument for domestic feminism, as it was called.<eos> Thank you. That's very kind.<eos> I heard you speak once at a rally, before the war, you were very passionate.
It was invaluable.<eos> Mexican chocolates, from my home town.<eos> Thank you, for helping me understand your world a bit.<eos> Under His eye.<eos> But you don't understand.
He has God in his heart, even if his mouth is sometimes a bit blasphemous.<eos> Hadn't noticed, sir.<eos> What's your opinion about all this?<eos> About the Handmaid issue.<eos> I think you're right, sir.
You're actually the flight attendant on the corporate jet of the bank that financed the merger.<eos> You're making it sound like I did something...<eos> She's making it sound like I did something wrong.<eos> I thought I was being smart for a change.<eos> You do know trading on inside information is a crime punishable by fine and imprisonment?
I just wanted to... buy an apartment.<eos> Believe me, I get it.<eos> Things are stacked against us in this city.<eos> Can you tell me this will all be okay?<eos> Michaela, I-I know you didn't mean to do anything wrong.
The moaning. Yeah.<eos> I know.<eos> I know. Would you like a drink, Mr. McKinnon?<eos> No.<eos> You're strong.
Magical aliens are gonna solve all the problems we created?<eos> It's important to keep exploring.<eos> I think we should take action in the here and now and stop looking to the stars for answers.<eos> Sister knows what's important.<eos> I'm not her, but if you think I sound like her, I'm flattered.
Are these all of your housing costs?<eos> Utilities, property taxes¬ê.<eos> Yes.<eos> All accounted for.<eos> I see you bring in $20,000 a year, Mr. Lane.
This must be fate.<eos> I'm in town for 36 hours, and I run into you.<eos> You're a woman that I have been dying to thank in person.<eos> You contributed on behalf of your daughter, Noa, To our cause.<eos> ¬ê You're one of those Mayer people.
Good Roberta.<eos> So dutiful.<eos> But now I think it was more for him.<eos> I want to know what really happened on Ganymede.<eos> And you're going to tell me.
I'll fix you up.<eos> You're lucky.<eos> It went straight through.<eos> How come I'm the one who always gets shot?<eos> Madam, you and I are fortunate to spend our lives in positions of great privilege and power.
Madam, you and I are fortunate to spend our lives in positions of great privilege and power.<eos> Our actions affect the lives of millions... Billions... Entire planets in ways that few people can even comprehend.<eos> The Eros experiment was never meant to be an attack on Earth, and I believe that you know that.<eos> I also believe that you understand what the protomolecule is, and what it represents for humanity.<eos> I can't afford to waste any more time finding allies, only for you to bring them down.
‚ô™ Five, make you fall in love with me ‚ô™<eos> - [Balloon Pops]<eos> Hello.<eos> Welcome to Cloud 9.<eos> And you must be the little princess we've been expecting.
Arthur?<eos> He's so sweet.<eos> We had no idea what he was saying to her.<eos> The security cameras don't have sound.<eos> I'm sorry, are you saying that you were spying on them as well?
But...<eos> I-I understand. Yes. Yes, ma'am.<eos> But I'm just now coming into possession of material information, a-and if I could have just a few more...<eos> No. Um, of course.<eos> As you wish.
Rhoades knew his man.<eos> As, as I'm sure you know, the attorney general has suspended my investigation and ordered me back to Washington.<eos> Well, I hope you've enjoyed your stay.<eos> Well...<eos> Do you know what I... what I like most about my job, Mr. Rhoades?
The same oath sworn by you, in fact, to the people of the United States.<eos> And when I see that someone is putting his own interests above that oath, there is nothing I like better than making sure they never get another job in the legal profession f-for the rest of their lives.<eos> Know this.<eos> I had you... in the cross hairs.<eos> But today, you're the man who brought down Lawrence Boyd.
And when I see that someone is putting his own interests above that oath, there is nothing I like better than making sure they never get another job in the legal profession f-for the rest of their lives.<eos> Know this.<eos> I had you... in the cross hairs.<eos> But today, you're the man who brought down Lawrence Boyd.<eos> You're... Elvis.
I'm not trying to sell myself to you.<eos> You didn't just put Sweeney out of the race. You crushed his spirit.<eos> No reason to do that unless you wanted to tell me something about you.<eos> Maybe I just couldn't help myself.<eos> Or maybe I knew you were dangling him to see what I would do.
- How can you be sure?<eos> - Because I...<eos> Because he wrote to me.<eos> "As I know you to be a man of sense," I am conscious you are, by this time, fully of opinion that the real interest and happiness of America consists in a reunion with Great Britain.<eos> I have taken a commission in the British Army and invite you to join me with as many men as you can bring over with you.
- You do.<eos> No, look at you. Look at that dress.<eos> My love, this is Rebecca Franks and Freddy Morgan, dear friends from Philadelphia.<eos> And this is my husband, General Arnold.<eos> General Arnold, how do you do?
To be an actress, and a truly great one such as yourself, you have to become the women you portray even though you know you're nothing like them.<eos> And then, once you've created the illusion of them through costume, through hairstyle, you have to create feelings out of thin air.<eos> Fear, anger, love.<eos> And then convince your audience that those feelings are, in fact, real when we know quite well they are not.<eos> I could never do what you do.
Sir, do you think that we should not risk this action or do you not trust me to lead it?<eos> How did you wait before showing me this letter from General Arnold? One day, sir.<eos> And only that because I gave it no regard.<eos> I never once gave him cause to think me a defector.<eos> I'm as disgusted by the insinuation as you must be.
As for my loyalty, I've taken my oaths, and it's never been questioned.<eos> Certainly not by my fatherinlaw, Admiral Sanders, of the Royal Navy.<eos> And you think you can hide your sins behind him?<eos> My sins are of the past.<eos> I'd hoped you at least be sympathetic, given your own.
They're ordered to be present.<eos> It just doesn't sound like him.<eos> Well, maybe you don't know him as well as she does.<eos> I hope you'll reconsider.<eos> You're the only one who can keep him in good humor.
- Woodhulls?<eos> - That's right.<eos> The rebel bastards have kidnapped Judge Woodhull and his son as payback.<eos> Cut him loose!<eos> Get him cleaned up or you'll be the one sitting in shit and piss.
Okay, well, Dr. Diane is an asshole, okay?<eos> I'll tell you what else, I'm not gonna carry that.<eos> I'm not carrying that either.<eos> Oh, Richard, can Catherine and I speak with you for a moment?<eos> Well, you're the boss.
I know, right?<eos> Well... - There's just one little thing.<eos> - Sure.<eos> We do need a bit more of the presidency in there.<eos> I mean, the book ends with you going off to college.
- It'll be my first human birth, so.<eos> - What is happening?<eos> - What is happening?<eos> - It just... - Gender is simple!<eos> - Right. - You're a girl, I'm a boy.
A book about my sex life. Seriously.<eos> I mean, obviously, we can't do that.<eos> - Yeah, you can't do that.<eos> - Really? Why can't we?<eos> - You can do that.
- Candi, are you all right?<eos> - Of course she's all right. Why are women always checking in on one another when I am talking to them?<eos> Ma'am, I would appreciate it very much if I could have an invite to the unveiling thing.<eos> That is President Meyer's invitation list.<eos> It is her fiesta, as you would say.
- Of course she's all right. Why are women always checking in on one another when I am talking to them?<eos> Ma'am, I would appreciate it very much if I could have an invite to the unveiling thing.<eos> That is President Meyer's invitation list.<eos> It is her fiesta, as you would say.<eos> Well, it's your casa white-o, as you would say.
And I asked them to use the Jackie Kennedy crystal service.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yep. Nobody since Jackie has given as much for their country as you.<eos> That is true.<eos> If Jackie Kennedy can go through the day with her husband's philandering brains all over her dress and her head held high, looking stunning, even though they made her ride around in a convertible like an animal, I might add, you can go to the White House tomorrow and forget all about those 15 minutes where he couldn't even unzip the back of your dress.
Yes, I would like that very much.<eos> - Boom goes the dynamite.<eos> - You're fired.<eos> Yes!<eos> Ma'am, "The Tonight Show" is ripshit because you canceled.
You stole it.<eos> It's got the terrorist drone assassination. Richard:<eos> Well, that sounds bad.<eos> - The DRA guy?<eos> - Yeah, and the Chinese. It's got the soldier whose leg you lost.
We were telling so many lies, I had to write them down to keep them straight.<eos> Any decent lawyer would've told me to do that.<eos> Ma'am, they've got the data breach.<eos> - No.<eos> - They know that you 100% knew about the mining of those dead kids' social security and medical data.
I know!<eos> - Leon West is on "CBS This Morning" right now.<eos> Selina:<eos> Oh, my God, put it on really quick.<eos> Even you would admit that freeing Tibet from Chinese rule is a monumental achievement.
Zafar's bruises.<eos> It was Dad's friends from the lodge that beat him up.<eos> He told them to do it after he caught us together.<eos> Why didn't you tell us this sooner?<eos> Because I thought you were one of them, in the police.
I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> You sent your own daughter round to kill the man she loved.<eos> You've made a mistake.<eos> I... I need to get home to cook.<eos> You're not going home unless you can refute the allegations made against you.
He shouldn't have been here in the first place!<eos> He didn't fit.<eos> He... He didn't belong.<eos> Not like us, not like we do.<eos> And where do you belong Rosie?
I think she was down to you or a broom, and the broom was busy.<eos> If I'm doing this, we have to use our best acting skills, 'cause who's gonna believe you landed me?<eos> Ugh, really wish Steve the Broom didn't have Pilates at 4:00.<eos> I'm so sorry, Mrs. Ferraro.<eos> I had no idea you were the awful boss that was making her life miserable.
Can't you see I'm doing my best!<eos> I'm wandering around the wilderness with the Wormless Wonder searching for something that was never meant to be found!<eos> And you're wrong.<eos> Me and Quinlan, we're just foot soldiers for the cause.<eos> You... you're the one we're all counting on to turn this around.
And no noodles.<eos> Just broth.<eos> I've never even heard of this Sweet Lady Pain person.<eos> She was the local dominatrix murdered in her dungeon.<eos> You reported the story on the news.
I'm not having a good day.<eos> The transcriptions of your chats with your wife's sister, everything from the last few weeks.<eos> What do you want?<eos> that is, your authorization... to raise subscriber fees.<eos> Come now, you can convince anyone.
[sighs] Why'd they lock you up?<eos> It was a mistake.<eos> I'm not a thief.<eos> In this city, just looking like one can get you in here.<eos> You don't look like a thief, and you're in this cell, too.
Never. I mean, she doesn't work here anymore.<eos> She went home because she couldn't handle city life.<eos> Well... [clears throat] All right, then.<eos> Thanks a lot. Sorry to bother you.<eos> And you are...
Always the bad.<eos> The president's approvals are down to 19%.<eos> And the good?<eos> They're worse for Congress.<eos> And you're at 30.
I feel I am in a purgatory of sorts.<eos> Thyra will not go to Ragnar.<eos> She is happy here in Winchester with you.<eos> - Nonsense.<eos> - Beocca, you are her peace.
We have an invitation.<eos> Who leads here?<eos> - You?<eos> - I do.<eos> I am Haesten, and you are Uhtred of Bebbanburg.
Lord Uhtred.<eos> I see you now.<eos> The gods have had their sacrifice and the brothers have tonight begun that which cannot be stopped.<eos> Lunden's streets are red with Saxon blood.<eos> You are to be King.
Even my wife-to-be sings his praises...<eos> Leave us.<eos> I do not like him and he doesn't like me.<eos> From the moment that we met.<eos> You are a threat, lord.
Know this, if thou hast gone aside to another man, the Lord shall make thy thigh to rot and thy belly to swell. Amen.<eos> Amen.<eos> Child... you will now drink... the bitter waters.<eos> This will not be necessary.<eos> You are pure and may God strike me down this very instant if you are not.
Maybe you have doubts.<eos> Maybe you've felt something missing in your life and you don't know quite what it is.<eos> That's fine.<eos> God is patient.<eos> And when you're ready, I promise you,
But Lee and I moved on from how we were raised.<eos> And, uh, what is it that Lee believes in again?<eos> Just the facts.<eos> Okay.<eos> I've always been kind of curious, but, uh, lately, you know, having Alison and now...
Just the facts.<eos> Okay.<eos> I've always been kind of curious, but, uh, lately, you know, having Alison and now...<eos> It's just starting to seem more important to know.<eos> And I don't believe that it was a coincidence that you came to the restaurant...
Am I right?<eos> - Well, true.<eos> So, why did all four gospel writers record that it was women who discovered the empty tomb?<eos> It... So I'm asking you that.<eos> Well, if you were a first-century Jew making up this story out of thin air, then you would never say that women discovered the tomb.
- Has Florence been drinking?<eos> - No.<eos> - She's having a baby.<eos> The joys of motherhood.<eos> Some species of shark have a gestation period of 3¬Ω years, - so you're getting off lightly. - Hm.
I want to be with you.<eos> Oh, please!<eos> You think you can just come in here in your suit and be like, "Uh, I wanna be with you, Max."<eos> You say you love me, you say you can't live without me, and then you go and live without me.<eos> You, sir, are unreliable.
Tear it up, use it to stoke your campfire.<eos> It is an invitation, sir, from your commander in chief to join the fight against the British.<eos> I'm not interested.<eos> Mr. Banneker.<eos> You... clearly have skills.
The other Barons respect him.<eos> If Quinn had kept his counsel, he'd probably still be alive.<eos> Let's be honest with each other.<eos> You married a Baron, killed him and took his title.<eos> I defended myself against a monster, as I'm sure you would've.
This isn't about commerce.<eos> It's about a way of life.<eos> One that my ancestors helped build.<eos> We've kept the Badlands running smoothly for over a century by providing a labor force.<eos> And yet, you have chosen to wage a war against that reality.
So it's a good thing you get to stay here, right?<eos> That is, unless you keep making scenes like this.<eos> Sir, I just hate to see you have to interrupt your work.<eos> This is my goddamn work!<eos> If you and your staff can't handle these little disturbances, I'm gonna have to.
So, what do you say?<eos> You gonna help me, Miranda?<eos> No.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Guess I'm not as civic-minded as you are.
I brought you here to protect Operation Marigold, and if you were doing something like this, I needed to know.<eos> With respect, I disagree.<eos> Cultivating a relationship with spies is a delicate process.<eos> Your area of expertise is energy, not intelligence.<eos> You worry about your oil; I'll worry about the spies.
The Capitol's been attacked.<eos> Eagle is gone.<eos> - Congress, the cabinet.<eos> - Oh, oh, my God.<eos> Sir, you are now the president.
What's the protocol for that?<eos> Well, sir, if you're unconscious, that means you'll be incapable to discharge your duties as president.<eos> So we'll have to invoke the 25th Amendment.<eos> Okay, how do we do that?<eos> We'll notify the Speaker of the House and the president pro tem of the Senate through a signed and written statement that you'll be temporarily vacating the office.
Good afternoon.<eos> My name is Mike Ritter, Secret Service.<eos> I'm assigned to the president's personal protection detail.<eos> Yesterday you were brought to the president's attention by Speaker Hookstraten.<eos> She said you claimed to have had information about Vice President MacLeish before he was confirmed.
They're going to administer the anesthetic.<eos> And then I'll ask you to please count down backwards from 100.<eos> 100 99 98 97 96 95...<eos> The president is unconscious.<eos> Sir, you're now the acting president of the United States.
Agent Wells, do you recognize this man?<eos> _<eos> All right.<eos> Can't say I didn't try.<eos> You know, maybe Foerstel's right about you.
Gun!<eos> No!<eos> Several bullet fragments lodged in your chest.<eos> We need to operate as soon as possible.<eos> Sir, you're now the acting president of the United States.
Mr. President, I appreciate that you have a job to do, But I wouldn't be doing mine if I didn't advise you against leaving the hospital so soon after surgery.<eos> Captain, I understand completely.<eos> But I really do have to get back.<eos> It's a matter of national security.<eos> And you were the one who said you were really happy with my progress.
She'll be there.<eos> I take it you're a fan of President Moss?<eos> I handed out yard signs during his first campaign, actually.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> So, how long have you and Langdon been in contact?
But it's like I said...<eos> You were simply outgunned.<eos> So don't be too hard on yourself.<eos> I won't, Mr. President.<eos> I'll let you take care of that.
This is Contreras.<eos> Smart.<eos> What are you going to do with the time?<eos> It's not what I'm gonna do with it.<eos> It's what I want you to.
As a private citizen?<eos> Preferably as Secretary of State.<eos> I know that you've retired from public service, but your country needs you.<eos> I need you.<eos> Hell, you helped me get into this mess.
She doesn't have a file.<eos> I didn't finish my turn, so I was sent this.<eos> Compliments of Jenna Marshall.<eos> We're gonna take a nice little drive to go visit your friend, Jenna.<eos> And on the way there, you're gonna tell us about how the two of you know someone with the initials A.D.
- What?<eos> Where are the rules for this stupid game anyways?<eos> Every time we fail a turn, the cops get of a piece of Archer?<eos> What's next, his knee caps or his ear lobes?<eos> Or the video of you two digging up the grave.
- Did you follow me?<eos> - I had to, you lied to me.<eos> Here's what's gonna happen.<eos> We're gonna take a nice little drive to go visit your friend Jenna.<eos> And on the way there, you're gonna tell us about how the two of you know someone with the initials A.D.
'Cause she doesn't have one of these.<eos> Okay, guys, I know we all woke up early and we're cranky, but let's stay focused.<eos> I'm as freaked out as the rest of you.<eos> Maybe even more, considering it looks like. A.D. was watching Ali and me sleep last night.<eos> Wait, so are you two...
What's this, celestial enemies' night out?<eos> Why don't you have a seat, Lucifer.<eos> There's something that we need to tell you.<eos> Ooh, some sort of supernatural intervention, is it?<eos> Well, doesn't matter what shenanigans you two have got cooking up, 'cause, quite frankly, I'm too happy for you to spoil things.
I think we can leave this here.<eos> -What are you doing here?<eos> -I've come to help.<eos> We don't need your help.<eos> I understand why you're angry, but I need you to listen to me.
There's a seat here.<eos> Right there.<eos> They were dirty women.<eos> They were sluts.<eos> But you are special girls.
I'm gonna text her.<eos> Oh, hey.<eos> I'm Bobby.<eos> I did the work on your bar.<eos> You must be Max and Caroline.
I have to go.<eos> If it's about the call, I can talk to Sara.<eos> -[Alba] I don't want you to.<eos> -But she can help.<eos> I don't want you to help me. Not you, not √Ångeles, none of you!
Her foot's trapped!<eos> Weller, he's getting away.<eos> No, he's not.<eos> I'll get him.<eos> You two get Patterson!
That'll be you, Warren, with Cross assisting.<eos> - Yes!<eos> - Thank you, Dr. Minnick.<eos> No.<eos> Edwards and Wilson, you'll be in O.R. 3 working on the boy with Dr. Karev.
It sounds boring, but it's actually fascinating.<eos> - Oh, fun.<eos> - What is happening?<eos> Weekend of the 25th, I'll be out of town, so you'll have Harriet.<eos> Ah. You two taking a vacation?
Okay, you know what?<eos> To be clear, that particular decision was made by Bailey.<eos> - Isn't that right, Warren?<eos> - Let's just leave me out of this.<eos> Even if Minnick's program was good, the way you two went about implementing the entire thing had zero respect for the history of this institution, certainly no respect for Dr. Webber.
I am not going there, it just makes me think of Kasper.<eos> ARE YOU HOME?<eos> I HAVE FORGOTTEN MY KEY<eos> It was amazing when Kasper was in the window.<eos> - You both got so scared! - I thought somebody died!
- Of course.<eos> I'm gonna help reshape the agency.<eos> And get your hands dirty.<eos> Well, hopefully not just my hands.<eos> You two have sacrificed a lot for our country.
We'll do our Dirty Dancing routine from the fourth-grade talent show!<eos> But we lost.<eos> Well, that's only because I dropped you and you broke your arm.<eos> You guys, I'll get Macy to sing "Time Of My Life"<eos> and you two dance like it's 1987.
- Pick a topic.<eos> About Charlotte not meeting her that night.<eos> That's probably true.<eos> It's too easy to check.<eos> While you two are discussing this, let's remember that I was the one that was in a line-up.
Daddy, will you judge our screaming contest?<eos> Of course he will!<eos> Hit it, girls!<eos> Okay!<eos> You won.
Luke and i are here because we each want your votes.<eos> However, certain people want to change us Into being something each of us is not.<eos> They're publicly shaming us.<eos> We deserve it.<eos> The important thing is you two leaned something.
I'm gonna have to take my pants off.<eos> Now you see how it happens.<eos> If you don't mind, I think I'm gonna have my dessert later.<eos> You sure?<eos> Yeah, I've got to finish my homework, and I bet you two want some alone time.
I just got you guys back in the same house.<eos> I've never had sisters.<eos> It's nice.<eos> But it's going to implode.<eos> You know it, and I know it.
But it's going to implode.<eos> You know it, and I know it.<eos> So have at it.<eos> Go to town over the cabinets.<eos> If you're gonna kill each other, just do it already.
To Aria.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> - And I better be a bridesmaid.<eos> - You kidding me?<eos> You're all gonna be up there with me.
Is there any way that we can get in touch with your father?<eos> We-we just need to ask him a couple of questions.<eos> Look, I don't know where my father is.<eos> I haven't spoken to him in years.<eos> You two seem nice enough.
No, we were in my dream.<eos> Catch up.<eos> You guys, he burned us out of the storm cellar and he wrote on that window.<eos> He probably killed Sara and we know he's bad because way back when he pushed that sorority girl down the stairs.<eos> Hanna, what about Sara telling me we're looking for the same thing you are?
Do you think Noel wrote it?<eos> I don't know what to think anymore.<eos> Well, whoever A.D. is they're still one step ahead of us.<eos> Uh, not necessarily.<eos> You got to the doctors first.
Oh, come on, Wendy.<eos> Hospital rules.<eos> Only two visitors at a time.<eos> Somebody's got to go.<eos> You two grab a snack.
Will you please stop reorganizing?<eos> I need to keep busy when I'm nervous.<eos> We can't call INS because they will find out we're not really married.<eos> - Right.<eos> - You are married.
She's stronger than I am.<eos> She could defeat me.<eos> There's two of us.<eos> We got her outnumbered.<eos> You two are staying.
You know, it's nice to get to know someone that Jules is gonna be spending so much time with.<eos> Oh, no, no, no.<eos> That's for you.<eos> So I'm glad you texted me.<eos> I left pretty soon after you did last night.
Great to see you.<eos> You remember Naomi?<eos> We're expecting maximum attendance around 8:00 p.m.<eos> Madeline will introduce Alison, who will say a few words, and hand over the floor to you.<eos> You draw up the play and I'll run it.
You should get back out front.<eos> My wife has big news.<eos> See?<eos> The bear didn't sink through the pool cover.<eos> You won't, either.
Okay, thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I couldn't save them.<eos> They weren't strong enough.<eos> They died so that you could live.
I've had the thankless task of sending home some of my most beautiful and talented girls.<eos> Now, for "All Stars," I've decided to turn over a new leaf.<eos> Yesterday, I promised<eos> I wouldn't be eliminating any of you, and that's true.<eos> Because this season, you'll be eliminating...
Thank you.<eos> See?<eos> You should not be ordering her around like that.<eos> I should be ordering her around like that.<eos> You two need to learn to share.
The kids are down.<eos> Enough business.<eos> Cheers, mate.<eos> On your left.<eos> I knew you and Ryan were keeping something from me.
Except for Gene Rayburn, who is, in fact, dead.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> I can't catch a break.<eos> That's fine, 'cause we actually have an idea that we are very excited about.<eos> Well, if you're excited, I'm excited.
- Monica!<eos> I needed the money for school, and I knew Tatiana would take the blame because she steals things.<eos> You do see how this is your fault?<eos> I am not gonna live in a one-room apartment while my wife gets half my salary!<eos> You killed Tatiana! You did!
he's looking for news all the time.<eos> What you mean?<eos> What's he after?<eos> Anything... news about Shelley or why Segunda is named like that although she's the third one...<eos> You know it then!
Mom, Ramona... are there any more turns of events?<eos> If so, stop the projection cause I don't wanna hear them!<eos> The projection! It'll be over by now!<eos> Let's go!<eos> And don't you dare do this again in 10 years!
- Get out of here.<eos> - Let me take Andy's place.<eos> Don't be stupid.<eos> I'll go willingly...<eos> And you'll be safe.
I've no clue what you're talking about.<eos> Malcolm Danvers.<eos> I want him back.<eos> Well, you're not getting him.<eos> Then you're not getting this ring.
Who's desperate now?<eos> You saw what they did to him.<eos> But where will I go?<eos> Anywhere but here.<eos> You would save me.
Hello, neighbor.<eos> We're the welcome wagon.<eos> We heard you had a window.<eos> Aren't you sweet to come by?<eos> This is Beverly. And who are you?
You ruined her life.<eos> You ruined all of our lives.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> They did.<eos> When you two were babies, I tried to contact them anonymously to let them know that I was the donor.
D-man?<eos> L-bomb?<eos> You look good.<eos> Umm, did something?<eos> Did you two?
But part of the responsibility that goes along with being a star is learning to share the spotlight.<eos> Maybe she's gonna get the solos because she needs it more than you do right now.<eos> Truth is, Mercedes, Rachel will make you better.<eos> Her drive and ambition will help you raise your expectations of yourself, and you can use that to become great.<eos> And I have a feeling you two are gonna become great friends. (scoffs) (sniffles)
I would not miss the one, and then you were born.<eos> You were beautiful.<eos> You had a light about you.<eos> It put a smile on the face of the hardest man I had ever known, and when Dahlia took you,<eos> I believed that same light might warm her embittered heart, that you would lead a good life.
That way, the bar would be consistently empty.<eos> We would always have seats.<eos> The bar will be full.<eos> I'm working on live music.<eos> And you will always have seats.
And then we're all gonna die!<eos> - That doesn't even make any sense.<eos> - None of that could possibly happen.<eos> Other people's dreams are so boring.<eos> Haven't you two got any common sense? Mm-hmm. Well, the Truitt brothers believe it.
She's making a move.<eos> Oh, my God. What do I tell her?<eos> Tell her you're in.<eos> What?<eos> You two have some drinks.
Otherwise, table eight.<eos> Now.<eos> Got it.<eos> I believe true love-making must include a third participant.<eos> I would be honored if you'd join us.
I need Miller.<eos> ~ Yeah.<eos> Course you do.<eos> Claire just handed me this pendant.<eos> You two should have plenty to talk about.
- What the fuck?<eos> !<eos> - Enough!<eos> Enough!<eos> You two are the people I love most in the world.
[Woman coughs] Oh, come on. [Coughs]<eos> Let's not name the next one.<eos> Hurts too bad when you fail.<eos> If Jane asks, you rowed.<eos> You two have a unique relationship, don't you?
Parsons is in dire need of a fresh start, so Shaw kills Walsh, sells his I.D. to Parsons, and then everything's back to business as usual.<eos> - Until they found Walsh's body.<eos> - Right.<eos> And Shaw knew that the body would lead to Parsons, so he flew to Boston and took him out.<eos> You two are like a regular Cagney and Lacey.
Oh, that was indiscreet.<eos> The point I was trying to make is this...<eos> A friend is like a business.<eos> Investing in the wrong one always proves costly.<eos> And like Heather, I'm sure that you would all want me to keep your secrets secret.
I thought Sergio was on the food truck.<eos> He better not have left his wiener apron in my car again.<eos> [laughs] Sergio no est√° aqu√≠.<eos> Dumb bitch falls for it every time.<eos> You two seem to have developed quite the playful dynamic.
Uh, we're gonna head back to the hospital.<eos> FYI, we're still working the Thomas case.<eos> Didn't someone tell you?<eos> Tell us what? Homeland Security's taking over.<eos> You two are off the case.
It doesn't really make any sense, we can just do away with it, but sexism isn't going anywhere, 'cause sexism is way deep the fuck down inside, so it's just the way we feel about each other.<eos> It's, "Ahh, women!<eos> "Women!<eos> Women! "Women!<eos> And you're like, "Men!
My sweet, sweet, sweet dirt.<eos> Hello, trowel.<eos> You're gonna be digging.<eos> Hello, shears.<eos> You're gonna be trimming.
Oleg was wrong.<eos> And those nipples were way too big.<eos> This is awkward.<eos> You're in the truck?<eos> No, you're in my apartment.
We went to go rescue you, but you'd already escaped.<eos> Aw, thanks for trying, but you know you shouldn't worry about me.<eos> I'm like black Die Hard.<eos> Ugh, fine, you didn't lie-- or you're both lying-- I don't care.<eos> I can't believe Deaf Taylor Swift and Number Two are dead and you two are still alive.
You don't think we would actually pardon a turkey, do you?<eos> It's more like a stay of execution until no one is looking.<eos> But why here?<eos> Ah. Well, I was disinvited to Thanksgiving at my in-laws' because they still think that I killed their son, my jerk-off ex-husband, so I'm kind of on my own.<eos> Plus, you girls have the best cooking facilities on campus, although it doesn't look like you ever use them.
I don't entirely know what you whores could have been doing that was more important than helping your chapter president drown a serial killer, but unless that thing you were doing was getting enemas of pure liquid gold at a new local establishment called<eos> Liquid Gold Colonics for Young Sluts, like if you were doing literally anything else, you all should seriously consider doing the human race a favor and getting sterilized.<eos> I'm not being facetious.<eos> I literally think you should consider undergoing a surgical procedure to remove your ovaries, thereby sparing human race exposure to your DNA.<eos> You four trollops are the worst specimens of human beings ever born, and you all should really watch your backs, because if this serial killer targeting Kappa House doesn't chop off your heads, I'm going to do it!
Clearly Melanie Dorkus is stalking the campus with a shovel in a veil, all pissed off because her face got burnt off, and I want to let bygones be bygones.<eos> But I thought that you said that you weren't the person who put the acid in the spray tanner.<eos> Well, I didn't, but she thinks I did.<eos> So here's the plan...<eos> We're gonna go to her house, I'm gonna fake apologize, you'll record it, we'll post it online, and it'll all be fine.
First, tell her she's awesome.<eos> And pretty.<eos> If she was awesome and pretty, I wouldn't be dumping her.<eos> Just do it, you pig.<eos> We all know I'm not gonna do it, so if you want it done, here.
She shouldn't take the blame for it.<eos> Unh. She wouldn't take it if she didn't want to.<eos> Believe me, Beckett has plenty of experience taking a bullet for other people doing stupid things.<eos> Hell, she's married to me.<eos> But, uh, you supercops need to stick together, right?
"Look at us, not having to trade cigarettes for tampons."<eos> Yeah.<eos> Or kisses for soap.<eos> 8:00 a.m., Sunday.<eos> You're driving.
Just like a shotgun.<eos> We'll go full.<eos> Me and you, we'll go full, Gadget.<eos> - Mate, mate, one at least.<eos> - Girls, you go halves on one.
My head sweats like a watermelon at a picnic.<eos> Please don't fire us over the Nash situation.<eos> It was out of our hands.<eos> Actually, it was in her hands, and it was only 18.<eos> You two embarrassed my girlfriend.
No way.<eos> Come on.<eos> Ok.<eos> Let's do this.<eos> You two are up first.
We do.<eos> Eva and I were in the... alternate reality, as strange as it sounds.<eos> Sounds pretty strange.<eos> Everyone in the cocoons was from Chester's Mill.<eos> But you're not.
At least now you can stop worrying that he's some kind of pedophile.<eos> She probably drives a minivan.<eos> I don't know, that seems weird.<eos> Hi!<eos> You must be Meg and Markayla.
Bobby's so hot.<eos> He's asking for a picture.<eos> His mom is gonna pick us up and he's gonna meet us at the concert.<eos> Hi.<eos> You must be Meg and Markayla.
We're not talking about just anybody here.<eos> We're talking about Alison.<eos> You know, people can change.<eos> She helped you find us.<eos> Right, 'cause she needed you and Mona alive.
Yeah, I'm sorry.<eos> It was very rude and we're all very sorry.<eos> But we had these emergencies come up.<eos> No, I understand if it was an emergency.<eos> But you all had emergencies?
It's kind of hard to hunt for cloths and pick emojis at the same time.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I was just checking with Sara.<eos> I wanted to see how her first day was going.<eos> Well, you two seem to have gotten pretty close.
You know, she's still trying to figure out how to stand on her own and... and...<eos> You're the only thing holding her up.<eos> You know, I've only known her for a couple of weeks, but... it's just been intense.<eos> She's still trapped in a nightmare.<eos> Well, I-I think you all are.
Go to Truth or Consequences.<eos> See what you can find out.<eos> The Doctor will go to Turmezistan.<eos> Negotiate peace, rescue Osgood, and prevent this war, cos that's what he does.<eos> Clara, Jac -- you stay here.
We don't have a lot of time.<eos> Tell me you have a plan.<eos> Nomes and I will cover the East Wall, look for survivors, arm them, and fight.<eos> Alex, there won't be enough.<eos> You two get to the War Room.
Ok.<eos> Good luck with that.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> Nothing.<eos> No. You two will fit in just fine.
Mostly one at 6th and Waverley.<eos> That's about a block away from Washington Square Park, doper central.<eos> And, the last withdrawal was made the same day Nina was killed.<eos> Okay, this could be our killer.<eos> You two finish up, send me that info.
Women of equal sexual viability hate each other.<eos> Even if they pretend to like each other.<eos> And that is how it has worked since the day vagina's were invented.<eos> See, okay, look.<eos> You're like these two, all right?
By glasses, you mean bottles.<eos> By bottles, you mean cases.<eos> No, I mean glasses.<eos> I hope you're okay with it.<eos> You girls are my family.
Well, brace yourself for this.<eos> You look hot now.<eos> Manny, you're up.<eos> Forgive my friend.<eos> It's just that you two are so beautiful, it's a little intimidating.
It's not so bad here in the land of the brutal, my friend.<eos> I'll be sure to give you a warm welcome when you arrive.<eos> All right.<eos> I see how it is. See how what is?<eos> You turned this into a guy-versus-girls thing.
That's what John saw in these stories.<eos> You've been working from a false assumption all along.<eos> Code 14.<eos> Corruption in the data set, redo calculation from start.<eos> You used it yourselves to get to see me.
But Marta would have had to get her hands on an actual machine.<eos> A Type X or a German Enigma.<eos> And she'd have to know how to use one.<eos> There were two intercept stations at Malta.<eos> They had staff, they would have been trained, just like you were.
I'm sorry.<eos> What for?<eos> For tonight.<eos> It doesn't matter much, in the scheme of things.<eos> You two always used to end up side by side.
I am impressed.<eos> Got to say, didn't think you would pull this one off.<eos> That's because you underestimate me.<eos> And lo and behold, I proved you wrong.<eos> Let me take a picture of you being wrong.
She says there's proof.<eos> Of what?<eos> (CRIES) Oh, dear God.<eos> Whatever your motives... ..thank you.<eos> No-one would ever have known if you two hadn't gone poking around.
If I'd have done you, you wouldn't look like you'd been jammed through a blender.<eos> The most important thing is that you're safe.<eos> None of us are safe!<eos> Why can't you understand that?<eos> You are coming with us.
Remember when that was you, Chapman?<eos> A lost little kumquat looking for a place to sit.<eos> What's she in for?<eos> Some kind of political protest.<eos> You know, the two of you might have a lot to talk about.
Yeah, last week I took her parking spot, and she called me a communist.<eos> You can't take it personally.<eos> Hi. I'm Liam.<eos> Shane.<eos> And you are...
Do you want to take Grace to school?<eos> - I mean, you're here.<eos> - Oh, no, no.<eos> That's okay.<eos> You two go ahead.
There is no place in Jupiter for freaks.<eos> Don't call us freaks!<eos> I'll call you whatever the hell I want to, you freak...<eos> You saved us.<eos> And you're gonna save us.
Where's Rainer?<eos> Alright.<eos> Get your coats.<eos> - Where are we going?<eos> - You two are the experts.
Solve the breach.<eos> How are the KGB getting our information?<eos> We need to keep him alive.<eos> Meeting over.<eos> You two remind me of my brothers.
Because I have control issues, I know.<eos> But I have to defend myself here.<eos> Because this might be my last chance.<eos> And I've thought long and hard about this.<eos> And it seems like you two have created this narrative wherein I'm the bad guy.
... maybe they weren't your real friends to begin with.<eos> Look, you know what?<eos> Don't feed me that coercion bullshit.<eos> I didn't hold a gun to any of your heads.<eos> You wanted to.
- I'm not going back there.<eos> - I know she's not perfect, but she's done better by you than I did by her.<eos> Well, why don't you live with her?<eos> Well, some things you can't fix.<eos> And I just hope you two never get there.
- him?<eos> - Because remember before when this whole goddamn thing was your fault?<eos> !<eos> - Just asking.<eos> - Lana and Mother, you should go with them, because my plan may not work.
Because if we miss that taping, I won't be responsible for my actions.<eos> - Are you ever?<eos> - She said, single and<eos> - pregnant.<eos> - Can you two please go... anywhere else?
- Oh, I love it already.<eos> - (mouth full) Me, too.<eos> Okay, they're gonna let the audience in, in a second, but before they do, I wanted to share a message with you from your teacher... miss Paulina... who, unfortunately, couldn't be with us tonight.<eos> Um, and she said,<eos> "tonight..." "you are the keepers of your own pixie dust."
Here you go, Sophie.<eos> See, Max, we have a customer.<eos> And just so you know, I'm not gonna pay.<eos> Oh, I'm so glad you stayed open, even with all this snow everywhere.<eos> You know, good for you.
No more guards, no more servants, no one else you can threaten or bribe.<eos> So you're the strong one.<eos> Are you also the smart one, Lola?<eos> If so, you'd know you've already let your queen down.<eos> You three coming here tells me she's not in the castle.
Yeah, just take my word for it.<eos> I know I couldn't keep my hands off my first love.<eos> I'm talking, of course, about my penis.<eos> I've had enough!<eos> You two girls walk all over me.
FBI doesn't pay your salary.<eos> NYPD does.<eos> Right.<eos> Bottom line.<eos> Now... I don't know what your deal with Lowan was-- maybe he was afraid to criticize the chick team, 'cause it's not "PC," but you two are the weak link here.
Zoe, Lemon, I believe you two know each other.<eos> Now, I am gonna be out of commission for the rest of the morning. - All day.<eos> - All day.<eos> And in interesting news, you both are trying to decide whether or not to go on a date tomorrow.<eos> So you two talk to each other. You need to.
I have no self-esteem.<eos> And I can see the bottom of your balls.<eos> Max, remember two days ago when you loved the bottom of my balls?<eos> That's when they were poor and I felt sorry for them.<eos> Come on, you two belong together.
It's like a heterosexual tax.<eos> Feels icky, doesn't it?<eos> But all proceeds go to the Trevor project, a crisis and suicide hotline for LGBTQ youth, so yay.<eos> Everybody wins.<eos> You two coming together?
I love lesbian humor.<eos> Look, I didn't have a chance to order a second tiara, so would one of you be willing to wear the crown?<eos> I'm guessing Amy, but I don't want to make assumptions.<eos> Yeah, that crown is definitely more her.<eos> In a world with so much darkness, you two are such bright lights. Uhhuh.
Of course I'm attracted to you.<eos> How could I not be? I do have one leg that's shorter than the other.<eos> - It's Amy.<eos> Oh, right, Amy, my girlfriend.<eos> Look, maybe you two are okay with this sneaking around thing, but I'm not.
Do you want him to forward this to the whole school or not?<eos> - Still hate you.<eos> - Still hate you too, boo.<eos> If Amy knew about this, you honestly think she'd be okay with it?<eos> Maybe you two are okay with this sneaking-around thing, but I'm not.
I did not know that. Um...<eos> Are you guys sure?<eos> Well, we're sure.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> I'm totally sure if you are.
Can you wait?<eos> - Totally.<eos> Not even oral?<eos> Never mind.<eos> - You two will work it out.
Do you really want to be the only girls to turn up with your V plates intact?<eos> She's talking about us being virgins still.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I got it.<eos> You girls need to get it in the bag, and quick.
No.<eos> Wait here, I'll see if I can get closer.<eos> Victory.<eos> Or death.<eos> You two princesses made it.
It's true.<eos> - Oh, man, you were perfect.<eos> - No, you were perfect.<eos> W-w-wait a second.<eos> - Did you two...
Lovely?<eos> You obviously never had your washing soaked in rain before.<eos> You brought it upon yourself when you got married early.<eos> I know!<eos> You girls stick it out as long as you can.
I really wasn't going to tell you but I will just once.<eos> So, listen carefully.<eos> And no questions.<eos> Okay.<eos> You remember about the war between this country and the Qing Dynasty.
Ga-bi, you got to distract his men.<eos> Excuse me...<eos> What about the blueprint?<eos> I will take care of that!<eos> You concentrate on your job.
We aren't.<eos> Your point?<eos> Val, I'm not sure you fully understand what those extensions really mean.<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> They mean that you old ladies are behind the times.
What are you doing here?<eos> She said you wanted me to come.<eos> I never said that.<eos> Okay, it doesn't matter who said what or whether any of it was true.<eos> The important thing is is that you're... you're both here together.
I wish you were going.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> I really don't. Is that bad?<eos> No.<eos> You're having a girls' weekend,
No, I mean, we're gonna have to leave this place.<eos> We couldn't do it with Lester.<eos> I know, that's why I'm here.<eos> You don't have to do this for us.<eos> If you two didn't live in this building, then we'd drift apart and we'd only see each other on saturdays for coffee.
* Watch out, watch out * * Ba, ba, ba-ba-ba *<eos> * Look out, look out * * Ba, ba, ba-ba-ba *<eos> * Watch out, watch out * * Ba, ba, ba-ba-ba *<eos> * Look out, look out * * Ba, ba, ba-ba-ba *<eos> * Girls, you know you better *
She's watching HGTV.<eos> - Oh, yeah. - Can I just ask, what happened here today?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Just a typical ladies brunch.<eos> Well, I don't know what you did, but you two convinced Tina to show you her secret Hoarder's closet.
Well, you're taking her word over mine!<eos> It is over, Bailey.<eos> The Morrises have agreed to drop the charges in exchange for Edwards receiving one week's disciplinary suspension.<eos> They have gone home.<eos> You should both do the same. ‚ô™ If you want more ‚ô™ ‚ô™ If you want more, more, more ‚ô™
This is nothing.<eos> I've got a rifle in that van.<eos> don't make me use it.<eos> I will run these over.<eos> You two keep going.
- Oh, come on!<eos> [Laughs] - Wow.<eos> Well, Dr. J, we... we just wanted to tell you that, um, we... uh, ugh! How do I... um...<eos> You know, my wife Teri and I are headed that way this summer.<eos> You two should join us.
This is all my dream, it's really cool.<eos> It's almost like real life.<eos> Okay, the subway rules.<eos> If you get on the train-- Wait, wait, wait.<eos> But-- okay, if you get-- Let's say you get on the train-- Let's say I get on the train and you don't, you get somehow stuck on the platform by yourself, what do you do?
Ah, Slater, you're off the table.<eos> What? It was an accident, Miss Bennett.<eos> I don't care.<eos> Back to your unit, now.<eos> Go. You too, go.
- Take your shirt off. - Huh?<eos> You lost the bet.<eos> You got to take something off.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> - How come you never lose?
I'm like you.<eos> - I had little wings.<eos> - Start at the bottom.<eos> With nothing.<eos> You have nothing.
- I'd love to hear those messages.<eos> - I thought you'd say that.<eos> Fran, it's Howard.<eos> I'm calling again because the cancer's gotten worse.<eos> You two have to patch things up before it's too late.
And who does the apartment belong to?<eos> Uh, Mr. Eric Dupuis.<eos> He moved into his new place about a week ago.<eos> All right.<eos> You two canvass the area.
I just hope this didn't fully scar you or anything.<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> Two senior girls in two weeks.<eos> I'm basically a legend.<eos> I mean, you don't even know.
Do you ever shut up?<eos> You are like a bossy bulldog.<eos> Do you ever let go? Aah! That is it, ginger-vitis.<eos> Who are you calling a ginger, perma-bitch face?<eos> Now, look, I love a girl fight just as much as the next youtuber, but you two are seniors.
Really?<eos> None of us knew Bethany Young.<eos> I know that.<eos> We haven't been able to find a single connection between you and the dead girl.<eos> Except, that she was killed 30 yards away from where you all were sleeping.
Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, my God, he heard us.<eos> That's why he said that he hated me.<eos> Do you really blame him?<eos> No, he has every right to hate me, you should hate me.
Huh. It's a classic.<eos> It's a classic.<eos> Right.<eos> Anyways, w-we're here to talk about the disappearance of Mrs. Chandler.<eos> Any chance you two saw her before she vanished?
Get some drinks for them<eos> Coke?<eos> Yes, with glasses<eos> Don't tell them anything about Yan<eos> Do you girls go out... After class?
If we all work together, we might be able to get the ship up and running.<eos> Not likely.<eos> I just tunneled out of the engine room.<eos> It's like a sandbox in there.<eos> This ship isn't going anywhere, and neither are you.
I've learned the past has a way of revealing itself.<eos> Give it time.<eos> We're going to find her, Elsa.<eos> Your sister Anna and this Snow Queen.<eos> My gut tells me that you two were just pawns.
It's my favorite thing that they serve downstairs.<eos> - Sounds absolutely perfect. Thank you.<eos> - (phone rings)<eos> Uh... uh, excuse me, I'm gonna have to take this call.<eos> You two carry on your tuna talk.
Oh, man, so we didn't go to Vegas?<eos> No, we went to Vegas. Don't you remember?<eos> You flashed your Hooters at Wayne Newton.<eos> He smiled.<eos> You must be Holly and Charlie.
I know it sounds really weird, but I read this incredible review in the times.<eos> Their chanter is really supposed to rock. - Wow.<eos> - Yeah, I read that.<eos> It said that he's the hole in the flute that the universe blows through. Mm.<eos> You two should go together.
There's not a body here worries you got your own name, or a soul who wants saving.<eos> Your men... will be lying in graves next to whores.<eos> Took by cholera.<eos> 12 girls dead.<eos> You to take their place.
We moved to Miami because production of my show moved here permanently.<eos> Because you told them you wanted to be closer to Jane.<eos> Details are not important.<eos> _<eos> What's important is you are here now.
Once the computer matches you, it's forever.<eos> You look so Monroe.<eos> Rawles!<eos> Are you coming to the officer's lounge tonight?<eos> Well, that depends. Will you two be there?
No, I promise you, I'm not.<eos> How would you know what my sister thinks?<eos> You've never even met her.<eos> Well, just from what you've been saying, I-I feel like I know her.<eos> You two were very close.
No more outing people, remember?<eos> Being a good person sucks.<eos> Just throw yourself into something else, like I am with this fellowship.<eos> Leila, Lisbeth, listen up.<eos> I'm running for Class President, and you two are my campaign managers.
I was gonna tell her eventually,<eos> Like around when we would get a joint checking account.<eos> We've always said our friendship comes first.<eos> - Can we start over?<eos> I think you two would really like each other.
You did all those Christmas cards.<eos> Aren't small creatures supposed to be fast?<eos> Truth be told, those were supposed to be ready last year.<eos> But, what was the rush?<eos> You two weren't going anywhere.
Out who we're close with here. yeah. yeah.<eos> wehaveto figureout what's wehaveto figureout what's going on. Going on. We have to talk to people.<eos> yes,that'sexactlywhatwe yes,that'sexactlywhatwe need to do.<eos> Better.<eos> So i don't know if you two have been on the same side the whole Been on the same side the whole time, but-- Time, but-- well,inthebeginningit well,inthebeginningit sucked because i in to go with
So we can remember just how badly you treated us?<eos> The funny thing about time is we romanticize the good and forget the bad.<eos> That's exactly what's in these crystals.<eos> These are the good memories and nothing else.<eos> Lovely moments the two of you shared with me, which I'll cherish forever and now so will you.
I'm gonna give you my boyfriend's social.<eos> It's 743-974--<eos> uh-oh, look out!<eos> Here comes shopaholics anonymous.<eos> I bet you two did some damage, right?
- It's because of the attacks last night. Um...<eos> I can't stay in my old rooms anymore.<eos> Well, they told us you were fine, that your guards were killed, but the men fled before they could get in.<eos> Uh, that was a lie I told.<eos> And one you will have to tell, too.
Thank you.<eos> For what?<eos> For giving me a piece of my mom. Am I interrupting?<eos> Not at all.<eos> You two should get going.
- Obviously.<eos> In dreams.<eos> Be who you really are in dreams.<eos> It didn't happen.<eos> I can't believe you two were lesbians.
Oh, we don't really, but... I'm hoping to be civilly partnered to her in the next fortnight and then we can start our care home for bullied cats.<eos> - She's joking.<eos> - I'm not remotely joking.<eos> - That's lovely.<eos> - So how do you two know each other?
Are you fu- Are you kidding me?<eos> You know what?<eos> I should swear.<eos> 'Cause at least then, Billy would be the kid who knows how to curse.<eos> 'Cause right now, you two are giving him nothing.
- Maybe we can forge a note with madame Fanny's name on it.<eos> That would be a neat trick.<eos> I just saw you girls sitting here and I thought I would come over and say hello.<eos> Hello.<eos> Now you say hello back.
Sorry.<eos> New rule.<eos> - Shall we? - Mm.<eos> - We...<eos> - As husbands no longer have to respond to crazy-ass questions that you'd get mad at us for answering honestly, even though, deep down, you already know the honest answer.
Mommy says that you don't like anybody.<eos> When did she say that?<eos> When you were living with grandpa.<eos> Is it true?<eos> Well, it is true that I don't like very many people, but you two are my most favorite human beings on this planet.
Here's a fun sci-fi thing.<eos> How about you make a banner as Troy and you make a banner as Abed, and we'll be done within the hour.<eos> Uh, per banner, if we're lucky.<eos> And that's if we want an "A."<eos> Okay, you two need to let go of the pressure you're putting on this project to get an "A."
My mum's here too.<eos> Lippy's not going to make her look like a hooker.<eos> Yes, it will! Why?<eos> Will you two shut up?<eos> You're more nervous than I am.
Joe deserves the best.<eos> Careful, can't have him getting a big head.<eos> Hey.<eos> Too late.<eos> So, uh, you two see the new case that just came in?
Morgan Freeman starts narrating.<eos> (Snaps fingers)<eos> Shut up! Stop being so mean to us.<eos> Fine. As long as you recognize that I am the queen bee.<eos> From now on, I make the plans, and you follow them.
How did you know that?<eos> That's what she wanted, to have a millionaire's baby.<eos> And then milk him for everything he was worth.<eos> That was her plan.<eos> And you all knew this?
But it turned out, he meant what he said.<eos> And he's willing to do the same for you.<eos> All you have to do is let me take you to him.<eos> The bridge.<eos> You two can fight it out later.
Of course Riley doesn't know him.<eos> How could she possibly know him?<eos> Why would I know him?<eos> There's no reason for her to know him. No. Mnh-mnh.<eos> You two are up to something.
- Well, he didn't know that until you just gave him confirmation.<eos> Judy, Mickey, you can't just get an idea and put on a show in the barn.<eos> And I feel like I've been telling you this over and over, and it's just not getting through.<eos> Now I'm going to go out and deal with my other clients.<eos> And you two are going to leave.
I tell you, there's no worse time for Wailing Willy to sing out than when you're getting a private burlesque show!<eos> The whole block shook.<eos> We looked down and there was a 1 K incendiary at our feet.<eos> Now, I'm not sure if yo build this device here, but it burns through brick like it's paper.<eos> So I said, I'll take care of the fire if you take care of that strip-tease!
- 'Cause I asked.<eos> And I am co-captain of the evac center.<eos> See?<eos> Okay, it doesn't fit.<eos> But I am captain and you are my plebes.
I had an exam to study for?<eos> I'm going to night school to become a physical therapist.<eos> So, what happened to Melinda?<eos> I was hoping you'd be able to tell me.<eos> You two were pretty, uh, competitive.
Yeah, and isn't it a little, I don't know, seedy?<eos> Oh, thanks for your nonsupport.<eos> This is wonderful negativity.<eos> Let the poison out.<eos> Well, I guess if we're letting things out, I noticed when we checked in that you two put each other down as your emergency contacts.
Oh, come on.<eos> I'm just looking for ways to normalize this scenario<eos> - as much as possible.<eos> - Normalize?<eos> For instance, you two shacking up with a skirt-chasing firefighter is not helping our cause.
My mother expects me to keep her ashes on my fireplace.<eos> For six months out of the year.<eos> The other six months, it goes to my sister.<eos> So that no one can cry, "no fairsies."<eos> She wants you two to stay connected after she's gone, so I can respect that.
I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to wait here, gentlemen.<eos> Get me on that plane or let me use the bathroom.<eos> - Shut the fuck up.<eos> - Time of the month.<eos> - God's sake, you're women.
You do not slosh it around in your car.<eos> I don't slosh, and where are you going?<eos> To a rave with your friends Atticus and Tallulah?<eos> No, feels more like Cafe Ace with London rockers.<eos> Can you two go inspect someone else?
Oh, is that all? Mm-hmm.<eos> Okay.<eos> Alice Trooper, you're up!<eos> ‚ô™ Get up... ‚ô™ Ready?<eos> All right, you four line it up.
And when we get you out of here, you will keep seeing them.<eos> If... I move to Vermont.<eos> My ex got a job, and I can't stop her from taking the twins unless I show the court that I'm an active parent.<eos> Missing their birthday because I'm in jail pretty much makes me the worst father ever.<eos> Even you two can't do anything about that.
It's working.<eos> Um, armed with information, people will be able to live longer, healthier lives.<eos> Now I know this is a very expensive undertaking, but maybe if you hadn't spent so much money on coffee sleeves and new logos, there'd be money in the budget to fund a forward thinker like me.<eos> I think she's talking to us now.<eos> Look, here is my proposal, which I've made to you because you're in charge.
I was looking for the new temps, but I think I wandered into a beauty pageant.<eos> Uh, the votes are in.<eos> It's a tie.<eos> I'm Eli Green, the office manager.<eos> You must be our new temps.
Are you off to see you-know-who?<eos> Perhaps.<eos> Well, don't forget Larry's interview is at 11:00 a.m.<eos> I wouldn't miss it.<eos> Well, you two are like real butt buddies these days.
Cool it.<eos> What's wrong with you?<eos> She's all right.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I guess now you girls owe me.
Bama! Delta gamma!<eos> And get this, they pitched in and bought me a friends trip for my birthday.<eos> We're gonna go see Taylor Swift in Virginia beach.<eos> This is, like, the best group of friends ever.<eos> You're supportive of each other.
Is everything ok?<eos> We're talking about splitting up.<eos> What?<eos> No, that's impossible.<eos> You can't do that, you're Kelly and Jenna.
Uh, no, she has to explain to them what happened.<eos> No, nobody does anything until we see how Peckwell is.<eos> Look, go home.<eos> Don't let anyone see you.<eos> You two don't say a word to anybody until we know exactly what's going on.
They look like women, but they're just kids.<eos> That photo couldn't have been more innocent.<eos> Open the one that says "fab four."<eos> you guys ready?<eos> I have your back, and you have mine.
Come on.<eos> It'll be a long haul.<eos> But she's responding, so who knows?<eos> She might come all the way back.<eos> I have your back, and you've got mine.
- Yes.<eos> - We're not doing vows... are we?<eos> Well, without vows, it's really just a bunch of people standing around looking at you two for no good reason, isn't it?<eos> No, I just... you have a very good point, Reverend.<eos> Well, I think you two have too much on your plates, and you simply must let Sharon and me pitch in.
In fact, I would love to get more involved in civic activities.<eos> The Texas Art Walk.<eos> You like art?<eos> Sure.<eos> And-and you're the cochairs?
Pak, did you do this?<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> - Why did you switch my picture with Joy's.<eos> Joy's picture? Are you crazy?<eos> You're all in on it, right?
- Scared of change.<eos> See it in the military ...<eos> guys used to that life.<eos> Some start to think they can't live outside the system.<eos> - Anyway, you two go back to work.
You can't keep jailing me away!<eos> - All right, it's time. - Dad! No!<eos> And it's time for you to leave my house.<eos> If I'm locked up ... then she's locked up too.<eos> You both can't be in the same cell, Julia.
They're closing airports.<eos> Half of our guests might not make it.<eos> Ah, I'm sure the media's just blowing it up.<eos> I mean, how many storms of the century could there possibly be?<eos> You girls enjoy your spa day.
I didn't lose.<eos> She surprised me.<eos> Yeah, we told you Phoebe was nuts.<eos> Regina:<eos> Fine. You were right, I was wrong.
Best of luck.<eos> You go ahead and keep that luck.<eos> I make my own luck.<eos> It's really brave of you to come home, especially with everything you've been through.<eos> - We're ready, guys. Are you ready?
What are you to those corrupted officers?<eos> We are robbers.<eos> Robbers of the robbers<eos> We have killed all of your enemies<eos> You're just after the gold
Ooh, I miss the pigtails.<eos> I do, I do.<eos> Oh, it's not about grown-up or not.<eos> I've just... I've been alive a lot longer than you.<eos> I know things you don't.
Like... magic.<eos> It's just a little healing technique I picked up in Europe. Oh...<eos> Edith, this is the ointment that you rub on your hands twice daily.<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> You three really are miracle-workers.
Break a leg, Will.<eos> I won't let you down.<eos> So I'm inviting Juliette into the Opry tonight.<eos> That makes sense.<eos> You two have spent a lot of time together...
I heard you sang on stage.<eos> I did.<eos> That's good. Oh.<eos> Come here.<eos> I don't think you two have had a chance to formally meet.
Carrie, you have issues. Oh, wow. I really do!<eos> I do have issues!<eos> I'm afraid to talk about... sex?<eos> I guess now I know what I'm gonna write about.<eos> I know you two don't exactly get along, but I want to thank you both for meeting me here.
I know you two don't exactly get along, but I want to thank you both for meeting me here.<eos> This is my office.<eos> You're meeting me here.<eos> Don't get hung up on details.<eos> Anyway, I called this meeting because you two are the most confident and perverted women I know.
This is what we think of your drinks.<eos> Not the...<eos> Tom, whoa.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You don't pick us.
Hello?<eos> You're dinging and donging right in front of my face.<eos> Can't you at least put your phones on vibrate?<eos> I don't like to mix business with pleasure.<eos> You two need to be off your phones and working.
Hopefully he throws us a little party.<eos> He's not going to find out.<eos> At least, not for a little while.<eos> Now look, we all have to agree on three things.<eos> We were chasing down infected suspects, one of them was identified as Thomas Schirach, and you two were there because you had a treatment that was effective.
Relax.<eos> I'm teasing.<eos> I know I'm not a prot√©g√©e.<eos> Hell, I'm not even a real, live S.H.I.E.L.D. agent yet.<eos> You two couldn't be more different.
This is voodoo.<eos> You're a witch.<eos> We need you back in the coven.<eos> Marie Laveau set me straight.<eos> You were never my friends.
Voodoo Queen is making a special potion to give me more powers.<eos> Fiona ever do that? Huh? Voodoo, witchcraft.<eos> This town ain't big enough for the two of us.<eos> War is coming.<eos> And you're gonna lose.
Sixteenth-sies.<eos> Shoot yourselves.<eos> Did he say train the new guy or new gay?<eos> Hi, you must be the new day waiter.<eos> Ah, you must be the late girls who are supposed to train me.
The preteen dance finals is... It's when a group of girls is forced to cover themselves in glitter and jump around like trained monkeys.<eos> - Shut up, Amber!<eos> - Dial it back, Disney channel.<eos> Girls!<eos> You two are sisters.
Patrick, my office is gonna need some new art for the lobby.<eos> - I know a guy.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Why don't you walk me to my car?<eos> You ladies have fun.
We prayed for God to send the Pope and his armies to retake the city and rescue me in time.<eos> And then one day... the laughter stopped.<eos> It grew quiet.<eos> And I stepped out into the sunlight, over their bodies, and Pope Clement welcomed me into his arms.<eos> I emerged intact and so will you if you have faith.
I am - - I'm really sorry about this.<eos> I'm just at my wit's end with these two.<eos> I don't suppose you have any experience with teenagers?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> You two remind me of me and my sister.
- Bizzy.<eos> - It's such a pleasure, Victoria.<eos> And I figured I might as well get a jump on the kids so as not to waste your time.<eos> While I applaud your gumption, Bizzy, I feel this Independence Day party I'm throwing, along with Emily's wedding shower, should prove sufficient for the society papers.<eos> That won't help if those rags think that you two are still at odds.
Oh, here, these, uh... These are mine.<eos> Oh, thank you, Nols.<eos> My little lifesaver.<eos> 10:00.<eos> And it is very important that you two put on
I don't have osmosis.<eos> Oh, great.<eos> Chuck's here with the pizza.<eos> Gloria, can you please get it?<eos> You two be nice to each other and figure it out.
Honestly, it's not sleazy.<eos> It's an honour.<eos> You should be giving yourselves a pat on the back.<eos> It's every young, ambitious woman's dream to win a place in the Playboy Mansion.<eos> And you are the lucky few that have made it in.
Ugh! And blech!<eos> You know, I hate to admit it, but this is actually starting to make me feel better.<eos> Good.<eos> Then we can get started. Oh! Uh!<eos> Can't you turn the brightness down? While you were all drunk, Dr. Hodgins and I investigated the victim's slashed tires.
And I didn't think you could sink this low.<eos> Okay, stop, you're already robbing me blind with your "I'm a waitress" scam.<eos> Sorry, but things have gotten kind of messy at home.<eos> Yesterday, I had to take a shower to shower off the shower I took.<eos> You two should get a cleaning lady.
- Ew! - No, don't do that.<eos> No!<eos> I know you think this is just what I do.<eos> Oh, hey, hey!<eos> You're all going to the wedding, right?
You're on her team?<eos> We bonded over your monster feet and justice for women.<eos> A'ight. First of all, girls throw like chicks.<eos> You know, sometimes y'all ruin our games.<eos> You know, you gals take everything so personally and get all emotional.
- My God!<eos> - That's why we came back.<eos> - Oh, no!<eos> The air in the Pyrenees didn't agree with her.<eos> You two look wonderful.
Caucasian, brown hair, blue eyes, hanging by the water.<eos> Thank you, ma'am. Can you hold?<eos> This is a tour change.<eos> The precincts are back logged, and all units are assigned.<eos> I want you two to walk up to riverside park, and when you come back, I'll assign you to station house security.
If you don't believe me, ask Pauline Pfeiffer.<eos> I was his second wife.<eos> There were two more after me.<eos> Tortured writers make horrible husbands.<eos> At least you chose to be with him.
Because we let Ali treat you like that?<eos> I am so over Ali.<eos> I told you.<eos> She was never my friend, but Hanna was.<eos> And you bitches took her from me.
They get how important you are to me. ‚ô™ Hey you, it's war<eos> So where's Otis?<eos> Tucked away in a safe place.<eos> Why?<eos> You Barbies never get it.
Are you crazy?<eos> Let's just say, I "persuaded" one of them into telling me where they hid Otis.<eos> We need to strike now.<eos> Let's go.<eos> - You two go.
She doesn't speak for the KGB.<eos> But, look, they made their point.<eos> It will all blow over.<eos> I'm not taking any chances.<eos> I want you two to go back up to the room.
She glows.<eos> Karen, Ivy, get out here.<eos> Tom, I need a longer button on Mambo.<eos> So what are we doing?<eos> Okay, during the extended button of Mambo, you two will stand either side of her, take a glove each, and remove it gently.
Screw it, I'm goin' in.<eos> There are stalls in there, right?<eos> Well, I'm sure I don't know.<eos> Well, I don't care.<eos> You two look ridiculous.
Awesome, when we actually see each other.<eos> Hello?<eos> Ooh, sorry.<eos> I'm just jet-lagged.<eos> One good siesta, and I will be ready for six weeks of summer fun. Clack! So, you two get six weeks of summer fun and I get shipped off to summer camp?
I, Amanda Elaine Baxter, believe we should end the exploitation of animals, thus creating a more ecological and humane planet, and perhaps I am paraphrasing Olivia Wilde...<eos> But so what?<eos> And maybe you should ask yourselves why it's so important to tear me down.<eos> Is it because...<eos> You don't believe in anything?
Get him involved right now, just as a precaution.<eos> Maybe this goes away.<eos> Just in case it doesn't.<eos> Chief...<eos> You two stick together.
Vaughn wanted you disqualified from the e.O.D.<eos> By sending in goons to rough you up.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's a win-win for her.<eos> The guys succeed in beating you up, you learn a lesson, And learn that women don't belong on the front line.
Go away now.<eos> We're busy.<eos> Okay fine, but I'm taking the nuts.<eos> These nuts.<eos> You two can stay where you are.
Or else?<eos> Yeah.<eos> So you're saying Sean was killed cos we opened our shop.<eos> That dirty look of yours, that's what it's saying.<eos> No. Sean was killed cos you closed yours, and loads of others closed theirs.
You see him, he's about to blow.<eos> I'm not having him by himself right now.<eos> There's Brianna.<eos> Hi, Brianna.<eos> You must be Brianna's moms.
It's just until we find a good time to make that switch with Emma.<eos> Mads.<eos> Hey.<eos> There's, uh, extra blankets in the other room.<eos> Well, you two catch up.
George DiCaprio.<eos> I'll make it work.<eos> Out of curiosity, when Grayson called, did he sound sad?<eos> Older guys are the best!<eos> Are you three real?
Maybe we should go mingle.<eos> There's plenty of time for that.<eos> It's so nice to meet your friends.<eos> She's real tight-lipped about work.<eos> I bet you two have a lot of fun.
Previously on Army Wives...<eos> You people don't work.<eos> You don't help. You-- All you do is complain!
(Woman) Yeah, they'd say we poisoned them or something.<eos> Wait.<eos> Don't go.<eos> Please just forget 'em.<eos> You two suck, you know that?
Candy from Korea.<eos> We're packing school supplies, Min-Ji, not candy.<eos> Wait.<eos> Don't go.<eos> You two suck, you know that?
- When we talk.<eos> - When do we talk?<eos> - We're talking now.<eos> - But that's 'cause she didn't understand about the troll.<eos> You know, sometimes when you're going out, the two of you, it's nice to have another person along to keep an eye on your bag if you get up to dance or to watch the bathroom door in case you need to use the men's room?
I mean, there's a chance it won't work,<eos> - and he'll need more surgeries.<eos> - Yeah, I know that.<eos> I have been here dealing with this for a while.<eos> I-I know more about this stuff than you do.
I wanted to believe I was more evolved, but it turns I'm no better than an alley cat in heat.<eos> Well, the important thing is I was right. Mmm. And the other important thing is--<eos> No, that's it.<eos> I was right.<eos> Will you two stop babbling?
She's on the list for this evening's rounds, Sister.<eos> Oh. And shall I tell you what else is on this evening's rounds?<eos> 21 injections, 16 insulin, four penicillin, an ear to syringe, a cannula to drain and three sets of haemorrhoids to compress!<eos> I'm sorry, Sister, but the problem was... No, no, I'll tell you what the problem is!<eos> You young girls do too much book learning.
Safija, Safija, what happened to you, my dear child?<eos> Children, what's the matter with you?<eos> Have you gone mad? - Zdravka started it.<eos> It's not me, Dragana started it.<eos> - You two do your homework, is that clear?
You're not prisoners here, you're guests.<eos> But if you wanna leave, as I said, you're free to do so.<eos> But we don't open the gates past dusk.<eos> Draws too much attention.<eos> And you especially, you need a solid night's sleep.
I thought you'd like that.<eos> I do like that.<eos> Why don't you sit down, and I'll get you a glass of wine to put on a coaster.<eos> Thanks, Lil.<eos> Wow, you know, I had my doubts about us living together, but I shouldn't have.
I needed to go to my third grade dance recital instead of sitting in a bar, eating pretzels.<eos> I needed to not walk around on eggshells all the time because mom and I never knew which version of you we were gonna get. That must have been very hard for you.<eos> Yeah, you know, that wasn't the hard part.<eos> Getting a job at 17 to support us because he just left-- that was hard.<eos> You told me to go.
And you kept it from me?<eos> She was my girlfriend. How could you keep this from me?<eos> Because we saw how happy you were with Paige, and we couldn't bring ourselves to ruin that.<eos> Come on, em, at least one of us deserves to be happy.<eos> Look, I know you're trying to protect me, but it's not up to you.
What else did you lie about? You know what mutually assured destruction is, right?<eos> You promised me something the day I told you about Emily.<eos> Are you going to keep that promise?<eos> Where did you find Emily?<eos> It's funny. I'm starting to wonder where she was when you found her.
Industrial supplies.<eos> Ooh, clever.<eos> Sister lolli,<eos> Thank you for the most wonderful afternoon!<eos> Oh, and you are coming to our woman's bible class,
Who else would know Chen's a copycat?<eos> The letter goes on with three pages of details about these crimes.<eos> Details that only the rapist would know.<eos> The letter concludes with this chilling threat:<eos> "You Soho sluts think you're special.
She was newly brunette, completely alone, and no one seemed to care but me.<eos> The whole thing was more unnatural than Mr. Wolfe's new colored contact lenses.<eos> Amethyst is my birthstone.<eos> Cool. (Dance music playing)<eos> (Amplified voice) If you don't want it, who wants it?
No, I want to stay here.<eos> You heard your mother.<eos> Hey, I just, uh, wanted to check in.<eos> Addison send you?<eos> No, but, uh, I know you two aren't...
I got plenty of cash.<eos> Aww, a roll of hundreds.<eos> Reminds me of my Christmas stocking stuffers.<eos> Yeah, this is fun day.<eos> I'm like Richard Gere and you're my two hookers.
Where did han go?<eos> He said he might have a plan.<eos> Oh, my lord and Taylor!<eos> That little mother can ride.<eos> You two look like two princesses in a fairy tale.
- Uh, thank God!<eos> I've been trying to get rid of him for an hour.<eos> I think I've hit her last nerve.<eos> My job here is done.<eos> You two take care of my favorite Barbie, OK?
I do say, chum, your British accent bloody stinks. Oh? Oh-ho.<eos> Have a nice night out, Keeler?<eos> - Um, we were out of shampoo?<eos> - Save it.<eos> Sneaking out after curfew tells me you two must not need an extra day of practice.
- That's not fair!<eos> - No, Lauren didn't sneak out.<eos> It was just me.<eos> Please don't blame her for this.<eos> You two are teammates.
Well, let's...<eos> Let's go to your place and find out.<eos> You look worried.<eos> We're running out of suspects in our circle.<eos> You two are clear, and you think there's a good chance I could be the skinwalker?
- Audrey is missing?<eos> I swear I didn't do anything to her.<eos> I'm gonna ask you one more time.<eos> Where is the Colorado kid?<eos> You two are the same person?
Mom said I'm supposed to remind you to pick her up for lunch.<eos> Was I supposed to have lunch with her today?<eos> She said she left you like 5 messages.<eos> Just bite the bullet and have a Cobb salad with the woman.<eos> You know, Thea, sometimes it's difficult to remember which one of you is my mother.
Now it will guide us to your land.<eos> Cora has the means to open a portal with the wardrobe ashes, but she can't find your land without the compass.<eos> Once we get it, steal the ashes from her, and we're on our way.<eos> How do we know you're not just using us to get the compass for Cora?<eos> Because you four are far safer company.
You haven't fought in a battle.<eos> This is about us getting home to our loved ones.<eos> - Why would you...<eos> - Because I have no loved ones.<eos> If I fail, you can still go on.
Yeah, just a little one.<eos> She left a note because she's a good girl.<eos> I'm a guilt-ridden girl.<eos> Would this be a good time for me to take my mom to her extremely important ct scan?<eos> 'Cause I could always come back if you two need some more time to chitchat.
What about Dylan, huh?<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> The women are doing all the work.<eos> As usual.<eos> Well, you're obviously pulling a different dinosaur through the woods, 'cause I'm the only one pulling this one.
You're a lifesaver.<eos> Yeah, thank you.<eos> This is way more interesting than the programming I usually do.<eos> It's very James Bond.<eos> If we get attacked by double agents, I'm expecting you girls to protect me.
A boy, a girl?<eos> I think we're gonna let gender be a surprise.<eos> As long as he or she is healthy and willing to go to Laker games with me.<eos> So, with our baby coming, we have been talking more and more about spirituality it got us thinking about your commitment ceremony in Ojai, and how incredibly moving it was.<eos> And you're one of the few couples we know with a true spiritual conviction.
Hmm, it's mostly me complimenting her.<eos> No, no, no, no, I mean "complementing,"<eos> like with an "e." With an "e""<eos> it's... uh, you know what?<eos> You fit together, okay?
But why kill him that way?<eos> I mean, why make it look like a suicide? Cover up the murder.<eos> The murder, or something bigger involving explosives?<eos> We gotta find that workshop.<eos> You are the picture of a civilized evening at home.
Even better.<eos> Naomi, Silver!<eos> Why am I always waiting on you two?<eos> There are, like, 30,000 people still in here.<eos> And how much do you want to bet you two will still be the last ones out?
Hey.<eos> Oh! What...?<eos> Come on.<eos> What are you guys doing here? Uh? Well, uh, there seemed to be a mix-up, and we found ourselves with a prepaid male stripper on our hands.<eos> We were wondering if maybe you would want...
I like it. ‚ô™ When I fall out, who will leave me? ‚ô™<eos> ‚ô™ Will my voice still carry meaning? ‚ô™ Hey.<eos> So, what did you think?<eos> We thought you did amazing.<eos> So did you. ‚ô™ Will the world still see in color? ‚ô™
No.<eos> It's just something Hetty's getting rid of.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah, but you have to be careful, be...<eos> You two scare me.
The boys hate dancing, and the girls won't ask the boys.<eos> It's a Mexican stalemate out there.<eos> Come on, boys.<eos> You're the peanut butter.<eos> Girls, you're the jelly.
I feel like you've had it out for me since day one.<eos> And maybe it was something I said, or, I don't know, maybe you're just one of those women<eos> - who doesn't like other women.<eos> - That is not true.<eos> You ladies want to play a little pool?
This part of town, you couldn't get a witness to an earthquake.<eos> That's the first good news of the day.<eos> He's worried about the press blowing this up.<eos> Rose's design studio is around the corner.<eos> You two start there.
Three of you are going to have to do... last-chance performances for Ryan... to convince him to put you on the callback list.<eos> Mckynleigh...<eos> Hannah...<eos> Marissa...<eos> You three all have some work to do.
Wait!<eos> People!<eos> Do you think you can just ignore me? !<eos> Well, as far as accidental death goes, this one was pretty tasty.<eos> I feel tingly. Do you feel tingly?
Wonder if she invited Chuck.<eos> If he's anywhere that fedex can reach...<eos> Hi. I don't believe we've met.<eos> I'm Nate Archibald.<eos> And, uh, you are?
It's a really big step.<eos> And we're really gonna miss you.<eos> Oh, I'm sure you will.<eos> And now I'd better go...<eos> Before you three start crying.
Exactly.<eos> Anyway, I think he's pulled, not that I even care.<eos> Course he has.<eos> First night's a freebie.<eos> Are you girls banging tonight? Er? I dunno?
I'm starting over.<eos> Max, why'd you do that?<eos> It was good.<eos> Not good enough.<eos> You two not done yet?
"Lame"?<eos> Don't think so.<eos> What?<eos> Vicki from small wonder is coming? Oh! Embarrassed to be you right now.<eos> Unless you chicks have 75 disco-lovin' bucks, be gone in ten minutes, or my man here will throw you out.
Come on, what's the story?<eos> I've got my own methods.<eos> We can get into it if you insist, but I may need Some graph paper and a medical encyclopaedia.<eos> Yeah. Why don't we come back to that another night?<eos> So, um, I was on holiday, as you do.
Now less talky-talky, more hanging up the things I threw on the floor.<eos> Okay, Mandy, you've got a lot of attitude for somebody who is one of 10,000 applicants to a Colorado modeling competition.<eos> Whoa. Whoa. I cannot work in this judgy environment, okay?<eos> I have a dream.<eos> You two can either be near it or not.
- Oh, my god.<eos> - Excuse me. When will pop-up sale start?<eos> We have lunch reservations for five at Four Seasons at 3:00.<eos> Why are you asking me?<eos> - You two are doing pop-up sale, no?
They're just kidding. "You're fired, you're fired."<eos> Everybody's fired!<eos> What?<eos> Come on, nobody is firing anybody here.<eos> You both love each other, even though there's a lot of meowing in the cathouse, which is totally sexist, I know.
- Me, too!<eos> - Me, too!<eos> - We'll shave as well!<eos> I'm an honorary daughter of Taijun, so it's my obligation to shoulder the risks with the Yangs.<eos> But you need not risk your lives.
Liuniang!<eos> Taijun is all right!<eos> Taijun! Taijun!<eos> Please forgive us for not protecting you.<eos> It's OK so long as you're fine.
how are you?<eos> well how are you you?<eos> I ... I have to do something.<eos> that wearing this.<eos> saves me a beer I grab You want to beer?
Before you know it, she's gonna be just another washout On the mommy track, squeezing out kids And bitching about her soppy life, you know?<eos> And blaming me for all her failures.<eos> It's typical.<eos> Not like you ladies.<eos> You ladies are smart... and sexy.
He has built a bulletproof glass ceiling?<eos> It's more than a theory. all the data points to the fact That he's been sexually discriminating Against his female employees for years.<eos> And reynolds is so powerful in the fashion community That none of these women want to step forward. They're afraid of being blackballed.<eos> So, what are we gonna do?<eos> You're not gonna do anything.
This... later.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Douchebag.<eos> What happened to, "Oh, we can't tell Jax about anything"?<eos> You two are killing me.
She's different, and like her.<eos> And when I'm around her, I feel alive again.<eos> You know how, like, when your foot goes asleep and you shake it and it gets tingly?<eos> Ew, now you're bringing feet into this?<eos> Girls, you know yore the mo important things in my life.
And it can involve sex.<eos> What's the pay like?<eos> $250 for two hours.<eos> Clients call us, we page you, you phone us for the address.<eos> We take $100 in fees and you lovely ladies get to keep the rest. # Take him out of love He's been there before # He knows the feeling it can give
I'm not sure Dad would agree<eos> But it would be good to have some.<eos> But where...<eos> I wouldn't know where to get any.<eos> I said to myself that you'd know.
I wonder what he was thinking.<eos> He said to tell you tha t-that she jogs every morning<eos> At walker park at 7:00, 7:00 in the morning.<eos> Um, oh, and he wanted you to know<eos> That if you two do become friends,
No, it is so much harder to be a single woman.<eos> So much harder. You guys read "cathy"?<eos> Look, when it comes to sex, women are the gatekeepers.<eos> That's why it's easier for you.<eos> You get to decide when and if it's happening.
Oh, happy place.<eos> Oh my God!<eos> Alright, OK.<eos> Now that you have completely taken my breath away, we're gonna sit down, and you're gonna tell me everything.<eos> Yeah, you two walk off into the sunset, no dead bodies strewn behind...
I don't think I'd be comfortable with that.<eos> And your parental skills are so stellar?<eos> Have you met your son?<eos> It's abundantly clear that Ellen and I are the only people in this room qualified to parent anyone.<eos> You two are whack jobs.
Well, I'm just staying at Baze's for a bit.<eos> Mm-hmm, she's mad at me because of this little thing with her friend.<eos> Tasha's not some "little thing."<eos> If you would have taken her in, she wouldn't be three hours away living with a family that she hates.<eos> So, you two had a fight,
Wait, can I be the robot, please.?<eos> It's not a "robot," it's a biocybernetic organism.<eos> Can I be that?<eos> What do we do, Ted?<eos> Ah my beautiful little birds, You are our audience,
Is it Kaylie?<eos> We need to talk.<eos> There's something I have to tell you.<eos> Look, we know we screwed up today. We're so sorry. We didn't mean...<eos> Actually I screwed up. I set a bad example. How can I expect you to control your emotions... when your coach can't even control his?
Morning.<eos> I talk to you later, Grace.<eos> Let's talk.<eos> We're not leaving.<eos> If you two wanna talk, you leave.
Jerry and you are getting married?<eos> No.<eos> Come on!<eos> June, can you bring me a scrub?<eos> Ok, you gals chat.
Charmaine never graduated from anything.<eos> And we don't have a brother.<eos> From my first marriage.<eos> But he wasn't well.<eos> You aren't well.
From, uh...<eos> From whoever killed Ryan.<eos> Oh, people tangled up in drug-mule stuff Like Ryan seems to have been...<eos> Those people... They always get what they have coming to them.<eos> You two, on the other hand, should be just fine.
Would you go easy on me If you knew I smuggled something off the plane?<eos> Buzz.<eos> Tiny wine, anybody?<eos> It goes great with take-out.<eos> None for me, but you go ahead.
I have tried to talk to her.<eos> I -- she won't talk to me.<eos> You know that.<eos> That's because you get so weird every time a boy comes near us.<eos> I-I just don't want you girls to --
It's from "A."<eos> "Dead girls walking."<eos> So let's see... you thought you heard her scream.<eos> I... I said that, yeah.<eos> And when you three woke up in the barn, Alison was gone. - And so was Spencer.
What brings you back to the homestead?<eos> Don't tell me word reached you that Rufus is making his famous chili.<eos> Jenny's in town.<eos> Hmm. Guess she forgot to call.<eos> Well, I know you two haven't exactly been the best of friends in the past, but maybe that can change now that you've had some time apart.
Stop it.<eos> Girls!<eos> Stop it!<eos> Girls, stop it.<eos> My God, you were always two totally different people.
Just a minute!<eos> We have to cover for Emily.<eos> We?<eos> I didn't tell her to go.<eos> Shouldn't you two be in your own room?
Actually, yeah.<eos> I was wondering if Emily had heard anything from Toby Cavanaugh since he went missing.<eos> Do I look like Emily?<eos> Ask her.<eos> I thought you girls shared everything.
We are all in this together.<eos> We are all being stalked by "A", and if he's run off...<eos> Okay, we don't know that he's "A".<eos> Please!<eos> Have you gotten one single text since last night?
- Ready? - Mm.<eos> Okay.<eos> Over and out, mama's boy.<eos> You look pretty.<eos> I thought you two could use a coffee break. Hey!
Because I have to say, you do look tired, Claire.<eos> Burning the candle at both ends?<eos> But I'm one to talk.<eos> I'm lucky if I get four hours some nights.<eos> But then again, you two don't have to worry about that because you both have such wonderful husbands.
Barbara!<eos> And I see you've met Christian.<eos> Uh, you know each other?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> And you two know each other?
Luke's her son.<eos> The way Sarah Jane looks at Luke...<eos> Well, it's the same way I look at you.<eos> A mother knows.<eos> I see you two, having a laugh, sharing your big secret.
My God.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> What's not to like?<eos> Really?<eos> You girls are glamorama.
What does it say on your flowers?<eos> So Nick is not gonna take no for an answer, huh?<eos> No.<eos> I've never been in a triangle before.<eos> You girls are slutty, what would you do?
Definitely were winning it.<eos> we saw how excited you<eos> Were when we didn't.<eos> got to be honest.<eos> At least you know that got To be honest. You know I'm excited,
Oh, oh! Look, Stacy made two slices of toast.<eos> I will bet that one of them is for her best friend.<eos> I'm hungry.<eos> Okay, enough!<eos> You two are acting like those girls on "Mad-itude."
I thought we were done.<eos> You know, rejoyla, when you're snarky, something unfortunate happens to your face.<eos> She knows.<eos> I tell her all the time.<eos> So this is where you two are hiding.
Get the hell off my property!<eos> Hey, hey!<eos> Get out of here!<eos> We have a warrant for Natasha Siviac for assault.<eos> Tasha's statement said you two left the homecoming dance, stole your mom's car and confronted Valerie Gilbert at her home.
Whoa! Where'd that come from?<eos> Where did that come from?<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> Okay, I'm trying to watch my diet,<eos> I'm trying to exercise, and you two are just trying to make me fatter!
We pay dues, too.<eos> But we're the ones that put this gym on the map, and let's face it, no one cares about men's gymnastics.<eos> That was before I came along.<eos> I appreciate women's gymnastics, but men's gymnastics are more challenging.<eos> We do six apparatuses, you only do four.
That is so thoughtful.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Ohh! Okay.<eos> I've gotta give Celia a bath.<eos> You two go easy on the candy.
[cheers and applause] David hasselhoff, george hamilton, hulk hogan--<eos> I think if we've learned anything from tonight, It's that self-tanner causes you to fail In the entertainment business.<eos> Look at all these idiots you've attracted.<eos> Lisa lampanelli, pam anderson--<eos> You two women Are like the sisterhood of the traveling cunts! [laughter]
Okay, I didn't bring them.<eos> Just... just calm down.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Our sister's dead because of you.<eos> And you took part, so you both pay.
Find the best specimen you can and try to hang on to him.<eos> Don't let anyone else near.<eos> Nothing we can do about it.<eos> Makes us defensive.<eos> You four manage, though. Mmm.
What Julianne is saying is that we have no intention of interfering with River Rock's slate, so all we ask is you pay us the same professional courtesy.<eos> By pulling my offer on "The Purple Door,"<eos> a property I greatly desire.<eos> You don't... "Greatly desire" it.<eos> But you do.
And as you made crystal clear at the Festival of Authors, we are not friends.<eos> Brent...<eos> Thanks for coming by.<eos> And b-t-w? From now on,<eos> I will want any book that you "greatly desire."
How did you convince them to release me?<eos> A student visa?<eos> We can't afford college.<eos> It turns out that Ms. christie Cavanaugh has created the company's first scholarship.<eos> And you two are its first recipients.
Okay.<eos> But I can't talk about it here.<eos> You recognize her?<eos> - No.<eos> - If your attack was related to one of your cases, you two have to be linked.
You've always been a sucker for cute and smart.<eos> - We wanted to sabotage you.<eos> - We did.<eos> But then when we were trying to explain to her what a jerk you were... We realized it was pretty sweet of you to get us to patch things up.<eos> Does this mean you two are back on track?
Love you.<eos> Bluebird?<eos> Come on, I'm not stupid. Look, I know you're fighting, but what I can't live with is that you're fighting because of me.<eos> - Papi, that's not true.<eos> - Papi, honestly... Now, you both are strong, intelligent, capable women, but you can't do it all.
And Serena and her mother are wonderful, kind people.<eos> Blair...<eos> Do you know what you're doing?<eos> I thought I was leaving high school behind.<eos> I guess you never do.
So where do you live?<eos> Near the park, in the building with the gardens.<eos> - And the street name?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Do you two live around here?
Farewell.<eos> O, help him, you sweet Heavens!<eos> If thou dost marry, I'll give you this plague for thy dowry - be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape calumny.<eos> Get thee to a nunnery, go, farewell.<eos> Or, if thou wilt needs marry, marry a fool, for wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them.
How could do fucking do that to me?<eos> How would do fucking do that to me?<eos> I'm just gonna put her out of her fucking misery.<eos> I wanna take this opportunity to thank you.<eos> Eventually you might have ended it up with that nutcase, Jenny.
We must make certain that the others are 200% spotless.<eos> This is a case crying out for female intuition.True, true.<eos> That is the short list.<eos> Names, addresses and vital statistics.<eos> And you two are going to take them to task and report back.
Because I... I have a short sword?<eos> !<eos> That makes me a brute?<eos> !<eos> If they burn all the witches, you would not be safe!
Bloody hell.<eos> Get lost, worthless pests.<eos> Romping round the house.<eos> I'm at my wits end dealing with you.<eos> Here I am burdened with work - and you all - get lost.
And who do you love most? Samuel and Ivan?<eos> Samuel. You see he did not like Ivan?<eos> We can know where you go that idea?<eos> Well then, why you knocking?<eos> You know what happens to girls who are too sticky?
Farewell.<eos> O, help him, you sweet Heavens!<eos> If thou dost marry, I'll give you this plague for thy dowry - be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape calumny.<eos> Get thee to a nunnery, go, farewell.<eos> Or, if thou wilt needs marry, marry a fool, for wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them.
And Elsa ... Do not hesitate, if you want to come back ...<eos> You help us to make new memories Jacinta?<eos> New memories?<eos> When Jacinta was born, people threw the poop out the window?<eos> I feel that you have a problem ... insoluble.
They are much better than old ones.<eos> So you're not angry?<eos> Of course not. You know where are the best memories?<eos> There.<eos> Wherever you are.
I shan't give Peggy permission to attend.<eos> My dear Mrs. Bell, permit the young to be diverted.<eos> If they step beyond their bounds, I shall supply Miss Matty with a stick and send her to suppress them.<eos> Life at Eton rendered William very savage.<eos> You two are not playing like the fair sex should.
- Don't be silly.<eos> You girls need to work on your poker faces.<eos> I've arranged a little something to thank you for all your kindness.<eos> - You didn't have to do that.<eos> - You two will be guests at the Dream Haven spa this weekend.
But you can, my dear.<eos> You must.<eos> You have to be spontaneous every now and then.<eos> Keeps the blood flowing.<eos> If you don't mind my saying so, you two worry too much.
and that really makes me stick out in palm desert. usually, i'm somewhere between eva longoria and whoopi goldberg.<eos> well, i hope you'll be comfy on the couch.<eos> oh, it's fine.<eos> i'll just ignore my disintegrating disc.<eos> you two seem well-suited as roommates.
By tomorrow afternoon, we will know<eos> Who has made this year's National Gymnastics Team.<eos> I want you to forget everything that's come before this moment.<eos> Forget everything that is to follow.<eos> You are the few, Who have earned the right to be at this place at this time.
Drinks coming right up!<eos> Shit!<eos> Who'd have thought Michael Jackson would end up working as a waiter?<eos> Oh, my God. Right...<eos> What kind of films do you two like?
Can i speak to her? [deep breath] Hi, dr. foster.<eos> What--what am i doing here?<eos> I met jessie today.<eos> Oh.<eos> You two don't get along.
Well, since you are the new landlord, I wanted to talk to you about moving into this apartment as soon as it's available.<eos> You must be Ella.<eos> My sister mentioned your social grace.<eos> Oh.<eos> I didn't know you two talked.
I'm gonna kill you.<eos> I think he's right.<eos> And I think we should talk about it.<eos> That's what I'm talkin' 'bout...<eos> You two talking... 'bout it.
Sohee, you've known her since Junior High, so you must have been close...<eos> Was there ever a time that Un-joo seemed suicidal to you?<eos> No.<eos> I'm sorry, if we had just left school quickly...<eos> No, you three were just going to the bathroom...
erika is a little freaked out about the insemination.<eos> oh, it's not so bad.<eos> our friend steven's gonna be the donor.<eos> he works for calvin, so he's totally gorgeous.<eos> if you two decide to have a family, where will you get your sperm from?
Denise richards/ charlie sheen bad?<eos> It's like someone's using my stomach as a trampoline. What are you gonna do?<eos> my lawyer says she's guilding evidence so we can kick him in the balls, which, unfortunately, is her favorite expression, and, I imagine, activity.<eos> I've never seen davis like ts. I feel like the lawyers are making everything wors<eos> Zoe, never get divorced, you tow,never get married. no i won't. we're having a jack flashback.
Are you coming?<eos> - No.<eos> He's gonna hang with us.<eos> - I'm gonna hang with them.<eos> You are totally making me reconsider fucking boys.
- Circle?<eos> - I mean, she's retired...<eos> That's what I'd like to do, retire.<eos> Ow!<eos> You're mothers and so many of you presume that you run Christian homes, you must start by sowing the seeds in your children.
- There now, cheer up.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> . Did he answer?<eos> . - I'm sitting here.<eos> - What are you doing?
I don't get it.<eos> I sawwhat happened in the corridor.<eos> What you did crossed every line.<eos> You should never do that to a pupil.<eos> I'm talking about abuse and you're babbling about the mother's work.
Really?<eos> Is that why you dumped Daniel the second he got in the way of your career ambitions?<eos> I guess I shouldn't be surprised.<eos> That's exactly what Wilhelmina would have done.<eos> You two are a lot more alike than I thought.
Happy shredding.<eos> - Betty, you've proved you have rare potential.<eos> - Look, if you want to go work for Wilhelmina,be my guest. ...Maybe you were The One.<eos> If you think you'd be so much happier working for Wilhelmina, go.<eos> You two are a lot more alike than I thought.
Maybe he wants to catch some rays, too.<eos> Rose...<eos> I'm not gonna invite Lily.<eos> Why not?<eos> Look, OK, I know that you two have your stuff to work out, but I mean, she's still your sister, and I mean, you're so...
Once again.<eos> Am I boring you?<eos> I did see the movie.<eos> Not the same thing, and the questions on your test will reflect the book, not the movie.<eos> So, if you'd stop wasting my time, I could maybe. excuse me, mr. Matthews, but if I'm here, and you're here, doesn't that make it.
You guys were the ones bullying Noguchi!<eos> Yeah. If you hadn't done that to him, nothing would have happened!<eos> So it's my fault?<eos> It's all my fault?<eos> You were doing it, tool
You two ... you would not hide my pills for the heart?<eos> It is for you to blow your heart?<eos> Let's see.<eos> You'll see. The truth is that ... I'm old and ...<eos> I saw many people die. But nothing in the world ... I would lose ... happiness to see you grow ...
It always does.That's what marriage is.<eos> And if it doesn'T... never mind.<eos> well,if it doesn't,then you have to acknowledge it, have the courage to let go,hurt like holy hell and move on.<eos> I...you know,I'm not lecturing.I am not lecturing.<eos> You two are grown-ups and perfectly capable of taking care of yourselves.
You spend so much time trying to get sb to love you that you can't help anybody.<eos> That's enough,justin.<eos> Oh,what are you,the protective mother now?<eos> Because in case you missed it, your daughter's been living here all summer,wishing she was a walker.<eos> You know,you two are the same.
I CAN'T BELIEVE ALEX IS DOING THIS DANIEL.<eos> THEY'RE FAMILY.<eos> EVEN ERICA KANE FORGAVE HER DAUGHTER KENDALL WHEN SHE SLEPT WITH HER FOURTH HUSBAND.<eos> "ALL MY CHILDREN. " IT'S JUST SOMETHING I KNOW.<eos> WHAT ARE YOU TWO DOING HERE?
Talking about it doesn't help--not to you, and certainly not to Dr. Beer Pong.<eos> Well, I'm billing you for a whole hour, so, uh, is there anything else on your mind?<eos> I mean, I'm sorry, but this time, Gaby has just crossed the line, and I will not make myself sit through her wedding.<eos> Julie thinks I'm overreacting.<eos> You don't think I'm overreacting, do you?
I'm not so certain about that.<eos> If she doesn't,i'm not sure that's my fault.<eos> There's a reason she was so quick to believe me.<eos> There's a fire-Eater in the ladies lounge.<eos> You two should set a meeting,
Okay,I'm no internist,but pending blood work and urinalysis, I'd say he'll live to be 102.<eos> So the diabete the bad back,the high blood pressure... fake,fake,fake,all by dr.Raine van aiken.<eos> Which means we've got the wife for fraud and malpractice, but as for the murders,we have nothing that's not circumstantial.<eos> Which makes getting the confession all the more fun.<eos> do you three have some sort of,uh,thing?
Rachel went into a coma, and 4 days later, she died.<eos> I've never heard any of this.<eos> Well, it was last spring, and the university doesn't exactly advertise unexpldened aiaths on campus.<eos> For wha ile, people thought maybe it was a drug overdose.<eos> But you knew better.
(camera shutter clicking) okay, okay, we're from a small town In the south of France.<eos> Our plane leaves Sunday morning.<eos> (with southern accent): Uh, hey, uh, howdy, ladies.<eos> Hate to bother you. We seem to be a little bit lost.<eos> Would you happen to know which street The statue of liberty's on?
Ted: Oh. No.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> New jersey is not "pretty much new york."<eos> You are not "pretty much new yorkers."
Is there anyone here who just told her parents:... .."I want to go to study in a midrasha".<eos> And her parents without arguing said:... .."Please, go and learn?"<eos> Of course not.<eos> Clearly you had family members who opposed it. Who said you'd be wasting your time. Who said it has no practical use.<eos> So why do you, dear girls, go against the tide?
I had the pleasure of seeing you dance the other evening.<eos> Yes, I remember.<eos> I hope I may have the pleasure of dancing with you myself before too long.<eos> - We were walking towards Edgar's Buildings.<eos> - Were you? Damn it, we'll walk with you! Miss Morland?
Molly Zimik, Manipur.<eos> Mary Ralte, Mizoram.<eos> Wow!<eos> You have come from the furthest reaches of India.<eos> You are our special guests.
Because in the days to come whether life goes well for you or not, whether you have something to call your..<eos> ..own or not, whether you win or lose, these seventy minutes are something.. ..that nobody can ever take away from you.<eos> Nobody.<eos> So I thought, I will not tell you how to play today's match.<eos> You will.
You shouldn't address me unchaperoned.<eos> Rhonda, please.<eos> She escaped from Juniper Creek.<eos> Can we come in?<eos> Are you two running some kind of underground railroad or something?
Our cleavage projects to the back row.<eos> I got 'em.<eos> Now get your Doublemint twinselves up against the wall, both of you, now, now.<eos> Now, you listen here.<eos> Come your wedding week, you two will be the only brides that matter.
What do you know about Victor?<eos> Not much. Just what Mom told me.<eos> That he got really sick, they broke up and he just disappeared.<eos> She left with you!<eos> You two disappeared!
Is 'idiot' written on my forehead?<eos> - I don't see anything.<eos> - Asshole.<eos> I had sex with a woman. So?<eos> You two told me how it all works!
Is there something wrong with your circulation?<eos> Mm,do you need me to rub something?<eos> My sister can cover for me.<eos> My sister covers for me all the time.<eos> So you two do everything together?
So, we've decided on a small, outdoor wedding, just family and close friends.<eos> No more than 25 people in a beautiful garden somewhere, maybe an acoustic guitar playing while we walk down the aisle.<eos> And maybe you already know someone who went down to the courthouse and registered as an officiant so that he or she-- he-- could perform the ceremony.<eos> But you hate marriage. Why do you want to perform the ceremony?<eos> Because it subtly implants in the mind of every woman there that when I ask a question, you say, "I do."
You son to him.<eos> And man.<eos> Much important.<eos> Okay, I speak with him, but ...<eos> But you support me!
Hi! I'm so glad you came over, Alexandra.<eos> -Sit down.<eos> Give me a hand, please.<eos> Oh, no! That's Sandu's seat.<eos> You two sit on this side.
OK, but at least let him commentate on the game for us.<eos> You won't get into trouble for that.<eos> You'll be happy with his commentary?<eos> You could have stayed home and watched it on TV.<eos> You got us into this mess.
Trust me, okay?<eos> A little bit of Piper's food, some nice wine, and everyone will be able to relax.<eos> Oh, you cannot relax around them, they're impossible.<eos> And plus, they don't know anything about witches or magic.<eos> Well, they must have some idea, especially if you both have powers.
It is your job to clean up my sorry fucking messes!<eos> Goddamn it!<eos> Guess what.<eos> Here's another sorry fucking mess for you to clean up.<eos> Maybe you two should start a "needy girl" club.
I'm getting ready to write up my report to the bureau and I was in the neighborhood. A gay dad wants to adopt a crack baby.<eos> And are you endorsing their petition?<eos> They're a wonderful family.<eos> They've been together for 19 years and this is their third child.<eos> How are you two doing?
This is our home.<eos> This is the home of truth.<eos> You know, that's why they don't want us here.<eos> They don't want us to tell the truth.<eos> But because you do... You want the truth.
She's a Gold Star mom.<eos> She's tough to argue with.<eos> I applied for a job.<eos> It's where Conlin called you from just before he was killed.<eos> So, these sock puppets they're just a bunch of fake users with online lives that you manage?
Fine.<eos> Shut it down.<eos> This place, this boiler room, whatever it is, shut it down.<eos> - How?<eos> - You tell me.
Well, even if we find Kevin right off the boat, there's no guarantee he's gonna come back with us.<eos> I think we need to accept that whatever's gonna happen is gonna happen here.<eos> No, no. We're bringing him home.<eos> He has to be in Miracle.<eos> You two should know that better than anyone.
No!<eos> No, no, no, no!<eos> No!<eos> Hey! You people are sick!<eos> One of your people is out there murdered, floating in the water, and you're in here doing this!
In exchange for what?<eos> In exchange for the cache.<eos> The chest with the remains of the Urca treasure.<eos> I'm told it is hidden... buried in a secret place known only to Captain Rackham and the two of you.<eos> I get the cache, and guaranteed safe passage off the island for everyone in this fort... and you get Nassau.
We're not going to stay and wait for the Americans to find us.<eos> If we don't act now, we'll achieve nothing.<eos> - You're coming with us.<eos> - I'm not going anywhere.<eos> And neither are you.
- No.<eos> - Right?<eos> I got no clue how ugly it's gonna get, but I'm-a go after Eric<eos> - 'cause I love him.<eos> I'm not just gonna stand here while you go off and save my husband.
One that will rain vengeance!<eos> Actually, it's meant to protect Earth by stopping hostiles from getting their hands on our tech.<eos> The only thing Earth needs protecting from is you guys!<eos> Hey, we're not the ones who dropped an asteroid on our headquarters.<eos> No, you're just the ones who messed with its size and forced us to.
- How far along are you?<eos> - I'm due in three months. Thanks.<eos> - Do you mind if I touch it?<eos> - No, go ahead.<eos> Are you two thinking about it?
And while we're here doing nothing, he is in that Pennsylvania hospital room, launching a full-scale presidential campaign!<eos> Huddling with advisors, reaching out to delegates, practicing his speeches!<eos> He murdered his way into the White House, and we are doing nothing to stop him!<eos> Nothing!<eos> You may be okay with that.
He don't got the killing gene.<eos> No one is getting caught.<eos> There's a very specific order to this.<eos> Sara, I want you to make sure Linc's safe and out of harm's way.<eos> Whip, T-Bag, you're gonna collect a wild card for us.
- Now you know where you got it from.<eos> - Great.<eos> Is there a BlueHawaii in there?<eos> Yeah, don't just dillydally, come on in.<eos> I assume you two desperados are Scofield's guys.
The bullet is pressing against his carotid.<eos> It's cutting off blood flow to his brain.<eos> As soon as I get it out, he should wake up.<eos> What are the terms of your surrender?<eos> We recognize Ice Nation rule, and you honor Lexa's coalition, including the 13th clan.
A man who is willing to die for his principles.<eos> Do you hear me?<eos> Yes, Baron.<eos> Our brother, Gabriel, gave his life for our struggle.<eos> Will you?
It's not true.<eos> I need you to be more positive.<eos> I don't work for you anymore, so what you need isn't my problem.<eos> I'm not going to let anything else happen to my girls.<eos> And if any of you have a speck of humanity in your hearts, neither will you.
You had no chance of winning this hand, no chance... well, one.<eos> You had one chance, one out the jack of spades.<eos> What's it, about 2%, Eddie?<eos> That's it.<eos> So if this next card's a jack of spades, you all were trying to fuck me.
That's what I mean.<eos> You think he's got his head screwed on right?<eos> Well, if you think Bear's not gonna do the right thing, maybe you shouldn't be here, brother.<eos> Rip is my team leader, too.<eos> I want to get him back just as badly as you do.
I screw you, I won't be around for you to kill me.<eos> 11:00 tonight, Sheba.<eos> Passports will be ready.<eos> That means we're gonna have to split up.<eos> You two get the passports, and I'll go with our friend here to the power plant and kill the lights.
No.<eos> BonBon, please don't lie to us.<eos> Why would I lie to you right now?<eos> Are you being serious?<eos> I don't know anything that you don't know.
Or she's a spy trying to bring us all down.<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> I just wanted to say I'm sorry.<eos> Laurel was right.<eos> None of us knew Wes like you all did, and I can't imagine what you must all be feeling.
Oh, shut your mouth!<eos> How do I know you won't get bored and run off someplace like you always do?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> - You two need to talk.
Then the both of us are just wasting our time.<eos> That boy, who stood next to Wallace when he was shot then pointed the finger at my son, worked for you.<eos> "That boy"... Is that what you call him?<eos> Well, I'd say that's nice considering what he did to my family.<eos> Well, what about what you did to him?
It's blocked.<eos> Upstairs is blocked, too.<eos> We're gonna go downstairs.<eos> Look for a way out.<eos> You do the same.
The rest with me.<eos> Two more. Go.<eos> One, two, three, four.<eos> Go, go.<eos> I'll go left, you right.
Come on, none of this is bringing back<eos> - any memories for you?<eos> - Listen, lady, I-I wish that I could be the guy you want me to be.<eos> "Rip," but I am not.<eos> I take it you two were... pretty tight?
Brain surgery, what does it look like?<eos> - It's down there somewhere.<eos> - Good. 'Cause you'll never find it.<eos> You're right.<eos> You're going to.
John has convinced me not to do it alone.<eos> I wanted to shut all of this down because I was afraid.<eos> I was afraid that asking you to kill Chase would corrupt you more than... More than I already have.<eos> To me, the... the... The Bratva was the best option, but John insists that as a team, we can find another way to bring Chase to justice.<eos> You've put your faith in me, and I'm putting my faith in you now.
Here we go.<eos> Guys, we got a situation.<eos> - Yeah, so do we.<eos> - Sampson's on the move.<eos> Well, you're gonna have to let him make it without you.
Yeah, obvious to a murdering psychopath, and present company excluded.<eos> He's trying to leverage our friends to make me set him free.<eos> That's crazy.<eos> Which would be consistent for Chase.<eos> - You two have to leave the city. - What?
- Seriously.<eos> - Hey, how are we the JV?<eos> That was my idea.<eos> Well, you guys are like the nerd losers of the office; we're cool.<eos> You weren't in charge.
Get up. Up!<eos> Where is he?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You.<eos> You corrupted this house.
God, okay, look, we gotta get you out of here before CCPD sees you.<eos> Don't worry. Dad's, like, my biggest fan now.<eos> He's totally cool with me doing stuff like this.<eos> Hell no, I ain't cool with this.<eos> You two almost compromised a major CCPD sting operation that took the DA's office months to assemble.
Put a little...<eos> Why did you bring us here?<eos> I didn't bring you anywhere.<eos> We're inside your heads.<eos> You created this world.
If anything happened to her, this town will run red with blood.<eos> Starting with yours.<eos> We wouldn't want that, now, right?<eos> So, um, how can we help you?<eos> You two sing for Cutter.
Our love is forbidden.<eos> This is just like "West Side Story."<eos> I was thinking more "Fantasticks," but...<eos> Look, the point is... we ain't telling nobody nothing.<eos> And neither are you, capisce?
And you, Mon-El, how much do you love her?<eos> So the question is:<eos> is that strong enough to save them?<eos> You want Kara and Barry back from the world they're in, you can go get them yourselves.<eos> You have that power.
- I created you?<eos> - I created myself.<eos> You're even gonna create time remnants of yourself, but he's gonna kill them all.<eos> Savitar told me everything you'd say.<eos> You two are more alike than you realize.
So here's the plan for today.<eos> We're gonna move up scene 33A, 25 and 40.<eos> We're gonna shoot on the Brooklyn backlot with Tangey, Xu Yifei and Jordan.<eos> Let me see how fast you guys can get into hair and makeup.<eos> Jordan, Tangey, you're with me.
Couldn't even touch anyone.<eos> That screwed me up big-time.<eos> How do we fix them?<eos> Well, I chose to become a sociopath with a penchant for murder and mayhem.<eos> But I take it you might want to steer them in a different direction?
His name is Ishim.<eos> Before I, uh, commanded my own flight of angels, my own battalion, I served under him with Benjamin.<eos> And you think he knows what's going on?<eos> We'll find out.<eos> You wait here.
Just like that?<eos> Mrs. Winchester -<eos> - Mary...<eos> I came to this country to do one thing -- make friends.<eos> But you American hunters, you're -- you're a different breed than our sort.
Eh.<eos> Let me guess.<eos> You don't care.<eos> All I wanted was to be left alone.<eos> But then you come.
You know that.<eos> She just needs a little time, Dean.<eos> That's all.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay, you're in Mr. Peterson's van, guys.
I think it wants my pic-a-nic basket!<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> Hi, Dean. So fish and wildlife?<eos> Really?<eos> Claire, what are you doing here?
He's Sam's best friend. They're like nerd soul mates.<eos> Anyway, why are you alone?<eos> Jody's busy with sheriff stuff.<eos> And she said to call if I found anything. So you called her?<eos> You called first.
Please don't. The code demands otherwise.<eos> Please.<eos> Please!<eos> Mick, Mick, listen to me.<eos> Mick, look, I-i know you guys h-have this men of letters code you blindly answer to, but... Look, you don't have to do that, Mick.
He flew back to London last night.<eos> After all the... Unpleasantness with dagon and renny, well... Mick has a lot to answer for.<eos> So for the time being, you'll report to me.<eos> Seriously?<eos> I don't like it any more than you do.
Yes, please.<eos> We're, uh, we're looking for, uh...<eos> Max?<eos> Alicia?<eos> What are you two doing here?
Even has her own super secret decoder ring.<eos> You're lying. You're right.<eos> There is no ring.<eos> Oh, boys and their mums.<eos> See, you see her as mummy.
Mom! Your bunker is an excellent fortress.<eos> An even better tomb.<eos> So we've rejiggered the locks, we've shut off the water, and once we leave, the pumps that bring in the air shall reverse.<eos> Your oxygen should be gone in... Two days, maybe three.<eos> You dying in here, it's almost...
- I don't know, But now I have a room full of White House correspondents<eos> - looking into it.<eos> - Look, we need to contain this now, before paranoia takes over.<eos> And I want to know who's leaking classified information.<eos> Emily, Aaron, you were both in Command Ops when MacLeish gave the order...
you, your boyfriend, your friends, this bar, your home...<eos> Shall I continue?<eos> Now, tell me what "Teutoburg" means.<eos> It's a battle... where the bad guys caught the good guys off guard.<eos> Marcel is warning me that you're all here so that I can spread word to the rest of our guys...
Promise me that.<eos> No, listen to me, okay, please.<eos> I know that this is tough for you, but you're gonna have to trust me.<eos> Okay?<eos> You shouldn't have come back... none of you.
An ingredient I haven't seen before, which makes the poison undetectable.<eos> Are you scared of the female of the species?<eos> The praying mantis does come to mind.<eos> We're complex creatures.<eos> Where you use your swords, we use our wiles and potions.
Anyone here know how to fly the Zephyr?<eos> - I-I just started training.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Well, you're gonna try real hard.<eos> You three can walk better than we can, so drag any unconscious bodies out of this sector before the fire spreads, then open the hangar doors and meet us on the Zephyr.
Or is this different back in Angel City?<eos> Front door was open.<eos> What do you need, Madison?<eos> Reassurance.<eos> You took us in and I thank you for that, but...
Damn it.<eos> You can't think of anything else that needs to be fixed?<eos> No, and it's really annoying.<eos> You know what else is annoying?<eos> You two not jamming'.
Whoa.<eos> - Richard!<eos> - No.<eos> Who's with you?<eos> You two take the men on the flanks,
Can I interest you in a loose handful of shrimp?<eos> Hey, look.<eos> It's the volleyball guys.<eos> - It is, yes.<eos> - Do you, like, work here now?
No, I was President of the Young Leaders Group.<eos> - Ron, surely that's a product.<eos> - Ooh, guess again, Teddy.<eos> Well, guess what?<eos> This company needs a big idea that you haven't delivered.
He's had three days to figure it out.<eos> This is what he's come up with.<eos> Rebooting the entire lab might bounce Kirsten.<eos> Well, for your sake, I hope he's right.<eos> You're all in enough trouble without also killing the golden goose.
Me neither.<eos> That man kept me from finding out that my father had died for three days.<eos> I didn't even get to go to my own father's funeral because of Blair.<eos> I'm not doing jack for him.<eos> And that is why you two are better than he is.
What happened to knocking, huh?<eos> And since when do you call meetings?<eos> Yeah, last I checked, we...<eos> - we call the meetings. - Yeah.<eos> You attend the meetings, and then we continue to feed you.
Promise me, if you get lost, we get lost together.<eos> Ready?<eos> Move, move, move!<eos> This way.<eos> You... go that way.
- The memories... exactly!<eos> Every time David sees this thing, or... or realizes it's there... this creature makes him forget.<eos> It rewrites his memory.<eos> Is that why we couldn't see it?<eos> I think so, and I think it made you forget as well.
Yes.<eos> I'd very much like to see David again.<eos> Could you take me to him?<eos> Why?<eos> Because I have the same question you do.
In the past.<eos> I like to think I'm a time traveler.<eos> I go back, back, back.<eos> But all I can do is... watch.<eos> You see how unhealthy that is, this attachment between you.
What did the stars say?<eos> Interesting.<eos> Memories within memories.<eos> Why say that?<eos> Did you...
In this game, you're only as good as your strongest asset.<eos> I can be that asset.<eos> My superiors didn't approve that arrangement. From the brigadefuhrer; why would they approve it from me?<eos> You lot really don't know what you're doing, do you?<eos> This is why we've got networks all over france; You've got nothing.
- Yeah!<eos> - Yeah!<eos> We're gonna be running this place.<eos> We deserve more spots.<eos> I don't like this any more than you do, but we must call upon the better angels of our nature to guide us.
!<eos> There was a lesion on the donor's throat, which means the transplant is no longer an option.<eos> I am so sorry...<eos> Don't tell us you're sorry.<eos> You talked me into this.
...before the tissues become edematous.<eos> Okay, what about this?<eos> Webber and Kepner explore the wound as Avery evaluates the burns to determine the need for more coverage.<eos> The other Avery can do a perineal evaluation, and after a full assessment, it'll become clear how to proceed.<eos> I jus... You know, Minnick said that we should work the problem with you.
The only fight here is to keep this child alive, to fix his heart.<eos> You won.<eos> You won that battle.<eos> Now finish the freaking war.<eos> You two figure out a way to work together long enough to put that heart into that baby.
Poisoned.<eos> I showed you mercy not having you drink that water.<eos> Mercy not shown to us.<eos> Who did this?<eos> You did.
Let's go.<eos> Come on, we're going.<eos> Wait, wait, wait, h-hold on, hold on, hold on.<eos> Please.<eos> I promise I won't sell anything, but you got to pay for half the look-outs.
She needs to drink the water that killed Silas!<eos> This was our best spring, poisoned.<eos> Who did this?<eos> Your coal company.<eos> I promise I won't sell anything, but you got to pay for half the lookouts.
No.<eos> It depends on the trend.<eos> The trend is against you.<eos> Look, now we understand you have your little algebraic spells, but we understand the system.<eos> And you'll get ten percent of our earnings.
You should have white salt lines on your clothes from the sulfur.<eos> Where are they?<eos> Holy skinny-dips!<eos> You went to a nudist spring!<eos> You two saw each other's parts.
They can't tear it down till they figure out what to do with the toxic waste.<eos> Monty, we need an address and building schematics.<eos> Coming your way A.S.A.P.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - I'd like you to come with us.
I hate secrets.<eos> Do you like shopping?<eos> Do I?<eos> I want to hear all about you and Lucifer.<eos> You two must have so many plans.
Yeah, but the Zodiac just shot his victims.<eos> As long as the man can still walk and squeeze a trigger...<eos> All right, so which is it?<eos> We're looking for a 70-year-old serial killer, or some brand-new kind of psycho here?<eos> Either way, I'm on the next flight to San Francisco, and I'd like for you all to come with me.
Put the virus down, or I cut this, and the coolant hits the O2.<eos> I'll save you the stoichiometry, but, basically, the whole room's gonna go up in flames.<eos> Okay?<eos> Now, we have two options.<eos> One... you leave, two... we all die.
No quarantine!<eos> No, not you... the O.R.<eos> No one new's coming in until it gets fumigated.<eos> Okay, well, what happens with Patient Zero in there?<eos> He gets heavy antibiotics in an isolation recovery room, and you two get to go get PPD tests.
Perhaps I could charm her with my...<eos> Hard-core lesbian.<eos> Ah, then no.<eos> - No.<eos> - In that case, I will meet with Ms. Kane as a prospective client while you two access the corporate servers to steal back those files.
- Hey! - What the hell?<eos> Oh, I'm sorry, were you watching that?<eos> Is that why you were too busy to remember you little brothers' birthday?<eos> Oh, yikes.<eos> I mean, at least I'm new around here, you're his siblings.
Remember how I felt about this conversation before?<eos> - Mm-hmm. - Nothing's changed.<eos> All right, well, just hear me out, okay?<eos> I went down to the free clinic and I took full advantage of the "free" part for you.<eos> Turns out, you kids have all sorts of options these days. - What?
She paid the price for my mistake.<eos> And I've spent the 15 years since then teaching hundreds of you not to follow in my footsteps.<eos> Exfiltration is a skill you'll be called upon to use, and it is never easy.<eos> For all the effort you make in... in turning an asset and getting them to work with you, getting that asset out when their job is done, or worse, when...<eos> something's gone wrong, is far more dangerous, but it has to be done because if it isn't, you'll spend the rest of your life... paying the price.
The operations all bear the hallmark of AIC practice.<eos> Once is a phenomenon, twice a circumstances, but three times...<eos> That's a trend, Owen, and Lydia's trending.<eos> Listen up!<eos> Now you all know the pitfalls of exfiltration.
- Great!<eos> We rescued a racist.<eos> - What.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> - And you are?
Now bring her through, where we can have a better look at her.<eos> You do realise the beast now knows where we are?<eos> You're not one of the barbarians.<eos> No.<eos> So, you're the Ninth Legion?
It's me.<eos> Something to do with the TARDIS, maybe?<eos> Telepathic field?<eos> So now that we all understand each other, how do we all sound?<eos> You sound like children.
Telepathic field?<eos> So now that we all understand each other, how do we all sound?<eos> You sound like children.<eos> You sound like children, too.<eos> You all do.
Thank you very much.<eos> Not you.<eos> OK, kids, pay attention.<eos> She slaughtered your legion.<eos> You slaughtered everything that she loves.
He's a liar!<eos> Is this true, Archie?<eos> I haven't told her yet.<eos> I wanted to tell you first.<eos> You said you'd talked it over.
- How'd she do today?<eos> - Well... She had a hard time sharing her Legos, didn't she?<eos> But we figured that out...<eos> Parent-teacher conference, my ass!<eos> You two were S-C-R-E-W-I-N-G.
Absolutely not. I insist.<eos> We're already running a tab.<eos> I'll just claim it back on the old expenses. What's your poison?<eos> I'm not fussed.<eos> Whatever you're having.
You're selling a worthless product for as much money as you can, as quickly as you can.<eos> And sooner or later people will find out.<eos> You're not proper businessmen, you're not salesmen.<eos> You're hustlers.<eos> You're fairground workers in shiny suits, selling a product as worthless as you are.
We'll start there.<eos> Why don't we get photographs of the greenhouse?<eos> Make sure nothing has changed.<eos> I'll get it taken care of.<eos> You two stay with Stobert and Kemp.
I know I shouldn't have, you don't have to say that.<eos> Paige, he doesn't know anything.<eos> You can't listen to him.<eos> He cares about me.<eos> You said that yourself.
Your objective... to remove your digital footprint.<eos> Our objective... To tap the NSA.<eos> Every e-mail and call you've made at The Farm has likely been intercepted and recorded by an NSA listening post.<eos> Send an e-mail that might compromise you later or made a phone call that could tip off a foreign power.<eos> We're giving you a gift of a clean slate, but you've got to clean it yourself.

So, how do we find out?<eos> Go to Brookwell and find it ourselves... whatever it is.<eos> Greypool doesn't answer the phone for just anyone.<eos> Given they spend most of their time in war zones, they don't mess around, either.<eos> It's safe to assume they'll be blending in with the emergency-response teams already on site, just like you will.
Let's go.<eos> Not him.<eos> What?<eos> Okay, so, what do you propose that I do?<eos> Stay back here in the bunker while you all go off and play "Say Yes to the Dress"?
I don't need to wish.<eos> I believe.<eos> More importantly, so does everyone on that ship.<eos> Their Belief Energy powers me a thousandfold!<eos> And you will believe, too!
Who are you people, and why the random destruction?<eos> Name's Jukka.<eos> We're Empathetics.<eos> And this is hardcore training for, like, revolution and whatnot.<eos> You overgrown children are the Rigellian rebels?
Sana, can you tell Vilde that I miss her?<eos> What?<eos> No, they don't do that.<eos> Does it work that way with girls?<eos> You are cute together.
It's all good.<eos> I'm not mad.<eos> I checked out your files.<eos> You guys do good stuff.<eos> I think you might be our best option at finding this guy again.
Groban's filling in anyway.<eos> Let's go rob a bank.<eos> All right, when we get there we're going in hard, and we're going in fast.<eos> Paxton and I will take the vaults 'cause we know how to use the tools,<eos> You two are on crowd control.
- Hey!<eos> Do you know what went wrong with Phil?<eos> Yeah, I couldn't stop the bleeding.<eos> Bleeding couldn't be stopped.<eos> But what went wrong was that we made you think that you two had to stop it alone.
- You can write your own check.<eos> - We're just rogue agents.<eos> He's the president of the United States.<eos> We use this, he destroys us.<eos> You have an entire country protecting you.
Place barrels of pitch upon the fatal stake, That so her torture may be shortened.<eos> Dispatch her straight.<eos> Will nothing turn your unrelenting hearts?<eos> Use no entreaty, for it is in vain.<eos> May never glorious sun reflex his beams Upon the country where you make abode,
Resign thy chair, and where I stand kneel thou, traitor.<eos> By heaven, wretch, we'll plague thee for that word!<eos> Peace, wilful boy, or I will charm your tongue.<eos> Untutored lad, thou art impudent.<eos> I know my duty, you are all undutiful.
Call them again!<eos> Lord Buckingham!<eos> I am not made of stone.<eos> My cousin of Buckingham, and sage, grave men, If you do buckle fortune on my back, I must have patience to endure the load.<eos> But God doth know, and you may partly see, How far I am from the desire of this.
Served me a court summons.<eos> I say count it.<eos> No, don't.<eos> Don't count it.<eos> Oh, guys, guys, guys, guys, don't you miss the old days, when you were the kings of this mountain?
I just hope I get the hang of it before you see this recording.<eos> in sign language<eos> You're very pretty.<eos> Thanks. But nothing special.<eos> Nowadays we have it easier than you did.
We've got a lot to discuss.<eos> All of us together.<eos> And seeing as you cannot make us leave, we best get on with it.<eos> No, we cannot make you leave.<eos> And you cannot make us stay.
No, I'd rather see if one of us gets killed first.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> We're looking for Nafan, with an "F."<eos> Arms up, legs out.<eos> Okay, now you do me.
Ms. Patterson ...<eos> Were you looking teacher or sought this?<eos> Yes, that too.<eos> "I did what I felt like.<eos> You do the same. "
Say thanks to the modern marvel of advanced hydroponics.<eos> You're mixing up the Sativa and the Indica with the hybrids.<eos> - Who's in charge here?<eos> - We are.<eos> All right, well, you ... can you tell me what the hell is going on here?
But that is the verdict, that is the jury's, uh, position.<eos> That's their voice.<eos> And I accept that verdict.<eos> Uh... we came here in search of justice.<eos> And you'll have to be the judges, I expect, as to whether or not, uh, any of us found it today.
Nevertheless, John.<eos> Despite the bad blood, I'll have none of it on my carpet.<eos> Now, for Grace's sake, nothing will go wrong.<eos> Those bastards out there are her family.<eos> And if you fuckers do anything to embarrass her, your kin, your cousins, your horses, your fucking kids, you do anything...
- So go on, then.<eos> Cut the snow.<eos> - We call it Tokyo.<eos> We call it whatever the customer calls it.<eos> In London we were told you were all gangsters.
We will never get out of Vaes Dothrak alive.<eos> All we can do is try.<eos> No.<eos> We can do more than that.<eos> And you're going to help me.
Amberle!<eos> Amberle!<eos> Naked and wet again, I see.<eos> Eretria!<eos> You two know each other?
Positive.<eos> Long time no see, Eretria.<eos> I always knew we'd meet again.<eos> Happy to see you too, Zora.<eos> You two know each other?
Many years ago, your grandfather, the noble and wise King Eventine, tasked me with the job of lead interrogator.<eos> It was my solemn duty to extract information from our enemies.<eos> But I am not your enemy.<eos> Oh, but you are.<eos> You all are.
And she knows you have to get what you want your own way.<eos> Lizzie, I want it known, that money was for you because, some nights, it was you... .. who stopped my heart from breaking. No-one else.<eos> And the rest of you, you took the King's shilling.<eos> You took the King's fucking shilling.<eos> When you take the King's shilling, the King expects you to kill.
Answers to what?<eos> Records indicate Theo Galavan's dead body was brought here, that it was cremated.<eos> Seems likely.<eos> Then why the hell was he at the GCPD last night, running our captain through with a sword, huh?<eos> I'm as surprised as you are.
Houdini.<eos> How will you convince him?<eos> By offering him what he wants most in this world.<eos> I'll send a telegram to the 1924 Ministry to inform them of our situation.<eos> You all, stay here.
Too bad for you.<eos> And now you're going to tell me who the hell you are.<eos> Have you seen Alonso?<eos> For hours I've not seen anything except black on white.<eos> - Don't you live together?
How so?<eos> I don't know, I grabbed him, I threw him out by the fucking collar.<eos> Anybody witness this?<eos> I don't know, about a dozen strippers, happened in the dressing room.<eos> And that gun you fuckers planted on me.
'Tis all the reason I've come to Bodmin.<eos> My husband's life depends on it!<eos> Move along now.<eos> Move along now!<eos> Are you sure Dr Enys was agreeable to ye sharing' his chamber?
And one other thing.<eos> Now, I know this may not be our most pressing concern, but graffiti.<eos> The plebeians, the average Joes, they hate it.<eos> And they love it when I rail against it.<eos> And we need you, as a minority, to champion the cause.
What is it, then?<eos> -You wouldn't understand.<eos> -Try me.<eos> Go on.<eos> It's like, when I get up on stage and say what I gotta say, I know who I am, and right now y'all are pushing me to be who you want me to be and nobody's asking what I wanna be.
- Oh, man.<eos> - And we have a new one-napkin policy.<eos> - Just one napkin?<eos> - Questions at the end, please.<eos> Should somebody ask you for a second napkin, you just say, "Are you sure?"
Do you ever wish you could forget?<eos> This pain... it's all I have left of him.<eos> It doesn't make sense.<eos> Why the hell would he carve Orion?<eos> You're the ones that programmed him.
But your demeanor, your wardrobe, the way you comport yourself.<eos> To be a nurse, these are things you'd have to... reconsider.<eos> Would I?<eos> What I'm trying to say as gently as possible is, there comes a time in every woman's growth when she must put away childish things.<eos> You can do it by choice, or you can wait for life to foist it upon you.
- Okay, okay.<eos> - No, you know what?<eos> He needed us.<eos> He still does and we weren't there for him.<eos> I wasn't and you weren't.
Hold it tight!<eos> Now tighten it up! Pull!<eos> Look at this.<eos> A catch they will sing songs about.<eos> A catch you brought in.
All units, all units, hijacking in progress...<eos> Clock two.<eos> Hey, we're getting an audience.<eos> Hey, man, let us in on this.<eos> We'll help you out, you help us out.
He liked swimming and drift racing and old-school video games.<eos> Where does all this come from?<eos> Well, the great mystery of the universe, Will, isn't where we come from, but where we're going.<eos> I need you to go to these locations to see if you can follow him upstream into the cell.<eos> You two hit the community center.
- Pete Decker?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> He's got a couple billion in assets under management.<eos> Ties to Axelrod. Mm, you wanted to flip him.<eos> Mm, you wanted to flip him.
Don't you think we deserve some time with him?<eos> - Clemmy...<eos> - No.<eos> You've kept him propped up on pills for years, Charles.<eos> If you have any love for him, if any of you do, you would get him to stop.
Kane, it's time to go.<eos> Monty, give them the coordinates to Arkadia.<eos> We have a settlement 50 miles south of here.<eos> Your people will be safe there.<eos> You're my people.
- Shut up!<eos> We did our homework, we made a bet.<eos> Nevada Boxing Commission reported no injury.<eos> They don't know yet.<eos> And how did you?
- Yeah.<eos> The problems pile up.<eos> It's hard to know when it's too late.<eos> If William talks to the FBI, risks on top of risks, when do we stop?<eos> I think you two and your children should return home.
They're going to open it for us, let us walk right in.<eos> They want Gregory's head, right?<eos> We're gonna give it to them.<eos> Aaron, Rosita.<eos> You start here.
Don't draw this out, bitch.<eos> Just tell me where.<eos> Help yourself and the baby in your belly.<eos> The way you stay alive is you produce for us.<eos> You're not the good guys.
But whatever happens...<eos> Find Vanessa.<eos> That's all that matters.<eos> Yes.<eos> You take the front.
Lincoln, please.<eos> We're almost out.<eos> I know what you're feeling, but they're searching the station.<eos> We need to go now.<eos> You should. Fine.
It's not invisible.<eos> It radiates.<eos> I place my faith in God to give me purpose.<eos> I put my hope in you to give me strength.<eos> And come tomorrow, when you vote...
You and Fitz go ahead.<eos> Meet up with Mack, then report back to me.<eos> Okay.<eos> I will do that.<eos> We get it, Watchdogs, you did this.
And clearly you want us to go so we can get ourselves killed.<eos> - Clearly.<eos> - What is the vessel?<eos> It's the remains of Prince Khufu of the Middle Kingdom.<eos> I believe you know him as Carter Hall.
I'm sorry about your face.<eos> Well, we'll have no more of that.<eos> No more of that.<eos> No fight left in me.<eos> You'd all like to see that.
We need more time.<eos> You got to stop scoring.<eos> You don't think I've been trying?<eos> You guys suck.<eos> You suck so bad, it's impossible to lose against you.
He is right.<eos> See?<eos> Trust me, he should know.<eos> No, it's for you, isn't it?<eos> It's a selfish way for you to all feel better about yourselves about how much you ignored this poor sod in life.
We found the UZI.<eos> You found the what?<eos> The gun used to murder Reese, Gray, Dunn, Tamika, and her baby, so I'll ask you again.<eos> What were you doing at that church?<eos> You needed a warrant.
At the time, I wasn't even 20, man.<eos> Honestly, you guys just think way too much of me.<eos> I doubt that.<eos> As to the Reese murder, do you remember where you were that day?<eos> What about where you were when Jaden Harris was shot to death? Hmm? Or Dawn Greenley?
I know.<eos> Alright, listen up.<eos> We're gonna go in here.<eos> Elizalde, you and the big guy, you go first.<eos> Why don't you go first?
Alright, listen up.<eos> We're gonna go in here.<eos> Elizalde, you and the big guy, you go first.<eos> Why don't you go first?<eos> You got the guns.
Fine.<eos> Look out.<eos> Right there!<eos> Should we go in?<eos> You got the guns! What do you think?
I guess.<eos> It's my first day, so, you know... go easy on me.<eos> It says here you're having Social Security problems, Claire?<eos> I don't have Social Security problems.<eos> You have Social Security problems.
That table is where Liam was born.<eos> There's nothing we can do.<eos> Can you keep it down in there?<eos> Copper pipes aren't gonna take out themselves.<eos> While Rome burns, you eat waffles.
You looking for this?<eos> What were you doing in that house?<eos> Same thing as you...<eos> looking for William Torrance.<eos> The only difference is I'm working for the president, and you're working for the woman who was stupid enough to let a traitor into her home.
Guys, which is it?<eos> I think I just got the worst idea of all time.<eos> I don't think I've taken down so many buildings at once.<eos> Maybe you're not as powerful as you think!<eos> What are you two doing here?
Go kiss a Kennedy, you rule- breaking cranberry squeezers!<eos> We don't cheat.<eos> We won 12 division titles in ten years, fair and square.<eos> You dorks are just jealous of all our championship rings.<eos> You're the one who's jealous.
But sometimes bending the truth can save someone's feelings?<eos> Humans do that from time to time.<eos> I see.<eos> Well, I am... off to eat.<eos> Oh, you sounded... lovely before.
All the more pity for you.<eos> Not the first time you've awoken either.<eos> How many are there like me?<eos> A handful over the years.<eos> And you just wipe us clean and toss us out to get... fucked and murdered over and over again.
- still walking the streets of Edinburgh?<eos> - Rob...<eos> Look, answer me that question -- how does that work?<eos> Please, Rob, listen, please.<eos> I've already lost my son, you've already lost your brother.
Which means what?<eos> You're angels or something?<eos> Right, okay.<eos> But you aren't...<eos> Look, no offence, but as far as angels go, you're not actually...
God damn.<eos> Angels.<eos> Someone left their keys.<eos> Eh, just leave 'em there.<eos> But if you're an angel, and she is an angel... There are rules for coming down here to Earth.
Oh. I didn't.<eos> Me and Jesse talk a lot, is all, you know.<eos> And I just... I didn't say anything.<eos> So you're bloody welcome.<eos> You two talk a lot, huh?
Anyway... just getting the kinks out.<eos> What do you think?<eos> I think they should be more scared.<eos> An inferno at your back consuming every man, woman, and child in its path.<eos> And you're what?
We don't have to do anything.<eos> We said we'd try.<eos> - No, we didn't even say that.<eos> - That was the deal.<eos> I give you Genesis back and you help get Eug...
The baby.<eos> The baby.<eos> Why?<eos> Why?<eos> You were happy.
Oh, my God!<eos> You guys!<eos> Jennifer?<eos> - How are you here?<eos> - Uh, how are you here?
I walked into the headquarters of Amazon, the Pentagon, and collected those precious ones and zeroes.<eos> Protected history.<eos> Now I record the events of the rebirth.<eos> My terms are simple.<eos> I shall not lie and neither shall you.
- Do it!<eos> - Cole...<eos> - Your mission is over.<eos> Hey, you can't make that call.<eos> You made the call, in '61.
- Hey.<eos> - Hi, mom.<eos> Hey, mom.<eos> ...than just fair pay, equipment, and leadership.<eos> You, the American people, have sent a signal to these young people that it is, once again, an honor to wear the uniform.
It is.<eos> He's not contagious anymore.<eos> Is he gonna be all right?<eos> Well, his fever's gone down, and he's drinking water, but he's gonna need some treatment for a while.<eos> I'll stay here until he gets stronger, but you should stop using this place after that.
Just like when you executed my husband in front of me?<eos> I'm doing what Pilcher would have wanted.<eos> But things change, Jason.<eos> They evolve.<eos> And you haven't evolved at all.
Dude, that was me fighting' her off.<eos> Okay.<eos> All right.<eos> Why, who you been seeing these nights you've been bailin' on us?<eos> You know me.
I didn't do it on purpose.<eos> I had a brain freeze.<eos> I panicked.<eos> Mom.<eos> - You two start with the silver.
He and Allen Woods decided to go to another village on their own.<eos> And they never came back.<eos> Do they know where the village is?<eos> Near the Eritrean border.<eos> If you have anything to do with this...
Yeah, yeah.<eos> You're... you're real.<eos> - You're Erin Mantini, here.<eos> - Yes!<eos> And you must be Ders and Adam.
I do not need to defeat you.<eos> I must merely withstand your attacks.<eos> Then withstand this.<eos> Huh?<eos> When I say Spartax, you say Star-Lord!
Do i need a lawyer?<eos> Um, there's just one major question<eos> We have left to answer.<eos> And that is?<eos> That's a deal you'll have to make.
You got it.<eos> This is for you guys.<eos> No, you did not need to do that.<eos> Yes, we did.<eos> You are the reason all four of our little deductions are still alive right now.
Yes, we did.<eos> You are the reason all four of our little deductions are still alive right now.<eos> Babies.<eos> She means babies.<eos> You kept all four safe inside where they belong.
We fought a lot.<eos> Every time I look into one of... You kids's faces, I see her face looking back at me...<eos> Smiling, laughing.<eos> She was strong.<eos> And you're strong.
Every time I look into one of... You kids's faces, I see her face looking back at me...<eos> Smiling, laughing.<eos> She was strong.<eos> And you're strong.<eos> And she was brave, and you're brave.
Oh, please tell me I'm in the back somewhere.<eos> I need to catch up on my sleep.<eos> No...<eos> B4. But the good news is, I'm right behind you.<eos> Well, of course you're all here.
* How To Get Away With Murder * Season 03 Episode 01 "We're Good People Now" Precisely Synchronized by srjanapala<eos> Someone is clearly upset I didn't pick them for this class.<eos> This clinic is pro bono.<eos> We only represent people who can't afford their own lawyers.<eos> You will each compete to become first chair.
Show-off.<eos> All right, tomorrow, each of you will get a chance to present a defense that keeps Karim in this country.<eos> Now, I'll pick two of you for first and second chair.<eos> But be careful.<eos> Winning means that you carry the fate of this entire family in your hands.
"Pencils down."<eos> We all remember those dreaded words from school.<eos> When you heard them, it meant you were out of time.<eos> That's a feeling our Republican presidential hopefuls can relate to.<eos> With only two days left before their first debate, they're cramming like crazy in preparation for the most important test of their lives... a test, my dear Lovers of Liberty, that you will be grading.
Start at my penis.<eos> You fold right now,<eos> And i'll give you another shot at that shrimp buffet Before you hit the road and don't come back.<eos> I'll tell you what.<eos> You fold right now, And i'll give you another crack at the shrimp buffet Before you go home, you.
But you do, so --<eos> Exactly!<eos> I do!<eos> This isn't a negotiation.<eos> I have the high cards, and you have --
A little quaking in your boots wouldn't be inappropriate.<eos> Well, here's how scared I am of you.<eos> My name is Edward Clariss.<eos> Rivals should know each other's names.<eos> I mean, you might as well tell me, since neither of you are leaving this place alive.
How do we do it?<eos> UAVs armed with air-to-surface missiles.<eos> Once we know where they are, we move.<eos> Then that's the plan.<eos> On this tragic day, with you and God as my witness, I announce my candidacy for president of Abuddin.
Everything would be great, if only you didn't have this shit that you got to take care of, this crap that you got to worry about.<eos> Well, I've got news for you.<eos> You love your prison.<eos> You love the prison you've made for yourself.<eos> If somebody came along and broke the lock right now, you wouldn't know what the hell to do with yourself... wouldn't have a clue.
I'm on it, okay?<eos> Your job today is to study.<eos> Hi.<eos> I thought you'd have run off to Mexico to be with Frank by now.<eos> You two get to spend the day babysitting each other.
Um, I hate to win on a technicality, but he was under the water.<eos> That's a baptism.<eos> Maybe we should ask Mazda?<eos> I'm not going to ask him anything, he's drunk.<eos> Oh, and like you're not! ‚ô™ Just hear those sleigh bells jingling ‚ô™
From there, it was scheduled to be boarded onto a ship bound for the Port of Latakia, Syria.<eos> Wonderful.<eos> All right.<eos> We'll take the hospital angle.<eos> You two find out who paid for that container, what else was inside it.
Yes, sir.<eos> Oh! What the hell was that?<eos> That, my friend, was a gift!<eos> Call off your men, Asakeem, or they're all gonna get killed.<eos> None of us are afraid to die. Are you?
Good idea, but you shouldn't go alone.<eos> 1987 is a long way from 1942, and it's dangerous to know too much about the future.<eos> - I can handle myself.<eos> - I'll go with her.<eos> Great, you two reach out to the JSA while the rest of us break into the most secure residence in the country.
Between the two of us, we're more powerful than...<eos> Yeah, everybody in this room combined.<eos> No, no.<eos> That's the point.<eos> That's what you've all proven here.
If you turn on him, we can get you into witness protection.<eos> You'll get a nice, little house somewhere in Florida.<eos> I think you'd love Florida, Bob.<eos> I've never actually been there, but Pitbull's videos make it seem muy caliente.<eos> I know Figgis, and you're in far more danger than I.
And while you were cowering in the panic room, I went and got this file to make sure you weren't lying.<eos> Well, what happened in here?<eos> It looks like there was a fight.<eos> Oh, it was me.<eos> I was done with this place the minute you all stepped foot in it. Oops.
But that's history.<eos> The ones who treated us like slaves are now hiding in some fucking hole or hooked to a machine to stay alive.<eos> They mustn't come back.<eos> Me and Salvatore Conte made a promise and we're keeping it.<eos> You are all the ones who count most at the dealing spots.
Okay.<eos> More importantly, we need to take a look at the possible adverse impact on our property values and on the overall quality of life for the community.<eos> We are the community.<eos> We were here first.<eos> You bought up all our shit.
More importantly, we need to take a look at the possible adverse impact on our property values and on the overall quality of life for the community.<eos> We are the community.<eos> We were here first.<eos> You bought up all our shit.<eos> You're the reason we're homeless.
Y... You know what?<eos> Just think about it.<eos> - Absolutely, Callie.<eos> - Yes, of course.<eos> No, 'cause I know that you and Arizona are friends, too,
What's the difference when there's nothing left anyways?<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> Hans Richter?<eos> He got to me before you did.
You're Thomas Shaw.<eos> I know about De Vos, the black site, the murder of Claudia Gartner, Ingrid Hollander, all of it.<eos> You can take your mind games to the Germans.<eos> You don't wanna do that, Sherlock.<eos> The Germans got to me before you did.
What... Why would you want to kill my station?<eos> - What, I-I-I didn't...<eos> - You have to ask, Steven?<eos> After you've listened to all of Germany's telephone calls and read all our mail?<eos> After you have dragged us into a war on terror that you started?
- Hello?<eos> - Wherever you are, get out now.<eos> You're too late.<eos> Are you...<eos> You were running him.
- Wherever you are, get out now.<eos> You're too late.<eos> Are you...<eos> You were running him.<eos> You and Hans, you were running Hector.
I got nothing.<eos> Yeah, me neither.<eos> Even if we find the blade, it's a temporary fix.<eos> Your mom is the problem.<eos> She released the blade to create chaos, and you two respond by coddling her.
We've got an actual recording budget.<eos> Dude... let's make some music.<eos> Music.<eos> What are the fans saying about me right now?<eos> They're tweeting about your drinks with Pam Anderson last night, speculating if you two are rekindling.
If a nation is seen as weak, it is weak.<eos> Keep pumping.<eos> Fill her up.<eos> Ed, you can go home.<eos> Sara and Frank, you can lay low here with the stuff.
I hope they have it shaved!<eos> Nino, please!<eos> Or is it fluffy? What's it like?<eos> Come on, you won't be able to sleep.<eos> You could have told me my son was here.
I was alone.<eos> I'm going to figure this out. I promise.<eos> You have been chosen from your group because I think you might have come into contact with someone that I'm looking for.<eos> His name is Leo Elster.<eos> When you woke up, he may have reached out to you.
When you woke up, he may have reached out to you.<eos> He may have offered you safety, companionship.<eos> I believe that this man is very dangerous.<eos> Now, there are others out there, like you, and he is preying on them.<eos> You're lucky, because we got to you before he did.
Had our lives turned upside down, breaking our back for this company!<eos> You know what?<eos> Suck my dick, both of you.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah, you're lucky I let you be a part of this in the first place.
Suck my dick, both of you.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah, you're lucky I let you be a part of this in the first place.<eos> This is my company, my idea, my baby, my code.<eos> You had jack shit to do with it.
Do you really think that having needles and a hype kit around is in your son's best interest.<eos> He wasn't even there.<eos> He was at my mom's house, right?<eos> DCFS is on your side, everyone.<eos> They want you to keep your kids.
Amber or Keaton or Jordan or... or Benadryl or whatever the hell your name is.<eos> Okay, who's next?<eos> Do you feel good about yourselves?<eos> Going to this high and mighty all-white private school while leaving my little brown boy Liam out in the cold?<eos> If you little sperm mishaps had any kind of heart at all...
Someone dies every day on your operating table?<eos> Not literally every day, dummy.<eos> On average.<eos> Our condolences, Gretchen.<eos> We should let you two grieve in private.
It was the explosion of sunlight.<eos> And when we exited the tunnel, all of Manhattan was laid out before us.<eos> And that was the best part of the trip... the amazing possibility to be able to go anywhere within something that is magnificent and never-ending.<eos> This is the first Web browser, the rudimentary one CERN built to view and edit research.<eos> I wrote it up here for you to see how simple it is.
- Check.<eos> Check.<eos> Aikin, Valcon, Coach, you check the outbuildings here.<eos> Take them one at a time and slow.<eos> Stripe, Raiman, you come with me and Lennard.
Aikin, Valcon, Coach, you check the outbuildings here.<eos> Take them one at a time and slow.<eos> Stripe, Raiman, you come with me and Lennard.<eos> We go in here.<eos> Len and I will talk to Heidekker, you check the rest of the house. Okay.
But we work and he makes the money.<eos> And he says we're free.<eos> It's not true.<eos> I bought my freedom with blood.<eos> What do you want to do?
Hi. Can we use your salt?<eos> - What?<eos> - Hi.<eos> You're so cute.<eos> You two don't know each other very well, do you?
We're starving in the alley, this gets us by.<eos> You buy your stuff just from us!<eos> - 48 a kilo's too much!<eos> - That's the price!<eos> Screw you, others sell at 30, how come you're selling at 48?
What, it's bulletproof?<eos> I'm insulted!<eos> This is nothing but a window condom? Between you and the people of this community.<eos> You trying to rob us?<eos> You're the ones who are jacking up the fees on the minimum wage guys just so they can access their own money!
You'll need this tube to send the time machine you've got to me in the past.<eos> As far as I'm concerned, to save Lydia, all I need to do is take one more jump.<eos> You're not listening, that isn't even possible...<eos> The machine I used is in the socket in my lab.<eos> You use your machine to go back where you started.
Can you see from the chopper here?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> There are conifers...<eos> Chances are, we won't see anything. Nights falling.<eos> You'll head for this zone here.
When the Son of Man comes in his glory with all his angels.<eos> "He will sit on his glorious throne.<eos> "The King will say to those on his right<eos> "Come, you who are blessed by my father. "Take your inheritance, "the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world.<eos> "For I was hungry "and you gave me something to eat.

We're looking for Vincent.<eos> Has anyone seen him?<eos> What do you want with him?<eos> -We just want to talk to him.<eos> Even if I knew, you're the last person I'd tell.
But when you hear this it will all be over.<eos> I've always wanted to be there for Emile and you.<eos> But I didn't know how.<eos> I failed to protect you.<eos> Now you're paying for my mistakes.
Our thoughts go particularly to Koen and C√©cile and to Lana and Eddy now that No√©mie and Laurent have left us.<eos> We cannot be insensitive to their pain.<eos> Let us pray for those who suffer in this ordeal.<eos> Death is tragic even for us who know that death is just a transition to a more gentle, merciful world... our Lord's world.<eos> Lke you, we are angry.
See the fucking mess you got us into?<eos> Guys...<eos> I've been thinkin'.<eos> It's time to go back home.<eos> My father's home, ours, where you lived before this mess with the Savastanos.
Everyone.<eos> Rhodia and Quill alike.<eos> A planet of three billion, all gone in... one day.<eos> They killed my mother.<eos> You two survived.
I found them a home, but they were supposed to live quietly.<eos> Plus... they called.<eos> We've got a problem.<eos> This is not your normal modus operandi.<eos> You invade in secret.
We've got a problem.<eos> This is not your normal modus operandi.<eos> You invade in secret.<eos> And you kill all at once.<eos> You don't just pour in like any old boring army!
- You gave speeches?<eos> - Since I was seven.<eos> Did I ever fight with friends?<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> And I don't know how to do it, and I don't know how to make my heart stop feeling like this, and I don't know how to stop the true feeling that you've all just been putting up with my stupidity and difference this whole time.
Is that all you ever did?<eos> But I fought you and I will still fight you.<eos> Because you know what?<eos> I am free.<eos> I am free and you are not the last.
I'm sorry.<eos> Get the hell out of my house, you piece of shit.<eos> Missy.<eos> I will be back.<eos> You will invite me.
No, no, this guy... This guy was a drug hound, man.<eos> We couldn't get through the stash in a month if we tried.<eos> Why you telling us this?<eos> Because I'm offering you a trade.<eos> You get the shit.
So here's your tactical report.<eos> Son of a bitch!<eos> - Get down! - Aah!<eos> You got our drugs, but we got your toughie little blonde.<eos> Now, we want the drugs, but you love the little blonde.
You know, like... down there?<eos> ok, well, I'll see you later.<eos> So, I just know that you'll all have done your reading.<eos> Context for discussion of today's topic is the mindset of a soldier.<eos> 338,000 men evacuated, 100,000 of them straight from the beach, and you are one of them.
I don't know, Hans.<eos> I don't know anything about it.<eos> It will have catastrophic effects on the earth.<eos> Our planet will pay a heavy price.<eos> And so will you two if we have to hear a political lecture.
Like... ghosts?<eos> Well, I expect to capture real reactions to what they'll believe are spirits.<eos> So, it's... fake.<eos> Reality is what we make of it.<eos> You of all people should know that.
We're gonna make it!<eos> Come on! Come on!<eos> Let's go! May!<eos> Go through!<eos> - You're gonna make it.
Let's see some badges.<eos> Why would we bring our badges?<eos> We're undercover.<eos> They're back at the precinct.<eos> If you're cops, I'm Princess Grace.
Well, I wish I was here on a social... visit.<eos> Yesterday, Aaron asked me if I knew a Jeffrey Myers.<eos> What?<eos> Why?<eos> Well, you two dated, and now he's serving.
I'm gonna ask it again-- what is... happening?<eos> Uh, the, uh, Xbox Games are coming up.<eos> Uh-huh. We're building up my controller grip strength.<eos> Mm-hmm. No pain... No weakness.<eos> No idea who you two are.
We made sure you had black influences to help you understand your background.<eos> We gave you everything we could.<eos> And all I was supposed to feel was grateful.<eos> I was supposed to just shut up and be thankful that I had these great parents who wanted me when my birth parents didn't.<eos> But the truth is you never wanted me, either.
Listen.<eos> What is this shit?<eos> What are you, fucking zombies?<eos> [all laughing] Is this funny to you?<eos> You know what's really ironic is that none of you have a point of view, but it's all the same fuckin' point of view.
- Well, I think that's a huge mistake.<eos> - What, to defend your husband?<eos> - I didn't say that, Louise.<eos> - Mom, how's this?<eos> "In conclusion, you're ugly.
I've got no leverage with him.<eos> I need you to handle it, please.<eos> Okay.<eos> Shift change in 10 minutes.<eos> You pulled it off...
None?<eos> Nada.<eos> I want to have another conversation with Carter.<eos> We don't know where he is.<eos> You don't, but I do.
Beale!<eos> Sorry.<eos> Listen.<eos> All I do know is I was hired by someone in the Russian FSB-- the secret service-- to find a woman names Katerina Polunin.<eos> Now, I discovered she goes by the name of Mary Reynolds, but before I could track her down, you shot me.
We actually met in his class.<eos> Right?<eos> Students.<eos> Yeah, we were sitting in the front row, and we kept looking at each other, and then finally Frank stopped the class and said,<eos> "You two are distracting me.
I will not apologize for the fact that it's hard to explain to people.<eos> Okay, Daddy.<eos> Also, William, thank you for offering to teach me piano, but I don't think at this point in our relationship it would be healthy to introduce that dynamic.<eos> And so, starting next Tuesday, I'm gonna be taking piano lessons from Mrs. Perkins down the road.<eos> There's gonna be a recital in the spring, and I hope that you will all come and support me in this.
We only had three.<eos> But I was still able to use call records from the cell tower closest to the blast to track The Ghost's location.<eos> No easy task in New York, where the buildings can reflect...<eos> Hey, who are you talking to, Riley?<eos> Uh... I-I thought you guys, but apparently I'm just talking to myself.
Even took a trip to Washington, D.C., and had my picture made with the Congressman.<eos> Never had any children, of course.<eos> Which is why it was so important that I made it here tonight.<eos> To see each of you.<eos> You are my children!
You know that I do.<eos> You're just one step closer than her, and you're our better bet.<eos> The human will to resist is the most durable and complicated safe you could ever want to crack.<eos> Just as world-class bank robbers use drills, torches, and even dynamite when necessary, enhanced interrogation techniques can be your tool to break the truth out of someone, or have them broken out of you.<eos> We will take you to the brink to see whether or not you'll give up your secrets, your country, or yourself.
It's Ryan.<eos> He found something.<eos> Finally something to work with.<eos> You seem to have made a unanimous decision to strike.<eos> Well, I have no doubt you all feel incredibly confident in your answers, but... what happens away from the desks?
This was launched from a classified partner air base in the region.<eos> The CIA techs you see are working in conjunction with drone pilots, out of Creech Air Force Base in Nevada, to execute this strike.<eos> Do we kill a man today or not?<eos> Red light or green light.<eos> You decide.
Wow, you unplugged that phone faster than we unplugged my Aunt Esther.<eos> She was a mean lady.<eos> Sophie, ready to re-enter the workforce?<eos> I'm ready.<eos> The question is, are you ready?
Any and every agent meeting, dead drop, or intelligence gathering, you have to assume you're not alone.<eos> Find your path, know it backwards and forwards.<eos> That's how you survive.<eos> I once ran a live SDR for 38 straight hours.<eos> And you probably will, too, one day.
All right, come on in.<eos> - Rough day?<eos> - You too?<eos> Come on.<eos> Today you all experienced your first live SDR.
Monica, Joan told us that your parents are doctors.<eos> Yes, my father is a cardiologist, and my mother works in the emergency room.<eos> Damn, I admire emergency doctors.<eos> They must see everything. They have to be well-prepared.<eos> Well, you're living far from school, right?
- Ivan, I'm sorry,<eos> - You'd better.<eos> He forced me to tell him. We continue with Kant.<eos> Some authors told him that the truth didn't have to be kept at any cost.<eos> What do you think?
- If you want, I'll...<eos> - No need.<eos> I can walk alone to places.<eos> Thanks, anyway.<eos> Why are you laughing? Well done.
- No, Berta. She's nice.<eos> But is Quima gay or straight?<eos> Because obviously, he's a man but now a woman. Then does she like men or women..?<eos> No, I'm serious.<eos> Anyway, you two are gay. I'm sure it's your thing.
You insisted me to give her.<eos> That worked in the 20th century, not now! Joan, Joan!<eos> - If you hadn't... - I know.<eos> The worst thing is that I seem like you.<eos> I'm as boring as you are.
And start thinking which awesome gift you'll give Pau for his 12th birthday.<eos> That kid deserves everything! Unbelievable!<eos> You've given me lessons for being a mom.<eos> I've been doing that for a long time.<eos> Marc. You think I like spending the nights here while you're sleeping?
And with shoes.<eos> "That's what you think of me?"<eos> "A bad mother?"<eos> "You are selfish, children of mine."<eos> "Because things have not gone like you wanted..."
I'm fucked here.<eos> Luck won't last forever.<eos> Those who have a fantastic body will age.<eos> And those who have power will someday die alone.<eos> But now you have a great luck to have me as your teacher.
YEAH!<eos> Go back to your seat.<eos> One moment. The freedom thing is important, right, guys?<eos> Because... Well, what will each of you do tonight?<eos> Because if everything is destined, if everything is expected, as Boethius puts it, the decision that you make about what you will do tonight is totally illusory.
All this has expiration date.<eos> Those who have fame today, tomorrow will be forgotten;<eos> Those who have a fantastic body will age;<eos> And those who have power will someday die alone.<eos> But now you have the great luck to have me as your teacher.
No one deserves to die this way, guys.<eos> No one.<eos> Today, in the yard, we will do a minute of silence in her memory.<eos> And the staff, as a sign of mourning, has decided that today there will be no classes.<eos> But you will stay here.
Two people witnessed the shooting from another building.<eos> They were too far away to see the shooter's face, but they could tell it was a man.<eos> And what do we know about the victim?<eos> Brandon has no family in town, but he does live with a roommate-- a Reggie Tiller, in West L.A.<eos> You two head downtown to the crime scene.
I hardly knew 'er.<eos> Boom.<eos> "We're Noah's ark.<eos> Look at us.<eos> "I'm Noah, and you're all the animals."
And what was his intention with that?<eos> To help me get the word out.<eos> I cannot stress to you what a treacherous journey this has been.<eos> This is about gross human-right violations.<eos> What you can see is only 25-second snippets because this is the only way to get it out.
I did not expect God's grace, but now I had to open myself to the pain of it, to feel the joy of it.<eos> And that's a word we use around the holiday times: joy.<eos> 'Cause the holidays are hard times.<eos> But tonight I'll go back to my son's house, have Christmas with his beautiful family, and stay up late enough to feel Christmas Eve turn into Christmas Day, one last time.<eos> And you gave me that.
You want to see our records?<eos> Here!<eos> Here they are!<eos> You know, there is blood on your hands, too.<eos> You're the parents.
It's more about protecting the office.<eos> Look, i think we both know you should have been president.<eos> Maybe i've been hard on you 'cause i'm jealous.<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> You two keep making out while i carry the dead goat.
You get into Joe's scented markers again?<eos> So now, I have scary Russian squatters who won't leave.<eos> We'll have a small window when Mitchell goes to the gym.<eos> He usually stretches, takes a lap around the locker room, and then gets a smoothie.<eos> You two deal with the Russians, and I'll keep Mitch distracted.
You think this Maria Thompkins is somehow tied into this?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm gonna find out, though.<eos> Here.<eos> You two just make sure those astronauts get off the Moon.
We have a problem.<eos> The world is about to change, starting with a pig in a little white hat, bleeding out for all the world to see.<eos> And that kind of change brings opportunities.<eos> Opportunities that vanish if my entire family turns up dead.<eos> And I don't want that. Do you?
We just want to make sure he's not a deranged serial killer.<eos> Or a vegan.<eos> That would tear this family apart, Elle.<eos> Okay, I am perfectly capable of judging someone's character on my own, thank you.<eos> Plus, there's nothing you'd uncover that an NCIS background investigation hasn't already.
- if she stole a car or something.<eos> - Okay.<eos> And this area right here.<eos> Okay.<eos> You head this way, yeah, and we'll just, like, look at these...
Emperor, gladiators are slaves.<eos> The Emperor cannot be--<eos> I'm not asking for your permission, Dio.<eos> The Senate will be in attendance.<eos> You and all of Rome will bear witness to my triumph.
- With rocks.<eos> - Come on, guys.<eos> Getting back at people isn't what Christmas is all about.<eos> It's about being together, as a family.<eos> So you can plot your petty revenge, but I, for one, am gonna carol my heart out.
That is not what my brother says.<eos> I lied to him so I could talk to you.<eos> And here I am.<eos> Your boss, Louise, is not one to be trusted.<eos> Clearly, neither are you.
- That is crazy!<eos> - Come on.<eos> - You guys are, uh...<eos> - Come on.<eos> - You're, uh...
We decided to go with you.<eos> Uh, we were told that you were going with Raviga.<eos> And I am happy to say that is no longer the case.<eos> We're really excited to be in business with you guys.<eos> Can I ask... Did you walk away from them, or did they walk away from you because of the lawsuit?
Whoa, whoa, I did not call you a pussy.<eos> I said that people who break term-sheet agreements are pussies, and that hasn't happened... yet.<eos> Thus I haven't called you a pussy... yet.<eos> You're in control of the situation.<eos> Hooli has the unlimited resources to hamstring you until Nucleus comes out, at which point, they will be the market standard, and you will be irrelevant.
There is no way we are speaking to that smug, duplicitous talking scarf.<eos> If you do this for me, I will take you to a Golden Globes gifting suite.<eos> Say more.<eos> So this is fantastic.<eos> It's sophisticated and hilarious, and you've been hearing that stuff all day long.
Well, congratulations, um, to your sister.<eos> And as far as me not being right for your thing, I get it.<eos> Hello?<eos> Makes total sense.<eos> Of course, you really only know me from this, which is hardly the most...
But it's fine, really.<eos> It's your show.<eos> You know what you want.<eos> Who am I to tell you?<eos> Come on, you're the geniuses behind Pucks!
Why don't you give him one of yours?<eos> You have so many.<eos> I don't want one of his.<eos> - And I don't got so many. - Shh.<eos> You shh.
- We think it's a huge mistake, but what can you do?<eos> - Fight it.<eos> That's what you can do.<eos> It's your show.<eos> You should have a say in who's in it.
let me take you in my arms."<eos> If you want to marry her, you must learn English.<eos> In 30 days.<eos> English in 30 days.<eos> One tight slap and you'll learn your lesson in 30 seconds.
~ Then you should apply to Mr Norrell, sir. ~ Huh.<eos> No, no.<eos> In the Raven King's times, sir, his times, when there were no books of magic, a young fellow with a talent would knock on the door of an older<eos> ~ magician, and ask to be apprenticed.<eos> ~ Gentlemen, you of all people should know that Gilbert Norrell does not look favourably on other magicians.
My government will assist you in any way you wish.<eos> Mr Segundus has it in mind to establish a school for magicians.<eos> I think this will suit our purpose nicely.<eos> You of all people should know that
Oh, who loves her, Stephen?<eos> Not the magician, he has abandoned her.<eos> Who loves Lady Pole with her dreary disposition?<eos> And who loves you?<eos> No, it is best for you all to be at my house, where it is known you are of kingly birth and no-one frowns at this.
You know what?<eos> Forget it.<eos> I could never deal with this every single day.<eos> Well, congratulations.<eos> You two are officially the gayest couple here.
I shall travel to Ravelkhedi tomorrow...<eos> Bajirao is unwell.<eos> And nothing can happen till I return with him.<eos> Are you scared, Grandmother?<eos> You all may bow down before Mastani...
Fracking.<eos> - That's right - fracking.<eos> I know you're all part of this.<eos> And... what exactly is 'this'?<eos> You tell me.
We need to find another tear to talk to my friends, so we can find a way to get me home.<eos> - What's happening?<eos> - You did this. Run!<eos> Why did you say I did this?<eos> You go inside.
They think I'm...<eos> Hang on a minute.<eos> Long story short, this is an opportunity.<eos> Are you alright?<eos> I don't know. Why don't you tell me... "guys"...?
- What doesn't make you hungry?<eos> - Food.<eos> Come on.<eos> We've got to find this altar.<eos> You go inside.
I wouldn't do that, big guy.<eos> - Clay...<eos> - Trust me, I wouldn't.<eos> Well, you obviously know that we are witches.<eos> And we know that you are werewolves.
Well, you obviously know that we are witches.<eos> And we know that you are werewolves.<eos> Let's get that out of the way so we can begin.<eos> Can't believe we summoned witches.<eos> You didn't summon us.
The Undoing.<eos> I want her to be calm which requires you to be calm.<eos> You're losing control.<eos> If she can sense me, then she knows that I won't let you go through with it.<eos> You werewolves are such an... interesting species.
When the Mutts attacked you here, how did it feel?<eos> Fighting for your life, protecting your home?<eos> We did what we had to do.<eos> Wasn't our choice, but it was our fight.<eos> What would you have done?
You'll pay for this.<eos> Aleister: All is not as it may seem on the surface.<eos> It is what's inside of you that is the truth.<eos> But, it's your essence, your history, your future.<eos> Every drop you have moves through your whole body in a minute.
Cheers!<eos> - Cheers!<eos> Hear, hear!<eos> - Hey, thank you, thank you.<eos> Because of him... you will all be on television very soon, on The Elsa Mars Hour.
You think you're so smart.<eos> You don't know anything, you stupid freak.<eos> He's only trying to help.<eos> Oh, shut up, you ugly cow.<eos> No one cares what you think, any of you.
Wait, wait.<eos> You're behaving very strangely.<eos> Saturn's return.<eos> Hey, Brokemons. I just wanted to let you know that I will be abstaining from the vote today.<eos> You are my two all-time best friends, and you brought me back from the brink, so I can't choose sides.
Yeah!<eos> I just have one more thing to say, Pawnee.<eos> Psych!<eos> Do you think I care about how much you love this stupid diner?<eos> I bought it for a song, and I'm gonna sell it for a mint, and you can all just sit there, pulling on your puds.
All right.<eos> Easy, easy. If you start feeding, you won't be able to stop, and then he's dead, and the rest of us still starve, all right?<eos> Look at me.<eos> I have been at war in the trenches starved with my men.<eos> If we fought through it then, you can now.
I had to turn to the only people I knew I could trust... And I told them that they had to deal with you.<eos> My only regret is that I didn't stop you before you killed one of our own, and now you have to be punished.<eos> No.<eos> Hrrgh... You're all so mean, like the mouse that torments the cat in those cartoons.<eos> I think you're the ones who need to be punished.
Worst is first, yeah, and then Charlie and I, we made a blood oath, so now we are in cahoots.<eos> - Ugh! - I'm on their side.<eos> - Nasty.<eos> You idiots. Did you not think that I had anticipated this?<eos> While you were running around town like lunatics, chopping your hands to bits, I did a little bit of research.
I highly doubt that he developed Alzheimer's.<eos> But I guess it is plausible that they were abducted by aliens.<eos> So, uh... You guys got everything you need?<eos> Are you in a hurry?<eos> Oh, you're not in a hurry?
And while no one is happy about this situation, we still have a job to do, and I expect you all to remain professional about it.<eos> To that end, Commissioner Santana is here to say a few words.<eos> Okay, I will be conducting a review of all case files during Sergeant Shaw's tenure.<eos> I'm going to need a couple of volunteers.<eos> McNally, Epstein, you'll do.
See?<eos> That's the spirit, nash.<eos> Um, let's deal with today.<eos> Uh, moore, you're on the front desk.<eos> Mcstein, you got to get over to city view music festival.
Um, let's deal with today.<eos> Uh, moore, you're on the front desk.<eos> Mcstein, you got to get over to city view music festival.<eos> Some scalpers are bugging kids.<eos> What? "dice," you're on patrol.
So it's gonna be a whole planet of another kind of people and it's not gonna be good, 'cause they got their own--<eos> 'Cause we're very, like, egocentric.<eos> We think that if there's aliens, they're gonna come and they're gonna be like,<eos> "Hey, you guys, we're the aliens.<eos> You're, like, people, but we're just aliens.
‚ô™ Will slowly go by ‚ô™<eos> ‚ô™ And feed ‚ô™<eos> ‚ô™ Them on your dreams ‚ô™<eos> ‚ô™ The one they picks ‚ô™<eos> ‚ô™ The one you'll know by ‚ô™
Bhrain!<eos> Lucais!<eos> It's about time.<eos> I was beginning to think you weren't gonna grace us With your presence, Mr. Horrocks.<eos> You two lads know each other?
Better.<eos> - Here is he?<eos> - Scott.<eos> Go, boss.<eos> So while you two were busy losing the source, I made some progress on the names we got.
Come on.<eos> - Get out.<eos> - Once we hand her over, I'm done.<eos> She's right, I gave everything to my country, my world, my son, everything and I've nothing left to give.<eos> If you two want to return to active service, go ahead but I am out.
I don't know why.<eos> I think I maybe know why.<eos> Okay.<eos> Because we're the future.<eos> You don't belong in it.
Thack, that's madness.<eos> No, what's madness is using ether regardless of the dangers.<eos> I'm gonna prove we don't need to use it and I want people to pay attention.<eos> And you think a circus stunt is the way to do it?<eos> Well, you'll watch and so will everyone else.
I mean, she was originally interested in us as a duo.<eos> Well, then, she gets what she's always wanted.<eos> - And she's practically family to you, right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Is it just me or are you not making eye contact?
One more time for The Exes! Well, I'm sure we missed somethin' pretty special with those two.<eos> Hey, y'all.<eos> Oh, thank you very much.<eos> Well, I can't tell ya, uh, what it feels like to see so many, uh, familiar and caring' faces out there.<eos> You're about the best extended family a guy could have at a time like this.
My help cometh from the Lord which made heaven and earth.<eos> He will not suffer thy foot to be moved.<eos> He will keepeth thee and will not slumber.<eos> Behold, He that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep.<eos> Brothers, if anyone is caught in any transgression, you who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness.
Glen?<eos> My goodness.<eos> How old are you?<eos> 18.<eos> So, you two have stayed in touch?
This is not helping Athos.<eos> I'm going to find out.<eos> Whether you help me or not.<eos> Oh, Goddamn you.<eos> You've brought me back.
Perhaps it is time for a change.<eos> Treville has been your most loyal servant.<eos> You don't understand politics at all, my dear, hm?<eos> Leave this sort of thing to the men.<eos> I want you all to know that no blame falls on any of you.
~ Come in here.<eos> Come here, come here, look.<eos> Beers, cheers, and fuck 'em.<eos> Right, major fuck-me vibes at three o'clock.<eos> You take the daughters.
Drugs?<eos> Drugs?<eos> Am I on fucking drugs?<eos> You're the one who's trying to steal my baby!<eos> You're the baby thieves.
Don't worry.<eos> First time's always a quickie.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, listen.<eos> Since I'm back, why don't you two get out of here and go enjoy the rest of the equinox?
What?<eos> - No!<eos> - Let her go! (Indistinct shouting)<eos> - Don't let them take me! - You... you stay away from her.<eos> You all stay away from my daughter.
Please, God.<eos> Help me to understand your plan.<eos> You're the woman from my vision.<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> And you... are the Messengers.
Easy.<eos> Can't be 30.<eos> Raquel's not old enough.<eos> Bryan!<eos> So, Ben, how long have you two been together?
We're trapped.<eos> I say we use the Sky Girl to draw fire.<eos> - You got a problem?<eos> - Yes.<eos> You are the bringers of death.
I thought we'd try something a little different this time.<eos> There's only 20 minutes of oxygen in Maya's suit.<eos> I know she's a friend of yours.<eos> 20 minutes, your friend will either suffocate or burn...<eos> But you can save her.
Good.<eos> I'm glad you're not coming.<eos> You know, the New York Times said, um, half the increase in support of gay marriage is due to generational turnover.<eos> You guys lost, okay?<eos> And honestly, the rest of us are just... going about our business, being normal and waiting for you not to be around...
May I remind you that if we don't win sectionals, Glee Club no longer exists.<eos> Do you think Sue Sylvester is giving Vocal Adrenaline a five minute break?<eos> No.<eos> This weekend, I saw them walking on hot coals.<eos> If Oprah can do this, so can you.
It's liberating', I think-- pissing' someplace where you're not supposed ta.<eos> When I was a sergeant, I pissed in my CO's desk drawer when he was in Hawaii.<eos> I drank six coffees and a Nehi first.<eos> Now, that was a good piss.<eos> Well, you got the hardware for it.
Hayley and hope belong in the compound, where they're safe.<eos> As much as I would like Elijah's help to kill Finn, if his delicate sensibilities are offended by the presence of Hayley's new husband, then he's welcome to continue sulking across the river.<eos> As I have explained to you repeatedly, brother, my presence here in algiers is purely to assemble allies, and given all the enemies we have afoot in the form of wayward siblings and ancient, maniacal aunt dahlias, I would think that you would applaud my efforts.<eos> Well, if it's my applause you seek, you shouldn't have dashed off in a bloody huff.<eos> All right. Can you two at least try and stay focused on what's best for hope's safety?
You want the leaves to talk, you got to sip the tea.<eos> You, too, Marcel.<eos> This is your house.<eos> Spell won't work if you're not part of it.<eos> The leaves say you were both with a dark side and fought against your nature.
We cleared the register from that diner on 10th.<eos> No.<eos> The part where you and had red one stood in front of your shotgun and somehow he's still not dead.<eos> Now you know the deal, boys.<eos> You take me down first, you walk out alive.
Daniel Brickwell.<eos> It seems we have a common interest.<eos> You know that Brickwell killed your wife.<eos> Her name was Rebecca.<eos> Since my death, maintaining my usual network of associates has become--heh-- shall we say, problematic, but the fact that you were able to locate Mr. Brickwell despite the fact that he has gone to ground demonstrates your group's capacity.
Well, look at that.<eos> Didn't anybody tell you Halloween was 3 months ago?<eos> Daniel Brickwell...<eos> You have failed this city.<eos> And you seem to have failed in your maths.
I was going to ask you a favor,<eos> But it doesn't seem like the right time.<eos> Well, it depends.<eos> What's the favor?<eos> You and the arrow, you're...
I don't care!<eos> Oliver, he is stronger than that!<eos> I did not come here to debate.<eos> Laurel insisted that I bring this news to you myself, but I can see all I'm doing is damaging your memory of him.<eos> Perhaps it is better for you to not think of what Oliver has become.
I'm a minister.<eos> It's a long story.<eos> Normally this is the part where the officiant offers words of insight about the couple, their history.<eos> Which is a little difficult for me because I just met John and Lyla about eight minutes ago.<eos> And I understand that you have written your own vows, which is great, because that gives me less to do.
We cannot let Pakistan think they can shoot down our drone and we will do nothing!<eos> How high was your drone flying?<eos> 45,000 feet.<eos> Do you really think Pakistan has the technology to shoot down a drone at that altitude?<eos> You shot down our drone?
- Well, I had a big night.<eos> - What do you mean, you had a big...?<eos> - Try to contain your enthusiasm. - Mm-hmm.<eos> She's just... excited.<eos> Take it you two are an item now.
It is.<eos> And the best gift... is you and Lemon.<eos> Couldn't ask for a better man for my girl to end up with.<eos> W-Well, that means a lot.<eos> But... how on earth did you two end up an item out of nowhere like this?
It'll make him look like a folk hero.<eos> It'll validate him as a leader.<eos> And that's not what China wants.<eos> Please, weed dealer, tell me why.<eos> Because you and Pakistan are allies and Zaman is bat-shit crazy and you don't wanna be put into the position of defending him to the world when he fucking nukes Israel.
I want a clean start.<eos> Man.<eos> If you had any kind of something, you wouldn't be sitting there.<eos> All that nonsense Carter pulled on you.<eos> You all look like bitches.
I left to get away from them.<eos> Trust me.<eos> I know what it's like to want freedom from your parents.<eos> They were trying to control me.<eos> Now you're trying to do the same.
So something like this might be our murder weapon.<eos> - Might be?<eos> - Well, it could generate the wound pattern on his forehead.<eos> But the question is, could anyone swing it hard enough to do so?<eos> So which if you is the best user of a bat?
- Meaning what?<eos> - Meaning that it's over.<eos> The fight's done.<eos> We know how this stuff goes-- there's a whole lot of effort and very little result, and I don't know about you guys, but I got better things to do with my time.<eos> I'm sure you do, too.
She needs to feed.<eos> She's getting weaker?<eos> If we don't wake her up, Bo is gonna starve to death.<eos> I got it, I got it, I got it.<eos> What part of stay in the clubhouse did you two not understand?
Who would have thunk it, huh?<eos> Yeah, all of us in happy couples.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You with his ex, you with his.<eos> Me with her, you okay with it.
A city street will run blood red, of course.<eos> Oh, it's more dark pink, but still...<eos> Fourth omen.<eos> We should get out there.<eos> But you're my only...
She and that Woodrugh guy both thought I did Davis.<eos> Think I've been working for you the whole time.<eos> Too bad you weren't.<eos> Honestly, Ray, nobody had an idea you were this competent.<eos> You all bought your way into Vinci with the stones.
Can't you come with us?<eos> I wish I could. I have way too much work to do.<eos> But you don't work.<eos> I have to work selling this house.<eos> - (Trunk closes) - You two have fun!
You can do that, right?<eos> Right.<eos> Mr. Kantos.<eos> I guess I shouldn't be surprised to see you here.<eos> You two are quite the pair.
- I can hardly bear to Look at you.<eos> - But, Sire...<eos> You Musketeers return to your garrison.<eos> Am Ito be a prisoner, then?<eos> Oi! You need to learn some respect!
Are you sure?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I went to the doctor about something else.<eos> We did a blood test.<eos> I was as shocked as you are, obviously.
No, it wasn't.<eos> I just, I was just like, cute...<eos> You know, I'm not trying to start a whole conversation.<eos> You are seriously beautiful, like, really, really beautiful.<eos> No, you are. Whoa! Holy (Bleep)!
Well, she knew the story.<eos> You know, she had good details.<eos> I mean, she seemed like a reliable witness.<eos> It wasn't my brother's fault.<eos> But you two had doubts?
You gonna stop trying to be one of us, or are you gonna be one of us?<eos> I am.<eos> -You are?<eos> -I am.<eos> You are what? -One of you.
Stand down, stand down, stand down.<eos> ¬°Justicia para todos! I love being a cop.<eos> I love workin' with you.<eos> Wanna know why I lied to you all?<eos> Because if you knew I was Latino, you'd never let me be one of you.
I gave myself up for her.<eos> And you feel good about that?<eos> You called 911 after she was overdosing, after you got into a fight with drug dealers.<eos> You do the little bit you can and you're proud of yourself?<eos> The way you two are, is any of this normal or good?
Then come with me.<eos> At least I'll have company on the way.<eos> We'll get there before night fall.<eos> Come...<eos> No sweetheart you go.
The King is not to be disturbed.<eos> He's in private conference.<eos> With whom?<eos> The House of Hapsburg has tried to remain indifferent to your war but the Spanish lose patience and wish us to intervene.<eos> You have claim by inheritance. Ours is by law.
Oh, yeah.<eos> Dude, here you come.<eos> Yo, you were, like, terrifying.<eos> I was legit scared.<eos> Yeah, only 'cause you sold it so hard.
Got what?<eos> Who's she talking to?<eos> When we open that door, turn left, Harold.<eos> You and I are going to the server room to hack the system and stabilize the market.<eos> You two--Reese, Fusco-- secure our escape route.
It's a hell of a time for your machine to go on the fritz, Harold.<eos> Give it a second, it's got a lot on its mind.<eos> Got it.<eos> Who's she talking to?<eos> When we open that door, you two turn left.
Alex mendez rsvp'd yes.<eos> So?<eos> So you had a huge crush on him.<eos> And remember, you two were vibing At the graduation party?<eos> You two vibed?
Thank you very much.<eos> Let's get to the point.<eos> - I'm not a pretentious man.<eos> - Of course not.<eos> - You know me.
Just the simple promise of his freedom.<eos> You ruined my life!<eos> All our lives!<eos> We stood by you after everything that happened.<eos> I can see how this must be difficult for you to understand, but trust me, your lives now are so much better because of what I have done for you.
Labels are for jars, not people, am I right?<eos> But whatever, we hate labels.<eos> We're together.<eos> And that's what's important to us, right?<eos> Wait, you two are... a couple?
We need to get out of town.<eos> You're not going anywhere.<eos> The FBI has sketches of us.<eos> If they get on to Neil, they could find us.<eos> You're the ones who brought him into this.
We'll never have another invitation to Carson's house without a warrant.<eos> Just keep that third eye open<eos> Oh, there's Major.<eos> Can we go over?<eos> How are you two?
Yeah... and that bus of seniors.<eos> Oh, just wait.<eos> We haven't even gotten into the lettuces yet.<eos> yep, I'm gonna say it... of the "iceberg," heh.<eos> While you two are giggling over nut butters...
I was gonna ask you the same thing.<eos> I'm Orion. Are you friend or foe?<eos> - So you're an angel.<eos> - Yes, I am.<eos> And you are Witnesses.
I haven't had a siesta since my first Communion!<eos> - You're all nudists!<eos> -Nudists and dopers!<eos> Because we can!<eos> You couldn't handle two tokes!
He's snapped.<eos> He's not the same man.<eos> He's dangerous.<eos> And he's got Hal.<eos> If you're not back in 72 hours, I'm coming after you.
I should have been there to... help you through it.<eos> I miss you. Ahh! Well, all of New York is reeling this morning.<eos> 4 firefighters from Engine Company 360 were slain last night.<eos> The FBI has stated that alleged serial killer Mark Gray and an Ohio couple Daisy and Kyle Locke are being sought in connection to the crime.<eos> The motive is not clear, but "heroes die while you lie"
You need to get into quarantine.<eos> Come with us.<eos> You think I'm sick?<eos> I'm invincible!<eos> So you're the ones they're looking for.
Take as much fucking territory as you want, just not from each other.<eos> What if the issue is outside this room?<eos> If one of you at this table has a problem, that problem belongs to us all.<eos> We make more money together than apart.<eos> If you ain't trying to do that, You and your crew should step off now.
Wait till you see.<eos> Show them, bro.<eos> So you're yakuza.<eos> No one's afraid of yakuza anymore.<eos> Get cocky and I'll have you picked up.
I understand.<eos> Trouble at the office.<eos> I have to go back.<eos> What?<eos> You two enjoy your stay.
It's important to learn how to deal with the smaller issues before the bigger ones come along.<eos> That way you're prepared.<eos> There's a questionnaire that was created by some psychologists to help gain a better understanding of your partner.<eos> It's called "The Experimental Generation of Interpersonal Closeness."<eos> You two haven't been together that long.
People are dying, Detective.<eos> Somehow, somebody is getting ordinary people to do extraordinary things.<eos> Things that nobody should be able to do.<eos> We have to stop whoever's behind this before someone else gets hurt.<eos> So you're the ones they're looking for.
Well, I'm asking you to make that happen.<eos> Surely you know the camp is overrun.<eos> Thousands of new refugees are pouring in each day.<eos> You are risking disease and starvation on a massive scale.<eos> Our strength is our suffering, and you provide us with an endless supply.
Our strength is our suffering, and you provide us with an endless supply.<eos> We know that there are expenses involved in providing additional security.<eos> We're willing to reimburse you.<eos> We can wire money for that or deliver it to you personally.<eos> You killed my son... in Beirut.
We were roughhousing.<eos> Have you seen these?<eos> You do not survive a battle with these unscathed.<eos> Take it down, take it out!<eos> How old are you two?
What a waste.<eos> Maria.<eos> Leave me alone.<eos> Maria, where is Elishia keeping you all?<eos> You and her, you want... .. you want to hide the Lord's miracle.
On the couch.<eos> - Arggh! - That's it.<eos> Put him down, put him down. Arggh!<eos> I'll go get some painkillers.<eos> You two keep an eye on him.
What?<eos> Being dead?<eos> Exactly.<eos> Perhaps, Charlie, it... it's better than the life here.<eos> You see... .. Maria and you... .. and Kirstie and Kate -- none of you are supposed to be here.
Also, would you like to have dinner with me tonight?<eos> - I'd love that.<eos> Where-where-where are they taking us? Hell if I know.<eos> MIKE: Listen up, punks!<eos> You're all here for the same reason!
That I took her, it's over, so you could stay with Jude at the Fosters.<eos> - What's going on, Callie?<eos> - I did something wrong and I couldn't tell you.<eos> Is this why you're going to live with Robert?<eos> I just thought that if I left on my own it wouldn't hurt as much as if you told me to go but it does.
My parents are finally proud of me.<eos> What, is this because we made-out earlier?<eos> You beautiful boy.<eos> Don't you see?<eos> I am Thomas Jefferson, and you are Stockholm syndrome.
And when you lent me that sweater last week,<eos> - was I supposed to, like...<eos> - Ruth!<eos> It's unscrupulous, Ms. Day.<eos> If you two are coming out, we are, too.
- Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> So that event I'm working tonight,<eos> Sean's actually working it with me.<eos> So are you two...
So when he asked you about the driver, you said that you didn't know anything, but you did know.<eos> You knew the driver was Tony Agrerro-- his name's right on the side of the truck.<eos> Okay, so maybe we didn't tell CSI-- what, Stokes?<eos> -- everything, but, you know, obviously, you found your way to Tony Agrerro.<eos> Not before you got to him first.
I need you to go back in and grab it.<eos> If I'm gonna do this, you're gonna tell me about your mission.<eos> Rudy, your brother, he paid me a visit.<eos> He threatened my daughter.<eos> Look, we know you get sick.
It's all in the meat.<eos> You don't think that people that are fans of you would like to hear what you had in mind, maybe?<eos> - Or what you were... - I'd rather hear what they have in mind, you know? And how they interpret it.<eos> In "Teen Spirit" you seem to complain about the apathy of our generation.<eos> And do you share this lack of engagement yourself?
- See?<eos> Theodore says that if they're sparrows they'll be flying in less than 12 days.<eos> If they're albatrosses, we're in trouble.<eos> Albatrosses have a 270 day fledgling period.<eos> Thanks for guarding the nest with me. Uh-oh. This is what you do when you're working?
I'm scaling the blanket rations inversely to the wattage of each person's phone.<eos> That way the person who killed us the most will die the soonest, which feels fair.<eos> Right, Britta?<eos> I can't go all night being this angry.<eos> Heart attacks run in my family and you people aren't worth it.
But they go in with riot gear, they'll create a riot.<eos> That's what happened in Ferguson.<eos> Okay, but with all due respect to the governor, we're deferring to the police on this.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> You're playing politics because you want police support in four years.
You're fired.<eos> You needed to close this down immediately.<eos> You didn't.<eos> Now I have to settle for $75 million.<eos> You cost me $60 million.
Kalinda's really been working overtime for you.<eos> We want you back, David.<eos> I guess you just can't quit me, can you?<eos> What do you want, David?<eos> We get no justice, you get no peace.
We want you back, David.<eos> I guess you just can't quit me, can you?<eos> What do you want, David?<eos> We get no justice, you get no peace.<eos> We get no justice, you get no peace.
I guess you just can't quit me, can you?<eos> What do you want, David?<eos> We get no justice, you get no peace.<eos> We get no justice, you get no peace.<eos> We get no justice, you get no peace.
We get no justice, you get no peace.<eos> Eli, we need to talk now.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> ...you get no peace.<eos> We get no justice, you get no peace.
It's good to meet you, Deidre.<eos> I'm sorry about the death of your husband.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I think we all want the same thing.<eos> We get no justice, you get no peace!
What is this, an intervention?<eos> I can't believe you guys are ganging up on me.<eos> We're just trying to make you understand that you are making a huge mistake.<eos> No, I am trying to rectify one.<eos> And, by the way, the position that I am taking is the same one you all used to take.
If you have concerns, there is a sign-up sheet.<eos> - Now...<eos> - Give me the bullhorn.<eos> All right, listen.<eos> I want you back in your homes as much as you do, but right now...
You did me a favor.<eos> Without you, I never would have realized that<eos> Caroline wasn't the right girl for me.<eos> But enough about me.<eos> What did you gals get into last night?
Soon, VAL will shape the emotions of millions of users, and Fetch Retrieve will be one of the most powerful advertising and content delivery platforms in the world.<eos> And if a few people commit suicide along the way, tough luck.<eos> I feel awful about what happened to Paul Zimmerman.<eos> But he was the unfortunate consequence of a successful test.<eos> And I'm not gonna let you or Anna Mueller or anyone else destroy what I've worked so hard to build.
I don't care what you say, okay?<eos> There's definitely something weird going on around here.<eos> Morning, boys.<eos> Bonnie's babysitting barn is open for business.<eos> You birth 'em, we nurse 'em.
Well, I'm sorry you find us so boring.<eos> That's one hell of a truck you got there.<eos> 22-inch rims, Alpine subs, Kicker amp.<eos> My boy Rico hooked us up.<eos> I'm glad you're treating yourself.
I know, it's crazy.<eos> It doesn't make any sense.<eos> You've never seen that car before?<eos> Uh, no, no.<eos> You towed the car.
All right.<eos> Wait.<eos> They're my guys.<eos> What I done, boys, is set you up nicer than an umbrella salesman in a hurricane.<eos> You and your crew stay out of the sun.
I gave you a chance.<eos> I said I'd look out for you.<eos> It's more than I gave any one of them Jakes.<eos> Now I'm goin' home to my family.<eos> I think you should turn in, too.
Well,<eos> Miss Fields...<eos> Welcome to Laramie.<eos> Open it up.<eos> You boys is leaving town.
- What lake are we talking about, Marty?<eos> We're not...<eos> We're not talking, Louise.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You've all traveled across the country, exhausted.
Meaning what?<eos> Chick Hogan's a piece of shit.<eos> Three other guys bought guns from him in the last year, and now they're all in prison.<eos> So we're taking the guns, and we didn't bring the money because we planned on blowing Chick Hogan's brains out, but like I said, he's not here.<eos> You are.
Have you come to hear the word of Jesus?<eos> No.<eos> I am Saul.<eos> Scholar, Jew, Roman citizen, pharisee, defender of the great temple of Jerusalem.<eos> I have come to teach you of the wrath you will all bring down upon yourselves if you do not end your blasphemy.
I'm in good with the owner.<eos> Besides, when will you all have time to talk about me?<eos> - # for you # - Okay, she's fantastic.<eos> Why have you been hiding her all this time?<eos> I was afraid you all might scare her off.
- Hi.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - I've heard a lot about you.<eos> - Likewise.<eos> - You two know each other?
!<eos> - Shut the hell up!<eos> - Come on, Davis.<eos> - Sean!<eos> - Listen, you're gonna drop that gun and let me out - or one of you's getting shot.
Looks like you guys are off the hook.<eos> Sorry.<eos> It would be nice if at least one of the Charmings lived up to their family name.<eos> Maybe we should go back to the sheriff's station, check out any security footage of Gold's, make sure they didn't take anything.<eos> Why don't you go ahead?
I remember sleeping, my brothers breathing in unison.<eos> We'd sleepwalk out of bed and pile up in a corner like puppies.<eos> When I was nine, I was made to shoot puppy.<eos> We're just like you, Helena.<eos> You poison women.
I'm due back at work in an hour.<eos> Oh, I had to drop Jenny off at her friend Karen's.<eos> Her mother was running late.<eos> Hi, you.<eos> What are you two up to?
Yeah, last party I didn't even bother eating my own food.<eos> Well, if you stick with me, I won't eat anything and I won't spit in your mouth.<eos> Okay. Promise?<eos> All right.<eos> So, what are you two doing?
My daughter.<eos> She's alive?<eos> Yes.<eos> She survived the journey to this land...<eos> The journey you sent her on.
Yes. D-Do you have that?<eos> No!<eos> 'Cause there's no such thing!<eos> Takes years of training to be an artist. Years!<eos> Look, you're the only real artists I know.
She met my grandpa when they were mascottin' in college.<eos> They looked into each other's big dumb foam eyes, and that was it.<eos> Miss Labonz!<eos> If she sees us, we'll be in big trouble.<eos> What are you two kids doing outside? Uh... What are you doing, Miss L?
I only kissed her.<eos> Well, and I got angry with her, but I didn't do anything to her.<eos> Aritz, you know I should be beating the shit out of you, right?<eos> Esteban, I just tried to get close to you two.<eos> And you both want to get away from me.
If they have a covert lab there making anthrax, that's a lot of real estate.<eos> Sounds like a good place for a furniture warehouse.<eos> No, no, no, change of plans.<eos> Furniture importers are sedentary.<eos> You two need to be mobile.
Or am I being an optimist?<eos> Liv?<eos> Liv?<eos> He's in the stairwell.<eos> You two got to move.
May I ask, as someone who's been witness to the breaking of many a heart... how you can be so sure?<eos> Because he is the only friend I have.<eos> I'm pleased for you.<eos> I'm pleased for both of you.<eos> Had you two met before?
You make me sick.<eos> You know, when you were dying, we all loved you.<eos> Now you're my least favorite person in the office.<eos> You're no one to me!<eos> You know what?
All right, students!<eos> You have ten seconds to disperse.<eos> After that, everyone here will receive Saturday detention for a month.<eos> Is he for real?<eos> I know you all hate these new rules.
Gabriel, I know how these things go.<eos> What's the alternative if it's not Martha?<eos> Does The Centre have someone else inside the FBI who could switch out the tapes?<eos> There are janitors, mailroom clerks who can gain access.<eos> We don't want to risk the Martha operation any more than you do.
Which is critical, because in our line of work we don't often have the luxury of certainty.<eos> - What are you really saying?<eos> - We don't see eye to eye.<eos> - We share the same objective.<eos> - Your mission is to supply resistance; you blow up a bridge.
It's not just that.<eos> He used to be so sweet and considerate.<eos> Now, it's like he barely knows I exist.<eos> You just hit a bump in the road.<eos> You two are good together.
Listen...<eos> Run!<eos> Connie!<eos> Sweets.<eos> You two take the front of the house, I'm going around back.
I was with Rusham the whole time.<eos> He didn't go anywhere near the rover.<eos> And neither did Angela.<eos> And that's what makes this crime so clever.<eos> From the beginning, the three of you have been able to alibi each other out because you were all in on it together.
- Is she sad about something?<eos> Yeah, she's very sad.<eos> She wishes your brother James would be a better student.<eos> that's not what she's upset about, and you know it.<eos> All right, you two, do me a favor, have a wonderful day at school.
I can give you a few templates, help get you started.<eos> Yeah, that'd be great.<eos> I got to pee.<eos> Ladies' room is right down that hall.<eos> And how are you two doing?
- How do we know it's even her?<eos> - Lena.<eos> Haven't you heard of identity theft?<eos> Don't be ridiculous.<eos> You're being ridiculous for believing that there's any way that this could be Camille.
According to the Far Horizon's medical logs, no one has ever had a successful immune response to the virus before.<eos> Exactly.<eos> But that doesn't change the fact that the virus is no longer present.<eos> There is no threat.<eos> Look, guys, I can't explain it any better than you can.
What happened to all them smart comments?<eos> Just dried right up, huh?<eos> She actually tried to ice her own boyfriend just to cut him out of the score.<eos> We're guessing she'll roll over pretty easily on her fence.<eos> So, um, I gather the takeaway is you're offering me a chance to screw Emma over before she screws me.
Once we're on Sangolo, nothing else will matter ever again.<eos> Watch your step on the way down, folks.<eos> Greetings, all.<eos> Welcome to the first day of your brand-new lives.<eos> Now, you lucky folks are the first to visit our brand-new campus.
So their life isn't even good.<eos> They don't like anything.<eos> Their whole life is, ugh, Jesus!<eos> If there's any joy for them, it's that this is now bothering other people.<eos> "Yeah, you listen to this shit now!"
"of your pubic hair to your ex-wife's mother?"<eos> That's how you want to break the silence of six years since the divorce.<eos> "This is my pubic hair.<eos> "Look at all of my pubic hair.<eos> How have you been?"
Maybe I should go out there and hold him back.<eos> Nah, I don't think so.<eos> Aw, big papa bear Bobby looking out for his cubs. You get 'em.<eos> I'm just glad this nightmare on Logan Street is over.<eos> There's got to be something we can do that will make you happy, make me happy, make your essay happy.
- Diaz.<eos> Look what I found in Hitchcock and Scully's trash can:<eos> ice cream spoon.<eos> - Son of a bitch.<eos> You hungry, hungry hippos ate my ice cream.
- Me too.<eos> I'm super lactose intolerant.<eos> - You're lying.<eos> - Have you ever seen us eat dairy?<eos> - You know no one can bear to watch you eat.
Yeah, well, we are also very close.<eos> One time, Rosa saw me in my bathing suit.<eos> No, I didn't, you told me to turn around. - Yeah.<eos> - Well, uh, since we cannot eat your disgusting street food, could you please check if our prisoner has been processed?<eos> Yeah, we don't mean to offend, it's just this place is filthy and you both seem unprofessional.
Oh, hello!<eos> Yes, I am allergic to dust.<eos> Everyone is.<eos> That's what sneezes are.<eos> You're what sneezes are.
You're what sneezes are.<eos> Okay.<eos> What are you guys doing here?<eos> Oh, in Sweden, we call it police work.<eos> Perhaps you don't have a word for it? - I hate you.
A little piece of evidence that evaded your bald little hands.<eos> A shipping manifest that was shoved into the back of a drawer.<eos> Our perp transferred a container to a shipyard in Bay Ridge on October 11th.<eos> That arrived over a month ago, I doubt you'll find anything in it.<eos> Please, you're just pissed we cracked the case wide open and you've got nada.
If you already know everything, what do you want?<eos> Tell us what you saw in that fire.<eos> In your statement you said you saw an unconscious man dressed like a Napoleon's soldier.<eos> What does it matter, if you don't believe me?<eos> You two aren't psychiatrists.
We go back to the Ministry.<eos> It's going to be a massacre, for nothing.<eos> France will lose the war. and that will only be the beginning of the end of the revolutionary dream<eos> No one wins.<eos> You will lose everything and we will go back to absolutism, to darkness.
It means shut the hell up.<eos> Took a while for the gas to clear out of here.<eos> Eh buddy, would you mind telling us what this is about?<eos> I'd be happy to answer all your questions.<eos> Just as soon as you answer a couple of mine.
What you're doing on board this ship, that's all. Right, because they're expecting a team of hardened criminals, Not some little girl who's just along for the ride.<eos> You are not some little girl just along for the ride.<eos> Tell that to six.<eos> Remember to breathe.<eos> So, are you two like, brother and sister, or what?
We've got to make a plan, while we can still think straight.<eos> Hey, don't everybody talk at once.<eos> We're supposed to be good at this sort of thing.<eos> Some of us are, anyway. Hey! Huh.<eos> I'm in this as much as you are.
You think you could do it in the moment? Hmm?<eos> Send your brother or your sister off to the chair?<eos> Maybe even kill them yourself?<eos> To save my friends or you, yes.<eos> They are my blood, but you and Zayday and even the Chanels, all of the people who I have suffered through all of this with, you are my family.
Gimme.<eos> Here.<eos> I don't know how you're hungry in this situation.<eos> I am not hungry, but a good soldier must feed himself even if he is not hungry.<eos> You should eat something too.
-Yes, an angel has passed by.<eos> It's shit on your fucking mother.<eos> This one needs a good punch in the face.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Who are you?
(Bells tolling)<eos> Where were you?<eos> - We went outside in case our companions came.<eos> If they haven't returned from France then they are dead.<eos> Just like you will be if you don't leave now.
A new mission awaits us.<eos> Victory or death.<eos> I prefer the first one.<eos> Me too.<eos> You two go and see the Prior.
Just what we needed.<eos> The king of Castile stays in Castile.<eos> Tell me who you work for.<eos> This jail is inhumane.<eos> Don't complain, you all have Guant√°namo.
‚ô™ In this whole... damn... town!<eos> ‚ô™ Hyah! You guys cost me my chance with a woman of a certain age!<eos> Hey, come on, all is not lost.<eos> This coaster's fine.<eos> You are not my friends.
Do none of you practice what you preach?<eos> It's not that easy!<eos> Isn't it?<eos> !<eos> You all bicker and prattle like children when inside each of you is the greatest gift!
- Just out.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> Do you remember me?<eos> Abby Whelan?<eos> A gladiator since... oh, I don't know... long before you ever were.
I learn more about the craft and about songwriting, and, Dad, I'm taking you to see a shrink.<eos> No, no, honey, I‚ÄìI'm not‚Äì I don't have to‚Äì<eos> Oh, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> We need to solve my dad's psychological problems so he stops screwing us up.<eos> And you all are coming into the sessions.
Honey, we... we just have some stuff that we need to work through.<eos> But we love each other very much.<eos> And, uh... we hope everything will go back to normal, really soon.<eos> Are we moving?<eos> No, you are staying here.
Grant, this is my friend Patricia.<eos> This is my grandson, Grant.<eos> Hello, Grant.<eos> Lovely to meet you.<eos> Would you two care to join me?
Tucker, hi.<eos> Oh my gosh, I am so sorry about sondra.<eos> Was she upset?<eos> Not when she left.<eos> You and you have ruined my life!
This is important to me. Can you not see how moist my forehead is?<eos> - Tucker!<eos> - Oh my God!<eos> What did I tell you about that word?<eos> You must be Riley and Ben.
- What should I tell them?<eos> - Tell 'em to follow orders!<eos> These boys have maybe... maybe one battle in 'em.<eos> If it comes at the wrong time, we all die.<eos> You men are in charge while I'm gone.
What do you need this for?<eos> Let me introduce Daphne and her equally pretty sister Penelope.<eos> Alright then let's see how fast we can get one of them sisters ready.<eos> There was a shooting.<eos> And you gonna tell me you are all just innocent bystanders?
It's best we just head out to meet up with Houston's army.<eos> Huh... right after we settle up in Victoria.<eos> I'll bet you boys come from Buckley's way station.<eos> There was a shooting.<eos> And you gonna tell me you're all just innocent bystanders.
That's the reason that-- [stammering]<eos> It's okay.<eos> You know, it's so funny, Blake, but I never knew you were in a band.<eos> Yeah, and it's "rapping wizards." Wow.<eos> I mean, even it it isn't good, you know, it'll be fun to laugh at.
[laughing] That was so fun.<eos> I'm sorry, what the hell are you doing here?<eos> He's jamming with his friends, which, last time I checked, ain't a crime.<eos> Actually, the last time I checked, he's not supposed to be here, so you know what?<eos> Neither should you.
Over there. Yes, cows!<eos> I'm counting four cows.<eos> That is a start.<eos> Get 'em, round 'em up.<eos> You two take the flanks, I'll stay at the rear.
I never said I was.<eos> You're going to join me, won't you, Sister?<eos> If I do, you will talk to us, answer our questions?<eos> Sure.<eos> If you answer mine.
Is this true?<eos> In the Italian Wars.<eos> Wars we fought for the House of Valois.<eos> You stabbed him in the back, you coward.<eos> You are the murderers.
Thanks.<eos> You know...<eos> I got a thing for drummers. Whew. Got to hand it to you, Marco, decent performance.<eos> Could have stuck to the script, but not bad.<eos> I helped you, now you help me.
do you and your partner not understand?<eos> We just got this email to Major Crimes directed to Detective Wells from the medical examiner's office regarding a certain Michael Liu. What's that?<eos> We're not trying to muscle in on the feds, but these homicides are related.<eos> All right, I hear you, but you know what?<eos> You two have lived up to the hype, but listen to me, I'm here to support you.
~ Oh, Christ!<eos> ~ Jesus!<eos> Oh, you need to go home.<eos> But I'm your Maid of Honour.<eos> Why don't you both go in?
They're really embarrassing.<eos> Well, since you're going to time prison, I'd say you can keep them on forever.<eos> - Time prison?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Well, I don't know where you expect me to think you got that crystal over there, but the only way your dumbass assin' ass asses could ever have one is if it was stolen.
It's my neighbor... who I live with.<eos> What the...<eos> You can't be like everyone else!<eos> I mean...<eos> - Do you see each...
I'll take care of it.<eos> - And I'll help him out.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Me and Uncle Red got it.<eos> Oh, so you're gonna take care of it.
But they must be teenagers by now.<eos> - James just turned 13, all right?<eos> - Shame on you.<eos> Terry, what are you still doing there?<eos> According to Vince, you two have been doing very well lately.
By the way, this is the first time I'm hearing that she's unhappy with the apartment.<eos> - I mean, all these years, baby. I thought you loved the place.<eos> - Mm, I love it.<eos> You two should come out to Carroll Gardens and take a look at our place.<eos> If Vince can afford a house out there, I don't see why you couldn't, as well.
Thank you.<eos> So that's why we started going to story time at the Kwik-E-Mart.<eos> Remember when Apu let Dad have the expired hot dogs?<eos> Just once, and I'm still taking medication for it.<eos> So many photos of you kids fighting.
Mr. Burns:<eos> A Post-Electric Play, and Chappie.<eos> Sir, the movie's been over for 20 minutes.<eos> You'll have to clear out of the theater and come back for the next show. D'oh!<eos> So, you are the best America could send to stop Sheik Abu Nadal Abdul
See, if it said "Taylor Swift," it would be a different story.<eos> Mm. Yeah, all right.<eos> Well, I... I did my best.<eos> Tried all my tricks, but you guys made your choices, so take care of our kid, surrogate mama.<eos> (Ava) Aw, I will, real mama, yeah. Ah, ha, ha. I will see you chumps later, and you still think I'm a bitch?
[laughs] Yeah, right.<eos> You guys are getting all the publishing between the two of you, right?<eos> Gigi's getting paid extra for singing and everything.<eos> The... the two of us are basically left over as hired employees.<eos> You two are paid employees.
- No Donal.<eos> - No.<eos> Liam?<eos> Let me explain something to you, okay?<eos> You're proving the theory that nobody, including you, gives a shit who "the engine" is in U2, okay?
And I wasn't worried.<eos> It wasn't until I got a call from the medical school, and she hadn't been in classes for several days.<eos> And I thought, "I've got to do something."<eos> I went and I talked to my father and my brother Douglas, and they all said,<eos> "You know, you two have been having "all these arguments all these years.
It wouldn't have happened, would it?<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Don't be, don't be.<eos> It was him, he was an evil fucker and I'm sorry I didn't do anything about it.<eos> Mum, I swear to God, if you don't shut the fuck up, saying stuff like that about my dad, I swear I'll have nothing to do with all of ya!
His brother and sister-in-law died six years ago-- car crash.<eos> Shah took in their son Naveed.<eos> We arrested Naveed... in a sting operation last year.<eos> He walked into his high school wearing a dummy suicide vest.<eos> That you provided him.
In people's utterly fucked memories.<eos> We'll get there, guv.<eos> Dad?<eos> - All right?<eos> - Yeah, fine. Y-You OK?
This was a mistake.<eos> Just hold it together.<eos> We just need that name, and then we're out of here.<eos> Change of plans.<eos> Before I help you, you two are gonna help me with something.
After what you've done?<eos> You ruined lives.<eos> You've taken our future.<eos> Everyone that you went after had people who depended on them!<eos> You stole 20 years of my life, my daughter's childhood, and you tried to end me.
Fire in the water?<eos> You just decided to stay.<eos> The baby stopped crying.<eos> So, when I say "Move", you move.<eos> When I say "Jump", you say "How high?"
Excuse me.<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> Hey. Where's Mike?<eos> He wa... he was just here.<eos> You two check the service corridors.
My patient today had a terrible injury.<eos> The very best person to treat that injury was Catherine Avery.<eos> Now, I don't know what personal stuff is going on between the two of you exactly, but whatever it is,<eos> I will not allow it to compromise my patient, his care, or his penis!<eos> And for what it's worth, I think you two are good together!
Yes.<eos> But Cond√© was last sighted in Toulouse, which is east of St. Serafina's.<eos> If he was approaching our last position, he would have been heading west, wouldn't he?<eos> Perhaps the scout was confused.<eos> You also seem confused.
You missed that?<eos> That's it?<eos> Probably.<eos> You need to keep us updated going forward.<eos> And you do the same.
Answer the question.<eos> Who are you?<eos> I'm Christine Price and this is my friend Eva.<eos> Excuse me, I need some air.<eos> And you all know each other?
What?<eos> Junior and Eva... they're going to kill Hunter.<eos> - You got to get him out of here.<eos> - How?<eos> You found me.
Did Junior and Eva send you?<eos> Are you a part of the kinship?<eos> No.<eos> Not after what they did to Abby.<eos> And I take it from the fact that you have someone in the freezer you're not part of the kinship, either.
She was trapped.<eos> She made us leave her behind.<eos> We barely got out before the tunnels collapsed.<eos> My mom sacrificed herself so that her child could live, and there's nothing more human than that.<eos> You set off those bombs, didn't you?
That we wanted to travel hundreds of thousands of light-years through a cold, harsh vacuum, that we wanted to leave our home, our history behind.<eos> Earth is a wonderful place, but it's not that great.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> Because we had no choice.<eos> And now, neither do you.
He tried to sell out Dad, it didn't work, and he took the easy way out.<eos> Whatever happened between him and Dad doesn't negate the fact that he always wanted what's best for us, Jamal.<eos> He taught me that it was my responsibility, as the oldest, to always look out for you guys, to protect you.<eos> Instead, I made sure you were at each others throats.<eos> I wanted Empire so bad that I... I was prepared to let you two kill each other so I'd be the only one left.
That's my calling.<eos> That's my truth.<eos> Okay, so should we clock in or something?<eos> No, we definitely shouldn't clock in, okay?<eos> I should clock in, because this is my job and you don't belong here.
Meyer Lansky is overseeing an aggressive plan to expand the Luciano empire outside the United States.<eos> It's nice being close to the sea.<eos> We have the same thing in New York,<eos> - but it's nothing like this.<eos> - You have Coney Island.
Yes, Simon.<eos> Go ahead. I wanted to be the best.<eos> Great, yes!<eos> Me too! I wanted to be the best.<eos> And I want you to want to be the best.
Run, you fuckwit, fucking run!<eos> Everyone else, situational awareness training in 15 minutes.<eos> Situational awareness!<eos> Brilliant!<eos> I'll count to 100 and you all go and hide.
See...he's still washing everyone's clothes.<eos> Ramlal!<eos> Hey Ramlal?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> What are you two doing?
- But how can I say yes.<eos> Why not?<eos> Why not? You two are already a match made in heaven.<eos> Us?<eos> You two are sailing in the same boat.
The dates work.<eos> And the girl said her father works in a bank.<eos> Right.<eos> We'll check the bank and the bowling alley.<eos> You do the pubs.
Didn't hear you coming.<eos> Yep, I know.<eos> I like it like that.<eos> Listen, I appreciate your coming in out of the cold like this.<eos> And I want you to know, I wouldn't have reached out to you except it was somebody in the brotherhood.
What if I were to tell you that we have a copy of this email?<eos> - I'd tell you it's a fake.<eos> - Well, we can verify it.<eos> Harrison.<eos> You people have no sense of decency.
Well, no, it's called stasis, actually.<eos> They're preserving energy.<eos> I hope you didn't disturb them.<eos> Why did you take Pete?<eos> Well, Pete was here, you weren't.
The anticipation is killing me.<eos> See, here's your Petey.<eos> Safe and sound.<eos> Early in our occupation of this facility, we were attacked by Rhais, a higher angel, one of Gabriel's lieutenants.<eos> And she would have wiped us out but for a nest of what you call eight-balls hiding in these tunnels.
Thousands of people to follow you, believe in you.<eos> God isn't here, Zoe, so you need to lead them.<eos> Choice is yours.<eos> You want to go on thinking small, kill me now.<eos> 'Cause you two are dead.
Where the hell is she taking us?<eos> I think the point is that we don't know.<eos> Or she's just about to off us.<eos> You'd get no warning if I was gonna off you, Mr. Walsh.<eos> You've all been through hell.
Uh, wait, but isn't she supposed to already be dead?<eos> Isn't that how this works?<eos> Uh, the parents must blame her for Jin's suicide.<eos> They're determined to make An Bai his bride, if not in life, then in death.<eos> You two head to An Bai's.
Stop!<eos> Get in the car.<eos> Go.<eos> I've scrambled the local P.D. to An Bai's house.<eos> They should get there before you do.
She should be buried in Chicago, near her husband.<eos> Dad, he's Jewish, and it's customary for him to eat her heart.<eos> He'll go to hell if he doesn't.<eos> She is staying here.<eos> And now, so will you, in a Puerto Rican prison.
He threw himself out a fifth story window right here in this building.<eos> You mean you threw him out the window.<eos> He jumped.<eos> That is a fact.<eos> You killed him.
I need to drive this into the door to lock it, - but the truck won't move. See?<eos> I can see it.<eos> There's something wedged underneath.<eos> Come on, move!<eos> You must be with Jamie.
Good morning to you, too.<eos> Oh, relax, Jenna.<eos> We know you're sexually active.<eos> We were just sleeping, Mom.<eos> Anyway, we're cool with you having sex in our house because you're both practically adults.
Damn it.<eos> Laps. Okay. Gonna need a whole lot more laps!<eos> Doctors hunt and Kepner start Keith's surgery outside in the car.<eos> Doctors Grey and Pierce are standing by in the O.R. waiting to finish that surgery.<eos> You need to help get Keith from the car to the O.R.
What can I tell you?<eos> There's not much difference between us and those wretches.<eos> Think about it, we are lacking something too.<eos> Maybe not an arm or a leg... but sometimes it's worse not to have any hope or dreams.<eos> So, if you are hungry like those poor wretches, then take my advice... give Jesus a try.
Hold him.<eos> Cos this oil will make you shit them out.<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> You two stay here.
It means they haven't found him.<eos> If an army can't find him, what chance do we stand?<eos> We should split into two groups.<eos> Be more methodical.<eos> You two go east, follow the river.
That's amazing.<eos> Congratulations again.<eos> Just...wow.<eos> Guess what!<eos> You coming with me, too!
Go on, then!<eos> Hang me!<eos> Hang me!<eos> Done died on those stocks years ago.<eos> You all, so busy looking for where the evil came from.
We'll leave you to it.<eos> Who are you?<eos> W-what is this?<eos> What is S.H.I.E.L.D.?<eos> Did you do this to me?
Well, our research shows that you have The greatest name recognition with men and women Ages 40 to 65.<eos> -Great.<eos> -And within that group, We'd go after professionals with leisure time.<eos> That's your branding target.<eos> So with that in mind, here are a few products That we think you would be perfect for.
Memorize them.<eos> Can anybody name...<eos> So, you might be thinking...<eos> Rule number five...<eos> When I move, you move.
I--<eos> - Shoo! - Yes.<eos> What a great family.<eos> You know what?<eos> I wasn't gonna mention this, but I have a very lucrative, no-fail investment opportunity that I think you all might be interested in.
Okay.<eos> - And so we're done here. - Uh-huh.<eos> You know, we love the way you walk away.<eos> You should aim for the exit.<eos> You're the Sarkissians.
First, release our leader Terry Colby from your illegitimate prison immediately.<eos> Second, release all the people of the world from your even more illegitimate prisons of debt.<eos> Third, dissolve your corporation and donate all your assets to charities around the world.<eos> This proposal is non-negotiable.<eos> The people are realizing they don't have freedom of choice so long as you exist.
Then I'll ask a favor of the Chief Deputy U.S. Marshal in L.A. and have his boys grab him.<eos> Callen has to be stopped.<eos> You can't expect us to bring in one of our own.<eos> There's no way Hetty approved of this.<eos> Listen, she doesn't like it any more than you or I do, but Callen hasn't exactly left us any other option.
It's what he's gonna do with the information that concerns us.<eos> You don't know what he's gonna do.<eos> Yeah, maybe he's gonna send Arkady a postcard or a cake with a file in it.<eos> He's ignored all of our requests to report in.<eos> What would you do?
I think we left ‚Ä≠the brownies in the car.<eos> - Oh, I'll get those.<eos> - Well, way to go, pal.<eos> Okay, what is wrong with you people?<eos> I am dying here, ‚Ä≠trying to hold down two jobs while you enable a once-proud man who is clearly having a talent-free breakdown.
I don't like lamb.<eos> There you go.<eos> I'm going nowhere.<eos> Oh, River.<eos> You go on.
One of you men... Go dig a grave for that man.<eos> That's a reb sniper!<eos> He's a boy!<eos> Not much older than some of you.<eos> Fighting for what he believes in... just like you are.
What does the doctor in you say?<eos> Somebody have a knife? Hold it! Put pressure on the wound right here.<eos> That's about all I can do.<eos> But I need a field hospital.<eos> You do have a field hospital?
I just had to hang on in there for a bit.<eos> How long?<eos> It was fine.<eos> One question.<eos> And you will answer.
[Chuckles] You know?<eos> Are you sure this is what you want to do?<eos> You gave away an awful lot of good business today.<eos> It's the only choice I have, Finbar.<eos> You're the ones that are gonna have the problem.
Just keep on breathing, okay?<eos> I've been wanting to... get closer to you?<eos> - Well, hey there!<eos> - Hello.<eos> So are you two together or...?
I'd love some lunch.<eos> Thank you.<eos> There's three assorted nuts.<eos> This isn't a restaurant.<eos> How do you two know each other, again?
Give it here.<eos> You carried Da's ax last ride.<eos> Yeah, because you don't have the arm to swing it, puny-kin.<eos> Says you, you fat elf.<eos> Will you two ever grow up?
Get out of here.<eos> Fuck you.<eos> You know what, Sarah?<eos> I am a beautiful soul.<eos> And you are all... monsters.
- Yeah.<eos> - ...how crazy I am!<eos> It's just...<eos> Well, I am not crazy!<eos> You're crazy!
To comfort murderers with provisions is a breach of law.<eos> You must have some concerns for their welfare to risk serving your own time in the coffin.<eos> They are not murderers.<eos> I decide what they are.<eos> You deliver the pain of that decision.
She told me that some of the knights made vile and lustful advances towards her.<eos> And you, overcome with jealous rage, threatened to take vengeance.<eos> She begs that I confine you until your proper mind can be restored.<eos> It is time for us to be true, gentlemen.<eos> I know who you and your friends are.
They'd have to know who you were to him.<eos> They won't acknowledge me.<eos> Okay, I'm gonna do you a favor...<eos> And not contact his family, because it's not gonna do you any good.<eos> Okay, Jeff's gone, he's not coming back, and the best way for you to get over him is to just pretend that the two of you never happened.
DITU watches what happens online as it happens, making it the most powerful surveillance tool you've never heard of.<eos> If somebody posts a manifesto against the President, a DITU agent will be the one who sends the I.P. address to Secret Service.<eos> Now, technology changes, so do surveillance methods.<eos> However, one thing will always remain the same.<eos> You don't know we're watching.
This time, you will be surveilling... me.<eos> We're looking into you?<eos> But we know you.<eos> You think you know me.<eos> You only know who I am inside this building.
How do you live with something like that inside you?<eos> I have to take this.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> - ‚ô™ Walk through the field ‚ô™ - Yeah, sure.<eos> We have a perspective that you don't have.
- No, sorry.<eos> I gotta give the dog his shots while my wife's on a date.<eos> At least she's letting me in the house.<eos> [sighs] Mindy, Morgan.<eos> You love free slop.
Huge, bro.<eos> Here's to getting home after the kids are bathed and asleep.<eos> - Cheers. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> Are you dudes for real?<eos> You two would have rather stay out here and drink than go home and be with your babies?
Check it out on the internal employee website, which if you're watching this you probably already have 'cause it's the only place it's posted.<eos> [chuckles] Anyway, um... I want you to know that my door is always open.<eos> My mind is always open.<eos> Basically I just want things to be really open around here.<eos> I believe in complete transparency, and I hope you do too.
Gotta say, I was surprised to hear from you.<eos> Figured you were still sore about Nairobi.<eos> You almost got us killed in Nairobi.<eos> Hell, those poachers were bad men.<eos> And you were on the right side of right.
Like this?<eos> Are they having sex?<eos> I'm not certain.<eos> But I'm glad there are no children present.<eos> Why are you both here, anyway?
- Hi.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Um, regarding Wacky Hair Day.<eos> The thing is, kids are naturally anxious about their appearance just really on any given day, so to disrupt the routine, you know, a routine that some of us are barely hanging on to just to get them dressed and out the door and get the snack made<eos> and get the lunch made and get the sunscreen on and get them in the car and get them here on time, and then you, kind of, add this, um, lunatic wacky hair wrench into the works...
- Patrizia.<eos> My brother's Gilberto, my grandmother is Luciana, I live in Piazza Caprera.<eos> I'm just fine, believe me.<eos> - How old are you? - Forty-two.<eos> I came back to the past, you see me as 18.
Disappeared again.<eos> I passed him in the woods.<eos> Heading south toward town.<eos> Well I'm gonna find out where he keeps disappearing to.<eos> And you two see if you can't get that baby away from Murphy.
No.<eos> No.<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> Everyone knew she was at Abu Omar's. Hmm.<eos> Everyone knew his brother was visiting and you would all be at a huge dinner in his honor.
Can we taste it?<eos> Oh, would you like me to just show you my naked body before we go out to dinner and you want to sleep with me?<eos> I need to go to the restroom.<eos> [normal voice] Okay, so here's what's gonna happen.<eos> She's gonna want to drop me, and you're gonna drop The Plaza Hotel.
50.<eos> At 4 1/2.<eos> 50 at 4 1/2 is 225, man.<eos> 250K if the guns are in my hands by tomorrow night.<eos> You bring the money, homes, we'll be here.
Look at me!<eos> This is happening.<eos> All you gotta do is let it.<eos> Now you keep your ass right here, and don't you move. ‚ô™ ‚ô™ All right, boys, as far as busts go, this one should be pretty painless.<eos> TAC, you're going to set up here.
You know that.<eos> What that man did to you... What he did to us... Is on completely different levels.<eos> Cyrus, come on.<eos> He was my husband.<eos> You were just colleagues, friends.
Reality doesn't just happen.<eos> Unless you think I make it up all on my own.<eos> Well, if anyone could, I'm sure it would be you.<eos> The writer guides us in the situations to stir up drama.<eos> And whatever the show suggests, you go along with...
Until today.<eos> Here's a check from the During Foundation for $10 million.<eos> And...<eos> And this... This is just the start.<eos> Because I call on my fellow businessmen, on governments, on aid organizations, to fulfill this promise, so that on the day when peace comes, you, the people of Alladia, can go home and rebuild your country with pride
I know how much it means to you to have her there.<eos> Thank you, Ash.<eos> I find the easiest way to manoeuvre her is to steer her by the hump.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> What are you both doing here?
We're here for the wedding.<eos> But it's not for another nine hours.<eos> I see.<eos> We'll just wait then.<eos> Well, you two really managed to suck the life out of the room.
All of us, we're just soldiers.<eos> Marwan is right.<eos> 30 seconds!<eos> Look, if God is willing for us to survive this, we need a leader.<eos> You'll lead yourselves.
He's a good man.<eos> But I must think of my kingdom first.<eos> That's Arthur's tent.<eos> I'll go in first.<eos> You two stand guard.
Quite the prestigious organization responsible for countless wars, numerous plagues, assassinations.<eos> You have to break rules if you want to build a new world.<eos> Hello, Elijah.<eos> It's been a while.<eos> You two know each other.
Look, I know all about you and Riley.<eos> She told me everything.<eos> Sorry, dude.<eos> I'm a tough act to follow.<eos> But she seems to think that you two are just friends now.
No one brought her here.<eos> When she was young, we used to rent a cabin up in Maple Canyon.<eos> Caught trout and cook them on the skewer.<eos> I just have a feeling she's there somewhere.<eos> Ari, you follow us, just in case of trouble.
Dance has become a god!<eos> And Lord Trash will rise again!<eos> Let me out of here!<eos> Let me out of here!<eos> You two cover us!
Apparently it's a very rare dialect, called Wenzhou.<eos> The Chinese call it the devil's language.<eos> The devil's language?<eos> I can tr... I can translate.<eos> I wanna stop this guy as much as you do.
You try another attack now, you'll all be arrested or imprisoned, this time for life.<eos> Unless... getting arrested is the point.<eos> The real jihad is in Syria.<eos> But there you'd have to fight.<eos> Look, I understand you not wanting to go is all I'm saying.
- Fine.<eos> Then I will take you back to Dar Adal now, before you cause an international incident.<eos> Well, there's something you need to know first.<eos> If your little escapade gets out, it's an embarrassment for both our countries.<eos> Right now my agency is working very hard to prove that you murdered General Youssef and his family.
Ric lied to you.<eos> I just kept my mouth shut.<eos> Wait. I'm not gonna be stuck in the middle of this.<eos> No, no.<eos> You sort this out.
I said, let him go. Aagh! Uh...<eos> I want to talk about death.<eos> More specifically, I want to talk about what happens after.<eos> Now, I'm not going to pretend like my good looks are the reason this class is so full.<eos> I've heard the same stories you have about Mystic Falls...
She merely abandoned her relatives.<eos> There's a difference.<eos> Yeah.<eos> One is a permanent blood tie, a name, a legacy.<eos> Well, in her eyes, Malcolm was more a Salvatore than you ever were.
I couldn't... I couldn't stop him.<eos> Julian beat me savagely and... when it was finally over, my baby was dead.<eos> Murdering my child wasn't just some violent whim.<eos> It was a calculated, manipulative act.<eos> What are you boys doing here?
- Diver!<eos> - Get your hands off me, man! - Karen:<eos> Hey!<eos> - Hey, stop!<eos> Then what are you two doing here? Huh? - Karen?
Crocodile had more chances than anyone.<eos> And right now we need to give Emma her best chance, which means contacting Merlin.<eos> And something bad happens to Rumple...<eos> It's a risk we'll have to take.<eos> Mm, well, maybe you're willing to.
My apologies, they didn't tell me you were disabled.<eos> Your Majesty, I seem to have forgotten my manners.<eos> Yes, and for the second time today.<eos> Gentlemen, I look forward to seeing you all soon.<eos> And let's be honest, not near as much as you look forward to seeing me.
Everything else.<eos> I see.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> I don't see at all.<eos> Well, what did you two talk about?
Okay, so, uh... who... who are we meeting, Mom and Dad?<eos> Well, yeah, Pappy, but I guess you can call him Pastor Gene<eos> - or just Gene, you know.<eos> - Okay.<eos> And I call Mama "Mama," but you can call her Blossie,
Everyone, please welcome April Carver.<eos> Thank you all for coming here today.<eos> Leo wanted this camp to be something special...<eos> And I think, if you look around you'll see his wish came true.<eos> He believed in adventure, and I hope you all have a lot of them here.
I'm working my way up to Supreme Leader of the Planet.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> Dan.<eos> Dan Scully.<eos> And I bet you don't believe any of this alien exodus crap either do you?
That's what happens when you haven't had a decent cup of coffee in half a decade.<eos> Citizen Z. This is your old pal.<eos> Addison Carver.<eos> Do you copy?<eos> Where the hell do you dudes keep coming from?
They're only after you.<eos> They're a manifestation of your disease.<eos> You destroy everything you come into contact with.<eos> These creatures aren't the plague that can kill us.<eos> You are.
Let us go!<eos> You'll never see us again!<eos> You got that right.<eos> Look.<eos> You and I both know what happens if I let you go.
Is that not enough?<eos> Well, take more.<eos> It's only money.<eos> It's against the law... sir.<eos> You people are funny about your laws, aren't you?
Yes, as are you.<eos> You took a big risk for us.<eos> Thank you.<eos> May I ask why?<eos> We hate the Votanis Collective as much as you do.
The Lion Guard needs to stick together!<eos> Was it something I said?<eos> Janja, I'm hungry!<eos> Me, too!<eos> You two only have yourselves to blame.
Put that one there too.<eos> - This?<eos> - Throw it out.<eos> Throw it all out.<eos> Do what you damn want, but don't ask me.
We have visual confirmation at the airport.<eos> We can't even be sure what your friend saw was accurate.<eos> I trust my friend, just like I trust you.<eos> New plan.<eos> You take the airport, I've got the train.
- ...<eos> Pump up the music... - And get out of that uniform.<eos> - What is... what is this?<eos> Y'all uncomfortable yet?<eos> Because that's how you almost made me feel.
Clever.<eos> What's this?<eos> The future.<eos> Welcome to Mexico.<eos> It's a great privilege for you to see this place.
I thought they were gonna kill you.<eos> Glad they didn't.<eos> Now I can do it myself.<eos> Warren.<eos> You two know each other?
You're making so much progress that I knew you wouldn't continue to see me if you knew that Rosie and I were dating, so I ended things with him so we could continue working together.<eos> Right.<eos> Because broken-up couples often stand around with their tongues down each other's throats.<eos> I didn't even know that you were seeing Kat, but why is that a problem?<eos> You two must've had a really good laugh at my expense, laying in bed, marveling over how screwed up I am.
Coming?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Anytime.<eos> Never again.<eos> You two always worked more smoothly with a little lubricant... Dopamine, opioids.
You're looking at it.<eos> So you would remove the buffet when we perform?<eos> No, you perform during the buffet.<eos> It's dinner theater...<eos> They eat, you sing.
Previously on "Rosewood"...<eos> Thank you for not giving up on me weeks ago.<eos> You two must have a really good laugh at my expense.
I assumed that it was Isabel's garbage or the river's garbage.<eos> What if it had been filled with ice?<eos> The weight of which could've been used to hold down the accelerator.<eos> And the proof would have melted in the water before we found it.<eos> That's what I was going to say, but it's fine that you said it out loud.
You know what else is really irritating?<eos> How needy he is with them.<eos> Let me in. What up, bro?<eos> The neighbors are complaining.<eos> I give you guys respect, and you give me nothing.
Now, the way I see it, there are three options.<eos> One, I get... an abortion.<eos> Two, in the next month or so, I find someone.<eos> Let's say, a Russian oligarch.<eos> I, uh, sleep with him, tell him the baby's his, we settle in Russia, and you both get to say good-bye to me forever.
Mia! Aah! Did I do okay?<eos> You did perfectly!<eos> I give up.<eos> How the hell did the two of you trap Liam in his own trunk?<eos> Because we're awesome and you two suck.
The one that he put there, not the...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Detectives, please.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You two depend on each other for your lives out there.
This is his wife, Pamela.<eos> We're just hearing about how Lacy was in love with Rick.<eos> Yeah, so, uh...<eos> You know, last night she, uh...<eos> She kinda made a move, you know.
- That's right.<eos> We're here to help.<eos> We have the resources.<eos> You don't know the streets like we do.<eos> And we don't have targets on our backs like you do.
Can I have a cup of coffee?<eos> Or a hard slap in the face?<eos> No. And why are you all yawning so much?<eos> Why are you yawning?<eos> Because you were yawning, so I... I... just yawned.
When you brought Paul in for questioning, you didn't get all of his devices.<eos> I copied the hard drive of Paul's laptop.<eos> But it's been encrypted.<eos> My team can't crack it.<eos> You can.
She's still out.<eos> ...speech and language issues, vision loss.<eos> Pressure's good, but we won't know.<eos> Or she could just be in a coma.<eos> You people are extraordinary.
...speech and language issues, vision loss.<eos> Pressure's good, but we won't know.<eos> Or she could just be in a coma.<eos> You people are extraordinary.<eos> I mean, I came in here today and did all kinds of things wrong, but in spite of that, you all still did amazing and perfect work.
Yeah!<eos> It's really him.<eos> I want you to go in there.<eos> Why me?<eos> You have the relationship.
He can get past any security system.<eos> He just slips in and out, like every lady in my life.<eos> Been tracking him for weeks.<eos> Near impossible... near.<eos> Which is why you're gonna be working closely with Butters on this to bring this guy in.
And will that be going in Elizabeth's transcript?<eos> It will not.<eos> Let me be clear.<eos> Your queen is keeping her troops on my border to threaten invasion, and she will regret it.<eos> Every rival of England's will want Scotland as an ally, and you will have made two enemies, instead of one.
You thought it was for knick knacks.<eos> And Porzingis is built for the triangle.<eos> Yeah, implementing that motion offense with Carmelo, the biggest ball-stopper in the league on your team, what could go wrong?<eos> Can I help you fellas?<eos> Are you investigating Mike Hayden's murder?
Yeah!<eos> Fight!<eos> Mandala, why are you doing this?<eos> Because it's fun.<eos> Mandala make you young so we can play.
- I've called every one of my exes to come down and vouch for me, and they're freezing me out.<eos> It's like I'm asking them for sex again or something.<eos> I was sure this would clear up on its own, but I always think that because I can't afford penicillin.<eos> The diner's still empty.<eos> Did you two get bored killing your own business and decide to go after mine?
Don't just dismiss it.<eos> I mean... we've got nearly enough members for each month of the year.<eos> Well, perhaps some of you could double up.<eos> Lance, Andy...<eos> Well... Russell, Hugh, you could do one together perhaps.
He did.<eos> Come here.<eos> Get in here.<eos> Get down here.<eos> He's the reason there's a gang war, and you're all playing into his hands.
Come here.<eos> Get in here.<eos> Get down here.<eos> He's the reason there's a gang war, and you're all playing into his hands.<eos> He wants you to kill each other off so he can take over.
You know, I want to turn you in so much, because you are an actual piece of garbage.<eos> But here's the thing:<eos> Your family looks sweet, and I have no problem ruining your life, but their lives...<eos> Oh, my God, Paula, are...<eos> Are you not gonna turn me in to the federales?
- I don't think so.<eos> - Predatory.<eos> - Predatory, yes.<eos> Sharks are highly efficient hunters.<eos> And you, with your metal detectors, are like sharks swimming, not through water, but through dirt, and hunting for metal instead of food?
_<eos> Why didn't you tell us there was no party?<eos> Because we're your parents.<eos> We don't have to tell you things.<eos> You have to tell us things.
You just didn't want to have it with us.<eos> You're embarrassed of us, you and Mitch.<eos> I'm not embarrassed!<eos> We would have been happy to host your friends here.<eos> It's just different when you're around.
Superfly.<eos> Mega Fist.<eos> Blue Swallow.<eos> Detective Babineaux needs your help.<eos> And someday, you may need his.
We really didn't get to the "hearing the plan" part.<eos> Mr. Boss?<eos> Guns?<eos> That's some super-dangerous stuff.<eos> You disappoint me.
About 100 miles away from the closest thing to a city, Juba.<eos> It's the capital of South Sudan.<eos> Which became an independent country in 2011, leaving a whole bunch of ethnic groups to beat each other bloody over territory.<eos> And Burley's in the middle of all of it.<eos> All right, you two, keeps these doctor" families in the loop.
You still in Lenka?<eos> We are, Gibbs.<eos> Did you hear about the SEALs?<eos> Yeah, I'm working on that.<eos> Right now it's time for you to move on.
We also know that you purchased a four-year-old American Paint, purebred horse.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So? Both were paid for in cash, in amounts remarkably similar to withdrawals made from the bank account of Clementine Construction.<eos> Luke Nichols gave you the money, didn't he?<eos> You two were having an affair.
That's the classic description of every serial killer.<eos> How come I slept on the couch last night but you're the grumpy one?<eos> Oh, right, you're married.<eos> Keep it up.<eos> What do you two want?
I assure you, my--<eos> - I'm here to offer my support, Wallace.<eos> We've had our differences, you and I, but we stand by our own.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - That being said, best you lay low for the gala.
Bingo!<eos> Even though you both know I'm gonna say no.<eos> - Enjoy your moment.<eos> - Mission accomplished.<eos> This is the guy we all like, and you both set him up to come in here, and get hurt in front of everybody.
I think I know what she was gonna say.<eos> Sabine, see if you can splice their jamming signal.<eos> We'll need our comm.<eos> On it.<eos> You two better get going.
(BLASTERS COCKING) I think I know what she was gonna say.<eos> Sabine, see if you can splice their jamming signal.<eos> We'll need our comm.<eos> On it.<eos> You two better get going.
We need to call the cops.<eos> Here, put it back, quickly!<eos> Give me that.<eos> Hey.<eos> What're you two doing here?
T-e-n-t-s and t-e-- You're right.<eos> It's a horrible joke.<eos> But it's all your fault.<eos> I told you!<eos> For the record, we are just as grossed out at the thought of you all having sex --
First thing to do is eliminate the agent.<eos> Next, wipe out his history.<eos> It means we need to move fast if we're gonna find any information.<eos> I'll take Lam's furniture store.<eos> You take his residence.
Night hawking.<eos> Found guilty of two counts of disturbing war graves.<eos> Bastard.<eos> Oh, well, we weren't to know.<eos> You knew.
And why are you digging this site?<eos> There's no gold in this plane.<eos> Why would there be?<eos> Whoever convinced you that there was made a fool of ya.<eos> You're the ones that did the digging.
I've been watching a lot of Discovery Channel.<eos> Did you know that...<eos> That there's a dead Marine in an alley?<eos> Yeah, I did.<eos> And now you do, too.
Yeah, the downtown branch.<eos> Has he really been that close all this time?<eos> If he is, we'll find him.<eos> Yes, but so can the killer.<eos> You're just finding out about that postmark.
Wai and Hung got in a fight.<eos> Mr. Wong asked me to tell you and go have a look.<eos> Those 2 little monsters always get in trouble... ok...<eos> let me go outside.<eos> You two get back to your rooms and stay inside.
Christoph.<eos> Here, your mother.<eos> Could offer him a blanket, When he sleeps here.<eos> Listen, we have to go now.<eos> Are you staying here or what?
We should talk someplace more private.<eos> I understand you're lecturing tomorrow at the Sorbonne.<eos> Is the FBI keeping tabs on me?<eos> Actually, we arranged the lecture.<eos> What do you mean, you arranged it?
His elder brother had been eaten by a lion 'and his younger brother would be mauled to death by a buffalo.<eos> That is enough personal tragedy to finish a man, but Grey bore it, somehow.<eos> That dreadful man, Eyre Crowe, I'll wager he sees this as an opportunity -to have a go at the Germans.<eos> -Now, now, dear, Sir Edward has come here to relax, not to talk shop.<eos> Nonsense, he loves talking shop, you all do. Look at David over there.
But nothing that binds you in a crisis?<eos> We are still speculating.<eos> Yes, well, I have nothing to hide.<eos> His Majesty's Government has an obligation to Parliament not to incur... secret liabilities abroad, you know that.<eos> I often think we are a little more open on that score than you are.
But then you guys grew up and left.<eos> Business went bad, and there was just me and her.<eos> I was just so unhappy, Janie.<eos> So you're only back because you need us.<eos> I was hoping that you need me, too.
He downloaded a file containing the identities and histories of every current, past and potential member of the suicide squad.<eos> Including ours?<eos> That's right!<eos> He's threatening to release them all on the Internet.<eos> You're going to get it back.
I know just the place.<eos> All right.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Hey.<eos> I know what this stuff looks like. Do you?
Or else I will sit here quietly until you say it's okay!<eos> I'm here. I'm here.<eos> Tyler!<eos> - Edith?<eos> - You two know each other?
Right, away you go, driver.<eos> Now, you are 16 of the cleverest young brains in this country.<eos> Now, outside you might be considered nerds or geeks or whatever the insult du jour might be.<eos> But here, you are among kindred spirits.<eos> Now, assuming you're capable of basic arithmetic, you'll know that there are six places available yet more than six of you.
They all began their mathematical journeys here.<eos> Trinity alumni have accumulated thirty two Nobel prizes and no less than four Fields Medals.<eos> Although Russell did go off the rails somewhat later in his career.<eos> But nevertheless, this is the most prestigious place to study mathematics on the planet. And you are here.<eos> Because they are the past and you are the future.
What, you deride me was well '?<eos> No!<eos> Remember instead to deliver that famous article to Vieusseux.<eos> What annoyance I<eos> You asked to write it.
Excuse me, ma'am.<eos> Wonder if you might have seen Some of my friends pass through here.<eos> Big guy, kind of funny ears. [ chuckles ] [ body thuds ]<eos> Well, it's been a pleasure having company, But once a century is enough for me.<eos> You can let yourselves out.
Strange it'd be the first thing you'd think of.<eos> Open the overnight bag.<eos> Unzip the compartment.<eos> Lindsay Denton, we're hereby returning you to custody.<eos> Who are you two to judge me?
What's happening?<eos> You forget that I'm here?<eos> You close the door?<eos> I just wanted to ask.<eos> Only you know about us.
- Thank you.<eos> - Well, Happy Birthday.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You got plans, I hope?<eos> Yeah. Do you have a thing for this?
Because it's not the Pentagon.<eos> It's a private contractor.<eos> And there's a lot of them in Texas.<eos> I'll worry about that.<eos> You two just stay focused on patient zero.
We need proof that Carter's involved.<eos> How are you gonna get that?<eos> He's arrogant and probably doesn't think he's done anything wrong.<eos> He'll make a mistake. But that's my concern.<eos> You just stay on problem.
You know, you're not the only one with a voice in your head.<eos> Mine's a sentry that whispers in my ear when my protectee's in danger.<eos> Is it whispering now?<eos> It's screaming at me.<eos> You two want to keep arguing, or are we going in?
The security system is wireless.<eos> They're being held in a sub-basement in the southwest corner.<eos> There's a steam tunnel I can get them through.<eos> Once the doctors make them presentable, a guard contingent will arrive and transfer them upstairs for the dog-and-pony.<eos> You two have to get clear of the building before the guards realize something's wrong.
Oh, nonsense!<eos> It's 3:00 A.M.!<eos> You have your own suite across the hall.<eos> Keys on the table, room service on me.<eos> All right, well, you two enjoy yourselves.
I think you... I-I am truly sorry, Ms. Bradshaw.<eos> But unfortunately, matriculating at N.Y.U.<eos> This fall is not an option.<eos> There are no slots.<eos> But you accepted me.
I think we got a dogfight going on in there.<eos> Anybody got a visual on that noise?<eos> Hey, are they with you guys?<eos> That's not us.<eos> You two stay there.
She got pregnant, and then she died in early labour.<eos> And so did...<eos> Whatever it was.<eos> That's not you!<eos> You're both wolves.
What? I do speak for her.<eos> - Told you,dumb-ass!<eos> - Shut up!<eos> Boys, look at me.<eos> Now, this bar is closing, and you're both very tired.
Bridge, why do you care so much about moving on?<eos> Because I'm dating Danny.<eos> I'm dating Danny.<eos> Bridget, as a friend, I can tell you that that's a really, really bad idea.<eos> - You guys broke up 6 months ago.
Doesn't surprise me at all.<eos> I can't find a single downside to this place.<eos> I'm afraid to ask.<eos> What's the rent?<eos> Uh, well, I would really hate to leave this place vacant, and you two seem like such nice boys, so for you, I would say $800.
Dudes, just 'cause you couldn't see me doesn't mean I couldn't see you.<eos> The drama, the fighting...<eos> It's stupid.<eos> My mom's taking home a ghost.<eos> You two... You're both still here.
It's so not a ghost.<eos> No.<eos> Okay.<eos> We'll bite.<eos> What do you think it is?
[ Clears throat ]<eos> Go to hell.<eos> Oh, if only.<eos> What's going on with you, huh?<eos> You call me, you hang up.
W-what about that guy I saw in the mirror?<eos> With -- with the messed-up face?<eos> It's probably a wraith.<eos> Look, a lot of these things, they can look human until you catch them in a mirror or sometimes a camera.<eos> So -- so you find this -- this whatever, a-and you're -- you're gonna chop its head off?
They were his agents, not yours.<eos> You don't trust me, fine.<eos> I understand.<eos> I've Made mistakes.<eos> But haven't you?
Our friendships here will also be yours.<eos> Do you like to play games with people?<eos> They are only candidates.<eos> No one knows who wins.<eos> But it is true that you have more friends here than we have. It is important to have friends.
You, take.<eos> But what do you know shoot?<eos> - Yes - there Shoot, shoot.<eos> - It's beautiful!<eos> But you are friends dad, right?
I heard there's a reward.<eos> SQ, just me and the kid go into the theater, because it's a kids' school recital, and if we all went in, it'd be chaos.<eos> Okay, but why not let me come too?<eos> I want to kill that rat Ciro too.<eos> No, you wait outside, if he comes out, you shoot him.
He only got two and a half mil.<eos> We're dead either way.<eos> So what do we do?<eos> I'm gonna take a look at Kendra.<eos> I want you to take a look at Cheat's dealer.
There are a lot of biker Red Hawks, and I know where they hang out.<eos> We can talk to the cops about looking there first.<eos> And say what?<eos> Hey, we don't have a name, but anybody here want to confess to beating a man half to death?<eos> Okay, I know that you alien freaks are really enjoying your newfound freedoms, but I'm a little bit busy right now, so, can you go celebrate with someone else?
Uh, yeah, no.<eos> I mean, you people called me.
Upstairs, upstairs, top floor.<eos> Please find her.<eos> Right.<eos> Mince, Rob, get up there with Ziggy, pull both hose-reels off that pump.<eos> Little Al, Asbo, you're searching downstairs.
You've got my nulla-nulla.<eos> I need it.<eos> You boys are in very serious trouble.<eos> You've ruined the excursion for everyone.<eos> I have exhausted students on the bus back there, while you sit here and do what?
- I thought we were a team!<eos> This is not a team!<eos> We're police officers.<eos> We're a team.<eos> You're just...
Very strange boys.<eos> - Good luck, then, Dad.<eos> - Thanks, Son.<eos> I mean, Jake!<eos> You head back to the police station...
Someone I hadn't dealt with before.<eos> He told me to imagine a constellation of stars.<eos> The axis had to shift slightly and stars had to be lined up in a certain way before they could proceed.<eos> What was his name?<eos> They don't trade in real names any more than you do.
It was never meant as anything more than a distraction, something to keep us busy while the real business went on elsewhere.<eos> No.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> This... that makes no sense.<eos> You are saying Moscow wanted you to know about Operation Glass, but how could they?
I mean, you know...<eos> Music, maybe?<eos> Books?<eos> Books?<eos> We have Chekhov, Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, and you have Agatha Christie.
So what now?<eos> We set a trap.<eos> _<eos> On the day, I'll stay in the lobby.<eos> You two watch the street.
Ian.<eos> Hi. How are you?<eos> Why didn't you tell me you were here?<eos> I didn't know this was your hospital.<eos> Wait. You two know one another?
That'll be the fucking day!<eos> When I've finished my maps...<eos> Listen!<eos> ..of the New World, my Pisan friend Cristoforo will make me a rich man.<eos> You two go along without me.
Kensi and Deeks are on the way.<eos> That's not good.<eos> Harbormaster, Coast Guard and Navy have all been alerted to this vessel and its location.<eos> You cannot escape.<eos> Neither can you.
Out there.<eos> Why'd you go?<eos> Why did I go?<eos> Two reasons:<eos> one, there was an F-150 filled with explosives barreling down at us, and two, you said,
Yeah. I mean, we use aliases and don't post any pictures that would compromise us.<eos> "Us"?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm on, too. But unlike Deeks, my page doesn't need to be sanitized.<eos> Wait a minute, so, you Special Agent Ninjas don't dust off your digitals?
"why do girls go for the jerks and the creeps?"<eos> Do you want to know why?<eos> Yeah? Because they're the only ones who have the balls to come over and talk to us.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - Yeah. We're not crazy.<eos> - You make us crazy. - Mm.
Don't you know people need to be told what they want, 'cause it's actually what they need?<eos> Where'd you learn that...<eos> From your wife that has you on that diet?<eos> Damn!<eos> I don't want to be on his wife's diet. Do you?
Why would Nadia be compelling me?<eos> I need a crash course on all things Elena Gilbert, and I figured who knows her better than her compellable best friend?<eos> So tell me, now that you've slept with Klaus, how was it?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> And you are?
What's going on?<eos> Liv is up to something.<eos> She said Elena is important to the travelers.<eos> Liv?<eos> Since when do you two talk?
- Griffin, just listen to me...<eos> I know that's not what you want to hear, dad, but...<eos> None of that matters now...<eos> But you're just going to have trust me, because if you don't...<eos> I know you're clean.
- CNN had to retract.<eos> No arrest has been made.<eos> Once again, our own John King...<eos> Hey! What are you doing?<eos> Worst moment in this guy's life and you're cheering?
- I don't know.<eos> - We're very busy.<eos> Should we be thinking about that?<eos> Yes, you should.<eos> You two were at the children's hospital with Troy?
"A" for effort, gold star...<eos> I'll tell my sister you tried.<eos> Look, think this through.<eos> You don't think I have?<eos> We're telling them, you go up against us, it's gonna be five times more painful for them.
He obviously can't.<eos> - So, what's the dirt?<eos> - Triple homicide.<eos> So what do you want with those files?<eos> Wait. Did you do it?
And what does USA start with?<eos> That's right!<eos> It starts with you!<eos> Today I announce my candidacy for President of the United States of America!<eos> Here I stand, there you are!
What?<eos> Maw Maw, you can't leave us.<eos> We love you.<eos> Oh, drop the lovey-dovey act, Ginny.<eos> You two will be just fine.
We love you.<eos> Oh, drop the lovey-dovey act, Ginny.<eos> You two will be just fine.<eos> That's the beauty of the reverse mortgage.<eos> While Maw Maw gets to travel and do all the things she wants to do, you get to stay in the house for the life of the mortgage.
Don't give me any more details.<eos> I don't want a visual on this.<eos> Hey, look, I don't know what you guys looking so shook for, man.<eos> Sneakers are gonna make us a lot of money.<eos> I just run the numbers, you make the call.
The family needs this, Debs.<eos> Oh, he's good.<eos> He is good. We've had a tough year.<eos> What with Fidelma getting pregnant and Trisha failing her exams and Martin knocking down the wall, and Sinead...<eos> Well, Sinead! I've done a bunch of stuff you don't know about.
Please, we change our minds and we must ask you please to leave.<eos> What are you talking about, leave?<eos> Your wife is here to have the procedure.<eos> My wife thinks now the procedure is contrary to the will of God.<eos> What do you know about the will of God?
How do we do that?<eos> By building cases that put the people they care about behind bars and keeps the people we care about above the ground.<eos> Yeah, but if we put pressure on civilians, there's gonna be blowback on us.<eos> It's my op, I will take the heat.<eos> You just get results.
It must be a family trait.<eos> I've heard all the rumors about Wade.<eos> I grew up two towns over.<eos> But the Wade I was with tonight, he was not that guy.<eos> And I know, you two broke up for a reason.
_<eos> _<eos> Where are Minnie and Wheatie?<eos> Not all of you accepted my generosity.<eos> Only you, men with vision, did.
I bought a burner.<eos> Can you believe that?<eos> Me in some grimy back alley buying a prepaid phone from a kid who probably stole the thing.<eos> Oh, that was smart -- if, in fact, your digital life has been compromised.<eos> You two can do this?
She may be your type, but you don't seem like hers.<eos> Nah, she was happy I asked her-- once I convinced her I wasn't a cop.<eos> Are we gonna go anywhere?<eos> This our car? Yep.<eos> Okay, you two take the side and the rear of the warehouse.
Hey.<eos> How you doing?<eos> All right.<eos> Just got word that the FBI has officially hired you as consultants for the case.<eos> You're the ones who first found out we were being tracked.
Back in Austin.<eos> She's still dealing with Ardiles' murder.<eos> Oh.<eos> Uh, dos champurrados, uh, para mi amigos. Oh, I'm fine. No, thanks.<eos> You're missing out.
Or...<eos> Perhaps I should say...<eos> Rachel.<eos> In 1986, you were implicated in an eco-terrorism bombing just south of the Canadian border.<eos> You call it "terrorism."
Or are you thinking it's something a little more sophisticated?<eos> Given his technological skills, he wouldn't even need to get his hands dirty.<eos> Ivan's had a very long career-- 10 years of collapsing Russian markets, selling off government secrets, disrupting Siberian pipelines.<eos> It sounds like his beef's with Moscow.<eos> This is the first time Ivan's ever struck on US soil, a fact that should have you all very concerned, because whatever he has planned, this is only the very beginning.
That's where Ivan is currently.<eos> Wait, when did you learn this?<eos> I've always known this.<eos> And it didn't occur to you to say something earlier?<eos> You FBI are such blunt instruments.
He's brainwashed you!<eos> Can you please trust me, any of you?<eos> What is going on?<eos> I'll take care of this. Bo, get back!<eos> No you need to get back.
Do they go to the cheetahs in?<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> - Are they dangerous?<eos> I hope you like it.<eos> Hopefully you are not wimps.
Now.<eos> - Yeah, well, we lost her.<eos> - What?<eos> - She's back on the train.<eos> - You two have to arm up... call Hale, call Kenzi, call Tamsin, hell, call Vex.
Well, I can make you something else.<eos> Oh, no, I won't be drinking tonight.<eos> One little nervous breakdown and suddenly you're sober?<eos> Gotta stay sharp, boss lady.<eos> But you, by all means, please, please, please drink.
You'd make a good Trekkie monster...<eos> - Is he the wealthy mayor of Avenue Q?<eos> - No. He's a weirdo who's obsessed with Internet porn.<eos> Can you please leave?<eos> Honestly, you both kinda look like puppets.
Oh, yeah, you want Gold...<eos> Max Gold.<eos> He's on his way.<eos> You Gold?<eos> Yeah. And you're...
She lets you see her naked.<eos> Knuckleheads?<eos> Never thought she was lying.<eos> Me, neither.<eos> Well, I then I have bad news for you-- you're all idiots.
You know, we appreciate your help so much we thought we'd give you a heads-up.<eos> - You're about to be fired. - He's clean.<eos> What?<eos> Why?<eos> - You've been leaking information, Julian.
You've done your part. Now we'll do ours.<eos> If everything goes as planned, Cybertek's security team won't even know we were on the train.<eos> - So we're going in undercover.<eos> - I hate undercover.<eos> May and Ward, you're front and center.
We have no choice.<eos> There's only fighting or laying down.<eos> Courage or cowardice.<eos> I know which I choose.<eos> The question is, do you?
- Tree sap or some shit all over it. - Mm-hm.<eos> How long's the trip to the next squirrel cage?<eos> Three and a half hours.<eos> And no potty stops.<eos> You two won't mind driving back with the windows down then, huh?
I thought I should follow up after that odd experience you must have had.<eos> It's fine.<eos> Stop saying it's fine when it isn't.<eos> I mean, it's like the question thing.<eos> We fought so hard so you wouldn't have to do it, and you girls just keep doing it.
Nothing.<eos> Luke... ?<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> This is my fault.<eos> You had nothing to do with this.
I think I know him a little better than you!<eos> Really?<eos> How much better?<eos> Oh, wait a minute.<eos> Did you... did you two... ?
What should we do?<eos> I'm just gonna sit here.<eos> Hey. Everything all right?<eos> Yeah. We'll talk about this later.<eos> You two want massages as well?
Hey, guys, listen to this.<eos> My name's Cam.<eos> I'm the sheriff of Dodge... Ball.<eos> Okay, you guys are the Hatfields.<eos> You are the McCoys.
What do you think-- you're the only one that's hurting?<eos> Finch send you?<eos> He's worried about you.<eos> She has a new number for us.<eos> So you two know each other?
Packing a pillow with packing peanuts, 'cause that's necessary!<eos> What do you pack packing peanuts with, pillows?<eos> Pillows are nature's packing peanuts!<eos> (man whispering) Abbi.<eos> No, you're the fools!
Wants to keep her safe.<eos> I feel the same way about Dillon, specially when he starts asking questions.<eos> Have you guys been together a long time?<eos> Since 9th grade.<eos> Did you two ever...
You must hate Jafar more than anyone for keeping you locked up like this.<eos> I believe he's as much my captive as I am his.<eos> We create our own prisons.<eos> I suppose we do.<eos> What are you two doing here? !
Sam, can I ask you something?<eos> Sure.<eos> What's up with you and drew?<eos> Uh, what do you mean?<eos> You're angry with each other.
What...? Mm-hmm. Either one of those excuses alone would have been perfectly good.<eos> But together, I smell something fishy.<eos> Oh, yeah. When Jimmy uses a double excuse, it means he's lying about something.<eos> I'm gonna find out what's going on. Good.<eos> You two are married now.
What are you waiting for, Father?<eos> Just kill us and get it over with.<eos> Death is too... forgiving a punishment.<eos> I want to do something far worse.<eos> I really want you all to live a long, long time in misery.
What about Joanna?<eos> Can't she help?<eos> Joanna isn't equipped to deal with this right now.<eos> And I'm not gonna put you in danger, Ingrid.<eos> You two stay here.
Ah.<eos> What is... this...<eos> Fit the cat's bell... for it... to end.<eos> What does it mean?<eos> Well, you two should change to your outfit, too.
Koutarou!<eos> What is this?<eos> Is this, perhaps...<eos> Insert the seven keys with seven people then turn it simultaneously to open the door.~<eos> Hey, how many are you?
- I should be at school.<eos> - No, no, Kyle, you shouldn't do that.<eos> Try to relax, and just take a breath.<eos> What happened to me?<eos> Who are you?
Bunch of studies done in London told me that.<eos> Well, if they're done in London<eos> - they must be true, right?<eos> - Must be.<eos> So you're the cops.
It's got these sliding rear seats that recline, and it's got enormous cargo space.<eos> I think you could probably fit the whole family in here.<eos> Plus, it's a hybrid, right?<eos> So that's great.<eos> I mean, because it's, you know, really environmentally, you know, whatever liberals think it should be. So, what do you think?
No.<eos> No, I wrap my victims up in plastic couch covers, like the one that you're sitting on, and then I bury them in the backyard or dump them somewhere.<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> Our cellphone-tracking equipment is better than yours.<eos> We can tell you where Weller is within three feet, but you can get a warrant faster.
Juliette, why aren't you answering my...<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I didn't know you two were...
They did as we asked.<eos> And Aziz was returned to them.<eos> Some of your parents will be asked to do something for us.<eos> Something to secure your freedom.<eos> If they do as we ask, you will go home, too.
Stop holding Thomas up as a model for what a good son is supposed to be, because, let me tell you something, he had plenty of secrets that he never told you.<eos> Talk about secrets?<eos> Do you know about the affair that he had?<eos> Do you know about the fact that he's got a child who's 22 years old now?<eos> I guess you all know about Natalie.
Mrs Masters, what a pleasure.<eos> No, actually, this is Mrs Masters.<eos> And Mrs Johnson works with Bill, which is like being married.<eos> Yes, only the hours are worse.<eos> There you two are.
Are you gonna have a tree?<eos> Oh, um, I don't know, goosey.<eos> We-- we will have Christmas when you're back.<eos> Who's gonna give you presents?<eos> You will send me letters and postcards from every place you go.
And the only reason he's "with you" is because I allow him to be.<eos> But now that's gonna end.<eos> Whatever this is between the two of you, it's over.<eos> What Dec and I have is called a relationship.<eos> What do you two have?
Thanks.<eos> Alright, first things first.<eos> I'm gonna order a tox screen. You and...<eos> Bruno.<eos> Yeah, you two take Ms. Devoe back to CT for that scan.
Well, life throws challenges at us to see what we're made of, right?<eos> Yeah, apparently, I'm made of bourbon and blow.<eos> Yeah.<eos> A necktie can't hold that in very long.<eos> But you're clean now.
As you know, our goal at Washington Redskins, is to not do anything, and make money not doing it.<eos> When KickStarter went down many saw their start-up projects die, but here at Washington Redskins we saw opportunity.<eos> People still need a way to raise money for their stupid start-up projects. And with the Redskins, you can now, go fund yourself.<eos> And the idea is simple.<eos> You, the people, go out and raise all your own money
[Remy] Dad?<eos> - [gasps] - Time to go.<eos> We've got a date.<eos> You're finished, Dillon.<eos> You're the ones who are finished.
Bravo!<eos> The song should be on the Broadway.<eos> All right, let's stop playing around.<eos> Actually, let's just take a beat and... and just enjoy how amazing those performances were.<eos> But today, right now, you are all winners.
Listen, I don't think you realize how dangerous it is out there, guys.<eos> I mean, we haven't even discussed pickpockets, kidnappers, dognappers, con artists, global warming,<eos> - swine flu...<eos> - Enough.<eos> Weavers, you may choose to live in fear, but we do not.
Give me the knives!<eos> Come on.<eos> Okay.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> You are kid-iots.
I knew he didn't.<eos> I knew he wasn't that type of man.<eos> You have no fucking idea what type of man he was.<eos> Maybe not.<eos> But I know exactly what type of men you are.
- I know they were on an off-book mission.<eos> No dog tags. No ID.<eos> I know you were in the Swat Valley.<eos> The same place those Special Ops soldiers delivered 10 million in cash to a warlord named Massoud.<eos> I know that you robbed them.
Yes, I am.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Can't some grunts do this?<eos> No.<eos> Today, you are the grunts.
What is this?<eos> A last chance to see the truth.<eos> The truth about what?<eos> The people you work for, silly.<eos> I will go where you can't go.
Well, looking at the history of Star Chamber, they love riddles.<eos> So this message, "They died in vein,"<eos> spelled V-E-I-N, that's not just a homonym mistake, it a clue.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's their game-- "we know something you don't."
UQ/V, Stupid, moody, unpleasant...<eos> That's why... I hate myself.<eos> That's why everyone...<eos> We don't have long to live.<eos> Typically, you're the ones who...
I guess we're the nerds I do not know.<eos> I Based on what?<eos> Based on they seem really fit.<eos> That leaves the middle group.<eos> You must be Force.
That is clear.<eos> Jeff But I want to add that is why I wanted to talk privately.<eos> She gets angry easily.<eos> And I knew he would do something like that when hear that.<eos> But you are responsible for telling that he was leaving.
Months, okay?<eos> It's been months.<eos> Rosemary, my cross is caught.<eos> Oh. You want to hold here?<eos> There's too much pressure for you both to have a baby.
It's okay to trust people.<eos> Some people.<eos> Other people, who knows?<eos> You turn your back for one second, and they have a whole other family on the bad side of town.<eos> You are my other family from the bad side of town.
I got the sweet rolls you like.<eos> - I stopped off at the bakery.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - You know how I love this nino? - Uh huh.<eos> Everyday he call me or came while you were away.
- part, is this was, like, 1890. - Will you hurry up?<eos> We're losing him.<eos> Ron, shut up!<eos> Okay, Carol, you know the tunnels, you lead the group.<eos> Cyril and Pam, you carry Ron.
All right, let's keep it low profile.<eos> Four guys inside the hotel.<eos> No guns unless we have to.<eos> You're with us.<eos> You two seal off the exits.
You can now trade pork bellies.<eos> Let's do this quickly.<eos> The trading floor is on the mezzanine.<eos> We can't let him get up there.<eos> You two take the back exit.
Okay, okay, so why the rush?<eos> Because he asked, and I answered.<eos> And it feels right to me.<eos> I'm trusting my gut.<eos> I would think you of all people could understand that.
- Norwood had everyone fooled.<eos> - Not me.<eos> I always knew<eos> - there was something up with that guy.<eos> - You knew?
- You know what?<eos> - The bat mentalist, he doesn't gloat.<eos> - Mike, what about us?<eos> Are you mad?<eos> No, you're both... sort of adults.
-So? So?<eos> Maths is so!<eos> I've got 18 bridges stretched across 20 miles of canal.<eos> And you have been ordered to demolish exactly none of them.<eos> You engineering boys are all the same, not happy unless you're blowing the shit out of something.
Think it was Andre Sagassi over there.<eos> Me?<eos> Well... maybe this game isn't so bad after all.<eos> She's tasted first blood, boys.<eos> You two better watch out.
But the cash from your system packages is running out, correct?<eos> Guys, I'm gonna find out anyway.<eos> - How's that?<eos> - Well, we partner with you, we audit your books top to bottom, install upper management on-site, probably Roger.<eos> - You'd report to him.
You shouldn't say that.<eos> We've been robbing the rich for the poor. What's wrong with fighting for justice?<eos> So you say you are self sufficient, tough guys.<eos> Then go jump off the IFC<eos> You two and uncle should visit mom more often
You're not gonna be the godfather, Will.<eos> But if you wanna be Fredo, I'll gladly put you in a rowboat and shoot you.<eos> I'm not here to be the godfather, Laurie.<eos> I am here to be a friend.<eos> I would like to babysit the little people while you two go out and spend some alone time for a few hours.
All right.<eos> I'm just gonna chalk that up to you two being upset, what with half your crew dead in Mexico. Oh, yeah. Y-you didn't know that?<eos> Yeah. Federales found them all shot up in their truck with traces of heroin.<eos> Long gone.<eos> Oh, I bet... I bet you two boys were expecting that heroin to come your way, weren't you?
- Kill her.<eos> Kill her!<eos> Kill her!<eos> Kill her!<eos> You did this to me that night.
We do not need a new car, Philip.<eos> It's cheaper than a plane.<eos> That's all I'm...<eos> I'm glad you're okay.<eos> When I heard about Emmett and Leanne, I was afraid you might...
Nothing much.<eos> We're, uh... we're having a long, lazy, romantic morning.<eos> I know.<eos> You know, once in a while you and daddy should just...<eos> No, really, you should.
Martial Eagle could present a threat to the Motherland.<eos> Once we know how and why, we want to eliminate him.<eos> ...the unanimous backing of Congress and the support of the American people...<eos> I will relay your point of view to the Centre.<eos> They won't want you and your family unnecessarily exposed.
We did it.<eos> All the pics deleted.<eos> That was awesome!<eos> I mean, terrifying. Completely terrifying... But kind of awesome.<eos> I've never done anything like that before. Have you?
Should be fine in a couple of hours.<eos> Unless whoever shot you manages to find you again.<eos> Lydia's with Scott.<eos> We need to go.<eos> Are you gonna try to convince her to go with you?
OK, listen up.<eos> This is the north end of Kenville Park where Robbie Hyland has identified where he and Toby kept their den.<eos> Torches on.<eos> Charlie, I want you to take two guys, let's check access areas around here.<eos> Roger, Mark, you come with me.
More importantly, why aren't yours?<eos> The twins told me it prevents saddle chafing.<eos> Oh, they did, did they?<eos> They also let the sheep in, and sheep love broadgrass.<eos> And I'm guessing you're also the ones who dropped the bird of death.
Bye.<eos> He's just so cute.<eos> Right, are you all ready to cook the best dishes of your entire lives?<eos> Yes, chef!<eos> You will all have to make one stunning MasterChef restaurant-quality dish using the ingredients in front of you.
Let's go, guys.<eos> It's not funny, Natalie.<eos> Come on down, please.<eos> There we go.<eos> Tonight, you'll all have to cook us one amazing chicken dish.
If I call your name, please step forward.<eos> Sean.<eos> Oona.<eos> Samuel.<eos> You three home cooks, age 12, 12, and 9, gave us the best dishes of the night.
I did have the better of the two plays, but because you have veto power, we're gonna toss mine?<eos> Cool, that sounds great.<eos> I'm on board.<eos> Thank you for the support.<eos> Jeannie Beannie, William, Doug, you're coming with me.
Vespuccia! Urgh! Argh!<eos> A word, please, Officer.<eos> Shut it, shit-slinger, I'm trying to take a head count.<eos> All the while we've been here, we've not been given a chance to state our case.<eos> What case? Aren't you the two they found burying bodies with that chest of gold?
Why me?<eos> Your face is one I've seen before.<eos> Christ, I needed that!<eos> These markings tell the story of my people.<eos> We have no need to travel the seas as you do.
Hers?<eos> It fits into a collar that was found on a beast skeleton.<eos> So, unless there's something about her DNA that I don't know about...<eos> I feel like I'm in the middle of a divorce.<eos> And you two are fighting over the beach house.
What makes you think you could buy my roommate?<eos> She said, "I'll give you the key if you buy me new shoes."<eos> Ha! For love!<eos> I did it for love!<eos> You two belong together.
What did you think of Chef Holden's sous-vide duck?<eos> Oh, that technique was controversial.<eos> You know, I-I've made the grilled watermelon with the charred beef and fennel.<eos> You're making me hungry.<eos> Can you two foodies stop salivating, please?
Don't judge till you try it.<eos> - Mmm. - Okay, gang...<eos> - I'm fine.<eos> - My Dad wants this field cleared and ready for planting by the end of the week.<eos> Astrid, Snotlout, you two break down and clear out the big boulders
No, I mean make it a fair fight - ocean floor, but the bear gets scuba gear.<eos> - Interesting.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Hey, how did your date with Kelly go?<eos> Did you finally...
They really need to replace that thing.<eos> I-is that how you solve all your problems?<eos> Uh, what if that old printer has only been here for two months and already increased ad sales by 15%?<eos> And what if that printer doesn't have any savings because it spent it all on vintage toys?<eos> Did you two ever think about that?
No, we cannot, because the best breasts are behind us.<eos> Shame on you all.<eos> This man had a nice evening planned.<eos> Yeah!<eos> And where were you?
- No, my lord.<eos> - Oh, we're in time, then.<eos> Agnes, we're here to take the baby away, and it might be a good idea for you and your nephew to leave, as well.<eos> Just for a while.<eos> If you don't, then... you... you might be questioned.
- What did you get?<eos> - I can give you the phone number<eos> - and exact address where the call went to.<eos> - Go.<eos> You two take point on this.
- Don'tmove!<eos> - You got no right.<eos> - That's not yours, man.<eos> - It is now.<eos> "You've all been brothers to me, family, and since my son's been taken, you're the only ones who've been there for me.
# Do, re, mi, fa, so, la, ti... #<eos> I'm just phoning...<eos> If, erm...<eos> If you think there's any chance of us getting back together... just give me a sign.<eos> Oh, what are you two doing here?
Enchant√©, Ginger.<eos> Welcome to our shithole.<eos> What are you talking about, shithole?<eos> This place is charming.<eos> Um, are you two...
And what about Daniel?<eos> What about keeping him safe?<eos> My son's safe.<eos> You know, that was you and your Captain Chapel.<eos> And you're the ones that set him up, the GTF.
Look at us.<eos> We're beautiful.<eos> Every woman in this place would kill for Virginia's breasts or her thighs or her wings.<eos> Oh, my God, I'm hungry!<eos> Oh, you're going through junk food withdrawal.
We just...<eos> These are our children we are talking about!<eos> Are you going to order a quarantine?<eos> No, we are not planning on shutting down the school at this point.<eos> We want the answers just as much as you do.
Is this it?<eos> Is that it?<eos> Guys, that's- there's probably more.<eos> I-I can't--I can't believe that you're all here.<eos> I can't believe that you all-- that each of you thought to come over here.
Let's go get Henry.<eos> For luck.<eos> What?<eos> We're at the edge of the Dark Forest trying to find the one person who can stop our imminent doom and save your unborn child.<eos> And you two stop to smell the roses?
We're at the edge of the Dark Forest trying to find the one person who can stop our imminent doom and save your unborn child.<eos> And you two stop to smell the roses?<eos> Snowbells.<eos> I don't care If they're dancing daffodils.<eos> I need to destroy my sister, and so do you.
And she drove me here!<eos> Okay.<eos> This group has an incredibly important job.<eos> You need to figure out how to hold this town together.<eos> You are going to meet twice a week and you're here because of your energy, and your youth, and for some of you, your mental age, and you're going to find a way to make this merger stick.
Sure, they're bad, but not as bad as the football team.<eos> What do you want?<eos> As I said earlier, the cop, Eddy Caplan, did not kill your wife.<eos> He was doing his job.<eos> And if you two had done yours,
Just figure out what you want us to do and we'll do it, Jesus.<eos> Get all the coders in my office.<eos> Now.<eos> I don't know what anyone else has told you, but I'm your manager.<eos> You take instructions from me, okay?
De Tocqueville.<eos> I believe I know who we're dealing with.<eos> Vigilance.<eos> We'll take her.<eos> You four get the target.
And if you join us, you will not only have your revenge, but you will help write a new chapter in American history.<eos> You're right about all of it.<eos> I did work for the government, and I do want revenge.<eos> But if that work taught me anything, it's that how you do matters as much as what you do.<eos> And by that metric, you're all just terrorists.
I'm-- I'm sure you are.<eos> Robert, Emma! Please come in!<eos> Hello, Micah.<eos> Hello, Micah.<eos> I'm so pleased that you two are gonna be my first messengers.
Are you wearing fishnets?<eos> Yes, I am! 'Cause tonight's a big night for me and Tom, a big, big, big night, which is why Tom was relaxing until you two ding-dongs undid all my doing.<eos> And, hello, now Tom's so stressed about who he's supposed to help, he can't... perform.<eos> Well, guess what.<eos> If he can't perform, you don't perform.
A vampire and a werewolf.<eos> The carnage jackpot.<eos> And the longer they stay, the more bodies keep piling up.<eos> I mean, this week alone has been like an all-you-can-eat buffet.<eos> So now you see why I couldn't just let you leave, why I had to fight for you.
All right, pledges, drunk and loud.<eos> When I say "chug," you say "beer!"
- Yes!<eos> Pledges!<eos> When I say, "after-party," you guys say, "15... 20 Hallman Street."<eos> Yeah, yeah, and then I'm gonna just add on to that when I say, "should we bring our swimsuits?"<eos> You say, "well, yeah, weather permitting."
- But do, because it's nice out.<eos> - Right, right.<eos> I'm... I'm...<eos> Guys, when I say, "what should we bring?"<eos> You say, "beer and booze."
Oh, yeah.<eos> Jerk.<eos> Bitch.<eos> Get a room, you two.<eos> Had a room till you two soiled it.
But to where and to when?<eos> Yeah, it doesn't matter.<eos> We've got to stop him.<eos> Right, we'll meet at the portal.<eos> Pete, you three stop and pick up the arrow that killed Achilles.
- Nice.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Funnel your intel here so we can set up the searches.<eos> In the meantime, I've got a briefing with local police and disaster crews.<eos> If they find the lab, I want you two overseeing the search.
From Los Angeles, California.<eos> Y-you won.<eos> Tomorrow, these two hundred lucky women will be invited to Washington, D.C., to begin the next stage of the process.<eos> In three nights, we will welcome them all in an opening ceremony, and you will meet them personally.<eos> You, the people, will vote for the one hundred best mothers.
The lottery is an expression of those fundamental ideals and aspirations.<eos> So, despite early setbacks, we intend to move forward.<eos> There will be a lottery, and we will show the world what we're about.<eos> In fact, we want to invest the nation in this event.<eos> We want you, the people of this great country, to vote for the winners, to pick the next generation of mothers, to have a voice in saving humanity.
Simple as that.<eos> So let's get to it.<eos> 'You are reading your book in my chair.'<eos> Going to slam the door open.<eos> I'll drive for now, you walk alongside.
- Shut up and let me save your life.<eos> You should really put your weapon on the ground.<eos> Why the hell would I do that?<eos> For starters, you just lost possession of your client.<eos> You mercs are all the same.
She found something.<eos> Hello, Special Agent Gibbs.<eos> Hello, Brody.<eos> Been a while.<eos> You two know each other?
This lasagna was supposed to remind our friends of the time we spent together in Bayonne...<eos> When we got get together and, you know, ate lasagna.<eos> This isn't about lasagna, is it?<eos> No, it's not.<eos> It's about the party, which you have ruined.
Oh, my God.<eos> It works.<eos> Every time.<eos> And this is going to tell you...?<eos> If there's a genetic reason why you all keep getting cancer.
Dun-can!<eos> Dun-can!<eos> Dun-can!<eos> Ok, ok.<eos> You win.
Well, then, I'm glad you won't be needing my services.<eos> Actually, can we talk for a moment?<eos> Thought you might want some of the good stuff before we head off to lunch.<eos> Jack, hi.<eos> You two know each other?
Rather than freak you out and get myself fired.<eos> You were fired?<eos> Little on the snug side.<eos> It's fine.<eos> She looks a lot better in a suit than all you do.
Tell you what.<eos> Let's get a second opinion and use my phone.<eos> Good idea.<eos> Stronger flash, yeah.<eos> You must be the lawyers.
- Sure.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...<eos> All right, guys, I need a plan here.<eos> I am "Dan With A Plan" Egan, so if I can't work, then you can't work, and...
We just wanted to say we are such big fans.<eos> It's an honor to meet you.<eos> Yeah, well, I'm very blessed.<eos> It's always nice to meet my amazing fans that keep me going.<eos> You're the real superstars.
The ISEA would never do something like that.<eos> I wouldn't do it to you, as a friend.<eos> Hell, I brought you into this program.<eos> You're family.<eos> Well, if you didn't do it, then who did it?
Oh, he should be out any minute.<eos> Love that you two are still working together.<eos> So many couples that break up over the home life-work life thing.<eos> I've seen this a million times.<eos> But you guys, you've weathered the storm.
Geillis Duncan.<eos> I'm sorry, I should have introduced myself.<eos> My name is...<eos> I know who you are, Claire.<eos> The village has been humming with talk of ye since you came to the castle.
Well, Virginia's not here yet.<eos> But she will be here soon, and I promise we'll be ready to rock.<eos> This means a lot to both of us.<eos> Oh, well, great.<eos> Well, let me know when she arrives, because we're rehearsing in order, and you're on right after Dancin' Dan jumps the shark.
And it worked out in a clever and unexpected way because we did it the way they do on TV.<eos> We didn't replace Hope's fish with a look-alike, and everything worked out great for us, too.<eos> Yeah. And it turns out Hope does have compassion.<eos> She's just not a pet person.<eos> You two did everything the way they do it on TV.
So there is no way that he was rammed into this wall last month.<eos> Let's just review.<eos> The guy's teeth match all four murders.<eos> He's got no alibi, he's got a history of violent sexual assault, he's off his meds, he lied to you, and he went on the run.<eos> You two find someone else that checks all those boxes, come find me.
Nice rock throwing', Pop!<eos> Nice...<eos> video game... stuff, son!<eos> You know, I was wrong.<eos> I thought you boys weren't prepared for the future.
video game... stuff, son!<eos> You know, I was wrong.<eos> I thought you boys weren't prepared for the future.<eos> But now I realize your future is gonna be filled with that crap, so... keep it up.<eos> You guys'll be just fine.
And I know who's responsible.<eos> You do?<eos> Those two degenerates over there.<eos> I'm going to my office and I'm going to call their parents.<eos> You two supervise while I'm gone.
So... it would mean so much if you could help.<eos> We'd be honored.<eos> And of course we'll, uh, keep you in the loop<eos> - on all the preparations.<eos> - Well... nobody knew my son better than you all did, so whatever you decide, I know it will be perfect.
Yeah, that's the truth.<eos> Anyway, I'm just here to make sure she's dead.<eos> And to, uh, see my godson here and meet his lovely bride. Aw.<eos> Wow.<eos> You two are just so cute, I could just eat you up.
First, "congratulations, Lanie."<eos> Oh!<eos> Thank you!<eos> Second, I don't know if he's picked anyone yet.<eos> You... really think it's one of you?
- Do you like...'Cause I am on the V.I.P...<eos> Guys.<eos> I asked Alexis to be my best man.<eos> Aside from Beckett, she's the most important person in my life, so I...<eos> You will be my groomsmen, though, right?
Oh, so you two are a couple?<eos> Well, we're trying to be.<eos> You know what?<eos> That's fine with me.<eos> Because you two lying, backstabbing, no-lunch-eating, fire-escape-kissing cheaters deserve each other!
Pass me the full-sodium rice cakes.<eos> Baby, you're getting so crazy right now.<eos> Full-so rice cakes coming right up.<eos> Come on. Who has more fun than us, right?<eos> When I say "we're more," you say "fun."
'Cause today of all days seems like a pretty good day to rain on our parade.<eos> Because we're literally about to start a parade.<eos> - That's great.<eos> - Lead the way!<eos> As much as we try to fight it, you two are kind of the music in our lives. Oh. And you are the beige in ours.
I mean, I mean, my wife and I, we found your sex tape.<eos> Don't you remember?<eos> You hid it in an old clown doll which we ended up finding.<eos> My wife and I watched that tape over and over again.<eos> Not for the sex, but because seeing how you two related to each other really helped out our marriage.
Okay.<eos> Now what are we gonna do?<eos> No, I guess maybe-- no, th-<eos> - Cam, there's no way I could fit through there.<eos> You two exhaust me.
- No intrusion.<eos> Sergeant Lannon has just been assigned to our detail.<eos> I apologize for my father.<eos> He's a narcissist of the highest order.<eos> What did you both talk about?
Here are two sealed envelopes.<eos> In the blue envelope is a secret that Joe shared with Nate about Mel.<eos> In the pink envelope is a secret that Mel shared with Gillian about Joe.<eos> We kept the secrets.<eos> The question is, will you?"
I have to study.<eos> Doesn't that mean you'll be here?<eos> Study out in public.<eos> I focus best when I'm surrounded by distractions.<eos> You guys wouldn't understand because, well, you're old.
I just spent the last two hours on a date in Lou Fferrigno's Hibachi Heaven.<eos> My clothes smell like soy sauce and the waiter's body spray.<eos> I no longer remember dignity.<eos> Okay, back to us.<eos> You two got us all freaked out.
Yay!<eos> Wait.<eos> Why are you guys cheering?<eos> 'Cause we're coming, too..<eos> No, you're not gonna go with...
I just don't want to crush her spirit.<eos> I can't do it.<eos> I won't.<eos> You know where to hide things, I'll give you that.<eos> You people destroyed my life.
Everyone knows.<eos> Yeah.<eos> This is like we're back in fifth grade.<eos> What's wrong with being in fifth grade?<eos> I wish you all were back in the fifth grade when you had no idea what was going on.
Fertilizer?<eos> Looks like the drugs have been loaded out.<eos> This whole thing's a giant torpedo.<eos> You cannot escape.<eos> Neither can you.
What the hell's jahiliyyah?<eos> The time of darkness before we were given the Quran.<eos> Where we headed, Jabril?<eos> We are going to paradise.<eos> You are going to hell.
That's our new subtenant.<eos> She's a cello teacher.<eos> She's very hot.<eos> I mean, if you're into women who straddle massive instruments. [Chuckles]<eos> You two drive a clown car of immaturity.
Go ahead.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> Uh, you two.<eos> You, you, great.<eos> - You'll make beautiful kids together.
So, I went into the kitchen.<eos> And there, in front of me, dripping with blood...<eos> A KITTEN!<eos> So, yeah, I'm afraid of rats.<eos> But you're afraid of kittens.
Oh. Look at the screen.<eos> Thank you so much, Rayna and Luke.<eos> Thank you for including me today.<eos> And on behalf of myself and my husband, I want to extend our deepest gratitude to all the servicemen and -women watching at Fort Campbell and around the world and to your families, who share in your sacrifice.<eos> You all are serving our country so bravely, and my husband and I strongly believe that when your active duty ends...
Need help figuring it out?<eos> These backwoods roads can be pretty confusing.<eos> Everything's ready.<eos> We'll be set up a 1/4 mile due north of town, ready to go in four hours.<eos> You bring him to us.
It's okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Don't look at me like that!<eos> I didn't start it.<eos> You force me to do all these things.
Actually, Cat has Tess in on this, she'll barely be seen with me.<eos> But don't worry, the, uh, strip search investigation she's following up on is totally legit.<eos> Tess is not IA, okay?<eos> This is completely illegal. You...<eos> You're taking so many risks.
And I'm warning you, Burt, this ass is not gonna bounce back after baby number two at my age.<eos> Welcome to the Natesville Animal Shelter.<eos> (sighs) How can I help you?<eos> We'd like to rescue a dog.<eos> Aw... well, you don't rescue them as much as they rescue you.
Oh my God, we must have died in the taxi and this is heaven.<eos> I knew God was a dude.<eos> Hey, I'm Heidi, I was getting worried you wouldn't show.<eos> Not exactly the sexiest costumes...<eos> But I guess you'll do.
Did someone say girl talk?<eos> I could get me some of that.<eos> Jackie, are you shooting a soap opera?<eos> Oh, of course!<eos> You two haven't met.
You need to shush.<eos> Shush, both of you.<eos> Hmm? Honestly, ganging up on me.<eos> Think you're so smart?<eos> Well, why don't you try to fix it?
- He's... part time.<eos> New strategy ... you shut your mouth and give us everything we want.<eos> You threaten a United States general, and there are consequences.<eos> Oh, you feel powerful now, don't you?<eos> But you're all just slaves who will serve our future.
Time to go.<eos> Ahh!<eos> Mistress Claire!<eos> Serves you right.<eos> What'd you expect the poor animal to do with you barbarians chasing it?
It was guaranteed death.<eos> Now I am considered one of the last of the old-timers, Oskar.<eos> And I am coming for you.<eos> That's the truck that rammed us.<eos> Forensics already dusted for prints, I want you two to go through it top to bottom.
We were thinking this Saturday night might be a little different.<eos> Because tonight we're all yours.<eos> Oh my God!<eos> That is so sweet, oh!<eos> But if you're staying in, I'm going out.
- If you don't mind, I have to get my son off to school.<eos> - You think he's in there?<eos> - With his wife's boyfriend In the house? Eh, not a chance.<eos> - Can only be Thursday, can it?<eos> - You jammed up to?
It stands for "Victory Permafucked."<eos> I don't deserve this.<eos> You know?<eos> God damn it.<eos> I don't, but you do, because you are all losers!
You're sure you saw four ships out there?<eos> Yeah. Why?<eos> Terminal manifest only lists three.<eos> What do you say we take a look behind door number four?<eos> You two head below deck, try to find Grace.
We should move quickly.<eos> Noble attempt at self-sacrifice, Harold, but experience has taught me never to negotiate with terrorists.<eos> My private forces will see you safely back to Washington.<eos> Let's go.<eos> You two, I'm afraid, will be here for the brief remainder of your lives.
What do you mean?<eos> Cotton, we have to kill her. No.<eos> You tell me what you mean!<eos> You think you can dangle me like a puppet?<eos> You're the puppets, all of you... puppets!
And by "my hand,"<eos> you mean "our hands," right?<eos> Okay.<eos> I've been scanning through the restaurant's security footage for two hours; no sign of Evan.<eos> Yeah, you two took your sweet time.
She's my kid, too.<eos> Okay.<eos> What do we got?<eos> We got a domestic.<eos> Maybe you can get Mr. Collins' side of the story, and we'll talk to her.
If this gets fucked, we're all screwed.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> That's why I'm here talking to you.<eos> Why else?<eos> You'll all have a hard time.
RACHEL: "Hello, gorgeous.<eos> "Fanny Brice was my most cherished role.<eos> "But I can't stay in style forever.<eos> Now it's your turn. Barbara."<eos> You of all people should know that Barbra dropped the "A" when she was 18 years old as an act of rebellion.
Oh, my God.<eos> You are the guy... the guy that walked out of my show last night.<eos> What are you doing in my apartment?<eos> In my robe?<eos> Well, aren't you all so very, very rude.
You know I'm talking to you.<eos> I don't need to say your name three times To congratulate myself on remembering it, Like, to create some sort of--<eos> Whatever it is.<eos> False intimacy, or...<eos> So how'd you two meet?
Yes!<eos> Yes, red for the win! Woo! Harper, don't.<eos> This is stupid.<eos> Hey... look what I found.<eos> I'm sure you two want to spend some time alone anyway.
Wait!<eos> How shall we feed ourselves and our children?<eos> Feed yourselves off the land like your fathers did.<eos> You've turned it into clay pits!<eos> We have nothing and you have all!
Certainly not.<eos> I'm Portuguese.<eos> So you're a Catholic.<eos> Like our Queen.<eos> You papist vermin started this fire.
He lets me live next to the place<eos> As long as I work three shifts a week. I clocked in. I clocked out.<eos> Go check.<eos> And he'll probably freak out on me<eos> For bringing the cops around, Maybe even kick me out, But what do you care?
A reputation for not being scared of anything.<eos> In all the world, violent men are the easiest to deal with.<eos> So tell me, which brand of rebel are you, eh?<eos> I read somewhere that you Paddies started fighting amongst yourselves, now.<eos> The King offers you a peace treaty and you start a war about it.
Peace of mind.<eos> It comes from knowing your people are watching out for you.<eos> Like your family doctor, your therapist, your personal trainer, your nutritionist, your physiotherapist, your chiropractor, your entire health and well-being team.<eos> But who can afford specialized care?<eos> You can.
I know.<eos> I need Emily.<eos> Just Emily.<eos> Hey.<eos> He told me you two were... You were done.
Surprise!<eos> See?<eos> Great idea.<eos> You okay?<eos> So, after traveling for 26 straight hours, you think people hiding in the dark and screaming at me in my own home was a good idea.
What?<eos> Oh, and some good news... Pindar's girlfriend arrives tomorrow.<eos> - You're kidding.<eos> - Mm.<eos> So you'll all see that Pindar's telling the truth.
Uh, we haven't started the panel yet...<eos> I have a question for Nora Durst.<eos> We will open the floor to questions...<eos> I am not Nora Durst.<eos> I have been watching you people for the last two days, listening to you, and you are all blind.
- Why not?<eos> It's poison.<eos> Okay.<eos> So, um... tell you what.<eos> Why don't we sit down, and I'll tell you what I got, you tell me what you got, and we act like law enforcement professionals?
She has a neat butt.<eos> - Keep going. - Oh.<eos> Hey!<eos> Call my Beethoven 'cause... I love classical music.<eos> Don't you?
What's there to "talk" about?<eos> We all know why we're here.<eos> Gabe, what's happened to you?<eos> What has happened to me?<eos> You're the ones who are trying to protect a beast!
Yeah, why?<eos> If you have kids, I don't understand how you could stand over his body smoking and then just keep walking your dog.<eos> I knew someone would find him.<eos> Didn't want to get involved.<eos> You people destroyed my family.
We don't have that kind of money.<eos> But if she lost a bet...<eos> I don't know. What's the bet?<eos> Pack your bags, kids.<eos> You're running away, too!
Normally cartels don't employ women in the upper levels.<eos> It sounds like they've made an exception.<eos> So, what makes this woman so special?<eos> I'm not at liberty to say.<eos> We share, you share.
Make sure I get copies of those.<eos> Isn't he funny?<eos> We're with him, so we're just gonna...<eos> Come on.<eos> Through you go.
‚ô™ Gonna be a cop, straight walking a beat ‚ô™<eos> ‚ô™ Role model, out on the street ‚ô™<eos> ‚ô™ Unless I get assigned to a desk, which is also vital ‚ô™<eos> ‚ô™ Because when paperwork slides, that's how you get a mistrial ‚ô™<eos> When I say "miss," you say "trial."
‚ô™ Because when paperwork slides, that's how you get a mistrial ‚ô™<eos> When I say "miss," you say "trial."<eos> - Miss.<eos> - Trial.<eos> I said, when I say "miss," you say "trial."
- Trial.<eos> I said, when I say "miss," you say "trial."<eos> Miss, unless you trying to die.<eos> What, are you nuts?<eos> Then know who you are.
- I think she can really hear you.<eos> - It says "baking news" now.<eos> - Fuck! - 15 seconds.<eos> - Good talking to you, Molly.<eos> You and your men continue your government raid of an American newsroom.
- Nothing, I'm here.<eos> - Is that accent real?<eos> Can we please cut the shit?<eos> I'm gonna infuse ACN with tens of millions of new dollars in your budget. How does that sound?<eos> I'm gonna get 18 to 25-year-olds to watch the news so it can support itself and so it doesn't die when you do.
It's what you want to do.<eos> - She knows.<eos> - What are you still doing here?<eos> I'm brokering this thing because we're all a little tired of you two missing such easy shots.<eos> Things aren't as complicated as you make them.
I am here to listen, but not to the fucking infantry.<eos> Enough!<eos> Jesus!<eos> Now... Some weeks ago, Mr Shelby carried out a military mission on behalf of pro-treaty Republicans here in Birmingham.<eos> You... Working for the King.
They will be looking for someone.<eos> - So you will be free to operate at will. -Looking for who?<eos> Me.<eos> They will be looking for me.<eos> Now, while the coppers are busy with me, you will make your move on Sabini's pitches.
Mm, wants to see what you can do.<eos> Part of getting you out of here as soon as possible.<eos> There a problem?<eos> No.<eos> You say "jump" I jump.
Strangled.<eos> Aw, sweet.<eos> You don't get it.<eos> What? They don't get it.<eos> High-end condos means rich people with money, which they will give to your businesses, so you can become rich.
Except me...<eos> I wanted to advise Drama.<eos> But no, Ms. LaBonz got Drama and I got sis-boom-blah!<eos> Stop yelling.<eos> Anyway, what I am going to do is inject drama into cheerleading, with you as my stars!
Stop.<eos> You can't do this.<eos> Ye, I'm way ahead of you, Dad, and thank you for stopping by.<eos> What I mean is, you can't get married like this.<eos> You two deserve the kind of wedding you've been talking about nonstop for the last nine months.
You're twenty minutes late.<eos> We've decided it's a bad idea.<eos> You never know what could summon Mr. Mordrake.<eos> Even a rehearsal is risky business.<eos> You carnies are so superstitious.
They're not concerned about Mordrake.<eos> I'm trying to tell...<eos> Of course they're not.<eos> Simply a superstition.<eos> You two run along, now.
Well, tell them to stop.<eos> I take that ungrateful hydra dress shopping, and the second I turn my back to buy a slip, they sneak out the back.<eos> Truth is, the stage isn't for everybody, you know.<eos> And tell our monsters that the only thing they should be thinking about is how grateful they are to me for saying yes to this television show.<eos> In a couple of months, I will have you all, every one of you, brought out to join me.
Where you two been?<eos> We got up before sunrise and went hunting fireflies.<eos> Suzi made hotcakes.<eos> Hotcakes! Mm-hmm.<eos> You two coming?
How's that good news?<eos> You've got me.<eos> There's nothing here about the Heathbrooke.<eos> But from these seemingly useless documents, a pattern about other deals Silmas has done before.<eos> Now, you wanted the haunted house?
Uh, did I need one?<eos> That's me.<eos> They're all doing me.<eos> Okay.<eos> You call her Aunt Patsy, but it's Aunt Sassy and you know it, because you cast me in it.
Yeah?<eos> Well, I should, uh...<eos> I'm gonna go say good morning to Nadia.<eos> Me, too.<eos> This'll only be weird if you make it weird.
Or plays baseball.<eos> "Our team is red hot.<eos> Your team is all shot.<eos> We're hot, hot, hot.<eos> You're not, not, not."
Jane, it's small.<eos> - It's a studio.<eos> - Well...<eos> Go.<eos> I trust you lucky people all have quiet homes to go home to.
We've got a play date at the park with a hot single mom.<eos> Well, put a bonnet on a puppy.<eos> Because there is no way that Emma is leaving this apartment until Ben sees her walk.<eos> But this baby is a babe magnet.<eos> And it's not like you all haven't done the exact same thing.
Aviram, you'll be Mattathias who cried out:<eos> "Under the flag of God!"<eos> Yael, you're his wife, mother of all the Maccabees.<eos> Caress your son Yoav's head.<eos> Ron, Sean, Loraine, Doron, Nadav, you're Judah's brothers.
"Under the flag of God!"<eos> Yael, you're his wife, mother of all the Maccabees.<eos> Caress your son Yoav's head.<eos> Ron, Sean, Loraine, Doron, Nadav, you're Judah's brothers.<eos> Gili, Efrat and Melissa, you are the people of Israel.
"Tearing the city apart.<eos> "Tearing<eos> "the city... apart!"<eos> One of our friends, a writer, said today:<eos> "lf no one's buying poetry books "and if the government doesn't care, they hate culture, "then you, poets, have no choice.
Called Little John.<eos> He's my loyal companion in many an adventure.<eos> Oh! Works every time!<eos> Oh, I cannot believe this!<eos> You... really are Robin Hood and his Merry Men!
He wants us out of the way so he can go through with the fug...<eos> Yeah, we need to get the fugu out of here.<eos> Well, we are looking at five years in prison.<eos> Or we let Infeld meet his destiny. You guys are the lawyers.<eos> I'll follow whatever you say.
You know, I say, for a change... we make them the suckers.<eos> So, I think we should get started. Yep.<eos> I'll kick things off.<eos> Actually, I'm sorry.<eos> Please... you go.
It'll put this town out of business.<eos> Motion denied.<eos> Caveat emptor, guys.<eos> If you don't like cocktails or oxygen, don't come to Vegas.<eos> Your honor... if you can rustle up some evidence that showed me the Opal specifically targeted you,
I want to see somebody else," there's lots of other stories that you might want to learn about in the National Gallery.<eos> There are people writing, there are people eating and being surprised, there are people...<eos> You might not believe this but there's an old man over there who's being fed by ravens.<eos> There's a raven, a little black bird that's giving him his food -<eos> All these amazing stories in National Gallery paintings for you to see.
We strip away the colorful diversions that keep us from remembering.<eos> We strip away attachment, fear and love and hatred and anger...<eos> Until we are...<eos> Erased, until we are a blank slate.<eos> We are living reminders of what you try so desperately to forget.
Ah, see, we're not really trying, 'cause we have evidence.<eos> Hard evidence.<eos> You mean Officer Wendy McQuaig?<eos> She goes up on that stand and takes out a colleague, well, hmm. [Clicks tongue]<eos> After you two go back to your lobster races and turning courtrooms into bouncy houses, well, she's gonna have to work around us.
- Okay.<eos> Okay. Go.<eos> Hi. Kids: Trick or treat?<eos> Aren't you kids adorable?<eos> And... You two are big guns.
- Andy's in the other universe!<eos> - Why not?<eos> That's where Ellen liked him and where he was freakishly popular!<eos> He could have used magic to go back there.<eos> You could go back too with the new Element.
Oh, come on.<eos> I knew you were coming for the boat, but all this stuff, too?<eos> We're seizing these items because they were purchased using funds y... you... earned running a, uh, illegal gambling company out of the the...<eos> Oh, my God. You're killing me, kid.<eos> First her, now you guys.
You're foot soldiers.<eos> You start mucking around in the affairs of specialty task forces, it breeds chaos.<eos> And I cannot do my job effectively in chaos.<eos> You bag all this and get it back to the station.<eos> You two ever pull something like this again, you'll be on desk duty until the rapture.
No.<eos> No, it isn't.<eos> You'll be safe in here.<eos> Nothing gets through those doors, I promise.<eos> And you two are going to wait out there?
He didn't say a word.<eos> Maybe the lonely widower was starting to look at you in a more personal way.<eos> Al...<eos> He was more like a brother.<eos> You two spent a lot of time together, feelings build...
He was asking the wrong questions.<eos> What questions are those?<eos> He was looking for...<eos> Faruq Tabrizi.<eos> Just like you are.
People relaxing here.<eos> Well, we can't relax, because this broke down winter shithole has busted cell service, which means Groper's gone limp.<eos> Which means we got to get laid the old-fashioned way.<eos> Why don't you guys just go to a gay bar?<eos> Why don't you just go to a hetero ghetto?
What happened to Danny?<eos> He was arrested for beating up Brad Diver.<eos> Vandalism.<eos> A whole bunch of other stuff.<eos> You know, you guys are like the worst class we ever had in this school.
That's a different question.<eos> Taking care of a problem, Al.<eos> What problem?<eos> Interesting.<eos> You two make yourselves at home.
I've sussed it out.<eos> Is this the code for where he's going to do it?<eos> "The dead shall rise again incorruptible." It's a Bible quote.<eos> I know that, you cheeky bastard.<eos> You know, all of you think I'm just some dumb grunt, don't you?
I know that, you cheeky bastard.<eos> You know, all of you think I'm just some dumb grunt, don't you?<eos> I don't think you're dumb, Gary.<eos> I just think you're like everyone else around here, paranoid and delusional.<eos> Is it any wonder with you ghouls walking about?
We ain't moving, pulse-beater.<eos> - You really want a war?<eos> - Yeah, we do.<eos> You're outnumbered.<eos> You're the one who's going to be outnumbered in a minute.
Never heard it put that way.<eos> - Hey, I'm Jake.<eos> - Jenny.<eos> There you go, you gotta drink.<eos> We're Germany, you're Brazil.
Oh, yeah, that's real funny coming from you.<eos> - Yeah. Get out of my house.<eos> - Hey--<eos> You gave me three fucking days.<eos> Well, I'm taking them back, just like you took your support for the name change, Judas.
You big baby, you're going to put that on me?<eos> You swore your silence.<eos> Now she's God knows where.<eos> Because she got a buffoon for a husband-- an old man on a messed-up acid trip.<eos> You drove her away, not me.
What the fuck are you doing?<eos> I'm trying to make this right.<eos> Are you?<eos> Or are you trying to make yourself feel better because you fucked up?<eos> You didn't kill her.
See what I mean?<eos> Crys, you do realize that Toby doesn't know that you know he killed Wilson, right?<eos> You don't know what he knows.<eos> I know he knows where you live.<eos> And I know he has dozens of plausible reasons for his guys to storm in here and start shooting and you end up accidentally dead.
Lose the gag.<eos> You can talk now if you want.<eos> It's what you're good at, isn't it? You're out of your mind if you think you can get away with this.<eos> Chances are I'm getting a lethal injection, so you don't think I give a fuck what I can get away with, do you?<eos> You, on the other hand, should be very concerned because you're on trial, too, and I'm the judge, so bang-bang-bang, court's in session.
She never stepped out on him again, though.<eos> I mean, you know, things went south for a little while, but they made it right.<eos> You know.<eos> She stuck with him... till she died.<eos> I'm tired of you and me playing games, Pernell.
Well, she sure as shit knows now!<eos> She about jumped out of her skin when she saw me tonight.<eos> And her fucking husband's got some video Caldwell made that's going to blow up his case?<eos> I sincerely doubt that.<eos> You can afford doubt.
You ever read the warning label?<eos> No contraception is 100 percent effective.<eos> But you kept it.<eos> Why?<eos> Because it's a miracle, and you know it.
That never would have happened, Tessie, if you called me first.<eos> You're supposed to consult me before any large purchases.<eos> I will consult with you whenever I damn well please.<eos> This is my money we are dealing with.<eos> You work for me.

Et Voil√†.<eos> So what are you good at?<eos> Escapism.<eos> I could do it for a living when I grow up.<eos> But you're good at it too.
It's really dark.<eos> I go there to look at the stars.<eos> - Is it a meteorite?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> You're the geologist.
Why don't you look for it?<eos> MARRIAGES<eos> Fuck Juli!<eos> You always appear unexpectedly!<eos> - Ditto. - What are you doing here?
What did you say?<eos> Isn't that the Carlana's mare?<eos> She loaned it to the regiment.<eos> Stop being modest.<eos> You got it.
I was left frustrated.<eos> What?<eos> She never let me ride her.<eos> - What are you insinuating?<eos> - Nothing, except... I imagine you have returned the favour.
Anyone would think he had a broom up his arse.<eos> She's pleased with the favour you did her.<eos> What favour?<eos> You got her a certificate that makes her a noble!<eos> - What makes you think that?
- She asked me too.<eos> I was tempted, I must admit.<eos> She's very persuasive.<eos> But if I wanted to buy sex, I'd go to a whore.<eos> I never imagined you, of all people, caught in her web.
She's very persuasive.<eos> But if I wanted to buy sex, I'd go to a whore.<eos> I never imagined you, of all people, caught in her web.<eos> I thought you had strict morals.<eos> - You can talk! - Yes, I can.
Come on, or Mum will tell us off.<eos> Good lad!<eos> Just like a soldier.<eos> I need a poo.<eos> Go on then. You're a big boy now.
That irresponsible liar is now a traitor.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> It's the truth about your friend.<eos> Why should I believe you, when you've lied to me?<eos> - You know all about lying.
- I'll destroy you first.<eos> - Please try.<eos> I'm prepared to take the risk.<eos> I've nothing to lose.<eos> But you can't really say the same.
Slowly, slowly, close your eyes, because you, my little girl, are the sun<eos> that I love the most.<eos> And the moon peeps through into the bedroom<eos> and tells you to go to sleep and not to be afraid.<eos> And in your sleep you play, you play with the stars and fill the sky with joy.
If we write an $18,000 bond check today,<eos> - what's our commission?<eos> - $1,800.<eos> And after taxes, rent, electricity, insurance, salaries, and gas, how long do you think we can keep the lights on for $1,800?<eos> You had some idea we were rich.
Who would imagine we'd be working together like this?<eos> - Pete, are you listening?<eos> - Yeah. Sorry.<eos> We really appreciate you stepping up for the family.<eos> Well, it's... it's what you do.
You're right, Grandma.<eos> I did hear about the stroke.<eos> How?<eos> Well, for the last several years, I've been thinking about the summers I spent here.<eos> You remember what it was like... that green, that shade of green.
It was good.<eos> He found an antique clock we're using for collateral.<eos> Impressive.<eos> Sounds like he's a natural.<eos> Well, you're a natural, too, Julia.
But I still have nightmares about it.<eos> Well, if it's any consolation, I got locked in the trunk of a car today, and it was the worst half hour of my life.<eos> Then my work here is done.<eos> So how old were you?<eos> I was 6, and you were 10.
Man: Gonna put in for newgearoneoftheseeons?<eos> Oh, come on. Me and this armor have been through the shit together.<eos> We got a history.<eos> I can picture it, now.<eos> You, in that suit, planting the martian flag in the statue of Liberty's tiara.
Prep your teams.<eos> Dismissed.<eos> Gunny.<eos> Up here.<eos> I know that you and your team did a rotation on the Donnie.
All right.<eos> Now that we're all done being irradiated, I'm think I'm gonna go.<eos> I'm gonna go check out this famous coffee machine you keep talking about.<eos> Holden: Other way!<eos> If you and I have something we need to get sorted out, we should get to that.
There will be no rerun, brothers and sisters.<eos> The revolution will be live.<eos> Which agency?<eos> I can't say that here in an open hearing, sir.<eos> You saved me.
And you will tell Dar Adal this?<eos> I will.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You must be gratified.<eos> And you're disappointed.
I wish you could stay for Shabbat.<eos> Both boys come with their wives and all the children.<eos> Maybe next time.<eos> I tell them stories about Indiana, being one of eight Jewish families in the entire town.<eos> How you were my protector.
There will be no rerun, brothers and sisters.<eos> The revolution will be live.<eos> Which agency?<eos> I can't say that here in an open hearing, sir.<eos> You saved me.
Well, you must've known she's no fan of the CIA.<eos> This was different.<eos> This was schooled.<eos> "Who's advising her?" That's where my head went.<eos> And then I remembered she's a friend of Otto During and you're a friend of Otto During.
That's not why I wanted to meet you here.<eos> No?<eos> Mnh-mnh. When the towers came down, I was here in this very restaurant, this very seat.<eos> I was.<eos> Roger the ma√É¬Ætre d', and those two... my little friends, you called them.
No!<eos> Not tomorrow!<eos> Today!<eos> Now!<eos> What you looking at?
- And?<eos> - Asked her point blank,<eos> "Are you advising the president-elect?"<eos> - She said no.<eos> - And you believe her?
There.<eos> It was those tiles.<eos> Those are what...<eos> what led me to you.<eos> You flatlined in the ambulance on the way to the hospital.
There will be no rerun, brothers and sisters.<eos> The revolution will be live.<eos> Which agency?<eos> I can't say that here in an open hearing, sir.<eos> You saved me.
- He confirmed it.<eos> In addition to the trip to Samjiyon, he had business with First Emirates in Abu Dhabi to the tune of 120 million dollars.<eos> You sound convinced already. So why are you here asking me?<eos> We started something, Majid.<eos> Three years ago, you and I did.
Saul, what does it matter anyway?<eos> Half your country will wake up tomorrow convinced that we're cheating, and half of mine will wake up chanting, "Death to America."<eos> I still need the truth.<eos> That is the truth.<eos> Only you would call it succeeding.
Only you would call it succeeding.<eos> I forced you into this.<eos> You're right about that.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - But I think you take more pride in what we accomplished than you let on.
That's good.<eos> Dar didn't like being outmaneuvered.<eos> - This was his reaction.<eos> - Yeah, I saw.<eos> I think we handled it in the press conference, but you know better than anyone, Dar will come back at us.
What now?<eos> Tovah will be here in the morning.<eos> In the morning.<eos> It's like that, is it?<eos> You fuck with us, we fuck with you.
Have a look.<eos> We're all just trying to figure out what happened here.<eos> It's pretty clear what happened.<eos> No, I don't think so.<eos> I don't even think you think so.
NYPD has got him in isolation at Bellevue.<eos> Do you even listen to yourself?<eos> You put that kid back on the street.<eos> Live with it.<eos> Yeah, I am living with it, but you live with this.
There will be no rerun, brothers and sisters.<eos> The revolution will be live.<eos> Which agency?<eos> I can't say that here in an open hearing, sir.<eos> You saved me.
And are we careful?<eos> Yes.<eos> When we need to be.<eos> But right now, we're at home, and it's time to get ready for school, just like any other day.<eos> Because you are safe and I'm safe.
But...<eos> The problem is, they know it must have come from the NSA.<eos> Your organization's gonna be looking internally, so it's not gonna be enough just to say that.<eos> I didn't give it to you. Really.<eos> You came to me, you asked me to violate 50 federal laws.
I was up here anyway, briefing the president-elect at the Millbrook offsite.<eos> What's she make of it?<eos> The bombing?<eos> I'd say she's still processing.<eos> You could tell, though, she's... not chastened, exactly, but a little more open.
That's not a good idea.<eos> Here.<eos> Text him.<eos> Don't make this worse.<eos> - Shh. - You can end this.
Yes...<eos> Majid... for Chrissake.<eos> What?<eos> No loose ends.<eos> You taught me that, Saul.
No.<eos> Want to tell me why?<eos> If you won't say what's bothering you, how am I supposed to help?<eos> You tried to kill me.<eos> The guy you sent.
- What the fuck did you do?<eos> You sound terrible.<eos> I told you to leave him alone.<eos> And I told you there were other opinions.<eos> You answer to me, you fuck.
And I told you there were other opinions.<eos> You answer to me, you fuck.<eos> To me, you hear that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do. But you need to hear, too.
- Counterintelligence.<eos> They'll find you.<eos> They always do.<eos> Not if you don't tell them where I am.<eos> If I can get to Athens-- And I think I can-- only you and Father Matsoukis know about the rectory.
Because she's the one asking me to fall on my sword.<eos> Elizabeth Keane is?<eos> Yes.<eos> Honestly, Saul, none of this sounds like you.<eos> You're not just gonna pack up and leave her to the wolves.
Truth won't put a dent in that.<eos> So you say do nothing.<eos> Not nothing.<eos> Change the subject.<eos> And you agree?
Yeah, I'm interested.<eos> All right, so...<eos> - Hey, watch it.<eos> - Uh, sorry, sorry.<eos> - You're Carrie.
All right, so...<eos> - Hey, watch it.<eos> - Uh, sorry, sorry.<eos> - You're Carrie.<eos> - Who are you?
That hardly qualified as a conversation.<eos> I wasn't doing too much talking that day.<eos> I noticed.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> Well, you knew him better than anybody.
I noticed.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> Well, you knew him better than anybody.<eos> I guess I was expecting you to get up and say a few words.<eos> Well, maybe I didn't know him as well as you think.
I wasn't judging you, Carrie.<eos> Sure sounded like it.<eos> The worst happened.<eos> Quinn died.<eos> You're still out there going a million miles an hour.
Not many people in that room voted for us,<eos> I'll give you that, but nobody in there was responsible for those leaks.<eos> How can you be sure?<eos> Because I've known them forever.<eos> Because, as corny as it sounds, what they care about most is their country, and because they hate the press more than you do.
Captain Keane, what did he do?<eos> It was dark.<eos> You know, there was a lot of noise.<eos> But he was there, right?<eos> You saw him.
We've spent our entire careers seeing around corners.<eos> If there's something I need to know, you should tell me.<eos> We need to take precautions, Majid.<eos> You don't have many friends here.<eos> Neither, it seems, do you.
So we returned fire.<eos> Captain Keane, what did he do?<eos> - There was a lot of noise--<eos> - But he was there, right?<eos> - You saw him.
Who told you that?<eos> You only care because you got f-found out.<eos> No.<eos> Quinn...<eos> Y-You did this to me!
Well, they're leaving.<eos> I left you a thing to find the key, the door code.<eos> You can get in.<eos> It's true what you said last night-- about Berlin.<eos> I told myself... I was doing what you would want me to do, preventing an attack.
I didn't.<eos> Where is it?<eos> Nowhere.<eos> Ah. You deleted it from your phone.<eos> Did you, uh... send it somewhere?
And the other thing about me is, like, I give zero fucks about anything, yet I have a strong opinion about everything, even topics I'm not informed on.<eos> And I have to tell you that I read your "Modern Love" piece, and, for me, I was just fixated.<eos> I was like, what, like, the fuck?<eos> Your best friend, so-called best friend, and then your boyfriend going at it. Just...<eos> And you just have to sit there and fucking take it?
Okay.<eos> Sure, yeah.<eos> I'll just...<eos> I'll just crash with Shosh, then.<eos> Baby, you live at Adam's.
Plus, he's gay.<eos> - I can hear you.<eos> - Congratulations.<eos> - Now you know that I think you're gay.<eos> - You're gay.
I actually texted, saying that I... needed to crash here for a while.<eos> I might come by.<eos> Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, you did.<eos> I remember.<eos> Yeah, but you didn't... you didn't respond.
See how the flesh is uncorrupted.<eos> A miracle.<eos> You will take his hand, Lord... and swear your oath.<eos> Uhtred...<eos> You are the commander of my household troops.
You know, that poor woman lived across the bridge in that horrible encampment for three years just to be close to her husband.<eos> And when they finally allowed her back in, she pitched her tent right at the base of that pillar and took care of him every single day, even though he never acknowledged her, never gave a word of thanks.<eos> Her loyalty and devotion,<eos> I've never seen anything like it.<eos> Except when you did it for Mary.
And she asked me to promise-- promise-- not to say anything, but I didn't lie, Nora.<eos> I did not lie.<eos> He deserves a legacy.<eos> Can't you give a man a little grace?<eos> So, are you gonna dig him up or should I?
Thanks.<eos> Do I know you, mate?<eos> I sure hope not.<eos> - Good afternoon.<eos> You must be Sharon.
Oh, yeah, sure.<eos> We all know each other.<eos> It's a tiny country.<eos> I know Chris.<eos> You're the fella that landed on him.
So, I went to him, to Kevin, and I asked for his help.<eos> And when he refused, I drowned him... Because I thought he was testing me.<eos> Because I thought he'd come back. And once I'd proven my faith, he would have no choice but to help me talk to my children one last time.<eos> So, I thought you were sent by God. Sent with a message just for me.<eos> But you're not an angel.
What the fuck is going on?<eos> What?<eos> I have compassion for you because you are ill.<eos> I wanted to help.<eos> She told me to tell you that I was who you thought I was and then you'd go away.
- Just give me... give me a minute.<eos> - Kevin?<eos> - What the fuck did you do?<eos> I just... I need you to calm down and just tell me what happened.<eos> What happened is that I went to see Evie and she told me that you fucking called her.
What's wrong?<eos> You can tell me anything.<eos> No, I can't.<eos> Why not?<eos> The last time I told you everything, I woke up handcuffed to a bed and you were gone.
But the explosion...<eos> They said all flights have been grounded.<eos> All nonessential flights.<eos> Military and foreign aid are exempted.<eos> And you, Arturo... are not only a valued member of our congregation, but licensed by an internationally recognized NGO.
Upset about what, exactly?<eos> Because I'm getting the feeling we're not hearing the entire story.<eos> No, the whole story, Matt, is in your ridiculous book, which somehow you convinced my husband and my stepson to keep from me.<eos> Yeah, well, they kept it from you 'cause they knew this would be your reaction.<eos> Do you think it's ridiculous, John?
"Be not deceived."<eos> God shall not be mocked.<eos> "For whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap."<eos> No, we're not reaping anyone, man.<eos> You used to burn men's houses down for pretending to be things they're not.
I threw it overboard.<eos> It was just getting good.<eos> You know how it ends.<eos> What makes you say that?<eos> Because you know everything.
Because you know everything.<eos> You're being sarcastic.<eos> I was just wondering why I haven't been struck down by lightning yet. Why don't you, transform those ropes into serpents and free yourself?<eos> I don't need to do that.<eos> You're going to untie me once you get what you want.
You'll tell the captain and the authorities?<eos> No.<eos> Why not?<eos> Because I'm the authority.<eos> Right, you're the authority on everything... creation, Isaac and Abraham, the decathlon.
Know your cancer's back, tell no one... get no treatment, pray for divine fucking intervention.<eos> - That's not fair.<eos> - Yes, it is.<eos> I deserve that.<eos> You... you don't wanna kill yourself.
Oh, fuck my parents.<eos> I wanna talk to my kids.<eos> I just told you, Nora.<eos> We don't do departures.<eos> You did departures when you and your pals had life-size replicas made of my family and then sat them down at my kitchen table.
He's still with Nora.<eos> And where is Nora?<eos> Uh, sorry. I can't disclose that.<eos> You can't disclose it?<eos> Look, when we all found Nora in the hotel, you said you were going to the airport to be with Kevin.
And he wasn't there.<eos> So, I called him and he actually answered his phone.<eos> He said he was here and that we should come.<eos> - So, why didn't you tell me?<eos> - Because you don't believe in this.
Ah, Jesus, that's good.<eos> Remember when we went to coffee for the first time, just you and me?<eos> Of course I do.<eos> I was hurting.<eos> You reached across the table, took my hands, and looked at me, and I felt like I could've told you anything.
Wake me when he comes back.<eos> Truth is, along with our missing fucking savior, we also appear to be short some apostles.<eos> Our friend Matthew conspicuously absent.<eos> Fortunately, I will play the part of Peter.<eos> You are already John.
Somebody who was there at Christ's last huzzah.<eos> So, that would make me Mary Magdalene.<eos> Mm, that would be Nora.<eos> Also conspicuously absent.<eos> You, Dr. Garvey, are one apostle, and one apostle only.
Doubting Thomas.<eos> Mm. When I first started hearing voices back in Mapleton, everyone around me told me I was fucking nuts.<eos> Everyone.<eos> Except you.<eos> You were the one person who believed me.
And they'd take us to the movies and bowling and Putt-Putt just to keep us busy?<eos> Of course I do.<eos> And this one time, they brought us to a baseball game, and I was too young to get the rules, so I... I watched these people in another section hitting a beach ball.<eos> And the whole stadium was getting into it.<eos> And when the ball came over to our seats, you stood up and you just whacked it.
That's why we're fucking doing this.<eos> It's not why he's doing this.<eos> Why else would I be doing this?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Why would you?
I don't wanna do this anymore.<eos> Do what, Mr. President?<eos> Stop fucking calling me that!<eos> I'm not the president!<eos> You're not the fucking Secretary of Defense.
Stop fucking calling me that!<eos> I'm not the president!<eos> You're not the fucking Secretary of Defense.<eos> Oh, yes, yes, I am.<eos> You named me Secretary of Defense.
Excuse me?<eos> Excuse me, but you're lying.<eos> You're just...<eos> You're just saying what we want to hear.<eos> You invited me here, and then you rejected me.
Do you want to come with me instead?<eos> I think, dear sister, that defeats the purpose.<eos> What are you going to tell people about me?<eos> About what happened here?<eos> Whatever you want me to.
- Sorry? You showed a picture of me to the nun at the convent.<eos> That's how you found out where I lived.<eos> Why would I have a picture of you?<eos> I just came from there.<eos> - She told me that you asked if I...
Kevin, fucking Kevin.<eos> - He found me.<eos> - What?<eos> He's... He's there in Australia?<eos> Did you tell him where I was, Laurie?
- Really? - Yeah, really.<eos> Wanna see my scar?<eos> She came!<eos> You said she wouldn't come.<eos> I'm just as surprised as you are.
Wait.<eos> I'll confess.<eos> I'll do anything, just tell me what it is.<eos> It's simple.<eos> You tell me your sins.
He understood his faults.<eos> He felt remorse for the twisted life that he was leading.<eos> Clearly, it was you.<eos> Feeding him the apple.<eos> You were the temptation all along.
Don't do this!<eos> You're just this poor lost girl.<eos> Come here.<eos> I understand.<eos> You just needed him to be stronger.
I'm sorry, I'll do anything.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> And your struggle will bring you closer.<eos> You... have sinned.
But she can be saved.<eos> If you keep quiet and pay your penance like a good true believer.<eos> Then she can be saved.<eos> But if not then I guess you two will just have to trade places.<eos> And you will get to watch.
You won't.<eos> You won't feel anything anymore.<eos> Just like I don't.<eos> I spent so long trying to hide my rage.<eos> Then you taught me the truth.
It won't be happening.<eos> I assume there is some token number I must actually deliver for appearance's sake.<eos> How many that is I...<eos> I honestly couldn't say.<eos> You're the captain now that Teach is dead, yes?
How many that is I...<eos> I honestly couldn't say.<eos> You're the captain now that Teach is dead, yes?<eos> I am.<eos> Then you choose.
Turns out it wasn't nearly so long as I thought it would be.<eos> Before Blackbeard decided he could do better than me.<eos> Is there a point you're trying to make?<eos> You're counseling Long John Silver to be reasonable.<eos> Hmm? To do what you want him to do instead of what he wants to do.
He asks you for a name, you don't say shit.<eos> And you let him take me.<eos> Another name, Captain.<eos> Captain?<eos> Will you be choosing or will I?
Sure.. I get my men back in exchange for you.<eos> But something tells me... if I free you, you'll find a way to be a problem for me again, and soon.<eos> Of course not.<eos> Why would I do that?<eos> When you and I last saw each other... you had every reason to see me killed.
I'm sorry for what happened today.<eos> The moment I realized what was about to happen, I sent men to find you.<eos> I'm just thankful we were able to get you in time.<eos> You are sorry... for what happened today.<eos> What happened today... was exactly what I have been warning you about from the moment you and your husband first arrived here.
For the moment, Nassau town is lost.<eos> That much is painfully clear.<eos> It is our duty now to secure ourselves here.<eos> I think we're all properly angry about what he did on the Underhill estate, but Billy has influence that is best not ignored.<eos> Billy told me I should worry that you will be Madi's end.
It was agreed that in addition to guaranteeing the safe departure from the island of her and all her people... that we would retrieve and surrender to her the cache of gems remaining from the Urca gold.<eos> It guarantees a quick victory to a fight we'd otherwise be far from guaranteed to win.<eos> Guaranteed?<eos> When is anything ever...?<eos> And you agreed to this?
The transport will meet us there.<eos> This wasn't part of the deal.<eos> Sailing a fortune in jewels into that harbor in full view of a beach filled with enraged pirates, you can understand his reluctance.<eos> This way, there will be far less risk of anyone disturbing the exchange.<eos> I saw his face when you accepted this deal, and I imagine you did, too.
Tell Silver it's important we wait until they've all cleared the tunnel before we make any kind of move.<eos> When the time comes, I don't want anyone else touching Flint.<eos> I'll handle it.<eos> This isn't right.<eos> All those men out there that you and I have fought alongside.
I'll handle it.<eos> This isn't right.<eos> All those men out there that you and I have fought alongside.<eos> I can't believe I'm the only one who knows this isn't right.<eos> You built all of this.
Long John Silver.<eos> All he had to do was open his mouth, say your name, and everyone listened.<eos> What was it that he said about me?<eos> He said the reason Flint's fleet never got warning of the barricade in the harbor wasn't because Mr. Featherstone didn't relay it... wasn't because Max intercepted it.<eos> He said it was because you never sent it in the first place.
Stand down. Just wait!<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> We escaped the governor's men.<eos> Came back to rejoin the fight, but didn't know if the harbor was safe to enter.<eos> What are you doing here?
It won't work.<eos> It's done. It's already agreed to.<eos> She agreed to it.<eos> Her people agreed.<eos> You've agreed.
Don't even.<eos> Stupid sea pigeon, looking at me like that.<eos> Please!<eos> You're also at the beach with no friends.
Wait, Titus.<eos> Why are you back?<eos> Sometimes cruises just end early.<eos> It's a very common thing.<eos> I think I know more about cruises than you do.
I am a star!<eos> Wait, you played the lead part?<eos> What happened to Dionne Warwick?<eos> Nothing, she's fine!<eos> I think I know more about Dionne Warwick than you do!
-He kidnapped me.<eos> -I said, "Or whatever."<eos> But now he wants something from you, right?<eos> A divorce so he can get remarried.<eos> Which means now you're the one in control.
I mean, cool, cool.<eos> The '70s...<eos> Let's schedule him first up and, have a nice selection of pastries for him.<eos> Nothing with fruit.<eos> Okay, maybe I'll sign if you admit that there was no fifth Mole Woman and you were Lil' Lisa.
Do you, Titus?<eos> I said, "I want chocolate."<eos> And then what did you say, Titus?<eos> Y-you'll get it?<eos> So you give Mr. Frumpus what he wants, and you get what you want-- one of the best TV jobs in New York.
We're blown, the whole squad.<eos> - Grimes and I are the only ones left.<eos> Three people had access to our new names:<eos> the directors of CIA, NSA and CTU, which is now Keith Mullins.<eos> You're the one who chose me as your replacement.
Keep monitoring police networks.<eos> Find Carter and Grimes.<eos> The Americans probably have the list by now.<eos> Your operation's failed, Jad.<eos> You failed.
No, we have men and weapons.<eos> We move now, pick a target and launch our own attack.<eos> We're here to finish what my father started.<eos> I respect you as his son, but you're not a soldier like him.<eos> Your father fought the enemy from caves while you were studying at Oxford.
Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey.<eos> I told him I was texting with someone from Chechnya, but it was over.<eos> That I explained everything to you, and you believed it.
Oh, Rebecca could help us out there.<eos> - You'll still take a hit.<eos> - Well, the hit I can take.<eos> It's the not swinging back, that's what bothers me.<eos> Standing up for the truth the way you did, it's what I've been telling the American people I'm gonna do for them.
Ben.<eos> - Where are you?<eos> - I need more time.<eos> Right, so CTU can track me.<eos> So I can get the list and you can get the money.
_<eos> I think Amira's gonna do something.<eos> He thinks you're planning an attack at the school with someone.<eos> He doesn't know it's with me.<eos> I told him I've explained everything to you and you believed it.
He was the one you were texting? !<eos> I was beginning to think this was gonna happen without you.<eos> The party asked John to run four years ago.<eos> He knew I couldn't track Bin-Khalid and work on his campaign at the same time.<eos> Standing up for the truth the way you did... It's what I've been telling the American people I'm gonna do for them.
Ben is counter-surveillance trained, okay?<eos> He's also very paranoid.<eos> Carter, Grimes has already gotten away from you once.<eos> We can't let that happen again.<eos> Eric, you and I were operating alone because we didn't know who we could trust.
Andy.<eos> I'm sorry I've been shutting you out.<eos> Look, I'm not happy about the way things ended.<eos> Things didn't just end.<eos> You ended them.
Nicole.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Thank God you're all right.<eos> I'm sorry I haven't called you before now.<eos> It's okay, as long as you're safe.
All right, man, listen, I'm here.<eos> I'm on the train. Where are you, Ben?<eos> Where are you?<eos> Right here.<eos> But you're staying right there.
You've known me for years, John.<eos> You've met my family, my parents.<eos> How can you possibly think I'm part of this?<eos> What am I supposed to think?<eos> If you were in my shoes, what would you think?
John, the sooner you accept that Nilaa is not who you thought she was, the sooner you can... begin to recover from the damage she's done.<eos> You're not surprised by all this?<eos> Nilaa supporting terrorists?<eos> Well...<eos> I mean, you know her as well as I do.
I want to finish questioning her, Keith.<eos> Right now, I need something else from you.<eos> What?<eos> I'm briefing the DNI in about five minutes.<eos> You're the expert on Bin-Khalid and what he was planning.
Why limit the operation to you and Grimes?<eos> If he really knows Gabriel's location, why not go in hard, send in a tac team?<eos> Because if Gabriel is not on site, then we've shown our hand.<eos> We'll never find him.<eos> On what pretext would you and Grimes make this approach?
Why would I do that?<eos> Because you blame yourself for what happened today.<eos> Look, Rebecca, I told you and Mullins what I think.<eos> And right now, I don't see any other option.<eos> Do you?
Yeah, w-without blinking.<eos> But it never occurred to me how you could do something that would be so horrible.<eos> I think, at the very least, you need to tell me why.<eos> Wasn't me.<eos> Wasn't you.
People inside the campaign were already whispering about me before the Gage ad.<eos> Now they'll never stop.<eos> My reputation's destroyed.<eos> How do I go back to my job now?<eos> How do I just go back to my life, knowing what you and John really think of me?
Keep working.<eos> I know that was hard, Amira.<eos> But you had to do it.<eos> You had no choice.<eos> You and I are going to be part of something greater than ourselves.
More of y'all got to be involved.<eos> Here's how we gonna do this.<eos> Bring Kevin in.<eos> Jerome tried to sell me out.<eos> And you're his little brother.
You got to talk to Isaac.<eos> This is none of my business.<eos> I left to get away from all this.<eos> I just want to get back to my husband.<eos> You think anybody here wouldn't kill to get out like you did?
Look.<eos> I'm asking you to talk to him.<eos> And say what?<eos> I've never seen him like this before.<eos> That's 'cause he wasn't like this when you and Eric were around.
That's 'cause he wasn't like this when you and Eric were around.<eos> Once you two bounced, everything changed.<eos> I know Eric leaving was rough for him.<eos> It wasn't Eric.<eos> It was you leaving that broke him.
The police never got anything out of him.<eos> But in the village, people talk.<eos> There were rumors he trained in Pakistan.<eos> That he wasn't alone.<eos> You were there with him.
You're coming home with me.<eos> You, too, boy.<eos> We're not going anywhere.<eos> You think you're a man, because you can shoot a gun?<eos> I fought the Russians while you hid under the bed in your pajamas crying like girl!
You have no proof of that.<eos> Only because you're good at what you do.<eos> Which means I can't fire you for cause... yet.<eos> But I don't trust you.<eos> I understood siding with Rebecca when all this started, but Carter's gone off the reservation, and you... - helped him do it.
Make it quick, Nicole.<eos> You gonna go through every call on every one of those phones?<eos> Uh-huh. If that's what it takes.<eos> Isaac, look, I know you don't trust anyone right now.<eos> You think?
I swear on my wife's grave, I've never even heard of this Jaballa person.<eos> And how would I get the identities of those Rangers?<eos> Rebecca, you know me, we're family.<eos> We've spent Christmases together.<eos> You and John were married in my backyard.
Okay, let's keep him on ice till this plays out.<eos> What's Locke's E.T.A.?<eos> We got one satellite feed on the property Jadalla's holed up in, waiting for a second to come online.<eos> You can also piggyback into traffic cams from District D.O.T.<eos> Of course, you already knew that.
But we had them.<eos> I had them!<eos> I found them.<eos> For you.<eos> I tracked Jadalla, and you and your men lost them.
Horrifying, isn't it?<eos> But based on the images we have seen so far, we can speculate that the number of fatalities could easily be within the 100 range...<eos> Of course it is.<eos> It's disgusting.<eos> But if you think this will make Eric do what you want, you're wrong.
Oh, God.<eos> Isaac.<eos> I was worried about you.<eos> I'm all right.<eos> You're okay?
Andy... remember, be sure Jadalla believes I'm forcing you to do this.<eos> Follow my lead.<eos> Okay.<eos> Mr. Carter.<eos> And you must be Mr. Shalowitz.
So does your brother.<eos> The way he looks at your wife...<eos> I was so blind to the truth.<eos> Until my father died.<eos> Until you murdered him.
Until my father died.<eos> Until you murdered him.<eos> I should thank you.<eos> Thank me?<eos> You're the reason I'm here today.
He's just finished the first three algorithm branches.<eos> Just one more to go and the list will be whole again.<eos> Once we have it, send the activation codes to all sleeper cells.<eos> You hear that?<eos> Very soon, we launch a wave of attacks like you in this country have never seen before.
- Andy?<eos> You need to get out of there, now, Andy.<eos> You and Carter.<eos> Really?<eos> You think?
It's over.<eos> No, no, it's not, no.<eos> We have not come this far just so you can throw it away.<eos> No.<eos> For the record, you are the one who threw it away.
I... I don't understand.<eos> Jadalla's men broke him out of CTU.<eos> John was on his way here to see me and they took him.<eos> He's gone, Henry, and right now, we have no way to get him back.<eos> You were in contact with Jadalla.
To see his son come back to him.<eos> Before he could reveal himself, he had to make sure that your heart was truly with his.<eos> I'm sorry, Father.<eos> No.<eos> I came to finish what you started and... I failed you.
Excuse me.<eos> How we doing?<eos> Hello.<eos> John Donovan's execution in front of the world would make a powerful statement.<eos> But he is not our enemy, you are.
How we doing?<eos> Hello.<eos> John Donovan's execution in front of the world would make a powerful statement.<eos> But he is not our enemy, you are.<eos> You are the one who dedicated your life to hunting us down.
I went back to the house to change clothes, and I found this... in the mess.<eos> The way this reads, you've been talking to Rebecca for months about joining CTU.<eos> To be honest, it was just something I was considering.<eos> I'm not even not even sure I wanted it.<eos> Eric, this morning, when you asked me why I started taking birth control, and I said I thought you still needed more time, do you remember what you said to me?
Jadalla and Naseri... they want to stage my execution.<eos> They want to show the world that they can defeat the woman who tried to destroy them.<eos> They're gonna want to kill me themselves.<eos> You want to use yourself as bait.<eos> And I want you to finish them off.
I still have provisional status.<eos> Good... 'cause I'm-a need a few things.<eos> We'll be leaving soon to meet your wife, but let me ask you something, Senator.<eos> How does it feel to be married to a monster, huh?<eos> You're the monster.
That is why you had to make your own journey.<eos> I'll never leave you again, Father.<eos> And I will never forsake you.<eos> We will fight, Jadalla, father and son.<eos> We will fight until our enemies fall... and then... you will take my place.
You came here to get an answer from Eric.<eos> You got your answer.<eos> I don't like seeing you like this.<eos> Look at me.<eos> When you and Eric walked out on me, one thought kept me going.
Look at me.<eos> When you and Eric walked out on me, one thought kept me going.<eos> That you was moving on to something better.<eos> Maybe it hasn't worked out that way.<eos> What I'm trying to say... It's looking like I'm gonna be starting over and... if you feel like you might need to start over, too...
That you was moving on to something better.<eos> Maybe it hasn't worked out that way.<eos> What I'm trying to say... It's looking like I'm gonna be starting over and... if you feel like you might need to start over, too...<eos> You don't have to answer now.<eos> You and Eric got some talking to do.
Have they locked down Rebecca and Carter?<eos> Dispatch says the deputies aren't responding.<eos> - We've only got a few minutes.<eos> - We're not far.<eos> You drive ahead, I'll follow on foot.
I want you to move to the center of the field.<eos> Did you hear me?<eos> I hear you.<eos> But I'm not moving until you release my husband.<eos> No, you are not making the demands here.
Look at your husband.<eos> Now do what I say, or my men will put a bullet in his head.<eos> I don't believe you'll do that.<eos> It's me you want.<eos> You told me yourself.
Rebecca, you're not seriously considering this.<eos> They want to stage my execution.<eos> They're gonna want to kill me themselves.<eos> You want to use yourself as bait.<eos> And I want you to finish them off.
You want to use yourself as bait.<eos> And I want you to finish them off.<eos> I'm in.<eos> Father?<eos> I came to finish what you started.
I failed you.<eos> You did not fail.<eos> You came home.<eos> How does it feel to be married to a monster?<eos> You're the monster.
That'll save some American lives.<eos> I should have thought that being married to Rebecca would have opened your eyes by now.<eos> Why would you say something like that?<eos> Because your wife understands how the world operates.<eos> I think I've learned enough about Rebecca to know that, yes, she-she's willing to push some boundaries, but she would never do what you've done.
Don't move.<eos> Hands.<eos> On the floor.<eos> Now.<eos> Who the hell are you?
I wish I could help you, John.<eos> It's over.<eos> You can't keep this secret anymore.<eos> Why would you kill this girl?<eos> Because without the girl, all you have are some files on my server.
Senator, we're almost there.<eos> I'll reach out the moment I have anything new.<eos> You think you're saving your wife, John?<eos> Once this gets out, she'll wish she was dead.<eos> Well, you seem to have lived with it just fine.
You working late?<eos> I hope not.<eos> You need to start thinking about that eulogy.<eos> I know, I will.<eos> I'm ready when you are.
How about a weekend away?<eos> It can be a work thing.<eos> Right?<eos> Like a conference or a workshop.<eos> Whatever you want.
I did not want this.<eos> Flint is my friend, but I know what he is.<eos> I have no illusions about it.<eos> But for all the dangers he presents, for all his offenses... the one thing he's never done is force me to choose between him and you.<eos> That, you did.
Move!<eos> If they report our position, we'll face 50 more of them. Stay.<eos> Watch the house.<eos> It did affect me.<eos> When Mr. Scott... when your father told me that you and your mother had died... it affected me a great deal.
Just now, that man and several others wondered aloud whether the smartest thing to do wouldn't be killing you and throwing you in the sea rather than giving you another opportunity to fuck us!<eos> For reasons I can't begin to fathom, I argued against it.<eos> Bark at me again about braver, stronger, and smarter men, and I might decide to revisit the issue!<eos> If killing me seems like the smartest thing to do, then it is obvious to me none of you have any idea how to defeat Woodes Rogers.<eos> - And you do?
They've both been through there in recent months.<eos> Trying to agree on what kind of resistance we'd likely face.<eos> How is she?<eos> She's breathing.<eos> How are you?
They all turned on me.<eos> Discarded what I'd done for them, the sacrifices I made, and left me for dead.<eos> And I want them all to pay for it.<eos> I cannot achieve it on my own.<eos> You could... if you were so inclined and you knew how.
But we're not going to permit him to kill her either.<eos> You cannot guarantee that...<eos> We will sail to Nassau under cover of night.<eos> We will find her. We will kill anyone who stands in our way. And we will bring her home.<eos> When you and I are of the same mind... there is nothing we have not yet been able to do.
We will find her. We will kill anyone who stands in our way. And we will bring her home.<eos> When you and I are of the same mind... there is nothing we have not yet been able to do.<eos> I believe that.<eos> I trust it.<eos> Do you?
I'll have to find him, get through the army of maroons he calls allies, get through Long John Silver and the animal whose leash he now holds.<eos> And somehow escape it all alive... all without you.<eos> But even if you could do all those things...<eos> I mean, how could you be someone who would do that?<eos> The world would know that you were the one to betray every last one of our brothers.
I do it for us.<eos> That's how it started.<eos> That's how it's going to end.<eos> We should be going.<eos> You'll, you know...
Grown so used to the yoke that there can be no progress without it.<eos> It's a lot to ask... to wager so much suffering on blind faith.<eos> Well, it isn't entirely faith.<eos> We'll have the right people in place to lead us through it and hold the world together while it finds its balance.<eos> You think so much of what you and I can accomplish together.
Yesterday, he had nothing.<eos> He was shouting at the rain.<eos> Now you've given him all he needs to kill this war dead.<eos> My God.<eos> The number of times I have followed you blindly, backed you with the men blindly, put men in the fucking ground... Good men, friends... because you said, "I know the way."
I'd like to put you in charge of Nassau.<eos> But on this particular issue, the world won't much care for what I'd like.<eos> And of the men available, this one has merits.<eos> His family would be relieved beyond measure that he'd found himself a future far away from their business.<eos> He'd come with money, he'd open doors to new partners... and he'd be most amenable to doing whatever else you told him to do.
Mr. Silver, I fear, is compromised in this regard.<eos> At this moment... I find myself in need of a new partner.<eos> I knew it would come to this.<eos> I tried to tell him.<eos> We fight, only two outcomes I can see... I die or you die.
All right.<eos> Although, you know that isn't true either.<eos> Why isn't it true?<eos> I'm sorry, the more I try and dismiss this, I...<eos> You know my story.
The latest in a line of ill-fated partners, situating yourself such that... were you and I ever to come to blows...<eos> I'd be forced to hesitate before doing you any harm.<eos> - Slow down, I...<eos> - I'm not angry with you.<eos> It's just... you know my story.
Then I'll take you to it.<eos> Hold on to this for as long as you can, for all of us who once had it... and walked away.<eos> You have no idea the restraint this takes.<eos> How urgent the instinct towards violence.<eos> How certain the conviction that it would be deserved, given what you and your partners have destroyed,
We need to get it in the ground.<eos> Come on.<eos> Heard some talk in the camp before we left.<eos> They were talking about what happens when it's over... if the war ends up what everyone says it will be... about the spoils we all stand to gain from it.<eos> But what you're talking about is bigger than that, isn't it?
He'll come round.<eos> Once she's safe, then he'll be able to see things clearly again.<eos> I hope so.<eos> If not, if he needs to go...<eos> You're too important to what comes next to have to bear a burden like that.
Even if you could kill me, even if that somehow helped you see her alive again, how are you going to explain it to her?<eos> She believes in this as much as I do.<eos> You know this.<eos> If it costs the war to save her, you'll have lost her anyway.<eos> Even you cannot construct a story to make her forgive you that.
I know there's no way that one of us is ever gonna be in charge of them.<eos> Which means that your boss, Mr. Croome, is back there somewhere.<eos> I want him in here.<eos> Now.<eos> - You don't understand.
The project was shit.<eos> The director: shit.<eos> The screenplay: total shit.<eos> I thought you loved the script.<eos> I loved what you were going to bring to it.
- This is my fault.<eos> - No, it's my fault.<eos> I never carry my share.<eos> - That is not true.<eos> You're working.

If your big sister is listening, what would you like to say to her?<eos> Big sister... please, do the right thing.<eos> Please turn yourself in before anyone else gets hurt.<eos> Sorry.<eos> If you didn't, I would have.
Sapiens live in a world designed by their worst fears.<eos> And nothing terrifies them like difference.<eos> You save your fucking justifications.<eos> You murdered an innocent girl.<eos> I know you killed Sara Patrell.
Why do soldiers kill themselves?<eos> Or cops?<eos> People who bear the full weight of the truth sometimes break, Will.<eos> Angelica broke.<eos> Just like one day you or I might break.

- I'm not interested in playing at all.<eos> Wolfgang, I'm sorry I lied about the Fuchs meeting, but it's getting very complicated.<eos> You know what's going on, don't you?<eos> Fuchs left town.<eos> You're following Volker.
You can't win a fight protecting yourself.<eos> Nomi?<eos> A coded media alert can make it almost impossible for cops to respond fast enough.<eos> Not just the plan. What do you think about the risk itself?<eos> Your life is either defined by the system... or by the way you defy the system.
Okay.<eos> The parade kicks off after your address.<eos> My address?<eos> Only if you want.<eos> It is for you to decide.
- Must've been on blockers when we met.<eos> Ding.<eos> Bowling ball continues to impress.<eos> Hey, ask him how he avoids BPO.<eos> Ask him if you and I can have just a quick fuck.
Give me a call when you get bored of you-know-who.<eos> Can you tell me where you get your blockers?<eos> I make them myself, puttanella.<eos> Listen, the hardest part is getting the samples without a leash around my neck.<eos> But lucky you seem to already have yours, the latest ones with less side effects.
Just the things that matter.<eos> These are the last year reports from the controller general.<eos> Yeah, you can just put them there.<eos> - Thank you. - You're welcome.<eos> About last night... I... needed you and you were there for me.
- Thank you. - You're welcome.<eos> About last night... I... needed you and you were there for me.<eos> But it was wrong.<eos> Why?<eos> You know why.
What's true is that married women like to fantasize.<eos> - It's what keeps marriages together.<eos> - No.<eos> I don't. I... I must not.<eos> Okay, you're in Bombay, I'm in Berlin.
I think you're safe.<eos> Please.<eos> Last night made me realize that I can't be trusted with my thoughts.<eos> Come on, Wolfie! Let's finish Fuchs' Fucks!<eos> I need help and you have to help me.
I think it had a lot to do with these people inviting you.<eos> Of course.<eos> I mean, it has over a million views.<eos> - Really?<eos> - You haven't watched it?
That was fun.<eos> It was.<eos> - Last time we were here...<eos> - we both felt trapped.<eos> You were afraid of going to prison.
- Last time we were here...<eos> - we both felt trapped.<eos> You were afraid of going to prison.<eos> Now I miss it.<eos> You wanted so badly to see your father.
- we both felt trapped.<eos> You were afraid of going to prison.<eos> Now I miss it.<eos> You wanted so badly to see your father.<eos> And you felt like you were making a terrible mistake.
Is this one of yours?<eos> Yeah.<eos> He thought you were as hot as I do.<eos> But right now, all he thinks is that you're lying.<eos> What do you think?
If your big sister is listening, what would you like to say to her?<eos> Big sister... please, do the right thing.<eos> Please turn yourself in before anyone else gets hurt.<eos> Sorry.<eos> If you didn't, I would have.

Why?<eos> Because it's not that bad.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> You don't...<eos> I'm sorry, Sun, but you can't understand what it's like to lose everything.
And what do I have?<eos> My parents are dead.<eos> And my only brother will kill me if I don't kill him first.<eos> If anyone should be on the bed crying, it should be me.<eos> But you will never do that.
Lito!<eos> Burt Lancaster had this... power.<eos> Oh, I get that.<eos> They all wanted to be her.<eos> Did you want Burt to kiss and drip on you, too?
What did the transcript say?<eos> It was a call from Khalial, one of my competitors.<eos> He was negotiating a contract on my life.<eos> He was talking to Lila.<eos> You know this city.
You know this world.<eos> I'm not asking for you to get involved.<eos> I just need information.<eos> You were right about the difference between us.<eos> I want to live as you live, without a leash around my neck.
Change?<eos> People like what they're used to.<eos> People also want things to get better.<eos> Someone is listening to all the noise you make.<eos> - You and your lady should be careful.
So, let's say I play along.<eos> Is this where you tell me I have to take out Sebastian Fuchs?<eos> I promised you, no middle ground.<eos> How do I know you won't just sell me out like everyone else?<eos> You're not like everyone else.

I don't give a shit about any of it.<eos> I don't care about rules, about what's right or wrong.<eos> What matters to me is this.<eos> Right now.<eos> And I know you feel the same.
No, no. This isn't really me.<eos> It's Jordi.<eos> Looks good.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You're looking very good, too.
I teach it to my university students back home.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you, that's very kind.<eos> Hernando, Dani, please, don't embarrass the man.<eos> And you are?

I teach it to my university students back home.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you, that's very kind.<eos> Hernando, Dani, please, don't embarrass the man.<eos> And you are?
- What are you doing?<eos> It's a new car!<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> Assistants are stationary.<eos> - And you come and go like a tornado.
They've been waiting for you all day.<eos> - I'm running important research now.<eos> - Can you hear yourself?<eos> We are a family, Wanda.<eos> You are a family.
- and to love only me.<eos> - Thanks a lot.<eos> I wanted... to straighten things out. Somehow...<eos> What about the kids?<eos> You have yours, I have mine.
To have someone who'd love only me.<eos> Besides, the war is long over now.<eos> New times, new life.<eos> Are you happy now?<eos> You came up with this triangle thing.
It's not summer holidays yet.<eos> Let's get on the train to Lodz.<eos> Wanda!<eos> We're doing a bad thing.<eos> You're the smart one.
God knows how long he'll stay in charge.<eos> I'll bear it in mind.<eos> Madame Michalina.<eos> - You're fascinating.<eos> - And you can't dance.
- How do you know?<eos> You don't want to talk about ticks, do you?<eos> The point is...<eos> - he wants to...<eos> - Do you?
- Good.<eos> Come.<eos> A number of conditions must be fulfilled, before we, women, can open up.<eos> The first time is crucial.<eos> He must be gentle, and you must be wet.
You can't stay here, honey!<eos> - Why?<eos> - Aunt Wanda loves you so much<eos> - that she must be going crazy now.<eos> - But you are my mom!
Your bonus.<eos> I was planning to give you two million.<eos> It just went up to five.<eos> I quit, Bobby.<eos> I can't be in denial about what this place is, what you are, any longer.
- The Rosato brothers killed him, and he's saying this is like that.<eos> It is questionable.<eos> Fire systems have automatic cutoffs.<eos> We weren't even allowed in to get our stuff.<eos> I know what you know.
We all get complaints, right?<eos> Struggle for you is you remember the complaints, don't you?<eos> They lodge deep.<eos> They haunt you.<eos> Because you want to believe you're perfect.
Just breathe for me.<eos> Michael, thank you.<eos> Why don't you go walk the perimeter?<eos> Word out of Washington is that Rhoades' misconduct is being investigated.<eos> You somehow put that in motion?
You need two reccos.<eos> I got Michael Che to second you.<eos> Can't have you distracting our staff with this bullshit.<eos> - You're a member?<eos> - So are you now.
It's poison.<eos> And you don't even need to ingest it for it to kill you.<eos> - Proximity is enough.<eos> - Well, good for you.<eos> I no longer have proximity to it, and you no longer have proximity to me.
True master.<eos> Hall of Fame.<eos> Always finished top three.<eos> Oh, but to you, top three is never enough.<eos> You don't show.
Hall of Fame.<eos> Always finished top three.<eos> Oh, but to you, top three is never enough.<eos> You don't show.<eos> You win.
You don't show.<eos> You win.<eos> That I do.<eos> Mine's a different business.<eos> Look, you and the team are right.
It's all right, Melissa.<eos> We understand.<eos> I hope you die and she becomes president.<eos> What did the girl say to you?<eos> She said she hopes I die and that you become the president.
The president is essentially asking for permission - to fight a war on our soil.<eos> - We can't push back too hard.<eos> We can't afford to look soft on terror.<eos> We can't look the other way, either.<eos> You of all people know where this kind of talk leads.
This is a trap.<eos> - Or the only way out.<eos> God damn it.<eos> - You want out?<eos> - Don't you?
But who did she put in? Who did the Speaker put on the committee?<eos> Mostly lifers, with secure seats.<eos> We're two weeks out.<eos> It's hard to say no to war.<eos> You and I have some things in common.
You thought your nightmare was coming true.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Don't get me wrong, it's not like I don't deserve it.<eos> Oh, that's bullshit, man.<eos> You didn't betray anybody.
I respect you. I respect your place.<eos> But you hold your stress in too long, it rots out your insides.<eos> So I am gonna get my payback on that red dot motherfucker.<eos> He can't stay in here forever.<eos> What if you stayed in here forever?
But you hold your stress in too long, it rots out your insides.<eos> So I am gonna get my payback on that red dot motherfucker.<eos> He can't stay in here forever.<eos> What if you stayed in here forever?<eos> What if... you... never left this room?
You've got your bugout bag inside, yeah?<eos> Toss it in my trunk.<eos> I will drive you to the train station right now.<eos> What is there to think about?<eos> You said it yourself, you are blown here.
Like when your ashes need hauling?<eos> Man, she's 75 years old.<eos> She looks in on Hushpuppy when I gotta be out late.<eos> Anyway, she told me about your little rooftop phone call you made yesterday after you Houdini'd out of my zip ties.<eos> She told you, you told Vince.
So... anyway, he puts that gun in my hand.<eos> He takes a look at Terrence on his knees, shaking with fear, swollen face looking up at us, hoping he's not gonna be killed.<eos> And Lonnie comes up to me, and he just whispers in my ear,<eos> "Okay, motherfucker.<eos> "You broke it.

Marius!<eos> Make him stop!<eos> [sobbing] Please, Marius.<eos> - Please, no!<eos> - You broke it.
[sobbing] Please, Marius.<eos> - Please, no!<eos> - You broke it.<eos> - Please make him stop!<eos> - You bought it.
I said I was scared.<eos> And what did I tell you?<eos> Put my head on your chest.<eos> Close my eyes.<eos> That you would be scared for the both of us.
Close.<eos> Crystals, brimstones.<eos> I'm dating this guy who's really obsessed with the whole psychic vibe thing.<eos> Hey, you want a tarot card reading?<eos> Maybe I can tell you how long you an Paul will be together.
I wish I had a key.<eos> Interesting design choice.<eos> Ah... okay.<eos> So...<eos> You're the flower killer.
Holy shit!<eos> Wha... hi.<eos> Look, it's not that I don't appreciate the offer, but... -mm hmm.<eos> I need you inside of me.<eos> Who are you?
You're living in the house, aren't you?<eos> I'm sorry, who are you?<eos> The only survivor.<eos> The accident with the furnace.<eos> You're the girl.
In order to do this, a new breed must be created.<eos> Human on the outside.<eos> Demon within.<eos> You killed Paul, you bastard.<eos> You killed him!
Right.<eos> Right.<eos> Just don't go making something out of nothing, that's all.<eos> - It's what we do, isn't it?<eos> - It's what you do!
Who doesn't?<eos> It's no excuse.<eos> This lands at my door, nobody else's.<eos> You couldn't have known.<eos> You knew.
I am happy for you.<eos> You've been an asshole ever since I told you I was gonna buy my place.<eos> How'd you find the money to buy a place in Santa Monica?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I know what I make. Pretty sure I know what you make.
The sound of you fucking up.<eos> I did the right thing.<eos> Oh, you're so sure about that, huh?<eos> What, your vast PR experience led you to that conclusion?<eos> And you were ready to send that kid to prison for...
Killing someone.<eos> Shall we go over the facts again?<eos> You should start working on your r√©sum√©.<eos> Yeah?<eos> You should... go back to the tight suit store.
I used to be a fireman.<eos> I'm trained in emergency medicine.<eos> No, I need a surgeon, not a fucking fire-tranny.<eos> Hey, I don't care if you bleed out.<eos> I can get back to my magazine, and you can die on the floor and go straight to hell.
He can't die.<eos> Please.<eos> It's not for him.<eos> It's for me.<eos> Did you do this?
You should've shaved it off like we told you.<eos> Bet you're regretting it now.<eos> I'm not a fucking Nazi skinhead.<eos> I'm a white nationalist.<eos> And you're on the fucking ground, too, baldy.
We?<eos> Piss off, Bloody Mary.<eos> I'm not helping you.<eos> I'm making earplugs out of pencil erasers.<eos> You know, Flores is outside with a shiv, and I'm closer to the door than you are.
Hello, Calvin.<eos> How does that feel, Hugh?<eos> You're going to be a daddy.<eos> It's gonna be a big custody battle over this one.<eos> You can, Kazumi.
Almost there. Push!<eos> Any moment now, okay, push<eos> Easy to say.<eos> Easy for you to say.<eos> You can, Kazumi.
Easy to say.<eos> Easy for you to say.<eos> You can, Kazumi.<eos> You can do it, Kazumi.<eos> You can, you can!
Its okay.<eos> Push!<eos> Push.<eos> You'll be able to meet Mei soon.<eos> You can.
I understand that. But risks are taken for a reason.<eos> Because of Calvin, we can learn so much about life.<eos> Its origin, its nature, perhaps even its meaning.<eos> I know.<eos> You're a doctor.
Kat, come on!<eos> Come on!<eos> Just pull down on the lever!<eos> Kat!<eos> Come on, You can do this!
Exactly.<eos> Without life support, there is no life.<eos> Right.<eos> Ok, Hugh and I will sweep from quest east<eos> And... You and Sho scan the poles and lock off each compartment
And I hold it long enough, It will avoid re-entry.<eos> We fly it into deep space.<eos> With.. With Calvin.<eos> Yes.<eos> Meanwhile, you get into the boat B. You press the button.
And this has been your plan from all along.<eos> So make sure that creature doesn't get to Earth.<eos> - Then I should be Plan A.<eos> - No, I'm the pilot.<eos> You're the Plan B.
What do you want me to do?<eos> I'm not God.<eos> Zelda, let's go.<eos> How could you leave that animal to suffer like that?<eos> You're the one that hit it, Zelda.
He came out of nowhere.<eos> No one could have stopped.<eos> I never should have let you drive.<eos> Let me drive?<eos> You insisted.
Don't know what you're trying to say, fancy pants.<eos> What clothing should my wife be wearing?<eos> Scott, let's just go.<eos> No.<eos> I am tired and hungry, you would like to take a bath, and we would like to get a room.
Everything's come undone.<eos> Nothing's come undone.<eos> We're fine.<eos> We're not fine.<eos> We have no money, no car, no place to stay, no place for you to write.
You go.<eos> Liam was asking for help from the werecoyote,<eos> - not the banshee.<eos> - Why me?<eos> Because you're the former animal.
Liam was asking for help from the werecoyote,<eos> - not the banshee.<eos> - Why me?<eos> Because you're the former animal.<eos> Nobody understands mysterious animal situations like you do.
- Mom. - Mmm-mmm.<eos> You know stuff.<eos> That means you have to do stuff.<eos> I have an obligation to educate, not eliminate all the problems of Beacon Hills.<eos> I have to run a school, and you have to go enroll in one.
No.<eos> Out.<eos> Okay.<eos> All right.<eos> - You started it.
We learned that from the Nemeton.<eos> What kind of price?<eos> A big price?<eos> Big.<eos> You let it out.
then I'll head to the castle.<eos> Everything's under control.<eos> Alice.<eos> Apology accepted.<eos> That was you apologizing for what you did.
It's what makes you feel the pain will burn you till there's nothing.<eos> And, yes, it's also there for love, but, uh, let's be frank, darling, you're more likely to throw yourself off a bridge than ever love again.<eos> I felt that way.<eos> And I knew it crippled me when I needed to be strong.<eos> As you do now.
- Sounds a little far-fetched.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - Really, really?<eos> - Not that far.<eos> -To be honest with you, he doesn't seem like the murderer type, you know.
-Uh...<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I did.<eos> I love black birds.<eos> -Yeah, and you are?
Five years later, he's out on the fucking street.<eos> But a black kid at the park gets a life sentence for slinging a dime bag.<eos> Pretty fucked up.<eos> - Well, he's black.<eos> You said it.
- I got it.<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> Um, and I mean every word I say, okay?<eos> No sudden moves, or...<eos> You know, with this guy, you might get yourself killed.
So, what do you think?<eos> - Well, I think we need to find the two Mexican guys and this mysterious Luke.<eos> -Oh, yeah.<eos> - Like I said, i ain't going nowhere.<eos> And if I get arrested, you're gonna be my lawyer.
- Shut the fuck up!<eos> - Fucking slut.<eos> - Hey, white girl.<eos> - No!<eos> -And now you're next.
- Abda, with me.<eos> - Yes, ma'am.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Let's both calm down, I'm not upset.<eos> Yeah, but I say no to buying him a cell phone until he's 12 and you go and buy him one.
What a shitty landing zone!<eos> It's not so hard, damn it!<eos> We could have all been killed!<eos> Is everyone okay?<eos> Who are you?
Or we could just leave with what we came for!<eos> Afraid we can't let you do that.<eos> Face it.<eos> You'll never lay an oversized green finger on me.<eos> Well, you'll never lay a puny green finger on me!
I could have arrested your brother in Pune for Wasim's murder.<eos> But I didn't.<eos> - Why?<eos> Because I show my cards only when I have three aces.<eos> Neither you, nor this city will burn.
Sure, why not?<eos> Thanks for asking.<eos> I'm Marteen McGuire.<eos> Friends call me Teena.<eos> Now you say your name.
- Yeah?<eos> - Promise?<eos> - You promise, huh?<eos> How's mamma?<eos> She's fine, because you and I are gonna stick together.
One to seven.<eos> One on this side.<eos> Seven on the end.<eos> There's nothing to be afraid of, sweetie.<eos> Hey, Bethie, you're gonna pick them out and I'm gonna put him away for a very long time.
Ignore him.<eos> Watch and learn.<eos> All those lies about my brothers...<eos> Bitch better watch her mouth.<eos> You and your whore mamma better shut your faces.
Friday morning is the first step, in a series of steps to make sure that men like that, never do this to anyone ever again.<eos> Hey. I'll see you in Court.<eos> Detective Dromoor...<eos> [INDISTINCTIVE]<eos> You point them out, I'll put them away.
We both know what it's like to lose someone we love.<eos> Don't let her lose her mother too.<eos> Don't let her feel any more pain.<eos> Why do you care?<eos> Because you found me?
Everything good on the phone?<eos> We'd better be going, baby.<eos> Oh.<eos> You remember the pie?<eos> You remember the pie.
We're meeting an investigator?<eos> Legal investigator.<eos> Works for Kirkpatrick.<eos> I don't get why we're going to meet him, though.<eos> You don't get shit.
There he is.<eos> He's gone.<eos> So, now what?<eos> He gets out?<eos> No, now you get out.
So, now what?<eos> He gets out?<eos> No, now you get out.<eos> - I get out?<eos> - You get the stuff.
Heading to the mall.<eos> Anyone wanna join me for a bit of shopping?<eos> I do!<eos> Can we get some food along the way?<eos> Only if you're driving.
We both seem nice and normal, right?<eos> Uh, well, you know, I seem normal.<eos> I know that much. - But... - Grazie.<eos> I won't even look at you. It will be like we're eating alone.<eos> Well, if you get weird...
Really? Do you think my belly has gotten bigger?<eos> Of course.<eos> You eat everything!<eos> Pizza, pasta, gelato, cheese...<eos> So do you!
I was breastfed for two years.<eos> Great, it seems like it worked out<eos> - super great for you.<eos> - It did.<eos> ‚ô™ You've got a fast car ‚ô™
‚ô™ Me, myself, I got nothing to prove... ‚ô™<eos> I'd love it if you'd stop singing, and so would Grover.<eos> He doesn't like it.<eos> I feel like you're both kidding, so I'm gonna keep going.<eos> ‚ô™ You've got a fast car ‚ô™
Okay, I'm sorry we didn't make any jam.<eos> I'm sorry you didn't meet, like, a hot woodworker.<eos> But this is reality.<eos> It's happening now.<eos> And you suck at it, okay?
I'm sorry you didn't meet, like, a hot woodworker.<eos> But this is reality.<eos> It's happening now.<eos> And you suck at it, okay?<eos> You're doing a bad job, and the reason you are is 'cause you're the immature one, so check that out!
All these cunts in linen pants who were so pleased not to be using formula.<eos> I mean, I was raised on formula.<eos> Nice post-war formula.<eos> What's the fucking problem?<eos> You turned out fine.
Why are you judging me?<eos> Because you just said your baby hates you, and that is the most moronic thing I have ever heard.<eos> He doesn't hate you.<eos> He doesn't hate anybody.<eos> He's a goddamn baby, and you are all he has.
Men are disgusting.<eos> - Am I English?<eos> No?<eos> - No, just me.<eos> You're a pilot.
Guys, I got it.<eos> I got it.<eos> Good.<eos> That's good, Grover.<eos> ‚ô™ You had a fast car ‚ô™
No, no, no.<eos> I'm worse than my father.<eos> - I'm a fucking monster.<eos> - Hey... if you don't believe in your own goodness, you can't expect anybody else to, you know?<eos> Do you?
- The whole thing is just so intense.<eos> - For who?<eos> By the way, me telling you this does not make me a bad secret-keeper.<eos> Okay?<eos> You and I have a sacred bond, like that of husband and wife, where you can say anything in a sacred space.
Where the fuck do you even get a car like this?<eos> I know, right?<eos> My boy Alessio restores 'em.<eos> Of course you have a boy named Alessio.<eos> Desi: You know Alessio.
Jesus!<eos> Yeah, I am sick!<eos> I'm fucked up!<eos> I'm fucking sick!<eos> But you're fucking demented.
I don't think you should say "jaunt." That's not a good expression to use.<eos> No, I mean, like, how the fuck did I end up here?<eos> I'm on a trip with my ex-husband, who I didn't know was a drug addict, which is the second time that's happened to me, by the way.<eos> You are so bad at knowing when people are high.<eos> Do you remember that time I drank sizzurp and you thought I had senioritis?
- Yeah?<eos> Do you promise that we'll always be friends?<eos> You think I'm gonna stop being your friend now?<eos> After putting up with all this bullshit?<eos> You've put up with a lot of bullshit, too.
Yeah, get out of her face!<eos> Grow up!<eos> Grow up!<eos> Now I have nothing!<eos> Who the fuck are you to say "grow up"?
Well, I wasn't gonna not show.<eos> I was just surprised.<eos> Surprised, what, that I wanted to talk?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I just... surprised that you... found the article that I wrote.
Remember what happened in Salem.<eos> Yeah, these four women are the witches.<eos> - I'm the witch.<eos> - I don't see it that way.<eos> These women don't have the reach that you have.
This isn't the Civil Rights Movement, Hannah.<eos> It's me.<eos> It's just me getting head in some sterile hotel room in Rhode Island.<eos> So, the larger significance is just lost on you?<eos> You just don't even...
- Oh, my God.<eos> You know what?<eos> I haven't been offered a beverage, so I think I'm gonna get myself one.<eos> The part where she looks like a Victoria's Secret model and I didn't lose my virginity until I was 25 and I was on Accutane... that part's not lost on me.<eos> I'm talking about the part where you're a very fucking famous writer and she's working really hard to have just a little bit of what you get every day.
It's not so she has a story.<eos> It's so she feels like she exists.<eos> And, by the way, people don't talk about this shit for fun.<eos> It ruins their lives.<eos> You know that.
I mean, it's spoiled with Denise.<eos> I...<eos> I know it is, but I can ask you where you're from, what you want, who you are.<eos> I can...<eos> I can show you you're more to me than just a pretty face.
Woman: Guys, someone call 911!<eos> Bobby?<eos> Bobby?<eos> and, Desi, it is my personal opinion that we really need to get back to work.<eos> More specifically, you need to get back to work.
- Okay.<eos> - All right.<eos> It's not an insult.<eos> Nobody's blaming you.<eos> Desi just feels as if maybe you have helped to support,
Nobody's blaming you.<eos> Desi just feels as if maybe you have helped to support,<eos> - even encourage his relapse.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Again, I'm not quite sure how that isn't blaming me, but we can discuss... you and I can discuss that later.
- Because...<eos> - It's okay, it's okay.<eos> We're going to let Desi finish, and when he's done, you can then let us know how you feel.<eos> I promise you I'll give you tons of time.<eos> Okay, you finish now, and then I'll have my time to talk.
I know.<eos> Do you get to keep those jeans, though?<eos> I-I'm sorry?<eos> You don't know.<eos> You can do your job without a whole crew of assholes in your face.
Then you quietly retreated back to dating girls with six packs and pretending death wasn't real.<eos> I'm worried about you, Ray.<eos> You're smart.<eos> You've always been smart, but your priorities are... cuckoo bananas.<eos> And what, you're some fucking golden example?
Welcome to Alterplex.<eos> Can't stay here.<eos> We should keep moving.<eos> Look at what they've done.<eos> - And what about what you did, Michael?
This energy is then transferred cleanly and safely into our world powering it for millennia to come.<eos> I had the exact same face.<eos> - Parallel universes?<eos> - An echo universe.<eos> And this here is where you come in.
No, just these vehicles went missing.<eos> - That's why Alterplex sent me.<eos> - So it's not...<eos> - I'm not...<eos> - Like I said, as far as I know the other you is alive.
Let me go talk to him, okay?<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Where am I?<eos> - How long have I been out?<eos> - Who are you?
we don't have a lot of time.<eos> What...<eos> - Hey!<eos> - Easy!<eos> Who are you?
Redivider...<eos> What is Redivider?<eos> What is it?<eos> You sent me here.<eos> You... sent me here.
What is Redivider?<eos> What is it?<eos> You sent me here.<eos> You... sent me here.<eos> Now you tell me what is Redivider.
Yeah.<eos> I've been so selfish.<eos> - We're gonna get through this.<eos> - I don't wanna just get through this, Mia.<eos> You and Donny deserve way better.
- You okay?<eos> - Oh, shit, I'm hit!<eos> I'm hit!<eos> Stop the car!<eos> Here, you take the wheel.
We never hang out.<eos> We never do anything.<eos> We see each other all the time, Ray.<eos> Yeah, after you've exercised or when your online therapist's husband is awake so she can give you a session.<eos> I mean, don't you... isn't...
The scene is about the fact that these two people, while they have a very strong animalistic connection, they're ultimately only gonna hurt each other.<eos> It's about the tragedy of realizing the relationship is too intense to survive.<eos> Adam, that's us.<eos> We're the intense ones.<eos> All you and Hannah ever did was sit around, watching those shows about when fat people do up their houses or whatever, or you ate Frito-Lays in bed.
You said one day you wanted to be a mother.<eos> We got a really special, specific thing going on, you and me, yeah?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Yeah!<eos> And you just decided to go and ruin it with some baby.
You've said so many mean things to me and I can't make one stupid salvia joke?<eos> Elijah, come on!<eos> I don't know, I kind of thought you'd be happy.<eos> You're not ready for this.<eos> No, you're not ready for this.
- Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Are you serious?<eos> - Yeah. You're old enough, so, yeah.<eos> And, you know, on the spectrum of human beings, you basically have your shit together.
- Oh, Jesus.<eos> - No more bullshit gigs!<eos> I'm tired of being exploited.<eos> Exploited?<eos> Rehab let me know that you exploit me.
Oh, money. Money!<eos> Yes, the fucking money!<eos> Oh, the money! Oh!<eos> Fuck money!<eos> Do you honestly think that I'm, like, dying to perform at some shitty club in New Jersey called "La Vue"?
And I have an audition at 9:00 in the morning.<eos> Actually, since we're stuck here, would you run lines with me?<eos> Just once through to make sure I know it.<eos> Fine.<eos> You're Dustin because I'm Lavinia, obviously.
In fact, maybe not ever. I don't think we ever acted like real friends.<eos> Seriously, Hannah?<eos> You can't just detach yourself from a relationship.<eos> Unless you're some kind of... psychopath.<eos> Well, maybe you're a psychopath for just coming over here.
So I'm just gonna leave here and then you and I are gonna figure out some way that we don't ever see each other again. That's the plan, huh?<eos> So, bye.<eos> Bye.<eos> And for the record, I am a sociopath.<eos> But you are a fucking psychopath. And it's so much worse.
Mom.<eos> Adios, Marn.<eos> Elijah: I mean, even if you're amazing at something, that doesn't necessarily mean that you should do it, right?<eos> And if I'm saying that I'm a Broadway-caliber actor, shouldn't I only be auditioning for things that would take place on Broadway?<eos> I mean, the only reason I would actually do it is because it would be, like, a favor to Padgett, because Padgett was like, "Oh, Elijah, you reinvented the form.
Adam: I break things, Mira.<eos> That's what I do.<eos> It's why I avoided you for so long, 'cause I didn't wanna break you.<eos> But this, now... so perfect, it scares me a little.<eos> The only time I've ever felt perfect is when I'm with you, and you're telling me I'm perfect.
I can do this.<eos> Because you know why, Athena Dante?<eos> I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.<eos> I'm really, really fucking talented.<eos> I'm as talented as you say you are.
I just want to buy the full package of elite channels so that I can enjoy a range of programs. Do you understand?<eos> Can you hold on a second?<eos> Just...<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> Mm-hmm. - Yeah, I'm okay. Are you okay?
- What the fuck, Laird?<eos> No. - I realized why I'm here.<eos> The purpose of my life was to become a junkie so I could better, so I could move into this building, so I can meet you, and we have that moment, and we establish that base.<eos> And we go away from that, which is fine, 'cause then I met Caroline.<eos> We had a baby, she went away and ruined everything and destroyed my life to give me the clarity of this moment, which is you're having a baby, you're about to be a single parent.
- Okay, wrong example since you lost your virginity at 13 to, like, a lifeguard or something.<eos> You know when you're a little kid and you're not ready to have a sleepover?<eos> - Yes!<eos> - Yes!<eos> And it's, like, kindergarten or first grade and sleepovers are, like, all the rage and everyone's doing it every Friday and Saturday night, and you're just like, "No, I can't.
I need to be with my mom, I need to have my own sheets, I need to have my own toilet.<eos> I can't."<eos> - Yes. - And then one day, someone asks you.<eos> They're like, "Would you like to sleep over on Friday?"<eos> And you're like...
Fucking shit!<eos> - What? - You shouldn't have that!<eos> It's full of green dye and sugar syrup and shit baby's shouldn't have!<eos> Fuck!<eos> You bought it for me!
I was just, like, realizing that I haven't had anyone to talk about this stuff with, so, I'm just kind of, like, processing all the stuff that we'll need for the house.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Yeah. I'm excited.<eos> I'm just excited to get out of my own fucking head for a while, you know?<eos> Aren't you?
- Oh, about almost 90 years.<eos> - That's amazing.<eos> What was a typical Friday night in Brooklyn?<eos> Was there ever a boy who managed to come between your beautiful friendship?<eos> I got him. You don't know that, but I got him,
I've been on this list for artist housing for, like, forever.<eos> They tend to favor married couples, though, so it might help if we did that.<eos> Yeah, and I guess it's time to finally join a food co-op.<eos> It's, like, I don't know, I've never wanted to 'cause I find the whole shift thing kind of demeaning, but...<eos> Well, I can do them all if you handle the bills and stuff like that.
Yeah.<eos> - You were good today.<eos> Yes!<eos> - Me?<eos> Are you crazy?
- Me?<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> It was all you! You got complete strangers to open up.<eos> - It was unbelievable.<eos> - It was teamwork. Well, you led the charge, I just followed.
You proposed on St. Mark's Place, but then you admitted you had chlamydia, and you were crying, and you wouldn't say where it came from.<eos> You said it was a - McDonald's bathroom. - Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga.<eos> The details are not important.<eos> What's important is we agreed to... to live here and suffer and be miserable in this godforsaken rat hole together.<eos> Like, that's a contract you and me made.
I had to unfollow her on Instagram.<eos> It's too much negativity.<eos> I think it's wonderful.<eos> I think it's just what you need.<eos> We'll come visit you on the weekends and you can stay with us whenever you have work to do.
Okay, so we need one for wealth, one for romance, and also one to promote, like, an ease of creativity.<eos> Mm, yeah.<eos> Like a candle's gonna help us find an apartment<eos> - that doesn't smell like hot wings.<eos> - I literally don't care if it smells like hot wings as long as you're there.
Uh, yeah, actually, you kind of did.<eos> You had a party and you didn't invite me?<eos> I mean, this place is, like, at capacity.<eos> Yeah, I did.<eos> Which would be strange, except you're having a baby and you neglected to tell me after you literally told everyone else on the face of the earth.
I need the room.<eos> - Great, 'cause this place smells like pussy cream and I wish I was dead.<eos> Eight million people in this city, and she thinks all the shit's supposed to be from dogs?<eos> I mean, of course people shit in the street.<eos> - You've shit in the street, right?
I think that these people that supposedly know you don't know you at all.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> Yes.<eos> I look at the bluebloods trying to impress you with their cars and their legacies. But they don't have the faintest idea of who you really are.<eos> And you're different?
Keep your voice down.<eos> My daddy would have you strung up and horsewhipped if he found you up here.<eos> It would be worth it.<eos> Is this any good?<eos> I don't know. You tell me.
Think of the lives these people had, the loves they shared.<eos> How could any of it be in vain when it's all so miraculous?<eos> Oh, in the end, I guess we're just humans, drunk on the idea that love can fix everything.<eos> Because it can.<eos> You are the finest, loveliest, most glorious person I've ever met.
No, without you I'm nothing.<eos> I'm less than nothing.<eos> Is that really what you want me to think?<eos> Because that's not the man I thought you were.<eos> You're not a quitter.
Would it shock you to know that I'm not Norman?<eos> That he isn't here and that you can't touch him?<eos> Spare me your bullshit.<eos> Get out of the car.<eos> You're above it all, are you?
Are you with Romero?<eos> Romero?<eos> No, I-I don't know a Romero.<eos> Okay.<eos> All right, well... you just... just hang tight, okay?
But as you can see, I'm quite all right.<eos> You are, huh?<eos> You know something?<eos> Don't think I am unsympathetic to your plight.<eos> I know what it's like to be locked up somewhere and being watched all the time, because you put me in such a place... do you remember?
Yeah.<eos> I've gotten to know this nice girl, Joanne.<eos> She's helping me with my store Website.<eos> She's single and says she never meets anyone.<eos> She's really cute and nice, and you're really cute and nice.
My husband doesn't know many people here, and I'm trying to get him to see how cool this place is and, you know, meet the locals.<eos> I thought it would be a win-win.<eos> And a chance for us to get to know each other better, too.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Well, I think if you're going, then it's different.
Fastest-moving creature on record.<eos> Still pretty rare, though.<eos> She's stunning.<eos> So here's what I'm thinking.<eos> I bring you these, uh, specimens... And you, uh, turn 'em into art.
You're artistic.<eos> Oh, I know she is, just from being in her shop.<eos> Uh... our shop.<eos> Yes, of course, Sam.<eos> It's just, you're never there.
Love is not an easy thing.<eos> This much I know.<eos> You are a river of fire.<eos> I do not know how to swim.<eos> You do not know how to drown.
How much longer?<eos> We need a book You need a book.<eos> Your goldfish needs a book.<eos> Stop eating ketchup and bread all day!<eos> You smoke non-stop.
Uncool, unmarried.<eos> For life.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I will marry you.<eos> But you need to improve your figure first.
Mumbai!<eos> - What are you saying?<eos> - Yeah, it's been two months.<eos> I'm still trying my luck at singing.<eos> And you must be researching something boring at your bank.
And sent me a stupid SMS.<eos> I really liked this one.<eos> The idiot dumped me.<eos> Why do these guys agree to marry you?<eos> They should know your track record You're the runner.
What is it?<eos> Clean that corner.<eos> Pick up all those bottles.<eos> Go back to sleep, moron.<eos> Who the hell are you?
What are you scared of?<eos> Listen sometime, your heart says things.<eos> Listen sometime, your heart says things.<eos> Can't you hear the sky is calling you.<eos> All the things you want to forget that cause pain.
- I will fix this, I promise.<eos> How?<eos> We can't go to the police.<eos> They'll never believe us.<eos> The paper said that you were the third victim.
There's no one else here.<eos> I came completely alone.<eos> Well, then you're the fool.<eos> Perhaps I am.<eos> But I am also in possession of the one thing that you want.
I am you.<eos> I'd like to feel what you feel... think what you think.
- ... I dreamed I was inside you.<eos> - When I want to stop being me...<eos> - I could feel inside you.<eos> - So I can be you.<eos> You are me.
No!<eos> Don't open it.<eos> Are you sure you want to do it?<eos> Yes.<eos> Aren't you?
Yes.<eos> Aren't you?<eos> I'm surprised.<eos> I didn't think you were serious.<eos> You said it too.
- Are you sure?<eos> - Why, what was it?<eos> Drugs?<eos> Hey, I didn't look!<eos> Before you took it, was anyone else looking at it?
A pleasure.<eos> - I'm Carlos.<eos> - Here, for you, for the new house.<eos> - Liliums, my favorite.<eos> You know how to win over the mother-in-law.
But, Laura, your father will kill you.<eos> - They're divorced, he doesn't care.<eos> She'll be annoyed, but she had me at 17.<eos> You'll be cleaning up baby shit and missing college.<eos> Do you want to spend another four years studying?
- We're not talking about that.<eos> What would you have done?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm 18 and you're 17.
Yes.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm sorry that you're worried.<eos> I'd like to be able to love the way you can.
I've got a couple. Erase that photo!<eos> What was that?<eos> - Show me the photo.<eos> - All right.<eos> You barely inhaled. Take a drag.
What was that?<eos> - Show me the photo.<eos> - All right.<eos> You barely inhaled. Take a drag.<eos> - You go all out!
- I don't know.<eos> - I'd like you to explain.<eos> - What's wrong? You don't want a boyfriend who just repairs watches?<eos> Look, you can repair watches or do whatever you want.<eos> But you've got a lot of talent.
To work?<eos> I need you to do me a favor.<eos> Pablo found... part of a wrapper from a condom<eos> in our bedroom.<eos> If he asks me again, I'm going to tell him that I've spoken to you and that you and Carlos used the bedroom when we weren't here.
Some very cool people are bisexual, like Lady Gaga or Angelina Jolie.<eos> What are you trying to say?<eos> There are people who think that what we did on my birthday...<eos> I don't know.<eos> You should know.
Come on, we'll stay a while and then we'll leave.<eos> What people?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Before you said, "There are people who think..."<eos> Did you tell anyone?
I'd like you to be happy.<eos> I'm happy with you.<eos> We need time.<eos> I don't know who I am.<eos> Or who you are.
One of the disadvantages of being a girl.<eos> - I'll see you later.<eos> - Hey... which painters do you like?<eos> Why?<eos> You paint, don't you?
Please.<eos> Seriously.<eos> - Alex, can you take him home?<eos> - Have you got a helmet?<eos> - Alex, are you fit to drive?
I thought she was with you.<eos> No, she's with another guy.<eos> I understand.<eos> I want to go away with her for a few days.<eos> - You love her very much, don't you?
- You love her very much, don't you?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I think we just need some time. - If we're alone, we can sort it out.<eos> - What you need is to give each other space.<eos> Laura is too young for such a serious relationship, and so are you.
I've spoken to your father so that you can stay if you want.<eos> We'll find a college dorm.<eos> Do you remember when I was seven?<eos> I was very sick, I had a fever.<eos> Dad had just left and you were very angry.
I was very sick, I had a fever.<eos> Dad had just left and you were very angry.<eos> You told me that I should never marry until I was economically independent.<eos> I don't know if it was because of the fever but I was really scared,<eos> and I told you that I couldn't live if you died.
Do you remember?<eos> I don't know why on earth I said<eos> "economically independent" to a child of seven.<eos> He hasn't come out for three weeks.<eos> Maybe you can persuade him.
- Are you sure?<eos> Will you give me a kiss at least?<eos> I'm on the pill.<eos> I don't want to catch anything.<eos> You're not like this.
I'm sorry.<eos> I am you.<eos> I am you.<eos> I am you.<eos> I'd like to feel what you feel, think what you think.
I am you.<eos> I'd like to feel what you feel, think what you think.<eos> I am you.<eos> I am you.<eos> - You are me.
- ...so I can be you.<eos> - Recently...<eos> Nothing about you disgusts me.<eos> I want to suck every part of your body.<eos> I'd like to feel what you feel...
- Recently...<eos> Nothing about you disgusts me.<eos> I want to suck every part of your body.<eos> I'd like to feel what you feel...<eos> - I'd like to... - Think what you think.
Nothing about you disgusts me.<eos> I want to suck every part of your body.<eos> I'd like to feel what you feel...<eos> - I'd like to... - Think what you think.<eos> I'd like to feel what you feel, think what you think.
- Recently... - There are moments... - ...<eos> I dreamed I was inside you. - When I want to stop being me...<eos> - I could feel inside you.<eos> - So I can be you.<eos> You are me. I am you.
Just stay in bed.<eos> You know, we don't have to be anywhere today, so I'll bring up some food in a little bit, and everything's gonna be fine.<eos> Oh, by the way, stay out of the basement.<eos> Why shouldn't I go in the basement?<eos> Because I've been organizing down there and you're gonna start pushing things around and then I'm gonna get annoyed.
I could watch over things during blackouts.<eos> It's easier with two.<eos> I can't pay you anything.<eos> We have no extra money.<eos> I mean, there'd be no salary, so what would you be getting out of it?
Norman, I want to talk to you!<eos> Caleb is in the basement?<eos> Why?<eos> He came here two nights ago.<eos> He thinks that Norma's dead, and he thinks that you killed her.
It would never work, Caleb.<eos> Why not?<eos> Because you're both in love with me.<eos> He's your son.<eos> And you're my brother.
And you're my brother.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I don't want to hurt you.<eos> Even though you hurt me.
Sorry, Davis.<eos> You're a liability now.<eos> You'll understand.<eos> Who are you?<eos> John Doe. Who are you?
We're lucky.<eos> I got two bottles of sunblock with my last paycheck.<eos> Sunblock?<eos> Like I'm all fancy and stuff.<eos> We're out here in the middle of the motherfucking Death Race, and you're talking to me about sunblock?
Just get in the car.<eos> They snuck up on me.<eos> Who were those guys?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You tell me.
I knew the very first moment that I saw you.<eos> Then why didn't you turn me in?<eos> Because I thought this might be interesting and I don't give a shit about politics.<eos> Of course, because all you care about is the fucking race!<eos> Millions of people stuck in their miserable lives, but none of that matters as long as you win!
But they threatened to kill my daughter!<eos> My daughter, Bryan!<eos> Lianne!<eos> You really want to know when my cover was blown?<eos> When you and the Colombians screwed the pooch on that raid.
Got it.<eos> Just have him call me when he lands.<eos> Eyes and ears on the lawyer.<eos> Reroute all calls.<eos> You killed my son.
Just have him call me when he lands.<eos> Eyes and ears on the lawyer.<eos> Reroute all calls.<eos> You killed my son.<eos> And you killed my sister.
Oh... that.<eos> I forgot you haven't come to see me in some time.<eos> Zack.<eos> I want to help.<eos> You and I can figure this out together.
Let's take this hound for a walk.<eos> Okay, so Dr. Brennan was in here, examining the remains when Zack took her.<eos> All right then.<eos> Let's see what we can smell.<eos> Or... you know what I mean.
But I believe, when dealing with accusations of serial murder, it is best to meet face to face.<eos> Look, ask him how he even knows about the killer.<eos> There's nothing in the press.<eos> Zack, why don't you help me out here.<eos> If you're not responsible, as you say, then how do you even know about this supposed killer?
Unbelievable. So he had access to all my e-mails?<eos> Yep.<eos> I have to say though, he did show some sense of discretion.<eos> He didn't open any of the photo attachments between Hodgins and me.<eos> Not that you and Arastoo do that. Or... do you?
Dr. Faulk?<eos> Hello?<eos> Booth... Hmm?<eos> I don't think he's here.<eos> You think?
Sorry.<eos> Um, what about blackouts?<eos> Have you had any in the last year?<eos> Zack.<eos> If you and I are going to continue, you have to answer that.
Oh, you think you're pretty good, do you?<eos> I am deadly accurate in everything I do.<eos> Old Mr. Chads here. The meanest teacher I ever had. - Oh, he was harmless.<eos> - Mm-mm.<eos> Easy for you to say, he liked you.
Well, he cares about you a great deal. Anyone can see that and...<eos> You know, he'll certainly be able to care for you.<eos> Those are not unimportant things.<eos> I know that.<eos> You and Daddy never think I do, but I do.
Right.<eos> He fell.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> This is... this is my career, okay?<eos> You are... you are just toxic, and I'm honestly not surprised that this happened while you were here.
Okay.<eos> Okay, guys, calm down.<eos> I think the best thing is just to have a little space right now...<eos> Oh, so you know what's best for us?<eos> You don't know shit about us.
Uh, that's a common thing.<eos> You know, I let him have his fun.<eos> I see chicks text you pics of their tits and their asses on your phone.<eos> It's still not enough for him.<eos> What about this "arrangement" you guys have where you're fuckin' other dudes?
I don't know what else to say.<eos> Lilly's good to me and, uh, I'm an asshole.<eos> It's all good, man.<eos> I've seen it all.<eos> Right. 'Cause you're the sex-in-the-parking-lot girl.
I'm sorry... but I'm involved with somebody right now.<eos> - Wait! - I...<eos> I can't be...<eos> So it's like that?<eos> You and Heidi are exclusive now or something?
And I'll Uber.<eos> See you at work!<eos> Good night!<eos> ‚ô™ The angels were weeping ‚ô™<eos> ‚ô™ While you were sleeping ‚ô™

Thank you.<eos> I wasn't sure where I left it.<eos> It's been quite an exhausting day.<eos> Mmm, yes, I bet.<eos> You find the Commissioner can be a bit exhausting, too?
So, Cody, why don't you fill us in on what you've done the last few years?<eos> First, I have a question for you.<eos> I, uh...<eos> Okay, go ahead.<eos> Have you or someone you care about expressed the urge to ride waves like a pro?
Yeah, it sounds pretty rad.<eos> Oh, it is, bro.<eos> And I owe it all to you.<eos> If you hadn't saved my life and let me win the Big Z Memorial I'd never be where I am today.<eos> Heck, you'd probably be the one with all the sponsors and endorsements.
Really? What?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> This is what I've always wanted.<eos> To be remembered as a legend, somebody respected.<eos> You know, like a real winner.
Oh, not according to Mr. McMahon and Hunter.<eos> You better start packing your bags, Tank.<eos> Because tomorrow, I'm gonna be part of the Hang 5.<eos> Traveling the world, doing the most radical stuff.<eos> And you'll just go back to being a nobody from nowhere island. And you'll never see me again.
Don't.<eos> - Don't, don't, don't.<eos> - Fuck! Gus, what the fuck?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry. I just didn't want you to...
Definitely back off, 'cause its, like, teeth could rip at your flesh.<eos> Oh, no, no.<eos> He's one of the good ones.<eos> Aren't you, buddy?<eos> You and I aren't that different.
- Fuck! Shit.<eos> - Randy.<eos> Randy, seriously, stop.<eos> Listen to me, I am your guide.<eos> You're not my guide.
I forget.<eos> I'm just saying, like... if I saw, like, an old movie and your face was in it, like, even if you were, like, in a crowd, like, way back in the background,<eos> "Oh, my God.<eos> She's so beautiful."<eos> - Well, I think you're beautiful. - Oh...
- Yeah, sure.<eos> What?<eos> - You don't wanna take that off, do you?<eos> - Fuck, no.<eos> - All right. Do you.
Yeah, better than most people.<eos> AMI, please tell us what you observe.<eos> Dr. Brennan appears 78% curious and 22% jealous.<eos> Agent Booth is 94% amused and six percent skeptical.<eos> And you, Kate, are 100% nervous.
Oh, well, of course I am.<eos> I'm being questioned by the FBI.<eos> Thank you, AMI.<eos> Your work here is done.<eos> So, um, you and Ian didn't have any bad blood, did you?
We all could have been more in touch with him.<eos> He's the reason that we're all home.<eos> At least for me, I'm grateful.<eos> For what?<eos> You moved on, started a family.
Got all this.<eos> You're an addict, just like Aldo.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Unlike him, you got help.<eos> Yeah. But you're in my corner.
No plate numbers, no physical characteristics.<eos> But he did say that it was clean, precise, perfectly executed.<eos> Perhaps someone else with military training.<eos> Well, which means it's possible one of the other men in his unit is responsible.<eos> You think?
Yeah, we read it.<eos> Your close friend was tortured with rats.<eos> That is something we need to discuss.<eos> Look, what do you say?<eos> I was hoping you would have the words.
The X-rays show pronounced bone loss on both femurs.<eos> Almost certainly due to Vitamin D deficiency.<eos> Chances are, she didn't get much sunlight.<eos> And what are you finding?<eos> That you think it's appropriate to share personal details about me with everyone here.
And what are you finding?<eos> That you think it's appropriate to share personal details about me with everyone here.<eos> You have nothing to be ashamed of.<eos> You like to shop on TV.<eos> And you enjoyed telling everyone about it.
Well, they're-they're with an FBI agent.<eos> That is not enough for me.<eos> We're sending them to a safe house.<eos> I want you there.<eos> How am I gonna know if you're okay?
He can't take that on.<eos> Reiss didn't have a chance.<eos> Good luck telling him that.<eos> Look, there's got to be something more that we can bring Kovac in on.<eos> You and I both know that he's behind this.
- The general's blood splattered all over<eos> - You can stop.<eos> the boy who was celebrating....<eos> You can stop!<eos> That must've been a nightmare for you, 'cause you love your dad.
You can stop!<eos> That must've been a nightmare for you, 'cause you love your dad.<eos> My father was a monster.<eos> Yeah, but he was still your dad, right?<eos> Who are you?
Your mom and Russ were with us.<eos> The leaves were turning, changing.<eos> And it started to drizzle.<eos> It was so quiet you could hear the raindrops falling on the windshield.<eos> And you were in the back, doing that thing you do with my ear.
You've been up working all night on Zack's case, haven't you?<eos> Well, yeah.<eos> What choice do I have?<eos> His hearing is in two weeks.<eos> You and Cam threw out the only evidence we have that would exonerate him.
Yeah, sorry about that.<eos> Booth had to go to the chiropractor to get his back checked out. I guess I accidentally double-booked.<eos> That's the victim's mother in there.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Dr. Wyatt has come all this way to assist us, and you and Booth couldn't find a space for him to work? It was a mistake.
- Can my sister and I get a selfie? - Sure.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> Howdy, look at what we got here.<eos> Well, you must be Filthy Rich.
On the day of the robbery, you handed over the $40,000, but you pocketed $20,000 for yourself.<eos> It was a victimless crime-- the bank is insured in case they're robbed.<eos> Yeah, but the only problem is the bank manager went on TV and said exactly how much was taken.<eos> Dustin must have figured out what you did.<eos> So after he got beaten up by his accomplices, he came back to confront you-- that's when the two of you struggled and you shot him.
Not stopping the woman I love from making the biggest mistake of her life.<eos> It actually sounds like Betty's doing extremely well out there.<eos> I mean, it's been four years, Gordy.<eos> Yeah, four years I couldn't stop thinking about her.<eos> Dude, you and Betty dated for, like, a month.
Unfortunately, to write that paper, I would need Hulk's bones.<eos> And since the Hulk doesn't actually exist...<eos> Trust me, your dissertation committee, they're gonna eat it up.<eos> It's gonna prove that you can think outside the box.<eos> Or, that you've completely lost your mind.
Zombies! ? Come on, you had to have heard of Sharknado.<eos> Those are all scientifically implausible.<eos> But I think that's part of the appeal of B movies-- they offer a mindless escape.<eos> So people enjoy these movies because they don't require them to think?<eos> After a long day at work, don't you ever just want to go home and turn it off?
Makes sense, seeing as he was attacked by a panther.<eos> According to hospital records, he was only treated for scratches to the forearm.<eos> Wait, so you think he was attacked a second time?<eos> I don't know.<eos> We shall swab and see, or rather, you shall swab and see and I will find out what happens with the radioactive meat.
Is everything okay?<eos> There appears to be evidence of buckle fracturing on the angles of the right side ribs seven, eight and nine.<eos> I meant with you.<eos> You've been distant all day.<eos> Angela, do you believe in passion in the workplace?
You're kidding me.<eos> We're questioning you for murder, pal.<eos> Well, I must be in some serious heat if you brought in the big gun.<eos> Uh, actually, I'm the big gun on this.<eos> Uh, yeah, I know big guns, and you are not a big gun.
He was going back to where he felt that he belonged.<eos> Look, having Ron back would only make Linda's job easier.<eos> Why would she kill him?<eos> Because it wasn't about ease.<eos> So Ron coming back to work meant that you were going back to being his number two.
- Does Booth know about this?<eos> -Of course.<eos> He loves my puttanesca.<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> I'll bring the nachos, and you can make your weird, fancy sauce, and we'll see what everyone eats first.
Thank you.<eos> Hey. You okay?<eos> Oh, yeah, I'm great.<eos> It's nothing.<eos> What's important is that you're happy.
Good to see you.<eos> How you feeling this morning?<eos> To be honest, about like our victim.<eos> Hey, don't blame me, I just mixed the drinks.<eos> You're the one that downed a dozen of 'em.
Yeah.<eos> All right.<eos> Thanks.<eos> What's Booth say?<eos> Brennan's in court, so you and I got to go look at a body.
She argued against your innocence, but she mentioned our "compelling evidence"<eos> 19 times.<eos> She did what she had to do to keep her job and undo your conviction.<eos> Sometimes, not often, I underestimate you, Dr. Brennan.<eos> You... stay out of trouble.
- Hey, Avalon.<eos> - Thank goodness.<eos> What's up?<eos> Brennan's father came to me last night, and he's very worried.<eos> All right, look, I know that you take stock in all this stuff, and this mumbo-jumbo things, but if you tell Brennan that you're communing with Max, that's gonna be a problem.
You know how I know that?<eos> Fear.<eos> Fear for your life.<eos> Once you've felt that, everything else, all this so-called civilisation it's a dream.<eos> You've taught me that, my love.
I know, it's mad!<eos> I should have told you when I came in.<eos> That's wonderful, well done.<eos> Oh, Mum!<eos> I'm five years older than you were when you had me.
And it'll go just as well when I'm back from maternity leave.<eos> Honestly, Mum, the department's fine about it.<eos> What if you don't want to go back?<eos> Of course I'll want to.<eos> You did.
Recycling.<eos> He made my skin crawl, actually.<eos> Confident little creep.<eos> Lots of, you know, primate crotch display.<eos> Well, you're the one with all the power, love, that's probably what it was about.
- Adam?<eos> - No.<eos> It's no-one.<eos> 'Gary's friend, Michael, he started base jumping in his forties, flinging himself off cliffs.<eos> At least you don't do that.
Were you there when Mark Costley beat and kicked George Selway to death, Yvonne?<eos> Ijust don't get why you went to him.<eos> Costley's effectively pleading guilty to manslaughter.<eos> If they accept Costley's plea, they still can come after you for murder.<eos> That you have brought into your mess!
Thank you, Detective Inspector Cleveland.<eos> That concludes the case for the Crown, my Lord.<eos> I don't know you at all, dol?<eos> I never did.<eos> And you are all that's standing between me and a prison sentence.
Does it make her... a murderer?<eos> It's time.<eos> Courts aren't about the truth.<eos> They're about who tells the best story.<eos> You know all about that.
D√≠game.<eos> - Are you covering San Benito?<eos> - Like a slanket.<eos> Secretary of State said we're up by 2,000 votes.<eos> What are you hearing?
For what?<eos> I used to lie in bed next to you and listen to you breathe in and out, and I would loathe the sound.<eos> I would resent your right to air.<eos> You were sucking up all the presidential oxygen, the rare air, the air I would've done anything to breathe.<eos> And you didn't even appreciate it.
Quinn, Charlie wants to take you to the Caribbean so he can propose to you.<eos> Unless he wants to kill you.<eos> Which one is it, Charlie?<eos> Do you want to murder her or you want to marry her?<eos> I want to marry you, if you want to marry me.
Mostly.<eos> Mostly?<eos> Maybe you should just go see for yourself.<eos> That's not just a dead body.<eos> You felt it, too, didn't you?
Something's not right.<eos> That arrow, the trip wire, the poison.<eos> These aren't amateurs.<eos> But they've never fought us before.<eos> And you've never fought hunters, Liam.
She's right.<eos> I'm just desperate to see your face.<eos> My life's been a mess ever since you left.<eos> Fallen back into my old ways.<eos> Something you wouldn't tolerate.
And him?<eos> He's seven.<eos> How you doing, Mikey?<eos> Something's happening, isn't it?<eos> First, you come and that person came in our house.
A raconteur.<eos> I don't think that means what you think it means.<eos> Don't speak to me like I don't know French, I know French.<eos> And I'm brown, that's something.<eos> I'll fit in better over there than you will, snowflake.
But with me, we have people at the mosque that have worked over there, people with legal connections that can get us inside of that prison.<eos> Hold on.<eos> You're not saying he gets to go.<eos> He's not any browner than I am.<eos> Ah, but do you speak Arabic?
Yes, Kaniel Outis. Is he here?<eos> He says, yes, the man in the picture is here and we can see him, but only 'cause we're dealing with Sheba.<eos> Why did you say that name?<eos> Because of my brother's jacket.<eos> Thought you were on the right side of God on this.
I understand.<eos> I mean, I could barely even talk to him without sounding like a stupid sympathy card.<eos> It's a lot more complicated for Spencer.<eos> It's hard to imagine Spencer at a loss for words.<eos> Would you know what to say?
Hey, can you not?<eos> Sorry, I had to take that.<eos> It was dad.<eos> Senator daddy.<eos> You must be Hanna?
Hi.<eos> Five minutes.<eos> You were in this world five minutes before I first held you.<eos> And I've been holding on to you ever since.<eos> Yeah, but you're not my mother.
But have Mona pick our top three and I'll send someone to pick them up later.<eos> And text me your Instagram handle.<eos> I'll tag you.<eos> Did I hear that correctly?<eos> Well, I know what I heard. What did you hear?
We always wondered where all that aggression came from.<eos> Stuff that made her such a great competitor.<eos> I remember she had a lot of team spirit.<eos> Yeah, but it was more than that. Right, Emily?<eos> I bet Mrs. Horowitz remembers how you were too, Alison.
- Hi.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - I'm so sorry.<eos> - I meant to call you.<eos> No, you didn't have to call me.
- I just want my life back.<eos> Okay.<eos> I wanna make something beautiful.<eos> No more snarfing, no more shovels.<eos> I mean, this is the first time in my life when I thought that I was doing something important, and then you have to...
Call Katherine.<eos> I will call her right now and straighten her out.<eos> And I want business cards.<eos> Fine.<eos> It'll say you're the boss in gold-leaf embossed, I swear.
"Dearest, it wasn't supposed to be this way.<eos> I did what I did because people like my sister and the Hastings deserve to be punished.<eos> I wanted to hurt them but I never thought there would be someone else who could be hurt.<eos> You come out of hateful act.<eos> But that does not mean that you are hateful.
This is my sister's business.<eos> She needed a brilliant but affordable chef.<eos> - Mary Drake.<eos> - What did she tell you?<eos> She said that you are not my mother my birth mother.
- Her help is dead.<eos> His head rolled over your feet, remember?<eos> Forget Noel Kahn. What about that Sydney What's-Her-Face?<eos> Oh, please. Let's not go there.<eos> Em, you've already been there.
Jenna once tried to use her as a spy, did it...<eos> Okay, it's not about who started the game.<eos> It's-it's how they are getting exactly what they want.<eos> We're all scrambling like mice, like we're still in high school.<eos> You are.
I know how much she means to you.<eos> Don't apologize.<eos> It's my fault.<eos> I have this intense history with the both of you.<eos> You and Ali have your own weird history.
- What's that?<eos> - Gil just left a message.<eos> They want to sign the lease on the field office in Philly so do you wanna see that before it becomes a reality?<eos> Sounds like that would be wise.<eos> Maybe you and I can go down there this afternoon.
'Cause she acted like she was in shock when she found out that we were related to Jason.<eos> I mean, if she knew that dad had already strayed once then why did she put on such a big show?<eos> Why didn't she just tell me then?<eos> Melissa isn't aware of all the circumstances surrounding the... Wow.<eos> So only you and dad could appreciate the bitter irony of me checking into the same mental hospital where I was born.
"people are gonna think that you're a stripper or a junkie or both.<eos> Just hit refresh on that spray tan, hon."<eos> Okay, those aren't from my rack.<eos> You went through my closet?<eos> Well, I wanted her to see the best, and you weren't here.
Don't you think he would have told you?<eos> Why would he?<eos> She was gone.<eos> Well, I don't see why it matters now.<eos> You've got the ring.
And if she strong-arms any of her other teammates and files a formal complaint... Okay.<eos> I'll let Hackett handle this.<eos> I mean, if I confront the kid, it'll be worse.<eos> Like I do have something to hide.<eos> And if you challenge her, she'll turn you into a predator too.
Yeah, you know what, just forward it to me.<eos> Caleb is waiting, and we haven't even started...<eos> Okay, Caleb can wait.<eos> What about shoes?<eos> You and Katherine wear the same size.
- No, I can't do that.<eos> But somebody should have a long time ago.<eos> Probably some poor kid who got off the bus three stops early because they couldn't deal with your dirty looks or the sounds of your snickering two rows behind them.<eos> You wanna know what's inappropriate, Addison? You.<eos> You're inappropriate!
God, no.<eos> I think you should stare at that diamond real hard and think how long it took for a lump of carbon to become that.<eos> I mean, it's like... A million years plus.<eos> Talk about patience.<eos> You can't expect him to be on your timetable, Aria.
But coming back here was a mistake.<eos> Doesn't have to be.<eos> I thought I was over high school.<eos> But it's really hard to be over a place when you're smack dab in it and it feels like so much hasn't changed.<eos> You and Allie are still keeping secrets.
My eggs and I made the decision.<eos> They're my eggs and I made the decision.<eos> You have arrived at your destination.<eos> Are you...?<eos> You shot Spencer.
You have arrived at your destination.<eos> Are you...?<eos> You shot Spencer.<eos> You help Jenna escape.<eos> - You made up the game?
Guys, I have to keep the phone.<eos> PLAY WITH ME, HANNA.<eos> A.D.<eos> It's my turn.<eos> You didn't sleep either?
So now, it's not just casual drink.<eos> It's the Inquisition.<eos> Look, I don't want you getting nervous, okay?<eos> They just need some reassurance.<eos> I'll walk them through the numbers and then you just dazzle them with your designs.
I keep poring over the forensic files from blind school.<eos> I still just can't figure out how we could miss the second firearm.<eos> The brass is all bent out of shape because the Rollins' case is still open.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> No, you needed a win, I needed a break.
The investors are from Japan.<eos> They're gonna be completely offended.<eos> I mean, t-this is the game.<eos> I blow that meeting, and then A.D. makes the story go away.<eos> Meanwhile, the dress pisses off the investors you lose the business, and Lucas loses a lot of money.
I just...<eos> This is amazing, Lucas.<eos> I never realized how much I wanted this until you gave me everything I needed to make it happen.<eos> Oh, that's not true.<eos> You are the one with the talent.
Happiest.<eos> Your eyes are all red.<eos> Can you see?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Do you remember that time when we first met and you... shot a bunch of extra hold hairspray in my face?
When did you do this?<eos> Look, I know it's a little early and I know it's not going to be a permanent situation but I just figured while the baby is here, that...<eos> Em, stop.<eos> This is great.<eos> And you can stay as long as you want.
Now, they're gonna be looking.<eos> And I'm the one who turned Dunhill into roadkill.<eos> Spencer, why the hell were you drunk?<eos> 'Cause I was upset.<eos> And from what I remember, you had a pretty good view.
We owe it to her.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> What does that mean, Hanna?<eos> I don't think that she would have self-sabotaged that night if it wasn't for everything going on with the three of us.<eos> I was there behind the door when you were begging her to let you in.
I know that he still cares about me.<eos> Okay, don't overestimate someone's feeling's for you.<eos> Okay?<eos> It-it's risky.<eos> Okay, well, aren't you taking the same risk?
It's the text from A.D. that was sent this morning.<eos> Hanna has to drop off the hard drive at the school at the exact same time the staff meeting starts at the Radley.<eos> Great, so basically Hanna has to be in two places at once.<eos> It just means that we're working in a tight time frame.<eos> Okay, so Caleb will disable the cameras and, Hanna, you'll grab the credit card slip.
Almost.<eos> We'll just have to broaden the scope of my investigation.<eos> - Of a flood?<eos> - Of a homicide.<eos> Let's hope your friends are as lucky as you are.
You were a crazy person tonight.<eos> Me?<eos> I was scared you were gonna tear Lucas' head off.<eos> I thought he was A.D.<eos> Besides, you were the one that used a Pottery Barn candlestick as a deadly weapon.
Tonight, I'll text you the details.<eos> I'm not happy about this.<eos> Whether you choose to believe me or not...<eos> Concrete proof.<eos> Just remember you asked for it.
- Aria...<eos> You got me to turn against almost every single person that I love.<eos> And all I have to show for it is the cop's on my ass.<eos> I've done everything you asked me to do.<eos> - You've given me nothing.
Of course.<eos> The whole drive up, I thought about just staying on the road.<eos> Just following it someplace else.<eos> And why didn't you?<eos> You know what it's like to be the outsider.
- What other evidence?<eos> What is Furey talking about?<eos> - Did A.D. send him a nose?<eos> - Hanna breathe.<eos> No, you breathe.
Who recorded that conversation?<eos> How should I know?<eos> - It was a hundred years ago.<eos> - Six.<eos> Why would she think that you and Ali's mom wanted to kill her?
I understand you're willing to work for an unusual arrangement.<eos> All cash, no questions asked.<eos> Okay, I'm not sure why you're here, but I don't think it's for the right reasons.<eos> People do things for all sorts of reasons, don't they?<eos> I'm sure you had yours.
I wish that I could change history but I can't.<eos> I fell in love with you, Aria.<eos> And this is where we are now.<eos> And I-I truly believe that we are stronger for having weathered those storms.<eos> Don't you?
- More questions?<eos> - It's my job.<eos> So, why are we in the middle of the streets instead of down at the station?<eos> I thought you might be embarrassed.<eos> I hadn't realized until I spoke with Hanna's mother the other night that you and Caleb Rivers' had ever been more than friends.
Yeah, I don't have any answers for you.<eos> Oh, but you did have the cash to pay off a medical school loan bill overnight.<eos> Shall I read you the statement?<eos> You went through my mail?<eos> We have what you want, you have what we want.
If you'd kept quiet, I wouldn't have checked the trunk and I would have driven straight to Spencer and the others with you in the back.<eos> The police, they would have received an anonymous tip.<eos> That-that is what A.D. wanted.<eos> You're dead.<eos> You know everything.
I remembered some unfinished business.<eos> I have something for you, a going-away gift.<eos> You're smiling.<eos> I just, I didn't think to get you anything.<eos> You're not the one leaving.
You're gonna tell them how you made everybody's life a living hell.<eos> But first, we're gonna pick up the game just so they can see your handy work.<eos> I don't have it anymore.<eos> Somebody stole it from me somebody's always stealing the game from me.<eos> If you don't have it, who does?
Yeah, maybe that's how Mona got out the night that Charlotte was killed.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - No, not you.<eos> I'm not letting you down any more holes.<eos> I'm not letting you go down there by yourself.
But you couldn't fool me.<eos> You always were the smart one, Mona, not Spencer.<eos> Now, you're out, and you think you can start hurting people again?<eos> Well, I'm not gonna let that happen.<eos> Who's gonna stop me, is it you?
People will think you committed suicide your first night home.<eos> How's that?<eos> Jump.<eos> Jump or I'll push you.<eos> I'm giving you more of a chance than you ever gave any of us.
Some enhanced interrogation and Mona could be gone forever.<eos> That may have already happened.<eos> Why is she dressed like that?<eos> She went back to a safe place.<eos> The one place before everything went wrong where the worst she had to worry about was you being mean to her in the cafeteria.
How does that make you feel?<eos> Please, Mona, d-don't.<eos> "Please, Mona, don't."<eos> Now, you know what it's like to be really afraid.<eos> The way you made us feel
She knows not to hurt him.<eos> You were so obsessed with Michael that you would risk my son!<eos> Michael?<eos> You mean you.<eos> You don't love me.
Now where is my son?<eos> You ask questions you know there isn't a chance in hell I'm gonna answer.<eos> So we're back to the game.<eos> The truth is, we never left.<eos> You're not holding the cards.
Michael, pick up the body, make it look like it never happened.<eos> Genius, really.<eos> But no one will ever go for it.<eos> The truth is whatever you tell people it is.<eos> You taught me that.
Yeah.<eos> I've been running, too.<eos> I know.<eos> Why'd you call her?<eos> Because I knew you wouldn't.
Are you serious?<eos> Has this just been about sex for you this whole time?<eos> Because that's really disappointing.<eos> Oh, so now I'm disappointing?<eos> Sorry, how's that fair when you're the one keeping the secrets? We're done here.
You'll thank me later.<eos> You're only gonna make it worse.<eos> Where are we going?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You swallow, I swallow.
This place is so huge.<eos> I've been house-sitting all summer, but yet I still can't find my way around.<eos> I can't believe anybody actually lives here.<eos> Me either.<eos> Did you take all these?
Are you serious?<eos> He really needs to be there for you.<eos> I know.<eos> What would you do if it was Tyler's baby?<eos> I mean, like, what would you do if it was you and it was Tyler's baby?
You're so pretty.<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> I'll tell you a secret.<eos> I always wanted a little sister.<eos> So maybe... you and I can just hang out, us girls.
He had my heart, and I had his.<eos> Then ask him... if that's what love is.<eos> It's not manipulation.<eos> Even if it means you have to let him go.<eos> You need to let him go.
If you'd just told me, I would've been on board.<eos> Good on ya, man.<eos> They're playing checkers, my boy Blaine is playing Monopoly.<eos> So I'm clear, this is my business?<eos> You and Chief had me going out and getting food orders for you.
You deserve an Emmy.<eos> I mean, you're TV good, let's not get carried away.<eos> Daniel Day Lewis ain't shaking in his boots.<eos> You had me mopping up.<eos> You'd send me out of the room when you and Chief were talking business.
Uh, Major...<eos> A hero's return.<eos> It's gonna get bad now.<eos> Now that you've been cleared.<eos> You think?
My dog was digging in the neighbor's trash, and when I was cleaning up, I found brains in there.<eos> They were in these tubes, kind of like those...<eos> Liv.<eos> Liv, it's gonna be okay.<eos> Like you said, no one but the lunatic fringe listens to this show.
This brain I'm on is wearing off.<eos> I shot my boyfriend, Clive.<eos> He's dead because of me.<eos> He was already dead.<eos> What you did was merciful.
Oh, Klaus, we could have handed you over.<eos> Instead, Marcel fed you blood.<eos> I took the spell off them chains.<eos> We gave you a fighting chance.<eos> And what chance will you have?
If any of my family are ever bitten again, we'll need more.<eos> Which means we'll need you alive.<eos> Count yourself fortunate.<eos> We had a deal.<eos> You had a deal with Hayley.
It's not weird, Jasper.<eos> It is weird that you can code when you're not a coder, though, right?<eos> It's like A.L.I.E. upgraded your brain.<eos> You ok?<eos> Are you?
Back off, Bellamy.<eos> Your king is my friend.<eos> Let us help him.<eos> I saw you in the City of Light.<eos> I know you destroyed it.
- Now we wait.<eos> Trikru accepts this?<eos> They're not happy about it.<eos> Not much they can do now, though, is there, without an army.<eos> You were there.
Then help me save them.<eos> Roan, listen to me.<eos> You wanted an Ice Nation Commander.<eos> With this, you control who ascends.<eos> There will never be a Commander to rule over Azgeda unless you allow it.
That's spot-on-the-nose perfect, darlin'.<eos> But just for the sake of an experiment, would you mind passing me that bottle over there?<eos> Ohh, yeah.<eos> You're gonna be drunk.<eos> Oh, honey if you had to lay down as much bullshit as I'm about to lay down tonight, you'd get drunk, too.
Armando cut the fence, and he looked the other way when them Mexers stole your property.<eos> I tell you, my friend, he admitted to all of it.<eos> In the end.<eos> Jesus, Niles.<eos> You and your daddy ain't exactly strangers to backcountry adjudication.
I asked him to sniff around about, see who was hitting our cattle.<eos> And you didn't consider how he might interpret that?<eos> I don't want this family in bed with the Law and Order League.<eos> And I don't want the home I spent my whole life building to get snatched out from underneath our noses.<eos> Sometimes it feels like I'm in the front of the boat bailing water while you're behind me drilling holes.
I don't want this family in bed with the Law and Order League.<eos> And I don't want the home I spent my whole life building to get snatched out from underneath our noses.<eos> Sometimes it feels like I'm in the front of the boat bailing water while you're behind me drilling holes.<eos> Who's running this ranch, Daddy... you or me?<eos> Well... allegedly, you are.
All right?<eos> They could be the first to discover oil here and get ahead of the wave that's about to come.<eos> Plus, we're offering 1/8th royalties.<eos> No one else is gonna come even close to that.<eos> You got something to say over there?
It was obvious they were gonna kill Momma, but I don't think they meant to kill Lizzie.<eos> After you shot that Indian, the others began shooting the house, and Lizzie was hit.<eos> When they saw she was shot, they looked over her wounds.<eos> I thought maybe they were gonna doctor her, but... they must have decided she wasn't gonna make it.<eos> You got Lizzie killed, Eli.
Oh, thanks, John.<eos> That means a lot coming from you.<eos> Now, listen, can I bend your ear and we talk a little business outside?<eos> Sure.<eos> You're buying the drinks.
Dinner is half an hour!<eos> - Your father and mother are eating out.<eos> - Are you on that dating app again? - No.<eos> Come on, what?<eos> - You know what I'm doing.
Your father would rather you and I have this talk, okay?<eos> Right.<eos> It's not that he doesn't care.<eos> He cares too much.<eos> You don't know.
I mean, it's pretty.<eos> Dad and Susan are gonna kick me out, or drag me to that treatment.<eos> - Okay, so eat.<eos> - I eat.<eos> You know that I love you like a full sister, but you look like absolute crap.
And you're some kind of artist?<eos> Your...<eos> Well, that lady said you're kind of famous.<eos> She's nuts.<eos> But you had, like, a crazy fan or something.
Hey, what happened to that sweet girl that I met at Transitions?<eos> - The Mexican.<eos> - Angel?<eos> - Mm-hmm. - Her mom's from El Salvador.<eos> You know what I mean.
- Jesus, Mom.<eos> Just because her mom is gay does not mean that she's gay.<eos> You know, you can get married now.<eos> I'm not saying you are.<eos> I'm just saying, you know, if you... if you have that kind of turmoil, then you might feel like you don't deserve to eat.
It's not about "thin enough," right?<eos> There's no "thin enough." It doesn't exist.<eos> What you crave is the numbing of the thing that you don't wanna feel.<eos> And we give you a lot of rope here.<eos> It's scary, but only you can decide... to see what's good, to be alive.
- How do you know you got it all?<eos> When your barf is clear and it doesn't burn anymore. Oh.<eos> I wish I could barf.<eos> I'm only good at the binging part.<eos> - You purge?
Organ tissue.<eos> Pretty soon, you're gonna be flopping around like a boneless fish.<eos> Thanks for that.<eos> Yeah, I'm scared straight.<eos> Anna, you're next!
No.<eos> How about...<eos> "Eli"?<eos> Call me "Eli."<eos> - You get your iPad?
I just...<eos> - Okay.<eos> - I...<eos> I need to do my research.<eos> And you... need to be touched by someone who actually cares about you.
People say they love you... but what they mean is, they love how loving you makes them feel about themselves. Or... Or they love what they can take from you.<eos> I don't even know where to start with that.<eos> That's all kinds of wrong.<eos> I'm done.<eos> Okay, all right, you win!
It takes up all my time, and I... I like it that way.<eos> Women generally wanna spend time with somebody they date.<eos> Sounds like you're avoiding intimacy, doctor.<eos> Yeah, I guess it does.<eos> Lobo also tells me that you and Luke aren't speaking.
This idea you have that there's a way to be safe... it's childish and cowardly.<eos> It stops you from experiencing anything, including anything good.<eos> You don't think I feel bad enough already?<eos> I know I'm messed up... but you're supposed to teach me how not to be.<eos> You know how.
We all buy the hype, but nobody here is getting any better.<eos> - That's not true.<eos> - Yeah? Megan's screwed.<eos> Anna has a treasure chest of puke under her bed.<eos> You live in fucking Ponyland.
I can't.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I'm actually out of here.<eos> Did you hear what I said?<eos> I'm finished. And you're leaving?
Did you hear what I said?<eos> I'm finished. And you're leaving?<eos> I can't.<eos> What, you think I didn't guess my knee was fucked?<eos> And now that I'm done doing the one thing that makes me feel, you're my next thing.
Where is he?<eos> Hold my broom. And I'll go find him.<eos> How did you do that?<eos> A lot of practice.<eos> You're the master.
What's in it for me, huh?<eos> How about I don't snap your neck?<eos> Let's not do this, huh?<eos> Do what?<eos> Well, I just... The thing where every time I talk, you threaten to kill me.
Still taunting me.<eos> No.<eos> No, he's gone.<eos> And he's never coming back.<eos> You are the baron now.
How about you?<eos> What?<eos> Let me handle this.<eos> Your baron said we were free to go.<eos> What you and your men did to those dolls.
I should have poisoned you when I had the chance.<eos> Previously on AMC's "Into the Badlands"...<eos> Don't start what you can't finish.<eos> Kill me!<eos> You trained The Widow.
I don't know what I think you are anymore.<eos> First you betray Veil.<eos> Then Sunny.<eos> Now your own Regent?<eos> You and Quinn deserve each other.
Well, the other Barons are all but dead.<eos> Someone has to take their place.<eos> Well, I thought there were no Barons in your perfect new world, only free women and men.<eos> Or have you forgotten about that already?<eos> You're the one who told me not to burn it all down at once.
Where am I?<eos> Oh, let's have a think.<eos> Uh, cold, dark, locked away?<eos> Seems like we found our way into The Widow's heart.<eos> Who are you?
- Let's just go.<eos> Are you gonna tell her? Or shall I?<eos> Look, I swear, I didn't mean for anyone to get hurt.<eos> I didn't know what The Widow would do.<eos> You turned them in?
You can hardly walk.<eos> Then take care of Sunny and M.K.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You have my word.<eos> And you, take care of her.
He's surrounded by civilians, so drones and air strikes are out.<eos> We're working up a CONOPS.<eos> Command wants us to take a shot tonight.<eos> You know how many times we've rolled snake eyes with this guy?<eos> So, what do you think?
We're all getting old, amigo.<eos> Ah, not me, man.<eos> I'm-a live hard, die young, leave a beautiful corpse.<eos> I can see two of three coming true.<eos> Who are you?
You're really going through with this.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Got some papers to sign, bro.<eos> So, sign them and get the hell out of here.<eos> Yeah, whatever you say, boss.
Sir, my team wants that mission.<eos> I already tasked you with it.<eos> You guys are on a short leash while we develop the target package.<eos> One hour recall till further notice.<eos> I didn't know Rip was in Africa, did you?
Remember how many kids you told me you wanted?<eos> Four.<eos> And now we just want one.<eos> I need a baby.<eos> And so do you.
Separation gift for Buddha.<eos> That's funny.<eos> Lena said you were making a new crib.<eos> What's on your mind?<eos> I'm just as mad about Rip as you are, so I'm not gonna take your shit personal.
You might as well have gut-shot him.<eos> I didn't tell Rip anything he didn't know himself.<eos> That's why he left.<eos> You lose it like he did, I'll do the same thing to you.<eos> Well, that's where you and I are different.
The reward was on the ship.<eos> The guy might've told us where Rip was.<eos> By now, he's had a chance to clam up.<eos> Maybe yes, maybe no, but there's a right and a wrong way to do things.<eos> And you decide what's right and what's wrong?
But what I'm wondering...<eos> And, Buddha, you can let me know if I'm way off here... Is, maybe you want to save Rip too much.<eos> I asked that man to be the godfather to my daughter.<eos> Do you remember that?<eos> 'Cause you were there, and so were you.
Bertina...<eos> That's my sister...<eos> She doesn't know how to feed my bird.<eos> If I am not there, who will feed him?<eos> Did you put her up to this?
Meet me in Qatar in two days.<eos> How did you find out where I lived?<eos> Court records, Alex.<eos> They're public.<eos> Did you make this?
This... is a symbol of the brothers that you have sworn to protect.<eos> Uh-huh. Okay, so... you guard him with your life.<eos> Hey, Ghetto, if that needs some air, you know where to blow it, don't you?<eos> Oh, you can show him, Buck.<eos> You had him last.
About... About what?<eos> About nothing.<eos> Eddie is free to come and go as he pleases.<eos> I'm a man of my word.<eos> You, however, is a different story.
- Sure.<eos> - Tell him.<eos> Vince has a big player who's cheating.<eos> And what does that have to do with me?<eos> Well, he can't spot it, and he thinks you can.
Marius, is this... is this part of the plan, or are you just making this shit up as you go along?<eos> Call the FBI... special agent in charge Michael Dumbrovski.<eos> He'll confirm everything I'm telling you.<eos> My God, you're good.<eos> You're the fixer, right?
How about to Vegas with me?<eos> Vegas?<eos> I'm buying a stake in a little casino.<eos> You can deal or, I don't know, security.<eos> You choose.
I'm buying a stake in a little casino.<eos> You can deal or, I don't know, security.<eos> You choose.<eos> You always wanted to deal in Vegas.<eos> - Yeah, but you hate Vegas. - I do.
Well, that's because god's on our side.<eos> Amen, brother.<eos> You know, at first, it's like a video game... "call of duty" shit.<eos> Then you realize those hajjis shoot back.<eos> You get even better at pulling that trigger.
They will say I brought shame on my family, just like the girls.<eos> You were raped by boko haram, na'omi.<eos> My father will say I should've married...<eos> Been under a man's protection.<eos> You don't understand.
- To Lena.<eos> - And Joe.<eos> - To Lena and Joe!<eos> - To Lena and Joe!<eos> Now, how come you and rip never had kids, Gloria.
He's got teenage boys already.<eos> It's all dick jokes and barhopping.<eos> So the camel says to the elephant,<eos> "what are you laughing at?<eos> You're the one with a dick on your face!"
Left, and then right.<eos> See?<eos> Alternate the thumbs, up and down.<eos> Get a nice, tight roll going.<eos> Chuck, I think you're the one that needs a nice, tight roll.
- 'Course I will.<eos> Do the wills.<eos> They're my clients.<eos> They're my clients.<eos> You and I aren't partners, remember?
Right, because you're an ambulance-chasing piece of shit, 'cause you're all the same... you're the same as all the others.<eos> Always on a high horse.<eos> Always trying to make me feel like I'm...<eos> Look, um, I'm a lawyer, and this is what I do all day, every day, so h-how about this?<eos> I-I won't fly jet planes... you, uh, stay out of court.
You moved it up almost three weeks.<eos> I'll give it another shot and see if I can do better.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> Kevin'll be popping champagne!<eos> I knew you were the right one for this.
We'll discuss it with the surgeon.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Maybe it wasn't meant to be.<eos> Quitting... It's not an option.<eos> Navy SEAL, you killed this man.
We are dead men.<eos> Is the stupid seal worth that?<eos> Yes.<eos> He is.<eos> Muttaqi will understand, even if you don't.
He hated injustice.<eos> He hated the strong preying on the weak.<eos> And then you murdered him.<eos> If you're looking for blood, look on your own hands.<eos> Now, you're a good woman.
The first time Boko Haram raped me I wanted to die.<eos> I wanted to die.<eos> But then you told me I had to be strong for the girls.<eos> And so I was.<eos> Now you have to be strong for them.
Let us help you.<eos> Pray with me, Joe.<eos> Okay.<eos> Jesus, we ask you in the name of the Lord to bring peace to this member of your flock.<eos> For you are the eternal shepherd.
I'm...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's... Look, it's not your fault.<eos> I just wish I were you.<eos> You are the lucky one.
You should've let me know.<eos> I could've made arrangements for you to have a much safer passage to the facility.<eos> The prince wants me to cut off my hand for stealing.<eos> He says I stole his trust.<eos> I didn't tell him it's because you stole mine.
It's my path.<eos> I have to live like I'm already dead.<eos> I think it would be a good idea if... you weren't around anymore.<eos> Okay.<eos> But, then, you came to see me.
- The government is being targeted.<eos> You are being targeted.<eos> - I'm a no one.<eos> - You are government to them.<eos> You don't understand being a Yemeni.
Like who shot JFK?<eos> I am trying to be serious here.<eos> No, you're doped up on painkillers and you're thinking too much.<eos> I promise this has nothing to do with you.<eos> You rest.
And... this is Kaniel Outis.<eos> That's ridiculous.<eos> The record here at State says<eos> - that... that's Kaniel Outis's face.<eos> - Okay, but you and I both know who Michael Scofield was.
Because only somebody very formidable would be capable of officially turning one man into another.<eos> It would take a genius... like Michael.<eos> You're insinuating that he did this?<eos> He disappeared, just quit on his life?<eos> I want answers just like you do.
Whatever name you want to call him,<eos> Michael's a murderer, Sara.<eos> Hey.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> You all right?
Why?<eos> Maybe I'll tell you one day.<eos> They're destroying our city.<eos> Your ISIL friends are destroying our city.<eos> And you come in here wanting help.
We're all dead.<eos> Shh, shh, shh. Quiet.<eos> You... You are not ISIL?<eos> No.<eos> But you're Mohammad El-Tunis, I take it?
And I got pinned, too.<eos> I hate to say it, Linc, but I think we might've just got pinned as well.<eos> You okay?<eos> You look like you could use a few sharp edges knocked off your world.<eos> You don't look so good yourself.
I can equip you with a fully articulate prosthetic.<eos> - Who's behind this?<eos> - Nobody.<eos> - This is Kaniel Outis.<eos> - Okay, but you and I both know
But what if you're acting like you're on my side till the moment you're not?<eos> You are getting paranoid.<eos> Yeah, well, four years in the box is gonna do that to you.<eos> I'm not leaving you behind.<eos> - You're my whip hand.
What do you need a Korean junkie<eos> - like me for?<eos> - Korean genius, you mean.<eos> Getting over that wall is just the start.<eos> Once that happens, there are things only you can do.
Yeah, all right.<eos> Sheba!<eos> Who are these men you work with?<eos> They're beneath you.<eos> You're beneath me.
Who are these men?<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> They're leaving.<eos> I am not the bad guy here.<eos> You and I have a history.
I'm going to be a ski jumper.<eos> You've never seen snow, have you?<eos> That's the point.<eos> Everything in my life till now in this country... The heat, the hate, the skies that never snow.<eos> You talk about the world.
I'm sorry.<eos> I don't think I'm going to.<eos> Well, okay, I just want to let you know that I figured out who was hacking your phone.<eos> Who?<eos> You... hacked your own phone.
I am the distance.<eos> Good.<eos> Because you're gonna have a conversation with Paul Kellerman for me.<eos> Bull. Kellerman's behind this?<eos> And you are gonna get every shred of information you can about what's really going on.
What are you doing in this cell?<eos> They're on the roof!<eos> Don't shoot!<eos> I trusted you, Kaniel Outis.<eos> And you lied to me.
I think I'm just gonna go home.<eos> Ol, it's not healthy to be alone right now.<eos> No, I... Actually, I think that's exactly what I need, so...<eos> Laurel thinks it was you.<eos> - And what do you think?
God.<eos> Laurel.<eos> Don't tell anyone.<eos> Why not?<eos> The same reason you didn't want to tell us about Asher.
It's not just some other girl.<eos> I'm just saying, maybe you need to be alone for a second.<eos> How would you know what I need?<eos> This is the most we've ever talked.<eos> Well... it's not like you come talk to me, either.
It's who... It's who I am.<eos> It's who we all are.<eos> We are bad people.<eos> No.<eos> No, you're not.
You don't know her.<eos> Not like me.<eos> I know that she deserves better than you.<eos> And you think that's you?<eos> I'd never hurt her the way you have.
If they sell her out, which you know they want to do, then we all go down.<eos> - Maybe we should.<eos> - No!<eos> When are we gonna stop helping Annalise, when it only makes things worse?<eos> You are the only one getting us in trouble right now.
Come in.<eos> - Should I come back?<eos> - No, we're done.<eos> Oh, keep it open.<eos> You're the one who cried sexual harassment.
Yet here I sit.<eos> No charge in sight.<eos> Wes didn't die in the fire, man.<eos> The M.E. report says he did.<eos> So did you, in your... confession.
It is in your interest to negotiate with us.<eos> He didn't have a mother figure, so you just stepped right in and took advantage of that.<eos> Speaking to my client in this way<eos> - is an abuse of power.<eos> - But that's what you do.
You insinuated yourself into this boy's life.<eos> This meeting is over.<eos> You abused your power as his teacher.<eos> You ruined his life.<eos> You did this.
Get up in the morning and go to class, listen to me complain about my role.<eos> You don't have a role.<eos> See?<eos> Even that... pretending like things can be normal again.<eos> I don't know how you've been doing this by yourself this whole time.
I won't.<eos> We dated off and on since first year.<eos> When you say "off and on"...<eos> It wasn't the most stable relationship.<eos> So you broke up last spring, and then you started dating Wes.
Your ball hearing will be set under the rules of criminal procedure.<eos> Until then, you will be residing in the county prison.<eos> Clearly, you're still hung up on this girl, so... why don't we find her?<eos> Can't be too hard to locate a white girl with cornrows.<eos> You killed her.
Previously on "How To Get Away With Murder"...<eos> Frank turned himself in last night.<eos> You ruined his life.<eos> You did this.
Uh, yay to getting out of here finally, is what I mean.<eos> I brought some options.<eos> Although I think I need to see them on to know which one looks best.<eos> Oh, there she go, Casey Freakin' Anthony, off to another one of her special hearings.<eos> Casey Anthony was acquitted, and you the only one in here being charged with hurting they own kids.
- No, you can't, Mama.<eos> - I can.<eos> I can.<eos> All I have to do is to tell the police the truth.<eos> You didn't burn down the house.
Give me a hug!<eos> Let's go sit.<eos> Oh, my baby.<eos> I'm the mother.<eos> You're the child.
For what?<eos> Everything.<eos> I don't know why I'm here.<eos> I don't.<eos> I guess I just wanted to look you in the eye finally 'cause I haven't wanted to believe that it's true that you did... that you did that to Wes.
The Commonwealth can move Ms. Keating into solitary confinement.<eos> If Ms. Keating isn't released on bail, I'm releasing these photos to the press and announcing a very public lawsuit against the D.A.'s office for civil rights violations.<eos> It's months before the trial.<eos> She'll be dead if we leave her in that jail.<eos> Who the hell are you?
It's months before the trial.<eos> She'll be dead if we leave her in that jail.<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> Beyonc√©.<eos> Who the hell are you?
I am a good liar.<eos> I know.<eos> I just said that.<eos> There's another lie, is what I mean.<eos> You know, the first thing you learn when you hack a system is to make sure you have an escape route that only you know about.
I've been in your place, thinking you owe her things.<eos> I just need to talk to her.<eos> - So she can play you again?<eos> - She knew my mother.<eos> He said you were looking out for him... ever since he was a kid got him into law school.
It is... and we should do something.<eos> These people are dangerous.<eos> So what... we're just gonna sit around and act weak and victim-y?<eos> No one's acting like a victim.<eos> You are.
Oliver, what if she's hiding something?<eos> Then I think we should respect her wishes, and let it stay hidden.<eos> Is that why you saved a copy?<eos> Because I think you did because your gut's telling you that Annalise is being sketchy.<eos> You didn't see her that night.
The fact that you don't know is exactly why you should re-hire you lawyer.<eos> Did you just imply I'm stupid?<eos> You're acting stupid.<eos> Even the fact that we're meeting here.<eos> It makes it look like you and Annalise are colluding, which is... maybe what you want.
So just admit what you need rather than whatever game this is.<eos> You're right.<eos> Okay?<eos> You're right.<eos> Bonnie said you've been holding everyone up.
Yummy, yummy, yummy in your tummy, tummy, tummy.<eos> Who's in there?<eos> Uh, no one.<eos> Michaela!<eos> Who are you?
Are you sure?<eos> Yes. What's your problem?<eos> You don't... think it's a little convenient that she came over at the exact same time that you're hacking her phone?<eos> No, I think you're being paranoid.<eos> And you're being naive.
You don't... think it's a little convenient that she came over at the exact same time that you're hacking her phone?<eos> No, I think you're being paranoid.<eos> And you're being naive.<eos> Okay, I'm being naive.<eos> And yet, here I am, going through her phone records because you wanted me to.
We owe him that.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey, so, uh... I did something kind of stupid.<eos> Oli?<eos> All this time, you've been telling me Annalise was hiding something when you're the one with the secret.
We don't know who killed him.<eos> He testified against Charles Mahoney a week before he died.<eos> Laurel.<eos> Wes was cremated.<eos> All this time, you've been telling me Annalise was hiding something when you're the one with a secret.
I'll think about it.<eos> Where have you been?<eos> - Running.<eos> - For two hours?<eos> You'll be the one that benefits when I have abs.
Great, so, we sit here and wait for her to come kill us, too.<eos> She's not gonna kill us.<eos> - She's gonna pay someone to kill us.<eos> - No one's getting killed.<eos> You said so yourself that these chuckleheads are dangerous.
Yeah, 'cause you left him there to die!<eos> There was gas!<eos> I smelled gas.<eos> Whoever killed him cut the gas line.<eos> - You mean you cut the gas line.
We're offering you a plea deal.<eos> Admit Annalise ordered you to kill Wes, and you'll be out in seven years.<eos> Your case against Annalise is in the toilet.<eos> Maybe it's time you just give up.<eos> If the judge throws out Annalise's case, my office is gonna have to come up with an alternative theory... like... you and Laurel Castillo killed Wes.
Admit Annalise ordered you to kill Wes, and you'll be out in seven years.<eos> Your case against Annalise is in the toilet.<eos> Maybe it's time you just give up.<eos> If the judge throws out Annalise's case, my office is gonna have to come up with an alternative theory... like... you and Laurel Castillo killed Wes.<eos> She was in the house that night, as were you, according to your confession.
How?<eos> By telling the police that she wasn't at the house that night.<eos> That doesn't mean she didn't do this.<eos> Bonnie told you, right?<eos> This whole time, I've been telling everyone that you killed Wes.
Do you know that Michaela and them wouldn't even talk to me at Wes' memorial?<eos> That wasn't about you.<eos> They were just really worried about how I lost my mind up there on the altar.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I just... I miss him, and I know that you do, too, which is why I shouldn't have shut you out.
No.<eos> I have an idea.<eos> There's nothing in Wes' autopsy about the cracked rib, so you can put me on the stand, and I'll tell the truth.<eos> It'll prove that the M.E. lied in her report and invalidate the D.A.'s entire case.<eos> That could make Denver think you killed Wes.
I didn't say that.<eos> I had a job interview with Anthony and Levin to try and salvage what's left of my career after Annalise destroyed it.<eos> You destroyed your career the minute you forged my signature.<eos> And I have been kicking myself about that ever since.<eos> I don't need you kicking me, too.
You wouldn't be in this mess unless someone was twisting your arm.<eos> I told you... There is no one.<eos> Someone's gonna find out the truth.<eos> And they might not be as understanding as me.<eos> You're looking out for yourself.
More time won't change my decision.<eos> While it's true that A.D.A. Atwood engaged in heinous misconduct, it doesn't cancel out the abundance of evidence against Ms. Keating.<eos> Defense's motion to dismiss is denied.<eos> Well, that was a big waste of time.<eos> You think?
- I'm sorry. I raided your fridge.<eos> - Think about the amount of times that he's lied to you... When he cheated on you, when he chopped up Sam's body into little pieces.<eos> Okay, can we please just be nice to each other?<eos> He's been kidnapped, Laurel!<eos> Maybe you coped fine in that situation, but Connor didn't grow up in a drug cartel.
Sparkling water is fine.<eos> Feel free.<eos> The same for me.<eos> Thank you, Clara.<eos> So... you called me.
- How are you still defending him?<eos> - I'm his mother.<eos> - That's my job.<eos> - No, it's your job to raise a good son.<eos> How would you know?
- She used to be a good detective.<eos> - Better than you.<eos> I still know when a boat I'm on is sinking.<eos> Where's Connor Walsh?<eos> You ever consider you're the one on the boat?
Annalise, it's Wes.<eos> I just got to the house.<eos> I was at the police station.<eos> They found Rebecca's body.<eos> They're saying you did it... all of it... even Sam.
I'm doing these for your benefit.<eos> Maybe you'll actually love me if I have abs.<eos> God, just... let me explain, please.<eos> "I don't know" is the truth.<eos> I really, really wish I did know so that I could honestly say it or not say it, but what I don't think is fair is for me to say it just because you want me to or because you said it first.
We could fight to the death, or we can put all this behind us.<eos> How?<eos> I'm gonna tell you what you're gonna find on my phone.<eos> They found Rebecca's body.<eos> They're saying you did it... all of it... even Sam.
Connor Walsh found the burner phone you used to frame me in your possession.<eos> He'll testify to that in court.<eos> - You think anyone will believe him?<eos> - You want me to come after you<eos> - the way you came after me?
- You think anyone will believe him?<eos> - You want me to come after you<eos> - the way you came after me?<eos> - You mean kill me?<eos> You're the only killer in this room.
Hello, Annalise.<eos> I lost someone.<eos> He was a student of mine.<eos> They found Rebecca's body.<eos> They're saying you did it... all of it... even Sam.
100 yards!<eos> Just when you think it couldn't get worse locked up in a Porta Potti, they start dropping 2,000-pound bombs on the Porta Potti.<eos> Whip. Keep it together, please.<eos> The escape artist is nervous.<eos> You should be, too.
You and C-Note get the others to the airport as fast as you can...<eos> There's maybe one flight out.<eos> Save two seats.<eos> All right?<eos> What are you going to do?
- We are going to go in there and get Abu Ramal!<eos> - No! Please!<eos> - No!<eos> Please!<eos> And you are going to be the one who's going to help me do it.
- No!<eos> Please!<eos> And you are going to be the one who's going to help me do it.<eos> - No!<eos> - You sent him!
One man manipulating a handful of others.<eos> Abu Ramal is a monster.<eos> And there's a spot in Hell reserved for him, but the hottest spot is reserved for Poseidon, because he is letting Ramal loose on the world again.<eos> Those men, they have the blood of thousands, thousands on their hands.<eos> Compared to them, you and me are a couple of angels.
Take the long way around while your friend... gets here first to get weapons.<eos> You were going to screw me.<eos> That's the American slang.<eos> - Isn't it?<eos> - You were gonnacrew me.
Well, I....<eos> I don't even know....<eos> In what world is that anything but the deepest betrayal... of everything we worked so hard to accomplish?<eos> In what world is it anything but the deepest betrayal of friendship?<eos> I could argue you're the one who betrayed me.
I worked most of last week on maybe six hours of sleep, and then I....<eos> I crossed three lanes of traffic and I don't remember any of it.<eos> Look, you were just doing what you thought you had to do.<eos> Because of me.<eos> You didn't make me get in that car.
- Yes.<eos> There's a lot of prep that we pushed... so you could focus on getting Mr. Gatwood up by the end of the quarter.<eos> Which isn't happening now.<eos> Actually, I talked with Colleen... and she said everyone's fine doing that meeting Monday.<eos> So, you know, that means we could still slide in... just under the deadline.
And I'm telling you don't bother.<eos> What's the point?<eos> - You're just gonna keep hurting people.<eos> - That's not true.<eos> Jimmy, this is what you do.
You hurt people.<eos> Over and over and over.<eos> And then there's this show of remorse.<eos> - It's not a show.<eos> - I know you don't think it's a show.
So stop apologizing and accept it.<eos> Embrace it.<eos> Frankly, I'd have more respect for you if you did.<eos> What about you, Chuck?<eos> You didn't do anything wrong?
You don't have to make up with me.<eos> We don't have to understand each other.<eos> Things are fine the way they are.<eos> Hey.<eos> I don't want to hurt your feelings... but the truth is you've never mattered all that much to me.
Alaskan cruise.<eos> You can walk on a glacier under the Aurora Borealis.<eos> And if Alaska's too cold, maybe a European river cruise.<eos> Float on down the Danube.<eos> You and the ladies could split a deluxe suite.
She just wanted to get back on our good side.<eos> Okay, how do you trust someone who bends any way the wind is blowing?<eos> Where is her integrity?<eos> Well, I can't help but blame myself.<eos> - You were just trying to help.
- No.<eos> I stuck my nose in where it didn't belong and I stirred the pot.<eos> So....<eos> Look, if you wanna blame someone... you should blame me.<eos> Jimmy, you're a good friend.
No, I wasn't in love with him.<eos> Well, a little, but....<eos> No, I wanted to be him.<eos> Fight the good fight, change the world?<eos> Yeah. Didn't you?
It's fine.<eos> I already talked to my old supervisor.<eos> Looks like they can take me back, so....<eos> Oh, that's great.<eos> And, you know, if we ever get another office up... you'd be our first call.
Kim, it's pointless.<eos> They're smearing my name across the tristate area... sending telegrams to everyone far and near.<eos> You never know.<eos> It's a good wall.<eos> - You think?
- Okay.<eos> I know it was a very traumatic breakup for her, but I'm nervous.<eos> I read that women over 35 are 53% more likely to end up alone.<eos> - I read that in the Sunday Times.<eos> Have you heard about that?
I thought of signing her up with OkCupid.<eos> Isn't that what they call it?<eos> But it's not your decision.<eos> For all you know, Rebecca might already be on OkCupid or dating.<eos> See, if you keep trying to control her, she's gonna keep pushing you away.
Yeah, well, I'm a journalist, so it can be kind of corporate.<eos> Anything I would have read? No.<eos> I do mostly freelance, op-ed pieces, things like that.<eos> What?<eos> It's just, you're not exactly our typical kind of customer.
Dolly, upstairs, please.<eos> Upstairs, please.<eos> You gotta go to bed.<eos> I'll clean up.<eos> You go deal with Little Miss Sexy.
You're not getting emotionally involved again, are you?<eos> No, of course not.<eos> Just reminds me of that time before Dolly, when I was losing my mind, breaking up with you every other day.<eos> You were fine.<eos> No, you were fine.
That's just...<eos> Shouldn't Alexis be out on a date as opposed to e-mailing you right now?<eos> Hey. She's not my type, for the record.<eos> Good.<eos> 'Cause you are definitely my type.
- Larin.<eos> It's just about the thing tonight.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> - God, I'm so not in the mood for this.<eos> - You were the one that suggested it.
Let's get a drink.<eos> - What, now?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Or are you busy or something?<eos> - Aren't you busy?
You nicked my catalogue money and spent it on bloody weed!<eos> I never did!<eos> So how'd you pay for that weed then? !<eos> Someone give it me!<eos> And you've no business smoking bloody weed anyway!
Julie?<eos> All right, Kinchie?<eos> Do the police know you're doing this?<eos> Going door-to-door and everything.<eos> Well, you're police, you know.
Could go on a while, Julie said.<eos> Might turn into a bit of a party.<eos> So, shall I put your kids to sleep over here with mine tonight?<eos> Yeah, if you like.<eos> It's not a case of what I like, Karen, It's what you want. They're your kids.
What's up?<eos> My editor's just called to tell me one of the Sundays is running a story.<eos> That's great.<eos> There hasn't been owt all week.<eos> No, it's not the kind of publicity you'd want.
Oh, we've done it!<eos> Come on, Kinchie, let's have it! Hey!<eos> Give it back, cheeky.<eos> Babe, you're the best thing that ever happened on this estate, Julie.<eos> Yeah, well, you stood by me. Never doubted.
Running low on booze, Julie.<eos> Make a run to the offy.<eos> I've some vodka and cans at mine an' all.<eos> I'll go get 'em.<eos> Hey, you, don't run off with that ball!
I'd rather wait until we know the full story.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Have you heard where they found her?<eos> No, not yet.<eos> Nobody I've asked knows. Have you?
Me Dad.<eos> All through me childhood.<eos> For better or worse, I said nowt... and years later he remarried - lass with kids.<eos> I looked at those kids at the wedding reception and I thought -<eos> "You can't risk them going through what you did."
We're calling him Liam.<eos> Has he had his first shit yet?<eos> Hey, shut up, you.<eos> Here have a hold, Mum.<eos> You know me, I'm not sentimental about babies.
I wanted to.<eos> Not every day me best mate becomes a grandma...<eos> We are best mates, aren't we?<eos> Natalie's your best mate.<eos> No, you are now.
No, you are now.<eos> Can't be easy for you, though.<eos> What?<eos> Me prattling on about me new grandson.<eos> And you wi'out your kids.
I know that's what you keep telling everyone.<eos> But if the truth's summat different, we want to know.<eos> There's rumours going round estate, you did know.<eos> They're not true.<eos> There's rumours going round estate, you and Donovan planned it, to get reward money.
I let that pervert Craig near my kids!<eos> We were supposed to be her friends.<eos> I mean, I feel used, don't you?<eos> She's took the piss out of all of us!<eos> And you helped her!
Am I not right?<eos> No.<eos> Look, I just, I want to ask her... "Why?"<eos> Just remember, it were me that stuck me neck out and said what I thought.<eos> You, Julie and t'rest said nowt.
I did.<eos> But you hate her.<eos> No... I don't hate her.<eos> I'm angry with her.<eos> And I could never forgive like you have.
Thanks.<eos> Only being honest, Julie.<eos> Yeah, well, there'd never have been owt for me to forgive if you'd not forced Karen to tell t'truth.<eos> We both did that.<eos> But you were t'one who pushed it.
Do you understand?<eos> I won't let that happen.<eos> Listen. Sid.<eos> I'm not giving up.<eos> And queer or no, you're not, either.
Hey, no, no, no, no.<eos> W-We can do this thing, man.<eos> We can do it.<eos> No! Go now!<eos> Otherwise, you and the kids are dead!
But some of us have a more enlightened view.<eos> Abu Ramal was a great visionary.<eos> You have our sincerest condolences.<eos> What do you want?<eos> The same thing you do, to eliminate the men who killed him.
You might just end up on the terrorist watch list, too.<eos> Vincent, do you copy?<eos> Can't read you.<eos> Good-for-nothing Mexican.<eos> You planned this.
He is my family.<eos> I raised him.<eos> What have you done?<eos> No.<eos> It's what you've done, Sara.
God, these things are disgusting.<eos> What they call 'em again?<eos> Boudin noir.<eos> Not sure what's in them.<eos> I don't think your French is as good as you think it is.
That's why we got someone even more clever.<eos> Thoreau?<eos> Guy's a pencil neck.<eos> A pencil neck with insight into Scofield's plan.<eos> So you, in turn, can be the hammer.
Unless you forgive my brother's debt.<eos> Then our informant won't make the call.<eos> Have your brother fighting your battles, do you?<eos> No.<eos> Why don't you tell your guys to drop the guns, and you and I can have it out?
- You're telling me Mikey's left something encoded in that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, it's encoded in him.<eos> He's got my DNA.<eos> He didn't even know you were coming.
Who's asking?<eos> A man drawn into this by destiny.<eos> Okay. How about you take off?<eos> I don't exactly cotton to strange men coming up to me in the middle of the night, you know?<eos> Only one person calls me Whip... you ain't him.
Leave a message!<eos> God damn it, Christopher.<eos> I told you to change that.<eos> Listen, I was right.<eos> You were wrong.
It's the last pot of the day.<eos> Do you want some?<eos> No. I'm good.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You're too classy for me, too?
"Here"?<eos> Where the hell are you?<eos> I'm in the belly of the beast, man... the basement of Heart Enterprises.<eos> You were right.<eos> You fucking called it.
I'm very sorry, and I promise, I will... I will do anything... Anything you ask me.<eos> - Just... Can you stop? - I know you're the only one who can...<eos> Please.<eos> I can send you a list of recommendations.<eos> You must be Nora.
You don't need to be nervous.<eos> This will be easy.<eos> It doesn't seem easy.<eos> If at any point you're uncomfortable, you can always stop.<eos> You're in control.
Tell Jimmy what?<eos> Lily, I wanna thank you for bringing your mom down.<eos> It was a delight to meet you, young lady.<eos> Thank you, Jimmy.<eos> Tell your friends, even if they already have a will... it's important to get it updated, just like you did.
I used to have a real horror horse.<eos> I spent more time trying to fall off than to ride it.<eos> I did.<eos> It took several years to get a handle on it but once it happened, he was the best jumper I had.<eos> Maybe it's from there you get it.
We can not just sit back and let it happen.<eos> We have to do something.<eos> -No I know. You are right.<eos> We'll think of something.<eos> You're family genius.
Bailey, this is Sebastian.<eos> Sebastian Bailey.<eos> You can call me Thor.<eos> Is that what people call you?<eos> No, but that's what you can call me.
Are you ready to face any new dogs?<eos> Now we go and shop.<eos> See if you click with someone.<eos> The first rule is to spend time with blind, you have to verbalize.<eos> Charlie is not blind, you are, and I did not answer you.
I do not think you can plug it in.<eos> Not directly, but it is retro.<eos> I thought it might help you learn braille.<eos> I've been looking everywhere for one.<eos> Do you use one?
-Well ...<eos> Where I would want her?<eos> Where you would have had the dog.<eos> Inside the house?<eos> She would not do any good if she was there when you were inside.
-Good.<eos> -Apple, Welcome to the family.<eos> I guess she stops.<eos> I love you already.<eos> Do you have an evening routine?
-Okay.<eos> Porridge.<eos> To you and the horse.<eos> Here you are.<eos> And you can eat your here.
I understand that, but it's still the bottom.<eos> Bottom.<eos> You got at least look 15 years.<eos> Yes, but it makes it harder.<eos> You do not know what you're missing.
You think not that I miss to see?<eos> -I guess so.<eos> If you really think I have it easier then you are not as smart as I thought.<eos> Think about it.<eos> When someone says "horse", you know at least how it looks.
I have no idea.<eos> I need to find it.<eos> And I have most probably completely wrong.<eos> When someone says: "The sunset is beautiful"<eos> then you know what a sunset looks.
Errinwright must've covered that, too.<eos> He delivered you to the enemy like a Christmas present.<eos> That motherfucker!<eos> I trained him.<eos> You warned me.
The atmospheric acid levels above the impact site are rising while the temperature is falling.<eos> There's no doubt about it, that crater is active.<eos> And we're fresh out of probes.<eos> This is where you say we have to descend, so we can get close for our sensors to get meaningful readings.<eos> And then you point out that we'd be at the edge of what our ship is rated for, and that our Martian shadow's probably going to shoot at us.
Leave the undersecretary, and you can go.<eos> Say that again.<eos> We have Mao's little racing ship in our other shuttle dock.<eos> Hand over Avasarala for us to keep safe.<eos> You and the Martian can take it and go.
We have Mao's little racing ship in our other shuttle dock.<eos> Hand over Avasarala for us to keep safe.<eos> You and the Martian can take it and go.<eos> Tell him you need assurance of my safety.<eos> I take the Martian and you let us walk out.
I take the Martian and you let us walk out.<eos> Look, we both know how this goes.<eos> Important, powerful people start fighting each other, it's people like us that die.<eos> I've got nothing against you.<eos> You've got nothing against me.
Who beat me on any game?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Really, now?<eos> I don't think you understand I own the arcade.<eos> No, you don't, but I do.
- That's good, kid.<eos> That's how you stay quiet.<eos> He didn't stay quiet, Mikey.<eos> Didn't stay quiet.<eos> Come on, you can do it.
Watch, watch, watch, watch, watch, watch, watch, watch.<eos> Hell, yeah, what would Lizzie do?<eos> She'd be our manager.<eos> Would you manage us?<eos> Why don't you and your little gay friend sit down.
Stop!<eos> I'll shoot.<eos> - Where is it?<eos> - Where's what?<eos> You know why we're here.
I got it, let's go.<eos> Pussy.<eos> That stupid motherfucker.<eos> Your brother's always getting into trouble.<eos> You know he can't control himself, and he always has your attention.
Where the fuck is it?<eos> - I don't have it, man.<eos> - Bullshit!<eos> See if this jogs your goddamned memory.<eos> - You don't understand.
So the fuck what?<eos> The judge said you gotta pay.<eos> He didn't say, "Oh, you gotta pay it this often except for motherfucking Fourth of July."<eos> Yeah, the judge doesn't know about my fucking pension.<eos> I don't get any fucking health, and you know that!
You know, if I could get away with killing you, I would.<eos> That's lovely, honey.<eos> They're gonna ruin dinner.<eos> Get a fucking job.<eos> - You get a fucking job.
- I work.<eos> Yeah, you spread your legs for a fucking living.<eos> Now the baby's crying.<eos> - Fuck you, you're a pig.<eos> - And you're a fucking whore.
Didn't you though?<eos> Yeah, you did owe me some money.<eos> You were supposed to come through on something for me right around the time you quit.<eos> I figured we're even.<eos> Oh, you think we're even, you and I?
He's good.<eos> How come you guys aren't still close?<eos> What do you mean close?<eos> We're brothers.<eos> Well, that's funny because you were practically like a father to that kid, and he hasn't ever done shit for you.
What's this.<eos> Easy, man, that's a stun grenade.<eos> What's he doing with it?<eos> Relax, he wasn't gonna use it.<eos> You gave it to him?
You're really good.<eos> You're better than me.<eos> Please, turn around.<eos> Turn around, what are you gonna fuck me first?<eos> No, you're the fuck-up.
Fuck you!<eos> Mr. Kuchar, we're finished here.<eos> My brother's trying to kill me, man!<eos> You don't even know me.<eos> You and I think the same, Mikey.
You think I'd fuck him over for a payout?<eos> There's no amount of money in this world that I would do that for.<eos> So fuck you, Eddie.<eos> You owe me!<eos> You owe me!
We gotta do this.<eos> Are you sure you're doing the right thing here?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.<eos> Mikey has a tendency to get into trouble, you know that.
Don't you get that?<eos> I owe everything to him.<eos> He didn't have the big brother I had.<eos> What's taking this so long?<eos> You know, you said it would take a couple days.
My cousin's a construction manager.<eos> I'd make you the same return...<eos> Do you know what you're saying to me?<eos> Do you fucking know what you're saying?<eos> You going to prison doesn't do shit for me.
You going to prison doesn't do shit for me.<eos> I don't give a fuck how you get it.<eos> I need that money by tomorrow, or that's exactly where you're going.<eos> You know something, Mikey?<eos> I know something you don't know, and that's that you're lucky.
Because tomorrow when we do the exchange, you get to find out how much your brother really loves you.<eos> - Fuck you, Eddie.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I could probably learn something from you and JP.<eos> You know, how close you are.
Maybe you can offer me some suggestions.<eos> About how to be good brothers.<eos> Sure.<eos> "Dear Buddy, sorry about today,<eos> "but you know you always were the creature "from The War of the Gargantuas when it came to me!
"But you remember when we were partners?<eos> "Had a little car-jacking operation.<eos> "When we were teens.<eos> "Cops were on us one day, we ran.<eos> "You got away, but I got caught.
I got out in three.<eos> "You had promised my share would be waiting.<eos> "Then I got out, there was nobody there... "to pick me up.<eos> "I took a goddamned bus from the prison!<eos> "You had taken my share.
Otherwise the deal's off.<eos> We'll call you back.<eos> I know that JP and I didn't go to church when we were kids, but we didn't know any better.<eos> I know that I'm still alive, for some reason.<eos> So if you, help me get outta this, I promise I will go to church with Lizzie, JP...
- And you're gonna get life.<eos> You can't do shit.<eos> What does he want?<eos> How the fuck should I know?<eos> Just like you can't touch him, he can't touch you.
Fuck you, Eddie.<eos> Uncle Eddie, and there's no reason for that kinda talk.<eos> Didn't your mom teach you boys to speak with distinction?<eos> Now I'm here because a long time ago, your brother and I were friends.<eos> You were never friends.
You used him up.<eos> You fucked the bulk of his life before he had a chance to live it.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Well, I heard about what happened from some cops, who all said to pay that money, the 350 large.<eos> You're worth a lot of money, JP.
What did you say?<eos> Yeah, your junkie niece, what was her name?<eos> Alexis?<eos> I heard she went missing.<eos> You know, with Mikey tied up, you're probably the only thing that girl's got to a father.
What are you doing?<eos> JP, you can't just give it to them, okay?<eos> The cops aren't going to stop them.<eos> Somebody has to.<eos> And you're gonna stop them.
They took Alexis.<eos> You gotta get outta here.<eos> If you gave him that money, they were gonna kill the both of us.<eos> He will hunt us down if we run.<eos> You know that.
Oh, that's very sweet of you.<eos> I'm looking forward to it.<eos> Making anything special?<eos> Oh, no, I'm just grabbing the basics.<eos> I don't cook the way you do.
She mentioned some woman.<eos> - Interesting.<eos> - She didn't say much. And I didn't pry, because I'm never gonna get a straight answer out of her unless she wants to give it.<eos> But she seemed curious.<eos> Do you have any idea why she brought this woman up?
Let me ask you, what do you think Rebecca's take on your relationship is right now?<eos> Well, she'd probably say I'm overbearing, and too judgmental, but I'm her mother.<eos> And no one else is gonna stay up at night and worry like I am.<eos> I want Rebecca to be settled down and happy.<eos> Well, you know, you have a kid.
I want Rebecca to be settled down and happy.<eos> Well, you know, you have a kid.<eos> There's nothing more painful than not being aware of their lifestyle.<eos> It seems that you've been disappointed with Rebecca's choices for a long time now.<eos> Do you think... do you think she started changing with the new job?
Yes... yes.<eos> She started not having enough time for me.<eos> It's really that simple.<eos> But you've heard me say before that relationships aren't singular, right?<eos> Did you contribute at all to Rebecca pushing you away?
I was expecting you at 3:00 p.m.<eos> If you can call the office, please, at 212-555-0168, and we can discuss.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I didn't know if I'd ever see you again.<eos> I think you'd prefer it that way.
And he sells everything, just pills, coke, Fentanyl, and I won't touch that shit 'cause I know it's too addicting.<eos> But it's gonna be hard to get clean if you're always around it.<eos> I don't have anybody else.<eos> I can't count on my mom.<eos> What would you do if you found out your daughter was a fuck-up?
So?<eos> We dated for a little bit, but it's a long and pointless story because I'm not with her anymore.<eos> But, you know, you shouldn't believe everything you hear.<eos> People tell stories that aren't true.<eos> - Do you?
You're a peaceful sleeper.<eos> I like it.<eos> Oh, yeah, I go into, like, a super deep trance zone.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You are not a peaceful sleeper.
What about you?<eos> Older or younger, your siblings?<eos> Oh, both.<eos> I have an older brother, uh, Ken, who's the perfect kid.<eos> - Wait. You're not the perfect child?
- About what?<eos> He was, uh, freaking out at me and accusing me of cheating on him, which I kind of did.<eos> Okay.<eos> But we were basically broken up.<eos> And he was always out of town, and I would never do anything like that anymore because that's not who I am now, with SLAA, and you're nothing like...
What's the worst thing you've ever done?<eos> Seriously?<eos> We're gonna find it out eventually, may as well get it over with.<eos> All right, that makes sense. Yeah.<eos> You go first.
I'm not gonna disappear on you, Gus.<eos> Text me whenever.<eos> I always wanna hear from you.<eos> You're not going to annoy me.<eos> You're not gonna annoy me either.
That I saved you and that your mother deserted you?<eos> - What?<eos> - She left you to die in Idris.<eos> Why would she do that?<eos> Because you're different.
You didn't risk anything for me, you did it for you.<eos> What?<eos> Are you seriously doing this right now?<eos> Right now?<eos> You know damn well I want to find Jace just as much as you do, but that's no excuse to treat me like...
- Oh, no.<eos> Jace.<eos> Aldertree said he wanted to rescue Jace.<eos> Actually, Clary, I said I wanted to find him.<eos> And you gave me the clue I needed to do just that.
First up, all Downworlders are forbidden from entering the Institute without my prior approval.<eos> For those still present, good day.<eos> Mr. Graymark...<eos> I'm not leaving Jocelyn.<eos> Besides, my badge gives access to resources that you don't have.
Right!<eos> Left!<eos> Right!<eos> Impressive, aren't they?<eos> But they still don't have the inherent gifts that you have.
You were right.<eos> When I called off my wedding, that was for me.<eos> But this is all just...<eos> It's very new.<eos> This may surprise you, but you're new for me, too.
- No...<eos> It's ridiculous.<eos> How crazy our lives have gotten in the last few weeks.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You kill demons now.
But unlike them, I'm no longer a threat.<eos> I know my rights.<eos> - Your rights?<eos> - Yeah, my rights.<eos> I might have broken the Accords, but I know you won't.
I will do anything you ask.<eos> Yes.<eos> You will.<eos> This isn't crazy.<eos> You drank blood.
Sometimes feelings evolve, you know?<eos> And the relationship, friendship, whatever it is, needs to change along with it...<eos> Look, Simon, I... Is this because of Maia?<eos> I don't want you to think that we can't still be best friends because you...<eos> Because you're seeing someone.
I don't want to see anyone.<eos> Anyone...<eos> Anyone else, I mean.<eos> I'm in love with you, Clary.<eos> But I realized that you might not feel the same way.
Thank you for going to all this trouble for us.<eos> Thank Magnus.<eos> Magnus!<eos> Aw!<eos> You're new, aren't you?
No, we weren't... We weren't making out.<eos> We were just, I don't know, having a moment.<eos> I cannot believe this is happening.<eos> Look...<eos> Clary, no matter how close we are, you will never understand what it's like to live like this.
What do you say, Max?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Where's your warlock mark?<eos> Max...<eos> You were just as curious at his age.
- I want to talk to you.<eos> There's nothing to talk about.<eos> I think there is.<eos> Max is right.<eos> You're not his brother.
But if I had known you were a demon, I would've done this years ago.<eos> Isabelle, when your mom leaves, disappear for a while.<eos> Bear the pain and get the venom out of your system.<eos> But it feels so good.<eos> - You feel it, too. I know you do, Raphael.
As a parent, your greatest hope is that your children don't inherit your worst traits.<eos> Yeah, well, Max is still young.<eos> Impressionable.<eos> You can still steer that ship straight.<eos> Max says that you and Dad have been fighting.
Everything's different now because of Clary and the Sword.<eos> I can't let my problems interfere with my duty.<eos> Not now.<eos> That's a good girl.<eos> You and Clarissa are going to get along so well.
Jace!<eos> It'll kill you!<eos> He activated it.<eos> You didn't inject me with demon blood, it was angel blood!<eos> You are not my son.
Well, this much is certain.<eos> At this point, your only way to avoid execution is hand over the Cup.<eos> Actually, it's quite the opposite.<eos> See, knowing where the Mortal Cup is... that's the only thing that's keeping me alive.<eos> Valentine, you and I both know, the cup can control demons.
I left.<eos> And I found my way to New York.<eos> You went AWOL?<eos> - I - like to think of it more like a walk about, but um... the good news is, I was successful.<eos> You can be, too.
What do you mean, you copied him?<eos> I memorized everything he did.<eos> And then I did it myself and voil√†!<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sometimes just... knowing that someone else can do something remarkable makes it possible for you to do it too.
How'd it happen?<eos> Not sure, really.<eos> You know, there's a lot of carcinogens in here that I could have been exposed to, bugs...<eos> Simon, I've been a vampire for 60 years.<eos> You've been one for what, two weeks?
Let's do this.<eos> I call upon the power of the Pentagram.<eos> Azazel, I summon thee.<eos> From within our realm, into this mystical confinement, I summon thee.<eos> You seek the Mortal Cup.
I've been seeing him lately.<eos> You... You've been having hallucinations of Leonard Snart?<eos> If you tell anyone, I'll kill you<eos> I believe you.<eos> - You can fix me.
- You're a doctor.<eos> - Of nuclear physics.<eos> - Same thing.<eos> - Mr. Rory, I can't...<eos> You can fix me, but you can't tell anybody about it.
They do.<eos> So before you get in that car and drive back to Modesto, just think about them, okay?<eos> Them, and all the millions of other people that your stories will someday inspire.<eos> The future of the entire world is at stake.<eos> And you're our only hope.
- Excuse me?<eos> It didn't have to end like this.<eos> - Mr. Snart, is he here?<eos> - "Why am I here"?<eos> Why are you here?
"Rip," but I am not.<eos> I take it you two were... pretty tight?<eos> - Yeah, he saved my life.<eos> - Cool. You.<eos> You saved my life.
Well, what would he do, huh? Your Captain, if he were here?<eos> You guys, we... we have to give it them.<eos> - There's no other way.<eos> - There is. You have to become a filmmaker.<eos> You have to make movies, and you, George Lucas, have to believe that.
I think the technical term is nowhere.<eos> All the speedsters the Flash faced are either dead or his friends.<eos> Or people he thought were his friends and are now dead.<eos> Okay, we will figure this out.<eos> And in the meantime, you and Lily keep working with the amulet to figure out to figure out where the rest of the Spear is.
Let's go over this again.<eos> I already been over it, Sara. Mm-hmm, again and again.<eos> And again.<eos> We're obviously dealing with a new player.<eos> Whoever this speedster is, it's someone you and your friends haven't encountered before.
If you'd have listened to me, we would have walked out of that bank instead of being chased out.<eos> Either way, we came out empty-handed.<eos> I seem to remember Eobard mentioning how he was going to punish your failure.<eos> If anyone's a failure, it's you.<eos> You were the one who learned about Hunter's secret account, yet seem not to know about a passcode.
This is a nightmare.<eos> Oh, Lily, I'm so sorry.<eos> This is not how I wanted you to find out. No.<eos> No, I get it.<eos> You didn't want kids when you first came on board this timeship.
It's a little complicated.<eos> A little?<eos> Oh, and for the record, this is how I wanted to approach things in the first place.<eos> Only because you enjoy killing a lot of people.<eos> As if you don't.
Well, I am sorry about that.<eos> No, I'm... I'm the one who's sorry.<eos> For what?<eos> It's not your fault I'm a mistake.<eos> Uh, I've made many mistakes in my life, Lily, but you... most certainly are not one of them.
Thousands will be infected with the virus.<eos> Let Gotham fall so you may rise.<eos> GORDON: I won't have him turn you into a murderer.<eos> No.<eos> You will press it!
We sure that's not the clone?<eos> No, that's Bruce.<eos> God knows what those bastards done to him, but he's only brainwashed.<eos> Are you really the best person to talk to him?<eos> I mean, from what you said, you killed his mentor or something.
So we find her.<eos> And then what?<eos> You blast through her army of goons until you get to Oswald?<eos> You're gonna need muscle, honey.<eos> Which you provide.
And then what?<eos> You blast through her army of goons until you get to Oswald?<eos> You're gonna need muscle, honey.<eos> Which you provide.<eos> Oh, so you expect my help?
You say he was a liar.<eos> How?<eos> By taking away the pain I've carried for years?<eos> By giving me revenge against the people who killed my mother and father?<eos> That's more than you ever did.
So I'll just cook part of him.<eos> (chuckles): Oh, no, my dear.<eos> - Let's be calm.<eos> - You don't have that kind of control.<eos> And you do?
I like it.<eos> It's concentrated.<eos> Once you dilute it, there is enough here to cure every infected person in Gotham.<eos> Hmm.<eos> Oswald, you and I will rule this city together.
He's dead.<eos> He was murdered.<eos> He died.<eos> But he completed his task.<eos> The Court of Owls is destroyed, Gotham burns, and you... are here.
!<eos> Nygma!<eos> How could you let this happen?<eos> Us?<eos> You're the one that trusted him.
Grab Tetch!<eos> BARBARA: Split up.<eos> (singsongy): Jim.<eos> Jim.<eos> You and the ex are infected, huh?
Jim.<eos> You and the ex are infected, huh?<eos> I've heard Lee wants to remove my pretty little head from my body.<eos> Is it weird that kind of makes me like her?<eos> You thinking about ripping anyone's head off, Jim?
(singsongy): You shouldn't have waited.<eos> Well, believe me, if it weren't for Tabby, - you'd have been dead a long time ago. - (chuckles)<eos> You're trying to tell me she had nothing to do with this?<eos> - That's right.<eos> - Oh, so you've just gone behind her back, have you?
You're trying to tell me she had nothing to do with this?<eos> - That's right.<eos> - Oh, so you've just gone behind her back, have you?<eos> I was gonna hit you before we got to the safe house.<eos> Play dumb when you didn't show.
I know you, Ed.<eos> I may be driven by my emotions, but you are driven by something much more predictable:<eos> a desperate, compulsive need to complete what you've started in exacting fashion.<eos> Why didn't you just kill me, Oswald?<eos> You were the one time I let love weaken me, and I want you around as a constant reminder to never make that mistake again.
I want to move up.<eos> Figured this was a good place to start.<eos> I'm at a bit of a crossroads myself.<eos> You hungry?<eos> You buying?
When I have control of all of time, it will be you who is abandoned and forgotten!<eos> And I only need for Iris to die so that you are driven so far into the dark that I can be born.<eos> I'm gonna stop you.<eos> It didn't work.<eos> You lose, Barry!
I'm not a coward.<eos> We just found each other.<eos> I know.<eos> Our story would be brilliant.<eos> You will be brilliant.
Iris didn't die.<eos> So that changes things, right?<eos> I mean, since Iris didn't die, future me never goes down that same dark path.<eos> I never create time remnants to fight Savitar.<eos> And if future you never creates these time remnants, then Savitar himself is never born.
Maybe something that's gonna fix that thin-crust pizza you call a face.<eos> An intradimensional quantum splicer.<eos> A splicer.<eos> I do have a plan B.<eos> I open a time portal, exposing the Speed Force, you shoot me with that, and I become fragmented throughout all of time.
All of us aware and connected through one consciousness.<eos> I'll be everywhere...<eos> every hour, every minute.<eos> And then, I will rule from the Big Bang until the end of the world.<eos> You wanted us to build this thing.
You know what I'm remembering?<eos> Julian just got back to S.T.A.R Labs.<eos> He has the cure.<eos> He can turn her back.<eos> You can have her back. You're so close.
Tracy built the Speed Force trap.<eos> Maybe she has an idea.<eos> Tracy's our best bet.<eos> Am I?<eos> So... you're Savitar.
Sara--she--she had me teleported to the wave rider.<eos> They have this technology that fixed the embolism.<eos> I was there.<eos> Everyone was there.<eos> Nobody saw a white light, and you didn't go anywhere.
My deal with kovar benefits our and in any case, i am pakhan.<eos> My decisions are the law, and I will get obedience from you, even if I have to beat it into you.<eos> Is this why you join Bratva, hmm, to get to kovar, because you had some promise to her, hmm?<eos> You don't have to drop everything and fly home, thea.<eos> I'll still be here when the conference is over, and the way Oliver describes it, you're the one that's doing all at the mayor's office.
If "top gun" here's a maybe, how the hell did I even get on the team?<eos> Don't answer that.<eos> Finding a new black canary isn't just about reviewing resumes.<eos> It's a... it's a feel thing.<eos> Well, I feel like we're busting our asses to find new candidates, and you keep shooting them down.
All that I told you was that chase might have something.<eos> Yeah, yeah, and then I hacked his laptop.<eos> saving dig is gonna break at least 12 federal laws.<eos> Hacking your D.A, Is just small ball.<eos> Plus, you are the mayor.
Costume warehouse having a fire sale I didn't know about?<eos> What do you want?<eos> You're a vigilante and a meta-human, and for the past 3 years, you've been working alone.<eos> We have a proposition for you.<eos> Oh. Sorry. You were doing fine.
So this is gonna help us find miss loco bananas?<eos> Or Sonus.<eos> Either way...<eos> Either way, we're gonna put ourselves in the middle of a showdown between a nutbar and a psycho drug dealer.<eos> When Oliver explained his thinking to us on this, which he rarely ever does by the way, I thought you would be more on board.
What time is it?<eos> 11:40.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Sonus is taking in a major shipment of slide.<eos> And you know where.
These guys aren't exactly known to be friendly.<eos> - OMG!<eos> - O... mg!<eos> The ghost fox Goddess here in meatspace, the real ghost fox Goddess.<eos> You're Kojo Sledgehammer.
I mean, you've been a blank for, well, years.<eos> I've been busy.<eos> - I know.<eos> Palmer tech. - Mm-hmm.<eos> I just figured once you got fired you'd...
It's none of my business.<eos> Ok.<eos> Well, um... heh.<eos> I became a hacker, a hacktivist, because of you, the gfg.<eos> I read about your hack of the department of education, and I was like, "I know what I want to be," but then you just totally stopped and became this, like, information technology support player, and...
You know I'm not.<eos> If we're as alike as you said, we both know you'd kill him.<eos> You're right.<eos> Maybe it's too late for me... And maybe I don't get a second chance...<eos> But you don't have to go down that road.
Rene, the... the guy in the hockey mask, told the other guy that was with us... Curtis...<eos> That this team is all about finding second chances.<eos> You said maybe we don't get second chances.<eos> Well, maybe I was wrong.<eos> Maybe you're my second chance.
You suffer from survivor's guilt.<eos> You can't get over the death of your father.<eos> Adrian Chase has nothing to do with my father.<eos> Kid, when it comes to you, everything has to do with your father.<eos> You and I are not dissimilar.
I didn't ask for you to.<eos> A child doesn't have to ask.<eos> Don't do this, ok?<eos> You may not think of me as your father, Thea...<eos> But you'll always be my daughter.
- This is insane!<eos> - Go!<eos> Go after the rest.<eos> I wouldn't do that if I were you.<eos> Well, you don't seem too bright.
I'm not gonna kill you.<eos> No matter what you do, that is never going to happen.<eos> Never say never.<eos> You said nothing ever really dies?<eos> You're going to.
Even if you had a shot, you've already told me that you wouldn't kill me, or have circumstances finally changed?<eos> If I die, everyone you care about dies except your son, but if you don't kill me, I kill him.<eos> You son of a bitch.<eos> William... Or everyone else.<eos> You choose.
I love you, and...<eos> And I'm coming home, ok?<eos> Ohh! I love you!<eos> Oh, Oliver, I love you so much.<eos> You won.
And I'm coming home, ok?<eos> Ohh! I love you!<eos> Oh, Oliver, I love you so much.<eos> You won.<eos> Your son has his father back, and he learned exactly who his father was just like you learned who your father was right here...
Oh, Oliver, I love you so much.<eos> You won.<eos> Your son has his father back, and he learned exactly who his father was just like you learned who your father was right here...<eos> On these very same waters.<eos> - William's younger than you were, so he's gonna be fine, you know...
You know that, right?<eos> I can't even imagine my life without you and Dolly.<eos> How far do you think you'd go?<eos> How do you mean?<eos> Emotionally, would you... would you fight for me?
It's nice to have a community, though.<eos> It's different to go through life alone, you know?<eos> Yeah, well, I'm just happy you found your voice.<eos> "Dear Jean, I thought a lot about my outburst the other day, about ending therapy.<eos> And what I'm trying to say is maybe you don't see me for who I really am.
It's different to go through life alone, you know?<eos> Yeah, well, I'm just happy you found your voice.<eos> "Dear Jean, I thought a lot about my outburst the other day, about ending therapy.<eos> And what I'm trying to say is maybe you don't see me for who I really am.<eos> You see someone strong and steady, and may not realize that I look in the mirror and see the Cowardly Lion.
I'm so glad you guys made it.<eos> The house looks fantastic, Jean.<eos> And, oh, you look stunning.<eos> Come on outside, everything's set up.<eos> - Did you do all of this yourself?
- Hey!<eos> I can't believe you came all the way out here.<eos> Well, you said it was important, and I couldn't seem to send it all. That's great.<eos> Hey!<eos> - Hey, Jean! - You must be the famous Alexis.
I'm not gonna let them talk like that about her.<eos> I'm obviously gonna want to protect her.<eos> And I don't?<eos> Well, no.<eos> You don't know what it's like. You're always working.
I'm obviously gonna want to protect her.<eos> And I don't?<eos> Well, no.<eos> You don't know what it's like. You're always working.<eos> You don't do the pick-ups. You don't do the drop-offs. You don't deal with those monsters.
I guess it's not enough that you hijacked Dolly's party already today.<eos> Really? What should I have done, Michael, huh?<eos> Just, just pretend like nothing happened?<eos> - Pretend Michelle said nothing?<eos> - Yep. Well, I don't operate like you do. We can't all just live in denial.
You seriously don't get it, do you?<eos> You just think I'm being frivolous.<eos> I don't think you're being frivolous. - I think you're being selfish.<eos> - I want her to feel special today because I know what it feels like to be so fucking invisible all the time.<eos> But you are so far up your own ass that you can't even see it.
But you are so far up your own ass that you can't even see it.<eos> That's really mature.<eos> Why don't you just own up and take responsibility?<eos> Isn't that what you tell your patients?<eos> Oh, fuck off, you don't know the first thing about therapy.
And I just like that he likes being around me.<eos> Mmm-hmm. Yeah. Don't you wish you were with somebody who could take care of themselves?<eos> I mean, so many guys...<eos> What makes you think he can't take care of himself?<eos> So, like, you and Gus are going well, and now you're a relationship expert?
- Oh, yeah.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> She can be intimidating.<eos> Yeah, she's a cunt.<eos> You've only done one season with her.
Um, okay.<eos> I just... I'm a little worried it's a busy day today. The last day of production and all.<eos> So I don't know if I can dig into these, like, right now. But...<eos> - Gus? - Mmm-hmm?<eos> You can do this for me.
Nobody cares what I think.<eos> Hey, I care what you feel, okay?<eos> Don't say that.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> You just want me to work so you have a job.
No, you don't.<eos> You just want me to work so you have a job.<eos> Hey, I could get a job without you, okay?<eos> I just prefer to have a job with you, 'cause you're cool, all right?<eos> But you should do what you want, okay?
Whatever you decide, I'll... I'll support you.<eos> Well, if I don't support my parents, they're gonna go bankrupt.<eos> They're always fighting about money.<eos> Well, your parents can be a little cuckoo, but... if you told them what you just told me, they'd be cool with it.<eos> Or... you could tell them.
Well, if I don't support my parents, they're gonna go bankrupt.<eos> They're always fighting about money.<eos> Well, your parents can be a little cuckoo, but... if you told them what you just told me, they'd be cool with it.<eos> Or... you could tell them.<eos> I don't know, 'cause I kind of feel like if you did it, it'd be a good learning experience.
- What?<eos> - She's not doing Lowlands!<eos> She just said she doesn't want to work. Are you stupid?<eos> The kid says, "I need a break,"<eos> and you come up with that shit?
She just said she doesn't want to work. Are you stupid?<eos> The kid says, "I need a break,"<eos> and you come up with that shit?<eos> You decide to parent for one day - and you think you know what's best?<eos> - Well, because you don't let me near her. Why don't you let me near her?
Shut up!<eos> I don't even know what we're arguing about.<eos> Just tell Sam that I'll do both.<eos> We'll figure something out.<eos> You can come with me to Liberty, and you can come with me to Lowlands.
- Cynthia?<eos> She just posted, like, six pictures on Instagram from the Wizarding World of Harry Potter.<eos> Yeah, she riding' rides, playing Quidditch, drinkin' butterbeer.<eos> Oh, man, hold on.<eos> So you mean she's out there having fun, and you're here stuck doing popcorn?
A lot of people are gonna get fired.<eos> And we are not immune, because those Subzero guys are fucking ruthless.<eos> So smart, strong women like us, we need to stick together.<eos> Yeah, of course. I...<eos> Whatever you say.
It is just very interesting how we choose our words, and how we express those words in order to...<eos> I'm so looking forward to meeting your plus one, if she exists.<eos> Well, she does.<eos> Her name is Patricia, and she's a pretty fuckin' big deal in young adult publishing.<eos> Are you bringing anyone?
We've been here less than 20 minutes, okay?<eos> If I am such an embarrassment, maybe I should just go.<eos> Okay.<eos> Relax.<eos> You enjoy whatever your version of fun is.
- I heard that one where the, um, woman called in about her mother-in-law, who, like, wanted the key to her house...<eos> Oh, God!<eos> What a fucking Oedipal mess that was.<eos> - That was crazy.<eos> - Yeah, well, you really helped her.
If my family sent me a cricket for my birthday, by the time it arrived, it would be dead.<eos> Yeah, I guess. Do the...<eos> Is that a cultural thing?<eos> Like, you send crickets or something?<eos> No, you brought up crickets, and I had brought up the three days, and that was the connection.
Yep. That's, like, such an LA thing.<eos> It's so easy to get just swept up by the city, you know?<eos> Yeah, and I rushed into a relationship with the first guy who asked me out.<eos> I mean, like... yeah, Bertie.<eos> There's, like, ten million people in this city, and you, like, narrow it down to one guy, like, super quick?
And that's one of the things I like about you.<eos> - How perceptive you are.<eos> - So what is it?<eos> What's the big secret here?<eos> - What do you think it is?
Hey, can I just get another one of these, please?<eos> - You got it.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Yeah, I must be hungry or something.<eos> What'd you and Dr. Greg talk about?
Thanks for inviting me, Gus.<eos> Great party.<eos> Hi.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - So... I know what you and Dr. Greg talked about.
Hi.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - So... I know what you and Dr. Greg talked about.<eos> That wasn't my finest hour.<eos> But you and I weren't even dating then, so I don't get why you're mad at me.
