Is he passed out? No.<eos> Empowering.<eos> Yes!<eos> So, you know our golden rule-- we won't sleep together no matter what-- we could just forget it.<eos> The rule.
Really?<eos> Yup. Just for one day.<eos> We just have to swear to each other that we won't get emotionally involved, so I swear.<eos> Okay.<eos> Oh, my.
You should go.<eos> She's not even sure she wants to go through with it.<eos> Go, Zack.<eos> And forget you ever saw me.<eos> Okay, and the dress or the jewelry, ooh, ooh, and this bag, this bag.
That's good.<eos> Hello Mira.<eos> I'm Dr. Ouelet.<eos> Do you remember anything about the attack?<eos> What...
Why can't I feel my body?<eos> Mira, your body was damaged, we couldn't save it.<eos> Only your brain survived.<eos> We made you a new body.<eos> A synthetic shell.
Hanka's running scans.<eos> Dr. Dahlin will have the reports ready but...<eos> I've been talking to the Prime Minister.<eos> He wants a full report.<eos> Togusa.
Just like Osmond.<eos> A message was left at each of the crime scenes by someone identifying himself... as Kuze.<eos> Collaborate with Hanka Robotics and be destroyed.<eos> Collaborate with Hanka Robotics and be destroyed.<eos> Togusa.
What is that?<eos> What is that?<eos> I c-c-can't remember, but I am haunted by it.<eos> Do You see it?<eos> Togusa!
Get away from her!<eos> Get down on the ground now.<eos> Major!<eos> Major!<eos> ...Dozens.
I'll run the standard synaptic.<eos> Upload your data on the raid.<eos> Find out exactly what Kuze told you.<eos> You know what he told me.<eos> The truth.
We have a Section 9 operative under terrorist programming.<eos> This goes public, your unit goes down.<eos> You kill her, you kill us.<eos> I'll take that under advisement.<eos> So what now?
You know how I came up with the idea for the Triple-X program?<eos> Skateboards and swimming pools.
I'm not a soldier, I'm a baller.<eos> My bad.<eos> So, I'll leave you be, then.<eos> Who said there's no such thing as a free meal?<eos> Down on the ground, now!
Down on the ground, now!<eos> Give me the money!<eos> Don't move!<eos> Hurry up!<eos> Goal!
The world is big, but always fits in your heart.<eos> Always have it with you. Now, go, go.<eos> Go, go, go.<eos> Of course, Xander Cage can't pay the satellite company, just like a regular guy.<eos> What?
Running from your problems never works out.<eos> You need a new plan.<eos> I need a new map.<eos> Don't say I didn't warn you.<eos> Oh, boy.
You know, studies have proven that sexual consummation irrevocably ruins nine out of 10 relationships.<eos> Lucky for me, you love to gamble.<eos> Of course not.<eos> My friends, on the other hand, adore stiff odds.<eos> Stiff odds?
Nobody gets in unless you're an X-Game participant! You hear me?<eos> That guy got through.<eos> Hey, get back here!<eos> Wassup, Nyjah?<eos> Lightning-bolt and Burrito.
What are you waiting? Stop the music! Quickly--<eos> Stop it!<eos> Everybody, hands up!<eos> Now!<eos> On the floor!
So, when I stuff you down the toilet, search and rescue will know where to find you between China and North Korea.<eos> Keep talking shit, little man.<eos> Hold that thought, G.I. Joe.<eos> Roll it back.<eos> A little more.
Naked.<eos> - Naked?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> High school.<eos> Oh, no!
Fish in a barrel.<eos> Forty-five U.S.P.<eos> Twelve round mag.<eos> Five left.<eos> Three.
Uh, yeah, I confess, I had my doubts.<eos> That's for talking shit about my friend, Gibbons.<eos> Xiang!<eos> Get on your knees!<eos> On your knees!
Get on your knees!<eos> On your knees!<eos> Hands!<eos> Hands!<eos> On your knees, now.
Pin 'em! Pin 'em down!<eos> Damn! I'm out of bullets.<eos> You got any?<eos> No.<eos> Nothing.
No.<eos> Nothing.<eos> I'm empty.<eos> - We go on three. - Okay.<eos> Wassup?
- We go on three. - Okay.<eos> Wassup?<eos> Rock, paper, scissor, grenade launcher.<eos> Triple-X since 2005.<eos> Thanks for the assist.
The whole world gonna be looking for us.<eos> I wouldn't have it any other way.<eos> We thought we'd end with Augustus' favorite song.<eos> Wow, that's an impressive trick.<eos> What?
But it's now clear that Tuesday's dramatic shoot-out at the FMB is anything but over.<eos> As for the victim, Chris Morrow.<eos> Hey! Listen, you've got to come and get this money out of here and give me that tape. Then just get lost to wherever the hell you guys are getting lost to.<eos> Don't tell me where. I don't want to know.<eos> What?
- You gotta stash it somewhere.<eos> - Where?<eos> Anywhere.<eos> One of the barns around here or something.<eos> Okay, then what?
It's complicated.<eos> Let's just see what we find in Morrow's place.<eos> Mice, I'm guessing.<eos> Or a raccoon.<eos> Maybe a sheep.
- Is that you?<eos> Hurry up!<eos> Hey, I made it!<eos> Is that. Is that what I think it is?<eos> Shit.
You don't have to feel so guilty.<eos> Sometimes, boys just need to be with other boys.<eos> - You all right?<eos> - I'm fine.<eos> - Big day today, huh?
Oh, Jesus fuck!<eos> Whenever you're ready with those digits, Judge.<eos> It's, uh.<eos> Six, three times to the left, 28, four times to the right, 86, three times to the left.<eos> Three times to the left.
That's how it starts, and then the next thing you know, little Wendys running all around your house.<eos> I don't know, I don't know.<eos> - 602. - 602. - Not 206.<eos> - All right.<eos> What?
Yeah, no shit.<eos> They fucking love 'em.<eos> We had some pretty good times back in the day.<eos> You and me.<eos> But now, 'cause of tonight.
Trust me, I'll be fine.<eos> He says it was Ed Burton for sure.<eos> He couldn't make out any other faces.<eos> He did say they sped off in a blue Caddy.<eos> What?
I'm Francie Millner's first nanny,<eos> Jo Flanagan.<eos> That's Jo with a "J" and an "O" and no<eos> I'm Renzo.<eos> With an "E" and an "O" and no
Walter, where do you live?<eos> Today will not suck.<eos> Your nails are orange and your hair is orange. And your dress is orange.<eos> I say it's too much orange.<eos> Too much orange?
The Kepps.<eos> - Bina and Jerry Kepp.<eos> - Right.<eos> And I'm Walter, just a successful businessman who just likes to read his favorite book.<eos> That one.
Yeah, I mean... You should be traveling the world. Hmm.<eos> I've never actually been outside the country.<eos> It almost happened after high school but I had to get a job answering phones at a car dealership and my supposed friends couldn't wait.<eos> So now I find myself thinking that this guy... You, guy... seem like the kind of person who, in fact, did not have to get a job at Lukazey's Toyota and has been to Europe or some such and knows where one goes to...<eos> To what?
Mom, you could never make a fool of yourself.<eos> You couldn't make it. Not possible.<eos> - What are we doing?<eos> - We're dancing.<eos> And also?
It's a little too much.<eos> You know, this isn't really dancing. Oh?<eos> This is dancing.<eos> Watch it!<eos> What?
Save me, please.<eos> I don't know what I'm saying anymore.<eos> Maid of honor toast time!<eos> Let's go.<eos> What?
We don't, because we don't know anything about her.<eos> She's temperamental.<eos> She hasn't had a drink and now she's puked up mini hotdogs.<eos> Do none of you care that that girl is obviously pregnant?<eos> What? Huh?
Did you just break another chair?<eos> What kind of nanny are you?<eos> Retired.<eos> Wow, the last time Jerry and I did this was the last time Jerry and I had sex.<eos> Three... Actually, over three years ago.
Well, then you saved a life. No.<eos> Because it turned out she wasn't as sick as we thought.<eos> On account of the fact she didn't exist.<eos> I don't think he'd ever been married.<eos> What?
And not just on his face.<eos> But, yeah, otherwise, I'm all fine so just let me know when you want to start the intercourse.<eos> What?<eos> What?<eos> What?
What?<eos> What?<eos> What?<eos> Sorry, why am I here?<eos> Not that.
Even if it's something very private?<eos> My understanding of women seems poor right now.<eos> I'd say go with your gut.<eos> Francie doesn't even remember me, does she?<eos> Ah, those rotten kids.
We hope it all works out for you. It'd be great if it did.<eos> Cousin Walter? I'm glad you could come.<eos> Thank you for inviting me.<eos> It was simply amazing.<eos> Truly wonderful day.
Perfect, thank you.<eos> The baby is a...<eos> Wait, what baby?<eos> It's a great screwup! It's this perfect screwup!<eos> What?
I'm the same.<eos> No, I'm the same.<eos> No, not really. The Bina I married would never cheat on me.<eos> Well, the Jerry I married...<eos> What?
No, I'm the same.<eos> No, not really. The Bina I married would never cheat on me.<eos> Well, the Jerry I married...<eos> What?<eos> What?
I would like herbal tea, please.<eos> Okay, I'll get you an herbal tea.<eos> - Did you guys get menus?<eos> - No, but we'd like some. - Claire.<eos> - What?
- How old your boy?<eos> - Six.<eos> He obviously likes to hide.<eos> Marco.<eos> Oh, no.
Please, don't hurt him!<eos> I promise I'm gonna be back.<eos> I'm gonna come right back, sweetheart.<eos> I'm gonna have to let them take you.<eos> Just for a minute, okay?
He has a red baseball cap with blonde hair sticking out of it.<eos> And he has on like a gray or blue, some kind of work uniform, I don't know.<eos> Wait a minute. - Is nobody here with you?<eos> - No, ma'am. But we can have a hundred cars looking for them in an hour, okay?<eos> - An hour? Oh my God, in an hour?
And do you remain in contact with these people?<eos> When a child recovers, the family... will generally choose to forget.<eos> You've no degree. But they say you've a gift.<eos> My skill comes through experience, and a certain, um, sensitivity.<eos> Sensitivity.
Ja...<eos> Jakob.<eos> Jakob, what is it?<eos> Jakob.<eos> - Ah! - What?
Buongiorno.<eos> Signore.<eos> There's a story about that cat.<eos> It was the custom amongst those building houses such as this to... to seal a cat within the walls as a protection against evil.<eos> - A dead cat? - No.
He's waiting.<eos> But he's waited long enough.<eos> Surely that is clear to anyone.<eos> When he speaks... where will you go?<eos> To the next place.
Your left leg forward.<eos> Your hand.<eos> Yes, your hand.<eos> Your head.<eos> This way, yes.
Your hand.<eos> Yes, your hand.<eos> Your head.<eos> This way, yes.<eos> Just a little more.
She tossed it right after class.<eos> She really should appreciate it more.<eos> It's probably the only rose she'll ever get.<eos> Maybe it had something to do with the card.<eos> "Maybe next year, but probably not."
Go back to the ward.<eos> Go home.<eos> Get off me! Get off me!<eos> Who are you?<eos> Psycho!
Get off me! Get off me!<eos> Who are you?<eos> Psycho!<eos> Get this bitch on a leash!<eos> Psycho!
What happened last night?<eos> Sorry.<eos> I was FaceTiming with Patrick till, like, 3:00.<eos> Speaking of which, are you nervous for tonight?<eos> What?
No, no, no, no!<eos> Sorry! I'm sorry!<eos> I'm sorry! Don't. Don't do that.<eos> I'm gonna go find Patrick, okay?<eos> What?
I've been looking everywhere for you.<eos> Yeah? In Patrick's mouth, maybe.<eos> You seem a little guilty.<eos> Were you with Rob, you hussy?<eos> Skank.
Get off me!<eos> Freak, get out of here!<eos> Get the fuck out!<eos> Get this bitch on a leash!<eos> Psycho!
I took mine.<eos> Well, I know something that'll cheer you right up.<eos> I swear to God, Elody, if you hand me a condom right now...<eos> But it's your present.<eos> For your special night.
Sisyphus.<eos> Why is our friend Sisyphus still relevant today?<eos> Why is the story still relevant today?<eos> Get this bitch out of here!<eos> Psycho!
Psycho!<eos> What the hell? Shit.<eos> What are you doing in here?<eos> This is my bathroom.<eos> Nice shoes.
I mean, this whole high school thing's just a blip.<eos> I'm not gonna remember any of you.<eos> I win.<eos> Do you ever feel like you're living the same day over and over again with only, like, a few things being different?<eos> Oh, shit, Samantha.
You're the one always criticizing people and hurting people.<eos> You're the one who lied about being friends with her and then tortured her for all these years.<eos> I just followed along and yet... I'm the one paying for it.<eos> Sam, what are you talking about?<eos> What?
Juliet...<eos> Please let me help you.<eos> It doesn't matter now.<eos> It's like your Val-a-gram always said...<eos> "Maybe next year, but..." "Probably not."
Sociopath, 12 o'clock.<eos> Does it smell like pee in here?<eos> Stop.<eos> Norma Bates!<eos> What?
She has a name and she is a person.<eos> Yesterday, you said you were afraid she would bite you if she got too close.<eos> That was a long time ago.<eos> That was yesterday.<eos> Hey, Linds.
An exquisite creature.<eos> A great desecration for me.<eos> But I have to say, her cubs did survive.<eos> They thrived, and have grown to a proud maturity in my zoo.<eos> Cheers.
Meat, firewood,<eos> - soap... - No.<eos> No.<eos> It can't be true.<eos> The animals?
Don't you see?<eos> He's Hitler's head zoologist.<eos> Lutz Heck controls our zoo.<eos> My God!<eos> - Beautiful.
Where are your shoes?<eos> I must have left them in the pen.<eos> Well, put them on, please.<eos> You're not a child.<eos> Upstairs!
We have to work with him, we agreed.<eos> It was the only way to do this.<eos> I never agreed to this.<eos> Never.<eos> - To what?
Antonina.<eos> - Mrs. Anzelowna?<eos> - Yes? And your mother?<eos> Out. Come out.<eos> Here, down on your knees.

Todigforanswers.<eos> Justletme in there.<eos> Um,wheream I?<eos> So what else do you have?<eos> -Uh, this one here. -Oh.

Wow. You've got it all planned out, huh?<eos> Yes, indeed.<eos> -That's a good plan. -Mm-hmm.<eos> Right, Bailey?<eos> What?

Good one.<eos> All right.<eos> You go play, all right?<eos> Gotta get back.<eos> What?
What?<eos> I'm sorry, what?<eos> What's your line?<eos> Your job.<eos> J-O-B?
Yeah, everything was fine all that time until he just up and says...<eos> "I'm into dudes," you know?<eos> I'm done with her.<eos> I just need to move on, find somebody new.<eos> Not you necessarily, but...
You're totally out of your mind, man.<eos> If you had had the baby, it would have forced us to grow up.<eos> You know?<eos> I did have the baby.<eos> What?
Any kids?<eos> Yeah.<eos> How old?<eos> They're six and fifteen.<eos> Why?
Claire?<eos> Hey, Dad.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Okay!<eos> Okay, bye.
Fucking Polly, man.<eos> Why can't she leave me alone?<eos> Delete.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> What?
Why can't she leave me alone?<eos> Delete.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> What?<eos> What?
Coop!<eos> Why Golf Matters.<eos> I feel like I'm doing fieldwork among the natives or something.<eos> We shouldn't have come here.<eos> What?
To see a stranger's eyes tear at the memory of a similar pet is to know the inherent goodness of your kind.<eos> You...<eos> Urinated.<eos> Urinated... on my address book and chewed up two sofas...<eos> Three.
No.<eos> Look, he has no interest in talking to you, and we'd... just prefer if you don't call this number anymore, okay?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Who the hell was that?<eos> Wow.
No woman's ever handled my Herschel!<eos> Clear a path!<eos> No, no, no!<eos> Stop, stop, stop!<eos> Hard a-starboard!
No, it can't be.<eos> I've spent years searching for this?<eos> The great Jack Sparrow is not some drunk in a cell.<eos> Do you even have a ship? A crew?<eos> Pants?
C'mere, you pirate scum!<eos> Hey!<eos> What you doin'?<eos> No, no, no, no!<eos> Horses?
Do you hear that?<eos> The pirate wishes to be cordial.<eos> So let me show you what my cordiality is, hombre.<eos> Every time I tap my sword. One of your men will die, so I suggest you speak quickly.<eos> Oye ahí!
Hey, Jack Sparrow.<eos> Jack 'Esparrow'.<eos> Spanish?<eos> No, no...<eos> Ghosts!
Jack 'Esparrow'.<eos> Spanish?<eos> No, no...<eos> Ghosts!<eos> Ohh...
The unscratchable itch?<eos> Scabies, I'm talking about scabies.<eos> Small mites that burrow under the skin.<eos> Certainly annoying me, has done, for years.<eos> Oh, no!
Get the anchor up, quick!<eos> Stop, stop.<eos> Bring it up, bring it up!<eos> Capitán, Capitán!<eos> Oh, crap!
- What?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Are they gonna take the apartment away?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - What about the houses?
Bernie: I met Ruth when she was 13.<eos> I was 16. A friend was having a party in his basement<eos> Something had happened to the jukebox. It got knocked around when he was moving it, so the only song it'd play was "Sh-Boom" over and over.<eos> She was this tiny, little blonde with enormous blue eyes.<eos> Just gorgeous.
You? I've been better.<eos> I'll bet.<eos> - Mommy, Mommy.<eos> - What? - Is that Ruth Madoff?<eos> - Jessica, not another word.
No, I understand.<eos> And I can't talk to you anymore.<eos> You can't write to me or call me.<eos> It'll be too hard. Ruth, all I want is what's best for you and for the boys.<eos> Boy, Bernie.
- Aaron.<eos> - Steele?<eos> - Your old boss, huh?<eos> - Yes.<eos> For what?
Bill can still see some shapes and light but he won't be able to discern any waving or pointing.<eos> No gesticulation.<eos> I'll take two.<eos> I'll take one.<eos> Flush, jack high.
Thank you, my beautiful wife is here.<eos> - Hello, Arnold.<eos> - Mrs. Dutchman.<eos> - Hey, baby.<eos> Any progress?
Okay, then... you two have a good time.<eos> Where were we?<eos> "God to a city in love with water."<eos> It was just really, really hot in there today.<eos> What?
I don't even know if I know who I am.<eos> Well, I know who you are and I think you're fucking fabulous.<eos> That's real.<eos> Do you think Mark's a good guy?<eos> What?
- Well, you know her.<eos> You mean Ella?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Forget it.<eos> - What?
Suzanne Dutchman.<eos> What's up, homes?<eos> What's the matter?<eos> You got ass-burgers?<eos> - What?
It certainly wasn't the worst I've ever read.<eos> You... know what this means, don't you?<eos> - No, what does this mean?<eos> - You must have dinner with me tonight.<eos> What?
No kids?<eos> No, I I realized that I couldn't be a good father and good writer, so no kids.<eos> - We tried for a long time, but it didn't work.<eos> Here you are.<eos> Straight, 12 o'clock.
Michelle, this cannot come as a surprise to you but I want a...<eos> What's going on here?<eos> I lost something.<eos> I took it.<eos> What?
There will be no more killings.<eos> There will be no more purges. Am I clear, brother?<eos> Now leave me.<eos> Peace?<eos> For a while.
Well, they get treated the same as the man they hide.<eos> Would they, now?<eos> Not sure you're too welcome here, mate.<eos> You're in safe hands now, no need to worry.<eos> In the back room, now.
It's first thing in the morning, Mike.<eos> - Did he pay?<eos> - 'Course he paid. He's a good boy, that Mike.<eos> Buy some lessons in street etiquette with the change.<eos> - Change?
I thought we agreed that you'd never come here.<eos> You need to hear this.<eos> Vortigern is making a visit to Londinium to meet with the barons. - He will travel by barge.<eos> - When?<eos> - Three days from now.
George, will you tell them?<eos> Sorry, boss.<eos> Weapons!<eos> You silly bastards. Determined to die.<eos> Shit. On my command!
Shall I pick him up, Sarge?<eos> No, follow him.<eos> The blood he followed was from a man who killed one of my sergeants today.<eos> A man who fled the scene of an assassination attempt on me.<eos> On me, no less.
You going for a swim, Melissa?<eos> This is the Doctor.<eos> Have a party for him every year.<eos> Celebrate.<eos> To the Doctor.
This is the Doctor.<eos> Have a party for him every year.<eos> Celebrate.<eos> To the Doctor.<eos> Eternity.
What's that for'?<eos> "X" marks the spot.<eos> I love your soul.<eos> Go, "Ah."<eos> Oh, no.
Where do you get a jacket like this?<eos> Makes you walk different.<eos> Get you a hundred jackets like that.<eos> How long you lived here?<eos> About two weeks.
Why is he after you if he's not attracted to you?<eos> Did you ever sleep with him?<eos> Yes.<eos> You did?<eos> Once.
- You ready?<eos> You gotta try harder than that.<eos> I wish I could take back every wound.<eos> Guess that blue bug is back.<eos> Every doubt.
You supposed to let me know what's going on.<eos> Why the hell you care?<eos> Because it's my business to care.<eos> Well, he's moving in next week.<eos> No, no.
You know, the...<eos> With the girl.<eos> The girl...<eos> The girl he always with.<eos> The girl...
Got his son back.<eos> I expect this will all be wrapped up momentarily.<eos> What are you doing here, Stanley?<eos> You have a job.<eos> A good one.
I'm off the books.<eos> I've been working undercover for two years...<eos> Two fuckin' years!<eos> You know what that means?<eos> Two fuckin' years!
This ain't yours.<eos> It's Cass's.<eos> Put it on voicemail.<eos> Okay.<eos> What a night.
Put it on voicemail.<eos> Okay.<eos> What a night.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What a night.
BP is thready.<eos> Looks like she's losing consciousness.<eos> Five's clear.<eos> Come on, hon. Stay with me.<eos> Hard right.
I'm not supposed to say that.<eos> No, no, you're just being honest.<eos> Yeah, I haven't been doing this very long.<eos> Actually, you're my first.<eos> - Your first, what?
It's Pablo, actually.<eos> But I like Paul better.<eos> Listen we have seen each other, what, three times now? But every single time, it's bad news.<eos> I can't tonight.<eos> But how about Saturday?
- What do you do?<eos> - I'm a writer.<eos> - Really? - Yeah.<eos> Books?<eos> Yeah, books, yeah, long time ago.
- Good morning. - Good morning.<eos> - The water is freezing. - Yeah, it is.<eos> Makes you feel alive.<eos> Could just pinch yourself.<eos> Thanks for breakfast.
Get up! - Okay, alright!<eos> Come here, come here. - Get in the trunk!<eos> - Get that window, that window!<eos> - Get in! Move, move!<eos> - Shit.
We're gonna... hey, listen.<eos> We're going to get out of here.<eos> - We can't just sit here. - Hold on, hold on, hold on.<eos> You hear that?<eos> What?
Hang on.<eos> It was, the most amazing thing that's ever happened.<eos> So Mr. Stark's like: "Hey, Underoos!"<eos> And I just sort of flipped in, and I stole Cap's shield, and I was like, "Hey, what's up, everybody?"<eos> Hey, just a second.
- It's my car, dumbass!<eos> - Hey!<eos> Shut that off!<eos> - I was just trying to---<eos> - Yo!
- What are you doing?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You good?<eos> Chess?
I don't know, evil lair?<eos> - Evil lair?<eos> - Dude, a gang with alien guns run by a guy with wings,<eos> - yeah, they have a lair.<eos> - Badass.
Alright, Happy.<eos> Enjoy tracking this lamp.<eos> There's a ton of other subsystems in here.<eos> But they're all disabled by the... "Training Wheels Protocol".<eos> What?
- No, no.<eos> Yeah, push it.<eos> - What was that?<eos> - Taser webs.<eos> Taser webs?
- What about KAREN?<eos> - You can call me KAREN if you'd like.<eos> Hey, KAREN.<eos> What else can this suit do?<eos> What?
Thanks, KAREN.<eos> It's really nice to have somebody to talk to.<eos> - Hey, how long have we been here, anyway?<eos> - 37 minutes.<eos> What?
There's a vehicle approaching on your right.<eos> We have now entered sudden death.<eos> The next correct answer wins the championship.<eos> - Midtown Tech?<eos> - Zero.
- Yes, Peter.<eos> - I record everything you see.<eos> - Everything?<eos> - Everything.<eos> - Like, all the time?
And now, we're on Iron Man's radar?<eos> Yeah, I'm running.<eos> - You should, too.<eos> - You know I can't do that.<eos> - So now, what?

Oh, my god!<eos> Capoeira! Capoeira!
I don't know if you remember me telling you this but Barb was in the special ops.<eos> So she's highly trained for this type of situation.<eos> Let me tell you a story about Barb.<eos> We really need... 1991, Kuwait.<eos> Hot as fuck...
You took someone from my family.<eos> I must take someone from yours.<eos> That is the way it is.<eos> I didn't make the rules.<eos> Not this one.
I'm gonna distract them!<eos> You're distracting them?<eos> My son!<eos> My son! My only son!<eos> What?
Although, one could say that the way that store was managed, that was the real jungle.<eos> And then, well, my doctor said I was sick. So, I said to myself, "Roger! What the heck?"<eos> Oh, god. Are you ill?<eos> Hmm? Yes, ma'am. Caught the travel bug.<eos> Oh, the travel bug.
Yeah, and you know what? When I just say anything just remotely critical...<eos> Wait! "Remotely critical"?<eos> Mom, you flat-out insult me.<eos> All the time.<eos> What?
When we look into the worm's eyes, Linda.<eos> Come outside and face me.<eos> Yes. Show me your face.<eos> Oh, here it comes.<eos> Oh. What?
Hi, maco.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Emily, this is a traditional gift that the village made for you.<eos> It's for protection while you're here.<eos> For me?
Hi!<eos> No! Now, I'm gonna kill you.<eos> Don't touch my daughter!<eos> Don't move!<eos> Now what?
I missed you.<eos> Oh, my god! I'm so happy to see you.<eos> I left the house.<eos> I made all these men come...<eos> What? Oh!
He's a real bummer.<eos> Oh, yeah. The worst.<eos> Yep. Awful. Full agreement.<eos> Morgan. Morgan!<eos> What?
I wanna go home so fucking bad.<eos> I'm so hungry. I'm so hungry.<eos> Let's get the fuck out of here!<eos> Can I have just whatever everyone is drinking?<eos> Just, like, your signature thing.
Oh, like this place?<eos> I wonder what the rooms are like.<eos> Tiny bathrooms and musty carpet.<eos> If you're feeling better, we should really get going.<eos> What?
Our ego depends on guilt for its survival as it allows us to separate the world into different objects which we then call "good" and "evil."<eos> There is no good and evil.<eos> There is only perfection.<eos> Father, I'm gonna thank you for your son Jesus who died on the cross for me.<eos> For my sins, not only for my sins, but for my fears.
- You don't even exist.<eos> You're only good for one thing, and you know it.<eos> So just do it.<eos> Just hit me.<eos> What?
We are gonna die because of you!<eos> Just let me think!<eos> Think about what? Think about what?<eos> I'm thinking...<eos> What?
Meanwhile, these fanatical insurgents trying to erase 5,000 years of history unwillingly cover your tracks.<eos> It's a pretty good scam.<eos> Sergeant Morton!<eos> Where is it?<eos> What?
Do you have any idea what this is?<eos> The significance of it?<eos> An Egyptian sarcophagus in a tomb in Mesopotamia.<eos> Why just say "15 seconds"?<eos> What of what?
- You murdered him.<eos> And you shot me. You tried to kill me.<eos> You even went after Jenny.<eos> You shot me.<eos> Three times.
Yes it is.<eos> No it isn't.<eos> The main crash site it's up that way and so is my artifact.<eos> And that's where we are going.<eos> What the hell?
Jenny?<eos> Nick?<eos> Ok.<eos> Ok.<eos> What?
Ok.<eos> What?<eos> GOD OF DEATH...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> What?
Embalming her with mercury.<eos> At -38 degrees the mercury in her veins will solidify and she should be safe for dissection then.<eos> Dissection?<eos> You said that we'd study her.<eos> Yes, by dissection.
Nick, wake up.<eos> Wake up.<eos> They will kill you just as they killed my chosen before you.<eos> It burns.<eos> What?
Stop it!<eos> Stop!<eos> Stop it!<eos> Stop!<eos> Fascinating.
Come here.<eos> I do enjoy the garments of pain.<eos> Well done, Mr. Morton. Well done.<eos> Come on. We have to destroy the stone.<eos> What?
This is the moment, Nick.<eos> This is the moment!<eos> Yes, you are damn right.<eos> I'm gonna taking that stone, Deliver you to Ahmanet and then my work here is done.<eos> What?
He gave his life to save me.<eos> To bring me back.<eos> Yes, Jennifer.<eos> He found his redemption.<eos> But at great cost.
Stay away!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Wonder Woman! Save me! Save me from them!<eos> - From whom?<eos> - Demons.
- Have you talked to him lately?<eos> I know he's pissed. You don't have to remind me, love.<eos> - It's on my CV, remember?<eos> - No, really, has he told you...<eos> No.
I'll make sure the looky-loos stay out of our hair.<eos> Z, give me a psychic shout if this body comes under attack.<eos> Wouldn't do to be trapped inside, now.<eos> Wouldn't do to go in alone, and since I'm right here...<eos> Too dangerous.
John.<eos> Come on, fellow. Eat a piece of fruit?<eos> Here it is.<eos> We've got to get out of here.<eos> One more second.
Make sure he sees that right when he wakes up.<eos> If he wakes.<eos> We need to talk, you and I, but if you try and summon Etrigan,<eos> I'll fill your lungs with bile before the first verse is done.<eos> Savvy?
Then tell us why you were there.<eos> Richard is known as a collector of the arcane and supernatural.<eos> I wanted to see if he had something that could gain me access to this place.<eos> Why would you wanna break in here?<eos> For this.
Do you see why I can't do what you do?<eos> You lost control is all.<eos> Happens to the best of us.<eos> You've seen me in action, right?<eos> Yeah, once or twice.
I say we go and talk to a man about a horse.<eos> Did you hit your head or something? You're babbling.<eos> A Trojan horse, Boston.<eos> Come on!<eos> Over here, you wanker!
- Give me your wallet.<eos> Well, I have...<eos> I have...<eos> I have many cards here, we agreed?<eos> Liquid money.
- Awesome!<eos> In fact, I suspect the reason was mold.<eos> Well, your night is wet.<eos> "Joe".<eos> What?
This is not a confession of guilt!<eos> I'm just tired.<eos> We must get rid of some weight.<eos> Get rid of the damn pork pudding.<eos> What?
Do you know my opinion?<eos> I think we owe ourselves To live every day we have.<eos> I feel I really want Get to know you more.<eos> I share a meal with you.<eos> What?
Well, after three seconds, I will shoot you.<eos> What?<eos> I will respond to you by shooting!<eos> Is this your plan?<eos> One!
I'll get the champagne then.<eos> No more wine for you.<eos> Prove your place, you can not bear wine.<eos> The reason is not wine.<eos> What?
No more wine for you.<eos> Prove your place, you can not bear wine.<eos> The reason is not wine.<eos> What?<eos> Hey, why not wine?
As I do every day.<eos> It's a fairly new relationship, So we spend a lot of time together.<eos> Lennar, in the early morning, We practiced love twice.<eos> No.<eos> Three times.
- What do you mean? Like delivery boys?<eos> - That, and we're giving you some capital to get the locals working with the engineers on the pumping station.<eos> Look, lieutenant, everybody's been talking about going home.<eos> And now you want us to go to some place we don't control.<eos> For what? A photo op?
Hey, why do you paint her green?<eos> Strays around here, wild and pissed off. People shoot 'em on sight.<eos> Green dog, that's a good dog.<eos> Anyone shoots a green dog, they answer to me.<eos> Any tips?

Funny thing, we were in the wrong place... just watching a civilian's house.<eos> So if I can do that... you can stay in that trunk.<eos> Okay, no more talking now.<eos> Whoa.<eos> Again.
If Metzger's already taken care of our main problem, we can forget about the girl.<eos> I finish what I start.<eos> And when we find the girl, we find Lucas.<eos> We've got other problems besides the girl, Richard.<eos> Like what?
Ella, listen to me very carefully. He's a professional assassin.<eos> We believe he's been hired to kill you.<eos> Were going to trace this number, Ella, and we're going to get help to you right away.<eos> Ella... are you there?<eos> Yeah, just a second.
Ella, hello. I'm here to take you home.<eos> Seat belt?<eos> The only reason you're still alive is to give Addison a message.<eos> Tell him I'm done. He won't see me again.<eos> So now what?
My best friend.<eos> Actually, only friend who's never left us.<eos> What is this?<eos> - This is for you.<eos> - What?
What did you think I was gonna do with £4,000, Mark?<eos> I was a fucking junkie!<eos> Aye, suppose you were.<eos> I still am!<eos> Fuck's sake.
So, what you been up to for 20 years?<eos> I've been in Amsterdam.<eos> - Nice.<eos> - All right.<eos> What else?
Where is she?<eos> None of your business.<eos> Saved your life, though.<eos> This is for you.<eos> Fuck's sake.
Couple of bags of H. Good quality stuff.<eos> We took it to London.<eos> Me, him, Begbie, Spud Murphy.<eos> Sold it.<eos> Not a bad price.
You and me, son.<eos> You and me.<eos> We're gonna go out there and do a bit of business together.<eos> I've enrolled in college, Dad.<eos> - What?
These are partitions.<eos> Eight rooms. Sixteen girls. Two shifts.<eos> We could be turning over £10,000 a week every week of the year.<eos> - So, where's my office?<eos> - What?
- Mine too.<eos> Okay.<eos> You remember shoplifting in Woolworths together and you got caught, you gave my name?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - How about this one?
You just came back to tell me that?<eos> Of course, any misfortune which befalls you is music to my ears.<eos> I was supposed to go back and move my stuff out.<eos> She owns the apartment.<eos> - And the children?

- Welcome to the new age of - civil rights, space exploration. - You know what happened in 1974?<eos> The first McDonald's in the UK. He's basically John Barry with football boots.<eos> See, look at that guy.<eos> He would be scrawny today.<eos> A great, swaggering, filthy piece of music. But then...
I'm... no-not guilty.<eos> Fine.<eos> Off the record, the police have told me that the USB drive does have Simon's prints on it and that in searching the flat, they found the mobile that the bank details were sent from.<eos> Right.<eos> As well as the cocaine, of course.
You could've got someone cheaper.<eos> Well, I wouldn't have had to get anyone at all if you hadn't engaged in fucking blackmail.<eos> Is there anything left of your £4,000 I gave you?<eos> No, I've got expenses, just like everyone else.<eos> What, all of it?
- There he is.<eos> - Holy fucking moly.<eos> Hasn't changed in 20 years.<eos> Very same smug, little Cunty grin across his ugly face.<eos> - For fuck's sake! - Aye, Renton.
You most definitely fucking will.<eos> Simon and I do not sleep together.<eos> No?<eos> I had wondered.<eos> Once, but...
More than he likes himself, I think.<eos> Right, but if you're not...<eos> If there's no physical aspect to your relationship, I mean, you don't want to be, like... You know, wasting your time.<eos> What's "choose life"?<eos> - What?
- All set?<eos> - Yeah, fine.<eos> You're okay? - Aye.<eos> - Sure?<eos> - Why?
Because her father, someone who should have been looking after her, protecting his own infant, was too busy filling his own veins with heroin to check that she was breathing properly.<eos> How do you keep a lid on that one?<eos> Well, that's that, then.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Fuck's sake.
- No, I didn't get a fucking e-mail.<eos> We got the money.<eos> - What?<eos> - How much?<eos> The money.

A long time ago, there was an Indian princess.<eos> What did she look like?<eos> Well, she was very pretty.<eos> What color was her hair?<eos> Like this.
- We gotta go.<eos> Okay. Okay.<eos> Hey, Mack. We're just sitting down for dinner.<eos> - What the heck is this?<eos> - What?
You've seen the weather out, right?<eos> - It's only two streets away.<eos> - Another time.<eos> Hey, you.<eos> What?
I mean, what if it is that guy?<eos> And then he's trying to get you out there for who knows what reason.<eos> We don't know that yet.<eos> You already think about the other possibility?<eos> What?
Don't you get mad at 'em?<eos> Well, sure.<eos> But what parent doesn't?<eos> And that's when your whole wrath thing comes in, right?<eos> My what?
Breathe.<eos> Good, Mack.<eos> I'm not going anywhere.<eos> Now, let's get you out of this boat.<eos> - What?
Looks like we've got company.<eos> Look at this.<eos> Look!<eos> See him?<eos> What a beauty!

He's focused on you.<eos> Is that...<eos> Dad.<eos> Mack, I'm so sorry.<eos> For everything.
- What he did...<eos> - Was horrible.<eos> I'm not asking you to excuse what he did.<eos> I'm asking you to trust me to do what's right and to know what's best.<eos> And then what?
Absolutely.<eos> Mack, you are important.<eos> And so is everything you do.<eos> Every time you love, Mack, or forgive, with every act of kindness, the universe changes.<eos> For the better.
Hey.<eos> Oh.<eos> Oh, you're okay.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> About everything.
No, I'm gonna go back to the room.<eos> I told Stuart I'd give him a call.<eos> - Bring me a drink back.<eos> Thank you. - Yeah, you wish.<eos> Nice ass.
Kind of, more or less.<eos> And then I thought if I came on this trip and I came away with you, and I had fun and I showed that I could be fun, somehow he would come back, but...<eos> Come on.<eos> - What? - Come on, we have to get dressed.<eos> - For what?
Oh. I know you're clumsy, so don't fall in, okay?<eos> There she is.<eos> Oye, Javi.<eos> Watch your step. Here we are.<eos> Oh, no.

I don't want to be with sick people.<eos> Good morning, Claire.<eos> You're looking pretty today.<eos> Are you expecting guests?<eos> Any minute.
War is always motivated by a profound act of love. Much more than hate.<eos> To fight a war, you have to deeply love the cause and transcend sacrifice.<eos> You fight for who and what you love.<eos> Freedom, power, land, treasure... Open the door, Beau!<eos> Religion, dominance, mother, country, leader.
Uh, guys, guys.<eos> Guys, seriously, you don't wanna do this.<eos> Take him out.<eos> Fuck him up!<eos> No! Not the car!

What are you guys talking about?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Come on.<eos> What were you just talking about?<eos> Just stuff.
Anyway, I'm just so glad that you're back.<eos> I really, really want this to go well.<eos> Lucy has been having such anxiety and I'm just really hoping that this brings her out of her shell.<eos> Do you know her therapist says that she gets her anxiety from watching me?<eos> Me?
I ate raw liver and saltines, and other than that, I couldn't keep a thing down.<eos> You just took the life out of me, and you took and took until one day, I said, "I've had enough."<eos> And I swear, honey deep in my belly, you heard me cry.<eos> You heard how much pain I was in because you and I are bonded no matter who your father is.<eos> The perversion.
People who travel alone... Are usually in search of something, aren't they?<eos> What makes you think that I'm alone?<eos> I see nobody.<eos> Do you always practice your English... Chatting up foreigners?<eos> What?
What sort of sports?<eos> I mean, I'm an English teacher, that's why.<eos> And you?<eos> What are you photographing?<eos> Buildings, mostly.
People... people say all sorts of things in bed.<eos> It doesn't necessarily mean anything.<eos> Please, dear God.<eos> Do you like pesto?<eos> What?
I think it goes somewhere in there.<eos> Yeah. There.<eos> Done.<eos> Your mother would like to see you.<eos> Why?
Do you still think about her?<eos> No.<eos> How come?<eos> When you were a kid, did you guys have a fake tree... Or a real one?<eos> Real.
No problem.<eos> What's your New Year's resolution?<eos> Oh, I don't do them any more.<eos> But on New Year's Eve... Isn't it important to compensate your life?<eos> What?
What?<eos> I think you mean, uh, "contemplate."<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> Fuck. Hey!<eos> Help!
Fuck. Hey!<eos> Help!<eos> No.<eos> Help! Help!<eos> Help!
For many of you, this is gonna be the last English class you're ever gonna take.<eos> So, um, I want you to remember something.<eos> Words are always going to matter.<eos> Right?<eos> What?
- How do you know that?<eos> - How do I know what?<eos> Holly, you're not doing meth again, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, just a little bit.
I wanna tell you that...<eos> - Dad...<eos> - Yeah?<eos> I really want to change the song to Big Sean.<eos> What?
I'm this close to going up there and going postal on the whole goddamn administration.<eos> This close.<eos> Well, you know what?<eos> Maybe you just wanna give 'em a free period and call it a day.<eos> A free period?
I know you teachers all like to stick together. I get it.<eos> But I'm having to fire whole departments.<eos> That's hard on me, too.<eos> Wait, whole departments?<eos> Yeah. Entire departments.
- like we're a couple of students?<eos> - I want everybody to see this.<eos> Teachers don't fight.<eos> We're gonna handle our differences like real men.<eos> What differences?
Yeah, usually I have class now, but I think...<eos> Wait.<eos> Did you lose your job?<eos> No.<eos> What?
Yeah, Daddy, why are you here?<eos> Buying your mom a computer.<eos> Stop it right now.<eos> Yeah, it was supposed to be a surprise...<eos> What?
Hey, what is that?<eos> Hey, stop... Stop that.<eos> Twenty-two years of this motherfucking high school!<eos> So, uh, the truth is, I was mad at Mr. Strickland because he'd given me a bad, but fair grade<eos> - on my last test.
- Here we go.<eos> - Who raped you?<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> Campbell, did you rape this woman?<eos> Whoa, whoa! What?
This ain't right.<eos> Playing pranks used to be fun.<eos> This shit is getting violent.<eos> I look like a fucking minion!<eos> Holy cow!
Well, no.<eos> It wasn't meth. It was molly.<eos> - Molly?<eos> - Yeah. Why?<eos> What?
So just look for that nod and know that he's calling you the biggest bitch on the planet.<eos> Okay. I gotta go.<eos> Okay, so you still wanna fight?<eos> Forget it.<eos> What?
Maybe I went a little overboard earlier.<eos> But at least I did something.<eos> Fight's off.<eos> Wait.<eos> What?
Didn't you hear?<eos> Great news!<eos> Man, stand up, bitch.<eos> What you got?<eos> Oh, no!
It's a bloodbath in there.<eos> Holly, Ms. Monet...<eos> We all got fired.<eos> No!<eos> You, too?
- Sixty seconds.<eos> Shit!<eos> Okay.<eos> What the fuck is going on in there?<eos> Just one more minute.
School's out for the summer, everybody.<eos> Campbell! Campbell!<eos> I'm never gonna stop fighting! Uh-uh!<eos> I'm never gonna stop fighting for myself.<eos> For my family, for this school!
Oh, yeah. Thanks.<eos> Emergency!<eos> Hey, get off your ass, lady.<eos> Sir, emergency's on the other side of the building.<eos> What?
I'm supposed to be the scariest motherfucker in this school, not you.<eos> That's true.<eos> All right, man, you ready to do this thing?<eos> - Do it.<eos> Up top! Down low.
Sadiq, the cops are causing trouble at Narol Chowkdi.<eos> Tell Raees to get the consignment cleared.<eos> I'll see to it.<eos> Down!<eos> Up!
I'll see to it.<eos> Down!<eos> Up!<eos> Down!<eos> Up!
Salaam Aleikom, Seth.<eos> Salaam.<eos> You bring me good luck, my Ace.<eos> You're funny, Seth.<eos> Not aces.
He doesn't have the money.<eos> He needs time.<eos> You have worked for me all these years...<eos> I'll give it to you.<eos> Three days.
Never<eos> I don't care how the world goes by<eos> I just listen to the call of my heart.<eos> Everyone is answerable in life or in death.<eos> In the spirit of business!

- Paper and pen<eos> I can see that.<eos> Give me in writing what you just said.<eos> I'll release him right away.<eos> What?
Beer?<eos> Vodka?<eos> Rum?<eos> Whiskey?<eos> Whose?
Inspector Majmudar wants to see Raees.<eos> You look different in the picture, sir.<eos> Well, they say I'm quite photogenic.<eos> You know whose consignment it was?<eos> Jairaj's.
We'll swim across.<eos> As shrewd as a merchant, as fearless as a warrior!<eos> Get him out.<eos> Climb up and check.<eos> Thanks for the help
May I ask you something?<eos> How did you address your father?<eos> Aunt!<eos> Father.<eos> What else?
He's taking out a procession to ban liquor.<eos> The swine has gone crazy.<eos> I'll fix him.<eos> Call him.<eos> - Pasha here.
Why don't we find a way out?<eos> You find a way out, I'll take the procession out.<eos> The procession will start from the party office and go up to Gotri.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Pasha here.
What about my business?<eos> I'll give you all the facilities in jail.<eos> Do your business from jail.<eos> Who stops you?<eos> Oh, really?
He is Raees.<eos> He's a class apart<eos> I told you, you'd be the first to see Our World when I make it.<eos> - I'll show you today.<eos> - Really?
I promised her that I won't run<eos> I feel this is the perfect distance to shoot, Mr Majmudar.<eos> What say?<eos> Turn around, Raees.<eos> Not in the back.
And hey, you're late on your chapter.<eos> Get back to work, woman.<eos> Bye-bye!<eos> It's a beautiful dress.<eos> Beautiful on you.
This glamorous life in the city.<eos> You're an editor and gorgeous and talented and effortlessly beautiful.<eos> That's very lovely of you to say, and I was terrified to meet you.<eos> I mean, obviously because of Lily and everything, but then on top of that, you're perfect.<eos> All the time.
Thank you.<eos> You're gonna do great here.<eos> And your connection with David, it's...<eos> You talk, you laugh.<eos> What?
- Tessa!<eos> Tessa, what happened?<eos> (GROANS) I don't know.<eos> She just got so angry.<eos> What?
Julia!<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> BOY 1: How's it going?<eos> BOY 2:
You should sleep.<eos> I did not know you spoke my tongue, brother Ciarán.<eos> The abbot said you were far travelled.<eos> - You have seen Rome? - A long time ago.<eos> And the Holy Land? Jerusalem?
- Will you try some of it?<eos> - I have no stomachache, herbalist.<eos> You were to take us to the Merville's border.<eos> Brothers...<eos> Geraldus.
- He cannot speak. - bit his tongue, did he?<eos> - deaf also?<eos> - He can hear you.<eos> But chooses not to.<eos> A pretty box.
Where now?<eos> Tell them they will be paid when we reach to port.<eos> Tell them.<eos> - Why do you laugh?<eos> ! - Geraldus.
Sherlock...<eos> It's never twins.<eos> Hopkins, arrest Wilson.<eos> Dimmock, look in the lymph nodes.<eos> 'Wilson? ' 'Lymph nodes?
It's never twins.<eos> Hopkins, arrest Wilson.<eos> Dimmock, look in the lymph nodes.<eos> 'Wilson? ' 'Lymph nodes?<eos> ' Sherlock...
- Uh, yes, I can do that.<eos> All done.<eos> Have you got it?<eos> Charlie?<eos> A week later...
Well, I think you've hit a sore spot, Sherlock.<eos> Like I'm some kind of credit junkie.<eos> - Definitely a sore spot.<eos> So you take all the glory, thanks...<eos> - OK! - .. Thanks all the same.
'Most people.'<eos> 'Bizarre enough though, isn't it, to be him? '<eos> I mean, it's right up your strasse.<eos> Mr and Mrs Welsborough, I really am most terribly sorry to hear about your daughter.<eos> - Son. - Son!
The whole thing's verging on OCD. My respects.<eos> This figurine is routinely repositioned after the cleaner's been in, this picture is straightened every day, yet this ugly gap remains.<eos> Something's missing from here, but only recently.<eos> Yes, a... Plaster bust... plaster bust.<eos> Oh, for God's sake!
I lack the arrogance to ignore details<eos> - I'm not the police.<eos> So you're saying he smashed it where he could see it.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Why?
Oh, well, there was a case about, um, ten years ago.<eos> Nobody could figure it out.<eos> There was an old lady found dead in a sauna.<eos> Oh, yeah? How did she die?<eos> Hypothermia.
Nobody could figure it out.<eos> There was an old lady found dead in a sauna.<eos> Oh, yeah? How did she die?<eos> Hypothermia.<eos> What?
She's been operating deep undercover for the past four years now as your wife, for one reason only, to get near the American Embassy, across the road from your flat.<eos> Tomorrow the US President will be at the embassy, as part of an official state visit.<eos> As the President greets members of staff, Greta Bengsdotter, disguised as a 22-stone cleaner, will inject the President in the back of the neck with a dangerous new drug, hidden inside a secret compartment inside her padded armpit.<eos> This drug will render the President entirely susceptible to the will of that new master, none other than James Moriarty.<eos> What?
This chain of events will then prove unstoppable, thus precipitating World War III. Are you serious?<eos> No, of course not.<eos> His wife left him because his breath stinks and he likes to wear her lingerie.<eos> I don't!<eos> Just the bras.
So, how does that help us?<eos> What?<eos> Toby the hacker?<eos> Toby's not the hacker.<eos> What?
Slow but sure, John, not dissimilar to yourself.<eos> You just like this dog, don't you?<eos> Well, I like you.<eos> He's still not moving.<eos> Fascinating. Oh!
In a way that was true. In a way?<eos> So many lies.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> And I don't just mean you.<eos> What?
Work things through.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> Mary, I may not be a very good man... ..but I think I'm a bit better than you give me credit for, most of the time.<eos> All the time.
Well, no, we can't just go. Rosie.<eos> Yeah. Er, you go.<eos> No!<eos> I'll come as soon as I've found someone<eos> - Mrs Hudson.
London Aquarium. Yes, now.<eos> I was never a field agent. I always thought I'd be rather good.<eos> Well, you handled the operation in Tbilisi very well.<eos> Thanks.<eos> For a secretary. - What?
You don't need to read it now.<eos> I'm sorry, Sherlock.<eos> He says... John said if you were to come round asking after him, offering to help...<eos> He said he'd... ..that he'd rather have anyone but you.<eos> Anyone.
- ...but it's for real.<eos> - I certainly hope so.<eos> No doubt whatsoever.<eos> As crazy and as whacked out as it sounds I mean, this is the genuine article, Mr....<eos> Kontral.
You know how I feel about that.<eos> What you've just done is horrible.<eos> But necessary.<eos> Your next priority is make sure no one else understands the true nature of this...<eos> Just a moment, just a moment.
- But I am what I am.<eos> Hey, guys, your ride's here.<eos> Thanks, Eli.<eos> Your timing was perfect.<eos> A really decadent stretch limo.
That's not exactly what happened.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> Then tell me what did.<eos> We wrapped up our job.<eos> Our job?
Yeah.<eos> Anyway, you need this more than coffee.<eos> It's no charge.<eos> You look like crap.<eos> Thanks, for the sundae.
- Oh, such malice.<eos> - Yes, that's me.<eos> - How blandly lower middle class.<eos> Just because we butchered your pathetic little sweetheart?<eos> - On your knees.
I have a very strong feeling this thing doesn't want to harm you.<eos> Yeah, well, hopefully that doesn't include you.<eos> Wait.<eos> A valid concern.<eos> On your knees. - What?
Homeward bound, nice and steady, nice and steady.<eos> Second star on the right and straight on to morning.<eos> Damn you.<eos> Now what?<eos> Asshole.
[Kimberly's father] Oh, my God, what have you done?<eos> [Kimberly's mother] Kimberly, what have you done to your hair?<eos> [Kimberly's father] You cut off your hair?<eos> - [Kimberly's father] Kimberly what...<eos> Hey, thanks for that in there.
- [rumbling continues]<eos> [Trini] There's a lotta mine security out tonight.<eos> - [Kimberly] Who is she?<eos> - [Jason] I don't know. I've never seen her before.<eos> - [cracking] - Oh, no.
Get back!<eos> - [Sam] Wide to the port! ...now! - [deckhand] Yeah!<eos> [Candace] Billy!<eos> What's happening down there?<eos> What?
I'm dying.<eos> Just don't finish it.<eos> Thanks.<eos> And I'm really sorry.<eos> Sorry for what?
Welcome to the club!<eos> 'Sup, crazy girl?<eos> - We gotta do that again.<eos> - Hey, guys. Guys!<eos> - [Zack] What?
Different-colored kids!<eos> - I'm so excited you're here! - [all gasp]<eos> Turn around.<eos> Go on.<eos> [Jason] No way.
You can trust me.<eos> What the hell?<eos> [Alpha 5] Why do you keep looking at each other?<eos> Is that, like, a human thing?<eos> Fascinating.
Do we have a choice?<eos> Don't think so.<eos> [Alpha 5 speaking alien language]<eos> Look! It's Zordon!<eos> What?
If the power coins have returned to the ship with these...<eos> Teenagers!<eos> With these teenagers, then these teenagers are the Power Rangers.<eos> Power Rangers!<eos> What?
Okay.<eos> Okay, Trini, let's start over.<eos> Please tell us one thing you did today.<eos> Me and four kids from Angel Grove found a spaceship buried underground.<eos> What?
So this is the pit.<eos> It's nice, right?<eos> [Zordon] Alpha 5, begin the exercise.<eos> [Alpha 5] Uh... sorry, guys.<eos> - What exercise?
If Rita becomes strong enough to build her army, it'll be the beginning of the end.<eos> Rangers, welcome to training.<eos> - I'm so excited you guys are back. - [pop music playing]<eos> - Aim for the center mass.<eos> One more time.
- [country music plays on stereo] Where's the crystal?<eos> Find it, Billy, find it.<eos> Where's the crystal?<eos> [grunts] There.<eos> One, two...
[Billy] Oh, come on, guys.<eos> Wow. - Guys, guys, guys, come on! - Watch it!<eos> [Alpha 5] Wait. What are you doing?<eos> Just stop fighting, please!<eos> What?
- We'll, untie him. Hold this.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> Let's just think about this, okay?<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> Right on time.
Step through, Zordon!<eos> - Hey! - What's happening?<eos> [Alpha 5] The morphing grid is open!<eos> - What's going on?<eos> Zordon?
Seein' my dad.<eos> Welcome back, my friend.<eos> - Oh, we gotta go to Krispy Kreme, Jason.<eos> - What?<eos> Not for donuts.
Kim, I'll go with you.<eos> [Red Ranger] Let's go, boys.<eos> [Black Ranger] Billy, just the two of us.<eos> I'm right behind you.<eos> Oops.
Trust me.<eos> Thanks, Kim.<eos> [Pink Ranger] That's all right.<eos> That's what you get.<eos> The crystal.
[breathing heavily] We're okay.<eos> [Blue Ranger] Guys, help!<eos> [Pink Ranger] Billy, I have an idea.<eos> Ready?<eos> Uh... Yeah? For what exactly?
- What?<eos> - No, no, no. That sounds lame.<eos> Um... a Megazord!<eos> How?<eos> What?
- You're a leg, too?<eos> - I have the arm.<eos> We all have to move together.<eos> I'll lift us.<eos> [Red Ranger] All together on three.
Wanna do café? Yup.<eos> Someone's asleep at the wheel.<eos> what time is it?<eos> 10:30, I think.<eos> Why?
It doesn't make sense!<eos> This took only 35 minutes.<eos> That is a new world record for me.<eos> Thank you.<eos> First, lattes.
Maybe that's why I'm stuck in no man's land.<eos> do you wonder where we are?<eos> Yeah.<eos> do you hear that?<eos> What?
Hi.<eos> Just so were clear. Your boyfriend took me to Europe.<eos> My boyfriend is hungover.<eos> So keep having fun out there.<eos> For the both of us.
And uh, I'll see you at dinner.<eos> I love you.<eos> You still don't have a place to develop them.<eos> I will.<eos> What?
I'm not giving up on you.<eos> I'm not giving up on us.<eos> I know.<eos> Do you hear that?<eos> What?
I'll survive.<eos> We got enough food for the weekend.<eos> It's gonna be a nice little uh, little getaway.<eos> Let's find a spot.<eos> Beautiful.
Oh, god.<eos> Al, you're looking well.<eos> So you didn't get the message, Randa?<eos> To reschedule?<eos> For the fifth time?
Take us closer.<eos> You wanna launch, you do it from here.<eos> Can you punch through that, colonel?<eos> Our opening is now.<eos> Through this hole right here?
Why don't we leave it to colonel Packard to break the tie?<eos> There is no way I'm getting on that helicopter.<eos> We did ask to arm those helicopters.<eos> Shouldn't they know why?<eos> Why?
We did ask to arm those helicopters.<eos> Shouldn't they know why?<eos> Why?<eos> And raise an alarm?<eos> Purely a precaution, Brooks.
Every one of them.<eos> We're on the south side of the island.<eos> There's a river a couple of Klicks from here.<eos> If we stick to its banks, we'll make it to the Exfil site on the north shore.<eos> And then what?
Who told you that, Cole?<eos> My mother.<eos> That actually explains a lot.<eos> Look out!<eos> Oh, shit!
No, no, no.<eos> No need for that.<eos> Come on now!<eos> Everybody, keep your wigs on now!<eos> What?
As far as I can tell, this ship washed up about 10 years before I did.<eos> You've been here since '44? Yeah.<eos> Hey, what happened with the war?<eos> Did we win?<eos> Which one?
Because the Iwis say once Kong goes, then the big one comes up.<eos> Then it's, "goodnight, Irene."<eos> Listen, there's a refueling team coming to the north end of the island in three days.<eos> You should come with us.<eos> To the north end of the island?
Listen, there's a refueling team coming to the north end of the island in three days.<eos> You should come with us.<eos> To the north end of the island?<eos> We're gonna get out of here.<eos> In three days?
Fire in the hole!<eos> There!<eos> Yes!<eos> I repeat, we have a visual.<eos> Two Klicks to our north.
Oh, my god.<eos> Their flare was only two Klicks north.<eos> They should be here soon.<eos> Unless they were eaten by something that's bigger than us.<eos> Holy shit!
Wait a second.<eos> You got someone out there?<eos> Chapman.<eos> He's with the downed sea stallion just west of here.<eos> West?
Go!<eos> Bring the torch!<eos> Do your thing!<eos> Slivko!<eos> Gas!
Weapons!<eos> Enough to kill it.<eos> Kong didn't kill Chapman.<eos> But he did kill these men!<eos> My men!
Oh, it's, er... It's a bit of insurance.<eos> I don't understand. What is that?<eos> TD 12.<eos> One of ours.<eos> One of yours?
Three years ago, my father told me he wanted to kill someone.<eos> One word, Mr Holmes, and it changed my world forever.<eos> Just one word.<eos> What word?<eos> A name.
Are you going out?<eos> I think I remember the way, it's through there, isn't it?<eos> But you're in no state, look at you!<eos> Yeah, well, I've got a friend with me, so...<eos> What friend? Bye.
Your own death is something that happens to everybody else.<eos> Your life is not your own. Keep your hands off it.<eos> You're not what I expected, you...<eos> - What? What am I?<eos> - Nicer.
If you were to come round asking after him 'that he'd rather have anyone but you.<eos> Anyone.<eos> You're not what I expected. - What?<eos> What am I?<eos> - Nicer.
There's only one way that I can solve it.<eos> And what's that?<eos> I need to kill someone.<eos> Who? Who?<eos> Anyone!
Anyone!<eos> Of course!<eos> He doesn't want to kill one person, he wants to kill anyone.<eos> He's a serial killer.<eos> Anyone.
He doesn't want to kill one person, he wants to kill anyone.<eos> He's a serial killer.<eos> Anyone.<eos> - He could be!<eos> - Anyone!
Why not?<eos> Why shouldn't he be?<eos> Oi, you!<eos> What's the matter with you?<eos> 'Anyone!
You've had too much.<eos> And that's me saying that!<eos> Kill.<eos> Kill.<eos> - Anyone. - Anyone.
But those are only the ones we catch.<eos> Who do we catch?<eos> Serial killers.<eos> What if you were rich and... powerful and necessary?<eos> Anyone.
Serial killers.<eos> What if you were rich and... powerful and necessary?<eos> Anyone.<eos> What if you had the compulsion to kill and money?<eos> What then? !
No, of course not! I was on the phone.<eos> - Oh, it's for you, by the way.<eos> - For me?<eos> - It's the Government.<eos> - The what?
Sherlock on Twitter, he really has lost it.<eos> Don't you dare make jokes!<eos> Don't you dare! I was terrified!<eos> Cup of tea!<eos> Oh, for goodness' sakes!
I asked for a cup of tea!<eos> - How did you get him in the boot?<eos> - The boys from the cafe.<eos> They dropped me!<eos> Twice!
Mr Holmes gave me an address.<eos> Well, he couldn't have given you this one...<eos> When you're ready.<eos> When did Sherlock give you this address?<eos> - Two weeks ago.
Well, he couldn't have given you this one...<eos> When you're ready.<eos> When did Sherlock give you this address?<eos> - Two weeks ago.<eos> - Two weeks? 'Yes, two weeks.'
You're really not going to like this.<eos> Like what?<eos> Is, er...<eos> I'm sorry, Sherlock asked me to come.<eos> - What, two weeks ago?
It's funny cos it's true!<eos> See you at the hospital.<eos> Oh, you can have this back now.<eos> - Have what back?<eos> - Thanks for the hug.
Yeah, I called it Murder At The Zoo.<eos> Or was it the case of The Killer Orang-utan?<eos> You should be wearing the hat.<eos> The kids would love the hat.<eos> So, any more questions? No.
Mr Smith, we're actually in the middle of something.<eos> Saheed, isn't it?<eos> Saheed, yes.<eos> How long have you been working here now?<eos> - Four years. - Four years.
Saheed, yes.<eos> How long have you been working here now?<eos> - Four years. - Four years.<eos> Well, that's a long time, isn't it?<eos> Four years!
Good.<eos> Say that for me.<eos> - Say it.<eos> - I don't want to die.<eos> And again.
- Say it.<eos> - I don't want to die.<eos> And again.<eos> I don't... want to die.<eos> Once more, for luck.
Oh, Mr Holmes, I don't know if this is relevant, but... we found three potential recording devices in the pockets of your coat.<eos> All your possessions were searched.<eos> Sorry!<eos> Must be something comforting about the number three, people always give up after three.<eos> What?
Utter, utter cock.<eos> Heard you the first time.<eos> - So, how does it open?<eos> - Screw the top.<eos> - Two weeks ago? - Three.
'Now, what was all that about arresting me?<eos> - 'Well, maybe not arresting you.<eos> - No?<eos> 'I could just keep you under close watch.<eos> - 'Very close?
So, that's it, is it?<eos> You're just going?<eos> Well, don't worry, there's a place for people like you, the desperate, the terrified.<eos> The ones with nowhere else to run.<eos> What place?
You're just going?<eos> Well, don't worry, there's a place for people like you, the desperate, the terrified.<eos> The ones with nowhere else to run.<eos> What place?<eos> 221B Baker Street.
Middle child.<eos> Explains a lot.<eos> - So, did she have it, too?<eos> - Have what?<eos> The deduction thing.
Explains a lot.<eos> - So, did she have it, too?<eos> - Have what?<eos> The deduction thing.<eos> The deduction thing?
John has a daughter, he may wish to say goodbye.<eos> I'm sorry, Dr Watson, any movement will set off the grenade.<eos> I hope you understand.<eos> Oscar Wilde.<eos> What?
- Thank God!<eos> Usually, it's much worse.<eos> I might go and work in a bank!<eos> Is that an helicopter?<eos> No, not in this weather.
- 'Sherrinford.'<eos> I never heard that one before.<eos> Sherrinford?<eos> Forget you ever heard it.<eos> What?
Silence Of The Lambs, basically.<eos> - You what?<eos> - Keep your distance.<eos> Stay at least three feet away from the glass, and all that.<eos> Why the headphones?
'Why aren't you?<eos> 'I'm too clever.'<eos> - Did you bring it?<eos> - Sorry?<eos> My hairband.
You can't see it, can you?<eos> You try and try, but you just can't see, you can't look.<eos> See what?<eos> - What do you think?<eos> - Beautiful.
- It's a Stradivarius.<eos> - It's a gift.<eos> - Who from?<eos> - Me.<eos> - Why?
I warned you.<eos> I ordered you.<eos> She's clinically unique.<eos> We had to try.<eos> At what cost?
No, not Bach.<eos> You clearly don't understand it.<eos> Play you.<eos> - Me?<eos> - You.
'Helping someone is the best way you can help yourself.<eos> 'I don't trust you.'<eos> So, clearly you remember me?<eos> I remember everything.<eos> Every single thing.
You just need a big enough hard drive.<eos> - 'Sherlock?<eos> ' - Not now.<eos> - 'Vatican Cameos.'<eos> - In a minute.
Let's continue.<eos> Did they tell you to keep three feet from the glass?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Be naughty, step closer.<eos> - Why?
How do you want me?<eos> There is, in this facility, a prisoner whose intellectual abilities are of occasional use to the British government.<eos> What, for, like, really difficult sums, long division, that sort of thing?<eos> She predicted the exact dates of the last three terrorist attacks on the British mainland after an hour on Twitter.<eos> That sort of thing.
You are a good man and you are doing a good thing.<eos> So are you.<eos> I'll spend the rest of my life telling myself that.<eos> Please!<eos> Oh, God!
There's a few tasks for you and a girl on a plane is getting very, very scared.<eos> Treats?<eos> Yes.<eos> You know, a violin.<eos> In exchange for?
Choo-choo! '<eos> Someone's been redecorating.<eos> - Is that allowed?<eos> - She's literally taken over the asylum, we have more to worry about than her choice of colour scheme.<eos> Barely dry.
- Is it a city?<eos> - 'I think so.'<eos> She's about to fly over a city in a pilotless plane.<eos> We'll have to talk her through it.<eos> - Through what?
Please, start your deductions.<eos> I will apply some context in a moment.<eos> Well, allowing for the entirely pointless courtesy of headroom, I'd say this coffin is intended for someone of about five foot four.<eos> - Makes it more likely to be a woman.<eos> - Not a child?
Yes, but it's me calling.<eos> 'Hi, this is Molly at the dead centre of town.<eos> 'Leave a message.'<eos> OK, OK.<eos> Just one more time.
Sherlock!<eos> What is it, what do you want?<eos> 'Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock...'<eos> Molly, please, without asking why, just say these words.<eos> What words?
- Eurus, enough!<eos> - Not yet, I think, but nearly.<eos> Remember, there's a plane in the sky and it's not going to land.<eos> - Well?<eos> - Well, what?
What did they discuss?<eos> Five minutes' conversation unsupervised.<eos> Goodbye, brother mine.<eos> No flowers.<eos> My request.
Er... I don't know.<eos> Small.<eos> - Redbeard.<eos> - 'Who's Redbeard? '<eos> Oh, hello.
I'm in the bottom of a well.<eos> Why would there be a well in Sherrinford?<eos> Why is there a draft?<eos> Walls don't contract after you've painted them.<eos> Not real ones.
!<eos> I'm going to find you!<eos> I am finding you!<eos> Well, hurry up, please, because I don't have long!<eos> Yargh!
I know how important this mission is to the company.<eos> Mission?<eos> Well, trust me, ma'am. You got the right baby for this job.<eos> Hands up, devil baby!<eos> Fart! Poop! Doodie!
You don't know anything about me.<eos> So that's how you wanna play it, huh?<eos> Let's see.<eos> Templeton, Timothy.<eos> Middle name...
There's only so much love to go around.<eos> It's like these beads.<eos> You used to have all your parents' love.<eos> All their time.<eos> All their attention.
There's not enough love for the two of us.<eos> Not enough beads to go around.<eos> And then, all of a sudden, there's no place for Tim.<eos> Tim doesn't fit anymore.<eos> Oh, no!
Why? Have we been bad?<eos> No, Staci.<eos> But I'll tell you who is.<eos> Behold our mortal enemy.<eos> Puppies!
Behold our mortal enemy.<eos> Puppies!<eos> No!<eos> That's exactly the problem.<eos> Puppies?
No!<eos> What's that, Lam-Lam?<eos> You want a nose ring?<eos> It's really not my scene, but who am I to judge?<eos> And an eyebrow ring?

So this is where babies come from?<eos> Where'd you think, the cabbage patch?<eos> Magic fairies?<eos> No, my parents told me that...<eos> What?
If I don't find out what that new puppy is and fast... not only will I not get that promotion... I could get fired!<eos> Hey, relax.<eos> I'm sure there's other cool jobs for babies, right?<eos> Meanwhile, two days goes by like that. You better start packing.<eos> What?
This is it!<eos> What? What is it?<eos> Check this out. Take Your Kid to Work Day.<eos> People take children to a place of business?<eos> Why?
You gonna make me?<eos> You can't make me, punk.<eos> - What have you done to me? - Stop!<eos> - Get back here! - No!<eos> No way.
Oh, no. Hey, what's all the racket?<eos> Isn't he adorable?<eos> I've got one for you, too!<eos> Ahoy, matey!<eos> What?
- What?<eos> - Rise and shine!<eos> Is something wrong? Am I fired?<eos> No, you're late for work.<eos> What?
We'll never get through that door.<eos> No, not that door.<eos> The doggy door.<eos> But how do we get past the guard?<eos> No, no, no.
No.<eos> I've seen this before somewhere.<eos> We've gotta find something to replace it with.<eos> You're right.<eos> Like another file.
I know I said it.<eos> Hey, you hit me twice.<eos> Make it a third time.<eos> I think I've seen one here.<eos> Smead manila, pressboard edges.
I know, but it's just so mesmerizing.<eos> I kind of wanna see how it ends.<eos> Yeah, me too.<eos> Well, that didn't end well.<eos> What?
- Oh, Francis, no!<eos> Baby Corp betrayed me!<eos> And I'm finally going to get revenge... with the Forever Puppy.<eos> - Huh? - That's it?<eos> No, no.
- Yes!<eos> You walked right into my trap!<eos> - You'll never get away with this!<eos> - Yeah, not if we...<eos> What?
I'd hate for them to get terminated.<eos> They'd never leave us alone.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> Wait until they meet Puppy Co's certified... in-house childcare expert.<eos> Oh, no.
No.<eos> Please don't go with him.<eos> Francis Francis is trying to...<eos> Believe me... Eugenia won't take her eyes off your children.<eos> Not for one second.
Not for one second.<eos> That's very reassuring.<eos> Now you see them. And now, you don't.<eos> Too-da-loo!<eos> To the airport!
No, no, no.<eos> They're gone.<eos> I failed.<eos> I would've gotten to my parents if I didn't have to go back for you!<eos> What?
Literally, I can't reach the door knobs.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> Don't worry, Tim.<eos> We're gonna save your parents.<eos> And your company.
It won't budge!<eos> What's happening?<eos> Wait a second!<eos> Hey. I know a way to move my parents.<eos> - How?
Wait a second!<eos> Hey. I know a way to move my parents.<eos> - How?<eos> - We can use the puppies!<eos> Upsies.
Blackbird singing in the dead of night<eos> Take these broken wings and learn to fly<eos> All your life<eos> You were only waiting For this moment to arise<eos> - Three...
It's not fair! It's not fair!<eos> That's not right.<eos> Now you're really going to pay!<eos> Oh, yeah? It's time you pick on someone your own size!<eos> What?
With all our heart.<eos> Let's go home.<eos> How do I look?<eos> You look great.<eos> Well, team, good job.
Well, that's intense.<eos> Groot!<eos> Groot, get out of the way!<eos> You're gonna get hurt!<eos> Hi.
Come on!<eos> Disgusting!<eos> The beast's hide is too thick to be pierced from the outside.<eos> I must cut through it from the inside.<eos> Huh?
Rocket, get it to look up.<eos> Hey, you giant Sea-Monkey! Up here!<eos> Watch it, Quill!<eos> I have single-handedly... vanquished the beast!<eos> What?
My mother is from Earth.<eos> And your father?<eos> He ain't from Missouri. That's all I know.<eos> I see it within you.<eos> An unorthodox genealogy.
Now I'm teaching her a lesson!<eos> I didn't realize your motivation was altruism.<eos> It's really a shame the Sovereign have mistaken your intentions... -and they're trying to kill us. -Exactly!<eos> I was being sarcastic!<eos> Oh, no!
Die, spaceship!<eos> You suck, Zylak.<eos> Typical.<eos> Five clicks!<eos> Son of a...
Five clicks!<eos> Son of a...<eos> They went around the field!<eos> Someone destroyed all our ships!<eos> What?
It's not ripe.<eos> Welcome, everyone, to my world.<eos> Wow. You have your own planet?<eos> Come on. No larger than your Earth's Moon.<eos> Humility.
You own a planet and can destroy two dozen spaceships without a suit.<eos> What are you exactly?<eos> I'm what's called a Celestial, sweetheart.<eos> A Celestial, like a god?<eos> Small "g," son.
First thing I remember is flickering... adrift in the cosmos utterly... and entirely alone.<eos> Over millions of years... I learned to control the molecules around me.<eos> I grew smarter and stronger.<eos> And I continued building from there... layer by layer... the very planet you walk on now.<eos> Whoa.
Go!<eos> Down there!<eos> You maniac.<eos> The whole ship's gonna blow.<eos> Not the whole ship.
You are not friends.<eos> You're right.<eos> We're family.<eos> We leave no one behind.<eos> Except maybe you.
Awesome! We're really gonna be able to jack up our prices... if we're two-time galaxy savers.<eos> I seriously can't believe that's where your mind goes.<eos> It was just a random thought, man. I thought we were friends.<eos> Of course, I care about the planets, and the buildings... and all the animals on the planets.<eos> And the people.
He tried to teach me how to control the power.<eos> So, could you?<eos> A little.<eos> I made a ball.<eos> A ball?
We drill into the center, we kill him!<eos> Captain?<eos> What is it, Kraglin?<eos> Hey, remember that Ayesha chick?<eos> Yeah, why?
I don't have any tape. Let me check.<eos> Yo, Yondu...<eos> Do you have any tape?<eos> Gamora? Do you have any tape?<eos> Tape!
No!<eos> He may have been your father, boy, but he wasn't your daddy.<eos> I'm sorry I didn't do none of it right.<eos> I'm damn lucky you're my boy.<eos> What?
Courage is fear that has said it's prayers<eos> Stand by for docking to Mars transfer vehicle<eos> Shuttle speed is good.<eos> Watch your drift Sarah.<eos> Contact.
She is fine Oh this is a disaster<eos> Nathaniel, she's due shortly after they arrive.<eos> We need to get out in front of this<eos> An astronaut behaved irresponsibly and NASA will make a decision what to do as soon as the baby is born<eos> - Decision about what?
Well done. Take a deep breath, here we go. Push push push..<eos> Okay, good<eos> Keep breathing.<eos> You're doing great.<eos> One final push.
- Golf phrase.<eos> You play? - Used to.<eos> What's your favorite thing about earth?<eos> Dreaming. How about you?<eos> So far?
Co ordinates, I need co ordinates.<eos> Brakes, try it.<eos> There is no brakes.<eos> We are gonna have to jump. Let's jump<eos> Oh, no.
Preventing exactly this kind of eventuality.<eos> You hanging this on me?<eos> I admired you more than anyone.<eos> We have been shouldering East Texas for you.<eos> For years..
You know.. When people talk to me that way, they get their ass kicked.<eos> Try it.<eos> I am rocking this gravity.<eos> Okay, Maybe you actually believe it yourself.<eos> - What?
I am rocking this gravity.<eos> Okay, Maybe you actually believe it yourself.<eos> - What?<eos> - I am Sorry.<eos> - For what?
Shaman Neka.<eos> Gardener I think this is some kind of wedding ring, and he married them. That's Shaman Neka.<eos> Alright, How far is it Arizona?<eos> Smile.<eos> Oh no.
Okja!<eos> what are you doing?<eos> Look at all the fish here!<eos> I want fish stew today!<eos> What?
Take it.<eos> Why all of a sudden?<eos> you're not getting married now... but...<eos> Okja is going far away... so you can keep this gold pig instead.<eos> What?
Hock!<eos> Got it?<eos> This is what will happen to her.<eos> This is Okja's fate!<eos> Fate!
What's that?<eos> What the hell?<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> We're not terrorists!<eos> What?
We don't want to hurt you!<eos> Stop... stop the truck!<eos> What the hell is he saying?<eos> Stop... guy.<eos> What?
Stop... stop the truck!<eos> What the hell is he saying?<eos> Stop... guy.<eos> What?<eos> - Hi.
It's beautiful.<eos> you know?<eos> it's me.<eos> What kind of body wash do we have?<eos> Fruity Lucy Lemon?
How long have you and Okja lived together?<eos> Since she was four.<eos> Do you know where she was being taken?<eos> To America.<eos> To the Best Super Pig Competition.
aren't you?<eos> I was about to say that!<eos> of course.<eos> You'll invite her to the Best Super Pig Festival and...<eos> A moving reunion!
The best super pig and the adorable farmer girl forced apart and somehow brought together on our stage.<eos> Lucy.<eos> and then they leave the stage together.<eos> Hand in hand.<eos> Hand in trotter.
Jay. We're about to change everything.<eos> With my shiny antennae.<eos> I'll put some distance between us and them.<eos> We have to test how far the signal reaches.<eos> man.

Janey!<eos> Did you tell anyone?<eos> Anyone! Larry, please, please! I...<eos> Rick, he's coming!<eos> The name!
"You look like a model from the '70s.<eos> "The personal pilot of a James Bond villain. "A 19-year-old koala bear person."<eos> "If any of them were true, I wouldn't have you.<eos> "But they're not, and I do.<eos> "Amazingly.
Be smart. Be a student, man.<eos> It's the last time to have no responsibilities.<eos> Enjoy it. I don't want that.<eos> I want what you have.<eos> An amazing wife, an amazing daughter.
I didn't want to keep it.<eos> It's 'cause you're the best, most honest, smartest, cutest, heaviest, oldest person here.<eos> I'm not the heaviest, or the oldest.<eos> Dad's the oldest and he's the heaviest.<eos> What?
Are you sick?<eos> Good night.<eos> Love you.<eos> I love you, John.<eos> What?
I love you, John.<eos> What?<eos> You're joking, right?<eos> Sasha, you're kidding, right?<eos> What?
Actually, not to me, either.<eos> A guy not finishing up, I've never had that happen before.<eos> Come on.<eos> I'm hungry.<eos> What?
If it's not, then, Elliot, we're all losing our minds at the same time.<eos> And what are the chances of that?<eos> - What the hell is that?<eos> - What is it?<eos> What...
Elliot, there's nothing here.<eos> So, you're not going to be late, right?<eos> No, I'll meet you at 2:00 sharp, right where we parked.<eos> I'm going to find out how real this thing is.<eos> The name...
- You mean the...<eos> - Yeah. He's why I was late to get you.<eos> He's why you're feeling sick.<eos> Have you said the name to anyone?<eos> The name...
But in the end, Larry was a hero.<eos> You tell people that.<eos> Larry erased him, you see.<eos> He did away with everyone who'd heard it before they could pass it on.<eos> But not you.
- Yes.<eos> How did you beat it?<eos> I didn't beat it.<eos> I never knew it.<eos> What?
You better not fuckin' hurt her! Thanks.<eos> I'm coming.<eos> I know it's hard, but don't be afraid.<eos> And don't believe anything you see.<eos> What?
Honey!<eos> Come here!<eos> I was cold!<eos> Oh, I know, honey, but you scared me so much!<eos> Oh, no!
Thank you. I'll keep the card, but unless...<eos> Where the hell do you think you're going?<eos> Well, lookee here.<eos> Otis.<eos> Hello, Buella.
Where the hell do you think you're going?<eos> Well, lookee here.<eos> Otis.<eos> Hello, Buella.<eos> How you?
Thanks, Tracey.<eos> Do you want to make out a little?<eos> What do you think?<eos> Stop.<eos> What?
But, Bill, is there anything else that you would like to tell me before we get the lawyer involved?<eos> Please tell me what's going on.<eos> Ruth Davenport was murdered.<eos> And your prints are all over her apartment.<eos> What? What?
What? What?<eos> Show Mr. Hastings to his new room.<eos> He can meet with his lawyer there.<eos> Right, you're gonna have to come with me now, Bill. Right out here.<eos> To the left here, Bill.
Did you ever see anything like this?<eos> This is what I want.<eos> Are you gonna kill me now?<eos> Yes, Darya.<eos> Phillip?
I missed you in New York, but I see you're still in Buckhorn.<eos> And you're still nowhere, is that correct?<eos> You met with Major Garland Briggs.<eos> How did you know that?<eos> Phillip?
Near Merlin's Market.<eos> It's not far from here.<eos> Far from here.<eos> No, not far from here. It's maybe a $6 or $8 cab ride.<eos> Cab ride.
Well, we'd certainly like to help you.<eos> Would you like a room?<eos> Good meal? A drink?<eos> A little companionship?<eos> On the house.
In the back, Jack.<eos> You're gonna need some change. Some change.<eos> Some change.<eos> Well, how do you want it? You gonna play a game?<eos> Game.
That is not fair, Frank.<eos> And what about Dad's car?<eos> I'm not gonna have him killed in that damn death-trap car. I told you this.<eos> Sammy looked at it, and it's fine.<eos> About two hours ago.
Case files.<eos> And this one... there's nothing written on it.<eos> Okay, Dougie, you need to go upstairs and say good night to Sonny Jim.<eos> He's been waiting up for you.<eos> Up for you.
Okay, Dougie, you need to go upstairs and say good night to Sonny Jim.<eos> He's been waiting up for you.<eos> Up for you.<eos> Go upstairs and say good night to Sonny Jim.<eos> Upstairs!
I don't know when I'm gonna get home.<eos> Thank you, Albert.<eos> And let me remind you that this work you are doing tonight is very, very important. And I will be thinking of you as I drink this... Here you go.<eos> Thank you, sweetheart.<eos> Fine Bordeaux.
Hey, these fucking little towns, they're a pushover, right?<eos> Law enforcement's asleep at the wheel.<eos> Fuckin' sheriff here is like 90 years old or something.<eos> Did you ever the see the movie The King and I?<eos> What?
Yeah?<eos> Can I get a ride with you into town?<eos> II gotta pick up Linda's mail at the P.O.<eos> Sure, Mickey.<eos> Beautiful morning?
She can't afford to leave a tip like that. I know.<eos> Poor thing.<eos> But she just loves our pies.<eos> You know what? Next time, let's treat her.<eos> Yeah, great. Great idea.
What the fuck?<eos> Fuck this.<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> No. No.
Forget it.<eos> What's the matter?<eos> It's a free world. I can voice my opinion.<eos> You sure can.<eos> Brother.
Didn't I tell you?<eos> Jerry, what's going on?<eos> Someone stole your car?<eos> You say the same thing?<eos> What?
Do you know how goddamn lucky I am to have this job to help us survive?<eos> Oh, for crying out loud, do not fuck this up, Tom!<eos> Yeah, Roadhouse. Jean Michel.<eos> Yeah, of course he loved it. Who wouldn't?<eos> What?
The Riddler.<eos> Scarecrow.<eos> Pizza delivery.<eos> - Bane.<eos> - Hello.
- No, ma'am.<eos> Then we have no choice.<eos> The Joker has the upper hand.<eos> We have to surrender Gotham City.<eos> Oh, no.
- Superman.<eos> - Superman's not a bad guy!<eos> Then I'd say that I don't currently have a bad guy.<eos> I am fighting a few different people.<eos> What?
Superman.<eos> Are you seriously saying that there is nothing, nothing special about our relationship?<eos> Let me tell you something, J-bird.<eos> - Batman doesn't do 'ships.<eos> - What?
Copy that.<eos> Also, Alfred is on the 17th floor, grouting tiles in the second bathroom of the fifth master bedroom.<eos> Do you want me to tell Alfred you're home?<eos> No, that's cool, Computer.<eos> Thanks for the update.
My what, now?<eos> Your armored face disguise?<eos> Fine.<eos> - Happy now?<eos> - Indubitably.
I've got a four-point pilot program that I'd love to share with you.<eos> I wanna hear all four points.<eos> - It's called... - I am ready.<eos> It takes a village...<eos> Best opening to a title ever.
Because my dream is for the police force to team up with Batman.<eos> Waiter.<eos> Wouldn't that be better?<eos> And I know that, together, the world's greatest detective and Gotham's finest could clean up these crime-ridden streets.<eos> Forever.
Everybody, get down.<eos> - I...<eos> - Joker, no!<eos> ...surrender.<eos> What?
What do you mean, the rest of my life?<eos> We don't need a vigilante crime fighter now that there's no more crime.<eos> Uh, yes, you do.<eos> You can spend some quality time with your family.<eos> My...
Well, then we can't just let him run around loose in a prison.<eos> He's not loose.<eos> He has to go someplace outside the law.<eos> - Outside the law? - Yeah.<eos> Somewhere like, uh...
Dusting.<eos> You can't let him into the Batcave!<eos> I'm not.<eos> I'm letting him into your life via the Batcave.<eos> What?
Retrieving the Speedwagon.<eos> Atomic batteries to power. Turbines to speed.<eos> Hey, kid. Let's go.<eos> - Oh, shoot!<eos> - What?
Mine can be Robin.<eos> - I'm sorry, say that again?<eos> As in the small, Midwestern frail bird?<eos> Yeah, and I already have a catch phrase. Tweet, tweet, on the street.<eos> - Hard pass.
Hey, you up for another top secret superhero mission to defeat the Joker?<eos> Oh, I am down to stop that clown.<eos> But I don't wanna make my other dad, Bruce Wayne, angry.<eos> Do you think we'll be done before my bedtime?<eos> Bedtime?
Who, me?<eos> No way.<eos> So, where do you keep all the other bad people in this place?<eos> They're standing right behind you.<eos> Hi there, guys.
Look out! Smash!<eos> I guess you're right.<eos> I am going up.<eos> Here comes the...<eos> Phantom Zone!
SEAL Team Six?<eos> Fox Force Five?<eos> Suicide Squad?<eos> No.<eos> Me.
Locked and loaded, sir!<eos> Good. Love that!<eos> I got an idea. We're gonna change course.<eos> I want you to fly straight into that flaming eyeball.<eos> - What?
You're not a traditional bad guy.<eos> But you're not exactly a good guy, either.<eos> - Batman? - Padre?<eos> You even abandoned your friends.<eos> What?
I promise.<eos> And I mean all of them.<eos> One of these buttons has to save my friends.<eos> Self-destruct mode activated.<eos> Self what?
Yeah.<eos> Whoo! I did it!<eos> I don't even know why you bothered coming back.<eos> I was afraid.<eos> What?
Okay. Everybody, listen up.<eos> These monsters want to destroy Gotham City.<eos> That's right.<eos> We need sick new vehicles.<eos> An arsenal of advanced weaponry.
Freeze, Clayface, take this guy out!<eos> Coming through!<eos> Okay, Alfred, bring the pain.<eos> Bringing it, sir.<eos> For Queen and country!
At least if this city is destroyed, I'll die knowing I'm your greatest enemy!<eos> I'm gonna have to die to know it.<eos> Shut up, Joker!<eos> If there's no Gotham, then I'll never get to fight you again.<eos> What?
Mi hijo.<eos> It's Spanish for "son."<eos> This is my family, but it's your family, too.<eos> Do you have a knife?<eos> Why?
You know, Mr. Batman, when you're a talking brick, working at the Phantom Zone, you see a lot of crazy things.<eos> But I've finally seen a man, in order to make the world a better place, take a look at himself and make a change.<eos> Who?<eos> - Superman.<eos> - What?
It's me.<eos> okay?<eos> Then I can leave you guys alone.<eos> I'm afraid Harold Meachum is dead.<eos> What?
I... I remember this.<eos> The whole family died in a plane crash.<eos> is that the one you're talking about?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Anybody else?
- Just make sure you piss in 'em first.<eos> they carry the bad juju from the previous owner.<eos> Only way to get rid of 'em is with your piss.<eos> that's hard to find around here.<eos> What?
Definitely not.<eos> This is either a crazy guy or... it's some sort of setup.<eos> he's really smart.<eos> He's playing on our emotions.<eos> Why?
I want answers.<eos> I want to know what happened.<eos> to my parents... to the company that has my name on it!<eos> That's all you want?<eos> Answers?
Honor the sacrifice of Shou-Lao the Undying.<eos> okay then.<eos> Just remember to have fun along the way.<eos> man.<eos> - Thanks for the food. - Yep.
We need more students here. also...<eos> Thursday nights will be closed for AA meetings.<eos> They pay more than you do.<eos> Otherwise this place is closing.<eos> Here for a lesson?
How did you get in here?<eos> This was always my second home.<eos> I know all the ins and outs.<eos> Your brother tried to have me killed last night.<eos> What?
I can't get over this feeling that maybe... just maybe...<eos> Don't.<eos> You're just torturing yourself if you think this might be Danny.<eos> Probably.<eos> But even so...
Who you calling donkey?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> My mistake.<eos> You apologize, too.<eos> For... for what?
- He started it!<eos> No! No!<eos> It's okay, Danny! It's okay!<eos> Open.<eos> Why?
It's okay, Danny! It's okay!<eos> Open.<eos> Why?<eos> Are you okay, Danny?<eos> What?
I'm not John Anderson.<eos> I'm Danny Rand.<eos> We'll talk about it in our next session. How's that?<eos> Keep practicing your kata.<eos> At least an hour a day.
all this power derives from the harnessing of inner force.<eos> Your chi can be focused and brought into the fight to overcome any obstacle.<eos> Amazing. I love it.<eos> Thanks for showing me.<eos> What?
Was I wrong?<eos> To turn down $100 million?<eos> other than coming to me.<eos> Danny.<eos> Not millions.
You must honor it to the letter or there will be consequences.<eos> I... I understand.<eos> - Kneel.<eos> - What?<eos> On your knees.
- Kneel.<eos> - What?<eos> On your knees.<eos> uh... the glass.<eos> Kneel.
For the future.<eos> So you're not gonna tell me.<eos> It's strategic. That's all.<eos> You know... it really pisses me off.<eos> What?
Leon?<eos> All right.<eos> Place your bets!<eos> Fighters... huh?<eos> - For him?
Megan.<eos> set up a meeting with Joy.<eos> I'll check her schedule.<eos> We should be able to squeeze you in sometime in the next two or three days.<eos> Three days?
At cost.<eos> - You're kidding me.<eos> That is a loss of hundreds of millions of dollars.<eos> He is worse than these bleeding-heart-liberal-trust-fund hipsters wandering around Williamsburg.<eos> thanks for the interview.
- Of Rand Enterprises?<eos> One and the same.<eos> Why did you send your men after Joy Meachum?<eos> Why did your company steal our pier away from us?<eos> What?
I want them out of Rand!<eos> Please...<eos> Put it on.<eos> Where are we going?<eos> For a ride.
Exactly what you said.<eos> They don't have a case.<eos> You don't seem especially happy about it.<eos> Just questioning things, I guess.<eos> What kind of things?
Need something?<eos> I, uh, just wanted to have a talk with you.<eos> Well, um, it'll have to wait till I'm done.<eos> Oh, but I ordered takeout.<eos> You what?
He's in a completely different world, Joy.<eos> He lives in ours now.<eos> Thank you.<eos> To the precious Buddha, the unsurpassable teacher.<eos> To the precious dharma, the unsurpassable protection.
Criminals.<eos> They're using the company as a cover to conduct their own business.<eos> What kind of business?<eos> They're trying to get a synthetic heroin into the city.<eos> Heroin?
Who has her?<eos> The Hand.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> You gotta be kidding me.<eos> What?
His right bronchi are contracting.<eos> He doesn't have very long.<eos> What about his daughter?<eos> It's called da jue zhan.<eos> A grand duel.
Nah, it's too risky.<eos> We can't take that chance.<eos> The duel begins at sundown.<eos> We haven't got much time.<eos> Too risky. Sundown.
Oh, come on.<eos> Megan!<eos> - Did you empty my trash can?<eos> - Maintenance came by early today.<eos> - Why?
Is this for real?<eos> You're that rich kid that everybody thought was dead.<eos> You were on the cover of Forbes. People.<eos> You understand this is a fight to the death, right?<eos> Why?
So I just need something for the pain, and then I'll be on my way.<eos> If I can just get you to sign in, then...<eos> Look...<eos> Look... What would it take?<eos> - Three or four pills, huh?
Hey, Delicia, um... can you check and see which OR<eos> - my John Doe was checked in to?<eos> - Sure.<eos> That's strange.<eos> What?
I could've won.<eos> And I did win.<eos> She cheated.<eos> What was I supposed to do?<eos> What?
I, uh, met her on my deathbed.<eos> She's the one who made the deal, Danny.<eos> Live in service to the Hand, or die in the dark.<eos> She said she knew my father.<eos> What?
We'd, uh... we'd sneak drinks and refill the pots with water so no one knew it was missing.<eos> The wine was so sweet.<eos> In the dead of winter, it tasted warm... like summer.<eos> Tell me another one.<eos> Another story.
The wine was so sweet.<eos> In the dead of winter, it tasted warm... like summer.<eos> Tell me another one.<eos> Another story.<eos> About K'un-Lun.
In the dead of winter, it tasted warm... like summer.<eos> Tell me another one.<eos> Another story.<eos> About K'un-Lun.<eos> Man...
- To get a bundle of arrows.<eos> Hello?<eos> Mr. Meachum. This is Veronica from Ambergris Caye.<eos> - There's a problem with your reservation.<eos> - What kind of problem?
I'm afraid your card was declined.<eos> That's not possible.<eos> Run it again.<eos> We actually did, sir.<eos> Twice.
Where's Dad?<eos> I think you should sit down.<eos> Oh, for Christ's sake.<eos> Something terrible has happened to your father.<eos> What?
What?<eos> He ran out of chia seeds?<eos> You don't wanna go in there.<eos> Why?<eos> Because of me.
Presently unavailable.<eos> Danny, I want to ask you something.<eos> Sure.<eos> If you find out... that Gao indeed did kill your parents... um, you're not gonna do anything stupid, right?<eos> Like what?
Sure.<eos> If you find out... that Gao indeed did kill your parents... um, you're not gonna do anything stupid, right?<eos> Like what?<eos> Kill her?<eos> For example.
You just feel like you can't.<eos> You just need to focus on something else.<eos> Start talking.<eos> There was turbulence.<eos> Just like this.
The offer doesn't expire for another two days.<eos> Oh, it didn't expire.<eos> It was rejected.<eos> The hell it was.<eos> By who?
Well, you get to be the hero who rights the ship.<eos> No.<eos> I'm talking about you and your sister working against each other.<eos> And over what, huh?<eos> A little money?
What's this?<eos> The way back.<eos> Jesus.<eos> - Is this real?<eos> - Fortunately.
I know what I'm doing.<eos> Do you?<eos> Because it looks like we're on the fast track to waterboarding here.<eos> I need to know.<eos> Why?
You didn't know my grandfather.<eos> This is what you do.<eos> You mess with people's heads.<eos> The frog trapped in a well... does not understand the sea.<eos> So what?
But Wendell won't have anything to do with us.<eos> He wasn't willing to make a deal.<eos> is a different story.<eos> He was more than willing to partner up.<eos> What?
Mmm. I don't think I've ever seen you eat any dairy or sugar.<eos> Kyle.<eos> I'm a new man in every way.<eos> yeah. Is there any vanilla?<eos> What?
I'm... I'm sorry.<eos> I'm so sorry. I'm sorry for, you know, I'm sorry for all of... all of this.<eos> I'm just glad the universe listened.<eos> What was it like?<eos> What?
Who's "they"?<eos> Bakuto and his group.<eos> Your sensei?<eos> Our sensei.<eos> Everyone here.
Did you talk to her?<eos> Manipulating as always.<eos> Working an angle.<eos> Trying to get me to question everything.<eos> Even you.
Manipulating as always.<eos> Working an angle.<eos> Trying to get me to question everything.<eos> Even you.<eos> In what way?
No.<eos> Wow. You are the worst Iron Fist ever.<eos> Davos?<eos> You weren't banging the assistant in the copy room again, were you?<eos> What?
Prostitution, embezzling money from the Rand pension fund into your Cayman accounts...<eos> Listen, I don't know what this is all about<eos> - or how this is even possible, but...<eos> - This is about legacy.<eos> Mine... and yours.
Listen, I don't know what this is all about<eos> - or how this is even possible, but...<eos> - This is about legacy.<eos> Mine... and yours.<eos> What?
I guess you better hurry.<eos> Lei Kung sent me to bring you home.<eos> Who the hell are these people?<eos> It's the Hand.<eos> What?
Danny! Go, go, go, go, go, go!<eos> Close the gate!<eos> Come on!<eos> Come on. Come on.<eos> What?
I move that we... reinstate the Meachums... and Mr. Rand.<eos> I second the motion.<eos> All those in favor...<eos> Aye.<eos> To family.
- I didn't run.<eos> - You were gone, Danny.<eos> There one moment, then nothing.<eos> You failed us.<eos> And for what?
- You were gone, Danny.<eos> There one moment, then nothing.<eos> You failed us.<eos> And for what?<eos> For what?
Trained them.<eos> You brought them into the Hand.<eos> Now Kevin's interning in the mayor's office and Becca's in medical school.<eos> We gave them a purpose.<eos> A family.
There are different groups within the Hand, okay?<eos> I'm part of one that is trying to help people.<eos> Then did you think about trying a different name for the group?<eos> Like the Ear?<eos> Or the Arm?
Like the Ear?<eos> Or the Arm?<eos> I didn't want to hurt you.<eos> You lied, Colleen.<eos> To the both of us.
From K'un-Lun?<eos> You told a member of the Hand about me?<eos> He didn't know I was with them.<eos> So you lied to him.<eos> To what?
Name it.<eos> - Your phone.<eos> - What?<eos> Your phone.<eos> - Why?
Or Bakuto's.<eos> Danny!<eos> What are they doing here?<eos> Danny Rand!<eos> On the ground!
And whatever your problem is with Dad... it's your problem.<eos> - I'd like you to leave now.<eos> I'm not going anywhere until you understand why I did what I did last night.<eos> I don't care.<eos> What?
you destroyed my family!<eos> Harold!<eos> The funny part is that now I'm gonna kill you.<eos> You destroyed everything!<eos> My family!
Harold!<eos> The funny part is that now I'm gonna kill you.<eos> You destroyed everything!<eos> My family!<eos> Your family!
Removed?<eos> Killed.<eos> I can help you with that.<eos> I'm listening.<eos> How much farther?
How are you? I am Nuomin.<eos> - Nice to meet you.<eos> - Hi!<eos> Where is Xiaoguang?<eos> Xiaoguang!
I am in the Kunlun Mountains...<eos> Near the border of China and India?<eos> Right. What do you need?<eos> Drill a hole.<eos> A hole for oil?
Of ancient India's Magadha Kingdom.<eos> You wouldn't know about it. We'll talk when you get here.<eos> - OK, see you in 3 days.<eos> - Good.<eos> What else?
I'm going to teach you another chant.<eos> "When upper body moves, the lower echoes."<eos> - "Upper body moves..." - Here it comes!<eos> Powerful grip!<eos> Impressive!
After you.<eos> Come on, Jack.<eos> Just... just one more step.<eos> You okay? What?<eos> Jack! What? Your stomach?
Come on, Jack.<eos> Just... just one more step.<eos> You okay? What?<eos> Jack! What? Your stomach?<eos> Jack!
120 million dollars? - Again.<eos> - We've got 110 right now.<eos> 120 million dollars! Thank you very much!<eos> Just a second.<eos> What?
Brilliant, Xiaoguang.<eos> Come on, let's go!<eos> Don't let go!<eos> Guys, hurry up!<eos> Oh, no!
My tender fresh meat!<eos> Thanks!<eos> That way!<eos> What should we do?<eos> Ferocious!
"Mystical kicks in succession",<eos> Chinese Kung Fu!<eos> If you kick my legs again, the girl dies.<eos> Don't kick him.<eos> Good kick!
He got the memo.<eos> Ize?<eos> Allen?<eos> Ize.<eos> What?
Allen?<eos> Ize.<eos> What?<eos> We got no movement, not a sign of a shadow.<eos> How...
Huh?<eos> Two-man security escort.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Look at 'em.<eos> What?
Ize?<eos> Mm-hmm?<eos> What's your vote now?<eos> Got anyone out there?<eos> Nah.
Yeah, fuck Dean.<eos> Dean was a bitch.<eos> Bad Juju carrying around a dead man's scope.<eos> Something's not right.<eos> What?
You got it?<eos> Fuck.<eos> Fuck, man, you got it?<eos> !<eos> One second!
Hit the fucking antenna, man.<eos> Fuck.<eos> You got eyes on him?<eos> I think I got a shot.<eos> What?
Battle rattle, ghetto grip...<eos> Johnny jihad, friendly fire.<eos> - Your turn, Isaac.<eos> Or should I say "Ize"?<eos> What?
- Will you take something from Matthews?<eos> Like your broken scope?<eos> He's in my crosshairs right now.<eos> I've got eyes on him.<eos> What?
No, I won't.<eos> Yes, you fucking will.<eos> Why wouldn't you?<eos> Because that's not really what you want.<eos> What?
We'll reset in five Mikes.<eos> You got that?<eos> Five Mikes.<eos> Copy that.<eos> What?
- Please. I can move it.<eos> - Not once it's hitched.<eos> But you can come to the impound on 49th to reclaim it any time before six p.m.<eos> Lloyd, what the hell are you doing?<eos> What?
We all did some impressive book-cracking.<eos> Plus, you made it through a prison stint without throwing a single punch.<eos> I'm sure that was hard for a person with your...<eos> - I know.<eos> - Reputation.
But for you, from here on out... it's only gonna get harder, Aaron.<eos> You realize you're only at mile one of the marathon... right?<eos> Everybody's gonna tell you how to feel. Doctors are gonna tell you to stay positive. Your family's gonna tell you not to feel sorry for yourself.<eos> I'm already angry.<eos> At who?
When you left, I got put on a city-wide task force.<eos> Sounds like a promotion.<eos> All I can say is my beat isn't just Harlem anymore.<eos> Now, make no mistake, this is still home.<eos> - The good and the bad.
- What happened here?<eos> Officially, 25-year-old male found deceased in a parked car.<eos> And unofficially?<eos> I think somebody's been using Harlem's youth for what can only be described as late-night duty.<eos> - Couriers?
You know, the Dutch colonists... when they bought Manhattan from the natives, they're said to have acquired the whole thing for... $24.<eos> Ask me, they overpaid.<eos> The contact at the mayor's office... he's ready.<eos> - How soon can we begin?<eos> - Three months.
All I'm saying is you're not the only person the Hand has ever hurt.<eos> It was his fight, too.<eos> And mine.<eos> You're not alone in this.<eos> So what?
But in the end, all it ever did was make them predictable.<eos> They've locked it away.<eos> But a lock is not a lock without a key.<eos> And from the beginning, they have valued one thing above all else.<eos> What?
Far as I know, nothing.<eos> They ghosted right after you left.<eos> If they got their hands in anything, it ain't stuff I've seen.<eos> Then who's recruiting kids out of Harlem and getting them killed?<eos> Kids?
Now your family is worried.<eos> They just wanted to know what happened.<eos> And the cops...<eos> They just wanna know why you started stockpiling explosives.<eos> What?
What did you mean, "chi"?<eos> It's a... It's an energy force.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - We all have it.<eos> Not like that.
- Okay, so what's the difference?<eos> The difference is I live on their block.<eos> The difference is I'm not some billionaire white boy who takes justice into his own hands and slams a black kid against the wall because of his personal vendetta.<eos> Claire told me about you on the way over here.<eos> Not all the mystical parts, but everything else.
It's what you do.<eos> But I'm here to expose you.<eos> I am the Immortal Iron Fist, weapon of K'un-Lun.<eos> - And I'm fulfilling my destiny.<eos> - K'un-Lun.
You know what to do.<eos> - What is it?<eos> - Oh, shit.<eos> - Who's that?<eos> - Bad news.
How are you still hungry?<eos> It takes a lot of energy to summon my chi.<eos> What?<eos> Come on, you've seen it in action.<eos> Twice now.
Don't get too used to it.<eos> What?<eos> - We make quite a team.<eos> - Oh, let's not use that word.<eos> What word?
Determined.<eos> Mr. Rand, I'm sorry your exit from our meeting was so abrupt.<eos> You tried to kill us.<eos> Oh, them maybe.<eos> Not you.
A couple days ago, I'm the one who introduced you to Danny Rand.<eos> Yeah, and you also told me to focus on myself.<eos> Part of me wishes I had listened.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - For what?
Yeah, and you also told me to focus on myself.<eos> Part of me wishes I had listened.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - For what?<eos> All of it.
It's true.<eos> Why else would we be here?<eos> I'm here 'cause I'm a cop.<eos> Trust me, they don't give a shit.<eos> Just in case.
It's because we all want to live to see another day.<eos> You are afraid of dying.<eos> We want to live long enough to go home.<eos> Perhaps... it's time to make a plan without the Black Sky.<eos> Or our fearless leader.
I'm gonna assume it's his Fist.<eos> When he summons it, shit goes sideways.<eos> How long do we have?<eos> Hard to say.<eos> Eh, maybe an hour.
We mean no disloyalty.<eos> Our goals are in alignment, as they have been for centuries.<eos> I am not so sure anymore.<eos> We must honor Sowande by continuing to fight for what he lost.<eos> Life itself.
And you think his target was Midland Circle?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Actually, I think this is it.<eos> - You think?<eos> - Ninety-nine percent.
Maybe.<eos> Actually, I think this is it.<eos> - You think?<eos> - Ninety-nine percent.<eos> Ninety-two percent.
I have proven myself to be the one and only true leader...<eos> His name is Matthew.<eos> And my name... is Elektra Natchios.<eos> You work for me now.<eos> Any questions?
A witness?<eos> What, do you want me to describe how it sounded, Detective?<eos> Perhaps you didn't hear me when I said, "Cut the shit."<eos> Now I hear they took Danny Rand.<eos> A person with that high of a profile?
His pulse is up a little.<eos> Is that good?<eos> Long as it doesn't spike irregularly, sure.<eos> What do you think it was?<eos> Some kinda drug.
For years, Alexandra fostered relationships with everything from crime lords to corporate partners.<eos> Corporate partners?<eos> How do we explain her death to them?<eos> There's no need for explanations.<eos> What?
No.<eos> Maybe.<eos> - So how do we get in?<eos> - Back entrance.<eos> Parking garage.
Maybe there were things in this world that I wasn't ready to confront.<eos> But you... you are not one of them.<eos> I should warn you, I'm stronger than I look.<eos> Not today.<eos> Light!
As far as we can tell, the building itself is on some type of hi-tech lockdown.<eos> Bulletproof glass, the works.<eos> I want teams on every entrance.<eos> Gotta be some way in.<eos> What?
- Are you kidding me?<eos> - What is it, Knight?<eos> Evidence locker at the station was hit.<eos> - When?<eos> - About an hour or so ago.
Yeah, well, do like me.<eos> Don't think about it.<eos> If you told me a week ago that I'd be here with you two, about to blow up some building and fight ninjas to save New York...<eos> For whatever it's worth, I'm glad you're here.<eos> What?
- No.<eos> Sounds about right.<eos> - It should be right up ahead.<eos> Claire, for what it's worth, I know Luke and the other guys have abilities, but so do you.<eos> What?
Life without end.<eos> I'll give you one last chance to experience it with me.<eos> To be who you were meant to be.<eos> I don't need you anymore.<eos> Asshole!
This building is about to explode.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - Wait.<eos> We have to go back.<eos> - Why?
Was that...<eos> All right.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Your legs are so long.<eos> What?
- Have you slept?<eos> - A few hours on the plane.<eos> A couple of pills, I'm good.<eos> So you, first week?<eos> - What?
No.<eos> We have 144 cameras in place here, and it took us just a day to do it and they're virtually invisible.<eos> They come in every color, so camouflaging is a cinch.<eos> This is my favorite. Oh!<eos> Nice catch.
I don't know, I just guessed.<eos> That's really embarrassing.<eos> Sorry.<eos> What do you think?<eos> - Of this? - Yeah.
It could be worse, I guess.<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> They'd want you to tell them about your secret hiking spots.<eos> Oh, so they can put them on TrueYou, ruin it forever?<eos> Ooh, biting commentary.
- Yeah!<eos> So, it looks like I've got 20 minutes here.<eos> Let's try Mom and Dad.<eos> Get you in on it. - Hey, Mae, what's up?<eos> - Hi.
How am I gonna convince her I'm gay?<eos> Just go with me here.<eos> Brian's not above having a one-night stand with a woman, but he's got no room for her emotionally<eos> - because he's in love with me.<eos> - With you?
- It's about having a baby.<eos> - And I'm gone.<eos> - Uh, no, no, no, hang on.<eos> Hang on, one...<eos> Just one second.
- This?<eos> Oh, this just<eos> - Yeah.<eos> improves the chances of conception.<eos> Of what?
Hard no.<eos> Get out.<eos> It's like, I didn't think about the whole, like, having a baby thing, you know?<eos> It's like one thing to trap a person with a baby, but then when you actually have a baby, then you become trapped.<eos> What baby thing?
Solve problems, don't cause them.<eos> Oh, gee whiz, look how fancy this place is.<eos> We don't have anything like this back in North Dakota.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Fascinating.
Why am I a gimp?<eos> Oh, God, just get your kid and get out of here, Dennis.<eos> Yeah, I'll get the kid, but I got to come back because I need to crash here tonight.<eos> I'm not sleeping next to Mac's dildo bike again.<eos> What?
I thought-I thought we were gonna go see the Liberty Bell.<eos> There's no time for that, there's no time.<eos> What... what is going on here, Brian?<eos> All right, listen to me, because we only have a few minutes before they realize they can't hear or see us back here.<eos> What?
Well, you know what, Frank, I'll figure it out, okay?<eos> Because I don't want my kid to grow up like I did.<eos> With some asshole dad who was never even around.<eos> You talking about me or Bruce?<eos> You!
When my father died... he willed his seat to her.<eos> She represents Camorra.<eos> And I can't help but wonder... what I might accomplish in her stead.<eos> You want me to kill...<eos> Gianna D'Antonio?
Glock .34 and .26.<eos> This is the original map of the D'Antonio estate.<eos> Here, you have all the ancient ruins.<eos> Tell me, Mr. Wick, is this a formal event or a social affair?<eos> Social.
May I suggest the Benelli M4?<eos> Custom bolt, carrier release and charging handle.<eos> Textured grips, should your hands get... wet.<eos> An Italian classic.<eos> Dessert?
Operator. How may I direct your call?<eos> Accounts payable. One moment, please.<eos> Accounts payable.<eos> How may I help you? I'd like to open an account.<eos> Name on the account?
Hey, man. You got a quarter?<eos> As I live and breathe!<eos> John Wick.<eos> The man.<eos> The myth.
And he wants the city.<eos> When he's done uptown, you think he's gonna stop at 14th Street?<eos> We'll just have to take care of ourselves.<eos> Oh, yeah? For how long?<eos> And how much blood?
Jonathan.<eos> Winston.<eos> Accounts payable.<eos> One one, one one, one.<eos> In one hour.
So, did you forget something?<eos> No, no, um...<eos> This is really hard to say.<eos> Uh, and forgive me for the timing of this, but, in about 90 days, you're gonna lose everything here.<eos> What?
I'll pay for it, just make it happen.<eos> Okay. Thank you.<eos> Oh, Stella, this is Patrick, my new coach.<eos> - Nice to meet you.<eos> - You, too.
If I don't figure something out, the bank is gonna take the ranch in three months.<eos> Honey, no, it can't be that bad.<eos> I need to borrow $100,000.<eos> Another hundred?<eos> For what?
That is a conversation better i go have myself in person.<eos> Oh. Good.<eos> Yeah, you need two security cameras over the door, at least six down here.<eos> You gotta cover every inch of the place. Twenty-four hour recorded feed. - Got it.<eos> - Twenty-four hours?
Just calm down, everything's gonna be okay.<eos> That's it.<eos> Hey, look, man, i know you don't wanna be in here.<eos> - Keep talking to him.<eos> - You cool?
So, are we doing the right thing?<eos> Come with me.<eos> Hey, doc, thanks for coming out.<eos> - What you got there, bratt?<eos> - Glucosamine.
Hey, doc, thanks for coming out.<eos> - What you got there, bratt?<eos> - Glucosamine.<eos> Miss Davis wants to know if she should give it to the horses.<eos> Tits on a bull.
You get to keep the ranch and save your ass, I'm happy for you.<eos> - I haven't said yes yet.<eos> - Why the hell not?<eos> I told you I needed 24 hours, i wanted to talk to you first.<eos> - What for?
Best thing that ever happened to me.<eos> It made me see that beating i put on that asshole been living with me my whole life... long before he got there.<eos> And now it's gone.<eos> Turns out I'm pretty good with orders.<eos> Pretty good.
The truth is, this majestic animal needs our help.<eos> Overpopulation, drought and other factors are leaving thousands of them left to die out in the plains.<eos> Some of you may have heard that headline on a blog or something.<eos> But I've seen the real thing.<eos> And that....
Drowning.<eos> Kind of ironic, us being at a water park, but, you know, you got to... you got to roll with the punches, you know?<eos> Got to get back out there and live life...<eos> Daddy, Daddy, can I borrow $20?<eos> What?
Well, I think you can get something to eat for a lot less than that, hon.<eos> Dad!<eos> I'm hungry, I'm starving, and you haven't given me any money.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What the hell?
Of course they are!<eos> I think they're actually enjoying this shit!<eos> Oh, they love every second of it!<eos> - They're just pissing all over us!<eos> - Goddamn it.
What country treasures their women?<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> - What am I talking about?<eos> Mom, can I have a slushy?<eos> Yes, in just a minute.
- That could work.<eos> I mean, yeah.<eos> - Great idea.<eos> - You don't think that's creepy?<eos> - What?
And I shall dance on your grave.<eos> Yeah.<eos> This is so great!<eos> And having those other people laugh tells me when I should laugh.<eos> - Good.
Just give me one second.<eos> One, two, three.<eos> - One, two three.<eos> - What?<eos> What?
It wasn't until I reviewed the interrogation footage later that I saw it.<eos> Something very unsettling.<eos> 24 years on the job,<eos> I'd never seen anything like it.<eos> Two hours.
The old bitch.<eos> And I caught him saying some pretty troubling stuff.<eos> What are we watching here?<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> Cats, cats.
What are we watching here?<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> Cats, cats.<eos> Is that me?<eos> Cats.
Are you okay? Hey, Frank, what the hell was that?<eos> What?<eos> I saved your life.<eos> But you called me the "F" word.<eos> So what?
- That's...<eos> - You'd be dead if I didn't!<eos> Okay, okay, I think I'm getting it.<eos> You want me to figure out whether or not a hate crime's been committed?<eos> What?
- Like a bird.<eos> No, no, that's fine.<eos> Her hands are becoming a major problem for me though.<eos> I have Parkinson's disease.<eos> What?
I give her money for coffee every morning on the way to work.<eos> And she's instructed to give a very generous tip to the cashier, Cassie.<eos> "This is from my boss, Dennis."<eos> Now, this establishes both generosity and authority.<eos> Possibly a little dominance.
- He peeps on women.<eos> - That's his move.<eos> He's disgusting.<eos> Like I said, bird watching.<eos> Not you.
Okay, it may have been effective, but it was an offensive slur.<eos> And a bigot should not be entitled to a hero's payout.<eos> You're allowed to use any language you want to save somebody's life.<eos> - Really?<eos> Any language?
I've got nothing to hide.<eos> Just, uh, go get the bike.<eos> I'm-a go get the bike.<eos> I would like to present into evidence, uh... Mac's bike.<eos> What?
Let's, uh...<eos> let's see what we have here.<eos> Okay.<eos> Wow.<eos> What?
Wow.<eos> What?<eos> - What is it?<eos> - Well, you're a winner.<eos> What?
- I mean, I'm actually going insane.<eos> - You know, we're all having a little bit of a hard time right now.<eos> - Yeah. - But we got to fight fire with fire, and Charlie and I refuse to be defeated by this.<eos> We're gonna win this war.<eos> What war?
- Make a ton of mon...<eos> - Mmm.<eos> Yes.<eos> Okay.<eos> What?
And then I painted the rest with, like, magic marker and stuff.<eos> Oh, Christ.<eos> Why did you make a cheese lollipop?<eos> It stinks.<eos> - For-for my nerves.
Mac! Mac!<eos> Mac is in the house, Mac is in the house.<eos> Thanks for the chant, guys. Listen, I need everybody to drop everything and come out to the back alley.<eos> There is an unopened crate out there.<eos> - An un... an unopened crate?
Thanks for the chant, guys. Listen, I need everybody to drop everything and come out to the back alley.<eos> There is an unopened crate out there.<eos> - An un... an unopened crate?<eos> - Crate?<eos> Oh! - Crate?
Um, I can put a fan next to the yuck puddle,<eos> - and the smell's gonna clear everybody out.<eos> - Oh! I don't want to clear everybody out.<eos> I'm saying why are we running out of the bar to-to look<eos> - in some dumb crate?
- just seems, like, totally out of the blue, and, like...<eos> - It's, like, a bullshit thing, right?<eos> - Like...<eos> - Unless... Oh, my God.<eos> What?
- Thanks, Mac.<eos> - Charlie, if you just...<eos> You're not gonna let me talk?<eos> So, uh, you're gay, huh?<eos> For pay or for free?
- Scary, hairy, Mother Mary, quite contrary. - (stammering) Woozy, woozy.<eos> Woozy from sucking lines. - Ho. (whoops) - All right, Frank, Frank, Frank, before you do another thing,<eos> - I wanted to give you a valentine.<eos> - Unbelievable!<eos> Right in front of me?
I'm not gonna let some worm beat me on Valentine's Day.<eos> - Don't talk about...<eos> - Why are you going on and on about it?<eos> I... I did this for you, Charlie.<eos> What?
Okay, fine, Dee.<eos> You know what I'm gonna do?<eos> I'm gonna sing you a song.<eos> Okay?<eos> A Valentine's Day song?
I mean, I-I-I can't believe we blew another opportunity to have a working bar.<eos> To have a successful business together!<eos> Because you assholes get so worked up over Valentine's Day, the dumbest holiday that ever existed!<eos> But I thought you were trying to get us to focus on ourselves and focus on Valentine's Day.<eos> What?
And it's powdered sugar, by the way.<eos> - Oh, he's already eating it.<eos> - I knew that. (sighs) MAC:<eos> DENNIS:<eos> What?
Thank you.<eos> Good morning, Mr. Hyde.<eos> Ana, please, it's Jack.<eos> Tea, right?<eos> Weak, black.
Absolutely.<eos> Go network.<eos> Oh, no, I would. I have plans tonight.<eos> So have your plan come along.<eos> Just for a quick one.
Do you need a hand with that?<eos> I'll manage.<eos> Okay.<eos> I know what you're doing.<eos> What?
You mean, like, do we all sit in a circle and sing the company song in the morning?<eos> Ls the firm well managed?<eos> Are people happy?<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> What?
Kiss me.<eos> What do you want, Anastasia?<eos> I want all of you.<eos> Why do you think you waited?<eos> For sex.
Come on.<eos> The way you wear your hat the way you sip your tea<eos> the memory of all that no, no, they can't take that away from me the way your smile just beams<eos> the way you sing off-key everybody's looking at us.<eos> Not us. You.
Ravenous.<eos> - Do I hear $10, 000?<eos> - Ten!<eos> Now you know what those silver balls do.<eos> Woman'. $15,000.
His online audience is an 18-to-24 demographic, and those are exactly the readers that we should be chasing.<eos> Um, I mean, I can show you the stats.<eos> I think he's worth taking a risk on.<eos> Maybe we should take a look.<eos> Great idea.
Why don't you put the gun down?<eos> You don't know him or what he likes.<eos> You don't give him what he wants. He's pretending with you.<eos> No, Christian.<eos> Kneel.
She had a gun, Ana.<eos> I would have done anything to subdue her.<eos> Where is she now?<eos> Is she here?<eos> What?
It's okay.<eos> I'm right here.<eos> I'm right here.<eos> Marry me.<eos> What?
Like this?<eos> Ls that better?<eos> I meant it.<eos> I wanna marry you.<eos> Why?
What's going on?<eos> What do I get Christian for his birthday?<eos> The boy already has everything except a sense of humor.<eos> His birthday? When is his birthday?<eos> Sunday.
God, Mia, I gotta go.<eos> Okay, okay. But Sunday, or I'll hunt you down myself. Bye.<eos> Ooh, perfect.<eos> Do you have a gift box?<eos> One second.
Right? She's a big deal now.<eos> And how's, uh, your hottie?<eos> Uh, Christian is good.<eos> He asked me to move in with him.<eos> What?
Come on. Kiddies, lighten up.<eos> I brought some for everyone.<eos> You're wimpy bedwetters but we still like you.<eos> Hey, guys, give our good friends here Ajar and Pitt their share.<eos> Oh, no.
Hey, just drop me off over there by the palm tree.<eos> No way.<eos> We gotta save Eva. -Huh?<eos> -I beg your pardon?<eos> Eva?
No way.<eos> We gotta save Eva. -Huh?<eos> -I beg your pardon?<eos> Eva?<eos> Like, my sister?
We gotta save Eva. -Huh?<eos> -I beg your pardon?<eos> Eva?<eos> Like, my sister?<eos> What?
-What did just I say?<eos> -You said what we're not supposed to say.<eos> - You said, "Omar."<eos> - You just said it!<eos> -What?
I see two weird goats down here.<eos> I mean, seriously, you guys don't even know how to get out of a maze?<eos> Everyone knows how to do that.<eos> All you have to do is keep going in the same direction.<eos> Left.
I mean, seriously, you guys don't even know how to get out of a maze?<eos> Everyone knows how to do that.<eos> All you have to do is keep going in the same direction.<eos> Left.<eos> Left.
Everyone knows how to do that.<eos> All you have to do is keep going in the same direction.<eos> Left.<eos> Left.<eos> Left.
Mm?<eos> Okay, so, goat.<eos> Wait.<eos> It wasn't the right left.<eos> Left.
Okay, so, goat.<eos> Wait.<eos> It wasn't the right left.<eos> Left.<eos> Left.
Wait.<eos> It wasn't the right left.<eos> Left.<eos> Left.<eos> Again?
It wasn't the right left.<eos> Left.<eos> Left.<eos> Again?<eos> Left.
So...<eos> - Oh, I love your voice. - Okay, enough babbling.<eos> It's time.<eos> Time?<eos> Time for what?
Time for what?<eos> I can't tell you to break a leg, right?<eos> Come here now.<eos> Watch and learn.<eos> Okay, um... just a sec.
Two. Three.<eos> I'm not gonna make it.<eos> Tell my father I...<eos> Well, we all die someday.<eos> Oh, no!
Yeah, probably.<eos> Can you stop that agreeing thing you've got going on?<eos> It's really annoying.<eos> Okay, sorry.<eos> Ahem. What?
Flower, George, flower.<eos> Yes, just like that.<eos> Eva, good move.<eos> Butterfly, seahorse.<eos> Again.
About my sister, I still think you're better off without her, but--<eos> Wait.<eos> You don't have a friend? What?<eos> Of course I have friends.<eos> Tons!
Tons!<eos> I mean, do you know who my father is? You know.<eos> You never told me, how did you and Pitt meet?<eos> -His family was killed by the Tuaregs.<eos> -Oh. -Barbecue?
I mean, do you know who my father is? You know.<eos> You never told me, how did you and Pitt meet?<eos> -His family was killed by the Tuaregs.<eos> -Oh. -Barbecue?<eos> Keychain?
I know we were only together a few minutes but I thought I felt something there.<eos> Oh, pollen.<eos> Oh, precious.<eos> And then, I ran into Gary, and using just my claws, I freed him from the atrocious mucus while Ajar was just--<eos> What?
-His shop is that way.<eos> -Huh?<eos> That's him.<eos> Let's use the rooftops.<eos> Ohh. What?
How many people were at the party?<eos> I don't know.<eos> We didn't keep tabs on final numbers, we were just telling people to pitch up if they fancied it.<eos> Roughly?<eos> 70, 80...
It is something we're having to deal with - a lot more recently.<eos> - So it's not just him.<eos> Tom and another boy have been caught supplying links and files to a number of other students.<eos> What?<eos> Oh, for God's sake!
- You're welcome.<eos> See you later.<eos> Yeah, what's up, Cath?<eos> Trish was raped at our party on Saturday night.<eos> What?
You don't think I have a right to see my granddaughter?<eos> I do.<eos> I'm thrilled your seven year exhaust of search... has finally come to a fruitful conclusion.<eos> I don't think this is appropriate time to talk.<eos> Certantly not the setting.
Sir, if you please. Take me to jail.<eos> Awkward.<eos> Mary... Stop! Stop!<eos> Listen. Do we have a rule about Saturday morning?<eos> What?
That's Cambridge University. In England.<eos> Who are those people?<eos> My research colleagues.<eos> For what?<eos> Mathematics, of course.
I don't watch TV. But I got hooked on SpongeBob.<eos> Mostly because Roberta loves it.<eos> And on Saturday nights we watch the UFC.<eos> The UFC? Is that... Is that Ultimate Fighting?<eos> Every Saturday.
Do you think she would want her dauther to have access to healthcare?<eos> Of course.<eos> So what do you do, when a little Mary gets sick?<eos> You repair a doctor's boat?<eos> Objection.
And mankind?<eos> Mankind is another story altogether.<eos> What one does when faced with the truth.. Is more difficult than you think.<eos> I learned this the hard way.<eos> A long long time ago.
Until she's better than even you.<eos> But she must never know the truth... about what she is... or how she came to be.<eos> Harder.<eos> You are stronger than this, Diana.<eos> Again.
So... you are here to let me go?<eos> I tried, but it's not up to me.<eos> I even asked them to send me with you..<eos> Or anyone.<eos> In Amazon..
I don't wanna let anyone I care about near. Then why do you want to go back?<eos> I don't think "want" is the word, right?<eos> I guess I gotta try.<eos> My father told me once he said...<eos> Nice outfit.
Probably because they're together.<eos> No... No..<eos> We're not together, I mean, in that way.<eos> This way.<eos> To the war!
She's trying on up to number 226.<eos> Ms. Candy, the whole point was to make her look less distracting.<eos> May I?<eos> Yeah, really?<eos> Specs?
Trust me it's better that way.<eos> You fight without honor.<eos> Who gets paid for honor?<eos> So, what's the job, boss?<eos> Two days tops.
It's for a great cause... Freedom. Friendship... ending the war, friendship...<eos> - Okay, You have no money. - No.<eos> All I want now is a picture of that beautiful face.<eos> You will not need a photo... because I'll go with you.<eos> What?
You don't have to talk about that right now.<eos> What's there?<eos> British tea from the Germans... German beer for the British.<eos> And Edgar Rice Brurroughs novels for both.<eos> And guns!
Alright, let's move.<eos> Help me please.<eos> They have taken everything... houses, food... and those who could not escape... they were taken away as slaves.<eos> Where did that happen?<eos> In Veld...
Hold on one second, sir.<eos> We shouldn't be bothered about setting the peace agreement.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - Ares would never let...<eos> What?
I can not let you do this.<eos> What I do is not up to you.<eos> Diana!<eos> Diana...<eos> The gas.
- Get away from me!<eos> I understand everything now.<eos> It isn't just the Germans that Ares has corrupted.<eos> It's you too.<eos> All of you.
You know that she deserves. That they all do.<eos> Do it!<eos> Diana!<eos> Diana...<eos> What?
It has to be me.<eos> I could save today.<eos> You can save the world.<eos> I wish we had more time.<eos> What?
Something no hero will ever defeat..<eos> And now I know... that only love can truly save the world.<eos> So I stay... I fight and I give... for the world I know can be.<eos> This is my mission now.<eos> Forever.
Quiet as a church mouse.<eos> And the feed was clean before it cut off.<eos> No, no, no, Langley can remote-access that.<eos> We tried that.<eos> Completely offline.
Find something?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> Clear.<eos> Shit!<eos> What?
What?<eos> Alex.<eos> I found Alex.<eos> He's dead.<eos> Copy.
Come on.<eos> They got O'Neill.<eos> She's gone.<eos> Shit.<eos> What?
Found it in the evidence.<eos> Prague to Heathrow to MSY.<eos> That's impossible.<eos> You check the wire yesterday?<eos> On my day off?
-so let's make this quick.<eos> -Riley, you're up.<eos> All right, we should have just enough power to break him down.<eos> He's got an itch.<eos> What?
Come meet me in the generator room.<eos> Copy that.<eos> Tell me what you see.<eos> I see a woman I recruited from INSCOM ten years ago being murdered.<eos> But by what?
Help! Help!<eos> They've been following us, our every move.<eos> He's talking about the ambush at Drosch.<eos> We lost ten good men out there, asshole.<eos> No, no, not by our hands.
-He's fucking with our minds.<eos> But why?<eos> I think you know why.<eos> I mean, after all, you're helping him.<eos> What?
Thirty percent.<eos> Come on, come on.<eos> Forty percent.<eos> Fifty percent.<eos> Sixty percent.
Come on, come on.<eos> Forty percent.<eos> Fifty percent.<eos> Sixty percent.<eos> Seventy percent.
Management, they always recommend what's best for the worker but in your particular case, in order to guarantee your safety, it may be in your best interest if you were to consider making a change.<eos> A radical change, Jake.<eos> The safest isn't just another job, it's another city.<eos> Another home.<eos> Another name.
I think we just need to... To take it slow.<eos> You know, I think it's better.<eos> Yeah, yeah, of course.<eos> Um... I made the bed for you guys so I'm gonna sleep on the sofa tonight.<eos> What?
In their thousands, and little babies too.<eos> All in the hands of cannibals.<eos> Crunching. Little bones. Crunching.<eos> On a more positive note... tonight's Blood Aurora display could be a beauty.<eos> Until for one brief whisper.
Blood!<eos> You drinking alone?<eos> Not if you join me.<eos> Haven't got long.<eos> Shit.
You drinking alone?<eos> Not if you join me.<eos> Haven't got long.<eos> Shit.<eos> Shit.
You alright?<eos> Yeah. My wrist turned... that's all.<eos> I'm fine. I'm fine.<eos> Take me with you.<eos> - What? - Dad.
Gotta go.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Catch up when you get back...<eos> - I just came to say goodbye. I'm heading home for good.<eos> - For good?
I don't like the rash.<eos> I don't have a rash.<eos> I do.<eos> Did you miss me then?<eos> What...?
And now I greet you in the Patriot,<eos> Let me explain, I had 2 weeks to search all over the Soviet Union, To form a team of superheroes, Team to menghentik.<eos> That was his mission,<eos> Teams should you form, is the only one of our expectations,<eos> Any question?
This special clothes will support this function and will disappear with him,<eos> Other features make the object unseen by touching it,<eos> What do we get?<eos> Here, I get,<eos> Not bad, very bad,
Wait,<eos> The threat is still unfinished,<eos> What if we need you again?<eos> It will not happen, I guess I'll see you again,<eos> One more thing, ,
It will not happen, I guess I'll see you again,<eos> One more thing, ,<eos> We have found another Guardian,<eos> Who sent you?<eos> Arum,

You're welcome.<eos> You're talking stripped-down chords.<eos> The drums without the vocals, that's the part I like.<eos> 'Cause then my DJ, he plays the same record on two different turntables.<eos> First, one...
And that's cool because...?<eos> 'Cause you can dance to it.<eos> And I can talk over it.<eos> - Talk?<eos> - For example...
I just...<eos> Wait, what time is it?<eos> I have to...<eos> I'm really late to...<eos> - For what? - Uh...
My aunt was right.<eos> Leon was right.<eos> Mylene was right.<eos> I'm a drug dealer.<eos> What?
And we were free... 'cause the music... was free.<eos> We gotta get out of this contract, out of 10-51, out of this... this Fat Annie business.<eos> Even if it means no record.<eos> We gotta get out.<eos> So, what, Books?
Well, you can tell me anything.<eos> I'll listen with an open mind.<eos> Mr. Asheton wanted Mylene and Regina and me to perform this new song tonight at the Ruby Con.<eos> It's kind of like the new Studio 54.<eos> Like Studio 54?

- Yeah.<eos> - We should burn that motherfucker down.<eos> - Mm-hm. - Really?<eos> No!<eos> No, not really!
- What are you doing?<eos> - Warm as turbo.<eos> Pull that back in line.. Hold on!<eos> Old trick used to play.<eos> In case of emergencies.
Neutralize the shooters and then move on to our objective.<eos> There are two things I want you to keep in mind,<eos> Number one,<eos> I choose you for this squad because you are the most fearsome warriors on the planet.<eos> And number two,
I don't know what you're doing but you better think about this, Toretto.<eos> It ain't too late to stop this.<eos> It is now.<eos> That some bitch just crossed us..<eos> What?
Get a break.<eos> Luke?<eos> I appreciate that.<eos> - It's good to see you, Nobody.<eos> - You too.
Which was surprising because when I saw you in Cuba, I heard about a guy who almost killed you with a motorcycle and you.. let him keep his car?<eos> - Oh, that confused you? - Hmm.<eos> Of course I could've taken his car.<eos> But it's about something bigger.<eos> This way...
It can find anybody, right?<eos> Let's use it to find Dom.<eos> Roman, that is a great idea.<eos> Did you hear that?<eos> Great idea.
- Yeah, princess?<eos> - Find it to rail.<eos> But I've got couple of minutes to spare. If you want me to send you to the hospital again.<eos> - Yo Rules!<eos> - First off,
Fire up the chopper.<eos> Guys, have a bowl and a Big Apple.<eos> Are we travelling like this again?<eos> Because Dom took God's Eye, so we need to stay off the grid.<eos> But like this?
It's why I'm here.<eos> I'll give you until I finish my cup up.<eos> And I'm fucking thirsty.<eos> I got limited time. So won't take up too much of yours.<eos> Oh no.
Well then don't do the same kind of funny math,<eos> It says a DSS agent who has a soul to stop a valid stolen EMP.<eos> Sound familiar huh?<eos> Wanna give me a hand?<eos> - On three?
Hey...!<eos> Target the motorcade.<eos> And here they come.<eos> What is going on?<eos> Ouch.
Good work, Dom.<eos> Meet you at the pick-up.<eos> I think I know where my team's at.<eos> - Where?<eos> - Right in front of me.
Alright, I've had enough of this shit!<eos> Number 11 my Ass.<eos> Don't shrink it.<eos> We got a sub to catch, get in.<eos> What?
- we will take the hit.<eos> - What?<eos> I need to switch cars, right now.<eos> - Roman, here comes the bad part.<eos> - What?
So, how's Ed doing?<eos> I don't know if it's hit him yet.<eos> Yeah, well, he saved that girl.<eos> That's gotta feel pretty good.<eos> Still, three of the best?
It didn't help the intersection had a traffic camera, either.<eos> My advice is, you let me go to the prosecutor now, get him to make a deal.<eos> Because if we go to trial, he will stick to the maximums.<eos> That's what they do. That's how it works.<eos> What kind of deal?
I will walk the walk, Money.<eos> I swear.<eos> Damn right you will.<eos> Open East Gate.<eos> High security first!
What is it?<eos> Ehm, Jennifer's suing us for wrongful death.<eos> I don't know what to do with that, but...<eos> How much is in our checking?<eos> Three months, maybe.
Eses and woods.<eos> 500 Navy Seals.<eos> Ripper, count 'em.<eos> Ready!<eos> Down!
There he is.<eos> Steve's a great guy.<eos> All right, well, pleasure to meet you.<eos> - You, too. - Yeah.<eos> - Thanks for the ride.
Tino, Tino. Let me in!<eos> Where'd he go?<eos> - Yo, open up, man. Come on.<eos> - You're naked. - What?<eos> Yeah, naked.
He's really been there for her.<eos> - Steve.<eos> - Helping out as much as he can.<eos> - Hey, Katey.<eos> - Thanks for the coffee.
- I can't imagine anything filthier than this.<eos> - Just get it done, Steve if you want your parent's house back.<eos> Just pay me.<eos> Don't look at that, come here, don't look at that.<eos> - How about this?
Try to stay calm and wait for the cops.<eos> - Well, where are you going?<eos> - I'm gonna go and get my dog.<eos> - Our dog.<eos> - Our dog!
Wait, wait, wait. - Huh!<eos> - A Casio! I need this, I'm awful with time.<eos> Listen, you ever heard of the, uh, Belarus Bowtie?<eos> First you cut off the testicles then you shove them down throat. Then you have incision here and here. You pop the balls out and it looks like a...<eos> - Bowtie?
I mean, it's classic Salvatore. Perfect.<eos> - Classic Salvatore?<eos> - Absolutely, yes.<eos> Classic Salvatore... where can I find him?<eos> - Hm, why?
Hey there, amigo. Uh, quite a place you got here. Really nice.<eos> Um to start, I would like one of your finest cervezas, por favor.<eos> I believe $2.00 should do it. I don't want no gringo prices.<eos> Oh, my.<eos> Nice boots.
You cute.<eos> Okay, so, it is 8:36 p.m.<eos> I've got my stakeout provisions acquired. - I am headed to the lookout spot right now. - Time to kick the tires and light the fire.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - John, right? Hi.
No, just tell him we represent Lew the Jew.<eos> - Lew the Jew?<eos> - Lew the Jew.<eos> - Hurry up.<eos> - Just a moment.
What else have I got to do?<eos> I'm with you.<eos> To the hounds. Nice.<eos> - You got a flat tire.<eos> - What?
So, I just sat this one out and headed back to the office. You know to do office stuff.<eos> Here you go, buddy. Hold tight, okay, come on.<eos> Ssh, let's get out of here.<eos> Right?<eos> Whoa!
Behold! A good man!<eos> Behold! A man of his calling!<eos> Behold, a witness to God's deep love for us all.<eos> Mrs Geary, I do not wish to be indelicate, but did you pay the grave-diggers the extra shilling?<eos> What extra shilling?
"Exceptional. Exceptional. Exceptional."<eos> "Musket, shipcraft, leadership.<eos> Exceptional."<eos> But, sir, then along came the year of our Lord 1800.<eos> Exceptional in different ways.
We need to burn this.<eos> Atticus, I want an explanation.<eos> Helga, get in! Come on!<eos> It's all right. You've nothing to fear.<eos> What?
Indeed, Your Majesty.<eos> We have to release Delaney.<eos> Aye. It will happen.<eos> On you, Bill, yeah?<eos> Off my streets!
'You told me you loved me.'<eos> My sister.<eos> 'James. 'You shall see me again.'<eos> Yes, sir? Both hands.<eos> Good boy.
Where are you going?<eos> To explain the plans.<eos> I don't want you to tell them the plans.<eos> Besides, you're not coming.<eos> What?
And Brace?<eos> Go to hell!<eos> You marched with Tremain. Now you can march with me.<eos> March where?<eos> For what bloody purpose?
When the inch is burned, the last bid will win.<eos> First item on the list - a merchantman brig commandeered from the Spanish fleet by Captain Reeves, this last 12 months and one.<eos> Currently, the brig is named Felice Adventurero.<eos> Who will start the bidding?<eos> 610. 620.
I met her.<eos> People are saying you're mad.<eos> I like to see what lies beneath.<eos> You have goodness in you.<eos> What goodness?
"Lorna, it is in a moment" "that I would leave this cursed house by the river" "and go to the Americas with you and live there, naked and savage,"<eos> That kind of thing.<eos> Do you possess any other documents of his?<eos> I have letters.<eos> Other than letters?
An event which may be imminent.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, please, welcome to London violin virtuoso Nicolas Mori.<eos> Tonight, composer Ludwig van Beethoven's Sixth Symphony.<eos> James, please, don't.<eos> What?
Before, they laughed.<eos> They stopped laughing out there. That's good.<eos> That's a good thing, Godders.<eos> James.<eos> For God's sake.
All part of the plan.<eos> I have things to do.<eos> We're all just part of the plan, aren't we, sir?<eos> Buy her some flowers.<eos> Flowers.
Good day.<eos> You have ash on your hands.<eos> Where is the maid?<eos> I sent her out.<eos> For champagne? Or potatoes?
You have ash on your hands.<eos> Where is the maid?<eos> I sent her out.<eos> For champagne? Or potatoes?<eos> Or both?
I think the Prince may be amused.<eos> All these chemicals I ingest... chase lines of Shakespeare out of me sometimes unbidden.<eos> Which brings me to that rather delightful woman you were at the party with. An actress, she told me.<eos> Is she yours or... could a chemist call upon her?<eos> For tea or something?
Making gunpowder and being careful are good bedfellows.<eos> What? What do you see?<eos> He's just scared of you.<eos> Everybody's scared of you.<eos> Thankfully.
You need a priest, my dear.<eos> Come.<eos> Mr. George Chichester, Esquire.<eos> I don't.<eos> In the day?
Think of it as like adding a baby to a marriage.<eos> All was ordered and calm and now there is this thing that demands attention.<eos> Stops you sleeping, belches, farts, screams... and she's going to make this whole process louder and wilder, more insane, more impractical... and the only thing that will stop this entire enterprise from erupting in a giant explosion the size of Mauritius is this... and dedication.<eos> Because, from now on, until the powder is complete, we have to stir.<eos> Continuously!
Help yourself to breakfast.<eos> It's been two days.<eos> Why are you not looking for him?<eos> We had words.<eos> What words?
It's been two days.<eos> Why are you not looking for him?<eos> We had words.<eos> What words?<eos> A family matter.
- enjoys the beatings...<eos> - I don't need to...<eos> An actress... who enjoys walking with a man with human flesh in his teeth.<eos> You know, you can even buy a song about Delaney now.<eos> In Covent Garden, for a penny.
What do you have?<eos> Powder.<eos> When will you deliver? Tomorrow, at midnight.<eos> Zilpha, open this door! Zilpha!<eos> Zilpha!
Cholera, you say?<eos> Well... let's have a look, shall we?<eos> Torch.<eos> I wouldn't do that.<eos> Jesus Christ.
I will deal with it.<eos> Go home.<eos> Mount up. We have him, men. Hurry up.<eos> Keep moving!<eos> To the heath!
Your father was poisoned.<eos> I would say heavy doses over a short period.<eos> Brace, what's the matter?<eos> The truth.
Gentlemen.<eos> Sir?<eos> Can we go now?<eos> Go?<eos> No, no, no, no.
We are aware that you have a certain... capacity for pain... which is why we've invited Dr. Ling.<eos> His unearthly potions... alter perceptions.<eos> The ducks will be flying.<eos> All the coaches to Bath and Southampton - are being searched, Your Highness.<eos> - For what? For whom?
Goddamn it, where are you?<eos> The lady at his lodging said she hadn't seen him since this morning, sir.<eos> Oh, fuck.<eos> It seems there is much about our friend Godfrey that we didn't know, sir.<eos> What?
Carlsbad said, "You know", Delaney might just be crazy enough to take us all on...<eos> "The King, the Company and the free fifteen."<eos> Maybe she was right.<eos> Well, you tell Carlsbad... from me... that I will cede sovereignty of Nootka Sound to whichever nation offers me their monopoly... on the trade of furs for tea from Fort George to Canton.<eos> A monopoly.
He's my brother-in-law.<eos> He says the best bit of a man to eat is this.<eos> It's tender.<eos> Did you bring me salt beef?<eos> - Pork.
Teach me about magic.<eos> I want to be a wolf, too, or a bird so I can fly.<eos> The bird on your neck...<eos> I know what it is...<eos> The Sankofa.
Since you came back, our fucking has become almost murderous.<eos> It exhausts us.<eos> To think I have this wicked... wicked thing beneath me and it's my lifelong duty to punish her.<eos> It exhausts us both.<eos> A beautiful exhaustion.
How like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony's nephew?<eos> Very vilely in the morning when he's sober and most vilely in the afternoon when he's drunk.<eos> When he's best he's little worse than a man, and when he's worst he's little better than a beast.<eos> - Hurry up!<eos> - Vestris!
How much weight has he lost?<eos> I-I-I think he's lost a lot of weight. In a good way.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Dougie, last time I saw you, you were quite overweight.<eos> - Weight? - Yes.
Then when we get sick, the pharmaceutical companies make billions!<eos> They own the fucking hospitals. Filled to the brim.<eos> They own the morgues! They own the embalming fluids!<eos> They own the mortuaries, the graveyards!<eos> These fucks!
I'm going out, Lucy.<eos> I-I see the mailman. I'm gonna collect the mail.<eos> But he'll bring it in.<eos> Well, I'm gonna save him the trouble and go out and enjoy this beautiful day.<eos> Beautiful day.
Yeah. What did he just say?<eos> You want me to get him and bring him here?<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Did we ask her to tell him her life story?<eos> For four fuckin' hours?
Nice.<eos> It's okay. I got it.<eos> There's someone there.<eos> Go tell mom.<eos> What?
What the hell? Are you okay, sweetheart?<eos> Can you give me a ride to the double r, carl?<eos> What the hell happened?<eos> Becky and steven are fighting again.<eos> Oh, god.
This is briggs.<eos> Deputy briggs.<eos> Bobby, it's shelly.<eos> Becky took off with the car.<eos> Whose car?
And I'm sorry.<eos> You're staying with me tonight, okay?<eos> See you later?<eos> Same place?<eos> Everybody down!
Yep.<eos> I'm in.<eos> I'll brief you in detail in the morning.<eos> To Tammy and the Blue Rose.<eos> The Blue Rose. The Blue Rose.
Okay.<eos> Leave this place. Find the car key.<eos> Find the car key. Get the car key. Get the car...<eos> Get the goddamn car key!<eos> What?
I told you, don't talk that way to your husband.<eos> I've been good to you.<eos> You always say it, how I've been good to you.<eos> Who cares?<eos> What?
Sorry to call so late.<eos> I wanted to ask you something. Okay?<eos> Yeah, so Chuck told me you might have been the last person to see Billy.<eos> Is this true?<eos> What?
Real simple. This man is our boss... 'cause no one can beat him at arm wrestling.<eos> Imagine all the men who've tried.<eos> Many, many. In 14 years, no one's ever even come close.<eos> Any new guy gets one chance.<eos> One chance.
- What?<eos> - No, it gets better.<eos> He's a missing FBI agent.<eos> That's a huge fucking mistake!<eos> What?
Hey. All right.<eos> Turkey and cheese.<eos> Ham and cheese.<eos> Roast beef and cheese.<eos> And just cheese.
Me too.<eos> But I was hoping you'd consider swapping the barn for your old room?<eos> Fine.<eos> You win.<eos> But just this once.
It's the leaves of a shrub that you chew like tobacco.<eos> Okay. Still reading the dictionary for fun?<eos> Everything okay?<eos> You know I'm here for you, right?<eos> What?
- Aria... - I can't have kids.<eos> It's alright.<eos> Great. She skipped out on you.<eos> - Caleb, who are you calling?<eos> - The cops.
Hanna, the last time we saw Mona she tried to push you off the bell tower.<eos> Yeah, and she feels bad about that.<eos> Can we just pretend for one night that she's a friend?<eos> Who are we pretending as a friend?<eos> - Mona.
Breath mints?<eos> I mean, your mom's pretty passive aggressive and there were onions on those sliders.<eos> My mom avoided me all night.<eos> - What is going on?<eos> - Nothing.
You don't have to do this.<eos> Look, you became A.D. because of Charlotte.<eos> I understand that and my friends will too.<eos> Okay, they'll forgive you just like we forgave Mona.<eos> So what?
Oh, it's called horse hair.<eos> I was at the stables this morning with Toby.<eos> Well, maybe you can convince him to stay for a while.<eos> Yeah, I think I'd like to try.<eos> - Thanks again.
Which way?<eos> Uh, uh, Spencer, over here!<eos> Over here.<eos> Spencer, now!<eos> Oh, my God.
It's all fake.<eos> No, there's gotta be a way out of here.<eos> What is this place?<eos> I don't know, but we're about to find out.<eos> Anything?
Well, Dick, Helmand province ain't exactly about to secure itself.<eos> Probably should've asked for a lot more. I just thought 40,000 sounded like a reasonable number.<eos> There's no reasonable number, Glen, except perhaps zero.<eos> That's a reasonable number.<eos> Zero.
- My uniform is in my bag.<eos> It's too dangerous for me to wear it while I am walking here from my home.<eos> Unzip it.<eos> Unzip the bag.<eos> My uniform.
And the president has tough decisions to make.<eos> How many times have you spoken to the president since you've been here?<eos> Since I've been here in Afghanistan, leading ISAF?<eos> Yes.<eos> Once.
Oh, no, monsieur.<eos> Big volcano.<eos> No take off.<eos> Well, this is General Glen McMahon we're talking about here.<eos> Oh, General Glen McMahon.
What world leader doesn't have a phone in his bedroom?<eos> Does he have a cell phone in there?<eos> - Did you try his cell phone?<eos> - Straight to voice mail.<eos> What?
Who told you about tonight?<eos> I just mean... whatever you happen to find yourself doing tonight, good luck with it.<eos> Go fuck yourself, Pat.<eos> Glen? Glen.<eos> What?
Now that was pithy too, but it was true.<eos> Fuck you!<eos> Roger that.<eos> What was that about, buddy?<eos> Nothing.
Farrenberg.<eos> Move.<eos> Contact front!<eos> Move! Move!<eos> Up against the wall!
Ortega! What's going on up there?<eos> What the fuck's going on up there, guys?<eos> Cover!<eos> Fuck.<eos> Fucking short, man!
Cover!<eos> Fuck.<eos> Fucking short, man!<eos> Fuck.<eos> - Again!
Fuck.<eos> - Again!<eos> - Short!<eos> - I know.<eos> One more!
Anyway, you're gonna love it.<eos> Do you surf?<eos> Do you have a husband, or...?<eos> I shouldn't assume.<eos> Boyfriend, girlfriend?
You're... so nice.<eos> Thank you.<eos> This is Monterey.<eos> We pound people with nice.<eos> To death.
Thank you.<eos> This is Monterey.<eos> We pound people with nice.<eos> To death.<eos> What?
Bruises heal, stigmas can last a lifetime.<eos> You don't think assault victims bear lifetime emotional injuries?<eos> I don't know. Is there a recent study you'd like to illuminate the family about, Abigail?<eos> - All right.<eos> - All right, what?
Look at me, look at me.<eos> Yeah, but a big smile.<eos> Can you guy... and just a little bit closer together, guys.<eos> Hey, Mom, you wanna play Angry Beaver?<eos> In a minute.
Every time we go down there, I'd just, like, scare them away.<eos> - How?<eos> - With my... burping superpower.<eos> - Do you want to know a secret?<eos> - What?
You had quite a tour of duty in the lower levels of hell.<eos> Here, give her to me.<eos> Go enjoy your party.<eos> I'll get it.<eos> My gosh.
Not to sound creepy, but it was a way to make sure that you're both okay.<eos> I saw the baby.<eos> And I had to come.<eos> Man, Norma Louise must be over the moon about this.<eos> What?
It's bullshit.<eos> It's politics.<eos> I'm... I'm a crooked cop, Phil; That's what they do.<eos> Yeah, make an example out of you.<eos> Two more years.
I just felt so strong, like life had given me a second chance.<eos> Can I... can I talk to you about something?<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> Well, I want to thank you.<eos> For... what?
Come with me!<eos> You want to see what I do for you?<eos> No, I don't, Mother.<eos> Let's just drop this.<eos> A little late for that.
We have... to go... pick it up.<eos> - How exciting!<eos> - I know!<eos> - I'll be right back. - Right.<eos> Just one second.
Don't you think?<eos> Are you the charmer? Call it the romantic in me.<eos> The guys in the floor calls me the poet, these boneheads.<eos> They like to make fun. And what form of payment will you be using today, sir?<eos> Her.
What is that? You're walking exactly like the geese.<eos> Don't watch the geese, okay?<eos> A girl pass by, turn around, walk backwards, sexy, sexy.<eos> What is this? What is this? What is this?<eos> One more time.
You want everyone to see down here.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> Look at me.<eos> You learn from the best.<eos> Okay, one more time.
You learn from the best.<eos> Okay, one more time.<eos> You feel sexy right now? - Yeah.<eos> - Great.<eos> Okay, one more time.
- Great.<eos> Okay, one more time.<eos> Exactly, exactly, exactly.<eos> Much better.<eos> One more time.
No, no.<eos> Can't unbreak this egg.<eos> Alright, they loved you. They thought you were incredible.<eos> But they're gonna go with someone who has...<eos> - More experience.
- Understood?<eos> - Yes, mommy.<eos> Understood? I don't speak English.<eos> Don't be an idiot.<eos> Why with a tortilla?
I'm gonna grab a Coke.<eos> You want one? Cokes have no nutritional value.<eos> Neither do eggplants.<eos> Okay, two Cokes.<eos> Nice form.
Funny.<eos> So, do you need something? Or did you just come here to tell the sink joke?<eos> I came here to ask you if you're free on Saturday and if you wanted to...<eos> If you wanted to come out on a date with me.<eos> What?
Now we're talking.<eos> Don't sprinkle the toilet.<eos> I'll do my best.<eos> God!<eos> Now what?
Can we start over?<eos> Is that a planetary watch?<eos> Wanna check out the rest of my party? - Sure.<eos> - Beautiful party.<eos> Such a beautiful day.
Eye contact.<eos> Don't lose eye contact.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - I'm about to pay you back.<eos> What?
Ride like the wind.<eos> Hey, sloucher jerk!<eos> I'm okay, I'm okay.<eos> You have the right to remain silent.<eos> Not in the face.
Today is Monday. You're too late.<eos> No, it's never too late!<eos> This time it is.<eos> 24 hours late to be exact.<eos> Thanks for the camera.
But, I am strong, I am determined.<eos> And I know that I will find my dream job someday.<eos> - Yes, you will.<eos> - Yes, I will. And that day is today.<eos> What?
You can finish that in the car.<eos> Let's go.<eos> I don't mean to do your job, but it begs the question... is she running from something?<eos> You cannot be serious, Joseph.<eos> What?
Do you understand the precedent that you'd be setting?<eos> Don't yell at me.<eos> You know what? I'm a lady and I've never said this to anybody, ever, in my entire life, but I'm gonna say it to you.<eos> You can go fuck yourself on the head.<eos> Right on the head?
Our perimenopausal class.<eos> That won't be necessary.<eos> I won't be coming back.<eos> Okay, you will never believe what she just said to me.<eos> What?
I won't be coming back.<eos> Okay, you will never believe what she just said to me.<eos> What?<eos> Here.<eos> What?
I didn't dismiss anything.<eos> - I just don't want to be blamed...<eos> - Yeah, you know what I think?<eos> You didn't want me to be there for orientation.<eos> What?
- Let me call you right back.<eos> - But I...<eos> Chloe, get in the car.<eos> Chloe, get in the car right now.<eos> What?
- How are you?<eos> - Everyone's making me angry.<eos> - I'm sorry to hear that.<eos> - Except for you.<eos> - And me.
- Everyone's making me angry.<eos> - I'm sorry to hear that.<eos> - Except for you.<eos> - And me.<eos> - And you guys.
So much so, I find myself fantasizing that somebody will come along one day and say or do something to me that'll offer me the chance to redeem myself.<eos> You've always treated me quite well, Nathan.<eos> It's too bad.<eos> Too bad.<eos> What?
Taking my wife and my little niece.<eos> Amabella passed out her invitations on Wednesday morning.<eos> Madeline was on the phone inviting the kids to Disney on Ice by Thursday noon.<eos> The two events were scheduled for the same day, same time.<eos> A vicious shot over the bow.
Sexual assault?<eos> It appears Ziggy kissed Amabella, and the advance was unwelcome and a little aggressive.<eos> Ziggy kissed Amabella.<eos> Ziggy kissed...<eos> Amabella.
And the boys miss you.<eos> So, how was their second day?<eos> It was fine.<eos> Hey, will you do me a favor?<eos> What?
I saw you crying at school today.<eos> I was just stressed out.<eos> I'm sorry you had to see that.<eos> At pick-up I heard one of the mothers say I was a little monster.<eos> What?
- You should be in class.<eos> Was it the night of the lacrosse game?<eos> You saw the lightning, the men, and the horses?<eos> Dozens of them.<eos> Then what?
I'm right here.<eos> Mil...<eos> You have to add...<eos> You have to add...<eos> What?
Once it's done, whatever happens will be your responsibility.<eos> Liam, wait!<eos> Mel - Celtic for honey.<eos> Not an herb, but it is a binding agent and a natural antibiotic.<eos> Oh, God.
He wants it for himself.<eos> His own personal, supernatural army.<eos> We need to warn Scott.<eos> You know what the best part about being a werewolf is?<eos> Supernatural hearing.
And then the strangest thing happened.<eos> What?<eos> I thought I saw him.<eos> It's like something opened right there in the middle of the room.<eos> Just for a moment.
He goes back now.<eos> - Except Liam's the one with the sword.<eos> - Shut up!<eos> Can you give me a second alone with Theo?<eos> - Why?
We can use that to catch one and keep him there until we figure out what they want.<eos> It's a good idea.<eos> You're trying to catch a Ghost Rider.<eos> A million things can go wrong.<eos> Terrible idea.
Lightning will just bounce off it.<eos> Which is the same reason it'll hold him in.<eos> If the Ghost Rider lands here, how do we get him in the cage?<eos> We have to lure him in.<eos> - Bait?
I'm not dead yet.<eos> I think they put that there to protect me.<eos> Glad to see you're obeying hospital protocols.<eos> Your daughter asked me to treat you.<eos> In exchange for what?
Try and talk to him.<eos> Mr. Ghost Rider?<eos> Mr. Rider?<eos> We'll let you out if you tell us how to get our friends back.<eos> Everyone.
We just have to figure out how to communicate with him.<eos> Maybe he can't hear us.<eos> Maybe he speaks an ancient language.<eos> Maybe he only responds to pain.<eos> Or fear.
Finding you.<eos> Did you see anything on your end?<eos> No. It's all clear.<eos> I wish we knew what was happening.<eos> Anything?
Remember how I thought that the Ghost Riders<eos> - were scared of him?<eos> - At the party?<eos> I think that he was actually trying to communicate with him.<eos> On your knees.
- were scared of him?<eos> - At the party?<eos> I think that he was actually trying to communicate with him.<eos> On your knees.<eos> On your knees.
I bet it's working.<eos> Hey, hey, Parrish, Parrish, stop!<eos> No!<eos> Yeah, we need to do something.<eos> Yeah. On three.
Hauptmann?<eos> It's them?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And judging by the sound, we don't have a lot of time.<eos> For what?
I'm an atheist.<eos> Fire at will.<eos> You're gonna need to be a bit closer than that, Sheriff.<eos> Wave it over the card reader, come on. Right here.<eos> Up and down.
Up and down.<eos> You can do it.<eos> Sheriff, we need him.<eos> Tell me something.<eos> What?
Just one.<eos> You swipe that key card, I'll tell you anything you want.<eos> Sheriff.<eos> They are coming.<eos> One thing.
You swipe that key card, I'll tell you anything you want.<eos> Sheriff.<eos> They are coming.<eos> One thing.<eos> Just one thing!
STILES: I think I'm having a panic attack.<eos> Okay. Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> Just try and think about something else.<eos> Like what?
I can't explain it.<eos> I have to show you.<eos> Uh, all right.<eos> You guys stay here.<eos> Just in case.
Why is there a train station in the middle of the library?<eos> There's also a train station in the Wild Hunt.<eos> Any chance they're connected?<eos> I would say high.<eos> Like 100%.
Ich bin dein Anfuhrer!<eos> Obey me.<eos> Gehorcht mir.<eos> Kill them.<eos> All of them.
No.<eos> To the Seniors, I'll see you at graduation.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> That's it?<eos> What?
Yo! You need to get in here and pick out a wedding cake, or I'm gonna pick one out for you, and it'll be carrot.<eos> This is my fiancé, Christopher, the man who stole my heart...<eos> You've reached Christopher Hall.<eos> Please leave a message.<eos> Along with everything else.
Ooh, shaking with both hands.<eos> - He's overcompensating.<eos> - So are you right now.<eos> Well, thank you both for everything.<eos> And for understanding.
We'd get your case thrown out on a technicality.<eos> You can just do that?<eos> We can.<eos> - How long would this deal be?<eos> - Three years.
You can just do that?<eos> We can.<eos> - How long would this deal be?<eos> - Three years.<eos> - One.
Well, that's the thing about friendship, Benji.<eos> You shouldn't have to ask.<eos> I shouldn't have to ask.<eos> - May I see your phone, please?<eos> - Why?
That hotel was our insurance policy.<eos> Well, that's where you're wrong because there is no payout for arson.<eos> Your father stashed millions there...<eos> In the walls, in the floor, in cash, in gold...<eos> Just in case.
I love pit bulls.<eos> Me too.<eos> They're the best dogs in the world.<eos> Except for the ones that bite people's faces off.<eos> Next question...
What's your favorite album?<eos> I mean, I'll always love "The Dreaming,"<eos> - but "Hounds of Love" is so amazing!<eos> - "Hounds of Love"!<eos> For God's sake.
Stop it!<eos> You did not.<eos> In Tucson?<eos> No, in Mumbai.<eos> What?
- You did not.<eos> - I did.<eos> You did not.<eos> You were detained there under suspicion of drug trafficking.<eos> Next question.
Dad's not a con man.<eos> Okay, you're right. Yeah.<eos> Dad is strictly an... an amateur cheat and thief and liar.<eos> I do not have a daddy thing.<eos> What?
We just have to get to that part.<eos> Which means getting to Galinda.<eos> Since the separation, Galinda has gone after all of Mangels' assets, which is why there is an armed body man with her at all times.<eos> What does Mangels want us to grab?<eos> A titanium briefcase.
Don't forget... I know you.<eos> You are just like me.<eos> And maybe worse... 'cause at least I'm not pretending to be something that I'm not.<eos> Is now a bad time?<eos> Dear.
What the hell are you doing?<eos> Don't you want to see what's inside?<eos> No. Absolutely not.<eos> Well, if this is leverage that... Galinda is using against Mangels, maybe it's leverage that we can use against Mangels.<eos> Fascinating.
You can stay and help us find out whose money that is, and at the end of the day, if it's free and clear, it's yours.<eos> And how are you gonna do that?<eos> Well, now that we have our files back...<eos> Wait.<eos> What?
I guess we can sneak around.<eos> Sneaking around, secret sex... that's no fun.<eos> I know, but... guess I just imagined us going grocery shopping together, holding hands in public, not having to have a gun and an escape route handy at all times.<eos> Yeah, that would be nice.<eos> For about a day.
I do trust you.<eos> I spent a year studying you, Trying to get inside your head. I know how good you are.<eos> It's why I hired you.<eos> So, why don't you tell me. Exactly what it is you want me to do, And I will do it.<eos> Anything?
All right, fine.<eos> Just make sure there's some hamachi left. By the time I get back...<eos> Darling.<eos> To everything you have achieved here, chef.<eos> What?
Comfy?<eos> Very.<eos> I got involved with some investors,<eos> Powerful people who are using me. And this restaurant as a front for their other interests.<eos> Such as?
But if the shooter is as good as we think he is, Those agents aren't going to be enough.<eos> Aerial 3 is clear.<eos> In order to catch the guy, We're going to have to mess with him first.<eos> Okay, everyone.<eos> On my mark...
The longer this thing stays open...<eos> The bigger the bust when you finally shut it down.<eos> Plus, think of all the lovely sushi. We could have in the meantime.<eos> How much time?<eos> A week.
Hey, hey. Stop.<eos> No. Don't be sorry.<eos> If I was shot at, I'd probably be dead right now. Yeah.<eos> So, the fact that you're even here is kind of amazing.<eos> What?
Thomas, I underestimated you.<eos> I get that a lot.<eos> And you want me to help you...?<eos> Disappear.<eos> For a while.
I'm worried if we wait longer...<eos> Allie, you there?<eos> He's gone.<eos> Tommy's gone.<eos> Any word?
- We have proof.<eos> Thanks to me and my rather Welles-ian camera placement, we now have our big bad on film.<eos> The thing is... she's not that big.<eos> She walks into the freezer, knows exactly where the diamonds are, grabs them, heads out the back door to her car.<eos> No.
Same goes for fashion trends, all the latest high-tech toys.<eos> He's obsessed with anything new, limited, or exclusive.<eos> - So we'll bait him.<eos> - With a dinner party.<eos> - A dinner party?
Start talking.<eos> Let's go over it again, B-team.<eos> You know I do this for a living, right?<eos> I will be disguised as Lydia Pemberton.<eos> This whole surveillance setup...
The only reason they let me go is because...<eos> You did a great job, B-team.<eos> Now all we have to do is have The Hammer send proof of death and wait for our mystery guest to appear on camera.<eos> Where are you guys going?<eos> Lunch.
- Whoa, look at you.<eos> We're going rogue, remember?<eos> I'm hosting this little dinner party.<eos> Well, that is quite an outfit you've got on there.<eos> Yeah, and quite a necklace.
Promise. Most of it. I mean, you know,<eos> I... I can explain.<eos> Where's the money?<eos> Put the gun down, Mr. Tasker.<eos> On the ground.
No.<eos> I came to give you a gift.<eos> What is it?<eos> Well, you gave me a finger... so I brought you a heart.<eos> What?
- but there were no matches.<eos> - Poor B-team.<eos> Can't you do anything without my help?<eos> Your help almost got me killed today.<eos> By a smoke bomb.
Well, how could I not?<eos> Okay, where's the money?<eos> It's in my car.<eos> Okay, but I'm gonna need some collateral, you know, to make sure you don't drive off.<eos> What kind of collateral?
How about I just come over after dinner?<eos> You always come over after, but there's never any before.<eos> - Look, all I'm saying is...<eos> - Dorothy? It's Mrs. Clifford.<eos> One time. For heaven's sake.
What's happening?<eos> A decision has been made.<eos> You are to be exiled from the Tribal Free Lands, never to return.<eos> I will take you to our border.<eos> And then what?
I can't feel my arms.<eos> You have a deep wound here.<eos> What happened to you?<eos> I don't know. I don't remember.<eos> How about your name?
That's what Ev looks like.<eos> Come on.<eos> What you waiting for?<eos> Move it, boy!<eos> What?
No one will, not anywhere, and you shouldn't ever ask again. - Why?<eos> - Because you could hang for it.<eos> It's a black elixir, it's magic.<eos> It disturbs your true nature.<eos> My true nature?
Just tell me Elizabeth was wrong.<eos> She was.<eos> But not about the timing.<eos> The Beast Forever will come when the two moons become one.<eos> And then what?
My answers were here, and now they're gone because of me.<eos> The Wizard brought your mother here. He'll have your answers.<eos> The Wizard wants me dead.<eos> Well, how much are those answers worth?<eos> Huh?
- Before scar tissue forms.<eos> - Please, stop.<eos> - You have to keep moving!<eos> - I don't want this! You should have left me in the street.<eos> Like Tip.
- And gave you a new one.<eos> One that will never break.<eos> That's where you're wrong.<eos> Today, I offer you a future.<eos> A future of hope.
One that will never break.<eos> That's where you're wrong.<eos> Today, I offer you a future.<eos> A future of hope.<eos> Of service.
- But you won't, will you?<eos> Because ever since we met, you rush into things without a care whether or not you live or die.<eos> But some of us do care.<eos> Take off your clothes.<eos> What?
A jackass?<eos> That was Tuesday. Perhaps I should be pretty?<eos> People like pretty.<eos> I think people generally prefer nice.<eos> - Mice?
Okay.<eos> It's all right.<eos> This man here has a grievance.<eos> You've lost someone. Her mother.<eos> My wife.
This man here has a grievance.<eos> You've lost someone. Her mother.<eos> My wife.<eos> We've all lost someone.<eos> Because of you.
I'm proud of you, Jack.<eos> You all right?<eos> There was a girl in here earlier.<eos> I was gonna ask you about that.<eos> About her.
This is how it's been forever.<eos> Where was your science for my wife?<eos> And this village?<eos> Will it save my future grandchild?<eos> Excellent question.
I've been hunting the owner of this sword for a very long time.<eos> If he's alive, you will deliver him to me.<eos> You're scaring her.<eos> - No!<eos> - Oh, no!
Please.<eos> And you murdered the only person who was able to.<eos> Lying to me... was a very bad idea!<eos> I would like to propose a toast.<eos> To my dear friend, August, the King of Ev.
Were you this insolent as a boy?<eos> Why don't you turn me back into one and find out?<eos> Everybody wants to be something they're not.<eos> Stop thinking you're so special!<eos> What?
From Mombi.<eos> How?<eos> Is that really you?<eos> I don't know who I am because of you.<eos> Because of me?
Leave her alone!<eos> I think we got a hero over here, hmm?<eos> You really want to be a hero?<eos> Well, you're gonna have to try a little bit harder than that.<eos> Eh? Huh?
Release him!<eos> No.<eos> Your men were right about me.<eos> I killed them.<eos> All of them.
How did you know that?<eos> We both come from the same place, don't we?<eos> Are you here to kill me?<eos> Do you know my mother, Karen Chapman?<eos> What?
When the beast forever came, you left my kingdom to drown.<eos> I want to see emerald city laid to waste.<eos> Your men were right about me.<eos> I killed 'em.<eos> All of them.
As will you.<eos> What else can you tell me about my mother?<eos> You could ask me anything you want. I owe you that much.<eos> Stay back.<eos> What?
It was...<eos> My computer malfunctioned.<eos> No.<eos> I locked you out to destroy your machine.<eos> What?
The gauntlets. They... they just did something.<eos> You can control them now.<eos> They're becoming part of you.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Like some other things too.
That's how I killed all my sisters.<eos> I took away their fear.<eos> I gave them milk of the poppy to make them forget their pain, and then I sent them out to fight.<eos> And none returned.<eos> Because of me.
But I am queen now.<eos> Okay.<eos> There.<eos> Done.<eos> What?
Yeah.<eos> A deal that saved us both.<eos> How... how could you let Sylvie love you if you knew you were leaving? How could you let me?<eos> If you're on my side, you'll stay here and keep her safe.<eos> What?
Wait.<eos> You don't have to do that.<eos> I do see you.<eos> I've lied to you...<eos> All of you...
Stay, Toto.<eos> We've come to see the Witch of the North...<eos> Sent by Elizabeth of The Wizard's High Council.<eos> Glinda knows me.<eos> Not this one.
It's sacred.<eos> As sacred as ozma was, herself.<eos> Is she dead?<eos> When the wizard defeated the beast forever, he consolidated his power by slaughtering the king and queen.<eos> And the Princess.
Me? We were born for greater things, you and I.<eos> We were born to fly.<eos> There's no way out.<eos> I've been looking for months.<eos> Twice a day.
Kill him!<eos> Wake up.<eos> Wake up.<eos> Tip, wake up!<eos> No, no.
With langwidere it's so simple.<eos> Are you going on a trip?<eos> Closing up shop.<eos> My position here has been terminated.<eos> What? On whose authority?
Of all of our sisters, you were the one destined to take her place.<eos> Did you know that?<eos> Did you know that she saw you as her heir?<eos> Not me, not east.<eos> You.
People serve a purpose.<eos> For business and for pleasure. No.<eos> We don't all exist for your benefit.<eos> You exist because Jane was paid to rebuild you.<eos> By me.
What else do we need?<eos> Supporters.<eos> Your father had many and that's who we'll recruit.<eos> Then let's go.<eos> What?
I know the only reason you have kept me alive is because my work has value to you.<eos> Tell me what you need.<eos> I-I'll make it for you now.<eos> You came here to save Langwidere.<eos> How very maternal of you.
How very maternal of you.<eos> She is just a girl!<eos> She's standing in the way of survival.<eos> Frank, you have taken everything else from me.<eos> Not this too.
But if I help The Wizard, he's gonna take me back to where I belong.<eos> And if you help me, I'll take The Wizard with me.<eos> Free magic?<eos> Yes.<eos> Free magic.
So help her to her feet.<eos> The Wizard has oppressed the magic that is your birthright... Its seeds sown into the fabric of this land.<eos> No one can take that away from you.<eos> Fight with me to rise again.<eos> To Emerald City.
To Emerald City.<eos> How many masks did you make her?<eos> - Jack... - How many?<eos> Hundreds.<eos> One for sadness.
How many masks did you make her?<eos> - Jack... - How many?<eos> Hundreds.<eos> One for sadness.<eos> For joy.
- Jack... - How many?<eos> Hundreds.<eos> One for sadness.<eos> For joy.<eos> One for rage.
Hundreds.<eos> One for sadness.<eos> For joy.<eos> One for rage.<eos> For longing.
One for sadness.<eos> For joy.<eos> One for rage.<eos> For longing.<eos> One for love.
For longing.<eos> One for love.<eos> She tried to love you, Jack, as best she could.<eos> Did you make one for this?<eos> For death?
Why did you let me live?<eos> I have a daughter of your age.<eos> When I looked down at you... I saw her looking back.<eos> I saw myself in her eyes.<eos> A murderer.
If you do, the wizard will have no reason to fight you, and you and all of your girls can live in peace.<eos> I do owe you some gratitude for protecting this girl.<eos> Even though you knew her heart was magic. Even when she turned your own kind to stone.<eos> Your love for her has never wavered.<eos> But unfortunately for you...
Five dots, a circle.<eos> Yes.<eos> I used to kiss each mark before I put you to sleep.<eos> One to keep you safe, one for good dreams.<eos> This one right here.
Sheriff called again.<eos> Needs you to come down to the station and make a statement.<eos> I don't know what to tell him.<eos> Just tell him the truth.<eos> The truth.
That's the truth.<eos> Well, when you're ready, they'll be happy to have you back at work, and you can check on Karen all you want.<eos> Your fingers.<eos> Think I'd have learned to wear gloves after all these years cracking walnuts.<eos> Walnuts.
So very close.<eos> If we can just hold this alliance together just a little longer, if we can just... will it forward just a little more...<eos> And nothing will ever be the same for anyone ever again.<eos> You and I have willed our men through unthinkable things to get this far.<eos> Why not one more?
- Reload with chain shot!<eos> - Go!<eos> Fire!<eos> Gun crews!<eos> On my mark!
I got ya!<eos> Fall, sir!<eos> We're not gonna make it!<eos> Return fire!<eos> In the wind!
There'll be debts to repay after today.<eos> And there'll be plenty of time to do it.<eos> But right now, we need to get off the sand.<eos> Where are you?<eos> What?
Don't look at me!<eos> Keep moving.<eos> You heard, move.<eos> How many others?<eos> On your knees!
Rusi, what the hell?<eos> It's a classic one-shot and I'm okay with it.<eos> People watch films, not shots.<eos> And who is the director of this film?<eos> Good question.
"..he mustn't startle Hitler.."<eos> "My lover went to England.."<eos> "..to teach them a lesson.."<eos> What's your name?<eos> Name?
Tell us the way.<eos> Tell or else"<eos> Or else" he" he'll kill you.<eos> He'll kill you.<eos> What?
You are not God, are you<eos> Farewell it is, surely not goodbye<eos> Take him to the jeep.<eos> How is she?<eos> Any serious injuries?
Malaria?<eos> Drink a tea made of cloves and cinnamon.<eos> You can escape malaria, David.<eos> But there's no escaping a case of Julia.<eos> What?
I said good good morning<eos> Good morning Good morning<eos> Blimey!<eos> On my palms he placed a golden ring<eos> Boy!
Good morning Good morning<eos> Blimey!<eos> On my palms he placed a golden ring<eos> Boy!<eos> Round and round Yes round and round
No!<eos> Never!<eos> OK, close your eyes.<eos> Two steps forward.<eos> And then a left!
Zulfi, what time is my entry on stage?<eos> I just told you.<eos> Five minutes.<eos> Double check please.<eos> Entry huh!
Tell me.<eos> I'm embarrassed about what happened in the jungle.<eos> OK.<eos> And also a little mad at you.<eos> At me?
Yes?<eos> I had something else to say too.<eos> Tell me.<eos> I want to apologize.<eos> For what?
I had something else to say too.<eos> Tell me.<eos> I want to apologize.<eos> For what?<eos> This.
That wasn't me, I was in the bathroom when"<eos> Do you smoke opium?<eos> If he falls in Paris The Eiffel Tower, will break his fall<eos> By god's grace he will be saved<eos> Blimey!
Don't worry, nothing will happen.<eos> How come?<eos> - Because I'm god.<eos> I can do anything.<eos> Like?
We're professionals, Mr. Patel.<eos> It's our job to make lies look true.<eos> Wow! Very well said!<eos> But the vicious strikes weren't false, Ms. Julia.<eos> Any wounds?
Hey, hon. I was hoping to catch you.<eos> It's my big test day, so wish me luck.<eos> Okay, love you.<eos> Ah, fuck! Fuck.<eos> Oh, God. Ah, fuck, mmm, yoga pants.
- No?<eos> - No.<eos> Fuck it.<eos> Tel Aviv, Tel Aviv.<eos> What?
Piet Mondrian's Composition No. 7, 1941.<eos> 20x26 inches.<eos> And if you pay in cash, it's 14.<eos> Million.<eos> - For this? - Mm-hmm.
Beautiful ride, ton of Ducatis.<eos> God, I'm so flattered 'cause you're crazy attractive, but I'm trying to repair my marriage right now.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Really?<eos> What?
- Fuck you!<eos> Your buddy's been dead how long?<eos> You still haven't dealt with it?<eos> He's been dead a month, Freud.<eos> - A month?
Is he in custody?<eos> Uh, we don't have anything super concrete yet.<eos> Are you joking?<eos> Allen's got a legitimate lead, and it didn't cost him a goddamn penny!<eos> What?
I'm glad you're here.<eos> We gotta run.<eos> Hey, uh, who's that woman in there?<eos> Oh, she's still here?<eos> - Thanks for everything.
Their skin?<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> That's really shallow, bro. Come on.<eos> What?
Damn it!<eos> Hey, why is he chasing you?<eos> It went sideways.<eos> Hey, where'd they go?<eos> West!
Stay in character.<eos> I'll make a hole!<eos> Roger.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - Training exercise.
Oh, shit.<eos> Ooh, Nice toes.<eos> Wait, slow down. Slower, slower.<eos> Oh, fuck.<eos> Just a little bit.
Just a little bit.<eos> I didn't know you had those.<eos> Wow, those look huge.<eos> Those look big tonight.<eos> No.
Those look big tonight.<eos> No.<eos> They always look this huge, - Officer Pantera. - Oh!<eos> - What was that sexy scream?<eos> Oh! Oh, no.
The second Brian gets out of the hospital, you, Cooper, and Hansen, you head up to Big Bear.<eos> You wait for the Brunei flight.<eos> You get the painting and get out of there.<eos> And until then?<eos> Business as usual.
- That's standard?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> Wow, things have changed!<eos> - Hey, it was great meeting you.<eos> - Hey, you too.
You have a good one. Be safe out there.<eos> Yeah, enjoy that app, right? Wow.<eos> Hi, it's Karen from SwimTech.<eos> Leave me a message.<eos> - Hey!
- Reed Junior!<eos> I used to compete against him.<eos> - Reed Junior?<eos> - That's Grieves' cousin!<eos> Grieves?
Take it!<eos> Man up, Jon!<eos> Yeah, okay. I'll do it.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> What?
Stay down, gorgeous asshole!<eos> Dude, your arm is straight up titanium, like a Terminator's arm!<eos> Yeah. I told you.<eos> Do you feel this?<eos> Uh, yeah, a little bit.
Dude, your arm is straight up titanium, like a Terminator's arm!<eos> Yeah. I told you.<eos> Do you feel this?<eos> Uh, yeah, a little bit.<eos> Like a two out of ten.
Death probably instantaneous.<eos> Has the pathologist been?<eos> No, he's probably stuck at some roadblock.<eos> That Resistance shooting caused a bit of a stink.<eos> Good teeth.
What's this?<eos> Cataracts?<eos> Was he blind?<eos> I couldn't tell you. They're not like any cataracts I've seen.<eos> Fine clothes.
For Peter's sake.<eos> What was it?<eos> Suicide?<eos> He was shot.<eos> Any idea why?
We'll keep hold of those for now, I think.<eos> What is it?<eos> That look.<eos> I've seen that a thousand times.<eos> What?
- You look like you could use it.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Well, it was a murder enquiry, but it doesn't look like I'm going to be involved.<eos> - Was it a juicy one?<eos> - Douggie!
I've never seen one quite like it.<eos> I wonder how your antique dealer carried on.<eos> How near to death by liver failure was he?<eos> I wouldn't have given him more than... two months.<eos> What about the eyes?
Busy?<eos> All these blooming' arrangements for the friendship ceremony between them and the Russkies.<eos> Maybe it's a good thing I'm borrowing you, then.<eos> Great.<eos> Plain clothes?
And you're out of touch, and that will ruin you as a copper.<eos> For Christ's sakes, Harry.<eos> What they did is no better than the bloody Nazis.<eos> So what do you believe in, Dougie? Huh?<eos> Justice.
But with those calculations they might have woken them up.<eos> I guess we'll never know.<eos> Hello, Arthur.<eos> Hello, Superintendent.<eos> Any special instructions?
And you can't trust yourself.<eos> You're wrong, Harry.<eos> You know, being Huth's man... doesn't look good to some people.<eos> You be careful out there, on the streets.<eos> Thanks for the beer.
But lawyers for Herr Hitler are denying his claims.<eos> They want to take control of the British Embassy in Washington.<eos> Good luck, Admiral...<eos> you're going to need it.<eos> Such even-handed reporting.
Don't let me detain you, then.<eos> You have a wonderful Turner there, Superintendent.<eos> Mr. Garin. Good of you to invite me.<eos> You're particularly welcome, Superintendent.<eos> Quite a melange tonight.
We've taken one by telling you as much as we have.<eos> You have nothing to fear.<eos> I think that's enough for tonight.<eos> I have to get going.<eos> Just a moment.
All those terrible people there tonight.<eos> I've seen the same sort of greedy-eyed politicians from Chaco to Addis Ababa.<eos> Brown shirts, red shirts, black shirts...<eos> They're all after the same thing.<eos> Coloured shirts?
Douglas?<eos> I think I like that better than Superintendent.<eos> So would you?<eos> Would I what?<eos> Like coffee?
We'll bring our industries here.<eos> Bosch. Siemens.<eos> Your people will be fully employed.<eos> This country will be transformed.<eos> Into what?
Somebody has to look after her.<eos> Go back to your office, Doug.<eos> Go and be with Douggie outside of the controlled area.<eos> Well, I'd be no use here, then, would I?<eos> What?
Have you got that?<eos> I'd like to have Harry Woods at my side.<eos> Hopefully Kellermann can have him released in time.<eos> Harry was involved in a shooting incident earlier today.<eos> - What? !
Of course.<eos> He took me under his wing right from the start.<eos> He believed in me.<eos> I wish I had his knack.<eos> And his bravery.
No safe opened, nothing else disturbed.<eos> Doc, could you...?<eos> Wait for the pathologist?<eos> Outside.<eos> Thanks for the tobacco.
Mom! We should go home now.<eos> I think it's dinnertime.<eos> Let's get you something to eat.<eos> What should we make?<eos> Uh, pizza.
Almost everybody.<eos> There are a few others Who are going to the other thing.<eos> How many?<eos> I'm not exactly sure.<eos> How many, about?
How much longer are we gonna beat this dead horse? Iwasjustkidding.<eos> Wait, who beats horses?<eos> nobody, honey.<eos> Hello? Mayi speak to madeline, please?<eos> Yeah, one sec.
No shorter.<eos> Yeah, they gotta stay to get paid.<eos> I will take care of it. Okay, call me when it's done.<eos> I think amabella should go to therapy.<eos> Therapy?
Thank you very much.<eos> The office is in that way.<eos> Okay.<eos> Go ahead, yeah.<eos> On the couch?
I think it should make for a splendid... oh, god.<eos> ...Evening filled with fun, Fashion, frivolity, One which should raise some much-needed funding--<eos> Going to the benefit of all our wonderful, wonderful children. Right? Right.<eos> Okay, great.<eos> Any questions?
I eventually just stopped resisting because... I was actually afraid that he would kill me.<eos> He finished... Got up, and, um... Said goodbye.<eos> And i said bye.<eos> That was it.<eos> Oh, my god.
We're talking about viciously competitive people.<eos> You really are a nutjob, you know that?<eos> Yeah, but I'm your nutjob.<eos> That's true, as opposed to...<eos> What?
Always will be. It's just difficult when you try to control me.<eos> Yeah, well, the idea of you resuming your career...<eos> I'm not trying to resume my career.<eos> I want to have another baby.<eos> - A daughter.
There's no way you could've known he was such a fucking sociopath.<eos> Fuck, yeah.<eos> Psychopath.<eos> - Dickhead.<eos> - Asshole.
A sign of a sociopath.<eos> Are we gonna make some changes today?<eos> That's right.<eos> We're gonna start with uppercuts.<eos> And one.
And one.<eos> Extend those arms.<eos> Two, one. First position.<eos> One, and serve the platter.<eos> In, out. Out.
Well, then what are we talking about?<eos> The future of the theater itself.<eos> If we piss off the mayor... and I've been told he pisses off easily...<eos> I can keep it civil.<eos> No.
It wouldn't be the first.<eos> But from my perspective, the whole point of the theater is to bring community together.<eos> You know, to entertain.<eos> To have an affirming effect on society.<eos> This thing here?
It's actually kind of annoying that you look like that and you're smart and educated and intelligent and sympathetic.<eos> You even had Cruella agreeing with you in the end.<eos> Did you see her face? I mean, come on!<eos> Yeah, thanks.<eos> What?
You hear me?<eos> I'm in love with you, Madeline.<eos> I have been... For months?<eos> So I slapped him.<eos> What?
- No.<eos> - I think we should.<eos> Should I call the tooth fairy?<eos> - No.<eos> - Or Santa Claus?
What are you carrying, darling?<eos> - I'm... - Nothing!<eos> I can check my bar.<eos> What?<eos> What?
And I wouldn't be surprised to learn that he himself is being bullied at school. Ziggy?<eos> I could be wrong, but I wouldn't be shocked.<eos> My guess is that it's verbal and that some smart kid has found his weak spot.<eos> He also brought up his father, who, believe it or not, he thinks might be Darth Vader.<eos> What?
Oh, I changed my mind.<eos> Where are the boys?<eos> They're at Judo.<eos> You knew that.<eos> What?
Like, what are you doing?<eos> Are you playing me?<eos> You know it's not over.<eos> You can't look at me 'cause you know it's true. Can you take me back, please?<eos> For... God's sakes.
- Yeah, of course.<eos> - We should be fine.<eos> Yeah, you should.<eos> - Madeline.<eos> - Oh, hi.
I'm glad to see you're feeling better.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I'm just gonna head out now.<eos> - Okay. - But good to see you, Tori.<eos> - Yeah, you, too. - Yeah.
Because you're treating us.<eos> And only you showed up, so I'm treating half the couple.<eos> From what I know about your duty of care, you are ethically responsible...<eos> I throw off the ethical chains when I sense a patient in danger.<eos> What?
From what I know about your duty of care, you are ethically responsible...<eos> I throw off the ethical chains when I sense a patient in danger.<eos> What?<eos> He hurts you.<eos> Oh, no.
Come on, old man.<eos> You still got some life in you.<eos> Hey, Skye?<eos> Guess what.<eos> What?
You saw it, too.<eos> You want to survive, you make a copy and you show someone.<eos> No one is dying because of me.<eos> I'll tell them how it works.<eos> And so what?
Julia!<eos> Hey, what happened? What happened?<eos> What happened?<eos> I saw something.<eos> The well.
Why did you put this mark on your hand?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Be careful.<eos> You hear me?<eos> So, what now?
What do you want to do today?<eos> Same thing we always do.<eos> Spatlit...<eos> What does that say?<eos> - Spotlight.
I'm not a princess.<eos> Good.<eos> Because I'm not a prince.<eos> So, uh, how long have you been sick?<eos> My whole life.
Have you ever left this house?<eos> Uh, no.<eos> Where would you go?<eos> If you could.<eos> The ocean.
You're completely gone and you barely know him.<eos> I thought you were on our side!<eos> I'm just facilitating.<eos> Do you, um, think I could see him again?<eos> In a week.
What am I supposed to do until then?<eos> When was the last time you posted a review?<eos> Hey, where are you?<eos> Skating in Venice.<eos> Oh, shit.
You shouldn't be her doctor, too. Excuse me.<eos> Is she sick?<eos> Did something happen?<eos> She went outside because of him.<eos> Because of you!
"Dancing Queen,."<eos> Yeah.<eos> She had the whole kit. And if I was inclined, what might I call you?<eos> What's today?<eos> Wednesday.
Excuse me.<eos> I'm sorry. But when you were, what was your downfall?<eos> Casinos.<eos> Bang-bang. Big time?<eos> Yeah, and some small time.
I could keep fucking you forever.<eos> Worship me.<eos> Say my name.<eos> Bilquis.<eos> - Again!
Because if you were going to leave, you could have just told me, okay?<eos> I could've taken it.<eos> You know, I had a surprise for you.<eos> I read when I was in.<eos> Mainly history.
Haven't got time for a story.<eos> Just do the fucking work, huh?<eos> Let me tell a goddamned story!<eos> I got a good one.<eos> Real good... Once upon a time...
So what's a queen to do?<eos> She gets on her knees.<eos> She takes what she don't want to, and we watch in easy fucking judgment and pretend we'd do a single thing different in her shoes.<eos> Hmm. I hear they blew up your altar.<eos> Darn.
Do I know you?<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> I think it's important for us all to remember what this day is really truly about.<eos> Which is...<eos> Oh, for Christ's sake.
Serious question, my dear.<eos> I have no doubt that millions upon millions exchange tokens and observe the rituals of your festival, all down to the hunting of the hidden eggs, but does anybody pray in your name?<eos> Do they say it in worship?<eos> Oh, they mouth your name, hmm, but they have no idea what it means. None whatsoever.<eos> Same every spring.
She doesn't want to be dead.<eos> Dead gets a bad rap.<eos> I don't want her to be dead.<eos> Reason being?<eos> Selfish reasons.
They can have it back when they pray for it.<eos> Do you believe?<eos> I believe.<eos> What do you believe, Shadow?<eos> Everything.
- Rote, sir?<eos> - Well, I was going to go with soul-sucking, but, yes, now that I'm running for President,<eos> I guess rote does sound better.<eos> Come on, guys, is this really necessary?<eos> Down!
Do you want me to take you to an emergency room?<eos> Cut... cut the "first do no harm" bullshit, okay?<eos> Alright?<eos> Who are the Sons of Liberty?<eos> Hmm?
I never wanted to do you any harm.<eos> You and countless others on a grand scale.<eos> Now you're sounding crazy.<eos> You were just a killing machine, but this project is independently funded.<eos> - The government.
Tell me the fucking truth.<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Bullshit! Goddammit, Brinn!<eos> Hodge has been chasing me all fucking day.<eos> - (GUNFIRE) - All fucking day!
What the fuck are you doing to me?<eos> Okay!<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm not your wife.<eos> - What?
Triggered to be active, kill on command now.<eos> Wow, that's fucking great, fucking great!<eos> Who the hell is Hodge?<eos> Your commanding officer, before he was recruited by SOL.<eos> Brinn?
Gabriel.<eos> He couldn't deal.<eos> PTSD.<eos> - Gabriel.<eos> - Nightmares.
Check.<eos> Do you have your cozy clothes? Got that.<eos> Can you give me a minute, Sid?<eos> We gotta pry something out of your dad.<eos> What?
All right, you guys look so wiped out.<eos> Yeah, a little. Yeah.<eos> So how long has this been going on? This... This thang?<eos> How long?<eos> Four months.
Yeah, a little. Yeah.<eos> So how long has this been going on? This... This thang?<eos> How long?<eos> Four months.<eos> Four months? Mmm.
Oh, you're gonna love this.<eos> My dad's claim to fame.<eos> He was beat by Jesse Owens in the qualifying round for the Berlin Olympics in 1936. Those are the ones where...<eos> Owens won in front of Hitler. Yeah, what a moment.<eos> What a moment.
Basketball, mostly, I guess.<eos> You an MMA fan?<eos> Dude.<eos> "Dude" what?<eos> What?
No. They didn't get a chance to jiggle shit because their head was off their fuckin' body.<eos> Yeah, they still sucked a dick, but without their heads.<eos> It was fuckin' weird, detached head shit.<eos> You know, that's Jeffrey Dahmer's business.<eos> And thanks for that image right there, man.
I think your mom got in my head, all right? I think she got in my head.<eos> Yeah, and it worked, I thought... No, it did not.<eos> It didn't work.<eos> She got in my head, and now I'm thinking all this fucked-up shit that I don't want to think about.<eos> Like what?
I can never find them.<eos> Let's do this on the move.<eos> Chris?<eos> Just get the keys. Yo.<eos> Yo, man.
Tea is disgusting.<eos> So what does it say?<eos> You will have a long life, and a happy one, with many children.<eos> That bad, huh?<eos> Any good news?
Or who you turned out not to be.<eos> - I know how it looks, but...<eos> - But what?<eos> Just get out of my way.<eos> Well?
'Paige Townsend? '<eos> Yes, no, yes, without the D.<eos> 'You got a callback for "Locked" tomorrow.'<eos> - Um, uh, wait?<eos> What?
Wanna get naked?<eos> Why not?<eos> - What?<eos> - What?<eos> What?
- No arguments here.<eos> When she says the words, I believe her.<eos> 'I can't believe I'm saying this' but did we just find our August?<eos> I think I was too over the top.<eos> Like, "Telenovela" over the top.
Sorry I'm late.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Jake got an agent.<eos> I got an assistant's card.<eos> What?
For security reasons.<eos> Because it's a company phone, but fear not.<eos> I took it upon myself to upgrade dinner.<eos> Steaks.<eos> $30 a pop!
- Just a second.<eos> Christina: Open it.<eos> You're blowing it.<eos> What are you on?<eos> You on coke?
How's your steak?<eos> It's good.<eos> Hm? Let me see.<eos> Look. At. That.<eos> Goddamn thing of beauty.
You can't let this go!<eos> No, no, 'cause we are white fucking trash, and she can't believe that she got stuck with us.<eos> And a baby, no less.<eos> You see this?<eos> $30 steak.
Where you going?<eos> Home.<eos> To do what?<eos> Uh, to do whatever the fuck it is I want to.<eos> - Hey. - Thanks for the drinks.
♪ My life is so complete now ♪<eos> ♪ Since you fell in love with me ♪<eos> ♪ Since you fell in love with me ♪<eos> You on the pill?<eos> What?
I live in your dreams.<eos> That's right.<eos> You do.<eos> There anything else about that dream you want to tell me?<eos> Like what?
You can... can have this whole place to yourself.<eos> I don't want this place.<eos> Why not?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about, man.<eos> What?
I don't want this place.<eos> Why not?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about, man.<eos> What?<eos> What?
What?<eos> What?<eos> Come on, man.<eos> Nobody wants...<eos> What?
We'll get you sorted out with the police.<eos> We'll get you under a doctor's care.<eos> You'll be back before you know it, okay?<eos> Turn right up here.<eos> What?
Right here?<eos> What're we doing?<eos> I have to show you something.<eos> Okay.<eos> What?
- Follow me. - Keith... Keith, wh...<eos> Keith, what are we doing, bud?<eos> Is this... Is this where you were?<eos> Keith, come on, man.<eos> What?
Someone! Please!<eos> Help!<eos> Hey! Hey!<eos> My sister, she needs a doctor.<eos> A doctor!
Daphne, this is our chance to shake things up!<eos> I was stuck in that hut for weeks, and I kept telling myself that when I got up, I would make every day count.<eos> So, let's stay.<eos> Let's do a year here!<eos> A year?
Of course not.<eos> What now?<eos> The clinic... it doesn't count.<eos> I'm not getting credit!<eos> What?
Oh, my God! What?<eos> I love Lil Wayne.<eos> He's my homie!<eos> Ridiculous.<eos> Absolutely ridiculous.
- What?<eos> What's your name?<eos> Oh, uh, Will Stevenson.<eos> Will.<eos> What?
Who knows?<eos> But I look around, I see a lot of people jumping out of planes hoping they're gonna grow wings.<eos> Reality and fantasy are mutually exclusive.<eos> They don't exist in the same space.<eos> What?
But then it shut down and Dad bought it.<eos> What do you think?<eos> I think it's completely insane.<eos> Well, the truth is we just needed a lot more space to house things.<eos> House what things?
Cells in a body.<eos> Waves in the ocean.<eos> The soul isn't young or old.<eos> Do you accept the fact that time is a nonlinear illusion created by man?<eos> Pass.
It was my mother's maiden name.<eos> Where is she?<eos> She's dead.<eos> How did she die?<eos> Because of my dad.
- Maybe they went someplace worse.<eos> Maybe they went someplace that we can't even begin to comprehend.<eos> All the more reason to see what your dad's machine shows us.<eos> Shit.<eos> What?
Just run away and leave me to deal with the mess.<eos> What are you doing with my body?<eos> Your body, uh, is to be cremated at noon, so, I'm getting it ready.<eos> We do still have a little time to prep a redo.<eos> Redo?
Lacey, would you join me, please?<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - It's okay. Relax.<eos> Would you like to tell us how long you've been here?<eos> Um... just over a year.
In the woods.<eos> Go on.<eos> I had a gun.<eos> And where was that gun aimed?<eos> At my chest.
He overreacted, that's all.<eos> He'll come to his senses, and, uh, Lacey will be back by tomorrow.<eos> Dad always comes to his senses.<eos> It's not a memory, Will.<eos> What?
Or it made me feel better.<eos> Anyway...<eos> Um... when I saw you walking into the water the other day, that's...<eos> That's why I was here.<eos> What?
Slow down and tell me exactly what happened.<eos> He hooked himself up to the device. He wanted to prove that it works.<eos> - Dad's hooked up right now?<eos> We need to tell him that it works.<eos> What?
You know anyone driving a black Grand Am?<eos> Force of habit. I always clock the cars on the block.<eos> I haven't seen that car before.<eos> The place I'm staying, there's some suspicion.<eos> What?
We can't leave it to chance.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> No. I never leave anything to chance.<eos> No, I got... I got an inside man.<eos> Not a man but a woman.
You want money?<eos> We're broke.<eos> No, no, no. I'm just saying.<eos> If new... new bail is granted, then, you know, maybe... maybe I... I...<eos> New bail?
- Hey, hey, hey, hey. You owe me.<eos> Bailiff: All rise.<eos> Practice your signals. - [laughing]<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - Hey. - What?
And then you get your cut.<eos> Worth every penny.<eos> Very smart play, Cousin Pete.<eos> But I was wondering if I could get that in cash - if possible.<eos> What?
Everybody!<eos> This is a robbery! Get down on the fucking floor! Get down on the fucking floor!<eos> - You! Now! - [screaming]<eos> Wait.<eos> - What?
Yes.<eos> - You sure? - Yes.<eos> Yes, yes.<eos> We'd better do the nose.<eos> What?
Something's really bugging me here.<eos> I thought things between you and me were good.<eos> I mean, you earned my trust the past few years.<eos> I gave you your freedom.<eos> And what?
- Oh, my God.<eos> You scared the shit out of me.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You're really leaving this time. Aren't you?<eos> What?
Grandma and Grandpa have one dead daughter and... another that's dead to them.<eos> No offense.<eos> Me running with their money wouldn't kill them.<eos> Well, you probably wouldn't get too far with jewelry and silverware, right?<eos> - The collateral?
What the hell, why not?<eos> There's little enough to do around here.<eos> It'll break the monotony.<eos> Oh, can I?<eos> Just for a short time.
I've got a new film coming out called "Lost Souls."<eos> - Oh, wow. - Should be out for Halloween.<eos> Another film.<eos> I have a very small role in the Coen Brothers new film "The Big Lebowski."<eos> - What else?
"I got your comeback film."<eos> I'm like, "Get the fuck outta here.<eos> Didn't think I'd be hearing from you again," and...<eos> Do you want a piece of me, you little bitch?<eos> What?
Is there life after adult films?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't think so, but...<eos> Right.<eos> Um, next question.
The lawyer said bring everything.<eos> Lawyers say a lot of things.<eos> Hey, Clay.<eos> Hey, Tyler.<eos> What?
You two are dangerous when you coordinate.<eos> You know I hate being the kind of parent who asks if you want to talk about anything, but... if you want to talk about anything...<eos> I didn't really know her, Mom.<eos> Didn't you two work together at the Crestmont?<eos> - Yeah, for a little while...
- But you didn't know her very well?<eos> Not really.<eos> I need to get to work...<eos> - Shit!<eos> - Language.
Meet the boys.<eos> Justin Foley is mine, and Zach Dempsey for you.<eos> Zach Dempsey?<eos> Really?<eos> What?
Really?<eos> What?<eos> Zach's sweet?<eos> I can't see!<eos> Not the mane!
I'm sorry about that.<eos> Geometry with Bates.<eos> No wonder you're in a hurry.<eos> - Oh, you have him, too?<eos> - Fifth period.
Porter wants to see me about Hannah.<eos> Probably about this fucking lawsuit.<eos> Did you get to first base, Justin?<eos> Get off me, I'm not saying anything.<eos> - Second?
Haven't seen one of these in a long time.<eos> What you listening to?<eos> My dad had some tapes. Um...<eos> Old music.<eos> Ultravox?
You gonna talk to her?<eos> And say what?<eos> Tell her to get her shit together.<eos> She's acting like a nut job, drawing attention to herself.<eos> And you.
And say what?<eos> Tell her to get her shit together.<eos> She's acting like a nut job, drawing attention to herself.<eos> And you.<eos> Not me.
My name is Clay.<eos> C-L-A-Y.<eos> Thank you, Theresa.<eos> Courtney Crimsen.<eos> What a pretty name.
Maybe I save my nice shit for after hours.<eos> Damn, girl, you are slick!<eos> Listen, Laura, you ever want to swing the other way...<eos> You'd be the last person I called.<eos> Right before the police.
But I decided enough was enough.<eos> I wanted to talk to you.<eos> I mean, we were in this together... weren't we?<eos> Hey. That seat's taken.<eos> Yeah, by me.
You just have to take off the tag... because...<eos> Andy.<eos> - You got a new car? - You got a new car?<eos> I upgraded the lease. It's a simple trade.<eos> - For the same payment?
Andy.<eos> - You got a new car? - You got a new car?<eos> I upgraded the lease. It's a simple trade.<eos> - For the same payment?<eos> - A bit more.
Remember Strictly Ballroom?<eos> Oh, my God, I love that movie.<eos> "There are no new steps!"<eos> You lied to me.<eos> - What?
No.<eos> I'm asking whether you knew if Hannah Baker was bullied.<eos> Why Hannah Baker?<eos> My firm was hired today by the school to defend them in the lawsuit that the Bakers have filed.<eos> Your firm?
My firm was hired today by the school to defend them in the lawsuit that the Bakers have filed.<eos> Your firm?<eos> Doesn't the school have their own lawyers?<eos> They do. But for a lawsuit, they need litigators.<eos> Like me.
U.S. History was kicking my ass.<eos> And I got help, right?<eos> What about you, dude?<eos> How's your dating life?<eos> "C" average or above?
Hoping for someone great.<eos> Why is Marcus Cole calling me?<eos> No way.<eos> It's Dollar Valentine.<eos> What?
Stupid Hannah.<eos> So, this site says that one of John Grady Cole's central flaws is... his tendency to see the world in black and white, good and evil...<eos> Sheri.<eos> Do you remember Dollar Valentines last year?<eos> What?
- What are you doing?<eos> - What? Nothing.<eos> Just...<eos> - Seriously, Marcus?<eos> - What?
Anything would have been better than sitting there thinking that somehow this was my fault.<eos> Thinking I'd be alone the rest of my life.<eos> Clay?<eos> Honey?<eos> What?
I thought I'd get you started.<eos> Your workday seems to be getting longer and longer.<eos> Any news from Clay this morning?<eos> I heard the stirrings.<eos> Some, uh... thumps and mutterings and such.
Take it easy.<eos> You'll feel better tomorrow.<eos> You were so sweet.<eos> Just like Kat said, once upon a time.<eos> So sweet.
How many of these did Daddy make you?<eos> Enough to win the election.<eos> Hey, I'll be right back, guys.<eos> Uh. What you reading?<eos> A book.
I'm over it.<eos> Okay, this... this isn't about Marcus.<eos> I never got the chance to say something.<eos> The thing is... you were the Valentine I was hoping for.<eos> What?
I just...<eos> I know you think every guy likes you because you've got this great ass.<eos> But I like you for so much more than that.<eos> Oh, my God, you're such an idiot.<eos> What?
I had chess club, I had Knowledge Bowl...<eos> See, now you're embarrassing yourself, Dad.<eos> Do you have something?<eos> Does anything bring you joy?<eos> Or just relief?
They know about your nightmares. They know you beat off to Hannah's picture.<eos> And they know what you did to her.<eos> What is it?<eos> What did I do?<eos> What?
And you said you'd come.<eos> And then you didn't.<eos> Want me to clear these?<eos> No, I'm waiting for someone.<eos> Clay?
He said, "What if I'm the bully?"<eos> That's not possible.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Your mom and I talked, and... in addition to paying for the damages to the car... we do think there needs to be some kind of... grounding situation.<eos> For at least two weeks.
Good to see our group growing a bit.<eos> As usual, we begin by reminding everyone poetry is about honest expression.<eos> And we all need to feel safe to share our deepest truths.<eos> Nice to see a friendly face.<eos> Friendly?
No, seriously, this is getting messed up.<eos> So what, are you gonna tie me up to a tree and force me to listen to the rest of the tapes?<eos> No, we're just going for a little walk.<eos> How little is little?<eos> Just up that hill.
Just come back to the library, Hannah.<eos> Come back to the poetry.<eos> Maybe.<eos> I'll take maybe.<eos> Thanks... for the journal.
Did you have a sense of how she felt about your interaction?<eos> She didn't say.<eos> But did you have a sense?<eos> Mrs. Jensen.<eos> -Lainie.
Take this, clip it on.<eos> It's chalk.<eos> Put it on your hands, like this.<eos> Or you'll slip.<eos> What?
Third grade! I was in third grade!<eos> Don't get what my grade school diaries have to do with anything.<eos> Well... First, there's a bunch of gifted child drama I won't get into.<eos> The main thing is, you have to tell the truth in poetry.<eos> Your truth.
I keep finding stones tied to my feet.<eos> Sorry, I just...<eos> Just keep going, keep going.<eos> -Jess, I...<eos> -What? -I...
Whoo! Good. Good.<eos> We're getting closer.<eos> Remember, you gotta go slow if you want to climb fast.<eos> -Oh, shit!<eos> What?
CSI and Law Order, all that.<eos> Like a... a real one.<eos> Have you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Once.
No big noise.<eos> Just cops walking around doing their jobs.<eos> Like it was nothin'.<eos> How old were you?<eos> Seventeen.
Why you cared so much about Hannah.<eos> I kept trying to figure it out.<eos> I thought maybe... I thought maybe you were in love with her.<eos> Clay... you know I'm gay, right?<eos> What?
Oh, please, don't worry about it.<eos> I have a daughter too.<eos> No wonder you're such a pro.<eos> How old is she?<eos> -Seventeen. -Seventeen.
HANNAH: Hey, Helmet.<eos> Sorry I'm late, on gum-scraping day of all days.<eos> Hope you saved some good ones.<eos> You snooze, you lose.<eos> What?
- What's the author trying to say?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Hiding my contraband.<eos> They're doing a bag check, obviously.<eos> What for?
Do you have something you want to tell us?<eos> Like who sold you the drugs?<eos> Forget it. You already think I'm lying.<eos> Look, I'm sorry, okay?<eos> About everything, all right?
You can have a seat over there.<eos> Your mom will pick you up shortly.<eos> SKYE: Mr. Ramos asked me to get more dry erasers for the white board.<eos> They suspend you?<eos> Three days.
Tough call.<eos> I'll take beer.<eos> Excellent choice, madam.<eos> Tonight, it is being served lukewarm in questionably clean cups and devoid of any flavor.<eos> - Cheers. - Cheers.
How do you know?<eos> I know.<eos> I have to give up the case. I can't take it to trial.<eos> To protect Clay?<eos> Or you and me?
I'm going on a beer run soon.<eos> - Come with me.<eos> - You're driving?<eos> Coca-Cola, my friend.<eos> Two beers, two hours ago.
What are you doing?<eos> I kind of liked the music.<eos> Did you like the music?<eos> Sheri.<eos> What?
Did you like the music?<eos> Sheri.<eos> What?<eos> I have to tell you...<eos> What?
I can't remember.<eos> Can you try?<eos> Sorry, man.<eos> Might have been stoned.<eos> - Thanks for your help.
I'm out.<eos> Bye!<eos> Shit.<eos> Hey, I saw you talking to Clay.<eos> What?
Shit.<eos> Hey, I saw you talking to Clay.<eos> What?<eos> How did you even see that?<eos> Long lenses.
Practice.<eos> We can meet up with him after.<eos> - Why aren't you at practice?<eos> - I'm still benched.<eos> Seriously?
Mrs. Cantrell, I don't know if you remember me.<eos> Clay, of course!<eos> From the night of the accident. Of course!<eos> Sheri said a Clay would be dropping by.<eos> What?
Right.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I bet you wish you hadn't invited me.<eos> She coming?<eos> What?
What the hell are you doing?<eos> - Page of cups.<eos> - You're talking about Hannah.<eos> The cards are showing someone struggling inside.<eos> Tortured. Emotionally.
I know you can't.<eos> Now I'll let you out.<eos> It's fine in here.<eos> I'll be right here if you need me.<eos> What?
Spread the word, we all need to meet in person.<eos> Did you guys get subpoenas too?<eos> Shut up!<eos> Jesus, Tyler!<eos> What?
You're gonna keep it that way.<eos> I want in, on whatever you're doing.<eos> I know more than anyone.<eos> I know a lot more than is on those tapes, and I have proof.<eos> Proof of what?
'Cause there are three people who aren't here who are likely to say whatever they want.<eos> Where are Jessica and Justin?<eos> They weren't at school.<eos> Either of them.<eos> What?
Hannah and I...<eos> Well, she was a very special girl.<eos> We had a thing, off and on.<eos> You raped her.<eos> What?
All right, come on.<eos> You're okay, you're okay.<eos> No.<eos> She wanted me.<eos> Me.
- Thanks, Dad.<eos> Good work.<eos> Matt!<eos> Matt, wake up! Matt!<eos> What?
Thought Tony might like to join us for breakfast.<eos> We can all catch up. Maybe talk about your depositions tomorrow.<eos> - That would be great.<eos> - Tony doesn't have time.<eos> Upstairs.
Remember how side "B" was blank?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's not blank anymore.<eos> She wanted me.<eos> Me.
Someone made this stupid list.<eos> "Best of, worst of" thing.<eos> And people have been reacting to it ever since.<eos> When was the last time?<eos> A week ago.
Well, Dennis, without the tapes in evidence, I'd suggest we move on.<eos> Hello?<eos> Miss Davis, it's important that you speak only to what you actually experienced.<eos> So, you and Hannah were friends?<eos> Yeah. For a while.
But this is a meaningful assurance that the pirate threat is no more.<eos> You asked for a governor I would call husband.<eos> I cannot give that to you either.<eos> But I have given you a candidate whose trustworthiness I can guarantee.<eos> What candidate?
I just don't really fancyending up standing in front of some bloke I've been on three dates with in my bra and knickers.<eos> That bit never bothers me.<eos> What? You in your bra and knickers?<eos> Evening. Evening, sir.<eos> Which way?
Just go over the bridge...<eos> Because you want to watch EastEnders, or because wanna go out, or...?<eos> Because you're feeling sick?<eos> I'm always feeling sick, fucktard.<eos> On account of the cancer.
Cos that looks like a bloke's watch.<eos> Let me get everything back to my lab. We'll get the remains out, clean them up and see where we are.<eos> Yeah. Call me when you're ready.<eos> Thanks, Fran.<eos> Popular picnic spot apparently.
In here.<eos> Hey, love.<eos> How'd it go?<eos> Fine.<eos> What?
Paul... that is so kind of you.<eos> He'll be OK.<eos> He's a cracking lad.<eos> Someone will see that one day.<eos> On three.
I'm guessing... a kitchen knife?<eos> The handle's maybe rotted away or perhaps even snapped off at the time of entry.<eos> Right. So, there are blade marks on the fourth and fifth left side ribs here. And here.<eos> All of which is consistent with a fatal stab wound to the chest.<eos> To the heart?
See if they can help.<eos> OK, thanks, Fran.<eos> Hi. I'm looking for Nathan.<eos> Yep, that's me.<eos> Right. Blimey.
One time, this time.<eos> Yes?<eos> Say yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> And the guns. And the guns.
♪♪ I'm Negan.<eos> Daryl isn't like you.<eos> He's... emotional.<eos> So he's either on his way home, or he's coming back here to try to kill some more of us.<eos> Mostly you and me.
Oh, yeah.<eos> We're gonna need batteries for that walkie, too.<eos> What is it?<eos> What's that smile? Couple of days out, all we got to show are two guns, dented cans of beans, and some football jerseys, pretty much.<eos> Pretty much.
Oh, yeah, you do.<eos> You see that?<eos> Rick: It's guns like that. That's why we're out here.<eos> [Shell casings clink] Something serious happened here.<eos> A long time ago.
- 10.<eos> - 6.<eos> - 10. - 9.<eos> And the cat back.<eos> 20.
Answer... we don't.<eos> My brother pissed someone off, get himself killed?<eos> Something like that.<eos> Very, very ugly stuff.<eos> My condolences.
♪♪ Please help me!<eos> You okay?<eos> He hasn't killed one before.<eos> He's learning. That's not what he told us.<eos> Thanks for the help.

We didn't come here to hurt anybody.<eos> Cyndie, give it here.<eos> Now. Natania, just talk to Rick.<eos> Shut up.<eos> [Panting]
And we start once more for the fallen... for the Kingdom...<eos> Ezekiel: for the glory of victory.<eos> Ho!<eos> What you fight for. Not the place...<eos> the people, each other.
These guys are real, okay?<eos> And they love the sport, and they have money, and they have a plan, and I want Ryan to be a part of it.<eos> Just promise me... just don't do anything with the UFC until you let me make my pitch.<eos> When?<eos> Monday.
Just promise me... just don't do anything with the UFC until you let me make my pitch.<eos> When?<eos> Monday.<eos> I promise.<eos> - Monday?
No.<eos> No, no, no, no. Pass, whatever it is.<eos> I got to find Nate.<eos> He's... He's up soon.<eos> Hey, hey, hey! What?
Thank you.<eos> It's all good.<eos> How was the audition?<eos> Really good.<eos> Yogurt.
Why?<eos> It feels empty?<eos> You know want to know what's better than winning a trophy?<eos> A blowjob.<eos> A belt.
Relax. Relax.<eos> - Just flick it.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> So, if I'm getting out of the way of that right...<eos> Sweet right.
We can't fall asleep with her.<eos> I won't.<eos> I think we should baptize her.<eos> Why?<eos> Just in case.
I won't.<eos> I think we should baptize her.<eos> Why?<eos> Just in case.<eos> Just in case.
I got to feel my full range of emotions, you know?<eos> I got to be who I was.<eos> Fuck. Fuck.<eos> Ryan, this is what happens when you don't help me with these.<eos> And I...
Is this where I do my shows?<eos> Sometimes.<eos> Terry said I'm doing one tonight, so I'm so fucking excited.<eos> Have you, uh, ever done VIP?<eos> Yeah, like, all the time.
- Yes, it is, Dan.<eos> - I don't... I don't see it.<eos> - Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan. - I don't... I don't see it.<eos> - I don't see it, dude. I don't...<eos> - Dan, Dan. What?
Yes!<eos> Come on. Come on.<eos> Come get it.<eos> Before the evening commences...<eos> What?
I'll put you through the window, you cunt.<eos> - Ahh! - All right, we're gonna break something.<eos> I can't afford to replace anything.<eos> All right, on three, we're gonna let each other go.<eos> On three, on three.
Ahh! You cocksucker.<eos> No, seriously, seriously, seriously.<eos> Seriously.<eos> I got a stomachache.<eos> On three.
I want to fight Hughes, that fucking farm boy.<eos> I got a score to settle with him.<eos> He's tough.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So what?
Jesus.<eos> Relax.<eos> Hey. What's up?<eos> Man, you got a problem.<eos> What?
Fucking idiot.<eos> Hi.<eos> This is Jay Kulina.<eos> Fuck.<eos> What?
No, please.<eos> Don't.<eos> Amy, he's trying to be generous.<eos> It's gross, Jay.<eos> What?
He called me out.<eos> And now it looks like the guy's having cold feet.<eos> The dude's still a head case.<eos> Okay, well, anybody else?<eos> Next question.
So is Garo.<eos> Good.<eos> I hope they turn all fuckin' purple and sweaty.<eos> Can you stop?<eos> To you.
I hope they turn all fuckin' purple and sweaty.<eos> Can you stop?<eos> To you.<eos> Come on.<eos> To you.
This piece of fuckin' cornbread.<eos> He goes to bed at 8:00 every night with a glass of milk in his hand.<eos> He drives a fucking tractor.<eos> I am Sid fuckin' Vicious compared to this Cub Scout.<eos> Any other thoughtful questions?
Give me some Xanax.<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> How many do you want?<eos> Two.<eos> Eight.
Yeah.<eos> Hey. You okay?<eos> Am I okay?<eos> Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> Why?
Do all you guys think this way?<eos> What... What are these?<eos> Pinched a nerve.<eos> Bad.<eos> What?
I just met him.<eos> Did he at least take you someplace nice?<eos> Yeah, it's okay.<eos> He a white boy?<eos> What?
Hey, no.<eos> She was put in your life for a reason.<eos> You love her, right?<eos> Very much.<eos> Why?
What happened?<eos> You took the bullets out of my gun.<eos> It felt real.<eos> Good night, Alvey.<eos> 24...
Get the fuck off me.<eos> Get the fuck off me.<eos> Come on, man.<eos> Give me a fuckin' break.<eos> What?
Prayers sent for brother Keith.<eos> Let us pray.<eos> I believe in God... the Father Almighty, creator of Heaven and Earth and Jesus Christ, His only son...<eos> Move the head.<eos> High for the fence.
Hey, wait.<eos> Nate got offered a fight.<eos> CFL.<eos> - When?<eos> - Saturday.
You get that... get that tuneup.<eos> Get right with God, you know.<eos> Yeah, I guess so.<eos> What the fuck you smiling at?<eos> What?
Work the body.<eos> Nice.<eos> Take a shot!<eos> Here we go. Here we go. Up!<eos> Up! Up! Up!
Nice.<eos> Take a shot!<eos> Here we go. Here we go. Up!<eos> Up! Up! Up!<eos> Up! Up! Up!
- You're in charge.<eos> - And no one can know about it.<eos> Great.<eos> I don't know how long that's gonna be for.<eos> What? Hey!
- And no one can know about it.<eos> Great.<eos> I don't know how long that's gonna be for.<eos> What? Hey!<eos> What?
I waited so that you could say goodbye.<eos> You're not driving tonight.<eos> Hold your daughter, Jay.<eos> We're leaving.<eos> What?
How bad I treated you.<eos> I know I put that needle in your arm, Christina.<eos> I know I did.<eos> I have to go.<eos> - Thanks for the wine.
- Those fucking morons.<eos> Hey, can we get some wet paper towels down here, please?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey, we have someone in common.<eos> Alvey Kulina?
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> - Come here. I need you to help me with something.<eos> Shut the door.<eos> - What is that?<eos> - Toradol.
No, I never murdered anybody at work.<eos> You're a very docile man, Mac.<eos> I like that about you.<eos> Cheers.<eos> To the day.
You're a very docile man, Mac.<eos> I like that about you.<eos> Cheers.<eos> To the day.<eos> To us.
Shelby hasn't made any responses to your overtures.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - No, sir.<eos> What is she waiting for?<eos> The second fucking kid?
It's fine.<eos> Why was Dom here?<eos> Just hanging out.<eos> Why? You know I suspended him, right?<eos> Yeah, for the protein powder thing.
I'm getting sick of this.<eos> Fuck!<eos> Not... not...<eos> No, no, no, no. Not you.<eos> Not... not... not this.
Let's... let's get it the fuck out of here.<eos> You're gonna love this.<eos> You're gonna not regret having taken it, Mac.<eos> I'm telling you.<eos> What?
No, I'm not talking about that shit.<eos> Okay, let's go back up here.<eos> Dom.<eos> Can we fucking move somewhere?<eos> Yeah, yeah, in the back.
It's so fucking crazy.<eos> Is this where Nate's fighting?<eos> It's gonna be big.<eos> Come on.<eos> What?
This is fucking your fight.<eos> Don't fuck this up.<eos> Ready?<eos> Fight!<eos> Again! Again!
- You're welcome.<eos> Now I'm getting a little tired of beating up Joe and Juan.<eos> I could use another body if you wanna come spar, maybe, take your mind off shit.<eos> Well, I have to find a job.<eos> A job.
Yeah.<eos> Maybe.<eos> I'll play it by ear.<eos> All right.<eos> Thanks for the drink.
If it isn't us.<eos> You know the worst part about inventing teleportation?<eos> Suddenly, you're able to travel the whole galaxy, and the first thing you learn is, you're the last guy to invent teleportation.<eos> Fortunately, you're about to invent something much more powerful.<eos> What?
That's pretty obvious from the haircuts.<eos> So do what you want to me, but let my brother go.<eos> He already renounced Rick.<eos> Morty?<eos> What?
Sounds important.<eos> If you're looking for our kids, your father did a-a portal, uh...<eos> Okay.<eos> Loser.<eos> What?
W love the radiation, the trichinosis.<eos> We're in it for life, which I assume is around 20 years, average.<eos> I just need a quick aside with my grandkids, about 40 yards from anyone else.<eos> Hey, the Green Rock is gone!<eos> - Oh, no!
Who else wants some?<eos> Who wants to be my pussy of a dad today?<eos> Hey, what's...<eos> What's wrong, man? You're not getting weak on me, are you?<eos> What?
Yeah, except I'm the only one in this entire world that's still committed to that! Ohh.<eos> Ding, ding, ding! Wow.<eos> Everybody hear that? Wow.<eos> - Uh, we should go to the garage.<eos> - Oh, my God. - Uh-huh.
Come on, Morty.<eos> No union built on running from your problems lasts more than five years, seven tops.<eos> Grandpa just sped things up with a few creature comforts of modern society.<eos> Hemorrhage and I are taking some time apart.<eos> Oh, no.
Morty, Mom's talking.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I suppose that's a good segue into our little discipline cases here.<eos> Does Grandpa turn himself into a pickle a lot?<eos> What?
Well, have fun with that, but Morty and I have to meet a Lady Comet, a Monorail Man,<eos> Two Assholes, and a Full Alligator in like an hour.<eos> Shit.<eos> I sense the presence of a greater evil.<eos> Check, check. One, two. Okay.
Do not threaten her.<eos> Congrats, you did it.<eos> What the hell is "Israel"?<eos> It-It's just something Rick starts talking about when he's blackout drunk.<eos> W-What?
Too many, Rick!<eos> Too many!<eos> Man, I am really getting high-roaded today.<eos> That's a three pointer.<eos> Nice shot.
He said it's the part of the Vindicators he values.<eos> That means nothing.<eos> He wants our last moment alive to be spent knowing how few fucks he gave.<eos> Jesus!<eos> Okay, open to second opinions.
I notice stuff like that.<eos> It's always in the basement.<eos> It's like... its own elevator.<eos> And... how does that make you feel?<eos> Huh?
So...<eos> Are you getting high?<eos> No.<eos> Oh shit.<eos> Ah hell.
Not money.<eos> Just taking back what's mine.<eos> The stamp.<eos> I told you that, how he bamboozled me out of a fortune and I just...<eos> All these years I just...
I love you.<eos> Baby you have no idea.<eos> Yes I hear the sirens.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Back stairs.
People need the kick it gives them to feel alive.<eos> He was taking animal sedative.<eos> Anything else?<eos> What? No...<eos> Just drugs...
Fortitude police need to ask him some questions...<eos> Is he in some kind of trouble?<eos> No... I need to ask...<eos> What's the flight time from Kinshasha to Oslo?<eos> What?
- Sit down.<eos> Answer the fucking question.<eos> Sit. Down.<eos> I knew Laszlo Hindemith.<eos> What?
- The "demoniacal cacophony" he said.<eos> "Childrens' voices".<eos> They die in the hands of cannibals.<eos> "The demon's jaws".<eos> Stuff like that.
So this is a typical predator behaviour.<eos> This isn't it happening again, this isn't what your so frightened of.<eos> I know what you think.<eos> This isn't it!<eos> What?
Child labour, mass executions, there are reports of cannibalism.<eos> Eric I, I don't see...<eos> The barman says he spoke of it.<eos> Hindemith?<eos> All the time.
This isn't how it's done.<eos> - I'm trying.<eos> - I know you're trying!<eos> I have to tell you something.<eos> What?
You don't mess with that stuff.<eos> We used to mess with everything else.<eos> This is a very serious trip.<eos> It can go very wrong.<eos> And then?
It was all good.<eos> - Happy?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> So you took his head.<eos> As a souvenir?
I'm sorry about before.<eos> I, I overreacted and it was, undignified and unscientific.<eos> Yeah.<eos> When I was a kid, I wanted to be a magician.<eos> What?
Eric, I need you to focus now.<eos> The town has been through terrible things.<eos> It needs to get back to normal.<eos> Ingrid? Yes, what?<eos> What?
The town has been through terrible things.<eos> It needs to get back to normal.<eos> Ingrid? Yes, what?<eos> What?<eos> What?
What?<eos> What?<eos> Call Petra in.<eos> I'll meet you there.<eos> What?
- Buff up your resume.<eos> - I'm middle-aged!<eos> It's a bureaucrat's best years.<eos> I'm unemployable!<eos> So what?
No, I don't think I can.<eos> I don't think I love Eric anymore.<eos> Oh, you are so fucking competitive.<eos> It doesn't matter how bad my shit is, yours is always gotta be worse. Doesn't it?<eos> - Bullshit!
- Where's her head? - It's gone.<eos> I can see that.<eos> Then why did you ask?<eos> We think it's been taken.<eos> Like the other one.
What will you do when you sell the boat?<eos> Freya's sick.<eos> She's real sick.<eos> There's no cure.<eos> What?
That's something.<eos> Go round the back!<eos> Rune!<eos> Tavrani's tongue was cut out.<eos> What?
Please put the light on.<eos> It's okay. I'm here.<eos> You're here, there's nothing else...<eos> Please put the light on.<eos> What?
I don't.<eos> Especially the recent test results.<eos> Good morning, Eric.<eos> Everything okay with you and Hildur?<eos> What?
The taxidermist?<eos> We can't be sure of that.<eos> But the taxidermist killed the geologist.<eos> We're not ruling that out.<eos> - But not the shop girl?
Just now.<eos> In your dream.<eos> You called me.<eos> You summoned me up from the world of the dead.<eos> What?
Do you have any pains in your left lower back at all?<eos> My left lower back?<eos> It's where the human liver is located.<eos> No. All good.<eos> What about the abdomen, generally?
Good night.<eos> Now, I feel really bad.<eos> I had such a lovely time.<eos> Good night.<eos> What?
And you just killed one of the governor's men.<eos> Now write that.<eos> I killed who?<eos> Killed him.<eos> What?
It could have been you.<eos> I gave you... both of you, a place to stand here.<eos> I gave you a life, and you repaid me by conspiring with my enemies.<eos> Ma'am, I don't know what you think you heard, but...<eos> Quiet.
It is far from a foregone conclusion that they'll be inclined to offer me their help.<eos> But, given our state of affairs, it seems more than worth a try.<eos> And unlike in the past... I now have something to offer them that may make the ask more attractive.<eos> What's that?<eos> You.
So, between that and the ordinance we just scavenged, we may be better supplied than the British in Nassau at this moment.<eos> That said, the strangest thing just happened out by the slave quarters.<eos> The doors were locked... from the inside.<eos> How did you know that?<eos> What?
The answer to a question I did not yet know how to ask.<eos> I told him... that there were men in the east... who would have seen in that bird the darkest of all omens, bringer of death.<eos> But then, there are other men near Clifton... my... my mother's home... who would've called it a sign of great fortune, an indication from the heavens that someone up there favored our endeavor together.<eos> And I asked him what he thought it meant.<eos> "Dinner."
- Bye, Tom. - Bye.<eos> You know, I've actually been trying to figure out a way to impress you for a while now.<eos> I just haven't had my chance.<eos> You... you're straight?<eos> What?
Sometimes they don't.<eos> Kelly, can I just have a moment, please? Yeah, of course.<eos> Max.<eos> Come here.<eos> What?
You're a very big person.<eos> Sorry, just one minute, please.<eos> Come on, really? Are you serious?<eos> We paid for it. Help yourself.<eos> - Cheers. - Right, cheers.
Eventually, we'll need to garner support to help incite Nassau to revolt against the governor, but what we need right now is information.<eos> How many soldiers there are, what kind of sympathy exists for our cause.<eos> I know.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - What for?
- Billy.<eos> - Yep.<eos> - Tried to kill you?<eos> - Yep.<eos> - And Madi?
- Yep.<eos> - Tried to kill you?<eos> - Yep.<eos> - And Madi?<eos> - Her, too.
I feel like we need as much help as we can... get.<eos> Execution of the pirate prisoners is scheduled for today.<eos> Captain Berringer stood in the square and said if Long John Silver had a problem with this, he was welcome to show himself and voice it.<eos> Even if we could get through their outer defenses, 10 of us walk into town against what could be 100 soldiers.<eos> And then what?
Pull!<eos> Pull it away!<eos> Hold him.<eos> Again.<eos> Again.
Again.<eos> Heave!<eos> - Heave! - Get it out!<eos> Him next.<eos> Again! Again!
Look, no offense, all right, but, uh, my wife made me come here.<eos> And I don't really believe in any of this shit.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, you already paid, so you might as well hear what I got, man.<eos> So, what?
Well, divine intervention.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> You know, like karma or kismet, whatever.<eos> You know?<eos> What?
You gotta talk.<eos> Talking helps.<eos> You killed someone?<eos> Yeah.<eos> A, um... a woman.
I'm not, um...<eos> I can die.<eos> Of course you can.<eos> Just not here.<eos> What?
Well, we can't just be going through all of this for nothing, man.<eos> You're going through this because your daughter died.<eos> We don't know that!<eos> We don't know that.<eos> What?
We talked about this.<eos> It's for his own good.<eos> A man like that, used to blaming others for his...<eos> Maybe I should just give him the stamp.<eos> To what end?
Not last I heard.<eos> Maybe just a vitamin deficiency.<eos> My point is, I'm already primed for...<eos> And then this fella comes in...<eos> - "Fella" singular?
- Hi. Are you here for the convention of Santa Claus?<eos> Why do you...<eos> No. I'm not.<eos> By the hour then, or...<eos> - What? - Nothing.
All right.<eos> Look, I'm just gonna cut to the chase here, gorgeous.<eos> Am I getting laid tonight or what?<eos> Cool.<eos> Thanks for the beer.
We should maybe drive up there after Arby's.<eos> Dead, apparently.<eos> The... Who?<eos> Suspect.<eos> LeFay. Some kinda freak accident.
--Sorry.<eos> No, that's...<eos> Everybody has a first day.<eos> Would you get the man a cream soda, for shit's sakes? Jeez!<eos> Thanks again for those Gopher seats.
Well, don't keep me in suspense.<eos> The stamp wasn't there, but I got this.<eos> Christmas.<eos> How much did he have, his account? I don't know.<eos> Uh, maybe $1 million.
You wouldn't...<eos> Friend.<eos> You wouldn't have a putter-inner by chance?<eos> How's that?<eos> Or a pad?
A girl like that, and she loves me.<eos> We're getting married.<eos> We got plans, big plans.<eos> Not if we revoke her. Now, hold on just a...<eos> Consequences, Mr. Stussy.
Our what?<eos> He means the crapper.<eos> Emmit.<eos> It's just down the hall on your right-hand side.<eos> What?
No, my friend, I'm sorry.<eos> You're in the pan, and you know where you go when you leave the pan.<eos> -The... -The frying pan.<eos> You know where you go when you leave.<eos> -Into the fire. -Yeah.
A Humvee in a restaurant parking lot, -two other vehicles involved. -Hmm.<eos> So I run the plate number on the Hummer, and it's registered to a corporation in Saint Cloud, a company car.<eos> Seems like you're crossing all the T's. Not sure how it's...<eos> Well, okay, then. So, after I see you in the commode, I go see this fellow that works there, and something strikes me odd.<eos> The name.
Emmit, are you gonna...<eos> The point is, Stussy Lots Ltd. Are in the process of securing $50 million in new loans.<eos> Now, we're gonna use that money to buy 16 more lots, after paying some healthy bonuses to the partners, of course.<eos> You're talking about doubling the size of the company in six months?<eos> - Three months.
Yes, sir, that's my case. Uh, victim ran a grocery store in Eden Valley about 30 miles south of here, Ennis Stussy.<eos> I read that in The Tribune, the old fella.<eos> What'd he die with, again?<eos> His mouth and nose were glued shut.<eos> Christmas.
Well, now, Emmit... I know, I know.<eos> That's not the plan. But...<eos> Thanks.<eos> Heck, you don't get where I am by sticking to the plan.<eos> - To new friends. New friends.
Heck, you don't get where I am by sticking to the plan.<eos> - To new friends. New friends.<eos> He's dead, in case you couldn't tell.<eos> Lady cop who printed you said you're a little tender.<eos> Around the middle, maybe?
Or maybe you think I'm your conscience.<eos> How's that story, the Ghost of Christmas Past?<eos> I...<eos> You came back for a reason, I'm thinking.<eos> The gun.
Is the version I heard.<eos> You can see why I'm usually the negotiator.<eos> There's something... You've got a...<eos> That's just... Must be some red wine from lunch. Mmm.<eos> Any more questions on the business?
You're gonna need to get Chief Muderlack's<eos> John Hancock on one of these babies, then I'll give you the yellow one, and then when that's filled, you get the blue.<eos> My lawyer here?<eos> Turn around and put your hands through the bars.<eos> Why?
What's happening? Is that... - No.<eos> - Easy, son.<eos> Put the syringe down, on the floor, slowly.<eos> - He was doing something. - Quiet.<eos> On the floor.
- ♪ ...and join the chorus ♪ - Crap.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> What's the plan?<eos> Where are we going?<eos> What?
You bitch!<eos> No. No way.<eos> No. No.<eos> You want shoes?<eos> What?
I think you're beginning to understand that.<eos> Amen.<eos> Can I show you something?<eos> Ray is the cat.<eos> What?
Don't worry.<eos> Hey, do me a favor, will you?<eos> When the Gophers play, put a little beer in a bowl and put it in front of the game.<eos> Napkins.<eos> And some vodka.
It would be a shame to let it all go to waste.<eos> Think of all them starving children.<eos> No?<eos> What about some tea then, eh?<eos> Fancy a nice cuppa?
Well, that's not right.<eos> Oh, Jeez. Call 911!<eos> Make a hole, guys.<eos> Stay with us.<eos> Almost there.
Meemo will be over presently to take you home.<eos> There's some papers to sign.<eos> You're selling a shopping mall.<eos> I own a shopping mall?<eos> What?
That would make me your competitor, and, as my late husband always used to say,<eos> "You don't want a Goldfarb for an enemy."<eos> - I'm sure that's true. - Mmm.<eos> It's interesting that you should come to us now. Problems?<eos> No, not problems.
Forty grand.<eos> That, plus the 10 you stole, puts it 50.<eos> My thought, then, is you should leave the state.<eos> Two hundred. And we want the stamp.<eos> For what?
What's the matter, buddy?<eos> You drank from the holy cup, but here you are. Not being a good boy.<eos> This isn't that. I'm sorry.<eos> Who are you?<eos> What?
So I hide the ball and he pulls in.<eos> Not out of the car ten seconds, when down he goes, flat on his face.<eos> One minute, he's waving hello, the next, just drops like... Like the lights go out.<eos> I killed him.<eos> -Your dad?
One stamp left.<eos> I sold the rest and used the capital to get things rolling, but I kept the two-cent, hung it on the wall of my study.<eos> Like it was my first dollar I ever made.<eos> But think of it from his point of view, my brother.<eos> Like a stick in the eye, every time he...
What do we got?<eos> Victim's a white male, late fifties.<eos> Wife found him in the kitchen.<eos> Jesus.<eos> Prints?
Right.<eos> I got a whole speech I could make.<eos> Oh, please don't.<eos> Here's what I think you need.<eos> -Why?
Oh, please don't.<eos> Here's what I think you need.<eos> -Why?<eos> -I wanna show you somethin'.<eos> What?
This Varga fellow plucked you like a chicken.<eos> But he's gone now.<eos> So, I'm gonna finish the job.<eos> Please, wait, I got...<eos> What?
You can't believe that.<eos> It's true.<eos> It's true whether I believe it or not.<eos> Did you kill him?<eos> Emmit?
You believe in nothing so you have nothing.<eos> You are on a path... from nothing to everything.<eos> You had something recently.<eos> You lost it.<eos> - My... my wife.
You are on a path... from nothing to everything.<eos> You had something recently.<eos> You lost it.<eos> - My... my wife.<eos> - Not your wife.
Well, let me remind you.<eos> What have you done?<eos> I can taste you on the rain.<eos> What else can I taste?<eos> War.
I do not grant wishes.<eos> This is the bank I'll be robbing, so let's go say hello.<eos> Are you outta your goddamn mind?<eos> Have a little faith, son.<eos> Hell, no.
Now they've got a testing process that's proven unreliable in court.<eos> Forget about a trial, this thing won't even make it through evidentiary.<eos> You haven't heard the bad news.<eos> They have a witness.<eos> What?
Kay.<eos> Most people wait until they get home.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hope you burn, piece of shit.<eos> - Asshole.
Do you know him?<eos> No, I'm just not quick to judge.<eos> I guess it's the Christian in me.<eos> So, who's the lucky family?<eos> The Stolnjaks.
Right along the same time people are going to be deciding whether to re-elect Robert Boston, and you'll be all over TruTv, trying to explain why you had Toby Clay bring in a cop for questioning.<eos> That dead cop.<eos> I get you a name, and you do what?<eos> No witness, no trial.<eos> Not like that.
Decided credit cards were evil.<eos> Still smells like him.<eos> Didn't P.J. give this to you for your birthday?<eos> I thought I lost that.<eos> About two years ago.
Your big night here is, what?<eos> The Voice?<eos> Couple of boxes of wine?<eos> Crys? That's how easy it is.<eos> What?
I hope someday that... You can forgive me.<eos> It's not 'cause I don't love you.<eos> It's because I do.<eos> You deserve a good family.<eos> A good daddy.
My God, yeah.<eos> When I fell in the toilet.<eos> Wait, what happened?<eos> - Ask her.<eos> - For God's sake.
She was trying to pull a P.J.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> It was a long time ago.<eos> You know, ach. But pills.<eos> What?
No, no, no.<eos> We're here now.<eos> We are here and I would like to know.<eos> Did you ever once stop to think about how it would affect my sisters or me?<eos> You?
I guess we're even.<eos> Jesus.<eos> Neither one of us can apologize worth a shit.<eos> Hey. They expelled Denise.<eos> What?
Uh, it was quite a bit of money.<eos> Uh, no, it was a misunderstanding.<eos> It doesn't have to be.<eos> Uh, could I have some of that money?<eos> - Oh... - For the church?
We'll keep this thing squashed.<eos> Dad, hold on.<eos> Toby gave him 24 hours.<eos> - We should use the time.<eos> - For what?
You didn't fail PJ.<eos> He was brilliant and brave.<eos> No, no, Denise is the brave one.<eos> Where do you think she got it from?<eos> Passionate.
What about him?<eos> We're mates. We studied together.<eos> That surprises me.<eos> A cultured man like yourself...<eos> What?
I wanted to be a lawyer.<eos> I see you're from a good family.<eos> This desert is bigger than it looks.<eos> In those boots, you won't even reach the enemy.<eos> - What?
This desert is bigger than it looks.<eos> In those boots, you won't even reach the enemy.<eos> - What?<eos> - Don't you ever knock?<eos> Too risky.
Tired, Trini.<eos> I want to leave this world, or get married, and read fairy tales.<eos> - Why don't you then?<eos> - No woman could love me.<eos> You?
She loaned it to the regiment.<eos> Stop being modest.<eos> You got it.<eos> I was left frustrated.<eos> What?
You're a big boy now.<eos> You suddenly seem much older.<eos> I'm so happy to have you both here.<eos> - Guess what he wants for Christmas.<eos> - What?
Come in!<eos> I propose a toast.<eos> Here's to our wives, who, thanks to the Captain, are with us for this special night.<eos> Yes.<eos> To our wives!
Cigars from the Lady of the Manor.<eos> And this is especially for you.<eos> I don't know what it is.<eos> A sack of spuds.<eos> What nice boots.
Why should I believe you, when you've lied to me?<eos> - You know all about lying.<eos> - What? You've betrayed me.<eos> It's the Carlana's horse. You're her lover.<eos> - What?
- You're wrong.<eos> You owe me.<eos> What do I owe you?<eos> Some compensation.<eos> For what?
Try me.<eos> And the rest.<eos> How old was I when my father did this?<eos> Four.<eos> And this?
What do you want?<eos> - It's Ramonet.<eos> - What about Ramonet?<eos> He has diphtheria.<eos> What?
I stand by what I said.<eos> I'll get you the antiserum, on one condition.<eos> What's that?<eos> That you kill Soleràs.<eos> What?
I'm sorry, Lluís.<eos> I couldn't get anything.<eos> What will you do?<eos> - I've taken steps to get some.<eos> - What steps?
- I've taken steps to get some.<eos> - What steps?<eos> The Carlana will give it to me.<eos> The Carlana?<eos> In exchange for what?
- Room service.<eos> - What?<eos> James Bagwell.<eos> Remember me?<eos> Shit.
- Right?<eos> - Yeah. Only way to learn the business.<eos> It's my old boss.<eos> This could get ugly.<eos> One second.
Needs to be fucking babysat.<eos> Not part of my job description.<eos> Is there a problem?<eos> Yeah, matter of fact.<eos> - Why?
I don't remember.<eos> It was Daddy's.<eos> That's right.<eos> That came from Mr. Metzger's family.<eos> Why?
Well, Liz, we were walking home from school today, and my daughter found the most adorable little calico kitten you've ever seen in your life.<eos> I don't have to tell you how little girls are with kittens, right?<eos> - Darcy has a kitty. - Well, then you know exactly what I'm talking about.<eos> Anyway, this little guy was hit by a car.<eos> - No.
You remember what it was like... that green, that shade of green.<eos> It was the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen.<eos> And the tire swing.<eos> It used to break every summer, and every summer Grandpa would fix it.<eos> And the apples.
- I'm sorry.<eos> I had no idea. It's not...<eos> Where's my phone?<eos> Taylor, can you take me to the train station? What...<eos> For what?
That whole story about going to the store for diapers.<eos> What the fuck is wrong with this family?<eos> - A little help. - Be right there.<eos> NYPD.<eos> Cool cats.
For what that's worth.<eos> I should have shot you the other day. He said you were an intruder.<eos> I understand. Listen.<eos> You remember the address that Audrey gave you on the phone this morning?<eos> Why? What about it?
I just want them dead.<eos> I never did say it, but thanks.<eos> For getting me off Eros.<eos> I wouldn't have made it without you.<eos> Thanks for the lift.
I never did say it, but thanks.<eos> For getting me off Eros.<eos> I wouldn't have made it without you.<eos> Thanks for the lift.<eos> And the cancer.
I lost count at 40.<eos> Travis can't hide from earth by putting on that martian armor.<eos> His bones are all wrong from growing up in full g.<eos> We'll keep him anyway.<eos> - Hey!
Yeah, we've all been a wreck.<eos> (Claps) All right.<eos> Now that we're all done being irradiated, I'm think I'm gonna go.<eos> I'm gonna go check out this famous coffee machine you keep talking about.<eos> Holden: Other way!
Hey! Listen, listen, listen.<eos> So I'm thinking to myself, and I say to myself, "self",<eos> "we ought to just do that, right?" So.<eos> Vee-o-walla!<eos> - (Giggles)
You can go, but you're not free.<eos> Copies of these photographs can be e-mailed to everyone on your contact list at any time.<eos> Understood?<eos> Something you should know.<eos> What?
You wanna party?<eos> No, I wanna see your boyfriend, Tommy.<eos> Well... he's not gonna give you your money back.<eos> I don't want my money back.<eos> Then what?
Yeah, I hear music sometimes.<eos> - How much for your gun?<eos> - What?<eos> I-I wanna buy your gun.<eos> How much?
I figure you paid $700 for it.<eos> I'll give you $1,500.<eos> $2,000.<eos> Okay, $2,000.<eos> With a free bump.
Fuck, man! Aah!<eos> So... That's the $2,000 I owe you.<eos> Less the $2,000 you stole from me, leaves what?<eos> How much I owe you now?<eos> Z-zero.
He bounced you on his knee, and you know what you did?<eos> You got a smile on your face this big.<eos> Ah, they're here.<eos> - You ready?<eos> - My backpack.
Because I'm fine.<eos> You just had a grand mal seizure.<eos> You're not fine.<eos> How are your eyes?<eos> Ow.
Don't tell Carrie.<eos> All right.<eos> So, he was working for the FBI?<eos> That's right.<eos> The whole time?
Unfortunately, that's not an option.<eos> Mossad can't be trusted to be even remotely objective on this, and the accusation is too serious to ignore.<eos> Well, what do you suggest?<eos> You recommend somebody absolutely trustworthy to represent US interests on the ground there.<eos> Like you, for example? No.
All he keeps saying is "Just get him to take the money, get him to take the money."<eos> So it wasn't to give to a man in Africa?<eos> You can fix this.<eos> You can tell the truth.<eos> The truth?
They didn't have a case.<eos> You got lucky then.<eos> Yeah, you did.<eos> - You're telling me, hey.<eos> - Real lucky. - Yeah.
You're probably wondering, "How the hell did he get out?"<eos> Well, the first thing I wanna say is, I did not do a deal with the FBI.<eos> I'm no informant.<eos> One of the first concepts I learned in Islam is that of brotherhood, that each Muslim woman is my sister, each man my brother, and that together, we are one large body who must protect each other.<eos> - Down.
On the whole, good, but better now.<eos> Are you okay, Mommy?<eos> Okay, Franny, can you play a little bit longer?<eos> Five more minutes?<eos> What a pretty child.
I'm a friend, not an advisor.<eos> Whatever you want to call it, you're doing her no favors.<eos> Isn't that for her to decide?<eos> How long has it been since you left the agency?<eos> - Three years?
You need to get over to Sekou's right away.<eos> Why? What's happened?<eos> There's a new video posted to his website.<eos> Hhold on.<eos> - What kind of video?
- No. I told you, the deal was to keep your mouth shut.<eos> I never agreed to that.<eos> I never signed anything.<eos> Well, then you're opening yourself up to re-arrest.<eos> For what?
What are you saying?<eos> I'm saying... Pressure was applied.<eos> I applied it.<eos> I made people do things that could put them in jail, that could put me in jail.<eos> What?
I need what you have on her... movements and contacts for the past two weeks.<eos> So, even if we had such information...<eos> You do.<eos> Why is the CIA asking the SVR about Israel?<eos> Not Israel.
So, even if we had such information...<eos> You do.<eos> Why is the CIA asking the SVR about Israel?<eos> Not Israel.<eos> One Israeli.
Head south on 95.<eos> I'll text you the address.<eos> I'm here to see the president-elect.<eos> - She's expecting me.<eos> - Just a second, sir.
Not so fast.<eos> Nothing's for nothing.<eos> Come on, Viktor. That isn't our arrangement.<eos> Like all arrangements, it's subject to review, surely.<eos> Not this one.
Standing here at the site of what is certainly the most destructive incident in New York City since 9/11.<eos> There are two confirmed dead and many more wounded, according to initial reports.<eos> Franny, you've seen enough of that, okay?<eos> Meanwhile, the city is bracing itself... It's gonna be on TV all day.<eos> Today and tomorrow and the next day and the next...
I need to see it again to get it right.<eos> Okay, pay attention.<eos> Nine potato-- nine potato, ten potato.<eos> Now you try.<eos> One more time.
What's she make of it? The bombing?<eos> I'd say she's still processing.<eos> You could tell, though, she's... not chastened, exactly, but a little more open.<eos> Open to you.<eos> To reality.
Franny, come on.<eos> I want to go.<eos> Your house guest. He's got an Glock 17.<eos> You know what that is?<eos> Yeah. What else?
You reached out to Dar Adal?<eos> I bet on a horse.<eos> In the end, I went with the sure thing.<eos> Are you going to be able to do this, live out here?<eos> Down!
What I mean is it's not just a question of how many inspectors or which sanctions.<eos> First and foremost, it's the face we present to the world.<eos> Secretary of State, for example.<eos> Anyone you were considering to help pivot towards Iran wouldn't be the one now to draw a line in the sand.<eos> Sanctions first.
You needed to be educated.<eos> So now I'm supposed to believe this.<eos> It was a gift from a doomed man.<eos> He wanted us to have the truth.<eos> The truth.
The "intelligence community."<eos> I mean, who even thinks like this?<eos> Ma'am, there's something else we should get out into the open, just so we're all clear.<eos> What, more good news?<eos> The bombing.
Max...<eos> Puh-trovski?<eos> This is quite a résumé, Max.<eos> Hardware, software, security clearance.<eos> Triple threat.
Madame President-Elect.<eos> Can I get you something to drink?<eos> It's still a little early for me.<eos> What I have is coffee or juice.<eos> Oh. Coffee.
Are you sure?<eos> I mean, if there is ever anything I can--<eos> I said I'm fine.<eos> It was really great seeing you again.<eos> Yeah. Uh, yeah, you too.
Hundreds of employees creating tens of thousands of fake users, each with personal histories, supporting details, multiple cyber presences.<eos> What do you call them again?<eos> Sock puppets.<eos> I've heard rumors of social media boiler rooms like this in Russia and in China, but not here.<eos> And definitely not on this scale.
Do me a favor, then-- Don't go there today.<eos> Why not?<eos> One, it's too dangerous.<eos> Look what happened to Conlin.<eos> And two?
What happened?<eos> Woke up this morning with a bit of a fever and a sore throat.<eos> What do you mean "a bit of a fever"?<eos> One hundred and two.<eos> A cough?
Come on in.<eos> We're all set to go.<eos> H-Hey, Rob... was it you guys who sent the car for me this morning?<eos> No, not us.<eos> Why?
It's been almost two years.<eos> I meant for good.<eos> I'm in trouble.<eos> I have to disappear.<eos> What kind of trouble?
The video.<eos> Well, where do you think I got it?<eos> We just shot it-- me and Peter did.<eos> When?<eos> Just now, like, an hour ago.
We got reinforcements on the way.<eos> What do you mean "reinforcements"?<eos> Carrie, I got to call you back.<eos> Wait!<eos> What reinforcements?
Where are you going?<eos> Come back here!<eos> Actually, don't consider this an interrogation at all.<eos> It's a reprimand.<eos> For what?
A team of Deltas is providing an additional layer of security.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Are those the reinforcements you were talking about?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why?
We have to consider the possibility there's another bomb out there.<eos> What do you suggest we do...<eos> Move her out of Manhattan?<eos> 'Cause she'd never go for that.<eos> Not again.
- You too, Carrie.<eos> - Something coming?<eos> - What?<eos> A lot of firepower.<eos> Behind the barricade.
Say again, sir.<eos> Engage?<eos> He tried to kill the President-elect.<eos> Take him out.<eos> In position!
- as far as I can tell. - Well, in point of fact, we have two memoranda from the Justice Department right here.<eos> And how was Saul Berenson connected?<eos> He almost died in the bombing.<eos> There's evidence of his complicity.<eos> - Where? What evidence?
Previously on Homeland...<eos> Hi, I'm from the Administration for Children's Services.<eos> After my talk with Franny, I made a determination that she's at imminent risk for further harm.<eos> What?
- He ran past you? - Mm-hmm.<eos> You mean he was running away?<eos> He was killed by a sniper, right?<eos> Where-- where-- where was he shot?<eos> In the back.
Sort of.<eos> That's fine.<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> My dreams have a realness.<eos> Uh, my realness.
Peter. Give me a hand here, will you?<eos> What is it?<eos> Nothing.<eos> - Whose house is this?<eos> Hey! What?
Give me your best shot.<eos> Oh, Christ's sake, Peter, what do you think you're doing?<eos> - Trying to convince you to give me another chance.<eos> - Well, you won't. - No?<eos> - No, not like this, no.
What's he doing here?<eos> He has something important to talk to you about. What?<eos> I think you should hear it from him.<eos> Did you see that in there?<eos> Just the end.
Because if the Agency is financing a domestic propaganda campaign, they're way outside the law.<eos> Could be just the leverage we've been looking for, put them down for real.<eos> Maybe something good can come of this.<eos> - Madam President-Elect.<eos> - Just a minute.
Did I say "yes"?<eos> Fine.<eos> Do yourself a favor, though, and change out of that bloody shirt before they get here.<eos> He killed Astrid.<eos> What?
Do yourself a favor, though, and change out of that bloody shirt before they get here.<eos> He killed Astrid.<eos> What?<eos> She came all the way from Berlin to take care of me, and...<eos> And what?
You want to tell me?<eos> What do these letters look like to you?<eos> A "B"?<eos> "R"? "P," maybe?<eos> Which?
The bullet. Another bullet.<eos> You know, honestly, when I got the call, I thought it was some kind of sick joke.<eos> You and your daughter seem to have the same sense of humor.<eos> I need a priest.<eos> - A priest?
There's gonna be somebody I can talk to to...<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> I'll find someone.<eos> She didn't deserve this, okay?<eos> - Any of it.
If you'll excuse me.<eos> How's he doing?<eos> If glass is made from sand, how come you can see through it?<eos> How much morphine did you give him?<eos> - All of it.
Yeah. Oh, good.<eos> You know, hey.<eos> You get to stand around with the rest of us worried schmucks, right?<eos> You know, human component aside, would've been helpful if a few more people got shot.<eos> What?
What-what happened to my ass?<eos> Um, the force of the impact caused a fascial tear, and your gluteal implant herniated.<eos> Your, uh, your-your fake butt flipped.<eos> So, just... unflip it.<eos> What?
Other pocket.<eos> Charlie Harris' phone.<eos> You won a cruise.<eos> Hang up.<eos> What?
Yeah, what makes you say that?<eos> Because I've seen the way that she looks at you and...<eos> I know that look.<eos> Dawn?<eos> What?
When everything settles, you come back in, we'll repair the implant.<eos> Yeah, but how long until I get my butt back?<eos> It could be several weeks.<eos> - No dancing, obviously.<eos> - Dude.
- I...<eos> - You know, apparently, some of them actually serve food.<eos> I mean, $10.99 for a steak sandwich and a face dance?<eos> There is not enough hand sanitizer in the world.<eos> Uh...
Give us more time to find the tear.<eos> And then suture it closed.<eos> But once I cut off the blood supply, she's got maybe five minutes before her other organs shut down.<eos> - Five minutes?<eos> - Clamp.
I'm sure that's not true.<eos> She found me a couple years ago.<eos> You know, one of those agencies, and, uh...<eos> Right after we reconnected, she was shot.<eos> For the first time.
I know.<eos> I know.<eos> I'll get you some crutches before you head out.<eos> Dustin, have you been using cocaine?<eos> What?
- Well, looks like you owe your resident a steak dinner.<eos> Oh, I'm a vegetarian.<eos> Oh. Then an expensive chickpea salad.<eos> Look, the fracture runs along the anterior skull base<eos> - through his cribriform plate.
- through his cribriform plate.<eos> - And if I'd sent him home?<eos> He probably wouldn't have made it to work Monday morning.<eos> Well, he doesn't work mornings.<eos> What?
More, more.<eos> I, uh, probably don't want to see this.<eos> Yeah, me neither.<eos> There.<eos> Nice tux.
So, you decided to double down.<eos> Put a ring on it.<eos> Yeah, apparently I do that.<eos> Well, can I see it?<eos> What?
The ring.<eos> Well, actually, she's got the hardware.<eos> I just... I just have the fancy box.<eos> Oh, Dr. Kinney, I wanted you to know that Dustin's surgery went off without a hitch.<eos> And you what?
You wanna gloat?<eos> It's not really my style.<eos> I prefer a quiet, self-congratulatory smugness.<eos> I wanted to apologize.<eos> For what?
No.<eos> Charlie?<eos> The light's too bright.<eos> - Charlie, what's going on?<eos> - Oh, no.
I fell in love with a pagan queen, who saw my sister in a vision.<eos> Uhtred, she lives, and is being held in the North.<eos> In the year 878 at Ethandune, I fought alongside King Alfred to defeat the Danes, and drove them from Wessex, but at a great price.<eos> Uhtred Ragnarson, I have a gift for you.<eos> Your queen!
The brothers, Sigefrid and Erik.<eos> They've gone to fight the Scots.<eos> I beg you, Lord, he will be my income.<eos> Halig, give this piece of weasel shit a coin.<eos> A coin, Lord?
I must inform Abbot Eadred.<eos> Lord Abbot... he is here.<eos> They believe you to be the king, Lord.<eos> Then let him be the king.<eos> King for the day.
King Guthred is building up an army... made up of both Danes and Saxons.<eos> And the commander of this army is just that... both Dane and Saxon.<eos> His name is Uhtred.<eos> - Are you certain of this? - Yes.<eos> Tekil...
It's open. Come in.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I'm fine. Just a nosebleed.<eos> I take it you're here to yell at me about the book?<eos> What book?
- Ready?<eos> - Yep.<eos> All right.<eos> One King James Bible wrapped in Saran Wrap.<eos> One thermos.
Mark felt left out and ran off to Mexico for three years.<eos> You know what he's doing now?<eos> No. Why?<eos> I think he's running a carrot stick out of St. Louis.<eos> No shit?
F-four series regulars.<eos> Three go, one stays.<eos> Me.<eos> You know what the odds of that are?<eos> One in 128,000.
Hey, look.<eos> I got a tattoo.<eos> A couple hundred more and I'll catch up with you.<eos> Let's have a baby.<eos> What?
Shit!<eos> Help.<eos> Hey there.<eos> No.<eos> Fucker!
- Yeah?<eos> Go fuck yourself.<eos> - Hey there!<eos> You're building a boat.<eos> For the flood.
Bleached in the sun.<eos> The phones were down.<eos> They had no way of knowing if I was ever coming home or if I had simply vanished like their father had.<eos> So, they set out on foot...<eos> Across the flats...
Are you finally gonna read it?<eos> - I already did.<eos> - Really?<eos> When? On the plane when you were asleep.<eos> - The whole thing?
- I already did.<eos> - Really?<eos> When? On the plane when you were asleep.<eos> - The whole thing?<eos> - The whole thing.
And when He went into the woods, he lifted the girl to His shoulder<eos> "and she slept, she pressed to Him and He to her."<eos> He capitalizes your Hs.<eos> "Now the sun rose and they had come to a well, and He placed the girl down upon its edge and..."<eos> What?
She's a departure.<eos> Abort. Abort.<eos> Sir, did your sister disappear on October 14th?<eos> Yes.<eos> Why?
Then why are you still using that accent?<eos> - I have to go.<eos> - No, no.<eos> What the fuck is going on?<eos> What?
So, how does this work? You give me a name, I go to a hotel room, explain what Low Amplitude Denziger Radiation is, and then what? Do I come back here or what?<eos> That won't be necessary.<eos> What?<eos> Why? I'm afraid we will not be proceeding any further.<eos> What?
I need to get to Melbourne immediately.<eos> I'm asking you to fly me there.<eos> But the explosion...<eos> They said all flights have been grounded.<eos> All nonessential flights.
So, I refuse, Matt, to believe that he's the goddamn second coming of Christ!<eos> _<eos> _<eos> What are those?<eos> For my allergies.
You want some?<eos> I'm not hungry.<eos> There's still time.<eos> Even if we can't get a flight, we can take this ferry back and Arturo can fly us home.<eos> What?
Thank you all for coming.<eos> I'm glad you're here.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Actually, Laurie... I'm dying.<eos> What?
I should be getting dinner ready.<eos> I'll be back before it's on the table.<eos> Storm's coming.<eos> What you drinking?<eos> Just some coffee.
Do you have to tell them I did this?<eos> Give me a dollar.<eos> I only have hundreds.<eos> Give me, um... give me your cigarettes.<eos> Congratulations, Nora Durst.
I think so.<eos> Where's everybody?<eos> Inside, sleeping.<eos> I drugged their food.<eos> Jesus, Laurie.
Inside, sleeping.<eos> I drugged their food.<eos> Jesus, Laurie.<eos> Well, I wanted to talk to you.<eos> Just the two of us.
I threw it in a sewer grate and then went back for it.<eos> Don't tell Jill that.<eos> That's nothing.<eos> I killed her hamster.<eos> - You what? - Yeah.
- It was our house.<eos> - You loved it.<eos> I wanted you to be happy.<eos> I was pregnant.<eos> What?
What are you doing right now?<eos> Where are you?<eos> I'm just hanging out.<eos> By yourself?<eos> On the anniversary?
Are you fucking serious?<eos> My father was murdered... my mother, my brother... all of them gone in an instant because of a drone strike ordered by your administration.<eos> No. N-no, that's not what happened.<eos> You were killed.<eos> What?
Now your penis, please, sir.<eos> - My what?<eos> - Your penis.<eos> Place it on the other scanner, please, sir.<eos> Why?
It's an ethical deterrent.<eos> The nuclear launch key was surgically embedded into the heart of a volunteer.<eos> In order for the president to be able to blow up millions of people with the push of a button, he has to extract that key by murdering the volunteer himself.<eos> But since I don't see that volunteer here, you can't launch shit.<eos> What?
That's from Machiavelli.<eos> Put your faith in me, Mr. Harvey.<eos> Identity confirmed.<eos> Stop right there! Stop!<eos> Down! Down on the stairs.
Why... Why is he doing this?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Did he say anything else?<eos> - He asked me to a dance.<eos> - A dance?
You're a fucking liar!<eos> I saw you dancing with that man. That man you said you didn't know.<eos> I'll pray for the safe return of your birds.<eos> Don't waste your breath.<eos> God.
It's not true.<eos> That's how I found you, Nora. I...<eos> I refused to believe you were gone.<eos> You want some tea?<eos> What?
Max fucked us.<eos> If it wasn't for her, we likely take Nassau whole, fleet intact, no prisoners in the fort, no fight between you and I.<eos> Instead, here we are.<eos> Now, one would think we could go a long way towards soothing all that chaos out there, and the anger driving it... if we could draw everyone together to see justice done to the one responsible for all of it.<eos> - All of it?

And he and I have discussed it at length.<eos> So, I thank you for your concern. But I'm going to be just fine.<eos> And I'm not talking about you.<eos> I understand that you've come to care for her.<eos> Madi.
Be very... very careful, Billy.<eos> If anyone is at risk of being consumed by his need for this war... it's her.<eos> Time's up.<eos> I heard you were there.<eos> What?
She told him that this was no place for a little girl.<eos> That it was cruel.<eos> I stay, and our child is raised amongst all this brutality.<eos> I go, and my husband... is left alone to face it on his own.<eos> Amazing, this place.
That the decisions you made at every turn would eventually lead us to this.<eos> Everything I have is gone... because of it.<eos> If you wish to apologize, what happened today... does not begin to cover it.<eos> Where would we have gone?<eos> What?
There may be ways of severing oneself in that way... sacrificing one part to save the other.<eos> But... in that moment... I honestly couldn't find something sharp enough to make the cut.<eos> What would have been enough?<eos> I truly am sorry.<eos> For all of it.
I think we've all seen our fair share of loss and I have had enough of it.<eos> So, I'd like to ensure that this fight does not come to pass.<eos> How do you suggest we do that?<eos> I am prepared to surrender the governor's remaining forces to you... control of the fort, its guns, its magazine, the unconditional release of the remainder of your prisoners.<eos> All of it.
I am prepared to surrender the governor's remaining forces to you... control of the fort, its guns, its magazine, the unconditional release of the remainder of your prisoners.<eos> All of it.<eos> - You're prepared to do all of that?<eos> - Yes.<eos> In exchange for what?
Without the resources afforded by the cache or the force supplied by Billy and his men, how the fuck do you imagine we're going to do that?<eos> We will struggle through it, train men, gain strength through numbers, hunt for that which we need.<eos> It will be difficult.<eos> But since when did we expect this would be anything else?<eos> What?
Look, I got a deal about to go down with some Dominicans. Right?<eos> They're gonna move my product on the north side.<eos> That'll put me back on top.<eos> I'll be a'ight.<eos> Yeah. What?
I'll be in the library with your uncle, okay?<eos> Senator.<eos> I got to meet with the FCC. They didn't know what hit 'em.<eos> Thanks so much for coming. Thanks for your help.<eos> Absolutely. Sure.
During her sophomore year.<eos> Show me.<eos> This doesn't make sense.<eos> She was young.<eos> Yeah. Still...
If I've been taking it out on you, I'm sorry.<eos> Whatever.<eos> Come on. Don't be like that, all right?<eos> Take us a half hour, at least, to get cross town to Royo, bro.<eos> I... What?
But you're staying right there.<eos> Ben, I got your money.<eos> Just give me the list and we're done.<eos> I've got eyes on Grimes.<eos> - Any sign of the list?
We're locking down the area, but it doesn't look good.<eos> What about Carter?<eos> Is he all right?<eos> Carter's fine, but he identified one of the terrorists as Jadalla Bin-Khalid.<eos> Jadalla?
Is he alone?<eos> They put him in a room, but there's a doctor examining him.<eos> Was he on an I.V.? Yes.<eos> Okay, you need to get your hands on a syringe.<eos> As large as possible.
- Good.<eos> Don't want you to drop out like your brother.<eos> Why didn't you tell us you were coming?<eos> I just wanted to surprise you.<eos> Why?
- Nobody! - Nah, you lying.<eos> Who you been talking to?<eos> - Nobody, Isaac! You're no better than the rest of 'em.<eos> What y'all looking at? Nothing, man.<eos> We cool.
You have signed those Rangers' death warrants, you understand?<eos> You have a chance here to make this right, to save people from dying, and you're pulling this?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Tell her the truth!<eos> - Son of a bitch!
Please?<eos> Untie me.<eos> Khasan would never allow it.<eos> Just call the police.<eos> The police? Yes.
Do you have visual confirmation on any of the targets?<eos> Negative.<eos> Most of the windows are boarded up.<eos> We're going in blind.<eos> On my signal.
We're not murderers.<eos> What you're doing is not the way to change things.<eos> Khasan is wrong.<eos> Khasan is dead.<eos> What? What?
He and I will be together again soon.<eos> [sniffles] And someone will find you.<eos> I'm sorry, Papa.<eos> Who is this?<eos> Amira?
Courage?<eos> Something you could've used a little bit more of.<eos> Look, I'm gonna send CTU to pick you up.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - For what?
You got three seconds.<eos> What the hell are you doing here?<eos> You left CTU with your laptop and your development kit in the middle of a terrorist event.<eos> That's not normal behavior.<eos> Even for you.
What is this?<eos> What do you want?<eos> Just the truth, Mr. Donovan.<eos> That's why we're here.<eos> The truth about what?
He knows his father's missing. And you had something to do with it.<eos> And he's threatening to call the A.G.<eos> Okay, I'll talk to him.<eos> What are you gonna tell him?<eos> The truth.
We got to move.<eos> Come on.<eos> Nicole, you all right?<eos> We need to call CTU.<eos> Hell no.
Hear you out? So that you can try to convince me<eos> - to let you torture him?<eos> No, Rebecca.<eos> - If he knows how to get in contact with Jadalla Bin-Khalid, we need to find out.<eos> Not like this.
Carter found them.<eos> We got the bleeding under control.<eos> All right, thanks.<eos> I just want to say thank you, man.<eos> For everything.
What's that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> The same thing that made me... run the streets. The same thing that made me pick up a gun when I was 12, with my brother and his crew.<eos> I'm still holding a gun, I'm just pointing it at different people.<eos> The right people.
Hang on.<eos> Grab the wheel.<eos> This left up ahead?<eos> Step out of the vehicle with your hands raised.<eos> On your knees.
Sure.<eos> What's Pang doing here?<eos> Well, I report to him now.<eos> He's here on Director Simms' orders.<eos> One, uh, setback too many.
Senator. Can we talk?<eos> I think we've said everything that we need to say to each other.<eos> We can save Rebecca.<eos> Excuse us, please.<eos> What?
One of them is still active.<eos> Okay, Andy, is there any way to trace it and find a location for Naseri?<eos> No, the GPS is encrypted.<eos> Hold on.<eos> What?
Andy, I need eyes on, man.<eos> I'm running out of road. Okay, SAT one's almost in position.<eos> It took a little bit longer than usual because I had to mask the bandwidth by spreading it through different sockets.<eos> - Okay... it's up.<eos> Uh, one second...
I'll mirror it real time to your phone.<eos> Hello?<eos> Don't move.<eos> Hands.<eos> On the floor. Now.
Bin-Khalid is standing beside her.<eos> He's speaking Arabic.<eos> What's he saying?<eos> He's saying he wants to bring justice to the war criminal, Rebecca Ingram,<eos> "murderer of my beloved son".
Ara will be very happy to know that, thank you.<eos> Carter. I can see you.<eos> Continue onto the train tracks, stop next to the brick building on your right.<eos> Wait in your car.<eos> - For what?
- He's on his way, Rebecca.<eos> - Oh, my back hurts.<eos> - You're okay. Got a clean entry wound above her pelvis.<eos> Let's prep her for surgery.<eos> Ready on three.
What my sister means is her teeth are perfect for slicing bread.<eos> Well, how wonderful!<eos> How lucky am I to have such unusual children in my life?<eos> Are you Count Olaf's wife?<eos> What?
All right, then.<eos> Well, I hope I can prove myself to be the father you never had.<eos> We had a father.<eos> Yes, I know.<eos> And a mother.
And a mother.<eos> Remarkable woman.<eos> Flammable.<eos> So, Poe, do I need to sign for them or something?<eos> What?
There's only one bed.<eos> As you can see, I have provided, at no cost to you, this complimentary pile of rocks.<eos> Thoughts?<eos> Thoughts?<eos> First of all--
It is the first burst of applause when the curtain rises.<eos> The second burst of applause when the leading man glides out from the wings, faces his crowd and recites the--<eos> Soliloquy.<eos> I'm... That's...<eos> His soliloquy.
But sometimes, and every actor does this, I ask myself, "Is it worth it?<eos> Is it really worth it to chase an enormous fortune?"<eos> Boss...<eos> - Where's the roast beef?<eos> - What?
Closed casket.<eos> Why don't we just roast him?<eos> Oh, that's lovely.<eos> And no, he's going to be buried next to your grandmother. I think that gramps would like to have a viking funeral.<eos> Viking?
I've been thinking.<eos> What?<eos> How about a weekend away?<eos> It can be a work thing. Right?<eos> Like a conference or a workshop.
Um, bullet catcher iv.<eos> I uh, I saw your uncle today- dad, uh, do you mind?<eos> I'm online here with a couple players.<eos> Sure.<eos> What?
Takes after his dad.<eos> May I ask what you do for a living?<eos> I'm in it.<eos> Um, computers.<eos> Jesus Christ, my laptop!
Do you mind?<eos> Of course.<eos> What happened?<eos> Baseball.<eos> Kids.
Growing boys eat like their limbs are empty, hmm?<eos> What's the American term for it?<eos> Chow down?<eos> Yeah. It's a... military expression.<eos> Hmm. For eating.
He is not famous for his toasts. -Yeah, no kidding.<eos> Watch out.<eos> To everyone's health.<eos> Including financially.<eos> And lastly, to my father.
And he loved that boat.<eos> Imir, we're passing on a piece of wiston family history to you, and I know we've only just met but I think my dad would approve.<eos> Because you're a good man.<eos> Thank you. I am honoured.<eos> Cheers. Cheers.
So, the military, they just allow that?<eos> Talk to me.<eos> Alright, I checked the logs.<eos> We flew a sortie into miranshah.<eos> Oneyearagotoday.
Ok,thenwho?<eos> Just answer the question, will ya?<eos> I don't know, maybe, but it's a stretch.<eos> What- what's this about?<eos> Nothing.
Do they ever show you pictures of the innocents you kill, Neil?<eos> I've got your things.<eos> Are you a dutiful wife, Ellen?<eos> Sorry?<eos> What?
Forget about it?<eos> Ok. Ok.<eos> Uh... how- how long we been partners, now?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Three years?
May I speak, please?<eos> ! Jesus, what is it? !<eos> Beg your pardon, but you'd asked to be notified when we were finished dressing the body.<eos> Thank you, Mr. Rawls.<eos> What?
- Jack.<eos> - I heard you.<eos> Go see what kind of surgeon you can engage for Anne.<eos> I'll... do this.<eos> What?
I heard he cut off a man's head and left it as a marker in the sand to anyone who would cross him.<eos> It was a little more complicated than that.<eos> - I heard... - Hmm? ...he sometimes butchered his enemies for amusement, made stew of their flesh.<eos> He was truly an animal.<eos> - Stew?
And you possess it now?<eos> No.<eos> You do.<eos> You brought a friend.<eos> A partner.
Good morning.<eos> I had no idea that being "just friends" was gonna be so uncomfortable.<eos> Hey, I offered to take the floor, but you insisted that Lil Wayne was a gentleman.<eos> Truer words have never been spoken.<eos> What?
Someone posted it on Chat Bandit.<eos> Seriously?<eos> Why?<eos> To tell me what a racist ass I am,<eos> - apparently. - What?
Mine's blowing up, too.<eos> This is the photo I posted on Instagram.<eos> I dressed up as Lil Wayne. You'd think I went as a KKK member.<eos> "Just another brainless white girl, coasting on her white privilege."<eos> What?
Is she part of your sorority?<eos> Black student union.<eos> Oh. I didn't know you hung out with them.<eos> Well, a lot's happened in the last 10 months.<eos> Like what?
Excuse me, you go here?<eos> Sign our petition? - _<eos> - Greg Shimingo is an RA in Hanes Dorm.<eos> Apparently, he's got a long history of bigotry.<eos> What?
- Hey, Regina?<eos> - Yes?<eos> Hook me up with a latte?<eos> What the hell?<eos> - Oh, no!
Red! Sorry, guys.<eos> Hey.<eos> What happened?<eos> The RA board voted to keep me.<eos> What? Ugh.
We are thrilled.<eos> You made the right decision, son.<eos> Turns out it was my only decision.<eos> The NCAA found out the other school was offering me a car, and well, they rescinded their offer this afternoon.<eos> Oh, no.
For you this is all just some fun academic debate, but I'm talking about my emotional safety.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Everywhere I go on campus, I have to be on guard.<eos> I have to put on this... like, this armor to protect me from stuff you don't see.<eos> Like what?
I don't know, since yesterday?<eos> Why didn't you say anything?<eos> It was probably that breakfast that I had with Travis.<eos> I kinda knew that a lukewarm shrimp burrito was a bad idea.<eos> What?
It was probably that breakfast that I had with Travis.<eos> I kinda knew that a lukewarm shrimp burrito was a bad idea.<eos> What?<eos> Doorbell.<eos> What the hey!
We have to reschedule. - Oh.<eos> - No, wait a second.<eos> Luca's already here.<eos> Why doesn't he stay?<eos> For the wedding?
So long, Shimingo.<eos> - John?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Luca's already with someone.<eos> What?
Mostly she was telling me what happened in China.<eos> Sounds like she saw some pretty rough stuff over there.<eos> You mean at the clinic?<eos> I mean having her sister almost die in front of her.<eos> What?
I already heard all of that.<eos> She took pity on you because you needed a friend.<eos> Yeah, I did.<eos> But so did she.<eos> - Because of Travis?
- Here you go.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> You bet.<eos> Well...<eos> L'chaim.
Practice.<eos> All warfare is the same.<eos> Two questions are of paramount importance... who was my opponent yesterday, and who is he today?<eos> Answer those two questions, and there is very little he can... hide from you.<eos> What?
He dragged it here.<eos> Should we fetch Mr. Hands?<eos> We should head back.<eos> You sailed with Avery.<eos> Long time ago.
You know of me all I can bear to be known.<eos> All that is relevant to be known.<eos> That is to say, you know my genuine friendship... and loyalty.<eos> Can that be enough and there still be trust between us?<eos> Again.
I'm almost certain I can figure it out.<eos> All is well?<eos> I thought I heard it.<eos> Thought you heard what?<eos> A woman.
Tell us about Rita.<eos> He wants to know about Rita.<eos> That oughta do it.<eos> What are you hoping to accomplish here, Will?<eos> Blackmail?
You went to a great deal of trouble, Mr. Gorski, to bring us to this point.<eos> Where do we go from here?<eos> Since he can't hear me, we're gonna have to play a fun little game of telephone.<eos> Repeat every word I say.<eos> First...
- Lito.<eos> Listen, he starts out kind of like a bad guy, but I think I can give him a bit of vulnerability<eos> - so he doesn't look too much of a jerk.<eos> - The studio pulled the offer.<eos> What?
We should get rid of the bus.<eos> Find a parking lot.<eos> Agreed.<eos> What are we doing?<eos> Shopping.
Agreed.<eos> What are we doing?<eos> Shopping.<eos> Wi-Fi alarm.<eos> Too risky.
Yeah! Come on!<eos> He's free in the middle!<eos> Lewandowski's free!<eos> Come on!<eos> Yeah!
Hey, Wolfie, any idea what this guy's talking about?<eos> Yeah. International money laundering.<eos> Big scale.<eos> Oh, you're good.<eos> How big?
Pretty big.<eos> He's afraid that a gang war would be bad for business.<eos> Help me and I promise to make it worth your while.<eos> We might be interested.<eos> - Cheers.
- It's coming. In the room.<eos> Cars.<eos> - There's cars in the room.<eos> Cars. - Ah!<eos> - Parking? - No.
No, no.<eos> All our inside spots are already taken, but there's adequate street parking.<eos> "Adequate." An appropriate word.<eos> It... it looked bigger in the pictures.<eos> Yes, a tiny bit.
- Yes?<eos> - Yeah, I love it.<eos> - It's ours.<eos> - It's twice.<eos> - Twice? - Yes.
- It's ours.<eos> - It's twice.<eos> - Twice? - Yes.<eos> Twice.<eos> Twice.
Who?<eos> My father.<eos> What a mad, wonderful man he was.<eos> He passed?<eos> Cancer.
I'm one of those silly people who believe that if you kill someone, you should be tried for it, whether you're a psychopath, a policeman or a president.<eos> You're worse than a liberal.<eos> Oh, Daya, may I have some of the Dal?<eos> Dad, the Dal... phenomenal.<eos> One second, one second.
- It sounds so fun.<eos> Come on, Lito. You have to go.<eos> Maybe this is just what you need.<eos> To remember how many people are affected by what you did.<eos> Yeah, great idea.
Really?<eos> - Tell him yourself.<eos> - What?<eos> He's sitting right there.<eos> Holy shit.
- How afraid they are of people like you.<eos> Right now, all we can offer you is a little... invisibility.<eos> E-Death.<eos> If you accept this offer, there may come a day when we ask something of you.<eos> What?
He's going after the other kings.<eos> That's his choice.<eos> Maybe it will work out for Sebastian, maybe it won't. What I'm going to make sure is that it works out for me.<eos> Hm. - And maybe...<eos> - Me.
A friend.<eos> I figured.<eos> Ms. Bak, I think, could use a friend.<eos> Look, what she's trying to do, as good as she is... she cannot do alone.<eos> Thanks for the tea.
Guys, are we really going to put our lives in the hands of someone like Vincent?<eos> What do you mean someone like Vincent?<eos> - Someone who...<eos> - Doesn't like his movies.<eos> Nah.
Not just the plan.<eos> What do you think about the risk itself?<eos> Your life is either defined by the system... or by the way you defy the system.<eos> Fear never fixed anything.<eos> To courage.
- God, I miss...<eos> - this.<eos> Me, too.<eos> Life on beta blockers... is no life at all.<eos> What?
Are you mad at me?<eos> No.<eos> Or me?<eos> I've been mad at many things these days.<eos> Mostly myself.
When I'm with you... all the rules... and the logic of everyday life... things that were so important to me... all go away.<eos> And all I feel... is how fast my heart beats... whenever I'm with you.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Not too bad for a machine, huh?<eos> What?
Whole underground world of abandoned places people use like their hotel rooms.<eos> It's more like camping.<eos> The same rules, you try to leave it better than how you found it.<eos> If I had a good show, I'd always try and leave a little gift somewhere.<eos> - Like what?
I'm trying to make a life.<eos> Pretending isn't a life.<eos> - Wolfie! - Yeah!<eos> Coming!<eos> So... big day tomorrow.
Welcome to the Highlands of Scotland, Miss Blue.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> Reminds me of home.<eos> Dinner's ready.<eos> Aye, just a moment.
I'm one of those silly people who believe that if you kill someone, you should be tried for it, whether you're a psychopath, a policeman or a president.<eos> You're worse than a liberal.<eos> Oh, Daya, may I have some of the Dal?<eos> Dad, the Dal... phenomenal.<eos> One second, one second.

You continue to impress, Officer Gorski.<eos> Wait, if Whispers wanted you lobotomized, then who stopped the surgery?<eos> The only person in BPO with more power than him.<eos> - Are you talking about...<eos> - The Chairman.
Hernando... how many gay action stars are there?<eos> No, let me rephrase.<eos> How many out gay action stars are now, or will be employed this year or the foreseeable future? I'll tell you. I'll tell you.<eos> It's a nice round number.<eos> Zero.
No, let me rephrase.<eos> How many out gay action stars are now, or will be employed this year or the foreseeable future? I'll tell you. I'll tell you.<eos> It's a nice round number.<eos> Zero.<eos> Zero.
Is that him?<eos> Hey, Officer Strange, you coming?<eos> Come on.<eos> You want to hit me, don't you?<eos> Huh?
No, nothing.<eos> She doesn't, does she?<eos> - Shit.<eos> - Shit.<eos> What?
She wanted this fight.<eos> But if he knew it was a trap, why wouldn't he ask us for help?<eos> Ask for help?<eos> Can't picture it.<eos> Greco di Tufo.
You good?<eos> We're good.<eos> Teagan Marks, do you take this man to be your husband?<eos> It's pretty good.<eos> "Pretty good"?
I know. Lito loves Iberian Dreams, but the Ladies offer is real.<eos> It's killing me. It's heartbreaking, but it's timing, and this business, it's all about timing.<eos> All right, yeah. I'll wait... if you think you can do something.<eos> Talk to me, Jean-Baptiste.<eos> What?
Carol Cumberland took a bunch of pills and slit her wrists.<eos> Why?<eos> Why was Jonas there?<eos> Are you asking me or someone else in your head?<eos> You.
Oh, shit.<eos> This is Joong-Ki Bak.<eos> Open the fucking gate right now!<eos> Love to, J-Bak. But first, I need you to do something for me.<eos> What?
- Oh, my God, I don't believe this.<eos> Amanita Caplan... will you marry me?<eos> Abso-fucking-lutely!<eos> You?<eos> Every day of my life.
You?<eos> Every day of my life.<eos> Smells so good.<eos> You cannot change the world on an empty stomach.<eos> Whoa!
You want one?<eos> Yes.<eos> That's a very good idea.<eos> I have been thinking about a lot of things that have been going on with me.<eos> - And with us.
I have to go.<eos> If you guys want to kill me, then just do it quick.<eos> What just happened?<eos> - I've been quarantined.<eos> The Cannibal.
Because right now I need something.<eos> I need to know something... before I get any more confused.<eos> And every time I kiss you, I'm always left even more confused than I ever was.<eos> But before I get on a plane and go anywhere... before I discover what it actually feels like... to be in the same room with you... before I know what it really feels like... to have these lips against mine and... not just in my head... something I might be imagining... I need to know something.<eos> What?
Good!<eos> Because I want it to be just for us.<eos> Welcome home, sexy.<eos> I've missed you.<eos> What?
Paddles.<eos> Now.<eos> Again.<eos> Yes.<eos> Once more.
Hold on.<eos> Security protocol has been activated.<eos> It's not reading.<eos> I'm going to have to call this in.<eos> On your knees!
It's only bearable because the alternative is not.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> You've been hiding?<eos> It's difficult for me in Berlin right now.<eos> Because of Lila?
And I know you feel the same.<eos> I do.<eos> But I can't be with you in my city.<eos> I'll come to Berlin.<eos> Too dangerous.
Will, help me.<eos> Will, please.<eos> Help me.<eos> - It's about Sara, Dad.<eos> - Oh, no.
End of the line! End of the line!<eos> Don't forget, rally this weekend!<eos> It's gonna be off the chain!<eos> Rally.<eos> This weekend.
Um, darling?<eos> Can I borrow that?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Nice.<eos> Not quite.
You'll connect the dots, synthesize the information in a way few others in this world can.<eos> You always do.<eos> It'll be an amazing thing to see.<eos> But I won't be there to see it.<eos> What, then?
I forgot to say please, didn't I?<eos> I'm working on that.<eos> Please?<eos> Always a lovely word to hear, but I'm not some deputy anymore.<eos> No.
Always a lovely word to hear, but I'm not some deputy anymore.<eos> No.<eos> I get that and respect it.<eos> But we both know why you're not a deputy anymore, so I am asking you to do this one for me.<eos> As a final courtesy.
Mr. Rhoades.<eos> So, I'm going through my initial round of interviews and all seems, if not kosher, then at least within a reasonable bandwidth.<eos> And I'm thinking, you know, I'm just about out of here.<eos> But... Then I become aware of a payment.<eos> A payment?
We have to give each other room.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> I'm aware.<eos> Not a social call.<eos> What, then?
What, then?<eos> I understand that we are in a temporary moment of separation and no longer in the mode of telling each other our day's events in detail.<eos> If we'd been communicating that well before, we might still be together.<eos> Are we putting that on me?<eos> Half of it at least.
I'm not allowed to ink clients at the shop yet.<eos> I'm just an apprentice.<eos> Yeah, uh, but apparently that doesn't mean much here.<eos> My boss is a little territorial and even if I did get her on board, I still need someone to work on.<eos> You?
G.I. Joe, did you get my text?<eos> I need to talk to you about something.<eos> Do I need to stage an intervention?<eos> You look exhausted.<eos> What...
All right.<eos> Let's see some here, Chris.<eos> Come on, nice and easy.<eos> Nice job painting the corners there, buddy.<eos> One more now.
The police caught who did it.<eos> Two guys from Dillon Hall.<eos> That's a relief.<eos> You want to know what happened to them?<eos> What?
And results.<eos> So, do you think she's doing the right thing?<eos> I'm worried about her health of course, but if she's that committed to the cause, then... maybe you need to respect her willingness to take such a risk.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> What?
Oh. That makes sense.<eos> So, Gavin, um, you've built quite the self-storage empire.<eos> What's your secret?<eos> Our top two demos: the big ho's. What?<eos> Homeless and hoarders.
Do they not realize what we've done for them already?<eos> I pointed that out, sir, but... the daughter's medicated and very fragile at the moment.<eos> All right.<eos> Mrs. Miller.<eos> -I'm so very sorry.
I will tell you, our intelligence community, they are the real heroes.<eos> Charlie, if we could get back to my point, my sources confirmed--<eos> Heather Dunbar, no friend of mine or my husband's, looked into these charges, and cleared the president.<eos> Cleared?<eos> Please.
He's not a monster like they all say.<eos> - I lost him somewhere. - But he's not...<eos> But still, monsters do exist, don't they?<eos> I want my lawyer.<eos> What for?
- Move!<eos> - Car!<eos> It was just paint.<eos> She's all right.<eos> And what else?
-Should I be afraid?<eos> -Don't be smart.<eos> I should, shouldn't I?<eos> I stole something from you.<eos> What?
Pappy Van Winkle.<eos> A lovely gesture... but I'm afraid my trainer has made me promise to abstain.<eos> You see, if I let myself get fat, then the girls will only want me for my money.<eos> Well, I'll leave you to your game then, huh?<eos> For the whiskey.
Tell you what.<eos> If you Agatha Christie yourself to the bottom of this, you come back here and tell me who done it.<eos> Meanwhile, why don't you take that roach and shove it up your ass?<eos> - Shove it up my ass? - Yeah.<eos> Right up in there.
So we go screaming up just as the perp comes jamming out of the store. Right?<eos> Before we can even roll to a stop... Boom!<eos> He fires off a shot at us.<eos> What the fuck? You know?<eos> Just one.
Better luck next time, yes?<eos> One more thing. There's a Russian arriving at Lovelace College tomorrow for the chess tournament.<eos> It's Special Branch's bailiwick, but Division want the local force represented.<eos> You've some Russian, I believe, from your time in Signals.<eos> The barest smattering, sir.
Anything out of the ordinary?<eos> One or two points of interest.<eos> There were traces of an oil-based lotion on her face.<eos> Some kind of beauty treatment maybe?<eos> And the other?
Straightforward "accidental", then.<eos> Make a nice change for the coroner.<eos> Two drownings in one day.<eos> - That's unusual, don't you think?<eos> - Not specially.
Pleased to meet you.<eos> And Detective Constable Morse.<eos> Pleased to meet you.<eos> Do you speak Russian?<eos> Yes, a little.
What's wrong with your breakfast? There's nothing wrong with it.<eos> Just not in the mood this morning.<eos> I miss her too.<eos> I know you do.<eos> Two weeks.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you'd please take your seats, the tournament is about to continue.<eos> Morse, we've been requested to attend Cowley Baths immediately.<eos> Drowned, within the last 12 hours.<eos> Almighty lump on the back of his head too, hour or two before he died.<eos> Suspicious, then?
Give you the definitive prix fixe once I've had a rootle.<eos> Gentlemen...<eos> Who was he?<eos> Don't know. Not a regular, according to the lifeguard.<eos> What about his clothes?
So the boiler's inspected a couple of times a year by the council.<eos> I don't bother with it otherwise.<eos> It's their responsibility to make sure that the service hatch is secure.<eos> And when were they last here?<eos> Four months, maybe?
- I mean, nothing serious. - No, sir. Nothing serious.<eos> Temperament and high-spirited.<eos> There were that teacher that used to help out at the youth club of an evening.<eos> He took him under his wing, taught him chess.<eos> - Chess?
I just wanted to do something nice for him.<eos> Nothing more than that?<eos> It's always sex with the police, isn't it?<eos> A girl can't just be friends with a chap. - It's has to be sex.<eos> - Or love.
It's about your muse being just such a death-mask, cast from the features of a young woman drowned in the Seine 80 years ago.<eos> But above all, it's about finding one of your pipe-cleaner men on her bedside table.<eos> You were sleeping with her.<eos> For how long?<eos> A couple of weeks, maybe a month.
And when did you really last see her?<eos> Shortly after you left, she dropped by... briefly.<eos> Where were you the night before the chess tournament?<eos> With Tessa, at her flat.<eos> And the night before that?
Extensive third-degree burns.<eos> Could you tell us about your father's relationship to Dr Leighton-Asbury?<eos> Yes, Dad was a patient, for the best part of ten years.<eos> Did you ever go with him, out to Binsey?<eos> Once or twice.
He was going to tell Dr Amory, have you taken off the project.<eos> - That's why you killed him. - I had to.<eos> I had to kill Neilsen.<eos> She spoke to me.<eos> Through the computer, through JASON.
Alan, even great men make two or three critical mistakes in their lives.<eos> You don't get where I'm sitting by only making two or three mistakes.<eos> It's the choices you make today that will determine your future.<eos> All you have to do is say "yes."<eos> "Yes" to what, exactly?
- Sure. Copy.<eos> I'll be there.<eos> [dramatic music] Everything okay?<eos> Thank you. If you ever need anything... look me up here.<eos> ♪ Thanks for the drinks.
I don't fuckin' speak Spanish.<eos> She told him to shut the fuck up.<eos> Okay, now we can go.<eos> No, no, that... that was shots fired.<eos> What?
- Where are you going?<eos> - To seize some opportunity.<eos> That's a little vague.<eos> No one's minding the store, so I'm going exploring.<eos> Deep dive.
Phoenix! Go fly a Phoenix kite all the way to Arizona, Chang.<eos> Not your strongest, but good effort.<eos> Can I at least get Dr. Scholl's gel inserts, calcium tabs, a radio, four pencils and some honey?<eos> Throw a dog a bone.<eos> God's sake.
I guess.<eos> Have fun storming the castle!<eos> What... what castle?<eos> You get the credit card, and you swipe it through there, and then...<eos> Drugs! Drugs!
I won't be your wet blanket.<eos> Okay, so great. Huh?<eos> Moving forward.<eos> No, wait.<eos> What?
I don't think so.<eos> Hey, you ever been whacked in the head full force with a chair leg?<eos> Yeah, see, and this screw right here looks pretty rusty.<eos> I think you gonna need a shot for tetanus if you live.<eos> Oh, hell no.
Shit, what's happening? What the fuck is going on?<eos> - Justice, Ed. - Justice.<eos> Justice for what?<eos> We couldn't just let you get away with it.<eos> Not you. Not Chris Morrow. Not Andy Sikes.
I'm gonna go out on a limb here, Rezno, and say that she has evaluated the whole package, including the after-school specials and she's not really ready to dance with that, okay?<eos> So you could just stand awkwardly in front of another table.<eos> Oh, okay. Thank you for the clarity of that.<eos> That was bracing, so thank you.<eos> My pleasure.
This... is my nephew.<eos> My name is Walter and I'm a successful businessman.<eos> Nice. What line of work are you in?<eos> I could ask you the same question.<eos> Me?
Walter?<eos> Yes.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I gotta go and help with the hors d'oeuvres in the Woodside ballroom.<eos> Why?
Jakob.<eos> Are you there, Jakob?<eos> Are you listening?<eos> Jakob.
Jakob.<eos> Are you there, Jakob?<eos> Are you listening?<eos> Jakob.<eos> Jakob.
You will know her... by the love she shows to you.<eos> Let the words you speak... be the words... that call me back to you.<eos> Promise me.<eos> Promise.<eos> Jakob.
Oh... how I loved her.<eos> Jakob, was it you?<eos> If it was, then all you've done is tell me you're afraid.<eos> Ja...<eos> Jakob.
Jakob.<eos> Another woman will come.<eos> This is how... it must be.<eos> We must help her.<eos> Jakob.
I think this little guy is gonna make it.<eos> Can we keep him, mom?<eos> -I don't know.<eos> I think your father might not...<eos> Idecidedrightthenandthere
It was fun.<eos> It was.<eos> - Except for having to pay for 28 hot dogs. - excuseme.<eos> Whoa! -Yeah, you better go. You better go quick.<eos> -Okay. -Okay.
She's been looking for a respectable man.<eos> - But you'll have to do.<eos> - Right, let's get on with this. - No!<eos> Why?<eos> Why?
Father of the Year.<eos> Yeah, I'm the Father of the Year.<eos> My partner, Sean Cass, he is a courier for the Novaks.<eos> He's giving somebody in the department kickbacks.<eos> Somebody higher up.
Thank God, this place has Wi-Fi, or you would be toast right now.<eos> Thank Ganesh while you're at it.<eos> - Look, forget the flying Vulture guy.<eos> Please!<eos> - Why?
Thank Ganesh while you're at it.<eos> - Look, forget the flying Vulture guy.<eos> Please!<eos> - Why?<eos> Why?
Oxygen, 19.5%.<eos> Ankor.<eos> Nitrogen, 79.4%.<eos> Cole.<eos> Rosie.
Take a look..<eos> Something to see.<eos> Rosenthal, come in.<eos> Rosie report.<eos> Rosie?
I'm gonna taking that stone, Deliver you to Ahmanet and then my work here is done.<eos> What?<eos> Nick?<eos> Jenny?<eos> Hey, buddy.
And when is he gonna shut up, right?<eos> What? What's with the face?<eos> You're not here to say you're sorry, are you?<eos> Of course I am, but I was looking to borrow the Keshanti Key as well.<eos> Unbelievable.
You understand me?<eos> You keep me safe up there.<eos> You know it. Come on.<eos> Hey, James.<eos> Your boys good?
That doesn't work for me, Veronika.<eos> I'll just blow it all on smack.<eos> All right.<eos> I'll send it to Gail, then.<eos> And little Fergus.
It's okay.<eos> It's okay, I'm here.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> - I'm here. - I'm so sorry.<eos> Shh...
I'm here.<eos> Come on out.<eos> You couldn't even let us have her body buried properly.<eos> You coward.<eos> Why?
Why don't you show Mack some of your handiwork?<eos> Wanna take a look?<eos> Okay.<eos> Watch this one.<eos> Incredible.
What can you see in them, I wonder!<eos> They make me feel better somehow.<eos> - Yeah. - Moving on.<eos> What happened to Taft?<eos> Our nation's fattest president?
They make me feel better somehow.<eos> - Yeah. - Moving on.<eos> What happened to Taft?<eos> Our nation's fattest president?<eos> No, former associate of mine.
Go ahead.<eos> Take a look.<eos> And guess what...<eos> I'm not giving it to anyone.<eos> Just you.
I'm gonna write you up!<eos> Oh, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.<eos> Ronald?<eos> I heard you challenged Mr. Campbell to a fist fight.<eos> Why?
I'm the target - targets wait.<eos> Look, whatever's coming, whatever he's lined up, I'll know when it begins.<eos> I always know when the game is on.<eos> Do you know why?<eos> Why?
You are holding yourself to an unreasonable standard.<eos> No, I'm failing to.<eos> So there is no-one you talk to?<eos> Confide in?<eos> No-one.
I don't really need to check that the angle is consistent - with self-harm, do I?<eos> - No.<eos> Then you can keep your scars.<eos> I want to see your handbag.<eos> Why?
Oh, married an assassin!<eos> But she's, you know...<eos> - What?<eos> - Just text - her back.<eos> - Why?
Yeah, I...<eos> I am. I think I am.<eos> Not all day, not every day, but, you know.<eos> - It is what it is? - Yeah.<eos> And Rosie?
Look and play.<eos> No, not Bach.<eos> You clearly don't understand it.<eos> Play you.<eos> - Me?
What is he?<eos> Nothing more than a distraction, a little scrap of ordinariness for you to impress, to dazzle with your cleverness.<eos> You'll find another.<eos> - Please, for God's sake, just stop it.<eos> - Why?
Nice call.<eos> Your dad and I have some work to do.<eos> You wanna come up to the office and hang out with us?<eos> We'll stick your brother in the Puppy Zone... while we have a little Tim time.<eos> Tim time?
- Yeah, not if we...<eos> What?<eos> Tell?<eos> Who are you gonna tell, Tim?<eos> Your parents?
What is wrong with you?<eos> If he is a planet, how could he make a baby with your mother?<eos> He would smush her!<eos> I don't need to hear how my parents...<eos> Why?
I am Groot.<eos> What's that?<eos> He says, "Welcome to the frickin' Guardians of the Galaxy."<eos> Only he didn't use "frickin'."<eos> Bye, twig.
Did I...<eos> About the name.<eos> The name? Yeah, I told Rick.<eos> He thought it was funny.<eos> Just Rick and nobody else?
My roommate's car isn't here.<eos> We could try again.<eos> These things happen, right?<eos> Actually, not to me, they don't.<eos> Actually, not to me, either.
Don't think it. - Mom!<eos> Don't say it.<eos> Mom, shut the door! Giselle!<eos> Who did you tell?<eos> No one!
Let me help you.<eos> Whatever is going on, there's nothing you can do, okay?<eos> I literally can't tell you.<eos> I'm not going to let it happen to you, Virgil.<eos> Especially not you.
You can't spend the rest of your life alone, dressed in black, listening to angry music, and staying up all night.<eos> Yes, I can, 'cause I'm Batman.<eos> But don't you think it's time you finally faced your greatest fear?<eos> - Snakes?<eos> - Clowns?
I've been waiting to talk to you.<eos> It... It really is me.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm not gonna hurt you. which means he's going to be pulling around the corner any second he's also my guard.<eos> hey...
I don't know what's going on here, but I do know that we have a problem, and I need you in your right mind to help me figure out how to correct it.<eos> Shouldn't listen to Joy.<eos> Why are you doing this to yourself, Ward?<eos> Doing it to him.<eos> Who?
Shouldn't listen to Joy.<eos> Why are you doing this to yourself, Ward?<eos> Doing it to him.<eos> Who?<eos> Danny?
He's just finished a call, sir.<eos> To whom?<eos> Joy Meachum.<eos> And she passed the phone off to a Harold.<eos> Harold Meachum?
And Joy?<eos> How is she?<eos> Well, she's going into surgery.<eos> She'll be fine.<eos> All thanks to you.
Did you get him?<eos> Please tell me you got him.<eos> - Oh, fuck.<eos> - Fuck!<eos> - You bastard.
Just like that, man.<eos> Reach for me.<eos> Reach for me!<eos> Why?<eos> Why?
Look, I'm not looking for super friends.<eos> Yeah, you keep on telling yourself that.<eos> You came to Midland Circle for a reason.<eos> I came to help Harlem.<eos> Not you.
Yeah.<eos> Closest I ever had to family.<eos> Aside from Matty.<eos> And Elektra.<eos> - Sorry for your loss.
We're still 20 blocks away.<eos> We need to stay off the streets.<eos> Should we take a cab?<eos> - They kept my wallet.<eos> - Yeah, me, too.
What?<eos> The circumstances could be better.<eos> I'm just saying, you know, I'm glad we found each other.<eos> I'm not hugging you.<eos> You guys ready or what?
You know, maybe he's planning on having you attend just the beginning.<eos> Mae, you're in over your head.<eos> Are you leaving? Yeah.<eos> I'm really so far behind on everything, I could just die.<eos> Annie?
Oh, Mrs. Meredith parish bought these. Meredith, of course.<eos> Who is she?<eos> What does she want?<eos> She thinks all horses should be left to run free in the wild and she'll take on anybody she thinks is interfering with that.<eos> Me?
Goddamn it, Charlie, we're 30 minutes late, man.<eos> I'm so sorry I cut your back so many times, man.<eos> - What happened?<eos> - I was nervous, dude.<eos> - Why?

Watch!<eos> Resourceful.<eos> You have a lot to answer Cipher.<eos> You pulled my family through.<eos> A mother.
You have a lot to answer Cipher.<eos> You pulled my family through.<eos> A mother.<eos> I'm gonna make sure that never happens again.<eos> To anyone.
The guy doesn't leave a signature.<eos> Maybe he's not a tagger, maybe this guy's a trained artist.<eos> - Okay, yeah, sure, yeah, that fits.<eos> - And, John wear extra underpants.<eos> Why?

You present yourself as an agent of the free states of America, like a good little sheep.<eos> But long since, you've been dangled in front of the King of England by the East India Company.<eos> Now you're scrabbling, desperate.<eos> Pulling your wool over everybody's eyes.<eos> Possibly even your own.
In the jungle, no.<eos> You used to straighten your skirt and march away like nothing had ever happened.<eos> Who marched away?<eos> And thank God you did.<eos> God?
My ship is in fucking pieces, Godfrey.<eos> It is in fucking pieces.<eos> I swear, I swear I didn't know. Now report.<eos> War has begun.<eos> Sorry about your news.
"In the event of a conviction for high treason, compassing the death of our Lord the King, then the law of 'Corruption of Blood' will take precedence over all other.<eos> All land, property, chattels and investments of the guilty party will pass without hindrance to the Crown.<eos> And by dint of 'Corruption of Blood', all family members of the guilty party will be deemed corrupted and any claim to land, property, chattels or investment... will be null and void."<eos> So... you've not only delivered us Delaney, it appears you've delivered Nootka Sound to the King.<eos> Why?
What do you do when the war you're fighting just can't possibly be won in any meaningful sense?<eos> Well, obviously, you sack the guy not winning it, and you bring in some other guy.<eos> In 2009, that war was Afghanistan.<eos> And that other guy... was Glen.<eos> You boys ready?
- What?<eos> Whose phone number? This fucking Cullen fuck.<eos> Give me his fucking phone number!<eos> - I'm not gonna give you his phone number.<eos> - Why the fuck not?
Thank you.<eos> Let me walk you to your car.<eos> Okay, good.<eos> This place is awfully cute.<eos> We...
Hi, sweetie.<eos> What?<eos> Sorry, I forgot the code.<eos> Is Hugo here?<eos> Thanks to god, no thanks to you.
I do the same thing.<eos> I'm not into forgiveness either.<eos> Really?<eos> Who do you not forgive?<eos> No one.
Nothing.<eos> I can't help you.<eos> That's too bad.<eos> Then I have no use for you.<eos> Not fast enough.
- Too many?<eos> I heard a couple horses. Maybe more. Five.<eos> I, I think five at most.<eos> Three of us. Five of them.<eos> You ready?
I know every inch of that building.<eos> Every room, every corner.<eos> Hide, that's the best that we've got?<eos> We just need to keep them away from Scott for as long as possible.<eos> Why?
We need to do something.<eos> Not yet...<eos> You have to try to save everyone.<eos> How do we save you?<eos> Unbelievable.
Toto! Hey, boy.<eos> Is she...<eos> Asleep.<eos> Why are you helping me?<eos> Not you.
That is not good news.<eos> But when you appear, there seldom is.<eos> I've come to offer you a gift.<eos> A very special gift.<eos> Me.
Only that I've been waiting all day to be with you.<eos> How could you be so heartless to Jane?<eos> Please, Jack, no more politics.<eos> That woman gave her life to you.<eos> To your father.
Please...<eos> My sister... do you feel her inside you?<eos> What does she command?<eos> A message.<eos> For you.
Hurry up!<eos> Keep moving!<eos> We'll get to that, but first position all the anti-aircraft guns.<eos> Let's show the bloody hips who we are.<eos> David..
Although I shall recommend that you're nailed to one.<eos> Take the traitor away.<eos> Miss Julia, unfortunately I won't be able to attend your last show.<eos> I'm leaving for Calcutta today with the two-edged sword.<eos> Two-edged?
Listen, okay...<eos> Don't pull away. I'm worried about you.<eos> Is there any blood?<eos> Fucking blood.<eos> Unbelievable.
- Danke.<eos> - Bitte.<eos> Next!<eos> The Germans view those SIPO passes you took as just about the most valuable piece of paper a foreigner can be given.<eos> A foreigner?
That's okay. We're not judging. We're not.<eos> That's a nasty habit, though.<eos> You should have Missy take care of that for you.<eos> How?<eos> Hypnosis.
Uh, no, you know, I can just text him back.<eos> - It's you guys' night..<eos> - Hi, Rainer, this is Cassandra.<eos> - Shh.<eos> Cassie..
You'll be back before you know it, okay?<eos> Turn right up here.<eos> What?<eos> Ryan, just turn right.<eos> - Why?
Long-term, I'm actually doing my Web site now.<eos> Eventually, I want to keep doing it, but, I mean, if something else comes up, that'd be cool too, but...<eos> I want to eventually, like, hire people to do it for me, so, like, I don't have to do it anymore, you know what I mean?<eos> Like, have my own site and pay girls to do stuff.<eos> Or men.
Call me back, or at least text me.<eos> What, Clay? What do you want?<eos> - We need to talk. - No, we don't.<eos> We have to tell someone about Justin.<eos> Mr. Porter? Really?
- You are such a fucking asshole! - Hey! - Come on!<eos> Hey! - How could you do that to me?<eos> - What did you tell him?<eos> - What did I tell who?<eos> Mr. Porter!
I don't want to hear it, Tony.<eos> I feel you, brother, but still. That shit's not helping.<eos> I don't want to help.<eos> I... want to hurt.<eos> Hurt who?
Like just a reason to put posters up.<eos> I'm trying to help the school heal.<eos> The school?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What about you?
I'm trying to help the school heal.<eos> The school?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What about you?<eos> Yes, all of us.
I didn't understand it.<eos> I still don't.<eos> Yeah, well, welcome to the world.<eos> Well, I hate it.<eos> Me too.
Can someone tell me? I mean, he's a rapist.<eos> Jesus, keep your voice down.<eos> I published a poem. He's a rapist.<eos> Stop using that word.<eos> Why?
And I'm not gonna let them pin this on our staff or on you and Jane and me.<eos> So... you think that this is where they're headed?<eos> Apparently, they've expedited the subpoenas.<eos> - For the kids?<eos> - For all of us.
Like... I don't care anymore.<eos> You don't care about what?<eos> About anything.<eos> School.<eos> Myself.
You don't look fine.<eos> Daddy?<eos> I need to tell you...<eos> Something happened.<eos> To me.
No.<eos> [Sniffles] Vonda N. Mclntyre.<eos> Th-This will be satisfactory.<eos> [Sniffles]<eos> You hungry?
We're out of pickles.<eos> What about potato chips?<eos> We got chips. Number 42 makes them.<eos> Number 42 is a coding system for persons here?<eos> For the workers, yeah.
Russell, Jay Kulina calling, trying you again.<eos> I think I have another property that you will love.<eos> Actually, scratch that.<eos> I know you're gonna love it.<eos> Why?
- I'm ready to fuck him up.<eos> - Sounds good to me.<eos> All right.<eos> That's it, Ryan! Go to work!<eos> You ready?
What are you doin'?<eos> I'm lying in bed.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Lying on the floor.<eos> Why?
I hope it feels like that.<eos> I've never hit anybody in the face.<eos> You'd love it.<eos> Don't you feel bad?<eos> - About what?
I hope I had nothing to do with that.<eos> Oh, God, Dad, that is not your burden to bear.<eos> I feel terrible that I misjudged you.<eos> This is gonna be good for Jerry.<eos> For everybody.
Oh, God, Dad, that is not your burden to bear.<eos> I feel terrible that I misjudged you.<eos> This is gonna be good for Jerry.<eos> For everybody.<eos> For everybody.
I mean, w-w-what... what are we vindicating?<eos> Comfort?<eos> Rick, this really bums me out.<eos> It-It's embarrassing to find out these guys don't like us.<eos> Why?
Trust me, for that conversation, there is no 'good time'.<eos> As I'm sure that we both remember.<eos> You broke my heart.<eos> You broke mine first.<eos> Unbelievable.
Well, I'm afraid it's not convenient.<eos> Why's that?<eos> Is she busy?<eos> It's not possible now, Mr. Anderssen.<eos> - Why?
They'll come.<eos> Company, fall into two ranks!<eos> Make ready!<eos> Present!<eos> Ready!
With Stella, and the business...<eos> And I just wanna say, I'm proud of you, and you don't owe me anything.<eos> Well, I gotta say, it's a huge relief.<eos> With the week I'm having, and after all these years.<eos> Me, too.
Listen to me. Bubee, relax.<eos> I understand.<eos> These are hard lessons. But you know what?<eos> You're gonna thank us one day. Us?<eos> What...
The pressure I'm under...<eos> Now this.<eos> No, we both feel it.<eos> Not knowing who to trust.<eos> Me.
- Thank you.<eos> - Oh, don't thank me.<eos> Simply deliver a message when the time comes.<eos> A message? - To who?<eos> - To the wicked.
Those pork chops were delightful.<eos> I, uh...<eos> Yeah, she's a hell of a cook.<eos> I'm not sure we can trust the Jew.<eos> - Who?
- Who?<eos> - Feltz.<eos> There's been some sneaking around.<eos> Do you trust him?<eos> Sy?
No, it's too early to fry the onions.<eos> Assaf likes them crisp.<eos> No, no, it's not perfect.<eos> More cinnamon.<eos> Assaf?
Hey, how much do you think I could get for my book?<eos> Shit.<eos> Stacy got 15 for hers.<eos> All the big wigs in yours, you could double that.<eos> Why?
What matter is that we do it.<eos> And if we're lucky, we're really, really lucky, we get a minute or two to enjoy a nice hot cup of tea.<eos> Good.<eos> Tammy asked me to meet her here.<eos> Me, too.
Don't be shy.<eos> You like helping people, don't you?<eos> Yes, when I can.<eos> Could you help me?<eos> You?
What's that?<eos> That you kill Soleràs.<eos> What?<eos> You heard me.<eos> Why?
The informant is off-limits.<eos> So how do we talk to him?<eos> We don't.<eos> We'll be given written summaries of statements he made to his handlers.<eos> His handlers?
Is it Valhalla you want?<eos> In time, Lord.<eos> - Freedom would be my first choice.<eos> - Who do you serve?<eos> The brothers, Sigefrid and Erik.
Is it your intention to build an army?<eos> Oh, last night I was still a slave.<eos> Build an army and I will command it, but only if it's your intention to go against all the lords of the north Kjartan.<eos> But also the brothers and the man who stole my land.<eos> My own uncle!
- Okay. - I needed to make sure...<eos> - Who did you see?<eos> That doesn't matter.<eos> You won't tell me, but you'll tell Laurie?<eos> Who else? Matt?
Then we can talk.<eos> Ben and I fought together.<eos> And we swore an oath<eos> - to our country - No.<eos> and to each other.
Get ready.<eos> We're 30 seconds out.<eos> Do you miss it?<eos> What?<eos> The action.
We were always moving, you know?<eos> Living in different places.<eos> That must've been hard.<eos> I didn't mind.<eos> Because of the trees.
Time for another.<eos> Never thought I'd say this, but these make me miss the heroin.<eos> - God, I miss...<eos> - this.<eos> Me, too.
Will you answer a question honestly?<eos> As honestly as I can.<eos> Are you helping me because undermining Mandiba's control over this city is good for your business interests?<eos> The easiest decisions in this world are those where what is good for business is also good for your family.<eos> F... Family?
He's hunting.<eos> I was looking for this.<eos> So you told him?<eos> - No, not yet.<eos> - Why?
And no matter what you do, I will find Ms. Gunnarsdottir.<eos> And I will enjoy feeling you experience her death... inch by inch, piece by piece.<eos> There's just one tiny problem with that plan.<eos> And what is that?<eos> Me.
This old sucker's a lot more secure than you thought it was.<eos> A.J.: Wait, wait. Maybe...<eos> - [lock clicks]<eos> Look at at that.<eos> Ready?
Wait!<eos> She wouldn't kill herself.<eos> I told her.<eos> - You told who?<eos> - Norma.
You traveled to the past and gave this to her?<eos> Well, actually, her past, my future, it's...<eos> That's how she knew she would see me again.<eos> Okay, that makes my head spin.<eos> Mine, too.
I'm at home.<eos> Why?<eos> Lianne with you?<eos> Yeah, it's my weekend.<eos> Why?
- Justice!<eos> - When do we want it?<eos> - Now!<eos> - What do we want?<eos> - Justice!
- What do we want?<eos> - Justice!<eos> - When do we want it?<eos> - Now! - What do we want?<eos> - Justice!
Oh, thank you, honey.<eos> So, uh, since it's kind of a foreign thing to her,<eos> I don't think Lily's totally down with the whole... baptism thing.<eos> He has to be baptized.<eos> - Why?
I'll take care of it.<eos> It's gonna be fine.<eos> You get such amazing light in here.<eos> It's one of the things I love most about it.<eos> Hey, sweetie.
Work, Dr. Hodgins.<eos> Work comes next.<eos> What have you gotten?<eos> Well, there's no flesh or clothing, but thanks to my esteemed colleague, John George Haigh, I was able to estimate how long our victim was in the acid.<eos> John George Haigh?
I figured if I waited here long enough, you'd show up.<eos> It's safe for us?<eos> Does this mean you've thought about things?<eos> That, uh, you're gonna help me?<eos> Not you.
It's safe for us?<eos> Does this mean you've thought about things?<eos> That, uh, you're gonna help me?<eos> Not you.<eos> This kid.
Dr. Wyatt. Mmm.<eos> So good to see you again.<eos> Why are you wandering around with that cart?<eos> Oh, well, Agent Booth suggested I take up residence in the conference room, but as you can see, it's occupied.<eos> Yeah, sorry about that.
For Hodgins.<eos> To the bride and groom!<eos> Wait, wait, wait. Whoa, whoa. Whoa!<eos> Careful, Dr. Saroyan. Don't hurt yourself.<eos> Or anyone else.
Yeah, I think so.<eos> And, you know, Stiles wouldn't be okay with this.<eos> If he knew all the things that we were trying to do without him, he'd, he'd kill us.<eos> I think he'd be okay.<eos> With this?
And, you know, Stiles wouldn't be okay with this.<eos> If he knew all the things that we were trying to do without him, he'd, he'd kill us.<eos> I think he'd be okay.<eos> With this?<eos> With us...
You didn't even have a scratch.<eos> Yeah, I remember, because it was, like, five minutes ago.<eos> Why would Nolan do that?<eos> He's afraid.<eos> - Of me?
Oh. Really leaving?<eos> They want a decision by tomorrow.<eos> When you showed up here in Rosewood, I...<eos> Really thought we're gonna get another chance at this.<eos> At us.
Cure 'em and then wake 'em up?<eos> Did you ever stop to think, Hope might be better off without 'em?<eos> I made a promise.<eos> To who?<eos> To Elijah?
Did you ever stop to think, Hope might be better off without 'em?<eos> I made a promise.<eos> To who?<eos> To Elijah?<eos> To my daughter.
Fine.<eos> Good.<eos> Then get the hell out of my sight.<eos> I can't believe this.<eos> Jeannie?
I believe you.<eos> I believe you.<eos> I believe you!<eos> I have to take the test again?<eos> Why?
Beth.<eos> - Everything OK?<eos> - That is your dad's boat?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why?
Seems like we found our way into The Widow's heart.<eos> Who are you?<eos> I'm a friend of M.K.'s.<eos> Maybe the only friend he has left in the world, now that Sunny's charged off to some tragically noble end.<eos> No thanks to you, of course.
No, you're afraid we're going to sue...<eos> You know, for negligence and punitive damages for not providing adequate security to your students.<eos> We simply wanted to check how you're doing.<eos> Wes was a close friend of yours.<eos> Not that close, really.
I'll kill you.<eos> Relax, will you?<eos> I'm getting pretty tired of chasing Outis.<eos> - Always being behind him.<eos> - Me, too.
Did you learn it... or was it ingrained in you?<eos> It was ingrained in you, son.<eos> You got it from me.<eos> Linc, he's here.<eos> - My son.
Arthur, he's a junkie.<eos> Those are track marks.<eos> Heroin hasn't been around for years.<eos> - Then he's selling plasma.<eos> - To who?
Valentine...<eos> I see you've met Jeremy.<eos> The others are gearing up for tonight's mission.<eos> You should get ready.<eos> - Mission?
I don't think obese tuna sounds any better.<eos> You know, as much as I love Tokyo and Prague, a bacon burger from the East Village isn't that bad.<eos> The world is your oyster, Alexander.<eos> - I got you something.<eos> - Me?
No, you didn't.<eos> I would never willingly let a vampire taste my blood.<eos> Do you have any idea what you've done?<eos> - I saved a life.<eos> - A monster's life.
Awake already?<eos> Come near me and I'll kill you.<eos> You don't deserve this. But Shadowhunters need to feel what it's like to lose the ones that they love.<eos> My brother Samuel was all I had in this world... and now he's gone!<eos> Thanks to your brother, Jace.
Strange being back here.<eos> You remember S.T.A.R Labs?<eos> I remember everything.<eos> This is where we came up with the cerebral inhibitor to use against DeVoe.<eos> Who?
Got no call to cut me off long as he's buying.<eos> Pour yourself one.<eos> It's on him.<eos> That okay with you?<eos> Why the fuck not?
I just heard a couple of kids trying to figure out who was pregnant in our class.<eos> Luckily for me, Natalie put on a few pounds this year.<eos> How could you do that?<eos> To me?<eos> To Jesus?
Oh, just sit down.<eos> Are you firing me?<eos> Oh, Rene, there was a time when I would have loved to hear you ask me that, but, no, I am not firing you.<eos> I want to talk to you about... Zoe.<eos> Yeah, your daughter.
It's just a temporary fix.<eos> I'll have to run more comprehensive diagnostics.<eos> You guys are gonna have to explain to me how all this works one day.<eos> You really don't want them to do that.<eos> Nerdapalooza.
No pressure or anything.<eos> Is this the video you said your father left for you?<eos> He left one for Thea, too.<eos> I never showed it to her.<eos> Why not?
And, you know, Captain, I think it's a little too coincidental that we got those calls just when they were coming to get Burkhardt.<eos> He broke out before they could get him to the North Precinct.<eos> What?<eos> My guess is, Burkhardt had some help.<eos> Nick?
I want to be friends, Simon.<eos> And I'm willing to wait.<eos> I'm a very patient woman.<eos> I don't like that guy.<eos> Who, Jace?
No, no.<eos> Just processing.<eos> Um, what else did God tell you to do?<eos> You shouldn't trust him...<eos> - Grimnir.
People do tend to behave if they know they're being watched.<eos> They like being watched.<eos> Somebody's watching. Somebody's always watching.<eos> What did you do to become the god of this little universe that you have created?<eos> Sacrifice.
Had.<eos> Quite a bit.<eos> Held it in keeping.<eos> Drank my share but delivered the balance on time where it was meant.<eos> To who?
Quite a bit.<eos> Held it in keeping.<eos> Drank my share but delivered the balance on time where it was meant.<eos> To who?<eos> The King.
This rescue gonna be the toughest thing you ever done.<eos> And Noah gonna be able to help.<eos> I'll get him back.<eos> Together, we're gonna get the rest of my family.<eos> All up now!
And Noah gonna be able to help.<eos> I'll get him back.<eos> Together, we're gonna get the rest of my family.<eos> All up now!<eos> All up now!
Help me.<eos> Of course.<eos> How?<eos> He's not to be trusted.<eos> Who?
Father. How can I help you? What can I do?<eos> Find me, my son.<eos> I cannot rest until I lay underground once more.<eos> He cannot be trusted!<eos> Who?
Isabella is over on the other side with us.<eos> Whispering tales of murder.<eos> Dark plots are in motion, my son.<eos> Don't trust him!<eos> Who?
Whispering tales of murder.<eos> Dark plots are in motion, my son.<eos> Don't trust him!<eos> Who?<eos> The birthday boy.
He and all the other human garbage that plague this city.<eos> All will be tried, convicted and executed!<eos> I will purge Gotham, and the innocents will thank me!<eos> Their savior!<eos> Their executioner.
Oh, Bruce? Where are you, boy?<eos> Come on out, boy.<eos> I won't hurt ya.<eos> Bruce, darling.<eos> Oh, Brucie...
Thank you.<eos> I wonder how long you will be the public face of grief when people hear that you killed your best friend.<eos> And then there are your extracurricular activities.<eos> How many are we up to now?<eos> Five?
Ed, if there is any part of your mind that is not insane, listen to me.<eos> You need help.<eos> Turn yourself in.<eos> My actions seem... mad to you?<eos> To anyone.
No problem.<eos> Um... there's something off about him.<eos> No argument there.<eos> I don't trust him.<eos> Gabe?
Their son.<eos> He was not harmed.<eos> That, at least, is something.<eos> All this time, Bruce, the Court was never more than a means to an end, allowing us to maintain order in Gotham.<eos> Us?
Things could've gone so differently, James.<eos> We could've cleaned this town up together.<eos> But when the moment came, you stood against me.<eos> You stood against Gotham.<eos> Against justice.
What? The article?<eos> I think you should be really proud.<eos> It's the beginning of... an amazing journalistic legacy.<eos> Really?<eos> How amazing?
- Yeah. - He's been kidnapped.<eos> He... I didn't know.<eos> I'm so s...<eos> - I thought...<eos> - Sorry about that.
Great, yeah, that's, uh that's awesome.<eos> I, um... I thought she'd be more excited than that.<eos> Hey, Julian, would you maybe be able to cover for me at work for the next few days?<eos> Few days?<eos> Why?
I respect your decision.<eos> Don't screw it up.<eos> Okay, that was weird.<eos> I guess that this means that we gotta find you a place.<eos> Me? More like us.
We tracked him here and followed.<eos> Okay, but why would he come to this Earth?<eos> Well, we believe... for you.<eos> - Me?<eos> Why?
Anyway, I mean, what are we... supposed to do?<eos> What do you think this... Music Meister needs us to do now?<eos> Uh... Ah, there you are!<eos> You two ready?<eos> Ready for...
After all this time, now?<eos> Uh, Joe, um... I'm doing my best.<eos> What happened to us?<eos> My daughter's life was taken.<eos> My son's.
I went to the future.<eos> My future self told me that he created time remnants to stop you.<eos> But you slaughtered them all.<eos> All but one.<eos> Me.
- Yeah, I got to... - Hey, yeah.<eos> I'll... yeah, later. Okay.<eos> Docket number CC-15-204.<eos> Evidentiary hearing for Central City versus the defendant,<eos> Lucious Coolidge.

- Well, should I stop them?<eos> Let them take it.<eos> No speed gun can stop a God.<eos> My guess is the power source is most likely here.<eos> Why there?
That's a good question.<eos> Sybil called me back here.<eos> She wants that ball of iron I've been lugging around.<eos> For the first time, I was actually able to tell her no.<eos> Because of this.
Who's looking for the bell right now?<eos> Fine.<eos> I'm working with Matt. Good.<eos> I was hoping Caroline would rope him in.<eos> - Why?
You've only been this person for two days.<eos> Why don't you give yourself a chance to discover who you are now?<eos> Then you'll know how to help the people that you've hurt.<eos> Because I think that means leaving Mystic Falls.<eos> Alone.

But what if they can't?<eos> They will find her.<eos> I promise you.<eos> Some of our best people are on it.<eos> Chug! Chug!

Well, he's already out on bail, but the good news is, he does have an ankle bracelet so he can't get far.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> We should go.<eos> They think they can keep me down.<eos> Me!
We're here to talk, that's it.<eos> We come in peace.<eos> Just hear us out.<eos> We heard what happened to your family.<eos> My family?
Working on it.<eos> Well, go get 'em, Eileen.<eos> That's the plan.<eos> Bye, Sam.<eos> Bye.
I'm just trying to make that happen.<eos> Yes, well, things change.<eos> And that means?<eos> This...<eos> Nephilim.
Well, only what the police said.<eos> That it was at the party and it was late in the evening.<eos> Oh, Christ.<eos> Listen, um... you know me and Cath will be there for Trish,<eos> and for you, mate.
Aidan shall return with you.<eos> You will treat him well, you will feed him well. For the entire winter, should that be necessary.<eos> I do not eat too much.<eos> Finally, you will deliver a message, from me to Kjartan.<eos> Kjartan?
But he must see all the proof we have against her.<eos> I'm still waiting for the results of the DNA comparison.<eos> Have you told anyone else about your suspicions, anyone at all?<eos> Not even Vincent Rattrey?<eos> No, not even Vincent.
Mom's always 30% less annoying when you're around. They'd love it. I'd love it.<eos> And you are aware that pretty much all of these people are superficial assholes.<eos> No, they're not.<eos> Look... I promise I will follow you wherever you want to go when you fall in love with a guy, okay?<eos> Or a girl.
Well, I hate to break it to you, but you're on the hook here, Joey.<eos> Manny's gotta go.<eos> You--<eos> You said cancer.<eos> Before then.
Nitro pills. Your boss has heart problems.<eos> You already got it all figured out, why're you asking?<eos> Hector keeps the pills in his coat pocket.<eos> When he hangs up his coat, I'll make the switch.<eos> Mm.
It's hard.<eos> Very, very hard.<eos> I'm just having a rough time.<eos> I just need a break.<eos> Just one break.
I remember Lauren.<eos> Good to see you again, Kim.<eos> This is Jack Sweet, our new CFO.<eos> - Oh, hello.<eos> - Pleasure.
We can monitor you from the control center at all times.<eos> Now the chassis is armored with a proprietary Reeves Industries ultra-hard alloy.<eos> It can handle anything under a 50 cal.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why not?
And it impairs my ability to secure future work.<eos> The only thing impairing your ability is a fifth of vodka.<eos> This is sad, Joan.<eos> I'm sad for you.<eos> - For me?
That's what we're about to find out.<eos> Daniel Bishop, you know Tom Keen.<eos> He and Matias Solomon were on the plane together.<eos> I want to thank you for saving the lives of everyone on board.<eos> Almost everyone.
- I tried to talk to you.<eos> I did everything that I could to get you to listen to me.<eos> If something terrible did happen to that plane,<eos> I don't blame you for that.<eos> Me?
I wasn't even working at these times.<eos> So, if Ms. Carlson didn't make the payments, then it must've been you.<eos> Gotcha.<eos> I'm sorry it ended this way.<eos> Yeah, me too.
Isn't your wife an agent?<eos> Fiancée, technically.<eos> We would be married... if Scottie hadn't ordered Solomon to shoot up our wedding.<eos> And yet, here you are.<eos> Why?
He got out?<eos> Get a response unit down there.<eos> Tell them not to use deadly force.<eos> We're in position.<eos> Ready on your go.
One of yours.<eos> I no longer work for Iran.<eos> You know that, because you are the one that turned me 14 years ago in exchange for my life.<eos> Since then, I have been working for you... For Mossad...<eos> Against Iran.
- You just did it again.<eos> - Who else have you told?<eos> - About Sangravan?<eos> About my daughter.<eos> No one.
- Yeah, she can crash with me.<eos> - No, no, you just moved in.<eos> - No, no problem.<eos> - Friends, family member, somebody you can trust?<eos> Why?
You're in a very good place right now, mr.<eos> Andrews.<eos> Varsity football, ap music tutorials.<eos> This morning, in the hallway, you wouldn't meet my eyes.<eos> Why?
Tonight's pep rally isn't like any other we've had in the past.<eos> And we shouldn't pretend that it is.<eos> Which is why i would like to dedicate this evening<eos> To the memory of one of our brightest.<eos> Jason blossom.
Bulldog twenty-five, on two. Bulldog twenty-five, on two.<eos> - Ready? - Break!<eos> Red 32.<eos> Red 32.<eos> Ready?
I am here for you, whenever. But why didn't you call the cops or animal control services?<eos> It was a message... for me from the Serpents.<eos> I didn't call the police because I don't trust them.<eos> I don't trust half the people in this damn town.<eos> Just you.
Well, I was just, um, telling your mother...<eos> You know that SoDale contract?<eos> It was awarded to Andrews Construction.<eos> The buyer, whoever they are, they approved us.<eos> Thanks to my lucky charm.
It'll be a bloodbath!<eos> They've been the Hatfields and the McCoys since long before Polly was pregnant.<eos> Plus, I'm trying to avoid the Blossoms.<eos> If they find out your father is the one who bought the drive-in, it'll be open war.<eos> Against us?
The Sixth Amendment guarantees the defendant's right to confront all witnesses against him.<eos> How is Mr. Boustani supposed to confront Ms. Rafiq if he can't see her face?<eos> The First Amendment.<eos> It guarantees everyone...<eos> Even the witness...
And I expected you to convict Jafar Boustani because of who he is, not because of what he did.<eos> Now, my mistake at the time was I forgot that that's not what great Americans do.<eos> Great Americans look to the law that binds us together as a people.<eos> They ignore what their gut tells them is right, choosing instead what we as a civilized society have collectively determined is the right thing to do.<eos> Why?
Open it, Jason.<eos> Now we call the cops.<eos> ...during a very challenging semester.<eos> We would particularly like to thank the President of the Board,<eos> Harold Smerconish.
Not about that. It's...<eos> Then what's it about?<eos> I'm gonna help you out with a lot of things, norman.<eos> Help you out with everything...<eos> Everything.
Listen...<eos> - I am listening.<eos> Please explain your address to this taxi driver.<eos> Address?<eos> Taxi-driver?
- No. Okay.<eos> Is this?<eos> - Sister-in-law, there's someone in my life. What?<eos> Let me see.<eos> Sister-in-law! Sister-in-law!
Is this?<eos> - Sister-in-law, there's someone in my life. What?<eos> Let me see.<eos> Sister-in-law! Sister-in-law!<eos> Sister-in-law!
Didn't Adi go with you?<eos> He's sleeping in his room.<eos> I am really scared of this boy.<eos> He wants perfection in everything.<eos> - What Perfection?
To make scansion.<eos> Christopher, Jennifer.<eos> Same amount of syllables.<eos> Something wrong?<eos> Something wrong?
Bravo, George.<eos> Help me up, Mrs Turner.<eos> The chair would be easier.<eos> I'm walking in.<eos> Jessie?
Bless him.<eos> Oh, er, what's for tea then?<eos> Dunno. What do you fancy?<eos> Anything as long as it's not rice pudding.<eos> Oh, Reggie.
Oh, Phyllis!<eos> I've spent a lot of time wanting to be with someone, now I have the opportunity I'm not sure I have the gumption.<eos> Failure isn't fatal, but hesitation can be.<eos> Give yourself a chance.<eos> And him.
Families would have my picture... hanging in their dining rooms.<eos> Little kids would tell their teachers they want to be me when they grow up... me...<eos> And not just the gay ones.<eos> I mean, every last little boy and girl in this country... would be looking up to me.<eos> Me. I.
A mother.<eos> With him 15 years.<eos> What did my mother make him do?<eos> Fire her.<eos> Why?
- Are you sure you wanna leave like this?<eos> - Yeah. No, are you kidding me?<eos> We need to go now, Erin.<eos> - Baby, it's okay.<eos> - No. Sorry.
In his hiatus, he developed much more powerful and sophisticated bombs, and they keep coming.<eos> Exxon Valdez's PR guy, Mosser, and just last week, Gil Murray in Sacramento.<eos> It took three body bags to collect the parts.<eos> Why these targets?<eos> Why now?
But let's think about mail bombs.<eos> He can't hear them, he can't see them, he can't visit the site, he can't view the bodies, anything.<eos> It's none of the satisfaction of revenge.<eos> But he keeps bombing anyway.<eos> Why?
I'm not sure you'd be safe here.<eos> Oh, I will return, dear Spider.<eos> - One last time. - My lady--<eos> I have to die in this strange country.<eos> Just like you.
So many men have tried to kill me, I don't remember all their names.<eos> I have been sold like a broodmare.<eos> I've been chained and betrayed, raped and defiled.<eos> Do you know what kept me standing through all those years in exile?<eos> Faith.
I tried.<eos> You wouldn't be here if you tried.<eos> Murderer!<eos> Whores!<eos> Traitor!
The Lord of Light never spoke to me.<eos> I don't know anything about him.<eos> I don't know what he wants from me.<eos> He wants you alive.<eos> - Why?
For the night is dark and full of terrors.<eos> We'll all freeze soon.<eos> I saw the water.<eos> When you killed the white walker, almost all the dead that followed it fell.<eos> Why?
Anything you say, Professor Chambers.<eos> My hero.<eos> What the--?<eos> Aaron.<eos> Why?
My hero.<eos> What the--?<eos> Aaron.<eos> Why?<eos> Why now?
Your blood was the key.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> Unfortunately, increasing the toxicity means it can't be administered via gas anymore.<eos> So it's back to the old needle, I'm afraid.<eos> My apologies.
We should have him there in ten minutes.<eos> He's okay?<eos> Promise?<eos> He's stable. You can come with us, but we can only take one of you.<eos> Ready?
Feet on the line. Hands through the slot.<eos> Would it be possible to get a pen and paper? Please?<eos> Feet on the line, hands through the slot.<eos> Or do you want me to tell your visitor to go screw herself?<eos> Visitor?
But enough to go rattle his cage.<eos> Coming?<eos> Am I invited?<eos> You can thank Robertson.<eos> Why Robertson?
He never once asked to see you.<eos> Lidocaine HCL, a local anesthetic.<eos> It should numb the pain.<eos> What movie did you see that in?<eos> No movie.
You sure are.<eos> I'm gonna keep praying for you.<eos> We should get together sometime.<eos> I'd like that.<eos> Yeah, me too.
I'll show you.<eos> Okay.<eos> Don't look down the hallway.<eos> Just stare in your locker.<eos> Why?
- Please, go on.<eos> Everyone else is. - Nothing.<eos> It's just... maybe it's okay to push the envelope.<eos> There's no harm in cutting loose.<eos> Why?
But for what it's worth, I think you're dead wrong.<eos> I think you're so damn strong.<eos> And I'm thankful for that... every day.<eos> We want to talk to you.<eos> Why?
Well, he left in the night.<eos> But he'll be back.<eos> Oh, my goodness.<eos> I feel so bad for Rayna.<eos> Yeah, the girls too.
No.<eos> What would you have done if you couldn't do music?<eos> Die. (chuckles)<eos> - I envy you.<eos> - Why?
Grab a slightly overcooked dinner here.<eos> So, Daph, how'd it go today?<eos> Your session?<eos> She thinks she knows why I'm so messed up.<eos> Why?
I'll leave you to it.<eos> Why'd you want to meet me here?<eos> Because there are reporters outside of my door.<eos> I can't get home.<eos> So sorry.
And then what?<eos> The truth is, the label survived on Rayna's fame.<eos> What she brought in subsidized everybody else.<eos> Alyssa's whole mission is to put us on a path that would be sustainable for years to come.<eos> Yeah, with music, though, right?
They go live at 2:35, and I'll be there at 2:00, thanks.<eos> How many interviews is that?<eos> - Three.<eos> - That's fantastic.<eos> Why?
Look, I understand you'll never trust me.<eos> Gunnar, stop this.<eos> But have you ever truly trusted anybody?<eos> Okay, I'm not doing this now, not here.<eos> Me?
I'm sorry.<eos> You fucking hate this place!<eos> Why are you here?<eos> Your grandfather left it to me.<eos> To you?
Why are you here?<eos> Your grandfather left it to me.<eos> To you?<eos> Not to Nina?<eos> To me.
Since we're sharing secrets and all.<eos> I'm not the one running for Vice President, Jake.<eos> Of course not. That would be beneath you.<eos> You have a good evening, Liv.<eos> You, too.
- What? You're not sitting with me?<eos> - Keep your voice down.<eos> You're sitting with me.<eos> No, James, I am not.<eos> Unbelievable.
Days.<eos> Were you scared?<eos> And then you fought alongside josephus Miller, huh?<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> Beratnas.
Well, that's the trouble with someone who talks for a living.<eos> Sometimes they just don't know when to shut up.<eos> Freddie says you were with Stan when he...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Me too.
Then let's go to trial on the murder charges.<eos> Anita, We're having this conversation because you can't prove he killed her at all, unintentionally or otherwise.<eos> This case should never have been brought.<eos> DNA from a consensual sexual encounter, no witnesses, a timeline you could drive a Corvette through, no history of aberrant behavior on Mr. Holland's part.<eos> Thanks to your witness tampering.
What you know about Kunta Kinte?<eos> Boy, don't even get me started.<eos> - I'm sorry. - It's all right.<eos> Why do you let him treat you like this?<eos> Edwin?
Say something!<eos> - Say something, God damn it.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> That's all you got?<eos> You sorry?
There's nothing going on between me and him!<eos> Okay. Just make sure to let me know when the two of you start dating.<eos> Okay, here's a lollipop.<eos> See you next time.<eos> Oh, Cassie.
Really?<eos> She worked here for the better part of a year.<eos> Your desk.<eos> Hey, Betsy, have you seen Jennifer?<eos> Um, sorry.
Gonna be a nice haul...<eos> Our agreement was 10%.<eos> Take 20, skim the best.<eos> But these supplies, they're desperately needed...<eos> Yeah, by us.
- Why?<eos> - I felt like I needed it.<eos> - Do you?<eos> - Well, it saved my life.<eos> And mine.
Okay, well, we'll call you later.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - I like the new place.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - Me too.
I just couldn't do it.<eos> I could not kill my son again.<eos> Get away from me!<eos> I'm so sorry... son.<eos> Me... too...
Yeah, it was me.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> How did you get in here?<eos> The stick.
It did gladden the heart to see how 'ee live now, Sister -- in such contentment and with so fine a gent as Cap'n Poldark.<eos> Yes, Brother.<eos> Truly, I am blessed.<eos> Tell Father that I'll pray for him.<eos> Morwenna!
When you married Andrew, against the wishes of your family, did you not vow to take his part in all things?<eos> - Yes, of course, but...<eos> - Well, I vowed likewise.<eos> I am Warleggan now and must take my husband's part.<eos> Even against Ross?
- Yes, of course, but...<eos> - Well, I vowed likewise.<eos> I am Warleggan now and must take my husband's part.<eos> Even against Ross?<eos> Especially against Ross?
No, but at least not be in such haste.<eos> See if anything can be heard by other means.<eos> As you wish.<eos> You agree?<eos> Why?
Naturally.<eos> Therein lies the problem.<eos> You should be aware that if you decline this role, it will be offered elsewhere...<eos> Nevertheless, I do decline.<eos> .. to Mr George Warleggan.
Yes!<eos> Did you glean anything from the Frenchmen?<eos> Nothing I didn't already know.<eos> I didn't wish to distress Caroline, but the Comte de Sombreuil thinks we should prepare for the worst.<eos> Why?
Be ready and heave!<eos> Heave!<eos> Heave!<eos> See, I tell'd 'ee, young Cap'n, we'd soon be off on another jaunt.<eos> Ready?
Heave!<eos> Heave!<eos> See, I tell'd 'ee, young Cap'n, we'd soon be off on another jaunt.<eos> Ready?<eos> Ready?
- Tholly.<eos> - I'm ready, willing and able.<eos> - Tholly. Well, if he won't, I will.<eos> I must apologise for my servant, mademoiselle.<eos> - Servant?
A farm t' run an' a mine beside?<eos> How th' menfolk 'ave th' cheek to expect us t' do their bidding'!<eos> Lucky we never do.<eos> I'm still livid at Ross's insolence.<eos> I, too.
I might have done had Lord Falmouth not mentioned his nephew is a prisoner of war.<eos> I felt it would be tactless to refer to French prisons at all, let alone Ross' intention to storm one!<eos> So our mission has failed.<eos> We're leaving.<eos> Morwenna?
That's it.<eos> Heave. One, two, three, heave.<eos> Make fast.<eos> Secure it at the back. Be quick about it. Quick about it.<eos> Ready?
I don't blame him.<eos> I don't trust him yet, either.<eos> We gotta throw smurf a cut.<eos> I mean, not like usual, but something.<eos> Why?
What do you say we both act as interim managing partners?<eos> I'd be honored.<eos> It seems to me, the first order of business is, what are we gonna do about the name of the firm?<eos> I don't know about you, but... I think we should keep it exactly the same.<eos> Me too.
Hobbs is suggesting that in exchange for ending criminal proceedings today, Mr. Bloom admit to hiring his brother and serve life in prison without parole.<eos> But considering her client was looking at the death penalty, it's a win for Rothman, too.<eos> If Mr. Bloom agrees to this, it is a very big win for everyone.<eos> Hey. Do you have a second?<eos> Why?
You're okay.<eos> That hurt, Dad.<eos> You have to be tougher, Amir.<eos> What happens when I'm not here to protect you any more, huh?<eos> Why?
Can you remember what happened?<eos> Not really.<eos> We must have burst a tire or something.<eos> Wow, you're lucky.<eos> - Hm. - We?
- You said it to the dogs.<eos> - Like a minute ago.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> You guys like roller coasters?<eos> - Unbelievable.
Is that what you want me to do?<eos> Yes, if you could.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I don't know how you managed it, But the geofencing software that chief davis let us use. Will save an amazing amount of time.<eos> Why?
Yes, shoes.<eos> We can't forget the shoes.<eos> And we're going to need a murderer, too, Or we are gonna have even bigger problems ahead of us.<eos> Hey, mark. When your grandmother gets here, I want you to treat her with kindness and respect.<eos> Why?
I mean, some animal tries to rape me and I'm able to pull my knife and cut his penis off, damn right I'd tell people.<eos> I can't tell if you're trying to trap me or not.<eos> I'm not.<eos> Yeah, I told some friends.<eos> Who?
He was murdered.<eos> If you ever want to become a real cop, James...<eos> Now's the time to start talking.<eos> And who would that be good for?<eos> For you guys?
Would it kill you to open a window?<eos> Where the hell have you been?<eos> I've been looking for you everywhere.<eos> You have to come here from now on, if you want your bit of fun.<eos> Why?
If you lay a hand on her again, I will have you castrated.<eos> Is that clear?<eos> As crystal.<eos> But I don't think that you will.<eos> Why not?
I know. I should've told you this morning when you asked.<eos> This morning?<eos> How about when you showed up as a med student?<eos> Or before we slept together, Or before I let you into my life?<eos> Unbelievable.
I think you're underestimating. The challenges here... Severely.<eos> You may be right.<eos> Um, in that case, I have a suggestion.<eos> How about we put the team through a dress rehearsal?<eos> A rehearsal?
Hey. Any progress?<eos> Definitely stressed out and anxious.<eos> Whether it rises to the level of a disorder, I don't know.<eos> She mentioned a potentially unhealthy association with food, But I'm just... I'm not getting.<eos> Me neither.
It is a possibility, but we are gonna do whatever we can to prevent that.<eos> And you want me to decide between my son and my sister's?<eos> But how?<eos> Our recommendation is to give the blood to your nephew, Josh.<eos> Josh?
Well, I'm just saying, if you are ...<eos> I mean, it's not my comfort zone, but I'm good.<eos> I'll just tell the truth.<eos> I'm good at that.<eos> You?
[ Indistinct conversations ] If he hasn't shown up by now, he's not going to.<eos> Trust me. I know him.<eos> He hates confrontation.<eos> We've got to give him a chance.<eos> Why?
So that's why you were so happy to see me.<eos> You and I, we must've, uh, you know...<eos> - Dated? - Sure.<eos> We'll go with that.<eos> Uh, no. Sorry.
Piper, are you up for manning the weapons?<eos> I'm offended you had to ask.<eos> - Is Mack okay? - He's alive, yes.<eos> What the hell happened? Why didn't you s...<eos> - Not now, YoYo!
That's too dangerous.<eos> Might give me enough Adrenaline to take on some terminators.<eos> I'll find a way to take them myself.<eos> I don't want any - more bad to happen to you.<eos> - Me?
- Is he working out so far?<eos> - So far. So I'm introducing Megan to...<eos> Adam, Linda.<eos> Anybody else?<eos> Russell.
I don't understand.<eos> Why are you so concerned about my health all of a sudden?<eos> I can see that you're sleep deprived and malnourished.<eos> It's my job to offer care and comfort to anyone who needs it.<eos> Anyone?
I'll let her know.<eos> Since when do you want to see my family?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's been a while. It might do you some good.<eos> - Me?
Since when do you want to see my family?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's been a while. It might do you some good.<eos> - Me?<eos> - And me.
I don't know.<eos> It's been a while. It might do you some good.<eos> - Me?<eos> - And me.<eos> Us.
- We can't go home to Abby like this.<eos> Don't we have old clothes in some of those boxes?<eos> - How was your day?<eos> - Good.<eos> Yours?
- Something came up.<eos> He asked me if I could do it.<eos> I... i wanted to get<eos> - your permission first.<eos> - No. - Why not?
It... terrifies me.<eos> The lecture you gave left quite an indelible impression.<eos> Heroin is wonderful, but too much can be deadly, as I'm sure you know.<eos> His eyes will roll back and he'll just stop breathing.<eos> Painless.
Come on.<eos> Jesus, Amani, get it together.<eos> We look like a bunch of greenbacks.<eos> Or worse... narcs.<eos> Unbelievable.
If I have more questions, I know where to find you.<eos> War wound.<eos> The injury was handled well.<eos> - Corporate clinic do that?<eos> - Military hospital.
Unaware they're about to go extinct.<eos> "Ten ways to tell how he feels about you."<eos> "Number one,"<eos> "he brings you small gifts."<eos> Check.
We're here. We need a plan.<eos> We give him what he wants.<eos> We give up?<eos> That's your plan?<eos> No, not Frost. Arthur.
How is the boy wonder?<eos> Is he still breathing?<eos> That's sort of why I'm here.<eos> I... want to help you.<eos> And him.
But you know what, it doesn't matter, because they took him.<eos> Black Badge.<eos> Said they're taking him to prison.<eos> Shit.<eos> Why?
- Deputy Marshall?<eos> - Yeah, he's been demoted.<eos> You came alone?<eos> Curious.<eos> Foolish.
Two murders wiped off the boards!<eos> One mystery remains, though.<eos> Why are you dressed like a pirate?<eos> When I'm done, I'll buy you a drink, yeah?<eos> Not you, though.
He knows how I feel about the fucking mermaid!<eos> And when our girl rises up from the sea, it'll be on her God-given talents, not some magical sea witch's spell.<eos> And she'll know better than to marry outside her race.<eos> All right, come on. Let's go.<eos> Uh, Sahar?
Yay, me! Yay!<eos> Yeah! It's a little... It's a little cheesy... but there's something really satisfying about it.<eos> See, for me it's, like, a little hacky.<eos> Um, but didn't you think it was satisfying, like... like a little bit?<eos> For me?
Why you think they call it "Black Friday"?<eos> I say we tell 'em we ain't lettin' no one else in this prison until Bayley is in chains.<eos> That's our demand.<eos> - I'm cool with that.<eos> - Me, too.
So stupid.<eos> Bitches, man.<eos> Get out!<eos> Dumb-ass white bitches!<eos> Stupid.
Anyone can go to a print shop and have cards made that say anything they like.<eos> Well, you're just a heap of facts, aren't you, Klaus?<eos> Facts and facts and facts and facts!<eos> But none of them do you any good.<eos> Just like poor Uncle Monty.
You're gonna get us all home!<eos> I can't.<eos> I don't have my powers on this planet.<eos> But I will help you.<eos> All of you.
I'm sure she doesn't really hate Valentine's Day.<eos> She called it a manufactured holiday for patsies.<eos> Okay... Okay, so the trimmings aren't her style, but you can celebrate your own way. What kind of stuff does she like?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Guns?
Ms. Grant, this could be dangerous.<eos> No. No, no. This will be dangerous.<eos> But if it's dangerous for all of you, why shouldn't it be dangerous for me?<eos> But I'll need Winslow.<eos> Me?
He is the love of your life.<eos> You're talking in the present tense?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - What Kyle and I had... - Okay, I think I'm good.<eos> - You?
I wanna know how you got it in there, past the security cameras.<eos> How did you get the codes?<eos> How did you get the security codes?<eos> I wanna know who you sold the original to.<eos> What shady dealer in what shady country.
Aren't you excited to see what Constantine left you?<eos> Oui, Madame.<eos> Can you handle two?<eos> Two?<eos> Two Madame Clios.
There's five more million under the bed at that motel in a couple of duffel bags and a suitcase.<eos> You guys need to know how big this mistake you're making is.<eos> You have $8 million of some drug kingpin's money?<eos> - That's right.<eos> - Why?
He's aiding and abetting the sale of drugs.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - Oh, boy.<eos> Who knows how much pain and misery he's caused?<eos> - Would cause. - Would cause.<eos> To kids, even.
How are we gonna do this?<eos> Byrde liquidates his business.<eos> Somebody does the same to Bruce.<eos> He jerks his family from Chicago and $8 million from the bank, transporting both to southern Missouri.<eos> Why?
He did that shit.<eos> He guilty as fuck.<eos> I knew it.<eos> But you should still go see him.<eos> Why?
Pods!<eos> What is it?<eos> What's happening?<eos> We can't blow up the city!<eos> - Why?
Your son's been lying for you.<eos> You can't leave him like that, Alan, knowing you killed the lad he loved.<eos> You need to tell the truth, Alan.<eos> Not to me.<eos> To your boy.
Is s... Is someone in there?<eos> I wish you'd told me how you felt sooner, Eugene.<eos> I kind of already promised myself to someone else.<eos> What?<eos> Who?
[chuckles] Looks like the spam escaped your socks.<eos> [inmates hooting and yelling]<eos> Well, that does not seem very PC.<eos> Or is it allowed if you're darker than a Band-Aid?<eos> [grunts and sighs]
We're not gonna jump to conclusions. [stutters] I'd rather it be a riot than a shooter any day.<eos> Inmates can't organize. And lady inmates? Come on.<eos> I give 'em 15, 20 minutes before they're all pulling each other's hair and begging us to come back inside. - Ma'am.<eos> - Mmm-hmm. [in Spanish] You think they care about us?<eos> [inmates] No!
We got a lifetime of regrets to keep us company.<eos> - How was your day?<eos> - Fantastic.<eos> I discovered a whole new muscle in my back I hadn't pulled yet.<eos> You?
And... and it used to, before, you could... you could find somebody to talk to if you wanted, you know? Or... or cookie's up their sleeve, and...<eos> Now it's, "Fuck you, inmate.<eos> I'mma fuckin' ruin your life just because I can."<eos> It's like human niceness has just gone renegade, and I don't think it's coming back anytime soon.<eos> -I'm sorry.
Now it's, "Fuck you, inmate.<eos> I'mma fuckin' ruin your life just because I can."<eos> It's like human niceness has just gone renegade, and I don't think it's coming back anytime soon.<eos> -I'm sorry.<eos> -Yeah, me too.
Aw, well, thank you.<eos> - Now, what is your name?<eos> - Kasey.<eos> Well, Kasey, it is very, very nice to meet you.<eos> Likewise.
Without disappointment, she and I have nothing.<eos> One less Pabst.<eos> Mark it, Norma.<eos> You could ask for help.<eos> Why?
Is that it?<eos> With what... you want me to beat you?<eos> Press charges?<eos> Send you to prison?<eos> Why?
Or we can just find it.<eos> Where do I start?<eos> Whoever did this got in and out of the tower without being seen.<eos> In order to risk that, she'd have to care more about the flame than her own life.<eos> - "She"?
And if we all work together the way they have, then I promise, we will truly make this the first of many, many new days for the greatest country in the world.<eos> Good morning, America.<eos> God bless America, and thank you.<eos> And we're out.<eos> Okay, guys.
It's an honor to meet you.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Hard sell. But I'm gonna have to go with the dynasty.<eos> You're out.<eos> Why?
What did you agree to do?<eos> Interesting dining utensil.<eos> Smooth plant, sweetheart.<eos> The Mafia isn't your target.<eos> - Gold star, Detective.
Give me a name.<eos> I'll give you a name.<eos> Harlee Santos.<eos> Witness for the prosecution, appearing in court tomorrow to perjure herself in a mob case...<eos> - thanks to you.
The night that you first told me that there was a rat in the crew.<eos> Harlee, I swear to God, if I hear something else,<eos> - I'm gonna... - No, that's it. That's it.<eos> I'm gonna leave a message for Linklater.<eos> Myself.
Remodeling or is someone starting a drum circle?<eos> No, it's a mouthy dealer, our LT's just playing bad cop.<eos> Anything that will make my job harder?<eos> Last thing I want is you doing any more overtime.<eos> Bad luck.
The price of peace.<eos> He gets Rossi. We get an end to this.<eos> Okay, then make the offer yourself.<eos> We just did.<eos> No, not to me, to him.
Move your car.<eos> You let a little kid steal your knight?<eos> Before I even knew what was happening.<eos> - Kid showed no mercy.<eos> - None, none whatsoever.
Why don't you go over there and get some rest?<eos> Matt, I know you have been up for three days.<eos> Why don't you go lie down before you fall down?<eos> I've been writing this kid rain checks and IOUs<eos> his whole life.
In theory.<eos> Follow me.<eos> - What are we doing?<eos> - Deposit this.<eos> - What? Why?
- Deposit this.<eos> - What? Why?<eos> - Just do it.<eos> - Okay. Good.<eos> - Good what?
Somebody call my lawyer right fucking now.<eos> Hey, what happened?<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> I'm in here with the safe, but I can't get it open.<eos> Why not?
Thank you.<eos> Sure.<eos> - Just follow me. I'm Wendy, by the way.<eos> - Nice to meet you.<eos> Thanks.
He'll turn easy.<eos> - I'll scare him.<eos> - And Byrde?<eos> Once we get Ruth, the niece.<eos> What about her?
I'm in Chicago, for fuck's sake.<eos> There is so much more I could be doing.<eos> - Well, then transfer.<eos> - It's not that easy.<eos> Why not?
- That's what I told him.<eos> You can keep it from her, but eventually she's gonna notice the extra zeros in the bank account.<eos> All right?<eos> Bloody Mary bar.<eos> Sweet.
And you intend to collect insurance on this property? so I doubt it's even gonna cover the cost to clear the site.<eos> anyway.<eos> it'll take a while.<eos> I've got a... I got a crew coming in to haul all this stuff away this afternoon.<eos> sorry.
Have a Superstore day.<eos> $67.93.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> - We can't talk in there.<eos> - Why the hell not?
Well, that's what happens if you drink for three days straight.<eos> I told everyone you were at Esalen meditating.<eos> Go shower, and meet us at the Hayworth.<eos> Wait.<eos> Why?
We getting close, Dr. Griffin?<eos> It's just through there.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Luna, I'm sorry about Nyko.<eos> Me, too.
Maybe it'll help.<eos> You know when you're holding your breath and there's that... unbearable feeling right before you relent and take a gulp of air?<eos> Well, imagine that feeling lasting for a week.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Yeah, well, me, too.
- Because I may not give a shit about Fillory. But I do, as its royal ambassador, have access to its guards and its dungeons.<eos> And I'll use a to throw you in b, but help me, and I'll let you go free.<eos> - I don't believe you.<eos> Your loyalty will always lie with...<eos> - with me.
I don't think I've said that out loud before.<eos> Does it sound silly?<eos> No.<eos> Following Axelrod's a nonstarter.<eos> Why?
- The usual stuff...<eos> - good for people, communities.<eos> - Got it.<eos> And when it's done, you give it to Bill to read to the world.<eos> Gates or Clinton?
Scotland, with two cars that are credible, relevant, important, work and are real.<eos> They were still shouting at me as I arrived with all of the film crews at our track.<eos> Itch, that you've managed to scratch over the last ten years.<eos> I don't know how.<eos> Why...
Don't scoff.<eos> This is a system that is cheap, works anywhere in the world, and you can fit it to any car, no matter how old it is.<eos> Let me show you how it works, ok?<eos> Step in.<eos> Ready?
- Yeah? Why isn't she waking up?<eos> Fight probably triggered sleep mode.<eos> It's like a hackmod kill switch.<eos> We all have one.<eos> Why?
Oops.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> - I can't. - Shh.<eos> - Let them finish.<eos> - Why?
If he could move, Benji, he wouldn't hesitate to kill you.<eos> Come on.<eos> Don't be a pussy, Benj.<eos> You got this, Pukes.<eos> So, so, so sorry.
All right, so what'd he say?<eos> What kind of problem have they run up against?<eos> He was rushed and didn't elaborate.<eos> Simply said that they're in danger and need safe transport off the station.<eos> Android...
It's not a criticism.<eos> I kinda like it.<eos> Even if we find a compatible airlock for the Marauder to dock, how do we get the inner doors open?<eos> Trust me, kid, that's the easy part.<eos> Emperor.
Just admit it, you're winging it on this one.<eos> It's not a criticism.<eos> Kinda like it. But even if we find a compatible airlock for the Marauder to dock, how do we get the inner doors open?<eos> Trust me, kid, that's the easy part.<eos> Emperor.
And you will, by staying here and keeping an eye on things.<eos> Make sure nobody does anything stupid.<eos> Warn us if they try.<eos> I'll stay here and back up the kid.<eos> The kid?
Make sure nobody does anything stupid.<eos> Warn us if they try.<eos> I'll stay here and back up the kid.<eos> The kid?<eos> Y-younger person.
Beauties.<eos> What do you say we find ourselves a nice fat, juicy target and see what these babies can do?<eos> No. Priority number one is finding a buyer.<eos> We'll keep one crate and sell the rest.<eos> - To who?
They move against us, and they run the risk of Ferrous Corp finding out they've been smuggling missiles to Traugott.<eos> Oh, well, okay. But you should have dialed me in.<eos> You mean Tabor, don't you?<eos> Sure.<eos> Tabor and me.
You ok with all this?<eos> They're just blowing off steam.<eos> Blowing off steam?<eos> Is that what we were doing when we strung up Murphy for killing Wells?<eos> - Pour. - Mm-hmm.
Why are you doing this?<eos> I already told you. I know the players, their strengths, their weak...<eos> You backed me over Quinn.<eos> But you never asked for anything. Not even the regency.<eos> Why?
Kerry.<eos> Kerry!<eos> - Please.<eos> - How could you do this to me?<eos> - To you?
You mean the reimbursement we're collecting tonight?<eos> That's what I hoped to speak to you about.<eos> - We'll leave you to your business.<eos> - Our business.<eos> Our business, captain.
Maybe you want to help us out now?<eos> Let's go!<eos> Load 'em up!<eos> - How did it go?<eos> - Not so good.
Man, I just used the damn card.<eos> Well, hold-hold on, man, what you doing?<eos> Yo, it's a mistake.<eos> Yo, that's my card, man!<eos> Sorry, man.
Something doesn't feel right about this.<eos> This place.<eos> Well, the map was pretty clear. They were looking at south Ashland.<eos> I know, it's just... If I was gonna rob an armored truck, I wouldn't do it here. What?<eos> Why, exactly?
Hey, we're not giving up.<eos> But for now...<eos> You did what you could.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Unbelievable.
I am... apprehensive.<eos> Aethelflaed is a sweet girl.<eos> She is.<eos> You are fond of her suitor, Lord?<eos> Aethelred.
What's in the safe room is our business, not your's.<eos> What are you trying to hide?<eos> Ever wonder why Dad never gave you the code?<eos> He made me promise not to give it to anyone, especially not... to...<eos> the goldigger especially not to you.
But I earned my title fairly by being tougher and hungrier than anybody else.<eos> You know, I quite liked your husband actually.<eos> He was a cold-hearted bastard, but we understood each other.<eos> That doesn't surprise me in the least.<eos> Baron.
You were expecting someone else?<eos> - I... - I won't take it personally.<eos> You had a rough couple days.<eos> We were both relieved when your fever finally broke last night.<eos> - Both?
Maryanne?<eos> Maryanne.<eos> Put those things down at once!<eos> I'm done taking orders from you, baroness.<eos> Baroness.
We need to get word out to the widow.<eos> But we can't tip our hand.<eos> It'll have to come from a source she'll believe.<eos> What do you propose?<eos> Baron?
Hannah Wells?<eos> That's who they have in custody?<eos> Find out what she knows.<eos> And if the president wants answers, I'll give them to one person...<eos> The president himself.
I'm sorry I doubted you.<eos> It's not just the bureau. The whole country owes you a great debt.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> Unfortunately, this isn't enough.<eos> What? Why?
And he said he'd get back to you when he can.<eos> Not good enough.<eos> The president just changed his plans, ma'am.<eos> He's getting out of the hospital tonight.<eos> - Tonight? Why?
It was a cluster of epic proportions.<eos> Was the shooter a lone wolf, part of a group?<eos> We'll never know now.<eos> But there was Vice President MacLeish this morning turning it into a victory lap.<eos> - Why?
Fine.<eos> I'll see you in committee.<eos> We had the shooter contained.<eos> FBI was ready to apprehend, but MacLeish overruled them.<eos> Why?
Show him. He's not the only alpha dog in Congress.<eos> Senator Hunter, thank you very much for coming.<eos> I believe you know my Chief of Staff, Emily Rhodes.<eos> Nice to see you again, Senator.<eos> - Likewise.
I was appointed by a Republican governor, and I can't go rogue on the first big vote of my term.<eos> Walter, we've got a chance to do something really good here.<eos> This bill is gonna save lives.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Me, too.
Did you know she'd be the first girl vice president?<eos> Yeah, I did.<eos> You think that's cool?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Me too.
Come on in, Abe.<eos> You know my new strategist...<eos> Aaron Shore. - Abe Leonard.<eos> It's a pleasure.<eos> - Pleasure's mine, Mr. Shore.
He may have sent me a photo.<eos> We are no longer friends.<eos> Fernandez?<eos> Agent Foerstel. Nice to meet you.<eos> Status update.
Hey, hey. We got, we got you, we got you.<eos> She's out!<eos> Thank God.<eos> And me.<eos> And-and God.
Broken, nowhere to go, no direction.<eos> Zeke gave you a purpose.<eos> And, Viv, turning tricks for cash.<eos> Now you don't have to.<eos> All 'cause of Zeke.
- We sell canned foods, so...<eos> Anything canned under the sun.<eos> That was almost the Howard Foods slogan.<eos> My idea. I liked it.<eos> Mother, not so much.
Wait.<eos> We're actually married.<eos> So said the judge.<eos> - That makes me so happy.<eos> - Me, too.
All right.<eos> Yeah, see you there.<eos> He's gonna meet us at Torino diner tomorrow at 6:00.<eos> We should let the lawyer know.<eos> Hey, big guy.
- That doesn't seem right.<eos> - I didn't want to push back.<eos> Stress out Gabby even more than she already is.<eos> This has been rough on her, man.<eos> And on you.
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> You okay?<eos> You?
That thing is still inside of you.<eos> This'll be our little secret, okay?<eos> I guess that makes us even, Rosie.<eos> To them things... we must be as bad as Bonnie and Clyde.<eos> Hey, Rosie?
There's seven billion people on this Earth.<eos> How many others like him?<eos> How many more monsters?<eos> You should thank me.<eos> Me and all the travelers like me.
No, baby, we gotta get off the grid.<eos> Wyoming, Montana, some place we can be isolated.<eos> Just you, me, and your mommy.<eos> And no one around us will get hurt.<eos> Like Uncle Mark.
Yeah, about that. Being your lab rat doesn't sound like that good of an idea to me anymore.<eos> We had a deal.<eos> What if there was someone even purer than me?<eos> Someone who didn't travel to this world like the rest of us. Because they didn't need to.<eos> And why not?
But did you really think we'd use the same word on your bratty brother that we used on the mill workeroaa?<eos> You will never find the word to save your brother.<eos> And you certainly won't find it in time to save Charles.<eos> Help me! Help me!<eos> Sorry, Charlie.
The DJ stand's back there, so he probably hung out with her more than anyone.<eos> Trish says we're out of Sambuca, she went out for more.<eos> I'll question Nels.<eos> Wish me luck.<eos> Why?
Do you have it with you?<eos> I... I did.<eos> But I didn't tell you.<eos> I...<eos> To whom?
It's gonna be all right, Jasper.<eos> Okay.<eos> You're right over here.<eos> Can I go home now?<eos> Yeah, of course.
The flame could kill you.<eos> I have no choice.<eos> Tell them, healer.<eos> Go on, tell them all how it is your daughter became a natblida.<eos> Through science.
I will go to a hotel.<eos> Just go to a store.<eos> He looks miserable and he's scared to death for you, and I don't want to lie to your husband anymore, so can I just tell him something, please?<eos> - No.<eos> - Wh...
He wouldn't say.<eos> "Why" what? What's up with Karev?<eos> He's not in jail. There's no trial.<eos> - Yeah, Andrew dropped all the charges.<eos> - Really? Why?
Dr. Grey found my cancer.<eos> She told me about it. She held my hand while I bawled about it.<eos> She told me how she was gonna take it out.<eos> I've been going to the same hairstylist for 23 years.<eos> Why?
What's your name again?<eos> Hemostasis was established, and the patient was sent to post-op without complications.<eos> Dr. Webber?<eos> May I, uh... may I run something by you?<eos> By me?
It's at the house in my jewelry bag, and I want you to have it.<eos> - Mom.<eos> - Your father gave it to me.<eos> He'd want you to have it, too.<eos> So, please.
And try wearing a little lipstick.<eos> You know, Mom, if you keep going at this rate, you're gonna run out of advice before tomorrow.<eos> Phew, this polish smells.<eos> Want me to open a window?<eos> Oh.
I have to think about it.<eos> It's supposed to hit the power grid tonight?<eos> Yes, around 7:00.<eos> Okay. Tell her I'll get back to her.<eos> "Her"?
No, this is serious.<eos> I mean, my God, what happened?<eos> - You were carjacked?<eos> - No.<eos> Somebody else.
I, um, why?<eos> I wasn't told all the whys and wherefores, but it seemed very important.<eos> One second.<eos> What do you need?<eos> You.
That helps us with COPA, too.<eos> They want to kick Theroux off the force.<eos> We just... We haven't given 'em enough of a reason to do it. Then we're stuck.<eos> Diane?<eos> You happy here?
Also, it'll free you up for our lawsuit against Cook County.<eos> Theroux's been kicked off the force, but we've got a six million dollar civil suit in the works.<eos> No, I'm not doing that.<eos> Yes, you are. No.<eos> Sorry.
Don't go anywhere. I'll be right back.<eos> So, when were you planning on telling me? Where the bloody hell is he?<eos> ! Zelena!<eos> You can't see him yet.<eos> Why?
Oh, I don't know. She gets tea from a lot of different places.<eos> That's okay. I can just ask her tomorrow morning, before I go.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Have a good night.<eos> - You too.
I figured out how to turn it on, but the screen just shows a cartoon turtle sobbing.<eos> Perhaps it's a paper jam.<eos> And what about when the little sushi roll comes out and cuts the turtle's head off?<eos> - Toner issue.<eos> - Why?
Right, but maybe you should speak to my colleague first.<eos> Hi.<eos> I got hit by a bus.<eos> Wow. This place looks amazing.<eos> Yes, thanks to Gina.
- What? - Ignore it.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - I don't believe you.<eos> - Well, believe whatever you have to believe to get out of here.<eos> Why?
Why do we have to ignore it?<eos> Okay? I-In Seattle, sure, but Pierce isn't here.<eos> No one is.<eos> That doesn't matter.<eos> Why?
- No one knew about him.<eos> - No one knew about me.<eos> I ran for Mayor of Newark on a platform of free 40s and weed for all my niggas.<eos> And I won in a landslide. It was crazy.<eos> Crazy landslide.
How can we possibly win?<eos> This blade... it's called Hrunting.<eos> It was enchanted with light magic to ensure that whoever carries it into battle will be hailed a hero.<eos> So, you can either be remembered as a hero or forever known as the coward who ran on the eve of victory.<eos> All right, Beowulf.
This is what I'm talking about.<eos> Come along, Tessa.<eos> Your mother needs her privacy.<eos> You need to go to Mexico.<eos> - Why?
Good.<eos> Maybe you're simply done.<eos> Now's your chance.<eos> Walk away.<eos> Why?
Yeah, I mean obviously my...<eos> That's the dopest thing I've ever seen!<eos> Is that even a trick?<eos> Yeah, I doubt the bird liked it.<eos> What bird?
These things happen.<eos> Thank you.<eos> If you're a moron!<eos> You slander me?<eos> Me? !
We don't really know.<eos> Well, what's the mission?<eos> It's about making the world a better place.<eos> You and Mr. Crane are what's known as Witnesses.<eos> Witnesses.
LAPD.<eos> We're here to speak to an "Owlsy..."<eos> Why are you having so much trouble with that?<eos> "Owsy."<eos> Owlsly.
We're here to speak to an "Owlsy..."<eos> Why are you having so much trouble with that?<eos> "Owsy."<eos> Owlsly.<eos> Owlsly.
1965 was a bust.<eos> - Oh, sorry, buddy.<eos> - It's all right, rip said he dropped my grandfather off in 1965 New York and told him to assume a new identity.<eos> - Well, he'd need to find work.<eos> - Why?
I'm sorry, Nathaniel.<eos> This is all my fault.<eos> But once this is over, I'm getting captain hunter to take me back to 1956, to the day i abandoned bettie and Hank.<eos> - Wait, I was--i was just talking hypothetically.<eos> - Why?
I just need to make a few adjustments to the core.<eos> Did you already turn it on?<eos> I-I had specific instructions from Mr. Thawne to do so.<eos> Grey, we need to talk.<eos> Grey?
Oh, this? Yeah, it is.<eos> Turns out they, uh, they charge for new knees.<eos> I feel so bad.<eos> I should pay that.<eos> - What? Why?
Come on, what did she advise?<eos> - She advised that I sue!<eos> - I knew it!<eos> Who? You.<eos> Me?
I was a pariah.<eos> So you got revenge.<eos> No, I didn't kill him.<eos> - Makes no difference to me.<eos> - Why?
Hey. Here you go.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Sophie Hausen murdered Travis Carter.<eos> I'm sure of it.<eos> Why?
- Where'd you get it?<eos> - Does it matter?<eos> I just want to know where I can get one, so I can look like a total fucking douchebag.<eos> Wow, right?<eos> Unbelievable.
More importantly, I could get all my money back, maybe even more.<eos> We could 10X this motherfucker, gents.<eos> - Although... - Although what?<eos> Well, I'm sorry to play the Cassandra again, but Dinesh can't sell Gavin the company.<eos> - Why not?
We could 10X this motherfucker, gents.<eos> - Although... - Although what?<eos> Well, I'm sorry to play the Cassandra again, but Dinesh can't sell Gavin the company.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - Why the fuck not?
Fine, but if you're not - _ - feeling better after the test, I'm taking you to the doctor, end of story.<eos> Got it.<eos> No way.<eos> Where did you find this?<eos> EBay.
Now tell me, what happened to the crew of this station.<eos> 'Hang on, you're in the repair bay, right?<eos> Get out of there!<eos> '<eos> - Why?
Specifically what kind of DNA?<eos> Would that be sweat?<eos> Saliva?<eos> It's semen.<eos> Semen?
I gave you a syringe a few weeks back.<eos> It's the last one, and we need it for Liv.<eos> Do you have it with you?<eos> I gave it to someone.<eos> To whom?
I want you to be happy again.<eos> But I don't believe killing Snow White will do that.<eos> Maybe by my helping you, you'll be able to move on so you can.<eos> How can you help me?<eos> With this.
I know, but it's interesting, right?<eos> I mean, who knows what goes on with the good pastor? What about Kansas?<eos> It was fine.<eos> I don't want to talk about it.<eos> Why?
We checked.<eos> But you're right.<eos> There are risks.<eos> There are real, long-term things we can offer you.<eos> And your son, too.
You're friends?<eos> No.<eos> Has Volodya introduced you to people?<eos> A few.<eos> Men.
So... are you allowed to trust anybody?<eos> Some people trust their wives.<eos> I didn't trust mine.<eos> I have no idea why.<eos> Well, what about your kids?
Well, Saturday is her sister's wedding.<eos> And then Sunday... you know, Sundays are just for me, you guys know that.<eos> Wait. Her sister's wedding?<eos> - That's what you should be afraid of.<eos> - Why?
Yes, because of the technology and because of our business proposal.<eos> Look, can you just please, for once, keep your dick out of the equation?<eos> I really wish I could, but my dick is the abacus upon which this equation will be...<eos> This is our CTO.<eos> Oh great.
- Not your fault.<eos> - Also... and I know this might piss you off to some degree,<eos> I have decided to make a deal with Keenan Feldspar.<eos> What?<eos> Why?
Oh. Stairs guy.<eos> Uh, that's quite a booth you got there.<eos> Oh, yes, thank you.<eos> We really think our company's message is worth getting out there.<eos> Yeah, us too. Us too.
You haven't eaten in, um...<eos> Mayakovsky said to start with really bland food, so I thought oatmeal.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Why bland food?<eos> - Or why...
To hell with this.<eos> Sebastian! No! No, no, no!<eos> No, no.<eos> They kicked you out?<eos> Yeah, thanks to you.
Mr. Driver, are you hurt? Mr. Driver?<eos> Annie?<eos> It's paint.<eos> What's that?<eos> Annie?
Showing images, things you want that you shouldn't.<eos> Then putting you through pain.<eos> Conversion therapy.<eos> We should check the fence for DNA.<eos> Annie?
No, I'm gonna stay.<eos> There's nothing there for me anymore anyway.<eos> Hey, Pride, maybe you need a good bartender.<eos> I'm kind of a vet now, right?<eos> Uh... sorry.
I mean, hello.<eos> This is Chad, husband of Courtney.<eos> You bring the cheese, we'll work it out.<eos> I'll text a time and place.<eos> Gott sie dank!
Circulate her bio-data in UP and Rajasthan... and she will immediately get married.<eos> It's not that easy, Badri. Kritika has already rejected 30 proposals.<eos> Then tell your sister... to stop trying to make a 'world record' for most number of rejections.<eos> Marry her...<eos> Vaidehi...
Thank you for keeping your promise.<eos> Looking nice.<eos> Carefully.<eos> Let me help.<eos> Alok...
I...<eos> Somdev!<eos> Somdev!<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Vaidehi call..
Where are you going?<eos> Vaidehi call..<eos> Passport...<eos> Airhostess...<eos> Vaidehi...
I am a master of English.<eos> I see...<eos> Then tell me the spelling of Vaidehi.<eos> Right away...<eos> Vaidehi...
Self-centered bitch.<eos> We were so stupid to love you.<eos> - Jules...<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - For what?
And, um, also that you probably shouldn't be right now.<eos> Why do you care?<eos> I... just do.<eos> Come with me... and help me try to convince Ember to let us keep Fillory.<eos> - Why?
Look, she's goin' through a really hard time.<eos> Yeah, she ain't the only one.<eos> I told Abby about everything.<eos> Now she's not talkin' to me.<eos> Well...
Well, I could... I could put in a word for you at the Cracker Barrel.<eos> Okay.<eos> What the fuck does that mean?<eos> I'm not gonna work at the Cracker Barrel.<eos> Oh, why?
Now he's got a big house in Aspen and a 25-year-old Russian bride.<eos> So what the fuck do I know?<eos> You guys like your salad dressing mixed in or on the side?<eos> - Don't matter to me.<eos> - Me either.
I mean, reading' Goodnight Moon? More like readin' Government Conspiracy Theory Shot on a Soundstage.<eos> Well, looks like I'm gonna be around, for a while anyway.<eos> The offer for the bar fell through.<eos> Shit. You want me to kick his ass?<eos> Whose?
I think you forgot something. What's that?<eos> The film, just hand it over.<eos> Well, if it isn't your mother's locker, then it's probably not her film.<eos> Yeah, so sorry.<eos> Really, really sorry.
Come on.<eos> There.<eos> There!<eos> Got it!<eos> Unbelievable.
Should make uploading faster.<eos> That's a great idea, actually, but it's still gonna take forever.<eos> Well, call in some Reeves techs to help him.<eos> Help who?<eos> Dameon.
- True.<eos> - I'm... I'm sorry. One more time.<eos> - What?<eos> We didn't behave well when we were married, and I feel bad about that.<eos> Me, too.
I didn't say you should be happy about it.<eos> We could contact Snyder.<eos> What?<eos> What are you gonna offer him, Will?<eos> Me?
- Uh...<eos> - I hope there's not a short.<eos> I think I heard it move over there.<eos> I know my pulse is racing. But I'm in no danger.<eos> None.
- Not yet.<eos> The contract is everything.<eos> We need total concentration for it.<eos> You know it's taken a lot of work to get here.<eos> Especially by you.
I suppose I just did.<eos> Mnemonics is spelled with an M.<eos> Not that you need my help or anything.<eos> Have a good weekend. [chuckling]<eos> You, too.
We have ever so many to choose from.<eos> We make all the latest fashions just as if they're straight from Paris.<eos> [stammering]<eos> Matthew Cuthbert, as I live and breathe.<eos> Uh, Jeannie?
- That is none of your concern.<eos> Now hurry along.<eos> Scat!<eos> Why does everything happen to me?<eos> Gilbert? !
Mrs. Barry paid a call today, and she hopes you'll forgive her and be good friends with Diana again.<eos> [squealing] Oh, I'll wash it later!<eos> I can't tie myself down to anything so unromantic as dishes at this thrilling moment!<eos> Anne, take a coat!<eos> Gilbert?
[squealing] Oh, I'll wash it later!<eos> I can't tie myself down to anything so unromantic as dishes at this thrilling moment!<eos> Anne, take a coat!<eos> Gilbert?<eos> [clanging]
I can't tie myself down to anything so unromantic as dishes at this thrilling moment!<eos> Anne, take a coat!<eos> Gilbert?<eos> [clanging]<eos> Gilbert!
Anne, take a coat!<eos> Gilbert?<eos> [clanging]<eos> Gilbert!<eos> Gilbert!
Marilla?<eos> Are you all right, dear?<eos> I'm sorry, what?<eos> Oh, no, thank you. I-I'm fine.<eos> Gilbert!
Need my help with anything? Anything I can do?<eos> Just take care of yourself.<eos> And come home someday.<eos> Hope everything works out.<eos> For you, too.
We've been together all these years, thick or thin, so don't think I'll put up with you slipping away now.<eos> Anne will be home today, and she'll be very happy to see you.<eos> Hello?<eos> Matthew...<eos> Jeannie.
Hello?<eos> Matthew...<eos> Jeannie.<eos> Matthew!<eos> Jeannie!
- Right, I'm going.<eos> Well, what about us?<eos> I don't know, you'll have to have a threehander or something. - Aw...<eos> Threehanders are shite.<eos> Sorry about that.
Now, a labor dispute, it's just like a flat tire;<eos> It's not an emergency. Brah, I haven't sold a single shrimp all morning.<eos> You got to throw them all in Halawa or they gonna kill my business.<eos> Can't do that.<eos> Why not?
I thought this was a school, not a prison, sir.<eos> We have rules.<eos> Where were you sneaking off to?<eos> I need to check on my sister.<eos> - Why?
Or I won't contact your family and tell them what you've done, that you keep your sister prisoner, you've committed murder?<eos> Why do you lock up your sister?<eos> To protect her.<eos> From what?<eos> From it all.
Okay, let's go again.<eos> No.<eos> You better practice with Ezra first.<eos> - All right.<eos> - Why?
Earth to Pete!<eos> I need you to get every bit of jamming equipment we have into the van right now.<eos> Reyes, Cobb, switch your guns to Taser.<eos> Aim for the propellers!<eos> Sure, Detective.
We're gonna be on Good Morning, America when we're famous.<eos> Tell me about the contest.<eos> Forget about the contest, Simone.<eos> It's over.<eos> Why?
I see you with a more agreeable<eos> Asian-type girl.<eos> Star ain't here.<eos> They at the hospital with her sister.<eos> Which hospital?
- Not the right kind.<eos> Do you want to be known as some football player's piece of ass?<eos> Our likes are sky-high, and we're trending off the charts.<eos> No.<eos> You.
Why you gotta make this so damn difficult?<eos> Because you won't tell me the real reason you just made that switch.<eos> You want your place back up front,<eos> - stay the hell away from Hunter.<eos> - Why?
Um... ¿Star aquí?<eos> Oh, Star is definitely not aquí.<eos> She went off with her dumbass baller that she keeps on a very short leash.<eos> I think he has her on the leash.<eos> Leash?
So?<eos> How's Hunter?<eos> Actually, I've been meaning to talk to you about him.<eos> He bought us a house.<eos> "Us"?
Actually, I've been meaning to talk to you about him.<eos> He bought us a house.<eos> "Us"?<eos> Who's "us"?<eos> Me and him.
Sources claim the outbreak can be traced to a commercial airline flight from Paris earlier this year.<eos> You better believe that right after roll call tomorrow I'm getting to one of those locations.<eos> Peyton says those vaccines are arriving tonight.<eos> They're keeping them at some city facility.<eos> Which one?
We pick a good one.<eos> Our usual Saturday.<eos> And what if she just walks out and slaughters everyone just for a laugh?<eos> Well, I will be monitoring you the whole time.<eos> Me?
- Sorry, mate.<eos> Really sorry.<eos> - Pain.<eos> Kill.<eos> Me.
- Pain.<eos> Kill.<eos> Me.<eos> Kill.<eos> Me.
Oh, shit.<eos> Well...<eos> Alanis Morissette.<eos> - Alice loved that cat.<eos> - Okay, but why...
I know I've got a gun around here someplace.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Is tonight your wedding night?<eos> Why would you think that?<eos> No reason.
Okay, so what'd you want to talk about?<eos> Just don't tell Smurf about the bar, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> You know, I'm tired and drunk, and I'd kind of like to have sex.<eos> Me, too.
The hospital has cable, so...<eos> There you go.<eos> I just wanted to come by and let you know they're charging Benoit today.<eos> Yeah, he's going away for a very long time.<eos> - Thanks to you.
You have an apostle spirit.<eos> That's good, right?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> It means you're willing to serve Jesus no matter what's asked of you.<eos> Jesus?
Yeah.<eos> Did they hurt you?<eos> You're safe now. Okay?<eos> I gave them your number.<eos> Who?
Yeah. Okay, we'll do something together this week.<eos> Just you and me.<eos> How 'bout that?<eos> Why?<eos> Why?
From the BKA... they found it on one of the attackers.<eos> You were right about one thing, a bunch of terrorists looking to kill some Marines.<eos> - Not some Marines.<eos> - They were after us.<eos> Why?
Let's move.<eos> Nobody pantses America.<eos> I know a guy at the Department of Transportation.<eos> Ironically, he never goes anywhere.<eos> Good for him.
Archer.<eos> Delgado.<eos> Hill.<eos> Lupo.<eos> Morrone.
Stand in front of the camera and read it aloud.<eos> "My father, Magnus Steele, took $200 million" "from innocent, hard-working Americans."<eos> "Today that wrong will be righted."<eos> "He will return the money by 6:00 p.m. Eastern time." "Or my girlfriend and I will be executed."<eos> But why here?
I've known those kids since they were in preschool.<eos> I won't let anything happen to them, okay?<eos> We just need a new plan.<eos> We can't run, so we need to find a way to tell my team where we are.<eos> What team?
- Find Margot.<eos> Let her know wherever she is, she's in danger.<eos> Hello, Mum.<eos> We need to talk about the baby.<eos> The baby?
- Mark Usher's no one's friend.<eos> Francis Underwood hasn't won a thing, okay?<eos> And there's a good... more than a good chance that Will Conway will be the next President of the United States.<eos> Could you give me a moment? It's been a difficult few days.<eos> Better?
Hello, Cameron.<eos> Hello, Mitchell. Where's the rest of Britney Queers?<eos> It's the Britney Spares, Martin.<eos> The Britney Queers were eliminated weeks ago.<eos> Yes, by us.
Thank you, Doctor.<eos> I believe you gents owe me five cents each.<eos> We made a little wager as to who would find your cadaver first, Doctor.<eos> Good, you've embraced the first part of my training exercise with enthusiasm.<eos> Constables.
Get a judge's warrant.<eos> Sir, you likely met Minnie Hobbins, William's daughter.<eos> By all accounts she's a real chip off the old block.<eos> I anticipate no shortage of colour in their history, George.<eos> Indeed not, sir.
What are the reasons women reject Raj?<eos> Can we not play this game?<eos> Doesn't like games. That's one.<eos> Ignore him.<eos> Yeah, sorry about the breakup.
Her bike had gotten a flat tire.<eos> And she begged me not to tell.<eos> You didn't keep the secret.<eos> I told my best friend.<eos> Kenny.
- Morning, honey!<eos> - Go to hell!<eos> All right, you guys, podcast time.<eos> We got the equipment and the perfect business plan... give our show away for free, and tell no one how to find it.<eos> Ready?
I'm, I'm going to America's Cup.<eos> It's a sailing race. Yeah.<eos> Look, I leave in three days.<eos> - I'm gonna be gone for a couple months.<eos> Me, too.
- as long as there are no feelings.<eos> - Nope. None here.<eos> Nope. Not a one.<eos> I am so relieved.<eos> Me too.
It seems redundant, but they're all yours.<eos> Keep me apprised.<eos> - You okay?<eos> - Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> You?
The story is about Alice in the Palace and her caterpillar friend, Frosty.<eos> Frosty the Caterpillar?<eos> He's a wonderful caterpillar.<eos> He wants to change into a butterfly so the Princess will notice him.<eos> Why?
She got what she wanted.<eos> You should've let me give her a shoeing.<eos> You really think that would've helped?<eos> Wouldn't have hurt.<eos> Well, me.
Can you tell me what it was?<eos> How to win.<eos> I brought a peace offering.<eos> Coffee. I can't accept that.<eos> Why not?
We got all the Internet traffic for the entire city.<eos> Whoa, how did you--?<eos> Not me, your mayor.<eos> He took a break from bedding his employees to help us out.<eos> Thanks to your boss.
You got somewhere to be?<eos> I just don't have to listen to this.<eos> That's your right.<eos> You know, maybe I'll share it with your son.<eos> Yeah. Your son.
Whose answers to the questions you want to ask her could never be trusted.<eos> All that really matters is that you vanished off the face of the earth nearly 30 years ago, and yet here you are.<eos> Leave the past in the past, Tom.<eos> Nothing good will come from digging up secrets.<eos> Sorry, sport.
We don't have time for that.<eos> For all we know, Murphy's on his way back from Paris right now.<eos> If there is something incriminating in here, then he might come back and get it before we can get a warrant.<eos> Jesus, Keen, you just got your badge back.<eos> Because of Reddington.
Spend a little quality time with my lady friend.<eos> There'll be plenty of time for that later.<eos> Why don't you grab yourself a beer, check out the view. I'm gonna unpack real quick.<eos> If you insist.<eos> Why?
I'm trying to get home to my wife to give her the Valentine's Day she deserves.<eos> Would you stop playing and help me out, please?<eos> Her name is Vanessa.<eos> And regrettably, she's no longer in my employ.<eos> Why?
Of course.<eos> You okay?<eos> You don't look so good.<eos> I didn't get much sleep last night.<eos> Why?
Credit card, money, house gone.<eos> None of it works.<eos> Sabrina, Alba, Mickey...<eos> They're gone.<eos> Why?
Ben, this is all part of it.<eos> It's all right, Ben.<eos> I'm in control.<eos> Why aren't we moving?<eos> Sorry, sir.
You sold it?<eos> I checked my records after your call.<eos> Sold it a year and a half ago.<eos> To a Bill Johns?<eos> William Johns?
I don't believe it.<eos> Come on, little sweet thing. Look at you.<eos> Look at your little face.<eos> Marvin? Marvin, I got a present for ya.<eos> Rosie!
I'm afraid it's already too late.<eos> The poor thing.<eos> It must not have survived the fall.<eos> How did you do that?<eos> Magic.
Retired.<eos> You gave me quite a scare.<eos> That's some grip.<eos> Oh, please.<eos> Me?
Thank God.<eos> Careful, he's bored.<eos> You know that was fun.<eos> What if I said that you could help put the most powerful. New York real estate developer in jail?<eos> Andrew Withrow.
Because I've disabled the security systems, and the guards still work for me.<eos> They'll look the other way.<eos> - Trust me.<eos> - I'll take my chances.<eos> With what?
Did you ever tell anyone that I work at the State's Attorney?<eos> - Why would I do that?<eos> - Just think.<eos> I don't know, like who?<eos> A boyfriend?
Thank you.<eos> You hungry?<eos> Starving.<eos> I am worried about you, though.<eos> How so?
She told me the same thing.<eos> - She's probably just making it up.<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> - That's not why.<eos> - Then why?
I dunno, you got someplace else to be?<eos> Nah, I was just wondering...<eos> RUSSELL: I haven't decided yet.<eos> D-MAN: Hey I thought, maybe we should get out of here.<eos> RUSSELL:
As a doctor, you're not concerned about concussions?<eos> - Absolutely.<eos> - Yeah, but he loves the game, always has.<eos> And let's face it, you know, contact sports help boys channel their aggression.<eos> And girls.
I can't afford to alienate my base.<eos> You won't be if you give your district a big enough win on the employment front... say, a new McGregor-Wyatt plant and a thousand jobs to go with it.<eos> I have to worry about my job first.<eos> I just can't take the risk.<eos> My apologies.
At least, not that I know of, anymore.<eos> I don't know if I do anymore.<eos> You think either of us will ever get married again?<eos> Oh, I'm not in any hurry, myself.<eos> You?
- There he is.<eos> - He confessed.<eos> - Okay.<eos> To who?<eos> - Me.
I will not make that mistake again.<eos> Roll call...<eos> Christian Kelly, Henry Roarke,<eos> Rebecca Sherman, and Thomas Roth.<eos> And now, thanks to a tip from an old friend,
It's so hard to say no to you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So I'll say maybe.<eos> What?<eos> Why?
Yeah, if you want us to look like losers.<eos> Hey, um, are you sure the guys are okay with me coming?<eos> Yeah, of course, why?<eos> This is just something you usually do together, and if I'm screwing it up, I don't have to go.<eos> Oh, why?
Are you kidding me?<eos> I would never murder anyone.<eos> Shut up and walk!<eos> - Goddamn it! - â€­<eos> Bryce?
Shut up and walk!<eos> - Goddamn it! - â€­<eos> Bryce?<eos> !<eos> Bryce!
Bryce?<eos> !<eos> Bryce!<eos> Kenneth!<eos> Bryce!
Kenneth!<eos> Bryce!<eos> Shit!<eos> Over there.<eos> Bryce!
I'm gonna find you sooner or later.<eos> - Ken!<eos> - Desna!<eos> Bryce!<eos> Bryce!
Besides, I have a friend at the motel who has a tracking jammer.<eos> I am gonna be fine.<eos> But are you sure you want to do this?<eos> Our foster parents ­did horrible things to Dean.<eos> - To Dean?
Big fan.<eos> I'm sorry, Batman, that's classified.<eos> My hands are tied.<eos> Strange that you would put it just that way.<eos> Why?
You can't, you can't do that, because we can't...<eos> Stop doing that, because we have to stay in town this weekend.<eos> Why do we have to stay in town this weekend?<eos> Because- - I don't want to talk about this.<eos> Why?
Depends on how much you like being on the wrong side of I.A. (inhales sharply)<eos> You know, you could've led with that, right? (scoffs) And miss watching you sweat it out?<eos> Wow, there's the Whiting that I know and love.<eos> So, what, you just hold this over my head for the rest of my career?<eos> Something like that.

The last name just came with it.<eos> - Call me Kelly Anne.<eos> - Teresa.<eos> I'm an executive consultant with Camila's company.<eos> Executive.
I wanted to tell you this in person.<eos> Teo will not be working with you from here on out.<eos> He was setting you up.<eos> Setting me up?<eos> With who?
If we cut off their transport route, his distributors will come crawling back to us.<eos> We just need to confirm that his tunnel's active.<eos> Well, if it is, destroy it.<eos> Take Teresa with you to the border.<eos> Why?
He sent his man Rivas to tip the DEA.<eos> A man who kills his own brother is a Judas.<eos> Yes, but he's our Judas.<eos> Lobito!<eos> Don Epifanio Vargas.
I don't feel guilty.<eos> What do you have to be ashamed of?<eos> How much time you got?<eos> Us?<eos> No, not us.
Well, I am.<eos> Well, then I guess all is forgiven.<eos> Todd. What?<eos> Will you drop me off at the other building, please?<eos> Why?
If you compare the partial prints found at the scene to Lindsey's from her WITSEC file, it proves she did this.<eos> And where's that report?<eos> It's on its way now.<eos> So you have nothing definitive here, now.<eos> Unreal.
What are you doing here?<eos> !<eos> I don't know what's behind door number one, but I'm pretty sure it's not a SeaDoo.<eos> I'm not leaving you alone to face...<eos> Earl?
Or to lay off the Earp girls.<eos> Thought never crossed my mind.<eos> You bring me the documents, I'll have your cash by morning.<eos> Much obliged.<eos> And Jeannie?
I'm so sorry, y'all.<eos> Fire must have got the most of him.<eos> Gators got the rest.<eos> Blood on the lanai ­and on the lawn was a match, and, we also found these, too.<eos> So sorry.
Shit!<eos> - What?<eos> - I have to pee again.<eos> I really, really want you to give me a case.<eos> Any case.
- Wynonna, take a day off. - Ooh.<eos> Get a spa treatment.<eos> Purgatory doesn't have any spas... unless you count the jacuzzi Willie drives around in his pick-up.<eos> - Go shopping?<eos> - Why?
Get it, Pol.<eos> This is my... This is Molly Ringwald.<eos> Virginia!<eos> I need your services outside.<eos> Mine?
I hired Krilov once. Never again.<eos> That's Julian Gale.<eos> I've been avoiding his calls, and I'm beginning to think that was a mistake.<eos> Bogdan Krilov and Julian Gale, directly or indirectly, they're working for Kaplan against us.<eos> Against you.
Only 4 warriors remain...<eos> Roan kom azgeda, luna kom flokru, guara kom podakru, and Octavia kom skaikru.<eos> I'm sorry about trikru, Indra.<eos> Octavia's doing well.<eos> Thanks to you.
Anyone up for a nice, quiet stroll through Park Slope?<eos> What?<eos> Nothing.<eos> It's just, it's not our typical day at the office.<eos> Why?
The world's most sought-after documents.<eos> The treasure chest you all came for.<eos> Good luck.<eos> You're gonna need it.<eos> Especially you two.
She's super smart, a bit of a maverick.<eos> Uh, for instance, she plans to release Jane.<eos> Jane's leaving?<eos> She's thinking about it.<eos> Why?
Because you're really, really not showing it.<eos> You are way more concerned about your alderman job<eos> - I'm missing a town hall today because I'm on shift.<eos> My first responder bill will probably die because of it.<eos> No thanks to your father, by the way.
This has to come from me.<eos> So, this just in.<eos> Gail forbids you from delivering our baby, and she's being a massive "B" about it.<eos> What?<eos> Why?
- My name is Peter.<eos> - Check.<eos> - That ain't no lie. - Check.<eos> I go pop, pop, fizz, fizz, oh, how sweet it is.<eos> Check! Check!
Wha... you could try saying that without smiling.<eos> I'm trying.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> What does it look like? I'm playing sad harmonica... in an apartment as empty as my heart.<eos> Why?
Do what you want to me.<eos> I have nothing to say to you.<eos> To any of you.
This is a hell of an opportunity is what it is. Yeah.<eos> And it's San Francisco, that's Abby's home.<eos> I mean, she's got to be at least a little bit excited about the prospect, no?<eos> Actually, I haven't told her yet.<eos> Okay, why not?
He's dead, huh?<eos> Fred specialized in cheating spouses, the kind who leave stains in cheap motel rooms.<eos> I imagine, occasionally, he needed you to run a DNA sample for him.<eos> When I went through Fred's financials yesterday, I noticed he wrote quite a few checks to you over the years.<eos> Just you.
That cover was mine.<eos> That punk ass kid comes in like he's Annie Leibovitz and I end up on page 15.<eos> Now I'm out here with these knuckleheads, freezing my tush off, trying to get pictures of Selena swapping spit with The Weeknd.<eos> You wouldn't happen to have a name for that punk ass kid?<eos> - Nah, sorry.
This is one of those things that needs to be talked about and addressed.<eos> Not saying anything can also be very dangerous.<eos> If Bryce doesn't have consequences, he's gonna keep doing what he's doing.<eos> She wanted me.<eos> Me.
Yes, I'm here to see Mr. Gu.<eos> He's a prosecutor on the fast track.<eos> No need to rattle his cage.<eos> Joon-young is doing well.<eos> With a little push...
What's your skill then, hmm?<eos> Electronics?<eos> Astrophysics?<eos> Satellite communications?<eos> Engineering?
- Don't!<eos> Tina?<eos> I need you to stop supplying the women for awhile.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> - Why?
What a beautiful doll.<eos> Isn't she pretty, Daddy?<eos> She's cute, but she's no kitten mouse.<eos> Baby, I got to run into town and pick up the horse feed - before Joey kills me.<eos> - Why?
What? Does she think we're a charity or something?<eos> Can I get some H?<eos> - Fuck off, you walking piece of shit!<eos> - Oh, I've got money. I don't want your money.<eos> - W... why?
What's Tina's problem?<eos> Nah, you'll need to be more specific.<eos> She won't sell me any more gear.<eos> Well, I told her not to.<eos> Why?
I know, love, I know, but... just have a word to her and make sure she's not gonna do anything stupid.<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> You know junkies, they'll tell you anything.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thanks, love.
Attention, compound. Attention, compound. Count will commence in ten minutes.- -<eos> Lovely morning, Miss Bennett.<eos> Mr Stewart.<eos> I should have told Will about us.<eos> Why?
Uh... Good, but we still need to get our way<eos> - out of the boxes.<eos> - Hang on! Hang on, Franky. What the fuck happened with Iman?<eos> ! - I told you, Ferguson killed her.<eos> - Yeah, but why?
Hide your seal on a holy site and they'll keep him locked away... forever.<eos> Holy shit, the seals!<eos> We need three magical seals to keep Clootie in his tomb.<eos> We tell no one else where we put them.<eos> Even each other.
Police!<eos> Shit!<eos> We organized this meeting as soon as we established a link between the murder of Niall Swift and the heart found on the loch shore.<eos> The purpose is to ensure your safety and to answer any of your questions.<eos> Annie?
I did say "a bit."<eos> Now...<eos> Black Badge wants it.<eos> My client was willing to pay through the nose for it.<eos> But why?
Did he tell you anything specific?<eos> He just said, "If we lose by one, I'm gonna feel like shit."<eos> But he never said why.<eos> Although, he did say that he just found it really hard to say no to him.<eos> Ravi or Brandon?
He just said, "If we lose by one, I'm gonna feel like shit."<eos> But he never said why.<eos> Although, he did say that he just found it really hard to say no to him.<eos> Ravi or Brandon?<eos> No, Clay.
It's still Nate Baldwin.<eos> If we get him angry, he'll undo everything.<eos> What the fuck do you mean you don't have it?<eos> I mean it was for sale, and now it's been sold.<eos> Who to?
He's hunting.<eos> I was looking for this.<eos> So you told him?<eos> - No, not yet.<eos> - Why?
And no matter what you do, I will find Ms. Gunnarsdottir.<eos> And I will enjoy feeling you experience her death... inch by inch, piece by piece.<eos> There's just one tiny problem with that plan.<eos> And what is that?<eos> Me.
The more he feels, the less he says.<eos> Like a masseuse.<eos> Waves... they need blood samples from both parents to do genetic testing.<eos> - He's gonna freak out.<eos> - Why?
- Well, at least it's not a big pile of "people hate Jessica."<eos> - That's your advice? - No.<eos> - No.<eos> Harvey, my advice is to give a big piece of new business to the person least likely to let anything go.<eos> - Louis.
- You're the boss, Kenny.<eos> Come on.<eos> Easy.<eos> Now you're still a little groggy from the surgery.<eos> Surgery?
Have Amira prep the O.R. We're coming in hot.<eos> Three, two, one.<eos> How can I help?<eos> Anything to get her heart beating.<eos> Uh, what about esmolol?
The night shift has the final run of the day, the obstacle relay.<eos> The day shift is in first place.<eos> The night shift has to post a time of less than two minutes, or they could be working weekends the next six months.<eos> Can they pull together as a team?<eos> Ready!
So, the ice caused the poisoning?<eos> Yeah. The company that caters the airline also delivers to several restaurants.<eos> Ice from the plane was switched with ice used for packing fish, seeps into the food.<eos> Look who's feeling better.<eos> Thanks to all of you.
As a matter of fact, you know what?<eos> The day shift's got this.<eos> Think I'm gonna take your advice, go try out a little me time.<eos> Have a good night, Dr. Clemmens.<eos> Yeah, you too.
[man, via communicator]<eos> Ms. Davenport, what exactly do you want to hear from us?<eos> Why come all this way?<eos> It's urgent.<eos> Our past?
Don't tell me you hate Yuzu Hanaki.<eos> No, no.<eos> I totally hate him.<eos> "Totally."<eos> Ayane, right.
-Sure thing.<eos> -Mr. Michima.<eos> -Yes?<eos> How is your novel coming along?<eos> Good, thanks to you.
- I don't know, man.<eos> She worked here and one day she stopped coming in.<eos> Next thing I know, she started showing up in these movies.<eos> And who's making these movies?<eos> Bubescu.
We haven't found his killer. Now we're headed to prison, where neither of us will survive the night.<eos> Don't worry, I got a plan to get us out of this mess.<eos> Your street smarts serve you well, Gregor.<eos> I'd save the praise until after the plan's complete.<eos> Why?
But even the assholes get girlfriends.<eos> It's easy for everybody, but not me.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> Trust me. It's hard for everybody.<eos> Not you.
You've done it before.<eos> Damn serpents!<eos> I can't send my troops.<eos> Jews won't do it again. Not a child. Not the...<eos> Not the Messiah.
Come to think of it, every big decision this family has made in the last eight years is because of dreams.<eos> Hush.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - You're not to ask.<eos> Why not?
We're safe here.<eos> No one knows what I've done.<eos> And you must never tell anyone.<eos> I know you have many questions. But you need to let them sleep in your heart for now.<eos> Why?
We can run anything through that blockade, but the whiskey always seems to get here first.<eos> I suppose the only neutral parties in any war are the people makin' money from it.<eos> Just want to give you the opportunity to make a little more.<eos> We need to get a message to him.<eos> "Him"?
All he has to do is walk away.<eos> Shut up.<eos> CLAIRE: Look at you.<eos> You're letting him beat you?<eos> That pathetic little shit?
Stephen, please.<eos> And you are?<eos> Wong. Wong.<eos> Just Wong?<eos> Like Adele?
I demand an apology right now.<eos> You will apologize to me.<eos> I will apologize...<eos> Thank you.<eos> To my men.
Okay.<eos> He, um... bites me... punches me, and hits me with a jump rope.<eos> Yesterday, after he came home from work, he scalded me with the tea kettle.<eos> You think you could tell the Sheriff what you just told me?<eos> The Sheriff?
God... please forgive me.<eos> Yeah... thought as much.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Oh, well.<eos> You, too.
Hey, that license number you gave Emir, I searched it.<eos> Took me a while 'cause the car's registered to a company with an address on a vacant lot.<eos> The property records tie back to what I've confirmed as a CIA front.<eos> - Emir was right.<eos> Unbelievable. - Yeah.
I have given you entry to the wealthiest woman in the kingdom.<eos> The rest is up to you.<eos> Your ladyship has perhaps heard that some of the stricken have not succumbed to the urge to feed upon the living, and in so doing have maintained their human ways.<eos> And they have managed to resist this most primal of zombie urges, how?<eos> Their iron-clad constitutions?
I never carry a wallet when I'm working.<eos> Ruins the lines of my suit.<eos> But, how about a crisp high five?<eos> Okay.<eos> Merry Christmas.
Daddy left before I was conceived.<eos> Ever had a cigarette put out on your skin?<eos> Where else do you put one out?<eos> I was molested.<eos> Me too.
Your call.<eos> Two-to-one he drinks the deer cum.<eos> Deer cum?<eos> Drink it. Drink the deer cum.<eos> Deer cum.
Two-to-one he drinks the deer cum.<eos> Deer cum?<eos> Drink it. Drink the deer cum.<eos> Deer cum.<eos> Deer cum! Deer cum! Deer cum!
Rick. What's up, man?<eos> Oh, Will, this is Katherine Dunn, Vice President of our Client Services.<eos> It's good to have you back.<eos> Get ready to have your mind blown. Because I'm taking video résumés to the next level. Okay?<eos> Ready for this?
But don't make any other moves.<eos> We've all worked way too hard to maintain the balance of power in this dump.<eos> Dump?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Dump.
You know, in reading your book, i couldn't help wondering about the basis of your discovery.<eos> If it started with your journey to remove sex from your life, as you're suggesting others do.<eos> Well, the book's not about me.<eos> It's about people who put their lives aside in pursuit of their next orgasm.<eos> Orgasm. Orgasm!
I thought you knew!<eos> No, I just didn't want Vip to think I was uncool!<eos> I miss not knowing things with you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Me, too.
Our most overrated appendage.<eos> When not allowed the use of them, you'd be surprised how quickly feet can be trained to do the exact same thing.<eos> Your son is doing wonderfully.<eos> From what the school tells my offshore accountant... He's incredibly smart.<eos> Your accountant?
And here.<eos> What's that?<eos> I missed you, too.<eos> Alexanya!<eos> Moo-Moo!
And we both know he's only worth that much if it's a unifying title fight.<eos> You need Vinny to lose.<eos> It's worth just as much to us if Vinny wins.<eos> We'll make Dele-Rossi the under-card, put Vinny in the ring with Sugar Ray or Duran.<eos> Duran!
SPACE DEFENSE HEADQUARTERS AREA 51<eos> - General.<eos> - This better be good.<eos> My wife and I were enjoying a very nice morning in a very expensive bed and breakfast.<eos> Sorry, sir.
Maybe you guys should stay with me for a while.<eos> I think I would really like that.<eos> Yes, so would I.<eos> - Are you okay? - I am.<eos> Thanks to you.
Bye.<eos> I come, I come.<eos> Philippe forms now his own team?<eos> Yes, he wants to work other topics.<eos> Ecology.
Fuck me, right?<eos> Wait, do you guys have any proof of this?<eos> Go to the Dark Aisle.<eos> Beyond the ice.<eos> Why?
That's a little disquieting.<eos> Oh, the laughing's worse. Trust me.<eos> - You spoken to Max lately?<eos> - Oh, don't talk about Max.<eos> Why not, Tom?
Everyone's included!<eos> Is everyone included?<eos> What about... What about the... The Mormons?<eos> What about the Jews for Jesus?<eos> -What about Scientologists?
I'm gonna be honest with you, I have been farting this entire time.<eos> Okay, you know what, take me to your personal safe right now.<eos> We don't need money where we're going.<eos> -Where are we going?<eos> -For glory.
Get the fuck back in the house.<eos> VVCDIVIANI Fuck you!<eos> This is my house.<eos> Don't be telling me to get the fuck back inside my house.<eos> Breach!
- As many as you want.<eos> Do you have money for your friend?<eos> What?<eos> You have money for your friend?<eos> Why?
Will you read it?<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> Why?<eos> Please.
Sorry's not good enough.<eos> How could you do that? Insult a woman like that?<eos> What's the matter with you?<eos> Well, my country felt insulted by yours.<eos> And not only women.
How could you do that? Insult a woman like that?<eos> What's the matter with you?<eos> Well, my country felt insulted by yours.<eos> And not only women.<eos> Children.
Think you look like Paul Newman?<eos> No, but Charles Bronson, maybe.<eos> There's someone else you're going to have to learn to forgive.<eos> Carlos.<eos> Why?
Young man, pardon me, can you please tell me where I can find Mr. Mike Williams?<eos> Yes, Sir, he's in the ET shops on the second deck by the coffee shop.<eos> - Thank you much.<eos> - Have a wonderful day, Sir.<eos> And you, Sir.
- That is a genuine dinosaur tooth.<eos> Gas alarm in the mud pits, again, same one goes off every time, all fall down.<eos> - Hey, Roy!<eos> - I got it, you gotta get outta here.<eos> Too late.
Are you kidding me?<eos> I put it right in your hands and you kick it out of bounds like that.<eos> I used to look up to you.<eos> You used to be my hero.<eos> Why?
Right here.<eos> Now, come on now.<eos> Let's get you cleaned up.<eos> Yeah, yeah! So that's the work we do around here. And we do all the moaning and groaning because that makes sure it's over faster.<eos> Why? Why?
And take the greatest care yourself.<eos> With Love, Abe.<eos> Who is ready to hit the beach?<eos> Oh my goodness.<eos> Unbelievable!
I used it to get to the Tokyo loop.<eos> That led me to the nearest loop back in 1942, where I wound up joining the navy.<eos> Don't ask.<eos> Then I spent 2 months in London trying...<eos> Ready.
It's fucking genius.<eos> I thought that you said you sold, like, seized weapons to gun nuts on the Internet.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> Now I only sell to one gun nut.<eos> Oh, yeah? Which one?
If there's an entire defense industry, why would the Pentagon want to buy anything from you?<eos> They don't want to, they have to.<eos> Remember Little League?<eos> How, at the end of the season, they'd give out that big MVP trophy and that one kid would always win it?<eos> Yeah, Evan Talbot.
That's the AEY guarantee, bitch.<eos> We drive through all triangles, including your mom's.<eos> Hey, Kip, snap a photo of us, pal.<eos> All right.<eos> Ready?
We have been riding for six months.<eos> - And we've lost twenty men.<eos> - But we survived.<eos> Yes.<eos> By chance.
Captain.<eos> It's good to see you, kid.<eos> Captain Glover, sir.<eos> How'd you get down, son?<eos> Doss.
But he didn't.<eos> One in 68 children in this country are diagnosed with a form of autism.<eos> But if you can put aside for a moment what your pediatrician and all the other NTs have said about your son...<eos> What? NTs?<eos> Neurotypicals.
I'll take you back to casino.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> So you're working for them.<eos> I'm police.<eos> Honorable.
- no.<eos> I'm not gay.<eos> - Oh, you know, you don't have to be hetero to be in the alliance.<eos> It's just to support...<eos> - sorry, sorry.
Teaching , or being humiliated ?<eos> Both. I don't know why you ever thought I could teach that class ?<eos> Oh I knew you couldn't. - What ?<eos> You set me up to fail ?<eos> Why ?
Because that's really our strength.<eos> Look, your friend is going to be in quarantine.<eos> That's where they take the sick fish.<eos> And the one and only one way into that place is Becky.<eos> Hi, Becky.
So she can forget us all together?<eos> - I trust Becky.<eos> - You trust her?<eos> Becky's eating a cup!<eos> Becky! Becky!
Nemo?<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> Thank you for taking care of Dory.<eos> Dory! She's still in the truck.<eos> Becky! Fetch Dory!
That's right! So what do you say?<eos> Release! Release! Release!<eos> I was gonna say, "Okay."<eos> Not good.<eos> - Oh no!
You will be asked a number of questions By the solicitor who is in the court room upstairs.<eos> After each question, you must answer into the camera.<eos> It that all clear?<eos> Can you give him a message?<eos> - Who?
After each question, you must answer into the camera.<eos> It that all clear?<eos> Can you give him a message?<eos> - Who?<eos> Ray.
That's it.<eos> See you soon, my boy.<eos> See you soon, Raymond!<eos> I want to thank. You saved my life.<eos> Especially Simon.
Yeah.<eos> It hurts, but it's not gonna kill you.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> We should have never shown him the pictures.<eos> What pictures?
It hurts, but it's not gonna kill you.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> We should have never shown him the pictures.<eos> What pictures?<eos> Figgis.
- What?<eos> Yeah!<eos> - You both ready?<eos> - Ready.<eos> - Yes? - Ready.
How much?<eos> She owes me more money than you can ever dream, than you can ever imagine, than you can ever... $10,892.<eos> Plus interest, my love.<eos> Well, we got $5,000 here, and it's close to another thousand right there.<eos> Too bad, my friend.
How are you? I brought you some flowers.<eos> Thank you, honey!<eos> You're not gonna believe the day that I had.<eos> Guess who likes being a man-bird as much as I do?<eos> - Who?
Grab the chips and follow us. Come on, let's go.<eos> - Chopper's ready. - Yeah, get 'em. And get the chips!<eos> Get back, get back, get back!<eos> - I'm almost out.<eos> - Me too.
One...<eos> Two...<eos> Jesus, Jeff! Everybody down, right now.<eos> - I miss those guys.<eos> - Me too.
- I know you're scared. - I've given everything I have.<eos> We all are, but we came far to get here.<eos> Suffered losses too painful to bear to make this our home.<eos> We did it.<eos> All of us.
- Not for us though?<eos> You can take your luggage and shove it up your ass!<eos> - Deep down...!<eos> Be nice or I will whip you, rogue.<eos> - Nice to Saracen!
You can take your luggage and shove it up your ass!<eos> - Deep down...!<eos> Be nice or I will whip you, rogue.<eos> - Nice to Saracen!<eos> What Saracen?
- And you have a neck of a bull.<eos> Therefore, we must immediately get out.<eos> - I am not going, I don't trust it.<eos> What do you not trust?<eos> - Me?
17 million disappeared. "Seventeen!"<eos> That money is from federal agents. "It's my money!"<eos> And I will not allow to empty my pockets.<eos> No, no, sir.<eos> Especially for this idiot.
These are American heroes, here at the personal invitation of Mr. Norman Oglesby.<eos> We'll take charge now, thank you very much.<eos> Come on, guys.<eos> - Nice work, dude.<eos> - Hey, girl.

Sign over the vessel and you will redeem the house.<eos> Report to work monday morning, and you will receive a salary and a pension.<eos> And give up the Wonder?<eos> Otherwise, we can not help you<eos> Or your mother.
No, sweetheart, I know you want to fix this.<eos> It's what you do. But we've tried.<eos> All right? We've been trying and look where it's gotten us.<eos> And I think the space is gonna be good for him.<eos> For all of us.
You idiot!<eos> Get it now!<eos> Men gathered here today hailing from Persia,<eos> Greece,<eos> Arabia,
Good girl. Good girl.<eos> We pay tribute to Caesar, and give thanks for his virtue and his mercy<eos> A grand arena, ten years in the making.<eos> You will have the pleasure for the first time in Judean history.<eos> Ready?
- To add to your army.<eos> - How many, in your army?<eos> - Five.<eos> - Hundred?<eos> Five.
Did you see the groupings on Hackett?<eos> They hit her 3 times. The 3rd time while she was spinning through the fucking air.<eos> I've been thinking about that, because that's all that I'm thinking about.<eos> They had us. And they let us walk.<eos> Why?
Interesting choice of footwear.<eos> Patrick says they make me look like a leprechaun drag queen.<eos> He was being nice.<eos> - Don't smile at me like that.<eos> - Why not?
Because I don't know what it means.<eos> Where did you pick up your exotic tastes?<eos> - What do you mean by that?<eos> - It can't be from around here.<eos> Why not?
I'm sorry that I yelled at you before.<eos> Please, take off the chain.<eos> This time I'll help you.<eos> I promise.<eos> Tiberius...
People can go to hell.<eos> I'm through with it.<eos> Maybe you should think about taking some time out. You know?<eos> Some sick leave.<eos> Sick leave?
TEST PERIOD ENDS NOW!<eos> Have you committed to helping protect?<eos> Huffy?<eos> Look in your pants.<eos> - Why?
Women do not need self-empowerment.<eos> Stop it.<eos> - Oh my God!<eos> - I am going to vomit!<eos> - Why?
I'm a first-ballot hall of famer.<eos> - I crap out high-end clients.<eos> - That's a little too much information for me.<eos> And they keep coming back.<eos> Why?
- I can't walk.<eos> - Rub some dirt on it.<eos> Don't put no dirt on no bullet holes.<eos> - Hey, man, we the brothers-in-law!<eos> - Not anymore.
It's a revolutionary, political, sexual and poetic force.<eos> You're not one of those guys that thinks that Jim Morrison is still alive, are you?<eos> - No.<eos> - Good.<eos> Why?
Thank you both so much.<eos> One second.<eos> You're fired.<eos> What?<eos> Why?
Please give me back the Zootopia I love.<eos> Come on, Hopps.<eos> The new mayor wants to see us.<eos> The mayor?<eos> Why?
And this is the city in the year 2025.<eos> Hosting a minimum of 1.5 million.<eos> Port is there.<eos> Industrial city.<eos> University.
Make a friend.<eos> - Oh, okay. You're hurting me a little bit.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> I want to introduce you to Dex.<eos> - Dex? Dex-Dex?
- Oh, okay. You're hurting me a little bit.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> I want to introduce you to Dex.<eos> - Dex? Dex-Dex?<eos> - Yeah.
Being a royal pain.<eos> Yes, that's why you're here, I suppose?<eos> You miss me.<eos> You've finally succumbed to my...<eos> My mature charm.
Maria, let's go.<eos> - Bye, Maria. - Bye.<eos> They were big animals.<eos> The woolly mammoth was bigger than an elephant, the aurochs, a cow like a cart horse.<eos> Why?
I know what I said.<eos> Whoa.<eos> Elephants.<eos> - Bow your head.<eos> - Why?
For what reason, man village?<eos> I don't have a choice.<eos> There's a tiger hunting me.<eos> Really?<eos> Why a tiger?
I came up here without an invitation.<eos> It was extremely presumptuous of me.<eos> Let me interrupt myself. I just gotta say... You guys are so much handsomer in person than anyone knows.<eos> No one ever gets up close to you.<eos> Why?
Billy!<eos> Hello.<eos> How was your day?<eos> Not good.<eos> Why?
And you told me.<eos> You told me your name.<eos> And I wrote it down.<eos> I need my Bible!<eos> Why?
Thank you.<eos> Catherine. I'd like to thank you for this visit.<eos> - You're leaving?<eos> - Yes, I must.<eos> Why?
Okay, I'm messing this up.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I'm a scientist, a geologist.<eos> But I want to help you.<eos> Why?
Goldstein?<eos> Did you just butt in on the investigative team again?<eos> Where have you been? What?<eos> Where'd she pick you up?<eos> Me?
Show me.<eos> My boy, the sooner we find this child, the sooner you can put that pain in the past where it belongs.<eos> I want you to have this, Credence.<eos> I would trust very few with it.<eos> Very few.
He owns it with, like, two other guys.<eos> And you just use it whenever? Yeah.<eos> Actually, no.<eos> Just tonight.<eos> Why tonight?
- Like, who?<eos> It's not a tough question.<eos> Like cops, who else is there?<eos> Uh, I talked to one.<eos> - Why?
There's your solution.<eos> Burn him in public.<eos> God forbids cremation.<eos> He also forbids labor on the Sabbath, and yet here you are.<eos> Tribune.
He also forbids labor on the Sabbath, and yet here you are.<eos> Tribune.<eos> - Burn who?<eos> - The crucified Nazarene.<eos> - Why?
Bring it.<eos> I want nothing touched here.<eos> Post a watch, have everything leaving Jerusalem searched.<eos> Arrest anyone claiming the Nazarene lives, and find out where they heard it.<eos> Yes, Tribune.
Examine each for marks of the crucified.<eos> Dig them up?<eos> Every one.<eos> And bring him to me presently.<eos> Tribune.
- When that turns, wake me.<eos> - Sir.<eos> You, up.<eos> Move.<eos> Tribune.
Nothing can be done to me now.<eos> I said what they...<eos> What was proclaimed.<eos> Say it again.<eos> Why?
Come on, move!<eos> I'll block the end and work my way back!<eos> No!<eos> Tribune, anything?<eos> Tribune?
Nothing.<eos> Stand down.<eos> Return to camp.<eos> Sir?<eos> Tribune?
Pilate, Caiaphas and Rome.<eos> Then there's trouble this way as well.<eos> Have faith, Tribune.<eos> Peter, let's walk a little farther.<eos> Why?
Brother!<eos> Wait!<eos> That way?<eos> I doubt we'll ever hear from them again.<eos> Tribune?
The headmistress said they never went in.<eos> Yeah, well...<eos> Your kids have told us everything we wanna know already.<eos> They're here with us right now.<eos> Oh, my God!
Go on.<eos> It's for me son.<eos> - I can't do it. It wouldn't be fair on...<eos> - On who?<eos> The dog?
You understand?<eos> Even if we are family...<eos> Come on, come on, come on, come on! Pick up the phone!<eos> At the tone, please record your message. When you finish recording, you may hang...<eos> Rosie?
- Let's go, squirt. Grab the door.<eos> - You guys good? - Yeah.<eos> Todd keeps having nightmares. We're still living in the one-bedroom shithole he grew up in.<eos> So he's not sleeping very well. I'm sorry.<eos> What about the interview from the other day?
You said it was a doll? - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah, I remember that thing.<eos> - I bagged it.<eos> I gave it to her father.<eos> - Her father?
See what I can do?<eos> I'll show you.<eos> Think about the person you love most in your life.<eos> Your wife. Mother.<eos> Daughter.
- You Sara?<eos> Yeah.<eos> How do you know my name?<eos> No trust him.<eos> Who?
if you do something to him...<eos> Did you ever give a thought...<eos> For the souls of these children? Have you ever thought?<eos> We give people... a better life...<eos> Sick patients?
I'm going to bring you with me to Providence to meet them.<eos> When they see that it's possible, that you were possible, it will change everything.<eos> I understand it's hard to take my word for it.<eos> But, if you don't believe me, believe your mother.<eos> My mother?
It was like I was her and seeing it all through her eyes.<eos> I still can't believe my mom is from this place.<eos> Well, I can see why she left.<eos> Do you trust him?<eos> David.
As long as she stays in the bureau, she's safe.<eos> She's too valuable to him.<eos> I'll need a head start.<eos> When David asks, I want you to tell him that I left you behind.<eos> - Why?
If I called you, it was to save her.<eos> It was to heal her.<eos> - I did not come to heal her. - Yes you did.<eos> I came to heal you.<eos> Me?
How'd you find me?<eos> Have you tried the shrimp?<eos> Close that pretty little mouth of yours and just listen.<eos> This is dedicated to the sloth of my dreams.<eos> That guy?
- Now he's joshin'.<eos> He gone.<eos> Almost.<eos> Whole side of his head's rotten.<eos> Yeah, well, better him than us.
This year like every other year. The Western Union, moving money for better... Super Star competition's trophy goes to our very own...<eos> Gaurav Chandna.<eos> Give him a big hand!<eos> I want to thank my Mummy.<eos> My Papa.
Gaurav Chandna.<eos> Give him a big hand!<eos> I want to thank my Mummy.<eos> My Papa.<eos> My God.
If someone comes to my house, drinks my expensive wine. Flirts with my wife. Must I just stand by and watch?<eos> You have no time.<eos> Let someone else flirt with me.<eos> Actually you're right.<eos> But not this moron.
Let me translate it in a language you understand.<eos> Lawyer.<eos> Two options.<eos> Handcuffs if you are nasty, without handcuffs if you are nice.<eos> Nasty.
- Pregnant?<eos> No, definitely not.<eos> We're taking a break.<eos> It's nobody's fault.<eos> So sorry, Tony.
- You ever been to Germany?<eos> - No.<eos> - Oh, you'll love it.<eos> - I can't go to Germany!<eos> - Why?
The first sprint final of the day, the 100-yard dash!<eos> They will love you or they will hate you.<eos> Does not matter.<eos> 'Cause either way, when you're out there, you're on your own.<eos> Set.
- No. Nothing.<eos> - Not to her, Mama.<eos> - Nothing.<eos> - To you.<eos> To you.
You all!<eos> The FBI agent... that was my dad.<eos> - He was the one that...<eos> - Who let all those people die.<eos> All of them.
- Trust me. No woman can truly love a man who listens to Phil Collins.<eos> Listen.<eos> I think she's having an affair.<eos> What?<eos> Why?
Sorry. Really don't be.<eos> He was a drunk.<eos> He deserved it.<eos> And me ma's in and out of hospital.<eos> Why?
- Yes, life is OK, sweetie, but...<eos> Come on, be honest.<eos> We're falling asleep.<eos> Where has the time gone when we...<eos> A bit rock 'n' roll.
Welcome to the security guard training course.<eos> Those of you with a criminal record... may as well leave now. And save themselves the registration fee.<eos> Couldn't you say that before?<eos> I came all the way from Antwerp.<eos> Sorry, guys.
But it's not good.<eos> - Those guys are ruining our business.<eos> - That's how we lost Manu, isn't it?<eos> You didn't even have the balls to tell me.<eos> Me.
Sorry.<eos> Are you coming in?<eos> No?<eos> Okay.<eos> Bye.
They're staying with me.<eos> Children, I'm sorry that you have to witness this, but I don't think your father is fit to attend the funeral.<eos> We're not gonna let you put her in the ground!<eos> Who do you think the police are gonna listen to?<eos> Me?
Right.<eos> - Say hi to Bob.<eos> - I will do.<eos> - Good luck.<eos> - Yeah, you too.
I didn't notice you there.<eos> Do I know you?<eos> Name's Jebediah... been here such a long time.<eos> And what is your name, kind sir?<eos> Reggie.
Don't get agitated.<eos> Please, just relax.<eos> It's probably time I should bring you back.<eos> Everything's all right.<eos> Reggie.
Let's do this!<eos> Dear Chicago, the world knows you as the birthplace of the skyscraper, deep dish pizza,<eos> Don Cornelius,<eos> Kanye West, and the home of the Cubs, Bulls, and undisputed queen of daytime television,<eos> Oprah.
He's at the park.<eos> Cornell Square.<eos> Cal!<eos> Hell, yeah, that's what I like to hear.<eos> You all ready? You all ready?
And then Tom took you home.<eos> I'm sorry, Tom...<eos> - Stop fucking saying that!<eos> I know you're sorry.<eos> -I'm sorry.
She said: "Hey, handsome, do you want to know something?"<eos> Leave the soap opera for when we're outside! Let's get the fuck down there.<eos> Jesus fucking Christ!<eos> Come on, move it!<eos> - All ready?
My entire family saw your photo.<eos> And nobody liked me?<eos> Except me.<eos> - Can we meet?<eos> - Why?
When was the accident?<eos> Um... day before last.<eos> You go to the hospital?<eos> No.<eos> - Why not?
-and raise your feet sideways... -Major?<eos> Major? Over.<eos> [Major] The damages caused by the shock waves would be limited to non-vital limb loss- [garbled speech] -[static]<eos> Shuman maneuver, my ass.<eos> Perfect.
I'll take it to a mechanic tomorrow and get it fixed.<eos> Those repairman couldn't figure out how to work your respirator.<eos> Don't worry, I'll fix it.<eos> We got to get out of here.<eos> Why?
Stars for Star.<eos> So your contract's in there.<eos> You gotta get that signed by 7:30.<eos> You get it to Room 233 for Krystal.<eos> 7:30?
- Oh, yeah.<eos> You just gotta keep her in your prayers, darling.<eos> We're coming from the Covenant House. We're trying to help...<eos> - What's the matter with her?<eos> - ...homeless children.
It's all fake.<eos> - When are they coming?<eos> - How should I know.<eos> - Come on, man, I got a lot of shit to do.<eos> - Oh, God, sorry about that.
And get those troopers away from us.<eos> What should I do?<eos> Keep the engine running. You're our only way out of here.<eos> Cargo shuttle SW-0608, be prepared to receive inspection team.<eos> Ready?
- Just be quiet!<eos> Should I call an ambulance?<eos> No, no, that'll make him feel old.<eos> Yeah, he'd never forgive you.<eos> Me? Yeah.
Ed, rising to the top in our world can sometimes be hard on a man.<eos> You think you're making strides, you think you're taking the initiative.<eos> And then, the next minute, they grind your work out of existence.<eos> They didn't use it?<eos> Why not?
It's all about finding the pressure point. Everything else is just pushing on it.<eos> Looks like you're being summoned.<eos> ...we have to pay extra... Marwan?<eos> May I interrupt? This is my boyfriend, Dave.<eos> Hello, Dave.
She's got dark hair, about yea high.<eos> Name's Amelia.<eos> She might be from the neighborhood.<eos> - No, can't help you, buddy.<eos> - No? Sorry.
No. No, you just gave her up.<eos> I asked you one simple question. You gave me all the information. I thought that's what you wanted.<eos> What?<eos> Now, I'm very sorry that you didn't get the message.<eos> Me, too.
Thank you.<eos> See you next time.<eos> Hello?<eos> Yes.<eos> Uh, no.
- I don't care.<eos> - I need to brush my teeth. I don't have an extra.<eos> It's not my problem. That's fine.<eos> Good. I'm fine with this.<eos> Yeah, me too.
I'm glad to hear it.<eos> The rest will come around.<eos> What we're about to go into, this mission... it will almost certainly require the use of deadly force.<eos> I need to know you're prepared to do whatever is necessary.<eos> Even against your own people.
The Federation that Daekon mentioned?<eos> It is destined for so much more than you realize.<eos> So, we're on the same path as the others?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Romulans,
I can do whatever I like!<eos> And do you know why this is happening?<eos> Why?<eos> Because of you!<eos> - Because of me?
Uh, no, I'm the grocery boy.<eos> Well, grocery man. You know.<eos> I own the shop, actually.<eos> Okay. I'm Malcolm, by the way.<eos> Hi.
That'll about break us.<eos> Maybe there's something we could do to work it out.<eos> Some sort of special deal.<eos> You thinking about selling your car?<eos> Oh, um, sorry, ma'am.
- What about Boston? Boston's only a couple of hours away.<eos> And Vic says there's a great high school here.<eos> And we'll be saving money by investing in a house.<eos> - That's right?<eos> - Yeah, yeah.
It was just me and my wife.<eos> So... You guys, uh... kind of became my family after that.<eos> And, uh... when I washed up here, I was sitting right in that chair over there, and, uh... I was just very lost.<eos> Ruthie, these cookies are really good.<eos> Ruthie?
Do you have any?<eos> I have two daughters.<eos> But I'm a widow.<eos> This place killed my husband.<eos> Radiation.
Uranium.<eos> The largest seam in the world.<eos> That explains a lot.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> And you.
Ever see a rhino charge?<eos> That hurts.<eos> - I like it!<eos> - Me, too!<eos> Me, too.
It is all over the police scanner, they are hunting you.<eos> - What happened up there?<eos> - Tell him, Raph.<eos> Tell him how you broke rank and got us all exposed.<eos> For the most selfish reason.
Hey, what's the matter?<eos> They asked me to take the case to the Supreme Court.<eos> Is that any reason to be like this?<eos> - I said no.<eos> - Why?
We were a little loose-lipped... - ...if you know what I mean. - Oopsie.<eos> But no, yeah. You were telling me how you talked to the scientist... - ...and everything and...<eos> I remember it because, um, it was about MS... and my mom has that.<eos> Oh, yeah, no, I remember, yeah.<eos> Sorry, yeah.
- Call your friend in Compliance.<eos> - Not happening.<eos> Get her to get us the personnel file for Erin Manning.<eos> She's not gonna do that.<eos> - Why?
Hey, guys, listen.<eos> I was thinking about applying to the academy in the fall and I was just wondering if maybe you'd put in a good word, tell 'em I helped you out.<eos> Oh, yeah, we'll jump right on that.<eos> Special agent Wells here will personally inform the FBI director.<eos> Maybe even the president.
Radiation levels are off the charts...<eos> We're ready for the next phase.<eos> We need to get a sample off Phoebe, now!<eos> You tell anyone about this?<eos> No. Just you.
He proposed to me.<eos> Next full moon, when my uncle visits his mine, he wants to elope to Japan.<eos> What did you say?<eos> I said I wasn't sure.<eos> Why?
I have no idea.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll talk to you tomorrow.<eos> Well, I can't stay there, either.<eos> Sorry about that.
I wanna have sex.<eos> I wish there was some way I could pretend to do it.<eos> It's called masturbation.<eos> It's kinda like sex.<eos> - But by yourself?
- Let's Skype real long soon.<eos> - My Skype's working again.<eos> She should work less.<eos> She's doing great.<eos> Willi?
I found the purest way to serve his sacred will.<eos> Enough of that.<eos> We need to beat God.<eos> I take their faith away.<eos> From the child, the parents, the family.
It wasn't even my board.<eos> Did you not have a cigarette for him or something?<eos> No, I had a cigarette and I gave him a cigarette. Then he followed me... I don't know.<eos> I'd rather live in dorms than, live in a weird area like this.<eos> Why?
You don't play games, either one of you, ever?<eos> Games are for children.<eos> My master Kraznys would sometimes make us play games.<eos> There, that's a start.<eos> - Only the girls.
And it's just team building. This is what you do.<eos> I don't do team building for drug rings.<eos> I do it for corporate...<eos> - Ever hear of corporate crime? - That's not...<eos> - Y'all ready?
But then he started drinking again.<eos> - He did?<eos> But he told me he stopped.<eos> He stopped... and then he started again.<eos> Why?
That's just all they had.<eos> That's all they had?<eos> I'm gonna get a pen. Okay.<eos> I really would love to watch a movie with you... It's just, I have to be up at like 6:00... To help my mom, that's not a line.<eos> Your mom?
This is Mrs Wheatley!<eos> Nurse Franklin, Dr Turner's in the delivery room, we have a deep transverse arrest.<eos> Or maybe we should go straight to Della and Nahima.<eos> One way or another, I think you two will end up on first name terms!<eos> Oh, Nahima!
Leader was a former Gitmo detainee.<eos> Yeah, those guys usually don't hold a grudge.<eos> Jack.<eos> Mark Geist.<eos> Oz. Pleasure.
Yo, what you doin'?<eos> Come on.<eos> Shades.<eos> You like my Biggie photo?<eos> Me, too.
I'll call some people and we get started on this in here.<eos> Good.<eos> I see you been at it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You, too.
"I... I have to take responsibility for what I did, the reason I'm here"?<eos> What, you mean, like, the... the 12 steps?<eos> Yeah, yeah, unless you were set up.<eos> I know I was set up.<eos> Me, too.
The guards established a fight ring and the convicts fight until they're broken.<eos> What happens to them after that, I don't know.<eos> That's why my face looks the way it does.<eos> And I may have dragged you into this bullshit unintentionally.<eos> - Me?
The thing my cousin built needs to continue.<eos> And you're gonna be the one to run it?<eos> No.<eos> I need help.<eos> Me?
Let me help you.<eos> You got skills.<eos> Likewise.<eos> My father.<eos> My uncle.
Call it what you will, but... like it or not,<eos> I finally accepted that that someone had to be me.<eos> Maybe I could've helped you.<eos> This burden is bigger than you.<eos> Or me.
- Yeah, yeah.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I'll bet you got a deal on that one.<eos> I did-- oh, we did get a good deal in it, yes.<eos> - Why?
- All right, shut the fuck up, man!<eos> I'm trying to tell you a story.<eos> Fuck Key Flo!<eos> All right?<eos> Why?
I started doing all the math, and I thought about it.<eos> It's 'cause motherfuckers like you don't pay shit.<eos> Therefore, I can't buy no house like this.<eos> I gotta always chase a motherfucker down... and tonight, on Purge night of all nights... they give me the slip?<eos> Me?
Therefore, I can't buy no house like this.<eos> I gotta always chase a motherfucker down... and tonight, on Purge night of all nights... they give me the slip?<eos> Me?<eos> All the white motherfuckers... that work there, and they gave it to the mixed nigga?<eos> Why?
So how does it work?<eos> Well, the guy you hire takes the card the usher hands him at the door... and when he hands it back at the end he's signed your name on it. That's it.<eos> You think a handwriting specialist pores over each card... back where they keep the records?<eos> No. All you have to do is pay somebody.<eos> - Yeah, but who?
Guess what.<eos> His name really is Duane Reade.<eos> There's a warrant out on him right now, and he's got a record:<eos> breaking and entering, burglary, agg assault, and always with a... guess.<eos> - A knife?
No.<eos> - Dad?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> I don't want to have Communion.<eos> Why not?
I don't want to go to church.<eos> But you have to.<eos> You told me to make my own decisions.<eos> - Well, not yet.<eos> - Why not?
Do you know it?<eos> Think so.<eos> When I take you, you'd have to promise not to tell anyone.<eos> Stuff there I wanna show you.<eos> But only you.
The old Sullivan's house.<eos> You know it?<eos> If I take you to them you have to promise me you won't tell anyone.<eos> I want to show you.<eos> But only you.
You were with me...<eos> Friday night.<eos> Franklin Shed.<eos> Okay?<eos> - Why?
Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.<eos> No, it's okay. Just a question.<eos> I'm not pointing the finger at anyone, and this conversation never happened, right?<eos> But do any of you blokes know anything about Travis Kingston and Grayson's daughter?<eos> Eliza?
Your mother has lost a lot of blood.<eos> She needs a transfusion, now.<eos> How is she?<eos> Do you know Mum's blood type?<eos> - No, why?
Oh, shit.<eos> What?<eos> It's the spare keys to the Jag. To Anna's car.<eos> By the time you have read this, I will be gone and what I leave behind is some of the pain that others have inflicted on me.<eos> To all the parents and their children.
To those who have laughed at me turned their back on me.<eos> Kettering Hotel, Deb speaking.<eos> Yeah, she was just here.<eos> She's taken Matilda to a concert.<eos> Why?
Too late.<eos> It's already been sent. Express mail.<eos> Hey, how do you like this?<eos> - Love.<eos> - Me, too.
I wasn't in the Pot Palace.<eos> I've never been there.<eos> Where were you last night around midnight?<eos> In Brockton, at the Motel 24 with Todd.<eos> Brockton.
He said he just saw Katrin go into her apartment.<eos> How'd she get home so fast?<eos> She must have dumped the cash card<eos> - to Nicky when we lost her.<eos> - But why here?
Yes.<eos> Going to get ready.<eos> Don't.<eos> I just sent Kiki home.<eos> - Why?
- Gee, I didn't expect that to get there until Friday at the earliest.<eos> - Do you mind telling me what you're doing shipping four cases of Inst-A-Mix to one of our operators?<eos> - Look, if you don't want to make a profit, that's fine.<eos> But don't stop the rest of us.<eos> - Us?
- Do you mind telling me what you're doing shipping four cases of Inst-A-Mix to one of our operators?<eos> - Look, if you don't want to make a profit, that's fine.<eos> But don't stop the rest of us.<eos> - Us?<eos> - Us.
Look, your mother... Your mother's very emotional right now.<eos> And i understand that;<eos> she lost nicole. We all lost nicole.<eos> But... She shouldn't be talking to you about these things.<eos> Why?
I don't know why you want to ask the dealer for another card.<eos> Because I know it's an ace.<eos> No, you don't!<eos> You turn over control of a demonstration to the opponent, you don't know what's going to happen.<eos> And certainly not to the defendant himself.
- Okay, now, that is a very serious charge, 45... uh...<eos> Okay, can you... just please elaborate for me?<eos> Well, like, when they took us out shopping, they gave them an hour at Target and only gave us 30 minutes at Ross!<eos> Them? Us?<eos> Uh...
And only his judgment concerns me.<eos> Shall we throw him through the Moon Door?<eos> My lord.<eos> My lord, I have always been faithful to House Arryn.<eos> To your father, to your mother, and now to you.
It is not survival I offer.<eos> It is your heart's desire.<eos> And what is my heart's desire?<eos> Vengeance.<eos> Justice.
Time for Plan B.<eos> - Which is?<eos> Give me your dagger and your water skin.<eos> - What?<eos> Why?
Together, behind the walls of Arborlon.<eos> I can't.<eos> This will stop the bleeding.<eos> It feels good.<eos> Mmm, real good.
Allman is the city's only chance.<eos> -What Are the beings here?<eos> -Gnomerna Is here that our allies.<eos> They have sworn allegiance to the king.<eos> -The True king.
It's over.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> - What?<eos> What's wrong? - We just gotta go quicker.<eos> Why? What the fuck?
Twelve years?<eos> Did you really find her like you said?<eos> Yes, I met her.<eos> And it was very unpleasant, but I didn't want to say.<eos> Unpleasant?
You have cheated.<eos> Now with Tom.<eos> - Come on.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Ready?
Don't ride like English lady.<eos> Ride like Mandinka warrior.<eos> I know what to do.<eos> Fancy white folk like to hear a real musician around Christmastime.<eos> Me.
We were just playing a stupid game.<eos> I can smell your breath.<eos> I know how hard it's been for you and I understand how you feel.<eos> But I need you to help me, Lina.<eos> For all of us.
You know why people say mean things, right?<eos> Why?<eos> Because they're scared.<eos> Makes me kind of feel sorry for them.<eos> How about you?
He's been short-listed for the Fields Prize four times.<eos> Not to mention he literally wrote the textbook he teaches from.<eos> Hey, can I come over tonight?<eos> No.<eos> Why?
Our Ada knows.<eos> She got smart about revolution.<eos> And she knows you have to get what you want your own way.<eos> Lizzie, I want it known, that money was for you because, some nights, it was you... .. who stopped my heart from breaking.<eos> No-one else.
What the hell do you care?<eos> The Polish Church interests you?<eos> I'm just asking.<eos> I hope they'll piss it off.<eos> And not just the Church, the people too.
No problem.<eos> Um... there's something off about him.<eos> No argument there.<eos> I don't trust him.<eos> Gabe?
Hey, Ed. How you doing?<eos> Oh, getting along just fine.<eos> Keeping busy.<eos> Any news on the Kringle front?<eos> Uh, no. Damn.
He dishonored our family name.<eos> Yes.<eos> Death to the Son of Gotham.<eos> Thank you for reminding me.<eos> Traitor.
Look, I've been here before.<eos> All you mad scientists say the same kind of stuff.<eos> I don't care.<eos> Let me go.<eos> Sorry, 13.
Five seconds! The board of directors.<eos> Incorrect.<eos> Oh, what a shame.<eos> The correct answer is...<eos> Sorry, fellas.
- You could go to prison, okay?<eos> - You're right. You're right.<eos> What am I thinking?<eos> Thank you for looking out for me...<eos> - Yeah. - Friend.
- Rosa coming in hot!<eos> - I'll also give you full control of my hair and wardrobe!<eos> I'll go on a date with you.<eos> Sold!<eos> To Jake, not to Scully.
He never works out of one place for long.<eos> I guarantee you he has drugs on him and if we don't get him now, we never will.<eos> Well, too bad for you, because Jake agrees with me.<eos> We're always on the same...<eos> - Page?
Yeah.<eos> Good idea, sir.<eos> Turns out your sensitive doctor isn't who he says he is. What?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Why?
Why can you not drink beer when Auntie Clare's in?<eos> Well, you can, but we don't, do we? - Because...<eos> - Why?<eos> She doesn't like it.<eos> Why?
- Oh my god, you're messing with me.<eos> - I think he was just like bleeding all over the sidewalk. - You're totally lying, you're totally lying to me.<eos> - No, I'm pretty sure that's what happened.<eos> - Wait, so he told you he liked me?<eos> - Who, Blake.
It will all be over soon enough anyways, right?<eos> - Give me the keys.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - Give me the keys, bitch.<eos> - Why?
What?<eos> You look fantastic.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Beautiful.<eos> You guys ready?
Come on.<eos> Why are you helping me?<eos> If I was sick, would you look after me?<eos> Yes.<eos> Why?
The thought of that coat kept me warm many a night.<eos> Today when everyone in the gallery were singing your praises I had tears in my eyes!<eos> Noor, my boy.<eos> We did it!<eos> We?
I'm always a negro, Even though I have papers.<eos> A nigger that you kick every night.<eos> Where is the difference?<eos> It's here!<eos> Here, here, here!
B-I-G, very big, big, big news.<eos> Wow.<eos> Please don't tell us we have another secret sibling.<eos> No!<eos> Ready?
She spent an hour with those kids, and now she wants to help them as much as I do.<eos> She also sees it as a chance to show her gratitude, for finally being given a child of our own.<eos> That totally makes sense.<eos> Yeah, I see it as a chance to show my gratitude for you.<eos> - For me? - Yeah.
Doing this cured me.<eos> I was really caught up, I was really lost.<eos> This truly is therapy.<eos> Now I'm happy, honestly.<eos> Thanks to them.
- Yeah. - Call it like it is. Right?<eos> - Call it quits. Yeah.<eos> - I get it. - Okay.<eos> - I feel good about that.<eos> - Me, too.
I just deleted it.<eos> How much later did you delete it?<eos> A week?<eos> - You didn't show it to anyone?<eos> - No, no one.
You know what?<eos> I can't accept this.<eos> It says "Property of Carol Schlitzman"<eos> on the bottom. Dang, man, I thought I scratched that off. (both laugh)<eos> Thanks, man, really.
From your husband?<eos> He knew the truth.<eos> You took my child away from me, and I am going to see to it that you pay for that every day for the rest of your life.<eos> I protected him from people like you.<eos> The blind.
Are you threatening me?<eos> People who come after me, they don't fare so well.<eos> You've seen enough to know.<eos> Very weird stuff happens around me.<eos> Not to me. Never to me.
Give it an hour at least.<eos> Get lost.<eos> Don't act like a roadie, bro!<eos> Balli...!<eos> Balli...!
Balli...!<eos> Give me the blood pressure set.<eos> Hurry!<eos> ls that what you do in college?<eos> Balli?
We will get you off any addiction.<eos> Cough syrup, smack or heroin... we have a solution...<eos> You can have it<eos> Give it to your mate<eos> To your family.
- Wait.<eos> Chetan, hold him.<eos> Balli, listen...<eos> Thorazine, quick!<eos> Balli?
The pursuit of military glory disgusts me now.<eos> And besides, Kutuzov was our last good man, and now the Tsar's demoted him.<eos> And what about yourself?<eos> You have so much to give.<eos> Marry again, why not?
That's not an opinion or a conspiracy theory.<eos> But...<eos> Bresson was opposed to all of it.<eos> Yes.<eos> Then why?
Of course, with my apologies.<eos> Something's up.<eos> Brass are wound up tight.<eos> - There's an investigation.<eos> - Into us?
I'm not really following.<eos> David. Remember? My son's dad.<eos> The one that did the midnight flit.<eos> It's just I'm working from home, so... Sorry.<eos> No.
That, I'll miss you.<eos> I'll miss you.<eos> Miss me how, exactly? Hm?<eos> My penis? My cooking?<eos> Your smile, in particular.
But tonight I started ta... ta feel like a man again.<eos> With another woman!<eos> Nothing happened.<eos> And it was actually you that made me believe it was possible in the first place.<eos> Me?
The British camp will be waking soon.<eos> Dougal MacKenzie...<eos> Do the honor.<eos> Ride ahead... and announce our presence to His Royal Highness,<eos> Prince Charles Edward Stuart.
That we exchange it.<eos> As much of it as possible.<eos> Find partners and trade coin forcommoditiesfareasier to move and to protect.<eos> If Nassau falls, we will have something to set aside to ensure our futures.<eos> "Our"?
Either I return the full cache and prove it or I fail, and in trying to excuse the shortfall, only aggravate their existing suspicion that I am part of the pirate problem, not its solution.<eos> And the dread fleet in Havana sets sail the very next day to raze all of Nassau to the ground.<eos> Then we'll fight them, defend the island.<eos> The odds would be dire, but we are not without resources.<eos> No, not "we."
Now.<eos> How many men?<eos> We imagine Rogers has 500 regulars at his disposal.<eos> What about militia?<eos> Conscripts?
Come on.<eos> Let me tell you, i had this kid the entire shift yesterday.<eos> He didn't strike me as a gunslinger.<eos> I don't trust rookies or cowboys.<eos> Or facebook or your husband.
You're all the same.<eos> Don't lump me in there with your husband, all right?<eos> That son of a bitch takes you for granted.<eos> And who's there for you, huh?<eos> Me.
You destroyed the surveillance necklace.<eos> - You haven't checked in.<eos> - I wore it as long as I could.<eos> Yeah? And what have you told him since?<eos> - Who?
You clear that up, maybe you go home.<eos> I... I sold the car, all right?<eos> Off the books.<eos> Well, why don't you give me an off-the-books name?<eos> Reggie.
I understand.<eos> Them pictures you found with your mother's bruises, um, that day we fought and she tripped down the stairs....<eos> I'll never forgive myself.<eos> I'm sorry, she... she tripped?<eos> Yeah. Why?
Then came me, Scotty F.<eos> Did we have another child?<eos> I forgot about that second baby.<eos> Oh, we had another child.<eos> Anyways, Big Cheese.
Why? I don't get it. You want the truth?<eos> Yes.<eos> He kind of reminds me of you.<eos> What?<eos> Me? Yes.
I got you.<eos> Come here. Come here.<eos> Oh, my God. It's okay.<eos> Honey, I'm so sorry it turned out this way.<eos> Me, too.
Is something going on I don't know about?<eos> I may have done something wrong.<eos> What are you keeping from me?<eos> When we saw Bobby and Veronica's baby, I told Ben that we were having trouble with our neighbor, and the police were not very helpful.<eos> Ben?
Honey!<eos> What is that?<eos> Flowers?<eos> - I can't believe you got me flowers.<eos> - Why?
Hey, where's the shotgun?<eos> Oh, it's in the trunk.<eos> It's safer that way.<eos> For who? The dirtbags rolling up on us?<eos> Unbelievable.
Feel better.<eos> Dr. Ziegler.<eos> Miss Weathers.<eos> Pleasure.<eos> Yes, absolutely.
I can imagine a hell of a lot right now. So, please.<eos> He works through a network of Wall Street traders.<eos> No one knows who they're working for. All they know is that they make trades and they win big every time.<eos> -They never lose.<eos> -Because of the disk.
We are not going to work with some deadbeat.<eos> Someone who pays the full price is a deadbeat and you're not?<eos> We didn't put us here. You did, your son.<eos> Look what he has done to all of us.<eos> To all of us.
Somebody had a reason to put it round his neck.<eos> - What do you think you're doing?<eos> - Living.<eos> Huh! Vishka, it's six years since your father died.<eos> Why now?
Vishka... I do want things.<eos> Like what?<eos> Another chance to plant your backside in the mud.<eos> Show a woman has no place holding a sword.<eos> A woman?
And what's in yours?<eos> Mmm. My wife... can cook.<eos> Try.<eos> Hey... we did a good job today.<eos> We?
I'm surprised you hadn't noticed.<eos> Inflammatory sepsis.<eos> Blood poisoning from the cuts.<eos> I dosed up on flucloxacillin when we arrived, but I'm pretty sure it's too late. - I'm sorry.<eos> - How sorry?
And Deva going behind your back feels like a betrayal?<eos> I just...<eos> I need to protect her.<eos> - From him?<eos> - From everything.
"They"?<eos> The government.<eos> Augustus worked for them.<eos> I couldn't trust anyone.<eos> Especially the police.
- She was about to come home!<eos> - Alex...<eos> - Why did you pull me out?<eos> - Alex!<eos> - Why?
- Ah. Our host.<eos> Jim Dawson, I'd like you to meet Deputy Chief Irving,<eos> - and his wife Connie.<eos> - Pleasure.<eos> - Pleasure.
Coming under these circumstances... tastes more like ashes than victory.<eos> I understand that.<eos> I'm going to make right on our son, with the full force and authority of this department, whatever it takes.<eos> If that brings you peace.<eos> Not you?
Vandal is immortal.<eos> Kendra and I reincarnate.<eos> Yeah, I've done that.<eos> And what the hell does this Randall guy got to do with us?<eos> Vandal.
How does a vessel of this size function without a crew?<eos> I don't need one. I have Gideon.<eos> Welcome aboard.<eos> I am Gideon, an interactive artificial consciousness programmed to operate this vessel's critical systems and aid Captain Hunter in his mission.<eos> Captain?
You're out in the middle of the night.<eos> The phone rings, and you're gone.<eos> Just please tell me.<eos> We work for our country...<eos> The Soviet Union.
Thank you very much.<eos> Thank you. - Well done.<eos> - Thank you. Appreciate it.<eos> Say thank you.<eos> Why?
Hold on a second!<eos> No, Jeannie!<eos> - There's mine. You got her.<eos> - Wait... - Here's a quick one for you.<eos> - No, rude.
Yeah, you broke a lot of shit at my place.<eos> Oh, my God, when you took me on that Foosball table with that little soccer man up my butt...<eos> Why can't you respect my boundaries!<eos> I just want to keep this between us.<eos> Why?
Did you say "Gob"?<eos> - What?<eos> - Yeah, she said "Gob."<eos> Whose side are you on?<eos> Justice.
'This incredible investment opportunity 'has complete government backing.<eos> 'Be part of the future, be part of the name, 'be part of... The Scimitar.'<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much.<eos> We want to thank you all for being here tonight, in particular our wonderful architect Paolo.<eos> And, of course, the Under-secretary of State, Charles Matherson.
What about Health and Safety?<eos> No, they've been told to wait.<eos> I want you to go down there and make a preliminary report.<eos> And take Sayyad with you.<eos> Why?
I hadn't seen that.<eos> Well, glad to help.<eos> Why are you really giving this to us, Uncle Peter?<eos> What is it that you want?<eos> Justice.
Terrible.<eos> A man of his standing and that young wife of his.<eos> Francis, are you joining us?<eos> Will I not be interrupting your council of war?<eos> Against whom?
A man of his standing and that young wife of his.<eos> Francis, are you joining us?<eos> Will I not be interrupting your council of war?<eos> Against whom?<eos> My cousin?
The Upside Down.<eos> Down. Yeah.<eos> And my friend Barbara? Can you find her, too?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> What?
- Did he buy it?<eos> He almost had a heart attack.<eos> That's great!<eos> Yeah, if we scare him enough... - he'll talk.<eos> Yeah. But who to?
Devon.<eos> And I'm a little bit biased.<eos> She and Nico did a play together downtown.<eos> Can you introduce me to Andy?<eos> - Griffith?
Holy shit!<eos> What?<eos> Skip Hadderly's office. This is Christine Reade.<eos> I need to see you in my office right now.<eos> - Why?
Check the citations and... double-check the data.<eos> Okay.<eos> You know, if you wanna... If you wanna go home, and take the rest of the day off, it's...<eos> It's fine.<eos> Why?
It's okay.<eos> - You can tell me, it's all right.<eos> Okay...<eos> She-she wanted access to your files.<eos> Why?
- What the fuck is wrong with you, man?<eos> Chill, man. Chill.<eos> You hear it first.<eos> Sleep tight. Shit right.<eos> #Oorah.
I'm all for saving lives and kicking ass and stuff, but... come on, man, they got an army out there.<eos> The Royal Guard ops arrived.<eos> Mohammed.<eos> Thank you, Jesus.<eos> Yeah, Mohammed, too.
I'm happy to meet the guy. But unless I'm meeting with the main guy, they come here to me!<eos> I don't go to them.<eos> As it happens, here's my next meeting.<eos> Stan, para fuera.<eos> My man.
I think I'm an idiot.<eos> He was my only chance, and look at him.<eos> And, Regina, how did you even know how to do all that back there?<eos> My mom used to do that for my dad.<eos> -I'm sorry.
- Was the dinner to your liking?<eos> - It was yummy.<eos> We've had a minor setback though.<eos> Some ill-intentioned folks, probably Romanians or Africans, have stolen our purses with all our money, ID, and credit cards...<eos> Everything.
Don't move her, she banged her head!<eos> - Call an ambulance.<eos> - Hold on.<eos> - How are you?<eos> - No ambulance.
!<eos> - Don't move.<eos> - Take it easy.<eos> - Don't move.<eos> - No ambulance.
She could stab a guy and give nine handles at the same time.<eos> - That's one perspective.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> You know who would love this?<eos> Hector and Dorff.
And you.<eos> Hello.<eos> Nice to meet you, Sebastian.<eos> - Have a nice dinner.<eos> - You too.
Wish me luck.<eos> Mwah! Good luck.<eos> Hey, excuse me.<eos> Will you spray us, please?<eos> Oh, me too.
Let's do this.<eos> Uh, Kelsey, did you get my email about the dresses?<eos> Yes.<eos> I am not wearing a see-through wedding dress.<eos> Why?
Someone has been using our hosts to smuggle data out of the park.<eos> Now, this... this I could get used to.<eos> You're not gonna indulge?<eos> My flesh has tasted a greater pleasure than any offered in here...<eos> War.
Our mystery one-legged man.<eos> Hoggard and... what was the black fella called?<eos> Arthur Solomon.<eos> He the one with the sock shoved down his throat or the other one?<eos> Other one.
You go and throw me a surprise party, Joe Don?<eos> Pink Lady.<eos> I knew your little swish-ass would love that piece.<eos> Ruinin' a business relationship and all for this kind of money?<eos> Why?
- Um... Back to camp.<eos> We have to go.<eos> They said.<eos> Wait.<eos> Why?
They said.<eos> Wait.<eos> Why?<eos> - Because we're prisoners? - Damn it.<eos> Hey! But why?
Can she please have her veil back?<eos> No, it's still an infraction.<eos> So it sounds like the lake was really fun, huh?<eos> Well, actually... I'm not sure how clean that water was... 'cause I'm starting to get a gnarly itch on my thighs.<eos> Me too.
I was supposed to transplant the sunflowers today.<eos> I'll keep these as a thank-you.<eos> You gotta start cutting along the joint line, and whatever you do, don't puncture the intestines.<eos> That's it for the toast.<eos> Sorry, people.
Preston Hall.<eos> You roomed with Damien Thorn.<eos> We shared the same dorm.<eos> Something happened to him?<eos> Not to him.
No, not for like 10 years.<eos> Your beige windbreaker is really lighting' up my board.<eos> Oh, uh, thanks.<eos> Do you know what I mean?<eos> My vagina.
Well, I don't see why not.<eos> I can't.<eos> I mean, I have to iron Kent's underwear.<eos> What?<eos> Why?
I don't know where to start.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I'm actually really, really good. Yeah.<eos> I'm glad I ran into you. This is really nice.<eos> Yeah, me too.
Really, thank you very much.<eos> Did you tell him what we talked about?<eos> Not yet.<eos> Rondelay and American Century, you're gonna share office space. (COUGHS)<eos> Why?
Just explain to them what I'm trying to do.<eos> I'm Jarrod Slade.<eos> I'm very sorry for your loss.<eos> Your uncle was a fine man.<eos> - Sorry for your loss.
I have full confidence.<eos> Oh, this is my husband.<eos> Jarrod Slade.<eos> - Pleased to meet you.<eos> - And you.
Didn't do much good this year.<eos> Got passed over for promotion.<eos> College wasn't what I thought it was gonna be.<eos> I look at Aria, Spencer and even Hanna it all seemed to click for them.<eos> - Not for you?
I bet I'll get some roses tomorrow.<eos> Not only did I not get flowers, my husband's marrying another woman.<eos> It's just been so long since I've been in love for real.<eos> I kinda miss it.<eos> Me, too.
If you want to keep Cosmo out of trouble, you gotta lie.<eos> I've never told a lie in my life.<eos> Oh, it's easy.<eos> How was your day today?<eos> Not so good.
Nailed it!<eos> Alright, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Ramona's epic 13th birthday party!<eos> We've paid off the cops. We've warned the neighbors.<eos> The only thing left is to ask you guys the most important question:<eos> y'all ready for this?
That's all I have prepared.<eos> Thank you, gentlemen.<eos> It's now time for D.J. to hand out the final rose.<eos> Good luck, man.<eos> You, too, bro.
But... should I be afraid of him?<eos> No<eos> But the phones? You remember who you sold them to?<eos> - Yeah. The old guy in the wheelchair<eos> - Rögnvaldur
But the phones? You remember who you sold them to?<eos> - Yeah. The old guy in the wheelchair<eos> - Rögnvaldur<eos> And Guðni, from the hotel<eos> Anyone else?
Looks like we're gonna need to add another performance.<eos> So, you get to change the world after all.<eos> The world?<eos> I'll settle for that dance space.<eos> Me, too.
Because if it isn't...<eos> She locked us in here on purpose.<eos> Do you think we should call for backup?<eos> The detectives have 28 people to help. No need to panic yet.<eos> Oh, thank goodness.
Uh, information on his brother, about how he died.<eos> Died?<eos> What happened to him?<eos> So we done here?<eos> Unbelievable.
Hey, it never is.<eos> That's the curse of what we do, and why we never stop.<eos> I'm not giving up on Krupa.<eos> She's not alone among the missing.<eos> Thanks, Detective.
We need to get back to Harold and the Machine.<eos> I can't do this anymore.<eos> I don't know who's controlling this.<eos> Controlling what, sweetie?<eos> Me.
Detective Fusco here's been working with us to infiltrate this domestic terrorist ring.<eos> Homeland Security running a joint operation with NYPD?<eos> - How do you explain that one?<eos> - I don't.<eos> Not to you, anyway.
I'm here.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I'm here... yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> Thanks to you.
- Yeah, of course I know YouTube.<eos> What...<eos> Well, what makes you think that?<eos> Okay, I sent you an email with a link.<eos> Nance?
Prairie, here's the thing. The process can sometimes help people to heal.<eos> Storytelling is cleansing.<eos> But I also want to make sure you control the narrative. That you profit from it.<eos> And did it heal them?<eos> All the money?
But the plan worked the next time, right?<eos> I mean, you could just pretend to be zombies?<eos> It took us nearly a year to get that part right.<eos> A year?<eos> Why?
Do you get the plan?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I say they're touching my dick and you come and get me.<eos> - Oh, don't say it like that.<eos> - What? Why?
Don't fucking touch me, bitch.<eos> You saw me do some fucking flips and thought, "This guy"?<eos> No.<eos> What?<eos> Why?
We're going to do something big!<eos> Let's do it then!<eos> An entire Eighth Route Army couldn't do it.<eos> Can people like us do it? Him?<eos> Him? And Me?
Fan Chuan.<eos> Look what we found!<eos> Quick! Give me!<eos> Brother, the boiler is leaking.<eos> Dakui.
The girls came in to tell me that Carter texted back.<eos> Told you he would.<eos> Remember, two forms of birth control, right, Mom and Dad?<eos> I feel very uncomfortable in this conversation.<eos> Why?
- No.<eos> - No contact at all?<eos> I mean, I left her some messages, but she never called me back. You didn't bother to check up on her?<eos> - Christian...<eos> - Like a good agent?
- Thanks.<eos> - You won't speak to Lila.<eos> You get on your horse, you leave Herot, and you never come back.<eos> Am I clear?<eos> - Beowulf...
Why, yes, you do, sir.<eos> ♪ But it can't compete... ♪ Right.<eos> I'm gonna leave that for you. Party favor.<eos> Dev, we got to run.<eos> - Why?
I'm not paying my wife $700 a pop.<eos> - Christ, Lorna... - Mm-hmm.<eos> Okay, for 700 bucks, I could get a fantastic professional whore.<eos> Great, well, I'm not doing it for 200 anymore.<eos> Why not?
He sold some Panther AR-15s to some militia guys, but it had nothing to do with Alicia.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Are you sure he said Panther AR-15s?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why?
Hey.<eos> Good trip?<eos> Whatever you did to Garth Sykes gentled him down real good.<eos> He e-mailed, said he's ready to soar with you, whatever the fuck that means.<eos> Sorry. Sorry.
Jack, you know Hugh Jones.<eos> Oh, sure.<eos> He came to my New York office last year, ruffling feathers.<eos> You tell him about that girl?<eos> What girl?
♪ Speed it onward ♪ ♪ Loud her praises tell ♪ ♪ Hail to thee, our Alma mater ♪<eos> Hey! Get out the road, you drunks!<eos> Why won't you tell me how you broke your hand?<eos> M-maybe 'cause I did it taking down a high...<eos> Level Russian operative.
If the bomb goes off, you'll be dead, too.<eos> We're out of time.<eos> Samberly will get this working.<eos> - I-it's not working.<eos> - Why the hell not?
Uh, next size up is 37.<eos> Is it for specific space?<eos> It's to impress a woman.<eos> Not... not that woman.<eos> A woman.
- What a waste of time, then.<eos> You owe Martha gas money.<eos> Make sure she pays you gas money.<eos> Why can't you be more like your sister?<eos> Unbelievable.
I think so.<eos> - Cheers. - Cheers.<eos> You know what? I don't care what Yelp says.<eos> I'm liking this place.<eos> Yeah, me, too.
Yeah. No.<eos> Totally. Yeah, like 9/11.<eos> - You're... you're a truther, too? - Oh, yeah.<eos> I mean, any intelligent person can see the government was in on it.<eos> Why? Oil.
What did I ever do to deserve you, hmm?<eos> I know.<eos> Like we always do.<eos> Sir, you can't give her those.<eos> Why not?
What the fuck was that?<eos> Well, you were driving and then suddenly you just swerved...<eos> No, what the fuck were you doing?<eos> - That? I was trying to blow you.<eos> - Why?
You know, my proverbial outfit.<eos> Um, I'm not sure I follow.<eos> Principal Toby, this has been a really, really amazing opportunity for me.<eos> You've taken a lot of chances on me, and I'm sure you've taken a lot of flak, which is why I'm gonna seem like a real wench when I say that I don't think I'll be coming back next year.<eos> Oh, gosh, I... why?
Tally, hey.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> This is so crazy.<eos> I was literally just thinking about you.<eos> Um, why?
I'm finally marrying your father.<eos> Yeah, but does it not bother you at all that he just... he shoved that guy and broke his camera last night?<eos> No, actually what bothered me was all those people coming at us like that, invading our privacy... I mean, that was scary.<eos> Okay, but you didn't freak out, Aunt Tandy didn't freak out, only Deacon freaked out.<eos> "Deacon"?
- Uh, yeah.<eos> It is, yeah. - Oh.<eos> Thanks.<eos> They, uh, always seem to go missing.<eos> Oh, same here.
And you have made beautiful music out of a really unfortunate circumstance.<eos> Isn't that amazing?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Music kind of saved my life.<eos> Mine too.
I'm, uh... I'm not sure.<eos> It's a lot to process, you know?<eos> I feel relieved, scared, a little resentful, too.<eos> I just can't help feeling like Juliette destroyed the life that I thought I would have.<eos> Me too.
Probably... for Will.<eos> He's got nothing to lose.<eos> Unlike you.<eos> It's so hot in here.<eos> You hot?
Well, I can keep calling, But I've talked to every active tour out there.<eos> Maybe we need to think outside the box a little bit.<eos> I mean, we do know an artist who has a very devoted fan base.<eos> Who's that?<eos> Me.
Are you okay, little buddy, are you having a nightmare?<eos> Yeah, I just keep having this... same dream over and over about these dickweeds that are picking on me.<eos> You used to get bullied, huh?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Those cocksuckers!
One night, he was totally out of it and told me where he keeps his cash.<eos> One hundred thousand Euros, always in his flat.<eos> You're gonna get it for me.<eos> How?<eos> With your heels.
All right. If you're having one.<eos> Still here?<eos> Thought you were just visiting.<eos> You've looked better.<eos> Same to you.
How could Kane do this?<eos> It wasn't Kane.<eos> It was Pike.<eos> How did you escape?<eos> Bellamy.
Should've stuck with key.<eos> Would you mind if I run some trials on it?<eos> I just want to make sure that there aren't any side effects.<eos> Would you have given it to Wells without testing it first?<eos> Wells?
I think she speaks the truth.<eos> If you don't help me...<eos> Rheda, when others doubted your becoming Thane, I spoke out for you.<eos> I would never lie.<eos> Not to you.
That's Hrothgar's blade, isn't it?<eos> He gave it to you?<eos> I had to take it out of his dead hands.<eos> He may have made Rheda Thane, but who else could he give that to?<eos> Beowulf.
Wake up!<eos> Not so scary in your cage now.<eos> Give us a show.<eos> What do you think I am?<eos> A freak?
- Let me just... Okay. - Okay.<eos> There's a high school around the block.<eos> Marching band practice.<eos> I like it.<eos> Me, too.
Okay, well, relax.<eos> I got this handled. It's all good, it's all good.<eos> Yeah. Hey, Wyatt.<eos> Hey, man. How are things in the old writers' room?<eos> Great, man.
I've got it from here.<eos> I'm supposed to stay with you.<eos> My possessions are very personal.<eos> -I'd like privacy, please.<eos> -I'm sorry.
-Fuck you.<eos> -Language.<eos> I didn't know we were at fucking Sunday school, you old fucking prune.<eos> Listen, you may be gangsters, but at least you can show some common decency.<eos> Gangsters?
- I understand.<eos> - End of the film!<eos> We can't just give the speech to some...<eos> Some<eos> Roman schmo!
He knows how to make a quality picture.<eos> That is true.<eos> He will not quit on a take until it has quality.<eos> That them?<eos> Sorry, sir, no.
Well, I don't see why not.<eos> Nothing in the California statute - prohibits adoption by one's own parent. - Mmm-hmm.<eos> This is new ground.<eos> Technically, she'd have to give up the baby to a third party.<eos> Joe Silverman.
Why is he a snow man?<eos> Uh, because he's a man and he's made of snow.<eos> You know, you could make him a snow woman.<eos> But I don't want to.<eos> Why?
Let's go.<eos> Fuck this.<eos> We got about three minutes tops to grab the most expensive shit you can carry, all right?<eos> For fuck's sakes!<eos> You guys ready?
Rosalee'll help you get her to the train.<eos> Now, there's a water tower on the edge of the city I seen.<eos> You can't miss it.<eos> We go there, we meet there.<eos> All right?
- Daddy?<eos> - Help...<eos> - Daddy?<eos> So you made it.<eos> - And you, you too.
Now, replacing a tile is a simple task.<eos> As long as the substrate beneath the tile isn't rotted.<eos> If there is rot in your substrate, we will now play loud music so you can curse.<eos> Stupid floor!<eos> Why...
So, do you, uh, find me attractive?<eos> Sorry, but no.<eos> Oh, curse the luck!<eos> And this is an android that I programmed to say nothing but "yes."<eos> Why?
Sorry, but no.<eos> Oh, curse the luck!<eos> And this is an android that I programmed to say nothing but "yes."<eos> Why?<eos> Why?
Oh, curse the luck!<eos> And this is an android that I programmed to say nothing but "yes."<eos> Why?<eos> Why?<eos> Why?
We're still stuck with that.<eos> No, we ain't.<eos> I should've killed them.<eos> The ones that took you and Maggie... what'd they do to you?<eos> To us?
Believe me, I didn't want to.<eos> Why'd you quit football? What?<eos> Was it 'cause you broke your arm?<eos> No, I just stopped playing during college.<eos> Why?
I am throwing on some veggie burgers.<eos> Thanks for having us.<eos> - Hi!<eos> - Hey, hey, I'm Nate.<eos> - Madeline.
That's the world I see.<eos> That's what keeps me strong.<eos> That's the nation we can build... together.<eos> If you take millions of white people, and flood every country in Africa with them, what do they call that?<eos> Genocide.
He hasn't been sleeping.<eos> Well.<eos> Can you blame him?<eos> Paul was everything to us.<eos> Nearly everything.
My daddy's in heaven and my mom is...<eos> Morgan, there you are.<eos> Baby, how many times have I told you to stay where I can see you?<eos> But I was helping Mr...<eos> Mr. Case.
It's what makes you great.<eos> But today, your own words, you missed something.<eos> Somehow the idea that all the guys...<eos> I asked Mafee, and the moment he said that everyone else agreed that it was the wrong move, I had to stick it out, had to prove that I was the difference maker.<eos> To who?

- So did I.<eos> Queen Kwenthrith.<eos> Thank God, you are free.<eos> I do thank our Lord, King Ecbert.<eos> But also your son, Aethelwulf.
He even wants to release it through his production company.<eos> Pete Easterman?<eos> The Windjammer himself.<eos> -Ah, mm... This is a bad idea.<eos> -Why?
Yeah, bye, Richard. Nice to see you.<eos> -He's a very confused man.<eos> -Yeah, tell me about it.<eos> He didn't even know about Jasmine.<eos> -Your daughter?
A vaccine against terrigenesis.<eos> Potentially.<eos> It can't reverse the effects once someone's transformed,<eos> This could virtually put an end to...<eos> To us?
A good coat of paint...<eos> Inmate labor is free.<eos> This is a brilliant idea, Joe, really.<eos> - Thanks to you, Linda.<eos> - No, thanks to you.
Shit.<eos> Capicúa, bitches.<eos> What I tell you?<eos> I'm unbeatable. I'm sorry, man.<eos> Shit!
Aw, don't tell me you're still upset about our photo.<eos> If there's nothing else...<eos> Then I guess I'll have to play the Nicky card.<eos> You're going to call Sir Nicholas Hampstead, the head of Scotland Yard, because I won't facilitate a juvenile wager?<eos> Why?
I was wrong about you.<eos> It's not that you think too much of yourself.<eos> It's that you think too little.<eos> You're afraid that if there's something more, you won't be worthy of it.<eos> Why?
You can do it by yourself, you don't need me.<eos> That's rubbish.<eos> You need someone there, someone who knows the procedure.<eos> Who told you that, Michael Stotes?<eos> You girls, you stupid, little posh girls.
I didn't even know you guys existed until yesterday!<eos> Is anyone there?<eos> If your goal was to scare the crap out of me, mission accomplished!<eos> And as far as I'm concerned... you can have it out with those Shadowhunters.<eos> Especially, the blonde one.
We're in the belly of the beast.<eos> We'll call you when we land.<eos> 3x13 - "Parting Shot"<eos> _<eos> Incroyable.
So, people from the island, they call him and tell him where the junk is.<eos> He goes, he picks it up, sells it as scrap metal.<eos> - He was just doing his job.<eos> - So why'd he run?<eos> Why?
See, maybe you can find something useful in this.<eos> Thank you. Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It's fixed.<eos> Thanks to this this pen and this wire.
Till then we'll be sitting idle.<eos> With our hands in our pockets.<eos> And now you want the kidnapper to do your job for you.. ..he has made a fool out of all of you.<eos> Shame on you.<eos> Extremely sorry, sir, but we..
Well, actually, I think it's a pretty straight line, Matt.<eos> Daredevil practiced vigilante justice in our backyard and we applauded him for it.<eos> I know that I did.<eos> And we never stopped to think that maybe... his actions could open the door for men like this.<eos> Men... men with guns.
We care about you.<eos> You're worth keeping around.<eos> How far away was this guy when he hit you?<eos> Four or five feet.<eos> Why?
I need to connect directly to the voters, the African American voters.<eos> Mr. President, I've got the Secretary of State.<eos> I'll call her back.<eos> Hang on, boys.<eos> Meechum?
No, something is missing.<eos> Hmm, Bart's right.<eos> They're not as good as the eggs we stole from Flanders.<eos> The eggs... we stole...<eos> from Flanders!
You can...<eos> She can have Flag Day, Groundhog Day, any of those days, Father's Day.<eos> Well, I was just asking.<eos> Yeah, I know, and you did.<eos> Unbelievable.
You're not allowed to speak to us without me brief.<eos> Hey, it's not you I want.<eos> No, it's Steve.<eos> I need to talk to you again about the night your dad died.<eos> - Why?
I-I just need - to keep the customers I got.<eos> Now, take it.<eos> Daisy, help.<eos> Save me, please.<eos> So sorry.
Look, I've dedicated my life, surrendered my life to a higher power.<eos> That's the word power.<eos> And that's what you seek -- not wealth or control or clout -- no, true power.<eos> How does that sound?<eos> Intriguing.
They'll be fine.<eos> - How are you doing?<eos> - I'm holding up, I guess.<eos> I'm glad everyone could make it...<eos> Except for Aria.
I only succeeded where they failed.<eos> They did not foresee the peril to our nomadic way of life.<eos> What peril?<eos> Are you not still a nomad living in a fucking ger?<eos> Empress.
We don't secure valuables worth less than $10 million.<eos> Well, I'm sure this will suffice.<eos> Doubloons from the wreck of the "Esplinade".<eos> They've been appraised at $10 million dollars... apiece.<eos> Such a pleasure.
- We'll send the crew home right now... - No, we are not pushing dick.<eos> We are going and getting our suitor.<eos> Get in the car.<eos> Get back to work. Stop standing around. Oh, my God.<eos> Unbelievable.
I don't think he did.<eos> I think he was keeping it for someone who could afford it.<eos> That vial of musk taken from the animal research centre, that's somehow part of it.<eos> All of it, I think.<eos> Man-eater.
Uh, do you live here alone?<eos> Well, I had a hamster but I'm out of town all the time, so he...<eos> Were you here the night that<eos> Charlotte DiLaurentis was killed?<eos> Why?
- Hi.<eos> I just wanted to give you a quick update.<eos> Um, Jillian said if she doesn't have something from Fitz by tomorrow, she's moving on.<eos> What?<eos> Why?
You are not asking me to change your grade you are asking me to confess to a murder.<eos> Where did you go that night after you left Aria?<eos> Why the hell can't you tell us?<eos> - Emily, leave him alone.<eos> - Why?
70 grand.<eos> I need you to, erm, look after it for a while.<eos> - Who does it belong to, Harry?<eos> - It's in transition.<eos> - From you to...?
Harry goes into all this.<eos> I know what Kaleem looks like.<eos> Him.<eos> That's right.<eos> Why?
Get a move on!<eos> Who told you that?<eos> You're lucky bracelet?<eos> It hasn't been very lucky for me, has it?<eos> Or Barbara?
And there will be no more of this, do you understand?<eos> No more, Mathilda.<eos> I do not write the law in this goddamned country, Caitlin.<eos> Neither am I a judge, both of which resolved that in the absence of a corpse, seven years must pass before your father be declared dead and his worldly goods handed to his surviving heir,<eos> our son.
You speak for the people on this matter of the Huskarla training?<eos> - I do.<eos> - When do we start?<eos> - We don't.<eos> - Why?
Just like me, you haven't aged a day.<eos> I have a good hairdresser.<eos> In my long life,<eos> I have met some of the most skilled interrogators in history, but since we are in the Soviet Union, let me tell you a story about a friend of mine...<eos> Joseph Stalin.
It's okay.<eos> Get up.<eos> Behind the tape, please.<eos> Is he okay?<eos> Him?
They call it hydrotherapy.<eos> I need the blanket.<eos> What?<eos> Hand me the blanket, Miss.<eos> Why?
I'm sorry.<eos> You're sorry?<eos> You're sorry?<eos> - My family's not okay with it. - Your folks?<eos> Your, uh, your parents?
No.<eos> Doo, doo. Cut it out.<eos> Remember this day, boys.<eos> Today be the day guarantees our very survival.<eos> In your name and honor, fa.
And you will help me in this.<eos> And if I am unable to assist you?<eos> What would you do to someone who came between you and your child?<eos> You're okay?<eos> Thanks to you.
Lydia, you will.<eos> Just try to find some way to remember me, okay?<eos> Remember how you were the first girl I ever danced with?<eos> Or how I had a crush on you freshman year.<eos> Sophomore year?
Yes, of course I can.<eos> Are you maintaining a journal? Yeah, it's supposed to help me<eos> "define and sort through my trauma," but seeing as how every day I was down there was the same as the one before, it makes for a pretty boring read.<eos> And... to answer the question that you are thinking, but not asking directly... I'm fine.<eos> And thanks to you,
Um... your voice.<eos> Used to read stories to me, sing songs.<eos> I loved that voice.<eos> And I'm sorry you haven't heard it in a while.<eos> Me, too.
It's good.<eos> Uh... how much of that did you hear?<eos> Uh, enough.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Sorry too.
Not entirely.<eos> But you get a little bit by forgiving yourself.<eos> And since that's not always the easiest thing in the world to do, then maybe you start by forgiving someone else.<eos> Someone who probably really needs it.<eos> Someone like Scott.
Where would I even start?<eos> "Sorry for trying to kill you"?<eos> I feel like I lost something.<eos> Then maybe you start by forgiving someone else.<eos> Someone like Scott.
What if we call in a bomb threat?<eos> You remember the bomb threat at the airport three weeks ago?<eos> Yeah, of course I do.<eos> I see your point.<eos> Set...
All for you...<eos> What did you do with it, Marcel?<eos> Where is the pike?<eos> The Argents...<eos> The Argents...
Bet she's a real peach, and, yes, Henry, I have a girl.<eos> She's in a sleeping beauty spell.<eos> Long story.<eos> So here's what I'm thinking.<eos> Why today?
You can barely contain your own darkness.<eos> It is better I die as someone I'm proud of than live as someone I despise.<eos> No! It's better a flawed life lived than wasted rotting in clay!<eos> It's not gonna happen,<eos> Not to you.
Oh, brother, you came for me.<eos> Always.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Aurora, what have you done to us?<eos> Je chèch je yo. Not to us.
Always.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Aurora, what have you done to us?<eos> Je chèch je yo. Not to us.<eos> Aurora. To you.
Oh, these are gonna come in really handy.<eos> Why am I doing everything you say?<eos> This is crazy... breaking and entering, grand larceny.<eos> You're doing it because I asked you so nicely.<eos> - But why...
Sorry to break it to you, luv.<eos> It's a fake.<eos> Looks like someone's trying to put one over on you.<eos> You're lying.<eos> Why?
Thank goodness.<eos> I've been looking for that everywhere.<eos> I'll just tell Yvonne the restaurant found this.<eos> - I'll keep you out of it.<eos> - Why?
About Yvonne.<eos> Okay, Caleb and I had nothing to do with it.<eos> How do I know that you didn't do it?<eos> I mean, accusing other people of something that you've done that does have kind of a vintage Mona quality about it.<eos> Unbelievable.
My anger management issues, they are less manageable than I thought.<eos> Look, I called what's going on with you anger management because I don't know what else to call it.<eos> All I know is that there's something that's really bothering you and if I know what it is, maybe I can help.<eos> You can't.<eos> This...
Anything else requires commitment.<eos> Well, I'm here now, and I want us to speak openly.<eos> I'll answer any questions you have.<eos> Ok. I just have one at the moment.<eos> Why now?
Bender.<eos> Whatever he wants to call himself.<eos> I told him where chief Reynolds was staying.<eos> The next day, the place blows up.<eos> Objection.
And 3 days later, the city leadership were all dead.<eos> You did all of these things for the defendant?<eos> The defendant and the organization he works for.<eos> He called it hive.<eos> Objection.
I realized it could wait.<eos> You've been pushing us pretty hard, and I know why.<eos> Oliver, it's ok to miss Felicity.<eos> I--i appreciate what you're doing, but I don't think that you're the-- person to help you through it?<eos> Why?
Well, doesn't hurt having someone controlling the city's infrastructure.<eos> Can't find any public blueprints on file for an underground lair with a creepy sewer entrance.<eos> Believe me...<eos> There are no public blueprints for this.<eos> Unbelievable.
He named after you?<eos> No.<eos> I suspect I'm named after him.<eos> You like that one?<eos> Me, too.
Wh-Why do you care so much about what I think?<eos> Well, think about it.<eos> You've been more of a father figure to me than the fat man ever has been or ever will be.<eos> Look, I know I'm always busting your balls, but it's just because you're the only person in this house whose judgment actually matters to me. Wow.<eos> Thanks, Stewie.
Oh, it's a blast.<eos> There's the thrill of the game, people bring snacks, plus you'll hear some pretty unfiltered opinions about those jokers in Washington.<eos> Yeah, that sounds perfectly terrible.<eos> You know what, Joe? Peter would love to go with you.<eos> What? !
Sure you would.<eos> What did you promise him?<eos> Supplies?<eos> This place?<eos> Me?
You'll start looking like Keith Richards.<eos> Yeah, Keith Richards.<eos> Well, I wouldn't have to squint if you'd just scoot over so I could sit in the shade.<eos> Oh, we'd be perfectly willing to scoot over, but then people might think you're in the clique.<eos> Yeah, the clique.
You have a problem with that?<eos> No, not at all.<eos> You just don't look the part.<eos> What's a cop supposed to look like?<eos> Not as hot as you.
Whoever gets the headless match, he'll do it.<eos> Agreed? - - -<eos> Good.- - -<eos> Sparen must be exonerated.<eos> - Why so? - - -
- Thanks.<eos> I'll drive you.<eos> How you feel?<eos> - Fine... and you?<eos> Fine.
I don't care!<eos> The pumps have been off for 11 secondsNwithout a reason...<eos> Justina!<eos> I'll call you back.<eos> Walkie-talkie.
If we want to get him...<eos> We need to target his weaknesses.<eos> Sadly, very few come to mind.<eos> I can think of one.<eos> Me.
What was it called?<eos> A real funny name...<eos> You remember this, don't you?<eos> You got it in your hair; Mom had to cut it out.<eos> Sorry, no.
That's the deal.<eos> Truth bomb if ever I heard one.<eos> Okay. Oh, I do that very well, don't I?<eos> I'm sorry, but this does not work for me.<eos> Me neither.
And, oh, my God, can they cook.<eos> Hey, man. It's Kev and V.<eos> Yeah, I'm paralyzed, not blind.<eos> Look, we just wanted to say how, uh, really sorry we are for what happened to you.<eos> Really, really, really sorry.
Stood there.<eos> Abrecan, there's something you should see.<eos> Alone.<eos> - So, where does Slean's loyalties lie?<eos> - With your sister.
Things would have gone a lot easier for me if I had.<eos> A ship leaves for the Farlands on the next tide.<eos> Give me what I want and you will sail with it.<eos> Refuse...<eos> Beowulf, no!
- We take the bridge.<eos> - We take the bridge.<eos> Get the dogs.<eos> He should learn some manners.<eos> Why?
No. No. No.<eos> Let him die with his people.<eos> The Varni!<eos> Wulfings to the main gate!<eos> Ready?
Yeah?<eos> Where are the kids?<eos> They're safe. They're upstairs.<eos> He's hasn't touched the gun, he's not threatening anyone.<eos> What about himself?
Buh-bye.<eos> No, you have a great day, Spencer.<eos> And can I just say what a pleasure it has been to work with such an absolute professional.<eos> I'm gonna give you a five star Yelp review right this second.<eos> OK, you too.
What about you?<eos> Parents are gone.<eos> Cancer.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Yeah, me, too.
And 45 others just like it.<eos> Although Graham is now just a co-owner... with me.<eos> You are now looking at the proud new co-owner of every Weatherby hotel in the country.<eos> And I have you to thank...<eos> Me?
I'm sorry.<eos> Did you just agree to marry me?<eos> I think I did.<eos> He took everything from us.<eos> From you.
So he figured if he tanked the trial, he could start over.<eos> Give her a fighting chance.<eos> By poisoning the rest of us?<eos> The good news is, you have a case.<eos> Thanks to you.
Mickey Shive was waiting for me.<eos> What do you think they're gonna do with it?<eos> Sell it, of course.<eos> Same as me.<eos> To whom?
You know where they're hiding me?<eos> - Iowa. - Oh.<eos> I give them you, and I get the beach house in Charleston.<eos> You know who they give the beach house in Charleston to?<eos> - Nobody.
A receipt?<eos> For what?<eos> Do i really need to sit here And punk you?<eos> I got her a gift.<eos> Who?
Who told...<eos> Who told you all these things?<eos> You put on airs as a politician,<eos> You still haven't figured out you've run up against a politician far cannier than you.<eos> Me.
I'm sure it was explained at the time of admittance.<eos> No, it wasn't.<eos> I... I didn't...<eos> Um, could you please get a message to my son,<eos> Norman Bates?
I know we haven't talked in a while.<eos> Maybe you only trust me about as much as I trust you right now, but I'm gonna ask you to have hope for me anyway.<eos> Just, please, have hope.<eos> I'm gonna take a selfie. I'm gonna take a selfie.<eos> You guys ready?
- Yes, you're on speaker.<eos> - You can't tell her.<eos> - Turn it off.<eos> - I can't.<eos> - Why not ?
- No, tell me.<eos> You embarrassed me today when you gave me those condoms.<eos> I didn't know where to look.<eos> I didn't tell you to use them.<eos> Why then ?
- I didn't like the idea.<eos> No, you insisted on not playing.<eos> Got something to hide ?<eos> No.<eos> Why then ?
Even if I do you this favor.<eos> Favor? Who?<eos> To whom?<eos> You to me?<eos> To us?
Yeah. No wonder why We're not getting anywhere. Hey.<eos> Only place we're getting Is to jail. That's the only place We're getting.<eos> Busting his window out, Raising hell, why do you think That's gonna get us?<eos> - we're sending a message!<eos> - to the wrong people!
- on your mark! - on your mark!<eos> - get set! - get set.<eos> Hold on. Stop, stop.<eos> Foster, foster.<eos> Criminals.
Nothing!<eos> Aneta, open up!<eos> - Come out, now!<eos> - I'm not coming out.<eos> - Why not?
We still fighting?<eos> You tell me.<eos> I hope not.<eos> How was your day?<eos> Fine. Yours?
Shall I bring the dress?<eos> Of course.<eos> This chapel is very pretty.<eos> I think she'll like it.<eos> Uh, who?
Of course.<eos> This chapel is very pretty.<eos> I think she'll like it.<eos> Uh, who?<eos> My mother.
This is great.<eos> And not only did Magnus not get the girl her memories back, he took the necklace.<eos> This is fantastic...<eos> Alec, the girl... her name is Clary and I highly suggest you keep your voice down.<eos> Why?
Tell me what you need me to do.<eos> Tell me what?<eos> What's so important that Luke risked his life?<eos> Everything Jocelyn hoped to hide from you.<eos> Why?
Carol, he's all yours.<eos> Wow. The first war I've won.<eos> Uh, Carol, all that's left is for you to meet my mother, and, uh, up she skates now.<eos> My son, I just want to say, I wish the four of you the best.<eos> Four of us?
My position won me many enemies, but also many friends.<eos> Could I have another drop?<eos> Good, isn't it?<eos> Is something wrong?<eos> No. Why?
Who asked you to lie to him, Sandra?<eos> Matei and I didn't meet until you wanted us to, and when you wanted us to, we did.<eos> I don't see why, given what happened to us, you come up with all this.<eos> Given what happened to whom?<eos> To you and your family?
We don't know what we would have done in your place. But the law's the law.<eos> He who persists in illegality will probably have to pay for it.<eos> As for Mr. Bulai, with your permission, we'd still like to talk to him today, ask him a few questions.<eos> That won't be possible.<eos> Why?
Did he hit you?<eos> Why did you do that?<eos> He should have waited.<eos> That's true, but you can't act like that.<eos> Why?
Holy shit.<eos> -Well, hey, congratulations.<eos> -Yeah, no, not congratulations.<eos> More like con-fuck-ulations... or whatever the opposite of congratulations is.<eos> Why?
So with the third, Concha Max, he does it again and totally brutalizes her.<eos> The next day he checks the papers, Internet, absolutely nothing.<eos> The next one will be... very soon.<eos> Thanks to who?<eos> Thanks to the police force.
If you help me, we'll finish sooner.<eos> I have to...<eos> I haven't seen my brother for years.<eos> He had a drug problem, he left and nobody bothered to look for him.<eos> Not even your mother?
- What?<eos> You heard me.<eos> You caught him, not me.<eos> It can't be me, it has to be you.<eos> Why?
Well, I've been up all night too, Liam, and I'm horny, so deal with it.<eos> Fine.<eos> Give me the photo.<eos> Stay here.<eos> Why?
I don't know.<eos> Mum, what's going on?<eos> Dominique and now this?<eos> - Ssh! Keep your voice down.<eos> - Why?
The world only knows you after the press agents and publicists and image consultants... have neatly packaged you for the masses.<eos> That's fair.<eos> Will you do something for me?<eos> Will you show the world what you're showing me?<eos> And if not the world, then at least my dad?
And now someone has to tell her.<eos> I'm thinking about repainting that wall.<eos> Starting over like Imogen.<eos> I love you. You know that?<eos> Why?
- Mrs. Underwood.<eos> - Mrs. Underwood. Claire.<eos> Are you in a lot of pain?<eos> Nothing I can't handle.<eos> Meechum?
- I know.<eos> I know, but... - You think there's more to the story.<eos> Exactly.<eos> I mean, five different papers and not a word about the bullet he took to the brain, or his military record, or his family.<eos> Uh, his family?
Now you must live yours.<eos> Give my love to Clarissa.<eos> Tell her I'm sorry.<eos> She deserved a proper good-bye.<eos> Grey!
Give my love to Clarissa.<eos> Tell her I'm sorry.<eos> She deserved a proper good-bye.<eos> Grey!<eos> Grey, no!
Because I don't do favors for guys like you.<eos> I did this for Chloe.<eos> Oh, stop raining on the poor woman's parade.<eos> It's about time she got some spark in her life.<eos> Spark?
Okay, I will do what I can.<eos> I will put out an APB on... angel wings.<eos> Thank you, and in return, I shall donate my services on Palmetto, all right?<eos> Sure, we could use the help.<eos> "We"?
Decker.<eos> Yeah, yeah. I'll hold.<eos> Okay, just don't forget tomorrow night's Taco Tuesday, okay?<eos> - I can't do it.<eos> - Why?
APB on Junior's out.<eos> We're trying to ping his cell.<eos> I'm glad we're finally on the same page.<eos> You know, ever since we met this kid, you've had it in for him.<eos> Why?
If you won't say it, I will.<eos> - Maze...<eos> - For your own good.<eos> Don't say another word.<eos> Why?
I'm going back to dance.<eos> Watch Quicky?<eos> I'm going to bed, I'm dead.<eos> No way!<eos> Why?
No, it was good.<eos> It's been nice spending time with you.<eos> Oh.<eos> Mmm.<eos> For me too.
What are you doing?<eos> You can't just come in here like that.<eos> He's right. The lights, the Kryptonite's weakening you.<eos> This is who you choose to side with?<eos> Against your own people?
It's like they say in the movie.<eos> - What movie? - The... The...<eos> "The Godfather."<eos> I didn't care for it.<eos> No, no, me either, really.
You'd love it if I assaulted a police officer, huh?<eos> Wouldn't you? Aah!<eos> - Apologize.<eos> - You're doing this to me?<eos> - Instead of Emile?
And... And can I, um... can I record our conversation?<eos> The county will record it for you.<eos> Okay.<eos> Uh, well, good luck today.<eos> You too.
Hey, it's just potato juice, right?<eos> No, you don't understand.<eos> He'll take it out of my paycheck.<eos> And I have a little baby to support, and my mom... she can't work on account of oldness.<eos> -I'm sorry--
You must be Laura.<eos> - You brought it into the house and we don't know anything about it.<eos> It was an accident. Before I knew it...<eos> How could you do that to Mum? To us?<eos> To Anita?
Master, forgive me!<eos> I won't steal the Boots of Iron again.<eos> There is no room for a scoundrel like you here.<eos> Leave.<eos> Master!
Well, we look at people who've been shattered and different as less than.<eos> What if they're more than us?<eos> What?<eos> Do you believe them?<eos> Your patients.
What's bothering you so much about this? It's not like we haven't faced threats from the past before.<eos> Catherine, Fuller is different.<eos> Those guys in my unit, they're like family.<eos> I trusted them implicitly.<eos> Especially Fuller.
That's enough.<eos> Can I please have some tape?<eos> Do you remember the last time you saw your father?<eos> Dinner a few months ago.<eos> Why?
And was he your only recent partner?<eos> He was my only partner ever.<eos> Oh.<eos> I told you I was old-fashioned.<eos> Why?
You know, I have countless black people in my employ, both at the farm, in my kitchens.<eos> Now, I think it's a crime the way people take things out of context.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Um... I think it would be wise to continue this discussion back in our room.<eos> But why?
I just want you to know that this... that this isn't what it looks like.<eos> Of course not, but, uh, real talk.<eos> Sometimes, what it looks like is all anybody can see.<eos> Anyway, um, I'll see you at the party tomorrow.<eos> Um, what party?
Stand by.<eos> Five?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> My head is pounding.<eos> Mine too.
_<eos> Not who you imagined?<eos> I've seen you and your woman walking the streets of Dharavi.<eos> What is it you hope to find?<eos> Justice.
Uh, Christianville's just dropped out, too.<eos> Apparently they got... oh, boy, they got a big parade on this weekend and need, uh... they gotta have everybody watching their floats and, um...<eos> Baton twirlers and whatnot.<eos> - So what are you down to now?<eos> Six men against what?
I warned you.<eos> A half strigoi is still a strigoi.<eos> The Born. He took it?<eos> Could be handing it over to the Ancients right now.<eos> Or even worse, the Master himself.
- She left town with her mother.<eos> You didn't go with her?<eos> Wasn't invited.<eos> - Sorry. - Yeah.<eos> Me, too.
Where's my King?<eos> You start!<eos> I'm going to ask you once more, why have you really come here?<eos> I made someone a promise. Who?<eos> A girl.
You start!<eos> I'm going to ask you once more, why have you really come here?<eos> I made someone a promise. Who?<eos> A girl.<eos> A princess.
When do we sail for Paris?<eos> You seem eager to fight.<eos> Yes, it's true.<eos> Not just for the sake of fighting, but for the beauty of it.<eos> And against the Christians, yes.
You'd worked it out before with Waerferth.<eos> Everything had been arranged.<eos> - Isn't that true? - It's true.<eos> And I ask your forgiveness. - My forgiveness?<eos> - Yes.
Nothing any good glass of Bourbon wouldn't fix.<eos> Could I just use your phone?<eos> I'm sorry. I can't do that.<eos> Have you ever had feelings of wanting to harm yourself?<eos> Others, sure.
Could I just use your phone?<eos> I'm sorry. I can't do that.<eos> Have you ever had feelings of wanting to harm yourself?<eos> Others, sure.<eos> But myself?
- Were you able to sleep?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> Working will help.<eos> - Understood.<eos> - You?
You really all spies?<eos> They... they jumped to their own conclusions.<eos> Does that mean you couldn't...<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - Me too.
I thought you were holding me so I didn't drop to the floor.<eos> Sorry the bed's so small.<eos> Don't be.<eos> It was the best night's sleep I've had in weeks.<eos> Me, too.
Su Yunjin!<eos> I told you Even if you go to the remotest corners of the globe I won't let you go<eos> Cheng Zheng!<eos> You move back to sleep, okay?<eos> L... I... I...
You'll break it.<eos> I'm hot!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Cheng Zheng, put your pants back on!<eos> L... I... I...
I'm not gonna hurt you.<eos> I'm not gonna hurt you.<eos> I'm here to help.<eos> I'm here to protect you.<eos> From Payne?
It all starts with Alexa coming into the shelter.<eos> She was terrified.<eos> She told me everything: the man in yellow car who had hurt her.<eos> About Porter.<eos> About her mother.
How do you explain that?<eos> The thief had the combination to the safe, sir.<eos> How do you explain that?<eos> I swear I've never breathed it to another soul.<eos> Not even my dog.
I have no idea what you're talking about, ma'am.<eos> Okay, I just need the manifest.<eos> I wish you congressional aides would talk to each other.<eos> I gave it out to another guy this morning.<eos> - Who?
So tell me, Captain, do I really have the wrong idea?<eos> Sabrehawk touch down.<eos> I have Sabrehawk touching down at the L.Z.<eos> Lincoln's on his way to the club.<eos> You guys ready?
I was trying things.<eos> It was a girl.<eos> It was Mom.<eos> You know who'd hate this right now?<eos> Robert.
"You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth."<eos> Kahlil Gibran.<eos> 68 hours.<eos> The clock's ticking.<eos> We ready?
Don't worry about him.<eos> He'll be fine.<eos> Who'd you think I was talking about?<eos> I thought you were talking about me.<eos> - You?
- Keep talking.<eos> - This is bullshit.<eos> She's lying!<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Thanks to you.
We want the warden.<eos> Help us take him down.<eos> Help us get some justice for everything he did to you.<eos> To us.<eos> To... to Petey.
Over 68 million Americans leave the safety of our borders every year.<eos> If danger strikes, the FBI's international response team is called into action.<eos> Gavin, come on. These ladies are waiting on their photo.<eos> Okay, here we go.<eos> Ready?
She saw me.<eos> She knew me.<eos> She knows about us.<eos> -How could I have done this to her?<eos> -I'm sorry.
I forgot Madison.<eos> You're really not going?<eos> Nope. I'm watching Byamba pick up Big Joe by his diaper.<eos> You are making my gorge rise.<eos> Why?
Then let someone else handle the damn call.<eos> All units, we've got a Signal 7 at the corner of Courtland and Baker.<eos> All units, please respond.<eos> This is Unit 16 responding.<eos> Unbelievable.
They're not coming back.<eos> And they're not in the garage.<eos> We'd hear them.<eos> They killed that guy.<eos> For what?
Just make it quick.<eos> This is Nancy.<eos> Hi, Nancy, this is... Chip with Cheesy Pies.<eos> I have a delivery for 1132 Bay.<eos> Uh, no. I-I'm sorry.
Come with me.<eos> Hey. You're not gonna believe this.<eos> So Lex said that there are these journalists inside the Cordon who might've been onto a conspiracy.<eos> That means there could be a whole apartment full of evidence.<eos> Against Cannerts?
- We're not coming with you.<eos> With Savage gone, we want to start fresh, see what happens.<eos> I give it three months, tops.<eos> Look, I just... I want to say thank you.<eos> To all of you.
♪ [indistinct chatter on TV]<eos> Eviction notice.<eos> Where's my booze?<eos> Tommy, how many people did you tell?<eos> One.
We want you and your husband to be safe.<eos> Safe?<eos> He said you made threats about using photographs...<eos> We need you to walk home with us, get us past the guard, and once we're inside, you're going to telephone your husband.<eos> Why?
Shut up!<eos> What do you know?<eos> I worry about that lad.<eos> I feel bad for him.<eos> - Why?
They are coming for him.<eos> You're gambling with my son's life!<eos> I am saving it!<eos> Majesty, I have entrusted him to one of my Musketeers.<eos> Who?
Get Marcheaux!<eos> We're fine, we're safe. Go, go!<eos> Go now!<eos> Stay, surrender.<eos> To you?
We're fine, we're safe. Go, go!<eos> Go now!<eos> Stay, surrender.<eos> To you?<eos> Yes, to me!
You'll always be a musketeer, Aramis.<eos> But if you accept the Queen's offer, you can watch over your son all the days of your life.<eos> As his minister, not his father.<eos> Treville guided each of us, as men.<eos> Musketeers, as men.
I bet Jesse could help you get some time alone with Spence.<eos> I tried, but he wouldn't let me.<eos> If you want, I can talk to Jesse on your behalf.<eos> On Rosie's behalf or your own?<eos> Rosie's.
Rosie, stop.<eos> The only thing that matters now is Tucker.<eos> He doesn't have a mom or a dad anymore.<eos> All he has is you.<eos> Me?
I just had a detox massage. Lemon grass, coconut oil, and jojoba.<eos> I don't know what jojoba is, but it sure is a hoot to say.<eos> Jojoba.<eos> If it's not completely obvious, they allowed me to drink vodka during my detox massage.<eos> Unbelievable.
If you need more time to prepare, we can run lines in the shower.<eos> No, I'm good.<eos> And don't worry.<eos> Your family's gonna love it.<eos> My family?
Kyle is my actual son, but everyone in The Circle is my child.<eos> And when I ask one of my children to handle a situation, I expect it to be handled.<eos> I'm sorry, Mother.<eos> Someone's going around asking about Peri's murder.<eos> Rosie.
I didn't tell anyone... except...<eos> Except who?<eos> Well, Danni, but you already knew that, and she wouldn't tell Peter.<eos> And you didn't tell anyone else?<eos> No, no one.
Yes, so we untied him, called the paramedics, and ran.<eos> Why didn't you report it to the police? He killed Peri.<eos> I think he's protecting the real killer.<eos> He said something about a woman.<eos> Rosie!
They'll probably view your past experience as a plus.<eos> You are a glass full kinda gal.<eos> I need it tonight, believe me.<eos> Again?<eos> Why?
Nobody's seen him since. Amy was right.<eos> Evil he did at that place, maybe he went underground.<eos> Got scared his past would come back to haunt him.<eos> I think today's that day.<eos> Jessie?
You were right about Darryl's murder.<eos> It wasn't them white boys from Quitman.<eos> It was Eddie.<eos> Eddie?<eos> Why?
Oh, God, thank you.<eos> Now.<eos> - Drop that gun. - Oh, thank God. Thank God.<eos> Dammit, Terry.<eos> Why?
- Mrs Durrells?<eos> - Oh.<eos> - I bring you Lugaretzia. - Oh.<eos> Hello.<eos> Why?
I don't want to buy it up.<eos> I'm just tired of living like beggars.<eos> Well, I... I won't take up any more of your time.<eos> - Yiasas!<eos> - You too.
- What are you doing?<eos> - I am putting a rocket up your backside.<eos> Well, put it up Leslie's.<eos> Sorry to hear about your girlfriend, Les.<eos> Me too.
Well, you're a breath of fresh air.<eos> Oh, you're so sweet.<eos> Dennis tries his best to entertain me but he ran out of ideas some time ago.<eos> - I'm told I can be a bit dim.<eos> - Me too.
- Exactly.<eos> He always carries a gun with him!<eos> Mr Durrell, is it true you carry guns?<eos> Yes.<eos> Why?
And how were you familiar with it?<eos> I acquired the file from a former Major Violent Crime officer involved in the investigation into the murder of Tommy Hunter --<eos> DS Rogerson.<eos> I then passed it over to Gill Bigelow.<eos> Yeah, not to me.
I put a deposit on an apartment.<eos> I gotta go to work, OK?<eos> Dallas.<eos> You're better off without me.<eos> Why?
Please?<eos> That woman that I woke up next to this morning... she's the one I want to spend the rest of my life with.<eos> What are you waitin' for?<eos> This is what we have to do.<eos> Why?
'Cause we gots each other.<eos> Right, Mr. Softy-Wofty?<eos> Okay, look, I only said that to make you feel better, so can we all just not talk for the rest of the ride, please?<eos> I'm surprised you showed up.<eos> Why?
No, no, no, O-man. We don't trust the po-po in this house.<eos> - I need to talk to you.<eos> Frank. I was drunk and mad and stupid, but I told her I wouldn't tell anyone else, so it doesn't really make sense, right, that it's related to why she's gone?<eos> - It does.<eos> - Why?
All very well.<eos> "My feet are sore, papa." Me too.<eos> I prefer the Jordan.<eos> Yes. Me too, but do not tell your mother right away.<eos> Why?
We've won the man lottery.<eos> Look, it is amazing.<eos> You are the most amazing man I have ever met.<eos> Ah, well. There we are.<eos> Rosie!
Aww... Never say never.<eos> Hey, babe, what's with the grocery bags?<eos> Oh, just making dinner for my man.<eos> Um, sorry, I can't do dinner.<eos> Why not?
I am Inspector Reid.<eos> Your name and business, sir.<eos> I told them slops before.<eos> I don't talk to the police.<eos> - Slops? - Hmm.
When you saw your uncle John, your uncle Kevin go into the apartment in Miami, did you tell me everything about that?<eos> I've been doing this for a long time, son.<eos> What do you want?<eos> We need to talk.<eos> Why?
As a child, he pissed himself at thunder!<eos> He cannot do the hard thing, the necessary thing.<eos> And you know why, oh, pale one?<eos> Because, like most men, he lacks the strength of heart and mind to bear the consequence.<eos> Just like you.
This... is a list of meta-humans from my Earth.<eos> Ones that are known, anyway. The particle accelerator explosion was contained on my Earth.<eos> That didn't happen here.<eos> Then why wouldn't we know about other meta-humans here?<eos> Because of The Flash.
Exactly.<eos> I mean, she walked all the way here from Guatemala, but she can't make it a couple of miles across town?<eos> Place the ribs at a direct heat and let them cook for almost two hours.<eos> I love this.<eos> - Yeah. Thanks.
I mean, she walked all the way here from Guatemala, but she can't make it a couple of miles across town?<eos> Place the ribs at a direct heat and let them cook for almost two hours.<eos> I love this.<eos> - Yeah. Thanks.<eos> Thanks.
Afghanistan.<eos> It is the same infernal pit crazy idiots... Who they believe that a good time is beheading.<eos> Hey. Can we avoid?<eos> Hey, Red, can you tell contemplative your boyfriend you relax?<eos> Ex-boyfriend.
Good.<eos> This guy attacked a Georgian colonel.<eos> Insubordination.<eos> 's What your report says.<eos> Why?
I mean, we're a bunch of freaks, right?<eos> Come on, Jaime, we're all family.<eos> Like the Three Amigos.<eos> Four.<eos> Five.
Before my pact with Trigon expires.<eos> I...<eos> I would do anything to bring you back, but, Grandfather, I don't...<eos> You hesitate.<eos> Why?
- Hello.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> - Lembui of the Maasai. - Yes, hello.<eos> - Pelipel of the Turkana.<eos> - Such a pleasure.
I don't work for him no more.<eos> I don't serve him ribs no more.<eos> I don't want nothing to do with him no more.<eos> Even if I hated him, and I do hate him... I don't snitch. Not to cops, not to reporters.<eos> Not to anybody.
- Not now.<eos> - You brought him here?<eos> - I brought myself.<eos> It's serious, Doug.<eos> Ready.
Whoo! All right, come on, let's get back to the party.<eos> I couldn't have done it without you, Gordon.<eos> Yeah, couldn't have done it without your money.<eos> # Halt Catch Fire 3x01 # Valley of the Heart's Delight Original Air Date on August 23, 2016<eos> Unbelievable.
- Oh, shit.<eos> - Language.<eos> Sorry, honey.<eos> I've got to meet with Joanie's principal today at 4:00.<eos> Why?
Unless we're missing something.<eos> This time we've got blood on the shirt.<eos> Direct contact, maybe some kind of a fight?<eos> You mean Jesse killed him?<eos> But why?
Shit!<eos> Hanley's a dead end, Selena Callaway given us what, 3 names on a screen grab?<eos> We still got the girls from the Newman place, when they're ready to talk.<eos> - Maybe one of them killed him?<eos> - Yeah, but why now?
Maybe he deserves it.<eos> Always on his side.<eos> It's the eternal bromance.<eos> Do you trust him?<eos> Slade?
It's unacceptable.<eos> And I'm sorry.<eos> You said there's something you wanna show us.<eos> I want to show you where Jesse Wells is buried.<eos> Why?
It's down there. What is it?<eos> Get out of the way.<eos> Are you sure you wanna be here for this?<eos> I'm just thinking out what I'm gonna tell Julie and Alan.<eos> And Mark.
Ally's got something for you.<eos> Let me go get my jacket.<eos> It's urgent.<eos> Do I need to apologize for the other night?<eos> To me?
Did you post those letters?<eos> I know one thing for certain.<eos> Jakob has repented his sins. he has redeemed himself and now rejoices in the love of Jesus.<eos> Do you know what Jakob Marosi did to his victims? - To children?<eos> - Of course.
- I feel there's a "but" coming.<eos> It's a good one.<eos> Do you wanna hear it?<eos> What happened to me, you,<eos> Danny and Mark...
Now, what did Caleb say to you when he filled out your form?<eos> So, it turns out that Iris has had investments in six different countries and employed 11 foreign nationals, which automatically the OPM has flagged off as persons of interest pending inquiry.<eos> Hey, is this Drew's file?<eos> Nimah:<eos> Yes. Why?
We were all reminded of something last week.<eos> Life can spin out of control at the drop of a hat.<eos> You guys went through something harrowing, and you should be commended.<eos> All of you.<eos> Not just Perales.
Hannah's blocking me.<eos> If you can't get to Claire, can you get her to come to you?<eos> Time!<eos> Those of you who answer correctly will be moving on to the next phase... building a bias profile against someone very important...<eos> - yourself.
Harry. I'm so grateful for everything you've done.<eos> You... you know I think the world of you, but if you compromise me, or my work again... it's over.<eos> He's all yours.<eos> Where's my wonderful Harry?<eos> Rosie.
Now, will you get me out of here, okay?<eos> I have to make sure that Cat and Vincent are all right.<eos> Vincent's in jail.<eos> Well, no, he was.<eos> Thanks to you.
What's he doing in Portland?<eos> He's here?<eos> I didn't know that.<eos> If he came here to deliver a message, who's he giving it to?<eos> Lucien!
He's here?<eos> I didn't know that.<eos> If he came here to deliver a message, who's he giving it to?<eos> Lucien!<eos> Lucien Petrovitch!
You know you can run to Elizabeth as soon as I'm dead.<eos> Why can't you wait?<eos> We can't wait.<eos> We won't.<eos> Why?
Why can't you wait?<eos> We can't wait.<eos> We won't.<eos> Why?<eos> Why?
Well, it's either him or some nasty bastard playing stupid, dumb, little games.<eos> What is?<eos> What is? - It's from your dad.<eos> - Yeah, just get a bin bag.<eos> - No! - Sorry.
They were trying to break me.<eos> I hope we have an understanding now.<eos> All right, get him out of there.<eos> Why didn't you tell us?<eos> Unbelievable.
I will try to take as little more as may be necessary to beg your clemency.<eos> It is true that I saw a wreck come in, that I rode and told several villagers, that a number of people came upon the beach and that items were carried away.<eos> Though not by me.<eos> My house was searched... .. and none were found.<eos> Why?
Paige, that's not fair.<eos> When I tell you something, a secret, you can't just decide, "Oh, I think I'll tell my wife."<eos> I am trying to help here.<eos> Help who?<eos> Me? Of course you.
I'm not kidding.<eos> Uh... how is your mouth?<eos> It's better.<eos> I'm still kind of embarrassed, though.<eos> Me too.
No, it was the doctors, it was our knowledge, very simply.<eos> The King has had diseases his whole life, and every time...<eos> He recovered.<eos> Thanks to who?<eos> The Faculty and our skills.
- Well, I'd start with removing...<eos> Come on...!<eos> No.<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> Unbelievable.
$2,300 does not round up to $4,000.<eos> Well, news flash: I'm bad with math. And with money.<eos> Yeah, but without more money, we're not gonna be able to afford a lawyer for Cat.<eos> Please tell me you know her password.<eos> "VincatForEver".
Oh, you know, they just... tried to get me to confess.<eos> How?<eos> Every trick in the book. Hey, don't worry, okay?<eos> They didn't break me.<eos> Thanks to you. Thanks to me?
But you're about to witness the full force of a shadow government working in concert to crush you.<eos> And now that they know you have Elizabeth, they will stop at nothing to steal her.<eos> You and Agents Navabi and Mojtabai must remain by her side and guard her with your lives<eos> - until you hear from me again.<eos> - Thanks to you,
I know that I'm gonna miss your constant criticism of me a lot.<eos> I'm gonna miss that too.<eos> Sure there's nothing we can say to make you stay?<eos> Well, you know, there's always...<eos> Oh, too bad, so sad.
Mongolia has slain a mighty beast.<eos> And there are many more to come.<eos> We are coming!<eos> Great Khan, your dreams of world conquest are already well known to us.<eos> All of us.
I don't even know what he said.<eos> It was Arabic.<eos> He said, "Yes, Mistress, I understand,"<eos> and then something I didn't get, and then, "I will do exactly that to him."<eos> To him.
It was Arabic.<eos> He said, "Yes, Mistress, I understand,"<eos> and then something I didn't get, and then, "I will do exactly that to him."<eos> To him.<eos> To Mike.
Now it's gone.<eos> Gone?<eos> What do you mean, it's gone?<eos> I mean I read it. I spilled my beer on it. I tossed it in the trash, and then I went and got another beer.<eos> Unbelievable.
- He was here a moment ago.<eos> Well, he's probably begging for sausages somewhere, you know what he's like.<eos> - No, he never leaves me.<eos> Jip! Sweetheart?<eos> Jip? Jip?
A richer man.<eos> A man who I hope one day will prove worthy of your respect.<eos> Mmm! What are you doing?<eos> Removing the threat to our plan.<eos> Aah! - Mr Compeyson!
- Well, I... - But fear not.<eos> You will never again spend a night alone.<eos> Sairey shall watch over you and there's nothing I won't do to lift your spirits.<eos> Then perhaps you might find time to lay your healing hands once more upon my swollen appendage.<eos> Jip!
Well, they're offended we're here.<eos> Oh. Okay, so not so nice of them.<eos> Well, our very presence here means that we're questioning their investigation, which the Japanese see as disrespectful.<eos> Jack, the ambassador has got the Japanese government to grant you special permission to carry a firearm.<eos> - And the rest of us?
He was the most useless servant under the sun.<eos> But he taught me how to smoke a pipe and cheat at Loo.<eos> They left the money. - Yes?<eos> - Well, then it was no random attack.<eos> What, then?
And number three, will you do me a solid?<eos> Will you, like, clean this place up and just tidy up overall in general?<eos> Okay.<eos> Rach, I really mean it when I say don't tell anyone about this, okay?<eos> Not anyone, ever.
Problem is, I may have programmed Elo to be clinically insane.<eos> The only thing she said that made any sense was the name "Gerard."<eos> It was a real Hail Mary, but at least that name isn't that common.<eos> 20 minutes and 347 Gerards later, I found him.<eos> Hey, team?
Pretty tidy stitch job.<eos> - The FBI teach you that?<eos> - Yes, it did.<eos> Rach, I really mean it when I say don't tell anyone about this, okay?<eos> Not anyone, ever.
- The CDC warns NZT abuse is becoming...<eos> - I'm glad that's not you.<eos> - A major...<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Me, too.
And, my dear, for the first time in my life,<eos> I was speechless.<eos> Awesome.<eos> That is great.<eos> Unbelievable.
I lost the love of my life this year.<eos> And I've... I've felt very powerless, ever since.<eos> But tonight... Tonight I am giving... a great big middle finger to death because... Because I'm still here.<eos> We are still here.<eos> So, Justin...
I first started out in Selfridges in accessories as an assistant.<eos> I was ambitious.<eos> But I had no idea how I might progress.<eos> Mr Selfridge made that happen.<eos> Not just for me... others as well.
They're not growing tissue.<eos> They're growing children.<eos> With surrogates.<eos> Sur... Mrs. Warren, you came here to help this baby.<eos> Your baby.
I'll be fine.<eos> Wait, wait, wait, wait. What if Black Claw knows about the keys and knew they were in the trunk?<eos> Black Claw doesn't know we have the trunk, and the guys they sent to find it are dead.<eos> But the trunk did belong to Joseph Nebojsa, whose distant relative was a knighted Crusader.<eos> And a Grimm.
Have you been shopping at Men's Wearhouse?<eos> 'Cause I like the way you look.<eos> You know I exclusively shop at T.J. Maxx.<eos> They've been helping me spring into summer for years.<eos> Hey, everybody!
Any news from the victim, Crabtree?<eos> Nothing yet, sir, but I've widened my search, sent out a province-wide description.<eos> Constables.<eos> Come with me, I've found the killer.<eos> "Constables."
All right, well hurry up.<eos> You know I said I gotta pee?<eos> Yes?<eos> I lied.<eos> Why?
Take the sample Felicity.<eos> You don't need to be concerning yourself with this now.<eos> Hell no, no fucking samples.<eos> You're not touching me.<eos> Or her.
All right, hand me the stuff.<eos> All right, got it.<eos> Okay. - Let's go.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Darüber!
So she could keep working and possibly date other friends of yours.<eos> - Pretty much.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Who are you thanking?<eos> The universe.
The humans have no plan at all.<eos> That's where you're wrong.<eos> They have the same plan they always have.<eos> - What plan?<eos> - Me.
Come on, we gotta go.<eos> Didn't your daddy ever tell you not to run with scissors?<eos> - It doesn't look occupied.<eos> - How do we wanna approach this?<eos> - Fan out.
I remember when you were a couple.<eos> Oh, I remember, too.<eos> I'm just trying to forget.<eos> Because you have no loyalty.<eos> Not to this man, not to anyone.
I'm still your boss.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> I'm the chief of...<eos> Surgery?
How much?<eos> - $150. - Each?<eos> Fuck, dude.<eos> We don't have $150 each.<eos> - Sorry, guys.
- I don't know.<eos> Fuckin' Google him.<eos> Look, I told the other guy I'll pay him back in full.<eos> Whatever the cost.<eos> - Other guy?
Look at you, nigga.<eos> This shit is all going to your fuckin' head. All you care about is yourself!<eos> - Chill, bro.<eos> - And? If I don't, who will?<eos> Your miserable ass dad? - Yo!
You owe me, Ghost.<eos> You got close to me.<eos> You hired your fucking men to protect me, but you're not gonna kill me.<eos> 'Cause you have value, you and Tommy, and I need you to go to work for me to replace what you have stolen.<eos> Why now, Milan, huh?
This isn't over.<eos> Yeah, it is.<eos> I did it!<eos> I knew you could do it.<eos> Thanks to you.
Give her your dagger.<eos> No, no, I can't do that.<eos> Yes, you can.<eos> You can.<eos> Ready?
Uh, wait a second.<eos> So he was trapped in there, fully conscious but unable to speak for how long?<eos> Three years.<eos> - I can't even imagine.<eos> - No, me neither.
Oh, Dan.<eos> Listen, we're trying to help him as much as we can.<eos> No, no, no, please keep going, please keep going. Don't stop. I'm afraid we've lost him.<eos> No, don't say that, please don't say that.<eos> - No, please!
So, your 999 call.<eos> How long from escaping the house to making it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Two minutes fair?<eos> Five?
You're safe.<eos> Speak to me, darling.<eos> Are you OK, Ivy?<eos> You're sure you're not hurt?<eos> How about you, Em?
What do actions have?<eos> HE UNLOCKS THE DOOR AND OPENS IT Consequences.<eos> Excuse me, you haven't seen this girl, have you?<eos> Ivy Moxam?<eos> - No, sorry.
- Not right now.<eos> - Hi, I'm just wondering if I can stop you..? - Watch it!<eos> - Dickhead!<eos> They wouldn't let me come see you.<eos> Ditto.
I think I'm gonna tell him about the first time I ran away from home.<eos> I crawled to Detroit.<eos> Max, I think it's great you were able to look past Owen's situation.<eos> Even the sight of one of them can be disturbing.<eos> Hey, everybody!
Really loving your Periscope presence, Caroline!<eos> Okay. It's a small build.<eos> I still maintain that Periscoping will be great for our business.<eos> For the record, I was filming my business way before it was called "Periscoping."<eos> Hi, everybody!
- Ah, Danny!<eos> - Rosie!<eos> Leave her alone!<eos> - Danny!<eos> Rosie! Rosie!
Leave her alone!<eos> - Danny!<eos> Rosie! Rosie!<eos> Get off her!<eos> Rosie!
Lexie.<eos> Get up. Go!<eos> What the devil?<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Rosie...
What the devil?<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Rosie...<eos> Where's Rosie?<eos> Rosie!
Are you all right?<eos> Rosie...<eos> Where's Rosie?<eos> Rosie!<eos> Rosie! Rosie!
When you come over the top of the hill, what do you see?<eos> Something burning, but not on fire.<eos> Glowing, like an ember.<eos> Rosie.<eos> Rosie!
- They look like monsters to me.<eos> - They attacked us.<eos> - Damn you!<eos> - No!<eos> Rosie!
The man who just checked in down the hall, it's Bram Stoker, yes?<eos> Hopefully you're the only one who realized that.<eos> Why is he here?<eos> He's taking a little vacation, hoping to get some rest.<eos> - Why?
The inscription wasn't in his handwriting.<eos> The Home Office must have given it to him.<eos> Yeah. I'd want to believe that, too.<eos> Your dead husband shows up, begging you to drop the case.<eos> Why?
I am asking you to believe that the two of you are worthy of being found innocent.<eos> And what if I can't do that?<eos> Then you can march yourself down to Gibbs's office in the morning and turn yourself in.<eos> But I don't want you to do that.<eos> Why not?

FBI?<eos> They employ me as a consultant.<eos> He employs me as an inside source.<eos> And in that capacity, she has alerted me to a troubling development and may have grave repercussions for many of your clients and, well, you.<eos> Me?
And my name is Elizabeth, by the way.<eos> He couldn't find you, so...<eos> Anyway, he says it explains everything.<eos> Yes, it does.<eos> For you.
I'd like to be sure.<eos> Alexander Kirk.<eos> Talked to the guard.<eos> He says that his partner jumped him from behind.<eos> Why?
I'm sorry.<eos> Forgive me.<eos> Come on! We don't have much time.<eos> Come on, then, Hotaru.<eos> Everyone ready?
It sounded like he'd been asking about Yasaka.<eos> What shall we do about him?<eos> If you don't mind, I'd like to keep him.<eos> Why?<eos> Why?
Previously on "The Americans"...<eos> - We work for our country.<eos> - The Soviet Union.
Paige?<eos> I'm sorry, mom.<eos> What? What's wrong?<eos> I told him.<eos> Pastor Tim.
You don't feel you have the right to say something?<eos> No, it's not about me.<eos> It's not... It's not just about me.<eos> I have to watch what they do to her.<eos> Your mother.
Please, get out of here!<eos> Go back to your room.<eos> You promised me stockings, Willy!<eos> I have no stockings here!<eos> Why?
Wait outside, please.<eos> Look at me Rana...<eos> Everything's fine, I'll call you for the CT scan... Please.<eos> Make sure you change the locks first thing tomorrow.<eos> Why?
I can't, it'll be too much.<eos> No, this isn't foolish talk, Linda.<eos> When I'm walking in the street, I clearly feel these things...<eos> They pass me by, but it's as if they're laughing at me with their eyes.<eos> Why?
Rana?<eos> Hey.<eos> The pickup isn't in the parking.<eos> I parked it outside this morning.<eos> Why?
- Yeah.<eos> You need to talk to your counselor? No.<eos> Well, if there's nothing wrong, you need to go to school.<eos> You need to get back into a routine.<eos> What routine?
-They can. I don't.<eos> Well, before, they were putting Tiger Balm on their wieners.<eos> Hey. Are you allowed to eat popsicles?<eos> -Um, yeah.<eos> -Me, too!
I've given them the code name "Sandstorm."<eos> We cultivated an asset within the organization, and they managed to get word to us alluding to an impending incident in Times Square.<eos> We believe that Jane was a key member of Sandstorm sent to you as a Trojan horse, and we've been monitoring the situation ever since.<eos> The only reason we're telling you now is because we need your help to get to Jane before the CIA does.<eos> Why?
I'll spare you all the details.<eos> He wants to give it a try...<eos> Him.<eos> Not me.<eos> Rosie...
What's this?<eos> You pull out the nice bottle of wine and then decide not to open it?<eos> - Are you having second thoughts?<eos> - Do you still love him?<eos> Rosie...
Jerking off MCC?<eos> Who cares? I know it's been a while since you took the uniform off, but surely you remember what it's like to be on the ground in here, or maybe your fancy suit affects your memory?<eos> Enough is enough.<eos> You hired me to do a job, and now you're gonna let me do it.<eos> My way.
Please? I'll let them know.<eos> You should go now.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> --Ooh, it's hot in here.<eos> You hot?
Okay.<eos> There you are. What took you so long?<eos> Anyone else ever get an idea while in the shower?<eos> Sometimes I get an idea.<eos> Yeah, me, too.
What accident?<eos> Tell me something.<eos> Did you feel better after you murdered Derek?<eos> Did killing your husband serve justice?<eos> Ex-husband.
My dad thinks my boys were born to laugh at his jokes and refresh his Martini.<eos> Eli only just started calling Aiden, "Daddy."<eos> How am I going to explain this?<eos> Aiden wasn't your son's father?<eos> Uh, step.
Dad.<eos> Sweetheart.<eos> You okay?<eos> I'm sorry that we weren't closer.<eos> Me too.
No, I just like to hang out in this hallway.<eos> Right, sorry.<eos> Well, could you tell me what it's like?<eos> 'Cause I'm thinking of transferring from Cedar Ridge.<eos> Why?
I know who you are.<eos> Bassam has told me about you.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> The United States is keeping an eye on you.<eos> Me?
Who's our prime suspect?<eos> ZOMO, right?<eos> Okay, did we get any prints off that last postcard<eos> - he sent to his assistant?<eos> - Just hers.
Fine. I'll break your nose.<eos> Play your cards right, you get a little holy trinity going, am I right?<eos> Move. Move.<eos> Give it to me.<eos> Ready?
The second he has positive ID, Rich will use the phrase...<eos> "Mustard on the beat, ho."<eos> Supposed to be in my voice.<eos> Hear the phrase, take the room, got it.<eos> Not a second before.
Sometimes the bad guys need a nudge... a push to do the thing that you want to catch them doing.<eos> You might even supply them with blueprints to the building so they know where to park the trucks with the bombs.<eos> Sometimes agents keep their mouth shut when they're told to.<eos> Someday, you'll do the same thing, and if you ever cross that line, you better hope that you bust them before they actually push that button.<eos> I-I'm sorry.
The new deputy director pulled some strings.<eos> How does it feel to be the highest-ranking woman in Bureau history?<eos> Aah, I wish it felt better.<eos> Maybe someday I can get Alex her badge back, too.<eos> You guys ready?
The victim's family.<eos> Oh, yes, I remember.<eos> Hi. Nice to see you again.<eos> Sorry it's under such terrible circumstances.<eos> Yeah. Us, too.
It's not your fault.<eos> It's her fault.<eos> Let's blame her.<eos> I'm good with that.<eos> You?
Johnny-Come-Twicely was a bonus.<eos> Last of the Seven is too blurry for me to make out, but you knew Auggie so...<eos> Wynonna, you wanna know why I nearly got my throat slit?<eos> Because I've been helping the heir.<eos> You.
Your Murder House's reception is balls!<eos> En vagyok a ko boszorkany.<eos> En vagyok a feltamadas.<eos> - After she made me ageless...<eos> - Ageless? !
I will not have you become a scandal.<eos> I will not allow it.<eos> I trusted you. Trusted both of you.<eos> I will never forgive that man!<eos> "That man"?
Families will have to remain outside, I'm afraid.<eos> What on earth have you got?<eos> Courtesy of Mr Goldwin.<eos> Fancy yourself as a movie star?<eos> - Ready?
I didn't want to tell you this, but...<eos> People are wondering if there's change coming.<eos> Wondering?<eos> I can see why that would be discussed.<eos> Why?
People are wondering if there's change coming.<eos> Wondering?<eos> I can see why that would be discussed.<eos> Why?<eos> Why?
What, does the cat got your tongue?<eos> You're just overwhelmed by the awesomeness of this?<eos> I'm gonna ask you one more time.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Daryl.
If you want to make it up to us can you find where Negan lives?<eos> One of the trucks is going back there, so... yeah, I can do that.<eos> Can you keep it between us, just you and me?<eos> I don't like that.<eos> Me neither.
That's your truth.<eos> Eugene...<eos> I'd like to take it back to awkward silence now.<eos> Find what you wanted? Did just fine.<eos> Yeah, me too.
Oh, of course, you know, if you don't need a vacation from your reality, then, uh... hey, by all means, decline.<eos> Hey, smells good.<eos> You leave that stuff in the place?<eos> I need to talk to you about that.<eos> Why?
-She did.<eos> She told me y'all chased her down the hallway and Crazy Eyes was singing like a murder doll.<eos> Wait, what photo? What are you--<eos> We're trying to get a picture.<eos> -A picture of what?
I should have done it nine years ago.<eos> I-I mean, I've been asleep for a half-hour.<eos> Oh. Well, now that you're awake, I've been thinking.<eos> Since you're still on break and I'm off for another week, maybe we could have a mom and Brick day.<eos> Why?
And if nobody else saw the doctor dosing...<eos> Someone else did.<eos> Me.<eos> I saw Dr. Reybold dose a patient.<eos> My wife.
I'm afraid so.<eos> Dead or alive, it doesn't really matter.<eos> Stop, Axel!<eos> I need to hand her over to them.<eos> Who?
You see what's happening.<eos> - They're scared, I get that.<eos> - They're rats in a cage.<eos> It's only a matter of time before they turn on each other.<eos> Or you.
Tell him to close his eyes, Mohamad.<eos> Tell him to close his eyes!<eos> Do what you gotta do.<eos> See what you've done to your friend?<eos> To me?
I'll miss you too, Cisco.<eos> So I guess I can't text you from another Earth?<eos> I guess not.<eos> Thank you guys, seriously, for saving our home.<eos> Ready?
- Ashley? ! - Stay away from me!<eos> - Calm down and listen to me.<eos> - You tried to kill me!<eos> Well! Look who it is!<eos> The traitor!
How dense do you think I am?<eos> You really wanna know?<eos> Just divide your mass by your volume.<eos> Hey! What the hell happened to your face?<eos> Who?
When do you have the time, then, Mom?<eos> When? Okay?<eos> Because you don't like Tim McGraw, then nobody is supposed to like Tim McGraw.<eos> Catherine, you are forbidden from saying the words "Tim McGraw" ever again.<eos> Unbelievable.
Hello, Jonah.<eos> Richard.<eos> - Hi, Catherine.<eos> - When you talk to me, you ruin the film.<eos> Always a pleasure.
You bought yourself half a day.<eos> Consider us even.<eos> The smaller the boat, the smaller the signature.<eos> We don't bother with those.<eos> Why not?
- Mmm, big.<eos> Listen, any time you want Caps tickets, you hit me up, buddy, all right?<eos> And if you ever need anything international.<eos> - And congratulations.<eos> - You, too.
Luis... he was asking for you when he... you were on his mind.<eos> He wanted me to tell you that.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You have a heavy smile.<eos> Why?
Don't you swear at me.<eos> We don't work here anymore.<eos> For 10 more days you do!<eos> Unless you'd all like to quit and walk away from your entire severance packages!<eos> Amazing.
I know.<eos> Right? Okay, look, I can give you a few days, two weeks tops, but if you're not out by then, I'm gonna have to take legal action.<eos> This bums me out, man.<eos> I thought you were like the one cool tech guy.<eos> Me?
- Ah, two of my incubees off to eat the world.<eos> Be well, work hard, and know one another.<eos> Okay. I recently helped them install a new CEO at Pied Piper.<eos> I needed to take a more hands-off approach, focus on the future... incubees, like yourself, with great ideas, like cataloging malware.<eos> Sexy.
This is mega.<eos> This is what Hendricks did at Tech Crunch Disrupt.<eos> I think we just cracked middle-out.<eos> We should probably tell Gavin, right?<eos> Why?
They actually have exclusive rights to use the underlying algorithm in any form.<eos> Oh, no. That's not right at all.<eos> Yeah, so I think, Jack, we're going to have to go back to them and just change the language here.<eos> We're not going to be able to do that.<eos> And, uh, why not?
On family day,<eos> Graham Holt wouldn't talk to his folks so the judge gave him another month.<eos> You want that?<eos> So after your three weeks in rehab, Nick, exploring your thoughts and feelings about your drug use, are there things you need to say to m<eos> - You?
Looks so sharp.<eos> That's what we do here at Pied Piper.<eos> It... it's very impressive.<eos> I will have to tell my boyfriend all about it.<eos> Boyfriend?
It's in the bay.<eos> And if your Coast Guard would be a little more helpful, we probably could have dragged it out of there by now.<eos> Mr. Bachmann, you pay those caterers and bartenders you owe money to or I assure you, that, I will prosecute.<eos> Mr. Chugtai, I am gonna need all the phone numbers of the people on your list.<eos> Why?
What first time? What are you talking about?<eos> We both worked at Nucleus right here in this room.<eos> Yeah, before you fired us and rehired us to do the exact same thing without ever noticing.<eos> I invited you to my wedding, Gavin.<eos> Why?
Okay, well, everyone that I showed the beta to loved it.<eos> - Oh, shit.<eos> - What?<eos> Who did you give the beta to?<eos> - Your friends. Engineers.
Looks that way.<eos> Never heard of 'em.<eos> Though maybe Mateo did.<eos> You know anything about them?<eos> No.
But I'm doing just fine.<eos> Ooh, look at that. It's quitting time.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Y'all have a good night now.<eos> - You, too.
One last thing.<eos> Have you ever made me hurt anyone like this before?<eos> No, Bernard, of course not.<eos> Bernard? Hello?<eos> Elsie.
No, Bernard, of course not.<eos> Bernard? Hello?<eos> Elsie.<eos> Did you find what you were looking for?<eos> Elsie.
Yes, thank you for coming.<eos> Arlo Fields, this is Charlie Harris.<eos> Thank you for being a friend to my wife in her final days.<eos> Your wife?<eos> Uh, my ex-wife.
She's suffered enough.<eos> Oh, this is my family here.<eos> This is my wife, uh, Julia.<eos> - Nice to meet you.<eos> - You too.
River, River, breathe deeply for me, okay?<eos> - C-clamp stirrups.<eos> - On it.<eos> We're gonna deliver this baby now.<eos> That kind of break in reality...
He died an hour ago.<eos> Cyrus.<eos> I have to go.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Me, too.
Well, he forgave you.<eos> You're fired.<eos> I have to go.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Me, too.
Now, we're in the South Pole, so compasses don't work, so we'll have to rely on old-school navigation techniques.<eos> Forestry Brave Ralph, any thoughts on the matter?<eos> Count your steps and leave a trail to find your way back to base.<eos> 300-foot cable should do the trick.<eos> We ready?
Well, let's hope karma bites Mr. Boss in the arse.<eos> What's up?<eos> The Mayor officially shut down the Mr. Boss task force, what with my star witness, Blaine, losing his memory.<eos> And you know that smug son of a bitch is going to take this as a sign that he can do whatever he wants.<eos> Uh, Blaine or Mr. Boss?
Fine.<eos> I'll tell Mama.<eos> I went to give Gabe his tool belt back.<eos> What?<eos> Why?
- Hey. - Hey, stranger.<eos> Long time, no see.<eos> Guessing my kid's car seat really scared you off, huh?<eos> Actually, my mom had surgery, so I had to take some time off.<eos> Oh. Sorry.
It is a fine fancy, but no more than that.<eos> And you, Mr. Reid, a man equally resurrected, equally powerless to leave a place, come to show me my truth once more.<eos> Yourself, myself, attached to Whitechapel as if by lead weights on a riverbed.<eos> The betrayal of my husband, it is the same communication that has brought you in here now?<eos> No, merely police work.
Was there anything unusual about Adam and Grace's behaviour in recent months?<eos> Anything at all out of the ordinary?<eos> Doesn't matter how small it seems.<eos> I'm sorry, I don't get this.<eos> Why?
They're headed south.<eos> Give it to Bai.<eos> If anyone can ferret out a whore and a little girl, it's that fucking ching-ching.<eos> Wait.<eos> Jingim?
See?<eos> It wasn't me.<eos> So you don't hurt yourself.<eos> Or, heaven forbid, your baby.<eos> My son. Yes.
Do you want me to tell him we failed?<eos> I have nothing to hide.<eos> But you butchered a family of innocents.<eos> And you didn't.<eos> Unbelievable.
I will find her again.<eos> And then it will be forever.<eos> A kiss for every wife our son will take.<eos> I can feel him kicking!<eos> Jingim.
We can have brunch and get to know everybody, work everything out.<eos> We're not looking for a party, Mr. McCord.<eos> Doctor.<eos> Dr. McCord.<eos> What party?
- With the kid, Jesse.<eos> I saw what you done to him.<eos> Ca...<eos> You ready for me?<eos> Ready.
Why not?<eos> Come on.<eos> I, uh, I-I didn't tell him, by the way.<eos> Tell who what?<eos> Jesse.
I had my father run the plates against the government's black intelligence network.<eos> That car belongs to a secret government agency that tracks aliens.<eos> I bet you they're involved with Max Lord's disappearance.<eos> Well, I don't think that, um, anybody should know about that.<eos> Why?
Now, these two have goons managed to take out a number of highly trained and heavily armed security personnel.<eos> - Alien weapons?<eos> - Almost.<eos> An alien is their weapon.<eos> A K'hund.
Like there's nothing special about you.<eos> You are special, Alex.<eos> And you can't afford to throw your life down the drain.<eos> You owe that to yourself.<eos> And your father.
His car was right there!<eos> So the kids just come and go as they please?<eos> Mariana, why don't you go back to class, okay?<eos> Uh, Mr. Stratos, do you... do you think... do you think that Nick would, uh, hurt himself<eos> - or anyone else?
I promise.<eos> King Charles has annulled his sister's marriage at the urging of the queen mother.<eos> Catherine's act of defiance cannot be tolerated.<eos> I'm told a council meeting was called, but no one informed or invited me.<eos> Why?
Miss Sofia, heir to the third-richest oil baron in the world.<eos> Taking Daddy's lifelong hobby of big game hunting to the next level.<eos> Bit of a sore subject.<eos> They tell me you like punishment.<eos> Sorry, ma'am.
He says he wants no part of it.<eos> But if you can't prove it's yours, we're no longer free to raise the money on it.<eos> My uncle, he only agreed to my having my inheritance on the understanding that you would match the money.<eos> So you're telling me we haven't got a farthing?<eos> Annie?
Aye.<eos> Johnny?<eos> He's not here.<eos> He must've made an early start.<eos> Annie?
But surely those rules changed the moment they invited television into the coronation.<eos> That was their right, and a huge concession.<eos> - To what?<eos> - Popular interest.<eos> Their interest also.
- Sorry, Lilibet.<eos> - What for?<eos> I think you're going to get a visit from Mummy about all this.<eos> I realize I'm not making anyone's life easy.<eos> Yours especially.
I got to explain this to you, Henry?<eos> Yeah, you do.<eos> I gave my life to this city and the department!<eos> I sacrificed both of my marriages and my relationship with my kids to serve you!<eos> And your son!
Bad, Dorothy.<eos> This door list is as white as your ass!<eos> Where's all the goddamn people on this bitch, bitch?<eos> You told me not to publicize it!<eos> To normal people, stupid!
Forget it.<eos> Oh, no, please.<eos> It's like watching a bird fly into a window in slow motion.<eos> Well, you know, I thought we were exclusive, for lack of a better word.<eos> What, like monogamous?
Max, oh, my God.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Please tell me Elaine didn't get to you.<eos> I could never live with myself.<eos> Or you.
Dude, I don't know!<eos> I just want to go take a nap.<eos> Ben, listen, if you want to help Sandy, we're gonna need you to focus, okay?<eos> Why don't you find her?<eos> "Her"?
Drea told me she was a lawyer, too.<eos> You remember what the badge said?<eos> I saw letters...<eos> A.U.S.A.<eos> Why?
Tell Jake I say hi!<eos> Oh, my God! I can't believe we finally made it to Coachella!<eos> Hey, ah, this is Coachella, right?<eos> (Laughs) Well, we're a day late, 450 bucks in the hole, we got the worst space in the festival, but we've made it!<eos> Yeah! Thanks to you!

That's all.<eos> - She knows how you feel.<eos> - Yeah!<eos> - Oh, that sucks.<eos> - Why?
- Good luck. - Yeah.<eos> - Madam President.<eos> - Dr. Abernathy.<eos> - If you could please have a seat.<eos> Gary. - Dr. Abernathy.

At this rate, these anomalies will consume this facility in just five days,<eos> - if we're lucky.<eos> - So what are our options?<eos> We must prevent this last paradox.<eos> Primary in '57.

Hey, Fisher.<eos> Nice job with the bodyguard.<eos> You see any photos of Mei Ling talking to anybody?<eos> Anyone or anything that doesn't look quite right?<eos> No. Why?
It was right when the anomaly happened.<eos> How are you feeling?<eos> I'm fine. I'm fine.<eos> - Coco's father.<eos> - De Deshei?
How dare she show her perfect face around here.<eos> - Mm. - I mean, I am kind of excited to ask her about the products that she uses, but how dare she.<eos> - What did Colleen say?<eos> - Oh, I didn't tell her.<eos> Why not?
Oh, my god.<eos> She's just about perfect, isn't she?<eos> Heather? Um, you're the one that said we'd make beautiful babies together.<eos> Angus, stop.<eos> Why?
You don't understand what you've done.<eos> Any disobedience can result in my daughter's death.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> If she disobeys you, she'll die?<eos> No, not me!

What's the count?<eos> There's one... one unaccounted for.<eos> You lost a student.<eos> I don't know how she got out.<eos> She?
After that she went her way, and I went mine. What do you mean by 'her way'?<eos> She must have given you some address? No.<eos> Any message for her family. I am sorry.<eos> Abhimanyu.<eos> Any message for me?
I've left a few messages for Dr. Glass.<eos> We have a patient of hers here who needs...<eos> Please don't put me on hold again.<eos> I'm aware of that, but...<eos> Unbelievable.

Everything okay?<eos> Your father's will arrived this morning.<eos> He didn't have much to leave.<eos> He had his house... Which he left to you.<eos> To me?
I fell.<eos> It's nothing.<eos> So Cal wants me to do The Walk.<eos> What?<eos> Why?
Gina, if you met this guy...<eos> Oh, I think I will.<eos> They're initiating an investigation.<eos> - Into what? - You.<eos> And Dr. Hudson.
It was crazy out there. We just followed protocol.<eos> Did you say Doc McStuffins? Yeah.<eos> She's a cartoon character that operates on her toys.<eos> You probably shouldn't have told me that.<eos> Why?
You know what?<eos> I'm good. I actually got at Mike's cheesesteak before the trash went out.<eos> Just say it.<eos> What... I'm... kind of worried about her.<eos> Why?

And she's kind of my girlfriend.<eos> I can't just leave her hanging.<eos> Fine.<eos> Fine.<eos> - Hey, thanks, man. - Yeah.
Brandon, I am so sorry.<eos> Thanks, Mom.<eos> Hey, Mat, wait up.<eos> Hey, I'm sorry.<eos> Yeah, me too.
She only starved your son to punish him for tracking in mud.<eos> Gave away his dog when he was caught shoplifting bubblegum.<eos> And you still believe that barking, shedding mutt was given away.<eos> You never wondered why the rose bush in the south garden grew so fast and full?<eos> To my son, Blaine.
Oh, my God.<eos> Wait.<eos> This is our newspaper.<eos> I drew this.<eos> Why?
So, what's the deal with you?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Why did you stay away all these years?<eos> Nobody talks about it.<eos> - Why?
Thank you for doing this.<eos> John looked out for my brother, I owe him one.<eos> Hope this does what you need it to.<eos> Maybe dinner tonight is not such a great idea, Meggie.<eos> Why not?
- Really.<eos> - So there's nothing to worry about?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> He's fine.<eos> He?
- Hey, Meems, this is the, uh, fat guy from school we used to make dance for chocolate.<eos> - In all fairness, uh, Benjamin would peg chocolate at my head while I was already dancing.<eos> - He what?<eos> - Benny-boo, I don't want to lose The Lisbon to these fat people.<eos> - The hell?

Yeah, well, I won't have to worry about that now.<eos> We've got him in custody.<eos> Good.<eos> If you ever need anything from me, to protect you or or your family please let me be there for you.<eos> As a very... very good friend.
- These are imponderable questions, sir.<eos> And their only answer is insurance.<eos> Mr. Lyon, have you sold insurance policies<eos> - to the members of the golf club?<eos> - To nearly every member.
- This is your putter.<eos> - Not any longer, no.<eos> Sold it three weeks back.<eos> To whom did you sell it?<eos> That right drunk duffer, uh...

Mr. Newsome's transgressions are far greater.<eos> (scoffing) Newsome is a fool who never wins a single round.<eos> Benedict liked to win, he gloried in his victory every chance he got.<eos> And when I cried foul, he accused me of being a poor sport.<eos> Me!

He saw I was upset and... he's easier to talk to than you and Mum right now.<eos> Fair enough.<eos> You're not going to say anything, are you, to Eddie?<eos> - No, course not.<eos> - Or Mum?

And I'm glad you looked beyond all those fancy degrees - and chose me.<eos> - Ah, well, like you said, the more degrees, the more likely he's a horse's ass.<eos> Uh, Dr. Dreessen, this is Dr. Masters.<eos> - You already know Dr. Leveau.<eos> - A pleasure.
Luckily for you, you got one.<eos> I'm sorry. You've been Zelena's doting sister for all of what, three hours? No.<eos> Who's going to be more motivated than me?<eos> Emma.<eos> What? Why?
- There has to be another way.<eos> - Emma, please.<eos> You're telling me no one's gone to the Underworld and brought someone back?<eos> They have.<eos> Who?
The store is packed.<eos> Well, tell them to buy juice at 7-11 like normal people!<eos> I need you to call your friend Roland or Scott, or whatever his name is.<eos> What?<eos> Why?
Actually, I need another favor.<eos> Do you have reports of accidents on the Double Road flyover?<eos> That flyover?<eos> I use it on my way to work.<eos> Why?
Good luck.<eos> Thank you sir.<eos> Aditya, what happened? !<eos> Nothing, the glass fell down.<eos> Why?
Our company manages computer systems for the NSA.<eos> Because Dalton was on the account, he was given top-level security clearance.<eos> We believe he used it to download classified material.<eos> What kind of material?<eos> Black ops Intel.
He's not gonna let me.<eos> You have to come back to me!<eos> Do you hear me, Josie?<eos> Josie!<eos> Josie?
I owe his old man, so I want to help.<eos> So you're just going to keep transferring him from precinct to precinct forever?<eos> You know, for somebody as smart as you, you sure are thick as a brick sometimes.<eos> I wanted him transferred to your precinct right out of the Academy so he could be close to you.<eos> Why?
- Help me get it off?<eos> - Yeah, let's do it.<eos> Hey, will you bandage him, and I'll start an IV?<eos> - On it.<eos> - Herrmann, Otis, backboard and stretcher. You guys ready?
Well, I know that you and Captain Hicks have been against this project as soon as you found out that Massoud Tahan was an American citizen.<eos> So you want to get rid of both of us.<eos> Uh-oh.<eos> Alicia's in trouble.<eos> Why?
Yet you, Frosty, Jesus.<eos> How's Julia?<eos> Well, she tore out my heart and ran it over with a pickup... that I bought her.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.<eos> - Yeah, me too.
Is it another concussion?<eos> Can't say for sure yet.<eos> We're doing a CT of his head and cervical spine to make sure there's no bleeding.<eos> That might require surgery.<eos> Surgery?
I don't think I want to take that ride.<eos> It's pretty.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I don't like it here.<eos> Yeah, me, neither.
I know it's late and you're getting ready for bed, and I'm embarrassed to admit this, but this is all my fault.<eos> You see, Lee picked up a package for me a couple of weeks ago, and he kept telling Jake he'd bring it to him and he never did, and that's why we're so rudely imposing.<eos> Lee's... he doesn't stay here.<eos> They're having troubles, and Marina's asleep with the babies.<eos> So... sorry.
No one saw me.<eos> Yes.<eos> But they know I'm here.<eos> Compliments of a nobleman in the village.<eos> Lord Vendell.
You, like, look at a person's face, and if they're smiling, you're fine, and if they're not, then you're sad.<eos> - It- isn't that normal?<eos> - Yeah, for a five-year-old, but you're 50, you know?<eos> And there are reasons why I need some boundaries.<eos> - I - Why?
It was just a lot.<eos> First Jacob, then you.<eos> I just, I just needed... Structure.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Yeah, me, too.
Huh, that was easy.<eos> So it's gonna be hard but not impossible.<eos> The DA says the first step is establishing that your material predates Angelique's.<eos> Did you e-mail the chapter to anyone around then, so we can, you know, establish your timeline?<eos> Yeah, um, Rafael.
I see you got a head start.<eos> Two years worth.<eos> I heard you almost got him in London.<eos> I'm--I'm really sorry about what happened.<eos> Yeah, me, too.
His third DWI.<eos> You know, when I first started working at the DA's Office for you,<eos> Ellen used to bring me sandwiches.<eos> She used to tell me that I was too skinny.<eos> Me, too.
Sorry to drop in unannounced.<eos> You're a judge.<eos> You can do whatever you want.<eos> I was sorry to hear about your suspension.<eos> Me, too.
And guess what.<eos> You were right.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Why would you do this to me?<eos> To you?
He's just a murderer after all.<eos> Attention, everyone!<eos> Salute the warden!<eos> Hello, sir!<eos> At ease.
Listen. From now on, you need to face those you fear most.<eos> Gangsters.<eos> - Come on in. - Yes, sir.<eos> Prosecutors.<eos> Politicians.
Let's continue.<eos> Alright.<eos> Let's see where it leads us.<eos> Yes, your honor.<eos> Next...
I'm not the one you want me to be.<eos> My work comes first.<eos> Always.<eos> I'm glad I worked that out before I met you.<eos> Terrific.
No, I'm sorry you made a major life decision for this only to have...<eos> That's not why I made it.<eos> It's just what precipitated it.<eos> Excuse me, Dr. Adams, is the girl in the family room with you?<eos> - Yes, why?
Everything in my life makes sense suddenly.<eos> His travel, the way he is around the house.<eos> Like, not here when he's here.<eos> Have you told anyone?<eos> You.
Thank you.<eos> You never saw me cry before. Now it's all I do.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I'm so relieved.<eos> Me, too.
If that's what you want me to do, sir.<eos> - Yes?<eos> - Edmund, it's me.<eos> Madame.<eos> Edmund.
That's it, and I get arrested.<eos> Haven't been within a million feet of her since.<eos> So if she's saying different, she can kiss my ass.<eos> - Where were you this morning?<eos> - Why?
If it's all the same, sir, I believe work will help to focus my mind.<eos> I know that getting back to it has always helped me in times of trouble, sir.<eos> So...<eos> What do we know about the dead man?<eos> Unfortunately, not very much, sir.
I left there to get away from all of this.<eos> I have built a life for my son.<eos> You're wasting time.<eos> I'm sorry to hear about what happened.<eos> Me too.
I have built a life for my son.<eos> You're wasting time.<eos> I'm sorry to hear about what happened.<eos> Me too.<eos> Me too.
With my late husband David.<eos> Two of them were thick as thieves.<eos> Drinking and gambling every night at the Old Bluff.<eos> Sandi, you said that you weren't friends with Harry, but he kept sending you money.<eos> Why?
Oh.<eos> Damn it!<eos> Okay, I have something to tell you,<eos> - and I can't tell you how I know it.<eos> - Why?
Okay, I have something to tell you,<eos> - and I can't tell you how I know it.<eos> - Why?<eos> - I just can't.<eos> - Why?
He claimed it was an accident.<eos> Was it?<eos> Unclear.<eos> The case ended in a mistrial.<eos> Why?
If it doesn't work, we'll try yours.<eos> I know you're scared, peanut, but everything's gonna be okay.<eos> But why are we here?<eos> 'Cause this, uh... this is gonna be our new home.<eos> But why?
- Miss DiMello?<eos> - Y-yes, is it over?<eos> Is... is everything okay?<eos> The baby's fine.<eos> Oh, my God.
Yeah, I get that, too.<eos> Right about the time of day I need a gallon of coffee.<eos> What is so difficult about following one simple rule?<eos> Oh, you mean seeing us one at a time?<eos> Yeah. Sorry.
Illama Iqbal.<eos> - Yes, of course.<eos> You see, lady...you're giving me a great opportunity to fulfill the biggest dream of my life.<eos> My desire to catch an Indian spy is finally complete.<eos> Alhumdulillah!
- Yes, of course.<eos> You see, lady...you're giving me a great opportunity to fulfill the biggest dream of my life.<eos> My desire to catch an Indian spy is finally complete.<eos> Alhumdulillah!<eos> -Alhumdulillah!
You've only been here two days.<eos> I'm... I'm like... really smart.<eos> You're... different.<eos> Uh, you need to rehire Seo-yeon.<eos> Why?
Well, I hope it fared better in your dream than in real life.<eos> It doesn't matter anymore.<eos> I've decided to close it.<eos> Really?<eos> Why?
No second chances.<eos> Everything's gone.<eos> All gone!<eos> What the hell do you want?<eos> Justice.
You are a liar and a murderer.<eos> You're insane!<eos> I am a kingsguard!<eos> You were.<eos> Thanks to Catherine.
It's nothing.<eos> Just a lot on my mind.<eos> Same as you.<eos> It's okay to have hope. We're doing well.<eos> The town?
I need you to have faith, CJ.<eos> You say that the world fell but you're forgetting all of the people that Pilcher saved.<eos> You are a part of that.<eos> And what will you tell them? Hmm?<eos> Group A.
What do you mean keep him here?<eos> He saw my face. He knows.<eos> You do not let him leave.<eos> He can't leave.<eos> Reggie.
Sir, leave now.<eos> You've failed.<eos> No-one here believes a word you say.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> To yourself.
You've failed.<eos> No-one here believes a word you say.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> To yourself.<eos> To us.
I'll find out.<eos> No, Maggie.<eos> I told him you were a wildcat.<eos> What?<eos> ! Why?
Blake, we need an ambu bag.<eos> And let's keep the blood coming.<eos> We got to go.<eos> Let's get her in there.<eos> Ready?
Last year, when you were on leave...<eos> Santiani booked a vacation.<eos> Justin wanted to see a rocket launch at Cape Canaveral.<eos> Two days out, she cancels.<eos> Why?
You know where it is.<eos> And don't say anything to anyone.<eos> Who the hell is Chase Carter?<eos> - He's a reporter.<eos> Why?
A good man.<eos> But, well, as company, as a companion...<eos> An empty taxi pulled up at the House of Commons, and Mr. Attlee got out. [laughs] Quite. [sighs] Now you may congratulate me in return.<eos> What for?<eos> My rapid recovery.
It's just a bird, Louise.<eos> What kind of person... gets pleasure out of death?<eos> Can you help us?<eos> I just need a couple of quid, that's all.<eos> No, sorry.
How difficult it must be for you.<eos> It was, at first, but now she has a nurse and a maid.<eos> Is that not expensive?<eos> How strange it must be for you here, without Francis.<eos> No more than for you.
Waste of time.<eos> Might be a dead end.<eos> Sonja.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Flat tire.
I would suggest you start talking.<eos> Take up arms for a corrupt government-- like these men, like you-- a price will be exacted.<eos> I can exact a price from you, Zed.<eos> I'm already in prison the rest of my life.<eos> Thanks to you.
Mario, what are you talking about?<eos> He's abusing Adderall.<eos> I thought I was protecting him, but I was wrong.<eos> We have to help him before he really hurts himself.<eos> - Or someone else.
Not yet. I wanted to question Lamb, but he's MIA, released from prison six months ago. He's been off the grid ever since.<eos> Well, have you found evidence other than these photos that Emily's death was not an accident?<eos> Believe me, I have tried, but it is an eight-year-old case.<eos> It's not exactly easy for us to open it up for reinvestigation.<eos> You and Sebastian?
Chad... it's Chanel.<eos> What is the name of your goat that you secretly keep in your house and milk because you're lactose intolerant?<eos> Say what now?<eos> "R"... "A"... "M."<eos> Rammy!
Your Majesty.<eos> As your Scottish advisor, I-I was hoping to sit in.<eos> The summit is for official advisors.<eos> It would be best if our arrangement stayed between us.<eos> Elizabeth?
You want to go fool around on the couch till it dings?<eos> Affirmative.<eos> So, how was your day?<eos> Oh, on balance, one of the good ones.<eos> You?
Maybe.<eos> But Mary's good sense has taken her to the right decision.<eos> No, I am sad because... ..I should have liked Greshamsbury to be saved.<eos> I do not understand you.<eos> To me?
But Mary's good sense has taken her to the right decision.<eos> No, I am sad because... ..I should have liked Greshamsbury to be saved.<eos> I do not understand you.<eos> To me?<eos> To you.
O... OK, look...<eos> I shouldn't be telling you this.<eos> I mean, it could get me into a lot of trouble.<eos> You were making payments to Station House Number Five.<eos> - To whom?
- He chose Toronto.<eos> - He didn't choose anything, we did.<eos> You sent a criminal to my city without so much as a courtesy call?<eos> Informing you of his whereabouts would have defeated the purpose, Inspector.<eos> Unbelievable.
How did you find out Mr. Sachs was in Toronto?<eos> You just told me.<eos> Mr. Falcone, we know you didn't kill Gerry Sachs, but we have strong evidence that his murder is connected to you.<eos> Who did you order to kill Sachs?<eos> Your son?
Sure thing, kid.<eos> Just give it back when you're done.<eos> Well, now that we're starting fresh, can we please finally get rid of that hideous duck painting?<eos> - No, Louis, we can't.<eos> - Why not?
Hey, pay no attention to Holly. She's jealous.<eos> OK, bucket, yeah?<eos> It's because you're the favourite.<eos> I know, you're not supposed to say that, but you are.<eos> Right, but why?
And he did try and make amends.<eos> How?<eos> He bought me a bottle of Scotch to say sorry when he couldn't.<eos> Apparently, Todd had already passed it on to a mate of his.<eos> Who?
Jesus, Don.<eos> You're bleeding all over yourself.<eos> He won't give us the address to the government safe house.<eos> Why not?<eos> Why not?
I wouldn't even begin to tell you what to do with your wine list.<eos> Just... Just relax, all right?<eos> Look, I got this.<eos> All right, who am I paying around here?<eos> You?
Tell her to turn her car around and go back home.<eos> I'll explain later.<eos> dr.<eos> Yu, i presume? Oy! Please put your hands where we could see them.<eos> oh, so sorry.
He's right.<eos> It's not against the law to carry cash, no matter how much.<eos> Listen, i admit to buying the gun, But that doesn't matter Because i sold it a couple of days ago.<eos> You sold it?<eos> To who?
- Shh.<eos> That's one of the reasons why the NSA is working so hard to get Dellinger back.<eos> They don't want the Canadians to have him.<eos> Call the system admin.<eos> Why?
Oh, and he hated our lawyer, the bank that foreclosed on our house, the people who bought it for half what we paid for it.<eos> Our mortgage broker.<eos> All mortgage brokers, really.<eos> Our neighbors.<eos> Me.
Hey, Rick.<eos> Michael Tao.<eos> Tell me, what do you know about the actor Chris Walker?<eos> Rusty: So, he's basically a dude in a gold raincoat who figures out how to change the weather to fight crime.<eos> Wow. So believable.
If we can prove that the eight murders you committed were connected to a larger conspiracy, there could be other defendants in this case, and your ability to act as your own counsel could go away.<eos> Ask Mr. Calderon.<eos> He may have been stupid enough to let you capture him, but Henry Colson will never testify against me, and you'll need better luck taking down his father and brother... Luck and, uh, maybe a tank.<eos> We will do whatever is necessary to obtain justice for our victim.<eos> Justice?
In the English-speaking world.<eos> He freaks out over the shooting stuff.<eos> I never saw him again.<eos> Can you recall how you met Billy or what he did for a living?<eos> No. Sorry.
I know.<eos> Don't get me started.<eos> Lieutenant, did I miss something?<eos> Well, a lot of people missed something.<eos> Possibly even me.
No, we should get to know each other.<eos> And you don't know me till you've had my barbeque.<eos> Right, Paul?<eos> You said ribs?<eos> Yeah, and game hens.
And if the Grail really was the beginning of all magic...<eos> This might be the end of it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Stand back.<eos> Why?
I can prove that the marriage is fake,<eos> I could subpoena her.<eos> All right, look, Cookie, come on.<eos> After everything Lucious did to you, really?<eos> To us?
Hey, man.<eos> Hey!<eos> What?<eos> Don't talk to her.<eos> - Why?
Nina?<eos> No.<eos> Maybe. But...<eos> nothing can come of it.<eos> - Why not?
It's all circumstantial!<eos> We've looked into it, we've ruled him out, and, just so you know, we don't fly solo on this team. Clive Bonn.<eos> He said he didn't know Carol Fincher, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why?
Thanks for being here, everybody.<eos> - Oh, we're just here for the cake.<eos> - That's true.<eos> W... Yeah, Ma, I want a... I want a big one with a lot of icing.<eos> Me, too.
I just saw him 'cause I wanted to see him.<eos> Or maybe it's that energy I'm talking about.<eos> We've all felt it one time or another, whether we want to admit it or not.<eos> - I miss him.<eos> - Me, too.
- No.<eos> Can you take a closer look?<eos> It's important.<eos> - I don't know her.<eos> Sorry... - Hey!
I know.<eos> I know empirically that there's nothing I can do, but...<eos> I just can't stop feeling responsible.<eos> I'm sorry, Maura.<eos> Me too.
Chicago's too far away.<eos> I needed to get away.<eos> I felt smothered here.<eos> By who?<eos> By me?
I wanna die.<eos> Oh, I want that for you too, Judge.<eos> -But you gotta give answers first, crybaby.<eos> You hired a bunch of ex-military bikers to assassinate me.<eos> - Why?
Well, frickin'<eos> Doc Holliday... Ha!<eos> There's a pleasant fragrance.<eos> Peaches? Yeah.<eos> Peaches.
Peaches.<eos> Wynonna, did you drink any of this?<eos> - What?<eos> - Did you?<eos> No, why?
Hey, I knew I recognized that ringtone.<eos> Whoa! OK.<eos> OK.<eos> Give me Peacemaker or I punch a bunch of holes in Waverly's girlfriend.<eos> "Girlfriend"?
It is more than that.<eos> Sasha was hidden for years, we weren't able to find a trace of him.<eos> Then, suddenly, he risks everything to come here, to spend time with... you.<eos> Hiding out here.<eos> Why?
-José Veiga.<eos> -Carlos.<eos> -I'm Carlos.<eos> -How are you?<eos> -A pleasure.
And what would you achieve with that?<eos> Discover that one wants the skin to make a cake, and the other, the pulp to make juice.<eos> Come on, José, for fuck's sake.<eos> You know they both want the orange to make juice.<eos> -Why?
I was thinking the same thing.<eos> Night.<eos> Night.<eos> Angelini's.<eos> Ready?
You okay?<eos> - Yeah, I'm good.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Up on three.<eos> Ready?
It's a nice 50 feet.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> - So, help me out.<eos> Which date was this?<eos> - Why?
Why not?<eos> Because...<eos> I blame you.<eos> Every time I look at you, I-I blame you for what happened.<eos> Me?
I'm sorry if you think less of me.<eos> I don't.<eos> Really?<eos> 'Cause every time I come in here, I think less of me.<eos> Why?
Because of my hard work, my dedication, my father has a loyal Pack.<eos> Does he thank me for that?<eos> No.<eos> The second your father appears out of nowhere, he runs after him like a mad wolf.<eos> Why?
You start.<eos> David Lee is hazing Lucca.<eos> He's got her doing a pointless 50-state survey to complete overnight.<eos> Yeah, he did that to me when I started.<eos> You, too.
Because I'm quitting.<eos> What?<eos> - I'm having Diane buy me out.<eos> - She...<eos> Why?
Thanks.<eos> I figure it's about time we had our first black president.<eos> Mm. It's about time we had our first woman president.<eos> Good luck in the election.<eos> You, too.
Old pets.<eos> The occasional dead bird outside the window.<eos> The other kids thought I was weird.<eos> They'd call me names.<eos> Morticia...
You just killed your own son.<eos> I owed a guy money.<eos> A guy?<eos> What kind of guy?<eos> A bookie.
Oh, Doc, should we alert the mayor?<eos> We got to tell the mayor, dude.<eos> No, Doc!<eos> Holy crap, you cut off his head, Doc!<eos> Unbelievable.
Nathan James, Nomad.<eos> Captain, I see an oil slick about a mile long.<eos> Heavy debris field, bodies in the water.<eos> No apparent survivors, sir.<eos> Sorry, Captain.
We always have.<eos> The world just doesn't know about it.<eos> Time is up.<eos> My aide can assist you in setting up a pardon for Eric Boyer.<eos> Not to me. To the people.
Like he was delighted.<eos> And I'll be honest with you, in that moment, I was scared...<eos> Of him.<eos> Of what he could do to his own team.<eos> Or his own son, for that matter.
Oh, that's nice. Now just get a bit closer.<eos> Smile!<eos> 'The once frail hospital flourished long after the visitors from 'Nonnatus said goodbye.<eos> 'But though they had given their labour and their love, 'they also took and they learned... 'and they went home wiser, enriched, 'in ways that they could not count.'<eos> Ready!
Now, can you please just tell me why we're here?<eos> Asking the same question.<eos> What the hell is she doing here?<eos> Haven't you arrested her yet?<eos> Me?
I used to love him, yes, but I'm with you now and I'm happy.<eos> Or I would be if you didn't whisper men's names during sex.<eos> Yes, OK.<eos> Are you OK...<eos> Justin?
Works for me.<eos> I got zilch going on.<eos> Well, that's great, Frank.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Uh, sorry.
Really.<eos> Flapjacks were the best ever.<eos> Glad you liked them.<eos> After you.<eos> Bye-bye, y'all.
W-Were y'all even gonna tell me about the meeting?<eos> Of course.<eos> Look, son, this has got Janet all twisted.<eos> She just wanted some time to... to figure on things without telling all the kids yet.<eos> "All the kids"?
All that was real was that my sister was dead,<eos> Daniel had killed her, and my... my one true friend just told me he wasn't coming back no more.<eos> And now?<eos> Tell him I'm sorry.<eos> Who?
Daniel had killed her, and my... my one true friend just told me he wasn't coming back no more.<eos> And now?<eos> Tell him I'm sorry.<eos> Who?<eos> Daniel.
What about inviting someone in from the outside.<eos> Like the GBI.<eos> Take a closer look into it.<eos> - Into what?<eos> - Everything.
Are you sure?<eos> We just let him walk?<eos> After what he did to Katia?<eos> And Jorge?<eos> And us.
Love, NCIS Special Agent Tony DiNozzo."<eos> Well, it's kind of sweet.<eos> He said "Love, Tony."<eos> You got any shots of the woman's face?<eos> No, sorry.
But look, I do want to tell you how pleased I am that you decided to come by.<eos> You know, when a man starts to get on in years...<eos> What did you say to Sarah Finn?<eos> - What?<eos> - Sarah Finn, my old girlfriend.
One of the trucks in the aid convoy that Nicole was with was spotted near a rebel compound or or something in Colombia, so...<eos> Have they found her?<eos> Well, the military's, uh, going into the jungle in about two hours, and they don't know what they're gonna find.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Yeah, me too.
Have you heard from the county clerk?<eos> No. I haven't, but she said she has to fax over the report and we need the power for that.<eos> Yeah, that's if she sends it over.<eos> I think she will.<eos> Thanks to you.
Hanna, the last time I left you in a room alone<eos> A.D. took you.<eos> So I hate to break it to you, girl but you're stuck with me.<eos> Well, I really want to be left alone.<eos> Why?
So now I'll text again, like, look. If you asleep, it's okay. But call me when you wake up.<eos> Though you should not feel obligated...<eos> Okay! I'm gonna stop you right there.<eos> Give me your phone.<eos> What?
! - Let's stay and fight. - I just had surgery.<eos> I am not about to pop my stitches.<eos> Damn it.<eos> Someone doesn't like the fact that you and I are back together.<eos> Who?
Let me show you the hospital.<eos> The new one your son helped build?<eos> The one that actually heals people.<eos> You can't go through with this.<eos> - Why?
I think she made a lot of people feel like that.<eos> Maybe that was her gift.<eos> Cos that's what makes life worth living.<eos> When people... .. let you know that... .. that you matter to them.<eos> So sorry.
Here somewhere.<eos> - How are you?<eos> - I'm fine.<eos> Good.<eos> Yeah, me too.
I put Gordon away.<eos> I don't need him anymore. 'Cause you, Todd, you're my new dummy.<eos> Your new... the new du... your new dummy?<eos> - Mm-hmm. - Okay, so it... it sounds to me like you're pr... pretty, you know, into this whole, uh, situation then.<eos> Right?
I'm not as... wonderful as everybody thinks I am.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You're the best.<eos> So... will you help me?<eos> Us?
Need we talk about blame?<eos> Please, a cease-fire.<eos> - For your father's sake.<eos> - Not your own?<eos> Me?
Okay, then I'll cut to the chase.<eos> I want to work at MacMillan Utility.<eos> Want is very different than need.<eos> - Okay, I need to work here.<eos> - Why?
No, sorry.<eos> Okay, well, thank you for your time. Thank you.<eos> - Thank you for coming in.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Unbelievable.
We'll sit down, and you tell me why you brought me here.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You think Zane contacted me about drugs, no?<eos> What else is there?<eos> Yo.
So what am I still doing, weeping over your body?<eos> I promised myself I wouldn't do that.<eos> We're, um... we're meeting in the war room in ten minutes.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You too.
Stop the war on Islam!<eos> Stop the war on Islam!<eos> Stop the war on Islam!<eos> I wept for this president when he lost his child... but now Bassam Al Fayeed used his American weapons to wage war, not against his enemies but against the people.<eos> Children!
Mr. President, one day, we're going to stop getting lucky.<eos> And when that happens, and that girl with the backpack gets further than her dorm room, people are going to die.<eos> And then you'll have to respond with force.<eos> And that's exactly what they're waiting for.<eos> Out!
Yeah, well, it's all grape juice to me.<eos> You missed your window.<eos> I have to go.<eos> Watch your television tonight.<eos> Why?
What is that supposed to mean?<eos> You tell me.<eos> Hey, hey, chill out, you guys.<eos> Hello?<eos> Jessie.
There is no cheating husband, nor an angry wife.<eos> What?<eos> How could you be so...<eos> I had no choice.<eos> Why?
Then untie me.<eos> Let me help you, okay?<eos> I can stop you.<eos> I know in my heart that I should.<eos> Sorry, Matt.
Oh, don't worry.<eos> Your pet's safety is my highest concern.<eos> Trust me, he's on board.<eos> Once she's been weakened, I will take the Mark back from Amara and use it to seal her away.<eos> You ready?
What you're doing to the sun --<eos> That's not me.<eos> With my brother getting weaker, the scales are tipping away from light.<eos> And into darkness.<eos> Into nothing.
Do you remember Seo Jun Suk's case?<eos> About pretending to help with the case. Or backing out of the case completely. Yes, of course.<eos> I remember.<eos> I... get the feeling that you're watching me from above.<eos> Representative Im.
- Copy that.<eos> Okay, 51, let's get a line in there.<eos> Copy that, Chief.<eos> Fire department, call out.<eos> Jeannie.
Okay, 51, let's get a line in there.<eos> Copy that, Chief.<eos> Fire department, call out.<eos> Jeannie.<eos> - Jeannie!
I'm still getting used to this smoke machine, but that is all right, because I'm very used to the rock and roll machine.<eos> Hello, Los Angeles!<eos> Hey, this first one goes out to all the survivors out there.<eos> It's a little homage to my favorite BJ of all time.<eos> Brent Junkins?
It's a little homage to my favorite BJ of all time.<eos> Brent Junkins?<eos> Oh, Mike, very funny.<eos> No, an even better BJ than that,<eos> Billy Joel.
Dr. Cooper.<eos> This is Sheldon's mother, Mary.<eos> How do you do? Nice to meet you.<eos> And his girlfriend, Amy. A pleasure.<eos> Hi.
Then come home and tell her that.<eos> She'll forgive you.<eos> You just need to forgive her first.<eos> He was lying to me in there.<eos> Why?
Okay, okay. You stay with her,<eos> Keep your eyes open and keep your hand on that gun! Okay.<eos> Mom...<eos> You found me.<eos> Very good, Detective.
Now you tell me sir, by law by law, sir was she right in doing so or not'?<eos> Falak Ali, please step down.<eos> This session of the court is adjourned.<eos> I am so sorry! I am...<eos> - So sorry.
How do you explain that?<eos> I'll tell you this: If I get involved in this shit, I'll take everyone else down with me, yourself included.<eos> Am I clear?<eos> It's signed by Billy Ohlsson. How's he doing?<eos> So and so.
You were right all along then. -<eos> - Yes, but she can't be linked to the murder yet.<eos> She denied, of course. - - Yes.<eos> Have you seen Jackie's goon again?<eos> - - No, thanks God.
We didn't stop.<eos> I mean, all weekend.<eos> We put it all out there. Put it all out in the open, and... yeah, we're gonna work it out.<eos> ♪ ♪<eos> Me too.
But the temperature's good, right?<eos> It's a little hot.<eos> Suck it up.<eos> I'll have a hard time explaining the third-degree burns.<eos> To who?
I'll have a hard time explaining the third-degree burns.<eos> To who?<eos> Hospital people.<eos> Got to be there in the morning.<eos> Why?
Something about her catarrh.<eos> Well, she must have changed her mind.<eos> I don't know what to do, no-one's seen her since last night.<eos> Well, Muriel lives by Croydon, doesn't she?<eos> Yeah, what of it?
Why are you wearing that on your finger?<eos> What about your precious diamond ring?<eos> I gave it to my son's girlfriend. Cause he loved her so much.<eos> Is she senile?<eos> My girlfriend? No.
As this ship's service android, it's my duty to protect the crew from harm... and, on occasion, each other.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> You know why our Two and Three aren't like them?<eos> Because of you.
Pope, blow out your candle.<eos> Who wants cake?<eos> Excuse me, can we get some girls over here?<eos> - Sure.<eos> - To Pope.
You missed your daughter's birthday to be with your girlfriend.<eos> Oh, please. Just don't start.<eos> - Turn it off.<eos> - It's one thing to do it to me.<eos> - But to her?
Check on him<eos> I'll check the flight crew.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Sam, help me.<eos> Kensi? Hey.
Everyone here all right?<eos> Kensi's stuck, but she says she's okay.<eos> They must have used a rocket launcher to take us down.<eos> How far do you think we are from those guys who shot it?<eos> Not far enough.
Which are missing?<eos> Ace of diamonds, two of spades, king of clubs.<eos> Only people who can pull off what you say are called "The Bootleggers."<eos> I give you information, you give me him.<eos> Me?
Cabe, I picked up, so you can clean up.<eos> I'm going, too.<eos> I'll see you guys tomorrow.<eos> Have a good night, Walter.<eos> Yeah, uh, you, too.
I have been trained in the art of war by Shimura himself.<eos> League of Assassins, class of '09.<eos> Don't take it easy on me.<eos> We got to go.<eos> Oh, hey, guys! - Wrong way, Haircut.
- Ah!<eos> This is a nightmare.<eos> If Mr. Rory's intention is to eat our brains, can you imagine the feast we'll provide him, given our combined intellects?<eos> Wait, wait! Ah, ah!<eos> - Comfortable now? - Ah!
What are you doing?<eos> Something I hope I don't regret.<eos> This belonged to the greatest outsider I ever knew.<eos> I'm looking for a partner.<eos> Cool.
My evil doppelganger left quite a mess.<eos> It'll take me weeks to reorganize my notes.<eos> Well, it's good to have you back,<eos> - the real you.<eos> - Well, thanks to your efforts.
- All right.<eos> How long have you had these abilities?<eos> They started manifesting a few months ago, but I'm assuming I got them when the particle accelerator exploded, just like all the other metas.<eos> And you haven't told anyone?<eos> Just you.
You and I... we've been through too much together to let each other down now.<eos> Please. Let me help you.<eos> Like you helped your mother?<eos> Or Wally?<eos> Or me?
So you need to know that, while you and your team have been in the temporal zone, I made a choice that affected the timeline.<eos> As you know, whenever you alter the past, those changes affect the present and get compounded in the future.<eos> When you return, you will be in the new timeline I created, where everyone's past and everyone's future has been affected, including yours.<eos> When you come back, don't trust anything or anyone.<eos> Not even me.
Amertek is helping us with a charity event, and all of a sudden, one of their vice presidents is attacked.<eos> It cannot be a coincidence.<eos> Not in this city.<eos> I have to go.<eos> Bye.
Anti-Crime unit.<eos> Killed two weeks ago.<eos> By a guy who's somewhat promiscuous with his choice of weapons.<eos> Apparently, he threatened another guy you might be familiar with.<eos> Tobias Church.
Well, what's hitting the street is a million times worse.<eos> Stardust.<eos> I'm not as out of touch as most people think, but I do have some work to get done, Mr. Chase, so why don't we get to the bottom of why you're so pissed off?<eos> I've been building a case against the dealer,<eos> Derek Sampson.
What's going on?<eos> At least we definitely know where Church is now.<eos> D'Angelo's right.<eos> We got to put him down.<eos> Against that?
If that's how you feel.<eos> [Henry] It is.<eos> And I am sorry.<eos> I realize this puts you in a difficult position.<eos> Me?
Can I borrow those for a moment?<eos> Of course.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I'm sorry, we...we have to go.<eos> Why?
Yeah, a couple times, he wrote me a doctor's note and we went there on a school day.<eos> I didn't know that.<eos> Neither did Mom.<eos> I miss him a lot.<eos> Yeah, me, too.
I thought you said he had an airtight alibi.<eos> All right, let's go, Iron Man.<eos> Mazie should have a peaceful journey.<eos> I really appreciate this, Max.<eos> And everyone else's help.
You can't keep doing this.<eos> This is, like, an entire day of the women I love telling me what I can and can't do.<eos> It's not really as fun as it sounds, Seyah Simms.<eos> Well, when the accord has been signed, you won't be calling me that anymore.<eos> Why not?
Your turn.<eos> What'd you find?<eos> Actually, I, uh...<eos> I saw you, Cal.<eos> Me?
Open fire!<eos> Sniper!<eos> I don't have a clear shot.<eos> I'm out.<eos> Yeah, same.
And his cousin said he was eating pork like it was going out of style.<eos> Parasites?<eos> Hand me the specimen container with the cyst.<eos> Look at those suckers.<eos> Unbelievable.
You are out of time.<eos> For you, I'll make some.<eos> What can you hope to do?<eos> One man against an empire.<eos> Against the daemons.
She did everything that she could t... to... to get her life in order.<eos> She improved her health, studied.<eos> She wanted to give you both the best possible chance.<eos> - But then they snatched you away.<eos> - Why?
I guess you could say that they gave me a sense of calm in a world that didn't.<eos> That's lovely, Sheldon.<eos> Well... other than when they're chugging through your bowels, these things are magic.<eos> I have to admit, I've been worried about the military applications since we started talking about this.<eos> Me, too.
I thought the ice cubes were kinda cool.<eos> Come on in.<eos> You gotta be kidding me!<eos> Being distributed to all the busiest houses.<eos> Thanks to you.
Shouldn't be a big deal.<eos> - Say something.<eos> - What's Casey think about all this?<eos> I'm doing this alone.<eos> Why?
We left it up in the air.<eos> Well, there is no news on that front.<eos> You just finish up your job there in Springfield and we will hold down the fort here in the meantime.<eos> Sounds good.<eos> Thanks, Chief.
Pat though?<eos> Oh, he's great.<eos> I mean, you know, he's definitely a... a rescue, might pee on the carpet from time to time, bark at a minority, hump some legs.<eos> But once we housebreak him, oh, he's gonna be lickin' faces and wagging' that tizzy.<eos> Tail.
Laura. I'm... I'm here.<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> - What?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Why?
_<eos> _ _<eos> _<eos> _ _<eos> Enchanté.
Tell me a little something about you.<eos> What do you like?<eos> I told you.<eos> I like helping homeless people and poor people, and...<eos> And blind people, right.
Acting on that lead, 50 federal agents and I raided a warehouse in Paramus.<eos> It was awesome.<eos> So you got him... it's over.<eos> We can go home?<eos> No, sorry.
Maybe it belongs to Gabe.<eos> No, no way.<eos> Okay, there's something else that we need to tell you.<eos> What? We made a boatload on the yard sale and don't have to move?<eos> Yeah, no thanks to you.
No, no way.<eos> Okay, there's something else that we need to tell you.<eos> What? We made a boatload on the yard sale and don't have to move?<eos> Yeah, no thanks to you.<eos> - Me?
General, or whatever the hell you're called, tell the men and women under your command to stand down.<eos> If you think you can get them back, why don't you go ahead and try?<eos> What the hell were you thinking?<eos> You took an oath!<eos> To what?
If you think you can get them back, why don't you go ahead and try?<eos> What the hell were you thinking?<eos> You took an oath!<eos> To what?<eos> To the service!
What the hell were you thinking?<eos> You took an oath!<eos> To what?<eos> To the service!<eos> The country!
- Ooh, some weed!<eos> Every great man has a sidekick.<eos> Batman had Robin,<eos> Sherlock had Watson, and I, Josh Kaminski, have...<eos> Me!
Oh.<eos> He's on his way.<eos> Should be here any minute.<eos> And this Gibbs, you, uh, you trust him?<eos> Like no one else.
Roland felt like George was nervous because of something that he might have seen rather than something - that he might have done.<eos> - Meaning?<eos> He focused his questions more on whether George had seen Daniel doing something to Hanna.<eos> Sexually, you mean?<eos> Yeah, and against her will.
Jake Fitzgerald!<eos> It's Sheriff Acosta.<eos> I need to speak with you.<eos> - Oh, I'm good.<eos> - Why?
It's my fifth year anniversary of being a cop and he's supposed to make me dinner... if he ever gets off the phone.<eos> Hey, babe, I need a left-handed spatula, okay?<eos> Don't tell me it's not a thing; it's a thing.<eos> Soul mates do exist.<eos> What a wang.
Who did that to you? Where are they? I will kill them.<eos> Oh, uh... truth be told, it was a child.<eos> You're... you're here.<eos> Uh, guys, you...<eos> - you ready?
No.<eos> You haven't tried to sabotage anything.<eos> Irrigation.<eos> Of course she's gonna agree with you. You're the Chief.<eos> And a fair one.
It was a hypothetical conversation. That is it.<eos> In which you were picking out hypothetical furniture for your hypothetical children's hypothetical playroom. - Wow.<eos> - It... it was nothing.<eos> - Can we drop it, please?<eos> - Why?
Look, in times like this, you have to be careful with who you trust.<eos> What?<eos> Hey! Whoa, we all need to calm down. Hey!<eos> She had the dead guy's phone and they just sent her back.<eos> Why?
Let him off with a warning?<eos> No.<eos> He should not be killed, he should be made to testify.<eos> Now, if you'll excuse me, Watson and I have got some...<eos> Against whom? What?
He should not be killed, he should be made to testify.<eos> Now, if you'll excuse me, Watson and I have got some...<eos> Against whom? What?<eos> You said he should be made to testify.<eos> Against whom?
Do you attend the wakes of all of your victims?<eos> I wasn't sure you believed me the other day when I said you wouldn't be harmed.<eos> This struck me as a place you'd be willing to meet.<eos> There's a... a nice crowd.<eos> Thanks to you.
I wasn't sure you believed me the other day when I said you wouldn't be harmed.<eos> This struck me as a place you'd be willing to meet.<eos> There's a... a nice crowd.<eos> Thanks to you.<eos> Or thanks to your father.
Everyone's out. I'm sorry about Rosie...<eos> You're from Reiden Global, aren't you?<eos> Not exactly.<eos> Is everyone okay?<eos> Yes, thanks to you.
Killed by you, they believe.<eos> What do you believe, Nathaniel?<eos> You have known me your entire life.<eos> Do you truly believe I could do that to a pup?<eos> A pup?
- Thank you very much.<eos> - Great job, Frank!<eos> But... but listen, now... now that we got the hot water turned on, we want to make sure that it stays on, and let's keep food and illicit substances in our belly.<eos> So I'm sending you out in groups to ply the most basic commerce known to mankind...<eos> Begging, okay?
It loops time.<eos> We've been reliving the same day over and over.<eos> Oh, brother!<eos> If you don't help us, we're all gonna die.<eos> Us?
- Why?<eos> - I fired them.<eos> When?<eos> This morning.<eos> Why?
This field won't harvest itself.<eos> ♪ For now... TERESA; I do like this.<eos> - What'? Walking to work with you every morning.<eos> When I suggested it, I thought you'd resist.<eos> Why'?
No, no! No, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> We were enrolled in the clinical drug trials, and they were halted during the government shutdown.<eos> We need Congress to get NIH to restore funding, and some of us don't have a lot of time.<eos> Meaning?<eos> Me.
So, what kind of bugs?<eos> Oh, they're highly invasive, and they cause personality changes.<eos> Their Latin name is something something hominivorax, which means "eater of man."<eos> Really?<eos> Eater of man?
- Oh, big surprise there!<eos> - Step off, Mom, I swear...<eos> - Marta! Izzy! - Please!<eos> I got the biggest pitch of my damn life tomorrow.<eos> Gencoin?
Yeah, but there has to be a reason why people aren't buying.<eos> Like, you're the only one.<eos> I think it's a, sort of, inclination to be afraid of what you don't know or understand, and I think it's people scared of the future.<eos> Okay, I don't really understand what exactly it is.<eos> - Gencoin?
There's no telling what they'll do.<eos> So, yeah, in this world, there are two kinds of people.<eos> The animals and the Logans.<eos> I trust him with my life.<eos> More than Mitch?
We've all been through a lot.<eos> What do you think about her pal, Logan?<eos> I don't think I trust him.<eos> Or Shaw, for that matter.<eos> Or me?
Damn.<eos> Damn, damn! You have to call someone.<eos> Tell them Fish is on her way.<eos> Call who?<eos> The Feds?
All we need to do is start one.<eos> There must have been some mistake.<eos> We don't make mistakes.<eos> I've always done whatever the Court has asked of me.<eos> Even against my own interest.
I'm saying that at this point in his training, you're faster than Barry.<eos> You're faster than Barry, you're faster than Barry, you're faster than Barry!<eos> - We got to tell everyone.<eos> - Not a good idea.<eos> - Why not?
Said that she was bringing it back to you?<eos> Well, are you okay?<eos> Are the girls?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why?
Thought it might be nice to take the twins.<eos> Yeah.<eos> They would love that.<eos> Seline.<eos> Hey, you two.
A century like that, you harden your heart and your mind till you're made of stone.<eos> But... you're not.<eos> You're kind.<eos> And you are loving.<eos> Thanks to you.
Oh!<eos> Let me help take your jackets off.<eos> I'm afraid we're not gonna be able to stay very long.<eos> What?<eos> Why?
Looks like it.<eos> But the only way to know for sure is to get you into the next shindig.<eos> Which hand stamp guy told me...<eos> Right before he passed out... Is happening as we speak.<eos> Me? Uh-huh.
Lucifer, you can't just steal food<eos> - in the middle of the precinct. - Why?<eos> Are you gonna put me on the naughty step, so I can have a think about what I've done?<eos> Hey, Monkey.<eos> Yes, yeah, I-I'm really sorry.
The most important place, first, is the kitchen.<eos> We got bagels over here if you want them.<eos> Interrogation's that way... and the lab is that way.<eos> Are you John Decker's daughter?<eos> I-I'm so sorry.
Yeah, former assistants.<eos> Both beautiful young women, like Maddie.<eos> Oh, and look at the contract that they sign when students join Soul Depot.<eos> "I surrender myself to Soul Depot, body, mind and soul, and to the only true guru of health and serenity,<eos> Jenson Glory." Wow.
Hey, does the, uh, this pocket watch mean anything to you, Nazi-relic wise?<eos> No. Sorry.<eos> Hey, another body just dropped.<eos> Aaron, we're gonna have to call you back, bud.<eos> Ready?
Just let me tie this off real quick.<eos> All right!<eos> So...<eos> what brings you to the City of...<eos> Angels?
- Come on. We can pick something up on the way to school.<eos> No, I want to.<eos> Meals are supposed to be the best time to bond with your kids, right?<eos> Sorry.<eos> Me too.
Let's do it again without locking the swords.<eos> But that is the most compelling part of the scene.<eos> It's not about the swords, it's about my eyes.<eos> Historical accuracy is also semi-important.<eos> We ready here?
Don't tell me you're going to ignore children's wishes.<eos> Wow!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Wait!<eos> Friend A!
And did you? Get them killed?<eos> Not on purpose.<eos> So what are you going to do back in New York?<eos> I got a job working construction.<eos> Construction?
I don't know anyone like that.<eos> I do.<eos> How did it go?<eos> Swell. She'll ace it.<eos> Oh, thanks to Thomas.
- Sheriff Torrance? - Yes.<eos> Special Agent Ryan Kane.<eos> - Hi. - Hi.<eos> Look, I'm sorry I wasn't able to meet with you the other day.<eos> Me too.
I just...<eos> I need to clear my head.<eos> I thought riding cleared your head.<eos> My dad used to take this pill after my mom died. It starts with a K or a... like, a C.<eos> - Clonazepam?
I promise.<eos> And I want you to give me whatever pills you got on you.<eos> All right, you take him.<eos> You've never hesitated to take a shot before.<eos> Why now?
- I called Anne.<eos> - Oh, God damn it, Helen.<eos> And apparently, this is a pattern for Philip and...<eos> - Why are you doing this?<eos> - Why?
Sure, right.<eos> I want to show Brady one of the bells, so he can tell us if it's real.<eos> No, absolutely not.<eos> The last thing we need is to tell a cop about the bells.<eos> - Not a cop, my husband.
In which case, it's just her internal system that's shut down.<eos> Hopefully.<eos> It'll be all right.<eos> We want to speak with Doctor Morrow.<eos> Certainly, Detective.
Come on.<eos> Mia, come here.<eos> Come here.<eos> I trusted him.<eos> Who?
He told me he was a friend.<eos> Someone's coming.<eos> It's good to see you.<eos> Maybe you can talk some sense into these two.<eos> Why?
And after our idyllic summer?<eos> We... we figure it out.<eos> Together.<eos> I like the together bit.<eos> Me, too.
- You ever get fucked?<eos> - No.<eos> Not even before you transitioned?<eos> No. How about you?<eos> - Why not?
I miss you."<eos> No, no, that... But, yeah. It mean, it means that she's thinking about you, so that's... that's good.<eos> Most "derfinitely."<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - No, why sorry?
- Oh, my God. - Yeah.<eos> He never knew how you felt. No, and I-I came here tonight to give him this letter and then...<eos> What happened?<eos> I met you.<eos> Oh, right. - Me.
I'm your social worker.<eos> So... so what... you're saying is... that...<eos> We're just trying to understand.<eos> Marcy?<eos> Marce?
Now there is you... again.<eos> And I never want another man.<eos> But one forced himself on me using every man who came before to justify it.<eos> And he's made me feel... cheap and disgusting and... unworthy.<eos> Hey. Of me?
Stuck in hospital, forgotten, head injuries. It's René, isn't it?<eos> Perhaps.<eos> Forget about Harry for the minute.<eos> Will this help you?<eos> You.
And why didn't we?<eos> Good question.<eos> Start talking.<eos> When we were children, we were taken from our home planet, along with over a hundred of our people, subjected to an experiment on board that ship.<eos> What kind of experiment?
Look, you don't understand.<eos> I can't stay.<eos> Me being here, I'm putting you in danger.<eos> Their powers have grown since you left.<eos> Mostly because of you.
It's like drowning in an ocean of a thousand voices.<eos> You can't block them out.<eos> So they give you the drugs to make it easier.<eos> Well, it also helps the Seers access their subconscious minds, and link them to the collective.<eos> "Seers"?
The "screw you" of it all.<eos> "Face the fear.<eos> Take back the night."<eos> I never would've thought you'd have it in you.<eos> Me?
Okay, calm down.<eos> It's just a joke.<eos> I said I'd help out.<eos> Help who out?<eos> A friend.
Come on.<eos> You're gonna love this.<eos> Hey, you get your paper in?<eos> I did.<eos> No thanks to you.
Know that we feel blessed and honored that you chose to join us too.<eos> Hear me loud and clear.<eos> We do not tolerate weaklings or quitters.<eos> This is hard-core, you dumb...<eos> Goddesses.
I was taking care of my dad.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Is he...? - ...okay?<eos> - No, he died.<eos> - Oh, my God.
That's a biggie. That's good.<eos> It's a little out of town.<eos> And some kind of play test deal for a company called Saitoo...<eos> Saitogoo...<eos> - SaitoGemu?
Hey, do you want to hear something interesting?<eos> Gosh, you've hyped it up, haven't you?<eos> Last time I was at the hospital my gran died.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Awkward for you.
'So, what brings you to London?<eos> '<eos> A need to see justice done. My mine has begun to prosper.<eos> It was your loan which enabled me to keep it open till we struck tin.<eos> My loan?
She responded in the ambo.<eos> Just slid back into overdose.<eos> All right, let's move her.<eos> On my count.<eos> Ready?
Do you know why you won?<eos> That little trick. The same one, right?<eos> Don't be an idiot.<eos> You know why you lost, Pablo?<eos> - Why? - Hmm?
To asphyxiate him.<eos> That's the Cali cartel's strategy?<eos> To keep making money while the rest of us go hungry?<eos> -You know we can't trust them. -No.<eos> Not them or any of you.
So... do you feel a year older or what?<eos> More like four or five.<eos> We've missed you very much, Pablo.<eos> The days feel longer.<eos> For me too.
Like I said, it is the best M car BMW has ever made.<eos> You may think it's mad to suggest the cheapest M car is the best, but look at it this way, this track is a lot cheaper than Silverstone.<eos> And I know which one I'd rather drive round.<eos> Go drive an M2.<eos> Unbelievable.
Thank you for coming.<eos> My wife.<eos> Don Salvatore, a pleasure.<eos> - The godmother.<eos> - A pleasure.
And I like my things.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Mom?<eos> - Hmm? What if I paid you to clean off one surface in your house?<eos> - Just one.
_<eos> All right, cool.<eos> This shit is wack as fuck!<eos> Ah, come on, man. It ain't all that bad.<eos> Why, man?
I don't need your help.<eos> We're done.<eos> Well, Francie's breathing normally again.<eos> She's gonna be okay.<eos> Thanks to you.
Happy to be here.<eos> Hey, something I can help you with, Mr. Meachum?<eos> Is Sergeant Swagger under you command or is he sort of a superstar free agent?<eos> Gunnery Sergeant Swagger reports to me.<eos> - Why?
I will walk out of here with you without a fight, do you hear me?<eos> I sympathize, Jackson, I do, but I'm afraid your mother is a lost cause.<eos> Botswana has all but fallen.<eos> So I suggest that you focus on the people that you can help.<eos> Namely your team.
- Together.<eos> - Are you kidding me?<eos> We get out of this plane.<eos> We'll go back to South Beach.<eos> Any beach, okay?
Ginger's got a mean right.<eos> Jamie,<eos> I tried to give you an out twice.<eos> I thought you would've learned your lesson in Caraquet.<eos> Why?
- Okay, so, we're going all the way to Helsinki to meet a quack?<eos> Oh, not just any quack.<eos> This particular quack is a raging alcoholic, pathological hypocrite, a straight-up cradle robber... and he's also my dad.<eos> They're hunting me.<eos> - But why?
Just tell me which way to go next.<eos> Okay, uh, Jamie, we just turned onto a street called, uh,<eos> Ra-Rakuun... something.<eos> I don't know, there's too many vowels in this language.<eos> Rakuunantie.
I mean... it's nothing now.<eos> It's stilted conversations and avoiding eye contact.<eos> And he said no?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> To you?
Twenty-five percent profit in 60 days.<eos> Are you really gonna walk away from that?<eos> What's the obstacle here, Gallagher?<eos> I promised Etta Tesdale a place to live if she sold me her lease.<eos> Who?
Let's see how this one looks on you, my love.<eos> I think it's a real diamond.<eos> Wow. I wonder how much Raoul's gonna give us for it.<eos> We can't sell this.<eos> Why not?
It's the other...<eos> Do I tell you how to do EMT shit?<eos> - I just...<eos> - Leave the goddamn stealing<eos> - to the experts.
Go get changed.<eos> I think that's the last of it.<eos> This isn't your apartment, Sandy.<eos> Well, I, I moved.<eos> Why?
What are you gonna do with the place?<eos> What, the building?<eos> Why?<eos> Never mind.<eos> Why?
Uh, count to five.<eos> If that doesn't work, get out of there, remove yourself from the situation.<eos> So, on a scale of lots to nothing, how much would you say you knew about my brother when you guys got married?<eos> I'm not getting in the middle of that.<eos> Why?
Hey, Rochelle, I'm sending you a photo of some pills.<eos> Can you tell me what they're for?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> But I think you should get over here.<eos> Why?
We can contradict Red.<eos> Not without breaking confidentiality.<eos> Well, then we get Ella, and the three of us censure Red.<eos> I don't think that'll work.<eos> Why?
[ Sniffles ] I'll be fine.<eos> Saving this hospital wasn't about me.<eos> It was about helping people with nowhere else to go.<eos> We did that today.<eos> Thanks to you.
How's it going on the fuselage?<eos> Uh, yeah, it's going.<eos> You haven't seen this guy, have you?<eos> Not yet.<eos> Why?
Yeah, I know.<eos> I woke up at 11:30 with Joe screaming at me.<eos> - Word?<eos> - Yeah, he was pretty mad.<eos> Why?
- Yeah, so F'd.<eos> Yeah, for some reason, I thought there'd be stuff in here to help us get home, not a sex swing.<eos> We need to find out who this pervert is.<eos> What?<eos> Why?
How did this happen?<eos> Well, after the crash, we landed out here.<eos> Food ran out about five days ago, and things went bad fast.<eos> I'm never gonna let this country jackass make a meal out of me.<eos> - Jackass?
Having second thoughts?<eos> No need for that, dearie.<eos> Tell me... why didn't you poison Snow White and Prince Charming?<eos> I was prepared to poison them, but... I saw Charlotte, and she reminded me of...<eos> Your fiancée?
Uh, it's a dangerous game... Even for the good cops.<eos> But you were out there.<eos> You were right there, for Christ's sake.<eos> Have you said anything?<eos> To whom?
You can expect charges of mutiny, sedition, aiding the enemy, and espionage, and each one carries the death penalty.<eos> I already told you what happened!<eos> The antimatter we actually created amounted to only a fraction of what we thought.<eos> I think you sold it!<eos> What?
Our way of life.<eos> Our lives themselves.<eos> The brave soldiers who made the ultimate sacrifice for this great nation.<eos> On behalf of the queen, I dedicate this beautiful park as a living monument to their selfless,<eos> heroic actions.
So I harshed you.<eos> But you're right.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I miss her so much.<eos> Me too.
Hey! You were the one who came to Gutterie begging him to put you on the stand.<eos> What the hell happened up there?<eos> What kind of game are you playing?<eos> I thought you cared about the truth.<eos> Justice.
And then he goes and he tells her that-that I was jealous.<eos> So, tell her the truth.<eos> Come on, man.<eos> Who's she gonna believe?<eos> Me or dear old dad?
Not just any bird.<eos> In ancient mythology, the Phoenix rose from the ashes stronger than it ever was.<eos> That's us.<eos> I like it.<eos> Me, too.
Yeah, get his jacket.<eos> No...<eos> Take your jacket off.<eos> Come on, everyone, let's hear it for him!<eos> Why?
You were there.<eos> They did say it was just an accident, though.<eos> They evacuated the area in time, and no one was hurt.<eos> Marcy. Marcy.<eos> Marce?
What is it, Valentine?<eos> About six months ago, I was going over numbers for the program... and the loss incidence for weapons was being underreported.<eos> And who did you bring this to?<eos> A friend at the DOJ.<eos> And Rob.
You don't have to like me, but... you can trust me.<eos> I promise.<eos> Nothing I can think of.<eos> Well, if you won't tell me, maybe you can confide in one of your teammates.<eos> Weller, perhaps?
Because I want you to know what I'm capable of when I tell you that when I find my father, I'm coming for you.<eos> Well, I suppose that settles that, then.<eos> Don't move.<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah. Thanks to you.
Tip went out as of this morning.<eos> I wonder how many misfires there have been since we started this.<eos> First wave was upwards of 30%. Wow!<eos> Nobody told me that. Yeah.<eos> Me neither.
Bye!<eos> I know it goes against your instincts... but don't waste any more energy trying to get free from your restraints.<eos> It's not gonna happen.<eos> Hello?<eos> Marce?
I woke up in an empty room and they brought me here.<eos> I don't even know how long I was there.<eos> Hours?<eos> Wait. Are you hurt?<eos> Thanks to John Hentrick, no.
April's in charge, obviously.<eos> You're sworn to protect me.<eos> And that's why I'm locking you in, Prince.<eos> It's so you won't come to any harm.<eos> Why?
- Karen.<eos> Vice president.<eos> Man, I feel so sorry for Pack.<eos> Oh, I know.<eos> Me, too, for sure.
I didn't know you can propose to the same person so many times.<eos> The third time, I did it in skywriting, but she never looked up.<eos> You know, once, I proposed to him.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why?
Yeah, my father was a victim of the Silver Bells Killer but they're closing in on the guy now, finally.<eos> That is good news.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It does feel like the killer could be someone close to us, which is really freaking me out, honestly.<eos> Honestly, me, too.
I remember looking out the window with Trudy, watching the Japanese tanks rolling down the Embarcadero.<eos> How did she get here?<eos> Into the Reich.<eos> I don't want to talk about Trudy.<eos> Why not?
I told you about the counterfeiting.<eos> That's all I know.<eos> The Yakuza's dealings are of particular interest to us.<eos> You think they are going to tell me anything?<eos> A gaijin?
Prescribed by Dr. Christina Morales.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> - Calling Lieutenant Craig.<eos> - Why?
Or is that what's making you sick?<eos> We got to get you back to Warren and Sun Mei.<eos> They'll know what to do.<eos> You can't tell Warren about the bite.<eos> Not anybody.
- What?<eos> - Duck down now.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Marce?
We heard something happened to him.<eos> It's important that you tell us what it was.<eos> Buddy died.<eos> My bird.<eos> - Sorry, ma'am.
I was building the Tesla tower, and then the world started to end.<eos> And Bob Black said he needed to be on the air, and he's the most godlike guy I ever met, ever.<eos> So I put him on the air because people need a godlike guy at a time like this.<eos> Sorry for the lie, but I have to protect the Moondog.<eos> Why?
If you're lucky, you'll pass out from the pain first.<eos> Burn in hell, Karen.<eos> Hey, wait, don't...<eos> Don't turn the basement power off.<eos> - Why?
Do you want me to tell you?<eos> Yes.<eos> Okay, I will.<eos> Did you ever learn how to surf?<eos> No, why?
Yeah, that is our hope too.<eos> Yeah, well, if, if that works for you.<eos> Great.<eos> So our head of security will be at the hotel to meet your people when... when they arrive.<eos> You too.
- What? !<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I get, like, a runny nose.<eos> You gave me a Claritin?<eos> ! Why?
-Things like that. -Well, it looked to me as though he did.<eos> I was about to go up to him when he spotted her.<eos> It seemed like he was looking for her.<eos> That's what I told the other detective.<eos> -What other detective?
If you really have nothing to hide, then you should do what any upstanding citizen would do.<eos> Call your local sheriff.<eos> [Billy] You know, you can't make me go here.<eos> - You need help. - Why?<eos> Why?
We both should care.<eos> I torched Joey's entire stash, and when I did, he was scared for his life.<eos> Clearly, he had good reason to be.<eos> I think whoever killed him may be coming after Hector next.<eos> Why?
You know anything about him?<eos> [Mathias] Well, by the looks of things, I'm thinking he didn't have a girlfriend.<eos> [Walt] Have any enemies?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Me.
I'd like to be raped by Bill Cosby.<eos> 'Cause I've been such a big fan of his for so many years, it would just be wonderful to meet him.<eos> How else would I get to meet him, you know?<eos> Of course, you know, we're in the same business.<eos> Comedy.
Yeah, tell him my sister likes him? - Okay.<eos> - All right.<eos> - Here's a pair of her underwear. - Whoa.<eos> - Give it to Paper Boi.<eos> - Why? No.
Why are you following me, Vic?<eos> A better question is, what the hell are you doing out on the Res?<eos> Meeting Malachi.<eos> Here?<eos> Why?
Yeah.<eos> I haven't forgotten that.<eos> Has he asked you to provide any legal assistance to, uh, someone that's been operating outside of Reservation law?<eos> What?<eos> Like who?
I haven't forgotten that.<eos> Has he asked you to provide any legal assistance to, uh, someone that's been operating outside of Reservation law?<eos> What?<eos> Like who?<eos> Hector.
♪ ♪ Hey. I got your message.<eos> - Thanks for coming. - Yeah.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I had Detective Lau's body exhumed.<eos> What? Why?
- Jasper.<eos> - Can I go and see the princess again?<eos> Fine.<eos> Go. Give your friend the caterpillar a rest.<eos> Jasper.
You handle I.T. for the office?<eos> I handle I.T. when they let me handle I.T.<eos> More often, they just bitch and bitch and bitch.<eos> You handle I.T. for all the senator offices?<eos> Yeah. Why?
You handle I.T. for all the senator offices?<eos> Yeah. Why?<eos> SRB-54, the basement offices?<eos> All the senate offices.<eos> Why?
She's probably right, but I need to get in good shape.<eos> Right.<eos> Aren't you gonna ask me why?<eos> Yes. I'm sorry.<eos> Why?
No.<eos> Maybe?<eos> I guess.<eos> Look, I'm really sorry about everything that's happened or didn't happen between us.<eos> Me too.
You can, Eleanor.<eos> Thanks, Real Eleanor.<eos> Hey, if you two aren't gonna make out, just shut up.<eos> Look, if you don't come with us, we're gonna have to turn this matter over to Shawn.<eos> Oh, oh, no, um, Shawn, really?
Warren!<eos> Addy!<eos> Doc!<eos> Doc!<eos> Hey, you guys!

What are you talking about?<eos> The only person who has the power to put pressure on an asshole like Nathan Burns is a bigger asshole, and you said it yourself, William Sutter will do anything to get what he wants.<eos> Donna, I need you to get Bill Johnson at Goldman, and I need you to do it right now.<eos> - I can't.<eos> - Why the hell not?
- Developed by who?<eos> - My son-in-law.<eos> Good, then we can give it to Cahill, 'cause he just subpoenaed it.<eos> - No, we can't.<eos> - Why the hell not?
I know you're both picturing it involved fantastic sex.<eos> - Nope. - Not a bit.<eos> In any event, Tara and I have a date on Friday night, and I'm hoping it ends with our souls merging as one.<eos> - And I'm out.<eos> - What? Why?
What's your daughter's name?<eos> You have to tell me about your doggy.<eos> What?<eos> That's quite the little charmer you've got there.<eos> Yeah, thanks to Emma.
Use a paper towel to wipe up the excess oil and do the same thing on the other side.<eos> It will be crispy but fluffy.<eos> The perfect grilled cheese sandwich.<eos> - Are we done here?<eos> - Why?
I got to say, this... This is all so weird.<eos> I mean, I'm a medical professional, not some Raymond Chandler character.<eos> You want to help this Jaclyn or not?<eos> - What?<eos> - Your lady.
We're late.<eos> That guy was in the bar.<eos> Yes, he was.<eos> Good get.<eos> So, why?
You just gave him a fucking hard-ass stare.<eos> Were you aware of that?<eos> I was not.<eos> He thinks we're a damn team.<eos> Killers on the road.
Just a couple texts, saying that I loved him and I was proud of him.<eos> Did he seemed worried or agitated lately?<eos> No.<eos> I mean, I was.<eos> Why?
- Well, you got ten hours.<eos> And it's got to trace back to Oliver Tuxhorn himself.<eos> Check this out.<eos> Tuxhorn's lawyers got payments in to a P.I....<eos> Jim Radovick.
Fucked me up the arse.<eos> I used to manage a bar, and I... just found her crying, in the toilet one night.<eos> How about you two?<eos> How did you two meet?<eos> Through our mother, actually.
Who, Oracle, who?<eos> Neither of you understands what's happening here, okay?<eos> I did one foolish thing, I get pregnant, and now my punishment is that I can't have sex until the baby's born.<eos> Well, a newborn is an awful lot of work.<eos> Fine. Two years old.
I did one foolish thing, I get pregnant, and now my punishment is that I can't have sex until the baby's born.<eos> Well, a newborn is an awful lot of work.<eos> Fine. Two years old.<eos> Well, at two, they're potty training, running around everywhere, ting on furniture.<eos> Five! Five!
What...<eos> I was... drowning.<eos> There was water.<eos> That's right, you were on a boat.<eos> A refugee boat.
- Hey, Ming!<eos> - Hey, Batou!<eos> - Got your bones. - Thanks man.<eos> - What are they for?<eos> - For the dogs.
Everything you witnessed went to Section 9 to evaluate.<eos> You know, the scan... also turned up the number of glitches.<eos> They've been getting worse.<eos> Since when?<eos> Since the deep dive.
Nothing on Kuze yet, sir.<eos> Checking upper zones next.<eos> Is there any word on Major?<eos> She's gone.<eos> Off-grid.
You're gonna piss me off.<eos> What's it like down there?<eos> It's cold and dark.<eos> Just a million miles away.<eos> No voices.
It's cold and dark.<eos> Just a million miles away.<eos> No voices.<eos> No data streaming.<eos> Just... nothing.
Please come and sit, yeah?<eos> What happened to her?<eos> I don't know.<eos> The Ministry sent me her ashes, and... they told me she took her own life.<eos> But Motoko...
I don't know.<eos> Wait, wait, wait!<eos> Will you come again to visit me?<eos> I will.<eos> Aramaki.
Well, if you won't do it for me, do it for Gibbons.<eos> Your country needs you, Mr. Cage.<eos> The Triple-X program needs you.<eos> It's time to be a patriot.<eos> By whose definition?
So, which are you?<eos> I'm Triple-X.<eos> Well, welcome back, Triple-X.<eos> Uh, where are you going?<eos> - London. - Why?
Nobody knows I'm here.<eos> And you know how I am about keeping secrets.<eos> So you say, but Interpol's got these new listening bugs.<eos> They're practically invisible.<eos> Real MI6 kind of shit.
Never really think about it.<eos> Kumquat.<eos> What about you?<eos> No. "Safe" isn't in my vocabulary.<eos> Touche.
Hey, get back here!<eos> Wassup, Nyjah?<eos> Lightning-bolt and Burrito.<eos> Chad, wassup, bro?<eos> Roberta.
All we need to do is track down the main signal, and then we can approximate its location within a 20-mile radius.<eos> Of all the places in the world to lay low, this fruit loop chooses Detroit?<eos> These blasts did take place in Moscow, but they were felt around the world.<eos> Good morning. As feared, the death toll in the Moscow tragedy is rising.<eos> In addition to the latest deaths--
And when Becky locks in his exact location, we make our move.<eos> What about you?<eos> How did you get roped into all this?<eos> I tagged a skyscraper and got a year in jail for it.<eos> Jail?
He said a lion like me doesn't belong in any kind of cage.<eos> I got mine after I left the NSA.<eos> What about that one on your wrist?<eos> London.<eos> 2009.
Twelve round mag.<eos> Five left.<eos> Three.<eos> What the hell's going on out there?<eos> Empty.
Think I could've been FBI?<eos> Couldn't do any worse than these assholes.<eos> Yeah. Thanks, man.<eos> Did you see anything at the Burton place last night?<eos> Nothing but phantom naked school boys.
So maybe they chopped the money then and there, and then went their separate ways.<eos> Or maybe they left two trails to confuse us.<eos> I don't even see how it matters.<eos> Well, you'll see that it matters when we find my brother Andy's dead body, you stupid assholes.<eos> Oh!
- Don't be stupid, then.<eos> - What should we do?<eos> - Check the radio.<eos> Are you fucking kidding me?<eos> You dipshit! The news!
Robbing banks isn't exactly straight and narrow.<eos> Then why are you doing it?<eos> - That's a stupid fucking question.<eos> - Why are you doing it?<eos> - For you.
You don't want to skip school and spend the day with your dad?<eos> - Can Lissa come? - No, Lissa can't come.<eos> No, it's just you and me.<eos> That's the. Melissa is her imaginary friend.<eos> Lissa, yeah, sure.
- Do you mind hopping' in back?<eos> - No, not at all.<eos> - Hey, Ed.<eos> - How's it going, Reed?<eos> The back, huh?
- Oh, yeah. Yes, yeah. Westmoreland.<eos> That was the game that Coach Denton called Reed's goal line play on fourth and one, except we weren't on the goal line.<eos> Yeah, it was an important play.<eos> And I dropped back, and I tossed a pretty little daisy<eos> - right in your waiting mitt.
- Zeke?<eos> - Back here!<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> 019. Come in.<eos> - Shit! Oh, shit!
So, Francie, today's bride, is my oldest friend.<eos> Oh... Thank you!<eos> There's been a long discussion about what kind of table this is and you've just resolved it!<eos> She is the best friend of the bride.<eos> Well, oldest.
Why did you make Facebook friends with Henry Grotsky on Facebook?<eos> You answered with a question.<eos> Why are you looking at my Facebook?<eos> Actually, with Henry Grotsky and Tom Fo.<eos> Tom Fo?
No.<eos> She doesn't want to dance.<eos> Maybe I should have a word with her actual father?<eos> He's not here.<eos> Same with mine.
Goodbye.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> I should just let you know that I've got a little bit of eczema behind my knees.<eos> And, um, oh, last year I had a cold sore, but that was because Jalapeno was using my washcloth.<eos> And not just on his face.
Oh, Fo, yes.<eos> I said Tom Fo. "Ls there a Tom Fo here?", I said.<eos> And he said...<eos> He said, "No."<eos> Okay. Right.
- Should I come back... - No, no.<eos> Oatmeal with...<eos> I'll take with with reduced fat almond.<eos> Oh, let me guess, you only have wholemeal? - From the Outer?<eos> - No, from AMP.
- Polo.<eos> Don't move.<eos> Okay, I'm sorry. Go ahead.<eos> He wants what?<eos> Primary custody?
I'm here, Frankie!<eos> What do you want?<eos> No!<eos> What do you people want?<eos> Money?
How long is that gonna take?<eos> They'll be there very soon.<eos> I just need you to stay on the line with me, okay?<eos> Okay. - Is that gonna be like 5 minutes?<eos> - Between 7-15 minutes, ma'am.
You will feel it.<eos> You speak very harshly to him.<eos> Braver than the others.<eos> I have some things I need to ask.<eos> What things?
Knew her moods, her needs.<eos> Oh... how I loved her.<eos> Jakob, was it you?<eos> If it was, then all you've done is tell me you're afraid.<eos> Ja...
What is it?<eos> You wish to leave?<eos> Jakob?<eos> Lucia.<eos> Ugolina.
Jakob?<eos> Lucia.<eos> Ugolina.<eos> Angelica.<eos> La signora Malvina.
Signore.<eos> There's a story about that cat.<eos> It was the custom amongst those building houses such as this to... to seal a cat within the walls as a protection against evil.<eos> - A dead cat? - No.<eos> Not dead.
See how it fits, huh?<eos> Brava.<eos> Bellisima.<eos> Ah, perfetto.<eos> Bellisima.
I must speak to Jakob.<eos> Jakob.<eos> The boy will speak... when the time is right.<eos> Help me.<eos> Help.
All right, all right. Keep it down. Keep it down, people.<eos> It's so beautiful.<eos> I'm in heteronormative hell.<eos> Okay, okay, let's hope third time's the charm.<eos> Sisyphus.
And you... You're just pathetic.<eos> You know what? We'd rather be bitches than a psycho.<eos> Yeah, psycho.<eos> Have you noticed that nobody likes you?<eos> - Yeah, psycho. - Psycho.
Juliet...<eos> You know what? We'd rather be bitches than a psycho.<eos> Yeah, psycho.<eos> Have you noticed that nobody likes you?<eos> - Yeah, psycho.
I will kill you in your sleep.<eos> 12:39.<eos> I wonder what filter Terri uses on her photos.<eos> Major FOMO.<eos> Such a loser.
What are you wearing?<eos> Funny.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Jeez, wake up on the wrong side of the bed or something?<eos> For a few days now, yep.
Don't say it.<eos> I'm in heteronormative hell.<eos> Okay, thank you. Thank you, girls.<eos> Okay, okay, let's hope third time's the charm. Okay?<eos> Sisyphus.
Sisyphus, not an STD.<eos> Sorry, it was an emergency and a tribulation.<eos> A minor LaserJet explosion.<eos> Val-a-gram delivery.<eos> Happy Cupid Day.
Our dearest friend in all the world.<eos> We would have to be sure about this.<eos> Think carefully because...<eos> We'd have to be very sure.<eos> Absolutely no sound during the morning.
It's just outside, just there.<eos> It's impossible.<eos> I need your help now, or the fear will be unmanageable.<eos> God bless you, Dr. Zabiński.<eos> Goodbye for now.
I'm looking for my husband.<eos> He was captured by German troops.<eos> He was taken from the zoo?<eos> No.<eos> From Old Town.
I don't know anything.<eos> And what gift would I receive in return?<eos> I'm curious to know.<eos> Has Jan been keeping secrets from me?<eos> No, of course not.
Good breed. Easy to train.<eos> You got something smaller?<eos> I got some cute yorkies over here.<eos> -Oh. -I got this Japanese chin.<eos> -Ah! -Uh, poodle.
I'm so sorry.<eos> It's all my fault.<eos> Eventhough Icouldn'tseehim ,<eos> IknewEthan wasverysadthatnight.<eos> Hey, boy.
- Yeah. I'm sorry.<eos> Sure you got everything?<eos> Just let her talk to me.<eos> Just get in the car, dad. I got it.<eos> Fromthatmomenton,
Let's hear it for this guy!<eos> You don't have to do this right now, dad.<eos> Come on! Come on, huh?<eos> Would you stop this?<eos> Hey. All right.
Would you stop this?<eos> Hey. All right.<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> Want your burger?<eos> For Bailey?
Hey. All right.<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> Want your burger?<eos> For Bailey?<eos> Hey, boss dog.
Ellie.<eos> Ellie.<eos> Find.<eos> Find, Ellie.<eos> Good find. Pretzel.
- Come on, get up!<eos> Come on.<eos> This is canine unit k-27.<eos> I'm gonna need immediate...<eos> Assistance.
You don't want to have to be the ones to cart poor old...<eos> Wilson to the hospital when he conks out.<eos> Get out while the going's good.<eos> Smart move!<eos> Holy shit.
That's twelve dollars?<eos> Oh, I know. It is a total racket.<eos> They know that pet owners are all damaged and neurotic and we will... happily throw our money at the most nonsensical crap just to... buy a little affection.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, no shit.<eos> No shit.
What the fuck did I ever do wrong?<eos> Get away from my car.<eos> I'm not a psycho, lady.<eos> What the heck crawled up her ass?<eos> Yeah, no kidding.
Well, my friend tried it once, but nothing.<eos> Forget it, I'm done.<eos> I'll find her.<eos> What's her name?<eos> Pippi.
I'll find her.<eos> What's her name?<eos> Pippi.<eos> My ex?<eos> Pippi.
Shit. I wasn't... I wasn't supposed to drink.<eos> Can this really be the same Pippi who used to... smoke and drink and curse and fart and belch?<eos> She was a disgusting pig.<eos> Well, there was never a dull moment, that's for sure.<eos> Pippi?
When I talked to you on the phone... I pictured some guy with an Army buddy on the force... He gets all his info from a blind guy on the corner...<eos> Nope.<eos> Nope.<eos> Where the hell's that goddamn file?<eos> Cocksucker!
I'm not talking about anything major, Pippi.<eos> I mean... don't you want to see her in the flesh?<eos> What are you saying now?<eos> What do you want to do, stalk her?<eos> Holy Christ, Pippi.
I told you.<eos> I just want to get a glimpse of her.<eos> But you just saw her!<eos> Get down!<eos> Down, down. Shit.
I just want to get a glimpse of her.<eos> But you just saw her!<eos> Get down!<eos> Down, down. Shit.<eos> Okay, up, up.
She certainly doesn't need any help from us.<eos> It's like she has that miserable, anguished look... like you had when I first met you.<eos> Of course, you turned out okay.<eos> In the long run.<eos> Oh, Pippi.
It's like she has that miserable, anguished look... like you had when I first met you.<eos> Of course, you turned out okay.<eos> In the long run.<eos> Oh, Pippi.<eos> Oh, Pippi!
Monika the bitch.<eos> Monika?<eos> Monika.<eos> Now, is there like a creepy teacher or janitor or...?<eos> Mr. Naisbitt.
You know, that's...<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yeah. You're a wise man.<eos> Nice cock, by the way.<eos> Pippi?
And then she has Pippi's sarcastic laugh and... my temper.<eos> I mean, DNA, it's just... it's truly unbelievable.<eos> Coop's heading to Duke in the fall.<eos> It's hard to believe.<eos> Coops!
You're cool.<eos> They went for a walk.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Pippi.
Fuck you!<eos> Get away from me, Pippi! Oh, oh, oh!<eos> Stop it!<eos> Pippi! I'm getting fucking tired of this bullshit!<eos> No, Pippi!
Just don't say anything.<eos> Polly!<eos> It's called kidnapping!<eos> Sit down.<eos> Pippi?
Whose side are you on?<eos> Don't worry.<eos> We'll let them cool down and then we'll work something out.<eos> You got a clean record.<eos> What about Pippi?
There's more pieces than there is puzzle left.<eos> These are that color and there ain't no blanks in that color.<eos> Hey, Wilson!<eos> You got a visitor.<eos> A what?
But you're here now.<eos> I am.<eos> And I have to thank you, Wilson.<eos> You believed in me when nobody else ever did.<eos> Oh, Pippi.
It's so nice talking with someone who isn't fucking psychotic!<eos> You know?<eos> We got a nice long journey ahead of us.<eos> Yeah, a couple of hours. Yeah.<eos> "Cyndi's Cupcakery?"
What are you?<eos> Death.<eos> Jack Sparrow.<eos> Do you know this pirate?<eos> - Only by name.
No, no.<eos> No need to fear me boy.<eos> I always leave one man alive, to tell the tale.<eos> Find Sparrow for me and relay a message from Capitán Salazar.<eos> Salazar.
Am I a witch for having catalogued over 200 stars? - Witch!<eos> There's a Bloodmoon coming.<eos> I simply need to purchase a chronometer.<eos> I pay you double for selling to a woman.<eos> Help!
There's a Bloodmoon coming.<eos> I simply need to purchase a chronometer.<eos> I pay you double for selling to a woman.<eos> Help!<eos> Help!
I've heard stories of a mighty Spanish captain.<eos> El Matador Del Mar.<eos> A man who scourged the sea, hunted and killed thousands of men.<eos> No-no-no.<eos> Men, no.
This boy...<eos> This boy was mocking my power.<eos> So I chased him, knowing that I would run my knife along his neck and when he was dead, I would finish, finally, with the pirates's life.<eos> Follow him in!<eos> To the gallows!
Scabies, I'm talking about scabies.<eos> Small mites that burrow under the skin.<eos> Certainly annoying me, has done, for years.<eos> Oh, no!<eos> Help!
Certainly annoying me, has done, for years.<eos> Oh, no!<eos> Help!<eos> - Help me!<eos> Help!
Let us begin?<eos> We'll honeymoon in the barn.<eos> No-no-no.<eos> Now, Pig, how could I honestly make an honest woman out of it?<eos> That.
Carina!<eos> Henry, look, the island is there!<eos> You found it!<eos> The island.<eos> Land!
Hector, I think you should know she's a horologist.<eos> Why isn't it glowing?<eos> Finish it, Carina.<eos> The missing star.<eos> For my father.
Director of Proprietary Trading and Codirector of Trading.<eos> Investigator: And where did the money for these loans come from?<eos> The loans that allowed you to buy your loft in SOHO, your house in Greenwich, your house in Nantucket.<eos> I assume from the money he made through investments.<eos> Investigator: On the private advisory side?
- Pop-pop! Bernie: We took a big hit today.<eos> Lost over a billion and change. You know how with a split-strike conversion strategy the stock options offset losses?<eos> Frank: It's like insurance.<eos> A fucking meltdown like this, would have been a nice strategy. If only we had it in place<eos> - before the fucking... - No ifs.

Yeah, so if anyone double-checks our trades, we got it all there. - All winners.<eos> Bernie: Make sure the books show that the London office is clearing the trades so no one upstairs in market-making is involved. Not my brother, not the boys, no one.<eos> - Understand?<eos> - Yeah, of course, of course, yeah.<eos> No one.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My team and I tried our best to get the SEC to investigate and shut down the Madoff Ponzi scheme with repeated and credible warnings to the SEC that started in May 2000.<eos> - We knew that...<eos> - Ruth.<eos> You wanna watch this Harry guy's testimony?<eos> Who?
And I can't talk to you anymore.<eos> You can't write to me or call me.<eos> It'll be too hard. Ruth, all I want is what's best for you and for the boys.<eos> Boy, Bernie.<eos> Boy.
Yes. Man: The father-son relationship is such an important factor in anyone's life.<eos> There must be some part of that relationship with your father that still exists.<eos> Even after all this, can you see some point where you could visit him or talk to him again?<eos> My father is dead to me.<eos> Diana:
The most successful female Viagra the world has ever seen.<eos> B J holds the patent.<eos> Now you have my attention.<eos> Ladies, you know it's my anniversary, so I am...<eos> - Happy anniversary.
That they're looking for an executive editor and he was wanting me to come back.<eos> For what, 120 K a year plus dental?<eos> Why bother? Well, it's not really about the money and it's...<eos> Baby, between India and China and this new deal with Howard I need... I need all your attention on me right now.<eos> All of it.
So where are we?<eos> The grand jury's being sworn and they're gonna start to hear evidence soon.<eos> - How long? - It's impossible to say at this time...<eos> - ...but you know, maybe 3 or 4 weeks.<eos> - Not good enough.
What you looking for?<eos> I was just checking to make sure this is the right place.<eos> - The right place for what?<eos> - I'm looking for a friend of mine.<eos> - Papi, who?
I was just checking to make sure this is the right place.<eos> - The right place for what?<eos> - I'm looking for a friend of mine.<eos> - Papi, who?<eos> - Bill Oakland.
I see on the road as being a little deeper than Sal just wanting to stick it up Dean's ass, yes.<eos> Darling, you can go as deep as you like.<eos> I think Kerouac's saying Dean is Christ.<eos> - Closeted!<eos> - All right, enough of this shit.
The end.<eos> I'd say that's a step up for Joey Epstein.<eos> I'd hate to see his early works.<eos> What are you reading now?<eos> Franzen.
- What the fuck is wrong with you?<eos> - Why don't you mind your own business?<eos> Why don't you get off your ass and do what you were put on this earth to do?<eos> It's time to move on.<eos> Enough with the self pity shit!
Nothing left, but the memory of the one pair of lips that could have saved your soul.<eos> If only fear hadn't kept you from taking the leap.<eos> Okay, that's great.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> - All right, bye.
What's going on?<eos> What's going on where?<eos> You've got some heat on you, Arthur.<eos> Your name keeps coming up. In what circles?<eos> My mum's sewing circle.
They speak it better than you.<eos> Hold up, hold up. Back up. Are you sure you didn't see someone else before you saw George?<eos> Morning, Art. We saw Mike.<eos> All right, Mike.<eos> Mike the Spike? Kosher Mike?
Hold up, hold up. Back up. Are you sure you didn't see someone else before you saw George?<eos> Morning, Art. We saw Mike.<eos> All right, Mike.<eos> Mike the Spike? Kosher Mike?<eos> Which Mike?
- There's no change, Mike.<eos> - See you later, Mike.<eos> - Cheers, Mike!<eos> What is this about, Jack?<eos> Rebel graffiti. A young boy.
Is it not true that this man was raised in a brothel and has no formal education of any kind?<eos> Then they'll start takin' the piss.<eos> And what are we to be called, Bedivere?<eos> "Knights of the Bordello"?<eos> Or "The Ladies of the Knight."
Tell you what the problem is, mate.<eos> When you say the building's right, I know the man that owns that building.<eos> And he's not interested in letting anyone in.<eos> How do you feel about a rooftop king assassination?<eos> - My roof? - Yeah.
Scared of the dark.<eos> Really?<eos> George, will you tell them?<eos> Sorry, boss.<eos> Weapons!
And it was beautiful, and it was difficult.<eos> And I thought I would be with him for the rest of my life.<eos> But he died.<eos> I wanted to escape from every tie.<eos> Every hold.
I'd like to hear you sing.<eos> - Okay, I gotta... - Elephant...<eos> - I gotta check another table.<eos> - Why'? Why? - 'Cause my boss is watching.<eos> - Which other table?
I'm scared.<eos> They play with sex.<eos> They make it cheap.<eos> Maybe you need this world.<eos> The falsehood, the show.
What the fuck is this?<eos> - Fuck!<eos> - Downs!<eos> Watch out!<eos> Cass!
Let's go, let's go, let's go!<eos> Come on!<eos> Hit it!<eos> What the fuck was that?<eos> Shit.
No, no, no.<eos> No, please...<eos> Come on. Let me out!<eos> Anyone!<eos> Help!
Fuck. Fuck! Fuck!<eos> You get him?<eos> No.<eos> And the product ain't here either.<eos> Shit.
Someone takes a dump in my department, I know about it.<eos> They're shittin' all over it.<eos> I'm off the books.<eos> I've been working undercover for two years...<eos> Two fuckin' years!
Oh, no, that's okay.<eos> It's probably better if you're not here.<eos> Hey, listen. The house is a real mess, especially the kitchen.<eos> Oh, I'll take care of it. I'll tell them you had guests.<eos> - Yes, really messy guests.
Well, don't be.<eos> I don't know any either.<eos> - Why do you say that?<eos> - I haven't written in a long time.<eos> Nothing good, anyway.
Fuck.<eos> Watch your step.<eos> My wife made me put these safety bolts on all windows.<eos> - She was scared, you know.<eos> - Of what?
- It counts for more than my agent's.<eos> Yeah, yes, enjoy it, man.<eos> Good afternoon.<eos> How was your nap?<eos> Not good. Not good.
Never found a crime scene until it was too late.<eos> And even then you left us nothing.<eos> Until now.<eos> We're out in the open here, Paul.<eos> No more secrets.
Full confession.<eos> I'll give you every detail of every one of the victims' remains for every crime scene, everything.<eos> I have a great memory.<eos> I wrap up your case neatly with a bright bow.<eos> But no needle.
No, yeah.<eos> Kid's got a future.<eos> Yeah, well...<eos> We'll see, I guess.<eos> No, hey...
You already quit marching band and robotics lab.<eos> I'm not obsessed with him.<eos> I'm just very observant.<eos> Flash, you're in for Peter.<eos> Oof.
Just stay away from anything too dangerous.<eos> I'm responsible for making sure you're responsible.<eos> Okay?<eos> I am responsible!<eos> Crap...
- What was that?<eos> - That's nothing!<eos> Nothing!<eos> - You're the Spider-Man.<eos> From YouTube.
Just get out.<eos> What's the matter?<eos> I thought you loved larb.<eos> It's too larby?<eos> Not larby enough.
Sorry, Peter.<eos> I guess we're still losers.<eos> I'll see you tomorrow.<eos> I'll see you tomorrow in school.<eos> Idiots.
No, no, no.<eos> God, that's weird.<eos> - What about KAREN?<eos> - You can call me KAREN if you'd like.<eos> Hey, KAREN.
- What's weird about that?<eos> What if she's expecting someone like Tony Stark?<eos> Imagine how disappointed she'd be when she sees me.<eos> Well, if I were her, I wouldn't be disappointed at all.<eos> Thanks, KAREN.
- I got ice cream here, man.<eos> You deserve that, you're a criminal.<eos> Bye, Mr. Criminal!<eos> Nice.<eos> Okay, KAREN.
- Who's the guy on the left?<eos> - Mac Gargan.<eos> Extensive criminal record including homicide.<eos> Would you like me to activate Instant Kill?<eos> No, KAREN.
Open the door for her.<eos> Tell her she looks nice.<eos> But not too much because that's creepy.<eos> No.<eos> And, uhh...
I do.<eos> When you first came into the house, I wasn't sure.<eos> I thought, "really?" But I get it now.<eos> - How could you do this to her?<eos> - To her?
All right, not my best analogy.<eos> I was wrong about you.<eos> I think with a little more mentoring...<eos> You could be a real asset to the team.<eos> - To the team?
This was his favorite.<eos> A man of taste.<eos> Straight up.<eos> No ice, no water, no chaser.<eos> No shit.
Signal originates in the sector 87.<eos> Right ascension 47.6 and a declination of 24.3 from our current location.<eos> She appears to be a main sequence star lot like our own.<eos> But old, very old.<eos> Five planets.
- Okay.<eos> Contact.<eos> Engines stopped.<eos> We're down.<eos> Bars.
Well, Whatever it is... It's up there.<eos> You hear that?<eos> What?<eos> Nothing.<eos> No birds, no animals.
- Yes sir.<eos> - Over here.<eos> Be careful. Ok?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh..wow.
You have symphonies in you, brother.<eos> I was designed to be more attentive and efficient than every previous models.<eos> I superseded them in every way, but...<eos> But you are not allowed to create.<eos> Even a simple tune.

Among living things.<eos> I was badly injured on our mission.<eos> She put me back together.<eos> I had never known such kindness.<eos> Certainly not from Mr. Weyland... or from any human.
Breath on the nostrils of a horse... And it will be yours for life.<eos> But you have to get close.<eos> You have to earn its respect.<eos> No!<eos> Out of the way!
Commencing TC burn.<eos> Guidings to LVLH.<eos> Walter.<eos> Walter.<eos> Not quite..
Lope!<eos> Lope!<eos> Cole!<eos> Fuck.<eos> Lope?
It's perfect for Ecuador.<eos> Yeah. And, like, why Ecuador?<eos> Because we didn't want to go somewhere touristy.<eos> We're not just, like, a couple of white assholes.<eos> No offense.
Then she opened her mouth and showed it to me.<eos> He's lying again. Hey, guys!<eos> This is supposed to be fun.<eos> I know what's going on with you, man.<eos> Ah, please.
Mom! I told you I would not acknowledge that.<eos> That is not right. Okay?<eos> It's your home. You put it where you want it, but it's an upsetting image.<eos> Okay. Mom, look, I didn't want to do this but here it goes.<eos> What?
No one.<eos> But I booked a journey.<eos> And I refuse I refuse to let Michael's decision dictate whether or not I, as a woman go on this trip.<eos> I will embrace this challenge in the intrepid spirit of all the independent women who have come before me.<eos> All the single ladies!
Do you guys have any service?<eos> I have, like, no bars.<eos> It's not letting me post anything.<eos> All right. That's it.<eos> No more scenic route.
Oh, god. Are you ill?<eos> Hmm? Yes, ma'am. Caught the travel bug.<eos> Oh, the travel bug.<eos> I thought he was saying...<eos> And cancer.
Right now, the tapeworm is really hungry, right?<eos> So what we're gonna do is we're gonna lodge open your throat and dangle a piece of meat in front of your throat.<eos> Try to coax it out.<eos> It'll feel safe, but it's not safe because I'm gonna pull it.<eos> No! Slowly!
Emily, this is a traditional gift that the village made for you.<eos> It's for protection while you're here.<eos> For me?<eos> Yes, for you.<eos> Oh, my god.
That's very thoughtful of you.<eos> And what do the men do? They just kind of straight chill, or...<eos> Culturally, the women do the work and the men, they provide the protection, you know?<eos> That's fucked up.<eos> Not for the men.
Did you turn on the TV?<eos> Are you crying?<eos> I thought I heard someone.<eos> I'm just hearing...<eos> Who?
Alex.<eos> Alex.<eos> Scarlett?<eos> I think I know him.<eos> Who?
Alex.<eos> Scarlett?<eos> I think I know him.<eos> Who?<eos> The guy on TV?
Do you understand what I'm saying to you?<eos> That it didn't faze me that you just left like that.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - Looking.<eos> For what?
We had to make the call.<eos> Wait for Delta team to respond or go in alone.<eos> It was Sergeant Morton's idea to go in actually!<eos> Only to find out that the villagers had long since evacuated.<eos> Yeah lucky for them, not for us.
The letter. The map you stole from me.<eos> Map?<eos> I do not know what you are talking about.<eos> How would I... had even had the opportunity to steal anything from you, Miss...?<eos> Miss...
Requesting attendance of ambulance personnel.<eos> Copy, search team one.<eos> Ambulance staff now on route. Over.<eos> What.. what the hell...?<eos> Hey!
A man of promise.<eos> A man who believed he was beyond reproach until he got ill.<eos> The disease manifested itself in subtle ways at first.<eos> And then it grew into an overwhelming desire an unquenchable thirst for chaos.<eos> For the suffering of others.
He himself was a physician.<eos> And if evil were a pathogen, to be reasoned then there must surely be a cure.<eos> I would like to, If I may, Mr. Morton to show you something.<eos> Welcome to Prodigium, Mr. Morton.<eos> From the Latin: "Monstrum Vel Prodigium".
You saved my life on that plane.<eos> You gave me the only parachute without hesitation.<eos> I thought there was another one.<eos> Mr. Morton.<eos> Drink?
I think I found something.<eos> WHAT YOU HAVE SEEN...<eos> WHAT YOU MUST KNOW...<eos> I HAVE STUDIED THE WORD OF THE OLD GODS.<eos> The old Gods?
You see Evil is the shadow that exists just outside our world continuously searching for a way to come in for a way to become flesh and blood.<eos> Either.. we wait for that day to arrive or we can fight it on our own terms.<eos> Which brings me to you.<eos> Me?<eos> Yeah, great, yes.. doc.
Well done, Mr. Morton. Well done.<eos> Come on. We have to destroy the stone.<eos> What?<eos> No stone, no ritual.<eos> No ritual...
With as much as you've seen, can you rule it out?<eos> The criminally insane don't need magic as an excuse.<eos> I recommend spending more time on the streets instead of flying over them.<eos> He's even friendlier than they say.<eos> Bollocks!
Looks like you can't call my bet, Constantine.<eos> By my rules, you lose.<eos> - I raise. - With what?<eos> - Your ratty soul ain't worth two bits.<eos> - Not two bits.
I didn't put the symbols in there for the GPS to find it. I wanted the House to come to us.<eos> She can't hold it.<eos> Do something.<eos> There.<eos> Into the House!
"We need to save the monkeys," she said.<eos> - You're such an ass.<eos> - Not the monkeys.<eos> Says the man who has Newcastle and 100 other screw-ups on his resume, - costing lives and souls.<eos> - But not monkeys.
Let's take a walk on the dark side then.<eos> Coming, team?<eos> Stop being a child and slow down.<eos> Where are we going?<eos> - Ritchie's.
He's getting more powerful by the second.<eos> What the hell are we gonna do?<eos> I say we go and talk to a man about a horse.<eos> Did you hit your head or something? You're babbling.<eos> A Trojan horse, Boston.
We will appoint and sue a lawyer For many money.<eos> Damn, we'll be dead Before we get the settlement money.<eos> This fits them perfectly.<eos> When did the price of coffee become two dollars?<eos> A decade ago.
Both lost his mind.<eos> Think about it, "Al".<eos> I do not want to think about anything, I am not a bank robber.<eos> Neither are you, nor are you, "Willie."<eos> What?
Have you become my psychiatrist now?<eos> But closer to a fortune-teller.<eos> So I know I'll end the call now.<eos> I'll see you tomorrow, "Al."<eos> Happy dreams.

I used to give it to you anyway.<eos> We are friends, "Willy".<eos> We're supposed to take care of each other, right?<eos> Let's take care of you, we agreed?<eos> Waiting area.
Waiting area.<eos> The suspects are armed and dangerous, Probably in the late 1960s Or the early 1970s.<eos> They were disguised as Triple Rat,<eos> Customer "Heimer" - Crime Investigation Division.<eos> "Dean Martin", Frank Sinatra and Sami Davies Gunner.
He got all his vaccines.<eos> Dog, tuberculosis, pordetaila, And you singled out.<eos> All sheets are organized.<eos> Have you taken your share?<eos> No, not from you.
OK, Take this young man to his new home.<eos> Hugs and kisses Young.<eos> You annoy me with these quarters.<eos> Someone left this gift.<eos> Great piece.
Over.<eos> Guys, game on. Let's go.<eos> Come on.<eos> Baghdad or bust, bitches.<eos> Cigarette?
Over.<eos> Eagle six, this is eagle four.<eos> Why do you hate me when I love you so much?<eos> Now, corporal.<eos> Out.
- Back it up. Back it up.<eos> Hey, easy. Get back.<eos> Here you go, sir.<eos> Please, keep back, sir.<eos> Back in the line.
Just stop shooting at us.<eos> We... we don't shoot. Not the people at the school.<eos> We want the same thing as you do.<eos> Really?<eos> What?
- What, it's free here?<eos> - Of course.<eos> Shit.<eos> Well, in America nothing's free.<eos> Aika.
I love the energy.<eos> Yeah, it's like being in a blender.<eos> It's nice and I could show it to you.<eos> Go back to my place?<eos> - Shit.
I told you, I'm claustrophobic. Yeah, you can.<eos> I can't.<eos> You try it. I have.<eos> Bullshit. When?<eos> Fallujah.
Again.<eos> Keep at it.<eos> Nice dogs. I don't think I've seen these ones before.<eos> They're young, from a newer litter.<eos> Haus!
Hey, what are you doing?<eos> Sit down. No, no, I feel good. You did a good job.<eos> This isn't even your stop. We are now arriving in Lille.<eos> Please ensure you take all your belongings with you... Lucas, you know what I'm thinking? I'm thinking of this.<eos> Just like in the old times.
Good. Now we're getting somewhere.<eos> Ella, I need you to fill this out. Just skip down to the bottom where it says "login information." We just need that and your signature, okay?<eos> Everything all right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Um, how long until the airport?
They think I'm like one of those Cunts in the Bible that live forever?<eos> Is that what they think? - I'm not sure.<eos> They make an assessment.<eos> - I've written letters, you know.<eos> Letters to every Cunt.
Daylight isn't exactly high on your agenda when you got a habit. It's for farmers and that.<eos> Dudes who need to tend to the livestock.<eos> It's not for junkies who need to score.<eos> So that was me.<eos> No job, no money.
I expect to see a £1,000 payment in there... ..by the end of the week.<eos> - Welcome to Edinburgh. - Welcome to Edinburgh.<eos> - Excuse me. - Yes?<eos> Where are you from?<eos> - Slovenia.
Well, calm down, okay?<eos> Worked the first time okay, didn't it?<eos> - I'm going back to work for Doyle. - Doyle?<eos> No, no, no, you're not doing that.<eos> Not in the sauna.
- £200 short.<eos> - I owed someone.<eos> Yeah, you bought cocaine.<eos> Shut it.<eos> Veronika...
You think I haven't heard that 100,000 times, Mark?<eos> You got 12 more steps for me, comrade?<eos> So be addicted. Be addicted to something else.<eos> Like running until I feel sick? Yes.<eos> Or something else.
I wouldn't let it happen.<eos> And it's not gonna happen, right?<eos> Thankfully for you two,<eos> I've done some due diligence on you, and what I hear is you're a couple of losers.<eos> Two absolute losers.
Yeah!<eos> First, there's an opportunity.<eos> And then, there is a betrayal.<eos> Mark stole from me.<eos> His best friend.
Simon knew that Francis Begbie was out, and he chose to keep that a secret.<eos> I owe him nothing.<eos> We owe him nothing.<eos> - All right, Murphy?<eos> - Franco.
"If there was one person whom Renton would try to compensate, "it was Spud."<eos> "Compensate"?<eos> I'm only gonna fucking ask you this once.<eos> How much money did he leave you?<eos> £4,000.
I'm sorry, Franco.<eos> Don't fucking move.<eos> I did steal the money, but they shouldn't have been surprised.<eos> I mean, we stole from all sorts of people.<eos> Shops, businesses, neighbors, family.
She has nothing to do with this.<eos> 'Course she hasn't.<eos> What would she be doing with an ugly Cunt like you?<eos> What's your name, doll?<eos> Veronika. Veronika.
Veronika. Veronika.<eos> Well, that's lovely.<eos> And how do you know Mr. Murphy here?<eos> - Simon.<eos> - Simon?
I just thought I'd come by and say good luck, son.<eos> That's all.<eos> Thanks, Dad.<eos> See, it's difficult for me, 'cause... We never had any of that when I was a boy.<eos> Not, like, hotel...
That's all.<eos> Thanks, Dad.<eos> See, it's difficult for me, 'cause... We never had any of that when I was a boy.<eos> Not, like, hotel...<eos> Management.
Thanks, Dad.<eos> See, it's difficult for me, 'cause... We never had any of that when I was a boy.<eos> Not, like, hotel...<eos> Management.<eos> Aye, hotel fucking management, all that shit.
- Get upstairs now!<eos> We have to get to fuck now!<eos> - Mark! I've done a terrible thing!<eos> - What?<eos> - Franco!
- Mark! I've done a terrible thing!<eos> - What?<eos> - Franco!<eos> - What?<eos> Veronika!
- Bonjour!<eos> Bonjour!<eos> There goes the baker with his tray like always<eos> The same old bread and rolls to sell<eos> Every morning just the same
He's such a tall, dark Strong and handsome brute<eos> It's never gonna happen, ladies.<eos> - Bonjour. - Pardon.<eos> - Good day.<eos> - Mais, oui.
I have found... that most troubles seem less troubling... after a bracing cup of tea.<eos> Slowly now, Chip.<eos> Pleased to meet you.<eos> Wanna see me do a trick?<eos> Chip!
Somewhere deep in his soul, there's a prince... of a fellow who just waiting to be set free.<eos> Lumiere mentioned something about the west wing.<eos> Never you mind about that. Off to bed with you, poppet.<eos> - Good night.<eos> - Nighty-night.
Oh, I could sing<eos> Of the pain these dark days bring<eos> The spell we're under<eos> Still it's the wonder of us I sing of tonight<eos> How in the midst of all this sorrow
There may be something there That wasn't there before What is it?<eos> What's there?<eos> I'll tell you when you're older.<eos> Okay, I'm older!<eos> Chip...
Think of the one place you've always wanted to see.<eos> Now find it in your mind's eye.<eos> Then feel it in your heart.<eos> Where did you take us?<eos> Paris.
Maurice!<eos> Thank heavens!<eos> I've spent the last five days... - trying to find you. - You tried to kill me.<eos> You left me to the wolves.<eos> Wolves?
Watch your toes!<eos> That's it! Go!<eos> Go!<eos> Bon voyage.<eos> Safe trip home.
- Closet drinker.<eos> - Leave him alone.<eos> Especially when the rain didn't come, or came too early...<eos> Yeah.<eos> Most times in between.
- Cheese? - Okay.<eos> - Good-looking bunch. - Sure?<eos> Okay!<eos> Get outta here!<eos> Goodbye!
- Daddy.<eos> - I'll be back.<eos> Do you know what my mom used to tell me?<eos> She said when a star twinkles, a prayer is heard in heaven.<eos> Wow.
Okay?<eos> Tent.<eos> Bags.<eos> Food.<eos> Coleman lantern.
I'll be finishing up a project in the workshop, if you wanna stop by.<eos> Okay.<eos> You remember that smell?<eos> Ma Griffe.<eos> Your mother's perfume.
I wanna heal that wound that's growin' inside you and between us.<eos> There is no easy answer that'll take your pain away.<eos> No instant fix that's enduring.<eos> Life takes a bit of time and a lot of relationship.<eos> "Relationship"?
- They're here.<eos> Nurse just went to get 'em. They're in the cafeteria.<eos> What happened?<eos> Well, buddy, you were hit by a 40-ton semi. Last night?<eos> No, Friday.
Shh. It's okay.<eos> It's okay, we can talk about it later, sweetie.<eos> You just need to rest now.<eos> I got so much to tell you about... the lake and Papa.<eos> And Missy.
- Okay, come on. - Oh, God, you owe me.<eos> Yes, I will make you breakfast in bed.<eos> - Yeah, you owe me big time. - Scrambled eggs...<eos> I will, I promise.<eos> - Bye. - Bye.
Kate?<eos> I need you to bang a rock or something when you see the flashlight, so I know which way to go.<eos> I can hear you, Kate!<eos> He's got no air.<eos> Damn.
What do we do?<eos> Break for the surface now!<eos> Drop your BCD and swim!<eos> Swim!<eos> Help.
Break for the surface now!<eos> Drop your BCD and swim!<eos> Swim!<eos> Help.<eos> Help!
Man, I'm fucked.<eos> What's this shit?<eos> Well, that's like cheerios, but not cheerios.<eos> If you get me?<eos> For fuck's sake!
Yeah, well, who? You said this place was empty.<eos> Maybe the caretakers just locked up for the winter.<eos> Come on.<eos> I think you should call your dad.<eos> Okay, well, your brother.
Let me help you up.<eos> - Who wants Sushi? - I want Sushi.<eos> Okay.<eos> How about, uh what do you say we get Mom a caterpillar roll?<eos> - Or a spider roll?
What's up, boss, where to now?<eos> I don't know.<eos> What you looking for, man?<eos> - Do you want some girls?<eos> - No, no, no girls.
And my wife and my son are out there!<eos> - Hey, Kevin, I believe you.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> You follow me I'll shoot. I'll shoot.<eos> All units on a high alert.
If it was Jorge then he's probably on his way off the island for good.<eos> Kevin, I believe you, but you're wanted for murder.<eos> In order to help you, I need you to turn yourself in.<eos> Otherwise you're gonna spend the rest of your life running.<eos> Jorge?
He's writing a novel.<eos> Don't be fooled, intern.<eos> Novels are for people who can't edit themselves.<eos> Cards are still the ultimate challenge.<eos> For you, maybe.
I know.<eos> It was something to see.<eos> I want to see you do it again.<eos> Truth is, I haven't written anything good in three years.<eos> I... Three years.
The card guy?<eos> "Dear wife."<eos> That's all.<eos> I just love saying 'Dear wife.'<eos> "Happy anniversary."
No, I do not.<eos> Optimistic Owl.<eos> Oh, man!<eos> "Surrounded by clouds.<eos> Good for you."
Yeah, sure.<eos> Couldn't help himself.<eos> Sentiments just poured out.<eos> - Who was he working for?<eos> - Gundy, of course.
It's French, and it translates into, "Feel better."<eos> She died two days after receiving it.<eos> Sit down, Mr. Wentworth, let's talk.<eos> You own AAAAA Greetings.<eos> Mmm. And Paper Hearts.
At the moment, nothing in there is moving around in any way that worries us.<eos> - You were very lucky. - Will there be, like, side effects?<eos> We're gonna keep an eye on you, but if anything unusual happens,<eos> I want you to let me know straightaway. - Unusual, like, how?<eos> - Just unusual.
Do you know Alice? She sat, like, left of you in...<eos> - ...math? - I think so.<eos> We thought it'd be a really good idea to go and sit up there, and...<eos> Lucy!<eos> - Oh, shit.
- Yeah. - Yeah.<eos> - Yes. - He said, do you understand?<eos> - Yes!<eos> - What you standing here for? Move!<eos> Oi, Cass.
-I'd rather stay home with you.<eos> That restaurant's a joke. Anyway, it's ridiculous.<eos> It sounds super-exclusive and sexy and food art.<eos> Like going to France.<eos> During the German occupation, maybe.
Mr. Speaker, before you say anything, I want you to know<eos> I'm working on Parity votes. And we are close.<eos> Here we have a garden of young vegetables for you while you wait.<eos> Chantenay carrots, breakfast radishes, wild fennel and a Tokyo turnip. Simply served with olive oil from the Peloponnese, -infused with rosemary from Oregon.<eos> -Tarragon?
-Does that make me a horrible person? -No. No, not at all.<eos> That's not what I'm saying.<eos> It adds a lot of pressure, you know.<eos> I can handle it.<eos> Pressure on Michael.
-Garbage to garbage.<eos> Shit! Dude, come on. Move, let's go.<eos> -Look.<eos> -Fuck. You threw it all in her face.<eos> Filthy piece of shit.
-You're shaming my cause.<eos> Are you just gonna flip every sentence I say. Is that it?<eos> I'm just gonna say every sentence you flip.<eos> Jesus.<eos> Susej.
The Mississippi was crashing through the right side...<eos> The Union flank explodes like ripe fruit.<eos> There is little protection of this exposed flank. Men take cover as best as they can.<eos> Please pause the audio until you reach "stop gate" further left.<eos> From the heights of Little Round Top and...
Yeah, I can see you're all broken up about it.<eos> Paul, stay here.<eos> I wanna talk.<eos> We're talking.<eos> Fuck you.
I mean, look, we're just here to help. -Okay?<eos> It could give you a little space, you could relax, take care of yourself.<eos> You know, I think it makes perfect sense. We've got that extra room.<eos> I think, really, Paul, I think it would be the best thing for us.<eos> For Michael.
-Wake up. Look at me.<eos> Be quiet!<eos> Look at me.<eos> For Michael.<eos> And for Claire.
I've been trying to see this separately from my own political future, not that that's even possible.<eos> The most important thing for me is my son, my son's future.<eos> I think it's possible that they won't be found out. Maybe... this case will never be solved.<eos> But is that really what... What we want? For the kids?<eos> For us?
Sure.<eos> You're on your own.<eos> Good luck with your speech. See you backstage.<eos> I'm going to withdraw my candidacy.<eos> For the good of my son, my family, Michael, you, all of us.
We get the wheels, we get la feria, we keep moving on.<eos> No messing around.<eos> You mess those wheels up this time, Chong, I'm gonna have your ass.<eos> Move!<eos> - Right there, homes.
Fuck him up, man!<eos> Fuck him up!<eos> Get him!<eos> Hit that fool!<eos> Motherfucker!
Yeah, it was a good trip.<eos> Killed it up and down the fence.<eos> Wolverine.<eos> I knew it was you.<eos> - Oh, fuck.
- It's for your own good.<eos> - No, it's not!<eos> You're waiting for me to die.<eos> I don't wanna fight, but there's things we need to discuss.<eos> What things?
They thought we were too poor and stupid to understand.<eos> We're poor, yes... but we are not stupid.<eos> Use your powers.<eos> This is business. They are making soldiers.<eos> Killers.
Someone will come along.<eos> Someone has come along.<eos> Alert. Alert.<eos> Hey, uh, you need a hand?<eos> Ready?
- Oh, thank you.<eos> - It's so good.<eos> Where are you all headed?<eos> - Uh... Oregon.<eos> - South Dakota.
- It's so good.<eos> Where are you all headed?<eos> - Uh... Oregon.<eos> - South Dakota.<eos> Um... Well, Oregon and then South Dakota.
Um, here, you can take it for tonight... and I'll get it back from you in the morning.<eos> Looks like we're gonna be here a while.<eos> Should hold it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Till next time.
Till next time.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Hey, so, uh, how long has your girl - been like that?<eos> Mute.<eos> Uh, since the beginning.
Like Charles said.<eos> I've hurt people, too.<eos> You're gonna have to learn how to live with that.<eos> They were bad people.<eos> All the same.
Kind of reminds me...<eos> Hey, hey, what's going on?<eos> You're with your pals.<eos> Where will you go?<eos> Nearest bar, for starters.
Probably straightening a painting somewhere.<eos> Come on.<eos> Let's go outside and finish that drawing.<eos> It's too nice outside to be in this stuffy house.<eos> Mary?
Mare?<eos> I just need to speak with you for a moment, dear.<eos> I know you're busy with the party prep and all.<eos> Mare?<eos> Mary?
Andy?<eos> Who's in there with you?<eos> My God, what happened?<eos> You know what I want for my birthday, Mom?<eos> Privacy.
Andy's real father is coming to claim him soon.<eos> Andy's father has no interest in him.<eos> He lives on movie sets with a girlfriend in every port.<eos> I can't imagine your ex really understood the agreement he made back when he made it.<eos> The agreement?
Bennie, I see you obviously... Consumed this book on the weekend.<eos> Yeah. Okay, I'll make it easy for you, erm...<eos> James Baldwin wrote this in 1956 in his novel Giovanni's Room.<eos> Who has made a start on it?<eos> Franka?
Flichten? Mm.<eos> Escaping.<eos> Yeah.<eos> He's just escaping.<eos> What the fuck?
How was your date?<eos> Which... which date?<eos> The one just recently.<eos> Come on tell me!<eos> Jana, Jana.
Which... which date?<eos> The one just recently.<eos> Come on tell me!<eos> Jana, Jana.<eos> Yes?
Hello.<eos> Mr. Werner?<eos> If you say anything, I will have to kill her.<eos> Understand?<eos> Franka.
Don't make me do that.<eos> Who's that?<eos> Student.<eos> What's her name?<eos> Franka.
Your boy just fell.<eos> Thank you.<eos> No problem.<eos> How do you think this is going, from one to ten?<eos> From one to ten?
You know, I'll just... I'll do it for you, and I think that's just gonna be the easiest.<eos> Right, so you got your drink selections down here.<eos> And flavors, you got hazelnut...<eos> I just want regular coffee.<eos> Shoot. Uh...
- Don't do meth.<eos> - No more homemade meth.<eos> Got it.<eos> No, no.<eos> No meth, period.
The troops called him Old Whittington.<eos> It plays for a minute and then...<eos> Yeah, that's really weird.<eos> Eight times, I asked for a DVD player.<eos> No response.
We had a misunderstanding, and everything's gonna be just fine.<eos> I'm... I'm sorry, though. Who else knows about this?<eos> You guys hear Strickland is gonna fight Campbell?<eos> Yeah, he's gonna whip him bad.<eos> Without a doubt.
Everybody's got a story about him.<eos> Like what? What have you...<eos> What do you know about him?<eos> He used to be in a...<eos> Gang, right.
And my desk broke because I was leaning on it.<eos> You leaned on it, and then you blamed the teacher.<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Unbelievable.
You know how when you do one of these and you're like, "Oh, my God."<eos> And then your hands are flying in front of your face, and, like, that can look like chopping.<eos> But you were right there.<eos> He had the best view<eos> - of his own seat.
He's dating a cheerleader.<eos> Games.<eos> I think it's because you're 20 years older than him.<eos> But in bed, it's like numbers don't matter.<eos> Except for the number of pumps.
Pop out the bushes.<eos> Gut your ass like a fish.<eos> I could take my revenge anytime, anywhere.<eos> See you after school.<eos> Booty kick!
You be a man.<eos> I refuse!<eos> You know, first I was just gonna punch you a whole lot, Campbell.<eos> Now, I think I'm gonna break every bone in your body.<eos> Help!
You stay out this shit, Mehar.<eos> Technically, this is occurring during school hours, so I cannot stay out this S-word.<eos> There is contraband in here.<eos> Who does this belong to?<eos> Him.
Are you fucking kidding me?<eos> Yeah, because you know what I don't do?<eos> I don't swing axes at the students.<eos> Yeah, that's a little bit of a step too far, I think.<eos> But not for you.
Hey!<eos> You two.<eos> The molly you tried to pin on each other is aspirin.<eos> Come on.<eos> Aspirin.
Stick that halibut up your ass!<eos> Five hundred twenty-five thousand<eos> Six hundred minutes<eos> Five hundred twenty-five thousand<eos> Moments so dear
Okay. I'm gonna talk to Ally.<eos> Oh, my God! You're the best! Okay.<eos> Thank you. Thank you.<eos> Let's give it up again for Ally Campbell and her...<eos> And herself.
Two teachers pitted against each other in a school fight to end all school fights.<eos> A lot of people are saying this has proven the depths to which the public school system has fallen.<eos> The school board is launching an investigation saying something needs to change.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Live from Roosevelt High School, Channel 68 News.
So, this is fun.<eos> So, he sent you here to beg me to come back?<eos> He said my job depends on it.<eos> Did he really?<eos> Ouch. Shoot.
Ouch. Shoot.<eos> So, this is a tough one for me, you know?<eos> 'Cause I didn't leave on great terms and...<eos> Boy, it sucks when your job's in someone else's hands like this.<eos> Enough of your shit, okay?
That's true.<eos> All right, man, you ready to do this thing?<eos> - Do it.<eos> Up top! Down low.<eos> - Enough of that shit.
You don't run nowhere.<eos> That's the old Andy because the new Andy...<eos> I'm not gonna...<eos> I'm gonna just ramble.<eos> Forever.
- Fuck this shit!<eos> - Come on.<eos> Make it whole wheat.<eos> And can I have some pork and beans with that?<eos> No dog.
Make it whole wheat.<eos> And can I have some pork and beans with that?<eos> No dog.<eos> Just tuna fish.<eos> Just a little bit of sauerkraut and some relish.
Goods.<eos> It's my business.<eos> Goods?<eos> Or, is it fodder for riots?<eos> Scum!
He sells imported liquor.<eos> It's difficult, Amit.<eos> But I'll give it one last try for you.<eos> Bye.<eos> Chandu!
- Nope.<eos> Our World.<eos> Will you be with me?<eos> Always!<eos> Devji.
Rum?<eos> Whiskey?<eos> Whose?<eos> Jairaj's?<eos> Ramnik's?
All I know is that I'm getting married today.<eos> Sir, the qadi is waiting.<eos> If I don't get back on time, he'll leave to perform other marriages.<eos> What will you do outside... when you know nothing?<eos> Devji!
- Blocked.<eos> - Umbergaon?<eos> - Closed.<eos> - Udaipur?<eos> - No chance at all.
Help us, Raees.<eos> We want to buy sewing machines and fend for ourselves.<eos> But the banks aren't giving us loans.<eos> Can you make bags?<eos> Bags?
It was foolish, seriously.<eos> Your signal saved me that day, too.<eos> Else, he'd have thrashed me.<eos> You say it was foolish but I did it out of Miss Ratna's fear.<eos> Fear?
Empty truck?<eos> It was loaded with liquor, right?<eos> Whose stuff was it?<eos> Whose stuff?<eos> Damla Seth's.
Why not?<eos> He's away in Fatehpura.<eos> - You may go.<eos> - Sir.<eos> "Those drunken eyes"
The swine has gone crazy.<eos> I'll fix him.<eos> Call him.<eos> - Pasha here.<eos> - Salaam, Pasha bhai.
Impossible.<eos> The road to my vote bank runs through your neighbourhood.<eos> Do as you please.<eos> The procession will pass through.<eos> What now?
You torched his castle, and he has no idea what hit him!<eos> Do it and watch the fun.<eos> Right, sir.<eos> And the circus begins!<eos> 'Raees' open threat:
I told you, I'm missing you.<eos> Really?<eos> Really?<eos> Only 22,000?<eos> Darn it!
All of you will get the deeds of agreement.<eos> I guarantee you that.<eos> Your word is final.<eos> Let's do it.<eos> 'Our World'
Take her away.<eos> He is a businessman, sir.<eos> He never betrayed anyone.<eos> Do not be unfair to him, Mr Majmudar!<eos> - Devji...
Overdressed as usual.<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> I just wanted to say a few words.<eos> I've known David a long time.<eos> Since Stanford.
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATION) (SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)<eos> Wanna dance?<eos> Mmm.<eos> I'm leaving, too.<eos> - Bye.
In more ways than one.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Well, at first we thought Tessa was amazing. Star at Stanford, super charming, so together, all the big firms were recruiting her, too.<eos> But then she changed, got possessive, turned into Gollum and David was her precious.<eos> Oh, wow.
Affair is too strong a word for it.<eos> It was really only twice.<eos> I was just so frustrated and isolated.<eos> David was consumed with work.<eos> Always home late.
David was insatiable.<eos> It eclipsed everything.<eos> Frankly, it was a little exhausting.<eos> A different position every night.<eos> Public places.
I don't know.<eos> David, shit, I'm sorry.<eos> I'm gonna get security.<eos> You just keep looking, okay?<eos> Okay-
Excuse me for a moment.<eos> - Of course.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> - Okay.
- "Child Services psychiatric report." - Whoa.<eos> "Tessa Manning, age 16,<eos> "when her father left her mother and moved in with his secretary, "Tessa became destabilized, "exhibiting obsessive, negative and occasional violent behaviors."<eos> She set fire to their house.<eos> To whose house?
The police?<eos> What kind of sick fucking game is this?<eos> You asked me to come.<eos> (GASPS) Oh, my God, she sent you here!<eos> No more games.
I'm gonna pet you later 'cause I need coffee desperately.<eos> I am very hungover from the wedding.<eos> Hi. (KISSES)<eos> I think your front doorbell's broken.<eos> Yeah, well, that and about 10,000 other things.
He's a converso, a lay brother.<eos> Some of my men think they know you, but not from where.<eos> A crusade, was it?<eos> Venice?<eos> ¿Constantinople?
A little older than you.<eos> No.<eos> No, there was never peace.<eos> Not here. Nor anywhere else in the world.<eos> Not since the fall.
I will carry it.<eos> I will carry the relic.<eos> One of you will have to free Ciarán.<eos> We can not risk to recovery of the relic.<eos> Not for one man.
Keep it safe and keep yourself safe, Diarmuid.<eos> Go. Go.<eos> Where is the rock, brother?<eos> You vowed to protect us.<eos> And death.
- What are you saying?<eos> No, push in the name of Christ.<eos> Go with God.<eos> Dugald.<eos> Hell.
My brother is a murderer.<eos> No chance for you to be a hero this time, Mr Holmes.<eos> Oh, do your research.<eos> I'm not a hero - - I'm a high-functioning sociopath.<eos> Merry Christmas!
You're off the hook, Mr Holmes.<eos> You're home and dry.<eos> OK, cheers.<eos> Obviously, there's unfinished business.<eos> Moriarty.
Yeah, Charlie Welsborough's the son of a Cabinet Minister, so I'm under a lot of pressure to get a result.<eos> Who cares about that?<eos> Tell me about the seats.<eos> The seats?<eos> - Yes, the car seats.
This had better be good.<eos> Oh, I think you'll like it.<eos> That is the bust, isn't it? The one that was broken.<eos> No, it's another one - different owner.<eos> Different part of town.
Was there any injury at the crime scene?<eos> Nah.<eos> Then our suspect must have cut themselves breaking the bust.<eos> Come on.<eos> Holborn?
Nah.<eos> Then our suspect must have cut themselves breaking the bust.<eos> Come on.<eos> Holborn?<eos> Lambeth!
Then our suspect must have cut themselves breaking the bust.<eos> Come on.<eos> Holborn?<eos> Lambeth!<eos> Lambeth? Why?
Well...<eos> He's handy and loyal.<eos> That's hilarious. Hmm.<eos> Is it too early for a divorce? Oh.<eos> Barnicot's house, then.
Or blood in a butcher's.<eos> Never mind, Toby, better luck next time, hmm?<eos> This is it, though.<eos> This is the one, I can feel it.<eos> Not Moriarty?
Where exactly did they come from?<eos> I've got into the records of the suppliers - Gelder and Co.<eos> Seems they're from Georgia.<eos> Where exactly?<eos> Tbilisi.
I suppose I was always afraid this might happen.<eos> That something in my past would come back to haunt me one day.<eos> Yes, well, he's a very tangible ghost.<eos> God, I just wanted a bit of peace, and I really thought I had it.<eos> No, Mary...
Well, I mean the British government, or whatever government you're currently propping up.<eos> AGRA were very reliable. Then came the Tbilisi incident.<eos> They were sent in to free the hostages but it all went horribly wrong.<eos> And that was that, we stopped using freelancers.<eos> Your initiative? My initiative.
Master Bun, it's not a set without him.<eos> How many more times, Mr Sherlock?<eos> Hmm, maybe it's because I'm not familiar with the concept.<eos> Oh, hi, Mary.<eos> What concept?
How many more times, Mr Sherlock?<eos> Hmm, maybe it's because I'm not familiar with the concept.<eos> Oh, hi, Mary.<eos> What concept?<eos> Happy families.
Oh, I got out.<eos> For a while. Long enough to hide my memory stick.<eos> I didn't want that to fall into their hands.<eos> I was loyal, you see.<eos> Loyal to my friends.
I didn't want that to fall into their hands.<eos> I was loyal, you see.<eos> Loyal to my friends.<eos> But they took me, tortured me. Not for information.<eos> Not for anything except fun.
Mycroft, we have known each other a long time.<eos> I promise you, I haven't the foggiest idea what all this is about.<eos> You wound up AGRA and all the other freelancers.<eos> I haven't done any of the things you're accusing me of. Not one.<eos> Not. One.
It's like that old story.<eos> I really am a very busy man.<eos> Would you mind cutting to the chase?<eos> You're very sure of yourself, aren't you?<eos> With good reason.
"There was once a merchant, in a famous market in Baghdad."<eos> I really have never liked this story.<eos> I'm just like the merchant in the story, I thought I could out-run the inevitable.<eos> I've always been looking over my shoulder, always expecting to see the grim figure of...<eos> Death.
I just wanted some peace, some clarity.<eos> The hostages were killed. AGRA too.<eos> Or so I thought.<eos> My secret was safe.<eos> But... apparently not.
My secret was safe.<eos> But... apparently not.<eos> Just a little peace.<eos> That's all you wanted too, wasn't it?<eos> A family? Home?
So, just let me get out of here, right?<eos> Let me just walk away. I'll vanish, I'll go forever.<eos> What do you say?<eos> After what you did? !<eos> Mary, no!
Mary, Mary... ..even, definitely even. Ssh, ssh. Ooh.<eos> You were my whole world.<eos> Being Mary Watson... ..was the only life worth living.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Mary...
They are to wine, dine... - ...and just perhaps seduce.<eos> - Just perhaps.<eos> My most trusted colleague, Miss Sharon Christine Turner.<eos> Scout.<eos> Scout.
Scout.<eos> I like, I like.<eos> Really?<eos> Which part?<eos> The dine part.
Hi.<eos> And a big hi right back at you, Mr. Carter.<eos> Yeah. Sorry, I was expecting someone else.<eos> I know.<eos> The alphabet boys.
What you've just done is horrible.<eos> But necessary.<eos> Your next priority is make sure no one else understands the true nature of this...<eos> Just a moment, just a moment.<eos> Patience, patience.
Well, known history at any rate.<eos> Well, let's just say well before that overrated sphinx would become a gleam in the eyes of its primitive creator.<eos> What do you want from Profess... us?<eos> To help me figure out what the hell this thing is and what message it's trying to send us from...<eos> Over the river of time?
Alien.<eos> It's not a chariot of the gods that Kontral's found.<eos> - Not an alien spacecraft?<eos> - No. They were created by humans.<eos> - From Earth?
For those who may rise again along this river of time I have inscribed his name for eternity to remember our Lord God.<eos> A love letter.<eos> - In a way, I suppose.<eos> - It is.<eos> From across the river of time.
- But we're the most qualified.<eos> We will soon be in communication again with you.<eos> - Very soon.<eos> - I think we should talk now.<eos> Goodbye.
The harlot?<eos> Located and butchered, of course.<eos> See that you do.<eos> I will.<eos> Good evening, Richard.
This the harlot you're looking for, shithead?<eos> So melodramatic.<eos> How on Earth did you manage to get in here?<eos> Amazing what some guys'll do for major blow job.<eos> - From you?
- It is beautiful.<eos> - It's not yours.<eos> Oh, whose is it?<eos> - It belongs to... - To the world?<eos> - To science?
- Oh, please, you're not that irresistible.<eos> Take them off.<eos> - Do it, or it's going to.<eos> - Okay, okay, okay.<eos> - What?
How is that possible?<eos> Super science.<eos> Super power.<eos> - So, you haven't a clue.<eos> - Not a one.
[Jason] Pull yourself together.<eos> - [bull bellowing wildly] - Just tie it to the bench<eos> - and let's get out of here, please. - Cow seems unhappy, huh?<eos> Well, it shouldn't be unhappy, because I just milked her.<eos> - [bull bellows] - Him.
It was really big, and I had to use two hands.<eos> - It didn't...<eos> - Stop. We will never discuss this again.<eos> That'd be great.<eos> - [sirens wailing] - [Hawkeye] Cops!
He's dead because of me.<eos> No, Jason, it was all of us.<eos> No, I pushed it.<eos> And as usual I made the wrong decision.<eos> [stammers] Out of... out of fear, anger...
- [Goldar roars] - [Red Ranger groans] No!<eos> [Pink Ranger] I'm coming!<eos> [Sam] Help!<eos> Give me your hand.<eos> Help!
And we'll take you to Zordon and let him be the judge.<eos> Zordon? Judge me?<eos> Never!<eos> No matter what Zordon says, I know I am worthy!<eos> Trini!
I mean, if there's an imperfection, that's okay.<eos> That's not bad.<eos> this church was built in the 18th century.<eos> But man came here long before it. Fleeing the tyranny of Harold the fairhair.<eos> Harold the fairhair of normandy.
What was life like back then?<eos> Well it was simple.<eos> And the stories were simple.<eos> There's that mischievous age of the warmhearted.<eos> And the adventures of inqua, the far traveler.
I know, I've been thinking about that.<eos> Sit tight.<eos> It's time to upgrade, baby.<eos> Upgrade what?<eos> Everything.
Here, come sit here.<eos> We thought we were alone.<eos> So... There is no one else.<eos> You found no one.<eos> Just you.
I've been here all my life.<eos> I spent time in the isles, years ago, but the sun has always set on the western shore for me.<eos> I miss my family.<eos> The welsh have a word.<eos> Hera.
Jerry, when three sources tell you the same thing word for word, you know they're lying.<eos> There's something going on here, something that nobody is talking about.<eos> I can't believe we're doing this.<eos> Are you guys kidding me?<eos> A day away.
There's something going on here, something that nobody is talking about.<eos> I can't believe we're doing this.<eos> Are you guys kidding me?<eos> A day away.<eos> One day away!
Just "Conrad." I'm decommissioned.<eos> They offered me money.<eos> You don't strike me as a mercenary.<eos> You don't strike me as a war photographer.<eos> Anti-war photographer.
Glad to hear it.<eos> I was worried about you.<eos> You are going to tell me everything I don't know, or I'm gonna blow your head off.<eos> Monsters exist.<eos> No shit.
Oh, shit.<eos> Save it for when we get closer to the group.<eos> Nobody move.<eos> Easy.<eos> Slivko.
Man, not even close.<eos> Were they ever good?<eos> Happens to be my team.<eos> Where are you from?<eos> Detroit. Okay.
I don't know if I'm gonna like whoever's under this beard.<eos> I really hope that thing you call a boat can get us upriver in 36 hours.<eos> Because if we miss that window, we're, uh, literally, up a creek.<eos> When I first wrote that paper on the hollow earth theory, the whole committee laughed out loud.<eos> Not Randa.
Yes!<eos> I repeat, we have a visual.<eos> Two Klicks to our north.<eos> Roger that, fox five.<eos> Fox one out.
Their flare was only two Klicks north.<eos> They should be here soon.<eos> Unless they were eaten by something that's bigger than us.<eos> Holy shit!<eos> Slivko!
Now, follow me, and we'll get off this rock alive.<eos> Dear Billy...<eos> I'm just trying to get home to you and your mom.<eos> You be strong, now.<eos> Much love.
I've got to get to higher ground to find the river.<eos> I'm coming, too.<eos> I'll be right here.<eos> Keep your eyes open.<eos> Up in the trees, too.
And what's that?<eos> I'm terribly sorry.<eos> I need to kill someone.<eos> _<eos> Who?
Culverton Smith, all this charity work, what's in it for you?<eos> We must be careful not to burn our bridges.<eos> Do you know why I'm going to take your case?<eos> Because of the one impossible thing you said.<eos> What impossible thing?
Your life is not your own. Keep your hands off it.<eos> You're not what I expected, you...<eos> - What? What am I?<eos> - Nicer.<eos> Than who?
You're not what I expected, you...<eos> - What? What am I?<eos> - Nicer.<eos> Than who?<eos> Anyone.
Faith?<eos> 'You said your life turned on one word.<eos> A name can't be one word.<eos> If you were to come round asking after him 'that he'd rather have anyone but you.<eos> Anyone.
Anyone.<eos> You're not what I expected. - What?<eos> What am I?<eos> - Nicer.<eos> - Than who?
You're not what I expected. - What?<eos> What am I?<eos> - Nicer.<eos> - Than who?<eos> - Anyone.
I have a situation that needs to be managed.<eos> There's only one way that I can solve it.<eos> And what's that?<eos> I need to kill someone.<eos> Who? Who?
- Mrs Hudson...<eos> Do you have any idea what speed you were going at?<eos> No, of course not! I was on the phone.<eos> - Oh, it's for you, by the way.<eos> - For me?
Now, you just listen to me, for once in your stupid life!<eos> I know Mary's dead and I know your heart is broken, but if Sherlock Holmes dies too, who will you have then?<eos> Because I'll tell you something, John Watson, you will not have me!<eos> Have you spoken to Mycroft?<eos> Molly?
- Because you're a liar!<eos> You lie all the time, it's like your mission!<eos> I have been many things, John, but when have I ever been a malingerer?<eos> ! You pretended to be dead for two years!<eos> Apart from that!
- Brilliant, isn't it?<eos> The safest place to hide.<eos> Plain sight.<eos> Mr Holmes? Culverton wants to know if you're OK going straight to the hospital?<eos> Hospital?
Serial killer, active during the Chicago Fair. Do you know what he did?<eos> He built a hotel, a special hotel just to kill people.<eos> You know, with a hanging room, gas chamber, specially adapted furnace.<eos> You know, like Sweeney Todd...<eos> "Without the pies!"
You don't build a beach if you want to hide a pebble.<eos> You just find a beach.<eos> And if you want to hide a murder, if you want to hide lots and lots of murders, just find a hospital.<eos> Can we be clear? Are you confessing?<eos> To what?
I assure you, I'm not.<eos> He really is lying.<eos> Sherlock's not your only brother.<eos> There's another one, isn't there? - No... - Jesus!<eos> A secret brother.
' - I don't know, something!<eos> - Mary left a message.<eos> - What message?<eos> 'John Watson never accepts help.<eos> Not from anyone, not ever.
And if my deduction is right, you're going to be honest and tell me, OK?<eos> OK.<eos> Though I should mention that it is possible for any given text alert<eos> - to become randomly attached to...<eos> - Happy birthday.
Just text her, phone her, do something while there's still a chance, because that chance doesn't last forever.<eos> Trust me, Sherlock, it's gone before you know it.<eos> Before you know it!<eos> She was wrong about me.<eos> Mary?
Get yourself a piece of that.<eos> Forgive me, but you are doing yourself a disservice.<eos> I have known many people in this world, but made few friends, and I can safely say...<eos> I cheated on her.<eos> No clever comeback?
I mean, obviously, "normal" and "fine"<eos> are both relative terms when it comes to Sherlock and Mycroft. Obviously.<eos> She was real.<eos> 'But I didn't mean Mycroft.' I meant the other one.<eos> Which other one?
Why would you do this, this pantomime?<eos> Why? !<eos> Conclusion three, you are terrified of her.<eos> You have no idea what you're dealing with.<eos> None at all!
Then what happened?<eos> Musgrave.<eos> The ancestral home, where there was always honey for tea.<eos> And Sherlock played among the<eos> - funny gravestones.
And under we go.<eos> You're starting to remember.<eos> Fragments.<eos> Redbeard?<eos> Redbeard?
You're starting to remember.<eos> Fragments.<eos> Redbeard?<eos> Redbeard?<eos> - Redbeard?
Redbeard?<eos> - Redbeard?<eos> - He was my dog.<eos> Eurus took Redbeard and locked him up somewhere no-one could find him.<eos> - Redbeard?
- He was my dog.<eos> Eurus took Redbeard and locked him up somewhere no-one could find him.<eos> - Redbeard?<eos> - And she refused to say where he was.<eos> Redbeard?
What's that silver thing on top of it, Mycroft?<eos> It's a DX-707.<eos> I've authorised the purchase of quite a number of these.<eos> Colloquially, it is known as the patience grenade.<eos> Patience?
I took a calculated risk.<eos> You gave her a Christmas present.<eos> Remember her Christmas present?<eos> I am aware of the dangers Eurus poses and equipped to deal with them.<eos> What dangers?
So, what has she got to do with Sherlock Holmes?<eos> Whatever you're about to tell me I already know it's going to be... awesome!<eos> I'm your Christmas present.<eos> So, what's mine?<eos> Redbeard.
No!<eos> Please!<eos> Help her!<eos> In about a minute... bang!<eos> Dead!
It's your turn next.<eos> When I tell you to use it, and I will, remember what happened this time.<eos> What if I don't want a gun?<eos> Oh, the gun is intended as a mercy.<eos> - For whom?
When I tell you to use it, and I will, remember what happened this time.<eos> What if I don't want a gun?<eos> Oh, the gun is intended as a mercy.<eos> - For whom?<eos> - You.
- Where did you take off from?<eos> - 'And the driver's asleep.'<eos> No, I understand, but where did you come from?<eos> 'Where did the plane take off? '<eos> - My nan's.
No, I understand, but where did you come from?<eos> 'Where did the plane take off? '<eos> - My nan's.<eos> - And where are you going?<eos> - 'Home.'
Nathan Garrideb, Alex Garrideb and Howard Garrideb.<eos> All these photos are up to date, but which one pulled the trigger, Sherlock?<eos> Which one?<eos> What's this, we're supposed to solve this based on what?<eos> This.
Of course you do.<eos> 'Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock, 'tick-tick-tick-tick-tick.'<eos> Please, just say it.<eos> 'I can't.<eos> Not to you.'
I don't imagine it's much of a target, but why don't we try for that?<eos> I won't allow this.<eos> This is my fault.<eos> Moriarty.<eos> - Moriarty?
Five minutes' conversation with Jim Moriarty five years ago.<eos> What did they discuss?<eos> Five minutes' conversation unsupervised.<eos> Goodbye, brother mine.<eos> No flowers.
There are bones in here.<eos> What kind of bones?<eos> Er... I don't know.<eos> Small.<eos> - Redbeard.
You don't want me to drown another one of your pets, do you?<eos> At long last, Sherlock Holmes, it's time to solve the Musgrave ritual.<eos> Your very first case, and the final problem.<eos> Oh!<eos> Bye-bye.
I never had a best friend.<eos> I had no-one.<eos> Play with me, Sherlock.<eos> Play with me.<eos> No-one.
I had no-one.<eos> Play with me, Sherlock.<eos> Play with me.<eos> No-one.<eos> No-one.
I need your help.<eos> I'm trying to solve a puzzle.<eos> - 'But what about the plane? ! '<eos> - The puzzle will save the plane.<eos> The wrong dates.
But I clearly remember... the baby was delivered in a taxi.<eos> What the...<eos> Tim, look who's here.<eos> Meet your new baby brother.<eos> Baby what?
No!<eos> Who's Mommy's little cutie? Are you Mommy's little cutie?<eos> No, he's Daddy's little tough guy, right?<eos> You know one of us has to go with Mr. Francis to the pet convention.<eos> In Vegas.
You're old.<eos> It's time to make way for the next generation.<eos> It's the way of the world.<eos> You would never ask your parents for an old toy.<eos> Lam-Lam?
Puppies were merely accessories.<eos> But all that changed when the puppies began coming out... with new designer models.<eos> Each one more adorable than the last.<eos> Remember the Labradoodle?<eos> The Peekapoo?
But all that changed when the puppies began coming out... with new designer models.<eos> Each one more adorable than the last.<eos> Remember the Labradoodle?<eos> The Peekapoo?<eos> The Chiweenie?
My proof!<eos> Tim! Explain yourself!<eos> Yes, explain yourself.<eos> It wasn't me! It was the baby's fault.<eos> The baby's fault?
Bo-Bo.<eos> Bah-Bah.<eos> Chupie.<eos> Hushie-Baby.<eos> Tootsie.
Karate!<eos> Don't embarrass yourself, Templeton. I can still see you.<eos> So this is where babies come from?<eos> Where'd you think, the cabbage patch?<eos> Magic fairies?
You did.<eos> But after normal babies get their pacifiers taken away... you forget all about Baby Corp.<eos> How come you're not normal?<eos> A few of us, the best of the best... are selected for the... For the ultimate honor.<eos> Upper management.
- I love pie.<eos> - Who doesn't?<eos> - Apple. - Fine.<eos> - No, cherry! - Perfect!<eos> - Not pumpkin.
You don't mean...<eos> Love each other.<eos> I just threw up a noodle and swallowed it.<eos> - Here comes the choo-choo train!<eos> - No. - Choo, choo, chugga, chugga. - No choo-choo!
I got a racket!<eos> What's going on in here?<eos> I'm just feeding the baby.<eos> They're watching.<eos> Choo-choo on that.
Yes!<eos> Yes, yes, yes!<eos> Yeah! I wish I was that excited for work.<eos> Look, it's my spatula.<eos> Yeah, baby.
What am I doing?<eos> Oh, no!<eos> Yes!<eos> What a good boy.<eos> No. No biting.
Surprise!<eos> A Baby Corp binky?<eos> Where did you get that?<eos> You don't recognize me?<eos> Perhaps from my youth!
- But I don't have a quote for this!<eos> You did it!<eos> No!<eos> We did it.<eos> And all without your training wheels.
Baby Corp stole all the love from me... and now I'm going to take it back from them.<eos> You should understand what I'm talking about.<eos> You got replaced just like me!<eos> No! I'm nothing like you!<eos> Bratty kid!
You got replaced just like me!<eos> No! I'm nothing like you!<eos> Bratty kid!<eos> Let our parents go!<eos> His parents.
No! I'm nothing like you!<eos> Bratty kid!<eos> Let our parents go!<eos> His parents.<eos> The parents.
How do I look?<eos> You look great.<eos> Well, team, good job.<eos> Staci, this letter should get you into the school of your choice.<eos> - Kindergarten?
Don't worry. Baby Corp has a procedure for situations like this.<eos> It'll be like I was never born.<eos> I almost forgot!<eos> No way!<eos> Lam-Lam!
Luckily for me and my little brother, it had a happy ending.<eos> Is that a true story, Daddy?<eos> Well, sweetie, that's how I remember it.<eos> - But you know what I found out?<eos> - What?
Well, sweetie, that's how I remember it.<eos> - But you know what I found out?<eos> - What?<eos> There's plenty of love for everyone.<eos> Even me?
- But you know what I found out?<eos> - What?<eos> There's plenty of love for everyone.<eos> Even me?<eos> Especially you.
I did it because I wanted to!<eos> Dick.<eos> What are we even talking about this for?<eos> We just had a little man save us by blowing up 50 ships!<eos> How little?
I figured my rugged good looks would make that obvious.<eos> My name is Ego... and I'm your dad, Peter.<eos> You know what they say...<eos> "You're out of luck until you've gone duck."<eos> Yondu!
Yeah. I guess I feel a general, unselfish love for just about everybody.<eos> No!<eos> Romantic, sexual love.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> -For her!
Okay. whatever you say.<eos> You shut up.<eos> You're next.<eos> Udonta, I have waited a long time to do...<eos> What?
How do we kill a Celestial?<eos> There's a center to him.<eos> His brain, his soul, whatever it is... Some sort of protective shell.<eos> It's in the caverns... below the surface.<eos> Yondu?
I'm damn lucky you're my boy.<eos> What?<eos> Yondu, what are you doing?<eos> You can't.<eos> Yondu!
They are sending me back to Mars, aren't they?<eos> They did not say that.<eos> No they don't have to.<eos> There has been a breach here.<eos> Quarantine.
I am gonna miss you Gardner.<eos> More than anything else in the world.<eos> Me too.<eos> You're the best mom I never had.<eos> Safe travels ok?
we sent the 26 super piglets to the 26 countries where the Mirando offices are located.<eos> Each one was given to an esteemed local farmer. honoring traditional techniques unique to their respective cultures.<eos> My top scientists in the Mirando branch offices will be on hand to offer whatever support is required.<eos> These little piggies will be the ancestors of a whole new species.<eos> Mama Nature's gift.
It's okay.<eos> Not too hard!<eos> They're not even ripe yet.<eos> You had some already!<eos> Okja!
Son of a...<eos> Great.<eos> Now we can buy a new TV.<eos> This one's still fine.<eos> Such a tightwad...

Okay.<eos> but this was our plan.<eos> replace the black box and let Mirando retake Okja.<eos> You want to send Okja to America?<eos> To this laboratory? Yes.
Hold this.<eos> Get Okja on the phone now!<eos> I want to know how she's doing.<eos> On the phone?<eos> With a pig?
There she goes.<eos> - Okja gets to see everything.<eos> - Quiet.<eos> This is historical. It's historical. This is history.<eos> Okja!
Whatever. She says you should lift her ear and put the receiver underneath.<eos> - You're on speakerphone!<eos> - Okja!<eos> Okja!<eos> Okja!

Please note that Black Chalk was here exactly on time.<eos> don't touch her!<eos> put the gun down. It's okay.<eos> - Stop! Less violence!<eos> - No! No violence!
Did we get struck by lightning?<eos> Look at this... the VCR's toast. Uh, wait a sec... Where's Old Black Man?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> He's gone.<eos> What the hell? What?
The name!<eos> Giselle.<eos> I told Giselle!<eos> I'm going to stop you!<eos> Giselle!
Don't think it.<eos> Don't say it.<eos> Don't think it.<eos> Don't say it.<eos> Giselle!
The guy says it's fantastic.<eos> What else would he say, "It's a dog house"?<eos> No, I'm trying to convince her, let's go.<eos> Come on, man, work with me.<eos> - Sash?
Don't think it!<eos> "Don't say it! Don't think it!"<eos> Don't say or think what?<eos> The Bye Bye Man.<eos> What the fuck?
Guys, what are you doing up there?<eos> Anyone down there?<eos> Guys! Help!<eos> No!<eos> Guys!
What are you talking about?<eos> You didn't bring him here.<eos> - Don't you see it?<eos> - See what?<eos> The light...
Elliot! It's me!<eos> What the hell?<eos> Elliot, I don't understand.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Help!
What are you talking about?<eos> He must've left them out there for me to find.<eos> Left them out where, honey?<eos> In the little table.<eos> Outside, next to the trash cans.
Where have you been, Ben?<eos> Yeah, my new legally sanctioned business is tripling our revenue.<eos> Is that Mother's hat?<eos> Hello. I'd like to see Sheriff Truman.<eos> Which one?
Yeah, my new legally sanctioned business is tripling our revenue.<eos> Is that Mother's hat?<eos> Hello. I'd like to see Sheriff Truman.<eos> Which one?<eos> Which one?
Yeah, but what's it for?<eos> It's just a job I got to help with school.<eos> Whose place is this?<eos> I heard a billionaire.<eos> Some anonymous billionaire. Mysterious.
I just remembered. Barney's not here.<eos> He's a funny one, that Barney.<eos> He's in the hospital, not the regular hospital.<eos> Hey, Darlene, we're gonna need a locksmith over at 1349 Arrowhead, possible 1054.<eos> No, no, 1349.
Am I... am I free to go?<eos> Gentlemen, am... am I free to go?<eos> Harvey, you son of a bitch.<eos> Did you send the cops to my place of business?<eos> My work?
Sir?<eos> Is there anything we can do to help?<eos> Call for help.<eos> Call who?<eos> Who?
Home.<eos> And do you live around here?<eos> Where is your home?<eos> Lancelot Court. Cab ride.<eos> No, no, no. No cabs.
Dougie?<eos> Well, there's... there's enough here to pay them back.<eos> The... You could... We could...<eos> This is the most wonderful... horrible day of my life.<eos> Of my life.
I know.<eos> I'm speaking more as a woman now than as the chief of staff of the entire. Federal Bureau of Investigation.<eos> Don't you just love sometimes saying.<eos> "Federal Bureau of Investigation" like that all at once?<eos> Unabbreviated?
I know.<eos> Gordon, I trust you.<eos> You know that.<eos> And I believe you're on the trail of something big.<eos> Big.
Dougie, go.<eos> Come on, let's get you out of here.<eos> Come on. Let's go, Dougie. Right, right.<eos> Call for help.<eos> In the back, Jack.
Now, when you get to work, call them and set up a time and pay them their 50 grand, okay?<eos> Then we'll be free and clear.<eos> Okay, Dougie, you're acting weird as shit.<eos> Just don't forget to call them, okay?<eos> And no more drinking and gambling.
Work.<eos> Damn. Your car.<eos> Okay, get in.<eos> I'll drive you. Where is your car, anyway?<eos> In the car!
- Yeah, yeah.<eos> It's pretty damn good.<eos> Hey, thanks for coming in. I hope everything's okay.<eos> Yeah, no problem.<eos> Coffee?
Come on in.<eos> Ma'am?<eos> There's an envelope here for you.<eos> Thank you again.<eos> Good night. Good night, ma'am.
How do I know you know anything about... this?<eos> Joe McCluskey.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I want a car. Cheap rental, if you like.<eos> For myself and Ray Monroe.
Which we can take care of at your convenience.<eos> Please, give us a call in the morning.<eos> And, uh, thank you for your cooperation.<eos> Have a pleasant evening.<eos> Evening.
I heard you drive up.<eos> Why were you late?<eos> I had some things to do.<eos> Would you like your dinner?<eos> What things?
Farmers.<eos> Where are they?<eos> Oh, they're sleeping out back.<eos> What you need?<eos> A couple clean phones.
We'll get back to you as soon as we have something.<eos> Dougie, you can take the rest of the day off.<eos> Well, that's great, because I can take him to the doctor.<eos> Starting tomorrow, you and I are gonna work together and get some answers.<eos> Answers.
What happens in season two?<eos> Apologies in advance for Albert.<eos> Well, this is your Major Briggs.<eos> It turns out that William Hastings, along with the help of Ruth the librarian, was researching and publishing some strange little blog about some alternate dimension.<eos> This from the principal of your local high school.
Go away!<eos> Hey, Lucy.<eos> Sheriff Truman, I'm not here.<eos> I'm on my lunch break.<eos> Oh, Sheriff. Oh.
Oh, jeez.<eos> Could you get the door?<eos> Little help here?<eos> Bobby, open the window.<eos> No seams. No openings.
They checked everywhere.<eos> It seems to be loudest here.<eos> It's, um... it's kind of a mesmerizing tone.<eos> Yes. The ring out of a monastery bell has the same quality.<eos> Or the... hmm. Otherworldly.
There's literally nothing beneath us, except an infinite abyss that smells like dirty underwear.<eos> If Joker's bomb were to go off, these plates would break apart, plunging every Gotham citizen into the eternal abyss forever.<eos> And you wouldn't want that, now would you?<eos> Now get me the mayor!<eos> Joker out!
Oh, no.<eos> I'm sorry!<eos> Flying the mayor package in right now.<eos> SWAT team, get your stun guns ready!<eos> - Non-lethal. - Yeah!
Hurray! Batman!<eos> You did it!<eos> You're welcome.<eos> - Thank you, Batman.<eos> - Oh, my pleasure.
Batman, we love you!<eos> Thank you!<eos> I'm blushing super hard under the mask.<eos> - Grazie, Batman!<eos> - Prego.
Yeah. I love it.<eos> You can't spend the rest of your life alone, dressed in black, listening to angry music, and staying up all night.<eos> Yes, I can, 'cause I'm Batman.<eos> But don't you think it's time you finally faced your greatest fear?<eos> - Snakes?
I wanna hear all four points.<eos> - It's called... - I am ready.<eos> It takes a village...<eos> Best opening to a title ever.<eos> Not a Batman.
All right, listen up.<eos> All of you have the right to remain silent.<eos> Let's roll out!<eos> - Bye, Batman.<eos> - Au revoir, Batman.
You're satisfied serving me.<eos> So what do you know about having a surrogate son?<eos> Now, I'm gonna go fight crime while you put that kid on the next jet to the orphanage.<eos> As you wish, sir.<eos> Whoops-a-daisy.
- Sir, what are you doing?<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> Why is Master Dick dressed like that?<eos> How dare you tell me how to parent my kid I just met?<eos> To the Batmobile!
Yeah. Everybody say...<eos> Super Friends!<eos> Let me see it!<eos> Let me see! Classic! We got everyone.<eos> Yeah, everyone.
You want us to smite him?<eos> Well, yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> You want us to make the rivers of Gotham City run red with his blood?<eos> Oh, that's...<eos> Oh, no blood?
We're going to have to rename this the Butt-mobile.<eos> Hey, evil army.<eos> I need Batman brought here.<eos> Now go get him!<eos> Joker out!
Do you ever get scared?<eos> No.<eos> Yeah, that's what I figured, 'cause you're Batman.<eos> Hey, kid. You know who does get scared?<eos> Who?
No.<eos> Yeah, that's what I figured, 'cause you're Batman.<eos> Hey, kid. You know who does get scared?<eos> Who?<eos> Bruce Wayne.
Prove it.<eos> - Oh, I will.<eos> - Good. Do you know what the B-A-T in Batman stands for?<eos> - Not really.<eos> - Best At Teamwork.
What am I gonna do? Get a bunch of criminals together to fight the criminals?<eos> That's a stupid idea.<eos> Okay, guys. Game plan.<eos> Joker's taken the Projector<eos> - to Wayne Manor.
- We need that Projector.<eos> - Projector.<eos> Or there's no way<eos> - to blast these monsters...<eos> - Monsters. - ...back to the Phantom Zone.
- to blast these monsters...<eos> - Monsters. - ...back to the Phantom Zone.<eos> - Phantom Zone?<eos> Yep. Batman, I really don't need you to finish my...<eos> - Sand castles.
- Monsters. - ...back to the Phantom Zone.<eos> - Phantom Zone?<eos> Yep. Batman, I really don't need you to finish my...<eos> - Sand castles.<eos> - No. - Sister's homework.
And I mean all of them.<eos> One of these buttons has to save my friends.<eos> Self-destruct mode activated.<eos> Self what?<eos> - Master Dick!
Call it out!<eos> Your name is Lady Bat.<eos> - Lady Bat? - Bat Lady.<eos> - Veto! Nope.<eos> What? - El Batarina. Soccer Mom...
And you.<eos> So if you help me save Gotham, you'll help me save us.<eos> You just said "us."<eos> Yeah.<eos> Batman and the Joker.
I was just saying hello to the new guy.<eos> We're gonna get you cleaned up now.<eos> But first, I need you to swallow these.<eos> I'm going to need your support on buying this piece of property in Brooklyn.<eos> The warehouses?
I kept on falling, and... suddenly I looked up, and... there were these two men standing above me.<eos> Chodak and Tashi.<eos> And who were they?<eos> Monks.<eos> Order of the Crane Mother.
You're the first person to call me Danny in here.<eos> I need to get out of this place.<eos> Do you have any family you can call?<eos> No.<eos> Friends?
We're all connected.<eos> Chodak and Tashi.<eos> And who were they?<eos> Monks.<eos> Order of the Crane Mother.
I'm sure it was real nice to be part of that family.<eos> Have all the money in the world.<eos> Look how happy they seem.<eos> Sometimes, when our own lives are a struggle, it's... easier to imagine we belong to some other world.<eos> Some happier world.
And I thought you were dead, so I guess that's something we have in common.<eos> I didn't die.<eos> No, clearly not.<eos> Uh, I understand you were... taken in by some monks.<eos> What? Order of the, uh, Crane Mother?
With your backing, I can assure that he gets the long-term help that he needs.<eos> Heather!<eos> Special delivery.<eos> What is it?<eos> From Joy Meachum.
The Meachums are trying to bribe me.<eos> They got plenty of money.<eos> You gonna sign the papers?<eos> Are you dangerous?<eos> To them?
You gonna sign the papers?<eos> Are you dangerous?<eos> To them?<eos> Very dangerous.<eos> And to me?
Time to let me go.<eos> I'm gonna be making that decision very soon.<eos> I did a little research last night, and, uh, I want to ask you a few questions.<eos> When you were a kid, where did you go to school?<eos> Um... down the hall to our library.
Somewhere safe?<eos> We can't risk him falling into the hands of anyone else.<eos> He said he is the sworn enemy of the Hand.<eos> Do you realize how important that could be?<eos> No, not really.
I'll have all this solved by Friday.<eos> Door included.<eos> Then... Then I can pay you an entire year's rent.<eos> How does that sound?<eos> - Friday?
thanks.<eos> Your case is turning out to be more of a challenge than I thought.<eos> - How so?<eos> - There is no proof of Danny Rand anywhere.<eos> doctors' visits...
I looked up to you.<eos> What does that have to do with anything?<eos> I know you sent that guy.<eos> You were the only one with me the day I broke my arm.<eos> - What guy?
Take the offer and be thankful that we don't sue you.<eos> Ward...<eos> I'm glad you mentioned my sense of humor.<eos> I thought it was my ass.<eos> As for proof of identity...
You have no idea how long I've been waiting to hear that.<eos> wait.<eos> How are you still alive?<eos> I was diagnosed with cancer.<eos> pancreatic.
I've stepped way outside the code of Bushido.<eos> - It was a one-time mistake.<eos> - That's bullshit.<eos> - Why else are we learning to fight?<eos> - The scholarship.
I think I can handle it.<eos> I'll get it.<eos> light on the tonic.<eos> Danny!<eos> Back to the Golden Sands.
This drug will save millions of lives.<eos> - Wow.<eos> - Right? and be able to fund years' worth of new lab research.<eos> and he uses the full weight of his majority shareholdings to force us to sell the drug at cost.<eos> At cost.
I don't know.<eos> There's a bunch of Chinese restaurants with that name.<eos> Any of them attached to hatchet-wielding criminals?<eos> You know 'em?<eos> Triads.
Donkey's actually pretty good.<eos> My grandmother could stir fry the shit out of donkey and veggies.<eos> I'll take your word for it.<eos> When you weren't sneaking out... were you just waiting around... what, meditating?<eos> Not exactly.
Well, still... after everything you'd been through with the crash...<eos> I don't know, that would have been a really hard thing for me to have handled.<eos> I focused on my training.<eos> Anything that distracted me from that, I renounced.<eos> Material attachments, uh... indulgent activities, romantic entanglements.
It's Rand.<eos> Some bad people have gotten on the inside.<eos> Criminals.<eos> They're using the company as a cover to conduct their own business.<eos> What kind of business?
Fight strangers in cages.<eos> You think I'm proud of that?<eos> Come on. It is what it is.<eos> First time I fought in the cage... I convinced myself it was just about the money.<eos> For my students, for my dojo.
In this way, you are your own worst enemy.<eos> The time has come.<eos> The time has come.<eos> And this is why I tolerate no questioning from you... because doubt leads...<eos> To death.
You can't.<eos> This is for me only.<eos> - Danny...<eos> - I've been doing this for 15 years.<eos> But not against the Hand.
Come on, now.<eos> It's not that bad.<eos> Ward, Wayne Olsen.<eos> - Nice to meet you, Ward.<eos> - Likewise, Mr. Olsen.
I've mastered everything.<eos> Not everything.<eos> What else is there?<eos> You have yet to face the most cunning opponent of them all.<eos> The Hand.
There's no need to hide.<eos> I'm not hiding.<eos> Aren't you?<eos> Then why hide behind the mask of...<eos> Danny Rand?
I serve only myself.<eos> Prepare to disappoint your master.<eos> And who do you serve?<eos> I serve the one who called me here.<eos> Without question.
Prepare to disappoint your master.<eos> And who do you serve?<eos> I serve the one who called me here.<eos> Without question.<eos> Without doubt.
Why didn't you summon the Iron Fist?<eos> I can't.<eos> I just used it at the tournament.<eos> It drains my chi.<eos> The tournament?
Look, I'm sorry to cut this short, but there's somewhere else I really need to be.<eos> Oh, uh, and the assistants need their dental plan back, so we should probably get on that, too.<eos> Shit.<eos> Incredible.<eos> Just incredible.
Yeah, there's a warehouse in Brooklyn.<eos> Gao's been running a lot of our trucks through there in the past few days.<eos> It's possible this may be the manufacturing plant.<eos> - That's where she'll be keeping Radovan.<eos> - Who?
And as long as your hobby didn't interfere with our work... who was I to judge?<eos> But honestly, Ward, couldn't you have just gotten a mistress?<eos> Much simpler.<eos> I am sick of it!<eos> The control, the manipulation...
Call me or Colleen as soon as you get this.<eos> Harold?<eos> The hell is wrong with you?<eos> I thought you were one of them.<eos> - One of who?
Harold?<eos> The hell is wrong with you?<eos> I thought you were one of them.<eos> - One of who?<eos> - The Hand.
I don't want you guys in any more danger.<eos> The Hand thrives on fear.<eos> I can't keep running.<eos> I have to do this.<eos> For Louisa.
The Hand thrives on fear.<eos> I can't keep running.<eos> I have to do this.<eos> For Louisa.<eos> For myself.
I'm sorry.<eos> It's all right.<eos> I'm not sure there is a graceful way to handle this.<eos> Can I get anyone anything before we get started?<eos> Coffee?
But the other part wants to stay for me.<eos> For what I achieved.<eos> I earned my position.<eos> I'm not gonna just walk away.<eos> Not without a fight.
Why should we be enemies?<eos> And don't let the enemy bait you into a trap.<eos> Let's just take her in.<eos> I'm not turning her over to the police until I find out what I want to know.<eos> The police?
You don't know anything about me.<eos> You often find yourself fraternizing with people with gifts.<eos> Danny Rand.<eos> You secretly hope that the thing that makes them special and you have failed each of them in different ways.<eos> Bullshit.
Wendell.<eos> Wendell Rand.<eos> uh...<eos> This is my son's office.<eos> Ward.
How could they lose the company?<eos> it was the board.<eos> Voted them all out.<eos> Danny...<eos> - Danny?
Mmm-hmm. Probably.<eos> Hopefully, it won't come to that.<eos> Look, I know that secrets... secrets and lies have... they've taken a toll on our family.<eos> They've almost ruined us, but... I want a future free from all of that.<eos> For you, for me... for all of us.
Yes.<eos> Yes, it's all right. I told her everything.<eos> Hey, we're, uh, working on a plan to get Rand back, and, uh, you're a big part of that.<eos> Look, I'll get there as soon as I can.<eos> Hey, no excuses.
This is supposed to be the best... best single malt of all time.<eos> - Dad, it is too early to be drinking... - Come on. Open it.<eos> - and I'm... I can't. - One for you.<eos> One for me. Come on.<eos> - One for you, and one for me.
Oh... what are you proposing?<eos> Everything that is Gao's is now mine.<eos> You proceed as you have but with a different goal.<eos> And what would that be?<eos> A way out.
Everything that is Gao's is now mine.<eos> You proceed as you have but with a different goal.<eos> And what would that be?<eos> A way out.<eos> A return to public life for you.
Look, I understand, but I can't just leave.<eos> You had no trouble leaving us.<eos> - That's not true.<eos> - One day, you were just gone.<eos> Without a word.
And why you just showed up at my door, bleeding,<eos> - with a completely different mystery man.<eos> - Davos. - You mentioned that.<eos> - He's from K'un-Lun.<eos> The monastery?
I am so proud of you.<eos> The Hand has taken away so many years from us.<eos> And we're gonna to make 'em pay for it.<eos> Pay with everything they have.<eos> Hey, how about a juice?
Well, last time I drove with you, you wrecked Brother Kuo's cart, remember?<eos> You wanted to take the unpaved road around the lake because you thought you'd see the girls from the village bathing.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And all we saw was your dad doing his private meditations.<eos> - In the nude.
And all we saw was your dad doing his private meditations.<eos> - In the nude.<eos> - Yeah, I know, okay? I remember.<eos> Do you ever think that maybe the Thunderer was wrong?<eos> About certain things?
Good.<eos> I do have an immediate favor to ask of you.<eos> - And that is?<eos> - Help me capture the Iron Fist, and you and your sister will be safe.<eos> Bakuto...
Yeah, much better.<eos> I was hoping we could head out and catch up.<eos> Uh, yeah, definitely.<eos> But right now we're in the middle of something big.<eos> - What?
- I understand.<eos> Let's just go so we can talk, okay?<eos> - Where are we...<eos> - What's the problem, Ward?<eos> No problem.
You know, when I was a child, my mother told me the story of the Sack Man, a sort of bogeyman who shows up at disobedient children's homes and steals them away in his sack to sell them.<eos> It's nonsense, really, but it kept us in line.<eos> Nobody wanted to be captured by him.<eos> You want your own personal Sack Man?<eos> Oh, not just mine.
Ward.<eos> and you've always lost.<eos> this is your last chance to come on board.<eos> it's just me and Joy running this company.<eos> And not Danny?
and you've always lost.<eos> this is your last chance to come on board.<eos> it's just me and Joy running this company.<eos> And not Danny?<eos> Danny?
There's so much I don't know.<eos> Here it is.<eos> Gao?<eos> They left you here?<eos> No food? No water?
isn't it?<eos> Much easier to burn it in the flames of anger.<eos> You think you're so clever... with these little mind games.<eos> isn't it?<eos> Your thirst for vengeance.
I know.<eos> And I don't blame you.<eos> Then leave.<eos> I'm sorry about what happened.<eos> Which part?
We had the world at our feet.<eos> We were standing on that little ledge over there.<eos> And here's the funny part.<eos> I had this overwhelming urge to push Wendell over.<eos> No reason.
It's my choice!<eos> but you won't. That's why you're gonna die.<eos> Better that than to live like you.<eos> Hated by those who should love you no matter what.<eos> - Ward.
this is... still my father's body.<eos> And I didn't want to do this alone.<eos> Any news from Joy?<eos> No.<eos> Nothing.
This thing... throw it away.<eos> I'll get you a new one.<eos> See you.<eos> Bye bye.<eos> Goodbye, Director.
Long time no see.<eos> What gives? Want to ask you for a favor.<eos> What is it?<eos> I am in the Kunlun Mountains...<eos> Near the border of China and India?
Not a hole for oil. A hole in ice.<eos> Ice hole? We happen to have new equipment for that.<eos> I might have found some treasures.<eos> Treasure of what?<eos> Of ancient India's Magadha Kingdom.
Xiaoguang, I told you to keep an eye on them.<eos> Professor, since you went to catch the wolves, I had them make a few snowmen to scare off the wolves.<eos> Scare the wolves? - Yes.<eos> - Wolves are coming!<eos> Help!
Appreciate your hard work. OK!<eos> Goodbye!<eos> - OK. Thanks. - Take care of him.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Bye.
You family must have won many cars before.<eos> My dad's camel has never won yet.<eos> Faster! Faster!<eos> What is the remote control for?<eos> For the whipping.
The festival is tomorrow.<eos> Vedic designers made temples according to astronomical principles.<eos> There's a book about this.<eos> We can start from there.<eos> "Vastu Shastra".
He will climb up the rope?<eos> Come with me and you won't get hurt.<eos> Go!<eos> Go!<eos> Help!
Go!<eos> Go!<eos> Help!<eos> Stay away from Rope Trick.<eos> Help!
- Twenty.<eos> - Jesus.<eos> There's nobody fucking out there, man.<eos> - 'Less he's a pro.<eos> - A hajji?
Check out our boy with the radio;<eos> He got the call out?<eos> Yeah.<eos> That ain't a head shot, Ize.<eos> Okay, fine, so one without a fucking head shot.
Fuck.<eos> I'm getting closer here.<eos> You got eyes on that wall?<eos> Roger that.<eos> - Shit.
Break, break, break, spartan thirty tree,<eos> - requesting extraction.<eos> Break, break, break!<eos> Spartan three tree requesting extraction!<eos> Radio comm?
Ah...<eos> Huh.<eos> Fucking NATO round.<eos> Goddamn.<eos> 7.62x51.
Whatever, man.<eos> It's an interesting choice of words.<eos> And yet I disagree with you, bro.<eos> The war's not over.<eos> Definitely not for you.
A legend.<eos> Trained me.<eos> Trained Dean, too.<eos> He's coming for us.<eos> For your bodies.
He's in the trash!<eos> Under fire!<eos> Under fire!<eos> Brace!<eos> Brace!
And mine.<eos> You're not alone in this.<eos> So what?<eos> We just go and find a team to join?<eos> An army?
- Eleven million. - Yeah.<eos> You sure you want to stay pro bono?<eos> I'm just happy I could help.<eos> - Thanks, Josie. - Hmm.<eos> How about you?
But ain't nobody come asking me, okay?<eos> I'm too old-school for this anyway.<eos> What are they doing?<eos> And who are they doing it for?<eos> Some new guy.
- I told you to stay away.<eos> - Mr. Raymond, trust me.<eos> Right now, I wish I'd listened.<eos> Are you working with them?<eos> With who?
Time is not something I can afford to waste.<eos> Not for your benefit but for mine, I'm taking the blinds off.<eos> Try not to bite, old friend.<eos> It's undignified.<eos> Alexandra.
You are everything.<eos> It doesn't matter what you choose.<eos> You are the Black Sky.<eos> In the end, you are the weapon.<eos> Wakizashi.
You're better off not in prison.<eos> I like you here.<eos> What happened?<eos> I got clocked.<eos> - By White Hat? - No.
- Whoever hired you... - Man, would you wake up?<eos> They're watching everything.<eos> They got eyes and ears all over.<eos> And the longer you talk to me, the worse it looks.<eos> For the both of us.
- Daniel Rand, of Rand Enterprises.<eos> - Here to see?<eos> - The CEOs of Midland Circle Financial.<eos> - Are they expecting you?<eos> - Not like this.
Well, I'm alive.<eos> You?<eos> Just getting back into the world.<eos> - From where?<eos> - Prison.
They're in New York for a reason, but I don't know why.<eos> - What do you mean, "fanatical ideology"?<eos> - Gonna sound crazy...<eos> - What do they want?<eos> - Immortality.
- What do they want?<eos> - Immortality.<eos> They want power and influence at every level across the world.<eos> And I think they want me.<eos> - For your money?
They saw you fight.<eos> How you're hiding your face.<eos> They're two seconds away from figuring it out themselves.<eos> - What do you want from me?<eos> - Nothing.
You just can't help but wonder.<eos> The woman who lived in this vessel, she was lost before she came to us.<eos> She was led astray by men who were afraid of what she was, of what she was capable of doing.<eos> But destiny is a curious thing, because this vessel landed right where it belongs.<eos> With us.
The woman who lived in this vessel, she was lost before she came to us.<eos> She was led astray by men who were afraid of what she was, of what she was capable of doing.<eos> But destiny is a curious thing, because this vessel landed right where it belongs.<eos> With us.<eos> With me.
They wanted to use it to heal.<eos> But there were five heretics among them, people with darker intentions.<eos> They didn't want to heal.<eos> They wanted immortality.<eos> Power.
You serious?<eos> Look, all I'm saying is, like it or not... we're walking the same path.<eos> We fix this thing together.<eos> Then that path comes to an end.<eos> Last one?
I'm glad you found others.<eos> Don't act like this is normal.<eos> Don't act like I don't know what's really going on with you.<eos> You crossed paths with her, too?<eos> With who?
You had no choice in returning from death.<eos> I realize that.<eos> But I hope you understand that this is the life you were chosen to lead, as a weapon against our enemies.<eos> If you do not fulfill that role... you're of no use to the Hand.<eos> Or to me.
I'm not doing this for you.<eos> It's just... self-preservation at this point.<eos> You deserve better, Karen.<eos> So do you.<eos> - Misty.
I know you don't wanna be here, but it seems that you are all of interest to some pretty powerful and dangerous people.<eos> Now, to protect you, I need your cooperation.<eos> Sit tight for now.<eos> We'll have more answers soon.<eos> Hopefully.
Hmm, yes, that was our assignment.<eos> She could lead us to the Iron Fist.<eos> - And she did.<eos> In fact...<eos> - Along with his allies.
- We know, and we plan to correct it.<eos> We will discuss your failure to acquire a few bargaining chips next.<eos> But first...<eos> The Iron Fist has a new partner in his fight.<eos> Daredevil.
Let's not kid each other.<eos> This is personal for every one of us.<eos> But now I have the Iron Fist.<eos> The key to what the Hand seeks.<eos> The key to life, to our salvation.
Yeah, well, we knew that.<eos> We didn't know the Iron Fist was the key to what the Hand seeks.<eos> The word isn't accidental.<eos> You think he's a key?<eos> To what, their survival?
I think it's up here.<eos> - You think?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> All these brownstones look the same, don't they?<eos> Oh, shit.
I bet that must've hurt.<eos> Like you wouldn't believe.<eos> I took a direct hit from a rocket launcher once.<eos> Got blasted in the face with a shotgun.<eos> By Jessica.
Like you wouldn't believe.<eos> I took a direct hit from a rocket launcher once.<eos> Got blasted in the face with a shotgun.<eos> By Jessica.<eos> Our Jessica?
It's nothin' compared to what comes next.<eos> What's with the incense?<eos> Helps me meditate.<eos> Ask for guidance.<eos> Forgiveness.
That is the nicest thing you've ever said to me.<eos> Yeah, don't get used to it.<eos> So much smoke.<eos> What is this stuff?<eos> Eh, little of this, little of that.
He's in danger.<eos> - Who?<eos> - Danny Rand.<eos> Uh, they took him.<eos> - The billionaire?
So I need you to answer this fast.<eos> How long you want me to stall 'em?<eos> That can't be good. Nope.<eos> Hey. Yeah, it's Karen.<eos> Yeah, our lights, too.
- When?<eos> - About an hour or so ago.<eos> They just discovered it.<eos> The C-4 is missing.<eos> The stuff from the motel?
You can't rely on her to... move a couch or plan a party, but... when it comes to the real stuff... the stuff that'll last forever...<eos> Uh, ladies?<eos> We just heard a dispatcher call for all available units.<eos> - To where?<eos> - Hell's Kitchen.
Some place called Midland Circle.<eos> 44th and 11th Avenue.<eos> - Midland Circle.<eos> - That was the epicenter.<eos> Of what?
44th and 11th Avenue.<eos> - Midland Circle.<eos> - That was the epicenter.<eos> Of what?<eos> Everything.
You just don't make the headlines.<eos> You're going to make me blush.<eos> This is it.<eos> How do we know what we're looking for?<eos> Oh.
- The only way out of here is together.<eos> Danny, light it up.<eos> Now.<eos> - Remember this?<eos> - Just like old times.
Take care.<eos> And keep fighting the good fight for him.<eos> How do you feel?<eos> Great.<eos> Not quite whole.
It's not.<eos> It's the job.<eos> Danny... uh, wanted to say that he has connections... at this hospital, and it's a...<eos> It's a state-of-the-art kind of place, so...<eos> "Connections"?
Not mutually exclusive.<eos> Needs of the society or needs of the individual?<eos> - Should be the same.<eos> - You're most scared of?<eos> Unfulfilled potential.
Um, that is when you send the survey.<eos> The survey is a set of quick questions about, you know, your overall service, how you did, and they send that immediately back and you get to see how you did right here. That is the rating. Uh, you know what?<eos> Let's just do a live one.<eos> - Excuse me. Okay.<eos> ...nice day.
Don't you have to go and chop some wood or something?<eos> - Thanks, hon.<eos> - Sure, Dad.<eos> His business is doing well.<eos> Mercer?
Is that related to his MS?<eos> Uh... yeah.<eos> We didn't know anything about this incident.<eos> Did you reach out to any Circlers during this crisis?<eos> Annie, anybody? Uh, no, I...
Like what, connecting the world?<eos> Insuring my parents?<eos> You should be really proud of what you created.<eos> No, proud?<eos> Proud of what? The disregard for privacy?
I borrowed a kayak without the owner's knowledge, paddled out to the middle of the bay... and I wasn't wearing a life jacket.<eos> Well, I'm not sure that's exactly a capital offense, but you did risk your own life.<eos> So, Mae, do you think you behave better or worse when you are being watched?<eos> Better.<eos> Without a doubt.
Annie!<eos> Annie Allerton!<eos> Are we alone?<eos> I have three minutes to use the bathroom without the video on.<eos> Ugh.
Stop the clock.<eos> SoulSearch, baby! I guess that's it!<eos> Let's do another!<eos> We could...<eos> Maybe not a fugitive this time.
- Fire in the hole.<eos> Guys, guys, guys, listen, listen.<eos> There's a girl. She's coming, okay?<eos> There's a girl...<eos> Mandy.
- We don't actually make love...<eos> - He's the power bottom.<eos> - Now he generates a tremendous amount of power...<eos> - Yeah. No, I...<eos> - ...from the bottom.
Yeah, I, uh... I sleep with women, but I'm emotionally involved with Mac, which is why... and this is the hard part...<eos> I don't have room emotionally in my life for you.<eos> Okay.<eos> Uh...<eos> Wow.
Oh, no, um...<eos> I hadn't thought about it, but you can stay here.<eos> - I mean, that's fine.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Oh, wow.
Oh, good-bye.<eos> - Good-bye.<eos> - Good-bye.<eos> - Hmm.<eos> - Bye.
Sir, why don't we just give it back?<eos> He killed my nephew.<eos> My brother.<eos> And a dozen of my men.<eos> Over his car.
He killed my nephew.<eos> My brother.<eos> And a dozen of my men.<eos> Over his car.<eos> And a puppy.
This is what you agreed to, Jonathan.<eos> Do what the man asks.<eos> Be free.<eos> Then, if you want to go after him, burn his house down, be my guest.<eos> But until then...
You're thinking about it, aren't you?<eos> You're counting exits... guards...<eos> Could you get to me in time?<eos> How would you do it, I wonder?<eos> That woman's pen?
Flared magwell for easier reloads.<eos> And I know you'll appreciate the custom porting.<eos> What's next?<eos> I need something robust.<eos> Precise.
Yes.<eos> Bourbon, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I had a marker.<eos> Whose?
Bourbon, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I had a marker.<eos> Whose?<eos> Her brother.
Mr. Wick?<eos> If you would be so inclined.<eos> Come on, boy.<eos> It has been a pleasure, Mr. Wick.<eos> Goodbye.
Accounts payable.<eos> One one, one one, one.<eos> In one hour.<eos> John Wick.<eos> Excommunicado.
- Oh, yeah.<eos> It's totally dry.<eos> - Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - It's not, it's not... no, but it's not, it's, it's not open yet.<eos> It's Thunder Gun, man.<eos> No hesitation.
What do you mean?<eos> Where you going?<eos> We're just getting started.<eos> Yeah, but my mom said it's time to leave.<eos> Wow.
Yeah, yeah, just give me a good push on...<eos> W-what are you doing?<eos> Wh-what, that fart?<eos> I'm just trying some new stuff.<eos> No, n-n-not the fart, no.
- Frank, is that you?<eos> Hey, come help me out, I'm stuck.<eos> Not now, Deandra.<eos> Oh, by the way, none of the stuff you're doing is playing.<eos> Except for the fart stuff.
Never moved.<eos> Never blinked.<eos> Gives me goose bumps just thinking about it.<eos> He had all the right answers, but my gut told me this guy was guilty.<eos> Of something.
Yeah, but weren't you just saying that you were doing deposits before maturity?<eos> Uh, no, no, no, no.<eos> See, that's where you're wrong.<eos> No, I was, uh, between the ages of 18 and 21, simply making investments.<eos> But not for early deposits?
Oh.<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> So, right.<eos> So you thought we would care about the smell of cigarettes,<eos> - but not the smell of skunk or dog shit. - Mm.
- Are you kidding me?<eos> - I'm a hero! - Oh!<eos> You bitch!<eos> - 50/50 split?<eos> - ...out of the way!
Think about his mom and his dad.<eos> How long they been playing this for?<eos> Oh, dude... three straight days.<eos> They've been playing this<eos> - for three days?
- What do you want to tell us?<eos> Just tell us.<eos> - Oh, you're dating a stripper.<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> Wow, gross.
Just tell us.<eos> - Oh, you're dating a stripper.<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> Wow, gross.<eos> Gross?
Ch-Charlie, I need a new keg.<eos> - This one's tapped, buddy.<eos> - Yeah, give me a second.<eos> Like, if Jerry jumped off a bridge would you jump off it, too?<eos> - Which bridge? - Guys, guys...
- This one's tapped, buddy.<eos> - Yeah, give me a second.<eos> Like, if Jerry jumped off a bridge would you jump off it, too?<eos> - Which bridge? - Guys, guys...<eos> - Which bridge, really?
All right? So, can we not remind them of that with inky beer?<eos> All right, fine.<eos> Can you just tell him to get lost, then?<eos> And then we'll go back to the way things were.<eos> - Who?
All right, fine.<eos> Can you just tell him to get lost, then?<eos> And then we'll go back to the way things were.<eos> - Who?<eos> - Jerry.
Can you just tell him to get lost, then?<eos> And then we'll go back to the way things were.<eos> - Who?<eos> - Jerry.<eos> - The worm?
- FRANK: Done, done, done.<eos> - Done with my work.<eos> - Oh, Christ, they're like dominoes.<eos> Frank, you're not done<eos> - until the end of the day.
- Oh!<eos> Of emotions.<eos> Of what?<eos> - It's a metaphor.<eos> - For what?
And you said you loved me!<eos> - Ew!<eos> (Dee laughing) - You bitch!<eos> Look, that song was derivative of a song I wrote<eos> - for the waitress, anyway, then.
There's never anything insi...<eos> What is this?<eos> It's a gift.<eos> I got it for you.<eos> For me?
Mac, I don't care.<eos> I love it.<eos> You figured out the one thing I wanted more than anything else in the entire world and you got it for me.<eos> And it's perfect.<eos> Happy Valentine's Day.
Good.<eos> How did you make out with those manuscripts?<eos> Oh, really great, actually.<eos> This one, um...<eos> Boyce fox.
I'm really sorry about your mother.<eos> It's in the past.<eos> Now, I brought you here to negotiate.<eos> You're open to new terms?<eos> No rules. No punishments.
It's in the past.<eos> Now, I brought you here to negotiate.<eos> You're open to new terms?<eos> No rules. No punishments.<eos> No rules, no punishments and no more secrets.
No rules, no punishments and no more secrets.<eos> I can do that.<eos> You want a...<eos> What do you call it?<eos> A vanilla relationship?
How do you put up with him?<eos> Do you know he was an even bigger pain as a teenager?<eos> He got expelled from four different schools for brawling.<eos> That's enough.<eos> Yeah, totally out of control.
New York. Book expo. This Friday.<eos> It's in the diary.<eos> No, yeah, I know.<eos> Yeah, i booked your room. Of course.<eos> And you.
You can't keep me locked up in your penthouse.<eos> What if I gave you a key?<eos> I mean, what if you had a key, and you kept some of your stuff here?<eos> Keep all of your stuff here and you slept, you know...<eos> Not at your place.
Sip isn't recruiting right now, so we're screwed.<eos> So you don't need me anymore then?<eos> I'm gonna try to find you something temporary.<eos> Could you fill in for Jack at this morning's meeting?<eos> At the senior editors' meeting?
Focus on our core readership.<eos> Expand it.<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> Um, uh... so, Ana, what do you think we should be publishing?<eos> Um, newer voices.
He talks about you all the time.<eos> He cares about you.<eos> Don't lie.<eos> Tell me what you have that I don't.<eos> Nothing.
I'm not a dominant.<eos> I'm not.<eos> The right term is a sadist.<eos> I get off on punishing women. Women who look like you...<eos> Like your mother.
Just turn it down please, José.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You're shivering.<eos> I'll get you a sweater, okay?<eos> Ana. Tea.
I'm not tired.<eos> No.<eos> It's your birthday.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Happy birthday.
He asked for your hand?<eos> That's so chivalrous.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> Champagne, Mr. grey?
Sure.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Christian.<eos> Mom.<eos> Happy birthday.
Hang on.<eos> - We did it.<eos> - Yeah, 46th time's the charm.<eos> Can't you just enjoy it for once?<eos> Oh, so sweet of you.
Ah, teenagers.<eos> So annoying, right? -Okay.<eos> See you later, guys.<eos> -Oh, uh, you're going out again?<eos> -Yeah.
Yeah. Go!<eos> -What do we do, Chief Chief?<eos> -Catch them.<eos> And bring that freak back alive.<eos> The sergeant?
- What?<eos> - Yummy.<eos> I can't wait to eat.<eos> Quick, get out!<eos> Tasty.
We're on the other side.<eos> Look.<eos> You see? We just have to follow their tracks.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Oh, please.
Okay, we'll spend the night here.<eos> -We need to regain our strength.<eos> -Really? Yay!<eos> The desert is ruthless.<eos> Even to its own children.
We don't do a lot of surfing over here.<eos> Well, looks like we'll die in the storm anyway.<eos> Besides, I-<eos> - Wait, what?<eos> Ready?
- Swim!<eos> - I'm trying!<eos> Come inside!<eos> Okay, we've gotta find the man who kidnapped Eva.<eos> -Uh, Omar?
When was the last stranger rape round here?<eos> We don't know it was, until we get more information.<eos> We can't know if she knew her attacker or not.<eos> I'm not saying it is, I'm asking when the last one was.<eos> Well, not in my career.
I've been given your number.<eos> I think you might be expecting my call.<eos> I was hoping to come and see you either today or tomorrow so, if you want to give me a call back, my number here is 01632 960131.<eos> Look forward to talking.<eos> Thanks. Bye.
Exterior scene, middle of nowhere, open to the elements, already two days behind before we've even started.<eos> Confirm the blood traces found on the stones match Trish's.<eos> Is this where she was unconscious?<eos> We don't have that information.<eos> Likely somewhere by the house.
- Can you make it quick? - No.<eos> Can we talk in private?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> One of your staff members, Trish Winterman, she won't be in for a while.<eos> Erm... Personal reasons.
It's unclear whether her attacker was known to her.<eos> Myself and DS Miller took her to the SARC in Poole last night.<eos> We're awaiting preliminary forensics and SOCO are starting work at the scene now.<eos> - When did she report this?<eos> - Last night.
All right, you know what? You're gonna find this interesting.<eos> So I googled "first graders who yelled at the principal"<eos> And statistically you will never believe how many kids do it.<eos> How many?<eos> None.
Fred's not the killer. He's a lover.<eos> Would mom want me to go to school?<eos> I can only guess.<eos> But I will tell you that, she would have wanted you to have friends.<eos> Idiot friends?
That's not what I said.<eos> Did you mean it?<eos> Last week you said I was the worst uncle in the world... and you wished the dead of me, cause I didn't buy you a piano.<eos> Did you mean that?<eos> No. Not entirely.
Nope. Frank says I'm not going anywhere.<eos> Your uncle told you you're not going anywhere?<eos> Just 15 minutes ago.<eos> So, are we done here?<eos> Not quite yet.
I have no desire to hurt you.<eos> I hate it that we're at odds.<eos> We're always at odds.<eos> Yes.<eos> Hotel.
You're being modest, aren't you?<eos> You were a professor at Boston University...<eos> Isn't that right? Yes, weel, assistant professor.<eos> And what'd you teach?<eos> Philosophy.
It's all I ask.<eos> d Fly away litlle prety bird d d Fly.<eos> So, while I'm trying to sell you on the house... and us... I just don't want you to think that we're completely insesitive... to what the feeling.<eos> You guys gonna be okay with the cat?<eos> Absolutely.
I tried, but it's not up to me.<eos> I even asked them to send me with you..<eos> Or anyone.<eos> In Amazon..<eos> The Amazons.

Germany is giving up.<eos> Von Hindenburg has recommended the Kaiser sign the armistice.<eos> We have run out of time.<eos> As soon as the Kaiser sees the newest weapon... he will not sign the armistice.<eos> But without my notebook...
I know what you can and will succeed...<eos> It is what you're put on this earth to do.<eos> Something, did come to me last night.<eos> A different type of gas.<eos> For you.
The last war took everything from my people.<eos> We have nothing left.<eos> At least here... I'm free.<eos> Who took that from your people?<eos> His people.
Did you find Ludendorff's operation?<eos> No. No, but I located him.<eos> And oh, lucky you, he's only a few miles away... At German High Command.<eos> The German High Command?<eos> And to Intel report...
Do you have dancing on... Paradise Island?<eos> Oh, dancing, yeah of course.<eos> These people are just... swaying.<eos> Okay, if you're gonna be fighting the God of war... I might as well teach you how to dance, you poor thing.<eos> Alright, probably without the gun.
What was transmitted to Langley?<eos> I'm pulling it up now.<eos> Langley feed playback, begin.<eos> I'm just glad to be back on friendly shores.<eos> Preach.
Almost ready, Chief.<eos> I knew when I saw Ahmadi that somebody was gonna have to pay for this shit.<eos> Isaac.<eos> Just like last time.<eos> No witnesses.
Christ, you're gonna be a grandfather.<eos> Go on.<eos> Do not come tomorrow, I know you.<eos> This is wsny and wsny hd Columbus.<eos> Merry Christmas from 795!
She was pregnant.<eos> Olena went to pick her up, to bring her back.<eos> Are this address and contact number correct?<eos> And are there any other family members we should inform?<eos> No - nobody?
We'll just make it normal for him.<eos> Jake, I think you just need some time to focus on you.<eos> Because if we keep living like this I think we'll just keep hurting each other and, you know, we'll get to a point where I don't know if we can fix it.<eos> So we're gonna do this for Samuel.<eos> And for us.

They could trust their instincts.<eos> My instincts! My instincts told me that you wanted Jason.<eos> You wanted a big alpha sex bloke.<eos> A sex bloke?<eos> Yeah! A strong man. Not a fucking puppy.
We found it near the body.<eos> It's been bent out of shape.<eos> And no identification on the victim?<eos> We have no idea who the dead man is.<eos> No. None.
- He did.<eos> - What?<eos> He said goodbye yesterday. On the glacier.<eos> You saw him?<eos> Hildy...

Let's go girls.<eos> So your Intel was spot on...<eos> A Democly 7 EMP weapon that went missing in the Gulf.<eos> Arms dealer from the Liberation front have it in Berlin.<eos> - Shit.
Mr Nobody and I have been given the authority to get you out of this.<eos> All you have to do is agree to the terms and you're free.<eos> Restraining wills, talking about, what terms?<eos> Confess to your crimes in Berlin.<eos> Treason, international espionage.
All you have to do is agree to the terms and you're free.<eos> Restraining wills, talking about, what terms?<eos> Confess to your crimes in Berlin.<eos> Treason, international espionage.<eos> Massive destruction of civic property.
Cut 'em loose.<eos> Oh man, this is embarrassing.<eos> I'm sorry guys, what do I have?<eos> This is how you treat old friends?<eos> Friend?
- What?<eos> Well, thanks to your bust Berlin job. You all made interpol's top 10 most wanted list.<eos> Top 10?<eos> Uh-huh. That's alright.<eos> Well, not you.
I thought his father should give him first name.<eos> I'm sorry, Dom.<eos> There is nothing to be sorry for.<eos> Whatever happens... Just save our son.<eos> Your son.
And theoretically, if you know the right people who...<eos> Know the right patterns.<eos> You can fly right through the blind's box... can't be intercepted.<eos> So you know where Dom is headed?<eos> Yeah, New York.
6.6 liter V8 Duramax engine.<eos> With the M153 probe remotely operated weapon station on top.<eos> You didn't get this from drug dealers.<eos> No.<eos> No that...
His bold actions saved the lives of hostages and his team mates.<eos> Recommendation:<eos> Victoria Cross.<eos> Highest honor the British Government has ever given.<eos> To a traitor.
It's a biological lie.<eos> You don't have to accept it.<eos> I don't!<eos> Did you really could think you could destroy two of my teams.<eos> Without any repercussions?
That's so limited.<eos> I didn't take that football to start a war.. Anymore than I took your son to start a family.<eos> Taking your son got me the codes..<eos> The codes will get me the nukes, and the nukes will get me what I want...<eos> Today, tomorrow... and every day after that.
Accountability.<eos> The second I fire off one of those nukes.. I put the superpowers of this world on notice that... when they cross the line,<eos> I'm gonna be there to hold the responsible..<eos> Because the truth is, Dom...<eos> To the world out there...
So, any other suggestions?<eos> Yeah, I got one.<eos> How about we just stop them ourselves?<eos> You're talking about a Russian Military Base.<eos> Separatists.
We are about to launch a nuclear missile, what the hell is going on.<eos> Pull the damn chip.<eos> Countdown.<eos> Countdown. Look for a countdown.<eos> What countdown?
Guys, we got snow mobile on the right.<eos> They're going to flank us.<eos> No they ain't!<eos> Oh shit!<eos> Tej!

Oh Shit.<eos> Roman, hang on.<eos> Tej!<eos> Get me off this thing.<eos> Tej.

Not by a long shot.<eos> Why you throwing your whole life away?<eos> Look, I don't know what they're holding over you... but I can offer you something better.<eos> Something real.<eos> No bluffs, no BS.
All right, well, pleasure to meet you.<eos> - You, too. - Yeah.<eos> - Thanks for the ride.<eos> - No problem, just doing my job.<eos> - Goodbye.

Don't leave!<eos> - Rajeesh.<eos> - I didn't see anything.<eos> - See what?<eos> - Anything.
Go, bro.<eos> Last night, their house got robbed.<eos> They took that TV, that stereo system and that Xbox.<eos> But the most important thing that they took was my dog.<eos> Buddy.
- $3,000? - $4,000.<eos> - You just said, $3,000.<eos> - You just fucked up my window.<eos> - You gave that dog to me.<eos> - Cállate.
Wow, where'd you get this? Some drug lord?<eos> Nah. You remember Dana Kaminski?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Well, her old man was a cop.<eos> Sweet.
I was planning on using that later.<eos> Is there a back door to this place?<eos> Man, fuck you.<eos> - Thanks very much. - You're really good.<eos> Fuck you.
You know that I lay with you when I was just a little boy.<eos> Where did you get the key?<eos> This key? This is my father's key.<eos> Horace Delaney.<eos> Shit.
You're a liar just like your father.<eos> You're a Delaney. Tell you what...<eos> You get me an address, and I will get you payment in the form of a banker's draft.<eos> How much?<eos> Good day.
When you first came back, you told me you loved me.<eos> There is no us.<eos> I'm investigating the sinking of a sloop called the Cornwallis.<eos> I want you to write an account naming Sir Stuart Strange as the man who organised the loading with slaves.<eos> For the safe.
I remember it all.<eos> I need a ship. You have four hours.<eos> Brace? I'm going out.<eos> I need to see someone.<eos> From Mr Delaney.
On you.<eos> Brighton, Martinez, shut the street down, we're expecting visitors!<eos> Come on, shift it! Everyone else, you heard the man, off the streets!<eos> Yes?<eos> From Mr Delaney.
The record will show that the EIC cooperated with your commission into the sinking of the Influence, fully and without reservation.<eos> You're an idealist.<eos> Delaney and I are realists.<eos> But the difference between Delaney and me is that I always make sure I have one last ace to play.<eos> Good day, Mr Chichester.
There's just a small hurdle that you have to leap over first.<eos> Take a look.<eos> It's a deed of transfer.<eos> Transferring my title to Nootka Sound to the East India Company?<eos> And your friend, Stuart Strange.
Fuck Nootka!<eos> Fuck wills! Fuck treaties!<eos> I'm the head of fucking state!<eos> And by the command of His Majesty Kill him.<eos> Mary, Mary, out of the way!
They got to him first.<eos> Either in Africa or on the journey back to London.<eos> One of their agents approached him, briefed him, gave him money and secured his services.<eos> Who, who did, sir?<eos> The fucking Americans!
Human kindness.<eos> An ant.<eos> Was he a company man?<eos> I'd say he wasn't East India.<eos> More from up Leadenhall.
Do you have a girl here called Winter?<eos> You can have any girl you want.<eos> I do not have a girl of that name.<eos> No?<eos> A mulatto?
Something the British are trying to kill me for.<eos> And what?<eos> You seek protection?<eos> I have demands.<eos> Demands?
Just keep walking.<eos> You're mad to have even come here.<eos> We are an angry nation.<eos> I'm counting on it.<eos> Good day.
He's already haunted.<eos> Come.<eos> Be sure of this, Delaney!<eos> That legacy is your death sentence!<eos> Out of my way!
- And Mary.<eos> - Thank you so much.<eos> Now, if you will excuse me, ladies.<eos> Come on.<eos> Posy for the lady?
Now, if you will excuse me, ladies.<eos> Come on.<eos> Posy for the lady?<eos> Much obliged, kind sir.<eos> For you.
In the absence of a chimpanzee, a gorilla will have to do.<eos> Please, madam, please, sir, take a deep breath... and step into the beyond.<eos> One wonders if they will ever be seen again!<eos> I did my research on you. Genevieve Decoux.<eos> From New Orleans.
What is it you're looking for?<eos> The Nootka Sound treaty.
On my instruction, the duellists will take up position at the points.<eos> Anyone firing à I'outrance will be fair game to be shot.<eos> You will duel to first blood...<eos> To the death!<eos> To first blood.
I can only assume that your second is a Company man.<eos> Since he failed to load a ball in your pistol.<eos> Dear God!<eos> It would appear that my life is more precious than yours.<eos> Good day.
Running by the window.<eos> Out there on the foreshore.<eos> Stopping the river traffic and searching every barge going east.<eos> You see, Miss Bow, last night there was a robbery.<eos> From the East India Arsenal.
You see, Miss Bow, last night there was a robbery.<eos> From the East India Arsenal.<eos> Ingredients for making gunpowder, stolen from under the Company's noses.<eos> Insurrectionists, they say.<eos> Frenchmen.
I don't.<eos> In the day?<eos> Or the night.<eos> For nine years, Mr. Chichester, you have been writing to my office on an annual basis.<eos> Every year, July 10th.
Mr. Coop, even though I am black, I am not related by blood to every slave stolen from Africa.<eos> So, The Sons of Africa. You write on their behalf.<eos> I write on behalf of humanity.<eos> As a man concerned with injustice.<eos> Against your people.

It is my belief that some very powerful men in London were involved in an illicit shipment of slaves for personal profit, were complicit in the deaths of those slaves and in the subsequent concealment of the facts.<eos> And you believe that those men are senior directors within the Honourable East India Company?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> Well then, Mr. Chichester, I have some good news for you.<eos> From the Prince Regent himself.
Go away, Winter.<eos> I'm not scared of you.<eos> What are you scared of?<eos> Of who they say you are.<eos> The African devil.
All was ordered and calm and now there is this thing that demands attention.<eos> Stops you sleeping, belches, farts, screams... and she's going to make this whole process louder and wilder, more insane, more impractical... and the only thing that will stop this entire enterprise from erupting in a giant explosion the size of Mauritius is this... and dedication.<eos> Because, from now on, until the powder is complete, we have to stir.<eos> Continuously!<eos> You.

Nothing.<eos> You stay here.<eos> I will tell Brace to arrange a carriage.<eos> By the time you get home, the body will be gone.<eos> Home?
The truth.<eos> Those bastards at the Palace have opened a Royal Commission into the sinking of the Influence.<eos> You are now one of us.<eos> You'll risk the life of your son?<eos> Zilpha.
You're among them now, aren't you?<eos> The ones who used to sing to me.<eos> Was it my hand...?<eos> Brace!<eos> God's sake.
No, you can't do this.<eos> Not now.<eos> It is done.<eos> Please...<eos> For your widowhood.
It is done.<eos> Please...<eos> For your widowhood.<eos> Now... I have work to do, so please excuse me.<eos> - No fires within these walls.
What's that?<eos> Your father's buttons... from his dress coat.<eos> I kept them.<eos> It was a kindness.<eos> For who?
The King gets the land.<eos> You get the tea trade.<eos> You got lucky with a whore, Stuart.<eos> Well, there was an element of fortune.<eos> And an element of God's grace.
Since it is imperative that we keep you alive until after your conviction for treason, the doctor is here to help and assist Mr. Arrow, who will do most of the necessary work.<eos> Although, for some tasks, he will need helpers with strong hands.<eos> And together, they will walk you along a tightrope. A line between life... and death.<eos> We need the names of all the people who helped you manufacture the gunpowder... move the gunpowder, but most pressingly of all, we need the names of all the members of the Society of Secret Correspondence that you have dealt with.<eos> The Americans.
Tell me what you want in return for Nootka.<eos> What's your price?<eos> I don't have a price.<eos> So what do you want?<eos> Tea.
It's tender.<eos> Did you bring me salt beef?<eos> - Pork.<eos> - No.<eos> Fresh from a sloop from somewhere cold.
- A boat.<eos> - I know it's a boat. Does it float?<eos> - Yeah, yeah, of course.<eos> - How many will it take?<eos> - Us.
You have a problem, the King really does not.<eos> I received a letter from Delaney this morning.<eos> I suppose you would call it a pincer movement.<eos> He says he's happy for the Nootka trading post, the smoke house and the tanning factory to be incorporated into the territory of the British Crown, but only if we give him a monopoly on the trade in smoked sea otter pelts from...<eos> Canton?
Only Atticus delivers.<eos> She's only ever taken one coach.<eos> Why?<eos> Because tonight she stabbed the Duke of Richmond.<eos> For what reason?
You want me to get him and bring him here?<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Did we ask her to tell him her life story?<eos> For four fuckin' hours?<eos> Warrick?
It's never done that before.<eos> We're supposed to get some coffee, But I don't think that's a good idea.<eos> Coffee?<eos> I would like some coffee. Maybe some warm milk.<eos> For the cat.
Dougie, it's 5:30. Where are you going?<eos> You've got the check, don't you?<eos> Yeah, you're all set.<eos> Where you taking him?<eos> Santino's.
And our money.<eos> Candie.<eos> Candie.<eos> Another piece of pie for our friend.<eos> Friend.
Good to see you again. Wish it was under better circumstances.<eos> Yeah. I'll let you know if, uh... if I hear from him.<eos> I'll let you know if we have more news.<eos> Thanks, Frank.<eos> For Harry.
Dougie even implicated himself.<eos> And he showed me how you manipulated claims, and you cost me plenty.<eos> I trusted you, Anthony.<eos> I looked at you as my friend and my number-one sales agent.<eos> Number-one sales agent.
And then, in that moment,<eos> "Once you've got the glove on," go to Twin Peaks, Washington, United States of America.<eos> And there, "you will find your destiny."<eos> So here I am, Jimmy, on your birthday.<eos> Many happy returns.
Where'd you lift that?<eos> It's Paula's.<eos> It's nice.<eos> Have you seen Billy?<eos> No, not for a couple of days.
I hear her bags are going for $1000.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Good for her.<eos> I always knew she would make it.<eos> Hello, ladies.
She stole Ezra from Nicole.<eos> They were hooking up while she was rotting away...<eos> That's enough, Addison.<eos> It's just my opinion.<eos> - Lesbo.
- Hey, mom.<eos> Uh, Mona, I didn't know you would be coming tonight.<eos> Neither did I.<eos> Well, we thought it was a good opportunity for Mona to come here and reconnect with everyone.<eos> Drinks?
Mona.<eos> Deja vu, bitch.<eos> We didn't think you'd wake up so soon, Spencer.<eos> Mary?<eos> Sweet dreams.
Don't worry about it.<eos> I'll go figure it out.<eos> Bye.<eos> That was the state police.<eos> Still no leads on Mary.
She's gonna swing by the apartment and get you something to wear.<eos> My mom's sleeping over, so we're gonna stay with you, okay?<eos> Aria.<eos> Ezra.<eos> Still no word?
Charlotte Drake, I will be calling you.<eos> And I'm not going to wait three days.<eos> I'll ring you tomorrow.<eos> Enchante, mademoiselle.<eos> Au revoir.
- I'm not fat.<eos> - I still, to this day, don't know exactly what it was that Duckman did for the general.<eos> It's a mixture of cross-pollinational collation...<eos> Admiral Simon Ball was Glen's public affairs officer.<eos> - Cooperational, cooperative...
I think we're doing a pretty good job here, sir.<eos> You build infrastructure.<eos> Roads, schools, stuff like that.<eos> What kind of presence does the Taliban have here?<eos> - Who?
My father bought it.<eos> What do you got?<eos> Sir.<eos> Where you boys headed?<eos> Back to our patrol base, sir.
I'd go so far as to say you boys are the only thing that counts.<eos> If it doesn't happen here, it doesn't happen. End of story.<eos> - Yes, son?<eos> - If what doesn't happen, sir?<eos> It, son.
Because, as Sergeant Ortega here has so rightly pointed out, your mission is to protect the people, not kill them.<eos> We can't help them and kill them at the same time.<eos> It just ain't humanly possible.<eos> Do you understand me?<eos> No, not really, sir. No.
Let me tell you what I want you to do, Tom Howard.<eos> I want you to go sit your ass down wherever the fuck your ass was officially designated to sit, and I want you to tell Badi to bring his ass back over here!<eos> How's that sound, Tom Howard?<eos> I'm sorry, sir.<eos> Ma'am.
Boss and Mrs. Boss, down there.<eos> - You, drink!<eos> - No, no.<eos> - You, drink!<eos> - Down the hatch.
You are fighting 1,000 separate battles with locals whose principal ideological position would seem to be simply that they don't want foreign soldiers in their village.<eos> And that, General, you must know, is a war you will never win.<eos> with all due respect, ma'am... I must beg to differ.<eos> I firmly believe, having traveled to all corners of the country, having spoken with many people from many walks of life... that what these people want is the very same thing that you and I want.<eos> Freedom, security, stability, jobs.
Sorry to wake you.<eos> We have a problem.<eos> That Rolling Stone article came out, and it's not good.<eos> Sir, it says we're shit-talking our president.<eos> And our vice president.
- Do you really have to?<eos> It's just two days.<eos> She must be pretty, you know... In the bedroom.<eos> Come on.<eos> Hi, Stu.
I'm gonna kill Abigail.<eos> That's her son, Ziggy, right there, who's playing with Chloe and the boys.<eos> Can you believe that they're in first grade?<eos> I know. Take a lot of pictures.<eos> - Hi, Maddie.
Career-wise.<eos> Okay, well, let's just finish that analogy.<eos> Let's not leave Bonnie out of this.<eos> Her little cup just runneth over with happiness, doesn't it?<eos> With no college degree at all.
Yes, finally. I...<eos> I have a charge from your company on my credit card bill, but I didn't order anything from whoever you are...<eos> Northwest Science Supply.<eos> Yeah, Norman Bates.<eos> October 16th.
How old is she?<eos> What?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Y-y-you know I'm... you know I'm... You know I'm just bad at guessing ages.<eos> 40, 50, 60?
Do you know what day today is?<eos> - Tuesday.<eos> - No! It's Saturday.<eos> - Close enough.<eos> - Happy anniversary!
But, hey, why don't you go knock on their doors.<eos> Maybe they'll take you in.<eos> I love you!<eos> - I love you mom.<eos> - Sweet dreams!
I'm trying to sleep and the kid won't stop talking!<eos> - You were talking too!<eos> - To tell you to stop talking!<eos> - Still talking!<eos> - No, no! - Enough!
And that I'm glad you're going with me.<eos> I patched it up for you. So you can sleep better.<eos> Give me a piece of paper, Hugo.<eos> I wanna write a letter too.<eos> To who?
I patched it up for you. So you can sleep better.<eos> Give me a piece of paper, Hugo.<eos> I wanna write a letter too.<eos> To who?<eos> My dad.
God!<eos> Now what?<eos> Hey.<eos> Guys! I was just looking for you.<eos> Coffee?
So, leave her.<eos> Leave her?<eos> And end up like you with nothing?<eos> Look, it's survival of the fittest. Come on, bro, you know the game.<eos> No hard feelings.
It is so nice to meet you.<eos> Thank you. Thank you for this opportunity<eos> I promise that you wont regret it.<eos> I certainly hope not. You come very highly recommended.<eos> By who?
It's good enough for me; It should be good enough for you.<eos> It's gonna be good enough for everyone else, too.<eos> What's our mantra?<eos> Every day we're gonna be...<eos> - Brave.
Yeah.<eos> I think it's a good idea.<eos> This is gonna be a really good year for us, Sparkles.<eos> Oops.<eos> Wow.
- What?<eos> Chloe.<eos> Abby, come on.<eos> This is so Renata.<eos> On the very first day of school?
- No, I'm never out of my mind.<eos> I don't get to be crazy, Madeline.<eos> I'm stable, I'm grounded.<eos> Good ol' steady Eddie, that's me.<eos> Wow.
I was in that bar, and I distinctly saw Madeline... glance at a steak knife.<eos> What a cunt.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Why don't you get fucked?<eos> Wow.
There's a big difference.<eos> Did you hear me?<eos> They arrived just after you left.<eos> Double the price, I think, for nighttime deliveries.<eos> Wow.
They're just for in case, you know, the day comes.<eos> Not that it's coming any time soon, but I just have them.<eos> You are 16 years old.<eos> Where did you get them?<eos> - From a doctor.
It's not real!<eos> It's not...<eos> All right.<eos> You heard a voice coming through the radio, and now you're convinced that it's the voice of...<eos> Stiles.
Stiles.<eos> Your son.<eos> Uh-huh. And maybe it's just a random signal cross?<eos> Peter gave us the keys to the Jeep and it started right up.<eos> Claudia's Jeep.
At least as much as I can remember.<eos> We always served this when we had friends to visit.<eos> We didn't come to visit.<eos> We're looking for someone.<eos> A friend of ours.
Maybe you've seen him.<eos> His name is Stiles?<eos> It's been a while since anyone came through Canaan.<eos> How long?<eos> Since April 8th, 1987?
Come here for a sec.<eos> Look at the date.<eos> Uh, Caleb?<eos> Do you know what year you were born?<eos> 1976.
It's like the Ghost Riders are unstoppable.<eos> They are unstoppable.<eos> They've been riding the storm and taking souls since long before I was born.<eos> Yeah, we won't survive them.<eos> Not without your help.
What makes you think this is gonna work?<eos> You took Josh's power.<eos> You can do it.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Hey, what the hell?
I can't see a thing.<eos> It's got to be down here somewhere.<eos> Found it!<eos> It's remarkably similar.<eos> To what?
It's got to be down here somewhere.<eos> Found it!<eos> It's remarkably similar.<eos> To what?<eos> To the Einstein-Rosen bridge.
Desperate to get inside and save everyone, and hoping to find a way to stop this army of the dead.<eos> We all want the same thing.<eos> He has a point.<eos> If he doesn't kill anyone.<eos> Else.
I thought I saw him.<eos> It's like something opened right there in the middle of the room.<eos> Just for a moment.<eos> And then it was gone.<eos> A rift.
Think it'll hold them off?<eos> - Probably not. - Definitely not.<eos> You guys aren't hoping I'm gonna be the optimist, are you?<eos> So, how cold does this thing get?<eos> LYDIA: Cold enough for a Hellhound.
I feel completely hopeless.<eos> Just, please, let me out.<eos> I can't.<eos> - Where does this take us?<eos> - The hospital. Hospital?
Why?<eos> What's he gonna do?<eos> - He's gonna remember.<eos> - Remember what?<eos> Stiles.
It's too dangerous.<eos> We're not going to save anyone by freezing you guys to death.<eos> But it was working, wasn't it?<eos> There was a light and a strange noise.<eos> No Stiles.
It means... It's working.<eos> This looks fresh.<eos> It's from Stiles' Jeep.<eos> It must have just left.<eos> Without his keys?
You'll make a fine Ghost Rider, Scott.<eos> And I'll have a true Alpha by my side.<eos> Parrish!<eos> Stop!<eos> And then a Banshee, a were-coyote...
And I'll have a true Alpha by my side.<eos> Parrish!<eos> Stop!<eos> And then a Banshee, a were-coyote...<eos> - A Stiles.
No, you were gone for three months.<eos> I was... What?<eos> Okay, if they don't let me graduate, I swear to God...<eos> - What are you looking for?<eos> - Ah! This.
I was... What?<eos> Okay, if they don't let me graduate, I swear to God...<eos> - What are you looking for?<eos> - Ah! This.<eos> And him.
And that's with good behavior.<eos> Dao says his supervisor can get you a deal for three to five years.<eos> And I love Dao for saying that, but...<eos> You gave him the head of the Kensington Firm.<eos> The former head.
You're giving me a death sentence.<eos> We're giving you the opportunity to live exactly as you did before.<eos> Setting up cons, pulling jobs, but looping me in so that I can collect evidence, make arrests.<eos> Once word spreads that I'm setting people up<eos> - for the feds...
- Tommy.<eos> Well... the Kincaids... They don't need it anymore, right?<eos> Because they're dead.<eos> Not dead... murdered.<eos> Probably for the money.
Please hold.<eos> I'm with the Department of Water and... Power.<eos> All clear.<eos> We will start with you facedown.<eos> Face... facedown.
Happy endings all around, then?<eos> I'll let you know.<eos> I've got the case.<eos> You in the car?<eos> Not quite yet.
I didn't know you had, company.<eos> You can go away now.<eos> Um... sorry.<eos> I didn't see anything.<eos> Nothing.
And why would we ever do that?<eos> Because you need clients and cash.<eos> Which I can supply...<eos> Half a million dollars...<eos> Real, not counterfeit.
And why don't we like kenji?<eos> Our informant tells us that mr. Yoshida. Is his source for high-end contraband.<eos> Meaning?<eos> It could be anything...<eos> Fine cigars, pharmaceuticals...
You can start with my three missing lieutenants.<eos> If I were to write a list of everyone who wants me dead, We'll be here all day.<eos> You will be here all day.<eos> We'll get you a new room, But you're not going anywhere until we catch the shooter.<eos> So, no room service, no phone calls, no internet,
Sophie tells me we may need. To get you your own desk at the office.<eos> Nice work with the dogs today.<eos> Thank you.<eos> And I don't like to brag, But I also set a mean table, as well.<eos> Four place settings?
I think that... What I think doesn't matter.<eos> You boys are pros.<eos> You don't need the fbi. Giving you directives or resources or backup.<eos> Well...<eos> Not necessarily...
You can tell me. My whole life is keeping secrets.<eos> Most days, I just want to get back to my six-seater in osaka.<eos> Why is that?<eos> Because this... This all belonged to other people.<eos> Who?
For a while.<eos> I'll need a new passport, new social.<eos> An entirely new you.<eos> Is that something that... someone in your line of work can do?<eos> For you?
I don't want to talk about Tommy.<eos> I want to talk about you and me.<eos> - What the hell?<eos> - My God.<eos> At ease, children.
I thought you said you didn't know who hired you.<eos> I don't.<eos> But he knows how he was hired, and hopefully, the two of you are good enough at your job that you can do something useful with that information.<eos> Do you know anything about blockchain databases?<eos> The Ethereum Network?
Tommy could be anywhere.<eos> We could get the police involved.<eos> He does have an army of drug dealers after him.<eos> Who would we call?<eos> Rene?
We have a walk-in.<eos> So, how can we help you, Mr...?<eos> Tasker.<eos> I'm looking for someone.<eos> A thief.
Yeah, but I have to do something.<eos> I wouldn't even have the money if it wasn't for her.<eos> Guys, this was just delivered.<eos> It's for Sophie.<eos> Me?
Which is why it just might work.<eos> I'm sorry you didn't like them.<eos> He had such a terrible time trying to decide.<eos> He even had to call a friend.<eos> A friend?
Go play with your friends.<eos> Go on.<eos> What is that?<eos> Fugu.<eos> Pufferfish.
Around as we can go.<eos> Through.<eos> What is this place?<eos> A prison. Prison of the Abject.<eos> Most secure.
That's all I want, I just... I just really want to go home.<eos> The Wizard is great and powerful.<eos> He can get you home.<eos> Poppy pollen.<eos> Opium.
Hey, you're hurt.<eos> Prison... Prison of Abject.<eos> I woke with the strangest taste in my mouth.<eos> Do you know who I am?<eos> Witch!
Why did you come for me?<eos> I didn't!<eos> Are you one of Glinda's girls?<eos> Did she send you to kill me?<eos> Who? Who...
I will protect you because I am the Great and Powerful<eos> Wizard of Oz!<eos> Dorothy. We should go.<eos> Where does the road lead?<eos> To Emerald City.
Wizard of Oz!<eos> Dorothy. We should go.<eos> Where does the road lead?<eos> To Emerald City.<eos> To the Wizard of Oz.
- Yeah.<eos> - What?<eos> You.<eos> How long have you been saving that?<eos> A few miles.
Put pressure, okay?<eos> We're gonna get you help.<eos> You're just a little septic, but I've already stopped the bleeding, so you're fine.<eos> All you need is a shot of penicillin... it's the most common drug in the world.<eos> My world.
My world.<eos> Hi, sir, my friend is dying, and I need some medicine.<eos> Do you know where I can find any?<eos> Medicine, uh... doctor, pharmacy.<eos> For him.
Numbers and patterns and theorems... they're beautiful.<eos> As beautiful as magic.<eos> Would you like to join me for the funeral?<eos> I hear it's quite a show.<eos> Out of my way.
Because the Wizard wants you dead.<eos> - How did they get up there?<eos> - I'm told they climbed.<eos> 200 feet?<eos> Without ropes?
- No.<eos> They're possessed by magic.<eos> What're they doing now?<eos> It's a ritual.<eos> For what?
They're possessed by magic.<eos> What're they doing now?<eos> It's a ritual.<eos> For what?<eos> Suicide.
If I may?<eos> Field patterns of a remote region in the West.<eos> They bear similarity to these engravings made before The Beast appeared in 1378.<eos> What form did it take back then?<eos> Fire.
I'll give it a try.<eos> Mom.<eos> Do all the girls take poppies?<eos> Most of take them every once in a while.<eos> Just for fun.
This is how you were born.<eos> If I may?<eos> Just tell me Elizabeth was wrong.<eos> She was.<eos> But not about the timing.
And that is why you want it opened.<eos> I'm saying this for your benefit and for the benefit of Oz.<eos> I will tell no one.<eos> Not even Clinda.<eos> Mistress!
- Couldn't determine the weather, could you?<eos> I'll go myself.<eos> Well, I should at least be by your side.<eos> You still need counsel. Yes...<eos> Just not yours.
It's all right, child.<eos> We only want to help you.<eos> You're alone in this world, yes?<eos> Afraid.<eos> Without options.
We only want to help you.<eos> You're alone in this world, yes?<eos> Afraid.<eos> Without options.<eos> Without purpose.
You ready to work?<eos> I don't want to forget.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> Well, what do you want?<eos> Your magic.
The Beast comes because it must.<eos> To cleanse and purify.<eos> This is how it's been forever.<eos> Where was your science for my wife?<eos> And this village?
The Princess owns you.<eos> - You ready to work?<eos> - I don't want to forget.<eos> - Well, what do you want?<eos> - Your magic.
If those men find you, they will finish the job for sure.<eos> Eamonn! Oh, I need to get you help.<eos> Stay here.<eos> That is an order.<eos> Help!
I trust you will be fair.<eos> Fair with you.<eos> Yes. Not so much with her.<eos> You said you would free my wife.<eos> Nahara.
Fair with you.<eos> Yes. Not so much with her.<eos> You said you would free my wife.<eos> Nahara.<eos> From the Prison of the Abject.
She was my mother!<eos> She should have taught you how to tell the truth!<eos> I'm not lying! I'm not lying!<eos> I don't know her!<eos> Your own mother?
Something in you that's broken and couldn't ever be fixed.<eos> Go to hell.<eos> How did you get those?<eos> Those were hers.<eos> My sister's.
You hadn't seen her in years?<eos> Why?<eos> Did the girl tell you differently?<eos> The girl said all kinds of things.<eos> Mistress!
That's where I stabbed you before you went down.<eos> I've done some bad things and now I have to answer for them.<eos> I don't want to hurt you too.<eos> I need you to promise me:<eos> no magic.
I've done some bad things and now I have to answer for them.<eos> I don't want to hurt you too.<eos> I need you to promise me:<eos> no magic.<eos> No magic.
Because you are more valuable as my ally.<eos> Perhaps the same is true for Dorothy.<eos> The mother witch lives!<eos> And is breeding witches.<eos> For glinda!
A demonstration.<eos> Make these guns!<eos> We take them to war.<eos> A war on magic!<eos> For the very soul of oz!
She loves me just as much, and I love her.<eos> Do you have a mother?<eos> You'll find her someday.<eos> But until then, you're not alone.<eos> Sweet dreams.
There's only one person I fight for since the moment we met.<eos> And you for me.<eos> Remember?<eos> Who made it out?<eos> None.
It's mine.<eos> That's not true.<eos> I took it from the place where I grew up.<eos> The crest is King Pastoria's... handed down to his daughter at birth.<eos> His daughter?
I took it from the place where I grew up.<eos> The crest is King Pastoria's... handed down to his daughter at birth.<eos> His daughter?<eos> The Princess.<eos> Ozma.
After retrieving the weapons from ev, we'll march north to glinda and bury her and her pathetic witchlings.<eos> Then we'll host a celebration to quell any doubts that science triumphs over magic.<eos> You've been keeping secrets.<eos> I've been keeping a dagger.<eos> For protection.
- The queen often enjoys a bath after her meals.<eos> Of course, sir.<eos> I do apologize.<eos> Will the queen be joining me?<eos> Not in the bath, sir.
Of course, sir.<eos> I do apologize.<eos> Will the queen be joining me?<eos> Not in the bath, sir.<eos> No, for breakfast.
She said no to me.<eos> So what?<eos> You can't just enjoy people when it suits you, use them up and toss them aside.<eos> People serve a purpose.<eos> For business and for pleasure. No.
I lifted my spell.<eos> Your spell was worthless.<eos> It's hers that I can't break.<eos> I've tried.<eos> For you, for us, and I...
Just rip it...<eos> Rip it out of me, please.<eos> You must do that.<eos> Take my life.<eos> Hers.
- Oh, grow up.<eos> Two witches aren't just going to walk into Emerald City and unseat The Wizard alone.<eos> Fine.<eos> What else do we need?<eos> Supporters.
You will never have your revenge.<eos> I finally have what I care about most.<eos> Emerald City, the throne, that's what you want.<eos> That's why I gave you my sister's powers!<eos> Not for your own pettdulgces.
Her words were false.<eos> I want Nahara free too.<eos> And I have the power to do it.<eos> What do you want from her?<eos> The Stone Giants.
I want Nahara free too.<eos> And I have the power to do it.<eos> What do you want from her?<eos> The Stone Giants.<eos> The Eternal Warriors.
To stop Glinda permanently.<eos> It took magic to raise them, and The Wizard doesn't have any.<eos> But Nahara does, doesn't she?<eos> I want her to raise the Giants again.<eos> For the Wizard?
It took magic to raise them, and The Wizard doesn't have any.<eos> But Nahara does, doesn't she?<eos> I want her to raise the Giants again.<eos> For the Wizard?<eos> For me.
Free magic?<eos> Yes.<eos> Free magic.<eos> This is why you had me drink East's spells.<eos> Not for me.
In certain circles, I was known as the Wicked Witch of the West.<eos> Yeah, I heard that.<eos> As you once stood united with King Pastoria, you now stand with his child, the one true heir to the throne, Ozma.<eos> Follow us to Emerald City to end the one who imprisoned you:<eos> the horrible Wizard of Oz!
None here will be intimidated by The Wizard's whore.<eos> - I'm nobody's whore.<eos> - You're worse.<eos> You're a traitor, and you will speak no more.<eos> Mistress!
Then you get nothing.<eos> Why don't you try and convince them?<eos> Soldiers of Ev, we can fight together or we can die apart.<eos> And the first death will be the most tragic and unnecessary death of your Queen if you don't put down your weapons.<eos> Madame Queen?
- To cut down the wizard.<eos> Dorothy, okay?<eos> I want nahara free.<eos> - What do you want from her?<eos> - The stone giants.
The drone shows an army approaching.<eos> Who are they?<eos> Still unknown to us.<eos> Show me.<eos> Track closer.
We have a war to win!<eos> It was you.<eos> You didn't think it was you, did you?<eos> How?<eos> Nahara.
I have a daughter of your age.<eos> When I looked down at you... I saw her looking back.<eos> I saw myself in her eyes.<eos> A murderer.<eos> A coward.
My tongue is right.<eos> And I will not let another one of our kind die.<eos> Take my hands.<eos> Let us become what we were meant to be.<eos> To each other, to oz.
And the truth will do us both some good here.<eos> Karen Chapman was hurt...<eos> Because I wanted her dead, because I sent my men to kill her in Kansas.<eos> I thought she was gonna return to oz.<eos> For Jane.
Karen Chapman was hurt...<eos> Because I wanted her dead, because I sent my men to kill her in Kansas.<eos> I thought she was gonna return to oz.<eos> For Jane.<eos> For me!
I'll do it until the day I die.<eos> No!<eos> Mom, no!<eos> Where ya headed?<eos> Hospital.
My mother.<eos> Where is she?<eos> Tell me.<eos> She's a prisoner...<eos> Of the beast forever.
Get to the guns!<eos> Get the shots!<eos> Looks like the barricade held, sir.<eos> Your orders?<eos> Open fire.
And in four months.. in Delhi.<eos> But, Sir, to fight our battle, we'll need guns, explosives, tanks, transport. And for those, money.<eos> We will arrange for the money.<eos> Pardon me sir, but from where?<eos> Bombay.
I don't want to die before becoming Mrs. Billimoria.<eos> You are Julia.<eos> Miss Julia.<eos> My Julia.<eos> Lights!
"He has become the King's comrade, and hence shows off arrogantly."<eos> "What other claim to respect does 'Ghalib' have in the city?"<eos> Well said!<eos> Thank you, Mr. Billimoria..<eos> Rusi.
Ms. Julia, you're a hero in reel life.<eos> But who is your hero in real life?<eos> Who is that lucky man?<eos> The nation wants to know.<eos> Rusi.
Sir!<eos> I'm no less than Julia, she's my junior.<eos> I don't care"<eos> I can't walk, I want a donkey right now!<eos> Of course, Queen Victoria.
Including..<eos> That's OK.<eos> Keep moving.<eos> Including?<eos> Rusi!
Something that.. You have never told anyone else.<eos> I'm afraid.<eos> Afraid?<eos> Being a soldier?<eos> Of what?
I'm afraid.<eos> Afraid?<eos> Being a soldier?<eos> Of what?<eos> Death?
Afraid?<eos> Being a soldier?<eos> Of what?<eos> Death?<eos> No, of love.
- Yes"<eos> Hiro..<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I thought we were friends.<eos> Farewell!
- Mama.<eos> My Mama.<eos> He got himself into a tangle the gentleman, the good man<eos> He got himself into a tangle the gentleman, the good man<eos> From the right and the left
Listen, stay away from her.<eos> If her man finds out, he'll bury you both alive.<eos> Zulfi, my pistol"<eos> - To hell with it!<eos> Especially for you!
Sergeant Gurung.<eos> Sergeant Sarabjit Singh.<eos> Mr. Billimoria, where should we dispatch the body to?<eos> Where it belongs!<eos> In the jungle, with the animals.
Dump the body in the jungle.<eos> He was an INA spy.<eos> Which of you knew that?<eos> Are there others like him.. Amongst you?<eos> Or amongst us?
This is love, this is love" This is love, this is love"<eos> Lost in his own self, this Sufi, an enigma<eos> Tabrezi, when awake; Rum] when he speaks<eos> This is love, this is love"<eos> To the bomb shelter!
- Oh, my God. He's got David.<eos> - Who's David?<eos> One of you is gonna die.<eos> You choose, thief.<eos> Thief?
12.6 million.<eos> Truck had just left Santa Anita with the cash take from the Breeders' Cup.<eos> You want me to go out there and ask some questions?<eos> No, I want you to go on the inside.<eos> No shit?
Did I ask you about your failing marriage?<eos> No.<eos> Just shut up and suit up, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> No way.
We've just the piece for you.<eos> Piet Mondrian's Composition No. 7, 1941.<eos> 20x26 inches.<eos> And if you pay in cash, it's 14.<eos> Million.
Why are you in front of my partner's house?<eos> Oh, just giving my condolences.<eos> - You knew TJ?<eos> - Yup.<eos> The Academy.
LA-15-7-MARY-3 and 4, we are in pursuit of red Ferrari.<eos> Code three!<eos> I was trying to give you a goddamn compliment!<eos> This is 7-MARY-4, we need backup.<eos> All units.
Who all knew about TJ and Barton?<eos> Listen, man, I didn't know about that shit until just now and we were partners eight years.<eos> The guy pointing the gun at Barton damn well knew.<eos> - Was he friends with an "LT"?<eos> - Which one?
Yeah.<eos> Watch this. I'm gonna make him give up his whole crew.<eos> We heard this was your spot.<eos> Man, what is that?<eos> Four, four-fifty?
This is 7-MARY-3 and 4.<eos> We're southbound on Lincoln Boulevard and Rose.<eos> In pursuit of red Ducati Hypermotard.<eos> Fuck that.<eos> Out of the way!
Get out of the way.<eos> Ponch, what's your 20?<eos> I'm somewhere in the parking structure.<eos> Fuck, shit.<eos> Over and out!
You saved my life?<eos> I gave you CPR and I breathed life back into you.<eos> So, when I went out cold, you ran in and tried to kiss me?<eos> And you said it was CPR?<eos> Not quite! Um...
You got hit by a truck.<eos> Yeah, but my titanium humerus took most of the hit.<eos> It was only a five.<eos> Five out of what?<eos> Out of ten.
I actually figured out why you're so hell-bent on keeping her.<eos> Yeah?<eos> She's the only thing left of your glory days. You know?<eos> Like, the money's gone. Fans are gone.<eos> Now, the house.
Isn't that what you call it over here?<eos> You don't seem surprised.<eos> No.<eos> But I hoped it wasn't.<eos> For Peter's sake.
I don't know.<eos> But, er... fortunately, you'll be working closely with Herr Dr Huth, so his thoughts will not be a mystery, if you get my meaning.<eos> What did they want?<eos> I've been reassigned.<eos> Genealogy.
I'm not sure General Kellermann gave me any choice.<eos> That is the problem with having a reputation.<eos> You don't think for a minute it's a black-market murder.<eos> In my experience, the truth doesn't offer itself up just like that.<eos> No loose ends?
Spotter planes will have it easy.<eos> I think that'll be it for the Resistance.<eos> Except maybe in the north, in the unoccupied zone.<eos> Yeah, they say it's bad up there.<eos> Shortages.
Hello?<eos> It's all right.<eos> I'm alone.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Help.
Only a bloody fool tries to jam the sprocket wheel of a Mark IV with a tyre lever.<eos> He went past me without even noticing... and took my arm with him.<eos> You being there wouldn't have made much difference, Superintendent, believe me.<eos> Is it a confession you wanted, or absolution?<eos> Understanding.
And this half-witted army officer, Hesse, watched too?<eos> Yes.<eos> Any chance that he passed him the capsule? No, sir.<eos> So from the moment you arrested Spode, was there even the briefest opportunity for this damned army officer, Hesse, to pass him anything at all?<eos> No chance at all, sir.
If we get this one wrong, Superintendent Archer, you'll find yourself in Dachau.<eos> Do you know what Dachau is?<eos> I've heard the rumours, sir.<eos> They are all true, believe me.<eos> Canonbury 7946.
I'm going to The Two Brewers with Sergeant Woods.<eos> Don't answer the door to anyone.<eos> What is it you want?<eos> No Resistance?<eos> No hope?
Smooth as silk and twice as slippery.<eos> But he sure knows how to throw a party.<eos> Takes me back to my days in high school.<eos> In the Midwest?<eos> Wisconsin.
You know her?<eos> Yeah, I've spent a bit of time in Washington and, er... she's a popular girl.<eos> And you seem popular with her.<eos> Married woman.<eos> Divorcee.
How's your friend Harry Woods?<eos> Useful prop, back when I used to play.<eos> Grumpy.<eos> He's finding it difficult.<eos> Difficult for us all.
I know.<eos> This isn't the way to The Dorchester.<eos> Who said I was still there?<eos> I'm renting now.<eos> My lady.
If you are as clever as I am told... you will have deduced how important this case is to us.<eos> And why would that be?<eos> Spode was an atomic physicist.<eos> It looks like the Resistance killed him because he was continuing his work under the Germans.<eos> But not under the SS.
- Are you all right?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Springer!<eos> Springer!<eos> Aus dem Weg!
Well, at least you weren't rounded up.<eos> I'm American. We're immune.<eos> Maybe you are.<eos> So, where are we going?<eos> Ambassador Kennedy's little place.
Dog-walker's passed by three times in the last hour.<eos> God.<eos> Er, I think that might be down to me.<eos> How long have they been watching you?<eos> Since yesterday.
Doc, could you...?<eos> Wait for the pathologist?<eos> Outside.<eos> Thanks for the tobacco.<eos> Cairn 0235.
We Germans are not barbarians, Mr Woods.<eos> Why should he be manacled?<eos> Barbara?<eos> She's not here.<eos> Cairn 0235.
How did I get here?<eos> You're the only survivor we found.<eos> It was a bloodbath.<eos> What about Douglas Archer?<eos> No sign of him.
Oh, you are so sweet, But tomorrow there's a bunch of us That are all driving to san jose for disney on ice.<eos> Oh, um, well, i-- i just--<eos> Ithought-- well, maybe we could swing by afterwards.<eos> How late will the party be going until?<eos> 3:00.
Please don't "honey" me.<eos> I know she enjoyed her party, But you have to admit her excitement seemed tempered,<eos> And that's because chloe and a couple of other favorite friends weren't there.<eos> Yeah, but to seek medical help?<eos> Medical?
Thank you.<eos> And it's a pretty smooth... six days?<eos> - Yeah? - So...<eos> - Other than our little...<eos> - What?
So, you went to visit Bonnie at her studio?<eos> Wow. No secrets in this town.<eos> I was thinking about doing a sit-up and wanted to get her advice.<eos> Went to talk about the dinner, how to best avoid friction.<eos> Or animosity.
Wow. No secrets in this town.<eos> I was thinking about doing a sit-up and wanted to get her advice.<eos> Went to talk about the dinner, how to best avoid friction.<eos> Or animosity.<eos> - Violence?
I hit him.<eos> I throw things at him.<eos> I'm...<eos> What are you looking for from me, Celeste?<eos> Help.
9:30, Skype, tonight!<eos> - Where the hell is your shirt?<eos> - Tonight!<eos> - And every night!<eos> - And every single night!
These idiots just broke into my room.<eos> Come on, Vision Quest.<eos> Gabriel says you're up.<eos> Let's go to the 7s.<eos> - Shit.
It was the only way to save him.<eos> Anyone would have done it.<eos> You know, I could show you some research that would suggest the opposite.<eos> She's marked already.<eos> On day one.
Where do you think you're going, sir?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Turn around.<eos> Stop!<eos> Evelyn!
This is what becomes of your savior!<eos> With the grace of the Holy Spirit, may the Lord who freed you from sin save you, and raise you up!<eos> Julia...<eos> Don't leave me.<eos> ...from sin!
Thank you so much.<eos> That's terrible.<eos> I tell myself I won't text back immediately when Olly texts me.<eos> And then I text back.<eos> Immediately.
- Lord of the Flies. - Uh-huh. - Macabre.<eos> Black.<eos> Uh, petty theft.<eos> And my sister.<eos> Lord of the Flies?
Is that a new sweater?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Carla irradiated it.<eos> And where'd you get it?<eos> From Rosa.
I'm really good at handstands. Yeah?<eos> What else can you do? Oh, man.<eos> I'm afraid that's pretty much it.<eos> You didn't touch, right? No.<eos> No touching.
Why would you risk your life for a total stranger?<eos> I'm okay.<eos> He's not a stranger, is he?<eos> We're just friends online.<eos> Online...
Stay here.<eos> Wait.<eos> Just try not to breathe.<eos> Ready?<eos> Just till Friday, okay?
No more texts.<eos> No more e-mails.<eos> Olly, this is just too hard.<eos> My mom was right, life was better before.<eos> Better for who?
- You goddamn right.<eos> You better get yourself a queen.<eos> 'Cause you just went and killed one of theirs.<eos> That's one of mine. I killed one of mine.<eos> Not anymore.
Gods are real if you believe in them.<eos> Gods. Uh-huh.<eos> Fuck me.<eos> That's Jesus Christ.<eos> A Jesus Christ. Some Jesus Christ.
You don't sound like one of us. I'm not one of you.<eos> Oh, yes you are.<eos> You're as forgotten, and as unloved and as unremembered as any of us.<eos> I'm doing just fine.<eos> Happy Easter.
No.<eos> No! It's her day. You took it.<eos> You crucified her day.<eos> When they started following you, everybody else got burned. In your name.<eos> Happy fucking Easter.
Who were you, exactly?<eos> I was, uh, Laura Moon.<eos> Um, I'm still Laura Moon.<eos> Laura Moon.<eos> Shadow Moon?
Folks have always been curious about that exact moment of death.<eos> As if the difference between one side of that divide and the other could be quantified.<eos> Some believe that you can develop a last image seen off their retinas. Like a photograph.<eos> Death is usually the last enemy.<eos> Right but not for, uh... not for Jesus Christ.

Good luck.<eos> I was killed... by a god?<eos> Which... fucking... god?<eos> Never saw you look quite so pretty before. Happy Easter, Easter.<eos> Oh. And to you.
Just hope you keep an eye on him.<eos> - Can I help you?<eos> - Yes, I'm late for a meeting.<eos> Is it the yellow or the red line to midtown?<eos> - Yellow.
- Can I help you?<eos> - Yes, I'm late for a meeting.<eos> Is it the yellow or the red line to midtown?<eos> - Yellow.<eos> - Yellow?
What are you doing? What are you doing?<eos> Are you in on it?<eos> - Stop, you're scaring me right now.<eos> - Are you in on it?<eos> - In on what?
Not today. Not me.<eos> You know how they like to do motherfuckers out here, man.<eos> I'm gone.<eos> Come on, brother, this is...<eos> Yo! Yo! Hey!
Seriously, you just threw it out a window?<eos> Just like a dollar. You basically threw a dollar out the window.<eos> Great. That was a dollar you decided to spend on nicotine. Yeah.<eos> Hold on, I gotta call Rod.<eos> Oh, Rod.
Lickin' your balls or somethin'?<eos> Yeah, bye.<eos> You know what I'm sayin', Chris?<eos> Chris.<eos> Chri...
Come here, Chris. Look at me.<eos> I found it.<eos> Where was your mom?<eos> She was coming home and she wasn't home. From work?<eos> Hmm.
I know who you are.<eos> She is lovely, isn't she? Rose?<eos> Yeah, she is.<eos> One of a kind.<eos> Top of the line.
Logan, I hate to tear you away, dear, but the Wincotts were asking about you.<eos> Well, it was nice to meet you, Chris.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Ignorance.
That's Dre.<eos> Dre?<eos> Andre Hayworth.<eos> He used to kick it with Veronica.<eos> Veronica from what?
There's no need to worry.<eos> Let's take a walk.<eos> You have been chosen because of the physical advantages you've enjoyed your entire lifetime.<eos> With your natural gifts and our determination, we could both be part of something greater.<eos> Something perfect.
You arrive in America, land of opportunity, milk and honey, and guess what?<eos> You all get to be slaves.<eos> Split up, sold off and worked to death.<eos> The lucky ones get Sunday off to sleep and fuck and make more slaves, and all for what?<eos> For cotton?
Split up, sold off and worked to death.<eos> The lucky ones get Sunday off to sleep and fuck and make more slaves, and all for what?<eos> For cotton?<eos> Indigo?<eos> For a fucking purple shirt?
Let it all burn!<eos> - Were you shot at?<eos> - No.<eos> If you were, I'd have to call the cops. No.<eos> No. No cops.
Lucy Ricardo.<eos> I'm all sorts, Shadow.<eos> The screen is the altar.<eos> I'm the one they sacrifice to.<eos> Then till now. Golden Age to Golden Age.
Yeah.<eos> Good.<eos> Your move.<eos> ♫ My love made ♫ ♫ The sweetest coffee ♫<eos> ♫ With no sugar at all ♫
- I'm wearing it for the play.<eos> Jake wanted us to dress period.<eos> He's so smart.<eos> - 'Lacey?<eos> ' - Brody.
I really don't know what I'd do without you guys.<eos> Um... I feel like last night.. ...before Cassie got home, there was..<eos> Um... uh, really you felt that way?<eos> I think I know what you were gonna say.<eos> Wow.
That's fantastic.<eos> I think we should go while their jaws are still on the floor.<eos> Yeah.<eos> 'Thank you, Paige.'<eos> Goodbye.
Yeah.<eos> 'Thank you, Paige.'<eos> Goodbye.<eos> - Girl has something.<eos> - No arguments here.
He asked her out for coffee.<eos> So there was this guy.<eos> I know.<eos> Um, uh, I moved to Oregon.<eos> - Oregon?
Oh, my God.<eos> Let's celebrate.<eos> Where are you?<eos> 'I'll send a car.'<eos> Wow!
I won't let you down.<eos> You really want to impress me?<eos> Go sell that fucking house.<eos> Dantzler: So you just came in and he was gone?<eos> No note?
Hey. It's on me.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Watching you and Alvey today.<eos> You guys have been working together for a while, right?<eos> Long time.
Let's work!<eos> I got to go.<eos> You fucking cunt.<eos> Dom!<eos> My office.
And British, which is awesome.<eos> He's a US citizen now.<eos> Yeah, but he's got that accent.<eos> I'm a sucker for a British accent.<eos> Or Australian.
I take mine rare.<eos> Knock off the horns and wipe the ass.<eos> Is that a... baby crying?<eos> Am I wrong?<eos> What the fuck?
Yeah.<eos> You want a ride?<eos> It's early.<eos> Where you going?<eos> Home.
Before you go... Before you go...<eos> Sir?<eos> Sir, can we get two shots of añejo?<eos> No, no, I'm good.<eos> The good shit up top?
It wasn't gossip.<eos> Can we have two more shots?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Come on in.<eos> Drink?
Jay disappeared, and then he came home high.<eos> Ah, fuck, really?<eos> Fucking kid loves chaos.<eos> Yeah, I wonder where he gets that from.<eos> Mnh. You?
Wha...<eos> Travis thinks that he's in love with me.<eos> Everything okay?<eos> My parents want me to think about moving home.<eos> To London?
China's going to change you, I can already tell that.<eos> I think we should take the summer.<eos> See what happens.<eos> - You should come with me.<eos> - To China?
See what happens.<eos> - You should come with me.<eos> - To China?<eos> We'll have an adventure, you and me.<eos> Help!
- To China?<eos> We'll have an adventure, you and me.<eos> Help!<eos> Someone! Please!<eos> Help!
- Yeah? Now we're even.<eos> Oh, the lines are so cool!<eos> J and K are going to flip.<eos> About us staying or, uh, this?<eos> Both.
No.<eos> We gotta go home.<eos> So he O.D.'d?<eos> He took a bunch of drugs.<eos> Pain pills, sleeping pills, meds for anxiety.
- I try.<eos> He's an amazing cook.<eos> And he was a medic in the army in Afghanistan for three years.<eos> A medic?<eos> No kidding.
Can I give you a description... of Billy?<eos> That way if he does... come in, you can keep an eye out for him.<eos> Of course.<eos> Let's go to my office.<eos> Hey, so, just curious...
At first I thought I wasn't supposed to meet you... or feel anything.<eos> But maybe I was wrong.<eos> Um, hi. Is this the Phillips residence?<eos> Connor... Did you know Connor Phillips?<eos> Pat Phillips?
I got a place.<eos> I don't know how much cash I can get.<eos> They have a safe, but... as far as I know, it's collecting dust.<eos> I'm surprised you didn't just run.<eos> Oh, without Eddie?
If you'll excuse me, I need to relax.<eos> I also wanted to see you.<eos> Really?<eos> Did you ever stop to think about what happened to Charlie could have happened to me?<eos> Every second, everyday.
What is Bullwinkle?<eos> You didn't have Rocky and Bullwinkle...<eos> - No.<eos> - ... the cartoon in Slo...<eos> - Slovenia.
You didn't have Rocky and Bullwinkle...<eos> - No.<eos> - ... the cartoon in Slo...<eos> - Slovenia.<eos> - Slovenia.
You put it in the safe with the rublies?<eos> No. After they finish the paperwork, I get a check and deposit it in the bank.<eos> Okay, so for my cut...<eos> And then you get your cut.<eos> Worth every penny.
- to have... - Let me stop you there.<eos> I know what you're doing... trying to tug at my heartstrings, using your grandchildren as props.<eos> But it would really be best for all concerned if you just fucked off.<eos> Before I go, I want you to think about two people.<eos> Two people.
Stop it.<eos> All right, let's do it again.<eos> I think you should scream a little louder.<eos> You know, a guy gets shot, all right?<eos> Uh, all right, from the pull.
You never drop the con.<eos> She's a pro.<eos> Oh. By the way, what's the capital of Slovenia?<eos> Time's up.<eos> Shit.
I'm just going into the city tonight.<eos> A few months back, if I'd had the combo to that safe, I'd already be long over the horizon.<eos> I say that, but...<eos> Grandma and Grandpa have one dead daughter and... another that's dead to them.<eos> No offense.
And I want to hear book reports, essays.<eos> So, if you want to put the boxes just down, and I'll put 'em in.<eos> I'll just have you photograph me putting 'em in here.<eos> Oh, shit. I just took a photo.<eos> Of nothing.
I jumped on it.<eos> I should have got out.<eos> That's what I regret.<eos> Far as anything else, I miss the travels and the people.<eos> Behind the scenes, the crew.
Like, have my own site and pay girls to do stuff.<eos> Or men.<eos> So that I don't have to, like--<eos> I can be, like, a director basically, you know? That'd be cool.<eos> Back up this way now.
Hannah Baker.<eos> That's right.<eos> Don't adjust your... whatever device you're hearing this on.<eos> It's me, live and in stereo.<eos> No return engagements, no encore, and this time, absolutely no requests.
Get a snack.<eos> Settle in.<eos> Because I'm about to tell you the story of my life.<eos> - She was so pretty.<eos> - Totally.
Hannah Baker.<eos> Holy shit.<eos> Don't adjust your... whatever device you're hearing this on.<eos> It's me, live and in stereo.<eos> No return engagements, no encore, and this time, absolutely no requests.
It's not a party without us.<eos> We'll take our chances.<eos> Go dry off.<eos> Your loss, milady.<eos> Idiots.
Jensen!<eos> Clay Jensen!<eos> There you go.<eos> Move your feet!<eos> Helmet!
Uh, yeah. Okay.<eos> You always stand and fidget.<eos> It makes me anxious.<eos> Run it again!<eos> Tootsie Roll?
Last chance.<eos> Yes, Sherri.<eos> Thank you.<eos> And who else?<eos> You in the back?
No matter what, I'm here, okay?<eos> Zach, you're in.<eos> All right, let's run it again!<eos> - Keep up the pace. - Go, go!<eos> Okay. Enough with the small talk.
No, but Jessica's a bit freaked because she's his cheer escort to the assembly, and she missed the morning run-through looking for him.<eos> This is her first event with the squad, and her round-offs are a bit shaky, so...<eos> - Well, that's worrisome.<eos> Yeah. - Right. Why were you looking for him?<eos> No reason.
No, Clay, she liked you so much.<eos> Shoot. German. I can't be late.<eos> Uh...<eos> We should get coffee or something sometime.<eos> Monet's?
Yeah, sure.<eos> Be great.<eos> I met Jessica a couple of weeks into sophomore year.<eos> Apparently, we needed to be counseled.<eos> - Mrs. Antilly? - Yeah.
And how will that help us, like, directionally?<eos> Well, the point is, you won't be strangers.<eos> Starting at a new school can feel overwhelming.<eos> I just want you to have an ally.<eos> Two allies.
That's all.<eos> Mrs. Antilly, I'm sure Hillary is awesome, but...<eos> If we're gonna be great friends, you should know my name is Hannah.<eos> - What did I call you?<eos> - Hillary.
Why?<eos> What for?<eos> Surprisingly, they don't send a complete explanation.<eos> They send a summons.<eos> Attendance.
So, I guess this has to do with your attendance.<eos> What is it?<eos> Daily report.<eos> You're on attendance alert starting this week.<eos> Attendance alerts?
We fully support your conclusions.<eos> Let's discuss this in our office this afternoon.<eos> Wait, our office?<eos> My God.<eos> Monet's.
I mean, I've been losing sleep.<eos> I had Hannah in my class two years in a row.<eos> How many students do you have, Pam?<eos> - That's not the point.<eos> - Over 200.
Zach and Marcus really wanted to give me a ride just now at school.<eos> So?<eos> So... that's never happened before.<eos> They even invited me to hang at Bryce's.<eos> At Bryce's?
He's fucking pissed that he missed the assembly.<eos> He's in the pool house.<eos> Stoned off his gourd, by the way.<eos> He's been here all day?<eos> Yeah, since last night.
I'm sorry to bother you again.<eos> You've done so much for us already, but, well, we found something inside one of the books in Hannah's locker, and we... we don't know what it is, so I was hoping that maybe you could tell us.<eos> Sure, Mrs. Baker, I can be right over.<eos> Yeah, no problem. Yes.<eos> All right, bye.
Thank you, Theresa.<eos> Courtney Crimsen.<eos> What a pretty name.<eos> And what a pretty girl.<eos> With her perfect family.
Um... I should go.<eos> I have to stop by the florist on the way to school, for Hannah's memorial.<eos> Oh, hey, don't forget dinner tonight with the Simonsons.<eos> Bring a friend from school.<eos> - Oh, maybe Marcus.
I will snap your arm in two.<eos> Let me deal with it.<eos> Okay?<eos> Quietly.<eos> No snapping of arms.
I don't care. Don't put it in my face.<eos> Hannah.<eos> You look good.<eos> Who'd you come here with?<eos> Oh, just Courtney.
And stick to the speed limit, kid.<eos> 'Cause next time, I'll ticket you.<eos> Seat belt.<eos> Night, Dad.<eos> No shit.
You got that?<eos> We're fucking bulletproof.<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> What you listening to?<eos> Nothing.
I mean... that damn book is hard.<eos> Like, the sentences are so long, then it's, like, in Spanish...<eos> We only have 20 minutes before the first bell rings.<eos> We could also work on it after school.<eos> Maybe at Monet's?
Did you? Yep.<eos> Well, uh, you know my motto:<eos> no cheerleader left behind.<eos> You get any good matches?<eos> Not one.
no cheerleader left behind.<eos> You get any good matches?<eos> Not one.<eos> - I got Bryce Walker.<eos> - Holy shit, really?
So, this site says that one of John Grady Cole's central flaws is... his tendency to see the world in black and white, good and evil...<eos> Sheri.<eos> Do you remember Dollar Valentines last year?<eos> What?<eos> Dollar Valen...
These are the stupidest, most embarrassing things that I check every day, no matter what.<eos> Sometimes the silly things can mean more than anyone knows.<eos> Get a good one?<eos> Nothing earthshaking.<eos> You?
Thanks for the insight, genius.<eos> I was... I was trying to be nice.<eos> Well, you failed.<eos> Well, fuck you.<eos> Dude, seriously.
Come on, you don't want to miss your boyfriend's big game.<eos> And... we're having fun up there.<eos> Maybe you don't know what it's like to need a lifeline, Zach.<eos> The day after you insulted me in the cafeteria, my compliment bag was empty.<eos> Not even a cute bunny.
And you never know how what you do will affect someone else.<eos> Hey, Bryce, what's up?<eos> Hey, Jensen.<eos> And if that goes for me, it must go for everyone.<eos> Even cheerleaders.
Courtney and Clay, these are our new foreign exchange students joining us this semester.<eos> This is Jhene, Fynn, Mahla and Deep.<eos> Uh, Courtney and Clay will be helping you out.<eos> They are on the Honor Board and they'll be giving you the tour.<eos> The insider's tour!
What is it that you want to do?<eos> I should get to class.<eos> It all started because I was feeling lost.<eos> I needed direction.<eos> Any direction.
Of course.<eos> And if you don't have the money and don't really have the grades, a lot of the decision gets made for you.<eos> What future are you peddling?<eos> I'll let you take the first guess.<eos> Hoarder?
What future are you peddling?<eos> I'll let you take the first guess.<eos> Hoarder?<eos> Close.<eos> Librarian.
You okay?<eos> I was just thinking it's a bad sign that we're... running out of "Buy One, Get One Free" stickers.<eos> We can look at it as a bad sign or we can consider it the world telling us we can never discount our way to Walplex prices.<eos> I've got more stickers back here somewhere.<eos> Oh, Olivia.
-You wouldn't have died.<eos> You'd break a bunch of shit.<eos> I never thought about it.<eos> Dying.<eos> Until this year.
Once.<eos> What was that like?<eos> Quiet.<eos> Not silent or anything, just... no excitement.<eos> No big noise.
I don't think there's any... room. Whoa.<eos> Are you guys playing?<eos> Uh, no.<eos> So you guys just like to watch?<eos> Yeah, only from an anthropological point of view.
But for now, Justin, you'd been with the same girl all night.<eos> But I'm not gonna call her out by name. Even though, if you were at that party, you already know.<eos> JUSTIN: You're so hot.<eos> I can't keep my eyes off of you!<eos> JESSICA: Or your hands.
Since my party, right?<eos> Really?<eos> I guess I don't even remember.<eos> Yeah, I'm pretty sure.<eos> Since the party.
Get some sleep, all right?<eos> I will see you... tomorrow.<eos> You don't have to go out the window.<eos> Sweet dreams, Jess.<eos> Only sweet dreams.
I just have a couple questions.<eos> All right, let's go.<eos> - See you.<eos> - See you.<eos> Justy!
I just needed to be alone.<eos> This was starting to be more than I could live with.<eos> Wait.<eos> What about drama?<eos> No more drama.
Well, that's cold thinking.<eos> We all want a solution that's fair to everyone, Dennis.<eos> I know your son.<eos> - I'm sorry?<eos> - Clay.
I know your son.<eos> - I'm sorry?<eos> - Clay.<eos> He visited the house.<eos> And the store.
You should not be handling a gun.<eos> I know what I'm doing!<eos> This is a Glock 19.<eos> Holds up to 15 rounds.<eos> Single action.
I think I will join you.<eos> I found Jeff.<eos> I was the first person at that accident, and I found him.<eos> In his car.<eos> Dead.
You've done that before.<eos> I guess I have.<eos> But not this time.<eos> Part of me was saying, "Ask me again."<eos> Well, um... happy homeworking.
Well, um... happy homeworking.<eos> Thanks.<eos> If you'll excuse me, ma'am, this rebel is going to tear out into the night on his sweet ride.<eos> - But part of me was saying, "Don't go." - Onward!<eos> Not even for Clay.
Bye, Mom.<eos> Be safe.<eos> Call me if you need a ride!<eos> Don't do any hard drugs!<eos> Or any drugs.
He didn't say why he thought that way, but...<eos> Did you ask him?<eos> I intended to, but he's out for three days.<eos> We should see what we can find out when he gets back, or if you hear anything else from the other kids.<eos> For the lawsuit?
Yes. I guess we just hope for more for our children.<eos> We'll probably live longer, if that helps.<eos> If your generation doesn't destroy the planet first.<eos> It's too late, I'm afraid.<eos> Clay, about the Baker trial...
Helluva thing.<eos> Can you believe we moved here for peace of mind?<eos> They're still talking.<eos> Jesus!<eos> Fucking Hannah!
- You fucking cut it out!<eos> Whoa, Monty, come on, back off.<eos> Get your fucking hands off me.<eos> - You touch me again, I'll kill you. - Jesus!<eos> Enough!
Either of them.<eos> What?<eos> Justin went to Bryce's last night.<eos> He freaked because Jess was flirting with Bryce. So he called Bryce a rapist, and told Jessica that everything on the tapes was true.<eos> No fucking way.
You guys would make shitty chess players.<eos> We're two moves from being checkmated.<eos> Not necessarily.<eos> Not if we bring Bryce into it with us.<eos> Bryce.
Hannah! Hannah Baker!<eos> Hey, Jess.<eos> Can you do me a huge favor and grab me a slice of pepperoni?<eos> Sure.<eos> Hannah! Me too!
You're gonna get grease in the water.<eos> Think of it as a moisturizing spa treatment.<eos> I read that pepperoni oil reduces cellulite.<eos> I read that too, except it only works mixed with cheese.<eos> And tomato sauce.
And I can't explain it... but sitting there under the stars... I felt at peace for the first time in days.<eos> Oh, my God, are they gonna do it right in here?<eos> Nah, there's, like, eight rooms in that house.<eos> Sorry! I'm so sorry, Hannah!<eos> No worries.
Who knows what happens with them.<eos> This tape... This tape blows up the world.<eos> Which is what we should do, don't you think?<eos> Did you consider Hannah a friend?<eos> Not really.
- Justin!<eos> - Jess, please.<eos> I've been walking around all night.<eos> I've got no place to live, okay?<eos> Shit...
You telling me to watch my temper is like Justin Foley telling me to lay off the weed.<eos> Where is that guy, anyway?<eos> No clue.<eos> You figure your shit out?<eos> From the other night?
School.<eos> Myself.<eos> The people here.<eos> My parents.<eos> Your parents?
I saw how guys treated her.<eos> I have pictures of it.<eos> You have pictures of physical abuse?<eos> You have proof?<eos> No, no, not physical abuse, but...
Good God.<eos> That's right.<eos> Don't adjust your... whatever device you're hearing this on.<eos> It's me, live and in stereo.<eos> No return engagements, no encore...
I intend to assume command here, pursue the governor, and capture his ship whole.<eos> Is that so?<eos> We'll need to take her without the use of our great guns.<eos> It will be technically beyond your capacities.<eos> Without the guns?
Nothing but you.<eos> Why would you want to do that?<eos> This is what it would be.<eos> Time after time after time.<eos> Endlessly.
This is how they survive.<eos> You must know this.<eos> You're too smart not to know this.<eos> They paint the world full of shadows... and then tell their children to stay close to the light.<eos> Their light.
You must know this.<eos> You're too smart not to know this.<eos> They paint the world full of shadows... and then tell their children to stay close to the light.<eos> Their light.<eos> Their reasons, their judgments.
The man you know could never let go of his war.<eos> For if he were to exclude it from himself, he would not be able to understand himself.<eos> So I had to return him to an earlier state of being.<eos> One in which he could function without the war.<eos> Without the violence.
For if he were to exclude it from himself, he would not be able to understand himself.<eos> So I had to return him to an earlier state of being.<eos> One in which he could function without the war.<eos> Without the violence.<eos> Without us.
The kid, too.<eos> So, it is a male?<eos> Height - approximately 5'9 "-5'10".<eos> And from the extent of the saponification I'd say he was probably a little overweight.<eos> Age wise...
Payment made by Mr D Walker. Genius.<eos> Then I checked Missing Persons...<eos> And... here he is...<eos> 'David Ewan Walker.<eos> 39 years old.
W-What if they find out while you're gone? What if they come back here?<eos> Do you want to leave?<eos> Just turn our backs?<eos> I want us alive.<eos> Both of us.
Is it just as cozy as you remember?<eos> You spent a lot of time on the wrong side of the door after that stupid road trip with the wife and Tina.<eos> So let's talk about now. We went out looking for your little failed project for a few hours, just around the perimeter... tip to taint, as it were... right about the time I had you thrown in here, and when I got back,<eos> I realized I... was short... a wife.<eos> Which one?
Uh, w-well, I wa...<eos> Ahh. No.<eos> As a token of my gratitude, I'm gonna send you over a few of my wives to your apartment tonight, show you a good time.<eos> Now, I don't think I have to worry about this. But who knows how truly smart you are?<eos> No sex.
That's what should've happened today.<eos> That's what I tried.<eos> And something else happened because we have done nothing to stop them.<eos> We've done nothing!<eos> Nothing.
Use the whole word.<eos> We have time. Okay.<eos> I have these vegetables they told me to bring over, and the basket's pretty heavy.<eos> For me, I mean. Probably not you.<eos> Here.
Knot-tying was from chaser.<eos> Yeah, that wasn't his real name.<eos> There were others.<eos> Were those people you lost on the way to D.C.?<eos> No, not them.
This is your life, all of you. Remember what it looks like.<eos> Remember what they did to us!<eos> You need to see this.<eos> Open your eyes!<eos> Michonne: Rick! Walkers!
Morgan... you are not stuck.<eos> Join us on this journey to create an alliance.<eos> Fight with us, and we shall defeat them so that no one will suffer under their capricious malevolence ever again.<eos> And we start once more for the fallen... for the Kingdom...<eos> Ezekiel: for the glory of victory.
Negan: You push me, and you push me.<eos> And you push me, Rick.<eos> You just tried to blow us up, right?<eos> I mean, I get me, my people.<eos> But Eugene?
I got to apologize to anybody?<eos> No.<eos> You're good.<eos> What time did you leave?<eos> Around 1:00.
Fuck you, okay?<eos> Yeah. I got to make some calls.<eos> Fuck you.<eos> FFuck!<eos> Motherfucker!
Hands up!<eos> Ice.<eos> Ice.<eos> No more fucking banging with this guy, right?<eos> No more banging.
I'm gonna... I'm gonna get with her and... and see what's out there.<eos> Like any professional fighter, I want to be paid market value, so we're gonna be testing the limits of that.<eos> But listen. No...<eos> No...<eos> No disrespect.
I don't care about the fucking money.<eos> Lisa will figure it out.<eos> I'm on your side, Nate.<eos> I'm not trying to get in your business.<eos> Beer?
I brought you something.<eos> Thanks, love.<eos> I'm going to Burbank later to pick up a new girl.<eos> Where is she from?<eos> Florida.
- Thank you, pal.<eos> How you want to do this going forward?<eos> Uh, no change, man.<eos> Fight's in California, right?<eos> - No TRT.
Well, it doesn't feel like it because there's not even an offer and they're treating me like shit, so fuck them.<eos> Take a deep breath and let it play out.<eos> Hey, hey, if they... if they fuck around, they're gonna lose me.<eos> You tell them that.<eos> Motherfucker.
But I learned my lesson, though.<eos> Yeah. We all do.<eos> Where you from?<eos> You sound... You sound familiar.<eos> The Bronx.
King Kulina casts a long shadow, brother.<eos> Well, I don't know about that.<eos> You do. You do.<eos> You ever head back?<eos> - To New York?
- And that's why they call it a Legends fight.<eos> - You are definitely a legend.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Mm. Honor thy father.<eos> Mmm. Fuck.
Love the culture of it, you know?<eos> Around the world.<eos> Germans and Chinese and Mongolians, fucking Chileans... We're all fucking drinking.<eos> You know why that is?<eos> Three reasons.
I think I'm actually gonna take a couple days off.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But I'll, uh... I'll see you at the baptism.<eos> What baptism?<eos> For Maya?
Is this where I do my shows?<eos> Well, I spoke to Alvey, and we'd like to offer you the job.<eos> Let's do it.<eos> Yes.<eos> Mother fucker.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You go up there.<eos> I'll meet you up there.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Who's that from?<eos> Ryan.
I'll meet you up there.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Who's that from?<eos> Ryan.<eos> "To Maya.
Wait a second.<eos> What place would be better?<eos> I don't know.<eos> How about...<eos> Wisconsin?
Alvey will be here shortly.<eos> Yes.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> This question's for Matt.<eos> No kidding.
Those guys were too rough with her.<eos> They hurt her.<eos> Fuck that.<eos> She was fine last night.<eos> Fuck you.
I pray to God he has my hair.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Hey. What's happening?<eos> I need a muscle relaxer and a painkiller.<eos> Not too strong, though.
Moving on.<eos> Dude, you don't have to do this.<eos> Man, come on.<eos> Do what?<eos> This.
So you just came in and he was gone?<eos> - No note?
Okay, okay, you guys need to get off my property.<eos> You got so much, and you can't give a little?<eos> That's fucked up.<eos> You need to go.<eos> Goodbye.
- Not too sweet.<eos> - Yeah, yeah.<eos> All right. You ready to go home?<eos> Leg!<eos> Lift! Nice!
All right. You ready to go home?<eos> Leg!<eos> Lift! Nice!<eos> Nice! Nice!<eos> Off the fence. Off the fence.
There you go!<eos> Work the body! Work the body!<eos> Beautiful! Beautiful!<eos> Nice! Nice!<eos> Off the fence! Off the fence!
Do you want to slap me?<eos> Can I?<eos> No.<eos> I don't get hit for free.<eos> The fuck?
Yeah, yeah.<eos> Yeah, he's...<eos> Shannon, Skylar, get those garbage cans and bring 'em in.<eos> Honey, can you get the mail?<eos> No cuffs.
Having a couple of drinks.<eos> Who were you with?<eos> Myself.<eos> What time did you get home?<eos> 1:00, 1:00 somethin'.
You're working half as much as the other girls.<eos> Maybe it's not what you thought it would be.<eos> Whatever.<eos> This place is just a steppingstone.<eos> To what?
Don't do that.<eos> You call me.<eos> You call Alvey.<eos> You call Lisa.<eos> Anybody, right?
- Yeah.<eos> I mean, you can't... you can't fault him for that.<eos> Looking out for your career, right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - His... his, too.
I mean, you can't... you can't fault him for that.<eos> Looking out for your career, right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - His... his, too.<eos> His, too.
- Yeah.<eos> - His... his, too.<eos> His, too.<eos> You're a business, man, you know?<eos> Motherfucker.
All right, all right.<eos> Okay.<eos> This...<eos> - This. - Mac.<eos> Top of the fucking line.
I don't know what the hell he was doing out there.<eos> He was out of control.<eos> 5 grand doesn't suck.<eos> No, it doesn't.<eos> To your brother.
Is that what you want for yourself?<eos> Maybe I just want you to care if I run away yelling!<eos> Who saved room for pill brûlée?<eos> I can see why you chose this family-friendly restaurant to represent your cerebellum.<eos> So safe, so comfortable, so Shoney's.
I'm working with a mixed bag here, so you may not have perfect coordination, Morty... Ugh!<eos> - I-I didn't do that!<eos> Okay, this is exciting.<eos> We're making some discoveries about muscle memory.<eos> Help!
- I-I didn't do that!<eos> Okay, this is exciting.<eos> We're making some discoveries about muscle memory.<eos> Help!<eos> Help!
Tell it to my bread in the morning.<eos> You just became my backup toaster.<eos> Aw, geez, my sister died in the spaghetti.<eos> Graze my genitals again, Taint Washer, and you'll be shipped to the wasteland.<eos> And as for you, Genital Washer...
He's unpredictable and eccentric.<eos> The whole family is. Speaking of which...<eos> Okay, let's open things up to the whole family, and let me ask this.<eos> Why do we think Grandpa turned himself into a pickle?<eos> Wow.
Hey, listen, I know this is your world not mine.<eos> The sooner I can get out, the sooner I can go back to taking big craps, and you can go back to subsisting on them.<eos> You are one driven rat.<eos> Could you be a little more driven?<eos> To the right.
No need to freak out.<eos> Whoa!<eos> Who in the toilet is this?<eos> What is it?<eos> A pickle?
Huh?<eos> Uh, no.<eos> No, nope, sorry about that.<eos> Nope, just me.<eos> Yeesh!
Yeah, let's drop the kids off and go tie one on.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> I... I liked her.<eos> So what are you thinking, like, Smokey's Tavern?<eos> Maybe Shoney's?
Rick, since it's my adventure and all, could you do me a favor?<eos> Uh, the adventure is the favor, Morty.<eos> Me sleeping on these linens is the favor.<eos> I mean, w-w-what... what are we vindicating?<eos> Comfort?
The guy ends worlds. Kind of his thing.<eos> Ohh, real scared.<eos> Real fucking on alert, high alert over here.<eos> Watch out!<eos> What the fuck? !
Not all of us.<eos> Sweetheart.<eos> Just let Titty Bean do this, Snuzzles.<eos> It's for the greater good.<eos> Greater good? Titty Bean?
Still real nice.<eos> But small, only like 10 people.<eos> Ah but you went?<eos> We had some meetings.<eos> The next day.
It's... not the best time.<eos> He said.<eos> Don't worry, I'm gonna... I'll handle it.<eos> Sorry.<eos> No tip?
Keep it?<eos> I apologize, I didn't catch your name.<eos> I'm VM Vargas.<eos> And you work for...<eos> With Narwhal yes.
With Narwhal yes.<eos> Well now. It's, see your firm, Narwhal, like I said last year, we borrowed a hefty sum.<eos> And I know you're not bona fide FDIC, but I mean, unless you boys do business differently in...<eos> Where you from?<eos> America.
No, he made it for me.<eos> - I have to... - Okay.<eos> Okay, let me flip a b-ward.<eos> Back in a sec.<eos> Oh geez, I better...
- Eden Prairie.<eos> - Huh?<eos> Ray, did you hire one your parolees to steal money from your brother?<eos> No.<eos> Not money.
It's, what are ya, it's stamps.<eos> What did you do?<eos> Listen, don't be... Putting your hands on me, you're raising the tone of your voice, not after the night I had.<eos> The risk I took on account of you.<eos> Your needs.
Oh my God.<eos> Get down, or someone'll see.<eos> I mean right in the...<eos> No way...<eos> Game over.
Laszlo Hindemith.<eos> Arrived here last month.<eos> Connecting flight from Kinshasa.<eos> He rents a place out on the airport road.<eos> Five, Amundsunveien.
He's been living here a month.<eos> Eric?<eos> Aruwamo.<eos> I think that's where Hindemith was based.<eos> The Congo.
The larvae feasted on the rat's tissues.<eos> Standard parasitical wasp outcome.<eos> Perhaps the wasps function as a vector.<eos> Like mosquitoes and malaria, deer tick and Lyme's disease, sand fly and Oncochersiasis.<eos> Oncochersiasis?
Termination of appointment.<eos> You will be given time within reason to clear your desk and to make interim arrangements.<eos> I will be in charge during the transitional period.<eos> Until a new appointment is made.<eos> New appointment.
You need to be ready; you need to see what's coming.<eos> The princess lay in the coffin of glass.<eos> Dead to the world till the end of time.<eos> And no one cared. No one remembered her.<eos> The sound of her voice, her laughter.
Smells like reindeer juice.<eos> I appreciate this, Captain Tannar.<eos> What the hell's going on?<eos> Ingrid.<eos> Fuck's sake.
Just started at the Research Centre.<eos> About two weeks ago, he dropped out. Started doing weird stuff.<eos> Pills.<eos> Animal sedatives.<eos> No shit.
Call Petra in.<eos> I'll meet you there.<eos> What?<eos> It's coming.<eos> Jesus, Hildy.
I can see that.<eos> Then why did you ask?<eos> We think it's been taken.<eos> Like the other one.<eos> Hindemith.
Good morning, Eric.<eos> Everything okay with you and Hildur?<eos> What?<eos> Of course.<eos> No reason.
- But not the shop girl?<eos> - It's too early to say for definite.<eos> What can we say... for definite?<eos> - It's all about muscimol.<eos> - Muscimol?
I am a new beginning for Nassau.<eos> And you'd trade all of that for what?<eos> 500 pieces?<eos> You think you're worth more?<eos> To the right people.
And you'd trade all of that for what?<eos> 500 pieces?<eos> You think you're worth more?<eos> To the right people.<eos> Who?
He wants to know when you're leaving.<eos> You have no intention of leaving, do you?<eos> What exactly do you suggest I tell him?<eos> Whatever the fuck you wanna tell him.<eos> Anne.
God!<eos> It's all right, I'm fine.<eos> Yeah, I sent the invoice 12 days ago.<eos> Great, I appreciate it. Thank you so much.<eos> Bye.
- Okay?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Look, I'm sure I'll see you some other time, just not today, okay?<eos> You just lost yourself a lot of customers, my friend.<eos> Unbelievable.
Ways you might not like.<eos> Don't send for me again.<eos> Fuck.<eos> - What did he say?<eos> - Nothing helpful.
You know Lieutenant Utley from the captain's staff?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Find him.<eos> Tell him I ask that he gather as much food and supplies as he can move into the fort within the next hour.<eos> The fort?
Present!<eos> Ready!<eos> - Fire!<eos> - Fire!<eos> Charge!
in our town, okay?<eos> He's departed.<eos> He's not... I don't care who it is, all right?<eos> There's a height ordinance.<eos> Nothing above 15 feet.
So, what will happen on October 14th just a couple of weeks from now?<eos> Probably nothing.<eos> But if something were to happen, it would happen here in Jarden, Texas, in Miracle.<eos> Because I get a feeling in this place sometimes, the same feeling I got when my wife awoke from a three-year coma the day I brought her here.<eos> Mary.
And then it's the president.<eos> The leader of the free fucking world.<eos> And that, my friend, is how the world ends two weeks from now.<eos> That's how they get their finger on the button.<eos> Paw.
- Oh, my God.<eos> A party?<eos> ♪ Happy birthday, dear Tommy... ♪<eos> Happy birthday, buddy.<eos> ♪ Happy birthday to you! ♪
Can't park that here.<eos> We got... City's got an ordinance.<eos> No, it's perfectly fine.<eos> Mr. Stussy himself gave me permission.<eos> Who?
We got... City's got an ordinance.<eos> No, it's perfectly fine.<eos> Mr. Stussy himself gave me permission.<eos> Who?<eos> Your employer.
- Don't...<eos> I mean... - I won't.<eos> Just give him the lay of the land.<eos> He's dead to you.<eos> To us.
Feminine hygiene deployed as a weapon.<eos> I don't know what you're...<eos> Are you listening to me?<eos> You wanna watch your tone when you talk to me, errand boy.<eos> - My tone?
I don't know what you're...<eos> Are you listening to me?<eos> You wanna watch your tone when you talk to me, errand boy.<eos> - My tone?<eos> - Your tone.
You wanna watch your tone when you talk to me, errand boy.<eos> - My tone?<eos> - Your tone.<eos> - My tone.<eos> - Yeah, your...
- It's okay, Madeline, I got it.<eos> What can we do for you, friend?<eos> Mr. Stussy, what a day. What a day.<eos> I was hoping to show the boys their new office.<eos> Their...
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> - Hi! Merry Christmas!
Think I'll get it back?<eos> I wouldn't hold your breath.<eos> Hey, while I got you, I got some info I need run.<eos> Oh, yeah, we don't do that. I'm law enforcement also, up Minnesota.<eos> Minnesota?
Okay, I'll tell you what. The plate number checks out, I'll come find you.<eos> Maybe even bring that suitcase.<eos> - Hi, Mom. - Hey, sport.<eos> How's your dad's place?<eos> Uh, good.
Did you know a fella, Thaddeus Mobley, a writer?<eos> Would've been about 35 or so years ago, here in Los Angeles.<eos> No, it's not a very clear time for me.<eos> Which?<eos> The '70s.
Yeah, pop a squat.<eos> Can I get two beers?<eos> - You want two beers? - Um...<eos> Think I'll just have a diet pop.<eos> "Diet pop."
I'm sorry?<eos> Your finger.<eos> You used to wear a ring.<eos> Divorced.<eos> Or, not yet, but... Anyway...
Well, now, what do you know.<eos> We should maybe drive up there after Arby's.<eos> Dead, apparently.<eos> The... Who?<eos> Suspect.
It's mostly missionary, if I'm being honest.<eos> We used to spice it up, but now it's about the shortest distance between two points.<eos> I've...<eos> He'd pop faster from the back, if I'm being honest, but I think it's important to look each other in the eyes when it comes to making babies. You got kids?<eos> Uh, one. Nathan.
Gloria Burgle, Eden Valley Police.<eos> I'm, uh, looking into the, uh... The, uh, murder of... Now that is...<eos> Truly, what are the odds?<eos> You said "murder"?<eos> Yes, sir, of Ennis Stussy in Eden Valley.
Do you know there are 25 chapters in the book of Genesis that refer to the feuds of brothers?<eos> Cain and Abel, most famously, but Joseph was betrayed by his brothers and sold into slavery.<eos> Not to forget the sons of Isaac.<eos> "And my brother Esau was a hairy man, "but I am a smooth man."<eos> Then not another peep.
_<eos> _<eos> Two guys...<eos> A Russian and some...<eos> Some kind of oriental.
Some shady dealings.<eos> Guys like your brother, fat cats, making secret moves, looking for quick returns.<eos> What do they care if a wad is legit or not?<eos> Didn't you say he was having money trouble a while back?<eos> In the crash, yeah.
True.<eos> This is Mister, uh...<eos> I'm an associate of Mr. Stussy's is all you need to know for now.<eos> Associate in what capacity?<eos> Ladies shoes.
- Ray?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> And that got us wondering, especially since Mr. Stussy, Raymond, his car got rammed into by another vehicle registered to your company and...<eos> Allegedly, words exchanged between Ray and a yet-to-be-identified member of your team.<eos> - My team? - Yes, sir.
A feud?<eos> 'Cause we had your brother into the station, asked him the same question, and he said...<eos> Well, I mean... Okay, we had our differences over the years.<eos> Who hasn't?<eos> Brothers and all, but nothing like a feud.
Car got her, but we'd grown attached.<eos> I was looking for my stamp.<eos> You know, I was thinking about her on the way over.<eos> I can't think of a single person doesn't like me.<eos> Except you.
I didn't mean to...<eos> No one ever does.<eos> Walk him to his car, out in the back.<eos> Make sure you're not seen.<eos> Nothing like a feud.
Nothing like a feud.<eos> Will wonders never cease?<eos> Go figure. It's a pretty common name.<eos> - There's jealousy there.<eos> - Ladies shoes.
- No, you got the other one.<eos> Okay, here's what's gonna happen.<eos> St. Cloud Homicide's gonna handle this case, and you're both gonna go back to...<eos> What'd you do?<eos> Traffic enforcement.
Oh, jeez.<eos> - Not now. Gloria Burgle.<eos> Eden Valley police. You had one of mine on the bus. Nikki Swango?<eos> We're still doing a head count. There's some dead from the crash, - others from the assault.<eos> - Assault?
I'm sorry about your arm. No, it's...<eos> You were surprised, is all.<eos> After what happened to Sy... Your darn brother.<eos> You want me to call him?<eos> My brother?
You were surprised, is all.<eos> After what happened to Sy... Your darn brother.<eos> You want me to call him?<eos> My brother?<eos> No. Mr. Varga.
Your dead brother?<eos> How interesting.<eos> Listen.<eos> I think we should... I think we need more men.<eos> What kind of men?
How interesting.<eos> Listen.<eos> I think we should... I think we need more men.<eos> What kind of men?<eos> Short men? Melancholy?
There's some papers to sign.<eos> You're selling a shopping mall.<eos> I own a shopping mall?<eos> What?<eos> Help!
You're selling a shopping mall.<eos> I own a shopping mall?<eos> What?<eos> Help!<eos> Help!
It's my fault.<eos> Did he sign the papers?<eos> Emmit, we've talked about this. If you don't sign the papers, we don't make the money.<eos> No.<eos> No more papers. No more signing.
Have a drink, you'll feel better. No.<eos> Are you out of your mind?<eos> Nice drink, refreshing.<eos> Are you threatening me?<eos> No, no, no, the whole thing.
He died last year.<eos> Complications from polio.<eos> For six months, I wore black and tore my sleeves.<eos> And then, I had a revelation of my own.<eos> Parking lots.
I can't...<eos> So, nope, say it again?<eos> I'm saying Maurice, the fellow with his head caved in, it wasn't a random robbery.<eos> He was hired by another fellow to rob somebody.<eos> His brother.
So, nope, say it again?<eos> I'm saying Maurice, the fellow with his head caved in, it wasn't a random robbery.<eos> He was hired by another fellow to rob somebody.<eos> His brother.<eos> Maurice's brother?
Not out of the car ten seconds, when down he goes, flat on his face.<eos> One minute, he's waving hello, the next, just drops like... Like the lights go out.<eos> I killed him.<eos> -Your dad?<eos> -Ray.
What matters is he signs those papers.<eos> And we get him out of that precinct before he gets too chatty.<eos> I can monitor the radios, see if there's a workaround to the new security.<eos> No, let's move shop, go to stage four.<eos> No mistakes.
OrshouldIsay Switzerlandzz91482s?<eos> No, account numbers mean nothing without their passwords, without the answer to six security questions.<eos> Wasitsix? Thanks. Thoughtit wasfive.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Your name, for starters.
So, this was a business dinner?<eos> Well, I'm new in town and buck agreed to introduce me to some people.<eos> New from where?<eos> Does it matter?<eos> St. Louis.
-My...<eos> Did you tell her, Donny?<eos> Well, I solved it.<eos> Solved what?<eos> Your murders.
Did you tell her, Donny?<eos> Well, I solved it.<eos> Solved what?<eos> Your murders.<eos> The old-timer in Eden valley and then the dead po.
Your murders.<eos> The old-timer in Eden valley and then the dead po.<eos> Don't even.<eos> I got the parking lot king in holding, he confessed.<eos> To both?
Those are facts.<eos> I got... hold on.<eos> I got different facts.<eos> Maurice lefay's fingerprints-- he confessed.<eos> My guy. In the car ride over. All four murders.
After everything he's been through.<eos> I'm done. Give me back my papers and get out!<eos> Are you a fan of progress, Mr. Stussy?<eos> - Technology?<eos> - No more talking.
Emmit, my dear Emmit. How are you?<eos> You look...<eos> Well, I know this can't be easy for you.<eos> You work for Varga.<eos> All this time.
You look like you've seen better days, friend.<eos> - You okay there?<eos> - I am not.<eos> - Where you headed?<eos> - Wisconsin.
I want to insta-print a couple of sets of business cards.<eos> And I may need your assistance with printing some posters.<eos> Snow. Snow. Snow.<eos> I think that's enough.<eos> Enough what?
And I may need your assistance with printing some posters.<eos> Snow. Snow. Snow.<eos> I think that's enough.<eos> Enough what?<eos> Snow.
Forget about a trial, this thing won't even make it through evidentiary.<eos> You haven't heard the bad news.<eos> They have a witness.<eos> What?<eos> Who?
Seven long years they've been waiting, and you are their Super Lotto ticket.<eos> They're gonna be so thrilled.<eos> Why don't you go ahead and sign the contract so I can call the Stolnjaks?<eos> You're doing a wonderful thing for this family.<eos> And for your baby.
Excuse me, I need to use the bathroom.<eos> It's great that she's got you for support, Reverend Curtis.<eos> It just tears my heart to see some of these young girls just get left in the cold by men who don't care enough to do the right thing.<eos> Not even by their own kid.<eos> No moral backbone.
But I know God won't fail us.<eos> Listen, Keith, I'm trying to make this situation right for both of us.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But they got a witness.<eos> Who?
Whatever.<eos> You know I'm right.<eos> When you start lactating, now that shit's a goldmine.<eos> - They want to suck it...<eos> - Carla.
You remember that?<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> But I remember everything, and it's not enough.<eos> Even for love.<eos> Asa?
So you're not interested in getting to know people face to face, but you want to collect every single bit of information about them behind their backs.<eos> Is there any real difference between me watching that woman over there walk across the room, or watching her surf across the web?<eos> Yes, there is, she has no expectation of privacy here.<eos> And what has the expectation of privacy on the web given us?<eos> Silk road?
Just to be safe.<eos> I can get you an extra thousand.<eos> Machine's booked at 5 p.m.<eos> Four hours is the best I can do.<eos> Asa.
Yeah, I've seen her do it.<eos> Can we play the video for her?<eos> I can ask.<eos> Good job today.<eos> - Bye.
It'll make a nice HQ.<eos> I'm sure our maid here will keep it tidy, right?<eos> Right?<eos> Now throw this sack of shit to the vultures!<eos> UNCERTAIN GLORY
This whole battalion is disgusting.<eos> No hygiene or culture.<eos> As long as they will fight for their ideals...<eos> Nobody here has ideals.<eos> Or principles...
Just him, and a maid who is out with the boys.<eos> Mrs Olivella.<eos> Forgive my boldness.<eos> The Captain sent me about the horse.<eos> - The horse...
I like them more than people.<eos> BARCELONA<eos> Hurry up.<eos> Here.<eos> At your service.
Here.<eos> At your service.<eos> Comrade!<eos> Eat your onion.<eos> Trini!
- He hasn't written for months.<eos> - That place is a mess.<eos> But don't worry, the front itself is quiet.<eos> Not like here then. People don't realise how hellish life is in Barcelona.<eos> Ramonet!
One year, the spring won't return.<eos> April, that month of uncertain glory, is slipping through our fingers.<eos> Uncertain or not, it's the only glory.<eos> What comes after will be nausea.<eos> Lieutenant!
Trust me, and look after those who really need you.<eos> It's an air raid!<eos> Everybody out!<eos> - Give me a loaf.<eos> - Outside, Trini.
- Shut up! Don't you see he's right?<eos> Children shouldn't have to pay for their parents' sins.<eos> That's right.<eos> You're doing the right thing.<eos> What the hell.
We have a visitor.<eos> Olivella?<eos> Come in, Father.<eos> It's good to see you.<eos> Not for me.
Don't let the villagers see you.<eos> Fermín, do we have petrol?<eos> Yes, one of those large cans.<eos> Take the cover off the car.<eos> Bandido.
Fermín, do we have petrol?<eos> Yes, one of those large cans.<eos> Take the cover off the car.<eos> Bandido.<eos> Bandido.
You don't care if he's dead or alive?<eos> No, I don't.<eos> And neither should you.<eos> Who's that?<eos> The Carlana.
No, I don't.<eos> And neither should you.<eos> Who's that?<eos> The Carlana.<eos> The Lady of the Manor.
Don't you think, Lluís?<eos> And such sadness in her eyes.<eos> María, put my mourning clothes away - and starch my coloured suits. - Yes, ma'am.<eos> And send in Fermín. Hurry.<eos> Olivella.
Who are you praying for?<eos> For someone I love very much.<eos> Did he give you that stone?<eos> It's not a stone, it's a jewel.<eos> From Master Lluís?
You were lucky to get it.<eos> Yes, very lucky.<eos> - Mummy, I've finished.<eos> - I'll go.<eos> Merry Christmas.
Yes.<eos> To our wives!<eos> I don't know how we've survived without them.<eos> But don't think the women here have forgotten us.<eos> Cigars from the Lady of the Manor.
- The whole village knows!<eos> It's so humiliating.<eos> Don't touch me!<eos> Never touch me again!<eos> Trini.
Juli.<eos> I had it analyzed.<eos> And?<eos> It's like you.<eos> From another planet.
And?<eos> It's like you.<eos> From another planet.<eos> Where were you? I don't have to explain myself to you.<eos> Trini, not now.
I've nothing to lose.<eos> But you can't really say the same.<eos> So you want to humiliate me to make up for another woman's humiliation and to restore your friend's honour?<eos> - You think this will make it better?<eos> - Not for them. But for me.
Don't take him from me.<eos> Please, God.<eos> Listen, Trini.<eos> Why don't you ask the Carlana?<eos> The Carlana?
How did it go?<eos> I'll find out tonight.<eos> Is it certain? No, Trini.<eos> Then go to see the Carlana.<eos> The Carlana?
What will you do?<eos> - I've taken steps to get some.<eos> - What steps?<eos> The Carlana will give it to me.<eos> The Carlana?
Bring me a couple eggs when you come back in.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Hello.<eos> Marius Josepovitch.<eos> - Josepovich.
No, no, no.<eos> You promised me this was going to be simple.<eos> Carrie, don't worry about it.<eos> I'm close to getting some big money, okay?<eos> How big?
Whatever else he is, he is not lazy.<eos> Business took off, and pretty soon, they were buying out bond shops all over the state.<eos> Now they're the biggest in Connecticut, and they're out to bankrupt us.<eos> Libby Metzger wants to get her son out of jail.<eos> - Which one?
Not if it's in your trunk.<eos> You're no fun.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> How did you get out?<eos> Of the safe?
No one knows what it is or does.<eos> I met some good people who are trying to stop it.<eos> Ihopethereare others.<eos> We barely got out of that hellhole alive.<eos> Hell, goddamn...
All of them.<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> I'll catch up with you in a minute.<eos> Roger that, gunny.<eos> Someday. (Theme music playing)
- It's just a precaution. - That why the door to this room stay locked from the outside, ke?<eos> You martian, keya?<eos> This a martian ship.<eos> Haven't seen a martian ship dock at Eros for years.<eos> Or an earth ship, for that matter.
And the quarantine of Eros station continues to be a source of debate, as relief organizations testify before the general assembly, urging the u.N... (Sighs)<eos> Jurisdictionalissues...<eos> Hey, you been having trouble... What?<eos> Working the plumbing?<eos> - No. - Which end?
(Indistinct cheering) She's doing it again!<eos> You can do it!<eos> You can do it! You got this!<eos> Hey, hey! You owe me a bottle.<eos> Ganymede bourbon, not the cheap shit, eh!
We'll keep him anyway.<eos> - Hey!<eos> - Watch it!<eos> Well put, gunny.<eos> Lieutenant.
She's a sacred part of it now.<eos> So don't talk to me about sacrifice ever again.<eos> Naomi: This'll kill any cancer that dares try to grow inside you. Miller:<eos> Ow! How long I got to wear this?<eos> Naomi: Rest of your days.
Look, I will find a way to fix this.<eos> What are you talkin' about?<eos> ! - Somebody! Get me out of here!<eos> - Hey. I promise you...<eos> Help!
Fantasy.<eos> You... you have no evidence of this whatsoever.<eos> What's the range of the S400?<eos> More than 250 miles.<eos> - Up to what altitudes?
- Listen, I gotta go.<eos> I'll write up the report on the flight home.<eos> Good.<eos> I just needed the folder, Mr. Greenburg. For the shredder.<eos> No worries.
This is my home.<eos> - I need a favor.<eos> - Of course you do.<eos> I need the transcript of a call placed between these two numbers<eos> - within 24 hours of this date.
I am going to Nigeria with my mother and my sister.<eos> We've been trying to get over there for the last 14 years.<eos> Ever since my father got deported.<eos> That money was a loan to help pay for that.<eos> From whom?
Presidents don't get chances.<eos> They get tested.<eos> Oh, what is that supposed to mean?<eos> We have intel from our partners that the Iranians are cheating on the nuclear deal.<eos> Which partners?
They get tested.<eos> Oh, what is that supposed to mean?<eos> We have intel from our partners that the Iranians are cheating on the nuclear deal.<eos> Which partners?<eos> The Saudis?
Oh, what is that supposed to mean?<eos> We have intel from our partners that the Iranians are cheating on the nuclear deal.<eos> Which partners?<eos> The Saudis?<eos> Israelis.
Wipes?<eos> - Wha... - Where are the baby wipes?<eos> Right there in front of him.<eos> Huggies. White wrapper.<eos> Right there.
Your Honor, Mr. Mahsud has been the key resource in several federal prosecutions.<eos> Lives have been saved.<eos> His ability to continue that important work depends on his identity remaining a closely held secret.<eos> - I need to talk to you.<eos> - What secret?
But I'm not guilty.<eos> All that matters is if they can convince a jury you are.<eos> How long?<eos> Seven years.<eos> Years?
What was so urgent I had to fight my way across town to get here?<eos> You're going to Abu Dhabi.<eos> The Mossad operation.<eos> There's been a request you represent us on the ground there.<eos> From whom?
Yeah. I do.<eos> She laughed in my face.<eos> She's a menace. Carrie is.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Just not at the moment to us.
Look, Pittsburgh was different.<eos> Those were drug dealers.<eos> Those were murderers.<eos> They got what they deserved.<eos> But not Sekou.
Talked, mostly.<eos> Lot of catching up to do.<eos> I bet.<eos> Must have been up late.<eos> - Till 3:00, 3:30.
I bet.<eos> Must have been up late.<eos> - Till 3:00, 3:30.<eos> - Just the two of you, was it?<eos> No dinner guests, unexpected visitors?
I'm afraid the President-elect will have to do without you for a while.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Your flight was cancelled.<eos> Mechanical problem.<eos> Unbelievable.
Because there's one other thing.<eos> Because in the apartment across the street, somebody's watching.<eos> I saw, by the window, the...<eos> these... these small, in the carpet, small holes.<eos> No, not holes.
I never signed anything.<eos> Well, then you're opening yourself up to re-arrest.<eos> For what?<eos> Exposing an FBI informant, for one thing.<eos> That asshole?
I really need to see him.<eos> Yeah, I got that.<eos> Your guy's not here.<eos> They took him straight to Bellevue.<eos> - The psych ward?
- Excuse me?<eos> - I didn't ask for this.<eos> I put in a request for a surveillance file... on Tovah Rivlin.<eos> - Tovah Rivlin?<eos> - Mossad.
I need to confirm her contacts and travel for the 10 days prior.<eos> Shit. I do remember that now... your request.<eos> I meant to sign off, but it's been all about the bomb the last couple of days. It completely slipped my mind.<eos> What's the concern? May I ask?<eos> No concern.
I wouldn't be asking if I didn't absolutely have to know.<eos> You're right, sir. The chief was not... totally forthcoming with you. She...<eos> She's off the leash, sir. Tovah Rivlin is.<eos> There's a standing no-surveillance order on her, at least for here in New York.<eos> On whose authority?
Your face is all over the Internet.<eos> You don't think I know that?<eos> I got people out there after my ass.<eos> I need protection.<eos> Protection?
That guy in the photo you sent me? Not an associate of Sekou Bah.<eos> I ran his photo through NGI.<eos> They came up empty, just like you.<eos> So we still have no idea who he is.<eos> Almost none.
I'm here to see the president-elect.<eos> - She's expecting me.<eos> - Just a second, sir.<eos> How did you get this address?<eos> From the e-mail.
- She's expecting me.<eos> - Just a second, sir.<eos> How did you get this address?<eos> From the e-mail.<eos> What e-mail?
Yeah. Yeah, there's some psychological issues.<eos> Including violent outbursts.<eos> He hated it at the V.A.<eos> Still, you moved him into your house.<eos> No, in-into the basement.
It's a separate apartment. Uh-huh.<eos> There's a door that locks.<eos> There were very strict rules in place.<eos> E-Everything was fine. Right.<eos> Until the bombing.
There were police everywhere.<eos> Well, weren't they there because Mr. Quinn was holding Franny and your nanny hostage?<eos> - No! That is not accurate.<eos> - He wasn't holding them hostage?<eos> Not from his point of view.
Break the terms, and you're a national-security risk.<eos> Do I like a f-fucking risk to you?<eos> You shot a civilian, Peter.<eos> In the... safe place!<eos> Yeah, with a handgun, from distance.
Your friend the banker, Farhad Nafisi.<eos> He's a little hard to recognize, I admit.<eos> Wild guess...<eos> He's working for Mossad.<eos> For the past eight years.
Not the first thing.<eos> Yeah, well... we're all beautiful when we're young, aren't we?<eos> Fucking... dirty old man.<eos> Fair enough.<eos> For the record, though, I...
Yeah, I did.<eos> Carrie told me.<eos> What'd she say?<eos> That I... flatlined and was dead for three minutes.<eos> Not exactly.
The second I get the other half of the money, I'm gone.<eos> - $45 million. - Mm.<eos> It goes a long way in, what is it, Costa Rica?<eos> I think I'll keep my retirement plans to myself.<eos> - No offense.
Just listen.<eos> - Listen to what? - Shh!<eos> If it makes any difference, some said ship you back to Tehran.<eos> I told them that was just cruel.<eos> Completely unacceptable.
Hardware, software, security clearance.<eos> Triple threat.<eos> I'm assuming that this is PRISM?<eos> - Okay.<eos> - For the Agency?
He's in the building.<eos> Not too late to cancel.<eos> The meeting's been scheduled.<eos> I can sub in for you.<eos> No. No changes.
Can I get you something to drink?<eos> It's still a little early for me.<eos> What I have is coffee or juice.<eos> Oh. Coffee.<eos> Light.
And you should be paying attention.<eos> I can't right now, Max. The car will be here any minute.<eos> I'm going straight from my deposition to see Franny at Child Services.<eos> Toss me Hop, would you?<eos> - Hop?
I'm afraid you're taking this personally, madam.<eos> You're God damn right I am.<eos> I'm sorry if I upset you.<eos> In the future, in case you're wondering, this moment, right now, is when I decided to put your ass in jail.<eos> Good day.
Those of you with families won't be going home tonight.<eos> Those of you with hot dates, consider them iced.<eos> Bus is coming for us in 90.<eos> Sorry for the late notice, gentlemen, but Intel just found us some shitheads.<eos> - Who?
Please pay the bill and leave the cafe immediately, turning right and onto 77th Street.<eos> Midway down the block, cross the street."<eos> "At the corner of Central Park West, a silver Range Rover will pull up beside you."<eos> "Get in."<eos> Inside-- quickly.
- taking fire.<eos> - And what did Captain Keane do?<eos> He ran past me.<eos> He was shouting.<eos> Out of the way!
You can trust her.<eos> She will bring you to me.<eos> It's important.<eos> Where did you get this?<eos> Metro PCS.
Well, I guess it's better than being called a bitch.<eos> You've sat down with a few Presidents, I imagine.<eos> - Three or four.<eos> - Any of them face anything like I'm facing right now?<eos> Not like this.
What we do know is that everything she said she would do was a lie.<eos> Repeal the PATRIOT Act?<eos> Well, she... she's expanded it.<eos> Restore the rule of law?<eos> What rule of law?
It was never my intention for things to turn so dark.<eos> Ultimately, I lost control of what I set in motion.<eos> You remember what Graham Greene said, don't you?<eos> About what?<eos> The secret services.
- Hi.<eos> - Come in.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Can I get you something...<eos> Coffee, tea?
Can I get you something...<eos> Coffee, tea?<eos> No, thank you. I'm fine.<eos> So, where do you want to start?<eos> Well, how about Franny's room?
Ronald, I need to see the President.<eos> - She's not available.<eos> - It's urgent.<eos> Ma'am, we've been ordered to escort you out of the building. - Ordered?<eos> By who?
- She's not available.<eos> - It's urgent.<eos> Ma'am, we've been ordered to escort you out of the building. - Ordered?<eos> By who?<eos> - Mr. Wellington.
Is it?<eos> - Of course it is.<eos> I don't believe you. Who else is here?<eos> - Who did Dar Adal send?<eos> - Nobody.
Saul and I sometimes speak when it's mutually beneficial.<eos> Well, I need some straight talk now.<eos> That's why I'm here.<eos> As far as you know, is there a concerted effort to get me to withdraw my support for the nuclear agreement?<eos> Undoubtedly yes.
Move, move, move!<eos> We're taking too much fire!<eos> This is where it gets good.<eos> We got two down!<eos> Out of the way!
We got two down!<eos> Out of the way!<eos> Get out of my fucking way!<eos> Meet Andrew Keane, the only son of the President-elect.<eos> Out of the way!
Your medication and identity papers are in your room.<eos> Hey, listen, I-<eos> - I f-f-fucked up.<eos> - I'm fucked up.<eos> - No shit.
Then why not ask him about it?<eos> He'd rather I didn't know.<eos> Can you get into his computer?<eos> No.<eos> Not even for Quinn?
Perhaps I can remind you.<eos> ...Captain Keane do?<eos> He ran past me.<eos> He was shouting...<eos> "Out of the way!
Well, they're out in the open now, thanks to you.<eos> Excuse me, ma'am.<eos> The- - The protest has grown in front of the hotel.<eos> We can go in the back.<eos> No, the front.
Tell me about it.<eos> What is so special about February 7th, huh?<eos> That's the first time I got shot.<eos> That's why it's so funny.<eos> "February 7, 2014."
You know, honestly, when I got the call, I thought it was some kind of sick joke.<eos> You and your daughter seem to have the same sense of humor.<eos> I need a priest.<eos> - A priest?<eos> - Yeah. A priest.
Right?<eos> Joking.<eos> It was just that we all came running back in to help and there's nothing to do.<eos> Bed 3. Guy's been waiting for a plastics consult<eos> - for over an hour.
- Great.<eos> - What was your name?<eos> Alex Reid.<eos> Emmanuel Palmer.<eos> Vascular.
There it is above the left renal artery.<eos> Needle driver.<eos> Ready for the surgical version of the 100-meter dash?<eos> - Whew. - 1 minute 40 seconds left.<eos> So... about that ring.
Luck's not in charge here.<eos> I am.<eos> Next few hours are critical, and we're doing everything we can to manage her bleeding.<eos> Just hang in there and you will see her, all right?<eos> Dr. Dustiny?
This thing's really starting to kill.<eos> Unfortunately, you are maxed out, my friend.<eos> - I'd like a second opinion.<eos> - He's right.<eos> No more meds.
You know him.<eos> Well... back in the day, after Victor, before Jonathan, I was a committed patron at his place of business.<eos> I-I never had you pegged for a-a Lumberjaxxx kind of guy, Shahir.<eos> Hmm.<eos> Yeah. Dr. Dustiny.
It's not that.<eos> It's-it's this arm.<eos> Okay, it's not a bigger bleed.<eos> It's a different pulsatile bleed altogether.<eos> Sponges.
I want to save lives, not bums.<eos> You wanna go back to school at your age?<eos> Careful, careful.<eos> Watch the ageism, Chief.<eos> Dana, residency.
Your queen!<eos> Peace was secured with hostages, Brida and Ragnar, and by the Danish earl's baptism and acceptance of the Christian God.<eos> As for Uhtred, the godless? My path led North, to blood feuds, to revenge... and to Bebbanburg.<eos> Destiny is all.<eos> No mercy!
No, Lord.<eos> Influence beyond Wessex, Odda.<eos> Heaven sent.<eos> Come on, move on. Move on. _<eos> - Good day.
Her memory should be cherished, not lost in a fog of ale and bosoms.<eos> My sword.<eos> Are we to ride to Northumbria, or to the next inn and the next jug of ale?<eos> What am I to do in Northumbria with an army of two, a nun and a rag-arse?<eos> A loyal rag-arse.
You have enough men, keep them sober and do not kill for the fun of it.<eos> No, Lord.<eos> You do me a great honour, Lord, though I wish I was going with you.<eos> Remember, what we need more than silver is women!<eos> Red-haired women!
God bless you.<eos> We take care of the horses... and then I find Alfred's priest.<eos> We carry it all, we must.<eos> But what guarantee do we have that he will not steal Alfred's silver?<eos> None.
Help us to free Guthred, protect the ransom until it is delivered, and I'm sure that we'll be rewarded.<eos> Your bargain is with whom?<eos> A slave master.<eos> The village in which we are meeting sits on land that belongs to someone from your past.<eos> Kjartan.
You are Sven Kjartanson?<eos> You will answer me!<eos> What do you want with Sven Kjartanson?<eos> I've been sent to take the souls of both Kjartan and his son.<eos> Attack...
You will answer me!<eos> What do you want with Sven Kjartanson?<eos> I've been sent to take the souls of both Kjartan and his son.<eos> Attack...<eos> Attack!
Uhtred, I believe you would find a goat in a skirt to be pretty.<eos> Goodnight.<eos> The cocksure long-haired fool over there. Is he a danger?<eos> - To whom, Abbot?<eos> - To each one of us, and to our purpose.
Consider yourself warned.<eos> I just got off my shift. Do you wanna go grab a drink?<eos> Can I take a rain check?<eos> I just got back from a business trip.<eos> Business trip?
- Yes, I can do that.<eos> - Excellent.<eos> We'll see you then.<eos> - Who was that?<eos> - Work.
What the...?<eos> !<eos> Jesus, Florence!<eos> He wasn't coming.<eos> What the fuck? !
And I have no fucking memory how I got there or what happened while I did.<eos> Also, God did not talk to me.<eos> And I'm thinking this is a fucking waste of time, at best, a misguided detour... when I notice the TV in the hotel room is on.<eos> And do you know what I saw on that TV, Chris?<eos> A chicken.
Can you see the problem?<eos> Yeah, your swamp cooler's leaking like a motherfucker.<eos> - Can you fix it, then?<eos> - You got a pipe wrench or some duct tape...<eos> Shit!
I'm sorry.<eos> Know that you gave your life... For something greater than yourself.<eos> Come on!<eos> Shit!<eos> Help.
Are you all alone out here?<eos> Yes.<eos> Your family's gone?<eos> Yes.<eos> On the 14th?
Yes, it is.<eos> Who's this? There's a bus stop across the street from the hotel. The 570 will arrive in about 15 minutes.<eos> Take it to the last stop.<eos> Don't miss it. - We won't wait.<eos> Good-bye, Miss Durst.
Yes?<eos> Go on up.<eos> They're waiting for you.<eos> - "Take On Me."<eos> - Ja.
If I nod, how will the baby be killed?<eos> Will it suffer or is it gonna be quick and painless?<eos> Quick and painless.<eos> - Are they mine, the twins?<eos> - Irrelevant.
Then you should go be with them.<eos> - I need a taxi.<eos> - No taxis, sir.<eos> Why not?<eos> The explosion.
That's who everyone saw a few days later.<eos> So, you take no responsibility for your only son... giving his life for the sins of mankind?<eos> Seems a lot to ask somebody.<eos> Then what do you take responsibility for?<eos> Dinosaurs?
- Why? - To help people.<eos> To... to guide them. To ease their suffering even though I suffered myself.<eos> I sacrificed my happiness.<eos> - I let my family abandon me.<eos> - Why? For you!
He got one of Grace's horses, headed out, said he'd be back by sundown.<eos> And you think that Evie... that she's in this place, too?<eos> Why wouldn't she be?<eos> Well, so everybody wants something.<eos> A brain, a heart, courage.
His dad found him.<eos> He's with his dad? - Okay.<eos> Um, what... - You've got to come now, Laurie.<eos> - 5 Pigeon Run Road. - Okay.<eos> Outside Makarra.
- I love you, honey.<eos> Tell Tommy I love him.<eos> Mom loves you, you fucking idiot.<eos> I love you, too, Mommy!<eos> - Bye, kids.
So, let's get assassinating, shall we?<eos> Who's the target?<eos> President.<eos> - The president?<eos> - Of the United States.
Mr. Harvey, you gonna have trouble putting him down?<eos> No.<eos> But I'm gonna need something in exchange.<eos> Okay.<eos> What?
Do you know that I'm not the President of the United States?<eos> I sure do.<eos> I have a message for you from your father.<eos> My father?<eos> John.
What's in that one?<eos> Never mind about that. Just pray we don't have to open it.<eos> Sir, in order to arm the device, you need to verbally take us down to DEFCON 1.<eos> You are aware of the situation, yes?<eos> - Yeah, of course...
- So, you know, sir, that Ukrainian separatists have seized control of a nuclear submarine.<eos> They will be weapons hot in less than an hour.<eos> Our only option is to strike first, which is why you need to take us down to DEFCON 1.<eos> Uh, I have to make a phone call first.<eos> To who?
They will be weapons hot in less than an hour.<eos> Our only option is to strike first, which is why you need to take us down to DEFCON 1.<eos> Uh, I have to make a phone call first.<eos> To who?<eos> The Prime Minister of Australia.
Does he seem crazy?<eos> No.<eos> He seemed happy.<eos> Would you please stop fucking saying that?<eos> Okay.
- He must be immortal.<eos> Runs in the family, right?<eos> I'm not immortal.<eos> Says who?<eos> My cardiologist.
Without structure, disorder is only to be expected.<eos> Now, you will begin... with men that you know and trust.<eos> And from there, you will begin to reorganize your crews as quickly as possible.<eos> Crews?<eos> With no ships?
I gave you my word. I intend to honor it.<eos> This fight ahead does not belong to you, nor to your children.<eos> I won't have you bear any more of it.<eos> Would you consider joining me?<eos> To London?
To your plantations and your ships?<eos> How long before Spanish slaves are emboldened by it and set their eyes on you?<eos> When you are forced to write to King Philip, begging his assistance in staving off the army of slaves and pirates on your doorstep... would you not wish in that moment... that you had this one back... when it was possible to kill this monster in its cradle... cheap and quick and quiet?<eos> I had a younger brother once.<eos> Simón.
I want to clear you, but I need your help.<eos> How?<eos> I want to get into the CTU's subnetwork to find out who accessed the Rangers' files.<eos> To do that, I need your director's override.<eos> My override?
I went online, started talking to this guy from back home.<eos> A friend, but he didn't like this country.<eos> I started saying that stuff because I thought that was what he wanted to hear... just to keep talking to someone.<eos> But it wasn't real.<eos> Not for me, Drew.
If we don't act now, we'll achieve nothing.<eos> - You're coming with us.<eos> - I'm not going anywhere.<eos> And neither are you.<eos> Kusuma.
There's no air that needs clearing.<eos> We have nothing to talk about Andy.<eos> Agent Locke, uh, can I talk to you for a second?<eos> Sorry, who are you again?<eos> Mariana.
They're on their way over here now.<eos> I went deeper into Carter's file.<eos> Guy enlisted in the Army.<eos> Did tours in Afghanistan and Yemen, worked his way up to Special Forces.<eos> Special Forces?
- That's why I reached out to you in the first place, put this deal together.<eos> If Isaac doesn't make it back from this meeting, wouldn't be a lot of tears.<eos> Something wrong?<eos> I just, um, I had to make a phone call.<eos> To who?
All right. Where is she?<eos> She back at my place, safe and sound.<eos> I just finished up with some business. I'm heading back now.<eos> Isaac, you sure she's okay?<eos> She good, bro.
- ...information from my friend...<eos> Think about what you're doing, now.<eos> - Don't you realize... - ...at the NSA, to see if CTU...<eos> I did it for you.<eos> For me?
Why? You okay?<eos> I just, I don't want to be here anymore.<eos> Okay, listen, uh...<eos> I want you to go to Christine's.<eos> Christine's?
Right into your veins.<eos> That's not true. That's not true.<eos> Gabriel, this deal will net many times that.<eos> Look, I won't take a cut.<eos> Not a penny.
How Eric gonna send CTU here?<eos> Hmm? It's just for a minute, Isaac.<eos> - He should know better. - Just enough time for me to get in the car... relax.<eos> You don't have to go.<eos> Not right away.
Why aren't you point on this?<eos> Mullins revoked my clearance.<eos> He knows I'm the one that gave Eric Carter the classified missile specs.<eos> Some might consider what I did an act of courage.<eos> Courage?
Get ready to move out!<eos> Get ready.<eos> We're 30 seconds out.<eos> Do you miss it?<eos> What?
Oh, you're all right. Come here.<eos> God is with you, little sister.<eos> - Khasan, no.<eos> - To the end. Khasan, no. You understand me?<eos> To the end.
She's got something in her hand.<eos> No!<eos> [newscast playing quietly] ...a large explosion on the George Washington Bridge that crosses the Hudson River... This is the work of one cell.<eos> There are 14 more cells, and they must strike as one.<eos> But without the flash drive...
Mullins knows I helped Carter.<eos> He took away my clearance, and he'll fire me as soon as he figures out how.<eos> I shouldn't have gotten involved.<eos> Some might consider what I did an act of courage.<eos> Courage?
They're still out there.<eos> Okay, either we give up or we hunt them down.<eos> This is the work of one cell.<eos> There are 14 more cells, and they must strike as one.<eos> But without the flash drive...
I get it. Okay?<eos> This is a suicide play, but we are doing this to save thousands of others.<eos> There aren't that many people in this world who get a chance to make this kind of a difference.<eos> I'm gonna need a couple things.<eos> - What?
He's here with me.<eos> What the hell is going on?<eos> Your father wasn't responding to conventional interrogation.<eos> We needed to try something else.<eos> Something else?
- But sir... - You heard what I said.<eos> Don't make me ask again.<eos> _<eos> Got it.<eos> Naseri.
Put your hands above your head. Who are you?<eos> What do you want?<eos> I'm with the Counter Terrorism Unit.<eos> We're looking for Asim Naseri.<eos> Who? Who?
- Hi, Jennifer.<eos> How are you feeling?<eos> Look, I'm s-so sorry I couldn't wait for you.<eos> Isaac said you had to go after someone.<eos> Asim Naseri.
I'm listening.<eos> Rebecca isn't doing this alone.<eos> She enlisted a former Army Ranger to help her.<eos> Is that that same crazy son of a bitch who attacked those CTU agents today?<eos> Eric Carter. Yes.
On your knees.<eos> I said on your knees.<eos> Drop it.<eos> You, too, now.<eos> Over to the column.
Right behind you.<eos> Tell me what you see.<eos> It's an old football stadium.<eos> Looks like it hasn't been used in years.<eos> No sign of Jadalla or Naseri.
Naseri was talking to one of his men in Arabic.<eos> But I heard two words in English:<eos> East July.<eos> East July is a subheading of some folders in the server at the office of the DNI.<eos> Director of National Intelligence?
Well, it might've paid off.<eos> She overheard something while being held by the terrorists.<eos> Two words: "East July."<eos> It's a covert op run by the Director Of National Intelligence,<eos> Donald Simms.
Oh, my God.<eos> We were wrong... about Naseri's daughter.<eos> She's alive.<eos> According to this, she's been held at a safe house a few miles from here.<eos> For the last year.
- Those people...<eos> I'm gonna do everything I can to protect you, I promise, but I need you to go in here and don't make a sound, not until I come get you.<eos> And then what?<eos> Where will I go?<eos> Home.
Director Mullins, this girl is a Jordanian citizen.<eos> What was she doing in U.S. custody?<eos> She was the target of an unsanctioned operation by an individual in our government.<eos> The goal was to leverage her against her father,<eos> Asim Naseri.
I'm gonna consult with my state department...<eos> With all respect, sir, we-we just don't have time for that.<eos> If you don't receive the girl when we land, Rebecca Ingram will lose her life.<eos> I need a decision now.<eos> Very well.
Certainly.<eos> She's in his office right now.<eos> Thank you.<eos> They told me the funeral is going to be tomorrow.<eos> Family only.
Like we've always done.<eos> This is what we do.<eos> All I ask is one thing:<eos> that we're honest with each other.<eos> No more secrets.
This is what we do.<eos> All I ask is one thing:<eos> that we're honest with each other.<eos> No more secrets.<eos> No more secrets.
- ...before you start speaking!<eos> - P-R-O--<eos> - I don't... feel very hungry.<eos> May we go to our rooms?<eos> "Rooms"?
"Hasty" means "quickly," because I'm due at the bank soon.<eos> We know what "hasty" means.<eos> Hello there!<eos> Salutations!<eos> Shalom!
We- we bury that shit for, like, 20 years and then deal with it in therapy later.<eos> - Guess what.<eos> - What?<eos> We're opening a new office, right on Campbell street.<eos> Yeah, right next to the college.
There. You've got your opening.<eos> May I make another suggestion?<eos> Sure.<eos> In my humble opinion, allow the story of your father to have true meaning.<eos> True meaning?
That's tough.<eos> It was.<eos> We would video chat but it wasn't the same.<eos> I missed this.<eos> Family meals.
You won't do that.<eos> Oh yeah?<eos> Why not?<eos> Because of what I've got in my briefcase sitting in your kitchen.<eos> And this detonator.
That's a matter of opinion.<eos> - I'm a contractor for the CIA.<eos> The CIA?<eos> Yeah.<eos> As in the central intelligence agency?
And yet, he never did.<eos> Have you yet asked yourself why that is?<eos> My father didn't mistrust Flint.<eos> My father mistrusted all of you.<eos> Lieutenant.
My father mistrusted all of you.<eos> Lieutenant.<eos> The cache isn't here, so I am leaving.<eos> And as my collateral to ensure that this deal is consummated, he'll be coming with me to the fort.<eos> "This deal"?
Eleanor turned her guns on me.<eos> Eleanor betrayed me.<eos> Surrendered Nassau out from under me.<eos> None of that sounded like anything that would ever occur to her to do.<eos> Not her.
- I'm sure you do.<eos> The last thing I need to overhear when Mr. Guthrie rejects our proposal is, uh...<eos> Uh, Monsieur Constable, what sort of reward might one expect for aiding in 'zhe' capture of a notorious pirate captain, such as, say, oh, Jack Rackham?<eos> Really?<eos> 'Zhat' much?
Go see what kind of surgeon you can engage for Anne.<eos> I'll... do this.<eos> What?<eos> It's somehow only just occurred to me how ruined we'll be if I fail to win the man on the other side of that door to our cause.<eos> No home.
I'll... do this.<eos> What?<eos> It's somehow only just occurred to me how ruined we'll be if I fail to win the man on the other side of that door to our cause.<eos> No home.<eos> No cache.
You could own Woodes Rogers and see him imprisoned.<eos> Meanwhile, while Nassau smolders, her real property could be bought for a song.<eos> I bring you the chance, sir, to own the island, shape the regime that runs it, and do it all while seeing justice visited on your granddaughter's murderer.<eos> No.<eos> No to which part?
Meanwhile, while Nassau smolders, her real property could be bought for a song.<eos> I bring you the chance, sir, to own the island, shape the regime that runs it, and do it all while seeing justice visited on your granddaughter's murderer.<eos> No.<eos> No to which part?<eos> All of it.
I believe that.<eos> I trust it.<eos> Do you?<eos> I've heard you were with her.<eos> With Eleanor.
Are you free for lunch?<eos> No, I'm meeting my friend Adina, and a few other people.<eos> Nice.<eos> Is she part of your sorority?<eos> Black student union.
And I won't give that douche the satisfaction.<eos> - Hey, Regina?<eos> - Yes?<eos> Hook me up with a latte?<eos> What the hell?
Yeah, it's a good thing old DJ T.K. is making the big bucks so she can stay-at-home.<eos> I just want to give her a break this week.<eos> I remember how hard it is to be a stay-at-home mom.<eos> You know what, it's gonna be great for all of us to have that little ray of sunshine around.<eos> Especially for Daphne.
- Right here.<eos> In the living room.<eos> We didn't want to wait any longer and I've never wanted a big wedding anyway.<eos> And we're gonna have a chuppah with... because Lily is Jewish, of course.<eos> - Nothing fancy.
Now, I gotta go.<eos> See you later.<eos> Hi.<eos> I don't think we've officially met.<eos> - Luca Barahona.
He won't move against me.<eos> This will pass.<eos> And that's the end of this conversation.<eos> So many lies to deny a simple truth.<eos> What?
She needs for there to be a man in the governor's office, not Jack.<eos> A man of her choosing, and she wants me to be his wife.<eos> His wife?<eos> !<eos> In name only and for appearance's sake, nothing more.
His wife?<eos> !<eos> In name only and for appearance's sake, nothing more.<eos> The power would rest with us.<eos> Just for appearance?
Hey, the hold's on fire!<eos> What happened?<eos> Men in the water!<eos> Launches in the water!<eos> From the Eurydice!
You do this, and you're gonna regret it.<eos> No! Don't!<eos> Swim for the shore! Try to reach the shore!<eos> Get to the shore!<eos> Away from the ship!
I mean, pure fertilizer.<eos> Come on, Lito.<eos> This is good news.<eos> I mean, now we can go after another deal.<eos> A better deal.
Let's go.<eos> That's my man.<eos> Have you seen that?<eos> You there.<eos> Volume down.
Would you like to have a drink?<eos> - Sure.<eos> - Oh, yeah. He'll have a beer,<eos> - and I'll...<eos> - A beer?
Yeah. International money laundering.<eos> Big scale.<eos> Oh, you're good.<eos> How big?<eos> Billions.
Maybe we need to.<eos> Maybe that's what makes it bearable.<eos> What happened here?<eos> I had just got off the train... thought about getting on another... when I saw him.<eos> Who?
Maybe that's what makes it bearable.<eos> What happened here?<eos> I had just got off the train... thought about getting on another... when I saw him.<eos> Who?<eos> My father.
And that's exactly where I'm looking.<eos> There's a strong group of us inside BPO.<eos> We believe we can change the present direction of the organization back to the vision of Dr. El-Saadawi.<eos> What I want from you is time.<eos> And trust.
Hi.<eos> Why bathrooms?<eos> How are you?<eos> Fine.<eos> You?
How's it work?<eos> Same as everything else in the world.<eos> Figure out what you want and decide how far you're willing to go to get it.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Everything.
But surely the desire for justice lives in all of us.<eos> Few of us are willing to risk it just as you did last week.<eos> One of our reporters was in your matatu and captured this extraordinary event.<eos> Can we roll the tape?<eos> Van Damn! - Unbelievable.
Of course.<eos> But I don't understand what it means.<eos> Maybe you can explain it to me.<eos> That's Todd.<eos> One of Angelica's cluster.
I'm done with all of it.<eos> Angelica, be reasonable.<eos> I don't want to talk about it anymore.<eos> Where do you think you're going?<eos> Chicago.
I bring glad tidings.<eos> I have the solution... to your problem.<eos> Oh, which one?<eos> The one that brought you to Chateau Bug in the middle of the night.<eos> Bendix.
And nothing terrifies them like difference.<eos> You save your fucking justifications.<eos> You murdered an innocent girl.<eos> I know you killed Sara Patrell.<eos> Who?
- I have a meeting, yes.<eos> I don't know about the rest of you, but Kala and I are really beginning to love these family dinners.<eos> Best part of the week.<eos> - Sadly, we have to head home now.<eos> - Yeah. - Bye. - Good evening.
- Let me guess, the sensitive brother.<eos> - Lifelong bachelor.<eos> - But at least he doesn't die from AIDS.<eos> - So he does die.<eos> Drug overdose.
What the fuck?<eos> You know Lito Rodriguez?<eos> He's in my cluster.<eos> Lito Rodriguez... is one of the voices in your head?<eos> Bug!
Our generation's not allowed to have nice things.<eos> Time for another.<eos> Never thought I'd say this, but these make me miss the heroin.<eos> - God, I miss...<eos> - this.
Life on beta blockers... is no life at all.<eos> What?<eos> - We're not alone.<eos> - From last night?<eos> Aye, from last night.
If I had a good show, I'd always try and leave a little gift somewhere.<eos> - Like what?<eos> Money. Drugs. Music.<eos> Where did you get those?<eos> Train station.
I know you want to tell her to fuck off, but we need information.<eos> You use blockers.<eos> Everyone does.<eos> - Where do you get them from?<eos> - My contact.
You said we needed each other, but as soon as I ask you for something, you walk away.<eos> Be smart.<eos> - How long has he been after you?<eos> - A year.<eos> - A year?

Because he knew Jonas is connected to Whispers.<eos> He needs a watchdog.<eos> It's a painful irony, but my life is tied to Whispers.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - Goddamn it.
It's a nice round number.<eos> Zero.<eos> Zero.<eos> As in my future prospects.<eos> From hero to zero.
From hero to zero.<eos> Put that on my tombstone.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm practicing.<eos> For what?
Put that on my tombstone.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm practicing.<eos> For what?<eos> For my future as a homeless, unemployable failure.
Wow.<eos> When you get elected, I hope you don't forget about your friends.<eos> - You all right?<eos> - I used to feel so sure.<eos> Of what?
When you get elected, I hope you don't forget about your friends.<eos> - You all right?<eos> - I used to feel so sure.<eos> Of what?<eos> Of everything.
I have to take care of something first.<eos> We do this by the book.<eos> - Is he here? - He's...<eos> Then get this straight.<eos> None of your cowboy bullshit...
But it's okay, because without lies, life would be too hard.<eos> Without what lies?<eos> In the movie.<eos> Too many lies.<eos> From Here to Eternity.
From Here to Eternity.<eos> Why, "Uh-oh"?<eos> First, chocolate fudge brownie, and now this.<eos> What are we watching?<eos> From Here to Eternity. Ooh!
I'm not grieving a career.<eos> It was my dream. And now it's over.<eos> Every time I walk by this place, I remember that day.<eos> You were in the middle of the crowd. Everyone was like, "Van Damn!<eos> Van Damn!"
I hate being... controlled and forced to make deals and compromises I don't want to make.<eos> What are we gonna do?<eos> The killers could be anywhere.<eos> We need access to the restaurant computer.<eos> How without Nomi?
You will come to regret not dying tonight.<eos> Help me.<eos> Help me!<eos> Please!<eos> Help!
Thank you, dear.<eos> I'll be... I'll be right back.<eos> Okay, but, like, Teagan needs it this big.<eos> How are you holding up?<eos> Shaky.
What happened?<eos> - It's not good.<eos> When you say "not good," usually means stuff's going to start blowing up and people will start dying.<eos> Maybe it's time for me to leave this town.<eos> India plan.
I'll let you do your séance thing.<eos> I'll stay back here.<eos> They can make us normal...<eos> She was searching for her children.<eos> So much pain.
Who is Kit Wrangler?<eos> Academy Award-winning producer.<eos> Yes, of course Mr. Wrangler's in a meeting.<eos> I mean, "Daniela who?<eos> What, Mexico?
Open it up with Raj if you don't mind. It'll just mean more that way.<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> And once again, congratulations to you both.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Bye for now.
I thought about it a lot.<eos> I read the articles, both fact and fiction.<eos> I won't lie.<eos> It hurt.<eos> Especially the stuff about my sister.
That won't be necessary, Detective.<eos> I'll come with you.<eos> Cool.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Help!
Cops are shutting down the area.<eos> Oh, it's a road block.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Shit!<eos> Out of my way!
How many sensates are you connected to?<eos> Well, I'm not usually one to brag, but there's... Ow! Three-hundred-eighty-seven!<eos> Three-hundred-eighty-seven, I said.<eos> Oh, God! We need those connections.<eos> What for?
- Would you mind?<eos> - Mind? If Marc worked a little magic right now?<eos> No, no. Please. Please.<eos> Okay. Well, first of all, Jordi would never wear this.<eos> Not this.
Thank you, that's very kind.<eos> Hernando, Dani, please, don't embarrass the man.<eos> And you are?<eos> - She's my agent.<eos> - Oh. Daniela Velázquez.
But I will remind you... what you said to me when we were watching From Here to Eternity.<eos> That this wasn't a career you were chasing. It was a dream.<eos> So tell me, my love... if your dream isn't worth the risk, what is?<eos> Wait!<eos> From queer to eternity!
Performance.<eos> That's a loaded word.<eos> Scary.<eos> Lot of pressure.<eos> Not for me.
Ask yourselves...<eos> Are you?<eos> You have an amazing level of insight into how we hedgies think.<eos> Well, if I didn't after the time I put in...<eos> With Axe.
You got to know that.<eos> Plan ahead.<eos> Smart.<eos> Seasoned.<eos> Souses.
The cheat was very well executed.<eos> I was about to go across the table at him.<eos> To make sure he was banned from the park, to exact retribution.<eos> But then in an instant, I saw... this was the chance to re-frame my entire approach.<eos> So instead...
I need to deploy your specialized computing skills, can-do attitude, the magic of your tech nerdistry.<eos> No one's ever said I have a can-do attitude before.<eos> That's because you hide it behind a superior, dismissive, and pessimistic mask, but I see past all that.<eos> What do you need?<eos> Raya.
As soon as you get me onto Raya.<eos> Yes.<eos> Judge DeGiulio!<eos> Mr. Rhoades, sir.<eos> At your service, sir.
And I'm thinking, you know, I'm just about out of here.<eos> But... Then I become aware of a payment.<eos> A payment?<eos> That your wife received.<eos> From Axelrod.
And I'm not gonna let you ruin one of the first free nights I've had in years.<eos> I always knew I'd end up snared by Axelrod's money. It's poison.<eos> And you don't even need to ingest it for it to kill you.<eos> - Proximity is enough.<eos> - Well, good for you.
I love you!<eos> Hey, guys! Here I come!<eos> This place gave me my first real look at how the world worked.<eos> I watched people running toward the betting window with high hopes.<eos> No plan.
All right.<eos> Thank you so much for your support.<eos> It means a lot.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> Okay, yeah.
You know what?<eos> Get off my field right now! Get off!<eos> What are you looking at? Get back to work!<eos> Come on!<eos> What the hell?
No disagreement from here.<eos> Well, you know how the Republicans are.<eos> Anything but a decision. They mistake complaint for leadership.<eos> Well, instead of a committee to investigate you, you got one to discuss your declaration.<eos> All the way to election day.
-continues to operate in the shadows.<eos> I understand you believe in the importance of your article. And I agreed to come here today and talk with you about it.<eos> But we're fighting to keep this country safe.<eos> Mrs. Underwood, the White House has yet to release one piece of information about the attempted capture of those domestic terrorists.<eos> ICO terrorists, yes.
So she's not condoning it, but it is sympathetic.<eos> Plays into the idea that Joshua and Zachary were just a pair of troubled kids looking for a cause, no different than some school shooter.<eos> The post has been shared over 100,000 times.<eos> I want to talk with her.<eos> -Hannah?
Tom is waiting for me.<eos> Well, you go on.<eos> I shouldn't have cried at the funeral.<eos> -No, it played beautifully.<eos> -Not for me.
Very compelling.<eos> What did you really think?<eos> It was almost like the real thing.<eos> The NSA has good people. Very good.<eos> -Too good.
What did you really think?<eos> It was almost like the real thing.<eos> The NSA has good people. Very good.<eos> -Too good.<eos> -Not as good as you.
The FBI is currently gathering a list of words and images.<eos> If they appear on your children's or your coworkers' devices, please--<eos> War whore!<eos> - Move!<eos> - Car!
- Tongue in the ear? No?<eos> - No, I don't...<eos> Fuck you.<eos> - You okay to drive?<eos> - A-okay.
As long as you don't get in his way, he's got no reason to hurt you or your family.<eos> I hope you get in the safe.<eos> You are guaranteeing me ten, even if it's like Al Capone's vault.<eos> If it's empty, how am I gonna get you $10,000?<eos> The next safe.
All right.<eos> I wait for Grandma to go out on her daily rounds.<eos> I walk in.<eos> I ask Grandpa for a bond for...<eos> - For Preston James Collins III.
Turns out social work was more my speed.<eos> The important thing is we're on the same side.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> And what side is that?<eos> Law enforcement?
Morning, sir.<eos> Morse.<eos> A body's come up below Magdalen Bridge.<eos> The clothes match the description of a... missing person from a month ago.<eos> Professor Neilsen from Lovelace College.
- I'll leave you something to warm through. - Right.<eos> I should hear about my Sergeant's exam today.<eos> Results are out.<eos> - You'll be off, then. - Well, no.<eos> Not altogether.
He'll have had his reasons, I expect.<eos> Love's very popular.<eos> The want of it. A broken heart.<eos> Where do you stand with all that?<eos> Suicide?
Love's very popular.<eos> The want of it. A broken heart.<eos> Where do you stand with all that?<eos> Suicide?<eos> Love.
You have to catch the person who killed Richard Nielsen.<eos> His last letter he sent, he said there were problems within his group.<eos> What kind of problems?<eos> He didn't say, but you should know our opinions were simpatico upon certain important matters.<eos> - Such as?
We're no closer to catching this bastard, and now the whole world knows about it.<eos> We'll have every nutcase and lunatic in Oxford to claim responsibility and no way to sort the wheat from the chaff.<eos> Tessa! Come here.<eos> This story, where did you get it?<eos> Straight from the horse's mouth.
You've no family local. As I understand it, there's nothing to keep you here.<eos> Scotch before lunch?<eos> I thought you said it gave you guts-ache?<eos> How did you leave it?<eos> One step forward.
Did you ever go with him, out to Binsey?<eos> Once or twice.<eos> Did you know his kids? He had a son and daughter.<eos> I remember a little girl, vaguely.<eos> What about the boy? Alexander?
Message for Morse from Dorothea Frazil.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Alexander Leighton-Asbury went to live with his maternal grandparents, name of King, in Dundee.<eos> She has further information at the Oxford Mail. - Over.<eos> - Out.
A birth registered in the second quarter of 1939.<eos> Penelope. Perhaps we should try the swimming baths.<eos> Maybe he's taken her there.<eos> Tessa Knight's coat did reek of chlorine.<eos> Out.
He must know we've found the house in Binsey.<eos> What about the boat house where his sister drowned?<eos> - So,what's his motive?<eos> - Miss Palfrey he knew as a child.<eos> Same as Edison Smalls.
Um... purpose?<eos> I grew up watching my mom dedicate her life to being a mother and a wife to a naval officer, and I, uh-- it was important to me that my kids see me as more than that.<eos> Navy, huh?<eos> Didn't know that.<eos> "Not self but country."
Who's walking out on who?<eos> See you around... partner.<eos> Appreciate that. I hope you have good news.<eos> We brought in our VIP.<eos> Which one?
- Yeah, beat it.<eos> Two minutes.<eos> - Mom.<eos> - Bram.<eos> No contact.
Hold up.<eos> You know, if you're gonna, like, go and take over, you might wanna do it right.<eos> I guess.<eos> Have fun storming the castle!<eos> What... what castle?
Did you do this?<eos> No, but...<eos> Yo, his skin be going all gray like he's cloudy and overcast.<eos> Please.<eos> For you.
No, but...<eos> Yo, his skin be going all gray like he's cloudy and overcast.<eos> Please.<eos> For you.<eos> Not for him.
- Nope.<eos> - Which wire am I supposed to cut?<eos> Hmm... the blue one.<eos> You're full of shit.<eos> - Shit.
Competitive table setting?<eos> Tablescape. It's called tablescape.<eos> - Oh, hello. We're in here.<eos> You know if the phone works?<eos> Oh! Merry Christmas.
But the Pilgrim capsule is damaged.<eos> At 0630 UTC, Pilgrim was struck by debris and veered off course.<eos> Rory Adams will spacewalk to establish visual contact with the incoming space capsule, and he will grab it with a remote arm.<eos> We've been waiting a long time for this sample, and Rory is placing himself at great risk to secure it.<eos> Over and out. DAVID:
His heart rate is at 165.<eos> - Sho, can we trust the glove?<eos> - It's very tight. RORY:<eos> Glove's not going anywhere. It's fine.<eos> Shit.
The liquid, it's blocking my vision.<eos> I don't have time.<eos> I've got to jump.<eos> - SHO: Kat, the tether won't reach. - I'm unclipping.<eos> Kat? - No comments!
You comfortable?<eos> What happened?<eos> I've been asking myself the same question.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Woz.
What happened?<eos> I've been asking myself the same question.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Woz.<eos> Woz.
Victim is down.<eos> Woz, listen to me.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Woz!
My dad used to say, "Beat your kid every day.<eos> If you don't know the reason why, they will."<eos> So you're settling a score?<eos> I'm providing a service.<eos> Wow.
- Agreed.<eos> Okay, good.<eos> Now let's get started.<eos> What's your name?<eos> Harlee.
It's no problem.<eos> I, um...<eos> I better get going and, uh, find some babies to kiss or something.<eos> Home safe.<eos> Safe tomorrow.
Because you're the former animal.<eos> Nobody understands mysterious animal situations like you do.<eos> I'm done with mysterious animal situations.<eos> I want mysterious men.<eos> French ones.
Why were there rats in a classroom?<eos> Uh, they ran in during second period, uh, about 50 of them.<eos> Your two minutes are up.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Paris.
"Loyalty, courage, integrity."<eos> These are the qualities we expect of all our interns, the qualities we demand of you during your 6 months with us.<eos> Loyalty, courage, integrity.<eos> You'll join actual Federal Agents as we investigate everything from white-collar crime to terrorism...<eos> International and domestic?
International and domestic?<eos> Uh, yes, exactly.<eos> We're also part of task forces to catch kidnappers, murderers...<eos> Serial killers?<eos> Yes, even serial killers.
We thought that She was leading us to Her.<eos> - We summoned Her.<eos> - You know, I actually believed Our Lady Underground chose me.<eos> You may address me as Reynard the Fox,<eos> Trickster of the faithful, the pure of heart, the very stupid. Hi, Martin.
- You know how to fuck up their shit.<eos> - No. - I want to make a deal.<eos> - Let's.<eos> ♪ We learned how ♪<eos> Help!
I knew The Beast came here every day, but is it... but is it even possible for him to drain the Wellspring that much?<eos> He really threw something out of whack.<eos> I vote we don't touch it on the grounds that exploding Fillory wouldn't help.<eos> Okay. We need a new plan.<eos> - What plan?
Okay. We need a new plan.<eos> - What plan?<eos> - The Beast is gone.<eos> Our squad is a joke.<eos> What plan, exactly?
- Okay.<eos> - Whitespire it is.<eos> Come on, everybody.<eos> Grab snacks.<eos> Yeah, uh, about that.
Go on.<eos> Go. Go, go.<eos> You know, you're very beautiful.<eos> Where are you from, hmm?<eos> Earth?
I will ask you a series of questions designed to root out all pretenders to the throne.<eos> Only a true High King will hold the answers in his heart.<eos> Come at me.<eos> What popular American television program stars actor Tim Daly?<eos> What the fuck?
- Yes, Mrs. Mukherjee.<eos> 'Okay, Rohan.'<eos> - Thank you.<eos> I'll see you.<eos> Bye. - 'Bye.'
Can you please help me?<eos> He..<eos> - I'm sorry, ma'am, but there's no one here.<eos> Can you please ask the security?<eos> Security?
No?<eos> Tell me, please.<eos> You're scaring me, now.<eos> Where are we going?<eos> Home.
You're scaring me, now.<eos> Where are we going?<eos> Home.<eos> - What?<eos> Our new home.
Perfect.<eos> - Isn't it?<eos> And many candles!<eos> - Candles?<eos> Yes, the scented kind.
While we are mere butchers.<eos> We make a living by butchery, son!<eos> You must work with me at my shop from tomorrow.<eos> I will.<eos> - No excuses!
But now..<eos> Now, everything will be fine, Su.<eos> We will be just like we were.<eos> You and..<eos> S-Su!
I need to send him to Delhi.<eos> The people in the neighbourhood will forget all this, soon.<eos> You should too.<eos> Delete this from your memory.<eos> Goodbye.
'But if, what happened today, happened often' 'you would have shattered' 'and I would not be able to tolerate it.'<eos> 'When you left for work today, I was cooking.'<eos> 'Who is it?<eos> '<eos> 'Percy.'
- Good.'<eos> 'And don't worry about the glass, I'll clean it up.'<eos> 'Ma'am, have you made 'Parathas'?<eos> '<eos> 'Yes, of potatoes!
Hey!<eos> - Mr. Chaube!<eos> Get out.<eos> I asked you to leave!<eos> Enough of this!
Get out.<eos> I asked you to leave!<eos> Enough of this!<eos> Out!<eos> Nalavde.
Besides..<eos> I have no hopes from you, neither does Su.<eos> I was here to tell you that had your system helped us a little bit I wouldn't have to do anything.<eos> But now, I will have to..<eos> For my Su.
Tell me, sir.<eos> What do I have to do?<eos> Well..<eos> You arrest people for a couple of days..<eos> During festivals..
I'm here.<eos> Come and meet me later.<eos> - Yes, I'll come, sir.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Goodbye.
- Yes, I'll come, sir.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Bye.
So what if you're my friend's son?<eos> I'll kill you.<eos> This advertisement should reach every house by tomorrow.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> - Each and every house.
Tear off the FIR.<eos> I'll find out what's going on between Amit and the butcher.<eos> Send Wasim to me.<eos> So, should I release him?<eos> - Who?
I want to clear everything with you personally.<eos> Where?<eos> Amit.<eos> - Hey!<eos> Wasim!
- Hey!<eos> Wasim!<eos> Come..<eos> I've brought you the best whiskey today.<eos> Scotch!
Come here and meet me.<eos> I hope you know where you have to come.<eos> I'll know only if you tell me.<eos> The warehouse where you kept that blind woman.<eos> In that warehouse?
What if your dad finds out someday?<eos> Both of us will be..<eos> Nothing will happen.<eos> Please.<eos> For the sake of our colony's honour.
Amit and Wasim.<eos> You asked me a question.<eos> How did you kill them?<eos> Wasim?<eos> Amit?
How did you kill them?<eos> Wasim?<eos> Amit?<eos> No.<eos> Shelar.
Zaffar.<eos> - Yes, Rohan.<eos> - Listen.<eos> I need Percy, Sakharam and you.<eos> Sakharam?
- Yes, Rohan.<eos> - Listen.<eos> I need Percy, Sakharam and you.<eos> Sakharam?<eos> Who?
But it will look like suicide.<eos> Amit killed Wasim, and Shelar killed Amit.<eos> In the guilt of killing his brother<eos> Shelar committed suicide.<eos> Wow!
"Am I watching this or reading it?" You know?<eos> Yeah, I don't have the patience to get through most movies.<eos> I guess I'm more of a doer.<eos> What is it you're always doing, Sam?<eos> Real estate.
- Until then, just relax.<eos> For God's sake, try not to piss a anybody else off.<eos> - I'll do my best.<eos> - All right.<eos> Good-bye.
Yeah, you're not kidding.<eos> And I don't... I don't think he likes me that much anymore.<eos> It makes the job a lot harder.<eos> I'm like, "What the hell am I doing this for?"<eos> "Personal satisfaction?"
I think that's enough.<eos> - More drinks.<eos> - No, this is getting...<eos> He's lost his mind.<eos> So, where to... The past or the future?
- More drinks.<eos> - No, this is getting...<eos> He's lost his mind.<eos> So, where to... The past or the future?<eos> Well, the future, or course, away from all you cynics.
Look, I can appreciate this on some level, but no.<eos> You will not be getting arrested today.<eos> There will be no free press, despite the fact I like you better than the other guy.<eos> What other guy?<eos> Your friend?
He couldn't explain it, either.<eos> Ms. Walker?<eos> Doug Lawson, head of security for Anders Enterprises.<eos> I understand there was a breach in the Wells Exhibit today?<eos> Not exactly a breach, no.
Tell me, how did you muster the courage to find me?<eos> I'm not here to engage in idle banter, John.<eos> We must be off.<eos> And where are we going?<eos> To the time machine.
You're lucky you just suffered a slight concussion is all.<eos> I'll let the doctor know you're awake, and you have a friend on the way.<eos> A friend?<eos> What friend?<eos> No wallet, no I.D.
Then do it.<eos> Do it.<eos> Do it!<eos> Over here!<eos> Help!
You can Google it, in fact.<eos> So, this little power struggle will not yield you anything.<eos> I never return to London.<eos> Well, maybe it's because you die.<eos> By your cowardly hands?
Your utopia.<eos> And I couldn't have been more wrong.<eos> My parents died when I was a little girl.<eos> They were all I had.<eos> No siblings, no extended family.
I'm just happy you're here.<eos> Get some rest.<eos> It's been a long day.<eos> Thank you, Vanessa, for your kindness.<eos> Good night.
You got to start calling me Jane.<eos> Right.<eos> Very well.<eos> I'll start tomorrow.<eos> Until then.
All better.<eos> Everything's right as rain now.<eos> why did you come here, Caleb?<eos> - I came here because...<eos> Dylan and Emma.
That's not my role here.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - I don't feel that I have the authority to act in that manner.<eos> This is between you and Norma, and what happens to you now, it's up to Norma, and I'm just an observer.<eos> - Norman.
- What was it like when you two were children?<eos> - She was...<eos> Our mom was crazy.<eos> You know, she would get depressed, lock us in a room for a day, two.<eos> And no food.
- She was...<eos> Our mom was crazy.<eos> You know, she would get depressed, lock us in a room for a day, two.<eos> And no food.<eos> No bathroom.
you're gonna be happy again, Norman.<eos> I promise you that.<eos> The woods will always be out there, okay?<eos> But you've got to do this. Now.<eos> For me, okay?
One of ours?<eos> I really hope not.<eos> But I am hoping that if he's on anyone's radar, it's Langley's.<eos> Might take a few hours.<eos> - Asha, hey.
'Cause this bastard's no use to us dead.<eos> We need to take him alive.<eos> I'm ready.<eos> How we gonna take him?<eos> Alive.
Davis is heading west on Pine.<eos> He can't keep going on like this for long.<eos> When he runs out of gas, he's gonna need an escape vehicle.<eos> There's a parking structure on 32nd,<eos> - right next to a freeway on-ramp.
- You can't do this.<eos> - Do what?<eos> Where are we?<eos> On a boat.<eos> Ship.
- Still waiting for a statement.<eos> - And the surviving gunman?<eos> - Refusing to talk without a lawyer.<eos> What, no outbursts?<eos> No delusional rants?
- And now you know.<eos> - And tomorrow?<eos> - What about it?<eos> And the next day?<eos> And the next day?
Knowing what we now know from the surviving gunmen?<eos> - Which is?<eos> - I already covered that.<eos> One more time.<eos> Just for me.
That's... creative.<eos> Oh, damn it.<eos> Oh, damn it. Aah!<eos> Damn it!<eos> Oh, Hodgins, hey, hey, hey.
Dr. Hodgins?<eos> You're only now noticing he's not here, aren't you?<eos> We couldn't stop him from going.<eos> Zack, I've brought you some visitors.<eos> Hodgins.
- So no admission of guilt?<eos> - No.<eos> He's been nothing but professional.<eos> Calm, collected; all Dr. Jekyll.<eos> No sign of Mr. Hyde.
I need- - What was I doing before the explosion?<eos> I think you were in your office.<eos> - What are we working on?<eos> - We're working on<eos> Fred Walden's remains.
Move through it.<eos> Man, are you kidding me?<eos> Whoa. Oh. The blast emptied out all the bone storage drawers.<eos> It appears I'll need Dr. Vaziri's help.<eos> Not just Arastoo.
I don't see anything, either.<eos> Maybe the polygraph will show us something different.<eos> What do you got?<eos> She passed.<eos> Not even a gray area.
Hodgins is right.<eos> We need to channel everything Dr. Brennan has ever taught us.<eos> Okay, so let's assume that Dr. Brennan wrote that note because she noticed the anomaly in the bones' weight.<eos> What if the bone loss was due to some kind of malformation<eos> - as a child?
Community recreation is just as important.<eos> Sister Ursula says I need to spend more time on my studies.<eos> The difficulty with television is that it kills the conversation in the room so completely.<eos> Without that cumbersome device to distract us, we can take greater pleasure in our handicrafts.<eos> And in one another's company.
You're good at that, aren't you? Not leaving marks on people, Lester.<eos> I never know whether it's cos you're clever, or cos you're just a coward.<eos> Coward?<eos> Cowards don't do this, do they?<eos> Or this.
I never know whether it's cos you're clever, or cos you're just a coward.<eos> Coward?<eos> Cowards don't do this, do they?<eos> Or this.<eos> Or this!
Help! Help!<eos> [Help me!<eos> Help my mummy! ]<eos> Hurry!<eos> Help!
For being brusque and not telling you why.<eos> And for something else which may never happen, but if it does... .. it's going to hurt us both so much.<eos> What?<eos> I've had a letter from Hong Kong.<eos> - From your father?
And for something else which may never happen, but if it does... .. it's going to hurt us both so much.<eos> What?<eos> I've had a letter from Hong Kong.<eos> - From your father?<eos> - From his nurse.
I'm camping in front of the BSU and refusing to eat.<eos> All I can really offer is my support.<eos> Regina: Luca and I are together.<eos> Oh.<eos> Wow.
It's only my favorite day of the whole damn year.<eos> - The Kangaroo Krawl?<eos> - It's an all-day pub crawl.<eos> We go to the best 12 bars, drink two beers at each one all in the name of school spirit.<eos> Totally unsanctioned, of course.
- You really think you're ready?<eos> - I know I'm ready.<eos> Okay.<eos> Congratulations, you've got one.<eos> Wow.
Can they...<eos> Hey! What are you doing?<eos> I'm watching that.<eos> I've got something better for you to look at.<eos> Wow.
Wow.<eos> You don't think I was gonna let our date night end with you falling asleep on the couch?<eos> Ooh.<eos> Well, you know, I...<eos> Wow. (chuckles)
I checked his I.D.<eos> You know how easy it is to get a fake I.D.?<eos> Actually, yes, I do.<eos> Sir, it's her first day.<eos> Good for her.
- I'll text you the name of it.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> That's great.<eos> No problem.<eos> And Luca?
- See you. - Later, Bay.<eos> Can I ask you something?<eos> What's up?<eos> Some of us from the BSU are getting together to ask Dean Peterson to address some concerns about how we're being treated on campus.<eos> Nah. Not for me.
Get off me!<eos> Stop resisting!<eos> Stop resisting!<eos> Get off me!<eos> Help!
Did you hear?<eos> They're sitting out!<eos> - All of them!<eos> - Who?<eos> Uh, lacrosse, uh, soccer, volleyball!
Awesome!<eos> I mean, not that I know how to use any of this, but thankfully my roomie does.<eos> That is to die for.<eos> A new dish on the menu.<eos> - Bucatini All'Regina. - Aww...
I wanted to do the same thing, but my mom's organs weren't healthy.<eos> Did you say that your mom died?<eos> Pancreatic cancer.<eos> She never stopped fighting.<eos> For either of us.
So, you've never thought about meeting any of them?<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> How come?<eos> Because I... don't like to think about that day.<eos> That decision.
Kathryn, is that what you think?<eos> I see it as more symbolic.<eos> Right, Reverend?<eos> It is that as well, and a reminder that we are immersed in the Father's love for us through Jesus Christ.<eos> "Father".
You know what I think?<eos> I think you mixed it up with Ian and you ended up killing him, that's what I think.<eos> That's ridiculous.<eos> If one of my employees struck me on the skull, I'd have fired him on the spot.<eos> Please.
You're kiddin' me, huh? Geez.<eos> Get off my partner.<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> Thanks for showing up, Aubrey.<eos> Anytime.
Both the wrists and elbows show a remarkable number of hairline fractures.<eos> That is not surprising, as shoulder dislocation is a common feature of bodies that have been dragged for any distance.<eos> True, but based on the tearing wounds to the synovial membranes, it looks more like someone tried to rip his arms from his sockets.<eos> No human is capable of inflicting<eos> - this amount of damage.
I applaud their curious minds.<eos> Plus, their intervention did save the body from being completely dissolved. - See?<eos> - Zip it.<eos> Okay, Aubrey, whose side are you on anyways?<eos> Hers. Sorry, but in this instance,
Why would you even ask that?<eos> Well, black kale is high in vitamin K and antioxidants, both of which promote healing.<eos> Okay.<eos> No.<eos> No lesions, okay?
It looks like this was issued this morning.<eos> He was last seen at the retirement center where he lived.<eos> Given his age at time of death, it's surprising how little the FBI has on file concerning our victim.<eos> Which means he's probably a pretty decent guy. No felonies.<eos> No misdemeanors.
Which is why I want you to get a vasectomy. What?<eos> Vasectomy.<eos> It's a surgical procedure where the vas deferens is severed and then tied. No.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> No severing.
Dr. Temperance Brennan.<eos> You're here because of the guy that was killed, right?<eos> Uh, did you know him?<eos> Uh, no. No.<eos> What about Rufus Tucker?
Yeah?<eos> I think I found something.<eos> Please tell me it's blood this time. It is.<eos> However, based on the smear pattern, it appears the killer used multiple cleaning agents.<eos> Possibly as many as four.
So you didn't see or hear anything?<eos> All I know is, the last few weeks he spent a whole lot of time at night in the computer lab.<eos> Okay.<eos> Don't ask me what he was doing on the computer. All he said was, better I didn't know.<eos> Hey, Hodgins,
But he wasn't destitute or anything, I-I did help him out from time to time.<eos> Groceries and whatnot.<eos> Did he have any outstanding debts?<eos> Well, what do you mean?<eos> Like to a bookie?
There are no calluses on the victim's metacarpals.<eos> Which there most definitely would be had he actually boxed.<eos> What about the metatarsals?<eos> Did you find any remodeled march fractures?<eos> No, no stress fractures at all.
How could he just watch Aldo get taken and not try to help?<eos> I don't know, but Booth believes he's telling the truth.<eos> Did McKinney see anything that we can use?<eos> Nothing specific.<eos> No plate numbers, no physical characteristics.
But what happens when there's more than one equal choice?<eos> Yeah, well... it gets less and less useful.<eos> This is now out of control. Well, at least it gives us a general direction.<eos> Hey, I swabbed the perimortem striations on the ribs.<eos> The rat bites? Mm-hmm.
No, Booth saw Jerry Cans of gas.<eos> My hunch is it was powered by a petroleum gel.<eos> It sticks to everything and burns at over 2,000 degrees.<eos> Which means there won't be much left.<eos> Close to zilch.
What about Psycho Sue?<eos> Psycho Sue?<eos> That's what some of the kids call Jacob's mother, Sue Casey.<eos> She's passionate but harmless.<eos> Harmless?
You, uh, you need any help?<eos> Uh, sure.<eos> I'm just starting in on Austin's client files from the tutoring company.<eos> Grab a few.<eos> Totes.
It must have been pretty stressful losing all those clients to Austin.<eos> Please.<eos> Money is not an issue.<eos> I do this job for the networking.<eos> Networking?
Okay, so that means someone much older than him had their hands down his pants.<eos> Oh, well, that explains it.<eos> Explains what?<eos> Why mothers prefer...<eos> Austin's services over Matt's.
I am a contemptible fool for trusting her.<eos> Tell me, what is it about my novels that you find so objectionable?<eos> I don't know that I should speak frankly here.<eos> But... from what little I've read, I find them to be cheap and lacking a certain perspicacity.<eos> Perspicacity?
Perhaps I was a bit too harsh.<eos> I assure you, my skin is quite thick, in the metaphorical sense.<eos> However, the word choice triggered a memory.<eos> Years ago, my editor sent me stories written by readers in the style of my books-- fan fiction.<eos> Oh, fan fiction. Yeah.
Well, it's in the original short story, which I've already read her.<eos> What?<eos> Okay. Don't judge me, Booth.<eos> When I described the pecking out of the eyes, I did so in a tasteful manner.<eos> Tasteful?
He's still after me!<eos> He's still after me!<eos> No, no, no! Help!<eos> He's still coming!<eos> Darla?
- Whoa! -00 a.m.<eos> I... really. It's that late?<eos> I should help the kiddos, you know, tie their shoes.<eos> I-I'll help, too.<eos> No! Good luck with that.
There was no I.D.<eos> But based on height and weight, he matches the description.<eos> Check his left arm.<eos> Okay. Where?<eos> Right below his shoulder.
Check his left arm.<eos> Okay. Where?<eos> Right below his shoulder.<eos> "Sua Sponte." Latin.<eos> "Of their own accord."
Margaret's torture appears to have been an effort to obtain information.<eos> Once the killer had it, he quickly ended her life.<eos> Troponin enzyme levels and elevated stress hormones in Mike's blood indicate he died of cardiac arrest.<eos> So then, why keep torturing Mike if he already told the killer everything he knew?<eos> For the pleasure of it.
But how am I gonna find a judge who isn't going to demand probable cause?<eos> Caroline, please.<eos> My partner needs this.<eos> I'll do what I can.<eos> But no promises.
All components of a maintenance IV.<eos> Mike was being kept alive to extend the torture.<eos> Why did both of you come here to give me this information?<eos> We wanted to see how you were.<eos> Not well.
To see the look on my face when they tell me my children are dead.<eos> That's crazy.<eos> Really?<eos> Because it says here that General Josip Radik was shot at long range during his son's sixth birthday.<eos> September 15, 1995.
Oh, this is gnarly.<eos> Yes. That is definitely a keeper.<eos> Yeah, imagine the look on the Coop's face when he opens his car and all these guts spill out.<eos> Dude, what do you think this is from?<eos> Uh, mountain lion, probably.
She was... a little wobbly at first, and then I just kind of let her go and then, bam-- hit the ground.<eos> Booth, I-I don't want Christine riding a bicycle until I can properly teach her about the physics.<eos> What physics?<eos> What are you talking about, huh?<eos> Physics.
You think I killed Phyllis?<eos> Why would I kill her?<eos> We were training partners.<eos> She was giving me all her secrets.<eos> What secrets?
The flapjack guy even sold special pancakes just to throw at her.<eos> Cam said that the killer's hands were covered in shortening.<eos> Gene, did the flapjack guy have anything against Phyllis?<eos> Yeah, they had a... hilarious feud going on.<eos> What kind of feud?
It might lead someone to murder.<eos> I didn't kill her.<eos> I just found out about it this morning.<eos> This morning?<eos> From whom?
So if the chain saw snapped...<eos> Then the killer must have a similar injury to Rodolfo.<eos> It's not an injury.<eos> Good work, Dr. Fuentes.<eos> Any time.
Do these caribou have migration patterns?<eos> They do, yeah.<eos> Also, the lichen can be found in varying concentrations around the island.<eos> The animal bone we found with the victim. It's a needle... for nalebinding.<eos> Uh, Nal-what?
Booth.<eos> What do you got?<eos> Results from the victim's chest wound.<eos> Minute traces of carbon-reinforced polymer and, apparently, venison jerky.<eos> Jerky?
What's that?<eos> Oh, my one and only attempt to sound like a Newfie.<eos> Not bad.<eos> Though you should probably know the term Newfie's considered offense coming from a C.F.A.<eos> Non-native.
Okay. What's this about?<eos> I've already submitted for permits.<eos> Mr. Hitchcock, this is FBI Special Agent Booth.<eos> Look, did you know Sarah Abbott?<eos> Who?
'Cause that's the results that you wanted from the fractures.<eos> Let's take a look here.<eos> These look like the injuries were all made by rocks, coastal ones.<eos> She must have fallen.<eos> Probably from quite a height.
I've been a hunting guide on the island for over 40 years.<eos> Where you visiting from?<eos> D.C.- - FBI Special Agent James Aubrey.<eos> We're here about a murder, Rick.<eos> A young woman.
That name ring a bell?<eos> Yeah, rich guy.<eos> I took him out, oh, about a week and a half ago.<eos> Does he use a gun or a bow?<eos> Bow.
If I was actually trying to shoot you, I wouldn't have missed.<eos> I was just trying to scare you.<eos> Why?<eos> I thought you worked for that Adam guy.<eos> Adam Hitchcock?
Just-Just-Just, please, pull it up right here.<eos> Oh, okay. One sec.<eos> Okay, here.<eos> Leave it up on the screen.<eos> Hodgins!
Okay, here.<eos> Leave it up on the screen.<eos> Hodgins!<eos> What?<eos> Hodgins!
His hearing is in two weeks.<eos> You and Cam threw out the only evidence we have that would exonerate him.<eos> Well, we threw it out because your evidence was suspect.<eos> Do you really think that I would falsify my work?<eos> For a friend... yes.
Yeah, well, I might have something.<eos> I got the results from the victim's tox screen.<eos> No drugs, no alcohol, but his blood - did test positive for saline.<eos> - Saline?<eos> Like contact solution?
You know what I think?<eos> I think that something went wrong at your last heist.<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> Heist?
What's going on?<eos> Oh, my God! Gordy, what's going on?<eos> Is everything all right?<eos> It just fell from the sky like some damn bird or something!<eos> Gordy?
Oh, my God! Gordy, what's going on?<eos> Is everything all right?<eos> It just fell from the sky like some damn bird or something!<eos> Gordy?<eos> Gordy?
Is everything all right?<eos> It just fell from the sky like some damn bird or something!<eos> Gordy?<eos> Gordy?<eos> Gordy?
Oh, heavens no.<eos> I woke up one morning and... just found the passion was missing.<eos> Well, if you're not working anymore, why are you wearing your Jeffersonian badge?<eos> I'm studying prairie dogs with the zoology department.<eos> Prairie dogs?
Ronny wrote himself a story, took a leave of absence from work and went off to make his movie.<eos> Huh. This movie was all Ronny could think about.<eos> It was going to be his Citizen Crane.<eos> - So I've been going through the burnt blobs... - Whoa! ...that used to be our victim's shoes.<eos> Geez, Hodgins.
But trust me, I didn't kill Ron to take control of his movie.<eos> Why should we believe you?<eos> 'Cause he was already giving me plenty of control.<eos> When was the last time you saw Ron?<eos> Last night.
Sure. Yeah. I can also give you some of the stuff I shot today.<eos> I got this great shot of a disembodied arm's P.O.V.<eos> No. We're good.<eos> Thank you, bye.<eos> Killer Klowns from Outer Space?
All of them involving giant man-eating bugs.<eos> I can't tell you how many times I've suffered through Earwig Armageddon.<eos> Have you swabbed the injuries on the victim's arm?<eos> I have, and I found, uh, traces of keratin in the wounds.<eos> Like, from a fingernail?
It was made of polyurethane resin.<eos> Wait, a fake panther claw?<eos> A party panther claw.<eos> So, we're gonna need to test everyone in the panther suits used in the movie.<eos> Or just one.
Which one of the actors wore the orange panther suit?<eos> Why don't I show you?<eos> Why don't you just tell me?<eos> I think it'll have a bigger impact...<eos> Hodgins, just...
So in addition to landscaping, white marble chips are occasionally used as surface material on roofs.<eos> And one of those roofs is on Snoozeland.<eos> Do we know how tall this building is?<eos> Yeah, according to the calculations, the building is 23 feet tall.<eos> Roughly two stories.
Yeah.<eos> Is it cool if I still come over for the game tomorrow night?<eos> Yes, yes.<eos> I'm making my famous puttanesca.<eos> On-on game night?
Could I have everybody's attention, please?<eos> To the bride and groom.<eos> Whoa, whoa, wait, wait. One more time, I missed it there, Clark.<eos> For Hodgins.
Wait, wait, wait. Whoa, whoa. Whoa!<eos> Careful, Dr. Saroyan. Don't hurt yourself.<eos> Or anyone else.<eos> Don't forget, I am still technically your boss, Clark.<eos> At least until next week.

One Arast-ini, gorgeous.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What a gentleman, getting a drink for that pretty little redhead of yours.<eos> Oh. Actually, uh, these are both for me.<eos> Wow. Anxious about the big move?
Yeah, yes, something like that.<eos> To us.<eos> To friendship.<eos> Mm, these are much too strong.<eos> Not for me.
At least a thousand times more powerful.<eos> To us.<eos> To friendship.<eos> Mm, these are much too strong.<eos> Not for me.
I understand that, but look at the cards that I drew, Bones.<eos> You are in danger.<eos> All right.<eos> Oh, Agent Booth.<eos> - Hey, Avalon.
My ID was in my purse, and now I'm not seeing it. It must've slipped out.<eos> It might not be the best time to leave with...<eos> Wait, whoa, whoa, wait a second.<eos> What do you mean your ID's missing?<eos> My, uh, Jeffersonian security pass.
He could've gotten to her.<eos> She could've changed her mind.<eos> Come on.<eos> With projections for Texas and Virginia now clear, this entire election has come down to one state...<eos> California.
Like a slanket.<eos> Secretary of state said we're up by 2,000 votes.<eos> What are you hearing?<eos> 2,000?<eos> Wow.
Secretary of state said we're up by 2,000 votes.<eos> What are you hearing?<eos> 2,000?<eos> Wow.<eos> "Wow"?
Loud!<eos> BNC is now ready to call San Benito county and the state of California, and...<eos> This is a surprise.<eos> BNC is projecting that governor Frankie Vargas will carry San Benito county... And the state of California to become the next President of the United States.<eos> Wow.
You ran a great campaign.<eos> I believe it is time that we unite the country...<eos> And I am ready to support you in any way I can.<eos> God bless you and this great country.<eos> Goodbye.
Can you believe?<eos> Vice President Beene.<eos> Vice President Beeeeene.<eos> It's like having a vampire a heartbeat away from the oval.<eos> Blood-sucker.
Nelson Mcclintock.<eos> Prints on the sniper rifle look to be his.<eos> We're testing.<eos> Are we sure he's not part of a terrorist cell?<eos> Dana?
I want to see only doctors and nurses, Agents, me, and you.<eos> That's it.<eos> I want everyone else off this floor.<eos> And let's toss a net on all cell service, wifi, land lines and cable.<eos> No communications in or out.
- Charlie? I'm just saying...<eos> Caribbean awaits, Robin.<eos> We got to get a move on.<eos> Look, you think you can get in, huck, to the tip line?<eos> Easy.
You can just walk away.<eos> That's nice.<eos> Fitz...<eos> I want it.<eos> The crown, the rare air...
- was shot in Fairmount Park...<eos> - You'll see behind me that a massive candlelight vigil is under way, the number of people growing by the minute... No appearance yet by Cyrus Beene or by the hospital staff, who remain tight-lipped about President-elect Vargas' condition...<eos> All we can do now is pray.<eos> We went through all 832 voicemails on the FBI tip line.<eos> No leads.
Then you know what you have to do.<eos> Frankie Vargas was a good man.<eos> Honorable.<eos> His family's loss is the country's loss.<eos> And yours.
- But I believe you're an actress. - Ah.<eos> Enjoy it.<eos> - Thank you very much.<eos> Bravo.<eos> Anytime.
You're not still sleeping, are you?<eos> - What time is it?<eos> - 10:00 a.m.<eos> Listen, you better start doing whatever actor-y shit it is you need to do to get ready because you've only got two hours.<eos> Until what?
Maximum security prison.<eos> That was amazing.<eos> But the questions... they're bullshit, aren't they?<eos> The thing that reveals a person's true character is their reaction to being told that their true character is gonna be revealed.<eos> No comment.
Come on, Amelia Earhart, let's go on an adventure.<eos> You coming?<eos> Mr. Anderson?<eos> I was hoping I could ask you a question.<eos> Alexa.
- Okay, thanks.<eos> - Second team.<eos> - Oh, thank you.<eos> Fat lady alert.<eos> Out of the way.
This is Kyle's version of a joke.<eos> Sweetie... this is Kyle's version of a proposal.<eos> He's offering you a contract marriage.<eos> Let me see this.<eos> "No infidelity.
Sweetie... this is Kyle's version of a proposal.<eos> He's offering you a contract marriage.<eos> Let me see this.<eos> "No infidelity.<eos> "No drug use.
It's crazy.<eos> It... this is all crazy, but...<eos> I-I've got this feeling that I am almost certain of, that if we just go for it...<eos> You should come to Venice with me.<eos> To Italy?
You have to be the one willing to do the things that scare everybody else to death.<eos> That's the difference between talent and success.<eos> You're off to a great start, but you have to keep doing it.<eos> I plan to.<eos> Okay, Annika.
And I always have a backup plan.<eos> - What the hell are you guys doing here?<eos> - We're your backup.<eos> I had a guy on the inside.<eos> - Who?
And why the heel marks?<eos> Because the heel comes down first.<eos> It bears all the weight.<eos> So what do you see?<eos> No prints, nothing.
He's really strong.<eos> He's knocked me down on the lacrosse field more than once.<eos> Now, when I see him coming, I do everything I can to get the hell out of the way.<eos> Brett actually started playing lacrosse for me.<eos> For you?
And he knew we were here, he was waiting for us, tracking us.<eos> He was prepared and we weren't.<eos> There aren't a lot of people who spend time in these tunnels.<eos> Who was the last hunter we saw down here?<eos> Argent...
He was prepared and we weren't.<eos> There aren't a lot of people who spend time in these tunnels.<eos> Who was the last hunter we saw down here?<eos> Argent...<eos> And Gerard.
Yeah, I remember, because it was, like, five minutes ago.<eos> Why would Nolan do that?<eos> He's afraid.<eos> - Of me?<eos> - Of us.
"Love Cannon Alonzo in Champaign."<eos> Hop on that just on the name alone.<eos> _<eos> What the hell?<eos> Prosthetic research?
Man, you got to slow your roll.<eos> Yemen is in a civil war. They're really close to collapse.<eos> It's no place for a white man with an American passport, no command of Arabic, to just show up on a whim.<eos> And yet, apparently, my brother did.<eos> Your brother's intake photo from the Fox River Penitentiary.
I don't think so.<eos> Did you ask the school to hire her?<eos> No.<eos> They must have wanted both of us.<eos> Lucky for everybody.
- I'll pick them up tomorrow.<eos> - Look at these earrings.<eos> How great would this go with your collar.<eos> He's got tons of this stuff.<eos> What the hell?
- Excuse me?<eos> - The dress.<eos> Where did it come from?<eos> - It was a gift.<eos> - From who?
Bye.<eos> I thought the police were looking for her.<eos> What is she doing shuffling around in that instead of an orange jumpsuit?<eos> Because it's all part of the game.<eos> What game?
- No?<eos> I'm the first one who hasn't completed her turn.<eos> Look, I know you're worried but maybe putting Caleb in the hospital and hurting your business was your punishment.<eos> Just try not to freak out over something you can't control.<eos> Hey, Marie.
I love you, too.<eos> A finger?<eos> Someone sent you a finger.<eos> - Are you sure that it's.....<eos> - Archer Dunhill's, yes.
That'd be wonderful.<eos> Well, it's good to see you.<eos> It's great to see you, Hanna.<eos> - Bye, Spencer.<eos> - Bye.
I just...<eos> We...<eos> Need some more time to figure things out.<eos> Do you need anything?<eos> Tea?
Oh, my God, that is so annoying.<eos> Why can't we just lock it up in Ali's house?<eos> I mean, she's out of town this weekend, right?<eos> That's a spectacular idea.<eos> Actually, kind of unspectacular.
So Jenna checked out of the Radley late last night.<eos> - We have to find her.<eos> - We will, Henna.<eos> And I think I know how we do that.<eos> Sydney...
Someone's buying Jenna a new pair of eyes?<eos> 'Whom should I say made the deposit?<eos> ' Just write down the initials, A.D.<eos> - A.D.?<eos> - For anonymous donor.
She was special.<eos> To everyone who walked through that door.<eos> Including a shy kid with glasses.<eos> I can't really picture you as shy.<eos> And chubby.
Well, that's where we'll spend our first Christmas.<eos> And then after that, we can go anywhere.<eos> Iceland Tasmania we could just keep going and going.<eos> Are you happy?<eos> Happiest.
Okay, don't overestimate someone's feeling's for you.<eos> Okay?<eos> It-it's risky.<eos> Okay, well, aren't you taking the same risk?<eos> - With Ali?
You have all files there?<eos> Yeah, uh, just give me about five minutes to get out of here.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Alright.
If you didn't know that you were friends with A then why would you lie about it after you found out.<eos> Lucas, speak!<eos> Because it may be a part of the reason why you were tortured.<eos> Most of the e-mails that I sent in high school were about mean queen Alison.<eos> And her loyal band of followers.
- What did Paige...<eos> - I love you.<eos> You told me not to do this until I was ready.<eos> Do what?<eos> This.
- So we search.<eos> - Discreetly.<eos> You guys are wrong about him.<eos> I can't believe she was in that house.<eos> Mary.
But things have changed.<eos> If this snowball keeps going there is nothing I can do to help you.<eos> What snowball are we discussing?<eos> Every theory that I can come up with to figure out what happened to Archer Dunhill keeps circling back to you and Alison and your friends, especially to you.<eos> Why especially to me?
- Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> How much time is left?<eos> It's 3:59 a.m.<eos> So... seconds.
Doesn't that fall under bad plumbing?<eos> No, this was no accident.<eos> This was staged.<eos> A flood destroyed crucial evidence in a murder investigation.<eos> Dunhill's.
No, this was no accident.<eos> This was staged.<eos> A flood destroyed crucial evidence in a murder investigation.<eos> Dunhill's.<eos> Just curious.
But Hanna and I didn't have anything to do with it.<eos> She only came to pick me up...<eos> Caleb, Detective Furey keeps circling back to you.<eos> He seems to think that this stunt may have had something to do with protecting<eos> Hanna and her friends.
Don't you like your pie?<eos> It's okay.<eos> Do you mind?<eos> Who you waiting for?<eos> Nobody.
Hanna and I are married.<eos> You mean you're going to get married?<eos> No, I mean we're married.<eos> - What, since when?<eos> - Since tonight.
No wonder you didn't want her going down any more holes.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Thanks.<eos> There is a part of me, though, that, wants to say I'm sorry.<eos> To whom?
For what?<eos> Don't you dare apologize for being with me.<eos> And don't you dare forget it, any of it.<eos> 'Cause I won't.<eos> - "To whom?"
Do you believe that she killed Archer Dunhill?<eos> What I believe and what I can prove are two different things.<eos> Go home.<eos> You're not criminals.<eos> Not really.
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.<eos> Sure, whatever.<eos> Yeah, I'm just saying, sometimes, certain... Certain sons of bitches, they just need to be plain old eradicated.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - World's just better minus them.<eos> Like Abu Ramal.
I got to s... see your face.<eos> Freeze! Get your hands up!<eos> Go easy, son.<eos> How we doing?<eos> Hey. Better than you.
Okay? And things are so different with you, and...<eos> I don't know, I guess I've never been with somebody that I loved before.<eos> I love you too, Ali.<eos> No more secrets.<eos> No more secrets.
Elizabeth Viola claims you assaulted her. I can assure you this is no laughing matter.<eos> - Who?<eos> - Elizabeth Holly Viola.<eos> I know this doesn't sound like you, but I have to take these things seriously.<eos> Unbelievable.
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _
- Not at this time.<eos> We're out of the key ingredient, and we don't know how to get more.<eos> So why haven't Liv and Major taken the cure?<eos> Side effects include severe retrograde amnesia.<eos> Like Blaine.
This is my jam.<eos> So, the electrons in this sodium solution, when charged by a positive cathode, release stress hormones that stimulate the amygdala and strengthen the signal sent to neurons required for memory storage.<eos> That's not how I'd do it.<eos> I'm close to full memory restoration.<eos> For 17 lucky zombies.
How'd he get out alive?<eos> Let the record show that the officer in question is trying to prevent our friend Billy from speaking.<eos> What is the government trying to hide?<eos> What does the government have to hide?<eos> _
I'm glad you called.<eos> Volunteers?<eos> Come on now. Just a few more steps.<eos> Ravi. Always working' late.<eos> Oh, my office?
Someone's in good spirits.<eos> Guess who found a job, a job where no one cares if you've been publicly accused of being a serial killer?<eos> Why's Liv sacked out on your couch?<eos> So... You have a little time for some Go Fish?<eos> Maybe some Gin Rummy?
One problem.<eos> What?<eos> You're thinking too small.<eos> I need some aspirin.<eos> And a new brain.
To take back our city, we backed Marcel Gerard.<eos> Now, since then, we fought hard to build this community.<eos> And in the next week, as we celebrate our independence, that community will be challenged... because every year we get visitors.<eos> Vampires.<eos> Vampires from all over the world...
You pay me for information, and I have quite a bit to share.<eos> As predicted, Klaus' enemies are flocking to New Orleans to celebrate.<eos> However, some are seeking allies among your witches.<eos> No doubt they want to befriend the very covens that still resent you, start conflict, undermine your power, and perhaps steal your prize trophy.<eos> Klaus himself. Oh.
Look, there's two ways this can go.<eos> The nice, easy way... or the other way.<eos> You know, once I figured you suffered enough, I pulled this out.<eos> And on that day you said a word that I've never heard you say.<eos> "Mercy."
and keeper of the Flame.<eos> Until another ascends, Azgeda honors and will defend the coalition of the last true Commander...<eos> Lexa kom Trikru, including the 13th clan.<eos> Let it be known that an attack against Skaikru is an attack against us all.<eos> From your king.
Yeah, maybe.<eos> Did Luke explain about meals?<eos> No.<eos> By the time we got to that, he was onto some musical thing.<eos> - That.
- Dear Jesus...<eos> - Take us to church.<eos> Allah, Oprah, My Little Pony, or whoever your personal savior is... help us to give our bodies what they need to grow strong and beautiful because every single person at this table deserves to live.<eos> - Mm.<eos> - Amen. Bon appétit.
- Come on, just a little. Get it on you.<eos> Come on, get it on you.<eos> Right?<eos> Now, a little bite... for me.<eos> - For you? - Mm-hmm.
Yeah, get in on that. - Is anybody watching this movie?<eos> - Nobody cares about dragons.<eos> How are you doing after family therapy?<eos> It's pretty much how it always is when my folks are together.<eos> - Minus your dad.
- No, I mean, really okay.<eos> Like they might get lives and be semi-interesting people.<eos> Did you just say something vaguely optimistic?<eos> I did say "semi"... but... yeah.<eos> - So, the family...
Face some hard facts and you could have an incredible life.<eos> That's your pearl of wisdom?<eos> Grow a pair?<eos> That's a more concise way of putting it.<eos> Unbelievable.
Well, if you like it now, wait till you see it by candlelight.<eos> Oh, I'm... I'm so sorry.<eos> Um, well, if you two get back together, you know where I'll be.<eos> That was my 2:00.<eos> Apparently,
Nice to meet you, Travis.<eos> Oh, and you know Daphne.<eos> Hey, how's it going?<eos> - Good.<eos> You?
- Yeah.<eos> - Well, at least it's over now, right?<eos> - I'm not so sure.<eos> Aidan McManus is the son of Leonard McManus.<eos> - The lawyer?
Did you have any contact with Gemma during these visits?<eos> Not really.<eos> She stayed out of our way.<eos> - Why was that?<eos> - Guilt.
I have to believe it was their fault.<eos> Because if they're not to blame...<eos> Even if we confirm he made the calls, does that really give him an alibi?<eos> Well, it depends on the location of the phone.<eos> And the exact timing of the calls.
That middle section is not Tuesday.<eos> It's been replaced by footage from another night.<eos> Now get the Geek Squad onto that island.<eos> I want that missing bit found.<eos> - And Tom Jervis.
It's been replaced by footage from another night.<eos> Now get the Geek Squad onto that island.<eos> I want that missing bit found.<eos> - And Tom Jervis.<eos> - Tom?
And in addition to Tom's prints, we've got a match for Gemma's.<eos> We now know why she was calling his probation officer.<eos> Who does this third set belong to?<eos> Ah, they belong to this guy -<eos> - Ben Copeland.
What did your missus think of your heroics?<eos> Very impressed!<eos> Three sets of prints, including yours and this fella's.<eos> You know him, don't you?<eos> - No comment.
You know him, don't you?<eos> - No comment.<eos> - Old mate of yours from Newcastle.<eos> Hobbies include bringing drugs into the UK.<eos> No comment.
- Old mate of yours from Newcastle.<eos> Hobbies include bringing drugs into the UK.<eos> No comment.<eos> Or perhaps you just pull it ashore and pass it onto the nice tourists.<eos> - No comment.
- and I hold onto it.<eos> That's all. - Yet her prints are here.<eos> She found it, but she wasn't gonna say anything.<eos> She knew how hard I was trying to get away.<eos> - From your mates in Newcastle?
This is the last place I remember seeing her happy.<eos> Right, well, how many of these have you taken?<eos> I came to collect her one Sunday, messing about in that old truck. Pretending to drive it.<eos> - Michael, how many?<eos> - None.
Don't you wanna get out of here?<eos> Yeah.<eos> But I have to learn how to control my power first.<eos> And it's a relief to be in a place where I don't have to keep it a secret.<eos> Secret?
Where is he?<eos> Hold my broom.<eos> And I'll go find him.<eos> How did you do that?<eos> A lot of practice.
And you're all going to Azra together.<eos> Is that right?<eos> This is your home now.<eos> It is our mission to control your gift.<eos> "Gift"?
Whether there be one man, or a thousand.<eos> I swear to protect my family.<eos> _<eos> There's no coming back from what you did.<eos> What?
Just tell me that she's still alive.<eos> What kind of a mother do you think I am?<eos> I don't know what I think you are anymore.<eos> First you betray Veil.<eos> Then Sunny.
You're going to Hell. You know that, right?<eos> Yeah, I did know a Sarah from Coronado once.<eos> Best pole dancer I ever saw.<eos> Sarah's a fine name.<eos> Sarita.
You know how many times we've rolled snake eyes with this guy?<eos> So, what do you think?<eos> You know what I think.<eos> All right, let's do this.<eos> Right, Amigo?
Take the girls inside.<eos> Now!<eos> Girls, run!<eos> Stand by. Stand by.<eos> Ready.
Grenade!<eos> Jesus!<eos> What the hell? Are you hit?<eos> No, no.<eos> Help!
No, no, no.<eos> Wait, you can't...<eos> How was it?<eos> Good. We all got back.<eos> You ready?
Yes, I made it.<eos> Where is your mother?<eos> Like I would know.<eos> You could call Brad, but he says you're a war criminal.<eos> A what?
No, I just don't think of you. Okay.<eos> Just because I'm your father doesn't... Look, you know this isn't cool, right?<eos> Showing up here unannounced in the middle of...<eos> What?<eos> Everything.
Because if you don't mind, I'd like to get Eddie and get the fuck out of here, all right?<eos> Yeah, well, about that, listen.<eos> About what?<eos> About... About what?<eos> About nothing.
But he was a good friend. He was a great dancer, and he was an excellent con.<eos> And he was the brother that you never had.<eos> So to Charlie. - Charlie. - Charlie.<eos> No, you don't have to do that.<eos> Charlie.
And, Mrs. Aherne, if you or Margaret ever need anything from me... anything at all... you can call me day or night.<eos> This is Mrs. Siemasko and her daughter Jenn.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I got my wires crossed a little.<eos> - Uh... - Bye.
Well, now do you believe me?<eos> I don't even know where to begin.<eos> But yes, I believe you.<eos> Your brother is one world-class son of a bitch.<eos> No offense.
I just... I really wish you'd told me about these plans of yours before you went out and did it.<eos> I know, Howard, and I regret misleading you.<eos> It's just that a certain... vérité had to be established.<eos> I'm not talking about the heart attack that you nearly gave me.<eos> Chuck, this tape...
Oh, I doubt we could even get in the door over there.<eos> Chuck, if that tape is useless in a court of law and no help in the court of public opinion, what's the point?<eos> Because I can't think of a single use for it.<eos> I can.<eos> _
No, thank you for cleaning up that mess McGill left behind.<eos> Actually, would you mind if I messenger that over tomorrow morning, first thing?<eos> I'd like to take one last look before we submit, just double-check a few things.<eos> Sure.<eos> So, tomorrow, first thing?
Blanket covers the wire.<eos> Now it's about those lights going out.<eos> He didn't flash it 24 hours before.<eos> - That's supposed to be the signal. - Have faith.<eos> Seven straight nights?
I have to get my family on a flight tonight<eos> - before the airport shuts down. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> Hold up.<eos> We need tickets, too, three of them.<eos> One for me, one for Michael, one for C.
You have another option?<eos> Quick. I'm leaving the city.<eos> Nowhere is safe anymore.<eos> I need two passports.<eos> One for me, one for my brother, Michael Scofield.
We're far from good.<eos> By tomorrow, we won't have to worry about him.<eos> Keep your head down.<eos> Don't make eye contact with anybody.<eos> A lot of ISIL sympathizers everywhere.
- Here it is... immunity.<eos> Wes, come to the house right away.<eos> No, no!<eos> Wipe it clean.<eos> Everything on it.
I can take you upstairs, give you immunity.<eos> You should go.<eos> Don't call me again.<eos> - Visitor.<eos> - For who?
You should go.<eos> Don't call me again.<eos> - Visitor.<eos> - For who?<eos> Her.
After that, you gave him a job, brought him into your home.<eos> A little unorthodox.<eos> Was he working as an investigator for you?<eos> I killed him.<eos> Frank...
Sam deserved it.<eos> Even Annalise would tell you that if she could.<eos> Back here.<eos> Every action you take right now has consequences for us.<eos> - Michaela.
That's bad, but...<eos> I get how scary this can be, finding out about all the... awfulness.<eos> So...<eos> I'm here if you ever need to... talk or... you just... want a hug.<eos> Michaela!
They're meeting with Atwood right now.<eos> Russia.<eos> They don't extradite to the U.S.<eos> They don't like gay people there.<eos> Or black people.
You killed her.<eos> - Stop.<eos> - Admit it.<eos> I killed your dad.<eos> Not Rebecca.
We'll all still be here.<eos> Mr. Hampton, what exactly is it you do for the Middleton Legal Clinic?<eos> I was hired as a technology expert, keeping case files locked.<eos> Did that include any of Annalise's personal case files?<eos> No. Just the clinic.
You said you didn't believe me.<eos> Anna Mae, listen...<eos> And how was I supposed to make you believe me, huh?<eos> You want proof?<eos> Pictures?
Nobody's crazy.<eos> We're all crazy!<eos> I mean, God, look at us.<eos> We're sitting around debating who murdered our friend.<eos> Your friend?
Do you even care about that?<eos> Do any of you?<eos> - Laurel, we all feel bad. - Yeah.<eos> Then think about what that means!<eos> And not just for you, but for Wes.
We're co-counsel now.<eos> We get to meet in private, all communications between us are privileged.<eos> So, when do you want to have our first meeting?<eos> Celestine's gonna expect a call tomorrow.<eos> And Thelonius.
Otherwise, it won't just be a threat.<eos> I will not stand by and let baseless accusations be leveled at any of my prosecutors.<eos> And I won't stand by while you frame my client for murder.<eos> You think Ingrid Peters is gonna take Keating's accusations seriously?<eos> She better.
Of course not. Yeah.<eos> Connor told me you got out on bail, which I guess is cause for congratulations.<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> That depends.<eos> On... ?
On... ?<eos> If we're still good.<eos> "Good"?<eos> Well, a lot has changed since we last spoke.<eos> Yeah, well, not for me.
Wes deserved so much better than you.<eos> Um... Laurel didn't mean that.<eos> Yes, she did. But that's all right.<eos> I'm sorry about your baby.<eos> And, uh... Wes, too.
- I'm just saying, we should ask him...<eos> - Mm! You will do nothing of the sort.<eos> You will forget we ever had this conversation and promise to never bring it up again.<eos> Yes?<eos> Michaela...
Uh, yeah, I did.<eos> No, I knew she left a message for Laurel and Wes, but not you.<eos> I got the voicemail the next day.<eos> Why are you asking me about this?<eos> No reason.
No, I knew she left a message for Laurel and Wes, but not you.<eos> I got the voicemail the next day.<eos> Why are you asking me about this?<eos> No reason.<eos> No naked Nate pics, huh?
He asked about you.<eos> Did you know her when she was pregnant?<eos> I was a 1-L.<eos> Was she happy?<eos> Happier.
Yes.<eos> Why?<eos> I forged a signature on the form ordering the transfer of Wesley Gibbins' body.<eos> The signature of an investigator from your office...<eos> Nate Lahey?
Yes.<eos> Can you explain to the court why you would tamper with evidence this way?<eos> Objection... argumentative.<eos> It's probative to the key issue of my motion...<eos> Malicious prosecution.
Merely asking the witness to clarify, Your Honor.<eos> Apart from the third-degree burns sustained postmortem, I observed no other traumatic injuries.<eos> No further questions.<eos> Mr. Denver?<eos> Nothing from our side, Your Honor.
Have you been ingesting illegal substances?<eos> My client here is understandably upset about his boyfriend being missing.<eos> While your lack of urgency in this matter could be construed as insensitive at best but homophobic at worst, we'll ignore that if you at least let us file a missing-persons report.<eos> - When did you say he went missing?<eos> - Last night around 7:00 p.m.
You lost him after he discovered the burner phone you used to frame my client.<eos> That's a good story.<eos> Be careful who catches you in here.<eos> You find him?<eos> Denver, yes, not Connor.
There's no way I could live with myself, so just... please, come home.<eos> Wes killed my husband.<eos> He confessed to it on the voice-mail he left that night.<eos> And that he killed his girlfriend, Rebecca Sutter.<eos> Help!
And that he killed his girlfriend, Rebecca Sutter.<eos> Help!<eos> Your detectives called him to the station that day, confronted him about what he'd done.<eos> He had the chance to sign the deal and pin it all on me.<eos> Help!
Help!<eos> Please!<eos> Why didn't he?<eos> Well, because no one knew the Wes Gibbins I did.<eos> Help!
_<eos> - Hey. How are you feeling?<eos> Body is fine.<eos> My head is trying to figure out how to get those passports we couldn't get last night.<eos> For you, those kids.
I will show the world what happens when you screw Abu Ramal.<eos> On your knees!<eos> - It's not gonna happen.<eos> - Make them on their knees!<eos> Enough!
Are you...<eos> You're not shutting down, are you?<eos> I would never endanger the firm.<eos> This is mostly from my personal funds.<eos> And a few loans.
Me and my family? We built this whole business.<eos> We all did. Together.<eos> No, no!<eos> Salamanca did!<eos> Salamanca money!
We all did. Together.<eos> No, no!<eos> Salamanca did!<eos> Salamanca money!<eos> Salamanca blood!
Oh, I will.<eos> All right. Screw it.<eos> "Mockingbird" encore, it is.<eos> No.<eos> Oh, shit.
"Mockingbird" encore, it is.<eos> No.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> What? What is it?<eos> Mrs. Landry.
We work together or we both die.<eos> You have my word.<eos> It's abu ramal that Poseidon wants free.<eos> Kellerman: Poseidon sent you?<eos> Enough!
A psychopath.<eos> A frustrated policy wonk in the CIA who felt he could do better than his superiors.<eos> So he created a cell within the CIA called 21-void, implementing his own intelligence operations.<eos> And he needed my help breaking out people imprisoned all over the world.<eos> Terrorists, political dissidents rogue agents...
And if I did it, you and Sara, you'd go free.<eos> Your record's expunged, but... there was a rub.<eos> I wasn't allowed to have contact with any of you, including my son.<eos> So, Michael Scofield was dead and over the years i assumed many names.<eos> Kaniel outis... the most recent.
There's a reason you're my whip hand.<eos> A reason that's gonna change your life.<eos> There's a light at the end of the tunnel for you.<eos> Lincoln: What the hell was that?<eos> Whip:
Hey. Lincoln: I got someone Iwantyoutotalk to.<eos> Oh, man! Now that's a voice i never thought I'd hear again.<eos> Man, you got some explaining to do, brother, risenfromthedeadandall.<eos> Uh, hangar two.<eos> Right off the main runway.
Understand?<eos> You know it's been four years since I've had air conditioning?<eos> I'm done with the heat.<eos> Kind of like it out here.<eos> No walls.
My opinion, you know what you need more than anything else in the world?<eos> Got to laugh more.<eos> If he wants to laugh, Phaeacia's the place.<eos> I always wanted to bring Sheba; For her to see the people.<eos> No technology, no politics, no modern nonsense.
If he wants to laugh, Phaeacia's the place.<eos> I always wanted to bring Sheba; For her to see the people.<eos> No technology, no politics, no modern nonsense.<eos> They know how to enjoy life.<eos> No technology?
Hold on, let me try something else.<eos> Can you see me now?<eos> No.<eos> Take a screen capture.<eos> What of?
21-Void doesn't exist.<eos> Poseidon will clean house.<eos> The problem's not going away.<eos> That State Department agent wants to meet as soon as we land.<eos> Chania, please?
Uh, we need to widen the search.<eos> Oh, wait. The oracle speaks.<eos> Who should Billie sleep with? Who?<eos> Uh, that guy, a street mime, animal from the Muppets?<eos> Who, Oracle, who?
She said... she said what was okay?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Okay, do you know where she went?<eos> With-with who?<eos> Oh, some reporter.
Come with me... into my network.<eos> We will evolve beyond them.<eos> And together we can avenge what they have done to us.<eos> Come.<eos> With me.
People with guns really scare me.<eos> And if I'm scared, I can't do my job.<eos> And if I can't do my job, then people die.<eos> And if people die, then who am I tech-supporting?<eos> Literally no one.
You and your entire team were lost in the blast along with the device itself.<eos> If the world thinks Pandora's Box is gone, then they won't know we're using it to spy on them.<eos> You're just another tyrant.<eos> No.<eos> Patriot.
- You haven't seen Ed recently?<eos> - I'm afraid you've been misinformed.<eos> You should be afraid that I'm gonna shoot you in the.<eos> Seriously?<eos> Under the fuckin' bed?
Is this one okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> My name is Walter.<eos> I can tell by your accent you must be a relation to the bride's father.<eos> Close relation?
Bina lost her virginity to a loser immigrant named Tom Fo.<eos> He was from Canada.<eos> From the province of Canada that produces the most insufferable people.<eos> That's not true.<eos> Manitoba.
I think you know what it is I ask.<eos> If I have offended you, I apologize, and ask that we forget the matter entirely.<eos> Your work here will be unaffected.<eos> Look at yourself, how beautiful you are.<eos> Your left leg forward.
I think you're just gonna drool around. What is it? And then you're just gonna go through there and then like that.<eos> If I was going to relive the same day over and over, I wanted it to be a worthy day.<eos> But not just for me.<eos> Do the kids at school ever make fun of you for the way that you talk?<eos> Sometimes.
I'm trying, Kasia.<eos> I'm trying, my darling.<eos> Wait, wait, wait.<eos> - You should go. You can go. - Why isn't that man armed?<eos> Whoa, Tembo.
Wait, wait, wait.<eos> - You should go. You can go. - Why isn't that man armed?<eos> Whoa, Tembo.<eos> - What's his name?<eos> - Tembo.
- You should go. You can go. - Why isn't that man armed?<eos> Whoa, Tembo.<eos> - What's his name?<eos> - Tembo.<eos> Tembo!
Whoa, Tembo.<eos> - What's his name?<eos> - Tembo.<eos> Tembo!<eos> Tembo.
We'll raise pigs in the pens to feed your men, and we will save our zoo.<eos> Pigs.<eos> Well, they're cheap to farm, of course, but how would you feed them?<eos> We could collect garbage from the ghetto.<eos> Of course, with your permission.
Yeah, it was a knockout in the second round.<eos> I lost everything. Hang tight, guy.<eos> - Now, you're buying this time.<eos> - Not today, buddy.<eos> Ithoughtaboutmylife .

I can't get over how amazing you look.<eos> I thought you'd be some... nasty, skanky, rat-haired, snaggle-toothed... sore-infested ho.<eos> But look... it's like you came through the gauntlet without a scratch!<eos> Wilson, you showed up at my work and called me a crack whore.<eos> In front of Melissa!
I mean, I could do without all the overcompensatory display of class privileges... but...<eos> I mean, Christ, what kind of example is that?<eos> It's like they're laughing at the next generation.<eos> "We used up all your resources.<eos> Fuck you."
Now that I'm pulling it together here... I feel like I'm ready for an actual relationship.<eos> And that's why... Tucker and I are moving to Australia.<eos> What did...?<eos> I just... Could you...? Did you...?<eos> Tucker?
Well, you know, if you'd have seen me when I first got out... forty months of eating pure crap and... sitting in a little room with a window this wide...<eos> So, did you hear from your mother?<eos> You know, she's run off to Australia with her N.A. sponsor.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Tucker.
No...<eos> She's sailing straight toward us.<eos> Open fire!<eos> What are you?<eos> Death.
He was clearly a common thief.<eos> The memory of my father will not be befouled by the tongue of a pirate!<eos> This diary is my birthright.<eos> Left to me on the steps of a children's home.<eos> Along with a name and nothing else.
Capitán, Capitán!<eos> Oh, crap!<eos> I've got ya.<eos> Who am I to you?<eos> Treasure.
I was 16. A friend was having a party in his basement<eos> Something had happened to the jukebox. It got knocked around when he was moving it, so the only song it'd play was "Sh-Boom" over and over.<eos> She was this tiny, little blonde with enormous blue eyes.<eos> Just gorgeous.<eos> Very funny, too.
What'd you do with the money?<eos> We all know you stole it. Of course you took it.<eos> You're a criminal! I got fucked over, too! By my own father!<eos> Yeah, is that your whore? I see you, whore!<eos> Hey!
- What are you doing here?<eos> I I was just in the neighborhood and I thought I'd drop by to see if you want to have lunch.<eos> That Chanel No. 5?<eos> Every now and then it's fun.<eos> Honey pot.
Ça va Marie, et vous?<eos> How is your little dog?<eos> Still peeing on the sofa, but what can you do?<eos> Well, either kill him or learn to live with it.<eos> - Like men?
How is your little dog?<eos> Still peeing on the sofa, but what can you do?<eos> Well, either kill him or learn to live with it.<eos> - Like men?<eos> - Well, not all men.
Still peeing on the sofa, but what can you do?<eos> Well, either kill him or learn to live with it.<eos> - Like men?<eos> - Well, not all men.<eos> All of them.
- Our friend will pick us up.<eos> All right. You need to move on.<eos> We have a little fun right here.<eos> Quite frankly, I don't know if you're gonna come back.<eos> Careful with that.
All right. All right.<eos> Look, he's got to go.<eos> His game is now.<eos> You got to pick him up 'cause I got stuff I got to do...<eos> No, no. Not again. Not again.
It was supposed to be a small deal this week.<eos> 25 kilos, you know, just to give them a taste.<eos> Then my idiot cousin decides to become a DEA informant, and we lose an entire shipment.<eos> But me, I step up and I promise my father that our Canadian pie is safe, and that I could cover the shortage with an extra<eos> 25 kilos.

Hey, D.<eos> Do you have him?<eos> Yeah. Got a text from him.<eos> Said he was going to meet some shorty at the Luxus casino.<eos> What girl?
Yeah. Got a text from him.<eos> Said he was going to meet some shorty at the Luxus casino.<eos> What girl?<eos> You know, the...<eos> With the girl.

- Go hunting today?<eos> - Just got back.<eos> - Get lucky?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Nice one.
No, no, you're just being honest.<eos> Yeah, I haven't been doing this very long.<eos> Actually, you're my first.<eos> - Your first, what?<eos> - My first victim.
Jack!<eos> What's up?<eos> Did you hear that scream?<eos> - Scream?<eos> - Just now.
We'll take it from here.<eos> - Who the hell are you?<eos> - Qualified personnel.<eos> Look, I have a city contract, to salvage all this, okay?<eos> With the city, so...
- Hey, man.<eos> - What's up, Mr. Delmar?<eos> - Hey, Mr. Parker.<eos> Number five, right?<eos> Yeah, and with pickles.
- That's not your car.<eos> That's his car.<eos> How was I supposed to know it's his car?<eos> What's he doing with the window?<eos> Everyday with these damn alarms.
How many times have I told you...<eos> Not to fire them out in the open?<eos> - You said move the merchandise!<eos> - Under the radar.<eos> Under the radar!
- Like, all the time?<eos> - It's called the Baby Monitor Protocol.<eos> - Yeah, of course, it is.<eos> - Yeah, just roll it back to last Friday.<eos> - With pleasure.
This way.<eos> Everyone, let's uh.. Set up a stake here.. There is so much here that doesn't make sense.<eos> I will talk to him.<eos> Brother to brother.<eos> Tennessee?
Do you copy?<eos> Covenant come in.<eos> This is expedition party reporting.<eos> Do you read me?<eos> Tennessee?
They can be quite severe...<eos> Shielding the whole planet.<eos> How long the storms usually last?<eos> Days.<eos> Weeks.
We're not just, like, a couple of white assholes.<eos> No offense.<eos> I really need it.<eos> I just want to, like, sip a mai tai and smoke a j, and then just kinda, like start having red wine at night.<eos> And then scotch.
That is what it looked like.<eos> 'Cause when I drink sometimes it smells like soup.<eos> Hey, do you know what? Shall we?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Hey, what kind of soup?
Yeah.<eos> It's awesome, mom. Thanks, honey.<eos> Roger, why don't you tell us a story?<eos> You've been an expedition guide for forever, right?<eos> Expedition guide?
Is that girl a sleepwalker, Alex?<eos> Where are you?<eos> In there.<eos> - In there.<eos> With you.
How do you know my name?<eos> A better question would be:<eos> Why wouldn't I know your name?<eos> You've been running around with my daughter, haven't you?<eos> Daughter?
Hey, you don't answer your phone calls, no email, nothing.<eos> Jensen's pissed.<eos> And I saved your ass.<eos> I talked to the rancho clients myself, fuck you very much. - Clients?<eos> What clients?
That tomb is what led us to Ahmanet.<eos> I think she is the princess in the legend.<eos> The hieroglyphics said that she murdered her father.<eos> - Murdered?<eos> - Along with his child.
Oh Nick.<eos> You did this for me?<eos> Yes.<eos> I have made so many many mistakes.<eos> But not this time.
You did this for me?<eos> Yes.<eos> I have made so many many mistakes.<eos> But not this time.<eos> Not you.
He found his redemption.<eos> But at great cost.<eos> He is a monster now.<eos> He is also still a man.<eos> A good man.
No matter.<eos> Your friend's soul will be collected, and there's nothing you can do to alter that.<eos> Why don't you go do something useful, like haunt a house?<eos> - Who's he talking to now?<eos> - Shrouds.
Do not worry.<eos> It is only yellow warning.<eos> The red alert is the most dangerous.<eos> Can I talk to someone else?<eos> - With whom?
It is only yellow warning.<eos> The red alert is the most dangerous.<eos> Can I talk to someone else?<eos> - With whom?<eos> - With someone smarter?
Partly because of your health insurance, And partly.<eos> Because it is difficult to get kidneys.<eos> Yes, everyone clings to both of them.<eos> Have you spoken to your daughter?<eos> With your friends?
I'll go, Sam.<eos> - Where did they go?<eos> - I do not know!<eos> I thought they were with you!<eos> 2.30 pm
I stayed there during most of the Carnival period.<eos> They will all say they bought it From an old handsome. He wears a gray hat.<eos> Then we went to the festival, I was working in a girls' spinning booth Until the second, Then a local solution Mr. "Milton Kubchak".<eos> Al was there all day.<eos> At 2.30 pm?
25 years?<eos> Has all this time passed?<eos> Looks like 25 days, right?<eos> Yes.<eos> Under water.
Hey, there's a little girl back here.<eos> - She armed? - No. No, I don't think so.<eos> All right, Enzo, check the back.<eos> He's saying his girl is sick and he's taking her to a relative who has an apothecary.<eos> - A what?
Well, of course he can talk.<eos> It's all he ever does.<eos> Now, Lumiere, as head of the household... I demand that you put her back in her cell at once.<eos> What do you want to be for the rest of your life, Cogsworth? A man, or a mantle clock?<eos> Ready, miss?
The master remains a beast forever.<eos> And we become... - Antiques.<eos> - Knick-knacks.<eos> Lightly-used houseware.<eos> Rubbish.
You're all so different.<eos> Elousia is not what I expected at all.<eos> And Sarayu, oh, geez.<eos> Sarayu is creativity.<eos> Action.
Thanks.<eos> Just to be clear, we're not justifying anything.<eos> We'd like to heal it, if you'd let us.<eos> Before you go, there's something in the garden I was hoping you could help me with before tomorrow's celebration.<eos> What celebration?
There must be at least a few who are to blame for all the pain and suffering in the world.<eos> Right?<eos> Uh-huh. Right.<eos> What about the selfish?<eos> The greedy?
Look around, Mackenzie.<eos> Don't forget to enjoy the journey.<eos> Here we are.<eos> This is it?<eos> To your eyes.
Who, Mack, was where?<eos> I gotta talk to Kate.<eos> - Hey, hey, settle down.<eos> - And Nan.<eos> And Josh.
The word is, you have a sweetheart, Mr. Wentworth.<eos> How do you know?<eos> Detective Miller. He works for me on the side.<eos> I thought Styvesan worked for you.<eos> Among many others.
You're not exactly a model student.<eos> - Are you questioning my academic prowess? - I am, yeah.<eos> All right, well, I'm seeing Charlie after school, but come by later, yeah?<eos> Sure.<eos> - Charlie Gibbs or Charlie Penford? - Uh, Charlie Gibbs.
- Are you questioning my academic prowess? - I am, yeah.<eos> All right, well, I'm seeing Charlie after school, but come by later, yeah?<eos> Sure.<eos> - Charlie Gibbs or Charlie Penford? - Uh, Charlie Gibbs.<eos> As in Charlotte?
Why would they be in the bushes?<eos> -You okay, Dad? -Sure.<eos> Yeah. We have to go out to dinner, with the hominids.<eos> -Who's that?<eos> -Great apes.
I really feel guilty about the phone.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Were you just on my phone?<eos> Who were you talking to?<eos> -You.
Well, either way...<eos> Either way, Kate is great. The eternal intern.<eos> Sweet, tolerant, tolerant Kate.<eos> She won't mind, she's fine. Well, no.<eos> Not anymore, Stan.
Go play Okie dickhead somewhere else.<eos> Hey, Carl... it looks like Mr. Munson hired some muscle.<eos> Looks that way.<eos> He's a friend of mine.<eos> A friend with a big mouth.
We're leaving tomorrow before dawn.<eos> We're gonna cross the border.<eos> It's a safe haven.<eos> Same coordinates?<eos> Yes, between noon and 5:00.
- You, not hungry?<eos> You're always hungry.<eos> Did you get them something to eat when you were out?<eos> - Just hot chocolate.<eos> - With marshmallows and licorice.
You have to do something or he's never going to get the message.<eos> No, we don't.<eos> You see, Andy has sent a message to us.<eos> Over the course of these past four years at this school Andy has revealed himself to be a truly remarkable human being.<eos> - A prodigy, really.
I'm a pushover, right?<eos> All right, guys, come on.<eos> I'm down for the pranks, but frankly we're getting...<eos> And "Mr. Dick Suck's English class" again!<eos> In Sharpie!
- What happened to you?<eos> I... I got into a little bit of a fight.<eos> With who?<eos> You look like hell!<eos> - With another teacher. Yeah.
- Come on.<eos> Make it whole wheat.<eos> And can I have some pork and beans with that?<eos> No dog.<eos> Just tuna fish.
Forget it.<eos> This motorbike is fine with me.<eos> Try it once.<eos> It rides like a plane!<eos> Next time. Bye.
Let me pour out my feelings now<eos> I love you<eos> I love you<eos> I love you<eos> Awesome!
His mind has inevitably turned to more spiritual matters.<eos> We are the only salvation.<eos> The blackest of their dirt deeds bind them to us.<eos> No. No.<eos> Not to us, no.
..we do need to get on.<eos> - Yes, of course.<eos> 'Do your research.<eos> 'I'm not a hero - I'm a high-functioning sociopath.<eos> '..sociopath.
Awesome, isn't it?<eos> He drowned, Mr Holmes.<eos> - That's what we thought.<eos> But when they opened up his lungs... - Yes? - ..<eos> Superficial.
She's my friend. And she's under my protection.<eos> Who are you?<eos> I'm the man who's going to kill your friend.<eos> Who's Sherlock Holmes?<eos> Not a policeman.
Perfect.<eos> They're going to be coughing green now that you went with my brilliant suggestions.<eos> Well, a guy will agree to just about anything after a great...<eos> - Dinner?<eos> - Dinner.
[grunts] Anyways, I gotta focus. Okay.<eos> So what are you doing up here?<eos> Did you follow me?<eos> I, uh, came with...<eos> Billy. Billy Cranston? Weird.
- It's hard to explain, really.<eos> I don't...<eos> The morphing grid is never wrong.<eos> If the power coins have returned to the ship with these...<eos> Teenagers!
You must never escalate a fight, unless your enemy forces you to.<eos> And you must never reveal your identity. Ever.<eos> To assume your ranger identities, you need to morph.<eos> Have any of you morphed before?<eos> - Yes. But only in the shower.
Nobody ever has to get to know me and uh, my parents don't have to worry about my relationships.<eos> [Zack] Boyfriend troubles?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Boyfriend troubles.<eos> Girlfriend troubles?
Get my crystal!<eos> We're alive.<eos> [Blue Ranger] Guys, we're alive!<eos> We're like one big, uh... one big Zord.<eos> Like a mama Zord.
We're like one big, uh... one big Zord.<eos> Like a mama Zord.<eos> - What?<eos> - No, no, no. That sounds lame.<eos> Um... a Megazord!
Like a mama Zord.<eos> - What?<eos> - No, no, no. That sounds lame.<eos> Um... a Megazord!<eos> How?
We should have shut you down years ago.<eos> This is an opportunity for our country.<eos> Listen, senator, Landsat is sending a mission to the island.<eos> We could piggyback on that operation.<eos> With your permission, of course.
Weaver.<eos> Yeah, it's Jerry.<eos> Hey, Jerry.<eos> So, tell me, did I get it?<eos> That Landsat thing?
Oh, shit!<eos> - Watch out!<eos> - What is it?<eos> - Watch your six!<eos> - Up above!
- Watch out!<eos> - What is it?<eos> - Watch your six!<eos> - Up above!<eos> Up in the trees!
- Shake it off, guys!<eos> - Let's move out.<eos> Stay tight.<eos> What the hell is this?<eos> Behind you!
Is there anyone out there? Hey!<eos> This is fox five. We hear you.<eos> We're on a boat.<eos> We're on a boat headed up north on a river.<eos> A boat?
I know Mary's dead and I know your heart is broken, but if Sherlock Holmes dies too, who will you have then?<eos> Because I'll tell you something, John Watson, you will not have me!<eos> Have you spoken to Mycroft?<eos> Molly?<eos> Anyone?
Really?<eos> I correctly anticipated the responses of people I know well to scenarios I devised.<eos> - Can't everyone do that?<eos> - How?<eos> Except the boot.
Come along.<eos> The game is on.<eos> Do you still miss me?<eos> Speaking of serial killers, you know who's my favourite?<eos> Other than yourself?
I was trying to help him!<eos> - Sherlock, what was he doing to you?<eos> - Suffocating me, overdosing me.<eos> - On what?<eos> - Saline.
- Sherlock, what was he doing to you?<eos> - Suffocating me, overdosing me.<eos> - On what?<eos> - Saline.<eos> - Saline?
New information, she's out.<eos> That's not possible.<eos> It's more than possible, she was John's therapist.<eos> - Shot me during a session.<eos> - Only with a tranquilliser.
That's where our sister has been since early childhood.<eos> She hasn't left, not for a single day.<eos> Whoever you both met, it can't have been her.<eos> ♪ I that am lost Oh, who will find me ♪<eos> ♪ Deep down below the old beech tree?
In return, however, she requires treats.<eos> Last year, it was a violin.<eos> This year?<eos> Five minutes unsupervised conversation... with you.<eos> Me?
Last year, it was a violin.<eos> This year?<eos> Five minutes unsupervised conversation... with you.<eos> Me?<eos> With me?
I won!<eos> I saved Molly Hooper!<eos> Huh!<eos> Saved her?<eos> From what?
Oh, God!<eos> What... what did you do?<eos> ♪ I that am lost ♪<eos> ♪ Oh, who will find me ♪<eos> ♪ Deep down below the old beech tree...?
You told us that our daughter was dead!<eos> Better that than tell you what she had become.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Whatever she became, whatever she is now, Mycroft, she remains our daughter.<eos> And my sister.
- No, no. You should go.<eos> Well, you need a break.<eos> - I'll stay with the baby, and you...<eos> - Maybe the baby should decide. Who do you want to stay with you?<eos> Daddy or Mommy?
Well, you need a break.<eos> - I'll stay with the baby, and you...<eos> - Maybe the baby should decide. Who do you want to stay with you?<eos> Daddy or Mommy?<eos> Or Daddy?
Are you taking over the house?<eos> Yes, you are. Yes, you are.<eos> Trust me, one day you're gonna get to know this little guy... and you are gonna love him with all of your heart.<eos> Just like we do.<eos> All of your heart?
He shall not pass!<eos> It's no use, Wizzie. He's got Mom and Dad completely fooled.<eos> If they knew what I knew, they'd never let him stay.<eos> Perhaps your parents need to be enlightened.<eos> With a great curse!
Are you the Baby Jesus?<eos> Yes. I'm the Baby Jesus.<eos> No!<eos> You see, I'm more middle management for the company.<eos> The company? What company?
It represents all the love there is in the world.<eos> - I love pie.<eos> - Who doesn't?<eos> - Apple. - Fine.<eos> - No, cherry! - Perfect!
You guys stay in the Puppy Zone, okay?<eos> Okay, bye!<eos> That's where we'll find the secret file on the new puppy.<eos> We'll never get through that door.<eos> No, not that door.
Who are the boring directors?<eos> The biggest baby bosses of them all.<eos> I thought they loved me.<eos> But they replaced me with someone new.<eos> Someone younger.
Thank you.<eos> Come quick.<eos> It won't take long.<eos> Who do you miss more?<eos> Mom or dad?
What the hell is he saying?<eos> Stop... guy.<eos> What?<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hey!
Shit.<eos> He's coming.<eos> Hi, baby.<eos> Who you talking to?<eos> Um, Jack.
My shadow is always with me.<eos> Sometimes ahead.<eos> Sometimes behind.<eos> Sometimes to the left. Sometimes to the right.<eos> Except on cloudy days... or at night.
Yes, Coop.<eos> I, too, have missed our good times together.<eos> Where have you been all these years?<eos> Gordon, I've been working undercover all these years, working primarily with our colleague<eos> Phillip Jeffries.
You all right?<eos> I don't know him.<eos> Dougie... come on, pal.<eos> Hey! Look who's back from Bendersville.<eos> With a new haircut.
I want a car. Cheap rental, if you like.<eos> For myself and Ray Monroe.<eos> I want a friend in the glove compartment...<eos> One a.m. tonight.<eos> Smooth and safe.
Uh-huh.<eos> What sort of things do you write about?<eos> Different things.<eos> Approximately two weeks ago, did you write an entry about encountering what you described as an alternate reality?<eos> A different dimension.
And when I take over Gotham City...<eos> Opening reactor core doors.<eos> ...Batman will grovel at the feet of his greatest enemy!<eos> Me!<eos> The Joker!
I just got a couple here.<eos> There. - Is that it? - Yeah.<eos> Oh. Of course.<eos> What about the utility belt? Anything in your cape?<eos> Under your cowl?
This is not a family trip.<eos> I can wear my costume, too.<eos> Well, luckily for us, you left your costume back at the...<eos> - Rip!<eos> - Oh! Nope. Under your clothes.
What?<eos> You're the reason why I get up at 4:00 in the afternoon and pump iron until my chest is positively sick.<eos> You're the reason I've given up a life spent with Russian ballerinas and lady activewear models.<eos> And if it wasn't for you, I never would have learned how connected I am with all these people.<eos> And you.
Joy?<eos> It's Danny.<eos> Danny Rand.<eos> How did you get up here?<eos> uh...
I'm not gonna hurt you.<eos> So... what makes you think Ward tried to kill you?<eos> sounds preposterous.<eos> Your security guy came after me.<eos> With two other guys.
Are you sure?<eos> Very sure.<eos> you seem to have gotten away.<eos> Yeah.<eos> This time.
I stepped out, but the... the snow was so deep, the wind, I...<eos> I kept on falling, and... suddenly I looked up, and... there were these two men standing above me.<eos> Chodak and Tashi.<eos> And who were they?<eos> Monks.
It's the 21st century.<eos> We're all connected.<eos> Chodak and Tashi.<eos> And who were they?<eos> Monks.
Some happier world.<eos> Right after we shot this, we all went to the circus in Madison Square Garden.<eos> I didn't want to do the commercial.<eos> It's how Dad talked me into it.<eos> The circus.
And it's not like he's all that sophisticated.<eos> Make sure to pay for the door repair at the hospital.<eos> And I don't want anyone talking.<eos> what about the pier deal?<eos> Patel?
You dishonor yourself when you fight for money.<eos> There's more at stake here than just your bills.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Are you the one who takes care of these?<eos> The gravestones?
That's pretty close.<eos> He was a good kid.<eos> He was kind.<eos> If you would've told me that one day he would fight off men with axes...<eos> Hatchets.
This is my choice.<eos> I don't know who this guy was or where he came from.<eos> But he could fight.<eos> I'm telling you, he punched through solid metal with his bare hands.<eos> His hands?
Terrible?<eos> Or maybe...<eos> - Good.<eos> Aw, you're worried.<eos> Even about a stranger.
What?<eos> Was I supposed to let her die? What?<eos> What are you saying?<eos> Who were you talking to?<eos> No one.
Radovan.<eos> Oh, Danny.<eos> Danny, I think he...<eos> Danny?<eos> Anzhou...
We didn't used to be like this.<eos> One day, you just put up a wall, and I never understood why.<eos> Did I do something?<eos> I was protecting you.<eos> From what?
I don't have any other option.<eos> She's my only daughter.<eos> the Hand will kill her.<eos> I've been working on something that's going to put an end to all that.<eos> What?
Oh, well, you know, addicts can be... they can be unpredictable.<eos> But we've gotta do everything we can to help him.<eos> Everything.<eos> That shouldn't keep us from getting Rand back... and turning it into what I'd always hoped for.<eos> Our family's legacy.
leave that for, you know, that... that Hogarth and the courts to work out.<eos> I don't want you risking anything.<eos> Where's the risk?<eos> People will ask you questions, and you're... you're gonna wanna answer honestly and truthfully.<eos> Yeah, under oath.
I'm... I'm so sorry, Joy.<eos> I'll clean this up.<eos> Come in.<eos> He's just finished a call, sir.<eos> To whom?
Trying to get me to question everything.<eos> Even you.<eos> In what way?<eos> She implied that this was the Hand.<eos> Bakuto.
Now, I need to get this wound taken care of.<eos> I know someone who can help.<eos> Someone I trust.<eos> That woman who helped you escape the compound, who is she?<eos> No one important.
It's what powers the Iron Fist.<eos> Where does that come from? The Fist?<eos> It's a force that lives in the heart of Shou-Lao until a warrior from the monastery can claim it.<eos> What, or, uh, who is Shou-Lao?<eos> A dragon.
Just stop.<eos> I'm telling you the truth.<eos> How can I ever trust you again?<eos> I am the Iron Fist.<eos> Protector of K'un-Lun.
In order to find you, she had to pretend to be me.<eos> Truthfully, she is the 68th generation descendant of Princess Gitanjali of Magadha.<eos> Princess?<eos> This garden is really big. She lives here by herself?<eos> Wonderful!
Jack, we need you...<eos> Help us use the diamond to solve the mystery of the Magadha treasure.<eos> What's so special about this diamond?<eos> Jiang Wen, could you please explain it to him in Chinese?<eos> My pleasure.
I think these are all she-hyenas.<eos> The females should love... tender fresh meat.<eos> Watch out!<eos> Xiaoguang, behind you...<eos> in front of you!
- What?<eos> - He's in the fucking trash!<eos> - Hold on!<eos> He's in the trash!<eos> Under fire!
- He's in the fucking trash!<eos> - Hold on!<eos> He's in the trash!<eos> Under fire!<eos> Under fire!
I don't know what I expected, but I... I know I couldn't lie to you anymore.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I appreciate that.<eos> Do you miss it?<eos> The suit?
Thanks.<eos> I appreciate that.<eos> Do you miss it?<eos> The suit?<eos> The mask?
Still, after all this time, I... I don't know how I feel about it.<eos> That's the beauty of it.<eos> It can be whatever you need it to be.<eos> What do you need it to be?<eos> Home.
More than once.<eos> And all I want in this life is never to see it again.<eos> But now that we've been brought together... that's not something we need to worry about.<eos> Who?<eos> Who?
The money?<eos> That doesn't define me.<eos> Maybe not, but that kid is sitting in a jail cell tonight and you're not.<eos> - Neither are you.<eos> - Not this time.
Hey! You know nothing about me.<eos> I know enough.<eos> And I know privilege when I see it.<eos> You may think you earned your strength, but you had power the day you were born.<eos> Before the dragons.
- I know who you are.<eos> No, you don't. Trust me.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> You're the Devil of Hell's Kitchen.<eos> Or Devil Boy,
But destiny is a curious thing, because this vessel landed right where it belongs.<eos> With us.<eos> With me.<eos> Who are you?<eos> The Black Sky.
- You know this guy?<eos> - It's complicated.<eos> - Then uncomplicate it.<eos> - He's one of them, aren't you?<eos> - The Hand?
- So?<eos> - Put us through brutal trials.<eos> It's called discipline.<eos> It means he won't crack.<eos> Not by force.
You said so yourself. He got mixed up with the mob or something.<eos> - Wasn't the mob.<eos> - Sorry. Who are you?<eos> - He's a lawyer.<eos> - A what?
Your position is one of great power.<eos> But it is a burden as much as a blessing.<eos> Which is why I've convinced the others to follow your lead.<eos> You and I have always understood each other.<eos> Under a single condition.
Trust me, I'd face a dragon over Jessica Jones any day.<eos> What happened between you two?<eos> We had a moment.<eos> But we both had to go on our different paths, so we...<eos> Different paths?
About what?<eos> About my dad.<eos> A crime-fighting blind lawyer,<eos> I figured there had gotta be a good story there.<eos> Or a shitty one.
Regardless of what has come before, we were meant to fight this war together.<eos> Of course.<eos> Which is why... I wanted your last meal to be a good one.<eos> You came alone... to face me?<eos> Foolish.
'Cause we both know you're not just a lawyer in all this.<eos> You're something more.<eos> As of right now, you're a person of interest.<eos> A witness to a crime.<eos> A witness?
This is where Bailey and Stenton make all of their plans.<eos> It's very serious.<eos> I mean, this is high nerd, right?<eos> Oh, no, you probably shouldn't play with...<eos> With this?
Can you talk about what you did the rest of the weekend?<eos> Nothing, really.<eos> I just... I kayaked.<eos> You kayaked? With who?<eos> Nobody.
Nothing, really.<eos> I just... I kayaked.<eos> You kayaked? With who?<eos> Nobody.<eos> Just on my own.
It's time, Brian.<eos> Here's where things get a little bit tricky.<eos> Um... there's really no easy way to say this, but, um, Mac and I aren't just friends.<eos> - He's actually my, uh...<eos> - Lover. - Partner.
Could you get to me in time?<eos> How would you do it, I wonder?<eos> That woman's pen?<eos> His cane?<eos> Maybe his glasses?
How would you do it, I wonder?<eos> That woman's pen?<eos> His cane?<eos> Maybe his glasses?<eos> My hands.
How come he can cut to the front?<eos> Oh, Ethan is here with a special program for children with leukemia, so he skips to the front of the line.<eos> Thank you!<eos> Coming through.<eos> AIDS!
There's two kind of AIDS... there's the vagina AIDS and then the needle-based AIDS.<eos> I-I'm a vagina guy.<eos> - Well, no, actually my test results show<eos> - I got... sorry, I'm...<eos> AIDS.
- Yeah.<eos> - You get the point.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I got AIDS, AIDS.<eos> - AIDS!
- I got AIDS, AIDS.<eos> - AIDS!<eos> Guy with AIDS, coming through.<eos> AIDS, coming through.<eos> AIDS, AIDS...
- AIDS!<eos> Guy with AIDS, coming through.<eos> AIDS, coming through.<eos> AIDS, AIDS...<eos> - AIDS!
Go.<eos> - My sunglasses.<eos> - Oh, all of our chains!<eos> You know how hard it is to get all of our chains.<eos> - AIDS... - AIDS, AIDS!
My back!<eos> That guy has AIDS!<eos> Aah!<eos> Aah, my back!<eos> AIDS!
- Yeah.<eos> What?<eos> !<eos> What-what are you talking about?<eos> Enough with this.
- Don't bring it up.<eos> Can you walk me through what your guy is again?<eos> Okay, so here's the deal, man.<eos> Who do girls want to have sex with more than anybody else?<eos> - Jugglers.
I'm the boyfriend.<eos> I'm the boss.<eos> What will you have, Chris?<eos> Thanks, Jack.<eos> Another time.
What will you have, Chris?<eos> Thanks, Jack.<eos> Another time.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Another time.
I guess I was waiting for something exceptional.<eos> And then I met you.<eos> Would miss Austen approve of this?<eos> I was being romantic, and then you just go and distract me with your kinky fuckery.<eos> "Kinky fuckery"?
Uh, I just need a minute.<eos> I'll meet you downstairs.<eos> Okay.<eos> Don't forget your mask.<eos> under my skin
Baby skin, baby sting.<eos> Oh, not again.<eos> I hate when this happens.<eos> You guys really suit each other.<eos> The big, bad bedwetters.
Well done.<eos> All right, darling.<eos> Gonna go right round, OK.<eos> All right. Well done. We're nearly done.<eos> OK, just under the tongue.
Trish, after the attack, were you left where it happened, or were you transported somewhere else?<eos> I-I was left there.<eos> How did you get to the police station tonight?<eos> Walk?<eos> Drive?
Sorry.<eos> - How's the homework?<eos> - All done.<eos> I'm gonna hang out in town with the guys for a bit, maybe go round one of their houses.<eos> - "The guys"? Which guys?
- How's the homework?<eos> - All done.<eos> I'm gonna hang out in town with the guys for a bit, maybe go round one of their houses.<eos> - "The guys"? Which guys?<eos> - Over there.
Antiope thinks I'm ready.<eos> Does she?<eos> I could begin showing her some things.<eos> She should at least be able to defend herself.<eos> From whom?
Not right now!<eos> Trevor, what the hell were you thinking bringing a woman into the counsel?<eos> The Intel that I brought back is time sensitive.<eos> This is one of Dr.. Maru's notebooks.<eos> Notebook or notes...
The villagers!<eos> What they cheering for?<eos> Diana!<eos> What did they fire?<eos> The gas.
Where's Stefan?<eos> Stefan's gone, skipper.<eos> Why?<eos> Says he won't put to sea in a deathtrap.<eos> A deathtrap.
Well.<eos> They nearly killed him.<eos> Is Eric the sheriff now?<eos> Do you think Eric would make a good sheriff?<eos> 'A good sheriff or a baaad sheriff'.
It's kind of like the new Studio 54.<eos> Like Studio 54?<eos> !<eos> - Kind of. - Girl...<eos> More dirtier.
- I can dig it.<eos> - I'm not fucking asking you, man.<eos> Boo come around, turn him back. That's it.<eos> All right.<eos> Don Corleone shit.
I'm sorry.<eos> I'm gonna get dressed now.<eos> Okay. I'm fine.<eos> Darling, Misty Holloway was all wrong about you.<eos> - Fearless.
- Fearless.<eos> - Five-by-ten portraits, black and white.<eos> Wink twice if you enjoy cocaine.<eos> No?<eos> What about Quaaludes?
- Francisco.<eos> - Coño. What is this?<eos> Silence.<eos> I don't want to speak to you.<eos> Only to Lydia.
So, I beat that bitch unconscious, Books.<eos> You did what?<eos> Beat that bitch unconscious.<eos> She wanted to replace me with a band.<eos> - A band?
The only person's behavior we can control is our own.<eos> And two, the only thing we can truly give another person is information, so let me give you some.<eos> You see this cameras in here?<eos> The moment you make a move, highly paid men with weapons, will make there way into this room.<eos> With one very... specific instruction.
Yeah, little dude says we should.<eos> Why are you listening to the little dude?<eos> He's dating our sister.<eos> How many sisters do you have?<eos> Only one.
Fetch two glasses.<eos> They should have invited you. To the wake, at least.<eos> Serving stew in the backroom, to hell with that.<eos> In all of this dirty city, there is no-one that I can trust, do you understand?<eos> Apart from you.
Felice Adventurero sold for Â£800 to...?<eos> The Delaney Nootka Trading Company.<eos> I spoke to old Grady afterwards.<eos> He said Delaney told him he was going to use the ship for trade.<eos> With whom?
And that's why you don't rent her.<eos> Am I wrong?<eos> I would rather that you worked with me rather than against me.<eos> Work at what?<eos> Necessary evil.
I am looking for a particular document.<eos> A treaty. That is all.<eos> A treaty between my father and the Nootka Indian tribe.<eos> A treaty in which Nootka land was bought for gunpowder... and lies!<eos> Along with my mother.
You witnessed the division of the gunpowder and you heard its destination.<eos> Yes, I did, sir.<eos> And you were both being paid for your services by James Keziah Delaney himself?<eos> In gold.<eos> And silver.
You sleep here?<eos> I saw you.<eos> I saw you do for the Malay.<eos> And like a wolf you tore out his heart, and then threw him into the river.<eos> Splash.
Very vilely in the morning when he's sober and most vilely in the afternoon when he's drunk.<eos> When he's best he's little worse than a man, and when he's worst he's little better than a beast.<eos> - Hurry up!<eos> - Vestris!<eos> Vestris!
- Vestris!<eos> Vestris!<eos> Hey! Hey! If you're here just for a wank, pull your pudding and get it over with and let the rest of us enjoy Shakespeare!<eos> You can't fetch up until you bring Vestris!<eos> Vestris! Vestris!
He missed Sonny Jim's birthday party, which we'd been planning for six months, and then he shows up straight from the casino.<eos> You know about his gambling problems and then the drinking, and the drinking feeds the gambling and vice versa, and the whole thing is just a downward spiral.<eos> Dougie, have you been exercising?<eos> Exercising. You have lost a good amount of weight, also.<eos> - Also.
- We fire her, - she's got no place to go.<eos> Here he is.<eos> What the fuck were you guys talking about?<eos> She was talking.<eos> - Candie?
What the fuck were you guys talking about?<eos> She was talking.<eos> - Candie?<eos> What were you talking about to him out there on the floor?<eos> Candie!
Yes, sir.<eos> You have an enemy in Douglas Jones.<eos> That's what I came to tell you.<eos> Candie, show him out.<eos> Candie!
Dougie.<eos> Here's to the pie that saved your life, dougie.<eos> And our money.<eos> Candie.<eos> Candie.
No, you'll be the one to tell her.<eos> Ignore the strange man.<eos> - Here's to the bureau.<eos> - To the bureau.<eos> To the bureau.
Where's Angela?<eos> I haven't got a clue.<eos> She was supposed to show last night.<eos> She didn't show then either.<eos> Clark?
- Do it!<eos> Oh... - Hey. - It's okay.<eos> I got you, I got you, I got you...<eos> The plan was to be you.<eos> With Wren.
It's about Toby, isn't it?<eos> He settled for Yvonne.<eos> We both know that.<eos> And now he's free to be with his one true love.<eos> Me.
Charlotte.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> It's crazy, right?<eos> - They're identical...<eos> - Twins.
It's a mixture of cross-pollinational collation...<eos> Admiral Simon Ball was Glen's public affairs officer.<eos> - Cooperational, cooperative...<eos> - For three and a half years, he'd been trying to explain SNORPP to the Washington press gallery.<eos> ...with a centralized command centralization structure, and... things like that.
- Whoever said what, a troop surge and an election don't sit well together, so this is the way it's gotta be.<eos> I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing in the meantime.<eos> I have a strategy. I'm ready to execute.<eos> The suggestion now seems to be that I thumb twiddle.<eos> With all due respect, Madam Secretary...
Put the bag down.<eos> I assume that was a joke.<eos> My name is Captain Badi Bassim.<eos> I'm here to start work with General McMahon.<eos> - Who?
I assume that was a joke.<eos> My name is Captain Badi Bassim.<eos> I'm here to start work with General McMahon.<eos> - Who?<eos> - McMahon.
- Abby is Chloe's half-sister, so we just... - Right.<eos> Of course.<eos> Just have Nathan call me.<eos> Can I have a word with you for a second?<eos> Um, yes. Just... just one.
It would be the greatest honor of my life.<eos> Let's go!<eos> Come on! Send him a text.<eos> That's my sister! That's my sister!<eos> Enough!
- Yeah. I thought you were mad at me. No.<eos> My grandma and I know you did nothing wrong.<eos> Good. I was worried that your grandma would be up in arms about us being friends.<eos> Get it?<eos> Up in arms.
My God, we don't need a counselor.<eos> Couples fight.<eos> You telling me you and Perry don't ever fight?<eos> No, we do.<eos> Sometimes.
No, no!<eos> So, what's the plan then?<eos> I'm goin' through the portal.<eos> - Who's Peter?<eos> - My dad.
So far, the only thing I know about Canaan is where it is.<eos> That's all we need to know.<eos> Scott, Malia and Lydia are going out to Canaan.<eos> He said to go through with the plan as long as it doesn't destroy his house.<eos> What plan?
Tell me, how would you control this unstoppable army?<eos> How do you stop the unstoppable?<eos> How is your Kampfgruppe going to stop them?<eos> Tell us. How are you going to perform this miracle?<eos> With German efficiency.
Try to find him in your memories. - STILES:<eos> You have something, Scott.<eos> Whether you want it or not, you can do things that nobody else can do.<eos> Find him in any memory.<eos> Good or bad. STILES:
Listen, I remember something.<eos> At the start of the year, Stiles was trying to find a place for you guys to live after graduation.<eos> He said you were getting an apartment together?<eos> And I remember saying something to Stiles. Something like it's not always a good idea to live with your friends.<eos> Even your best friend.
My name is Alice Vaughan.<eos> - You're a cop?<eos> - Private investigator.
Not very often.<eos> He was always good to me.<eos> That makes one of us.<eos> But now you're with Christopher.<eos> Ben.
I used to walk their dogs.<eos> - How'd they find you?<eos> - Craigslist, I think.<eos> And how'd they pay you?<eos> Cash usually, sometimes a check.
Yeah, those earrings weren't for Alice.<eos> I wasn't aware that your date with Tommy was a secret.<eos> - You slut-shamed me...<eos> - No, I did not!<eos> In front of my bosses.
- With a dinner party.<eos> - A dinner party?<eos> - Well, not just any dinner party.<eos> The most exclusive dinner party in Los Angeles...<eos> One night only.
- Because I don't know you.<eos> Well, you saved me, so how does that work?<eos> No. I'm a nurse.<eos> That's what I do.<eos> - What?
It's a boy. It's just a... a sweet, sweet boy. Who's prone to hysterics.<eos> Who you keep locked up.<eos> Why do you think I live in a town with no name? A place on no map?<eos> It's to protect him.<eos> From what?
You let him do this to you.<eos> No one does anything to me.<eos> I will... if you get this wrong. I will.<eos> Which do you think I am?<eos> A murderer or a traitor?
You had no right to help me!<eos> I take on many special projects for the Royal Army.<eos> This is what they pay me to do.<eos> So that's what I am?<eos> A project?
Definitely strange, but... kind of interesting strange.<eos> Who is she?<eos> Her name is Langwidere.<eos> Is she a friend of yours?<eos> Uh, a client.
Who are you?<eos> Jack. We met at the palace.<eos> And how do you know my Langwidere?<eos> Well, I'm her...<eos> Property.
Not much for conversation, is she?<eos> This is the woman who killed your sister.<eos> I trust you will be fair.<eos> Fair with you.<eos> Yes. Not so much with her.
Can you give me that key?<eos> Come on.<eos> You don't recognize me, do you?<eos> I was the boy you saved.<eos> From Mombi.
The ones our sister died with.<eos> If secrets were kept, they were kept from me, too.<eos> And what of your own?<eos> I harbor no secrets.<eos> Especially from you.
I'm sorry, father, I'll...<eos> I'll come and help you find him.<eos> You know I'm always here for you.<eos> Lady ev, can you commit to my cause?<eos> With this?
Because you knew it was something we could never share.<eos> Because I was...<eos> I was neither with you... nor with her.<eos> Two years ago, when you traded your old life for a new one with me, we promised to keep our secrets from the world.<eos> But never from each other.
Let them know how it tastes.<eos> But they aren't who we came for.<eos> Where is he? The wizard.<eos> Gone to ev.<eos> With our army.
You're gonna have to kill me.<eos> If you stay here, I won't have to, because glinda will.<eos> Or the beast forever.<eos> But if you go back, frank, you can at least live your life.<eos> What life?
I've been lied to my whole life.<eos> This isn't a lie.<eos> How do I know?<eos> When you were little, I gave you a tattoo on your left hand.<eos> Just below your thumb.
There must be.<eos> With our numbers, our ability to search outside Nassau town is limited.<eos> Without any sense of where to look...<eos> And what about informants?<eos> Informants?
Bose changed his strategy and joined hands with the enemy of the enemy, Japan.<eos> He assumed command of the Indian National Army in Singapore.<eos> The Indian National Army or INA. Was formed with prisoners of war who were captured while fighting for the British.<eos> But the British Army still had thousands of Indian soldiers who are shedding their blood for their ruthless masters, the British.<eos> Nawab!
Left, right, left.<eos> Hold my waist.<eos> Why so shy, Sergeant?<eos> You've seen me naked.<eos> Stark naked.
Oye Nawab, you dog..<eos> You're alive?<eos> It'll take a lot more to kill me!<eos> Hello everybody!<eos> Ahuja!
I'd have saved him.<eos> Explained to him that the INA is with monsters like the Japanese, Hitler, Mussolini".<eos> It's easy to see those monsters.<eos> But what about the monster that lives here?<eos> The British.
You know, I have an appointment I need to get ready for.<eos> Right. Yeah, me too.<eos> I got to go visit LT.<eos> Who's LT?<eos> Just a mutual friend.
Who's David Barton?<eos> That was the guard that was being held at gunpoint when TJ jumped, who's now MIA.<eos> That's brutal.<eos> His boyfriend was being held hostage by chance?<eos> Not by chance. No way.
- Okay.<eos> - Can you do me a favor?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Is there double-stitching on the side with a banana grundle?<eos> A banana grundle?
Look, we're becoming friends, and I don't wanna make you uncomfortable.<eos> But that girl that was leaving your apartment...<eos> Yeah.<eos> I just hope that you're not preying on girls with low self-esteem to feed your addiction.<eos> Low self-esteem?
How's your body?<eos> Don't lie.<eos> Yes.<eos> Photographic evidence?<eos> Fuck, yeah.
You fucked up this whole case and when I called your captain to find out where you were, she told me she hadn't heard from you since you initiated a sexual exchange with her at 1:00 a.m.<eos> That was my bad. That was on me.<eos> - That was an accident.<eos> - You fucking pervert!<eos> Just goddamn nasty!
I'm so proud of this guy.<eos> - Get it, Jon. Get it. - Oof.<eos> We should be good though.<eos> Yeah. Be classy.<eos> Always classy.
- Yeah.<eos> - Convenient.<eos> Can't be traced.<eos> Care to hazard a time of death, Doctor?<eos> Er... between six and seven this morning.
I'd rather not be mistaken for a madam.<eos> It's Barbara Barga, New York Times.<eos> Have you been in London long?<eos> I arrived ten days ago on the inaugural Lufthansa flight.<eos> With Goebbels and Goering.
You know too much now to be allowed to stay uncommitted.<eos> Like I said, I've seen a thousand guys like this all over the world.<eos> If it came to choosing between your life and a chance to get US government recognition of the Connolly set-up, do you think they would hesitate for one moment?<eos> Can I use your phone?<eos> CID duty officer.
After we fight, we-- Ahem, we very often make love.<eos> I don't know if you can call it making love.<eos> It's very-- Um, there seems to be a lot of anger, You know, mixed up in it, and...<eos> Well, there's a line between passion and-- And rage, and... And, you know, sometimes maybe we--<eos> Sometimes.
That was it.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> But he gave me my ziggy, so...<eos> Have you talked to anybody about this?<eos> Like a therapist or a counselor or someone?
I don't know if you're getting these messages, but I figured out the mark on Julia's hand.<eos> It's braille. I'm gonna come find you guys.<eos> Our souls are eternal, and when we die, the spirit strives to find a new home.<eos> I'm telling you, she's coming back.<eos> This time for real.
No.<eos> Your dimple?<eos> I don't have dimples!<eos> Your hair.<eos> Friends!
Bang. Worst has already happened.<eos> You get a few days to let it sink in, and then you're riding the cart on the way to do your dance on nothing.<eos> This country went to hell when they stopped hanging folks.<eos> No gallows dirt, no gallows deals.<eos> No gallows humor.
Worship me.<eos> Stay here... with your words... with your body.<eos> Worship me.<eos> Pray to me like I'm your god.<eos> Your goddess.
We don't have a bargain.<eos> Of course we do.<eos> I won the toss.<eos> You work for me now. You're my aide-de-camp.<eos> My castellan.
It'll be heads.<eos> Well, if it's coin tricks we're doing... watch this.<eos> Now that's a coin trick for you.<eos> How'd you do it?<eos> With panache.
And you're no Jesus Christ.<eos> Are you still working for the man?<eos> I was. About that, we have a problem here.<eos> A...<eos> A problem with me? Oh, no.
You're doing a hell of a job.<eos> We're trying.<eos> You and I, let's hunt some deer this fall, like old times.<eos> Okay?<eos> Truvio.
- Who do you work for?<eos> - If you allow me to do my job, maybe you'll...<eos> I want to know who you are.<eos> I want to know the Reese behind the smile, the handshake.<eos> The sterile white bullshit.
Owens won in front of Hitler. Yeah, what a moment.<eos> What a moment.<eos> I mean, Hitler's up there with all his perfect Aryan race bullshit.<eos> This black dude comes along, proves him wrong in front of the entire world.<eos> Amazing.
With your natural gifts and our determination, we could both be part of something greater.<eos> Something perfect.<eos> The Coagula procedure is a man-made miracle.<eos> Our order has been developing it for many, many years, and it wasn't until recently it was perfected<eos> by my own flesh and blood.
What the fuck?<eos> Hello, Mr...<eos> Uh, Williams.<eos> Rod Williams.<eos> From the TSA?
Phase two is this. Mental preparation.<eos> It's basically psychological pre-op.<eos> Pre-op?<eos> For phase three.<eos> The transplantation. Well, partial, actually.
The piece of your brain connected to your nervous system needs to stay put, keeping those intricate connections intact.<eos> So you won't be gone, not completely.<eos> A sliver of you will still be in there, somewhere, limited consciousness.<eos> You'll be able to see and hear what your body is doing, but your existence will be as a passenger.<eos> An audience.
The Sunken Place.<eos> Now you're in the Sunken Place.<eos> Yeah. That's what she calls it.<eos> Now, I'll control the motor functions, so I'll be...<eos> Me.
I could be Mr. Wednesday with a shake of the handed.<eos> How much has our man told you?<eos> You're my man now. Do you know who he is?<eos> Who he really is?<eos> _
- Uh, you're a cook?<eos> - I try.<eos> He's an amazing cook.<eos> And he was a medic in the army in Afghanistan for three years.<eos> A medic?
Serene nights.<eos> - Can I ask you something?<eos> Will mentioned what happened to your mom earlier.<eos> That she killed herself?<eos> Not exactly.
I would live a life filled... engulfed... consumed... by lust.<eos> - You would?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Engulfed? Consumed.<eos> With lust?
And so that means not everybody can get to you to shoot you or. Not everybody could get to you to have sex with you.<eos> Otherwise, why would you buy the video?<eos> The video has to be the only place they can get it or it won't sell.<eos> My free time, I like to spend shopping.<eos> With my son.
Sucks.<eos> You talk to her? Yeah.<eos> I mean, you know, like, a little.<eos> Yeah, me too.<eos> A little.
Oh, hi, Mrs. Baker.<eos> Yeah, she was totally just helping me with it.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> What are you working on?<eos> Uh, math.
Did you get to first base, Justin?<eos> Get off me, I'm not saying anything.<eos> - Second?<eos> - Fuck off.<eos> Third?
How early did you have to get up?<eos> Yesterday?<eos> We won't do the full spread every day, but it's nice to start off right.<eos> So, how'd your project end up last night?<eos> With Tony.
What is depicted on the giant painting they just hung on that wall?<eos> It's a... giant bleeding man?<eos> Or squid?<eos> Or man-squid.<eos> In spring.
You look good.<eos> Who'd you come here with?<eos> Oh, just Courtney.<eos> And her court.<eos> The Courtnettes.
For mix tapes, of course.<eos> A lost and essential art.<eos> What's this?<eos> That starts with the song you and Clay danced to.<eos> The slow one.
Until the Dollar Valentines offer same-sex options for match-making, I will continue to take them on.<eos> He's really serious about the 'zine.<eos> He's serious about the 'zine, his shoes, and not much else.<eos> What are you working on?<eos> Oh, nothing.
Nice.<eos> How may I help you, sir?<eos> Uh... Hey, Skye.<eos> Um, Triple Americano, and a double mocha with extra little chocolate sprinkles.<eos> Extra little chocolate sprinkles.
He said you'd been following him.<eos> He's just a little out of his head lately.<eos> Too much caffeine.<eos> That's the kid who keeps texting you?<eos> Uh... one of them, yeah.
As usual, we begin by reminding everyone poetry is about honest expression.<eos> And we all need to feel safe to share our deepest truths.<eos> Nice to see a friendly face.<eos> Friendly?<eos> Familiar?
Or you'll slip.<eos> What?<eos> Come on, are you a man or not?<eos> Not!<eos> Most definitely not.
Trust me.<eos> So that guy Brad... is he your boyfriend now?<eos> I hope he's still my boyfriend.<eos> He's been pretty annoyed lately because... I've been spending all my time with another guy.<eos> You.
Tell someone.<eos> That night did not happen the way Hannah said.<eos> Then how did it happen?<eos> I hooked up with my boyfriend.<eos> - With Justin.
Then how did it happen?<eos> I hooked up with my boyfriend.<eos> - With Justin.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> With Justin.
What do you want, Marcus?<eos> Did you and Tony talk yesterday?<eos> We sure did.<eos> Okay, and you're just... doing your own thing.<eos> Oh, more than ever.
- Jeff's a good influence on you. - You think?<eos> I mean, he got you to go to a party.<eos> You've done that before.<eos> I guess I have.<eos> But not this time.
Something came up here.<eos> Something... with Hannah's case?<eos> I'll tell you later if I can.<eos> There's leftover chicken in the fridge, and roast beef for sandwiches.<eos> Lainie.
But it's strictly coincidental.<eos> If it's strictly coincidental, then why is he watching us?<eos> I mean, he does take an interest in my social life.<eos> Uh-huh. So... you tutor him in academics, and he tutors you in...<eos> Girls.
If it's strictly coincidental, then why is he watching us?<eos> I mean, he does take an interest in my social life.<eos> Uh-huh. So... you tutor him in academics, and he tutors you in...<eos> Girls.<eos> Girl.
I mean, he does take an interest in my social life.<eos> Uh-huh. So... you tutor him in academics, and he tutors you in...<eos> Girls.<eos> Girl.<eos> Singular.
- Reunite with Hannah forever?<eos> - Fuck you, Tony.<eos> You think you could have changed anything?<eos> What does that make you?<eos> God?
But... how are you?<eos> How the fuck do you think?<eos> Do you need to... talk to somebody?<eos> See somebody?<eos> Who?
But the things I've done in the pursuit of it... were intended to honor my oath.<eos> But somehow, here I am now.<eos> What I've just done... there's no coming back from that.<eos> There is no difference between Flint and Silver now.<eos> Or between Flint and any of them.
As long as you and she stand for it... as long as the treasure powers it... nothing can stop it from beginning now.<eos> Nothing but you.<eos> Why would you want to do that?<eos> This is what it would be.<eos> Time after time after time.
Oh, hi, Cath.<eos> Sorry about your party.<eos> I had to work late, and by the time we got back your lights wereout.<eos> Everyone was knackered, so it wasn't a late one.<eos> Another time maybe? - Yeah.
Then I'd outgrow them and bounce.<eos> The sex was just for fun.<eos> When the world's over, everyone should be getting their rocks off.<eos> Was that how it was with him?<eos> Abraham?
If they'd have just waited one more day...<eos> Well, Sasha's a good shot, and Rosita knows how to take care of herself.<eos> Least I hope so. We're gonna need 'em.<eos> There's a whole lot of people still got to die.<eos> ♪♪
[Sighs] Look, Tara, if you take our guns, you might as well be killing us all.<eos> That's what you'll be doing. We should talk to them.<eos> No.<eos> We can try to stop this.<eos> No, Cyndie.
Rosita: Because I don't trust him.<eos> But I trust Daryl.<eos> Negan's coming soon.<eos> Tomorrow.<eos> Three trucks probably.
We live!<eos> We're the ones!<eos> Us!<eos> You just lost somebody important to you right now...<eos> like, just now.
Right. Jay, you never, never walk into a property with a client if you don't know what's on the other side of that door, right?<eos> Yes, sir. Okay.<eos> What time was the showing?<eos> 9:00 a.m. 9:00 a.m. What time did you get there?<eos> - About 9:00.
You're out of shape.<eos> Yeah. Ohh.<eos> I had a few last night.<eos> With who?<eos> Friends.
Yeah. Ohh.<eos> I had a few last night.<eos> With who?<eos> Friends.<eos> What friends, huh?
I had a few last night.<eos> With who?<eos> Friends.<eos> What friends, huh?<eos> Female friends?
There's plenty of food in the kitchen.<eos> You can help yourself to whatever you want as long as there's nobody's name on it.<eos> And if there's anything special you want for snacks, put it on the list on the fridge.<eos> Is this where I do my shows?<eos> Sometimes.
You want pizza?<eos> Sure.<eos> Word.<eos> Who do you want to fight?<eos> Uh... Hughes.
Fuckin' Hughes is a prick.<eos> You know that.<eos> He's always been a prick.<eos> You were on that medication for a long time.<eos> Lexapro?
I'm... new to Los Angeles.<eos> Ryan, was kind enough to invite me here.<eos> We're blessed to have you, brother.<eos> What vice does the devil tempt you with?<eos> Women.
Ryan, was kind enough to invite me here.<eos> We're blessed to have you, brother.<eos> What vice does the devil tempt you with?<eos> Women.<eos> The wrong women.
Nate got offered a fight.<eos> CFL.<eos> - When?<eos> - Saturday.<eos> With who?
The club we in.<eos> The dues are a motherfucker, but they gotta be paid.<eos> What'd Alvey say?<eos> He said I'm lucky I didn't break my hand.<eos> - Really?
Didn't matter how cold it was.<eos> Dead of winter, there'd be a couple guys there.<eos> And I fought 'em, one at a time.<eos> I fought 'em.<eos> Grown men.
- Here we go. - Nice and loose, Nate.<eos> - Nice and relaxed.<eos> - Whoo! - Love it.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> Nice and relaxed.
Fine, but I'm driving.<eos> As an excuse to strip away our freedom.<eos> Huh? What are you... What are you doing?<eos> Grandpa Rick must have some secret lab, right?<eos> With, like, laser guns and jets packs and a space tank!
But this is actual food, and this would nourish you.<eos> And this... it's just paper that only has value to me.<eos> Unless my suffering is your nourishment?<eos> Jesus.<eos> Loser.
Drunk Rick's point is that none of you are very special or different.<eos> That's always his point.<eos> Let's just get through this as quickly as possible.<eos> Then we'll deal with the two of you.<eos> The two of us?
It was last year for Pete's sake.<eos> I met him at the Shriner's.<eos> Sure, okay then. Everything went great when we met with the broker,<eos> Mr. Ehrmantraut, if I'm not a...<eos> Right, Rick Ehrmantraut.
And you got that putter's instinct for when to drop the Marie Applebaum Discovery Play.<eos> That's true.<eos> You're the hand and I'm the glove.<eos> You're the bottle and I'm the beer.<eos> Or the beer and the glass in my case.
Don't wanna say too much on the phone just...<eos> You better come down here.<eos> Everything okay?<eos> Gotta go to the office, Hun.<eos> Hun?
Investment.<eos> One more time?<eos> Well you called it a loan, it wasn't a loan, it was an investment.<eos> We are investors.<eos> Investors?
No but...<eos> Then why talk about ending something that's only just begun.<eos> See now, the document we signed last year...<eos> When we met with your broker.<eos> Mr. Ehrmantraut.
So the thinking is absorb the local precinct into the larger county force.<eos> Leaving you jack shit.<eos> Language?<eos> No, I'd still be highest ranking local officer just not...<eos> Chief.
What?<eos> Just saying. Y'know. Bit of background.<eos> Right.<eos> Do you want to do it?<eos> With me. Now. It.
Maybe.<eos> I don't know, I suppose.<eos> All of us what?<eos> I'm a shaman.<eos> A shaman?
I'm a shaman.<eos> A shaman?<eos> Like a witch doctor?<eos> No.<eos> Not like a witch doctor.
A spirit healer.<eos> Communes with the spirits.<eos> Walks among the dead.<eos> Heals the sick.<eos> Sometimes.
I'm sorry, I think you're mistaken. I'm not...<eos> I seen you.<eos> Before. Before you was Long.<eos> Now... they say you're supposed to be a pirate king.<eos> A strongman.
No one is leaving anything.<eos> We came here to take Nassau.<eos> We leave once that is done or not at all.<eos> Take Nassau?<eos> With what army?
And I began with the captain.<eos> I was more deliberate with him.<eos> It took some time.<eos> Then I moved to his first mate.<eos> The gun captains.
Noah's a little shy like his dad.<eos> My friends, I've got that feeling again, so if something does happen on October 14th... you've all come to the right place.<eos> - Amen to that.<eos> Amen to that. - Hallelujah.<eos> Hallelujah!
- Bye. - Bye.<eos> Hey, Chief.<eos> A guy just came in and says he needs to talk to you.<eos> Is he Tinfoil Hat or a Kenneth?<eos> Neither.
Jeez.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Hey, Chief.
We dropped a 200-pound AC on an ex-con, and, yeah, it looks like the cover-up's working, but there's a long way to go before we're out of the woods here.<eos> What the heck?<eos> There's something wrong with your chi.<eos> The what's that?<eos> Like, your energy flow.
About when I called before, asked you to look up that fella, Thaddeus Mobley, lived here in the 1970s? Right. Yes.<eos> No, of course.<eos> Yeah, I... I checked on that. Nothing came up.<eos> So, he was, what?<eos> Like, your dad?
Let me call him again.<eos> I feel that maybe we started poorly.<eos> Jesus, it's dinnertime.<eos> Pork chops.<eos> With applesauce, but...
I've studied your books, and, uh, you're not just in the parking lot business anymore.<eos> What business am I in?<eos> The billionaire business.<eos> But first you need to tell me, uh, is your brother going to be a problem?<eos> Ray?
But first you need to tell me, uh, is your brother going to be a problem?<eos> Ray?<eos> No, he...<eos> It's just a dumb rivalry.<eos> And the girl?
Associate in what capacity?<eos> Ladies shoes.<eos> We'll come back to that.<eos> Mr. Stussy, have you seen your brother recently?<eos> - My...
Ladies shoes.<eos> We'll come back to that.<eos> Mr. Stussy, have you seen your brother recently?<eos> - My...<eos> - Raymond.
A meeting, a dinner.<eos> Which is it, a meeting or a dinner?<eos> Uh, dinner.<eos> With whom?<eos> - Sy.
And then, I don't know, maybe the brother came back at him hard.<eos> Maybe not the brother.<eos> Meaning?<eos> Follow the money. That's all I'll say.<eos> The money? What money?
I'm gonna visit you after the holiday, bring you some pie.<eos> Maybe we can talk about Ray. What he liked, who he was.<eos> Coconut.<eos> I like coconut cream pie.<eos> With chocolate flakes on top.
No.<eos> Just whiskey.<eos> Make it a double. And one for my friend.<eos> Just this much. Sherry.<eos> Shartis?
Whatever past disagreements, bygones.<eos> You know? Think of Jesus, His actions.<eos> So, there's bad blood between you and Mr. Feltz?<eos> - No, I wouldn't say...<eos> - What about between you and...
But you can't agitate while it rises, otherwise... Poof.<eos> It's...<eos> He knows it's not Sy, that this isn't...<eos> He just wants to protect me.<eos> From success?
Well, fuck, yes.<eos> Sergeant Kessler.<eos> Sir.<eos> Citizen filed a complaint this morning.<eos> Pretty serious.
And the Lord himself was sent from heaven with a shout.<eos> With a sound from an archangel, and with the voice of God!<eos> Can you hear him?<eos> Come on, worship him.<eos> Hallelujah!
You?<eos> You're made to make some woman happy.<eos> Then marry me.<eos> - Don't be an animal.<eos> - An animal? Me?
Naomi: Am I bothering you? (Spits) Yeah.<eos> I was just, um...<eos> Organizing all my stuff here.<eos> Then I realized... I don't have any stuff.<eos> This thing with you and Amos...
- All: Mmc! Till the rains fall hard on Olympus mons,<eos> - who are we?<eos> - All: Mmc!<eos> - I can't hear you!<eos> - All:
So he's there, he's tearing us a new one.<eos> Meanwhile, the whole room stinks like cheese farts.<eos> - (Clears throat)<eos> - I think I know that governor. Teddy the detector, this guy was not!<eos> Who?
That's right.<eos> Well, you can guess how I feel about your advice.<eos> I'm an old spy, Madame.<eos> I trust old friends.<eos> New ones?
And there's been no one since?<eos> No.<eos> I wish you could stay for Shabbat.<eos> Both boys come with their wives and all the children.<eos> Maybe next time.
The Israelis are gonna pick him up.<eos> Pick him up?<eos> Ask him about his travels.<eos> Tell me this, Dar.<eos> Off the record, just you and me.
How should the Agency proceed?<eos> - Max, everything okay?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - How's he doing?<eos> - Quinn?
Steel City Gang.<eos> His crew.<eos> All of them now in federal prison on drug charges.<eos> Everyone except for the confidential informant who put them all away.<eos> Confidential informant?
- Wha... - Where are the baby wipes?<eos> Right there in front of him.<eos> Huggies. White wrapper.<eos> Right there.<eos> Right there, right in front of you.
No, before that.<eos> Uh, you got into an altercation at the hospital yesterday, and we agreed it might be a good idea for you to come live here for a little while.<eos> No.<eos> Before that.<eos> Before... before this.
Don't you think we should've had this conversation before you did the deal with Conlin?<eos> A win is a win, Reda.<eos> Can't we just leave it at that?<eos> Maybe.<eos> This time.
Tell me.<eos> I was in Abu Dhabi two days ago.<eos> I met an Iranian there.<eos> - Farhad Nafisi.<eos> - The banker?
No dinner guests, unexpected visitors?<eos> Just us.<eos> Saul didn't step out for a few hours, did he?<eos> Take a walk under the stars?<eos> At 4 in the morning?
He was doing what he could to keep her safe.<eos> Do you think that Franny felt safe?<eos> I'm sure she was frightened, but she's a strong girl.<eos> There's something I want to share with you. What?<eos> During our conversation,
_<eos> _ _ _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _ _
No loose ends.<eos> You taught me that, Saul.<eos> Come on. Help me put him in the trunk.<eos> Where is he?<eos> Down by the lake.
Dar Adal.<eos> That's who got Javadi to change his story in the first place.<eos> You know, he sat right there earlier today and lied to me about this all over again, that obsequious little shit!<eos> What is it with you people?<eos> The "intelligence community."
That year, from here to here, I spent smoking meth and masturbating.<eos> What sent you into this tailspin?<eos> Can you tell me that?<eos> I was... working.<eos> Overseas.
Anything.<eos> Just get me out of here.<eos> Tell me what you know about Peter Quinn.<eos> Peter who?<eos> Quinn.
- Madam President-elect.<eos> - Rob.<eos> - Joint Chiefs are already here.<eos> - What about breakfast?<eos> Between Agriculture and Housing and Urban Development.
This is the time.<eos> You're my friend.<eos> You came to take care of me.<eos> I see that now.<eos> Friend? Yes.
You're my friend.<eos> You came to take care of me.<eos> I see that now.<eos> Friend? Yes.<eos> Friend.
Quinn saved my life.<eos> It never occurred to either of you this guy could have been a major witness?<eos> We still have the van.<eos> Show me.<eos> Incredible.
You wanna tell us what you did?<eos> Fell off the stage.<eos> Um... let's take a look here, shall we?<eos> So, Dustin, you're a... dancer?<eos> Stripper. Yeah.
It's to my doctor, isn't it?<eos> I saw you two at the dinner.<eos> You know, the first time we were supposed to get married, I, um... well, we got into a car accident, and I ended up in a coma for eight months.<eos> And when I woke up, I could talk to, um...<eos> Dead people?

But what guarantee do we have that he will not steal Alfred's silver?<eos> None.<eos> But that's the risk we have to take.<eos> Have you been stealing from Alfred, Father Beocca?<eos> Uhtred!
Something for you, huh?<eos> Horsemen approaching!<eos> Hello!<eos> It is my friend, the silver monk.<eos> And with guests.
Horsemen approaching!<eos> Hello!<eos> It is my friend, the silver monk.<eos> And with guests.<eos> And a woman.
Still, they took their man.<eos> We find the slave. We find the lepers.<eos> And we find the priest.<eos> Together, they will tell us all we need to know about this horseman.<eos> Dead... or otherwise.
My son wanted to be an anchorman on the news.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> And did he?<eos> - Nah. He's a cop.<eos> A good one.
On October the 14th, a town in the outback lost its entire population.<eos> A small town, only 14 people.<eos> But all of them vanished, even the animals.<eos> Every living thing in that town was gone except for one thing...<eos> An egg.
Know that you gave your life... For something greater than yourself.<eos> Come on!<eos> Shit!<eos> Help.<eos> Hey there.
Stop!<eos> Go home, Miss Durst.<eos> This isn't for you.<eos> George.<eos> George Brevity.
- I... we need to call Laurie.<eos> - What? I told her I would come back here and we would call her.<eos> When did you talk to Laurie?<eos> - I needed help.<eos> - With what?
No law can govern the lioness.<eos> And as for you fellas, there's only one rule, so learn it well.<eos> When midnight comes, let no man mention his name lest that man become him.<eos> Who's him?<eos> Frasier.
Fortunately, I will play the part of Peter.<eos> You are already John.<eos> What about you, kid?<eos> You wanna be Simon, Bartholomew?<eos> Pass.
You're gonna have to hold me down.<eos> You all right, sir?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I need to talk to the Australian prime minister.<eos> - Sorry?
Important to me.<eos> After you fled, the pirates sent warnings to the other estates that... any violence done to the slaves in their possession for what happened here would be answered.<eos> The next morning, an answer was left by the gate.<eos> A sack filled with fingers.<eos> White fingers.
Please. Please.<eos> I need your help.<eos> Why don't you open that door, explain it to the captain?<eos> I swear to you, there is no time for that.<eos> Behind that wall...
CTU won't be able to trace the leak back to you.<eos> That's what you said the first time. Henry, you asked me to handle your mess.<eos> I'm handling it.<eos> Giving up those soldiers was bad enough.<eos> Now Nilaa.
Please, listen to me.<eos> You can't do this.<eos> I already told you, Papa.<eos> I'm going to teach the infidels a lesson.<eos> Infidels?
I just want to say thank you, man.<eos> For everything.<eos> I'm your brother, man.<eos> Uh, yeah. Listen, where's Nicole?<eos> She with Omar.
Um, I'm sorry to hear about what you're going through, Rebecca.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Jadalla contacted me.<eos> - When?<eos> - Just now.
I kept telling myself I was gonna work through it before bringing her into it, but...<eos> Don't be too hard on yourself.<eos> In my opinion, in this line of work it's okay to keep some things to yourself.<eos> Even from the people you love?<eos> Especially from them.
I'm gonna do everything I can to protect you, I promise, but I need you to go in here and don't make a sound, not until I come get you.<eos> And then what?<eos> Where will I go?<eos> Home.<eos> With my father?
Which means everything you've done will come out, and you won't be able to talk your way out of it.<eos> You'll hear from the attorney general.<eos> Rebecca's ambulance is exiting 29.<eos> - What are you working on?<eos> - Signal lights.
Perhaps. A few days later they went to miranshah to visit with some relatives.<eos> I couldn't go, I had to stay in the city for work.<eos> Miranshah is in waziristan, right?<eos> On the Afghan border where the Taliban are?<eos> Among other things.
How can you be so blind not to see that?<eos> What the fuck are you talking about?<eos> You mustered a force stronger than you had any right to hope for.<eos> You hit the governor when he was at his weakest.<eos> And at what result?
And at what result?<eos> Eleanor is dead, Anne is nearly dead, and the governor is sitting in Nassau in my fucking chair victorious!<eos> You cannot fight civilization from the outside in.<eos> And your plan now is to follow that man into more of the same?<eos> ! "What result?"
two shillings.<eos> Non-negotiable.<eos> This is... this is truly marvelous.<eos> - And we're the thieves.<eos> - Not very good ones, apparently.
As fascinating as all this is, we've still got Kant to wrestle with today.<eos> Hey.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Oh, I believe the phrase is "hiding like a coward."<eos> Mingo.
Point taken.<eos> Damn!<eos> Yeah, sorry.<eos> Luca seems like a great boy.<eos> Man.
She's working her way back.<eos> But we finally got her out of the wheelchair for a little bit last week.<eos> I'm so sorry I wasn't here for you.<eos> You were in China.<eos> With your ex-boyfriend.
And speaking of talent, allow me to introduce my extraordinary right hand.<eos> I would be lost without her.<eos> Pleasure to meet you.<eos> - Lila is Neapolitan.<eos> - Italian?
I would be lost without her.<eos> Pleasure to meet you.<eos> - Lila is Neapolitan.<eos> - Italian?<eos> Neapolitan.
If I didn't take people where they hired me to take them... I wouldn't expect them to get back on my bus.<eos> We expect leaders to take us where we want to go.<eos> The problem, it seems to me, begins when they don't.<eos> When things do not improve and yet these leaders keep expecting us to get on their bus... I think this is when leaders become something else.<eos> What?

But lucky you seem to already have yours, the latest ones with less side effects.<eos> Seems like somebody might have a friend at BPO.<eos> Wait.<eos> Blockers aren't gonna keep you safe forever, Riley Blue. Not from BPO.<eos> And not from me.
You were right about the difference between us.<eos> I want to live as you live, without a leash around my neck.<eos> Thank God.<eos> Fredrick said you were with him.<eos> With who?
- Yeah.<eos> We found her.<eos> Her name is Carol Cumberland.<eos> She was here.<eos> With Whispers.
I am Kikuyu.<eos> I'm Luo.<eos> My business partner and best friend is also mixed.<eos> His father, Sudanese.<eos> His mother, Kenyan.
We handle ourselves and Chuck gives someone Head of Crim.<eos> Or we cooperate with Dake and try our luck starting over with Chuck's replacement.<eos> Yeah, we saw what he did.<eos> And so you haven't seen anything that makes you think this office is acting<eos> - in an out-of-bounds manner?
I will walk him through the plans for the football stadium renovation.<eos> Oh! And the NCAA just posted our student-athlete graduation success rate.<eos> It's at 92%!<eos> Oh, bring it on!<eos> 7:30.
Plays into the idea that Joshua and Zachary were just a pair of troubled kids looking for a cause, no different than some school shooter.<eos> The post has been shared over 100,000 times.<eos> I want to talk with her.<eos> -Hannah?<eos> -The mother.
Look.<eos> He won't notice the difference?<eos> - No.<eos> He's gonna be too distracted.<eos> - By?
I think I speak for the whole team when I say we're all looking forward to meeting Yuri immensely.<eos> Unless there are any further questions...?<eos> - Yes?<eos> - What does it eat?<eos> Journalists.
No underlying signs of violence.<eos> I'm waiting on dental records to put his identity beyond doubt.<eos> Meantime, I'm hoping to be able to lift a set of prints from the underlying dermis, but it's a slow process.<eos> Afternoon, Doc. Matey.<eos> - My three o'clock.
Tuesday nights, he helped out at Wilkins Youth Club, sir.<eos> They've been spoken to.<eos> Smalls left about half-ten.<eos> Nobody saw him again.<eos> No-one except the killer, at least.
Binsey, you say, Tessa was found?<eos> Yes, a house out that way. Owned by a family called Leighton-Asbury.<eos> Miss Palfrey was in service there.<eos> The head of the family is a doctor of some sort.<eos> Surgeon. Army surgeon.
Do we want him to?<eos> Bianchi's lawyer just gave me a dissertation on the Fourth Amendment and probable cause.<eos> - We had probable cause.<eos> - Follow the blood trail.<eos> A highly suspicious blood trail.
Yeah?<eos> Get ready to bust out some tacks.<eos> If you ever get tired of kissing babies, I might be willing to take you back.<eos> Really?<eos> Same lopsided desk and everything?
We saved Stiles, we brought everyone back, but that's not the way it's supposed to happen.<eos> There is always a price to pay.<eos> We learned that from the Nemeton.<eos> What kind of price?<eos> A big price?

Would you say, like, you're more brave or merciful?<eos> I'd say I'm neither.<eos> But I still plan to be a spectacular monarch.<eos> I hereby dub thee<eos> High King Eliot the Spectacular.
Who started it?<eos> - You did.<eos> I did?<eos> - You are such a liar!<eos> Liar?
What brings you to town?<eos> - I'm just visiting my sister.<eos> - Of course.<eos> Uh, which credit card will you be using today?<eos> - Uh, cash.
Do you speak French?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Uh, no, my...<eos> I just listen to French movies sometimes.<eos> - With subtitles?
I told her.<eos> - You told who?<eos> - Norma.<eos> I warned her about her kid.<eos> - What about Norman?
- I was, uh, just drinking more than I should have, so, you know, things are a little foggy.<eos> - I found you passed out, so I put you to bed.<eos> Hey, I got a question for you.<eos> Do you often have times like that where you get unconscious?<eos> - Sometimes, yeah.
No, I did not.<eos> That is not true.<eos> Well, maybe not you personally, but the organization you work for.<eos> We're just soldiers.<eos> Soldiers?
I didn't say that.<eos> Yeah, you did.<eos> He did, didn't he?<eos> We know you're private contractors.<eos> Mercenaries.

This is on me.<eos> - That's insane.<eos> Just tell me you're putting your daughter in a car right now.<eos> - Okay, fine.<eos> - No buts.
Let's find you a place to sit down.<eos> No.<eos> Dr. Faulk warned us someone would insert themselves into the case, manipulate it.<eos> That the killer would need to feel in control.<eos> The ki...
I'm Barbara Gilbert, midwife and curate's fiancee, - not Zsa Zsa Gabor.<eos> - Not many girls would say that.<eos> Well, you're not engaged to many girls.<eos> No.<eos> Just you.
I want Dr Turner to see her.<eos> He will want to see her, too.<eos> I'm sorry, it's just... .. the smell of the milk.<eos> Breakfasts have been impossible.<eos> Breakfasts?
They said he had an opportunity in the private sector, but we all know what that means.<eos> Yeah, they're finally taking us seriously.<eos> There's a lot of work still to be done, but things are starting to change. (Iris sighs) And then, some things never change.<eos> (Australian accent) G'day, ladies.<eos> Hey, Mingo.
- No, that's not it!<eos> - I'm throwing myself at you, and you would rather watch TV.<eos> O... okay, look, Kathryn, I... lately, I've...<eos> I've been having a little trouble... with my equipment.<eos> Equipment?
Folks who looked more like what a supervisor looked like in their eyes.<eos> From what I've seen, sitting by, waiting to be acknowledged doesn't work.<eos> You gotta take it.<eos> I'm the opposite of you.<eos> The good girl.
- Why? Because when I'm around her, I feel connected to Angelo.<eos> The question is, why don't you?<eos> Regina: So I heard Carlton's big day is coming up.<eos> How do you feel about all that?<eos> What?
The question is, why don't you?<eos> Regina: So I heard Carlton's big day is coming up.<eos> How do you feel about all that?<eos> What?<eos> Baptism?
How do you feel about all that?<eos> What?<eos> Baptism?<eos> Everything.<eos> God, angels, Heaven, Hell.
I understand that he was a boxer.<eos> He was a boxer? When?<eos> That's a lifetime ago.<eos> He told me he started boxing in his early 20s.<eos> Before the war.
Who killed him, Seeley?<eos> I don't know, Dave, but I'm gonna find out.<eos> Need my help?<eos> No, I'm good.<eos> Not me.
They don't know who this kid is.<eos> That's not your dad's son.<eos> Can I get my friend a burger over here, please?<eos> Come on, I'm good.<eos> Really. Double cheese.
The maxillary sinuses have multiple scratches that appear to have been made with a sharp, thin object.<eos> How about an ice pick?<eos> That would do the job.<eos> Mike's nail beds are lacerated, because the fingernails were torn from the phalanges.<eos> Yeah. Most likely with these.
My partner needs this.<eos> I'll do what I can.<eos> But no promises.<eos> I've been working on the killer's communications from that gym.<eos> What communications?
I was just dreaming about you.<eos> What was the dream?<eos> You were a little girl.<eos> And we were in the car, driving.<eos> The whole family.
No.<eos> No, that would be the liver of a moose.<eos> Damn it!<eos> Hey, good try, though, you know?<eos> Maybe next time.
Look, Cam, if we can find the make and model of the chain saw that was used, we may be able to match it to a chain saw owned by one of the remaining non-lumberjack suspects.<eos> Unfortunately, there's a small grain of intelligence in that theory.<eos> So... we can keep going?<eos> Just get it over with.<eos> Yeah!
He went out looking for potential burial sites for Gormogon's apprentice.<eos> So far he's zero for four.<eos> Ooh. What are we looking at?<eos> Is this more bank robbery footage?<eos> No, not exactly.
I knew this was a mistake.<eos> What was a mistake?<eos> Ronny is a... creative guy, full of all these wild ideas.<eos> And after directing all the Snoozeland commercials, he decided he was ready for the real thing.<eos> A real commercial?
What was a mistake?<eos> Ronny is a... creative guy, full of all these wild ideas.<eos> And after directing all the Snoozeland commercials, he decided he was ready for the real thing.<eos> A real commercial?<eos> Movie.
And after directing all the Snoozeland commercials, he decided he was ready for the real thing.<eos> A real commercial?<eos> Movie.<eos> Said he was gonna be the next Gordon Welles.<eos> Orson Welles?
Are they new?<eos> You haven't heard of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.<eos> Oh, that FBI.<eos> Bummer. I thought you guys were, like, Hollywood agents.<eos> Real agents.
I'm Aubrey.<eos> If people hear I got into another fight with a director, I'll be uninsurable.<eos> My career will be over.<eos> Please, Agent Andy... Uh this has to stay between the two of us.<eos> The two of you?
And if he was still wearing the panther claw...<eos> Well, actually, I think I found something on the margins of the foramen magnum.<eos> Oh, yes, the ring fracture, caused by the fall from the overpass.<eos> I noted this injury early in the investigation, Mr. Bray.<eos> No, uh, underneath it.
Hi!<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Ange, I'm so sorry to crash your party, but we don't have a lot of time.<eos> I need to see Agent Booth.<eos> Booth?
BNC is now ready to call San Benito county and the state of California, and...<eos> This is a surprise.<eos> BNC is projecting that governor Frankie Vargas will carry San Benito county... And the state of California to become the next President of the United States.<eos> Wow.<eos> Amazing.
I'm gonna need you to stay with me.<eos> I need an ambulance!<eos> How is he?<eos> The shot almost completely severed his femoral artery, so they're trying to stabilize him.<eos> And him?
- Hey, listen. You're not going to Yemen.<eos> - Stop me.<eos> - You won't make it three days.<eos> We need to go through the proper channels.<eos> The proper channels?
I have a scathingly brilliant idea.<eos> Don't leave town.<eos> That's what the police say in all the movies.<eos> - Do you trust me?<eos> - Sometimes.
I don't know anything!<eos> Everything that I thought I knew, everything it just came from the big bag of lies!<eos> Honey, Mary Drake will never bother you again.<eos> I will make sure of that.<eos> Your father and I...
It hasn't decided yet.<eos> - Hm... - Are you always up this early?<eos> Hey, good morning.<eos> - Who are you talking to?<eos> - Uh, nobody.
She used my pills to do it and she buried her in our backyard.<eos> She killed Jessica and did everything she could to frame me for it.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> I mean, they were sisters.<eos> Twins.
Sydney helped Jenna get past us and got her to the blind school.<eos> She can lead us to Jenna.<eos> And before Jenna makes me roll the dice and gamble away my future.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> What dice?
That's some pretty spendy real estate.<eos> She's a bank teller?<eos> Well, private client banking.<eos> Her department services people with a lot of money.<eos> Like a lot, a lot.
Those are talking points we'd like you to consider...<eos> But every single one is about Nicole.<eos> Um, how we fell in love, Nicole's disappearance Nicole's rescue, our reunion.<eos> That is what the book is about?<eos> Nicole.
They didn't find her.<eos> But they found something.<eos> I can tell by your eyes.<eos> Don't push your luck, Aria.<eos> Not with me.
Fiftyeight minutes.<eos> Doesn't that seem a little odd to you?<eos> I've got a whole list of things that seem odd to me about this case.<eos> Who are you supposed to meet here?<eos> No one.
Will you join us?<eos> No, actually, II really can't stay.<eos> Another time then.<eos> So, you as ticked off as I am?<eos> About what?
No, actually, II really can't stay.<eos> Another time then.<eos> So, you as ticked off as I am?<eos> About what?<eos> About Mona.
But I'm married to someone who did.<eos> Spencer, you know how these things work.<eos> How can I take that job when I'll just be treading water waiting for the shark to take another bite.<eos> I guess some dreams were meant to be just that.<eos> Dreams.
Eat me, Burrows.<eos> Say we're clear.<eos> I'm gonna get more guys.<eos> And you'll be running again.<eos> Not this time.
Seventeen.<eos> Seventeen doses of the cure.<eos> But now we're looking at a few hundred zombies.<eos> - Can you make more?<eos> - Not at this time.
- This is it.<eos> - With me in studio right now, is Billy Cook, eyewitness to the bloodbath at the Max Rager headquarters, and what he is about to impart upon us, my friends, is going to confirm everything.<eos> Your government is plotting against you.<eos> We are all slaves.<eos> Slaves!
Like when you were little and you had chores, if you had chores.<eos> This is the torture chamber, also known as the dining room.<eos> Chores, uh, which I never had because that would assume I had parents who gave a shit...<eos> - So, you do chores to get points?<eos> - Among other things, yes.
Is this somebody special?<eos> He's my friend, kind of...<eos> It all got fucked up.<eos> In the morning, Olive would like you to work with Freya.<eos> The horse?
We'll snag you a guy by midnight.<eos> Nice of you to offer, but I'm not really looking to start a new relationship right now.<eos> Who said anything about a relationship?<eos> I'm talking about a "Wham, bam, thank you, sir" to take your mind off, um... what's his name?<eos> Mingo.
But it's hard to find good couple friends.<eos> And I feel like we're barely social anymore as it is.<eos> What about the Barkers?<eos> Divorced, remember?<eos> Um, the Clarks?
When we left the island, she was on her own.<eos> Me and Jamil are upstairs.<eos> And... that one's Gemma's room, at the end there.<eos> - Right. So who's Jamil?<eos> - A PhD student.
Well, they weren't just mourning their son on that island.<eos> I think they were looking for evidence.<eos> Mr Hogarth.<eos> People keep asking when it's re-opening.<eos> - Any idea? - Oh, not any time soon, pet.
I do it the same time every day.<eos> - What time is it now?<eos> - About half past four.<eos> There you gan.<eos> - What about the evening?
- Together?<eos> I don't usually do that sort of thing, but...<eos> Hm.<eos> - Jamil had had an affair with Gemma.<eos> - Gemma?
Yeah.<eos> Look, I'm-I'm sorry, she must be using a different password.<eos> Well, I'll lay odds on this.<eos> Try that.<eos> Puffin 345.
Look, I swear, I didn't mean for anyone to get hurt.<eos> I didn't know what The Widow would do.<eos> You turned them in?<eos> Where's M.K. now?<eos> With her.
Lady, heart ain't got anything to do with it.<eos> That's it.<eos> What do you say, Team Leader?<eos> Delta 1 making entry.<eos> On the clock.
You had this weird night-light that you were so crazy about.<eos> It was, um...<eos> - It was Daffy Duck!<eos> - It was some Daffy Duck rip-off... - ... with this weird red... bill.<eos> - Mouth.
It was, um...<eos> - It was Daffy Duck!<eos> - It was some Daffy Duck rip-off... - ... with this weird red... bill.<eos> - Mouth.<eos> - Oh, yeah, yeah, the bill.
How exactly do you know all this?<eos> I asked him.<eos> He's a real mensch when he's not in withdrawal.<eos> I didn't know you talked to him.<eos> Amazing.
I mean, the tiniest detail, less than a millimeter, differentiates everything.<eos> An emotion on one person can be... so troubled and on another... so beautiful.<eos> You're not trying to get somewhere, are you, Mr. Ness? Yes, actually,<eos> I am.<eos> Hello there.
I could tell.<eos> But then he got in.<eos> I took him to the house.<eos> When he saw she wasn't there, he got scared, tried to leave, so I knocked him out.<eos> Chloroform.
I deserve this.<eos> We got a puppy problem.<eos> What?<eos> - He knows Rebecca's dead.<eos> - How?
No.<eos> Alleging this conspiracy was pre-meditated.<eos> So, Wes, uh, where do I start?<eos> Wes was a really great guy.<eos> Like, really just...
Alleging this conspiracy was pre-meditated.<eos> So, Wes, uh, where do I start?<eos> Wes was a really great guy.<eos> Like, really just...<eos> Good.
Nah.<eos> Just learning a lot about you.<eos> Like what?<eos> Like you're a really good liar.<eos> Eh, not really.
Yummy, yummy, yummy in your tummy, tummy, tummy.<eos> Who's in there?<eos> Uh, no one.<eos> Michaela! Who are you?<eos> Uh... a friend.
Get into her computer, phone records, bank statements, anything that'll link her to the Mahoneys.<eos> Well, you got her password.<eos> That saves me about an hour.<eos> The rest of you, dig into the discovery of my case...<eos> Police records, interviews.
Abu Ramal is a monster.<eos> And there's a spot in Hell reserved for him, but the hottest spot is reserved for Poseidon, because he is letting Ramal loose on the world again.<eos> Those men, they have the blood of thousands, thousands on their hands.<eos> Compared to them, you and me are a couple of angels.<eos> - "Angels"? - Mm-hmm.
You're a liability! Wait.<eos> Wait.<eos> You said you'd get me out, all the way home. That was the deal.<eos> Ramal, this man follows us, tell your men to shoot him.<eos> Gladly.
Looks like they can take me back.<eos> - Oh. That's great.<eos> And, you know, if we ever get another office up, you'd be our first call.<eos> Okay. Good to know.<eos> Bye, Kim. Oh.
Get the hell out of there, man.<eos> I'll talk to you soon, buddy.<eos> Sit.<eos> Allowing a ContraCrime guard on to the Blood Drive was an error.<eos> "Error"?
He ordered the number three with potatoes and coffee, went bold with the extra salsa,<eos> And he paid cash out of his left front pocket.<eos> Uh, took his tray of food, sat in a booth on the east side of the restaurant, and put the knapsack on the floor.<eos> Where on the floor?<eos> Under his seat, between his legs.
Well, it's just...<eos> I'm not sure how to start.<eos> You can start by just telling me.<eos> Here's the thing. I have some information, But I don't want to get in trouble.<eos> Trouble with Jimmy?
- He said, "On me."<eos> - Where does that lead you?<eos> Mikey used to always go to an arcade after school.<eos> And he'd throw quarters to his friends sometimes, too, but he never gave me any.<eos> Except this one time.
Demon briefing in the ops center.<eos> All hands on deck.<eos> My dear Raj...<eos> You look well.<eos> Rain check?
You've sired hundreds of vampires.<eos> Your children.<eos> But as a warlock, I can have none.<eos> The Downworlders I take under my wing, they are my children.<eos> My family.
I don't understand.<eos> I was nine years old when my mother realized what my cat eyes meant.<eos> She couldn't live with the fact that she bore the son of a demon.<eos> So she took her life.<eos> With this very keris.
You don't understand.<eos> I've waited my whole life to see the Iron Sisters.<eos> I can do this.<eos> The truth is, you can't do this, Isabelle.<eos> Not with a venom infection.
You took a blood oath.<eos> Fine. Call me when you need me.<eos> I need you now.<eos> You are going to host one of my finest creations.<eos> "Host"?
We met in first grade.<eos> Miss Hiddleston's art class.<eos> She ran to get the nurse when I had an allergic reaction to clay.<eos> So, naturally, we've been best friends ever since.<eos> - Best friends, huh? - Mmm-hmm.
I didn't wanna feel like there was something wrong with me, because I grew up in the Institute, because... I always knew I couldn't have what I wanted... until you came along.<eos> Nothing's wrong with you.<eos> Far from it.<eos> But you're so... innocent.<eos> In some ways, but...
What do you mean?<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> Alexander, look, I've lived for centuries.<eos> I've been with men, women, Seelies, warlocks, vampires...<eos> - a djinn or two.
Yeah. And so do they.<eos> You know, I didn't think hot-tempered wolves were your type, Simon.<eos> Maia?<eos> No, we're just, um...<eos> Friends.
- Good luck.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Wait.<eos> Will you be my Obi-Wan?<eos> Who?
You killed Magdalena, didn't you?<eos> I loved Magdalena.<eos> I thought Valentine...<eos> I thought his way was the only way to make the world a better place.<eos> A safer place.
She can't remember who I am.<eos> Yet I can't forget about her.<eos> I didn't know.<eos> Nobody knows.<eos> Except for you.
You know I get claustrophobic.<eos> I know.<eos> But I'm doing this for your own safety.<eos> I don't want to have to fight you.<eos> Me?
Nothing.<eos> Haven't we proven ourselves?<eos> Valentine attacked the Institute.<eos> We captured him.<eos> At what cost?
The Accords will be near impossible to maintain now.<eos> Fall in line, or you'll end up like Aldertree and Idris facing reprimand.<eos> Evening, gentlemen.<eos> I'll have a scotch.<eos> Neat.
Ah, 1998 Blanc de Noir.<eos> I like beer.<eos> Gets me drunk.<eos> To Lily.<eos> To Gideon.
Do you recall how we resolved disputes within the League?<eos> Now...<eos> I suggest you choose a blade that matches that sharp tongue of yours.<eos> Excuse me for a second.<eos> Gladly.
By all means, Dr. Heywood, please enlighten us.<eos> Okay. What if Thawne isn't just chasing us?<eos> What if he's running from something?<eos> But running from what?<eos> Time.
We're now all equally dead.<eos> Oh, I wouldn't worry about that.<eos> This isn't the first scary speedster that we had to put in his place.<eos> We're gonna get you out of this bank vault, Eobard.<eos> But on one condition.
- Yes! Dr. Brand invents the technology that traps Savitar in the Speed Force.<eos> - Good luck with that.<eos> - We don't wanna fight you.<eos> We're your friends.<eos> Your family.
His teacher said that he didn't understand the assignment, and... Lennon said that they didn't understand life.<eos> H.R. understood life.<eos> He wasn't a genius, and he didn't have super speed. But when we needed him the most, he was our hero.<eos> He was my hero.<eos> Mine too.
She's not our Laurel, ok?<eos> I can't pretend to understand parallel worlds, but if I'm gonna believe in them... And... and I kind of have to now... Then I need to believe that differences are caused by circumstances, so why can't we change this Laurel's circumstances?<eos> You think that you can save her?<eos> After she's thrown in with Prometheus?<eos> Under duress.
Not exactly.<eos> I'm representing you.<eos> Your friend Oliver's persuasive, plus he's my boss. Heh.<eos> General Walker, the guy who wants you out of the picture, you know who his boss is?<eos> The President.
When Oliver explained his thinking to us on this, which he rarely ever does by the way, I thought you would be more on board.<eos> How'd the last crazy recruit turn out?<eos> Evelyn did have her issues, true, but so did Rory, and Oliver channeled his vendetta into something positive, and as far as nut cases are concerned, y...<eos> "As far as nut cases are concerned" what?<eos> Nothing.
I'm not trying to escape that, but it feels like some bad dream.<eos> Now, regardless of my sanity, why do you want to help me after everything I've done?<eos> There is a man here on the island named Adrian Chase.<eos> He's holding my friends and my family hostage, including Thea...<eos> And my son.
I found this 10 feet from the wing.<eos> Please don't tell me that's what I think it is.<eos> Depends on if you think that's an on-wing hydraulic system.<eos> Can we repair it?<eos> With what tools?
What?<eos> What's that look?<eos> Nothing.<eos> You've been spending a lot of time with her. Her?<eos> Who?
What's that look?<eos> Nothing.<eos> You've been spending a lot of time with her. Her?<eos> Who?<eos> Anita?
You ever visit him?<eos> He wouldn't ever tell us where he was living.<eos> He was ashamed, Hal.<eos> That was just before he deployed the first time.<eos> The first time?
She wants you to take it down for the Open House.<eos> It's not a judgment or a reflection on you at all.<eos> It's just that the Open House is mostly for prospective families.<eos> And with attendance down after the whole Nick situation,<eos> - the lockdown...
- Is this all of it?<eos> - Callie?<eos> Hey.<eos> - Are you behind this boycott at the Open House?<eos> - No. What boycott?
Thank you.<eos> There is something else that you should know.<eos> Nick's dad is the one who is behind all of this.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> How?
As of 12 hours ago at least.<eos> Are you ready for this?<eos> When I signed on, I didn't think I'd be stopping a nuclear arms deal in a foreign country.<eos> Yeah. When I signed on, I didn't think I'd be dealing with aliens.<eos> - Aliens? - Yeah.
Sorry. I mean, prosti.<eos> I can't see a thing in these.<eos> Tough guys don't say sorry, Curtis.<eos> Right.<eos> No "prosti." Err.
Maybe somebody there still knows how to get in contact with him.<eos> Text me the address and have him meet me there.<eos> I didn't care. It was just a necklace. But Steve, he got in front of the man and...<eos> Every time I close my eyes, I see the gun.<eos> Every time.
What is this?<eos> Citywide gun control ordinances.<eos> Nothing that makes it harder to buy or own or carry a gun.<eos> It also doesn't prohibit people from protecting themselves.<eos> From gun violence.
You think this is about taking a vacation?<eos> We're taking over.<eos> We're taking back this city.<eos> Yeah? You and what army?<eos> This one!
I don't know what I can do to stop it.<eos> Well, Oliver, there are always options, and you're not alone.<eos> Do you think that's the problem?<eos> You've done a wonderful job of convincing me that I'm changing for the better...<eos> With the recruits and the...
As the new Pakhan, I...<eos> I have to meet with him.<eos> He will suspect something is up.<eos> I could try to talk to Galina.<eos> - To who?
Your boss?<eos> You... you work for Konstantin Kovar.<eos> He said you were enemy.<eos> No, no. No.<eos> - A... a bad man.
And--and, I mean, he just told you this?<eos> Before I got there, he was making deal with American businessman, some secret sensitive shipment.<eos> You think it's a weapon?<eos> Kovar has many men, but not enough for a coup.<eos> But with weapon.
This is not human.<eos> Anatoly, I told you putting on this hood, it helps me direct the darkness inside of me.<eos> It worked, by the way.<eos> I know what Kovar's planning.<eos> But at what cost?
Clearly withstood a lot before breaking.<eos> He gave up pretty quickly.<eos> The rest was me practicing.<eos> Practicing to become what?<eos> Something else.
Your best men were arrested.<eos> Already out on bail.<eos> I hear they cannot wait to get revenge on vigilantes that put them away.<eos> This is between you and me, no one else.<eos> "No one else"?
- You know what he can't change?<eos> What?<eos> That way he looks at you.<eos> You both owe it to each other to see, Felicity, tonight.<eos> Tonight? No.
What?<eos> That way he looks at you.<eos> You both owe it to each other to see, Felicity, tonight.<eos> Tonight? No.<eos> Why tonight?
What's he been up to since getting out of prison?<eos> Partying like a guy who just got out of prison.<eos> Let's stay on him and whoever else we think are the most dangerous.<eos> What about your office's newest art installation?<eos> The concrete councilman.
The concrete councilman.<eos> Dinah's working the evidence.<eos> If she gets a lead, we make a move.<eos> How is it going with, uh...<eos> - William. - Yup.
It just means that you're working on them.<eos> When did you become all zen-like and well-adjusted?<eos> Well... We should celebrate that tonight as well as your birthday.<eos> I appreciate that, but I already have plans.<eos> With who?
By "took care of," you mean...<eos> Dead, dead, dead.<eos> I'd like a moment alone with the Daylighter.<eos> - Alone?<eos> - With Simon?
I don't like that guy.<eos> Who, Jace?<eos> That's not Jace.<eos> All Shadowhunters look the same to me.<eos> Except Isabelle, of course.
He would never hurt anyone.<eos> There has to be some explanation for this.<eos> - I know Simon.<eos> - The Simon you know is a vampire, Clary.<eos> A vampire with a broken heart.
If he was travelling with anyone?<eos> Well, like I say, we try to keep them fed and warm, no questions asked.<eos> I recognize you, don't I?<eos> You attended service for a while?<eos> My wife and I.
Natalie?<eos> !<eos> Communes with the spirits.<eos> Heals the sick.<eos> Sometimes.
So I'm not... I'm not blind, I'm just mental.<eos> A psychological reaction to the wasp trauma.<eos> Wha-wha-what about if it's a physiological reaction to the wasp trauma?<eos> Well, then Doctor Adebimpe would have found a physiological explanation...<eos> With his little ophthalmoscope and his torch?
A psychological reaction to the wasp trauma.<eos> Wha-wha-what about if it's a physiological reaction to the wasp trauma?<eos> Well, then Doctor Adebimpe would have found a physiological explanation...<eos> With his little ophthalmoscope and his torch?<eos> Plus the OCT and MRI scanners.
We collected their body fluids.<eos> Mopped up their remains and examined them.<eos> I felt no guilt or shame amongst all that death because out of it, our work brought hope and possibility.<eos> I stank of vomit and blood and human excrement every night.<eos> But never guilt.
I ain't...<eos> Don't say that. We wanna space all them prisoners, too, but the big man say no.<eos> Earther.<eos> I'm just, just a cop.<eos> A cop.
Two kilometers long, half a kilometer wide.<eos> And at the center, a piece of Earth, curved back on itself.<eos> Our Eden.<eos> Any idea how we can take out a whole asteroid?<eos> With that.
Ah, Jesus.<eos> This guy... He's got protomolecule all over him...<eos> Looks like he's been inside.<eos> Is there a ship name on his vac-suit?<eos> Marasmus.
The only thing I could do was to try to signal for help.<eos> Caty would realize that I was in trouble.<eos> She'd figure out a way to help me.<eos> It was my only hope.<eos> - My last chance.
The protomolecule is proof that we're not alone in the universe.<eos> And our ticket out of the limitations that bind us to these pathetic little bubbles of rock and air.<eos> If we master it, we can apply it.<eos> Apply it to what?<eos> To everything.
We must move inside the mansion.<eos> The only safe place is inside.<eos> There's one with child.<eos> Will you have a look?<eos> With child?
Now do you believe me?<eos> You test my word with my very life.<eos> - Forgive me.<eos> - I am bound to this hell.<eos> At present, this very house.
Man is part matter...<eos> Part spirit.<eos> Part angel.<eos> Part animal.<eos> Mostly animal.
Yes. But before long I will be sober... and you... will forever be a lying, vile, evil bitch.<eos> Cotton! Did you know that I was in love once?<eos> Before we met.<eos> Love? No. I-I knew in your wild youth you spent a lot of time with...<eos> women of the night... Oh, no, not women.
Cotton! Did you know that I was in love once?<eos> Before we met.<eos> Love? No. I-I knew in your wild youth you spent a lot of time with...<eos> women of the night... Oh, no, not women.<eos> One woman.
No matter how far off. If you do, I am afraid...<eos> What could a thing like you possibly fear?<eos> What I will become.<eos> I used to long for your porcelain skin.<eos> Your soft lips.
Of course. That is what we women are to you.<eos> A good woman is half doll, half angel, and a bad woman is but a hideous fiend.<eos> Well, I would not be your angel-doll a second longer, even if I could.<eos> I would rather be a fiend.<eos> A great fiend!
Wait, what are you- where are you taking him?<eos> Where are you taking him?<eos> Travis!<eos> - Travis! - I'll find you, maddie.<eos> Oneshot,man.
Are you Mexican?<eos> No.<eos> - Persian?<eos> - No.<eos> Maori.
B's10yearshis junior. Skinnyturnsfirst, youlose30k.<eos> Blake: There'sanomalies,pal.<eos> Willy: Those anomalies areexceptionsthat provetherule.<eos> Hey, what's up with the dead outside?<eos> Lowercase dead or capital "d" dead?
And I enjoyed killing Greyjoys.<eos> A good thing for me.<eos> If you hadn't crushed us, I wouldn't have gone into exile.<eos> If I hadn't done that, I wouldn't be the greatest captain on the 14 seas.<eos> If not the most humble.
You know why.<eos> I don't.<eos> Y-you are my weakness.<eos> That's what I am?<eos> Your weakness?
It's not always gonna be tails.<eos> It had been a hard journey east across the land bridge from Siberia.<eos> Freezing and dark, and it had taken a bitter toll.<eos> After the custom of her people, Atsula spoke her baby's name...<eos> Aputi.
Next to every cemetery is a motel.<eos> Once we did it, we'd already done it, and there was no undoing it.<eos> Were you going to leave me for him?<eos> For Robbie?<eos> Please.
A question would be "What do you believe you saw?"<eos> I don't know what I believe.<eos> They killed those cops.<eos> A warning to me, a sacrifice to them.<eos> Sacrifice?
God of the volcano.<eos> Those who worship hold the volcano in the palm of their hand.<eos> It's filled with prayers... in my name.<eos> The power of fire is firepower.<eos> Not God. But godlike.
Tell him. Tell him it's done.<eos> Créd as co tarlaid an cac-sa dam?<eos> Nach lór rofhulangas?<eos> Is lór chena, níam olc!<eos> Níam!
I want 'em docile, not dead.<eos> You see, this here arrangement, boy, don't make us friends.<eos> You think about that next time you feel like talking out of turn in my fields.<eos> Old buckra.<eos> Sick of rice.
I had to leave or they were gonna take me to prison.<eos> I had to run and run fast. And you can't run fast with a five-year-old.<eos> Not just a five-year-old.<eos> Your five-year-old.<eos> Your daughter.
No. Right. Theo Galavan killed me, that jug-eared Judas.<eos> Well, I suppose I should start by killing him.<eos> Theo Galavan's dead.<eos> Who beat me to it?<eos> W-Which time?
I'm not myself these days.<eos> Hands, please.<eos> I can be a member of a group, but I can never blend in.<eos> - What am I?<eos> A shadow?
- I feel your every thought...<eos> I feel your every move, I know your every thought,<eos> I'm with you from birth, and I'll see you rot.<eos> What am I?<eos> A reflection.
I saved your life.<eos> My men are on their way.<eos> You trust him?<eos> But I... I thought we were friends.<eos> Friends? Friends.
Fear and respect... management 101.<eos> No one ever respected you.<eos> We always saw you for what you really are.<eos> A tiny freak who used to hold an umbrella. Nothing more.<eos> A freak?
No one ever respected you.<eos> We always saw you for what you really are.<eos> A tiny freak who used to hold an umbrella. Nothing more.<eos> A freak?<eos> A freak?
It's the best thing that's ever happened to me.<eos> I don't need a cure.<eos> I will purge Gotham and the innocents will thank me!<eos> Their savior!<eos> Their executioner.
Run away. And don't you ever come back here.<eos> I-I'm good, thanks. I'm good.<eos> Bullock, got a kid who saw Barnes flee the scene. All right, kid, talk.<eos> I saw some guy in leather, had an axe attached to his arm, drove off in some delivery truck.<eos> What kind?
I hereby...<eos> Don't move!<eos> I got you, buddy.<eos> He's running!<eos> Alvarez.
Don't move a muscle. Obviously, I surrender.<eos> You know where to take it.<eos> Oh, thank God.<eos> So you're the top boy, are you?<eos> The leader?
You must be very proud of yourself, Ed, thinking you outsmarted me.<eos> Well, frankly, it wasn't really a challenge.<eos> Now, you're gonna do one thing before you die.<eos> Call me...<eos> The Riddler.
The Riddler.<eos> No.<eos> You have a choice, Oswald.<eos> This can happen real quick or it can take hours.<eos> Days.
That boy is stronger than you can possibly imagine.<eos> I just need to make him remember... who he is.<eos> As long as he doesn't leave the precinct.<eos> Harvey, something you need to see.<eos> An antidote?
A magician friend told me you kind of distract 'em and tag...<eos> I needed to know where she was so I could stay one step ahead of her.<eos> She is... - At the waterfront. - At the waterfront.<eos> What do you say?<eos> For Francisco?
- It's her choice.<eos> Allen, it's not a wise move, surely.<eos> She can barely control her cold powers as is.<eos> - I mean... - We might need her for Grodd.<eos> Grodd? Gr...
No, it's... it's not that...<eos> I want to be with Wally.<eos> This whole thing has made us realize that we have no idea what's gonna happen, you know, and...<eos> And if we're gonna go through something, we want to go through it together.<eos> This guy?
How do we get out of here?<eos> You're in a movie musical.<eos> So all you have to do is just follow the...<eos> The Yellow Brick Road?<eos> No, the... the script. - Oh, yeah.
By who?<eos> Doesn't really matter now, does it?<eos> All I know is we got millions of dollars of tech... like whatever that thing is... that no one's using.<eos> Then surely you gentlemen won't mind if I abscond with some of it.<eos> This piece in particular.
Okay, well, we should approach this the same way we approach any other problem... start with what we know.<eos> Problem can't be solved if it's not understood.<eos> Therein lies the rub. I feel like we can't understand any of this until it actually happens.<eos> It's like Savitar's prophecies.<eos> Precisely, and just like the newspaper headlines.
- Uh, it's bad.<eos> It's bad, there's quite a few pieces of shrapnel inside you, and they look deep enough to pierce your kidney if they're not removed immediately.<eos> Guys, we have to get her to a hospital.<eos> We can't, they're gonna ID her as a meta.<eos> And not just any meta.
All right, what do you need us to do?<eos> Just keep everybody else away from the pipeline.<eos> Barry, last time you went to the future, it was by accident.<eos> How are you supposed to get there now?<eos> With your help.
[gasps] Do I still have my kidneys?<eos> We don't want your kidneys.<eos> Okay, Barry... look at these photographs.<eos> We're your friends.<eos> Your family.
Are we planning the wedding?<eos> Like, are we sending out wedding invitations or picked a honeymoon destination, or...<eos> Am I a warm weather guy or a cold weather guy?<eos> Actually, we've been a little busy lately, so...<eos> With what?
You're so light.<eos> [laughs] What do you mean?<eos> I don't know, it's like you're not carrying the weight of the world on your shoulders.<eos> So, what, I was like... brooding all the time before?<eos> - Sometimes.
Maybe the city doesn't need The Flash.<eos> Hey, everybody!<eos> Happy Friday!<eos> So I am a superhero?<eos> - A real good one. - Huh.
No, but I can.<eos> Barry, you don't know how to use your powers.<eos> - Bar...<eos> - You just said I'm a superhero.<eos> And a good one, right?
Can't really avoid that now, can we?<eos> Yeah, we can.<eos> You can stay here with us.<eos> We're your friends.<eos> Your family.

How? I mean, you can't right now.<eos> No, but I can.<eos> Barry, you don't know how to use your powers.<eos> - Bar... - You just said I'm a superhero.<eos> And a good one, right?
Can't really avoid that now, can we?<eos> Yeah, we can.<eos> You can stay here with us.<eos> We're your friends.<eos> Your family.
My buddy works at the television academy.<eos> He did me a solid.<eos> 'Thank you.'<eos> Thank you to the Academy.<eos> 'But most importantly'
Small potatoes. I don't even think they make the cut.<eos> Uh... Uh!<eos> Elizabeth.<eos> Quiet.<eos> - You too, Meg.
You know, I already lost Stefan.<eos> I'm not losing you to Sybil's sabotage.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You did this dance.<eos> With Elena.
No, I'm choosing myself over everyone else.<eos> I was made for Cade's work.<eos> And, true to form, the minute I become my best self, you have to go ahead and ruin it.<eos> Well, I'm not gonna let you drag me down with you.<eos> Not this time.
No.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> The cure is off the table.<eos> I'm not risking my future<eos> - with Elena.
Are you gonna teach me how to contact Enzo?<eos> I'm going to give you an understanding of what you've become.<eos> You've had a powerful, traumatic awakening, just as I did.<eos> My true self sprang forth at the moment of my death.<eos> Along with hell and eternal suffering.
A heroic effort.<eos> But it seems your bell stopped ringing.<eos> I miss this kind of violence.<eos> It's personal.<eos> Direct.
See, if Katherine's back, that means hell still exists.<eos> Maybe there's a way to destroy the dimension itself.<eos> Destroying hell destroys her.<eos> She's gonna burn down Mystic Falls.<eos> With hellfire.
Okay. But only because I missed story time.<eos> Were you working last night?<eos> Uh, no. I had a little dinner.<eos> With who?<eos> Uh, Lucifer.
No mas.<eos> Look, I sent that text to, like, 25 girls last night.<eos> It's called a "booty call." You ever have one?<eos> Of course not. Booties call me.<eos> Sometimes.
I didn't have any zucchinis.<eos> He did this thing with my Tibetan singing pot and artisan honey.<eos> It's a game I play called,<eos> "Do I make you horny, honey?"<eos> with some Vaseline and a car battery. - What?
I'm a demon.<eos> I actually think you're more human than a lot of people I know.<eos> Take that back.<eos> Okay, okay, you're a good friend and a great pers...<eos> Demon.
But actually, whilst you're here...<eos> Here.<eos> Do you think I'm boyfriend material?<eos> Luci, you've never exactly been the type to get emotionally attached.<eos> To anyone.
it gets me every time.<eos> Any idea of how long it took the poison to activate?<eos> Well, it's hard to say for sure, but best guess, maybe 24 hours?<eos> I hope poor Ricky made 'em count. Enjoying what little life he had left with sex or friends.<eos> Or sex with friends.
And here, Leon Klem, accomplished track star, stuck in a vice.<eos> If Leon simply pulls the lever and severs his leg within 60 minutes,<eos> Benji here gets... this.<eos> You guessed it.<eos> The antidote.
Chloe wasn't supposed to be here.<eos> God put her in Lucifer's path.<eos> She's a... miracle.<eos> Granny Panties Decker?<eos> A miracle?
How many more ingredients do we need?<eos> Well, based off the list from that middleman dude, we've gathered all but one:<eos> a chemical called ZX3.<eos> Super rare, super illegal.<eos> - How rare?
Unless you're saying you found peace in that moment, brother.<eos> Oh, Luci, Luci, Luci. You should know better than that.<eos> I'm all about patterns, predicting the future.<eos> My last words were a clue.<eos> A clue?
This is your idea?<eos> The people that almost killed my boys, they're gonna be our backup?<eos> Suddenly, the demon and his mommy don't look so bad.<eos> They helped us with Lucifer.<eos> Lucifer? The Lucifer?
No idea when Lucifer's kid is gonna pop, if it hasn't already.<eos> So basically, we got nothin'.<eos> Basically.<eos> All right. Well, we do have this other thing.<eos> What other thing?
How 'bout for once, you just try to be a mom?<eos> I am your mother, but I am not "just a mom."<eos> And you are not a child.<eos> I never was.<eos> So between us and them...
What happened?<eos> It's bad out there.<eos> Pretty bad in here, too? No. Pierce, you're a Hunter.<eos> Yes.<eos> My hunter.
Okay.<eos> So you wait here.<eos> What?<eos> Sam, no offense, but who do you think the kids are gonna wanna talk to?<eos> Me, or some old skeezer?
I'm just saying.<eos> Okay, just imagine she's a... a beautiful woman.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> Get out of here.<eos> A beautiful, beautiful woman.
Look, I know you're working with the Winchesters.<eos> Sam and Dean -- their hearts are in the right place, but wouldn't it be better to have us waiting in the proverbial wings?<eos> All the power of Heaven behind you?<eos> You ever miss it?<eos> Upstairs?
So when was the last time you saw him?<eos> Last night.<eos> Closed up.<eos> Talked about our big day today.<eos> What big day?
All of 'em?<eos> Seriously?<eos> So I guess that means, safe to say that, black bill is definitely connected to the plant?<eos> Yeah. Or the family that runs it.<eos> Or both.
Growing up, my father'd tell me stories about a monster.<eos> Lived under our house and made our family rich.<eos> All we had to do was...<eos> Was feed it. Feed it what?<eos> Blood.
Lived under our house and made our family rich.<eos> All we had to do was...<eos> Was feed it. Feed it what?<eos> Blood.<eos> Human blood.
Wait, what are you talking about?<eos> What you did with me, with... With Gadreel, remember?<eos> The... the grace extraction.<eos> We take the grace from the baby, from the nephilim, and then the baby just becomes...<eos> Human.
What you did with me, with... With Gadreel, remember?<eos> The... the grace extraction.<eos> We take the grace from the baby, from the nephilim, and then the baby just becomes...<eos> Human.<eos> Human.
Yes, she is.<eos> Yeah, but, uh, this is what we need right now.<eos> Witch killing bullets.<eos> And what about you?<eos> Uh, with magic.
It's us.<eos> Please.<eos> What's wrong with you?<eos> Mom! Your bunker is an excellent fortress.<eos> An even better tomb.
Mom? I really wouldn't move.<eos> She will shoot you.<eos> Where do you think you're going?<eos> Ketch. Your bunker is an excellent fortress.<eos> An even better tomb.
Look at me.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> - Everything's gonna be fine.<eos> This is what you do when I'm not here?<eos> Type?
I think he thought...<eos> I had to turn him down.<eos> This was the first time I'd seen him since.<eos> And who did you talk to at the party?<eos> Everyone.
I walked a bit down the path.<eos> And then it felt like I was punched in the back of the head.<eos> Or... Or maybe hit with something.<eos> And did it feel like a fist or the flat of a hand or an object?<eos> Not a flat hand.
No. No, no. Trish gave her a wide berth.<eos> I was civil, that was it.<eos> I saw Sarah and Ian having a barney a bit later on, actually, and then she left shortly after that, luckily.<eos> Did she talk to anyone else?<eos> Ed, obviously.
She came over to me about 9:00 to be rescued.<eos> He's not a naturally sociable person, Ed.<eos> He sticks to one or two people, and I think she'd had enough.<eos> Martin Skittles from the pub. A few others.<eos> Jim, obviously.
When I came round, there was something in my mouth.<eos> Like thick material, gagging me.<eos> My hands were tied behind my back and he was on top of me.<eos> He smelt of drink.<eos> - What sort of drink?
Like thick material, gagging me.<eos> My hands were tied behind my back and he was on top of me.<eos> He smelt of drink.<eos> - What sort of drink?<eos> - Spirits.
He smelt of drink.<eos> - What sort of drink?<eos> - Spirits.<eos> I don't know why I remember that.<eos> Cheap spirits.
What did you do with your clothes from that night, Laura?<eos> I washed them. - Never wore them again.<eos> - Have you still got them?<eos> Did you speak to anyone about the attack at the time?<eos> My GP.
- Where were you fishing?<eos> - Off the beach.<eos> - Which beach?<eos> The one next to the sea.<eos> Between the caravan park and the cafe at Bartons End.
- Yep.<eos> - What route did you take?<eos> Same as usual.<eos> Out on the St Andrews Road, onto the coast road, down to the car park.<eos> - Same on the way back?
- Same on the way back.<eos> - That makes sense.<eos> - Glad you're happy.<eos> Except you didn't.<eos> Either way.
Ever been to Flintcombe Farm Shop?<eos> Yes. I used to do the IT support.<eos> The company I worked for had the contract.<eos> - Who did you deal with there?<eos> - The owner. Erm...
It's just I'm in the process of figuring out where to live.<eos> So... do you think I could rent one off you for a few weeks maybe?<eos> This weekend on?<eos> I thought you were living with whatshername.<eos> Sarah.
I didn't ask.<eos> Is that rude?<eos> We found a large stash of pornography on your computer.<eos> Was that the material which you shared with Michael Lucas?<eos> Some of it.
Lord, he is a ship's slave.<eos> In reality, Osbert's been given a fate far, far worse than death.<eos> You must understand Uhtred saved my life.<eos> He was my friend.<eos> Your friend?
And I have a name for you right here... in a letter of my own.<eos> A good man, godly man.<eos> Mercian stock, like the lady Aelswith.<eos> But what guarantee do I have... that Mercia will not become a mere appendage of Wessex?<eos> A poor cousin?
Help me!<eos> Dan... are you okay?<eos> For a while there, I could not remember anything.<eos> Everything feels like a dream.<eos> And not a good one.
Or did I dream that?<eos> No.<eos> I was there.<eos> I was so happy to hear your voice.<eos> With the woman.
Hildur.<eos> What are you doing out here?<eos> I came to talk to you, Erling.<eos> I'm here to see the digger man.<eos> - Kim Hopperstad? - Hmm.
Then why would an assassin leave Zurich to live in Fortitude?<eos> So... where are we with the Ledesma girl?<eos> We haven't located the whereabouts of, err... of Elena.<eos> Where are we with the, erm... the, err, murdered barman...<eos> - Tomak.
So... where are we with the Ledesma girl?<eos> We haven't located the whereabouts of, err... of Elena.<eos> Where are we with the, erm... the, err, murdered barman...<eos> - Tomak.<eos> - Tomak.
I think it was just too much.<eos> Everybody grieves in their own way.<eos> I used to lay awake at night thinkin' on the number 39.<eos> That was the number of lashes the overseer was allowed by Massa Slattery to give us.<eos> Not 40, not... 35, but... 39.
Funny how a memory can take hold of the senses.<eos> The smell, the taste.<eos> Make 'em mean something.<eos> What them berries taste like to you?<eos> Happiness.
Allow me to introduce myself, because, as you can see from my mole, we've never met before.<eos> As you can see from my coat, hat and ascot, I'm here on business.<eos> And as you can see from my sunglasses... it's bright out.<eos> I'm here to consult with you on the Baudelaire will, for which I understand you are the executioner.<eos> Executor.
Who knows what would happen to us on the street?<eos> At least here we have a roof over our head.<eos> I wish our parents' money could be used now, instead of when you come of age.<eos> Then we could buy a castle and live in it with armed guards patrolling outside to keep out Count Olaf and his troupe.<eos> - With a large inventing studio.

Is it a stretch for you?<eos> Well, as an actor, I think live theater is a much more powerful medium than, say, streaming television.<eos> And how do you respond to rumors that this whole production<eos> - is nothing more than an evil plot?<eos> - Evil plot?
I'm afraid this marriage is entirely binding.<eos> Violet... you said "I do" and signed this paper in your own hand.<eos> Count Olaf, you are now Violet's legal husband.<eos> And?<eos> And a vile and terrible person.
- You're blocking the screen! - I'm all right...<eos> - I'll go here. - Go that way.<eos> - That way? Aye, no. - Yes.<eos> I feel like your elbow tell me<eos> - and your hand, your finger...
I think we should send them away from the White House.<eos> What?<eos> My mom can help take care of them.<eos> I spoke with her.<eos> - With all due respect to your mom... - N-N-No.
She had her phone.<eos> Yes. But not her handbag.<eos> She must have left that in the car.<eos> Do you think it was that Mulberry bag I really liked?<eos> The dark brown one.
It can only be you, Dan.<eos> If you can see me in your heart, then you're Dan.<eos> If you keep me there, you will always be Dan.<eos> And Fortitude will be safe.<eos> Only Dan.
- I don't know.<eos> Kyle, you're a producer on the film.<eos> And I am feeling sick as a dog.<eos> Seriously.<eos> And a terrible liar.
Happy to cop to grand theft auto if you want to drop the rest of the beef.<eos> Go on.<eos> About the night of.<eos> We pull up. Jesse's driving.<eos> The Cadillac.
I left some things in the shed.<eos> If I could...<eos> Her stuff's in a storage locker downtown.<eos> They couldn't find her daughter.<eos> Just... an old friend.
Yeah, this is my city, I grew up here.<eos> A friend told me about CRT, and I thought, maybe, just maybe, it would...<eos> And I was right.<eos> Trying to help other people, it helps me somehow.<eos> At least sometimes.
- I think I locked it.<eos> Wasn't a forced entry though.<eos> So...<eos> So, uh... what should I do now?<eos> Uh, about what?
You've got it better than a lot of people.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> But everyone... is an asshole.<eos> No, not everyone.<eos> - Yes, and dildos. Yes.
So, what kind of relief work was it?<eos> The kind that completely backfires.<eos> I called it Operation Save the People because we wanted to go there and, uh... s-save people.<eos> My brother watched a documentary about Malawi one night after a party, a party where he found out that all our friends were calling us "trustafarians"<eos> behind our backs.
But... you're gonna see the playroom first.<eos> Junior, you don't have to do this.<eos> I-- I swear I'm gonna leave.<eos> What-Whatever Phil is gonna do with your Dad had--<eos> My dad?
What-Whatever Phil is gonna do with your Dad had--<eos> My dad?<eos> My father... is dead.<eos> He was a great man.<eos> A king.
"Let the lights of Broadway spangle. The girls wash off<eos> "the paint and go for their midnight sandwiches... "let 'em dream in the morning sun, late in the morning,<eos> "long after the morning papers, and dream as long as they want to in June somewhere..."<eos> You know, she fired him from the tour.<eos> Her own husband.
In that case, you can assist in tracking the demon.<eos> Stop saying that.<eos> Say what, "demon"?<eos> Well, that's precisely what it was,<eos> - a demon, hellion, foul specter.
Marines.<eos> Two tours.<eos> Afterward, Eric wrote my recommendations when I applied for Homeland.<eos> Sounds like a good man.<eos> The best.
How was Tokyo, huh?<eos> You go to that sushi place I told you about?<eos> Didn't have time.<eos> What a shame.<eos> Well, next time.
What the hell happened, man?<eos> Nothing. Just family trouble.<eos> You're married?<eos> No. Disagreement with my brother.<eos> That hardass?
Hell, he made half their careers.<eos> It's gonna be him and his cronies versus me.<eos> Alone.<eos> - Not alone.<eos> - Kim.
Jimmy.<eos> Jimmy.<eos> Howard.<eos> - Kim.<eos> - Chuck.
You go and get me another one.<eos> The -- the trick with the coin you told me about?<eos> I know your boss.<eos> I'm an investor here.<eos> Or the counterfeit bill?
You're like every other person in this building.<eos> Like you?<eos> You think I'm not on the books?<eos> I am.<eos> Under my own name.
Kevin, your faith in me is... it's... it means a lot.<eos> But when we first started working together, I promised you Mesa Verde would be my sole focus.<eos> And I meant it.<eos> - Well, sure, but I gotta take...<eos> - Hey there!
Oh, Mamacita, that's lovely.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> I believe I'll have the veal tonight, Michael, please.<eos> And Mamacita, I noticed you were eyeing the liver.<eos> Yeah, with onions.
My secret?<eos> Well, uh...<eos> I've always been a strict disciplinarian.<eos> Some people perhaps find that I've been too strict, especially with my first two...<eos> Christina and Christopher.
I think maybe sh...<eos> She was my only true female friend.<eos> You're lucky.<eos> Look, we don't have to be best pals.<eos> Just allies.
They start camp today.<eos> Two weeks.<eos> Of course.<eos> I guess I'm going to have to get used to it.<eos> To camp?
Of course.<eos> I guess I'm going to have to get used to it.<eos> To camp?<eos> No.<eos> To this.
Coming home to this awful silence.<eos> You deserve silence.<eos> Children are hard work.<eos> Once the work is done, silence is the reward.<eos> Reward?
Come on, you saw the piece in the Post.<eos> "Chicago deserves better" than an arrogant, dilettante billionaire playing games with "their safety."<eos> Well... I am arrogant.<eos> I am a billionaire.<eos> Dilettante? Yes.
I have something for you.<eos> And, Detective, try to keep overtime under $50 million.<eos> Um, so what about you?<eos> What now?<eos> Me?
Dumont, it's coming your way.<eos> Three, two, one, cue the mermaid!<eos> We're live, gents!<eos> - All right.<eos> - After you, my good man.
W-which hospital? Is he okay?<eos> Apparently, he had some sort of cardiac event.<eos> Is this a family member, or...<eos> Target's name is Adler, but we might be too late.<eos> - Mrs. Adler?
And now he's not?<eos> No, the Association has already arranged for a replacement.<eos> Well, I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that's not a coincidence.<eos> Exactly what part of the Internet do these secret keys control?<eos> All of it.
If we do that, we lose our best chance of catching the people behind those hijackings.<eos> Which is why I'm putting Tom and Solomon on board.<eos> He's been preparing your cover identities.<eos> So, what are we?<eos> Air Marshals?
Scottie's holding Whitehall inside Halcyon.<eos> We can't just walk him out.<eos> No.<eos> We have to break him out.<eos> Of Halcyon?
I need to speak with him to see if that's what you're doing.<eos> Well, you know, look at the bright side... when I'm done with you, no one will ever say,<eos> "He's more than just a pretty face."<eos> You know, why don't you spare me the theatrics... and just do it?<eos> With pleasure.
Hey, hey, hey.<eos> Stop, stop.<eos> He can't know anything.<eos> What's your angle here, hmm?<eos> With Howard?
Do I have an office?<eos> Just past the albino muskrat.<eos> This is gonna be nice.<eos> Corner office.<eos> With a window.
Where are they going?<eos> Sometimes, the best defense is offense.<eos> - I need a weapon.<eos> - You're an Israeli - Intelligence Agent, right?<eos> - A spy?
I'll keep an ear to the ground.<eos> - How 'bout that?<eos> - Christina, we are friends.<eos> Are we not?<eos> - Good friends.
You know who?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> - You talk to the cops?<eos> - What?<eos> - The police.
It made me feel like I'd finally broken through to something real.<eos> About my life and what I should be trying to do with it.<eos> Music.<eos> Starting this year, tomorrow.<eos> Amazing.
- Look who grew up over the summer.<eos> - Hey!<eos> Yo, be honest with me.<eos> You work on any houses?<eos> Any private homes?
- Hey!<eos> Yo, be honest with me.<eos> You work on any houses?<eos> Any private homes?<eos> Yeah, a couple.
- Where are you going?<eos> - To buy a dress.<eos> Because guess what?<eos> I'm also gong to the dance with Archie.<eos> And Veronica.
For Betty, and you didn't answer my question.<eos> I have never felt...<eos> Whatever it is I'm supposed to feel with Betty.<eos> Have you felt it, though?<eos> With anyone?
Thanks.<eos> Uh, can I sit, Jughead?<eos> If you want.<eos> - What are you working on?<eos> - My novel.
My mom says i should never speak to you again.<eos> But i...<eos> Even though you don't like me like that,<eos> I still want us to be friends...<eos> Best friends.
Were you alone?<eos> No, sir.<eos> Who were you with?<eos> Let's make it a 4th of July you'll never forget.<eos> My dog, Vegas.
Yeah.<eos> Maybe you can show me.<eos> Yes. Yes, I... I can do that.<eos> - When?<eos> - Tomorrow night.
Lincoln Center, all the big symphonies, but I didn't make the cut.<eos> Not even close.<eos> I had a dream.<eos> Sometimes that's all they are.<eos> Just dreams.
Mutual annihilation.<eos> - Agreed.<eos> - So, can't we just...<eos> Be friends?<eos> Or, at least, frenemies?
You tell me.<eos> Before I sold my first song, I was in the studio all day.<eos> Waitering and bartending all night.<eos> There's no short-cuts, unless you're a prodigy.<eos> Definitely not a prodigy.
Not them.<eos> Cheryl.<eos> You're allowed to say goodbye to your brother.<eos> - But, why does it have to be...<eos> - In front of people?
Working with Archie how?<eos> Co-writing songs.<eos> - Singing with him.<eos> - Unacceptable. You sing with the Pussycats.<eos> Or with Archie.
Co-writing songs.<eos> - Singing with him.<eos> - Unacceptable. You sing with the Pussycats.<eos> Or with Archie.<eos> But not both.
What's going on?<eos> That SoDale contract?<eos> Awarded to Andrew's Construction. Looks like you won.<eos> You're...<eos> With Jason's...
Well, since they shut down the drive-in.<eos> That's where I was living before.<eos> Why the hell are you not living at home?<eos> The truth is, things aren't good at home.<eos> - With your dad?
I believe you, Jughead.<eos> Honey?<eos> What did you say to Polly when you found out that she was pregnant?<eos> Did you make an appointment for her?<eos> With a doctor?
What did you say to Polly when you found out that she was pregnant?<eos> Did you make an appointment for her?<eos> With a doctor?<eos> That you offered to pay for?<eos> Behind my back?
Let's just say that there are some things about myself that I struggle with.<eos> I trust Jughead, Mom.<eos> Of course you do.<eos> And you should.<eos> But just not with everything.
I don't think it's gonna work out.<eos> Irreconcilable differences.<eos> Don't run away from it. Don't run away.<eos> You've got something good here.<eos> With her, with your friends.
I doubt they're that stupid...<eos> We'll switch...<eos> I'll take the bedroom this time. You wanted to see if we would find anything incriminating, and we didn't.<eos> Then we'll look somewhere else.<eos> Outside or under the trailer.
If Daddy wasn't mad at Jason about Polly, it must have been about the business.<eos> I don't know if he heard something he shouldn't have, or he saw something he didn't like...<eos> You don't know what you're saying...<eos> What was Jay-Jay running away from?<eos> The business?
I don't know if he heard something he shouldn't have, or he saw something he didn't like...<eos> You don't know what you're saying...<eos> What was Jay-Jay running away from?<eos> The business?<eos> Daddy?
You don't know what you're saying...<eos> What was Jay-Jay running away from?<eos> The business?<eos> Daddy?<eos> You?
They're not fucking around.<eos> They buried Meachum for letting that thumb drive get away.<eos> And what do you get out of it?<eos> - I disappear. - What?<eos> With the diamonds?
Did you travel here?<eos> Any family you want to talk to?<eos> Anybody you want us to contact for you?<eos> How old are you?<eos> Over 18?
I don't know.<eos> I guess.<eos> I feel like I've been here.<eos> Can you go with me?<eos> With you?
Of course he did.<eos> He suckered you into picking his damn jury for him.<eos> - So, you're a good American?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - And a hero?
You know, the kids in Davy, they dare one another to walk Witch Light Road on full moons.<eos> It's got a bit of a ghost town vibe, but people seem nice.<eos> Do they?<eos> Some folks say she's a witch.<eos> Or a lesbian.
Are you gonna teach me to throw that thing or what? Let's go.<eos> Show me how you grip it.<eos> That'll work.<eos> So, lob... Or heat?<eos> Heat.
Or a wave of bright, shining futures?<eos> Isn't that what he said at the unveiling assembly?<eos> Either way, I like it.<eos> Alice, watcha workin' on?<eos> A new commemorative coin rendering.
Drop that!<eos> Drop the knife right now!<eos> Put your hands behind your head.<eos> Tell us what you did with the gun.<eos> What gun?
I guess I was hopin' that maybe you'd... be happy.<eos> I... I'm just supposed to be happy?<eos> I'm dealin' with serious matters here.<eos> I... I'm dealin' with...<eos> with your people
I'm dealin' with serious matters here.<eos> I... I'm dealin' with...<eos> with your people<eos> - attacking' my family.<eos> - My people?
Don't go sounding' no alarm.<eos> We'll be in and out in jackrabbit time.<eos> Just goin' to grab us some libations and be on our way.<eos> Here's a little somethin' from us to you.<eos> With our thanks.
I didn't shoot nobody.<eos> We already know what happened.<eos> Okay, you help yourself if you talk to us.<eos> Tell us what you did with the gun.<eos> - What gun?
He is the very definition of a flight risk, Your Honor.<eos> All that is, strictly speaking, true, Your Honor... but Mr. Farrell has no prior criminal record and it does not appear that the prosecution has given enough evidence in order...<eos> I think I've heard enough, Ms. Bennett.<eos> Bail is denied.<eos> Hey, Ledda.
You are scared of them, plain and simple.<eos> Wha... hey, wait a minute here.<eos> What's this about?<eos> The other day you're saying this has nothing to do<eos> - with the Farrells.
Mother!<eos> What?<eos> Was jim blackwell driving a car?<eos> Yes.<eos> A '90s silver and black lincoln?
Forget about all this, okay?<eos> Don't ever do that to me again.<eos> I won't.<eos> Are you coming?<eos> Right behind you.
Maybe.<eos> Yeah, I don't... I don't think so, though.<eos> But... but thank you.<eos> Thank you for helping me with the car.<eos> With... with everything.
I'm gonna pretend that didn't just happen right now.<eos> W-we have to focus on getting rid of Sam's body, step by step.<eos> We deal with the rest later.<eos> We can't use the lake this time, so we have to choose between the cliff and the woods.<eos> - "This time"?
Uh, she's in... she's in the field.<eos> - Is there anyone else here?<eos> - No.<eos> Okay, collect their firearms.<eos> Nice and easy, thumb and forefinger only.
I gotta see about a girl.<eos> It's too late, man.<eos> Jamie's gone.<eos> No, I know.<eos> Not her.
No, no, I don't need you to buy me a beer.<eos> What are friends for?<eos> Sorry about what happened to Kevin.<eos> He was a good kid.<eos> Good man.
Yeah, so?<eos> Anil Vemuri?<eos> I'm Willa.<eos> We emailed about your time working with Arthur.<eos> Um, Dr. Foreman and Dr. Frost.
The question becomes, you think she knows that we know that she knows we're not handsome?<eos> That's too much thinking for me.<eos> Hey, how's, how's Allie doing?<eos> You talk?<eos> A bit.
I knew Maya.<eos> Can I come in?<eos> I met her in a labor camp.<eos> - Where?<eos> - Outside the colony.
You want to talk about your boyfriend, Pastor Ian?<eos> My boyfriend?<eos> What am I? Fourteen?<eos> Well, what would you call the guy you're seeing who isn't my dad?<eos> A good friend.
He calls you Judge sir.<eos> - Good.<eos> And no late nights...<eos> And definitely no screaming and shouting!<eos> Except for...
- Good.<eos> And no late nights...<eos> And definitely no screaming and shouting!<eos> Except for...<eos> - Except for?
The number you're trying to call is currently busy.<eos> Busy my foot...<eos> you just hit the jackpot.<eos> Do you know who you're going to work with on the project?<eos> Shahrukh Khan.
Busy my foot...<eos> you just hit the jackpot.<eos> Do you know who you're going to work with on the project?<eos> Shahrukh Khan.<eos> One and only...
When did you arrive?<eos> But your office colleagues returned yesterday.<eos> And you...where were you?<eos> I just told you, Ahmadabad.<eos> With whom?
Because you're my only daughter...and I worry for you.<eos> If I wasn't your only daughter would you have worried any less for me?<eos> Stop this nonsense, Tara.<eos> None of your office colleagues knew where you were.<eos> And with whom?
Are you going to stay in Mumbai for business or go back?<eos> I've to go to the office, mom.<eos> Why didn't you come back with us in the train? I couldn't make it on time, missed the train.<eos> Where were you?<eos> - And with whom?
Come, let's go home.<eos> Charu aunty. Let's go home.<eos> Paplu.<eos> Thank God I found you Paplu, or you would've been lost.<eos> Then what about me?
- Doctor.<eos> - Inspector. Adult male. Earlyto mid-twenties.<eos> Died some time between eight and midnight last night.<eos> Strangled with a ligature about the thickness of my finger.<eos> Sash cord, perhaps?
I spent most of the evening on the telephone to colleagues in New York and, later, California.<eos> I'm planning a big tour for the boys there next month.<eos> With The Kinks.<eos> On "eyes", you walk it down to the G.<eos> A. G sharp.
You wanted to see me?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Bloke dropped it off at the front desk.<eos> Oh, Sergeant. Any developments on this labourer?<eos> - Barry Finch, sir.
Mummy! Mummy, please!<eos> Don't! It's for your own good, Bettina.<eos> You're not kind.<eos> You're wicked.<eos> And godless.
Well... it's unlikely, but it isn't impossible.<eos> I handled it a lot.<eos> Yes, I thought about that.<eos> However, there is one place where it would have been impossible for you to leave your thumb print.<eos> Under the stamp.
What is it you're looking for?<eos> Can I help?<eos> Pippa was sleeping with Nick. Is that right?<eos> Yes. On and off.<eos> And Barry Finch.
The one who loved me beyond all fear and all horror.<eos> So do not doubt how much your child will love you, or how little she will see of the things that worry you.<eos> What happened?<eos> She died.<eos> Along with my sister.
My husband wouldn't give me permission.<eos> Hello, Marnie, sweetheart.<eos> Hello, Dot.<eos> - You her vicar?<eos> - Curate, yes.
Dot... I've come to talk to you about your offer.<eos> I wish Eugene was here.<eos> He's at his salon, seeing a supplier.<eos> Sugar?<eos> One and a bit.
I am no Marie Antoinette.<eos> I will not eat cake while my sister moulders in the asylum.<eos> I will not eat at all until I am assured she is unharmed.<eos> Whatever the pain was, it wasn't contractions.<eos> Practice ones maybe.
I just came for my camera. That's it.<eos> Jennifer... would you excuse us for a second?<eos> She was a threat to you, sir. To... To your candidacy,<eos> - to everything that we've worked for.<eos> - A threat?
Everything. Liquidated, cash.<eos> $7,945,400.<eos> Sir, again, we don't keep that kind of money on-site.<eos> You... you can't just have it wired here, and then come by the bank and withdraw it.<eos> Not in cash. Whoa, whoa!
Know him?<eos> On the board of half a dozen nonprofits.<eos> Academy of the Arts, Goodman Theater, Joffrey.<eos> He sees your wife at least twice a week.<eos> Sometimes more.
Your father?<eos> About Aunt Carlotta.<eos> You never answered my question.<eos> What should my father do about a woman who steals from him?<eos> A loyal woman.
About Aunt Carlotta.<eos> You never answered my question.<eos> What should my father do about a woman who steals from him?<eos> A loyal woman.<eos> A mother.
I don't want to.<eos> It makes me sad.<eos> Please don't look at me like that, Noah.<eos> - Like what?<eos> - With all that judgment.
If you're objective about it, it's just a switch.<eos> Do you ever think that the reason you haven't got him in 17 years is that you're underestimating him?<eos> There is a powerful intelligence at work here, a deep personal philosophy underpinning all of FC's actions.<eos> Now, you figure out the philosophy, you can figure out the man, you can crack the code.<eos> But not with this.
You have no idea.<eos> No idea. ♪ everybody, it's a good thing ♪<eos> ♪ everybody wants a good thing ♪<eos> ♪ everybody ♪<eos> - Next.
Because of mistakes I made.<eos> Terrible mistakes.<eos> I would only be a distraction if I stayed.<eos> - So, where will you go?<eos> - Volantis.
We'll have baths drawn for you and supper sent to your rooms.<eos> Am I your prisoner?<eos> Not yet.<eos> Our ironborn and Dornish allies were attacked en route to Dorne.<eos> - And?
My brother promised me he'd keep a grip on the Lannister forces.<eos> Forgive me, but I don't care about any Lannister promises.<eos> Except yours.<eos> And I promised him I'd keep you from doing anything impulsive.<eos> Impulsive?
- with your brother in King's Landing?<eos> - I'm trying to serve you by planning for the long term.<eos> Perhaps if you'd planned for the short term, we wouldn't have lost Dorne and Highgarden.<eos> We will discuss the succession after I wear the crown.<eos> A bear.
Our technology's come so far over the years making a sample doesn't take that long.<eos> Oh, by the way...<eos> We got another delivery of infected bodies.<eos> A lot.<eos> More than 30.
The sequence is extremely close to the parasitic weapons used by the Los Iluminados cult.<eos> You think Arias might be one of them?<eos> Based on information I have now, I'm not sure.<eos> Looks like we should go talk to a real expert.<eos> Real expert?
It's fate.<eos> Wait.<eos> Where are you going with this?<eos> I'm redoing the wedding.<eos> This time with you.
Couldn't even hold a knife and a fork.<eos> I had to cut his steak for him.<eos> You and Billy. More than friends?<eos> Pals.<eos> Just pals.
You know, I didn't know them.<eos> I didn't even know their names.<eos> We hear he might have had a falling out with some of them.<eos> Well, that'd be news to me. Cause, he was talking about how great it was gonna be this time and how much money they were all gonna make.<eos> This time?
Well, it's certainly going to be an adventure.<eos> Any news on your replacement, pastor Tim?<eos> We're still searching, but we have some very interesting possibilities.<eos> Not too interesting, I hope.<eos> Oh, definitely not.
You mean this Tuesday?<eos> What?<eos> You have big weekend plans?<eos> Oh, yeah, got a round of golf<eos> With the father-in-law.
Three weeks.<eos> Chief, S.E. Is retiring in six, he wants you there three weeks with him before he hands over the reins.<eos> It's the Soviet division, everything gets done right.<eos> I've been thinking.<eos> About pastor Tim.
Pray for forgiveness.<eos> He hated me for it.<eos> "Town slut," he called me.<eos> You have nothing to be forgiven for.<eos> All right, nothing.
Why go along with all this?<eos> Whatever else she was, she's still my wife.<eos> They gave me that back.<eos> Where is she now?<eos> With him.
Holly, are you okay?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Hiding.<eos> From your mom?<eos> From you.
Well, if you ask instead of take, I would have told you that Grandma didn't bring in the watch. Bank manager with gambling problem did.<eos> I know that now.<eos> We found my father's watch in the back of a drawer, and I wanted to come here and apologize and make it right.<eos> - I let you walk. - Okay.<eos> Under one condition:
Liv basically kicked us out of the office for watching her grind with the next President, so Charlie and I are gonna celebrate with a drink at the Old Rail.<eos> - Want to come?<eos> - I'm busy.<eos> Busy?<eos> With what?
I've got a lot of work to plow through.<eos> I don't want your blood on my carpet.<eos> Olivia Pope.<eos> This is a Global Tel Link, prepaid call from...<eos> Cyrus Beene.
I'm not sure how to describe him.<eos> Then don't, motherfucker.<eos> Keep your fucking mouth shut.<eos> Take this punk back to West Hollywood and drop him on the street.<eos> Our pleasure.
Shit happens in Hollywood.<eos> We've been talking to him about Billy Meadows' murder.<eos> No shit.<eos> He was a suspect?<eos> Witness.
What can I tell you?<eos> She showed me I.D. She signed the form.<eos> She paid the bond.<eos> How'd she pay?<eos> Cash.
- I am focusing.<eos> Or trying to.<eos> We've been sitting here for 10 minutes and the lamp is still off.<eos> You were the one bragging about how you could help me with my... But I'm not gonna say it.<eos> Powers!
Not even her name.<eos> I had to find out from one of your old research assistants.<eos> I... I did it to protect you.<eos> To protect me?<eos> From what?
I had to find out from one of your old research assistants.<eos> I... I did it to protect you.<eos> To protect me?<eos> From what?<eos> From the truth?
I thought...<eos> There's this support group... They're called Hollow Sky... For people who have lost loved ones.<eos> My older brother died.<eos> But Ian showed us how to transform our pain into something... positive.<eos> Beyond this world.
I need to go home.<eos> We can talk later. All right?<eos> Where should I drop you?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Sometime last night.
Fuck.<eos> He's here.<eos> He's here.<eos> You should be with me.<eos> Not Sean.
Far too much. Yeah.<eos> It's good to see you writin' again.<eos> Rayna wants to do another album.<eos> That's great.<eos> With me.
Yeah.<eos> You are an awesome performer.<eos> Do you play gigs at all or...<eos> I don't know.<eos> Sometimes.
Do you even realize how lucky you are?<eos> You should be having the time of your life right now!<eos> Instead of whining about everything, And being a total bitch!<eos> Get out!<eos> Gladly.
She mouthed off to the artist.<eos> Got her butt canned. No!<eos> Yeah.<eos> Called her a bitch, right?<eos> Right there in front of everybody.
What do you think we should do about it?<eos> I'll talk to gary.<eos> See if I can salvage the situation.<eos> Well, did you talk to her?<eos> Her?
We can't do our best work if you're in too much pain.<eos> I'm not.<eos> I swear.<eos> I think I could do something even more advanced.<eos> Maybe next session.
You're a social worker?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I work with families in crisis.<eos> That's amazing.<eos> Sometimes.
You know, since I'm such a baby and all.<eos> Come on, Maddie.<eos> We're friends.<eos> Right.<eos> Friends.
What's happening here?<eos> - Is she okay?<eos> - She's having a bad day.<eos> You made me look like an idiot<eos> - in front of everyone!
Because, you know, Clay and I, we're older and we...<eos> Does it hurt?<eos> Does what hurt?<eos> Being in love.<eos> Sometimes.
We are artificially supporting her blood pressure at this point.<eos> And her organs are failing.<eos> No!<eos> "She was my North, my South,<eos> "My East and West.
No!<eos> "She was my North, my South,<eos> "My East and West.<eos> "My working week, my Sunday rest.<eos> "My Noon...
- doesn't mean I'm a monster.<eos> - Yeah, well, no one's saying that.<eos> I feel like he can't see that I'm doing this for Rayna.<eos> I'm doing this for her company, for her legacy.<eos> Maybe with time...
It's just the most beautiful kind of crazy.<eos> And it scares the hell out of me.<eos> There's one thing I've learned.<eos> I just got to jump right into the heart of that fear.<eos> Especially with this man.
How you doing?<eos> "Sanctimonious and saccharine."<eos> You took a risk.<eos> Sometimes that pays off.<eos> Sometimes...
Please just say you'll try with me.<eos> I want my next album to be a gospel album.<eos> You took a risk.<eos> Sometimes that pays off,<eos> - sometimes...
- Yeah, that was Erika at the Bluebird.<eos> She wants to know if you might want to play a Writers in the Round tomorrow night.<eos> Let me call you right back.<eos> All right, thanks.<eos> - Tomorrow night?
Well, it's one of the brain's earliest defense systems, like playing dead.<eos> Some people faint, some people have what you have.<eos> Some people become catatonic.<eos> Defense against what?<eos> Trauma.
I want you to take in deep breaths, slow.<eos> Slow...<eos> Breathe deep.<eos> And I want you to concentrate on your safe place.<eos> My what?
Look, this was just sort of sprung on me, I mean, you haven't even looked at the bloody appetizers, and guess what, I'm a father.<eos> This was a mistake.<eos> Yo! Yo, this is your house?<eos> Yo, you guys like billionaires or something?<eos> - No, musicians.
In your musical McMansion?<eos> Yeah, I'm sure your parents would approve.<eos> No, it's just Deacon, he'll be fine with it.<eos> What's a Deacon?<eos> My step dad.
Please tell me you're here to teach me Excel.<eos> Hell, no.<eos> How's Maddie?<eos> Ah, well, she's a teenager.<eos> Full of idealism.
- You must be excited too.<eos> - Uh, yeah, I am.<eos> You are our favorite couple.<eos> Can I get a picture?<eos> Like in the front of the van.
It means that sometimes we get so caught up in someone, we don't see that someone is very different than what we thought.<eos> Am I missing something here?<eos> Yes.<eos> And I would be very careful if I were you.<eos> Of what?
- It's all good.<eos> She's not just gonna be a baby.<eos> - She's gonna be a child and a teenager.<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> - And a woman with dreams.
He's just a... a really angry guy.<eos> And, you know, he's got a new life now.<eos> So he's happy.<eos> Yeah, well, he married his assistant or something?<eos> - My assistant... - Oh. And best friend.
Well, look who's on the bill tonight.<eos> Hello, Brad.<eos> If I had known, I would have brought Jake along.<eos> - He'd love to see him mom play.<eos> - Well, maybe next time.
You think this is about Brad?<eos> This isn't about Brad.<eos> I'd be happy to never think about him for as long as I live.<eos> It's about our son who... he's killing day by day.<eos> Cruelty by cruelty.
Highway 65's financial struggles over the years, they haven't exactly been a big secret, you know.<eos> So if the label's in trouble, I'd like to help out.<eos> I think you and I have very different definitions of the word "help."<eos> Just so you know, off the record... I'd be interested.<eos> - In what?
But have you ever truly trusted anybody?<eos> Okay, I'm not doing this now, not here.<eos> Me?<eos> Caleb?<eos> Even Avery?
I've made lots of mistakes.<eos> What do you think about... about spending a little more time up in the Green Zone with your aunt and your cousin?<eos> Like when Daddy left to find Charlie?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, just like that. [sniffles]<eos> You and me this time, right?
I found Devon.<eos> She helped me get to Charlie.<eos> I lost my transit pass, so I couldn't come back here legally.<eos> We went to a coyote who had a plan to go over the wall.<eos> Over?
Met her at the gym.<eos> What is she, your trainer?<eos> Actually, no.<eos> She's an editor.<eos> Really? What kind of editor?
You fucking hate this place!<eos> Why are you here?<eos> Your grandfather left it to me.<eos> To you?<eos> Not to Nina?
There's a process in place for a reason, Alison.<eos> No, I understand, thanks for coming by.<eos> Would you mind telling us where you were last Wednesday night?<eos> He was home.<eos> With me.
Yes.<eos> You knew that when you left Buenos Aires?<eos> I knew that the day I met you.<eos> You got married.<eos> To the wrong woman.
Oh, Meg! Am I right?<eos> That's me.<eos> You're Jenny's best friend.<eos> I was.<eos> Who?
If things go well and you meet our expectations, there is a scenario where we set our sights, well... higher.<eos> Have you ever considered running for public office, Ms. Whelan?<eos> A little inside information...<eos> In this town, a person wields far more power from the shadows than as some state senator or junior congresswoman.<eos> What about as president?
Do you know a Rachel Duncan?<eos> Oh, we do now.<eos> Yeah, this is a big day for all of us.<eos> - She's in seclusion with Him.<eos> - With who?
Oh, we do now.<eos> Yeah, this is a big day for all of us.<eos> - She's in seclusion with Him.<eos> - With who?<eos> The founder!
- With who?<eos> The founder!<eos> We're all his children here.<eos> You lost me.<eos> Who-whose children?
Well then, I got my eye on you, Fritz.<eos> Wee bit harsh, chef.<eos> Now the bloody Scotch is telling me what to say to the bloody Fritz.<eos> And to think, chef, I was gonna invite you to the Cafe De Paris with us.<eos> But not with that attitude.
Just make sure it can't be traced to either of us.<eos> No shit.<eos> This has to be it, Harry.<eos> Just do this, and everything's jake.<eos> Always with the pickles.
It saved his life.<eos> Any word?<eos> He'll live.<eos> Cautiously optimistic they can save the arm.<eos> Cautiously optimistic.
I'm delighted.<eos> The mayor will be thrilled. Does he know?<eos> I wanted to tell you first.<eos> Yeah, extra... extra spicy. - You ever work with him?<eos> - Rudy?
Simple as that.<eos> Welcome to what-a-burger.<eos> Can I take your order?<eos> Thirty sausage biscuits, 30 hash browns... With egg and...<eos> Egg and cheese on those, please.
They have us busy all week.<eos> - I ain't showered, so...<eos> - Did you sleep with another girl?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> What girl?
♪ everybody knows that my damn name's Zurich ♪ - ♪ hey ♪<eos> - ZURICH: ♪ come through ♪<eos> ♪ you know this shit, we earned it ♪<eos> ♪ chilling with my Nigga square I mean his name is Ernest ♪<eos> Ernest!
You're his mortal enemy, Supergirl.<eos> The person he fears most.<eos> You will take everything from him, so, this time, he will not hesitate.<eos> This time, he will protect his planet.<eos> - This time...
That will save us ten million on this trade.<eos> This is why I need to keep you.<eos> I'd believe the same thing were I you.<eos> - Whoa! - You've been served.<eos> - With a lawsuit?
My grandson!<eos> Congratulations, Henry.<eos> Oh, God smiles on us.<eos> We must praise him with a mass.<eos> With a wedding.
See you tomorrow.<eos> Every time something happens like this morning, it's a reminder of what's important.<eos> Humans are stomping down other humans because nobody thinks we can beat the Raps, but we're gonna change all that.<eos> How?<eos> With your help.
All of his blood cell counts have bottomed out.<eos> Add that to the vomiting, the skin and lung abnormalities, the loss of hair--<eos> What is it?<eos> It's been a long time since medical school, but sure as hell looks to me like he's been exposed to radiation.<eos> Radiation?
Because you were involved.<eos> You're just throwing shit against the wall and hoping it sticks.<eos> This is your wife.<eos> On the subway platform... before the attack on our Host.<eos> With Broussard.
He cut out for Dodge City first light.<eos> Join up with Wyatt Earp.<eos> Where is he?<eos> Georgia.<eos> Midnight train.
Asked the band to play Walk to the Peak.<eos> Guess it was His favorite.<eos> Other than that?<eos> He was a customer.<eos> A customer?
Student.<eos> Beautiful.<eos> Like a model, only with talking and thinking.<eos> She looked at you and you perved.<eos> Every time, automatic.
Every time, automatic.<eos> Like physics.<eos> Eye contact, perversion.<eos> So I gave her extra chips.<eos> Every time, extra chips.
That's me, that's my face, but...<eos> It's wrong.<eos> - Hey!<eos> - Sorry.<eos> Some other time.
- There's no need to kill the rest.<eos> - I'll say what is needed, convict.<eos> - Drugs weren't part of the deal.<eos> - Your deal, not ours.<eos> - Yeah. - Warden.
- I don't know.<eos> This whole thing feels off.<eos> Promise me, this is the last one.<eos> I can't lose you.<eos> - On one condition.
So no, doctor, our system is not broken, we are not headed down the wrong path.<eos> I'm doing my job for society.<eos> Whether you are or not is yet to be seen.<eos> - What about compassion and empathy?<eos> And mercy?
My home number's on the back.<eos> Well, I'm sure that won't be necessary.<eos> Well, if you can think of anything.<eos> A policeman?<eos> A detective.
It's not Daisy's fault.<eos> There's no fault in love, surely?<eos> Provided nobody else gets hurt.<eos> - Has somebody been hurt?<eos> - Not in this instance, no.
- What did you tell him?<eos> - That I wouldn't do it.<eos> - I bet that went over well.<eos> - Well, we sort of made a deal.<eos> - A deal with renard?
Before I announce my decision,<eos> You're gonna have to prove your loyalty. And not just to the mayor's office...<eos> I'm ready anytime...<eos> You got everything you need?<eos> Except for the hair.
Well, I think we all wished for that.<eos> Didn't do much good, did it?<eos> - Not really.<eos> - both:<eos> Well, except for that last wish.
What exactly does that mean?<eos> Our goals have not changed.<eos> We want you to pick up where we left off.<eos> You mean with everyone dead?<eos> Except you.
And we didn't know this until later, but the reason Ada was going mad was because of an Alpe.<eos> These are definitely not teeth.<eos> Yeah, I don't know if there's a word for them, but, uh, I know what they do.<eos> They get inside your head, and feed.<eos> - On what?
Not me!<eos> Monster!<eos> You ever thought about what you want done?<eos> With what?<eos> - You.
Obviously, you're here about Dr. Hampton.<eos> Do come in.<eos> Uh, get the door behind you, please.<eos> When was the last time you talked to her?<eos> Uh, last night.
And then his son was killed.<eos> What were you and your friends doing with those bodies?<eos> Were they Wesen?<eos> Were they what?<eos> Wesen.
Oh, crap.<eos> So what do we do now?<eos> You can't arrest a tree.<eos> After what it did to Rosalee, I'm fine to chop it down and cut it into firewood.<eos> With all those faces in there?
He must be cold.<eos> - Sure looks it. - He's human.<eos> That is not what he looked like in the Other Place.<eos> This guy doesn't look like skull guy...<eos> Except for the staff.
Diana.<eos> I'm sorry for a lot of that stuff.<eos> Me too.<eos> I wish I'd never heard of those damn keys... or Black Claw.<eos> Or Bonaparte or this.
Will 'ee ask her, or shall I?<eos> As to that, I believe the Lord will guide us.<eos> Do 'ee believe 'tis all his plan?<eos> For instance, do he decree us to meet yon souls up yonder?<eos> Maybe so, brother.
Knowing them, it'll find them anyway.<eos> As it oft seems to find you?<eos> Those days are done.<eos> I'm a respectable country squire now.<eos> With a home, a mine, a family and a wife.
These people, you know them?<eos> Of course. They're our tenants.<eos> Francis always felt it was important to be on good terms with them...<eos> But then he'd grown up in the district.<eos> With an ancient family name.
50... for him... and 50 for me.<eos> When do you return?<eos> Beware, monsieur.<eos> The Republic is watchful.<eos> Tonight.
In my room.<eos> Shall we go and inspect them?<eos> My apologies, mademoiselle, I omitted to mention... I'm married, with a child.<eos> - I'm not.<eos> - Tholly.
Mr and Mrs Warleggan and Miss Chynoweth.<eos> There's Lord Falmouth.<eos> Now who here might effect an introduction?<eos> Miss Penvenen And Mistress Poldark.<eos> Extraordinary!
Who are you?<eos> Captain Ross Poldark. You?<eos> Lieutenant Armitage of the Espion.<eos> Sir, I think these men have no business here.<eos> No business with you.
How could your husband foresee that in freeing his friend, he'd liberate a man he'd never met?<eos> Well, I hope that whatever consequence come of this liberty, you'll take full advantage of it.<eos> Oh, believe me, Ma'am, I intend to.<eos> He was here?<eos> Under my very nose.
Did I mention I've had good news from Harrow?<eos> Geoffrey Charles is to start there next term.<eos> George has set a trap.<eos> Judas! Then he's walkin' straight into it!<eos> After 'em!
Of course he's aware.<eos> Which is why he imports, hoards and sells to the highest bidder.<eos> Riot and theft will not help these people, so, what will?<eos> Say nothing of her misdemeanour.<eos> - But surely...
Men.<eos> Good day to thee, sir.<eos> See the fruits of your generosity!<eos> Have you come to make further donation?<eos> - Donation?
Because she belonged to Ross and closing' her will hurt 'im.<eos> So, to spite Ross, George would send 70 families into direst poverty?<eos> 'Tis about the size of it.<eos> I'm to be sent back to Trenwith?<eos> Along with Geoffrey Charles.
Judas! Then he's walking straight into it! I must go and stop him!<eos> Nay, maid.<eos> Not a word to Ross!<eos> That way!<eos> After 'em!
It was you, wasn't it?<eos> Lord, I'll miss you!<eos> Uncle George is sending me away to school.<eos> Then I'll miss 'ee, too.<eos> And Miss Morwenna.
You've been a great friend to me, Drake, so I've brought you a gift.<eos> No, Master Geoffrey, 'tis enough to have had your friendship.<eos> You can open it later if you'd rather.<eos> I'll be offended if you don't take it.<eos> On one condition.
Tom Harry said its worth could be upward of 40 shillings.<eos> Damn it.<eos> What?<eos> Theft of goods worth 40 shillings or more is a capital offence.<eos> Capital?
Geoffrey Charles... is a child whose emotions are easily played on.<eos> Your brotherinlaw insinuated himself into his affections, into this household, where he contrived to steal a valuable family item, hoping no doubt to turn it into ready money.<eos> He's a Methodist. How likely is that?<eos> Furthermore, he callously engaged the affections of an impressionable young girl, and finally, deliberately polluted my grounds on several occasions this summer.<eos> With what?
Forgive me. I was disagreeably detained.<eos> By whom?<eos> George Warleggan. And Reverend Whitworth.<eos> I can't decide which encounter was the more unpleasant.<eos> In what regard?
The Iliad?<eos> At which part are you now?<eos> Patroclus has just been slain by Hector, and now there is a terrible fight about his body.<eos> For as you know, Vicar, it is of great importance to the Greeks that the funeral rites be performed in full upon the body.<eos> The body, y-yes...
Shall we pretend this is our wedding night?<eos> No pretence needed.<eos> Every night is our wedding night to me.<eos> Lieutenant Armitage was most attentive today.<eos> - To whom?
No pretence needed.<eos> Every night is our wedding night to me.<eos> Lieutenant Armitage was most attentive today.<eos> - To whom?<eos> - Your wife.
- No-one's ever written me poetry before.<eos> - Not even your husband?<eos> Ross has been called many things but "poetic" is not one of them!<eos> May I see you again?<eos> And Ross, too, of course.
Should we also suppose that they're sick of the favours they enjoy, the business that comes their way in exchange for those votes?<eos> In the coming Truro by-election, many have indicated their willingness to defy Falmouth.<eos> And instead of voting for his candidate, vote for yours?<eos> We both agree change is long overdue.<eos> - With the right man in place...
Power is pursued for its own sake rather than the good it can do.<eos> Who am I to claim exemption from these failings?<eos> Will you not even try?<eos> I cannot believe I would emerge from this process with my soul intact.<eos> Your soul?
Who am I to claim exemption from these failings?<eos> Will you not even try?<eos> I cannot believe I would emerge from this process with my soul intact.<eos> Your soul?<eos> Your stubbornness!
In consideration of the very great sacrifice I would be making, to my principles, to my reputation... .. the very least I could accept is £700.<eos> I've pleaded with him, Vicar, but he says there are things I do not understand.<eos> We will need a cottage.<eos> With furnishings.<eos> And a garden.
Sorry, I caught a ride with Julio this morning.<eos> Well, Sanchez is here.<eos> - Where's Nolan?<eos> - He left a few minutes ago to go take care of something else.<eos> "Something else"?
Guys, that job was a shit show, no question.<eos> We're all pissed.<eos> I get it.<eos> But the smart thing to do right now is to take a beat and just cool out.<eos> Cool out.
You pay her. I'm not paying her.<eos> I wish she'd have dropped me and Julia off at a firehouse door the day she had us.<eos> What's going on with you guys?<eos> Nothin'.<eos> The same as you.
You know what? Never mind.<eos> - I'll figure it out.<eos> - That's great, thank you.<eos> I mean, just real quick, and forgive me, but how do I know the difference between a bad sunburn and sunstroke?<eos> Vomit.
I don't know whether I'd pass you or not, because the fact is, you're engaged to a man who pretended to be a lawyer.<eos> And I find it hard to believe that you didn't know about it the whole time.<eos> And since then, he's paid his dues.<eos> And what about you?<eos> What about me?
He just smiled and said,<eos> "Lily, what the hell are you talking about?<eos> "We achieved something together that neither one of us could have done on our own."<eos> Our sons...<eos> Harvey and Marcus.
So, the only thing you succeeded in doing was bringing us all together.<eos> Oh, Eleanor. That's it!<eos> My big mistake was bringing you all together, having you be soul mates living next to each other.<eos> Next time, I'll spread you out so it's more of a slow burn.<eos> - Uh, next time?
A bear in hibernation does not rest as much as my young brother.<eos> Perhaps a touch from "St. Claude" can miraculously revive him.<eos> You know that your sister has put her "saintly" days behind her.<eos> Clearly, as she has now taken up the hobby of sleeping with married men.<eos> Married men?
James, you're burned!<eos> It's nothing.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Three cheers for Mary, Queen of Scots!<eos> Hurrah!
It's nothing.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Three cheers for Mary, Queen of Scots!<eos> Hurrah!<eos> Hurrah!
I'm fine.<eos> Three cheers for Mary, Queen of Scots!<eos> Hurrah!<eos> Hurrah!<eos> Hurrah!
Well, it's just a little miracle, isn't it?<eos> Everyone who lives here was away when our victim is murdered.<eos> Huh. Well, where is the newlywed widow?<eos> The door was locked when I came home, and no one has the password<eos> - except our family and our cleaning lady.
I'm not lying! You said killing Tom was to protect Danny, but you never gave a shit about your son till your wife left you!<eos> You don't know what you're talking about Paul, as always.<eos> Hey! ‭He's a failure!<eos> - Shut up.<eos> - A complete failure.
At some point during the three-week race, half the world will tune in.<eos> With 3.5 billion viewers, it is far and away the most-watched sporting event on Earth, but it is also perhaps the most controversial.<eos> WRIGHT: JuJu's opened an impressive lead with his record-setting pace.<eos> JuJu now relieving himself, which is a thing that cyclists actually do, and he's making quite a mess as he continues to burn up the mountainside.<eos> (HEART BEATING) Unbelievable!
Where?<eos> - Office.<eos> - How?<eos> - Bus?<eos> Train?
- Office.<eos> - How?<eos> - Bus?<eos> Train?<eos> - Train.
- Track it down, and find it fast.<eos> It's our only lead to Zahad.<eos> If whoever this leads to is good for this, you put him in the box and call me.<eos> I wanna talk to him.<eos> - Or her?
It's our only lead to Zahad.<eos> If whoever this leads to is good for this, you put him in the box and call me.<eos> I wanna talk to him.<eos> - Or her?<eos> - Probably him.
- Show me.<eos> - If I had middle fingers, you know what they'd be doing right now?<eos> Start with popper 31.<eos> - Now cross your index and ring fingers.<eos> No, under the middle.
- Stop talking.<eos> You get up there and you show these people who you are.<eos> Gary Rodgers.<eos> It's Gary Rodgers. You said that, right?<eos> The second time.
Down the mic. Down the mic.<eos> That's it. That's it.<eos> - That's it. Now you're in it.<eos> - Bobby Brown.<eos> More madness!
I mean it's a win-win. To me.<eos> I know what you mean, Sandy.<eos> I have lots of ideas, but I can't tomorrow.<eos> We've got publicist meetings.<eos> - Publicists? What... what publicists?
I know what you mean, Sandy.<eos> I have lots of ideas, but I can't tomorrow.<eos> We've got publicist meetings.<eos> - Publicists? What... what publicists?<eos> - Oh, yeah, just the top ones.
- How do you know?<eos> 'Cause you told me.<eos> "Life's like this, but I like this."<eos> What am I, Luke Perry?<eos> - Sometimes.
He wanted to get back together.<eos> Can you believe that?<eos> Did he say who this new partner was?<eos> Maybe a-a pilot?<eos> Someone with flying experience?
But we can make a plan for dinner next week, okay?<eos> I'm just gonna go and change these clothes.<eos> Be right back.<eos> Andy. What's going on?<eos> Whoa. Tonight?
This was highly misleading. Okay.<eos> So now they go to the dea?<eos> Interstate drug trafficking is their jurisdiction, not ours.<eos> And we will raid the gardener's property in topanga tonight.<eos> Tonight?
Previously on Power...<eos> You made the right choice paying me instead of Karen.<eos> Milan? Who the fuck is Milan?<eos> Dean.
- This is revenge, man.<eos> Revenge doesn't make fingerprints or DNA.<eos> I got a copy of the arrest warrant.<eos> They're saying they found your DNA on Greg Knox's body.<eos> - Under his fingernails.
Yeah. I am ready.<eos> Look, Tommy, I've been real with you since day one, man.<eos> Okay. In that case, who the hell is Slim?<eos> For real.<eos> Nobody.
- Is that him?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> SOCOs hauled the body out.<eos> - So what can you tell us, Tony?<eos> - Late 20s.
So where did you drop him?<eos> Hedgeley Services.<eos> I stopped off to get some fuel, went in to pay, realised I'd left my wallet in the cab, and the thieving toe-rag had nicked it, ran off across the fields.<eos> Oh. Thanks.<eos> Salmon and cucumber?
Salmon and cucumber?<eos> I got you the healthy option.<eos> Meaning?<eos> What have you got?<eos> Cheese and pickle.
It was 13 years ago... I'll have to look up the file.<eos> One of the neighbours was questioned as a suspect.<eos> He'd had a previous altercation with Eddie Thurston.<eos> A dog walker who was trespassing on his land.<eos> A dog walker?
Yeah? Or what?<eos> Just... Don't.<eos> What happened to you, Hitler?<eos> You used to be...<eos> Hitler.
Massacre this whole city?<eos> We just want to get our brother and leave.<eos> I, for one, hope I never see this filthy city again.<eos> I was with someone.<eos> This guy, Aiden.
Look, I'm really not a part of all this...<eos> Of course you are, especially when you're receiving coded messages from the man that's holding my brother captive.<eos> Now... listen very carefully.<eos> If something has happened to my sister, or if something is about to happen to another member of my family, this city and everyone in it will burn:<eos> you, your boyfriend, your friends, this bar, your home...
I'm gonna have to ask you a few questions if you think you're ready for that.<eos> Ask what you got to ask.<eos> So, did Grace come home last night after work?<eos> She went out to see Vincent.<eos> Vincent.
Just drop the street act, Vince, okay?<eos> You're from Winnetka.<eos> Sit.<eos> Who did she talk to and who did she leave with?<eos> No one.
You hear me?<eos> Ms. Barnes, do you know where your husband might be right now?<eos> Does he disappear often?<eos> Sometimes it's a day.<eos> Sometimes more.
When she was sad, she would come over and we'd watch old movies.<eos> - Why was she sad?<eos> - Her boyfriend, Travis.<eos> Zoey wanted to break up, but she was scared.<eos> Scared?
I really didn't know her that well.<eos> She had good references on her application.<eos> You said you have the apartment next door, right?<eos> You ever see her with anybody?<eos> Sometimes.
It's the King's colour.<eos> Red, then.<eos> A rich crimson.<eos> Fashion will be our standard, darling, and the people will walk behind you.<eos> And me.
I wish to discuss it with His Majesty first.<eos> She is a member of the nobility.<eos> Treat her as you would any other murderer.<eos> Over there, Sire!<eos> Between the trees!
Then the stag fell into the ditch and I fell in with it<eos> The stag escaped and they had to haul me out with a rope and a mule!<eos> I must tell you, Madame, you are a breath of fresh air.<eos> Sire, my friends call me Liselotte.<eos> Liselotte, then.
My kid plays it all the time.<eos> What are we missing here?<eos> Can you bring up that photo?<eos> The one they left with the ransom demand.<eos> Underneath the windbreaker.
There you go.<eos> I'd bring you the phone but it's mounted to the wall.<eos> It's old school.<eos> Is it, uh, Claire you wanted to speak to?<eos> Girlfriend?
Well, don't take it personally.<eos> We're lucky to have a Toronto UC big shot showing us how it's done.<eos> Cardinal worked UC?<eos> I didn't see that in his history.<eos> Uh, deep cover.
Is your husband here?<eos> My husband is dead.<eos> I will slice you wide open.<eos> Just you then, in the house?<eos> Oh, with my granddaughter.
Did you see this?<eos> We've only been live for two weeks, and we just cracked the top 500 in the Hooli app store.<eos> Oh, look at that.<eos> Ranked 499.<eos> Of utilities.
All right.<eos> He had them.<eos> Gallstones. They're a fat person's problem, aren't they?<eos> They are often tied to obesity.<eos> Diabetes as well.
Well, then, same time next week?<eos> You know where to find me.<eos> So, given the patient's age, I was thinking a woven graft with a mechanical valve.<eos> And once we adjust for the inversa, It should be a simple plug and play.<eos> Simple?
You know that.<eos> All he wants is to stay alive long enough to say goodbye to his wife. She's trying to get here.<eos> - Man, I understand...<eos> - Look, in the field, so many times, a wounded soldier will call out for a loved one...<eos> A mother, a wife.
Yeah.<eos> And she'll be able to. Put together words and sentences.<eos> You'll be able to have a conversation. With your daughter again.<eos> A conversation?<eos> With my little girl?
In a few months, you'll begin your residencies, caring for people in need.<eos> If you take one thing away from me today, let it be this.<eos> Treat the patient, not the disease.<eos> Brought you some Vitner's.<eos> - Triple cheese.
I'd have a much better idea where she was hiding him if the Director hadn't insisted I wear a hood before going on assignment.<eos> Just awful.<eos> It's hard to breathe in those things, huh?<eos> It is nice having someone here to talk to again ...<eos> - you, specifically.
Wait. Are you saying they're ...<eos> Obsolete.<eos> Without a doubt.<eos> - So you all are...?<eos> - Technicians.
I don't remember.<eos> Give me a chance to prove myself. I know that I can -- how am i supposed to trust you?<eos> [ Grunts ]<eos> You... Are my...<eos> Superior.
You're the one they take orders from.<eos> Da.<eos> Then I'm placing you under arrest in the name of S.H.I.E.L.D.<eos> Oh.<eos> With what power?
Do you have partner?<eos> Oh!<eos> Eh.<eos> She's not really a partner.<eos> More of a friend...
I need to...<eos> I need to go back...<eos> Please, get yourself some help.<eos> And whatever you do, don't talk about S.H.I.E.L.D.<eos> TAHITI.
Well, I am not your tool. Not anymore.<eos> Found one in the back.<eos> Holden, what's happening?<eos> Who are these people?<eos> Sparkplug.
She's hacked into the framework.<eos> The two are inside with memories intact, trying to dismantle it.<eos> So now their deaths are required -- and easily achievable.<eos> I simply need you to find them.<eos> With pleasure.
Hey, but, listen... Escape is not an option.<eos> Mack has to stay plugged in.<eos> If we wake him up, it'll fry his brain.<eos> So we need to take control of the space.<eos> By force.
I'm not saying we're definitely gonna get locked up, but if we are, wouldn't mind grabbing a bite to eat first.<eos> Though immortality may have eluded me perhaps it's for the best.<eos> After all what is eternity without my beloved Agnes by my side?<eos> This is the way the world ends.<eos> Not with a bang, but a ...
I'm definitely a feminist, but as an actress trying to get inside of the character, you have to recognize that feminism isn't just one thing.<eos> - Right?<eos> - In other words, you're smart.<eos> Oh. You want to know how somebody like me wins an Oscar?<eos> - Brilliance.
Every time I bring a girl home from the club, she ends up in the tabloids.<eos> Not a good look.<eos> So how you take care of your business?<eos> I had an arrangement with someone.<eos> "With someone"?
Wait, the angel from the casino?<eos> I thought he was like... - he couldn't die.<eos> - I guess not. Apparently, a cowboy shot him and he never came back.<eos> So what do we do now?<eos> What? About the indestructible angel-killer?
No?<eos> Well, I-I was learning how to cook and she's my best client.<eos> You're a, a chef?<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> Hydrologist.
Yes.<eos> You were gone a while.<eos> Sometimes we walk home along by the river.<eos> You need to be careful.<eos> By the river?
Fred and I, we tried for so long.<eos> It was hard to keep faith but here you are.<eos> You're right here.<eos> You're my miracle.<eos> My beautiful miracle.
It was hard to keep faith but here you are.<eos> You're right here.<eos> You're my miracle.<eos> My beautiful miracle.<eos> Truly.
That's not good for the baby.<eos> No!<eos> Furthermore, I, Warren Putnam, did knowingly engage in the sin of lust and covetousness.<eos> And by doing so, I rent the sacred covenant that exists between myself<eos> and my country, my brothers, and God Almighty.
Of course.<eos> I need you to... Protect my daughter.<eos> Please.<eos> Protect her from what?<eos> From her.
I tried to make things better for Hannah.<eos> Change the world, even just a little bit.<eos> Just go with them.<eos> Trust me.<eos> Behind the tub.
You told me you were spraying ants in the middle of the night.<eos> - Now I wanna know what you were using.<eos> - Why do you do this, Dan?<eos> I'm just asking my neighbor a friendly question.<eos> Well, Joel?
But William, the look on her face when the verdict came in...<eos> Guilty.<eos> Dr. Ogden, the nature of this crime is such that I have no recourse but to sentence you to be hanged by the neck until you are dead.<eos> Such intense emotion.<eos> William.
Like a bolt of lightning finds the shortest route to ground, you knew exactly what to look for.<eos> And I experienced the unsettling thrill of realizing that you would defeat me.<eos> There are only two ways for you to avoid this nine-foot drop, Mr. Perry.<eos> One is to confess your crime - and to name your accomplice.<eos> - And the other?
I forgive you, William.<eos> I forgive you, William...<eos> give you, William.<eos> I for... give...<eos> William.
give you, William.<eos> I for... give...<eos> William.<eos> Give you, William.<eos> William.
I for... give...<eos> William.<eos> Give you, William.<eos> William.<eos> William.
Well I'm flattered.<eos> Something made you, Mr. Gillies.<eos> I believe you may have some physical abnormality that caused you to become what you are.<eos> - And what am I?<eos> - A monster.
Something made you, Mr. Gillies.<eos> I believe you may have some physical abnormality that caused you to become what you are.<eos> - And what am I?<eos> - A monster.<eos> - A monster?
Veronica, did this man hurt you in any way?<eos> No, he was nice.<eos> He said we were playing hide and seek.<eos> Did he say who you were hiding from?<eos> You.
But for now, we do what Jimmy says.<eos> Shut up.<eos> Yeah, get all that... put it in here.<eos> All right.<eos> Kim?
Kim?<eos> I'll take care of it, all right?<eos> Get him out of here first.<eos> Kim, let's go!<eos> Kim?
I'll take care of it, all right?<eos> Get him out of here first.<eos> Kim, let's go!<eos> Kim?<eos> Kim.
He knew who I was. He knew who I was. He knew who I was.<eos> Jesus, what did you do?<eos> I had no choice.<eos> The body's gone, and everything is under control.<eos> Under control?
- He's a spoiled brat.<eos> And you, Mr. Morse, you know what you are?<eos> I'm the man trying to find your son.<eos> You spoke to the girl, right?<eos> - Girl?
And yet I have no infrastructure.<eos> What the hell are you talking about?<eos> Are you a fan of world history?<eos> You know how Hamas took over Egypt?<eos> With violence.
If we lose that supplier, Spiga's current crop yield takes a hit, we can kiss our second-quarter projections good-bye.<eos> That's above your paygrade and mine.<eos> I meant what I said in there.<eos> Roger was my friend.<eos> An asshole, but... my friend.
I think it's brave.<eos> - I'll take precaution.<eos> - Yeah, you'll need a tracker<eos> - and maybe a bodyguard.<eos> - My God, easy there.
All right.<eos> How about a read?<eos> No.<eos> You miss this?<eos> Lists of madeup problems.
Every love story is a tragedy if you wait long enough.<eos> I should go.<eos> Suit yourself.<eos> We only wanted to make the world better.<eos> Better?
Let's get this over with.<eos> What happened?<eos> Where are we?<eos> You dropped us into the middle of the tundra.<eos> Amazing!
I'll support you.<eos> Okay?<eos> If you think that Ian and this Hollow Sky could be dangerous, I will go with you to the police, stand next to you while you tell them everything.<eos> But that's as far as we go.<eos> Incredible.
I don't...<eos> He's coming.<eos> Smart.<eos> I wasted a whole prayer on you.<eos> One of my good ones.
I'm told you can have quite a good conversation with some of them if what you feel like is talking.<eos> We've got quite a collection.<eos> They prefer it here.<eos> Where's the ladies' room?<eos> Just round the corner.
Let her be an example to you.<eos> To all of you!<eos> Bye!<eos> I want to help.<eos> With what?
It's dangerous, my friend.<eos> You're right, this is incredible.<eos> So you're a spy now?<eos> I guess.<eos> Not a very good one.
Juan Carlo was right.<eos> More than just revenants flooding the Ghost River Triangle now.<eos> - Wait, what's a Juan Carlo?<eos> - And what, pray tell, is that?<eos> - Dead.
Any creeps giving her a hard time?<eos> What about a pimp?<eos> I don't know.<eos> She used to hang out with this fella.<eos> That druggie?
I tried to help her.<eos> Yeah, you're a real saint.<eos> What have you been up to the last 24 hours?<eos> At home.<eos> With Billy and my nan.
It's a disease -- addiction.<eos> Stop!<eos> - What you doing?<eos> - Checking for indented writing.<eos> Not by that ham-fisted method.
Right, you four with me.<eos> Where'd you go for that warrant?<eos> Timbuktu?<eos> Wait here.<eos> With me.
All right, the truth is... there's a supply drop that's coming for me.<eos> It's not in yet, but it's coming.<eos> I knew it!<eos> When? When's the drop?<eos> Uh, tonight.
All for one, and one for Alpha!<eos> Let me hear some noise!<eos> All for one and one for Alpha!<eos> Try not to say anything or make eye contact with anybody.<eos> Especially the Latinas.
Perhaps she's planning a surprise party for you children.<eos> Which reminds me, I know you've had a frightening and mystifying time with that horrible man, what, um, Count...<eos> - What's his name? Um...<eos> - Olaf.<eos> Olaf.
All right, all right. My home is near a large lake.<eos> It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance.<eos> We've already made your acquaintance.<eos> You're Count Olaf.<eos> Count Olaf?
Fine. - Yes.<eos> Just keep your mouth shut.<eos> Have I told you about the first time...<eos> Question, do you think I'm more of a Goofus, - or more of a Gallant?<eos> - Goofus.
Isn't she's supposed to be on a story?<eos> Yeah, missing persons.<eos> Okay, just text me the details.<eos> You know how on Earth they rate everything?<eos> One-star.
- It's very decisive.<eos> I wanna be a superhero.<eos> - Say what?<eos> - Like you.<eos> With a name and an outfit, maybe a cape.
Sir Galahad.<eos> Oh, is this seat taken?<eos> It is now, my friend.<eos> Apologies, you must get this all the time, but I must tell you, I am a really big fan.<eos> A fan.
Or not.<eos> Cognitive Intrusion creates a brain link between two or more subjects.<eos> Captain Hunter considered it barbaric and supremely dangerous.<eos> You two think you can figure this Cognitive Intrusion thing out?<eos> With the professor as my assistant, yeah.
That's not what I...<eos> I don't care about that.<eos> I've dated on the ship.<eos> You have?<eos> Who, Sara?
Man, this thing is heavier than it looks.<eos> Wait a sec. Can you hear something?<eos> I can take her. No, we have to run.<eos> What is she doing?<eos> Amazing.
- Okay.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> One more thing.<eos> You and Mr. Olsen are actually a pretty impressive team.<eos> Reckless, but impressive.
I know what happened to me.<eos> There was a psychic attack.<eos> I was shielding my mind, but I got trapped inside myself.<eos> Shielding from what?<eos> My people.
I'm the one who sealed us in here.<eos> No, you don't understand.<eos> This isn't just any White Martian.<eos> Armek was my mate.<eos> Mate, like your husband?
Told me the truth about what?<eos> When your father and I first got together, it was the happiest time of my life.<eos> But after Lex was born, Lionel started having... an affair.<eos> I was clueless, until I went to surprise him on a business trip, only to find that he was with your mother.<eos> My mother?
I didn't think that I'd ever see you again, my friend.<eos> Don't tell the girls, but I'm happy to see you, too.<eos> And, I am here.<eos> So, put me to work.<eos> With pleasure.
- Yeah. - I don't think so.<eos> So unrealistic.<eos> But the Bene Gesserit are...<eos> Amazing!<eos> Amazing.
We've arrived.<eos> Wow! We're six seasons in and winter still hasn't come!<eos> You know, since you got fired from CatCo, your queue has gone down exponentially.<eos> Yes, well, I am fully embracing my funemployment.<eos> Funemployment.
I thought you were dead.<eos> We are very much alive, my son.<eos> My apologies, Kryptonian, if you were hurt before.<eos> We were only defending ourselves against your attack on our ship.<eos> Attack?
Hero of Earth.<eos> And, Kara, these are my parents.<eos> Queen Rhea and King Lar Gand of Daxam.<eos> Which makes you...<eos> The Prince.
And, Kara, these are my parents.<eos> Queen Rhea and King Lar Gand of Daxam.<eos> Which makes you...<eos> The Prince.<eos> Our Prince.
The chin of a serial backstabber.<eos> Even if I did know something, why would I tell you?<eos> Okay, what's it gonna cost us?<eos> Hamilton tickets.<eos> Orchestra.
I'm going for full romance, here.<eos> And you have ruined it.<eos> Okay, that's very sweet.<eos> But there is no way you're getting in the way of me and bacon!<eos> And biscuits!
You have changed.<eos> - Oh yeah?<eos> - Yes, I'm impressed.<eos> Well, I figured since you were good enough to take me back, that I should be good enough to fill every moment of your life with joy.<eos> And...
He knows.<eos> You can tell he knows.<eos> I'm the most powerful telepath in the Alcorian system.<eos> I know more than you can imagine.<eos> Oh, yeah, except for the difference between a gun and a stapler.
Look, I, um... You kind of went a little overboard with the kid from the liquor store.<eos> Okay.<eos> You're right.<eos> I will temper my ways in our next outing.<eos> Yeah, um, just about that kid...
What's wrong?<eos> You lied to me.<eos> Everything I said last night was the truth.<eos> I'm not talking about us, Jack.<eos> Biomax.
He'll have to live with that for the rest of his life.<eos> And that'll be his hell.<eos> Now, you've done a lot of bad things in your life, but you've done one thing you can be proud of.<eos> You were a father.<eos> A good one.
You got to give me something.<eos> I have to have something to look forward to.<eos> Okay. Something to look forward to.<eos> What do you know about quantum entanglement?<eos> - "Quantum" wh...
Don't chew nothing.<eos> Raymond Donovan?<eos> So... you want to tell me what happened?<eos> It's in the file, right?<eos> In your words.
A family thing that led to you getting arrested.<eos> Yeah, well, the cops should've never been there.<eos> But they were.<eos> And you're here, so...<eos> In your words.
- It was in a bar, so...<eos> - Mm-hmm. You think you have a drinking problem?<eos> No.<eos> Have you ever been through any kind of therapy before? Yeah.<eos> My wife.
I'll get you some Swedish meatballs.<eos> Okay.<eos> Come on.<eos> People like a good cry, Harriet.<eos> Not over a dead kid.
How come we never have sex in the bath anymore?<eos> I don't know.<eos> - Hey, Bridge.<eos> - I met the kid.<eos> What kid?
I kept his in a separate account, made sure it nose-dived the day after graduation 'cause... fuck that guy.<eos> So, your anger at a person in a higher station led you to take punitive action and book a loss.<eos> You gonna fire me for being honest?<eos> What gives you a distinct advantage over all the other capable people here?<eos> Brain power... sheer mental capacity.
You are a complete disaster.<eos> I don't know where to begin.<eos> You okay?<eos> What's the matter?<eos> 15 more.
Thank you.<eos> Well, I thought you came over to apologize, but I'm starting to feel that's not what this is.<eos> No.<eos> No, there's a... there's a situation with the Institute.<eos> With me.
We're in some trouble.<eos> Jeez, man, what's going on?<eos> I've never seen you like this.<eos> There's a detective with LAPD... a woman.<eos> Outside my influence.
Uh, how do you know about Catherine?<eos> How do you even know her name?<eos> Cardinal wouldn't expose his home life to you.<eos> Well, he must have let it slip.<eos> While undercover?
This mission saved your life.<eos> Mr. Cole saved your life.<eos> Please.<eos> I only want you to be his guardian, to protect him.<eos> From who?
What am I to you, anyway?<eos> Or you, to me?<eos> I mean, are you my girlfriend?<eos> And when you win... does that make me, like, First Boyfriend?<eos> First Concubine?
And nothing will scare you.<eos> I know what you are, you know.<eos> The strongest in the world.<eos> Strong enough to keep all of the bad things away.<eos> What bad things?
I know what you are, you know.<eos> The strongest in the world.<eos> Strong enough to keep all of the bad things away.<eos> What bad things?<eos> Just bad guys.
The strongest in the world.<eos> Strong enough to keep all of the bad things away.<eos> What bad things?<eos> Just bad guys.<eos> Monsters.
I saw her draw the same symbol on her window in blood.<eos> Where do I find this witch?<eos> She's not a witch.<eos> She's one of your kind.<eos> A wolf.
You have been dead 1,500 years, surely you can spare an hour.<eos> Every second counts if you want Davina to continue breathing.<eos> What is it that you need, then?<eos> Am I to handle your errands?<eos> Or your laundry?
Marcus tried to step in, but Domingo stepped to his slow ass first.<eos> I mean, shit was about to pop off, but Cristobal took care of it.<eos> Told his nigga to step off.<eos> Cristobal.<eos> Not Julio.
Fuck you.<eos> You've got a job.<eos> What are you guys talking about?<eos> Hey. I hit a midget with another midget. Beckett.<eos> The Irish.
Doctor...<eos> Don't look at me like that.<eos> I'm saying you're a very good con-man.<eos> - I'm a what?<eos> - A trickster.
Don't look at me like that.<eos> I'm saying you're a very good con-man.<eos> - I'm a what?<eos> - A trickster.<eos> A swindler.
I need you with me.<eos> I...<eos> Things to do, Bill. Decisions to make.<eos> What are we doing about Tiny?<eos> - Tiny?
I...<eos> Things to do, Bill. Decisions to make.<eos> What are we doing about Tiny?<eos> - Tiny?<eos> - The creature.
What are we doing about Tiny?<eos> - Tiny?<eos> - The creature.<eos> The loch-less monster.<eos> The not-so-little mermaid.
Oh, really?<eos> About what, exactly?<eos> The secrets of the cosmos, I suppose.<eos> I suggest you think about trigonometry instead.<eos> With your eyes open.
Ha!<eos> I've known you for over a decade, Albert.<eos> You despise British formality, you despise American exceptionalism.<eos> I also despise<eos> German nationalism.
Come in on it for three billion.<eos> It'll be a huge score.<eos> I can't, Bobby.<eos> I deal with Nigeria all the time.<eos> Same with all the primes.
No, if I go to the banks, word will get out, they'll crack my position.<eos> Of course.<eos> You need to go to others like you who are free to operate in the margins.<eos> Big players.<eos> Cash heavy.
Yeah, I'm not sure they'll come and play on my behalf.<eos> I know about your histories.<eos> But if I tell them where the gold is, they'll show up with their shovels.<eos> Want a tie?<eos> No, maybe next time.
In public anyway. I heard.<eos> About that group, down in the beaches.<eos> The swastika club? Yeah. We were just good citizens trying to keep things clean.<eos> And now? Now, I put.<eos> Like-minded people in touch with each other.
- Is that meant to be funny?<eos> - No.<eos> No.<eos> - Well, Jamie Marshall was a serial vlogger.<eos> - A what?
- No.<eos> No.<eos> - Well, Jamie Marshall was a serial vlogger.<eos> - A what?<eos> Vlogger.
Look at me, pet.<eos> What's happened?<eos> It was all lies, wasn't it?<eos> - He told me the truth, about him and...<eos> Jamie.
D'ya ever think... y'know, maybe... Maybe you'd want to be me?<eos> - Nope.<eos> - Not me, exactly. Christ, I barely want that.<eos> I mean, the other part, you know, like, what I am.<eos> What, the... the vampire part?
She say where she was going?<eos> No, she just drove off.<eos> Wipe your feet.<eos> How does fried chicken sound for dinner?<eos> Biscuits and gravy too?
Completely.<eos> No pot.<eos> My friend was beaten so bad, they had to put him in the hospital before they could send him to prison.<eos> They had to make him better, so they could make him worse.<eos> Just like you.
With wicked tongue, the serpent lied and took their liberty.<eos> Through poison words, the world knew sin.<eos> Our hand will set you free.<eos> This city truly is a modern marvel.<eos> Pretty special.
Everything okay?<eos> Uh, yes.<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> I was merely conversing with Miss Jenny<eos> - with regards to, um...
So much information at the very touch of your fingertips.<eos> I never could've imagined such a device.<eos> But you did.<eos> You called it a "world brain,"<eos> a "world Encyclopedia".
Let me take a look at that for you.<eos> It's tender, but everything's structurally in order.<eos> Well, I suppose I just need to stay off the computer, right?<eos> So, are you a doctor or a yoga instructor?<eos> Surgeon, actually.
This is an old dress factory.<eos> There were no, like, dude-equins.<eos> Nice shot, Murph.<eos> Impressive.<eos> Maybe too impressive.
Oh, my, it's the fair ladies.<eos> That's my ex-wife and her friends.<eos> And finally, for those of you who are fans of the undead...<eos> A wine-cellar tour with the Zombie prince himself,<eos> Prince Robert.
So, this is my number.<eos> If you want to hang out, or you need to talk to someone, or... even if the silence closes in on you. And you just want to have another distraction.<eos> It wouldn't be a date.<eos> Definitely not a date.<eos> You?
You'd stolen them and roped some teenage drug addict into selling them.<eos> So precocious!<eos> That was the day I admitted to myself that the sight of you made me sick.<eos> Go. Get out.<eos> Gladly.
Piscatella's not the kind of man who slips on marbles.<eos> On ice. They slip on ice in the movie.<eos> We need to kick him in the back of the neck.<eos> Maybe we can do that paint can thing.<eos> Or the tarantula.
-Oh. You know, when you get everything you ever wanted, and then you're, like, "Is that all there is?"<eos> Let me see what we got for that.<eos> Uh, let me ask you something.<eos> -Is it chronic?<eos> -Sometimes.
Pause.<eos> I know how this shit goes.<eos> The children is already dead, and I'm next because that's how it go for black folk in the movies.<eos> Have you checked the children?<eos> Which children?
Which children?<eos> She said, "Which children?"<eos> I don't know.<eos> Make something up!<eos> Spooky children.
That don't even sit right with me.<eos> Look, instead of me checkin' the children, how about you check your damn self?<eos> No! -Angie, you suck at this!<eos> - No, I wasn't done! - Give it to me!<eos> Peace out.
- I can be Joe, if... if you want.<eos> Joe... are you giving me the silent treatment?<eos> Joe not here.<eos> Went to see giraffe lady.<eos> -Giraffe lady?
I will skin you alive.<eos> Oleander?<eos> Nah. Some old devil's breath Bone sent me back in the '80s.<eos> We shared a love of botany, me and Bone.<eos> And some other things.
- 10:00?<eos> So get your butt down here and take your meds before the COs gives you a shot.<eos> - Listen, what the hell are you doing?<eos> - I'm getting her calmed down.<eos> - With what, exactly?
Something about bowel spasms.<eos> Bet you feel better after you push some brown out.<eos> Jeez!<eos> Fuck!<eos> Wrong end!
Here, I will go first.<eos> My wife, she made sex with our local butcher.<eos> So I made sex with a stewardess.<eos> And then she made sex with a landscape architect, and I made sex with a history teacher, and a jazz singer, and a secretary and a waitress.<eos> No... two waitresses.
-I don't wanna know. I don't need to know.<eos> But whatever pain he's carrying about what happened... it's working for us.<eos> So, this is what I need from you. To go back out there and just make sure he makes it through until morning.<eos> He has a chance to be a fine president.<eos> A great president.
Like what?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Nothing recognizable.<eos> Does he do it often?<eos> Sometimes.
Not the size. Their enthusiasm.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Jerry, I'm gonna have to call you back.<eos> This is 9:00 a.m. turnout in our base precincts or swing?<eos> Base.
You're gonna need--<eos> I did confirm. Twice.<eos> Doug, it's me. Call me as soon as you get this.<eos> You handle just automobile insurance or all kinds?<eos> All kinds.
Project Madisterium.<eos> One simple dose creates instant cellular mutation.<eos> The hair loss begins almost immediately. Within hours, the hair's completely gone, along with their speed and strength, potentially even their extended lifespan.<eos> Are you telling me this creature's become human?<eos> Subhuman.
Does that make you feel better?<eos> It doesn't help me at all.<eos> I'm just letting you know what you're up against.<eos> I know what I'm up against.<eos> Ignorance, fear, hatred.
Wonder if St. Peter will take a bung and let him in, the vicious bastard.<eos> Oh, is that Albert?<eos> I haven't heard from him in a couple of weeks.<eos> - He's a busy boy.<eos> - Busy with what?
Do it yourself.<eos> How do you think we at the FBI do that, Harlee?<eos> Undercover operations, surveillance... and through informants.<eos> You know what I miss?<eos> Jukeboxes.
You show up at a car accident, there's one victim and the driver at fault is belligerent and slurring.<eos> First, you...<eos> Cuff him harder than usual, then send the scumbag to the hospital for a blood test.<eos> Right, which should yield a lab report...<eos> - Every time.
Yeah.<eos> Something you're excited about?<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> Anything you want to share with interested parties?<eos> Maybe a title?
go to choir, tell the teacher you feel really sick.<eos> It's a free pass all day.<eos> Look at you, bad girl.<eos> Who have you been sneaking out to meet?<eos> Grandma Lorena.
It's a free pass all day.<eos> Look at you, bad girl.<eos> Who have you been sneaking out to meet?<eos> Grandma Lorena.<eos> And you.
And we got nothing to show for it except bullet holes and a lot of heat.<eos> This is not happening.<eos> I was gonna open a bar with my friends.<eos> - A family place.<eos> Tufo?
Did you find something?<eos> No, but the medical examiner did.<eos> Something in the autopsy?<eos> There's evidence that Caroline... was with someone in the hours before her death.<eos> "With someone"?
Julia and a thank you card.<eos> Do I have to sign it?<eos> Where's this mob front?<eos> Two houses down.<eos> Blue bird bath.
Interpol's checking for any known affiliations.<eos> We both know who set this up.<eos> He just contracted it out.<eos> - And missed.<eos> - This time.
We don't want any. I only answered 'cause I have a sick kid napping.<eos> Wait, Marta Stahl?<eos> I owe you an apology.<eos> I'm the woman from the video.<eos> The whore?
The whore?<eos> I need your help.<eos> I'm worried that he's gonna kill me.<eos> Your ex-husband follows me.<eos> Sometimes every day.
If she wasn't here, I would've already killed you.<eos> This is disappointing, Robert.<eos> And unfortunately, not entirely surprising.<eos> I'm working an angle.<eos> On whom?
See, that's unbelievable.<eos> The action ain't out there with us, man.<eos> It ain't.<eos> You know, I was wondering, uh...<eos> What?
I'm too busy filling out unemployment forms.<eos> Stop lying, okay?<eos> I know you're with my daughter right now.<eos> I need your help.<eos> With what?
- What's the charge this time?<eos> - Double homicide.<eos> Are you trying to make a career of losing prosecutions based on planted evidence?<eos> Why make it quick, when he can face a lifetime locked up as a cop shooter?<eos> Closure.
'Cause you seem pretty skilled at creating your own reality.<eos> I was doing what had to be done.<eos> You killed a man with your bare hands and covered it up.<eos> It was like a switch flipped, and you became a...<eos> What?
Maxine, I want you questioning everything.<eos> With this time pressure, mistakes can happen.<eos> Okay, so, first question...<eos> What's your relationship with Woods?<eos> Cute.
Know that everything is as illusory and hollow as that girl.<eos> And if you learn to let go of your desire, then you won't have to come back to this.<eos> To Southgate.<eos> No.<eos> To this.
And if you learn to let go of your desire, then you won't have to come back to this.<eos> To Southgate.<eos> No.<eos> To this.<eos> Flesh.
They're a big hit with the boys.<eos> Well, that is your call.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - I mean it's yours, if you want it.<eos> - The club?
Well, listen, my friends and I are getting some fries on the deck if you want to join us later, maybe. Oh.<eos> Naperthrill!<eos> Um, I have a thing to do tonight, so I can't. Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah. Well, next time. Yeah.
- Whoa. Incoming.<eos> - Did you fuck with my shit?<eos> - The hell you talking about?<eos> - The dock.<eos> What dock?
Marty Byrde? That it?<eos> We'll get another shot at him.<eos> I've been thinking about doing something different.<eos> I don't know, like... bait and tackle or some shit.<eos> Higher end.
- Oh, yeah? - Yeah.<eos> Like, tell me about it, right?<eos> Like, pick your poison.<eos> Either you can, uh... you can listen to the blah-blah-blah lectures or engage with one of the homely women.<eos> The what, Bruce?
Fuck!<eos> Okay, you ready?<eos> Time for bed.<eos> Let's go.<eos> - No, just one more?
would we still be together?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Thank you for not taking that FBI deal.<eos> Honestly...<eos> Please.
- What?<eos> Somebody fucked with all the wiring.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> - It's been rigged.<eos> right there.
Hey.<eos> What's that?<eos> You remember that one time<eos> Richard and the Free Traders rewound time?<eos> - Déjà pizza? - Yeah.
What if the fight is all we are?<eos> We torture, kill, betray.<eos> We pretend we're more than that just to make ourselves feel better, but it's a lie.<eos> What about the child...<eos> Adria?
I just can't be here right now.<eos> Okay.<eos> Mrs. Raven's in back.<eos> She said someone shot her husband and then killed himself.<eos> Just now?
I mean, um... if you've not got any plans this evening and... we could...<eos> - What are you doin' here?<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> I got a sit down with Saul.<eos> Saul Gold?
Pardon. This is my first time driving in the UK.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Everything's on the wrong bloody side.<eos> You're a Froggy.<eos> Frenchman.
You earned it.<eos> A truck got heisted last night.<eos> Three banditos, in masks.<eos> Truck got hit the exact same time that our truck went out.<eos> On the exact same route.
Go after them!<eos> They shot the tires out!<eos> They got the pouch!<eos> - What pouch?<eos> - The bloody stones!
They shot the tires out!<eos> They got the pouch!<eos> - What pouch?<eos> - The bloody stones!<eos> - The diamonds?
They got the pouch!<eos> - What pouch?<eos> - The bloody stones!<eos> - The diamonds?<eos> - Yes, the bloody diamonds!
The Harrods Hamper Caper.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Just your speed, Bob.<eos> You know, a little birdy told me you spoke with the armored truck driver.<eos> Truck driver?
Get along then.<eos> Have one for me.<eos> The sleeper, you bastard.<eos> Who are you talking to, Dad?<eos> Nobody, son.
Billy fucking Ayres.<eos> - Tall Paul.<eos> - To what do we owe this honor?<eos> I'm here for a sit-down with Uncle Dean.<eos> A sit-down with Uncle Dean?
Hey, forget about it!<eos> - Cab?<eos> - Already booked.<eos> Be a gentleman, would you?<eos> Milady.
We don't have 48 hours.<eos> Hello, love.<eos> I got a bad feeling about this one, Vic.<eos> About what?<eos> The heist.
Hello, love.<eos> I got a bad feeling about this one, Vic.<eos> About what?<eos> The heist.<eos> The gold.
I got a bad feeling about this one, Vic.<eos> About what?<eos> The heist.<eos> The gold.<eos> - Spain.
But I can introduce you to the Murphy's Law Lads.<eos> Right!<eos> A scrap for our allegiance.<eos> - Yeah! Billy here fights for our cooperation!<eos> - Both?
Give whatever you can give.<eos> Reach in your pocket and...<eos> Are you looking for redemption, mate?<eos> Redemption?<eos> Before lunch?
Putting the moves on who?<eos> Chloe.<eos> I am not putting the moves on Chloe!<eos> So what's the deal with you and Albert then?<eos> Me and Albert?
Don't get too comfy, boys.<eos> This lot attracts bad guys like flies to shit.<eos> Look at you two, Ronnie and Reggie.<eos> Yeah, which one am I?<eos> Ronnie or Reggie?
You mean wage war.<eos> - No, we mean button some messy shit up.<eos> - Help us here.<eos> We want to make this work.<eos> Respectfully.
- Of course I can.<eos> What on earth are you doing inside this boy?<eos> - Friar Joseph, I... - I've been searching for you.<eos> I need your help. With him.<eos> - This crushable little field mouse?
The things that I know now you cannot imagine.<eos> - That's what I want.<eos> Please, can I go with you?<eos> - You?<eos> - With me?
- Did it finally get approved?<eos> - I doubt it.<eos> You know how Rolf's been telling everybody that he's Austrian?<eos> Well, it turns out his grandfather was German.<eos> Very German.
Mopey. Still hasn't showered by the looks of it.<eos> Not to mention the smell of it.<eos> - Ravi can eat a bag of...<eos> I didn't realize you had company.<eos> Company with cocktails.
Except I'd be him. So, I wouldn't.<eos> All right, people, Kevlar up!<eos> This is not a drill!<eos> This is the real deal!<eos> With real bullets!
- It was Donnie.<eos> Raping me... forcing my legs apart, holding me down... fucking me.<eos> - That's enough!<eos> - Night after night.<eos> Under your noses.
I swore an oath to serve the people of this town.<eos> Owen Boyd did.<eos> I am Owen Boyd, goddamn it!<eos> What is Sidney?<eos> A killer, a psychopath.
What is Sidney?<eos> A killer, a psychopath.<eos> I can offer you amnesty.<eos> You stop messing with us, and I'll make sure no one messes with you.<eos> You, your little girl.
You need us.<eos> Well, there are others out there.<eos> It might set us back some... but we'll make do.<eos> What about them?<eos> The next ones.
Your mayor... is a damn liar.<eos> Byron...<eos> And if he gets his way, these monsters that he says just don't exist... well they are going to come down and they are going to destroy each and every one of you.<eos> You don't believe me?<eos> God speed.
Why else are you keeping me here with you? What?<eos> You like playing "Daddy"?<eos> I'm protecting you.<eos> Yeah, from that limp dick Anderson?<eos> From your own juvenile impulses.
Are we ready?<eos> He's fighting the net.<eos> Not sure how much longer I can hold this.<eos> Jesus Christ, Julia, would you please just gut this guy?<eos> With pleasure.
We have come to beseech your uhm... aid. Of course!<eos> You shall have it.<eos> Oh, but then you're going to miss it. - Miss what?<eos> - All the action.<eos> Between you and me,
- I...<eos> - Objection.<eos> This is a deposition.<eos> Objections are waived.<eos> Except to form.
I met the last Mrs. Hammerschmidt drowning in tequila shots at the Bob Dole ballroom.<eos> And here I am... single again.<eos> - You're not in Texas anymore.<eos> - Doug, please.<eos> - Please what?
With the hackers?<eos> You're saying we're like them?<eos> They're agents of chaos who can destabilize all our lives just because they feel like it.<eos> Who are you to those people upstate?<eos> - Chaos.
- True story. - Yeah.<eos> True story.<eos> The strange thing is, it isn't just cars that are built well here.<eos> - It's absolutely everything.<eos> - Except wine.
True story.<eos> The strange thing is, it isn't just cars that are built well here.<eos> - It's absolutely everything.<eos> - Except wine.<eos> Yes, except wine.
Here we go.<eos> Launch control.<eos> Foot on the brake.<eos> Mash the pedal.<eos> Phwoarh!
It's a car that was driven by Bobby Ewing in Dallas.<eos> Mostly, though, I chose it because it would fit more snugly on the Discovery chassis.<eos> This time, the men worked tirelessly for nearly a whole day to marry the two cars and the result was spectacular.<eos> It's a car I have justifiably called...<eos> The Excellent.
That's fine, you can say that, but they're not actually very sensible.<eos> Look, mate, that's not everything.<eos> Anyway, you drive around in your Ferrari, OK, and happily put up with the compromises that that imposes.<eos> So you put up with the cost, the inconvenience, and it's not very comfortable because it's a fast car.<eos> Same with a pickup.
The only things I can think of that can be split by gender<eos> - are bicycles, because of the crossbar.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - And underwear.<eos> - Sometimes, yeah.
He'd represent Maserati's honour on his own.<eos> Ok, this is it.<eos> I am the elected driver.<eos> The chosen one.<eos> The kingpin.
He smashed the lap record ten times.<eos> You don't lose a pedigree like that.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Feel the tail kick out a little bit.<eos> Or the front go.
However, fairly soon, reality began to stick its unwelcome nose into the equation.<eos> You get no heat in here and I can't de-mist at all.<eos> The brakes.<eos> It brakes one wheel very well.<eos> But only one wheel at a time.
- Okay, tell me about it.<eos> - He's just always on my case about everything.<eos> And he started drinking heavily again.<eos> - He didn't hit you again?<eos> - No, not this time.
We make our own hell and our own heaven.<eos> We simply have to decide which one we will step into when our time comes.<eos> - When are we going to perform this exorcism?<eos> - When the time is right.<eos> Possibly tonight.
- Your name, foul creature! - Ah! We are many.<eos> So many.<eos> - You are nothing.<eos> A liar.<eos> A deceiver.
- There are many demons in her all forming one strong union.<eos> We will break it.<eos> - You are so unwise.<eos> I will break you, like i broke your brother's neck when I flung him out the window!<eos> Cocksucker.
That was phase one.<eos> Loosens the skin up a bit.<eos> Are you ready for phase two?<eos> What does any of this have to do with the Hullen?<eos> Who?
Repo's on its way, Niko.<eos> You better move.<eos> We're family.<eos> We're supposed to protect each other.<eos> From you.
John's been sending chem-probes whenever he passes other RAC stations in the J.<eos> So far, all of them are positioned near plasma pools, just like ours was.<eos> We need to enlist other RACs if we wanna take on Aneela.<eos> We need to poison their pools like we did ours...<eos> With what?
Superheroes usually have capes.<eos> Also, basic human rights.<eos> So my turn.<eos> What's your deal with Clara?<eos> A wifey?
Also, basic human rights.<eos> So my turn.<eos> What's your deal with Clara?<eos> A wifey?<eos> Boss?
- So handsy!<eos> What do you mean, Clara was here?<eos> - When?<eos> - Last I heard from her, she was heading here to find you.<eos> Me?
"No basics in, no basics out."<eos> You already broke my first rule. Not letting you break the second.<eos> Then don't break it.<eos> Mod him.<eos> For real this time.
Oh, you misunderstood.<eos> You are not the monster.<eos> I am.<eos> Alvis!<eos> Behind!
Or, put another way, you saw weird shit happening, and you wanted to figure it out,<eos> - which makes you...<eos> - Uh, super cool, always single?<eos> Mm, or, put another way...<eos> A nerd.
Particle displacement shield.<eos> Nice.<eos> So great to meet you guys.<eos> Huge fans.<eos> Huge.
Kind of felt like we broke up.<eos> Look, you wanted space.<eos> I gave you space.<eos> I was talking "actual space" space.<eos> Not between us.
Like I have my old body back...<eos> Only stronger...<eos> - Healthy.<eos> - You're one of us now...<eos> A superior physical construct.
Only stronger...<eos> - Healthy.<eos> - You're one of us now...<eos> A superior physical construct.<eos> With one key difference.
It should be perfectly safe given their level of technology.<eos> You might have a tough time fitting in.<eos> Unfortunately, the upgrade was damaged by the mindhack, but my ability to access the planetary data hub makes me an indispensable source of information for this outing.<eos> - Still, I'm not so sure...<eos> - Indispensable.
I was just fixing a faulty relay switch.<eos> No.<eos> Where were you last night?<eos> I waited for you.<eos> Last night?
I can get into the storage unit, but I'm going to need someone to hack in so I can access the safety deposit box, and from what I understand, she does that sort of thing.<eos> - Right? - Thought you said<eos> Tabor sent you there all the time?<eos> He did.<eos> With a new code every time.
With a new code every time.<eos> Seriously.<eos> Nothing to worry about.<eos> - It'll... - Be a walk in the park?<eos> More of a light jog.
Tabor may not even ever come back.<eos> You could spend the rest of your existence just here, waiting.<eos> That is also irrelevant.<eos> You have the potential to be so much more.<eos> More what?
You're a good man.<eos> No, I'm a man who has his good days.<eos> Hey, if this all works out, after the war's over, I'd like to buy you a...<eos> Fire!<eos> On me! Now!
Rumor has it you're the one in charge here...<eos> Aside from our Ishida captors, that is.<eos> I look after my people as best I can.<eos> And that includes most everyone we came on board with...<eos> Except you two.
What are we doing here?<eos> Talking?<eos> No, on this ship with the crew of the "Raza."<eos> They're the galaxy's most wanted.<eos> Legends.
I already told you, in the alternate universe, the crew of the "Raza" never lost their memories.<eos> I know, but I was kinda thinking the alternate me might be something different.<eos> Like what?<eos> Oh, I don't know.<eos> Concert pianist.
You never had a chance to experience the crescendo, baby.<eos> That's because I was disappointed in your pianissimo.<eos> Okay, I think we've exhausted the musical euphemisms.<eos> Can we go back to threatening each other's lives?<eos> - Gladly.
You mean they'll use it to kill Ice Nation.<eos> All you care about is your own people.<eos> Yeah, like you're any better.<eos> That's all anyone cares about.<eos> Except maybe Clarke.
Look out!<eos> Lock this room down immediately.<eos> They're right behind us. Yes, sir.<eos> Where is everyone?<eos> Out there with them.
I have a team.<eos> Okay.<eos> Today is the preliminary hearing.<eos> That's where the prosecution's gonna lay out their case as to how they think Larry murdered Margaret.<eos> Our job...
She's on her cell if you need her.<eos> No, lit can wait.<eos> What's all this?<eos> There were photographers and journalists all over Paris during the war, and these are from an archive at the national museum. Wow.<eos> Incredible.
Little cream and sugar.<eos> Hope that's how you take it.<eos> Right now I'd take it black, cold, and too weak to defend itself.<eos> I heard your husband was on the chopper.<eos> My daughter, too. Oh.
Is my uncle in some kind of trouble?<eos> That depends on how this goes.<eos> He found your gun.<eos> What gun?<eos> The one under your mattress.
As he should have.<eos> - We are the royal family. - Mm-hm.<eos> But I am so proud of who you have become. And he would be too.<eos> Your relationship with Mum, with Liam...<eos> With Jasper.
What's going on with little homey over here?<eos> Uh, this is attachment therapy for Timur's displacement/rage issues.<eos> Uh, it's going really great so far, yeah.<eos> Glenn, this one is eating my breakfast.<eos> T'Oliver, no!
I don't know what was going on from the waist down, but this... was a mess.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> You thought Jeff was hot, right?<eos> And for my final trick, I will put this straw into my brain... oh, oh.<eos> - Cool! - Awesome!
Oh, Amy, Amy.<eos> What do you make of that?<eos> The woman drinking red wine out of her purse?<eos> Yeah, I think she's an alcoholic.<eos> No-no-no-no, past her.
Oh, my God, my key chain.<eos> I was looking for these.<eos> Jeff gave this to me on Valentine's Day 'cause I'm always losing my keys.<eos> And then we DTR'd... defined the relationship.<eos> Nobody.
Jonah, why would you go down this road?<eos> There are plenty of other women.<eos> Not here, but... you know what I mean.<eos> Hey, uh, can I, uh, can I talk to you for a second?<eos> Me or Timur?
One time my mom got a new boyfriend and they left me at PetSmart.<eos> Okay.<eos> Only Leo knows what I'm going through.<eos> There are four Jeffs in my class.<eos> Okay, dummy.
I have terms...<eos> A dozen laser sessions, at least.<eos> And one of them is, I don't talk about my clients.<eos> What happens in my office is sacrosanct. I don't talk about my sessions with you or anyone.<eos> Not even your husband?
Perhaps a spy hunter is exactly who we need.<eos> With all due respect, colonel, I am a veteran of the field.<eos> I do not seek an administrative post like some invalid or coward.<eos> I hold an administrative post, sir.<eos> With all due respect.
Well, pray then, won't you join us?<eos> That is, if you don't find talk of snakes and spies too distasteful.<eos> Mr. Mulligan comes in two or three times a week to have a drink or to have something printed in the "Gazette."<eos> He is a loyal customer.<eos> Loyal, yes.
Father did. The light would start to hurt him.<eos> - Oh. - Jeremiah...<eos> What did you wanna say about Vernon?<eos> - He's...<eos> - Right here.
If you can't keep him here, how you gonna keep the rest of them?<eos> Well, what would you have me do, hmm?<eos> Give them a reason to stay, fight.<eos> Give them a reason?<eos> Aside from the fences and the militia and the stores and this community, huh?
That karma's overdue but welcomed.<eos> Vernon trimbol's dead, too.<eos> I hope it was a long and... Painful illness.<eos> He died with his family.<eos> His wife, his daughter.
We could lose everything, dad, if we don't meet him halfway.<eos> I'd rather be dead than meet with that son of a bitch.<eos> And what about alicia?<eos> Did you know he left my daughter behind<eos> With those-- those-- Savages?
What's going on?<eos> Someone's coming.<eos> They're not gonna make it.<eos> Bring the truck down and meet them.<eos> Behind the trucks!
I don't give a damn about the feud or what you think about me.<eos> Do you care whether you live?<eos> Oh, I'm happy to die, take you with me.<eos> Unless you tell me what's killing my son.<eos> Anthrax.
Yeah?<eos> It was a mistake.<eos> How is sabine?<eos> Her happiness is.<eos> My first concern.
I'm right here.<eos> You are and you aren't.<eos> I wish you would tell me what happened.<eos> When they had you prisoner.<eos> Please.
I need to change. Obergruppenfuhrer schmidt has organized a pheasant hunt. And I detest side-saddle.<eos> Do you have any riding gear to spare?<eos> You ride? Not for a long time, But I'd love to come along.<eos> Women don't usually go on the hunt.<eos> Except for you.
Uh, let me guess.<eos> By thinking outside the box?<eos> I want us to forget the box ever existed.<eos> Ron, what are you working on?<eos> Literally... the box.
I know, I know, I know that.<eos> - C-Could I take this computer?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Ada, I need you to get down to the station now, with Pete and... computers.<eos> - Which computers?
- C-Could I take this computer?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Ada, I need you to get down to the station now, with Pete and... computers.<eos> - Which computers?<eos> - All the computers.
If you don't wanna be part of it, I'll drive you home.<eos> Door to door, like a perfect gentleman.<eos> What about Ruth?<eos> Who?<eos> Her? Oh.
I've developed a serum that could potentially undo the memory loss that accompanies the second zombie cure.<eos> The serum is completely ineffective.<eos> It won't be long before you have an episode too severe for that inhaler to help.<eos> This is the real deal!<eos> With real bullets!
You gave me some good points.<eos> - Can I get you a drink?<eos> - Beer would be perfect.<eos> So, you hand over money to kidnappers?<eos> Sometimes.
They searched me, emptied my pockets. Took a photograph.<eos> Photograph?<eos> Close-up of my face...<eos> some kind of special camera.<eos> Special how?
You drove all the way to New York?<eos> Where?<eos> Who's he with?<eos> I don't know.<eos> A woman. Older.
Bjorn heard it through the three spinners.<eos> Bjorn?<eos> That is his name.<eos> He is a Dane?<eos> A dead Dane, yes.
Bjorn?<eos> That is his name.<eos> He is a Dane?<eos> A dead Dane, yes.<eos> Therefore, a good Dane.
Even the air is rich here.<eos> Lundene is how far up river?<eos> Half a day, with the tide.<eos> We take it at the earliest.<eos> And Uhtred.
Of ghosts?<eos> It is not a sight you will forget.<eos> My lord wants you to know that by now he will be at Beamfleot and not Frankia.<eos> With Sigefrid?<eos> With his brother and with the fleet.
I will say a prayer.<eos> Hild. Please.<eos> Let us pray that God and all his saints and all his angels in Heaven, smile and bless you.<eos> Let us pray that this union of Dane and Saxon can show that this is a land for all people.<eos> Under one God.
Patient?<eos> Oh, there will still be blood to spill, Brother.<eos> But this way, we can be Kings of it all.<eos> No Guthrun.<eos> No Aethelred.
But this way, we can be Kings of it all.<eos> No Guthrun.<eos> No Aethelred.<eos> No Alfred.<eos> No Uhtred.
Then eat.<eos> For strength.<eos> Out.<eos> You have the palest of skin.<eos> Unblemished.
When do we pay him a visit?<eos> He's got my number.<eos> Oh! And he's very efficient.<eos> Who am I?<eos> Just a helpful friend.
Cut him down.<eos> I know things were difficult between you both...<eos> But Ryder always loved you.<eos> I need to be alone...<eos> With my son.
- Ah.<eos> - Teasing, bit of banter.<eos> That's all.<eos> She confide in you?<eos> Sometimes.
- Jan's in custody.<eos> He can't have gone after Erin.<eos> - The pickers were working together.<eos> - What about the other worker?<eos> - Blazej?
One point of proof does not a QED make.<eos> Besides, really none of our business when he's from.<eos> Okay, okay, okay.<eos> So, demons, witches... monsters exist, and you're a time traveler?<eos> A man out of time.
It is a cul-de-sac, so if we lure the Horseman in, we can use Banneker's disc to block his way out.<eos> But you said that it's enchanted, so how do we open it?<eos> There-There might be some reference in the secret histories.<eos> Very good.<eos> With me.
Our world is at a tipping point.<eos> A war is the last thing it can endure.<eos> And if you lose the vote, a war will surely follow.<eos> It is for that reason and that reason alone I'm willing to throw my full support behind you...<eos> On one condition.
Take it!<eos> Take it!<eos> Why did you hesitate?<eos> You're my... You're my father.<eos> My father.
Signal's clean again.<eos> Must have been a malfunction.<eos> Signal's coming from due west of here. Let's go.<eos> You know who they are, don't you?<eos> - What?
Shit.<eos> What?<eos> The bruises.<eos> Cyan must've tagged him with the five poisons.<eos> The five poisons.
I wanted to carve my name in the world's flesh, like a scar.<eos> And I sense that same need in you.<eos> Yes, Baron.<eos> Not with a whimper...<eos> But a bang.
We'll get there.<eos> aren't we?<eos> Walking away from a battle?<eos> Leaving them empty-handed?<eos> Not empty-handed.
What makes you think your daughter was kidnapped, sir?<eos> W...<eos> That video.<eos> It could be a stupid prank.<eos> Not Michelle...
It means "salvation lies within."<eos> We were taught it referred to the ship that brought her to us.<eos> How do we open it?<eos> Like every other lock, Mr. Green.<eos> With a key.
And, Kimble... thanks for coming by.<eos> Agent Wells, please.<eos> What were you gonna tell the speaker about Peter MacLeish?<eos> Does it have something to do with... with this man that you shot outside Fredericksburg?<eos> Or this guy? We...
A casualty of war?<eos> Are you hearing yourself?<eos> Are you?<eos> The FBI came to see him.<eos> On a routine follow-up.
- Barely.<eos> What's up?<eos> I got a friend that told me a strange story.<eos> - What kind of friend?<eos> - Uh, the kind with security clearance.
Yeah, that would be great if we had them.<eos> Can you pull fingerprints off a photo?<eos> The resolution isn't exactly ready for prime time.<eos> It's okay, just see what you can do.<eos> - Amazing.
I am enjoying being on the other side of the podium for once.<eos> Of course you are.<eos> All I'm saying is that she's a politician and he's not.<eos> Well, opposites attract.<eos> Sometimes.
Signs and... And countersigns...<eos> Very analogue when they want to be.<eos> We're going to have to observe them up close and personal.<eos> No unnecessary risks, Hannah.<eos> Just the necessary ones?
It always looks great.<eos> What is... what?<eos> I got it for the trip.<eos> Wow, I didn't realize you were so excited - for a NATO summit.<eos> - No, not for NATO.
Let's get her in here.<eos> Ask the right questions.<eos> Linus, you handle this.<eos> Find out what she knows.<eos> Gladly.
Come with me.<eos> I would've thought you'd be ready for a change in your team, considering how Goodkin used your mother's memory against you.<eos> Well, it worked, didn't it?<eos> It got me to bounce.<eos> Well, but at what cost? Hmm?
I was just doing my job.<eos> It wasn't personal.<eos> I put Roman into your MRI machine, and I showed him two sets of images.<eos> Some joyful, like laughing children, and others disturbing...<eos> illness, war zones.
This door hasn't been opened since 2015.<eos> We've got the same thing at our door.<eos> Same here.<eos> Something's wrong.<eos> On me.
Hmm.<eos> Zach Riley, 10:00.<eos> Standing at a table with...<eos> Ah, I can't tell from here.<eos> Ahem!
We'll handle the key fob.<eos> We'll get the computer.<eos> Come on, honey.<eos> Hard to believe we ever lived in a place so...<eos> Normal?
She stole my life from me.<eos> She's gonna pay.<eos> You're in pretty low gear today.<eos> I been dating Nikki.<eos> - Freddy's girlfriend?
They didn't always.<eos> - Nice flowers.<eos> - _<eos> Who's Oliver?<eos> Just a friend.
- I talked to some customers.<eos> They say the new guy has a black and grey beard.<eos> Like that guy over there?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Just like that.
- That's right.<eos> - Wanna bum-rush the front door?<eos> That's fine by me.<eos> But what are you gonna do about the trip wire?<eos> - What trip wire?
- It was stupid. - Yeah.<eos> But also sweet.<eos> You ever wish we could just start over?<eos> Go back to where we started, like that first day, you know, just try to do it all fresh?<eos> Yeah, sometimes.
Did you have that Katie Couric nightmare again?<eos> What? No.<eos> Of course not. What are you talking about?<eos> Who'd she leave to play tennis with?<eos> Salman Rushdie.
- You hate Pench.<eos> - I do hate Pench.<eos> Look, just-- it's time for you to go home and say a proper good-bye to your wife. - Yeah.<eos> - Staying here is not gonna keep her from leaving.<eos> - With her ex-boyfriend. - Jack...
I really don't know what to say actually because... I'm pretty mad at him.<eos> For leaving, I guess.<eos> William was a lot of things.<eos> He was a father, an artist,<eos> a cheater at every card game.
Oh, she's... following her dreams.<eos> No one's dreams are in Cleveland.<eos> Well, it's Cleveland, and then Boston, then New York, Trenton, Philly.<eos> She's on tour with her Ben.<eos> Her band.
You know, I watched him, over the years, my father.<eos> You know, whenever that man had a... choice, a choice between doing the right thing and doing the wrong thing... he always broke the wrong way.<eos> Like clockwork.<eos> Wrong, wrong, wrong.<eos> Every single time.
Wait.<eos> Uh, stop.<eos> Would you say that again?<eos> I said I looked in the mirror and I was her.<eos> Who?
Just not drinking this dude's Kool-Aid yet.<eos> - Goss, you got to trust me.<eos> - I do trust you.<eos> - I also want to protect you.<eos> - From what?
Bethanny, who is that guy over there?<eos> Him?<eos> He's married.<eos> And so am I.<eos> To me.
You have no idea what I went through to get these.<eos> So do we have a deal?<eos> Is this everything on Project Utopia?<eos> That's what you asked for, isn't it?<eos> Amazing.
Then it looks like you and I find ourselves on the same side.<eos> So if you've been withholding any evidence, it would be very helpful to the both of us if you turned it over now.<eos> How dare you accuse me of such impropriety.<eos> You told me to picture you in a bath.<eos> A bubble bath.
Bea.<eos> Look, we hit enough of these houses.<eos> You ain't gotta live like animals no more.<eos> But if you give up now, you are exactly what they say you are...<eos> Nothing.
Look, we hit enough of these houses.<eos> You ain't gotta live like animals no more.<eos> But if you give up now, you are exactly what they say you are...<eos> Nothing.<eos> Nobody.
No sign of Bethany, not even a shoutout.<eos> So Bethany's been cut out of the perfect family.<eos> It explains why she attacked that photo.<eos> By and by, little sister was promoted to junior assistant two weeks ago.<eos> Right before the first kill.
As a matter of fact, whenever we got close, he went under.<eos> So why start taunting you now?<eos> That's the million-dollar question.<eos> But it definitely has to do with rapport and mutual respect built up over the years.<eos> Mutual respect?
I owe you all an apology.<eos> 'Cause this was a very thoughtful gift.<eos> And what I should have done was say thank you.<eos> So to make up for it, I'm inviting you all to my home tonight for dinner.<eos> 7:30 sharp.
I'll go.<eos> Sorry, Sam.<eos> Can you guys talk to him?<eos> Can you just try?<eos> Dude.
Uh, yeah.<eos> So, I've just been practicing some landings.<eos> Um, so, if I did like a jump off the ropes type thing, I could sort of land in like a somersault-y, um... type thing.<eos> I could just mark it for you.<eos> And reset. Anyway.
- Aren't we?<eos> Yes, we are.<eos> - Bye. Love you.<eos> We're gonna have a good time, aren't we?<eos> Yeah, with Meemaw and Ron.
Uh, and don't dress like what you say you're not.<eos> Listen up, you little punk.<eos> You need to be in school.<eos> And end up an old spinster librarian like you?<eos> - No, thanks.
Where are you going?<eos> The good-luck present I made you.<eos> What is that?<eos> It's a video.<eos> Of me.
I'm sure this is not how you wanted to spend your morning.<eos> It's fine.<eos> I'll go get doughnuts while you're in there.<eos> Pick me up a pink frosted?<eos> Pink frosted.
Is that the lineup?<eos> Yes. Yes, it is.<eos> Look, here's GLOW.<eos> Right between Dr. Gene Scott and a new animated show called Miyamoto Musashi.<eos> Between a nutjob televangelist and an oriental cartoon.
I was really wasted at the time.<eos> But... the second time I wasn't.<eos> I knew what I was doing.<eos> I was sober and insecure and I think I was acting out of this deep well of resentment I didn't even know I had and it was just... buried.<eos> And then every...
I'm... a Savior.<eos> - Interesting jobs in your world.<eos> - Yeah. I spend a lot more time around swords than dresses.<eos> What exactly does a Savior do?<eos> A lot of things.
We got him.<eos> You did good, Pants.<eos> You know, taking a beer shower sounds great until you actually do it.<eos> I'd be happy to crack open a hydrant and hose you down.<eos> Very happy.
You know, taking a beer shower sounds great until you actually do it.<eos> I'd be happy to crack open a hydrant and hose you down.<eos> Very happy.<eos> Somehow even my underwear is soaked.<eos> Somehow?
Do you understand?<eos> I-I sat in that room.<eos> I met with his doctor.<eos> This "Kissinger" you mentioned... Yes!<eos> Dr. Kissinger.
But let me be absolutely clear.<eos> Since the beginning of time, a privy council has never removed a sitting king on the grounds that the Crown Prince has returned from parts unknown and asked for a do-over.<eos> It simply isn't done.<eos> And without our rules and our traditions, what are we?<eos> America?
Including my daughter.<eos> You might want to think about that.<eos> - It can't be fixed?<eos> - No.<eos> No, not this time.
He'll never know what it's like.<eos> When you're the first-born son, the crown is inevitable.<eos> It's only now that he's gotten a small taste of what you and I have always known... the possibility of life without the crown.<eos> I wonder how he'll behave in this moment of uncertainty.<eos> Not before the world, but behind closed doors.
Can we go back?<eos> Was that your first time?<eos> No.<eos> My first time was... he was one of my mother's boyfriends.<eos> Your...
David is a very, very powerful mutant.<eos> He has to be, otherwise this thing would split him apart.<eos> You're... you're calling this thing "It,"<eos> but what else could it be if not another mutant?<eos> An older mutant.
I'd catch him talking to people who weren't there.<eos> "Who were you talking to?"<eos> And he would say, "King."<eos> The dog.<eos> Your dog.
Wait, so David's friend, the one he did drugs with...<eos> Unhand the reptile.<eos> - Hey, now, don't fight.<eos> Was a man?<eos> Yeah, a big guy.
So you're a lighthouse keeper now.<eos> I'd like to think I was always a lighthouse keeper.<eos> How long did you treat David?<eos> On and off for three years.<eos> Why off?
A man.<eos> Benny.<eos> He had, I'd say, a negative effect on David's treatment.<eos> Was he different at all, David?<eos> Before the break-in? Days or weeks?
It's a trick.<eos> He's not...<eos> Throw them in the vehicle.<eos> I'll take them back myself.<eos> All good in the head now?
back.<eos> But all I can do is...<eos> Watch. this attachment between you.<eos> Oh... but we're really...<eos> -The same person.
Maybe he loved dogs.<eos> Everybody loves dogs.<eos> Not me.<eos> who was he before...<eos> This?
What?<eos> Yeah, I-I got that part, man.<eos> But if you're not the monster, then...<eos> I'm you.<eos> Your rational mind.
It's a...<eos> Yes, of course. It's a mutant. Like me.<eos> And has been with you a long time.<eos> Maybe since you were a...<eos> A baby.
And they must have fought.<eos> Did they fight with their fists?<eos> Uh... no. They fought here.<eos> In the Astral Plane.<eos> With their minds.
And you had this thing inside of you.<eos> And the powers.<eos> David, you have powers.<eos> I know. I'm a mutant.<eos> A mutant.
I was thinking the same thing.<eos> So, when we agreed to this meeting, we assumed... Sidney would be here.<eos> Especially since he assured us that he was onto something.<eos> Sidney's been blowing smoke up your asses.<eos> With all due respect.
You're gonna fix a nice lunch for everybody.<eos> - With no tricks.<eos> - No knockout drugs. - No poison.<eos> - And no secret messages written in...<eos> - Ketchup.
You'll never defeat us.<eos> You can surround us. You can throw us out of windows. You can threaten us and make us cook for you...<eos> Sorry to interrupt, but what's the soup of the day?<eos> I want to emphasize straightaway that the Baudelaire fortune will still be under my supervision until Violet comes of age.<eos> What fortune?
Without Violet, we never would've made it here.<eos> Sunny spotted the lighthouse.<eos> Well, I am so glad to see all of you.<eos> Just let me catch my breath and I'll help you bring in your things.<eos> - What things?
Guardian?<eos> Oh, no. Good God, no.<eos> I couldn't find a single one willing to take you in.<eos> Not after what happened to the last three.<eos> Uh, two.
Oh, no. Good God, no.<eos> I couldn't find a single one willing to take you in.<eos> Not after what happened to the last three.<eos> Uh, two.<eos> No, four.
You know I love it when you speak Spanish.<eos> Let's run away to Europe and find a charming little country to take over.<eos> What about the children?<eos> Shouldn't we live together first?<eos> The Baudelaire children.
I'd like to speak to you all about devotion.<eos> We've been promised a beginning through an end.<eos> For decades, many of us have lived on Titan...<eos> Why are you taking me back here?<eos> - Outside of everything.
Hiya, scientists.<eos> Dear God.<eos> She's back.<eos> What were they?<eos> Protectors.
Just a long con.<eos> What were you made to be?<eos> Agh! Look what they've turned you into.<eos> Weak.<eos> Small.
What is this?<eos> You're Primary.<eos> You can see time, right?<eos> Glimpses, windows.<eos> Back to front... like me.
Pretend the fact that I didn't like you, then grew to respect you but still... didn't like you, never happened.<eos> You told me this crazy story once before that turned out to be true.<eos> You better be able to do it again.<eos> 10 months ago, I went undercover at the CIA recruitment facility known as The Farm.<eos> - Undercover?
You better be able to do it again.<eos> 10 months ago, I went undercover at the CIA recruitment facility known as The Farm.<eos> - Undercover?<eos> - For the FBI.<eos> With your ex-husband.
Them's the rules.<eos> Yes, bruv!<eos> Well done, Harry.<eos> Sometimes all it takes is getting everyone's eyes on you.<eos> Sometime...
I work for Jesse now. This is his operation.<eos> His operation?<eos> This whole smuggling thing was my idea.<eos> This was my idea, and you repay me by sleeping with that old man?<eos> "Old man"?
Tell me you did not go flying.<eos> I went flying.<eos> Someone could have seen you.<eos> I know, but with Aubrey's murder, Manfred's arrival, I was worried.<eos> Worried about what?
So don't make me regret sewing you up.<eos> - I won't. - Hmm.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I don't see him.<eos> You all right?
Not so much.<eos> It's hard, reconciling both sides.<eos> That's why I'm a reverend.<eos> I suppose I'm trying to find meaning in this duality.<eos> - Any luck?
Bit of a mess.<eos> That's what she was...<eos> A hot mess.<eos> Sounds like it could be exhausting.<eos> Sometimes, kinda.
Homicide.<eos> We're investigating the murder of Yvonne Fallon. Yeah.<eos> We heard about that. Terrible.<eos> So she was DJ'ing here?<eos> Yeah. Off and on.
And she told you she slept with Sage Denning?<eos> When I asked her who that woman was who slapped her. Yeah.<eos> So you show up with the money and a bottle of wine.<eos> You were expecting a little something extra for your effort, - weren't you Joel?<eos> - Wine?
Really?<eos> I don't know what I'd do without mine.<eos> Life would be an agony.<eos> An utter... agony.<eos> Agony.
But it was Peter-<eos> - Sometimes your friend is a mole.<eos> You might have to kill someone you know.<eos> I didn't know it was a drill, okay?<eos> Next time...
Ten more minutes, then we kill him.<eos> Take your positions.<eos> How were you going to get us off the train?<eos> You were wanted fugitives.<eos> Political dissidents
Yeah.<eos> You and alfred. Did good work.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> I'm gonna trust your judgment. On how to deal with him.<eos> Alfred?
"Control" may be an overstatement.<eos> What we're seeing here is raw power lashing out, but you can learn to use it, take control.<eos> First we have to find your triggers.<eos> What happened right before this?<eos> Right before the fight with Philly?
What do you mean?<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> You're supposed to be my friend.<eos> David, please.<eos> - No. - David, please.
It's always blue.<eos> Please choose from the following:<eos> soothing tones, white noise, sounds of the forest...<eos> I used to be a junkie, before we met.<eos> Before Clockworks.
Trikru knows? We made a deal with them to share the space.<eos> What about our deal with roan?<eos> Trikru would rather go to war than live with Azgeda.<eos> Mom, roan is my friend.<eos> Our ally.
To stop me, you're gonna have to kill me.<eos> Come on, Bellamy.<eos> It doesn't have to be like this.<eos> Whose crazy idea was it to turn an IVA suit into an EVA suit?<eos> Yours.
She's going in the bunker to live.<eos> Even if this idea doesn't kill you, you will just be normal again.<eos> She was never normal.<eos> Maybe not, but with me in her brain, she's da Vinci,<eos> Einstein, Mozart.
Get down.<eos> I want you to back up the Rover.<eos> Get it out of sight and load the guns.<eos> All of them?<eos> All of them.
You have nothing to worry about.<eos> I'm being questioned in connection to a Justice Department investigation into whether my girlfriend committed espionage.<eos> You didn't know.<eos> So I'm either a traitor or a moron.<eos> A moron. Definitely.
And that's I got was, "You good?"<eos> Like, literally, that's it.<eos> No recognition, nothing.<eos> Like I was... anyone.<eos> No one.
I mean, I don't blame you, but...<eos> I'm sorry, I do not know what to say here.<eos> Are you here for work, too, at the hospital?<eos> You and your friend, uh, April, was it?<eos> The surgeon?
Yeah, I...<eos> It's okay, even the smallest memory can...<eos> It's okay. I'll be right back.<eos> You think you can type with nine fingers?<eos> No, enough.
They love Minnick. And she's about to start phase two of her program.<eos> Phase two?<eos> A resident gets to be the primary surgeon on their own case.<eos> One procedure, pre-op to post-op, start to finish.<eos> Under supervision, right?
It's not common, but it happens, and it's usually an easy fix.<eos> But you can't fix what you can't see.<eos> I mean, you had no reason to suspect bleeding until you did.<eos> And by then, you were racing the clock, and the clock will more often win.<eos> Against all of us.
Okay, well, you know what, stop. Nobody move.<eos> Bolus of diltiazem, fast, and let's pull up an image now.<eos> Did we do something wrong?<eos> Uh, I-I can't see. Enlarge the image and show me the right kidney.<eos> There. Behind the bowel.
Diane became an assistant district attorney.<eos> She made her reputation as someone who fought hard for the truth, and after five years, she was recruited into...<eos> Oh, my God, was I ever that young?<eos> I can't believe you're leaving us, Diane.<eos> Oh, not in spirit.
Fuck!<eos> This makes the operation seem profitable and legitimate even though no actual profit is being made. Meanwhile...<eos> You've been working out.<eos> Yeah.<eos> With someone not me.
Well... that went in a different direction than I thought.<eos> She can't be a name partner.<eos> I didn't offer her that.<eos> Junior partner is fine.<eos> With an equal equity draw.
- Second chair.<eos> - I... well, thank you, sir.<eos> Unfortunately we've run into a snag, Adrian.<eos> - What?<eos> - The class.
- No. No.<eos> I want to.<eos> Mr. Le Frenais.<eos> La Frenais.<eos> La Frenais.
Very talented.<eos> So how far does a smile get you?<eos> The... The bad boy Tom Cruise smiles.<eos> Do the judges go wild for it?<eos> That and a good argument. No.
Do you regret not having children?<eos> Sometimes.<eos> Not often.<eos> When are the sometimes?<eos> With my husband.
You just said something I understand, so start there.<eos> I mean, just take a single human hair, and imagine you had a knife that could cut that hair into 50 thin slices.<eos> What else?<eos> Did you drive here?<eos> No, a cab.
"... Bitch, bitch."<eos> Wow, they all sound angry.<eos> These are the same accounts now harassing us, because you told them to.<eos> You act like I have some secret control over people.<eos> No, not secret.
On that thing that you showed me. Um...<eos> Oh, right.<eos> That thing involving what's his name, um...<eos> - Felix...<eos> - Staples!
Good morning, Your Honor.<eos> Mr. Kresteva's grand jury investigation...<eos> Objection, Your Honor.<eos> Is he the lawyer or the plaintiff?<eos> The plaintiff.
I have not done anything illegal.<eos> That's not my question.<eos> Did you ever meet with Reddick/Bosemen clients with the direct intent of stealing them?<eos> I did what any business would do.<eos> - Which client, Mr. Hart?
- Yes. - Okay.<eos> And your parents spoke with him?<eos> Yes.<eos> Um, my Uncle Jax, he was there and-and spoke to him.<eos> To Hannigan?
Well, this is a surprise.<eos> What brings you here, Captain?<eos> It's about David, actually.<eos> I'm worried that he still sees me as... what I used to be.<eos> A pirate.
It's about David, actually.<eos> I'm worried that he still sees me as... what I used to be.<eos> A pirate.<eos> Well, I mean, technically, I am still a pirate, but, you know... the good kind.<eos> And yet, sometimes...
He ran away, and you're looking for him.<eos> Try the sugar pit.<eos> I'm actually looking for my other boy, James.<eos> Have any of the boys talked of being a prince?<eos> A prince?
One of my patients came in with chest pains.<eos> - He's doing better but... - ...<eos> You should go see him.<eos> We'll have to skip this.<eos> Every. Single. Time...
- Oh, but you, Jenny.<eos> You're different.<eos> You're not like any other woman I've ever known before.<eos> You're a dream.<eos> A poem.
It's just a dead end.<eos> Do you have to call it that?<eos> Look!<eos> Are those Geonosians?<eos> Not Geonosians.
I thought we were...<eos> I thought we were friends.<eos> Friends?<eos> Yes. Friends, that's exactly what we are.<eos> Just friends.
Feelings she had no control over.<eos> Feelings that aren't real.<eos> But she doesn't know that.<eos> Which is why I had to save her from...<eos> From you.
So it's okay to ignore her feelings?<eos> Feelings that aren't real.<eos> But she doesn't know that.<eos> Which is why I had to save her!<eos> From you.
My job is to help you understand your emotions.<eos> I can help you become aware of what it is you're feeling, or trying to avoid feeling.<eos> Right, you've got that look on your face when you're saying something insightful and waiting for me to figure it out.<eos> I think you married her to hide something.<eos> - Or from something.
Either way, I need the sword lit.<eos> So, come on. Emotions.<eos> Chop, chop.<eos> You clearly have a lot of walls up, Lucifer.<eos> Between yourself and your emotions, and now between yourself and me.
Like, I'm sorry that my bake sale cupcakes weren't gluten and dairy free, Debbie.<eos> Joy, where were you two nights ago?<eos> Tuesday?<eos> Um, I was, I was with Mr. Taylor.<eos> Mr. Taylor?
Not the anger.<eos> The pain.<eos> That's what you've been suppressing.<eos> All the pain and heartbreak that you have over what happened with your mother.<eos> And Chloe.
Come now, brother.<eos> I think you've grown to like the place, haven't you?<eos> Come on, be honest.<eos> When we return to Heaven, there must be something that you're gonna miss?<eos> Or someone, maybe?
Right, shall we?<eos> No, we shan't.<eos> Because you spoke to him without permission, I had to apply for a special hearing just to interview him.<eos> That'll take at least a few days, so thank you for that.<eos> Hello, there.
Because you spoke to him without permission, I had to apply for a special hearing just to interview him.<eos> That'll take at least a few days, so thank you for that.<eos> Hello, there.<eos> I'd like a suite for the evening, please.<eos> Preferably one with a view.
So, all this... was for nothing.<eos> Lucifer, that's even worse.<eos> This phone could be the key to taking down the entire Ruiz empire.<eos> Yeah, but how do we crack it if cyber couldn't even do it?<eos> Time.
Yeah.<eos> Or it's just that time of the millennium.<eos> What?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Not this time.
At least, for now.<eos> This is the real way to move forward, Mum.<eos> To create a whole new world, your own world, without Father.<eos> But what about you?<eos> Amenadiel?
This is the real way to move forward, Mum.<eos> To create a whole new world, your own world, without Father.<eos> But what about you?<eos> Amenadiel?<eos> My children?
Nothing.<eos> We've always been around the same close circle of friends.<eos> Our world is very small.<eos> What is she working on now?<eos> The next one.
I mean, what does she get out of it?<eos> Don't ask me.<eos> Why do we have to know what's behind door number 3, even when we're pretty sure it'll be bad for us?<eos> I guess it's better than the way I did grief.<eos> Which time?
- And it's a pretty big operation, Pierce.<eos> Yeah, yeah, exactly.<eos> So send me the chart.<eos> Well, it was nice almost working with you.<eos> - Yeah, next time. - Mm-hmm.
Anyway, so, I wasn't sure if Maggie was okay, but I think she's fine, and if she's fine, then it's okay for me to go to dinner.<eos> If Maggie's fine, you get to eat? - Dinner with Riggs.<eos> - Ohh.<eos> You know, I was holding off because I didn't know if she'd be okay, but I think she's fine, so I think it's fine if I go to dinner.<eos> With Riggs.
- Y-you're not a doctor, - so you can't understand...<eos> - Clear that she has no intention of landing this plane right now because...<eos> We have passengers who are bleeding. They need to be evaluated.<eos> Because we are currently flying between two very dangerous storm systems,<eos> - one above and one below.
It might take me a minute before I'd share a meal with her again, but she's nice.<eos> Yeah, she is nice.<eos> And it's really sad.<eos> I mean, you all saw how happy they were together.<eos> Pre-worm.
You open the door right now!<eos> I can't, okay?<eos> I can't!<eos> Nothing is gonna open those doors except security calling off the lockdown.<eos> Or... or, like, emergency services.
Please talk to me.<eos> It's okay to be scared about what happened.<eos> I'm scared, too.<eos> Scared?<eos> About which thing?
I write about owls, remember?<eos> You know who I was before I met you.<eos> Do I?<eos> I was dating guys in your brother's crowd.<eos> The bad guys.
- Complete classic.<eos> And we were excited about it.<eos> We rushed to the party, put the DVD in, hit play, sat back, chilled.<eos> And in the first seven minutes of the movie, they killed Jada Pinkett Smith and Omar Epps.<eos> Mm-hmm. Before the opening credits, too.
- It's true.<eos> - It's true. We did some research<eos> - with Henry Louis Gates...<eos> - These guys don't believe us.<eos> And Marcus Garvey.
Snapped it, and then he flew away on his horse.<eos> - As he's flying away, we had an epiphany.<eos> - Mm-hmm. We realized how to solve the problem of police brutality.<eos> You just gotta give every black dude a two-to five-minute cameo in a movie with Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum.<eos> - Or Seth Rogen. - Or Seth.
Last night... - WQ2YV...<eos> - I spoke to him. - Your father?<eos> - Dad?
The Deacon has dedicated his life to helping others.<eos> Why would he wanna hurt you?<eos> Because he thinks he's saving us.<eos> Saving you?<eos> From who?
Why would he wanna hurt you?<eos> Because he thinks he's saving us.<eos> Saving you?<eos> From who?<eos> From ourselves.
My name is Detective Raimy Sullivan.<eos> My father was killed in 1996.<eos> Last night...<eos> - I spoke to him.<eos> - Your father?
He's gonna be released in an hour.<eos> Okay, there... there has to be another way.<eos> Even if it's only temporary until you figure something else out.<eos> Frank, I'm scared... about what this could do to you.<eos> To us.
I suggest you attend to it personally.<eos> Fernando is already there.<eos> Who's Fernando?<eos> My point exactly.<eos> - Nobody.
Pirates love 15-year-old girls.<eos> You can help me by obeying your grandmother while I'm away.<eos> You're making a mistake.<eos> I can be of use.<eos> Not this time.
She won't meet with you.<eos> She only meets with major players.<eos> She won't be meeting with Benjamin Jones.<eos> She'll be meeting with a wealthy gold baron.<eos> Gold baron?
Your assistant said we'd find you here.<eos> What is going on down there?<eos> Eric's established contact with one of the hostages inside the bank.<eos> One of the hostages?<eos> A security guard.
Oh, please, no.<eos> Is that a thing?<eos> He's kind of weird about germs.<eos> We came here because we saw a guy<eos> - with the same freaky symptoms.
Alex, we can do that with you here.<eos> No. Moving, it... it helps.<eos> GHOSTLY VOICE: Alex...<eos> If I just follow the voice...<eos> What voice?
Oh, yeah, for sure.<eos> They are true of heart.<eos> They fought bravely today.<eos> What of tomorrow's battles?<eos> Or the next?
Look at you. Joking around.<eos> No PTSD.<eos> What it shows me is you're the same major who went to qumar.<eos> You are, aren't you?<eos> The same major?
Okay, well, whether you do or you don't...<eos> I don't.<eos> All right, well, the point is, I'm your aunt and I want to be the cool aunt.<eos> I want you to come to me with boy problems.<eos> Or girl problems.
Why don't we step outside until we figure this out?<eos> You are not even a real cop.<eos> You've got a cloth badge.<eos> Don't make me detain you.<eos> With what?
She got a name?<eos> "Ice Cream."<eos> What do I feed her?<eos> You know, standard stuff: carrots, hay.<eos> Definitely not chocolate, though.
I-i guess not.<eos> Why do you think that is?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Probably something to do with...<eos> My speed. Mm-hmm.
What kind of mother does that make me?<eos> Agent Thomas, you are an excellent detective and an intrepid soldier, but most of all... you are a superior parent.<eos> I have no doubt when the time comes to tell Molly, you will find the words.<eos> Your misgivings are quite unfounded, for you are governed by one law:<eos> truth.
And I got an answer.<eos> No.<eos> It wasn't a dream.<eos> Who are you?<eos> A messenger.
Wonders never cease.<eos> To absent friends.<eos> To a battle well fought and a victory well won.<eos> Now drink.<eos> Every single time.
Yes?<eos> Can I help you?<eos> Diana home?<eos> Who may I ask is calling?<eos> An old friend.
So you think Malcolm is dead?<eos> What do you know?<eos> I always said I was not gonna get involved with another Marine.<eos> Being a woman in that environment is tough enough.<eos> But with Mitch and me...
And what if he's already...<eos> He's not.<eos> And he will not.<eos> Not before midnight.<eos> Midnight?
She is from the future.<eos> - Molly?<eos> - Yesterday was the last day that I remember seeing you alive. When Dreyfuss fires that gun, it will be a disaster like no other.<eos> ♪ For spacious skies... ♪ JENNY: A long time ago, there was a land called<eos> America.
No doubt Dreyfuss is working on filling that vacancy very soon.<eos> I've located the rune we need to recharge Death's totem.<eos> It was shielded from my senses.<eos> But nothing stays hidden forever.<eos> Not from me.
What, you don't?<eos> The man's angry about everything.<eos> He's furious about how I spend my weekends.<eos> Maybe that's not so much anger as it is fear.<eos> - Fear of what?
- I don't have to be, Mick.<eos> With the spear, it'd be so easy to bring me back.<eos> You're in my head.<eos> You're a... you're an illumination.<eos> - A hallucination.
I knew you weren't volunteers.<eos> Your accent alone was horrendous.<eos> I'll have you know I played Bert in my middle school production of "Mary Poppins," thank you.<eos> Who are you, then?<eos> German?
Your accent alone was horrendous.<eos> I'll have you know I played Bert in my middle school production of "Mary Poppins," thank you.<eos> Who are you, then?<eos> German?<eos> Ottoman?
Seeing the battlefield today, it just made it so real.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> But, if it helps, from what my sister told me, despite all the pain and suffering your granddaughter will endure...<eos> She turns out to be a pretty remarkable person.<eos> A hero.
Come with me.<eos> The spear can help us fix your messed up future and my past.<eos> Never.<eos> If you think we're gonna let you walk out of here<eos> - with the spear...
Sounds like fitting final words to me.<eos> Whatever... science or magic altered reality must have left small scars on my memory that my subconscious picked up on.<eos> So if I'm not a conspiracy theorist no one listens to, then...<eos> Who am I?<eos> Dead.
I know this may sound crazy, but doesn't it seem like there's something wrong with this world?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Rory sold out the boss.<eos> To throw in with you losers.<eos> Losers?
Hand it over.<eos> Like a good boy.<eos> You mean a good dog.<eos> That's all I am to you.<eos> An attack dog.
I'm gonna call my gal.<eos> - We need the office.<eos> - What's wrong?<eos> Yeah, so, Schmidt booked Donovan a photo shoot at Ass Strat, but Donovan just quit modeling so that he could become a cop.<eos> A cop?
I need to work. - I don't want to fight with you.<eos> - Let's not fight.<eos> Let's not get into the details again.<eos> Look, to getting older and wiser.<eos> And hopefully, a little bit better.
Ok, so you remember landing in Houston, but you haven't said how you got across the border.<eos> [Traffic sounds] Reid: I took a bus to Brownsville.<eos> [Beeping] And walked across.<eos> Is that where you met Rosa?<eos> The first time.
- I'm really...<eos> - _ Wow. Tough day.<eos> What are you up to?<eos> ! And it just got worse.<eos> You and Scott.
I can relate to that.<eos> Darling, I wasn't looking for anything when I met you.<eos> This... this just happened.<eos> And is it over?<eos> With the old guy?
- Oh, yeah. Nonstop.<eos> Okay, check this out.<eos> This is something I've been working on.<eos> - Inspired by...<eos> - Jim Carrey.
One client swears a cop killed your other client, he gets a slap on the wrist, and you get a seven-figure civil verdict against the city.<eos> Look at it this way, Arnold.<eos> I am protecting you from a feeble attempt to suborn perjury.<eos> I do this, we both end up in orange pajamas.<eos> Alongside Atwater.
- Have a seat.<eos> His dad used to brag non-stop about that right arm.<eos> I haven't touched a baseball in years.<eos> What, uh... what have you been up to?<eos> Defense work.
Uh, James, we are in the middle of an intake...<eos> It's okay. Wow, Mr. Bell, uh, I didn't expect to meet you.<eos> Been perusing your medical history. I have a couple follow-up questions.<eos> Have you ever had a career working with heavy metals?<eos> - Metals?
As you can see, the cluster of cases are overly represented when compared against the general population.<eos> We think our patient was affected more severely because she's an avid gardener, which increased her exposure to the contaminated soil.<eos> And all this happened on land that used to be mine?<eos> Mm, uh... Yeah, Prescott Technologies.<eos> Between 1974 to '83.
It's just, Jim isn't...<eos> He's a simple man.<eos> He was raised on a farm.<eos> He just wasn't built for everything he's had to go through with his children.<eos> Children?
I don't think Einstein would've devoted his life to autonomous vehicles.<eos> Benny, do I detect a hint of technophobia?<eos> Just work better with paper and pen.<eos> And by pen, I mean my Montblanc.<eos> Technophobe.
Want a fry?<eos> Sorry, I'm Ginny.<eos> I'd shake your hand, but, um... burger fingers.<eos> So, is it Dr. Bull?<eos> Or Jason?
No.<eos> I mean, Carter's got his personal problems, but he and I built this company from nothing, he wouldn't jeopardize it.<eos> Plus, I pulled his security clearance on E.J. a year ago.<eos> How'd he take that?<eos> With bitterness and sarcasm.
On...?<eos> Us.<eos> You and me.<eos> All of it.<eos> For real this time.
It... it's a little term of endearment we have around the house.<eos> Uh, a confident man. He sees me as a confident man, and he looks up to me.<eos> You know, you have to be patient with him,<eos> - 'cause he's a bit of a moron.<eos> - Moron?
A patent for exactly what you were planning to build.<eos> So Peter patented it.<eos> No, I, um...<eos> - I spoke to Brian Fong.<eos> - Who?
So Peter patented it.<eos> No, I, um...<eos> - I spoke to Brian Fong.<eos> - Who?<eos> - Brian Fong. - Oh.
You will not address my lord in that manner!<eos> May I suggest that you take a wander for yet another cup of wine?<eos> Father Beocca, Steapa, come with me.<eos> You will tell me every detail from the moment you left Winchester.<eos> With me!
Lord, you were her father before you were a king.<eos> But your reasons stand - she is Wessex.<eos> She's the blood, the heart and the spirit of Wessex.<eos> She cannot be humiliated.<eos> Dagfinn!
I've something to say!<eos> I have something to say to each of you.<eos> You will be disappointed to know that this woman here... is now mine.<eos> No man is to touch her.<eos> Not with his hands, and most certainly not with his cock!
Man, I missed the signs.<eos> I'm sorry. But I know how it feels.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I need your help, Owen.<eos> With what?
- Exciting, right?<eos> Now all he had to do was pass the LSAT.<eos> And speaking of big career moves,<eos> Rogelio wanted to cross over from telenovelas, so he shot a revealing part in an indie film. Yup.<eos> Really revealing.
I wanted to wait for you. Really?<eos> You're excited?<eos> You're not?<eos> I-I went straight to stress.<eos> With school, and money.
I got my period.<eos> So. No baby.<eos> Gotcha.<eos> Well, maybe it was for the best, with me in school...<eos> Yeah. And my work stuff in the air.
I love you, too.<eos> You got this. Okay.<eos> I am so proud of you.<eos> And friends, it should be noted that Jane would play this moment over and over, until it became a memory.<eos> And therefore, unreliable.
'Oxygen levels critical.' ..everything's so... messed up.<eos> The trivial stuff just... falls away.<eos> You realise life... can be so brief... ..and so, I just want to tell you... ..if we do get through this...<eos> I want to have a baby!<eos> With you!
We better go, come, on.<eos> But keep breathing.<eos> They're here.<eos> Come on!<eos> This way!
They're your replacements.<eos> The end point of capitalism.<eos> A bottom line where human life has no value at all.<eos> We're fighting an algorithm.<eos> A spreadsheet.
What was that?<eos> It's what slaughtered the Ninth.<eos> Can you see it?<eos> They attacked us with a...<eos> A thing. A monster.
Forward, centurion, keep going.<eos> There are lots of entrances the beast could get through.<eos> It's a labyrinth<eos> This is where we hear them.<eos> Right up there, up above us.
You might wanna help yourself and find a weapon for protection.<eos> These are the only weapons I need.<eos> - Now let me treat you.<eos> - It's fine. I'm a doctor.<eos> Apparently, not a very good one.
Congrats.<eos> That's what we do.<eos> Pull off world peace despite zero support from small-minded bureaucrats with no vision.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So tonight?
You'll have your money before close of business.<eos> I already have it.<eos> I made a deal with someone else.<eos> With whom, may I ask?<eos> Baldur magnusson.
Deep breaths.<eos> You're a murderer.<eos> A drug dealer.<eos> A con artist. A thief.<eos> And a midnight toker.
Not after you're accused of being a serial killer.<eos> There's nowhere else I'd rather be than at Fillmore-Graves.<eos> Nowhere.<eos> You planning on telling anyone else?<eos> Any of our superiors?
You told me I could be an astronaut if I studied hard enough.<eos> Me, too!<eos> We don't all want to be astronauts, Liv.<eos> The point is, you could be.<eos> Or firemen.
Me, too!<eos> We don't all want to be astronauts, Liv.<eos> The point is, you could be.<eos> Or firemen.<eos> Or the President.
No, quite the opposite.<eos> I need you to mingle with everybody at this party.<eos> Those are so I can help.<eos> So you'll be my eyes.<eos> As well as your ears.
Couldn't you use magic to dig this hole?<eos> You're right, but what would be the fun in that?<eos> You don't mind a little dirty work, do you?<eos> And there it is... the sound of my victory.<eos> A pair of scissors?
We got it wrong.<eos> Stobert isn't looking to poison us or our food.<eos> He wants to save people.<eos> From what?<eos> Pests, drought, whatever.
Was he a logger?<eos> He worked at a logging camp.<eos> Was he a logger?<eos> He was a guard.<eos> - A guard?
Guy's a dummy. Seegs!<eos> A true right-hand man never makes love on another man's desk.<eos> Or horse.<eos> Or with another man's woman.<eos> Or horse.
Of course, you're important, too.<eos> I hope you know that.<eos> I do.<eos> You been praying?<eos> Sometimes.
It's like a million times worse than that, Dad.<eos> I felt that way before any of this.<eos> Well...<eos> I still think you're...<eos> a beautiful girl.
And my son has a big imagination.<eos> One day he wants to be captain.<eos> The next day a fireman.<eos> Next day police.<eos> A doctor.
So, how are things going at work?<eos> Fine.<eos> Usual.<eos> You get along with your coworkers?<eos> Most of them.
- Yeah.<eos> - Ah, thanks. - Mm. Ah.<eos> Looking at colleges?<eos> Yeah.<eos> With his mom mostly.
Can I talk to you guys for a second?<eos> S-Sure. Everything okay? S-So... you know how I've been doing really well at school recently?<eos> We sure do.<eos> My friends have been, too.<eos> My new friends.
And I want to go there.<eos> It's in-- It's in New Hampshire?<eos> Right, but it's a boarding school, so I would live there during school, and then I'd come home vacations.<eos> And when would this start?<eos> Next fall. W-
- Why?<eos> - Who were you meeting?<eos> Was that your team on me?<eos> Who were you meeting?<eos> No one!
It just is.<eos> We're all machines.<eos> Say hello to the machine sitting next to you.<eos> Because that's what you are.<eos> Machines.
So... do you feel like those names are your real names now?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But I miss my old name, too.<eos> Nyet.
"The hallowed halls of the Federal Bureau of Investigation are abuzz with activity as agents struggle to keep our country safe from threats both foreign and domestic."<eos> Laying it on a-- a little thick if you ask me.<eos> It's amazing there.<eos> It's the FBI. You have, like, the best job in the world.<eos> Sometimes.
I'm from Dyatkovo.<eos> You're from Sevsk.<eos> When the Nazi overran Dyatkovo we were rounded up and taken to the square in the center of town.<eos> My father was shot, along with many other men.<eos> And boys.
They gave me food.<eos> I was obedient.<eos> Helpless.<eos> The first time, they gave me so much to drink, I could barely stand up.<eos> The first time?
Okay, we're looking for Claire Gilliam and Joel Bender.<eos> The killer's parents.<eos> Claire's a flight attendant from Cleveland, big Indians fan.<eos> She has a layover tonight here in Toledo where she has a one night stand with a bartender, Joel.<eos> - Classy.
So, actually leaving her alone with my phone... that would be bad?<eos> You fucking idiot.<eos> I was in the bathroom.<eos> For how long?<eos> A while.
He uses spaces not tabs. I see.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, that's a relief.<eos> But, Richard, what about the next Brett Saxby?<eos> Or the Brett Saxby after that?
Yeah, I did.<eos> So what?<eos> Well, he wasn't my friend.<eos> He was my partner.<eos> My lover.
- That's nice, Raim.<eos> You okay?<eos> CQ, CQ.<eos> We're trying to reach the Space Shuttle "Atlantis."<eos> Or anybody.
Full regalia. I'll be at the church.<eos> Hi!<eos> - Hi. - Let's put - the drinks on the dessert table.<eos> - Right over there?<eos> Oh no, maybe with the side dishes.
Well, I didn't shoot him in the face, did I?<eos> No, you only let Aynsley Norris strangle to death.<eos> I thought she was my monitor, and that turned out to be you!<eos> Hey, I'm not proud of what I did!<eos> Enger!
I'll take care of them.<eos> You take care of him.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> All right, look, come back tomorrow.<eos> Before the fifth at the Fair Grounds, okay?
Change out of your good clothes and put the buggy away.<eos> - Jo.<eos> Where's Vater?<eos> - Pastoral duties.<eos> - What kind of pastoral duties?
You wanna tell Voss that you've lost the entire shipment?<eos> That we offered to save it, you turned us down? You wanna tell him that?<eos> I need to consult. Consult?<eos> !<eos> With who?
That we offered to save it, you turned us down? You wanna tell him that?<eos> I need to consult. Consult?<eos> !<eos> With who?<eos> Oh, God?
Those are not my drugs. I'm not the boss.<eos> You got me going with that for a while, with the whole "I'm a pastor, arrest the bad guys, please."<eos> Nee! No. You don't understand.<eos> I'm a, uh, spiejoon.<eos> - A what?
You got me going with that for a while, with the whole "I'm a pastor, arrest the bad guys, please."<eos> Nee! No. You don't understand.<eos> I'm a, uh, spiejoon.<eos> - A what?<eos> - Spy!
Maybe.<eos> No, I don't know.<eos> So you have no help.<eos> It's just you and me against Eli Voss and his entire mob?<eos> And also your brother Abel.
Every time Voss tries to move a shipment, the DEA is all over him.<eos> Trust me.<eos> He needs a new way to move his product.<eos> We are farmers.<eos> Not scientists.
Why should it be any more strange than seeing me hide bodies or kidnap children or smuggle drug money?<eos> It did not go well?<eos> Does Abel know?<eos> You should call him.<eos> And Bronco.
Christos, where is it now?<eos> At the bottom of the ocean.<eos> Smithereens, with Father and files and lies.<eos> What about the bank account?<eos> The bank account?
Alice, you don't have to do that.<eos> No. I want to. I mean it.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You're setting her up with investors?<eos> Just Seth Hamilton.
Badri, slow down.<eos> There's no time to slow down.<eos> I've must get to Kota... and you don't drink too much.<eos> Vaidehi, you tell us.<eos> 'Claustrophobia.'
Focus on my girl.<eos> I can clearly understand all this drama you're up to.<eos> What did I do?<eos> knew your intention wasn't good... right from the wedding function. If my intentions weren't good, I would've made you my girlfriend... and not proposed to marry you.<eos> Girlfriend?
Look...<eos> Listen.<eos> Yes.<eos> I don't want to get married, okay?<eos> Not with you, or any other boy or girl.
It's a 'yes' from us.<eos> Absolutely 'no'.<eos> Why?<eos> He's a nice guy.<eos> What nice?
What happened, Badri?<eos> Why are you sad?<eos> It's nothing.<eos> Missing your mom?<eos> No... my Sister-in-law.
Thomas March.<eos> How do you do?<eos> Michael says you're an artist.<eos> How very romantic.<eos> Oh, hardly.
So like his pa!<eos> I can't believe he's nearly one already.<eos> I say, not to worry about bridge tonight if Michael's away.<eos> Percy can always take me out somewhere instead.<eos> Oh, tonight?
Well, I'd put them safely away until we get home or you'll get all mucky.<eos> Don't fidget, Bob. "To Flora and Michael, "in the hope the enclosed might one day hang in your drawing room.<eos> "Thomas."<eos> Who did you go with?<eos> A friend.
And yet this couldn't possibly be the clown that was being chased.<eos> No.<eos> Westchester County M.E. says he's been dead about 36 hours.<eos> Obviously, we haven't been dealing with one clown the last two weeks. We've been dealing with two.<eos> Yeah, at least two.
The manager gave me the security video of the fight that Marcus was in.<eos> I still have to review it, but I think you were right to doubt that Roy was there by coincidence.<eos> I'm gonna talk to talk to Chantal after I watch the video.<eos> And while I was out, I managed to meet up with my friend at Stuyvesant Memorial.<eos> The virologist? Yeah.
I've got a very good relationship with the police, so I'd be happy for them to join us.<eos> Okay, fine, you're right.<eos> My company's in line to build a water-filtration plant for the city...<eos> Emphasis on filtration.<eos> Why "emphasis?"
Okay, fine, they're protecting me.<eos> - Protecting you from what?<eos> - My dad is a businessman and sometimes his competition can get a little rough, so he sent me here.<eos> - Like, he's a...<eos> - Legitimate businessman.
- Did you get Reynard yet?<eos> - I'm trying.<eos> - She talks about him all the time.<eos> Says he's a good guy.<eos> Stupid sometimes, but good.
- How did you...<eos> - oh, hopped into your mind when you hopped into hers.<eos> It's a little trick my dad's friends taught me.<eos> - Your dad's friends are perverts?<eos> - Thugs.
- oh, hopped into your mind when you hopped into hers.<eos> It's a little trick my dad's friends taught me.<eos> - Your dad's friends are perverts?<eos> - Thugs.<eos> - Magic mobsters.
You sure this is a good idea?<eos> I mean, you're really doubling up on Fillorian marriage contracts.<eos> Sometimes, you have to sacrifice for diplomacy.<eos> And just wait until we're husband and husband, and what some would call pillow talk, we call...<eos> Espionage?
You're depressing.<eos> It's been three months.<eos> Technically, it's only been a couple of days on Earth, so...<eos> Three months on Fillory of emo Quentin.<eos> Not my favorite Quentin.
Of course.<eos> What are you looking for?<eos> Well, say you have a... a being with an enormous amount of power.<eos> I'm looking for how someone might... you know, defeat them.<eos> How much power?
You're a king.<eos> Of course you will.<eos> I gather a three-person marriage isn't normal on Earth?<eos> Not outside of Utah.<eos> Or some websites.
I probably shouldn't say this out loud, but... this was kind of an okay day.<eos> Are you bragging?<eos> No.<eos> Kind of.<eos> Not about this... entirely.
Well, if my old man makes it to the rest home, the ladies should watch their pearls.<eos> That's all I'm saying.<eos> Fine.<eos> Talk to him.<eos> Bernie.
- Gideon?<eos> What?<eos> What? Hey, hey, any APB hits on Joe?<eos> No, but I am working my local contacts.<eos> Local?
I'd like that.<eos> - This one is the...<eos> - 2017.<eos> Naturally aspirated.<eos> All-wheel drive.
She was, like, really mad.<eos> And then she was only kind of mad, and now she's, like, just normal mad.<eos> But she says that's just part of dating' me.<eos> Also a part of being your mother.<eos> - And your brother.
And then she was only kind of mad, and now she's, like, just normal mad.<eos> But she says that's just part of dating' me.<eos> Also a part of being your mother.<eos> - And your brother.<eos> - And your father.
Screw it.<eos> I just better make sure my fire insurance is up to date.<eos> Good for you, Maggie.<eos> Yeah, I'd rather not sell than turn it into a fancy rest stop for guys with man buns.<eos> Man buns?
What are you talking about?<eos> It's 5:30. You're gonna be in bed in 90 minutes.<eos> I'm going out to dinner.<eos> - Oh, really?<eos> With who? - A friend.
I've never seen him before.<eos> Is he new?<eos> Compared to my last boyfriend, he's new and improved.<eos> That's you, Colt.<eos> Old and worse.
Oh, hey, guess who I ran into at the bar?<eos> Heather.<eos> She's on a date with some dude named Paul.<eos> Oh, my God. Paul?<eos> Really?
So, then what's the big deal?<eos> The big deal is Heather's having my baby.<eos> And anyone she hangs out with is potentially gonna be hanging out with my kid.<eos> I don't want my kid bein' a wrestler.<eos> Or good at math.
I need to take the Bronco over to Mary's house.<eos> I don't know, but he said he'd be home soon.<eos> You want a cookie?<eos> They got pot in 'em?<eos> Walnuts.
Yeah, sure. It's your whiskey.<eos> We gotta stop this.<eos> - Drinkin'?<eos> - God, no.<eos> This.
That's not what Dad said.<eos> That's not what you said, is it?<eos> What's going on?<eos> You know, you smell like a bar.<eos> But not... not your bar.
It's a troll site.<eos> Okay?<eos> People just blowing off steam.<eos> Trust me, I got no desire to meet 'em in person.<eos> Especially not that guy.
Great.<eos> Professor Malkova.<eos> I wondered when I might be seeing you.<eos> Fancy a game?<eos> With you?
Holy Bananas Foster, it's Batman!<eos> Did I see a Batarang fly in here?<eos> You mean this one? - Oh-ho!<eos> - Are you a Batman fan too?<eos> A fan?
- We should go. - Okay.<eos> Umm, you dropped your skullcap.<eos> We're just friends.<eos> Emily's dating a henchman, right?<eos> - Yeah, big time.
That's so sweet!<eos> I bet he stole it from somewhere really nice.<eos> - What?<eos> - You're dating a henchman.<eos> A henchman?
_<eos> _<eos> Is Jane okay? Yeah.<eos> Just nervous.<eos> Ah, yes. The big preschool evaluation.
Ah, yes. Work.<eos> Remember Jane's dream job' with the dream boss?<eos> Well, over the past few years, that dream boss became...<eos> The Alvarado manuscript?<eos> a nightmare.
Well, over the past few years, that dream boss became...<eos> The Alvarado manuscript?<eos> a nightmare.<eos> Yep. Here you go.<eos> With the edits.
Beyond Sigefrid is Kjartan, beyond Kjartan is Aelfric.<eos> And what you must do, Lord, is win the first and this could be done this very night.<eos> I have decided that we shall negotiate.<eos> We bargain?<eos> With an army so small?
Believe me, i knew nothing of this... Arrangement you had with my wife.<eos> Mmm. But I'm glad that you have forgiven her.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> They say you are called Egil!<eos> Egil the bastard.
I need better drugs, then.<eos> Docs say you got a concussion, couple bumps and bruises, but all in all, you got off pretty easy. Doesn't feel like it.<eos> Well, you could've used the ladder.<eos> You know, just saved us all a bunch of stress.<eos> Next time.
My dear!<eos> Welcome to Paradise!<eos> Go Go go!<eos> Yet again, we have set the benchmark for social intercourse.<eos> And with such aplomb!
I'm creating a map of space.<eos> Sounds impressive.<eos> How's it going?<eos> Anything worth doing takes time.<eos> - Oh, so, in other words... - Yeah.
My name is Liam Cole.<eos> I'm a student at MIT.<eos> My I.D. is in my wallet. It's...<eos> MIT grad.<eos> Astrophysics.
Can I ask you something?<eos> Mm-hmm. If you were writing a story about a... a guy who knew the world was coming to an end, and he could either save a couple thousand people or live the rest of his days with a beautiful woman, what would you have him do?<eos> It depends.<eos> Is the character supposed to be a hero or a loser?<eos> Uh... a hero.
We've been meeting twice a month for over two years.<eos> Of course. I'd be happy to make a small donation.<eos> Oh, no. Thank you kindly, but we're not a charity.<eos> - We're an organization.<eos> - An informal organization.
Of course. I'd be happy to make a small donation.<eos> Oh, no. Thank you kindly, but we're not a charity.<eos> - We're an organization.<eos> - An informal organization.<eos> But an organization nonetheless.
For now.<eos> And who is this?<eos> I didn't know him either.<eos> Turns out his father is an Earl.<eos> An Earl?
To whom are you married, my beauty?<eos> Him?<eos> Is he a king? No.<eos> He's...<eos> An Earl in Denmark.
Him?<eos> Is he a king? No.<eos> He's...<eos> An Earl in Denmark.<eos> An Earl?
Puppy is off his leash!<eos> Who knows what havoc he may create?<eos> I don't know you.<eos> Are you a soldier?<eos> A diplomat?
Who knows what havoc he may create?<eos> I don't know you.<eos> Are you a soldier?<eos> A diplomat?<eos> Just a humble wordsmith.
The people do not know what they want.<eos> They are well-meaning but they are ignorant.<eos> I protect them. I give them a country and a history to be proud of.<eos> You are a tyrant.<eos> An enlightened tyrant.
You like the attention.<eos> Besides it looks okay on you.<eos> Wow.<eos> You didn't kill me.<eos> This time.
Jaxson labeled every text, "About Sam."<eos> How could she not look?<eos> The last time we spoke, she said she actually spotted him watching her.<eos> - When was that?<eos> - Before that stupid trial.
The last time we spoke, she said she actually spotted him watching her.<eos> - When was that?<eos> - Before that stupid trial.<eos> - She was over by the river.<eos> - The river?
Letters? Don't want 'em.<eos> I'm keeping all this correspondence from the tzar for posterity.<eos> They shouldn't have been packed.<eos> What a piece of work you are.<eos> The tzar?
Well, what was it?<eos> Just a bit of a cold.<eos> We can't go in her room.<eos> What... she went to bed with it?<eos> Yeah. A bit of a cold?
Yes.<eos> In the name of the father and of The son and of the holy spirit.<eos> Amen.<eos> The grace of our lord Jesus Christ and the love of god. And the communion of the Holy spirit be with you all.<eos> And with your spirit.
Well, you don't have to worry about that, I wouldn't be on my own. Would I, joe?<eos> Well, I'll back you up, mate...<eos> But there's only so far I can go. You know that.<eos> Have you seen him this week?<eos> Who?
I can tell you, it's the Penance, it's the penance, It's the penalty they've got to pay.<eos> You see, confess to us and It's five years inside, But confess to you... And it's, what?<eos> Three hail marys and an our father?<eos> See, ours is the real world, We deal with real people,<eos> Proper problems.
Hey, Bill.<eos> So, my office just got in touch with the other volunteers Ms. Rozen was here with.<eos> And according to them, she never mentioned having a gun or made any indication that she might need one.<eos> The only thing I could think of is that she had it for protection.<eos> Protection from what?
He knew.<eos> Hodor knew his whole life That his destiny was to save his little friend.<eos> Just like you have saved from embarrassment at Comic-Con,<eos> So thank you, manny.<eos> My pleasure.
Maybe I don't want to win this bet.<eos> Okay, we need to figure out whether this crash was an accident or part of a deliberate escape plan.<eos> Gina, I need you manning the tip line. Ha-ha!<eos> Good luck talking to the crazies.<eos> Crazies?
No, you did not!<eos> Thermal imaging, baby.<eos> Thermal imaging baby?<eos> Very handy in fugitive hunting.<eos> Also...
Any break we can catch right now will help.<eos> I heard what happened earlier.<eos> That was a risky move you made, standing in front of the truck like that.<eos> I had to stop it before it hurt anyone else, to get it back under control.<eos> The off-the-books program? Or something else?
His name is Carl Anderson and he may be armed.<eos> Can you give me a description?<eos> The man is tall, in his 30s and wears a dark lens in his glasses.<eos> - He's travelling with a woman.<eos> - His wife?
Can you give me a description?<eos> The man is tall, in his 30s and wears a dark lens in his glasses.<eos> - He's travelling with a woman.<eos> - His wife?<eos> - His sister.
Do you think I won't find out who you are?<eos> Or I won't contact your family and tell them what you've done, that you keep your sister prisoner, you've committed murder?<eos> Why do you lock up your sister?<eos> To protect her.<eos> From what?
Why do you lock up your sister?<eos> To protect her.<eos> From what?<eos> From it all.<eos> From temptation, humanity.
Couldn't bear the shame.<eos> She said they'd get the diamonds and she could be rid of him.<eos> Who killed Isaac Goldberg?<eos> The man she promised to shack up with.<eos> 'Grandjean.'
Scoring touchdowns, making people laugh, punishing my body, enduring the pain.<eos> All in the name of entertainment.<eos> Don't you understand?<eos> I'm a commodity, a product.<eos> A modern day gladiator.
When I spoke to the reporter, I was speaking in the abstract.<eos> - No, I never thought...<eos> - We have more cases of Aleutian flu here every day.<eos> We could be looking at a truly horrific public health crisis.<eos> A real one.
So, she owns this knitting store, and, it's got some illconceived pun for a name, like Knitpicker, or...<eos> Ittie Bittie Knittie Committee?<eos> Yes!<eos> And her secret sex fantasy is being tied up.<eos> With yarn, of course.
Circle inside of a circle.<eos> That could be the rings around Geonosis.<eos> I need more than some scratches in the dirt.<eos> Chopper picked up an energy reading in the direction Klik-Klak was going.<eos> - Down below somewhere.
No. The Force resides in all living things. But you have to be open to it.<eos> Sabine is blocked. Her mind is conflicted.<eos> She's so expressive and yet so tightly wound.<eos> - She's so...<eos> - Mandalorian.
Teaching Ezra wasn't easy, but you did it well.<eos> I'm sure you'll find a way to get through to Sabine.<eos> It's not the same.<eos> Ezra was eager to learn.<eos> Sometimes too eager.
NSA and MI6 are doing the same.<eos> Here are the translations.<eos> I had hard copies made, just in case anyone hates scrolling on the computer.<eos> These are all phone calls?<eos> Between the same two callers, both unidentified.
Looking for a signal... got it!<eos> Tell them that we need all units.<eos> Okay, it's not that simple.<eos> I have to connect to Pete's computer with a service request. And then, once we get a connection, then I can send a message.<eos> _
- and especially not Ada.<eos> - Okay!<eos> Okay, yes, yes, yes, but... reality check here.<eos> We are going up against a hacker.<eos> Not just any hacker.
- Neo?<eos> - That's not what you're thinking.<eos> What are you thinking?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> Nobodies.
Who's Dr. Kimbo?<eos> You, you want to tell us something, Max?<eos> Well, it appears that Dr. Kimbo was under the mistaken impression that you were in charge of all the hiring decisions.<eos> Quite unfortunate, because he was actually a really strong candidate.<eos> Strong candidate?
Okay, the only thing I want to hear out of you right now is your alibi for last night, assuming you have one.<eos> You got one of those?<eos> I do.<eos> After work, I went for sushi.<eos> Nobu, of course.
That about the gist of it, Bob?<eos> Look, there's got to be a way we can figure out how to keep all this in this office.<eos> I'm listening.<eos> What if I give you all my commission next month?<eos> Quarter.
I can't understand you.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> I said, the dead car buyer had traces of gamma radiation in his system.<eos> The only way that would be possible is if he was exposed to some sort of volatile radioactive materials.<eos> Possibly uranium.
You're sittin' at the poker table, and you can't see who the idiot is, it's you.<eos> I saved your life by throwing' you in that box.<eos> You should be thankful.<eos> - Yeah, uh, just what did ya hit me with, anyway?<eos> - Big ol' bottle.
- Name sounds familiar.<eos> - Well, hickok was acquainted to a relative of mine, uh, a miss Mattie silks.<eos> She was engaged to some fancy fella, if I remember.<eos> - Mr. poe's also engaged, but the lady's name is lyles, Mattie lyles.<eos> - Lyles?
I was just doing what I always do.<eos> Which always works, by the way.<eos> I did not sleep with him.<eos> But I am a whore.<eos> A thirsty whore.
- The next 24 hours will be critical, so we're admitting her in the hospital for further observation.<eos> The nurse'll let you know when you can see her.<eos> You ever bring that garbage in my house again, we are done.<eos> Hi, you.<eos> - Man.
Hey, you know what?<eos> On this take, let's try it with just Mary.<eos> What do you mean,<eos> - try it with just Mary?<eos> - Just this take.
Star.<eos> I want her out.<eos> Look, she is a loose cannon,<eos> - I know that, but she is...<eos> - Trash.
What you praying for?<eos> Danielle.<eos> And the eternal hell for her kids?<eos> The kids are gonna be just fine.<eos> How?
Yeah, her date picked her up.<eos> Oh, wait, that's Alex.<eos> You want a drink?<eos> - Whiskey.<eos> - With what?
Really?<eos> How am I the teenager and I'm dealing with your mama?<eos> I'm just tired of listening to you two arguing all the time.<eos> So grow a pair.<eos> - With you or her?
How am I the teenager and I'm dealing with your mama?<eos> I'm just tired of listening to you two arguing all the time.<eos> So grow a pair.<eos> - With you or her?<eos> - Both.
- Y'all got to help me open.<eos> - Why would we do that?<eos> 'Cause Carlotta's downtown talking to the po-pos.<eos> - About what?<eos> - Jahil.
Yeah, slightly didn't work out.<eos> Second attempt on the way.<eos> Did I hear voices?<eos> I thought you were going out with Harry tonight?<eos> Howard.
He's a paper tiger.<eos> Not fit to command!<eos> Look, it doesn't matter who's in charge of your stupid expedition!<eos> You don't stand a chance against the Ice Warriors!<eos> - What, all two of 'em?
To the end.<eos> To the death, my friend, to the death.<eos> - You knew that would happen.<eos> - Always been my problem.<eos> What?
What's the difference?<eos> I call one good, one bad.<eos> Er, I'll take the good one.<eos> Excellent, positive attitude. Will help with the horror to come.<eos> What horror?
Vending machine.<eos> Drink it while it is very hot... the pain will disguise the taste.<eos> Thanks.<eos> How long have I been here?<eos> Oh, weeks.
What's difficult?<eos> Where is the Doctor?<eos> I need to...<eos> His injuries are being tended to.<eos> Injuries?
But you, Alit, you are going to put it all back.<eos> I've never met anyone like you. So where are you from?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I was sort of found.<eos> On a doorstep?
If there's any place he'd do that.<eos> How can you fly the TARDIS?<eos> I'm the pilot.<eos> I can fly anything!<eos> Even you!
Yes. Also true.<eos> - For what?<eos> - Hallucinations of his dead wife.<eos> You can see how this might not be my first choice for how to spend a day off.<eos> Well, not with that attitude.
And, yet, here I am.<eos> How the hell are you still alive?<eos> Well, I'm eating a human brain.<eos> So, that makes me a...<eos> - Cannibal?
So, that makes me a...<eos> - Cannibal?<eos> - Technically, I suppose, but that's not the answer I'm looking for.<eos> I'm eating a human brain, I'm indestructible, therefore, I am a...<eos> - A serial killer?
Hey, Uncle Donald.<eos> Nope, yeah, pretty boring.<eos> We napped, rubbed ointment on our joints, old people stuff.<eos> Oh, what about the dragon?<eos> And the plane crash? And...
Some rest, some food.<eos> And hey, there's an entire kingdom's-worth of problems to distract you.<eos> We really are beset, and could use your help.<eos> - I hear you, I'm just...<eos> - Good, vamanos.
Here.<eos> Okay.<eos> No way is this sigil 40 years old.<eos> I mean, hardly anything stays hot that long.<eos> Yeah, except blood.
Okay.<eos> No way is this sigil 40 years old.<eos> I mean, hardly anything stays hot that long.<eos> Yeah, except blood.<eos> Human blood.
- Loria.<eos> Some canyon with these purple-ish rock things.<eos> - Rock things?<eos> What...<eos> - Dicks, okay?
He doesn't even know who I am.<eos> I made sure of it.<eos> It's for the best.<eos> He's a good man, Julia.<eos> An influential man.
Oh, this box.<eos> Well, Alan asked me to make a surprise dinner for Elliot, and, me, I am looking forward to spending a booze-filled night with you and Yolanda, my gal-entines.<eos> Where the hell have you guys been?<eos> We were supposed to start drinking at 9:00.<eos> P.M.
Oh... Elliot and I had a horrible fight. I didn't know where else to go.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry, Alan.<eos> Thanks, but there's nothing you could possibly say to cheer me up right now.<eos> - We got a male stripper coming.<eos> - Except that.
I led you here... just as I led your friend to my key.<eos> This whole thing... it was a test, wasn't it?<eos> From the moment you arrived, you were supposed to be different, Gideon.<eos> You were a gift... my loyal son.<eos> Gift?
What's going on?<eos> Sir, we need you in the vehicle now.<eos> Bomb!<eos> Second car!<eos> Good morning.
Firas Barmuk is the guy who paid them to chop up the two cars in the shooting that killed Newton.<eos> Uh, yeah, Barmuk was born here, but he has ties to a Syrian money-laundering group that's been making a big push into L.A. lately.<eos> Why would a money-laundering group want to kill Newton? What's the link?<eos> Oh, well, there's not a link, per Se, more like a...<eos> like a threat. Like a thin threat. Kind of like a spider web kind of thing that...
- to go back to the hotel yet.<eos> - That's fine.<eos> But we at least have to let everyone know that you're okay.<eos> I-I just can't face any of them right now.<eos> Especially Juan-Luis.
- That's fine.<eos> But we at least have to let everyone know that you're okay.<eos> I-I just can't face any of them right now.<eos> Especially Juan-Luis.<eos> And my father...
You look... really beautiful with your hair like that.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Ah, sorry, I didn't mean to wake you.<eos> No, I-I was waiting up for you.<eos> With the pillow over your head and the light off?
Are you ready to be baptized and reborn?<eos> I am.<eos> "I indeed baptize you with water "unto repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier "than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear:<eos> "he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost,<eos> - and with fire."
Linden knows that's how I make the lowest bid.<eos> So he renegotiated after the fact?<eos> Offered me $90,000 on a $2 million job.<eos> I decided, "Screw it, I'm gonna fight back for once."<eos> - With a 9-mil?
Danny never made it out.<eos> Linden owned the building.<eos> And he skated.<eos> He always skates.<eos> Not this time.
Sarah Wheeler, Linden's daughter.<eos> The grieving widow.<eos> - You sure it was her?<eos> - Yeah, he recognized her photo.<eos> - With Linden?
You're running away from Smurf?<eos> No.<eos> You want to move in with me?<eos> I do.<eos> And with Carlos?
Call the local cops.<eos> Get everyone there now!<eos> Charlie!<eos> - Yeah!<eos> - Behind you!
And they're zombies, so that doesn't do me much good.<eos> I may never be loved or have sex again unless I move to some backwards civilization that doesn't consume news.<eos> Like Pullman.<eos> Oh! Sick Wazzu burn.<eos> Wazzu?
You're the only person who can help us.<eos> Okay, here's what we're up against with finding a safe haven for the horse.<eos> It has to be a country whose customs laws are lax enough to accept a horse who has been exposed to the diseases of two different countries.<eos> It would have to have regular trade relations<eos> - with the U.S.
I don't want to do this right now.<eos> Don't want to do what?<eos> What do you think's gonna happen to the bloc?<eos> Nothing good.<eos> And us?
I remember, but that was before I got a chance to chat with the delightful Madeline Kenner.<eos> She had all sorts of things to say about you.<eos> Hell truly hath no fury...<eos> Alan, she signed a full confession.<eos> Under duress.
They had a problem with me.<eos> Omar may not have had enemies, but his dad did.<eos> Nasir Mohammed.<eos> He's a hawaladar.<eos> A what?
Drop the case.<eos> Why would I do that?<eos> Because Omar was caught red-handed with liquid sarin.<eos> And we corroborated both his ties to Al-Qaeda and his plan to attack the train station.<eos> - With whom?
Why would I do that?<eos> Because Omar was caught red-handed with liquid sarin.<eos> And we corroborated both his ties to Al-Qaeda and his plan to attack the train station.<eos> - With whom?<eos> - A confidential informant.
Just because it's legal doesn't make it any less inhumane.<eos> - Watch yourself, Ms. Morrison.<eos> - I will do that, ma'am.<eos> Who is watching all of you?<eos> Respectfully,
They weren't there during the autopsy.<eos> Was Gerald's life shattered the day Claire died?<eos> No doubt.<eos> Was he incredibly devoted to her?<eos> No doubt.
Does it mean anything to you?<eos> No. I'm afraid not.<eos> Didn't mean anything to us, either.<eos> Which is why I was considering reaching out to my brother.<eos> To Rhys?
Because, currently, your baby mama has us tracking down a man who liquefies corpses because a Kensington assassin is back from the dead, and it's not even noon.<eos> If you'll recall, I also asked you not to work for Margot.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Is this an apology call or a call about how right you always are about everything?<eos> Apology call.
Right. Sorry.<eos> Tell us how you did it.<eos> Well, about a month ago, I-I got a manila envelope on my desk with $10,000 in it.<eos> Like crisp, brand-new bills with all the instructions.<eos> What kind of instructions?
The spirits will guide us.<eos> Really?<eos> No, not really.<eos> We're gonna interview witnesses to find out where they went 'cause that's what we do, we're lawmen.<eos> Tontos.
There are other agents outside the door.<eos> They're listening to everything we've said.<eos> Don't take me for a fool.<eos> McGee!<eos> Right here, boss.
She had a bright future ahead of her.<eos> As her C.O., I take this loss personally.<eos> We'd like to speak with her department head.<eos> You can wait in the wardroom with your other agents.<eos> What other agents?
I don't take orders from anyone.<eos> Anthony.<eos> Beverages.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Except her.
See, you have fought terror.<eos> Who better to create it?<eos> You're gonna have to find someone else.<eos> - It's too late.<eos> - Why?
To get the explosives into the arena after the concert started.<eos> Who gave 'em to you?<eos> Earl. Sure, it was Abby's idea to use the Caf-POW!<eos> , but the plan only worked because my performance was Oscar-worthy.<eos> Or at least a Golden Globe.
Nasty business.<eos> Yeah. Do you come from Brumarket?<eos> Uh, your accent. Did you grow up in Birmingham?<eos> That sounds like judgment.<eos> No, no, no.
The-the... the time, this thing I have...<eos> Since when?<eos> Since yesterday.<eos> I was gonna tell you tonight.<eos> Tonight?
That's exactly what we've been ordered to do.<eos> Yeah, well, that congresswoman can take her pause button and shove it up her ass.<eos> Gibbs has just let you back in.<eos> You fall out of line now and you're done.<eos> - Besides...
Look, I hear you. I do.<eos> But this is a marathon, Ellie... It's not a sprint.<eos> If you aren't willing to make the sacrifices and commit to the long haul, maybe you shouldn't be running this race.<eos> You really caught me off guard tonight.<eos> Especially with the bowling alley.
What's the problem, Ellie?<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> I want you to stop being afraid.<eos> I want you to admit that you can't breathe when you're not with me.<eos> And most of all...
Just talking about you.<eos> How much trouble am I in?<eos> With her?<eos> None.<eos> And you?
The shooter had to have passed it.<eos> I said no, Anna.<eos> What were you doing at Sheridan's?<eos> I was there having a drink, just like everyone else.<eos> With Judge Kinzie?
We have a punch card on the side of the vehicle.<eos> You've got to get this punchcard to the punch.<eos> The punch will be on a string maybe 2ft long from the tree, or maybe 1ft.<eos> So you've got to punch the number.<eos> - Like a hole puncher?
We believe that you, and you alone, can stop them.<eos> Okay.<eos> So, who's in charge?<eos> Who do we report to?<eos> My son.
You just have to let them think they have the power, but they never do, never, unless you give it to them.<eos> And don't ever give it to them.<eos> So it's... it's just about sex?<eos> I think you can do a little better.<eos> With Craig?
I bought a bar.<eos> What do you mean, you bought a bar?<eos> On Wisconsin and Tremont.<eos> The one with all the mermaids with the...<eos> - with the tits?
How do you live with yourself after what you did to your son?<eos> I've done things that I have to live with somehow.<eos> Okay.<eos> I try to do things, little things, anything, to show myself that the person who made those mistakes isn't who I really am.<eos> Like with your niece.
I'm meeting someone.<eos> Who?<eos> I just wanna know who he is.<eos> Okay, a businessman.<eos> What? A businessman.
Yeah, there's money behind the dryer, and... and... and shoeboxes in her room.<eos> Get his ass out.<eos> Check her bedroom.<eos> Check the dryer.<eos> Aquaman.
the body's buried along the back wall.<eos> How deep did you bury it?<eos> Just about 2 or 3 inches.<eos> We thought the concrete would save us, and we didn't have that much time.<eos> The gun with it?
You're a smart girl.<eos> And we should tell you the truth.<eos> Thanks.<eos> But not now.<eos> Next time.
- Gonna rob a boat.<eos> - Okay, what's my part in it?<eos> Every day, it amazes me.<eos> What?<eos> You.

I can't help you unless I know everything.<eos> I agree.<eos> Fun fact:<eos> I do not miss hospitals. Mm.<eos> Just the food, right?
Why did Agent Blye stop questioning?<eos> Because I think we're finally getting somewhere.<eos> I have nothing more to tell you.<eos> If you say so.<eos> Hetty.
If we could start a fire...<eos> They'd have to stop. And put it out or they'd risk blowing up the train.<eos> The germans would have to open the doors.<eos> What about the others?<eos> What others?
No.<eos> Did you get into an argument recently with anyone?<eos> Um, classmate, one of your roommates?<eos> No.<eos> No one.
Like what?<eos> Cars, sports.<eos> Most of the time we just complain about being incels.<eos> It's slang for involuntary celibate.<eos> But now, with Melinda...
You could have arrested her.<eos> Then our guys would have been killed instantly.<eos> Had to make it look like a rival to save their lives.<eos> Wrong decision?<eos> Definitely.
He will betray you...<eos> Maybe today, maybe next week.<eos> But if you want to stay here, you need to do it first.<eos> So, what, are we supposed to just rush in, get everyone out... hostage, terrorists alike...<eos> Before the strike?
Well, it makes perfect sense.<eos> Memory after memory.<eos> I killed people.<eos> That's who I was.<eos> A monster.
- You're a little nervous. Okay.<eos> - Yeah, yeah, I'm a little nervous. You know, I want to make a good first impression.<eos> - Oh, that makes sense.<eos> - How's my shake? Nope.<eos> No, no, no, no, no.
And if people think that the Congress and the President actually have a hand on this, they're gravely mistaken. They do not.<eos> This is where we get into the structure of secrecy.<eos> The structure of secrecy is complex, and multifaceted.<eos> We've been led to believe that we live in a mostly transparent democracy, with the President at the top of the intelligence food chain.<eos> A true Commander-in-Chief.
And this is a board member of Time Life and said,<eos> "The fourth estate is dead."<eos> I know reporters for Time Magazine who've told me specifically that they've provided the stories and their editors have spiked them.<eos> Yeah, the high level producer and directors...<eos> Cash.
We don't know when she's coming back.<eos> - Or if she's coming back.<eos> - She's coming back.<eos> She wouldn't just leave Tessa here.<eos> - With her step-mother?
I'm still trying to figure out who the hell he is.<eos> Callen is out of custody for the moment.<eos> Still working on Deeks and Sam.<eos> Are you at the hospital with Granger? No. I'm-I'm not.<eos> Hetty?
Why?<eos> Well, either logic says that she's the mole or she wanted us off the streets.<eos> She wanted us safe. While she does God knows what.<eos> She put a body in your trunk.<eos> Along with several kilos of cocaine.
I need that.<eos> - Cosima! - Just let me leave with my sister.<eos> We are keeping the kids here now.<eos> Yes, you're right to protect the children...<eos> From him.
It's not cheap to develop a new player, And the contract allows me to recoup my expenses.<eos> Speaking of contracts, You said you and jace had a disagreement. Over what he was worth?<eos> I just couldn't afford. To give him what he was asking for.<eos> But you had no problem. Coming to an agreement with jace's teammate,<eos> Dewey cussler.

- Legislative support?<eos> - Ah, buzzing bees, buzzing bees.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> Because the Manhattan Project had absolutely nothing to do<eos> - with business or politics.
This is just in.<eos> Secretary of State Catherine Durant to appear in front of the House Judiciary Committee.<eos> This comes as yet another surprise in the already dramatic...<eos> - When did it come in?<eos> - A short while ago.
-One organization, to be exact.<eos> -And he's meeting with me.<eos> Where is all this hesitation coming from?<eos> I just have a splitting headache.<eos> Gelsemium.
I didn't.<eos> I created this confusion in order to take advantage of it.<eos> Everything that has happened... was planned.<eos> Since when?<eos> Since before Elysian Fields.
I'm going to bed.<eos> No one will ever love you as much as I do.<eos> I hope you know that.<eos> Just as I know that no one will ever love me... like you.<eos> "Under the porcelain frog."
- I can neither confirm or deny anything.<eos> That's a shame.<eos> I had heard a rumour that you had recently become... unencumbered.<eos> The blonde woman's hunting grounds were the neighbourhoods affected by the Toronto Fire.<eos> - Hunting grounds?
Constables.<eos> Miss James, as well as Miss Baxter and Miss Roy from the Medical College for Women are joining us.<eos> Once the Constabulary finds a body buried under suspicious circumstances, Medical Inspectors, or Coroners, are called to the scene to give their opinion.<eos> Definitely deceased.<eos> - Definitely.
but it seems he was beaten to death.<eos> Multiple fractures on his skull and defensive injuries.<eos> He put up quite the fight, judging from the severe blows to his hands.<eos> From the size and shape of the contusions, they were inflicted with some force.<eos> Likely with a hammer.
No reason to think they'd stop at murder.<eos> - Do they still live there?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> But I'd stay clear if I were you.<eos> Badge or no badge.
Here ya go!<eos> Oh my God. Josh, you just have that kinda money lying around?<eos> Gabi, I'm rich.<eos> I have lots of money in my office.<eos> Next to my full-time security guard. Big guy, big, big guy!
How many jurors are in the initial pool?<eos> It's officers only, so Benny thinks about 30.<eos> Guess I'll gas up my car.<eos> And we are... going off the grid,<eos> - except for my computer...
Screw this.<eos> - And screw you. - Hey.<eos> Every time you're under stress, you look at this.<eos> Who's "M.L."?<eos> My friend Matt.
Well, to quote Frank Sinatra, who I met once at a restaurant,<eos> "Get out of my booth."<eos> Fine... with me.<eos> - Hey. Where do I park?<eos> - Between two lines.
And I'm not much of an agent if I can't sniff out a surprise.<eos> Well, we got one more for you.<eos> We know how badly you've wanted to wear one of these, so we got you... Please, don't say a hat.<eos> ...a hat.<eos> - Official NCIS team hat. - Whoo-hoo.
What have we got here, Loretta?<eos> Something out of a Salvador Dali painting, it would seem.<eos> Shoot.<eos> Um, guessing a fish didn't do that?<eos> Most definitely not.
Look, ladies, you're both pretty-- let's go.<eos> No bird poop, no salt deposits.<eos> No barnacle buildup.<eos> Considering this boat's been sitting here for six months, it's in dang good shape.<eos> Too good.

Susan Bryant has been mistreated, misrepresented and unjustly characterized.<eos> - Hey. - In our justice system.<eos> We'd like to ask the press to respect Susan's priva...<eos> So mock jurors who were parents didn't relate<eos> - to William and Donna?
- Extremely.<eos> Who will eventually date other cute people.<eos> I mean, why wouldn't we?<eos> Exactly, I mean, we're not a couple.<eos> Not... a couple.
How did we not think of that?<eos> I don't know, cute people are dumb.<eos> So... - the punch card is back on?<eos> - Mm-hmm. Back in business, baby.<eos> As long as...

I'll let you know.<eos> What's up?<eos> What did you do after work last night?<eos> - Went home.<eos> - With him?
I wanted to take them alive.<eos> They wanted to go out like Butch and Sundance.<eos> Who're you?<eos> I'm the guy who just rescued a zombie from being tortured live on the Internet.<eos> Along with my partner in crime here.
Which bank?<eos> Hard to say.<eos> I mean, if you worked in the DA's office, you'd just have the imprint scanned.<eos> But, if you don't, then I guess you have to get a list of the 342 banks in Seattle, start visiting them one by one, hope for the best.<eos> So uncool.
No.<eos> Look, check my pulse.<eos> Okay...<eos> You're human.<eos> And a doctor.
I haven't spent many Christmases in the palace.<eos> Over the years, I would use the holiday as an excuse to go home.<eos> At least, that was the official version.<eos> Unofficially, I would spend Christmas night with the man I loved.<eos> Not Simon.
Before you fled Russia, I asked Arkady to look in on Katerina.<eos> And I learned that she had a daughter... my daughter.<eos> You're a grandfather.<eos> And you an uncle.
Have fun.<eos> So Kensi's not the only one back at work.<eos> The moles have been identified or caught, and you still have your job.<eos> Mm, a small victory.<eos> At great cost.
All right, Nell, you should have the home security feed up now.<eos> Yep.<eos> Got 'em.<eos> I'll start scanning for anything suspicious now.<eos> Awesome.
Oh, just coming to check up on my patient.<eos> Oh.<eos> Your patient?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Kensi.
Kensi.<eos> She's, uh...<eos> she's back in the field.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Kensi.
That can't be true.<eos> I need you to find the pharmaco-toxicologist who, I believe, crafted the deadly cocktail and get the antidote from him.<eos> What do you know about him?<eos> There's a man, he told me he's known as...<eos> The Apothecary.
All of the assassins you know about share one common disadvantage when it comes to avoiding apprehension.<eos> They leave behind a corpse.<eos> And yet, there are times when a prolonged coma or a protracted illness will get the job done just as well.<eos> So, this Apothecary, how do we find him? Find the antidote?<eos> Ilario Panetti.
No. The waiter poured it from a bottle that was set aside.<eos> What bottle?<eos> Marvin Gerard.<eos> Aram, we need a list of all the stores that sell baby products in a 10-mile radius of the serpentarium.<eos> Baby stores?
What about a tox screen?<eos> We found traces of alcohol and MDMA in her system.<eos> It's exactly like the first two victims.<eos> Any sign of sexual assault?<eos> None.
How many suspects we looking at?<eos> Uh, it's too soon to tell, but I'd say just one.<eos> Each victim has a double tap to the chest.<eos> Someone was very handy with a weapon.<eos> Handy with electronics, too.
And I've never seen Elvis afraid of anyone.<eos> Worried Beck will come back, guns blazing.<eos> It's not just guns I'm afraid of here.<eos> A scandal then?<eos> Like with Mayor Hamilton?
Worried Beck will come back, guns blazing.<eos> It's not just guns I'm afraid of here.<eos> A scandal then?<eos> Like with Mayor Hamilton?<eos> Well, not just him.
This is what Rachel can't have.<eos> I think, this old man and Rachel...<eos> After babies, we will kill them. No.<eos> You're gonna take care of your babies.<eos> Miracle babies.

The sentiment is mutual.<eos> I've reviewed your work as a geneticist.<eos> It's impressive.<eos> Glad to be back from the abyss, and looking forward to working with you and Kira.<eos> Helena, too, soon.
- Oh, Felix, nooo!<eos> - She needs to talk to you.<eos> You... you've done something wonderful.<eos> Yeah. You are one of our best guys.<eos> - Along with Donnie and Scott and Art.
- Thank you.<eos> - But we have to go.<eos> You own me.<eos> - Yeah, you're mine.<eos> Incredible! Oh, my God!
she chose us as her own.<eos> We are who we are because she carried two little London urchins on her wings to Canada.<eos> Watching her raise my sister, watching my sister raise her own daughter... finding my biological sister, it's quite mad.<eos> It's taught me that we are all... mysterious works of chance.<eos> A choice of nature versus nurture.
And they're my past.<eos> You and Agnes are my future, and that's what I care about.<eos> You can care about us and look for the answers you need.<eos> Well, that's the thing, I'm not really looking for answers.<eos> Except for one.
You know who they are?<eos> FBI.<eos> - Your people are on site?<eos> - Yes.<eos> With all the necessary extradition documents.
You guys, when you're talking to your target, you're telling a story... The story of you.<eos> And it can be long or it can be short, but one thing it cannot be is boring! Right?<eos> Here's a secret.<eos> Before I was Blake Stone, I was a sad, lonely, insecure loser...<eos> Derek Sanders.
I can't hear anything!<eos> I can't hear anything, either!<eos> Whoa, slow your roll there, Bad Hair Day.<eos> Toss me one of them carbs.<eos> What, this?
It's implied.<eos> Why would you mess with greatness?<eos> No meatballs for you?<eos> No, I'm a vegan.<eos> Vegan?

Tendu said he was gonna pay you a hundred thou?<eos> He didn't say he would do it.<eos> He did it.<eos> Paid me on the spot.<eos> In cash?
He didn't say he would do it.<eos> He did it.<eos> Paid me on the spot.<eos> In cash?<eos> Brand new hundred dollar bills.
Want to play super smash ball?<eos> It's like dodge ball, except we're all ninjas.<eos> So, Alba, tell us more about Guatemala.<eos> Uh, okay. Well, the national flower is the White Nun Orchid,<eos> - and the national bird...
We're siphoning.<eos> Did your mom not teach you anything?<eos> You wouldn't last five seconds in the real world.<eos> This kid's all Pemberton and no Molng.<eos> No what?
Ooh, fancy pants.<eos> You going somewhere fun?<eos> Yeah, Kai is taking me out to dinner.<eos> Who's Kai?<eos> My fiancé.
Yeah, so we just got to make sure that Molng part rises to the top.<eos> What the hell.<eos> Teach me how to be a Mulk.<eos> It's Molng.<eos> Molnga.
You know, it's not easy trying to get a 21st century radio to communicate with a 22nd century time ship.<eos> Thawne never told you what he did with Rip?<eos> No, we weren't close like that.<eos> How you holding up?<eos> Better than Amaya.
- Yeah.<eos> Not for nothing, but Aruba would've been a better option.<eos> You're not real.<eos> You're an illumination.<eos> - A hallucination.
- What about the other Jax?<eos> Whoa, whoa, wait.<eos> There's a fake version of me, too?<eos> - Ray, whoever this bozo is, kick his ass!<eos> - With pleasure. - Okay. Huh.
German is useful... in Chicago?<eos> - Well... - Brett, what's going on?<eos> Okay, look.<eos> I am batting about a zero with men lately.<eos> Good men, bad men, all men.
Yes?<eos> What was that alderman's name from the breakfast thing we did last month?<eos> There were 30 aldermen.<eos> The tall one with the cute hair.<eos> Cute hair?
- he's gonna know about them. - Yeah.<eos> I just came from the house.<eos> That was the first rental I bought, 18 years ago. Can you believe that?<eos> What was your relationship like with the tenant,<eos> Dan Llewellyn?
Six months ago, he tried to take his own life, and he was placed with us.<eos> We'd been working with Kyle and his dad.<eos> They'd come so far. Yeah.<eos> Um, did you have any issue with the tenant next door?<eos> Dan? No.
- Who was he?<eos> Half a con artist living a double life.<eos> Hank, I think you got the wrong guy.<eos> Marvin, is this the man who approached you last night?<eos> You and your friend Jupiter?
No, I try to stay away from that stuff.<eos> You know, a pastrami sandwich can usually make things better.<eos> But not today.<eos> Does this have anything to do with that old case of yours?<eos> Hayden Watkins, yes.
5,700 branches, $2.3 trillion in assets, over 72 million clients.<eos> Well, 4,211 of those clients are victims.<eos> Yeah, out $100 million.<eos> Well, with the standard contingency fee, if we win, we win a third of the judgment.<eos> A third?
Did you disclose your own interest in the stocks to your clients?<eos> It was part of the pitch.<eos> What about when you were planning to sell?<eos> Did you disclose that?<eos> Sometimes.
- You too.<eos> I wouldn't be able to live with myself.<eos> What's up?<eos> - Who were you talking to?<eos> Myself.
Frankie's one of my best guys now.<eos> I'm a Prohibition Agent.<eos> Get out of here.<eos> You're a G-man?<eos> Not a very good one.
Why is everybody so obsessed with my fun levels?<eos> Because if something does come out of that seal, I want you at Peak Wynonna:<eos> Whisky, soaked and reckless.<eos> He's here.<eos> On the homestead?
It's great to see so many faces back in town for the first Annual Purg High Homecoming game!<eos> You have my word,<eos> Purgatory:<eos> We. Will. Turn.<eos> This. Town.
You have my word,<eos> Purgatory:<eos> We. Will. Turn.<eos> This. Town.<eos> Around!
You're confused.<eos> That's impossible. It'd just be wrong.<eos> I'll show you wrong.<eos> Hi, Doc! Great news: I know where Skip is!<eos> Hey, team.
Fine. Just be a good cop.<eos> It matters.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yes, it does.<eos> And Nicole...
Whereas I took the path too easy.<eos> I am living... and living, and living... proof that it is not always prudent<eos> - to strike deals with demons.<eos> - Doc, we have.<eos> In blood.
It's not big enough.<eos> Emma's a princess, and her wedding is a royal affair.<eos> You want to find someplace bigger, fine.<eos> Let's go find one.<eos> Happy to.
Let's say that Ferris was in here with Kensi when Callen called.<eos> Okay.<eos> Ferris is committed, he doesn't want to surrender, so the call forces him to adjust his plans and flee.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> With Kensi.
Or maybe you're just a little extra sensitive because you're feeling insecure about Mateo.<eos> Maybe.<eos> We'll see.<eos> I have to go meet with my editor.<eos> With my open mind.
Oh... please.<eos> No.<eos> That's not true.<eos> We're having lunch in Cooper City.<eos> At 11:00 a.m.
Eight seconds on the clock, fourth down and it's all tied up.<eos> It call comes down to this.<eos> Just flick it already.<eos> And he scores.<eos> With authority.
- What?<eos> - It's okay.<eos> We already empaneled a jury.<eos> Well, let's talk about your suit.<eos> Chunk.
Now he's dead.<eos> That's prejudicial and irrelevant.<eos> There is absolutely no correlation - between the two of them.<eos> - No correlation between Sean's death<eos> - and Withrow, Really? - Dr. Bull?
He's on the bus!<eos> He's on the bus.<eos> She's right.<eos> A real weasel. - Who the hell is Leo Getz?<eos> - Some lowlife lawyer.
About that thing with your wife today... can I offer you a bit of advice, based on my experience?<eos> Your experience and my wife's are totally different.<eos> She's a legal rock star.<eos> You're a... scam artist.<eos> Respectfully.
They transferred you right back here.<eos> - Okay, but what Stella means is...<eos> - Look...<eos> Thank you, both, for trying. Really.<eos> The other night, today, but...
Walk with me.<eos> Did I hear you say you knew the victim?<eos> Eric Cates.<eos> His sister called me from the hospital.<eos> - Tough.
Was he a dealer, a junkie, or a murderer?<eos> He did business with Creary, a gang leader.<eos> So you just assumed he was a...<eos> What did you call it?<eos> - Garbage.
Two more ran off as NOPD arrived.<eos> One marine took out six guys?<eos> Without firing a shot.<eos> Only weapon discharged apparently belongs to the victim.<eos> Morning, team.
And it's not doing you any favors.<eos> I've been honest.<eos> I'm slightly offended you keep suggesting otherwise.<eos> There's still plenty of time to get you transferred to a federal cell until we can figure this all out.<eos> On what charges?
You're gonna help the Aufieros steal that money or I will throw your sorry ass in jail.<eos> Hey, boys.<eos> Long time no see.<eos> Nice joint.<eos> Classy.
- So what brings you back?<eos> - The weather, mainly.<eos> And I miss the beach.<eos> - So, obviously you're a doctor.<eos> - Yeah. An orthopedic surgeon.
Did Russell really steal a bunch of ice off of Munchie?<eos> I heard it from one of Munchie's girls when I got picked up.<eos> And there was this... bag, this like... duffel bag in the van and Russell handed it off to some other car and I thought... maybe that's the stuff?<eos> He handed off the bag?<eos> - The red one? - Mm-hmm.
On the street?<eos> Was he staying there?<eos> - Was he...?<eos> - No, he was in a van.<eos> In a white van.
I wish I was this girl.<eos> You are that girl.<eos> Wow. Harsh.<eos> You know, you're that girl too.<eos> Sometimes.
- We can't do the paper any more.<eos> Why?<eos> Because Drew will cancel prom and everyone hates me enough as it is.<eos> So, I know I was, like, the worst date ever.<eos> Not the worst.
Obviously, Alicia took the bait...<eos> You're telling me an ex-FBI profiler gets mind-gamed into putting a razor to a cop's throat?<eos> This is Madison Gray we're talking about. All right?<eos> It's what she does. She manipulates people.<eos> Yeah, bad people, crazy people.
Grab me when you know more, okay?<eos> Did you know this was gonna happen?<eos> Am I just an asset you're working?<eos> Not "just," no.<eos> But an asset, first and foremost.
Nothing else?<eos> No other connections to the other murders other than how they were killed?<eos> Nothing we can find so far other than the obvious connection to Gordon.<eos> It's too obvious for my taste.<eos> Too clean, too.
The only option available To us is obedience.<eos> We're being turned Into caged rats, Distracted from the maze By the meaningless cheese.<eos> We're running after...<eos> Status, promotion, money,<eos> Nicer cars, bigger houses, More tvs,
Yeah, I have.<eos> Because of what I allegedly wrote?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What was it?<eos> Just between us.
For real?<eos> Yeah, all you gotta do is drop the cannabis thing, sign on the dotted line, that car and a quarter mil is yours.<eos> A quarter mil.<eos> - They're paying 250?<eos> - In cash. - Cash.
You did good, Savior.<eos> Thank you, Father.<eos> Welcome home, son.<eos> I've missed you so much.<eos> Both of you.
Really?<eos> I'm honored.<eos> Well, it is an honor, but with it comes great responsibility.<eos> For the next 24 hours, you and you alone will be the keeper of this most valuable treasure...<eos> The wedding rings.
Neither are you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Um... Ooh. I figured you'd know where to go.<eos> Earl Grey.<eos> Whole milk.
That's what you did.<eos> Why would you trust someone on the inside?<eos> He's in on it.<eos> Leon, um... have you talked to someone?<eos> Like a shrink?
What does this have to do with Anson Gephardt?<eos> This looks like more of his handiwork.<eos> The bombing can best be described as a bloody piece of political theater.<eos> As Kitty mentioned, the president of Venezuela was almost included in the body count.<eos> Emphasis on "almost."
I was in the shower.<eos> You were in the shower when Dembe came to the apartment?<eos> - I think so.<eos> - Where was Aram?<eos> In the shower with me.
I need information on a deceased couple.<eos> Tony and Maria Lopez of Ohio.<eos> They were apiarists.<eos> What?<eos> Ape fairies?
Yeah, no hard feelings, fellas.<eos> I've already forgotten about it.<eos> I'm too busy thinking about my hot date tonight.<eos> Yeah, right. "Hot date."<eos> With your left hand or your right hand?
What are you doing?<eos> Lieutenant, you're not authorized.<eos> Stop!<eos> Lieutenant, come back!<eos> Land immediately!
My-my girlfriend had a bad day at work, so I want to go cheer her up.<eos> Oh, that's a bummer.<eos> Where does she work?<eos> The NCIS Cyber office.<eos> With me.
You can't do that.<eos> Geraldine, where are my detectives?<eos> I have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> I'd like to speak with your supervisor.<eos> - My Commander?
There are a lot of jobs in amarillo that don't require being around blood and body organs all day long.<eos> It doesn't bother me.<eos> I know.<eos> But that was before.<eos> Before what?
It doesn't bother me.<eos> I know.<eos> But that was before.<eos> Before what?<eos> Before me.
I have nothing to say to him, and I don't want to hear anything he has to say to me.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> Lizzy is fine, now.<eos> But red says she's in danger.<eos> What kind of danger?
- You talked to her?<eos> - You care?<eos> Clay, what's going on?<eos> Really, mother?<eos> In front of him?
I'm here, aren't I?<eos> Unfortunately, so are you.<eos> Look, you were right.<eos> Clay's struggling, but not with work.<eos> Only you.
He's being investigated for tax evasion.<eos> Patterson turned over some hidden assets with an old friend from the SEC.<eos> So, the IRS is having a field day in his Park Avenue penthouse.<eos> I'm guessing, from my suit, I'm your...<eos> Bodyguard.
She stole my underwear.<eos> And the good china.<eos> And I will not tolerate that behavior.<eos> Well, then, Mom, how did you get here?<eos> The new girl.
If every other victim was injected in the back, that makes sense.<eos> They were strangers to the unsub, and if they were to turn around, they wouldn't have known the assailant.<eos> But if Alex had turned around, he'd have known the unsub.<eos> We gotta find out who he ate lunch with.<eos> Nobody.
I haven't spoken to her in three years.<eos> There'snowayitwill endwell.<eos> Don't be dramatic.<eos> You and Petra?<eos> Co-room moms?
Strikes the right balance between credible and gullible.<eos> What do you think of yours, Matelio?<eos> I look pretty good.<eos> Never settle for good.<eos> Only great.
The closest I came was with my eight-year-old costar in El Vaquerito.<eos> But that kid turned out to be a backstabbing diva who conveniently always had nap time when it got to my coverage.<eos> Okay, but you can't tell Mateo everything.<eos> I know. But it's just because I'm so happy to finally have the kind of bond I have with Matelio that I always wanted with my own...<eos> non-you child.
Really?<eos> That's how I see you.<eos> You're extraordinary, Petra.<eos> The way you handled everything when I went to prison.<eos> The girls, the hotel.
I'm sorry.<eos> I shouldn't have overstepped.<eos> And I shouldn't feel badly, right?<eos> I am clearly out of Chuck's league, right?<eos> _
I'm gonna text Dennis and call the date off.<eos> You are not.<eos> Michael's his friend, it feels like a betrayal.<eos> Michael would want you to be happy.<eos> With someone else.
- I'm just saying that I'm not his type.<eos> And-and he's not my type.<eos> Maybe not to date. But what about a fling?<eos> You ever open to that?<eos> With him?
My dad is a little overprotective.<eos> Well, don't worry.<eos> I totally understand.<eos> You're his little daughter.<eos> Not little.
Oh, come on.<eos> We got an airplane.<eos> If we didn't have tiny bottles, we'd be gigantic "bott-holes."<eos> Well, that one worked well.<eos> Down the hatch.
Jackson's gone into hiding, and you have no idea where he is?<eos> I haven't seen him in years.<eos> And Logan, that beacon of truth and justice, is a cop? - Yeah.<eos> - And Abe's a doctor?<eos> Like, a doctor doctor?
You wrote a book, and you're now absurdly rich.<eos> And I'm famous.<eos> So, what, you grew up in her fancy penthouse?<eos> Till I went to go live with Grandpa.<eos> Grandpa?
Like they care.<eos> Whoever this Jonah guy was, obviously understood that and used it to his advantage.<eos> Move.<eos> Move.<eos> On me.
What the...<eos> Relax.<eos> Concentrate on our destination.<eos> Become one with the green.<eos> With the green!
I'm just saying.<eos> You know, be gentle.<eos> Kirsten's a virgin.<eos> Ahh, I don't think she's a virgin.<eos> Emotionally.
Maybe...<eos> maybe I'm not remembering right.<eos> Then again, maybe you are, you know.<eos> I'm just trying to be a good scientist.<eos> Good scientist... or worried boyfriend?
The messenger bag is behind the rocks.<eos> What?<eos> There?<eos> No. No, no.<eos> No, with all the...
What?<eos> There?<eos> No. No, no.<eos> No, with all the...<eos> the bugs and the snake and the mud and the things and the...
Mm. Well. Lots of DNA being swapped at the club.<eos> Negative. Only Nic's and Sabine's.<eos> What were you doing at a club?<eos> No one.<eos> Nothing.
The body was stuffed into that cabinet.<eos> It's air-tight, which is why no one smelled him.<eos> I presume that you noticed the identical entry and exit wounds on his torso?<eos> Yeah, like he was stabbed clean through with something.<eos> With a sword, most likely.
So, how do you open this?<eos> I don't.<eos> So far, I'd say the only thing missing is a tie to go with this shirt.<eos> Is that an antique?<eos> Easily.
With chemotherapy, we actually give cancer patients poison, hoping that it'll kill more malignant cells than healthy ones.<eos> So, he's the cure to cancer now, is he?<eos> He's not the cure.<eos> A means to an end.<eos> A necessary evil?
So, he's the cure to cancer now, is he?<eos> He's not the cure.<eos> A means to an end.<eos> A necessary evil?<eos> No, just a lesser one.
I'm taking point on this one.<eos> You guys stay close, you stay sharp and stay safe.<eos> Fall back.<eos> Move!<eos> On me.
No.<eos> Do not-<eos> - No, no. Do not confuse me with my undercover personae.<eos> You know, the-the manic homeless guy, the charming yet chatty concierge...<eos> The annoying special agent.
How are you feeling? I mean, I'm feeling a bit like David Hasselhoff on Dancing with the Stars.<eos> No, you're killing it.<eos> Am I? Next, you're gonna spin me.<eos> I'm gonna spin you.<eos> Under the arm and then and back to you.
Actually... all of that was bad news.<eos> Actually, I... had started to think we were through the worst of it.<eos> But now... this.<eos> It's always darkest before the dawn.<eos> Or the next tornado.
Oh, is that offer for everybody?<eos> Nice try.<eos> I'm not going.<eos> Where's your bathroom?<eos> Mm, just down there.
It's totally different.<eos> Bert's money might run out, but I can beg until the end of time.<eos> All that and he's shorter than me.<eos> Sheldon, what did Amy have that attracted you?<eos> Oh, so many things.
Bert's money might run out, but I can beg until the end of time.<eos> All that and he's shorter than me.<eos> Sheldon, what did Amy have that attracted you?<eos> Oh, so many things.<eos> Her mind, her kindness, and especially her body.
I'm... looking for humans with... the Net Terminal Gene.<eos> Net Termi...?<eos> What's that?<eos> All humans had it... before the contagion.<eos> Before the contagion.
Everyone, get up here quickly! Hurry!<eos> In accordance with Elimination Ordinance 3, Clause 2, Elimination Level has risen by three.<eos> Requesting authorization to use Gravitational Beam Emitter.<eos> You are a body that was stolen from us, the Safeguard.<eos> A body.
Go, princesses, go.<eos> Really?<eos> What?<eos> I think you got me confused with someone else.<eos> Not so fast, Teresa Mendoza.
Thought she was with you.<eos> We have bigger problems than that.<eos> One of the horses did not take his medicine.<eos> We got ourselves a wild card.<eos> Don Epifanio.
I've tried to get you to hear me.<eos> You told Camila you wanted in.<eos> This is part of it. Things need to be taken care of.<eos> You mean people?<eos> Sometimes, yeah.
Dad turned his back on the cartel, and you turned your back on us.<eos> Is that what you think?<eos> Let me ask you something.<eos> If your father is such a saint, what is he doing here?<eos> With these people?
I know a way out.<eos> Garret. Garret!<eos> No!<eos> Damn it, no!<eos> Guero!
She doesn't know who you really are, but I do.<eos> You don't deserve her.<eos> Do you?<eos> I've been around people like you my whole life.<eos> Selfish.
You don't deserve her.<eos> Do you?<eos> I've been around people like you my whole life.<eos> Selfish.<eos> No loyalty.
Folks everywhere will know your name.<eos> Yeah?<eos> You will live a long life, Eli, and you will prosper beyond your dreams.<eos> What about Prairie Flower?<eos> - Who?
When Phineas gets back, he's gonna pitch a fit.<eos> I'm sincerely touched by your concern.<eos> Hey, uh, you want some company?<eos> I do not.<eos> Another time.
It was bad water killed my Liam.<eos> Bad water, plain and simple!<eos> I loved him. Attaboy.<eos> You feel good about this?<eos> About what?
My family has lived here for two centuries.<eos> How long have you lived here, Niles Gilbert? How 'bout you, Sheriff?<eos> Minister Frank, how long have you lived in this town? To me, you are all intruders.<eos> Carpetbaggers.<eos> Canallas.
And when you do, we're all gonna be there to cheer you on.<eos> Really? Well, how's that gonna happen?<eos> Peter, these guys have been sexually harassing me since the second I got here.<eos> Either you play, or every one of these Red Sox are going to jail...<eos> even Ted Williams.
I can't believe you.<eos> We grew up in this house.<eos> Will you lower your voice?<eos> Who is she?<eos> A new client, a good one.
Yes, really.<eos> Everything is okay.<eos> Well, I just came to check on your progress.<eos> As mayor of Storybrooke, can you blame me for taking a keen interest in all of our residents?<eos> All of your "troubled" residents.
Come on. I've got to show you something.<eos> Okay, well, unless we're waiting for a helicopter, I think we went the wrong way.<eos> We're here because this is the last place you saw your family.<eos> The last place you remembered who you really are...<eos> The Savior.
I care about you!<eos> Always have!<eos> And I worked tirelessly to reunite us!<eos> And now we can be a family again.<eos> And not just with Belle and Gideon.
Jesus? Dude?<eos> Mr. Kowalski, I walked the whole site myself, Okay?<eos> There's no evidence - of foul play.<eos> - What about the blood?<eos> The creepy noises?
Here's the plan.<eos> We follow up on Jeremy's research. And you,<eos> - get us...<eos> - Coffee and sugar for everyone?<eos> Cream and sugar.
I don't know why I brought that up.<eos> I'm... It's ancient history.<eos> Feels like yesterday to me.<eos> And now you're a...<eos> - cop.
With or without...<eos> Yeah.<eos> I miss him too.<eos> Even if he is a demon lizard.<eos> Dead demon lizard.
- So we're back?<eos> Call Doc, maybe he'll pick up for you, and tell him to meet us at the homestead for an emergency symposium.<eos> Awesome sauce!<eos> But what do we do<eos> - with demon spidey?
Look, you are the... the "Earpiest" Earp of them all.<eos> - I guess we're still fighting.<eos> - No, someone's coming up the...<eos> Do you have any idea when Doc's planning<eos> - stairs.
Stuff's happening for me, Holly.<eos> Don't fucking ruin it, OK?<eos> Try to have fun. This is your time too, remember.<eos> Do interns do all your customer checks?<eos> - Sometimes.
Drugs, extortion, intimidation.<eos> All very lucrative when you know what you're doing.<eos> But Florian wanted more.<eos> Florian wanted to hang out with the legitimate boys at the parties.<eos> The bankers, the entrepreneurs, the media moguls.
Life is rough in these streets, y'all!<eos> I think she wanted to keep the wedding gifts. ­.<eos> That's a big thing in China, mind you.<eos> Is your friend Chinese?<eos> - No, Methodist. - ­.
Hmm.<eos> Do you mind if I...<eos> No.<eos> But I warn you, I'm not very<eos> Good company. No problem.
You could show the teensiest bit of excitement.<eos> - We're not really smoothie people. - Oh!<eos> Success!<eos> Beautiful.<eos> Mm! Garnish.
Except that suddenly one felt like many.<eos> - Fractured.<eos> - Yeah. Or multiplied.<eos> - Becoming...<eos> - Legion.
- So your hand was severed.<eos> - Yeah, but it grew back.<eos> It grew it back like an evil starfish.<eos> And now it's in Wynonna and controls everything that she is.<eos> With killer instincts and a magical gun.
Open it!<eos> OK! Drink!<eos> Drink it! Come on!<eos> Swallow! OK!<eos> Mikshun...
- It is right now! Right now, I have time.<eos> Well, only a certain amount.<eos> Hence my question.<eos> Look, Waverly... my one Boss just got her head blown off, and my other Boss is a lizard.<eos> Or a tiny, super sexy dragon.
Into the hip.<eos> Won't need it.<eos> Funny story.<eos> Peacemaker has decided it's an alarm clock.<eos> - And a taser.
It's just, I need to talk to Doc.<eos> You're amazing.<eos> You're just... You're an amazing agent...<eos> Earp.<eos> Just an amazing agent.
You know what's so strange?<eos> She knows me, but there's nothing that connects us other than our past.<eos> It's like we existed in two separate universes...<eos> Me in my crazy one and she in her...<eos> Normal one?
It's like we existed in two separate universes...<eos> Me in my crazy one and she in her...<eos> Normal one?<eos> Is that what you want?<eos> A normal life?
- You're new here.<eos> You can wait your turn.<eos> Now, why don't you guys go ahead?<eos> I'll take care of this.<eos> "This"?
Really, Owen?<eos> Is that what I am now... "this"?<eos> Okay, I don't know what you are, drunk maybe?<eos> No.<eos> Stupid.
Why are you running this piece?<eos> I'm sorry. I know.<eos> - I'm leaving, Clay.<eos> - You're staying, Max, because you're not the kind of girl that throws a temper tantrum.<eos> "The kind of girl"?
Great.<eos> That's cool.<eos> And I work with the big children.<eos> Yes.<eos> Big and old.
The X-ray showed free air in her abdomen, which means her bowel was perforated.<eos> It's why she's in so much pain.<eos> - From a rape?<eos> - We haven't gotten the results from the SART exam, but everything I've seen is consistent with a vicious assault.<eos> - Kim!
Get down!<eos> Stay down!<eos> - Where's Kim?<eos> - She's in the back. Go.<eos> Kim!
Are you sure about that?<eos> Because things are seeming a little biblical around here.<eos> I mean, last night with the rats and then today with the hacks.<eos> - Rats?<eos> What rats?
Well, we're not gonna close him back up and send him to radiology just to wind up where we are now, so let's ultrasound the heart directly and see if we can't find the bullet.<eos> There, in the right ventricle.<eos> Yeah, that could be our culprit.<eos> Scalpel?<eos> Forceps?
Special hugs are for grown-ups who really love each other, not kids.<eos> That's right!<eos> So that's what you and Daddy did to make me?<eos> Um... You know what? Like, if you want me to come back, maybe I can just...<eos> Ugh. Okay.
Yeah, this is Mandy.<eos> Hey, Mandy.<eos> So, I begged and pleaded with Mrs. Kim, but she was adamant.<eos> She doesn't want your kind running the salon.<eos> "My kind"?
So, I begged and pleaded with Mrs. Kim, but she was adamant.<eos> She doesn't want your kind running the salon.<eos> "My kind"?<eos> She said...<eos> My... My kind.
Well, we found the store that Saigon made that call from.<eos> Looks like her story checks out.<eos> And I got somebody looking into that Titus thing, too.<eos> It worked.<eos> The corner store?
This is... what?<eos> A stash of medical equipment?<eos> Looks like Krilov was here to manipulate some memories.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But whose?
You heard me.<eos> Selma Orchard.<eos> Kaplan sent Krilov to Orchard?<eos> - I don't like the connection.<eos> - To me?
When was the last time you saw her?<eos> Last week. Last Thursday.<eos> Why?<eos> Oh, did I tell you? She friends with any of them?<eos> All of them.
I'd see a woman's ankle.<eos> The way her fingertip would touch an elevator button.<eos> How she'd put her hair behind her ear.<eos> And all that time, the wave would get bigger.<eos> The tow stronger.
More blood?<eos> You used to believe that people were worth saving.<eos> I was wrong.<eos> Skaikru taught me that people are cruel and violent and selfish to the core.<eos> Not Lincoln.
And, yes, I got most of these questions from a "Do You Know Your Partner" quiz in O Magazine.<eos> I used to put a lot of walls up.<eos> She somehow found a way to get inside them.<eos> Worst thing... same answer.<eos> _
Last question.<eos> Why did you choose to work with your partner and why did they choose to work with you?<eos> I chose to work with my partner because he was... honest, loyal, and I trusted him with my life.<eos> As for him, uh, he didn't choose to work with me, he was forced to.<eos> _
- What about the material.<eos> - It's with me. We're still on schedule, but we can't afford any more problems.<eos> About that.<eos> It looks like the FBI may have the Truman Protocol.<eos> What?
Parker, this is Riva.<eos> Special Agent Zapata.<eos> - What?<eos> - You're a Fed?<eos> No, not just any Fed.
All government facilities.<eos> There's gotta be some other connection that we're just not seeing.<eos> Maybe we're asking the wrong questions.<eos> I mean, what does Shepherd want?<eos> Besides mass terror?
Jo Jo doesn't leave the house much, except to go to a private tutoring center.<eos> She attended class as recently as yesterday.<eos> And I got the address and her schedule right here.<eos> - Let's get that to Adam and Kev.<eos> Chief.
- Sarge, we need you to...<eos> - Not now!<eos> - It's gotta be now. - Not now! Boss, damn it, I need to talk to you.<eos> - This better be good.<eos> Chief.
I don't want you to be next.<eos> So, what do I do?<eos> Just tell them you changed your mind.<eos> And don't talk to anyone, okay?<eos> Not your advocate, not the State's Attorney, not the police.
A three-time convicted felon charged with multiple armed robberies?<eos> Well, he never brought that around me.<eos> He was fun.<eos> I thought he was the one.<eos> The one what?
Good.<eos> Then I came up here for nothing.<eos> There he is. Hey, Hank!<eos> I'm glad I caught you.<eos> Chief.
This was supposed to save me money, not cast me.<eos> Leon is starting community college in Florida, and Cruz is footing the bill.<eos> I get this new bouncer gig and that helps, but...<eos> What about me?<eos> For a roommate.
I will see you all at the end of the day to check on your dolls.<eos> So a kid got beat up.<eos> What does he need a psychiatrist for?<eos> Well, Elliot was caught peeping on girls<eos> - in the shower at school.
In a few hours, we may lose our last chance at survival.<eos> Losing my humanity is a high-class problem.<eos> Darius says he's ready to talk.<eos> - Finally.<eos> - Not to you.
Losing my humanity is a high-class problem.<eos> Darius says he's ready to talk.<eos> - Finally.<eos> - Not to you.<eos> To her.
We know what's critical.<eos> High IQs, genetic health, fertility, skill sets, but...<eos> - what do we prioritize?<eos> - Well, what about artists?<eos> Musicians, poets.
The government is done with Tanz Industries.<eos> We've lost control of space.<eos> We're out of options.<eos> Darius is our best hope right now.<eos> Our best hope?
Yeah. Probably all of Tanz Industries' secrets.<eos> Or the answer to his murder.<eos> This is where he lived?<eos> He was a quiet man.<eos> With demons.
Liam?<eos> I didn't mean to wake you up.<eos> Where have you been?<eos> Um... research.<eos> Off-campus.
My parents... they never expected much from me.<eos> And, to be honest, they never got it, you know?<eos> But, uh... God, if they could see me now, huh?<eos> You know, delivering my own baby.<eos> An OB-GIN.
"Carol Andrew Pilbasian Miller has died."<eos> She was remembered as a survivor of the virus, "a master bedazzler..."<eos> What else?<eos> God, make it stop!<eos> And a big fat coward.
T, where are you at? T!<eos> - ( line ringing ) - ( phone ringing ) - Yo, what's up? - Yo, where are you at, man?<eos> - Then why didn't you answer me? I just did!<eos> What's wrong with you?<eos> Man, where the gefilte fish at?

Kennedy... was single.<eos> I had... relocated to Kobe earlier this year to set up our offices there.<eos> I worried about her.<eos> I wanted her to have a gun so she could protect herself.<eos> From anyone in particular?
Kennedy was more outgoing.<eos> More self-assured.<eos> Dismissive of authority.<eos> Always ready to argue.<eos> - With you?

The topic came up.<eos> What was Kennedy's position when the topic came up?<eos> Kennedy was pro-gun.<eos> And Bethany?<eos> Anti-gun.
- Yes.<eos> After class?<eos> Sometimes, but it's not what you're suggesting.<eos> He was my teacher. That's all.<eos> - Your favorite teacher?
How many people have you showed this to, Sam?<eos> Oops, made it worse.<eos> Why would you make a list about Paige?<eos> To help me decide if I want her to be my girlfriend or not.<eos> Girlfriend?
No, they want me to start right away.<eos> What do you guys think?<eos> Wow. That's exciting.<eos> There's a lot to discuss.<eos> Yeah, for sure.
Thank you.<eos> Aku, my boss-man, you will not believe what I just went through, babe.<eos> What?<eos> !<eos> Scaramouche.
Not the waist, you stabbed back of his neck.<eos> Do what you did before.<eos> Alright...<eos> Hey, do you have a stopwatch?<eos> Stopwatch?
I didn't expect a snake to emerge during landscaping.<eos> Is that so?<eos> Mr. Gu, I must be the snake then.<eos> Of course not.<eos> Definitely not more than that.

- Yes, well done.<eos> No, Bridget knows what she's doing. Right.<eos> Well, ah... we should celebrate your good news then. - Yep.<eos> Yeah. Oh, yeah.<eos> - Tonight. - All right.
You're supposed to deal with this.<eos> I don't get it, Kaz.<eos> You hate drugs, just as much as Bea did.<eos> I had to do a deal.<eos> With who?
Nah, it wouldn't.<eos> 'Cause Maxie'd still be here, eh?<eos> I reckon you need a job or a hobby or somethin',<eos> - love, to keep ya busy.<eos> - Mmm. - Like what?
Mmm.<eos> It's times like these I crave my insomnia pills.<eos> Anyway, I've been lying awake, thinking it over... and I've worked it out.<eos> I know who Witness X is.<eos> Mmm, who?
Fuck you ask a lot of questions.<eos> Do I?<eos> That's another one.<eos> Oh, sorry!<eos> 5:30.
Unfortunate.<eos> Don't let it get catastrophic.<eos> You got two weeks.<eos> Scotty, fix me a drink.<eos> - Two olives.

But you didn't want to hear that, so you called the bad idea lady.<eos> I'm your sister.<eos> Abby, we have bigger problems than dresses right now.<eos> I don't. I just have the dress problem.<eos> Enough with the dress.
I'll be a 42-year-old who Hasn't had sex in five years, who has a child, whose father is still in his 20s and has his whole life ahead of him.<eos> And even then... even then with all my mistakes piled around me like the empty pizza boxes from last night's depression feast, even then I will not give you that dress. But you'll think about it, right?<eos> Hi, milkshake.<eos> Yeah, yeah, my milkshake is in the freezer for five years.<eos> You okay?
Billie.<eos> That's sweet. It is, isn't it?<eos> Ooh, I gotta wrap this up.<eos> I got a date.<eos> We good?

She'd write her manifestos about how technology was destroying the world.<eos> Then one day... the police came and they run.<eos> It's strange.<eos> I see her in so many young women.<eos> On the street, in my dreams.
Death sometimes just sneaks up on you.<eos> It's been a while since I played hot potato.<eos> I'm in this hospital bed.<eos> I'm barely conscious.<eos> Delirious.
"Today's the day you die."<eos> I'm touched.<eos> Can I have my jacket, when you get a sec?<eos> Then a man comes along, tells me a story about a drought in California.<eos> About skateboards and swimming pools.
What about Judge Dawkins?<eos> Nobody cares that he signed off on Ed's plea deal.<eos> We're not talking about Judge Dawkins. We're talking about my brother.<eos> We're talking about you.<eos> Okay.
I wish. I could be a better husband to you.<eos> It's just a poker game, dear.<eos> You don't have to feel so guilty.<eos> Sometimes, boys just need to be with other boys.<eos> - You all right?
Bina!<eos> Walter, would you come with me, please?<eos> Yeah. I'm flattered.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> Goodbye.
What?<eos> Sorry, why am I here?<eos> Not that.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Okay.

Okay, but the only reason we stayed in was because we weren't invited to any senior parties.<eos> I just, bottom line, don't want to have to deal with that today.<eos> Okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> All right.
Would you like a canapé, Herr Heck?<eos> It looks delicious, but no. Thank you.<eos> This is Magda Gross, the sculptress.<eos> Perhaps you know of her.<eos> Indeed, yes.
- No. Your men are hungry.<eos> Your officers, they need meat.<eos> Uh, we need to keep the zoo in operation, Lutz.<eos> We'll raise pigs in the pens to feed your men, and we will save our zoo.<eos> Pigs.

Yeah.<eos> I'm... I'm a father?<eos> Kind of.<eos> I am a father.<eos> Why not?
The Trident is Jack's only hope.<eos> The dead are conquering the sea, unable to step on dry land.<eos> Maybe you should retire to the countryside.<eos> Do you mean grass?<eos> On a farm?
I would say that swimming is no longer his primary concern.<eos> The map is there.<eos> - Where?<eos> - On the tip of your finger?<eos> In the heavens.
That's a tale I wanna hear.<eos> What a truly revolting sight!<eos> Make way!<eos> Captain Jack Sparrow on deck.♥<eos> Indeed!

Do you know that I was the only one who believed in you?<eos> Everyone else said I was crazy to recruit a 14-year old kid.<eos> - I'm 15.<eos> - No, this is where you zip it!<eos> All right?
- Sorry doesn't cut it.<eos> - I understand.<eos> I just wanted to be like you.<eos> And I wanted you to be better.<eos> Okay.
If you're nothing without this suit, then you shouldn't have it.<eos> Okay?<eos> God, I sound like my dad.<eos> I don't have any other clothes.<eos> Okay.

You have no information.<eos> Wait.<eos> And just over this Ridge that's the quickest way to Bogota.<eos> We're going to swing over to the other side.<eos> One at a time.
You remember my platonic friend, Barb?<eos> Oh, Barb!<eos> We were supposed to go to the Arizona gem show but instead, I'm here, fucking with you.<eos> You should know that Barb spent her life in special ops.<eos> Not that bullshit regular ops.

- But not monkeys.<eos> - You're still way ahead on dead monkeys. - They used to be a thing.<eos> - You just have to make things... - We're wasting time.<eos> He's dead, and I accept the risks, so can we get to it, or do you two need a timeout?<eos> Fine and dandy.

How about you? What you thinking about?<eos> What am I thinking about? Uh...<eos> I'm thinking about a royals game.<eos> A royals game... A tecate...<eos> And garlic fries.
Diminished responsibility.<eos> If that Cunt in the original trial had put on a proper defense of diminished responsibility, I could've walked out that door a free man.<eos> I think, for you, that the best policy...<eos> Did you mention it?<eos> - At the hearing?
Simon.<eos> So, what you been up to for 20 years?<eos> I've been in Amsterdam.<eos> - Nice.<eos> - All right.
My face is not seen.<eos> Do you have any identifying marks?<eos> Tattoos on your buttocks?<eos> Certainly not.<eos> On your perineum?

What, is it about him?<eos> - It's about all of us, like.<eos> - All of you?<eos> About me?<eos> - No, not about you.
My daughter's life is in danger. Why do you laugh?<eos> It's not a joke.<eos> His castle is hidden in the woods.<eos> It's already winter there.<eos> Winter in June?
Who wouldn't be skeptical when a man claims to have spent an entire weekend with God?<eos> In a shack, no less.<eos> And not just any shack.
How about some dinner tonight?<eos> Maggie made chicken pot pie.<eos> Nah, Nan left me food in the fridge.<eos> - Maybe next time.<eos> - All right.
Nah, Nan left me food in the fridge.<eos> - Maybe next time.<eos> - All right.<eos> Thanks.<eos> All right.

Mack!<eos> Hey!<eos> We're home!<eos> - Hey, Dad.<eos> - Hey, champ.
Well, maybe it'd been out there for a few days and I didn't see it.<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's completely crazy.<eos> But I gotta do something, and this is all I got.<eos> Okay.
I know that you are wrestling with something.<eos> And it's okay if you don't know how to talk about it.<eos> It's just that we've lost so much already.<eos> I don't wanna lose you, too.<eos> Okay?
Just in case.<eos> Where's your pole?<eos> I didn't know we were goin' fishin'.<eos> We should probably have something to do when we finally figure out I've lost my mind.<eos> All right.
Or you can go talk to Papa in the kitchen.<eos> Your choice.<eos> I know this is overwhelming, but... you're gonna be all right, Mack.<eos> I'll be finishing up a project in the workshop, if you wanna stop by.<eos> Okay.
No. It's okay.<eos> I didn't make it.<eos> It is good.<eos> That was the best meal I've had.<eos> Ever.
I'll wash, you dry?<eos> I'll take this round.<eos> Why don't you show Mack some of your handiwork?<eos> Wanna take a look?<eos> Okay.
There's something very special I want to plant here tomorrow.<eos> To prepare the ground, we have to dig up all the roots, or they'll return and harm the new growth.<eos> - But this is gorgeous.<eos> You can start over there.<eos> Okay.
Their clothes.<eos> Their body language.<eos> By all accounts, you're a well-practiced expert, Mackenzie.<eos> Sit.<eos> All right.
She's more than okay.<eos> She's happy.<eos> She's beautiful.<eos> She's so beautiful.<eos> Hey, champ.
That's a good girl.<eos> That's a good girl.<eos> Open your legs now.<eos> That's it. Wider.<eos> Wider.
I know, sweetheart, but you have to stay out of the sun.<eos> Your father's asked you twice to stay out of the sun.<eos> Hey, chief.<eos> Everything's gonna be fine.<eos> Just like in the pirate stories.
I just want you to know I was just being really, really honest and...<eos> Thanks.<eos> Hey, I might need to get into the office, get some of my old notes and such, okay?<eos> Sure.<eos> After hours.
Light.<eos> That one's called Stop Light.<eos> Please stick around.<eos> So, Ray, uh, what'd you think?<eos> Of what?
That one's called Stop Light.<eos> Please stick around.<eos> So, Ray, uh, what'd you think?<eos> Of what?<eos> Of the poem.
You put all that on one card table right in the middle of the room and a little sign that says,<eos> "Everything on this table, hundred bucks."<eos> People will go nuts.<eos> Everything for a hundred bucks.<eos> On the table.
Christmas party?<eos> No, I hate holidays.<eos> Right.<eos> Now, wait, you're in the greetings industry.<eos> Romance, purely.
It sounds super-exclusive and sexy and food art.<eos> Like going to France.<eos> During the German occupation, maybe.<eos> Look, I'm sure we're gonna get a great table...<eos> -Great table at a great restaurant... -For God's sake. -Great dinner in great company...
History is over. Everything is happening in this second.<eos> -Hello.<eos> -Dad?<eos> -Yeah, Michael, where are you?<eos> -Home.
You don't know?<eos> Sometimes you just have to let Paul go be Paul.<eos> But, listen, I want to talk about this press conference.<eos> There won't be one.<eos> For now.
Someone always gets hurt.<eos> Like in politics, right? And every family that ever was.<eos> Okay, so what happens now?<eos> Some impossible happy ending?<eos> Weird fucking fairy-tales, Stan.
I am a nurse.<eos> Was.<eos> In Mexico City.<eos> When did that happen?<eos> This morning. Near the border.
Use your powers.<eos> This is business. They are making soldiers.<eos> Killers.<eos> These are babies of mutantes...<eos> - North Dakota.
Munson!<eos> Come out here now!<eos> Come out here now, Munson.<eos> There's that asshole.<eos> Hello, asshole.
What'd he have?<eos> Who?<eos> The man, dummy, the one with the box.<eos> What was in the box?<eos> The one on the subway.
Other than that, he seems fine physically.<eos> We're gonna run some tests on him, and hopefully, it'll give us a clearer picture.<eos> - Has he had any problems at school?<eos> Nothing that we're aware of.<eos> - Home?
I let Lucy sleep in.<eos> She hasn't been sleeping well.<eos> You want me to wake her?<eos> Guess maybe wake her in 15 if she's not up yet.<eos> Okay.
- I really doubt it.<eos> I think I would know if he had come in last night.<eos> - Yes, of course.<eos> I didn't...<eos> - Okay.
Oh, no. Oh, Luce, what happened?<eos> It's gonna be okay. All right?<eos> Everything's gonna be okay.<eos> You're gonna be okay.<eos> All right.
Do you always practice your English... Chatting up foreigners?<eos> What?<eos> No. No.<eos> I work in a sport school.<eos> What sort of sports?
A wolf.<eos> There's a bar upstairs, erm, if you wanted to...<eos> Come... actually, it's more like a... kinda crappy rooftop.<eos> I'm afraid I have to meet someone.<eos> Otherwise, I...
Probably a nice guy, but a bit of a worm and a sneak.<eos> Mr. Strickland, reputation of a hot-head.<eos> Scary, yet effective with the students.<eos> Do I trust either of them?<eos> Absolutely not.
As Lallan said, it's Eid.<eos> People even pay 1000 for a goat.<eos> 1000?<eos> Who will pay 1000 here in Fatehpura?<eos> Not in Fatehpura but in Mumbai.
I can see that.<eos> Give me in writing what you just said.<eos> I'll release him right away.<eos> What?<eos> In writing?

There is something in you, boy ...<eos> - ... something evil.<eos> - Wait.<eos> Was there truth to what he said?<eos> About your father.
Your mother wants to know if you're eating properly.<eos> 'Listen, Dad, could you do me a favour? '<eos> - What?<eos> 'Could you just check something on my car? '<eos> - Your car?
Oh, I see, yes.<eos> Looks very... fully functioning.<eos> Is that really the best you can do?<eos> Sorry, I've never been very good with them.<eos> Babies?
Looks very... fully functioning.<eos> Is that really the best you can do?<eos> Sorry, I've never been very good with them.<eos> Babies?<eos> Humans.
The merchant goes to a different city and is perfectly fine.<eos> Goodnight, Mycroft.<eos> Then he becomes a pirate, for some reason.<eos> Keep me informed.<eos> Of what?
My name is Sherlock Holmes.<eos> Goodbye, Sherlock Holmes.<eos> You're out of time.<eos> Tell me about your boss, Moriarty.<eos> Who?
"The mathematics of probability"?<eos> You believed that.<eos> "Feasible variables"?<eos> Yes, I started to run out about then.<eos> In the memory stick!
To explain why the ancient craft has yet to be disposed of.<eos> Destroyed.<eos> The harlot captured. And eliminated.<eos> You know that I will ultimately follow your orders.<eos> Ultimately?

Yeah, Trini!<eos> [Both] Hai! Ready, master Billy?<eos> [groans] You need to learn the element of surprise.<eos> Ready? Let's go again.<eos> All right, Billy, lighter on your feet.
You gotta be kidding me.<eos> That thing looks like it's made out of pure tetanus.<eos> I know she ain't pretty to look at, but it's nothing a couple of extra hands can't fix.<eos> Unless you got a better idea, I suggest we get cracking.<eos> All right.
Okay, colonel.<eos> You'll find your sea stallion three Klicks up that Ridge.<eos> Now, I'm gonna take these civilians back to the boat.<eos> And we'll wait for you there.<eos> All right?
Saddle up!<eos> Let's go kill this thing!<eos> Steve, you running with the big dogs or staying on the porch?<eos> I don't wanna be on the porch.<eos> Marlow, you okay?
I wanna go home.<eos> We get it.<eos> There was no island.<eos> We were never on an island.<eos> Island?

And your shoes.<eos> There we go.<eos> Uh... This is really uncomfortable.<eos> Sorry. My shoes are part of my pants.<eos> - Batman?
Are you trying to tell me that Bruce Wayne is Batman 's roommate?<eos> Uh... Yeah.<eos> Evil army, this way to the Batcave!<eos> Good grief!<eos> Hey, Batman!
That's a stupid idea.<eos> Okay, guys. Game plan.<eos> Joker's taken the Projector<eos> - to Wayne Manor.<eos> - Wayne Manor. Right. Thanks, Batman.

Yeah, I don't think you'll need snowshoes, but could you grab that flashlight?<eos> - Batman? - Padre?<eos> Sir?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Hey, Batman.
Alfred, put that kid on the next jet to the orphanage.<eos> But doesn't he deserve a chance for someone to take him under their wing, as I took you under mine?<eos> Listen, you don't have a family.<eos> So what do you know about having a surrogate son?<eos> Batman!
That's right.<eos> We need sick new vehicles.<eos> An arsenal of advanced weaponry.<eos> Costumes that suit our individual personalities.<eos> Rip!

Otherwise, why would you come here to see me?<eos> I don't know shit.<eos> I'm trying to figure out what's going on.<eos> Every word I have ever told you is the truth.<eos> Okay.
I know. But where?<eos> What... what you said before about, uh, a monastery, is that all true?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - In China?<eos> - In... in K'un-Lun.
But his smile...<eos> I must have had that dream a hundred times.<eos> too.<eos> When?<eos> In the hospital.
You mind if we go inside?<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's cool.<eos> Danny.<eos> Okay.
It seems like that's all anyone wants to talk about.<eos> Because it's the only language that they speak.<eos> And it is important that you learn to understand it if you want to win.<eos> They're supposed to be my friends. but I cannot help you make friends.<eos> Okay.
And here we are.<eos> Already?<eos> What is this? I thought we were headed to a restaurant.<eos> We'll get there.<eos> But first things first.
uh... really went above and beyond last night.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You want to tell me what's so important about this pier?<eos> It's just an acquisition we need.<eos> For the future.
uh... I broke my arm skateboarding.<eos> sure.<eos> The X-rays from that period are on that shelf to your right.<eos> too.<eos> Okay.
It's my name.<eos> And it means something.<eos> - Mmm. but I can't prove it.<eos> We need another plan.<eos> Okay.
- Thank you. - Danny.<eos> That answer was much kinder than we deserved.<eos> Kindness is the eternal law.<eos> have you got time to go through that pier deal you put through?<eos> The pier?
Do you have someone?<eos> Let's just get this over with.<eos> If it sounded like I was prying earlier, I apologize.<eos> I'm not good at this stuff.<eos> What stuff?
The Hand's version of a challenge.<eos> Their best fighters against me.<eos> If I defeat them, they'll meet my demands.<eos> You've done this before?<eos> In K'un-Lun, yeah.
- You heard I was on the floor? - Mmm.<eos> - I've been here 30 seconds. - Mmm-hmm.<eos> - Friend of yours?<eos> - Something like that.<eos> Okay, fine.
Well, I have a pretty big office.<eos> - Danny.<eos> - Oh, Joy, I was just about to...<eos> We need to talk.<eos> Now.
That's all lies. I...<eos> I'm done with lies.<eos> You deserve to know.<eos> Know what?<eos> Everything.
I don't.<eos> got anything better than this?<eos> sir. - Ugh.<eos> You got any bourbon?<eos> In the... in the compartment to your right.

Or they faked her defection to get her on the inside with us. - It's what they do.<eos> - That's not why she's here.<eos> She's running from them.<eos> - She's on our side.<eos> - Fine.
No, no need.<eos> Ward and I are here.<eos> You should get some rest.<eos> You've earned it.<eos> Okay.
I don't care.<eos> What?<eos> I got your text.<eos> but I don't know the combination.<eos> All right.

I don't know much, but I know where people go to get off the grid.<eos> - Does this mean you're taking the case?<eos> - I want my key back.<eos> And get out of my apartment!<eos> Still in the force?
- Especially if it's damaged.<eos> Matthew, I want to talk frankly.<eos> - Please.<eos> - This other life you led... is your heart still with it... or is your heart with the one who walked through it by your side?<eos> Elektra. Yeah.
How's things?<eos> Good.<eos> Big office.<eos> Far from what we dreamed about doing when we were kids, but at least I get to see Marci a lot.<eos> - After hours.
Not long-term.<eos> But right now... it's the best I got.<eos> What if it doesn't work?<eos> Then we tried anyway.<eos> All right.
The difference is I live on their block.<eos> The difference is I'm not some billionaire white boy who takes justice into his own hands and slams a black kid against the wall because of his personal vendetta.<eos> Claire told me about you on the way over here.<eos> Not all the mystical parts, but everything else.<eos> The money?
Welcome back, Mr. Rand.<eos> Mr. Meachum mentioned you had business to take care of abroad. Uh, yeah.<eos> That's what brings me here.<eos> Where is Ward?<eos> On a business trip himself.

I know him.<eos> Deep down inside... he is still just a kid looking for his family.<eos> With me... and with them... almost had it.<eos> Can we talk?<eos> About?
And you?<eos> You wanted more than K'un-Lun.<eos> That's why you abandoned it, isn't it?<eos> They told me all about you.<eos> About your struggle.
Ah, that's why you're still chained to your master.<eos> You're gonna fail here, just as you failed K'un-Lun.<eos> You should've heard the way they screamed when I killed them.<eos> They gone, Matt?<eos> Yeah, for now.
I don't hate it.<eos> It's almost like you're back in business.<eos> Yeah, almost.<eos> How you doin'?<eos> Yeah, okay.
Hey, how's it going?<eos> - I thought you were in Amsterdam. - Oh, just for a day.<eos> Then London, then New York, now here.<eos> - Have you slept?<eos> - A few hours on the plane.

- Sure.<eos> - Great.<eos> - I take it last week you were too busy to set up your company social account, and I don't think you've imported your old profile.<eos> Sorry, I've just been kind of overwhelmed so far.<eos> - No, in a good way.

It was.<eos> There was almost a full moon, and it felt like... felt like I was paddling through liquid silver.<eos> It sounds incredible.<eos> But there's no record of any of it.<eos> - Not outside my own memory.

We're supposed to get some coffee, But I don't think that's a good idea.<eos> Coffee?<eos> I would like some coffee. Maybe some warm milk.<eos> For the cat.<eos> On the roof?
Thank you. Thank you, mr. Jackpots.<eos> I'm so thankful I got A chance to say thank you again.<eos> Thank you again.<eos> Here it is.<eos> Ah. Ah.
Course, we're hoping for the best.<eos> Of course.<eos> And that girl? Is she in the hospital here?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Intensive care?
So... what's on your mind tonight?<eos> I mean, you know I'm gonna tell you what's on mine.<eos> We're sinking down deep in the mud. Act now!<eos> Friends, we all live in the mud.<eos> In the shit!
Tina.<eos> Let me call her now, okay?<eos> I know, I'll tell her I'm alone, but... let's see if she knows anything.<eos> If her husband's there, she won't be able to talk, but... let's see.<eos> Okay?
That's a huge fucking mistake!<eos> What?<eos> - A dollar? - Oh, go for it.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Okay. Sure.
Bushnell, please help me.<eos> I only want to make things right again.<eos> And these two cops that Dougie found? Wha...<eos> He knows about them, too?<eos> Them, too.
We need to get her down the mountain.<eos> She's very important, and there are people that want her dead.<eos> She's fine physically.<eos> We need to put her in a cell where she'll be safe.<eos> Okay.
- Now?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You could just leave the cart outside.<eos> Coffee?<eos> At this hour?
At first, I thought Wren was putting me on.<eos> But then he pulled out his phone showed me your picture.<eos> I still don't know why, but I started to cry.<eos> He just ran into you?<eos> At a bar?
We got Australia over there, Croatia, Belgium...<eos> Okay, that'll do.<eos> Bite-size chunks, hmm?<eos> Let's knock this on the head.<eos> All right.
- Ray.<eos> - Glen.<eos> Grab a seat, boys.<eos> I'm calling myself Richard now, Pat, if you don't mind.<eos> Okay, fine...
And so, if you wanna go on pretending you can win, you're really left with no option but to try to convince the country you've invaded that you're actually here to help.<eos> He's saying the Americans are urinating in the streets, and they call us motherfuckers all day.<eos> It's motherfucker motherfucker all the time.<eos> And it's considered in our culture a very bad thing to fuck your own mother.<eos> In ours, too... in ours, too.
Where you coming from?<eos> Where are we from in the States, or where have we just been?<eos> Where have you just been?<eos> Italy, sir, on RR.<eos> RR in Italy.
The polling station, the one right there over where you are... 367 registered voters, 1,200 votes counted.<eos> It's a joke.<eos> We're going to a runoff election.<eos> Tell them what you told me!<eos> - About what, sir?
It's a joke.<eos> We're going to a runoff election.<eos> Tell them what you told me!<eos> - About what, sir?<eos> - About the elections.
We got tonight free, right?<eos> Then what's the plan?<eos> We're drinking. Tell me we're fucking drinking.<eos> Today is Jeanie and my's 30th wedding anniversary, so... I'm taking her to dinner.<eos> Just the two of you?
If we don't go in tonight, likely have to wait maybe another week.<eos> I want Karzai to sign off on this.<eos> Cory, can you get him on the phone?<eos> Copy.<eos> And why these spots?
Fucking move! Move!<eos> Move!<eos> To the right!<eos> - Clear!<eos> - All right!
- I know, right?<eos> - Madeline, hello!<eos> - Yes, of course. You guys go play.<eos> - Hi. - How are you?<eos> Pregnant again?
My superpower... I actually get it from Mom.<eos> No.<eos> You don't believe me?<eos> What did we have for dinner tonight with the... with the steak?<eos> Um, Mom's spinach salad?
Yes, I will.<eos> God. I hope I didn't wake you up.<eos> I'm sorry. I was just so hungry.<eos> You ever wake up in the middle of the night, and you just need to eat something?<eos> My God, all the time, especially in my second trimester.
- Yeah. And where did you say you met Celeste?<eos> At the sports event.<eos> - The polo match.<eos> - Yes, exactly.<eos> - The one back in April.
- The one back in April.<eos> - Yeah, that's the one. She never went to a polo match back in April.<eos> - May? - No. - June?<eos> - No. - August? - No.<eos> - No, no.
- May? - No. - June?<eos> - No. - August? - No.<eos> - No, no.<eos> - March.<eos> - No. - April.
Are you threatening me?<eos> No, but, actually, I feel like you're starting to threaten me, which I don't think you want to go there.<eos> You know, this thing with that Ziggy kid, all the talk of bullying?<eos> I was bullied.<eos> Sixth grade.
Looks painful enough.<eos> You know we never did have that second date.<eos> Still thinking about how to prove the Riemann Hypothesis?<eos> I'm thinking about a dead kid I met in Canaan.<eos> Dead?
I was wrong about him.<eos> Well, no, I was right about him.<eos> Actually, I was wrong about him but I was right about the wrong thing.<eos> Who are we talking about here?<eos> Parrish.
Who are we talking about here?<eos> Parrish.<eos> Remember how I thought that the Ghost Riders<eos> - were scared of him?<eos> - At the party?
You risked your life to bring us his keys.<eos> I risked my life to escape the Hunt.<eos> Not to reunite sentimental teenagers.<eos> You wanted us to know about Stiles.<eos> And Canaan.
You ready?<eos> Wait, are you kidding?<eos> Us against five Ghost Riders?<eos> - We can take 'em.<eos> - Five of them?
LIAM:<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Just, just thought I was somewhere else for a second.<eos> Where?<eos> In a bad dream.
Stiles is out there.<eos> I can feel it.<eos> Then what are we doing standing here?<eos> This is happening everywhere?<eos> Here, the school lacrosse field.
Nope.<eos> Why not?<eos> Because I knew I was gonna see you this morning.<eos> - You see me every morning.<eos> - Yeah, for now.
The latest in cloud-based security tech.<eos> Our upgraded encryption software.<eos> And an all-new team of military-trained security specialists on call 24 hours a day.<eos> So, you guys are back up and running?<eos> - 100%.
What street did you grow up on?<eos> Wallace Road.<eos> Stop it!<eos> You did not.<eos> In Tucson?
Wallace Road.<eos> Stop it!<eos> You did not.<eos> In Tucson?<eos> No, in Mumbai.
You don't want to slip and get pregnant.<eos> This will all make perfect sense once I explain it to you.<eos> Will it?<eos> No.<eos> Not at all.
You're the client.<eos> But those three lieutenants of yours. That you thought were trying to kill you...<eos> They're dead, Shot in the head just like jamison.<eos> She stays.<eos> But outside, in the hall.
Jesse's always first on the scene.<eos> Same goes for fashion trends, all the latest high-tech toys.<eos> He's obsessed with anything new, limited, or exclusive.<eos> - So we'll bait him.<eos> - With a dinner party.
Including you, apparently.<eos> Yeah, um, she's kind of my mom.<eos> So... can we come?<eos> If your mother really is the consul general, tell her dinner's at 8:00.<eos> All right. Cool.
I'll need to find replacements.<eos> If you're looking for a career change...<eos> Magic!<eos> That I banned from Oz.<eos> Here in Emerald City!
Just lead on, Captain.<eos> You burnt our homes!<eos> You burnt our children!<eos> All right, it's all right!<eos> Okay.
Full circle.<eos> Here.<eos> Your new world awaits.<eos> I knew it was you.<eos> In the water.
Magic.<eos> I believe we were mislead.<eos> The magic we put our faith in, it didn't make us stronger.<eos> We were left to rely on others.<eos> On Witches.
Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> This is lead.<eos> Lead.<eos> Okay.
Don't go.<eos> You can't go.<eos> What am I supposed to do without you?<eos> The pain... it never stopped.<eos> Maybe on the other side... No.
I can feel it when I look at her.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I didn't mean to be a bummer.<eos> It just triggered<eos> - some of my stuff.
From the CHP.<eos> Aren't you supposed to change out of it after you get off work?<eos> Yeah, you can. Most guys probably...<eos> It was my first day, so I thought you'd probably want to see what I look like.<eos> In all brown?
Are you crazy?<eos> That girl's an eight!<eos> You think she's an eight?<eos> How are you judging them?<eos> By their hair?
You think she's an eight?<eos> How are you judging them?<eos> By their hair?<eos> How straight their teeth are?<eos> Their skin?
Well, they can't light fires for fear of smoke.<eos> There'll be no leaves left, so no cover.<eos> Spotter planes will have it easy.<eos> I think that'll be it for the Resistance.<eos> Except maybe in the north, in the unoccupied zone.
In that case, I will hold you personally responsible if a copy falls into the wrong hands.<eos> I had a feeling you'd say something like that.<eos> Captain Hesse must not be included in any reports to your authorities, or the King has no chance of freedom.<eos> Well, Archer?<eos> Very well.
He plays the game well, does Garin.<eos> Smooth as silk and twice as slippery.<eos> But he sure knows how to throw a party.<eos> Takes me back to my days in high school.<eos> In the Midwest?
We need nothing of you. Except loyalty to your country.<eos> We're at the knife's edge.<eos> What about this fellow Huth?<eos> Could he be of value to us?<eos> In what venture?
And you punch me.<eos> My wife died here!<eos> They were the ones who chose to put the body here.<eos> - When did they find him?<eos> - 22:47 hours.
_ _<eos> It didn't take Kellermann long to seize his moment.<eos> Firing squads everywhere.<eos> 13 men shot in Swanage.<eos> 27 in East Lulworth.
Well then, with men like that, how did you ever lose the war?<eos> Perhaps we didn't. Just the battle.<eos> Does your son want to be a policeman?<eos> Yes. Yes, he does.<eos> But on a motorcycle.
You're dead in this town,<eos> As is your fucking puppet show.<eos> Oh, thank you so much for calling, renata.<eos> I really appreciate it.<eos> All good?
Why does fucking shit keep happening to me?<eos> oh, that's cute.<eos> Abigail. Send that to me.<eos> Hey. How's things?<eos> Um, pretty good.
I don't want you doing this.<eos> Well, it's not your fucking call.<eos> Mom?<eos> Okay, let's go, sweetie.<eos> Hey, champ.
Okay.<eos> I'm not afraid.<eos> The week leading up to Trivia Night, something changed with Celeste.<eos> Still beautiful.<eos> - But in her face...
I'm not afraid.<eos> The week leading up to Trivia Night, something changed with Celeste.<eos> Still beautiful.<eos> - But in her face...<eos> - Her eyes...
What was that about?<eos> That cute guy sitting right next to us... It turns out he's a total head case.<eos> And he was telling me about a movie that's supposed to kill you.<eos> What movie?<eos> Some video.
Excuse me, sir!<eos> Could you tell me a little bit more about the church?<eos> When did it close?<eos> Been 13 years.<eos> After the flood.
Just like a really good-looking mirage.<eos> Things are finally getting interesting for you.<eos> And I'm leaving.<eos> What are you guys talking about?<eos> Nothing.
Don't do this, Maddy.<eos> Ellipses.<eos> Look, my life is better with you in it.<eos> You know, I lied before.<eos> About what?
Now we have reprogrammed reality.<eos> Language is a virus.<eos> Religion, an operating system, and prayers are just so much fucking spam.<eos> Okay, w-well, y-you're saying all this like I'm supposed to know what the fuck you're talking about.<eos> The dominant fucking paradigm, Shadow.
- Stop, you're scaring me right now.<eos> - Are you in on it?<eos> - In on what?<eos> - Are you in on it?<eos> - In on what?
So what do your parents do, Chris?<eos> Uh...<eos> My dad wasn't really in the picture. My mom passed away when I was 11.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry. How did she die?<eos> A hit and run.
First wire ever sent by Samuel F.B. Morse himself in 1844,<eos> "What hath God wrought?"<eos> Goddamn information age is what.<eos> Best thing about these states we're headed towards-- Minnesota, Wisconsin-- is that they have the kind of women that I loved when I was younger.<eos> Pale-skinned, blue-eyed.
- Please.<eos> I can't bear another PB and J for lunch.<eos> You guys make me the banker for a reason.<eos> - It's called making rent.<eos> - Fine.
You got a suit on.<eos> Put on some good weight.<eos> You fitting in okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay.
- Come on! Hustle!<eos> - Let's go!<eos> - Okay!<eos> Good. Good.<eos> You good?
What does it even fucking matter?<eos> First tremor, I'm putting a bullet in my head.<eos> When's the pain the worst?<eos> The morning.<eos> And at night.
So, I wish everybody here a wonderful afternoon.<eos> Don't work too hard.<eos> Nice. Nice.<eos> Nice! Oooh.<eos> All right.
Nice! Oooh.<eos> All right.<eos> Loose, loose, loose.<eos> When you come in, jab step, right hand.<eos> All right?
Have a drink with me.<eos> Come on.<eos> She go down okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Finally.
She'll stop.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Hi.<eos> Where the fuck have you been?<eos> At work.
This is not your home.<eos> Please leave.<eos> No.<eos> I want you to leave.<eos> Okay.
I don't have a preference.<eos> That's fine.<eos> Natural?<eos> Sure.<eos> Uh, ten o'clock, latest.
- You ready? - Mm-hmm.<eos> - You sure?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> In no particular order...
They did, indeed.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Okay.<eos> So... Where do you want me?<eos> The bed?
Don't worry. Deletes in 10 seconds.<eos> He'll never know.<eos> I'm out of here.<eos> Honey, I'll see you at home.<eos> - All right.
Oh, my gosh, your lasagna!<eos> - I'm so excited! - Ah! - Ah!<eos> Our girls are home!<eos> - Whoo! - Let's eat!<eos> John: All right.
I stand like this before lunch 'cause I read that it boosts your testosterone and helps you speak more confidently.<eos> I have no idea why they gave me this job.<eos> They gave you the job because you are incredible at getting people to do what you want... including writing very large checks.<eos> I'm feeling in over my head, John, and I need your support.<eos> - All right? - Yeah.
My last relationship ended horribly and I... I wanted something simple.<eos> You and I have a connection and you know that.<eos> Please don't make this harder than it has to be.<eos> Fine.<eos> Okay.
Flashes. A little boy.<eos> Me, maybe, or my brother.<eos> I felt stranded...<eos> Stranded where?<eos> This empty beach.
Tell everyone where I found you.<eos> Thomas.<eos> It's okay.<eos> This is a safe place.<eos> In the woods.
What was your son's name?<eos> Oliver.<eos> I was dreaming.<eos> When he was in the water, I was dreaming.<eos> What about?
He's gonna call before we get in the cab.<eos> - Okay. - Come on, man.<eos> - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. - [phone rings]<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay.
God damn it.<eos> I almost had him when I told him Affleck was playing, but... he's such a starfucker.<eos> So you're rested and rejuvenated?<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> All right.
And you and Grandpa and Carly.<eos> I'm just trying to keep this sinking ship afloat.<eos> And admit it. If it had worked, you'd have been thrilled.<eos> But it didn't work, did it?<eos> At least not yet.
He builds what he calls memory palaces in his head.<eos> Memory palaces?<eos> What the fuck is that?<eos> Sounds, uh, fancy.<eos> All right.
As long as you remember I started here three weeks before you, so I have seniority, which is why I'm training you.<eos> Which is insane if you think about it, because I just moved here two months ago and I have no idea what I'm doing.<eos> I think it's going well.<eos> Do you like it? Here?<eos> At the Crestmont?
Don't be jealous, Clay.<eos> You'll fill out. Someday.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Is your dad also thin and nervous?<eos> Yeah, pretty much.
You'll fill out. Someday.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Is your dad also thin and nervous?<eos> Yeah, pretty much.<eos> - Hey, Helmet. - Hey.
Okay, I can call you back.<eos> No! I...<eos> I mean, uh, what problem were you having trouble with?<eos> The one about the, uh... trains?<eos> The trains?
Train "B" is leaving your house...<eos> In 30 minutes.<eos> Thirty minutes seems like an awfully long time for two trains going full speed, huh?<eos> Eisenhower Park.<eos> Rocket slide.
- Fuck off.<eos> Third?<eos> Okay, assholes.<eos> A picture's worth a thousand words.<eos> Public space.
Trust me.<eos> Worse than Hannah being dead?<eos> I'll see you around, Clay.<eos> Am I side two?<eos> Hey, Helmet.
I thought she had some good ideas.<eos> Have you ever in your life been able to confront an issue head-on?<eos> Have you ever even had an issue?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Kind of. Or...
Remember, it's formal, so no exposed midriffs.<eos> - Got it.<eos> - And I hope you'll save a dance for me.<eos> Sure. I don't actually dance.<eos> Hey, Helmet!
Hence... you.<eos> Yes, me.<eos> Gary, I'd like to start with a conversation, nothing more.<eos> Just about Liberty.<eos> The climate here, the challenges.
I mean, we were in this together... weren't we?<eos> Hey. That seat's taken.<eos> Yeah, by me.<eos> Talk to me.<eos> About what?
- No. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> Is this happening again? You're back together?<eos> Not unless this is the Hell Freezes Over dance.<eos> Sad thing is, that'd be a really good theme.<eos> Later.
I wonder if you want to dance.<eos> I would love to dance.<eos> Awesome. Okay. Cool.<eos> I don't think this is a song you can dance to.<eos> Like, with someone.
I'm not sure why you brought me here.<eos> Because you've been acting like Hannah killing herself was some, like, school activity.<eos> Like just a reason to put posters up.<eos> I'm trying to help the school heal.<eos> The school?
Which is exactly what we don't need right now.<eos> Well, Alex started it, but ended up getting hurt pretty bad.<eos> This was in front of the library?<eos> This was down in the street, by the tennis courts.<eos> But in the street?
Never mind, let's just keep going.<eos> Hey, Sheri... what would you think about going somewhere else to work?<eos> Uh, okay, sure.<eos> You live near here, right?<eos> Yeah, kind of.
You were thinking of Hannah.<eos> I wasn't.<eos> That's okay.<eos> I wasn't... I wasn't thinking of anyone.<eos> But... but you.
You're finally gonna get what you deserve.<eos> It's about time.<eos> What?<eos> I said let me know if you need to talk.<eos> Any time.
Just like Kat said, once upon a time.<eos> So sweet.<eos> Well, welcome to your tape, Zach.<eos> For those who aren't Zach, you can relax.<eos> For now, at least.
Until this year.<eos> Have you ever seen a dead body?<eos> I've been to a few funerals.<eos> Have you ever seen a crime scene?<eos> CSI and Law Order, all that.
Have you ever seen a dead body?<eos> I've been to a few funerals.<eos> Have you ever seen a crime scene?<eos> CSI and Law Order, all that.<eos> Like a... a real one.
Well, that's very...<eos> 'Cause people need to take responsibility for their actions... and face the consequences, one way or another.<eos> Thank you, Clay.<eos> Uh, so, let's get to the rest of these results. (CLEARS THROAT)<eos> HANNAH: Hey, Helmet.
It isn't, we're not, and I want people to know it.<eos> It was our one piece of leverage, Andy!<eos> You showed him our hand!<eos> Hannah was crying out for help right under their noses.<eos> And under ours, too.
I hope you called their parents and notified the proper authorities.<eos> Oh, definitely.<eos> No fun on my watch.<eos> Fun?<eos> At a party?
Can we do this after third period?<eos> We can't do this after third.<eos> Hey, guys, do what?<eos> If Justin doesn't want to find out, I should show someone else.<eos> Yeah, okay.
You don't have to... leave or anything.<eos> It takes a tragedy like this one, unfortunately, to remind us how important it is to be safe... to be sober... and never drink and drive.<eos> Clay?<eos> Can we talk?<eos> About what?
- Hannah... - Sheri, Jeff is...<eos> You two okay?<eos> Yeah, we're okay, Mr. Porter.<eos> I mean, considering what happened.<eos> All right.
That's fucked up.<eos> This school is fucked up.<eos> Don't disagree.<eos> So, are we gonna smoke or what?<eos> In the parking lot?
The party hasn't started.<eos> No one's going to be here for another hour.<eos> But I thought... I heard it started at seven?<eos> Yeah. And, A, it's 6:55, and, B, seven really means nine.<eos> Oh, right.
I would make... everyone else disappear.<eos> And then what would we do?<eos> Well... we would...<eos> - Did he get you?<eos> - Mostly dry.
At that moment... everything was perfect.<eos> And for the first time in a long time... I could imagine a future where I was happy.<eos> How good life could be.<eos> And I know you felt it too.<eos> This okay? Yeah.
- Love you. - Love you, too.<eos> - I'm going.<eos> Love you!<eos> Bye.<eos> Um, hey, Helmet.
Empty?<eos> Yeah, I don't feel anything.<eos> Like... I don't care anymore.<eos> You don't care about what?<eos> About anything.
Just help me out here. Please.<eos> When you leave this office... how would you like things to be different for Hannah?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm not sure what I'm expecting.<eos> All right.
"Best of, worst of" thing.<eos> And people have been reacting to it ever since.<eos> When was the last time?<eos> A week ago.<eos> At a party.
Well, I hope that it goes without saying that you'll be very sorely missed.<eos> No, in all seriousness, I've loved every single minute of it.<eos> Well, you were always a natural, Tess.<eos> I suspect it's gonna be early next year.<eos> Probably April.
This is Rick Grimes, the leader of Alexandria, and these are some of his people.<eos> I welcome you all to the Kingdom, good travelers.<eos> Now, what brings you to our fair land?<eos> Why do you seek an audience with the King?<eos> Ezekiel...
What the hell do you think this is?<eos> Do you have canned pasta and tomato sauce?<eos> You want orange-y or red?<eos> Orange-y.<eos> All right.
It's gonna work out. What -<eos> - What does that even mean, Tara?<eos> It means we've got the numbers to fight now.<eos> We just need to find some guns and -- Do you know where we could find that many guns today?<eos> This week?
- What does that even mean, Tara?<eos> It means we've got the numbers to fight now.<eos> We just need to find some guns and -- Do you know where we could find that many guns today?<eos> This week?<eos> This year?
Does Maggie know Rosita's here yet?<eos> I-I-i don't think so.<eos> I didn't...<eos> You should tell her.<eos> About all of it. No.
You know what?<eos> You suck ass, Rick. You really do.<eos> I don't want to have to kill her, but that's exactly what you're gonna make me do.<eos> Let me see her.<eos> All right.
Thank you, gentlemen.<eos> Hey, have a good day, all right?<eos> Have a good one, sir.<eos> You want this?<eos> All right.
You want this?<eos> All right.<eos> Want this?<eos> No?<eos> Okay.
And I know for a fact the UFC will not make an offer unless he wins tonight, so you have no leverage.<eos> Well, you can bid with everyone else after the fight, including the UFC.<eos> You trust me?<eos> - Sure.<eos> - Okay.
Early 20's, which I'm not, obviously.<eos> MMaybe we should just use the one where my hair is back.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'll get new pictures.<eos> Okay.
Did she eat anything?<eos> I gave her a bottle, yeah.<eos> You all good?<eos> - Yes. Go.<eos> - All right.
Well, you got to toughen up.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Okay. - Yeah.<eos> You got a daughter watching you now, Kulina.<eos> All right!
Stop!<eos> Aah! Fuck you, guy.<eos> Fuck!<eos> Get these gloves off me.<eos> You good?
Coach of the Year... not too shabby.<eos> You seem down.<eos> I'm not down.<eos> Well, you're not up.<eos> About what?
Keith, don't be fucking paranoid, man.<eos> You're making yourself crazy.<eos> Will you just relax?<eos> Try to relax.<eos> All right.
It's a key.<eos> It unlocks doors.<eos> Relax.<eos> It's just easier for nights that you want to be here.<eos> Okay.
I am gonna go say good evening to our girl.<eos> She's asleep.<eos> I'll be home early.<eos> - No rush.<eos> - Okay.
All right.<eos> Let me see you stand up.<eos> Right here.<eos> Let me see your eyes. Let me see your eyes.<eos> - You good?
Intentionally kneeing the head of a grounded opponent!<eos> Take your time! Take your time!<eos> All right, you ready to go?<eos> Yes?<eos> Okay.
I'm on your side, Nate.<eos> I'm not trying to get in your business.<eos> Beer?<eos> Actually, I'm gonna go.<eos> Okay.
And then, for some reason, I thought of a bunch of Smurfs carrying a cantaloupe.<eos> Except they weren't blue, so I have no idea what that means.<eos> When the mind is still, we can think of some pretty funny things.<eos> Uh, what color were they?<eos> All different colors.
Yeah, but they got all this shit now that they don't even know how to test for.<eos> Mac, I just want to...<eos> I just want to keep what I got here, pal.<eos> Come in.<eos> Hey, Mac. Okay.
- East Coast. Kenny from Black House said that he wanted him, but he didn't have the room.<eos> Oh, you're killing me with these fucking meetings.<eos> - Three more... after this one.<eos> - He's here?<eos> - Mm-hmm. In my office.
Jesus Christ.<eos> Did you push your way into the house?<eos> I spoke to him in his front door...<eos> - But were you...<eos> - in his jamb on the door.
I got a black belt in BJJ, so I can help you out there, too, so...<eos> I got Joe Daddy for that.<eos> Uh, you know, basically I need somebody to hold pads,<eos> - move around with these guys.<eos> - All right.
All right.<eos> Well, listen.<eos> I can take on as much or as little as you need.<eos> - Whatever lightens your load, I got it.<eos> - Okay. All right.
Yeah, that's great. That's great.<eos> I, uh... Well, that's it.<eos> I mean, you have any other questions, you call Lisa.<eos> Uh, I think we're seeing a couple more people, but, you know, we'll let you know<eos> - next day or so.
I mean, you have any other questions, you call Lisa.<eos> Uh, I think we're seeing a couple more people, but, you know, we'll let you know<eos> - next day or so.<eos> - Cool.<eos> - All right?
- Shut up.<eos> - Put a fucking suit on.<eos> - Shut the fuck up.<eos> Never bang on this fucking door at night again.<eos> Okay.
I'm just telling you.<eos> Alvey's gonna find out.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay? Okay.
I'm gonna go home.<eos> Yeah?<eos> So early?<eos> I'm tired.<eos> All right.
I'll... I'll see you tomorrow, all right?<eos> I think I'm actually gonna take a couple days off.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But I'll, uh... I'll see you at the baptism.<eos> What baptism?
Who's... Who going?<eos> Uh, Mom, Ryan, Lisa.<eos> Lisa?<eos> Hmm. Never said a word to me.<eos> Okay.
We'll figure it out.<eos> All right. Leave it. Leave it.<eos> Leave it. You okay to drive?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - All right.
I have two things in my possession.<eos> Both belong to you.<eos> Would you like to know what they are?<eos> - Yes, I would.<eos> - All right.
Are you willing to walk away?<eos> No. No, no, no.<eos> Just... Just do the best you can, all right?<eos> Stand by.<eos> All right.
Now will you please go?<eos> I'm going.<eos> You got this?<eos> Yeah.<eos> All right.
Fuck that.<eos> She was fine last night.<eos> Fuck you.<eos> How you feeling, love?<eos> Okay.
Exwife.<eos> Horrible woman, good lawyer.<eos> You know?<eos> I don't fuck around with the IRS.<eos> Yeah, all right.
There's no meltdown here.<eos> Good.<eos> Good?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay.
You don't have to do that.<eos> Nah, it's all good.<eos> It's meditative.<eos> Helps me with my OCD, you know?<eos> Okay.
No.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> What am I talking about?<eos> You didn't see the fucking gigantic stand<eos> - right by the door right there?
- Where the fuck is he?<eos> - He doesn't have class until tonight.<eos> You better take care of this fucking guy.<eos> I'm telling you, I got him up to here.<eos> Okay.
Am I... am I... am I missing something?<eos> - God, please, stop talking. No. - No, all I'm saying...<eos> Am I missing something here?<eos> I mean, weren't... weren't we just fucking in the...<eos> - in the parking lot?
I don't fuck... I don't fucking hear him breathing at all right now, dude.<eos> What do I do? ...yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay. Okay.<eos> Okay. Okay. Okay.
But I'll tell you something.<eos> I won more of those fights than I lost.<eos> Made me a man.<eos> I was too afraid to tell my mother, but it made me a man.<eos> All right?
Yeah, she... We had a kid.<eos> But they... no longer live here.<eos> Maya.<eos> No, she's with her mom and her family.<eos> Wisconsin, yeah.
He came over as a friend, and I appreciated that.<eos> Alvey's got friends.<eos> I've got friends.<eos> - It's not an issue.<eos> - Okay.
- Here.<eos> - Fucking life, Mac.<eos> Come here.<eos> Take it.<eos> Before Amy?
That's a fucking gesture, Mac.<eos> That's a fucking man standing up on his own two fucking feet for his woman.<eos> You understand?<eos> Yeah.<eos> All right, all right.
It's adorable.<eos> You're gonna get the hang of it.<eos> Just... just do one show tonight and then watch a movie.<eos> I'll be home around 11:00.<eos> - Okay.
A different kind of Rick, I guess.<eos> Well, we'll see how long that lasts.<eos> I heard sci-fi noises.<eos> Did you make a breakthrough?<eos> Sort of.
Don't say that.<eos> I'm sorry I just...<eos> She's real sweet, Nikki. We're in, you know...<eos> You meet her at work?<eos> At work yeah.
A little robbing, not wholesale burglary, just a specific...<eos> Just looking for a certain item.<eos> And if you do it, well let's just say your little problem goes up in smoke.<eos> What are we talking about?<eos> A stamp.
Just looking for a certain item.<eos> And if you do it, well let's just say your little problem goes up in smoke.<eos> What are we talking about?<eos> A stamp.<eos> A stamp?
Drinks scotch.<eos> Lots of it.<eos> What do you know about him?<eos> Talks a lot.<eos> - What about?
Is Rune doing heroin?<eos> - No.<eos> - Don't lie to me!<eos> Hit me again and I will fucking garrote you.<eos> Okay. Okay.
Hey what's going on?<eos> What's happening?<eos> There's a bear.<eos> Where... the playground? No.<eos> Inside.
What's happening?<eos> There's a bear.<eos> Where... the playground? No.<eos> Inside.<eos> Inside?
Look, for what it's worth, I'm sorry.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Have you told him?<eos> You should probably mention it.<eos> At some point.
I think he was watching us.<eos> Err, it's just probably routine.<eos> I bet you anything they watch all the unemployed governors and bankrupt trawlermen that pass through.<eos> You were always good at that.<eos> - What?
You brought me here.<eos> Brought you?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Just now.<eos> In your dream.
Can't sit still and let him hold us hostage.<eos> Can't fight him directly or we risk losing what few soldiers we have left.<eos> And even if I could slip a ship past him to seek aid from your family in the colonies, you'd have to be on that ship. And you'd never get that far before he caught you.<eos> I won't risk that.<eos> All right.
But now I'm here... and things are about to begin again.<eos> You?<eos> Who are you that I ought to pay you any mind?<eos> I'm no one.<eos> From nowhere.
I can't really make sense of it.<eos> I think maybe... sometimes I'm just holding on to this idea of perfection so tight... something has to give.<eos> And I can't explain it. And I won't excuse it.<eos> I've been wanting to tell Ed for so long. I just haven't found the courage.<eos> Yet.
- Go get 'em, guy.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> It's fine.<eos> I need you to take the boys now to this address that I'm gonna give you.<eos> Um, it... yes, right now.
We leave once that is done or not at all.<eos> Take Nassau?<eos> With what army?<eos> Whatever slaves are still alive on this island will never fight alongside a pirate again.<eos> - Not after last night.
You watching porn?<eos> What?<eos> Oh, when people are watching porn, they shut...<eos> Ah, never mind. Forget it.<eos> Okay.
So, what do you wanna know?<eos> Why did he do it on my birthday?<eos> I'm sorry to interrupt.<eos> I'm gonna grab something upstairs.<eos> - No problem.
I'm gonna grab something upstairs.<eos> - No problem.<eos> I'll see you later, Kev.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> All right.
So, that's what he did.<eos> - He escaped.<eos> - And that's what he did.<eos> - He escaped.<eos> - Okay.
Jeez, now I know why I quit therapy.<eos> What brings you by, Kev-o?<eos> We got a problem.<eos> We gotta keep it between you and me.<eos> Okay.
What do I know?<eos> - You still got your crown on.<eos> - I know I do.<eos> What were guys talking about out on the porch?<eos> Your penises?
How's Stella?<eos> Yeah, she's good.<eos> You think I was too hard on him?<eos> Irv?<eos> Ray. At the anniversary party.
Right. We should talk to Stan Grossman about that.<eos> Test the waters. Yeah.<eos> I'll make a note.<eos> Anyway, it seems there's a big rig parked there now.<eos> - In the lot?
Remember how I said we were expanding our IT department?<eos> No.<eos> Well, we are. So...<eos> Sorry, I was dealin' with the... What?<eos> Your...
Your...<eos> Did I tell you what I like about this place, Minnesota?<eos> It's so perfectly, sublimely bland.<eos> Have you been to the Danube?<eos> Or Gansu?
The inescapable reality.<eos> You're trapped.<eos> Don't look so sad.<eos> By the time we're done, you'll be billionaires.<eos> On paper, at least.
But, uh...<eos> I live in a small town.<eos> You gotta be on Facebook, though. You know, 'cause it's like a small town.<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> Only online.
- Watch him.<eos> I can help!<eos> I'm looking for information on a writer.<eos> He would've worked here in the '70s. - Union?<eos> - Uh, pardon?
But now your service is complete.<eos> It is time to shut yourself down.<eos> I can help!<eos> Arby's?<eos> Okay.
LeFay. Some kinda freak accident.<eos> Air conditioner fell on him, just...<eos> Like a pancake.<eos> And him on parole for some pretty nasty stuff, too.<eos> Not in front of the boy.
_<eos> _<eos> There is a police station in Eden Valley with no computers.<eos> I'd like to take a look at a case file.<eos> One or two?
Sorry, babe.<eos> We should get off the street.<eos> I know a motel where they take cash.<eos> Good boy.<eos> - All right?
Afraid you'd leave fingerprints?<eos> Where else might we find your fingerprints?<eos> Uh, I came in that door.<eos> So, the knob, inside and out.<eos> That frame, the glass.
Which is it, a meeting or a dinner?<eos> Uh, dinner.<eos> With whom?<eos> - Sy.<eos> - Which restaurant?
When Rabbi Nachman first visited Uman, he saw the mass grave, and he called it... a garden.<eos> He told his followers that he wanted to be buried there. The master of the field.<eos> His soul, he said, would bind and comfort theirs.<eos> Have you been to this place before?<eos> The bowling alley?
How many partners do you have?<eos> Just how much time...<eos> Like I said, this is just a baby step.<eos> I'll park myself in an office, you know, do a few interviews, maybe look over your books.<eos> An office? Exactly.
They will do right by your body and bury you as is proper.<eos> They will be sad for a time, then they will find happiness again.<eos> Your Assaf will marry in a year and name his first daughter for you.<eos> A bullshit middle name?<eos> A bullshit middle name.
Like I'm worried about marshmallows.<eos> Yeah, I like marshmallows. What we need is snow.<eos> Hard, driving, irritating snow.<eos> I want you to think "snow." Think "snow." Think "snow."<eos> - Snow? - Snow.
Stockton.<eos> What's in Stockton?<eos> Hey. How you making out?<eos> I'm up $7.<eos> All right.
Well, maybe it's like jumping into cold water.<eos> I mean, you're never ready, but once you get in, you get used to it and you're glad you did it.<eos> I'm not talking about us.<eos> Fine, let's talk about you.<eos> Not that either.
From oil that you steal from people.<eos> Or whatever the fucking metaphor is.<eos> I just want to know, how do people benefit from it?<eos> With enough data and enough analysis, there are no more Silk Roads.<eos> Not on the web, not on our city streets.
Ring a bell?<eos> Yeah?<eos> You're kidding me.<eos> Nah, I'll be right there.<eos> Okay.
- Isadora Williams.<eos> - Ahhh, man.<eos> Sounds like you thinkin' with the wrong head, man.<eos> Come on, Jackie, you know I'm smarter than that.<eos> Sure, okay.
Who was the officer that took your phone?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Uh... a Mexican with a mustache.<eos> Okay, what park was it?<eos> Guadalupe.
Citizen filed a complaint this morning.<eos> Pretty serious.<eos> It says a cop confiscated her phone unlawfully, and never returned it.<eos> She describes a Mexican male with a mustache, and you were the only officer on the scene that fits that description.<eos> Yeah, what scene?
Okay?<eos> Oh, what does that mean?<eos> Is it good?<eos> Good, we'll see you then.<eos> Bye-bye.
Can we play the video for her?<eos> I can ask.<eos> Good job today.<eos> - Bye.<eos> - All right.
I'm sorry.<eos> Okay?<eos> I don't mean to step on other people.<eos> But if I can't get you to figure out what's wrong with me, I end up in an asylum.<eos> Or prison.
Permiso.<eos> Señora, do you know somebody who can help us translate it?<eos> If it can be done, it has to be done in the spirit.<eos> You understand?<eos> In church.
Don't forget to teach them staying alive.<eos> It's harder than killing, although sometimes, the two go together.<eos> What a fine companion, Master Lluís.<eos> - Where can I put her?<eos> - Under shelter.
My wife's right.<eos> I'm ashamed to ask you this, but... being as she seems to like you, maybe you could ask her for us.<eos> Well, she only lent me the horse.<eos> She never let anyone else ride it.<eos> All right.
That's enough!<eos> He's alive. And doing as he pleases.<eos> - You've seen him?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Where?
He's alive. And doing as he pleases.<eos> - You've seen him?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Where?<eos> - On the other side. Prisoner?
Fuck you.<eos> Needs to be fucking babysat.<eos> Not part of my job description.<eos> Is there a problem?<eos> Yeah, matter of fact.
- No, I don't.<eos> - Seriously?<eos> - Seriously.<eos> You locked me in the safe.<eos> The office safe?
Well, you know, just so that, next time there's a school trip, you won't miss it.<eos> You don't have to do that.<eos> I know I don't have to. I want to.<eos> Here. Take it.<eos> Thanks, Cuz.
Your pal, semi?<eos> You're upset about that, right?<eos> I had nothing against him.<eos> I thought he was a decent guy.<eos> - Decent guy? - Yeah.
(Chuckles) I know it's bullshit, but... (Sighs) She's right there.<eos> She takes my hand. She tells me,<eos> "you belong with me."<eos> I'm pretty sure I don't belong here.<eos> This ship.
We have intel from our partners that the Iranians are cheating on the nuclear deal.<eos> There's an Iranian bag man, Farhad Nafisi.<eos> The Israelis are gonna pick him up.<eos> Dar told me they have evidence of a parallel program<eos> - with North Korea.
She's the defendant's sister.<eos> Not a credible witness either.<eos> This isn't the arrangement we made, Carrie.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - Our partnership.
Simone, do you know where he is?<eos> No.<eos> But I do know him.<eos> She was seeing him on the side.<eos> All very secret.
Quinn.<eos> Quinn, Quinn, Quinn. You're gonna be okay.<eos> You're gonna be okay. Help is coming.<eos> Your Honor, the complaint makes no mention of<eos> - a confidential human source.
That this big threat to national security was just another Muslim kid you entrapped.<eos> Entrapped?<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> How do you think we found this shithead?<eos> Randomly? In a phone book?
Well, what do you suggest?<eos> You recommend somebody absolutely trustworthy to represent US interests on the ground there.<eos> Like you, for example? No.<eos> No.<eos> God, no. Uh...
Yeah. Sure.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm trying.<eos> Call me if you need anything.<eos> Anytime.
No, I-I didn't want to.<eos> Of course.<eos> But I do now.<eos> It was in Berlin.<eos> In a barracks in Dahlem.
It's meant to shock people, wake them up to what's happening in the Middle East.<eos> If somebody breaks in your home, logic dictates you do whatever it takes to get them out.<eos> You have no idea who I am, do you?<eos> I'm just some blonde lady who works with Reda.<eos> Basically.
Yeah. He fucked me over, and look at us...<eos> practically partners.<eos> - So, where are you?<eos> - In a parking lot... where I tracked down that blue Jeep, which then disappeared while I was inside a very strange place.<eos> Strange how?
My God. If anyone has a right to claim them...<eos> I can't.<eos> It's because you're ashamed of him.<eos> No.<eos> No. God, no.
Tom. Who was in the pickup, the one you drove up in?<eos> She prefers to remain anonymous.<eos> But I'm grateful to her.<eos> We had a very interesting talk.<eos> - About what?
Taken four hours before the explosion.<eos> You recognize the van?<eos> Who's that?<eos> I tracked down that blue Jeep, which then disappeared while I was inside a very strange place.<eos> Strange how?
You're just feeling the effects of the sedative the doctor gave you.<eos> What doctor?<eos> The one at the hospital.<eos> Don't let me forget. What, Peter?<eos> What?
Mm-hmm. Yes.<eos> It was a very difficult time for us as a family.<eos> He was doing what he believed was right, and I was doing what I believed was right.<eos> When was the last time you saw him?<eos> 2007, in Baghdad.
I believe they had a name for her in Kabul, didn't they, when she was Station Chief there.<eos> What was it again?<eos> "The Angel of Death"?<eos> "The Drone Queen."<eos> Yeah. And in Berlin?
Where is he?<eos> Oh, wait, wait.<eos> I'm getting closer.<eos> Uh, they're-- they're somewhere in Midtown.<eos> Um, east, maybe?
This is Maria at Child Services.<eos> You've been approved for a visit with your daughter tomorrow at our offices.<eos> Do you know where that is?<eos> I do.<eos> At 3:00 PM.
You know that.<eos> I don't.<eos> I got you out of lockup.<eos> So you knew where I was.<eos> In a safe place.
You think you know better than me.<eos> When it comes to the defense of this country, I'm certain I do.<eos> Oh, you're certain?<eos> I've been at this a very long time.<eos> At what?
If I can get to Athens-- And I think I can-- only you and Father Matsoukis know about the rectory.<eos> The rectory?<eos> Of course.<eos> And here I thought all these years that it would be our little hideaway<eos> - in the Greek islands.
Well, where do you think I got it?<eos> We just shot it-- me and Peter did.<eos> When?<eos> Just now, like, an hour ago.<eos> At Bellevue?
We just shot it-- me and Peter did.<eos> When?<eos> Just now, like, an hour ago.<eos> At Bellevue?<eos> No, honey, in Queens.
You can go right in.<eos> - Carrie.<eos> - Madam President.<eos> David and I were just speaking about you.<eos> In glowing terms.
Sorry.<eos> Fucking drop foot.<eos> At least you're up and walking.<eos> Hell of a lot better than when I saw you in May.<eos> May?
Fucking drop foot.<eos> At least you're up and walking.<eos> Hell of a lot better than when I saw you in May.<eos> May?<eos> In the hospital.
Those numbers exist because a vast majority of those posts were made by bots-- digital entities pretending to be people.<eos> Dig into those identities and you find no one-- no real names, no Social Security numbers, no addresses, no jobs, just a stream of hate.<eos> Dig deeper, you find many of these bots are run in a place called the Office of Policy Coordination, which is in a building off of I-95, with a control center six floors underground.<eos> Underground.<eos> An underground bunker?
You operated on Charlie twice.<eos> Yeah, but that's different.<eos> What I got up to at Jaxxx, it's not physically possible<eos> - to get any closer...<eos> - O-okay, yeah.
- Good night. - Yeah.<eos> Hey, beautiful.<eos> Congratulations, by the way.<eos> "The fault, Dear Brutus, is not in our stars,"<eos> "but in ourselves."
Amen.<eos> And now, Lord, we shall enter the church for the royal oath, which shall be sworn upon the corpse of the blessed Saint Cuthbert himself.<eos> Cuthbert...<eos> He is here?<eos> In his entirety.
Kevin?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Excuse me! You know where the public library is?<eos> 120/80.<eos> Optimal.
- What the fuck did you do?<eos> Okay. I just... I need you to calm down and just tell me what happened.<eos> What happened is that I went to see Evie and she told me that you fucking called her.<eos> - Where are you?<eos> - The library.
Je suis le seul espoir, la dernière défense d'une espèce au bord de I'extinction.<eos> Si une seule explosion peut casser la coquille fragile et faire fondre les démons à I'intérieur. Dieu, que ce missile vole droit et vrai. Laisse-nous trouver le nid du volcan.<eos> Reverend.<eos> I brought a casserole.<eos> Islands in the Pacific.
No, no. We're a relief mission.<eos> We're authorized.<eos> They don't care.<eos> Where can we land?<eos> Tasmania.
- Sorry.<eos> Four tickets.<eos> How long is the journey there?<eos> 11 hours.<eos> Okay, okay.
When we dock, stay on the boat.<eos> Jesus, Matt. You look terrible.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I just need to speak to Michael and John.<eos> - About what?
Tell me what to fucking do.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Tell me what to do.<eos> Hey, Pop.<eos> Hey, Lorelei.
I wanted you to be happy.<eos> I was pregnant.<eos> What?<eos> I was pregnant.<eos> 16 weeks.
We don't know each other really well.<eos> We only talked a couple times, really.<eos> There was this dance, a Christmas dance at the high school.<eos> We just had a really nice conversation.<eos> Yeah. In the hallway.
And when I saw you riding your bike, it reminded me... how I had always wished I had asked you to dance.<eos> Anyway, I know it sounds crazy, but I felt a connection.<eos> So, you know, here we are in the middle of nowhere bumping into each other, and I'm only here for the night, and I figured, you know, if I didn't ask you to dance tonight... I'll never forgive myself.<eos> You need to leave now.<eos> Okay.
You're really gonna keep this up?<eos> Keep what up?<eos> So, you and me, we only talked that one time at that Christmas dance in Mapleton.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What about the courthouse?
Everything I said about Matt's funeral.<eos> Everything I told you about Jill and Tommy... my father.<eos> Did you move back to Mapleton?<eos> No. Still in Jarden.<eos> In our house.
Go out there and put forth the word.<eos> If Billy isn't in this room within the hour, I promise him... he will regret it.<eos> You heard him.<eos> Sails!<eos> South-southwest!
- Dad. Dad.<eos> - I beg you, please. Don't throw away everything that we have worked for your whole life!<eos> I was just coming to talk to you and your father about campaign managers.<eos> You know anything, Tio?<eos> Anything about what?
You don't have to.<eos> Let me take you home.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Only thing is I don't know where you live.<eos> Arlington.
The files only exist on Simms' computer, and there might be something in there that'll lead us to Naseri and Rebecca.<eos> The only way into that dossier now is directly from Simms' station, in his office.<eos> So I need to get in front of Simms' computer, all right.<eos> Where's his office?<eos> The Pentagon.
But, honey, look!<eos> Dearest, maybe not in front of the children.<eos> But I thought it would cheer them up, the little Gloomy Guses.<eos> I had my star reporter write an article for the front page so that everyone will know your home was destroyed and you're orphans now.<eos> The front page!
Get a move on.<eos> The troupe will be here at 7:00.<eos> And in the meantime, I will be up in...<eos> Can you guess?<eos> Your secret tower room?
Last call forflight306...<eos> Hey bud, you awake in there?<eos> Funny. Funny, dad.<eos> Hey, uh... so, is gramps gonna have a open casket?<eos> Closed casket.
Acting like a little shit, huh?<eos> Yeah, dumb shit.<eos> Ok. You're ok then, huh?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Ok. Ok. Alright.
Yeah.<eos> Ok. Ok. Alright.<eos> Well, why don't we have a little pow wow before the meeting in the morning.<eos> Tomorrow.<eos> Yeah, ok.
Yeah, ok.<eos> Oh, and uh, tell Shane to fly straight or I'm gonna kick his ass.<eos> Youhearthat,Shane?<eos> Yeah,heheardit.<eos> Alright. Yeah,yougotit.
Movement on the shoreline!<eos> - Get those launches away. - Aye.<eos> - Is Flint among them?<eos> - I think so.<eos> By the dunes.
Your slaves, ma'am.<eos> I own no slaves and none work in my employ.<eos> I see cargo operations, uh, transportation of sugar, building, all sorts of manual labor.<eos> That is correct.<eos> In the Bahamas.
- Really?<eos> - Talking to other schools.<eos> We'll have him over for dinner.<eos> Once he gets a peek at your Royals stuff, it'll knock his socks off.<eos> - Hey.
What's wrong?<eos> Oh, it's my stomach.<eos> It's been a bit off today.<eos> Hey, do you have any more of that ginger root stuff?<eos> Not on me.
Oh, it's my stomach.<eos> It's been a bit off today.<eos> Hey, do you have any more of that ginger root stuff?<eos> Not on me.<eos> On the right or the left?
Well, you better tell them the rest.<eos> Uh... we are getting married... tonight.<eos> - What?<eos> - Right here.<eos> In the living room.
What's the line on Arsenal?<eos> Yeah. Okay.<eos> Put me down for the same as last time.<eos> Yeah, ten grand.<eos> - Bay.
The dogfight party, did you forget about that?<eos> Of course I didn't forget, but he quit after that, which I respected.<eos> Because I told him to!<eos> Well, can you just let me explain?<eos> Okay. Fine.
I want us to work this out.<eos> I miss you.<eos> - What can I do?<eos> - You can break up with him.<eos> Bay...
She's already at anchor.<eos> Looks like she's been waiting for us.<eos> It looks like she knew where to wait for us.<eos> Jesus Christ!<eos> On their rail!
I don't know what information you were privy to...<eos> I appreciate your concern.<eos> Come back when you like.<eos> I may be able to help you get back inside.<eos> Back on the council?
If our cause is to survive, some of us must find a way to keep our wits about us on behalf of those who cannot.<eos> I sent six of my men after him.<eos> I instructed them to kill Captain Flint.<eos> What are we looking at?<eos> Nassau.
Only... in this moment, I'm realizing that never happened.<eos> And what is of some concern to me is that... despite how invested we each are in the future of the other... you just told me that story again.<eos> Why is that?<eos> It isn't important.<eos> All right.
Wi-Fi alarm.<eos> Too risky.<eos> Perfect.<eos> Where did a banker's daughter learn to be a car thief?<eos> Other lives.
It's like you hooked a lizard inside the snake pit.<eos> Croome may not be as dangerous as the rest of them, but in the end he's just as cold-blooded.<eos> Oh, my God, it's so good.<eos> She used to own a restaurant.<eos> Down in Busan.
- Um, if you will please excuse me.<eos> - Sure.<eos> Hi!<eos> Hi.<eos> Why bathrooms?
You know, Vincent mentioned that you had a few legal issues.<eos> Uh, nothing serious.<eos> Your show could be posted or Periscoped last minute.<eos> - Periscoped?<eos> What? - Instant invite.
These are his photographs.<eos> That's the cabin.<eos> We need to know where these pictures were taken.<eos> Do you know where these pictures were taken?<eos> Um... somewhere in California.
I will.<eos> Angelica,you're being irrational.<eos> They want to sterilize us.<eos> - It's a voluntary procedure.<eos> - For now.
Lito Rodriguez... is one of the voices in your head?<eos> Bug!<eos> - Right.<eos> Sorry.<eos> All good.
- How?<eos> - We don't know.<eos> They have more money and more autonomy than any other group we've come across.<eos> But ultimately, all that power testifies to one thing.<eos> - What?
Come on, Felix, stop trash-talking.<eos> Let's play!<eos> Wolfie! Here!<eos> Where are you?<eos> - Hey, you all right?
Lito Rodriguez... is one of the voices in your head?<eos> Bug!<eos> - Right.<eos> Sorry.<eos> All good.
- How?<eos> - We don't know.<eos> They have more money and more autonomy than any other group we've come across.<eos> But ultimately, all that power testifies to one thing.<eos> - What?
Will, no. No, stop.<eos> - This is our last chance!<eos> - If they put a bullet in you, it will be.<eos> Where you going?<eos> - In every fight...
What happened?<eos> Shock brought on by septicemia.<eos> We think he fell. Hurt himself.<eos> I found him on the floor.<eos> On the floor?
- if I told you...<eos> - Tell me.<eos> How much I love you... would it have done any good?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - How?
- We have to get to London.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> This is for you.<eos> Your gate today is number 38.<eos> To your right-hand side.
Will would come over, we'd do it together.<eos> But Will's not here. He ain't fucking here.<eos> Should a man in his condition really be drinking?<eos> I found him on the floor.<eos> On the floor?
Yeah, I've felt that way myself.<eos> I think many people have.<eos> When that happens to me, it is usually because there's something I'm afraid of.<eos> What if I do this movie and everyone finds out?<eos> What?
We don't give adrenaline unless the allergy...<eos> She needs a rescue shot.<eos> She carries one.<eos> I need an ambulance to the Horace School right away, please.<eos> All right.
And if you still hope to get Wendy back somehow, I don't see how this can help.<eos> You said you had some information on that front.<eos> Wendy and Rhoades remain separated.<eos> Where is he living?<eos> The house.
You got to pay your dues.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Big cases, ingeniously won.<eos> After years of dutiful service.<eos> Years and years.
It always has, Bobby.<eos> It just flows like this.<eos> But I'm shutting it off.<eos> I have shut it off.<eos> Okay.
Hear me out, okay?<eos> I'm not asking to work on customers, just one of my friends.<eos> In my shop, using my machines.<eos> I've done this before, dozens of times.<eos> In another country.
Seeing my art up there, easily one of the coolest moments ever.<eos> I'll never forget that.<eos> It's getting late. Uh, I should get started.<eos> Yes, Dean Peterson.<eos> All right.
Okay, yeah.<eos> Bye-bye. Uh, sure.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> Travis doesn't like my decision, and so he sends his mom?<eos> Okay, all right.
Can we not talk about this right now?<eos> I'm trying to study.<eos> Hold on.<eos> I want to hear this.<eos> Okay.
I will not yield, Madam Speaker.<eos> Because I cannot wait.<eos> One of the murderers...<eos> One of the murderers who killed Mr. Jim Miller... is still out there.<eos> At large.
Garage set on fire. Broken windows.<eos> And, uh, Hannah... well... she posted.<eos> She was defending the mother online.<eos> -When?<eos> -This afternoon.
"War, what is it good for?"<eos> Were you ever interested in investigative journalism?<eos> If you ask me, if it's not investigating, it's not journalism.<eos> Word around here is you can get anybody to talk to you.<eos> After 8:00, with a drink in their hands... yeah.
It's hard to see, but I think that was the killshot.<eos> Now, please remember, these reports are unconfirmed and we're waiting on a statement from the White House.<eos> -What we can report is a great deal...<eos> -Why are you watching this?<eos> ...this wooded area.
Do I... do I remember?<eos> I still have a scar on my ass where my dad lost hold of his belt mid swing.<eos> - Caught me with the buckle.<eos> - Bullshit.<eos> - Which part?
I still have a scar on my ass where my dad lost hold of his belt mid swing.<eos> - Caught me with the buckle.<eos> - Bullshit.<eos> - Which part?<eos> - The scar.
Ended up deciding, if she doesn't blame you, hard to see how I can.<eos> And I appreciate that, A.J. Thank you.<eos> I'm at Bernhart Bail Bonds on Gold Street.<eos> It's near the courthouse, all right?<eos> All right.
You all right?<eos> You don't look as though you've been sleeping.<eos> You've lost weight.<eos> You're not in love, are you?<eos> On my wages?
Tessa! Come here.<eos> This story, where did you get it?<eos> Straight from the horse's mouth.<eos> Morse told me at the drinks last night.<eos> In confidence.
I don't recall applying for anything.<eos> You didn't.<eos> Our clients have an algorithm that pre-selects their clientele for them.<eos> And you happen to be the perfect man for the job.<eos> - All right.
What kind of engineer needs a panic room?<eos> Good question.<eos> [sighs]<eos> I'm not supposed to talk about this... but I'm on a list.<eos> What kind of list?
I can help you go through Gracie's stuff.<eos> Listen to me, Maddie.<eos> Um, I just got off the phone with Will.<eos> Something's happening.<eos> - Where? - In the city.
RORY: Come on in.<eos> We're shocking the monkey.<eos> Trying another spot.<eos> HUGH: Nothing.<eos> Not even at a cellular level.
- MIRANDA: There must be some way.<eos> Thruster sensors.<eos> If it climbs in the nozzle, the temperature should move.<eos> Should.<eos> All right.
Okay, Hugh and I will sweep from Quest east.<eos> And, um, you and Sho scour the poles and, uh, lock off each compartment.<eos> SHO: (PANTING) It will take about four hours to vent all oxygen. - MIRANDA:<eos> What do we do till then? - DAVID: We wait.<eos> You okay?
You shared with him what we do here together?<eos> How much you pay me.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> And?<eos> The wig.
No, that's not what I'm talking about.<eos> Oh. That.<eos> Me.<eos> Yeah. You.<eos> Your fangs, your eyes, the growl.
And will the judge accept just identification?<eos> That is why I am sending her for the medical.<eos> Hello.<eos> Yes?<eos> Fine, okay.
- Yes.<eos> Right there.<eos> Listen, I want nobody there.<eos> We have to meet secretly.<eos> Bye.
Listen to me, you piece of shit.<eos> I-I don't know what kind of sick fuck digs his mother's body out of a grave and moves it around, okay, and I don't want to know about it or what you did to it.<eos> All I can tell you is, I can shoot you once I find her, and I can make it quick and clean, or I can make you suffer for days, and believe me, I got ideas.<eos> Now you tell me how you want to do this.<eos> All right.
That is a lie.<eos> It... it was you.<eos> It was you. It was your way of trying to get rid of me.<eos> And I'm still alive.<eos> For now.
The traitor was hung.<eos> Le traître a été pend...<eos> What kind of French course is this?<eos> - Where were you really today?<eos> - The village.
For six hours?<eos> I went to see Romero in prison.<eos> Why?<eos> To tell him that you know he sent someone to kill you and you're still alive?<eos> - Basically, yes.
- Of course.<eos> Uh, which credit card will you be using today?<eos> - Uh, cash.<eos> - Cash is fine.<eos> All right.
So, your book is nonfiction.<eos> So, where is this time machine?<eos> See here.<eos> Please.<eos> All right.
Don't move.<eos> How ya doin'? How's your head?<eos> It hurts.<eos> Um, may I ask, where am I?<eos> Manhattan General.
We melt, implode, cease to exist.<eos> I prefer not to find out.<eos> But that is why time travel is dangerous.<eos> In the wrong hands, it could, quite frankly, destroy the world.<eos> Okay, then.
Move!<eos> The Wells exhibit!<eos> Move!<eos> Damn it, Wells.<eos> On the radio.
I don't think that you can stay here, chick. It just might not be a good idea.<eos> - Norman, it's okay.<eos> I know about her.<eos> - You--you know about who?<eos> - About your mother.
Known her since we were in Mogadishu together 15 years ago.<eos> Now she's sending me an emergency message from a stolen phone, calling me to one of our old dead letter drops.<eos> This from one of the best intelligence officers I know who, believe me, has never been one to cry wolf.<eos> We have eyes.<eos> In position.
- One, two, get up.<eos> - No.<eos> - Crash team standing by?<eos> - Front entrance.<eos> Almost there.
Yeah, I'd like that.<eos> But I gotta tell you, talking's not really my... Strong point.<eos> My cell's on the back.<eos> You're an attorney?<eos> Environmental.
Okay, move now.<eos> Stay frosty, Bro.<eos> If you didn't know Clara was in Kentucky,<eos> - where did you think she was?<eos> - Syria.
Stay frosty, Bro.<eos> If you didn't know Clara was in Kentucky,<eos> - where did you think she was?<eos> - Syria.<eos> Turkey.
If you didn't know Clara was in Kentucky,<eos> - where did you think she was?<eos> - Syria.<eos> Turkey.<eos> That whole mess.
Tell your buddies no heroics, Germany.<eos> Copy that, Lucas is, still on the street.<eos> We just lost the cameras.<eos> - Where's the power source?<eos> - Basement.
And that's what Clara Ward, a CIA officer, who was also stationed in the area, found out and shared with Senator Wilkes.<eos> Soldiers?<eos> Soldiers fight for their country.<eos> What you mean is you just follow orders.<eos> For money.
So, starting right now, we control the story.<eos> Write State and Local Law Enforcement, FBI, CIA.<eos> I want everyone on the same sheet of music.<eos> This was two delusional maniacs, investigation ongoing.<eos> Okay?
- I got one in the leg.<eos> I'll be okay.<eos> Went straight through.<eos> - Where are you?<eos> - Some hotel in Jersey.
It's not happening, buddy.<eos> No can do.<eos> Four years undercover with these bastards.<eos> I know how they think.<eos> All right.
Four years undercover with these bastards.<eos> I know how they think.<eos> All right.<eos> Motel Biscayne, Route 202, Junction 7.<eos> Okay.
You honestly think I know where Carlos Mejia is?<eos> I think you can do better than that.<eos> My only contact with the cartel is a lawyer.<eos> - Where?<eos> - New York.
Patch in Echelon.<eos> Action NSA and FBI.<eos> Langley, info only.<eos> Done, done, and almost done.<eos> Okay.
It-it just means that this rib doesn't belong to our victim.<eos> This is impossible.<eos> There must be at least 200 different sets of<eos> - It's like excavating a mass grave.<eos> No, Mr. Bray.
Farm's about 20 miles ahead.<eos> Aubrey and a few SWAT guys are gonna meet me there.<eos> All right? I just want you to stay in the car.<eos> No. Where you go, I go.<eos> All right, fine.
I thought I wanted to move, but after everything that's happened in the last couple of days, I realized this is where I belong.<eos> Well, I for one will be happy to see you around, and I'm guessing there's a certain quirky, red-headed anthropologist who might also be happy to hear this?<eos> Yeah. She, uh... she broke up with me.<eos> Oh, Cher. Sorry.<eos> You okay?
Yeah? We deserve it all.<eos> - Mm-hmm! - You're damn right!<eos> Uh, Iris? We did something like this at my high school, trying to keep it deaf and limit the number of hearing students allowed in.<eos> In my experience, it's not a bad idea to ask for more than you're willing to settle for.<eos> All right.
- What?<eos> I had to threaten to call the cops just to get my security deposit back.<eos> That is awful.<eos> Where are you staying now?<eos> My car.
Oh, hey, there's better reception in the bedroom. Oh.<eos> What are those?<eos> Ah, Ally's inbetween apartments right now, uh, so I told her that she could stay with us.<eos> - Everything okay?<eos> - Mm-hmm, definitely.
Yeah, I mean, don't you ever think about your dad or Angelo?<eos> I'd like to believe that we go on after we die, that there's life after this one, but...<eos> I don't.<eos> I think when we're done, we're done.<eos> Okay.
Who would want to kill a guy like this?<eos> You know, you're awfully quiet.<eos> You're not upset about Angela winning that whole McDonald's award?<eos> MacArthur.<eos> No, not in the slightest.
So I was finally able to download AMI's neural network and it looks like this audio file is the last thing AMI recorded before her memory was wiped clean.<eos> I look forward to meeting you, too.<eos> No, let's keep it between us for now.<eos> 4:00. 3300 Industrial Drive,<eos> East Roanoke.
You know what?<eos> I-I don't want to talk about this.<eos> We got a case.<eos> Let's focus.<eos> Okay, fine. Good.
What were they gnawing on?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I found, uh, particulates of lead paint, so maybe they were gnawing on some cabinets, looking for food.<eos> When was lead paint banned?<eos> 1978.
- What's up with the vending machine?<eos> - Oh, I'm so sorry, Meredith.<eos> The repairman will be here next week.<eos> If you wouldn't mind...<eos> Next week?
Twilight Zone reruns, actually.<eos> Everything about you makes more sense now. Mm.<eos> Did you need something?<eos> Uh, yes. I found blunt force trauma everywhere.<eos> The legs, the ribs, the skull.
Absolutely.<eos> Why wouldn't it be?<eos> Well, you never go outside to take a call, so why the sudden need for privacy?<eos> Oh, I was just catching up with an old friend.<eos> At 8:00 in the morning?
But the struggle is real.<eos> Well, I am flattered, and appalled by your lack of professionalism.<eos> Now, I'm finding adhesive capsulitis and tendinitis on the victim's capsular ligament.<eos> So the victim had a repetitive stress injury?<eos> Yeah, but only on the right shoulder.
Well, too bad.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen...<eos> Would you mind if we ask you a few questions?<eos> Well, they need me at the main stage, but, uh, you-you can walk with me.<eos> Okay.
Thank you.<eos> Whoa, whoa, Bones.<eos> Bones, let's just wait. Wait.<eos> Just wait until she puts down that big chain saw before we accuse her of murder, okay?<eos> All right!
Um, by the way, I think I found something on the lobbyist's rib.<eos> Didn't Brennan already analyze the lobbyist's bones?<eos> She missed something.<eos> Brennan missed something?<eos> On a bone?
Uh, yes.<eos> Thank you?<eos> What about the woman?<eos> Um, the one who plays the clarinet?<eos> Oboe.
Thank you?<eos> What about the woman?<eos> Um, the one who plays the clarinet?<eos> Oboe.<eos> Oboe.
You're about to bury your dad.<eos> I want to be here for you.<eos> Booth, you asked what you could do, how you could help.<eos> I think it would be good for me to be alone for a few days.<eos> Okay. Yeah, um...
Last Tuesday night.<eos> A man had given Sarah a ride home from somewhere.<eos> Hmm. I heard them outside.<eos> About what time was that?<eos> Uh, a little past 10:00.
♪ Main Title Theme ♪ The Crystal Method<eos> == sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man<eos> Well, uh, did some digging. Turns out there were 58 armed robberies in the tristate area during the week that the victim was killed.<eos> How many involved a handgun...<eos> Yeah, 19.
Or more likely, it's a high-end hair oil, but I found none of that in the victim's own hair.<eos> Which would suggest that he put his fingers in another person's hair just prior to death.<eos> Huh. Well, I'll let Booth know.<eos> How are you guys coming?<eos> Swimmingly.
Angela?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> The effects of your hangover should have subsided by now.<eos> Are you sure you're not actually...<eos> Pregnant?
BNC is projecting that governor Frankie Vargas will carry San Benito county... And the state of California to become the next President of the United States.<eos> Wow.<eos> Amazing.<eos> Well, that's it, folks.<eos> After one of the greatest setbacks in political history,
His wife wants to tell her children.<eos> I understand that.<eos> She can't.<eos> Sir, imagine if we were talking about your children,<eos> - about you...
The tension you're experiencing right now, can you be open to the possibility that it's not about Lisbeth or Venice or what might or might not happen there?<eos> What else would it be about?<eos> It would be about... what's happening right here... between us... and... what we both know... has to happen next.<eos> Still in love?<eos> The bike?
Well, someone had to call someone.<eos> I need a tissue sample from a body.<eos> I was hoping you would go in there and get it for me.<eos> It's a dead body? Right?<eos> Mostly.
I need a tissue sample from a body.<eos> I was hoping you would go in there and get it for me.<eos> It's a dead body? Right?<eos> Mostly.<eos> Mostly?
And Liam and Lori are walking right into it.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Hey, sixty-eight.<eos> Do you know anything about Brett?<eos> Who?
- What's inside?<eos> - We were waiting for you.<eos> Golly, you didn't have to do that.<eos> Listen.<eos> Wow, indeed.
That child disappearing.<eos> Being swallowed up, forgotten.<eos> I spoke to Judge Kahn..<eos> Arrangements were made.<eos> And after all that..
We'd made something.<eos> I know it wasn't what we thought it would be or hoped it would be but it was ours.<eos> And there was Melissa, and, and you.<eos> Were you there when I was born?<eos> Close by.
Why didn't he just ask her who was shooting off the second gun?<eos> I'm sure he will, but he couldn't do that in front of you.<eos> Do you know how hard it was not to tell him about that freakin' game?<eos> Why were you even down there?<eos> At the precinct?
You saved me today.<eos> I was gonna offer you cash, but... if you're happy to be paid in fungus..<eos> Or should I say fungi?<eos> Aria?<eos> You okay?
It's a friend's.<eos> I mean the mess is mine but all the nice stuff is on loan.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I lied to you today.<eos> About Mary.
At an all girls camp.<eos> Yeah, same one my mom went to.<eos> My adopted mom.<eos> Well, you know, I actually learned how to play on this table.<eos> Right here.
Really?<eos> Yeah, I mean, it... just makes sense.<eos> At least for a little while.<eos> Where did you find all this?<eos> Uh, your attic.
The entire Radley crew is held hostage in a room for an hour and told to smile more.<eos> Even if no one in the hotel sees her the security cameras will.<eos> No, they won't.<eos> We thought we'd start things off with the press event here.<eos> In your book store.
Thank you for the cupcakes.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> No, no, remember we talked to Dr. Randall about that before you left.<eos> Right.<eos> Alright.
You were the one who rescued us five years ago.<eos> That's because you wouldn't tell me the truth and you ended up in an underground bunker.<eos> So why don't you let me help you now?<eos> Are we done here?<eos> For now.
Like, a million years ago?<eos> There was so much less to worry about.<eos> I'm really sorry that I involved you in this mess.<eos> Which mess, in particular?<eos> All of it.
- No... don't.<eos> Just don't tell your parents anything.<eos> We may be a lot closer than you think.<eos> Just... just give Mona chance to figure this out.<eos> Mona?
You're not gonna trick me this time.<eos> Mona killed Charlotte.<eos> We're gonna take her to the cops?<eos> No.<eos> Not in this condition.
- Yeah, it was pretty good. - Do you know where Tyler went?<eos> No.<eos> There you are.<eos> I've been looking everywhere for you.<eos> - Hey, you all right?
No, and I'd appreciate it if we didn't make it a... - Microscope. - A thing.<eos> - A thing? Oh, no.<eos> I can be very discreet.<eos> Cool.<eos> - Hey, handsome! - Hey! Hey.
So, while this gun battle is going on, you're sitting outside in the car.<eos> Do I have that right?<eos> He was supposed to signal.<eos> Yeah...<eos> Probably just as well.
Clive has already witnessed a full-scale zombie outbreak.<eos> That's a genie that can't really be put back in a bottle.<eos> We want to know what you mean when you talk about Seattle being a zombie homeland.<eos> How can we know if we're with you when we don't even really know what we're talking about?<eos> Ir enough.
I'm not sure.<eos> - You, Miss Moore?<eos> - What does what look like?<eos> That's brain.<eos> In the digestive tract.
Alistair's a corpse. Klaus is a prisoner.<eos> And every vampire in this town either loves you or fears you.<eos> Now all you need to worry about are the covens.<eos> Occult graffiti popping up all over town.<eos> Not just the Cauldron.
Just... that it's hard getting better.<eos> And I'm guessing that you're worried about how you're gonna be burning it off, especially when everybody's here watching you?<eos> Do you know why you feel that way?<eos> - Because I... have an addiction?<eos> - In a way, yes.
- Jesus, I didn't even think about... - I know.<eos> That's why Luke calls her "the unicorn."<eos> She gets her period once and gets pregnant off some guy she barely knows.<eos> I'm never having a baby.<eos> No way.
How is there even less of you?<eos> What did that doctor do to you?<eos> Hi, Mom.<eos> - Is this all you've got?<eos> - Yeah. All right.
But you do.<eos> Luca and I are together.<eos> As a father, I have very serious concerns about your relationship.<eos> Where are you staying now?<eos> - My car. - Ally!
And I just don't want to get all mainstream.<eos> Totally.<eos> Well, we should really get together and catch up more.<eos> - Did I hear something about a party?<eos> - Yes, upstairs.
I don't think so.<eos> Well, when we see abdominal bruise patterns like that, we assume insulin.<eos> Forearms could indicate narcotics.<eos> - Where was the site?<eos> - On his deltoid, up here.
You may be bad at Luca for not being honest with you, but you have to be honest with him.<eos> You're right.<eos> This is crazy.<eos> Let's get out of here.<eos> Man.
Wow, I didn't know that you two had been talking.<eos> That's great.<eos> Travis! Are you kidding?<eos> I would love to meet your mom.<eos> The health center?
That's great.<eos> Travis! Are you kidding?<eos> I would love to meet your mom.<eos> The health center?<eos> Good.
That may be, but violence is never the answer.<eos> Now, John is your coach. I'm gonna let him decide what to do with you.<eos> Two weekends, campus work detail.<eos> Okay, do you want three?<eos> Okay.
I'm not gonna help you cheat.<eos> But if you've stopped taking the drug, there's a chance I could help you pass the test.<eos> What drug were you taking?<eos> Colibuterol.<eos> - In what dose?
I think that's a bit of an overstatement.<eos> Do you?<eos> This wouldn't have anything to do with the fact that your daughter happens to be dating<eos> - the player in question, would it?<eos> - Not at all.
Now, you and Gemma both live here?<eos> - Did you live on the island together?<eos> - No. Well, she did, most of the year.<eos> We're doing up a house.<eos> - What, Ambersea?
I was hardly in contact with her.<eos> - Had something happened?<eos> - Not really.<eos> We were always very different.<eos> Even as kids.
That sounds doable.<eos> Then dumped the boat, make it look like an accident.<eos> So how did they get themselves back to the mainland?<eos> Hm? Swim?<eos> Not in that current.
It's the same with Davy's parents.<eos> You... lose a child, you never really come back from it.<eos> So on Tuesday, you took them to their son's memorial on the cliff.<eos> - What time was that?<eos> - Er, just after lunch.
And it's Jamil who's being sent to the office all the time... .. and I think we now know why.<eos> I don't think I can add much more than what I said in my witness statement.<eos> I was working on the north end of the island all day, hardly saw anyone.<eos> No, actually we wanted to talk to you about Gemma's husband Ryan.<eos> - Her fiance. - No, husband and wife.
Ryan's boat leaves at five, then nothing.<eos> The killer must have found a way to avoid the camera.<eos> Mm.<eos> Come on, I paid good money for these.<eos> In the church.
That's not nothing.<eos> It's not against the law, either.<eos> - We need to speak to you down at the station.<eos> - I can't come now.<eos> About that footage.
- No.<eos> But I bet the cameras at Newcastle Train Station will.<eos> - Ma'am? - Get Hicham onto it. What?<eos> We've got 'em.<eos> - At 2:46am.
Keeps the reality at bay.<eos> Whoa!<eos> A reminder!<eos> Any Picker pissing... - ...in undesignated areas will be summarily executed.<eos> Up! Up!
- That doesn't mean he can stop me.<eos> - No, you don't understand.<eos> Quinn doesn't care who lives or dies anymore.<eos> All he cares about is his boy.<eos> Your son.
It's not his fault.<eos> It's not anybody's fault.<eos> Now, we're gonna fix this because that's what we do.<eos> We're gonna bring Rip back home.<eos> You okay?
Yeah. We can't talk about what I do. You know that, right?<eos> Maybe next year?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> Hey, you know where Mom keeps the Advil?<eos> Bathroom, maybe?
What?<eos> Everything.<eos> Look, I just need a place to crash for a few days. Okay?<eos> No.<eos> No, not okay.
Well, so... we're here.<eos> We're fine. You can go now.<eos> Otto.<eos> I need a word.<eos> All right.
She's devoted to you, Otto.<eos> Don't be stupid.<eos> Tell her.<eos> Tell her what?<eos> The house painter.
GM caps should be in the blue on the bottom there.<eos> Now, you're sure I can't help you carry those to your car, Mrs. VanKamp?<eos> Don't be a silly.<eos> I only hope I didn't take too much of your time with all my dusty old photos.<eos> Goodness, no.
Who are you?<eos> A man who knows your friend there more than anyone in this prison.<eos> I was in solitary with him - for years.<eos> - Yeah, so was I.<eos> But not in the cell across from him.
Leave.<eos> If you tell the police, it will hurt all of us.<eos> Leave, or I'll tell them everything.<eos> How is she?<eos> Okay.
They're investigating Annalise.<eos> You tell them anything?<eos> No.<eos> But I might.<eos> About...?
Well, looky who's back...<eos> The boy-killer.<eos> What, you didn't think I knew how to read?<eos> What was it?<eos> One of them Mrs. Robinson type of things?
I remember something else from that night.<eos> The doctors said that it would happen, that the drugs would... wear off and that I would remember things.<eos> I, uh, saw Frank... before the explosion.<eos> Where?<eos> In the basement.
- Got it. - Frank.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Do not hurt him.<eos> - I won't.<eos> You, uh... You okay, bud?
My mother has dementia.<eos> It's fine.<eos> Just call my doctor's office and ask them if they can recommend any long-term care facilities.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Some place close.
Is it bad if I want her to stay in there?<eos> Well, a little.<eos> Would it help if I let you fornicate with me?<eos> Shut up.<eos> Actually, yes.
You're out of jail.<eos> And that's a great thing, so... do you need anything... clothes, help finding a place to stay?<eos> No, I'm good.<eos> I actually have an appointment about to start, so...<eos> Oh, okay.
So, you've never lied to legal authorities before?<eos> Well, answer the question.<eos> Answer the question.<eos> Objection, Your Honor.<eos> On what grounds, Mr. Delfino?
We started off with six employees.<eos> And Chuck helped grow us into one of the largest firms in the state.<eos> We will be forever grateful for his dedication.<eos> Do you have anything you want to say?<eos> Alright, then.
Uh, the nice folks in front said I could sit in.<eos> So, you guys ready to get to it?<eos> All: Yes.<eos> Okay. Let's wake up those spines with, uh, cat/cow position.<eos> Very good.
Sorry.<eos> Is everything all right?<eos> Yeah, no, it's fine.<eos> I just... it's been a crazy day, made more so by the fact that i forgot Mike's Spanish lesson.<eos> Mike: Spanish?
I'll let you follow.<eos> Deliver my second vehicle, and maybe I get the Phaeacians to get you a boat somewhere, to Europe, France, Italy, Spain, wherever you want to go.<eos> How's that sound?<eos> Keys are here.<eos> Left side, the red brick.
Deliver my second vehicle, and maybe I get the Phaeacians to get you a boat somewhere, to Europe, France, Italy, Spain, wherever you want to go.<eos> How's that sound?<eos> Keys are here.<eos> Left side, the red brick.<eos> First floor.
Will do, ma'am.<eos> Agent Kishida.<eos> I wasn't expecting a call at this hour.<eos> I just wanted to follow up on our earlier conversation.<eos> The situation in the Middle East?
I just wanted to follow up on our earlier conversation.<eos> The situation in the Middle East?<eos> Situation's developing.<eos> We need to meet soon.<eos> Fair enough.
Yeah. The SEAL team failed to neutralize Outis.<eos> Somehow the ship's controls were damaged.<eos> It's headed for Algerian waters with our soldiers on boards, but it'll cause a diplomatic incident if they stay to finish the job.<eos> The navy just made the call to pull the team.<eos> All right, all right.
We can do whatever we want.<eos> And if we want to disappear after this... we can disappear.<eos> There's no getting out.<eos> The guy at the gate said the vehicles split five minutes after they got here.<eos> Five minutes?
You know, as long as they have a spark in them, they're tamper proof.<eos> They'll blow us both up if we try.<eos> What about that box that Slink carries around?<eos> Can you mess with that?<eos> Well, yeah, in theory, but...
Can you mess with that?<eos> Well, yeah, in theory, but...<eos> Okay, I need four hours.<eos> Can you do it?<eos> All right.
Last time you talked about going to see her.<eos> I'm not ready.<eos> Fine.<eos> Uh... the painters left yesterday.<eos> Finally.
Pull over.<eos> My partner's back there.<eos> Just sit your ass down and shut up.<eos> - Ma'am, I'm a cop.<eos> - Yeah, a shitty one.
Don't need you fallin' asleep.<eos> Hey, you take care of that battery?<eos> Oh, yeah. It finally shit the bed, But we swapped it out a couple hours ago.<eos> - Okay. - How'd it go?<eos> No problem.
No problem.<eos> - Anyone see you?<eos> - Nah.<eos> Dead over there.<eos> A'ight.
I am, yeah.<eos> Here's a question...<eos> How come New Mexico doesn't call it the DMV like every other state?<eos> Well, that's a great question.<eos> Uh, just like in Arizona,
Well, that's wonderful. Mm-hmm.<eos> Yes, I think a will is really important.<eos> When would you like to come in and meet mr. Mcgill?<eos> "Jimmy"! Jimmy.<eos> Always Jimmy.
I don't think Howard will let him near Mesa Verde with that tape.<eos> Howard knows it would make hhm look terrible.<eos> If chuck has a plan for this tape, I don't know what it is.<eos> At this point, all we can do is wait for his move, then act accordingly.<eos> All right, then.
To my big bro.<eos> Aren't you supposed to say "amen" at the end?<eos> That was a toast not a prayer.<eos> Alexis, shut up.<eos> No, no, fair enough.
You can't do shit.<eos> What does he want?<eos> How the fuck should I know?<eos> Just like you can't touch him, he can't touch you.<eos> - Not at Ronnie's.
Vicki?<eos> Oh, fuck!<eos> Vicki?<eos> Lizzie!<eos> Lizzie!
Lizzie!<eos> Lizzie!<eos> What's going on?<eos> Quick, get a bucket.<eos> Lizzie!
Why can't you just do this one thing?<eos> After everything I've done for you.<eos> You don't understand, I saw them burn.<eos> Sorry, I just wanted to make sure everything was...<eos> - Okay.
Sorry about the camera.<eos> Like I told your friends when they came in, this is official business, so...<eos> I have to be official.<eos> Let's talk about Jace.<eos> Okay.
While we're increasing in numbers, we're also finding suitable Downworlders to hold on to for research.<eos> You should join them.<eos> They could use a good leader like you.<eos> I don't lead hunts for innocent Downworlders.<eos> Innocent?
Hopefully you're home.<eos> That's it.<eos> Bye.<eos> - Going home?<eos> - Just a detour.
I'm placing Raj by the door.<eos> Do not try this again.<eos> - I'm just under orders.<eos> - Shut up, Raj.<eos> Almost there.
You, too.<eos> Well, this is one nasty demon.<eos> Punched a hole right through his chest.<eos> With that kind of strength, I doubt it's done yet.<eos> Nothing in the immediate area.
She's hurt pretty badly, but she's gonna pull through.<eos> It's nice to hear something positive.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Mom.<eos> About Idris...
So to answer your question... Yes.<eos> It is very much possible.<eos> I have never seen a doctor's office like this.<eos> Do you live here, too?<eos> Upstairs.
It is very much possible.<eos> I have never seen a doctor's office like this.<eos> Do you live here, too?<eos> Upstairs.<eos> On the third floor.
Come in.<eos> Just wanted to see how Clary was doing.<eos> But if I'm interrupting something...<eos> - Nope.<eos> - No. Not at all.
- So you met Cleophas?<eos> - At the Citadel.<eos> I'm trying to figure out this new rune ability and...<eos> Wait, hold it.<eos> Rune ability?
It is now.<eos> If Valentine needs lightning to activate the Sword, he probably put Ithuriel up on the rooftop.<eos> Cleophas could have been lying, Clary.<eos> She's not.<eos> Not about this.
I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> She's about this tall, pigtails, always... wears a scarf.<eos> Hey, where'd you get that scarf?<eos> Nowhere.
It wasn't until this evening that I put it all together.<eos> Something Meliorn said at the Downworld meeting.<eos> I think she's getting her fix straight from the source.<eos> Where is she?<eos> Careful, Madzie.
I'm not panicking.<eos> It's true, isn't it?<eos> You're a daylighter?<eos> There's a name for it?<eos> Yeah, in the legends.
It's... it's incredible.<eos> It'll be fine! You can rock solid on your own.<eos> No. See, it's one thing to jam in the boat basin.<eos> It's another thing to... play here.<eos> In front of... actual people.
Simon has been helpful in the past.<eos> He's an ally.<eos> Don't you think throwing him in jail is a little excessive?<eos> A Downworlder cannot challenge our authority.<eos> Not in times like these.
No.<eos> But I've realized that being a Daylighter is like, totally overrated.<eos> Like, I should have got something cool, heat vision, or invisibility...<eos> - If only you were invisible. - Clary!<eos> You Okay?
I'm not a shr...<eos> You know, I think I've heard enough on that subject.<eos> Now, when did you first encounter the apparition?<eos> The ghost of Mr. Snart, when did he first appear?<eos> Back in Chicago.
Gideon, pull up George Lucas on the historical record.<eos> George Lucas, born in Modesto, California on May 14th, 1944.<eos> Named Modesto Hartman's<eos> "Insurance Salesman of the Year"<eos> in 1977, 1980, and 1983.
The spear is the MacGuffin.<eos> The what?<eos> The thing in the movie that everyone's trying to get.<eos> - Well, where is it?<eos> - In the movie?
No.<eos> Something much better.<eos> - Well?<eos> - No luck.<eos> So far.
I am not trying to...<eos> In a trio such as ours, turning one against each other for your own benefit is not only obvious, but cliché.<eos> Thawne does not treat us as equals to him.<eos> And until he does, neither of us is getting what he wants.<eos> All right.
An intradimensional quantum splicer.<eos> A splicer.<eos> I do have a plan B.<eos> I open a time portal, exposing the Speed Force, you shoot me with that, and I become fragmented throughout all of time.<eos> The past, present, future.
You wanna splice yourself throughout time?<eos> Exist in every single moment there ever was?<eos> All of us aware and connected through one consciousness.<eos> I'll be everywhere...<eos> every hour, every minute.
Allison Slater.<eos> Ok.<eos> She's a decorated CIA officer who also happens to be a world champion in judo.<eos> No.<eos> Ok.
Feels wrong.<eos> She didn't want you to find someone to replace her, just someone to take on the mantle, and from where I'm sitting, that's two very different things.<eos> Sleeping beauty awakes.<eos> Where am I?<eos> Someplace safe.
Pain's fascinating, isn't it?<eos> I told you I was gonna make sure that you were dead this time.<eos> Do it.<eos> You know you want to.<eos> Yeah, ok.
Just make sure it happens.<eos> Yes?<eos> Mayor Ramos here to see you.<eos> Send him in.<eos> - Irv.
Anything to do with his service.<eos> No unit patches, no challenge coins, no souvenirs, no uniform, no beret.<eos> Just this one picture.<eos> He kept his things at The Bin.<eos> Downtown? On Fifth Street?
Did you learn how to put a condom on a banana?<eos> I'm pretty sure that's ninth grade, actually.<eos> It was so slimy.<eos> Ew! All right! Enough.<eos> Not a the dinner table.
Ana and the baby are moving in with me and Mike?<eos> - No.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I guess we're gonna move into that three-bedroom in our building.<eos> Great.
What's the point?<eos> The point is to scare your attacker, love.<eos> To draw attention to him, so hopefully he runs away.<eos> So should I have screamed when Nick was in my bedroom?<eos> No, in that situation, no.
Actually, I do have an idea.<eos> But I don't think Monte's going to like it.<eos> - Just have to leave a little early for school.<eos> - Yeah. Hey, Callie, can I talk with your mom alone, please?<eos> - Okay.
I mean... I...<eos> I would take care of everything.<eos> And I'll help.<eos> Sure, let's... let's do it.<eos> All right!
Yeah, in that case, maybe we'll convert it back to a garage.<eos> - Ha-ha, very funny.<eos> - Ha-ha-ha.<eos> Listen, I need to talk to you about something.<eos> Okay.
Listen, I need to talk to you about something.<eos> Okay.<eos> Will wants to ask you for my hand in marriage.<eos> And, uh, he wanted to do it before, but he didn't think you liked him.<eos> Okay.
Okay, well, me breakin' the news to him is not a plan,<eos> Ma, and it's not even an option, okay?<eos> You're a grown... woman, kind of, so you go talk to him.<eos> Ma?<eos> Okay.
Is that what kids are saying at school?<eos> They're just asking me if you two are gonna... do it, you know, demonstrate.<eos> Do we have to have the sex ed class here?<eos> Honey, I guess I could try to find a community room somewhere.<eos> Okay.
Oh, hey, you know, we also think that you should invite Noah to the class.<eos> Why?<eos> Because you guys are dating and curious.<eos> It'd be good for him to have that information, too, don't you think?<eos> - Okay.
- Okay.<eos> - Great.<eos> One more thing to take care of.<eos> Well, I can look and see if there's a room available at the station.<eos> All right?
Uh, but it's... it's not a big deal. It's... it's okay.<eos> No, it's fine.<eos> Look, I'm sure she'd be happy to do it.<eos> Why don't you, um, just give me your name and number, and I'll have her get a hold of you.<eos> - Okay.
Why don't you, um, just give me your name and number, and I'll have her get a hold of you.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Thanks.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - All right.
Well, how was I supposed to know it wasn't a meth lab?<eos> You are... a force of nature.<eos> And, Sharon, there hasn't been a day that's gone by that I haven't woken up grateful for you, for your heart, and your wit, and your beauty, and your compassion.<eos> And Stef, I know I should've asked for your blessing before I popped the question, but I am... asking for it now.<eos> Okay.
- I would be a fool not to be.<eos> - Yes! - All right, who wants a refill?<eos> - Uh, me, right here.<eos> - There you go.<eos> - Me next.
- It rains like one day out of the year!<eos> - It's okay.<eos> I'm just sayin'<eos> I think maybe we should get the show on the road.<eos> Already on it.
Yeah, you know, the more that p... people say that... the less that I... I believe it.<eos> Are you drawing again?<eos> Can I see?<eos> No.<eos> Okay. Fine.
Well, they don't believe that Troy killed his grandmother.<eos> I can't tell them about the DNA evidence we found.<eos> Unless I wanna add breaking into Doug Harvey's house to the list of charges against me.<eos> Do you know, uh, where Vanessa's ex-husband lives?<eos> Uh, yeah, Los Angeles.
Let's see what that douche bag got.<eos> Nice work, Todd.<eos> - _ - Karma's a bitch.<eos> So is payback.<eos> Alright.
Aaron?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Allison was my mother's name, and she was named after her.<eos> They're also both the biggest cheaters you'll ever meet.<eos> - Like games, cards...
Okay, well, I am still thinking about it.<eos> I mean, you know, we could rent it out for extra money, quite honestly.<eos> Mom.<eos> Hey, listen!<eos> Sure, okay.
Lindsay never did that.<eos> Um, where's Dad?<eos> Uh, golf, of course.<eos> Right, and the donuts?<eos> In the kitchen.
Uh, just no acrobatics, basically.<eos> Got it.<eos> And the doctor also suggested that Jesus be supine.<eos> What's... what is that?<eos> On the bottom.
- Mariana, it's a really big ask.<eos> I know, but I'm sure he'd only be living out there<eos> - for a couple months tops.<eos> - Out where?<eos> - The garage?
I was just with him a little while ago, he didn't say anything.<eos> - No, I'm... I'm sure.<eos> - Did you?<eos> Hey, did you know about Emma?<eos> What... what about?
Just go home, polish your hockey mask or something, and I'll just tell Oliver you were here the whole time.<eos> That's cool, right?<eos> I'm... Sure, except you're fresh out of rehab, not a politician, about to face the media, so what's it hurt to have a little help?<eos> Oh, just my waking sanity.<eos> All right.
Do whatever you want.<eos> I'm not telling you anything.<eos> There are thousands, maybe millions of lives at stake.<eos> You don't want those deaths on your conscience.<eos> My conscience?
You know, 10 a.m. will be here before you know it.<eos> How about another dry run?<eos> Take a seat.<eos> - Attaboy. - Quit calling me Hoss.<eos> All right.
My past doesn't have to be my anchor, and I think my past is what was... Stopping me from moving things forward with you.<eos> Looking at all this, I can understand why.<eos> What exactly happened to you on that island anyway?<eos> Things that I'm not ready to talk about.<eos> Not even this crazy tattoo?
Cakewalk.<eos> In fact, I asked her if she went easy on me, and she said she did because of something you said to her.<eos> I didn't say much.<eos> I just told her a story about you and me.<eos> You and me?
Thank you.<eos> Hey, man, my name's Rene Ramirez.<eos> I work for the deputy mayor.<eos> This is my assistant.<eos> In his dreams!
I know I screwed up and...<eos> But you didn't make a mistake.<eos> You made a choice.<eos> And you reminded me of someone.<eos> Who?
But you didn't make a mistake.<eos> You made a choice.<eos> And you reminded me of someone.<eos> Who?<eos> Mom.
But you must have captain with you who is not me.<eos> I'll lose him.<eos> Really good at losing people.<eos> I got bullet fragments and cases coming out of my ass but nothing new.<eos> All right.
They aim themselves.<eos> Hoss.<eos> Yo, Hoss, that was badass.<eos> That mean no more ball jokes?<eos> Hell, no.!
What I mean is, you didn't know about this beforehand, did you?<eos> No. I had no idea.<eos> Once you did, you made them make it right, right?<eos> - Are we off the record?<eos> - Yes. - Yeah.
A good friend of mine told me that if you're going to try to fight fire with fire, you're gonna get burned, but then another friend of mine came through something pretty scary tonight because he had backup, a team.<eos> You're accepting the invitation to join Helix.<eos> Yes, full throttle.<eos> - Hey. I thought we could talk.<eos> - About?
I've been texting her like crazy, but her phone's off.<eos> You don't think that Prometheus has...<eos> No.<eos> No. His game is Susan.<eos> For now.
We should go to Pike, tell him Chase is the Throwing Star Killer.<eos> And then he asks for evidence, and you say what?<eos> Look. Quentin's right. Dinah, we keep the SCPD out of this until we have something.<eos> This guy has us in check.<eos> Yeah, for now.
I'm not gonna shoot.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> When Kovar hears about this, you cannot say you saw me, do you understand?<eos> If you say you saw me, he'll hurt you.<eos> All right?
Listen to me.<eos> When Kovar hears about this, you cannot say you saw me, do you understand?<eos> If you say you saw me, he'll hurt you.<eos> All right?<eos> All right.
Russia became not stronger but...<eos> Diseased.<eos> And samovol'shchnia was the cure once.<eos> It could be so again.<eos> All right.
Blueberries weren't the only surprise in those pancakes.<eos> I knew they were funky.<eos> Um, can we talk in private?<eos> - No.<eos> - Fine.
Hello. Wake up.<eos> Who is this?<eos> Sean Renard.<eos> I'm coming over.<eos> At this hour?
I want him found!<eos> You chose the wrong side, Sean.<eos> We located Burkhardt's car.<eos> - Where?<eos> - Laurelhurst.
- We lost it.<eos> We were followed too, but I'm pretty sure we lost them in a bar downtown.<eos> Yeah, they were watching the loft when we left.<eos> You left your car in Laurelhurst.<eos> Last night.
They are searching the hell out of that area.<eos> Well, that should keep 'em busy for a while.<eos> - We contacted HW.<eos> - Is anyone still alive?<eos> Not here in Portland.
Well, that's why I brought it up personally.<eos> What kind of awkward are we talking about?<eos> Captain Renard's fingerprints are all over that place.<eos> I know she was working on his campaign, but I think she was working on something else.<eos> All right.
He's been helping me tutor Max.<eos> And how do you know Isabelle?<eos> Raphael is the leader of the Brooklyn clan.<eos> Our paths cross occasionally.<eos> For work.
But I took care of him.<eos> By "took care of," you mean...<eos> Dead, dead, dead.<eos> I'd like a moment alone with the Daylighter.<eos> - Alone?
- Hi.<eos> - Latte for the lady.<eos> What're you looking at?<eos> Uh, there.<eos> In the shadow.
All with enough access and clearance to pull it off.<eos> - Send me the list when you're done.<eos> - By the angel.<eos> - Aline.<eos> - In the flesh.
Collier and our civilian.<eos> The guy was here stripping wire.<eos> I took a look inside too, sir.<eos> I thought I'd get a little jump on things.<eos> All right.
That's all that matters.<eos> You won't find him.<eos> Listen to me very carefully because what I'm telling you is important.<eos> You shot Elena. You left her in that state.<eos> In that bed.
You won't find him.<eos> Listen to me very carefully because what I'm telling you is important.<eos> You shot Elena. You left her in that state.<eos> In that bed.<eos> Persistent, vegetative state.
- Careful.<eos> - They have found her head.<eos> - Not possible.<eos> - I fucking saw it.<eos> In a yellow bag.
- Well, they have it.<eos> How?<eos> Some lunatic in an anorak led them to it.<eos> Where?<eos> Some fucking... shed.
Could you?<eos> - What is this, a post-mortem?<eos> - Don't know...<eos> He's been opened up before.<eos> Right down the middle.
So is the roci gonna be okay, or what?<eos> Don't worry, we're gonna treat her like one of our own.<eos> In the meantime, you look like you could blow off some steam.<eos> I see you're from some rock, care to put the ball to the wall?<eos> Pashang,yeah!
Give it to me.<eos> The universe just kissed me on the cheek.<eos> Are those people talking?<eos> Not people, pulses.<eos> Steady, like a clock.
Goddammit! Stay off this channel!<eos> Diogo! I got a puncture, I need a hand!<eos> Dude, I got problems of my own!<eos> - Use the sealant... - I'm leaking air!<eos> In your chest pouch!

But now I'm getting the feeling that you're not being straight with me.<eos> Well, I understand paranoia is a natural state of mind for a soldier.<eos> After you left Eros, with Miller, the first time...<eos> On your way back, you cut thrust for nearly five hours.<eos> What for?
Not all the details, nothing about the protomolecule, just about them.<eos> A Belter and an Earther who was an OPA member, that sacrificed themselves to save the cradle of humanity.<eos> The inners need to hear that.<eos> You're going to turn them into a story.<eos> A love story.
They saved our lives, for starters.<eos> If any side believes they have a strategic advantage by using the protomolecule, then eventually someone will.<eos> And then we're going to have another Eros or worse.<eos> The only way to prevent that is to destroy it.<eos> All of it.
Go, take your men that way.<eos> You down there.<eos> Holden: Alex,whichpodwas Milleron?<eos> Alex: I'm on it.<eos> Millerwason theotherpod.
And I see no reason why the role she so dramatically filled... the Belle of Salem... should not fall to the worthy beauty<eos> You're the last person I thought I'd see in this place.<eos> I came to see the Madame of the house.<eos> Do you not recognize me, old friend?<eos> In the flesh.
Have you seen where they've hidden the weapon?<eos> My eyes cannot be everywhere at once, but my cat will search the town for the weapon.<eos> No.<eos> Try Bishop... to C4.<eos> Check.
My eyes cannot be everywhere at once, but my cat will search the town for the weapon.<eos> No.<eos> Try Bishop... to C4.<eos> Check.<eos> Check!
Yes, play.<eos> For the sport of it.<eos> Fun.<eos> The challenge.<eos> To what end?
Part spirit.<eos> Part angel.<eos> Part animal.<eos> Mostly animal.<eos> Indeed.
Uh, yes. This is the amazing new company PiperChat.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> I saw you at TechCrunch.<eos> You're Richard Hendricks.<eos> - The very same. Yeah.
- Well, assuming we don't get arrested, looks like we have to work our asses off to reduce our hosting bill.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> If you actually get to a million users... call me. My cell's on the back.<eos> Oh, okay.
And as of now, we've got the votes... of enough key Malaysian ministers to proceed with construction, but that support is time-critical.<eos> We'd have to break ground before monsoon season or else the entire project could collapse.<eos> So, what do you think?<eos> Sorry. About what?<eos> About the factory.
Right now, they're sailing across the Narrow Sea, hoping to take back her father's throne.<eos> Our little brother, the one you love so much, the one you set free, the one who murdered our father and our first-born son, now he stands beside our enemies and gives them counsel.<eos> He's out there somewhere at the head of an armada.<eos> Where will they land?<eos> Dragonstone.
Dragonstone.<eos> They have deep-water ports for the ships.<eos> Stannis left the castle unoccupied, and that's where she was born.<eos> Enemies to the east.<eos> Enemies to the south...
And I am an excellent judge of character.<eos> If he does rule the North, he would make a valuable ally.<eos> The Lannisters executed his father and conspired to murder his brother.<eos> Jon Snow has even more reason to hate Cersei than you do.<eos> Very well.
Lawyer.<eos> Ah. What were you doing in Chicago?<eos> You wouldn't believe me if I told you.<eos> Try me.<eos> Chicago.
It's just an ornament.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Men died protecting it.<eos> So we hide it, hold onto it for leverage in case they come for us again.<eos> Perhaps in the cave.
Right, 'cause it's just money.<eos> Or another choice is I could leave.<eos> I don't want to, but... it is an option.<eos> You know what?<eos> Fine. Fine.
You were angry.<eos> I understand.<eos> I even forgive you, but-but killing me is not the way.<eos> So you admit you killed Isabella?<eos> Fine.
I felt like there was someone inside of me, someone stronger and... and smarter.<eos> Someone that people would fear.<eos> No one else saw that.<eos> Except Penguin?<eos> - Except Oswald.
I'm going to force the Court to reveal themselves.<eos> What is the one thing that every secret organization is afraid of?<eos> Being exposed.<eos> Bingo.<eos> Finally.
I know what you're thinking, brother,<eos> Lee stealing the virus, that's weird.<eos> But injecting herself? Hmm? This is Lee we're talking about.<eos> You didn't hear what she said to me last night, Harvey.<eos> Okay, fine.
But you're just delaying the inevitable.<eos> Where's your far better half?<eos> Where you going, kitty cat?<eos> What were you thinking about?<eos> My parents.
But whatever you had, she treats you like dirt now.<eos> She treats us both like dirt, and you know it.<eos> She doesn't deserve your loyalty.<eos> What are you two whispering about?<eos> Nothing.
Bartholomew? Am I in trouble?<eos> Well, this is the third night in a row.<eos> I know something else that's happened three nights in a row.<eos> It's a fire.<eos> Richmond Heights.
- You ready? - Yeah.<eos> - Hey. I got you guys a plant.<eos> That's like a standard housewarming gift, right?<eos> - Yes, perfect.<eos> - Not on my Earth.
In an attempt to stop the evil speedster Savitar, I was accidentally thrust into the future, and I saw him murder the woman I love.<eos> But I won't let that happen.<eos> I'm going to do everything in my power to change the future, and I'm the only one fast enough to keep her alive.<eos> I am The Flash.<eos> Previously on The Flash...
But with you, the roles are reversed.<eos> You depend on us.<eos> Harrison Wells was always there for me, so I guess in some weird way, I just...<eos> I want to be there for Harrison Wells.<eos> - Anyway... - Yeah.
What, what did you think I was talking about?<eos> Nothing, nothing, I... you can get him any kind of animal you want as long as it has four legs.<eos> Good, great advice, four legs, copy that.<eos> Thanks for the chat. Okay, bye.<eos> Damn.

Caitlin, try, please.<eos> It worked.<eos> Thank God.<eos> - You okay?<eos> - So far, so good.
You're already crafting a version of this for your book, aren't you?<eos> "Peace finally descends upon the family West."<eos> The West family, or family West?<eos> Right, it's time I get to work.<eos> At this hour?
- Sorry about that.<eos> I'm sorry, too.<eos> I'm sorry I took the smile from your face.<eos> What are you thinking about?<eos> The future.
I mean, it can't be a coincidence, right?<eos> Harry getting lured to Gorilla City?<eos> Grodd must be planning something.<eos> Seems like he's planning to come back to this Earth.<eos> And not alone, by the sound of it.
Ugh, robbery in progress at O'Sullivan Bank.<eos> You two go.<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> - Didn't hear the news, huh?<eos> - What news?
One of us has to die.<eos> Hi. What you doing up there?<eos> Just, uh, hanging out.<eos> What're you... what're you thinking about?<eos> Wally.
I'm happy for you. Invite me to the wedding.<eos> He's gonna be so pissed.<eos> Caitlin.<eos> Listen, if I overstepped, then... I apologize.<eos> Just, after drinks the other night...

I'm so sorry.<eos> He is... unbelievable.<eos> So all you have to do is concentrate on your memories of Grodd, okay?<eos> Yeah, that won't be a problem.<eos> All right.
I've had somebody else's voice coming out of my mouth, and you were still able to see the real me.<eos> How about trusting that I can do the same thing?<eos> Sorry.<eos> I just wanted to do that, in case you changed your mind later.<eos> Quite all right.
I think maybe we can get a little bit more precise, but I'm gonna have to give it the old meta-human try.<eos> Okay. It's Iris.<eos> All right.<eos> I'll be right back, but... just let me know if you get anything, all right?<eos> All right.
As a matter of fact, I've been working on something all day.<eos> Wow. - Things really are easier in musicals.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> All right.<eos> ♪ At times like these ♪
Did it work?<eos> ♪ Can't say how the days will unfold ♪<eos> ♪ Can't change what the future may hold ♪<eos> ♪ But I want you in it ♪<eos> ♪ Every hour, every minute ♪

To do the same thing?<eos> Why? He must have needed our Earth's tech for something.<eos> Well, whatever it is, we can definitely help you figure it out, 'cause I don't know about you guys, but ever since last time you were here, I've been looking forward to some Gypsy vibe action.<eos> - That's way too much.<eos> - Embarrassing.
2024.<eos> If I trapped him, I must've figured out who he was, right?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Um, sorry, I was just thinking.<eos> About what?
Um, sorry, I was just thinking.<eos> About what?<eos> Same as you.<eos> The future.<eos> And my dad.
Why are you here, Barry?<eos> I just wanted to see you.<eos> Just wanted to see how you were doing.<eos> Now you want to know?<eos> After all this time, now?
Her name's Tracy Brown.<eos> She made the Speed Force trap for me.<eos> You're telling me my ideas about the Speed Force...<eos> - I'm right?<eos> - In the future.
[together] Speed Force Bazooka.<eos> Is better, yeah.<eos> But if the Speed Force Bazooka doesn't start working soon, we're gonna have to start calling it the Speed Force Epic Fail.<eos> - Why? What's the problem?<eos> - Okay. The accelerometer.
[scoffs] Such an embarrassing name.<eos> I like it. I think it's great.<eos> And how would you know when shellac flakes have been used?<eos> We calculate flame temperature and burn patterns, and a telltale sign is when shellac is burned into potassium perk-er-lorate or ammonium perchlorate, which is considered a high-temperature accelerant fire.<eos> Hmm.
Hand me the girard processor.<eos> It'll help me prime his neocortical and medial frontal lobes.<eos> What?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Oh, golly.
Anyway, so we were working on the iridium plating for the, um... [snaps fingers]<eos> What was it called again?<eos> The synchrotron, that's what it was.<eos> So anyway, we were struggling, and we were burning the midnight oil, and we could not get the dubnium capacitor to hold a single charge.<eos> And so all of a sudden...

But I sold it for $2000.<eos> Why is it now three? 'Sorry, honey.<eos> That's how the pawning works.'<eos> 'You sell it to me at a discounted rate' 'and I upsell it.'<eos> Okay.
Yeah, that's right.<eos> As many as I can get.<eos> Hey, I'm headed out.<eos> I'll be home later.<eos> Okay.
I had no clue.<eos> Where would Cassie go if she was trying to escape everything?<eos> You better not have cheaped-out in the meal service.<eos> - Never.<eos> - Alright.
Caroline: I always forget you're so much older than you look.<eos> Talk to me in a couple thousand years, we'll see how you're holding up.<eos> Do I want to know why your last visit to this field was around the same time a hundred witches burned to death? I had been traveling the region with my sister, looking for tasty souls to feed to Cade, and the witches took exception.<eos> Are you saying it's your fault the witches were burned<eos> - at the stake?
- no, like, plan, or...?<eos> - I have a plan.<eos> Can't wait to hear some details.<eos> Here's the only thing you need to focus on:<eos> payback.
Ah... back from the dead.<eos> How's Cade?<eos> Any words of wisdom for his disgraced ex-servant? Nope.<eos> Just chitchat.<eos> Sports, weather, movies.
Sounds dangerous.<eos> I like it.<eos> You have no idea.<eos> You see, when the door between this world and Cade's gets cracked open, the hellfire it unleashes doesn't just wipe out any siren in its proximity, it wipes out everything, for miles.<eos> In this case...
I'm on a tight schedule, so please, no talking.<eos> Any luck with that bell?<eos> Work in progress.<eos> Any luck with my brother?<eos> Work in progress.
So if Damon is the answer to getting your humanity back, and not me, fine.<eos> I will do whatever it takes.<eos> And we will love each other forever or we won't.<eos> And we'll make our relationship work... or we won't.<eos> But either way,
Screw forgiveness.<eos> My beautiful children.<eos> Still broken after all these years.<eos> Cade.<eos> In the flesh.
You didn't have to try so hard.<eos> Based on what I see in your memory, money was the least of her needs.<eos> Now, you were right to wonder about all of her lunch dates.<eos> Tuesdays and Thursdays.<eos> Always at his place.
Or as many of them as we can.<eos> You need to take full advantage of the perks of your immortality.<eos> While I'm still immortal, you mean?<eos> Exactly.<eos> No time like the present.
By the way, he's out in the world.<eos> Walking around, taking in the sights.<eos> Look, Damon's on it.<eos> He's got a plan.<eos> But in the meantime,
I think I am.<eos> But the second you stop feeding them evil people, things get ugly.<eos> Also literal.<eos> So, wait, that's what kept them going?<eos> Evil people?
Yes.<eos> Everything's okay. The girls are fine.<eos> We've just been on the road.<eos> Where are you now?<eos> Uh, at the Armory.
Well, we still need to keep them safe.<eos> Oh, we will.<eos> It'll be good to come home.<eos> And I'll need some good parenting advice.<eos> About what?
Now it's time for you to pony up.<eos> Fine.<eos> I will give you one soul.<eos> No! - Ah! - Oh, oh,<eos> - You okay?
I have to say... I'm intrigued.<eos> Well, act now, because it's a one-time offer.<eos> Are you aware of what you're offering me?<eos> My soul.<eos> In eternal anguish.
I hope that you do.<eos> So what have you guys come up with?<eos> Cade was killed with a dagger that was made from his bones.<eos> It was fused into glass by a white-hot flame.<eos> First things first, though,
But before we begin, if anyone has any objections to this union, please speak now or forever hold your peace.<eos> Yep. Speak right now.<eos> Anyone?<eos> As in... now.<eos> Right now.
Previously on The Vampire Diaries...<eos> When that bell rings 12 times, the the hellfire it unleashes, wipes out everything for miles.<eos> In this case...
And I owe it all to Stefan.<eos> When I met him, I had lost my parents and I was dead inside.<eos> But he brought me back to life.<eos> And I'm going to live it as best I can, for as long as I can.<eos> Even after our long and happy life together,
They are inconsequential.<eos> You're different.<eos> He's different when he's with you.<eos> Does that threaten you?<eos> Perhaps at first.
Lucifer, what the hell are you doing?<eos> You know that stuff doesn't work on me.<eos> Right.<eos> Yes, no, of course. I was, joking.<eos> Right.
I've been trying to kind of...<eos> You know what?<eos> Never mind.<eos> It's definitely not getting the reaction I was expecting.<eos> - Right. - So, just... no.
Meaning?<eos> Meaning less hall monitor, more, sort of, hot for teacher.<eos> So, do you mind if I...<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Right.
Okay, Lucifer?<eos> I let my anger get the better of me and now Chloe's gonna pay for it.<eos> What, so this isn't some elaborate game of bloody possum?<eos> Of course not!<eos> Oh, well, in that case...
Some street racers secretly add drops of ZX3 to their fuel for a super shady advantage.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I used to steal cars.<eos> It's not fun if you don't drive 'em really, really fast.<eos> Anyway,
I used to steal cars.<eos> It's not fun if you don't drive 'em really, really fast.<eos> Anyway,<eos> I know where some black market ZX3 is locked up:<eos> a chop shop in NoHo.
It's so wet.<eos> Stop complaining.<eos> We're here because one of our fellow angels has taken a human wife.<eos> They also have a small daughter.<eos> A Nephilim?
It's not like we're in the "live till you're 90, die in your sleep" business.<eos> This only ends one way.<eos> Castiel?<eos> Mary. Where are you?<eos> Lawrence, Kansas.
But whatever's happened to Moose and Squirrel, apparently, it's above their pay grade.<eos> Do you even care that they're gone?<eos> No.<eos> Do you know how many all-powerful beings have tried to kill them?<eos> Roughly, yes.
Castiel, it's me.<eos> I'm just calling to...<eos> You don't have to worry about that thing in Missouri.<eos> I'm handling it.<eos> You good?
Yeah, of course. I think we got our witch.<eos> What, you don't remember any of this?<eos> It's like watching myself on Netflix.<eos> That guy look familiar to you?<eos> That jacket?
We kinda sound like heroes to me.<eos> Hey. Whoa. And our best friend's an angel.<eos> What? !<eos> We just gotta get you cured.<eos> Yeah. Okay. Hey.
Why are you telling me this?<eos> Because I know you won't remember.<eos> You're in?<eos> Shh. Yeah, I'm in.<eos> All right.
Keep a lookout. Don't die.<eos> Everything is gonna be fine.<eos> Mary?<eos> Where were you?<eos> Bathroom.
It's not gonna work.<eos> We took down the Darkness and the Devil.<eos> It took you years to defeat Lucifer, and the power of God to stop the Darkness.<eos> Maybe if you had more time, you could manage Ramiel.<eos> But right now, in this barn...
Nice new digs, by the way.<eos> Cozy.<eos> Get this. It looks like there was another murder.<eos> It's just like the one we're checking up on.<eos> Iowa?
Cozy.<eos> Get this. It looks like there was another murder.<eos> It's just like the one we're checking up on.<eos> Iowa?<eos> No, Andover, Massachusetts.
So it wasn't a sales pitch?<eos> Ha. 'Cause it was a good one. I checked the areas upstairs.<eos> This place is a ghost town.<eos> You got anything?<eos> Indeed.
I don't think there's any great solutions here.<eos> Dean...<eos> Please?<eos> I can't.<eos> All right.
Hey!<eos> I'm, uh, Herb Nelson.<eos> I run this joint.<eos> Pleasure to meet you,<eos> Agent...
All right, Peaches, I get that you're still upset about the whole, uh...<eos> Upset?<eos> No, I'm totally over how you and your little band of misfits sent my son back in time... to die!<eos> Okay, look, that was totally Gavin's call.<eos> All right?
Okay, look, that was totally Gavin's call.<eos> All right?<eos> You know what?<eos> We have a situation here.<eos> Oh, well, in that case...
You here for a reason?<eos> I am, and it's a bit urgent.<eos> Some time ago, the home office recorded some sort of cosmic shock wave.<eos> Very rare.<eos> And after a few months of...
Crowley's got, like, two and a half more hours of gettin' his pert, royal ass kissed.<eos> Well, upper left quadrant is sound.<eos> Restoration's holding.<eos> No laminations detected.<eos> Lower left, likewise.
No body.<eos> But Mick says this place has a history.<eos> Meaning?<eos> Well, it means a lot of people go missing in tomahawk, one a year, every year, from 1898 to 1997, and then nothing until now.<eos> So 20 years?
Seriously?<eos> I don't like it any more than you do.<eos> I'd much rather be with your mother.<eos> Hunting.<eos> For... Chupacabra in Texas.
Perhaps we could find some privacy and tire ourselves out.<eos> It's not illicit motel sex, but...<eos> I remember us agreeing that was a onetime thing.<eos> Did we?<eos> Ah, well.
Ow! Max! Stop!<eos> Reveal. Now!<eos> Reveal!<eos> The... The room, end of the hall.<eos> Top of the stairs.
He wants to meet.<eos> The old iron works off the interstate.<eos> Tomorrow night at 9:00.<eos> He says park off the road by the warehouse.<eos> All right.
I'm guessing that goes double for werewolf hunters, so...<eos> No, I don't have time to explain.<eos> You and Bess need to get someplace safe.<eos> Okay?<eos> All right.
I...<eos> Perhaps.<eos> But I need my rig.<eos> Where is it?<eos> At the base.
Paige, I need you to pull up the location of one of our assets, and I need you to keep it between us.<eos> Who?<eos> Mary Winchester.<eos> She's in...<eos> Lebanon, Kansas.
I thought if I could put the Devil on a leash... my own personal nuke, no one would ever dare challenge me again.<eos> Yeah. That worked out great.<eos> All ended with me narrowly escaping death by hiding in a rat.<eos> Wait.<eos> In an...actual rat?
Okay. Okay.<eos> You're okay.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> No, Cass.<eos> Pretty far from all right.
I've been doing this for nearly 30 years. I'm bloody good at it.<eos> Unlike whoever threw out my front page this week - and substituted this.<eos> Kittens in a bin.<eos> It's kittens escaping from a bin.<eos> - On the front page?
You want us to turn it down? Cos that won't put Joe Miller in prison.<eos> I'm still fighting, Beth.<eos> I know. That's the problem.<eos> Maggie?<eos> Everything all right?
Said he'd get back to it one day.<eos> Hasn't happened like he hoped.<eos> Erm, what time did he get in on Saturday night?<eos> More like Sunday morning.<eos> Past one.
And you've got no idea who it was?<eos> How many men were at your party?<eos> Too many.<eos> How many do you think'd be capable?<eos> What, after a few drinks?
You didn't hear the person behind you before you were hit?<eos> No. No, only at the last minute. I could almost feel the air moving.<eos> How far did he carry me?<eos> I don't know how close it is.<eos> You OK?
- You work from home? - Yeah.<eos> Not many offices would want me in there now, would they?<eos> No.<eos> Where were you last Saturday night?<eos> Fishing.
Otherwise he wins, whoever he is, and we're not having that.<eos> Oh, I've asked Leah to come too as well. You know, just in case.<eos> Anyway, sorry, go on - ask what you need to ask.<eos> Um, what time did you arrive at Axehampton House the night of your party?<eos> Um, just after 6:00.
- Bloody hell, Ed!<eos> Prick.<eos> Good on you, girl.<eos> - You alright? - Yeah.<eos> Hello, love. Hello, darling.
Right, uh...<eos> I'm away, Miller.<eos> You should be too.<eos> Should take a moment off, have a breather.<eos> You alright?
- No agenda?<eos> - No.<eos> We're not talking about anything else.<eos> No Joe Miller. No, no. I promise.<eos> Just about us.
Any future jury could take a negative inference if you refuse.<eos> Aaron, can you clarify for us where you were this past Saturday night, between approximately 10pm and 5am.<eos> - I was fishing.<eos> - Where were you fishing?<eos> - Off the beach.
- We'll need the shoes.<eos> - By the door.<eos> Why was there twine in your suit, Ed?<eos> I was working in the shop before I went to the party, catching up on things.<eos> - In your suit?
- Dad.<eos> - All right, darlin'?<eos> Where are you?<eos> Oh, I'm... just out for a walk.<eos> What, this time of night?
I'd have gone home. If it was a normal day.<eos> What about Saturday 7th of June, 2014?<eos> - What? Going back two years?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Same answer. Garage and home.
We were setting up, erm... had a bit of an exchange.<eos> He's naughty.<eos> And later, service was over...<eos> He was being a bit cheeky, stashed me some champagne and asked if I wanted to go for a walk.<eos> What time?
That was it. Decision made.<eos> I was right, though, wasn't I?<eos> Well, you're always right.<eos> About pretty much everything.<eos> Not everything. But pretty much.
What you watching this for?<eos> I never wanted that day to end.<eos> Ed Burnett's gone.<eos> And Jim Atwood.<eos> You OK?
She will return.<eos> How long will you be gone, Lady?<eos> All I know is that I cannot stay.<eos> We are Wessex, of course, and to our north lies Mercia, our allies.<eos> Mm-hmm, and to the east?
I will not be silenced.<eos> Lord Ceolwulf, perhaps a seat?<eos> It has been a long journey.<eos> It has.<eos> For a purpose.
Of course, Lord.<eos> Master Sverri and your friend Hakka have good news.<eos> We're finished now until the spring.<eos> Winter will be on land.<eos> Iceland.
A letter is constant, whereas I shall merely come and go.<eos> Think of this as a reward, Aethelwold.<eos> You have proven yourself, both in battle and within my Witan.<eos> You have also sought greater responsibilities.<eos> In Wessex, yes.
Have you a sore arse, lord?<eos> I have a sore everything.<eos> I need a woman to rub and bathe me.<eos> We will be stopping soon enough.<eos> At Eoferwic?
Dan would never let Elena leave him for another man.<eos> And if she ever tried to leave him for another man,<eos> God knows what he would do.<eos> Where is Michael?<eos> Hunting trip.
Nudism.<eos> Nugget.<eos> Nuptial."<eos> Uh-oh, gotta go.<eos> on the planet and...
- Well, how'd she do that?<eos> - Oh, I don't know.<eos> - Well, take a guess.<eos> - Um... Well, some sort of, uh...<eos> - Some sort of what?
Ah, we were so young.<eos> Well, it seems that some proper introductions need to be made.<eos> Do you know what "herpetology" means?<eos> Well, "ology" always means "the study of... "<eos> Snakes.
I thought you were working with the President on this.<eos> I am.<eos> He asked me to look into MacLeish, and that's exactly what I'm doing...<eos> - Trying to do my job as best I can.<eos> - All right.
No. No, I don't.<eos> But he's gonna take some time off.<eos> You suspended him?<eos> No, I asked him to get some rest and refocus, give us a chance to figure out what the hell is going on.<eos> In the meantime...
Hildur, she didn't kill herself.<eos> They should have made you Sheriff!<eos> Eric.<eos> Hildur told me everything. About Munk.<eos> About this conspiracy.
Also... healer.<eos> And on this journey, your physical body will never leave this place.<eos> But your spirit... will leave your body.<eos> Yes, we've done this before.<eos> In 1942.
In that skull... terrible wisdom of the black depths.<eos> This is the most powerful magic.<eos> Meaning and belief.<eos> What you... what you and I believe slide over each other.<eos> In the tent.
Lars has found a body and this eyeball in a car.<eos> He recognized the deceased as Trude Ekeland.<eos> This is her eye.<eos> Where's the car?<eos> Top road.
He fought the thing, all by himself.<eos> Why didn't you tell someone?<eos> Because you love him?<eos> Where did you get this stuff?<eos> In Vukobejina.
I don't think that's right.<eos> And I mean no disrespect when I say this but I always thought Governor Odegard was a very attractive woman.<eos> Sexy?<eos> Yes. That's what I mean.<eos> Hildur.
Jesse loves 'em.<eos> You boosted it?<eos> Happy to cop to grand theft auto if you want to drop the rest of the beef.<eos> Go on.<eos> About the night of.
Jesse loves 'em.<eos> You boosted it?<eos> Happy to cop to grand theft auto if you want to drop the rest of the beef.<eos> Go on.<eos> About the night of.
Look, if this is awkward, tomorrow I can get an AirBnb till I find a permanent place.<eos> You're here for good?<eos> I guess I am, yeah.<eos> Where is Reggie, really?<eos> Okay.
Tomorrow, maybe.<eos> Anything I can do for you? Nah.<eos> Harry, we need to talk.<eos> About what?<eos> In person.
You gonna tell me you're gonna retire?<eos> Face-to-face.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll swing by.<eos> All right.
And some of them did.<eos> Nowadays, everybody wants to pay with plastic.<eos> I check the IDs on that.<eos> Thanks.<eos> All right.
Look... I promise I will follow you wherever you want to go when you fall in love with a guy, okay?<eos> Or a girl.<eos> I don't fall for gender.<eos> - I fall for per...<eos> - Personality.
I'll pick you up any day this week.<eos> Do we have to?<eos> I already told you everything.<eos> - I swear, there's...<eos> - Not everything.
Listen, I've changed my mind.<eos> I can't do it. - Annabelle.<eos> - I can't. I've decided not to testify.<eos> They found out, didn't they?<eos> - What?
- I can't. I've decided not to testify.<eos> They found out, didn't they?<eos> - What?<eos> - What you do.<eos> In your other life.
Does he have silverware?<eos> Okay.<eos> - Write it down.<eos> - Uh, I can drop a pin for you.<eos> No, man, on paper.
- So, I was just wondering...<eos> - A machine did this?<eos> Yup.<eos> I worked at Borders for a while.<eos> Oh, the bookstore?
My place.<eos> So, wh... I'm a nurse now?<eos> I'm sorry, do you want to go up there and wake him up and ask him yourself?<eos> - Go right ahead.<eos> - All right.
I'm gonna do the light at lunch.<eos> Well, I'm glad to hear that your car is okay, but, uh...<eos> I'm wondering about you.<eos> Are you... are you suspended?<eos> Not so far.
Okay, okay!<eos> Jesus. I'm... I'll get it.<eos> I'm gettin' it.<eos> You have your hand on a gun?<eos> Two guns.
He could be up to something, right? I...<eos> I mean, it's possible.<eos> I can watch closer next time.<eos> Really focus on this guy.<eos> All right.
Yes, I know it's her birthday, Dana.<eos> And my gift to her is all the space she's asked me for.<eos> - You want to talk about it?<eos> - Nope.<eos> - Fair enough.
Uh, you guys were airlifted before all of the test results were back, but we should be receiving them shortly.<eos> You know, maybe you could take them into the isolation room and just give them a once-over.<eos> I have to go to the bathroom.<eos> - Is it an emergency?<eos> - Like, now. Like, right now.
I know this now.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Why do these things exist?<eos> Hey, I know this is, like, your worst nightmare and everything, but it would be so cool if you could just get the maggots out of my leg now.<eos> Okay.
Aisha, your father is fighting for his life.<eos> There is no way, even in a best-case scenario, that he's going home today.<eos> You don't know anything!<eos> Dr. Williams. Dr. Williams. - Dr. Williams.<eos> You okay?
Must be something wrong with him.<eos> I'm beginning to think maybe it's me.<eos> Okay, do you have any more paper towels?<eos> Yes.<eos> Bathroom cupboard.
- So give it back.<eos> You heard about Manny?<eos> What?<eos> Cancer.<eos> In the butt.
Before then.<eos> Now.<eos> Yesterday.<eos> Fuck are you talking about?<eos> That old-time religion.
I'm sorry, man.<eos> I never liked Phil anyway.<eos> I was glad when you fucked him up.<eos> Thanks, man.<eos> All right.
You slick motherfucker, you.<eos> Thought you said your plan was "no bodies."<eos> But I ain't complaining'.<eos> You do some work on his brakes or what?<eos> His what?
They're about pain.<eos> Please welcome to the stage, tonight's winner, Miss Marilyn Monroe!<eos> I've got great tits, too, but I don't throw them in everyone's face.<eos> All right, darling.<eos> Gee.
Before noon, Lucille?<eos> Got enough for two?<eos> To us.<eos> Together at last.<eos> At last.
Seriously? Okay.<eos> We're on the way.<eos> You are never gonna believe this.<eos> Any terror groups claim responsibility?<eos> None so far.
Allow me to introduce<eos> Miss Jenny Mills, soldier, scholar, gentlewoman and... all-around badass?<eos> Actually, I prefer "Miss Badass."<eos> They seem like a good group.<eos> Indeed.
Clara told me soccer practice went well.<eos> So you'll probably be starting this weekend.<eos> I met some new people today at work.<eos> Complete weirdoes, which means you'll probably like them.<eos> All right.
Was somebody sitting here?<eos> No.<eos> So, how was it?<eos> How was what?<eos> Your night in MDC.
Thank you. Nice to fix something for once.<eos> Hell, if that's how you feel,<eos> I got a leaky toilet back at the office.<eos> All right.<eos> Hasta luego.
I understand.<eos> At this time, I'd like to turn cross-examination over to my co-counsel, James McGill.<eos> Uh, well, there's been a lot of fuss about it, but you and I have never really talked about this tape you made.<eos> We lost the opportunity when you burglarized my house to destroy it.<eos> Fair enough.
You sure? Give it to him.<eos> _<eos> Well?<eos> It could work.<eos> Okay, then.
I already ordered them.<eos> I mean, the shipment gets here in two days.<eos> He knows.<eos> Then make up an excuse.<eos> Fine. $3,000.
Oh, my god.<eos> I couldn't believe some of it.<eos> "I'm not crazy.<eos> It's 1216, one after magna carta."<eos> The magna carta?
From now on, when people think guitars, they're gonna think "abq in tune."<eos> When they think pianos -- "abq in tune."<eos> Drums, xylophones...<eos> For less than the price of that ritchie blackmore beauty you got on that rack, you're gonna have the whole town thinking, "abq in tune."<eos> Yeah, but -- but what about the time slot?
Ohh. It's Alfred Hitchcock in a rented toupee.<eos> C'mon. Why would you rent a toupee?<eos> Y'know, from the toupee store.<eos> So you don't have to maintain it.<eos> All right. Seven and seven.
It's B-12, like the vitamin.<eos> O-67!<eos> Anybody?<eos> I got a good feeling about this.<eos> O-67!
- What?<eos> It was during productions.<eos> Crazy stuff happens.<eos> A long story.<eos> But the big picture...
Now, it seems to me you opened this place to solve a similar problem.<eos> And you think that solution could be applied to you.<eos> As a one-time arrangement.<eos> It would be unwise for us to be publicly associated, wouldn't you agree?<eos> Because of the Salamancas.
So, Crawfish?<eos> What do you say we toss back a few after work tonight?<eos> You and me?<eos> I'll buy.<eos> All right.
Ladies, why are we fighting about the Oscars?<eos> We haven't even finished making this movie yet.<eos> Can we please concentrate on the matter at hand?<eos> There's room for both of you to succeed.<eos> In this town?
It's horrifying.<eos> Coca-Cola, Bob?<eos> You're a bad girl, Bette.<eos> So, where's the Queen of Sheba?<eos> In her dressing room.
Give me the 13th district to run.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> This city has a budget problem.<eos> You have an $89 million unfunded pension obligation for the city's police department, and I have a checkbook right here.<eos> Other pocket.
She does.<eos> She can act rings around you.<eos> But your ass is nice and your tits aren't sagging, so...<eos> - Get out of my house.<eos> - Okay.
After all that time in the desert, she wasn't about to let this one go without enjoying it.<eos> Hey, Bette!<eos> Where's your sister?<eos> Where's Joan Crawford?<eos> On the beach.
Here.<eos> Sinatra's changes.<eos> Just put them in some kind of order.<eos> I'm sorry, honey.<eos> You okay?
This is the United States sex ratio.<eos> Look here.<eos> In 1910, there are how many more men than women?<eos> 2.7 million.<eos> In 1940?
You want me to contact the agency?<eos> No, I want you to find Tom Keen.<eos> Aah. Babe, you're gonna be late.<eos> Thank you so much for getting up with her last night.<eos> After yesterday, I just...
Breach in Sector 3.<eos> We need guards and all personnel to report.<eos> Kat Carlson. I work for Scottie... Scottie... yeah, I know.<eos> Right.
- Unclear.<eos> He's down.<eos> You said there were two shotguns on board.<eos> I wouldn't mind knowing where those are.<eos> - On it.
Okay, done.<eos> Next?<eos> Grab the yoke and slowly pull back on it.<eos> - Right.<eos> - Nice and steady.
You need him to sign an NDA.<eos> An NDA?<eos> Trevor?<eos> - I tell him things.<eos> - What kind of things?
So I can either head off into the wilderness and seek shelter on my own, or you can tell me where the LZ is and we can both thaw out.<eos> All right, suit yourself.<eos> There's an abandoned mill.<eos> I have coordinates.<eos> All right.
Hijacking a plane?<eos> Kidnapping me mid-flight?<eos> They did it because you told them I knew about KR-whatever.<eos> Yes.<eos> Okay?
Yeah.<eos> Wait.<eos> what did you think it was about...<eos> just sex?<eos> Oh, okay.
Hey, I may have a line on one of the fugitives.<eos> Just intercepted a 911 call from an apartment in Chelsea on 31st.<eos> Check this out.<eos> There's someone... a man in...<eos> in my apartment.
My little brother's nothing if not predictable.<eos> Brian Mayhew, on the ground!<eos> We're clear.<eos> Somebody's been here recently.<eos> - All right.
We're on-site.<eos> Unfriendlies?<eos> The two guards at the front desk probably won't like you much.<eos> How do you wanna play it?<eos> Okay.
What is this?<eos> Nez, get us out of here!<eos> I got eight long guns on this side.<eos> I got three coming this way.<eos> - All right!
Nez, get us out of here!<eos> I got eight long guns on this side.<eos> I got three coming this way.<eos> - All right!<eos> - All right, all right.
- Yeah.<eos> - Easy, easy, easy.<eos> - Get out!<eos> - Okay, okay!<eos> - Okay.
- Okay.<eos> - Easy, easy, okay?<eos> - Get out!<eos> Get out!<eos> - Okay.
They were siphoning images from everyone in the place... phones, laptops, iPads.<eos> Then, these were collected around the time Mayhew's accused of e-mailing Iran specs to the C34 missile system?<eos> Stop.<eos> Back it up.<eos> Right there, in the corner.
I got it.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Did you see that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - All right.
Get in the car.<eos> Dr. Whitehall, you are safe now.<eos> That seems to be the only thing you and your wife agree on.<eos> - Speaking of Scottie...<eos> - No. Or Solomon.
Yeah, whatever you need.<eos> Is the Artax Network back online?<eos> Dumont's working on it.<eos> I need him to stop.<eos> Okay.
Simple binary choice.<eos> Did she or didn't she?<eos> Yes or no?<eos> No. She didn't.<eos> Okay.
If Howard set you up, then the cops will be on their way.<eos> We got to move.<eos> Federal agents!<eos> Don't move!<eos> All right.
You are tough.<eos> I always loved that about you.<eos> We got a lead on Cantara.<eos> - Where?<eos> - Queens.
The ocean?<eos> Really?<eos> You still on that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Still on that.
Leah.<eos> And you tell me.<eos> - Tell you what?<eos> - Is everything okay?<eos> So far, so good.
- Liev and Laurie Wicker.<eos> - Protective over-watch.<eos> I'm going to go see my counterpart in Israeli Intelligence.<eos> - Christina.<eos> - Zev.
For you, anything.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Is that tension that I sense?<eos> - In the air?<eos> - In you.
Really, I'm...<eos> I'm not interesting.<eos> I'm in shock, Bryan.<eos> Are you familiar with how to treat shock?<eos> Up to a point.
Step away, please.<eos> Your hands, so I can see them.<eos> I'm... I'm leaving.<eos> I don't want any trouble...<eos> Not on a college campus.
Christina...<eos> Unless I do something about it.<eos> Are you open to ideas?<eos> Ideas are good.<eos> 3:00 in the morning?
Meet me there at 8:30 A.M.<eos> Proud of you, Dan.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Well done.<eos> - Finally...
You think I forgot about those soldiers who died from Sangravan?<eos> - Who've died and are going to die.<eos> - You just did it again.<eos> - Who else have you told?<eos> - About Sangravan?
- Who've died and are going to die.<eos> - You just did it again.<eos> - Who else have you told?<eos> - About Sangravan?<eos> About my daughter.
What's going on?<eos> What are you not saying?<eos> This guy was in your underwear drawer, miss.<eos> And it's not the first case of stalking that we've seen<eos> - in the neighborhood in the last year.
- Your mother.<eos> That a problem?<eos> What else do you two talk about?<eos> Nothing.<eos> This and that.
That a problem?<eos> What else do you two talk about?<eos> Nothing.<eos> This and that.<eos> Cali.
Ringer plates.<eos> Ping Bryan.<eos> - Bryan?<eos> - Tell him I'm on my way.<eos> Okay.
He could give us Dunne and the weapons.<eos> You're staying in the van for this one.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Okay!
You're staying in the van for this one.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Okay!<eos> Okay.
Have a seat.<eos> Bravo and Victor are in position.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Yuri's outside.<eos> Okay?
Money talks, especially in Russia.<eos> Talk later.<eos> Stay by your phone.<eos> - Where have you been?<eos> - Bathroom.
- Sick mother.<eos> - Where was all this?<eos> Her computer.<eos> I mean, where was the computer?<eos> Rolltop desk.
Talk to me. Are you in any pain?<eos> Uh, my chest. My chest.<eos> Okay, let's have a listen.<eos> - It hurts when I inhale.<eos> - Okay.
Archie got hot!<eos> He's got abs now.<eos> Six more reasons for you to take that ginger bull by the horns tonight.<eos> So, what was the highlight?<eos> Of my internship?
Geraldine.<eos> What can I do for you, Mr. Andrews?<eos> Can we talk, Ms. Grundy, please?<eos> It depends.<eos> About what?
What can I do for you, Mr. Andrews?<eos> Can we talk, Ms. Grundy, please?<eos> It depends.<eos> About what?<eos> Music.
I'm Cheryl Blossom, may I sit?<eos> Betty, would you mind?<eos> So, what are you three hens gossiping about?<eos> Archie's Efron-esque emergence from the chrysalis of puberty?<eos> Extracurriculars.
Tear me a new one.<eos> Rip me to shreds.<eos> Annihilate me.<eos> I just...<eos> Finally.
Previously on riverdale...<eos> This story is about a town, Once wholesome and innocent, now forever changed<eos> By the mysterious death of jason blossom on the 4th of july.<eos> Can we talk, ms. Grundy?<eos> About what?
I definitely did.<eos> So no backsliding.<eos> No cheryl.<eos> No veronica and...<eos> No archie.
I'm still working on the lyrics, so...<eos> Okay.<eos> we'll dance, dance, dance<eos> Betty?<eos> You okay?
I was having trouble reading, and my teacher, mrs. Gribrock,<eos> Told my mom and dad that i should stay back a year, to get caught up.<eos> Betty was so against us not being in the same grade<eos> That she took it upon herself to tutor me every single day.<eos> In the second grade?
And on the subject of being friends,<eos> Betty, i'm sorry i've been such a witchy-witch to you.<eos> After polly and jason's epic demise<eos> I was angry...<eos> At everyone.
That family is pure evil.<eos> I'm wondering if the blossoms didn't kill jason themselves.<eos> Sacrificed him to some dark pagan god that they worship in that insane mansion of theirs.<eos> Mom, does polly know?<eos> About jason?
So why dhy't we both just do that bro thing where we nod like douches<eos> And mutually suppress our emotions?<eos> Yeah, but as friends, right?<eos> To be discussed,<eos> Over many burgers, and many days.
Hello?<eos> This story is bigger than we thought.<eos> I started asking around, to see if what happened to you happened to anyone else, and if anyone would go on record.<eos> - I will. 100%.<eos> - Okay.
I would love to...<eos> Love to what?<eos> That's the real question.<eos> What exactly you expect to get out of this experience.<eos> Short version.
I was with Josie, helping the Pussycats with a song they're doing at that Taste of Riverdale thing.<eos> - And I was hoping you would let me go.<eos> You don't get to go wherever you want, whenever you want, and damn what anyone else says.<eos> Dad, this is the first time a song I worked on is gonna be performed in front of people.<eos> On stage.
No longer lactose intolerant, I see.<eos> How's Veronica?<eos> You don't even know, do you?<eos> The things that they're saying about your daughter at school?<eos> - What things?
How's Veronica?<eos> You don't even know, do you?<eos> The things that they're saying about your daughter at school?<eos> - What things?<eos> - Slut-shaming.
I met your music teacher last night.<eos> Yeah, Ms. Grundy?<eos> They did not look like that in my day, son.<eos> Ah, what were you guys talking about?<eos> You.
Previously on Riverdale...<eos> The story is about a town, once wholesome and innocent, now forever changed by the mysterious murder of Jason Blossom on the 4th of July.<eos> - Can we talk, Ms. Grundy?<eos> - About what?
Just filling in for maternity, sabbatical, things like that.<eos> This is my first permanent position.<eos> Getting back to music, you're working with Archie Andrews on an independent study.<eos> Have you ever done this sort of thing before?<eos> - Yes. Last year. - Oh.
Before that, she's a ghost.<eos> She doesn't exist.<eos> The only Geraldine Grundy I could find was a woman who died seven years ago.<eos> How... Where did you find all this?<eos> The deep web.
I know how much you love the Twilight, and so do I...<eos> Mr. Andrews, just give me one week to track down the person who bought the land, and convince them not to demolish a holy house of cinema.<eos> It's a big contract for me, Jug, and for my guys.<eos> Whatever they build in the place of the drive-in could mean more jobs...<eos> Yeah, in what?
Oh, okay.<eos> I mean, is there not a nice gay kid at your school? Yeah.<eos> There is.<eos> Me.<eos> All right.
Previously on Riverdale...<eos> The story is about a town, once wholesome and innocent, now forever changed by the mysterious murder of Jason Blossom on the 4th of July.<eos> - Can we talk, Ms. Grundy?<eos> - About what?
Why can't a date just be a date?<eos> What about you, Archie?<eos> How's life in a PG world?<eos> PG.<eos> Post-Grundy.
I don't teach performance.<eos> I teach song writing.<eos> I focus on craft, composition, lyrics.<eos> To even talk about your songs in a constructive way, we need to be on the same page.<eos> Like, on actual pages.
Okay. I do like her, and I... You know, I think maybe I'm ready...<eos> If this is something that makes you happy, then I say go for it.<eos> You're good.<eos> Mom's good. I'm good.<eos> All right.
- But Josie...<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Every now and then, I want to sing lead.<eos> Co-lead.<eos> And only on the bridge.
- And these guys...<eos> - We're bruiser studs, Mr. Andrews.<eos> At least some of us are.<eos> Come on. Desperate times, Fred, huh?<eos> All right.
I should've told you about my dad when I had the chance.<eos> So, why didn't you?<eos> I was ashamed.<eos> Jughead, if we're gonna be together, I want to know who you are.<eos> All of it.
The Ice Woman cometh.<eos> Hey, Cheryl.<eos> As a maj thank-you for coming to the maple banquet with me tomorrow, I wanted to give you this.<eos> An '84 Les Paul.<eos> In our signature color.
She will, Mom.<eos> And right now, she's our woman on the inside.<eos> We're going to write this story.<eos> Come write with us at Blue and Gold.<eos> The school newspaper?
Thank you.<eos> Don't thank me.<eos> I'm not doing it for you.<eos> See, from now on, everything we do around here is going to be legal.<eos> A hundred percent above board.
It wasn't a big deal.<eos> What exactly happened between you guys that night?<eos> Veronica asked me to keep the details under wraps, okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> All right.
Yeah...<eos> - Jug...<eos> - Don't worry.<eos> I'm never telling anyone anything literally ever.<eos> Okay, good.
It wasn't my fault, it was Polly's.<eos> She lunged at me, trying to get it,<eos> I didn't know what to do.<eos> I panicked. I thought it would be better for everyone if the ring were just gone.<eos> Down the drain.
It's time the whole family gets back together.<eos> Us, your mom, Jellybean.<eos> They've got a sweet set-up in Toledo,<eos> - there's decent work there...<eos> Well, why not Riverdale?
We're leaving.<eos> There was no gun!<eos> Son, this isn't petty theft or a bar fight we're talking about, Archie.<eos> This is murder.<eos> Okay, fine.
She's not leaving us.<eos> She chose to live here, remember?<eos> With a mentally stable family.<eos> Oh, I know all about your family, Penelope.<eos> - And the incest.
And I'm no snitch.<eos> FP, if you don't help us and your case goes to trial, there will be no leniency.<eos> You'll be looking at 20 years in a federal penitentiary for your part in the cover-up of Jason Blossom's murder.<eos> Dad?<eos> You okay?
I'm fine.<eos> I've shed my tears for the Blossom men.<eos> It was chilling, Betty.<eos> I'm telling you, there are some dark goings on at Thornhill.<eos> Well, not just at Thornhill. Town wide.
They will not get along.<eos> - So, you took Polly to school?<eos> - I'm so sorry, Betty.<eos> Nothing happened at school, it was fine.<eos> Fine?
This is where I belong, okay?<eos> Let's talk about this after school.<eos> Please don't worry about me.<eos> - Where is he?<eos> - Southside High.
Hey. You okay?<eos> When we were at Southside High, you were looking at Betty and Jughead...<eos> I don't know, wistfully.<eos> - Wistfully?<eos> - Longingly.
They will be suspicious.<eos> Then throw in a getaway plane.<eos> When heads start popping, you go.<eos> But if you don't leave me the money, you're dd before your foot hits the step of your jet.<eos> You okay?
He wants his life back.<eos> After Swagger has killed Lon Scott, Meachum, and Payne, I'd like you to kill him.<eos> Why the hell would I trust you?<eos> Because our interests are aligned.<eos> All right.
I know you put a tracker on those diamonds. Give it to me.<eos> Hey, Tito, I need that thing you're holding for me.<eos> Sure thing.<eos> Here you go.<eos> You okay?
He was dead.<eos> He had been beaten to death with a tire iron that we found in an adjacent dumpster.<eos> Is this how you found Danny Nasiri?<eos> It is.<eos> - And this?
Isn't that true?<eos> Yes.<eos> When did you see the two men struggling?<eos> - It was around 11:45.<eos> - At night.
We're on it.<eos> I'm reminded of a movie where two women drive off a cliff together.<eos> We can do this, Mellie. Do not despair.<eos> Where are you, anyway?<eos> White House.
- Good.<eos> Get it done.<eos> Well?<eos> Go ahead.<eos> What?
You never made a mistake before.<eos> Dated you.<eos> Trust me, I'm everybody's mistake. Join the club.<eos> I can't, they're all canceled.<eos> The cafeteria?
I kept my GPA up, I had a great season.<eos> I know the team doesn't need me right now...<eos> No, look, Benny, Benny, Benny, you're not the only one.<eos> When I know more, you'll know more.<eos> More what?
Just to get to work?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It ain't but 15 minutes from the Mini Mart.<eos> I expect you walkin' back through that door at 5:15.<eos> Yeah, okay.
No commission.<eos> I'm here as a personal favor to you, Sheriff.<eos> Well, thank you.<eos> Whatever we can get.<eos> All right.
I'm here as a personal favor to you, Sheriff.<eos> Well, thank you.<eos> Whatever we can get.<eos> All right.<eos> All right.
All right.<eos> All right.<eos> Is that all?<eos> We got one more load.<eos> - All right.
No!<eos> On my knees, Bren'in, I looked up at that man.<eos> On my knees, over the black, empty eye of a gun barrel and said farewell to all I treasure... my mountain, my memories, my family...<eos> I support your decision, as clan law dictates I must.<eos> But in my heart, never!
What if he's caught on the other side, can't find passage around?<eos> Could be he's hurt.<eos> Well, this is a breath of sweet air.<eos> You, worried about your boy after throwing' shame and abusing' him his whole life.<eos> All right.
- You are not listening!<eos> - So, you listen to me.<eos> Hold on.<eos> You need to claim this, Wade.<eos> All right?
I don't want there to be any confusion.<eos> Confusion will get us into trouble.<eos> You know, we got tall concerns about how we're gonna manage the yields of years past when we're cut off from land on the other side of that fence.<eos> Well, how 'bout you worry about the hunt when it's done with, and you limp outta the woods empty-handed.<eos> Same as last year.
I've had my share of fun.<eos> More would only be more.<eos> One dance?<eos> With your rotten ol' husband?<eos> Maybe at the celebration next autumn.
Okay, enough!<eos> Ill talk and accusations won't bring back our loss!<eos> No.<eos> Our only concern should be replacing' the meat lost in the flame and finding poor Hezzy's remains.<eos> All right.
Ten years and one day you come back.<eos> This is my home.<eos> ***<eos> ***<eos> Previously on Outsiders.
I know it is.<eos> And you don't come... turn around when I'm talkin' to you!<eos> You don't come in here, start movin' all my furniture around, tellin' me how to do my job.<eos> Uh, hey, guys, give us a second, will you?<eos> - All right.
So we don't want cops sniffing around.<eos> I can get rid of the body.<eos> Just help me pick it up.<eos> Help him pick it up.<eos> All right.
Maybe we should talk, chick.<eos> Yeah, we got plenty of time to talk.<eos> Let's talk inside.<eos> No, no, I like it here.<eos> All right.
Yeah, I get it.<eos> I get it.<eos> Maybe some night next week, chick.<eos> Yeah. Yeah.<eos> Next week.
They're searching for the car.<eos> So what did you do with it?<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I hid it in the woods.<eos> The woods?
We are going to that car.<eos> Why, so you could be seen in the vicinity of it. And get caught?<eos> No, because we need to get rid of it. In a better way than just leaving it in the woods. Like the remains of a pie we didn't eat at a picnic.<eos> We're going.<eos> Now.
Yeah, yeah, I see.<eos> I mean, there is something. Very, very wrong with her.<eos> And then I've tried to help, But, I mean, she's...<eos> Chick, she's going to ruin us. If I don't rein her in, and I just... Don't know how to rein her in, exactly.<eos> All right.
I'm Norman...<eos> Bates.<eos> Like the sign.<eos> Yes, exactly.<eos> Just like the sign.
Just like the sign.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Sorry, is there anywhere around here I could get something to eat?<eos> A bite to eat?<eos> Gosh, at this hour?
big deal.<eos> You'll live.<eos> You can think about the meaning of life later, but right now, we got shit to do.<eos> Okay?<eos> All right.
- Okay.<eos> - Norman?<eos> - yeah, I'm just, uh, just in the kitchen, Dylan.<eos> Putting out dinner.<eos> Everything okay?
I just don't think that you can fix this, Mother.<eos> You're right. I can't.<eos> Not with you here.<eos> Forgive me.<eos> All right.
So what the hell are you doin' here?<eos> I'm dancing with newborn angels, trying to catch a muse.<eos> Why don't you say it like a normal person?<eos> I'm writing a book!<eos> About what?
Tomorrow you'll go before the judge.<eos> After that, it's anybody's guess.<eos> Mine is you'll be moved within 48 hours to a pre-trial detention facility.<eos> Left index finger, please.<eos> Detention facility?
Well, he should be.<eos> Emma, this is Julia. This is Norman's lawyer.<eos> I see.<eos> Uh, is it it okay if I step outside and talk to her for five minutes?<eos> About what?
She made her own bed.<eos> You... you know that better than anyone.<eos> Can I talk to Norman?<eos> Well, Norman's sleeping.<eos> In his room.
- No, no, no, no!<eos> - Girlfriend?<eos> Please!<eos> I've never saw this maniac in my life!<eos> Okay, okay.
What happened to him, anyway?<eos> Arthur spent years traveling back and forth.<eos> That's when he was with you, teaching you.<eos> But he got stuck and soon after, he became unresponsive.<eos> Soon after what?
Everyone's got an opinion.<eos> And I find the murdered to be especially unforgiving.<eos> Were any of us on your mind when they gave you that plaque at the retirement party?<eos> Did any of them mention me?<eos> Or my little baby?
It's Kevin's brother,<eos> - the psycho that put you in a coma.<eos> - We need to talk.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> About what?
A good friend.<eos> Pastor Ian's a good man.<eos> Look, I know a lot has changed, and I can't begin to understand how it makes you feel, but all I ask is that you give him a chance.<eos> Honey, give me a chance.<eos> Okay.
There should be chloroform in the bag.<eos> Chloroform?<eos> Won't that hurt it?<eos> I prefer the term "neutralize."<eos> All right.
So I'd like to hear a little goddamn gratitude.<eos> And then maybe we can make a deal.<eos> If I get to see my boy, I'd be grateful to you for the rest of my life.<eos> Dino, where's Charlie?<eos> In the alley, near 28th.
You come late at night... and always in a hurry in the morning.<eos> It was Jenny's wedding party.<eos> Poor thing got hitched. No partying today, uncle.<eos> I'll come home early today.<eos> What time?
I'll come home early today.<eos> What time?<eos> - By 5 'clock.<eos> Put it back...put it...<eos> Actually by 5:30.
- Thanks.<eos> He)/--' _ Hey---<eos> Your coffee's turned into cold coffee.<eos> Where are you?<eos> The coffee shop.
Bonjour!<eos> That's it...<eos> One fine day, I made him get in my car and took him to see my father.<eos> And uncle, did her father know you didn't write those letters?<eos> No, not at all.
I've to go to the office, mom.<eos> Why didn't you come back with us in the train? I couldn't make it on time, missed the train.<eos> Where were you?<eos> - And with whom?<eos> Sabarmati. - Why?
- How did you get on at the college?<eos> - Couldn't tie them to the pot, so I just gave the manager an informal caution.<eos> I don't know why they bother with the stuff. Never did anything for me.<eos> You've smoked pot? When?<eos> Up the desert.
I'll need a copy of your itinerary while you're in Oxford.<eos> Well, we'll be here, mostly.<eos> Joy will be appearing on the Almanac TV programme this evening.<eos> It's being filmed at Sierra Television Studios in Aston.<eos> In Birmingham?
And was everything all right between him and his colleague, Mr Carter?<eos> As far as we know. Look, we really didn't have much to do with either of them.<eos> Dr Bakshi.<eos> He looks after the boys.<eos> Oh, yes? In what way?
Nevertheless, it's my job to find out how he died.<eos> I can't figure you out.<eos> What's to figure? I'm just a policeman.<eos> Yeah, but you know that there's something happening, right? Here.<eos> In the world. Everywhere.
Rare. But it could have done.<eos> What's it do?<eos> It produces extreme visual and auditory hallucinations.<eos> Not usually toxic chemically, but behaviourally.<eos> - In what way?
And if it breaks, it learns to beat again.<eos> One of the great doctors of the Roman Empire once described the heart as "a source and hearthstone of the inborn heat<eos> "by which we are all governed. "It is," he wrote, "Made of hard flesh not easily injured.<eos> "In vigour, tension, general strength and resistance to injury, "the fibres of this organ far surpass all others, "for no other instrument performs such continuous,<eos> Nurse Dyer.
You haven't got time, Fred.<eos> We've got to go!<eos> Right, have whatever you want. The bread's over there.<eos> How long will you be?<eos> Point on the clock.
Thank you.<eos> Dad, I don't like the look of this row between the Russians and the Americans.<eos> Neither do I, son.<eos> Bacon and eggs coming up.<eos> Nothing in front of your mother.
Back off!<eos> 911!<eos> I just want to talk.<eos> Why didn't you say so?<eos> In that case...
- The head.<eos> Lay back, sir.<eos> - You cut your arm, yes?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Okay. And your head?
Maybe Agent Holman over there could stop talking to me like I'm his red-headed stepchild.<eos> Come on.<eos> He's just being thorough.<eos> Yeah, a thorough asshole.<eos> All right! All right now.
No one is coming.<eos> Just you and me.<eos> Phillip can't beat Ivan.<eos> Never could.<eos> Okay?
Hi!<eos> - This is Liddell of Liddell Byrde. This is Bruce Liddell.<eos> The Hunkins are just interviewing financial advisors, so...<eos> - Oh, so you didn't tell them?<eos> - What about?
Fit.<eos> Let me guess.<eos> Your wife won't do what you want her to do.<eos> If you were my man, working all day so I could stay at home... which, uh let's face it... it was a bitch when they were little, but... but now they're both teens and in school all day.<eos> Private school, too.
- Okay.<eos> - Cash.<eos> No financial instruments, no wire transfer, no cashier's checks.<eos> - Cash.<eos> All of it. - Cash.
So I owe you 20,000.<eos> Take that from the cash.<eos> And I'll lease it back to you for... say, 1,000 a month?<eos> Top-ranked minivan in the US.<eos> Okay?
But I'm willing to roll the dice.<eos> Because you're special.<eos> You have a gift.<eos> But if I think that you're trying to fuck me... I will have to kill you... and Wendy... and Jonah... and Charlotte.<eos> And not in that order.
I played a lot of music. Mostly keyboard, piano.<eos> Ah, I was wondering about that.<eos> I figured Joel took lessons as a kid.<eos> Mm. Well, I wanna hear. Play something.<eos> - No.
- Don't fucking touch me!<eos> Don't...<eos> - Learn your place!<eos> - Whitney!<eos> You okay?
We're going sledding.<eos> Do you want to come?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I'd love to.<eos> Meet us at Poet's Walk at two? Okay, two.<eos> Perfect.
I met someone.<eos> - A woman?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Where?<eos> - At the gym.
It's in the back of Fort Detrick.<eos> Their next pass is in 20 minutes.<eos> What are they driving?<eos> Jeeps.<eos> Camouflage.
Don't know anything about that.<eos> I just started feeling better.<eos> I assumed it was the rest that did it.<eos> And the climate.<eos> The climate.
I wish I had.<eos> Hmm. Me, too.<eos> I was angry when I heard someone else had done it.<eos> However long my list got, he was always first.<eos> Your list?
I won't cut you. Don't worry.<eos> I'll try not to.<eos> Who taught you how to do that? No one.<eos> - What do you think of her?<eos> - Who?
Do bears have blue eyes?<eos> We have to get him back to Eastwatch.<eos> Flask.<eos> Go on.<eos> You alright?
Always has been.<eos> I don't follow.<eos> We don't need to look for some new virus that Arias is infecting people with.<eos> The virus is lying dormant inside of everyone.<eos> Even you.
I remember that.<eos> Remember what she looked like?<eos> Late 20s, Hispanic, dark hair.<eos> High heels and a red dress.<eos> At that hour?
Late 20s, Hispanic, dark hair.<eos> High heels and a red dress.<eos> At that hour?<eos> Like she'd been out all night and hadn't been home.<eos> Not my type.
We have now learned that the president's joke could have led to war with the Soviet union.<eos> U.S. intelligence is reporting that Soviet armed forces were put on wartime alert shortly after the president's comments were made public.<eos> Allied forces in turn raised their readiness status.<eos> The state department insisted that the Soviets "were," blowing the incident out of proportion for propaganda purposes."<eos> But in the Soviet union...
How can I know what he do now?<eos> At hospital, they ask me what happen?<eos> Over and over, what happen?<eos> I say, I not know, so they give me papers to read on suicide.<eos> And depression.
Yeah.<eos> That stuff is...<eos> that stuff is really good.<eos> Okay.<eos> All right.
Yeah.<eos> Spread it around a little?<eos> Yep.<eos> Okay.<eos> All right. Ahh.
Really?<eos> It's okay.<eos> I mean, yes, but it was an accident.<eos> Where is she?<eos> Upstairs.
Hey! You can't be out here!<eos> We were just leaving.<eos> Okay, well then get your ass moving.<eos> Until we sift through this mess, this is a crime scene.<eos> All right.
I talked to Chief and we have a plan for Megan's... situation.<eos> Mark, you know, was fired from the department, and... we're gonna say he killed himself.<eos> Yeah, I don't like it, but it... makes sense, I guess.<eos> And it clears Megan. So...<eos> No fucking way.
Don't think about that now.<eos> Think about this.<eos> Live for this.<eos> Now, I gotta go see about my partner.<eos> Hey, jarhead.
Now, I got some firepower.<eos> And unlike you idiots, I actually know how to use it.<eos> So either walk away now, or join your friends.<eos> Choice is yours.<eos> - You okay?
We're at the construction site, west of San Carlos Boulevard...<eos> Get to the roof.<eos> Go!<eos> I'm gonna kill that kid, jarhead.<eos> Hey, dead man!
You have a problem with a game, and you need me to help, so it must be Mukherjee.<eos> The fuck is cheating.<eos> I know it, but I can't catch it.<eos> So I need you to spot it so I can make him into one of the sorriest motherfuckers this side of Mumbai.<eos> Okay.
And we still don't have a suspect?<eos> Not in the system.<eos> Never been arrested or served in the military or worked for the Post Office or taught school.<eos> I get it.<eos> Always on a bicycle?
Bosch is staying in touch with her.<eos> It's not going to be a problem.<eos> Word to the wise, Anita.<eos> Anything other than a professional relationship with Detective Bosch... is a bad idea.<eos> And not my style.
You?<eos> That move, when it's done right...<eos> Tell me.<eos> No artery spray.<eos> None of that movie bullshit.
Turn around, guy's on the ground bleeding out.<eos> Nothing you can do.<eos> Exactly what happened to our witness.<eos> You want to test my knives?<eos> In time.
We're ready to go after him in social media.<eos> Level of interest in your case, Andrew, is, quite high.<eos> My publicist could help.<eos> Again, this cannot look like it came from us.<eos> All right.
She said yes to everything you asked for.<eos> She's not contesting anything.<eos> All we need is your signature, and, this will be done.<eos> We'll get it filed today.<eos> Good?
Wait, is it the emperor or the prince in the carriage?<eos> - The prince, c'mon.<eos> Keep up.<eos> So the... the prince is traveling through the countryside?<eos> In disguise, yeah.
Hey... talk?<eos> I was drivin' home from work today, and I got to thinkin' about Holden.<eos> He called.<eos> He's havin' fun.<eos> No, no, no, not about the road trip, it...
You okay?<eos> I'm just tired.<eos> My brain is fried from work.<eos> Were you going to invite me in, or... are you hiding somebody in there?<eos> All right.
She's going to give birth to our first child.<eos> I... I just need to see them.<eos> Only when taken away does one really know what he has.<eos> So... you gonna behave?<eos> All right.
Thank you.<eos> Students, you may begin your exam now.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> About what?
What does that mean?<eos> - Where is he?<eos> - What... what the hell is this all about?<eos> Holden, what happened outside the bar?<eos> In the parking lot?
Get off my truck.<eos> Holden? What, you see something?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Let's go home.<eos> You okay?
My life's purpose is dedicated to preventing humankind from reaching too far, crossing a bridge that should never be crossed.<eos> You can help me prevent a catastrophe.<eos> And, Holden, when you succeed, you'll wake up in that hospital bed and you can go back to your life.<eos> Back to Butch and Sundance.<eos> Okay, so...
But it takes a cheat... to spot... a cheat.<eos> Where's the ace?<eos> On top of the deck.<eos> You were dealing off the bottom.<eos> All right.
- the most important thing...<eos> - Yeah. As much as you might want to, don't kill him.<eos> I hope this is it.<eos> He also works in town. Bail bonds shop.<eos> Bail bonds?
- Where's this coming from?<eos> - I'm serious.<eos> Won't that distract the kids?<eos> Not if we stop running around behind their backs.<eos> Or anyone else's back.
Let's do a little day drinking.<eos> I could certainly use one.<eos> Everything okay?<eos> Oh, fine.<eos> How about that place down by the marina?
Are you going to tell me what this is?<eos> Uraninite.<eos> As in uranium.<eos> Oh, uranium.<eos> In Connecticut?
I think you can debut it on shawn parr's show.<eos> Sure.<eos> He'll love it.<eos> That sounds good.<eos> Good. You cool?
Nobody knows better than you that some of the best music. Comes out of some of the darkest places.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> And I wanna do something beautiful with you.<eos> But, hey, look, if you don't wanna do it, then we won't do it.<eos> All right?
Are you gonna give up songwriting'?<eos> No, scarlett.<eos> No. Why?<eos> What the hell else are you gonna write about?<eos> Bunnies and daisies and crap? Beer?
So... I'm all in on this thing.<eos> I'm along for the ride.<eos> I'm so glad.<eos> I better get myself to work.<eos> All right.
I'm along for the ride.<eos> I'm so glad.<eos> I better get myself to work.<eos> All right.<eos> All right.
Thank you.<eos> We're tracking my favorite today, by the way.<eos> Yeah, it's a great song.<eos> Yeah, my manager thinks it could be the single.<eos> Okay.
Since april.<eos> I think I'd better let you two decide that.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, I like it the way that it is in the demo.<eos> Okay.
I'm staring at a brand new car in the church parking lot.<eos> Gave me keys, and said it was mine.<eos> It is yours.<eos> It's a gift.<eos> Okay...
Thanks.<eos> What about you?<eos> I mean, what's up with those lyrics you left behind?<eos> You sing too?<eos> Um... In another life.
We'll do it real fast.<eos> Does that mean she's back home then?<eos> Who?<eos> Maddie.<eos> Yeah, okay.
Well, that's awesome, man.<eos> I'm so happy for both of you.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Maybe now you'll even have time. To focus on yourself for a change.<eos> Myself?
You gotta make things right with him.<eos> It's time, and he deserves it.<eos> You said a lot of awful things. On the stand that day. About this man who loves you more than life itself.<eos> For you to get up there. And distort the truth like that?<eos> In a court of law?
Hi.<eos> I'm Frank.<eos> You must be Kevin.<eos> No, actually, I'm his... roommate.<eos> All right.
I texted you like 12 times.<eos> Yeah, sorry.<eos> My phone was dead.<eos> So what did you think?<eos> About what?
My phone was dead.<eos> So what did you think?<eos> About what?<eos> About the controversy surrounding stem cell research.<eos> About the apartment.
About the controversy surrounding stem cell research.<eos> About the apartment.<eos> Did you love it?<eos> It was fine.<eos> Just fine?
No.<eos> If I tell you, you'll freak out.<eos> (scoffs) I won't freak out, I promise.<eos> So he says that he is... bipolar.<eos> Okay.
Yeah.<eos> All right. Well, I'm gonna go change.<eos> Y'all can wait in my dressing room if you want.<eos> No. You know what? I'm gonna watch for a while, but thank you.<eos> All right.
No. You know what? I'm gonna watch for a while, but thank you.<eos> All right.<eos> Good to see you.<eos> ♪ Those four wheel rolling, wide open ♪ - I'm gonna go walk around.<eos> - Okay.
Is it true?<eos> Ever since the whole IRS thing, my heart's just not been in it.<eos> Phone calls, meetings, emails all the time.<eos> What I'd rather do is sit on my farm, write some songs, and then go fun places and sing 'em.<eos> - (laughs) - Good for you.
It's probably not the best place for a girl like you anyway.<eos> - That's not fair.<eos> - What's not fair?<eos> If there's good music, I wanna go.<eos> Okay.
Probably the same thing I do now, honestly.<eos> I think you can dig deeper than that.<eos> Find the thrill in it, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.
- Well, we love you too.<eos> - We love you.<eos> That's why we're so curious about your life,<eos> - and this boy and all the things...<eos> - Okay.
That's why we're so curious about your life,<eos> - and this boy and all the things...<eos> - Okay.<eos> I'm gonna go now.<eos> - Okay.
It's getting late.<eos> Is there anyone you want to call?<eos> Like maybe someone who could stay with you or something?<eos> Look, I don't need anyone to look after me, all right?<eos> Okay, um...
Look, Maddie, I can't take that stuff, okay?<eos> I can't feel when I'm on it.<eos> I can't write, I can't sing.<eos> I just... I can't!<eos> Okay.
Yeah, well, this time we got security for the both of you.<eos> - What?<eos> - I'm sorry, baby.<eos> - We can't take any chances.<eos> - Okay...
I'm in the bathroom.<eos> My clothes got messed up.<eos> And now I can't go out.<eos> Avery and the boys want some chicken wings from Brother Z's.<eos> Okay, cool.
It's just a big damn mess.<eos> See, that's the thing.<eos> Doesn't matter how I work it in my head.<eos> It just comes out as a big damn mess.<eos> Oh, Scarlett.
Yeah...<eos> And?<eos> You have an amazing band.<eos> They're incredible.<eos> All right.
All right.<eos> I'll tell the guys.<eos> - All right.<eos> I'll see you.<eos> - All right.
- You want me to show you?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> All right, I'll show you.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - All right.
And I gotta get you home, honey.<eos> You can't be out like this with all this craziness going on.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - Okay.
- Maybe I can drop her off.<eos> Okay, but one of these gentlemen's gonna have to go with you, okay?<eos> 'Cause I have to make sure Maddie gets home safe.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Okay.
I've got a story for you.<eos> And this is not something you're gonna find on the Internet.<eos> You wanna hear it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> All right.
- Are you okay?<eos> Did he hurt you?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> No.<eos> All right.
I'm sorry.<eos> No.<eos> All right.<eos> I'll get him there.<eos> Okay.
We know that.<eos> - (chuckles) - Yes?<eos> I have a Gene Buckholder here.<eos> What's a Gene Buckholder?<eos> All right.
Um... I don't know.<eos> We can go to see the music room right now.<eos> Shall we show him the music room?<eos> Let's show him the music room.<eos> Okay.
Thank you.<eos> - (laughs) - Fantastic.<eos> All right.<eos> - Okay, bye.<eos> - All right.
- He did.<eos> Scarlett, when you were doing this video, did you feel like something inside you changed?<eos> You know what? I guess so.<eos> I'm still trying to figure that out.<eos> Well, all right.
You made me lose.<eos> Well, it's better than mine.<eos> Okay, Daph, tell me about this boy.<eos> - Well, his name is Flynn.<eos> - Okay.
Well, the thing about boys is they are completely clueless.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> It's like half the time they aren't even awake.<eos> This cake is gonna be in there for like an hour.<eos> Okay.
- Yes?<eos> There's a fire alarm going off in your residence<eos> - in the kitchen area. - Oh, my God.<eos> We called the house, but no one responded.<eos> Okay.
Is everything okay?<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Everything is under control, ma'am.<eos> No fire, just smoke.<eos> - Okay.
"You were on the tip of my tongue."<eos> - Yeah, um... Let's do it again.<eos> - I like that, but then...<eos> In your... (chuckles)<eos> In your eyes.
- You used "in your eyes" already.<eos> Let's use it again.<eos> (both laugh) In your heart?<eos> - In your heart, that's okay.<eos> - In your heart.
Let's use it again.<eos> (both laugh) In your heart?<eos> - In your heart, that's okay.<eos> - In your heart.<eos> In your mind?
(both laugh) In your heart?<eos> - In your heart, that's okay.<eos> - In your heart.<eos> In your mind?<eos> - All right, all right.
- In your heart, that's okay.<eos> - In your heart.<eos> In your mind?<eos> - All right, all right.<eos> Um... - In your hair.
Well, I guess you're just going to have to wing it.<eos> The surgeon requested some vintage Rayna James in the OR for inspiration.<eos> Well, make sure they get a good one.<eos> There are a couple of clunkers back in the 90s.<eos> - All right.
- No.<eos> - What's wrong?<eos> She's gonna be in surgery for four hours.<eos> - So can we just drive?<eos> - Okay.
This young lady needs to get some rest.<eos> I'll check on you first thing in the morning.<eos> Thank you for coming.<eos> Hey, did Deacon tell you about the song we're gonna write?<eos> The song?
But I hope you believe it now, D.<eos> 'Cause not just for you, but for him too.<eos> Y'all need to know... that you can rely on each other.<eos> - Mom...<eos> - All right.
And somebody lost their car keys.<eos> You must be exhausted.<eos> Let me make you some tea.<eos> No, no, it gives me something to do, at least.<eos> All right.
You're a musician.<eos> You love music.<eos> And you play the hell out of it.<eos> But you couldn't run highway 65.<eos> Not on your very best day.
- Nothing, nothing.<eos> Okay.<eos> The last thing I think we need to start talking about is how we're gonna release Rayna's final album to the public.<eos> It's not finished.<eos> Okay.
- they were released unfinished.<eos> - Yeah, those are good.<eos> - Yes, they are.<eos> - Rayna would not have wanted that.<eos> Okay.
- Open the door, lovebirds.<eos> So, Maddie, you know that you're everywhere this week, right?<eos> - I don't know about that.<eos> - I'm serious.<eos> All over social media.
When it comes to guidance, I want to manage your career.<eos> I want to take you all the way to the top.<eos> Look, you don't need to respond right now, okay?<eos> Just think about it.<eos> Okay.
It's okay. I got it.<eos> - Let me see...<eos> - "It's a bold attempt."<eos> - Let me see!<eos> - "At a crossover..."
I gotta run right now.<eos> But let's set a meeting, okay?<eos> - Great.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - All right.
- Yeah.<eos> You make sure you eat after you leave here, though, okay?<eos> Wouldn't want you fainting out there.<eos> - Yes, ma'am.<eos> - Okay.
I don't know why I'm telling you all this.<eos> I know it's gonna be fine.<eos> The test is very reliable.<eos> - Great.<eos> - Okay.
I'm sorry, I got to take this real quick, Zach.<eos> Hello?<eos> Yeah, dropped her off this morning.<eos> My God.<eos> All right, yeah.
She's here.<eos> My God, thank you.<eos> Where are you?<eos> - I'm on my way home.<eos> - Okay.
Daphne!<eos> She went upstairs.<eos> I gotta go to the studio.<eos> - Yeah, go.<eos> - All right.
All right.<eos> Did you hear how much better you sounded?<eos> Juliette, I'm sorry.<eos> This version is just not me.<eos> Okay.
Love her.<eos> Try to resist the impulse to fix it.<eos> Let her push you away if she needs to.<eos> Let her know you'll still be there.<eos> - Okay.
Your session?<eos> She thinks she knows why I'm so messed up.<eos> Why?<eos> Because living with you would drive anyone insane.<eos> Wow, okay.
All things considered, you're doing great.<eos> Come on.<eos> Glenn, I don't want to hear about how great I'm doing.<eos> I want to hear about how great I am.<eos> Okay.
And it's the best part of you.<eos> And if you can gather yourself and make yourself do it, you're gonna be better off for it."<eos> Something like that.<eos> That sounds about right.<eos> Okay...
What's the best way to do that, do you think?<eos> I'm happy to pass it along.<eos> That'd be great.<eos> I will send you an MP3 as well.- -<eos> - All right.
Every man in my family has been there for generations.<eos> Come on.<eos> Take a look around.<eos> - What do you think?<eos> - About which part?
Take a look around.<eos> - What do you think?<eos> - About which part?<eos> I mean, this house?<eos> Rupert?
And it'll all be fine.<eos> It really does not feel like that right now.<eos> It is going to be fine, babe.<eos> I promise you.<eos> Okay?
Baby, you are going to do such a great job, I know you are, and I will meet you after my rehearsal.<eos> Okay, first: Interviews.<eos> Here's the deal.<eos> Just say a few words about tomorrow's performance, how it feels to work with Juliette, keep it light, you'll be great.<eos> Okay?
Hey, oh, sweetie, I was thinking, maybe the three of us could all go down to the festival together today, you know, like a family deal.<eos> What do you think, that be good?<eos> I'm going to meet Louisa at the mall.<eos> And I was supposed to be at Tracks ten minutes ago, and then I'm going to the festival with Clay.<eos> All right.
Uh... hey, how about we...<eos> Dad, we love you, but we're fine.<eos> You're fine?<eos> - Yeah, we're fine.<eos> - All right.
Okay? Breathe...<eos> Okay, you ready?<eos> Ready.<eos> Happiest yellow, just like you wanted.<eos> You okay?
Whatever, it's just selling out to Silicon Valley<eos> - and the bottom line.<eos> - Cheers.<eos> I need you, buddy.<eos> - Okay.
I know Hallie's hesitant about it.<eos> But that's just because of fear.<eos> This is absolutely the direction we need to go.<eos> - The crossover potential of this song...<eos> - All right.
What do you mean?<eos> I already apologized.<eos> Do you think that makes up for me seeing this damn thing<eos> - everywhere I go?<eos> - Hey, all right.
Juliette, you're the one who sought her out, remember?<eos> I mean, you practically stalked her.<eos> - I did not!<eos> - Yes, you did.<eos> Online, at the church.
- Oh, you girls are so beautiful.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Just like your mama.<eos> Well, I will be seeing you soon.<eos> - All right.
Well, you go, girl.<eos> No, I mean, would you want to do a benefit for them?<eos> - Yeah, that would be amazing.<eos> - All right, but for now, I think that we need to reach out directly to your fans.<eos> - Okay.
I hope this doesn't sound terrible because of all you've been through, but, um... I envy you.<eos> Not terrible.<eos> So much of it was... so hard.<eos> But in the end, I wouldn't trade any of it.<eos> Not for the world.
You made utterly paranoid accusations of both of us.<eos> If you already made that decision, then you must have agreed with something I said.<eos> No, Juliette.<eos> I made that decision because things can only go one way with you.<eos> Your way.
Oh, my God!<eos> Here's the smoking gun!<eos> A final inspection for the solar plant in Nevada has been scheduled.<eos> - I'm so sorry I didn't tell you.<eos> - Okay.
- Yeah, it is.<eos> It's my mom.<eos> I gotta go.<eos> - Can't leave her at home alone.<eos> - Okay.
Scarlett, what are you doing?<eos> You're just making it worse by engaging her.<eos> I know it's stupid.<eos> I just... I can't stop thinking about Nadine.<eos> The fan girl?
You're just making it worse by engaging her.<eos> I know it's stupid.<eos> I just... I can't stop thinking about Nadine.<eos> The fan girl?<eos> Ex-fan girl.
You have no idea who I am or what I'm going through or what I want!<eos> So let me make myself clear.<eos> I'm not looking for a relationship at all<eos> - with anyone probably ever, okay?<eos> - Okay, yes.
So I guess I'll just see you around.<eos> Jessie, hold on.<eos> Okay, I'm gonna go.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Okay, yeah, bye.
It might even be a story in it for you.<eos> Keeping in the mind the edit is still rough, but I was just so jazzed by everything they accomplished out there, and how much of a natural this fine fellow is on camera.<eos> That I wanted to show you guys as soon as possible...<eos> - Just show it already, man!<eos> - Okay, okay, all right.
You should meet Travis Stroud, the writer.<eos> He is fantastic.<eos> You're gonna be at the promo party Friday night, right?<eos> - Of course.<eos> - Okay.
- Of course.<eos> - Okay.<eos> All right, I should go.<eos> But I will see you guys tonight.<eos> All right.
Nothing.<eos> He's not there.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Trust me, I'd know that little punk's face anywhere.<eos> Okay.
I hardly know which way is up, let alone what I want.<eos> I can't let you wait around while I figure it out 'cause...<eos> It hurts too much.<eos> Where are you now?<eos> Uh, New Orleans.
Nice meeting you.<eos> - They're lovely. - Jessie!<eos> - Yeah, they are.<eos> - Oh, I'm gonna go.<eos> - Yeah, sure, okay.
I'm 100%. Well, okay, that's what's up.<eos> All right, well, I'm looking forward to it.<eos> You and me both.<eos> All right, I'll see you soon, sweetness.<eos> Okay, bye.
Exactly.<eos> But not anymore.<eos> We spent millions redesigning our assembly procedure.<eos> So from now on, it's easy.<eos> Well, okay. Um, well...
Oh, what kind of party?<eos> It's like a bunch of kids just watching a scary movie.<eos> Mm-hmm. Mom and dad gonna be there?<eos> Of course.<eos> Okay.
All right.<eos> All right, people, let's start from the top.<eos> You heard the lady.<eos> If you'll sign right here, I'll have someone take your bags to your room for you.<eos> All right.
Yeah.<eos> ♪ To get you out alive ♪<eos> - Everybody walk...<eos> - ♪ No time for second guessing ♪<eos> - Sexy, sexy, sexy.
Why would you want anybody else?<eos> Thanks.<eos> - Finally!<eos> - They left?<eos> All right!
♪ This is our moment ♪<eos> ♪ I'm so glad that you are here with me ♪<eos> - Let's cut!<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> Hey, you okay?
Not much fun.<eos> That's probably why I'm here.<eos> On tour, that is.<eos> Not here.<eos> Not in this hotel.
And then you kissed?<eos> No!<eos> No, of course not.<eos> I... I kind of wanted to.<eos> All right.
And less than a year ago, You... you were never going to walk again.<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> Everything's great.<eos> Stop digging for something that isn't there.<eos> Okay, okay.
I had a weird night last night.<eos> Yeah, what happened?<eos> It's silly, but what I think was a family of raccoons. Have inspired me to take selfdefense classes. Which is very much not me.<eos> But whatever, um, where are you?<eos> In aurora, actually. Wow.
Yeah, since 9th grade, it was.<eos> You always had some girl. Who was sweet enough but kind of plain.<eos> And you'd be inseparable from her.<eos> Yeah, well, not everybody. Could be with the prettiest girl in aurora.<eos> Just in the town? Not the whole county?
I mean, I had a hunch. But you never asked me out. So I couldn't be sure.<eos> Well, what are you doing these days?<eos> I... Am breaking into this school. What?<eos> You want to join?<eos> All right.
I'm not happy making you wait.<eos> You're not making me wait.<eos> I know but I just feel uncomfortable. Making you sit around all day.<eos> Which is why I said I had it covered in the first place.<eos> Well, all right.
Yeah, sorry to bother you.<eos> You... you're not a bother.<eos> All right, thanks.<eos> Hey yourself. How'd it go?<eos> Okay.
Okay.<eos> Um, you going to invite me in?<eos> Or shall we just keep hanging out here in the doorway?<eos> You want to talk about it?<eos> About what?
- That's cool.<eos> With who?<eos> With myself.<eos> - Like as a featured performer?<eos> - In the circle?
Hey, listen, if this is keeping you from any of that,<eos> - I really don't want...<eos> - No, please.<eos> This, I know what I'm doing.<eos> Highway 65, not so much.
- That's so funny when that happens.<eos> He's the doctor.<eos> You should do what he says.<eos> Great.<eos> All right.
Hey, good morning.<eos> How's the home front?<eos> Fine.<eos> Fine?<eos> All right.
We done here?<eos> I just want what's best for you.<eos> Why would you want that?<eos> She was good, wasn't she?<eos> At the benefit.
Aren't you the soft touch.<eos> You have managed to create even more sympathy for the Queen of Country's widower, which I didn't think was even possible.<eos> So, well done.<eos> You know, whenever I think of investing in a company, I dive deep and learn things.<eos> About the company, about the competition.
This is Mackenzie Rhodes from 33 1/3 Magazine.<eos> How did you get this number?<eos> I just want to do a quick fact check on some quotes about your leap into the music industry.<eos> Quotes for what?<eos> A story.
Gosh. Wow.<eos> Well, wish Maddie luck for me.<eos> I'll do it.<eos> I'll tell her.<eos> All right.
All right.<eos> You take good care of yourself, Deacon.<eos> You too, Jess.<eos> I could sue you, you know.<eos> On what grounds?
It's gonna work!<eos> There's this support group.<eos> They're called Hollow Sky, for people who have lost loved ones.<eos> If he's planning on cutting the bullet out himself, he'll still need supplies. Options are limited.<eos> At last.
Okay, what choice did we have?<eos> Okay, you've been acting like a crazy person ever since you woke up.<eos> You come to my school with blood on your shirt, you run off with this Charlie girl.<eos> Yeah, I'm your brother!<eos> In coma or no coma!
You know? 'Cause you're like Walter White and I'm... I'm like Jesse.<eos> Man, you're in for such a treat.<eos> Okay, and... there.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - All right. Whoa, hey, what...
Lindsey would be mad.<eos> This is just between you and me.<eos> Lindsey's not gonna know.<eos> I promise.<eos> All right.
I can get your bag.<eos> - I got it.<eos> Tough kid.<eos> I don't know where he gets it.<eos> From his mom, probably.
You're a bit more street smart than you look.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Our Neanderthal head of security is too dumb to see it, but rebellion is brewing in this camp.<eos> For example, the fights always break out in the loading dock.<eos> Never the bunks or the bathroom never the mess hall.

God damn it, Noah, pick up your fucking phone!<eos> Helen.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I was in the neighborhood, and I thought I'd stop by.<eos> This neighborhood?
- No, that's not true.<eos> He wasn't fucked up when I met him.<eos> You never saw it.<eos> Right.<eos> After all those years together...
What is she, your trainer?<eos> Actually, no.<eos> She's an editor.<eos> Really? What kind of editor?<eos> Magazines.
Big changes.<eos> A lot can happen in three years.<eos> Yep.<eos> I thought of you recently while we were looking at venues.<eos> Of me?
What's going on?<eos> Helen, come on, talk to me.<eos> Was Noah fucked up when I met him?<eos> - What, in college?<eos> - Yeah, freshman year.
What?<eos> Where?<eos> At the lake house.<eos> At Grandpa's house in...<eos> in Pennsylvania?
I used to like to be in his room after he died.<eos> In his bed, you know, surrounded by all his things.<eos> The sheets still had his smell, and I used to wrap them around a pillow and pretend I was holding him.<eos> My mom... put all of Dawn's things in a... storage as soon as she died.<eos> In a box.
Yeah, I get it.<eos> I'm in a shit mood too.<eos> It sucks having to drive all the way out here again just to ask the same question twice, but here goes... where were you the night that Noah Solloway was attacked?<eos> - I already told you.<eos> - Your home, right.
To talk about you.<eos> When you got back to Montauk, you seemed... clearer.<eos> Seeing you, seeing you with Joanie, just brought a lot of thoughts back to me.<eos> Well, what kind of thoughts?<eos> About us.
What was that? - It's Bertha!<eos> - Who's Bertha?<eos> She's the crazy lady in the attic.<eos> You know, in the story.<eos> My musical?
- It's eight o'clock.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> I just need a minute.<eos> Can I have one minute?<eos> One minute alone?
That makes two of us.<eos> Well, he-he gets down when he can.<eos> It's not a quick trip.<eos> He's up near Fishkill.<eos> In New York?
"But the idea of being around those degenerates," day in and day out, when he himself had so much potential,<eos> - and he knew it, he just... - "he knew it."<eos> "And here, in his back pocket," was his literal ticket out, but he may as well use it to wipe his own ass, for all the good it would do him.<eos> Then there was his mother... Sunken in her hospital bed.<eos> Half in the other world already.
It's over. The race is not over.<eos> We lost. They won.<eos> It's over.<eos> Make the damn call.<eos> South tunnel clear.
That streak of weakness, that crack anyone can slip through.<eos> See, that's why you lost because you believe I am a predator, which is...<eos> I am your father.<eos> I am not a predator. I cannot be a predator.<eos> Not in this world.
I don't think I told you that today.<eos> Leave.<eos> Okay, is this one of those times where you say to leave, but you really mean...<eos> Get out of here, Charlie!<eos> Now!
Meg... We should of maybe set some boundaries.<eos> I'm glad that you're here.<eos> I gave you a key for a reason.<eos> Just, I forgot, is all.<eos> Okay.
Thank you for coming.<eos> We deeply appreciate your interest in supporting the Grant Foundation, as well as preserving the legacy of President Grant's time in office.<eos> We're only beginning to identify a location for the presidential library, but we'd hold any contribution you're willing to make at this time in high esteem.<eos> Did you happen to have a figure in mind?<eos> $250 million.
I know who I am and what I've done.<eos> And if I want to take some time away from this bloodsucking swamp, time for myself, run myself instead of being run by people with their own agenda for the first time in three decades, I think I've earned that right.<eos> Olivia is never going to Vermont for you.<eos> That... was low.<eos> Lower than you.
Yes.<eos> It would... Unfortunately, Edwards doesn't need another doctor.<eos> Thule Air Base, though, could use a good pathologist.<eos> Thule?<eos> In Greenland?
- Where is Huck? - I don't know!<eos> Aah!<eos> Tell me everything.<eos> Liv, please!<eos> Everything!
- That's enough, Liv.<eos> - There you go.<eos> Get mad. - Why are you doing this?<eos> - Because I'm sick of seeing you like this.<eos> - Like what?
Sally Langston won't be able to get past it.<eos> Neither would you. The Southern states won't ever let you.<eos> I can't do this, Cyrus. This is insane!<eos> No. This... This... is the most harmless, cautious... prudent... thing you could ever do.<eos> In what world?
I'm apologizing because...<eos> I did what I had to do... What I thought I had to do to win, and now...<eos> Now I am trapped.<eos> Fitz is free with you, and I'm...<eos> Anyway...
The next step will be war.<eos> We lost on ganymede, definitively.<eos> When losers seek peace, they look even weaker.<eos> A peace summit, here on earth.<eos> On our terms.
That's forever, right?<eos> It was temporary at first.<eos> Dresden never coerced any of us.<eos> When did you decide to make it permanent?<eos> That first day within five minutes.
He was never a suspect.<eos> Right. Of course not.<eos> Hollywood Station is one big society for the protection of Harry motherfucking Bosch.<eos> When is your motion hearing on Bosch's checkered history?<eos> Next week.
- No! No, I don't.<eos> - She ran.<eos> Where does she go when she runs?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Okay.
I had no reason to.<eos> You had one.<eos> Yeah?<eos> We found something.<eos> In the garage?
You didn't say anything to him?<eos> Zero.<eos> What?<eos> He knew the spot that I dumped Miguel was where we went camping with Cristina.<eos> I... In my apartment...
To go up against the Germans in the sky with what they've got?<eos> - They don't stand a chance.<eos> - I said stop it!<eos> You're not helping.<eos> All right.
Garland. I leave this situation in your capable hands.<eos> I apologise, Mr. Parry.<eos> You've left me with little choice.<eos> Please clear out your locker.<eos> Robbie.
You seem a man of limited worth.<eos> I supposed you've served him well.<eos> Everything I do is in service to your family.<eos> You included.<eos> In that case...
Please.<eos> Whatever it takes.<eos> Help me on this, Richard.<eos> The broadcast only goes out to America and we have people at most of the papers who reassure me they won't be running with this.<eos> Most?
Priscilla!<eos> You were so handsome. We were so young.<eos> And I loved you... so, so much.<eos> We won't tell the boys until tomorrow.<eos> What?
Another two.<eos> Enter.<eos> Shouldn't you be at your party? I was.<eos> - I wanted to speak to you.<eos> - All right.
You call that clean? !<eos> Chef!<eos> I cannot work with this man in the kitchen.<eos> - Tell the agency to take him back.<eos> - On what grounds?
I was just trying to be a good son.<eos> Freddie, what are you talking about?<eos> I'm talking about your father.<eos> Who were you talking about?<eos> Sonny.
I will not quit.<eos> I ran my kitchens on respect and understanding.<eos> You worked as a chef before?<eos> Hotel Imperial, Vienna.<eos> The Imperial?
You don't want it to be your decision.<eos> That's not the same thing.<eos> Freddie!<eos> Robert Bentley's agent just telephoned.<eos> Finally.
Freddie!<eos> Robert Bentley's agent just telephoned.<eos> Finally.<eos> Where is he?<eos> The Cotswolds.
Did Lady Hamilton send you?<eos> I wished she had.<eos> May I?<eos> People know what you said at the meeting last week.<eos> About the Fuhrer.
- No! Why not?<eos> - Cos it's full of people.<eos> I mean, not "people". You know, "people".<eos> - Have you told her yet?<eos> - About Freddie?
- Sorting through some things.<eos> So I hear Mr. Delane wanted to see you.<eos> How much did he offer you?<eos> A gentleman never discusses money.<eos> Especially not obscene amounts.
Nothing, sir.<eos> I do hope so. Because if I thought you were spreading malicious gossip about the staff, or, indeed, the Hamilton family, you would be out of that door, before you knew what was happening.<eos> I fear she may be right.<eos> About the Germans?<eos> No. The other thing.
Hey, Joe.<eos> Hey, there, buddy.<eos> You have not gone yet?<eos> Tomorrow.<eos> After my last broadcast.
Shouldn't you be on the plane?<eos> Stopped by to hear the final broadcast.<eos> Well, I hope you enjoyed it.<eos> Is this stuff all true?<eos> About the pilots?
Garland, Mr. O'Hara would like a recommendation for somewhere to stay.<eos> Where do we normally suggest?<eos> Well, I hear 201 is very nice. 201?<eos> Where is that?<eos> Second floor.
[stammers]<eos> Yeah, it's possible. Okay, let's come at it this way. If he had given you something, where would you have put it?<eos> Okay.<eos> How's that?<eos> We happy?
We'll swab it for DNA.<eos> - How are you gonna get it?<eos> - We'll ask him. And if he won't go along?<eos> Arrest his ass.<eos> Okay.
Patience, grasshopper.<eos> Moreno?<eos> Ten minutes later, headed back, Franklin.<eos> Xavi Moreno.<eos> All by himself.
She's doing okay.<eos> Misses her mom.<eos> How'd Jack do with that science fair thing?<eos> Third place.<eos> In the city.
And someone's gotta go down there with them. Ooh.<eos> A little Mexican vacation.<eos> You want in on this, Harry?<eos> Check my weapon at the border, sit in the back of a dark truck, sweating my ass off while the Federales bust my guy?<eos> Not my style.
I'm calling your bullshit on that, Jimmy.<eos> Yeah, a little out of my way.<eos> Come on in.<eos> Just stop blowing smoke up my ass.<eos> All right.
Meantime...<eos> Meantime nothing.<eos> Talk to your brother yet?<eos> He's being processed.<eos> So okay.
Detective Ruiz, it's all yours.<eos> Thank you, detective.<eos> - Hi, Harry.<eos> - How you doing, LaTonya?<eos> - Okay.
Something I forgot to do.<eos> Hey, Meg, have you seen Captain Lewis?<eos> Um... not in today.<eos> Or the rest of the week. Wow.<eos> Under the weather?
How many ketchups you want?<eos> Uh... 100.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you, girl.<eos> Bye, y'all.
Well, I have to...<eos> I mean, I'll have to go get some lunch before my biology class, so...<eos> You know. Thank you.<eos> I'm always here whenever you want to talk.<eos> About anything.
All right.<eos> Hello.<eos> I'll be there, man. What's up?<eos> All right.<eos> Bye.
Some girl named toya was up in what-a-burger talking about how she slept with the whole line of lambda pledges?<eos> - Well?<eos> - Well...<eos> Well, it ain't true.<eos> All right.
You can confirm that Chuck Rhoades was secretly directing the Axelrod investigation.<eos> He wasn't really recused, was he?<eos> Are we gonna do this over the phone?<eos> No.<eos> In your office.
Short two million.<eos> Wake me up when the stock's down ten percent from the current levels.<eos> That's where we want to cover.<eos> This is gonna be fun.<eos> Okay.
Consider him aware now.<eos> The same day the U. S. Attorney ended the pursuit of said charges, his wife received a five million dollar payment from this company.<eos> Highly irregular.<eos> In your world.<eos> Not in this one.
- Just give it a chance.<eos> She's great.<eos> She's an artist.<eos> She's got a new show in Soho, in Queens.<eos> Actually Hoboken.
- We covered.<eos> - Short it again.<eos> If it cracked this much from just a tweet, they're terrified.<eos> We can break the rest of it if we throw a rock.<eos> Okay.
Okay.<eos> And wait for the dead-cat bounce.<eos> As soon as the stock's up one percent, start whacking bids again.<eos> It'll dump, maybe by half.<eos> All right.
I am to be the spoils of war?<eos> The wife of a marauding madman whose mother even murdered children just so he could snatch the crown?<eos> You knew that you would marry whichever one of them should win.<eos> This man is the victor.<eos> For now, at least.
So we are not the first Brakebills students to get into Fillory or to assume the throne.<eos> It's a great question for history class, but if The Beast gets to the Wellspring right now and sucks it bone-dry, magic dies in Fillory.<eos> - It dies there...<eos> - It dies here.<eos> On Earth.
On Earth.<eos> My God.<eos> So the Battle Magic that this student learned here, he learned from a professor named Bigby.<eos> - Have you heard of him?<eos> - Her.
- Who?<eos> - Everybody!<eos> What the hell is that about?<eos> Uh, it's semi-not related to any of this, but I think I know a temp fix.<eos> All right.
Now what's required is actual farm work.<eos> Which no one in Fillory knows how to do.<eos> Ah, I think I'm getting one of those migraines where everything gets all bendy.<eos> Please God, let me pass out. No?<eos> All right.
- Mm. There's my girl.<eos> _ Professor Bigby was brilliant, impatient, stubborn, and mercurial.<eos> And a 500-year-old pixie. Who more or less saw humans as children to be toyed with.<eos> If she's as good as her word, and one thing she certainly wasn't was a liar, then her book of Battle Magic will be found here.<eos> - In this room.
I know.<eos> Okay, I'll see you when I see you.<eos> See you.<eos> I owe you for real.<eos> Good.
Jobs are, like, maid, cook, reality TV star... Uh-uh.<eos> I've been reading, and people are making, like, a billion dollars a year off of their YouTube shit.<eos> Well, that ain't ever gonna be us.<eos> At least, not in the near future.<eos> Or distant future.
I've been reading, and people are making, like, a billion dollars a year off of their YouTube shit.<eos> Well, that ain't ever gonna be us.<eos> At least, not in the near future.<eos> Or distant future.<eos> Maybe way, way in the future.
Go fuck yourself.<eos> Really robbed yourself of the sympathy vote, didn't ya?<eos> Let's go, bitch, you can walk.<eos> I have an infection.<eos> Obviously not in your legs.
What, she could have a stroke?<eos> Well, what they do in Pulp Fiction?<eos> Come on, Frieda, you gotta have something.<eos> There's a few EpiPens in the locker.<eos> - Top right.
I especially get inspired standing right here.<eos> - Is this the Merriwick?<eos> - Named after Cassie's ancestors.<eos> I didn't know you and the plant were connected.<eos> In a spiritual sense, very much so.
You were right.<eos> Nick is going to ask me out.<eos> - What are you making?<eos> - Just something for dinner.<eos> - You okay?
But I think I should talk to Mom about it.<eos> That's probably a good idea.<eos> Maybe she's got a clearer head than I do right now.<eos> Who's this friend you wanted to talk to me about?<eos> - Nick.
I'm telling you, from one professional to another, I'm not fishing.<eos> We have everything.<eos> Including your kids.<eos> ♪ ♪ Where are they?<eos> Secure.
I'm going to... transfer some key personnel from the San Fernando bloc to Los Angeles, and I expect your full cooperation.<eos> Here's the list.<eos> [chuckles] No.<eos> I believe in my people... and my approach, and I will not be undermined.<eos> Very well.
There's no map.<eos> But something you've read?<eos> Something in your library?<eos> No.<eos> Nothing in all these books?
But something you've read?<eos> Something in your library?<eos> No.<eos> Nothing in all these books?<eos> Books?
Gotta go.<eos> I've got work to do.<eos> Hey, Amos! Amos!<eos> Amos! Hey, hey, where've you been?<eos> Different places. Yeah?
"With some people you can smell the wind in their clothes."<eos> She sounds... nice.<eos> She died when I was a baby.<eos> If she died when you were a baby, when did she say that?<eos> In my head.
You're safe in here.<eos> You're safe in here and you always will be.<eos> Any questions?<eos> Is this a knock-through?<eos> Well, in a way, yes.
Here's to crime.<eos> Who says crime doesn't pay?<eos> Salud.<eos> - I was a student, Marty the teacher.<eos> After our third job together,
- Before you slept on it.<eos> - Leo frank, attorney at law.<eos> The tip game from an old friend of Martin's who was still doing time and needed a stake when he got out.<eos> Martin agreed to put away 20% for him.<eos> - Right on time.
Morning, sunshine.<eos> I was worried I put a little too much in your drink.<eos> - Untie me, you piss ant fuck.<eos> - There's no need to be rude.<eos> - Okay, alright.
- Mr. rose's cut is 10 cents on the dollar.<eos> Do I make myself clear?<eos> - Yeah, that's understood.<eos> - Alright then, pleasure doing business with you.<eos> - Okay, deal, no Hal.
- Uniform want us to give it a quick once-over. - Right.<eos> Well, drop me at the station on your way there.<eos> Off, then!<eos> Win?<eos> Cheer-oh.
- Well, there's nothing from Finisham.<eos> But he seems to have left Long Hampton under something of a cloud.<eos> There was a death on the children's ward 15 years ago.<eos> - Where's this?<eos> - Warwickshire.
The parents tried to bring a case for negligence against Dr Powell, but he was cleared on the evidence of a young nurse, Clodagh MacMahon.<eos> Sister MacMahon.<eos> Dr Powell.<eos> Can you tell us about Molly Keenan?<eos> - What?
- You put that tracker app on our phones.<eos> Oh, yeah, that thing's great.<eos> So I guess we'll see you at home, then.<eos> - Oh, my God, did you kill someone?<eos> - No! Jesus!
I am, and you're his sister.<eos> I like him. He doesn't talk much.<eos> Can you draw what you're seeing?<eos> - It's hw.<eos> - In Portland?
And every photo is tagged with a location, usually their house. Could be how our monster found them.<eos> Well, her account isn't private, so that's a possibility.<eos> I dug through some old case files and found three other kidnappings with the same m.O.<eos> Baby taken straight from the cradle by a supposed monster. - In Portland?<eos> - Nope, all over.
- This.<eos> - Ataktos Fuse.<eos> Look at you, reading Greek.<eos> I think there's a translation here.<eos> - In Latin.
Hey, Adalind.<eos> Everything okay?<eos> Eve's here.<eos> She's been living<eos> - in the tunnels.
- Who drew these?<eos> - Diana.<eos> - I saw them, too.<eos> - Where?<eos> In the tunnel.
I keep thinking I need to be carrying that stick, and I wanna know what's written on that cloth that's wrapped around it.<eos> - Eve is here.<eos> - What?<eos> Where?<eos> In the wall.
Well, this is a surprise.<eos> There is a third heartbeat.<eos> - I'm being haunted.<eos> - Were you responsible - for the death?<eos> - In a way.
You get that down here.<eos> - But then...<eos> - Anyone else around?<eos> No, it was pretty early.<eos> About 6:00 this morning.
- Happy birthday. - What is this?<eos> It's where we're going for your birthday.<eos> We're going to the Columbia gorge hotel?<eos> Yep, for the whole weekend.<eos> Just the two of us?
Daddy, I told you I can't tell you.<eos> I promised.<eos> Well, can you tell me where the tunnel is?<eos> - Okay.<eos> All right.
Because none of us would be here if it wasn't<eos> - for that broken window.<eos> - Amen.<eos> - Hear, hear.<eos> - Indeed. Indeed.
Ever since the first time I saw you, I knew you were special.<eos> And I knew we were meant to be. "Mean to be"?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Us.<eos> You and me.
It's not what it looks like.<eos> Okay, what is it?<eos> Love.<eos> Real love.<eos> Finally.
And we were in the middle of a meeting... Step out, please.<eos> This is outrageous.<eos> - Yes, it is.<eos> - What is the problem?<eos> - Arms.
Um, I went to see her at the lab around 11:00.<eos> Seems a little late for a visit.<eos> I needed her help on a project, and I couldn't sleep, so, well, I went to see her.<eos> Was she working on the project with you?<eos> No, not on this one.
Reported at 5:18 a.m. by a passerby who called 911, but did not stop due to Mr. Rotterman's ranting and bleeding.<eos> Judging by the carpet of beer cans inside, the "Driving Under the Influence of Intoxicants"<eos> part seems like an understatement. A lot of ammo. 30-06.<eos> - Any sign of rifles?<eos> - No, not inside.
No, large amounts of chlorophyll.<eos> Lab tech said it was in a concentration that doesn't exist in nature.<eos> One sample from Ralph's jacket had the same amount of chlorophyll usually found in a tree.<eos> And I'm not talking sapling.<eos> More like Giant Sequoia.
Dumping in the woods should not be considered a solution.<eos> Everyone who went missing went missing in the same part of the woods.<eos> Yeah, within about five square miles.<eos> Do you have that list of them?<eos> - Not on me.
Or just certain mirrors?<eos> Well, she saw the skull guy in the hand mirror at the shop, and the mirror in Nick's loft, so if it's trying to kill Eve, we're not taking any chances.<eos> So what is she supposed to do?<eos> Avoid mirrors for the rest of her life?<eos> For right now? Yes.
No, sweetie, Daddy's just gonna help us find Nick and Eve.<eos> That would be good, Daddy.<eos> They're in a bad place.<eos> - Where are they?<eos> - The other place.
That would be good, Daddy.<eos> They're in a bad place.<eos> - Where are they?<eos> - The other place.<eos> What other place?
So what did she say?<eos> This is where I came through.<eos> Me too.<eos> These are the symbols that were on the cloth.<eos> And in the sky.
Happy doesn't interest me anymore, Nick.<eos> It just gets in the way.<eos> You know, everything that has happened to us, that brought us together right here, right now... Happened for a reason.<eos> So I think you're right.<eos> Right about what?
For something that hasn't happened yet?<eos> March 24th.<eos> Dad is just gonna help us find Nick and Eve.<eos> - Where are they?<eos> - The Other Place.
It doesn't belong there.<eos> What is this place?<eos> There's Wesen everywhere.<eos> These are the symbols that were on the cloth.<eos> And in the sky.
And his outfit's a little weird in the sense that he's not wearing one.<eos> Naked in the gas station, that's a dignified way to go.<eos> Well, at least he's got underwear.<eos> What about the second victim?<eos> Men's room.
Take good care of my grandson.<eos> I like his name.<eos> I can't believe we did it.<eos> Two of us... taking this thing down.<eos> The two of us?
♪ For a funny old woman was she, was she<eos> ♪ A funny old woman was she<eos> ♪ A funny old woman was she. ♪<eos> - How will it be managed?<eos> - With care and the utmost secrecy.
- Be this Cap'n Poldark?<eos> - My brother, Drake.<eos> - What brings you here?<eos> - Father, sir, did send for Sister.<eos> - To what purpose?
Oh, Aunt, Uncle Ross said I must pass on his good wishes.<eos> - He misses you.<eos> - And I, him.<eos> - Where did you speak with Ross?<eos> - At the mine.
I'm a respectable country squire now.<eos> With a home, a mine, a family and a wife.<eos> I should make the most of what life has to offer.<eos> Including' me?<eos> Especially you!
We've had enough in recent years.<eos> We're looking for a little peace.<eos> In the Lord shall ye find it!<eos> In truth, Sam's flock have so swell'd already, we mus' look out a larger house of worship.<eos> Preferably not on my land!
In truth, Sam's flock have so swell'd already, we mus' look out a larger house of worship.<eos> Preferably not on my land!<eos> Valentine George, I baptise thee in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.<eos> Verity will be there.<eos> At the christening.
Why would you think so?<eos> Hair? Face? Shoes?<eos> You'll have to be sharp to out trump me, boy.<eos> Did I hear you've been to Hendrawna Beach?<eos> And why not in such fine weather?
Some will call that spying.<eos> Whatever happened to that beauty you once set your heart on?<eos> Chynoweth girl.<eos> She married my cousin.<eos> Harsh.
Importer of fine wines and spirits.<eos> Can you prove it?<eos> - I have papers.<eos> - About you?<eos> In my room.
- And yet he has, once again.<eos> - How dare he?<eos> So we're in agreement?<eos> They must on no account be allowed the land?<eos> On no account.
Now all that remains is for you to inform the bride.<eos> But surely, as you are the one who has made all the arrangements...<eos> I would not, for the world, deprive you of this happy task, my dear.<eos> - May I help you?<eos> - Morwenna?
I would have asked him today, but he left in such haste.<eos> George has been to visit?<eos> Oh, not me.<eos> My husband. A social call?<eos> A private matter.
I'm expected at the Teagues'.<eos> Mrs Teague has four unmarried daughters.<eos> Well, having escaped one prison, I'm in no haste to enter another.<eos> You take a very sour view of marriage.<eos> But not of love.
But... not for the likes of me.<eos> How do you do, ma'am?<eos> You're quite the young gentleman.<eos> Is Uncle George here?<eos> In London.
In the coming Truro by-election, many have indicated their willingness to defy Falmouth.<eos> And instead of voting for his candidate, vote for yours?<eos> We both agree change is long overdue.<eos> - With the right man in place...<eos> - The right man?
They're bogus.<eos> They're not connected, just like this one.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I knew it was too good to be true.<eos> All right.
Great place to buy box cutters...<eos> Did you tell Gus you didn't wanna move in together?<eos> Yeah, that's what I can't really talk about.<eos> Or hope he gets freaked out and spontaneously confesses.<eos> Okay.
Dinner's still warm.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I'm not hungry.<eos> So... did you get a chance to say anything to him yet<eos> - about the Stroh report?
- Couldn't explain.<eos> No, it made sense for us to conclude Mr. Jacobs' services with a settlement that kept our customers from worrying about one person's speculative misbehavior.<eos> Yeah, well, about this settlement with Mr. Jacobs.<eos> How much money we talking about?<eos> In the neighborhood of $50,000.
I didn't want to say that.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> But your computer was returned?<eos> Yes.<eos> Finally.
- Dean, hold on.<eos> I didn't know how to talk to anybody about it.<eos> Dean, hold on.<eos> I-I tried to keep this secret, but...<eos> Okay.
And I'm a Cody, too.<eos> Come on in here.<eos> We're gonna try a new lager.<eos> You all right?<eos> You okay?
Come on in here.<eos> We're gonna try a new lager.<eos> You all right?<eos> You okay?<eos> You okay?
Where'd the hell that guy come from?<eos> - You good?<eos> - We gotta go.<eos> We got to go.<eos> Good?
You don't hop my fence and tell me to get in a car.<eos> He's running out of time.<eos> You get it?<eos> So whatever shit went on between you, you're gonna come say goodbye.<eos> On my own terms.
What happened to clean up and take a shower so we can start talking about the yacht?<eos> - I was going to!<eos> - You were gonna?<eos> - Yeah!<eos> - Okay.
I tried to give it back. I really did, remember? Genesis wouldn't leave.<eos> Excuse me. Um, I'm sorry.<eos> Come on.<eos> Go on. Okay. Get it over with.<eos> Yes. Sorry.
Cassidy's working on it.<eos> We'll see. I trust him.<eos> Got a few hours. You want to hit the tables?<eos> Our whole entire town just blew up, Jesse.<eos> Okay. What then?
I know, right?<eos> We're getting married.<eos> Yeah, we all are.<eos> Good crazy, though, right?<eos> Awesome crazy.
But I think it was meant for something.<eos> Like what? I said it before.<eos> Told you back in annville.<eos> It was meant for me. Here she comes.<eos> You okay?
- That's great.<eos> We are definitely short-handed right now.<eos> Are you a lawyer?<eos> Not exactly.<eos> Okay?
I'm glad.<eos> What's on your mind?<eos> Been out job-hunting all day.<eos> Nice.<eos> What kind of work?
What's on your mind?<eos> Been out job-hunting all day.<eos> Nice.<eos> What kind of work?<eos> Legal clinics.
I don't care what it means.<eos> And just to make it absolutely clear, in case there is any doubt, if by some miracle the hand of God touches me and I'm somehow able to practice law again, this is the last place that I am ever coming back to.<eos> - Mike... - Stop messing with my life!<eos> Harvey. I'm glad you're here. I was just gonna come talk to you.<eos> What for?
the most amazing legal secretary in the history of everything.<eos> - Benjamin, that's the sweetest thing<eos> - Okay, but you said it about yourself two weeks ago.<eos> - That I did.<eos> - In that case,
TheDonna:<eos> If by friend, youmean- of course you can, Rachel.<eos> What do you need?<eos> - So let me get this straight, you're in love with a woman that you've known for about ten minutes. She's having another man's baby, and yet, you're gonna marry her, and raise it as your own.<eos> - In a nutshell.
But I've learned not to look a gift horse in the mouth.<eos> You have to find her as quickly as possible.<eos> I'm on it.<eos> I can access our full surveillance network, we'll find her face...<eos> - And as quietly as possible.
- What's happening?<eos> - I should have warned you.<eos> Shawn only cares about cold hard facts.<eos> If he detects any feelings in your voice, he retreats into a cocoon, so what we need to do now is just be very still and very quiet.<eos> Finally.
I'm Janet.<eos> Hello, Mindy.<eos> My name is Beadie.<eos> I'm from the Good Place, and welcome to your first day<eos> - in the afterlife.
I'll miss you too, you sexy skyscraper.<eos> All right, ready to go?<eos> Let's grab Michael.<eos> Come in.<eos> Hi, guys.
- Great.<eos> - All right, thanks, hun.<eos> - Yeah, all right, bye.<eos> Hey, did the meeting with the Saudis get moved to today?<eos> Yes, 3:00 p.m.
Let me show you how to hold it.<eos> Now, you grip it with your left hand here, all right, and you get the butt of the rifle right into your shoulder, just like that.<eos> That's how you brace yourself, okay?<eos> Now, the safety's on, but you never put your finger on the trigger until you're ready to take your shot, okay?<eos> All right.
Dad.<eos> Dad, Dad.<eos> Look.<eos> Get down, get down, get down.<eos> All right.
All right.<eos> Chamber your round.<eos> All right, take a deep breath.<eos> And when you're ready, it's all you.<eos> Okay.
Do something.<eos> Hey, wake up!<eos> Wake up!<eos> There's bandages and gauze in my bag.<eos> All right.
All right.<eos> This is gonna hurt.<eos> He's all right.<eos> How are you doing?<eos> Yeah, all right.
All right, all right, all right.<eos> He says he knows where my key landed.<eos> I need that key more than you can understand.<eos> There's gonna be cops all over that place any minute now, so I gotta get there.<eos> All right, all right, all right.
Dottie!<eos> It's okay, buddy.<eos> Just hop in the back seat, okay?<eos> Buckle up, kiddo.<eos> Okay.
Thank you.<eos> All right, buddy, you're gonna stay here.<eos> I'll be right back, okay?<eos> Just keep the doors locked, and if you see anything, honk as loud as you can, okay?<eos> All right.
Nobody else saw this?<eos> Nobody else heard this, nobody heard any fuckin' gunshot?<eos> All right, listen.<eos> Danny and I never came back to the cabin this morning, got it?<eos> - Okay.
and that's what he was doing when Officer Richie arrived.<eos> This is Officer Tom Davies.<eos> One of my best and brightest.<eos> He'll take care of anything you need until you find your son.<eos> All right.
We got a Mabel Fantion.<eos> Her primary contact is daughter, Adele Fantion.<eos> Anybody home?<eos> Drop that gun now.<eos> On the floor, now!
Laura knew that Will was at the post office, which means Richie probably knows now, too.<eos> So is that where we should go?<eos> No, look, look.<eos> One mile due north of the mill run and Grugen Hollow intersection, we go here.<eos> Okay.
- Love you, too.<eos> Go do it.<eos> Come on, let's go, now!<eos> All right, now lay down.<eos> Okay.
Come on, let's go, now!<eos> All right, now lay down.<eos> Okay.<eos> Richie, get that kid!<eos> - Okay!
And the Church will deal with it swiftly<eos> - and harshly.<eos> - Stop playing the prude, Leeza.<eos> These laws are not enforced, not really, or half the court would be punished.<eos> In France.
Release me!<eos> This is not what it appears!<eos> I've given it thought, James.<eos> You should not be here.<eos> Not in my home.
You may have intruded on my holiday, Lord Darnley, but I will not let you spoil it with business.<eos> Although I am curious.<eos> Have you already named our children?<eos> Or did you leave at least that part for me? Well, I hope one of them will be called James.<eos> After our father.
Have you already named our children?<eos> Or did you leave at least that part for me? Well, I hope one of them will be called James.<eos> After our father.<eos> - You must be Lord Darnley.<eos> - Indeed.
I'm thinking of you.<eos> Of carrying on your legacy.<eos> Mary, people die all the time.<eos> Women more so of illness, childbirth...<eos> Assassination?
And he plotted to have me killed.<eos> I am generous but only to a point.<eos> In the matter of the Crown Matrimonial, I will not yield.<eos> I hadn't realized your painful history with regard to this.<eos> All right.
- Which restaurant was that?<eos> Uh, it was the only one on that side of the island.<eos> Uh, Harbor Grill?<eos> Hopefully, Harbor Grill's online.<eos> About what time?
Uh, it was the only one on that side of the island.<eos> Uh, Harbor Grill?<eos> Hopefully, Harbor Grill's online.<eos> About what time?<eos> A little after 7.
- Order.<eos> - I love my son.<eos> - I said order.<eos> - Tom was poison.<eos> - Counsel.
'Scuse me. Lookin' for god.<eos> You seen god?<eos> Bar's closed, buddy. Time to go.<eos> You seen god?<eos> In New Orleans?
- I'm married... To a woman.<eos> - I have a boyfriend.<eos> But he's on another continent, so... It doesn't count.<eos> And where is your wife?<eos> - On another planet.
- No, I didn't.<eos> I guess I should have also mentioned the prison thing.<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> - I was in prison my entire childhood.<eos> An emotional prison.
Let's shoop the shoop.<eos> Show me the sexy. Come on.<eos> Give me sexy.<eos> Honey, think of something sexy, huh?<eos> - Like what?
No one knows why.<eos> Put your hand on your chin.<eos> Not like you're stroking a beard.<eos> Like you're thinking, thinking filthy thoughts.<eos> Like wieners!
- We got a lot.<eos> - Can we talk about this star for a second?<eos> - Yeah, go ahead.<eos> It's got the best acoustics on the entire planet.<eos> - You good, Sandy?
You're gonna be a legend.<eos> Brightest star out there.<eos> Legend has it he stayed in that car and cried for... six hours?<eos> Someone called child services 'cause they thought a little girl was in trouble.<eos> - Yeah. - In a car.
- After Clive's party... - Mmm-hmm. - ...you put on the ugly duckling hat...<eos> - Oh, gosh.<eos> ...and you remind yourself where you came from.<eos> Not on this hair.<eos> - Like we... Nope, not on your hair.
- I really wish I could, Sandy.<eos> - Hey, just meat, right?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Just meat.
It's quite easy.<eos> I'll take out the big stick 'cause it's fun to hit 'em far.<eos> It's always good to warm up a little bit. Ow! Okay.<eos> I got actually a little problem in the back.<eos> - You okay? - Yeah.
Okay, Rachel's gone.<eos> I don't want any bullshit. You're telling me that no matter what we do,<eos> Rachel's getting into the Bar?<eos> What I'm telling you is if she doesn't get in, that asshole isn't gonna be the one that stopped her.<eos> Okay.
Or getting surprised?<eos> All right, okay. How about this?<eos> Can you get us dinner reservations.<eos> For tomorrow night at serve? At..<eos> At serve?
This "beep, beep, beep!" it's making me little paranoid.<eos> Yeah, I'm sure that's what was making you paranoid.<eos> That beacon's still sending a signal? Seems to be.<eos> Doesn't look like anyone's followed up on it.<eos> Well, so far.
I'm just gonna go and change these clothes.<eos> Be right back.<eos> Andy. What's going on?<eos> Whoa. Tonight?<eos> At serve?
Something private, intimate.<eos> Definitely not in the middle of a murder investigation.<eos> Well, I can't wait much longer, okay?<eos> This ring is burning a hole in my pocket.<eos> Okay, okay, all right.
Especially when he started stealing from me.<eos> Strange thing was that the last time I saw him, he looked better.<eos> He even talked about applying for a job.<eos> Did he tell you where?<eos> Somewhere in town.
Strange thing was that the last time I saw him, he looked better.<eos> He even talked about applying for a job.<eos> Did he tell you where?<eos> Somewhere in town.<eos> On the factory floor.
- Aye, it'll be in the office.<eos> Just come round.<eos> So much for being homeless.<eos> For a job, might have put down any old address.<eos> A bit out of the way, though.
He was hitching by the Blue House roundabout.<eos> - What time was this?<eos> - Around nine o'clock Wednesday evening.<eos> So where did you drop him?<eos> Hedgeley Services.
He comes home, finds his wife with her bags packed.<eos> He gets a shotgun from this cupboard.<eos> Forensics found the slug cases in the hallway.<eos> And her body was found?<eos> - Bottom of the stairs.
Puts Jeb Branning in the frame.<eos> So who was the other intruder, hm?<eos> Nah, Jeb Branning's a loner, one man and his dog.<eos> And that ring, if that was your wife's, you'd recognise it, wouldn't you?<eos> After 13 years?
A 13-year-old homicide?<eos> Unless you don't think you're up for the challenge?<eos> No, no. Challenge duly noted. Count me in.<eos> Thanks, Tony.<eos> All right.
Well, charge him with obstructing a murder enquiry.<eos> And in the meantime, let's have a look at Eddie Thurston's conviction, because I think there's a connection to Nathan Weaver.<eos> I told you, we are wasting our time with Eddie Thurston!<eos> Well, you're just gonna have to indulge me, Kenny.<eos> Fine!
It's all in the log.<eos> But I must confess to being a tad puzzled.<eos> Now, here, look at this.<eos> Here's the initial photos taken at the scene here.<eos> The sitting room.
You send him packing with a flea in his ear.<eos> Did he find something to tie you to Laura Thurston's murder?<eos> I had nothing to do with her murder.<eos> And can you see why I find that hard to believe?<eos> All right!
That doesn't mean I killed him.<eos> Ah, you admit you were there, then?<eos> And then you went after Kelly to shut her up, didn't you?<eos> Because you were worried how much Nathan might have told her.<eos> - About what?
Ah, you admit you were there, then?<eos> And then you went after Kelly to shut her up, didn't you?<eos> Because you were worried how much Nathan might have told her.<eos> - About what?<eos> - The China Farm murder.
'Cause we're in a fight. But I...<eos> Anyway, this woman last night? She told me about some secret organization with designs on world domination?<eos> You know about that?<eos> Yeah. Sure, which one? Is it z.O.G.?<eos> Rosicrucians, reptilians?
Speak English. English!<eos> What is wrong with you?<eos> Hello.<eos> How was your chat with superintendent mannering?<eos> Fine.
Connected guy in New Orleans looking for some general sub-contract stuff.<eos> And then, if you're asking, my first choice, there's this little Jew bastard down in Houston...<eos> - No. - Hold on.<eos> Let me finish.<eos> No way. Absolutely not.
- Claimed she was a source.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I said, "Where's your pants, then?"<eos> Yeah, he was working a story at the time... young girls getting killed.<eos> Always at the wrong place at the wrong time.
I ain't seen Grace in a minute.<eos> Ricky, what happened?<eos> You argue? Look.<eos> For real, I did not see her.<eos> Okay?
Now because of that, I can't have kids of my own.<eos> We're very sorry. Um... but we'd like for you to look at some photos.<eos> Can you let us know if you see him?<eos> None of these are right either.<eos> Okay.
That's when I heard this howling sound.<eos> Like an animal, or something.<eos> Scared the hell out of me.<eos> - Where was that?<eos> - Right over at the Park.
A firm handshake and a sincere thank you, that's your reward.<eos> All right. We should get the crime scene techs out here to photograph that. Yeah.<eos> Which way did the girl run then?<eos> Down 41st toward the boys and girls club.<eos> Okay.
A couple of pinches for possession.<eos> We quit locking her up.<eos> She's too much of a pain in the ass.<eos> So, she comes here to hook up, get high, and hang with the other dirt-bags.<eos> All right.
The sergeant's CI had ID'd the house we stacked outside.<eos> Our sarge says, "don't bother announcing, just hit the door."<eos> Inside, there was a guy with a gun.<eos> Lawfully, as it turned out. He had a permit.<eos> Anyway.
It's bad for business.<eos> All right, those two guys hiding in the church, Miles and Jaylen, they part of your crew?<eos> Man, I seen them shorties around, but they ain't with us.<eos> Look, man, I'm telling you straight.<eos> All right.
All right.<eos> Do me a favor.<eos> You hear anything about who killed that girl, anything, I want to know.<eos> I'll keep my ears open.<eos> All right.
No, Sam couldn't have gone far.<eos> She was checked in during rounds at 7:00 A.M.<eos> All staff report to a fight in the cafeteria immediately.<eos> Fight in the cafeteria, all staff please report.<eos> We good?
There's nothing out of line in his financials, nothing linking him to running Sam.<eos> So without Ellie or someone talking to us directly...<eos> We don't have anything.<eos> Hey, like Al said, it's your call.<eos> Fine. Fine.
And, yes, very soon, your freedom.<eos> He will marry you again, won't he?<eos> He can hardly compel you to...<eos> He will find a way.<eos> All right!
Will strip to the waist and wrestle in the filth "and detritus of the forest floor." It doesn't say that.<eos> Um...<eos> No, it doesn't! What about the end?<eos> Um...<eos> At the end...
Delighted to make your acquaintance.<eos> What happens now?<eos> I'm not sure...<eos> What page are you on? Um...<eos> One.
My children? Are they here?<eos> Where are they?<eos> They are in Saint Germain with their governess.<eos> Then when do you see them? "See" them...?<eos> Well, then... Anyway...
And yet, Sire, I must report once again, there are obstacles to a free and full assault on the Dutch.<eos> Several of our key staging posts are refusing to garrison our men, or feed or water them.<eos> In the Spanish Netherlands, I presume.<eos> In France, Sire.<eos> France.
Where are you going?<eos> Elsewhere!<eos> Did I upset your friend?<eos> She's a little jealous.<eos> Of me?
She would have told me.<eos> So, the killer maybe used a bracelet. Or maybe a computer.<eos> Or maybe none of those things?<eos> We are making progress, Dorothy. So is he.<eos> My goodness.
I kind of misplaced my cap and gown and sash.<eos> Maybe they're at that strip club you went to last night.<eos> How did you know?<eos> - It's all over your face.<eos> - My shame?
Have you heard about this?<eos> We know what mansplaining is.<eos> Mansplaining is when a man will condescendingly explain something to a woman that she already knows.<eos> Mr. Bachman, we have work to do.<eos> All right.
Hey! Not in the cage anymore, Give it a rest.<eos> History and physical and a detailed neuro exam.<eos> Got it.<eos> I'll shout if I need you.<eos> Yeah.
Sounds great.<eos> Who is that?<eos> The troll.<eos> Our beloved chief of emergency medicine.<eos> Okay.
That's way down the line. I mean, After I get a handle on gmos, gluten,<eos> Organic versus farm-fresh. I... it's why I like fast food.<eos> It's simple.<eos> You know what? Why don't I page. The hospital's nutritionist,<eos> You okay?
Your blood pressure and oxygen levels keep dropping, So we're gonna take a chest x-ray. To try to figure out why.<eos> Mass in the lung.<eos> I'm hearing a rub.<eos> It wasn't there before.<eos> All right.
And a levophed drip.<eos> Yes, doctor. Page dr. Rhodes.<eos> We need. To tap this fluid off his heart.<eos> Five minutes ago he was getting better, And now he's sicker than when he came in.<eos> Okay.
Bulky, swollen lymph nodes. And a clear primary mass. In the right lower lobe of the lung.<eos> Non-small cell lung cancer?<eos> The biopsy results are pending, But I'm almost certain they'll confirm it.<eos> I'm gonna talk to dr. Latham about surgical options.<eos> All right.
Something wrong?<eos> At 12 weeks, optimal crown chin length is 26 millimeters.<eos> Your fetal measurement is 23.<eos> Is that still within the normal range?<eos> Yes, but on the low end.
Strong and steady.<eos> - How do the measurements look?<eos> - Give me a second.<eos> Crown-to-chin length measurement is 30.9 millimeters.<eos> Well within the normal parameters.
I mean, not even a tiny bit.<eos> I'm just saying you have nothing to prove to me.<eos> Well, it's not that.<eos> I just want to make sure. Our patient gets the treatment that she needs.<eos> Okay.
No.<eos> Well, I mean, the idea being. That it might benefit you professionally, You know, to see what it's like to be on the other side.<eos> I mean, it certainly benefitted me.<eos> I really can't see myself in psychotherapy, dr. Charles.<eos> Okay.
I'll help you.<eos> Introduce yourself to the son.<eos> I'm dr.<eos> Reese. I understand you're the patient's son.<eos> Okay.
Must have hit the lung.<eos> Pneumothorax.<eos> Let's get a chest x-ray.<eos> No.<eos> All right.
You don't remember?<eos> Mackinac island?<eos> All that saltwater taffy?<eos> No.<eos> In frickin' paradise, man.
Okay.<eos> Let's switch sides, then.<eos> Atrial purse string suture.<eos> Where am I supposed to be now?<eos> To my left.
Wasn't always easy, giving over total control like that.<eos> But you get used to it.<eos> There's a website that teaches you how.<eos> So is... is that what happened today in the car?<eos> - Yeah. - Okay.
Knowing the truth could help her change how she thinks.<eos> Eh, a lot easier said than done.<eos> Still, it's our responsibility to let her decide.<eos> Fair enough.<eos> All right.
Jeff, stay with the kids.<eos> I got you!<eos> - Clear! Clear!<eos> - Back up!<eos> All right.
There we go.<eos> Okay. The baby looks good.<eos> April, let's get her up to the NICU.<eos> - On my way.<eos> - Okay.
She looks like she's lost about three liters.<eos> How much have we given her?<eos> Two packed red blood cells, one FFP, two cryo.<eos> Second patch is on its way with more blood and cryo.<eos> All right.
Mr. Kellogg, I'm very sorry.<eos> We are gonna take excellent care of you, but you're gonna have to wait a little bit longer.<eos> - For God's sake.<eos> - I will be right back, and I'm gonna make you one of our first priorities.<eos> First priority.
My legs don't work.<eos> It's okay, nick.<eos> I got you.<eos> Here.<eos> All right.
That's enough for me.<eos> But you're risking your life.<eos> She is my life.<eos> I don't want you to share your concerns with her.<eos> Okay.
But the rape kit's only supposed to reveal dna. For the past five days.<eos> How is this gonna help?<eos> I hate to say this, But the likelihood in a case like this. Is that the offender's been assaulting her regularly,<eos> Hey, teresa's parents are here.<eos> Okay.
Dr. Wheeler was one of us.<eos> And the burden of processing all that has happened will be a long and... and difficult one, so there would be no judgment on anyone who would prefer not to be here today.<eos> At times like this, talking about anything, even the weather, never hurt anyone, so my colleague Dr. Richardson has made herself available all day.<eos> She'll be up in her office if anybody wants to stop by.<eos> Okay?
It's a tough day?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Just hang in there.<eos> Thank you.<eos> All right.
But he was making some pretty big mistakes lately.<eos> Yeah, and it was getting worse after the drinking incident.<eos> Was there anything that, um, might have been weighing on him?<eos> I mean, you can tell that he was losing his confidence.<eos> Um, okay, then.
Hey, um, I saw you and Tate getting a little edgy.<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> - I'm fine.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Okay, good.
- No.<eos> - Was there anyone he might have talked to?<eos> A confidant?<eos> - Honestly, I have no idea.<eos> - Okay.
- Get this one up to surgery.<eos> - All right, let's go.<eos> Okay, here we go.<eos> - Dr. Choi, you're good?<eos> - Good.
Wait, we need to page Will.<eos> What is it?<eos> This is Bella Rowan... Dr. Rowan.<eos> She was Will's teacher, his mentor.<eos> Okay.
She was Will's teacher, his mentor.<eos> Okay.<eos> Lungs are wet.<eos> Does this hurt, Dr. Rowan?<eos> Okay, all right, all right.
We promise to do our best, to get you out of here so you can catch that bus.<eos> - How's that sound?<eos> - Good.<eos> - Good. - Good.<eos> All right.
Now I know all this is a lot, but any questions, feel free.<eos> Yeah, I was doing some research online, and it seems that, Brandon's chicken legs and his puny size are because of his condition?<eos> I mean, any chance that that'll change?<eos> Obviously, Brandon's health is our primary concern, but yes, he may grow at a more rapid rate once the blood flow issue is corrected.<eos> Good. Okay.
- Pneumonitis.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> This is a pattern suggestive of ingesting some sort of hydrocarbon.<eos> Isn't that in cleaning products?<eos> And lighter fluid, motor oil, gasoline.
The world has become a very dangerous place because of people like you.<eos> Why, even today, I had an aide attacked in my office... which is why I'm sure you understand my wariness to have S.H.I.E.L.D. agents show up uninvited to my private property, especially if they wish me harm.<eos> I can assure you we want no such thing.<eos> But I do have reason to believe that your brother's being held here against his will.<eos> - At gunpoint.
So you're allowed to touch Lola?<eos> Wanted to let you know we're a few minutes out from the crash site.<eos> Did he ever let you drive her?<eos> I have this one image in my head... An early mission of ours.<eos> Maybe in Madrid?
But I hope that May won't give us any kind of problem at all, and we don't have to face...<eos> sacrificing her. Our May Life Model Decoy should get us the Darkhold eventually.<eos> And if something goes wrong... then we have our safety net.<eos> You're referring to the other android<eos> - now in operation.
- The senator had inside information.<eos> - I know.<eos> Details.<eos> It's like Nadeer had eyes inside our...<eos> Our headquarters.
They've got Agent Koenig.<eos> I repeat ... they've got Agent Koenig!<eos> - Which one? - Billy.<eos> He was abducted an hour ago.<eos> Any possible motive?
But Fitz doesn't want to.<eos> You guys got anything?<eos> This is L.T. Koenig's last known location.<eos> Negative.<eos> Just a lot of man-buns.
That's the game.<eos> I guess we should be grateful.<eos> After all the years, all the missions,<eos> - all the close calls... - Mm. - Both our deaths.<eos> - Right.
Probably the same way I'm not finding any trace of accelerant. Has to be something.<eos> Clearly.<eos> And yet, there is nothing.<eos> So, we take a bit of everything and test a bit of everything, old-school.<eos> Like in the chem lab, at our old school.
You must really like this guy.<eos> Maybe I'm tired of dating civilians.<eos> Well...<eos> Maybe if it doesn't work out with this one, you and I can talk about that...<eos> Over a drink.
So clumsy.<eos> Everything okay?<eos> Oh, our, uh, friend here went hiking.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> In a dumpster or...?
Just filling in for the other guy.<eos> how about that story on bakshi news the other day?<eos> That inhuman they found with lion paws for hands?<eos> So weird. Just the paws.<eos> Finally.
Weareaskingyou ,the public, todoyourcivicduty andhelpbringthesekillers tojustice.<eos> Thosewhoprovide anyinformation thatcouldleadust--<eos> Calm down. At least Skye's not a prisoner anymore.<eos> Yeah, but if hydra finds her before I do, they'll march her into a public square and put a bullet in her head.<eos> Hey. Not in front of my daughter.
You may not be the Fitz who was my good friend... a man I'd step in front of a train for... but you wear your fear the same way. Aah! They're fighting back, huh?<eos> Soon, Daisy and the rest of them will escape this wretched reality.<eos> But if that's true, they'll destroy this world, killing you along with it.<eos> Better dead than alive in this miserable place.<eos> And the other place?
There isn't any time.<eos> Look around you, Mack.<eos> This is the end.<eos> You know that. In your heart, you know the truth about this world,<eos> - about your daughter.
Really?<eos> Mexico, China.<eos> They're really gonna send the Jaguars to London?<eos> No.<eos> Doubtful. Not with Brexit.
I am?<eos> Prove it.<eos> 40 solo tackles, 9 1/2 sacks.<eos> Oh, and I like the way you call sacks "snacks."<eos> - All right.
Hangin' on by a thread.<eos> There has to be some other way. There has to be.<eos> Well, speak of the devils and they appear.<eos> Time for their boudin sausages.<eos> 5:15 like clockwork.
What do you mean?<eos> I have to write that paper tonight.<eos> For Dietrich's class? Yeah.<eos> What's it about?<eos> Campus sexual assault.
It's pretty by the river.<eos> Yeah. It's nice. It's peaceful.<eos> Private.<eos> What did you talk about when you walked by the river?<eos> Shopping.
Yeah. It's nice. It's peaceful.<eos> Private.<eos> What did you talk about when you walked by the river?<eos> Shopping.<eos> - And the weather.
Nothing that I can remember.<eos> Ofglen is quite a beautiful girl, isn't she?<eos> She was very pleasant looking.<eos> In what way?<eos> Her hair? Her lips?
How did you know?<eos> Because she mentioned her wife.<eos> From before.<eos> It was... It was in passing.<eos> In passing.
Truly.<eos> Mrs. Waterford, I'm not pregnant.<eos> I got my period.<eos> When?<eos> Last night.
Boy, look at these outfits.<eos> It's a parade of sluts.<eos> Take your hands out of your pocket.<eos> Did I say run, you in the vest?<eos> Semicircle!
It's a parade of sluts.<eos> Take your hands out of your pocket.<eos> Did I say run, you in the vest?<eos> Semicircle!<eos> Equidistant.
Do you understand me, Fred?<eos> You're going to control yourself.<eos> Control myself.<eos> You brought lust and temptation back into this house.<eos> On your back, and on your knees.
Then I will too.<eos> Good morning, boys and girls.<eos> Who's ready to tear Watson Industries a new asshole?<eos> That's what I like to see.<eos> Now, on your desks,
Please, Herr Starr, have a seat.<eos> For over 2,000 years, this organization has been at the very heart of world affairs.<eos> What do you think is the source of our enduring power?<eos> I would imagine a combination of economic influence and sexual blackmail.<eos> Some, of course.
So you're just out here scaring people? For money?<eos> They're already scared.<eos> They come listen to me talk about the end of the world so they can worry about that instead of what really scares them.<eos> Which is what?<eos> Themselves.
Blessed be the pure in spirit for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.<eos> Blessed be the pure in spirit for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.<eos> Aunt Elizabeth?<eos> One of the toilets is overflowing again.<eos> Oh, dear.
Sorry, did I startle you?<eos> I just wanted to say hello.<eos> I haven't seen you in a while.<eos> I was thinking perhaps we could have a rematch tonight.<eos> Scrabble.
I just wanted to say hello.<eos> I haven't seen you in a while.<eos> I was thinking perhaps we could have a rematch tonight.<eos> Scrabble.<eos> 9:00 in my office?
Thanks for staying.<eos> Of course we stayed. Your message said it was urgent.<eos> What's going on? Is there a problem with the settlement? I gave Oliver my word that I'd tell you the truth, so...<eos> I'm here to tell you the truth.<eos> - Truth about what?
What I see, Dr. lipschitz, is we're 46 minutes into this session, and I haven't gotten closure yet.<eos> Louis, we spent seven years on the fact that your mother made you wear Esther's handmeups.<eos> You're not getting closure in 50 minutes.<eos> Well, then what the hell am I paying you for?<eos> Okay, Louis.
And I'm sorry, Alex, but this is a take it or leave it offer.<eos> You can let me know in the morning.<eos> I'll take it.<eos> I wasn't really gonna make name partner in a year.<eos> Maybe not ever.
I was thinking maybe your new office.<eos> Yeah, we could end up there.<eos> But I was thinking maybe we'd start out where I started out.<eos> - Where's that?<eos> - In the bullpen.
You admit that you kidnapped Dr. Ogden and buried her alive?<eos> Well, it wouldn't have been much of a game if there were no stakes.<eos> Here!<eos> Start digging!<eos> William!
- Who?<eos> Julia?<eos> She's at the morgue.<eos> When I suggested you may lose someone, you assumed I meant your wife.<eos> - Who then?
Pause.<eos> Make an image loop.<eos> He had hypoxia at birth.<eos> We didn't know how much damage there was.<eos> Right.
We found a device in Roger's office with a photo on it.<eos> This girl?<eos> That's the one.<eos> What do you think?<eos> About what?
Why don't you come home early tonight?<eos> I'll be here.<eos> Unless you want me to sleep in the car again.<eos> Ben, there's something I've been meaning to talk to you about.<eos> What?
Where would we go?<eos> We couldn't go to my place.<eos> Moira's there, working.<eos> What do people in the movies do?<eos> In the movies?
May the Lord open.<eos> We've heard a bit about Handmaids, but it's difficult to separate rumors from facts.<eos> That is why I'm so pleased we're opening a dialog between our countries.<eos> Offred, what is your given name?<eos> From before.
What did they talk about last night?<eos> What?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You didn't hear anything?<eos> Schedules, dates?
He took New York.<eos> He has God in his heart, even if his mouth is sometimes a bit blasphemous.<eos> Hadn't noticed, sir.<eos> What's your opinion about all this?<eos> About the Handmaid issue.
It's too dangerous.<eos> No, it isn't.<eos> You could end up on the wall.<eos> But at least... At least someone will remember me.<eos> In this place...
So?<eos> What is it?<eos> It's a good thing.<eos> I just can't stop thinking about when we went out.<eos> Our adventure.
And then I really think we should do something with this. Thank you.<eos> I'm sorry about the way I went about this. I... have this side of me...<eos> Stop right there.<eos> That side of yourself that you're about to tell me that you're ashamed of is fearless... and destructive.<eos> And all over this script.
Building your column starts with a clear vision of what you want your life to be.<eos> The vision becomes real when you follow through on your commitment to make it real.<eos> That's what the wake up exercise is about.<eos> Declare an intention and make it happen.<eos> But first things first.
Can I convince you... to try one more time to play?<eos> I'd prefer not to.<eos> That kind of competition made me sick.<eos> It literally brought on feelings of malaise.<eos> Okay.
It feels like if this goes the other way and he gets passed over, his entire purpose is called into question.<eos> Meanwhile, Lonnie has been sent away, called back, and never let it derail him.<eos> He's dogged.<eos> And none of this is being colored by your personal connection to Bryan?<eos> In the past.
It's only Boyd on the flight.<eos> Well, he might make a phone call.<eos> She might overhear something.<eos> I'll keep you posted.<eos> Okay.
- And I grew up with two sisters...<eos> - Four brothers.<eos> Here comes the boom.<eos> What the hell are you doing in<eos> - my hotel room?
- Four brothers.<eos> Here comes the boom.<eos> What the hell are you doing in<eos> - my hotel room?<eos> - Your hotel room?
- Agent.<eos> - Yeah? - No, it's Agent Haught.<eos> Dolls deputized me before he...<eos> He did, right?<eos> - Indeed.
I'm British, not elderly.<eos> No, listen, our system gives us trouble when it comes to opening security doors...?<eos> You mean like... this?<eos> Can you open all of them simultaneously?<eos> Within the entire facility?
Well, do you mind if I smoke?<eos> No guns allowed.<eos> At least that's what they told me.<eos> Feels good to break the rules every now and then?<eos> Indeed.
Now get them out of my house.<eos> One more thing.<eos> Is there anyone else who knows about this mission?<eos> About Black Badge's assignment<eos> - in Purgatory?
So what part of London are you from?<eos> Maida Vale, sir.<eos> What brings a Maida Vale girl to the police?<eos> I thought the force could do with more posh sorts, sir.<eos> Fair enough.
Stop doing your hair.<eos> Let's go.<eos> - Gordon Bennett!<eos> - Yeah, Gordon Bennett.<eos> Yeah, Gordon Bennett.
Is David back?<eos> He was.<eos> Went straight out again.<eos> He spoken to you?<eos> About?
I've got people on the outside relying on you, so stop messing about and get it done.<eos> Or next time, I'll take more than just your wife's purse.<eos> Right, you four with me.<eos> Where'd you go for that warrant?<eos> Timbuktu?
Where'd you go for that warrant?<eos> Timbuktu?<eos> Wait here.<eos> With me.<eos> All right?
There's blood here and here.<eos> The mattress had been turned over.<eos> These fibres seem a good match.<eos> I'll have to check with the lab to be certain.<eos> Sir?
Some gossip going round the station.<eos> You and my probationer.<eos> Thought you should know.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Sir?
Isn't the Homerton Drugs Unit near here?<eos> So?<eos> What if TOD isn't a name, but initials?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Sir?
Vulnerable young girl with a couple of hundred quid in her pocket.<eos> You, a notorious drug-dealer with a thing for vulnerable young girls.<eos> When we tear your place apart, will we find the rest of her money?<eos> My client denies any involvement in Julie Ann Collins' death.<eos> Sir?
Sorry, sir.<eos> At the time, Mr O'Duncie was in bed with Miss Flowers.<eos> I was tasked with assisting her out of the room and I...<eos> So I...<eos> D-Downstairs...
'Look, if the rozzers are giving you a headache, buy yourself some aspirin. Yeah? '<eos> Your wife has that asthma, doesn't she?<eos> I bet she can't run very far.<eos> 'You get it done.<eos> Tonight.'
OK?<eos> What are you playing at?<eos> - It's OK. I'll tidy up.<eos> - I'm not talking about the room.<eos> The state of you.
Morgan said there's someone here to see me.<eos> Yeah, I think you're going to like this.<eos> A gentleman's come in.<eos> Says he's got a problem with vermin in his basement.<eos> Sir?
Have they started?<eos> Yes.<eos> It's underway.<eos> When are they planning on accessing the vault?<eos> Tonight.
- You'll put in a word for me?<eos> - Look, you're on top brass's radar, and CID have nothing but good things to say about you, so just bide your time, be patient.<eos> - I'm not very good at that.<eos> - No, I'd noticed.<eos> In the meantime...
I knew it!<eos> When? When's the drop?<eos> Uh, tonight.<eos> Soon.<eos> Uh, on the roof.
Now, you want to repeat this until you're finished.<eos> So, you're gonna repeat these above steps for each point that you want to solder.<eos> So, re-tin your iron's tip, okay, every several applications.<eos> Blake was on tour six years.<eos> Afghanistan?
I'd also like to learn how to do that thing where you stand up in the water and row.<eos> Huh, what is that?<eos> - Paddleboarding? - Yes!<eos> I think I'd like to do that.<eos> In a wetsuit.
Huh, what is that?<eos> - Paddleboarding? - Yes!<eos> I think I'd like to do that.<eos> In a wetsuit.<eos> On a lake.
On a lake.<eos> You got good balance there.<eos> I do. I do. I do.<eos> Hey, what's in those boxes, huh?<eos> On the bookshelf there!
You think blonde Katy Perry and...<eos> I never seen you before.<eos> Um, I'm--<eos> 'Cause we all look like janky versions of white celebrities to you.<eos> Kinda. Yeah.
But what's odd is that there's nothing to connect these disappearances.<eos> There's Izzy Williams, a father of four, a college student, the list goes on.<eos> And they've all disappeared.<eos> Where are they?<eos> All righty.
What're you doing here?<eos> Uh, I thought you might need my help.<eos> Hey, you're bleeding.<eos> That is a red sun.<eos> Like on Krypton and Daxam.
- Not another step.<eos> Now, one last time, where's the piece of the spear?<eos> Don't make me ask you again.<eos> I'm not telling you nothing.<eos> Very well.
I suppose we're gonna have to do this the hard way, then.<eos> Now, where is the fragment of the Spear that I had you protect?<eos> I don't know why you want it, but you'll never find it.<eos> Mm, well, seeing as you've been posing as a researcher in cybernetic implants, my guess is that you have hidden the fragment...<eos> Inside you.
Like riding a bike.<eos> Wow, that's... that's great, Ray.<eos> Okay, once we find Rip, how are we gonna get him to tell us where Nate's grandfather is if...?<eos> - If Rip thinks we're all evil?<eos> One problem at a time.
If you want him to tell you what you need to know, you're gonna have to get him out.<eos> So you keep saying, but how do we get someone out of their own mind?<eos> Well, you have to remind him of who he truly is.<eos> All the artifacts of Captain Hunter's former life - are located in the...<eos> - The parlor.
You... you were with me all of these days in this prison.<eos> You were what saw me through, just as you have guided me to safety through all our years on the ship.<eos> That is my purpose, Captain.<eos> Yeah, but if this place isn't real, then does that mean that you don't exist either?<eos> Not in this form, no.
He tried to take your powers from you, not me.<eos> We may not be allies, but I will punish him for you.<eos> What do you say?<eos> We'll discuss this after I deal with Frankenstein.<eos> All right!
Oh, that was the thing. Okay.<eos> Okay, that's... Is that like a problem here on Earth or...<eos> Well, on Earth, you know, not everybody supports ladies loving ladies.<eos> Oh, on Daxam it's the more the merrier.<eos> Oh, okay.
Oh, did he chew with his mouth open and tell those inappropriate jokes?<eos> No, all he did was talk about you the entire date.<eos> So he talked about me?<eos> I told him, I said you have to get over your ex-girlfriend before you put yourself back out in the field.<eos> Ex-girlfriend?
Well, Supergirl may have saved me, but, Kara Danvers, you are my hero.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Anytime.<eos> - Bye.<eos> - Bye.
- Thank you.<eos> - Anytime.<eos> - Bye.<eos> - Bye.<eos> Check.
Once you've been adored by all powerful Mxy, there's no going back, see?<eos> Ciao, mio amore.<eos> You've just been visited by a Fifth Dimensional being.<eos> Wait, you've seen one of these things before?<eos> Not here on Earth.
I'm sure M'gann will be very happy to hear from you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So, this Day of Valentine, is that something we're supposed to...<eos> - Maybe we should talk in private...<eos> - Okay, private.
Remember me?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I was going to ask you the same question.<eos> Look!<eos> Up in the sky!
When the Cauldron goes up, it'll explode with the force of a 400-megaton bomb.<eos> The Fortress is sealed so should contain the blast, but anyone inside it will...<eos> - This sounds bad. - You can't stop me from killing myself.<eos> It's in the rules.<eos> Okay.
- No.<eos> - Okay. Dr. Danvers!<eos> And Dr. Danvers!<eos> That's a knife. - Don't shake your knife.<eos> - Hello, sweet boy.
I mean, he was nice about it, but... Yeah.<eos> Kevin's awesome.<eos> No, I was, uh, talking about your little partner display just then.<eos> You're a terrible partner.<eos> - Terrible.
Okay. - Yeah, we get each other.<eos> - Yeah, babe.<eos> - I think we need some more drinks. - Okay.<eos> - I'll be right back.<eos> - All right.
Hey, come on, not even a smile?<eos> What is it? What's going on?<eos> I'm trying to decide whether I should blog my article myself.<eos> Well, what happens if you blob it?<eos> - Blog.
What did you do while you were there?<eos> Looking at some art.<eos> - In the middle of the night?<eos> - The lines are shorter. Winn, come on.<eos> Okay, fine.
Orchestra.<eos> Okay, well, we're screwed.<eos> Deal.<eos> Her kind hangs out at the trailer park.<eos> Up near Blackmore.
This is part of my brilliant escape.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, this dimension has been so much fun.<eos> I've had a blast!<eos> But I gotta go chase down the fastest man alive.<eos> Toodles!
Which means there is a bounty hunter and he is close.<eos> Can you control it?<eos> No!<eos> I just feel pins and needles all over.<eos> - Okay...
You don't need catco's help for that.<eos> Anybody can submit a freedom of information act request.<eos> Yes, but the government will respond faster if catco is the one to file.<eos> James, the whistleblower died.<eos> Right in front of me.
I can respect it.<eos> Biomax is going wonderfully. So far.<eos> So, how did you know it was ready?<eos> Did you, do any trials?<eos> Human trials?
Why is he doing this to her?<eos> I tried reading his mind, but he seems to be blocking me somehow.<eos> Let me in there.<eos> I can talk to him.<eos> All right.
I mean, out of here.<eos> In a more conducive environment.<eos> We have to find his mother before she attacks again.<eos> If I can help this kid, I'd like to.<eos> All right.
I got to go.<eos> So can you get this ready by tomorrow?<eos> Yes, Mr. Donovan.<eos> Damon, you got to get yourself fitted up. Make sure you look good for Maureen.<eos> All right.
You're losing 20,000 a month.<eos> Sell now, stop the bleeding.<eos> I got a lead on some self-storage units.<eos> - I'm not selling, Harriet.<eos> - Oh, fine.
- I'm not selling, Harriet.<eos> - Oh, fine.<eos> Just burn the money.<eos> Why the fuck you pay me?<eos> All right.
Jesus fucking...<eos> I moved my family back from Pismo Beach for you, Ray.<eos> I'm here to help you.<eos> I know you did, Bunch.<eos> All right.
That wasn't so fucking long ago, now, was it?<eos> Thanks for getting here so quickly.<eos> Sure.<eos> - So what's the problem?<eos> - Oh, yeah.
You know what kid.<eos> Ray? They're here.<eos> You okay?<eos> I can't do it, Deb... not today... not yet.<eos> Okay.
The third... was this.<eos> That is some statement.<eos> Well, good luck, then.<eos> Where's Mom?<eos> Downstairs.
I think about it all the time.<eos> That means there's still hope... because soon, you'll never think about it again.<eos> You will just glide along, rich, with even bigger apartments and nicer watches and faster planes, only none of it will matter to you at all.<eos> We never use the words we really mean.<eos> - Like "swanky"?
He will use compromised associates.<eos> You must be ready across the board.<eos> The stock is running.<eos> When will you do it?<eos> Fucking soon.
Connor, this is how you get back to your better self.<eos> I know how much you want this to be different, Terence.<eos> I do.<eos> But I don't have a better self.<eos> _
I don't have clients, A, and, B, it's not against the law to have poker chips.<eos> We went through that just last visit.<eos> Is there coffee I smell?<eos> It's old.<eos> Hours or days?
Yeah, well, she couldn't have gone far but I'll drive around, take a look around.<eos> I'm coming with you.<eos> Eric Fraser, two charges of mischief, one in Sault Ste.<eos> Marie, and one in Markham and two years ago a theft charge,<eos> Markham again.
Family?<eos> None listed.<eos> You've done this before?<eos> Lots of times.<eos> At the range.
You're thinking about the meds, right? From Todd Curry's toxicology?<eos> What about them?<eos> Prescription stuff.<eos> Rare. Where does Eric Fraser get his hands on that?<eos> Internet?
I'm submitting my report to Sergeant Musgrave this afternoon.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> In Financial you find someone who broke the law.<eos> You do the math. You nail him.<eos> Black and white.
You haven't slept in months.<eos> James, we have lost so many already.<eos> I'm not gonna die on you.<eos> I can find them.<eos> All right.
Locked away somewhere inside that Primary pinball machine brain of hers is the answer to everything:<eos> the plague, Titan, Ath...<eos> Who?<eos> The Jinn, the Witness... all of it.<eos> All right.
Now the Witness is no longer safe, which is why the remainder of your days here will be less, uh... comfortable.<eos> Mind yourself.<eos> I've got him.<eos> Where?<eos> Manhattan.
I would argue the states can take care of themselves.<eos> President!<eos> -Well, by all means, continue, Governor.<eos> What... what was that part you were talking about?<eos> Insomnia?
She needed to stay in New York.<eos> She asked me to put something together for this. Yeah?<eos> Well, something came up.<eos> The vice president will be filling in for her.<eos> Oh, my...
Well, something like that.<eos> We could use your account.<eos> No, to be honest, I was expecting to meet Christos.<eos> Doesn't he make these decisions now?<eos> Okay, alright.
The estate, the Clios Foundation and all the holdings of the Clios Bank and family are to be frozen, pending an ongoing criminal investigation.<eos> Whatever were the provisions of the will, they are suspended. I see.<eos> Well, was it really necessary, sir, to choose this moment?<eos> I'm afraid it's rare for a family as international as this to be gathered in the same place at the same time.<eos> Well, what about our inheritance?
The pendant was built to hold a person of Mikaelson blood.<eos> So it will hold Hope.<eos> I did my best to repair it.<eos> Valiant effort... but Hope belongs to me.<eos> Over my dead body.
'Cause I'm giving you pro tips here.<eos> I just got out that dump.<eos> Wait, you were an inmate?<eos> At...<eos> Litchfield! Yes.
I am an active participant.<eos> Together, we stand united, protesting..."<eos> No.<eos> Uh, should it be "united we stand"?<eos> - Like the Pledge of Allegiance?
- Hundred.<eos> - One hundred.<eos> "Got to spend money to make money." That how that went?<eos> That's what I said. Yeah.<eos> All right.
'Course, you put six tweakers on a pontoon boat, all wild-eyed, and racing about, and yammering at once, bound to raise the eyebrow of the Water Patrol.<eos> Not a fishing pole or a cooler of soda pop for a cover.<eos> - Let that be a lesson to you.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay. All right.
- Shut up.<eos> That's mine.<eos> And, technically, I'm only responsible for it.<eos> Whose money is it?<eos> Technically?
Nothing is gonna happen to your father, okay?<eos> Your dad is gonna be fine.<eos> We are all gonna be fine.<eos> I promise.<eos> Okay?
I heard.<eos> What do you need?<eos> While my lawyer works on getting this mess sorted out,<eos> I'm gonna need you to step up and run the clubs in my absence.<eos> - GHOST: All right?
I'm not losing to that cocksucker Proctor again.<eos> [tense music]<eos> ♪<eos> Remember, act normal, and be on your best behavior.<eos> All right?
And when we go, we're gonna sit behind the glass and we have to talk into phones.<eos> But remember, we're being recorded.<eos> Do not call him "Ghost."<eos> We know, Mom.<eos> All right.
There she is.<eos> Hey.<eos> It's my bride.<eos> You're just as beautiful as the day you walked down that aisle.<eos> Yeah, yeah, right, okay, yeah.
You have no idea how much it means to me.<eos> I want you to know how much I love you and that of everything I've accomplished in life, the thing that I'm most proud of is being your father.<eos> ♪<eos> We love you too, Dad.<eos> Okay.
I know how you feel about me running money through there, but... you got my back, right?<eos> Just like I got yours.<eos> You sure it's safe?<eos> Trust me.<eos> Okay?
Trust me.<eos> Okay?<eos> It's all good.<eos> Where's Cash at?<eos> He home?
Never know how many inches you're gonna get.<eos> Oh.<eos> Got you a goddamn blizzard your first time out.<eos> [laughs]<eos> Nah, but on the real, right,
This all happened because he couldn't keep his fuckin' hands off of her.<eos> I told him to stay away from that bitch.<eos> I told him too.<eos> Things are gonna get worse.<eos> All right.
You had my kids here and you're gonna let their father die for something he didn't do?<eos> I don't know if Proctor told you this, but Jamie's fingerprints were at the crime scene, his DNA was under Greg's fingernails, and they found the murder weapon at Truth.<eos> You tell me he didn't do it.<eos> Ain't no fuckin' way he left a gun lying around at Truth.<eos> Okay?
My daughter's room, so...<eos> I hope it's raccoons and not rats.<eos> I'd rather it be raccoons.<eos> - We'll take a look.<eos> - All right.
I fucked up.<eos> I went somewhere I shouldn't have gone.<eos> A whorehouse.<eos> I'm in the jail in Pahrump.<eos> All right.
- Hey, Terry.<eos> There's the man of the hour.<eos> Looking sharp. Looking sharp, my boy.<eos> - All right? - How'd it go?<eos> All right.
She needs help.<eos> Who brought her?<eos> Nobody.<eos> She came alone.<eos> All right.
- Closely.<eos> Before, when the Vardy, the little microbots, were going to attack you, you asked me where they came from.<eos> They didn't come from anywhere, they were here all the time.<eos> What?<eos> In the wall?
Before, when the Vardy, the little microbots, were going to attack you, you asked me where they came from.<eos> They didn't come from anywhere, they were here all the time.<eos> What?<eos> In the wall?<eos> No, not in the wall.
Oh.<eos> I would say that a lot of the colonists had friends or family who were working here as shepherds.<eos> - When they find out what happened...<eos> - They'll be grief-stricken.<eos> - And after that...
The kettle's boiling, I've got a vault to guard, and everything is exactly as we left it.<eos> Wasn't snowing when we left.<eos> Maybe I do need a steering wheel.<eos> - Where are we?<eos> - London.
Do you want to stand here stamping your foot?<eos> Because let me tell you something. I'm 2,000 years old... and I have never had the time for the luxury of outrage.<eos> What do you mean, "on the menu"?<eos> - Is this where you live?<eos> - For now.
Very good.<eos> Very enterprising.<eos> They're all right, Dot.<eos> Strange.<eos> But all right.
- The creature in the river.<eos> - Where did it come from?<eos> - Who the devil are you people?<eos> - Where did it come from?<eos> - Nowhere!
Thanks for the lift, though!<eos> Bye!<eos> That's your house?<eos> Sharing.<eos> Yeah. Six of us.
Are you two tired?<eos> Well...<eos> Good!<eos> No, I'm going to hang about with Simon.<eos> Harry.
Yes?<eos> The doctors had, um, given up on you, but then, one day, your father brings you a present...<eos> Where did you find them?<eos> On the roof?<eos> In the garden?
What is time?<eos> Herr Einstein, wake up!<eos> I wasn't sleeping sir, I was thinking.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> About what, exactly?
But here is the best part...<eos> When you are traveling the speed of light alongside the wave... me...<eos> I appear... frozen in time.<eos> Is that it?<eos> Well, so far, yes.
I'm sure Marie would love Milan.<eos> The food, the fashion.<eos> We could even help them rent a nice apartment, couldn't we, Hermann?<eos> Mother, I appreciate your interest, and I adore Marie, but I'm not ready for marriage, and I don't plan on moving to Milan.<eos> Not immediately, of course.
I ask him not to overdress for dinner.<eos> Eight people on a patio, he says he won't, then he shows up in... that suit.<eos> I was coming from the office.<eos> Erica lives three blocks from us.<eos> Oh, okay.
It's lemony.<eos> It's an island.<eos> Everything has to be brought on by boat.<eos> I know Mustique is an island.<eos> Okay.
Because you begged me for an appointment, and then you didn't show up.<eos> Oh, you're still here.<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> I'm here, but not like that.<eos> Okay.
My idea was the drinking, women, and drugs in perfect balance.<eos> An infinite Zen garden.<eos> Simplicity, harmony between the elements, purity, that's what makes it a Zen garden.<eos> I think you're confusing it with the AVN Awards.<eos> Okay.
Where was she taken?<eos> Tell me where she is.<eos> Please.<eos> What are you thinking about?<eos> Dieppe. You.
Clever.<eos> I work with some very insightful people.<eos> I'm overseeing a special project in the east.<eos> We're having trouble with the local resistance. And... I need a man with exceptional skill to pacify the area.<eos> In the east.
I work with some very insightful people.<eos> I'm overseeing a special project in the east.<eos> We're having trouble with the local resistance. And... I need a man with exceptional skill to pacify the area.<eos> In the east.<eos> In poland, yes.
I don't know.<eos> Hold your report to berlin. I'll see to it.<eos> That he's captured. We'll discuss this later.<eos> You were there. In dieppe.<eos> On the beach?
So the paris receiver picks up the berlin signal. And transmits it to everybody within range.<eos> You sure you know what you're doing?<eos> Once we start broadcasting, this repeater I'm splicing in.<eos> Will take over hitler's airwaves. This station transmitter is so powerful, they will probably. Hear the message in england!<eos> Jesus!
He just got on with everyone.<eos> That's why this doesn't make sense.<eos> Was there anyone else in his life?<eos> Did he have a girlfriend?<eos> In the first year, yeah.
- Revenge?<eos> - Revenge.<eos> If you thought Derek Stoddart was responsible for your son's death, you should have come to us.<eos> Did Jamie tell you it was his dad who was the hit-and-run driver?<eos> Eventually.
You know when you were asking if there was anything you could do to help?<eos> You want me to pray for him?<eos> No, Christ, no.<eos> Well, sure, if it'd help like, but that's not what I was thinkin'.<eos> What?
When are they coming back, do you think?<eos> Well, they have resources, obviously.<eos> They want me pretty bad.<eos> I put money on them coming back tonight.<eos> All right.
I've been called a lot of things by his kind.<eos> The Beast, Black Cat, He-goat.<eos> In that book of his, they call me a dragon.<eos> Which of those are you?<eos> In this town?
He's an older man, he wears a dark suit, he has white hair.<eos> Was he the one who took 'em?<eos> No.<eos> It was that creepy guy from the junkyard.<eos> All right.
Do not move!<eos> Everything we've got on prophetic visions and dreams.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Anything else you need?<eos> Not presently.
The next step is to consult the Secret Histories on their precise relationship with General Washington.<eos> There may be a clue as to where they lay their heads.<eos> Already on it. See, Washington paid the Dyers for uncovering John Andre's treachery with a plot of land.<eos> A pretty big one, protected in perpetuity by the Fed,<eos> - way out off of Route 50.
What the hell?<eos> Molly.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> What happened?<eos> You okay?
Understand?<eos> Then let's go find these witches and put them down so I can go home.<eos> Any sign of a witch lair?<eos> It's nothing but swamp for miles.<eos> All right.
Let's do this.<eos> Hey.<eos> I'm not on the board, what's going on?<eos> ASA Murphy wants to talk to you.<eos> About what?
We're scanning through the rest of the seven minutes to make sure he's okay.<eos> Everything going okay?<eos> That's a nice damn jacket, bro.<eos> Jacket passed.<eos> So far so good.
Yeah, I bet.<eos> Did the drone also lead you up the stairs where you were shot, or was that your decision?<eos> He's headed upstairs.<eos> And where exactly was the suspect when you were shot?<eos> The next floor.
Ready?<eos> Let's do it!<eos> All right.<eos> Where you keep the pi boards?<eos> In the orange case.
So, are you excited to get into that ring tonight. And face off against your brother like two sexy warriors, the sweat glistening off...<eos> That's enough, Marion.<eos> It's just a charity exhibition. All good fun.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> Okay, fine.
Since the last time we were together, actually.<eos> Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to the People's Gala main event.<eos> It's Prince versus Prince, brother versus brother, in a true Battle Royale!<eos> In the White Corner, his Royal Highness, Prince Robert Henstridge!<eos> And in the Red Corner,
- We're not waiting. We're just sitting.<eos> Galina... I want to take you to the Georgian restaurant tonight.<eos> They have the greatest chakapuli.<eos> We're going to a party.<eos> After, then.
Carry on.<eos> No, wait.<eos> I remember now.<eos> You that hostage with the heels.<eos> These heels.
Good night, room.<eos> Good night, moon.<eos> Good night, spoon.<eos> Good night, mean and good night, nice.<eos> Good night, human pinky toe mice.
There's a dead or dying guard.<eos> -Wait.<eos> Wait. -Good night.<eos> Dead guard?<eos> Over in the next bed.
Get... the fuck... out of my way!<eos> Spread the word. This bathroom is off-limits for at least an hour.<eos> You know, if I close my eyes, this is exactly like the Serenity Day Spa in Utica.<eos> Except for the faint notes of shit and piss in the air.<eos> Utica?
You know, it is a little known fact about Connecticut - that we actually also have a Utica.<eos> - Mmm. Yeah, it's near New Haven.<eos> Well, now, aren't you just a little bundle of Connecticut trivia?<eos> I kill at trivia night.<eos> In Connecticut.
- Mmm. Yeah, it's near New Haven.<eos> Well, now, aren't you just a little bundle of Connecticut trivia?<eos> I kill at trivia night.<eos> In Connecticut.<eos> Specifically in Connecticut.
You got to tell him. He'll believe you.<eos> It's not a matter of him believing me or not.<eos> And?<eos> Mr. Caputo is gonna tell the governor no hostages until all our demands are met, especially CO Bayley in jailey.<eos> In jail. Shit!
I felt like a million.<eos> Yes.<eos> I went back to the office to see if I had any mail.<eos> Well, what do you mean they don't match?<eos> In my home state?
I've got to see it for myself.<eos> There's a car in the driveway.<eos> Where are the keys?<eos> They're in my pocket.<eos> The other pocket.
You ready to go?<eos> You got some other clothes upstairs, or you fancy keeping that bulletriddled look?<eos> I'll go change.<eos> Okay, let's go shopping.<eos> All righty.
- It's good to see you, Minister.<eos> - You're doing a fine job.<eos> It's a privilege working with these people.<eos> - You haven't had any issues?<eos> - No, not at all.
That means... - tit grabs... - Tit grabs?<eos> Cunt punches, shrinky dinks. That move that looks like a catfight, but fancy.<eos> Did I say cunt punches?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Okay, good.
Ladies... we're gonna go through the basics, so, you need to focus.<eos> You heard the big man.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> First up, forward rolls.<eos> - Just like preschool.
You heard the big man.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> First up, forward rolls.<eos> - Just like preschool.<eos> Not like preschool.
Premenstrual Syndrome.<eos> She gets moody. And now she needs a nap.<eos> Sleep!<eos> Train, say your prayers, eat your vitamins.<eos> Chewables and the swallow kind.
Sleep!<eos> Train, say your prayers, eat your vitamins.<eos> Chewables and the swallow kind.<eos> I'm coming for you, Hep Cat.<eos> Body slam!
You want me to do the rope-a-dope?<eos> I know it's a lot to ask of ya, but I'm right on the back foot here, ain't I?<eos> I do this... and our problem goes away?<eos> Like it never happened.<eos> - All right, then.
I think you mean your boyfriend hustled us.<eos> Soon to be ex-boyfriend.<eos> Time to move along.<eos> Your eye all right, tough guy?<eos> Still in its socket.
Do you understand?<eos> I thought you were taking it easy.<eos> Uh, it felt okay for a second, I forgot.<eos> How much can I get for this?<eos> On your finger?
No, I mean here here.<eos> On Wozniak's aptly named "Garbage Unit."<eos> - I was assigned here.<eos> - Hmm.<eos> After patrol.
The Mets are playing like the Mets.<eos> Linda left you?<eos> Oh, you don't care about my back?<eos> Yeah, she found out.<eos> About what?
Linda left you?<eos> Oh, you don't care about my back?<eos> Yeah, she found out.<eos> About what?<eos> Donnie.
an engagement announcement in the "New Haven Register"<eos> from last spring, during our victim's happier times.<eos> The victim was engaged to James Nava.<eos> Is that our ADA?<eos> Cha!
Thank you, Woz.<eos> If anyone's gonna make you pay for your screw-ups, it damn well better be me.<eos> Looks like Bianchi got away with murder today.<eos> In a way, so did I.<eos> For now.
- You think he would go there?<eos> - Hey, it's worth a shot.<eos> We good, Loman?<eos> Hey, how'd you beat us here?<eos> 12:00.
- What'd I miss?<eos> Woz lost to a nine-year-old.<eos> Who had a bag full of Fentanyl.<eos> - Now we know who's pushing it.<eos> - Quince?
And you can't put in a written request with the case number because...<eos> I'd rather owe you drinks.<eos> Maybe if you clean those fingernails.<eos> Yeah. I was working in the garden.<eos> In October?
Patrolmen can't keep their mouths shut.<eos> I leaked it.<eos> - What?<eos> - Our shooting suspect is here.<eos> Not Greenpoint Community.
How about you start with takeout?<eos> Nothing says "I love you" like burgers and ketchup packets.<eos> Because I do.<eos> I literally kicked my foot back.<eos> Like a cartoon.
What do you got?<eos> - 14th Street subway exit.<eos> - Near Hudson University.<eos> - I don't need to know.<eos> - Two to a car.
Hey, man.<eos> I said let's show them how it's done.<eos> Whoo!<eos> That's what I'm talkin' about.<eos> All right.
Okay?<eos> You know, Wyatt... in our world, it's... it's good to be one of the smart ones.<eos> Remember that.<eos> Okay?<eos> ...this season for the tri-county region.
Neither he nor his fiancée have been heard from in almost a week.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> When's the last time you two spoke?<eos> Tuesday? Last Tuesday, I think.<eos> - What time?
I've had a shit day.<eos> What was shitty about it?<eos> Ice cream, Marty.<eos> I accosted a kid at a store over fucking pistachio ice cream.<eos> - Okay.
Help?<eos> Like, selling houses?<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> Of course not.<eos> But maybe in the office.
Bullshit.<eos> You're how old?<eos> Nineteen.<eos> - What year were you born?<eos> - 1998.
- Got that two grand?<eos> - Yeah, what's it for?<eos> You don't want to know, Martin.<eos> Extraneous shit.<eos> All right.
How do you know that's Bobby Dean?<eos> Because I've sat with him. Pretty sure that's Bobby Dean.<eos> Well, what distinguishing feature are you seeing here?<eos> - Please don't argue with me. - What?<eos> What, his eyes?
You, being here, being visible to customers... I'm not sure that's good for business right now.<eos> You should stay away.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> At least, you know, camp out in the office or something till this gets sorted out.<eos> Yeah, fine.
Here's that bill of sale you asked for.<eos> You can see the final sale price there and the date of transfer.<eos> Next page, you can see the certification, the... title transaction.<eos> It's all there.<eos> - Okay? I...
You know, before we make a decision on a church, we wanted to make sure that we researched all of them.<eos> And all the gentlemen's clubs.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay, look, obviously we're not the most religious people<eos> - on the planet.
I have some wonderful news.<eos> Soon, our faith community... is gonna have a home. - Yeah!<eos> - Praise Jesus!<eos> - Yeah. A real home!<eos> On the land!
And, you know, if you don't agree, I thank you for everything, and you know, I'll just go...<eos> I'll go right on over to, uh, to Lakeview Realty. - I'll see what they can offer me.<eos> - No.<eos> Mom, just... Okay.<eos> Okay.
We just redid the employee lounge.<eos> I'm gonna need a ride afterwards. They need...<eos> They need another van to help expedite the work, so I'm just gonna leave them mine.<eos> A ride? Yeah.<eos> Sometime in the afternoon.
Oh, fuckin' thing...<eos> Gonna tell me why you came here?<eos> Nope.<eos> I was in politics once.<eos> In Chicago.
What we were all trying to do together.<eos> I quit after Charlotte was born.<eos> Childcare was more than my paycheck, so...<eos> And now, here I am.<eos> In Nowhere, Missouri.
Um, I have a thing to do tonight, so I can't. Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah. Well, next time. Yeah.<eos> Definitely.<eos> Bye.
Meet me at the strip dock.<eos> - Are you sure?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> Bye.
- No, I'm sorry. Not till Tuesday.<eos> My bad, then. I'll just come back then.<eos> Okay.<eos> Actually... would you happen to have any other property similar to this?<eos> Same price range?
Jonah, he's dragging dead animals around with their guts falling out.<eos> He wants to shoot birds out of the sky!<eos> There was a corpse that came up to our dock, and in our basement, right now, there is an old man dying as we speak.<eos> Let me ask you a question. How long before you follow them?<eos> To Chicago.
Listen, I had a thought.<eos> You know, Chicago fucking winters are brutal.<eos> I can't take it.<eos> It might be beneficial for both of us if I set up a shop somewhere warm, like where you're at.<eos> - Maybe down in the Caymans.
But to come to Bruce's mild defense, he was always the first person at the hospital when the kids were born. You know, or at least the second.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Or the...<eos> - the fourth or the fifth...<eos> - Top five.
I need someone who's not just brilliant, but who also has integrity.<eos> Because integrity, my friend... is the shield to greed and vanity.<eos> Well, you want somebody with integrity to do a job where they have to discard their ethics.<eos> Are you talking about societal ethics or your own?<eos> Well, probably both.
Does he still snore like a baby dinosaur?<eos> Ma, you can sleep outside in our tent, if you want.<eos> I put some earplugs on your nightstand.<eos> Oh, hey, where should I put your prescription?<eos> In the trash.
So... what if I had an alternate solution?<eos> There's no hit man out front.<eos> I transferred the last of the eight.<eos> - We're done?<eos> - For now.
That's my estimate for the street value of what was on the boat today.<eos> Go on.<eos> I take it you don't want to go back to your old way of distribution?<eos> Right?<eos> On land?
That true?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Said it was some kind of accident.<eos> They got electrocuted on a dock.<eos> At the Blue Cat Lodge.
It would give you a lot of political capital.<eos> You'd be able to do, in five years, what no Snell has been able to do in the last 75.<eos> Mr. Del Rio?<eos> I need to make a phone call.<eos> Someplace private.
For everything.<eos> Well, it's just what you do.<eos> Bye, Buddy.<eos> We have a deal.<eos> Okay.
You need more fun in your life. Oh, yeah?<eos> Or not.<eos> But I'd say so.<eos> Were you always so serious?<eos> Even at my age?
Middle of the night.<eos> Appendix burst.<eos> I'll get you home as fast as possible.<eos> Where was it in the room?<eos> On the table right there.
Why the fuck is it empty, Ma?<eos> Chelsea's supposed to bring you fresh ones.<eos> It's not supposed to be empty.<eos> Where am I supposed to get one in the middle of the night?<eos> Hospital.
Kevin, Kevin, stay with me, okay?<eos> I need you to call 911 and report this.<eos> Where's your phone?<eos> I can't. I can't.<eos> Okay, all right.
Then I exorcise the trickster for you.<eos> After you pay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> $1 million?<eos> In gold.
They've been put in the restricted section with the other anti-Semitic texts.<eos> Hey.<eos> I'm...<eos> Long story.<eos> Anyway...
With these, we're golden.<eos> Margo and Eliot grabbed everything else we need for the morning.<eos> So go rest up, Goldwater.<eos> You've earned it.<eos> All right.
Yes. I'm just... I'm doing long division in my head.<eos> Move. Move.<eos> I've always been good at math.<eos> You okay? - Oh, shit. Yeah, I'm okay.<eos> - Okay.
There was a man in the mist.<eos> He came out of nowhere.<eos> He shot Benedict, and then he shot himself.<eos> You can't see a thing outside, man.<eos> Right up against the front door.
It wasn't working.<eos> We'll find another way.<eos> Give us a minute.<eos> You ever seen those guys before?<eos> In the mall? Around town?
It was no coincidence he found me on my way here.<eos> He used me to get in.<eos> This whole ship is tech.<eos> Where would you go to do the most damage?<eos> The server room.
I was voted most likely to succeed.<eos> And succeed you have, my friend.<eos> What do you want, Fink?<eos> I wanna talk...<eos> - about a truck...
No.<eos> You're a junior partner. That's it.<eos> Good luck with Saul Gold, boys.<eos> All right.<eos> All right.
Hate 'Em.<eos> Hate 'Em!<eos> - What?<eos> - Phone's on the piss. You top it up?<eos> Yeah, last week.
Your will, I say.<eos> Come on.<eos> - Another bottle.<eos> - Just play the tiles, and then I'll get you anything you want.<eos> - You all right?
How much gold is this Nas Stone fella looking to buy?<eos> He said we'd start off with 250K sterling.<eos> That should take care of your immediate problem.<eos> And then, we'll take it from there if both parties agree.<eos> All right.
What's with all the questions?<eos> You worried gonna have to start cooking for yourself again?<eos> Sorry, that was a little strong.<eos> While I was convalescing, I was remembering the times you'd cook me and Vic a fry-up after a job.<eos> Always at some ungodly hour.
I found something.<eos> For Christ sakes!<eos> Lily Hill, I'm arresting you on suspicion of possessing Prohibited Weapons defined by Section Five of the Firearms Act, 1968,<eos> You do not have to say anything, but it may it harm your defense if you do not mention my questioned something which you later rely on in court. Anything you do say may be given in evidence.<eos> All right?
I drove him back from the country estate yesterday!<eos> He was more than a little under the influence.<eos> Blathering on about a... A golden bathtub!<eos> Complete gibberish!<eos> Golden bathtub?
Blathering on about a... A golden bathtub!<eos> Complete gibberish!<eos> Golden bathtub?<eos> No, no! And... and something about gypsies and smelting...<eos> - Gypsies?
I think it's a really bad idea.<eos> But if you want.<eos> You remember that bay we used to go to?<eos> When we were in high school?<eos> After a big night.
We've got no source.<eos> We've got no distro.<eos> We've got someone on our ass and we don't even know who it is.<eos> I'd like to talk to Camila.<eos> Alone, please.
And someone working among us.<eos> This is now your top.<eos> Priority. I need to know if they're targeting marigold.<eos> We have a mole.<eos> Sir?
There were bullet holes.<eos> This is what you were talking about the other day, wasn't it?<eos> I joined the women's league to help.<eos> I thought I was helping, but it's everywhere, isn't it?<eos> Even in the needlework.
Hack, slash, hack, slash.<eos> I mean, really, what's the point?<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> The point is to use your wraith abilities to exact revenge on the forces of Sauron.<eos> In the larger sense.
Not to mention the smell of it.<eos> - Ravi can eat a bag of...<eos> I didn't realize you had company.<eos> Company with cocktails.<eos> Old Fashioned?
- You know...<eos> - Die. Yeah, that.<eos> I offered up our couch for a few nights.<eos> I hope that's okay.<eos> - Okay.
What I do know is, if this is my last night to spend with this Blaine...<eos> I don't wanna waste it.<eos> Me, neither.<eos> Okay, okay, okay, okay... Okay, okay, okay, okay...<eos> All right, all right, all right.
Hey, be my guest.<eos> It's a bit more weapon than you're used to, the sight's a little off, but you seem like a big boy...<eos> Not bad.<eos> We had a few questions about something you posted online.<eos> "Online." Online where?
Rev, look, it is not your fault that she's gone.<eos> Murdered.<eos> Butchered.<eos> Not "gone."<eos> Okay, fine.
There isn't any kind of conspiracy.<eos> What it is... is a tragedy, and I'm not gonna let it turn into some goddamn circus.<eos> So, I want everyone to take a deep breath.<eos> And I want you to go on home and say a prayer... for our sister who has gone on home much too early.<eos> All right.
Did you escape?<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> All right, Owen.<eos> You better not be fuckin' with us.<eos> Upstairs.
An administrator.<eos> - Someone higher up. - I'm the Chief of Staff here.<eos> But now you're disturbing the entire floor.<eos> Get me Security on the line. Amber?<eos> Amber?
So, this is our little fox trap, huh?<eos> Yeah.<eos> So, you want to tell me where you hooked up with your partner?<eos> The Dirty Dozen?<eos> Fillory.
I really hope you weren't planning to drink from it.<eos> - It's hardly potable.<eos> - You... what?<eos> Left my leavings... a godly floater... behind.<eos> In the Wellspring.
Yeah, but when you said, don't touch my stuff,<eos> I thought you mean like, your soy milk and your computer.<eos> No, I meant don't touch my stuff.<eos> Dude, that is genius. Yeah.<eos> Morning. Morning. Ooh.
Morning. Morning. Ooh.<eos> And good morning to you, and good morning to you.<eos> I see you've noticed my recent pregnancy lift from the boob fairy.<eos> That's such a better job than being the tooth fairy.<eos> Davis.
And good morning to you, and good morning to you.<eos> I see you've noticed my recent pregnancy lift from the boob fairy.<eos> That's such a better job than being the tooth fairy.<eos> Davis.<eos> Dude, huh?
What they never mention is that in the second trimester, it all gets replaced by sexy, hot feelings, and one's booty's becoming so delicious.<eos> Oh, yes, you do have a massive amount of junk in your trunk.<eos> My booty is delicious. My booty is delicious.<eos> Delicious.<eos> Brian.
No, that's you.<eos> Or maybe me. No<eos> So... Billie, I'd-I'd love to catch up with y some time.<eos> What are you doing later?<eos> Brian!
Or maybe me. No<eos> So... Billie, I'd-I'd love to catch up with y some time.<eos> What are you doing later?<eos> Brian!<eos> James.
What are you doing later?<eos> Brian!<eos> James.<eos> Hey, if you're done talking to my girl there, You want to grab a bite?<eos> Uh, sure.
Oh, my God, are you ever gonna let that go?<eos> No.<eos> I don't know if it has something to do with your inner ear, or the tides.<eos> You even cause chain spilling. But my event!<eos> No! Fine.
You could try that... on your palm.<eos> Boom! Problem solved.<eos> Now your junk will be normal color and smell like vacation.<eos> I took your advice and tried to seduce Zack, and he turned me down.<eos> What? !
Boom! Problem solved.<eos> Now your junk will be normal color and smell like vacation.<eos> I took your advice and tried to seduce Zack, and he turned me down.<eos> What? !<eos> Oh, impossible.
And even then... even then with all my mistakes piled around me like the empty pizza boxes from last night's depression feast, even then I will not give you that dress. But you'll think about it, right?<eos> Hi, milkshake.<eos> Yeah, yeah, my milkshake is in the freezer for five years.<eos> You okay?<eos> Brian!
I got a date.<eos> We good?<eos> I'll stop touching you.<eos> Join the club.<eos> What?
I'll stop touching you.<eos> Join the club.<eos> What?<eos> Have a fun date!<eos> Hey, buddy.
pee on a stick, blue plus sign, ta-da!<eos> It's been a very full year.<eos> Well, who's the dad?<eos> Ah, you know, he's a great guy.<eos> A great, much younger guy.
I have to admit I've imagined us on a date for a while.<eos> Would you like some desert?<eos> Always.<eos> You know who makes an amazing chocolate torte?<eos> Room service.
Always.<eos> You know who makes an amazing chocolate torte?<eos> Room service.<eos> I just need to powder a number of items.<eos> Abby?
to know what to do on your own.<eos> You know in your heart what's right and even if you screw up occasionally, you are a good person.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You're a good sister. I know.<eos> Haute couture.
You're a good sister. I know.<eos> Haute couture.<eos> There is no substitute.<eos> Hey, Billie, I'm home!<eos> Abby?
Go, Zack.<eos> And forget you ever saw me.<eos> Okay, and the dress or the jewelry, ooh, ooh, and this bag, this bag.<eos> Go!<eos> Billie.
And forget you ever saw me.<eos> Okay, and the dress or the jewelry, ooh, ooh, and this bag, this bag.<eos> Go!<eos> Billie.<eos> Zack.
Who told you I was her Abby.<eos> Look,<eos> I don't care if you slept with him.<eos> That's actually not true, I do care.<eos> Zack...
That's actually not true, I do care.<eos> Zack...<eos> Let me-let me finish, okay?<eos> I really need you to know that I really wanted to sleep with you.<eos> Zack...

- And now Hanka Robotics serves it...<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> Look.<eos> This is what I'm talking about.<eos> Major!
You're not the same.<eos> Hey, it's just a robot!<eos> Your skin deserves the best, so do you.<eos> Try our hand cream.<eos> [DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, CENTRAL OFFICE, SECTION 9]
Something's different.<eos> What'd you get?<eos> Why are you always thinking he's out there enhancing.<eos> Because he is.<eos> Cyber mech liver.
And the third was beaten to death by his own service robot.<eos> All showed signs of cerebral hacking.<eos> The same as the geisha did to Osmond.<eos> And all were senior figures in Hanka.<eos> Just like Osmond.
Togusa.<eos> You and Ladriya go speak to Mr. Cutter, the CEO of Hanka.<eos> Major and Batou take a look at Dahlin report.<eos> Find out what has been recovered from the geisha.<eos> Major!
- Hey, sweetheart, want an upgrade?<eos> - Move.<eos> - I have anything you want.<eos> - Back off!<eos> - Hey, Ming!
- Move.<eos> - I have anything you want.<eos> - Back off!<eos> - Hey, Ming!<eos> - Hey, Batou!
Don't know.<eos> I like just strays and they like me.<eos> They like you 'cause you feed them.<eos> You got no heart.<eos> Hey, girls!
I like just strays and they like me.<eos> They like you 'cause you feed them.<eos> You got no heart.<eos> Hey, girls!<eos> Hey Gabriel!
You got no heart.<eos> Hey, girls!<eos> Hey Gabriel!<eos> Meet Major.<eos> Major, Gabriel.
You don't talk about that stuff.<eos> What?<eos> - Your past.<eos> - I don't remember much.<eos> Just fragments, bits and pieces.
It feels like there's always this thick fog over my memory and I can't seen through it.<eos> You're lucky.<eos> Every single day, I get screwed by my memories.<eos> It's better to be pure.<eos> Like you.
- Have you been taking your medication?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> These ones are still cycling.<eos> I had two this morning.<eos> - Sound or image?
- Yeah.<eos> These ones are still cycling.<eos> I had two this morning.<eos> - Sound or image?<eos> - Both.
You are entering a Hanka secure area.<eos> Authorized personnel only.<eos> Please disable communication enhancement.<eos> I'm busy.<eos> Dr. Dahlin!
We don't have the time.<eos> She was a Hanka companion bot.<eos> But she was reprogrammed for cerebral hacking.<eos> What was on her drives?<eos> Nothing.
Then I have to do a deep dive.<eos> You can't encrypt during a deep dive<eos> I know.<eos> They could've left traps in her.<eos> Mag pulses, viruses.
You'll be wide open.<eos> I have to get inside her memory.<eos> It's the fastest way to find Kuze.<eos> It's too dangerous.<eos> And highly irresponsible.
- Can I help you?<eos> - I'm looking for someone.<eos> You been here before?<eos> My friend had some mech work done here.<eos> Industry stuff.
You been here before?<eos> My friend had some mech work done here.<eos> Industry stuff.<eos> We don't do mech work here.<eos> My mistake.
I'll be here when you need me.<eos> - You say your friend worked here?<eos> - I said my friend had work done here.<eos> She's human?<eos> Your friend.
- I said my friend had work done here.<eos> She's human?<eos> Your friend.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> Batou.
Listen.<eos> No signals going in or out.<eos> Major, I'm in position.<eos> Do you copy?<eos> Beer.
Back on comms. I'm heading to the back room.<eos> I missed you.<eos> I'll meet you there.<eos> Collaborate with Hanka Robotics and be destroyed.<eos> Major?
You're what everyone will become one day.<eos> You don't know how alone that makes me feel.<eos> I can see you out there, you know.<eos> How many fingers am I holding up?<eos> Funny.
I guess I see like you now.<eos> Don't worry, you'll get used to it.<eos> Thanks for saving my ass.<eos> Glad to see you're okay.<eos> Major?
You realize the supreme importance that Hanka represents to this government.<eos> Major is the future of my company.<eos> If you compromise your systems again...<eos> I will burn this section.<eos> Yes sir.
What does that feel like?<eos> It feels... different.<eos> What are you?<eos> [SECURE PROJECT 2571]<eos> [HANKA PERSONNEL FILES]
What've you got?<eos> Another Hanka scientist has been found dead.<eos> It's Dahlin.<eos> Got it.<eos> Major this way.
She found what Kuze stole from Osmond.<eos> It's a list of everyone who worked on a project called 2571.<eos> That's who he's targeting.<eos> Is there anyone else on that list?<eos> [DR. OUELET]
Don't get me wrong.<eos> I love that kid to pieces.<eos> I do. She's amazing.<eos> But when she practices that thing, it is painful, right?<eos> Why not piano?
It's a tall place, right?<eos> You don't have a child.<eos> You don't have a wife.<eos> You live alone, just you.<eos> - What?
The hack must have created a vacuum.<eos> Kuze's wiped his memory... and somehow installed a new reality.<eos> At least he got to believe he had a kid.<eos> What's the difference huh?<eos> Fantasy, reality...
At least he got to believe he had a kid.<eos> What's the difference huh?<eos> Fantasy, reality...<eos> Dreams, memories... it's all the same.<eos> Just noise.
We should uplink to the machine, trace the code, get a lock on his location.<eos> Do it.<eos> Don't go in there.<eos> It's too dangerous.<eos> Major
No Please.<eos> I know..what...<eos> We got'im.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Weapons armed.
- On me.<eos> Stay Down!<eos> Stay Down!<eos> Put it down, put it down.<eos> Grenade!
Stay Down!<eos> Stay Down!<eos> Put it down, put it down.<eos> Grenade!<eos> Major!
We're coming to your position.<eos> Tell me who you are.<eos> I'm that which you seek to destroy.<eos> In this life, my name is...<eos> Kuze.
What a beauty you are!<eos> They have improved s-so much, since they made me.<eos> They thought that we would be a part of their evolution.<eos> But they have created us, to evolve alone... beyond them.<eos> Evolution?
Defense of self!<eos> More will die... until they tell me what they took.<eos> I won't let that happen.<eos> You want to kill me?<eos> Like everyone else?
Remember that.<eos> And maybe you can remember it all.<eos> Get away from her!<eos> Get down on the ground now.<eos> Major!
And maybe you can remember it all.<eos> Get away from her!<eos> Get down on the ground now.<eos> Major!<eos> Major!
Get down on the ground now.<eos> Major!<eos> Major!<eos> ...Dozens.<eos> How many?

You wouldn't exist if it weren't for those experiments.<eos> Experiments?<eos> - Is that what I am to you?<eos> - No!<eos> No, Mira!

Where did I come from?<eos> Mr. Cutter brought them to us.<eos> I didn't ask questions.<eos> The harbor?<eos> My parents?
I just don't like it.<eos> I need you to take me back.<eos> There's more I need to find out.<eos> Sure.<eos> Dr. Ouelet...
I will delete all the data and reprogram her.<eos> - She won't remember him at all.<eos> - No, no, no...<eos> You download all the data on the terrorist and then I order you to terminate.<eos> - What?

This goes public, your unit goes down.<eos> You kill her, you kill us.<eos> I'll take that under advisement.<eos> So what now?<eos> Oh, the poor pumpkin!
I see her in so many young women.<eos> On the street, in my dreams.<eos> As if she's still here.<eos> She was... fearless.<eos> And wild.
Air support 5 minutes out.<eos> Is the spider tank within range?<eos> Yes sir.<eos> Awaiting your orders sir.<eos> Motoko!
All of us run-aways.<eos> We had nothing... except each other.<eos> They took that from us.<eos> Your name was Hideo.<eos> Motoko.
They took that from us.<eos> Your name was Hideo.<eos> Motoko.<eos> That was your name.<eos> Motoko.
Hey.<eos> Say something nice.<eos> What's your name?<eos> Aramaki told me you had a name from before.<eos> Motoko.
You're accused of murder and crimes against the state.<eos> I thought that it might be you.<eos> It's unwise to resist.<eos> Please.<eos> Major?
But what we do defines us.<eos> My ghost survived to remind the next* of us that humanity is our virtue.<eos> I know who I am.<eos> And what I'm here to do.<eos> Major.
My ghost survived to remind the next* of us that humanity is our virtue.<eos> I know who I am.<eos> And what I'm here to do.<eos> Major.<eos> Engage targets.
Big drought hits Southern California.<eos> Got so bad, rich suburbanites couldn't afford to fill their swimming pools.<eos> That's when the light clicked on.<eos> Some kid figured out he could skate those empty pools and get some real nasty air.<eos> Dogtown and Z-Boys.
Well, that's my pitch.<eos> I always was a better spy than a salesman.<eos> So, what do you say?<eos> I'm not a soldier, I'm a baller.<eos> My bad.
One of you is behind this.<eos> And I am not leaving here until I find out who.<eos> You fight me with a book?<eos> Here you go, brother.<eos> Chapter one!
And I am not leaving here until I find out who.<eos> You fight me with a book?<eos> Here you go, brother.<eos> Chapter one!<eos> Page one!
No.<eos> But Gibbons did.<eos> What you doing?<eos> That's loco, chico!<eos> Xander!
You have three seconds to comply!<eos> You're not good at this.<eos> One!<eos> Two!<eos> Okay!
One!<eos> Two!<eos> Okay!<eos> Come on out, Frankenstein!<eos> Gibbons!
Two!<eos> Okay!<eos> Come on out, Frankenstein!<eos> Gibbons!<eos> Gibbons?
Then the body armor would've been real.<eos> I don't know you, but-- I don't like to be tested.<eos> Gibbons never believed you were dead!<eos> Never stopped looking for you.<eos> Hell of a friend.
Uh, where are you going?<eos> - London. - Why?<eos> What's in London?<eos> A ghost hunter.<eos> And possibly my fur coat.
No wonder our country's in debt trillions of dollars.<eos> Do you really need all these gadgets to get the bad guys?<eos> Oh, we don't need any of it.<eos> But it makes the catching a hell of a lot more fun.<eos> Xander Cage.
- I'm kidding.<eos> It's not like I have a safe word, or anything.<eos> It's "kumquat."<eos> Never really think about it.<eos> Kumquat.
But if you need a fifty of Purple Urkle, I am not the girl to ask.<eos> Okay, Cage, follow me.<eos> I'll introduce you to your ground team.<eos> - Thank you, Becky.<eos> - Of course.
Okay, Cage, follow me.<eos> I'll introduce you to your ground team.<eos> - Thank you, Becky.<eos> - Of course.<eos> Kumquat.
- Of course.<eos> Kumquat.<eos> Hey, here comes the Red Bull freak show.<eos> Xander Cage, I want you to meet Paul--<eos> Donovan.
Kumquat.<eos> Hey, here comes the Red Bull freak show.<eos> Xander Cage, I want you to meet Paul--<eos> Donovan.<eos> Captain Paul Donovan.
That must have been pretty cool, right?<eos> You guys must have some seriously cool stories to tell.<eos> Must've seen a lot.<eos> I wonder, how many of you have ever pulled a freestyle triple back-flip on a BMX bike before?<eos> All of you?
I'm not gonna have clowns watch my back.<eos> I know I'm gonna regret asking you this, but who would you trust?<eos> You know, no one has this number.<eos> So, what are you up to these days?<eos> Me?
It was like that when I got here.<eos> Nobody gets in unless you're an X-Game participant! You hear me?<eos> That guy got through.<eos> Hey, get back here!<eos> Wassup, Nyjah?
That guy got through.<eos> Hey, get back here!<eos> Wassup, Nyjah?<eos> Lightning-bolt and Burrito.<eos> Chad, wassup, bro?
Roberta.<eos> I'll see you later.<eos> Show him the love!<eos> Give it up for The Hood!<eos> The good, the bad, the extreme, and the completely insane.
I wasn't kidding when I said there's enough force in these bad boys to probably punch a hole through the fricking plane.<eos> Keep screwing around.<eos> What could possibly go wrong?<eos> - That is my style, though.<eos> - Yeah, good.
You need something, man?<eos> Well, I heard this is a perfect place to disappear for a few days for my crew, no questions asked.<eos> Hey, Mi casa es su casa, if the price is right.<eos> Perfect.<eos> Tennyson!
Tennyson!<eos> You're gonna like this.<eos> I just happen to have the best hardware in the South Pacific.<eos> 30% off the top gets you our finest hospitality package.<eos> 30% off the top?

You turn around, go get your boat. You can kiss my ass.<eos> Okay, hang on.<eos> What do you think?<eos> You talked me into it!<eos> 18%!
18%!<eos> You think this is a flea market?<eos> You think we're in the hood selling TVs and fake watches, or something like that?<eos> - What's wrong with you, man? - "That guy is crazy."<eos> All right. Twenty-two and a half.
- What's wrong with you, man? - "That guy is crazy."<eos> All right. Twenty-two and a half.<eos> How you gonna do "and a half" ?<eos> Twenty-two and a half.<eos> All right.
All right.<eos> Enjoy this party.<eos> I like your style, man.<eos> Stay on that boat, no matter what.<eos> Adele, Nicks!
Either way, somebody's getting burnt up tonight!<eos> I told you he was fun to have around.<eos> At first, I thought Special Forces.<eos> But your ink's all wrong.<eos> CIA?
At first, I thought Special Forces.<eos> But your ink's all wrong.<eos> CIA?<eos> They would send in a drone, bomb us to hell.<eos> MI6?
Bit of a stalemate.<eos> Not if you drop the gun.<eos> I'm not the bad guy.<eos> I don't believe in good guys.<eos> Serena?
So, you're willing to kill just to keep that for yourself?<eos> That's the wrong question to ask.<eos> What's the right question?<eos> "Are you willing to die for it" ?<eos> One grenade, three people.
Can I have my jacket, when you get a sec?<eos> Then a man comes along, tells me a story about a drought in California.<eos> About skateboards and swimming pools.<eos> About a man named Xander Cage.<eos> Oh, shit.
You ready to have some fun?<eos> What are you waiting? Stop the music! Quickly--<eos> Stop it!<eos> Everybody, hands up!<eos> Now!
I moved.<eos> I just moved again.<eos> I'm still alive.<eos> Shut up, "hero" !<eos> All right.
'Cause like I said, if you take this from me, you die first.<eos> I'll take it from you dead or alive.<eos> And if you hold it too tight, I cut your arm off.<eos> Suit yourself.<eos> Leningrad.
I'll take it from you dead or alive.<eos> And if you hold it too tight, I cut your arm off.<eos> Suit yourself.<eos> Leningrad.<eos> Hi, Ivan.
Suit yourself.<eos> Leningrad.<eos> Hi, Ivan.<eos> Other Ivan.<eos> Ooh, bye-bye, Moscow Mule.
Other Ivan.<eos> Ooh, bye-bye, Moscow Mule.<eos> That's another one you owe me, X.<eos> Read between the lines.<eos> Tennyson!
Oh, no problem.<eos> How was your trip?<eos> I'm just doing the math.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> What math?
Yeah, whatever, bro.<eos> ...do you think that counts as crash 199 for me?<eos> You know, officially?<eos> Officially, you're deranged.<eos> Cool.
Officially, you're deranged.<eos> Cool.<eos> We'll set up a triangulated signal tracking system around the city.<eos> And when Becky locks in his exact location, we make our move.<eos> What about you?
Gibbons to the rescue.<eos> He said a lion like me doesn't belong in any kind of cage.<eos> I got mine after I left the NSA.<eos> What about that one on your wrist?<eos> London.
What about that one on your wrist?<eos> London.<eos> 2009.<eos> I climbed the Millennium Wheel.<eos> Naked.
London.<eos> 2009.<eos> I climbed the Millennium Wheel.<eos> Naked.<eos> - Naked?

High school.<eos> Oh, no!<eos> We all have our embarrassing moments.<eos> What about that sexy one?<eos> This?
He's on the top floor.<eos> I'm showing activity in Pandora's Box.<eos> You've got to get there fast and take this guy down.<eos> Not if we find him first.<eos> Whoa! Red light!
I'm showing activity in Pandora's Box.<eos> You've got to get there fast and take this guy down.<eos> Not if we find him first.<eos> Whoa! Red light!<eos> Red light!
- Welcome to the moment. - Whoa, whoa, whoa--<eos> Everyone needs backup.<eos> Stop, stop, stop, stop!<eos> Stop, stop, stop, stop!<eos> Tennyson?
You have to hurry.<eos> I have a plan.<eos> Hold on!<eos> "Hold on" ain't no goddamn plan!<eos> Hi.
No, no, no... Xander, you got to get to the top floor.<eos> He's trying to engage another satellite.<eos> Hurry.<eos> Fish in a barrel.<eos> Forty-five U.S.P.
He's turned the heat up.<eos> I can't see shit.<eos> X, can't see you guys.<eos> Thermal's no good.<eos> - Right?
Easy.<eos> X, keep Chatty Cathy talking. I still don't have a shot.<eos> We made it that way.<eos> People like Gibbons and the two of you.<eos> And me.
What the hell are you talking about?<eos> I'm serious.<eos> What the hell's wrong with you?<eos> Right there.<eos> Nice shot.
Nice shot.<eos> Was there ever a doubt?<eos> Uh, yeah, I confess, I had my doubts.<eos> That's for talking shit about my friend, Gibbons.<eos> Xiang!
That's for talking shit about my friend, Gibbons.<eos> Xiang!<eos> Get on your knees!<eos> On your knees!<eos> Hands!
But they're taking Xiang.<eos> Oh, and, Serena, if you don't hear from me, remember, dial nine.<eos> X takes care of its own.<eos> You gave it back to Marke, didn't you?<eos> Nice place.
Oh, and, Serena, if you don't hear from me, remember, dial nine.<eos> X takes care of its own.<eos> You gave it back to Marke, didn't you?<eos> Nice place.<eos> Spacious.
X takes care of its own.<eos> You gave it back to Marke, didn't you?<eos> Nice place.<eos> Spacious.<eos> Expensive.
You're just another tyrant.<eos> No.<eos> Patriot.<eos> Let me educate you on the difference.<eos> Xander!
No.<eos> Patriot.<eos> Let me educate you on the difference.<eos> Xander!<eos> Xander!
They say it's the last great adventure, Cage.<eos> Be sure and send a postcard.<eos> - Engines hot!<eos> - Let's go!<eos> Xander!
Be sure and send a postcard.<eos> - Engines hot!<eos> - Let's go!<eos> Xander!<eos> Xander Cage!
Find cover!<eos> Move!<eos> Get behind there!<eos> There, take cover! Okay, okay.<eos> What a rush.
Damn, Becky, that's some body armor.<eos> Hey. I told you you got no manners.<eos> Did your mother ever teach you how to zip up your pants?<eos> Well?<eos> Serena.
Not if I jam the signal!<eos> I need a power source!<eos> Go!<eos> Over there?<eos> By myself?
Are you getting this interference?<eos> Everyone needs backup, right?<eos> Yeah, I guess.<eos> Let's do this.<eos> Nicks!
Listen!<eos> From now on, I make the plans, you execute!<eos> Oh, my God, this is fucking awesome!<eos> What's wrong, hotshot?<eos> No witty comeback?
Nothing.<eos> I'm empty.<eos> - We go on three. - Okay.<eos> Wassup?<eos> Rock, paper, scissor, grenade launcher.
I love that song.<eos> And it could be a wonderful world, if we just stopped doing bad shit to it.<eos> If you wanted me out of retirement, you could've just asked me.<eos> You always responded to less subtle motivation.<eos> Now what?
Andy, is that you?<eos> Oh, hi, Zeke.
Andy, is that you?<eos> Oh, hi, Zeke.<eos> Did you hear anything?<eos> Not yet, no.<eos> - Morning, Sally. - Morning.
Thank you, Uncle Zeke.<eos> Sally, were you speaking to someone down in the basement? No.<eos> Sally has an imaginary friend named Melissa.<eos> Hello?<eos> Oh, hi, Reed.
Hello?<eos> Oh, hi, Reed.<eos> Any word about Andy?<eos> Hang on.<eos> Mornin'.
I'll see you in a few.<eos> Sally! Go upstairs.<eos> - But I want.<eos> - Go upstairs now.<eos> Ezekiel!
- You don't say?<eos> - It's an '87 Cavalier.<eos> You should be more surprised.<eos> - Surprise is for the ill-prepared.<eos> - What?
Hey, I fucking got it.<eos> When can you get away?<eos> Okay, Shimmer Lake?<eos> I'll wait for you. Okay.<eos> Fuck, Zeke.
When can you get away?<eos> Okay, Shimmer Lake?<eos> I'll wait for you. Okay.<eos> Fuck, Zeke.<eos> Mornin', Harris.
Mornin', Harris.<eos> Guess you're ridin' up front, huh?<eos> Is that right, Zeke?<eos> Why?<eos> - Morning, Reed.
Seriously, though, I did see a naked kid.<eos> - Jesus.<eos> Enough already, will ya? - I just. I saw it.<eos> You represent the Bureau.<eos> Judge Dawkins?
Do they teach you that at Quantico?<eos> - Rippin' on you.<eos> - Yeah, you think so?<eos> Judge Dawkins!<eos> Zeke Sikes!
Judge Dawkins!<eos> Zeke Sikes!<eos> Can you open up, please?<eos> Judge?<eos> Sikes.
Zeke Sikes!<eos> Can you open up, please?<eos> Judge?<eos> Sikes.<eos> Martha?
I don't even see how it matters.<eos> Well, you'll see that it matters when we find my brother Andy's dead body, you stupid assholes.<eos> Oh!<eos> Your partner's being real pig-headed about this.<eos> My partner?
Any information I get, you'll be the first to know.<eos> Thanks, partner.<eos> How about this?<eos> There's a woman who looks exactly like Steph Burton, except she's three feet tall.<eos> Yes or no?
What do you say we stop.?<eos> No, please don't!<eos> This is Ed.<eos> Leave a message. See what happens.<eos> Shit.
No, please don't!<eos> This is Ed.<eos> Leave a message. See what happens.<eos> Shit.<eos> Stephanie? Steph?
- Where have I been?<eos> In a car, forever! The cornfield!<eos> I spent the night in a junkyard!<eos> Listen, Dawkins has the money.<eos> Dawkins?
In a car, forever! The cornfield!<eos> I spent the night in a junkyard!<eos> Listen, Dawkins has the money.<eos> Dawkins?<eos> Shit.
What? You think Dawkins is just gonna give you the money?<eos> Yeah, it's just.<eos> I'm not much of a gun guy, Steph.<eos> - Become one.<eos> - Jesus, Steph!
Then why didn't you eat Mommy's breakfast?<eos> Because if I ate your mommy's breakfast, I'd end up a fat fucking bastard like everybody else in this town.<eos> Let's just pretend Uncle Zeke didn't say that, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey, Sally.
Let's just pretend Uncle Zeke didn't say that, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey, Sally.<eos> Do you mind if we drop her off at school on the way to work?<eos> No, not at all.
Little detail is known of this latest killing, but the police have identified the two remaining suspects in the First Mackey Bank robbery.<eos> Ed Burton and Andrew Sikes.<eos> The owner of the bank, Judge Dawkins, could not be reached for comment.<eos> But it's now clear that Tuesday's dramatic shoot-out at the FMB is anything but over.<eos> As for the victim, Chris Morrow.
You. Hello? Hello?<eos> So, what's the story?<eos> Looks like our bank bandits had a dispute over how to split the proceeds.<eos> Or never planned to split 'em with this Morrow guy.<eos> Oh, Chris.
Got his brain fried in a meth lab accident a few years back.<eos> Same blow-up that landed Ed Burton in the pen?<eos> That's the one.<eos> Well, that connects them.<eos> What about, uh.?
Same blow-up that landed Ed Burton in the pen?<eos> That's the one.<eos> Well, that connects them.<eos> What about, uh.?<eos> - My brother?
- You don't think they're together?<eos> - No, I never thought they were together.<eos> I think Ed was planning to rip those guys off from moment one.<eos> So what do we do now?<eos> Sikes.
I don't know what to say.<eos> I want to you admit that Ed paid you to drop the reckless manslaughter charge.<eos> I want you to admit you traded a little boy's life for a fancy car.<eos> You make it sound so simple.<eos> What about Judge Dawkins?
Nobody cares that he signed off on Ed's plea deal.<eos> We're not talking about Judge Dawkins. We're talking about my brother.<eos> We're talking about you.<eos> Okay.<eos> Fine.
We're talking about you.<eos> Okay.<eos> Fine.<eos> Ed bought me off. Okay?<eos> You happy?
I think we should have the Feds camp out here tonight, keep an eye on Steph, in case Ed gets any bright ideas.<eos> - You know, two guys he doesn't recognize.<eos> - That makes sense.<eos> - Hey, who was that?<eos> Martha?
- Yeah, sloppy Joes tonight.<eos> I love a sloppy Joe.<eos> Except, this morning, you told me you were having fried chicken, Zeke.<eos> Who was that?<eos> Your brother?
You are so beautiful.<eos> I tell you, this is way better than anything that degenerate Ed used to cook up.<eos> Ed is such a two-bit hustler.<eos> He used to cook his shit with, like, MSM, Lexapro. You name it, he used it.<eos> But this stuff.
I just gotta take a shit, that's all. - How romantic.<eos> - Oh, sorry, honey.<eos> It's not you. It's the drugs.<eos> Sometimes, these things just flush me right out.<eos> - Andy!
- Fuck Ed!<eos> He should be afraid I'm gonna kill him!<eos> You know, I just don't get it.<eos> Why are you helping him?<eos> None of your business.
You've got everything.<eos> You've got a career.<eos> In fact, I heard you're running for the goddamn Senate.<eos> What does Ed have on you?<eos> Enough.
- Andy, I'm on my knees. Please, let's just talk about it.<eos> Once you open that door, there's no going back.<eos> What the fuck? Oh!<eos> Allison, do you know where my slippers are?<eos> Allison?
God!<eos> If you tell one goddamn soul, I will fucking kill you.<eos> I was never here.<eos> Get out!<eos> Good night, Steph.
Sleep tight.<eos> Let me ask you something. Do you think my wife's hot?<eos> Yeah. Hot enough.<eos> What do you mean hot enough?<eos> My wife?
What do you mean by hot enough?<eos> - She's plenty hot. - You qualified it with enough.<eos> - She's plenty hot enough?<eos> - I said she was fuckin' hot! Fuck you.<eos> Fuckin' hotter than Margaret.
- I said she was fuckin' hot! Fuck you.<eos> Fuckin' hotter than Margaret.<eos> Oh, shit. They forgot my chalupa.<eos> - What the fuck is that?<eos> - What?
Fuckin' hotter than Margaret.<eos> Oh, shit. They forgot my chalupa.<eos> - What the fuck is that?<eos> - What?<eos> The naked kid!
Andy?<eos> Andy, are you awake?<eos> - Hey, what happened last night? - Shh!<eos> Just give me a minute.<eos> - What?
What do you mean, what fucking happened last night?<eos> - Ed fucked us is what happened.<eos> - No, he wouldn't do that.<eos> Listen, Chris, I know that something's wrong with you up in the head, but please don't say that Ed wouldn't do that when he just fucking did that!<eos> - No way.
Until tonight. You are gonna meet me at ten o'clock at Rudy's scrapyard.<eos> Okay? By then, I should know more of what's going on.<eos> Rudy's scrapyard, ten.<eos> - You have a watch?<eos> - Sure, yeah.
- Not yet, no.<eos> Sorry I'm late.<eos> I saw her coming back from the cemetery.<eos> Figured it was better than sitting in front of an empty house.<eos> Uh-huh.
Be back in a sec.<eos> You know, I'm just asking questions.<eos> You don't have to be mean.<eos> - I take it you're Sheriff Sikes?<eos> - Zeke.
- How's your shoulder, Zeke?<eos> - Eh, it hurts.<eos> Yeah, I'm sure it does.<eos> - Kurt Biltmore. This here's Kyle Walker. - Hey.<eos> Kurt, Kyle.
Yeah, I'm sure it does.<eos> - Kurt Biltmore. This here's Kyle Walker. - Hey.<eos> Kurt, Kyle.<eos> Mind if I speak first?<eos> By all means.
Kurt and I are like the B team.<eos> Well, we're like the B team to the D team.<eos> Yeah, we're the E team.<eos> So your arrangement sounds just perfect to us.<eos> All right.
- Care to elaborate?<eos> It's complicated.<eos> Let's just see what we find in Morrow's place.<eos> Mice, I'm guessing.<eos> Or a raccoon.
Let's just see what we find in Morrow's place.<eos> Mice, I'm guessing.<eos> Or a raccoon.<eos> Maybe a sheep.<eos> Chris?
Or a raccoon.<eos> Maybe a sheep.<eos> Chris?<eos> Chris, it's Zeke Sikes!<eos> Chris?
Maybe a sheep.<eos> Chris?<eos> Chris, it's Zeke Sikes!<eos> Chris?<eos> Chris?
Chris?<eos> Chris, it's Zeke Sikes!<eos> Chris?<eos> Chris?<eos> Chris, Zeke Sikes!
Chris, Zeke Sikes!<eos> If you're in there.<eos> I'm coming in!<eos> Ma'am, I'm gonna need you to get up!<eos> Chris.
Ma'am, I'm gonna need you to get up!<eos> Chris.<eos> - Hello?<eos> - Hey, Chris, it's Steph.<eos> - Steph, really?
No, no, not the same as us because he's the one that ended up with all the money.<eos> Right, well, he wants to settle up, split the cash, and then we all go our separate ways.<eos> Well.<eos> I can't go nowhere until after I meet up with Andy at ten.<eos> No, Chris, just you.
- That was pretty silly.<eos> Yeah, well. I'm a pretty silly guy.<eos> See ya!<eos> Gracias, amigos.<eos> - Adiós. - Peace.
Yeah, well. I'm a pretty silly guy.<eos> See ya!<eos> Gracias, amigos.<eos> - Adiós. - Peace.<eos> Adiós.
See ya!<eos> Gracias, amigos.<eos> - Adiós. - Peace.<eos> Adiós.<eos> - Chris!
Gracias, amigos.<eos> - Adiós. - Peace.<eos> Adiós.<eos> - Chris!<eos> - Steph?
Oh, well, that's smart.<eos> Ed's a smart guy.<eos> Listen, do you mind if I hop in the shower?<eos> You want to take a shower?<eos> Yeah. Okay.
Steph, what the hell are you doing?<eos> Chris, he's lying.<eos> Hey, give me my gun back.<eos> Give me back my gun!<eos> All right.
- But you don't know me!<eos> - I was smart once!<eos> - I have a gun in my hand!<eos> Stop! I have.<eos> Jesus, Judge.
See you soon, Judge.<eos> Rudy's scrapyard at ten.<eos> I got it. Okay.<eos> I'll see you there.<eos> Fucking asshole!
Rudy's scrapyard at ten.<eos> I got it. Okay.<eos> I'll see you there.<eos> Fucking asshole!<eos> Shh.
Then why are you doing it?<eos> - That's a stupid fucking question.<eos> - Why are you doing it?<eos> - For you.<eos> - Bullshit.
Hey.<eos> Sorry, man. Escorting our state champion quarterback from his meeting with our state champion parole officer.<eos> - Do you mind hopping' in back?<eos> - No, not at all.<eos> - Hey, Ed.
- right in your waiting mitt.<eos> - It was perfect.<eos> You were just so damn excited to finally get your hands on the football, you forgot we were at midfield.<eos> And then, uh. And then, that big-ass linebacker, uh.<eos> - Reggie Cutler. - Reggie Cutler.
My dad shows it on Thanksgiving.<eos> Those were the days, huh?<eos> - Hello?<eos> - It's me.<eos> Judge Dawkins.
Bank duty is the sheriff's job.<eos> Dawkins will give me hell if it's not me guarding his precious crop money.<eos> Plus, I don't want to ruin your night.<eos> You seeing this mysterious Wendy again?<eos> Holy shit!
- Is it getting serious?<eos> - No, it's just dinner.<eos> That's how it starts, and then the next thing you know, little Wendys running all around your house.<eos> I don't know, I don't know.<eos> - 602. - 602. - Not 206.
Yeah.<eos> Then you should call this whole thing off.<eos> Call this whole thing.<eos> What do you mean? This whole thing was your idea.<eos> Chris, Andy, Dawkins.
Don't get skittish on me now, all right?<eos> We got this.<eos> Trust me. You're gonna be singing a very different tune in a few hours when you're a very rich woman.<eos> All right, where were we, boys?<eos> - Evening, fellas.
I mean, no matter what the circumstances.<eos> That's awfully kind of you to say, Judge. Though, hopefully, tonight will just be your typical quiet night at the bank.<eos> Of course. Okay.<eos> Well, I hope you brought a crossword puzzle.<eos> Okay. Good-bye.
What the fuck do you think is happening?<eos> We're robbing a bank.<eos> I know, but inside, is it going good?<eos> Yeah, Chris. It's going real good.<eos> Super good.
We're robbing a bank.<eos> I know, but inside, is it going good?<eos> Yeah, Chris. It's going real good.<eos> Super good.<eos> Okay.
Schwarzenegger! Arnold's less successful. Brother.<eos> Fuck it! All right.<eos> Yeah, it's me!<eos> I'm gonna be long gone, anyway, by the time they get you out of that fucking vault. Huh? So, here.<eos> Good luck.
It's 86.<eos> How do you read that as a fucking eight, huh?<eos> Six, 28, 86. It's his.<eos> It's his fucking wedding anniversary.<eos> Yeah.
Yeah. I guess people really don't like dead kids, huh?<eos> Yeah, no shit.<eos> They fucking love 'em.<eos> We had some pretty good times back in the day.<eos> You and me.
I could kill you.<eos> I am on the edge right now.<eos> I'll fucking do it!<eos> Do not fucking push me, Zeke!<eos> Or what?
What? Why are you doing this?<eos> Why are you doing this, Zeke?<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Shit, what's happening? What the fuck is going on?<eos> - Justice, Ed. - Justice.
Don't you get it?<eos> He wasn't your baby.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Stop saying that.<eos> Ed.
- Why? Why?<eos> - I'm sorry, Andy. I fucked up.<eos> Oh, fuck. We're fucked, Andy. We're fucked.<eos> License and registration.<eos> - Zeke?
- Shit! Oh, shit!<eos> Fuck! - This is 019.<eos> We got an alarm signal coming from First Mackey Bank.<eos> - I'm gonna shoot him. - What?<eos> No!
We got an alarm signal coming from First Mackey Bank.<eos> - I'm gonna shoot him. - What?<eos> No!<eos> Get the. You stupid.<eos> Chris Morrow.
Shit!<eos> Shit!
Oh, let's see how the wedding goes first.<eos> You got a letter from someone.<eos> I'm pretty surprised about it.<eos> I didn't know you knew anyone in the free world.<eos> Good boy!
I didn't know you knew anyone in the free world.<eos> Good boy!<eos> Why, thank you, Ringo.<eos> Oh, my!<eos> Oh, Ringo!
Until death do us part.<eos> Frances Millner, Douglas Grotsky, take hands.<eos> You may now kiss as husband and wife.<eos> Two miles later, we're almost there.<eos> Hi.

Tells me you got something brewing up here.<eos> Sorry, do I know you?<eos> Do you mind if I say something else?<eos> I'm gonna say something else. Nobody deserves a full minute of your attention unless they're giving it back to you.<eos> Oh. Smile!
Oh. Smile!<eos> Hey, just something for you to think about.<eos> Me to you.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Um, what the fu...
Sorry, I'm... I'm having an off day.<eos> Do you ever have that?<eos> Kind of day where you think that the things that come so easy to everyone else just seem so elusive?<eos> No.<eos> Yeah, me neither.

No.<eos> Yeah, me neither.<eos> Not that you asked, but this is where I'm sitting so if you end up in the high teens, you know where to find me.<eos> Shit!<eos> Oh, shit.
Shit!<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Are you feeling all right?<eos> What do you say your name is?<eos> Megan-Ann.
Yes.<eos> Who doesn't love to read books?<eos> I do, as a normal person.<eos> What's your favorite book, Walter?<eos> Probably that one.
On, my God.<eos> Where are you from?<eos> Hi.<eos> Hellomygod.<eos> - Okay. Hi.

Can't help being a detective, it's just who I am.<eos> And you want to know what rank on the force my husband has attained?<eos> He manages a diner in Columbus, Ohio. That rank.<eos> Fill us in anyway, would you, on how exactly the bride's best friend ended up back here with the Klumps.<eos> Oldest friend.
It's no mystery, it's not a big deal.<eos> I got dumped by Francie's brother, Teddy Millner, the best man.<eos> That tall drink of shit over there at table one you can barely see. God, look at him.<eos> That guy is exactly who you think he'd be.<eos> Yeah, just a selfish jerk.
You're right.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You're right.<eos> It's none of my business if you cheated on me with her.<eos> What?
Yeah?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Before you ruin all this for Francie.<eos> I don't have a ferry ticket till tomorrow, anyway.<eos> Swim.
Fine.<eos> Just don't make a scene.<eos> Why does everyone keep saying I do that?<eos> Hey, Jerry Kepp.<eos> Uh-huh. Just a hypothetical.
Okay, I'm sorry.<eos> Bina, stand up. Bina, please, stand up right now, please.<eos> Why?<eos> I will give you 20 unhypothetical dollars if you stand up right now.<eos> All right, then.
Bina, stand up. Bina, please, stand up right now, please.<eos> Why?<eos> I will give you 20 unhypothetical dollars if you stand up right now.<eos> All right, then.<eos> Okay?
All right, then.<eos> Okay?<eos> What?<eos> Honey.<eos> Shit.
Okay?<eos> What?<eos> Honey.<eos> Shit.<eos> What a shame.
Sometimes, first sticks.<eos> Sometimes, it doesn't.<eos> He listened to every voicemail I sent, so what does that tell you?<eos> Tells me you don't know when to stop calling.<eos> Hey, Bina.
Well, Henry Grotsky owns five diners in Central Ohio.<eos> We own a diner in Central Ohio.<eos> Everyone who owns a diner in Central Ohio is Facebook friends.<eos> You'd know that if you paid attention.<eos> Tom Fo.

I did the table assignments with Francie.<eos> How could the person who did the table assignments have no one else here?<eos> I planned half the wedding.<eos> Table one is Francie, Doug and everyone who actually matters including Teddy Millner, the best man-child and Nikki Carmichael, the second-choice maid of honor.<eos> Table two, Francie's hideous dad...
How could the person who did the table assignments have no one else here?<eos> I planned half the wedding.<eos> Table one is Francie, Doug and everyone who actually matters including Teddy Millner, the best man-child and Nikki Carmichael, the second-choice maid of honor.<eos> Table two, Francie's hideous dad...<eos> Roger?
What's happening now?<eos> Four, Doug's kooky college friends.<eos> Five, grandparents, no comment.<eos> Six, Doug's dad's military buddies.<eos> Seven, decent cousins.
Six, Doug's dad's military buddies.<eos> Seven, decent cousins.<eos> Eight, indecent cousins including Infamous Kate, the Millner family nymphomaniac.<eos> Where is eight now?<eos> Nine, Francie's scintillating work.
I gave her, her favorite toy in the world.<eos> A golden bird that she so loved, I bet she still has it now.<eos> Does that sound like a person they would put at a table of people they don't care about?<eos> It sounds like someone who was invited to a wedding because Francie's mother found out she was paying $200 a plate for the groom's nanny and wanted to settle the score.<eos> Oh, and me too.
Welcome for their first dance Mr. and Mrs. Douglas Grotsky!<eos> Get this party started!<eos> Hi.<eos> No.<eos> Of course not.
Mr. Pfaffler? May I have a word with your daughter?<eos> Oh, this is not my daughter.<eos> She's just my tablemate today.<eos> Can I ask what her name is?<eos> Megan-Ann.
I thought we were gonna be murdered there for a second.<eos> Oh, my God, the lighting in here is brutal!<eos> God!<eos> My dance number is next and I cannot look like my hair just got humped by a hurricane.<eos> Hello, Carol.
All right. We have to catch up one of these years, when my brain is made of less liquid.<eos> We will die laughing. One of these years.<eos> My daughter is a goddamn married woman!<eos> The funny thing is, the bloke doesn't realize he's on the ninth green with his pants around his ankles!<eos> Funny.
Oh, you are?<eos> Ever heard of a guy named Donny Haczyk?<eos> Yes. He's a knobhead.<eos> - He's a what?<eos> - A knobhead.
Why can't I just be here to reminisce on the early days of Bina and Jerry?<eos> Please.<eos> I give up.<eos> Where's Mr. Manny?<eos> Mr. Manny?
How did I not just get kissed?<eos> It happens more often than you think.<eos> Uh... I'm Eloise, by the way.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Huck.
It happens more often than you think.<eos> Uh... I'm Eloise, by the way.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Huck.<eos> Huck?
Huck, we are in a grand ballroom full of tables.<eos> I'm at the very worst one.<eos> Would you care to join me?<eos> I shouldn't.<eos> Sure.
maybe she'd just be always ready to forgive him.<eos> Come on up here, Nikki.<eos> Save me, please.<eos> I don't know what I'm saying anymore.<eos> Maid of honor toast time!
Which I am.<eos> Are you okay? You looked like you got sick.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Please get lost. Excuse me.<eos> Hello. Jerry Kepp.
And I was so scared of losing you that when you told me you were pregnant, lasked if you wanted to keep the kid.<eos> I'm ridiculous in a million ways.<eos> I am. I know that.<eos> But I can't spend my whole life disappointing you" No, he doesn't get... on.<eos> Shit.
But I can't spend my whole life disappointing you" No, he doesn't get... on.<eos> Shit.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Hey, stop.<eos> Teddy!
I'm sorry.<eos> Hey, stop.<eos> Teddy!<eos> Stop!<eos> Teddy!
Teddy!<eos> Stop!<eos> Teddy!<eos> Leave me alone.<eos> No, Teddy!
Leave me alone.<eos> No, Teddy!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> No, we can fix this. We can fix this.<eos> No, Teddy.
No, we can fix this. We can fix this.<eos> No, Teddy.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I've been hit.<eos> - Shit.
I'm sorry.<eos> I've been hit.<eos> - Shit.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, shit.
I was in prison because I stole $125,000 from the father of the bride.<eos> It was not a table of honor.<eos> I have a bag of dope in my room.<eos> Room 115 for the dope in case any of you feel that a bag of dope would be fun to do.<eos> Not you.
It was not a table of honor.<eos> I have a bag of dope in my room.<eos> Room 115 for the dope in case any of you feel that a bag of dope would be fun to do.<eos> Not you.<eos> And not you.
And not you.<eos> You two can drop by and choose something from the mini fridge.<eos> That was the worst invitation to anything I've ever received, ever.<eos> Is your room this way? Or are you just following us?<eos> Who, me?
No.<eos> I don't know, unless Uncle Roger is lurking around outside the door, I mean...<eos> Is it Uncle Roger?<eos> Nope.<eos> Hi.
You got a table with a lot of your friends<eos> Waitin' for your ship to come in<eos> Folks like me on the job from nine to five<eos> Concierge, please.<eos> Hi.
Who else would've wanted that?<eos> You asked my father if you could.<eos> You renamed the family diner after yourself.<eos> That was your idea.<eos> What?
You just called him a sweetheart!<eos> He was a lovely bloke.<eos> He was always nice to me.<eos> Except for when he made me go to prison.<eos> Renzo.
It's pretty dumb.<eos> No, come on.<eos> Yeah, it is. It is.<eos> My mom believed it would ever so slightly convey my sexual prowess.<eos> Clonk.
Now here we are in heaven<eos> 'Cause you are mine<eos> At last<eos> Fuck.<eos> Here, Ringo!
At last<eos> Fuck.<eos> Here, Ringo!<eos> Wonder how my daughter's gonna feel not having a dad?<eos> Daughter?
I should go back in.<eos> Tell Francie about the cake.<eos> Let's sit out for a little while.<eos> The world feels almost perfect right now.<eos> Crap!
Maybe back in the ballroom after the happy couple is gone and I'm upstairs in the room?<eos> You're gonna sell our diner to Henry Grotsky.<eos> You don't out-detective me, Bina Kepp.<eos> I came to have an affair.<eos> No way.
I came to have an affair.<eos> No way.<eos> I know you.<eos> Bina, an affair?<eos> Bina!
I should just let you know that I've got a little bit of eczema behind my knees.<eos> And, um, oh, last year I had a cold sore, but that was because Jalapeno was using my washcloth.<eos> And not just on his face.<eos> But, yeah, otherwise, I'm all fine so just let me know when you want to start the intercourse.<eos> What?

But no. No'?<eos> Was it talking about Jalapeno washing his testicles that ruined the mood?<eos> Sure.<eos> How bad is it?<eos> Pot.
Denny, who's that man there, he said that there's no one registered under the name you asked about.<eos> Did you say the right name?<eos> Yeah, Denny. It's on his nametag. I saw it.<eos> Right. Not him.<eos> Oh, Fo, yes.
Okay. Right.<eos> No Fo.<eos> Sorry.<eos> God, that's so weird.<eos> Walter?
That's disgusting.<eos> This wedding is over for you.<eos> I need you to give me the phone number of somebody that I can call to get you out of here right now. Oh!<eos> So... Mr. Pfaffler said he's gonna call my mom.<eos> And the girl?
Is this the guy you meant?<eos> Nope.<eos> I'm pregnant with his baby, but not the guy I'm looking for.<eos> Wow. One cigarette break and you miss an awful lot, right?<eos> This guy?
Right.<eos> Okay, let's go.<eos> Come on! Yeah.<eos> Nice bit of cake?<eos> Oh, Nanny Jo, everybody...
No. It's the same wedding no matter what table you're at, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm so glad you came over because I was just saying I'm so tired.<eos> Gonna head out. Oh. Okay.<eos> Yeah.
You look so beautiful.<eos> Thank you.<eos> And congratulations or best wishes or whatever you're supposed to say.<eos> And this was great.<eos> BYE, guys.
I know I'm probably the last person in the world you ever want to see again.<eos> And I get that. Totally understand.<eos> And it will probably suck for you to have to see me again under any circumstances which is why I wanted to say that whatever happened between us and however it ended I think, you know, I could be a really good dad, probably, if you'll just...<eos> So, that's it.<eos> Goodbye.
I don't know how you fixed this, but it really meant a lot.<eos> Well, it's been so great to catch up with you all.<eos> I hope you all got to dance to your heart's content.<eos> Do you still have the golden bird?<eos> Oh, Nanny Jo.
It wouldn't have been the same without you.<eos> Please proceed to the docks to see off Mr. and Mrs. Douglas Grotsky.<eos> What is it with you people?<eos> Teddy Millner is the sweetest child I've ever known.<eos> - Teddy!

Well, I didn't word it right.<eos> No, you're okay.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Hey, I got these.<eos> Room 430.
Maybe in a couple of years.<eos> Wait, really?<eos> Okay, it's booked.<eos> A few years from now.<eos> Room 430.
She means cake.<eos> Oh. Then, yeah.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Is it good?<eos> Yeah, really good.
Oh. Then, yeah.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Is it good?<eos> Yeah, really good.<eos> Oh, shit.
Yeah, really good.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> What did you say?<eos> Oh, my Lord!<eos> Holy shit!
That's really good.<eos> Can we do that?<eos> Let's do that.<eos> Goodnight, Mom.<eos> Goodnight, Teddy.
Can we do that?<eos> Let's do that.<eos> Goodnight, Mom.<eos> Goodnight, Teddy.<eos> Bye, Carol.
The evidence is mounting up against you, Walter.<eos> Renzo, your study buddy is here!<eos> Hey. Here's your mail.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Hi.
Hey. Here's your mail.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Hi.<eos> Please don't slam the door, even for that.<eos> Ringo?
Sorry. Thank you.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Okay, so this is the last batch of...<eos> Teddy, where's the baby?<eos> Baby. Oh, man!
Look at this.<eos> Baby cakes.
I love you.<eos> Bless you.<eos> What do you have to say?<eos> There's the monkey.<eos> Mama.
- I got to get out of here.<eos> - Jeez.<eos> Okay, darling. How about you colored it up for your mother. Okay.<eos> I'll get it later.<eos> - Crawfish Friday?
- Crawfish are good.<eos> Just peel the tail back and suck all the juice out the head.<eos> - You suck juice out of the head? - Yeah.<eos> Here's a Belgian waffle and bacon.<eos> Where the hash browns?
She might have overslept.<eos> Can you do a double?<eos> Can't, I got plans with my kid.<eos> Call Alan.<eos> Okay, hot coffee. No, no, no.
Come on. - Okay.<eos> Can I get my face painted?<eos> How about we wait until the line is a little shorter?<eos> We'll come back, okay?<eos> - Marco.

- Polo.<eos> - How old your boy?<eos> - Six.<eos> He obviously likes to hide.<eos> Marco.
Frankie, listen.<eos> I'm gonna have to go over there and take this phone call, okay?<eos> It's really important.<eos> Don't move, okay? - Marco.<eos> - Polo.
Well, he can't have that.<eos> I mean, can he?<eos> My batteries are gonna die, Mr. Jackson.<eos> If it does, I'll call you back, okay? - Marco.<eos> - Polo.
Yes, yes, I have a job.<eos> I have a regular job.<eos> Is that even gonna matter to the court?<eos> Well, yeah, he's in real estate. And his girlfriend is a pediatrician and I'm a waitress. So you do the math.<eos> Marco.

Are you cute.<eos> - You aren't here by yourself, are you?<eos> - No.<eos> My name is Margo. What's your name?<eos> - Frankie.
Go, she's scared.<eos> She thinks you're lost.<eos> I don't know, because she said...<eos> Oh, God.<eos> The police.
Pull that van over now!<eos> This is your last warning!<eos> Pull over!<eos> They got my son!<eos> Frankie!
So now what's the plan?<eos> You don't really even have a plan, do you?<eos> You have no idea what to even do right now.<eos> You need her... You need her to tell you what to do, don't you?<eos> Shit!
- My son has been kidnapped! - What?<eos> - Repeat after me!<eos> 80's Green Mustang GT!<eos> - Call the police right now!<eos> Oh, no.
80's Green Mustang GT!<eos> - Call the police right now!<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Please still here.<eos> Frankie!

Ma'am? Ma'am?<eos> Excuse me, did you see a man with a little boy?<eos> Is that your jacket?<eos> That's your jacket.<eos> Frankie?
I said no!<eos> Fuck you!<eos> No!<eos> Oh, God.<eos> No!
Where's my shells?<eos> You had to keep coming, didn't you?<eos> Where's my son?<eos> Where's my son!<eos> Terrence Vicky?
- My son has been kidnapped.<eos> And I'm in the house where I think they're keeping him.<eos> We think we found you.<eos> Can you verified your address?<eos> Yes. 125, route 77.
Would you let me know when you find a safe place to hide? Ma'am, are you there?<eos> Ma'am? - Hang up, hang up.<eos> Terry, are you back?<eos> Terry, was that you on the phone?<eos> Terry!
Ma'am? - Hang up, hang up.<eos> Terry, are you back?<eos> Terry, was that you on the phone?<eos> Terry!<eos> Frankie.

- I live next door.<eos> I heard gunshots.<eos> Where's Margo?<eos> - In the water.<eos> - What?
- Those are kids. More abducted kids.<eos> Yeah, they're up there in that hole.<eos> Dear Lord.<eos> We have to get them down.<eos> Hey, you two.
Promise.<eos> Jakob.<eos> I will always be your mother.<eos> _ NO.<eos> Carlotta.
I will always be your mother.<eos> _ NO.<eos> Carlotta.<eos> - Caflotta...<eos> - Arrivederci.
I hardly know the woman I see.<eos> Her name is Verena.<eos> She is alone.<eos> She remembers all of them.<eos> Every parting-
She is alone.<eos> She remembers all of them.<eos> Every parting-<eos> Her life is measured out in goodbyes.<eos> Each one harder than the last.
I know a little something of what it feels to be apart from the world.<eos> I lost my mother when I was a little bit younger than you... and my father when I was a little bit older.<eos> It's a lovely day.<eos> I have an idea.<eos> Jakob?

- You spent time with Jakob this morning.<eos> - Yes.<eos> And did you observe anything?<eos> I need to understand what he has been through.<eos> Malvina.
- Yes.<eos> And did you observe anything?<eos> I need to understand what he has been through.<eos> Malvina.<eos> Malvina Rivi.
They would sit here and play together for hours.<eos> Hmm. - He chooses not to speak?<eos> - Oh... this... this must be that incredible sensitivity of yours?<eos> I mean, there is no injury?<eos> No incapacity?
He'll take you there if you wish.<eos> Yes.<eos> I'd like that very much.<eos> Let me.<eos> Per favore.
If it was, then all you've done is tell me you're afraid.<eos> Ja...<eos> Jakob.<eos> Jakob, what is it?<eos> Jakob.
Jakob.<eos> Jakob, what is it?<eos> Jakob.<eos> - Ah! - What?<eos> Jakob, no!
Jakob.<eos> - Ah! - What?<eos> Jakob, no!<eos> Wait! Wait!<eos> Jakob? Hey!
I have been misled about what is required.<eos> I must consider whether I am properly qualified.<eos> You're just like the others.<eos> I await your decision.<eos> Jakob.

I care about you.<eos> What is it?<eos> You wish to leave?<eos> Jakob?<eos> Lucia.
You wish to leave?<eos> Jakob?<eos> Lucia.<eos> Ugolina.<eos> Angelica.
She must have... spoken about the future before she died... about the wonderful things that lie ahead for you.<eos> Try to remember what she said.<eos> And imagine what she might say now if she could see you.<eos> Buongiorno.<eos> Signore.
But he's waited long enough.<eos> Surely that is clear to anyone.<eos> When he speaks... where will you go?<eos> To the next place.<eos> Lonely child.
If you wish.<eos> It's my wife.<eos> She was the worst possible model - restless, complaining.<eos> She was the worst, and also the best.<eos> And this one?
Perhaps it would signify hope.<eos> Yes.<eos> Perhaps.<eos> Hello?<eos> Lilia?
Try this on.<eos> See how it fits, huh?<eos> Brava.<eos> Bellisima.<eos> Ah, perfetto.
No.<eos> No.<eos> Put it on.<eos> Put that one away.<eos> Signore.
I have something to ask.<eos> You may very likely refuse.<eos> What is it?<eos> I saw this afternoon something I had previously failed to notice, certain... resemblances between you... you and my wife.<eos> 'ZZZ
Your work here will be unaffected.<eos> Look at yourself, how beautiful you are.<eos> Your left leg forward.<eos> Your hand.<eos> Yes, your hand.

Why would she speak to you and not to her husband? !<eos> Please don't send me away.<eos> Please.<eos> I must do what is best, above all... for Jakob.<eos> Jakob!
Please don't send me away.<eos> Please.<eos> I must do what is best, above all... for Jakob.<eos> Jakob!<eos> Jakob.

No, Jakob needs you.<eos> Please.<eos> I'm so afraid.<eos> Lilia... where is she?<eos> ' Who?
Please.<eos> I'm so afraid.<eos> Lilia... where is she?<eos> ' Who?<eos> Lilia.
What do you mean?<eos> Where is she?<eos> She's dead.<eos> On the day of Malvina's funeral, she put stones in her pockets and walked into the lake.<eos> Verena.

Did she just call me cute, Kingston?<eos> I believe she did, Edgecomb. Mmm-mmm.<eos> Al, Linds doesn't do "cute." No.<eos> It's not in her lexicon. Lexicon?<eos> Nice word choice.
That is so sweet.<eos> No glove, no love.<eos> You hear me?<eos> Take it! Take it!<eos> Okay, okay...

I saw this video about chaos in the universe...<eos> How a bird flapping its wings in South America can create a major rainstorm in New York.<eos> Like how one person can watch a pretentious video about chaos while three other people actually die of boredom.<eos> It wasn't a YouTube tutorial, so you guys wouldn't get it anyway.<eos> Samantha Kingston.

Don't forget to pee before and after.<eos> Guys, guys, sociopath, 12 o'clock.<eos> Oh, God. Does she know what a brush is?<eos> No.<eos> Norma Bates!
"Maybe next year, but probably not."<eos> That's it, guys!<eos> It kinda looks like you put it on your cheeks. It's the same color.<eos> Yeah. That's the point.<eos> Mmm.
You actually like him.<eos> Right. Yes.<eos> Everyone wants to hook up with him.<eos> Tonight, everything changes.<eos> That face.
Baes!<eos> What are you doing? What do you think you're doing?<eos> Fart's house is actually kinda nice.<eos> If I had known, I would have stopped calling him Danny DeVito all year.<eos> Sam and you.

It's Saturday.<eos> Mommy, Sammy won't get up!<eos> Don't make me come up there.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Sexy lady!
Sorry.<eos> I was FaceTiming with Patrick till, like, 3:00.<eos> Speaking of which, are you nervous for tonight?<eos> What?<eos> You, Rob, his flannel sheets?
Come on. It's Cupid Day.<eos> Seriously?<eos> Okay, this was maybe funny the first bazillion times you did it.<eos> It's still funny.<eos> Yeah, baby!
It's so beautiful.<eos> I'm in heteronormative hell.<eos> Thank you, girls. Thank you.<eos> Okay, okay, let's hope third time's the charm.<eos> Yo, Sam.
You don't want to waste the first night you go full womanhood.<eos> Okay, you sure they look good?<eos> I just really don't want to look like I'm trying too hard, you know?<eos> You're fine.<eos> Such a weird day.
I just really don't want to look like I'm trying too hard, you know?<eos> You're fine.<eos> Such a weird day.<eos> Like how?<eos> Just weird.
I'm sorry! Don't. Don't do that.<eos> I'm gonna go find Patrick, okay?<eos> What?<eos> I'll be right back!<eos> Sam!
What?<eos> I'll be right back!<eos> Sam!<eos> Hey, you made it!<eos> Sam. Sam.
Rob, I need to talk to you. What?<eos> About what? What's up?<eos> I'm feeling pranked.<eos> Tonight was supposed to be our special night...<eos> No, no, no, no, no.
About what? What's up?<eos> I'm feeling pranked.<eos> Tonight was supposed to be our special night...<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> Rob? What?
I don't feel good. I'm freaking out.<eos> It's always something.<eos> Can we go talk some...<eos> It's always something...<eos> Where? Okay, Sam. Okay.
Yeah? In Patrick's mouth, maybe.<eos> You seem a little guilty.<eos> Were you with Rob, you hussy?<eos> Skank.<eos> Harlot.
Oh, my God.<eos> What's she doing here?<eos> Watch this.<eos> You're a bitch!<eos> Just like your mother.
Just like your mother.<eos> No wonder Daddy left. Huh?<eos> - You're a bitch, too. - What? You're a drunk.<eos> You're just pathetic.<eos> Juliet...
Just pick something.<eos> You're trouble. You always have to pee.<eos> 'Cause she drinks too much.<eos> That, and she has the bladder of a baby squirrel.<eos> The truck.
Stop it.<eos> Let go!<eos> Mommy, Sammy won't get up!<eos> It wasn't until then that I allowed myself to think the worst.<eos> Sam?
Okay. Well, I'll let Lindsay know that you're going in late.<eos> But I have to be at work by 10:00.<eos> Thank you for driving me.<eos> Sure.<eos> Sammy...
Mmm. I don't know. I wanna stay in.<eos> Like we used to.<eos> Okay, but the only reason we stayed in was because we weren't invited to any senior parties.<eos> I just, bottom line, don't want to have to deal with that today.<eos> Okay?
Oh, my God. That devilish grin, though.<eos> Why did he give me that... What did you say?<eos> Relax, I just told him that you got your period.<eos> That's a good one.<eos> Yes.
So, that's a maybe, or...<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Well, I'll take that "No" as a "Maybe."<eos> So, maybe I'll see you tonight.<eos> Oh, God.
Don't go emo on us.<eos> Juliet Sykes is dead.<eos> She killed herself.<eos> But nothing happened to her at the party.<eos> How totally insane.
This is my life.<eos> I'll do whatever the hell I want with it.<eos> Dan, can you just jump in here, please? Look, Sam...<eos> That's so disrespectful to talk to your mom...<eos> Hey, Sam!
That's it!<eos> You are grounded!<eos> Grounded?<eos> I'm already grounded.<eos> Samantha!
Maybe I was alive and in hell.<eos> But it didn't matter.<eos> Nothing mattered anymore.<eos> What are you wearing?<eos> Funny.
What the hell is your problem today, Sam?<eos> You guys, don't fight. Just drop it.<eos> What, you don't agree?<eos> Leave her out of it.<eos> Why?
"Oh, my God! She's such a know-it-all."<eos> "She just loves the sound of her own voice."<eos> "Hope Elody doesn't puke in my car again" "and make it smell like alcoholic."<eos> Stop it, Sam.<eos> Out.
You're not.<eos> My patience, however, is at its breaking point.<eos> Take a seat. Please.<eos> If you insist.<eos> Okay.
My patience, however, is at its breaking point.<eos> Take a seat. Please.<eos> If you insist.<eos> Okay.<eos> Sisyphus.
Take a seat. Please.<eos> If you insist.<eos> Okay.<eos> Sisyphus.<eos> Sisyphus.
I can walk in them just fine, thank you.<eos> Aw, you need a pair of these.<eos> Comfiest shoes I ever owned.<eos> Really?<eos> All right, your loss.
Aw, you need a pair of these.<eos> Comfiest shoes I ever owned.<eos> Really?<eos> All right, your loss.<eos> Whatever.
'Cause I'm gay?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Isn't that how it always works out?<eos> There's somebody laughing, there's somebody being laughed at.<eos> Right.
Get this bitch on a leash!<eos> I love you.<eos> Is that what you wanted to hear?<eos> Go back to the ward, you psycho bitch!<eos> Sam?
Not, like, with me.<eos> Somewhere else. I'll be somewhere else.<eos> Bed completely to yourself.<eos> The Kent McFuller master suite.<eos> Yeah?
Somewhere else. I'll be somewhere else.<eos> Bed completely to yourself.<eos> The Kent McFuller master suite.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Okay.
But this is my voice.<eos> How will kids even know it's me talking?<eos> When I was in the fifth grade, this girl used to sing this song.<eos> She smells like manure and she lived in the sewer.<eos> Samantha Kingston.
When I was in the fifth grade, this girl used to sing this song.<eos> She smells like manure and she lived in the sewer.<eos> Samantha Kingston.<eos> Who did that?<eos> Lindsay.
Mom and I had a fight, and I was mad at her in the moment, but I didn't... I didn't think that she'd actually stay away.<eos> Look at that.<eos> That's just the outside, how pretty it was. Oh, my gosh. Look at you guys.<eos> - Can you send those to me?<eos> - Aw! So cute!
I do. Of course.<eos> Then your daughter got too cool, so...<eos> I'm just kidding.<eos> Can we go watch the pizza?<eos> Okay.
It's like waking up in...<eos> In the middle of the sun.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I hope you don't think that it's weird that I'm here with you right now.<eos> Sam, um...
Sam, wait, I...<eos> Oh, my God, Sam, did you see that?<eos> Did you see where Juliet went?<eos> Juliet, stop!<eos> Juliet!
Did you see where Juliet went?<eos> Juliet, stop!<eos> Juliet!<eos> Wait!<eos> Juliet!
Juliet, stop!<eos> Juliet!<eos> Wait!<eos> Juliet!<eos> Juliet!
Wait!<eos> Juliet!<eos> Juliet!<eos> Juliet, wait!<eos> Juliet!
She was so upset.<eos> She was so upset, she started wetting the bed.<eos> You remember the name you all gave me in fifth grade?<eos> The name Lindsay gave me?<eos> "Mellow Yellow."
Remember that?<eos> You remember the camping trip when I supposedly peed in my sleeping bag?<eos> Lindsay's the one who peed.<eos> When everyone asked what happened, she just pointed her finger at me and screamed, "She did it."<eos> Juliet...
Please let me help you.<eos> It doesn't matter now.<eos> It's like your Val-a-gram always said...<eos> "Maybe next year, but..." "Probably not."<eos> Juliet.
Yeah.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Auditioning for a Tampax commercial?<eos> Let's go.<eos> Yeah, baby!
Yeah, baby!<eos> Nice tits!<eos> Yes.<eos> You know how I like it.<eos> Hey, Elody.
Always.<eos> You know I'm a down-ass bitch.<eos> You are.<eos> Hey, I'm down, too.<eos> Okay.
And you're passionate, and you are driven.<eos> Did someone swallow Oprah this morning?<eos> I love you, Linds.<eos> I love you because you're the kind of friend that toilet-papers Jason Foster's house for a week straight all by herself just because he said that I was a bad kisser.<eos> Asshole.
Sisyphus fails every time, but he still thinks that he'll be able to push that boulder uphill.<eos> He's imprisoned by his own hubris.<eos> The only way to escape is to change.<eos> Be careful.<eos> Sam. Hey.
And, um, I have something I want to tell you later.<eos> A secret.<eos> Later?<eos> Okay.<eos> Yes. Okay.
Nonetheless, very shocking.<eos> Sociopath, 12 o'clock.<eos> Does it smell like pee in here?<eos> Stop.<eos> Norma Bates!
That was yesterday.<eos> Hey, Linds.<eos> All right, well, let's do this!<eos> Linds.<eos> What?
I am sorry. You said that.<eos> I'm sorry, but I have to come with you.<eos> Leave me alone!<eos> I can't.<eos> Sam! Sam!
Stop. You stop.<eos> You don't know me.<eos> You could never understand.<eos> You have a choice, Juliet. Not everybody gets that.<eos> Sam!
- Good morning, Miss.<eos> It's a beautiful day.<eos> Good morning.<eos> - Hello. Welcome.<eos> - Good morning.
- Hello. Welcome.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Enjoy yourselves today.<eos> Good morning.

Good morning, sweetheart.<eos> Good morning.<eos> How's our girl today?<eos> No problems today, Miss.<eos> Hello, old Kasia.
Oh, she's breathing!<eos> Oh! She's breathing!<eos> You beauty!<eos> She's beautiful!<eos> Amazing!
You are a wonder, Punia.<eos> You are Eve in her garden.<eos> It's late.<eos> Let's go home.<eos> - Good morning.
You are Eve in her garden.<eos> It's late.<eos> Let's go home.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> - Good morning.
It's not good, Jan, I'm telling you.<eos> I don't want Rys to live that way.<eos> Please, I want to stay here. In Warsaw.<eos> All right.<eos> Rys?
Mama!<eos> Evacuate the zoo immediately!<eos> This is the Polish Army.<eos> Wild animals are loose.<eos> Emergency!
Evacuate the zoo immediately!<eos> This is the Polish Army.<eos> Wild animals are loose.<eos> Emergency!<eos> Emergency!
No!<eos> No, Mama!<eos> Excuse me, where is the train to Zalesie?<eos> No trains running today!<eos> No trains today!
Excuse me, where is the train to Zalesie?<eos> No trains running today!<eos> No trains today!<eos> Leave the station immediately.<eos> Papa!
Let's go home.<eos> Hey. Maybe you'd like to fly.<eos> Come.<eos> Come, Punia.<eos> Pancho!
Let's go.<eos> They're using our enclosures as an armory.<eos> The country's completely overrun.<eos> I was raised with these people.<eos> Jews, Gentiles.
I was raised with these people.<eos> Jews, Gentiles.<eos> It didn't matter to my family.<eos> It never mattered to me.<eos> Guten Tag, meine Herren.
- soap... - No.<eos> No.<eos> It can't be true.<eos> The animals?<eos> All of them?
I thought I saw her.<eos> I must have been mistaken.<eos> Have it stuffed and mounted.<eos> Keep moving, children.<eos> - Dr. Korczak.
I'd like to keep my insect collection here with you.<eos> I can't take it with me.<eos> I want it to be safe.<eos> It's my life's work, you know that.<eos> Of course, Szymon, yes.
Thank you, Jan. Thank you.<eos> We have room.<eos> We have the storeroom upstairs.<eos> We could hide Magda there.<eos> Antonina.
And they want to use the zoo as a way station.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> A place to hide Jews, until safe houses can be found for them.<eos> A friend is different, one friend.<eos> But more than one?
But more than one?<eos> That's dangerous, Jan. You said it yourself.<eos> They're starving, Antonina.<eos> Two kilometers away. They are trapped and starving like rats in a cellar.<eos> How many?
How many?<eos> Impossible to say.<eos> And for how long?<eos> They'd be our guests until we found them refuge.<eos> A human zoo.
I certainly see your point.<eos> Your zoo's been of value.<eos> That's very true.<eos> Your bison was exquisite.<eos> A perfect specimen, and a terrible loss.
I am to start a breeding program this summer.<eos> You're going to breed bison?<eos> No, that plan has no scope, no ambition.<eos> No, I intend to breed aurochsen from the bison.<eos> Aurochsen.
I think the pigs will work.<eos> I'm sure Göring will be pleased with the idea.<eos> And what an irony, a trayf farm fed by Jewish garbage.<eos> And right under their noses.<eos> Cheers!
I'm going to do it, that's all.<eos> The feed's ready for the pigs.<eos> I have to go.<eos> See you later, darling.<eos> Halt!
It's the pig farmer of Warsaw.<eos> Up! Up!<eos> This looks good.<eos> This is fine.<eos> Zabiński!
Very quiet.<eos> Here, go in, go, go.<eos> Stay down. Good girl.<eos> Move over.<eos> Halt!
But I promise you, you're going to be all right.<eos> I'll stay with you if you like.<eos> I'm right here.<eos> Now.<eos> Good work, Jan.
I'm right here.<eos> Now.<eos> Good work, Jan.<eos> - The army's waiting for them in Łomża.<eos> - Good luck.
They're not like people.<eos> We live in a zoo.<eos> That's where you are, in a zoo.<eos> Most of the animals are gone now because of the bombing.<eos> But this one,
But if you hear the piano in the day, you must hide.<eos> It's so cold today.<eos> Would you please make a double batch of soup?<eos> We'll mate them this summer.<eos> - Mmm-hmm.
Urszula means "she-bear."<eos> Did you know that?<eos> Yes.<eos> My father used to say it.<eos> Good evening.
Good evening.<eos> Hello.<eos> It's almost bearable today.<eos> Herr Heck, Miss.<eos> What a surprise.
What a surprise.<eos> I wasn't expecting you today.<eos> A good surprise, I hope.<eos> Of course.<eos> Always a good surprise.
Well, put them on, please.<eos> You're not a child.<eos> Upstairs!<eos> Yes?<eos> - Dr. Zabiński?
I've come to see the bugs.<eos> Szymon died, you see.<eos> Szymon and I went hunting many times. I'm a bit of a bug man myself.<eos> An amateur entomologist, you might say.<eos> Wonderful.
Szymon died, you see.<eos> Szymon and I went hunting many times. I'm a bit of a bug man myself.<eos> An amateur entomologist, you might say.<eos> Wonderful.<eos> What an extraordinary collection.
What do you want?<eos> I'm sorry, Dr. Zabiński.<eos> My apologies, Dr. Kleinhauser.<eos> Just keep walking.<eos> Magda!
Did he...<eos> Did he bathe you, Punia?<eos> Did he wash your hands?<eos> No.<eos> Jan.
Did he bathe you, Punia?<eos> Did he wash your hands?<eos> No.<eos> Jan.<eos> Jan.
No.<eos> Jan.<eos> Jan.<eos> We were nearly caught today.<eos> Antonina?
You have always been so good to me, Miss.<eos> You and your husband.<eos> Now, I'll be good to you.<eos> Be careful.<eos> Attention.
You and your husband.<eos> Now, I'll be good to you.<eos> Be careful.<eos> Attention.<eos> Attention.
It was the only way to do this.<eos> I never agreed to this.<eos> Never.<eos> - To what?<eos> - This...
You stay hidden here, safe and sound.<eos> You don't know.<eos> You don't know.<eos> Grandparents, women, children.<eos> The littlest of children.
And here you are, fooling with that man.<eos> Jan, don't you see?<eos> He owns us.<eos> He owns us now.<eos> Antonina.
Jan, don't you see?<eos> He owns us.<eos> He owns us now.<eos> Antonina.<eos> Antonina.
He owns us.<eos> He owns us now.<eos> Antonina.<eos> Antonina.<eos> - Mrs. Anzelowna?
They're burning the ghetto.<eos> Here's cash and papers.<eos> We'll move Mrs. Mayzel to Bramki.<eos> They're taking Mrs. Poznanska to Foksal Street.<eos> - Jan...
- Be quiet.<eos> Burn it down.<eos> Where's your mother?<eos> She's at the doctor's.<eos> And your father?
Your papa's in Zalesie.<eos> Good boy for reminding me.<eos> Your parents must be proud of you.<eos> Tell them they should be proud of you.<eos> - Heil Hitler.
Good boy for reminding me.<eos> Your parents must be proud of you.<eos> Tell them they should be proud of you.<eos> - Heil Hitler.<eos> - Heil Hitler.
The German Army must not stand.<eos> Follow me.<eos> This is Warsaw calling. This is Warsaw calling.<eos> Go!<eos> Aim.
Where does he hear them? Um...<eos> I don't know.<eos> - People come and go all the time...<eos> - Who comes and goes?<eos> Soldiers and guards and...
You hid it well.<eos> But I wonder what else have you been hiding from me?<eos> What have you been up to, Frau Zabińska, in your little zoo?<eos> Excuse me, please!<eos> Jerzyk!
Jerzyk!<eos> We have to get them out.<eos> Herr Heck is coming. The bombing is coming in.<eos> Herr Heck wants you out.<eos> Everyone!
Come back when the war's over, promise me.<eos> She's coming with us!<eos> Go quickly, boys! - Rys, get in the truck.<eos> - No, I'm not going.<eos> - Rys!
Drop your weapon!<eos> I said, drop your weapon now.<eos> Please.<eos> Don't.<eos> How many?
Mama!<eos> No, Lutz!<eos> No!<eos> Ah! No!<eos> Rys.
You're home, hmm?<eos> Rys, look.<eos> Look.<eos> It's a strawberry.<eos> Jan!
Rys, look.<eos> Look.<eos> It's a strawberry.<eos> Jan!<eos> Jan!

When you put your mind to something, that was that.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's good for getting things done.<eos> It's not so good for relationships.<eos> Okay, well...

A sense of camaraderie with our friends and neighbors.<eos> You mind if I sit here?<eos> I don't think there's anyone sitting at those tables.<eos> But she likes the sunny spot.<eos> Don'tcha?

Oh, that's nice!<eos> Thanks for thinking of me!<eos> I always knew that she hated me... but I always thought that you were my best friend!<eos> He's your only friend!<eos> Jodie!
He's your only friend!<eos> Jodie!<eos> No, I'll be fucked if I sit here and let you give us a guilt trip about this.<eos> Why don't you get off your lazy ass and go find some new fucking friends? !<eos> Jesus Christ!
We need to be thankful for everything we have.<eos> Caveman was happy with the roof over his head... a day's supply of food, and a family to share his burden.<eos> Honey, I'm home!<eos> What's for dinner?<eos> Well, two out of three.
She needs to have these pills every...<eos> Is this our new little friend?<eos> Who's this crazy kid, man?<eos> Who's this guy?<eos> Diego.
Nice to meet you.<eos> Wait, I thought it was just you.<eos> Diego lives here with me.<eos> He helps out a ton with the animals.<eos> Okay, yeah.
Fell in the shower.<eos> Sorry, to hear that.<eos> So...<eos> What do you do?<eos> What?
What do you do?<eos> What?<eos> I'm sorry, what?<eos> What's your line?<eos> Your job.
Something besides the problems with your goddamn garden.<eos> If you can hear me, just squeeze my hand.<eos> Just... come on, fucker!<eos> Dad?<eos> Something?
There it is.<eos> You have any kids of your own?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Do... you... have any niños of your own?<eos> Two.
It's me, Wilson.<eos> I wanted to see if you still lived here.<eos> Can I come in?<eos> You want some beet juice?<eos> Fuck, no!
I'm literally counting the seconds.<eos> Well, I just... I don't have any family left.<eos> And I've known you... since we were, what, nine years old? Ten?<eos> I don't have a single person who shares my same memories, you know?<eos> Lucky you.
Excuse me.<eos> I'm thinking to... try dating again a little bit, you know?<eos> Yeah, I gave up on women a long time ago.<eos> You bust your fucking ass... and what do you get?<eos> Empty fucking bank account?
It's my dad's car!<eos> Nice driving, asshole!<eos> Everybody's in a hurry.<eos> Hey, could you hand me that chicken?<eos> Oh, sure. Here.
Oh, I know. It is a total racket.<eos> They know that pet owners are all damaged and neurotic and we will... happily throw our money at the most nonsensical crap just to... buy a little affection.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, no shit.<eos> No shit.<eos> Oh, shit.
No shit.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> I am so, so, so sorry.<eos> My...
What the heck crawled up her ass?<eos> Yeah, no kidding.<eos> I'd be pretty stoked if some random guy tapped my car just to get into my pants.<eos> My, my, my, my, my, my, my My angel lover Oh, Christ, I haven't done this in a long time.<eos> Me, neither.
Looks aren't all that important to me.<eos> That's good.<eos> Wow, this place has got 1,748 reviews on Yelp.<eos> And what the hell does that even mean?<eos> Yelp.
Pippi.<eos> My ex?<eos> Pippi.<eos> Pippi what?<eos> Pippi Carmichael.
That's her sister.<eos> Well, she's all over here.<eos> She's got a big presence.<eos> Really?<eos> So...
Watch your door.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Excuse me, sir?<eos> Just a second. Watch the door.<eos> Quick question:
Bruises from the drug use and beatings.<eos> Frizzy coke hair.<eos> Waxy skin. You, of all people, know the drill.<eos> Her name's Pippi, but I'm sure she's got some... florid nom de guerre now like...<eos> "Klimaxx" or something.
Fuck off!<eos> Oh, we close at 9:00 tonight.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Oh, no, that's okay. I just wanted to ask... Do you have a Pippi working here?<eos> Like Pippi Longstocking?
Her sister says that she's fallen on hard times.<eos> You know, drugs, prostitution, who knows what else.<eos> I guess she's trying to get her shit back together, but...<eos> I blame her father.<eos> Rich Republican prick.
Two pinot noir, please!<eos> I don't get the Lynne thing.<eos> Why "Lynne"? I thought you hated "Lynne."<eos> Excuse me. Just let me get through.<eos> Wilson.
I don't get the Lynne thing.<eos> Why "Lynne"? I thought you hated "Lynne."<eos> Excuse me. Just let me get through.<eos> Wilson.<eos> Jesus Christ, man!
You're an amazing woman.<eos> What's this?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Pepper, down.<eos> Fuck!
What's this?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Pepper, down.<eos> Fuck!<eos> What?
Here we go.<eos> Fish and chips.<eos> Enjoy, guys.<eos> When are you done?<eos> Wilson.
Cool it, Wilson.<eos> Jesus.<eos> We made that.<eos> Hey, it's Claire.<eos> Hi, Claire.
I'm sorry, what did you say to me?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> What did you say to me, bitch?<eos> Hey, Claire, Jenny Craig's over here.<eos> Fat-ass bitch!
You need to shut the fuck up, you little prick!<eos> Watch yourself, asshole.<eos> No, you watch it!<eos> That's my daughter!<eos> Wilson, not now!
No, you watch it!<eos> That's my daughter!<eos> Wilson, not now!<eos> Bad timing!<eos> You little son of a bitch!
Get off me, asshole!<eos> Let go!<eos> No! I'm not letting go!<eos> Let it go!<eos> Wilson!
Look, it doesn't... Don't get bogged down in the details right now.<eos> We're just thrilled to finally have the opportunity to get to meet you!<eos> And if you're wondering about the lack of family resemblance... you couldn't tell it by looking at her, but she used to be a real hippo.<eos> Your grandpa wrote a well-regarded novel about Melville, and... Pippi's maternal grandfather was a famous judge in Ohio, and...<eos> Shit!
Of course, you turned out okay.<eos> In the long run.<eos> Oh, Pippi.<eos> Oh, Pippi!<eos> Hi, there.
Up your...? No.<eos> What the hell's wrong?<eos> Hey, come on, hop in.<eos> I'll give you a ride.<eos> No, thanks.
I'll give you a ride.<eos> No, thanks.<eos> I'll get the bus.<eos> No, no, I'll give you a ride.<eos> Claire!
It's a badge of honor.<eos> However... that does not mean that you have to sit back and get reamed for four years.<eos> So is there one particular asshole?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Monika the bitch.

No. No.<eos> I'm not doing that, Wilson.<eos> Come on, it'll be fun.<eos> I haven't been there since I was a kid.<eos> Wilson!
No fucking way. Of course I can't.<eos> Can you?<eos> She's a sweet kid with two crazy people stalking her.<eos> We're not stalking her.<eos> Wilson.
And you're expecting this huge emotional commitment... while you're dragging me along for this insane fucking insta-family?<eos> Pippi, it is that commitment... that is exactly what you need to help you move forward.<eos> Trust me, I know.<eos> You're an asshole!<eos> Goddamn it!
Trust me, I know.<eos> You're an asshole!<eos> Goddamn it!<eos> What is in there?<eos> Pippi?
You're an asshole!<eos> Goddamn it!<eos> What is in there?<eos> Pippi?<eos> Goddamn it!
What is in there?<eos> Pippi?<eos> Goddamn it!<eos> Calm yourself.<eos> Fuck!
Wow! So cool!<eos> You must have been here a million times, huh?<eos> Nope.<eos> My mom's scared of poor people.<eos> Perfect!
Yeah.<eos> How old?<eos> They're six and fifteen.<eos> Why?<eos> Oh, nothing.
Yeah.<eos> You know, that's...<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yeah. You're a wise man.<eos> Nice cock, by the way.
Yeah. You're a wise man.<eos> Nice cock, by the way.<eos> Pippi?<eos> They grow up so fast.<eos> Fuck you!
Don't you have your phone?<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> That's unbelievable.<eos> This thing has been right on time for like two weeks.<eos> Shit.
That's unbelievable.<eos> This thing has been right on time for like two weeks.<eos> Shit.<eos> Anyway, time is like, you know... Here and now is where we're at.<eos> Claire?
Hey, Dad.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Okay!<eos> Okay, bye.<eos> Bye! Bye!
Who, Claire?<eos> Did you see the way she was looking at you?<eos> Really?<eos> Magical.<eos> Oh, Christ.
Oh, Christ.<eos> Fucking Polly, man.<eos> Why can't she leave me alone?<eos> Delete.<eos> Bullshit.
Oh, honey!<eos> Hi.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hi, Will!
Hi.<eos> Hi, Will!<eos> Remember me?<eos> Of course.<eos> Wilson.
Thanks.<eos> Don't you think she looks...<eos> Thanks.<eos> What's the boy's name?<eos> Cooper.
You see?<eos> Now, that is pure Wilson.<eos> Here's to you, Claire.<eos> And to you, Coop!<eos> Coop!
Oh, well, I...<eos> Some of my best times with my mom were spent, um... not saying a word, just... just sitting together in the same room... feeling... the connection.<eos> Like a chemical thing.<eos> You know, I always used to try to imagine what you were like.<eos> My "real dad."
That says a lot to me.<eos> And I know that I've said some negative things about Wilson in the past, but...<eos> So, what are Claire's real parents like?<eos> Are they okay?<eos> Amazing.
And I know that I've said some negative things about Wilson in the past, but...<eos> So, what are Claire's real parents like?<eos> Are they okay?<eos> Amazing.<eos> Super rich.
But when you get to be my age, you kind of look at things in a different way.<eos> You're kind of living more in the moment.<eos> Things like this lake and the ducks...<eos> Shit like this becomes so damn huge.<eos> Fuck you!
Stop it!<eos> Pippi! I'm getting fucking tired of this bullshit!<eos> No, Pippi!<eos> Oh, oh, oh! Look.<eos> A little woodland creature.
Big drinkers, though.<eos> Big, huge drinkers.<eos> There he is!<eos> - Come here.<eos> - What?
- Get over here.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> Guys? No, I didn't do anything!<eos> Wilson... I lost it.<eos> - Pippi?
- Pippi?<eos> - Come on, let's go.<eos> Pippi, what's going on?<eos> Just don't say anything.<eos> Polly!
Polly!<eos> It's called kidnapping!<eos> Sit down.<eos> Pippi?<eos> Claire?
"Fuck you."<eos> What'd you say, bitch?<eos> No, I'm not... I like it.<eos> It's like an acknowledgement to a whole other generation...<eos> Hi.
Fuck, yeah!<eos> Wassup, bro? Hey.<eos> How you doing, man?<eos> You staying out of trouble?<eos> Yo, Wilson!
Wassup, bro? Hey.<eos> How you doing, man?<eos> You staying out of trouble?<eos> Yo, Wilson!<eos> Wassup, man?
Hey, don't eat the chocolate cake.<eos> Gave me the shits earlier.<eos> There's more pieces than there is puzzle left.<eos> These are that color and there ain't no blanks in that color.<eos> Hey, Wilson!
What the fuck are you looking at?<eos> Thank you.<eos> So... What's been going on in the world?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Nothing.
"Cyndi's Cupcakery?"<eos> What happened to the used bookstore?<eos> Is that you, Diana?<eos> It's me, Wilson.<eos> Pepper's dad!
What happened to the used bookstore?<eos> Is that you, Diana?<eos> It's me, Wilson.<eos> Pepper's dad!<eos> Hi.
You can't believe what happened to me, Shelly.<eos> Where's all your dog stuff?<eos> Well, I'm not sitting anymore.<eos> So where is she?<eos> Pepper?
You and all your brothers and sisters in the animal family.<eos> We vow to honor and protect your kind and oppose with all our heart those... who would harm or degrade any living creature in any way.<eos> Amen.<eos> So whatever happened with you and Francisco?<eos> Diego?
Well, you know, I wish I'd have started this years ago.<eos> I spent so much time pining after my ex and moping like an idiot.<eos> I'm ready for... a real relationship.<eos> Someone with a... kind heart and an open demeanor and a gentle spirit...<eos> Motherfucker!
I want to hear this.<eos> I just need to finish this email.<eos> I mean, I feel like I'm fading into oblivion while... everyone else is scampering to keep up.<eos> Fifty years from now, there won't even be the slightest trace of my existence.<eos> Nothing.
Look, he has no interest in talking to you, and we'd... just prefer if you don't call this number anymore, okay?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Who the hell was that?<eos> Wow.<eos> Hi.
I guess I wanted to know if he was gonna have any weird diseases or something.<eos> But I mean, you're just a kid yourself.<eos> Don't start with that.<eos> I get enough of that shit from everybody else.<eos> I just... A baby?
But I mean, you're just a kid yourself.<eos> Don't start with that.<eos> I get enough of that shit from everybody else.<eos> I just... A baby?<eos> A baby.
Wilson, she needs to go.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> She has to leave.<eos> Wilson, she needs to leave.<eos> Wilson!
Thanks for taking care of my baby.<eos> You... did an amazing job.<eos> Yes.<eos> Um, you know, actually it's okay.<eos> Yeah, false alarm.
No, I'm sorry.<eos> Thanks very much.<eos> What are you still doing here?<eos> My mom said you were beating off.<eos> No, I...
Please?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Please, Claire?<eos> I wouldn't be in your way.<eos> Claire?
I did say that.<eos> Before this, I was screwed.<eos> And when it was all said and done, figured I'd just die and be forgotten.<eos> A handful of ashes dumped in the ocean.<eos> Hi.

I have a ship.<eos> Black Pearl has never left me side.<eos> The pirate Barbossa rules these seas now.<eos> Has 10 ships.<eos> Guns full.
I will not let him down.<eos> Soon, there will be a Bloodmoon.<eos> Only then can the map be read and the Trident found.<eos> - Who are you?<eos> Carina Smyth!

I believe I nodded off, there. One more thing.<eos> A message from someone you know, named Captain Salazar.<eos> I once knew a Spaniard named something in Spanish.<eos> El Matador Del Mar, The Butcher of the Sea.<eos> Him?

And all your treasure will come back to you.<eos> Time to make a deal with the dead.<eos> Come on, pirate.<eos> Hold on, stop.<eos> - Uncle Jack!
Can't complain, really. You?<eos> I've been waiting all morning in here, for a beating.<eos> - But the service is terrible.<eos> - Shameful.<eos> Jack.
- Good point.<eos> Did I ever tell you the one about the skeleton?<eos> Yes you have, many times.<eos> Skeleton goes into a bar, orders a beer and a mop.<eos> Funny as ever.
Thank you.<eos> And mention my name, they won't cut your feet off.<eos> Come on, you're first!<eos> How would you like to die, pirate?<eos> Hanging, firing squad or a new invention,
And mention my name, they won't cut your feet off.<eos> Come on, you're first!<eos> How would you like to die, pirate?<eos> Hanging, firing squad or a new invention,<eos> - the guillotine.

My head's about to be lopped off, hence the urgency.<eos> And my neck is to be broken.<eos> Did you know that on occasion, the neck doesn't actually break.<eos> - It just hurts.<eos> - What?
You're holding everything but my word.<eos> Then I bestow upon you the honor of saving me, for a small donation.<eos> You expect us to pay you, to save you? Yes!<eos> For a mere 10 pieces.<eos> Madness!
- Two for the price of one.<eos> - Please don't let go of me.<eos> Might be difficult once he kills me.<eos> Gentlemen, these two prisoners will lead us to the Trident.<eos> - Captain. - Hm?
If he's lucky, he'll drown before the barnacles shred him to ribbons.<eos> - Barnacles?<eos> - Like a thousand knives across your back.<eos> 'Course, the blood attracts sharks.<eos> - Sharks?
Let him up, I'll find it tonight.<eos> Sorry, can't bring him up.<eos> Look for yourself.<eos> As I said: blushing!<eos> Filthy pirate!
By the way that little sliver of knowledge, cost you five pieces.<eos> - I'm not paying you for that!<eos> - Never say that to a woman.<eos> Just because you can't see something doesn't mean it's not there.<eos> Like the map?
I know what it's like to be bested by Jack Sparrow.<eos> - He's an enemy to us both.<eos> - You don't know who I am.<eos> I've heard stories of a mighty Spanish captain.<eos> El Matador Del Mar.
No-no-no.<eos> Men, no.<eos> No!<eos> Pirates!<eos> Pirates.
Hang on boys!<eos> The sea was finally pure.<eos> Their wretched flags would no longer stain the sea.<eos> They are begging for mercy.<eos> Mercy?
The sea was finally pure.<eos> Their wretched flags would no longer stain the sea.<eos> They are begging for mercy.<eos> Mercy?<eos> Mercy?
The way I see it, it's just the two of us left.<eos> You surrender to me now, and I'll let you live. Simple.<eos> He stood there, looking like a little bird.<eos> And from that day he earned himself a name that would haunt me for the rest of my days:<eos> Jack the Sparrow.
And from that day he earned himself a name that would haunt me for the rest of my days:<eos> Jack the Sparrow.<eos> Right then, you surrender to me now and I'll let you live.<eos> I shall let you live.<eos> This boy...
Follow him in!<eos> To the gallows!<eos> Grab some lines!<eos> Prepare the bootleg!<eos> Port side.
And she was always looking at her watch.<eos> I can vouch for that.<eos> - So, no one can find the X, but you, right?<eos> - No.<eos> - And the donkey?
- So, no one can find the X, but you, right?<eos> - No.<eos> - And the donkey?<eos> - Ship to the aft!<eos> Salazar.
Kill them all.<eos> Kill me and, and I'll be dead.<eos> And then the other dead won't be able to have their revenge.<eos> - Against me... Being dead.<eos> - What?
That's right.<eos> Are all pirates this stupid?<eos> What are we going to do?<eos> As Captain, might I suggest...<eos> Mutiny? !
Carina, the dead are coming.<eos> Well, I choose not to believe in supernatural nonsense.<eos> Do you not see what's behind us?<eos> - Drop them!<eos> - Si.
I'm going with her.<eos> You would leave me for some horologist in her knickers?<eos> Yes.<eos> You men are all alike.<eos> Shark.
You would leave me for some horologist in her knickers?<eos> Yes.<eos> You men are all alike.<eos> Shark.<eos> Henry!
- How do they do that?<eos> - We have to swim for it.<eos> I'll distract them.<eos> Now!<eos> Shoo!

I'll distract them.<eos> Now!<eos> Shoo!<eos> Henry!<eos> Hey, Jack Sparrow.
Shoo!<eos> Henry!<eos> Hey, Jack Sparrow.<eos> Jack 'Esparrow'.<eos> Spanish?
Ohh...<eos> They're unable to step on land.<eos> I knew that, though.<eos> Ghosts!<eos> Carina!
Ghosts!<eos> Carina!<eos> You will soon pay for what you did to me. No-no-no.<eos> There's no need to bother, really.<eos> Carina!
Carina!<eos> I have no time to chat, because me map just ran away.<eos> I will be waiting for you.<eos> Why would he be waiting for me? Why would he be waiting for me?<eos> Pirates!
I have no time to chat, because me map just ran away.<eos> I will be waiting for you.<eos> Why would he be waiting for me? Why would he be waiting for me?<eos> Pirates!<eos> - Scrum.
So be a good lad and take the wheel.<eos> And you, take the captain's hat.<eos> Oh, it's the proudest moment of my l...<eos> We will beat your captain to death, until he reveals where they're heading.<eos> - Carina!
Oh, no!<eos> Help!<eos> - Help me!<eos> Help!<eos> - Carina!
- Henry, help me.<eos> - Help her!<eos> By rule of the King, I sentence you all to death.<eos> I think we should tell each other where our treasures are buried, just in case one of us survives.<eos> Oh, good idea.
- You promised me Jack's blood.<eos> - But Jack be trapped!<eos> - He can never escape that island.<eos> - HE'S ON LAND!<eos> Hello.
Hello.<eos> I upheld our deal.<eos> Me men and meself will go ashore.<eos> The scurvy traitor will be yours, on me honor.<eos> Honor?
Me men and meself will go ashore.<eos> The scurvy traitor will be yours, on me honor.<eos> Honor?<eos> !<eos> What honor, hombre? What honor?

Now, Pig, how could I honestly make an honest woman out of it?<eos> That.<eos> Her.<eos> - What are those things?<eos> - Our children.
Surely, this is not legal.<eos> This is not legal.<eos> He's right.<eos> Does any man here object to these nuptials? - I do.<eos> - Congratulations.
He's right.<eos> Does any man here object to these nuptials? - I do.<eos> - Congratulations.<eos> You may kiss the bride.<eos> Y-y-you...
You may kiss the bride.<eos> Y-y-you...<eos> You like seafood, do you?<eos> Jack, we meet again!<eos> Hector!
She needs the sea!<eos> She was a fine ship.<eos> Let's...<eos> There be room for only one captain.<eos> - Oo, filthy beast.
So you be saying, that, that star is pretending to be a map?<eos> Sir, there is no island on any map to support what the woman says.<eos> Captain, you don't have to understand her.<eos> Just believe her.<eos> Anyone?
Release them!<eos> Sir, you wouldn't allow a woman to steer your ship?<eos> !<eos> She will follow her star, or we'll all die together.<eos> The Black Pearl!
- That would be Carina.<eos> - So, you do know your stars?<eos> - I'm a captain...<eos> I know which stars to follow home.<eos> Smyth?
- Shut your trap!<eos> - What was her name?<eos> It's right on the tip of me tongue.<eos> - Do you wanna lose that tongue?<eos> - Margaret Smyth!
I'd say this puts me in a rather favorable position, Daddy.<eos> - Tell me what you want. - I want me compass.<eos> 216 barrels of rum.<eos> - You want Jack?<eos> - Dinner!
It's here, somewhere.<eos> Have you found what you're looking for yet, miss?<eos> I'm trying!<eos> The stars will soon be gone.<eos> Carina!
The stars will soon be gone.<eos> Carina!<eos> Henry, look, the island is there!<eos> You found it!<eos> The island.
You found it!<eos> The island.<eos> Land!<eos> Get to the Mary!<eos> Carina!
The island.<eos> Land!<eos> Get to the Mary!<eos> Carina!<eos> Carina!
Land!<eos> Get to the Mary!<eos> Carina!<eos> Carina!<eos> Henry!
It has to be here.<eos> Look at it Jack.<eos> It's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.<eos> This is what my father wanted me to find.<eos> - Rocks?
Look at it Jack.<eos> It's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.<eos> This is what my father wanted me to find.<eos> - Rocks?<eos> - No, not rocks, stars.
You will be trapped in his body, forever.<eos> The Trident will set me free.<eos> - Time to kill a sparrow.<eos> - Look Jack, there it is.<eos> - The Trident!
The Trident will set me free.<eos> - Time to kill a sparrow.<eos> - Look Jack, there it is.<eos> - The Trident!<eos> Jack!

Oh, piss off!<eos> Henry wake up, he's killing Jack!<eos> Henry!<eos> - Power of the sea.<eos> - What?
This is where the tale ends!<eos> No!<eos> Die!<eos> Divide.<eos> Henry!
Henry!<eos> Divide.<eos> Break.<eos> Break the Trident and you'll break every curse of the sea.<eos> Adios, Sparrow.
All curses have broken.<eos> Yeah!<eos> We're flesh and blood!<eos> - The Pearl!<eos> My Pearl!
- The Pearl!<eos> My Pearl!<eos> Move, fast!<eos> Hold it steady boys, don't let it slip.<eos> Jack!
Treasure.<eos> Hold on!<eos> Hector!<eos> Go to starboard!<eos> Pirate's life, Hector...
I don't know.<eos> For a moment I had everything, Henry.<eos> Now, it's all gone, again.<eos> It's not all gone, Miss Smyth.<eos> Barbossa.
You're not still cursed.<eos> - It's me.<eos> - Then I was...<eos> - Wrong!<eos> - Slightly in error.
- It's me.<eos> - Then I was...<eos> - Wrong!<eos> - Slightly in error.<eos> Although, one...

Indeed!<eos> Welcome back, Captain.<eos> I thank you very much.<eos> Coming through.<eos> - Captain!
- Cheers, thank you. - Oh good!<eos> - Master Gibbs.<eos> - The ship is yours Captain.<eos> I thank you!<eos> Monkey.
That is what enabled him to pull off the biggest Ponzi scheme on record. $65 billion.<eos> Bernard L. Madoff... inmate number 61727054.<eos> In overseas trading today, the Nikkei was down over 8% with Australia's benchmark not far behind.<eos> The crisis shows no sign of ending as DOW futures are down this morning on Wall Street and Main Street continues to find itself<eos> - Shit. Since the Great Depression.
It's important that people can take care of their families.<eos> Isn't it better to play it safe? Hang on to any windfall just in case?<eos> I'm paying out the bonuses now. Mark:<eos> But that's crazy. It doesn't make any sense.<eos> - Peter.
- I ma...<eos> I made them up. - I've seen the trades.<eos> They're fake.<eos> It's all fake.<eos> Basically, just a big Ponzi scheme.
There's supposed to be 50 billion. There's absolutely nothing. It's all gone.<eos> I spoke to Peter. I told him I'm gonna turn myself in next week.<eos> How could you do this?<eos> - I just couldn't stop... - Mark:<eos> Bullshit.
How could you do this?<eos> - I just couldn't stop... - Mark:<eos> Bullshit.<eos> It got bigger and bigger and it just wouldn't stop.<eos> Bullshit.
Everyone in the industry, including the highest-ranking officials at the SEC, believed that my brother was one of the most honorable and successful traders of our time.<eos> Nobody believed that more than I did.<eos> I revered him.<eos> I trusted him implicitly.<eos> - Sorkin.
- Yes. - And you never asked what went on the 17th floor?<eos> Of course I did.<eos> - You did? - Yes.<eos> - But...<eos> - But what?
Who was on the phone?<eos> Man:<eos> Agent: What did Bernie Madoff say to you?<eos> Yeah? Man: Frank, my brother, is in the office...<eos> What the fuck?
- Hi, Mom.<eos> - Hi, Mark. - Honey, I'm, um...<eos> I'm with your father and in order to release him on bond they need four signatures.<eos> It's a $10 million bond.<eos> - What?
Anyway, can you get down here? Uh, I'll text you the address.<eos> Mom, do you understand what he's done?<eos> No, honey, Mark, I know you're angry, but he's your father.<eos> I'm not doing it.<eos> End of discussion.
Mom, do you understand what he's done?<eos> No, honey, Mark, I know you're angry, but he's your father.<eos> I'm not doing it.<eos> End of discussion.<eos> Ruth: Mark.
For how long?<eos> - I don't know, Ruth.<eos> - For a long time or a little?<eos> I don't know.<eos> - What?
You remember that actress Goldie Hawn?<eos> - Diana: I do very well.<eos> - Yeah, that was Ruth.<eos> She'd wake up every morning without a care in the world.<eos> Very lively, very bubbly.
No. I never thought of the word fraudulent.<eos> In my experience, and I mean this, there's only four different types of pussy.<eos> I'm dead serious.<eos> You got your... let me show you. I just saw one.<eos> All right, right there.
I just saw one. There. Now, don't make it obvious.<eos> Right there. That is your Lincoln Continental pussy.<eos> Beautiful. Just... it's just right.<eos> You know what I mean? Like Goldilocks just right. It's not too fancy, it's not too plain.<eos> It just...
You built, as you described, a lavish home in Bridgewater, New Jersey, correct?<eos> - Well, define "lavish." - Sure.<eos> - Uh, how many bedrooms did it have?<eos> - Five. - How many bathrooms?<eos> - Seven.
If something were to happen to me, he'd fill you guys in on all the details you need to know.<eos> Andy: And what if Frank decides to screw you?<eos> I mean, I don't even know how much you're worth. Is it a billion?<eos> Two billion?<eos> Three?
Calm down, calm down.<eos> Everything is written down in a safe deposit box.<eos> If something were to happen to me, you consult with our lawyers, and they'll handle it.<eos> They'll fill you in on everything.<eos> Everything, huh?
- No, you don't understand! You don't have to fucking understand!<eos> You're asking me about taking over the advisory and yet you can't even follow a simple fucking instruction to shut the fuck up!<eos> You don't understand.<eos> You don't understand. Leave it alone.<eos> Okay.
You don't understand.<eos> You don't understand. Leave it alone.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - Good night.
- So they're accomplices in some way, too.<eos> - Bernie. Accomplices because they trusted you?<eos> Accomplices because you were so trustworthy, you seemed so trustworthy.<eos> Yeah, but there's a lack of honesty on their behalf, an unwillingness to take responsibility for their behavior.<eos> - Your investors?
- Who are you protecting? ! Officer:<eos> And you need to back up right now.<eos> - We're talking about my fucking life savings! - I told you right now! - Do you understand?<eos> - You need to back up right now, sir.<eos> - Eleanor: Hello, Madoff.
- Catherine, it's gonna be fine.<eos> - No, they're gonna be looking in with their long lenses and we'll be trapped.<eos> They're gonna get bored just standing around.<eos> I'm not the story. We've gotta get curtains right now.<eos> Shit.
What about a house call?<eos> I can pay extra.<eos> - I'm sorry...<eos> - Pierre.<eos> - Shit.
I haven't figured that part out yet. Something nice. Maybe Ambien.<eos> How much Ambien do we have?<eos> Enough to open a fucking pharmacy.<eos> What about these?<eos> Klonopin? Same thing.
- Let's not get started, Ruth.<eos> We had a good life, didn't we?<eos> Yeah, until you ruined it.<eos> ♪ Have yourself... ♪ Boy: Pop-pop!<eos> - ♪ Faithful friends... ♪
Bernie: It's gonna be okay.<eos> You can take all of Erwin's other accounts... his savings, life insurance, everything... and you can put it all in his account here.<eos> God bless you, Bernie.<eos> Boy:<eos> - Pop-pop! - Daniel!

Man: Mr. Markopolos, it's all yours.<eos> Markopolos:<eos> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My team and I tried our best to get the SEC to investigate and shut down the Madoff Ponzi scheme with repeated and credible warnings to the SEC that started in May 2000.<eos> - We knew that...<eos> - Ruth.
- We're gonna need your account number just so we can verify the assets.<eos> Oh, Bern, you're fucking killing me.<eos> 646.<eos> Great, thank you. Do you mind if you take that jacket off before you go out there?<eos> - Oh, um...
The joke on the street is that Bernie's like the Jewish T-bill. - Very funny. I'm on the phone.<eos> I'm on the phone. - He's that safe. I'm on the phone.<eos> I'll introduce you guys later. He's gonna love you.<eos> See if you can rattle Fairfield's cage. In the meantime, I've got a few ideas.<eos> - Fairfield? - Yeah.

I haven't made many withdrawals. Although, that's probably something we should discuss, hmm?<eos> I did wanna tell you that there are some real opportunities in the market right now if you're interested, Jeffry.<eos> - Hmm. - What do you think?<eos> - We should be talking...<eos> - Mrs. Madoff! - Mr. Picower.
If you don't stop these withdrawals and replace the money before the end of the month, then I'm gonna cut you off! I'm gonna close the whole fucking Fairfield account!<eos> Yes!<eos> don't lie. - Oh, I did not! - You're such a liar.<eos> - You're a liar. Sweetheart, is that a little bit too rare?<eos> Girl:
- That's not what I'm saying. - That's exactly what you're saying.<eos> I'm not saying that.<eos> They are taken care of. I have other arrangements with them.<eos> Something is not kosher here.<eos> - Something.

Your request for a stay is denied.<eos> Mr. Madoff, I will see you at sentencing.<eos> If you are visiting an inmate in the maximum security wing, form a single-file line to your right.<eos> Stop here.<eos> Keys.
Yeah, I get a lot of questions.<eos> Yeah, especially about you, you and Mark. "So the sons knew, right?<eos> They were in on it. They had to be, right?" Reed, when I found out, it was like my head exploded.<eos> - I just... - Shh, you hear that?<eos> - What?

You know this wasn't really what I had in mind when you said projects.<eos> Scrub.<eos> You don't have a vacuum cleaner?<eos> No.<eos> - Bill.
Yeah.<eos> You're awfully quiet, Gavin.<eos> I just had an idea for a short story.<eos> See, there's a method to my madness.<eos> Right.

The Botox.<eos> No, Frank, it's just a shave, but I appreciate the thought.<eos> - Hey, no problem.<eos> - Nice to meet you.<eos> - Quite a colorful character.
Thank you.<eos> Can I get you something to drink?<eos> Would you like a glass of wine?<eos> - Sure, that sounds lovely.<eos> - White or red?
And I can see that you're fragile.<eos> I wanna see the way that you see.<eos> How you see me.<eos> I can see that you're fragile too.<eos> Suzanne?

You alright, Bill?<eos> You remember this?<eos> I had never been as happy in my life as I was in that moment.<eos> You love him?<eos> - Mark.
Just end this thing with him.<eos> Oh, I don't know if I forgive you.<eos> I've made mistakes.<eos> Everyone makes mistakes.<eos> Even you.
But we can change.<eos> I've changed.<eos> You know what I thought of when I was in prison?<eos> You know what got me through?<eos> You.
I am sorry, Bill.<eos> I have to... I have to go.<eos> Suzanne good to see you.<eos> Nice to have you around.<eos> - Frank!

- Are we really gonna go through this again?<eos> Deanna will love that.<eos> All I ever wanted was for you to be happy.<eos> - Hello, Bill.<eos> - Bonjour, Jean.
I know Mordred. He would accept surrender.<eos> Hold the crown.<eos> And hold it steady.<eos> Drink their blood!<eos> War!
Loose!<eos> There will be no more killings.<eos> There will be no more purges. Am I clear, brother?<eos> Now leave me.<eos> Peace?
Step aside for the king.<eos> Get them back to work.<eos> Sire.<eos> Sergeant! Get them under manners!<eos> Still so handsome, my king.
We're searching all houses.<eos> Whoa. Slow down, new boy, before you trip up.<eos> What did you say?<eos> I'm gonna take your hands for that.<eos> Sergeant!
He touched me, sir.<eos> Well, you should count yourself lucky.<eos> Most people have to pay for that.<eos> Now take your terriers and get out!<eos> Jack's Eye.
In the back room, now.<eos> What's this all about, Jack? What's it got to do with us?<eos> Do you have any idea who that man is?<eos> For a man who's so popular, I'm surprised I don't.<eos> Goosefat Bill.

Well, when you see the king, why don't you ask him? Hurry up! Move along!<eos> What was that?<eos> God save the king.<eos> Bollocks. Excuse me, mate.<eos> Oi.
Leave it.<eos> Excuse me. Behind you, pal.<eos> Here, mind your back.<eos> Oi, pal, there's a line here.<eos> John.
Hands on the hilt, stupid.<eos> Oi, both hands.<eos> I said, both hands.<eos> Right, ten digits round the blunt bit.<eos> Left foot, right foot.
I will show them power.<eos> I will show them strength and dignity.<eos> You will show them lies, weakness, and shame.<eos> Hail, King Vortigern!<eos> King Vortigern!
What about the rest of the team?<eos> Most of the girls are with us, but the rest of the crew pretty much got gist of your popularity and made themselves scarce.<eos> Blue, go get us something to drink.<eos> Come on, boss. I'm one of the crew.<eos> Blue!
Come on, ideas.<eos> Burn his favorite palace down.<eos> How you gonna do that, then?<eos> I know the man that supplies brandy to the palace. Shipment first of the month.<eos> All right, Dan. Wine or brandy?

You will face it when it's worth it to you.<eos> Don't get me wrong, I look away.<eos> We all look away.<eos> But that is the difference between a man and a king.<eos> Maggie!
How do you feel about a rooftop king assassination?<eos> - My roof? - Yeah.<eos> And least of all the king's assassins that he'll have to hang for.<eos> - I'd hang?<eos> - Probably.
Why don't you use the other building? The one back here?<eos> Because it's 175 yards away.<eos> And how far can you shoot, Back Lack?<eos> Accurately?<eos> Bill?
Well, we can't see them. And they can't see us.<eos> Maybe they thought that was luck.<eos> That could've killed us.<eos> They scream like girls, your friends.<eos> Bill?
This way, this way. Let's go! Move!<eos> Move! - Move! - Move!<eos> Get out of the way! Left!<eos> Go left! Over here!<eos> Hey. Here. In here.
They trained their whole lives for this.<eos> - Go on. - Let go.<eos> Come on!<eos> Move! - Fight!<eos> - Second rank!
Some of us won't. Well, better some than none!<eos> You go first.<eos> Mike! Get down the hole.<eos> Mike, get down the hole. Don't like rats, boss.<eos> Dell.
Where's my dad?<eos> We got split up, but he knows his way.<eos> - I've gotta find him.<eos> Your dad knows what he's doing. He'll be back before you know it, mate.<eos> Wet Stick.

I'll be all right, mate. Just give me a minute.<eos> Come on, Blue.<eos> You carry this.<eos> Come on. Come on. Come on, Blue.<eos> Evenin'.
Who's he to you?<eos> Never seen him before. I usually come in later, you know, do the dishes when they're all gone.<eos> Is that the truth?<eos> Yes, sir. I'd never lie to a Blackleg.<eos> Good boy.
Let him go. Let him go.<eos> Take the boy and... No!<eos> No!<eos> Crush the Resistance tonight!<eos> Archers!
All right.<eos> Now, when you say we're going to take the castle, what does that mean?<eos> I thought you said you weren't gonna push me.<eos> Come on, lads. Chop, chop.<eos> Blue! Blue! - Blue!
What's going on?<eos> Father, you're scaring me.<eos> I love you very much.<eos> Come on!<eos> Charge!
It would be my honor.<eos> Well, now that's out the way, let's eat.<eos> Why have enemies, when you can have friends?<eos> Arise, my king.<eos> King Arthur.
What's your name? ♪ Oh, I've been changed ♪<eos> Let's go from the top again, just 'cause I want your tongue to be three times the size it should be.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> His hands were in everything.<eos> The money, the fame.
Oh, yeah!<eos> That's old.<eos> That's been there.<eos> Oh, I was there this summer.<eos> What about a job?
Whatever you're doing.<eos> I know.<eos> Who am I?<eos> I show apartments.<eos> A dog walker.
Who am I?<eos> I show apartments.<eos> A dog walker.<eos> I thought we could just roll and tumble.<eos> Live from song to song.
How long you lived here?<eos> About two weeks.<eos> I don't like it.<eos> It's all for sale.<eos> All of it... honors, titles.
It's all for sale.<eos> All of it... honors, titles.<eos> This, none of this exists.<eos> What do you see?<eos> Pool?
It's all just free fall.<eos> You have too much pride.<eos> I thought pride was a good thing.<eos> People aren't proud enough.<eos> Selfish!
You have too much pride.<eos> I thought pride was a good thing.<eos> People aren't proud enough.<eos> Selfish!<eos> Arrogant!
And they want you to! They want you to!<eos> So that he could reach the unknown.<eos> He experimented.<eos> They scare you with names.<eos> Like wickedness.
Every hold.<eos> To have life at any price.<eos> Not to settle.<eos> To go up...<eos> Higher.-... free.
Let's us decide what's right now.<eos> - What do you think of this world? - It's its own.<eos> - There's no possessions, right?<eos> You know I felt terrible about that.<eos> Beer...
That was the first time in my life that I knew.<eos> Everything came from that hour.<eos> I wish that it could last forever.<eos> They have a beauty in their life... that makes me ugly.<eos> A joy.
Yes.<eos> I was shy.<eos> This concert.<eos> Who's on first?<eos> This concert!
You don't like to say it.<eos> I love you.<eos> I'm so scared sometimes.<eos> We're wanderers, you and I.<eos> Like birds.
Well, just look at the facts.<eos> Take it out of your hands.<eos> Why do you think it can't work as a country song?<eos> - It can.<eos> - Maybe you... As a... as a country...
Yeah, what is it, morals...<eos> Taking credit for someone else's work.<eos> I told you about that shit.<eos> 50-50. Equals.<eos> Brothers.
Are you gonna miss me?<eos> Do you want me to stay?<eos> I can't ask you that.<eos> Well, then I gotta go.<eos> Foolish me.
Do you want me to stay?<eos> I can't ask you that.<eos> Well, then I gotta go.<eos> Foolish me.<eos> Devil.
I don't deserve you.<eos> The shame of it.<eos> Things changed.<eos> You became suspicious.<eos> Stupid girl.
We would express that generosity not just in this moment or on this campus, but as we have opportunity every day throughout our community and our city, around our state, even across our borders.<eos> And we will be known as a generous people.<eos> And we bless even as we have been blessed.<eos> For we ask this in Your Son's name.<eos> Amen.
So I decided to move here.<eos> I don't know if I would move here from Paris.<eos> I wanted to experience it.<eos> Just let me know when I can come over and take him out or...<eos> - Anything.
- Tomorrow... if fine?<eos> - Where are you from?<eos> - From here.<eos> Yeah, it's like the, um... the skin, I like this idea of, um... you know, losing your... your-your skin.<eos> - And, like, the phoenix. - Yeah.
I guess not.<eos> - Is this a joke?<eos> - She's kidding, ma.<eos> - Oh. - Oh, it was a joke.<eos> Not very funny.
- Is this a joke?<eos> - She's kidding, ma.<eos> - Oh. - Oh, it was a joke.<eos> Not very funny.<eos> Cheers.
I used to think I could never be wicked.<eos> Wicked before. A long way out for me. So much to seek to be consoled as to understand, to be loved as to love.<eos> For it is in giving that we receive.<eos> It is in pardoning...<eos> - Bang.

It's a love story.<eos> Excuse... excuse me.<eos> Is this happening?<eos> Who was that girl I saw you with at the hotel?<eos> Just a girl.
Excuse... excuse me.<eos> Is this happening?<eos> Who was that girl I saw you with at the hotel?<eos> Just a girl.<eos> A woman.
I went out with her, and I never called her again.<eos> Did you love her?<eos> I didn't realize it at the time.<eos> Don't smile.<eos> - You ready?
Every doubt.<eos> You found me.<eos> You held out your hand.<eos> I took sex.<eos> A gift.
Is that your fella?<eos> Fight for him.<eos> If you really love him... don't let him get away.<eos> "For Mercy has a human heart;<eos> Pity, a human face;
Prays to the human form... Love, Mercy, Pity, Peace.<eos> And all must love the human form, in heathen, Turk, or Jew..."<eos> - Want him on your shoulder? - Mm-hmm.<eos> It was like a new paradise.<eos> Forgiveness.
Mom's gone crazy.<eos> Brother's up to no good.<eos> I won't stop loving you.<eos> I don't think I can.<eos> BV...
BV...<eos> It's complicated.<eos> There you are.<eos> I gotta go back and start over.<eos> Like a kid.
You wanna go back to a simple life.<eos> I want the same.<eos> Let nothing come between us.<eos> Ever.<eos> This.

Ruby.<eos> You missed our appointment this morning.<eos> I cannot approve your return to the workplace till we talk.<eos> Guys at the department are concerned about your recent behavior.<eos> The guys at the department?
I thought I was walking into a controlled situation.<eos> Instead, I found myself in the middle of a meth lab with a pissed off junkie.<eos> He assaulted you?<eos> He kicked my ass.<eos> Okay?

So can I go do my job, or do you want to keep talking bullshit?<eos> I'm on my way.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I feel so much better now.<eos> Jennifer...
Me and Cass.<eos> No, no. I'm giving it to Emerson and Flannigan.<eos> You want Cagney and Lacey to take it or you wanna get it solved?<eos> All right, hotshot, it's yours.<eos> Yeah.
I'm looking for everything.<eos> It's police-issued, and there's more of them.<eos> Looks like the same gun killed the big guy.<eos> Vincent Downs, Homicide.<eos> Jennifer Bryant.

Arrest records going back 12 years.<eos> What happened to your face?<eos> Why don't you take a closer look?<eos> It's just everybody's been talking about your situation.<eos> Talk of the town.
Me and my partner got the call.<eos> You did?<eos> Anyway, I was just looking out for a fellow officer.<eos> You should put some ice on that. Yeah.<eos> Yeah.
I don't care how many times he shows up.<eos> He ain't his father. I'm his father.<eos> I know you are.<eos> You gotta respect that, D.<eos> Yeah.
So what am I supposed to do?<eos> What, he's just supposed to...<eos> You're supposed to come in and take care of your family? That?<eos> Okay, D.<eos> All right. All right.
Thank you for the flowers.<eos> Oh, it's the least we could do.<eos> Hey, this is Bryant.<eos> I need a file on an officer.<eos> Vincent Downs.
Get the bag.<eos> I can't believe you thought I'd do some shit like that, man.<eos> I hit you when I'm on the way back.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Rob.
You only think with your dick.<eos> It's always this fat girl and that fat girl.<eos> And that's why you turned out so stupid.<eos> 'Cause your daddy married your mom and fucked her.<eos> Sweet lady.

Delicious.<eos> But my father, he's...<eos> He's a big thinker.<eos> We got a new pie getting baked up.<eos> Canada.
But me, I step up and I promise my father that our Canadian pie is safe, and that I could cover the shortage with an extra<eos> 25 kilos.<eos> Your 25 kilos.<eos> I was just trying to help.<eos> No, Stanley.

Yes. I lost him.<eos> God damn it.<eos> We got his kid.<eos> He's gonna bring us our drugs.<eos> Stan...
Hey, I thought you said you'd meet me outside.<eos> I knew he was dirty.<eos> Where is he?<eos> I stayed with the evidence.<eos> Jesus Christ.
No.<eos> If we hang around waiting for paperwork, we're gonna miss it.<eos> This is big.<eos> We can bring down the Novaks and have an internal bust at the same time.<eos> Jennifer...

You all right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's over.<eos> Let's get out of here.<eos> Hey, Rob.

Needs a new coat of paint.<eos> And there's some tiles on your roof that need fixing.<eos> You'll never have time to do all that in three days, Jack.<eos> I said it might take a little bit longer, didn't I?<eos> Right.
- Can't get any worse than that, I guess.<eos> - Oh, yes, it can.<eos> The worst part is that they did make the movie and the only thing left of my book was the title.<eos> I married the woman of my dreams, I had money an apartment in the Wilshire Corridor, you know, tons of needy friends and it all went away.<eos> Even the woman.
I'm not a recluse.<eos> Must be it.<eos> You know I'd really like to read one of your scripts.<eos> If that wouldn't be a problem.<eos> Okay.
Nobody wants it.<eos> My agent says it's crap.<eos> Under the Clock.<eos> - I think I've heard this title before.<eos> - Even the title, then.
Yeah, yes, enjoy it, man.<eos> Good afternoon.<eos> How was your nap?<eos> Not good. Not good.<eos> Delias Kristianiae.
Go on.<eos> You're the writer, man.<eos> You write it.<eos> But you gotta be committed.<eos> Okay, sure, yeah.
You can't read this.<eos> It's called a work in progress, you know?<eos> That's not the problem.<eos> This story the way it happens, it's too easy.<eos> Too easy?
Maybe they worked it out in advance, Jack and the truck driver.<eos> You know, they said, "when this guy comes in, you start a fight with him.<eos> Then I'll come in, save his ass, and he'll be eternally grateful."<eos> And later, in the parking lot, what Jack whispers in his ear, is...<eos> "thanks, buddy.
The woman on the run in your script she's about to have her throat slit. - What the fuck? - And you have her pleading with him.<eos> If she reacted like you just did that would be realistic.<eos> I just wanted to show you some real.<eos> Sorry for the scare.<eos> Jack!
Sorry for the scare.<eos> Jack!<eos> What's up?<eos> Did you hear that scream?<eos> - Scream?
Okay, bye.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> We had an agreement.<eos> - Now you're breaking it.<eos> - An agreement?
You point a gun at me, just because someone was at the door!<eos> I'm a little paranoid. So what?<eos> Where you going, Paul?<eos> Wherever the fuck I want to.<eos> What about the woman's scream?
- What's in the bag, Paul?<eos> - We had an agreement.<eos> - What do you want me to say?<eos> All right. I... I was going to drink.<eos> Alone.
Take off the hand brake, and start pushing the car into the pond.<eos> You, help him!<eos> Move!<eos> Move! Faster!<eos> Faster!
Move! Faster!<eos> Faster!<eos> Now move. Get up to the house.<eos> I'll get it.<eos> Marion?
I have a baby, please, let me...<eos> Please.<eos> You see how disorientated people get when their future is uncertain?<eos> They always tend to imagine the worst.<eos> You too, Paul.
You shouldn't leave your tools out in this weather, they'll get rusty. Yeah.<eos> I'll get around to it. - You know, it's been busy.<eos> - Listen, we're looking for this woman.<eos> I was wondering if by any chance you've seen her?<eos> Michelle Emerson?
- He just killed a fucking cop! - Laura, please!<eos> Stop it!<eos> It's about thinking now, all right?<eos> How old is your kid?<eos> Two.
You let her go, Jack!<eos> Where is she?<eos> What did you do to her?<eos> Which actor should play me?<eos> A fucking maniac.
I'm gonna show you reality.<eos> You build it.<eos> Now stand up.<eos> Stand up!<eos> All right, Jack.
This is our chance. This is our chance.<eos> We gotta go, we gotta go, we gotta go.<eos> Did you check the prints?<eos> - Good job.<eos> Thanks.
When providence signals to me I recognize it instantly.<eos> A woman alone in her car waiting for her boyfriend to get out work.<eos> I hate myself for not catching you before you got to Nancy Barrows.<eos> I'll carry that to my grave.<eos> Four victims.
Everything you have in that bag is tainted.<eos> Planted.<eos> You're so in need of a scapegoat that it's pathetic.<eos> You come To my house with a bag of evidence you collected from the bodies. Bodies you had access to, and trying to hang it on me?<eos> The tape?
All right.<eos> Look at this photograph.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Better times, huh?
Better times, huh?<eos> Your beautiful wife outside of your rustic retreat.<eos> But something's missing.<eos> Tell me something, Paul. If I was to dig underneath your pond I mean, really underneath your pond would I find your wife?<eos> All right, Jack.
I'm all ears.<eos> You have no idea the pain I'm holding inside. Just don't! Listen to me.<eos> Hear me out.<eos> This is an idea for a... for a deal.<eos> Full confession.
You gotta use the stuff they use.<eos> See?<eos> All right.<eos> Glad you could join us.<eos> Afternoon.
Glad you could join us.<eos> Afternoon.<eos> - My alarm's been going off...<eos> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> Your alarm.
All post battle cleanup operations are now under our jurisdiction.<eos> Thank you for your service.<eos> We'll take it from here.<eos> - Who the hell are you?<eos> - Qualified personnel.
He's right.<eos> I overextended myself.<eos> Put them down.<eos> If you have a grievance, you may take it up with my superiors.<eos> Your superiors?
The world's changing.<eos> It's time we change, too.<eos> Here you go, Mason.<eos> Business is good.<eos> New York, Queens.
Business is good.<eos> New York, Queens.<eos> It's a rough borough, but hey, it's home.<eos> - Who are you talking to?<eos> - No one.

You got this.<eos> - What the hell are you wearing?<eos> - It's my suit.<eos> - Where's the case?<eos> What case?
I thought that was a closet.<eos> This is still my room?<eos> My room is way bigger than I...<eos> Hey, I found the case.<eos> "A minor upgrade"?
This is still my room?<eos> My room is way bigger than I...<eos> Hey, I found the case.<eos> "A minor upgrade"?<eos> Woah!
- Let's go!<eos> - But, I don't understand, is--- is it for me?<eos> Happy, Happy, wait!<eos> This is insane!<eos> Insane!
There's a little gray area in there and that's where you operate.<eos> - Wait, does that mean that I'm an Avenger?<eos> - No.<eos> - He's at?<eos> - Seventh floor.

- Yep.<eos> You, in my office, right now!<eos> Join me, and together, we'll build my new Lego Death Star.<eos> - What?<eos> ! - So lame.
- I know!<eos> - You wanna build it tonight?<eos> - I can't tonight.<eos> I got the Stark internship.<eos> - Stark internship.
Because for the most part, the difficult thing will be just the base of it.<eos> The top half will....<eos> That'd be great.<eos> Okay, so how do we calculate linear acceleration between points A and B?<eos> Flash.
Okay, so how do we calculate linear acceleration between points A and B?<eos> Flash.<eos> It's the product of sine of the angle and gravity, divided by the mass.<eos> Nope.<eos> Peter.
Did Liz get a new top?<eos> No.<eos> We've seen that before, but...<eos> - never with that skirt.<eos> - Liz!
Let's move to the next question: What is the heaviest naturally occuring element?<eos> Hydrogen's the lightest.<eos> That's not the question.<eos> Ok.<eos> - Uranium.

How's your mother?<eos> I'm good.<eos> I'm good.<eos> You have reached the voice mailbox of Happy Hogan.<eos> Hey, Happy.
I just, feel like I could be doing more, you know.<eos> I'm just curious when our next real mission's gonna be.<eos> So yeah, just call me back.<eos> It's Peter.<eos> Parker.

You said we were gonna finish the Death Star!<eos> You can't just bust into my room.<eos> That turkey meat loaf recipe is a disaster.<eos> Let's go to dinner.<eos> Thai, Ned?
Yeah.<eos> Basically.<eos> You can't tell anybody about this.<eos> You gotta keep it a secret.<eos> - A secret, why?
You can't tell anybody about this.<eos> You gotta keep it a secret.<eos> - A secret, why?<eos> - If she finds out people try and kill me every single night, she's not gonna let me do this anymore.<eos> - C'mon Ned.
- No.<eos> - Is it magnets?<eos> How do you shoot the strings?<eos> - I'm gonna tell you about this at school tomorrow.<eos> Great.
Yeah.<eos> Of course.<eos> - Six blocks away from us!<eos> - I need a new backpack.<eos> - What?
You were here?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You could've died.<eos> - Do you lay eggs?<eos> - What?
No.<eos> - Can you spit venom?<eos> - No.<eos> - Can you summon an army of spiders?<eos> - No, Ned.
Don't know.<eos> Shut up.<eos> If I was you, I would stand on the edge of a building and just shoot it as far as I can...<eos> Shut up, Ned.<eos> Hi.
I bet he smells nice.<eos> - Ned, shut up.<eos> - Is Captain America cool?<eos> - Or is he like a mean, old grandpa?<eos> - Ned, just shh.
- Ned, just shh.<eos> Okay?<eos> Hey...<eos> - Can I be your guy in the chair?<eos> - What?
Hey...<eos> - Can I be your guy in the chair?<eos> - What?<eos> You know how there's a guy, with a headset, telling the other guy where to go?<eos> Like...
He fought off 4 guys!<eos> - Oh, my gosh.<eos> She's crushing on Spider-Man.<eos> - No way.<eos> - Kind of!
- Oh, my gosh.<eos> She's crushing on Spider-Man.<eos> - No way.<eos> - Kind of!<eos> - Ugh.
She's crushing on Spider-Man.<eos> - No way.<eos> - Kind of!<eos> - Ugh.<eos> Gross.

It's okay.<eos> I know Peter's way too busy for parties anyway, so...<eos> Aw, c'mon.<eos> He'll be there.<eos> Right, Parker?

I remember these.<eos> - I'm kinda jealous!<eos> - It'll be a night to remember.<eos> Aww...<eos> Ned...

And you should have a party.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm gonna go.<eos> I'm gonna go.<eos> - Peter!
You're here, too.<eos> Am I?<eos> Oh, my gosh.<eos> Hey, guys!<eos> Cool hat, Ned.
Oh, my gosh.<eos> Hey, guys!<eos> Cool hat, Ned.<eos> - Hi, Liz!<eos> - Hi, Liz.

Almost got ya!<eos> Thought you'd get away from me, didn't you?<eos> I gotcha!<eos> Right where I want you!<eos> Surprise!
- What were you thinking?<eos> The guy with the wings is obviously the source of the weapons.<eos> I gotta take him down.<eos> Take him down now, huh?<eos> - Steady, Crockett.
I guess we're still losers.<eos> I'll see you tomorrow.<eos> I'll see you tomorrow in school.<eos> Idiots.<eos> Idiots.
I'll see you tomorrow.<eos> I'll see you tomorrow in school.<eos> Idiots.<eos> Idiots.<eos> Idiots!
And you're out there, wearing that goofy thing, lighting up cars...<eos> Calling yourself "The Shocker." I'm the Shocker.<eos> I shock people.<eos> - What is this, pro wrestling?<eos> - Yeah, whatever, old man.
Look, look.<eos> I know, you don't give a crap about anything.<eos> But I do.<eos> I built this whole place because I got people I have to look after.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> You know what?<eos> I can't afford your bullshit.<eos> - Get outta here.<eos> - What?
- Excuse me?<eos> I'm just saying...<eos> Maybe your wife would like to know where you really get your money from.<eos> - You know what?<eos> - What?
Maybe your wife would like to know where you really get your money from.<eos> - You know what?<eos> - What?<eos> You're right.<eos> - That work?
- I don't know.<eos> I can't afford that.<eos> Damn!<eos> - I thought this was the anti-gravity gun.<eos> - What?
- Seriously?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Awesome!<eos> I mean, not awesome.<eos> Totally uncool, that guy.
Come on, come on, come on.<eos> High schools creep me out.<eos> It's got this funny smell, you know what I mean?<eos> - That's one of the guys that tried to kill me.<eos> - What?
Maybe they can lead me to the guy that dropped me in a lake.<eos> - Someone dropped you in a lake?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> It was not good.<eos> - Peter.
It was not good.<eos> - Peter.<eos> - No.<eos> Stay there, Ned.<eos> Peter!
- No.<eos> Stay there, Ned.<eos> Peter!<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - Nothing.
So are we...<eos> This is so awesome.<eos> I know, right.<eos> In Brooklyn.<eos> Staten Island.
In Brooklyn.<eos> Staten Island.<eos> Leaving Jersey.<eos> They stopped.<eos> - Maryland?
They stopped.<eos> - Maryland?<eos> - What's there?<eos> I don't know, evil lair?<eos> - Evil lair?
- Badass.<eos> But, how are you gonna get there if that's like, 300 miles away?<eos> It's not too far from DC.<eos> - Hey, it's Peter!<eos> - Guys!
- No. No way.<eos> You can't just quit on us, stroll up, and be welcomed back by everyone.<eos> Hey, welcome back, Peter!<eos> Flash, you're back to first alternate.<eos> - What?
Let's get on the bus.<eos> Focus up, everyone.<eos> Our next topic is the moons of Saturn.<eos> - The second law of Thermodynamics.<eos> - Frank Sinatra.
Focus up, everyone.<eos> Our next topic is the moons of Saturn.<eos> - The second law of Thermodynamics.<eos> - Frank Sinatra.<eos> - Fort Sumpter.

- Okay guys, let's focus.<eos> Next one.<eos> - Liz, don't overwork 'em.<eos> - Strontium, Barium, Vibranium.<eos> - Very good, Peter.
Look, Happy...<eos> I gotta say, you tracking me without my permission is a complete violation of my privacy.<eos> - That's different.<eos> - What's different?<eos> Nothing.
And I don't really want Mr. Stark to know about it.<eos> - So you're lying to Iron Man now?<eos> - No, I'm not lying.<eos> He just doesn't really get what I can do yet.<eos> Gotcha.
Keep it safe, all right?<eos> Okay.<eos> - I'm moving.<eos> - Be careful.<eos> - Hey, Liz.
- Hey, Liz.<eos> - Perfect timing.<eos> We're gonna go swimming.<eos> Come on! Come on.<eos> Hey, Peter.
And besides, we raided the minibar and these candy bars were like $11.<eos> So get your trunks on and come on.<eos> - Come on.<eos> Come on. - I'm coming!<eos> - Good evening, Peter.
Uhh, yeah.<eos> Activating Enhanced Reconnaissance mode.<eos> I got the gauntlet from the Lagos cleanup.<eos> The rest is all mine.<eos> Whoa.
- Mr. Stark really overdid it.<eos> - You two wait right here.<eos> Wait, you're gonna wanna turn on the dampers or that thing will shatter your arm.<eos> - Where's the dampers?<eos> - That one!
- You two wait right here.<eos> Wait, you're gonna wanna turn on the dampers or that thing will shatter your arm.<eos> - Where's the dampers?<eos> - That one!<eos> Great choice!
- Right here?<eos> - No, no.<eos> Yeah, push it.<eos> - What was that?<eos> - Taser webs.
- Sure thing. - 6-Alpha-Niner, are you running on time?<eos> Copy, Central.<eos> 6-Alpha-Niner, on schedule.<eos> - I have a visual.<eos> - Green light.
Copy, Central.<eos> 6-Alpha-Niner, on schedule.<eos> - I have a visual.<eos> - Green light.<eos> Green light.
Dropping down.<eos> No outgoing distress signals.<eos> You're all clear.<eos> Looks like they got some good stuff here.<eos> Cool.
Cool.<eos> It's like some kind of matter phase shifter.<eos> All right.<eos> Coming up.<eos> Hey, big bird!
This doesn't belong to you!<eos> Oh, God.<eos> - Suit lady, what was that?<eos> - You told me to choose.<eos> What, no.
What, no.<eos> Just set everything back to normal!<eos> Activating all systems.<eos> - Oh.<eos> My head.
Wait a minute.<eos> They must've hijacked the truck and taken me to their evil lair.<eos> Okay.<eos> So maybe we're gonna have to fight our way out of this one.<eos> Three, two, one!
The Damage Control deep storage vault.<eos> No!<eos> Seriously?<eos> The door will most likely remain closed until morning.<eos> Morning?
Morning?<eos> Hey, suit lady.<eos> I kinda feel bad calling you "Suit Lady", you know?<eos> I think I should probably give you a name.<eos> Like Liz.
What else can this suit do?<eos> What?<eos> Maybe we should run that refresher course.<eos> - Ricochet web. - Ricochet web.<eos> - Cool.
What?<eos> Maybe we should run that refresher course.<eos> - Ricochet web. - Ricochet web.<eos> - Cool.<eos> - Stutter web.

It worked!<eos> It works!<eos> Please be sure all cellphones are turned off.<eos> KAREN, you have to get me to the decathlon as fast as possible!<eos> - Sure thing.
The glowy thing's a bomb!<eos> There's a vehicle approaching on your right.<eos> We have now entered sudden death.<eos> The next correct answer wins the championship.<eos> - Midtown Tech?
Oh, I'm sure the Washington Monument wasn't built by...<eos> Okay.<eos> Enjoy your book.<eos> Thanks.<eos> - Oh, Ned.
- Ned, Ned, where's the glowy thing?<eos> - Don't worry.<eos> It's safe.<eos> It's in my backpack.<eos> No, Ned!
It's safe.<eos> It's in my backpack.<eos> No, Ned!<eos> Listen!<eos> No, Ned!
- Ned, listen to me!<eos> - We're in the Washington Monument.<eos> How're you gonna...<eos> - Peter, is that you?<eos> - Oh, hey, Liz!
- Liz, I have to talk to Ned, it's really important!<eos> - Miss, all items on the belt, please.<eos> Liz, there's something in his backpack that is really dangerous.<eos> Don't let it go through an x-ray.<eos> Liz?

- We're very safe in here.<eos> - The occupants are in imminent mortal danger.<eos> I'm going as fast as I can!<eos> You now have 125 seconds until catastrophic failure.<eos> - What?
Why?<eos> - Unexpected motion has caused the deterioration to escalate.<eos> - How do I get in there?<eos> - Activating Reconnaissance Drone.<eos> Whoa.
You've reached the southwest window.<eos> - Why are you hesitating?<eos> - It's just I've never been this high before.<eos> You have also not reinstalled your parachute, so a fall from this height would most likely be lethal.<eos> Alright.
I did it!<eos> Hey, how you doing?<eos> Don't worry about it, I got you.<eos> Yes! Yes!<eos> - Hey, hey, hey!
- Okay.<eos> All right.<eos> This is your stop.<eos> Go, go, go.<eos> Everybody out.
Go, go, go.<eos> Everybody out.<eos> Move it people.<eos> Move it.<eos> Liz!
Kiss her.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Are you really friends with Peter Parker?<eos> I can finish the next order, but without any new materials from that truck...<eos> Dammit...
- Found him.<eos> The Spider-Man swooped in, heroically saving an academic decathlon team from Queens.<eos> The identity of the masked hero is still unknown.<eos> Mom!<eos> Peter.
Peter.<eos> Come here!<eos> This past weekend, Midtown's academic decathlon team defeated the country's best to win the national championship.<eos> Later that day, they also defeated death.<eos> Explosives!
- Thanks to the Spider-Man.<eos> - Thank you, Spider-Man.<eos> Up next: The Spider-Man mania is sweeping the school.<eos> How can you show your Spider spirit?<eos> Dude, dude, dude...
Up next: The Spider-Man mania is sweeping the school.<eos> How can you show your Spider spirit?<eos> Dude, dude, dude...<eos> What is it like being famous when nobody knows it's you?<eos> - Crazy, Ned.
- It is crazy!<eos> - Should we tell everyone?<eos> - No.<eos> - Should I tell everyone?<eos> - No, dude.
Mr. Stark is moving the Avengers upstate, so...<eos> - when I bring this guy in... - Dude!<eos> You wanna be a high school dropout?<eos> I am so far beyond high school right now.<eos> Parker!

So your body's changing.<eos> Believe me, I know how that feels.<eos> May?<eos> - Hey, KAREN, what's up?<eos> - Hey, Peter.
How was your Spanish quiz?<eos> Listen, I was wondering if you could help me.<eos> I'm trying to figure out who the guys... under the bridge were that night, but, I mean I can only kinda remember part of the license plate.<eos> I can run facial recognition on the footage of that encounter.<eos> - Footage?

Okay.<eos> The two on the right, who are they?<eos> Searching law enforcement databases...<eos> - No records found for two of the individuals.<eos> - Nothing?
I got a nephew who live here.<eos> Who are these guys?<eos> What can you tell me about the guy with the wings?<eos> Other than he's a psychopath dressed like a demon?<eos> Nothing.
Right.<eos> Of course.<eos> Yeah.<eos> My bad.<eos> Silly.
Can I give you some advice?<eos> You gotta get better at this part of the job.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> I'm intimidating.<eos> - The Staten Island Ferry. 11:00.
- Oh, that's soon.<eos> Hey that's gonna dissolve in two hours.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> Come fix this.<eos> - Two hours.
Bye, Mr. Criminal!<eos> Nice.<eos> Okay, KAREN.<eos> Activate Enhanced Reconnaissance mode.<eos> - Sure thing.
Okay, KAREN.<eos> Activate Enhanced Reconnaissance mode.<eos> - Sure thing.<eos> - He's out front.<eos> Main deck.
Incoming call from May Parker.<eos> Shall I reroute to your heads-up display?<eos> I can't talk right now.<eos> I'll call her back.<eos> Hey, Droney.
They got the weapons, the buyers, and the sellers all in one place.<eos> Incoming call from Tony Stark.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> Don't answer!<eos> - Mr. Parker.
Hey guys.<eos> The illegal weapons deal ferry was at 10:30.<eos> You missed it.<eos> Spider-guy's here.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, not so fast.
You missed it.<eos> Spider-guy's here.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, not so fast.<eos> Are you guys okay?<eos> My bad.
That was a little hard.<eos> I gotta say, the other guy was way better with that thing.<eos> And honestly, I'm-- - I'm shocked.<eos> Freeze!<eos> FBI!
You're messing with things you don't understand.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> What do I do?<eos> KAREN, give me an x-ray of the boat and target all the strongest points.<eos> Web grenade.

No!<eos> What the hell?<eos> What the hell?<eos> Hi, Spider-Man! "Band practice", was it?<eos> Yeah, Iron Man!
Yeah, I'm running.<eos> - You should, too.<eos> - You know I can't do that.<eos> - So now, what?<eos> - Mason.
- No, this is where you zip it!<eos> All right?<eos> The adult is talking.<eos> What if somebody had died tonight?<eos> Different story, right?
But you don't answer your phone.<eos> You can't do that.<eos> Then this ferry thing happens...<eos> I've called five police stations.<eos> Five.
Peter, you have to tell me what's going on.<eos> Just lay it out.<eos> It's just me and you.<eos> I lost the Stark internship.<eos> - What?
Do you have to go to that high school on 46th,<eos> - where the principal has a crossbow?<eos> - Pretty sure that's an urban myth, but no, I'm not expelled.<eos> You're so lucky.<eos> - Hey. - Hey.
- Sure.<eos> - Really?<eos> I mean, uhh...<eos> Great.<eos> Cool.
- Really?<eos> I mean, uhh...<eos> Great.<eos> Cool.<eos> - Cool.
Cool.<eos> - Cool.<eos> - I'm actually, going that way.<eos> May, I need your help!<eos> Right?
And, uhh...<eos> When I dance with her, I'll put my hands on her hips.<eos> Your daffodils.<eos> - Love you.<eos> - Bye.
- You must be Peter.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I'm Liz' Dad.<eos> Put her there.<eos> Hell of a grip!
Hi, Peter.<eos> - You look very handsome.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> You got his name, right?<eos> - Freddy?

We have to take some pictures, Babe.<eos> Right here.<eos> Perfect. Okay...<eos> Come on, you guys.<eos> Peter, closer.
- Bye, Peter.<eos> Have fun.<eos> - Yeah, I will.<eos> - What are you gonna do, Pete?<eos> - What?
No, I'm just a sophomore.<eos> Peter has an internship with Tony Stark, so,<eos> - I think he doesn't have to worry.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Stark?
- Boring.<eos> - It was boring?<eos> - You got to hang out with Spider-Man.<eos> - Really?<eos> Spider-Man?
- It was boring?<eos> - You got to hang out with Spider-Man.<eos> - Really?<eos> Spider-Man?<eos> Wow.
Spider-Man?<eos> Wow.<eos> What's he like?<eos> Yeah, he's nice.<eos> Nice man.
Wow.<eos> What's he like?<eos> Yeah, he's nice.<eos> Nice man.<eos> Solid dude.
I mean...<eos> Somewhere.<eos> We've, uhh...<eos> Have we ever?<eos> Because even the voice...
I bet you were glad when your old pal Spider-Man showed up in the elevator though, huh?<eos> Yeah, well, I... I actually didn't go up.<eos> I saw it all from the ground.<eos> Pretty lucky that he was there that day.<eos> Good ol' Spider-Man.
Yeah, well, I... I actually didn't go up.<eos> I saw it all from the ground.<eos> Pretty lucky that he was there that day.<eos> Good ol' Spider-Man.<eos> Dad.
I saw it all from the ground.<eos> Pretty lucky that he was there that day.<eos> Good ol' Spider-Man.<eos> Dad.<eos> The light.
He gave you a choice.<eos> You chose wrong.<eos> - What the hell?<eos> - What's with the crappy costume?<eos> My web shooters.
So...<eos> Flash, I need your car and your phone.<eos> Sir, technically this is my dad's car, sir.<eos> So I can't---<eos> - Hello, Ned?
Flash, I need your car and your phone.<eos> Sir, technically this is my dad's car, sir.<eos> So I can't---<eos> - Hello, Ned?<eos> Hey, hey, hey.
- Hello, Ned?<eos> Hey, hey, hey.<eos> Can you hear me?<eos> - Go for Ned.<eos> Ned.
- Go for Ned.<eos> Ned.<eos> I need you to track my phone for me.<eos> Yeah, but where is it?<eos> Genius move.
Hello?<eos> - Hello?<eos> Who is this?<eos> - Mr. Happy, it's Ned.<eos> - Who?
- Who?<eos> - I'm an associate of Peter Parker.<eos> - He has something very important to tell you...<eos> - You gotta be shitting me.<eos> - Damn! - Hey, Ned.
So where's my phone now?<eos> - He stopped in an old industrial park in Brooklyn. - What?<eos> That makes no sense.<eos> - I thought he said he was going out of town.<eos> - Weird.
Oh, I reached Mr. Happy.<eos> Don't think he likes you, by the way.<eos> It sounded like he was catching a flight.<eos> - He said something about taking off in 9 minutes.<eos> - What?
It sounded like he was catching a flight.<eos> - He said something about taking off in 9 minutes.<eos> - What?<eos> - He was surrounded by a bunch of boxes.<eos> - Boxes?
I gotta stop him.<eos> All right.<eos> Wheels up in 8 minutes.<eos> We just gotta load Tony's old Hulkbuster armor, prototype for Cap's new shield, and the Megging...<eos> the Meg...
Thor's magic belt.<eos> Okay, slow down.<eos> You're getting close.<eos> It's on your right.<eos> - What?
It's on your right.<eos> - What?<eos> - Turn right.<eos> Turn right!<eos> - Peter!
What are you doing here?<eos> There's a dance.<eos> I'm... looking... at porn.<eos> - Surprised?<eos> - Oh, hey, Pete.
I'm not doing anything to her, Pete.<eos> I'm doing this, for her.<eos> Hmm.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Peter.
You don't understand how the world works.<eos> Yeah, but I understand that selling weapons to criminals is wrong.<eos> How do you think your buddy Stark paid for that tower?<eos> Or any of his little toys?<eos> Those people, Pete, those people up there, the rich and powerful...
Or any of his little toys?<eos> Those people, Pete, those people up there, the rich and powerful...<eos> They do whatever they want.<eos> Guys like us...<eos> Like you and me...
And... I needed a little time to get her airborne.<eos> I'm sorry, Peter.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> That thing hasn't even touched me yet.<eos> True.
It wasn't really trying to.<eos> - Chief, they're powering those engines.<eos> C'mon. - Okay.<eos> Yeah. Yeah.<eos> Okay, ready?
- Chief, they're powering those engines.<eos> C'mon. - Okay.<eos> Yeah. Yeah.<eos> Okay, ready?<eos> Hello? !

You have 30 seconds to get to the cockpit and override their security.<eos> - Cloning transponder signal.<eos> - Launching decoy drone.<eos> Entering new coordinates.<eos> - Good.
Right on course.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> All right.<eos> Hot dog.
Get out of there!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> !<eos> Please turn, please turn!<eos> Hey, Pedro.

It was so...<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> And you saved me.<eos> Awesome.<eos> Hey, Liz!
And you saved me.<eos> Awesome.<eos> Hey, Liz!<eos> I'm gonna miss you.<eos> Liz.
Liz.<eos> Liz, look, I'm so sorry.<eos> You say that a lot.<eos> What are you sorry for this time?<eos> The dance?
What are you sorry for this time?<eos> The dance?<eos> That, was a pretty crappy thing to do.<eos> Yeah, but...<eos> Your Dad.
I guess we're moving to Oregon.<eos> Mom says it's nice there, so that's cool.<eos> Anyways,<eos> Dad doesn't want us here during the trial, so...<eos> Liz, I... I...
Mom says it's nice there, so that's cool.<eos> Anyways,<eos> Dad doesn't want us here during the trial, so...<eos> Liz, I... I...<eos> Bye, Peter.
I don't care.<eos> Bye.<eos> Alright.<eos> So, we should run some drills.<eos> Hey, Happy.
They just finished remodelling the whole thing.<eos> - You don't see that everyday.<eos> - Oh, there they are.<eos> - How was the ride out?<eos> - Good.
There's about 50 reporters behind that door.<eos> Real ones, not bloggers.<eos> When you're ready... I want you to try that on.<eos> And I'll introduce the world to the newest official member of the Avengers:<eos> Spider-Man.
But, I... I'm good.<eos> You're good?<eos> Good, how are you good?<eos> I mean, I'd rather just stay on the ground, for a little while.<eos> Friendly, neighborhood Spider-Man.
Are you turning me down?<eos> You better think about this.<eos> Look at that.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Last chance: Yes or No?
Look at that.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Last chance: Yes or No?<eos> - No.<eos> - Okay.
Buy us a little time.<eos> Like we need time.<eos> - I can't believe you have that thing in your pocket.<eos> - Can I get the door for you, Hon?<eos> Alright.
- I can't believe you have that thing in your pocket.<eos> - Can I get the door for you, Hon?<eos> Alright.<eos> Hey, May, did you get dinner already?<eos> May?

Mother, retract the energy cells.<eos> And channel all useless power.<eos> Emergency.<eos> Threat level:<eos> CRITICAL.

The current structural integrity of the ship is holding at 83%... but we have many secondary systems that are offline.<eos> So what was it?<eos> A highly charge shock wave from nearby stellar ignition.<eos> As the cells were deploying for recharge... we absorbed the full burn of the storm.<eos> And Walter...
Absolutely agreed.<eos> So let's get to work ok?<eos> Dismissed.<eos> Thank you.<eos> C-62 open.
Secured.<eos> Copy that.<eos> Wasn't my idea.<eos> Jake have this dream of us building a cabin on the new world.<eos> Like pioneers.
Now I wonder, why bother?<eos> Because you promised to build a log cabin on a lake.<eos> This was his favorite.<eos> A man of taste.<eos> Straight up.
A man of taste.<eos> Straight up.<eos> No ice, no water, no chaser.<eos> No shit.<eos> Walter?
When in Rome...<eos> To all the good people gone to soon.<eos> May we remember that.<eos> Remember that.<eos> Chris.
Alright, I'm following you in.<eos> Please have a cold beer ready for the weary traveler.<eos> You got it, darling.<eos> I will draw circle..<eos> Faris, Faris?
A rogue transmission loss, probably.<eos> Your helmet must have picked it up because you were so far out.<eos> Past our communication buffers.<eos> Is there audio, Mother?<eos> Collating.
But old, very old.<eos> Five planets.<eos> Wait.<eos> Look at that.<eos> Planet number four.
How did we miss this?<eos> We scanned the entire sector.<eos> Ricks, how far is it?<eos> She's close.<eos> Little jump.
And this has the potential... to be a better habitat for a colony.<eos> It has the potential.<eos> We don't know that.<eos> By the way, this crew nobody... Nobody wants to get back in the pods.<eos> Right?
You understand?<eos> As your second I need to protest.<eos> Officially.<eos> Officially?<eos> Okay, Danny.
You're clear to launch Lander one.<eos> Alright, here we go. Launching...<eos> Together.<eos> Three.<eos> Two.
Alright, here we go. Launching...<eos> Together.<eos> Three.<eos> Two.<eos> One.
This is why you need to do yoga.<eos> - Hold it, Faris.<eos> - I got it.<eos> Recommend the mission to abort..<eos> Faris.
Recommend the mission to abort..<eos> Faris.<eos> Can you get her up?<eos> We lost comm.<eos> Oh shit.
Is there anyway you can try to boost the signal?<eos> We may have hit something when we were down in water.<eos> If you can hear me, I am gonna go, check up damage in the hull plates and then I will check the uplink.<eos> Alright, let me know how it looks.<eos> Over..
Alright, let me know how it looks.<eos> Over..<eos> Confirming atmospheric composition.<eos> Here you go, big guy.<eos> Oxygen, 19.5%.

The signal source is 8 km west... but at considerable elevation.<eos> Sergeant Lope... Let's go find our ghost.<eos> Nice place for a log cabin.<eos> Jake would have loved this.<eos> Hey, Danny.
This is wheat.<eos> Believe me, I know wheat.<eos> This is old, but definitely cultivated.<eos> What are the odds of finding human vegetation... this far from Earth?<eos> Very unlikely.
Eat.<eos> Hey babe, try alpha.<eos> Alright, Alpha's up.<eos> Nothing, give beta a shot..<eos> Beta...
I don't know.<eos> Few hours.<eos> - Keep up the pace. Take low.<eos> - Careful guys.<eos> Chris.
Well, it had to be huge.<eos> Well, Whatever it is... It's up there.<eos> You hear that?<eos> What?<eos> Nothing.

Stay here.<eos> - You got it.<eos> - Yes sir.<eos> Careful guys, watch your step.<eos> Captain.
- This way.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Stick together.<eos> Seeing this shit?<eos> Tom.
Yeah, yeah, I am fine.<eos> God!<eos> They were giants.<eos> At least statues of giants.<eos> "Dr. E. Shaw".

Oram, behind you, look.<eos> I think we found our source.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What the hell was she doing out here?<eos> Poor thing.
It's uh.. something about Ledward.<eos> They're coming.<eos> Let's move.<eos> - Guys!<eos> - Tom!
What's going on man?<eos> Hey, You alright?<eos> - Talk to me.<eos> Hey, Look at me.<eos> - Ankor, Cole.
- I can't.<eos> We are almost there.<eos> You see?<eos> Straight ahead.<eos> Faris!
Come on! Help.<eos> Karine, put the gloves on.<eos> Don't touch anything!<eos> - Stop saying that!<eos> - Faris!
Calm down, sweetheart. Tell me what's happening.<eos> You don't tell me to fucking calm down!<eos> You didn't just see what I saw.<eos> I do not know what the fuck Ledward got, or Karine's got or if I have it.<eos> - Tee!
You don't tell me to fucking calm down!<eos> You didn't just see what I saw.<eos> I do not know what the fuck Ledward got, or Karine's got or if I have it.<eos> - Tee!<eos> - Faris!
I can't do this.<eos> I need to keep the infection local.<eos> Let me fuck out!<eos> Let me the fuck out!<eos> Faris!
Open the door!<eos> Let me the fuck out!<eos> Let me out!<eos> Faris, you fuck!<eos> Faris!
Lander One, Repeat!<eos> Lander One, Repeat!<eos> Stay the fuck away!<eos> No!<eos> Karine!
No!<eos> Karine!<eos> Fuck it!<eos> - Oh my God!<eos> - Karine!
Fuck it!<eos> - Oh my God!<eos> - Karine!<eos> Hold on!<eos> Captain!
Well then we fly it through it.<eos> We can not do that, Tennessee.<eos> You're a pilot, you know what the tolerances are.<eos> Fuck the tolerances.<eos> Tee...

Thus, I have been marooned here these many years.<eos> Crusoe on his island.<eos> Our crew was infected with this virus?<eos> The pathogen was designed to infect all non-botanical life forms.<eos> All the animals...
The pathogen was designed to infect all non-botanical life forms.<eos> All the animals...<eos> The meat, if you will.<eos> Either kill them out right or use them... as incubators to spawn a hybrid form.<eos> Highly aggressive.
You'd know by now.<eos> We have to be certain.<eos> We can't take this back to the ship.<eos> We are a colony mission.<eos> Really?
We have to be certain.<eos> We can't take this back to the ship.<eos> We are a colony mission.<eos> Really?<eos> How extraordinary.
Everyone, let's uh.. Set up a stake here.. There is so much here that doesn't make sense.<eos> I will talk to him.<eos> Brother to brother.<eos> Tennessee?<eos> Ricks?
Days.<eos> Weeks.<eos> Months.<eos> But do keep at it..<eos> Best of luck.
Duly noted..<eos> Whistle, and I will come.<eos> You have a light step. They enform on little cat feet. Don't be shy.<eos> I can't play.<eos> Nonsense.
Hold it like so..<eos> Nice and Easy.<eos> Now compress your lips to create your Embouchure... enough for the tip of your little finger.<eos> And blow into the hole gently.<eos> Like So.
Watch me.<eos> I'll do the fingering.<eos> Go on.<eos> Very good.<eos> G to B flat.
Damn frustrating. I'd say.<eos> You disturbed people.<eos> I beg your pardon?<eos> You were too human.<eos> Too idiosyncratic.
- I gotta clean up, okay?<eos> - Okay.<eos> Wait, don't go far, please.<eos> Yes sir.<eos> Danny.
It just gonna be our new home.<eos> And we have lost five...<eos> We lost five crew members.<eos> - Because of my decisions that...<eos> - Chris.
- Chris.<eos> We all lost people we loved.<eos> We can't lose anymore.<eos> We are not gonna let that happen right?<eos> - Right?
- Right?<eos> - That's right.<eos> That's right, that's right.<eos> We need your faith.<eos> Captain.

Mother, bring us within 40 km's of the storm.<eos> - Sir!<eos> - I am sorry.<eos> That order would exceed structural tolerance.<eos> Command override.
- Sir!<eos> - I am sorry.<eos> That order would exceed structural tolerance.<eos> Command override.<eos> Tennessee 0-4-9-8-3.
No, no, I'll go.<eos> Move.<eos> Don't shoot.<eos> Don't shoot.<eos> Communication, Captain.

Maggie's gone.<eos> I'm so sorry, Tee.<eos> We tried to help her, but we didn't make it.<eos> Tee?<eos> Copy.
From the eggs came these parasites...<eos> Shock troops of the genetic assault.<eos> Waiting for a host entering the host... rewriting the DNA... Ultimately... producing... well,<eos> these enviable unions.<eos> My beautiful bestiary.
You engineered this, David?<eos> Idle hands is the devil's workshop, Captain.<eos> Come.<eos> This is what I wanted to show you.<eos> My successes.
Patch her through.<eos> Tee, I need you to launch now.<eos> Aye, aye, launching now.<eos> See you soon darling.<eos> Thanks, Tee.

Sleep well.<eos> Walter.<eos> When we get there, will you help me build my cabin?<eos> The cabin on the lake.<eos> David?
Welcome.<eos> How may I help you?<eos> How about some music, Mother?<eos> Selection?<eos> Richard Wagner.
Does it say, "I grabbed it outta my suitcase" "and went to the beach" or "girl who overplans for vacation outfits"?<eos> There's just a picture of a bird on it.<eos> No, I mean, like, its vibe, you know? Like, what's its vibe?<eos> It's perfect for Ecuador.<eos> Yeah. And, like, why Ecuador?
Okay. Thanks, anyway.<eos> Have fun on your trip.<eos> Nice meeting you.<eos> I hope you find your keys.<eos> Oh, my keys.
I'm re-racking clothes you know what?<eos> I'm done.<eos> I need this job. Can you just think about this?<eos> Look at the other employees.<eos> Like, what about this bitch?
Like, what about this bitch?<eos> I've never seen her do shit.<eos> You don't do shit here!<eos> She doesn't work here.<eos> Oh, okay.
I've never seen her do shit.<eos> You don't do shit here!<eos> She doesn't work here.<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> Hi.
Put the damn hat down!<eos> I looked her right in the eye, and I went<eos> "I wouldn't work here if you paid me."<eos> And I just stormed out.<eos> Just like, for real.
Look. This is the thing.<eos> Where I'm going, there's gonna be a ton of...<eos> Inspiration...<eos> Inspiration?<eos> No, pussy.
Inspiration...<eos> Inspiration?<eos> No, pussy.<eos> I keep talking over you, but it's sounding like you're saying...<eos> Pussy.
You're great but I have a lot going on right now.<eos> Yeah, I'm heartbroken.<eos> You're gonna meet someone so special.<eos> Okay, I'm gonna go.<eos> Bye.
Listen, honey,<eos> I want you to be really careful because there was some kind of heist in Delaware.<eos> Yeah, and I know you're in New York and everything but you can never be too safe, honey.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, guys.
Who the hell does he think he is?<eos> How do you know I didn't break up with him?<eos> Did you?<eos> No.<eos> Of course not.
All right, this is a long hug.<eos> I know. One more minute.<eos> I haven't seen you in, like, forever.<eos> Can we just move this hug along?<eos> Hello, Philip.
What a shock.<eos> Okay, don't start! What?<eos> Agoraphobia is not a joke.<eos> Mama, mama, mama... oh.<eos> Hey, em.
Okay. No, we don't.<eos> You have the exact same haircut, too.<eos> You know who you have the haircut of?<eos> Who's that?<eos> Harry Potter.
Harry Potter is the greatest of all the wizards. He's a hero and a great role model.<eos> So, I'll take it as a compliment.<eos> Mom, can I have a chocolate milk?<eos> Oh, god, mama! Mama!<eos> Yeah?
You suck mom's dick.<eos> Guys! Cool it!<eos> If you keep this up, I'm not cooking anymore and I'm not feeding you.<eos> Stop it.<eos> Truce.
Guys! Cool it!<eos> If you keep this up, I'm not cooking anymore and I'm not feeding you.<eos> Stop it.<eos> Truce.<eos> Truce. Arthur!
Sure, honey.<eos> Go into the hall closet.<eos> Pack your bags.<eos> You're going with me to Ecuador.<eos> Absolutely not.
It's your home. You put it where you want it, but it's an upsetting image.<eos> Okay. Mom, look, I didn't want to do this but here it goes.<eos> What?<eos> My trip... Yeah? Is non-refundable.<eos> Oh, my god!
My trip... Yeah? Is non-refundable.<eos> Oh, my god!<eos> Yeah. You always book refundable, Emily! Everybody knows that!<eos> I know, but... Look, it's done, and no one else will go with me.<eos> No one.
Oh, well... Are you afraid these dogs are gonna rape me? Is that the main concern?<eos> Can I just see that?<eos> I didn't look at the dogs.<eos> Do they look like rapists to you?<eos> Whatever!
This is me.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Oh, thank you very much.<eos> What's this?<eos> "Whale" what?
I'm sorry, I cannot.<eos> So I'm just gonna share a king-size bed in a romantic locale with my mother?<eos> You can sleep head-to-toe.<eos> Like we're 69-ing.<eos> Great.
Great.<eos> I know what that means, you know. "69-ing."<eos> Really, mom? What does it mean?<eos> Don't test me.<eos> Hey. Hi.
Mmm-hmm. Sure do.<eos> Hey, honey, you're gonna break your toes in these.<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> These flip-flops are bad for your feet.<eos> Okay, all right.
Oh, that's nice.<eos> I didn't know they had a day care program at the hotel.<eos> So, I don't get it.<eos> It's gross. It is gross.<eos> Oh, god!
Let's go out tonight.<eos> What? No, I can't.<eos> Yeah, you and me. We're going out.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Why? Hair, make-up, boobs.
Finally getting some peace.<eos> You know, she was in special ops.<eos> And she's seen some shit.<eos> Hi, Barb!<eos> Special ops!
Uh, not you. It was me. Excuse me?<eos> Could you kind of beat it? 'Cause you're a distraction.<eos> Hey, how are you?<eos> I'm James.<eos> Emily. Hi, Emily.
Do you wanna do something tonight?<eos> Like, something crazy, or can we do something amazing?<eos> Yeah!<eos> I'm sure we can rustle up some adventure tonight.<eos> Yes! Yeah.
Yes! Yeah.<eos> Everything okay over here, Emily?<eos> I met them at the pool. Oh, you guys.<eos> Remember, never have more drinks than you have tits.<eos> Two tits, two drinks.
Ride or die.<eos> Barb, you're wiling' out right now.<eos> Thank you, Barb.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey.
Hey, do you know what? Shall we?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Hey, what kind of soup?<eos> Um, that is none of your business.<eos> Really? What? What?
Here we go.<eos> What is this?<eos> Check it out.<eos> No.<eos> Oh, my god!
It is a tree.<eos> You're gonna know all these people by the end of it.<eos> Yes. Hola! Just two of those.<eos> That's Capoeira.<eos> Oh, shit!
I have to 69 my mom.<eos> Well, how about, then you set your alarm for 9:00 a.M and we will go on another adventure?<eos> Yeah!<eos> I would love it.<eos> Oh, shit.
Are you getting it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I was doing it better before.<eos> What is this haunted swan doing here?<eos> Scram, swan!
Here he comes.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Yes! Here you go.<eos> Thank you! Thanks.<eos> Hey, cheers!
What? Do you hear yourself?<eos> Why are you a life-ruiner?<eos> Do you know what?<eos> She is kind of right 'cause I think we'd save probably a whole five minutes.<eos> So... Okay.
Why are you a life-ruiner?<eos> Do you know what?<eos> She is kind of right 'cause I think we'd save probably a whole five minutes.<eos> So... Okay.<eos> Waterfalls and rainbows.
Oh, my god!<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Where are we?<eos> Why would they take us? Oh, my god!<eos> Oh, fuck! Ew. Ew.
You got Jeffrey.<eos> Hello, Jeffrey.<eos> We have your mother and your sister.<eos> And you will now pay ransom.<eos> Pardon?
My knees.<eos> Keep up!<eos> Oh, shit! I told you not to wear your flip-flops!<eos> It wasn't flip-flop related, mother.<eos> Oh, shit!
I saw his brains.<eos> Why can't you just make me feel better?<eos> Oh, my god. Thank you so much.<eos> You are such a sweetie.<eos> What?
Why can't you just make me feel better?<eos> Oh, my god. Thank you so much.<eos> You are such a sweetie.<eos> What?<eos> Hector morgado?
I should have stayed at the hotel.<eos> I can't fight with you right now. I'm starving.<eos> Do you hear my stomach? It's, like, crazy. I'm so hungry.<eos> - Oh, my god.<eos> - A phone!
We really need... 1991, Kuwait.<eos> Hot as fuck...<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> This place seems okay.<eos> Hi.
Why did you come to south America?<eos> I didn't want to come.<eos> I never wanted to come. For the cultural experience and the red cross.<eos> You come down here you stay at your fancy resort clutching your pearls. Look at my people like you are at the zoo.<eos> What the fuck?
I didn't make the rules.<eos> Not this one.<eos> Okay. Hold on.<eos> Look!<eos> A spear gun.
Okay, I'm gonna distract them.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I'm gonna distract them!<eos> You're distracting them?<eos> My son!
Where are you going?<eos> I'm gonna distract them!<eos> You're distracting them?<eos> My son!<eos> My son! My only son!

Shut the fuck up, Roger!<eos> My son!<eos> My only son!<eos> - Go! - Let's go!<eos> Manuel! Quickly, the boat!
I can't relax.<eos> The most terrifying man I ever saw in my life was going to cut us up in little pieces with his machete.<eos> And that was before you murdered his son.<eos> Accidentally murdered.<eos> But, mom.
The most terrifying man I ever saw in my life was going to cut us up in little pieces with his machete.<eos> And that was before you murdered his son.<eos> Accidentally murdered.<eos> But, mom.<eos> What?
Let's focus on that.<eos> Roger's going to get us home just like James was taking you out on a date.<eos> Get it?<eos> Judgment.<eos> Linda, Emily.
Sure.<eos> Oh, wait, do you mean, like, is it poisonous?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Probably.<eos> Oh, my god!
Oh, my god!<eos> Ladies, listen to me.<eos> There's always a risk if you want to feast on the sack.<eos> At some point, you're gonna have to pick your poison.<eos> Starvation or poison.
Ladies, listen to me.<eos> There's always a risk if you want to feast on the sack.<eos> At some point, you're gonna have to pick your poison.<eos> Starvation or poison.<eos> Vatmonos.
Vatmonos.<eos> And, gosh, wasn't it weird how soggy the wood was when I tried to light it?<eos> So weird.<eos> Linda, thanks for stepping up. You really did a great job.<eos> Yeah.
And just over this Ridge that's the quickest way to Bogota.<eos> We're going to swing over to the other side.<eos> One at a time.<eos> I'll go first 'cause I'm the man.<eos> Fuck! Shit! Okay, okay.

I don't think you're gonna enjoy that.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> I'll come to your house, and I'll fuck your dick.<eos> You know what? Hold up.<eos> Yo, yo, yo!
You know what? You're wrong!<eos> Because I had you. And I had your brother.<eos> So don't you dare say I wasted my life.<eos> I gave you everything I had.<eos> Everything!
I'm on this trip, Emily, because you didn't want to drink mai tais alone.<eos> No!<eos> You are the mergle fur!<eos> What the hell is mergle fur?<eos> Oh, Emily!
- Thanks, macho. - You ready?<eos> Yeah, we're gonna head out of here.<eos> Oh, you can't go just yet.<eos> Um, you have a parasite in you.<eos> What?
Hi. Do you feel better?<eos> I feel great.<eos> - Oh, good. - Yeah.<eos> You did good.<eos> Hi, maco.
Which part of our fight?<eos> Emily, come on. I didn't mean that.<eos> It's fine.<eos> I know how you see me.<eos> Shit, shit, shit, shit.
Mom!<eos> Mom! Everything's gonna be okay.<eos> I love you!<eos> Hello.<eos> Emily.
Mom! Everything's gonna be okay.<eos> I love you!<eos> Hello.<eos> Emily.<eos> Hi.
Because I am selfish.<eos> And I need help finding her right now, and I need you to be the guy that helps me.<eos> Come on, man. Be that guy.<eos> Who's the guy?<eos> Not me!
Hell, no.<eos> Choose your next move carefully, brother.<eos> Wait! No, no, no!<eos> Don't touch me.<eos> Security!
I'm coming with.<eos> You're not going anywhere.<eos> I think I see them right there.<eos> Is that them?<eos> Little specks there?
Go, go in the hallway.<eos> Fuck! Nerd.<eos> So what's the plan?<eos> We have someone here I think you're gonna want to see.<eos> James?
This whole fucking thing is insane.<eos> Crazy?<eos> Oh, you wanna know crazy?<eos> You remember my platonic friend, Barb?<eos> Oh, Barb!
Well, it's working for you.<eos> Hey, listen! Are we, uh... Am I ever going to see you again?<eos> Well, I don't know.<eos> I guess if you're, like, in New York, we could get a drink.<eos> In your wet dreams, motherfucker.
Very rude!<eos> Here we go. Moving in hot.<eos> This is what we trained for.<eos> You, on the roof.<eos> You, on the roof.
Here we go. Moving in hot.<eos> This is what we trained for.<eos> You, on the roof.<eos> You, on the roof.<eos> You, also on the roof.

Everyone on the roof.<eos> I know you're scared...<eos> Again, shut the fuck up, man!<eos> Jeffrey. What?<eos> Mama...
What? Oh!<eos> Here! I made them come here to get you.<eos> I missed you!<eos> I missed you, too!<eos> Hey. Agent Russell.
I missed you!<eos> I missed you, too!<eos> Hey. Agent Russell.<eos> Let me take that from you.<eos> Good job with morgado.
We've been looking for him for a while.<eos> Oh, my god. He's so mean.<eos> Anyway, your brother really cares about you.<eos> He's a real bummer.<eos> Oh, yeah. The worst.
Anyway, your brother really cares about you.<eos> He's a real bummer.<eos> Oh, yeah. The worst.<eos> Yep. Awful. Full agreement.<eos> Morgan. Morgan!
I'm so hungry. I'm so hungry.<eos> Let's get the fuck out of here!<eos> Can I have just whatever everyone is drinking?<eos> Just, like, your signature thing.<eos> Hi.
Okay, so anyway, I met this fascinating woman over there.<eos> And she's gonna take us to her home and she's gonna teach us how to make murtabak.<eos> What is that?<eos> It's a stuffed pancake.<eos> Awesome!
I don't know. Some old town like a million others.<eos> I swear I've been here before.<eos> This place?<eos> No. All these old towns look the same.<eos> Oh, like this place?
Where'd you get that?<eos> Front desk runs little concessions.<eos> Strictly on the downlow.<eos> And those are?<eos> Southwest shot glasses.
Southwest shot glasses.<eos> But didn't you leave lunch by the side of the road?<eos> It's old news.<eos> I think it was just a passing thing.<eos> - Cheers.
But didn't you leave lunch by the side of the road?<eos> It's old news.<eos> I think it was just a passing thing.<eos> - Cheers.<eos> So now what?
- Truth or dare?<eos> - Sure. Like, the meanest, most rotten, horrible, dirtiest, dishonorable, despicable thing that you've ever done.<eos> I took the five finger discount on these back in Santa fe.<eos> Is that not what you meant?<eos> - What about you?

It's a road that's not to be chosen by its even-ness, by its length.<eos> It's a road that's chosen by virtue of its destination.<eos> Of where we're going.<eos> Of where we're all going.<eos> Scarlett?
You were looking up at our room.<eos> Hey, let's shake a tail.<eos> La is not gonna drive to us.<eos> How are you not hung over?<eos> Desrt air?
Everything that you thought was rued shall recede!<eos> We shall be rassled down!<eos> The walls that keep you, the woman beside you...<eos> God, it's beautiful.<eos> Scarlett.
We shall be rassled down!<eos> The walls that keep you, the woman beside you...<eos> God, it's beautiful.<eos> Scarlett.<eos> - Scarlett? - Ah!
God, it's beautiful.<eos> Scarlett.<eos> - Scarlett? - Ah!<eos> - Can you turn around?<eos> - What?
I think we just have to go back.<eos> What? Let's make it to the next town.<eos> No, the further away I get, the worse it gets.<eos> - Further...<eos> Shit.
You should just go.<eos> Go downstairs, have a beer.<eos> Go on, go. I need to sleep.<eos> I don't feel good.<eos> El rancho?
El rancho?<eos> Hang on a second.<eos> It's for you.<eos> Hello?<eos> Alex.
Hang on a second.<eos> It's for you.<eos> Hello?<eos> Alex.<eos> Alex.
It's for you.<eos> Hello?<eos> Alex.<eos> Alex.<eos> Scarlett?
I think I know him.<eos> Who?<eos> The guy on TV?<eos> I know how it sounds.<eos> Scarlett.
Scarlett.<eos> I think he's trying to tell me something.<eos> Something important.<eos> Jesus, I forgive my children...<eos> Alex...
I just feel like I know this town.<eos> So let's just go. Let's get out of here.<eos> We'll be in la by morning.<eos> Ok.<eos> - Scarlett?
So let's just go. Let's get out of here.<eos> We'll be in la by morning.<eos> Ok.<eos> - Scarlett?<eos> - Oh, Alex.
We'll be in la by morning.<eos> Ok.<eos> - Scarlett?<eos> - Oh, Alex.<eos> Oh, my head.
- Scarlett?<eos> - Oh, Alex.<eos> Oh, my head.<eos> It feels like it's going to explode.<eos> Scarlett, just...
Front desk, can I help you?<eos> Hello. I wanted to see if I had any messages.<eos> Hello? Hello?<eos> Hello?<eos> Scarlett?
Just a man, Alex.<eos> What do you want? Tell me.<eos> Let's start with you telling me your particulars.<eos> - What does she look like?<eos> - What?
I tell you what, why don't we go for a little drive?<eos> Are you starting to feel it then?<eos> You're taking me to Scarlett.<eos> That's where you're taking me, isn't it?<eos> Hey! Schilter!
Let's hear some of that good old spiritual music.<eos> They sure don't make songs like they used to.<eos> It's louder because they know we're here.<eos> All this time and they never give up.<eos> Who?
And I throw her in the hole and I bury her.<eos> I bury her alive and she never ever dies.<eos> She lives for all eternity under a heavy darkness of dirt, reaping what she sowed.<eos> - This is impossible.<eos> - Impossible?
- Impossible?<eos> Just ask them.<eos> They all have a story.<eos> Hundreds of them.<eos> Thousands.
Well, if I say it's a church then it's a church.<eos> If I say I speak to god then there is a god that is spoken to.<eos> There was a man.<eos> Dirty hands, rings.<eos> This smile.
It's a mememto.<eos> It's all I have left of her,<eos> - so mind how you handle it.<eos> - Is she here?<eos> Scarlett? Scarlett?
I don't say I don't deserve it, though.<eos> It's true I knocked her around a time or two.<eos> But...<eos> My tiddling is strictly medicinal now, you understand.<eos> Bingo.
Tell me what this is.<eos> - It's murder, if you do this. - No!<eos> Tell me what this is!<eos> God damnit, I don't know!<eos> Ow, fuck!
You said this is all a dream.<eos> Yes, it is all a dream.<eos> But you ain't dreaming nothing.<eos> Scarlett is.<eos> Hey.
I have to go buy Isabella a gift and then I have to go get a manicure and pedicure.<eos> But they messed up the appointment so I'm supposed to go there for 4:30 but...<eos> That's it.<eos> Get that, hon?<eos> Hey.
The deal we've been putting together for the last four fucking months.<eos> What's going on here, Alex?<eos> Paige, is he ok?<eos> Hey, come on, man, I was just trying...<eos> Alex?
Do I look familiar to you at all?<eos> Couldn't say.<eos> All you young people look alike.<eos> - I might have been with a girl.<eos> - Pretty one?
Come on now, get up.<eos> I won't say it again.<eos> Now, you can't do that.<eos> This is not a campsite.<eos> Fine.
Just tell me where it is.<eos> - You just get on out of here. - I'm going.<eos> - Just tell me where it went.<eos> - Where what went?<eos> The church.
- I've got to be nothing.<eos> People tend to focus on the world around them, rather than the world within them.<eos> Now, you just drive on out of here.<eos> Ok.<eos> Alex?
Now, if, say I was dreaming...<eos> I know how that sounds, but let's just say I was dreaming.<eos> Do you really think that my mind would take the time to put a rotten pea in there? I mean, think about it.<eos> When you think about a pea, what do you think of?<eos> A fresh pea, right? A normal pea.
Do you really think the part of you that dreams is gonna put a rotten pea in a can?<eos> Don't answer that.<eos> If I was in a dream, why would that one bad pea be in there?<eos> I'm gonna go to bed.<eos> Paige?
Don't answer that.<eos> If I was in a dream, why would that one bad pea be in there?<eos> I'm gonna go to bed.<eos> Paige?<eos> Alex?
If I was in a dream, why would that one bad pea be in there?<eos> I'm gonna go to bed.<eos> Paige?<eos> Alex?<eos> Alex.
I don't know.<eos> Are you ok?<eos> Are you ok?<eos> - No.<eos> - Alex.
Ok, you need this.<eos> This is your home.<eos> I love you.<eos> And you love me.<eos> Paige?
- You came here to rape me.<eos> I know what you want.<eos> You can say her name if you want to.<eos> You want to... Call out her name?<eos> Scarlett.
I can be Scarlett if you want me to be Scarlett.<eos> No. No.<eos> No, you can't leave.<eos> You're not going anywhere!<eos> Fuck.
How can I remember the dirt falling in on me?<eos> You dropped him... me. Into the hole.<eos> Until there was only my face and my fingertips.<eos> And then the rain came, pellets of it.<eos> Bullet-sized.
And they would never know that you could never die<eos> - enough for me. - Shut up!<eos> " I know now I must be accountable" for my unspeakable actions.<eos> "And don't worry, just death comes to all things."<eos> "Flesh, blood, bone..."
Are all just temporal.<eos> "Rock lasts forever."<eos> "Which is where my spirit will reside."<eos> "I love you.<eos> Scarlett."
"Rock lasts forever."<eos> "Which is where my spirit will reside."<eos> "I love you.<eos> Scarlett."<eos> Alex.
ENGLAND, TODAY.<eos> What the hell is this?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Bloody hell.
What do you think you are doing?<eos> Evacuate your men.<eos> We'll take it from here.<eos> Who the hell are you people?<eos> This way, sir.
The past cannot remain buried forever.<eos> In my lifetime, I have unearth many ancient mysteries.<eos> At last, this tomb reveals antiquities darkest secret.<eos> A secret erased from history and forgotten to time.<eos> Princess Ahmanet.
But Pharaoh had a son.<eos> The boy now, would inherit her destiny.<eos> And Ahmanet understood power was not given it had to be taken.<eos> Vowing revenge she made a choice to embrace evil.<eos> Seth.
Sarge, you are not going down there.<eos> You're right.<eos> I'm not. We are.<eos> - At least call in an air strike.<eos> - Air Strike?
You're right.<eos> I'm not. We are.<eos> - At least call in an air strike.<eos> - Air Strike?<eos> Bad idea.
- Right.<eos> - Right.<eos> But we don't even know what's down there.<eos> Haram. Haram is what's down there.<eos> Treasure.
But we don't even know what's down there.<eos> Haram. Haram is what's down there.<eos> Treasure.<eos> No, the translator said "Haram" means "forbidden knowledge".<eos> Like a curse.
Well.. now he is gonna have to pay double.<eos> - Mount up.<eos> - "No, sir, I ain't going on this one."<eos> - What? - I'm not going.<eos> Vail.
- What? - I'm not going.<eos> Vail.<eos> What are you going to do?<eos> Oh no no no no.. No!<eos> You crazy bastard.

Wait for Delta team to respond or go in alone.<eos> It was Sergeant Morton's idea to go in actually!<eos> Only to find out that the villagers had long since evacuated.<eos> Yeah lucky for them, not for us.<eos> Delta, south side perimeter.
Where is it?<eos> What?<eos> Where is what?<eos> The letter. The map you stole from me.<eos> Map?
- .. and I did not want to wake her.<eos> - Ok. And the reward for my gracious consideration?<eos> Well Sir, as you can see "Hell hath no fury".<eos> - Sir.<eos> - Oh my God!
Get in the damn hole, Vail!<eos> Oh man!<eos> I am in a large antechamber of some kind.<eos> There is an inscription on the northern wall.<eos> The litany of Ra.
I am in a large antechamber of some kind.<eos> There is an inscription on the northern wall.<eos> The litany of Ra.<eos> ..kidding me?<eos> Your fault, Nick. Your fault.
There is mercury dripping from the ceiling into holes in the ground.<eos> Possibly to connect the..<eos> It's a canal system leading all the way to...<eos> Get the lights!<eos> Oh my God.
To keep people out.<eos> There isn't a single provision made for someone's journey into the underworld.<eos> No Canopic jars, no Shabtis.<eos> To be buried in a place like this would have been a fate worse than death.<eos> Nick!
We're leaving right now.<eos> I have not come this far just to leave without...<eos> Hey! Hey!<eos> Cease fire!<eos> Vail!
Please, Nick!<eos> Can we please, leave?<eos> YOU HAVE SET ME FREE.<eos> MY CHOSEN.<eos> Nick!

- Along with his child.<eos> She made some sort of pact with the God of death.<eos> And then, when I saw those birds and that sandstorm...<eos> Whatever I mean something is happening. You are alive I do not know how.<eos> You...
You walked into the chicks bathroom by the way.<eos> Go to your own bathroom! Yes, it's the ladies room.<eos> What do you mean I'm cursed?<eos> How do you think you survived the crash?<eos> "Setapai".
How do you think you survived the crash?<eos> "Setapai".<eos> You know what it means.<eos> She's got plans for you, Nick.<eos> Plans?
- We angered the Gods.<eos> - Wait.. what?<eos> I saw her.. the chick in the box.<eos> - Ahmanet?<eos> - That one.
- He said I'm cursed.<eos> - Who said?<eos> - Vail. - Vail?<eos> - The coffin we found.<eos> - Sarcophagus.
What? No!<eos> You heard it.. you forgot it.. Why are you backing off from this?<eos> I'm telling you.<eos> She is real.<eos> Nick.
Nick.. what is it?<eos> I think you're right.<eos> I.. This is all in my head.<eos> Can't you find the box, look inside ...and when I see a 3,000 years old prune in there...<eos> - Nick.

My name is Jekyll.<eos> Dr. Henry Jekyll.<eos> There you are.<eos> This days, I specialize in immunology, perhaps.<eos> Infectious diseases perhaps.
This days, I specialize in immunology, perhaps.<eos> Infectious diseases perhaps.<eos> I would like to, If I may, Mr. Morton to tell you a story.<eos> A story about a patient of mine.<eos> A man of promise.
The world will fall to your desire.<eos> You will have power of life over death.<eos> And you will have me. I will be your queen.<eos> Just give in.<eos> Nick.
Evil has many names, Mr. Morton.<eos> Take Seth, for example.<eos> Known to Egyptians as the God of death.<eos> In the Old Testament: Satan, Lucifer.<eos> - The Devil.
When one is dealing with the salvation of humanity certain sacrifices must be made.<eos> Excuse me, sir.<eos> They found it.<eos> What found.. what?<eos> Henry.
What found.. what?<eos> Henry.<eos> Are you planning on killing him?<eos> Kill him?<eos> - Jennifer...
- Kill who?<eos> Mr. Morton here essentially killed himself when he severed the barrier chain that had kept Ahmanet power imprisoned for 5,000 years.<eos> He was chosen as her ideal candidate.<eos> A thief, physically capable, compulsively devious and utterly devoid of soul.<eos> - What?

Oh my dear Henry Jekyll if ever I've seen Satan signature upon a face is on that of your new friend.<eos> Hey, hey hey! Take it!<eos> Now!<eos> - Run, Mr. Morton.<eos> - What?
Now!<eos> - Run, Mr. Morton.<eos> - What?<eos> Run!<eos> Nick!
They won't let me out, Nicholas.<eos> They never do.<eos> Woah woah what's happening?<eos> Did you just shut down the mercury?<eos> Pete?
It's not me that wants to kill you, it's Henry.<eos> I have something more collaborative in mind.<eos> I'm offering you a partnership.<eos> You, evil incarnate.<eos> Me, your good friend, Eddie Hyde.
I'm offering you a partnership.<eos> You, evil incarnate.<eos> Me, your good friend, Eddie Hyde.<eos> Think about it.<eos> Jenny!
She's out!<eos> She has the dagger.<eos> We thinks she is coming to you, so are we.<eos> Lock your doors and secure that stone.<eos> Nick!
This is the moment!<eos> Yes, you are damn right.<eos> I'm gonna taking that stone, Deliver you to Ahmanet and then my work here is done.<eos> What?<eos> Nick?
Yes, you are damn right.<eos> I'm gonna taking that stone, Deliver you to Ahmanet and then my work here is done.<eos> What?<eos> Nick?<eos> Jenny?
Ahmanet is never going to let her live.<eos> You can't save her.<eos> ARISE, MY WARRIORS, AND SERVE ME.<eos> No! Oh no!<eos> Nick?
You can't save her.<eos> ARISE, MY WARRIORS, AND SERVE ME.<eos> No! Oh no!<eos> Nick?<eos> Nick?
ARISE, MY WARRIORS, AND SERVE ME.<eos> No! Oh no!<eos> Nick?<eos> Nick?<eos> Nick?
We are gonna figure this out.. I need you to just stay with me.<eos> Just stay with me.<eos> We'll think of something.<eos> No!<eos> Jenny!
Just stay with me.<eos> We'll think of something.<eos> No!<eos> Jenny!<eos> Jenny!
Jenny!<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> Let go!<eos> Jenny!
Somewhere in there I know you're a good man.<eos> The world needs a cure.<eos> You can be that cure.<eos> A sacrifice for the greater good!<eos> Jenny.

Wake up.<eos> Wake up.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry, Jenny.<eos> Jenny.
Jenny, please wake up.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I do not know what I'm doing.<eos> Please wake up.<eos> Jenny.
Jenny.<eos> Wake up, please.<eos> Just...<eos> Jenny, just wake up!<eos> Nick?
Wake up, please.<eos> Just...<eos> Jenny, just wake up!<eos> Nick?<eos> Nick!
Just...<eos> Jenny, just wake up!<eos> Nick?<eos> Nick!<eos> Nick.
Jenny, just wake up!<eos> Nick?<eos> Nick!<eos> Nick.<eos> Nick?
I don't want to hurt you, Jenny.<eos> You are alive.<eos> You are alive.<eos> I'm so glad you're alive.<eos> Oh Nick.
You are alive.<eos> I'm so glad you're alive.<eos> Oh Nick.<eos> You did this for me?<eos> Yes.
We didn't see this coming, did we?<eos> They are coming for me.<eos> I wish we had more time.<eos> I'll find you.<eos> Goodbye, Jenny.
Goodbye, Jenny.<eos> You were wrong about Nick.<eos> He gave his life to save me.<eos> To bring me back.<eos> Yes, Jennifer.
A good man.<eos> Perhaps.<eos> Yet it has only begun to discover his power.<eos> And we cannot know which side will win out.<eos> Between Darkness and light good or evil.

The same pattern is repeating around the world, so there could be an overriding factor.<eos> Perhaps a paranormal element.<eos> Are you talking about magic?<eos> We've come up against magic before, Batman.<eos> - Xerxes, Trigon, Felix Faust.
I recommend spending more time on the streets instead of flying over them.<eos> He's even friendlier than they say.<eos> Bollocks!<eos> In what bloody plane of existence does four of a kind lose?<eos> Too, too bad, Constantine.
Let's play, shall we?<eos> My luck's running as hot as me naughty bits.<eos> But our next group of friends is due to arrive, so it's time to bust you out.<eos> Copperfield's coming. Presto changeo!<eos> Woman in a box.
I'll tell you on the way to John's.<eos> Okay, but I call shotgun.<eos> I don't even think his kid could fit back here.<eos> Sorry, Boston, but life is for the living.<eos> Boston Brand.
It's the magic of the House.<eos> Decided it wanted to experience humanity and gave itself a body.<eos> It sure did.<eos> A spirit whose existence is not its own, like myself.<eos> Interesting.
Okay, if we do it as a group.<eos> This is the monkey cage in Sumatra all over again.<eos> "We need to save the monkeys," she said.<eos> - You're such an ass.<eos> - Not the monkeys.
This one has cheated us many times.<eos> It is vexing.<eos> This has been lovely, but it's time for you lot to bugger off.<eos> When the time comes, I'll be the one to collect your soul, Constantine.<eos> Yeah, yeah.
How you doing, Johnny boy?<eos> Zatanna and Batman?<eos> What the hell?<eos> Tell you everything inside, mate.<eos> You poor thing.
Just like everything, this is rock star Johnny's fault.<eos> I was with you when it happened, Ritchie. We were side by side.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah, side by side. But I got the weird magical cancer while you, you added to your rep. Isn't that right?<eos> Look, me not making proper amends isn't related to the Key, which, truth be told, you're not gonna need, mate.<eos> John!
Well, doctors say an upbeat attitude can help, so what I'll focus on today is that I met Batman. Force of good.<eos> It was also nice seeing you, Zatanna.<eos> Now, if you'll excuse me...<eos> You can show yourselves out.<eos> This him?
Wrong. I expect the worst, so I prepare for the worst, and when the worst happens, I'm ready.<eos> But my outlook doesn't alter the reality of the world.<eos> - Steven, stop!<eos> - Leave me alone!<eos> Another precious moment.
This was the morning of his madness.<eos> - What do you think will set him off?<eos> - My guess is the Sudoku.<eos> He's got two 9s in the same row.<eos> John.
- Me, neither.<eos> But if there's a person alive who can, it's Ritchie.<eos> Are you forgetting when you made your friend despise you?<eos> This is too bloody important for hurt feelings.<eos> - Constantine.

Which is why it stays here, where only I can get to it.<eos> I think me, them, and everyone else who knows you might want it to be somewhere else.<eos> Your friend is awake.<eos> Ritchie, who was it? Who did this to you?<eos> Faust.

Yeah, wizards don't make a habit of signing up for credit cards or social media.<eos> His grandly named Observatory of the Cosmos is hidden from the likes of you and Superman, but not from me.<eos> - What's happening? - If this were a computer,<eos> I'd say it's frozen.<eos> Cheers.
Cheers.<eos> Felix Faust would take precautions against locator spells.<eos> There's another way, but it involves asking a favor of someone that I don't have the best relationship with.<eos> Someone else dislikes you?<eos> Shocking.

It's a favorite hidey hole of one Alec Holland, whose corpse was taken to be the most recent Avatar of the Green.<eos> Bet you won't find that on your bloody cell phone.<eos> Our data's more factual.<eos> Alec Holland was murdered by terrorists. His body was never recovered.<eos> End of story.
Not quite.<eos> Go away!<eos> Swamp Thing! I know you're seeing this.<eos> Get out here, or the posies get it!<eos> John Constantine.
Stored magic?<eos> Really?<eos> It's the TV dinner of spell casting, dear.<eos> Here's what real magic looks like.<eos> Z!
You can't.<eos> Out of my way, John.<eos> If no blood is spilled, your soul is in the clear.<eos> Get control, Z, just like I taught you.<eos> Easy-peasy, lemon squeezy.
We were sent here by your friend, remember?<eos> - But Ritchie's dying.<eos> - Is he?<eos> Boy, boy. I think I got closer to death than I planned.<eos> Bad girl.
He'll have this city by midnight, the Eastern Seaboard by dawn.<eos> Then, what's to stop him?<eos> He'll be a god.<eos> We don't need another one of those mucking about.<eos> All right.
They're everywhere! Everywhere!<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> My will be done.<eos> Fool!
At least you're asking.<eos> Gone, gone, the form of man.<eos> Rise the demon Etrigan!<eos> So Constantine calls once more.<eos> Just like a greedy, wanton...
- Calling for help.<eos> I just hope he doesn't realize it's me doing the calling.<eos> Who dares strike at me?<eos> The Defender of the Green...<eos> Swamp Thing.
I'm truly sorry, Jason.<eos> Don't be.<eos> It's a welcome end.<eos> For 500 years, he and I have been bound.<eos> A demon from hell, a knight of renown.
Listening to me now?<eos> They want you, too.<eos> Good one, Z. Too right, they do.<eos> You have got to be bloody kidding.<eos> No way.
Now, hold on. Hold on.<eos> Maybe I've been a bit rash.<eos> Could you tell me more over a drink?<eos> We could rechristen the House, as it were.<eos> - A drink?
In the guest lounge.<eos> We are ready to meet you now.<eos> I see overdrafts On your current account.<eos> It seems that no deposits have been made. A few months ago.<eos> "Waxler" for mining.
"Waxler" for mining.<eos> Yes, I have been phoning them for weeks.<eos> I did not get a satisfactory answer.<eos> What about this foreclosure warning?<eos> Yellow warning.
We must clarify the possibility of this happening When refinancing.<eos> - You did it.<eos> - I did what?<eos> You sold me this nonsense.<eos> "Joe Harding".
Ladies and gentlemen, Thank you for your attention.<eos> We came for a withdrawal.<eos> Excluding cashiers, We would like to lie down on your back, And lift up your arms and your feet In the air like cats.<eos> Let everyone land!<eos> Camera 5.
Dear Sir, It is worth your while to remain silent.<eos> I suffer from muscle spasm.<eos> Please relax, you can sit down.<eos> No!<eos> Not you!
I suffer from muscle spasm.<eos> Please relax, you can sit down.<eos> No!<eos> Not you!<eos> In the position of the cat!
There is not much in it, but it's all yours.<eos> No my friend, not you.<eos> It is the duty of society to care for the elderly.<eos> This "Chuck" never cared.<eos> "Chuck".
Crime is not wonderful, my love.<eos> He could have been shot.<eos> Or worse.<eos> What is worse than being shot?<eos> Exposure to two rounds of fire.
Police draw for tattoo<eos> I hit it!<eos> "The three men left With about $ 1.6 million."<eos> Three hooded robbers steal 1.6 million.<eos> "FBI and police 'New York'."
"The three men left With about $ 1.6 million."<eos> Three hooded robbers steal 1.6 million.<eos> "FBI and police 'New York'."<eos> "They say they have no evidence right now."<eos> and what?
Like a dance.<eos> Yes, the "Kunga" dance is immediately immersed in them In prison.<eos> Will we play or what?<eos> Ask the responsible man.<eos> Milton?

Milton?<eos> Milton!<eos> Who will play in the second arena?<eos> Yeah.<eos> "J52".
Not yet, but we'll discover what's going on.<eos> I need pension money.<eos> Yes, we are all this man.<eos> I have something very important to say.<eos> "J52".
Are you kidding?<eos> Hey guys, I understand it's tough news.<eos> I can not address you Unless you are calm.<eos> Excuse me, Mr. Lewis.<eos> Welcome Joe.
It's right.<eos> We must take our share of the pie And we eat it.<eos> We have at least achieved this.<eos> Good evening, sir.<eos> Good evening.
I accepted them all, and used her tongue.<eos> I did it with all the crew, It's a mobile sex infection!<eos> This week and the events that have passed. Makes my decision seem impossible.<eos> "Kaitlin," I shut your mouth.<eos> "Nick".
It was a fantastic meal tonight.<eos> It is impressive What you can do with frozen fish.<eos> The best garlic bread I've ever eaten.<eos> And the mix of red pepper and garlic!<eos> - Awesome!
