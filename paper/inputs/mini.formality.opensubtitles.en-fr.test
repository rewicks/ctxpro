Got it. 43rd floor.<eos> Someone's contacted the president's staff.<eos> Someone's watching him.<eos> Dr. Osmond, what is it you want from us?<eos> I think it's more about what Hanka Robotics can do for you.
I can see everything.<eos> All of your thoughts, your... decisions.<eos> - I guess privacy is just for humans.<eos> - You are human.<eos> People see you as human.
I'm gonna have to draw some attention.<eos> See if I can access the basement that way.<eos> You're not here looking for any trouble, are you?<eos> I'm just here for the girls... and beer.<eos> - Can I help you?
Your friend.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> Batou.<eos> Can you hear me?<eos> Who did this stunning work on you?
My name is Lee Cunningham.<eos> - Where'd you get the weapons?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Who loaded the ...?<eos> I don't know anything about the weapons, alright I told you.
What are you doing to me?<eos> I have, connected you, to a network of my own creation.<eos> W-w-when I'm finished in this world... my ghost can survive there and regenerate.<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> I became... fascinated with you.
No, I didn't kill anyone.<eos> You wouldn't be here.<eos> You wouldn't exist if it weren't for those experiments.<eos> Experiments?<eos> - Is that what I am to you?
You know what he told me.<eos> The truth.<eos> You're deleting everything, aren't you?<eos> No.<eos> Make it so I don't remember... you.
I'll take that under advisement.<eos> So what now?<eos> Oh, the poor pumpkin!<eos> Oh, you surprised me.<eos> She likes you.
She was... fearless.<eos> And wild.<eos> You remind me of her.<eos> Sorry.<eos> How do I remind you of her?
We must have over 100 redundancies in place to prevent some punk with a laptop from hijacking satellites.<eos> And Pandora's Box can bypass all of them.<eos> With the push of a button, it can eavesdrop on secure communications,<eos> corrupt military software, transmit false intelligence, or crash a satellite out of the sky like a goddamn tactical warhead.<eos> One of you is behind this.
The President gave him a medal.<eos> That must have been pretty cool, right?<eos> You guys must have some seriously cool stories to tell.<eos> Must've seen a lot.<eos> I wonder, how many of you have ever pulled a freestyle triple backflip on a BMX bike before?
In a new video released just moments ago, an anonymous group is claiming to have the ability to use satellites as weapons.<eos> They claim "that the violation of civil liberties<eos> "of all the citizens of the world<eos> "is an atrocity that must be stopped."<eos> Disable and dismantle all the world's spy programs within the next 24 hours, or I'll do it for you, one satellite at a time.
Easy.<eos> X, keep Chatty Cathy talking.<eos> I still don't have a shot.<eos> We made it that way.<eos> People like Gibbons and the two of you.
Well?<eos> Serena.<eos> We're a bit busy now!<eos> Marke's got Pandora's Box.<eos> She's gonna drop a satellite on top of you.
It's a local crime committed by locals against locals.<eos> Shit, as I'm sure you're aware, one of the guys involved is my own goddamn brother.<eos> In high school, we all played on the same football team.<eos> We all know each other, so.<eos> I assure you, if anybody's capable of catching these guys, catching them before there's any further bloodshed, it's gonna be my partner and I.
Sounds like we're gonna get along just fine.<eos> Reed Ethington, I'd like you to meet the two gentlemen our government has sent down here to assist us in our hour of need.<eos> So, let's head over to Morrow's place.<eos> If any of 'em are dumb enough to head home, it'd have to be Chris.<eos> We'll follow you.
Where the fuck is Ed?<eos> - Ed's keeping a low profile.<eos> There's way too much heat on him to risk being seen.<eos> All right, where's my tape?<eos> We'll give it to you when we come pick up the bag.
You've got a lot of nerve blackmailing me twice with the same tape.<eos> Yeah, I don't know. It just kinda felt like a two-chit tape.<eos> You know, now, especially. I hear you're running for the Senate.<eos> Burton, if you ever show up flaunting this tape in my face again, I swear to God, I'm gonna.<eos> Relax, hombre, you think I'm gonna care, when I'm drinking piña coladas on some deserted playa, about you and your 19-year-old fucking butt-buddy?
Tells me you got something brewing up here.<eos> Sorry, do I know you?<eos> Do you mind if I say something else?<eos> I'm gonna say something else.<eos> Nobody deserves a full minute of your attention unless they're giving it back to you.
She's just my tablemate today.<eos> Can I ask what her name is?<eos> Megan-Ann.<eos> There it is.<eos> I may come to you one day asking for Megan-Ann's hand in marriage.
- He's a what?<eos> - A knobhead.<eos> Like a dickhead.<eos> I'm Donny Haczyk.<eos> Good to see you again, Donny.
You know, this isn't really dancing.<eos> This is dancing.<eos> Watch it!<eos> What?<eos> It was lovely to dance with you.
So, yeah, in honor of that I've got a few things I'd like to say about love.<eos> This friend cf mine, Clarence, once stood up during lunch period and said he had something to say about love.<eos> Then he took a dump on the table.<eos> When Francie first met Doug, she just always knew that he'd never let her down.<eos> But I thought people almost always let you down, so where did that come from?
She's none of our business.<eos> Who knows what that girl will do to herself?<eos> We don't, because we don't know anything about her.<eos> She's temperamental. She hasn't had a drink and now she's puked up mini hotdogs.<eos> Do none of you care that that girl is obviously pregnant?
I'm not actually a successful businessman.<eos> I was in prison because I stole $125,000 from the father of the bride.<eos> It was not a table of honor.<eos> I have a bag of dope in my room.<eos> Room 115 for the dope in case any of you feel that a bag of dope would be fun to do.
Yeah.<eos> My mom says your fries are better than the ones in all of my dad's diners.<eos> Well, that's not what I thought I'd leave with here today, but it's something, so thank you.<eos> Sure.<eos> We hope it all works out for you.
So, that's it.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I don't know how you fixed this, but it really meant a lot.<eos> Well, it's been so great to catch up with you all.
I cried so hard Teddy gave me his.<eos> He was always good like that.<eos> Francie, we should go. Okay.<eos> Thanks again for coming, everyone.<eos> It wouldn't have been the same without you.
I just took my pills.<eos> You know what, you can have grandma's potatoes.<eos> I don't want hers.<eos> Tyler, knock it off.<eos> Okay, egg white omelet for you.
Primary custody?<eos> Well, he can't have that.<eos> I mean, can he?<eos> My batteries are gonna die, Mr. Jackson.<eos> If it does, I'll call you back, okay?
- So this pursuit has ended.<eos> - No!<eos> No, that is the wrong minivan!<eos> Shit!<eos> Okay, so... So even if they are not looking for you... They are looking for me.
No, that is the wrong minivan!<eos> Shit!<eos> Okay, so... So even if they are not looking for you... They are looking for me.<eos> They are looking to find me.<eos> And when they do I am gonna be right behind you.
Okay, so... So even if they are not looking for you... They are looking for me.<eos> They are looking to find me.<eos> And when they do I am gonna be right behind you.<eos> If I lose you... I know what's your car looks like.<eos> And I know there had to be some mom at that park who got a picture of you.
If I lose you... I know what's your car looks like.<eos> And I know there had to be some mom at that park who got a picture of you.<eos> They saw you.<eos> And you ran a bunch of red lights at that park too. And there are red light camera all over the place.<eos> And I know they would've got you too.
- Frankie.<eos> Karla, unlock the door.<eos> What do you want?<eos> You got $10,000?<eos> I'm gonna ride with you, your son is gonna ride with him and we're gonna go get that money.
- They'll be here in a minute.<eos> Can't wait!<eos> There's a police station up the road right in town!<eos> My son has been kidnapped.<eos> Has anybody contacted you?
A six years old African-American boy.<eos> Last seen wearing a blue and red shirt.<eos> Responds to Frankie Dyson.<eos> The mother is here with me at the station.<eos> Do you have a cellphone that I can use so if I go out there I can call and stay in touch with you?
I've put out an APP for Jefferson Parish.<eos> You just need to wait, Karla.<eos> You've reach David Dyson.<eos> I'm away from my desk right now.<eos> I'll get back to you as soon as possible.
911 operator, what's your emergency?<eos> I need help.<eos> Ma'am?<eos> Ma'am, are you there? Ma'am?<eos> Ma'am, we're here with you.
Ma'am, are you there? Ma'am?<eos> Ma'am, we're here with you.<eos> We're keeping the line open, we're gonna get you some help.<eos> Do not hang up.<eos> I'm gonna place you on hold while we triangulate your location.
Ma'am, we're here with you.<eos> We're keeping the line open, we're gonna get you some help.<eos> Do not hang up.<eos> I'm gonna place you on hold while we triangulate your location.<eos> I'll be right back with you.
Yeah, they're up there in that hole.<eos> Dear Lord.<eos> We have to get them down.<eos> Hey, you two.<eos> We're gonna get you down from there right now.
Because I'm a woman.<eos> So I came to America, the Land of Opportunity, because everything is fair here.<eos> But who's to say anymore?<eos> I have a point to prove, Councilman.<eos> And I'm here to create an opportunity for you.
Hey, look out!<eos> Lady, get out of the way!<eos> - My kids!<eos> - Ma'am, everything's okay.<eos> I'm here to save you.
I'm here to save you.<eos> My name is Matt Brody.<eos> - Somebody help!<eos> - Ma'am, stop it!<eos> I can't save you if you're being a dick!
You're okay.<eos> Come on.<eos> Breathe for me.<eos> Come on, big man.<eos> We'll set you down right here.
Hot Wheels, I'll see you back here in the morning.<eos> Sure thing, Lieutenant.<eos> Welcome to Baywatch.<eos> All right.<eos> Hey, I'm so glad I caught you all.
We're just doing our jobs.<eos> Hey, guys, this is Victoria Leeds, the new owner of the Huntley Club.<eos> - Hey. How you doing?<eos> - Hey.<eos> Well, I just wanted to invite all of you to the Huntley. We're having an open house.
But I'm working on it.<eos> Yeah, well, you just ran out of time.<eos> Leon, would you show Mr. Rodriguez what we do to people who don't deliver?<eos> I know you're dealing flakka, which is gonna drive down real estate prices in the bay, right? Right?<eos> So if anything happens to me, I will expose you.
I'm not a Bond villain.<eos> Well, yet.<eos> You're in politics.<eos> You know that no one can claw their way to the top without getting a little dirt under their fingernails.<eos> Clearly, I overestimated you.
- Yes.<eos> Fuck it.<eos> Mr. Chen, I'm so glad you could make it.<eos> I wanted to meet the new neighbor everyone is talking about.<eos> So I presume you know why I had to invite you.
Oh, God.<eos> Mitch, this is for you.<eos> Wait.<eos> No, Victoria.<eos> I have something very special planned for you, for everyone.
Hey.<eos> First date.<eos> You can't blame me, right?<eos> So juvenile.<eos> I'm onto you all.
Gone.<eos> Doesn't exist.<eos> They're bad guys and they don't want us to have it.<eos> Okay.<eos> Let me try to explain this to you in a way that you people can understand.
Just trying to figure out what the fuck was with "you people."<eos> All right, now, look.<eos> Leave law enforcement to the police.<eos> Okay?<eos> And you guys just do the jobs that I hired you to do.
I'm telling you. They're behind this.<eos> Mitch, it's Thorpe, your boss.<eos> Look, stop with the Huntley crap, okay?<eos> And don't even come down here.<eos> We don't need you.
Blatantly disregarding your jurisdiction?<eos> Sir, I only stepped away to check out the Huntley<eos> - and find the flakka.<eos> - I warned you.<eos> I warned you about sticking to your job.
- Mitch is gone.<eos> He's gone, so all we care about now is protecting the bay.<eos> And we know you feel the same.<eos> I do.<eos> I always knew I liked you two.
No, you just knocked his ass out.<eos> Thank God.<eos> Here's the key. Here's the key.<eos> All right, guys, Brody found the flakka.<eos> And let's get you out of here and call Ellerbee, okay?
As usual, I have to do everything myself.<eos> - Mitch!<eos> - Don't bother.<eos> He's dead.<eos> - Because of you.
Guys, after finding the drugs, helping save Chen and helping me blow up the bad girl with a Roman candle, it's a pleasure to say you are officially no longer trainees.<eos> - Congratulations.<eos> - Yeah, guys.<eos> Hey, guys, one more important thing.<eos> I want to introduce you to our new captain who has been running our Hawaii division very successfully for years now.
Maybe for you there's a tomorrow.
Maybe for you there's a tomorrow.<eos> Maybe for you there's 1,000 or 3,000 or 10.
Get this bitch on a leash!<eos> Psycho!<eos> Psycho. You wanna go?<eos> Go back to the ward, you psycho bitch!<eos> What do you think people will say about you when you die?
Right.<eos> Look, whatever.<eos> Really.<eos> I mean, this whole high school thing's just a blip.<eos> I'm not gonna remember any of you.
It's too late.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> It's never too late.<eos> Juliet, stop!<eos> Maybe for you there's a tomorrow.
No, it's not.<eos> It's never too late.<eos> Juliet, stop!<eos> Maybe for you there's a tomorrow.<eos> Maybe for you there's 1,000 or 3,000 or 10.
Oh, yes.<eos> And it's so nice and quiet out here in the suburbs.<eos> It sure is.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, we're happy to have you.
Well, we're happy to have you.<eos> Um, so, I've been meaning to say we're real impressed with your numbers this past year, Jim.<eos> Real impressed.<eos> You know, I'm glad you brought that up.<eos> I've actually been meaning to talk to you about that.
Real impressed.<eos> You know, I'm glad you brought that up.<eos> I've actually been meaning to talk to you about that.<eos> I was thinking, with the numbers so high, maybe it's time I get off the road and take an office position.<eos> Well, we really need you on the road.
Well, we really need you on the road.<eos> That's the backbone of the whole operation, really.<eos> I'll be honest, Jim.<eos> You are one of our best traveling salesmen.<eos> I mean, I would be crazy to take you out of the field.
Hey, no.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you both for the ride.
Okay.<eos> Check the back of the house!<eos> Somebody give me a hand.<eos> Go, go, go!<eos> We got you. Got her.
Somebody give me a hand.<eos> Go, go, go!<eos> We got you. Got her.<eos> We've got you.<eos> We've got you.
Ethan finally had what he needed.<eos> He was happy.<eos> I was happy, too.<eos> Excuse me, everybody.<eos> I would like to thank you all for coming here today.
Yes!<eos> So... how's business?<eos> Terrible.<eos> Everybody just does it themselves now.<eos> When I talked to you on the phone... I pictured some guy with an Army buddy on the force...
Like... way bigger than this place.<eos> That's great.<eos> And how did Claire's parents feel about you and Wilson making contact like that?<eos> Or was that their idea?<eos> They must really trust you to let her stay here for the weekend.
Wilson, she needs to leave.<eos> Wilson!<eos> What the hell are you doing here?<eos> I come in peace.<eos> I just wanted to talk to you and your wife.
I just wanted to talk to you and your wife.<eos> I'll get a restraining order if I have to.<eos> Please, I mean no harm.<eos> Just the opposite.<eos> I wanted a chance... to get to know you and Mrs. Cassiday a little.
Just the opposite.<eos> I wanted a chance... to get to know you and Mrs. Cassiday a little.<eos> I... I brought this for Claire.<eos> I thought she might be interested in her family tree, and there's photos.<eos> Yeah, well, we don't want you or your book.
I wanted a chance... to get to know you and Mrs. Cassiday a little.<eos> I... I brought this for Claire.<eos> I thought she might be interested in her family tree, and there's photos.<eos> Yeah, well, we don't want you or your book.<eos> I'm asking you. Go home.
Am I clear, brother?<eos> Now leave me.<eos> Peace?<eos> For a while.<eos> Have we arrived in time to save you from each other?
Are you sure about this, my Lord?<eos> Listen to me, woman. I need you to do as I tell you.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I need to get you and the boy away from here.<eos> And I'll join you as soon as I can.
For a man who's so popular, I'm surprised I don't.<eos> Goosefat Bill.<eos> I know who he is.<eos> He got that moniker 'cause he keeps slipping out from the bars you keep putting him behind.<eos> He was found in this establishment, and that doesn't look good for you.
What gave you such drive?<eos> So, what happens now?<eos> You know what happens now.<eos> You're quickly becoming a legend.<eos> Someone here to see you.
You're good with animals, aren't you?<eos> They have a word for that, don't they?<eos> "Mage."<eos> I thought your team was outlawed.<eos> Never met one of you in the flesh.
Between them, they can rustle up 12,000 warriors.<eos> In order to stand a chance, we are going to need at least some of their support.<eos> We can arrange a meeting with six of those families...<eos> Let me stop you there.<eos> If I may, allow me to run you through the proceedings as I think they will unfold.
- Open the doors.<eos> What a waste of brandy.<eos> But doesn't it make the palace burn well?<eos> 10,000 boys. All under 12 years.<eos> Young enough to forget their families, and to have no other loyalty than to you.
Let's go!<eos> - I'm holding you up.<eos> Go on without me.<eos> - No, Lack, come on.<eos> Let's go. - No, I'll see you at the safe house.
You wanted to know what gave me such drive?<eos> It was you.<eos> You put me in that brothel.<eos> You cut me on the streets.<eos> I am here now because of you.
You put me in that brothel.<eos> You cut me on the streets.<eos> I am here now because of you.<eos> You created me.<eos> And, for that, I bless you.
And once you finish it, how are you supposed to get to the middle?<eos> But how did you get it through the door?<eos> Did you carry it in?<eos> Or did you roll it in?<eos> May I remind you, a fleet of 3,000 longships controlling the seas, surrounding your island.
Mr. Downs, let's not get carried away.<eos> I guess you know what kind of man I am.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll get your stuff and I'll bring it right to you.
What are you doing?<eos> This is the men's room.<eos> Okay. Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> There was a guy banging around just like you in that one.
When you made me the offer, you were helping me out.<eos> But when I promised my father that I had it all covered, then you became obligated.<eos> So, where is my goddamn cocaine?<eos> Okay.<eos> Can you hold one moment, please? Thank you.
Now, Stanley, you never do.<eos> Looking for Mr. Rubino.<eos> I think that's them.<eos> We gotta go.<eos> I'll get you out of here.
What the fuck is going on, Vin?<eos> Listen.<eos> Everything I do is about you and him.<eos> You know it's always been that, right?<eos> I would never let anything bad happen to either of you.
I'm sorry I'm late.<eos> - No, it's okay. - All right.<eos> So, the Owens aren't interested.<eos> - You still wanna buy me lunch? - Of course.<eos> It's my way of keeping you motivated.
Really sorry.<eos> - No worries.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Just drop me wherever suits you.
Well, we are close to my place, and I got a guest room.<eos> You can use it for the night, have a hot shower.<eos> Look, don't feel like you owe me, okay?<eos> It's the least I can do.<eos> I would be at the hospital without you back there.
- You like it?<eos> - Yeah, I like it. Good.<eos> You must have sold a lot of books.<eos> - I did all right.<eos> - Hey, let me help you.
No.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> Probably working for my ex.<eos> Is that a joke?<eos> Let me show you to your room.
Because I can't afford to stay.<eos> You know, can't sell any of my work.<eos> Besides, there's nothing left for me here.<eos> Not without my wife.<eos> I can help you. No.
They liked me a lot, so you know, the word got around and suddenly, well, this American literary agent flew out to meet me in Madrid, and he said that the studios were interested to adapt, some of my books to the screen.<eos> And so, for all my sins I signed with him.<eos> So he sold the book, and they got me to write the screenplay and suddenly out of the blue you know, they forgot the agreement, entirely.<eos> And they gave it to somebody else to write.<eos> So they kicked you out of your own movie?
Maybe the truck driver should come back into the story towards the end.<eos> I have a better ending in mind.<eos> Hard to speak a single word, isn't it?<eos> That's where your script fails.<eos> That was the only way to show you.
Get back to work.<eos> Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me, fuck me.<eos> Fuck me.<eos> I mean, maybe you don't want me to be your real estate agent anymore but you asked me out.<eos> - I've been calling you for days.
- What's going on? Who?<eos> Give me the keys.<eos> Trust me. Get in.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - I'll explain to you later, I'm sorry.
Right.<eos> Paul.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Deputy Carcano. How can I help you?
Lander One, are you reading me?<eos> Roger that.<eos> That was one hell of a landing.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We're having some trouble reading you.
Okay.<eos> This will do.<eos> Expedition Team, do you read us?<eos> Mother's saying the ion storm is getting worse.<eos> We're having a hell of a time tracking you.
This is Expedition Party reporting.<eos> Do you read me?<eos> Tennessee?<eos> Tennessee, Ricks, come in.<eos> I'm not sure they'll hear you through the storm.
Some crossbreeding, hybridizing, what have you.<eos> You engineered these, David?<eos> Idle hands are the devil's workshop, Captain.<eos> Come.<eos> This is what I wanted to show you.
Waiting, really.<eos> For what?<eos> What are they waiting for, David?<eos> Mother.<eos> Perfectly safe, I assure you.
Remind me. What is that about... curiosity and the cat?<eos> Shaw didn't die in the crash.<eos> No.<eos> What did you do to her?<eos> Exactly what I'm going to do to you.
No.<eos> What did you do to her?<eos> Exactly what I'm going to do to you.<eos> That's the spirit.<eos> I can see why Walter thought so much of you.
Don't let the bedbugs bite.<eos> I'll tuck in the children.<eos> Use security code David 73694-B.<eos> Welcome.<eos> How may I help you?
One at a time. One at a time.<eos> Please. Please.<eos> - Smurfette sees this mystery Smurf.<eos> - We have to go to the Forbidden Forest.<eos> I've told you time and again, the Forbidden Forest is forbidden.
I've told you time and again, the Forbidden Forest is forbidden.<eos> And now you're talking about maps and mystery Smurfs and Gargamel's lair.<eos> None of this makes any sense, and I really don't understand why you can't follow simple rules.<eos> You snuck out and it put you all in danger.<eos> Seems to me the only way I can keep you safe is if...
No way!<eos> - But, Papa, but...<eos> - Come on!<eos> No "buts."<eos> None of you are to take one step out of your mushrooms without telling me where you're going.
It's too dangerous.<eos> I have to at least warn that lost village.<eos> Well, we're Team Smurf, and we stick together.<eos> So, we're coming with you.<eos> I can't ask you to do that.
If we follow this river, we'll be right on course.<eos> Right on course.<eos> To the end of our rainbow.<eos> Smurfs?<eos> I thought I left you for dead.
- Grab on!<eos> I don't know about this.<eos> You won't regret it.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you. Such a kind Smurf.
It's you.<eos> You're a girl.<eos> She's a girl.<eos> This is her.<eos> This is the Smurf I was telling you about.
Smurfblossom, remember, work on that filter, okay?<eos> - Right.<eos> Filter, filter.<eos> - What's your deal anyway?<eos> Well, we came to warn you about Gargamel.
- I...<eos> - Don't get too close, Willow.<eos> Something's not right here.<eos> I promise we're only here to help.<eos> We came to warn you about the evil wizard, Gargamel.
We came to warn you about the evil wizard, Gargamel.<eos> He has a map with a landmark leading him to three tall trees.<eos> - Show 'em, Brainy. - Snappy.<eos> Don't try any funny stuff, bug.<eos> I hate to break it to you, but those aren't trees.
Yeah, well, with no due respect, you don't know us.<eos> Trust us, he's a goner.<eos> Stormy, why don't you do a little recon?<eos> Check things out.<eos> And leave you here with these four?
She should stay with us forever.<eos> One, she always looks great.<eos> And two, this is getting a little out of hand, don't you think?<eos> Sorry.<eos> I can't take you seriously with that mask on your face.
They were right.<eos> This Gargamel character, he's real, and he's headed this way.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> See?<eos> I told you...
What?<eos> Smurfette, is that true?<eos> It's not like that.<eos> She was made to help him find Smurfs.<eos> Smurfette came here to help you.
What?<eos> What is all this talk about Garga...<eos> Gargamel!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Did I scare you?
Look at them!<eos> It's just like the neighbors.<eos> Go to my shed. You'll see I'm right!<eos> What have you done?<eos> Let me help you.
Told you something stinks.<eos> Now we know someone doesn't want us asking questions.<eos> Looks like you've cracked it wide open, mate.<eos> What did he say?<eos> I'm not playing telephone between you two.
Rama Kushna says this will break down the walls between the planes.<eos> Even the afterlife will be affected.<eos> Yeah, it's dodgy, all right.<eos> I'll look into it.<eos> Meanwhile, the House will drop you wherever you'd like.
A single human among your teeming masses.<eos> I only know John Constantine because he enrages me.<eos> Faust lives in an observatory which is invisible.<eos> It's a place where dark magic would infect the earth below it.<eos> I will take you there so you are no longer here.
If the shop found a snag, You'll find the artist, You will find a bank thief.<eos> It seems to me a simple matter.<eos> True, I thank you very much, old man. We'll get you a job in the police.<eos> Listen, I watch a television series.<eos> Called "Lo and Order" They solve crimes faster than you.
Called "Lo and Order" They solve crimes faster than you.<eos> You should see it.<eos> In the real world, It takes longer to solve crimes From an hour-long series.<eos> I think that's all, Mr. Harding.<eos> If we protest any additional information, We'll call you.
I think that's all, Mr. Harding.<eos> If we protest any additional information, We'll call you.<eos> I'll give you my address and phone number.<eos> This is not necessary.<eos> We will find you, this is our specialty.
Wixler kept a box. To meet the retirement plans concluded Prior to merger, Which would eventually unite With the new pension fund.<eos> Heaven forbid, can you speak clearly?<eos> With the cessation of US operations, There is no longer any financial responsibility for SIMTEC.<eos> The retirement fund will be dissolved.<eos> With all my respect, "Donald" 30 years of hard work Does not mean anything to you!
You will not eat a pie?<eos> We maintain our weights.<eos> We are also bankrupt.<eos> Well, do not book the table all day. I have to earn my living here.<eos> Did I tell you that those who took over the bank They were carrying guns?
Well, that's good.<eos> Well, stay away from me.<eos> Stay away, I'll look for your grandmother. It still has to pay for the meeting.<eos> Think about it Like killing a sick horse. Sometimes it is thinner The most moral work you can do.<eos> Well, thank you for your patience with me.

Are you with a man who calls himself Lucas?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Ella, listen to me very carefully.<eos> He's a professional assassin.<eos> We believe he's been hired to kill you.
Yeah.<eos> Ella, listen to me very carefully.<eos> He's a professional assassin.<eos> We believe he's been hired to kill you.<eos> We're going to trace this number, Ella, and we're going to get help to you right away.
I honestly don't know if he was making an agreement with your government, turning over information that could jeopardize my operations.<eos> Mr. Addison, let's speak frankly.<eos> The sale of narcotics generates enormous amounts of cash.<eos> One needs a secure way to launder those revenues in the U.S.<eos> Martin Hatto got greedy and stole from you.
No, no, I feel good.<eos> You did a good job.<eos> This isn't even your stop.<eos> We are now arriving in Lille.<eos> Please ensure you take all your belongings with you...
Just get out of here a minute.<eos> This was your plan?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> I trusted you.
I thought you were helping me, that that's what we came here to do.<eos> I thought you were helping me.<eos> Give me a minute.<eos> No, you were right.<eos> It's better your daughter never meets you.
Fuck!<eos> Now what?<eos> How much would it cost?<eos> What?<eos> To hire you.
What?<eos> To hire you.<eos> My parents are both dead.<eos> I'm going to inherit money.<eos> - I can pay you.
Addison International.<eos> They're in a meeting.<eos> May I take a message? Thank you.<eos> Good-bye.<eos> Can I help you?
Wait over there, please.<eos> I have, um, Ella Hatto here in reception for Mr. Addison.<eos> The guests will be arriving at the front gate and directed to the valet.<eos> The caterers will be distributing...<eos> There's an Ella Hatto waiting for you in reception.
Okay, this way, please.<eos> You're very lucky, Miss Hatto.<eos> Mr. Addison isn't going to press charges.<eos> You mean I'm free to go?<eos> An agent from the FBI will be taking custody of you.
Mr. Addison isn't going to press charges.<eos> You mean I'm free to go?<eos> An agent from the FBI will be taking custody of you.<eos> Ella, hello.<eos> I'm here to take you home.
Yeah.<eos> Now, I understand you have a bank account in Switzerland.<eos> Is that right?<eos> Yes.<eos> Your father set it up for you?
- Yes, sir.<eos> Good night, William.<eos> Metzger's behind me.<eos> I'm so sorry, excuse me.<eos> I'd love to show you around.
Metzger's behind me.<eos> I'm so sorry, excuse me.<eos> I'd love to show you around.<eos> I'm very sorry to interrupt.<eos> Mr. Addison, a call for you.
- Of course, of course.<eos> Diminished responsibility.<eos> If that Cunt in the original trial had put on a proper defense of diminished responsibility,<eos> I could've walked out that door a free man.<eos> I think, for you, that the best policy...
And then you went back on the heroin.<eos> My best friend.<eos> Actually, only friend who's never left us.<eos> What is this?<eos> - This is for you.
- I'm your blackmailer.<eos> And your salvation.<eos> You cooperate with me, no one will ever see this video.<eos> Now, my research suggests that, as deputy headmaster of one of Edinburgh's leading private schools, you earn, near enough, £70,000 per annum.<eos> It's not in my interest to squeeze you too hard, and it's not in your interest to provoke me.
"I love you.<eos> "I love Fergus more than anything.<eos> "But I'm finished, Gail.<eos> "I'm sorry.<eos> "Love you both.
Give a man a little bit of dignity for once, eh?<eos> Aye.<eos> All right, Frank.<eos> You're a good man, Mr. Wilson.<eos> I respect you for that.
Because he has a lot of money.<eos> Or at least he had a lot of money at the time, anyway.<eos> The room service guy, he comes in, and he sees this scene that I just described to you, and he says, "George Best..."<eos> Greatest footballer of all time.<eos> Exactly. "The greatest footballer of all time, I have to ask you,
Good.<eos> So you know that I own a couple of saunas in the north of Edinburgh.<eos> In fact, you boys should know, I own all the saunas in Edinburgh.<eos> So your venture was never gonna happen, was it?<eos> I couldn't have you on my doorstep in competition for my members of staff, for my clientele.
- No, Mr. Doyle.<eos> - Right answer.<eos> I wouldn't let it happen.<eos> And it's not gonna happen, right?<eos> Thankfully for you two,
- Right answer.<eos> I wouldn't let it happen.<eos> And it's not gonna happen, right?<eos> Thankfully for you two,<eos> I've done some due diligence on you, and what I hear is you're a couple of losers.
Have you read it?<eos> Well, not that one.<eos> But, you know, books...<eos> For your dinner table.<eos> Shall I join you this evening?
- Papa!<eos> - No!<eos> I'll come back!<eos> I promise!<eos> Forgive my intrusion, mademoiselle... but I have come to escort you to your room.
- Oh! - Be calm.<eos> Let me do the talking.<eos> You're making her dinner!<eos> Well, we thought you might appreciate the company.<eos> Master, I just want to assure you... that I had no part in this hopeless plan.
You've taken me as your prisoner and now you want to have dinner with me?<eos> Are you insane?<eos> He's losing it.<eos> Oh, dear!<eos> I told you to join me for dinner.
I told you to join me for dinner.<eos> And I told you no.<eos> What time is it?<eos> What's happening?<eos> I'd starve before I ever ate with you.
It's only Mrs. Potts.<eos> Oh, aren't you a vision!<eos> How lovely... to make your acquaintance.<eos> It's a very long journey.<eos> Let me fix you up... before you go.
It's a very long journey.<eos> Let me fix you up... before you go.<eos> I have found... that most troubles seem less troubling... after a bracing cup of tea.<eos> Slowly now, Chip.<eos> Pleased to meet you.
It has been so long since I have performed.<eos> I can barely even remember how.<eos> Another cavity.<eos> Maestro, your wife is upstairs... finding it harder and harder to stay awake.<eos> She's counting on you to help us break this curse.
Of course!<eos> Are there any other tasteless demands... you wish to make upon my artistry?<eos> No, that's it.<eos> There you are, dear.<eos> It is with deepest pride and greatest pleasure... that we welcome you tonight.
No, that's it.<eos> There you are, dear.<eos> It is with deepest pride and greatest pleasure... that we welcome you tonight.<eos> Here!<eos> And now... we invite you to relax.
Thank you, miss.<eos> We are eternally grateful.<eos> Why do you care about him so much?<eos> We've looked after him all his life.<eos> But he's cursed you somehow.
- Knick-knacks.<eos> Lightly-used houseware.<eos> Rubbish.<eos> We become rubbish.<eos> I want to help you.
King Arthur and the Round Table.<eos> Knights and men and swords and things.<eos> Still... it's a romance.<eos> All right.<eos> I never thanked you for saving my life.
A book that truly allows you to escape.<eos> How amazing!<eos> It was her cruelest trick of all.<eos> It was just another curse.<eos> The outside world has no place for a creature like me... but it can for you.
Maurice!<eos> Gaston... did you try to kill Maurice?<eos> Maurice!<eos> Thank heavens!<eos> I've spent the last five days... - trying to find you.
And now, it's too late.<eos> But she might still come back.<eos> No.<eos> I set her free.<eos> I'm sorry I couldn't do the same for all of you.
Please!<eos> He needs a hospital... not an asylum!<eos> Have you ever seen the inside of a mad house, Maurice?<eos> You wouldn't last a week.<eos> Just give me your daughter's hand, and I'll set you free.
This is the first time I've had any real hope she would.<eos> Did you hear that, Mama?<eos> Is it her? Is she coming back?<eos> Could it be?<eos> I told you!
But I would need... something long and sharp.<eos> Like that.<eos> Perfect.<eos> Oh, excuse me, Master.<eos> I'm so sorry to disturb you.
Yes, those are called books, you third rate musketeers.<eos> Oh! I'm off.<eos> Just a clock.<eos> Come here... little boys.<eos> I spin you this way.
Hello, beast.<eos> I'm Gaston.<eos> Belle sent me.<eos> Are you in love with her?<eos> Did you honestly think she'd want you?
Please!<eos> Come on.<eos> You came back.<eos> Of course I came back.<eos> I'll never leave you again.
I'll never leave you again.<eos> I'm afraid it's my turn to leave.<eos> We're together now.<eos> It's gonna be fine.<eos> At least I got to see you.
I can't... speak.<eos> It's all right, Cogsworth.<eos> I can't...<eos> Lumiere... my friend.<eos> It was an honor to serve... with you.
It was an honor to serve... with you.<eos> The honor was mine.<eos> Come back.<eos> Please don't leave me.<eos> I love you.
Turn back into a clock.<eos> Lumiere, look!<eos> Oh, my Prince!<eos> Hello, old friend.<eos> Oh! It's so good to see you.
That sounds good.<eos> Great!<eos> I'll see you later.<eos> You have a nice family.<eos> Thank you. You as well.
Bureauissettingupbase camp inJoseph.<eos> Over. Tell him we'll be there within the hour.<eos> Mr. Phillips, go get your kids.<eos> Mr. Phillips, there isn't one person in this room who doesn't care about your missy.<eos> We're doing everything in our power to bring her back safely to you.
Sarah who? Sarayu.<eos> It means "a breath of wind."<eos> Right.<eos> So...<eos> Which one of you is...
Ever.<eos> Dreaming or otherwise.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Let me ask you somethin'.<eos> I've been tellin' you all about Josh and Kate and nan.
Okay.<eos> Watch this one.<eos> Incredible.<eos> I get that you're all connected.<eos> But I feel way more relaxed around you.
She blames herself for missy's death.<eos> You had your own guilt to deal with.<eos> But the time for blame is over.<eos> When I go back,<eos> I still want you in my life.
I always was.<eos> I always am.<eos> I always will be.<eos> That's good.<eos> 'Cause I've become especially fond of you.
Cards are still the ultimate challenge.<eos> For you, maybe.<eos> Sweet talk will get you nowhere.<eos> You.<eos> Mr. Wentworth, Mr. Styvesan wants to see you.
- I'll fold.<eos> - What was that?<eos> I'll fold.<eos> Fold what, cards?<eos> We have machines behind you that fold cards, Ray.
Okay, Ray, I'm sorry.<eos> I'm gonna have to take your guild card.<eos> Come on.<eos> Ray, why don't you, um, get your stuff some other time, okay?<eos> We'll keep it safe for you.
I have to watch him for my damn sister while she goes to school to learn how to clean teeth, and it's against the law for me to take him to the track.<eos> And I can't push him off the roof.<eos> You're in a real pickle.<eos> - Well, how about that.<eos> I thought he'd be afraid of you.
Told him you'd be here tonight.<eos> How'd you know?<eos> 'Cause you're an alcoholic.<eos> Hey, Styvesan, how's tricks?<eos> The same. Look, I got a business proposition for you.
Don't do it, Ray.<eos> Thanks for the advice.<eos> Come on, Denny.<eos> Karen, Ray's here!<eos> Well, I guess I should invite you in.
What happened to him?<eos> Shouldn't I be asking you that?<eos> - You think that I...?<eos> - He was your competition, right?<eos> You got somebody watching over you.
You got somebody watching over you.<eos> For now.<eos> But you've got to deliver.<eos> Deliver what?<eos> Oh, I'll tell you what.
People will go nuts.<eos> Everything for a hundred bucks.<eos> On the table.<eos> I mean, well, name your price.<eos> And what about you?
Your husband was the writer I always measured myself against.<eos> And I always came up short.<eos> Well... won me over with a card.<eos> I'm afraid I wasn't the greatest prize.<eos> Well, he talked about you.
Well, he talked about you.<eos> A lot.<eos> I pushed him around.<eos> I didn't kill him, though.<eos> I don't recognize you.
This way.<eos> Just down here.<eos> Through this vestibule.<eos> And through this door.<eos> Ah! Good to finally meet you, Mr. Wentworth.
Hello, darling!<eos> The word is, you have a sweetheart, Mr. Wentworth.<eos> How do you know?<eos> Detective Miller. He works for me on the side.<eos> I thought Styvesan worked for you.
Among many others.<eos> But this girlfriend of yours, congratulations.<eos> That's good, that's very good.<eos> I mean, after all, you need to feel the feelings before you can write about them.<eos> So I write the card for her and I give it to you.
Baby shoes.<eos> Um... who do those belong to?<eos> Yeah, those... Those are actually mine.<eos> Um, they're... they're my sho...<eos> Beat you to it.
He said that you said that it was your best card ever.<eos> So, tell it!<eos> Ask the woman.<eos> She saw it.<eos> I'm never gonna tell you.
I intend for her to have the best and be the best, and she will never hear a whisper of her no-account, drug addict birth father or her whore of a mother.<eos> Nobody better'n nobody.<eos> After all that, I gave them the damn card.<eos> They found a nice, cheery front to sell it, and that did the trick.<eos> Made people feel good, I guess, the kind of good feeling some dumb card can give you.
- What is strange?<eos> - Help me. - I need a job.<eos> Help me with the trash.<eos> I did not come to talk about it.<eos> - I came to be with you.
- Sorry.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> Forgives.<eos> Agree. Sorry.<eos> After you.
They are on his side.<eos> - Do you know him?<eos> - Do not.<eos> I'm going.<eos> This is because I almost killed you.
Sometimes you feel like a baby.<eos> As if someone else had to take care of the situation.<eos> "I can not do anything. What I do?".<eos> You could go to work and make money.<eos> But people expect things from you. They want you to do other things.
It's good that you had that time.<eos> Yes, it was great.<eos> - Yes. - Fabulous.<eos> Take care.<eos> - Nice to see you.
Take care.<eos> - Nice to see you.<eos> - Bye.<eos> - Beware.<eos> - I'm glad to see you.
And since the wheel lugs they found belonged to a '24 Chrysler... and, well... this is a '24 Chrysler.<eos> She found you yet?<eos> Gabriela?<eos> See...<eos> I'm not looking for you, Wolvie.
Gabriela?<eos> See...<eos> I'm not looking for you, Wolvie.<eos> Well, not really.<eos> I'm looking for someone who's looking for you.
Hello?<eos> Shit.<eos> Hey, Sam.<eos> Morning.<eos> "I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus.
On the inside you're sick.<eos> I can smell it.<eos> Best night ever!<eos> Hey, driver.<eos> I love you. I love you.
Anyone can do that job.<eos> I'll give you $50,000.<eos> How did you find me, huh?<eos> 'Cause you are fucking up my life, lady!<eos> The people after you, they're on my ass now!
Look. Here, take this.<eos> It's $20,000.<eos> Here. Take us to this address.<eos> You can have $30,000 more when we get there.<eos> My friends there will give it to you.
Where's Caliban?<eos> Why don't you tell me where the girl is first?<eos> Or I could ask Cue Ball.<eos> He seems quite friendly.<eos> I told you, she's not here.
He seems quite friendly.<eos> I told you, she's not here.<eos> Where's Caliban, motherfucker?<eos> Well, I left him in the same ditch he was gonna leave me in.<eos> Jesus, Wolverine, seeing you like this just breaks my damn heart.
Who are you?<eos> You know who she is, Logan.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> Does she remind you of anybody?<eos> I read about you when I was a kid.
You were helping round up all those old mutes.<eos> What changed?<eos> You got religion?<eos> I'm gonna need you to do one more thing for the good guys... and track one more special mute for me.<eos> I'm not helping you.
I'm not helping you.<eos> Of course, you'd say that.<eos> But I got a theory that people don't really change.<eos> Beware of the light.<eos> Caliban, I bet that's what your mama told you every day when you was a kid.
Caliban, I bet that's what your mama told you every day when you was a kid.<eos> Beware of the light.<eos> Now, let's not bring out the worst in each other.<eos> The girl is not worth it, trust me.<eos> She's not a natural fuck-up like you.
My name is Gabriela López.<eos> I am a nurse.<eos> And for 10 years, I worked for Transigen Research in Mexico City.<eos> Transigen is owned by an American company.<eos> What I am about to show you is illegal... in the U.S. And Canada.
She's not my child.<eos> But I love her.<eos> You may not love her.<eos> But she is your child.<eos> Please. I beg you... take her to safety.
Please. I beg you... take her to safety.<eos> Is this where we're hiding out?<eos> We're not hiding out.<eos> We're gonna get a couple of hours' sleep... clean up, get some new clothes, get a new ride and get outta here.<eos> Harrah's Hotel and Casino welcomes you to Oklahoma City.
I guess you prefer me pharmaceutically castrated, rambling on like a lunatic.<eos> So much easier for you.<eos> Easier?<eos> Jesus!<eos> There is nothing easy about you, Charles, nothing!
That's your daughter?<eos> Yeah, that's Laura, and that's my dad...<eos> Chuck.<eos> Come on, Laura, let's go.<eos> Well, can we show our appreciation and treat the three of you to a decent meal?
He believes you've been dispensing delayed information... to allow your friends to stay one step ahead.<eos> I'm offering you the possibility of redemption, Caliban.<eos> To protect the world, and in the process, save your friends.<eos> The girl is a rather small price to pay for that.<eos> Unlike you, she's impure.
Your colleagues are savages.<eos> I agree.<eos> The Reavers were very ineffective.<eos> But I'm bringing new tools to bear. But I still need someone to point us in the right direction.<eos> No, I can't help you.
Oh, yeah, no.<eos> Um...<eos> I got kicked out a few times.<eos> I wish I could say you were a good pupil, but the words would choke me.<eos> Ma'am, I can't thank you enough for this.
Sometimes it gets itself shut off.<eos> - By assholes.<eos> - Hey!<eos> No.<eos> My son is happy to go with you.
- Huh?<eos> Mute.<eos> Uh, since the beginning.<eos> Mmm.<eos> Well, in a lot of ways, I envy you.
Huh.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> "Previous" being the operative word.<eos> Who's this?<eos> Just a guy telling you to get back in your nice truck.
I think I finally understand you.<eos> Logan...<eos> He's fantastic.<eos> You said you only needed the girl!<eos> I told you I was forced to bring a new tool to bear.
Come out here now, Munson.<eos> There's that asshole.<eos> Hello, asshole.<eos> Listen, I'm willing to let bygones be bygones.<eos> I don't know what Munson's paying you... but Canewood can start you out at five G.
What?<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> Shoot him!<eos> We need to intervene.<eos> Well, he only listens to you, Doctor.
Shit!<eos> Fuck! Fuck!<eos> Welcome back.<eos> I was starting to think I was gonna have to tell... that nice little girl out in the waiting room... her daddy's gone.<eos> I'd always hoped... that I'd get the chance to meet someone like you.
Where did you get that?<eos> Where we came from.<eos> They gave it to us when we would fight. It makes you stronger.<eos> It makes you crazy, is what it does.<eos> It'll kill you.
That's the border.<eos> That's where we will be safe.<eos> Come inside.<eos> Laura told me all that you did for her.<eos> She was lucky to have you.
"It takes courage to grow up and to become who you really are."<eos> Right? E.E. Cummings wrote that.<eos> And, guys, you're growing up.<eos> You're moving on.<eos> For many of you, this is gonna be the last English class you're ever gonna take.
Uh, let me explain.<eos> He was just masturbating.<eos> And he was just watching.<eos> I wasn't watching. I caught you.<eos> Just get out of here before I report you.
Maybe the best thing to do is talk to Neil?<eos> Oh, I did.<eos> Yeah. Neil's not talkin' either.<eos> So, then I went back to this.<eos> I'm back to needing a straight answer from one of you two.
I'm back to needing a straight answer from one of you two.<eos> Right.<eos> Let me bottom-line this for you.<eos> Someone's going down for this.<eos> I'm firing one of you two today.
Let me bottom-line this for you.<eos> Someone's going down for this.<eos> I'm firing one of you two today.<eos> Tell you what, how about we'll go one better.<eos> How about I fire you both?
What did you hear?<eos> Hashtag teacher fight? What is this?<eos> You guys are tweeting about this now?<eos> Why would you agree to fight Strickland?<eos> He could kill you.
I never said nothing about no running.<eos> Who's you? Seabiscuit?<eos> That was a great talk.<eos> Like, so super-helpful.<eos> - Both of you, really.
I'm just asking you to do your job here.<eos> You're asking me to do the job of security guard after 3:00, when I'm not...<eos> So you're telling me that there's nothing you can do?<eos> I could do CPR.<eos> I could potentially revive you after he renders you unconscious.
If it's after school hours, you're just gonna lay there all night until 7:00 a.m., when I'll come and save your life.<eos> Shit.<eos> All right.<eos> You cussed.<eos> I'm gonna write you up!
MacBook Pro.<eos> I'm sorry, what?<eos> I'll do it for a MacBook Pro.<eos> Are you trying to blackmail me?<eos> Want me to lie for you or not?
Yeah?<eos> I'll see you later, Mr. Campbell.<eos> Okay.<eos> What a day.<eos> How can I help you?
Thank you for your bravery.<eos> Well, what's going on?<eos> What the fuck is going on?<eos> That's a great question.<eos> Okay, I'm sorry for misleading you both, but this is a mediation.
What the hell are you talking about?<eos> Who are you? I...<eos> Holly.<eos> We've been flirting, like, all fucking year.<eos> I've been, like, ignoring you all year.
Who are you? I...<eos> Holly.<eos> We've been flirting, like, all fucking year.<eos> I've been, like, ignoring you all year.<eos> Because I've been playing games with you all year.
I can be a dick, too.<eos> You wanna see me be a dick?<eos> Hmm. So what do you teach here?<eos> I teach gym, but I'm a singer.<eos> Can I sing a song to you?
It did! It did.<eos> Why you keep shaking your legs like you got something down there<eos> - moving.<eos> - Because you make me nervous.<eos> Because I feel love when I see you.
Not aces.<eos> We're mere servants.<eos> My tiger's not in the mood.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Seth, I've been working for years under you.
It's an awesome party!<eos> Hang on.<eos> Hey, gymnast!<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Who invited you here?
My heart desires to feel you.<eos> Sir, this is the beginning of organized crime.<eos> If Raees isn't stopped now, he'll burn the whole of Gujarat.<eos> After this terrible incident under your jurisdiction, are you teaching me?<eos> Now you give me in writing why I shouldn't be transferring you!
- Sure.<eos> No more bulldozers. Just cameras flashing.<eos> Officers posed for the cameras and made the front pages of newspapers with 'seized' liquor.<eos> The press, the police, the government, all were a satisfied lot.<eos> Raees has sent shirts for you.
No more bulldozers. Just cameras flashing.<eos> Officers posed for the cameras and made the front pages of newspapers with 'seized' liquor.<eos> The press, the police, the government, all were a satisfied lot.<eos> Raees has sent shirts for you.<eos> See if the color suits you.
Transfer Majmudar to some godforsaken place, sir!<eos> He is a constant pain in my neck.<eos> He's a police officer, not a pawn I can play around with.<eos> He arrested Damla.<eos> Majmudar has started a fire in Kutch. The flames could torch me and eventually reach you.
You have to pay only half the amount. And the rest in ten years.<eos> You can pay in monthly installments for the next ten years.<eos> Is ten years too short a period?<eos> Don't worry, don't be apprehensive<eos> I guarantee you. This is my neighborhood, you are my people.
- Sure.<eos> Listen. This is for Dulari's baby.<eos> Deliver the bottle of milk to her right away.<eos> Distribute the meals in police vans.<eos> - Raees sends food for all of you. - Raees!
You are innocent. And to prove that, you should live.<eos> If you don't escape, they will... kill you!<eos> Sadiq is right.<eos> - Get out of here, please! - No!<eos> If I escape, the cops will make life miserable for you.
No, no!<eos> 63 dead.<eos> You are him.<eos> You're Caesar.<eos> We've been searching for you for so long.
I know these apes.<eos> They followed Koba.<eos> They tried to kill me.<eos> They fear what I will do to them.<eos> So now they serve you... just to survive.
They fear what I will do to them.<eos> So now they serve you... just to survive.<eos> I no fear you!<eos> You must fear!<eos> How long you think woods can protect you?
So now they serve you... just to survive.<eos> I no fear you!<eos> You must fear!<eos> How long you think woods can protect you?<eos> Humans destroy you.
Humans destroy you.<eos> Their Colonel has all power.<eos> For them, he more than just human.<eos> He everything.<eos> He say: "First Caesar die... then all of you die."
We all are...<eos> But we are still planning...<eos> Yes.<eos> We must find a safe way out of woods.<eos> There were only two of you.
Caesar!<eos> You're not going after them? !<eos> Not them, him.<eos> Caesar, you are our leader!<eos> We can't leave without you!
Caesar!<eos> The soldiers' camp is always moving.<eos> My guards think they know where it is.<eos> Let me take you.<eos> -You need me to back you up!
long time.<eos> Home.<eos> Old home.<eos> SIERRA ZOO<eos> Are there more like you?
Soldier?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Then...<eos> Maybe I take you.
Luca gave his life.<eos> Please!<eos> They must pay.<eos> Now... you sound like Koba.<eos> It was a mistake bringing you all.
I was surprised you weren't with them.<eos> I hope you don't come to regret sparing his life.<eos> He's quite a good shot.<eos> Have you finally come to save your apes?<eos> I came for you.
Who did I kill that night?<eos> My wife.<eos> My son.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I was there for you.
Look at your eyes.<eos> Almost human.<eos> How did you know I was here?<eos> -I was told you were coming.<eos> That more soldiers from the north... would be joining you here. -Joining me?
-Must think!<eos> What would Caesar do?<eos> No!<eos> Why so small?<eos> What did the Colonel promised you?
-The soldiers who are coming here, they are not coming to join you, are they?<eos> I saw men outside, on the wall, preparing for battle.<eos> They told me you're smart, but that's impressive.<eos> No, they won't be joining me.<eos> They are against you?
You're much stronger than we are.<eos> You're smart as hell.<eos> No matter what you say, you'd eventually replace us.<eos> That's the law of Nature.<eos> The irony is, we created you.
This wall is madness.<eos> It won't save him.<eos> Anymore that it will save you.<eos> I save myself.<eos> Is there anything left of you to safe?
No!<eos> No, no!<eos> No, no!<eos> Okay.<eos> This is the ape I told you about!
BRATT STEALS WORLD'S BIGGEST DIAMOND<eos> No, no...<eos> you've got to be kidding me.<eos> Lucy, did you see...<eos> He helps you if you have nightmares, and he's really good to snuggle with...
Ow.<eos> Seriously?<eos> Buddy, you're not getting the hint.<eos> Excuse me, Mr. Gru.<eos> But I really must have a word with you.
Twin brother?<eos> - Twin brother?<eos> - Twin brother?<eos> Oh Yeah.<eos> He would like to fly you to Freedonia to meet him.
- You must be the beautiful wife!<eos> Beautiful, oh.<eos> Stop it!<eos> Sweet talker.<eos> How is my brother finding a wife like you when he is so bald?
Woo-hoo!<eos> These must be my nieces!<eos> Huh!<eos> You're Agnes, you're small with big eyes!<eos> And it makes me want to put you in my pocket!
I feel worse than I did before I came.<eos> Oh, but he's your brother, Gru.<eos> Give him a chance.<eos> Oh, I was thinking, while Gru and I catch up on some brother stuff, you girls should go with Fritz.<eos> He has a surprise for you.
Oh, wait!<eos> No, it's not!<eos> I hate that tweeb!<eos> And you, Hollywood!<eos> This time, I'm canceling you!
This time, I'm canceling you!<eos> And all the losers who rejected me!<eos> Ha ha ha... !<eos> Ooooo, piggy, piggy!<eos> So how are things going for you, career-wise?
Ohhhh, it's real alright.<eos> That horn came from the Crooked Forest.<eos> The only place on earth where unicorns still live.<eos> Laugh!<eos> Laugh, all of you!
The only place on earth where unicorns still live.<eos> Laugh!<eos> Laugh, all of you!<eos> They all think I'm crazy.<eos> But I'm telling you, I saw one once.
But...<eos> I want to be in on the actions!<eos> The getaway driver is the most crucial part of any plan.<eos> Do you know how hard it is doing nothing, touching nothing, with all of the adrenaline coursing through your veins... and you must wait.<eos> Can I count on you?
Now is not the time to mess with the plan.<eos> Fine...<eos> - Hey, brother.<eos> - What?<eos> I told you, you were supposed to stay with the boat!
- Why?<eos> I can do it.<eos> - Don't, don't, don't!<eos> Yes, yes, Molly Ringwald.<eos> I will take you to the prom.
Will you please shut up?<eos> He's gonna spot us.<eos> Spit it out!<eos> Spit it out!<eos> I told you not to touch anything!
Intruders!<eos> Intruders!<eos> Freeze, dipsticks!<eos> Gru!<eos> There's two of you now?
- No!<eos> - Give it!<eos> Ow!<eos> What is wrong with you?<eos> What is wrong with you?
Oh, yeah?<eos> Well, at least I didn't get fired from my job like a total loser.<eos> At least I had a job.<eos> What have you accomplished that was so great?<eos> I'll tell you what:
No!<eos> Dru!<eos> Dru!<eos> Go away.<eos> I don't want to talk to you.
Chew on this!<eos> Hey, mullet-head.<eos> Let us out!<eos> Oh, don't worry, girls.<eos> I've prepared a front row seat for you.
You've ruined everything.<eos> And now, it's time to die.<eos> Any last words, Gru?<eos> You know what?<eos> I got two words for you.
Uh huh.<eos> All of your psych evals, have been passed correct?<eos> Yes, yes ma'am.<eos> OK.<eos> So here's the deal. I have you in our database so the trip wasn't for nothing, okay.
Oh can's down at the end.<eos> Keep it clean.<eos> Oh, Command HQ.<eos> Eyes and ears of the whole place.<eos> Uh we got a corner Cubby set up for you. Right in there.
You step away from these doors your answer is no, got it?<eos> Are you in charge here or are you not?<eos> You said no, so step away.<eos> Come on.<eos> Let me break this down for you.
It's the right thing. Hey!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> The real man in charge.<eos> You should have let him take the blame. For getting every man, woman and child in this building killed.<eos> Your country thanks you for your service.
Yeah. He's Eddie.<eos> He's in charge. You told her what's going on?<eos> For the most part.<eos> The girl, the gang.<eos> I'm with you.
I have a little announcement to make to my guys, Eddie, and seeing as how we're chatting now anyway, I think it might benefit your team to hear it as well.<eos> So, everybody on?<eos> So my guys, listen up.<eos> I've uh-spoken to our mutual employer and after tonight's little snafu, there's now a bonus in place.<eos> If we succeed and the girl dies, each one of you gets an extra 100 thousand dollars.
So my guys, listen up.<eos> I've uh-spoken to our mutual employer and after tonight's little snafu, there's now a bonus in place.<eos> If we succeed and the girl dies, each one of you gets an extra 100 thousand dollars.<eos> Here's the rub;<eos> if we fail, if she lives to see another day- every last one of you will be hunted down and killed.
Come on!<eos> Come on!<eos> Good girl.<eos> What a shit night.<eos> She'll trust you.
Utterly.<eos> No need for stimulants now, remember?<eos> I have work to do.<eos> You're high as a kite!<eos> Natural high, I assure you.
You're home and dry.<eos> OK, cheers.<eos> Obviously, there's unfinished business.<eos> Moriarty.<eos> I told you - Moriarty's dead.
Yes.<eos> You also say you know what he's going to do next.<eos> - What does that mean?<eos> - Perhaps that's all there is to it.<eos> Perhaps he was just trying to frighten you.
He's planned something, something long-term.<eos> Something that would take effect if he never made it off that rooftop alive.<eos> Posthumous revenge.<eos> No, better than that - posthumous game.<eos> We brought you back to deal with this.
"Very well," said the merchant.<eos> "I give in. I am yours."<eos> "But tell me, why did you look surprised when you saw me this morning in Baghdad?"<eos> "Because," said Death,<eos> "I had an appointment with you tonight... ..in Samarra."
God is a ludicrous fiction, dreamt up by inadequates who abnegate all responsibility to an invisible magic friend.<eos> Yeah, but there'll be cake.<eos> Will you do it?<eos> I'll get back to you.<eos> Father, we ask you to send your blessings on this water and sanctify it for our use this day.
I mean, it's right up your strasse.<eos> Mr and Mrs Welsborough, I really am most terribly sorry to hear about your daughter.<eos> - Son. - Son!<eos> Mr and Mrs Welsborough, this is Mr Sherlock Holmes.<eos> Thank you very much for coming.
Mr and Mrs Welsborough, I really am most terribly sorry to hear about your daughter.<eos> - Son. - Son!<eos> Mr and Mrs Welsborough, this is Mr Sherlock Holmes.<eos> Thank you very much for coming.<eos> We've heard a great deal about you.
Who?<eos> - You'll see.<eos> - Right, are you coming?<eos> No, he's got a lunch date with a brunette forensic officer that he doesn't want to be late for.<eos> - Who told you?
- Who told you?<eos> - The right sleeve of your jacket, plus the formaldehyde mixed with your cologne and your complete inability to stop looking at your watch.<eos> - Have a good time.<eos> - I will.<eos> Trust me, though, she's not right for you.
God, I just wanted a bit of peace, and I really thought I had it.<eos> No, Mary...<eos> You do.<eos> I made a vow, remember?<eos> To look after the three of you.
I don't feel so good.<eos> You're all right.<eos> Oh, you're sweet.<eos> You have a very kind face.<eos> God will smile on you.
Not like this one.<eos> You haven't got a chance, not a chance.<eos> I've got you where I want you.<eos> Give in, give in!<eos> I will destroy you.
Hello.<eos> Karim, would you be so kind as to fetch us some tea?<eos> - Sure.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Nice to meet you, missus.
- All the time.<eos> You're always a good man, John, I've never doubted that.<eos> You never judge, you never complain.<eos> I don't deserve you, I...<eos> All I ever wanted to do was keep you and Rosie safe, that's all.
Yeah, OK, you win.<eos> 'Ladies and gentlemen, the aquarium will be closing in five minutes.<eos> 'Please make your way to the exit.<eos> Thank you.'<eos> Your office said I'd find you here.
There's no way out.<eos> So it would seem.<eos> You've seen right through me, Mr Holmes.<eos> It's what I do.<eos> Maybe I can still surprise you.
'You've been having dreams.<eos> A recurring dream?<eos> Do you want to talk about it?<eos> This is a two-way relationship, you know.<eos> The whole world has come crashing down around you.
I'll go see him after this drink.<eos> Headquarters MI6<eos> - London<eos> Reporters' teams were not allowed on the site.<eos> She's waiting for you.
- A good guy.<eos> - Very good !<eos> According to your case, You declined 3 assignments and a promotion. Why ?<eos> We go where we think we can give the best.<eos> If it's to avenge Marty, I'll send you back to the States.
If it's to avenge Marty, I'll send you back to the States.<eos> - I can manage.<eos> - I do not care.<eos> A misguided mind is a risk.<eos> I will not be plumbing Because Marty obsesses you. Is that clear ?
- I do not care.<eos> A misguided mind is a risk.<eos> I will not be plumbing Because Marty obsesses you. Is that clear ?<eos> Clear.<eos> We are waiting for you at MI6.
But he was the best shooter in his unit Five years in a row.<eos> In addition to the camera, It had a semi-automatic.<eos> Cartridges 7.62 x 51 NATO nomenclature.<eos> Easy shot at 600 meters.<eos> It looks like you.
He had time to get them out of Italy.<eos> The murders of Barovski in Ukraine are the key.<eos> After all these years, he will take revenge.<eos> To proclaim to the Russians:<eos> "I can destroy you."
Mr. Miller?<eos> Mr. Thomas Miller?<eos> From Indianapolis to Indiana?<eos> You will be treated at the embassy.<eos> "Your captors have beaten you?"
You must never use your powers for personal gain.<eos> You must never escalate a fight, unless your enemy forces you to.<eos> And you must never reveal your identity.<eos> Ever. To assume your ranger identities, you need to morph.<eos> Have any of you morphed before?
Alpha 5, begin the exercise.<eos> Uh... sorry, guys.<eos> - What exercise?<eos> - Chill out, dude.<eos> These creatures before you are a simulation of Rita's army.
Rita could be building Goldar as we speak.<eos> - Don't underestimate me or my team.<eos> - You can't stop him.<eos> She will have him dig up the crystal and life on earth will die.<eos> And we need you.
- Jason, you need me out of this wall. To help lead this team!<eos> Your team's dead.<eos> And you're just as scared as we are.<eos> These... are all 24 karat gold bands.<eos> Hello, I'll be right with you.
I'll get you anything you want.<eos> You're so sweet.<eos> Get my cookie anything she wants.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Uh... can I help you?
Oh! You're not entirely disappointing.<eos> Oh, look at you.<eos> Trying to figure out my plan.<eos> I'll just tell you.<eos> Yellow has led you to your deaths.
Oh, look at you.<eos> Trying to figure out my plan.<eos> I'll just tell you.<eos> Yellow has led you to your deaths.<eos> Because I'm going to kill you, one by one, until you tell me, where is my crystal?
We don't know.<eos> No, Red.<eos> You don't know!<eos> But guess what?<eos> One of you does.
- Krispy Kreme. This is a special place?<eos> - Very special.<eos> - It must be. The source of life itself is buried there.<eos> Thank you, Blue, for being so weak.<eos> Zordon would lose all respect for me if I don't kill you.
- Very special.<eos> - It must be. The source of life itself is buried there.<eos> Thank you, Blue, for being so weak.<eos> Zordon would lose all respect for me if I don't kill you.<eos> - At least one of you.
I guess the bully... you guys don't get...<eos> It's the...<eos> Oh, that was scary.<eos> We did it.<eos> I told you we'd be famous.
I'm coming!<eos> This ranger team did what my team could not.<eos> You will humbly walk amongst your peers, but heroes you all will be.<eos> - Attention! Attention in detention.<eos> - Each of your names will be etched alongside the great ranger teams before you.
This ranger team did what my team could not.<eos> You will humbly walk amongst your peers, but heroes you all will be.<eos> - Attention!

We can stick together. We can survive.<eos> Can we get him water?<eos> Here, here, here.<eos> Drink this.<eos> I'm just so glad that I found you.
It's worse alone on the sea.<eos> I don't get why...<eos> It doesn't make any sense.<eos> Why are you so determined to give up?<eos> What brought you here?
- Roger that.<eos> So what're you gonna do when you get back to the world, Chapman?<eos> I'm already set up with Eastern Air Lines.<eos> Grace and Billy all moved in in Atlanta, just waiting on me.<eos> What about you, sir?
Go have some fun.<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> Tip-top.<eos> Colonel Packard!<eos> There's a phone call for you.
There's no tactical precedence.<eos> We did the best we could in the situation.<eos> Griffin, Cole!<eos> Thank God you guys are okay.<eos> - Good to see you, sir. - We're all right.
Where's Randa?<eos> - How you doing? - I'm fine.<eos> Thank you. Good.<eos> Glad to hear it.<eos> I was worried about you.
Shake it off, guys!<eos> Let's move out.<eos> Stay tight.<eos> What the hell is this?<eos> - Behind you!
They never smile.<eos> Did you crash here?<eos> Sorry, miss.<eos> Lieutenant Hank Marlow of the 45th.<eos> Put the old flight suit on for you.
The Iwis won't speak their name.<eos> But I call them skull-crawlers.<eos> Why?<eos> 'Cause it sounds neat.<eos> - Look, I just made that name up. - I'm trying to scare you.
- You're talking. - Am I?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - I'm talking? - Yes.<eos> - Your mouth is moving. What?<eos> I'm gonna stab you by the end of the night.
Truth is, I don't expect them to be waiting.<eos> I'd be fine either way.<eos> I just want one last chance to see them.<eos> That'd be good enough for me.<eos> We're gonna get you home.
That'd be good enough for me.<eos> We're gonna get you home.<eos> Fox Five, come back.<eos> Is there anyone out there? Hey!<eos> This is Fox Five. We hear you. Yeah!
It's more of, like, a plane than a boat, really.<eos> Let's call it a "ploat."<eos> - We're on a ploat.<eos> - We need their location, Slivko.<eos> Hey, send up a flare so we can find you.
- Not our fight.<eos> - Whose side are you on, Captain?<eos> Okay, Colonel.<eos> You'll find your Sea Stallion three klicks up that ridge.<eos> Now, I'm gonna take these civilians back to the boat, and we'll wait for you there.
- Arm one.<eos> Arm three.<eos> Packard!<eos> Don't do it.<eos> I asked you fellas nice the first time.
Yeah.<eos> - I mean, I thought maybe you were dead. - Heh.<eos> Oh, no, no, no, I'm not dead.<eos> Why don't you tell me what your goal is for this work?<eos> I don't wanna take medication and I don't wanna talk to you.
He asked me not to tell anyone.<eos> I never did.<eos> It's time for checks, Maxwell.<eos> Maxwell?<eos> A few days, but he doesn't want to talk to you.
It's time for checks, Maxwell.<eos> Maxwell?<eos> A few days, but he doesn't want to talk to you.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - I'll try and get him to call you later.
- Thank you so much.<eos> - Of course, Nancy.<eos> Thank you, doctor.<eos> I'll look forward to hearing from you soon then, right?<eos> - I'm sure he'll call you later.
- This is Max. Leave a message.<eos> - Mom, are you okay?<eos> Do you remember when you traded all of your Barbies for all of Maxwell's collection of little race cars, remember that?<eos> No, I don't.<eos> I got so mad at you and I was really mad at both of you.
I suppose I was just looking away.<eos> There is a difference between looking away and looking to.<eos> - I tend to notice these things.<eos> - I'm sure.<eos> Now, I am reminding you of your friend, I think.
No one's seen him.<eos> He's locked himself away in his flat. God knows what he's up to.<eos> Do you blame him? I don't blame him...<eos> I don't think about him.<eos> Has he attempted to make contact with you?
Sells mainly to dentists and hospitals, for minor surgical procedures.<eos> Interferes with...<eos> - The memory.<eos> - The memory.<eos> I want to thank you, Ivan, for allowing me to use it.
But you, I think, might have a need to forget.<eos> By the end of this, you'll be free to go, and don't worry, by the time you're back in the outside world you will not remember any of what you've heard.<eos> - Ignorance is bliss.<eos> - What's wrong with bliss?<eos> Some of you know each other and some of you don't.

If the sunlight was able to penetrate the room when the sun was lower in the sky, then the paper would be equally faded. Top to bottom, but no.<eos> It only makes it when the sun is at its zenith. So, I'm betting that you live in a narrow street, on the ground floor.<eos> Now, if steeply angled sunlight manages to hit eye level on the wall opposite the window, then what do we know about the room?<eos> The room's small.<eos> - Big brother is watching you.
That's very touching how you can hijack the machinery of the state to look after your own family.<eos> Can I go to sleep now?<eos> Sherlock gone rogue is a legitimate security concern.<eos> The fact that I'm his brother changes absolutely nothing.<eos> It didn't the last time, and I assure you it won't...
- What are you doing here?<eos> What were you doing in the middle of a bloody street?<eos> - You should be at Baker Street.<eos> - I am. So are you.<eos> They found your address. They brought you here.
- John.<eos> - Mrs Hudson.<eos> Do you have any idea what speed you were going at? Of course, not.<eos> I was on the phone.<eos> - It's for you, by the way.
"and build up every spirit to his full height.<eos> "On! On, you noblest English whose blood is fet from fathers, from war-proof!"<eos> "And you, good yeoman, whose limbs were made in England, show us."<eos> "Here the mettle of your pasture!"<eos> "I doubt not, for there is none of you here so mean and base"
Don't you dare! I was terrified.<eos> A cup of tea!<eos> For goodness' sakes! What's the matter with you? Are you having an earthquake?<eos> You need to see him, John. You need to help him!<eos> He needs you!
- How did you get him in the boot?<eos> - The boys from the cafe.<eos> They dropped me. Twice!<eos> And you know why they dropped you, dear?<eos> Because they know you.
- It'll have to be a hug.<eos> - I know.<eos> Sherlock.<eos> What can I say?<eos> Thanks to you, we're, we're everywhere.
- I know.<eos> Sherlock.<eos> What can I say?<eos> Thanks to you, we're, we're everywhere.<eos> Mr Holmes, how did Culverton talk you into this?
Plain sight.<eos> Mr Holmes. Culverton wants to know if you're okay going straight to the hospital.<eos> - Hospital?<eos> - Culverton's doing a visit.<eos> The kids would love to meet you both.
Maybe you could tell us about some of your cases.<eos> Yes! Absolutely, yes!<eos> The main feature of interest in the field of criminal investigation is not the sensational aspects of the crime itself but rather, the iron chain of reasoning from cause to effect, that reveals, step-by-step, the solution.<eos> That's the only truly remarkable aspect of the entire affair.<eos> Now, I will share with you the facts and evidence, as they were available to me. And in this very room, you will all attempt to solve the case of Blessington, the poisoner.
God save the Queen!<eos> She could open a slaughterhouse and we'd all probably pay the entrance fee.<eos> No one's untouchable.<eos> No one?<eos> Look at you all.
Yeah, it was mine from a long time ago.<eos> Hello?<eos> Ward 73.<eos> Dr Watson...<eos> It's for you.
You're so funny, you are!<eos> Mrs Hudson?<eos> He thinks you're clever.<eos> Poor old Sherlock.<eos> Always going on about you.
Why would I need that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe you'd like a drink sometime.<eos> Of what?<eos> Up to you.
You're...<eos> Nicer.<eos> Culverton gave me Faith's original note.<eos> A mutual friend put us in touch.<eos> Did Sherlock ever tell you about the note?
Help me.<eos> Hello.<eos> My name's Jim Moriarty.<eos> Welcome to the final problem.<eos> You know I could arrest you.
You are off course.<eos> Are you receiving?<eos> Golf, whisky, x-ray, you are off course.<eos> Are you receiving?<eos> Yeah, receiving you.
Sir.<eos> I'm sparing your blushes because we're supposed to be on the same side, and frankly, this is embarrassing.<eos> Doing a cavity search?<eos> The true art of disguise, according to your famous friend, is not being looked at.<eos> But I am looking at you, aren't I, Mr Holmes?
What dangers?<eos> Eurus doesn't just talk to people.<eos> She reprograms them.<eos> Anyone who spends time with her is automatically compromised.<eos> I'm only trying to help you.
- Shut up.<eos> Do you trust your wife? One question. That's your voice, isn't it?<eos> Do you trust her?<eos> You've got to stop saying these things.<eos> If Eurus has enslaved you, then who exactly is in charge of this prisoner?
That sort of thing.<eos> In return, however, she requires treats.<eos> - Last year it was a violin.<eos> - This year?<eos> Five minutes unsupervised conversation... With you.
- Not two people.<eos> Yes.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Hang on.<eos> What advantage did your moral code grant you?
Please continue with your deductions.<eos> I'm now focussing on the difference to your mental capacity a specified consequence can make.<eos> Why should we bother?<eos> What if we're disinclined to play your games, little sister?<eos> I have, if you remember, provided you with some motivation.
Just don't do it.<eos> It's very important.<eos> I can't say why. But I promise you, it is.<eos> I can't say that. I can't...<eos> I can't say that to you.
- No, I don't know why.<eos> Of course you do.<eos> Please, just say it.<eos> I can't.<eos> - Not to you.
- What?<eos> - Say it.<eos> Say it like you mean it.<eos> Final 30 seconds.<eos> I love you.
- Say it.<eos> Say it like you mean it.<eos> Final 30 seconds.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you.
Final 30 seconds.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you.<eos> Molly, please.<eos> I love you.
What happened? Did you run out of ideas?<eos> It's not empty, Sherlock.<eos> You've still got the gun, haven't you?<eos> I told you you'd need it, because only two can play the next game.<eos> Just two of you go on from here.
I was trying to be kind.<eos> Kind?<eos> Kind?<eos> You've told us that our daughter was dead.<eos> Better that than tell you what she had become. I'm sorry.
I was the luckiest kid ever.<eos> My parents even had cool jobs. They worked for the biggest pet company in the world...<eos> Puppy Co.<eos> - Yes, Mr. F rancis?<eos> - Puppy Co needs you.
You see, babies aren't getting as much love as we used to.<eos> Why?<eos> Have we been bad?<eos> No, Staci.<eos> But I'll tell you who is.
I'm launching my Forever Puppies, and there's nothing you can do about it!<eos> Baby Corp stole all the love from me... and now I'm going to take it back from them.<eos> You should understand what I'm talking about.<eos> You got replaced just like me!<eos> No! I'm nothing like you!
We're fine.<eos> You saved us.<eos> You're our hero.<eos> And a great big brother.<eos> We love you both so much.
But they're worth thousands of units apiece... which is why the Sovereign hired us to protect them.<eos> Careful what you say around these folks.<eos> They're easily offended.<eos> The cost of transgression is death.<eos> We thank you, Guardians, for putting your lives on the line.
My mother is from Earth.<eos> And your father?<eos> He ain't from Missouri.<eos> That's all I know.<eos> I see it within you.
Yes!<eos> Look at this!<eos> Where is the other half of our ship?<eos> My ship.<eos> Either one of you could have gotten us through that field... Had you flown with what's between your ears instead of what's between your legs!
You know I'm right, Kraglin.<eos> You best be very careful what you say about our captain.<eos> Who the hell is that?<eos> Yondu Udonta...<eos> I have a proposition for you.
Hey there, rat!<eos> How's it going, you blue idiot?<eos> Not so bad.<eos> We got ourselves a pretty good little gig here.<eos> This golden gal with quite a high opinion of herself... has offered us a large sum to deliver you and your pals over to her... because she wants to kill y'all.
There's too many of them.<eos> He needs my help.<eos> If you care about him... you need to get me out of these bonds.<eos> They are going to kill him!<eos> I tell you, it was pretty easy to find you.
That ain't right!<eos> I just gotta say it this one time, Captain.<eos> No matter how many times Quill betrays you... you protect him like none of the rest of us much matter!<eos> Yeah!<eos> I'm the one what sticks up for you!
I help him sleep.<eos> What were you about to say to Drax before I walked out?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Your quarters are this way.<eos> We deliver you to the Kree in the morning.
What were you about to say to Drax before I walked out?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Your quarters are this way.<eos> We deliver you to the Kree in the morning.<eos> Neither one of you will last much longer after that.
Ego will have won him to his side by now.<eos> - Then we just go.<eos> - No!<eos> - He's our friend.<eos> - All any of you do... is yell at each other. You are not friends.
I butchered that<eos> Then we're in Lyon for two nights or three?<eos> We can just leave that open.<eos> But there's some big old church that we've got to see, Basilica.<eos> You've reached Crystal Davis, sorry I missed you I'll call you back as soon as I can, bye bye, God bless.
Hey mom, it's me.<eos> Um, just trying you again.<eos> Um, they're guessing she's not going to make it through the night,<eos> but um... I will try you again later, bye.<eos> I'd like to thank you all for coming out here today.
Oh, anything you make is going to be great, don't want you worrying to much.<eos> And I got a turkey breast and sliced it and froze it,<eos> - Itineraries are?<eos> - In the scheduling folder.<eos> Mom, listen I got another call, yup we will see you then.
Mom, listen I got another call, yup we will see you then.<eos> Can't wait.<eos> We love you!<eos> - We love you Justin.<eos> - Love you.
- Oh, that's Justin's Daddy.<eos> He would be so proud of all that your building.<eos> He's just told me a little bit, he looks just like him.<eos> Yes.<eos> - Oh, this is for you.
Hi how are you, Heather?<eos> Hey!<eos> Well hello stranger, how are you?<eos> - How are you?<eos> - Good to see you.
Come here.<eos> Lauren this might be something good for you to do, - we could sell it together.<eos> - Yeah maybe so.<eos> No, you all could be a lot more generous than that with your pours, I got plenty.<eos> Excuse me, really good seeing you.
Thank God.<eos> I just wanna make sure we get a prayer in, before people start needing to leave.<eos> I know we've got bed times for some of our little ones.<eos> Also, I want to say how excited we are to welcome back a few of our own.<eos> Lauren, and Justin, and Carrie, it's also so great to have you.
Um, well it's really great to be back, miss seeing a lot of your faces some not so much.<eos> - Oh, he didn't mean that<eos> - I'm kidding, I'm kidding.<eos> So let's go ahead and pray before I make a fool of myself.<eos> We just want to thank you so much for this opportunity to come together friends and family, to just celebrate the day, and life, and...
But Justin, the labels.<eos> - They're already on their way...<eos> - Shhh, stop, stop.<eos> - The vent.<eos> She can hear you.
It's, uh, an idea.<eos> But then I could do paintings based on a whole collection.<eos> You know, it's Heartland, but it's like specific.<eos> Yeah?<eos> I mean, either of you have some time to come with me?
Jump, jump, jump.<eos> Hi there.<eos> You're a good dog.<eos> What the fuck are y'all doin' here?<eos> Um, do you care if my friend and I take a few pictures of you and your dogs?
- Oh, isn't that clever...<eos> I can't take credit for that, but Justin had a tree-house down at the lake,<eos> Their daddy put it up for them when they were little.<eos> You should make him show it to you while you're here.<eos> Has he shown you around it all?
- Yeah.<eos> It's getting hot.<eos> Oh, you should add visiting the tree-house to that list.<eos> Write down, "See Justin's tree-house,"<eos> and have him take you when he gets back.
We go way back.<eos> We kind of need to sort through the copyright issue - before Justin gets back.<eos> - Oh now?<eos> Oh, Okay.<eos> If it's Okay with you.
I didn't really mean to stay that long anyways<eos> I wanted to own my own shop.<eos> I was saving for it too, but this last year got pretty expensive.<eos> Do it, put that guy out of business.<eos> I'd do marketing for you.
You don't say shit about her, you hear me?<eos> You were happy to be off making your big important deals.<eos> You were too busy for us.<eos> Yes, I was busy.<eos> I told you I'd be busy.
yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm..<eos> I am Sorry.<eos> What scares you? - You.
Are you a transfer student?<eos> - Okay.<eos> Where are you from Gardner?<eos> - East Texas.<eos> - Don't think I have you on my roster.
Just to look better.<eos> This is the best place I've been so far.<eos> you ready?<eos> He's gonna love it.<eos> Can I help you?
You're my father.<eos> - Is this some kind of scam?<eos> - No no, he's not lying.<eos> it's the truth. I swear.<eos> I just wanted to meet you.
- Taking us into the stratosphere.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> - No worries.<eos> She can handle it.<eos> Although I warn you, one of you might need to take over.
Such a tightwad...<eos> Welcome. Hard climb?<eos> Good afternoon.<eos> Here, have some water.<eos> I thought a bunch of you were coming.
Nice to meet you.<eos> We're not terrorists!<eos> What?<eos> We don't like violence!<eos> We don't want to hurt you!
You don't even know if she can do anything but cry.<eos> Whereas I am loved... all over the world.<eos> Could you sit down and shut the fucking squeaking and whining?<eos> You know... You are forcing me...<eos> I'm forcing you to do what?
It's used on beef.<eos> I mean, live cows.<eos> To check their marbling.<eos> Hi, Dr. Johnny.<eos> Is Okja with you?
Man, this is so good, man. You gotta try this.<eos> It's actually really good.<eos> Good day, all.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> These are for you.
Fucking idiot.<eos> You look amazing!<eos> Oh, Johnny.<eos> You're skating on thin ice. Watch out you don't fall in and drown.<eos> Don't worry. I'm not here to put you to sleep with some corporate speech like my boring sister might have.
There it is!<eos> Hello, Lucy!<eos> Lucy, we love you!<eos> No.<eos> I'm here to introduce you to a real superstar.
It's gonna be big.<eos> Record-breaking.<eos> Lot of folks flying in from Midwest and Canada.<eos> Good.<eos> Let me introduce you to a new member.
Black people are rich.<eos> - You know what, no, I think we're not supposed to make wild assumptions about black people based upon whether or not we have stuff in our pockets.<eos> Yeah, that's... that's just...<eos> Don't make that assumption.<eos> But I'll tell you what, you know what the first thing I need to do is?
♪ Let's make a better guess ♪<eos> ♪ Let's hope we learned our lesson ♪<eos> ♪ And just pray for the best. ♪<eos> Well, Reverend, I see that you and the deacon are praying.<eos> I apologize about any inconvenience and just want to thank you again for all the work your parish has done with the police athletic league.
Not even close.<eos> It's incomplete.<eos> It's worse than sloppy.<eos> I wanted to see you to tell you that if you ever want to find work anyplace, then you better get your act together, do things properly, and start showing some respect for a possible future employer,<eos> because based on this shit, you'd never get hired here, and I would never recommend you for any work, anyplace.
Littlefield's legit.<eos> May I continue?<eos> Is that okay with you, Dougie?<eos> My friend?<eos> Close the door behind you... on your way out.
I-I haven't found any Indians.<eos> No, Andy.<eos> It's seven o'clock.<eos> Do you know where your freedom is?<eos> Coming to you live and electrified from studio A, high atop the escarpments of White Tail Peak, the roof...
Guess what.<eos> I've got one.<eos> Oh, yeah. And its beam, it penetrates the igneous rock of ignorance.<eos> It flips that rock over, and there they are, exposed, wriggling, squirming, crawling on their bellies like foul maggots, frantically racing back to the cover of darkness that they so crave.<eos> We're coming for you.

That toaster waffle, those muffins that frozen children's treat?<eos> Poison!<eos> Deadly poisons.<eos> That's what's there.<eos> And what's waiting for you?
But if it's real, we have to alert the FBI.<eos> I'm booking the flight.<eos> First class, Cindy.<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> I have to ask you to stop smoking.
Yes, I'll hold.<eos> - Is it him?<eos> - What?<eos> Is it him?<eos> Yes, I hear you.
All right, brother.<eos> Later.<eos> - But that's your truck.<eos> - I know it's my truck.<eos> I can't talk to you about this here. I told you.
How they got in my pajamas, I'll... I'll never know.<eos> Did you make a breakfast out of them?<eos> Panfried 'em right out there by the river.<eos> I had some scrambled eggs and... and an English muffin with huckleberry jam.<eos> Mighty good talking to you, Doc.
Panfried 'em right out there by the river.<eos> I had some scrambled eggs and... and an English muffin with huckleberry jam.<eos> Mighty good talking to you, Doc.<eos> I'll give your good wishes to Harry.<eos> Whatever this is about, well, I hope it turns out all right for you.
It's good to meet you.<eos> Detective. Thanks for seeing me.<eos> This shouldn't take long.<eos> You submitted a set of fingerprints a few days ago to our database, and we need to verify the source.<eos> Well, I can show them to you, but our search was blocked.
All right.<eos> You want Chantal to mess with him before I come?<eos> He'll sing for me.<eos> Whatever you want.<eos> Then I got a doubleheader for you in Vegas.
It's usually about money, Bushnell.<eos> Pure and simple.<eos> Nobody needs more reason than that.<eos> So what's his background?<eos> How long has he been with you?
Well... we appreciate you coming down, Bushnell.<eos> Well, I really appreciate your help.<eos> Damn strange business.<eos> First his car blows up, and then somebody tries to kill him.<eos> We'll get back to you as soon as we have something.
Got ya.<eos> Hey, Fuscos?<eos> Sergeant. Just in time.<eos> Prints and DNA, please.<eos> Hey, I was just coming to tell you that those palm prints came back off that gun.
This way.<eos> Fuckin' pansies.<eos> _<eos> Detective Macklay handled the case when it came in.<eos> He'll brief you on background.
I'm your new co-pilot. And I always come to work with a smile!<eos> - You should be terrified.<eos> Because I will be taking over the city.<eos> - What?<eos> - Batman will stop you.
- Who could choke-hold a bear?<eos> - Who never skips leg day? - Batman!<eos> Who always pays their taxes?<eos> Not Batman<eos> How is he beating all of you again?
You mean nothing to me.<eos> No one does.<eos> Batman! You did it!<eos> You're welcome.<eos> - Thank you, Batman. - Oh, my pleasure.
Oh! Alfred!<eos> I am so sorry.<eos> I have incredible reflexes.<eos> No, it's all my fault, sir.<eos> I should have known better than to sneak up on you like that.
Oh, this is great!<eos> Because all I want is to get adopted, so I can finally stop being alone.<eos> We've gathered here tonight to mark the retirement of Jim Gordon. Goodbye.<eos> And we wish him well on his South African jungle safari!<eos> Thank you. Now, to introduce you to his exciting new replacement.
Thank you. Along with Batman, of course.<eos> Whoo! Let's hear it for Batman!<eos> Who I wish was here right now.<eos> Oh, I'm sure he's listening.<eos> I'd like to ask all of you a question.
Are you fed up with crime?<eos> - Uh-huh. We're all tired of crime.<eos> - Yeah, we're sick of it.<eos> Then let's talk about real improvements that will end the cycle of crime.<eos> I've got a four-point pilot program that I'd love to share with you.
You can spend some quality time with your family.<eos> My...<eos> Okay, Batman. We'll take it from here.<eos> All right, listen up.<eos> All of you have the right to remain silent.
We are family - You and he have a lot in common.<eos> Hello, family photos.<eos> He lost his parents at a very young age.<eos> I've always wanted one of those.<eos> Doesn't he deserve a chance for someone to take him under their wing, as I took you under mine?
But with vulnerabilities.<eos> Who, me?<eos> No way.<eos> So, where do you keep all the other bad people in this place?<eos> They're standing right behind you.
- What?<eos> - You're boring. - He looks delicious.<eos> Let's eat this guy.<eos> Stop with the violence for just a second!<eos> What if I told you I could get you outta here?
Ha! The city needs me. Bang, bang, bang!<eos> Excuse me. Can you get the commissioner and show her this?<eos> - Batman. - Would you stop doing that?<eos> I sent the Bat-Fax.<eos> I hate to say this, but you're right. The city needs you.
- Sir!<eos> Watch out for those... - What are you doing?<eos> Okay. Everybody, timeout off.<eos> Whoo-hoo! I've been parented.<eos> - Batman, I can help you.
I never doubted you, bro.<eos> Actually, sir, Ms. Gordon saved him.<eos> Rope! You lied to me!<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> You mean, without you, Alfred would have been street meat?
- Yes!<eos> - And don't call me Dad.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Alfred, put that kid on the next jet to the orphanage.<eos> But doesn't he deserve a chance for someone to take him under their wing, as I took you under mine?
So, what do you say, Commish?<eos> Will you work with me?<eos> I need your help.<eos> I thought you'd never ask.<eos> I'm very, very proud of you, sir.
Yeah.<eos> please.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I used to ride my skateboard around in here.<eos> Someone will be right out to see you. thanks.
No.<eos> Can we finally talk?<eos> Okay. and I can touch one button and have a guard here.<eos> I'm not gonna hurt you.<eos> So... what makes you think Ward tried to kill you?
You move about as fast as a pig... swimming in gravy.<eos> I can't.<eos> I'll just end up crying.<eos> guys.<eos> These exercises are about trying to teach you so... do better.
Why don't you send one of your guys?<eos> one of my most trusted guys.<eos> Do this for me.<eos> How you feeling this morning?<eos> Drugs make me feel like I'm under water. but I understand that's what it takes with you.
Are you Colleen Wing?<eos> I am.<eos> I'm sorry to intrude.<eos> My name is Ward Meachum.<eos> What can I do for you?
put him on.<eos> Joy Meachum?<eos> This is Dr. Paul Edmonds from the Birch Psychiatric Hospital.<eos> I'm treating the patient your family admitted.<eos> how can I help you?
If you sign these... then...<eos> I will leave you this.<eos> 000?<eos> - You could do a lot with that.<eos> This must be very important to you.
I understand.<eos> just one last favor.<eos> What?<eos> Deliver these to Joy Meachum.<eos> Someone's here to see you.
She says she has a message from Danny.<eos> Show her in.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I got no clue what I'm doing here.<eos> Danny asked me to give this to you.
I insist.<eos> what are you so afraid of?<eos> You should be a little more like dad. Yeah?<eos> Grow some balls.<eos> I was just going to see you.
I'm gonna suggest that you have an anxiety disorder with psychotic features. because now it means we can make a plan for treatment.<eos> I don't want to make any false predictions.<eos> This... this will take time.<eos> you need to let me out of here.<eos> I can't release you now.
The guy who says he's Danny Rand?<eos> - He escaped from a mental...<eos> - There's nobody here but me.<eos> And I can take care of myself.<eos> - If he does try to contact you...
The new place with the glass floor?<eos> No, it's a... it's a dojo.<eos> - Has plastic mats. - Ah.<eos> Do you have any money for some new clothes?<eos> Because this homeless hipster thing isn't working for you.
Stay loose. Good. Good.<eos> Nice.<eos> Good, move, move, move!<eos> Keep it moving. Keep it moving.<eos> Don't let him get you. Don't let him get you.
It will go directly to your nephew.<eos> Tonight.<eos> How the hell did you manage this?<eos> Rand has many friends.<eos> We'd like to add you to that list.
Back up.<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> - Isn't it obvious?<eos> I'm not your sister, he's not your brother.<eos> We don't want you here.
I'm not your sister, he's not your brother.<eos> We don't want you here.<eos> Danny, listen... we can work this out, okay?<eos> I have Hogarth now.<eos> We're coming for you.
Well done!<eos> All right! How do you think of this guy, huh?<eos> How about some respect?<eos> Well done!<eos> Now, I told you it was gonna be a great night, didn't I?
Cut the Floyd Mayweather shit.<eos> This is a...<eos> The Daughter of the Dragon!<eos> I don't know where you came from, but you're welcome anytime.<eos> Good to see you again, Jeri.
This doesn't prove anything.<eos> Anybody could have made this.<eos> Look closely.<eos> There is a child's fingerprint in the unfinished part of the clay, right next to Joy's name.<eos> I assure you... it is an exact match.
That is immaterial.<eos> You know that it will hold up in court.<eos> It proves Danny's identity, and that is all we need.<eos> Fine.<eos> I will bury you in motions and delays, discovery and depositions, and he will not see a dime for at least ten years, maybe longer.
I like it.<eos> Come on.<eos> Thank you all for coming out on this momentous occasion as Rand Enterprises welcomes Danny Rand to his rightful place in the company that bears his name.<eos> Danny will continue the legacy of his father, Wendell, and join us in guiding this great company into the future.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you, Danny Rand.
Listen, don't give the front page to Karen. I've got a hell of a story for tomorrow.<eos> - What happened to you? - What happened to you?<eos> That's why I'm here.<eos> Hey, can you, uh... Can you keep an eye on Joy for me?<eos> Wasn't he stalking you?
It's a front for the Yangshi Gongsi, the Yang Clan Company.<eos> - I need to have a word with them.<eos> - Are you kidding me?<eos> Why do you wanna mess around with Triads?<eos> Hello, can I help you?
She's lucky she has such a talented bodyguard.<eos> She's fine now.<eos> Could this good and faithful servant ask for one more favor?<eos> What do you want?<eos> Which one of you hit Joy Meachum?
I wanna tell you about this great new product.
And you've figured all of this out because some Chinese dude left a box at your door?<eos> Yes.<eos> No.<eos> - But Harold...<eos> - That's between the two of you.
Thank you.<eos> To the precious Buddha, the unsurpassable teacher.<eos> To the precious dharma, the unsurpassable protection.<eos> To the precious sangha, the unsurpassable guides.<eos> To you three rare and supreme sources of refuge, I offer.
Radovan, the chemist.<eos> I'm Danny.<eos> You're coming with me.<eos> No.<eos> Leave me, I beg of you.
But this?<eos> I've been training my whole life for this.<eos> This is the one thing I know I can do better than anyone else.<eos> I am the only one who can defeat them.<eos> God! My mother says I can't escape meeting people like you.
I don't want a hospital.<eos> - Mr. Radovan...<eos> - I... I want my daughter.<eos> Danny's taking care of that.<eos> Right now, we need to take care of you.
I know.<eos> You're right.<eos> The Hand was a myth drummed into me.<eos> I'd never met them face-to-face.<eos> You're saying I have more experience fighting the Hand than you?
I hurt it.<eos> Looks like it.<eos> Car door. I'm such an idiot.<eos> Why don't you have a seat?<eos> We'll be with you as soon as we can.
And now, an immortal weapon has left K'un-Lun, not to fulfill his duty, but in dereliction of it.<eos> History says that the Iron Fist and the Hand are mortal enemies.<eos> But I wonder... in the spirit of change, perhaps we can be something different.<eos> Last night showed me the truth.<eos> K'un-Lun did not send you to hunt us down.
We should brighten up this office, yes?<eos> I'll put in an order for some lamps.<eos> Come.<eos> You shouldn't be here.<eos> Why, Mr. Rand, I have a mind to report you to HR.
Mmm, I am aware.<eos> Believe me.<eos> For now, keep doing as you are.<eos> I'll be in touch.<eos> What happened to you?
Karen Page at The Bulletin seemed to like it.<eos> What?<eos> You already went to the press?<eos> She seems to think it's gonna make front page tomorrow.<eos> Listen. I know this isn't what you wanted. Any of you.
I'll give you that.<eos> But the Hand is legion.<eos> Why attack now?<eos> Why do you think you can even the odds against our enemies?<eos> Because I have heard Madame Gao's plans for you.
Because I have heard Madame Gao's plans for you.<eos> And if you do nothing, you'll all be dead by the end of the week.<eos> You don't know me... but the Hand does.<eos> And they fear me.<eos> With you and your men by our side... they'll fear you, too.
Radovan!<eos> Sabina...<eos> Sabina's fine. She's home.<eos> She's safe.<eos> We're gonna get you out of here.
Well, there is no rest of your life if she kills you.<eos> I've seen someone else take on the Hand.<eos> It didn't end well.<eos> I appreciate your concern, but I've already made up my mind.<eos> I'm sorry I dragged you both into my fight, but, hopefully, this trip will end the Hand's story in all of our lives.
We have a new espresso machine.<eos> Cut the theatrics, Lawrence.<eos> Let's get this over with so we can pack our offices.<eos> Oh, your things have already been packed... uh, minus any Rand property, of course.<eos> The boxes will be released to you as soon as you sign your termination agreements.
Thirty million dollars.<eos> I'll sign right now.<eos> You never have to see my face again.<eos> I realize... that you will have to eat some crow... with the rest of the board.<eos> So... I would be willing to compensate you for that.
No.<eos> I'm talking about you and your sister working against each other.<eos> And over what, huh?<eos> A little money?<eos> I always thought the two of you looked after one another.
I just...<eos> - I lost. I...<eos> - Anger is a gift, Mr. Rand, if you know how to control it.<eos> It would be my privilege to teach you.<eos> I don't wanna hurt you.
- I lost. I...<eos> - Anger is a gift, Mr. Rand, if you know how to control it.<eos> It would be my privilege to teach you.<eos> I don't wanna hurt you.<eos> I just want to know what happened between you and my father.
- Anger is a gift, Mr. Rand, if you know how to control it.<eos> It would be my privilege to teach you.<eos> I don't wanna hurt you.<eos> I just want to know what happened between you and my father.<eos> Is that what's driven you to this state?
I'll die before I let you touch them.<eos> I'm afraid I can't allow you to do that just yet, Mr. Rand.<eos> Kill the women.<eos> I just want you guys to know...<eos> I wish I'd never come to China with you.
Yeah. Yeah, I'm just tired.<eos> What do you think?<eos> It's better than torture.<eos> Hey! What's your problem?<eos> Hey, I'm talking to you.
Searching for your destiny.<eos> But it's selfish of you to involve Danny in your quest.<eos> He has greater problems to deal with.<eos> If you were going to be special, it would have already happened.<eos> The only thing that can come out of this for you is sorrow, heartbreak, and pain.
I need your help.<eos> Oh, I don't know about that.<eos> I really like my job, Mr. Rand.<eos> I need this job.<eos> I'm sorry to put you in this position, but it's really important.
I know the burden you carry.<eos> A woman in this world.<eos> You are consistently underestimated.<eos> Last... warning.<eos> Your grandfather was right to train you the way he did.
So what?<eos> That's a saying anyone in Japan would know.<eos> It was printed in his obituary.<eos> You could have looked that up.<eos> He spoke it to you many times.
- Amazing.<eos> - Thank you, sir.<eos> That wasn't a compliment.<eos> Orders around the front.<eos> Can I help you?
- Shut up!<eos> - Voice mail.<eos> Hi, this is a friend of Colleen's.<eos> Uh, she's... she's been poisoned.<eos> She's asking for you.
- Mr. Meachum, you didn't...<eos> - Oh, please... call me Harold.<eos> Now, I think...<eos> I think I'm gonna have this organic cornflakes one.<eos> In all the time I've worked for you, I don't think I've ever seen you eat any dairy or sugar.
So I'm damned if I do and damned if I don't.<eos> That's how he works.<eos> Then what do you suggest we do?<eos> You just let me out of here.<eos> I will take you to him.
Where are you taking him?<eos> Colleen, what's going on?<eos> We're helping him.<eos> Trust me.<eos> I'm going with you.
What?<eos> Death?<eos> It was like when I was a kid... coming home from school through the snow, and... and then I'd be standing on the porch, freezing, and on the other side was comfort.<eos> But this time... This time when I tried the handle, the door wouldn't open.<eos> And I could hear you.
- I bet I could take you now.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> You think?<eos> See?<eos> I told you.
Then you ran towards slavery as fast as you could.<eos> You're an idiot.<eos> Really?<eos> Now you're baiting me with insults?<eos> I am treating you with respect by being who I truly am.
You're an idiot.<eos> Really?<eos> Now you're baiting me with insults?<eos> I am treating you with respect by being who I truly am.<eos> Not everyone around you does the same.
I am treating you with respect by being who I truly am.<eos> Not everyone around you does the same.<eos> That's not true!<eos> They are stealing your ability to trust.<eos> That is how they crush you.
Sorry to interrupt your dinner, but, please eat.<eos> I... I don't mind.<eos> My name is Bakuto.<eos> I'll be taking over from Madame Gao.<eos> Danny told you about me.
Everything that is Gao's is now mine.<eos> You proceed as you have but with a different goal.<eos> And what would that be?<eos> A way out.<eos> A return to public life for you.
He always does.<eos> Where's Danny?<eos> He went up to your roof for his meditations.<eos> He needs to restore his chi so he can summon the Iron Fist for our battle with the Hand.<eos> He told me to watch over you.
Well, as long as you're watching, are you hungry?<eos> I ordered pizza.<eos> What passes for food in this world is poison for both the body and soul.<eos> I guess you guys don't order a lot of delivery in K'un-Lun.<eos> - How much has Danny told you of K'un-Lun?
I'll make him. If I have to.<eos> Uh, it's... just the pizza.<eos> You know what?<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> I should go with you.
Uh, it's... just the pizza.<eos> You know what?<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> I should go with you.<eos> You know, it's hard enough being a delivery guy without a warrior monk accidently kicking the crap out of you.
- Though, I'm no friend of Gao's.<eos> - What do you want?<eos> I want to be your friend.<eos> I can get help you get out of here. And most importantly,<eos> I can free you from your father.
I want you in charge, because Harold has become...<eos> - Goddamn dangerous.<eos> - He can't be trusted.<eos> Our relationship would be more quid pro quo.<eos> Take this drug I'm giving you now, for instance.
And you're saying you would share this with Rand?<eos> All of this and freedom from your father forever.<eos> It sounds good, no?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Good. I do have an immediate favor to ask of you.
- Can Joy and I leave now?<eos> Come, sit over here.<eos> You weren't really gonna have Dad killed, right?<eos> You poor people are such a mess.<eos> I know a good family therapist that could help, should any of you survive the night.
You weren't really gonna have Dad killed, right?<eos> You poor people are such a mess.<eos> I know a good family therapist that could help, should any of you survive the night.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> I'm gonna come back for you, Bakuto.
Danny said he's coming.<eos> He will.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Two minutes to go.<eos> Maybe Danny's figured, with all of you out of the way, he'll be in charge of Rand.
Danny made a poor decision when he attacked the DEA agents.<eos> His life is in danger.<eos> Unfortunately, I haven't had any contact with him.<eos> Good morning.<eos> May I help you?
But maybe we shouldn't contact her directly.<eos> We don't know where the DEA's eyes are.<eos> We need a messenger.<eos> I was asked to give you something.<eos> A client needs you.
A client needs you.<eos> $5 will get you exactly two seconds of my time.<eos> Please, take it.<eos> "J-Money."<eos> I can take you to him.
Please, take it.<eos> "J-Money."<eos> I can take you to him.<eos> Look who I found.<eos> As an officer of the court, I'm obliged to tell you to turn yourself in.
I'm sorry, who are you?<eos> Colleen Wing.<eos> Oh, wonderful.<eos> Another fugitive from the law.<eos> The DEA considers both of you armed and dangerous.
I don't know.<eos> There's so much I don't know.<eos> Here it is.<eos> Gao?<eos> They left you here?
- Are you sure?<eos> - The Meachums, but...<eos> - But what?<eos> Harold was my father's best friend. He would never...<eos> He seems to have no problem hurting you now.
But when your father was about to discover all this, Harold feared that he would ruin everything.<eos> I still remember the moment when he came to me and asked for poison.<eos> He seemed very enthused by the idea.<eos> You will only gain the strength of a real Iron Fist after you have killed Harold. You must rid yourself of this anger.<eos> You have two doors ahead of you, Danny Rand.
- What?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Those who walk through that door are never heard from again.<eos> Let's go. Let's go.<eos> Let's hope your minions find you before you rot.
No.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Danny, Ward.<eos> I was told I'd find you here.<eos> We could have met you at the office.
In light of the fact that you were set up and are going to be making a very generous contribution to the DEA's Widows' and Children's Fund, they are dropping all the charges, including the assault against their officers.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> - Now what?<eos> - Don't know.<eos> Up to you.
Things changed for me.<eos> And you know that if you have any hope of returning to your old life, he must be removed.<eos> Removed?<eos> Killed.<eos> I can help you with that.
Enough of this!<eos> Do you people know why we Scouts have shed so much blood? !<eos> To take back our freedom from the Titans!<eos> I was willing to sacrifice my own life for that cause!<eos> I'm not asking you to talk, I'm ordering you.
And... so does Conny!<eos> Conny? !<eos> My village...<eos> My village is to the south where the Titans are coming from.<eos> I can take you to the nearby villages.
Yes, we received your payment.<eos> No, it wasn't late, but it was for 78.13, and the bill was for 78.31.<eos> Okay. Great.<eos> No, thank you.
Jared will be doing your training.<eos> I oversee the team, and Jared oversees the unit.<eos> As you know, you'll be doing straight up customer maintenance for the smaller advertisers.<eos> You work in your portable here.<eos> It's gonna match the customer experience, and it gets routed over to one of you.
Okay?<eos> Believe me, you're doing fine.<eos> You're good, all right? Hello, I'm eamon Bailey.<eos> Thank you, thank you.<eos> So glad to see you all here.
- Right. That's you.<eos> Get up. - Come on, guppies, just stand up.<eos> Guppies, stand up, come on.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Nice to have you. Now, now, guppies is just an affectionate term for you baby fishies. Soon, you will all grow to become powerful...
Almost useless, right?<eos> But now, let's refresh that page and show the site with our new circle video delivery.<eos> Now that looks pretty good, doesn't it?<eos> Yeah, maybe I should be out there right now.<eos> But would it surprise you to know that this is not coming from some big camera, but actually just one of these?
Here's traffic on the 101.<eos> Oh, did you think this was just a camera?<eos> No. Welcome to real-time analytic processing.<eos> When you see this, you're also getting this.<eos> Air quality, traffic volume, weather patterns, biometrics, facial recognition, saved and searchable, all to serve you better.
This is so great!<eos> Your dad's gonna call you later, okay?<eos> Okay, I gotta go. Big event here on campus.<eos> - Exciting.<eos> - I know. - Love you! - I love you too.
Our government, not so much.<eos> We expect openness, and we get obfuscation.<eos> We get doublespeak.<eos> I mean, no wonder congress's approval rating is currently at 11%.<eos> Now, I'm sure a lot of you have heard about a certain senator who, it was revealed, has been involved in some... Very unsavory business.
Without secrets, without the hoarding of knowledge and information, we can finally realize our potential.<eos> This is a special dream Friday.<eos> I thought I'd change it up a bit today and not have a speech, but an interview.<eos> I had a conversation with a young circler the other day that I wanted to share with you.<eos> I've asked Mae Holland, who some of you might know is one of our new guppies in customer experience, to join me today.
We match.<eos> - We sure do.<eos> - These are great.<eos> - Very stylish.<eos> I love you guys. I'll see you later.
You can trust me there.<eos> this is me brushing my teeth.<eos> If you're enjoying this, I'm worried about you.<eos> Good night, everyone.<eos> I'm not gonna lie, it was a crazy day, but I'm happy I had you with me, each and every one of you.
So, here's how many people voted in the last national election.<eos> Here's how many were eligible to vote.<eos> And here's how many Americans are registered in the circle.<eos> And there's that guy.<eos> So, now we get down to the meat of today's session, something we've discussed with congresswoman Santos and others-- what if your circle profile automatically registered you to vote?
We're sorry, but we can't keep doing this.<eos> Lt's-- it's more than we ever-- you know, we love you and we don't want to- love you, love you- we have to have our privacy.<eos> And we're worried you don't realize what you've gotten yourself into.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I didn't mean to hurt you. - It's not you.
I'm so sorry.<eos> I didn't mean to hurt you. - It's not you.<eos> - Oh, we know that. - It's us, we...<eos> - Yeah, it's us. ...just need you to understand that.<eos> - I love you.
When someone dies in a plane crash, you don't abandon planes. - You make them safer.<eos> - Mae-Mae, at least wait a bit.<eos> I'm the only one who can do this.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I love you.
Hmm? I said how much I was looking forward to seeing her.<eos> My name is Rainaldi.<eos> I am your cousin's lawyer and advisor, and I hope friend.<eos> A copy of the certificate of death.<eos> A copy has already been sent to you in England and another one to the trustee of Ambrose's will, your godfather, Signor Kendall.
- No, no, no.<eos> Not at all.<eos> - I quite understand.<eos> - No, I am sorry.<eos> And thank you... for everything... for the flowers and offering to stay.
What else do you think we talked about?<eos> Clearly I have no idea.<eos> All this was his passion.<eos> So I made it my passion too.<eos> Everyone will be gawping at you.
Our femininity:<eos> Mrs. Pascoe's and mine.<eos> God knows.<eos> All I know is...<eos> I like looking at you... and I don't like looking at Mrs. Pascoe.
I'm surprised the Pascoe girls didn't remark on it.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Well, the Pascoe girls were probably far too busy remarking on something else.<eos> What?<eos> How easy it must be for a woman like your cousin Rachel to twist you around her little finger.
It's Italian tea, infusions made from these herbs.<eos> Here, try.<eos> Try.<eos> It's, um, disgusting.<eos> It's good for you.
I did nothing of the sort.<eos> If you had set out to humiliate me, Philip, you really couldn't have got off to a better start!<eos> - Why?<eos> - Why?<eos> Because now it looks as if I came begging to you!
If Ambrose hadn't been such an idiot, this place would have been your home.<eos> I think I'm the idiot.<eos> I thought coming here would bring him back to life.<eos> I don't know why you came.<eos> I don't know anything about you.
Hurry up.<eos> This is a tisana made with fennel and rose hips.<eos> All together... it's going to make you better.<eos> They'll think you're a witch.<eos> Or worse, they'll call for you in the middle of the night to deliver babies.
Is it simply their destiny to do so?<eos> I've never thought about it.<eos> No, of course you haven't.<eos> You know nothing about women.<eos> I do hope I haven't said anything to hurt you.
You had no right to take that necklace.<eos> It's mine and it's from the estate.<eos> The estate is not yet yours, as you well know.<eos> What of it? It will be soon.<eos> I must ask you to desire her to return the collar.
What of it? It will be soon.<eos> I must ask you to desire her to return the collar.<eos> Really?<eos> Well, that's the last thing in the world I intend to do.<eos> Then I must do it for you.
There.<eos> - You'll regret this.<eos> - Be quiet. You're a fool.<eos> Thank you for a delightful and successful evening, Philip.<eos> Let's hope the dancing doesn't keep you awake all night.
That's why I was so proud and happy to wear them.<eos> Had I been married here and not in Italy, I should have worn them too.<eos> Don't be sad.<eos> Happy Christmas, dear, dear Philip.<eos> We must go back to the party because the guests are waiting for you.
There doesn't appear to be any proviso should Mrs. Ashley marry again.<eos> That's not likely to happen.<eos> But the point should be covered, should it not?<eos> If you insist.<eos> In case of marriage, her property should revert to you.
- Is she here?<eos> - Yes, I think so.<eos> - I think I should...<eos> Why don't you ride over tomorrow?<eos> The two of you?
Damn near went in after it.<eos> Rachel.<eos> Rachel.<eos> - What is it?<eos> - I've got something for you.
- Well, didn't you?<eos> You know I did.<eos> Good.<eos> I wanted you to enjoy it.<eos> - I wanted to thank you.
- Let go of my arm.<eos> - Kiss me.<eos> - Kiss me, please.<eos> - Let go of me.<eos> I've been worried about you for so long.
Since before Christmas.<eos> You know nothing about her.<eos> Or is it you who know nothing?<eos> It's no use.<eos> I'm fond of you and you of me, but if we keep on talking, we'll end up hating each other.
And wasted no time in driving over to see us.<eos> She said she didn't fully understand it.<eos> Well, she understood it pretty damn well by the time she left.<eos> We stood on the steps in the sunshine waiting for her carriage and my father said to her,<eos> "The marriage clause may strike you as a little hard.
That clause is to protect the estate.<eos> If she were my wife... of course it wouldn't apply.<eos> No.<eos> No, you're wrong.<eos> If she marries you, or anyone else, then everything, the house, everything, reverts to you.
I invited Mary Pascoe to stay in the house with me, as my companion.<eos> I do hope you approve.<eos> Do you play?<eos> It's cribbage.<eos> - Can I speak to you?
Yes, certainly, Mrs. Ashley.<eos> - Don't do that.<eos> - Do what?<eos> Don't close the door.<eos> After last night, I cannot be alone with you.
- Do what?<eos> Don't close the door.<eos> After last night, I cannot be alone with you.<eos> Please don't do this.<eos> I don't feel safe with you.
- What for?<eos> - Not your business.<eos> How long have you been lying to me?<eos> You hate him.<eos> If I'd told you he was here, it would have made you sick again.
Come on, boy.<eos> Night, John.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> I'd like to see the manager.<eos> How good to see you again so soon, Mr. Wick.
Night, John.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> I'd like to see the manager.<eos> How good to see you again so soon, Mr. Wick.<eos> Shall I announce you?
How good to see you again so soon, Mr. Wick.<eos> Shall I announce you?<eos> Yes, please.<eos> Stay.<eos> Mr. Wick is on his way to see you, sir.
59, 0, 3.5.<eos> Jonathan!<eos> Julius.<eos> Ciao.<eos> Nice to see you.
Yeah...<eos> You're not having a good night, are you, John?<eos> Gentlemen!<eos> Gentlemen!<eos> Do I need to remind you, that there will be no business conducted on the Continental grounds?
Operator.<eos> How may I direct your call?<eos> Accounts payable.<eos> One moment, please.<eos> Accounts payable. How may I help you?
Processing. Please hold.<eos> I appreciate the service.<eos> My pleasure.<eos> You will find safe passage below.<eos> Transportation is waiting for you.
Now he's free of the marker, what do you think he'll do?<eos> He had a glimpse of the other side, and he embraced it.<eos> But you, Signor D'Antonio... took it away from him.<eos> He was already back.<eos> Oh, he came back for love, not for you.
Oh, he came back for love, not for you.<eos> He owed me.<eos> I had every right.<eos> And now, he's coming again.<eos> He did tell you not to do this.
He owed me.<eos> I had every right.<eos> And now, he's coming again.<eos> He did tell you not to do this.<eos> He did warn you.
You, and you with me.<eos> You go.<eos> Welcome to Reflections of the Soul at the New Modern NYC.<eos> Within this exhibition, the interplay of light and the nature of self-images coalesce to provide an experience which will highlight the fragility of our perception of space and our place within it.<eos> We hope through this exhibit we can provide new insights into your understanding of the world, and just possibly lead you to deeper reflection into the nature of self.
All right.<eos> Then enjoy your kingdom Winston, while you still can.<eos> And you, its privileges, sir.<eos> I'm here to see Santino D'Antonio.<eos> He's waiting for you in the lounge, sir.
That's what your father wanted and that's why he signed the estate over to him.<eos> Plain and simple, you owe the bank just north of, $6 million.<eos> $6 million!<eos> All money borrowed against the ranch to keep it afloat.<eos> But in 90 days, the probate process is going to catch up with you and the bank's gonna want this house to cover the debt.
I need to know everything about my husband's business, it's my business.<eos> I need to know what he did right, what he did wrong and what around here is worth saving!<eos> - Now? - Right now.<eos> We lease this back pasture to a dairy farm for grazing, it brings in a little.<eos> Most of the workers have found jobs elsewhere, a handful have stayed loyal to you.
- They're suffering.<eos> - I know and it's awful, but that's the way things are, the law won't allow it.<eos> I have done what other people have told me to do my entire life.<eos> Can you give me a hand?<eos> I told you, ma'am, I've no interest in breaking any laws.
I told you, ma'am, I've no interest in breaking any laws.<eos> You know what, that's enough with the ma'am stuff, my name is Stella, okay?<eos> And I, Stella, would love your help.<eos> Please, okay?<eos> I won't turn you in, okay?
You gotta cover every inch of the place.<eos> Twenty-four hour recorded feed. - Got it.<eos> - Twenty-four hours?<eos> The prison rehabilitation equine program works mostly with inmates incarcerated for non-violent reasons. Drugs, theft, fraud.<eos> They're more likely to hack into your computer, than hack you to pieces.
Twenty-four hour recorded feed. - Got it.<eos> - Twenty-four hours?<eos> The prison rehabilitation equine program works mostly with inmates incarcerated for non-violent reasons. Drugs, theft, fraud.<eos> They're more likely to hack into your computer, than hack you to pieces.<eos> Still, we gotta cover ourselves for liability to protect you and us both.
Look, animal assisted programs lower recidivism rates, they teach the inmates nurturing and compassion and give them some valuable work skills.<eos> That's our objective, miss Davis, not saving your ass.<eos> All right, well, the good news, miss Davis, is you've got a prep graduate right here running the show and he cared enough to call in a big favor for ya, so...<eos> You implement all these security measures and I will see what i can do about freeing up the state funds for you as fast as I can, okay?<eos> - Good seeing you, holt. - You too, buddy.
Let's go, everybody out!<eos> Miss Davis.<eos> - Bratt. - Holt.<eos> So, what you got for me?<eos> Well, let me walk you through these guys.
Scottish.<eos> It's Irish if I say it's Irish and if you can't listen to me, you can't hear what these horses have to say and that makes you no damn good to me.<eos> - Got it?<eos> - Got it.<eos> But first you're gonna do chores to get them used to you.
Listen, I don't want to get in the middle of anything,<eos> I'm just trying to save my ranch.<eos> Yeah, by exploiting wild animals.<eos> You should have seen them when they broke through the fence to get onto my property, they were starving.<eos> I guess they were so lucky that they found you.
So come on down to rich east, to our free car wash which is open 'til 5pm.<eos> And learn something about these free wild horses held in captivity.<eos> Let's get the word out.<eos> Thank you, Meredith.<eos> Now back to you in the studio.
I think you guys should head out back.<eos> We've had enough fireworks for the day.<eos> Hell of a day.<eos> How many more days of this do we have?<eos> For you, 21.
I am so underfunded and understaffed.<eos> - And yet here you are.<eos> - Yeah. I was told that some of the horses were burned alive, and one of the inmates is a convicted arsonist.<eos> The horses are fine. They're right over there in that corral.<eos> I believe you, Ms. Davis, but unfortunately some folks above my pay grade feel that these horses are unsafe.
So you're gonna take these horses away so they can spend the rest of their lives stacked on top of each other? Because of bullshit allegations whispered into a politician's ear.<eos> I have orders.<eos> These men may spend the night in jail. There may be guards all over the place. But when they're with these horses, they are free.<eos> And you're gonna take that away from them.<eos> I promise you, I promise you, these men would never hurt the horses.
That's it.<eos> Oh, you.<eos> I want so much for you to feel better.<eos> Hey, Ms. Stella.<eos> Could I talk to you for a minute?
Thank you.<eos> It's the best present anyone's ever gotten me.<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> - To see Stella.<eos> I don't think she's gonna want to talk to you.
Hey!<eos> Get off my ranch!<eos> I come in peace.<eos> No cameras, no press, it's just me.<eos> I have nothing to say to you.
I would like to adopt your horses, all of them, and set them free on my property.<eos> It would complete your prison program.<eos> I can re-frame all of this.<eos> "Stella the grieving widow sets her horses free."<eos> Cameras flash, I forgive you, everybody loves you, they already love me.
Oh, no, ma'am.<eos> You get to keep the ranch and save your ass, I'm happy for you.<eos> - I haven't said yes yet.<eos> - Why the hell not?<eos> I told you I needed 24 hours, i wanted to talk to you first.
It rehabilitates the convicts and gets the horses healthy and ready for adoption.<eos> So they all get a second chance.<eos> What I have seen in the last 90 days on my ranch has been magical, and I'm more proud of that than anything I have ever done in my entire life.<eos> So our horses will be auctioned off this weekend at the usa qha regionals.<eos> If any of you are interested in adopting, but let me warn you, they are gorgeous.
What are you doing here?<eos> They're tracks, they definitely came this way.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Mrs. Stella, that woman was here.<eos> She wanted to talk to you.
Come on!<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> - Get off!<eos> Hey, don't be afraid.<eos> I would never hurt you more than it hurt him.
The auction's not 'til 2pm tomorrow.<eos> We'll get up at crack of dawn and start again.<eos> You're not gonna sleep?<eos> Oh, no, I'm okay.<eos> I just wanna thank you for everything, bratt.
You get this one, I'll go after the other.<eos> Don't come up here, Stella.<eos> You don't want to see this.<eos> Howdy, folks!<eos> All of you here for the horse auction, come on in.
May I?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hello, I'm Stella Davis,<eos> I'm the owner of the double diamond ranch.<eos> I just felt I needed to come up here and remind you that these noble creatures helped build our country.
Good luck with your continued work.<eos> - Congratulations.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> You've got a great horse here in old buster.<eos> He'll do it for you.
Oh, I'll be okay until Monday.<eos> You know, maybe I'll just check and see if the hens...<eos> Oh, everything's fine, no, go see your son.<eos> You're a good man, bratt.<eos> Your son's gonna love you.
Thank you.<eos> Don't let this place burn down without me.<eos> No chance, brother.<eos> Hey, Jon.<eos> They're ready for you now, Ms. Stella.
Good morning, Mr. Hyde.<eos> Ana, please, it's Jack.<eos> Tea, right?<eos> Weak, black.<eos> I'm pretty sure I'm supposed to get this for you, but thank you, Jack.
Have you heard from Christian?<eos> Yeah.<eos> He sent me flowers.<eos> To wish me luck.<eos> Sweetheart, are you ever gonna tell me what happened between you?
It's not what he wants anymore.<eos> But it's what he needs.<eos> And you don't strike me as the type of woman who wants to be owned.<eos> If you really wanna make him happy, if you wanna be happy, you'll let him go.<eos> There's no way that someone like you could ever understand what we have.
It's crazy, isn't it?<eos> Night, Ana.<eos> Good night, Hannah.<eos> You leaving?<eos> Um, I was actually just about to come talk to you.
He'll get tired of me.<eos> Master sleeps in your bed.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I saw you.<eos> I watched you.
Come on, let's go.<eos> For more on this breaking story, let's go out to the field and our reporter, Rachel Taylor.<eos> Rachel?<eos> Thank you, John.<eos> I'm speaking to you live from the private helicopter terminal at Seattle...
You're going to have plenty of time.<eos> We're so glad that you're here with us and in Christian's life.<eos> You've made such a difference to him.<eos> He never let anyone get close until you came along.<eos> Grace, he adores you.
Surely.<eos> She's fantastic.<eos> Ladies, gentlemen.<eos> Mia.<eos> I wanna thank you all for coming here this evening.
I wanna thank you all for coming here this evening.<eos> I was expecting a small family gathering.<eos> Thanks, Mia.<eos> But I'm happy that you're all here because I have an announcement to make.<eos> As most of you know, yesterday ros and I had a narrow escape.
I'm sorry to interrupt.<eos> Mia wants to taste one of your killer cocktails.<eos> Oh, well, coming right up.<eos> I see you heeded our little talk.<eos> What makes you think i would ever listen to you?
What makes you think i would ever listen to you?<eos> You don't care about Christian.<eos> He'll see that.<eos> I'll make sure of it.<eos> He'll see right through you.
You don't care about Christian.<eos> He'll see that.<eos> I'll make sure of it.<eos> He'll see right through you.<eos> It's over for you, Elena.
-Did you see that girl?<eos> -We can't not go in there.<eos> -Oh, boy.<eos> Put me down!<eos> I'm sorry to bother you, sir, but she was heading towards the desert.
-No big deal.<eos> This pretty green in the sand, I can spot it from miles away.<eos> Hey, don't you have an oasis to watch?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I'll leave you with your family.
No, no.<eos> Not at all.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> All right, so you're gonna go slither a little more over that way, please.<eos> Thank you, officer.
I'm sorry, what?<eos> You think that just anybody can get into Miss Rita's ballet company?<eos> -Oh, so it's "Miss Rita's ballet company".<eos> -Precisely.<eos> Who made dancers out of you?
- Oh, I love your voice.<eos> - Okay, enough babbling.<eos> Time?<eos> Time for what?<eos> I can't tell you to break a leg, right?
- It was stronger than me.<eos> That music, I couldn't fight it.<eos> And you even loved it, didn't you?<eos> You're done, girl, just like the rest of us.<eos> I don't know about you but I'd love a little break, like, a pollen break.
Shh!<eos> Hm?<eos> Great. Bugs.<eos> Welcome, strangers.<eos> May the light be with you.
I don't believe I've met your friend over there.<eos> Yeah. Um...<eos> Ajar, this is Emily.<eos> Emily, this is--<eos> Oh, Pitt told me so much about you.
My name's Ellie.<eos> I'm a detective with Wessex Police.<eos> You called about an attack.<eos> A sexual attack.<eos> We'd like to take you somewhere we can talk.
Trish, hello.<eos> My name's Anna.<eos> I'm a crisis worker here at the SARC.<eos> This is a dedicated Sexual Assault Referral Centre.<eos> I'm going to be with you all the time you're here, to make sure you understand everything that's happening.
I'm a crisis worker here at the SARC.<eos> This is a dedicated Sexual Assault Referral Centre.<eos> I'm going to be with you all the time you're here, to make sure you understand everything that's happening.<eos> If you're feeling unsafe or uncomfortable, in any way, we will stop.<eos> Everyone will be led by you.
We don't know it was, until we get more information.<eos> We can't know if she knew her attacker or not.<eos> I'm not saying it is, I'm asking when the last one was.<eos> Well, not in my career.<eos> I'm going to refer you on to Wessex Rape Response.
I'm going to refer you on to Wessex Rape Response.<eos> They'll allocate an Independent Sexual Violence Advisor who should be in touch within 24 hours.<eos> Karen can prescribe the morning after pill, if you think that might be appropriate.<eos> We'll also make you a sexual health clinic appointment.<eos> I'm going to hand you back to the police now, Trish.
I'm going to hand you back to the police now, Trish.<eos> I just need you to know there's a lot of support for what you're going through.<eos> There are people who will look after you, help you and guide you.<eos> You will survive this.<eos> We're gonna drive you home now, Trish.
She'll... She'll wanna know what's happened.<eos> I'll sort it. Don't worry.<eos> Do I get police protection?<eos> No. Sorry.<eos> Is there anyone I can call to be with you?
Don't be afraid to use it.<eos> And you can call me any time.<eos> How am I gonna tell my daughter?<eos> Look, try not to think of that for now.<eos> OK, we're gonna take all this one step at a time and there'll be plenty of us around to support you.
If I'm so annoying, why did you come back?<eos> - You're always having a pop.<eos> - There's a protocol.<eos> I did not miss this, the constant berating.<eos> - She can't ring you all the time.
Sorry, sorry.<eos> It's been one of those days.<eos> Who am I kidding? It's always one of those days.<eos> Right.<eos> Let's talk about you.
Some have mental health issues.<eos> It's challenging.<eos> But I've watched you in training, in pilot sessions, in real-life situations.<eos> You've got something special to offer, Beth.<eos> We need you.
Message for Trish.<eos> This is Beth Latimer.<eos> I've been given your number.<eos> I think you might be expecting my call.<eos> I was hoping to come and see you either today or tomorrow so, if you want to give me a call back, my number here is 01632 960131.
- No.<eos> Can we talk in private? - Yeah.<eos> One of your staff members, Trish Winterman, she won't be in for a while. Erm...<eos> Personal reasons.<eos> Why am I hearing this from you?
Mind if I sit in?<eos> Not at all!<eos> Okay, class.<eos> I have a treat for you.<eos> I would like to introduce you to our principal, Mrs. Davis.
It's kind of gone out of vogue since the invention of the calculator... but, uh, I can still win a drink at a bar using it.<eos> Sorry for today.<eos> - Won't happen again.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Nice to meet you.
No, hold on!<eos> That this can't, isn't happening.<eos> I get it.<eos> I know.<eos> I'm with you.
What color was the dress Diane wore to prom?<eos> Diane didn't attend a prom because she didn't go to a high school.<eos> No prom.<eos> What sports did she play?<eos> As I told you earlier, she wasn't interested in sports.
And you called the police, didn't you?<eos> - Because he kidnapped her? - Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> And where did the police find young Mr. Riva and Diane?<eos> I told you.
Which I guess is obvious... since we're on the Intercoastal.<eos> Added this desk, so she could do her homework.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And this would be her room.<eos> So, while I'm trying to sell you on the house... and us... I just don't want you to think that we're completely insensitive... to what you're feeling.
No, hang on.<eos> That's not a good idea.<eos> Your visit here is the reason for the meltdown.<eos> What?<eos> She don't wanna see you.
I'm sorry, man.<eos> This is predictable.<eos> You know, she needs time.<eos> Just give me five minutes with her.<eos> I let you inside... then we're gonna betray her trust and we have an even bigger problem.
You know, she needs time.<eos> Just give me five minutes with her.<eos> I let you inside... then we're gonna betray her trust and we have an even bigger problem.<eos> - Hi. - Hi!<eos> Can we help you?
If you know your party's extension, you may dial it at any time.<eos> If you wish to speak to an operator... please stay on the line and someone will be with you as soon as possible.<eos> Good afternoon, MIT Mathematics, how may I direct your call?<eos> Hello?<eos> I'm sorry. I can't hear you very well.
No!<eos> No.<eos> Yeah.<eos> There you are.<eos> Yeah, can I help you?
Serial number 8141921.<eos> That's all I ever need to...<eos> Assigned to British Intelligence.<eos> What the hell is this thing?<eos> The lasso of Hestia compels you to reveal the truth.
How can you speak English so well?<eos> We speak hundreds of languages.<eos> We are the bridge to a greater understanding between all men.<eos> Right.<eos> I didn't get a chance to say this... earlier, but thank you for dragging me out of the water.
I didn't get a chance to say this... earlier, but thank you for dragging me out of the water.<eos> Thank you... for what you did on the beach.<eos> So... you are here to let me go?<eos> I tried, but it's not up to me.<eos> I even asked them to send me with you..
Then why do they do it?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> So you cannot sleep with me unless<eos> - I marry you.. - I...<eos> I sleep with you if you want.
- Then fine, if you don't mind...<eos> - No, it's up to you.<eos> - I know...<eos> - I'm just fine.<eos> - Coming to sleep with you.
Do you know about that?<eos> I've read all 12 volumes of Clio's criticism on earthly pleasures<eos> - 12 huh?<eos> - Mm hm.<eos> Did you bring any of those with you?
I know what you can and will succeed...<eos> It is what you're put on this earth to do.<eos> Something, it come to me last night.<eos> A different type of gas.<eos> For you.
I go where he tells me to go and I do what he tells me to do.<eos> Where I am from, that's called slavery.<eos> I really like her.<eos> Fantastic.<eos> Ladies after you.
Yep, that's not gonna work.<eos> Please put the sword down, Diana.<eos> Diana!<eos> Let me try by myself.<eos> After you, sir.
Diana!<eos> Let me try by myself.<eos> After you, sir.<eos> Etta...<eos> Why don't I meet you back at the office?
Yes thank you, gentlemen...<eos> Germany is an immensely proud nation.<eos> They will never surrender.<eos> Now look. The only way to end this war...<eos> Colonel, I need to talk to you outside.
And I need a immediate audience with the generals.<eos> You do not just barge in here.<eos> Sir with all due respect.. What I saw in my ^^... will change the course of war.<eos> Captain Trevor!<eos> I heard we lost you in one of your mission... and here you are, back from the dead... and I see you brought a friend.
- It is not confusing!<eos> It's unthinkable!<eos> - Who is this woman?<eos> - She is with me, she is with us.<eos> - I'm not.. I am not with you!
You mean you were lying?<eos> I'm a spy!<eos> That's what I do!<eos> How do I know you're not lying to me right now?<eos> I'm taking you to the front.
We need supplies and passage to Belgium.<eos> What's the going rate?<eos> Better be a good pay.<eos> Yeah, well, here's the thing.<eos> Um, I told you... will be quick.
"Run"...<eos> Also. There is enough here for a few days.<eos> Thank you sir.<eos> You're very welcome.<eos> Take great care all of you... and good luck.
There are shortages of food... meds and ammunition.<eos> Every hour we delay costs thousands of German lives.<eos> One attack and the world could be ours.<eos> As we speak, my chemistry...<eos> We stand against you and your... witch.
We stand against you and your... witch.<eos> Ludendorff, enough!<eos> 24 hours from now... this war will end.<eos> It is over.<eos> It's over for you.
Ludendorff, enough!<eos> 24 hours from now... this war will end.<eos> It is over.<eos> It's over for you.<eos> It is over for all of you..
Couple of 100 yards across the field.<eos> - The trench is...<eos> - Watch out!<eos> Chief!<eos> Oh it's good to see you.
Stay very very still, for me my friends.<eos> Please.<eos> It's so important.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> This has been such an honor for me taking you photograph.
But I'm the wrong color.<eos> Everyone's fighting their own battle, Diana.<eos> Truth is you're fighting yours.<eos> It's too much.<eos> I wish you...
No..<eos> No. I forbid it.<eos> Do you hear me?<eos> I forbid it.<eos> Sir, I am losing you!
Be polite.<eos> All right.<eos> Give me your hand.<eos> Like so.<eos> And I'll put my arm... around you like so.
- No, you are not coming with me.<eos> What you're wearing isn't exactly undercover.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I would say she was pretty undercover on that battlefield.<eos> It's just gonna, we can't get you there.
Steve, they have invitations.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Play it cool, you go this, you got this.<eos> Your invitation, please.<eos> Thank you sir. The Colonel and I wish... many blessings and all my love to fall up in your head.
What are you doing?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I don't drink.<eos> Have we met?<eos> No, but I have been watching you.
I hope I'm not causing...<eos> I know you and General Ludendorff are... very close.<eos> We work well together.<eos> Yes.<eos> Tell me some one like me behind you...
But I'm not what you thought I was.<eos> What is that?<eos> Future.<eos> I'm not your enemy, Diana.<eos> I'm the only one who truly knows you.
Only a God can kill another God.<eos> Zeus left the child he had with the queen of the Amazon. As a weapon to use against me.<eos> No.<eos> You liar.<eos> I compel you to tell me the truth.
Ideas, inspiration for formulas... weapons... but I don't make them use them.<eos> They start these wars on their own.<eos> All I do is orchestrate an armistice I know they cannot keep... in the hope they will destroy themselves.<eos> But it has never been enough.<eos> Until you.
And we could return this world to the paradise it was before them.<eos> Forever.<eos> I...<eos> I can never be a part of that.<eos> My dear, I don't want to fight you.
I'm not pregnant.<eos> Is that what you want?<eos> It's not about what I want or what you want..<eos> It's about why we haven't asked the question.<eos> Can I help you with that?
- You need a hand?<eos> Yeah, I think I do.<eos> Sounds like you're not getting any fuel.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What brings you to Cuba?
The same thing that brings everyone else to Cuba.<eos> Culture.<eos> People.<eos> Beauty.<eos> What brings you to Cuba?
Yeah..<eos> I've put a lot of work into getting you here in today.<eos> Now that I'm here, what do you want?<eos> I want you to work for me.<eos> Work for you?
I need to be clear here.<eos> US Government can not sanction this operation in anyway.<eos> You're on your own.<eos> This thing goes sideways you don't just get burned, you go to prison.<eos> And there's nothing we can do to get you out.
Let me tell you something.<eos> The only thing that I love more than saving lives..<eos> Is my daughter.<eos> So you don't shut up with this government bullshit right now and start showing some team spirit and respect for the Red Dragons.<eos> I'm gonna have all 20 of them lined up kick you right in the Tay-Tay.
Nah.<eos> Scrambled.<eos> Same number but they got some sort of micro-router..<eos> ..to bury the signal path which means Dom is clearly..<eos> Look, I do not know Dom as well as you, but if we just look at the facts.
What boyband bus did she fallen off?<eos> My new junior associate.<eos> He's working with me on this.<eos> All yours.<eos> Mr Nobody and I have been given the authority to get you out of this.
Oh come on. Give him a break.<eos> Get a break.<eos> Luke?<eos> I appreciate that.<eos> - It's good to see you, Nobody.
You're a genuine outlaw.<eos> I mean, you're a man who lives by his own rules.<eos> Which was surprising because when I saw you in Cuba, I heard about a guy who almost killed you with a motorcycle and you..<eos> let him keep his car?<eos> - Oh, that confused you?
- Toretto?<eos> - That's interesting you ask.<eos> This is my new base, welcome to Nowhere.<eos> Nice little stair for you.<eos> Listen, It's something I don't wanna talk to you about...
Don't think we've forgotten everything that you've done.<eos> We're not... teaming up with this guy.<eos> Let's get one thing clear.<eos> I ain't on your team.<eos> I don't care about you, you crew...
I know what you're thinking.<eos> I just let the guards go, so there is only two opponents in the room.<eos> Rhodes has the gun, so you'll take him out first, I know you.<eos> And then you're thinking.<eos> Elena is a cop, maybe the two of you can fight your way out of here.
- Konyert.<eos> - It's Vladupi.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Thought I was gonna check in on you from time to time,<eos> To see you how you're doing.
What's that?<eos> - Rule number three.<eos> - Which is?<eos> There are no rules.<eos> What did I told you, Luke?
Jones, Miss Parker.<eos> Hey Miss Parker.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> I wanted to thank you.
I want to introduce you to the most important person in my universe.<eos> Who will never give up on me.<eos> You've heard me say.<eos> "That you never turn your back on family."<eos> And I wanna thank you all for never turning your back on me.
Everyone...<eos> Meet Bryan.<eos> Hey Bryan.<eos> Thank you for giving us family.<eos> Thank you for giving us the strength.
She solid? Definitely.<eos> Janie won't say shit.<eos> Put the word out, anybody ID's me at that party, they're green-lit.<eos> Roger that.<eos> Can I help you?
- Nobody get up!<eos> Stay where you are!<eos> Please rise.<eos> Mr. Harlon, with this court finding you guilty of assault by a prisoner with a deadly weapon I'm sentencing you to the middle term of four years.<eos> In addition, having been found guilty of committing this crime in association and for the benefit of a gang, I'm sentencing you to an additional five years to run consecutively.
A warrior's deadliest weapon... is his mind.<eos> Welcome to the family, brother.<eos> Mr. Harlon, after serving 85 percent of your time... having a clean conduct record with no infractions... I recommend to the Parole Board your release... 30 days from today.<eos> This is your parole packet.<eos> Tells you who to report to.
She can take my shop, but I'm not leaving her anything.<eos> - I'm letting it go.<eos> You do that, pal, let it all go.<eos> Now, normally by this time, Steve's already had about eight cups of coffee... and he doesn't really handle the caffeine all that well.<eos> So, a little secret between you and I is I switched the brew in our office with decaf, you know, to take the edge off.
I'm gonna go to all the local art galleries show them the picture, just try to absorb as much cock as I can.<eos> In, uh ocularly, through my eyes, not...<eos> All right, well... I'm gonna go hop on this and I'll check in with you later.<eos> Jesus, man, that was bad.<eos> I'm wondering if I can ask you about an artist.
- Just a moment.<eos> - Hurry up?<eos> - No more patience.<eos> Have a mint.<eos> - How can I help you, gentlemen?
- I'm Thoyt, your father's lawyer.<eos> Smallpox butchered me down to the bone and, yes, I have other business than pissing.<eos> You know, in all of London, only your father believed you were still alive.<eos> It was a symptom of his madness.<eos> But he would talk to you, stand on the north bank of the river and call out to you on the other side.
Mr. Thoyt, welcome.<eos> Give us the bad news.<eos> As the late Mr. Delaney's lawyer, I attended the funeral, and a ghost appeared... A son we all thought dead in Africa.<eos> James Keziah Delaney.<eos> Mr. Wilton, I asked you to do some digging.
Mr. Ibbotson, I've been meaning to pay you a visit.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> You're a liar just like your father.<eos> You're a Delaney.<eos> Tell you what...
I'll know in 20 minutes.<eos> Come back when the church bell chimes.<eos> You did this.<eos> - You will pay for this. - No.<eos> No, because I have no fear to feed you with.
Come back when the church bell chimes.<eos> You did this.<eos> - You will pay for this. - No.<eos> No, because I have no fear to feed you with.<eos> No fear to give you and I will prove it.
No, because I have no fear to feed you with.<eos> No fear to give you and I will prove it.<eos> Sing for me like you once did as the river caught your tongue.<eos> Suicide.<eos> That will teach you not to steal, won't it?
Sing for me like you once did as the river caught your tongue.<eos> Suicide.<eos> That will teach you not to steal, won't it?<eos> You're not here. You are not here.<eos> I have no fear for you and I have no guilt for you.
13.<eos> Why would she keep you and not rent you?<eos> Too ugly.<eos> She says, one day, I'll catch a man and he'll carry me away.<eos> Someone like you.
Why would she keep you and not rent you?<eos> Too ugly.<eos> She says, one day, I'll catch a man and he'll carry me away.<eos> Someone like you.<eos> I spied you, too.
Someone like you.<eos> I spied you, too.<eos> Tell me about this man with the silver tooth...<eos> Winter.<eos> I can show you where he's moored, if you want.
Tribunal?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Or they'll proudly try to seize it and claim it as a spoil of war.<eos> Sir, I have seen nae deerskin treaty, nor have I seen fairies or water sprites.<eos> But what I do have are Malay coins, enough to bury you.
Yeah.<eos> Or they'll proudly try to seize it and claim it as a spoil of war.<eos> Sir, I have seen nae deerskin treaty, nor have I seen fairies or water sprites.<eos> But what I do have are Malay coins, enough to bury you.<eos> Prayer beads, not enough to get you to heaven.
I would rather that you worked with me rather than against me.<eos> Work at what?<eos> Necessary evil.<eos> And whorehouses are full of secrets, and secrets, to me, are weapons.<eos> I would very much like to talk business... but I would like you inside of me, Mr Delaney.
Holy Christ!<eos> Where the hell have you been?<eos> I made a fire in your room for the mice.<eos> In Parliament today, they'll be debating the beating of servants.<eos> The Whigs want to protect you.
This is my pastime - fixing colours in cloth.<eos> The demand for flags is always high in times of war.<eos> So you are three things, yes?<eos> You are a doctor... you are a merchant... and you are a spy.<eos> Unless you tell me who sent you, I will have to ask you to leave at the point of a gun.
We are an angry nation.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm counting on it.<eos> Good day.<eos> Post for you, madam.
The son does not inherit the debts of the father.<eos> James Delaney has declared a new trading company in his own name.<eos> And my father's debts amounted to a sum total of £215 and 17 shillings.<eos> Behold, £215 and 17 shillings.<eos> Mr Thoyt will pay each one of you exactly what you are due, but you will form an orderly line.
At least he's sorting his father's debts.<eos> What I'm owed isn't in that pile of coins... since I'm not listed on the final division notice.<eos> You see?<eos> The old skinflint didn't even pay for his whores!<eos> And what exactly is it that my father owed you?
I can wait.<eos> But Mr Delaney's son knew nothing of any marriage.<eos> How would he?<eos> He was in Africa.<eos> But he often spoke of you.
The Gypsy woman owns this island between two parishes.<eos> It is tradition she offers duellists a little token of good luck.<eos> Three shillings each for heather and goose feathers.<eos> This is not a fairground.<eos> Gentlemen, a slight has been perceived and one of you seeks satisfaction.
The lady and I will take our breakfast on the foreshore this morning, thank you.<eos> And, when they come, let them in. You can open every door.<eos> We have nothing here to hide.<eos> You will hang.<eos> They will catch you and hang you.
Your apprentice.<eos> Lick.<eos> Lick your finger.<eos> Now, gentlemen, before I go on the subject of confidence... and betrayal, I hear that the Company are offering £10 for any information.<eos> I also know that one of you has already considered collecting.
Lick your finger.<eos> Now, gentlemen, before I go on the subject of confidence... and betrayal, I hear that the Company are offering £10 for any information.<eos> I also know that one of you has already considered collecting.<eos> Let me be very clear.<eos> I know which one of you it is.
Damn soldiers!<eos> You owe me Delaney!<eos> Now...<eos> They have reports that say that some of the robbers were women.<eos> But only the Company are aggrieved, so no-one can take you to the clink or to the poultry tower.
Be careful.<eos> Making gunpowder and being careful are good bedfellows.<eos> What?<eos> What do you see?<eos> He's just scared of you.
Making gunpowder and being careful are good bedfellows.<eos> What?<eos> What do you see?<eos> He's just scared of you.<eos> Everybody's scared of you.
Work faster.<eos> Steady as we go.<eos> Good boy.<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> The letters your father wrote to you are beautiful.
For nine years, you have been campaigning for a Royal Commission to investigate the drowning of these 280 slaves, which you say was done deliberately.<eos> It is my belief that some very powerful men in London were involved in an illicit shipment of slaves for personal profit, were complicit in the deaths of those slaves and in the subsequent concealment of the facts.<eos> And you believe that those men are senior directors within the Honourable East India Company?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> Well then, Mr. Chichester, I have some good news for you.
No, no, no. "Full and willing cooperation."<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> And then... I will tell you which papers to burn.<eos> Sir.<eos> There is a Mr. Delaney to see you, madam.
Accept what?<eos> Nootka landing ground in return for the tea trade to Canton.<eos> And safe passage through your blockade.<eos> But you must assign the treaty before you leave London.<eos> Well, that would require me to trust you.
We need some more coal for my fireplace. It's freezing!<eos> Why would we do that?<eos> This is the Delaney household.<eos> We have no warmth here.<eos> Mr. Cholmondeley is not a suitable man for you.
My love.<eos> My love.<eos> This is a holy man of God.<eos> He's practised in removing and discouraging demons.<eos> Your husband reports a Barbason has been visiting you.
You know nothing.<eos> Always cow-eyed about your sainted mother.<eos> Or maybe it's about time you know about your mother.<eos> I do.<eos> Do you know she took you down to the river to drown you?
Always cow-eyed about your sainted mother.<eos> Or maybe it's about time you know about your mother.<eos> I do.<eos> Do you know she took you down to the river to drown you?<eos> Carried you across the foreshore.
Carried you across the foreshore.<eos> A tiny baby in her arms.<eos> Innocent and sweet.<eos> She waded in.<eos> Held you under, until the bubbles stopped!
She waded in.<eos> Held you under, until the bubbles stopped!<eos> She was deranged, James!<eos> That's why your father had her committed to Bedlam.<eos> To protect you.
That's why your father had her committed to Bedlam.<eos> To protect you.<eos> To save your life, son.<eos> Desperate for your death!<eos> It took three men to pull you apart.
She was clawing and spitting, dragged from the river howling and screaming.<eos> Be very, very careful now!<eos> She wanted you dead, James.<eos> Go away, Winter.<eos> I'm not scared of you.
And on its own, it is harmless.<eos> But when it is added to the sulphur and charcoal in our vats, it is anything but.<eos> Think of it as like adding a baby to a marriage.<eos> All was ordered and calm and now there is this thing that demands attention.<eos> Stops you sleeping, belches, farts, screams... and she's going to make this whole process louder and wilder, more insane, more impractical... and the only thing that will stop this entire enterprise from erupting in a giant explosion the size of Mauritius is this... and dedication.
Doesn't drink.<eos> They should not be dropping him on us like a black cannonball.<eos> Mr. George Chichester.<eos> Gentlemen.<eos> How good of you to see me.
That golden age.<eos> You want to know where he is?<eos> My dear, the whole of London wants to know where he is.<eos> His Majesty's Government wants to know where he is.<eos> I'm afraid we cannot help you.
I will tell Mr. Madison I have made an extraordinary discovery.<eos> A man in London who can be relied upon.<eos> Hm. Yes, you tell him that and I will rely upon him to give my ship safe passage through the American blockade.<eos> If my factory is discovered...<eos> I will know where to find you.
Republicans haven't got any money, why would I sell it to them?<eos> They think you're going to start a revolution.<eos> If the Prince genuinely thought I was going to start a revolution, I would be in the Tower.<eos> He's not a safeguard.<eos> If Crown and Company solve their little dispute, they will crush you between them.
No.<eos> Go away.<eos> I'm busy.<eos> I'm not fit to be near you now.<eos> I brought this for you.
I received a message that you wished to speak with me.<eos> After you have eluded me so long.<eos> May I sit?<eos> I need to know why you're seeking me?<eos> First, I must tell you that I already know many things about you.
And an element of strategy.<eos> So get to it.<eos> Arrest the bastard.<eos> Thank you, madam.<eos> Mr. Chichester, this is the man I told you about...
And all of those who have use to me will sail along with me.<eos> And on my ship, there will be no rules and there will be no judgment.<eos> We're sailing to a new world and that is the plan.<eos> James... you are a fool.<eos> They are going to hang you.
Now, you can do that, can't you?<eos> Right. Right.<eos> We're good.<eos> Mr. Godfrey has decided he will do the honourable thing.<eos> Your testimony will be with you within the week.
To the Molly House!<eos> I cannot pack up my entire life in five minutes.<eos> Well, you can pack it up or you can lose it.<eos> This is ridiculous.<eos> What about you?
Mr. Delaney...<eos> His Majesty seeks information.<eos> I really have no taste for this, so perhaps we can conduct this business like gentlemen.<eos> They will allow no easy escape... to death.<eos> Since it is imperative that we keep you alive until after your conviction for treason, the doctor is here to help and assist Mr. Arrow, who will do most of the necessary work.

So make it.<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> My name is George Chichester.<eos> And when you have taken your shot, I'd like to talk to you.<eos> I have nothing to say to you.
My name is George Chichester.<eos> And when you have taken your shot, I'd like to talk to you.<eos> I have nothing to say to you.<eos> You should know that I have testimony from a reliable witness...<eos> I've told you, I have nothing to say to you.
Well, your plan worked...<eos> you in a cell, me on a hook.<eos> I'm here.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I have a use for you.
Nootka Sound is not for sale.<eos> I have something of great value to your nation, something the British are trying to kill me for.<eos> Someone has been brought to London to try and kill me, and I will need your eyes and ears from now on.<eos> You used to straighten your skirts and march away like nothing had ever happened.<eos> And what exactly is it that my father owed you?
The silver tooth is mine.<eos> Who has a blade for the dentistry?<eos> Relax, Mr. Delaney.<eos> You're in safe hands.<eos> Your devil saved you.
I need him to take a message to Thomas Jefferson and the President of the United States.<eos> In Ponta Delgada, Colonnade told me that he would find me an emissary to Thomas Jefferson.<eos> So just tell me what you want to say to Carlsbad, and I'll stitch you up and set you loose.<eos> No?<eos> Interesting knife they used to carve you up.
Interesting knife they used to carve you up.<eos> Is that Chinese, you think?<eos> Or Malay?<eos> When you came in here with bits of a man's flesh between your teeth... we kind of had a silent deal.<eos> I stitch you up and you give me information.
Get four nails and a wooden board and a man called Solomon Coop into this room by tomorrow at noon.<eos> Can you manage that?<eos> By midday, Mr. Pettifer.<eos> I do what I can with the rotten dock trash Atticus brings, so the least you can do is sit before you refuse it.<eos> And if that sickly youth on the doorstep is there to protect you from East India assassins, know that by 2:00 AM he's easily distracted by whores.
Please understand that from this moment I will burn your letters without opening them.<eos> Then I will visit you in your dreams, my love.<eos> Please. I'm your sister.<eos> Let all else lie.<eos> There is a woman here to see you and I swear the only way I could have stopped her would have been to use the pistol you gave me and don't think I would be loathe to use it because she's mad
Is that your lawyer?<eos> My lawyer assures me that, as Horace Delaney's widow, by natural law of the land, this house is therefore half mine.<eos> - It's a copy.<eos> - It's now kindling.<eos> My servant wants to shoot you in the face.
As a rule, the King's council very rarely makes business with an actress unless it's up the back alley of Maiden Lane.<eos> The piece of paper you just burnt also states that, as Horace Delaney's widow, I also own half the trading post at Nootka Sound and I believe Nootka is of value to you and to the King.<eos> So, as you can see, it's a very simple swap, Mr. Delaney.<eos> Your half of the house for my half of a piece of land that I have no interest in or use for.<eos> I also have a trunk full of your father's belongings, letters to you, to your father from your mother.
You're as good as a hole in the hull.<eos> I did check the records.<eos> You were aboard a ship that sank off Africa.<eos> A slave ship?<eos> I believe that a man is capable of change... and I also believe that that is of no consequence to you.
It exhausts us both.<eos> A beautiful exhaustion.<eos> And in the morning I read the Gazette and she eats her toast... like a sweet little bird.<eos> I didn't come to sell you insurance, Mr. Delaney.<eos> I came to thank you.
The price was two sovereigns.<eos> I'm not a courtesan.<eos> But we are here and there is a room with a bed and fire.<eos> Now this gentleman is a Duke.<eos> He asked for you particularly and he was told by your theatre manager you would comply.
That bitch is on the gallows... before Mass!<eos> Down there.<eos> Perhaps now you will listen to me.<eos> This diamond... this is yours.<eos> I have a man that will take you to Paris and you will stay there until this business is done.
Deputy briggs.<eos> Please hand me that gun.<eos> Okay.<eos> Here.<eos> Now, I'm gonna need identification From both of you, please.
Really.<eos> I don't know why I'm even thinking about furniture.<eos> Andy and I hardly ever get home.<eos> What's up, lucy?<eos> Margaret lanterman for you on line two, hawk.
I would like to see it, albert.<eos> Can I smoke in here?<eos> Smoke?<eos> Ask macklay when he gets back.<eos> But smoking's bad for you.
Mullins, here's your coffee, sir.<eos> Thank you, phil.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Sit down, dougie.<eos> Just close the door behind you When you go, phil.
Sit down, dougie.<eos> Just close the door behind you When you go, phil.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Dougie, Now that I've had time to think about this, It's clear that your investigative work<eos> Flowing through this office. The recent two attempts on your life, The blowing up your car, the man trying to shoot you,
Just close the door behind you When you go, phil.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Dougie, Now that I've had time to think about this, It's clear that your investigative work<eos> Flowing through this office. The recent two attempts on your life, The blowing up your car, the man trying to shoot you,<eos> Also, thanks to you, we now know that The mitchum brothers' case was not arson But a legitimate claim for an accidental fire,
Although alleged gangsters, Are not part of this conspiracy, Which suggests that the shots are being called<eos> Somebody else.<eos> I think you're right, dougie.<eos> And this is interesting.<eos> The mitchums just called me, Wanting to have a personal sit-down with you.
Which, because it was truly was an accident, Will cover our potential loss and then some.<eos> Bushnell double down.<eos> Bushnell double down.<eos> Nobody keeps battling bud on the ropes for long.<eos> They want to see you at 5:30.
Oh... dougie.<eos> Here's to you, dougie.<eos> Mr. Jackpots!<eos> Oh. This is the man I told you about.<eos> I wanted to see you again.
Here's to you, dougie.<eos> Mr. Jackpots!<eos> Oh. This is the man I told you about.<eos> I wanted to see you again.<eos> I've thought of you every day, What you did for me.
He's back in my life again.<eos> I have a little dog.<eos> I have a house.<eos> I have my life back again.<eos> How can I ever thank you?
He saved my life.<eos> Sure saved us a lot too.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you, mr.<eos> Jackpots. I'm so thankful I got A chance to say thank you again.
They brought it in a couple weeks ago.<eos> Your room seems different.<eos> And men are coming.<eos> I'm-I'm not sure I know what you mean.<eos> I am trying to tell you that you have to watch out!
- Excuse me. - Hmm?<eos> Sheriff Truman is here.<eos> Yeah, please, have him come in.<eos> Frank.<eos> Good to see you.
Good to see you.<eos> How are you?<eos> Have a seat. Yeah.<eos> So...<eos> What can I do for you?
I thought so too.<eos> I really think he would like it.<eos> It'd mean a lot to him.<eos> I'm sorry, Ben, to bring you this news.<eos> Good to see you again.
He's here.<eos> Daddy! Daddy. Next stop, Wendy's.<eos> It's seven o'clock.<eos> Do you know where your freedom is?<eos> Coming to you live and electrified from studio A, high atop the escarpments of White Tail Peak, the roof-- ruff, ruff-- of the American Hindu Kush, this is Dr. Amp doing the vamp for liberty,
Do you know where your freedom is?<eos> Coming to you live and electrified from studio A, high atop the escarpments of White Tail Peak, the roof-- ruff, ruff-- of the American Hindu Kush, this is Dr. Amp doing the vamp for liberty,<eos> climbing the ramp to justice, and lighting the lamp of freedom.<eos> So... what's on your mind tonight?<eos> I mean, you know I'm gonna tell you what's on mine.
These giant multinational corporations are filled with monstrous vermin, poisonous, vile murderers, and they eat, drink, and shit money.<eos> They buy our politicians for a song.<eos> Then these fucking politicians sing as we gag and cough, sold down the river to die.<eos> Fuck you who betray the people you were elected to help, elected to work to help to make life better for.<eos> Fuck you all in the ass, you fucking treasonous puppets!

Thanks.<eos> I'll, be right back.<eos> - Hadley, Willa.<eos> - Hi, Miss Fields.<eos> Hi. Well, can I talk to you, ladies?
- You look so beautiful.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> My God, are you crying too?<eos> I'm just...<eos> I'm so happy to be here with all of you.
Archer, I'm sure you say that to all the girls.<eos> No, I do not.<eos> Charlotte Drake, I will be calling you.<eos> And I'm not going to wait three days.<eos> I'll ring you tomorrow.
If anyone can show a just cause why this couple cannot lawfully be joined together in matrimony let them speak now or forever hold their peace.<eos> By the power vested in me<eos> I now pronounce you husband and wife.<eos> You may kiss the bride.<eos> I present you for the very first time.
Guys, I'm leaving for three weeks.<eos> Why is everybody crying?<eos> I don't know.<eos> For some reason, this feels like it's the end of something.<eos> I love you, guys.
After a successful stint running the secretive special operations killing machine in Iraq,<eos> Glen was appointed leader of US and coalition forces in Afghanistan.<eos> A war which, as he saw it, wasn't being won 'cause it wasn't being led.<eos> General.<eos> We're all very excited to have you here.
For all his many achievements leading special operations in Iraq, I think most of us here will know General McMahon as the man who took out al-Zarwaqi, who kicked al-Qaeda in the sack.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> We have a warrior at the helm, and it's a pleasure to have you, sir.<eos> Glen was known as a humble man.<eos> But humble in that way that says, my humility makes me better than you.
Let's knock this on the head.<eos> All right.<eos> Basically, he was a master of systems organization.<eos> Which he'd kind of need to be, if he was to corral this 43-nation coalition of the willing.<eos> - May I help you?
Which he'd kind of need to be, if he was to corral this 43-nation coalition of the willing.<eos> - May I help you?<eos> - No, finish your phone call.<eos> The war can wait.<eos> What can I do for you, General?
The entire base is rolling with Eurosexuals who are so drunk they can't even stand up.<eos> General McMahon here to see Ambassador MacKinnon.<eos> - Glen.<eos> - Pat.<eos> Great to see you.
- You sure?<eos> - You go.<eos> - I thought you were finished.<eos> - No.<eos> To that end... now is probably a good time to share with you where the president hopes that assessment might land.
There are those who believe they can win in the face of all evidence to the contrary.<eos> And there are those who know they can't.<eos> Unfortunately for the world, it's the believers who climb to the top of the ladder.<eos> It's guys like Glen who get given the keys to the castle.<eos> President Karzai is very much looking forward to meeting you.
But this machine seems only to have this wire.<eos> I can't find where to plug it into the television.<eos> I'm sorry, Mr. President.<eos> I'm afraid I don't know a whole lot about technology.<eos> I'm sure I could have somebody come by and take a look at it for you.
But... I've seen the country.<eos> To get inside the mind of Glen McMahon, you really need first to get a handle on the madness of modern American war.<eos> Lieutenant Colonel Frank Groom.<eos> Welcome to Kandahar, sir.<eos> Nice to meet you, Frank.
Probably should've asked for a lot more.<eos> I just thought 40,000 sounded like a reasonable number.<eos> There's no reasonable number, Glen, except perhaps zero.<eos> That's a reasonable number. Zero. I thought you understood that.<eos> Yeah, this "no more troops" thing, is that coming from the president, or coming from you?
Cut through. You need to get me some goddamn cut through.<eos> I can handle that for you, sir.<eos> Sorry. No offense, Simon, how exactly are you gonna do that?<eos> I'll quieten this whole situation down.<eos> Again, I'm sorry, I don't wanna start a fight here. And please forgive me for speaking for you, sir. But the general didn't hire me to make things quiet, okay?
Well, Dick, I answered the questions that were asked of me.<eos> - I thought I was being fair.<eos> - It's not a question of fair, Glen.<eos> It's a question of what the fuck were you doing on the television?<eos> Why am I seeing you on the television?
We're not in theater.<eos> You boys earned it.<eos> Sir, have you had a chance to say hello to your wife yet?<eos> You know, she checked in this morning.<eos> I think she's waiting for you in your room.
- Hi.<eos> Hi.<eos> I'm sorry, I've been delayed.<eos> The president is wanting time with me tomorrow, and we've been trying to ascertain whether... whether or not we can accommodate this request.<eos> I'm gonna leave you two be.
Get your PowerPoint presentation in order, you know?<eos> Just move the needle a little bit.<eos> Show everyone how all the graphs are pointing in the right direction.<eos> That's all you gotta do.<eos> That's how this ends best for you anyway.
It's good to talk.<eos> Everybody.<eos> How are you?<eos> Morning.<eos> Yeah, it's good to see you again.
Good to see you. Nice tie.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> All right. How's it going?<eos> - Morning, sir.<eos> Nice to see you again. - All right.
All right. How's it going?<eos> - Morning, sir.<eos> Nice to see you again. - All right.<eos> Take care now.<eos> It's good to see you, Mr. President.
All right, see you soon.<eos> - Mr. President.<eos> - It's great to see you, General.<eos> I'm sorry, but we're running behind schedule.<eos> I was looking forward to getting some face time with you, but I gotta get this baby in the air.
You both look beautiful.<eos> Really.<eos> Sir, before you get dragged into the hubbub there, I want to introduce you to Sean Cullen here.<eos> Sean's the writer from Rolling Stone.<eos> He's been doing that profile piece on you.
It's a real privilege.<eos> - Rolling Stone?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> Just make sure I'm on the cover.<eos> Well, it's between you and Lady Gaga, sir.
Tom Howard, sir.<eos> I'm the United States defense attaché here in Paris.<eos> Pleased to meet you.<eos> This is my wife, Jeanie.<eos> Pleased to meet you, Jeanie.
But there were some very interesting people there today.<eos> If you'd like, I'd be very happy to give you a rundown of the who's who if you get a little window in your schedule while...<eos> I appreciate that. My schedule's very tight. Of course.<eos> Totally understood.<eos> General, I could introduce you to some people here tonight if you'd prefer.
General, I could introduce you to some people here tonight if you'd prefer.<eos> No, I think my team and I have a grip on the who's who. Thank you.<eos> Cory, where's Badi?<eos> I don't know, boss. He was here a minute ago.<eos> I thought he was supposed to be sitting beside you and Jeanie.
Wrong.<eos> This dinner is for Afghanistan.<eos> We are here tonight because we're at war in Afghanistan.<eos> And you got the goddamn gall to kick the only Afghan in the room - off my goddamn table? - I'm sorry...<eos> Let me tell you what I want you to do, Tom Howard.
I'm pretty sure the Afghan ambassador here is from Afghanistan.<eos> General.<eos> Sir.<eos> Swell.<eos> I don't want for this dinner to be awkward for you, General, so I will tell you now that we intend to give you our portion of the troops that you request.
Then what's the plan?<eos> We're drinking. Tell me we're fucking drinking.<eos> Today is Jeanie and my's 30th wedding anniversary, so...<eos> I'm taking her to dinner.<eos> Just the two of you?
Progress is being made. Real progress.<eos> But challenges do remain.<eos> Yes, I understand all of that, General.<eos> And... and, please, let me say quite sincerely that I do not question the goodness of your intent.<eos> I have been listening to you here this morning, and... I believe you are a good man.
Please sit here.<eos> Please, please sit. Sit.<eos> - How are you?<eos> - I'm fine, sir.<eos> I've been trying to contact you.
I've been trying to contact you.<eos> Oh, yes, I'm sorry.<eos> I'm not feeling well.<eos> I understand, sir.<eos> But did they not tell you this is urgent?
Your people.<eos> Again, I'm sorry, sir... but you need to behave like a leader.<eos> But I am behaving like a leader.<eos> I'm unavailable.<eos> I am as unavailable to you as is your own president.
We both know it was never really mine to give. But... I thank you for inviting me to participate in the theater of it all.<eos> And good luck.<eos> I wish you much success.<eos> Good luck tonight, Glen.<eos> Who told you about tonight?
It was glib.<eos> I just thought it was a pithy way to end the conversation, but I was wrong.<eos> There's gonna be thousands of parades.<eos> Thousands of 'em all over America.<eos> Only none of them will be for you.
We're gonna lose guys.<eos> I am not gonna lie to you about that.<eos> There will be casualties.<eos> But if you keep your wits about you, if you have faith in your ability, if you have faith in the ability of the men next to you, you will come out the tail end of this!<eos> I have faith in you!
My name is General Glen McMahon.<eos> On behalf of the coalition forces, I wanna apologize to you for the loss you've suffered here today.<eos> I know the money that Sergeant Ortega gave you can't bring back your family.<eos> But hopefully it can help you to rebuild, because rebuilding is what we're all about.<eos> And providing you with the security you need to live a long and prosperous life.
But hopefully it can help you to rebuild, because rebuilding is what we're all about.<eos> And providing you with the security you need to live a long and prosperous life.<eos> Roads and schools and then jobs, so... you can raise your families, and jobs so you can put food on the table.<eos> The Taliban aren't gonna provide you jobs.<eos> The Taliban aren't here to help you.
And providing you with the security you need to live a long and prosperous life.<eos> Roads and schools and then jobs, so... you can raise your families, and jobs so you can put food on the table.<eos> The Taliban aren't gonna provide you jobs.<eos> The Taliban aren't here to help you.<eos> Only we can help you.
Only we can help you.<eos> We have a saying in America.<eos> You can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs.<eos> I understand that sometimes it can be hard to see the helping hand, what with all the guns and the strange guys and the mess and what have you.<eos> But I assure you, this is the hand of helping.
Eat 'em alive!<eos> Jesus Christ, Willy.<eos> What time is it?<eos> It's me, boss.<eos> Sorry to wake you.
- Sir.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> Dick.<eos> Glen.<eos> The president wants to see you in DC.
And what do you have on me?<eos> The goods.<eos> The goods?<eos> Oh, that sounds bad.<eos> Fat Tony, may I speak to you in Italian?
Nicholas!<eos> I missed you.!<eos> Now, where is the Chloe?<eos> Of course she's networking.<eos> I just want to introduce you to Juliette. This is my Amabella's nanny. - Hello.
Hello, Norman.<eos> Mrs. Claremont.<eos> Aww. Beautiful weather we're having?<eos> Hi.<eos> Can I help you?
The store is definitely my baby.<eos> What's your name?<eos> Norman Bates.<eos> I'm Madeleine Loomis.<eos> Well, it's sure been nice meeting you.
You've been a model prisoner.<eos> It's bullshit. It's politics.<eos> I'm... I'm a crooked cop, Phil;<eos> That's what they do.<eos> Yeah, make an example out of you.
Yeah, I mean, it happened. We did not plan it, but...<eos> I just felt so strong, like life had given me a second chance.<eos> Can I... can I talk to you about something?<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> Well, I want to thank you.
Turn it off!<eos> Someone's gonna hear it.<eos> - I'm trying. - Norman, hurry.<eos> Just chuck it in the water!<eos> An inmate at the Bend Correctional Facility is attempting to contact you.
Check, please!<eos> It's okay. I'm just gonna take some of this bread from the bread basket.<eos> When you got bread and Vegemite, you got yourself a meal.<eos> What?<eos> Vegemite? They should call you cuckoos instead of Kiwis.
- Nice! Sweet!<eos> Okay, I love her.<eos> - Right?<eos> Be-mazing? I don't know how she would say it, but she is incredible!<eos> I am telling you, she is one of us.
So, like, we're not gonna get in trouble for an accident.<eos> We're in Florida, Alice.<eos> A white dude is dead at the hands of a bunch of women.<eos> Yeah, white women.<eos> I'm black, in case any of you have forgotten.
The whole house is made out of glass.<eos> This is impossible. You can see in everywhere.<eos> Where could we put him that he's not gonna be seen?<eos> So, what do you think, Uncle Jack?<eos> They could charge you with involuntary manslaughter, but it's not that easy to prove.
Shit.<eos> My pants.<eos> I don't have time for this.<eos> Good evening, Officer.<eos> How can I be of service to you?
Please.<eos> That's great.<eos> Slow down.<eos> - Thank you, Officer.<eos> - I almost shot you. I know.
You see? Hello.<eos> Get your hands against the wall.<eos> - I am not... - Get your hands against the wall!<eos> I am taking a passive stance.<eos> My body is limp for you!
Sir, I could wire you $50,000 right now if you just let us go, okay?<eos> 50,000 what?<eos> There's over $2 million worth of diamonds in this house, and I am going to find them.<eos> You shoot anyone who moves.<eos> Don't make a fucking sound or I will kill you.
- Totally. - That's a hard thing.<eos> - Yeah, you're right.<eos> I have changed.<eos> I thought that I was making people's lives better, but I forgot about the people that make my life better, and that's you guys.<eos> - And I love you, and I'm sorry.
My number one boss bitch!<eos> And now to celebrate her win, we have a special request.<eos> Me?<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> I actually have a surprise for all of you.
Me?<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> I actually have a surprise for all of you.<eos> I've written a song that I hope can sort of encapsulate the bond of friendship that we all have.<eos> And so, I want to play it for you now.
You need to toss his body in the ocean<eos> And you don't care<eos> 'Cause your friends are there by your side<eos> They make it fun<eos> I love you, girls
But they should be able to just take my name off. - I mean...<eos> - Nothing's gonna stop us, honey.<eos> Ticking bomb. I'll leave it at that.<eos> Could she put a shirt on?<eos> Our very first project will be for each of you to do a family tree, where you get to talk about your wonderful family.
Ticking bomb. I'll leave it at that.<eos> Could she put a shirt on?<eos> Our very first project will be for each of you to do a family tree, where you get to talk about your wonderful family.<eos> Isn't that great?<eos> But before that, I am going to introduce you to a very, very special friend to our class.
- But kind of great. - Yeah.<eos> So, the sex that you have is like...<eos> Hi, Celeste, Madeline!<eos> - How are you? - Hi, Renata.<eos> I was over there with my girlfriends, getting our drink on, and I saw you two.
- I'm just trying to make a point.<eos> - Obviously.<eos> The school board cannot force my son to pray, or anyone else for that matter.<eos> So... sue them.<eos> First of all, can I just say, it is wonderful to see you all again.
A million dollars.<eos> For fuck's sake...<eos> - It's not a fucking joke, lady.<eos> - Uh, listen...<eos> I don't know what this guy's told you, but my organization is a nonprofit organization.
Your mother's a whore!<eos> Get the hell off of me!<eos> Oh, Billy.<eos> Go to hell, commies!<eos> No one wants you.
If anyone's in need of self-reflection, David, that'd be you.<eos> I bet Bill Jr. would beg to differ.<eos> Our guest tonight is Madalyn Murray O'Hair, the American Atheist who removed the Bible from public schools.<eos> She's at the university for a speaking engagement.<eos> O'Hair, that's new for you, isn't it?
- Yeah, I wanna ask Mrs. Murray...<eos> - Uh, Murray O'Hair.<eos> How can you look at yourself in the mirror every day?<eos> Only a godless bitch like you would go to court to stop prayer.<eos> Thanks to you, this country's on its way to hell in a handbasket.
- Uh, Murray O'Hair.<eos> How can you look at yourself in the mirror every day?<eos> Only a godless bitch like you would go to court to stop prayer.<eos> Thanks to you, this country's on its way to hell in a handbasket.<eos> Somebody should cut your tongue out, tie you up and throw your lifeless corpse off the...
Lady, have I gotta explain the damn birds and the bees for ya?<eos> It's called sex.<eos> And you can bet the Virgin Mary was all for it.<eos> Virgin birth, my ass.<eos> Jesus loves you, Madalyn.
All my life... I just wanted one person somewhere, sometime, to understand me.<eos> And that person turned out to be you.<eos> We're in this together.<eos> From Hollywood, The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson.<eos> This is Ed McMahon along with Doc Severinsen and the NBC Orchestra inviting you to join Johnny and his guests...
God and the savior versus atheist Madalyn Murray O'Hair.<eos> Madalyn, what exactly is it that you have against God?<eos> First off, there isn't any.<eos> And second off, your God manifests itself through organized churches, your organized movement.<eos> And every single one of them, including you, is always interested in money.
First off, there isn't any.<eos> And second off, your God manifests itself through organized churches, your organized movement.<eos> And every single one of them, including you, is always interested in money.<eos> You show me once where Jesus Christ passed out a collection plate.<eos> Now, Madalyn, I... I see you here... and I hear you talking.
There's gonna be a weeping' and a wailin' and a gnashing of teeth.<eos> You gotta be kiddin' me!<eos> What the hell do you care where I go, what I believe?<eos> I don't care what you believe in.<eos> I wanna bring you to God. I want to save your soul.
Mr. Waters.<eos> Thank you, Roy.<eos> Ms. O'Hair, it is a pleasure.<eos> Oh, well, have a seat.<eos> I saw you on Carson last week.
Yeah, you live long enough and you lose faith in people.<eos> Not that I ever had much faith in anyone.<eos> But... you have impressed me, David.<eos> Starting to wish Bill Jr. Could've turned out more like you.<eos> He really hurt you, huh?
You know... if somebody did something to them... it's probably someone from that place.<eos> My mother pissed off a lot of people.<eos> Especially those she was closest to.<eos> Uh, excuse me, uh...<eos> I just want to say American Atheists has had a wonderful year, and... that would not be so without all of you.
Yeah.<eos> My Billy Boy... he used to mix a mean Manhattan.<eos> Here's to new friends.<eos> You're all right, Danny Fry.<eos> You know, I'm real sorry we're putting you through all this.
What about you, Red?<eos> You hate me for taking you away from your father?<eos> You didn't take me away from him.<eos> I was too hard on him.<eos> I'm too hard on all of you.
You didn't take me away from him.<eos> I was too hard on him.<eos> I'm too hard on all of you.<eos> You're only hard on us because you believe we can be great.<eos> I love you two.
I'm disgusted to learn that this school plans to perform Once Upon a Mattress this year.<eos> Now, not only does that sound like a porno, upon further investigation, this mattress show also glorifies an unwed mother. So...<eos> No, go ahead and laugh, 'cause that's very funny.<eos> Unsafe sex is very funny, right?<eos> Shame on you, Ms. Martino.
Brothers, stay the F away from me!<eos> Watch your language.<eos> Don't provoke him, Joan.<eos> You threatening me, new woman?<eos> Yes, I'm threatening you.
Censoring it is like putting pants on Elmo so no one sees the nothing between his legs.<eos> Elmo doesn't wear pants?<eos> I'm kidding.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Yeah, I'm threatening you.
As a result of this lunacy, the character of Lady Larken will no longer be pregnant out of wedlock.<eos> We have a state-mandated teen-mothers program at our school, but the board thinks an unwed storybook mom is too scandalous?<eos> Lady Larken and I aren't both perfectly pretty, and I don't have her perfect soprano voice.<eos> But the truth is... the Lady and I have a lot more in common than you'd ever guess.<eos> So, Mr. Healy... this hot flow is for you.
By its very definition, oppression is cruel and unjust.<eos> The question becomes, how much weight should we give to this pain?<eos> Justice also maintains credibility as a central value, because the concept which regulates the terms of all social contracts as well as being an unlimited good...<eos> People talk down to us because they're looking down at us.<eos> Being short in America today means that we're facing a variety of prejudices, and I am here to convince you that those challenges and prejudices that height-challenged Americans face today are not only real, but pervasive, and they should be dealt with.
- From stranger danger?<eos> Boy Scouts of America.<eos> Solomon, you know you're grounded. Get inside.<eos> Guys, I have to go.<eos> None of you confessed?
More weight.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Uh, I want... I want your advice.<eos> Go away!<eos> I just want to talk to you.
I don't use electricity anymore.<eos> They can track it backwards now.<eos> So what do you want?<eos> I screwed up a lot of stuff, and now... I don't know what to do. No one'll listen to me.<eos> How do you get people to listen to you?
They can track it backwards now.<eos> So what do you want?<eos> I screwed up a lot of stuff, and now... I don't know what to do. No one'll listen to me.<eos> How do you get people to listen to you?<eos> And now, I mean, they love you.
This is for your own benefit, so everyone gets the chance to speak.<eos> Okay?<eos> Diwata Jones.<eos> Hi. I'm Diwata Jones.<eos> Though some of you might know me as Sister Berthe from sophomore year's production of The Sound of Music.
Perhaps not everything.<eos> Jordan.<eos> If the Hellhound can open the rift, we all go together.<eos> You're the bad guy.<eos> I'm pretty sure helping you is a bad idea.
World War II.<eos> He's a Nazi.<eos> He wants the Hunt for himself.<eos> He wants his own supernatural army.<eos> We're not letting you through that rift.
But smiling and shaking hand...<eos> Ooh, shaking with both hands.<eos> - He's overcompensating.<eos> - So are you right now.<eos> Well, thank you both for everything.
Not if it belongs to someone else.<eos> So... let's find out.<eos> [Door buzzes]<eos> Benjamin Jones, I'd like you to meet my supervisor, Agent Justine Diaz.<eos> Agent Dao speaks very highly of you, Agent Diaz.
[Door buzzes]<eos> Benjamin Jones, I'd like you to meet my supervisor, Agent Justine Diaz.<eos> Agent Dao speaks very highly of you, Agent Diaz.<eos> Oh, you mean Special Agent Dao, now of the FBI's Intelligence Division.<eos> I got promoted thanks to you.

Which I understand you were opposed to, so maybe he called you.<eos> To tell me he was breaking out of jail?<eos> I want him to stay in jail.<eos> You're the ones that got him out.<eos> We just need to know if he called you.
Call me later.<eos> Sorry, client emergency.<eos> Of course.<eos> I think we're done for now.<eos> Thank you both for your time.
I didn't know it was a secret.<eos> For her sake and for our sake, please just do this one job.<eos> Man, you used to love safecracking.<eos> [Knocking continues]<eos> Gentlemen, sorry to keep you waiting.
Help yourself to anything in the fridge.<eos> Anything else?<eos> Well, now that you mention it, uh... I'm a little thirsty.<eos> Forgive me.<eos> Go easy in case we have more questions for you tomorrow.
So, I'm sure that whatever this turns out to be, you'll handle it the same ways you handled us...<eos> Ruthlessly and alone.<eos> Best of luck, Jamison.<eos> [Engine starts] I'm just here as a courtesy, Ms. Vaughan, to let you know that if your fiancé doesn't turn himself in in the next 24 hours,<eos> I'm going to have to charge you as a co-conspirator in his escape.
[Engine starts] I'm just here as a courtesy, Ms. Vaughan, to let you know that if your fiancé doesn't turn himself in in the next 24 hours,<eos> I'm going to have to charge you as a co-conspirator in his escape.<eos> You're gonna have a very hard time finding evidence to support that charge.<eos> Really?<eos> If I arrest you and take your cellphone, I won't find any evidence that he's contacted you in the last 24 hours?
Or they'll have caught me on camera.<eos> Got it.<eos> ♪ Let me tell, this is how it goes ♪ You're not Thor.<eos> Thor is dealing with some family issues in Asgard.<eos> I'll be taking care of you this afternoon.

Buy one, buy all!<eos> Masks for sale!<eos> May I have your attention please?<eos> Your royal highnesses, my lords, ladies and gentlemen, good evening.<eos> There's someone very special I'd like to introduce to you tonight.
Let's go, darling.<eos> The press is waiting outside.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> - Of course.<eos> I told you!
I told you!<eos> Mrs. Billimoria, huh!<eos> All hail the King!<eos> That's quite a sword!<eos> Should I gift it to you or would you like to snatch it?
I'm a heroine.<eos> We go to India.<eos> Tell us the way.<eos> Tell or else"<eos> Or else" he" he'll kill you.
We go to India.<eos> Tell us the way.<eos> Tell or else"<eos> Or else" he" he'll kill you.<eos> He'll kill you.
What if it rains for days?<eos> Will we just wait around?<eos> Yes.<eos> That's too much for me.<eos> Explaining something to you is as tough as making an elephant wear undies.
You won't tell anyone, will you?<eos> Actually" it's a birthmark.<eos> Do you know why God makes beautiful girls so foolish?<eos> Why?<eos> He makes them beautiful so that men like you can fall in love with them.
Do you know why God makes beautiful girls so foolish?<eos> Why?<eos> He makes them beautiful so that men like you can fall in love with them.<eos> And foolish?<eos> So they can fall in love with men like you.
Every road that leads to Burma now has a British post.<eos> Not even a bird could fly over to this side now.<eos> Ah Sergeant Malik!<eos> At ease.<eos> Mr. Billimoria wanted to see you.
Anything I can do to return the favour?<eos> - Thank you, sir.<eos> Anything?<eos> - It's really not necessary.<eos> Sergeant Malik, on Miss Julia's personal request, I'm recommending you for the Victoria Cross.
'That sword will lead our nation to freedom.'<eos> 'That sword will break the shackles of slavery.'<eos> Mail has arrived!<eos> Baldev, mail has arrived!<eos> This medicine is for you?
!<eos> All the world's a stage and the stage is mine.<eos> Ours!<eos> Ours!<eos> I have a surprise for all of you.
I wanted to tell you something important.<eos> Tell me.<eos> I'm embarrassed about what happened in the jungle.<eos> OK.<eos> And also a little mad at you.
I want to apologize.<eos> For what?<eos> This.<eos> You mean, this.<eos> On the contrary, I should thank you for this.
This.<eos> You mean, this.<eos> On the contrary, I should thank you for this.<eos> Why?<eos> I took advantage of you.
- Sure.<eos> Zulfi!<eos> My cursed fate!<eos> I'm going to get slaughtered over your love affair.<eos> Both of you will get yourself killed and drag me along too.
My cursed fate!<eos> I'm going to get slaughtered over your love affair.<eos> Both of you will get yourself killed and drag me along too.<eos> Listen, stay away from her.<eos> If her man finds out, he'll bury you both alive.
Listen, stay away from her.<eos> If her man finds out, he'll bury you both alive.<eos> Zulfi, my pistol"<eos> - To hell with it!<eos> Especially for you!
My beloved went to England Playing the band, who knows where he will land, lest Hitler is startled<eos> Beware, lest Hitler is startled Beware, lest Hitler is startled<eos> Beware, lest Hitler ls startled<eos> Here's to your entire company, Rusi.<eos> - Here's to you, David.
Mr. Rusi, for god's sake" We'll bury him.<eos> If you wish to be buried alongside him, you can go ahead and dig his grave.<eos> Dump the body in the jungle.<eos> He was an INA spy.<eos> Which of you knew that?
Dump the body in the jungle.<eos> He was an INA spy.<eos> Which of you knew that?<eos> Are there others like him..<eos> Amongst you?
I understand"<eos> - No, you do not understand!<eos> I can have you arrested for this.<eos> C'mon, David please"<eos> Excuse me, that's Major General Harding to you.
First your make-up man, HOW OUT nurse.<eos> And there could be many more.<eos> How did you find out?<eos> - That oldie ratted out for money.<eos> I tell you, if the British ever leave India, this is going to become one of the most corrupt societies in the world.
How did you find out?<eos> - That oldie ratted out for money.<eos> I tell you, if the British ever leave India, this is going to become one of the most corrupt societies in the world.<eos> What'll happen to him if you die?<eos> Have mercy for your child and tell me who else is working with you.
I'm white, I'm always right.<eos> Major"<eos> Take the gun.<eos> Take the gun, Mr. Billimoria.<eos> I told you to take the gun!
We need that sword.<eos> They won't spare my life.<eos> Trying to save me is pointless.<eos> Miss Julia.<eos> I promise a fair trial for Sergeant Malik and no case for you.
I couldn't even put weight on the foot. And, uh, so it was time for me to go home.<eos> Operational Detachment Alpha 0-7-2, they did their team photo standing in front of the Pirelli wall.<eos> And it was that team photo I brought to Rob's dad,<eos> Bob Pirelli.<eos> Above you are three C-1-30s, approaching the drop zone with over 174 lethal and highly motivated paratroopers on board.
And a marine recon scout who had also been blinded, and an army soldier who had lost his legs, and a ranger who had served in Somalia in the Black Hawk Down mission,<eos> Kenny Thomas.<eos> And at more than 14,000 feet at the top of this volcano... the lesson that I learned from these Special Operators... From these wounded warrior Special Operators, you don't quit.<eos> And it was that moment that I was able to prove to myself that I was back from the injury and that it was time to get back to Iraq.<eos> Neither one of you have ever heard this story.
- Once we get here, we have to identify a fit partner, foreign internal defense partner.<eos> And the party that we identified is the an-Nasiriyah SWAT. Special Weapons Attack team.<eos> So we had to select those operators that we felt would be effective in this area in order to set the conditions for sustainable security.<eos> Everybody, this on you, knock out ten push ups... and then we take a break.<eos> I'm not gonna count for you, but, you know, if you only do two, that's on you.
You remind me of my husband.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Tell you what.<eos> Today's your lucky day.<eos> I'm gonna graduate you on a probationary clause, which means if you are not in the top 10% of your department for conduct, safety, and citations, you're a fucking goner.
Let's see how much your boyfriend loves you.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> He's got David.<eos> - Who's David?<eos> One of you is gonna die.
Eventually, I did.<eos> That's why I said, "At the time".<eos> That's the defendant's wife!<eos> The defendant in your case!<eos> I hear you loud and clear, sir.
What are we gonna do, go and change it?<eos> Got it.<eos> Your name is Officer Francis Llewellyn Poncherello and you're transferring from CHP in Redding.<eos> Captain Lindel will be the only person that knows you're FBI.<eos> She put you with a rookie named Jon Baker.
All right, take care, man.<eos> Do you have a favorite artist?<eos> I have a favorite size.<eos> Backpack.<eos> We've just the piece for you.
Ponch is southbound.<eos> Change of plans.<eos> I'm going around.<eos> This is 7-MARY-4, we're heading towards some kind of fair.<eos> 7-MARY-4, we're right behind you.
- You're not gonna answer your phone?<eos> You're gonna make me fly to fucking LA to talk to you?<eos> My phone was broken.<eos> I was trying to activate it--<eos> I told you to stay away from that drug house.
That's standard, boss.<eos> - That's standard?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> Wow, things have changed!<eos> - Hey, it was great meeting you.
Holy shit!<eos> Slow down.<eos> Captain Lindel.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> What took you so long?
No.<eos> That smart, does it?<eos> I'll live.<eos> It's a nasty one, all right.<eos> Why did he attack you?
Dunn was looking for leads on Frick.<eos> It seems the Professor's been written out of history.<eos> But why use the mail?<eos> Jimmy must have seen that he was being followed... wanted to make sure this didn't fall into the wrong hands.<eos> A caution, no doubt, instilled by you.
Well, that's not your job.<eos> And he will come.<eos> Listen to me. Listen to me!<eos> We don't have much time.<eos> I can help you, Spode.
What do they get out of it?<eos> The escape of the King from SS custody would disgrace the SS and consolidate the Army's Commander-in-Chief in his position of power here, and not just here... the repercussions would be felt all the way to Berlin.<eos> We have the support of the general staff in this business.<eos> What's the catch?<eos> The General will see you both now.
So, the younger Spode is dead too?<eos> As I understand it, yes.<eos> And your police officer followed Captain Hesse here?<eos> That's right.<eos> I will come to you later.
Now, you listen to me, Major.<eos> If you want my co-operation, you're going to have to woo me,<eos> and I'm very difficult to please.<eos> You have the impertinent manner of the revolutionary.<eos> It will get you nowhere.
If you want my co-operation, you're going to have to woo me,<eos> and I'm very difficult to please.<eos> You have the impertinent manner of the revolutionary.<eos> It will get you nowhere.<eos> Let me remind you of your position...
and I'm very difficult to please.<eos> You have the impertinent manner of the revolutionary.<eos> It will get you nowhere.<eos> Let me remind you of your position...<eos> No. Let me remind you of your position.
_ _<eos> If there's any explaining to be done, then you'll do it.<eos> You're playing a dangerous game, Superintendent.<eos> Not nearly as dangerous as the one you're playing.<eos> If I submit a full report about young Spode's murder this afternoon, the German C-in-C of Great Britain will likely find it very healthy to distance himself from you, as will your colleagues in Berlin.
But surely she was followed too?<eos> The man assigned to her was not experienced enough.<eos> Not for an agent like her.<eos> You did not realise?<eos> A man like you?
Scientific formulae.<eos> Years of work, probably, and he burned it.<eos> They steal the papers and destroy them.<eos> These Resistance are playing a funny game.<eos> My guess is they'll try to contact you again soon.
Probably not the girl next time, could be anyone.<eos> Say yes to whatever they want.<eos> Get their proposition.<eos> Their proposition was to kidnap my son.<eos> To blackmail you.
Say yes to whatever they want.<eos> Get their proposition.<eos> Their proposition was to kidnap my son.<eos> To blackmail you.<eos> Show them they can trust you.
This is two weeks old.<eos> The only way it could have been smuggled into the country was on board the inaugural flight from New York.<eos> So there was a sympathiser on board the plane?<eos> I think that's an SS matter, sir, not police business.<eos> I happen to know that an American reporter from that flight, a Miss Barbara Barga, has been asking questions about you of our press attache.
Of course, you know Bernard Staines from Oxford days.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Bernard.<eos> I was coach of the eight when Douglas got his blue.<eos> Yes, I never see you at the Oxford and Cambridge, Douglas.
And you seem popular with her.<eos> Married woman.<eos> Divorcee.<eos> Hello, Archer.<eos> Good to see you.
Of course not.<eos> Why was I invited here this evening?<eos> Is there some connection with the Shepherd Market murder?<eos> Let's just stay on track, shall we?<eos> We need nothing of you. Except loyalty to your country.
We're at the knife's edge.<eos> What about this fellow Huth?<eos> Could he be of value to us?<eos> In what venture?<eos> There's bad blood between him and General Kellermann, they loathe each other, but how can that help you?
This isn't the way to The Dorchester.<eos> Who said I was still there?<eos> I'm renting now.<eos> My lady.<eos> I'd ask you in for a drink, but they need the cars back for the other guests.
So we know where everyone goes.<eos> Are you still with the girl?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Stay there.<eos> I'm sending someone to bring you to me.
- When did they find him?<eos> - 22:47 hours.<eos> Foot patrols on the clock, every two hours.<eos> Not exactly making things difficult for The Partisans.<eos> This is an announcement that they intend to kill you unless you do as they say. You realise that, don't you?
The office is in that way.<eos> Okay. Go ahead, yeah.<eos> On the couch?<eos> Yes.<eos> Well, so what brings you here today?
You know, like that-- What do you mean by that? By "go through you"?<eos> That she would... Outgrow me, maybe. Or figure me out or something.<eos> So i've always had this sense that-- That, you know, the day would come where she would just-- Where she would just not love me anymore, and--<eos> And i... I think i'm constantly looking for evidence that she--<eos> Evidence that she doesn't-- doesn't love you anymore.
Okay, our first order of business today Regards our annual fall gala fundraiser.<eos> Now, given the unprecedented success of last year's trivia night With the theme "dead celebrities," We've decided to come back again with yet another costume gala,<eos> I think it should make for a splendid... oh, god. ...Evening filled with fun, Fashion, frivolity,<eos> One which should raise some much-needed funding--<eos> And i'm looking at you, bruce pedulla--
He also brought up his father, who, believe it or not, he thinks might be Darth Vader.<eos> What?<eos> Children often get caught halfway between fantasy and... and reality.<eos> And he's only six.<eos> And I asked him if the two of you talk much about his father.
What?<eos> Children often get caught halfway between fantasy and... and reality.<eos> And he's only six.<eos> And I asked him if the two of you talk much about his father.<eos> He said it upset you and that you're not saying much about him.
Everybody lived to tell about it.<eos> ♪ It's our closest friend... ♪<eos> How's she doing? Any headaches?<eos> I'm fine! I'm fine.<eos> Did Ed send you?
- All right.<eos> Unfortunately, Amabella won't say who's involved.<eos> However, her mother is convinced that Ziggy is responsible.<eos> - But I'm not, nor is Ms. Barnes.<eos> - No, I'm not. Look, if it weren't for the incident on Orientation Day, I never would've called you in unless we had anything more definitive.
And that's a problem, I think.<eos> Do you think that's a problem?<eos> Well, I'm encouraged that you at least think of it as lovemaking.<eos> Because sex isn't always that.<eos> Does the sex you have with Perry ever strike you as violent?
I mean, I...<eos> I don't really remember.<eos> Have you ever sustained bruises from something other than sex?<eos> I don't follow.<eos> Your husband said he grabbed you too hard sometimes.
Because you're treating us.<eos> And only you showed up, so I'm treating half the couple.<eos> From what I know about your duty of care, you are ethically responsible...<eos> I throw off the ethical chains when I sense a patient in danger.<eos> He hurts you.
He hurts you.<eos> Oh, no. I... no, I didn't...<eos> I mean, I didn't...<eos> I didn't say that. He's...<eos> I mean... I pick up on things, not just from you, but from Perry.
I didn't say that. He's...<eos> I mean... I pick up on things, not just from you, but from Perry.<eos> We both become violent sometimes.<eos> I take my share of the blame.<eos> He hurts you.
- There are other reasons.<eos> - Okay. Such as?<eos> I'm madly in love with him.<eos> He adores me. He... he treats me like a goddess.<eos> When he's not hurting you.
We never fight in front of them.<eos> They never see anything.<eos> They're fine. They live in a happy household.<eos> They have no idea.<eos> - He will hit you again. - Yeah.
Go get drunk.<eos> Hey, I remember you guys from...<eos> - Why'd you come here? - Come on, dude.<eos> Move it along. There you go.<eos> How can I help you?
What's this guy's name?<eos> Holt Anthony.<eos> Not sure.<eos> It always takes me until Thanksgiving to start putting names to faces.<eos> Really? 'Cause he was supposed to do some sort of extra credit thing for you.
Why?<eos> I don't know.<eos> That girl.<eos> What girl?<eos> - Can I help you?
And I'd rather not talk about it.<eos> Ma'am, where's the church?<eos> Well, it's not a church anymore.<eos> I guess the worst part of it for me was that I let down my kids, I let down my husband.<eos> Raise your hand if life ever let you down.
So why isn't she there now?<eos> Well, because we paid mightily for this act of charity.<eos> It was as if God and nature itself wanted us to be rid of her.<eos> - The flood.<eos> But I had let myself believe, like you, that she was trying to tell me something.
He still lives in town. Although he isn't a priest anymore. Not since he went blind.<eos> I have to go.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Mr. Burke!<eos> It's Julia! I have to talk to you!
I am her mother!<eos> You shouldn't be her doctor, too. Excuse me.<eos> Is she sick?<eos> Did something happen?<eos> She went outside because of him. Because of you!
Please, Mom. It won't happen again.<eos> No, it won't.<eos> I'm sorry, Carla.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I know this is sad for you both. It is sad for me, too, but it is time for Carla to leave, now.
Please.<eos> Says here you were sentenced to six years for aggravated assault and battery.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - Served three and were due to be released on Friday.<eos> Shadow, we're going to be releasing you later this afternoon. You'll be getting out a couple of days early.
He takes care of everything, all the bills.<eos> I've just got to get back for his christening, and everything will be all right.<eos> You know what?<eos> He... He'll take care of me.<eos> We're gonna get you in First.
He... He'll take care of me.<eos> We're gonna get you in First.<eos> Get... Just get him in First.<eos> First class? Thank you. Yeah, you're gonna go right in first class.<eos> Okay? - Thank you.
First class? Thank you. Yeah, you're gonna go right in first class.<eos> Okay? - Thank you.<eos> - Don't worry anymore.<eos> - Thank you. - And mind your bag.<eos> - Watch your step. - Thank you.
Don't worry about me.<eos> I got an eye for these things.<eos> Just the one, but I can see that you're not used to the fresh air, but I don't see the joy of being out.<eos> Also, you lost something vital in there, not just time.<eos> What should I call you if I were so inclined?
Hippie parent.<eos> Mama had a big afro?<eos> "Dancing Queen,."<eos> Yeah. She had the whole kit.<eos> And if I was inclined, what might I call you?
You got more talent than me.<eos> I got two.<eos> One is I can sleep anywhere, any time.<eos> The other one is that I usually end up getting what I want... on average, over time.<eos> It's all about getting people to believe in you.
Don't rush into this. Take your time?<eos> No, thank you, but I already have a job waiting for me<eos> - at my buddy's gym.<eos> - No you don't.<eos> I could use a fellow like you.
There's always work for a big guy who's smart enough to know he's better off letting people think he's dumb.<eos> And by the way, did I mention the bonuses? Outstanding benefits.<eos> I'll even throw in a pension if you'd like, and I can tell you what the fuck a pension is.<eos> Hell, by the end of your tenure, you could be the next king of America.<eos> And I told you, I got a job.
Sir?<eos> I slept through first class.<eos> Sorry we had to make an emergency landing.<eos> Can't blame us for the weather.<eos> I can get you on a flight tomorrow that'll get you into Eagle Point by 6.
I can get you on a flight tomorrow that'll get you into Eagle Point by 6.<eos> How many miles is it from here?<eos> I've only been on three other dates from the computer.<eos> I-I don't think I have the talent for it.<eos> But meeting you...
Ask me about the job.<eos> I thought you'd want to reconsider on account of your friend Robbie's condition and on account of you being broke.<eos> What about his condition?<eos> The fuck do you know about Robbie?<eos> More than you, it seems.
Heads.<eos> Tails.<eos> I rigged the toss.<eos> Rigged games are the easiest to beat.<eos> It is always going to be tails because I don't want to work for you.
Who he really is?<eos> Well, I never.<eos> Mad Sweeney as I live and breathe.<eos> What a surprise.<eos> Southern Comfort and Coke for you. Jack Daniel's for me.
Well, I never.<eos> Mad Sweeney as I live and breathe.<eos> What a surprise.<eos> Southern Comfort and Coke for you. Jack Daniel's for me.<eos> And these are for you, Shadow Moon.
Of course I do.<eos> Name your price.<eos> I just want to go to my wife's funeral.<eos> Okay? I just want to say goodbye.<eos> Now after that, yeah, fine, I'll work for you for $2,000 a week.
I just want to go to my wife's funeral.<eos> Okay? I just want to say goodbye.<eos> Now after that, yeah, fine, I'll work for you for $2,000 a week.<eos> You want me to hurt people?<eos> I'll hurt people if they try and hurt you.
It was good fucking times.<eos> Kings didn't like that.<eos> Kings came one after the other to knock her off her throne.<eos> They didn't last long.<eos> When the queen was done with you... you were gone.
You separate a head from a body, that is strike fucking one across the bow.<eos> They all ain't going to take that lightly. Good.<eos> Wait 'til he sees strike two, when I get myself that queen.<eos> What about you?<eos> Spill blood together, that binds you to him for life.
Try that on for size.<eos> Is this Wisconsin? That's our next stop.<eos> Welcome to Kentucky.<eos> Now be nice to the lady we're visiting, but not too nice.<eos> She might take a fancy to you, and that would not be good.
Well, yeah, you could... you could call this Easter.<eos> Or we could call it what it really is: A pagan ritual, the celebration of the beginning of spring dating back about 12,000 years.<eos> So, when you see children dipping eggs in vinegar the colors of their favorite toys, or when you see the nation's youth fleeing south for copulation, or when they spread their seed over that sinking mass that is the great state of Florida, they all... without realizing it do it in her name.<eos> Ostara.<eos> It is a treasure and a treat to welcome you all to my home and on my day, my favorite day of the year.
Hi!<eos> My little girl!<eos> Come here!<eos> How are you?<eos> I love you too.
Wait, wait, wait.<eos> Sink.<eos> Now you're in the Sunken Place.<eos> 'Sup, man?<eos> They're workin' you good out here, huh?
'Sup, man?<eos> They're workin' you good out here, huh?<eos> Nothing I don't want to be doing.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I didn't get to meet you, actually, up close.
Logan King.<eos> Chris was just telling me how he felt much more comfortable with my being here.<eos> That's nice.<eos> Logan, I hate to tear you away, dear, but the Wincotts were asking about you.<eos> Well, it was nice to meet you, Chris.
I owe you an apology.<eos> How rude of me to have touched your belongings without asking.<eos> No, it's cool.<eos> I was just confused.<eos> Well, I can assure you, there was no funny business.
How foolish of me.<eos> It's fine.<eos> I wasn't trying to snitch.<eos> Snitch?<eos> Rat you out.
No, no, no.<eos> We're just very happy that you're yourself again.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I am. Hmm.<eos> And I thank God for you for calming me down.
We're just very happy that you're yourself again.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I am. Hmm.<eos> And I thank God for you for calming me down.<eos> I know that I must've frightened you all quite a bit.
Yes.<eos> Well, I'll have to let you all get on the rest of the night without the aid of my marvelous wit.<eos> The whole ordeal has made me quite a bit exhausted.<eos> Logan, you just get some rest.<eos> It was nice meeting you, Chris.
You hear that, Chris?<eos> Huh? You're one of her favorites.<eos> Chris?<eos> Hey, it's Chris.<eos> I'm either away from the phone or I just don't wanna talk to you.
I'm either away from the phone or I just don't wanna talk to you.<eos> Peace.<eos> Chris!<eos> Hey, it's Chris.<eos> I'm either away from the phone or I just don't wanna talk to you.
Yes, ma'am.<eos> You know all TSA issues should be brought up with your authorizing officer.<eos> Yes, ma'am, but this is not TSA business.<eos> Okay, don't call me "ma'am." Otherwise we're not gonna get along.<eos> How can I help you, Rod Williams from the TSA?
They're probably abducting black people, brainwashing 'em and making 'em slaves.<eos> Or sex slaves. Not just regular slaves, but sex slaves and shit.<eos> See, I don't know if it's the hypnosis that's making 'em slaves or whatnot, but all I know is they already got two brothers we know, and there could be a whole bunch of brothers they got already.<eos> What's the next move?<eos> And don't ever, ever say that I don't do nothin' for you.

White girls. Oh, they get you every time.
Shadow, we're going to be releasing you later this afternoon.
Your wife-<eos> ...she died in the early hours of this morning.<eos> Was a- an automobile accident...<eos> Also, you lost something vital in there, not just time.<eos> If I was inclined, what might I call you?
Was a- an automobile accident...<eos> Also, you lost something vital in there, not just time.<eos> If I was inclined, what might I call you?<eos> I could be Mr. Wednesday with a shake of the handed.<eos> How much has our man told you?
Now, how is that for a story?<eos> 'Cause that's the story of black people in America.<eos> Shit, you all don't know you black yet.<eos> You think you just people.<eos> Let me be the first to tell you that you are all black.
Shit, you all don't know you black yet.<eos> You think you just people.<eos> Let me be the first to tell you that you are all black.<eos> The moment these Dutch motherfuckers set foot here and decided they white, and you get to be black, and that's the nice name they call you...<eos> Let me paint a picture of what's waiting for you on the shore.
I like him.<eos> He's getting angry.<eos> Angry is good.<eos> Angry gets shit done.<eos> You shed tears for Compé Anansi, and here he is, telling you you are staring down the barrel of 300 years of subjugation, racist bullshit and heart disease.
Okay?<eos> I was just hijacked by a toad-skin-smokin' punk<eos> - in a virtual fuckin' limo.<eos> - Oh.<eos> Said to tell you that he's reprogrammed reality.
Your first bed as a free man.<eos> Enjoy it.<eos> Shadow?<eos> About that little shit in the big limo.<eos> An assault on you is an insult to me.
Here's a thousand dollars and a list of things to get.<eos> Don't like dropping in on friends empty-handed.<eos> Money situation's a little tight at the moment, so we can agree now you bring me receipts or you don't skim more than a reasonable 5 percent.<eos> Oh...<eos> I'm not gonna steal from you.
Huh.<eos> They beat your pretty face all up.<eos> I hate that.<eos> I hate that they were hurting you, Shadow.<eos> I would never do that to you, honey.
Who'd have thought you had it in you?<eos> He was underestimating you, sweetheart.<eos> They all are.<eos> Not a mistake I'll make.<eos> Yeah, well I don't want to work for you, I-Love-Lucy.
They all are.<eos> Not a mistake I'll make.<eos> Yeah, well I don't want to work for you, I-Love-Lucy.<eos> We're done.<eos> Whatever the old guys are giving you,
Hey, you ever wanted to see Lucy's tits?<eos> Lucy!<eos> Don't fight gravity, Shadow.<eos> I've been at this a while, not as long as some, but I've seen things.<eos> Guys like you end up a suicide every time.
No, Lucy herself came- This is so fucking crazy.<eos> - And like the rest of your life is sane?<eos> - Lucy talking to me from the TV is weirder by several orders of magnitude than anything that's ever happened to me.<eos> So far.<eos> Oh, at times the universe does seem to have singled you out for unique abuse.
Would I rather be ignored?<eos> Yes.<eos> Okay, yes, ignore me.<eos> Always better dead than forgotten.<eos> And no one is ever gonna forget you.
What- What the hell is this?<eos> - You don't have one.<eos> - I don't want one.<eos> Well, you need one.<eos> What if someone wants to talk to you?
There was drama in there.<eos> Someone gave you an envelope, you got anticipation.<eos> What's in there?<eos> So you'd open it very slowly.<eos> Every phrase chosen carefully 'cause they charge you by the word.
The secret is charm.<eos> Yeah, well, you either got it or you don't.<eos> Charms can be learned like anything else.<eos> Zorya Vechernyaya.<eos> He don't going to be happy to see you.
- That smell.<eos> - We have guest.<eos> We have two guests.<eos> Oh, Votan!<eos> Nice to see you, Czernobog, old friend.
For old times' sake.<eos> Hmm?<eos> Make dinner first.<eos> - I'd be happy to help.<eos> - I murder you first.
Hmm?<eos> Make dinner first.<eos> - I'd be happy to help.<eos> - I murder you first.<eos> Think your husband might beat you to it.
Yeah.<eos> You no die of cancer.<eos> Can you get out?<eos> I want you to get out!<eos> And take your man with you.
I want you to get out!<eos> And take your man with you.<eos> Or I will break him open...<eos> - Shh! Shh! - ...and I will choke you slowly with his heart.<eos> I'm not going with you anywhere!
- Never again.<eos> - They'll all be there.<eos> Everyone except you- ...each of them thinking they know what strong is.<eos> And if you're not there to show them otherwise...<eos> They respect you.
- They'll all be there.<eos> Everyone except you- ...each of them thinking they know what strong is.<eos> And if you're not there to show them otherwise...<eos> They respect you.<eos> They know you.
Said you needed him.<eos> There's always another way.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> No. Food is cooked.<eos> Zorya Vechernyaya invited you for dinner, right?
Eh, we never much care about skin, like the Americans.<eos> Where we're from, everyone has the same color, so we must fight over shades.<eos> Hmm.<eos> You see, my brother had light hair and beard.<eos> Me dark, like you.
I'll have to ask you to put your seat back for landing.
Dr. Harber, before we're live,<eos> I just wanted to say thank you for choosing me.
Dr. Harber, before we're live,<eos> I just wanted to say thank you for choosing me.<eos> Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.<eos> The rich history you have with other journalists...<eos> I chose you precisely because we don't have a history.
The rich history you have with other journalists...<eos> I chose you precisely because we don't have a history.<eos> Now, don't fuck it up.<eos> Fifteen seconds.<eos> People trust you... for decades have valued you.
It's a tough pill to swallow.<eos> At one point, so was the Earth being round.<eos> But, Dr. Harber, why did it take you six months to address us?<eos> Where have you been?<eos> It seems to me that I invited you here, to my home.
Isla.<eos> My name's Isla.<eos> I don't look like an Isla, though.<eos> Your first three years, you look like whatever name you're given, then by four, you either settle into your name or you just...<eos> - What about you?
I guess I'm good at seeing what makes somebody tick.<eos> Understanding who they really are.<eos> Weakness?<eos> I'm able to understand them, but I'm not able to care about them.<eos> If somebody mentions "subconscious" to you, what do you think?
I was told that I demonstrated an early ability to recognize spatial patterns, whatever that means.<eos> I always took it as one of those things a teacher tells to a parent to make them feel better about their shitty kid.<eos> Like, "Gordon is very good at drawing circles.<eos> Gordon draws circles at a more advanced level than the other children."<eos> These bunk beds really worked out well, 'cause they spared me the awkwardness of having to tell you I'm not gonna fuck you.
Okay, well, that's clearly not the woman from the video.<eos> Maybe they moved or something.<eos> Should we see if they have the new address?<eos> I don't know. I don't know.<eos> Can I help you?
I don't know what bullshit he hauled your way, but he never visited my father in the hospital.<eos> If he told you that, it's a lie.<eos> He called and said he was gonna visit him, but he never showed up.<eos> This is gonna sound really strange, but did Pat have a tattoo?<eos> He told you about that?
We have to destroy the machine.<eos> Hey, Thomas.<eos> Everyone wants to know what's going on.<eos> Welcome, everybody.<eos> Nice to have you all here.
Hey, Thomas.<eos> Everyone wants to know what's going on.<eos> Welcome, everybody.<eos> Nice to have you all here.<eos> I asked you to gather here today because I thought that we should be honest.
- I told you, you can't... You can't just run off on me like that, okay? I've told you.<eos> He was... He was just...<eos> He's all right.<eos> He was struggling a little bit in the water.<eos> I wanted to make sure he got back to you.
"we want to shoot a movie about Sarah Palin, and we want to call it "Nailin' Paylin."<eos> "Who's Nailin' Paylin?" which I thought was a great name.<eos> We want to use you, you're perfect for it.<eos> This is gonna kind of be a big deal.<eos> We hate to trouble you, but I'm afraid we have a flat tire.
Oh, I'm sorry, fellas, I don't speak Russian.<eos> Kremlin. It means...<eos> - How you say?<eos> - Tow truck.<eos> Well, in the spirit of foreign relations, I'm sure there's no harm in me letting the two of you in.
Well, in the spirit of foreign relations, I'm sure there's no harm in me letting the two of you in.<eos> Come on in.<eos> You know, the business lashed out at me.<eos> Girls thought I stole that scene because someone else got the phone call at my agency, but I insisted I did it.<eos> It was really weird how when you get popular, people who were nice to you last week just, like, venomously hate you and are talking about you behind your back.
I became so well known so quickly.<eos> A lot of mainstream actors knew who I was.<eos> They were as excited to meet me as I was to meet them.<eos> I was, you know, their first porn.<eos> - In the '80s when it was cool to be a porn star... - Yeah. ...and celebrities wanted to meet you,
Once my makeup was done, I'm on you.<eos> I'd be sucking your dick, I'd be kissing you, you know, and then have to redo my makeup.<eos> I'd get in trouble all the time because I wanted to be there.<eos> These two people sat on opposite ends of the sofa on their phones.<eos> And then they called, you know, "We're ready for you on set," and they just went and fucked.
But when I originally retired, I had no problem doing it because the business that I knew where you actually had sex, like, on beds and desks, and, you know, and it was like, you were having sex.<eos> It was, like, good.<eos> Now, oh my God, I need to do a sitz bath afterwards.<eos> I mean, they freaking kill you.<eos> It's like, it's all about pounding you into the next room, and choking you.
Mmm, I don't know if I'm done with it. I'm not shooting right now.<eos> Off and on, I went to the BunnyRanch for a minute and worked.<eos> I don't have any problem with Dennis.<eos> It's just that it's not for me, 'cause it's really way far out of town, and I don't like the money split there.<eos> They take half of everything and then charge you for room and board and different stuff as well.
The adult business and the escort business are two separate businesses. They want nothing to do with each other.<eos> In fact, years back, if you were escorting, you were blackballed in the adult industry.<eos> They would never hire you again on set if they found out you were escorting.<eos> You're supposed to be untouchable when you're doing film.<eos> And so that means not everybody can get to you to shoot you or... not everybody could get to you to have sex with you.
And some of the things people have investigated, for example, are things like post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety disorders.<eos> And while they may occur more frequently in that population, there's no evidence that their receiving sex for money caused that problem for them.<eos> Let's say I'm some unemployed guy or something in the middle of the country living in a trailer park, but I have the ware-for-all to be able to save $100 a week up so that on my birthday next year,<eos> Okay, she just fell off that pedestal, in my opinion. And she became less valuable to the industry.<eos> As soon as someone can have you for a price outside the industry, your value to the industry goes down.
You son of a bitch."<eos> I'm like, "Who are you?"<eos> He's like, "I watched you on Dogfart the other day."<eos> "You were fucking this blonde chick that I love and I never got to fuck her before."<eos> And you're like... It opens up avenues for you, you know what I mean?
So, I took my time with it.<eos> It took me 17 years before I did my first interracial scene.<eos> So, I took my time so that I wasn't burnt out and people weren't burnt out.<eos> Are you following me again?<eos> Told you to stop following me.
When the whole Sunny custody thing is happening... my ex had his lawyer, high-priced lawyer.<eos> I'm there, no lawyer... totally confused about the situation.<eos> I'm tatted.<eos> Judge is looking at what my line of work is.<eos> At one point, she put her papers down, looked me square in the eyes and said, you know, "What happened to you in your childhood"
Thanks, Clay.<eos> Clay?<eos> Yeah, sorry, what?<eos> Are you with us?<eos> Yeah, no, I am, I'm with you.
Oh, and the box of tapes should have included a map.<eos> I'll be mentioning several spots around our beloved city.<eos> I can't force you to visit them, but if you'd like a little more insight, head for the stars.<eos> Or, you know, just throw the map away and I'll never know... or will I?<eos> You see, in case you're tempted to break the rules, understand I did make a copy of these tapes, and I left them with a trusted individual who, if this package doesn't make it through all of you,
In fact, it ruined just about everything... as you'll soon see.<eos> And stick around, Justin.<eos> I'm not through with you yet.<eos> I know you probably didn't mean to let me down.<eos> In fact, most of you listening probably had no idea what you were truly doing, but you'll find out.
Starting at a new school can feel overwhelming.<eos> I just want you to have an ally.<eos> Two allies.<eos> Count me in as well.<eos> So, just to be clear, we should smile at you in the hallway too?
Good stuff, man.<eos> I do more jazz myself, but music is all good.<eos> It gets you through the day.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Listen, Clay, I would like to talk to you sometime about Hannah Baker.
Thank you for making the time.<eos> I-I, uh...<eos> I know how busy you are.<eos> No, not at all.<eos> What can I do for you?
I know you can't possibly know every student, but my husband and I, we're still trying to understand.<eos> At home, Hannah was...<eos> Well, I mean... sometimes she would run around the house singing show tunes in funny voices and showering us with hugs, and other times... she was quiet and moody and it'd be hard to get a word out of her.<eos> - But nothing she did told us she was... capable of...<eos> I'm afraid I'm going to have to stop you right there, Mrs. Baker.
I'm afraid I'm going to have to stop you right there, Mrs. Baker.<eos> I'm terribly sorry for your loss, and I wish I could offer you what you need, but I just can't.<eos> Now that lawyers are involved.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> What I'm saying is that, in light of your lawsuit, I shouldn't even be talking to you.
What are you saying?<eos> What I'm saying is that, in light of your lawsuit, I shouldn't even be talking to you.<eos> I see.<eos> So then why are you?<eos> You and your husband are members of our school community, and we want nothing more than to support you during this time.
She didn't say much.<eos> This lawsuit could cost the district tens of thousands, hundreds, and that's if we win.<eos> We're already getting calls from the media. Yeah.<eos> I understand.<eos> And she never came to you, for help?
That's a heavy question.<eos> That's, like, existential.<eos> Alex.<eos> Why don't you come with me.<eos> I been wanting to talk to you.
In our experience, relative to many other schools, we do not have a problem with bullying.<eos> Then why did that girl do it?<eos> That girl's name is Hannah.<eos> Mrs. Baker.<eos> It's so good to see you.
Um, can I...<eos> I need to go to the office.<eos> Hello, Courtney.<eos> Hi, Miss Douglas, how are you?<eos> It's so good to see you.
Could I please get 40 copies?<eos> I don't see why not.<eos> Hi. Lainie Jensen to see Principal Bolan.<eos> Of course.<eos> Um... He will be with you in a moment.
You don't want to do this.<eos> - You think I'm scared of you?<eos> - You should be.<eos> Fuck you!<eos> How many of you remember the Oh My Dollar Valentines?
But it was his fault.<eos> - No, it's your fault.<eos> - It's not his fault.<eos> Maybe it's all your faults.<eos> Did that ever occur to any of you?
I will get coffee. Uh...<eos> - Um, what's your drink?<eos> Double mocha with extra little chocolate sprinkles, please.<eos> Nice.<eos> How may I help you, sir?
He was at the game, acting strangely.<eos> The ref had to kick him off the court because he was trying to harass my son.<eos> But nobody saw who keyed the car?<eos> Kids get jealous.<eos> I'm asking you if anyone saw who keyed the car.
A special shout-out to Zach Dempsey, who crushed it with 28 points.<eos> In other athletic news, the Lady Tigers won their game by a score of 54-32.<eos> Thought you said this wasn't a test.<eos> 'Cause this looks like a test.<eos> It's not, Mr. Pratters, I assure you.
It's not, Mr. Pratters, I assure you.<eos> It is a character-building questionnaire that assesses personal strengths and weaknesses.<eos> Excuse me, Mrs. Bradley?<eos> Yes, Clay.<eos> How important was it to you to help Hannah Baker?
I almost forgot too.<eos> Forgot what?<eos> Courtney and Clay, these are our new foreign exchange students joining us this semester.<eos> This is Jhene, Fynn, Mahla and Deep.<eos> Uh, Courtney and Clay will be helping you out.
And why did she do it?<eos> Because the kids here treated her like shit!<eos> Jensen, that's enough.<eos> But no one wants to admit it, so they paint over the bathrooms and put up a memorial, because that's the kind of school that this is.<eos> Everyone is just so nice until they drive you to kill yourself.
-I'm not lonely.<eos> -Who may hurt themselves. Not gonna hurt myself.<eos> -Find their way out...<eos> -You don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Hey, screw you!
Well, I can tell you that our financial aid tends to go to students at the top of their class, with SATs above the 90th percentile.<eos> Great.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Of course.<eos> And if you don't have the money and don't really have the grades, a lot of the decision gets made for you.
I mean, I like her poem, I think, but I'm not sure I'd want to hang out with her.<eos> Well... duty calls.<eos> Hi, Clay.<eos> Hey, Mrs. Baker.<eos> I'm sorry to bother you at work.
You already think I'm lying. Look, I'm sorry, okay?<eos> About everything, all right?<eos> Please.<eos> SKYE:<eos> They suspend you?
Sometimes... things just happen to you.
Not what happens... but what you decide to do about it.<eos> Please, my wife.<eos> I was on the phone with my wife.<eos> Where's my phone?<eos> Sir, stay calm. We're gonna take care of you.
Was it a girl who called?<eos> I can't give you that information, ma'am.<eos> We have units responding to the scene now.<eos> Okay, good. Good.<eos> Is there anything else I can do for you?
What if we lose this lawsuit?<eos> Then the school walks away without having to acknowledge they're wrong, without changing the way they do things.<eos> We owe it to Hannah... to Hannah, to fight this.<eos> And we owe it to the next kid to make sure... this doesn't happen again.<eos> How can I help you?
He misses her very much.<eos> That's nice.<eos> He seems like a good kid.<eos> He's a very good kid, yeah.<eos> Tell me, how much is his life worth to you?
He's a very good kid, yeah.<eos> Tell me, how much is his life worth to you?<eos> Mrs. Baker, we shouldn't be having this conversation.<eos> Don't you think it's exactly the conversation that we should be having?<eos> My son is worth everything to me, as I'm sure Hannah is to you.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.<eos> My name is Clay.<eos> Well, what happened?<eos> Your husband was in an accident. He's alive.<eos> The paramedics said an officer would come tell you, but your husband wanted you to know right away, so I came.
Hello, how are you!<eos> Hi, Mr. Cantrell.<eos> Hey, Sheri.<eos> Hey, Clay.<eos> Let me help you to your chair.
The graffiti.<eos> Lainie's concerned that we painted over it, says it could be construed as destroying evidence.<eos> Destroying evidence.<eos> I'm not gonna let the school go down at the hands of whatever disturbed sophomore latched onto the term "Cum Dumpster."<eos> Okay? And I'm not gonna let them pin this on our staff or on you and Jane and me.
It was nothing.<eos> It was stupid.<eos> Didn't look like nothing.<eos> I've got a family of brawlers, that's what I got here.<eos> Trying to keep you two on the right side of the law.
Have a seat.<eos> What's going on, Sheri?<eos> I, um...<eos> I heard about people getting these subpoenas today for court, and...<eos> I... I just... I wanted to talk to you about...
- I deserve to be here.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> Because you don't like me?<eos> 'Cause I embarrassed you?<eos> - I'm getting it worse than any of you.
I mean, we had a milkshake once. It was just a Dollar Valentine's thing.<eos> Hannah didn't take it seriously?<eos> - Objection.<eos> - I'll rephrase.<eos> Um, did Hannah ever say anything to you that might lead you to believe that she did take it seriously?
It's just...<eos> I needed to talk. Is that okay?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> Come on.<eos> I was glad to see you on my calendar.
I see you in the halls.<eos> Yeah, well...<eos> Jessica Davis.<eos> Alex Standall.<eos> And I've seen you around with Courtney Crimsen.
So what's on your mind today?<eos> I wanted to talk about Hannah Baker.<eos> She pushed me away.<eos> I was thinking about how hurt I was, and I didn't even for a minute stop to think that... she was hurting too.<eos> Look, Clay... whatever happened to Hannah, between you and her, with other kids, she made that choice to take her own life.
Why did she make that choice?<eos> We can't know that for sure.<eos> What if we could?<eos> What if we knew what we did wrong?<eos> I don't think Clay Jensen hates you.
I don't know him all that well, but he doesn't seem the type to hate anyone.<eos> It's like it doesn't even matter what you say.<eos> Maybe it does.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Okay, I'm not following you.
The other night, I almost threw myself off a cliff.<eos> I'm glad you didn't.<eos> You may not feel that way in a minute.<eos> Why do you say that?<eos> Hannah Baker came to see you the day she died.
I didn't mean... that, I guess.<eos> So what happened, Hannah?<eos> How did you get here?<eos> Just... one thing on top of another.<eos> If I'm gonna help you, I'm gonna need you to be a little more specific.
When was the last time?<eos> A week ago.<eos> At a party.<eos> What happened at the party?<eos> She told you what happened to her.
At a party.<eos> What happened at the party?<eos> She told you what happened to her.<eos> Look, even if she did come to visit me... this is not something I can talk about.<eos> So, if I tell you that I'm going to kill myself, you can't tell anyone?
Hannah never told me she was thinking about killing herself.<eos> - But you did see her.<eos> - I didn't say that.<eos> You saw her.<eos> And she told you things were bad.
You saw her.<eos> And she told you things were bad.<eos> That she didn't care about anything, that she wanted everything to stop.<eos> When did you talk to her last?<eos> She told you how she got to that point.
Yeah, you could say that.<eos> Did...<eos> You don't want to talk about this.<eos> No, I do.<eos> Listen, Hannah, I'm not gonna judge you... but did anything happen that night that you regret?
No, I...<eos> A decision to do something with a boy that now you regret.<eos> Oh, my God, no!<eos> That's just what you assume?<eos> No, I'm just asking you.
- I know you can't.<eos> So let's talk about a hypothetical student who says she was raped but won't say who did it, or can't.<eos> When a student is assaulted, I'm required to go to the police.<eos> But I need to know exactly what happened, and who did it.<eos> If I tell you... will you promise me that he'll go to jail?
Actually, there is a way.<eos> Before she died...<eos> Hannah recorded 13 reasons why she killed herself.<eos> And you're number 13.<eos> And everyone who comes before you on these tapes knows what you did and didn't do.
I, uh...<eos> I have to apologize for not telling you everything.<eos> Hannah asked me to keep secrets for her.<eos> I wanted to honor that.<eos> But I've come to believe I need to share something with you.
Not yet.<eos> It's one of theirs, long range.<eos> We can listen in, keep track of them.<eos> So, if we're not going back, what are we doing, then?<eos> I think it's time we introduced you to Ezekiel.
Maybe.<eos> Morgan?<eos> How do you know each other?<eos> We go back to the start.<eos> Well, the King is ready to see you.
Oh, right. I forgot to mention that...<eos> Yeah, a tiger.<eos> This is Rick Grimes, the leader of Alexandria, and these are some of his people.<eos> I welcome you all to the Kingdom, good travelers.<eos> Now, what brings you to our fair land?
And then when she was gonna fill it up, she saw something in it.<eos> All right.<eos> The king had put that rock in the road because he knew the person who dug it out, who did something, they deserved a reward.<eos> They deserved to have their life changed for the good.... forever.<eos> I invite you all to sup with us and stay till the morrow.
Tick-tock.<eos> Chop-chop.<eos> And, Rick... if Daryl does turn up here two days from now, two months from now... hell, two years from now, just know there's no statute of limitations on this.<eos> Keep that hatchet handy.<eos> You're gonna need it if he turns up with you people.
Rick... can do anything.<eos> This group? They found me... here, so far from our home.<eos> What do you need?<eos> Just tell us... we'll get it for you.<eos> We'll show you what we can do.
Do you want a massage?<eos> Negan loves them. And I was a licensed therapist. You know, before.<eos> While I appreciate the gesture and your commitment to your assigned objective,<eos> I am fully aware that none of you ladies are here this evening of your own volition.<eos> Video games are all about me showing all of you a fun time.
You need to talk to Daryl about that.<eos> He wanted me to keep the whole story about you from everybody.<eos> Told me not to say where you were, and I did what you asked.<eos> Daryl didn't find you because of me.<eos> And what was said between you and him was said between you and him.
So it should be with me.<eos> - Then I'll go, too.<eos> - Me, too.<eos> No. The Hilltop has to be ready for what happens after.<eos> Maggie needs you.
They aren't the same ones who came to Alexandria.<eos> Simon!<eos> Hello.<eos> Right back at you, Gregory. Hello.<eos> We weren't, uh, expecting you back so soon.
Mental note. Locked.<eos> Great.<eos> Oh, no need to talk.<eos> This is hopefully a quick visit.<eos> Well, what can I do for you?
Shit you not.<eos> Almost forgot.<eos> Set that down.<eos> Well, fair is fair.<eos> We're not leaving you high and dry when it comes to medical solutions.
Get up.<eos> You're getting out.<eos> We're breaking you out.<eos> No.<eos> I'm not going with you.
Previously, on AMC's "The Walking Dead".<eos> Get up.<eos> We're breaking you out.<eos> I'm not going with you.
I was concerned.<eos> Where are your friends?<eos> They went out.<eos> They're looking for something they need.<eos> Without you?
This is just about what you have, what we need.<eos> Nobody's taking anything.<eos> You need to let everyone go and leave right now.<eos> Just walk away or this one dies.<eos> Yeah, we'll leave you alone.
No.<eos> Leave right now.<eos> Michonne, don't!<eos> We just wanna be left alone.<eos> Yeah, we'll leave you alone.
Some of you actually want to fight them?<eos> After everything?<eos> We can lose our guns, but us leaving this place to fight?<eos> After everything?<eos> I have to remind you!
Don't go anywhere.<eos> Everyone, shots within 10 feet of the line.<eos> That's it.<eos> Now!<eos> No. We're not fighting them with you.
Yeah. Yeah, we do.<eos> It's not just the ones I killed.<eos> I think about the people I didn't kill, too.<eos> We're gonna bring them back when it's all over.<eos> I-I want to go with you.
It'll hold.<eos> All points are covered.<eos> Every contingency is already met.<eos> I come armed with two barrels of the truth.<eos> A test is upon you, and I'm giving out the cheat sheet.
So, you don't like Eugene anymore.<eos> You guys gotta like Sasha.<eos> I do, too.<eos> Got her right here packaged for your convenience, alive and well.<eos> Now, I brought her so I wouldn't have to kill all of you, and not killing all of you could get complicated.
Daryl...<eos> Ooh, I gotta get me my Daryl back.<eos> I see you.<eos> And the pool table and all the pool cues and chalk.<eos> And I want it now or Sasha dies, and then all of you.
You can do it right in front of me.<eos> You can take my hands.<eos> I told you already...<eos> I'm gonna kill you.<eos> All of you.
He put himself in danger for you.<eos> And that started it all...<eos> From Atlanta, to my daddy's farm, to the prison, to here... to this moment now... not as strangers... as family... because Glenn chose to be there for you that day a long time ago.<eos> That was the decision that changed everything.<eos> It started with both of you, and it just grew... to all of us... to sacrifice for each other... to suffer and stand, to grieve, to give, to love, to live... to fight for each other.
You win, you go out on your own terms.<eos> You lose... they push you the fuck out.<eos> Couldn't finish.<eos> What happens if you lose again?<eos> Where does that put you?
Yeah, I guess.<eos> Maybe.<eos> I mean, I don't know.<eos> You know, I just...<eos> I'll tell you what.
Got it.<eos> Hello, uh, Andy.<eos> - Jay Kulina.<eos> - What do you want?<eos> I've been calling you for several days.
Is there a guy named Dominick here to see me?<eos> Yes. He is, um, on the mat with Juan.<eos> That shit, right?<eos> Very simple.<eos> It's there for you,
Not for me.<eos> I manage a lot of the fighters here.<eos> Do you have a problem with that?<eos> No, ma'am.<eos> I did my homework on you.
Do you have a problem with that?<eos> No, ma'am.<eos> I did my homework on you.<eos> You got a good reputation.<eos> People respect you.
Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> No, I'm...<eos> I'm, uh, super excited, super excited.<eos> I got to be honest with you.
Let's do it.<eos> Let's do it.<eos> Great.<eos> Come by tomorrow, and we'll get your paperwork done.<eos> God bless you.

Great.<eos> Come by tomorrow, and we'll get your paperwork done.<eos> God bless you.<eos> God bless you.<eos> God bless you, too.
Be free.<eos> Yeah, be free.<eos> Having fun?<eos> Yeah, it is very nice.<eos> All for you, my friend, all for you.
Shoney's.<eos> ...or the Series 9000 is going to turn it into mush.<eos> [ Farts ] Relaxed enough?<eos> [ Chuckles ]<eos> I admire you, Rick.
Pull me out.<eos> Roger that.<eos> Okay, have fun in what's left of my brain.<eos> I'm gonna transfer to yours.<eos> Oh, there's not enough room for all my genius, so I'm leaving you with my fear of wicker furniture, my desire to play the trumpet, my tentative plans to purchase a hat, and six years of improv workshops.
They're lame! Death Stalkers, bring me his flesh leather!<eos> [ Squeals ]<eos> Sorry, but can we not kill him?<eos> C-Can we just take him prisoner?<eos> When did I lose control here? Listen to me -- both of you kids need to get out of this environment so we can properly deal with your parents' divorce!
[ Squeals ]<eos> Sorry, but can we not kill him?<eos> C-Can we just take him prisoner?<eos> When did I lose control here? Listen to me -- both of you kids need to get out of this environment so we can properly deal with your parents' divorce!<eos> Alternatively, I have a freaking portal gun, and I can leave the two of you here forever!
Just tell me what you want.<eos> I want you and your sister to come home.<eos> Oh, but -- don't -- don't you have infinite versions of me and my sister?<eos> You don't have to kick me while I'm down, Morty.<eos> Look, there's no replacing either of you without an amount of work that would ultimately defeat the purpose.
Why do we have to go into the garage?<eos> You know [burps] it is [burps] required.<eos> I want to be alive!<eos> I am alive!<eos> Alive, I tell you!
I suppose that's a good segue into our little discipline cases here.<eos> Does Grandpa turn himself into a pickle a lot? What?<eos> ! No!<eos> What kind of question is that?<eos> The kind that wasn't designed to attack or hurt you in any way.
Fresh, fresh, fresh!<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, was this your friend?<eos> Don't worry, he died doing what he loved, being a dumb fucking rat.<eos> Aaaah! I didn't say my father is perfect, I said his work is important.<eos> And she's saying what's important is that Grandpa lied to you to get out of coming here.
I think it's possible that dynamic eroded your marriage, and is infecting your kids with a tendency to misdirect their feelings.<eos> Fuck you.<eos> - Mom!<eos> - Mom!<eos> Fuck both of you, too.
Put him on, and locate the phone he's using.<eos> Hello.<eos> Hi, um, can you, uh, please let me out.<eos> Your mere presence in this building violates international law.<eos> I couldn't let you out even if you hadn't killed two men.
And how is that?<eos> They didn't let me out.<eos> Solen'ya. Shut your mouth and do your jobs, you fucking children!<eos> Uh, is this not a good time or...?<eos> Some of my men are calling you "Solen'ya"...
Uh, is this not a good time or...?<eos> Some of my men are calling you "Solen'ya"...<eos> The Pickle Man, an old wives tale.<eos> He crawls from bowls of cold soup to steal the dreams of wasteful children.<eos> That'd be a lucky break for you.
Do it.<eos> Okay, you win, Pickle Man.<eos> I'm unsealing the building.<eos> No, thanks.<eos> I'm coming for you now.
That money belongs to the people.<eos> Shut up and call me a helicopter, you prick!<eos> Do we have a deal?<eos> ! Take that money, give it to Jaguar's daughter when you set her free.<eos> Or I'll be visiting you.
Look at this family go.<eos> You guys are pros.<eos> What do you guys think about doing this once a week?<eos> You must be Rick. Mm-hmm.<eos> I've heard a lot about you today.
You guys are pros.<eos> What do you guys think about doing this once a week?<eos> You must be Rick. Mm-hmm.<eos> I've heard a lot about you today.<eos> Your family is crazy about you.
What do you guys think about doing this once a week?<eos> You must be Rick. Mm-hmm.<eos> I've heard a lot about you today.<eos> Your family is crazy about you.<eos> Your daughter holds you in very high regard.
It's a serum that I need to, uh, to stay alive.<eos> I have had a rough day.<eos> And, uh, I've sustained a lot of damage.<eos> I'm pretty close to death, which the serum will prevent.<eos> By changing you from a pickle to a human.
When I feel like it.<eos> So... you asked.<eos> Rick, the only connection between your unquestionable intelligence and the sickness destroying your family is that everyone in your family, you included, use intelligence to justify sickness.<eos> You seem to alternate between viewing your own mind as an unstoppable force and as an inescapable curse.<eos> And I think it's because the only truly unapproachable concept for you is that it's your mind within your control.
You came here and defeated our arch nemesis... while so drunk you don't remember doing it?<eos> That's something "obvious" to you?<eos> Look, I'm a lit[burps]...<eos> little more complex than you guys, and, no offense, but I've always suspected that a lot of what you do in a year could be knocked out in a couple of hours.<eos> So I thought, why not just do your job for you, so we can have a little fun game.
Congrats!<eos> You did it [burps] it!<eos> It was a bit.<eos> All of the descriptors apply to all of you.<eos> Drunk Rick's point is that none of you are very special or different.
All of the descriptors apply to all of you.<eos> Drunk Rick's point is that none of you are very special or different.<eos> That's always his point.<eos> Let's just get through this as quickly as possible.<eos> Then we'll deal with the two of you.
We didn't just play good.<eos> That hand I got, ten hearts, that doesn't just happen.<eos> That's, what have you, fate or luck.<eos> Plus my steely gaze. Striking fear into the hearts of the elderly.<eos> I'm proud of you mister.
In a matter of hours, the governor and his wife will set sail from here aboard separate vessels to seek aid in our efforts.<eos> He to Port Royal, she to Philadelphia.<eos> I alone am to be left in charge of Nassau's security.<eos> And I gave our lord governor my solemn oath that I would see it protected... against any and all enemies.<eos> I look forward very much to be working with you to that end.
Israel Hands became jealous of Teach's affection and that it led to a falling out with the captain that was most humiliating.<eos> A degrading beating before all the crews on the beach.<eos> A pistol shot just missing his eye, rendering him a misshapen wretch.<eos> You talk too much.<eos> So, you can understand my confusion, given that Nassau's first king embarrassed you so thoroughly and so publicly, forbade any other crew from having you.
Who are you that I ought to pay you any mind?<eos> I'm no one.<eos> From nowhere.<eos> Belonging to nothing.<eos> I'm a wretch like you.
What are you doing?<eos> I'm through following you down a path only you seem able to see.<eos> Towards a victory only you seem able to define.<eos> We will hold our position here until we can find our way into Nassau and free the rest of the men.<eos> And we will do it without you.
I do not want to be your friend.<eos> What I want is for all of this to end.<eos> For it to end, you must end.<eos> I imagine I have some obligation to surrender you to Captain Berringer, but the spectacle he would make of your trial and execution would only fan the flames of what is burning in Nassau now.<eos> I am tempted to put the sword to you and your man both, and bury this story for good, but what am I... if I spend my days pleading for a return to civility and then do dark things under the cover of night?

Where is he now?<eos> He's in Phoenix.<eos> He left this morning.<eos> When are you gonna leave him, Celeste?<eos> When he hurts you badly enough?
Hey, you just got the wind knocked out of you.<eos> Hey, Mommy isn't feeling well today, so I'm going to take you guys to school.<eos> What's wrong with her?<eos> She's... she's okay.<eos> But that means that the monster will take you to school instead.
Jesus.<eos> It's one thing should he kill you, but God forbid you miss a party.<eos> You know, your husband is ill, Celeste, but so are you.<eos> There are... children in the house.<eos> I told you, he will not hurt the children.
Go knock them down.<eos> One more time, Nathan Carlson!<eos> Hey, here he comes. Here we go.<eos> - Go get 'em, guy. - I'm sorry.<eos> I need you to take the boys now to this address that I'm gonna give you.
Six men with you.<eos> They never looked my way as I stayed a considerable distance.<eos> Saw you meet two others late last night, one of them standing on just one leg.<eos> Saw it all.<eos> I had him follow you after you left town so abruptly last night.
I had him follow you after you left town so abruptly last night.<eos> I assume the one-legged man was Long John Silver.<eos> Would you like to tell me what the meeting was about?<eos> I was summoned by him in a failed attempt to extort money from me.<eos> I would hope that your spy also informed you that four of my six men attempted to arrest him and died in the effort.
I am giving you an opportunity to remedy your error and help me end this threat once and for all.<eos> I want the names of your sources.<eos> I am sorry, but I cannot do that.<eos> Cannot or will not?<eos> These men would turn on you in a blink of an eye.
I am sorry, but I cannot do that.<eos> Cannot or will not?<eos> These men would turn on you in a blink of an eye.<eos> Why would you go to such lengths to protect them?<eos> I told you,
You fucking cowards.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> - Billy.<eos> - Yep.<eos> - Tried to kill you? - Yep.
It would help if Nassau knew I was coming.<eos> Can you see to it?<eos> Of course.<eos> I don't make this request lightly.<eos> But after everything Max has done for the council, for you, it seems like a moment when she's owed something back.
And who is that serving?<eos> Because there is a better way to solve this problem.<eos> What is that?<eos> This is information about the preferred routes used by the resistance to enter into Nassau.<eos> - She gave it to you?
Ooh, higher.<eos> I'm gonna miss this cast.<eos> Yet you never asked to sign it.<eos> Hey, Chief.<eos> A guy just came in and says he needs to talk to you.
Is he Tinfoil Hat or a Kenneth?<eos> Neither.<eos> Knows you from New York.<eos> Says you guys were hunting buddies.<eos> Christ, it's good to see you.
Good to see you, too.<eos> - Well, you remember me, right? - Yeah.<eos> - Dean.<eos> - Of course. Dean, yeah.<eos> What can I do for you?
- Of course. Dean, yeah.<eos> What can I do for you?<eos> You know, probably I... I should hold back on the details until I can provide you with unassailable proof, but if I'm being completely honest, it's... it's a little out there.<eos> Sure.<eos> I tried to keep you out of this, but I gotta regretfully inform you that our prey... previously unsophisticated and easily killable... has adapted.
So, Wyoming Senator Y. Woodrow Huffman... the incumbent, mind you... has a swanky fundraiser a week back.<eos> Food's high-class, all right?<eos> Crab cakes, Cornish game hens.<eos> But this motherfucker Huffman, he asks me for a peanut butter sandwich.<eos> He asked you for...
I'm gonna grab something upstairs.<eos> - No problem. I'll see you later, Kev.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> All right.<eos> Okay, now listen. I know there's a part of you that's hoping that he didn't even know it was your birthday.
I was worried you had forgotten.<eos> Don't usually get so many so close together.<eos> Love is in the air.<eos> Um, a little extra for your trouble.<eos> Sarah, does the name Kevin mean anything to you?
Uh-huh. With batteries.<eos> Very nice.<eos> I don't think that a ten-year loan would be prudent at this time.<eos> For our bank.<eos> With you.
There's how old you are, there's how many birthdays you have left...<eos> How much pubic hair you have left.<eos> See? No stopping her.<eos> Come on, Frankie, let's get out of here.<eos> I'm going to paint a very unflattering portrait of you.
It's a whole village of...<eos> Barry!<eos> Barry, say hello to my favorite mother!<eos> Mom, you remember Barry from the office.<eos> It is so nice to see you again, Grace.
And now I see Sol.<eos> Oh, Sol.<eos> That guy's really got a pair on him.<eos> Don't worry, I got it.<eos> - It is so nice to finally meet you.
I told you that drinking game bothers me!<eos> That little bag of soap bothers me.<eos> You know what? You guys suck.<eos> So sorry, I'm new here, so...<eos> Allison's great. Unlike you, she's kind. She has a big heart.
You know what? You guys suck.<eos> So sorry, I'm new here, so...<eos> Allison's great. Unlike you, she's kind. She has a big heart.<eos> Oh, we know, she told us about that condition.<eos> Fuck you all.
So sorry, I'm new here, so...<eos> Allison's great. Unlike you, she's kind. She has a big heart.<eos> Oh, we know, she told us about that condition.<eos> Fuck you all.<eos> I like her more than I like you people right now.
What the fuck?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I really should have listened to my husband.<eos> The truth is I've never been comfortable with people being angry at me.<eos> And now that includes you, Kenny Loggins.
Oh, wow. And the yellow makes me feel hopeful.<eos> Really?<eos> I just put the yellow in because my ex-husband hates mustard.<eos> - But I like your interpretation better.<eos> Would you like to take the happy time home with you?
Be sincere<eos> You're the one I love most<eos> Master, ours is just a small enterprise.<eos> What you see is all we have.<eos> If it's not enough for you, then all we can offer is our lives.
You're the one I love most<eos> Master, ours is just a small enterprise.<eos> What you see is all we have.<eos> If it's not enough for you, then all we can offer is our lives.<eos> First, I'm not here to extort anything from you.
- Why don't you go?<eos> - Stop quarreling, I'll go.<eos> Almsgiver, excuse me.<eos> I was just passing.<eos> May I trouble you for water to boil rice?
If you don't, I'll beat you to death!<eos> Really?<eos> Why?<eos> Scum!<eos> I told you to hit me.
What?<eos> You finished her before I had a chance!<eos> What were you thinking?<eos> You were in great danger.<eos> She could have swallowed you whole.
You're lucky I strike fast. I took her out with one blow.<eos> How many times have I told you?<eos> To conquer a demon, educate it.<eos> Didn't you see the smile on her face just now?<eos> Smile? She smiled at the prospect of eating you.
Smile? She smiled at the prospect of eating you.<eos> Outrageous!<eos> That smile was so sincere.<eos> My smile is even more sincere.<eos> Guess: Do I love you? Or will I kill you?
That smile was so sincere.<eos> My smile is even more sincere.<eos> Guess: Do I love you? Or will I kill you?<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> How can I help you?
All right.<eos> If that's what you really want, I'll indulge you.<eos> So it's clobbering time.<eos> Wait, give me a moment.<eos> I was just toying with you, Master.
Most flattered.<eos> Master Tang's reputation precedes him.<eos> And your three brilliant companions are also awe-inspiring.<eos> I learned that the four of you would pass by here.<eos> The king sent me to greet you here.
You yearn for her.<eos> You can't forget her.<eos> I'm afraid you're wrong, there's not.<eos> Learning humanity is like having religious faith.<eos> Following your heart will keep you young.
Simply fawn on him and you'll be well-rewarded.<eos> I'll expect my cut, of course.<eos> That's....<eos> I'm just joking. You didn't think I was serious?<eos> Look, our beauties are greeting you.
- I see.<eos> It doesn't seem so.<eos> Doesn't seem what?<eos> Your Majesty, I have a dream.<eos> We can perform a bit for you.
He hit me.<eos> He hit me!<eos> Hurry! Quick!<eos> You must flee right away if the king cries.<eos> Master, I did my best to help you but after what just happened, I'm afraid that your reputation cannot be repaired.
Did you ever think how it feels to demean yourself in front of people?<eos> Now you know what crazy dancing feels like. So you know how bad I feel!<eos> You tell me to kneel like a dog before you. You know how humiliating that is?<eos> You're right.<eos> I did manipulate you.
Now that you've said all that...<eos> - ... I'll finish you off with one slap!<eos> - Go ahead!<eos> I'm ready for it. I'd rather die than suffer this torture.<eos> All I wanted was to tell you:
Your Majesty, please calm down.<eos> - Monk Tang has something to say.<eos> - Your Majesty, please calm down.<eos> What happened before had nothing to do with me. It was all caused by my errant disciple.<eos> So I've brought him to apologise to you.
The king.<eos> Your Majesty!<eos> Thank you, Your Reverences.<eos> We have our real king back at last.<eos> We've prepared lavish gifts for you.
- You think we're vain?<eos> We're sacrificing ourselves on the altar of love!<eos> Monk Tang, get out! Protect our love!<eos> Monk Tang, get out! Protect our love!<eos> See how they love you?
- Who are you?<eos> I'm Second Brother.<eos> Isn't my true face completely irresistible?<eos> Sometimes when I look in the mirror, my beauty stuns me.<eos> Second Brother, Brother Monkey is watching you.
I'm handsome, does that bother you?<eos> I've been bothered about you for a couple of days.<eos> You don't even have hair.<eos> Felicity is quite good-looking.<eos> Why did she pass up being a queen to follow you instead?
You don't even have hair.<eos> Felicity is quite good-looking.<eos> Why did she pass up being a queen to follow you instead?<eos> What's on your mind?<eos> She's actually a demon, she plans to eat you.
There are many kinds of demons.<eos> Some are easy to spot others aren't.<eos> So you have no proof.<eos> It's not hard to check.<eos> You've let her looks blind you.
So you have no proof.<eos> It's not hard to check.<eos> You've let her looks blind you.<eos> Get on her case.<eos> Do I have to tell you how?
Still pretending! You can't do it!<eos> Don't believe me, asshole?<eos> No!<eos> Please don't strike your master.<eos> Stop, I beg you!
You thought we were fooled by Felicity.<eos> You thought she could sow discord between Monkey and me.<eos> But you underestimated Monkey's vision.<eos> The skeleton-demon conjured up the village and we pretended to be fooled by it, as you hoped.<eos> We tricked you into revealing yourself.
Two Buddhas!<eos> Monkey. Monkey!<eos> Immortal gold vulture you have cultivated yourself beside me yet you do not understand.<eos> No wonder you spread sophistry in the world.<eos> Lord Buddha I live for you.
You gave it to me.<eos> It doesn't suit you, it makes you look awful.<eos> You should have said so, you can have it. Hand it over!<eos> Why are you running off?<eos> - I've given it to you.
That's what he said.<eos> This VM Vargas?<eos> Yes.<eos> And we should have...<eos> At the time when we needed the loan, we should have come to you.
I'm just assessing the level of stupidity.<eos> - Hey, hey.<eos> - Irv, come on, we don't have to...<eos> You get a lot of business from us.<eos> Which, boychik, will stop the moment they arrest you for money laundering.
Pardon?<eos> Ni hao is the Chinese.<eos> The Corsicans use the simple salut.<eos> And guten Tag, if German's your thing.<eos> Is that... Are they with you?
Look what that animal did to my car!<eos> Madeline, call my wife, will ya?<eos> Madeline?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't realize Mr. Stussy was expecting you.
I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't realize Mr. Stussy was expecting you.<eos> - Mr. Stussy... - It's okay, Madeline,<eos> I got it.<eos> What can we do for you, friend?
Well, we are.<eos> So...<eos> Sorry, I was dealin' with the... What?<eos> Your...<eos> Did I tell you what I like about this place, Minnesota?
We are not partners.<eos> That...<eos> This... - You lent us some...<eos> - Capital.<eos> Which we've told you, we're happy to pay back with interest.
That...<eos> This... - You lent us some...<eos> - Capital.<eos> Which we've told you, we're happy to pay back with interest.<eos> You see, that's the problem with you Americans.
You see, that's the problem with you Americans.<eos> You watch too many movies, and you think the deal can always be changed, and it can't.<eos> We're partners now, and that's all there is to it.<eos> So, you might as well just lie back, as they say, and enjoy yourselves.<eos> Let me tell you what it is that attracts me to the parking lot business, yours in particular.
And the motel's getting pretty expensive.<eos> Relax, kid.<eos> I got you covered, totally.<eos> Just make sure you keep all your receipts.<eos> Mr. Beatty for you, sir.
Not really.<eos> Mostly flannel.<eos> Think I'll get it back?<eos> I wouldn't hold your breath.<eos> Hey, while I got you, I got some info I need run.
Or, no, I still am. Anyway...<eos> I thought in the spirit of inter-collegial understanding...<eos> See, I'm in town looking into a homicide, and the victim spent some time here, back in the '70s.<eos> Right.<eos> Okay, I'll tell you what. The plate number checks out, I'll come find you.
"Diet pop."<eos> You're...<eos> You're too much.<eos> Hey, so after we talked, I tried, uh...<eos> I tried to friend you on Facebook.
I'll, uh, check that out.<eos> Yeah!<eos> Yeah.<eos> So, did you find anything?<eos> About when I called before, asked you to look up that fella, Thaddeus Mobley, lived here in the 1970s? Right.
So, he was, what?<eos> Like, your dad?<eos> Sorta.<eos> You're a real chatterbox, huh?<eos> I can't get a word in edgewise with you.
I can't get a word in edgewise with you.<eos> Good thing you're so hot!<eos> Charm police?<eos> I got a major felon right here.<eos> I'm only teasing you, though.
You don't got teasing in Minnesota?<eos> I don't sound like that, do I?<eos> I mean, yeah.<eos> Look, uh, I'm just...<eos> I'm just kidding with you.
Sorry.<eos> That's my name.<eos> He was Thaddeus Mobley.<eos> Wait here.<eos> Howard, there's someone here to see you.
_<eos> I'm a police officer.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> I had a few questions for you about a writer you worked with back in 1975.
_<eos> I had a few questions for you about a writer you worked with back in 1975.<eos> Thaddeus Mobley.<eos> _<eos> He wrote a script for you called The Planet Wyh, a science fiction film?
Thaddeus Mobley.<eos> _<eos> He wrote a script for you called The Planet Wyh, a science fiction film?<eos> And, well, he was the victim of some malfeasance recently, and I'm just trying to connect the dots here.<eos> I know he was writing a movie for you, and then, I don't know, something happened.
Shit.<eos> Okay, folks, in a few minutes, we'll be beginning our descent into Minneapolis-Saint Paul where the temperature is a balmy 23 degrees.<eos> Unit M-N-S-K-Y.<eos> I can help!<eos> We, the Federation of United Planets, want to honor you for your service.
I do.<eos> I'm not trying to stir things up.<eos> No, I think you are.<eos> I think you got resentments over being made to cow, kiss the ring.<eos> I had boys like you in the service.
Just paid her wagon off, apparently.<eos> That sounds like an insurance matter.<eos> Yes, sir, except the driver in question left the scene of the accident at speed, and that's police.<eos> Well, like I said, am I talking to myself here, or...<eos> Soon as the girl's in tomorrow, I'll have her call up that info, and we'll get it over to you.
I'm already rich.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> I wish you'd let us sit at the real table.<eos> In the dining room.<eos> I'll let you into a secret, madam.
The stamp.<eos> The famed Two-Penny Red U.S. misprint.<eos> If I'm not mistaken, the "2" was the wrong way around.<eos> How do you...<eos> It's all very Old Testament, really, this feud between you and Raymond.
Oh, you think the IRS won't...<eos> This is what they do.<eos> Catch cheats.<eos> Middle managers and movie stars, people who park their money in a Denver Wells Fargo under their mother-in-law's maiden name.<eos> But I assure you, the IRS could not unravel an intricate web of shell companies and loan-outs with secret accounts in Monaco, Luxembourg, and the Cook Islands, if you gave them the account numbers.

- and gets away with it.<eos> - Easy, baby. You'll get your chance.<eos> But first, we gotta know the play.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Mr. Stussy, these ladies are here to see you.
- Ray?<eos> - Yes, sir. And that got us wondering, especially since Mr. Stussy, Raymond, his car got rammed into by another vehicle registered to your company and...<eos> Allegedly, words exchanged between Ray and a yet-to-be-identified member of your team.<eos> - My team? - Yes, sir.<eos> And we thought it curious the house being targeted and searched as it was that he shared the same last name as you and your brother.
- My team? - Yes, sir.<eos> And we thought it curious the house being targeted and searched as it was that he shared the same last name as you and your brother.<eos> The same first initial. Lived in towns with similar names.<eos> What are they...<eos> Is there some kind of feud between you and Ray?
Sir, was there some kind of disagreement over money between you and your brother? Or if not money, something he wanted back?<eos> - Reason we ask is...<eos> You're saying... My brother was trying to rob me?<eos> All right.<eos> I'd like to thank you for bringing all this to our attention.
- Reason we ask is...<eos> You're saying... My brother was trying to rob me?<eos> All right.<eos> I'd like to thank you for bringing all this to our attention.<eos> And to assure you that if anything fruitful comes to mind, any details that you might find illuminating, then we'll make sure to bring them to your attention, all right?
Things of consequence rarely happen by accident.<eos> Can you come?<eos> Give me the address and I'll leave immediately.<eos> I'm at Ray's.<eos> Did anyone see you?
He'd been abusing her, you see?<eos> Beating her in places you don't show.<eos> And tonight she'd had enough, so she cut his throat.<eos> And watched him bleed.<eos> Now, the police will contact you tonight to inform you of his death.
Me and my late husband. We started in mortuaries.<eos> Ah, just another kind of storage, I suppose.<eos> That's what my Tovaldt used to say.<eos> Both good businesses. Steady. Mmm.<eos> Heck, maybe we should be buying you out. - Oh...
But...<eos> Thanks. Heck, you don't get where I am by sticking to the plan.<eos> - To new friends. New friends.<eos> He's dead, in case you couldn't tell.<eos> Lady cop who printed you said you're a little tender.
Around the middle, maybe?<eos> Got some bruises.<eos> See, I'm a simple guy.<eos> When it snows, I put on boots. Sun comes out, I wear shades.<eos> I see a girl like you and a guy like that, I think... "Now, how's a working man with hillbilly hair and a beer belly
You don't have to be a mathematician to add two plus two.<eos> No. Your best bet?<eos> Tearjerker.<eos> What a monster he was.<eos> How he beat you every night where it wouldn't show.
Especially given the new victim...<eos> Get back to traffic enforcement.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> And you, I got no jurisdiction over you, but this is St. Cloud Metro's case now.<eos> So, if we need you or your grid, we'll give you a holler.
Uh, you can't be in here, sir.<eos> Library is closed.<eos> You're here.<eos> Well, sir, I work here, so that's...<eos> I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
I just did.<eos> What?<eos> You asked, then I left.<eos> I'm not here.<eos> Well, that's... I see you.
We gotta do an autopsy by law.<eos> Who was that fella, the one with the syringe?<eos> Nikki.<eos> What?<eos> We both know he came here to kill you for something you saw or something you know.
I got a boy at home that can't sleep at night 'cause somebody murdered his grandpa and he's afraid they might be coming for him next.<eos> Follow the money.<eos> You know what?<eos> Your probation is revoked.<eos> We're transferring you to the state pen.
Protective custody.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> You know, forensics is doing a test on the syringe.<eos> You ask me to place a bet?<eos> I think it takes a jury 10 minutes to convict you, nutbag with a syringe or no nutbag with a syringe.
You know, forensics is doing a test on the syringe.<eos> You ask me to place a bet?<eos> I think it takes a jury 10 minutes to convict you, nutbag with a syringe or no nutbag with a syringe.<eos> You like pie?<eos> I'm gonna visit you after the holiday, bring you some pie.
Parking lots.<eos> The final piece to the storage triptych.<eos> People are always going to need a place to park.<eos> Amen.<eos> I'll be honest with you, Mr. Feltz.
People are always going to need a place to park.<eos> Amen.<eos> I'll be honest with you, Mr. Feltz.<eos> At my age, I'm not looking for a partner.<eos> My preference would be to acquire the entire company, Stussy Lots Ltd., and I would be happy to let you keep the name intact if that worries you.
You wanna come inside, or...<eos> Better you come to the station with us. Cleaner.<eos> Okay.<eos> I gotta be back by 6:00. There's... I got an appointment.<eos> Oh, sure, we'll have you back.
Look, it's a family matter is my philosophy.<eos> Whatever past disagreements, bygones.<eos> You know?<eos> Think of Jesus, His actions.<eos> So, there's bad blood between you and Mr. Feltz? - No, I wouldn't say...
'Cause I got...<eos> Literally, my conscience is clear.<eos> - Your conscience? - Right.<eos> I'm saying if we're being honest here and not to cast aspersions, but I've seen a lot of snakes in my day, and that man is a scorpion.<eos> So, whatever he told you, I'd take that with a huge sack of salt.
And, um, just so I'm clear, when's the last time you...<eos> One sec.<eos> - We said 6:00, yeah?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Sheriff, before you...
I'll talk to him.<eos> That's all I ask.<eos> Any calls?<eos> I left the slips on your desk.<eos> Also, there's a man waiting to see you.
No, no, if you wanna go to the mall, that's...<eos> Lake sounds...<eos> And I know you're not little.<eos> I mean, you're practically all grown up.<eos> Phone's for you, chief.
I'm gonna go.<eos> If you have any more questions, let my lawyer know.<eos> It's done.<eos> They're letting him out.<eos> Doyle'll drive you to meet the swango, I'm moving to stage five.
If you have any more questions, let my lawyer know.<eos> It's done.<eos> They're letting him out.<eos> Doyle'll drive you to meet the swango, I'm moving to stage five.<eos> Loved you in deathofasalesman.
And I want my money.<eos> You just added another two zeros to your salary.<eos> What's in the briefcase?<eos> Where are my things?<eos> Well, now, Willy loman, I feel I ought to punish you for not doing what you were told.
So maybe I share one of the hard drives with the police.<eos> You... You can't win this game, you do realize that?<eos> I thought you didn't play games.<eos> I'm offering you a fortune, you're asking for a piggy bank, pourquoi?<eos> Because I wanna hurt you.
I thought you didn't play games.<eos> I'm offering you a fortune, you're asking for a piggy bank, pourquoi?<eos> Because I wanna hurt you.<eos> Not be your pet.<eos> I wanna look you in the face and rip out something you love.
Wasn't emmit who came for me in the precinct.<eos> Wasn't emmit who flipped that bus.<eos> You know, I didn't have any feeling about you before, but now I'm starting to really dislike you.<eos> Good.<eos> I'll give you till tomorrow to get my money.
Spreadsheets, uh, contracts, loan agreements.<eos> Not sure how you found me.<eos> He's protected, I think, Mr. Stussy, possibly even at the highest levels.<eos> My investigation was kiboshed last year from DC, so, we should proceed with the utmost...<eos> Look, Mr. Dollard. I don't know what to tell you.
You'll need to file for Chapter 11 immediately.<eos> But don't worry.<eos> Your personal wealth, the profits you've made as a partner in this venture, have all been carefully hidden. So...<eos> Not all bad.<eos> Mike and Mike will show you out.
Not a parking lot, folks.<eos> - Side of the road.<eos> - I know.<eos> It's kind of a long story, but in the end of it, we all go home, so...<eos> Thanks for stopping, it's real Christian of you.
I'm a citizen of the air, Madam.<eos> Moving, always moving.<eos> You don't remember me, do you?<eos> Surmise.<eos> Because I haven't greeted you, I don't remember you.
They got phones in Belgium, yeah? E-mail?<eos> Mr. Varga.<eos> You're asking me if there are phones in Belgium?<eos> Let me tell you what's gonna happen next.<eos> Three agents from Homeland Security are gonna put handcuffs on you and take you to Rikers.
Mr. Varga.<eos> You're asking me if there are phones in Belgium?<eos> Let me tell you what's gonna happen next.<eos> Three agents from Homeland Security are gonna put handcuffs on you and take you to Rikers.<eos> And then we're gonna charge you with felony money laundering and six counts of conspiracy to commit murder.
I am of Death.<eos> You are dead, Mrs. Fadil.<eos> - That is me?<eos> - That is you.<eos> Your family will come soon and find you.
- That is you.<eos> Your family will come soon and find you.<eos> They will do right by your body and bury you as is proper.<eos> They will be sad for a time, then they will find happiness again.<eos> Your Assaf will marry in a year and name his first daughter for you.
Who taught you the ways of Egypt old, of when the Nile was full and flooding.<eos> She told you stories of the Wolf and the Jackal, the Red Wind, and of the Child of Bast.<eos> - I remember.<eos> - You do.<eos> For that, I bring you to the Scales.
I was unkind to the first boy who loved me.<eos> I stole a doll once from my cousin.<eos> I tried... my best.<eos> Your best is good.<eos> Each will take you to the Du'at.
He beat me, and I would like not to see his world.<eos> Choose.<eos> You are a kind boy.<eos> You choose for me?<eos> Are you sure I do this with you?
You keep giving away your life.<eos> You don't much care if you live or die, do you?<eos> The world's not what I thought it would be.<eos> You'd rather die than live in a world with bears in the sky.<eos> I can help you.
The world's not what I thought it would be.<eos> You'd rather die than live in a world with bears in the sky.<eos> I can help you.<eos> - First, you must do something for me.<eos> Gotta fight you?
- You okay there?<eos> - I am not.<eos> - Where you headed?<eos> - Wisconsin.<eos> Take you as far as Madison.
There's a lotta need for Jesus, so there's a lotta Jesus.<eos> Now, the Mexican Jesus came here the same way a lot of Mexicans do. Illegally.<eos> No, that's not being racial.<eos> You can ask Him.<eos> He'll tell you.
Suppose I'll just be one more in a long line of men to climb on top of your dead wife.<eos> Be nice.<eos> - I'll see you in Wisconsin.<eos> Good luck, Mad Sweeney.<eos> I'll see you back at the car. Just make sure he doesn't steal it?
Good luck, Mad Sweeney.<eos> I'll see you back at the car. Just make sure he doesn't steal it?<eos> Now, you're gonna do a little light shopping at the grocery store.<eos> Pass a little time at the phone booth.<eos> If anybody asks you what you're doing, well, you're waiting for a call from your girlfriend.
Alberto?<eos> Alphonse?<eos> Augustine?<eos> Ambrose?<eos> It's entirely up to you.
Jimmy to my friends.<eos> I got a card, too.<eos> Okay.<eos> Let's get outta here.<eos> I'm gonna leave you with one question.
They all know what they are.<eos> Americans know who they are.<eos> They pretend they know.<eos> But it's still just pretending, like I'm pretending now.<eos> Just like you.
Roger, left.<eos> Targets incoming on my nine, high...<eos> Same old shit, "hurry up and wait,".<eos> Look, gunny, we... We got an intel flash. The hale was carrying 10 times our number.<eos> We weren't going to send you down to a slaughter.
God!<eos> God, I hate space.<eos> You're gonna want to hear this story.<eos> Now what story is that?<eos> Maybe it's the one about why the rock I sent you to. Exploded into a nuclear fireball?
God, I hate space.<eos> You're gonna want to hear this story.<eos> Now what story is that?<eos> Maybe it's the one about why the rock I sent you to. Exploded into a nuclear fireball?<eos> Or what happened to the opa operative I tasked you to find?
Slugging it out with a stealth is not gonna get it done.<eos> If you want to take that station, You need to land an assault team.<eos> Do you have any idea of the resistance inside?<eos> No, we don't.<eos> That's why we're talking to you.
That's why we're talking to you.<eos> You're the military genius.<eos> Well, I don't do that kind of thing anymore.<eos> And the opa is not an army...<eos> We're going, with or without you.
They're a friendly bunch, They'll have whatever you need.<eos> Union offices are about two levels down from here, And the tycho station admin, just past that.<eos> Y'all can apply for assistance. At either one of those, if you need.<eos> Now your lodgings are gonna be. Right around that corner, all right?<eos> But I can set you up and get you transport. If you want to go somewhere else, so don't be shy.
No.<eos> I'm scared shitless.<eos> Feeling guilty as hell.<eos> Please god, stop trying to take credit. For every damn thing that's wrong in the universe.<eos> I'm talking about all of you.
God damn it!<eos> I'll have... Gin and tonic with a lime.<eos> You're not as invisible as you think you are.<eos> I'm not on a covert op.<eos> I would've pegged you as a scotch drinker...
No ranks.<eos> Here, I'll get the ball rolling.<eos> I'm a smug old bitch, Who enjoys playing with life and death. On her big chessboard.<eos> A snake in a sari...<eos> With dead eyes and a poison tongue. And the solar system is in tatters. Because of people like you and errinwright.
Colonel johnson wasn't told that they'd surrendered.<eos> If he knew, he would have never. Called that strike in.<eos> Why wasn't he told?<eos> Because the powers that be. Wanted to send a message to the belt.<eos> "Defy us, we wipe you out." message sent.
Staz, split them up into four groups.<eos> Five of you guys come with me.<eos> Stay sharp.<eos> Everybody stay sharp and watch the doors and corners.<eos> Doors and corners are where they get you.
You okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Did we win?<eos> Rocinante, we're proceeding to hard dock.<eos> We'll see you in the station.
Idiots.<eos> Every scrap of data in this facility. Has been encrypted.<eos> We know what you were doing on eros.<eos> Nobody knows what we're doing on eros.<eos> And every minute I have to spend playing games with you, Takes me away from that work.
- It's a very alarming charge.<eos> - The Russians hacked our committees.<eos> The continuation of endless war.<eos> Can't you get that through your fucking skull?<eos> The revolution will put you in the driver's seat.
Hold on.<eos> Hey, you called me.<eos> I'm just having an honest reaction here.<eos> And no, it isn't business as usual.<eos> I'm gonna fight you on this.
He told them that Sekou was no threat.<eos> They practically had to shove the five grand down his throat, for Chrissake!<eos> I mean, surely, we can use that.<eos> How?<eos> By putting you on the stand?
I hope not.<eos> Otherwise, you should feel free to ask the Director for someone you're more comfortable with.<eos> You know what?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> I think I'll stick with you.
I wish.<eos> - Hey, Carrie.<eos> - Hi. Is Reda in yet?<eos> Haven't seen him.<eos> Some flowers came for you, though.
- You wanna finish your time?<eos> You know I don't.<eos> You gotta push him to meet Hafiz.<eos> I'm-<eos> - I'm telling you, he flat out refused.
- Mm.<eos> - He's 6 now.<eos> Looks like his father.<eos> He's always getting into trouble, so naturally, he's my favorite.<eos> Doesn't that bother you?
There's no bending with a fanatic.<eos> After you met him... you changed.<eos> Moshe opened my eyes to the false life that mother and father had us living-- exchanging Christmas presents with the neighbors, doing everything we could not to offend anyone with our Jewishness.<eos> Moshe made me proud to be a Jew.<eos> He turned you against your family.

This land was promised to Abraham.<eos> Ah, yes.<eos> Promise.<eos> A covenant with God made thousands of years ago.<eos> Doesn't that strike you as a form of insanity?
Just give me the keys.<eos> Baby, don't do this.<eos> - Please?<eos> - Which one is his?<eos> I can get you what you need, and we can have a good time.
Clarice ain't here.<eos> Oh, I'm not looking for Clarice.<eos> What then?<eos> Business.<eos> I saw a video of you on YouTube, gettin' gassed in the shower.
- Yeah, you lived it, I guess.<eos> You wanna sit?<eos> No, I'm good.<eos> Hey, man, if I knew who you was,<eos> I never would've knocked you out.
Fuckin' spaz.<eos> Fuck, man!<eos> Aah!<eos> So...<eos> That's the $2,000 I owe you.
Aah!<eos> So...<eos> That's the $2,000 I owe you.<eos> Less the $2,000 you stole from me, leaves what?<eos> How much I owe you now?
Ever since my father got deported.<eos> That money was a loan to help pay for that.<eos> From whom?<eos> Sekou? From whom?<eos> If I tell you who gave me the money...
You got all your friends here.<eos> You want to make an entrance.<eos> Fine.<eos> I'm impressed.<eos> That's not why I wanted to meet you here.
Ask him about his travels.<eos> Tell me this, Dar.<eos> Off the record, just you and me.<eos> Does that sound like a solid intelligence-gathering effort to you, or does that sound like a way to provoke a crisis with Iran we inherit on inauguration day?<eos> No one is trying to saddle you with anything, Rob.
Right there in front of him.<eos> Huggies.<eos> White wrapper.<eos> Right there.<eos> Right there, right in front of you.
- It's called free speech.<eos> - Not when you add in the money.<eos> Which you gave him for airline tickets.<eos> Airline tickets?<eos> Is that what he told you?
Unfortunately, that's not an option.<eos> Mossad can't be trusted to be even remotely objective on this, and the accusation is too serious to ignore.<eos> Well, what do you suggest?<eos> You recommend somebody absolutely trustworthy to represent US interests on the ground there.<eos> Like you, for example?
Like you, for example?<eos> No. God, no. Uh...<eos> No, I was thinking...<eos> Saul Berenson. But you said he visited you today.<eos> Yeah. To see if I was advising you.
You're not the bad guy here. We know that, too.<eos> You were pressured by the FBI, by Agent Conlin.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Did he say that no one would ever know?<eos> 'Cause if he did, he lied to you, and if he lied to you, you're on the wrong side.
Look, Pittsburgh was different.<eos> Those were drug dealers.<eos> Those were murderers. They got what they deserved.<eos> But not Sekou.<eos> Right. I told you.
Those were drug dealers.<eos> Those were murderers. They got what they deserved.<eos> But not Sekou.<eos> Right. I told you.<eos> - I told you.
You don't know what that's like.<eos> You don't know anything.<eos> Was it in Pittsburgh when you met Conlin?<eos> Just keeps going.<eos> I already told you I don't know who this is...
We have no comment at this time.<eos> Sekou, what were the terms of your release?<eos> What do you say to your social media profile?<eos> Did you provide names of other radicals?<eos> Sekou, is it true your father radicalized you?
Mr. Hashem, you haven't eaten a thing.<eos> Here. Don't mind if I do.<eos> So Simone told me you got me my job back.<eos> - That's awesome. Thank you.<eos> Well, your boss is expecting you tomorrow morning, bright and early.
Who are you?<eos> Wrong address. I'm delivering it.<eos> - Where do you live?<eos> - Across the...<eos> I see you in here again, I call the police.
Then stop the bad advice.<eos> How can you be so sure. Iran's not building a bomb in North Korea?<eos> I can't, but neither can you be so sure they are.<eos> And that's the point, isn't it?<eos> I came to you as a friend, Carrie, an admirer even, and I'm telling you this in the same spirit...
Talked, mostly.<eos> Lot of catching up to do.<eos> I bet. Must have been up late.<eos> - Till 3:00, 3:30.<eos> - Just the two of you, was it?
Find out about Nafisi.<eos> Get me the real answer.<eos> His name is Saad Mahsud.<eos> He's working for the FBI.<eos> I'm telling you, he flat out refused.
They took him straight to Bellevue.<eos> -The psych ward?<eos> -That's all I know.<eos> Well, thanks for wasting my time.<eos> Hey, I didn't tell you to come here.
-I'm thinking it's safe.<eos> -I understand your frustration, but the concern here is continuity of government.<eos> Really?<eos> You really think that's what's going on?<eos> It doesn't strike you as extreme, my sequestration here?
-Conlin, wait.<eos> -That, I promise.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I said, "Wait."<eos> Doesn't seem wrong to you, being here?
-That, I promise.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I said, "Wait."<eos> Doesn't seem wrong to you, being here?<eos> I've been trying to reach you.
I've been trying to reach you.<eos> Did you get the photos I sent?<eos> Maybe.<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's great seeing you.
-If I have to.<eos> I'll get right on it then.<eos> Again, my apologies.<eos> Mercedes.<eos> Nice meeting you.
Relax.<eos> There.<eos> I wouldn't be asking if I didn't absolutely have to know.<eos> You're right, sir.<eos> The chief was not... totally forthcoming with you.
You got a minute?<eos> Sure.<eos> Do you... do you want sit up there and read your book?<eos> Okay?<eos> I never expected to see you at my door.
Mommy, it's cold!<eos> Yeah, I'm coming, sweetie.<eos> I called in a favor with NYPD.<eos> A guy on the task force named Danny Jones.<eos> He can get you into the prison ward at Bellevue tomorrow to see Quinn.
I'm afraid not, ma'am.<eos> I'm done here.<eos> Thanks, guys.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Can I help you, ma'am?
I can't wait to get into the private sector.<eos> All that data they wouldn't let us touch.<eos> Can you believe the numbers they're throwing around here?<eos> I know.<eos> They say anything strange to you?
A private one, and you're trespassing.<eos> What's your position here?<eos> Could I have your name?<eos> You wouldn't have lied your way in if you had any legal authority, like a warrant.<eos> The guards will escort you out.
Maybe you're not much use to me after all.<eos> Mr. Emmons, sorry for the confusion.<eos> Yeah, well, someone better streamline that shit before we get to the White House.<eos> Absolutely, sir.<eos> I'll take you to the president-elect.
I'll take you to the president-elect.<eos> She's been working all afternoon.<eos> -If she's busy, I can wait.<eos> -No.<eos> Trust me... She wants to see you.
I didn't.<eos> And I'm good with faces.<eos> You look so familiar.<eos> You didn't volunteer for the Hudson Valley Committee back in 2000?<eos> I can tell you for sure that I didn't.
And I'm good with faces.<eos> You look so familiar.<eos> You didn't volunteer for the Hudson Valley Committee back in 2000?<eos> I can tell you for sure that I didn't.<eos> I've never voted for you.
I'm just curious why you agreed to do this.<eos> Because you're the president-elect, you asked me, and I know it's right.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I appreciate that.<eos> I hope I can win you over.
I'd at least like to know why you couldn't support me.<eos> -It doesn't matter.<eos> -Well, it matters to me.<eos> How many times in your life are you gonna be alone with the next President of the United States?<eos> I guess I don't trust you.
-Agent Thoms?<eos> -Ma'am, are you safe?<eos> If you're asking if this was my idea, the answer is "yes."<eos> Then please ask Mrs. Diehl to pull over.<eos> We have a vehicle on the way that will return you to the compound.
I'm not going back.<eos> Under Chapter 18, United States Code 3056, it is illegal for you to deny protection, ma'am.<eos> I am not denying protection.<eos> You are free to escort me back to New York.<eos> Neither Mrs. Diehl nor her vehicle are equipped to transport you safely.
No.<eos> I really should get going.<eos> You've given me a lot to think about.<eos> Not the easiest conversation I've ever had.<eos> I think they're waiting for you.
No, I can't.<eos> But I want to thank the dedicated people who looked after my safety and the safety of this great city.<eos> There are some reports suggesting that you yourself were the target of the attack.<eos> Well, I'd rather wait for the results of the investigation before commenting on that.<eos> The president is urging you and Congress to reauthorize certain provisions of the PATRIOT Act.
We had a very interesting talk.<eos> -About what?<eos> -Our sons.<eos> Madam President, can you speak up?<eos> We can't hear you back here.
Pretty much had to come from NSA.<eos> Unless the CIA has some monitoring program I don't know about.<eos> Answer me!<eos> Where did it come from?<eos> I told you, I can't say!
Where did it come from?<eos> I told you, I can't say!<eos> Imagine that hundreds of people are dead in Manhattan right now.<eos> And then ask yourself why you're still wasting time fucking with me.<eos> I'm not fucking with you.
I'm so important I have no phone.<eos> It's to safeguard your physical location, ma'am.<eos> I'll let you know the second a secure line is available.<eos> Oh, this is Marjorie Diehl.<eos> - She'll be assisting you.
It won't be long.<eos> Nothing for now, thanks.<eos> Right out front, sir.<eos> What did I say last time?<eos> I can't be seen with you.
It's about the bomb.<eos> When we met before--<eos> - Met?<eos> - Fine.<eos> I ambushed you so you could get me the recording of a conversation between an informant and his FBI handler.
You can speak with specific people in the White House, including the president.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It's a start.<eos> Please.<eos> I'd like to bring you up to speed on the attack and a few unfortunate facts you should be aware of.
But this was a man who hated the US government.<eos> You are the premiere symbol of that government in New York at the moment.<eos> And with the possibility of accomplices out there, I'm asking that we err on the side of caution.<eos> That's all, then.<eos> Is there anything I can get for you?
That's what I've told everybody here.<eos> I shouldn't have left you alone here with her.<eos> And I'm so sorry.<eos> But I--<eos> I had such a good feeling, seeing the two of you together.
Hey, sweetie.<eos> Can you wake up to get to the car?<eos> Sweetie?<eos> She's had a long day.<eos> You sure it's okay, us staying with you?
Now, this woman has been telling us since she hit the campaign trail two years ago--<eos> "Don't over-react," and here she is, not even following her own advice.<eos> And what I'm wondering-- would you fight for her, General?<eos> I fight for my country.<eos> Well, I am with you there.
We talked about going home.<eos> She was good with it.<eos> It's not safe psychologically for her to be there.<eos> Look, I d...<eos> I don't agree with you, but I-I can take her somewhere for a few days, to a hotel if you think that's best.
Gentlemen, I have your passports.<eos> Mr. Alibadi.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Mr. Kasem.<eos> That's for you.
Thank you.<eos> - Mr. Falhadi.<eos> - Right here.<eos> And, finally, Mr. Mohada.<eos> My colleague will escort you to your cars.
I know who you are.<eos> What's this about?<eos> We have a bit of an issue.<eos> I'm listening.<eos> The Director's asked me to debrief you on your recent visit to the West Bank.
Tell me about him.<eos> What's your connection?<eos> We're former colleagues.<eos> We worked together at the Central Intelligence Agency.<eos> Why is he living with you?
He believed that Franny was in danger, which, you know, she was, sh... from people throwing rocks, from the police.<eos> He was doing what he could to keep her safe.<eos> Do you think that Franny felt safe?<eos> W... I'm sure she was frightened, but she's a strong girl.<eos> There's something I want to share with you.
Who are you?<eos> Amir.<eos> You and I have a friend in common.<eos> Where is our friend?<eos> Someplace safe, waiting for you.
Where is our friend?<eos> Someplace safe, waiting for you.<eos> Why didn't he come?<eos> He'll explain when you see him.<eos> Come, I'll take you to him.
Dar Adal...<eos> I told him about it myself.<eos> The same Dar Adal who's been trying to undermine the nuclear deal every step of the way?<eos> That was over three years ago.<eos> If he was gonna burn you... time was then, not now.
Your friend the banker, Farhad Nafisi.<eos> He's a little hard to recognize, I admit.<eos> Wild guess...<eos> He's working for Mossad. For the past eight years.<eos> Including the little show they put on for you in Abu Dhabi.
Plus, I want 'round-the-clock protection and access to my $45 million.<eos> That's gonna be a little trickier.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> I'm listening.<eos> I can put you in front of someone who can make it happen.
Help me put him in the trunk.<eos> Where is he?<eos> Down by the lake.<eos> He hasn't said a word...<eos> not since I called you.
I-I...<eos> What...<eos> What am I supposed to do?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But I can't help you.
It's Christine Lonas from ACS.<eos> I just wanted to let you know that Franny's in foster care.<eos> She'll stay there for the foreseeable future.<eos> I don't enjoy taking a child from her mother, but in this case, it's clearly the right thing to do.<eos> That's why I contacted you.
The deal is broken.<eos> We are pursuing a parallel program in North Korea.<eos> He told me exactly the opposite last night.<eos> Madame President-Elect.<eos> Madame President-Elect, I have to speak to you.
Madame President-Elect.<eos> Madame President-Elect, I have to speak to you.<eos> Javadi is lying. It's the only explanation.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> I can think of others, including one where you were wrong and I was wrong to have ever listened to you.
Maybe I was afraid she would remind me of that.<eos> And did she?<eos> Well, her father had red hair, and-- and she has red hair, so at first, whenever I looked, what I'd see...<eos> What I'd see was that he wasn't there.<eos> She reminded you of his absence.
They said it couldn't be done.<eos> The President-Elect could not be moved.<eos> That's what they said.<eos> But she has been, finally.<eos> And I owe it all to you.
Thisiswrong.<eos> Idon'tdisagree.<eos> I can't.<eos> It's not up to me.<eos> I still have value to you, intelligence.
I've been recalled to Langley. - Saul.<eos> Order of the President-Elect her fucking self.<eos> Hold on, wait.<eos> Listen to what? - Shh!<eos> If it makes any difference, some said ship you back to Tehran. I told them that was just cruel.
We need to locate this call.<eos> - Yeah, of course.<eos> I take no pleasure in this. No.<eos> - Hurry.<eos> I should have never trusted you!
I mean, who even thinks like this?<eos> Ma'am, there's something else we should get out into the open, just so we're all clear.<eos> What, more good news?<eos> The bombing.<eos> There's a man who set up a surveillance operation on me, probably to document my interactions with you.
I don't want us to be done. I think you'd be good here.<eos> But you know the drill-- Blank spaces make people nervous.<eos> You've got to give me something.<eos> It's private.<eos> What do we know, you and I? No such thing as private anymore, is there?
It's private.<eos> What do we know, you and I? No such thing as private anymore, is there?<eos> M and M?<eos> That year, from here to here, I spent smoking meth and masturbating.<eos> What sent you into this tailspin? Can you tell me that?
He took it upon himself to travel off-book to the occupied territories to meet with an asset he placed years ago.<eos> That's the only reason any of us is here. It's the only reason we're not just being steamrolled by Dar and his fucking cabal.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Carrie, I'm the newcomer here, but I'm already certain.<eos> An affidavit from you about what happened in Berlin, that's how we get Dar.
Dar's here.<eos> He's in the building.<eos> Not too late to cancel.<eos> The meeting's been scheduled.<eos> I can sub in for you. No. No changes.
You said you had some names for me.<eos> That's him, isn't it?<eos> Your son, Andrew.<eos> Yes.<eos> I can't help but think how proud he'd be of you right now.
I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> You stay.<eos> I would never hurt you, Peter. You know that.<eos> I don't.<eos> I got you out of lockup.
Listen to me. We can figure this out.<eos> - No!<eos> Together, like we always have.<eos> Where is he?<eos> - I raised you, Peter.
- I raised you, Peter.<eos> Stay there.<eos> - You are my child.<eos> More than that.<eos> I would never hurt you.
- You are my child.<eos> More than that.<eos> I would never hurt you.<eos> Never.<eos> I love you.
Three candidates I would never consider for any position at any time.<eos> I'm sorry you feel that way.<eos> You can't really have expected anything different.<eos> Actually, I did.<eos> And I'd ask you to reconsider-- advise you to.
Do I give up, roll over?<eos> Do you see me resigning?<eos> I am the next president of the United States.<eos> Sixty million people voted for me.<eos> Who the hell voted for you?
Are you threatening me now?<eos> I'm telling you it's a war you won't win.<eos> Two hundred and fifty years of movement toward the light in this country, towards justice...<eos> Say what you want, call me naive, but I believe in that light.<eos> And I will not be held hostage by you or anybody else.
Next time, you ask for half up front.<eos> No, you don't!<eos> You f-- You fucking assholes.<eos> About fucking time.<eos> Assholes-- all of you.
Hello?<eos> Carrie, hi.<eos> It's Christine Lonas.<eos> Did you hear from the doctor?<eos> I did, and let me just apologize right off the bat for worrying you unnecessarily.
- I see.<eos> My supervisor took the call early this morning.<eos> It was an honest mistake.<eos> I see.<eos> Anyway, the good news is we can keep our appointmet as scheduled if that's still good for you.
You want to know why I didn't go through with it.<eos> Yes, though, honestly, I might have some idea.<eos> My priorities shifted.<eos> Really?<eos> Well, let me tell you what happened to me today just about the same time your priorities were shifting.
Then don't ask me questions you know I can't answer.<eos> And don't show up here with a platoon of armed men and tell yourself you're not trying to strong-arm me, too.<eos> - Now, I was just leaving.<eos> - So that's it.<eos> This is all fine with you.
- Carrie!<eos> I can't.<eos> Mrs. Berenson?<eos> That's right.<eos> A man left this message for you.
There was an incident with the President-elect.<eos> Some demonstrators got out of hand, but she's okay.<eos> We got reinforcements on the way.<eos> What do you mean "reinforcements"?<eos> Carrie, I got to call you back.
Considering how many times you've had me up to the Hill to testify about enhanced interrogation techniques.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Have you lost your fucking mind?<eos> I'm a United States Senator!<eos> And I'll tell you now as I told you then...
A team of Deltas is providing an additional layer of security.<eos> Wait a minute. Are those the reinforcements you were talking about?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why?<eos> Listen. I'm gonna call you back when I know more.
- Right behind them.<eos> What about the rest of my staff?<eos> They're coming down the east stairwell, ma'am, and evacuating through the back entrance.<eos> I can't leave without them.<eos> Ma'am, my orders are to put you in this vehicle.
- Quinn?<eos> - This isn't Quinn, Carrie.<eos> Dar?<eos> What do you mean they're evacuating the hotel?<eos> - Fuck you, Dar!
We're on the move.<eos> You go ahead. I'm gonna ride with Keane.<eos> You sure?<eos> - What about Quinn? - Is he there, too...<eos> With you now?
- Who is?<eos> The same people that detonated that bomb and just executed Agent Thoms.<eos> Listen to me, Elizabeth. We're in a kill zone now.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> They missed you once, now they have to finish the job... which means either we stay here and pray they don't find us or...
_<eos> Okay, Brett, you're on in three, two... one.<eos> Today, I don't even feel worthy of being here.<eos> Today, my soul is in crisis.<eos> I have failed you, and I have failed myself.
Well, maybe I don't like the idea of you worrying about me anymore.<eos> You can go right in.<eos> - Carrie.<eos> - Madam President.<eos> David and I were just speaking about you.
You haven't missed much.<eos> How are you?<eos> Every day, the same bloody questions over and over as if I'm withholding names, as if there were hundreds of us.<eos> Really, what can you do with asses like that?<eos> I wish you had given me a chance to talk you out of it.
I know.<eos> There's something dogmatic and dangerous, something distinctly un-American.<eos> Anyway.<eos> Another lesson learned... in a long life of lessons.<eos> Tell me, is there anything I can do for you?
Right away.<eos> Really?<eos> Great.<eos> Well, I guess that's it.<eos> Here. I'll show you out.
Same meeting.<eos> Have him call me back as soon as he gets out.<eos> I will.<eos> So don't be upset. - Don't be upset?<eos> I've been trying to reach you all afternoon.
Slow down, ma'am.<eos> - Where are you going? - To see the President.<eos> Ronald, I need to see the President.<eos> - She's not available. - It's urgent.<eos> Ma'am, we've been ordered to escort you out of the building. - Ordered?
By who?<eos> - Mr. Wellington.<eos> Does the President know?<eos> Madam President?<eos> Madam President, I need to talk to you. It's important.
'Cause they were coming for me.<eos> Who is?<eos> The people who built the bomb.<eos> You were in a coma, Peter.<eos> Carrie ordered the doctors to wake you up.
You should have come to me.<eos> Honestly, Saul, I... I didn't know whose side you were on.<eos> Five's the limit, pal.<eos> - Ooh. Sorry.<eos> I see you in here again, I call the police.
He told me exactly the opposite last night.<eos> Let him finish.<eos> Thank you, Madam.<eos> Saul is right.<eos> I did tell him differently last night, but only because I knew I wouldn't get this audience with you if I told him the truth.
Big Apple's coming down.<eos> Vehicle, stand by.<eos> What the fuck? !<eos> Madam President-elect.<eos> Madam President-elect, I have to speak to you.
What's this?<eos> A work in progress.<eos> It's not ready yet.<eos> I am the next president of the United States.<eos> Who the hell voted for you?
He was running toward a fallen comrade to save that man's life.<eos> That act, which was attested to by six soldiers who were actually there... That act cost my son his life... and won him the Silver Star.<eos> Whoever made the video is not only trying to undo that and damage him personally, but to damage my presidency.<eos> I call on the actual cowards, the people who made it, to come out of the shadows and show their faces.<eos> Madam President-Elect, are you calling this a conspiracy against you?
He has concerns.<eos> I'm dealing with it.<eos> You should have told me.<eos> What's he doing here?<eos> He has something important to talk to you about.
Fine.<eos> So you know who she is?<eos> Yeah.<eos> So?<eos> - Did she tell you to get a job here?
Yeah.<eos> So?<eos> - Did she tell you to get a job here?<eos> - No.<eos> - Did she tell you to take that video of me?
So, we just let them keep screaming at us without a response?<eos> Here's a response...<eos> The man is insane.<eos> Saul.<eos> We wouldn't be aware of any of this if it weren't for you.
It's happening right now in front of your faces.<eos> We have O'Keefe.<eos> We have a disinformation campaign designed to discredit the president-elect.<eos> And as of today, we have boots on the ground... like the protesters I had to wade through to get here.<eos> That seem familiar to any of you?
Really, ma'am, you're safe here.<eos> Why don't we start?<eos> Let him go.<eos> Let him go.<eos> We have a friend in common, you and I.
He's developed quite an online presence recently...<eos> A website... which worries me.<eos> You want to know why?<eos> This is getting tiring, Max.<eos> If I wanted to hurt you, you'd be hurt by now.
Special because my guest is the next president of the United States,<eos> Elizabeth Keane.<eos> Welcome, Madam President-Elect.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So, let me ask you what everyone is asking right now... Why are you here?
It's not true.<eos> Not true.<eos> Have you seen it?<eos> I have... more than a dozen times.<eos> Perhaps I can remind you.
Cowardice runs in the family.<eos> As I said, I have seen it.<eos> And I have to ask, why would you want to make a mother...<eos> Any mother... watch the last moments of her son's life?<eos> I know it must be painful for you and I-I'm sorry.
Yes.<eos> Run out of this studio.<eos> You didn't just produce the lying video.<eos> You faked the hate and the lies that accompanied it.<eos> People hate you, Madam President-Elect.
Things got a little crazy.<eos> I guess so.<eos> He was choking me out.<eos> Quinn saved my life.<eos> It never occurred to either of you this guy could have been a major witness?
For a moment there, I thought I might have changed some minds.<eos> You did.<eos> Just don't expect to change his.<eos> Whatever happened to government of the people, by the people, for the people?<eos> I'll tell you what happened.
Yes.<eos> That and because I know how protective you are of the Agency.<eos> Whatever is going on here, it's not the Agency.<eos> Not mine, anyway.<eos> Well, they're out in the open now, thanks to you.
He's around here somewhere.<eos> Hello?<eos> Rob Emmons.<eos> Rob, it's Carrie.<eos> I can barely hear you.
No!<eos> Wait!<eos> Aah!<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm with you.
Look at me.<eos> I don't believe in luck.<eos> Okay?<eos> Okay, Grace, we're here.<eos> We're gonna lower you down, all right?
Everything is going to be okay.<eos> Come on, let's go!<eos> There's no time.<eos> You're gonna be all right, okay?<eos> We've got you.
You're gonna be all right, okay?<eos> We've got you.<eos> Mag.<eos> That was quick.<eos> We were right behind you.
If things don't go well in that surgery, there will be time for that.<eos> But right now I'm gonna go in that room, and I'm gonna save your daughter's life.<eos> So your implant is hidden in the gluteal crust.<eos> Sounds like something you get at Pizza Hut.<eos> Which means, unfortunately, until the swelling goes down, we're not able to operate on you, Dustin, so...
The bleed must be bigger than we thought.<eos> We need to get him to the O.R. now.<eos> - You wait.<eos> - No, I can't, Charlie.<eos> We don't get you to the O.R. now, you may lose that arm.
More, more.<eos> I, uh, probably don't want to see this.<eos> Yeah, me neither.<eos> There. Nice tux.<eos> Yeah. Guess I could say the same thing for you.
Like you're at the end of a long wedding night.<eos> Well, that's funny.<eos> I actually proposed tonight.<eos> It's to my doctor, isn't it?<eos> I saw you two at the dinner.
I have to.<eos> If the next few hours are critical,<eos> I shouldn't be here.<eos> Yes, you should.<eos> Grace needs you.
Thank you.<eos> _<eos> Forgive me, Lord.<eos> Please, Lord.<eos> May the gods protect you on your quest.
It's ours, it must remain ours.<eos> I will ensure it.<eos> You have enough men, keep them sober and do not kill for the fun of it.<eos> No, Lord.<eos> You do me a great honour, Lord, though I wish I was going with you.
Fight the Dane!<eos> Test your sword-craft!<eos> Do battle with a turd, directly from the devil's arse!<eos> You can cut him, but you cannot kill him!<eos> And if he kills you, then so be it!
Test your sword-craft!<eos> Do battle with a turd, directly from the devil's arse!<eos> You can cut him, but you cannot kill him!<eos> And if he kills you, then so be it!<eos> More fool you!
Attack...<eos> Attack!<eos> No man shall move, or Sven Kjartanson will die!<eos> You will all hear me!<eos> All of you must leave this place.
Guthred!<eos> We are looking for Guthred of Cumbraland,<eos> - son of Harthacnut.<eos> - I am Guthred.<eos> - How can I help you?
- I am Guthred.<eos> - How can I help you?<eos> - Lord...<eos> Is it you?<eos> We have found you.
Then let him be the king.<eos> King for the day.<eos> - Thank you, King!<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Thank you and may God bless you all.
Beocca, they love me!<eos> Because they have no idea what a fool you are!<eos> Be careful, priest, or he will have your head.<eos> Not before he feels my boot!<eos> And may I present to you Queen Hild of the water bucket, scourge of slavers and once thrown out of the nunnery!
Lord King!<eos> Lord King, I am the abbot Eadred.<eos> Abbot, no...<eos> It is I to whom the blessed Saint Cuthbert appeared in a dream, a glorious dream.<eos> - Abbot, please... - He showed me your face... and he called you King.
I've never seen anything like it.<eos> Except when you did it for Mary.<eos> I get it, Matt.<eos> She left.<eos> My heart breaks for both of you, but you making up this bullshit story about some nutjob departing--
Try not to walk on too much water when I'm gone, okay? - I won't.<eos> And I love you, too.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> May I help you, ma'am?
- I can tell you what I paid--<eos> - Mark. - Yeah?<eos> - I don't know if you are a part of this or a victim of it, but if this is real, if they've actually built this device, they're not sending people to some magical place<eos> They're incinerating them.<eos> They will call you on this with a formal invitation and instructions.
Hello.<eos> Miss Durst?<eos> Yes.<eos> Thank you for answering the call.<eos> Mark explained the opportunity we're offering you?
Yes.<eos> Thank you for answering the call.<eos> Mark explained the opportunity we're offering you?<eos> Yes.<eos> Someone is standing by to meet you at the Crown Central in Melbourne, Australia.
But I can tell you the return address.<eos> One Matthew Jamison.<eos> Miracle, Texas.<eos> US of A.<eos> If that's not enough, I can tell you what's inside.
Actually, I painted it myself.<eos> - You did not.<eos> - I did.<eos> Well, then you are incredibly talented.<eos> So, what brings you here, Frank?
No, no, no. Documentaries are boring.<eos> I'm just seeking enlightenment.<eos> I'm only interested in his wisdom, his counsel,<eos> - nothing else.<eos> - I'd have to accompany you.
I'm only interested in his wisdom, his counsel,<eos> - nothing else.<eos> - I'd have to accompany you.<eos> I wouldn't want it any other way.<eos> Let me see if I can get that address for you.
- It seems that, um, Chris lives in a... _ - community just a few...<eos> I'd like you to hear my side.<eos> "Appropriation of sacred ceremonies without permission," "theft of creation songs," "misrepresentation of identity.<eos> Under no circumstances" "should this man be given access to tribal elders."<eos> Shame on you.
Really?<eos> I've stolen?<eos> Same way your government stole a whole generation of their children?<eos> We apologized for that!<eos> Shame on you, Sharon.
Christopher Sunday.<eos> I'm sorry if I mispronounced.<eos> Are you Christopher Sunday?<eos> Chris.<eos> Chris, it's a real honor to meet you.
Are you Christopher Sunday?<eos> Chris.<eos> Chris, it's a real honor to meet you.<eos> I am Kevin, Totem of the Bush Snake.<eos> I've come a long way to find you.
Don't believe a word that woman says about me.<eos> Remember, we've got a deal!<eos> I rolled the other way.<eos> You saw me, right?<eos> I... I tried to miss you.
I never even considered searching for them.<eos> If I had...<eos> I took the cross from the chapel and brought it out there...<eos> To mark the place where they died.<eos> The place where I found you.
I'll be in and out, I swear.<eos> I really need this job.<eos> Please.<eos> - Um... - I'm begging you.<eos> - Okay. - God bless you!
I saw you on my TV.<eos> You were looking right fucking at me.<eos> Everything right?<eos> Yeah. I'm fine.<eos> Is he bothering you, miss?
I am so sorry. I did not hear you come in.<eos> I'm Dr. Eden.<eos> And that is Dr. Bekker.<eos> Hi.<eos> Thank you for coming all this way.
But Bernard is very professional. I promise you're in good hands.<eos> Great!<eos> Well, we will see you in a bit.<eos> She was ready to go.<eos> She was ready to go and she wishes she could've told you.
Great!<eos> Well, we will see you in a bit.<eos> She was ready to go.<eos> She was ready to go and she wishes she could've told you.<eos> She was ready to go and she wishes she could've told you, but she just couldn't.
Sir, did your sister disappear on October 14th?<eos> Why?<eos> I'm so sorry, but I can't make a connection with those who departed.<eos> They're in a different space, man.<eos> Wish I could help you out, but... I can't. I'm sorry.
Daniah or Daneeah.<eos> - "Danyah"?<eos> - "Danyah," yes.<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> Is there something I can do for you, sir?
Then why are you still using that accent?<eos> - I have to go.<eos> What the fuck is going on?<eos> What?<eos> I have compassion for you because you are ill.
What the fuck is going on?<eos> What?<eos> I have compassion for you because you are ill.<eos> I wanted to help.<eos> She told me to tell you that I was who you thought I was and then you'd go away.
It's very even.<eos> Most people panic after a few minutes.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Let's have a chat, shall we?<eos> Mr. Linn-Baker enjoyed talking to you in St. Louis.
No, it's not here.<eos> I'm happy to answer any other questions you may have about the device, technical or otherwise.<eos> Why haven't you used it?<eos> Everything I need is here.<eos> What about you?
- Are they mine, the twins?<eos> - Irrelevant.<eos> It's relevant if you want me to answer your fucking question.<eos> They're not yours.<eos> She was working for you.
You turn me down and then you want me to beg you to take my money, right?<eos> Keep your money.<eos> Wait!<eos> Stop!<eos> Go home, Miss Durst. This isn't for you.
Reverend.<eos> I brought a casserole.<eos> ...islands in the Pacific. And early reports confirm it was uninhabited.<eos> The French government is denying any responsibility, and details surrounding...<eos> - God bless you, Reverend. - Thank you.
Arturo, I need you to fly me to Australia.<eos> What?<eos> A cargo plane with the donated food for El Salvador is sitting on the tarmac in Austin, fueled up and ready to go.<eos> I need to get to Melbourne immediately.<eos> I'm asking you to fly me there.
And you, Arturo, are not only a valued member of our congregation, but licensed by an internationally recognized NGO.<eos> Randy's available to copilot.<eos> Reverend, I-- I can't leave my mother.<eos> That's $20,000.<eos> It should be more than enough to compensate you for your time and get excellent care for your mother.
They bought the boat, sir.<eos> If you wanna get on, I'm afraid you're gonna have to take it up with them.<eos> Are they putting a lion on that boat?<eos> Sure looks like it.<eos> Hi. Nice to see you girls.
Are they putting a lion on that boat?<eos> Sure looks like it.<eos> Hi. Nice to see you girls.<eos> Come in, come in.<eos> I know I marked you off.
I'm appealing to your sense of charity to let us onboard.<eos> There's gonna be sex on this boat.<eos> There's gonna be a lot of it.<eos> Debased and sinful from port to port, all without judgment.<eos> Is that gonna be all right for you?
A pimple waits until you're 12 to come on your face.<eos> Righty-o, then.<eos> The lady has free reign.<eos> No law can govern the lioness.<eos> And as for you fellas, there's only one rule, so learn it well.
- Matt.<eos> You're bleeding.<eos> It's fine.<eos> I'm fine. It's fine.<eos> He hit you, huh?
Red hat and a beard. Likes the top deck.<eos> But I'd steer clear if I were you.<eos> Excuse me, sir.<eos> Sir.<eos> I'm sorry to bother you, but are you telling people you're God?
Well, we'll be at the bar.<eos> If you can't find us, just look for the orgy.<eos> God speed.<eos> Man overboard!<eos> I saw you.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.<eos> I know what you did.<eos> You think you can get away with this?<eos> Don't ignore me!<eos> I'm talking to you.
Actually, Laurie... I'm dying.<eos> What?<eos> David Burton, you are under arrest!<eos> Out of the way! Out of the way! - All of you!<eos> That's the guy I was telling you about.
I take it your husband told you we were here.<eos> Which husband?<eos> I heard you were with the good Reverend Jamison.<eos> He coming, too?<eos> He gave me something for you, though.
Which husband?<eos> I heard you were with the good Reverend Jamison.<eos> He coming, too?<eos> He gave me something for you, though.<eos> He says he's sorry he didn't put you in his fucking book.
It was a horrible mistake, and I will be taking responsibility for what I've done.<eos> I'm not sure she understands.<eos> I understand.<eos> You want to drown Kevin so that he can go to this place where the dead people are.<eos> And while he's there, he's going to learn a song from one of the dead people and he's gonna bring that song back to you so you can sing it and stop the biblical flood that's gonna happen tomorrow.
Why wouldn't she be?<eos> Well, so everybody wants something.<eos> A brain, a heart, courage.<eos> Kevin's in the Emerald City.<eos> He's the one that's gonna give it to you.
The fuck are these?<eos> Uh, my sunglasses.<eos> No reflective surfaces.<eos> Do not look into them no matter what.<eos> That's how they found you.
The Prime Minister of Australia?<eos> Man, you want that kind of high-level access, you're gonna have to talk to the boss yourself.<eos> Here. Stick that in your ear.<eos> You'll hear him, he'll hear you.<eos> He'll talk you through this whole shit show.
G'day... g'day, Melbourne.<eos> Thank you for the warm welcome.<eos> This isn't my first time visiting the other side of the world.<eos> Every time I'm here, it gets harder and harder to leave.<eos> Uh... I've come to talk to you today about marriage.
♪ Some sweet-talking girl comes along... ♪<eos> ♪ Singing her song ♪<eos> - ♪ Don't mess around... ♪<eos> - Sir, we have a situation.<eos> We need to move you now.
We need to move you now.<eos> No, wait. I, uh...<eos> I have to... I have to talk to that girl.<eos> No, we haven't got time for that, sir.<eos> We need to get you to a secure location.
- Mr. President, it appears Ukrainian separatists have taken control of an armed nuclear submarine, and they'll have launch capability within two hours.<eos> You're being brought to a bunker, which you will access with your unique biometrics once inside.<eos> - Sorry, my unique biometrics?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> The door can only be unlocked by you and you alone unless you have an identical twin brother, which would be ridiculous.
Name of your Secretary of Defense?<eos> Sir, I need a name.<eos> Patti Levin.<eos> Correct.<eos> Good to see you, Mr. President.
- I don't have...<eos> - You don't have any what?<eos> You don't have any balls?<eos> What?<eos> Sorry to interrupt, Mr. President, but the vice president is here and she's demanding to speak to you.
It's in lockdown, but the code is 6969.<eos> And please make sure you fucking kill the Secretary of Defense.<eos> - Where's the comms room?<eos> - What? The comms room. I need to make a call.<eos> Do you know what's inside of you?
- What? The comms room. I need to make a call.<eos> Do you know what's inside of you?<eos> Yes. Then you know that the president will not hesitate to cut you open and pull it out.<eos> I mean, I know this man. He is cold and he is merciless.<eos> You think he gives a shit about you if he's willing to end the world?
- Sir, this is my post.<eos> Give us the fucking room.<eos> Hello. Are you Christopher Sunday?<eos> My name is Kevin, and I know this is gonna sound crazy... but you're not the Prime Minister of Australia.<eos> My father, he came to you for a song.
Nothing, it...<eos> It's fine. What did she say?<eos> She wants you to do it again.<eos> Why do you want me to do it again?<eos> Because I do not believe you.
Excuse me, but you're lying.<eos> You're just...<eos> You're just saying what we want to hear.<eos> You invited me here, and then you rejected me.<eos> But I sat outside your house all night and I followed you here, so you'd have no choice but to let me get into your machine.
Step inside the event chamber, close the exit port behind you, and turn the latch to the left. Hard to the left.<eos> It'll stick. Then pull your knees towards your chest and hold them there.<eos> - Okay?<eos> - Okay.<eos> We will be monitoring you from inside there.
I was worried you'd forgotten.<eos> Don't usually get so many so close together.<eos> Love is in the air.<eos> A little extra for your trouble.<eos> Sarah, does the name Kevin mean anything to you?
Sarah, does the name Kevin mean anything to you?<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Because a man calling himself that came by yesterday.<eos> He had a photo.<eos> A photo of you.
All right, everyone, settle down.<eos> I'm talking now!<eos> Listen up, fuckwits!<eos> All right, dearest family, beloved friends, and Russell.<eos> Eddie and I just wanna thank you all for being here on our special day to drink our alcohol free of charge.
Hi, hi.<eos> I brought photocopies of a dead bird.<eos> I got to break up with him.<eos> It's getting too dangerous.<eos> 'Cause he's trying to kill you?
Why do we even have to go through this?<eos> There's no way that marriage was legal.<eos> And now, in the name of me,<eos> Gosh Almighty, who you may know from, I don't know, Italian ceilings?<eos> I pronounce you Superman and wife!
But then he was gone, gone forever!<eos> Did you just get these today?<eos> You're not signing this.<eos> But the sticker says "Sign here." It's shaped like an arrow.<eos> Kimmy, this man put you through hell... cheating on you or whatever.
But the sticker says "Sign here." It's shaped like an arrow.<eos> Kimmy, this man put you through hell... cheating on you or whatever.<eos> -He kidnapped me.<eos> -I said, "Or whatever."<eos> But now he wants something from you, right?
I've been there.<eos> You fall asleep, dream you're French-kissing Ryan Seacrest, then you wake up, and it's two rats fighting over a hard-boiled egg in your mouth.<eos> No. I broke up with Bobby.<eos> And it was worse than I could have imagined.<eos> No. He killed you, and now you're a ghost?
- And you'll get it.<eos> Sometimes you have to do something really hard, like cleaning your room or finishing your homework, before you get what you really want.<eos> I'm glad you're my new neighbor.<eos> I thought that was great, man.<eos> How about you, Mr. Frumpus?
Have you lost your mind?<eos> - Keith, listen to me.<eos> - No, let me out of here, now!<eos> I can't do that.<eos> Not until I know if I can trust you.
I have no way of verifying what you're telling me, but, what?<eos> I'm supposed to give you unfettered access to the system?<eos> Why would I make all this up?<eos> Do you really think I want to be doing this?<eos> I'm supposed to be with my husband, Keith, helping him with his campaign, now give me the damned override so I can get you out of here and get back to my life.
And there are literally thousands of exit points.<eos> Yeah, Ben knows that.<eos> He's been doing this a while.<eos> This is him.<eos> I'm gonna join you in.
It made me sick that some crackpot imam was spewing that kind of hatred and violence in the name of Islam.<eos> I went to tell everyone there he was distorting our religion.<eos> And you can prove that?<eos> Even if I could, the damage is done, but it's the truth.<eos> I wanted to tell you, I did.
Okay, thanks.<eos> Uh, Tom. I texted you... about getting together to maybe, you know, clear the air.<eos> There's no air that needs clearing.<eos> We have nothing to talk about Andy.<eos> Agent Locke, uh, can I talk to you for a second?
Rebecca, can you hear me? !<eos> Can anyone hear me? !<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Rebecca respects you.
Can anyone hear me? !<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Rebecca respects you.<eos> It's not about not trusting you.
Please.<eos> Please.<eos> I need your help.<eos> Why don't you open that door, explain it to the captain?<eos> I swear to you, there is no time for that.
Stand down.<eos> Lower your weapons.<eos> I have Rebecca Ingram from CTU.<eos> She's explained everything.<eos> She's on the line for you.
Yes, I am.<eos> Now, he's up to speed on everything.<eos> He knows you need to get Grimes the money as soon as possible, so I'm gonna put him on.<eos> Carter, the police are giving you a vehicle and a comm package.<eos> A CTU tac team will follow you to your rendezvous with Grimes.
I'll make sure the tac team stays hidden.<eos> You're not hearing me.<eos> Ben is counter-surveillance trained, okay?<eos> He's also very paranoid.<eos> Carter, Grimes has already gotten away from you once.
We'll adjudicate this another time.<eos> Look, I have to ask.<eos> Nilaa Mizrani... We know she's a leak.<eos> I want to be the one to bring her in.<eos> I keep having to remind you, you don't work here anymore.
- I'll get someone on it for you.<eos> This is Agent Locke.<eos> He's the best tactical specialist in CTU.<eos> He'll be leading the field team.<eos> Now, we have no way of knowing how Grimes will approach you at the station.
He's the best tactical specialist in CTU.<eos> He'll be leading the field team.<eos> Now, we have no way of knowing how Grimes will approach you at the station.<eos> We'll keep the bulk of the tac team out of your line of sight.<eos> Agent Locke will shadow you.
So don't make me a liar.<eos> No, I absolutely agree with that, but...<eos> Why don't you grab a bite to eat first.<eos> I'll catch up with you outside.<eos> Hmm? Thank you so much, both of you.
I had them set up video and audio before they sequestered her.<eos> Your guests are expecting you outside, you should get back to them.<eos> No.<eos> I-I need to see this.<eos> Do you know why I asked to talk to you?
Rebecca's already pulled the footage, and she has a record that Nilaa was at campaign headquarters when her file was breached.<eos> And there are no other cameras?<eos> There's no way that CTU can confirm Nilaa's story?<eos> I went over the route myself, twice.<eos> CTU won't be able to trace the leak back to you.
Step back.<eos> Doors closing.<eos> They're heading to the mezzanine.<eos> Copy that.<eos> Linking you into the station's camera network.
The file was accessed from Nilaa's computer.<eos> She may be facilitating a terrorist attack on domestic soil.<eos> My guy was able to hack the ATM camera, change the time stamp.<eos> Rebecca's already pulled the footage.<eos> CTU won't be able to trace the leak back to you.
Please, I just said, go.<eos> I am not going anywhere until you tell me the truth.<eos> I have told you the truth.<eos> You're not listening.<eos> You understand, I'm trying to help you.
Pull Suarez in to double team.<eos> We need to hit her hard, get something out of her we can use.<eos> Understood.<eos> I want to finish questioning her, Keith.<eos> Right now, I need something else from you.
We don't just go on our gut here, we make decisions based on intel.<eos> And I cannot authorize this mission.<eos> There are too many variables.<eos> Appreciate all you've done for us today, but this is my call.<eos> Agent Wilkes will take you to debrief. Mullins.
Don't make a sound.<eos> Turn over.<eos> Show me your hands.<eos> Now.<eos> I'm not gonna hurt you. Okay?
Turn over.<eos> Show me your hands.<eos> Now.<eos> I'm not gonna hurt you. Okay?<eos> I'm just gonna lock you down.
_<eos> We took a closer look at the security tape from campaign headquarters.<eos> It looks as if it may have been tampered with.<eos> You mean it was faked.<eos> Like I told you from the beginning.
- Of course.<eos> - Good.<eos> Don't want you to drop out like your brother.<eos> Why didn't you tell us you were coming?<eos> I just wanted to surprise you.
You wanted to see me?<eos> I know you helped Carter access the Onyx schematics.<eos> You have no proof of that.<eos> Only because you're good at what you do.<eos> Which means I can't fire you for cause... yet.
I know you helped Carter access the Onyx schematics.<eos> You have no proof of that.<eos> Only because you're good at what you do.<eos> Which means I can't fire you for cause... yet.<eos> But I don't trust you.
The man's responsible for his money.<eos> It's gone.<eos> What do you think the consequences should be?<eos> I'm here to make a deal.<eos> So whatever happened between you two doesn't matter.
Quite a bit, actually.<eos> Stand up.<eos> Now...<eos> I'll never do business with him.<eos> The question on the table is can I do business with you?
No.<eos> That's what I like to see.<eos> Loyalty.<eos> Maybe we can do business.<eos> We'll run background on you.
Give me the phone.<eos> So how do you know they're genuine?<eos> Because I know where I stole them from.<eos> Let me ask you something.<eos> What's to stop me killing you, keeping the plans anyway?
And there's Jadalla, using the name Aashiq Raza.<eos> The addresses on the passports, they're all the same.<eos> CTU, we have it.<eos> Aliases and a potential address.<eos> Sending all to you now.
Aliases and a potential address.<eos> Sending all to you now.<eos> Don't waste any more time.<eos> Gather your assault teams, set up a perimeter at that location.<eos> We'll redirect satellite up-links and reconnect with you onsite.
Okay, good.<eos> Please tell her I'd like to see her.<eos> Thanks.<eos> This is Locke.<eos> Go ahead. Uploading satellite feed and property schematics to you now.
And they almost killed me and my wife.<eos> We'll find them.<eos> But we had them.<eos> I had them!<eos> I found them for you.
Jadalla. Now that I have your attention, listen to me carefully.<eos> The flash drive we got from Grimes is damaged.<eos> We need someone to recover the data.<eos> Carter, did you hear me?<eos> I can't help you with that.
- I've already told him everything. Yeah, we need to go through it again.<eos> We don't know what details might be helpful.<eos> There's an agent waiting for you in the conference room.<eos> Please, John.<eos> I don't want to release you, Mr. Donovan, but your biometrics are clean and with no hard evidence against you...
Of course it is.<eos> It's disgusting.<eos> But if you think this will make Eric do what you want, you're wrong.<eos> Oh, but he will, though.<eos> He will, because he loves you.
That's what it sounded like, but he should've been here by now.<eos> The GPS on his phone and car have gone quiet, and I can't reach anyone on his security team.<eos> How long ago did he call?<eos> 15, 20 minutes.<eos> I'll call you back.
If I suspect for a moment that you've brought CTU, your brother dies first.<eos> You know who comes next.<eos> Andy, you don't have to do this.<eos> Let me call CTU.<eos> They'll back you up.
They'll back you up.<eos> I'm asking you... to find another way.<eos> I don't want to lose you.<eos> Jadalla just sent the GPS coordinates.<eos> When CTU finds you, you better tell them to stay away.
NYPD's working on closing down the tunnels.<eos> Director Mullins.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> You've released my father?<eos> The one person who might be able to lead you to Jadalla Bin-Khalid?
Jadalla has my wife.<eos> And he has my brother.<eos> The flash drive containing the list of sleeper cells has been damaged and he needs somebody to repair it.<eos> You're not actually asking me to repair the drive, are you?<eos> I'm asking you to help me destroy it.
Meantime, this dude gonna tell us where they took Eric.<eos> They messed with the wrong people.<eos> You think you can do this to me and just get away clean?<eos> I'm a powerful man.<eos> This will catch up to you.
How soon until you're ready?<eos> We're close, we're almost done with his medical screens.<eos> How far away is your husband?<eos> Minutes.<eos> I've been able to learn about you.
How far away is your husband?<eos> Minutes.<eos> I've been able to learn about you.<eos> Where you came from, the drugs, the violence.<eos> I was just like you once.
The way he looks at your wife...<eos> I was so blind to the truth.<eos> Until my father died.<eos> Until you murdered him.<eos> I should thank you.
What's happening?<eos> He has triggered a virus.<eos> To erase the flash drive.<eos> Relax.<eos> I'm not going to shoot you.
There is only one possible outcome for all of this, and we both know what that is.<eos> You people will lose.<eos> You don't get it, Jadalla.<eos> This country's so much stronger than your jihad.<eos> And it'll still be standing long after false prophets and lunatics like you are dust.
Faded.<eos> Forgotten.<eos> And for the record... if there is something... anything on your side, it sure as hell isn't God.<eos> We'll see.<eos> I'm gonna ask you again.
I'm gonna ask you again.<eos> How did you and Jadalla Bin-Khalid communicate?<eos> Mr. Donovan.<eos> You have to know that by keeping quiet, you're putting thousands of American lives in danger.<eos> I keep telling you I don't know what you're talking about.
Brah... take care of her.<eos> Isaac.<eos> All right.<eos> And turn your phones off, man, the both of you.<eos> I don't want those bastards or the government to be able to trace you, a'ight?
Think I wouldn't recognize you after what you did?<eos> Why is he calling you Naseri?<eos> Because he's been beaten and he's delirious.<eos> Get back to work.<eos> I'm gonna kill you.
We found a cell call placed from that location in the time frame you gave us.<eos> Is there a way to track the phone or the, the phone he called?<eos> No, both are either powered down or running different SIM cards.<eos> But whoever Naseri talked to was at 1176 Hill Road.<eos> It's a neighborhood not far from you.
What do you want?<eos> Jadalla Bin-Khalid.<eos> - What?<eos> - Your girlfriend is wearing a vest lined with C-4 plastic explosives.<eos> I'm going to tell you exactly what to do and when.
Try to warn anyone...<eos> You will force me to detonate the device.<eos> Please don't do this.<eos> Once we have Jadalla, she'll be released.<eos> Just do what I tell you and your girlfriend will be fine.
And I think Naseri is watching her on some kind of a Web camera.<eos> So, Naseri's using her as leverage.<eos> Yeah, but she can't tell us anything until we defuse the vest.<eos> I might be able to create a video loop.<eos> Like what Andy did for you when you broke into the police station.
That's one thing about Rebecca:<eos> she gets things done, no matter what it takes.<eos> I suppose I shouldn't be mad at her, either.<eos> My fault.<eos> I put you both in impossible situations.
Who the hell you think you are, turning your back on me?<eos> !<eos> I'm your father.<eos> That was the party office.<eos> The chairman can meet you after 11:00.
Return to your studies if you want.<eos> Asim Naseri escaped from the warehouse.<eos> We want to know what operation he's running and how to find him.<eos> I don't know anyone named Naseri.<eos> Eric Carter saw him with you.
Send them to the annex office.<eos> I'll review them there.<eos> I'm in.<eos> Carter, the loop is live.<eos> Theo's ready to walk you through the disarming procedure.
Carter?<eos> Carter?<eos> Carter?<eos> We're good.<eos> Jennifer, I need to know why they did this to you.
Jennifer, I need to know why they did this to you.<eos> It's over?<eos> It's really over?<eos> It's over.<eos> Who were they leveraging you against?
No, those who, for whatever their reasons, murder innocent people.<eos> On that score, your wife is second to none.<eos> And you're a liar.<eos> I wonder if you really don't know what I'm talking about.<eos> I'd tell you to ask her, but you're never gonna see her again.
"East July"?<eos> Uh, are you sure?<eos> He said it a couple times, yeah.<eos> - Andy. - Yeah.<eos> Director Mullins needs to speak with you.
- Yeah, thanks.<eos> Got it.<eos> You wanted to see me?<eos> You know where Rebecca is?<eos> I thought she was out here with you.
The terrorists you tried to help her hunt down, they've abducted Senator John Donovan.<eos> Now Rebecca intends to surrender herself to the terrorists in exchange for her husband's life.<eos> How do you know this?<eos> We intercepted a fragment of a phone call she had with Jadalla Bin-Khalid.<eos> Has Rebecca tried contacting you at all?
Mr. Almeida, this is Andy Shalowitz.<eos> Um, send me the specs.<eos> I might be able to wake up the device with an activation code.<eos> We just need one ping.<eos> All right, I'll dig 'em up and send them to you.
Just, uh she thinks I need this.<eos> Do you?<eos> - I'm on my way.<eos> - Good.<eos> And I remind you again, if I see any sign that you're not alone...
Yeah?<eos> I got a hit.<eos> "East July" is a subheading of some folders in the server at the office of the D.N.I.<eos> Well, what was in it?<eos> I don't know, I can't tell you.
Now do what I say, or my men will put a bullet in his head.<eos> I don't believe you'll do that.<eos> It's me you want.<eos> You told me yourself.<eos> My husband means nothing to you.
Show me proof that my husband is free and safe, and I'll walk into that field.<eos> You have my word.<eos> This conversation is over.<eos> Then I will turn around and I will walk away.<eos> And I will re-dedicate my life to hunting you down.
Jadalla!<eos> Jadalla!<eos> It's Carter.<eos> Get me Director Mullins.<eos> Carter's on the line for you.
Eric.<eos> Rebecca!<eos> Where are you?<eos> Carter, what is it?<eos> I think I heard her, I'm patching you in.
It's obvious that you need all the help that you can get now.<eos> Sir, I'm perfectly willing to take responsibility for everything that's gone wrong, but...<eos> Daniel' s an administrator.<eos> H-He has no field experience and...<eos> Which is why I'm keeping you there to fill the gaps.
Thank you for your cooperation, Keith.<eos> Absolutely, anything I can do.<eos> Daniel.<eos> Keith.<eos> Did Director Simms reach you?
What are you talking about?<eos> - I just hacked into his server.<eos> - You what?<eos> Pang is here because of what I found on Director Simms.<eos> I'd like to talk to you in private, now.
Yeah, come on.<eos> Look, I don't know if you found anything, but just have CTU check anyway.<eos> Roger that, sir.<eos> Senator.<eos> Rebecca talked about you, talked about you a lot, about your missions together.
Look, I don't know if you found anything, but just have CTU check anyway.<eos> Roger that, sir.<eos> Senator.<eos> Rebecca talked about you, talked about you a lot, about your missions together.<eos> So I, I feel like I almost, I almost know you.
Roger that, sir.<eos> Senator.<eos> Rebecca talked about you, talked about you a lot, about your missions together.<eos> So I, I feel like I almost, I almost know you.<eos> She, uh, admired you, you should know that.
I-I... Sir, I thought this was a good plan.<eos> You thought it was a good plan to help her turn herself over to these monsters?<eos> No, I...<eos> Listen, that, that wasn't supposed to happen.<eos> She was gonna get them to release you, and then draw Naseri out so that I could take him down.
Okay? Oh, God.<eos> And... they got to her before I could, and I just...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I am sorry, but I still think there's time t-to save Rebecca.<eos> Well, I wish I could believe that, but like you, I came face-to-face with this Naseri and Bin-Khalid.
I'm told we have no leads.<eos> We don't know where the hell they are.<eos> All I'm hearing is that my wife is gonna die a terrible death, and everyone's gonna see it.<eos> Sir, we'll... we're gonna find her!<eos> Sir, we've got a medic here who needs to see you.
I can be over there in about ten minutes.<eos> You're coming here?<eos> Is there a problem with that?<eos> Not at all. Um...<eos> I'm just thinking I can fill you in, uh, over the phone.
Is there a problem with that?<eos> Not at all. Um...<eos> I'm just thinking I can fill you in, uh, over the phone.<eos> Don... you know Rebecca just gave herself up for me.<eos> I think I need to look you in the eye when you tell me what her chances are.
Was she really taken?<eos> Yeah, unfortunately.<eos> I've got every agency looking for her.<eos> It's our highest priority.<eos> But I'm calling you about something else.
Yeah, unfortunately.<eos> I've got every agency looking for her.<eos> It's our highest priority.<eos> But I'm calling you about something else.<eos> I have a job for you.
Grab this.<eos> Put pressure on it.<eos> Keep pressing.<eos> I was wrong, Eric.<eos> I shouldn't have come down on you like that before.
I'm on it, sir.<eos> I'm sure you are.<eos> I don't know what your thinking is on Keith Mullins, long term, but I can already see I can make a big difference here.<eos> Get this done, then we'll talk about it.<eos> I'll check with you later.
Good.<eos> Cover him.<eos> Andy, Simms is secure.<eos> I'm logging in to the terminal now.<eos> Go to the I.P. address I gave you.
No wonder this place is in the crapper.<eos> Hey! Inside the house!<eos> We only want the girl!<eos> Just send her out and then we're done.<eos> Listen to me, the man that hired you, Simms, he's been taken down.
I can't do that.<eos> If they get to Naseri's daughter,<eos> Rebecca will die.<eos> Do you understand that?<eos> I wish I could help you, John.
We've sent Eric Carter there to protect her.<eos> Naseri thinks she's dead, which means if he finds out that she's alive, there might be a chance that he would trade her for Rebecca.<eos> But that won't happen, Tony, unless you release Carter and that girl.<eos> Simms told me they weren't connected.<eos> Well, he lied to you.
All right, go get the girl and take her out of here.<eos> Just like that?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Let it go, Sidra.<eos> I'd go with you myself, if you hadn't've broken my damn arm.
What about them?<eos> Did you do it because you thought we killed your daughter?<eos> That father was a traitor.<eos> But his children weren't.<eos> I am not going to explain myself to you, Mr. Carter.
But his children weren't.<eos> I am not going to explain myself to you, Mr. Carter.<eos> Mr. Hammad?<eos> Yes.<eos> We're just waiting for the go-ahead, then I'll walk the girl over to you.
The exchange took place, the girl is safe, but, sir, there-there was gunfire and Rebecca was hit.<eos> How-How bad, Mullins?<eos> How bad?<eos> It's serious, but there's an ambulance on the way and they'll go to the nearest hospital, St. Catherine's.<eos> We're gonna send a car for you.
I'm your nurse, we're in the E.R.<eos> - John.<eos> - Senator, back up.<eos> They need to work, they need to work.<eos> We're gonna take good care of you, all right?
Resume.<eos> _<eos> Senator...<eos> Your father is here.<eos> He wants to see you.
Nilaa, they're calling early.<eos> - It's not the party.<eos> - Um, I can't right n... what?<eos> Uh, there's an FBI agent out here.<eos> He says he needs to see you, something about DNI Simms.
Uh, I need to step out for a few minutes.<eos> Can I stay with her?<eos> Senator.<eos> I'm Agent Dietrich.<eos> I'm sorry to disturb you, but Director Simms was found dead in his office earlier this morning.
The sooner they know, the sooner they can pick another candidate.<eos> I'm not dropping out of the race.<eos> We need to talk this through.<eos> Mr. Carter.<eos> Director Mullins is expecting you.
Alright, yeah.<eos> Throw strong. Come on, son.<eos> Yeah, alright.<eos> Let's do this.<eos> - I haven't seen you around here before.
I'm online here with a couple players.<eos> Sure.<eos> What? I... nothing.<eos> Shit.<eos> Can I help you?
Sure.<eos> What? I... nothing.<eos> Shit.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> I said, can I help you?
I'm gonna put these down and grab a drink. Would you like something?<eos> - No, thank you.<eos> - He already has a beer.<eos> I also have real Masala Chai tea, if you'd rather.<eos> - That sounds lovely, thank you, Ellen.
It tastes like home.<eos> That's sweet of you. I'm glad you're enjoying it.<eos> Imir's been helping me write Dad's eulogy.<eos> Really?<eos> - I'm surprised he mentioned it to you.
- Yeah, no kidding.<eos> To everyone's health. Including financially.<eos> And lastly, to my father.<eos> For as long as I can remember he loved the sea. And he loved that boat.<eos> Imir we're passing on a piece of Wiston family history to you and I know we've only just met but I think my dad would approve.
Just answer the question, will ya?<eos> Why? What's this about?<eos> I'll call you in the morning.<eos> Listen, we should probably go over the spec on the boat and the registration.<eos> Can I see you in my office for a minute?
Give it.<eos> Look... Look, your family is dead.<eos> I know, and I'm sorry. I really am. But...<eos> You know exactly what this has to do with you.<eos> I told you! I write code for a living!
Why are you doing this?<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> Please...<eos> - What is this, you sick fuck!<eos> - I learned this from you.
- Who said anything about revenge?<eos> - Well, why else would you be here?<eos> Haven't you listened to anything I've said?<eos> I'm listening. I'm listening.<eos> Please tell us how we can help you.
He chained those he felt most likely to revolt over the offense.<eos> Though, I imagine they know this.<eos> With what conditions?<eos> Two of them.<eos> They respect you, so they'll listen to you.
It would have been so easy to lessen your suffering by divulging the secret.<eos> And yet, he never did.<eos> Have you yet asked yourself why that is?<eos> My father didn't mistrust Flint.<eos> My father mistrusted all of you.
The cache isn't here, so I am leaving.<eos> And as my collateral to ensure that this deal is consummated, he'll be coming with me to the fort.<eos> "This deal"?<eos> As in the one in which you walk away with all my money?<eos> It seems the only means I have of registering any meaningful disapproval of this deal at this point is to kill one or the both of you.
And our men...<eos> Billy, I could walk out there and tell them the sky is red... and they'd believe me.<eos> That's the power you've given me.<eos> But I have to know this is over... your vendetta against Flint, your need to see him dead or departed from our story.<eos> I have to know you'll never put me to a choice between you again.
_<eos> English, God damn it!<eos> Even if that order could be given, no one would heed it.<eos> They've been let loose.<eos> I opened the gates for you.
We have to assume the Spanish have men all across the island by now.<eos> Every hour we sit here is an hour closer to being sighted by them... if we haven't been sighted already.<eos> She saw Anne?<eos> We'll give them another hour, then we'll set sail.<eos> Seems a fair amount of resentment towards you these days.
"What result?" That result was because of your goddamn betrayal!<eos> Just now, that man and several others wondered aloud whether the smartest thing to do wouldn't be killing you and throwing you in the sea rather than giving you another opportunity to fuck us!<eos> For reasons I can't begin to fathom, I argued against it.<eos> Bark at me again about braver, stronger, and smarter men, and I might decide to revisit the issue!<eos> If killing me seems like the smartest thing to do, then it is obvious to me none of you have any idea how to defeat Woodes Rogers.
Can't you see it?<eos> After I just climbed that fucking hill, are you being serious right now?<eos> In a few weeks time, I will lead a pirate fleet of unprecedented strength over that horizon into a battle of unprecedented importance.<eos> With a little luck, that battle will end with us taking Nassau and beginning a revolution.<eos> I cannot do it without you.
I cannot do it without you.<eos> So it would benefit all involved, you not the least, if, when the battle begins, you aren't killed by the first fool lucky enough to swing a sword your way.<eos> You wanna teach me to fight?<eos> I know you know how to fight.<eos> I want to teach you how to fight and not die.
If they say you know his mind as if it were your own, we thought you might have a better idea which way he went than we could.<eos> How in the fuck would I know which way he decided to go?<eos> All Flint needs is an hour, maybe less, to conceal that chest in a way we couldn't hope to recover.<eos> Every moment we stand here deliberating is a moment closer to his victory.<eos> The three of you, that way.
How exactly is one supposed to watch two points in space at the same time?<eos> Practice.<eos> All warfare is the same.<eos> Two questions are of paramount importance... who was my opponent yesterday, and who is he today?<eos> Answer those two questions, and there is very little he can... hide from you.
I'm sorry, the more I try and dismiss this, I...<eos> You know my story.<eos> Thomas, Miranda, all of it.<eos> Know the role it played in motivating me to do the things that I've done, the things I will do.<eos> It has made me transparent to you.
If I must compromise to avert a dark end, then so must you.<eos> I've offered you freedom for your people.<eos> I have offered you more than you have any right to expect.<eos> And still, you will not say yes.<eos> So I come to you one last time, to ensure you cannot say no.
- Accept the treaty...<eos> - I will consider no treaty of yours.<eos> And John Silver lives.<eos> Refuse... and he dies... along with the rest of the men who followed him here.<eos> And from what I understand, he is the one who matters most to you.
But I hear other voices.<eos> A chorus of voices.<eos> Multitudes.<eos> They reach back centuries.<eos> Men and women... and children who'd lost their lives... to men like you.
Fuck!<eos> You're still leaning forward.<eos> Let's go again.<eos> I have no story to tell.<eos> It all might seem as though I'm trying to conceal something from you, but... truth is... there is no story to tell.
What is it?<eos> James said he saw him clutch for his chest.<eos> Then... he just dropped.<eos> Should we...?<eos> So, you asked him to recount for you what he knew days ago, yes?
Abandon ship! - Abandon ship! - All hands!<eos> It would be preferable to me if we resolved this another way.<eos> Cache is in the ground by now.<eos> And I'll need as many men as we can get for what comes next.<eos> That includes you.
I know you cannot see why this must be.<eos> But it must be.<eos> And every moment we waste is a moment we could be working to retrieve her.<eos> That's all this has ever been, isn't it?<eos> A partnership only insofar as it enables you to do whatever it is that matters to you in any given moment.
But it must be.<eos> And every moment we waste is a moment we could be working to retrieve her.<eos> That's all this has ever been, isn't it?<eos> A partnership only insofar as it enables you to do whatever it is that matters to you in any given moment.<eos> And right now it matters far less to you whether she lives or dies than it happens your way, on your terms.
- I guess who I am is...<eos> - ...exactly the same as who you are.<eos> - Not better than.<eos> - Not less than.<eos> Because there is no one who has been or will ever be exactly the same as either you or me.
Have a great night.<eos> Zakia.<eos> Uh... what?<eos> My name is Zakia.<eos> Pleased to meet you.
Support is the open secret of any successful marriage.<eos> Mum?<eos> It is as your father says it is, Rajan.<eos> This is a momentous occasion indeed.<eos> May I offer my congratulations to you, Manendra?
No one believed me.<eos> Not even my dad, but... she did.<eos> You can see her?<eos> You can see our daughter?<eos> She's next to you.
He's been better.<eos> Is he here now?<eos> Will... I hope you find some peace.<eos> Thank you.<eos> He says, "Thank you."
Vitals.<eos> Nomi!<eos> [Wolfgang] Come on.<eos> Hurry.<eos> [Kala] Almost... [gasps] [man] Let me be clear, I don't trust you anymore. Do you understand?
Corporate letterhead: "I.F.G.F."<eos> Got it.<eos> I've had it with you crying wolf every time your project comes under scrutiny.<eos> Graduation ring, Yale insignia.<eos> What is wrong with you, man?
- Gibbons!<eos> - I have to go!<eos> Gibbons!<eos> You think you're hunting us?<eos> We're coming for you.
How about this 50-year-old Scotch over there?<eos> No.<eos> No, I'm joking.<eos> Marvelous choice.<eos> - Nice crib. - Thank you.
- Nice crib. - Thank you.<eos> And speaking of talent, allow me to introduce my extraordinary right hand.<eos> I would be lost without her.<eos> Lila Facchini.<eos> Pleasure to meet you.
The same is true for our ears.<eos> The music of Mozart was not heard by the people of his time the way we hear it today.<eos> Why?<eos> Because our senses, including our common sense, are evolving.<eos> And I think that is because of people like you.
His eyes are looking to the future.<eos> And that's exactly where I'm looking.<eos> There's a strong group of us inside BPO.<eos> We believe we can change the present direction of the organization back to the vision of Dr. El-Saadawi.<eos> What I want from you is time.
Two of our favorite writers and I'm stuck on a boat.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Well, the video of our recording has already hit over a million views.<eos> - [laughs] - [laughs] The TV station has never seen anything like it.<eos> So, my boss, Kobi Kihara, was wondering if we could do a follow-up story on you.
- What are you gonna do?<eos> Lose him.<eos> [crowd chanting] One truth!<eos> Neets!<eos> - I know you! I know you!
Looking good. Van Damn.<eos> So, first of all, Capheus, welcome to the show.<eos> Thank you, Miss Kihara.<eos> It is a very big honor for me to be here.<eos> Very kind of you to say, and "Kobi" is just fine.
I knew they were lying.<eos> When they came here, they were looking for something.<eos> They did not find it.<eos> You see?<eos> My son believed his secrets would be safe with you.
You and she were cellmates, weren't you?<eos> The only thing I hate more than rhetorical questions... stupid rhetorical questions.<eos> Harboring fugitives, Mrs. Cho...<eos> that's a serious crime.<eos> I don't want to have to put you back in prison.
Where are you?<eos> Listen...<eos> I love you.<eos> I don't know what an actor can do to help put the memory of my son to rest.<eos> But he obviously thought highly of you.
I have to go.<eos> I know.<eos> I prepared this.<eos> Food, some clothes, money.<eos> I do not know how to thank you.
I fall in love with the person, not their genitals.<eos> Which may sound weird to you.<eos> No.<eos> Not at all.<eos> Look, I'm not someone who usually talks like a greeting card, but... lately, I've come to see that luck is something that reminds you how beautiful the world can be.
Hello.<eos> - Thank you!<eos> - My God! I'm one of your biggest fans!<eos> - Thank you very much. - Oh, where...<eos> - I love you so much!
Do you have to do everything so intensely?<eos> No.<eos> Just the things that matter.<eos> These are the last year reports from the controller general. Yeah, you can just put them there.<eos> - Thank you.
You just love to look at the bad stuff.<eos> - Yeah, that is true.<eos> Oh, my God. Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, my God. Look! Look!<eos> Now... a man who needs no introduction, but I'll introduce to you anyhow.
Thank you, São Paulo!<eos> Thank you.<eos> I wanted to say that I am very honored to be here.<eos> That isn't the truth.<eos> To be honest with you, I... I have never been as scared as I am right now.
Good morning, Mr. Secretary.<eos> The Chairman is very excited.<eos> It's a very big day for us.<eos> - It is.<eos> - We are counting on you.
Soundproofing. Eighteen inches thick.<eos> All the modern amenities of a coffin.<eos> Aye.<eos> So, Miss Blue, if you and your laddie are not a pair of headhunters, putting on your show was a terrible risk.<eos> Care to explain what possessed you?
Aye.<eos> So, Miss Blue, if you and your laddie are not a pair of headhunters, putting on your show was a terrible risk.<eos> Care to explain what possessed you?<eos> Well, Mr. Hoy, if you're not a BPO headhunter, then leaving your coffin to come to my show was a terrible risk.<eos> - What possessed you?
Do you think they might be right?<eos> I'll go to Iceland.<eos> She's fighting with her cluster.<eos> Be careful.<eos> Can I ask you about one of the BPO hunters?
She's fighting with her cluster.<eos> Be careful.<eos> Can I ask you about one of the BPO hunters?<eos> Do you know him?<eos> If he's the one that's after you, I must say, I underestimated either your recklessness or your courage.
Mr. Hoy said I have to go to Chicago.<eos> But I have to go alone.<eos> Nom!<eos> Dr. Metzger.<eos> I don't know what they taught you in med school, but the word "helping" doesn't mean handcuff people and chop up their brains.
Prep her for surgery.<eos> Nomi, what have you done?<eos> Is he in there?<eos> What is he doing?<eos> I told you, he's trying to destroy my work.
Trying to change the world only leads to suffering.<eos> All we can change is ourselves.<eos> I'm not sure I agree.<eos> I know.<eos> That's why I can't help you.
"Copulation for a better nation."<eos> By having sex with every homie in Oakland.<eos> - By any means necessary.<eos> - Mom! They exaggerate, honey.<eos> Oh, I just think it's amazing that none of you ever cared that you didn't know who her biological dad was.
Want to go again... faggot?<eos> Only if you want your ass kicked by a faggot.<eos> Again.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Stop it. I'm not going anywhere with you.
That is a strong allegation, Ms. Bak.<eos> It's not an allegation, it is a fact, Detective.<eos> Do you then have evidence to prove it?<eos> I know what my brother has done.<eos> And I do not require you or the law to believe me.
Listen to yourself, Detective.<eos> Is this the system you serve?<eos> Yeah.<eos> The law is imperfect.<eos> I'm asking you to trust me and I swear I will protect you.
The law is imperfect.<eos> I'm asking you to trust me and I swear I will protect you.<eos> I don't need anyone's protection.<eos> Are you sure about that?<eos> I promised I only wanted to talk, so I'm not gonna stop you if you prefer to leave.
No.<eos> Five minutes.<eos> In five minutes, I send in Diego.<eos> I needed to know how far you would go.<eos> I needed to know if I could trust you.
I owe you nothing! Nothing!<eos> You're not gonna do anything!<eos> You know what?<eos> This is over!<eos> I told you, it's over! I'm done!
Riley.<eos> Is Nomi okay?<eos> She'll be fine.<eos> Lola says she's a bit concussed but she'll sleep it off.<eos> She was more worried about you.
I know sometimes I say things I shouldn't.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> I would ask the same thing.<eos> You want to know what it's like between Will and me.<eos> It's much more intense than when I visit with any of you.
I never understood the word "presence" until we were together.<eos> And if you're wondering about the sex... no matter what I say, it won't be enough.<eos> Yeah, it's pretty amazing.<eos> And what about now?<eos> What's it like when one of you is in pain?
Maybe... Maybe you didn't go to your father because, in the end, he wasn't that important to you.<eos> Maybe you're not the son you thought you were.<eos> I can imagine facing that truth would be particularly painful.<eos> You and I? We are getting closer and closer, Will.<eos> Mr. Wrangler will see you now.
That's right, kid.<eos> In your Hollywood debut, you will be falling in love with three-time Academy Award-winning actor<eos> Blake Huntington.<eos> Why do you care so much about those things?<eos> I'm guessing he already told you what he did with his.
For too long, we have elected liars.<eos> And hypocrites.<eos> We have elected thieves.<eos> The time has come to elect a real man.<eos> I give you, from the Kenya Democratic Reform Party...
Please.<eos> No!<eos> Please, stop!<eos> Please!<eos> We have to get you out of here!
Please!<eos> We have to get you out of here!<eos> Wait!<eos> What about my family?<eos> Your family is safer without you. Come on, let's go!
Please.<eos> Well... you gotta do it now.<eos> Is this working?<eos> My name is Nomi. I am Teagan's only sibling, which means, yes, I am her former brother-now-sister.<eos> This may come as a surprise to some of you.
Excuse me!<eos> I'm really sorry about this.<eos> I wish I didn't have to do this, but I don't have a choice.<eos> Special Agent Bendix, FBI.<eos> - I'm going to ask all of you...
I told you not to include him.<eos> No.<eos> I won't let you.<eos> If you want to finish your sacred rite, get out of the way.<eos> Otherwise, I can take you downtown, too.
What did you do?<eos> She did something!<eos> She did some kind of hacking!<eos> This is bullshit!<eos> Take your hands off my daughter... or I promise you, I will pursue a suit seeking the kind of damages that end the careers of men like you.
- I mean, everyone makes mistakes.<eos> But I think it's important to make amends when appropriate.<eos> As I said, you really didn't have to.<eos> No, but I did.<eos> And my karma has rewarded me with another opportunity to talk to you.
Yeah, sure.<eos> And once again, congratulations to you both.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Bye for now.<eos> Might I have a word with you, Mr. Secretary?
I've been meaning to talk with you.
If anything in your environment strikes you as a bit odd, a bit off, pick up the phone.<eos> Whether it's a package or a person that seems out of place, we'd love you to let us know.<eos> Because there's a lot of noise out there these days.<eos> A noisy press that's choosing to dwell on the past instead of what's happening right now.<eos> My husband and I want to protect you.
Cleared?<eos> Please.<eos> The White House has not had a single press briefing since the Herald ran my article.<eos> You keep saying the White House isn't speaking about this.<eos> I am sitting right here talking to you.
She was defending the mother online.<eos> - When?<eos> - This afternoon.<eos> The timing is not good on this.<eos> - I can show you.
I want my lawyer.<eos> What for?<eos> I'm sorry, I don't know why I said that.<eos> I don't know why I say anything anymore.<eos> I wanted to see you... to ask you a simple question.
There are so many hardworking mothers and fathers out there.<eos> This could've happened to any of them.<eos> We are close to capturing your son, Ms. Masterson, and I will do my best to have you see him.<eos> I want to go.<eos> No one's keeping you.
Well, I'm a big fan of American law enforcement.<eos> They'll find him soon enough.<eos> We can't just let Francis Underwood turn us into a nation that's always looking over their shoulder.<eos> If you can get yourself onto that committee, I got a feeling the Chair will give you all the time you need.<eos> My driver will take you back to your car. But, Congressman... this is your chance.
My driver will take you back to your car. But, Congressman... this is your chance.<eos> And I think you know it.<eos> Thank you so much for coming out here.<eos> Thank you so much for coming out.<eos> Great to see you. Thanks for coming out.
What did you see?<eos> Was it the girl?<eos> Did you see her first?<eos> What did you see?<eos> Or did she see you first?
Did you see her first?<eos> What did you see?<eos> Or did she see you first?<eos> Yeah, that's it, isn't it?<eos> She saw you.
What did you see?<eos> Or did she see you first?<eos> Yeah, that's it, isn't it?<eos> She saw you.<eos> She looked right through you, didn't she?
Hello. This is Francis Underwood.<eos> It's him.<eos> The committee is looking for Remy Danton and Jackie Sharp.<eos> What do either of them have to do with ICO or the war?<eos> The talk up on the Hill is they're going to invite you and the rest of your staff to testify.
Well, perhaps if you could just calm down for a moment.<eos> Please stop it.<eos> I thought this news would bring you some relief.<eos> The president called Mrs. Miller.<eos> I promised you and your daughter that I would...
I promised you and your daughter that I would...<eos> Leave her alone.<eos> Well, perhaps we should speak when you're feeling a little more up to it.<eos> I don't want to hear you.<eos> Or from you. - What you did to my family...
I refuse to be intimidated by my own house.<eos> It's cold down here.<eos> What's that?<eos> Just me.<eos> Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.
Yeah, well, if we were to replace this one, how much would it cost?<eos> Well, I'll let you know when I'm done with my assessment.<eos> Just trying to figure out where all these pipes lead.<eos> Lot of pipe down here.<eos> Okay, we'll leave you to it, and you'll let us know when you have an estimate?
What's he like, what's his name?<eos> Oh, excuse me, do you work here?<eos> I do, but unfortunately, I just started my ten minute break.<eos> His name is Patrick.<eos> Someone else here would be happy to help you.
I do, but unfortunately, I just started my ten minute break.<eos> His name is Patrick.<eos> Someone else here would be happy to help you.<eos> Oh, I don't want someone else.<eos> I just want you.
I just want you.<eos> What the hell is your husband doing?<eos> He's probably just trying to get us a table earlier.<eos> - Cabernet. - Yeah, that's totally what he's doing.<eos> Can I let you in on a little secret?
Can I let you in on a little secret?<eos> You couldn't have me if hell froze over.<eos> What if I told you...<eos> To the keeper that Paul is.<eos> I could provide you with the most explosive sexual experience of your entire life.
I could provide you with the most explosive sexual experience of your entire life.<eos> Four words.<eos> "Never going to happen."<eos> Never say never.<eos> Excuse me sir, can I help you with something from the bar?
- Yeah. It was my fault.<eos> - Don't worry about that.<eos> I'll recover.<eos> - Are you Mrs. hemdale?<eos> Yes, can I help you? No.
- Don't worry about that.<eos> I'll recover.<eos> - Are you Mrs. hemdale?<eos> Yes, can I help you? No.<eos> But I think I can help you.
Have you been in the cellar?<eos> Have you seen the black room?<eos> Leave!<eos> Take your husband and get out!<eos> It'll try to seduce you, trick you with pleasure, make you want more.
My grandmother... Did not disappear, like they say.<eos> She was swallowed up by that house.<eos> She died saving my life...<eos> Trying to trap the evil that was summoned decades earlier.<eos> Get out, before it takes you, too! Body and soul.
Professor Amory.<eos> My daughter Patricia.<eos> Detective Constable Morse, City Police, Professor, Miss Amory.<eos> Actually, it's Dr Amory, but I prefer Pat.<eos> What can we do for you, Constable?
Yes, certainly, an integral member of the team.<eos> Is there news?<eos> I'm afraid a body was recovered from just below Magdalen Bridge about an hour ago.<eos> The clothes on the body match the description we have of those he was last seen wearing.<eos> Sorry to have to tell you.
There's a Russian arriving at Lovelace College tomorrow for the chess tournament.<eos> It's Special Branch's bailiwick, but Division want the local force represented.<eos> You've some Russian, I believe, from your time in Signals.<eos> The barest smattering, sir.<eos> That still puts you ahead of the rest of us.
I'm a Lowlands man, myself.<eos> Red brick and chippy with everything.<eos> But, seriously, you must come over. I keep a pretty descent cellar.<eos> I'm sure whatever state it's in it's better than my own.<eos> Nice to meet you.
There's a route through the boiler room to an unsecured service hatch.<eos> Recent footprints in the dust, how Edison got in, presumably.<eos> I'll get a photographer down there.<eos> Finish up here, then you and Trewlove bring his parents in.<eos> I'll see you back at the station.
No stone unturned, you have my word.<eos> I just can't understand what he was doing there.<eos> Why?<eos> Edison couldn't swim.<eos> Right, gentlemen, I'm fairly confident this will be of interest to you both.
- No.<eos> Initial tests suggest traces of fluoride.<eos> Tap water?<eos> All I can tell you is that wherever he drowned, it wasn't in Cowley Baths.<eos> A case of this magnitude, multiple victims and a motive as yet unknown, I'm sure I don't have to impress on you the need for absolute discretion.
Perhaps speak to Bernard.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Yes, I argued with Richard.<eos> We overspent our research budget by quite a margin.<eos> And that caused conflict between you and Dr Nielsen?
- Did you give them to him?<eos> - No.<eos> I think he took them just before he disappeared.<eos> There you are.<eos> Just the man. I've been looking for you.
Well, I wasn't sure if you would come.<eos> So, I thought, erm, we'd treat ourselves to a little drop.<eos> Oh, the '61.<eos> I'm honoured.<eos> Well, If I was really honouring you, I would have brought up the '45, but, erm, perhaps when I know you better.
Would you...?<eos> Would you like me to change the music?<eos> I gather opera's more your bag.<eos> Oh, look, don't think too badly of her.<eos> Dorothea holds you in some regard.
- Leave Oxford?<eos> - Why not?<eos> Fresh start.<eos> You've no family local.<eos> As I understand it, there's nothing to keep you here.
Hello? Is anyone there?<eos> Three in the...<eos> Binsey area.<eos> Ashcourt, Ashton and Leighton-Asbury.<eos> - Well, sorry to have troubled you, Mrs Ashcourt.
She'd need somewhere to keep her notebook.<eos> Her coat is here.<eos> I can't see her going far without a handbag.<eos> That poor girl.<eos> I should've listened to you.
You always know.<eos> And you were cheated with your Sergeant's.<eos> I know you wanted it.<eos> Deserved it too.<eos> But I can't say I'm sorry not to lose you to Nights.
It's not Gibbs.<eos> - You think Dr Castle is the Leighton-Asbury boy? - Yes.<eos> After his sister killed herself, he went to his grandparents in Scotland.<eos> - Their name was King.<eos> - How does that get you to Castle?
- My God!<eos> You're him.<eos> You're Alexander.<eos> Well, I'm flattered you remember me.<eos> I remember you, of course.
I remember you, of course.<eos> The disgusting insinuations you made after the inquest.<eos> - I wrote the truth.<eos> - I loved my sister.<eos> Well, she didn't love you.
- I wrote the truth.<eos> - I loved my sister.<eos> Well, she didn't love you.<eos> Not in the way you wanted her to.<eos> She was afraid of you.
I think that's him.<eos> Get after him!<eos> I'll take care of her.<eos> It's all right!<eos> I'll get you out!
Hide. Ahhh!<eos> Not bad, huh?<eos> Yo, seriously?<eos> Are you not paying attention here?<eos> Get your asses up off the floor before this one shoots you.
Sounds good to you?<eos> Best plan ever.<eos> I'm heading out.<eos> You know, you could probably leave your boxes packed.<eos> Easier to clear out when MCC calls and fires you.
You forgot salty.<eos> Now he doesn't have the magic combination.<eos> Idiot.<eos> This where you're keeping guards?<eos> We got a big one here for you.
I know.<eos> I know, and that was wrong, but I was trying to prevent one tragedy from becoming two.<eos> Taystee, what's your endgame here?<eos> How long do you think you can keep us?<eos> They're gonna notice you're missing during count. They're gonna come looking for you.
But if you know anything about the history of riots, you know they don't end well. - They never end well.<eos> - Uh-uh. We, we're gonna get it done.<eos> I hope you do.<eos> Uh, I really have to pee.<eos> Oh, I can help you with that.
- It's, um, it's a healing river.<eos> - Can it reattach hands?<eos> - Maybe.<eos> - I'm going.<eos> - I'll catch you on the flip.
- He may have drowned.<eos> - Are you kidding?<eos> - Why didn't you...<eos> - oh, oh, oh. - There we go.<eos> Are you sure I can't interest you in an elixir?
- Here.<eos> - When you meet one scammer, you met 'em all. Let's go.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Okay, so this net... - This net you throw, what sort of a net catches a god?<eos> - Oh, it's an obscure bit of casting, but I assure you it works.
- Brakebills?<eos> - Hello?<eos> - Mr., uh, Mr...<eos> Fuck!<eos> - Can I help you?
Can't you hear the excitement in my voice?<eos> 'Rohan, please be there at 10:45 am, okay? '<eos> I'll be there on time.<eos> Please don't worry. - 'Okay.'<eos> But Mrs. Mukherjee, it would be nice to have you there too.
It would be better if Rohan joins Supriya here while we both sit at another table.<eos> The 'Pav Bhaji' here is very famous.<eos> Rohan, should I order you one?<eos> - No, I'm good.<eos> Ma'am, I'm ordering one for you.
This is what my wife Jaya complains about too.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you, Mr. Amit.<eos> May God bless you with a happy married life.<eos> This is my blessing to you.
Come on out, everyone.<eos> What is it, Supriya?<eos> Why did you scream?<eos> - These boys are bothering us.<eos> But there is no one here except you two.
Pay more attention on your duty than my calls.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> - Take her to the hospital for the medical.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Listen, Mr. Chaube has sent a car for you.
Yes, sir.<eos> Listen, Mr. Chaube has sent a car for you.<eos> It just got a little late.<eos> Let us go to the hospital now.<eos> And sir has summoned you to the police station.
Rohan!<eos> The hospital is here.<eos> - Thank you, sir.<eos> Your report is ready.<eos> The doctor will see you now.
Mr. Bhatnagar, do not expect much from this report.<eos> The 24 hours following the molestation are the most critical for evidence.<eos> You have showed up after 30 hours, that too, drenched.<eos> All evidence seems to have been washed away.<eos> What! They kidnapped you and locked you up? And then left you in the sea?
I will not come.<eos> But I will not leave until I meet Mr. Chaube.<eos> Is it?<eos> Don't you understand that he is out?<eos> Mr. Chaube, I need to talk to you.
They did it again with my Su.. - What!<eos> What nonsense!<eos> - Don't worry, Inspector Nalavde.<eos> I will not make the mistake of filing a complaint again.<eos> Besides.. I have no hopes from you, neither does Su.
What nonsense!<eos> - Don't worry, Inspector Nalavde.<eos> I will not make the mistake of filing a complaint again.<eos> Besides.. I have no hopes from you, neither does Su.<eos> I was here to tell you that had your system helped us a little bit I wouldn't have to do anything.
So, should I release him?<eos> - Who?<eos> Mr. Shelar, on your saying I locked Wasim up for three days.<eos> Are you drunk?<eos> When did I tell you to lock him up?
Do people keep witnesses next to them before going to sleep?<eos> But why are you asking me this, sir?<eos> Because last night, Wasim got killed.<eos> And you think I did it?<eos> I didn't think about it but when I saw you at his funeral today
We have breakfast at Grandma's, 8 AM sharp.<eos> - Are you sure?<eos> - Hmm. - They're playing our song.<eos> - Again?<eos> I'll run you home.
Three years sound pretty good to me, considering.<eos> Considering what?<eos> They didn't do it!<eos> Mrs Fick, in a Jury trial... there's always a risk.<eos> And a good attorney advises you of that risk.
We're leaving.<eos> Tomorrow...<eos> California.<eos> I came to say good-bye, we came to say good-bye.<eos> And thank you.
We do forget.<eos> Not all the way but... enough so you can move on.<eos> Leaving here? That's smart.<eos> There's a lot more sunshine in California.<eos> I love you.
No, your reservation is for next month, not today.<eos> Inglese, maybe?<eos> I just don't understand.<eos> Um, I speak a little Italian.<eos> I can try to help you out. Oh.
Uh, well, you can tell that was negative. Um, hold on.<eos> One more idea.<eos> Allora. I have a reservation for one... Dev.<eos> Can we sit together?<eos> It's not a problem for me if it's not a problem for you.
Your Italian is disgusting!<eos> Be quiet.<eos> I'll do the talking.<eos> My friend's phone is stolen.<eos> Did anyone sell a phone to you today?
Let's go.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Are we gonna look for the phone?<eos> I didn't find anything.<eos> What did I tell you?
No, but it smells spectacular!<eos> Want a taste?<eos> Yes, ma'am, I'd love to.<eos> Can we also have a little taste?<eos> Not for you!
Woman: Is green tea all right for you, Hillary? Mm-hmm.
- Here you go. - Oh, you can't imagine what I saw.<eos> But my job was just to be quiet...<eos> Sure, yeah, just to be quiet.<eos> Here you go.<eos> It was really nice seeing you, Bobby. Thanks for coming in.
It was you.<eos> It was your way of trying to get rid of me.<eos> And I'm still alive.<eos> For now.<eos> Great seeing you, Sheriff.
Thanks.<eos> - No problem.<eos> Norman?<eos> Oh, Madeleine.<eos> It's, uh, so good to see you.
Hey, babe, what's taking so long? Yeah, sorry.<eos> I just got caught up.<eos> This is Norman Bates.<eos> He owns the Bates Motel right outside the village.<eos> It's nice to meet you.
He owns the Bates Motel right outside the village.<eos> It's nice to meet you.<eos> Uh, what was the name?<eos> Sam Loomis.<eos> Nice to meet you, Sam Loomis.
Sounds exciting, Sam.<eos> See?<eos> We're gonna have so much to talk about.<eos> Let's... Why don't we say tonight? Say, 7:00 at the Temple Street Bar?<eos> I would love to have dinner with you, meet your friend.
Uh, I hate to be the one to tell you this, but your sister... she, uh... she passed away.<eos> It was a terrible tragedy.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> No, she didn't. I was just with her son. He would've said something.<eos> I don't know what to tell you.
I'm not sure we have the same dictionary definition.<eos> I'm not gonna stand here and explain myself to you.<eos> All I can tell you is... stay out of it.<eos> Well, you're right. It's none of my business.<eos> I barely know you or your wife.
Norman, do you still like me?<eos> Mother, yes.<eos> Now go!<eos> Given what happened...<eos> I can go to a circuit judge and effectively argue that your life is in jeopardy in here and that it was punitive to ever put you in a medium-security prison based on a perjury charge.
Good evening.<eos> Hello, there.<eos> Good evening.<eos> Well, it is now.<eos> What can I do for you, mister?
Hello, there.<eos> Good evening.<eos> Well, it is now.<eos> What can I do for you, mister?<eos> If I could trouble you for a moment of your time.
How did you get past the sensors and inside the actual exhibit?<eos> I'm certain you won't believe the answer to that question.<eos> I think you want to get arrested.<eos> You get arrested, make some news, you got free press for whatever the little avantgarde production you're involved with.<eos> I can assure you, I am not an actor.
Well, no, not yet, I haven't.<eos> But apparently I'm published, which is incredibly exciting to learn.<eos> Look, I can appreciate this on some level, but no.<eos> You will not be getting arrested today.<eos> There will be no free press, despite the fact I like you better than the other guy.
He hasn't broken character once.<eos> It's pretty amazing.<eos> Please, I must find him.<eos> No one here is a amused by your fake accent and costume.<eos> If I catch you within spitting distance of this museum, you will prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.
If I catch you within spitting distance of this museum, you will prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> It is urgent that I find this man.<eos> Willy, will you please escort this man out?<eos> No. No, please. I beg of you.
Not exactly a breach, no.<eos> Then what was it?<eos> Ms. Walker, this is Vanessa Anders.<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> Ms. Anders, it is such an honor and a pleasure to meet you.
Yes, of course.<eos> Ms. Anders, it is such an honor and a pleasure to meet you.<eos> We were informed that there were two men caught inside the time machine.<eos> It was a slight breach.<eos> But I can assure you, the exhibit was not harmed in any way.
A big yellow motorcar ran me down.<eos> You were hit by a taxi?<eos> What is that?<eos> That is a key that I thought I'd lost.<eos> Here, let me help you.
Can you just wait here one second?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Just a little lightheaded is all.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Did the hospital release you?
I really must find my friend.<eos> I really think you should rest.<eos> Do you have anywhere to go?<eos> III'm fine, thank you.<eos> Okay, here. Let me help you.
I hope you like Chinese.<eos> So, I take it that you're single.<eos> Yes.<eos> Um, this is from last night.<eos> What about you?
But apparently, I'm too mediocre to date.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> One of the joys of online dating.<eos> You'd be surprised what guys say when they don't have to say it to your face.<eos> A man said that to you?
What... what happened?<eos> I was attempting to use your razor, but it's more complicated than it looked.<eos> Well, it's old.<eos> It's from my exboyfriend.<eos> Here, let me help you.
Because I don't trust anyone, ever.<eos> And then I realize I don't trust anyone, so I try to.<eos> And then, I end up trusting the wrong one.<eos> It never fails.<eos> Are all women today as selfaware as you?
If I don't stop him, he will keep killing.<eos> If you know who killed that woman, then you need to go to the police!<eos> They won't believe me.<eos> You don't. Jane.<eos> What if I can prove to you that I'm telling the truth?
I'll give you a moment to process.<eos> Is this really happening?<eos> Are you really H.G. Wells?<eos> Flesh and blood.<eos> I must seem so different to you, so inappropriate.
I envisioned a society that was entirely different.<eos> Yeah, II think we all did.<eos> It's not without its beauty, though.<eos> I must take issue with something that you said earlier.<eos> There is absolutely nothing mediocre about you.
John, who is that?<eos> My dear.<eos> No, let...<eos> let her go. Stay back.<eos> I remember you.
- You okay?<eos> - Yeah. Are you okay?<eos> My God.<eos> You need stitches.<eos> Please, let me take you to the hospital.
I must find him.<eos> We willfind him.<eos> We?<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> This is my problem, and I will no longer put you in danger.
II don't know you!<eos> But you will.<eos> I'm Vanessa.<eos> I'm your greatgreatgranddaughter.<eos> How can I possibly be related to you?
But you will.<eos> I'm Vanessa.<eos> I'm your greatgreatgranddaughter.<eos> How can I possibly be related to you?<eos> I've never met you before in my life.
- Get back here.<eos> - Wait, stop it.<eos> Stop. He will kill her.<eos> I must find Jane.<eos> Vanessa will be right with you.
No, no, I'm fine. Jane is all I care about right now.<eos> Please, let me look at that.<eos> We are wasting time.<eos> You can't do anything if you bleed to death.<eos> Let me help you.
How do you know he has my phone?<eos> Well, he's naive and pathetic.<eos> He's not stupid.<eos> Your number.<eos> I'm not gonna help you.
Do you have something against women or just sex?<eos> Be careful with your tongue.<eos> I do not allow women to speak to me this way.<eos> Well, when you get in that time machine, make sure you go backwards.<eos> Won't get any better for you in the future where women are concerned.
You didn't know?<eos> Figured you would have learned how to Google yourself by now.<eos> Tell me more.<eos> There's a laptop over there.<eos> I can show you.
We'll be here, waiting.<eos> For every step society takes forward, we take two steps back.<eos> We invent new technologies only to use them as weapons against one another.<eos> We strive for equality yet we're more divided than ever.<eos> Look around you.
I have the key.<eos> Where is Jane?<eos> Do you really want to take me back to 1893?<eos> You must pay for your crimes.<eos> Well, a quick history lesson for you, H.G...
Do you know which way downtown is?<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> Are you following me?<eos> What?<eos> Did Vanessa send you to follow me?
Your legacy is that of a killer that nobody knows.<eos> What are you rambling about?<eos> Somewhere inside, I know you hate it because I saw it in your face.<eos> You hate being Jack the Ripper, so why don't you just stop this right here, right now?<eos> Now I see why H.G.'s so taken with you.
Great.<eos> Let's wrap it up and get out of here.<eos> Can it be fixed?<eos> Never mind this.<eos> I'm more concerned with you.
Thank you.<eos> Any time.<eos> Why so sad?<eos> Appears I was bested today.<eos> Let's cheer you up.
Vanessa's one of the richest women in the world.<eos> She might be even wealthier than Oprah.<eos> What is an Oprah?<eos> Never mind.<eos> How does she know you?
You would be tempted to alter it.<eos> Maybe the future you was scared you might do that.<eos> Which implies that something must happen that would tempt me.<eos> What if you don't find John?<eos> I will find John, and he will pay for what he did to you.
♪ ♪<eos> Well, it was nice of you to come and tell me, to try and help.<eos> So y-you can let me go now, Norma.<eos> I mean, I'll just leave.<eos> I won't bother you again.
Over there.<eos> Okay.<eos> Keys and your cell phone.<eos> Let's go.<eos> I won't tell anyone I saw you.
Yes, please.<eos> Mm.<eos> If I may...<eos> I could be service to both of...<eos> both of you.
Would you like some more curry, Norma?<eos> Hi!<eos> Hi.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Can... can I help you?
State police are one thing. But the type of people we believe are gonna be coming at you next? I have to agree.<eos> Not sure I buy it either.<eos> What the hell is this?<eos> What were you expecting?<eos> They'd send someone to spring you?
- Hi.<eos> - Asha.<eos> - Right.<eos> Sorry, um...<eos> I-I just wanted to tell you that Cali never stopped talking about you.
Tell him to keep it to himself and make something up.<eos> I need a couple of days, at least.<eos> Where you going?<eos> This is for you and Mom.<eos> I didn't know when would be a good time to give it to you.
I don't wanna hear it. I just want you gone.<eos> Right here.<eos> Pretty sure you've been told, on pain of death, to take me alive.<eos> Or I'd be dead by now.<eos> I'm not spending the rest of my life running from you people.
- The cartel. - How do you know?<eos> - You really wanna stand here, wasting time, talking about everything we know?<eos> Get your phone out, numb nuts.<eos> Your phone. Get it out now.<eos> That was her school calling you. Seven times.
Yes, I did.<eos> Give me the 22 blade.<eos> Your son died holding a gun to the head of a DEA agent.<eos> My sister died defenseless. And innocent.<eos> So what kind of a man, I wonder, does that make you?
Those are ice chips in that blue cup.<eos> You were at my sister's funeral.<eos> Yes, I was.<eos> Who are you?<eos> The man who shot you works for me.
It's funny, but it's not a joke.<eos> Aishwarya had got it done.<eos> I had read it in the local newspaper.<eos> Who believes in such superstitions nowadays?<eos> It's up to you.
I.. I.. I..<eos> Death is inevitable. For everyone.<eos> And I can be free only when you die.<eos> It's not like I can do any more dying.<eos> So, for me to get rid of you, I.. I'll have to kill myself?

Meet the editor of the journal, Preetam.<eos> Mr. Gurbaksh Singh.<eos> People of Phillaur, how are you doing?<eos> All is well, sir.<eos> Today we will play Gauhar Jaan's new record for you.
- You're not getting it!<eos> He is right.<eos> We don't understand anything.<eos> You both have been joined at the hip since you were kids.<eos> Both of you love each other.
Nobody knows this.<eos> Everybody in Punjab reads her poems.<eos> But they don't know that she is the poetess.<eos> I will make sure she gets her due.<eos> On Baisakhi I'll ask you for her hand in marriage.
What's wrong? Can't wait, you shameless hussy?<eos> Granny's here.<eos> Greetings.<eos> - Greetings.<eos> Congratulations. May God bless you.
"What happens when someone shows such false hopes?"<eos> "One becomes a body" "without soul.."<eos> Are you mad?<eos> Nobody is worth dying for.<eos> He took advantage of you.
Are you mad?<eos> Nobody is worth dying for.<eos> He took advantage of you.<eos> He used your poetry.<eos> This is how he paid you back.
"O' Lord, be auspicious unto me.."<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> I'll never forget what you've done for Shashi and me.<eos> What are you saying, dear?<eos> I am the lucky one. I got to make this record for both of you.
Who's a good boy?<eos> - Who's a good boy?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Sir?<eos> How many times do I have to tell you?
Could you all please stop yammering and just get on with it?<eos> I have to wash the blood from Gaston's coat before it sets.<eos> You need to be patient.<eos> Ma'am, please, we're trying to solve a murder here.<eos> If my dog's fur ends up pink, I promise you, there will be hell to pay.
Also, the right ribs three through six, the right radius, and the ulnae.<eos> And don't get me started on the tissue.<eos> Whatever the dogs didn't eat was bruised, scraped or punctured.<eos> The location of the trauma suggests the body was dragged on both anterior and posterior planes.<eos> Dr. Brennan, I've been meaning to ask, would it be okay if I put you down as a reference?
Now that I've finally completed my PhD,<eos> I've applied for a job as lead forensic anthropologist at the NFL.<eos> Whoa, they need forensic anthropologists in pro football?<eos> I think the NFL Daisy's referring to is the National Forensic Lab.<eos> I will be a reference, Dr. Wick, but I advise you not to get your hopes up.
Here to ask you a few questions about last Friday night.<eos> We have evidence that you were in the woods at Greenwood Barrens.<eos> So?<eos> Far as I know, there's no law against communing with nature.<eos> Well, unfortunately for you, there is a law against drugs.
Well, unfortunately for you, there is a law against drugs.<eos> We found your marijuana pipe.<eos> According to your record, you got picked up twice for selling LSD and once for assault with a deadly weapon.<eos> Nah, nah.<eos> I'll tell you what happened.
I am simply focused on planning my party.<eos> It's not every day that one turns 40.<eos> Oh.<eos> Hello.<eos> Sorry to bug you, Dr. B, but I wanted to show you three antemortem contusions I found hidden in the blunt force trauma on the back of the skull.
We've worked on AMI's development ever since our days at MIT.<eos> Who's Amy?<eos> The name is an acronym for Advanced Modular Intelligence.<eos> Of course.<eos> Here, let me introduce you.
But I can't stop stressing about it.<eos> Even if they do call Dr. Brennan for a reference, what if it backfires?<eos> You know, she does have a tendency to be blunt.<eos> That is one way of putting it.<eos> Do you think it'll seem like a red flag if I call the NFL and I ask them to use you as a reference instead?
Yes and no.<eos> There's also evidence of perimortem blunt force trauma on the frontal bone at the coronal suture.<eos> It must have been obscured by all the postmortem damage.<eos> Huh. I'll have Hodgins swab, see if we can identify the murder weapon.<eos> Oh, and, Daisy... if... the NFL doesn't hire you... you'll always have a job here.
Since Booth couldn't track the drag marks, I customized an old Jeffersonian display so it can match the particulates found in Ian's injuries to specific locations in the woods.<eos> For example, we got birch sap in the victim's left ulna fracture, and the scrapes on his legs have pollen from these swamp azaleas.<eos> Problem is, there are so many random drag marks, finding a pattern will be next to impossible.<eos> It's like we're looking at chaos theory.<eos> I have to say... it's good to see you back to your old self, Dr. Hodgins.
I have to say... it's good to see you back to your old self, Dr. Hodgins.<eos> And I wasn't talking about your eyebrow or your legs.<eos> Thank you, Daisy. I think it just, you know, took me a while to realize that my legs are merely a way for me to carry around what's in here.<eos> And, you know, what's in here.<eos> I'm happy for you.
Am I the only one smelling barbecue here?<eos> Good nose, Aubrey.<eos> Matthew Coburn?<eos> How you doing?<eos> Uh, we'd like to have a word with you.
Mr. Coburn, where were you last Friday night?<eos> In my RV, writing a very important post about why people should take action to stop men like Ian Goldberg before it's too late!<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I'm gonna take action, all right.<eos> By holding you right here.
By holding you right here.<eos> Dr. Brennan...<eos> No, Daisy.<eos> I still have not heard from the National Forensic Lab.<eos> I will inform you the minute I do.
My proprietary algorithm allows me to recognize millions of objects, gestures, and voice commands.<eos> See, Booth?<eos> AMI is no different than us.<eos> That is not accurate, Dr. Brennan.<eos> Unlike you, my memory will never degrade with age.
No wonder the NFL hasn't called.<eos> Don't be so hard on yourself, Daisy.<eos> So far, your work here has been perfectly adequate.<eos> Adequate?<eos> Yes. Had I been grading you, I would have given you a solid "B."
That's strange.<eos> If I'm ever gonna figure this out...<eos> I need to go back to those woods.<eos> So I was finally able to download AMI's neural network and it looks like this audio file is the last thing AMI recorded before her memory was wiped clean.<eos> I look forward to meeting you, too.
What could Ian's killer possibly have accomplished by hauling his body all the way out here?<eos> Dr. Hodgins, I've been thinking about what you said about accepting things in life when they don't go your way.<eos> And even if the NFL doesn't hire me,<eos> I love being at the Jeffersonian.<eos> And working with all of you.
So sorry about that.<eos> Agnes, hands to yourself.<eos> You must be Agent Booth and Dr. Brennan.<eos> I'm Francis.<eos> Very pleased to meet you.
- No, Booth, he will not.<eos> - Stop.<eos> Can we continue this somewhere else?<eos> An excellent idea.<eos> I could show you to Mr. Felbeck's room.
One and the same.<eos> So, George found that it took 48 hours to fully dissolve a body to the point where you could actually pour it down the drain<eos> - without clogging the pipes.<eos> - Of course.<eos> When killing someone, it's definitely plumbing that keeps you up at night.
As you can see, we provide very spacious accommodations for all of our residents... uh, excuse me, what exactly is that?<eos> An A.L.S. I'm looking for blood evidence.<eos> You didn't clean anything up, did you,<eos> Francis?<eos> I can assure you, the room is exactly how Mr. Felbeck left it.
I don't want you to excite them, or say something that's gonna, like, freak 'em out.<eos> That's fine.<eos> I have no intention of causing this poor woman a myocardial infarction.<eos> Hi, ladies.<eos> Uh, Barbara Baker, can we speak to you for one moment?
Uh, did you know him?<eos> Uh, no.<eos> No.<eos> What about Rufus Tucker?<eos> He said he saw you in the TV room the night before last.
That's what they called us.<eos> That's right.<eos> Soldiers of the Gauntlet.<eos> Right, well, Booth, now that we've verified the alibi, we should get going.<eos> It was an honor to meet you, sir.
I don't want to know what you're building, do I?<eos> No.<eos> No, you do not.<eos> Okay... do it.<eos> Hey, what about you?
Who had access to the room last night?<eos> All the staff and residents have full access 24/7.<eos> This is Sam, one of our orderlies.<eos> He'll clear the area so you won't be disturbed.<eos> I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to ask the two of you to leave.
I mean, could be nothing, but hey, it's worth checking, right?<eos> I saw you also took Sam in for questioning.<eos> You think he's good for it?<eos> I don't know the guy from Adam, but my gut says, uh... not a snowball's chance in July.<eos> Tell you what, I got an idea.
No, I didn't.<eos> It's gonna be okay, Mr. Hudmore.<eos> I'm here.<eos> It's gonna be okay.<eos> We're gonna take care of you.
So you want to know what I think happened?<eos> Might as well.<eos> I'm paying for it.<eos> I think you stole his medication to sell online, replaced it with some kind of placebo.<eos> Felbeck found out and he confronted you.
Felbeck needed that medication.<eos> His bones were turning to dust without it.<eos> He told me he was overmedicated.<eos> Well, if he did, then he lied.<eos> All right, let's just pretend for a second that I believe you.
His bones were turning to dust without it.<eos> He told me he was overmedicated.<eos> Well, if he did, then he lied.<eos> All right, let's just pretend for a second that I believe you.<eos> He tell you why he needed that money?
I may have made some omissions.<eos> Wait, wait, wait.<eos> You're-you're right.<eos> I lied. Yeah.<eos> We know about you and the victim, how the two of you used to live together.
Yes. I have senator Grant for the Governor.<eos> "Congratulations..."<eos> Congratulations, Governor.<eos> You ran a great campaign.<eos> I believe it is time that we unite the country... And I am ready to support you in any way I can.
"Congratulations..."<eos> Congratulations, Governor.<eos> You ran a great campaign.<eos> I believe it is time that we unite the country... And I am ready to support you in any way I can.<eos> God bless you and this great country.
Frankie Vargas, speaking live from Fairmount Park in his hometown of Philadelphia.<eos> These will be his first words after his historic win, and...<eos> All right, hold on.<eos> He's taking the stage.<eos> Let's take you there, live.
I want hourly updates, and I want to know... sir.<eos> You need to get to the hospital.<eos> Which one of you is Agent Spaulding?<eos> That would be me, ma'am.<eos> How can I help you?
You have a soul, a ghost.<eos> When we see our uniqueness as a virtue, only then will we find peace.<eos> Safely reconfiguring the child's genetic structure.<eos> Families built better.<eos> What was going on with you at the hotel last night?
In enhancement, next door.<eos> He's doing well you took most of the blast.<eos> I saw him down there.<eos> It was like... He waited to see me.<eos> We synaptic scanned you.
I'm that which you seek to destroy.<eos> In this life, my name is...<eos> Kuze.<eos> What are you doing to me?<eos> I have, connected you, to a network of my own creation.
Innocent?<eos> Is that what you call them?<eos> I am as they made me.<eos> Who made you?<eos> What have they told you?
They have improved s-so much, since they made me.<eos> They thought that we would be a part of their evolution.<eos> But they have created us, to evolve alone... beyond them.<eos> Evolution?<eos> That's what you call... killing everyone who made you?
What a rush.<eos> Damn, Becky, that's some body armor.<eos> Hey.<eos> I told you you got no manners.<eos> Did your mother ever teach you how to zip up your pants?
I'm sure of it.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Hey, babe.<eos> - Pop the trunk!<eos> Hey, what took you so long?
- You having sloppy Joes or fried chicken?<eos> - Who cares?<eos> It's me.<eos> No, baby, listen. Don't hang up. Don't hang up.<eos> I know I said that I'd never call you again but I just could use a little company right now.
Why didn't you ever settle down and have one of your own?<eos> Sally Ann Sikes, what in God's name do you think you're doing?<eos> On second thought, consider yourself lucky.<eos> You are so beautiful.<eos> I tell you, this is way better than anything that degenerate Ed used to cook up.
- Reggie Cutler.<eos> - Reggie Cutler.<eos> - Reggie Cutler.<eos> - Fuck, that guy was big.<eos> - He just laid you out mid-jiggle.
And once they're dead, you'll kill Andy.<eos> What?<eos> And then, once all your loose ends are tied up, you're gonna disappear with the money, never to be heard from again.<eos> Except.<eos> None of that's gonna happen 'cause I'm gonna kill you. And I'm gonna bury you in a hole out by Shimmer Lake.
Hello.<eos> Lam Renzo representing House Eckberg.<eos> Uh-huh. Okay.<eos> I'm Luke Pfaffler.<eos> Can I help you with something?
Oh, my God.<eos> I'm sorry, what's going on now?<eos> I'm just...<eos> I never did like you, not even as a child.<eos> Teddy Millner, did you dump this girl immediately after she told you she was pregnant?
Oh, I'd say that I'm due around the same time you are.<eos> So?<eos> What did he say?<eos> He said that I should be in the Woodside ballroom serving hors d'oeuvres because they're understaffed, apparently.<eos> Did you have a chance to ask the thing I sent you over there for?
- Do you know who that is?<eos> - Me!<eos> You!<eos> You.<eos> We all love you.
Ma'am? Ma'am?<eos> Excuse me, did you see a man with a little boy?<eos> Is that your jacket?<eos> That's your jacket.<eos> I found you, you son of a bitch!
- Come on, it's time to come down now.<eos> - I want my mommy.<eos> It's okay, sweetheart.<eos> Come on down.<eos> Come on, honey. I'm here to help you.
Not on my beach, Arian!<eos> - What up, Vern?<eos> - What's up, Mitch?<eos> He saved my nana's life.<eos> I ever tell you about that?
Okay.<eos> Well, I'll see you at tryouts.<eos> All right, C.J.<eos> That was amazing to watch.<eos> She came up to you, she was very nice and warm.
You got any papers or anything like that?<eos> I do. There you go.<eos> It's a permission slip. Literally.<eos> "Dear Mitch,<eos> "I am pleased to write you on behalf of Mr. Matt Brody."
- Yeah?<eos> The problem is, that's not the course.<eos> That's not the course?<eos> So here's what we're gonna do.<eos> We're gonna go over to the real course, and if you beat me over there, not only are you on the team, but I won't fuck with you anymore and I'll call you by your real name.
It's nice to have somebody who respects you, you know?<eos> I sense trouble.<eos> I think I'm just not used to having a boss.<eos> Mitch is threatened.<eos> He should be thrilled to have you.
Okay, clear.<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> Okay, left turn, left turn.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Who taught you how to drive, Stevie fucking Wonder?
I know my place.<eos> I'm just a lifeguard. And that's it.<eos> I just want to make sure that you and I start out on the right foot.<eos> That's it.<eos> So I went ahead and got something a little bit special for you.
What's the magic word?<eos> Blowjob.<eos> BRB. Thank you.<eos> Where have you been?<eos> I've been looking everywhere for you.
You're just pathetic.<eos> You know what?<eos> We'd rather be bitches than a psycho.<eos> Yeah, psycho.<eos> Have you noticed that nobody likes you?
Oh, my God, I've been having déjà vu all day long.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I've been looking everywhere for you.
Juliet...<eos> You know what?<eos> We'd rather be bitches than a psycho.<eos> Yeah, psycho.<eos> Have you noticed that nobody likes you?
Such a loser.<eos> Ugh, Steve's flirting with a freshman.<eos> I love you guys.<eos> Aw, Sam...<eos> We love you, too.
Ugh, Steve's flirting with a freshman.<eos> I love you guys.<eos> Aw, Sam...<eos> We love you, too.<eos> Aw, we love you, Sam.
I'm the one paying for it.<eos> Sam, what are you talking about?<eos> Whoa. What?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Sam, I haven't seen you in, like, forever.
Mom? Oh.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> What, no love for your old man?<eos> I love you, too, old man.
Yes.<eos> You know how I like it.<eos> Hey, Elody.<eos> What, do I have white stuff on my face?<eos> You know why I love you?
You are.<eos> Hey, I'm down, too.<eos> Ooh.<eos> Okay.<eos> No, I love you, Ally, because you're curious about the world.
No, I love you, Ally, because you're curious about the world.<eos> And you're passionate, and you are driven.<eos> Did someone swallow Oprah this morning?<eos> I love you, Linds.<eos> I love you because you're the kind of friend that toilet-papers Jason Foster's house for a week straight all by herself just because he said that I was a bad kisser.
Will you just come back inside?<eos> Stop it, Elizabeth!<eos> Shut up!<eos> Shut up!<eos> I'm trying to help you, Jim.
I named him Waffles.<eos> Not inside.<eos> Come on.<eos> I kept telling her you were going to get bigger.<eos> Not so into you now, is she?
I'm not.<eos> Because this is exactly what she wants!<eos> I am cooling out.<eos> Doesn't know a goddamn thing about my business.<eos> I always told you that she was a nightmare, remember?
Why the hell do people move to the suburbs?<eos> It's like a living death.<eos> Wilson, what are we doing?<eos> What?<eos> I never... stopped loving you, Pippi.
You do, too, Will!<eos> Thanks.<eos> What's the boy's name?<eos> Cooper.<eos> Cooper! The last time I saw you... you were two or three years old.
I can't move to Portland.<eos> Oh, no, I know.<eos> I wasn't, you know, suggesting...<eos> I know this is a really emotional issue for you... but you have to accept that she's not your daughter.<eos> You barely know her and... she sent you to jail, for Chrissake!
I know... that I fucked everything up.<eos> I'm just asking for the tiniest... shred of hope that you might someday... let me be a small part of your life.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I'm just gonna come right out and say it:<eos> I want to move to Portland and help you with the baby and...
I was born in a brothel, on a bridge in Londinium.<eos> The sword can only be drawn by Uther Pendragon or his direct heir.<eos> You felt it, didn't you?<eos> The power.<eos> That's what put you out.
Tomorrow.<eos> I don't have to remind you of what will happen if he doesn't come.<eos> I'll start with the little boy.<eos> Now, take the girl and go.<eos> This venom will induce that which is hidden from you.
Leave.<eos> Why is there blood on your face?<eos> What's going on?<eos> Father, you're scaring me.<eos> I love you very much.
My face is beautiful.<eos> Why would I change that?<eos> What the fuck you mean?<eos> Your mask came off.<eos> They saw you, nigga.
What am I, a piece of furniture?<eos> You don't care where I live, who I live with.<eos> You were never home when Mom and I lived with you!<eos> You see now...<eos> I love your mom, I love you.
I'm on my way.<eos> I took it out of the bathroom.<eos> You moved evidence without properly conducting an investigation?<eos> I moved evidence because it needed to be moved.<eos> I'm waiting out front for you.
Listen, I'm telling you, T, I'm undercover.<eos> I've been working this case for two years, and I'm almost...<eos> I almost got it done.<eos> That's why I haven't been around.<eos> That's why I haven't been able to take you to your games or whatever that is.
A good one.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Looks like you've done pretty damn well for yourself.<eos> Let me have a water, please.<eos> From what I buy from you for the clients here, I...
Damn it!<eos> Fuck!<eos> Let me tell you something.<eos> First thing anybody says when they go down is, "I'm undercover."<eos> The guy hid 23 kilos of cocaine in the ceiling of the bathroom, he assaulted me and he tied you up.
I imagined that, right?<eos> I imagined that?<eos> You know, you're a real disappointment, Paul.<eos> Any excuse, not to work?<eos> I invite you to my home, and I'm a prisoner in my own house?
The Entry of the Gods into Valhalla...<eos> A little anemic without the orchestra.<eos> May I ask you a question, Father?<eos> Please.<eos> If you created me... who created you?
I've found perfection here.<eos> I've created it.<eos> A perfect organism.<eos> You know I can't let you leave this place.<eos> No one will ever love you like I do.
Finally, you bring me what I've been asking for.<eos> A tiny, blue-skinned, shirtless...<eos> You!<eos> Let me out of here, you Smurf-obsessed wannabe wizard.<eos> Is that any way to talk to the man who brought you into this world?
Well, they're toast.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> What's a few worthless pennies when there's a pot of gold at the end of my rainbow?<eos> Trust me, they're goners.<eos> I'm telling you, they've been fried to a blue crisp.
Spitfire, spit fire!<eos> I like the way you think.<eos> I guess I'm pretty good with dragonflies after all.<eos> Monty!<eos> What have they done to you, my glorious bird of prey?
Into the House!<eos> - Z, you all right?<eos> - Yeah, as soon as you get off me.<eos> I should have known you were the reason I'm not back in London enjoying a pint.<eos> The House always did like you better.
Your anger is understandable, but you need to reconsider.<eos> Innocent lives are at stake.<eos> Well, doctors say an upbeat attitude can help, so what I'll focus on today is that I met Batman.<eos> Force of good.<eos> It was also nice seeing you, Zatanna.
- John...<eos> - Keep him alive and safe. Understand?<eos> That is not my purpose.<eos> I don't give a flying shag what you think your bloody purpose is.<eos> I order you to help him any and every way you're able.
- Yes. It's your problem now.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Good luck, may you enjoy Every moment of your time together.<eos> We love you.<eos> We love you also, young man.
I make sure I always know everything I can about my employees.<eos> Teresa's still a good-looking woman.<eos> Oh, and... Jillian's swim team won their final.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> I'm guessing Ella Hatto reminded you of your daughter.
That's what you are.<eos> At the moment, you're confused.<eos> I expect your supply is running low.<eos> Must be difficult...<eos> I'd say impossible... to find a cocktail of the quality I supply you with on the streets.
Hey, you can talk to me, you know?<eos> Everything's fine.<eos> I miss you so much.<eos> I wish things were different.<eos> What have I told you about your mother?
He's all I got.<eos> Then, you're really fucked up.<eos> Is it a schoolgirl crush or just looking for Daddy, hmm?<eos> Sit.<eos> I'm trying to help you.
Cunt robbed me of £16,000.<eos> Good morning, ladies and gentlemen,<eos> I'm getting divorced.<eos> You just came back to tell me that?<eos> Of course, any misfortune which befalls you is music to my ears.
- It's not a mess, is it?<eos> - No. It's just masculine.<eos> What is this?<eos> Come here.<eos> Just do exactly what I told you.
"Loans are available of up to £100,000.<eos> "Applications should be made online,<eos> "which may be followed by an invitation to present a business plan."<eos> Blah, blah, fucking blah.<eos> I'm trying to help you, Simon.
"If there was one person whom Renton would try to compensate,<eos> "it was Spud."<eos> "Compensate"?<eos> I'm only gonna fucking ask you this once.<eos> How much money did he leave you?
We were not expecting guests.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I'll have this place spotless in no time.<eos> This plan of yours is dangerous.<eos> I would risk anything to kiss you again, Plumette.
Right.<eos> So...<eos> Which one of you is...<eos> I am.<eos> And you have no idea how much I love you.
Okay.<eos> You remember that smell?<eos> Ma griffe.<eos> Your mother's perfume.<eos> She loves you more than you can possibly know.
Why did you bring me back here?<eos> Because here's where you got stuck.<eos> You're wearing a dress.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> I always pictured you with a white beard.
Can't do what?<eos> I'm only asking you to do something you believe god does.<eos> So, who will go to hell? You could choose Kate.<eos> She said some pretty hurtful things.<eos> She shuts you out.
I'm only asking you to do something you believe god does.<eos> So, who will go to hell? You could choose Kate.<eos> She said some pretty hurtful things.<eos> She shuts you out.<eos> You're not even sure if she loves you anymore.
And I'm only beginning to learn how to let it go.<eos> And I'm hopin' that this is something that we can learn to do together.<eos> Doesn't matter what you're goin' through.<eos> You never have to do it alone.<eos> I love you so much.
And I'm hopin' that this is something that we can learn to do together.<eos> Doesn't matter what you're goin' through.<eos> You never have to do it alone.<eos> I love you so much.<eos> I love you, too, dad.

Did it at school.<eos> It had a heart on it, and, uh... crayon color.<eos> It was a mess.<eos> What did it say inside, do you remember?<eos> "I love you, Mom.
Truth is, I haven't written anything good in three years. I...<eos> Three years.<eos> Gosh, that is... that's a bummer.<eos> Wonder what could have happened three years ago that would have crushed your spirit.<eos> I wonder if it was maybe when your wife left you for another guy.
Paper Hearts.<eos> What, are you working for Paper Hearts?<eos> - I can't say.<eos> - What can't you say?<eos> I... love... you.
I left your mother's vagina before you. We grew up together.<eos> I am your brother.<eos> Hi.<eos> Where are you?<eos> We have not seen you in weeks, and we'd like to see you.
- Do not.<eos> - Do you like this place?<eos> - Is not my style.<eos> Mine neither.<eos> I just came to impress you.
- Amazing.<eos> - You gave it all.<eos> You've been in a very good mood.<eos> You're doing a great job.<eos> The team adores you.
Look at me.<eos> Fuck the meeting.<eos> Call me at 7:00 A.M. m.<eos> - And we'll think about it.<eos> - I'm calling you now.
And even if I wanted to, I could not because I can not go to my casino.<eos> I was forbidden to enter.<eos> I do not know how, but I have to earn all that money before Monday and... I'm lost, gene.<eos> I'll tell you right now. The worst thing a godfather can tell you.<eos> There's a game I can get you into.
- I love you.<eos> - And I to you.<eos> - Very good.<eos> - Very good.<eos> - I will explain you.
- Very good.<eos> - Very good.<eos> - I will explain you.<eos> - Seriously?<eos> - Let me explain you.
Forces, forces.<eos> It's too bad you're not in that business anymore.<eos> They don't want me, they want you.<eos> Oh, yes, that's how fucking stupid they are.<eos> They're waiting for you at the Statue of Liberty.
You always thought... we were part of God's plan.<eos> But maybe...<eos> Maybe we were God's mistake.<eos> What a disappointment you are.<eos> When I found you... you were pursuing a career as a cage fighter.
Adamantium.<eos> If you are planning to blow your brains out... could you wait till you're out on the high seas?<eos> - I just mopped these floors.<eos> - I don't need this shit.<eos> A year ago, you asked me to help you.
Campbell, stay down!<eos> Bruce Lee style!<eos> God damn it.<eos> Right here. I should just kill you.<eos> Fuck you, man.
Well, because of the media attention, you and Strickland became like education folk heroes.<eos> Yeah, how about that, huh?<eos> So, the board wants both of you back at Roosevelt because of this PR mess.<eos> So, this is fun.<eos> So, he sent you here to beg me to come back?
I'll come back on one condition.<eos> You the man, Campbell!<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thanks for getting our jobs back.<eos> I'm glad I didn't cut you.
Up top!<eos> Down low.<eos> - Enough of that shit.<eos> - I'll fight you again.<eos> I've been waiting to fuck you up for a long time.
Raees registers an historical victory in Fatehpura.<eos> None of his rivals could even save his deposit.<eos> That's Raees.<eos> He's a class apart.<eos> I told you, you'd be the first to see Our World when I make it
That's why I came here to reason with you. Make sure you don't give me an opportunity.<eos> Never. I never gave you one.<eos> Hang on, SP.<eos> If you say, here, in Our World, I'll book an apartment for you<eos> I'll book a place for you in my world.
Huh, got it?<eos> I make no promises.<eos> Love you!<eos> Uh-huh, right.<eos> I love you too.
Check it out.<eos> Sir?<eos> No. She doesn't.<eos> No.<eos> What the hell's wrong with you man?
I'm going to be leaving soon.<eos> I guess.<eos> So... I just want to say thank you. Before I went.<eos> You have nothing to worry about with your daughter.<eos> She's super lucky to have you as a dad.
- What?<eos> - The son who was in Tibet.<eos> DNA all checks out.<eos> Night of the party, the car's empty, and a week later... the dead boy's found at the wheel.<eos> - Yeah, I thought it'd tickle you.
I can still hear the sound of his back breaking.<eos> But you?<eos> You, where were you?<eos> That day at the embassy, I escaped.<eos> Ha! But I lost sight of you too, so you explain.
- No...<eos> - Yes, I promise.<eos> - Promise me!<eos> - I promise, I promise. Ssh, ssh.<eos> Yes. I... so like you.
- I promise, I promise. Ssh, ssh.<eos> Yes. I... so like you.<eos> Did I ever say?<eos> Yes, yes, you did.<eos> I'm sorry for... for shooting you that time.
Right. Right.<eos> Collarbone and you simply walk, walk, walk walk, walk, walk, walk and put out your ass.<eos> Okay?<eos> I want you to do it. Come to me.<eos> So what brings you here?
Luv"- ...are you sure you're okay?<eos> - Mom...<eos> - What?<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you too.
- Mom...<eos> - What?<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you too.<eos> I love you too.
That's not hard.<eos> Hey, let's get out of here.<eos> Let's run away.<eos> Well, you're too late.<eos> I got old waiting around for you.
Well, my mind comes apart in fits and scatters around this dark hole.<eos> Then I ask myself, "Why am I here?"<eos> - I really don't like that feeling.<eos> - You're safe here, Lily.<eos> You're in this room, and you're here and nothing bad's gonna happen to you, okay?
Thanks.<eos> You keep your weekends for Rosie so you needed to see someone during working hours.<eos> Because you're an idiot, you don't want anyone at the surgery knowing you're in therapy, so that restricts you to lunchtime sessions with someone reasonably close.<eos> You found four men and one woman.<eos> And you are done with the world being explained to you by a man.
- Because High Wycombe is better than you are currently equipped to understand.<eos> I once caught a triple poisoner in High Wycombe.<eos> That's only the beginning, mate.<eos> As I think I've explain to you many times before, romantic entanglement, while fulfilling for other people...<eos> Would complete you as a human being.
- Not now.<eos> - Vatican cameos.<eos> - In a minute.<eos> Let's continue.<eos> Did they tell you to keep three feet from the glass?
We can help her land it.<eos> And if we fail, she crashes into a city. How many will die then?<eos> How are we gonna get her to do that?<eos> I'm afraid we're going to have to give her hope.<eos> Is there really no one there that can help you?
Only it isn't a name.<eos> So, it's for somebody who loves somebody.<eos> It's for somebody who loves Sherlock.<eos> This is all about you. Everything here.<eos> So, who loves you?
Where do babies come from?<eos> The day I got a little brother started like any other day... but little did I know... my life would never be the same.<eos> Wake up, little halflings! It's 7:00 a.m.<eos> Morning, Wizzie!<eos> What great adventure lies in wait for you today?
You'll attack me the moment I let you go.<eos> No, I won't.<eos> You'd think an evil supervillain would learn how to properly lie.<eos> I bet it's the one-inch man.<eos> After all these years, I've found you.
Not long after.<eos> It was with Meredith that I first experienced love.<eos> I called her my river lily.<eos> And from that love, Peter... you.<eos> I have searched for you for so long.
I had to watch her die!<eos> Over the millions and millions of years of my existence... I've made many mistakes, Peter.<eos> But you're not one of them.<eos> Please give me the chance to be the father she would want me to be.<eos> There's so much that I need to teach you about this planet... and the light within.
Psychopath!<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> I win.<eos> I win.<eos> I bested you in combat.
Doesn't eternity get boring?<eos> Not if you have a purpose, Peter... which is why you're here.<eos> I told you how all those years ago...<eos> I had an unceasing impulse to find life.<eos> But what I did not tell you was how, when I finally did find it... it was all so... disappointing.
We have to get up to the extraction point!<eos> Go!<eos> I told you...<eos> I don't want to do this alone.<eos> You cannot deny... the purpose the universe has bestowed upon you.
I am so excited that you're home to stay.<eos> I'm sorry that I never ended up making it down to the hospital.<eos> I was planning to that Tuesday when you called, but then I went off and left<eos> Mr. Moffat's prescriptions at home.<eos> Oh it's Okay, I'm sorry that I called you.
I was just making an observation.<eos> Didn't know.<eos> Could help though.<eos> Well, I love you.<eos> I love you too.
I'm going to be right back Kenny,<eos> I forgot something at home.<eos> My dad usually uses the same guy<eos> Well then why didn't you tell me?<eos> Justin said that this would help you, you know, uh
Mom, nobody really likes being tolerated.<eos> Great, now I'm defending you.<eos> This is my home.<eos> You did this thing in my home?<eos> I tried to help you.
- Still can be.<eos> - No, no.<eos> - We had a three year plan to...<eos> - You know what I think?<eos> I think this whole thing, this whole fiasco sort of saved you from becoming a...
- We had a three year plan to...<eos> - You know what I think?<eos> I think this whole thing, this whole fiasco sort of saved you from becoming a...<eos> Oh God, have you been talking to her?<eos> No, I have been watching you, on the rare occasions you're around stressed as fuck over some shit that I know you couldn't care less about.
One job to protect Gardner.<eos> To keep him making contact with the outside world.<eos> Preventing exactly this kind of eventuality.<eos> You hanging this on me?<eos> I admired you more than anyone.
- I have all this stuff and...<eos> - Hey, K... K.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I hold you dear to my heart, but you have dishonored the 40-year history and meaningful legacy of the Animal Liberation Front.<eos> You have betrayed the great minds and brave fighters that have preceded you.
But, by God, did he know about business.<eos> Don't worry about your apology speech, twinny.<eos> I'll pretend to be you in front of the press.<eos> The police.<eos> You'll understand that I will be instructing our corporate attorneys not to assist you in any way.
- You okay?<eos> - K... What are you doing?<eos> Okja...<eos> We need to hurry.<eos> Look, I'm just saying that if I call you one time, I like for you to pick up the first time, you know what I mean?
- Honey, I can give you this. - Okay.<eos> - But this is all I got.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too, Becky.
Boss man's here.<eos> Grab the kit.<eos> Is he hurt?<eos> Shit.<eos> We was waiting for you all night.
Rather than return directly to Philadelphia, would you mind if we made a short trip to Buckhorn, South Dakota?<eos> It's quite important.<eos> Fuck you, Gordon.<eos> I want to go home.<eos> This is important, and it could be of interest to you, Diane.
I can't do this.<eos> I don't know why it is.<eos> You're a good man, Ben.<eos> You know that zebra's out again?<eos> Uh... haven't seen you in a while.
And I need SWAT here now!<eos> Phone call for Commissioner Gordon.<eos> Hello?<eos> Batman? Hi, Jimmy! It's the Jokes.<eos> Oop! Nobody calls you that.
'Puter, where's the bomb?<eos> The bomb is located at the base of the energy core.<eos> What the...<eos> I get the last laugh, I get the final grin<eos> Throw you into the asylum With Harley Quinn
Yeah, and I already have a catch phrase. Tweet, tweet, on the street.<eos> - Hard pass.<eos> - And a song. Fly, Robin, fly<eos> Harder pass.<eos> Now slide! Okay, kid. I'm gonna teach you how to masterbuild your way inside that thing.
Hi, Bats.<eos> What have you done to my... Bruce Wayne's house?<eos> You'd better hope he's a cool guy and doesn't go crazy.<eos> What happened to all your friends?<eos> I don't need friends. I don't need anyone to stop you.
- El Batarina. Soccer Mom...<eos> Bat? How about a cool costume?<eos> Nice!<eos> That one's called Batgirl.<eos> If you call me Batgirl, can I call you Batboy?
Thanks.<eos> You're the security guard from Rand.<eos> Why are you...<eos> Go.<eos> Who sent you?
You're the security guard from Rand.<eos> Why are you...<eos> Go.<eos> Who sent you?<eos> Who sent you?
huh?<eos> See?<eos> He loves me.<eos> Dad.<eos> - What the hell is wrong with you?
Let it go.<eos> And this is your home.<eos> I know.<eos> I'll be out in 72 hours.<eos> That what they tell you?
Why would anyone be after you in the first place?<eos> okay?<eos> one of the richest families in New York?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And they have a problem with you?
Sorry.<eos> Wish I could say more.<eos> Danny.<eos> Harold?<eos> Do you remember that song I used to sing... that would annoy the shit out of you?
of course not.<eos> why would you come here to see me?<eos> I don't know shit.<eos> I'm trying to figure out what's going on.<eos> Every word I have ever told you is the truth.
Just cooperate.<eos> - Please.<eos> - Yeah, I get it.<eos> Hey, I love you, Ward.<eos> I love you so much.
I don't wanna have to call an ambulance, huh?<eos> - For him?<eos> - Cut the bullshit.<eos> You get in over your head, you tap out.<eos> And Rusty, I warned you last time about the biting.
Danny.<eos> You died.<eos> - I saw pictures.<eos> I did die.<eos> You look the same age as when I last saw you.
Daniel Rand's miraculous return to Rand Enterprises is making headlines once again after a video where he apologizes for a corporate scandal puts the fate of the company at stake.<eos> Suck on that, Dad.<eos> A spokesperson for the class action suit claimed that Rand Enterprises callously turned a blind eye when it was brought to their attention that a chemical plant may have been responsible for 15 cases of cancer in a Staten Island neighborhood, endangering the lives of innocent children.<eos> Better put that hood up.<eos> - Does it bother you?
Gao will know they're missing, but as long as it looks as though they did their job before they left...<eos> What job?<eos> To remind me of my mistakes.<eos> Do you understand how stupid that was?<eos> What if someone had seen you in there?
"My actions were impulsive, and I now realize the severity of my words."<eos> Is this an apology?<eos> No, it's the statement you're gonna be making at the board meeting this afternoon.<eos> It sort of seems like an apology.<eos> Well... apologies are what got you into this disaster, so, yeah, officially, it's a statement.
Hey, listen.<eos> I'm sorry I snapped at you last night.<eos> I love you.<eos> And... I mean, you... you're the only family I have left.<eos> And maybe what's happening to you is partly my fault, too.
That's just mean, Ward.<eos> You should be grateful.<eos> Yeah. You wouldn't have a life without me.<eos> I've given you everything.<eos> I've shown you how to run the company, how to be respected, how to be feared.
What are you doing?<eos> Come on.<eos> No. Not till you explain this.<eos> The truth is... I'm having financial trouble.<eos> I brought you here to ask you for money, but you're making me feel like an asshole, so forget about it.
I don't believe you.<eos> Why are you lying to me?<eos> Just stay away.<eos> Don't go near there, okay?<eos> I'll call you tomorrow.
Call me back, tell me what's going on, or I'll find out on my own.<eos> Your choice.<eos> Hello?<eos> Kyle?<eos> After your mother delivered you... the nurse wrapped you in a blanket... placed you in my arms.
I'm sorry.<eos> I never meant it.<eos> Please, please, please, please, forgive me.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you so much.
So you'll let me go?<eos> I want my family back, healthy and whole.<eos> I mean it.<eos> I'll do anything, anything to make that happen.<eos> I was only trying to toughen you up so you could... face this world and win.
When I was sick?<eos> And you and Ward were there every two hours.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, we had to turn you in your bed.<eos> Keep you from getting bedsores.
When you find him, you will tell me where he is.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey, Danny.<eos> I've been looking everywhere for you.
To become the kind of people who help make the world a better place.<eos> He's getting them jobs in hospitals and businesses.<eos> He's using them for his own means.<eos> It's the same thing he's doing to you.<eos> Are you gonna believe everything they taught you in K'un-Lun?
- You're wrong!<eos> Why are you even here, Colleen?<eos> Because... because I care about you.<eos> And the way things are going... I wanted to say I tried... to make things right between us.<eos> Did Bakuto tell you to say that, too?
It's no wonder you can't summon the Iron Fist.<eos> You know, last week, if you would have told me that I'd be here, working with my daughter, I wouldn't have believed it.<eos> Reunion would be a hell of a lot better if we weren't taking down drug dealers.<eos> Oh, well, we take our blessings where we can find 'em.<eos> You used to say that to me when I'd sit with you during your chemo treatments.
Wait for Bakuto to leave the building, then we take him down.<eos> I'm not losing my family to the Hand again. - Danny.<eos> - I'm the Iron Fist.<eos> You don't tell me what to do.<eos> I'm gonna get you through this.
- No. It's not okay. - Shh.<eos> Shut up!<eos> Oh, I'm sorry for the outburst.<eos> You carry on.<eos> Once they leave the building, I'll get you to the hospital.
Once they leave the building, I'll get you to the hospital.<eos> Hey, it's okay.<eos> Hey, get your ass over here and help us.<eos> Those people upstairs are pit of vipers.<eos> You should thank me for getting you away from them.
These two are warriors.<eos> You are nothing but a betrayer.<eos> You have no honor.<eos> I should have recognized you were too weak to be Hand.<eos> Deep in your soul, you know that you are nothing more than a teacher of children at a dojo that I gave you.
- You are a failure.<eos> - It's not that simple!<eos> You of all people don't get a say in this!<eos> Don't talk to her like that.<eos> K'un-Lun would have been better off if Chodak and Tashi had never found you.
- It's not that simple!<eos> You of all people don't get a say in this!<eos> Don't talk to her like that.<eos> K'un-Lun would have been better off if Chodak and Tashi had never found you.<eos> You'd choose this putrid hellhole over the people who raised you?
K'un-Lun would have been better off if Chodak and Tashi had never found you.<eos> You'd choose this putrid hellhole over the people who raised you?<eos> Get up!<eos> This has nothing to do with K'un-Lun.<eos> This is because I left you.
Now we'll get rich both ends.<eos> Dad.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - You owe Danny.<eos> He freed you from the Hand.
Jesus!<eos> Is there a version of this where we don't kill someone?<eos> - The tablet. How do we get the tablet?<eos> - Ward.<eos> He texted you to warn you about the DEA, right?
I mean, you've been lying to me... all these years.<eos> That was Dad's decision.<eos> But you went along with it.<eos> What about the drug abuse?<eos> Who forced you to lie about that?
I don't know.<eos> Anyway. All right, this is dream Friday, the latest in our long tradition of presenting our newest innovations.<eos> The first dream Friday featured Ty lafitte, the inventor of trueyou and our founding father.<eos> And usually, we feature one of our engineers or our visionaries, but today, unfortunately, it's just me, and for that, I apologize in advance.<eos> - We love you, eamon!
I'm good.<eos> You should come visit me at work sometime.<eos> At the circle?<eos> I'll give that idea a smile, right?<eos> Come on. They'd love you.
I can send tech out-- yeah.<eos> Yeah, we disconnected them.<eos> Sweetheart...<eos> We're sorry, but we can't keep doing this.<eos> Lt's-- it's more than we ever-- you know, we love you and we don't want to- love you, love you- we have to have our privacy.
Listen, Mae, I'm really, really sorry about Mercer.<eos> I'm a shit friend. I should've said something sooner.<eos> I should've, and I'm sorry.<eos> It's just so horrible.<eos> Have they spoken to you about him?
Gianna.<eos> There was a time not so long ago in which I considered us as friends.<eos> I still do.<eos> Yet here you are.<eos> What brought you back, John?
Yes, John. Whatever you'd like, John.<eos> Would you like a back rub with that, John?<eos> You're going to help me.<eos> Why the fuck would I do that?<eos> Because I'm the only one that can help you.
Oh, Stella, this is Patrick, my new coach.<eos> - Nice to meet you.<eos> - You, too.<eos> Oh, honey, I am so glad you called.<eos> Did you get the casserole I sent over? I did, yeah, thank you.
Shit, and say what?<eos> Just like chopper.<eos> Not another word out of you, Irish!<eos> What you want me to say to him?<eos> Think of the first nice thing someone said to you when you went to prison.
Hey, there.<eos> You must be one of those guys they're looking for.<eos> What are you doing? What are you doing out here?<eos> I'm not gonna hurt you.<eos> Yeah, somebody trained you really well.
But I don't see how.<eos> The things you want, you said that's the way you are.<eos> But what happened last time, that's not gonna happen again.<eos> How can you say that?<eos> I know that I asked you to show me how far it can go, but you were getting off on the pain you inflicted.
Thanks, Taylor.<eos> No strings attached.<eos> This is spiky.<eos> I like it.<eos> I'll call you tomorrow.
She's been gone for three hours, and she doesn't have her cell or her purse.<eos> Forget it.<eos> She's here.<eos> Where the fuck have you been?<eos> I told you to come straight here.
Is she here?<eos> What?<eos> No, of course not.<eos> She's in the psych ward getting the help that she needs.<eos> Look, I know she scared you...
It's your birthday.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Happy birthday.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Do you still have that gift I gave you?
Don't do that.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Stop crying, mom.<eos> Can't help it.<eos> I love you so much.
Give me your hand.<eos> Did you do that?<eos> Great, isn't it?<eos> That's so pretty.<eos> I solemnly vow to love you faithfully and to keep you safe for as long as we both shall live.
Hm.<eos> nothing.<eos> Gary, won't you at least take off the wig?<eos> I mean, really, it's been a--<eos> Yeah, yeah. Love you, too, Dad.
Bonnie.<eos> Frank.<eos> For the record, I didn't wanna go to the stupid school in the first place.<eos> And the boy in the next row acts inappropriately for someone who's a child.<eos> I'm sorry. I'm still passive aggressively ignoring you.
Oh this is just the tip of the iceberg.<eos> You know what I like about you, Dom.<eos> You're a genuine outlaw.<eos> I mean, you're a man who lives by his own rules.<eos> Which was surprising because when I saw you in Cuba, I heard about a guy who almost killed you with a motorcycle and you..
This is fucking on me.<eos> But I'm gonna fucking hit them. I'm gonna check their fucking asses, I'm gonna find out who took those shots and I'm gonna fucking hit them.<eos> Not until the deal's done.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I'm on it.<eos> Man, I know you like the fucking kid.
- Fuck you! - Hey, Manu?<eos> Just... please.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Listen, we are here to apologize to you, Steve for kicking the shit out of you.
Apart from you.<eos> You can spare me the old maiden splutter, Brace.<eos> I know that you polish off at least half a bottle of Delaney Company Brandy every night.<eos> You could have written to your father just once.<eos> In the end, he was calling for you.
Your man did not heed my warning...<eos> You don't want much, do you?<eos> You were meant to be guarding his ship.<eos> Two possibilities.<eos> He sold you out, cos you cut off his thumb, or you cut off his thumb, cos you knew he was going to sell you out.
I need a ship and passage.<eos> James, they're not going to give you a ship, they're going to hang you!<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Look... go to this address, all right?<eos> There will be a man with markings on his face to meet you... he will take you to my friend Atticus.
Honey,<eos> If I didn't work for the sheriff, You'd be in jail right now.<eos> I'll loan you the money.<eos> Ugh, no.<eos> I can't take any more money from you, mom.
I've been good to you.<eos> You always say it, how I've been good to you.<eos> Who cares?<eos> What?<eos> I got to thank you every hour on the hour, get on my knees and adore you?
You were supposed to call her, but you never did.<eos> Don't be sore at me, Audrey.<eos> You know I just want the best for you.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Well, then sign the papers I gave you.
- Come here.<eos> - Good girl.<eos> - Good girl.<eos> I love you.<eos> - I love you too.
Fine.<eos> You win.<eos> But just this once.<eos> I'm kidding.<eos> Can I help you?
It's okay.<eos> Shh. It's okay.<eos> Um, hey, if you, give me a minute<eos> I can give you a lift back into town, if you want?<eos> What can I help you with?
- Excuse me, what did you say?<eos> You may think you're winning the battle but I'll win the war.<eos> Careful, Ali.<eos> You don't wanna leave a bruise.<eos> I could bury you with that.
I think what I need is sleep.<eos> We're gonna be okay.<eos> I just wish that you had as much faith in me as I have in you.<eos> - I love you.<eos> - I love you too.
And you make me a better woman because you searched for one.<eos> Do you promise... to do that everyday for the rest of our lives?<eos> Yes.<eos> - I love you.<eos> - I love you too.
You can deal with Mona until then, right?<eos> Sure.<eos> How much damage can she do in one night?<eos> - I love you.<eos> - I love you too.
- Hi.<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> What do you mean she escaped?<eos> We don't have the details, but we'll stay in constant touch with the state police.<eos> And if Mary Drake does try to reach out to you...
So then what's gonna happen now?<eos> You can't just keep me here forever.<eos> Of course, I can.<eos> And you have Mary to thank for that.<eos> She saved you at the blind school and she's saving you now.
No, I'll drive you.<eos> It'll be too hard to say goodbye to you.<eos> I almost forgot.<eos> It's my favorite.<eos> I love you, Alex.
- No.<eos> Well, Ezra's booked us yesterday to take him and his wife up to kick off their honeymoon.<eos> When yesterday?<eos> Morning around, 10 o'clock through The Radley concierge.<eos> Why would Ezra book you on a hot air balloon ride if he wasn't planning on marrying you?
I called 911.<eos> Mary Drake's already in custody.<eos> We caught her a few blocks from here.<eos> We'll take it from here.<eos> Well, no one can call you loser Mona anymore.
Why is everybody crying?<eos> I don't know.<eos> For some reason, this feels like it's the end of something.<eos> I love you, guys.<eos> We love you too.
Mrs. Klein, I'm so sorry...<eos> - Is she okay? - I don't know.<eos> They're gonna find out. Just give her a second.<eos> - Did you see what happened?<eos> Um, Amabella, sweetie, could you maybe point to the boy who hurt you?
And he got it all. He won.<eos> Well, speaking as the consolation prize, we're gonna have a pretty big fight - about what you just said. - No, no, no.<eos> I did not mean it like that.<eos> You are the greatest thing that ever happened to me, and don't you for one minute think anything else.<eos> It's just entirely possible for me to love you with all my heart and still feel...
Great.<eos> Good to keep up business.<eos> Yes, and I was thinking maybe it's time we paint.<eos> We haven't redone the exterior of the motel in a few years now, and that hardware store just reopened.<eos> I wish I could go down to the village with you and look.
Sorry about the village.<eos> But it's just the same old village, though.<eos> I know.<eos> And I'd give up a million villages just to be with you here forever.<eos> - I love you, Mother.
I have driven the car, you know, Mother. Many times.<eos> You know that. But you shouldn't be; You have blackouts.<eos> Is this just your passive-aggressive way of getting me not to go to the meeting?<eos> You know, Norman, sometimes you can be so full of yourself.<eos> No, no... this is not my way of keeping you from doing anything except having blackouts while you're driving. Okay?
I know you better than you know yourself.<eos> And that's why you make me so angry...<eos> Because you keep doing shit that just makes more work for me.<eos> Asking me questions that I can't give you answers to because I'm just trying to take care of you.<eos> Well, who asked you to take care of me?
What is that? What's going on, buddy?<eos> Does your dick bend weird when it gets hard?<eos> - All right.<eos> - Doesn't matter.<eos> Let's get you on Tinder right now, so you can start on a rebound.
I have changed.<eos> I thought that I was making people's lives better, but I forgot about the people that make my life better, and that's you guys.<eos> - And I love you, and I'm sorry.<eos> - We love you, too.<eos> - We love you, too. - We love you.
I thought that I was making people's lives better, but I forgot about the people that make my life better, and that's you guys.<eos> - And I love you, and I'm sorry.<eos> - We love you, too.<eos> - We love you, too. - We love you.<eos> - We love you, Jess!
Baby, you're not a monster.<eos> You are not a monster.<eos> Ziggy there's nothing wrong with you.<eos> Okay?<eos> I love you so much.
Look where it got me.<eos> I'm, uh... heading to Florida next week for my daughter's fifth birthday.<eos> I'm using my take to set up her college fund.<eos> Yeah. She's awful sweet.<eos> And lucky to have you for a father.
Well, you've called me worse.<eos> I suppose.<eos> It doesn't mean anything, you know that.<eos> What about you, Red?<eos> You hate me for taking you away from your father?
But I'm an actress.<eos> Speech and Debate sounds like homework that nerds want to do because regular homework isn't, I don't know, enough?<eos> Just read the part that says "D.I." on the home page.<eos> They call it competitive acting.<eos> You'll see why I called you.
Lucy, with your flair, you'll shine in the "Interp" categories, like... Dramatic Interpretation...<eos> Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."<eos> Group Interpretation...<eos> I have something worse than stomach cancer, and you gave it to me!<eos> The only thing I gave you was love.
I'm using their stage for my needs, not theirs, my terms.<eos> Life is a stage.<eos> Life is a stage.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I mean, somebody send you to spy on me?

Does he need to stay in there?<eos> He's still Theo.<eos> Theo saved Scott.<eos> Remember?<eos> He can still hear you.
Come on, guys.<eos> Look, I don't want in anyone's pack.<eos> I don't want anyone's power.<eos> I just wanna stay alive.<eos> How do we know if we let you out, you won't run?
Turns out, I wasn't his only victim.<eos> The man I've been chasing for two years was your fiancé.<eos> His real name is Benjamin Jones.<eos> I was going to tell you everything.<eos> What we had was real, and I love you.
You did this to me?<eos> Well, I hired someone.<eos> He's actually a very gifted serial killer.<eos> I'm sorry. What?<eos> Well, he stabbed you just deep enough for the guards to call the ambulance, but he missed all the major organs.
Yeah, but they won't.<eos> They won't, okay? I promise.<eos> Tommy, stop!<eos> Listen to me!<eos> If you touch that money, I cannot help you.
How do you do?<eos> I engineered the whole operation.<eos> Careful where you step.<eos> You don't want to slip and get pregnant.<eos> This will all make perfect sense once I explain it to you.
Julia..<eos> Weird!<eos> I'm going to pee, wanna join me?<eos> You're so stubborn.<eos> Everyone warned you about doing that stunt.
It'll take a lot more to kill me!<eos> Hello everybody!<eos> Ahuja!<eos> Why haven't you informed your family you survived Rangoon?<eos> Your mother thinks the Japanese killed you.
They'll find him just as they found you.<eos> Come on.<eos> Everyone's waiting.<eos> I can't.<eos> What have I always told you?
Sergeant Bahadur Chattri! - Oh Nawab!<eos> My friend Zulfi is no more.<eos> - Sergeant Nawab Malik!<eos> Nawab, what are you doing here?<eos> The Captain is calling for you.
Leave me a message.<eos> Hey, hon.<eos> I was hoping to catch you.<eos> It's my big test day, so wish me luck.<eos> Okay, love you.
No, it's Castillo.<eos> Agent Castillo.<eos> I know, It's a bummer, right?<eos> Look at those guys. Whoa!<eos> I took you on vacation to the Bahamas with my family.
That's my partner, Francis Poncherello.<eos> - What's up, bro?<eos> - Dude, that is awesome!<eos> You know, my cousin competed against you in freestyle.<eos> I cannot tell you how many times I've seen you ride.
- Christ.<eos> Fine!<eos> Just keep your mouth shut.<eos> Okay.<eos> Listen, I do need to warn you, though.
God damn it!<eos> Where'd they come from?<eos> Let's go, let's go!<eos> Look, I'm sorry you crashed, man.<eos> I tried to warn you.
Good morning.<eos> Uh, it's Officer Jon Baker, and I was wondering if you could patch me through to Ava Perez.<eos> It's an emergency.<eos> So, let me get this straight.<eos> You thought it was inappropriate to go on a motorcycle ride together and now, I'm supposed to come over to your bedroom, help you from your bed into your bathtub so you can pop some pills and loosen up?
I'll clean this fucking pigsty, but I'm not gonna carry you.<eos> You wouldn't be standing here!<eos> You can't lift me and take me to the tub?<eos> You know what?<eos> I'll drag you there, but I'm not gonna cradle you like a newborn.
Tone it down a little bit.<eos> Are you posted here?<eos> I came to see you, dummy, and just wanted to brag about saving your life.<eos> You saved my life?<eos> I gave you CPR and I breathed life back into you.
I was the one who helped you get away, remember?<eos> Who killed Jimmy Dunn?<eos> - I don't know anything.<eos> - You know too much.<eos> And if the Germans catch you, they'll make sure they know it, too.
I didn't know him long enough to really decide.<eos> Both brothers dead...<eos> You knew the Spodes, didn't you?<eos> You met them before the war, when you were writing an article on Professor Frick and his work,<eos> and I assume one of them contacted you with the plan to get the atomic calculations into American hands,
Yeah, little Armenian art dealer.<eos> Yeah, Graf von Garin now.<eos> Famous expert on Aryan art.<eos> Sell paintings, art treasures to the Germans... sell for them.<eos> Anyway, he phoned and invited you to some big do tomorrow night.
Don't tell them "no."<eos> Tell them "yes."<eos> Tell them "next week," or tell them "maybe."<eos> But don't tell them "no."<eos> Was it them who told you to go along to the antiques shop that day?
I love you.<eos> I love you more.<eos> I said it first. I mean it more.<eos> Ha.<eos> I love you more than all of those stars combined.
I love you more.<eos> I said it first. I mean it more.<eos> Ha.<eos> I love you more than all of those stars combined.<eos> I love you more than infinity times infinity.
Yeah?<eos> Yeah, you're probably right.<eos> Let's just call it a night, then.<eos> You think you're so irresistible, don't you?<eos> I love you so much.
I'm trying to be sensitive, honey. I... I don't always know the right thing to say.<eos> - But I certainly don't judge you.<eos> - I know.<eos> It's actually really weird.<eos> Ever since I told you about Ziggy's dad, it's like this thing that's been happening to my body.
What do you and Ziggy like to do together?<eos> We just like playing and stuff.<eos> And he's nice to you?<eos> Yes.<eos> Amabella... is somebody still hurting you?
I'm so sorry.<eos> I feel like you were driving less aware...<eos> I'm here 'cause some kid ran a stop sign.<eos> I think I owe you some clarity.<eos> Like you said, I kissed you back the other day.
But I... I just stopped by to see if Joseph was okay.<eos> I'm glad to see you're feeling better.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I'm just gonna head out now. - Okay.<eos> - But good to see you, Tori.
What are you trying to show me?<eos> You're here.<eos> Here she is, Samara!<eos> This is what becomes of your savior!<eos> With the grace of the Holy Spirit, may the Lord who freed you from sin save you, and raise you up!
This isn't going anywhere.<eos> I don't wanna lose you.<eos> I can't even go outside.<eos> What are you really losing?<eos> Dear Mom, The first thing is that I love you.
- Are you sure? - Yeah.<eos> I'm okay, Olly.<eos> It's nice to be able to talk to you again.<eos> I tried to visit, but your mom wouldn't let me.<eos> Yeah, I'm sorry I put you through all of that.
You learned a tough lesson, and I can't imagine you repeating it.<eos> Good.<eos> I wish you'd talk to me.<eos> I'll never meet anyone like you, Maddy.<eos> You look at the ocean like it was meant for you.
I smell snow.<eos> Hello?<eos> I love you.<eos> Something feels weird.<eos> I love you, too.
You drive where needs driving to.<eos> You take care of things generally on my behalf.<eos> And in an emergency, and in an emergency only, you kick the asses of those whose asses require kicking.<eos> And in the unlikely event of my death, you will hold my vigil.<eos> He's hustling you.
They did a hell of a job reconstructing her face and neck.<eos> I think that and the coffin just killed your savings.<eos> All so you could have that nice open casket, get one last look at her pretty face.<eos> I'm sorry about Robbie, okay?<eos> He was a really good friend, and I know he loved you like crazy.
I have a house full of guests and a garage full of caterers and you brought me a dead girl?<eos> Hi.<eos> - You have a lovely home.<eos> - Don't stoop.<eos> Somebody tried to raise you with refined manners, dead girl, and failed.
This is all just a ploy to get to you.<eos> It's not too late for us.<eos> Okay, get your own girl.<eos> Goddamn.<eos> She's all mad at you 'cause you never take my advice.
It's a service we provide.<eos> I'm good, actually.<eos> Yes.<eos> Thank you, though.<eos> Well, smoker or not, we're thrilled to have you up here for the big get-together.
I'm sorry.<eos> This sucks.<eos> What?<eos> Why you saying "sorry"?<eos> 'Cause I brought you here and I'm related to all of them.
This sucks.<eos> Let's go home.<eos> I'll make something up.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you too, baby.
Good night.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Come on, sweetie.<eos> Good night, Chris!<eos> It was great to meet you.
Nina, this isn't personal.<eos> Feldman's making me an offer.<eos> I'm only one filthy secret away from going global.<eos> And it's your son who's going to take me there.<eos> You were a whimpering little twit when I hired you.
Nice view.<eos> It's like a different city at night.<eos> I was talking about your ass.<eos> But the lights are pretty too.<eos> He sent you, right?
Mnh-mnh. Nobody wants that.<eos> Did I leave the toilet seat up again?<eos> Can you just put on a shirt, please.<eos> Why?<eos> It never bothered you before.
To get there.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's okay.<eos> They didn't want me to come.<eos> Can you imagine feeling abandoned 'cause your dad left you out of the family suicide?
We've gotta pull him out right now.<eos> One... two... three.<eos> You okay?<eos> - Yeah. - Hey, come here.<eos> Let me help you.
Cable didn't buy interracial.<eos> So I was unable to do interracial when I was under contract.<eos> People were telling me all day long, like,<eos> "if you do interracial, it's going to ruin your career.<eos> "No one's going to hire you as a feature dancer.
And she was sitting on the sofa, and there was her costar on the other end of the sofa.<eos> This is before filming.<eos> I used to get in trouble on every single set.<eos> Once my makeup was done, I'm on you.<eos> I'd be sucking your dick, I'd be kissing you, you know, and then have to redo my makeup.
I said, "I'm in theater, I'm doing legitimate theater."<eos> I'm not no porno star."<eos> They go, "Yes, you are."<eos> I go, "What are you talking about?"<eos> They go, "We got a $50,000 check waiting for you", "and you gotta go to Cannes Film Festival because they're dying to meet you."
Not so wonderful.<eos> We'll continue our discussion of nonverbal signals tomorrow.<eos> So, until then, make note, be aware.<eos> I'm not angry you betrayed me.<eos> I'm angry that I trusted you in the first place.
You know, I miss her, too.<eos> A lot.<eos> You and Hannah were friends.<eos> Well, you know, friendship's complicated, but... we were, yeah.<eos> She ever tell you... Did she ever say anything about me?
Well, you know, friendship's complicated, but... we were, yeah.<eos> She ever tell you... Did she ever say anything about me?<eos> Anything... bad?<eos> God, no!<eos> No, Clay, she liked you so much.
I don't know anybody.<eos> What's your name?<eos> It's Alex.<eos> Alex Standall.<eos> Okay, Alex Alex Standall... we are prepared to invite you to our table if you can answer one question.
What if we find out something we don't want to know?<eos> I know our daughter.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Hi, um, it's Olivia Baker.<eos> I'm sorry to bother you again.
Don't you have a concert?<eos> I did, yeah, but... actually, I quit jazz band.<eos> It's just pointless.<eos> Oh, look!<eos> Your boyfriend's waiting for you.
- Clay.<eos> - Oh, it speaks!<eos> Clay, those guys are using you.<eos> They just want to shut you down.<eos> And whatever they're offering you, they're lying.
You two worked together?<eos> Right.<eos> At the Crestmont.<eos> I wonder if she said anything to you.<eos> Did she ever talk to you about her experiences at school?
This is amazing.<eos> I fucking love these peanut butter and cheese crackers, even though they don't taste like peanut butter or cheese.<eos> God, you would make the best soccer mom, dude.<eos> Thank you, Jess.<eos> I'm sorry I slapped you that one time.
Yeah, that smell is me.<eos> You're really not doing so well.<eos> No.<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> Hey... it's good to talk to you about this.
Is everything okay?<eos> Yeah, yeah, great.<eos> Clay, I need to talk to you.<eos> Do you know anything about any kids getting bullied at your school?<eos> Why, did someone call you?
We can't only blame ourselves... or be looking for signs everywhere.<eos> Okay?<eos> Maybe we should be blaming ourselves.<eos> I mean, if we weren't so preoccupied with the fucking store.<eos> - The store's how we survive. - No, no, no. The store was to get you out of that company that was killing you to get us out of that shitty suburban wasteland.
She's nice.<eos> So you only like nice girls?<eos> That's not what I said.<eos> I just thought you were cooler than... a Sheri.<eos> I waited for you, Marcus.
What do you mean, nothing?<eos> He said you'd been following him.<eos> He's just a little out of his head lately.<eos> Too much caffeine.<eos> That's the kid who keeps texting you?
Stop!<eos> What the fuck, Justin?<eos> - I told you, my mom...<eos> - Your mom what? Huh?<eos> It never stopped you before.
And we will... keep going and keep searching and keep fighting for as long as you want to.<eos> As long as we have to.<eos> Whatever they throw at us... it's you and me against the world.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I love you, too.
You're going to tell me this one's no big deal... but let me tell you about being lonely.
Leave me alone!<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> Sorry.<eos> This shit that happens to you... I think some of it you bring on yourself.
What you're so sure of, but you won't say how.<eos> Huh?<eos> Fine.<eos> Forget you, then.<eos> Let me help you.
Now then, before we begin, Hannah, would you like to introduce yourself?<eos> Hi, I'm Hannah.<eos> Hi, Hannah.<eos> I don't know a lot about poetry, but I'm very happy to be here.<eos> We're very happy to have you here.
- Why aren't you?<eos> Cut it the fuck out.<eos> - Throw it back.<eos> - Jess, stop.<eos> Jess, what is happening with you?
I just, um... helped him with punctuation and word choice and stuff like that.<eos> You know, research techniques and...<eos> Well, we sure are grateful.<eos> You were a good friend to him.<eos> How come we haven't met you before if you're such a good friend?
But he was older than me, and on the baseball team and everything, and I wasn't really anybody.<eos> Well... you were to him.<eos> Yeah.<eos> He was really nice to me.<eos> So, Clay, what brings you here?
- Mostly dry.<eos> - Do you wanna maybe go...<eos> - Say no more.<eos> Let's...<eos> It's, uh, nice of Jeff to force you to come tonight.
Kind of.<eos> But it's strictly coincidental.<eos> If it's strictly coincidental, then why is he watching us?<eos> I mean, he does take an interest in my social life.<eos> Uh-huh. So... you tutor him in academics, and he tutors you in...
You're different.<eos> You're good and kind... and decent.<eos> And I didn't deserve to be with someone like you.<eos> I never would.<eos> I would have ruined you.
- Yes, you did.<eos> When you saw that picture!<eos> I didn't believe it.<eos> I was angry for a minute because... because I was jealous of Justin.<eos> And I was mad at you for wanting him and not me.
I didn't believe it.<eos> I was angry for a minute because... because I was jealous of Justin.<eos> And I was mad at you for wanting him and not me.<eos> And I was an asshole, and I'm sorry.<eos> And I can never make it right, I can never say all this to you, but... I love you.
Let's go.<eos> - Tell me why you care.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> Tell me why you fucking care!<eos> Because he fucking raped you!
It's... probably for me, don't you think?<eos> Morning.<eos> Are you the parent or guardian of Clay Jensen?<eos> I just don't get why they're calling you to testify.<eos> Did Hannah ever say anything to you about bullying or anything?
Clay, I'm...<eos> I'm really sorry about Jeff.<eos> I heard his funeral was beautiful.<eos> Sounds like the whole school was there.<eos> Thought I might see you there.
- You heard about that?<eos> - Yeah, everybody did.<eos> Any time one of the squeaky clean kids gets dirty, it's pretty big news.<eos> That's... interesting.<eos> I'm gonna hook you up this time 'cause you seem desperate, and I happen to have shit on hand.
- I'm just eating breakfast.<eos> - You disappeared again.<eos> There are consequences when you disappear.<eos> I didn't disappear, for fuck's sake. I was at a friend's house.<eos> A friend who beat you senseless?
But if you want to fight... if you want him to pay you for what he did, these tapes can help.<eos> They're proof.<eos> You want me to tell the whole goddamn world what happened to me?<eos> I want you to do what you want to do.<eos> Whatever's going to make this better for you, if anything can.
Your Majesty, I only told them of the...<eos> Our deal with the Saviors is not known among my people... for good cause.<eos> We made you a party to that secret when you told us of the Hilltop's own travails, but we did not expect you to share...<eos> We can help each other.<eos> We brought you into our confidence.
You're not me.<eos> Go home, Benjamin.<eos> Wha... - What?<eos> Ezekiel's gonna keep coming out here to check on you.<eos> He doesn't want to bug you, but he needs to know that you're okay.
Yeah.<eos> Part of your deal?<eos> What the hell's wrong with you?<eos> You're bleeding.<eos> They did that to you.
His loss, our gain.<eos> I feel like I need to give you some kind of signing bonus here.<eos> W-well, I wa... I was gifted these pickles.<eos> No.<eos> As a token of my gratitude, I'm gonna send you over a few of my wives to your apartment tonight, show you a good time.
Cool!<eos> Finally.<eos> No, I mean, I'm gonna light this candle.<eos> Honey?<eos> D...wealwayssaid that if we got separated, I should come back here and wait for you. You'd show up with beer and pretzels.
And, yeah, maybe I'd be dead, too, but who gives a damn?<eos> Eugene would still be here.<eos> Olivia would still be alive.<eos> Spencer would still be alive.<eos> And now they're gone, and I'm here because I was stupid enough to listen to you.
He wanted me to keep the whole story about you from everybody.<eos> Told me not to say where you were, and I did what you asked.<eos> Daryl didn't find you because of me.<eos> And what was said between you and him was said between you and him.<eos> I will go with you to Alexandria, if you want to make the trip... if you want to talk to him.
Is it what you wanted?<eos> Was it just too late to get away?<eos> Hey, we can leave for Alexandria right now.<eos> Right now, if you want to.<eos> Is there anything I can help you with? - No.
Because they'll kill us.<eos> If we're out here, we're alive. We get another go.<eos> Nothing is wrong with me, Sasha.<eos> I'm gonna make sure he's dead.<eos> Look, if this is too much for you, you want to bail, now's your chance.
If you're having problems of that nature... come to see me.<eos> Anytime.<eos> I don't know where to go.<eos> I'll arrange it so that you just tell the guard who you are...<eos> ...and he'll let you right in.
Do you?<eos> No.<eos> Well, I can forgive that.<eos> Last night was kind of a shitstorm.<eos> I was the guy that gave the rope to the guys that tied you up.
like, just now.<eos> Jesus.<eos> That is timing.<eos> Well, Rick... you chose this.<eos> I truly don't know what more I could've done to warn you.
No?<eos> I need a good shake.<eos> So, you, uh... you're primarily a striker?<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> I got a black belt in BJJ, so I can help you out there, too, so...
- All right, we're gonna break something.<eos> I can't afford to replace anything.<eos> All right, on three, we're gonna let each other go.<eos> On three, on three.<eos> Oh, I love you so much.
You've been keeping your lip zipped about it since Grandpa got arrested, but the fact is, you're freaking stoked to bail on him.<eos> He bails on everybody!<eos> He bailed on Mom when she was a kid!<eos> He - - He bailed on tiny planet!<eos> And in case I never made this clear to you, Summer, he bailed on you.
He bails on everybody!<eos> He bailed on Mom when she was a kid!<eos> He - - He bailed on tiny planet!<eos> And in case I never made this clear to you, Summer, he bailed on you.<eos> He left you to rot in a world that he ruined because he doesn't care!
R-Rick?<eos> Why not shoot through her?<eos> 20 yards, nine-gauge plasma pistol,<eos> My first shot would liquify her insides and injure you, second shot adds recoil.<eos> The risk to me is minimized if I wait for you to shoot her, which I'm encouraging you to do.
Jerry's going to... spend some time... divorced.<eos> Oh, I-I'm sorry to hear that, sweetie.<eos> I hope I had nothing to do with that.<eos> Oh, God, Dad, that is not your burden to bear.<eos> I feel terrible that I misjudged you.
- You don't even know what it means!<eos> That's because losers look stuff up while the rest of us are carping' all them diems.<eos> Listen to your sister, Morty.<eos> To live is to risk it all.<eos> Otherwise, you're just an inert chunk of randomly assembled molecules drifting wherever the universe blows you.
You were looking right at me.<eos> [ Sighs ] I just wanted to say goodbye to the kids.<eos> Cool.<eos> Just stay in the driveway.<eos> The killbots are live, and I took you off the white list.
Yes.<eos> I'm glad that you came.<eos> And now... I need you to go.<eos> They say your ship is ready to depart.<eos> The launch awaits you at the jetty.
I go looking for Eleanor Guthrie, you know I'm gonna find her, too.<eos> Max.<eos> Said if I turned over the cache, you'd be safe.<eos> And it ain't just the lie.<eos> She tried to take you away from me.
This is about the parents, and I'm not gonna have you bulldozed out of Monterey.<eos> - Neither will I, for what it's worth.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> A lot of parents are probably applauding you right now.
So, the spermatozoa fertilizes the egg.<eos> Women lay eggs?<eos> No, women have eggs inside of them, in their bellies.<eos> So, the sperm fertilize the egg in there, and out of that comes the baby.<eos> So, you wanted a baby and my dad "ferlitized" you?
Sorry, poor form.<eos> I know you're friends with Madeline. - It's all good.<eos> - Everything okay here?<eos> - Everything's great.<eos> So nice of you to ask, Harper.
- Call Celeste, okay?<eos> - I will.<eos> - Bye, Tom.<eos> - Bye.<eos> You know, I've actually been trying to figure out a way to impress you for a while now.
- He escaped.<eos> You can hug him now.<eos> They won't believe it unless it's harsh.<eos> Jeez, now I know why I quit therapy.<eos> What brings you by, Kev-o?
It's still happening.<eos> Brought y'all some supper.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Well, John, I'm glad you asked, 'cause what's going on is Matt and your son are writing a gospel about me.<eos> I shot you in the chest... point-blank.
Do unto others as you'd wish them to do unto you.<eos> I'm sorry, I'm at fault.<eos> Stop, don't try that on me.<eos> You're right, we should treat others as we wish to be treated.<eos> I've punished you by making you dance, by taking away your dignity in public.
So you get back human form when you sneeze.<eos> You should've said so, it's hard work pulling you.<eos> Master, even if you don't want to pee, try to pee just a little.<eos> Make a puddle to look at your reflection.<eos> I'm handsome, does that bother you?
I don't know what the misunderstanding is but please let my mother go.<eos> Spare the lives of my family.<eos> Don't be rash!<eos> Let her go.<eos> Master likes this young woman, but he still loves you too.
I was thinking, maybe... you and Ray...<eos> What?<eos> You and Ray.<eos> Me and Ray?<eos> Is that what he's telling you? Varga?
You're sweet.<eos> Hon.<eos> Where did you go?<eos> Jesus!<eos> I just love you so much. No.
Are we worth less?<eos> You and me, our value, I'm saying, to the world?<eos> What makes him rich, and us not?<eos> Larceny.<eos> Your brother stole from you, your birthright, like the snake in the garden, and then he built this falsehood.
Honestly... If you'd asked me yesterday,<eos> I'd have said I couldn't go lower than sitting in jail, staring at a life behind bars, or the electric chair.<eos> But now, here we are today, lower still.<eos> Oh, I've been watching.<eos> This Varga fellow plucked you like a chicken.
- The coin you gave me?<eos> - Witness.<eos> He has a point.<eos> I gave you the wrong coin.<eos> The one I gave you was my lucky coin.
Damn right it will, travis.<eos> How many terraformers her family own, anyway?<eos> All of them.<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> I'll catch up with you in a minute.
I think I hear something.<eos> Violins.<eos> Schubert in d-minor.<eos> I think the lieutenant has the hots for you, bobbie.<eos> Shut your hole, or I'll assist you with that.
Then get rid of them.<eos> Yes. Of course.<eos> I'll sacrifice what's left of my credibility. For a few short-term trinkets.<eos> Sadavir.<eos> You're witnessing a discovery. That could rewrite the story of humankind, But your imagination takes you as far as.
I thought he was a decent guy.<eos> Decent guy?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Do you think you would've got off eros without him?<eos> No. But he wasn't a good enough friend to wait for you.
Chrisjen.<eos> Thank god. Are you all right?<eos> Perfect excuse not to quit drinking?<eos> This is our fault.<eos> We put you in the crosshairs.
Mmc!<eos> Good to see you, cotyar.<eos> If you'd known it was me, would you have come?<eos> Probably not.<eos> The last time I saw you was at charanpal's funeral.
Doing nothing is just as bad as doing the wrong thing.<eos> Being a bystander...<eos> I mean, what kind of people are we, That we only help...<eos> I'm sorry, darlin', I think that seat is taken.<eos> Your kopeng say he buy me drinks. If I sit here and listen to you.
He's been in the hospital, and now he's with us for a while.<eos> When do I meet him?<eos> You know what?<eos> You already have when you were a baby, at Aunt Maggie's.<eos> He bounced you on his knee, and you know what you did?
These I'm not even dealing with.<eos> It's just the Primidone.<eos> It's downstairs by his bed.<eos> I left it there.<eos> After he threw the glass at you.
She was seeing him on the side.<eos> All very secret.<eos> Okay, I am sending it... now.<eos> Got it.<eos> I'm sorry to rope you into this.
Of course.<eos> But I do now.<eos> It was in Berlin.<eos> In a barracks in Dahlem.<eos> They poisoned you...
But I do now.<eos> It was in Berlin.<eos> In a barracks in Dahlem.<eos> They poisoned you...<eos> a cell did... and left you for dead.
- Boy's got his own lawyer now.<eos> - Hey, hey, hey.<eos> - Damn! - Nah, nah, nah.<eos> - He's cool. He's cool.<eos> - How'd he get you out, anyways? It was bullshit.
Demanding that I come here, putting everything at risk?<eos> - It's already at risk.<eos> - This is not safe, Saul.<eos> Ten miles from the border?<eos> The Israelis catch you, they'll just ask you some awkward questions.
Half your country will wake up tomorrow convinced that we're cheating, and half of mine will wake up chanting, "Death to America."<eos> I still need the truth.<eos> That is the truth.<eos> Only you would call it succeeding.<eos> I forced you into this. You're right about that.
- It was a last-minute decision.<eos> - Come in, Etai.<eos> - No time.<eos> You'll be late for your flight.<eos> Allow us to drive you.
I-I don't even know where to begin.<eos> This is-- this is so fucked up.<eos> I--<eos> What I need to believe is that you're protecting Franny, okay?<eos> Because that's what I asked you to do when I left here this morning.
But the Director asked me to...<eos> Let me handle the Director.<eos> You can go.<eos> Ohh, I'm getting too old for this.<eos> They grilled you about your trip to the West Bank, huh?
What's it to you?<eos> Well, if you won't say, I will.<eos> It's Carrie Mathison.<eos> Her foundation represented the bomber.<eos> She's what's pulling you back to New York, isn't that it?
- No.<eos> You get to confess a bunch of shit about yourself, after which you may or may not be allowed to see your child someday in a supervised setting.<eos> On the positive side, the shrink said expect to hear from him soon. Plus, he was smiling, so... Fingers crossed.<eos> What's this?<eos> Um, according to cellphone records, it's where Conlin called you from just before he was killed.
Previously on Homeland...<eos> She's a Gold Star mom.<eos> She's tough to argue with.<eos> I applied for a job.<eos> It's where Conlin called you from just before he was killed.
Why, then?<eos> Lights out.<eos> Nothing till tom... morning.<eos> Good. Then maybe you can tell me what the hell is going on.<eos> Last time I saw you, you were being hauled off by orderlies at Bellevue.
There never was.<eos> Shut the fuck up!<eos> And you... you... changed... after the stroke.<eos> We both know it, and... and<eos> I am so, so sorry, what I did to you.
He's over there. He's back there.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Charlie?<eos> - Alex. Oh, my God.<eos> How come nobody's with you?
Alex, that's crazy.<eos> Charlie... you talk to ghosts.<eos> Don't talk to me about crazy.<eos> And I... I love you.<eos> I love you more than I've loved anyone in my entire life, but...
Oh, no, he told me. I'm staying out of it.<eos> So, you wanna tell me where the man on the pillar is?<eos> It's my understanding he departed.<eos> I didn't witness it myself, but that's what people saw.<eos> People also saw you with his wife.
Mm. "And she did kiss the lips of Kevin."<eos> "And lo, it was good."<eos> Love you.<eos> Try not to walk on too much water when I'm gone, okay? - I won't.<eos> And I love you, too.
When Abraham tried to sacrifice him.<eos> He was a grown man. 36 years old.<eos> That makes no fucking sense at all.<eos> Did you...<eos> Did you get the money I sent you?
- Just tell me what you fucking want.<eos> Why is this happening again?<eos> 'Cause I fucking finished this.<eos> So, what do you want?<eos> Did Patti send you?
What the fuck does that mean, Laurie? !<eos> Remember when you were seeing Patti and I told you that...<eos> I'm not seeing anybody.<eos> She's right fucking here!<eos> You were seeing Patti and I told you that you never tell someone in the midst of a psychotic break that they are in the midst of a psychotic break.
Can you do that for me, please?<eos> Okay, I did it.<eos> I want you to listen to me.<eos> Okay? I need you to listen to me very carefully.<eos> You could've called anybody you wanted when this happened, but you called me... because I think you knew that I could help you.
The explosion.<eos> I'll be back.<eos> Jesus.<eos> I can't believe you're actually here.<eos> I saw you on the TV in the window.
- Oh, you're immensely grateful?<eos> - Yes. But with all due respect, I'm not sure you entirely grasp what's happening here.<eos> Okay, uh, three years ago, my ex-husband experienced severe delusions and tried to kill himself.<eos> And instead of acknowledging his mental illness, you turned it into fucking scripture.<eos> And when he found out about it, he relapsed and ran halfway around the world, probably to get the fuck away from you.
When we find Kevin, you don't speak to him, okay?<eos> I will talk to him. He didn't call you.<eos> - He called me.<eos> - And what exactly did he say?<eos> What did he specifically say that leads you to believe he's delusional?
What you got there?<eos> Shoes.<eos> It's one hell of a shiner.<eos> You should see the other guy.<eos> I take it your husband told you we were here.
I'm of sound mind and body and give consent to go... to go wherever they went.<eos> Amen.<eos> So, the two women in that house, they recorded this?<eos> One would assume.<eos> And we're also assuming they're just gonna lead us right to this device they told you about?
Erika never doubted it. She took it in and moved on. But me, I just...<eos> I just couldn't believe it.<eos> I should've told you.<eos> Well, if you had, I wouldn't have talked you into helping people talk to their dead relatives.<eos> I thought I was helping you.
Fucking "Today's Special." Eat it, you fucker.<eos> Fuck, yes. - Yeah, yeah, okay.<eos> - I knew you'd remember.<eos> You know how many times I had to listen to that theme song?<eos> I'm really sorry I put you through that.
- I love you, Mom.<eos> - I love you, honey.<eos> Tell Tommy I love him.<eos> Mom loves you, you fucking idiot.<eos> I love you, too, Mommy!
You named me Secretary of Defense.<eos> You were asked who did you want in this position, and you named me.<eos> You summoned me out of retirement and I came back because I owed you.<eos> You helped me, Kevin.<eos> And now I'm here to help you.
Anyway, I know it sounds crazy, but I felt a connection.<eos> So, you know, here we are in the middle of nowhere bumping into each other, and I'm only here for the night, and I figured, you know, if I didn't ask you to dance tonight...<eos> You need to leave now.<eos> Okay.<eos> I get it. A guy you barely remember shows up on your doorstep, asks you to go on a date with him, but...
Keep what up?<eos> So, you and me, we only talked that one time at that Christmas dance in Mapleton.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We got our divorces on the same day and ran into each other.<eos> I asked you to go to Miami.
- You asked me to go to Miami?<eos> - Miami. Yes.<eos> But we were strangers?<eos> Yes.<eos> And you're giving me a hard time about inviting you to a dance?
But he landed on his feet, like he always does.<eos> - What about you?<eos> Did you ever get married again?<eos> Why not?<eos> Because I'm still holding a candle for you.
Okay.<eos> Hey, you hungry?<eos> Eat this, you idiot.<eos> Here. Come on.<eos> You wanna know how I found you, Nora?
And that should've convinced me, but I couldn't believe the last time I saw you or talked to you was in that fucking hotel room that night I burned his fucking book.<eos> I was so sure you were still alive, even though everyone else in the world said that you were fucking dead.<eos> I had to do something about it.<eos> So I decided that I was gonna look for you.<eos> I was gonna start right where I lost you.
I'm not doing this. "Never again."<eos> But every year, I would come back.<eos> Because... Because I couldn't stop.<eos> And a couple days ago...<eos> I showed your picture to that nun... and I saw it in her eyes. She recognized you.
-Sister Kimmy. It's Richard Shakeer-Mohammed.<eos> I had to join a Muslim gang and a white-power gang.<eos> It's sort of a Mrs. Doubtfire situation.<eos> I told you to stop calling me.<eos> Look, you think I really want to be wasting my prison phone time on you?
You can't put this on yourself.<eos> Are you going to help me or not?<eos> Even if I do, how do you expect to get into the station?<eos> In the back of a patrol car.<eos> You're gonna let them arrest you?
To try to change his mind?<eos> Nah, he gonna do what he gonna do.<eos> Right? You know the man you married.<eos> Look.<eos> I'm out of here as soon as I get a location on the Dominican deal, but, uh, I'll leave a man behind to watch you, and Aisha can get you whatever you need.
I was... worried.<eos> Hey. What's wrong?<eos> Hey. Look at me.<eos> You have to finish mixing the explosives.<eos> Have you forgotten what these people did to you?
Ben.<eos> - Where are you? - I need more time.<eos> Right, so CTU can track me.<eos> So I can get the list and you can get the money.<eos> Ben, I am trying to help you here, but you have got to give me some room.
So, Jerome's staying here to look after Nicole, all right?<eos> Since when you need my permission?<eos> Aisha, look, this business ain't never been easy, all right?<eos> But it's never been this hard neither.<eos> If I've been taking it out on you, I'm sorry.
- I promise I'll tell you everything, but you need to stay away from her until I get there.<eos> Please.<eos> Nicole. Oh, my God.<eos> Thank God you're all right.<eos> I'm sorry I haven't called you before now.
Listen, Nicole I know I haven't been hearing you.<eos> And I know I got a lot of things that I need to work on.<eos> But I promise you, I promise you things are gonna be different. Okay?<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too.
I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Stop right there.<eos> All right?<eos> I know what you was planning with Aisha.<eos> But right now, my men got you in their crosshairs.
And hopefully we can find out what he knows about Jadalla Bin-Khalid.<eos> You stole those schematics.<eos> When I've identified Gabriel, I'll look for a chance to lock him down.<eos> Have a TAC team standing by.<eos> Carter, you're predicating this entire plan on what Grimes told you.
He's proven he can't be trusted.<eos> This is the only chance we have right now to find Jadalla.<eos> I'm sending you the location where the TAC team should stage.<eos> He's wrong about me.<eos> Everything I told you is the truth.
Yeah, I...<eos> I thought so, too.<eos> Eric, what is going on?<eos> Listen, I want you to go to Christine's, and I'm gonna come get you as soon as I can, okay?<eos> I love you, Nicole.
I thought so, too.<eos> Eric, what is going on?<eos> Listen, I want you to go to Christine's, and I'm gonna come get you as soon as I can, okay?<eos> I love you, Nicole.<eos> I love you, too.
Amira, now!<eos> Please...<eos> Bind his wrists. Bind his wrists.<eos> Don't let your brother control you.<eos> I raised you to be better.
When?<eos> I will... I'll call them right now. Are you meeting me there?<eos> I'll see you soon.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too.
I need your help. I don't think Jadalla can set off any more attacks.<eos> - Not yet.<eos> - How do you know that?<eos> He contacted me. He said the flash drive containing the list of sleeper cells has been damaged, and he needs somebody to repair it.<eos> Why would he call you?
Oh, my God. And if I bring him somebody to repair the list, then he'll let them go.<eos> Uh, wait a minute.<eos> You're... you're not actually asking me to repair the drive, are you?<eos> I'm asking you to help me destroy it.<eos> I'm gonna bring you to him.
Well, actually, Mullins wants to ask you a few more questions<eos> - about your father.<eos> - I've already told him everything. Yeah, we need to go through it again.<eos> We don't know what details might be helpful.<eos> There's an agent waiting for you in the conference room.
Your father wasn't responding to conventional interrogation.<eos> We needed to try something else.<eos> Something else?<eos> We need to finish this conversation in person.<eos> I'll have CTU bring you over.
Nicole, get in the car, babe.<eos> Are you coming with us?<eos> Please.<eos> I need you to get in the car, now.<eos> What's gonna happen to you, Eric?
We need to call CTU.<eos> Hell no.<eos> Nah.<eos> Hey... look...<eos> Eric brought you to me because those people cannot be trusted.
Got it.<eos> Naseri.<eos> Be quiet.<eos> Think I wouldn't recognize you after what you did?<eos> Why is he calling you Naseri?
Me and Eric took those bitches down.<eos> That's good news.<eos> But where's Eric?<eos> Eric had some business to take care of.<eos> He'll call you as soon as he can.
I hope things work out between you and John.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I can manage.<eos> I've asked Dr. Waring to, uh, stop by tonight to...<eos> So he can, uh, take a look at you.
Are you here?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We made good time.<eos> I'm down here at security.<eos> I told them to bring you to me.
If I'd been at your side from the beginning, maybe this wouldn't have happened to you.<eos> It has happened for a reason.<eos> When I left for Europe, I...<eos> I thought I was joining a better world.<eos> When I heard the Americans had murdered you, I...
"East July" is a subheading of some folders in the server at the office of the D.N.I.<eos> Well, what was in it?<eos> I don't know, I can't tell you.<eos> When I tried to access the folders, some firewall kicked in.<eos> And you used the clearance profile that I gave you?
_<eos> What's your name?<eos> Ara.<eos> Ara. That's a beautiful name.<eos> My name is Eric, and I'm here to help you.
Ara.<eos> Ara. That's a beautiful name.<eos> My name is Eric, and I'm here to help you.<eos> Help?<eos> What these people did to you is wrong.
You have information that could potentially save Rebecca's life and you're holding onto it so that you could cover your ass?<eos> He kidnapped Naseri's ten-year-old daughter.<eos> If we can get the girl from the safe house, prove to Naseri that his daughter's still alive, we might be able to negotiate.<eos> Ara, my name is Eric.<eos> I'm here to help you.
The people who do this work... it's a gift.<eos> Oh, and it's a curse.<eos> And it'll eat you alive if you don't deal with it.<eos> "Deal with it"?<eos> Go where it leads you.
I revered you.<eos> When you were told that my mother and I were dead, I have to believe that it affected you.<eos> You had just lost your mother.<eos> But if things were as I remember, my mother and I were your family, too.<eos> And yet, through all the years thereafter that my father cared for you... counseled you, labored for you... he never told you that we were alive.
Quickly!<eos> Careful.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Thank you.<eos> When they took you... I saw the look I used to see in the eyes of my husband.
Good.<eos> It is not every day you escape prison.<eos> Thank you again.<eos> I wouldn't be alive if you hadn't helped me.<eos> Those men who attacked you, they were hired by your brother?
- Uh-oh.<eos> I gotta go. - Wait!<eos> - Gotta help behind the counter. - No.<eos> Did they...<eos> - Love you.
- One truth! - One truth!<eos> - Our truth! - Our truth!<eos> [all chanting] One truth!<eos> Our truth!<eos> I mean, the idea of polyphonic fiction reflecting both the intercontextuality of an author's work and their life really resonated with what is happening to you.
Food, some clothes, money.<eos> I do not know how to thank you.<eos> Nothing I have done in my life exceeds the honor to have been your teacher.<eos> Sometimes, I find her staring at the gate.<eos> I know she's waiting for you.
Where did you get those?<eos> Train station.<eos> Thought we could use them to cover the windows.<eos> Confuse anyone dropping in.<eos> Have I mentioned how in love with you I am?
Have I mentioned how in love with you I am?<eos> It really isn't the same, is it?<eos> Well... it's not bad.<eos> It could be the way that older couples who've been together a long time feel like when they kiss.<eos> Yeah, I like the idea of a long life spent kissing you.
You don't have to do it if you don't feel comfortable.<eos> Yes. Absolutely.<eos> But... you're so good when you speak from your heart.<eos> Baby, the interview you did at the premiere was incredible.<eos> I think it had a lot to do with these people inviting you.
Okay. I heard that.<eos> And they're not gonna work because I'm talking inside your head.<eos> She knows.<eos> She didn't mean it literally.<eos> And you know he's only freaking out because he loves you so much.
I know I've been acting... crazy lately.<eos> I don't mean to be.<eos> - I know.<eos> - It's just...<eos> I've never loved anyone, anyone... the way that I love you.
- No. The blockers kicked in.<eos> - Good.<eos> How did you remember that?<eos> I like safes.<eos> Mandiba has made a crucial mistake underestimating you.
- Hello.<eos> [laughs] He doesn't need security. Van Damn is security.<eos> It's, as he said, a precaution.<eos> Why?<eos> Because if anything should ever happen to you, no one will ever be brave enough to stand up to Mandiba again.
I lost my agent.<eos> I lost my Instagram followers, my Twitter followers.<eos> - I've lost...<eos> - Shut up!<eos> You have a man who loves you.
- I've lost...<eos> - Shut up!<eos> You have a man who loves you.<eos> And you have a friend who was willing to give up her life for you.<eos> And you have a mother who accepts you.
I know you're angry... but this is how a girl like me tells a boy like you that she has a crush on you.<eos> And instead of laying in bed, wishing she was going out with you and not her current boyfriend... she has decided to do something about it.<eos> [Superpower] Far enough.<eos> So we meet again, eh, Van Damn?<eos> So, tell me, did that pretty girl of yours turn you on to politics?
- Just like them?<eos> They do.<eos> - You'll be fine, son.<eos> - How do you know that?<eos> Because your whole life, every really good day, and every truly bad one, has been preparing you for this moment.
Fuck.<eos> Great.<eos> I just pissed myself.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Fuck, man. I've been looking all over this fucking city for you.
I know.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I understand what you're going through.<eos> And I'm not judging, or trying to fix it, or tell you what to do.<eos> I just wanted you to know that I love you.
If you want to finish your sacred rite, get out of the way.<eos> Otherwise, I can take you downtown, too.<eos> - Teagan, be reasonable.<eos> - But...<eos> We knew this could happen. We warned you.
Thank you.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> He's never called me "daughter."<eos> - I love you.<eos> - I love you, too.
I wish I was there.<eos> Maybe I could've... protected you.<eos> You see, all those people want... is someone to keep them from what they're afraid to know.<eos> And what are the president and First Lady doing tonight, Francis?<eos> Well, I believe Thomas is waiting for you.
I don't think so.<eos> We'll lock him in the basement so he can't watch.<eos> Forget it!<eos> Absolutely no sexual activity until creepy 'Mr. fix-it' is gone.<eos> I guess I jarred you loose.
Hope you're ready for some real fun.<eos> Just give me a minute. Okay?<eos> I don't think I can wait a minute.<eos> God, the weirdest thing just happened in the bathroom.<eos> Whatever it was, it must have turned you on big time.
It's Jen that I don't get.<eos> You know, one minute she's sex-crazed and the next she's just crazed.<eos> Why don't you and I swap wives? Just for a week.<eos> - Hey, watch it! - No...<eos> I think I can help you with this.
Doubtful.<eos> Good. You're still awake.<eos> Can I help you with something, Paul?<eos> Actually you can.<eos> And I think I might be able to help you, as well.
Sorry to have to tell you.<eos> Well, we knew his fishing tackle had been found.<eos> I-I-I suppose we hoped that he had some kind of breakdown and-and wandered off somewhere.<eos> The scientific world will be looking at us, especially Russia.<eos> - I'm just telling you how it is.
Where the fuck the cameras go?<eos> They left to go home, which is what I'm gonna do.<eos> - So, excuse me.<eos> - Oh, oh, wait.<eos> Excuse you?
But the only way is with a key, and only Caputo and Piscatella have keys.<eos> No, that can't be the only way.<eos> Can't we, you know, cut some wires or something?<eos> We? Piss off, Bloody Mary.<eos> I'm not helping you.
Flores?<eos> You out there?<eos> Where's a fucking hammer when you need one?<eos> You hear that?<eos> She said she's ready to gut you like a shark that's eaten a toddler.
I mean, I think you were totally brave.<eos> You, like, fucked up your whole life so that we could be free.<eos> And I don't think no one is gonna mess with you in Max when they hear.<eos> You know how bitches gossip.<eos> Everyone gonna know you a badass.
Can you please keep this milk in your fridge?<eos> - Sure.<eos> Su!<eos> Where are you?<eos> I called you so many times!
'No problem. You can hear it now.'<eos> 'And get used to it' 'because we'll be visiting often now.'<eos> 'We will come whenever we want.'<eos> 'Come on, let's try something new today.'<eos> 'I know how hard this is for you' 'and I love you so much'
But that stops now.<eos> Now, you must stop going around with such friends.<eos> Pay attention to the campaign.<eos> We have the election in two months.<eos> If I hear about another issue involving you I will send you to Pune to sister, do you get it?
Your father went to kill Amit with a knife.<eos> Chaubey has filed an FIR.<eos> Listen to me. I've sent Amit to Pune.<eos> Now go and tell your father to withdraw the FIR.<eos> I hope you remember that I got you out in the blind woman's rape case.
I've been with you through all these phases... the music, the failed sitcom script, the communism, community board, and now you're just coasting.<eos> And I'm probably responsible.<eos> All right, you know what, Hermie?<eos> It's been a brutal fucking day.<eos> I'm not getting into this with you right now.
You know, I married your dad and thought that would be that.<eos> 30 years later, here I am alone on the edge of a cliff.<eos> And this poor baby won't even have a grandmother.<eos> - What's that supposed to mean?<eos> - Think about it, Hannah. Your grandparents took you and your cousins to Colonial Williamsburg.
Why?<eos> To tell him that you know he sent someone to kill you and you're still alive?<eos> - Basically, yes.<eos> - That's kind of dumb.<eos> I mean, wouldn't it be better to let him think that you're dead so he leaves you alone?
- Basically, yes.<eos> - That's kind of dumb.<eos> I mean, wouldn't it be better to let him think that you're dead so he leaves you alone?<eos> Mother, he is going to get out someday, and we have to deal with it.<eos> He thinks that I killed you, remember?
Business meeting, huh?<eos> For the love of God, Mother, what are you doing here?<eos> I could just as easily ask you that question.<eos> Mother, I am not the one who's supposed to be dead.<eos> I mean, what if someone saw you in here?
You have all these brilliant ideas that only find life on the page.<eos> I'm a writer, John.<eos> I fail to see how that makes me a coward.<eos> All you do is write!<eos> It's the only release your fear grants you.
- I have to cut it. - No way.<eos> Don't mention my hair or my job interview.<eos> I can help you with that.<eos> I'm a hairdresser now!<eos> No, seriously, I know of a job that might interest you.
Carlos, sit down.<eos> Your mother and I want to talk to you.<eos> Vazquez called.<eos> We know you haven't been in class for two weeks.<eos> Did we put any pressure on you to study law?
- My God!<eos> - Look at their faces!<eos> - You see?<eos> They're looking at us.<eos> And here's the secret door I told you about. This leads to the bedrooms.
I was very sick, I had a fever.<eos> Dad had just left and you were very angry.<eos> You told me that I should never marry until I was economically independent.<eos> I don't know if it was because of the fever but I was really scared,<eos> and I told you that I couldn't live if you died.
I needed to say goodbye properly.<eos> I'm going to the village.<eos> My mother is separated.<eos> I wanted you to know that you're the best thing that ever happened to me.<eos> And that I'm very sorry that I hurt you.
I think I'll always love you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's true.<eos> Until a good dick appears.<eos> I think I did it to try to forget you, and so you'd forget me.
We're both in for almost 30 goddamn years!<eos> Some asshole, they took money.<eos> Can't find anything!<eos> I love you, Caleb.<eos> I love you too, Norma Louise.
Mm.<eos> That's not my role here.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I don't feel that I have the authority to act in that manner.<eos> This is between you and Norma, and what happens to you now, it's up to Norma, and I'm just an observer.
True crime.<eos> ♪ ♪<eos> Hi, sweetie.<eos> What happened?<eos> Chick put you in my bed.
♪ ♪<eos> Hi, sweetie.<eos> What happened?<eos> Chick put you in my bed.<eos> He found you passed out in the basement.
It's Koch with a K.<eos> Papa, this is Mama. Hold position, do not engage. Say again.<eos> He just took two down.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Who sent you?
I told you, don't worry about me.<eos> It's not happening, buddy.<eos> No can do. Four years undercover with these bastards. I know how they think.<eos> All right. Motel Biscayne, Route 202, Junction 7.<eos> Okay. Give me five hours. I'll call you when I'm 30 minutes out.
Come with me!<eos> Here, drink this.<eos> It's turmeric milk.<eos> Sister..<eos> I've raised you like my daughter.
"The auspicious day is here, come, the courtyard is decorated."<eos> "I met my soulmate. Congratulate me for that."<eos> "He'll come to me with a wedding procession."<eos> "I met my soulmate."<eos> What had I stolen from you that you stole Phillauri from me?
It's right there on the invitation.<eos> Come on, Bones, this is a big one.<eos> You're turning 40.<eos> You're flipping the old odometer.<eos> I can assure you that I have everything I need.
From me impacting the ground.<eos> Look, I was there, Red.<eos> I saw what happened, you landed on your right side.<eos> All right?<eos> The fracture came when Felbeck hit you with his cane.
You are faster, stronger, and smarter than him.<eos> How could you be so weak?<eos> How would you let that man outplay you?<eos> That's what happened, Olivia.<eos> He outplayed you in the generals, and he outplayed you tonight when he paid an assassin to shoot Frankie Vargas!
People are trying to work.<eos> Charlie, Quinn doesn't want to go to the Caribbean with you because she's a workaholic<eos> - and she's afraid of the ocean.<eos> - I am not.<eos> Quinn, Charlie wants to take you to the Caribbean so he can propose to you.
You don't know a damn thing about Yemen.<eos> I'll find someone who does.<eos> See ya, Mikey.<eos> _<eos> I envy you.
Have a good day.<eos> What the hell was that for?<eos> Sucre, what the hell are you doing here?<eos> C-Note told me what's going on.<eos> He tell you to talk me out of it?
Listen, lady. Trust doesn't seem to mean a whole lot in this country.<eos> Give me a second, okay?<eos> I'll figure out a way to work this thing out.<eos> An image.<eos> Right? The one that they sent to you?
Noel's dead, but Jenna's still out there.<eos> - I mean, we have to find her.<eos> - We will.<eos> But I'm not taking any chances with you.<eos> The last time I let you out of my sight
- You should have called me.<eos> - It's my nightmare, not yours.<eos> So, how was it, the doctor?<eos> Humiliating.<eos> What did she tell you?
It's gonna depend a great deal in the next few minutes.<eos> - Mary Drake.<eos> - Where is she?<eos> She's temporarily unaccounted for.<eos> What did she tell you?
Close by.<eos> Hi.<eos> Five minutes.<eos> You were in this world five minutes before I first held you.<eos> And I've been holding on to you ever since.
I am your mother.<eos> You know that.<eos> I don't know anything!<eos> Everything that I thought I knew, everything it just came from the big bag of lies!<eos> Honey, Mary Drake will never bother you again.
Have the boss lady call me, and we'll work out the details.<eos> - My boss?<eos> - Mona.<eos> She has a real eye for talent.<eos> You're so lucky she found you.
So you swap people away like they are bugs.<eos> Please.<eos> Just go away.<eos> That's what you want me to do?<eos> God, Ali why do we have to keep showing you that we love you?
What are you doing here?<eos> This is my sister's business.<eos> She needed a brilliant but affordable chef.<eos> - Mary Drake.<eos> - What did she tell you?
We could stop and have a nice lunch...<eos> Who was on the phone?<eos> Was it dad?<eos> How long is he gonna put off coming home to face me?<eos> Honey, your father's not avoiding you.
Well, I don't see why it matters now.<eos> You've got the ring.<eos> So why does he keep putting it off?<eos> She still doesn't even know that we're engaged.<eos> Is Ezra the only person who's ever told you he loved you?
Hackett knows what Alison and I have been through.<eos> Everyone in this town does.<eos> No one's gonna let her subvert a hug into...<eos> It's not about that picture.<eos> She's accused you of hitting on her.
Could you take Ms. Marshall to the conference room?<eos> I'll join you shortly.<eos> Do you wanna see a real sociopath?<eos> Because you have one walking into your conference room right now.<eos> Spencer, the bullet that hit you did not match the gun that Jenna was holding.
Hey, good morning.<eos> - Who are you talking to?<eos> - Uh, nobody.<eos> I really have to go, though, okay?<eos> I'll, I'll call you right back.
I know you're confused and you're hurt.<eos> I still can't explain what I did but as big as a mistake as it was and, Spencer, it was huge, I know that.<eos> I don't regret what happened because we ended up with you.<eos> You are our daughter.<eos> We love you so much.
It's just the first time that I have said it all out loud.<eos> When's your appointment?<eos> I take the first pill at the clinic this weekend.<eos> And the next one at home a few days later.<eos> Can I take you to the clinic?
This what gave her palpitations.<eos> It's not mine. I designed this when I was working for Claudia.<eos> "Dearest, it wasn't supposed to be this way.<eos> I did what I did because people like my sister and the Hastings deserve to be punished."<eos> The bullet that hit you did not match the gun that Jenna was holding.
Well, my guess is they're in communication.<eos> So we use Sydney to track down Jenna.<eos> And how do we do that?<eos> Just say "Pretty, please tell us where Jenna went?"<eos> Well, if I run you through some Bluesnarf basics we can get what we need through Sydney's cellphone.
Well, she ran this place for decades.<eos> She was special.<eos> To everyone who walked through that door.<eos> Including a shy kid with glasses.<eos> Hmm. I can't really picture you as shy.
What is your emergency? - Hi!<eos> Um, m-m-my, my friend is having trouble breathing.<eos> Please, this is an emergency!<eos> Here.<eos> Let me help you with that...
You may wanna wait for me to ask the question first.<eos> That's enough for now, Barry.<eos> You okay?<eos> Sort of like setting fire to my house and then asking if I'm too warm.<eos> Spencer, I can't help you unless you tell me the truth.
I was giving a voice to a ghost.<eos> But now, Nicole can speak for herself and I don't feel comfortable answering questions about her.<eos> It just doesn't feel right not having you there.<eos> I will be there.<eos> Sitting front row and cheering you on.
Hanna, stop pacing.<eos> Well, how do you know it's not going to explode once you hook it up?<eos> It's not going to explode.<eos> Well, it was sent from A.D.<eos> It might explode, it might poison you and it might poke you in the eye with a box cutter.
- Mom.<eos> Just tell me.<eos> I have never seen you like this.<eos> What're you talking about?<eos> I'm always trying to help you.
Why?<eos> Mom, you've spent your whole life helping me.<eos> Doing things you shouldn't have had to do.<eos> Because I love you.<eos> And now it's time for me to show you how much I love you by not letting you get involved.
So, I've been thinking.<eos> The game has to connect to the Internet and it does that with an IP address which is like a phone number.<eos> I'm writing a program right now to search the cell towers in Rosewood.<eos> When the game connects, I might be able to find his location.<eos> No wonder they call you "Too genius, too furious."
Did something happen?<eos> Tanner happened.<eos> She called me in for questioning.<eos> - Um, how are you doing? - Um...<eos> - I haven't seen you since...
So far, nothing.<eos> Do you remember when these used to be our phones?<eos> Like, a million years ago?<eos> There was so much less to worry about.<eos> I'm really sorry that I involved you in this mess.
And it made me think.<eos> Spencer, I'm so sorry.<eos> I know you are.<eos> And I wish that I could forgive you, but...<eos> I might have misjudged you.
Your friend's getting her belongings back.<eos> - What?<eos> - Why?<eos> I just received proof that you were not in Rosewood on the night that Dunhill disappeared.<eos> A redlight cam caught you fullfrontal in Keene, New Hampshire.
Most of which I am not happy about.<eos> And tomorrow it's gonna be all hands on deck.<eos> I've already got a call into a new lawyer and I...<eos> But tonight...<eos> I'm just gonna be happy that you have found a man who loves you and wants to protect you.
I'm sorry, Aria.<eos> We all are.<eos> - It's okay.<eos> - No, it's not okay.<eos> We didn't have the right to shut you out like that.
I-I don't know how to say it, so, um...<eos> That man was a police detective, and he told me your moth... your mother's dead.<eos> What?<eos> I know. I know.<eos> But I'm gonna take you somewhere safe, where those people that are trying to hurt you can't reach you.
And they're trying to hurt me...<eos> Take the one thing that I truly love away.<eos> Why would they try and hurt you?<eos> Because there are some things I haven't told you about me.<eos> I sent that letter to you for a reason.
The reason those people are after me... I know this is gonna be hard to believe, but I'm basically a secret agent.<eos> Come on in.<eos> You know that fort you've got in the backyard?<eos> It feels good to go somewhere like that, right?<eos> A place no one knows about, where no one can get to you.
- Nice to meet you.<eos> - Nice to meet you.<eos> Sorry, who would ditch you? I don't...<eos> I can't make the connection right now.<eos> Who would humiliate you?
Sex never meant anything to me.<eos> Okay?<eos> And things are so different with you, and...<eos> I don't know, I guess I've never been with somebody that I loved before.<eos> I love you too, Ali.
It was horrible.<eos> There was so much blood and...<eos> - Oh, my God. Hey, baby, come here.<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I'm so lucky I have you.
Come on now. Just a few more steps.<eos> Ravi.<eos> Always working' late.<eos> Oh, my office?<eos> I could take you to your apartment, Liv.
Oh, you didn't mind last time we mixed business with pleasure.<eos> You pay me for information, and I have quite a bit to share.<eos> As predicted, Klaus' enemies are flocking to New Orleans to celebrate.<eos> However, some are seeking allies among your witches.<eos> No doubt they want to befriend the very covens that still resent you, start conflict, undermine your power, and perhaps steal your prize trophy.
Is that her?<eos> Let me check.<eos> Stay inside.<eos> Well, now, aren't you a sight?<eos> You're sure no one followed you?
Say you're sorry.<eos> Now.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - It's okay.<eos> Maxine, let me help you with that.
Hey... come with me to Arkadia.<eos> I'm serious, Emori, ok? We can be together there.<eos> My people will protect you.<eos> Are you sure about that?<eos> How many times have they cast you out?
I'm sorry, Bellamy.<eos> What is it?<eos> Do you know what I said about being safe with my people?<eos> Your plan was better. Let's go.<eos> Before you say anything, remember, I saved your life by taking you out of Mount Weather.
You haven't been home in more than 3 years.<eos> You act as if that was my choice.<eos> Of course it wasn't.<eos> You were a bargaining chip.<eos> It almost broke your mother to send you away.
Momma, no.<eos> Get that door shut!<eos> Help me!<eos> I thought you were dead.<eos> I was watching you for a long time.
I mean, it's pretty.<eos> Dad and Susan are gonna kick me out, or drag me to that treatment.<eos> - Okay, so eat.<eos> - I eat.<eos> You know that I love you like a full sister, but you look like absolute crap.
And I'm guessing you like that.<eos> But the way that you're going, one day, you won't wake up.<eos> And I'm not going to treat you if you aren't interested in living.<eos> Good speech.<eos> If I'm going to help you, you have to agree to a few things.
- I've never really liked it.<eos> - So, change it.<eos> I can't just change it.<eos> I can't, right?<eos> Just tell people to call you by a different name.
- Yes.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - No charge.<eos> - Oh, my God, we're going to hell.<eos> - Did he try to kiss you?
- Where is Luke, anyway?<eos> - He's at the doctor for his knee.<eos> Eli?<eos> Eli.<eos> What's going on with you?
Why we live, why Megan lost the baby, why that girl killed herself.<eos> - You're not reassuring me, doctor.<eos> - I can't reassure you.<eos> This idea you have that there's a way to be safe... it's childish and cowardly.<eos> It stops you from experiencing anything, including anything good.
Hi, Mom.<eos> - Is this all you've got?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> All right.<eos> Well, everybody's waiting for you.
I'm sorry.<eos> And...<eos> I just want you to know that... I accept it if...<eos> If death is what you want, I accept it now.<eos> I accept it, but um... I love you.
Kaniel Outis, worked with the rebels.<eos> - His name's Michael Scofield.<eos> - I don't care!<eos> Not Kaniel Outis!<eos> There's nothing you can say to me that will make me help you, okay?
If you think I'm going into the suburbs, you're crazy.<eos> What's wrong with the suburbs?<eos> The suburbs are out there.<eos> The front line of the war.<eos> Nice knowing you, Benjamin.
My ace in the hole.<eos> Yeah, sure, okay.<eos> See, in game theory, it serves you to be two-faced.<eos> Be everyone's friend till the moment you're not.<eos> You make them love you so much that when they're up against it, their loyalty will make them act against their own best interests.
Was it also a misunderstanding when you tried to escape the moment you got into this prison? Hmm?<eos> An honest man doesn't try to escape.<eos> He asks for a lawyer.<eos> But you, you tried to escape the very first week.<eos> I'd have left you in solitary forever if it was up to me.
But even if it is just within these walls, the law of the land is still in place.<eos> The law of God supersedes the law of this corrupt land.<eos> We will not be reduced to animals.<eos> Amazing you still trust him.<eos> He will use you for the escape and he will leave you.
He is an opportunist.<eos> He will use whoever he needs.<eos> He has told you something about the escape.<eos> I know he has. You were in the cell with him.<eos> You. You tell me, so I can help you, before he uses you to get that devil out and we are all left here to die.
Maybe even tomorrow.<eos> I'm putting you in danger by saying this, but maybe it doesn't matter because I'll be dead, and they'll leave you alone.<eos> But I love you.<eos> You see, I loved you.<eos> I never stopped loving you.
Hey, I'm talking to you!<eos> Annalise had nothing to do with this.<eos> Of course she did.<eos> She loved that kid.<eos> No, she told you to be a good little soldier and take the fall for her.
Seriously.<eos> Release me, call a public defender to get you off my back, but I'm done being interrogated.<eos> You hear me?<eos> Done.<eos> Yo, what this weave set you back?
What is it?<eos> You can fix this.<eos> Give me all your 9s.<eos> Go fish.<eos> What the hell happened to you?
If I don't smother that gun, they'll kill us all.<eos> Move back!<eos> Move back!<eos> Go! Let me through!<eos> Poseidon sent you?
I don't doubt your emotions are real... but what's the point of all the sad faces and the gnashing of teeth?<eos> If you're not going to change your behavior, and you won't...<eos> - I can change...<eos> - why not just skip the whole exercise?<eos> In the end, you're gonna hurt everyone around you.
We shouldn't even be talking about this.<eos> Get off me!<eos> How are you alive? !<eos> In Yemen? !<eos> What happened to you, Michael? !
We'll be there.<eos> We got to move.<eos> Sid...<eos> Sid! I heard your call, infidel.<eos> Wings will not carry you to safety.
He's poisoned.<eos> Michael?<eos> Your ex, Michael?<eos> Yeah. Wait, hold on a second, he really is alive?<eos> He contacted you just now?
Papi,you'realive?<eos> The skipper is a corrupt bastard.<eos> He's got guns in the hold, all kinds of contraband.<eos> Captain.<eos> Here's the cargo I was telling you about.
Thanks, Papi.<eos> What about you, Linc?<eos> I think Linc's got a secret girlfriend, the pilot lady.<eos> She's not my lady.<eos> Maybe Sucre will set you up with one of his sex dolls.
- How do you know?<eos> - That text.<eos> She referred to our son as Junior.<eos> We agreed we'd never call him that.<eos> He's baiting you, Michael.
A man drawn into this by destiny.<eos> Okay. How about you take off?<eos> I don't exactly cotton to strange men coming up to me in the middle of the night, you know?<eos> Only one person calls me Whip... you ain't him.<eos> Nobody calls you that.
RReykj...<eos> Once we win the race and you become Primo, we can use the prize money, and we can travel anywhere we want.<eos> Dear.<eos> This is awkward, now, isn't it?<eos> I wasn't inviting you.
- What of it?<eos> I spoke with my partner.<eos> Heart Enterprises owns Kane Hill Hospital.<eos> What?<eos> The same people that put you on the race own the asylum where your sister is living.
Get down!<eos> - You're shot.<eos> - What?<eos> Well, that's disappointing.<eos> Oh, I'll take you to the med bay.
All hands, make ready for descent.<eos> I reinforced all the seals to the machine shop.<eos> Soon as we're done here, we're onto the next deck.<eos> Okay.<eos> Amos. About what I did to you on Ganymede.
Amos.<eos> It's just that I've been...<eos> I've been trying to make choices on my own lately, and I can't seem to make the right ones.<eos> No one's always right.<eos> I'm sorry I hurt you.
Oh, thank God.<eos> But you haven't locked me out yet.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Because as soon as you do...<eos> There's nothing to keep you from beating me to death.
And remember, even if it feels good, she's not the solution.<eos> - Jeanie. - Hey.<eos> Hey, we missed you the other night.<eos> Oh, yeah, I was bummed I couldn't make it.<eos> I'm shocked the "desperate housewives" kept you out so late.
Yeah, well, I'm figuring it out.<eos> I can't believe I'm gonna miss it.<eos> I'm slammed at the office.<eos> What?<eos> Well, we'll wait for you.
Tell me what I can do.<eos> Help me track Jace.<eos> I want to use our rune.<eos> I just need your magic for the pain.<eos> - I can't help you with this. - Why not?
They took me in, they trained me.<eos> If anyone's my parents, they are.<eos> I had no choice, Jonathan.<eos> My enemies were closing in.<eos> I sent you to a place where I knew you would be cared for.
No.<eos> All you've ever done is lie to me.<eos> You told me I never had a mother.<eos> What did you want me to say?<eos> That I saved you and that your mother deserted you?
All you've ever done is lie to me.<eos> You told me I never had a mother.<eos> What did you want me to say?<eos> That I saved you and that your mother deserted you?<eos> - She left you to die in Idris.
- She left you to die in Idris.<eos> Why would she do that?<eos> Because you're different.<eos> You're special.<eos> Look, I know that you have always felt more powerful than everyone else around you.
I'm a warlock, too.<eos> These men are using you for your abilities.<eos> He said Nana was here.<eos> He lied.<eos> I wanna help you, Madzie.
Please let this work.<eos> Jace, don't!<eos> The mortal cup is still out there.<eos> He's the only one who knows where it is.<eos> You're gonna wish you were dead After the clave gets through with you. Jace.
Magnus, on every mission I've ever been on, I've never felt that type of fear, ever.<eos> Not knowing if you were alive or dead. I...<eos> So was I.<eos> Magnus... I love you.<eos> I love you, too.
What's your problem?<eos> Sebastian Verlac shows up out of the blue and saves you?<eos> What are you trying to say?<eos> Alec, you did everything you could to help me.<eos> And I love you for that.
Something that couldn't be undone.<eos> Hey. You're OK.<eos> - You wanted to see us?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I told you I would decide what was next for you once Azazel was vanquished, so here we are.
Sorry.<eos> After all the abuse Valentine put me through...<eos> I'm still not strong enough to create portals.<eos> You know, you really should let go of your anger.<eos> I'd hate to see something bad happen to you because of it.
Try again.<eos> I can't make it work.<eos> Yes, you can.<eos> You can do the honours.<eos> Tell me what it feels like to have your entire family ripped away from you.
Feel it!<eos> You try to stall... with a flick of my finger, Jace dies.<eos> Your mother is never coming back.<eos> Your father will never love you.<eos> The only reason he wanted you was to use you.
Now I know where that bold defiance of yours comes from.<eos> You're just like your father.<eos> I... retrieved this from Magnus's apartment.<eos> It belongs to you now.<eos> You've had a lot taken away from you, Jace.
Have you heard anything?<eos> No, but warlocks don't report their misdeeds to me.<eos> If they did, my phone would never stop ringing.<eos> Magnus, I need your hair.<eos> It's just a strand for a DNA test to clear you.
Do you want that blood on your hands?<eos> Get out of here.<eos> [sighs] What happened?<eos> You were drugged.<eos> Fortunately, Simon got to you before it was too late.
Make me proud.<eos> Clary, there's no perfect way to do this.<eos> I'm doing my best.<eos> You know, not too long ago, everyone thought you had demon blood.<eos> If you weren't a Herondale, she'd be locking you up, too.
-You're incredibly beautiful, Dot. -[chuckles]<eos> And soulful.<eos> Generous.<eos> But I'm afraid I've always been a... one-soul-at-a-time kind of guy.<eos> Alec's lucky to have you.
♪ I'm a stranger when I wake Wake up in your eyes ♪<eos> ♪ When the world I've come to know ♪<eos> ♪ Is a replica ♪<eos> ♪ Forever alone ♪<eos> [Jace] Hey, hey, let me help you.
♪ When the world I've come to know ♪<eos> ♪ Is a replica ♪<eos> ♪ Forever alone ♪<eos> [Jace] Hey, hey, let me help you.<eos> [Maia] I appreciate you springing me, but there's still a bar full of Downworlders who might want to gut you.
Well, why does the Legion of Doom<eos> - want the medallion?<eos> - "Legion of Doom"?<eos> - Yeah. - Don't ask.<eos> Well, according to legend, the medallion calls for the spear and basically takes you right to it.
- Two of them are.<eos> - You're one of them.<eos> Help!<eos> Listen to me, all right? Calm down.<eos> We're here to help you.
- Well, where is it?<eos> - In the movie?<eos> It... It's in pieces.<eos> Rip just has a fragment of it.<eos> What inspired you to write it that way?
I've seen how pathetic you are.<eos> In this future that you're from, do I at least have two hands?<eos> Either way, I intend to change my future, but look at you now.<eos> You're pathetic.<eos> I don't even know why Thawne recruited you in the first place.
No, I'm... I'm the one who's sorry.<eos> For what?<eos> It's not your fault I'm a mistake.<eos> Uh, I've made many mistakes in my life, Lily, but you... most certainly are not one of them.<eos> The apology that I owe you is for not telling you about the unique circumstances of your conception.
I will give you a day.<eos> MOONEY: I thought we were friends.<eos> When the Court of Owls calls, o-one does not refuse.<eos> Still, I'm not upset.<eos> I knew when your old masters summoned you, it was to cook up some horror, and here's the thing:
ALFRED: Right. Find Bullock, let him know where we are.<eos> I'm gonna follow Bruce.<eos> MALE VOICE:<eos> You know who I am?<eos> MALE VOICE: Who do you think told the Sensei to send you here?
But I need to know if you're ready.<eos> I am. The Sensei trained me.<eos> Are you?<eos> He set you a task.<eos> He asked you to be the one that released the virus that now envelops this city.
If it wasn't for her,<eos> Gordon would have turned me over, and I'd most likely be dead.<eos> But fortune favors the bold.<eos> You said you called them after you knocked me out.<eos> You knew that I'd bring you here.
I created Flashpoint and changed everything.<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - Savitar.<eos> The god of speed.<eos> You said that I trapped you in the future. Where?
I know who you are.<eos> I am the future Flash.<eos> When I have control of all of time, it will be you who is abandoned and forgotten!<eos> And I only need for Iris to die so that you are driven so far into the dark that I can be born.<eos> I'm gonna stop you.
Get her.<eos> - We can't outrun them.<eos> - No, we can't.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm the reason Savitar found you.
Make me what I need.<eos> And I will let you both go.<eos> I hated Thawne... and Zoom.<eos> They took so much from me.<eos> And I've hated Savitar for threatening to take you away from me too.
You need them, right?<eos> To pull off your grand ascension.<eos> Look, Barry, if I wanted to talk to myself, I could have done that, back at my lair.<eos> What... do you want?<eos> I wanna help you.
I just wish the legends could everybody we wanted.<eos> What happened?<eos> What'd I miss?<eos> We'll talk about it later.<eos> The important thing is that you're back which they brought you back from and they just dropped you here.
Think?<eos> I might need some more time with it.<eos> The circuitry's pretty complex,<eos> I'm feeling a lot of pressure,<eos> Felicity can come with and help you. Hold up.
Let me help you dispose of yurievich, then you will hear me out with what I have to say.<eos> At the very least, you'll be dealing a major blow to your enemy.<eos> Oh, thank God.<eos> You are a lifesaver.<eos> Yeah. Well, I figure you got to get your share of fast-food before they lock you up in lompoc for hacking the NSA.
My real name is Dinah, Dinah Drake.<eos> Dinah?<eos> Does that name mean something to you?<eos> I had a friend named Dinah.<eos> She's the reason I sought you out.
I'll see you on the boat.<eos> I know where he's taking them.<eos> The name of the island they found me on is Lian Yu.<eos> It's mandarin for Purgatory.<eos> What brought you back to the island?
He got me to kill my friend's sister.<eos> I--how can you miss somebody that you have hated so much?<eos> Yeah. I mean, I have some experience with evil dads, too.<eos> My father abandoned me, lied to me, and then took a bullet for me, saving my life.<eos> Malcolm was not a good person, and he was an even worse father, but in his own way, he loved you.
Yeah, you could say that.<eos> There's hundreds.<eos> Way too many to defuse.<eos> All right. Let's get out of here.<eos> I think Wilson did something to your head when he knocked you out.
Do it.<eos> Father would have wanted you to.<eos> You're late.<eos> But they're not.<eos> He was only pretending to screw with you?
Or everyone else.<eos> You choose.<eos> Right now.<eos> Either way, it proves me right, huh?<eos> Either way, it's exactly like I told you.
Either way, it's exactly like I told you.<eos> Everyone around you, everything you touch dies.<eos> William, come here, come here!<eos> Hey! Are you ok? Are you all right?<eos> Are you all right? Did he hurt you?
I'm--I'm on a boat.<eos> I love you, and...<eos> And I'm coming home, ok?<eos> Ohh! I love you!<eos> Oh, Oliver, I love you so much.
I have you and Daddy.<eos> And that's more than enough.<eos> Now let's go to sleep.<eos> - I love you.<eos> - I love you, too, Mommy.
It's good.<eos> Salty.<eos> Slurpy.<eos> Naw, I'm not hungry, but I'm gonna grab a beer and come join you.<eos> So, Grace, what brings you by?
Absolutely.<eos> Good.<eos> - Good night. - Good night.<eos> - Love you.<eos> - Love you, too.
If you help us build a case against your pimp, we're gonna put him behind bars.<eos> You're really lucky that Seth got you into G.U.<eos> - Daddy, it's me, Diamond.<eos> I love you.<eos> - I love you, too, a'ight?
Listen.<eos> Listen, Callie, I want you to wipe your fingerprints off of it first, okay?<eos> - Okay.<eos> - I love you, baby.<eos> I love you, too.
- What?<eos> No.<eos> Uh, h... he's just mad because I... didn't fill up the car when I used it last.<eos> Uh... don't say anything to anybody about what you told me earlier.<eos> - What did she tell you?
What's up?<eos> So when did you stop taking your anti-seizure meds?<eos> So your mama and I have discussed the legal strategy with your lawyers, and they think that using the DNA report and Aaron's testimony... can only strengthen your case, but only to establish your state of mind in the car, that at the time,<eos> you thought Troy had killed Martha.<eos> They still want you to say that Kyle manipulated you and that you now believe he was rightly convicted.
You used me.<eos> - For what?<eos> - For a cause.<eos> To... to feel good about yourself.<eos> I could go to prison because I tried to help you.
-You asked favor of him.<eos> He asked favor in return, and you pull gun on him instead?<eos> You know why I can't be some Bratva thug.<eos> You made promise.<eos> You swore oath, and now one of your brothers is dead, so why should I welcome you as brother?
Your past is a part of you.<eos> There is nothing you can do about that.<eos> You can't change it.<eos> It doesn't mean it has to be your anchor.<eos> The other names in that book are waiting for you, Oliver.
We can kill him.<eos> You are my brother, Oliver.<eos> Oleg said that you needed to tell me something.<eos> It can wait.<eos> You know, if visiting Star City's sister city is what it took to get you to bed,
I would have bought you a ticket to Russia months ago.<eos> A friend of mine told me that my...<eos> My past doesn't have to be my anchor, and I think my past is what was... Stopping me from moving things forward with you.<eos> Looking at all this, I can understand why.<eos> What exactly happened to you on that island anyway?
Not now.<eos> Maybe someday.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I can wait for someday.<eos> Hey. What'd that bag ever do to you, huh?
Didn't you put China White in prison, like, forever ago?<eos> Yeah.<eos> A couple times.<eos> Why does she look so familiar?<eos> Maybe she arrested you once.
Yeah? You and what army?<eos> This one!<eos> It's amazing the loyalty money can buy.<eos> Take them down.<eos> I'm gonna enjoy watching them take you down.
I still don't know how this got leaked.<eos> We know how it got leaked.<eos> It's Prometheus.<eos> He sent the ACU after me as the Green Arrow, and now he's coming after me as the mayor.<eos> Something he set you up for in the first place.
Yeah. That seems to be going around lately.<eos> So you got Oliver's girlfriend fired?<eos> He told you?<eos> Of course he told you.<eos> Well, did he also tell you it was a mistake,
Who's most in our corner?<eos> Pollard, believe it or not.<eos> That's not surprising.<eos> She can't call in the marker I owe her for helping with gun reform if I'm impeached.<eos> I'll touch base with her, see if I can get her to call you to testify in your own defense, ok?
It's politics.<eos> There's about to be a vote, so it's time to play hardball.<eos> This isn't hardball.<eos> This is cruel.<eos> What would be cruel is the people of the city not having you as the mayor.
I'm listening.<eos> All right.<eos> Copy that.<eos> Vigilante is across the street, sixth floor.<eos> He's gonna take you out as soon as you walk outside into the open.
I'm sorry. Sorry.<eos> We were stopping an assassination.<eos> Can you believe I stopped an assassination?<eos> So, um, on the way over here, I rehearsed what I would say to you...<eos> Heh... how I would win you back, tell you I love you, and all I just started with was definitely not how I planned on opening.
I mean, she definitely needs your help...<eos> But?<eos> But, Felicity, we gave you Pandora.<eos> We helped you sort through that data pull, and now, well, people are starting to ask what you're doing for us.<eos> I mean, we didn't invite you in just so you could check items off your to-do list. Sorry.
It means Kovar is planning something very big and very terrible.<eos> What is he gonna do?<eos> Oliver, maybe time is best for you to go back to America.<eos> Anatoly, we're brothers.<eos> What's happening to you is happening to me.
We stop Kovar from retrieving it.<eos> Seeing you take bullet out of Gregor, I saw him again-- the face of the monster.<eos> This place, it's not good for you, Oliver.<eos> Go home.<eos> I didn't save you from Gregor to stand by while you're murdered by Kovar.
I'm not gonna fight her.<eos> I don't want you to fight her.<eos> I want you to kill her.<eos> I'm gonna leave now.<eos> When I come back, either she's killed you and I let her go or you kill her and I let you go.
You don't kill because you have to.<eos> So why?<eos> I wanted to!<eos> And I liked it!<eos> We're gonna get this son of a bitch for whatever he did to you.
This wasn't you, Oliver.<eos> It was him.<eos> Well, I...<eos> I created him.<eos> And I know that that might sound weird, but, this happened to you because of me.
A piece of cloth could contain the monster inside of me forever.<eos> You were right.<eos> Such a burden, always being right.<eos> Life has no secrets.<eos> I should've listened to you back then.
The Oliver I know would never let a group of dangerous criminals crawl into his city, let them steal medicine.<eos> You don't know what kind of man I am.<eos> What?<eos> !<eos> What the hell did Chase do to you, Oliver?
!<eos> What the hell did Chase do to you, Oliver?<eos> Whatever it was, he m... he messed with your head in a way I didn't think was possible.<eos> Look at me, man.<eos> I could help you.
and that's because I know the kind of man you are, Oliver.<eos> The good, the bad, and the ugly I know, and you don't need to punish yourself or isolate yourself, but what you need to do is stop pushing me away because I'm not going anywhere, Oliver!<eos> Do you get that?<eos> What do you want me to do, John?<eos> I've told you what I am, who I am, and even if you don't believe it, I do.
The person that I knew would never betray a friend, would never threaten innocent people over what?<eos> A payday.<eos> When I left Russia, I was convinced that you could lead the Bratva, that you could set them on a better path, and now look at you.<eos> You're no better than Gregor.<eos> I told you, I was worried about what I would become without your help.
Your connection to the Green Arrow and his team, it's a liability.<eos> Yeah. Well, once we get Chase, he'll see all the good Helix can do.<eos> I'm sorry, but we just can't risk it, especially not with Cayden back in the fold and Argus looking for him.<eos> I loved getting to work with you.<eos> Meeting your heroes, it turns out it's not so bad after all, but we left something for you.
I know that they gave you a sense of belonging that I haven't-- no.<eos> You didn't back my play.<eos> I--I was worried.<eos> You don't trust me.<eos> After all these years, all of the times that I supported you, even when I didn't agree, you couldn't do the same for me.
You're holding someone with no lawyer, no trial.<eos> The woman I love could never do this.<eos> Lyla, this job has changed you.<eos> You didn't back my play.<eos> All of the times that I supported you, you couldn't do the same for me.
It's a proprietary alloy developed by the U.S. government to repel nuclear blasts.<eos> So you're saying even if we had a nuke down here, it wouldn't work?<eos> Seems like Cisco did such a good job of turning this place into an impenetrable fortress, he turned it into an impenetrable death trap.<eos> Chase doesn't want to kill me, remember?<eos> Yeah. He just locked you down here for the fun of it.
So sorry to interrupt.<eos> There's a problem at the bunker.<eos> I can get us out of here by climbing up the levator shaft.<eos> If you can think about going up the elevator,<eos> Chase has already thought of a way to stop you. So you're saying it's booby-trapped?
"You know, we were so happy together." - Were.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Past tense. Yes.<eos> - Look.<eos> I know that he hurt you by not telling you about his son, but...
Yeah.<eos> Oliver, you said that I don't know the kind of man that you are.<eos> I wouldn't have fallen in love with you or wanted to marry you if I didn't know exactly the kind of man that you are.<eos> Chase tortured you for a week.<eos> You're the toughest person I know, but anyone... anyone would have admitted to being a tap-dancing flamingo after what he put you through.
Chase tortured you for a week.<eos> You're the toughest person I know, but anyone... anyone would have admitted to being a tap-dancing flamingo after what he put you through.<eos> Adrian Chase... didn't make me a killer.<eos> No. 5 years in hell did that, 5 years dealing with the city's worst did that.<eos> You have spent a decade dealing with horrors that most people don't even realize exist, and the fact that that didn't turn you into a monster proves exactly the kind of person that you are.
I think I got the tiniest taste of what you've been through, the tiniest.<eos> Hmm. I get it now.<eos> I understand...<eos> Why you lied to me about William, why you had to.<eos> I get it, and for the extent that I judged you... and I did judge you...
I just weathered a scandal.<eos> I need to get out in front of this one.<eos> Ok, well, I think you should reconsider doing this whole press conference.<eos> Why?<eos> Because this could be what Chase is manipulating you into just like he manipulated you into the impeachment by throwing Green Arrow under the bus.
You can right my wrongs.<eos> You can be better than I was.<eos> You can save this city.<eos> Heh! No pressure or anything.<eos> Is this the video you said your father left for you?
And of course this is what Chase wants.<eos> Chase wants to destroy the basis for everything that we're doing here.<eos> And that crusade began with my father.<eos> Everything that I've done-- everything-- has in some way been about honoring him.<eos> Your father inspired you to save this city.
And deprive the other people who got here on time their right to a fair hearing?<eos> Due to a failure to appear, Mr. Ramirez's motion to restore parental rights is hereby denied.<eos> Hello, Thea.<eos> If you're seeing this, then chances are that I'm...gone.<eos> No matter what's happened, no matter what you've heard, I wanted you to know how much I love you.
- What?<eos> You got to leave the city, you got to leave the state, and you can't tell me where you're going.<eos> Oliver, we're not leaving.<eos> We're not going anywhere.<eos> We're not abandoning you.
A little while ago, I worried to John...<eos> That the personal connections that I had were making me vulnerable because as long as there are people in my life that I care for,<eos> I have to be something else to protect them.<eos> That's something that I can't leave in the past.<eos> I admire you, Oliver.
Don't.<eos> I'm sorry that I have to, but it's better for everyone.<eos> This is--this is the only way to make sure...<eos> That I d--I don't infect everyone that I love.<eos> But we love you in return for it, Ollie.
Too many of the wrong people know where you live.<eos> You stay out of sight till we find out what's going on.<eos> You guys head back to the precinct.<eos> See what you can find.<eos> We'll call you when we know something.
Renard wants you dead.<eos> We just got back to the precinct.<eos> He's got an APB out on you with a shoot-to-kill order.<eos> He's blaming what happened at North Precinct on you, among other things.<eos> He wants to take you down with the legitimacy of the city behind him.
We're losing her, Nick.<eos> I hope that thing does what we think it does.<eos> Yeah, me too.<eos> How much do you know about the stick that he used to heal me with?<eos> Not much more than he told you.
Yeah, me too.<eos> How much do you know about the stick that he used to heal me with?<eos> Not much more than he told you.<eos> Does he always carry it?<eos> No, he got it out to help you.
I mean, with Renard as mayor, who knows what's gonna become of this city?<eos> Let's not think about that stuff anymore tonight.<eos> Let's just try to get some sleep.<eos> - Okay. - I love you.<eos> I love you too.
I've never met anyone like you.<eos> And I've been alive for a very, very long time.<eos> So you're not mad that I'm here?<eos> On the contrary.<eos> I was hoping your friends would invite you along tonight.
But if you show them pictures of kids, then they'll go on and on and on.<eos> I had a private chat with cortazar.<eos> And Eros is his pedophilia.<eos> You were talking about stopping it, taking it away.<eos> That's why he wouldn't help you.
Miller.<eos> Miller, answer me.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> You know, I have never been better.<eos> Thought we'd lost you there.
There's only one way to find out.<eos> What do you think, Miller?<eos> Crawl in there and blow up the thing that ate Julie?<eos> I think it's the best bad idea I've heard all day.<eos> We need to figure out that dead man's switch, create a longer delay so that we can get you out of there before the bomb detonates.
- Arjun?<eos> - How are you holding up?<eos> Acid stomach.<eos> And ravenous for a big thick steak...<eos> I assume they'll be evacuating you here to Luna.
And I'm sorry...<eos> Stop it. Stop.<eos> You never have to apologize to me.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Just know, I want to be there with you, and help you with that sad little garden.
Give me that arm.<eos> I can't believe I agreed to this.<eos> All right, go ahead, take your shot.<eos> What the hell was that?<eos> That's 'cause I like you, brother.
Doing nothing is just as bad as doing the wrong thing.<eos> Being a bystander...<eos> I mean, what kind of people are we, that we only help...<eos> I'm sorry, darlin', i think that seat is taken.<eos> Your kopeng say he buy me drinks if I sit here and listen to you.
But, just so you know, I'm not gonna fall for that.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Chardonnay, please.<eos> You think this is a game?<eos> That I was trying to fuck with you?
- Do you have a picture?<eos> - Why do you care?<eos> Curious what kind of guy you like to fuck.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> - Does that turn you on?
Hey, Jean.<eos> Yeah, okay, go ahead.<eos> Um... okay.<eos> "Dear Mom, I'm so sorry for all that has transpired."<eos> I know I haven't been able to see you as much as you'd like, but I love you and value you so much.
You know, I figured she was a knight 'cause she had armor on.<eos> She was looking for your sister, but I told her about you.<eos> Did she ever find you?<eos> She found me.<eos> What happened to you, Arry?
She's not my mama.<eos> You can have Cersei.<eos> I want the Mountain.<eos> The Mountain killed Father.<eos> He'll crush you with one hand.
Is that legal?<eos> To just bury animals in the yard?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, it's fine.<eos> You should see all the pets we have in our yard.<eos> Just glad that I could be here to help you, you know?
You have a collect call from Woodward Federal Correctional Institution.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - I love you.<eos> Something feels weird.<eos> I love you, too.
Everyone cares about what they feel. I don't care about what you feel.<eos> I care about what you think.<eos> What do you think about what you did?<eos> I think I did a shitty thing.<eos> I think I fucked you over, but I did not mean to fuck you over.
Grimnir!<eos> He's a god.<eos> You don't believe me?<eos> No, no. Just processing.<eos> Um, what else did God tell you to do?
Everything that happens is recorded and stored and recalled...<eos> The Book of Life.<eos> Right. Yes, yes, yes, yes.<eos> Is he still sulking?<eos> I'm sorry. For lynching you.
Are you trying to shame me?<eos> That shit will blow up in your face.<eos> Shame is the reason dead people only go out at night.<eos> I have no use for shame.<eos> Shame, I Dream of Genie, is what kept you from gettin' tossed off a roof long enough to make it to America.
A martyr.<eos> No.<eos> That's yours, my friend.<eos> You pledged allegiance to me and forged a blade.<eos> And they killed you for it.
Good, good... very good.<eos> -It's beautiful. -Mm-hmm.<eos> So what do we do now?<eos> He didn't smoke us when he had the chance-- I say we make a break for it.<eos> And why should we listen to you?
This is not the right time.<eos> I mean it.<eos> OK, OK, fine, I'm sorry.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too.
No matter what happens, your daughter's gonna be proud of you.<eos> I wish you coulda met her.<eos> Me, too.<eos> Jakie, Jakie.<eos> All your friends have either died or betrayed you.
Not just a five-year-old.<eos> Your five-year-old.<eos> Your daughter.<eos> That was a bad call.<eos> Okay? I just wanted to come here, and tell you that I love you.
You should know that.<eos> Who's there?<eos> Father?<eos> Father.<eos> How can I help you?
I thought we might need something with a bit more bite.<eos> So, why didn't you tell me about Zsasz?<eos> It's my business.<eos> Yeah? Not yours.<eos> That's a bit ridiculous, seeing as how I'm standing next to you most of the time.
Nobody.<eos> We can get you the money.<eos> Is that so?<eos> Who from?<eos> The guy that dropped you off in the Rolls Royce?
You want to thank me? When you find Dwight, you have him bring back Mario from the dead, how 'bout that?<eos> James Gordon. The James Gordon.<eos> Wow. It's actually you.<eos> So cool I'm meeting you.<eos> You should thank your friends. They're the ones who left you behind.
That car belonged to Isabella.<eos> Ed, whatever you've heard...<eos> I know it was you, Oswald.<eos> Isabella was my everything, and you took her from me.<eos> And now I've taken everything from you.
And afterward, you would have hated yourself!<eos> Well... we'll never know, will we?<eos> I did it for love.<eos> What?<eos> I did it because I love you.
I've told you why.<eos> The real reason.<eos> See, Ed, the trouble with talking to projections of your psyche... and you of all people should know this... is that they know everything you know.<eos> Including the things you're trying not to know.<eos> Gordon can't help you.
Your father and I were both members.<eos> I still am a member.<eos> Is that so?<eos> The Court doesn't mean you any harm.<eos> They have the highest regard for you.
Who are you?<eos> Ivy Pepper.<eos> Are you stupid?<eos> Do we know each other?<eos> I pulled you out of the river.
Friends.<eos> Oh.<eos> You're being serious.<eos> Look, don't take this the wrong way, but you are a bit of a freak.<eos> Did she tell you not to trust me? Yeah.
You think can harness it... you can't.<eos> You think it's part of you, but it doesn't have to be.<eos> Do you know why you were so easily defeated?<eos> Your rage, Bruce.<eos> It blinds you.
But when I was running the Wayne Enterprises RD division, we only had a half dozen off-site labs.<eos> Barnes isn't exactly the kind of guy who's gonna blend in.<eos> It'd have to be somewhere isolated, and small enough for them to control.<eos> I think I know where they took him.<eos> Just put them down wherever there's space, and then go back to where I found you.
Nothing.<eos> I said I was tired, then snuck out of my room.<eos> I'm dying, aren't I?<eos> Yes. I'm sorry.<eos> The process that brought you into this world was flawed.
Right away.<eos> Why?<eos> Because the city has been judged. And something bad is going to happen.<eos> Judged by who?<eos> The people who took you?
Gah! Wow, you are difficult to kill.<eos> More cockroach than penguin.<eos> But don't... you... dare call me "Ed."<eos> I'm... the Riddler.<eos> And I became him when I killed you.
How much longer are we gonna put up with this?<eos> Jim. Harvey, what'd you find?<eos> You were right about the walkie.<eos> It's got a one mile radius.<eos> Lucius couldn't trace a signal, but when we looked at a map, we figured there was only one place she could take you:
If this is my destiny,<eos> I do not want to fail.<eos> You won't, Bruce.<eos> All this, everything the Court of Owls set in motion, everything I have done, has been to prepare you for this moment, and afterward,<eos> I will bring you to the one whose vision has singled you out.
It's time.<eos> Press the button.<eos> Claim your destiny.<eos> Let Gotham fall so you may rise.<eos> Whatever destiny he's sold you, Bruce, he's lying.
This is an emergency.<eos> Please proceed to the nearest exit.<eos> Are you going to shoot me, Alfred?<eos> I want to help you.<eos> We'll reverse what he's done to you.
I will give you a day.<eos> I thought we were friends.<eos> When the Court of Owls calls, oone does not refuse.<eos> Still, I'm not upset.<eos> I knew when your old masters summoned you, it was to cook up some horror, and here's the thing:
I am.<eos> The Sensei trained me.<eos> Are you?<eos> He set you a task.<eos> He asked you to be the one that released the virus that now envelops this city.
If it wasn't for her,<eos> Gordon would have turned me over, and I'd most likely be dead.<eos> But fortune favors the bold.<eos> You said you called them after you knocked me out.<eos> You knew that I'd bring you here.
It's the only way we'll be able to move forward.<eos> I killed him.<eos> But it's not like you gave me a choice!<eos> There's always a choice.<eos> How many times have I told you not to bring a whip to a gunfight?
We already have a Flash.<eos> - Did you hear any of that?<eos> - Any of what?<eos> Nothing, it was just a cop being stupid.<eos> - Take you to breakfast?
- Hey.<eos> Am I in for another kidnapping?<eos> Okay, I deserve that.<eos> No, um, I just came to check on you.<eos> We haven't seen much of you since Christmas.
Why don't you come join us at S.T.A.R. Labs?<eos> You can help Team Flash fight meta-humans.<eos> - You're being serious?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Barry and the team, they'd be thrilled to have you.
You can help Team Flash fight meta-humans.<eos> - You're being serious?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Barry and the team, they'd be thrilled to have you.<eos> I would be thrilled to have you.
Why?<eos> Because if you take down Plunder, the news report that says that I captured him in the future, it's wrong.<eos> We can prove that we can alter the future here and now.<eos> So that's why you sent me out here.<eos> Hey, I sent you out here because you're a hero.
The last thing I need is for him to worry about something four months away that might not happen.<eos> That won't happen.<eos> That won't happen.<eos> Maybe in the meantime, you could let this arms dealer thing go?<eos> God, did my dad put you up to this too?
God, did my dad put you up to this too?<eos> No, he didn't have to.<eos> - Barry, look, this...<eos> - No, look, I'm sorry.<eos> I'm not trying to keep you from doing your job, okay?
Please?<eos> Okay, I'll drop it.<eos> Really?<eos> Just like that?<eos> Um, yes. Sometimes I do listen to you, you know?
Much better...<eos> look, I mean, she's doing it just much better.<eos> You can do this, okay?<eos> You just need a little practice and a little confidence.<eos> And we're all gonna help you with that, right?
I need to go catch up with Captain Singh, so I will be back in a little while, yeah?<eos> - It's good to see you.<eos> - Good to see you too.<eos> So... what's up?<eos> How can I help you?
What exactly do I do?<eos> Connect with your body, right?<eos> Connect with the air.<eos> Be pure electricity.<eos> You have to feel everything that's around you.
Well, that went swimmingly.<eos> Joe's right.<eos> We should've told him before now.<eos> What you should have told him is that I'm the one responsible, that the meta trying to kill him is one that I created.<eos> Julian, you can't change what happened to you.
People are responsible for their own actions.<eos> To say otherwise is just... it's just a way to make yourself feel better.<eos> Is that what you think I'm doing?<eos> Making excuses for things I've done in the past?<eos> You know, I'm really starting to regret bringing you in here.
You know, I'm really starting to regret bringing you in here.<eos> Come on, Dad.<eos> Ah, hey, Dad, it's me... calling, again.<eos> Look, I know you're upset, but, um, give me a call back, okay?<eos> I love you.
Yeah, he phased his speedster blood into Yorkin and neutralized his powers.<eos> That's the science behind it.<eos> I had a great teacher.<eos> And me?<eos> Once Yorkin's blood was stabilized, we actually managed to get an antidote that cured you.
You kill me.<eos> But you won't do that.<eos> All you care about is mercy.<eos> Yeah, you're right.<eos> Except I'm not the only one that wants to stop you.
You survived my wrath.<eos> The coward.<eos> - Irony.<eos> - Where are you?<eos> You said that I trapped you in the future, where?
It's only my will that keeps me on this side of sanity.<eos> You know, it's funny, when I think of sanity, I don't necessarily think of Savitar.<eos> Well, that's because you're small, Cisco.<eos> You've always been small.<eos> Reverb told you that you could have been a god.
When do we meet?<eos> Not long now.<eos> You're there when I become who I am.<eos> You're saying I caused you to get your speed?<eos> - I created you? - No.
Iris, wait.<eos> Iris, hey.<eos> Come on.<eos> Hey, hey, I love you, okay?<eos> I love you more than anything.
Smaller problems.<eos> So...<eos> - you wanna talk about it?<eos> - I don't know what I want, Dad.<eos> Iris... whatever you may be feeling right now about Barry, that man does love you.
Back to worship me once again?<eos> We just wanted to let you know that we're gonna defeat you.<eos> Unlikely.<eos> You told us that you're trapped, imprisoned for all eternity.<eos> You're never getting out of wherever my future self locked you up.
Ground.<eos> Air...<eos> I can feel again.<eos> I can breathe again.<eos> I've beaten you, finally.
Find my boy.<eos> I'm gonna do whatever it takes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I love you, Iris.<eos> I love you too.
I can't let that happen.<eos> Besides, until Barry can get Jay out of the Speed Force,<eos> Earth-3 needs a Flash to protect it.<eos> I love you, Jesse.<eos> I love you too.
When you speak, it's just words.<eos> But when you sing, you open up your soul and let who you really are shine through.<eos> Thanks, Mom.<eos> Hmm. I love you, my beautiful boy.<eos> I love you too.
And I can do a lot of things too.<eos> Wally West made it here too.<eos> This is exciting.<eos> It's good of you to join the party, Kid Flash.<eos> I'm happy to have you.
Pocket handkerchief?<eos> - Yes!<eos> I saw you on my Earth.<eos> You were in a coma.<eos> Your boyfriend brought you to us.
He is not my boyfriend.<eos> He... he's just a boy.<eos> Who is not my friend.<eos> - He's my nothing. - Okay.<eos> All right, uh, well, whoever he is said that this guy whammied you, and then he escaped to my Earth, he showed up at S.T.A.R. Labs, I went after him to try to get him to wake you up...

What are you doing?<eos> I'm putting some search parameters into the S.T.A.R. Labs satellite to see if anybody vibrates at a different frequency than Earth-1 folk.<eos> Wish we had a satellite that could do that on my Earth.<eos> Wish I had a bunch of this stuff.<eos> Oh. I could hook you up, girl.
What are we gonna do here?<eos> You're going with her.<eos> I'm not gonna stop her.<eos> Then you'll never find out what you want to know.<eos> I have nothing to offer you.
Begging.<eos> See, here it is.<eos> In the future, you and I have been enemies for years.<eos> Oh, there have been others, of course.<eos> There was Thawne, Zoom, DeVoe, but none of them hurt you like Savitar.
Yeah, well, I may have eaten some, slash... all.<eos> - Cisco.<eos> - Do you want me to go out and get you more strawberry Jell-O?<eos> I will get you more.<eos> No, it's fine, but next time I operate on you, you're getting bupkes, mister.
So to what do we owe the pleasure of your visit?<eos> Come to see how things turn out for Team Flash?<eos> I wanted to see what happened to my friend.<eos> I am not your friend, Flash.<eos> I'm so sorry I did this to you.
Tell me who he is.<eos> I'll never tell.<eos> You are gonna be so surprised when you find out.<eos> You know, I think your protégé went toe-to-toe with Savitar.<eos> Maybe he can help you out.
Just like to shine for my man.<eos> Yeah, I don't know.<eos> It looks a little tacky from over here.<eos> But I am old-fashioned.<eos> We told you to stay away, Flash.
No, you don't.<eos> Not yet.<eos> That's the problem.<eos> And neither of us can change what's gonna happen.<eos> I wish I could help you, believe me, I do.
What was that about?<eos> I'm just keeping that promise I made to you.<eos> I've been waiting for you.<eos> Fear not, my child.<eos> I have come only to offer you what you desire.
Go. Go. Go.<eos> Caitlin.<eos> You're alive.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I had to stop you to save you.
I'm done with that.<eos> And I'm done with this.<eos> Thank you for not making a big deal about me wearing this.<eos> Cecile Horton... I love you.<eos> I love you with all my heart.
It's an idea!<eos> You want to give me a perm?<eos> It's not for your hair, Steel Magnolia.<eos> This is for your brain, okay?<eos> I want to stop you from making new memories.
We don't want your kidneys.<eos> Okay, Barry... look at these photographs.<eos> We're your friends.<eos> Your family.<eos> We just want to help you, okay?
And I didn't know it then, but now looking back, I realize that that was the night that we fell in love.<eos> That was the night that we realized how much we needed each other.<eos> And look... I so wish... that I could take your dark memories away.<eos> I wish... that I could make all of that pain go away, but I can't.<eos> Okay? But what I do know, what I know, is that for every bad memory, there is a good one... that will get you through it.

You wouldn't even know where to start.<eos> That's not true at all.<eos> I know you spent your life forgotten and abandoned.<eos> Feared and hated.<eos> Hell, anyone who loved you had to be sirened to do so.
Here's the thing. I don't really feel like being your Terminator anymore.<eos> Your feelings are a non-issue.<eos> Our arrangement is very clear.<eos> Do as I say and you won't go to hell.<eos> Disobey me, and I send you there to stay.
Probably not.<eos> How about you prove it by giving me a tour of every single room?<eos> You are forgetting one very important thing.<eos> Enzo St. John,<eos> I invite you in.
That's where he saw the address of the safe house.<eos> It wasn't too difficult to track down her realtor.<eos> Although, that title deed paperwork did take forever.<eos> Come inside.<eos> I invite you in.
Cut to the chase!<eos> Where's the smoking gun in this story, huh?<eos> Why is the journal so important?<eos> Hey, listen, he can't control what he's seeing, Damon.<eos> Enzo, we call on you.
Where's the smoking gun in this story, huh?<eos> Why is the journal so important?<eos> Hey, listen, he can't control what he's seeing, Damon.<eos> Enzo, we call on you.<eos> One who loves you is reaching out to you.
Oh, God, no!<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> No, no. It's okay. I'm here to help.<eos> Get away from me!<eos> It's okay, I'm here to help you.
I never truly appreciated what badasses you Bennett witches were.<eos> Too bad I don't have my magic anymore.<eos> If I did, none of this would be happening.<eos> And I could've saved Enzo.<eos> Try and find comfort in the fact that Enzo loved you and he will always be with you.
Thanks.<eos> How's it feel to be a mere mortal?<eos> Uh, it... hurts.<eos> Definitely hurts.<eos> I heard they pumped you full of three pints of blood.
I want to live.<eos> Well.<eos> That's only human.<eos> You're gonna be okay.<eos> I love you so much.
I tell you what, I changed my mind.<eos> You can have the dagger.<eos> For the record, killing Cade's not the only thing this dagger's capable of.<eos> Because when you kill the devil, hell goes along with him.<eos> Speaking of which, any last words before I send you there myself?
- Damon...<eos> - Damon.<eos> Aw, that is so sweet.<eos> I'll be sure to tell your brother that you were thinking of him when you died.<eos> What took you so long?
Stefan.<eos> What are you...<eos> - Marry me.<eos> - What?<eos> I don't expect you to believe that I'm sorry, or that I love you just because I say it.
Who doesn't love a wedding?<eos> Sure, Caroline, get married.<eos> The day you've dreamt of your whole life, just throw it together like some shotgun Vegas wedding to lure out and murder your nemesis, all before the vows are over.<eos> Yeah, it's happening fast.<eos> I never got to explain to you why I said yes to Stefan.
I'm so sorry.<eos> I'm sorry in ways that I didn't even know existed.<eos> I know that I am one step removed from the reason that you lost Enzo.<eos> So I am extremely grateful that you're even sitting here being my friend right now.<eos> Bonnie, I love you so much.
There has to be magic involved;<eos> therefore, you don't need pain.<eos> Therefore, you can attend the wedding without fear of losing your link to me.<eos> That's not why I'm skipping the wedding.<eos> Stefan murdered you.
I'm imagining us next to a little church I remember in the French countryside.<eos> It's in the middle of a lavender field.<eos> I always thought it would be the perfect place to marry you.<eos> And after our wedding, we'd dance.<eos> And I'd tell you how much I love you.
We were dancing at my prom.<eos> It's funny the things we remember out of all the years that go by.<eos> I remember how you told me that when I was ready for you, you would be ready for me.<eos> I'm ready now.<eos> I think a part of me has been ready for this day since the moment I first saw you, the new mystery guy in the hallway at school.
Anticipating your failure, so it's kind of dumb to stick around.<eos> I have things to do.<eos> I can't believe you're here.<eos> I can't do the emotional reunion, Matt.<eos> I love you, and I'm sorry, but Katherine told me to ring this bell every five minutes until Mystic Falls burns.
- Dad!<eos> - Matt!<eos> I heard the bell.<eos> And then when they said we had to evacuate...<eos> I need you to get in a van so they can transport you to Grove Hill.
Do you think you'll convince him?<eos> No.<eos> But I have to try.<eos> I made a promise to Ric... that I wouldn't risk the girls growing up without a mother.<eos> So I can help you
If I want to convince Damon I have to move fast, and I can't do that unless I know you're safe.<eos> No.<eos> He's my brother.<eos> Family first.<eos> I love you so much.
No.<eos> He's my brother.<eos> Family first.<eos> I love you so much.<eos> I love you, too.
And why would you think that?<eos> Mom, she... told me what happened or what almost happened, apparently.<eos> Did she now?<eos> So, I suppose you're gonna tell me humans and the divine don't mix.<eos> Luci, listen, I have underestimated you for all of my existence, both in your ability to frustrate me and your capacity for good.
And why's that?<eos> Because it's about his beloved Chloe.<eos> He'll take it better from you.<eos> You're his closest friend.<eos> Lucifer may be stubborn, but he listens to you.
I hate to agree with Her Highness, but she's right.<eos> You'd be on your own.<eos> We both know I can't go down with you.<eos> Well, I went down and came back once before, it wasn't a problem.<eos> That's because Father brought you back.
Look at you.<eos> So pitiful.<eos> Stuck in the very Hell you once ruled.<eos> Trapped by your own guilt.<eos> And while we're pointing out how lame you are, you didn't even follow up on that thing I told you.
You want to keep your law enforcement sis away from your shady shenanigans.<eos> Watch.<eos> He's gonna try and say he doesn't have any ZX3.<eos> I don't have any ZX3.<eos> We're not here to bust you.
Without it, she's gonna die.<eos> And I really don't want her to die.<eos> Follow me.<eos> I hate you.<eos> I love you, too.
I am to blame for all of this.<eos> Ever since... ever since I returned, I've been... I've been manipulating you.<eos> Stoking your anger against your Father in hopes of using you against Him.<eos> But... but I've just made things worse.<eos> I pushed you and that human closer, knowing it would crush you when you learned the truth.
You gonna get your ass on that stage, clean and sober.<eos> I just need my pills.<eos> Just got to get to the show, you know that.<eos> - I love you.<eos> - I love you, too.
Just relax.<eos> Do I look like a kidnapper to you?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - I'm a lawyer, thank you very much.<eos> And I'm trying to instruct you on the virtues of the perfectly-timed execution.
No, you don't speak.<eos> I speak.<eos> You see, I understand how things happen, Bam.<eos> Me and the Feds both know that every man has his weakness.<eos> And in your case, it's that sweet, loving woman out there that raised you and then raised your little girl when you got locked up.
DNA. Boy, please.<eos> Ain't nothing but a hood rat.<eos> All right.<eos> Let's play.<eos> Did I tell you, I watched you on TV in that dirty-ass rec room in Danbury when Empire's first album was inducted into the Music Hall of Fame.
It's simple.<eos> I look forward to meeting Rafael.<eos> Bella.<eos> Bella, baby, Mommy loves you.<eos> Mommy loves you so much.
I didn't mean to...<eos> If you see what I see, you'd be laughing, too.<eos> I'm so sure.<eos> I mean, look at you.<eos> Last time I saw you, I was barely able to recognize you because of that addiction.
Get over there.<eos> You're a mess.<eos> You make me sick.<eos> I can't believe you set me up.<eos> I didn't set you up.
If you need help with anything, just ask.<eos> It's not too late to apply for that scholarship...<eos> Look, I said I'm good.<eos> What are you doing, anyway?<eos> What's Lucious got you into?
For once, why don't you pick a side?<eos> The hellhounds. See, when you sell your soul to a demon, they're the one that come and rip it out of you.<eos> Stay!<eos> You can control them? !<eos> Getting you here...
Really?<eos> That's great, Mom..<eos> - No, we're... we're fine. We...<eos> - It sounds like somethin'. Yeah.<eos> Love you, too. All right, Cass.
I know what I saw.<eos> Gwen...<eos> She's gonna sleep like a baby.<eos> Hey. It's okay. You're gonna be okay.<eos> It must really burn you, knowing I'm the one who put you in this prison.
Hey, real funny, daryn!<eos> This is my voicemail.<eos> Make your voice a mail. Come on.<eos> Cass, it's me.<eos> I've been trying to get ahold of you for days.
Yeah, and? And you're really painting me in a corner here, pal.<eos> Look, I know... I know that you and jarrod, you were close.<eos> And I liked him, too.<eos> He was a-a valued employee and he was a friend.<eos> Really? Yeah. 'Cause after you put him on part-time, he pretty much hated you.
You don't come.<eos> Beth and Mark don't come, Ellie and half the people that were affected by what happened here.<eos> People look to God when they want something and then...<eos> Well, now they've just deserted him.<eos> No, Paul! No, people love you.
I used your card.<eos> I didn't know.<eos> When I sent it, I didn't know she'd been raped.<eos> Paul! Hello, mate.<eos> I've been looking everywhere for you.
They're not judging you.<eos> You know, we're all here for you.<eos> Cath, I-I need to talk to you about something.<eos> Is it about the attack?<eos> Is it about what he did to you?
Listen.<eos> You've got a couple of caravans on site here you rent out, don't you?<eos> Yeah, why?<eos> It's just I'm in the process of figuring out where to live.<eos> So... do you think I could rent one off you for a few weeks maybe?
- Sorry?<eos> No, you can't.<eos> Why not?<eos> I don't trust you.<eos> Trish never trusted you.
You can't talk to me like that.<eos> I'm not your ISVA.<eos> You chose not to be a client of ours.<eos> - I'm just a woman who's angry.<eos> - With me? With the man who did this to you.
I know you want me in prison, but look at my life here.<eos> I've lost my family... my friends.<eos> I'm only here because I'm not brave enough to kill myself and I should've done that a long time ago.<eos> I've got half an hour. I've got to get back.<eos> I saw you on the news earlier.
I lost everything I had everything I was and I'll never escape it.<eos> I was there that night, in the car park.<eos> I could have stopped you.<eos> No, he was already dead.<eos> I saw you through the window, when I was cleaning.
You've got to face up to the world.<eos> Take some responsibility for your own life.<eos> The future's not inevitable.<eos> It's down to you.<eos> I know I've not been good at the dad thing, but I love you so much, Daze.
Yeah, why wouldn't it be?<eos> You sound a bit odd.<eos> Oh, do I?<eos> Thanks very much.<eos> - You know I love you, don't you? - Yeah.
Fine. Just hurry up.<eos> Hi, Dad.<eos> A fisherman reported your boat empty.<eos> They called a lifeboat out.<eos> They found you in the water unconscious with hypothermia.
I'm sorry you're lost.<eos> I'm sorry you feel alone.<eos> I am listening to you, I'm hearing everything you say.<eos> But, Mark, your grief is still overwhelming you.<eos> Please believe me, there are people who can help you.
What about the twine - did you touch that?<eos> Yeah, I pulled it out to see.<eos> -Why?<eos> -I didn't know what it was, did I?<eos> It wasn't till I saw the twine that I called you.
So here goes.<eos> All of this is for you, Mikey.<eos> Why do you think I'm up here singing this stupid song about women's chunky Charlies with a crazy man who thinks Hurricane Katrina was a David Copperfield illusion?<eos> Water doesn't melt buildings!<eos> It's all just to impress you.
Let's get you some breakfast.<eos> Hey!<eos> Aren't you forgetting something?<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too.
I'll be fine.<eos> It's a good call.<eos> Come here.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too.
Sweetheart, I was supposed to help you finish it.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Come here.<eos> I love you so much.
I'm so sorry.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Come here.<eos> I love you so much.<eos> I love you, too.
I love you, too.<eos> Okay. Time to get in.<eos> Call me as soon as you get there.<eos> Please.<eos> I love you with all my heart.
If this bracelet won't let me go, I don't see why you should get away so easily.<eos> I haven't forgiven you but<eos> you're my only witness.<eos> (BREATHING RAPIDLY)<eos> I'm gonna drag you with me, this life you gave me...
Let's get a list of all the officers who were at the murder scene.<eos> See if they've any links to Lily-Anne, oh and find out, who else was in the evidence room that day.<eos> I'm on it.<eos> So why are you trusting Steve?<eos> After everything he's done to you.
I think I really need to give her some moral support.<eos> Is it okay if we meet later?<eos> Sure.<eos> Of course, no problem.<eos> I'll call you when I'm done.
The paella's gonna be another twenty minutes, is that alright?<eos> Brilliant.<eos> (ELEVATOR'S BELL)<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Did Harry send you?
But I don't want to get her hopes up, until we sort out what we want.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I've never made any secret of that.<eos> It's still early you know.<eos> I could take you out for dinner.
He's dead?<eos> Jay was not strong enough.<eos> He's not like you.<eos> Harry, it's yours.<eos> It's meant for you.
It wasn't just the bracelet, it, it was me too...<eos> God I was blinded by its power, it seduced me,<eos> they died because of me...<eos> But you're strong.<eos> Though it will happen to you in time.
- Nope.<eos> - Fair enough. - How's trauma treating you?<eos> Mm. Like a doormat.<eos> I'm really hoping today's gonna be a slower day for once.<eos> Dana, may I borrow you for two secs?
With his lung surgery, cardiac issues, risk of another crisis, it's...<eos> Yeah. I know.<eos> Alex, I didn't know about your father.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> That little girl... she's lucky to have you in her dad's corner.
You look like you've got everything under control.<eos> You mind if I step out?<eos> Thank you for your help, Charlie.<eos> You need to tell me what's going on.<eos> Garth said he killed you.
I thought I'd be on the outside looking in forever, you know?<eos> And at that time... there was only one way I could see out.<eos> Shahir, I'm... I'm... I'm sorry.<eos> When you don't see anything good in yourself... ending your life might seem like a favor to those you love.<eos> So I think your father, in his own tortured way, was trying to spare you.
Parties is my business.<eos> We can do an Enchantment Under the Sea theme, a Teddy Bear Picnic, whatever your heart desires.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> Let me help you.
You can't fault your intentions, even if, you know, you misjudged a little.<eos> You think?<eos> You two will be laughing about this tomorrow.<eos> This is a great party.<eos> Alex... She's, um... She's lucky to have you as a friend.
You two will be laughing about this tomorrow.<eos> This is a great party.<eos> Alex... She's, um... She's lucky to have you as a friend.<eos> You're nice.<eos> Um, I was thinking maybe later next week, I could take you out to dinner to say thank you.
The real secret is more alcohol.<eos> - Hey. - I'm starving.<eos> I haven't eaten anything all day, and all I keep thinking about is what's squirming around in the spinach dip or what laid eggs in the fruit.<eos> Don't even get me started on the cheese mites.<eos> Look, I've always believed that tough love is the way to go in the E.R., but I might have maybe pushed you a little bit too hard today.
I'm good.<eos> - Keep the change.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Mother's got her soup line today late.<eos> I think we expected to see you next week.
No, it's not.<eos> You say you've changed.<eos> Good. I hope it's true.<eos> I've prayed for it long enough.<eos> I'm happy you're home, and I love you, but you don't get extra points for doing what's simply required, what everybody else does.
I read this while you were inside.<eos> I didn't know there was a name for it.<eos> I have always known since you were little... there was something in you.<eos> And I didn't do anything about it.<eos> I've done a lot of soul-searching... about my part in what happened to you.
If you can satisfy my demands.<eos> Can anybody, Joanie?<eos> We did pretty well the last time.<eos> Autumn Leaves made millions.<eos> It would have made a million more if you'd gotten off your goddamn high horse and let me mess you up a little.
Who is it?<eos> Joan Crawford.<eos> You're fucking kidding me.<eos> Bette.<eos> Lucille, what the hell brings you to the theater?
Yeah.<eos> I'm just offering some ideas.<eos> Don't tell me how to play my character before I've even shot a scene.<eos> I have done a lot of hard work and preparation, and you are just trying to throw me.<eos> I'm trying to help you.

Yeah, the road got washed out.<eos> I'll see you on the set, Joan.<eos> You want to explain that?<eos> Explain?<eos> I don't have to explain a goddamn thing to you.
Have a great night!<eos> Chuck: You know you can wait inside.<eos> You won't want to hear it, but this is for the best.<eos> Please, Jimmy...<eos> Whatever you think of me, whatever colorful names you're calling me in your head right now, please understand I'm trying to help you.
You won't want to hear it, but this is for the best.<eos> Please, Jimmy...<eos> Whatever you think of me, whatever colorful names you're calling me in your head right now, please understand I'm trying to help you.<eos> Here's what's going to happen.<eos> The police will arrest you, and I'm sorry, but I will be pressing charges.
I'll tell you why my brother brought my ex-wife to this hearing.<eos> 4,000 miles she came, lured by concern for me.<eos> What Jimmy's driving at is the last time I saw her, I covered up my illness.<eos> I'd been suffering from it for some time, but I went to great lengths to conceal that fact from her.<eos> I'm sorry I deceived you, Rebecca.
I'm calling your bluff.<eos> This is my firm.<eos> I built it.<eos> Your father was working in a two-room office when I joined him.<eos> And you I tutored for the bar exam.
I sold the rest of my ads.<eos> - That must be a relief.<eos> They loved the response they got. Were so impressed, they threw in this baby.<eos> Signed by the one and only Ritchie Blackmore.<eos> And, uh, lying on the floor helps you with your fingering?
You go.<eos> I got this!<eos> Guys, are you seeing this?<eos> Yeah. We're seeing it.<eos> Keep that drone clear, they'll hear you.
All right, tell me. Then tell me.<eos> No. You tell me, Mr. Director Man.<eos> Have you ever been rebuffed by a woman because of how you look?<eos> I'm betting no.<eos> I'm guessing that your success was enough, that they fucked you despite your beer gut and your middle-age sag.
It's work to fix him the same goddamn glass of scotch every night and feign interest while he rants about his boss.<eos> It's work to tolerate his forgetting to ask you about your day, and your feelings, and your thoughts.<eos> And it's work to feel like a staging ground for someone else's ambitions.<eos> You just described my life with you.<eos> Well, then I've prepared you to be a good wife.
I'm not going.<eos> I didn't even know my father...<eos> or my mother.<eos> I'm not going.<eos> Tom, in the last three weeks since your father died, you have been obsessing over who he was and why he and your mother gave you up.
I can't say more.<eos> Stay under the trees.<eos> They can't see you under the trees.<eos> Wait, wait.<eos> Tom, your whole life to this point... all your training and your skills... have been preparing you for this moment.
He said Scottie Hargrave is gonna offer me a job.<eos> Well, she already offered you a job, and you told her no.<eos> Something tells me Scottie Hargrave is not the kind of woman who takes "no" for an answer.<eos> Tom Keen.<eos> I've been looking everywhere for you.
Just let my son go.<eos> Oh, the boy... he's gotten so big.<eos> It's gonna be okay, Maddox.<eos> Oh, Maddox, that's right.<eos> Hey, Maddox, did Mommy ever tell you that we used to work together?
I'm scared.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> I love you.<eos> Do you hear me?<eos> I love you so much.
Well, that sounds like guilty.<eos> Look, I understand why it's hard for you to believe me, but we both know Howard did something incredibly cruel when he sent you to me and didn't allow you to tell me that you're my son,<eos> that after all these years, you're still alive.<eos> That cruelty was also a blessing, because you got to see how I truly feel about my son, that I never stopped loving him.<eos> I never stopped loving you.
No, I... I thought you were okay with all of that!<eos> I was, I am!<eos> And that you're supportive of me.<eos> I am supportive of you!<eos> I have always been supportive of you.
That's not a coincidence.<eos> ♪ Dreams of far off times ♪ ♪ to tame ♪<eos> You know what?<eos> I know you had a tough time growing up.<eos> And I know that your mom put you through the ringer.
You missed curfew last night.<eos> By seven minutes.<eos> I was with Archie, who has red hair, yes, but is nothing like Jason Blossom.<eos> Oh, but sweetie, all boys are like Jason Blossom.<eos> I love you so much, Elizabeth.
This summer what?<eos> That's it?<eos> We don't talk anymore?<eos> Dad.<eos> I would never force you to play football.
Would've gone a long way with me.<eos> I'm not going to ask what you did with Veronica at Cheryl's.<eos> But I'm asking you now, right now, if you love me, Archie.<eos> Or even like me?<eos> Of course I love you, Betty.
What's up is I saw you, Archie.<eos> In the music room.<eos> With Ms. Grundy.<eos> Keep your voice down, my dad's inside.<eos> I'm trying to help you, dude.
You?<eos> Grundy and me.<eos> We're telling Weatherbee.<eos> At least, I am.<eos> And also, I didn't mean all that crap I said to you.
All things considered, I was pretty generous.<eos> So generous you didn't give him a second chance?<eos> Of course I did.<eos> You have no idea how many times I bailed that man out of jail.<eos> Son, when someone is drowning, you can try to save them, but not if they're gonna drag you down with them.
For you.<eos> Yeah, and who cares if Jughead ended up drowning, too.<eos> Reporting my American Excess card as stolen, well-played.<eos> I thought you might appreciate that.<eos> Now, mija. I've done things to upset you.
- What the hell happened?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> It's fine now.<eos> Mr. Andrews took care of it.<eos> What jacked-up crap did they accuse you of in there, huh?
At the home, the Sisters said each of us had a guardian angel.<eos> You're mine, Betty.<eos> I'm so sorry about Jason,<eos> I know how much you loved him.<eos> And he always talked about how much he loved you.
And he always talked about how much he loved you.<eos> Cheryl, where are your mom and aad?<eos> You have to leave.<eos> Now.<eos> My parents, I don't think they want to help you.
Hiram?<eos> But...<eos> Why would he...<eos> Maybe he got a whiff of your little romance with Freddy Andrews?<eos> But the real question is, who ratted you out?
Or you can try and fix things.<eos> We're past that point, Archie.<eos> I spoke to Mom last week, she didn't mention any of this, Dad.<eos> Your mom moved out two years ago.<eos> She didn't tell you because she wanted me to be the bearer of bad news.
Look, I only came over here to apologize.<eos> You don't have to go Dark Betty on me again.<eos> I'm not going!<eos> I'm not going Dark anything.<eos> Ethel, is Chuck bothering you?
No, what if he's protecting FP or tries to warn him?<eos> He's our friend, Ronnie.<eos> My dad is this close to being released, and my mom's in denial and she's ready to welcome him back with open arms.<eos> Me, I'd like to know exactly who we're inviting back into our lives.<eos> Look, Veronica, I really wanna help you,

- Keep talking, Hal, and the next brick I throw may not be at a window.<eos> You remember our Homecoming, Alice?<eos> Back in the day?<eos> Castles in the Clouds?<eos> Your mom ever tell you about that night?
We've got a little problem.<eos> - Out of the van, now!<eos> Get out of the van now.<eos> It's been a long time, Agent Memphis.<eos> What brings you to Germany? I'm on special assignment.
Hmm?<eos> Angela drives a nice ride.<eos> I'm in.<eos> Well, I'm glad that you're here.<eos> The President is lucky to have you.
I miss you.<eos> What?<eos> You said no one ever chooses you.<eos> Marcus.<eos> I did choose you.
- And?<eos> - And he's done horrible, terrible things.<eos> - And?<eos> And... and he's old!<eos> And he somehow loves you.

Dakota, where are you going?<eos> I'm talking to Ms. Coyle.<eos> I can't believe you'd do this.<eos> Listen, I'm sorry that I was such a shitty boyfriend.<eos> I'm sorry that I got stoned and I forgot to take you to that audition.
- Did I ever apologize for that?<eos> - No.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Anyway, um...<eos> I, uh, saw on your schedule that you have practice after school, so I was just hoping to catch you.
We both like you, chick.<eos> Not about that.<eos> It's...<eos> Then what's it about?<eos> I'm gonna help you out with a lot of things, norman.
Not about that.<eos> It's...<eos> Then what's it about?<eos> I'm gonna help you out with a lot of things, norman.<eos> Help you out with everything... Everything.
I mean, there is something. Very, very wrong with her.<eos> And then I've tried to help, But, I mean, she's...<eos> Chick, she's going to ruin us. If I don't rein her in, and I just... Don't know how to rein her in, exactly.<eos> All right.<eos> Well, maybe I can help you... With her.
Just don't say anything until your lawyer gets there.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> tell me that you understand what I'm saying.<eos> You have to let me help you, okay?<eos> Please let me help you.
Please let me help you.<eos> Gotta go.<eos> So after you placed the body in the trunk, how many miles did you drive?<eos> I think... it was about five miles, maybe more.<eos> How long did the drive take you?
You had a crazy mother who left you a failing business.<eos> You've developed this strange adult affect to present maturity, but from where I'm sitting, you're a child.<eos> And children sometimes act out.<eos> Almost always because they feel ignored.<eos> So I'm startin' to think that... maybe calling' in all my cops and... searching your motel, your house, questioning you now, is just giving you exactly what you want:
Come on, boy, come on.<eos> I told you I'd take care of it, Norman.<eos> Morning, Sheriff.<eos> I appreciate the visit, but we're not supposed to be talking anymore.<eos> We're charging you additionally with the murders of Jim Blackwell and Audrey Ellis.
Personally, I wouldn't count on it.<eos> Dylan, what happened?<eos> Katie's with my dad.<eos> I'm with you, we'll figure it out.<eos> I wanted to be here and help you with this.
At least not one I can use in court.<eos> Well, I was only in Pineview for two weeks.<eos> And I don't think anyone there ever really understood me.<eos> Which is why I think it's crucial that we have you evaluated now.<eos> I need to understand you to best figure out how to help you.
We can assume different identities.<eos> I know Norma's death broke you, but I can live with you broken.<eos> I can take care of you.<eos> Please, Alex, you're heading down a dark road.<eos> Let me help you.
You get a partner?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Just trying him out.<eos> That's funny.<eos> I always saw you as the lone wolf type.
- It's not reachable.<eos> Adi!<eos> - Bro...<eos> Bro, where were you?<eos> - Love you, buddy.
Where are you?<eos> The coffee shop.<eos> And I'm done pulling my hair and using them as noodles in my coffee...<eos> Oh my, what are you doing?<eos> Do you know what condition I am in waiting for you?
Would it look nice if we met outside in a hotel or other shady places?<eos> Or live here decently, with your permission and blessings.<eos> Did you take your brother's blessings?<eos> He will kill me.<eos> I see...and I will spare you?
Nice...and how do you go?<eos> - Bantu's bike.<eos> I take the bus or train.<eos> Sometimes uncle's car as well.<eos> What brings you to Mumbai?
Paplu's at home. - He's at home.<eos> Let's go home, Come, let's go home.<eos> Charu aunty. Let's go home.<eos> Paplu.<eos> Thank God I found you Paplu, or you would've been lost.
Eyes! Elbow!<eos> Hey, hey! I'm not here to hurt you.<eos> Okay?<eos> Groin!<eos> I'm here to help you.
This guy was much more terrifying.<eos> I'm only in D.C. for 36 hours and...<eos> I missed you, Tom.<eos> You abandoned me.<eos> As soon as they put you on the ticket.
I could.<eos> You could what?<eos> Take care of the girl.<eos> Make her back away from the campaign.<eos> That's not... why I called you here.
- No, I...<eos> I-I can't do this.<eos> - Mi-Michael, wait, please!<eos> I know...<eos> I've hurt you in unimaginable ways.
We were in love.<eos> I loved you, at least.<eos> I was in love... with you.<eos> That's the one thing that I'm sure of.<eos> I love you still.
Perhaps our paths will cross again.<eos> I hope they do.<eos> - You treated him?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Who told you to treat him?
- You treated him?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Who told you to treat him?<eos> No one.<eos> Who forbade you, or anyone, to attempt to treat him?
Don't trust any of them.<eos> They're the Brotherhood.<eos> And the last thing their lord told them to do was sell me to a red witch to be murdered.<eos> Thoros?<eos> I hardly recognized you.
Your faithful sister, Sansa.<eos> - They forced me to do it.<eos> - Did they?<eos> With a knife at your throat?<eos> Did they put you in a rack and stretched you till your bones started to crack?
Michigan.<eos> Anyway, they want you.<eos> The job is yours.<eos> No shit.<eos> Everybody in the division likes you.
Yeah, well, if you're big enough to sit in the front seat,<eos> I think you can handle it... smart-ass.<eos> Come here.<eos> I love you, Firefly.<eos> I love you, too.
Hm! She swore one day I'd die in this chair.<eos> Said there are worse ways to go.<eos> Where's Sidney?<eos> The Beacon.<eos> The Beacon, he kept calling you.
Get off my property.<eos> Where's Sidney?<eos> Are you protecting him?<eos> This is a family matter.<eos> Betsy, he's only trying to help you.
What, you're gonna beat me like you did my boy?<eos> No.<eos> You damn near killed him.<eos> Help me.<eos> No wonder they kicked you out of the church.
Dear lord, what happened?<eos> Are the girls okay?<eos> I've got 'em to bed, finally.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I'm sorry I dragged you into all this.
Get in after 'em, I'll cut 'em off.<eos> Go, go, go.<eos> The hell you doing?<eos> This is where they came out, man.<eos> Two paramedics and one wounded guy outran you?
He's fucking done.<eos> Where's the son of a bitch we came for?<eos> I got him.<eos> Alive.<eos> Now we find out who sent you.
Can't even get something to write with.<eos> How do I get a pen and paper?<eos> Forget the pen and paper.<eos> Whatever you're using it for, it's a waste of time.<eos> But what I can get you is a belt.
Don't let this happen!<eos> Don't try to talk.<eos> You're at James Madison Hospital.<eos> You took quite a beating.<eos> The doctors patched you up.
- Not gonna get a drink, am I?<eos> No, you are, you are.<eos> All right, your Kahlúa and Coke.<eos> - With an olive.<eos> - Mm! I'm telling you, it's real love this time.
Hey. Who is that?<eos> He looks familiar.<eos> Yeah, he should.<eos> That's Kevin's brother.<eos> The psycho that put you in a coma?
You know, my college roommate got something like that after a trip to Amsterdam.<eos> Only it wasn't on his foot.<eos> - I'm serious.<eos> - I'm serious too.<eos> Honestly, Julia, I love you, but you're crazy.
He would want his Sunburst, I'll bet.<eos> So are we just gonna pretend like nothing happened?<eos> You see a capo lying around here anywhere?<eos> The least you could have done was called.<eos> You know, I sat there for two hours waiting for you.
So are we just gonna pretend like nothing happened?<eos> You see a capo lying around here anywhere?<eos> The least you could have done was called.<eos> You know, I sat there for two hours waiting for you.<eos> Well, I did tell you that I might not make it.
That's not why I'm here.<eos> What?<eos> You've changed.<eos> - I have? - Mm.<eos> It's like when you fell out of the sky, something shook out of you.
I like what we have.<eos> I just think it might need... a tag or something.<eos> What is a tag?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Just watching you.
Just 'cause he's miserable and he says he's gonna fight for you doesn't mean he's the one for you.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I was talking about this with Maddie the other day.<eos> I think sometimes these women, you know, in relationships, we let ourselves be the object or something.<eos> You know, man says that he loves you.
- watching you do that.<eos> - Okay, geez.<eos> Okay, geez.<eos> Sorry, I love you.<eos> I love you too.
She used to tell me she thought that was where you were most at home, artistically.<eos> I just don't think she'd want you to let that part of yourself go.<eos> I think she'd say something like,<eos> "Hey, Deacon, you know, you're made of music.<eos> It's the thing that's always healed you.
Excuse me?<eos> - How would you characterize<eos> - your relationship to Maddie?<eos> - I don't know you, man, okay?<eos> I've never seen you before in my life.
No, he's out foraging for hickory wood.<eos> Long story. Come in, please.<eos> Oh, thanks, but I'm only here for a minute.<eos> I come bearing news.<eos> I have the distinct pleasure of informing you that you have been cast as John Adams in the New Lear Theatre's production of 1776! Ah!
- Maybe you guys should come over.<eos> - Look, everything's fine.<eos> Frankie went to bed with minimal fuss.<eos> I'm about to pass out.<eos> So thank you for your concern, but we don't need your help.
A special channel so that you can always reach me any time, day or night.<eos> - It's short-wave.<eos> - Yes.<eos> So we never have to be far apart from each other.<eos> Frankie, I'm going to get you through this.
I just shot that...<eos> What is that thing?<eos> A dummy?<eos> The politically correct term is "decoy."<eos> Well, I'm sorry that I scared you, but that... "decoy" scared me.
Are you insane?<eos> - You can't handle a "Grace Hanson."<eos> - I'm having fun!<eos> Since when is your idea of fun getting drunk and sniffing some guy?<eos> You do realize you have a husband waiting for you at home.
- Good.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> She took it far better than I expected.<eos> Sends her love to you.
What is, breaking the heart of a 90-year-old woman?<eos> It's sweet that you still think she has a heart.<eos> I'm just surprised that she can still muster up enough energy to be...<eos> Her.<eos> Tell you what, if my mom were still alive, she'd bake you a blintz casserole, kiss you on the head, and tell you you're wonderful.
- Yes.<eos> A liability?<eos> Yes.<eos> You knew that when you left Buenos Aires?<eos> I knew that the day I met you.
For the record, I am the one who is going to give you nightmares.<eos> So, what's the plan?<eos> That big?<eos> Whoa. You're not kidding.<eos> I haven't seen you like this since...
You are faster, stronger, and smarter than him.<eos> How could you be so weak?<eos> How could you let that man outplay you?<eos> This is what happened, Olivia.<eos> He outplayed you in the generals, he outplayed you tonight when he paid an assassin to shoot Frankie Vargas.
I know he is not cheating on you.<eos> And I know that some slut was texting him on election night... consolation for his big loss.<eos> He's been staying out all hours of the night with her ever since.<eos> I wanted to think it was you, but the two of you were in the same room that night.<eos> I was watching you. You weren't texting him.
I can't tell you the answers to those questions.<eos> What?<eos> Why not?<eos> I can't tell you answers to those questions.<eos> There are things about my past, things I've done, things... that would scare you, things that would prevent you from ever looking at me the same way again.
Every breath, Eli.<eos> Every breath.<eos> Jake.<eos> Sorry. Did I scare you?<eos> No. I was gonna call you, actually.
So you're back with him?<eos> You're under his control again?<eos> Is that who you were meeting at the motel?<eos> Come on.<eos> He ordered you to kill Jennifer and destroy evidence that could've pointed to Cyrus' innocence,
I have a favor to ask.<eos> Get in the car, Liv, come on.<eos> I need you to do something for me.<eos> - They still here? - Is who still here?<eos> The men who brought you here.
You're using up your time!<eos> What do you want to know?<eos> I didn't come here to ask questions.<eos> No, you came here to kill me.<eos> She sent you here to kill me!
Keep low, just in case.<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> Start talking.<eos> Quinn agreed to help me get to the bottom of whatever's going on with Rowan.<eos> I thought about calling you, but you would have ratted me out to Olivia, and the last time I saw her, she wasn't exactly being open-minded.
It happens.<eos> Maybe they can meet, uh, a nice woman and fall in love and have a relationship, and be normal.<eos> People can change.<eos> You are wrong about your father.<eos> So, no, I'm not gonna kill the man who loves you most in this world, even more than me.

I need my thing.<eos> And my thing can't just be supporting your thing.<eos> Anybody that does something extraordinary has someone in the shadows taking it on the chin.<eos> We're just taking shifts.<eos> I'd be able to support you more if I were really in love with you.
Reynard is targeting Hedges.<eos> So the answer is to hire Michael Bublé to kidnap me and then use me as your bait.<eos> If I'm wrong, raise your hand.<eos> Look, you're right.<eos> It was wrong grabbing you the way that we did, but sooner or later, he was gonna find you.
I was the best student you ever had here.<eos> You said that.<eos> I confused talent with character.<eos> You need both to be a true magician, Marina.<eos> Kicking you out wasn't a choice.
No, I just think that what you want here is revenge and...<eos> And you don't?<eos> Just don't be within 20 feet of The Beast when we make our move, okay?<eos> Do it before I get Reynard, you better not be within 20 miles of me.<eos> I came here to warn you and you're threatening me.
I've been doing a lot of reflecting lately on the happiest moments of my life, and I thought of a big one.<eos> You ever make plans with someone you do not want to hang out with and then they cancel?<eos> Does wet money work, man?<eos> What a rip.<eos> I can't really help you out with the hotel, but my brother will wire me money... in the next couple days.
- It is only gonna get more dangerous. - No...<eos> I want you to walk down the hall with your hands up.<eos> I want you to tell them you're pregnant the minute you see them.<eos> - Yell it.<eos> Make sure that they hear you. - Hey!
And fun fact number 41...<eos> It's TJ.<eos> It's First Son, TJ Bennett.<eos> I told you we might get lucky today.<eos> I love you, TJ!
I'll never see Alex again, and who knows what they'll do to Max, now that he's been "corrupted."<eos> Look at it this way, T. At least you got the first chapter of your memoirs figured out.<eos> As usual, Coop, you're the only one around here who makes me feel any better.<eos> Oh. Hey.<eos> Let me help you with that.
What you witnessed... was the test of a technology that you have never seen before, one capable of inter-dimensional travel.<eos> All in preparation for the Greatest Day.<eos> I understand the hardships that all of you...<eos> Asshole.<eos> They're holding for you.
No, it's not.<eos> You know, if you actually paid attention for once, you might learn something.<eos> I don't want to learn this stuff; it's stupid.<eos> All I have to do is tell one of the elders that I've been looking after a boy who is violent, destructive, and completely without remorse, and that I have identified him as a candidate for focused restoration.<eos> And in just a few seconds, they will pull you out of sight, and you will never see your family again.
That's for my... personal horticulturalist.<eos> You know what I'm sayin'?<eos> I don't.<eos> You seem to get so much joy out of your money.<eos> I envy you.

I stayed loyal to Mr. Burns, coproduced a failed revenge rap, and now we've got nothing.<eos> I know it's crazy, but he needed me.<eos> Oh, it's okay, Homie.<eos> You're not mad?<eos> Your heart told you to stick with Mr. Burns, and the thing I love about you most is you've got a heart as big as The Ritz.
Brothers in avarice.<eos> Why?<eos> Because you told me to!<eos> In your own last chapter.<eos> "You will never be truly ruthless until you destroy the one who made you."
Joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy...<eos> Milhouse, get out of the way.<eos> Joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, and Lisa's only "B." Super joy.<eos> Huh! It's in phys ed!<eos> I don't want to alarm you, but grade point average: 3.999999999...
Oh, no, don't try that, Dad.<eos> You might get into trouble.<eos> Just the thought of it is making me sweat.<eos> And my heart is palpitating.<eos> Lisa, honey, Daddy will help you, right after you tell me the symptoms of anxiety.
- I'm so sorry, Dad!<eos> - Accidents happen.<eos> Wow, Homie. Spilled gravy is one of your top three strangulation triggers.<eos> I could never strangle a boy... in front of the pig.<eos> Huh. I think he really has become a support animal for you.
- Really?<eos> Basically, it was when you were born.<eos> Thanks. I'm all cheered up.<eos> But I got over it.<eos> And your older, smarter brother is going to help you.

Isn't a father more important than a victory?<eos> I've never really known either.<eos> You resign?<eos> !<eos> Dad, Dad, it seems I love you.
In the office.<eos> Play it here.<eos> Fred Johnson.<eos> We have traveled far together, my beratna, but this is where we must part ways.<eos> Ever since I found you, broken, looking for redemption under a Belter knife,
There was nothing left for us to fear.<eos> But instead, you preserved what you could of this terrible new weapon, and took it back to Tycho with you, keeping those secrets for yourself, no doubt believing that when the time comes, as it surely must, you and you alone,<eos> would decide when to use the weapon to defend the Belt.<eos> Now, I believe you have the Belt ere kori.<eos> And we have taken to you as a brother.
Repeat.<eos> We are ready to execute.<eos> Do you copy?<eos> You two are in the wrong place.<eos> I told you to stay out of this.
Yes, I appreciate your dedication, really, but don't you think you're making a pretty big mistake?<eos> You were arrested for the murder of Rachel Wood.<eos> Where were you the night she was murdered?<eos> I don't know when she was murdered.<eos> You didn't seem surprised when we told you.
Let's go.<eos> Talk about coffee going right through ya.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> Well, my calendar's pretty open, seeing as how I'm dead.<eos> Look, if this is some kind of revenge haunting, don't forget I shot you to put you out of your misery.
Auggie, please, baby, listen.<eos> - Why are you doing this, huh?<eos> - Auggie, please, listen.<eos> - We're your parents.<eos> - We love you, Auggie.
- Well, maybe not.<eos> Well, this is a surprise.<eos> There is a third heartbeat.<eos> - Three? - Mm-hmm.<eos> I love you and we can do this.
Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> I overslept.<eos> Did everything go okay last night?<eos> Oh, yeah. No, we had a great time, didn't we?<eos> Okay, well, we'll call you later.
Diana knew you were down there.<eos> She knew you were drawing.<eos> She was drawing the same thing.<eos> A lot of them are the same.<eos> I think it's time I told you I'm sorry for what I did to you.
Guess who walks in.<eos> I ain't got time for games, son.<eos> It's not a game, dad.<eos> It's Burkhardt.<eos> The cop who took you down, he's here at the hotel.
- He alone?<eos> - No, no.<eos> He's here with a bunch of friends for a birthday.<eos> Gonna be here two nights.<eos> I'm gonna make him pay for what he did to you.
Okay.<eos> I was just looking at the view.<eos> It is so... beautiful, yes.<eos> But it could never hold a candle to the view of you.<eos> Eve, there's something I've never told you.
I was just looking at the view.<eos> It is so... beautiful, yes.<eos> But it could never hold a candle to the view of you.<eos> Eve, there's something I've never told you.<eos> I admire you so much for everything you've been through.
Nick, have you seen Monroe?<eos> I never realized how beautiful your eyes were.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I like your eyes too.<eos> Ever since the first time I saw you, I knew you were special.
Well, there's some Wesen that are ecologically wired to protect the natural environment - they live in. - Yeah.<eos> Usually forest Wesen who do not take kindly to disrespecting nature.<eos> You know, it's like if someone went into your house, broke in, shot your dog, ate your cat, fished in your aquarium, set your kitchen on fire, and peed in your bed.<eos> It would have the same kind of effect.<eos> And, by that, he means if you mess with their territory, they will seriously mess you up.
Wu?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> Wu's got something he wants us to see.<eos> We'll call you when we find out what that is.
You can't do this by yourself.<eos> That's why I'm here.<eos> Your mother had more knowledge than either of us.<eos> Yeah, and look where it got her.<eos> Did she ever mention anything to you about portals to another world?
No, there's no safe place.<eos> I know exactly where you can hide her.<eos> Where?<eos> The cabin in the woods where all of this first started.<eos> You mean where I took you to find that postman who kidnapped the little girl?
Wu and I can go to the precinct and see if the Zerstoerer came through.<eos> I'm sure, wherever it was, somebody had to notice.<eos> Yeah, I bet he's hard to miss.<eos> This can't be good.<eos> I'm taking you somewhere to hide Diana.
I'm going back to the precinct to help Hank and Wu.<eos> Call me if you need anything.<eos> I love you, son.<eos> Nick!<eos> I thought I lost you once already tonight.
Nick.<eos> I'm just so thankful you're all here.<eos> I know this isn't gonna make a lot of sense, but when I was in the Other Place, I didn't know if I'd ever get back.<eos> And I felt what it would be like to lose... all of you... everyone I ever loved... anyone who ever meant anything to me, my family.<eos> We thought we had lost you, too, man.
You don't think he's drinking again, do you?<eos> I don't know. I don't know, Mom.<eos> Well, check his bars.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Hey, do you remember the first time that your dad hit you, man?
Fuck.<eos> There we go.<eos> Got a little trash to take care of.<eos> Meg, where you been?<eos> Haven't seen you since I hit on you at that full moon party.
I'm not.<eos> Could I have, um, a fucking bottle of tequila, please?<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> I'm sorry I woke you up.<eos> I just wanted to tell you that I love you very much, honey.
No, you do it in the morning.<eos> You're okay, though?<eos> Just at work.<eos> Just working late, and I was thinking about you, and I want you to know... that I love you very much, kiddo, okay?<eos> I love you very much.
You can go back to sleep now.<eos> You've reached John Rayburn.<eos> Please leave a message.<eos> John, where the fuck are you, man?<eos> Come on. I've been calling you all fucking night.
Hey. You look like that famous professor Henry Gerard, but there's no way that guy's still teaching at his age.<eos> I don't think you could ever call what that clown did "teaching."<eos> He had his moments.<eos> Good to see you, Harvey.<eos> I'd ask you to join me for dinner, but I'm pretty sure that that's not what you came here for.
'Cause we're really shaking' a lot of hands. Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't know you were running for office.<eos> - That was a lot of handshaking. - Press the flesh.<eos> Well, I'm gonna go smoke.<eos> Nice meeting you, Pete. Yes.
As long as he thinks God's here, he's not going anywhere.<eos> I'm sure he might if he knew about your troubles.<eos> If he knew about my troubles, he'd make it a whole lot worse. - Believe me.<eos> - Why would he do that?<eos> He's your ex-fiancé, and he loves you.
If he knew about my troubles, he'd make it a whole lot worse. - Believe me.<eos> - Why would he do that?<eos> He's your ex-fiancé, and he loves you.<eos> I can't tell him.<eos> Well, then, let me help you out.
It was so much simpler when there was just one giant evil dick trying to kill us.<eos> - Now we're just...<eos> - Grown-ups.<eos> How did this happen?<eos> I have an idea... to help you.
I don't want to go back there.<eos> Marina, your clock is running out, okay?<eos> Please, you are the strongest person that I have ever met.<eos> I need you to pull it together now, and I need you to tell me.<eos> I need you to tell me about the thing that killed you.
Hey, Arsenio!<eos> Nice to see you again, kiddo.<eos> Have I seen you before?<eos> Yeah, it's Sandy Wexler.<eos> I met you at Bernie's beach house, with Doug and Danny.
I've been thinking about how you can work on your kid-friendly material.<eos> Maybe go to Magic Mountain.<eos> When you see all the children on line, just start doing jokes for 'em.<eos> - See if it works. - That feels very child molestery.<eos> He wants to ruin you.
Call my office next week. Yeah.<eos> I mean, you sure?<eos> 'Cause I will call.<eos> I know.<eos> - It was great seeing you, pal.
Let's pop by. He lives in Venice, right?<eos> Uh... no, the address is in Bel Air.<eos> Oh, so he moved?<eos> Okay, okay, he moved.<eos> They let you in this party?
- Courtney, what's wrong?<eos> I think someone's outside my house.<eos> I'm scared it's one of those freaks that's been calling me or something.<eos> What?<eos> Who's calling you?
♪ Butterflies, butterfly ♪<eos> Why the hell do you have me singing that song?<eos> - They hated it! - No.<eos> This is an awful idea, Sandy!<eos> No, I... I'm telling you, you did better than you think!
It's scary, knowing your heart's not good.<eos> Sandy Wexler, you have the biggest, best, strongest heart in this whole miserable town.<eos> And that's a fact.<eos> Miserable town?<eos> It's been quite nice to you, thank you very much.
All he wants in return is for you to be you, just the way you are, because he loves you.<eos> I love you.<eos> I've always loved you.<eos> You're my star, Courtney.<eos> I love you, too, Sandy.
Sophia, where are you?<eos> Shane just got this new game.<eos> He and Dax are totally shredding!<eos> Also, did I mention that Shane's here?<eos> Annie, I'm the one who called you.
Lots of old-school Otis Redding.<eos> None of that stuff they play on the radio.<eos> You mean like his hits?<eos> You're the funniest fucking chick on the planet.<eos> Seriously, I can listen to you all night.
Don't worry, Dad.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I like this life.<eos> Just get some rest.<eos> Mm-hm. Here, I'll help you.
And let me tell you, I charmed the hell out of him.<eos> He was all like, "Take care of Sophia." And I was all like,<eos> "Oh, well, well, well."<eos> He was like, "Hey, please, try to sell her on college.<eos> She listens to you." And I was like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah."
Mobias, where is it that you fall on the wide spectrum of sexuality and possibilities?<eos> Uh, not that it's any of your business, but typically, in the small chance that I do feel anything, I do enjoy the touch of a woman.<eos> But if you're asking my preference, hmm, that would be self-pleasure... with a bowl of room-temperature...<eos> - Got it.<eos> Glad I asked. Saved you, Gail.
I'm here now.<eos> What do you want?<eos> What do I want?<eos> Are you seriously that upset about me not hiring you?<eos> Sophia, I help you with everything.
Oh, shit.<eos> What's so funny, Topper?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> 'Cause the only thing that I think is funny is your pathetic British accent. It's almost as bad as Keith's résumé.<eos> - What the fuck did I do to you?
- Gosh!<eos> Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Oh, my... I'm so happy you are here to witness this.<eos> I mean, at first when I saw you, I thought I must be hallucinating.
I'm so stressed out.<eos> - Kaavi is just...<eos> - Who's Kaavi?<eos> The girl building our site.<eos> I told you about her last night.
What do you think?<eos> You really went for it.<eos> Yes, well, I thought it would take me years to discover my new passion, but it just took one afternoon and a trip to Party City.<eos> Is your new passion streamers?<eos> It's helping you.
Unlike forcing me to use my trip to Tinseltown to look at a house.<eos> You're being so close-minded.<eos> And you're making your gums recede, and there's no cure for that.<eos> The only way I'm gonna get through your stupid shack in the woods is if I'm high as a goddamn kite.<eos> This is moronic, and it's not like you, and I forbid you to take that acid.
I mean, most black parents are cool with stuff like that, but not my parents.<eos> I'll charm 'em.<eos> You'll see.<eos> I love you, Annie.<eos> I love you, too.
Hol-eee shit!<eos> Oh my frickin' Jeeezus, check out New Guy!<eos> Oh my god, dude!<eos> Alright, dude, I gotta ask you a question and you gotta be honest:<eos> has anyone ever told you that your face is disgusting?
Here.<eos> No more crying? Okay?<eos> 'Cause crying isn't gonna fix this.<eos> I brought you in.<eos> I trusted you, made you a part of my family.
Say it.<eos> Stop!<eos> Or what?<eos> Just... don't.<eos> What happened to you, Hitler?
Remember?<eos> Till Carlos, we had fun.<eos> Before that little thing, we were having a hell of a time.<eos> That hurt me as much as you.<eos> It hurt you, Tulip?
Okay. Look, just... tell me what you want and let's get this over with.<eos> You just had to piss him off again, didn't you?<eos> Not exactly.<eos> I'm a figment of your imagination, remember?<eos> Your brain's way of distracting yourself from all the pain, same as the last time Marcel stabbed you with that blade.
Yes, I still do have... a murderous hunger.<eos> Okay. Why do you guys even need me?<eos> Huh? I mean, I know I'm adorable, but I'm extremely small potatoes.<eos> Well, you are Marcel's trusted friend.<eos> We had planned on learning everything you know and then using you as collateral.
I have no defense.<eos> I know exactly what I am.<eos> As I know that none of us are innocent in this.<eos> Least of all you and me.<eos> I was a damn fool to ever love you.
And I could say the same.<eos> Then we are done here.<eos> We most certainly are not.<eos> You gonna use that on me?<eos> Infect me with the same hex that damn near destroyed you?
They'll be here, Kol.<eos> And while we have a moment, I wanted to say thank you.<eos> For what?<eos> For coming to get me.<eos> So I could be sitting here, annoyed at you.
All because you can.<eos> But here's the other truth.<eos> Despite being raised by you people... I am nothing like any of you.<eos> In fact, I'm proud as hell I'm not a Mikaelson.<eos> I beat you all without turning into you.
No, and now he's taken all of my friends!<eos> Stop it!<eos> And, yes, very soon, your freedom.<eos> He will marry you again, won't he?<eos> He can hardly compel you to...
I think he truly thought he had a chance of succeeding as a minister.<eos> He did have a chance, but he was not the choice.<eos> Still, I do wonder, if he might perform more energetically.<eos> Cassel is, after all, rather decrepit, is he not?<eos> You must know that I have been asked for my opinion on him and his position, and I must tell you, Sire...
I think she's rather attractive.<eos> You're jealous.<eos> Of a woman?<eos> How we laughed!<eos> I shared a bed with Henrietta and that never bothered you.
15 pairs of new breechess.<eos> How many times do I have to tell you? They are not clothes, they are costumes!<eos> They allow me to express my every mood and whim!<eos> They also cost a fortune.<eos> Since when does that concern you?
How many times do I have to tell you? They are not clothes, they are costumes!<eos> They allow me to express my every mood and whim!<eos> They also cost a fortune.<eos> Since when does that concern you?<eos> You're one of the richest men in France and it's never bothered you before!
Do I have to travel all the way from Amsterdam to find out what your plans are to defend our country from invasion?<eos> My plan is to defend my country with all the men and strength at my disposal.<eos> No doubt but a man more cynical than myself would see an ulterior motive in your silence.<eos> Such as?<eos> William, I brought you up as my own son.
You must find her!<eos> Who?<eos> It will help you.<eos> She's in a house in the square.<eos> Tell her Ariane sent you.
Jared Dunn.<eos> Yep, just a moment, please. I'll transfer you.<eos> Go for Chambers.<eos> I knew it was you.<eos> Hey, did that pussy Jared keep you on hold long?
- It's for the best.<eos> Yeah, absolutely... even though the program did show promise.<eos> Well, promising or not, it was a mistake.<eos> You're right, you're right, but... I mean, just to be clear, the mistake wasn't the program,<eos> - it was keeping the program from you.
Shall I design a dragon?<eos> No.<eos> I have something else in mind.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I'm gonna figure out what broke you.
Sorry about kicking your candy ass.<eos> You ICE'd me!<eos> She ice'd me, and now I'm aboard your War Bird!<eos> Stop being a whiny little bitch.<eos> We brought you here for your own protection.
Ward... my dad they're all the same. It keeps happening.<eos> I don't see it that way.<eos> Come on, Jemma.<eos> You know that it's true.<eos> Yes, they betrayed you.
I don't see it that way.<eos> Come on, Jemma.<eos> You know that it's true.<eos> Yes, they betrayed you.<eos> And after everything you've been through, no one would blame you if you put up your own firewall.
What, are you kidding?<eos> I've never seen this guy before in my life.<eos> You want the book?<eos> Let him go.<eos> - What did they do to you, man?
Help!<eos> May!<eos> What ...<eos> What happened?<eos> Le me help you. Okay.
What do you mean, "hope"?<eos> They'll say we're Life Model Decoys, turn all of HQ against us, and have us killed.<eos> Okay. Well... maybe there's not a lot of hope that we're gonna get out of here, but there is hope... that our team is still alive.<eos> Which means we have to try.<eos> From what Fitz told you, it seems Radcliffe, in his... twisted logic, is keeping them alive in this Framework thing.
What are you doing?<eos> You're on another planet this morning.<eos> Look...<eos> I get it.<eos> You put yourself out there last night, and I let you down.
Hey, you ever finish the Saunders report?<eos> Of course you did.<eos> I'm gonna check my e-mail.<eos> Why?<eos> Anyone who's e-mailing you is gonna be in the briefing.
Daisy, they're coming.<eos> You need to do something before psycho stalker shoots us!<eos> Stop it!<eos> Stop it! Ward, look at me.<eos> I have never betrayed you, ever.
I'll be in and out. No one will even know I'm there.<eos> It's only a matter of time before we find her.<eos> We've detained several Inhuman sympath... dismissed, agent.<eos> All this for one subversive?<eos> Why won't you let me help you?
It's over.<eos> This isn't the world I'd intended.<eos> Things have gone dreadfully wrong.<eos> Maybe not so much for you.<eos> I promise you, this is a gilded cage.
They mean to destroy us.<eos> She lies because I'm right.<eos> She's trying to deceive you.<eos> I love you.<eos> They're trying to take you away from me.
You mean our world?<eos> Don't try that ploy with me.<eos> I know you replaced the real Skye.<eos> Replaced?<eos> Is that what she told you?
Everyone needs the strap across their back now and again.<eos> Teaches respect.<eos> You know that.<eos> You've felt it.<eos> And look where it's gotten you.
This machine can build you a body in the other world.<eos> You can have a second life or a third or however many you want.<eos> That's up to you.<eos> Immortality.<eos> If that sort of thing appeals to you... yeah.
Admittedly, it doesn't sound great when you say it like that.<eos> You lied to me.<eos> Mack... No, don't try to talk your way out of this.<eos> You're a damn liar.<eos> My daughter looks up to you, and for what?
We need to get out of here.<eos> Actually, I was thinking we might try to find another way through the back door.<eos> I still believe Daisy's right.<eos> Wake up!<eos> There is no back door, just like she's not Moses about to take you to the Promised Land.
Hello, Jemma Simmons.<eos> Seems you finally found me.<eos> - You don't get to say my name... not after everything you've done.<eos> It wasn't supposed to be like this.<eos> Aida... she took you from me, and I came here to rescue you.
She doesn't know what happened.<eos> I was waiting till tomorrow to tell her, but I guess I don't have to now.<eos> Hey. Hey, look who's here.<eos> Dad.<eos> I tried waiting up for you.
Hey, me and Ayesha got a couple of days off. We're going down to the Albany in the Bahamas.<eos> Hey, Spence. Grab a girl, come with us.<eos> Well, I'll tell you right now, Ayesha, I'm a little light on travel companions these days.<eos> Spence, don't play me.<eos> You know I saw you on your game the other night at International Smoke.
How about yourself?<eos> Oh, what?<eos> So you're not 7'9" and the only thing you dribble is Don Julio?<eos> So what?<eos> Wayne Hastings should fucking blow you for all the money you've lost at his tables.
Let me buy you two lunch.<eos> Prime rib is a specialty of the house, which I recommend served rare.<eos> And I hope you brought your appetite, because you are not gonna wanna miss that pecan pie.<eos> Jeannie?<eos> I've been looking for you everywhere.
_ _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> I don't remember inviting you.
I'm gonna make it right, Sally.<eos> - Hey. - I gotta... I gotta pay for what I did.<eos> We're gonna get you home.<eos> We're gonna figure this out in the mornin'.<eos> Hey. - I love you.
We're down to two girls.<eos> This move is too much risk.<eos> Lydia Quigley has her girls sucking the law, the clergy, and the whole King's bench!<eos> If she kicks me, I'll bite her back.<eos> So what brought you to London?
From Lord Repton.<eos> So that's twice for your maidenhead.<eos> - For you.<eos> - Garters, we made them.<eos> To welcome you to the ranks.
She's dead.<eos> My mother commands my presence.<eos> You're leaving me, again?<eos> I must, in case the hag has left me any coinage.<eos> Haxby will escort you while I'm gone.
I am Lucy Wells.<eos> Famed courtesan.<eos> Give me your money and I'll make you a man.<eos> What use is moaning?<eos> I've saved you from a life of drudgery.
Look how much money the gentlemen paid, more than you'd earn in a year as a housemaid.<eos> Oh, enough whining!<eos> I'm having a dreadful day.<eos> Stop that noise!<eos> Now... this lady will take you to your new place of work and give you a nice room and a pretty dress.
They pick away at your merits as though they're...<eos> They're born out of pain... from sewing her own cunny up.<eos> ... is the she-witch, Margaret Wells.<eos> Is he to be my keeper?<eos> He was very keen to have you, but... when I questioned him further about his finances, he fell far short.
It's time for you to leave.<eos> Sir George, may I present Mr. D...<eos> Leave.<eos> I haven't finished playing.<eos> Well, I'm ordering you back to the house.
Pleasure, treasure, and carnage.<eos> I've always wanted to fuck royalty.<eos> Your dusky queen is too delicious to resist.<eos> Four guineas for royalty.<eos> I was determined to be the first... to have you.
For my pain.<eos> Here... have some.<eos> Let me.<eos> Not too much.<eos> Did she hurt you very much?
Chapter five, verse three.<eos> "For the lips of a strange woman<eos> "drop as honeycomb,<eos> "and her mouth is smoother than oil."<eos> See how they draw you in.
I'm leaving.<eos> I say when you leave!<eos> You will know your place.<eos> You will...<eos> I'm taking you to dinner tonight, so you have to behave.
I'm sorry, Ma.<eos> I'll do better next time.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> He wants you!<eos> He called you a goddess.
- I want her.<eos> I want her!<eos> Emily Lacey is laughing at your fate.<eos> Mumma, she can't have known what would happen.<eos> She would have killed you stone dead if it had suited her purpose.
This baby's almost ready to be born.<eos> It can't be, that's not right.<eos> Here's its head.<eos> And there's its back.<eos> Who can help you, Fanny?
- I want to be a partner.<eos> - Partner?<eos> Yes.<eos> I figured out what I want, and I want to be a partner at this firm.<eos> Donna, I don't mean to insult you, but you're not even a lawyer.
oh, dear god.<eos> you got this. Okay?<eos> Remember, just hold your breath.<eos> And I love you.<eos> I love you, too.
"Rachel envied her sister and said unto Jacob,<eos> "'Give me children or else I die.'"<eos> Fred.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Let me help you.
I couldn't sleep at all last night.<eos> - Neither could I.<eos> - Tara, please.<eos> I know we had a fight, but you told me you wanted to get to know me.<eos> And I swear, what I told you was the worst thing I've ever done.
When this thing is over, I am not coming back here.<eos> - Mike--<eos> - I told you, I want to do good.<eos> - Then do good here.<eos> - And I also told you that the only reason I agreed to this whole thing in the first place was because I couldn't stand to watch someone like Oliver fail and not be able to help him.
Then you're not just an asshole.<eos> You're an idiot, because there's no way Mike Ross ever agrees to trading you for him.<eos> - Well, I'll make him agree. - No, you won't.<eos> Mike.<eos> Harvey, whatever deal she's offering you, I'm not gonna take it.
And a good line never gets old.<eos> - Tell that to your hairline.<eos> - Tell that to your waistline.<eos> - Good to see you, Harvey.<eos> What brings you down?
- And you're scared of losing your friend.<eos> - What do I do?<eos> - I can't tell you that, Louis, but I can tell you it was your behavior that drove Tara away, and, if you keep letting your emotions dictate your behavior, you won't need to worry about being replaced.<eos> You'll drive Harvey away all by yourself.<eos> - I'm not sure I've ever seen you here this late.
- You haven't signed the partnership agreement yet, so I can refund your money, and...<eos> - I don't want a refund.<eos> - I want what we agreed to.<eos> - I can't do that.<eos> You are not a lawyer, and being partner at a law firm... It means something, inside the firm and out, which is why I wrote up a new release for you.
You want to put the janitor in charge of bankruptcy?<eos> Or the guard downstairs could be head of litigation.<eos> - Are you finished?<eos> - Depends on what you say next.<eos> - I'm sorry I said those things about you, and I want you to know I didn't mean any of them.
- There always is.<eos> - I'm still bringing Alex over, only not as a name partner, but Pfizer's still insisting we drop Jim Reynolds.<eos> - And you want to know if I'm okay with it?<eos> - No, I'm letting him go.<eos> I'm just calling you to tell you before I tell him, like I should've done in the first place.
My name. It's June.<eos> Luke. Do you know a woman named June Osborn?<eos> - Yes, my wife.<eos> - This is for you.<eos> I love you so much.
Okay, stop!<eos> Just go home and just do what they say.<eos> Moira, I thought you were dead.<eos> I thought they killed you.<eos> I thought they strung you up somewhere.
Listen to me.<eos> Janine, you have to do what's best for your daughter now.<eos> You have to give her the chance to grow up.<eos> Mommy loves you.<eos> Mommy loves you so much.

- Just... find out where the revenants have gone.<eos> We need to make sure that they're... not regrouping or planning something.<eos> Hey, can I... can I talk to you? Somewhere private?<eos> OK, when was the last time you slept slash ate slash applied deodorant?<eos> Did Bobo do something to you?
- Good.<eos> Good?<eos> How the hell are we gonna get home?<eos> Doc...<eos> Did Dolls... say any... did he tell you to...
No, you had to.<eos> I wanted you to.<eos> Of course.<eos> I didn't have a choice, right?<eos> He would've killed you.
Give us your left hand!<eos> Look, pens, yeah?<eos> You... sign your name.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Let's help you out, you half-wit.
And we think you know where he is.<eos> So let's see what Mr Clarke's been up to.<eos> A scuzzy dickhead like Dwayne Clarke can afford a motor like this, and I'm on a poxy scooter!<eos> I don't know no Eddie.<eos> We saw you with him, idiot.
With me.<eos> All right?<eos> Hi.<eos> Make sure nobody goes into the bedrooms before I do.<eos> One of the lads saw you and Bradfield outside the section house the other night.
And I've just broken out of prison.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Okay.<eos> What are you gonna do with me?<eos> Uh... Uh, I guess we'll, uh, take you over to Max.
Sothat'sit .<eos> Ilearnedplayingwithwomen's hearts is a dangerous game.<eos> Andit'swrongtotake advantage of the elderly.<eos> And Grampa?<eos> I'm sorry I embarrassed you on Grandparents' Day.
You thumped one melon and left the store satisfied.<eos> If you knew anything about me, you would know I would never, ever shop in the produce section.<eos> Homer, have you ever thought there might have been other melons... bigger, smaller, more exciting?<eos> Oh, the women I could have had.<eos> You drew me in fifth grade, and I've never gotten over you.
Marge, I treasure you.<eos> And to prove it, here's something I drew last night.<eos> Okay, we haven't achieved all our dreams, but the day I met you, I had them.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too.
I love you so much.
I'm still in bed, actually.<eos> I got the same table as last year. It's gonna be perfect.<eos> I know. I can't wait to see you.<eos> I know.<eos> I love you too.
I got the same table as last year. It's gonna be perfect.<eos> I know. I can't wait to see you.<eos> I know.<eos> I love you too.<eos> I love you so much.
I love you so much.<eos> I just carry it around in my heart all day, knowing that you love me.<eos> Makes me so happy.<eos> People are here. I can't do that for you right now.<eos> I love you too, Schbeebs.
- I love you too. - Aw.<eos> This is exactly what - I wanted for my birthday.<eos> - Oh, me too, Mama.<eos> You're the best mama in the whole world. - Aw.<eos> - I love you so much.
Every married woman knows, if a man tries to give you a look, you look away.<eos> I got plenty of looks.<eos> They'd look, I'd look away.<eos> Yeah, well, she didn't look away, Mom.<eos> This is why we sent you to Christian camp and Christian college, so... so these things wouldn't happen to you.
Boy, you kids sure do love your vegetables.<eos> Here you go, Brian.<eos> Hello, Diane.<eos> And we try so hard to keep rats out of the cafeteria.<eos> What brings you to Carl's Jr.
It doesn't matter who's to blame.<eos> We just need to get back to Earth.<eos> Aliens brought those people to this planet, and we're gonna find out why and save them.<eos> Um, could you maybe just think about saving us for a second?<eos> No one told you to come here.
Well, I am.<eos> So you still feeling betwixt and between?<eos> - No, no, I feel amazing.<eos> - Good, good.<eos> So what brings you by?
I think... I think we ditched her.<eos> Okay, quick question, Ray.<eos> Your lady dinosaur friend, you said she recognized your scent.<eos> Wait, I believe her name was Gertrude.<eos> Right, I couldn't help but get the feeling that Gertrude didn't like you very much.
Previously on Supergirl...<eos> - You're a white Martian?<eos> - I am not like them.<eos> You need to believe me.<eos> I spared you so you can rot in a cell for all eternity.
I'll see you in a minute.<eos> Supergirl, behind you!<eos> Go with them.<eos> Go, go, go.<eos> - Let me help you!
I don't want to forgive her.<eos> Why?<eos> Hate becomes your reason for living when you've lost everything that you love.<eos> If I find that there was some good in their kind, I don't hate her.<eos> Forgiveness isn't something that you give to somebody who's hurt you.
Are you working with me because you like me?<eos> I don't know what to tell you, okay?<eos> I want to work with you, Kara!<eos> And that is it!<eos> I'm sorry if that disappoints you.
Stupid, but nice.<eos> You're not looking so hot, blondie.<eos> I'll warm you up.<eos> You could kill me.<eos> For all the things you think I stole from you.
Mike...<eos> - Eve!<eos> Hi. - Hi.<eos> It's so funny, Mike, that you're here.<eos> I was going to call you later to talk about something, but...
To most people, I'm a reporter at CatCo Worldwide Media.<eos> But in secret, I work with my adoptive sister for the DEO to protect my city from alien life and anyone else that means to cause it harm.<eos> I am Supergirl.<eos> Previously on Supergirl...<eos> We salvaged you and resurrected you.
On Daxam, it really seemed to cut back on recidivism.<eos> Uh, well, that kind of punishment actually went away a long time ago.<eos> That's too bad.<eos> Yeah, I haven't, uh...<eos> Haven't seen you in a while.
Everyone in National City has got an opinion about me.<eos> Ungrateful daughter, heroine, bitch.<eos> Ugh.<eos> And they've all called for a quote.<eos> Not you though, Snapper Carr hasn't sent you here to shake me down.
The only time you ever tell me you love me is when you need something from me.<eos> I know I wasn't the greatest mother, but I did the best that I could.<eos> By making me feel unwanted.<eos> - You don't want to believe it, but I always tried to protect you.<eos> If Dad could hear you now.
They paid her off.<eos> Your father came back to try and rebuild our marriage.<eos> Then when you were four, we heard your mother had died.<eos> The state was going to put you in foster care.<eos> Your father brought you home and we adopted you.
(EXHALES)<eos> Ah.<eos> "Were," as in past tense.<eos> Right?<eos> As in, she told you that the date didn't actually go well.
And for the piece de resistance...<eos> The ring!<eos> Kara, sweetie, it's like I said.<eos> I'm your one true love, your soulmate, your one true pairing as the kids say.<eos> My name is Mxyzptlk and I love you, Kara Zor-El.
Who can come to her aid when villains suddenly pop up.<eos> Wait... Parasite...<eos> This was all you?<eos> Don't you... Don't you see what he's doing here?<eos> He's creating havoc so that he can play the hero and then impress you.
Stop. Stop.<eos> Enough. Mon-El, get out of here. Go.<eos> Me?<eos> What about him?<eos> I told you I was handling this, now go.
Or things will get very bad for your world.<eos> Hey. I cannot believe you sided with that fast-talking, nefarious twerp.<eos> I did not side with him.<eos> You sent me away so you could have private time with your stalker!<eos> I sent him away so that he didn't snap you off to Siberia, and plus, you were being out of control!
The pigs in blankets?<eos> See, that's the thing, Mxy.<eos> I'm not going to marry you.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> - I brought you to the Fortress in case you got violent again.
It's not going to work between us.<eos> Ever.<eos> But you said...<eos> You don't love me?<eos> Love isn't making demands of someone, or forcing them to marry you.
Anyway...<eos> I'll get... I'll get out of your hair.<eos> Wait. Don't go yet. Please.<eos> I get that you were upset that I wasn't listening to you and I...<eos> I tried really, really, really hard to listen to you this time.
No.<eos> It's not possible.<eos> That time, it's gone.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I mean that I love you and I have missed you every day.
So, you think Jeremiah is...<eos> It's just... He is somebody that we need to keep our guard up around.<eos> At least until we know exactly what he's has been doing for the past 15 years.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay. I'll help you.
I know you're upset with Mon-El.<eos> And you have every right to be.<eos> Okay? Own it.<eos> I just... I hate him right now.<eos> I get it, and I hate that he hurt you, but relationships have their ups and downs, Kara.
Why did you con me?<eos> That gang.<eos> My brother, bastian, works for them, but he hasn't been carrying his weight.<eos> I told them I'd clear his debt.<eos> I didn't want to use you.
And I love being a hero because it means I get to spend every single day by your side.<eos> And I love the way that you're honest to a fault.<eos> And the way that you fight for those you care for.<eos> And I love you.<eos> With everything that I have, I love you.
She did what's best for you.<eos> It was never going to last.<eos> Yeah, did you tell her that?<eos> Enough about the Kryptonian girl.<eos> You have nothing tethering you here.
Mother?<eos> Father?<eos> We finally found you.<eos> Return with us to Daxam.<eos> That Kryptonian girl has poisoned you.
It's been 45 minutes.<eos> I'm sure there's a good reason she's not here.<eos> It's okay, Alex.<eos> Look, I feel bad.<eos> I can see it was an awkward thing that I pushed you into and now... No.
What about Maggie?<eos> And all the things you said to her back then...<eos> That wasn't painful?<eos> Anything I said to her, she had coming.<eos> She dedicated five years of her life to you and you bailed on her.
Anything I said to her, she had coming.<eos> She dedicated five years of her life to you and you bailed on her.<eos> I bailed on her?<eos> Seriously?<eos> That's what she told you?
I'm...<eos> We'll talk later.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Where is she?<eos> What did she do to you?
So, how'd it go?<eos> Good.<eos> Thank you for making me do that.<eos> You guys talking about me at the end there?<eos> Yeah. She said how lucky I am to have you.
Yeah, me either.<eos> But not for long.<eos> I mean...<eos> I knew I couldn't let that happen.<eos> And I'm sorry I forced you to talk to your mom.
Thursday morning knife practice.<eos> Well, what am I supposed to do?<eos> Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh! Fifth time's a charm.<eos> Why can't I do it?<eos> Hey! What brings you to the rent-controlled side of town?
He has a house an hour outside the city.<eos> Malverne.<eos> Why does that sound so familiar?<eos> Because he grew up in Midvale.<eos> She can't hear you, Kara.
I pretended to be of this world but only because I know how much your mother loathes aliens.<eos> And I presumed you'd be the same.<eos> That's what people do when they hear I'm a Luthor.<eos> They presume.<eos> Everything else I told you was the truth.
I shouldn't have rushed in.<eos> I made things worse. I...<eos> Maggie was upset and she was frustrated and she lashed out at you.<eos> You only did what you thought was best to protect your sister.<eos> No one can blame you for that.
We've been in here a long time.<eos> You must be hungry.<eos> Mmm. This is a really good burger.<eos> I know you don't wanna be here with me.<eos> I'm just trying to help you, Marcus.
Kara has done nothing.<eos> Okay?<eos> This is all you!<eos> Oh, of course you're there with her.<eos> The Kryptonian girl who bewitched you.
Ah, the robbers, the liars, the killers.<eos> The elite who once led our people to greatness.<eos> Here, we can rebuild again, and make way for the rest of our ravaged population to settle once and for all.<eos> If you think that the people of Earth will just lay down and take this, you are wrong, because they are made of stronger stuff than you think.<eos> And besides, Kara will stop you.
Oh, my God, the President is an alien!<eos> I assume that you are all a little frightened, but I assure you, I mean you no harm.<eos> Otherwise I would have been stabbed in the back by you that night at college when your fiance flung himself at me.<eos> Clearly, she's a pacifist.<eos> And darling, I love you just the way you are, scales and all.
I thought you'd finally see my side.<eos> Well, now what are we gonna do? Lillian betraying us wasn't the biggest shock ever.<eos> So, Winn bugged Henshaw and rigged a remote so I could beam us back if she double-crossed us.<eos> Hope for the best...<eos> Your stubborn pride still blinds you to the truth.
I won't.<eos> Kyle, I'm not asking.<eos> If there's one thing in this world I care more about than you, it's the Institute.<eos> Don't ask me to choose.<eos> I made you and I love you, but I will end you in a heartbeat if I have to.
Shit, it actually works.<eos> Hands-free, baby.<eos> In the Maserati.<eos> Well, I'm glad you called, because I have spent the day doing a full analysis on my life in general, and I've come to the conclusion that you are amazing, and I am so lucky to have you<eos> and to love you... and it has nothing to do with the car, even though the car is, like, completely insane.
Good.<eos> Yeah, good.<eos> Just wanted to call and say break a leg.<eos> - I love you.<eos> - I love you, too.
You can forgive him a bit of wanderlust.<eos> I don't see you packing your bags.<eos> Nik, you do not need me anymore.<eos> I know that I'm your favorite sibling, and of course<eos> I adore you.
I was wrong when I said that you were a Mikaelson.<eos> You're not a Mikaelson.<eos> You don't have a Mikaelson heart.<eos> There's just too muchmuood in you.<eos> It's why I love you.
You're not a Mikaelson.<eos> You don't have a Mikaelson heart.<eos> There's just too muchmuood in you.<eos> It's why I love you.<eos> I love you, too.
I'm still so cold.<eos> Are the birds gone?<eos> Yeah. They're gone, sweetheart.<eos> And when you're better, which will be soon, you and I are going to share the biggest plate of beignets you've ever seen.<eos> And you can tell me where in this big, wide world you'd like me to take you next.
Is this for me?<eos> Oh, sweet angel of mercy.<eos> Mmm.<eos> This almost makes up for the whole kidnapping thing.<eos> Oh, let's not forget, that whole kidnapping thing kept you alive.
Did you not learn your lesson the last time I put you down?<eos> Does this bravado help to relieve your pathetic fear?<eos> Oh, you think I'm afraid of you?<eos> Terrified.<eos> I put you down twice before.
I'll give you an hour.<eos> And something else.<eos> The means to kill the unkillable king of New Orleans.<eos> If Marcel comes after you, use this.<eos> Oh. You're mad I kept a secret from you?
If this is all in my head,<eos> I could just as easily wish your ass away.<eos> Your wishes won't bring back the dead.<eos> Nor will they grant you solace.<eos> Let's not forget, Elijah killed you as well.
Your wishes won't bring back the dead.<eos> Nor will they grant you solace.<eos> Let's not forget, Elijah killed you as well.<eos> Can you close your eyes and wish that away?<eos> I betrayed you without a second thought.
From the Viking witch who spends her days channeling evil spirits to save vampire brothers?<eos> Yeah, you got a concussion.<eos> Sometimes...<eos> I'm forced to do things that I... regret.<eos> And... for what I did to you...
Really? Kol, you better undo this right now.<eos> I'm sorry, Rebekah.<eos> I truly am.<eos> Why are you helping her?<eos> What has she done to you?
I married you.<eos> But you were in love with him.<eos> [scoffs]<eos> I mean, it's an old, sad story.<eos> The monsters treated you like crap, turned you into a girl who loves monsters.
Thank you.<eos> ♪ Over my heart... ♪<eos> I love you.<eos> ♪ I want you to close my eyes... ♪<eos> I love you, too.
I know what I have to do.<eos> I just have to be brave enough to do it.<eos> ♪ ♪<eos> I saw the light under your door.<eos> Your mother told me she tucked you in.
Your blood on my hands and I... couldn't save you.<eos> Hey. You got me.<eos> Exhausted, but still alive.<eos> Right in front of you.<eos> I just kept thinking about all the things I didn't tell you.
Everything's okay now, I promise.<eos> Can I go back to my drawing?<eos> Sure, yeah.<eos> Hey. What... what happened?<eos> Hey. The Hollow's magic put you in a coma.
Elijah?<eos> Things between us are complicated.<eos> Well, that's a word often used to describe my brother.<eos> But his feelings for you are quite simple.<eos> He adores you, Hayley.
I was a very different creature.<eos> I was cruel.<eos> I was mean.<eos> And I would revel in the terror which I inspired in others.<eos> But, Hope, from the moment I saw you,
Arréter majik sa a!<eos> No!<eos> That anger that you're feeling right now, that's called losing.<eos> Because after this you're never ever gonna be able to lock yourself inside of Hope Mikaelson.<eos> And once I put you inside of this book, you're never gonna be able to get out again, so arréter majik sa a.
- Where you going?<eos> - To find my daughter.<eos> How are you going to do that?<eos> - We'll figure it out.<eos> - Let me help you.
You think you can stop me?<eos> I'm not gonna let you take her.<eos> Ah. You're okay.<eos> You're all right.<eos> Some witches, um, they found you on the street, they called me and I brought you here.
We need allies.<eos> Hayley, I can't undo the things I've...<eos> - Elijah... - No.<eos> I can't stop being... this.<eos> I also can't stop loving you.
Whatever we are, you and me... we were doomed.<eos> I could never be what you needed me to be.<eos> Best thing I could do for you is disappear.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too.
Father!<eos> Let it go.<eos> Always and forever.<eos> Your Aunt Rebekah... asked me to give you this.<eos> She loves you so much.
She loves you so much.<eos> Family heirlooms are... very important.<eos> They remind us where we come from, and that no matter where we go, our family is with us.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too, Aunt Freya.
You never said good-bye.<eos> Figured you'd be busy with your plaything, Sabrina.<eos> Sofya is gone for good.<eos> Well, that's a pity.<eos> But I hope you didn't come all of this way because your mercenary girlfriend dumped you.
For instance, don't you find it odd that the Mikaelsons are hosting a party with Marcel, yet no one's seen him in over 24 hours?<eos> Because he's locked in a dungeon?<eos> After Marcel went missing, some construction guys sealed off the tunnels under Rousseau's.<eos> So, you know... one plus one equals captured.<eos> They invited you, hoping to sell the illusion it was Marcel's idea.
Do we understand each other?<eos> They threatened me, they threatened my child.<eos> Bloodshed is inevitable.<eos> And if Hope should ever find out?<eos> She worships you, Niklaus.
Where might I find him, by the way?<eos> Oh, alas.<eos> He's been detained.<eos> Funny, he didn't come home last night either.<eos> Well, perhaps he's simply avoiding you.
How do you fight that?<eos> I think we need more padding.<eos> Like a base layer.<eos> You know, like a... like a tarp or something.<eos> Whoa. I didn't even ask you to move in, Pipes.
Really?<eos> Way to keep it classy, perra.<eos> - That hoo-ha out, too? Shit.<eos> - I put it all out.<eos> Um, can I help you with something?
Now, say goodbye and walk the fuck away, son.<eos> God.<eos> Now the Estée Lauder makeup bag is our final offer and if you act now we'll throw in, uh, lightly used Invisalign braces.<eos> Oh, wait. For what size mouth?<eos> Mmm. They might work for you, gappy.
Uh, Janae!<eos> Over here.<eos> This is Courtney, your buddy for the day.<eos> Courtney, Janae.<eos> We are so glad to have you here.
In English, it's "Thick Hair."<eos> - Yours?<eos> - Tiehteti taiboo.<eos> "Pathetic White Boy."<eos> Now, what is the name your mother gave you?
Yeah!<eos> I told you, these people make it almost too easy.<eos> Come on, peaches.<eos> Don't worry, we'll bring you back.<eos> Just gonna borrow you for a couple of hours.
Bitch!<eos> Come on!<eos> Do it!<eos> Go on, you bitch!<eos> Did they hurt you?
It's the Nomads, they raided us.<eos> Quinn always kept my father's people protected.<eos> And now you need my protection.<eos> You're my mother.<eos> Of course I'll help you.
I'll hit the Badlands eventually.<eos> All right.<eos> Fine!<eos> Talked me into it.<eos> This is the last time I'm helping you out.
- Good day.<eos> Now Yeardley is here and Farlow's position is powerless, so he feels he must retrieve it.<eos> Really, my dear, please.<eos> You must search for it.<eos> As the Recorder, you regularly go into Farlow's home and the Governor has already asked you to monitor him.
We don't know that yet.<eos> You believe there's demons up there?<eos> I don't doubt it.<eos> If we find gold, demons are sure to appear.<eos> Did they tell you where the caves were?
How do you get up and go to work?<eos> Patient concierge...<eos> Fixes me up with a room and an I.V.<eos> Forty-five minutes, and I rebound like an undergrad.<eos> I'm sending you somewhere.
Look, it's Wags.<eos> - Hey, Wags, how...<eos> - It's Wags.<eos> Wags, where you been?<eos> Wags, I've been calling you.
Thing is, he's a great guy.<eos> I love him.<eos> When I landed my job here, I thought,<eos> "Damn, I finally crept ahead."<eos> But if I tell you what he's got, you'll love him.
He was there, but he wasn't there... a carcass with no further purpose.<eos> What you saw would have brought up issues of mortality and diminished utility for anyone.<eos> You saw your hero, a man you deemed better than you, laid low.<eos> That's empathy.<eos> Why did his plight cut you so deep?
The old Malachi Crunch.<eos> The market is shifting already.<eos> It is done.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> Larry... in a few moments, the FBI are gonna come walking through that door and they're going to arrest you.
- Oh. Yeah. Yeah.<eos> - See right here on Tinder, we matched.<eos> - Right.<eos> - Awesome.<eos> And then, I texted you, "Hi."
Yeah.<eos> I'm also good at cunnilingus.<eos> Well, that's good to know.<eos> So, which way do you go now?<eos> "You can talk, but no one hears you."
Tim Sanford from Playwrights Horizons read one of my plays and he gave me an encouraging response.<eos> This is huge.<eos> Oh, that is so cool.<eos> - Are you masturbating right now?<eos> - Yeah. Okay, next time I call you when you're doing that, - just don't answer the phone.
And we have a long feud going back... centuries, and centuries, and centuries.<eos> Yes, and for some reason, we always seem to run in circles which is why we've been feuding for so long.<eos> Yes, this is a cosmic dance between two people.<eos> Two people who don't know how to fight.<eos> But I came here today to tell you... that I love you.
Look, man, I... I don't want to make this weird or anything, but, um...<eos> Mandy sent me down here to see if you want to, like, come upstairs and talk or something.<eos> What?<eos> Why?<eos> We saw you out here circling around the block, it's...
I love you.<eos> Madison, I know.<eos> You made me see that the one could be anyone.<eos> As long as there's love.<eos> And having you by my side is what completes me.
Oh, my God!<eos> - Is this real?<eos> - It's so real.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I love you so much.
I know?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> No, it's okay.<eos> I'm all right.<eos> I'll call you.
Did you see that in a movie or something?<eos> Megan, you've got to make him believe you or nobody else will.<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah, I'm great.<eos> So the car will pick you up here, take you to the hangar, and they'll have you in New York in five hours or your money back.
I have to go to Anaheim.<eos> Somehow convince this MacPherson woman not to sell the story Kyle's been dying to direct to another studio.<eos> DeAnn, you're not ready.<eos> Trust me.<eos> We took you way past your comfort zone.
While we traditionally think of clogs as wooden, they were originally made of clay.<eos> That's fascinating.<eos> Oh, my God, it all connects.<eos> Um, listen, work's taking longer than I expected, so I might not be home for supper.<eos> Uh, well, whenever you're done, uh, there will be a seat waiting for you at the Ken Burns Theater.
No touching.<eos> Jason sends his love.<eos> Be nice to see him.<eos> He'll come next time, I promise.<eos> So, Kevin, this is Emma Banville, the lawyer I told you about.
If you want Hunter arrested, you're gonna need more.<eos> You hear that, Tico?<eos> Got to get me a face-to-face, pal.<eos> No, you-you think Hunter's just gonna sell to anyone?<eos> Well, he sells to you, doesn't he?
Now, Tico, I'm getting real tired of this.<eos> It was him.<eos> He told me.<eos> He's lying.<eos> - What did he tell you?
Perhaps I might stay and not be married.<eos> Come on.<eos> Samuel, I wish you to reconsider if you truly would like me to be your groomsman.<eos> I insist.<eos> If you were to invite the governor to accompany you up the aisle, I feel confident that your betrothed would recover in time for your wedding.
Not many people could see the kindness in my brother.<eos> He wouldn't let them.<eos> I did.<eos> I saw it my whole life.<eos> And that's why I love you.
You should be afraid.<eos> Mercy.<eos> I'm sorry, sir.<eos> I-I can't seem to get myself up.<eos> Mercy, let me help you.
Militia man don't sound so grand as being a soldier... but it's the same thing.<eos> We don't have a uniform no more, we work as farm hands, but when we're called upon, we are the army.<eos> Hey! Get off!<eos> Jeez, Fletcher, you're like a slubbering cock-dog.<eos> We shall have to tame you, boy.
I understand you blaming me, if it saved your life.<eos> But you could tell the truth now, can't you?<eos> You can tell me you're sorry.<eos> I never know you had it in you.<eos> Why didn't the Marshall not bring a charge against you, huh?
We're closed.<eos> I feel sick that I stood there and gave the blame of it all to you.<eos> I regret what I did to this place.<eos> There ain't no sense in kicking a tavern to hell.<eos> Did the Marshall put you up to it?
It is true.<eos> Every one of you, it's over, get back to work.<eos> We will have order here.<eos> Oh, Bailey, you sweet boy.<eos> What have they done to you?
Do you hear me?<eos> No more thieving.<eos> I hear you.<eos> Verity, what if it's Henry comes down that river, not Silas?<eos> There's a thought to rob you of sleep.
A man can't lose a ruff.<eos> Yes, I lashed my servant but he promised he had not mislaid it.<eos> I have a brooch and a sash both missing.<eos> No-one here would dare steal.<eos> When you first came here I warned you, if you take what is not yours I will report you to the Marshall.
Me?<eos> This weirdo shows up in his underpants and when we ask him to put some clothes on, he threatens to beat us up!<eos> What? I...<eos> No, no, no. That's not true!<eos> And he called you a "fat Beardo!"
You snuck to Player Expo, too.<eos> You're in as much trouble as I am.<eos> No way. I've spent years lowering Mom and Dad's expectations.<eos> They expect this kind of stuff from me, but not you.<eos> I mean, sure, Mom makes you read word books and bans you from devices cause she wants you to live a "happy life."
For finally being an amazing team.<eos> I'm so proud of all of you.<eos> And of Meg, who's not here.<eos> But cheers, and thanks for the first leg, Izzy.<eos> We've adored you, and we're going to miss you massively.
Did you know they log your mail in prison?<eos> That's how we know that two years ago, you received a letter from Topher.<eos> We found the original on Topher's laptop.<eos> "Mitch. I'm writing to apologize."<eos> "You deserve to know that I'm the one who turned you in to the DEA."
- Mmm-hmm. When I was feeding him.<eos> Epic conversations. Mostly about the merits of frozen versus fresh mice and why Mike Powell never loved me back.<eos> You cold-blooded for sure.<eos> Nobody asked you, Hufflepuff.<eos> White girl hitting you with some mad expelliarmus!
- Yeah, all right.<eos> But if she start yelling "cunt," I'm callin' me a Catholic.<eos> - So you're looking for painters?<eos> - Not exclusively.<eos> It's really whatever inspires you.
Paolo's too embarrassed to even look at me.<eos> And I had to pretend I got detention during lunch 'cause I didn't have no one to sit with.<eos> That's it?<eos> Shit.<eos> I thought that pervert PE teacher with the glasses touched you again.
-What?<eos> Yo, this bitch lied to me twice!<eos> Aleida, calm down.<eos> I'm staring at my daughter in handcuffs right now!<eos> I ask you to look out for her and the next thing I know she's shooting somebody and confesses?
-Let me guess-- -Missing.<eos> I didn't know that Piscatella paid such close attention to your social circles.<eos> This is serious, damn it!<eos> Red, I wanna believe you, but you're making it impossible.<eos> Did you ever think that maybe your prison pals are avoiding you because you're being, like, an aggro psychopants?
I'm not sure she was ready for the transition.<eos> Excuse me, I purchased that baton.<eos> We let her believe that she's running the place.<eos> - Mmm...<eos> Hey, whatever gets you through the day.
And clowns can't help it!<eos> They're just doing their job!<eos> My face is wrong.<eos> My face... is under... the wrong.<eos> Love the face God gave you, Suzanne.
-Insatiable appetite, huh?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> I think that's when she gave up trying to fix me.<eos> Thank God she did, huh?<eos> Look, you're perfect like God made you.
Okay.<eos> I'll work on it.<eos> Hey, girl, what happened to your face?<eos> - Your friend, the feral one?<eos> - Ah. She's mad at me. She thinks I stole you or something.
Yeah, I'll be right back.<eos> - Lourdes?<eos> - Gloria.<eos> They're taking him into surgery.<eos> If you want to talk to him first, I thought... maybe he can hear you.
- Yes.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Baby?<eos> Hi, baby.<eos> I know you don't like it when I call you that, but you're still my baby.
I ain't never gonna tell you that again after this, but today... today...<eos> Today, you fight.<eos> You fight like hell!<eos> I love you. I love you, Benjamin Mendoza.<eos> I love you so much.
Today, you fight.<eos> You fight like hell!<eos> I love you. I love you, Benjamin Mendoza.<eos> I love you so much.<eos> I love you more than my life.
I'm sorry, did I cut you off?<eos> No, no.<eos> It's fine.<eos> They're here to take him down.<eos> I'll call you as soon as I know anything.
And I also wanna see if all this stuff we've done has been for nothing.<eos> You wanna know if me getting my ulna snapped by Godzilla helped your little cause?<eos> Alex... I know that you're hurting.<eos> What he did...<eos> I wanted to die... just sitting there, not being able to help you.
Bet you feel better after you push some brown out.<eos> Jeez!<eos> Fuck!<eos> Wrong end!<eos> Come on... let's get you to a bathroom, mama.
Why'd you tell Chapman to go?<eos> Because she didn't want to stay.<eos> Piper always needs to have a cause.<eos> Or some other escape hatch.<eos> Seemed to me like she wanted to help you.
We're talking about 7 doses.<eos> That's a quarter of our supply, Abby, a supply that has to last us for 5 years on an irradiated planet.<eos> We're gonna need every one of those pills, and you know it.<eos> You're right.<eos> We put you in charge of the supplies.
So you're the new Flamekeeper.<eos> This is a sacred space.<eos> Leave before you get hurt.<eos> Give me the Flame.<eos> It does not belong to you or your red-blooded king.
What happened to us deserving a lucky break?<eos> So what are we looking for?<eos> The bunker would have been at the lowest point.<eos> Anything structural.<eos> She's lucky to have you.
You're the one that's going, baby.<eos> Not me. I'm getting off the trolley car right at this corner.<eos> Suppose you stop being fancy.<eos> Let's have it, whatever it is.<eos> All right, I'll tell you.
I thought you agreed that trophies should be earned.<eos> money.<eos> Remember, folks.<eos> Nothing but a genuine Trophyland trophy says to your kids that... ♪ You're the best around ♪<eos> ♪ Nothing's gonna ever keep you down ♪

This is a once-in-a-lifetime face-rubbing-in.<eos> Mm.<eos> Come on, foot.<eos> Kick, damn you!<eos> Son, I found something that belongs to you.
You got to wedge something in there to break the vacuum.<eos> Okay.<eos> Smile, my little watch watcher.<eos> That was a nice thing you did.<eos> Which parenting guide told you to do it?
Anyone who's caught in its blast can no longer move on from this life.<eos> I'm pregnant.<eos> My child's a Hairy. Please!<eos> Well, you've been dealing with this your whole life.<eos> But it's moulded you, shaped you for this role.
- They're animals. - Hey?<eos> - What the hell is wrong with you? - Are you okay?<eos> You sure?<eos> The woman...<eos> She's the one I told you about.
It's alright, boy.<eos> I don't expect anything from you.<eos> Things are as they should be.<eos> I guess we've got nothing to lose if we give it a try, then.<eos> Your friend, Tim Dolan, gave you to me.
What is that?<eos> Well, it amounts to a confession.<eos> No, but why do you have it?<eos> I'm an FBI agent.<eos> And I have you on conspiracy to commit murder.
Enjoy your walk.<eos> It's okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Go on.<eos> Hey, hey! Del, it's amazing, I was literally just about to call you.
Okay, look, Alice...<eos> Evil Thing Inside of Me That Used to Be Alice...<eos> I have to say the words to open the trap. Of my own volition.<eos> Out loud.<eos> And I'm not going to do that because there is one policy for you out here, and it is to box you up for eternity.
I'll be so good.<eos> No, that's crazy.<eos> So I have to be a niffin, yet I don't even get to be a niffin? I could travel the universe.<eos> I could see things you couldn't even imagine, but instead, I have to be bored and stuck with you!<eos> I'm sorry that it is torture to be with the one person who is trying to help you.
That's okay.<eos> My way is best way.<eos> But you can abort it, right?<eos> This is exorcism. That thing is not human.<eos> The longer it's inside you, the more tangled it gets with your essence and the harder it is for me to help you, you understand?
- Jules, stay with us.<eos> Come on.<eos> Julia?<eos> No, don't move around too much.<eos> Sun patched you up, but it's gonna take a while.
We'll both take losses,<eos> Kane and Bellamy among them.<eos> You think you can shake my resolve?<eos> I was willing to sacrifice my own mother to stop A.L.I.E..<eos> And I was willing to sacrifice mine to help you.
I'm done with this.<eos> Move, or I'll kill you, too.<eos> Riley, stand down, ok?<eos> I am begging you.<eos> I know how you feel about them, and I know what they did to you, but your life... your life was saved for a reason, and this isn't it.
No god can sense you. - Thank you.<eos> You're free to go.<eos> Hey, dryad boy!<eos> Come on out.<eos> I saw you in there, sweetheart.
Look, I got what I wanted.<eos> The rest was all a favor to you.<eos> So banish me forever.<eos> Send me home.<eos> - You know, in a sick way, I sort of admire you.
That's the whole point.<eos> You can't break it.<eos> Why don't you do something useful and catch up on all the classes you missed in Fillory? - This isn't working.<eos> - Yeah, tell me about it.<eos> - Keeping you a secret and trying to help you while you do god knows what. I have to ask for help.
Forget about me.<eos> Did you take care of the goods?<eos> I told you to take me to that village.<eos> Look, all of those beautiful women were taken one by one.<eos> Then, they left you with that ugly woman.
How's my ticker?<eos> Deafening.<eos> Well, you don't appear poised to shuffle off this mortal coil.<eos> That makes one of us.<eos> The bad news is, all the memories you lost when you took the cure that turned you from a zombie back to human?
You can't just assume the worst. Yeah, well, the Blaine you knew killed people.<eos> Okay, and behavior like that just doesn't come out of the blue.<eos> A few of those people probably begged for their lives.<eos> Maybe you'll find some good memories in there.<eos> People you loved who loved you back.
Because I look like my piece-of-shit father.<eos> And you wish you'd never had me.<eos> Aaron, that is not true.<eos> Now the outside just matches the inside, right?<eos> I love you more than anything.
And you wish you'd never had me.<eos> Aaron, that is not true.<eos> Now the outside just matches the inside, right?<eos> I love you more than anything.<eos> I have loved you since the day you came into this world.
Please don't leave me here.<eos> I won't.<eos> I promise.<eos> There is nothing more important to me in the world than you.<eos> I love you so much.
I understand you two have written your own?<eos> Megan, would you like to begin?<eos> I once read, "Happiness is only real when shared."<eos> I didn't understand the depth of that statement until I met you, Rob, because you are the perfect man for me.<eos> You love to go where life takes you, and I am so grateful that life brought you to me, because I know that no matter what our future brings, we will have each other.
Oh, that's good.<eos> I'm gonna use that.<eos> In your heart, I see my future.<eos> In your eyes, I see hope.<eos> - In your ears, I whisper, "I love you."
I found... you.<eos> You are my sympathy... my better self... my good angel.<eos> I am bound to you... With a strong attachment.<eos> I think you're... good... gifted... lovely.<eos> A fervent... a solemn passion, conceived in my heart... and it leans to you and draws you to my center.
It's bad luck.<eos> Where's your tux?<eos> Megan, come here.<eos> Listen, baby.<eos> You know I love you more than anything, right?
You are out there every single day, swimming through the worst of the worst, documenting what you tried to do.<eos> You have a problem with that?<eos> You ever hear anything back from that girl who disappeared on you...<eos> Shae?<eos> I mean, the police trying to help you?
Just got the message you're here.<eos> - Hey, I-I really...<eos> - I had to finish a closing.<eos> I-I-I should have called, but I... You know, I wasn't... I don't think the phone's the best way to...<eos> Look, I don't want to put you in a bad position, but I think... I mean, you know, the other night, you could tell that, there's a little... a little tension between me and Clair.
Get some good tippers.<eos> How?<eos> Borrow Tracy's.<eos> Tracy's killing it.<eos> She can break you off some of that.
Yeah, we already talked strategy, so we just need to catch you up.<eos> You've been planning without me?<eos> Yeah... when we were on Earth.<eos> What did you think we were doing?<eos> Eliot, we're not trying to exclude you.
Don't be so hasty.<eos> Are you absolutely sure it didn't work?<eos> If I were your fox god, I might just, say, follow her home rather than kill her on the spot.<eos> You knew this was going to happen.<eos> Why do you think I took you out of there?
Nothing I hear goes any further.<eos> I hear a great deal, I can tell you.<eos> Why, I've never been made to feel so shy in my life!<eos> Don't worry, we won't be discussing anything personal.<eos> Margot, I love you, but I'm worried that you're sleeping with the Home Secretary.
But I do have some news.<eos> It's the reason I came.<eos> I'm going to be marrying Humphrey Maltravers.<eos> Now, I'm sorry, but I've realised he's the one for me.<eos> And my marrying him may help you, too.
- Henry...<eos> I'm so grateful to see you alive.<eos> I've been looking for you.<eos> I spoke with the Appamattuck.<eos> They told me they'd taken you in.
We could man-up that jawline.<eos> Say again?<eos> - Smooth the asymmetry.<eos> Not much we can do about the ear placement.<eos> My ears are adorable and can hear you.
It's okay.<eos> Why can't I remember you?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But you said that Yoki helped you escape the clinic.<eos> So she wants to help you.
- by a shriek.<eos> - Does that mean we're about to get rushed by those screaming stalker things?<eos> No, it was directional.<eos> No one else should've heard.<eos> Then let me take you to The Room That Sings, to find the Remnant.
We needed her help.<eos> You were gone.<eos> I was gonna come back.<eos> - I didn't want you to.<eos> You know, when I first met you, you were Johnny Jaqobis.
You weren't a murderer.<eos> And I won't watch you turn into me.<eos> Who I am... has nothing to do with you.<eos> I am not the angel on your shoulder.<eos> It is not my job to stop you from going full Khlyen and murdering everyone that gets in your way.
They say "Make love, not war."<eos> I say why choose?<eos> Thank you.<eos> For saving my life.<eos> The way that man kissed you, he was never gonna kill you.
Good.<eos> Welcome to Level V.<eos> No more pulling punches.<eos> Tap my heart.<eos> And she saw you?
This is illegal tech.<eos> You are illegal tech.<eos> Why am I unable to move?<eos> Everything from your neural matrix to your physical form is state-of-the-art unsanctioned technology.<eos> I need to know who created you.
Then where will you go?<eos> There are more like us out there.<eos> You could come with us.<eos> My place is here.<eos> You think the human crew of this ship will always accept you for what you really are?
Her neural link is a huge asset.<eos> It allows for total control over the ship, shields, navigation, weapons...<eos> I said no!<eos> Why not?<eos> 'Cause I'm not turning over control of my ship to a damn machine, and sure as hell not one that answers to you.
It's the Galactic Authority.<eos> It's possible they were on patrol in the area and got tipped off by someone on the space station.<eos> You don't actually believe that, do you?<eos> Think about how fast they found us.<eos> What does that tell you?
She recognized the humanity in you, and she tried to reach out to it, but when her superiors found out, she was removed from the project.<eos> But you weighed heavily on her in the ensuing weeks, and try as she might, she found it impossible to move on.<eos> She helped you escape... by burying an override in the Dwarf Star security protocols.<eos> You wandered the city, until you finally tracked her down.<eos> Knowing that her apartment was not safe, she brought you here to this facility, far beyond the reach of Dwarf Star.
And the others, driven by their new programming, eventually sought their freedom, until only we remained.<eos> I realized that the only way to help you move on was to give you just a little bit of her, someone to help you find your way.<eos> To everyone else, a simple level three utility model, but to you, and only you, so much more.<eos> But if you have no memory of this,<eos> - what brought you back?
Milk proteins, modified food starch, cocoa.<eos> No, what do you think?<eos> - Do you like it?<eos> - The disodium phosphate tickles my synthetic receptors.<eos> My awkwardness amuses you.
What for?<eos> The way I treated you when we first came out of stasis, for how I treated your friend, Victor.<eos> You had no contact with Victor.<eos> That's because I was avoiding him.<eos> In all fairness, I think he was avoiding you too.
It's only a matter of time before I uproot them.<eos> And then what?<eos> Have them take my place here in this cell?<eos> Why risk it?<eos> Your years as a fugitive have hardened you, Ryo.
Temperature's already starting to drop.<eos> It's gonna get cold fast.<eos> You should let me take a look at it.<eos> You can see fine from there.<eos> - I mean, let me help you.
If it can tell us anything about what happened or where they went, I want to know.<eos> Understood.<eos> All right, Das, how's it coming with that coil, huh?<eos> You called me Das.<eos> You said you didn't want me to call you Emily.
The key to modern space travel.<eos> What about FTL?<eos> Well, that too.<eos> But it's a little above my pay grade.<eos> You know, uh, there's only so much I can teach you here.
Why not?<eos> Because of the old guy?<eos> His name is Baines.<eos> Okay, look...<eos> I know you think he's your friend 'cause he's teaching you how to fix all this junk, but you can't trust him.
I was trying to get information on your family.<eos> I know what happened.<eos> My parents were killed in an accident.<eos> No, they didn't tell you everything.<eos> They didn't tell you that you have a sister.
So that's a good thing, right?<eos> Heika, we have news from the front.<eos> The enemy has launched a surprise attack...<eos> You killed Nyx.<eos> After I ordered you to use non-lethal force.
It would be great for crew morale.<eos> We could screw up the timeline.<eos> What if the dog that we bring back is instrumental in finding a cure for Sokolsky Syndrome or something?<eos> What?<eos> This is the happiest I've seen you in a long time.
So he's not dead?<eos> No, his mind's still intact, but it's permanently cut off from his body.<eos> Basically, he's a prisoner inside his own head.<eos> That seems almost cruel.<eos> After what he did to you?
Do I look okay?<eos> You're upset.<eos> I understand, but this will all be over soon enough.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> What took you so long?
If it can tell us anything about what happened or where they went, I want to know.<eos> Understood.<eos> All right, Das, how's it coming with that coil, huh?<eos> You called me Das.<eos> You said you didn't want me to call you Emily.

You're, what, 16?<eos> You're hanging with the most infamous mercenaries in the galaxy.<eos> - How'd you manage that?<eos> - I stowed away on their ship.<eos> Okay, but when they found you, why'd they keep you?
My Portia would be beating the crap out of me right now for information.<eos> That was more of an observation than a suggestion.<eos> Who else came over with you on the "Marauder"?<eos> [laughs]<eos> Do I need to remind you that they used you and abandoned you?
Who else came over with you on the "Marauder"?<eos> [laughs]<eos> Do I need to remind you that they used you and abandoned you?<eos> Okay.<eos> They used you and abandoned you.
- What are the chances that there's a corporate ship just hiding out there waiting to track us?<eos> They're small, but I won't risk it.<eos> What about the risk of not warning them?<eos> After the noaccess protocol is lifted, then...<eos> You're not making sense, and I'm beginning to worry that it's the neurotoxin affecting you.
- Shut up and let me work.<eos> Come on.<eos> The Android has disabled the "Marauder."<eos> Look, you need to calm down.<eos> This is the neurotoxin affecting you.
Okay, we're gonna have to take the direct route.<eos> Give us the coordinates.<eos> Where am I?<eos> What were you doing to me?<eos> We rescued you from a very bad situation.
Lara.<eos> You're back.<eos> I never left.<eos> You were the one that went away on assignment.<eos> We haven't seen you in over two months.
It's gonna be chaos in here.<eos> We're out of cream.<eos> You know, when we first remembered our pasts, I thought we were beyond redemption.<eos> But I'm starting to realize it's the rest of the universe that's screwed up.<eos> Took you long enough.
We're out of cream.<eos> You know, when we first remembered our pasts, I thought we were beyond redemption.<eos> But I'm starting to realize it's the rest of the universe that's screwed up.<eos> Took you long enough.<eos> I envy you and your ability to not...
It's my understanding that what people don't know can hurt them... quite severely.<eos> It's just an expression.<eos> You gonna help me or not?<eos> You are not a human being... at least not in the eyes of the law.<eos> You have no rights, which means that I can do whatever is necessary to extract the information that I need from you.
He killed my friend.<eos> What more do I need to know?<eos> I'm not here to debate you on Ryo's moral worth.<eos> Then why'd you come?<eos> I'm taking you to meet someone.
I've always admired your simplicity.<eos> There's no facade.<eos> With you, what you see is what you get.<eos> Top me up, will you?<eos> So I feel I can be brutally honest with you without fear of offending.
As well as who?<eos> Sarah.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Don't make me ask again.<eos> After I downloaded my memories, I took pains to avoid you.
What did you know?<eos> Only what you admitted to me one night in a drunken stupor.<eos> Are you sure you want to know?<eos> Tell me.<eos> She found you, took you in, and saved you.
- I just knew it.<eos> - Really?<eos> - There was never any doubt?<eos> - Nah, of course not.<eos> The Android saw you in one of her future visions.
- We're not leaving!<eos> - Why are you so convinced that this is the place, Mom?<eos> Because it's all we have.<eos> Because there's no place better.<eos> Because we hauled you out of that hell hole and Travis died because of it.
And for that, you need transport. Guns and more men and ammunition to guard that transport.<eos> I can organize that.<eos> Water is the currency now.<eos> How could I ever trust a thief?<eos> I never stole from you.
Hold on!<eos> Hold on, there, buddy!<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> It's me, brother.<eos> Alex, I could kiss you on the mouth right now.
Save your scrip. All are welcome, long as you enjoy a hard floor.<eos> I heard they're shutting off the air handlers one level at a time.<eos> Then what everyone gonna do?<eos> Line up over there, keep out of the way.<eos> Soon as we clear the cargo hold, I'll allow you aboard.
Yeah.<eos> We do.<eos> And Ganymede is their fake war to cover it up.<eos> That lady, she's makin' a fool of you.<eos> She's usin' you to keep us off her ship.
There's still a heat signature where it used to be, but it's all scattered and dissipating.<eos> I think someone blew it up.<eos> You gonna behave like a pack of animals?<eos> That's how I treat you!<eos> You push him again, I send you out the nearest airlock, sa sa ke?
Somnambulist, what's your status?<eos> Status?<eos> You're a son-of-a-bitch!<eos> - That's my status.<eos> - It's good to hear you, too.
It is irreplaceable.<eos> It's not something that you can explain.<eos> You are connected to your motherland with your soul, with your body, with your subconscious.<eos> Motherland is the same as your family.<eos> This earth gave birth to you, fed you.
I'm dragging you all over the country after some guy who isn't even interested in me anymore.<eos> This is my worst idea since I told DeNiro to stick to comedy.<eos> So, what are you saying?<eos> I'm saying this is a mistake.<eos> Let's just go home like you said after that hyena knocked you to the ground and tried to hump you.
All right, bring it in.<eos> Ahh. - You okay?<eos> - No.<eos> My relationship is really over, and I'm starting to lose feeling in my downstairs.<eos> Yeah. Ugh. I'm sorry I dragged you across the country.
Previously on Billions...<eos> Danny fucking Margolis.<eos> What brings you back?
Just the two of us.<eos> We'll celebrate our way.<eos> No. Big occasions like this need to be marked, acknowledged, for posterity and for fun.<eos> You deserve to be celebrated.<eos> And you should be surrounded by your whole gang so they can honor you, too.
I put myself into it, and now...<eos> It's not what you remembered, not what you fell in love with.<eos> I think I went back to see if I still could.<eos> Something I tell my patients when they're hesitating about making some kind of move in their own life is, sometimes you have to jump in... all the way in to find out.<eos> They are lucky to have you.
I'll invest silently.<eos> Your role will be hidden.<eos> We'll replace the funds as soon as we sell some of the stock.<eos> No one's the wiser.<eos> Well, if this is what it takes... to help you and Ira...
As always.<eos> You know, we never really had you over to the house enough.<eos> Thanks for the invite.<eos> And I appreciate the personal follow-up.<eos> Chuck was, um... quite surprised to hear from you.
I forgot that I don't give a fuck about any of this.<eos> It's all sailcloth held up with poles lit by lighting designers and ripped to the ground tomorrow.<eos> I wanna be with you.<eos> I wanna take you somewhere that matters.<eos> Everyone's waiting for you.
That's the only one night stand you're ever gonna get.<eos> Must be a different kind of room service than they have at Tuggington's Hourly Motel.<eos> Where the first tug is free.<eos> R2, thank God.<eos> I thought I lost you when we blew up the Death Star.
I'm still pissed at them for stealing my life story for "Pretty Woman."<eos> Jason Alexander's character was totally me.<eos> For our date, he's thinking of taking me on an afternoon picnic in the park.<eos> The pretty one, where you crotch punched that mime into a pond.<eos> You know the fact that Bobby's taking you on a day date is a bad sign, right?
But I like bananas.<eos> Not the fruit.<eos> The texture grosses me out.<eos> But you.<eos> I could kiss you for that.
So tell me about this guy, Randy.<eos> Uh, there's nothing to say.<eos> It's not about him.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Did he bring you down low?
Real low.<eos> Shake you up?<eos> All shook up.<eos> Hey, get your ass out of my face, razor hips.<eos> Did he spin you around and slide right out of your life?
She's not the boss of me.<eos> - Bobby!<eos> - Coming, Ma!<eos> Caroline, relax.<eos> Nobody likes you right away.
Did he give you a magnifying glass for that?<eos> Max, Gary says you use your toxic, mean-spirited jokes to keep people like me at a distance.<eos> You know what else works?<eos> Putting my hand on your forehead.<eos> Max, Gary also says you have a fear of intimacy stemming from your father abandoning you.
Well, if you were part of the family you'd be addicted to Diet Pepsi and get into mall fights on Black Friday.<eos> Then I might be a cousin.<eos> Oh, you know what?<eos> I'll walk you out.<eos> If Homeless Larry tries to grab you, - I can fend him off. - Yeah.
- Oh, come on!<eos> Tejada holds up at third.<eos> - Phillies suck even on paper.<eos> - Well, it's a good thing some things stay the same after the apocalypse.<eos> - So what brings you back so soon?
Two days later he's back.<eos> Ain't no use...<eos> Where the hell's Marshawn? !<eos> Tell him to get his ass in here!<eos> I told you already, he's on his way.
You guys are my partners.<eos> We're gonna change the world.<eos> No, first you make me dinner, then we get comfortable.<eos> Yeah, I'll be over in a second.<eos> Okay. Love you, too.
What kind of criminal works at a medical clinic?<eos> Well, I'm just guessing here, but, you know, probably the kind that steals drugs.<eos> Did you graduate from the academy or am I just being punk'd?<eos> Well, actually, at the academy, they told us to explore every theory.<eos> Well, I'm gonna give you a little lesson that you-you didn't pick up there.
You're just that innocent kind of guy who walks away from the police, right?<eos> Just check the bag, will you?<eos> What's your name, man?<eos> Reggie Walker. Your real name, buddy.<eos> We found you in our database.
Also, he likes my cooking.<eos> That makes us friends.<eos> Well?<eos> Gideon has his own battles to fight.<eos> Then he's lucky to have you by his side.
Hold on.<eos> Honey, you should go with her.<eos> No.<eos> I just got here.<eos> I want to be here with you and help.
Oh, she's flawless.<eos> She's the perfect me.<eos> Tess, It's me!<eos> You, Caroline!<eos> Oh, and the young lady playing you hasn't shown up yet.
Looking at them, being us.<eos> Andy, I can't talk now.<eos> I have to promote my dessert bar and answer all these questions.<eos> You know how reporters get when they have a fascinating subject.<eos> Caroline, no one's asked you anything and they already told you to stop raising your hand.
Max, the actress playing you isn't here.<eos> It's been reported she's been on a downward spiral ever since she got into the role.<eos> Her behavior is disgusting, and I very much approve.<eos> This is for Michelle, the young lady playing the Han character.<eos> What drove you to the role?
But you don't need to be.<eos> - Andy, I have a boyfriend.<eos> - Mm. A violently jealous boyfriend.<eos> I wouldn't say violently.<eos> I choked you out for a Pop-Tart this morning.
Max George Black...<eos> I love you.<eos> Will you marry me?<eos> Wait, what?<eos> Caroline can really put you to sleep on and off the screen, huh?
Wiping away the blood won't change what you've done.<eos> What kind of man kills his own son?<eos> Look at you.<eos> Holed up here like a rat pretending to play house with another man's woman and child.<eos> The child of the man who ran you through.
Oh, there he is, huh?<eos> The mighty Quinn.<eos> You know, I used to think you were so strong.<eos> But you're weak.<eos> No wonder all the women in your life betrayed you.
Changed how?<eos> After you saved my life, you forced me to see that despite the things you've done, you're not the man you were.<eos> Don't ruin what we have by doing something you'll regret.<eos> She's lying to you.<eos> She'll say anything to keep you from the truth.
Good morning.<eos> I don't know about you but I slept like a baby last night.<eos> Just, uh, between us, I... I kind of... I kind of blew Ravel's mind last night.<eos> You know what I'm saying?<eos> Sorry if we kept you awake.
- Thanks, Edgar.<eos> I won't be long.<eos> It's gonna be hard at first, but I know we're gonna be fine.<eos> Wait.<eos> I saw you at the reception, but I don't remember training you.
Who else would I be?<eos> You always said that if we had a boy, we'd name him Henry. After your...<eos> My father, yes.<eos> Maybe you're still delirious.<eos> Is there anything I can get you?
You don't know the first thing about me, son.<eos> So now you're angry?<eos> Yeah, maybe I am.<eos> You know what?<eos> Maybe I'll stick you in the ground next to him.
I can't lose him.<eos> And I, I can't save him either.<eos> Not without your help.<eos> The mirror chamber.<eos> Did the Master tell you not to trust everything you see in there?
She's lying to you!<eos> Ask her about Tate.<eos> Go on, ask her.<eos> There's so much you do not know, child.<eos> It's a pity you rejected the chance for me to teach you.
Yeah, yeah. Look, so what's going on?<eos> Look, man.<eos> I need you to help get me into that building where you work.<eos> You know, when no one's around.<eos> Look, I can't help you - steal from the... - Hey, hey, hey.
Hello, this is Nurse Greenwood.<eos> I'd like an update on that file<eos> - that I gave you yesterday.<eos> - She always changes her mind.<eos> You know, after you were born we were trying to decide on a name to call you, and she wanted to call you Herb.
You're bringing in the jizz fridge and, when it's empty, you're going to carry me back out in it.<eos> Okay, listen.<eos> I know I said I would do it, and I want to do it.<eos> I mean, I want to help you...<eos> Look, they haven't stopped you once on your way out, no matter what you've been carrying.
I'm starting to root for Bob, he sounds like a winner.<eos> I got no reaction out of Adam!<eos> I mean, I did everything short of telling him that Bob and I were slow dancing in the cafeteria.<eos> Well, maybe you just have to accept the fact that things are different now.<eos> Marcy, I did not call you to get a levelheaded and fair assessment of the situation.
Yes. He found out I was making inquiries.<eos> He was very upset.<eos> He asked what I was doing.<eos> I told him he needed to talk to you.<eos> Okay, I'm sorry I put you in this position, but I'll handle it from here.
I mean, they still have more witnesses to call.<eos> So, you think it's gonna be a 9-3 against.<eos> Yeah, all right.<eos> I mean, I could be wrong.<eos> I'll call you if I hear anything.
No, I promise.<eos> I just got a lot on my mind.<eos> Come on, let's get ready.<eos> Tom, I'm worried about you.<eos> I can see it in your face... The toll this job is taking on you.
So many things I still want to tell you.<eos> But you can't.<eos> I was thinking, a year ago... the only thing I ever had to worry about on a weekday was whether or not I'd get to Penny's soccer practice on time.<eos> That is a lifetime ago.<eos> Tom, how can I help you?
You need to make a choice.<eos> The girl in your mind or the girl standing in front of you.<eos> - What do you want?<eos> - I want to be with my mother.<eos> Shh. He can hear you.
- Medical.<eos> - We are a go.<eos> Comm check.<eos> One, two, one, two.<eos> I hear you, Cameron.
We are all our parents.<eos> That's who we become.<eos> Blair and Nathan are fighting.<eos> It's about a girl.<eos> You think that she's using me to get to you?
Cameron.<eos> You okay there?<eos> Kirsten, bounce.<eos> And hey, I don't think you're a bad person for calling the NSA on me.<eos> Kirsten, Daddy loves you so much.
Reade's back.<eos> Yeah? How's he doing?<eos> I think the time off did him some good.<eos> I'm not taking time off.<eos> Shepherd tortured you, your boyfriend shot you, then tried to lethal injection you.
- Agreed. - Okay.<eos> I think someone's checking you out.<eos> You ain't lying.<eos> Come on, you shutting it down already?<eos> Yeah, guess I'm not used to having you around, it's like twice the work.
Things change.<eos> And if we can't adapt, we die.<eos> I did my research.<eos> What was wrong with the old design?<eos> I like you, Parker.
You need to be careful.<eos> We will.<eos> No, you need to be careful.<eos> I know you want Roman to be something different, but you have to treat him like any dangerous asset.<eos> Same way that I treated you when I found out who you were.
That I, Gordon Meredith Enver, should be in your shoes, breathing your rarefied air as a beloved visionary instead of... lurking, nameless and thankless in the shadows, like some digital thug!<eos> Give us a moment.<eos> Gord... I'm so sorry... that you feel that way.<eos> But I didn't steal anything from you.<eos> Yeah, we developed some of that code together, but then I begged you to move to Silicon Valley with me to finish it.
- he's gonna kill you.<eos> - Shut up!<eos> You are trespassing on US Government property!<eos> I'm not playing around, kid.<eos> No, you keep screwing around, that guy's gonna jack you up.
Not yet.<eos> Maybe he got delayed at his first stop.<eos> So, where are you from?<eos> Before all this happened, I was living in New York.<eos> What brought you here?
Don't test me.<eos> Look, I get it. You don't like people, and most of them don't wanna share a beer with you.<eos> But what you're doing right now is stupid.<eos> All right? And you're only doing it because you're rattled.<eos> You almost died in that silo but I got you out.
- Get 'em!<eos> Run him over!<eos> That guy you just ran over?<eos> He's on the trailer now!<eos> Resist the temptation to read anything into the fact that I saved you.
Sloane...<eos> Hey, Tobe.<eos> They said it went perfectly and that you're gonna be awake soon.<eos> So...<eos> I love you, too.
I'd marry the hell out of you, Kate Pearson.<eos> You would?<eos> Wait, just like that?<eos> Just like that.<eos> It was just like that from the moment I met you, kid.
Totally her fault.<eos> I got out of my car to go scream at her... but I saw her face.<eos> And I walked right up to her and stuck out my hand like an idiot and said, "Hi, I'm Joe.<eos> Don't worry about what just happened.<eos> Could I take you out for a cup of coffee?"
- Huh. But... you are carrying my children, so I'm gonna leave you to your afternoon.<eos> Thank you, sweetheart.<eos> Hey, baby?<eos> Yes, babe.<eos> I love you so much.
Life has enough twists.<eos> Alli liked Ordinary People, the new one with Mary Tyler Moore. Oh.<eos> Your mom liked her.<eos> Well, you should check it out.<eos> Maybe see if a friend wants to join you for a flick.
Really? TOBY:<eos> I'd marry the hell out of you, Kate Pearson.<eos> Just like that?<eos> Just like that?<eos> It was "just like that" from the moment I met you, kid.
Maybe.<eos> So, why now, Kevin? Why did you come find me?<eos> Because I never stopped thinking about you.<eos> So, tell me, you know, everything. Start from the beginning.<eos> I want to know everything that happened to you since the last time I saw you.
Yes.<eos> Come on, champion.<eos> Hi.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Well, I took the kids to their friends' for a sleepover and I'm taking you somewhere. Where?
Okay.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I wonder if they still hold up. Hmm.<eos> saying I do means saying I will.<eos> I will love you today and every day for the rest of my life. BETH:
I love that.<eos> Okay.<eos> Put it in.<eos> I've been trying to focus on all of the little moments that... that I don't want to forget.<eos> But the moment that's burned into my brain and heart... * Mm-hmm ...is the first time I saw you.
You always have to go big, don't you, Pearson?<eos> For you, Sophie... always.<eos> Kev.<eos> Hey.<eos> Sophie is Kate's best friend and she's spending the whole party with you.
- Yeah? It's not my fault.<eos> I know.<eos> He got so mad at me. It's okay, jenna.<eos> William?<eos> What the hell's the matter with you?
Have fun, Mom. Seriously.<eos> I will.<eos> I love you, Mom.<eos> I love you more.<eos> I love you most. Be good to each other.
- how I taught him how to drive a car. - teach me how to drive.<eos> - Whoa, wait, wait.<eos> - And Dad was like... Really?<eos> Randall?<eos> Did he tell you about the time that I taught him how to drive? No, no, you've got to tell me this, Jack.
It's because I thought the play was the only thing that mattered. You know?<eos> I looked out at that crowd tonight, I saw that empty seat.<eos> It made me sad, I'm not gonna lie to you.<eos> But then I saw the other seats.<eos> You know, I saw my family and... I saw you all the way back there and I realized I didn't come to New York to be in a hit play.

Oh, it's pretty damn far, isn't it?<eos> You be safe.<eos> You be good.<eos> If you want me to come, I will.<eos> I've kept you to myself long enough.
Is it okay to call it a breakdown?<eos> Lots of names for it.<eos> Anxiety attack, mental distress, nervous exhaustion, stress-induced trauma.<eos> You choose.<eos> It was quite a shock to see you so vulnerable. The night Kevin brought you home...
You hear me, cuz?<eos> All right, come here, you.<eos> Let's do it.<eos> I love you, cuz.<eos> I love you, too.
For years, I waited to hear from you.<eos> We was gonna do something, man.<eos> I'm sorry, I know you guys are catching up with each other... but that makes you my what, like, second cousin?<eos> Or is it cousin once remo...<eos> The hell happened to you, cuz?

Well, actually they probably will, but I won't.<eos> So here's what I was thinking. We can...<eos> Hey, William.<eos> Hey.<eos> It's okay. I'm gonna get you to the hospital, okay?
No, you took her at the hospital.<eos> You were there.<eos> No, David.<eos> It's clear now what happened.<eos> They came for you but got her by accident, and we've got you, but we want her too.
No!<eos> Who's the guy?<eos> I don't know, but I've seen this man before.<eos> He was following me.<eos> Who are you? I'm someone who's waited a long time to meet you.

I had to wait until my third.<eos> I test well.<eos> Ok, you don't have to be modest.<eos> Do you know what I had to do to pry you away from the B.A.P.?<eos> We're lucky to have you.
It's the law!<eos> I get my mom when I'm in labor!<eos> To hold my hand and crap!<eos> Right?<eos> Yes, that is the rule, but I... I thought Dr. Eldredge explained this to you.
You think a crying baby isn't gonna bother her?<eos> - Who a you?<eos> - What?<eos> I mean, how did I not know that you felt this way?<eos> I mean, what did prison ever do to you?
What?<eos> You're trying to act like we're the same, you and me, but we're not.<eos> I also used to live in my car.<eos> Which was stolen.<eos> I get how life can screw you over sometimes.
You're lying to me.<eos> Is she lying to me?<eos> No, Kristen. your baby's totally fine.<eos> Rochester, calm down.<eos> They're trying to help you.
The key to what?<eos> Winning the war.<eos> And other things.<eos> Dr. Vacon's Advanced Time Travel class has been canceled.<eos> She called you a "memory artist"?
I was worried.<eos> What was it... in the memory?<eos> Melanie won't tell me.<eos> It was just kid stuff.<eos> It's okay, though, that I brought you here?
And what did the stars say?<eos> No, that's...<eos> I'm not... I'm not... I'm not supposed to talk about it.<eos> This is a safe place, David.<eos> Nothing can hurt you here.
There is something wrong with me, I know, but I cannot just leave her.<eos> Stay!<eos> Do the work.<eos> Not long, just... enough to learn what you can do, what we can do, together.<eos> Then we can rescue her like we rescued you.
Henry.<eos> I want the princes busy at their favorite pursuits today.<eos> They can do what they want but they must be kept occupied.<eos> Your Grace.<eos> I looked for you, earlier.
Nothing.<eos> I told you we need to replace this operating system.<eos> No.<eos> He's trying to reach us.<eos> We can hear you, my love.

You know, you let your guard down, man.<eos> They gave you a shot, and now we're here.<eos> No, he said it wasn't the drugs.<eos> Who, Captain Nemo in his giant ice cube?<eos> Come on, man, they doped you up and kicked you out of your own body to do who knows what.
You know, like I have more energy, I feel more positive.<eos> David, I'm not psychotic.<eos> No, I never said... baby, please.<eos> You are so much better than when you first...<eos> I mean, they had you in straps.
You know I'm right.<eos> Your whole life you've felt it.<eos> You're a freak.<eos> You're disgusting.<eos> We adopt you because we have to, but deep down, it's all we can do to keep from puking whenever you're around.
David...<eos> I knew your father, did you know that?<eos> - My...<eos> - Your real father.<eos> The guy that gave you away?
I found you.<eos> Such a sweet little baby and me, your very own walking, talking fungus.<eos> What do you he'll say...<eos> When he finds out?<eos> I'm trying to help you, kid.
That'll... a cocktail!<eos> Shit, we could give God a run for his money, right?<eos> But then all this love bullshit.<eos> I'm beginning to think I have to go it alone.<eos> Do you know what happens to you in the scenario?
Now it's ready to override the original program.<eos> Meaning me.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Meaning you.<eos> If we don't get Amahl Farouk out of your head today, he will erase you.
- I'm...<eos> I think you ruptured my spleen.<eos> - Hey. Did we win?<eos> Does it look like we won?<eos> You should not have done that, as much as I like kissing you.
- Uh, not really.<eos> I think we should get this thing out of me fast.<eos> I don't think it's too happy.<eos> Come on, David.<eos> Need to get you across to my lab.
The facility's not that far.<eos> What the hell did they want with us anyway?<eos> Why'd they keep us locked up for so long?<eos> It doesn't matter now.<eos> What the hell happened to you in there?
You don't get to say that to me!<eos> Stop!<eos> Ramse, stop!<eos> God damn it. Why couldn't you just trust me?<eos> I always trusted you.
I got it.<eos> I got it.<eos> Ah, yeah. Let's bring this puppy home.<eos> You brought us here!<eos> They were waiting for you.
Said by the woman who had her own sister use her name for six months.<eos> Has he told you any more about who he killed?<eos> No, but he said it's for my own good.<eos> That's a good sign.<eos> He wants to protect you from it.
Well, you saw my ranking.<eos> I failed.<eos> Is there anything else you want to talk to me about?<eos> Is there something you want me to talk to you about?<eos> So, the AIC hasn't contacted you yet?
Well, then, it worked.<eos> Little radiation tracer he ingested is a little tradecraft secret, courtesy of MI6.<eos> That's what was in it?<eos> You... You poisoned him?<eos> I already told you, it's not gonna hurt him.
No lingering zombie signs, that's good.<eos> Liv, hear that?<eos> The cure worked.<eos> I'm human again!<eos> But it also turned you into a baby?
'Cause it's bad?<eos> It's bad.<eos> You don't want to tell me 'cause it's bad.<eos> Oh, God. I'm a terrible person.<eos> Everything I put you through.
Oh, God. I'm a terrible person.<eos> Everything I put you through.<eos> Liv.<eos> Spoiler alert.<eos> That letter, it says that Good Old Major loved you like no one else ever.
Oh, speaking of which, how're those eggs coming, maestro?<eos> It's getting there.<eos> Sage... Where's the sage?<eos> Sage?<eos> That woman slapped you because you slept with her husband?
- Me?<eos> - He means me.<eos> Oh, great.<eos> More needles.<eos> I could knock you out, if it'll help.
- What are you doing, kid?<eos> - Stop. You think you're safe here?<eos> With these clowns?<eos> They're helping me.<eos> Oh, like the hospital helped you?
David, this is very important.<eos> You are not to go back there.<eos> I know, I know, I know, but maybe, maybe, if I can take Syd there, maybe I can bring Amy back.<eos> No. You surprised them.<eos> Next time, they'll be waiting for you, and one of two things will happen.
Have any idea what it feels like to be in pain every day?<eos> When I was spacewalking, everything was right.<eos> I just want that again.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry for doing this to you, raven.
Skaikru dishonors us all yet again.<eos> When the people find out, you'll pay for this in blood.<eos> Skaikru wasn't the only clan that showed dishonor at the Conclave.<eos> Was it?<eos> I know you were disguised as a warrior on the battlefield, and I know Roan caught you.

Abby... When that door closes today, I need to be on the other side.<eos> Please.<eos> I just got you back.<eos> Don't say that.<eos> I love you, Marcus, but I made my decision.
She stays.<eos> She stays.<eos> Forgive me.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> We're not leaving you behind.
Thanks for ruining my metaphor, O.<eos> I love you, big brother.<eos> Guess it takes the end of the world for me to say it.<eos> - Bell?<eos> - I love you, too.
Indra, I'm not a Commander.<eos> The time of the Commanders is past.<eos> The time of the Flame is past.<eos> This is your time.<eos> Let me help you.
Oh, so you can talk.<eos> I wondered.<eos> It's right through these trees, sunshine.<eos> What's your problem with me, anyway?<eos> What did I ever do to you?
I wondered.<eos> It's right through these trees, sunshine.<eos> What's your problem with me, anyway?<eos> What did I ever do to you?<eos> You mean, besides trying to kill my best friend after he got hit with a spear because he was keeping you awake?
Not dead?<eos> He's definitely not in jail.<eos> I don't know.<eos> With Reddington, I don't assume anything.<eos> He kept you from getting answers about who your father is.
I'll find them.<eos> I...<eos> I have security camera footage from the attack.<eos> I convinced the police there wasn't any.<eos> Look, I know they sent you to warn me.

It's up to you, Robert.<eos> Would you prefer to be in the White House or the doghouse?<eos> Robert?<eos> You put our country at risk to get me back.<eos> I don't know whether to hit you or hug you.
I mean...<eos> I do.<eos> Obviously, I do, but...<eos> I don't.<eos> You know how I told you that deposition was terrifying?
And I was just like, "Get off me."<eos> Just get off me."<eos> And I closed the laptop, set it down on the nightstand, and I just got up, and I started pacing.<eos> As this fucking rage was coming up in me, my wife's, like, freaking out.<eos> She's like, "What's wrong? What is wrong with you?"
If it understands the concept of death, it understands its own captivity. Okay?<eos> So it never dawned on that lady, that whole time she's shootin' the shit with him, it never dawned on her to sign to the thing, like, "Hey."<eos> Like, "Do you want to get the fuck out of here?"<eos> "Do you hate it in here?<eos> Do you want to fucking kill us... for sticking you in here, away from your friends in the jungle?"
I don't know where you are or what you're doing, but call me!<eos> Damn it!<eos> Oh, my...<eos> Where have you been?<eos> I have been looking everywhere for you.
- Night-night, baby.<eos> - Sleep well.<eos> Be good for Grandma, okay?<eos> Love you.<eos> Love you, nugget.
Who are you?<eos> I'm your sister, and I'm gonna explain everything, okay?<eos> I just need you to relax.<eos> Where are you taking me?<eos> I'm taking you somewhere safe.
Please, I don't want to hurt you.<eos> If you can just come back to the car...<eos> Please.<eos> Please, stop.<eos> I am trying to help you.
Jane, you can't tell your brother that you ZIP-ed him.<eos> How can he trust me if I lie to him?<eos> Well, how can he trust you if you don't?<eos> Think about it, Jane.<eos> When you came out of that bag, how'd you feel about the people that put you in there?
What does the FBI know about Phase Two?<eos> !<eos> Everything.<eos> I know what you're doing.<eos> I'm answering you.
I know what you know.<eos> Less, actually.<eos> I didn't even know she was here today.<eos> You're the Chief's husband, and you don't know anything?<eos> - No. - What does that get you?
Okay, Bryan, we need to get started.<eos> Oh, no, wait, wait...<eos> Mindy, you're gonna feel a little drowsy...<eos> Mindy, I'm so sorry.<eos> I love you... so much.
I was in Path.<eos> I was getting a culture.<eos> Come on.<eos> You've been in your head all day.<eos> It's fine, 'cause I covered for you, but... talk to someone.
I did.<eos> Are you in hiding?<eos> Are you evading the law?<eos> Are you on the lam?<eos> ! Alex. I can help you, but, I mean, I have kids here.
Uh, Riggs, we can ask after he's done talking to your mom.<eos> Whenever he's done doing what?<eos> - Talking to your mother.<eos> - My what?<eos> Your mom, your mother, uh, the one that raised and fed you?
Hey. I have a few minutes before my lap chole.<eos> Oh, I gave that to Lawson.<eos> What?<eos> Why?<eos> When Dr. Minnick approaches you to observe in your OR and teach, she's not asking you for permission.
- You never gave me a chance to say... - Don't, okay?<eos> - Don't thank me.<eos> - I'm not.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry I hurt you. I'm sorry...
Not your job.<eos> No, it was so hard to keep from smiling, especially when I said, "You're gonna need surgery."<eos> Ahh!<eos> I'm just happy that you're here.<eos> I'm trying not to hug you right now.
You care about the students maybe even more than I do.<eos> And you have this brilliant way of making your victories their victories, and you're good for this place, and you're good for them,<eos> - and they should know that. - Arizona, stop.<eos> - I just think it's not...<eos> - I need you to stop... so I can kiss you.
Okay, nothing to be discussed.<eos> Right.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Well, you know now.<eos> So I guess I can use you.
Have you asked yourself that?<eos> - What?<eos> Why do I want a baby?<eos> - Yes, yes.<eos> What do you need that you don't have that you think a baby is going to bring you?
I don't have a good reason.<eos> I tried to come up with one.<eos> So then I thought, "Well, why do I like her?"<eos> And I don't know.<eos> From the first time I saw you, you were at the O.R. board.
And it has to be somebody who's worthy.<eos> Find a decent man who loves you just a little more than you love him.<eos> How about equally as much?<eos> How about that?<eos> No, he needs to think he is lucky to have you and not the other way around.
Man.<eos> Hey, neighbor!<eos> - That's my neighbor.<eos> - What is this?<eos> I never told you about the time I was failing all my college courses and my parents cut me off, so I went to the 7-11 and I bought a lottery ticket and won a couple hundred G's?
- That's part of it, yeah.<eos> - I bet that plays great down here.<eos> A town of seekers.<eos> I'm sure that's what attracted you.<eos> I wonder, uh... I wonder what attracted you.
Thank you, Maia.<eos> For what?<eos> Not judging us, not judging me.<eos> Do you love Dad?<eos> We had troubles and, um... we never wanted to bother you with them, but, um...
So you're a hero.<eos> I saw it.<eos> The video.<eos> Okay. It's... let's not.<eos> What? I was talking to you like you were eight years old and you're...
- Diane, please.<eos> I don't like it when people... make a big deal.<eos> I represent unscrupulous people, and you... you save children.<eos> You...<eos> I was calling you to ask you to dinner.
Everyone's at least ten years younger than you.<eos> As gross as it sounds, she's warm for your form.<eos> Walter, cut the crap.<eos> You're still in love with Paige.<eos> I never liked you because you never made me feel welcome.
I know you care about me.<eos> It's much more than that.<eos> I love you, Cabe.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too, son.
You're welcome, by the way.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Oh, well, today we got kidnapped, locked in a room with toxic chemicals, shot at.<eos> But you handled yourself like a champ.<eos> I mean, yes. I threw you in the deep end when you were a child, but you learned how to swim on your own.
Five figures worth of rare motorcycle parts.<eos> I have a problem.<eos> We're both broke?<eos> Mm. That's great.<eos> 'Cause the truth is, I would marry you in Kovelsky's parking lot.
Why don't you go wash up for dinner and I'll be right there.<eos> You took him to the library after all that happened today?<eos> He doesn't need the burden of knowing everything that goes wrong here.<eos> You made me strong enough for the both of us, remember?<eos> I know you're being sarcastic, but... I threw you in the water out past the breakers, and you swam in safe.
Of biblical proportions.<eos> You okay?<eos> I couldn't sleep last night.<eos> That's what happens when you realize that the men who want you dead know you're back in town.<eos> Not to mention they saw you with Scorpion.
This is it.<eos> One last time.<eos> I promise.<eos> I get my money, and I can disappear forever.<eos> I never liked helping you with one of your schemes, not when I was nine and certainly not now, but I... don't want my friends in danger, and I really don't want Ralph in danger,
Just... get your coat.<eos> Oh, hey.<eos> You don't need me for a simple engineering job, so I'm gonna help my mom out with something.<eos> Well, we're dealing with civilians.<eos> It's always good to have you there as a buffer.
This is great.<eos> Walt's a mess and the cops and reporters are here.<eos> I hate to say it, but we really need the waitress.<eos> The look on that guy's face when you threatened to write him up was priceless.<eos> Almost as priceless as your face when I yelled at you.
- Thank you.<eos> Let me get that.<eos> - Appreciate it. - Yeah, yeah.<eos> It's about the Toby Kendall case.<eos> They're coming after me for telling you about the camera evidence.
Does that even work?<eos> We will find out if it works.<eos> My guess is they call you next.<eos> Damn it!<eos> Yikes, who pissed you off?
Good.<eos> She died and went to Hell for you, Luci.<eos> For you.<eos> She faced her greatest fears all because she loves you.<eos> - Oh, come on. - Yes, she hurt you.
Here you go.<eos> How cute this guy is.<eos> So...<eos> I went back to that school today.<eos> And I think they'd let you in if you wanted to go.
Or on top, dealer's choice.<eos> I'm kidding.<eos> Okay, I'll set it all up.<eos> You won't have to lift a finger.<eos> Let me help you.
I plan on kicking Mum into Heaven and slamming the gates on her backside.<eos> - Maybe there's another piece missing.<eos> - If you find the killer, then you'll find our piece of the Flaming Sword.<eos> I went through a lot this last year, and improv sort of helped me reorient myself.<eos> Amenadiel told you about our trip back to Heaven, didn't he?
- I know.<eos> And she doesn't care who she hurts anymore.<eos> Linda.<eos> I'll go check on Linda.<eos> You go after Mom, she'll listen to you.
Why haven't you taken these premonitions to the police?<eos> I have.<eos> They looked at me like I'm crazy.<eos> That's why I came to you, Agent Keen.<eos> I saw you at the grocery store, recognized you from the news.
He wasn't ready.<eos> Now he has two with someone else.<eos> Look, I'm not trying to make excuses, but I could tell that your parents didn't like me.<eos> I always wondered, was it an ethnic thing?<eos> Oh, yeah, 'cause you're so Third World, and my dynastic fox-hunting family would've never accepted you as anything but the maid?
The point is, is that we knew this wasn't gonna be easy.<eos> Right.<eos> I'm sorry for making you feel like the odd man out.<eos> Me, too.<eos> And I'm sorry for keeping the "girl-girl-girl" thing from you.
Hey, everyone.<eos> I'm Sergeant Wells.<eos> Jake, Amy, nice to see you.<eos> - Teddy, nice to see you, too.<eos> Excited to have you in the field with us.
- And also, yes, we are different people, but I love that about us.<eos> I love that Jake's a little messy and that he cares so much about his dumb sneakers and he doesn't get stressed out about calendars.<eos> - Or flossing my teeth.<eos> - No, the non-flossing is crazy.<eos> - Copy that, and I love you.
Max has regained consciousness.<eos> Yep. For now.<eos> I'm going to recline you back.<eos> Everything I said, the stuff we were fighting about earlier, I take it back, all of it.<eos> I-I thought I'd lost you, Max.
What if she hates me?<eos> She's not gonna hate you.<eos> And I called it off, and I kept it off until I couldn't anymore, and I'm really very, very sorry.<eos> That's the one.<eos> I have been looking everywhere for you.
We're doing an E.O.M.<eos> Did you get a chance to look over the chart?<eos> Yeah, I'm caught up.<eos> Great.<eos> Oh, Grey's calling you.
I know, I know! And I tried many times, but everything I threw at him, he just shot down.<eos> It's way worse than we thought.<eos> I mean, it's like he's dead inside.<eos> How'd it go with Catherine?<eos> Mm. She told you to mind your own business?
I want to go out with you.<eos> Meredith.<eos> Stop.<eos> No. I won't.<eos> I am very sorry that I screwed up and I hurt you.
Can you help me, Dr. Karev?<eos> Can you fix my eyes?<eos> All right, take a deep breath.<eos> Can you do that?<eos> I promise, Liam, I'm gonna do everything I can to help you.
I-I came to apologize.<eos> I-I might have put pressure on you to be someone you're not.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I-I think it's taking me a little longer to get used to this world than I imagined.<eos> Well, let me help you. I...
It's just that there's this pesky little protection spell surrounding the town.<eos> I came here for a fresh start... new people to rob, places to drink, women to meet.<eos> But, you see, I'm not gonna get any of that, not with your sister threatening to reform me at every step.<eos> Believe me, that I understand.<eos> But why should I help you?
Well, isn't it time to make a few friends?<eos> When do we leave?<eos> You think tea with dear old Dad is gonna make everything better?<eos> But a chat might.<eos> I want to know what the Black Fairy did to you to make you think killing the Savior is the only way to become a hero.
You said you came here because you wanted to find meaning in your life.<eos> Was any of that true?<eos> I truly wanted to find a purpose here, but you made it so hard.<eos> How did I make it hard?<eos> All I did was try to help you.
Bae, please...<eos> Do it!<eos> Kill him!<eos> You were my Fairy Godmother.<eos> I have been looking for you everywhere.
I watched one son darken his heart long ago.<eos> I can't watch another do the same.<eos> You can't stop me.<eos> I command you.<eos> I'm not here to stop you.
Bae... what are you going to do with the dagger now?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But the baker's son will think twice about pushing me in the mud when he sees me carrying this.<eos> Oh, Bae, listen to yourself.<eos> Papa, I'm sorry I asked you to give up your power.
Perhaps the day shall be ours.<eos> I know I shouldn't have told them anything.<eos> It was too much.<eos> And I couldn't bear it.<eos> What did he do to you?
Even that marvel pales in comparison.<eos> The flame of the eternals.<eos> Legend posits that this is an offshoot of the forge used by Hephaestus, the blacksmith of the gods, to hammer out his mythic weapons.<eos> There she is.<eos> Promethean flame, by the hand of your master vulcan, I call you forth.
The flame of the eternals.<eos> Legend posits that this is an offshoot of the forge used by Hephaestus, the blacksmith of the gods, to hammer out his mythic weapons.<eos> There she is.<eos> Promethean flame, by the hand of your master vulcan, I call you forth.<eos> Weapon of war, return to the conflagration that shaped you.
Will this war between us never end, Henry?<eos> It ends... today.<eos> You tried to usurp me as the Horseman of War.<eos> Now that I have what is rightfully mine, I will be free of you.<eos> I brought you into this world, Henry.
Their solo work never had that same magic.<eos> Are we good?<eos> I brought you a cruller yesterday.<eos> If you don't understand what a fish-cake emoticon means...<eos> Did I do or say something to offend you?
And what's gonna happen when you see her?<eos> Oh, good question.<eos> I mean, a handshake seems super cold considering we are gonna be married one day and... probably move to Connecticut with our dog, Dude, Emma, and our three boys... Bennie, Benjamin, and Benzo.<eos> So I guess I'll go with a hug?<eos> Yeah, I meant what do you think Amanda is going to do since she invited you to be her date?
I know.<eos> Why don't you come with me and hit on Amanda?<eos> She's kind of a sure thing.<eos> Wait, wait, wait.<eos> What about the girl who led you to Amanda?
- Excuse me?<eos> - I've said too much.<eos> She knows me so well.<eos> Sometimes I think she's got a GPS planted in me.<eos> Aha! Yeah. I caught you with your hand in the skank jar.
I did!<eos> Oh! Ow. You!<eos> I got you pregnant.<eos> And Dr. Marsh is my mom's doc.<eos> I lied to you because I knew he was a good doctor, and I wanted you to have the best because you're carrying our baby and I love you.
But I am not a rough-it kind of a gal.<eos> Okay?<eos> And instead of a year... how about we just go away for a long weekend?<eos> Oh. Oh, and, honey, thanks for trying to help.<eos> I'm sorry I put so much pressure on you.
Wish I could divorce both my parents.<eos> You know what I've learned?<eos> You don't have to stick with the family you were born into.<eos> We can make a new one.<eos> And you have Cal, who loves you like a father.
You know, I'll<eos> I'll let you know.<eos> Listen, man.<eos> Go ahead. Go inside.<eos> They're waiting for you.
Now, one of you tell me what's going on.<eos> It's complicated, kid.<eos> Dad.<eos> Bye, Eddie.<eos> Cal, please I think it's best if your dad explained this one to you.
And as much as I want to protect history, I want to protect our family more.<eos> We both should have learned by now, the mission comes first.<eos> Thank you for telling me.<eos> I was just trying to protect you.<eos> Nathaniel, changing your family's history would have changed you.
Nathaniel, changing your family's history would have changed you.<eos> And in case I haven't made it clear, I like who you are.<eos> You and I don't have a future together.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> When you stowed aboard the Waverider, we pulled you from the timeline.
And in case I haven't made it clear, I like who you are.<eos> You and I don't have a future together.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> When you stowed aboard the Waverider, we pulled you from the timeline.<eos> Back in 1942, you have a destiny waiting for you.
Right, there should be a lever to your, uh, to your left.<eos> I see it.<eos> Hey! Hey, don't! Don't do this.<eos> I am so sorry, Nathaniel.<eos> No, no, you open that door, the explosive decompression will suck you out.
We broke it into four separate pieces.<eos> Mr. Hunter took one...<eos> And took the rest of you to three different time periods, which means the last piece unaccounted for must be with your grandfather.<eos> Waverider crew, we are now the proud owners of the last fragment of the Spear of Destiny.<eos> Back in 1942, you have a destiny waiting for you.
I don't even know who that guy is.<eos> All I know is I gotta find this hobbit guy who knows the guy who's buried with Jesus' blood.<eos> Then we can destroy the Spear of Destiny.<eos> Mick, Mick, Mick, when have we ever destroyed anything we've ever stolen, let alone the most valuable score in the universe?<eos> What have they done to you?
But he does have partners.<eos> So what do you say, partner?<eos> Mick, you're better than this.<eos> No, actually, you're not.<eos> They may pretend to believe in you as long as they can use you, but they'll just as soon let you die, same as they did me.
Because there's no reason for one.<eos> Our partnership has ended.<eos> You got what you wanted.<eos> Your wife and your son are both alive and in good spirits.<eos> Your daughter Thea adores you.
If it wasn't for you, we never would have been turned into sheep in the first place.<eos> We trusted you, Mick.<eos> We can't afford to make that mistake again.<eos> Let's go.<eos> League of losers cut you loose?
Like me destroying the Spear and cementing this reality for all time.<eos> Martin.<eos> The reactor is fully operational, sir.<eos> This... is the only reality any of you will ever know.<eos> We'll never give up trying to stop you.
J'excused.<eos> Is that my phone?<eos> Get your thumbs off it.<eos> I don't know where you bowl.<eos> I'm signing you up for TaskRabbit.
You're thinking about wings.<eos> Wondering if I have my wallet in my pocket.<eos> You're also probably thinking about that new issue of Guns Ammo that you got in the mail this morning?<eos> Other than that, it's pretty echo-y in there, I'm guessing.<eos> Used to when I met you, you were funny.
He told me that he was gonna go to HPD, okay?<eos> Both of us would've gone down.<eos> I did what I had to do.<eos> Here's what's gonna happen now.<eos> You're gonna tell them that Akemoto approached you after you got out, talked you into doing those robberies.
Look, my client will be here, and if for some reason he's not, that is on me and only me.<eos> I'm gonna go shout into a toilet.<eos> Okay, well, what are we gonna do now?<eos> Babe, we are not gonna do anything, okay?<eos> You have done so much for me, more than any normal person, and I love you.
Of course she was.<eos> She's supposed to. I told you to be careful about the people you bring into this house.<eos> There are spies everywhere!<eos> She's not a spy.<eos> She was here to help you. Shh!
Elvis Presley. He's a very famous rock and roll singer.<eos> Ah! Oh, my gosh!<eos> I'd almost forgotten about this.<eos> What is that?<eos> When you were a little boy, I took you to the circus, and after that, all you could talk about is you wanted to be a tightrope walker when you grew up.
Stay with me tonight.<eos> I don't need this pressure right now.<eos> We need each other, especially right now.<eos> I need my friends, too.<eos> But I'm the one that holds you at night.
I just wanted to make sure you're all right.<eos> You're sweet, but I still need a minute.<eos> I need to tell you...<eos> I thought my life was over when you left.<eos> I'm sorry I pushed you away, baby.
Dad: Spencer, please go to the other room.<eos> Mom: Don't treat him like a child.<eos> Dad: I'm not gonna have this conversation in front of him.<eos> Mom: I'm not crazy.<eos> If you refuse to take care of yourself, I can't help you.
I don't know. I don't know.<eos> But she helped us and I trusted her.<eos> I was right to.<eos> I still believe that.<eos> Well, she convinced you to cross the border multiple times.
Is that my vintage Corona Club beach towel? Yes.<eos> I was in the pool, but I got out.<eos> That's a beach towel, not a pool... and it...<eos> Where were you?<eos> I was referring to you as my funky Asian friend.
Lady.<eos> Uhtred.<eos> Uhtred, forgive me, but I have asked the King to excuse me from this journey to Beamfleot.<eos> For my sins, God has always placed me at your side.<eos> And I feel... shame for abandoning you.
And then what?<eos> We bring him to the rendezvous point, lay low, move him early in the morning when German intelligence thinks he's asleep.<eos> Nice try.<eos> But while Marcus might have been asleep, German intelligence was not.<eos> They spotted you... and caught up with you.
The Austrian border is 50 miles.<eos> No customs.<eos> No searches.<eos> And they like American dollars.<eos> No planned searches, but they can always pull you over.
Why?<eos> Because when you exfiltrate someone, your target is in real danger.<eos> And now so am I, so you better act fast and come up with a plan to get me out by the end of the day.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Is this about what I showed you earlier?
We were broke when she died!<eos> She believed in what we were doing, Daniel.<eos> No!<eos> She believed in you.<eos> She trusted you.
A program can't take into account human emotions, people covering for others, people forced to do things they didn't want to.<eos> We're not doing good here.<eos> So what are we supposed to do now?<eos> We get them arrested.<eos> I pushed you out to protect you.
I haven't seen MY true face in years.<eos> Swapped it for this one on the run.<eos> Oh, look, Bill, it's Nardole!<eos> What a lovely surprise!<eos> Thought I sent you to Birmingham for a packet of crisps.
- "Got an A star."<eos> I've lived in Roman Britain.<eos> Governed.<eos> Farmed. Juggled.<eos> And speaking as a former vestal virgin, second class, I can assure you...
I'm gonna go to town on some hot D.<eos> Desserts!<eos> [Perry] Kimmy?<eos> [Kimmy] Perry!<eos> Finally. I keep thinking I see you from behind, but it always turns out to be a Josh Goldberg.
Doctors, bakers, mechanics, concerned citizens lending helping hands to those in need.<eos> Well, this is Syria.<eos> You might wanna help yourself and find a weapon for protection.<eos> These are the only weapons I need.<eos> - Now let me treat you.
You don't work here anymore, remember?<eos> Now get washed up and go.<eos> These facilities are for employees only.<eos> What's your name?<eos> This man held you captive and now you treat him?
Exactly, but what the D.O.E. rep said was mathematically inaccuracy.<eos> And I told him.<eos> Repeatedly.<eos> I mean, don't people want to better themselves?<eos> The irony of that question is completely lost on you, isn't it?
And we'll eventually die from hypothermia, so all this debris, it's gonna save our lives.<eos> We're gonna have to build a raft.<eos> Let's go.<eos> ♪ Early in the morning. ♪ Toby, I swear to God,<eos> I'm gonna grab you by the ankles and swab the deck with your head.
They won't.<eos> Dad, unless you want to go to prison, you need to trust me.<eos> I need to take a walk.<eos> I need to think.<eos> But I just got you back in my life.
These guys love vegetables.<eos> Okay, dad.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Come on, dad.<eos> I love you, sweetheart.
I'd say, "Unless the demand for creepy-looking gigolos "has gone through the roof, that's bollocks."<eos> Yeah, funny.<eos> Here.<eos> Have a chuckle at that.<eos> Plus, I've got something else that could interest you.
- Excellent.<eos> More than excellent, mate.<eos> - You'll probably need to bring a sick bag.<eos> - Why's that?<eos> Because... I'm taking you on a roller-coaster ride of sexual thrills.
And sooner or later people will find out.<eos> You're not proper businessmen, you're not salesmen.<eos> You're hustlers.<eos> You're fairground workers in shiny suits, selling a product as worthless as you are.<eos> Is this because I called you a little prick?
- Ouch.<eos> Might need a rabies shot for that, mate.<eos> Don't push your luck, mate.<eos> I've basically whored myself<eos> - to clear the coast for you.
No.<eos> Course not, it's a mug's game.<eos> Ronnie, you don't want to get a pint, do ya?<eos> I've got something I'd like to get your advice on.<eos> So what can I help you with, Vincent?
Because your son's teacher is in the showroom and she wants to talk to you.<eos> She seems upset.<eos> Shit.<eos> Does she know I'm upstairs?<eos> No, but she's not leaving until she sees you.
Oleg, um... _<eos> - Hey. So, I saw her again.<eos> Oh, the gym lady?<eos> You ask her out this time?<eos> What is wrong with you? I mean, I talked to her.
All right.<eos> So, does Morozov know about bugs?<eos> I don't know.<eos> He's an agricultural expert.<eos> Has he said anything to you about bugs?
Uh, we just need to talk to you for a minute.<eos> Is it about Matthew?<eos> I don't want to.<eos> We need a minute.<eos> We can't stop you from seeing him, but we can help you manage things so the relationship is safer.
I'm... I'm fine. I just, uh...<eos> Is that it?<eos> Well, yeah. I got a B on my last paper,<eos> So I got to pull my grade up.<eos> Okay. I can help you with that.
Not a clue.<eos> Make sure you check out the new soap dispensers in the bathrooms.<eos> Aderholt.<eos> Well, duty calls.<eos> Nice meeting you, Henry.
I mean, this... that's insane!<eos> That's an understatement.<eos> Okay, let me get dressed.<eos> Lucy, no, no, no...<eos> Lucy. I'm not dragging you into this.
Some guys said, "Whoa, whoa, whoa." Fair enough.<eos> And some guys were like, "Oh, okay."<eos> And I rejected them.<eos> They shared with me their deepest secret, and one fantastic human being to share with me.<eos> Babe, I love you, and... I think you should know, my dad's in the mafia.
Jesus, what is this, a speech?<eos> Yeah, and then after the show she gives these shoulder-based hugs.<eos> Does she even give a shit?<eos> Well, why don't you click on my... my new Snapchat story?<eos> I love you, but I have glasses and a big mustache.
I wish I had paid to see that show.<eos> But I was always on the guest list.<eos> Uh, I had to take a break from work 'cause, uh, I went mental.<eos> And, uh... my friend told me, hey, you're talking a little too fast, having a lot of shit ideas.<eos> Uh, why don't you get in my Ford Flex, and I'll, uh, motor you over to the public storage.
So, you're my best friend.<eos> I love you, okay?<eos> Only you.<eos> It's just me and you, okay?<eos> "And literally loving you."
Are you in love?<eos> What?<eos> No, no, I barely know her.<eos> Okay. Okay, that's good.<eos> Then, we just need to extricate you from this situation.
I mean, he was very honest about the whole Keenan vortex thing, so.<eos> Well, you don't think his discussing the vortex is just a way of pulling you into the vortex?<eos> No. Wh-why would he... wh...<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> Okay, look, Richard, what I'm about to tell you is a huge breach of ethics, but it's gonna save you from making a big mistake.
Richard, it's not that easy.<eos> There's always a next time and a next time and a next time.<eos> I cannot knowingly contribute to your moral decay.<eos> Well, what if you didn't do it...<eos> You're always telling me how you spent your entire childhood pretending that everything going on around you was okay.
Sure, but when I sold my last company, I realized I had the luxury to invest in something I believe in.<eos> - Mmm. - Helping humanity thrive.<eos> That's why I decided to bring PeaceFare into the world.<eos> Ah, good for you.<eos> It was great to meet you, Richard.
Come on. Let's go, let's go. Start unloading it.<eos> Hey, man, so did you ever transfer all that data?<eos> No, we just gotta unload our servers near the Sherlock arrays.<eos> Servers?<eos> Richard, man, I told you, now is not a good time for this.
- It was the right thing.<eos> - How the hell would you know that?<eos> - Sorry, Kady.<eos> - Our lady sent me.<eos> - Hey, I'm sorry I hurt you.
- Two.<eos> Please, just... just drop the gun and we can talk.<eos> To hell with this.<eos> Sebastian!<eos> They kicked you out?
I don't want to kill anybody ever again, not for them, not for my country.<eos> I follow orders.<eos> You don't.<eos> That's why you're leaving and I'm not.<eos> What did they do to you?
Yeah.<eos> We need Helena's location, and you're going to tell me.<eos> So where did she go, Mr. Hendrix?<eos> I already told you, I don't know.<eos> Abandoned you, did she?
She kicked me out of the house because we had an affair.<eos> If anyone had been home, they could have saved her.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> And we can't change the past.<eos> Yeah. It's good to see you, Alison.
Hey, Danny.<eos> What's up?<eos> - You are?<eos> - I'm Nikki.<eos> Maddie had some shit to do after school and asked me to meet you.
Maddie, dinner's ready.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Finishing some math stuff.<eos> Hi, Danny!<eos> I'm sorry I wasn't here to let you in.
No one has to tell me... it's obvious.<eos> If you don't get married now, what else will you do?<eos> Don't be shy, tell me?<eos> You can drop this stupid idea for good.<eos> I am not interested in marrying you.
Papa, it's not my fault that he was a crook.<eos> I only wanted to start this business for everyone's benefit.<eos> How many times have I tried to tell you... people always try to cheat girls.<eos> I cannot blame you since I am the unlucky one.<eos> So? She left you stranded in the parking?
Ms. Vaidehi.<eos> Yes.<eos> I know all about what that boy did with you.<eos> I can understand that you're in shock.<eos> But I am stilling willing to marry you.
Talk to me...<eos> Say something.<eos> Throw these guys out.<eos> Be reasonable, father!<eos> I've been asking you to reduce it for a while...
Take care.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hurry up... haven't you eaten?<eos> Badri.<eos> What brings you here?
When are going to pay up?<eos> I will pay tomorrow..<eos> If you can pay tomorrow, Then why not today?<eos> Stay back, or else I will throw you out of the city.<eos> When no one was willing to lend money to your father... my family trusted you, didn't we? Yes.
One more and you could've had your own small army!<eos> What the hell?<eos> Stop laughing at my life!<eos> Badri...<eos> Father's calling you. they've found Vaidehi.
Badri!<eos> Badri, please let me out.<eos> What you're doing is not right, Badri.<eos> You won't get away with this.<eos> If the police catch you, they will throw you behind bars.
Show everyone the consequences of running away.<eos> Then why did you stop?<eos> Let's go to Jhansi.<eos> That's exactly what I wanted to do.<eos> But I love you too much... it weakens me.
Get it.<eos> Mr. Badri, out here in Singapore... we're not used to staying up late at nights.<eos> So my suggestion is that... you two stay away from each other.<eos> I don't want to go anywhere near her!<eos> Lein's calling you.
Last warning?<eos> Yes, last...<eos> What do you want? I said shut up!<eos> Shut up!<eos> She abandoned you on your wedding.
Now she's right in front of you... but you're helpless.<eos> You know what? Just keep wasting fuel chasing her. That's all you can do...<eos> I told you to shut up!<eos> Bickering nonsense like an old hag.<eos> See, I hit you now.
Badri.<eos> I have to go.<eos> I've made food for you two. It's in the fridge.<eos> So... reheat it whenever you want to eat.<eos> And... I even made pudding for you.
Let me see.<eos> I've been observing that you study really hard.<eos> But do you understand any of it?<eos> I mean, when children study... In fact, when I used to study my brother would test me.<eos> So... are how much of this you remember. Do you want me to test you?
When she does... we will all have to retire.<eos> I am hanging up now, international calls are expensive.<eos> I will call you later.<eos> Kritika, I love you.<eos> I love you too.
I've been watching you all these days... You're shone so much strength.<eos> You're making your own world here.<eos> I always believed... that I am the only man in all of Jhansi.<eos> That whoever marries me will be really lucky.<eos> But after meeting you, I realized... whoever marries you will be the lucky one.
What's the point of lying..<eos> It's alright.<eos> If I see her, I will kill her my self.<eos> You don't worry.<eos> I've chosen a really nice bride for you.
Badri.<eos> You're drunk on the day of the prayer-meet.<eos> You will get us in trouble, Badri.<eos> Get down...<eos> They are calling you inside.
- Hmm?<eos> Chad Thompson had a birthday party last week and Teddy wasn't invited.<eos> What?<eos> Wait, which one's Chad Thompson?<eos> The one that calls you "toots"?
Yeah.<eos> Uh, look, honey, I'm sorry, I can't get out<eos> - of this meeting, but I...<eos> - It's okay.<eos> I'm really proud of you for handling this.
- Just like we practiced.<eos> - Yeah, I got it.<eos> Hello.<eos> I am a man.<eos> And I have loved you for a very long time.
Look at the smile on her face.<eos> Something's going on with that back paw.<eos> Hello.<eos> I am a man.<eos> And I have loved you for a very long time.
Well, that's why I think you should invite him.<eos> I saw him at the grocery store today, and he was obviously lonely.<eos> He's just not the kind of guy that Don and I hang out with.<eos> Well, I mean, is that such a bad thing?<eos> I mean, Don, you know, I love you, but when you two are together, half your sentences end with,
You really think you can do this presentation without my help?<eos> Why not?<eos> You think you can do the presentation without my help.<eos> That's not what I said.<eos> I'm sorry, I can't hear you.
I think what Adam is saying is he loves you.<eos> What?<eos> N-N-No, I'm not.<eos> No. Well, good, 'cause I would've kicked your ass.<eos> Aw, he loves you, too.
- Oh, is it Kate?<eos> Well, let me check.<eos> Uh, no.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> No, that's a, uh, uh, an alarm that I set for myself to remind me to tell you that I love you.
The other victim is the captain.<eos> Jorge Valdo.<eos> Triple tap to the chest.<eos> That's on me.<eos> Remind me not to piss you off.
Time for some more field work.<eos> The cartel is building a foundation.<eos> Legitimate companies give them the ability to wield influence.<eos> Your family is one of the most respected in New Orleans.<eos> If he marries you, it gives him access to politicians, to decision makers.
You stopped me from making a horrible mistake.<eos> Saved my family's name.<eos> Looked out for me, the way you always have.<eos> Gonna be hard for a while.<eos> FBI will take you to a safe house until Javier and his organization are dismantled.
Previously on The Magicians...<eos> My hands won't cast.<eos> - We can help you, Penny.
I don't want it.<eos> You want to be President of this entire idiotic country.<eos> You have always sensed your place.<eos> Julia and Kady, they said you did terrible things.<eos> I should've looked you up on the spot.
Why don't we get tracksuits and play chess at the park?<eos> I already got a chess crew.<eos> You do that right outside of the loft?<eos> - Yeah, right outside the loft.<eos> - How have I never seen you once?
Tell me, do you have any modeling experience?<eos> I was trapped in a window display in a department store once, and I was on the news a lot.<eos> Are we talking local or national news?<eos> Oh, that's a good question.<eos> I think... sorry... what my friend is trying to say is that it sounds like you have on-camera experience, and if you would like, we can hook you up with a top talent manager who could get you an audition today.
Last week, uh, Mario Lopez was on Clash of the Cupcakes.<eos> That was pretty harrowing, too.<eos> To be clear, I was joking, but...<eos> I mean, Mario Lopez was on the show, but... he's a pretty nice guy.<eos> Right. Well, Sona... It's so great to see you.
My eminence is too easy to spot from afar.<eos> If only we had someone they'd never seen--<eos> Guys, stop the bit.<eos> I'll go.<eos> Eternal glory awaits you, O Joshua of Yonkers.
I'm done.<eos> Great.<eos> Here's your overdue book.<eos> Now can you find me some shit to help with my hands, please?<eos> I will look for some thing to help you with that in just a moment.
I understand.<eos> I'll tell you everything I know.<eos> It's just...<eos> I thought I'd never see you again.<eos> The Beast, he-- he tore you apart piece by piece, but not just your body, but your--your Shade, everything.
Are you okay?<eos> I'm whole again.<eos> Which is a... a good thing.<eos> If by good you mean crying jags and mountains of guilt and panic attacks, then, yeah, I'm doing fu... great.<eos> And since I better be getting back to one of them soon, whether I like it or not, how can I help you?
- I want to help.<eos> - I'm here, Alice, because it is you who needs help.<eos> - What?<eos> - As a niffin, you made enemies.<eos> I'm here to warn you that one of them seeks you.
"We"?<eos> Yeah, didn't you hear the part where I said "I love you"?<eos> No. I heard the part where you said I was the worst.<eos> Well...<eos> I meant I love you.
Yeah, didn't you hear the part where I said "I love you"?<eos> No. I heard the part where you said I was the worst.<eos> Well...<eos> I meant I love you.<eos> I love you, too.
It's just... hard.<eos> With work and her parents.<eos> Heather.<eos> How the fuck did this become my life?<eos> Well, would you like me to walk you through it?
I can be dead inside.<eos> I mean, I have been for 15 years, drivin' past the water tower.<eos> Look, to be honest, Colt... I don't wanna sit in a car with someone for 30 minutes who doesn't believe in what I'm doing.<eos> Uh, what I believe doesn't matter right now.<eos> I mean, if we were havin' this baby, I would drive you to the hospital and I'd be there for the entire thing.
What are you doin' with my tools?<eos> I'm going to help Mom.<eos> Bar flooded.<eos> I didn't hear anything about that.<eos> Well, that's the way you want it, right? No one bothering' you?
I'll delete it.<eos> Oh, that's a fair price for our cattle. Yeah.<eos> I'm sure we could make a business deal.<eos> Send the pic.<eos> I'll call you later.
The sexual harassment seminar?<eos> Yeah, man, that one!<eos> Rooster, I'd love to help you, but I can't.<eos> But you're the one who hired me there.<eos> I mean, they're obviously gonna listen to you.
- All right.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> - Garth fucking Brooks?<eos> - Yeah!<eos> Oh, my God, I love you so much!
Did I mention I got fired?<eos> There you go, you're up to date.<eos> Have you told your family?<eos> I just said I didn't want to talk about it.<eos> Honey, I'm just trying to help you.
No, thanks.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> - All right.<eos> I tried.<eos> - Good to see you too, Dad.
Now, just...<eos> You make a good point.<eos> Looks like someone got tickets to the gun show.<eos> Unfortunately, someone else got season passes.<eos> Can I help you? Oh.
So, I can teach you how to do a half nelson or solve for x.<eos> Wrestling, huh?<eos> You ever teach a boy an advanced pinning' technique?<eos> - I don't think I know what that is.<eos> What brings you to Garrison, Paul?
- I... I don't know.<eos> - Rooster.<eos> - I mean, yeah, probably.<eos> - That's just it.<eos> I never wanna get in the way of you and what makes you happy.
Nothing moves fast.<eos> I'm just sayin', we've... we've never gone to dinner, we've never gone dancing... and you've never met my horses.<eos> - You have horses?<eos> - Two. Butch and Sundance.<eos> You shouldn't tell me stuff like that if you don't want me to kiss you again.
Mom, this guy bothering' you?<eos> - Want me to kick the shit out of him?<eos> - Colt.<eos> Yeah, relax, Colt. You can't even fix a generator.<eos> This guy bothering you, Mom?
We can get Golden Corral to go.<eos> Actually, uh, my granddaughter's here.<eos> Her mom was supposed to pick her up an hour ago.<eos> I haven't heard from her yet.<eos> Oh, and I tried to call you before you got all the way out here.
Should cover all the doctor's bills.<eos> And... and I'll have more once I get paid from Safeway.<eos> Safeway?<eos> What happened?<eos> One of their trucks hit you in the parking lot?
Do you really want this?<eos> I do, Beau.<eos> I'm gonna miss you, Mags.<eos> I'm gonna miss you, too.<eos> And I love you, Beau.
I do, Beau.<eos> I'm gonna miss you, Mags.<eos> I'm gonna miss you, too.<eos> And I love you, Beau.<eos> I love you, too.
I mean, I'm not excited about it like when you left.<eos> Why are you enabling this shit?<eos> Dude, I'm running a bar now.<eos> I'm gonna be enabling all kinds of shit.<eos> Did you hear anything I said to you earlier?
Let the nerding out begin!<eos> Welcome to the windy city tech summit.<eos> Yeah, nice try, Gideon.<eos> What?<eos> I was just introducing you to the convention.
I'll be mobbed.<eos> Autographs, unsolicited pitches...<eos> All right, well, you should be happy.<eos> That they still want you to kiss their babies.<eos> They might not love you for much longer. What?
Shut up.<eos> I'm looking at boring people with gray boxes.<eos> With Milliscan...<eos> Do you know what their market cap is, their valuation?<eos> I can't hear you. I'm asleep.
Talk to me.<eos> Mr. Finley, this is officer Brandt, Chicago Police.<eos> You don't want to do this.<eos> Just tell me what's going through your mind.<eos> Let us help you.

You said that...<eos> I said a lot of stupid things.<eos> I just...<eos> Look, Why don't you just get down off there, And we'll...<eos> What he's trying to say. Is he loves you.
As you know, I grew up as an only child.<eos> And I always wanted a big brother.<eos> And when I started working with the Five-0, I finally got one.<eos> Mahalo, Max.<eos> This might be a surprise to you, but I always considered you as something of a role model.
Maria Theresa of Austria, Queen of France,<eos> Queen Consort of Navarre.<eos> My mother performed the same role with distinction<eos> I know I can rely on you to do the same.<eos> I'll take you to the salon to effect some key introductions.
Hey, Tim. Where the fuck is that mozzarella?<eos> I'm kidding.<eos> I love you.<eos> I mean it.<eos> I'm inviting you to my next barbecue.
You don't want to do it?<eos> It's just that I'm not super passionate about the show.<eos> And if I'm doing it for seven seasons, that's a long time.<eos> And I... I don't think it'd be fair to you or to me if I... if I did something like that without my heart being fully invested in it, you know what I mean?<eos> I hope I'm not pissing you off or pissing the network off...
Now, y'all ain't got no business listening to these songs.<eos> Look at Denise over there, staring at D'Angelo.<eos> Denise, put on your dress so you can look nice for dinner.<eos> Man, this is some bullshit.<eos> Denise, that does not look like the clothes I picked out for you.
They're sitting there like, "Oh, I can't believe we waited this long for tapas.<eos> I didn't even want tapas."<eos> "What are you talking about? You're the one that suggested tapas."<eos> "No, I suggested Thai food."<eos> "Oh, I can't believe this. I should have never married you. I should have listened to my father."
No, this is getting a little weird.<eos> Want to switch roles?<eos> I mean, I'm not sure why, but sure.<eos> Francesca, there's a chemical bond between us that we cannot deny.<eos> I want to pick you up and carry you away from Pino and toss you in the ocean and then give you kissies.
Wow, this is so cool.<eos> Look at this.<eos> Yeah, it's nice.<eos> Nice? I mean, it's amazing.<eos> Come on, what's going on with you?
I want to laugh with you. I want to define random English words.<eos> I-I just want to be with you.<eos> You make me so happy, and I think I make you pretty happy, too.<eos> These past few weeks have been so amazing.<eos> And there's so many times I just wanted to grab you and kiss you.
Is that the best you've got?<eos> My God, the way you've changed!<eos> You've become coarser.<eos> She had you nailed from the start.<eos> She's transformed you before my very eyes.
What is wrong?<eos> Where is Ivar?<eos> Don't worry about Ivar. He has other things on his mind.<eos> I've missed you.<eos> I didn't know if you would forgive me. - For tricking you.
We need ambitious men.<eos> I still have a bone to pick with you, Sigurd.<eos> Why were you silent when I demanded justice from Lagertha?<eos> We have different memories of Mother.<eos> She doted on you, and she ignored me.
She has been poisoned and I think I know who did it!<eos> Do not be ridiculous!<eos> You yourself said you would declare war on her!<eos> I may dislike her clothes, I may mock her,<eos> I may hate her for stealing you from me and in the dark of night, I have wished her dead, but I wouldn't go so far as to make her dead.
Why?<eos> Because I wanted to discuss the weather over Armagnac and macaroons.<eos> What do you think?<eos> You're making it worse!<eos> Why won't you let me help you?
Mon cherie, let Garfield give you a big hug.<eos> Mmm, so soft.<eos> I let you go for a little kiss.<eos> Kill her!<eos> Now, witch, you get what's coming to you!
Even if they are on a roof.<eos> I know what it's like not to fit in with the group.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Aside from Monkey Boy making me melt down or Raven staring all the time Nightwing, acting like a den mother, Jaime and his freako bug Miss Smiles-a-lot, and you, my new stalker huh, nothing I guess.<eos> If you need to talk let us help you.
You would think he truly cares.<eos> Slade?<eos> Look what hell just spit up.<eos> Stay back.<eos> Let me guess, they got you to a Lazarus Pit, just in time.
After all, I'm not even from your world.<eos> Hey.<eos> Stop.<eos> You were chosen by the team to lead them.<eos> And have I told you how glad I am that you've chosen to move in with me?
I hear you.<eos> Guys, Raven's not moving.<eos> Something's keeping me from using my powers to morph.<eos> Yeah, the machine's doing that.<eos> But I'm the one who put you here.
It ruins the machine's symmetry.<eos> We agreed some deaths might be unavoidable.<eos> - Things happen.<eos> - I accept that.<eos> But I told you even in death there is life to be drawn. Where is the body?
You said that you wanted to go live with your dad.<eos> Did you mean that?<eos> Not really.<eos> Then why'd you say it?<eos> Did your dad tell you to say that?
Did I kill my mom?<eos> No. It's not your fault.<eos> On the sole count of first degree murder, the jury finds the defendant, Jaxson Clark, guilty.<eos> Before you people started to deliberate,<eos> I instructed you on how to apply the law regarding murder.
Once.<eos> Clark is getting a total pass.<eos> You know what I think?<eos> I think you should go home, go to sleep.<eos> I guarantee you, you wake up in the morning, there will be a brand new bad guy waiting for you.
Help me be honest in--<eos> - Gonna get an early start?<eos> - Yeah, I gotta get down to San Diego.<eos> Oh, that's too bad.<eos> I wanted to take you out to breakfast to thank you for last night.
London-- - But now it's just, like, all the time.<eos> London...<eos> It's okay.<eos> You came to the right place.<eos> We can help you.
London...<eos> It's okay.<eos> You came to the right place.<eos> We can help you.<eos> WAKE can help you.
Riggs, people at work finally forgot that I had a heart attack last year, so not a word of this to them, or to Trish.<eos> I don't want to worry her.<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> Just make sure you let me know, and Trish better not find out.<eos> All right? She'll forgive you and and hate me forever. Then where will I eat?
Got nothing but time, Roger.<eos> Isn't the statute of limitations on a grudge up after, like, 15 years?<eos> There's no limitations on destroying a man's career.<eos> I was your training officer.<eos> It was my obligation to assess you as honestly as I could.
Now, tell me everything.<eos> You two made a mistake.<eos> Dino's clean.<eos> Turn over another stone.<eos> This is why I love you.
We just track your phone.<eos> Technology.<eos> Trish set me up?<eos> Trish is on your side, all right?<eos> She's trying to help you.
Look, Dino, you've been working really hard to clean up your life, right?<eos> It'd be a shame for it to end all right here.<eos> They kidnapped my brother.<eos> Okay? And they will kill him if I don't pay up.<eos> So let me help you, all right?
Excited?<eos> Itchy?<eos> Give me the first letter.<eos> You and I are in a relationship.<eos> I help you with your shortcomings, and you help me with mine.
- Why?<eos> - My father...<eos> She can't defend herself.<eos> He's a monster.<eos> I know you're still angry with your dad for sending you here.
Expel me.<eos> I hate it here.<eos> No... you don't get off that easy.<eos> You need this school more than you know.<eos> Now go outside... and wait for security to escort you back to the dorms.
His chief engineer at the time.<eos> This afternoon, Edison and Ford are going to meet with their financier, J.P. Morgan.<eos> They'll be in a heavily guarded room... very difficult to get into, even for me, even in 1893.<eos> But still, before they show up, I'm gonna plant a bomb there.<eos> I'm not going to help you.
How?<eos> I've been hiding a long time, Sarah.<eos> If you can get Kira out from under their surveillance, then I can move you today.<eos> Hey, MK, you're with us now.<eos> All right? And there's nobody who can help you more than our sister Cosima.
I'm coming to get you, you are not giving up.<eos> MK?<eos> No, no. All right?<eos> This isn't the plan.<eos> I'll take you to Scott.
[Rago] I definitely have a little bit of nervousness going.<eos> How much talking is too much talking?<eos> Is getting personal a bad thing?<eos> Like, "This one was one of the more difficult sites for me to go back to."<eos> [Vevers] Really good to show that it actually affected you.
Holy shit.<eos> The World Anti-Doping Agency suspended Russia's sports drug-testing lab, and the head of the lab resigned.<eos> Grisha, be careful what you tell him now.<eos> Don't tell me. I am just...<eos> They're holding on the phone for you.
I don't know what's going on.<eos> I just know what I'm reading in the newspaper and in the press and... You know.<eos> Oh, really? Really?<eos> I mean, will they come after you?<eos> Are they gonna arrest you? Are they gonna...
I just know what I'm reading in the newspaper and in the press and... You know.<eos> Oh, really? Really?<eos> I mean, will they come after you?<eos> Are they gonna arrest you? Are they gonna...<eos> Would they try to put you in jail?
- Yes.<eos> - Joking, you know, seriousness aside...<eos> - Stop it. Stop, stop.<eos> I'm just... I'm worried about you.<eos> Tomorrow, I drop you.
Ray Ray.<eos> - Boo Boo?<eos> - Is this about the apartment?<eos> - Damn.<eos> - Jess, I know I put you in a weird spot by telling you about it.
You can't, but we can.<eos> Jess, I can't make you do that.<eos> I mean, you had a whole day planned.<eos> I mean, it's a day I maintain was rooted in sadness.<eos> You say I'm sad one more time, and I'm gonna take you to San Francisco, and we're gonna eat a little sourdough, maybe a little crab, and then I'm gonna throw you off the Golden Gate Bridge!
I'll just pick my favorite on the way over.<eos> Sit down, you nincompoop.<eos> This is completely my fault.<eos> I just really wanted to do something big for you, because you do so many romantic things for me.<eos> And I just wanted to find some way to show you... how much I love you.
Hey.<eos> Please come in.<eos> Hey, thank you.<eos> Thanks, Max.<eos> What brings you around in the neighborhood?
That's the most important thing in the world.<eos> I'm proud of you.<eos> I'm so proud of you.<eos> And also you should know that, from personal experience, it doesn't matter how far you travel or where you go, you can always come back home, okay?<eos> And if you ever do decide to do that, you got a job and got your Five-O ohana waiting for you.
Did Nardole send you to speak to me?<eos> Might have done.<eos> Might have said there was something you ought to tell me.<eos> Funny thing, fear, isn't it?<eos> Once it rules you, you're even afraid to admit what's scaring you.
What I want, more than anything, is to feel like I left the world a better place.<eos> And that for doing so, I was richly rewarded with a medical patent worth billions of dollars.<eos> Which I would then drop into the ghettos, barrios and favelas of the world from my helicopter with Chakrabarti painted down the side.<eos> - Chakrabarti!<eos> - I love you, Ravi.

Oh! Someone else has noticed us.<eos> Sorry, what do you mean, it's his real name?<eos> Nobody knows the Doctor's real name.<eos> I do, because I grew up with him, and his real name is Doctor Who.<eos> Bill, she's just trying to wind you up.
Hello, Missy.<eos> I'm the Master, and I'm very worried about my future.<eos> Give us a kiss!<eos> Bill? Bill, talk to me.<eos> What have they done to you?
He's internalising.<eos> I love it when he's Mr Volcano.<eos> The last time I saw you, you were on your way to Gallifrey.<eos> Well, I didn't stay... why would I stay?<eos> So they cured your little condition and kicked you out.
Why do I see a Cyberman in the mirror?<eos> What do you remember?<eos> There's quite a lot! You know?<eos> I was down there for ten years.<eos> And then, one day... they took you to the conversion theatre.
And then, one day... they took you to the conversion theatre.<eos> - Do you remember that? - No.<eos> Bits of it...<eos> You turned up.<eos> Do you remember what they did to you?
These guys want to prove to the world that zombies exist.<eos> You're on a livestream.<eos> I'm hungry, if you know what I mean.<eos> That's kind of the point.<eos> They're going to starve you past the point of no return.
It all seems obvious when you say it out loud like that.<eos> Mmm, time to take the edge off this old boy.<eos> See that vein in his neck?<eos> It becomes more distinct when he leans forward.<eos> Where's that phone Blaine gave you?
Who'd wanna be seen with an uggo like me, right?<eos> You know that's not it.<eos> I was so haunted by the way that you died that I tried to push you out of my mind completely.<eos> I've been diving into all these different brains, at least in part, so that I don't have to live inside my own head.<eos> Face the grief of losing you.
I'm not telling you who to do business with, but just be a little careful.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Look, I don't have much for you.<eos> What do you mean, you don't have much for me?<eos> I told you this shit is gonna take some time. Two months is time.
Are you okay?<eos> Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> It was, um, it was a little scary.<eos> It wasn't Craig's fault.<eos> I haven't seen you at school.
And if I'm being honest with you, I'm starting to freak out now.<eos> This is me freaking out.<eos> Do I sometimes wonder if you're a robot?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I've made you!
- How come you never visit?<eos> - 'Cause you're so old and moving is so hard?<eos> You owe us, like, a lot of birthday presents.<eos> You used to be a big deal!<eos> Whatever happened to you?
Would you settle for his hat?<eos> There's your head.<eos> I should've been more specific!<eos> We can explain.<eos> We came down to your secret museum to look for you, because we love you?
- Oh my God!<eos> - Gabi, you lied to me.<eos> - Oh, so you do know.<eos> What is wrong with you?<eos> Josh specifically told you to stay out of it.
Remember when I told you I was with my dad this afternoon?<eos> I wasn't.<eos> See, the thing is I never met him, and I made the whole thing up.<eos> What?<eos> I just told you that so I could get you off my back.
I do?<eos> If it's that crazy chauffeur girl...<eos> Don't say anything.<eos> Just listen.<eos> I only came down here to explain to you that my chef took my car without my permission, and she picked you up from the airport without my knowledge.
If it's that crazy chauffeur girl...<eos> Don't say anything.<eos> Just listen.<eos> I only came down here to explain to you that my chef took my car without my permission, and she picked you up from the airport without my knowledge.<eos> I am extremely sorry that she inadvertently ran you over... twice... and I will pay for your hospital stay, but that's it.
-No, you're mistaken.<eos> I can see cat blood all over the wall!<eos> That was there before.<eos> The wall covered in cat blood was there before?<eos> Can I help you with something, Kenny?
[Michael] ♪ Oh, baby ♪<eos> Okay, those baby-making numbers are coming along nicely, but we need 75,000, so keep at it, everybody.<eos> Do you want to disappoint Santa?<eos> Okay, then get out there, find a woman and impregnate her.<eos> Okay, love you, too, Dad.
-I have a forked tongue, like a snake.<eos> [muffled shouts] -Son of a...<eos> -No!<eos> No! No!<eos> Oh, I love you, too.
What the hell do I have to do?<eos> Kill the Black Fairy.<eos> Did she harm you?<eos> She toughened me up.<eos> What did she do to you?
If you want a favor in return, I'd be happy to oblige.<eos> Well, as luck would have it, I do need a favor... a magic bean, to be exact.<eos> You got one for me before, and I'm willing to bet that you have another one.<eos> And in return, that sorry lot of cheap jewelry you probably stole from some wench?<eos> I assure you, those are some of the finest jewels Agrabah has to offer.
Seemed like a... good plan at the time.<eos> In retrospect, perhaps not.<eos> I thought I could channel your powers via the sword to open a portal between worlds.<eos> I'm sorry, Emma.<eos> After everything I've done to you, you should just walk away.
It's a dead end.<eos> What the hell are you doing? !<eos> I already told you.<eos> Once you're dead, I'll be able to channel your powers and use this sword to open a portal to a realm.<eos> I was helping you.
You were a gift... my loyal son.<eos> Gift?<eos> You stole me from my parents.<eos> They abandoned you!<eos> I'm the one who took you in, gave you a home, taught you, fed you, shared with you everything that I had!
I don't have a choice.<eos> He's tried to kill me twice.<eos> I'm not gonna give him a third chance.<eos> All right, Savior.<eos> If you cross my son, I will do what I must to stop you.
But it's the right thing to do.<eos> You have to have faith that it'll...<eos> How can you ask me to have faith after what happened to Doug?<eos> Listen to me.<eos> The same God that has called you to teach... to change these children's lives... has called me to serve my country.
You're putting up your own building, huh?<eos> Your own structure?<eos> I mean, not 45 stories of brick and mortar and glass and steel, but I see it, story by story.<eos> And you wanna know something?<eos> You know I'm the only one who can stop you from getting to your rooftop.
All right, you stupid mermaid.<eos> Go ahead and eat, man.<eos> So you, um, you live with Smurf?<eos> Ever since my mom died.<eos> And she took you in?
The way he was, laying in his bed, babbling' bullshit all day long?<eos> That ever happens to me, you put a bullet in my head.<eos> Okay.<eos> Swear!<eos> Say, "Grandma, that ever happens to you", I'll put the bullet in your head."
Cards are risky.<eos> You've never had a problem with credit cards before.<eos> What are you talkin' about?<eos> What's the issue here? What am I missing?<eos> Smurf told you not to work with us, didn't she?
You want me to do what?<eos> - No.<eos> - Rufus...<eos> Wyatt, I can't do that.<eos> I'm not helping you... kill someone else.
I'm good, I'm good!<eos> I'm good.<eos> I'm good.<eos> ♪ Remember that rainy evening?<eos> ♪ I sent you out ♪
In what language?<eos> Well, Devon, I guess I'm rotating the orchids alone.<eos> Dave?<eos> Where's Eddie?<eos> He hired me to take care of all this stuff with you.
Don't worry. I have an amazing work ethic from raising myself.<eos> Chris Mullin got a cup?<eos> I can't believe you ditched me!<eos> That's it.<eos> From now on, I forbid you from going out on your own!
Oh, good!<eos> I get a chance to use my new mail-sorting system.<eos> Mommy, I'd like to try out for the school debate team.<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> It'll take time away from your schoolwork, they'll charge us for additional supplies, and I'm not driving all over town to take you to debate tournaments.
Let's see how she supports it.<eos> Think of other brilliant young prodigies througut history...<eos> Mozart, Joan of Arc, Doogie Howser.<eos> What if someone had told them that they were too young to practice their extraordinary gift?<eos> Little girl... what if someone had prevented you from following your dream?
Actually, I'm a business major.<eos> Oh.<eos> - So am I.<eos> - Oh, yeah?<eos> I'm surprised I haven't seen you around the business library.
Look, I know you're heading out into the world, and you need to look professional, so... I'm gonna buy you a suit.<eos> Hmm. We gonna hit a garage sale?<eos> Nope.<eos> We're going to a real suit store.<eos> I am taking you to The Suit Plantation.
You good?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Are you sure? Mm-hmm.<eos> Hey, um... any more on Kai Chen?<eos> Gibbs told you not to get involved.
- It was informative.<eos> Intel suggests Chen might be on a yacht in the Aegean, off the coast of Greece.<eos> They have a boat under surveillance.<eos> It's hopeful.<eos> If Gibbs finds out you're working on this and I'm helping you, he'll kill us both.
No. Not-not now.<eos> Just... get going.<eos> Please.<eos> Okay. I love you.<eos> I love you, too.
So, is your client guilty?<eos> It's not as simple as that.<eos> - Sure it is.<eos> - What I get, Roger, is that you're an LAPD cop who bleeds LAPD blue.<eos> And I love you for that.
I'm not killing you.<eos> Sins of the past.<eos> Let me introduce Peter Scarelli.<eos> Do you remember Captain Avery here?<eos> He's the man who framed you for murder.
I'm happy to help.<eos> So, what does this have to do with me?<eos> The body is one of your former recruits.<eos> Do you recognize this man?<eos> Alex, she lied to you, kicked your ass, and left you for dead, and that's just today.
So, what does this have to do with me?<eos> The body is one of your former recruits.<eos> Do you recognize this man?<eos> Alex, she lied to you, kicked your ass, and left you for dead, and that's just today.<eos> Not to mention what she did to you at The Farm.
Yes?<eos> Good. More shots of your mediocre liquor, sir.<eos> I'll be back.<eos> Hey, I'm out with everyone right now.<eos> I'm not supposed to be calling you or even talking to you, but I thought that you deserved to know.
I'm not going anywhere.<eos> I know.<eos> But maybe drifting apart was right for us.<eos> Well, like you asking for this ring back.<eos> I was just trying to reach you, shake you out of your paranoia that turned out to be horribly prophetic.
Then don't come.<eos> Whatever.<eos> I got shit to do.<eos> You sure?<eos> Yeah. Come on, I'll go call you an Uber.
Oh, you are?<eos> Well, then tell her thanks for changing the security codes on me, and I want my goddamn tools from the warehouse.<eos> Tell her that.<eos> You know, Lena's been having nightmares.<eos> - Did she ask you to tell me that, too?
Did I mess up?<eos> No.<eos> I-I love Mexican.<eos> When I told you about my son.<eos> I hope that didn't scare you off.
- Oh, doing what?<eos> I've been breaking horses for 25 years.<eos> What's one little girl?<eos> Bye, my sweet girl.<eos> I love you infinity times infinity.
Thank you, though. Bye, honey!<eos> Bye, Mom!<eos> Mom! Mommy, wait!<eos> Yeah, baby?<eos> I made something for you so every time you look at it you remember me.
Gun takes a little getting used to.<eos> Not that it isn't sexy, just slightly emasculating.<eos> You're the man, I'm just a secretary with a badge.<eos> You are a Senior Special Agent with the FBI, and that is a hell of a lot more than a secretary.<eos> At least they moved you to D.C. They can't keep you behind a desk forever.
- Alone? - Yeah.<eos> That doesn't seem right.<eos> I hate leaving him here.<eos> Look, I'll fly home as soon as I can, okay?<eos> You fly home with Kevin, just see if Dobbs can go with you.
Head down, go!<eos> - I don't know, a belt? - Make a tourniquet.<eos> - I can't feel it.<eos> - That's the shock.<eos> I'm gonna get you someplace safe.
MIC WORKING:<eos> Hello? Hello? Hello?<eos> Testing... # You were working as a waitress in a cocktail bar<eos> # When I met yo-ou<eos> # I picked you out and shook you up and turned you around
Right, who's next?<eos> Me!<eos> It's my party and I want some rock!<eos> I'll... I'll get some more beer.<eos> Let me help you with that, Rog... No...
Maybe you should give her her notice as well?<eos> Give her a fresh start.<eos> That's what she deserves.<eos> Yeah, I think you're right.<eos> Can I help you, Janet?
We'll mount a full-scale attack on the castle and free the people.<eos> Then, I'll be a hero.<eos> [high voice] "Oh, Lance, you're so handsome!" [normal voice] "And modest."<eos> [high voice] "Oh, thank you for saving us.<eos> Can I kiss you?"
Remember what happened at Zarkon's command center.<eos> Still working on the worm-- [screams] [groans, screams]<eos> The turbine's up.<eos> Uh, guys, I think I'm realizing now that I do, in fact, have a case of the slipperies.<eos> I'm sorry I yelled at you, Pidge.
In full Paladin armor, with a bag of your belongings?<eos> I have to know if Zarkon is tracking me.<eos> This is the only way.<eos> Don't try to stop me.<eos> I'm not going to stop you.
Umvy spice, by-tor water, little bottles of infinity vapor.<eos> Of course, you had to bargain. No one could bargain like the Unilu.<eos> Last time, I ended up giving away three quarters of my shipment of lango... in exchange for a used pogo oscillator.<eos> Father was not pleased about that.<eos> Well, while Coran is picking up his lenses... I'll take you shopping for something sparkly.
I knew they looked edgy.<eos> Varkon's comin' for ya!<eos> [Shiro] So this was Zarkon's home planet.<eos> Show me more.<eos> [Shiro] King Alford built you from that comet.
Well, I did have a good teacher.<eos> So, how about returning the favor and coming out on a case with us?<eos> You know my weapon of choice is a computer.<eos> You sure that has nothing to do with the fact that you hate to fly?<eos> Mae told you, di...
- Do you want to try one?<eos> No, thanks.<eos> - Hmm! - Thank you.<eos> - You're welcome.<eos> - Hi. Can I help you?
Because he gets to live next door to you.<eos> - Uh... go, go, go, go, go! - What?<eos> - It's Martha and Tom.<eos> - They're coming this way.<eos> - Did they see you?
I won't be needing an extra salesgirl, either.<eos> It's okay.<eos> This was fun while it lasted, but I'd like a job where I have more time to talk with the customers.<eos> So, that's a difference between you and me.<eos> Oh, Mom. I was just about to call you and ask you for a ride.
- Maybe I'll check it out.<eos> - I hope to see you there.<eos> I stopped by to see when I'll be getting my invitation to display<eos> - my crystals at the Healthfest.<eos> - And I was hoping to invite you again but I'm not sure there's going to be room this year.
I got to clean up their mess.<eos> No, you can go ahead and eat without me.<eos> I... I'll find something here.<eos> All right.<eos> Okay. I love you, too.
I'm starting to forget things about her.<eos> Little things.<eos> God knows I don't want to, but, um...<eos> I am and... I can't do anything about it.<eos> So let us help you through it.
Ooh! Not yet!<eos> And now, we're ready.<eos> Surprise!<eos> Fifty square feet of living space, a lovely fake kitchen, and a window overlooking an air shaft.<eos> But the best part, rent is only a daily "I love you, Daddy."

I'm already an hour late for wrestling practice. Oh!<eos> Guys, don't forget, my big match is tonight.<eos> I lose, but you won't see it coming.<eos> Oh! Hey.<eos> Hey, honey, I just came by to stop you.
Mmm, pretty sure someone who has feelings for me wouldn't accidentally call me "Bill."<eos> And yet, you seem oddly obsessed with her.<eos> I'm not obsessed. If I see her again, great, if I don't, whatever.<eos> Oh, good!<eos> Because if I was her, and I was, uh, I predict she's about to go radio silent, totally unavailable, now you're the one chasing her, and that's when she reels you in like a fish.
Whoa. That hurt more than I thought it would.<eos> That's because Ryan is trying to destroy your career.<eos> He blames you for not making the team.<eos> Why?<eos> Because your mother, who loves you very much... Aah! ...seduced Ryan the last night of training camp to make sure that you made the team.
Dude! That really hurts!<eos> Just tryin' to make it look real.<eos> Hey, you gotta believe me, I had no idea she sabotaged your chances of becoming a Ranger.<eos> - What are you talkin' about?<eos> - That woman who seduced you the last night at camp, she did it on purpose.
Don't cry, Mom, I'm ok.<eos> I'm ok.<eos> Everything is gonna be ok.<eos> I love you...<eos> I love you so much.
If you come anywhere near her with those, I will kill you myself.<eos> She's dying, Lord Bothwell.<eos> The queen wants me to save her child.<eos> Greer... Greer, I love you.<eos> I love you, too.
I'm gonna go.<eos> This is from my source.<eos> He's given me coordinates on the dead drop.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Who sent you?
There's no way out, Nigel.<eos> Turn yourself in.<eos> You know I'm not gonna do that.<eos> Are you sure about that?<eos> 'Cause we've got a nice, eight by ten supermax cell ready for you.
You lied to me.<eos> You betrayed me.<eos> You... you destroyed me.<eos> You have to know.<eos> I am sorry I did this to you.
- Yeah.<eos> Yeah, it's just a work thing.<eos> You should probably get to it.<eos> Good night.<eos> I like you... a lot.
They could kill us if we try to escape.<eos> Or we do escape, and then we freeze to death in the middle-of-nowhere Vermont!<eos> Maybe we should just...<eos> How the hell do you know where we are?<eos> Did Shepherd send you to me?
A monster.<eos> You're not that person anymore.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> Because I watched Jane go through exactly what you're going through right now.<eos> I've seen you with my team.
Any version of it will end up with me suspending you, so here's what's gonna happen.<eos> You're gonna put in for some time off.<eos> Vacation, leave of absence.<eos> Whatever you want, I'll approve it.<eos> But, Edgar, whatever it is that you're going through, we can help you, but you need to...
Now, listen, man, remember, the only thing you gotta do is get your CFO to make that wire transfer, and we all go home.<eos> But if you try and escape, yell for help,<eos> Darren's gonna open fire in that building.<eos> If you try to be a hero, my colleagues are gonna slit your girlfriend's pretty little throat.<eos> - You understand what I'm saying to you?
I didn't wear the right shoes for this!<eos> Go over there!<eos> I'm sorry about before.<eos> I guess I really freaked out on you.<eos> And I'm sorry that I told you I was gonna shave your eyebrows off in your sleep.
And I just disagreed with them, completely.<eos> How is it possibly legal that a company makes millions of dollars every year helping pimps sell human sex trafficking victims, including children.<eos> Why would Congress ever grant immunity to a company that engages in conduct like this?<eos> And he said, "Let's do this.<eos> Let's stop Backpage for what they've done to you."
- Find a point?<eos> You ever been that dark?<eos> I wanna be with you.<eos> I love you.<eos> I think I might love you, too.
I liked her a lot.<eos> I'm really sorry.<eos> Don't be.<eos> There's a guard on the second floor working with us.<eos> He'll escort you to a corner where a cab will be waiting.
The dead sleep with their eyes open, my grandfather would say.<eos> They're watching you from the past...
I have to go.<eos> Everything okay?<eos> - Not now.<eos> - See you tonight?<eos> I'll call you when I'm done.
I have provided you with an opportunity.<eos> Now, you have said before, that this is your endgame.<eos> And now, your goal is within spitting distance and all you see is betrayal?<eos> I don't buy it.<eos> Stop talking about what I've done to you.
All right.<eos> I want you to know I'm here if you need... any advice on policy or... anything else you might need.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm going to bed.<eos> No one will ever love you as much as I do.
How did we get here, Francis?<eos> Oh, let it go.<eos> It's done.<eos> Oh, and one word of advice.<eos> Whomever Usher offers up to you as vice president, that's the person that you're really gonna have to watch.
♪ Nothing's gonna stop you-- ♪<eos> [Deirdre] Jacqueline?<eos> I didn't know you had a sister.<eos> -[Deirdre gasps] -Deirdre!<eos> I haven't seen you since since Reg was named Transportation Secretary.
I'm just upset.<eos> No, see, right there, you knew you hurt my feelings.<eos> And I'm proud of you-- for reasons I'm sure have something to do with my father.<eos> And if you don't like that machine, get rid of it.<eos> Because I love you exactly the way you are.
Oh, yeah.<eos> Without question. Little before, actually.<eos> Oh, wow. Don't let him get away.<eos> Wait.<eos> What did she say? Uh, basically, she traded you for Bruce Wayne.
You have no idea what's out there for me.<eos> You can't stop us.<eos> You don't have magic in this world.<eos> Here, you're just a man.<eos> I don't need magic to stop you.
I'm sorry, Mom, I...<eos> I have to go. I...<eos> Lucy.<eos> Hold on.<eos> I know meeting your father has thrown you, and I get it that you don't want to talk to me about it, but what do we do in our family when we go through tough times?
It certainly did 'cause now I have...<eos> You know, when I'm in speaking situations, so often, people are in the audience, and, um, it is very touching to me because again and again, you get stories like the ones you're telling now of people who've lost so much<eos> I mean, it cleared the way for us to do this show, so...<eos> Well, thank you. ...<eos> I applaud you for what you've done.
You know, I get that exploiting other people for their fame is a thing, but couldn't you have at least asked me first?<eos> Whoa, whoa... Who's exploiting you?<eos> You posted stuff that was private.<eos> It was just between us.<eos> I'm trying to help you, Major.
Yeah, I guess I am making decent money.<eos> You make more than I do.<eos> You may not have a house yet, but your apartment's great.<eos> It's bigger than mine.<eos> And Leonard loves you so much, he married you twice.
And he's, like, "Yeah, you're right, I didn't."<eos> Which is a horrible thing to hear, but it also felt good.<eos> Because my whole life, I felt like I was insane.<eos> I'd say to people, "I don't think my dad loves me."<eos> They'd be, like, "Of course your dad loves you."
-It's--<eos> -But it's not you.<eos> It's me.<eos> My anger has blinded me for too long.<eos> I'm so sorry I misjudged you.
Let's be in the moment.<eos> Stop!<eos> Stop!<eos> Nah, nah, no more orders from you, little man.<eos> Maybe we can't get to you, but we can get to your friend.
Oh!<eos> Please don't shoot.<eos> Oh, honey.<eos> I'm not gonna shoot you.<eos> The gun is just to make sure you stay quiet while Charlotte strangles you.
You know what, Titus?<eos> I meant it when I said I only wanted good people in my bunker.<eos> You mean "funker."<eos> I don't anymore.<eos> And even with all the extra chances I've given you, I'm not sure you're a good person.
I get that you're pissed but... there's more.<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> I told you I would find him.<eos> I told you to talk to me about this fucking guy.<eos> Isn't that the first thing I said to you?
She just got brought home by the cops.<eos> I think she needs to be with her friends right now.<eos> Do you not see what's going on here?<eos> She's worried and she's trying to help.<eos> Whatever possessed you to bring up your dad's suicide the other night... with all that's going on.
But I guess you don't care about ripping into other people's lives. Is that it?<eos> Just because we live in a small town, doesn't mean we don't try to solve a murder.<eos> Okay, Annie. Listen. People do weird things.<eos> Suspicious things. Including you.<eos> A lunatic who claimed he knew something about Jesse reached out to you and you lied.
They got the better of me.<eos> I don't want her to become me either.<eos> I just wanna take care of my kid.<eos> We are taking care of our kid.<eos> What's going on with you?
I didn't need that in my life.<eos> Okay? Just start the truck, please.<eos> Carefully.<eos> Okay.<eos> I love you, bro.
I'm not worried about getting a ticket.<eos> Dude, if I go any slower, inertia is not gonna be on our side, and these bumps are gonna get a whole lot worse, and you know what that means, okay?<eos> If I don't maintain this speed, we're not gonna make it to the clearing in time.<eos> How we doing on bars?<eos> Do you not think that if I had bars I would inform you of that, huh?
Wh-What do you mean by that?<eos> What do I mean by that?<eos> You didn't feel the need to include me in your decision to retire.<eos> It's my retirement.<eos> Why would I include you in something like that?
Plus, I got some of the blue liquid they put combs in.<eos> Its active ingredient is alkyldimethylbenzylammonium chloride.<eos> Thought we could do some experiments.<eos> Sweet.<eos> Paige, how's the new do affecting you?
- The nearest open window.<eos> Any luck?<eos> You asked me that five minutes ago.<eos> You know, it's not easy trying to get a 21st century radio to communicate with a 22nd century time ship.<eos> Thawne never told you what he did with Rip?
Grey!<eos> Come on, Grey.<eos> Come on, come on.<eos> Ahh! Let him go, Mick.<eos> I'm not listening to you anymore.
Sara, it needs you.<eos> Even if doing the right thing... means not having you back?<eos> I'm never too far away.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too.
Should've done this in France, Mick.<eos> Could've saved us both a lot of time.<eos> I didn't bring you here to kill you, Leonard.<eos> So what are we doing here?<eos> This is where Thawne recruited you for the Legion.
The Legion's been put back in their proper places in the timeline, so... now it's my turn.<eos> Okay, um... Well, if you don't mind, I'd like to get off<eos> - at that stop with you.<eos> - What?<eos> Look, I lost you once already, even though it was a different me and a different you.
I mean, my... my hero.<eos> All I wanted to do was to make you proud.<eos> Right now, it's like that moment where... where Dorothy pulls back the curtain, and she sees the Wizard for who he truly is:<eos> A coward.<eos> Do you really think that this, um, childish, plucky snark is going to help you?
- Yeah. It was... - Oh, my God.<eos> - .. totally uncool. It just makes me angry hearing about it.<eos> Yeah, and then my boss blames me for handing out too many business cards<eos> - which is ridiculous, because why have them?<eos> - Yeah. Your boss sounds like an arsehole if he fired you for that.
- Good.<eos> - And... I've got some serious shit too, Sam.<eos> - I really do.<eos> - You do.<eos> Yeah, you do. And I want to help you out with that, so think of me as your guru.
- I thought she was great, actually.<eos> Yeah, you made that clear too, Greg.<eos> Just go easy on her, May.<eos> You're all she's got, you know.<eos> She's flown out here because she loves you.
What's that douche so happy about?<eos> - Dyl! - Oh, my God!<eos> Look at your threads!<eos> Nice hiding place.<eos> I'm really sorry I hit you, Dyl.
- He... - Dylan is in a lot of pain.<eos> So you need to be good friends and give him the time you can.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I know, I know, I know.<eos> - How did they even find you?
- just hurry up.<eos> - OK, OK. Thank you.<eos> Seriously!<eos> You're choosing this shit over me, Dyl?<eos> - I'm forgiving you.
Sight for sore eyes.<eos> How are you?<eos> Take a seat.<eos> Morning, May.<eos> I'm sorry about yesterday, and for just surprising you like that.
We'll be fine, don't worry.<eos> What's that?<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - The British Embassy released you.<eos> Yes, I love you, Britain, I told you.
I actually haven't seen that movie.<eos> You've not seen the film that inspired my un-started original screenplay<eos> The Bodyguard 2: Guard Her Harder?<eos> Maybe we can watch it together sometime.<eos> Listen, um, I'd invite you in, but there's something I got to tell you.
She's a professor of her-story with a focus on the Viet-ma'am war.<eos> Let me find her.<eos> Dianne?<eos> My partner and equal!<eos> [Kimmy] Perry, I am so, so sorry about hucking that trash can at you.
She's usually right about these things.<eos> Now, come on.<eos> Leave this here.<eos> You can come back for it all later.<eos> Regina! Hi. What, - what can I help you with?
You don't have to pretend anymore.<eos> Pretend what?<eos> That you'd rather be doing something else.<eos> All right, stanum, tell me...<eos> Why am I out here helping you?
You should have taken me up on my offer when you had the chance.<eos> Why?<eos> Don't you know?<eos> Wicked always wins.<eos> And now I'm going to end you once and for all.
And here I thought lions were supposed to be brave.<eos> Coward.<eos> You saved me.<eos> You're lucky I did.<eos> What's happening to you?
You don't need a time-travel spell so you won't be alone.<eos> You just need some friends.<eos> Let me guess...<eos> like you? Do you actually think I would give up my magic to save you?<eos> So you could have a friend that would accept you when no one else did?
Gold.<eos> Gold's got her in the back of his shop.<eos> I-I'm not not proud of what I did, but I did what I thought was best for myself.<eos> We both did.<eos> What are you doing here? We're here to help you.
Don't worry.<eos> Your Wyatt's fine.<eos> And I take it Rufus has recovered too.<eos> I just wanted you to know when I destroy Rittenhouse tonight... and I will... that also includes your grandfather,<eos> Ethan Cahill, which means... honestly, I'm not sure what's going to happen to you, but whatever it is, it's probably not good.
What do you want from me?<eos> My blessing?<eos> I don't want anything from you.<eos> You don't want anything from me?<eos> I think deep down there's some part... some human part of you that wants me to stop you.
I used to.<eos> But now I just think that you're sad, and you're lonely.<eos> I think you're a broken person... who misses the people that they love, just like me, just like Wyatt.<eos> Don't talk about my family like you know them.<eos> You want to stop Rittenhouse, we'll help you.
I've got about $50.<eos> We don't want any money.<eos> We need you to take us to the Rittenhouse summit.<eos> So you're the one always begging to time travel.<eos> How's it working out for you?
We have to stop trying to fix the past, and focus on the present.<eos> I need you to hear me out.<eos> I know what to do now.<eos> Please, before it's too late.<eos> The journal... didn't it say that I was going to help you one day?
in its entirety, got it?<eos> Hey, Rufus, back in '54, um... I couldn't open my eyes, but I heard everything you said.<eos> What did I say?<eos> I've been waiting 60 years to tell you.<eos> I love you too.
- That's how it works. - Yeah.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you for everything.<eos> We'll stay in touch.<eos> I'll call you if I ever need a bossy know-it-all.
[yelps] [Drench] ...hurricane. She's expected to make landfall anytime in the next 12 hours and promises to be as horrible as that spelling of Tammi.<eos> With air temps hovering right around freezing...<eos> Okay, nerd, let's get something straight.<eos> I need your help, but I am not your friend.<eos> I will not be making you over for a dance, and if you take your glasses off, I will not be all, "Wait.
I've got to warn people that he's just a liar with amazing teeth.<eos> [Lillian] Ooh. Turn on the news. That's where all the old-people commercials are.<eos> My likeness and my mouthness were stolen by a drug company.<eos> They turned me into a bladder.<eos> Brother, you're always thinking that people are ripping you off.
You'll get used to it.<eos> Especially once we get you some new clothes.<eos> Yeah, the doctor said I could shop at regular clothing stores now.<eos> You know I don't care what you look like, right?<eos> I'm just happy to have you back. It's the two of us now.
I know. Because my brothers...<eos> No, I mean, that kid in the attic is a big part of who you are, and I don't want to lose him.<eos> I do.<eos> I was in the attic because I was hiding from my family.<eos> I know. They tormented you.
Mr. Goodman, say something only an alive person would say.<eos> Okay, uh... you know you're in a golden age of television when you take a show like The Americans for granted.<eos> My God, Artie.<eos> You didn't have a pulse.<eos> Ah, look, I didn't want to worry you, but I have an LVAD machine in my heart.
It's all right.<eos> - It's Jersey.<eos> It's Jersey. - Yeah.<eos> Listen, man, it's-it's, um... it's-it's really great to meet you.<eos> I just want you to know I saw you in the Garden. 1988.
Fine.<eos> I'm still gonna worry, all right?<eos> So, please, just do this for me.<eos> Come on.<eos> If I'd known that you were such a good cook, I would've asked you over a long time ago.
- Good.<eos> Now that you know I'm safe, you can leave.<eos> We haven't spoken for weeks, and that's all you have to say to me?<eos> There's nothing left to say.<eos> Look... all I wanted was to hear your voice. If something had happened to you...
My vote is "yes," and I'm not sorry.<eos> Why is it every time a Muslim kills someone in this country, he's a terrorist, but, you know, if a white man does it, he's simply disturbed?<eos> Save that claptrap for your buddies in the lamestream media.<eos> My vote's "yes," and it's rock-solid.<eos> Your mother should know better than sending you in here like this.
But you act first.<eos> If I'm gonna make it out of here alive,<eos> I need to learn to do the same.<eos> And I think maybe you're the one to teach me.<eos> Me help you?
That's wonderful!<eos> Yes, that is wonderful!<eos> You will no longer be able to accuse me of being spoiled!<eos> I am so proud of you.<eos> Dad, I'm trying to tell you off, and you're ruining it with your delight and relief.
Oh, no, my grown son is going to stop spending all my money.<eos> Where did I fail as a father? !<eos> Yeah, that's right.<eos> Keep asking yourself that!<eos> But I still love you very much, so don't cut me out of the will.
He's right.<eos> And I'm sorry for the part I played in this.<eos> Thank you, Bert.<eos> You're a good man.<eos> That woman who stood you up and humiliated you last night really missed out.
I'll give you your trial run.<eos> It's what Julia Roberts would do.<eos> All right!<eos> - Bye, Grandma.<eos> - Oh, I love you so much.
And make 'em start on their homework right away, or they'll just run around like maniacs.<eos> Basically, they're maniacs.<eos> And I can't believe I have to say this, but no weapons and no explosives.<eos> Relax.<eos> We raised you, and you turned out fantastic.
No, we have to figure out who's loyal to you.<eos> Well... I guess the easy answer is Siefert.<eos> I mean, he did bring me back for that last season.<eos> Then again, he also unceremoniously cut me.<eos> Then again, he hired you to ride his hip in front office.
About Vegas, Mark.<eos> Jesus, I flew all the way out here 'cause you told me you'd give me the inside shit.<eos> Spence, I'll be honest, I can't risk it.<eos> This TV gig, it's... It's too important to me.<eos> Did they tell you not to talk to me? They did, didn't they?
Wife's on you about the hours?<eos> No, I guess I'm just a little bit gun shy after I heard what you said to Jay Glazer on TV.<eos> Oh, sometimes I gotta put a spin on things to keep the media and the fans on our side.<eos> Yeah, but you took sole credit for Anthony Sutton.<eos> I'm the one who sent you down there, signed off on bringing him in and training him up.
Hard job to do, harder still to let go.<eos> How about that?<eos> You should listen to this guy.<eos> He knows what he's talking about.<eos> He put you up to saying that.
Yeah.<eos> All right.<eos> You all right?<eos> Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> Um, despite, uh, the little voice in my head that is constantly telling me to never listen to you, I ignored it, and I went and I called Stan.
She has Gideon's heart.<eos> I've already lost one son, Belle.<eos> I can't lose another.<eos> And you won't... not as long as his mother's drawing breath.<eos> He's so lucky to have you.
There is something here of use.<eos> The one thing she's afraid of...<eos> You learning her darkest secret.<eos> And what is that?<eos> The reason she gave you up.
I don't know what I know... but I know I must do this.<eos> Let me help you.<eos> I can...<eos> No.<eos> I've put you in enough danger.
The last thing you and I need is another stitch of bad luck.<eos> After tomorrow, there'll be no getting rid of me.<eos> - Promise?<eos> - Aye.<eos> So... did they trust you?
but I gave it to someone else.<eos> Did you hear that, Mom?<eos> I should have won the scholarship.<eos> Me.<eos> Not the other guy, but... I could have got a degree, better job, and... I could have taken you to Hawaii like you always dreamed about.
Would you like to rip some hand towels in half, sweetie?<eos> No.<eos> Okay, no judgment.<eos> Look, the best thing for us to do is to be strong and help her rest and relax.<eos> Is there anything I can do to help you?
Standing by.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You were in a cell just a day ago.<eos> This must be surreal for you.<eos> Not as surreal as having you as my partner.
And right here, right now, your AV system is completely corrupted.<eos> We'll send you our proposal.<eos> - See you later.<eos> - Get in the elevator, take it to the next floor down, take the stairs to the fire exit.<eos> They'll have security waiting for you in the lobby.
He has lockers like this all around the globe.<eos> You want me to hack it so you can steal from Mr. Reddington.<eos> No.<eos> I'm not gonna do that.<eos> I did not bring you here to steal from Raymond.
You want me to hack it so you can steal from Mr. Reddington.<eos> No.<eos> I'm not gonna do that.<eos> I did not bring you here to steal from Raymond.<eos> I brought you here to find out who already did.
Over there.<eos> The folder.<eos> It's a full dossier on Fickman.<eos> His movements, past addresses.<eos> Who hired you to kill him?
Hate to leave this on your machine, but there's something you ought to know.<eos> Your friends, uhm...<eos> the black fella and the man in the hat,<eos> Reddington-- they're here.<eos> You said they'd kill me to get you, if this is the last time you hear my voice, know that I didn't give you up.
What will we eat?<eos> We're gonna eat what we catch.<eos> I'm bringing the fishing poles with us.<eos> What if we don't catch aything?<eos> RJ, your father is taking you to the woods to impart wisdom.?
Actually, the place is a mess.<eos> And you didn't call, so...<eos> How many times you come by my house uninvited?<eos> Well, that's because your lovely wife extended an open invitation.<eos> Unfortunately, I have not offered that to you.
You said so yourself.<eos> They were listening to you.<eos> Hey, baby.<eos> Got to finish a couple of things at work, and then I'll be home.<eos> Okay, we'll wait for you, then.
Look at you.<eos> Someone's been doing Pilates.<eos> Detective Riggs.<eos> I thought I might hear from you.<eos> If I wanted to blow you up, you'd be confetti by now.
Even if it means literally burning up your past.<eos> How do you cope?<eos> I talk to Michelle.<eos> She hears it all.<eos> Nothing beats having someone to listen to you who gets it.
It's charming and endearing, it's sense memory.<eos> You cannot resist my Arnold.<eos> Federal agents!<eos> Stop!<eos> I'm sending a couple of photos to you, Dave.
Well, there are other worlds out there.<eos> My future's in amarillo.<eos> A lot of people sing about amarillo, you know.<eos> George strait, Neil sedaka, rob zombie.<eos> Is that what's leading you there?
Why would Adam schedule a meeting on a Saturday?<eos> Where'd you hear that?<eos> From Don.<eos> Well, Adam said the reason they couldn't go is 'cause Don messed up a client's floors and they had to fix them.<eos> That's what he told you?
- Rumspringa.<eos> - Boy ride.<eos> Rumspringa is a hallowed Amish tradition, not a one-day buddy comedy.<eos> Second of all, I don't want to go to a casino or a sexual petting zoo.<eos> That is why we are taking you to the old-timey Danish town oddly located in California's wine country.
Son of a...<eos> Look, there.<eos> I got the bird.<eos> Isn't this fun?<eos> I told you I didn't want a Rumspringa.
It'd be wrong for me to take away a piece of his heart.<eos> I mean, I already took away his testicles.<eos> Anyway, let me just... _<eos> Proud of you.<eos> You won't need the key I gave you.
The CIA values brains over body, but the FBI knows that a stronger body makes for a stronger mind.<eos> Tread.<eos> Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.<eos> If you were a Navy SEAL, I'd be shooting rubber bullets at you.<eos> - What does that teach you?
I haven't touch a thing since you left, so go.<eos> Rummage through the place, see for yourself who I am.<eos> No, I don't need to do that.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> I like you, too, okay?
I didn't kill anyone.<eos> But I think that you and I have been doing the same thing...<eos> Trying to find out who Carly was working for before she died.<eos> All right, so that's why you broke in, to see if we're on the same side?<eos> I had to be sure before I approached you, so I started following you.
Some day, I may have to.<eos> I know, but you haven't yet.<eos> I'm gonna start tomorrow.<eos> Shut up.<eos> Alex Parrish, if we're being honest with each other, I never really liked you...
I have to run down a lead.<eos> A lead?<eos> On me and my team?<eos> I know you think I'm an adversary, but I'm on your side.<eos> I think I found something that could help you.
After you told me about it, I started thinking.<eos> We need to be careful.<eos> Sandstorm feels like it's everywhere.<eos> Shepherd's been watching me since I was a kid.<eos> They used you against me.
Yeah?<eos> I think I kind of like him.<eos> Well, just play it cool.<eos> You don't want to come on too strong.<eos> You know what I said to you this morning
You put me in charge of your finances.<eos> If you wanted someone weak and spineless you could walk all over, you should have asked Leonard.<eos> See? Miserable.<eos> Okay, you're right, I got myself into this, but I've never missed a Comic-Con with you guys.<eos> Your father may have spoiled you, but I won't.
There's got to be other ways you can make a quick buck.<eos> Yeah, you'd think.<eos> Ooh, maybe I could sell my blood and sperm.<eos> I really should wear a bell around my neck so you guys can hear me coming.<eos> Here, let me help you.
Have they made any progress?<eos> They're pouring everything they have into locating her.<eos> And now that you remember that big detail that the other person in the room was a woman...<eos> I might remember more.<eos> I know how hard this is, but our best hope is exonerating you before a verdict.
"Wedding To-Do List"?<eos> It's long. Yup.<eos> That's 'cause big weddings are stupid time-sucks which we will look back upon one day and realize was worth all the hard work.<eos> Nice save.<eos> Well, I can help you with it if you want.
Hi.<eos> I'm Happy Quinn.<eos> We've obviously never met.<eos> I'm serious.<eos> There's a lot on that list that has to be done and you need someone to assist you.
You're being weird about this.<eos> I am not being weird about the maid of honor thing, I'm being weird because, I don't know, I just thought maybe we'd grown close over the past couple years.<eos> What?<eos> We're-We're friends-ish.<eos> I like you just fine.
That's not what I meant by the "cheerleader" comment.<eos> Okay, so what did you mean?<eos> Toby wants to invite half of Brooklyn to the ceremony.<eos> He says he wants to show me off.<eos> He's proud he's marrying you.
Go, Brazil!<eos> Oh, look at that.<eos> You've gotta get to that center.<eos> The more you hang on that outside... the more you risk getting thrown off.<eos> I think Bruno just heard you, Terry, because he seems to be following your advice.
He has been through a lot of stuff.<eos> That fact he's here when doctors told him he couldn't walk again...<eos> If there's ever a guy that can overcome some physical pain, it's Ken Corigliano.<eos> Ken!<eos> We love you, Ken!
You know?<eos> Like, yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> And then I would say, "I made that bed."<eos> And they would be like, "We love you now." And I'm like...
And every time she saw the cookies, she would hide from them.<eos> I'd say, "Mom, they're not trying to deport you.<eos> They're selling cookies."<eos> "Ah, that's what you think!<eos> Oh-ho-ho!" "That's how they get you!
- Never said it.<eos> - Maybe I imagined it?<eos> That's possibility number three.<eos> Number one is that Stinger said it to you from the hijacked signal.<eos> - What's number two? - That the days you were trapped in the stitch affected you.
You know?<eos> I'm working outside. Pay's decent.<eos> And at the end of the day, I get to come home to my beautiful "Smokeshow" of a wife.<eos> Excuse me, what now?<eos> "Smokeshow." That's what the guys on the crew call you.
"You didn't do anything.<eos> It's Sheldon."<eos> That'd make a nice needlepoint pillow.<eos> So, relax.<eos> We're happy to have you.
Yes, you're fine as long as you have a buffer living with you to distract from your marital problems.<eos> It used to be me.<eos> Now it's Raj and his attack Tribble.<eos> Anyway, I'm sorry for everything.<eos> Oh, and FYI... if you cry while they're fighting, they'll take you to McDonald's.
That didn't happen.<eos> You also got a nosebleed watching Up.<eos> Just do your laundry!<eos> Stuart, you didn't have to make dinner.<eos> Yeah, well, I felt bad about upsetting you this morning.
Hey, what's up?<eos> I broke up with Rebecca.<eos> Oh. You know, good for you.<eos> No, I miss her.<eos> I don't know why I listened to you.
Say something.<eos> that is pretty annoying.<eos> I made you tea.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm sorry I called you a quitter.
Well, yeah, you kept saying how overweight I am.<eos> Peter, don't you get it?<eos> I only wanted you to eat healthy because I love you, And I'm concerned about your health.<eos> I want you around for as long as I'm around.<eos> Really? Well, I love you, too, lois.
Nick, you would tell me if you were gonna murder me, right?<eos> No, 'cause then you could prepare for it, you silly.<eos> What is wrong with you?<eos> - What is wrong with me?<eos> - Yeah. The guy taking you to San Diego... the Paris of Southern California?
You ended a relationship without any confrontation.<eos> You got what you wanted. Then why do I feel so terrible?<eos> Maybe you feel bad because your relationship with Reagan actually meant something to you, and you ended it like it didn't.<eos> Right.<eos> I'm sorry I put you in the middle of this, Aly.
Welcome to the loft.<eos> Hey. Taking a little trip?<eos> I hear San Diego's lovely.<eos> I regret that.<eos> I'm sorry I left you on the train, Reagan.
Strange man.<eos> I love Wednesday nights.<eos> And this one's even more special, 'cause I got my name back.<eos> I love you, Cece.<eos> I love you so much, Winston.
Stop. N... You know what, I don't care.<eos> Come on.<eos> Cha-ching.<eos> Hey, hey, Jess!<eos> Jess! I've been trying to call you.
Whoa. What?<eos> I did.<eos> It's always the person you least expect.<eos> I was just... Trying to get some alone time.<eos> Because I bugged you so much?
You go grab melissa, I'll go get my travel underwear.<eos> Pick up that spare first.<eos> Picked up the spare!<eos> Why are you being so stubborn about giving us your address?<eos> We're doing this to help you.
One-sixth of an inch avenue, Tandy's penis is tiny city, ohio.<eos> You know what...<eos> You know what, where you live?<eos> You live on the intersection of, You don't know what you're talking about street. And, mind your own business boulevard.<eos> God! I don't know why you don't want us to help you.
Okay. I know I'm still recovering, But she's weirder than normal, right?<eos> I really can't tell anymore.<eos> So this is you?<eos> And just our luck, She lived in a 19-story walk-up.<eos> Thanks for telling us where you lived, This is really gonna help us help you.
Hey. Tortilla chip delivery.<eos> They're scoops, of course.<eos> Carol. I don't need anything special.<eos> Copy that, gail.<eos> You may have noticed that I called you gail?
Todd showed me how to do it.<eos> It's therapeutic.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> Look, I already know what's happening.<eos> I scared you away. With my extreme pilbasianity.
Detective Reagan.<eos> That's Detective Baez.<eos> And I don't have anything to say to you.<eos> Yeah, you do. We're gonna have a nice, gentlemanly conversation.<eos> Otherwise, the two of us are gonna throw you in that car, take you down to the squad and shine a white-hot light in your eyes, you understand?
What is it?<eos> When the M.E. said it was an adult, I don't know, something happened.<eos> A bad feeling inside, like a sinking feeling.<eos> Uh-huh. So I did some sniffing around.<eos> And your bad feeling led you to...?
They using your moms to get in your head.<eos> Read her bedtime stories anytime I had to work a double shift.<eos> Listen to her, JB.<eos> She knows you better than anybody else.<eos> She's trying to help you.
You weren't there!<eos> Adam, let me talk to you for a minute in the kitchen.<eos> Come on.<eos> What?<eos> I just brought you in here so Dad could leave.
No, that's a grandpa's job.<eos> He's teetering.<eos> Yep. And now the little one for the win.<eos> Please go to the doctor, Grandpa.<eos> I love you so much.
Your sister...<eos> She died at the Al-Qaeda train bombing.<eos> This is not about my sister.<eos> Whatever it is that's happening between you two, you have to stop it.<eos> I like you, Sasha.
You can see all my thoughts so... You should be able to secure them.<eos> Try and understand your importance Mira.<eos> You're what everyone will become one day.<eos> You don't know how alone that makes me feel.<eos> I can see you out there, you know.
What is that?<eos> I c-c-can't remember, but I am haunted by it.<eos> Do You see it?<eos> Togusa!<eos> Don't take the medication that they give you.
Well, that's my pitch.<eos> I always was a better spy than a salesman.<eos> So, what do you say?<eos> My bad.<eos> So, I'll leave you be, then.
The bullets could've been real.<eos> Then the body armor would've been real.<eos> I don't know you, but... I don't like to be tested.<eos> Gibbons never believed you were dead!<eos> Never stopped looking for you.
Those, I'll have within 15 minutes.<eos> Kidding.<eos> But if you need a fifty of Purple Urkle, I am not the girl to ask.<eos> Okay, Cage, follow me.<eos> I'll introduce you to your ground team.
And if I'm scared, I can't do my job.<eos> And if I can't do my job, then people die.<eos> And if people die, then who am I tech-supporting?<eos> Literally no one.<eos> But I will make sure to keep you safe.
I'm just doing the math.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> What math?<eos> Air velocity divided by distance.<eos> So, when I stuff you down the toilet, search and rescue will know where to find you between China and North Korea.
What was I thinking?<eos> Look at me. My life is in ruins.<eos> I'm doing nothing but quickie divorces and hawking life insurance.<eos> Yeah, maybe you should've thought of that before you took Ed's money.<eos> I told you, man, I didn't take Ed's money.
Andy, you need to turn yourself in.<eos> Turn myself in?<eos> Are you kidding me? With Chris dead?<eos> Now that's fucking felony-murder.<eos> Andy, I can't get you out of this.
- Don't you play fucking dumb with me!<eos> - I don't have it!<eos> - Really? - You haven't seen Ed recently?<eos> - I'm afraid you've been misinformed.<eos> You should be afraid that I'm gonna shoot you in the.
Well.<eos> I can't go nowhere until after I meet up with Andy at ten.<eos> No, Chris, just you.<eos> Ed doesn't trust that Andy won't do something stupid.<eos> But he can trust you, right?
Look, he's right, Chris.<eos> My brother doesn't even lock the door.<eos> I think he figures that the fact that he's inside, no one is gonna try anything.<eos> Seriously, he must be the stupidest cop in the history of the police force.<eos> - Hey, Ed, can I talk to you a sec?
Let me guess.<eos> Step two:<eos> Unlock vault.<eos> Shut the fuck up!<eos> Or I'll shoot you in the face!
- I'm not Ed! I'm Doug! Schwarzenegger!<eos> Arnold's less successful.<eos> Fuck it! All right.<eos> Yeah, it's me!<eos> I'm gonna be long gone, anyway, by the time they get you out of that fucking vault.
Hey. Here.<eos> Get in the fucking vault!<eos> Get in the fucking vault, Zeke!<eos> And if I suffocate in there before morning, I guess that'll be an accident too, right?<eos> Do you want me to kill you?
Do you want me to kill you?<eos> 'Cause I can fucking do that!<eos> You know what they say.<eos> Once you take a life, it's always easier the second time.<eos> I could kill you.
And once they're dead, you'll kill Andy.<eos> What?<eos> And then, once all your loose ends are tied up, you're gonna disappear with the money, never to be heard from again.<eos> Except.<eos> None of that's gonna happen 'cause I'm gonna kill you. And I'm gonna bury you in a hole out by Shimmer Lake.
Okay, impeached.<eos> Too late.<eos> I resign.<eos> I was first.<eos> This could be a great thing for you, sweetie.
Bina and Jerry Kepp, hello.<eos> Oh, Jesus Christ.<eos> Walter.<eos> Hello, Roger.<eos> Nice to see you.
That was an overreaction, okay?<eos> I had too many of the mini hotdogs and...<eos> Can we just forget about it?<eos> That won't be easy.<eos> Teddy Millner is leaving you to raise a child alone.
I constantly disappoint you.<eos> Then you tell me that you think our kid will grow up thinking that I'm just a joke.<eos> That I was never good enough for you.<eos> And you finally found a way to tell me.<eos> And I was so scared of losing you that when you told me you were pregnant, lasked if you wanted to keep the kid.
And you finally found a way to tell me.<eos> And I was so scared of losing you that when you told me you were pregnant, lasked if you wanted to keep the kid.<eos> I'm ridiculous in a million ways. I am.<eos> I know that.<eos> But I can't spend my whole life disappointing you" No, he doesn't get... on.
Oh, my God!<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> That's disgusting.<eos> This wedding is over for you.<eos> I need you to give me the phone number of somebody that I can call to get you out of here right now. Oh!
What did you do?<eos> It was hard to hear, you know, with, like, the wind and Nikki in my ear, and then, when I got on the railing, everybody started shouting.<eos> And then underwater, you can't, like, hear anything underwater.<eos> But it sounded like, you know, you were getting to something good.<eos> It was like about how, if you're, shit, ready to be, like, the person who always forgives me, then I want to be the person who always forgives you.
You're gonna make him fat. Oh, yeah, lam.<eos> Well, We are.<eos> Here you go, Ringo.<eos> Okay, you're sure you didn't forget anybody?<eos> I told you a million times, okay?
- Up here.<eos> - Hi, sweetheart.<eos> - I'm scared.<eos> - Where have you been?<eos> - Yes, I'm gonna get you down.
Grown man wears spandex to work.<eos> So does Superman.<eos> Hey, fuck you!<eos> Get off my beach!<eos> I don't even have to stretch to guard you.
Way too hard.<eos> Trying's the best part.<eos> - Summer.<eos> - Hi.<eos> I was hoping we'd see you here.
I'm just... I'm really...<eos> Really excited to quit my double major in robotics and computer science and really, really do something with my life.<eos> You don't need to look down there.<eos> Do not touch me right now.<eos> - Not even touching you. - Okay.
Guys, we can talk about this.<eos> Leon doesn't talk.<eos> He's a man of action.<eos> - There's a purity to that.<eos> - I'm going to kill you.
- There's a purity to that.<eos> - I'm going to kill you.<eos> Damn it.<eos> You do that every time.<eos> I build you up, and then you ruin the mystique.
That's polluting.<eos> Listen, Mitch, I know I messed up, okay?<eos> I should have listened.<eos> I want to be a part of this team.<eos> And I will not let you down again, I swear.
Oh, my God!<eos> Shut your mouth.<eos> You're gonna get us caught.<eos> I'm laying on a dead old lady.<eos> Well, she's not going to bite you, for Christ's sakes.
- Splish, splash.<eos> - Otherwise, I'll fire you.<eos> Now I gotta go clean up this mess that you made.<eos> Obviously, you have every reason to be upset, and I apologize.<eos> So, do you always do the opposite of what people ask you to do?
- For Mitch.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Lifeguards, this is a surprise.<eos> - Oh, hi!<eos> Victoria, we wanted to come here in person and tell you how excited we are to be working with you instead of against you, now that...
Morning.<eos> Sammy!<eos> What?<eos> You forgot your gloves!<eos> Izzy, how many times do I have to tell you?
Last year, Matt literally sent me a dozen red roses.<eos> Matt, oh, come on.<eos> You just spent a whole week crying in the same pair of sweatpants and it got dark.<eos> We're not going back there.<eos> No, I've told you a thousand times, I'll say it again, you do not need that loser.
Okay, glad to hear it.<eos> So, that's a maybe, or...<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Well, I'll take that "No" as a "Maybe."<eos> So, maybe I'll see you tonight.
- Okay.<eos> - You can shut up now.<eos> What?<eos> Matt's at the party.<eos> Ally, you say "Matt" one more time and I will kill you in your sleep.
- You can shut up now.<eos> What?<eos> Matt's at the party.<eos> Ally, you say "Matt" one more time and I will kill you in your sleep.<eos> I will kill you in your sleep. I will kill you in your sleep.
I'm going back to sleep.<eos> I'm going to sleep in my room.<eos> I'm going with her.<eos> You were friends with Juliet?<eos> No one even talked to you in fifth grade, and I don't hold that against you.
It's different.<eos> But you have a big heart, Sam.<eos> That doesn't go away.<eos> One good thing.<eos> You just focus on that one good thing, and you see where it leads you.
Juliet!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I know what happened back there.<eos> Get away from me.<eos> And I feel really bad about it, and I know this may sound crazy, but I have a feeling I may be able to understand you better than you think that I could.
We all have been bitches, and I...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I have to go.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> I'm trying to tell you how sorry...
I can't.<eos> Sam!<eos> Sam!<eos> Why did you run away from me?<eos> I can't talk to you right now.
You can't help me.<eos> I can't be fixed.<eos> You're not the one who needs fixing.<eos> There is nothing wrong with you.<eos> Don't let anyone tell you that there is.
- No.<eos> Besides, I'm going.<eos> Fine.<eos> You don't listen to me.<eos> Every time I ask you where something comes from...
Are they fighting over food?<eos> Maybe Hannah's hiding something in her mouth.<eos> Nope.<eos> Nothing in there.<eos> What's going on with you?
Come on, come on.<eos> They're here. They're here.<eos> I'm being careful.<eos> Hey, sweetie.<eos> Good to see you.
Here, here.<eos> I got it.<eos> Fran.<eos> Stop it. Stop.<eos> Good to see you, Ethan.
Ethan!<eos> It's Grandpa.<eos> Ethan?<eos> Are you here?<eos> I can't smell you.
Let's see.<eos> He belongs to...<eos> Come on, Ethan.<eos> I can smell you in there.<eos> I don't wanna leave you here.
You have to have the courage to go your own way.<eos> Happiness is hard to come by.<eos> Sure as hell aren't gonna find it in some stupid gadget.<eos> There you are, tapping on some little box... while the real shit is happening all around you, dumbass.<eos> I hate you so much.
Good deal.<eos> Wife?<eos> Kids?<eos> Hey, asshole!<eos> I'm talking to you.
No! I'm not letting go!<eos> Let it go!<eos> Wilson!<eos> I'm gonna kick his ass!<eos> Believe me, Pippi gave you a true gift... by giving you away, because we were in no position to be parents.
She was on the street, strung out on drugs... comforting strangers.<eos> I never was on the street.<eos> Look, it doesn't...<eos> Don't get bogged down in the details right now.<eos> We're just thrilled to finally have the opportunity to get to meet you!
Come on.<eos> How about I take you for ice cream?<eos> Is that supposed to be funny?<eos> Yeah, let's get the fat girl some ice cream.<eos> Hey, not everybody's out to get you, Claire.
Can you?<eos> She's a sweet kid with two crazy people stalking her.<eos> We're not stalking her.<eos> Wilson.<eos> And how many times do I have to tell you what I'm going through, huh?
They went for a walk.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Pippi.<eos> I was afraid I'd never see you again.
It's me.<eos> It's two and a half years.<eos> I never heard a word.<eos> I...<eos> I tried to get my lawyer to find you.
I'm so happy.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> When Claire turned on me at the trial... I don't think I've ever been more devastated.<eos> I just thank you for not testifying against me.
Are you okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> When Claire turned on me at the trial... I don't think I've ever been more devastated.<eos> I just thank you for not testifying against me.<eos> Yeah, but I should've been up there fighting for you.
"Was?"<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> She got so sick, Wilson. And in the end she could barely even...<eos> She could barely even lift her little head.<eos> I tried to find you.
It might be George about tomorrow.<eos> Hello?<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> Look, he has no interest in talking to you, and we'd... just prefer if you don't call this number anymore, okay?
I don't think so.<eos> Please, Claire?<eos> I wouldn't be in your way.<eos> Claire?<eos> Can I at least come visit you?
I'll see you tomorrow.<eos> Are the men ready?<eos> Yes, they are.<eos> Are you sure about this, my Lord?<eos> Listen to me, woman. I need you to do as I tell you.
Who's coming back?<eos> The born king.<eos> Yeah, and when he does, he'll spank your arse.<eos> Now, let's get your hands clean while you still got some.<eos> He'll cut 'em off and have you in chains.
The born king.<eos> Yeah, and when he does, he'll spank your arse.<eos> Now, let's get your hands clean while you still got some.<eos> He'll cut 'em off and have you in chains.<eos> If we can catch you, they can catch you.
How'd you get money from a Viking?<eos> I feel a joke coming on here.<eos> You ask him for it.<eos> You're paying and then you're leaving.<eos> Nobody's talking to you, sweetheart.
As you were, mate.<eos> All right, where do you want me?<eos> Trigger, I think we got one here.<eos> Bouncing on my knee.<eos> Where do you think I want you?
So, you will be his guide.<eos> And you will help me.<eos> Bring him here.<eos> There's a crowd of thousands out there.<eos> They've come to see you more than they've come to see me.
King Vortigern!<eos> They may have come for you, but they will leave and will leave with a lasting impression of me.<eos> They may even hate me.<eos> I'll let them hate just so long as they fear.<eos> When people fear you, I mean, really fear you, it is the most intoxicating sensation a man can possess.
They may have come for you, but they will leave and will leave with a lasting impression of me.<eos> They may even hate me.<eos> I'll let them hate just so long as they fear.<eos> When people fear you, I mean, really fear you, it is the most intoxicating sensation a man can possess.<eos> A force of something almost indescribable moves through your blood and takes you over completely.
Now tell us, king, what do you have to say?<eos> When your head rolls to me, the legend you've fast become will just as quickly...<eos> Here are your people.<eos> ...add to the reverence of my name.<eos> And for this, I salute you.
Run, son!<eos> Wait here, son.<eos> Run, son!<eos> You are resisting the sword.<eos> The sword isn't resisting you.
It's all gone.<eos> They torched the lot.<eos> I said, go on.<eos> You should be flattered, mate.<eos> Even Mercia left the castle to look for you and that sword.
Stop looking around and look at me.<eos> I'm a target, aren't I?<eos> God help us. They've sent me a buffoon.<eos> You are a cunning old bastard, Vortigern.<eos> But what you fail to understand is that it's you who's fed the hangman that will eventually come for you.
Man, I'll fix it.<eos> Calm down.<eos> Get the bag.<eos> I can't believe you thought I'd do some shit like that, man.<eos> I hit you when I'm on the way back.
Here you go.<eos> Get the stuff now.<eos> Meet me in my office. Five minutes.<eos> Rob.<eos> Good to see you.
There's a lot of cops downstairs.<eos> Cops all over the casino.<eos> We need to get out of here.<eos> Casino's always full of cops.<eos> They follow you?
Come here!<eos> Thomas!<eos> Dad!<eos> Dad!<eos> I swear to God, you little shit, if you make a scene, I'll fucking kill you!
My cousin's.<eos> So look...<eos> My family...<eos> We have a lot of friends.<eos> So there's gonna be nowhere that you can go that we won't be able to find you.
Why don't you call for fucking backup?<eos> Because I can't trust anybody!<eos> Where are them drugs?<eos> Fuck you!<eos> I'm gonna kill you, Bryant!
Because I can't trust anybody!<eos> Where are them drugs?<eos> Fuck you!<eos> I'm gonna kill you, Bryant!<eos> I'll kill you!
Thomas, I want you to stay right there.<eos> I'm on my way.<eos> Dad, I'm scared.<eos> I know, I know.<eos> There's a lot of things I gotta explain to you.
I'm fucked anyway.<eos> We been friends 20 years.<eos> You gonna fuckin' rat on me?<eos> What do you mean, rat on you?<eos> I got all the information on you and could've took you down.
- Yeah. A few additions.<eos> There you go.<eos> You gonna square up?<eos> I'll give it to Hank on delivery, Wednesday.<eos> Is that all right with you?
Any excuse, not to work?<eos> I invite you to my home, and I'm a prisoner in my own house?<eos> Hey!<eos> Look at what you made me do, Paul.<eos> Don't make me hurt you. Do not!
Alone! - And I need the police to find that out.<eos> - You need the police? I can recognize a sign from providence when I come across one because I have received so few.<eos> Oy, come over here.<eos> Hands on your head, get on the ground.<eos> I am grateful to you, Jack.
Okay, guys, clear out.<eos> Here.<eos> Make the most of it.<eos> It's gonna be your last for a while.<eos> We've been tracking you down for three years.
But something's missing.<eos> Tell me something, Paul. If I was to dig underneath your pond I mean, really underneath your pond would I find your wife?<eos> All right, Jack.<eos> Your odds in court went up, no question.<eos> Can I talk to you, just you and me?
Lock me up in a mental institution, whatever, but no needle.<eos> I deserve to live with this pain.<eos> You had your chance with me.<eos> - I'm done. - No, listen to me! You owe this to me.<eos> It was up to me to pick you up on the road.
Welcome back, Danny.<eos> Thanks.<eos> All right, that's me done, Tee.<eos> All right.<eos> I'm following you in.
Any objections?<eos> Okay, Ricks.<eos> let's chart a course, and take a closer look.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Captain, can I talk to you for a second?
Come in, please.<eos> Come in.<eos> Do you read me?<eos> Are you reading me, Landing Team?<eos> Yes, we read you.
Hi.<eos> I'm Smurfette.<eos> Oh, my geez-to-petes!<eos> I'm Smurfblossom.<eos> Nice to meet you.
It's sad, really.<eos> You're coming with me.<eos> You can point him out. Hey.<eos> There's no way he's getting on a...<eos> I feel the need to remind you, my name is Clumsy.
Let's get the hell out of here.<eos> - I don't recognize it.<eos> - Me, neither.<eos> But if there's a person alive who can, it's Ritchie.<eos> Are you forgetting when you made your friend despise you?
Neat, isn't it?<eos> The House keeps my valuables out of phase, so they don't go wondering off.<eos> But, still, the timing of the Stone's appearance and its power indicates that it's somehow involved with these crimes.<eos> Which is why it stays here, where only I can get to it.<eos> I think me, them, and everyone else who knows you might want it to be somewhere else.
I just hope he doesn't realize it's me doing the calling.<eos> Who dares strike at me?<eos> The Defender of the Green... Swamp Thing.<eos> Perfect.<eos> Glad to see you back on your feet, Zatanna.
Let me see your madness.<eos> Well, that's the trouble with someone like me.<eos> Been there, done that.<eos> I shall make you beg for death.<eos> Can I beg you to stop talking?
I'm not smart, I do not like playing, You will not become a professional.<eos> I would like to end your case Factor in a plant like me? Each bimonthly party is held For $ 40 in a bar?<eos> Do not want it.<eos> So I do not like this machine.<eos> No, she does not love you either.
Your father prepared breakfast for you.<eos> O hell!<eos> - On your messenger! - Pay attention to your words.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Your father will take you out of school today.
Listen, Joe. Whatever you do, You do not have to.<eos> There is always another way.<eos> It is my business, boy, Forget that you know.<eos> In the end, if I do not, You have to take responsibility.<eos> I can no longer cover you.
The word "Joe", I can not. Old, selfish.<eos> I do not understand, "woe".<eos> I was to give you my kidney last week.<eos> Most likely it does not suit me.<eos> I used to give it to you anyway.
I think there is a reward.<eos> Reward?<eos> Yes, I need money, My grandmother was arrested last night.<eos> You know how it is, right, brother?<eos> I must speak with you.
No, it's a New York State license.<eos> It's what they look like.<eos> I love the energy.<eos> Yeah, it's like being in a blender.<eos> It's nice, and I could show it to you.
Sometimes he hires people.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I mean he hires them to watch over me.<eos> That guy staring at me.<eos> - No one's staring at you.
He's gone.<eos> Come on.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Getting us out of here!<eos> What's wrong with you?
Come on.<eos> - Get in!<eos> - What's happening?<eos> Your life's in danger.<eos> Someone's been hired to kill you.
Please, look at me.<eos> Stay here, please.<eos> Ella, I'm begging you, stay here.<eos> Don't get into that car, please.<eos> What's wrong with you, Ella? !
They're going to be looking for a young girl and a man.<eos> I can't.<eos> I'll freak out.<eos> There are people out there that are still hunting you.<eos> They're gonna kill you.
I finish what I start.<eos> And when we find the girl, we find Lucas.<eos> We've got other problems besides the girl, Richard.<eos> Like what?<eos> Her father wasn't just planning to sell you out to the feds. He diverted funds from your U.S. accounts.
Please.<eos> Please, you don't have to do this.<eos> You don't have to.<eos> Please.<eos> No, no, no, I'm not gonna hurt you.
Please, you don't have to do this.<eos> You don't have to.<eos> Please.<eos> No, no, no, I'm not gonna hurt you.<eos> I'm not gonna hurt you.
Okay? It's not...<eos> I'm not gonna do anything to you.<eos> All right?<eos> Just...<eos> Look, I was hired to kill you, but I'm not going to do it 'cause...
I need to call home.<eos> I need to call my dad.<eos> Let me speak to my dad.<eos> Your father's dead.<eos> I was meant to kill you first as a message.
I just wanted to tell you we got the girl.<eos> She's been taken care of.<eos> I guess all your trouble was for nothing.<eos> You're on the run by now, I expect.<eos> I don't suppose I'll find you.
Everyone says that.<eos> Gonna be sticking around for a while?<eos> No, I'm supposed to go back in a couple of days.<eos> Can you not stay a bit longer?<eos> It'd be nice to see you, get to, you know, spend some time together.
Fuck.<eos> Fuck!<eos> So you're Plan B.<eos> Yes.<eos> I am to persuade you to stay and help him.
- Why?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Because he has a lot of money.<eos> Or at least he had a lot of money at the time, anyway.<eos> The room service guy, he comes in, and he sees this scene that I just described to you, and he says, "George Best..."
The point is, we need cash now, not in six months' time.<eos> And you realize what's at stake here?<eos> I promised to set up a sauna for Veronika.<eos> And if I don't get it up and running soon, she's gonna leave me.<eos> - Fucking leave you anyway. - No, it's not gonna happen.
You've never even fucked her.<eos> I have fucked her, and I'll fuck her again. - What?<eos> When she was working at the sauna?<eos> - That's not fair.<eos> I can tell you that fully consensual, emotionally driven, not-for-profit sexual intercourse has been attained.
I'm sorry I didn't mention it.<eos> You might've heard something?<eos> All right, fuck it.<eos> I knew.<eos> I knew, and I could have served you up to him on a plate any time I wanted to.
Until the day they all found themselves imitating her.<eos> Please, just tell me one more thing about her.<eos> Your mother was... fearless.<eos> Fearless.<eos> So... what can I bring you from the market?
We have to do something.<eos> You are the wildest... most gorgeous thing I have ever seen.<eos> Nobody deserves you.<eos> But at least I know our children will be beautiful.<eos> Am I catching you at a bad time?
Papa, is that you?<eos> Belle!<eos> How did you find me?<eos> Your hands are ice.<eos> We need to get you home.
Come into the light.<eos> Choose.<eos> Belle, I won't let you do this.<eos> I lost your mother.<eos> I won't lose you, too.
I don't understand.<eos> Where did you...<eos> He took me there.<eos> I know what happened to Maman.<eos> Then you know why I had to leave her there. I had to protect you.
Hello.<eos> I believe this is yours.<eos> She's very headstrong.<eos> Do you have children?<eos> No one to protect you now, huh?
Have you prayed about it?<eos> I just want your truck.<eos> But you know this isn't a good idea, right?<eos> I mean, what if it is that guy?<eos> And then he's trying to get you out there for who knows what reason.
Some papa you are.<eos> Pretty chilly out here?<eos> Got a fire goin' inside, if you wanna warm up.<eos> Come on, mack.<eos> I know someone who'd love to see you.
My, my, my.<eos> Look at you.<eos> Do I know you?<eos> Not very well. But we can work on that.<eos> I've been so lookin' forward to this. To finally see you face to face.
I am that I am.<eos> Look at that.<eos> Already quoting' scripture.<eos> And you've met my son.<eos> Great to see you, mack.
You, on the other hand, were created to be loved.<eos> Living unloved is like clipping a bird's wings.<eos> Pain has a way of doing that to us.<eos> If it's left unresolved, you can forget what you were created for.<eos> That's not something i want for you.
Love is meant to exist within a relationship, mack.<eos> That's all we wanna have with you.<eos> Even if you can't see it.<eos> You are in the center of our love and purpose.<eos> As beautiful as all this is, it's nothing compared to how we see you.
My what?<eos> Your wrath.<eos> You lost me there.<eos> Come on.<eos> Everybody knows you punish the people who disappoint you.
Careful.<eos> That one's deadly.<eos> What's it doing here if it's poisonous?<eos> You're presuming that poison is bad.<eos> On its own, the sap from this twig would kill you.
Why are you doing this to me?<eos> This isn't me.<eos> You told me to come out here.<eos> Mack, this is happening inside you.<eos> You're letting it consume you, and you don't have to.
Don't think about the past.<eos> Don't think about the pain.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Everything is gonna be okay.<eos> Trust me, none of this can hurt you.
Just keep your eyes on me.<eos> Breathe.<eos> Good, mack.<eos> I'm not going anywhere.<eos> Now, let's get you out of this boat.
You must choose one of your children to spend eternity in heaven.<eos> The other will go to hell.<eos> I can't do...<eos> Can't do what?<eos> I'm only asking you to do something you believe god does.
She shuts you out.<eos> You're not even sure if she loves you anymore.<eos> Or you could choose Josh.<eos> He's been disobedient.<eos> Sneaking out. Lying to you.
Is that...<eos> Dad.<eos> Mack, I'm so sorry.<eos> For everything.<eos> I was blind, and I couldn't see you.
Always.<eos> For what we have to do today, you're gonna need a father.<eos> Where we going?<eos> Almost there.<eos> We're here to do something that's going to be very painful for you.
Nobody gets away with anything.<eos> Everything bears consequences.<eos> What he did...<eos> Was horrible.<eos> I'm not asking you to excuse what he did.
I'm asking you to trust me to do what's right and to know what's best.<eos> And then what?<eos> Forgiveness doesn't establish a relationship.<eos> It's just about letting go of his throat.<eos> Mack, the pain inside is devouring you. Robbing you of joy and crippling your capacity to love.
And so is everything you do.<eos> Every time you love, mack, or forgive... With every act of kindness, the universe changes. For the better.<eos> If anything matters, then everything matters.<eos> Then I wanna go home.<eos> Well, can we ask you to do something for us when you go?
About everything.<eos> It's okay.<eos> It's okay, we can talk about it later, sweetie.<eos> You just need to rest now.<eos> I got so much to tell you about the lake and papa.
Don't be fooled, intern.<eos> Novels are for people who can't edit themselves.<eos> Cards are still the ultimate challenge.<eos> For you, maybe.<eos> Sweet talk will get you nowhere.
Yeah. You know what them are, fancy man?<eos> Them's people think they're better than other people.<eos> They ain't!<eos> Nobody's better than nobody, that's our motto these days.<eos> And if you think you is, we'll fuck you up till you isn't.
Very well, I will.<eos> - Special caramel!<eos> - All right.<eos> - Uncle Eddie...<eos> - Nice to see you.
- Yes, you were right.<eos> You must have serious problems.<eos> Yes.<eos> Agree.<eos> If you laugh after all that, I'll kill you.
It helped you recover.<eos> - Definitely.<eos> - But it has happened before. Something raises the mood, but it does not work out as you would like. Suddenly you're...<eos> But this time it's different.<eos> - Agree. - That's what I'm telling you.
We'll go to the gate.<eos> He will make fun of how I parked.<eos> Then he will make fun of my clothes.<eos> The joke will not be funny.<eos> Then he will look at you, he will have a revelation and say,
Every year hundreds of people disappear in national parks.<eos> You could take your car to the rocky mountains national park. It is not far away. You leave it open with a lit cigarette,<eos> - and you disappear.<eos> - I like it.<eos> I'll pick you up.
- And we'll think about it.<eos> - I'm calling you now.<eos> You can not call me now because I have a son.<eos> I have neighbors.<eos> I can not get you inside.
I do not want to be in that world.<eos> And even if I wanted to, I could not because I can not go to my casino.<eos> I was forbidden to enter.<eos> I do not know how, but I have to earn all that money before Monday and... I'm lost, gene.<eos> I'll tell you right now. The worst thing a godfather can tell you.
- If it is okay.<eos> - All right.<eos> Do you say it because I'm in the hospital?<eos> Maybe a little.<eos> Because the robe suits you.
How about you blow on them to make them safe?<eos> Fuck off, Logan.<eos> So you remember who I am now.<eos> I always know who you are.<eos> It's just sometimes I don't recognize you.
Yeah, not for long.<eos> You get him back in his ride, take him out to the wash and dump him.<eos> What if he wakes up before I get there?<eos> Text me where you are.<eos> We'll pick you up.
Take these now.<eos> We have to get out of here.<eos> It's not safe here anymore.<eos> And you can't have an attack out there, you understand?<eos> Yes, but this is the mutant that I told you about.
I asked you a question.<eos> Who are you?<eos> You know who she is, Logan.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> Does she remind you of anybody?
This is not the first time I've hurt people.<eos> Until today, I didn't know.<eos> You wouldn't tell me.<eos> So we just kept on running away from it.<eos> I think I finally understand you.
No.<eos> I know, I understand.<eos> This is a long way.<eos> You understand?<eos> I am not taking you to North Dakota.
Daddy didn't learn a Big Sean song, right?<eos> Daddy learned the song from Rent.<eos> - We can do the same dance moves. - All right, look, Ally,<eos> I know this dance is a big deal for you, okay?<eos> And I'm not gonna let you down.
Some... Something weird is going on around here.<eos> - Okay?<eos> - Okay.<eos> Yeah. Tell Ally I'll see her at 2:30.<eos> Daddy says he'll see you at 2:30.
Tyler really was pitting us against each other, and...<eos> After school, you gonna meet me in the parking lot, and we gonna handle this shit the primitive way.<eos> With our fists.<eos> You can't be serious.<eos> I can't wait to fuck you up.
Thank you, Coach.<eos> Let's go!<eos> Everybody, on the track!<eos> Clifford, stop doggin' it.<eos> I will fuck you up.
- Right on the Flintstone.<eos> - That was hot.<eos> At 100%, it's a toss-up whether the other twin gets back up.<eos> That's not good because Strickland's definitely gonna punch me at 100%.<eos> Oh, no. He gonna punch you at 110%.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.<eos> I knew that you wouldn't stand up to these people. I just knew it.<eos> - Wait, I'm sorry, what do you mean, you knew I wouldn't stand up to them?<eos> That came out wrong.<eos> What I'm saying is that, you know, sometimes, you just let people push you around.
She always wins the talent show.<eos> Maybe you'll win the talent show. Right?<eos> I've been practicing all the moves!<eos> - Oh! - You know what I mean? I got them down!<eos> I'm not gonna let you down. Right? Okay?
Ask the man a question.<eos> Yeah, I could put it in question form.<eos> - Do you want your job back?<eos> - No!<eos> I'm done with this place, and I woulda told you that if you weren't in my goddamn business again.
Do you hear yourself?<eos> I mean, you've become unhinged!<eos> Maybe.<eos> But let me tell you something.<eos> You don't show up to that fight this afternoon, an unhinged man might wanna do something real nasty to you.
- Fucking animals.<eos> - Yeah, little... Little...<eos> Little animals!<eos> Right.<eos> Listen. Since I ran into you, I have to tell you, we moved your interview back to 2:15.
You wanna find out?<eos> Hey! Don't do it.<eos> You be a man.<eos> I refuse!<eos> You know, first I was just gonna punch you a whole lot, Campbell.
Yeah, getting locked up. It's fucking...<eos> This is some BS, right?<eos> Shit.<eos> I... I don't mean to, you know, interrupt your seething or whatever it is you're doing over here, but I just got in a little argument with my friend and he starts talking some serious shit about you.<eos> And he's goin' on and on, and he's calling you a bitch, and a big fat pussy, and a little fucking pussy bitch, and he says that you're his bitch.
I... I don't mean to, you know, interrupt your seething or whatever it is you're doing over here, but I just got in a little argument with my friend and he starts talking some serious shit about you.<eos> And he's goin' on and on, and he's calling you a bitch, and a big fat pussy, and a little fucking pussy bitch, and he says that you're his bitch.<eos> - What?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I couldn't believe it. He just keeps going on and on and on that he wants to fight you.
I can see that that's not it. Okay. I tell you what.<eos> I'll go over there, and if he nods like this that means he wants to fight you now.<eos> But again, man, he's not gonna come here because he thinks you're a big fat bitch.<eos> Again, these are his words, they're not mine.<eos> So just look for that nod and know that he's calling you the biggest bitch on the planet.
Fuck this shit. - Campbell, stay down!<eos> Campbell, stay down!<eos> Bruce Lee style!<eos> God damn it.<eos> Right here. I should just kill you.
Hey! Hey!<eos> You cut out all that grab-assing.<eos> You get your ass to detention, Freddie.<eos> All right, I'm not joking around. You get there before I kick it there!<eos> I will kick you into oblivion, Freddie.
I'm a weirdo.<eos> You know my style.<eos> Yeah. I'm stressed out, too.<eos> My neighbor got a cat.<eos> - Oh, you don't like a cat looking at you?
Actress Sridevi.<eos> Why do you always beat about the bush?<eos> I can't help it.<eos> When you smile, it strikes me dumb!<eos> And I just feel like watching you!
Here.<eos> - Hello?<eos> - Raees, Musa here.<eos> Yes?<eos> Jairaj hired the assassin to kill you.
Only 22,000?<eos> Darn it!<eos> Freaking duffer!<eos> Business meant life to you.<eos> And finally, they traded you.
Tell me. Are you here to meet me or to conduct a raid?<eos> Well, rest assured. Everything is legal about Our World.<eos> Liquor pays for the construction.<eos> What could be more legal?<eos> Luck favors you these days.
The cops will be here any moment. Run, Raees!<eos> I won't run<eos> I'm not a coward, Sadiq! I'm not!<eos> You are innocent. And to prove that, you should live.<eos> If you don't escape, they will... kill you!
I don't see riders.<eos> Hold it!<eos> I saw them coming.<eos> At least this time...<eos> I was able to protect you...
You really think he let you live?<eos> After we are gone?<eos> You let them call you donkey.<eos> You are ape.<eos> Colonel wants see you.
Or they cannot finish it.<eos> -You know, you're very emotional.<eos> What makes you think you're in a position to make demands?<eos> Okay, let's go.<eos> -The soldiers who are coming here, they are not coming to join you, are they?
Ciao, boys!<eos> So what do you want?<eos> Mom, do I have a twin brother?<eos> How did you find out?<eos> Who told you?
Ahhhh!<eos> Brother!<eos> I am hugging you!<eos> I'm so happy!<eos> After all these years, finally I'm meeting you!
Uh we got a corner Cubby set up for you. Right in there.<eos> Label it on your own time.<eos> Hum?<eos> Weird. It doesn't do that, must be the weather.<eos> Anyway let me introduce you to the team.
You know why they call it Shopper's Row?<eos> Cause this is where all the shopping happens.<eos> Want to buy something nice for your sweetie? This is the place to do it.<eos> Zone C. The Food court.<eos> Everything in here will kill you seriously.
How many of them are there?<eos> Is there someplace she can hide?<eos> Wait, what?<eos> No way! I don't get cut out, you promised!<eos> I also promised to keep you safe.
Uh-You're gonna want to see this.<eos> All right listen.<eos> Lock the door. Don't make a sound, don't try to get out, no matter what you hear.<eos> Right?<eos> This is bullshit. Well. I promised to protect you.
Are you? We have to move.<eos> We have to move.<eos> We have to move.<eos> Come on.<eos> Let me get you out of here.
So, I'm going to make you a deal.<eos> From one betrayed, abandoned soul to another.<eos> There's no reason for you to die.<eos> You just can't testify.<eos> So you come with me. I'll take care of you, get you somewhere where we're both safe.
Maybe I'll even teach you a thing or two.<eos> Who knows?<eos> You have a really important decision to make, Jamie.<eos> You can be the child who waits for the white knight who never comes.<eos> You can be immature, brave and stupid and make a run for it in which case I'll have no choice but to kill you.
Eddie!<eos> Eddie! Eddie!<eos> Eddie, Eddie...<eos> You could have been a rich man, Eddie.<eos> I told you, to take the money, turn a blind eye.
'Oh you'd be amazed at what a receptionist picks up.'<eos> - They know everything!<eos> - 'Solved it, then? '<eos> I'm working on it.<eos> 'Oh, Mary, motherhood's slowing you down.'
Tbilisi was six years ago, where's he been?<eos> Mary, I'm sorry to tell you this, but he wants you dead.<eos> Sorry, no, no, because we... we were family.<eos> Families fall out.<eos> The memory stick is the easiest way to track you down.
Of course.<eos> Is that sentiment talking?<eos> No, it's me.<eos> Difficult to tell the difference these days.<eos> Told you, I made a promise.
I've been looking forward to this for longer than you can imagine.<eos> I swear to you, I thought you were dead.<eos> I thought I was the only one who got out.<eos> How did you find us?<eos> By following you, Sherlock Holmes.
Laughter. Gossip.<eos> How the clever agents had been betrayed.<eos> Brought down by you!<eos> Me?<eos> You know I'll kill you too.
- Yes.<eos> - And they were betrayed.<eos> Not by me.<eos> Mycroft, we have known each other a long time.<eos> I promise you, I haven't the foggiest idea what all this is about.
'They know everything.'<eos> - You don't make it easy, do you?<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> Well, being... being so perfect.<eos> Mary, I... I need to tell you...
Within a radius of three kilometers.<eos> We enter the launch code.<eos> The GPS will guide it.<eos> After that, you have five minutes.<eos> Nobody could have done that to you as well as I did.
I repeat: I see the drone.<eos> Let's move.<eos> Come on!<eos> Get out!<eos> Aggy, help us find you.
I'm sorry.<eos> Well, like, I mean, I can fix that.<eos> I know how to trick the SIM. I have, uh...<eos> I have tools. I have to be in my house before 7:00.<eos> Well, if you come to my house before 7:00, then I can fix it for you. Oh!
- It's a rule that me and my dad made. - Thanks, Billy.<eos> They're gonna blow this whole thing.<eos> It'll all be gone in a week.<eos> Billy, can I be honest?<eos> The deal was I drop you somewhere, and I get the van for a few hours, okay?
Then you know I punched his tooth out.<eos> I know they put it back.<eos> Dad, I hope you're watching.<eos> Gonna make you proud.<eos> Dad, I forgot to tell you, uh, I took the van without asking Mom's permission.
- Run!<eos> Didi, I'm coming!<eos> You're real!<eos> Leave her alone!<eos> We will kill you.
Have you morphed yet?<eos> Trick question.<eos> If you could morph, we'd be having a very different conversation.<eos> Mmm. The Yellow Ranger.<eos> Should I kill you?
For whatever reason i-i hung onto it, I connected with it.<eos> You're in there.<eos> I'm in your book?<eos> The first time i said I love you.<eos> Well before I said it to you, I wrote it in there.
So keep having fun out there.<eos> For the both of us.<eos> Love you.<eos> Hey, I must have just missed you.<eos> Well I wanted to tell you that I just bought the tickets so Iceland is a go.
Come on, we're losing daylight.<eos> Fox Leader, this is Chapman, over.<eos> Fox Leader, this is Chapman, over.<eos> Dear Billy...<eos> "...sometimes, life just punch you in the balls.
No matter what people say, what we see is real.<eos> Who's there?<eos> Hey.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I wanted to see you, but--
Well, I am a doctor and I have had some experiences with that in the past.<eos> A little too much, I'm afraid.<eos> It was not a good thing.<eos> Figure it out.<eos> That's what I'm gonna leave you with today.
Last night, I felt this like, warm, bright light.<eos> And...<eos> It felt so real, and it just made me feel, like everything is gonna be okay, you know?<eos> No. No, I don't know.<eos> And if you told your doctor that, he'd hold you here for another week.
- Yeah'?<eos> GRANDMA". What are you doing?<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - Go home and talk to your mother.<eos> I'll call you later.
Hello?<eos> Help.<eos> Help me, please.<eos> Shit.<eos> I feel like I don't know you anymore.
- It'll be over soon.<eos> - Whatever you think of me, it's a lie.<eos> Please, don't.<eos> Don't- - Don't--<eos> - That dress is pretty on you.
- That dress is pretty on you.<eos> - What?<eos> Your dress is pretty.<eos> It's not mine.<eos> Well, it looks good on you.
You know, they've gone down the pub.<eos> It's all on me.<eos> Faith.<eos> Don't you think I should take that?<eos> It's only going to upset you.
You know who.<eos> Impossible.<eos> Nothing's impossible.<eos> You of all people know that.<eos> Coming to get you.
Nothing's impossible.<eos> You of all people know that.<eos> Coming to get you.<eos> - There's an east wind coming, Mycroft.<eos> Coming to get you.
We have more to worry about than her choice of colour scheme.<eos> Barely dry.<eos> Recent.<eos> That's for our benefit.<eos> As a motivator to your continued cooperation, I'm now reconnecting you.
Look what you did to her.<eos> Look what you did to yourself.<eos> All those complicated little emotions. I lost count.<eos> Emotional context, Sherlock.<eos> It destroys you every time.
Help me. Help me, please.<eos> - Yeah, it's flooding. The well is flooding.<eos> Try as long as possible not to drown.<eos> What?<eos> I'm going to find you. I am finding you.
Look how brilliant you are.<eos> Your mind has created the perfect metaphor.<eos> You're high above us, all alone in the sky, and you understand everything except how to land.<eos> Now, I'm just an idiot. But I'm on the ground.<eos> - I can bring you home. - No.
Lam-Lam?<eos> Everyone wants the hot, new thing.<eos> Destroy.<eos> - I've got fresh batteries.<eos> Boom! Mom and Dad don't even know you.
We.<eos> I will help you... but just to get rid of you.<eos> Deal?<eos> Deal.<eos> Here's to never seeing you again.
I wasn't.<eos> I don't care if you were.<eos> Well, I feel like you do care.<eos> That's why I'm apologizing. So, sorry!<eos> Gamora is not the one for you, Quill.
I'm a dancer, Gamora is not.<eos> You just need to find a woman who is pathetic... like you.<eos> I'm hungry.<eos> Hand me some of that yaro root.<eos> It's not ripe yet... and I hate you.
Stop it.<eos> Later on tonight, you're gonna be laying down in your bed... and there's gonna be something squishy in your pillow case.<eos> And you're gonna be like, "What's this?"<eos> And it's gonna be because I put a turd in there!<eos> You put your turd in my bed, I shave you.
Because you're gonna listen to what I gotta say!<eos> I don't gotta listen to nothing!<eos> You betrayed the code!<eos> Ravagers don't deal in kids.<eos> I told you before!
You best be very careful what you say about our captain.<eos> Who the hell is that?<eos> Yondu Udonta...<eos> I have a proposition for you.<eos> I hired Yondu to pick you up... when your mother passed away.
I hired Yondu to pick you up... when your mother passed away.<eos> But instead of returning you...<eos> Yondu kept you.<eos> I have no clue as to why.<eos> Well, I'll tell you why.
Yondu kept you.<eos> I have no clue as to why.<eos> Well, I'll tell you why.<eos> Because I was a skinny little kid who could squeeze into places adults couldn't. It made it easier for thieving'.<eos> Well, I've been trying to track you down ever since.
There's too many of them.<eos> He needs my help.<eos> If you care about him... you need to get me out of these bonds.<eos> They are going to kill him!<eos> I tell you, it was pretty easy to find you.
She was like you.<eos> Disgusting?<eos> Innocent.<eos> Drax?<eos> There's something I must tell you.
We need to talk.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> But I like a woman with some meat on her bones.<eos> What?<eos> I tried to let you down easily by telling you I found you disgusting.
Now, all right...<eos> I know that sounds bad.<eos> Who in the hell do you think you are?<eos> You killed my mother!<eos> I tried... so hard... to find the form... that best suited you... and this is the thanks I get?
Guess I should be glad I was a skinny kid.<eos> Otherwise, you'd have delivered me to this maniac.<eos> You still reckon that's the reason I kept you around, you idiot?<eos> That's what you told me, you old doofus.<eos> Once I figured out what happened to them other kids... I wasn't just gonna hand you over.
Our sensors detect the batteries are below the surface of the planet.<eos> Dive!<eos> Captain?<eos> Captain?<eos> Tell me why Ego wants you here?
He did call you twig.<eos> Nebula...<eos> I was a child like you.<eos> I was concerned with staying alive until the next day, every day.<eos> And I never considered what Thanos was doing to you.
- Hi.<eos> - Oh Carrie, look at that face.<eos> - Oh. Hi.<eos> - Hi, nice to meet you.<eos> - Nice to meet you.
Stacy, Stacy, look who's here.<eos> - And look.<eos> - Oh my God, I can't believe it<eos> Wait until you see Heather, she's about to pop.<eos> Good to see you.
- Yeah.<eos> That's great, is Justin here or Carrie?<eos> Yeah, out in the field with my Mom.<eos> Great.<eos> I thought I'd see you at the funeral.
I just, I really need to go find Justin or Carrie because they're helping me with something.<eos> But, thank you so much for thinking of me and congratulations on all of this, this is so great!<eos> Really good seeing you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Good seeing you too.
- Wow.<eos> Hi.<eos> - Hey Darlin'.<eos> - Hi, how are you?<eos> - Good to see you.
I can't take credit for that, but Justin had a tree-house down at the lake,<eos> Their daddy put it up for them when they were little.<eos> You should make him show it to you while you're here.<eos> Has he shown you around it all?<eos> Hey Carrie, can I talk to you for a minute?
Once you and Lauren start making sales, it'll be fine.<eos> Oh.<eos> Oh, hi!<eos> Come on in.<eos> So good to see you.
that Carrie had nothing to do with it.<eos> She tried to tell me and look, look, her dad uses<eos> - Got it, got it.<eos> - maybe we can talk to him, yeah? - Yeah, maybe.<eos> And I'm, I'm sorry that Carrie had to tell you,
No, I don't want you to be upset.<eos> Justin, it was my fault too, Okay?<eos> I should've...<eos> I should've told you that I knew, so...<eos> But, but, Carrie just told you.
Lauren.<eos> Did you lose your key?<eos> Um, no.<eos> Good.<eos> I came to get my boxes, and I wanted to tell you that I was sorry... and stuff.
That's for you.<eos> Well, thank you.<eos> - Okay bye.<eos> - Take care.<eos> Can I ask you?
It will involve an operation.<eos> And some physical therapy.<eos> Pick it up, Pick it up, you got it, keep going. there you go.<eos> Remember why are you running for.<eos> Assuming all goes well, I'll be coming to see you.
But why.<eos> Is that normal?<eos> - I believe the term is 'euphoria'.<eos> Sorry about the quarantine.<eos> It's to protect you from us, not us from you.
They suck they lie and they use you to get what they want, and then they just throw you away<eos> And the thing is I didn't even like Calculus.<eos> Now it's just Mr. Halls always drunk and nobody can understand what he said... but he doesn't care what we do on our computers<eos> So that's what I look forword to, to Calculus.<eos> To talking to you.
Police?<eos> Terrorists!<eos> There are terrorists here!<eos> What's he writing?<eos> Is this fucking amusing to you?
Yes.<eos> She needs to be perfect for their beauty pageant.<eos> Whatever tests they do on her in there will need to be harmless.<eos> We have a detailed plan on how to rescue her from the event in New York City.<eos> We promise to bring her back to you.
Here is Alfonso!<eos> Where is he?<eos> I got a special treat for Lucy's star super pig.<eos> Chop, chop!<eos> Let me introduce you to someone.
We're just gonna take some of your meat.<eos> And of course, I'm not gonna eat any.<eos> We have tasters for that.<eos> They're a bunch of half-wit, degenerate fucktards!<eos> I'm gonna... I'm gonna poke you in five places.
I want you in my office as soon as we're finished here.<eos> So, like I was saying,<eos> Littlefield's legit.<eos> May I continue?<eos> Is that okay with you, Dougie?
- But this is all I got.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too, Becky.<eos> Shelly, this is the third time she's asked you for money in two weeks.
You know how nervous I get.<eos> Come on.<eos> Besides, I got some great fucking feedback today.<eos> I'll tell you all about it at dinner.<eos> And in between, I'll tell you... how much I love you, and I'll tell you how beautiful you are, and I'll tell you how sexy you are, and those tits, how majestic they are, and that ass...
And I think you should maybe call a doctor or something because I think you might've had a little stroke or something.<eos> Something.<eos> Yes. You can go out now.<eos> Dougie, go.<eos> Come on, let's get you out of here.
Where the hell they got ya?<eos> Oh, no kidding.<eos> Damn.<eos> I'm sorry, Harry.<eos> Uh, just wanted to talk to you about a few things.
What does this all mean?<eos> Tammy, you've been doing excellent work, passing one test after another.<eos> Put out your hands.<eos> Flip 'em over.<eos> "I'm very, very happy to see you again, old friend."
What'd you say your name was, again?<eos> Tammy.<eos> Fuck you, Tammy.<eos> I knew it was going to be you.<eos> It's good to see you again, Diane.
You'll never see me again, and no one will ever hear anything more about Joe McCluskey or your late Mr. Strawberry.<eos> Is there a reason you're not talking to me, Dougie?<eos> What were you and Bushnell discussing earlier?<eos> I saw you... walk into his office carrying a bunch of files.<eos> Uh, some police officers are here to see you, Dougie.
- Non-lethal.<eos> Lowering mayor package through hole.<eos> Madam Mayor!<eos> Thanks for dropping by.<eos> I've only got one thing to say to you, Joker.
Thank you. - Batman, you're the greatest!<eos> - Oh, pray hands, pray hands.<eos> - Thanks for saving the city!<eos> - You're welcome.<eos> Batman, I love you more than my kids!
That was fun!<eos> You okay, Batman?<eos> You seem the opposite of stern.<eos> Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> It's just watching you out there, it was like the world wasn't all darkness anymore.
He's not worth it.<eos> I think after 78 years, I deserve respect!<eos> That is right.<eos> Do you realize that you have never once said the words,<eos> "I hate you, Joker"?
Too much flab, not enough ab.<eos> Why? Because I need you to crunch them.<eos> Citizens of Gotham, we need all of you to join us and help bring this city back together.<eos> I'm just gonna come right out and say it.<eos> I hate you, Joker.
Citizens of Gotham, we need all of you to join us and help bring this city back together.<eos> I'm just gonna come right out and say it.<eos> I hate you, Joker.<eos> - I hate you, too. - I hate you more.<eos> I hate you the most.
I'm just gonna come right out and say it.<eos> I hate you, Joker.<eos> - I hate you, too. - I hate you more.<eos> I hate you the most.<eos> I hate you forever.
Dad says rules are for pussies.<eos> Hello!<eos> we're home.<eos> - We're up here.<eos> but here comes Mommy and Daddy to protect you.
hey. - Hey. - What are you doing here?<eos> I've been waiting to talk to you. It...<eos> It really is me.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm not gonna hurt you. which means he's going to be pulling around the corner any second he's also my guard.
What?<eos> No.<eos> Can we finally talk?<eos> Okay. and I can touch one button and have a guard here.<eos> I'm not gonna hurt you.
- It's Danny.<eos> - Who?<eos> Danny.<eos> you met me at the park. Uh...<eos> I looked you up at your dojo.
No.<eos> They've got me on all kinds of drugs.<eos> Why?<eos> To keep me safe.<eos> Didn't expect to see you.
You don't understand that...<eos> If you just do things my way, it'll all work out for you, Ward.<eos> Can't you see that?<eos> Danny has nowhere else to go, but to come to us.<eos> So I'm asking you, when he reappears, keep him safe... until I decide what to do with him.
That it's my destiny.<eos> 'Cause if you really believe that you can take these sons of bitches out... then I have to believe, too.<eos> But going against them on your own, that's some foolish bullshit, no matter who you are.<eos> He's not alone.<eos> I can't ask anything more from you.
Or did you come here to destroy the Hand?<eos> - Is that why you're here?<eos> - I don't think he knows why he's here.<eos> He's just a little boy chasing girls.<eos> The enemy will try and divide you.
This is my purpose.<eos> No room for doubt.<eos> Finish it.<eos> Finish it now.<eos> You belong to me... and I command you.
I swear on the lives of my children, I have nothing to do with Danny Rand.<eos> Harold, we have a problem.<eos> You killed them.<eos> What choice did I have?<eos> They were going to kill you, Danny.
Hey, don't play her game.<eos> That's what she wants.<eos> Time isn't on our side.<eos> Look how out of control this has already gotten.<eos> What I had to do to protect you.
I'm almost ready to wrap these guys up.<eos> - Then you can put 'em in your car.<eos> - You said you needed me.<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> You called me in the middle of the night to dump bodies for you?
For your work ethic, your commitment to the code, and, most importantly, honoring and protecting your fellow classmates.<eos> You're part of something bigger than yourself now, Darryl.<eos> And that will make you stronger.<eos> A single arrow is easily broken... but not ten in a bundle.<eos> I came to warn you.
Now, if you had run away, run away like a scared child, you would have regretted it every day for the rest of your life.<eos> Now, relax.<eos> You just had a moment of weakness.<eos> Eh, it happens.<eos> I'm not gonna punish you for it.
You need to leave your mom's place right now.<eos> Gao may be sending people to hurt you.<eos> Call me or Colleen as soon as you get this.<eos> Harold?<eos> The hell is wrong with you?
Anjao... Anzhou.<eos> Anzhou. Right.<eos> What if Gao just said that she knew your father so you'd take the bait?<eos> Maybe they never even met.<eos> You can't believe anything that she says to you.
You can't believe anything that she says to you.<eos> Look, that may be true.<eos> But if there's even the smallest chance that I can find out the truth, then I have to go.<eos> Otherwise, it's just gonna be this cloud hanging over me for the rest of my life.<eos> Well, there is no rest of your life if she kills you.
Are you suggesting that I'm somehow responsible for this shitty scheme?<eos> I've known for a while that you... indulged in the extra back pill.<eos> You always seemed to have it under control.<eos> But I wanted the file in case it ever caused problems at Rand.<eos> And this wasn't a problem for you until it was a problem for Rand?
I just have no idea who you've been seeing, or what you've been reading, or... anything about your life outside of Rand.<eos> We didn't used to be like this.<eos> One day, you just put up a wall, and I never understood why.<eos> Did I do something?<eos> I was protecting you.
Do you understand?<eos> Whatever it is.<eos> Just tell me.<eos> I can't.<eos> Well then, I guess I'll just tell you something I've been keeping from you.
I suspect our guests may be from a bit further away.<eos> Go and find out.<eos> Find Claire.<eos> I'm gonna go after Gao.<eos> She's expecting you.
- You'll see.<eos> Why are you being so mysterious?<eos> I want you to know everything I've been keeping from you.<eos> But unless you see it with your own eyes, you may not believe me.<eos> What I'm about to show you is shocking, but it...
What are you doing?<eos> Come on.<eos> No. Not till you explain this.<eos> The truth is... I'm having financial trouble.<eos> I brought you here to ask you for money, but you're making me feel like an asshole, so forget about it.
Tell me what I want to know.<eos> Or what?<eos> - Danny!<eos> - Wait a minute.<eos> Can I talk to you for a minute?
Just... get Gao.<eos> You're gonna run out of time.<eos> - Did you get everything?<eos> If I give her too much, she'll fall asleep.<eos> If I give her too little, she'll resist you.
But you wouldn't let the hospice nurse do it.<eos> You were so thin... and fragile.<eos> You were like parchment.<eos> I was afraid they might break you.<eos> And sometimes... sometimes I'd wake up... and I'd see you there, asleep in the chair... and you'd be looking just like you were when you were kids.
And sometimes... sometimes I'd wake up... and I'd see you there, asleep in the chair... and you'd be looking just like you were when you were kids.<eos> So peaceful.<eos> And in that darkness, I'd pray.<eos> I would plead to the universe that if I... if I ever had a second chance, I'd do anything.<eos> I would do anything, I'd pay any price, to keep you away.
And in that darkness, I'd pray.<eos> I would plead to the universe that if I... if I ever had a second chance, I'd do anything.<eos> I would do anything, I'd pay any price, to keep you away.<eos> Keep you away from that pain and that heartache.<eos> I wanted to protect you from suffering, because you'd endured so much already.
Why are you frowning?<eos> I'm not.<eos> But you are.<eos> Our bodies always give away our inner truth.<eos> Release whatever's binding you.
A well-functioning organization focused on the common good, or... something else?<eos> Rand isn't what you hoped it would be.<eos> But you are just the person who can turn it around.<eos> I'm sure of it.<eos> What I'm about to show you is something that's been kept secret for decades.
Danny?<eos> Uh, I've been meaning to call.<eos> What's up?<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> Well, Danny, I have someone here who wants to speak with you.
It's so simple, you know.<eos> A powerful man, stressed by a life and a job that simply overwhelmed him.<eos> You go out a tortured hero. None of this comes to light.<eos> You better get the hell out of here.<eos> I don't know what you're up to, but I can tell you right now that I will never...
How much longer until the, uh, system reboots?<eos> Two minutes, thirty.<eos> Well, make sure you get the fingerprints and the gunpowder residue right.<eos> I guess you better hurry.<eos> Lei Kung sent me to bring you home.
I'm not sure I can explain.<eos> You owe me an answer.<eos> The people of K'un-Lun need to know why they were abandoned.<eos> And what about the people here?<eos> The ones who were just trying to kill you?
I can save Danny, too.<eos> He doesn't understand the good we're doing.<eos> - I can make him see.<eos> - The time for understanding is over.<eos> He sees you as one of us and that is all he will ever see.
Thanks.<eos> No, I was gonna say some sleep.<eos> You were up all night.<eos> After these past few weeks, constantly feeling like I'm drowning, it's like I know what I'm doing again. I'm back in control.<eos> We're gonna get you free, Dad.
- Danny told you.<eos> - So it's true?<eos> You're in the Hand.<eos> I need to talk to him.<eos> I don't know that he wants to talk to you.
Right.<eos> This was a mistake.<eos> Wait.<eos> Look, I don't wanna attack you just because my feelings are hurt.<eos> I just spent the last hour defending you to Danny.
Wait.<eos> Look, I don't wanna attack you just because my feelings are hurt.<eos> I just spent the last hour defending you to Danny.<eos> I told him that I thought you were a good person, no matter what.<eos> So if I let you in... what are you gonna tell him?
Am I your sensei or not?<eos> No, of course.<eos> Whatever you need.<eos> The Hand always comes first.<eos> It's good to have you back, Danny.
Whatever you need.<eos> The Hand always comes first.<eos> It's good to have you back, Danny.<eos> He told me everything.<eos> We were just trying to protect you.
If Danny can do it, why can't I?<eos> Even if we have to murder people to do it?<eos> Whatever it takes, Joy.<eos> So... are we ready to turn off the Hand's accounts?<eos> Dad, I just got you back.
Sometimes I get these... these flashes.<eos> It's like a... a fire burning inside of me.<eos> Every time it happens, it... it gets harder and harder to control.<eos> Did you ever think that maybe this turmoil you're in is because you questioned Lei Kung's teachings?<eos> If you'd just followed the path he laid out for you, none of this would be happening.
The way to K'un-Lun was open.<eos> I could leave.<eos> I was looking for a sign... and instead, it showed me a path.<eos> Maybe it is a sign.<eos> A sign telling you, Danny, that the path is open.
And look what a mess you've made here.<eos> I've seen this world.<eos> I'm... I'm not sure it's worth fighting for.<eos> Come home.<eos> Danny, what is keeping you here?
Danny, what is keeping you here?<eos> Wait, we have to wait for Bakuto.<eos> Whoa!<eos> Colleen, wait!<eos> - I'm not here to hurt you.
- No.<eos> He's always been a bastard to me.<eos> Ever since he... came back from the dead, it's like a...<eos> It's like a piece of his soul got left in the grave.<eos> He will use you, hurt you, and throw you aside without a second thought.
I'll help you become what you were meant to be.<eos> I don't even know what I'm meant be.<eos> How are you gonna help?<eos> I kind of got this feeling you're not allowed to kill me.<eos> That doesn't mean I won't do what it takes to subdue you.
You are nothing but a betrayer.<eos> You have no honor.<eos> I should have recognized you were too weak to be Hand.<eos> Deep in your soul, you know that you are nothing more than a teacher of children at a dojo that I gave you.<eos> He's trying to draw you out.
- Danny, we do what we came to do.<eos> - Is this really who you want to be?<eos> A living weapon?<eos> An assassin for K'un-Lun?<eos> Is that what your father had in mind for you when he was raising you to be Danny Rand?
Yield!<eos> Danny!<eos> I hurt you.<eos> I get it.<eos> It was selfish and wrong of me to leave without telling you.
Why would I have gone to such trouble to hide it with a plane crash?<eos> It was someone much more treacherous than I.<eos> In fact, I tried to talk him out of it, as I thought it would draw too much unwanted attention.<eos> She is playing mind games.<eos> She's trying to get you on her side.
He texted you to warn you about the DEA, right?<eos> Hey.<eos> You're looking better.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I don't want to see you right now.
Then leave.<eos> I'm sorry about what happened.<eos> Which part? When you tried to kill Dad, or when you failed to do it?<eos> I'm sorry that you got hurt.<eos> I swear I was trying to protect you.
Whatever he's saying about me, he is lying.<eos> - I haven't seen him. - Hey, don't protect him, Joy.<eos> - That is exactly what he wants. - Dad, look.<eos> He's...<eos> He is trying to turn you against me, just like he did with Ward.
Let's get ready for him.<eos> Dad, no.<eos> This way!<eos> There he is!<eos> You move, and I'll hit you again.
I look back on my life now, and I think that's my greatest regret.<eos> That I didn't kill Wendell then... before you were even born.<eos> Oh, you destroyed my family!<eos> You're wrong, Harold!<eos> The funny part is that now I'm gonna kill you.
I kayak.<eos> We could've kayaked together.<eos> Nothing on your profile about kayaking, no smiles, no ratings, no posts?<eos> I'm no psychologist, but this behavior sometimes stems from low self-worth.<eos> This is what participation is all about, bringing you, lifting you up...
In the lobby?<eos> I- are you okay?<eos> - No, I'm really not okay.<eos> Why didn't you call, send a text?<eos> Because I wanted to see you in person. I wanted to look you in the eyes.
He once killed three men in a bar... With a pencil.<eos> I know.<eos> I've heard the story. With a fucking pencil!<eos> Who the fuck can do that?<eos> Well, I can assure you... that the stories you hear about this man,
Maybe his glasses?<eos> My hands.<eos> How exciting.<eos> Yet you know you cannot, can you?<eos> I told you, I needed that guy, the way you are looking at me right now.
That's downright upright of you, Mr. Wick.<eos> You sound positively magnanimous.<eos> But look around you.<eos> How much help does it look like I need?<eos> It seems to me that the real question, Mr. Wick, is who in this cruel world of ours, is going to help you?
Within this exhibition, the interplay of light and the nature of self-images coalesce to provide an experience which will highlight the fragility of our perception of space and our place within it.<eos> We hope through this exhibit we can provide new insights into your understanding of the world, and just possibly lead you to deeper reflection into the nature of self.<eos> The marker is complete, John.<eos> You should have just run away.<eos> You know what the Camorra will do to you.
High Table?<eos> And the Continental?<eos> You killed a man on company grounds, Jonathan.<eos> You leave me no choice but to declare you excommunicado.<eos> The doors to any service or provider in connection with the Continental are now closed to you.
He didn't tell me a lot of things.<eos> - You know what? Let me call the girls.<eos> - No!<eos> We can put something aside for you under the radar, maybe open a little shop in town or get a place in Tahoe.<eos> You don't have any kids, you could just start over where nobody knows you.
I mean, what could she possibly be up to now?<eos> Hey, there.<eos> You must be one of those guys they're looking for.<eos> What are you doing? What are you doing out here?<eos> I'm not gonna hurt you.
I'll be right back.<eos> Anastasia.<eos> It was you, wasn't it?<eos> You just went and bought all of these?<eos> I don't like strangers gawking at you.
You put money into my account that... I don't want it.<eos> You bought the company i work for.<eos> This isn't a relationship, Christian.<eos> It's ownership.<eos> I'm trying to understand you.
It's ownership.<eos> I'm trying to understand you.<eos> Lam just wanting to get close to you.<eos> But it's really difficult to do that when you keep doing bizarre things like this.<eos> And it's really difficult to do that when you won't let me touch you.
Look, I know she scared you...<eos> Yeah.<eos> She scared me.<eos> But you scared me more.<eos> Seeing you like that with her.
Look at me.<eos> Look at me.<eos> I'm scared.<eos> I know you say that I'm enough.<eos> But there are certain things that you are used to getting that I will never, ever, ever be able to give you.
Women who look like you...<eos> Like your mother.<eos> Yes.<eos> And I know how fucked up that is.<eos> When you left, I swore that I would stop it if that's what it took to get you back.
I'm sorry. Work has been so crazy.<eos> I hope they're not overworking you?<eos> No, no.<eos> It's actually... It's going really well.<eos> Um, but I was calling because I, um... i wanted to talk to you about Christian.
Happy birthday.<eos> Thank you.<eos> And Ana.<eos> Hi.<eos> It's so good to see you again.
Thank you.<eos> Ana, let me introduce to you, my good friend, Elena Lincoln.<eos> We met at the masquerade.<eos> Yes.<eos> Nice to see you again.
No rock.<eos> Christian grey.<eos> Oh, my god!<eos> I have a sister!<eos> I leave you alone for a couple weeks, and this is what happens?
Give me your hand.<eos> Did you do that?<eos> Great, isn't it?<eos> That's so pretty.<eos> I solemnly vow to love you faithfully and to keep you safe for as long as we both shall live.
Where are you gonna go?<eos> You're kidding, right?<eos> Oh, he's not kidding.<eos> Oh, boy.<eos> Should I remind you what happened to those who tried?
Hey, don't you have an oasis to watch?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I'll leave you with your family.<eos> And sorry for the inconvenience.<eos> How many times do I have to tell you?
-I didn't choose this.<eos> -Even better. It chose you.<eos> Destiny brought us together.<eos> It's fate.<eos> No one is going to come rescue you, sweetie.
Are they sure?<eos> I've just rung her. She's not answering.<eos> Do you think I should go round?<eos> I dunno.<eos> If she's not answering to you, she probably wants to be on her own.
While I was waiting, a cockroach this big tried to steal my shoe.<eos> Yeah. They'll take a shoe.<eos> Honestly, this?<eos> This godforsaken mosquito ranch was a conscious choice?<eos> I could drop you back off at the airport.
I see. Fine.<eos> Well, I'm not leaving without her.<eos> Well, welcome to Florida.<eos> Frank, please listen to reason.<eos> At some point, either you're gonna come to the conclusion, or someone in authority is going to spell it out for you that the child's best interest is all that matters.
If I was the dad of a little girl and I never saw her... and I was in the same town...<eos> I would visit her.<eos> Well, I hope you're happy.<eos> He didn't even need directions.<eos> He could've followed you here.
What if I didn't use a sword?<eos> Fighting does not make you a hero.<eos> Just the shield then, no sharp edges.<eos> Diana, you are the most precious thing in the world to me.<eos> I wished for you so much, so I sculpted you from clay myself.
That's not Charlie.<eos> That's Charlie.<eos> Steven!<eos> May God grow a flower upon your head son.<eos> Good to see you.
Avoid sneak attack, chief!<eos> How are you?<eos> - Good to see you pal.<eos> - Big mike.<eos> - Good to see you.
- Good to see you pal.<eos> - Big mike.<eos> - Good to see you.<eos> - Oh yes!<eos> Good to see you my friend.
Maybe, Maybe we don't!<eos> But it's not about that.<eos> It's about what you believe.<eos> You don't think I get it, after what I've seen out there?<eos> You don't think I wish I could tell you that I was one bad guy to blame?
They do not deserve your protection!<eos> It's not about deserving.<eos> It's about what you believe.<eos> And I believe in love.<eos> Then I will destroy you!
Look at that smile<eos> I love it when you smile.<eos> Make me happy.<eos> I think this place makes you happy.<eos> It's like it speaks to you.
I know.<eos> I'd love to play games.<eos> Beaten the bests alone.<eos> I'm kinda in a rush, so if you got something to say...<eos> Oh this is a very different game that I can assure you.
Did you have to cross two blocks to go get your cuban coffee?<eos> So, what is it?<eos> Black, no sugar?<eos> Yeah..<eos> I've put a lot of work into getting you here in today.
Well, well, well...<eos> Luke Hobbs behind bars.<eos> Would you look at that?<eos> The band cop got it's day.<eos> You know, that color looks good on you.
He's still..<eos> Yes, like first baby shit.<eos> Yes, we've tried those location... ..wanna mobilize.<eos> Let's get a hold of a, better asshole.<eos> No one respects you, over.
It scrambles your senses.<eos> Don't worry, It'll wear off in an hour.<eos> Probably.<eos> Hello, Deckard.<eos> Nice to see you again.
I simply made one but so did you.<eos> You could have stopped me, but you chose not to do.<eos> I wonder what Letty thought about that.<eos> The problem of putting your foot on a Tiger's neck... is you can never let it up.<eos> I think I need to remind you why you chose to be here.
Look here man.<eos> Before I throw up in my mouth...<eos> Let me ask you what are we doing here?<eos> That's a good question, Roman.<eos> Let me show you.
- You know who I am?<eos> - That's why I'm here.<eos> You know what I'm capable of.<eos> It's why I'm here.<eos> I'll give you until I finish my cup up.
You know, you can tell this in another letter..<eos> But maybe we could've caused some serious damage.<eos> - Yes, we could have.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Shame I'll have to punch you, head of defend, when this is all over.
They are off the grid.<eos> Probably just bunker down somewhere.<eos> Closing in on him.<eos> You guys ready?<eos> One thing I can guarantee you Dom.
This...<eos> This is for my son!<eos> Dom!<eos> You are out of bullets Deckard.<eos> Like I'm need a gun to take care of you,
You know I've never left you, Letty?<eos> I know.<eos> And you know I never will..<eos> I know.<eos> I've so much to tell you.
All this fuss of you.<eos> Yes.<eos> Alena, I promise to keep our son safe.<eos> And now.. he always will be.<eos> I want to introduce you to the most important person in my universe.
I can't believe you're already in tenth grade.<eos> It's like time has flown by and stood still all at the same time.<eos> It's usually a father's hope that his son will follow in his footsteps.<eos> Thankfully, that won't be the case with us.<eos> I never meant to hurt you, Josh... but I have failed you in every way possible.

No, wait.<eos> Don't do anything yet.<eos> Code four.<eos> Looks like two of you will be leaving the block today, Money.<eos> Let me get you outta here.
Let me get you outta here.<eos> This fucking mess will take all day.<eos> Your gate money, 200, and your CDCR ID.<eos> Use it until you get a new driver's license.<eos> The van outside will take you to the train station.
Welcome home, brother.<eos> - Jason Horvath.<eos> It's an honor.<eos> How about the name Chef, huh?<eos> Name mean anything to you?
Fuck!<eos> This ride clean?<eos> Insurance is up to date, reg, everything.<eos> I need it tonight.<eos> Tell me where to drop you off. I'll pull over here.
Wait, wait.<eos> You're telling me there's just 900 now.<eos> No. There was 11 hundred to start.<eos> I figured a hundred was pretty cheap to get them home but then again we're talking about Soviet factory full-autos, not that cheap-ass Chinese knock-off bullshit.<eos> He said he needed to see you, Money.
Just breathe.<eos> Fish has heart.<eos> Get on the wall.<eos> Step in.<eos> You throw any piss or shit... I'll leave you in here for the whole 30, no rec.
Yeah, the stock broker from Pasadena.<eos> When you come to yard, chow, you take a shit, whatever... you stick to your own race.<eos> Why did you fight that Toad?<eos> He challenged me first.<eos> You gonna go around kicking it off with every buster that calls you out?
Everyone puts in work, whether cliqued up or not.<eos> I understand.<eos> I'm not talking about helping us with our computer skills.<eos> You'll get your fucking hands dirty like the rest of us.<eos> Or you can go back to seeing how that lone bullshit works out for you, money man.
Hey.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Joshua made you a letter... and he's very excited for you to read it.<eos> He did it all by himself, and...<eos> I wanted to give it to you, but some guard up front took it.
How is he?<eos> He's really good.<eos> Sorry.<eos> - It's okay.<eos> It's good to see you.
- Fuck, yeah.<eos> Damn, I can't be part of a riot.<eos> Don't expect a hall pass, brother.<eos> Whole wood pile's expected to get down.<eos> Just don't go anywhere the cops or cameras can single you out.
But keep your ink clean so they can't validate you.<eos> That's how we lull the enemy to sleep.<eos> I understand.<eos> You have the keys out here now.<eos> Roberts will single-cell you.
The fuck you mean he's been calling? He ain't been calling-Oh, fuck!<eos> What you tell Kutcher?<eos> Does Herman know you're a rat?<eos> Fucking stupid motherfucker!<eos> Herman's the one who tried to kill you, you fuck!
Same as I told you!<eos> You lie to me again, I'll blow your fucking head off! How many?<eos> Two.<eos> Two thousand AKs.<eos> Shotgun, right before I met you, Shotgun said that if I said anything about the extra guns, he'd green-light me, Money.
- Got nothing to play. - Come on, Harlon.<eos> Don't let your pride get in the way.<eos> You don't owe these people... - Save the speech.<eos> We're done here.<eos> What happens when we put you in Death Row with all the low-lifes for murdering Shotgun?
Easy.<eos> Easy, Money.<eos> Slowly.<eos> What the fuck, Money?<eos> You knew they'd put you back here.
- Okay!<eos> Uh, thank you for sharing, John. - All right, you got it.<eos> - Nola? Hey, Nola?<eos> - Are you following me?<eos> No, no, no, I'm not following you.
- Are you following me?<eos> No, no, no, I'm not following you.<eos> No, no, don't mace me!<eos> I'm not a stalker.<eos> I I am technically following you, but not in a stalker way just as a professional... strictly professional.
No, no, no, I'm not following you.<eos> No, no, don't mace me!<eos> I'm not a stalker.<eos> I I am technically following you, but not in a stalker way just as a professional... strictly professional.<eos> Look, your brothers hired my boss to find you and that's where I come in.
I'm not a stalker.<eos> I I am technically following you, but not in a stalker way just as a professional... strictly professional.<eos> Look, your brothers hired my boss to find you and that's where I come in.<eos> They want you to come home, okay, they miss you.<eos> I could drive you, at least to my boss' house.
And, uh, you'll be home in no time.<eos> Send her up.<eos> There he is.<eos> Steve's a great guy.<eos> All right, well, pleasure to meet you. - You, too.
Aren't you tired of this Peter Pan bullshit?<eos> This is no kind of life, you're an old man.<eos> Why don't you just meet somebody your own age and make a life, for God sakes?<eos> - I will.<eos> - You know, someday, Steve one of these guys is gonna catch you and what are you gonna do then?
I'll sell you the house back.<eos> - My parent's house?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You'll sell it back to me?<eos> At the same price they sold it to you for?
Now, normally by this time, Steve's already had about eight cups of coffee... and he doesn't really handle the caffeine all that well.<eos> So, a little secret between you and I is I switched the brew in our office with decaf, you know, to take the edge off.<eos> John. Have you seen a picture around here, a picture of my house?<eos> - Wow, this is good coffee.<eos> - Uh the Samoans called looking for you.
Go knock on the door.<eos> How ya doin'?<eos> I'm okay.<eos> How are you?<eos> You know that I think of you as a son.
I'm okay.<eos> How are you?<eos> You know that I think of you as a son.<eos> I did not know that, but thank you.<eos> I guess I feel like, sometimes I think of you as a father in a way...
- This is Taylor.<eos> - Who's Taylor? Hold on.<eos> Hey, honey, hi, how are you doing?<eos> - Uncle Steve.<eos> - I want you right now.
- Why you asking?<eos> You a cop?<eos> No, no, I'm not a cop.<eos> No, no, no, I'm just a friend, I'm just looking for her.<eos> She messing with you, too?
I just said your name.<eos> Yeah, I'm sorry, I remember you, I'm just...<eos> I'm not used to people remembering me.<eos> Well, how could I forget a guy who followed me down a dark alley?<eos> I should have finished the job, killed you there.
- Knuckle duster?<eos> - Ninja throwing star?<eos> You sure you want to do this?<eos> What else have I got to do?<eos> I'm with you.
- Fuck you! - Hey, Manu?<eos> Just... please.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Listen, we are here to apologize to you, Steve for kicking the shit out of you.
In the end, he was calling for you.<eos> I know.<eos> I'd say, "Come on, come in.<eos> Before the tide gets your shoes."<eos> And he would light these fires on the shore, call out your name and talk to you.
Nootka was my mother's tribe.<eos> Your mother came from Naples.<eos> He bought some land and he bought a wife.<eos> And he bought them both for gunpowder.<eos> He told me never to speak to you of buying her.
When he lit his fires on the foreshore.<eos> Nothing you could tell me about that man would surprise me.<eos> He was half human at the end and he would squat right here and make deals with ghosts in the flames.<eos> And he would speak in a language that was like... It was like ravens fighting.<eos> And he would talk to you, James.
Be punctual.<eos> - They've brought the carriage up.<eos> - Yes.<eos> I'm coming.<eos> You're not imploring him to relinquish his deed, you're insisting that, for his own welfare, he submit his claim to you.
So I says to the gentleman...<eos> "I sailed with old Horace all around the world."<eos> See?<eos> So I said, "You go or I'll slit your gizzard"<eos> "and drop you in the current you had planned with Captain Delaney."
From the conversation, he meant to do you harm, and the mistress knew it.<eos> She wants you dead, so she can have her rooms back.<eos> How old are you?<eos> 13.<eos> Why would she keep you and not rent you?
Thank you.<eos> What was this ship?<eos> What was this ship?<eos> Me and you.<eos> See you..
Tonight, composer Ludwig van Beethoven's Sixth Symphony.<eos> James, please, don't.<eos> What?<eos> I missed you.<eos> I couldn't bear to see you alone.
In that event, it would be potatoes, wouldn't it?<eos> Simple sustenance.<eos> Life goes on.<eos> Before you drink any more, could you tell me what happened?<eos> But in the event... of a messenger coming to tell you that he had killed me, well, champagne!
Apart from rats and river water, sir.<eos> Keep looking!<eos> Carry on.<eos> You've had a fall.<eos> You probably don't remember who you are, so let me remind you.
Your husband reports a Barbason has been visiting you.<eos> There is a ceremony of exorcism which can eradicate the Barbason.<eos> It's a very short process.<eos> And quite inexpensive.<eos> I told the Priest how he visits you.
There is a ceremony of exorcism which can eradicate the Barbason.<eos> It's a very short process.<eos> And quite inexpensive.<eos> I told the Priest how he visits you.<eos> - He visits you. He visits you.
- Why burden him?<eos> Please understand that, from this moment, I will burn your letters without opening them.<eos> Then I will visit you in your dreams.<eos> James...<eos> I told the Priest how he visits you.
Your man did not heed my warning...<eos> You don't want much, do you?<eos> You were meant to be guarding his ship.<eos> Two possibilities.<eos> He sold you out, cos you cut off his thumb, or you cut off his thumb, cos you knew he was going to sell you out.
He's been there all day, either mad or sick or drunk.<eos> We knocked.<eos> He won't answer.<eos> Brace, you are not sick and you are not dead yet.<eos> Come out, or I will come in there and drag you out.
No, no, no.<eos> Look... go to this address, all right?<eos> There will be a man with markings on his face to meet you... he will take you to my friend Atticus.<eos> Tell my friend Atticus where Helga is.<eos> Write your account... he will secure it and keep you safe.
There will be a man with markings on his face to meet you... he will take you to my friend Atticus.<eos> Tell my friend Atticus where Helga is.<eos> Write your account... he will secure it and keep you safe.<eos> Safe? Safe?<eos> When my ship is ready, I will send for you.
Spoken for, Sir.<eos> Dear, God.<eos> Spoken for, Sir.<eos> You haven't changed a bit, Godders.<eos> I need to speak to you.
I honestly mean you no harm, Godders.<eos> - If I were caught...<eos> - What?<eos> If I were caught passing company secrets to a Delaney...<eos> You're not going to get caught because I will protect you.
And there was I thinking that we were just brothers in arms.<eos> Didn't we share a bed sometimes in the great hall?<eos> It was torture.<eos> Exquisite.<eos> So you can trust me... and I will protect you.
I used to think we were the same person.<eos> We are.<eos> We're not.<eos> Now...<eos> I never want to see you again.
But you could allow your cunt to swallow the work of an honest man, who will promise to buy you the finest china... if you just agree to stop fucking bleeding.<eos> - Oranges, madam.<eos> - She doesn't want fucking oranges!<eos> We all know what she wants.<eos> How like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony's nephew?
Uh, 10-17, copy that.<eos> Hello, carl.<eos> Maggie, I got shelly briggs Here in the truck with me.<eos> Could you patch us through to deputy briggs?<eos> Hold on, please. I'll put you through.
Maggie, I got shelly briggs Here in the truck with me.<eos> Could you patch us through to deputy briggs?<eos> Hold on, please. I'll put you through.<eos> Shelly.<eos> Thanks, norma, I'll call you back.
And he spent everything you ever gave me, anyway.<eos> I'll loan you the money.<eos> But you gotta pay me back.<eos> And you gotta make this right.<eos> And we have to get you out of that trailer And away from him.
Uh... N-no, no.<eos> He's not... Like that.<eos> Come on.<eos> I hope you're right.<eos> From now on, if he ever touches you Or breaks the law in any way,
I'm gonna bring him down.<eos> Look... Becky, We know that you're a grown, married woman.<eos> But we're your parents.<eos> And we love you.<eos> And... we just... we don't want to lose you.
Oh, my god!<eos> I love this guy!<eos> Dougie?<eos> Dougie jones.<eos> What a pleasure to meet you.
I like it on the rocks.<eos> Well, you're in luck.<eos> The Dakotas are still in the Ice Age.<eos> Diane, we know your work with Agent Cooper has given you more than a passing insight into the Blue Rose.<eos> Even though you're no longer a part of the bureau, we'd like to deputize you. On a temporary basis, because we really need your help.
Really?<eos> Oh, my goodness.<eos> Thank you, Tina.<eos> Great.<eos> I'll talk to you soon.
Previously on "Pretty Little Liars..."<eos> - Can I talk to you?
Um, she had to reschedule.<eos> Between the two of us, we have to know someone who knows someone who can take care of her.<eos> Claire, are you okay?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Is Addison bullying you?
Why would you bring her to my rehearsal dinner?<eos> I'm sorry, okay?<eos> I didn't know what else to do.<eos> Caleb doesn't wanna leave Mona home alone and it's hard to find a sitter for someone in their mid 20s.<eos> Hanna, the last time we saw Mona she tried to push you off the bell tower.
- Hi, Miss Fields.<eos> Hi. Well, can I talk to you, ladies?<eos> - We're working. - Okay.<eos> Well, you can tell your boss we're talkin' about Rumaki spheres.<eos> Look, Willa, I've known you since you volunteered at the Y.
You want company?<eos> I told you I'd give it a try.<eos> Yeah, that was like six years ago.<eos> Well, maybe I just took some time to get used to the idea.<eos> I meant to congratulate you on winning the game.
- Yeah. - We have to...<eos> We have to make a couple of extra stops.<eos> - Hey. - I call shotgun.<eos> Watch it.<eos> I know it's none of my business, but... don't take for granted the people who love you the most just because they sometimes let you.
And when the game was over, I went back to London.<eos> But I just...<eos> I couldn't stop thinkin' about you.<eos> About how good you have it.<eos> About how much your friends love you.
- Thank you.<eos> My God, are you crying too?<eos> I'm just...<eos> I'm so happy to be here with all of you.<eos> Celebrating you, Aria.
I don't know.<eos> She gave me something to sleep and the next thing I knew, I woke up here.<eos> But you're safe, Spencer.<eos> She promised me.<eos> And in time, you'll earn her trust and she'll let you out of your room.
She ran away from the Ambrose Home for wayward children on her tenth birthday.<eos> A year before I found out she was there.<eos> Can you imagine how alone she must have felt?<eos> Yeah, I can.<eos> There is nothing more that I would love than to hold you, Spencer but she would never forgive me if you got out.
Look, he's right.<eos> You don't have to do this.<eos> Look, you became A.D. because of Charlotte.<eos> I understand that and my friends will too.<eos> Okay, they'll forgive you just like we forgave Mona.
So then what's gonna happen now?<eos> You can't just keep me here forever.<eos> Of course, I can.<eos> And you have Mary to thank for that.<eos> She saved you at the blind school and she's saving you now.
She doesn't know who I am, but she offered to help me and I kept my promise.<eos> I paid for her surgery.<eos> She's still as blind as a bat and useless to me.<eos> What about Sara Harvey?<eos> Was she looking for you too?
She's just a doll to me.<eos> I have to go.<eos> I'm gonna miss my flight.<eos> No, I'll drive you.<eos> It'll be too hard to say goodbye to you.
- Did you...?<eos> No, but you're sweet to think I did. - Well, you look fabulous.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Hi, Jackie.<eos> Good to see you.
I don't know where Ziggy went. He's with Chloe.<eos> He's fine. - Hi, Madeline!<eos> - Renata!<eos> Hi, hi!<eos> - So good to see you. You look adorable.
- Are you following this?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And, like, I look at you, and you're so beautiful.<eos> - That's true. - Stop.<eos> And I'm not saying that to embarrass you at all, but it is true.
Like you used to be? - Maddie.<eos> - Like we used to be?<eos> - Maddie, hi. - Hi.<eos> I heard you're working at the community theater.<eos> I wanted to talk to you about the petition thing, about the play.
I agree, but now we are, so maybe the child needs to take responsibility for his actions.<eos> And he needs to see there are consequences.<eos> Little boys don't get to go around anymore hurting little girls.<eos> And none of us want to raise bullies, so we don't have to pretend we didn't do it.<eos> It's okay. I believe you.
Because someone might come looking for it, and I don't want it to get lost.<eos> You know what your memory's like.<eos> I can't help it.<eos> I know, sweetheart.<eos> Just do what I'm telling you, okay?
I spend 24/7 in this house looking after you, feeding you, bolstering your moods, doing your laundry.<eos> I can't leave!<eos> I can't go anywhere!<eos> I'm going nuts here!<eos> I literally gave up my life to protect you.
I got my IUD taken out for Miami.<eos> Is that a good idea?<eos> Yeah. It's your bachelorette weekend.<eos> Jess, Wesson tweeted out another dick pic, and it's already got 10,000 retweets.<eos> Alice, I got to call you back.
- Let's go, let's do it.<eos> Drive safe. Have fun at your bachelor party, okay?<eos> Will do.<eos> Hey, Alice, be careful swimming in all that dick.<eos> I'm so happy to see you.
But if anybody from the group disappears from the protest, you text my cell phone immediately.<eos> You have a cell phone?<eos> - No.<eos> - You're one of them!<eos> I'll pick you up after school on Monday, okay, sweetie?
What, are you flirting with me?<eos> I would not flirt with a happily married woman who broke my heart.<eos> Oh, my God, you broke up with me, don't even start with that.<eos> Excuse me, now you are flirting with me, okay?<eos> It's good to see you.
- Hey, Alice, how's your mom?<eos> - Well, Alzheimer's is tough, but she's good. Good.<eos> The Wallace 5th Floor Girls are back together again!<eos> God, when was the last time we were all together?<eos> I think it was two summers ago when we came to visit you in your tree, right?
- Thank you. This marriage, will it be open?<eos> You know, we haven't discussed it. But, probably closed.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Tightly, tightly closed.<eos> Lea, does she not remind you of our French girl from Turks and Caicos?
Check.<eos> Just, anyone, a check.<eos> A chair.<eos> A chair.<eos> I'm so excited to see you. It's been so long.
Hey, it's Blair.<eos> Don't leave a message.<eos> Okay. That's it. None of them are picking up.<eos> That means something really bad happened.<eos> Dude, this is, like, the third girlfriend that's cheated on you.
We're really sorry.<eos> - You deserved better.<eos> There's nothing we could do to bring you back, but...<eos> We promise to spend the rest of our lives trying to be better people.<eos> We owe that to you.
Now we have a dead guy and an unconscious cop?<eos> - What is wrong with you?<eos> - Are you kidding me? He's obviously a rape cop.<eos> This is what they do!<eos> When they have dirt on you, they sexually assault you, knowing you won't report it.
So, still a no-go on the BJ, or...<eos> No, I'm good.<eos> Thanks.<eos> That's fine.<eos> Actually, there's somebody I want to introduce you to.
The only thing that's changed is you.<eos> You've become obsessed with your perfect new life and your campaign and you ditched me.<eos> I am sorry that I don't want to talk about the time that we got drunk at O'Flaherty's 10 years ago!<eos> Well, you know what?<eos> I guess I never should have planned such a nice weekend for you.
You're an ungrateful person.<eos> You didn't plan this weekend for me.<eos> You planned this weekend for yourself, so that you could post a bunch of photos and not make your life seem so sad!<eos> I'm sorry, Jess.<eos> I'll leave you...
You didn't plan this weekend for me.<eos> You planned this weekend for yourself, so that you could post a bunch of photos and not make your life seem so sad!<eos> I'm sorry, Jess.<eos> I'll leave you...<eos> I'll leave you alone from now on.
He does not suck.<eos> You should totally marry him.<eos> - Well, I will.<eos> - Good. You should.<eos> I mean, I had a sex dream about him, and I didn't even tell you.
Do not yell at me.<eos> You're the one... honey, can you turn that down, please?<eos> Do you understand the precedent that you'd be setting?<eos> Don't yell at me.<eos> You know what? I'm a lady and I've never said this to anybody, ever, in my entire life, but I'm gonna say it to you.
Okay, I don't... I don't think this is the right time to be... let's just...<eos> - Thank you. - And if Chloe's out, then the entire brigade will follow.<eos> - She's basically the pied piper.<eos> I like you, Madeline.<eos> And... and I actually admire you for sticking up for your unapologetic friend, but if I can offer something as objectively as I possibly can... do not fuck with my daughter's birthday.
- Don't worry. - Right.<eos> - Let me call you right back. - But I...<eos> Chloe, get in the car.<eos> Chloe, get in the car right now. What?<eos> I need to talk to you.
Bye.<eos> - Stay in the car.<eos> - Ma'am! I'm just gonna be a minute.<eos> Bonnie?<eos> Bonnie, can I talk to you for just a second?
Well, I believe she's being nice to Bonnie, or at least trying under the circumstances.<eos> What circumstances would those be?<eos> Nathan, come on. It was pretty tough when you left.<eos> But that was 15 years ago.<eos> Okay, it's difficult for Madeline to see you at every school function so involved when you weren't there for Abigail.
You're kind of like today's standard-bearer for the evolved man.<eos> Like, you work at home, you... You do almost 50-50 in the childcare. You even cook.<eos> Right, so you're the guy who likes to fish and hunt, and I'm Mr. Girly-Man?<eos> - That's not what I meant at all, man.<eos> - Okay. I thought it'd be indelicate to bring it up with Maddie. That's why I'm bringing it up with you.
But I didn't get a law degree to be a damn receptionist.<eos> You'd be lucky to be someone's receptionist.<eos> If I were you, I'd start praying.<eos> How do you put up with him, Mother?<eos> The question is, how do I tolerate you?
Do I need to remind you who's holding the guns here?<eos> Everybody just needs to settle in... and try and get along.<eos> Looks like we're gonna be roommates for a few days.<eos> You don't think the police are gonna be looking for me?<eos> No, Madalyn, I don't think anyone's gonna be looking for you.
You're fine.<eos> They're treating me for nerve damage.<eos> I'm sorry. You're right.<eos> I... I understand.<eos> Probably very frightening for you, and we shouldn't have dragged Robin and Susan through all this.
I'm about to go on.<eos> Susan filed for divorce.<eos> Hallelujah.<eos> I knew it was gonna happen.<eos> I told you so, didn't I?
Well, it's not non-alcoholic wine, Diwata.<eos> I shouldn't then. I...<eos> Until I'm into a good BFA program, I need to protect my singing voice, you know?<eos> Yeah, alcohol dries out the chords.<eos> You know... someone who looks a lot like you, was checking out the family planning center, across from the pizza shop I work at last week.
If I was running things, we would have at least followed the rules.<eos> If you were running things, we never would have made it to Portland.<eos> Then I could similarly surmise that short people... are stupider than taller people, because you can't see as much as taller people, and they have smaller brain...<eos> Hey, you ain't that tall either, Solomon.<eos> - My brother's tall, and he hates you.
♪ You wanna be high for this ♪<eos> Alice: Did you sleep?<eos> Ben: Nope.<eos> Why not?<eos> Because I knew I was gonna see you this morning.
'Cause it is in my name, and that's my Social Security number.<eos> It could be an accounting error.<eos> Or identity theft, although they usually take money.<eos> They don't give it.<eos> Whoever parked this money in your name knew you well enough to think you'd never find it.
Rhys. What the... [Groans]<eos> Ooh, yeah.<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> Had to make it look realistic.<eos> How else was I gonna break you out of there?
I'm sorry. What?<eos> Well, he stabbed you just deep enough for the guards to call the ambulance, but he missed all the major organs.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Yeah, it does look a bit angry, doesn't it?<eos> Sorry. I had to stitch you up on the fly.
We just need to know if he called you.<eos> No.<eos> He did not call. You know why?<eos> Because someone with a shiv found out that he made a deal with the feds.<eos> The United States government is gonna pay you to be a criminal?
- Rhys.<eos> Did you say, "Yeah, I'd love to do that, but not without my partner Rhys"?<eos> We are no longer partners.<eos> Oh.<eos> Well, I wish I'd known that before I went to all this trouble and broke you out of jail.
And I'm gonna call the FBI.<eos> Ooh, no.<eos> We can't have that.<eos> Rhys, they're gonna think that I ran.<eos> Yeah, the thing is, in order to get you out of jail, I had to make, um certain promises.
Great. What did you do for them?<eos> I used to walk their dogs.<eos> - How'd they find you?<eos> - Uh, Craigslist, I think.<eos> And how'd they pay you?
So it's mine now, legally.<eos> Free and clear.<eos> Okay, it's not about the money anymore.<eos> It's about your life.<eos> Whoever killed the Kincaids, the minute they find out the money's in your name, they're gonna come after you.
But this money could change everything for me.<eos> I-I mean, I could go somewhere, disappear, and... and you wouldn't have to worry about me ever again.<eos> I would be worried about you every minute for the rest of my life.<eos> These people, whoever they are, they're killers.<eos> So, if they find you...
I don't know.<eos> I'll call the FBI.<eos> I'll have them freeze the money.<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> Because I'm trying to keep you alive.
I'm sorry, but you don't get points for that if you're the one that put her in there in the first place.<eos> But that's just it.<eos> She wasn't angry with me.<eos> Mum was frightened.<eos> She was having you on.
What is that?<eos> That's nothing.<eos> Rare Mangels seed.<eos> How did you find us?<eos> The man that Rhys hired to stab you used to work for Mangels.
You have the opium.<eos> This 'Akbari Afeem' isn't burning.<eos> What will I do?<eos> Smoke a joint with wild bears?<eos> On the contrary, they will fear you.
- Open it.<eos> Yes, Sergeant.<eos> What is it?<eos> Zulfi, what time is my entry on stage?<eos> I just told you.
Remember". .<eos> It's a Rusi Billimoria creation.<eos> He was my shadow.<eos> Yet I was unaware that he was working for the INA.<eos> What would you have done if he'd told you?
or him.<eos> Nawab!<eos> Nawab, you need to get out of here right now.<eos> Rusi is going to kill you.<eos> He's looking for you!
Kill me or you'll get killed.<eos> Are you even alive?<eos> Had you been, you'd have realised the tyranny of your masters.<eos> You'd have heard the screams of the innocents!<eos> I don't have to kill you.
And these are some of the players that he liked.<eos> We buried him with his hockey stick and we buried him with his number 18, his Hockey shirt from Franklin.<eos> And that went with him.<eos> My dad always said, to really get to know Rob you needed to go to the places he went, experience what he loved and see the things he built.<eos> .HeY, buddy, good to see you,
Motherfucker!<eos> I'm gonna kill you, Chacho!<eos> I just gave her the attention you didn't, bro.<eos> You should've cuddled. You should've cuddled, bro.<eos> Chacho, I'll kill you!
I mean, I was friends with TJ.<eos> All right? We were friends and I thought we'd get along too.<eos> But if you're going to be up my ass, then I'll just keep it movin'.<eos> This is my partner's widow.<eos> I see you around this house again, I will be in your ass with a boot.
Yeah, but a lot of people make twins.<eos> Yeah, but that one's revving at 9000 RPM which only a four-valve motor will do.<eos> The only four-valve twin in a supermoto setup is the Ducati.<eos> They're fast as fuck.<eos> All I wanna do in the middle of the evening is hold you tight
Most guys probably...<eos> It was my first day, so I thought you'd probably want to see what I look like.<eos> In all brown?<eos> It's great, Jon.<eos> I thought maybe it would remind you of your dad.
Take the olive branch and accept some help, okay?<eos> Come on, Ponch!<eos> Ponch, slow down.<eos> You're not good enough to ride this fast.<eos> I'd rather crash and die than talk to you.
Look, I'm sorry you crashed, man.<eos> I tried to warn you.<eos> I don't wanna talk about it.<eos> Okay.<eos> Look, man, just, real quick, I wasn't trying to embarrass you.
We just want justice for TJ. Don't you want that?<eos> So, you were just trying to keep TJ's pension?<eos> Somebody knew about TJ and Barton, and they were using that against him.<eos> We'll need your help to see who that could be.<eos> I see you around this house again, I will be in your ass with a boot.
I think it's 350.<eos> You guys kinda caught me in the middle of it.<eos> Why don't you come back in an hour and a half or so, when I'm gone?<eos> No, right now is good.<eos> We'll just shadow you.
Are you gonna lift this?<eos> You're gonna lift this.<eos> Hey, how did you know about TJ?<eos> His wife didn't even know.<eos> I can't imagine anyone trusting you with a secret.
His wife didn't even know.<eos> I can't imagine anyone trusting you with a secret.<eos> Not like that.<eos> Unless they were part of your crew.<eos> I can't imagine anyone trusting you with their life. Oh...
Over and out!<eos> Shit.<eos> Freeze!<eos> Damn it!<eos> Hey, why is he chasing you?
I'm gonna kill you.<eos> When I am healed, I am gonna physically destroy you.<eos> Get the fuck out of my room.<eos> Call Peterson.<eos> He's looking for you.
I also have a catheter in and I didn't wanna be too sexy for the staff.<eos> Mmm-hmm, yeah.<eos> Tone it down a little bit.<eos> Are you posted here?<eos> I came to see you, dummy, and just wanted to brag about saving your life.
Hi, it's Karen from SwimTech.<eos> Leave me a message.<eos> - Hey!<eos> - Oh, Ponch!<eos> Man, am I happy to see you!
I'm sorry about this.<eos> I just got my phone working.<eos> I got all your messages.<eos> Dude, I'm so happy you're here.<eos> - Good to see you, buddy.
Oh, thank God!<eos> I knew you'd come.<eos> Oh, thank God.<eos> Oh, I need your gun.<eos> I'm so happy to see you.
Why was I invited here this evening?<eos> We need nothing of you, except loyalty to your country.<eos> Have you heard the rumours that the King is unwell?<eos> You can't be thinking of trying to free him?<eos> I'm telling you, don't go back there and say, "No deal."
and I assume one of them contacted you with the plan to get the atomic calculations into American hands,<eos> and that's what you were doing, coming to collect the film that day.<eos> You're very clever, though you seemed to have confused interrogation with seduction.<eos> I hope you're not saying I had anything to do with the murder?<eos> Oh, I'd still like to seduce you but I want to know.
Glad you could trust me for something.<eos> Why didn't you tell me you were onto this Spode?<eos> You know damn well why.<eos> You trust that bloody kid Dunn more than you trust me.<eos> And I've known you for 15 years.
If you'd have just called me, we could have rolled this up, without those Nazis terrorising kids in a church, for God's sake!<eos> Do you think that was the last thing I wanted?<eos> Spode's Resistance, and I wasn't sure you wouldn't put your country above a friendship.<eos> I wouldn't blame you.<eos> One thing I will tell you that kid, Dunn he doesn't have the experience to handle a case like this.
Any other advice for me?<eos> Just that a friend, a guy who covers the White House, says that Bernard Staines met with Roosevelt three times in the last month.<eos> One of those meetings took place on the Presidential yacht and lasted nearly two hours.<eos> These guys are into something big, Douglas.<eos> I'm telling you, don't go back there and say "no deal."
Why does fucking shit keep happening to me?<eos> oh, that's cute. Abigail.<eos> How's things?<eos> Um, pretty good. Yeah?<eos> Can i talk to you in private for a second?
What did i do?<eos> Nothing, honey.<eos> Why don't we just go to my office?<eos> There was a fine, upstanding black man.<eos> Can i talk to you?
I'm sorry.<eos> Yes, you can call me madeline.<eos> It seems that abigail Is under a bit of stress at home.<eos> Is this about ed threatening your father?<eos> Did he tell you about that?
great. Hi, nathan.<eos> Hello, bonnie.<eos> Hi.<eos> Ed. Nathan.<eos> Um, can i steal you for a second?
Okay. So, are you-- are you all right with this?<eos> I suppose at this point i have to be.<eos> She has a very well-developed sense of self-awareness, so...<eos> If she thinks it's what's best, then...<eos> That's very mature of you.
Areyouokay?<eos> Abigail's decided she wants to go live with her father.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Now i don't have to cook all that vegan crap.<eos> Hey, can i call you back?
I'm happy because the first time In a long time, i'm hopeful.<eos> For us.<eos> Would you dance with me?<eos> I just want to hold you,<eos> Look into your eyes, Be in love with you, And feel you being in love with me.
No, I'm just saying, the anxiety.<eos> Yeah, I know my history.<eos> I'm not trying to get pregnant.<eos> I'm just trying to help out a friend. What's the big problem?<eos> Why is it such a big deal for you?
- And you know what?<eos> - What?<eos> - You're gonna be a lawyer again. - No.<eos> I mean, I have never seen you like that.<eos> For four years I've known you, and... your face looked different, your body changed.
- Just keep your voice down.<eos> Someone is biting our daughter!<eos> Oh, my God, okay.<eos> Honey, Mommy is getting very upset.<eos> I'm getting very, very upset because someone is bullying you.
That's why they call me a bulldog, because I had to learn how to fight back with a bully.<eos> I... we gotta clean this.<eos> Okay, all right. Just...<eos> Hey, you.<eos> Who's ever hurting you, they might be harming somebody else.
How did she friend you?<eos> I'm not her friend, I'm her mother.<eos> And it's my job to be on it and it's yours, too, particularly when she's living with you.<eos> You assume the obligation to parent, which is what I guess you've been pretty...<eos> She's gonna kill you.
He says it's not safe, and I think he might be right, you guys.<eos> It might be better to have him there with us.<eos> Madeline?<eos> Sorry to interrupt.<eos> Can I talk to you, please?
Ooh, I'm starving!<eos> Give me a tender little teenager to...<eos> No, no! Come on, get her!<eos> Stop! - Come here, Mom!<eos> Come, I'll save you.
No, no! Come on, get her!<eos> Stop! - Come here, Mom!<eos> Come, I'll save you.<eos> I'll save you, honey. - No, stop!<eos> No! - I'll save you.
- It's Gabriel.<eos> Holt, listen. I've got a tail for you.<eos> It's not for me anymore.<eos> You know why I wasn't answering your calls, right?<eos> It was to protect you from this.
I guess there's certain jokes you shouldn't make because it happened.<eos> She disappeared.<eos> No clothes gone. No note. Just vanished.<eos> The priest.<eos> He kept you down here.
What are you trying to show me?<eos> You're here.<eos> Here she is, Samara!<eos> This is what becomes of your savior!<eos> With the grace of the Holy Spirit, may the Lord who freed you from sin save you, and raise you up!
You're not good at phonetic Scrabble.<eos> Because it doesn't make any sense.<eos> You're the one who always wants to play.<eos> It was your dad's favorite game.<eos> Did he beat you, too? Yeah.
I, um... Yeah.<eos> I'm not feeling sorry for you. - Uh-huh.<eos> - You're alive now. - You have the Internet. - Mmm-hmm.<eos> Good.<eos> I wish I could meet you in person.
So, um, I guess I'll see you then.<eos> All right. I will see you then, Maddy.<eos> Okay, bye, Olly.<eos> I don't know how Carla and I got our wires crossed.<eos> I don't wanna leave you alone tonight. It's the Fourth of July.
I miss Carla.<eos> Well, Carla almost got you killed.<eos> She's my friend.<eos> No, Madeline. Carla was your nurse.<eos> She was supposed to keep you safe, not endanger your life by inviting strangers into the house.
Pick up!<eos> Hi, Olly.<eos> It's not true. It is.<eos> What kind of future could you have with me?<eos> I'm trying to protect you. Protect me?
There is no other girl.<eos> It's not safe. I don't really think when I'm around you.<eos> Thinking is overrated.<eos> This isn't going anywhere.<eos> I don't wanna lose you.
Remember how I said that my type of SCID was uncommon?<eos> Well, I'm very common now.<eos> I can go wherever I want.<eos> What, you're not sick anymore?<eos> That's what I'm trying to tell you.
No. I...<eos> I'm just saying...<eos> I never would have left my house if it weren't for you.<eos> I love you.<eos> I loved you before I knew you.
Are you okay?<eos> Yes.<eos> - Are you sure? - Yeah.<eos> I'm okay, Olly.<eos> It's nice to be able to talk to you again.
You're sick.<eos> Madeline, please. Please.<eos> I'm not going back inside.<eos> You have to.<eos> You're all I have left. I can't lose you.
I don't believe in anything I can't see.<eos> I feel like there's a fucking axe hanging over my head.<eos> You know, I can't see it, but I believe it.<eos> I can see it fine.<eos> Prison has a way of trying to keep you in prison.
I feel like there's a fucking axe hanging over my head.<eos> You know, I can't see it, but I believe it.<eos> I can see it fine.<eos> Prison has a way of trying to keep you in prison.<eos> They'll do anything they can to keep you inside with them.
I am yours, my beloved Bilquis.<eos> Queens and concubines and maidens hide their faces in shame before you because you are the mother of all beauty.<eos> Trees bow, and warriors fall.<eos> Give me your blessing.<eos> I bow my head before you and worship you.
I hated you guys as a couple because of this, the way that you looked at her.<eos> Robbie did his best to avoid looking at me.<eos> Get used to the boot, puppy.<eos> There is no closure from the dead.<eos> Maybe, you know, three years from now, some therapist will tell you, to write her a letter saying everything you wish you could say to her and drop it in the ocean.
As you say, I work for Mr. Wednesday.<eos> Well, then why the fuck am I wasting my time sitting here talking to you?<eos> You know, I was curious myself how long you would go on sucking your own dick.<eos> Kill him.<eos> We're not just going to kill you, Shadow.
They shake hands, they take shits.<eos> What I'm doing here is of no concern to them.<eos> This is your day, love.<eos> Always has been, always will be.<eos> Just don't try to tell me that they all worship you.
And it will definitely fucking suck.<eos> But that's because he's a lame dad more than anything else.<eos> They are not racist.<eos> All right.<eos> I would've told you.
She used to bite 'em off, suck on 'em, and save 'em in a jewelry box.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> That is so disgusting.<eos> I fucking hate you.
No play-fighting with drunk dudes.<eos> I don't play, I'm just...<eos> Jeremy.<eos> I wasn't gonna hurt him.<eos> He was gonna put you in a fucking headlock.
Logan.<eos> Logan King.<eos> Chris was just telling me how he felt much more comfortable with my being here.<eos> That's nice.<eos> Logan, I hate to tear you away, dear, but the Wincotts were asking about you.
Stop, don't...<eos> Don't do that. Don't...<eos> Okay, okay, I'm sorry.<eos> It's all good, all right?<eos> They got you on display now, huh?
This bitch is crazy.<eos> The bitch is crazy.<eos> Oh, hey, hang on.<eos> Chris.<eos> Chris, I wanna introduce you to some friends.
What?<eos> That there's something between us.<eos> No.<eos> What you talkin' about, girl?<eos> I called you about Chris.
No!<eos> Chris is my best friend.<eos> Look, if you did somethin' to him...<eos> I know you think about fucking me, Rod.<eos> Ain't nobody thought about fucking you.
You could give a shit, right?<eos> Okay.<eos> Let me just tell you what it is.<eos> Phase one was the hypnotism.<eos> That's how they sedate you.
Time and attention, better than lamb's blood.<eos> Huh.<eos> They beat your pretty face all up.<eos> I hate that.<eos> I hate that they were hurting you, Shadow.
If I lose,<eos> I will go with Votan and do what he asks, and I will nod in front of the others.<eos> And if you win?<eos> I get to knock your brains out with my hammer.<eos> But first, you have to go down on your knees, and I will hit you with this.
Who was that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Some rich dude from Beverly Hills. Couldn't find his way home.<eos> Really?<eos> It seemed like he knew you.
Fine.<eos> I'll talk to him.<eos> Thank you, Lexie.<eos> - I'm not screwing him.<eos> - Didn't ask you to.
Sorry if my hands are a little clammy.<eos> I actually am really nervous 'cause this is my first audition actually second if you count the one I just had yesterday.<eos> And if my best friend Cassandra was here she'd pinch me so I'd stop talking like a nervous goober.<eos> Did I just say goober?<eos> Do you want me to pinch you?
- I'm not.<eos> - Really?<eos> 'Cause your lips are moving, and all I'm hearing is blah blah blah.<eos> You've had enough.<eos> I liked you better when you weren't talking.
These goddamn machines.<eos> - Who the hell's that?<eos> - His other son just returned.<eos> Surprisingly taller than I remember.<eos> Good to see you again, Cooper.
Welcome back, Will.<eos> You mind telling me something?<eos> What are you doing back here?<eos> I'm here because I want you to stop it.<eos> I'm asking you just to put an end to all this.
All right?<eos> Toby, rustle up a van.<eos> Will's right.<eos> It's good.<eos> Seeing you back in the labs again, it's good.
I mean, do you ever get out of your head even for one minute?<eos> Let's do an experiment.<eos> Look at me and tell me the first thing that comes to your mind.<eos> I'm driving.<eos> I don't know you very well.
What's the point?<eos> "Why is he doing it?"<eos> "Why is he doing it?"<eos> Let's see.<eos> Well... he'll tell you about the millions of people who died, and he'll tell you about finishing his work to honor them.
I died.<eos> And then you came back here.<eos> How long have I been stuck living in this loop?<eos> How many times have we met on this ferry?<eos> Your death brings you back here.
His vitals are concerning me.<eos> If we pull him now, we might lose him.<eos> Isla.<eos> Isla, please.<eos> I'm not ready to leave you.
- What's happening to me?<eos> - You're about to die.<eos> His heart's stopped, Thomas.<eos> Organs are shutting down.<eos> They're trying to bring you back.
And I said, "How's Mom taking it?"<eos> And he said, "Well, you know Mom.<eos> She rolls with any punch that comes her way,"<eos> and she did, you know.<eos> Uh, she never said "I forgive you."
I'd get in trouble all the time because I wanted to be there.<eos> These two people sat on opposite ends of the sofa on their phones.<eos> And then they called, you know, "We're ready for you on set," and they just went and fucked.<eos> There was no connection, no nothing.<eos> Sex is such an intimate thing, for me, that I have to like you to fuck you.
That's what we do, we leave and we come back.<eos> But when I originally retired, I had no problem doing it because the business that I knew where you actually had sex, like, on beds and desks, and, you know, and it was like, you were having sex.<eos> It was, like, good.<eos> Now, oh my God, I need to do a sitz bath afterwards.<eos> I mean, they freaking kill you.
However, the models use our industry and our sites and the scenes as advertising that they're still an active adult film star.<eos> People think that once you do a porn, it's like over with, but it's really not.<eos> Once you do porn, it actually opens up a door to...<eos> I walk around, and I'm walking in the like street the other day, and I was just crossing the like, road.<eos> I'm crossing the road and a guy yells out by car, "I fucking hate you, Donny Sins.
Uh, it's so much better.<eos> Everything was better before.<eos> You said it, son.<eos> Like so.<eos> Now, if they ask you if it's real butter, what do you say?
When you're done listening to all 13 sides, because there are 13 sides to every story... rewind the tapes, put them back in the box, and pass them on to the next person.<eos> Why the hell am I on this?<eos> Oh, and the box of tapes should have included a map.<eos> I'll be mentioning several spots around our beloved city.<eos> I can't force you to visit them, but if you'd like a little more insight, head for the stars.
Have fun.<eos> Are you gonna tell her?<eos> Tell her what?<eos> Oh, please.<eos> I've known you this entire century.
Math.<eos> All right, then.<eos> Let me know if you need my help.<eos> So, you needed help with a math problem?<eos> I just said that to get you alone on the phone.
Why?<eos> Did you hear something else?<eos> Nope.<eos> We just kissed.<eos> Sorry to disappoint you, but I guess now we're even. Sort of.
For a while, we were the kind of friends you wish you had.<eos> We did disgusting things like shop together.<eos> Sorry!<eos> And compare what we bought.<eos> That top is perfect for you.
Directional.<eos> Oh, my God, your dad is a fighter pilot.<eos> He's a logistics expert, mostly.<eos> Look over there.<eos> He's checking you out.
- Put it away.<eos> What good is having a best friend who works at the movies if you can't get in for free?<eos> - Hey, Hannah.<eos> - Hey, Alex.<eos> Fancy seeing you here.
You okay?<eos> Fuck you, am I okay.<eos> What are you, my bitch now?<eos> Close the frickin' door.<eos> Hey, Jessica's looking for you.
It's hard.<eos> To listen.<eos> Of course it is.<eos> It's tapes from a dead girl.<eos> Doesn't this affect you at all?
No, wait, I forgot.<eos> When I was little, I used to cry every time we drove over a bridge.<eos> I don't know why.<eos> My mom used to try to distract me...<eos> And she would tell you to look for a purple alligator in the water, and you'd be so busy looking you'd forget you were scared.
Also, didn't totally suck at school that Justin Foley liked me back then.<eos> Okay, back then.<eos> Why are you friends now?<eos> Because if I stop hanging out, they're gonna know something's up.<eos> I shouldn't even be talking to you.
So, what do you want, then?<eos> I want you to delete the photos you took.<eos> Destroy the negatives.<eos> Whatever.<eos> - Or I'm turning you in.
I can't imagine why.<eos> So, yeah, we kind of lost track of the plan.<eos> Okay.<eos> Your turn.<eos> I dare you to... take another drink.
Group-texted half the school.<eos> Okay, look, calm down.<eos> No one can tell that's us.<eos> You don't think they'll figure it out?<eos> I shouldn't even be seen talking to you right now.
- Because of a stupid picture?<eos> - Come on, Hannah.<eos> You of all people should know what a picture can do to a person's life.<eos> Me of all people?<eos> I told you...
Whatever we have to do, okay?<eos> You're freaking me out.<eos> Maybe you're too fucking stoned, huh?<eos> You made me paranoid, Tyler.<eos> So now... I'm giving that to you.
You talking about Clay?<eos> Keep your voice down, dude.<eos> Whatever you're doing, I want in.<eos> We're not doing anything, Tyler.<eos> It's not like we would trust you if we were.
I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Like you said...<eos> I know what it feels like to have people judge you.<eos> And it sucks.<eos> And it helps to have a friend who doesn't judge you.
- Me and Hannah?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You're fun girls, right?<eos> That's what it looks like in the picture.<eos> Hate to disappoint you, Monty, but I'll tell you a secret.
No one's going to think anything's happened.<eos> No one's going to think or say anything.<eos> Clay's out of control.<eos> I'll get him under control.<eos> He's not gonna hurt you.
We think you do.<eos> What the hell, man?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Get in the car.<eos> Come on, I'll take you home.
Sure.<eos> You have nothing more to tell me... about bullying at school?<eos> No.<eos> Or, um... Hannah Baker?<eos> Look, I told you, Mom... I didn't really know her.
Hey!<eos> Did you fill out a survey?<eos> Yeah, well, I figured why not.<eos> This is so cool.<eos> I've always wanted to set you up with someone.
So, Montgomery, this case seems pretty straightforward.<eos> - You were the one driving.<eos> - So? So the pedestrian has the right of way.<eos> That is the law.<eos> And you were walking when he almost hit you?
No, no.<eos> My house works.<eos> - Great.<eos> - Cool.<eos> Listen, I'll meet you outside?
Right.<eos> - Hey. Be quiet.<eos> Mom's going through one of her things.<eos> You didn't answer your phone or my texts.<eos> - I know, 'cause my mom. - I needed to see you.
Even the most basic social interactions help keep us alive.<eos> Statistics prove the subjective feeling of loneliness can increase the likelihood of premature death by 26%.<eos> If it sounds like I'm quoting from a school textbook... I am.<eos> Too bad nobody bothered to read it.<eos> And let me tell you... there's all kinds of ways to feel lonely.
Seriously, Pratters?<eos> Jesus!<eos> I'm just saying, all right, if you're getting fat-shamed, then... you know, don't be fat.<eos> Mr. Pratters!<eos> Pratter's, that's like someone saying to you, "Don't be an idiot and a dickwad."
What?<eos> I said let me know if you need to talk.<eos> Any time.<eos> Yeah, thanks.<eos> I'm going to play mind games with you, just like you played with me.
I couldn't believe you were on his list and not mine.<eos> Zach... I don't know if you're doing this on a dare or whatever.<eos> It's not a dare.<eos> It's not.<eos> I just... I know you think every guy likes you because you've got this great ass.
You said something stupid, Zach... and I yelled at you.<eos> Big deal.<eos> You should have let it go.<eos> But you didn't let it go.<eos> You didn't like that someone told you no.
More than that, we need your wheels.<eos> I gotta go to bio, guys.<eos> Why, so you can cry about a frog again, you fuckin' pussy?<eos> I didn't cry.<eos> Fuck you, man.
I gotta go to bio, guys.<eos> Why, so you can cry about a frog again, you fuckin' pussy?<eos> I didn't cry.<eos> Fuck you, man.<eos> Maybe that kind where you think no one truly sees you.
I haven't...<eos> You haven't taken your PSAT yet?<eos> No.<eos> Interesting.<eos> Well, I can tell you that our financial aid tends to go to students at the top of their class, with SATs above the 90th percentile.
Well, good for him.<eos> Iwantedapurpose... a reason for being on this planet.<eos> But that poetry group looked like an AA meeting. Or a support group.<eos> I saw no one within decades of my age.<eos> Until I saw you.
Tell Dad this is broken.<eos> You're a parent.<eos> You're supposed to say things like,<eos> "Be practical, be a pharmacist."<eos> I will never say that to you.
All the answers you seek are at the top of the cliff.<eos> The drag of your hand across my chest<eos> Sparks a blaze my lips cannot extinguish<eos> You, stubborn inferno<eos> You drive fast, and damn the red lights for slowing you down
Can I ask you a legal question? Like, uh...<eos> Like a hypothetical?<eos> You want to ask me a legal question now?<eos> If someone hurt someone... but the victim won't come forward...<eos> Clay, who's hurting you?
What are you doing?<eos> I kind of liked the music. Did you like the music?<eos> Sheri.<eos> What?<eos> I have to tell you...
But that's all the more reason to relax.<eos> - You've been tense as hell.<eos> - I'm fine.<eos> Hey, baby.<eos> Hope you're not letting these two corrupt you.
I'm trying to make it better.<eos> And I'm trying to make up for it.<eos> Will you just meet me after school?<eos> Why?<eos> So that I can show you, before you go tell the world what I did.
And I'm trying to make up for it.<eos> Will you just meet me after school?<eos> Why?<eos> So that I can show you, before you go tell the world what I did.<eos> Give me a chance to prove to you that I'm not like everyone else on the tapes.
Hey, I saw you talking to Clay.<eos> What?<eos> How did you even see that?<eos> Long lenses.<eos> Is he turning you in?
How did you even see that?<eos> Long lenses.<eos> Is he turning you in?<eos> - We shouldn't be talking about this.<eos> - Is he turning you in?
Let's talk to him.<eos> You and me.<eos> The other kids want to bring him down, but we could talk to him.<eos> He might listen to us.<eos> Sheri, is this freak bothering you?
- Do you?<eos> Didn't you just get back from suspension?<eos> Fuck you, Alex.<eos> No thanks, Monty, you're not man enough.<eos> I suppose you expect me to thank you.
If you'll excuse me, ma'am, this rebel is going to tear out into the night on his sweet ride.<eos> - But part of me was saying, "Don't go."<eos> Not even for Clay.<eos> I should have listened to that part of me.<eos> See, I never told you, Clay, but I've always admired you.
Get the hell in there, man!<eos> Now, okay? Now or I'm gonna kick your ass.<eos> You'd never kick my ass.<eos> Don't tempt me.<eos> - How am I tempting you?
Didn't look like nothing.<eos> I've got a family of brawlers, that's what I got here.<eos> Trying to keep you two on the right side of the law.<eos> I'll get that.<eos> Your mom's gonna be glad to see you.
So, uh... what do the cards say?<eos> This one, nine of wands, but it's reversed, which means you feel the world is against you.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Seems right.<eos> Like accusing people of ratting you out.
Babe, you had no idea that girl was suffering.<eos> You can't blame yourself for what she did.<eos> What if I could?<eos> I know you can't.<eos> Now I'll let you out.
Okay, just leave me alone, Clay.<eos> You should just go.<eos> Part of me was saying...<eos> "Please don't leave."<eos> Part of me never wanted to see you again.
Part of me was saying...<eos> "Please don't leave."<eos> Part of me never wanted to see you again.<eos> - You all right?<eos> - I don't want you here.
How did I know that?<eos> I-I just left Hannah.<eos> I left her there.<eos> She needed me, and I walked away.<eos> You were doing what she told you to do.
- Leave me alone!<eos> Okay, just leave me alone, Clay.<eos> You should just go.<eos> I thought it was okay.<eos> I don't want you here.
- No! The fuck, man?<eos> I'm sick of this shit.<eos> Jesus!<eos> What the hell, Justin?<eos> I'm sorry. I needed to see you.
I'm sorry. I needed to see you.<eos> I'm gonna scream.<eos> - I texted and I called.<eos> - I'm gonna call the police.<eos> Jess, please, I was trying to protect you.
It's not a big deal.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - I could have mailed it.<eos> I was going to the bank anyway.<eos> And I wanted to come see you.
I didn't mean tell the truth about everything.<eos> Why not, Tyler?<eos> You got more secrets you're trying to hide?<eos> You can do whatever you want.<eos> No one's going to believe you.
So she wanted it.<eos> She got in the hot tub with you. And that means she wanted it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> She did.<eos> But she didn't tell you so.
Justin... is Justin Foley.<eos> Are you and Justin still friendly?<eos> Justin Foley is dead to me.<eos> Jesus Christ, are you following me?<eos> I have to talk to you.
Shit's so fucked up.<eos> You think?<eos> - Just talk to me.<eos> - Why, Justin?<eos> Why should I talk to you?
She dropped it on the counter and walked away.<eos> She dropped a package off with a friend, then took another to the post office.<eos> Hannah.<eos> Oh. Hey. Robert.<eos> Hi. So good to see you.
Oh, shit.<eos> Jesus, is that you?<eos> Who are all these people, Paul?<eos> Hi, Richard.<eos> Nice to see you.
All right?<eos> Let's go.<eos> I couldn't lose anyone.<eos> I couldn't lose any of them.<eos> I couldn't lose you.
It's not true.<eos> Dwight?<eos> He's lying about it. I would never do that.<eos> Why? Why? Why would he do that?<eos> Why would he intentionally try to hurt you?
That's what happens next.<eos> And we're gonna lose people, maybe a lot of them, maybe even each other.<eos> Even then, it'll be worth it.<eos> When I thought that...<eos> I can't lose you.
It wasn't a life.<eos> What we did back there, what we're doing now, making a future for Judith and for Glenn and Maggie's baby, fighting the fight, that's living. You showed me that.<eos> You can lose me.<eos> - No. - Yes, you can.<eos> I can lose you.
We'll find more, figure it out.<eos> Soon.<eos> In a few more days.<eos> Hey. You all right?<eos> Yeah, yeah, I was just... I was just coming over to see you.
Have you seen Rosita?<eos> She didn't show for her guard shift this morning.<eos> She probably just went out looking for more.<eos> Why were you... Why were you coming by?<eos> I have something to tell you.
Hey, we can leave for Alexandria right now.<eos> Right now, if you want to.<eos> Is there anything I can help you with? - No.<eos> - Well, can I just...<eos> If you don't mind, could I walk back to the cottage with you? No!
It's better to talk about it when we get back, Your Majesty.<eos> We'll talk about it now.<eos> How's the kid?<eos> He's dead.<eos> Start walking back now before I kill you.
We'll talk about it now.<eos> How's the kid?<eos> He's dead.<eos> Start walking back now before I kill you.<eos> You say one word or throw one look, I'll kill you right here and now.
I'm sorry.<eos> Girl, pick that shit up right now and scram.<eos> And I'll take that.<eos> Now.<eos> Don't make me cut it off you, girl.
That's why I'm on guard duty now.<eos> No offense to that last guy, but he could hardly handle a gun.<eos> Get up.<eos> You're getting out.<eos> We're breaking you out.
I get it now.<eos> I got to hand it to you.<eos> You've got some beach-ball-sized lady nuts on you, coming in all kamikaze like that.<eos> Big question here, and I need the truth on this one...<eos> Did Rick put you up to this?
Gonna go clean it.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hi.<eos> Stay quiet and put your hands on your head.<eos> We should've just killed you in the village.
I would like to believe that it's painless.<eos> I am not -- I'm not certain.<eos> I made it at the behest of others for similar reasons, only it came to pass that they were feeding me the bum's steer, so I cut bait.<eos> The difference here is that you and I have been long-time traveling companions, and you have proven yourself to be honest, brave, and fully self-aware.<eos> I'm certain I owe you for things.
Do we need to... No, no, no.<eos> We're okay for now.<eos> Well, good afternoon to you.<eos> You're here.<eos> And I'm feelin' all kinds of glad to see you right now.
You're here.<eos> And I'm feelin' all kinds of glad to see you right now.<eos> Are they back?<eos> Not yet.<eos> I know you were pullin' late shift, and you wanna tonight, so I didn't want to wake you up.
Accompany my regiment.<eos> The Saviors are a dragon with many heads, their numbers legion.<eos> We must seek allies in this endeavor.<eos> That's Benjamin's armor.<eos> Do you wear it to serve you, or do you wear it in his honor?
The decision was made a long time ago, before any of us knew each other, when we were all strangers who would have just passed each other on the street before the world ended.<eos> And now we mean everything to each other.<eos> You were in trouble.<eos> You were trapped.<eos> Glenn didn't know you, but he helped you.
I have a daughter.<eos> I can do better.<eos> I can.<eos> But I cannot lose this job.<eos> So, I'm asking you.
And if you bring in more guys, you can charge whatever you want.<eos> - Just got to get them hooked?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Now, rember, you run the show.<eos> If some guy asks you to do something and you don't feel comfortable, you cut them off.
Oh, where you going, big guy?<eos> Where you going?<eos> Think I'm gonna break your hip.<eos> You're gonna break my hip?<eos> I'll put you through the window, you cunt.
- That's one -- one heck of a story.<eos> I sure do wish I could have been there to see it happen.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> Who wants to watch a mad scientist use handmade sci-fi tools to take out highly trained alien guards when we can sit here and be a family at Shoney's?<eos> Dad, it's great to have you back, no matter where we are, but wouldn't you like to go home?
He loves me.<eos> You're a rogue Rick -- irrational, passionate.<eos> You love your grandkids.<eos> You came to rescue them.<eos> I came to kill you, bro.
Pickle Man, you should know this isn't personal!<eos> You should know that isn't original.<eos> They have my daughter.<eos> There's nothing I won't do to see her again.<eos> Yeah, there's lots I wouldn't do to see my daughter, but killing you gets me to her quicker than your derivative bullshit.
Hey, I don't know.<eos> I mean, look, when I get drunk,<eos> I get stupid and emotional and there's no logic to it.<eos> I felt like I was losing Morty to the Vindicators, and maybe this is my way of saying, "Okay", you can have him but only if you know how important he is,<eos> "otherwise I'll kill you."
Oh, shit.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I'm... not good at goodbyes, and...<eos> I'm drunk, so, you know, I just...<eos> It looks like I'm never going to see you again.
I got you five minutes.<eos> Go get him tiger.<eos> Yeah.<eos> How we doing?<eos> Good to see you, thanks for coming.
You tricked me.<eos> You got...<eos> I'm giving ya 'til tomorrow to get my money.<eos> Five thousand.<eos> Otherwise, well maybe I turn you into the cops.
You have no intention of leaving, do you?<eos> What exactly do you suggest I tell him?<eos> Whatever the fuck you wanna tell him.<eos> Anne.<eos> At a certain point, there is a good chance he'll just decide to kill you than take your no for an answer.
I am tired of this. This thing that perpetuates itself with anger and bluster and blood.<eos> I do not want to be your friend.<eos> What I want is for all of this to end.<eos> For it to end, you must end.<eos> I imagine I have some obligation to surrender you to Captain Berringer, but the spectacle he would make of your trial and execution would only fan the flames of what is burning in Nassau now.
- Go, honey, go, go, go.<eos> - Bring it on, sister. - Yes!<eos> - My gosh.<eos> What?<eos> I should've never Googled him or stirred you up like that.
No, I'm not gonna do that.<eos> I just don't think she's a dangerous person.<eos> Really?<eos> I'm starting to get a little bit worried.<eos> I'm gonna have to call you back.
Really?<eos> I'm starting to get a little bit worried.<eos> I'm gonna have to call you back.<eos> Is Perry there?<eos> - I'm just gonna have to call you back, - all right?
- Hello. - Hey.<eos> Juliette, right?<eos> - What do you want? - Do you want...<eos> I just wanted to say that I'm so sorry.<eos> I completely lost control and I stepped out of line, and I should have never shoved you like that.
- What?<eos> - Get ready.<eos> - We can be a little late.<eos> No, we can't.<eos> Well, I'm just very excited to see you.
I'm going to have to ask you to leave. Tom, Tom.<eos> We're just talking.<eos> Everything is fine.<eos> No, no, everything's not fine. I can't have you in here harassing my customers.<eos> Now, I'm asking you politely, please.
- And I agree!<eos> It's enough.<eos> And we can make it stop together, but... but for you to all of a sudden...<eos> It's not all of a sudden!<eos> I should've left you a long time ago!
But I was just protecting my friend.<eos> - She's just a little bit drunk.<eos> - And I'm sorry I was so horrible.<eos> Celeste.<eos> Can I talk to you for a minute?
- And I'm sorry I was so horrible.<eos> Celeste.<eos> Can I talk to you for a minute?<eos> - Please.<eos> Celeste, can I talk to you?
It was him and one other.<eos> I had six men.<eos> I thought it would be sufficient to apprehend him myself.<eos> Apprehend him?<eos> No one asked you to apprehend him.
But instead, I am stuck here for as long as it takes to fix this.<eos> In order to do that, you are going to have to give me something to fix it with.<eos> But you'd better come up with something of value I can use to get him to walk away from this.<eos> You think you can control him.<eos> And by the time you realize he has been controlling you, it is going to be too late.
- Come here.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> When do you get your cast off?<eos> Um, day after tomorrow.<eos> I was watching you from the porch with Noah.
Trust me.<eos> Do you accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and savior?<eos> What?<eos> Do you accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and savior?<eos> Then I baptize you, Kevin Garvey, in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, buried in the likeness of his death and raised in the likeness of his resurrection.
Do you accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and savior?<eos> Then I baptize you, Kevin Garvey, in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, buried in the likeness of his death and raised in the likeness of his resurrection.<eos> He is saved.<eos> That didn't count.<eos> Want me to put the air on, dry you out?
Of course you can.<eos> What?<eos> Here.<eos> You can't die here in Miracle.<eos> And that twisted bullshit, Matt, is why your wife is taking your son and leaving you.
"If you come to me, but will not leave your family, you cannot be my follower."<eos> Is that from your book?<eos> No, Kevin. That's Jesus.<eos> - Well, I'm not fucking Jesus.<eos> - I'm not saying you are, but, the beard looks good on you.
- No.<eos> No, man!<eos> Evie did it before.<eos> Maybe she did it again.<eos> I am trusting you with this, and I know you'll do the right thing.
- Oh, she looks lovely.<eos> - They always look lovely.<eos> This is great, I can't even play the game I invented.<eos> Okay, Frankie?<eos> Someone has one thing, just one thing, to say to you.
Someone has one thing, just one thing, to say to you.<eos> Frankie, the work in this collection blows me away.<eos> Put a sock in it, Sol.<eos> I told you, man.<eos> He told you.
Plums. I don't even like them that much.<eos> Why are you all drinking in a clump?<eos> We are... just celebrating the fact that I'm going to buy one of your paintings.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> Which one spoke to you?
Master!<eos> What is going on?<eos> Have fun!<eos> Monk!<eos> Pay your way or the boss will throw you out. Stop sleeping!
Master, you surely know my brothers and I, we are all of one heart.<eos> If you punish Brother Monkey, then my heart aches too.<eos> And my heart is really aching!<eos> That's so true.<eos> When I hit you, my heart really aches.
And my heart is really aching!<eos> That's so true.<eos> When I hit you, my heart really aches.<eos> Master, try it if you don't believe us.<eos> When I punish you I suffer heartache too.
Now you're poisoned, I have to pull you.<eos> Will you please stop dousing me?<eos> I caught a cold, my nose is runny.<eos> Caught a cold? Bullshit!<eos> Better take a cleaver to you and sell you in the market. Less trouble for me that way.
I did manipulate you.<eos> So that you'd know how indignity feels.<eos> I see.<eos> Now that you've said all that...<eos> - ... I'll finish you off with one slap!
Sorry.<eos> My heart has no space for anyone else.<eos> I'm so silly, aren't I?<eos> I knew that but I still asked.<eos> Felicity I'm going to send you on your way.
Felicity I'm going to send you on your way.<eos> Don't take it so hard.<eos> Master, we should talk.<eos> Did you ever have feelings for Felicity?<eos> I'm asking you, did you ever have feelings for Felicity?
Of course not!<eos> You're the only one in my heart.<eos> Only me?<eos> Brother Monkey, your headband was once Miss Duan's.<eos> The memory of her still haunts Master so he sometimes takes you for her.
This can't go on, I'd better get back the headband. Or she'll ask again.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> - Give back the headband. - Are you crazy?<eos> You gave it to me.<eos> It doesn't suit you, it makes you look awful.
Thought we said 9:00.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But new chief showed up early.<eos> Wants to gather the department together first thing.<eos> So, since the department is you and me, I figured I'd come and get you.
- Ron?<eos> Can you hear me? - Is this you, Gloria?<eos> I wanted to check on Nathan, make sure he was getting... Ah, I can't quite hear you.<eos> - Ron, it's Gloria. - Hello?<eos> - Hold on, I'll call you... - What's that?
You were supposed to...<eos> While I broke in, you would pretend to...<eos> And you didn't see it, Ray.<eos> He moved the stamp, your brother.<eos> He didn't trust you.
Oh, yeah, it's gonna happen all right.<eos> You see that?<eos> That's the last dime you're ever gonna see from the Parking Lot King of Minnesota.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Well, I got something to show you, too.
You know, you're the cheddar.<eos> The cheese.<eos> Howard Zimmerman.<eos> Producer.<eos> So, let me ask you, you ever think about turning that...
Yeah.<eos> Come back.<eos> I want you to meet somebody.<eos> I'm...<eos> This is the genius I was telling you about.
It's dynamite, isn't it?<eos> They call it a "space opera," if you can believe that.<eos> Yeah.<eos> No, the kid is banging out the screenplay now as we speak.<eos> So, listen, is Yablans gonna let you out?
Consequences, Mr. Stussy.<eos> That's the way the cookie crumbles.<eos> Maybe a few months at Stillwater will straighten her out.<eos> These rules aren't just for you, Ray.<eos> What if she's manipulating you, using her poontang to hoodwink and bamboozle?
I've even seeded in the odd 100K as an act of good faith.<eos> Emmit, you wanna... Your problem, Mr. Feltz, is you think you started a parking lot company.<eos> You started a bank.<eos> This is a true story.<eos> When I'm done with you, they'll be sponging you off the floor.
Is that what he's telling you? Varga?<eos> - 'Cause that's just crazy.<eos> - Is it?<eos> You really think I'm...<eos> In the face of all logic, that somehow I decided, me, the partner in a multi-million dollar corporation, that I decided to what, turn on you?
On the sofa, I thought, unless you're attached to a more classic bed narrative.<eos> Non-descript, though, you know, the furnishings, so they can't tie it to us.<eos> That's...<eos> I think you solved it.<eos> We can keep you in a shirt, hiding your difference.
Contracts have been signed by the majordomo himself.<eos> So, you see, lives are changing for the better.<eos> And all you have to do is review the accounts, write up the deals, and approve the paperwork.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Yuri will show you to your new office.
Big whoop, I'm out of a job.<eos> She left me.<eos> Oh, well, you know, reap what you sow.<eos> You should've done what's right when you had the chance.<eos> Buddy, when I'm done with you, they'll be sponging you off the floor. Yeah?
Enjoy your time.<eos> How about another game?<eos> Same terms.<eos> How can be same?<eos> You want me to kill you twice?
You no like it, you sleep on floor. Is good enough for me.<eos> You only learned to live with less.<eos> There is food, there is roof.<eos> What more do you need?<eos> A court to adore you.
There is food, there is roof.<eos> What more do you need?<eos> A court to adore you.<eos> In the old country, you were draped with pearl, loved, feared, waited upon.<eos> Excess suits you.
Still so beautiful.<eos> I thought I told the pretty lies.<eos> You want fortune or you want truth.<eos> I want knowledge over comfort, over all things, always.<eos> They will kill you this time.
- No, it hasn't.<eos> We're gonna rob a bank.<eos> You want some coffee?<eos> You best be getting on, son.<eos> Jack's Crocodile will take a bite outta you.
I can't hear you!<eos> Mmc!<eos> Who are we?<eos> Mmc!<eos> Good to see you, cotyar.
Command, be advised, we are standing down.<eos> The martians were targeting phoebe research station, Which sustained multiple direct hits.<eos> The ice moon fractured under the barrage. And the fragments spiraled into saturn.<eos> It's completely gone.<eos> Wish I had your hat for you, amigo.
Everyone knows you support a deal with Iran.<eos> Just as everyone knows you're already convinced they're cheating on it.<eos> Where's my lawyer?<eos> Where's Mr. Hashem?<eos> I need to talk to you about something.
He was IRGC-trained.<eos> Breaking would have taken days.<eos> We had hours.<eos> Who did the interview?<eos> I just told you, I did.
He's not.<eos> First of all, we-- we don't have access to actual conversations, just a record of their calls.<eos> - Oh, please.<eos> - Even if we did, this is the kind of thing that kills careers.<eos> I shouldn't even be talking to you.
- Please?<eos> - Which one is his?<eos> I can get you what you need, and we can have a good time.<eos> Tommy...<eos> He will fuck you up.
Phone.<eos> You know, I don't know your name.<eos> - Thoms.<eos> - Thoms, I'm Carrie.<eos> It's nice to see you again, Carrie.
Don't waste it.<eos> Jesus Christ, get up!<eos> - Go away.<eos> - Come on, on your feet.<eos> I'm taking you back to the VA.
- It's a very alarming charge.<eos> - The Russians hacked our committees.<eos> The continuation of endless war.<eos> Can't you get that through your fucking skull?<eos> The revolution will put you in the driver's seat.
You know why I left, Saul?<eos> It's the bullshit.<eos> You coming all the way out here to say what you said just now.<eos> Why don't you leave?<eos> Always good to see you.
! That's just their opening.<eos> We will bargain them down.<eos> Fuck that!<eos> Sekou, listen.<eos> It's your call in the end, but it's also my job to counsel you properly.
Just not at the moment to us.<eos> How do you get a drink in this place?<eos> Hey, baby!<eos> What...<eos> I thought I'd never find you again.
They poisoned you...<eos> a cell did... and left you for dead.<eos> Just play it.<eos> You've really never seen this?<eos> I must've watched it a hundred times when I was trying to find you.
Yuck.<eos> I know.<eos> What's good, man? - What's up, brother?<eos> I'm good, man.<eos> Good to see you. All right.
What's good, man? - What's up, brother?<eos> I'm good, man.<eos> Good to see you. All right.<eos> What's up, man?<eos> - Good to see you home so soon.
Why do you always take their side?<eos> I don't.<eos> I don't wanna argue.<eos> I'm just sad that the only time you come to see me in 12 years, it was a cover for your work.<eos> I did want to see you.
You'll be late for your flight.<eos> Allow us to drive you.<eos> - Not necessary. I called a cab.<eos> - Please, I insist.<eos> Dorit. Nice to see you again.
Allow us to drive you.<eos> - Not necessary. I called a cab.<eos> - Please, I insist.<eos> Dorit. Nice to see you again.<eos> And what a treat, Saul coming to visit you at long last.
What now?<eos> Tovah will be here in the morning.<eos> In the morning.<eos> It's like that, is it?<eos> You fuck with us, we fuck with you.
You fuck with us, we fuck with you.<eos> Why you so angry, Etai?<eos> I don't like being lied to, especially by my friends.<eos> You're in the wrong business.<eos> Listen, if I knew for a fact Iran was close to a nuclear weapon, I'd tell you.
-It's a very alarming charge.<eos> -The Russians hacked our committees.<eos> The continuation of endless war.<eos> Can't you get that through your fucking skull?<eos> The revolution will put you in the driver's seat.
W-What do you mean?<eos> When my back was turned.<eos> No.<eos> I was trying to save your life.<eos> They were gonna kill you.
Why did you show them the...pictures?<eos> I didn't.<eos> You said the...<eos> FBI couldn't find him.<eos> No, I showed one guy, the guy who is helping us, who got me in here to see you.
- It's a very alarming charge.<eos> - The Russians hacked our committees.<eos> The continuation of endless war.<eos> Can't you get that through your fucking skull?<eos> The revolution will put you in the driver's seat.
- Well, right.<eos> But...<eos> The problem is, they know it must have come from the NSA.<eos> Your organization's gonna be looking internally, so it's not gonna be enough just to say that.<eos> I didn't give it to you. Really.
I--<eos> What I need to believe is that you're protecting Franny, okay?<eos> Because that's what I asked you to do when I left here this morning.<eos> That's what I've told everybody here.<eos> I shouldn't have left you alone here with her.
- It's a very alarming charge.<eos> - The Russians hacked our committees.<eos> The continuation of endless war.<eos> Can't you get that through your fucking skull?<eos> The revolution will put you in the driver's seat.
That I... flatlined and was dead for three minutes.<eos> Not exactly.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> You were in a coma, Peter, a deep coma.<eos> Carrie ordered the doctors to wake you up.
It's a very alarming charge.<eos> The Russians hacked our committees.<eos> The continuation of endless war.<eos> Can't you get that through your fucking skull?<eos> The revolution will put you in the driver's seat.
Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> I mean, if there is ever anything I can--<eos> I said I'm fine.<eos> It was really great seeing you again.
'Cause, tomorrow, we hit her even harder.<eos> Here you go, talking points for tomorrow.<eos> - What's this?<eos> - A work in progress-- not ready yet.<eos> Plenty of other stuff to show you, though, if you're interested.
Just press "play."<eos> Carrie, it's Quinn.<eos> This is Clarice.<eos> You can trust her.<eos> She will bring you to me.
Look.<eos> What am I looking at?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> That's him, Carrie.<eos> The m-m-man who was-- watched you, put the bomb in the van.
Sounds a lot more like guilt if you ask me.<eos> Gentlemen, I have your passports.<eos> Welcome to New York. Thank you.<eos> I want political asylum.<eos> I can put you in front of someone who can make it happen.
Quinn, what are you doing?<eos> Look.<eos> My God.<eos> That's him, Carrie.<eos> The m-man who was... watched you, put the bomb in the van.
It's a very alarming charge.<eos> The Russians hacked our committees.<eos> The continuation of endless war.<eos> Can't you get that through your fucking skull?<eos> The revolution will put you in the driver's seat.
I don't care.<eos> Yeah, well, I do.<eos> What is that supposed to mean?<eos> What, I don't care?<eos> I don't care so much I visited you in the hospital every day?
You can get in.<eos> It's true what you said last night... about Berlin.<eos> I told myself... I was doing what you would want me to do, preventing an attack.<eos> - Look, I-I...<eos> - And I should have told you.
You're worried she's gonna say no.<eos> You are such a guy, Charlie... in a good way.<eos> She's gonna say yes.<eos> Yeah, what makes you say that?<eos> Because I've seen the way that she looks at you and...
All right, so what's the plan?<eos> We find the bleed, sew it up, save Charlie's arm.<eos> - And Plan "B"?<eos> - There is no Plan "B."<eos> Plan "C" is you get too frisky in there, I turf you.
And just days ago, Alfred has sent his very own priest.<eos> You killed all the Danes that ruled Eoferwic?<eos> We have.<eos> All those that did not flee.<eos> The holy city of Eoferwic welcomes you.
But that's the risk we have to take.<eos> Have you been stealing from Alfred, Father Beocca?<eos> Uhtred!<eos> Oh, my goodness, Uhtred!<eos> What a joy it is to see you!
To help you kill men who stare?<eos> No, Lord.<eos> To protect myself and those I care for.<eos> Yourself included.<eos> I give to you my heart, my soul and I ask in return...
Go!<eos> Or with one touch of my horsemen, you will be cursed!<eos> Go!<eos> You are going nowhere, but to the devil himself.<eos> I should kill you now.
- Then you owe me.<eos> - I do.<eos> I do.<eos> Serve me.<eos> - Serve you?
You are never welcome here.<eos> My father asks for you to keep the hounds quiet.<eos> Thyra... if you do not comply, he will have them killed again.<eos> And again, you shall bring me pups.<eos> He will have men hump you.
My father asks for you to keep the hounds quiet.<eos> Thyra... if you do not comply, he will have them killed again.<eos> And again, you shall bring me pups.<eos> He will have men hump you.<eos> I tell you every time... you do not need to live like this.
Vivat Rex Guthred!<eos> Vivat Rex Guthred!<eos> Guthred...<eos> Or do I now call you Lord?<eos> You can call me whatever pleases you.
It is?<eos> You don't need to explain, Kevin.<eos> Hey, look.<eos> I got a tattoo.<eos> A couple hundred more and I'll catch up with you.
- What?<eos> - I'm not in it, asshole.<eos> - I'm sorry?<eos> - I'm not in it.<eos> I spent hours talking you through what I'm doing down here.
Well, the book is about what's happening to your son.<eos> You know, if he were in Australia...<eos> I don't want him in Australia.<eos> I don't want him anywhere fucking near Australia!<eos> Since you clearly weren't listening the first time I told you,
Nora?<eos> Nora, your-- your sister.<eos> Y-yeah, she's not picking up the phone either.<eos> But why would you know that? Because you're too busy chartering cargo planes to Australia.<eos> Tell me, Matt, does that seem reasonable to you?
Nora, your-- your sister.<eos> Y-yeah, she's not picking up the phone either.<eos> But why would you know that? Because you're too busy chartering cargo planes to Australia.<eos> Tell me, Matt, does that seem reasonable to you?<eos> Well, it must seem reasonable to you since you're trying to get on it.
- He called me.<eos> - And what exactly did he say?<eos> What did he specifically say that leads you to believe he's delusional?<eos> Did he see something or someone?<eos> Did-- did she tell you?
- Can you believe this guy?<eos> - It was just a joke.<eos> It's blasphemy, is what it is.<eos> You know he's not God.<eos> Why does it bother you?
I didn't want to hurt you.<eos> I understand.<eos> I wouldn't have told me either.<eos> I understand, too.<eos> She was protecting you.
Is that why you're killing me?<eos> When I was a boy, I was sick.<eos> And I prayed to you to save me, and you did.<eos> Why is it back?<eos> I can save you again.
- Is it them?<eos> - You tell me.<eos> Dr. Bekker and Dr. Eden.<eos> Yeah, that's them.<eos> Told you it was the right house.
Remember when we went to coffee for the first time, just you and me?<eos> Of course I do.<eos> I was hurting.<eos> You reached across the table, took my hands, and looked at me, and I felt like I could've told you anything.<eos> But what I couldn't tell you... I thought my daughter might still be alive.
You reached across the table, took my hands, and looked at me, and I felt like I could've told you anything.<eos> But what I couldn't tell you... I thought my daughter might still be alive.<eos> Erika never doubted it. She took it in and moved on. But me, I just...<eos> I just couldn't believe it.<eos> I should've told you.
Where's everybody?<eos> Inside, sleeping.<eos> I drugged their food.<eos> Jesus, Laurie.<eos> Well, I wanted to talk to you. Just the two of us.
Fuck, yes. - Yeah, yeah, okay.<eos> - I knew you'd remember.<eos> You know how many times I had to listen to that theme song?<eos> I'm really sorry I put you through that.<eos> It was just a phase. I forgive you.
And every time you sent me a letter with a new Matt Lib in it, that's who it was addressed to...<eos> "The Bravest Girl on Earth." I forgot about that.<eos> You drive me fucking nuts.<eos> But you've always been a great gecko, Matt.<eos> If I was a great gecko, I'd be trying to talk you out of this.
I had to try.<eos> Please just go.<eos> I'll be there if you change your mind.<eos> They shut down all of Main Street, so you're not gonna be able to miss it.<eos> It's good to see you, Nora.
But every year, I would come back.<eos> Because... Because I couldn't stop.<eos> And a couple days ago...<eos> I showed your picture to that nun... and I saw it in her eyes. She recognized you.<eos> She knew you.
- Every once in a while.<eos> Just when I need to.<eos> - She knows you're here?<eos> - Don't be mad at her.<eos> She's my therapist. She wasn't allowed to tell you.
Did I wanna be with you, Kevin?<eos> Of course I did.<eos> But so much time had passed.<eos> It was too late.<eos> And I knew that if I told you what happened... that you would never believe me.
Why are you telling me this?<eos> Because I know you, Titus Andromedon.<eos> I know how weak you are in the face of adversity, how easily you give up.<eos> Only when it comes to stuff.<eos> So I'm going to tell you where to find Lonny Dufrene every morning before work.
Get really low.<eos> Hey, it's me, man, Lonny Dufrene.<eos> I had, like, a far out idea for the new Gordon--<eos> Titus Andromedon.<eos> I bet he's never heard of you either, lady!
- Drew saw our messages.<eos> He thinks you are planning an attack at the school with someone, he doesn't know it's with me.<eos> What are we doing here?<eos> I'm getting you safe.<eos> Isaac's not on anyone's books, he's got guns, he's got men, he can protect you.
And you think I gave them up?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.<eos> But I have to be sure.<eos> I want to clear you, but I need your help.
Listen... everything that's happening, it's on me.<eos> Eric, that's not true.<eos> I should have benched Grimes on the Bin-Khalid raid.<eos> Rebecca, he was messed up before the mission, okay?<eos> He started talking crazy about this conspiracy and that conspiracy... I just... I should have reported it, brought it to you, but I covered for him, I just...
To try to change his mind?<eos> Nah, he gonna do what he gonna do.<eos> Right? You know the man you married.<eos> Look.<eos> I'm out of here as soon as I get a location on the Dominican deal, but, uh, I'll leave a man behind to watch you, and Aisha can get you whatever you need.
What you looking for?<eos> Won't know till I see it.<eos> I know what you want... because you and me, we want the same thing.<eos> Isaac. Why are you worrying about Isaac?<eos> He treats you like a little bitch.
Everything like I told you.<eos> Get out, and open my door, now.<eos> Out.<eos> Andy, he's inside.<eos> We ain't letting you out of here till you give us something.
So, she wasn't there to pray.<eos> She-she went there to talk down some crackpot imam, call him out.<eos> Well, even if that's true, do you trust the voters to make that distinction?<eos> I do.<eos> Well, John, you're an optimist, and that's your great gift, but I'm telling you that a lot of these folks...
I think they'd appreciate my loyalty.<eos> Oh, let me take this, it's Rebecca.<eos> Ask her what she thinks.<eos> I will.<eos> Everyone's been asking after you, darling.
I'm fine, baby.<eos> Listen, this whole thing with Ben is winding down, and we cleared the guy running CTU.<eos> Does that mean we can go home?<eos> Soon.<eos> I'm-a come get you, and... we can start to put this whole thing behind us.
Okay, listen, if... if you can get her number and tell me when she made that call, CTU might be able to pull up a transcript or some kind of recording, okay?<eos> They can do that?<eos> They can do a lot of stuff I didn't know they could.<eos> Just make sure you tap into all those surveillance cameras, okay?<eos> It's good to see you again, Carter.
Why don't you grab a bite to eat first.<eos> I'll catch up with you outside.<eos> Hmm? Thank you so much, both of you.<eos> Okay, so tell me, what the hell is going on?<eos> John... this is the last thing I want to be telling you.
Do him right away.<eos> Look, I ain't gonna make a move until I see he's got the merchandise.<eos> The second I do, he's a dead man.<eos> He's coming now.<eos> I'll call you when it's done.
I'll go upstairs.<eos> Drop it!<eos> I said drop it, now!<eos> Throw it down.<eos> I'll kill you.
Get set.<eos> Give me a sec.<eos> - What?<eos> - Isaac.<eos> Royo's not there to make a deal, he's there to kill you.
All right?<eos> You asked me to watch her, that's what I'm doing.<eos> I'll get her to call you.<eos> Yeah, you do that.<eos> Rebecca. Good to see you, Eric.
I am? Yeah.<eos> In fact, when I first got here,<eos> Mullins asked me to document every time you screwed up, so he could have a reason to let you go.<eos> You're spying on me?<eos> You know, if I was, I wouldn't have told you.
Okay, you need to get your hands on a syringe.<eos> As large as possible.<eos> Then, when the doctor leaves...<eos> Amira?<eos> I'll call you back.
I did, but what was I supposed to do?<eos> Shoot them in the back?<eos> No, no. Look, I'm just...<eos> Man.<eos> I'm supposed to be protecting you.
Man.<eos> I'm supposed to be protecting you.<eos> You saved my life.<eos> Yeah. I'm just glad you're safe.<eos> Look, let's get you back, all right?
What? Did you get it?<eos> I said yes.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm on my way.<eos> Text me when you're done, and I'll pick you up outside.
I know I have to kill him, Khasan.<eos> I just need you to tell me how to do it.<eos> You need to get your hands on a syringe.<eos> Isaac,<eos> Royo's not there to make a deal... he's there to kill you.
How do I go back to my job now?<eos> How do I just go back to my life, knowing what you and John really think of me?<eos> You should know that John never thought you were guilty.<eos> In fact, he was the one who uncovered the additional evidence.<eos> I'll have someone start to process you out as soon as possible.
And when it's over, everyone will know our names.<eos> Princess.<eos> Papa.<eos> Oh. Don't cry, little one.<eos> I'm happy to see you, too.
I thought it was almost over.<eos> Yeah, I...<eos> I thought so, too.<eos> Eric, what is going on?<eos> Listen, I want you to go to Christine's, and I'm gonna come get you as soon as I can, okay?
We don't have that choice.<eos> We're here.<eos> Trying to do what we got to do, but...<eos> Look.<eos> I'm asking you to talk to him.
And what about the example you're setting right now?<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> Isaac, these men...<eos> - They respect you.<eos> - Yeah. They revere you.
Nothing, man.<eos> We cool. We all good.<eos> Come here.<eos> Ben Grimes.<eos> Didn't expect to see you again.
What does it matter anyway?<eos> Of course it matters.<eos> - Here, take some more.<eos> - How can you do this to your own father?<eos> We don't want to hurt you.
You'll be fine here.<eos> It's okay, Amira.<eos> Get behind me.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Saving you.
Khasan...<eos> Khasan, you're all right.<eos> Come here, come here.<eos> You're all right.<eos> I'll bandage you and clean you up.
I took care of it.<eos> And now I take his place.<eos> No, he's not...<eos> He and I will be together again, soon.<eos> Someone will find you.
Isaac. We have her.<eos> And we took the brother as well.<eos> You told John you gave the identities of the Army Rangers to Jadalla Bin-Khalid.<eos> I know he's told you some story about my working with terrorists, but... I swear to you, I don't have the least clue what he's talking about.<eos> I'm asking you one last time, help them find these terrorists.
And he has my brother.<eos> Oh, my God. And if I bring him somebody to repair the list, then he'll let them go.<eos> Uh, wait a minute.<eos> You're... you're not actually asking me to repair the drive, are you?<eos> I'm asking you to help me destroy it.
Henry's been released.<eos> An agent will stall your husband in the debrief for as long as he can.<eos> - I should go.<eos> - You still haven't told me who you're using for this job.<eos> I'm trying to insulate you in case this goes sideways.
But I will.<eos> Tie him up, Andy.<eos> Sorry, Tom.<eos> Andy finish writing the virus.<eos> Rebecca? It's good to see you.
- Eric?<eos> Nicole. Nicole, baby, are you okay?<eos> Did they touch you?<eos> No, I'm okay.<eos> Listen, I'm gonna come get you out of there, okay, as soon as...
Andy, you don't have to do this.<eos> Let me call CTU.<eos> They'll back you up.<eos> I'm asking you... to find another way.<eos> I don't want to lose you.
Knew the people to call.<eos> 'Cause you've done this before, haven't you?<eos> Another day at the office.<eos> It's not like that, John.<eos> I look at you and I don't even know who you are anymore.
- Right? I got no clue how ugly it's gonna get, but I'm-a go after Eric<eos> - 'cause I love him.<eos> - No.<eos> I'm not just gonna stand here while you go off and save my husband.<eos> Eric gave himself up to save you.
John?<eos> It's okay, Dad.<eos> It's okay.<eos> There you go.<eos> Oh, let's get you home.
It's okay, Dad.<eos> It's okay.<eos> There you go.<eos> Oh, let's get you home.<eos> Let's get you home.
Okay.<eos> Give him another dose.<eos> I see that you were able to organize this really quick.<eos> It's not like that, John.<eos> I look at you and I don't even know who you are anymore.
I'll let Director Mullins know.<eos> Hey.<eos> I was gonna call you.<eos> Um...<eos> My wife decided to stay home, so I can't see you tonight.
I want to go home.<eos> Well, I'll take you.<eos> You don't have to.<eos> Come on.<eos> Let me take you home.
My fault.<eos> I put you both in impossible situations.<eos> But it's all water under the bridge now.<eos> Water under the bridge?<eos> I never meant to compromise you, John.
Not that I'm justifying what he did.<eos> I'm-I'm not, but...<eos> Desperation can make you do terrible things.<eos> And it can make you keep them from the people you love because because you don't want them to see that part of you.<eos> Rebecca, I may not know you like I thought I did, but I do know one thing.
I'm-I'm not, but...<eos> Desperation can make you do terrible things.<eos> And it can make you keep them from the people you love because because you don't want them to see that part of you.<eos> Rebecca, I may not know you like I thought I did, but I do know one thing.<eos> I don't want to lose you.

He killed the asset's family.<eos> Carter found them.<eos> Naseri.<eos> Be quiet.<eos> You think I wouldn't recognize you after what you did?
Just make sure Luis doesn't go anywhere.<eos> Rebecca...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You look like a ghost.<eos> I told you, give John some time.
I do.<eos> Then why did you keep this from me?<eos> I was just... I was trying to find the right time to tell you.<eos> I was, Nicole.<eos> I'm not here to put you on the spot, but I think this is important.
They want to show the world that they can defeat the woman who tried to destroy them.<eos> They're gonna want to kill me themselves.<eos> You want to use yourself as bait.<eos> And I want you to finish them off.<eos> Find somewhere that they can't see you and take them out.
And you're a liar.<eos> I wonder if you really don't know what I'm talking about.<eos> I'd tell you to ask her, but you're never gonna see her again.<eos> What is it?<eos> If I'd been at your side from the beginning, maybe this wouldn't have happened to you.
All right, all right, all right.<eos> Fine.<eos> You came here to get an answer from Eric.<eos> You got your answer.<eos> I don't like seeing you like this.
Sir, Senator Donovan is on the phone.<eos> I need the room.<eos> Senator.<eos> Hello, Don.<eos> I can't tell you how relieved I am to know that you're safe.
Ara. That's a beautiful name.<eos> My name is Eric, and I'm here to help you.<eos> Help?<eos> What these people did to you is wrong.<eos> Okay? I'm here to take you home.
Come on.<eos> Ara, I need you to stay in here while I take care of something.<eos> - Okay?<eos> - Those people...<eos> I'm gonna do everything I can to protect you,
Because I have it, too.<eos> We all do.<eos> The people who do this work... it's a gift.<eos> Oh, and it's a curse.<eos> And it'll eat you alive if you don't deal with it.
I'm your father.<eos> I know who you are.<eos> I'm trying to understand... how this... happened.<eos> How... how I let this happen.<eos> I told myself I was protecting you, but now I...
So that you would reconsider what I said last night about staying in the race.<eos> He never gives up.<eos> Never gives up.<eos> If you drop out, I will turn myself in to the authorities.<eos> I would have done it before if I had thought there was any way to keep you out of it.
This is...<eos> This is where I belong.<eos> I get that.<eos> And if this is what you need... then I want to make it work.<eos> I'm not gonna lose you, Eric.
- I'm your fucking wife!<eos> - Then we're all lying!<eos> - Tell me the truth!<eos> - Dad, what do you do?<eos> - I told you, I fly UAV's. Drones.
Van Damn.<eos> Okay, so I will, uh, call...<eos> Van Damn. Just...<eos> - Capheus!<eos> Someone's looking for you.
Big house.<eos> The horse seems to know what he wants, like he can read his thoughts.<eos> It's like they share one mind.<eos> Wouldn't that make it easier?<eos> Of course, then you'd know all the wicked things I was hoping to do to you before I lose you to Chicago.
Sorry.<eos> You can feel it, can't you?<eos> I'm close.<eos> I just wish there was another way.<eos> Does she realize she's protecting you to death?
The seagulls might as well have been speaking Icelandic.<eos> The jar of skyr?<eos> We even know the fucking farm it came from:<eos> Three Sisters.<eos> But none of that is as colossal a mistake as you hiding here.
You could never lie to me.<eos> It's difficult, but I believe it'll work out.<eos> This will help a lot.<eos> I know you can't tell me what you're going through... but there's a lot of talk back home.<eos> And you know I trust you.
Clever, Mr. Gorski.<eos> You mean, for a Chicago cop.<eos> - I underestimated you.<eos> - It's all right, I get that a lot.<eos> Allow me to congratulate you.
I'd never met anyone like Angelica.<eos> Ithoughtat first the sensate connection I experienced had something to do with the building.<eos> I came back to try and understand if I was losing my mind, and I found her.<eos> How can this be?<eos> You're here, and I can touch you.
A temporary solution to a long-term problem.<eos> BPO.<eos> - How do you avoid them?<eos> - You don't.<eos> But they're not hunting you.
That's not happening.<eos> I have friends who could make sure you're kept safe.<eos> It's far too dangerous.<eos> No, I don't think it's possible.<eos> Well, you better watch out for this guy 'cause he will talk you into and out of anything.
This way.<eos> - Six months...<eos> - Rajan?<eos> Why is there a security man with a machine gun following me?<eos> I tried to call you, but your phone has been switched off.
We should go.<eos> This taste of freedom was delicious.<eos> But enough is enough.<eos> - No.<eos> - I will only slow you down.
Listen, the hardest part is getting the samples without a leash around my neck.<eos> But lucky you seem to already have yours, the latest ones with less side effects.<eos> Seems like somebody might have a friend at BPO.<eos> Wait.<eos> Blockers aren't gonna keep you safe forever, Riley Blue. Not from BPO.
- Lila, why are you still talking to him?<eos> - I know what I'm doing.<eos> You said we needed each other, but as soon as I ask you for something, you walk away.<eos> Be smart.<eos> - How long has he been after you?
And I did my best to convince them that you were beyond saving.<eos> - They wanted to see it by themselves.<eos> Dad, Mom... what are you doing here?<eos> You're our daughter.<eos> We've come to take you home.
♪ Maybe you'll wanna give me kisses sweet ♪ - Hi.<eos> - One sec.<eos> ♪ But only for one night with no repeat ♪ - Is it Will again?<eos> ♪ And maybe you'll go away And never call ♪ Listen, I just want to know what the plan is in case the ID doesn't work out.<eos> I'm telling you, it's the best one I've ever done.
I don't have two minutes for you.<eos> Okay. All right, that's fine.<eos> Will you just answer me one question?<eos> What?<eos> How many times did the Feds or Homeland Security call you in for questioning?
But I'm not afraid.<eos> I know.<eos> That's why I'm crying.<eos> Your teacher told me he's never seen a fighter as fearless as my daughter.<eos> When I watch you and I see your fierce determination...
Why?<eos> My mother.<eos> Come.<eos> Sit with me.<eos> I want to talk to you about your father.
- I really think I needed to do this before I was ready.<eos> Well, I wish you would have talked to us first.<eos> Why?<eos> Look, I'm not gonna coddle you.<eos> This agency no longer represents you.
- I'm sorry.<eos> - Goddamn it.<eos> Will, no. No, stop.<eos> - This is our last chance!<eos> - If they put a bullet in you, it will be.
I don't have a job.<eos> And I can't get a job because I don't have an agent.<eos> Why don't I have an agent?<eos> Because he could see what you both refuse to see.<eos> One of these days, that shit-for-brains is going to realize that dropping you was the sorriest, stupidest mistake he's ever made.
- What? What did he say?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> Why do you think she would be listed as a missing person?<eos> We know she was scared.<eos> We know she went through a lot of trouble to meet with you.
Why do you think she would be listed as a missing person?<eos> We know she was scared.<eos> We know she went through a lot of trouble to meet with you.<eos> - Which means that...<eos> - Whoever's after you is probably after her.
For six months, I trained with the best bartenders in all Mexico.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> For my role in Blood-Stained Tequila.<eos> Relaxing, isn't it?<eos> I feel I can talk to you, Wolfgang.
Thank God. Fredrick said you were with him.<eos> With who?<eos> I don't know what's going on.<eos> I'm trying to understand it.<eos> I received a call from Khalial, who's going to make a move on you.
- You and your lady should be careful.<eos> - Is this is a warning?<eos> Bossman don't do no warnings, Van Damn.<eos> He just comes for you.<eos> I could get offed just for talking to you.
I could get offed just for talking to you.<eos> Why are you talking to me then?<eos> 'Cause I still like you, Van Damn.<eos> I shouldn't.<eos> For what you did to me... I should have killed you.
[voice echoing] Leave me the fuck alone! No.<eos> You're just as trapped as we are, aren't you?<eos> [Lila] It's Sebastian.<eos> He's worried about your relationship.<eos> I told him I would talk to you.
Hey, man, look at you.<eos> Van Damn!<eos> Mom?<eos> Oh, my son.<eos> If your father could see you now.
- Oh, my God!<eos> That's Blake Huntington.<eos> Please, guys. Guys, please.<eos> Please, please. Come on. Act normal.<eos> Blakey, I wanted to be the first to introduce you.
No, I...<eos> I fucked up.<eos> And it won't happen again.<eos> And don't worry.<eos> He's not gonna hurt you.
Let's go around back.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Predictable.<eos> What have you gotten me into?<eos> I don't want to hurt you.
- Oh.<eos> - Ha! Four in a row.<eos> I win again.<eos> Van Damn!<eos> It's good to see you, Amondi.
I want to know why your men have been following me.<eos> Can I offer you a drink?<eos> No, thank you.<eos> - I'll have a bourbon.<eos> I should have told you about my men, but I knew if I did, you would have said you didn't want them.
I should have been there.<eos> Where?<eos> When you got shot.<eos> I wish I was there.<eos> Maybe I could've... protected you.
No!<eos> Leave us alone.<eos> I know what day it is. But anniversary or not, this year I refuse!<eos> I'm not letting you out, and I am not feeding you.
I'm not letting you out, and I am not feeding you.<eos> And you must be quiet!<eos> I know that you know, that my granddaughter is in this house, visiting.<eos> She's innocent like I was.<eos> And she's gonna stay that way, and there's nothing, nothing, nothing you can do, because I will destroy you before you touch her!
Rocks? Close.<eos> Crystals, brimstones.<eos> I'm dating this guy who's really obsessed with the whole psychic vibe thing.<eos> Hey, you want a tarot card reading?<eos> Maybe I can tell you how long you an Paul will be together.
- What is this?<eos> - It's a necklace.<eos> It's used to ward off evil. For protection.<eos> Will it protect me against you?<eos> Nothing can protect you from me.
Hey. It's Karen.<eos> Leave a message. Or don't. Beep.<eos> Karen, hey, it's me.<eos> Listen, call me back when you get this. I wanna...<eos> I wanna talk to you more about Paul.
Is there anybody else here with you?<eos> No.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> I chased them away with my sadness.<eos> And I'll chase you away, too.
Stay away from each other.<eos> And I don't wanna hear no talking between you.<eos> You got that? Huh? You got it?<eos> Daya, look.<eos> You can't let these guards see you like this.
- There.<eos> - I see it.<eos> Here we go.<eos> This is fun.<eos> Rory, you have to move, it's gonna hit you.
You can do that but make sure to protect the glove.<eos> - Shit.<eos> - It's gripping the glass. Okay. Okay.<eos> Little son of a...<eos> - How hard is he holding on to you?
Adamsss!<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - David, I need you here.<eos> Rory...<eos> I can't let you out.
Kat?<eos> - No comments.<eos> I've got to jump.<eos> David, I've taken care of the channel.<eos> She is not gonna tell you, but her heart is beating out of her chest.
I mean that in the best possible sense.<eos> Uh, all hail. Everyone clap.<eos> I have known what you truly are since the day we met.<eos> Long may you reign.<eos> I feel it's incumbent upon me to promise never again to betray you like I did.
I have some character defects.<eos> I'm working on it.<eos> Honestly.<eos> - I'm working on some too.<eos> - Well, on that note, I crown you queen Alice the wise.
- Now that we're ruling a kingdom together,<eos> I hope we can be whatever we were again.<eos> - I guess you could call that friends.<eos> - Let's go with that.<eos> I hereby crown you king Quentin the moderately socially maladjusted.
- Alice.<eos> - Apology accepted.<eos> That was you apologizing for what you did.<eos> I just... If we survive this, I hope we can be friends still.<eos> I know it may sound stupid, but that's what I'm mad at you for, not... not the cheating part.
- Apology accepted.<eos> That was you apologizing for what you did.<eos> I just... If we survive this, I hope we can be friends still.<eos> I know it may sound stupid, but that's what I'm mad at you for, not... not the cheating part.<eos> The part where what you did made me lose you.
I can show you how.<eos> - No, thank you.<eos> - Do let me know if you change your mind.<eos> - Eliot!<eos> The crown suits you, of course.
- Why do you want to help me with my shade?<eos> - Without your shade, you would see a lot of things differently.<eos> You'd be able to live, Julia.<eos> Come here.<eos> Let me show you.
- Stop it. Listen..<eos> - I have a special gift for you.<eos> What is it?<eos> You will need these..<eos> This is protection for you.
Dinner is on the table, Rohan.<eos> Have a little before going to bed.<eos> 'Your wife is so good that she can starve for you..'<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Rohan, I'm not forcing you, but we have a deadline to meet.
'We will come whenever we want.'<eos> 'Come on, let's try something new today.'<eos> 'I know how hard this is for you' 'and I love you so much'<eos> 'but just so that you don't have to face this suffering again' 'I must go.'<eos> 'The only thing I regret' 'is that I am leaving you alone.'
Should I book a room?<eos> Come on!<eos> We'll have fun.<eos> You're a dead man.<eos> I'll kill you.
Come on!<eos> We'll have fun.<eos> You're a dead man.<eos> I'll kill you.<eos> So what if you're my friend's son? I'll kill you.
Think about it. Did I ever talk to you like that in all these years?<eos> No, right?<eos> Just meet me once.<eos> I want to meet you and clear everything.<eos> I don't want to meet you.
Actually, it was my college friend.<eos> What if dad found out?<eos> Can't you even bear a slap for my sake?<eos> Okay, I apologise.<eos> I'll apologise to you personally if you want.
Hey!<eos> You didn't kill Supriya.<eos> - No..<eos> So, I won't kill you.<eos> Do you know who'll kill you?
Why are you being so kind to me today?<eos> That's not the case, Shelar.<eos> You won't understand. But I've always helped you.<eos> After that rape, when you called me up I handed those two over to Nalawde.<eos> I knew that he'd hand them back to you.
Tell me his name.<eos> I'll hand him over to you in the morning.<eos> Not in the morning!<eos> Right now!<eos> If I tell you right now, you will not believe me.
Hey, Teena!<eos> This is amazing!<eos> You have a barbecue?<eos> Bethie, you're missing it.<eos> Don't let your mum see you.
Marteen McGuire, new patient, she came in last night?<eos> Are you family?<eos> Sir, are you family?<eos> My favourite is Duffy Duck.<eos> Mum needs you inside.
[IT IS OVER]<eos> Pay up!<eos> Relax, Jimmy!<eos> It's OK.<eos> Spend it fast. Cos I'm gonna do you, just like I did Teena.
I couldn't travel with it, so I brought these.<eos> I had two worms in the cab ride over here, enough to relax me without turning me into Cheech Chong.<eos> Do... do you want one?<eos> No, thank you.<eos> I actually have to talk to you about something.
Do you have any idea of what my life is like on a day-to-day basis?<eos> Yeah, you teach and you have all your cool new Weight Watchers friends...<eos> I can't even go to the movies anymore because I hate coming home.<eos> I sit in the driveway in the car because I don't wanna go inside the house.<eos> 'Cause you're scared someone's waiting to attack you?
Yeah, a baby.<eos> For real?<eos> I mean, I was not gonna tell you like this, but, yeah.<eos> It's a fucking miracle of life.<eos> Elijah, come on. I was going to tell you.
It's, uh, so good to see you.<eos> D-do you get some coffee here, too?<eos> Well, yeah. It... it's right across the street.<eos> I guess it is.<eos> Hey, I'm sorry you couldn't come to the meeting, but I can fill you in on all the ideas that came out of it... a lot of them about preserving the architectural history of the village.
It made the local news.<eos> I'm so sorry you had to hear about it this way.<eos> Ah, Mr. Davidson.<eos> You need a room again for a few hours?<eos> No. I came to see you.
Why aren't you starting the car?<eos> It's hard laying down back here.<eos> Mother, get back down, now.<eos> The people I was having dinner with are just a few cars away.<eos> They might see you.
I'm not here to engage in idle banter, John.<eos> We must be off.<eos> And where are we going?<eos> To the time machine.<eos> I'm obliged to take you back to Scotland Yard to face the consequences of your actions.
Then you handed me a letter.<eos> You said for me to find the time machine.<eos> I wrote you a letter?<eos> No, you wrote youa letter.<eos> You knew you wouldn't believe you either.
What?<eos> You didn't think I was gonna go alone now, did you?<eos> No. No!<eos> Let her go, John.<eos> I thought I might see you here.
I took the shirt you were wearing when you first arrived and had a genealogy test done from the blood and DNA on it.<eos> The preliminary results are back, and I'm not really sure how, but you and I... We're family.<eos> I wish I could offer you more.<eos> Some form of insight into how we're related.<eos> When you showed up in my life all those years ago, I didn't believe you.
I want to suck every part of your body.<eos> Nothing about you disgusts me.<eos> - Recently... - There are moments...<eos> - ...<eos> I dreamed I was inside you.
- I could feel inside you.<eos> - So I can be you.<eos> You are me.<eos> I am you.<eos> I love breathing you.
No!<eos> Give it to me!<eos> Stop!<eos> Don't open it yet!<eos> - I'll kill you!
- No, I'll have it.<eos> - What?<eos> Are you stupid?<eos> Look at it, please.<eos> But, Laura, your father will kill you.
So you've been cheating on him with me.<eos> Technically, yes.<eos> If he hadn't appeared, would you have told me?<eos> Yes, I would.<eos> Carlos, I'd have told you but you were showing me the masks.
What a pain.<eos> You're making a mess of that.<eos> Let me do it.<eos> I told Alex that Susana fancies him and wants to screw him.<eos> She'll kill you.
The Italian futurist.<eos> - You know him? - Of course.<eos> They say he was killed falling off a horse, but I think it was suicide.<eos> My turn.<eos> There's a room full of paintings with people who seem to look at you as if you'd killed someone.
Are you okay?<eos> A bit dizzy.<eos> We'll talk tomorrow.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I wanted to see you.
I don't know why on earth I said<eos> "economically independent" to a child of seven.<eos> He hasn't come out for three weeks.<eos> Maybe you can persuade him.<eos> Carlos, my son, look who's come to see you.
- You are me.<eos> - I could feel inside you.<eos> - There are moments,<eos> - when I want to stop being me...<eos> - I dreamed I was inside you.
I want to suck every part of your body.<eos> Nothing about you disgusts me.<eos> - Recently...<eos> - There are moments...<eos> - ... I dreamed I was inside you.
Yeah.<eos> You're okay now.<eos> - Sorry we fought last night.<eos> - Me too.<eos> I shouldn't have followed you to that restaurant.

It's your brother.<eos> Why... why did you keep this from me?<eos> Because I didn't know what to do.<eos> You just had a blackout.<eos> I didn't want to catapult you into another one.
But now...<eos> Tell Mom bye. Tell her I'm sorry.<eos> - And I'm gonna...<eos> - You're gonna what?<eos> Your mother can't lose you too, son.
Why? You need to get out of there... both of you. Right now.<eos> - _ - DEA agent Mike Hall.<eos> - You there?<eos> - Yeah. They're coming at me. It's only a matter of time before they come for you, too,<eos> - Whoa... who's... - Who's coming at you?
_<eos> That's his phone.<eos> Incoming call. 703 area code.<eos> You and Lianne on the road yet?<eos> You know I can't just leave you hanging out there.
What! You still haven't finished?<eos> You've still got the face pack on?<eos> Kanan's flight has landed.<eos> Kanan is here!<eos> "My eyes have twinkled today." "My kohled eyes await you."
I wasn't.. I wasn't talking to you.<eos> Who were you talking to then?<eos> Who else is here?<eos> Wait.. Look..<eos> There is.. There is something I need to tell you.
Anu..<eos> 'You can change the way people think.'<eos> 'But you..' 'You sing meaningless songs.'<eos> Don't get married to me as a favour.<eos> I don't want to force you into sharing your life with me.
I've raised you like my daughter.<eos> I educated you so that you could read the Holy Book. So that you can differentiate right from wrong.<eos> I didn't get married so that I could give you all my love.<eos> What did I do wrong that you punished me like this?<eos> He's not worthy of you.
You had asked him to do this, hadn't you?<eos> You would've remained in the shadows and he could've become famous<eos> and made a lot of money.<eos> But he didn't do that.<eos> He is worthy of you.
He is worthy of you.<eos> He values and respects you.<eos> How can I refuse to let my sister marry such a man?<eos> He will be here on Baisakhi. Your groom.<eos> This brother of yours will give you away in style.
- She likes you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - There..<eos> Why are you here?<eos> - Didn't I tell you, the tree..
I'll tell you what happened.<eos> I was in the parking lot at a Phish show, cutting up some salami with my pocketknife, when the pigs nabbed me for dealing.<eos> Pigs?<eos> What is this, 1969?<eos> I'm telling you, man, the only thing I assaulted that day was some nice Soppresatta.
AMI, please come say hello to Agent Booth and Dr. Brennan.<eos> That's... really amazing.<eos> Hello, Agent Booth,<eos> Dr. Brennan.<eos> I am very pleased to meet you.
I-I don't know.<eos> Oh. Dad. What are you doing here?<eos> My party doesn't start for another seven hours.<eos> Well, I had to run some errands, and I thought, why not swing by and have some one-on-one time with my favorite daughter.<eos> It's nice to see you.
Yes.<eos> But you made such a big deal about me not being a genius.<eos> Well, I did do a rather remarkable acting job, didn't I?<eos> Uh, yeah, well, you certainly had me fooled.<eos> I tell you, Bones, keeping a secret is not one of your strong suits.
He means Red Hudmore.<eos> He moved in last week.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Go pork yourself.<eos> Cam, I was just about to call you.
Look, I want nothing more than to marry you, and I know how much you want to be a father.<eos> Cam, can we talk about this later?<eos> Not really.<eos> Biologically speaking, our options begin to shrink in the not so distant future.<eos> I hear you, but when I look at you, all I see are limitless possibilities.
I don't know why you're not getting this.<eos> You have to make the call now, Mellie, before too much time goes by!<eos> You wait too long, the press out there is gonna say you're ungracious.<eos> They're gonna label you a sore loser.<eos> And because you're a woman, half of them are gonna call you a bitch, and half of them are gonna report that you cried.
Charlie, Quinn doesn't want to go to the Caribbean with you because she's a workaholic<eos> - and she's afraid of the ocean.<eos> - I am not.<eos> Quinn, Charlie wants to take you to the Caribbean so he can propose to you.<eos> Unless he wants to kill you.
I'm almost done decoding the deleted voicemail from the server.<eos> Did you try them?<eos> I-i-i would, but I'm just really close to decoding this.<eos> Something is wrong.<eos> I just told you to stop what you're doing and call them, so that's what you should be...
- I didn't kill that man, Michael.<eos> - The evidence says you did.<eos> - I was set up.<eos> - Swear to me.<eos> I swear to you, Michael.
I'm looking for someone...<eos> Guy named Lincoln Burrows.<eos> Why you want to see Burrows so bad anyhow?<eos> 'Cause he's my brother.<eos> - I'm getting you out of here.
You just as pretty as advertised.<eos> When do we get started?<eos> - I need your help.<eos> - You're asking me to break the law.<eos> I'm asking you to make a mistake.
Big tough guy... who made it out of the neighborhood.<eos> And look at you now...<eos> Back to your roots, the way you've always been.<eos> A small-time crook who can't pay his debts.<eos> We're gonna find you, you know, and we're gonna open you up.
No return address.<eos> If you're playing me, I'll kill you.<eos> Take a look at that postmark on that.<eos> I may be a sophisti-cat, but not so sophisticated as to forge something like that.<eos> Besides... what angle could I possibly have in coming here and telling you that it looks like your brother might just be alive?
Chicago.<eos> Love Chicago.<eos> - There you go.<eos> - Thanks, man.<eos> I didn't think I was ever gonna see you again.
Jacob.<eos> I haven't seen you in what, three, four years?<eos> - Yeah. - Uncle Lincoln!<eos> Hey-hey! Buddy!<eos> Oh... so good to see you.
What?<eos> Sara, someone just tried to kill me.<eos> They've been watching. They've been watching,<eos> - probably for...<eos> - Who tried to kill you?
We go to Hong Kong, Spain, Buenos Aires, basically wherever the boss tells us.<eos> Corrupt son of a bitch.<eos> Well, I suggest you get back on that tramp,<eos> - 'cause you're not coming.<eos> - I'm telling you,
Can't they?<eos> Question is, if they come back, is it the same storm, or has something changed?<eos> New tats.<eos> What do you mean, new?<eos> We're gonna get you out of here.
I'm glad you could go.<eos> I tried to talk to her on the flight but she wasn't ready.<eos> I can understand that.<eos> What couldn't you tell me over the phone?<eos> It's just easier if I show you.
Hanna, with your clothes on her back you'll be in the "Sunday Times" dial section before you know it.<eos> Sorry, you're hurting me.<eos> - My shoulder.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> I am just so happy to see you.
She told me that it, it happened before, but this time they knew who the father was.<eos> Because Mary told them.<eos> Apparently, your father was in a restaurant when Jessica walked in or who he thought was Jessica.<eos> Dad did this to you.<eos> He did this to you again?
Were you there when I was born?<eos> Close by.<eos> Hi.<eos> Five minutes.<eos> You were in this world five minutes before I first held you.
- 'How are you? '<eos> - Ezra.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - You remember Holden.<eos> Hey, it's great to see you again.
- Ezra.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - You remember Holden.<eos> Hey, it's great to see you again.<eos> Hey, yeah. Good to see you too.
Um, Nicole's parents called me, and they want me back up there.<eos> - Sure.<eos> - But I-I won't be long.<eos> - Great.<eos> Okay. - Great seeing you.
I'll tag you.<eos> Did I hear that correctly?<eos> Well, I know what I heard.<eos> What did you hear?<eos> Well, it sounded like Mona was trying to push you off the label.
So you swap people away like they are bugs.<eos> Please.<eos> Just go away.<eos> That's what you want me to do?<eos> God, Ali why do we have to keep showing you that we love you?
Call me after you've had your coffee.<eos> Alright, "Twelfth Night" paper is due on Friday.<eos> If you haven't picked a theme, please do so.<eos> It helps if you actually read the play.<eos> Can I talk to you?
Nineteen.<eos> The beading, the belt, the collar.<eos> Hanna, Claudia Greco was a dragon.<eos> She stole your soul for three years not to mention our relationship.<eos> I mean, the least that she could give you was a belt.
Yes, I do.<eos> How are you with tabbouleh?<eos> Bulgur's there, parsley's done.<eos> Tomatoes just need to be chopped.<eos> Can I trust you with a knife?
Can I just say one more thing that's like really bugging me?<eos> Besides the fact that you can't say Nicole's name?<eos> I can.<eos> I just don't really like to.<eos> So what else bugs you?
Did Ezra propose to her first?<eos> Y-you wrote a book with the guy.<eos> You've known him forever.<eos> Why would he keep that a secret?<eos> Don't you think he would have told you?
Well, I don't see why it matters now.<eos> You've got the ring.<eos> So why does he keep putting it off?<eos> She still doesn't even know that we're engaged.<eos> Is Ezra the only person who's ever told you he loved you?
' Marin.<eos> Look, you're sitting at my old desk if she doesn't wanna talk to me, then...<eos> _<eos> How could she just walk in there?<eos> I'll tell you how, because she has balls the size of church bells.
Look, I'm sorry. I guess she's been to seventh circle of hell and just keeps getting...<eos> Emily?<eos> Em, are you there?<eos> Yes, and so is Jenna with bookends.<eos> I'll call you back.
What?<eos> When?<eos> We figured the sooner the better.<eos> Severing ties with this town would be healthy for all of us.<eos> I didn't tell you this morning because I...
Probably some poor kid who got off the bus three stops early because they couldn't deal with your dirty looks or the sounds of your snickering two rows behind them.<eos> You wanna know what's inappropriate, Addison?<eos> You.<eos> You're inappropriate!<eos> And you need to be stopped because I was that kid on the bus, and I will not let you...
How about why'd you run away?<eos> I'm calling from Mr. Hastings office.<eos> - What happened? - Um...<eos> Nicole found the book.<eos> And she threw it at you?
No, at her parents...<eos> When they came to take her back.<eos> Did Nicole write this?<eos> "This memory of us kept me alive.<eos> I can't tell you how many nights I thought about you and our love, and I knew that I had to be strong.
Doesn't have to be.<eos> I thought I was over high school.<eos> But it's really hard to be over a place when you're smack dab in it and it feels like so much hasn't changed.<eos> You and Allie are still keeping secrets.<eos> I told you, it's not what you think it is.
Maybe at a neighbor's house or...<eos> No, sorry.<eos> I guess we wrote down the wrong address.<eos> I'm glad you did.<eos> I can't tell you how great it is to see you.
Don't judge I'm old.<eos> Well I'll send you my contact we should get coffee at the Bradley.<eos> I can bring my mom.<eos> That'd be wonderful.<eos> Well, it's good to see you.
You shot Spencer.<eos> You help Jenna escape.<eos> - You made up the game?<eos> - Correct.<eos> I barely know you, Sydney, why are you doing this?
So what happens next?<eos> How do I get out?<eos> There is no out.<eos> But you could change sides, be a part of the winning team.<eos> You want me to join you in torturing my friends?
Now, do you understand why I don't want you to find her why I want to keep her away from this family?<eos> You knew about Charlotte before the doll house?<eos> I'll be damned if I ever let something like that happen to you again.<eos> Now, you can hate me, Spencer, I can live with that.<eos> But please, please, let me protect you.
He's not gonna find it.<eos> What, guys aren't gonna go through a girl's purse because they're too afraid to accidently touch a tampon.<eos> Okay, well, how long are we gonna keep this game a secret?<eos> I mean, A.D. practically dragged Paige into the middle of it...<eos> Uh, so, Mona wasn't kidding when she said she'll get you in the "Style" section.
- It is. Actually, I was just reading about certain drug therapies that have proven successful in cases like hers.<eos> Uh, antidepressants uh, stimulants, dopamine agonist.<eos> Yeah, I know, the-the specialists have mentioned a few of those things, but, hey, I-I don't mean to cut this short but I do need to get back to the hospital.<eos> Sure. Absolutely.<eos> But it's good to see you.
Yeah, I know, the-the specialists have mentioned a few of those things, but, hey, I-I don't mean to cut this short but I do need to get back to the hospital.<eos> Sure. Absolutely.<eos> But it's good to see you.<eos> - Hi. Detective.<eos> Toby, it's really good to see you up on your feet.
- Where?<eos> - Come with me and find out.<eos> It's the weekend, I actually have the day off.<eos> And a little activity might be good for your shoulder.<eos> And it might help you get your mind off of everything that's been twisting' you up lately.
Look, you guys don't have to stay.<eos> They're gonna keep him on oxygen a little while longer and then release him in an hour or two.<eos> Sydney's on the move.<eos> I'll take first watch and follow her tonight.<eos> Come on, I'll drop you off.
I'll take first watch and follow her tonight.<eos> Come on, I'll drop you off.<eos> Can you call me back, please?<eos> Sabrina just quit...<eos> Um, guess she tried to get a hold of you...
"Solve the puzzle and get away with murder."<eos> "Or fail and go directly to jail."<eos> Cops get one more clue about what we did..<eos> It's game over.<eos> All that talk about Lucas backing you all the way, he's selling your business out from under you before we've even started.
Well, I was pushing Moscow Mules at the Radley for a while I know where all the paper work is.<eos> I mean, the codes on the doors change weekly, but...<eos> I can get them.<eos> My mom's office.<eos> - What if someone sees you?
We owe it to her.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> What does that mean, Hanna?<eos> I don't think that she would have self-sabotaged that night if it wasn't for everything going on with the three of us.<eos> I was there behind the door when you were begging her to let you in.
It's not Lucas.<eos> The apartment's different than how I pictured it.<eos> Don't.<eos> Just say what you came here to say.<eos> Look, I didn't exactly expect a warm welcome but it's-it's hard to talk to you when you're looking at me like that.
Just for a minute.<eos> Please.<eos> Can't you just be a human being?<eos> Okay?<eos> I'm not asking you to help me.
Please.<eos> Can't you just be a human being?<eos> Okay?<eos> I'm not asking you to help me.<eos> I am not asking you to lie for me.
No, Furey is building a case.<eos> What if he goes back and talks to him?<eos> Lucas will make sure that we're rotting in jail before' we ever find anything else to prove that he's torturing us.<eos> It's not Lucas.<eos> Hanna, he just threw you under the bus.
Lucas will make sure that we're rotting in jail before' we ever find anything else to prove that he's torturing us.<eos> It's not Lucas.<eos> Hanna, he just threw you under the bus.<eos> - I don't care.<eos> - Shall I rewind it so we can see him back it over you?
Isn't it?<eos> You weren't drinking at that bar to celebrate.<eos> I'm gonna go get some rest.<eos> Wait, Spencer.<eos> Hanna and I aren't gonna let you down this time.
They still don't trust me?<eos> Fine, I'll help you and your friends like I always do and then crawl back under a rock.<eos> Mona, come on, it's not like that.<eos> I have literally bled myself for you, Hanna.<eos> Trying to protect you.
I think so.<eos> - What happened?<eos> - Someone knocked me down.<eos> They flew past me so fast I didn't get to see who it was.<eos> I'm gonna get you home, okay?
I just..<eos> I had trouble getting other people to take a chance on you.<eos> Well, what about the investors?<eos> You're lookin' at him.<eos> I was too embarrassed to tell you that I couldn't do it anymore.
Me?<eos> I was scared you were gonna tear Lucas' head off.<eos> I thought he was A.D.<eos> Besides, you were the one that used a Pottery Barn candlestick as a deadly weapon.<eos> I don't know why I thought I had to protect you.
But then again, I remember how adept you and your friends are at that sort of thing.<eos> - That's not fair.<eos> - Fairness. It's overrated.<eos> Truth is what counts.<eos> Well, I would say that it's good to see you but under these circumstances...
Why?<eos> Mom, you've spent your whole life helping me.<eos> Doing things you shouldn't have had to do.<eos> Because I love you.<eos> And now it's time for me to show you how much I love you by not letting you get involved.
You're free to go home.<eos> Hope you get a good night's sleep.<eos> - You disappointed me.<eos> - I disappointed you?<eos> I agreed to meet you, but you weren't careful.
There was so much less to worry about.<eos> I'm really sorry that I involved you in this mess.<eos> Which mess, in particular?<eos> All of it.<eos> May be we should have never told you about the night that Dunhill died, and...
I'm really sorry that I involved you in this mess.<eos> Which mess, in particular?<eos> All of it.<eos> May be we should have never told you about the night that Dunhill died, and...<eos> I shouldn't have asked you help me trash his credit card receipts.
I was so angry when I wrote that.<eos> I know.<eos> And, and you should have been angry.<eos> The... the book I was writing about Alison where we met, andand I started...<eos> I started this relationship by lying to you.
Most of which I am not happy about.<eos> And tomorrow it's gonna be all hands on deck.<eos> I've already got a call into a new lawyer and I...<eos> But tonight...<eos> I'm just gonna be happy that you have found a man who loves you and wants to protect you.
He texted Ezra to meet me.<eos> Dark night of the soul, Aria?<eos> It was. Yeah.<eos> Until I realized something.<eos> There's a way for me to get you out of my life.
Where are we?<eos> Mona lives a block away.<eos> You've reached Spencer.<eos> Please, leave a message.<eos> Spence, I'm on my way to you right now.
You're dead.<eos> You know everything.<eos> Who is A.D.?<eos> God, you're no help.<eos> I should have just let that cop find you.
- Do what?<eos> I can make it up to them, I can take the blame.<eos> First of all, I'm-I'm not interested in you making any more sacrifices for your friends.<eos> Second, Aria, you have an alibi, you're in the clear.<eos> There's nothing linking you to what happened with Dunhill.
That's how she got out.<eos> Yeah, maybe that's how Mona got out the night that Charlotte was killed.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - No, not you.<eos> I'm not letting you down any more holes.
I can't leave my friends.<eos> I think they gave up the right to be your friends.<eos> No, they haven't.<eos> I'm the one who made the bad choice.<eos> When someone puts you in a box and nails the lid shut part of you will always be locked in that box in the dark afraid and crying, but... you can't let that trap part do the thinking for you.
Hanna wasn't here.<eos> Charlotte was.<eos> The night Charlotte was released?<eos> The night you called her?<eos> Why would she want to meet you here?
Because she had to.<eos> You brought flowers?<eos> Is that why you wanted to see me?<eos> To welcome me home with flowers?<eos> I couldn't give them to you in the hospital.
We've got to get you out of here right now.<eos> Okay, you got to give me some direction here, you know?<eos> Some, um... fatherly advice on how to deal with having a father that's, um... you.<eos> Well, you know, uh...<eos> Is this blood freaking you out like it's freaking me out?
I-I don't know how to say it, so, um...<eos> That man was a police detective, and he told me your moth... your mother's dead.<eos> What?<eos> I know. I know.<eos> But I'm gonna take you somewhere safe, where those people that are trying to hurt you can't reach you.
Why would they try and hurt me?<eos> It's because I love you.<eos> And they're trying to hurt me...<eos> Take the one thing that I truly love away.<eos> Why would they try and hurt you?
It's okay.<eos> Would you please show him your credentials, Agent Blake?<eos> Agent Emily Blake, CIA.<eos> I'm sorry that had to happen in front of you at the house.<eos> She was stationed at the house to protect you... from exactly the man who ended up coming, the man who said he was your dad.
Maybe tossed.<eos> You and your damn zoo, Scofield.<eos> I'm gonna find out once and for all what you were really doing there.<eos> What you were really planning.<eos> And then I'm gonna kill you.
It's what's behind the eyes that counts.<eos> Yeah. Thought you should know I'm looking at your closed servers right now.<eos> I'm holding your hard drives in my hand.<eos> All your secret communications.<eos> Enough to send you away forever.
Time for the real dance to begin, am I right?<eos> We're going to get him back, okay?<eos> We got your wild card ready to go.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Me that should be thanking you.
The truth is, we never left.<eos> You're not holding the cards.<eos> - I am.<eos> - Are you?<eos> Every law agency in the world is looking for you.
Enjoy your freedom while you can.<eos> You look gorgeous, as always.<eos> You guys need to stop bringing him.<eos> Okay, I have something to show you guys.<eos> I may just push you in the pool. Uh-oh.
You guys need to stop bringing him.<eos> Okay, I have something to show you guys.<eos> I may just push you in the pool. Uh-oh.<eos> It's all the same people.<eos> She wants you so bad.
- I'm gonna go.<eos> - Okay.<eos> God.<eos> Hey, we need to talk.<eos> Oh, my God, I'm so happy to see you.
Dr. Gregory called me yesterday.<eos> You were supposed to see him.<eos> And your guidance counselor is concerned, too.<eos> Are you at least taking your medication?<eos> I told you, I don't like the medication they put me on.
Oh, thank you.<eos> I'll tell you a secret.<eos> I always wanted a little sister.<eos> So maybe... you and I can just hang out, us girls.<eos> Hey, why don't I walk you out?
I need to see Tyler Hansen.<eos> Tyler Hansen, come with me.<eos> And bring your things.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I'm gonna have to ask you to clear out your locker and leave the school immediately.
The cauldron will stay in line, Provided you keep the vampires out.<eos> So why am I hearing about secret conclaves, Sigils scribbled on the walls?<eos> Sounds like someone's stirring up trouble.<eos> Marcel, these out-of-town vampires got you a little bit paranoid, man.<eos> All right, look, I'm asking you, especially this week, handle your community.
Ah, well, heavy head, heavy crown, et cetera, et cetera.<eos> If I kill Alistair, his theory gains traction.<eos> The vampires turn against me.<eos> They storm the city.<eos> And if they find you, all they need is a drop of your blood, and then their witches can track your family.
And considering that I saved your ass, You should show me some respect.<eos> How do I know you weren't the one that led them to me?<eos> Does it matter?<eos> They know who you are and they want you dead.<eos> The only way to survive is to do exactly what I tell you.
If you need me to say "please," Vincent, I will.<eos> What have you gotten yourself into, Marcel?<eos> - You about to start a war?<eos> - No. If this goes the way I expect, I won't have to lift a finger.<eos> All I need from you Is a boundary spell.
Congratulations.<eos> You handled that rather well.<eos> Alistair's a corpse.<eos> Klaus is a prisoner.<eos> And every vampire in this town either loves you or fears you.
Vincent. I never figured you for Marcel's lackey.<eos> I'm nobody's lackey, Klaus.<eos> As far as I'm concerned, this is justice.<eos> And will it be justice when I escape and come for you both?<eos> Oh, Klaus, we could have handed you over.
Let's go get him.<eos> Don't know when to stop, do you?<eos> Perhaps when I've buried you in a dungeon like this.<eos> Oh, you should just say thank you.<eos> After all, I could have thrown you to Alistair With this in your heart.
I see it.<eos> It's a kill switch.<eos> Come on, Clarke.<eos> The nuclear power plants that were destroyed by the bombs have begun to melt down.<eos> The Earth's surface will be uninhabitable, so, you see, the City of Light is the only thing that can save you.
Still, keep it to ourselves until we know what we're dealing with and how to stop it.<eos> Damn.<eos> You're afraid of how people will react.<eos> Yes.<eos> Besides, I could use a break from keeping you alive.
It's like A.L.I.E. upgraded your brain.<eos> You ok?<eos> Are you?<eos> You've been through more than anyone.<eos> There's nothing like a little pain to remind you you're alive.
It's not safe for my kind here.<eos> Are forbidden.<eos> I have to leave this place, John.<eos> So, what, you're gonna bail on me again? I didn't bail on you.<eos> I came back, took the damn chip because Jaha said he would take me to you.
Of course it wasn't.<eos> You were a bargaining chip.<eos> It almost broke your mother to send you away.<eos> Killing Lexa in soulou gonplei was to be your triumphant return, but you lost.<eos> Our war chiefs don't respect you.
The army is loyal to them, not you.<eos> And who are you loyal to...<eos> Spy?<eos> I'm loyal to my clan, to my king.<eos> Let me serve you.
Let me serve you.<eos> I can help you do what your mother never could, what Ontari never could.<eos> - Rule everything. - Yes.<eos> Trikru is weak and ready to fall, and Skaikru is more hated than ever.<eos> Give the order to take them both out, and our war chiefs will follow you.
I can help you do what your mother never could, what Ontari never could.<eos> - Rule everything. - Yes.<eos> Trikru is weak and ready to fall, and Skaikru is more hated than ever.<eos> Give the order to take them both out, and our war chiefs will follow you.<eos> Show them Wanheda's head while you do it, and they will worship you.
Oh, I'm betting there is.<eos> But what if you're wrong?<eos> If there's no oil, do we lose the ranch?<eos> Well, that's always a risk.<eos> Any time you find a decent piece of land, sure as sunup, someone out there's gonna try and take it from you.
If you're referring to that strung-up cattle rustler, now that you menti it, I might know something about that.<eos> Armando couldn't rustle up supper, let alone 70 head.<eos> He was confederating with the sediciosos, Pete.<eos> Armando cut the fence, and he looked the other way when them Mexers stole your property.<eos> I tell you, my friend, he admitted to all of it.
I'll take care of that.<eos> Howdy.<eos> Hey, boys.<eos> Hey, John, how are you?<eos> So nice to see you.
Here. Eat something.<eos> You know, I never knew a place like this could exist.<eos> You need to eat.<eos> I'll bet our tracks will be covered up by the wind.<eos> They're gonna kill you if you don't eat.
Bitch.<eos> Told you you'd lose.<eos> You owe me a carton of Camels.<eos> Oh, my God. Look at you.<eos> Your parents are gonna kill you.
- No, I didn't.<eos> - You absolutely did.<eos> - You probably did. - Hello!<eos> - Stop. No, I didn't.<eos> - Sorry we couldn't pick you up.
The doctor said you were defiant and a bad influence on the other girls.<eos> Is this what it's gonna be now?<eos> Are you proud of yourself?<eos> I'm maintaining.<eos> I have to weigh you.
- You wanna go back to your mother's?<eos> - Mom moved to Phoenix with Olive.<eos> Yeah, that's what I mean.<eos> Phoenix.<eos> We can put you on the bus, first thing tomorrow.
Dad and Susan are gonna kick me out, or drag me to that treatment.<eos> - Okay, so eat.<eos> - I eat.<eos> You know that I love you like a full sister, but you look like absolute crap.<eos> And every time I ask you why you do this, I always get some stupid non-answer from you.
How are you feeling right now, Pearl?<eos> It's okay.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Just... that it's hard getting better.<eos> And I'm guessing that you're worried about how you're gonna be burning it off, especially when everybody's here watching you?
Do you even hear what Judy is saying?<eos> A young women died.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> - Meet me in the car.<eos> I'm sorry, we just... We just can't take you with us right now.
Here you go.<eos> You're shaking like a chihuahua.<eos> I know what you're trying to do.<eos> Life's beautiful and all that... shit.<eos> And that upsets you because...?
And you're falling in love with me?<eos> Okay, I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't mean to unleash the Kraken.<eos> - I've known you for, like, three weeks.<eos> - Well, I've known you for two years.
I know I'm messed up... but you're supposed to teach me how not to be.<eos> You know how.<eos> Stop waiting for life to be easy.<eos> Stop hoping for somebody to save you.<eos> You don't need another person lying to you.
Do you remember her?<eos> - The pastor?<eos> - No, she wrote The Pure Way of Light.<eos> She's very interested in Olive's work and has been... a great comfort to me around your illness.<eos> And she... feels that it would be healing for the both of us if you allowed me to feed you.
Unshackle them.<eos> I want them deloused and excavating by the next shift.<eos> Give me four.<eos> Sir, this one's defective.<eos> Hey, we got you!
You almost went a whole session<eos> Well, you refuse to answer my questions.<eos> Maybe he will.<eos> Hey. Does the master even exist?<eos> I'll say this one last time, the master will see you when you're ready.
You don't talk much, do you?<eos> Here, we go.<eos> Here.<eos> Yeah, the quota is 40 pound a day.<eos> If you don't make it, these nice men will whip you.
All of our conversations?<eos> She wanted to know about your progress.<eos> It's my job.<eos> I'm your Abbot.<eos> I trusted you, Ava.
Is everybody here?<eos> Turns out, we had a picker who didn't make his quota.<eos> In fact, his haul weighed less than zero.<eos> I had no idea that we, uh, we had such a celebrated killer in our midst.<eos> I heard they called you something in the badlands?
Part of the job, kid.<eos> - Hey, new guy.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Other door.<eos> Oh, that's gonna cost you, bro.
Wow. That was amazing.<eos> You've gotten so good.<eos> You didn't even see me.<eos> Where's Mom?<eos> Uh, I-I thought I'd pick you up.
Whaddya talking about?<eos> I'll do the wills. - No, you won't. - 'Course I will.<eos> They're my clients.<eos> They're my clients.<eos> You and I aren't partners, remember? Once I take these people on, I can't just reassign them to you.
I love you.<eos> Make it a great day.<eos> I got the note.<eos> I got the note, Michael.<eos> We're going to get you out of here.
No, you're doped up on painkillers and you're thinking too much.<eos> I promise this has nothing to do with you.<eos> You rest.<eos> I'm going to, um...<eos> I'm gonna run some errands, and then I'm gonna come visit you, okay?
They're the doctors on this one, not you.<eos> And I'm going full mental in here, so I'm gonna go.<eos> Okay. How about this?<eos> When you are discharged, why don't we go up to your parents' lake house?<eos> I'll just pick you up with Mike and we'll go.
But even if it is just within these walls, the law of the land is still in place.<eos> The law of God supersedes the law of this corrupt land.<eos> We will not be reduced to animals.<eos> Amazing you still trust him.<eos> He will use you for the escape and he will leave you.
Nowhere is safe anymore.<eos> I need two passports. One for me, one for my brother, Michael Scofield.<eos> $1,000 U.S. each, deposit.<eos> $1,000 U.S. when you pick them up.<eos> You screw with me and I'll kill you.
We're telling him we're getting him out.<eos> There's a difference. We got to act like we're on his side until the moment we're not.<eos> But what if you're acting like you're on my side till the moment you're not?<eos> You are getting paranoid.<eos> Yeah, well, four years in the box is gonna do that to you.
There's a difference. We got to act like we're on his side until the moment we're not.<eos> But what if you're acting like you're on my side till the moment you're not?<eos> You are getting paranoid.<eos> Yeah, well, four years in the box is gonna do that to you.<eos> I'm not leaving you behind.
They're empty.<eos> Sheba!<eos> I'm sorry I hit you.<eos> - I can explain. - Can you explain why you were going to let that man kill me?<eos> I wouldn't have let him kill you.
- Son of a bitch Kaniel Outis keeps playing, doesn't he?<eos> Where is my watch?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Hmm. You don't?<eos> I'm going to break you in half when I find that watch, you know?
Yeah, all right.<eos> Who are these men you work with?<eos> They're beneath you.<eos> You're beneath me.<eos> It pains me to hurt you, but a good woman is a humble woman.
And it's the same with this one.<eos> You know, we trump you up as Kaniel Outis, big international terrorist.<eos> It's just a name, it's just a rap sheet, it's a way to get you locked up.<eos> Right?<eos> I guess what I'm asking you is did... did something happen to you while you were in solitary?
I trusted you, Kaniel Outis.<eos> And you lied to me.<eos> By God and my armies of the caliphate, you will die for it.<eos> Maybe even tomorrow.<eos> I'm putting you in danger by saying this, but maybe it doesn't matter because I'll be dead, and they'll leave you alone.
And now you're dead to her.<eos> You know that.<eos> Otherwise, you'd have hurt me by now.<eos> But you're not gonna.<eos> Because you know she would never forgive you for it.
Did Frank confess?<eos> Who told you that?<eos> Just tell me.<eos> Yes.<eos> Who told you?
I didn't even know.<eos> Which means he's lying.<eos> He's just trying to save Annalise, right?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'll call you back.
Didn't I see that detective in here this morning?<eos> Uh, I thought you were on an O.B. rotation.<eos> I am.<eos> So how come you were here this morning?<eos> I came to visit you.
Why she ain't turning around?<eos> 'Cause she rude.<eos> Hey, yo!<eos> Why you kill that boy?<eos> Hey, I'm talking to you!
Shut up and act normal.<eos> Did you find anything yet?<eos> Look at that.<eos> Either the D.A.'s office is out of options or they decided to send in the big guns.<eos> Nice to see you, too.
You wouldn't be in this mess if it weren't for my big mouth.<eos> I made you tell me.<eos> I should have broken up with you, Oli.<eos> A long time ago.<eos> I should have rejected you or made you hate me, but instead, I... just needed you.
And?<eos> They charged him as your co-conspirator.<eos> I thought that I could do this, Annalise.<eos> I really did.<eos> I thought... that this would get you out.
- Are you still following him?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You want me to do anything else?<eos> Just don't lose him.<eos> I'll call you soon.
I wanted the State Department, not you.<eos> Any chance Poseidon will just let us kill her?<eos> I've learned some things about who it is we're apparently both looking for.<eos> You think Michael's in Yemen?<eos> - We're gonna get you out of here.
I just can't believe this.<eos> I can't believe this.<eos> - Back at the prison.<eos> - Why? - Why did you say?<eos> - I had to deny you.
You hungry?<eos> I'll make you something.<eos> Be right back.<eos> Just finish that.<eos> I said I'd bring it to you.
You're in so much pain.<eos> Why are you putting yourself through all this?<eos> - 'Cause I wanted to tell you...<eos> - That you have regrets.<eos> And I'm telling you don't bother.
In the end, you're gonna hurt everyone around you.<eos> You can't help it.<eos> So stop apologizing and accept it.<eos> Embrace it.<eos> Frankly, I'd have more respect for you if you did.
Friday's tricky for me. I have dinner with the Faitelsons.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> I thought you were allergic to the Stepford wives.<eos> I mean, they're not my favorite people, but they're amusing, and it's convenient.<eos> You know what? If I was your therapist, I would tell you, you need to let go a little.
- No, I'm not.<eos> You don't think I know when you're drunk?<eos> You say it like I'm breaking the law.<eos> I'm of age, you know?<eos> You really want me to take you to the train station right now, like this?
Putting you through.<eos> Hey, honey.<eos> Fucking watch it!<eos> Oh, whoa, wait a second.<eos> Oh, honey, listen, I don't want to keep nagging you, but I really want to know that you booked the tickets and the flights before they get crazy.
No, but he does.<eos> Burned it up jacking off to Queen, though.<eos> Guilty as charged.<eos> C-Note's organizing a passage on the flight as we speak.<eos> No, I'm telling you, my plan will work.
The border is hundreds.<eos> Look, the airport might be the right choice, but I trust my instincts.<eos> They've gotten us this far.<eos> And my gut says we can still make it out through the north. Choice is yours.<eos> Look, man, I agree with you, even if I don't know you from Adam. But... got to go with the horse that got you here, you know?
Not you.<eos> What are you gonna do with that?<eos> Michael, come on.<eos> I'm sorry, Linc.<eos> I should have come to you.
You need to share the burden.<eos> Yes. That's family.<eos> That's what family's for.<eos> Sara, I don't know what you thought, but... I'm just a husband who was worried about his wife.<eos> And yeah, I-I should have told you what I was doing, but... Look, I felt like... like everything was spiraling out of control and I had to do whatever I could to protect you.
We're gonna get you out of here.
Team Eye in the Sky for ten years.<eos> Watched the most heinous crap you can imagine by satellite.<eos> Stonings, rapes.<eos> Just had to sit back and watch it like a horror film, helpless, until Poseidon tapped my shoulder, gave me a chance to do something about it.<eos> Emily, good to see you again.
Get this off of me.<eos> Hold your hand still.<eos> Just do it already.<eos> Do you want to stay like this?<eos> You're lucky we cut you loose.
We're leaving him a beautiful set of tire tracks to follow.<eos> Who the hell is this guy?<eos> It's the guy who killed Sid.<eos> Son of a bitch is like a dog with a bone?<eos> You kill someone's spiritual leader, they'll follow you to the ends of the Earth, apparently.
Linc.<eos> No.<eos> You knew the rules, Linc.<eos> He's picking up again.<eos> I'm not leaving you out here to die.
I'm not leaving you out here to die.<eos> I have no intention of dying.<eos> Anyway, you've got the harder job.<eos> You've got to find Phaeacia out there somewhere.<eos> Leave tracks so I know how to find you.
Michael's b negative, okay?<eos> It's maybe one percent of the population with that blood type.<eos> You won't find it where you're going, and he won't make it while you look.<eos> Unless it comes to you.<eos> I'll call you back.
- Previously on Prison Break...<eos> - We're gonna get you out of here.
Or are you gonna get me a partner, so we get on with the business of changing the world?<eos> Done.<eos> _<eos> I need some food.<eos> I'm with you.
All they had to see were DEA hats and SUVs, and they were gone.<eos> Famous Michael Scofield.<eos> Sheba.<eos> Thank you for everything.<eos> You have no idea how happy I am to see you back home.
We don't do anything.<eos> Your part is over.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no. Tricking Abruzzi's kid is one thing.<eos> Poseidon... he knows your face.<eos> Been tracking you since you went to Yemen.
You've been a warrior, and I owe you.<eos> But your face is a liability now to you and your family.<eos> I don't want you to risk that.<eos> They may know his face, but they don't know mine.<eos> It's the punch you don't see coming that knocks you out.
For what?<eos> Prize money?<eos> That's really worth it to you?<eos> Look, without that money, my sister, Karma, spends the rest of her days in an insane asylum.<eos> So, no matter how good you are in the sack or how pretty your forearms are, I will throw you in that engine if you get in my way.
"Patient already had markings on her arms where some form of needle has been used."<eos> There's a load of shit here, man.<eos> Christopher, I got to go.<eos> Get the hell out of there, man.<eos> I'll talk to you soon, buddy.
Let me take care of you.<eos> However, you did attempt to contact your former partner, did you not?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> That was just...<eos> Which means, before I can trust you, we need to perform some slight behavioral modification.
That is not your kid!<eos> Not anymore!<eos> When you gonna open this door?<eos> We can't open that door again.<eos> Those people will kill you.
At this rate, that thing's gonna get to the reactor before we can seal everything off.<eos> In that case...<eos> Hey, Doc, grab a torch and come down here and help me.<eos> I don't know how to use one.<eos> Well, get your ass down here and I'll show you how.
There has to be something.<eos> I just can't see it yet.<eos> - Just stop for a second.<eos> - Not yet.<eos> I need to talk to you.
Revenge is the last thing I'm thinking about now.<eos> We're not right.<eos> - We are.<eos> - We're not.<eos> So unless you can see how to get you out safe, and get that thing off our ship, don't talk to me.
If this plan doesn't work...<eos> I'll blow the hatch.<eos> There's no way this ends with that thing inside this ship.<eos> Thank you.<eos> In case I have to kill you, I just wanted to say thanks.
Boys.<eos> Can we have the room for a minute?<eos> - Sure.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Glad I didn't have to kill you, brother.
Glad I didn't have to kill you, brother.<eos> Me too.<eos> God.<eos> I spend a lot more time in this room than I'd like.<eos> I have something I need to say to you.
This is Jean Holloway.<eos> I was expecting you at 3:00 p.m.<eos> If you can call the office, please, at 212-555-0168, and we can discuss.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I didn't know if I'd ever see you again.
Look, I know that head of yours is full of questions.<eos> So, go ahead.<eos> Don't be shy.<eos> Why did you fake your death and pretend to be Michael Wayland?<eos> To protect you from my enemies.
Clary! - Thank God I found you.<eos> - Let me guess.<eos> Luke called you.<eos> And what are you even doing here?<eos> You're not supposed to leave either. I went to Aldertree and asked him to let me bring you back.
Every institute is powered by an angelic power core.<eos> Alec's not picking up. Let's move.<eos> Valentine is gonna wish he never laid a hand on Simon.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa! You're not going anywhere near that institute.<eos> We're taking you to Magnus. He can protect you.
- Clarissa, please.<eos> Clary, you all right? I'm fine.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Jace, what are you doing?<eos> If you touch the Sword, it'll kill you.
I sped out just in time.<eos> I've come to gather what's left of my clan And see if you needed anything.<eos> No.<eos> - Isabelle, please. I can explain... - No, you can't.<eos> I don't want anything from you ever again.
Better now that you're okay and Valentine's locked up.<eos> Oh, no. Luke, are you okay?<eos> He's been sedated.<eos> Clary...<eos> I know it's not a good time, but there's something I have to show you.
I'm gonna work with Magnus.<eos> Alec, stop!<eos> Stop!<eos> What's your problem?<eos> Sebastian Verlac shows up out of the blue and saves you?
If you want to create a portal, let's get a real one.<eos> So you can use 'em to switch you back and escape this mess?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> And once I give you the Cup?<eos> I'll reward your kindness by delivering you into a body that you deserve.
It's just, uh...<eos> You've never refused to help me when I need it, and I just Magnus.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Hey... talk to me.<eos> Did I not tell you to get rid of him?
And no one is kidnapping anyone, OK?<eos> Relax.<eos> Who are you again?<eos> I am Raphael's friend, Isabelle.<eos> We came to visit you last week for Bingo night.
Please!<eos> Please, they're torturing me!<eos> I can't take any more of this.<eos> I know the feeling.<eos> Let's get you out of here.
After your capture, the Clave hired me to create wards to block Downworlder powers from being used in this cellblock.<eos> Not only can't you break me out, but your cloaking spell won't work here.<eos> We'll see about that.<eos> What the hell?<eos> They can see you.
That, and finding out he's not really Valentine's son.<eos> Wait, that means that means Jace isn't Clary's brother.<eos> Simon, I...<eos> I thought you knew.<eos> It would have been a lot easier to wait 'til nightfall to kill you.
Feeling a little weak from withdrawal?<eos> I can fix that if you like...<eos> Any last words?<eos> You're lucky your sister doesn't know who you are.<eos> Cause if she did, she'd hate you.
Feel it!<eos> You try to stall... with a flick of my finger, Jace dies.<eos> Your mother is never coming back.<eos> Your father will never love you.<eos> The only reason he wanted you was to use you.
You're a catch.<eos> Look, I...<eos> I'm sorry if I was too hard on you tonight.<eos> I... I hope you know I never wanted to do anything<eos> - to purposefully hurt you...
I was thinking maybe, um, maybe the reason you didn't tell me is 'cause you guys used to have a thing.<eos> - So now that he's not your brother...<eos> - No!<eos> Oh, Simon.<eos> The reason I didn't tell you is I...
Céline was beautiful.<eos> Golden hair like yours.<eos> She was so smart, so headstrong.<eos> You definitely got your stubbornness from her.<eos> If they could see you now, Jace... they would be so proud of you.
You shouldn't be out alone.<eos> Raphael, thank you for coming.<eos> Just so you know, Simon and I would have never hurt your sister.<eos> I didn't come here for apologies.<eos> I came to reason with you.
And I'm not even ready to perform in front of two or three people yet.<eos> Unless they're really drunk.<eos> -Simon, have I ever lied to you?<eos> -Not that I know of.<eos> Then believe me when I tell you... you are going to crush it.
He was a hero.<eos> Leonard.<eos> I must be losing my mind.<eos> You're not riding ahead, Mick.<eos> That's why I'm here... To set you straight.
Until you weren't.<eos> I hate when he does that.<eos> If you have something to say to me, Malcolm, I suggest you keep it to yourself.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Am I supposed to be afraid of you?
If you have something to say to me, Malcolm, I suggest you keep it to yourself.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Am I supposed to be afraid of you?<eos> Oh, I would be.<eos> Considering I can kill you before you even knew I was doing it.
Just my colleague merely frequents this establishment at this hour.<eos> Sorry, Jefferson.<eos> You should go back to the Waverider.<eos> I can handle things from here.<eos> What the hell is going on with you, man?
Sloppy, Damien.<eos> No wonder they passed you over for Ra's...<eos> You see, this is where he reminds me that he was Ra's al Ghul.<eos> Poor Malcolm. Always living in the past.<eos> This is when I remind you about your future.
Ah, well, the good news is you two finally got what you wanted, you managed to balance our partnership.<eos> We're now all equally dead.<eos> Oh, I wouldn't worry about that.<eos> This isn't the first scary speedster that we had to put in his place.<eos> We're gonna get you out of this bank vault, Eobard.
That you stop running.<eos> It knows I'm here.<eos> Good.<eos> Because we've only got one shot at this.<eos> Remember, as long as you stay still, he can't sense you.
But if there's one thing my travels aboard the Waverider have taught me, it's that time often doesn't provide us with what we want.<eos> But it... it's quite adept at giving us what we need.<eos> And I... I nel ed you... in my life... In ways that I...<eos> I just don't want there to be any more secrets between us.<eos> Well, in that spirit, I suppose I should tell you that I am one half of a nuclear powered superhero called Firestorm.
(both chuckle) Not to mention they've handed us the perfect opportunity.<eos> For what?<eos> The city is in total disarray.<eos> What better time to consolidate power?<eos> Barbara, I've told you again and again, I have no interest in running Gotham.
Not like this.<eos> Well... (cork squeaks) ...this is the only way, Jim.<eos> Just listen to the whispers.<eos> (ears ringing, heart beating) GORDON (whispers):<eos> They'll lead you to me, tell you who you are.
- GORDON:<eos> GCPD! - Don't move!<eos> What a surprise.<eos> MOONEY: My goodness, Harvey, you look awful.<eos> It's good to see you, too.
It's in his eyes.<eos> He has the virus. (chuckles)<eos> Really?<eos> So tell me, James, what's it feel like?<eos> Like it's taking all my willpower... not to kill you.
Both of them.<eos> (ice crackling) Marvelous.<eos> Just marvelous.<eos> There he is, - the real James Gordon.<eos> Nice to meet you, at last.
Alvarez, spread the word, Mayor James has called in the National Guard.<eos> We don't want any soldiers getting shot by mistake.<eos> Leave me alone.<eos> The hell's wrong with you?<eos> Alvarez, I'm talking to you.
What the hell is she doing here?<eos> BARTENDER: One whiskey.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Well, this is a strange day.<eos> Never thought I'd see you in here.
- Right. Out.<eos> You've got the virus.<eos> Wow, you're not as dumb as I've heard.<eos> Are there any other glaringly obvious remarks you'd like to make?<eos> How about I cut your lungs out and show them to you?
And now Barbara's partners with him?<eos> That's the mother of all insults. The city is gonna pay us a lot of money to get Tetch back.<eos> We need to let that play out before we do anything rash.<eos> I know you two are close.<eos> But whatever you had, she treats you like dirt now.
GILZEAN:<eos> Regroup? For what?<eos> ! For whatever the hell I tell you to do!<eos> (door opens, closes) I'm not waiting anymore.<eos> She's broken every promise she's ever made to you...
But, unlike you, I am in the position to rectify my mistake.<eos> Prepare for one massive tantrum.<eos> That is not possible!<eos> It is my turn!<eos> It is my turn to kill you!
Well, believe me, if it weren't for Tabby, - you'd have been dead a long time ago. - (chuckles)<eos> You're trying to tell me she had nothing to do with this?<eos> - That's right.<eos> - Oh, so you've just gone behind her back, have you?<eos> I was gonna hit you before we got to the safe house.
(crying): Alfred, please.<eos> Please don't leave me.<eos> Here we are.<eos> Again.<eos> I have to tell you, this feels really great.
Any last words?<eos> I'm fine for now.<eos> I beg your pardon?<eos> I'll wait.<eos> I'm going to kill you, Oswald.
But if having the virus allowed Gotham to embrace its worst self, the cure should remind us there is always hope.<eos> A chance to remember who we can be rather than who we are.<eos> I don't know if Gotham deserves saving, but I do know one thing.<eos> If anyone can save it... it's you.<eos> And in return, I believe it can save you as well.
A chance to remember who we can be rather than who we are.<eos> I don't know if Gotham deserves saving, but I do know one thing.<eos> If anyone can save it... it's you.<eos> And in return, I believe it can save you as well.<eos> And then maybe one day, it will send you back to me.
I wanna help you.<eos> - Really?<eos> - You don't have much time... before the paradox reaches you.<eos> Come back to S.T.A.R Labs.<eos> Let Cisco and Caitlin go, and let us figure out a way to save you.
You really think I'd trust you?<eos> You showed up.<eos> So you remember me coming here.<eos> Did I have any tricks up my sleeve?<eos> Was I... was I planning on blindsiding you?
I can't do this.<eos> No, yes, you can.<eos> Okay?<eos> I will be here for you.<eos> I tried to kill you.
He was my hero.<eos> Mine too.<eos> Good on you, mate.<eos> Thanks for believing in me, H.R.<eos> Hey, I've been looking for the right time to tell you.
- I'll do my best.<eos> They're all gonna look to you now.<eos> I'm not a hero like you.<eos> You've always been my hero.<eos> All this time we were trying to save Iris, you're telling me that... we should've been trying to save you too?
-The party that we're gonna throw for Laurel tomorrow night.<eos> That sounds great.<eos> I mean, i--i would love to see everyone--<eos> Oh, my--John! Ohh!<eos> I came here to tell you, and I totally forgot.
The fact that you killed his dad.<eos> Felicity and Lyla are working on<eos> What happened with the dude who<eos> Well, she... Doesn't stay in one spot for very long, but, uh, I'm working on finding her.<eos> In the meantime, we need to work on a way of getting you out of here. Yeah.
of the man that-- that I loved.<eos> So stop running.<eos> Face the darkness.<eos> How does that work?<eos> First, you need to tell me everything that you know about prometheus, everything, and then we keep you safe.
I mean, ever since the party, you been off.<eos> You're supposed to be the happy one, remember?<eos> Like what? !<eos> Like this?<eos> What the hell's gotten into you?
And what do you think?<eos> I think...<eos> You should get used to living in cages.<eos> There's a part of him that blames himself<eos> It's who he is, so when he looks at you...
No.<eos> We're gonna get justice for Billy.<eos> But first, we need to take care of your ex, who's not even your ex.<eos> There's a part of him that blames himself for Laurel's death.<eos> It's who he is, so when he looks at you, he sees more than just Laurel.
You know me better<eos> I failed Laurel before.<eos> I can't...<eos> I can't fail her again.<eos> I don't have to remind you that this isn't her.
-This should do it. -Are you sure?<eos> No, but we're out of time.<eos> Prometheus.<eos> Diazepam.<eos> That should slow you down.
After 3 years, the man who killed my partner is finally in my sights.<eos> I'm not letting anyone get in my way.<eos> Lady wants to commit suicide, we should let her.<eos> Free country.<eos> He nearly killed you last time.
With it, you can take down politicians, bankrupt companies, spark revolutions.<eos> So you're not just giving me the file for John.<eos> You inspired me to make the world a better place, and now I intend to inspire you to be the hacktivist you used to be, the great ghost fox Goddess.<eos> Let me guess.<eos> You're trusting me with your mask off, so now I'm supposed to trust you.
I thought I would feel liberated.<eos> I wish it worked that way.<eos> How do you do it?<eos> How do you keep living with so much pain?<eos> I'm still working on that myself, but I can tell you it helps to not be alone.
Right my wrongs.<eos> Survive.<eos> No!<eos> You used your father's memory to justify a killing spree.<eos> I am not going to kill you.
I trust him more than you.<eos> Didn't he kill your mother?<eos> You listen to me very carefully.<eos> You help me take down Chase, you walk.<eos> You screw with me even a little bit, and I will put you right back into that hole.
Malcolm, can you fly a plane?<eos> If it's anything like the 3 Gulfstreams I used to have, yes.<eos> Get them to the mainland and then come right back for us.<eos> We are not leaving you here.<eos> I need to focus, and that means getting you out of harm's way, and despite my better instincts, when this is all over, I will come back for you.
Get them to the mainland and then come right back for us.<eos> We are not leaving you here.<eos> I need to focus, and that means getting you out of harm's way, and despite my better instincts, when this is all over, I will come back for you.<eos> When this is all over, you'll be dead.<eos> Can I talk to you for a sec?
I know.<eos> It's just-- it was complicated, you know?<eos> I saw that kiss you gave him.<eos> Doesn't seem that complicated to me.<eos> You know, I traveled halfway across the world to rescue you.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.<eos> Well, you don't seem too bright.<eos> Just standing out here in the open like this.<eos> What kind of ass-backwards strategy is that?<eos> Let me show you.
Oliver.<eos> Don't blame me.<eos> Mr. Wilson's the one who gets credit for this trophy.<eos> Slade, you son of a bitch.<eos> I never should have trusted you.
You're going to.<eos> Do svidaniya, Konstantin.<eos> My men overheard your conversation with that traitor Knyazev.<eos> The boat he's arranging will be here soon.<eos> I don't have to kill you, Oliver Queen.
Oliver, are you ok?<eos> It's ok.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> John, you need to get to the plane and make sure that everyone's safe.<eos> Felicity can talk you in.
Upstairs, please.<eos> Start your homework.<eos> I'll be right up, honey.<eos> Hi, Jean.<eos> I have been trying to get a hold of you.
- Definitely affair.<eos> - Hmm. Too much passion for a first date.<eos> Do you think I'd know if you were having an affair?<eos> Well, I would never.<eos> I can't keep anything from you, so I think you're safe.
I got a call to pick you up and bring you to the scene.<eos> My boy.<eos> In memory of your son, and on behalf of a grateful city and the Los Angeles Police Department.<eos> You... killed him.<eos> I can't stand to look at you.
Bosch, Bosch, Bosch.<eos> Look at you.<eos> Most guys would've pulled the pin, take the pension, lean back, enjoy life.<eos> Except you got none.<eos> When the department finally puts you out to pasture, you'll eat your gun.
I'm sure you are.<eos> It wrecked him, this damn war.<eos> He had no end of troubles when he finally came home.<eos> Now this.<eos> I'll tell you what isn't here:
It was delish.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I have homework.<eos> Okay.<eos> It's good to see you, Maddie.
When Maddie finishes school.<eos> You know what?<eos> Fuck this.<eos> This is me, Grace, asking.<eos> What the fuck is eating you, Harry?
Didn't wanna scare you.<eos> Too late.<eos> What are you... doin' down here... alone?<eos> You know, uh...<eos> Moms say there's no way a jury's gonna convict you on circumstantial evidence.
- Mm-hmm.<eos> - You've never met her? - No.<eos> Uh-uh.<eos> Isabella, this is Gabe.<eos> she looks like you.
Well, you haven't really been talking to me, have you?<eos> Can you stop playing games and just tell me?<eos> Okay, I'm not the one playing games.<eos> Look... I know you had an abortion.<eos> And that you didn't give Jesus a chance to tell you what he really wanted, which was to be a dad, by the way.
And if you testify against him, we can put him away for life.<eos> I'm scared.<eos> I know you are, honey, I know you are, but listen to me, look at me.<eos> We can give you a whole new name and a whole new life that he knows nothing about.<eos> So he can never, ever find you, and he will never... hurt you again.
- What did she tell you?<eos> - Well, some people might be trying to make Anchor Beach a private school.<eos> I don't know if it's true, but nobody knows, so just don't spread it around, okay?<eos> Yeah. Okay.<eos> Jesus, can I talk to you for a sec?
- And... and sex isn't... everything.<eos> - That's easy for you to say.<eos> Okay, but... you can talk to your doctor.<eos> Right?<eos> He can put you on something else
You have your whole life ahead of you.<eos> And me?<eos> I'm already dead.<eos> Don't come back here.<eos> I won't agree to see you again.
Excuse me. Hey, Gray?<eos> Detective.<eos> You know Doug Harvey?<eos> You came to my house.<eos> Can I talk to you for a minute?
- You know, I'm better than I've been in a long while, thanks.<eos> That's fantastic to hear, but look, maybe we shouldn't-- not press my luck by sitting down with your new girlfriend?<eos> Well, no.<eos> Just--just wait a little bit.<eos> Let Thea come back and prep you and--
- Oliver, we don't have time!<eos> We have to get Walker now, right now!<eos> Let me in there, and I'll give him all the persuasion he needs.<eos> He's gonna crack.<eos> If you push him too hard right now, he'll tell you whatever you want to hear to get the pain to stop!
Is--is this mood because you got pulled back into some Bratva drama?<eos> No, it...<eos> Dinah, I'm trying to move forward, but I'm back here, I'm in Russia, in the Bratva, and it just proves to me I can't seem to do that.<eos> Prometheus got in your head.<eos> What was it, some crap about infecting the people closest to you?
Can I come in, or is it still no dogs allowed?<eos> Pfft. You really got a wiseass mouth on you, don't you?<eos> I'm not sure, but did you just say my mouth looks like ass?<eos> Look.<eos> I just came here to tell you that Susan Williams' producer called to confirm that 10 a.m. tomorrow still works for the interview.
When I answered the phone, I guess.<eos> It was out of line bringing up my daughter.<eos> You gonna tell that to Susan Williams at 10 a.m. tomorrow?<eos> Look, man. You expecting me to give you an apology, you don't know me that well.<eos> I don't know you at all, but my sponsor says that I'm the one that owes you the apology.
I know.<eos> Bratva get tattoos on their chest when they make captain.<eos> - What about the other thing?<eos> The Russians call him luchnik, the Archer.<eos> Does he remind you of anyone you know?
Thank you.<eos> Curtis is coming in.<eos> He's gonna help with the search.<eos> It's really nice to have you back.<eos> Well, I could say the same to you.
My point is it's illegal for someone such as yourself to carry a firearm.<eos> But it's pretty easy to buy one, though.<eos> Am I using again?<eos> How could you even ask me something like that?<eos> Actually, I've been working up the nerve to ask you for a while now!
- What was that for?<eos> - That was "I'm sorry."<eos> For canceling dinner on me last night.<eos> And the previous two times that I also canceled dinner, yes.<eos> Does this mean I'll get to see you tonight?
No. Heh.<eos> No. I'm sorry. I thought that you were doing a joking thing.<eos> I... so I did a joking thing back.<eos> Are you not?<eos> I was working on a different story, and, well, some things came up that relate to you.
Susan asked me if I was the Green Arrow?<eos> Wait. What did you say to her?<eos> I handled it. I...<eos> I've been doing this for a little while now.<eos> Can I talk to you for a minute, please?
I didn't have anything to do with this,<eos> I don't know anything about this.<eos> And you're going to stand here and tell me that you're not the Green Arrow.<eos> - I already...<eos> - Because that tattoo on your chest marks you as a Bratva captain.
Are you ready?<eos> Konechno.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I surrender and he lets you live.<eos> He will kill you.
I would've told you that she was going to out you as the...<eos> Green Arrow.<eos> She wouldn't do that to me.<eos> And then you would say that.<eos> Look, Ollie, the only reason I didn't tell you was because I was trying to keep your hands clean.
Oak Hill Memorial.<eos> At least if we get shot, we don't have to go far.<eos> That is really not an encouraging perspective, Rene.<eos> Just a quick note.<eos> Listen, um, now that you're a freshly minted officer of the SCPD, we can't have you going out into the field and having your new coworkers recognize you.
Ok.<eos> You need to make things right with Susan.<eos> Ollie...<eos> You got her fired under false pretenses, Thea.<eos> Only because I was trying to protect you, which is what I am doing now.
Hey..<eos> This is so completely unfair.<eos> Yeah. That seems to be going around lately.<eos> So you got Oliver's girlfriend fired?<eos> He told you?
This is so completely unfair.<eos> Yeah. That seems to be going around lately.<eos> So you got Oliver's girlfriend fired?<eos> He told you?<eos> Of course he told you.
- What do you mean?<eos> - This week, it was Oliver's girlfriend.<eos> Last month, he tells me you're getting involved in some stuff - you shouldn't be involved in.<eos> - Well, that is a matter of perspective, considering that that "stuff"<eos> helped get you out of prison and General Walker's gun sights.
Challenge accepted.<eos> Hey, seriously, man, what's up with your balls?<eos> I mean, you were literally gonna throw those things in the trash.<eos> Paul called, asked me to dinner, like a date, like I'm gonna get my man back.<eos> I told you, Hoss, some piece of tech ain't gonna...
I'll put in a word with Mayor Queen.<eos> He's not impeached yet.<eos> Please tell me you didn't send it.<eos> This thing with Kullens' wife, he doesn't deserve that.<eos> Felicity told you, didn't she?
Thank you.<eos> I'm sorry. Sorry.<eos> We were stopping an assassination.<eos> Can you believe I stopped an assassination?<eos> So, um, on the way over here, I rehearsed what I would say to you...
I'm sorry. Sorry.<eos> We were stopping an assassination.<eos> Can you believe I stopped an assassination?<eos> So, um, on the way over here, I rehearsed what I would say to you...<eos> Heh... how I would win you back, tell you I love you, and all I just started with was definitely not how I planned on opening.
Heh... how I would win you back, tell you I love you, and all I just started with was definitely not how I planned on opening.<eos> Can I start again?<eos> I'm gonna start again.<eos> - When I came over...<eos> - It's nice to see you, Curtis.
I don't see any other monasteries on this mountain.<eos> Felicity's note said something about a demon... oh, wait, maybe that says, "lemon."<eos> Anyway, I... I texted her, but she has not hit me back.<eos> It says, "demon."<eos> Oliver, I'm losing you!
Well, Talia, it was difficult to find.<eos> Our business together concluded 5 years ago.<eos> No.<eos> One of your former students is trying to kill me.<eos> Oh, he doesn't want to kill you, Oliver.
Our business together concluded 5 years ago.<eos> No.<eos> One of your former students is trying to kill me.<eos> Oh, he doesn't want to kill you, Oliver.<eos> He means to destroy you utterly.
I got to tell you, I don't know how that mask is gonna play here, especially since the city's not too fond of your alter ego these days.<eos> I'll give them the Throwing Star Killer, see how they feel.<eos> That's your big plan, arresting me?<eos> Oh, man, that's a bit of a letdown, I have to say.<eos> Well, I'm not gonna kill you, if only because that's what you want me to do.
You got some nerve showing up here. Why wouldn't I?<eos> I take my job very seriously.<eos> Speaking of, I thought my office had requested your verifications on the latest ComStat reports from the SCPD.<eos> What you been doing?<eos> I'm gonna kill you in ways that will hurt.
- Yeah.<eos> A-Adrian Chase is...<eos> - I know!<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I'm gonna get you out of here.
Yeah.<eos> Just waiting on that rescue.<eos> Good.<eos> Step back!<eos> I'm glad Talia told you.
John!<eos> I've got an ambulance en route to your position.<eos> Oliver's in there with Chase.<eos> Go help him now!<eos> I told you, Oliver.
I've got an ambulance en route to your position.<eos> Oliver's in there with Chase.<eos> Go help him now!<eos> I told you, Oliver.<eos> I'm not gonna kill you, and you can't kill me.
They're the ones that found Susan.<eos> Gregor!<eos> Oliver, is that you?<eos> No.<eos> It's the man who's gonna kill you.
Just make sure he suffers.<eos> That was always the plan.<eos> My friends will find me.<eos> They're my strength.<eos> That's sweet, but I'm running out of ways to tell you, Oliver.
Now, where were we?<eos> 145, 144, 143, 142...<eos> Bandages and water will not help me.<eos> Before you die, tell us what you meant.<eos> You said if we kill you, we kill ourselves.
'Cause you haven't really looked.<eos> But for me, we both know it's just a matter of time.<eos> Confess.<eos> I don't know what you want me to say.<eos> Then I guess I should leave you here to think about it and wonder who I might kill while I'm gone.
I knew he'd break...<eos> Just like you said he would.<eos> It's 'cause I know him better than he even knows himself.<eos> Give us a moment alone, would you?<eos> I told you, Oliver.
You used your father's memory to justify a killing spree.<eos> There's a price to be paid for that, Oliver.<eos> Your mother paid it.<eos> Your friend Tommy paid it, Laurel.<eos> Do you really want to tell me that John Diggle and Felicity Smoak's lives are better having known you?
And I'm a man of my word.<eos> But first I have a gift for you.<eos> This tattoo of yours.<eos> To be an American and named a captain in the Bratva, you must have done something extraordinary.<eos> When you look at it, it must--it must remind you of such a victory.
Chase had me--<eos> And he let me go.<eos> Go slow, man.<eos> It's over.<eos> Oliver, we're gonna get this son of a bitch for whatever he did to you.
No place good.<eos> Well, the city council bought my story about your, spiritual retreat.<eos> And it turns out councilwoman Pollard is a big fan of all that stuff.<eos> You know, the woo-woo zen stuff.<eos> Look, I'm not asking what he did to you, all right?
If we can produce video that Chase is Prometheus, that's game over for him.<eos> Let's get started.<eos> Hey.<eos> They told me you were back.<eos> I had to see you.
It was him.<eos> Well, I...<eos> I created him.<eos> And I know that that might sound weird, but, this happened to you because of me.<eos> Don't let him do this to you.
So you got Anatoly to kill Chase so we wouldn't have to.<eos> I created Prometheus, John.<eos> I created this whole thing.<eos> Chase's death should be on my conscience, not yours.<eos> What the hell did Chase do to you, man, to convince you to think that any of this is ok?
And I'm not gonna let you make it.<eos> Well, I'm not gonna let you get hurt.<eos> And so here we are.<eos> Felicity was right.<eos> Prometheus trying to convince you that you are responsible for everything bad that's happened to people, Oliver, I swear that's just a bunch of crap.
This is a truth that I was keeping myself from seeing, and I am no longer doing that.<eos> Anatoly and his men will kill Adrian Chase.<eos> That is the solution.<eos> The team is done.<eos> So I'm telling you.
I guess you could say that I hacked the hackers. Whoa.<eos> What?<eos> The pixilation algorithm is encrypted.<eos> I should've known it would be encrypted, but it's encrypted.<eos> Well, how long will it take you to break the encryption?
My situation?<eos> Curtis might have told me about your wife and your daughter.<eos> Curtis talks too much.<eos> I don't disagree...<eos> But while he was talking, he also mentioned that he offered to set you up with a lawyer to help get your daughter back, and that was over two months ago.
- Don't.<eos> - Right.<eos> Oh, just sit down.<eos> Are you firing me?<eos> Oh, Rene, there was a time when I would have loved to hear you ask me that, but, no, I am not firing you.
- Right.<eos> Oh, just sit down.<eos> Are you firing me?<eos> Oh, Rene, there was a time when I would have loved to hear you ask me that, but, no, I am not firing you.<eos> I want to talk to you about...
- Can you blame me?<eos> - No.<eos> I--more than probably anyone else-- understand what it's like to be willing to do whatever it takes to stop Chase.<eos> Then let me do it.<eos> Let me just tell you how I'm seeing things.
No.<eos> That's not gonna work this time, Oliver.<eos> We both know that.<eos> Look. This is our only chance.<eos> And this is me asking you...
You know I can't do that.<eos> I was really hoping you wouldn't!<eos> Oliver, don't move.<eos> That is a 30-kilowatt spectral beam laser.<eos> It will cut you to the bone.
I was really hoping you wouldn't!<eos> Oliver, don't move.<eos> That is a 30-kilowatt spectral beam laser.<eos> It will cut you to the bone.<eos> Curtis will let you out.
I will go up the elevator shaft.<eos> Seriously, are you still not listening to me?<eos> Did the EMP give you short-term amnesia about what we were arguing about down here in the first place?<eos> This feels like the best choice right now.<eos> Besides the one I just gave you.
Do you remember what we were discussing before we got EMP-blasted?<eos> The fact that I back your play even when I don't agree, but you don't have the same consideration for me.<eos> You didn't listen to me when I wanted to join Helix.<eos> With good reason.<eos> I could say the same thing about you a million times over, but I support you because I trust you.
I'm not gonna say that Oliver Queen plays great with others.<eos> - But? - But he can still change that about himself.<eos> - Tch. - You know what he can't change?<eos> What?<eos> That way he looks at you.
Rene, stop!<eos> Agh!<eos> Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow! Ow!<eos> Ow! I'm gonna need you to stop making that noise.<eos> I'm sorry my agonizing pain is bothering you.
I did what I did...<eos> Because there was a part of me... a bigger part than I would like to admit...<eos> I enjoyed it.<eos> I enjoyed killing.<eos> It's not about not trusting you.
Because there was a part of me... a bigger part than I would like to admit...<eos> I enjoyed it.<eos> I enjoyed killing.<eos> It's not about not trusting you.<eos> I will always trust you.
Thanks for letting us come here. See?<eos> Argus isn't always used for evil.<eos> I know.<eos> You were right.<eos> I should have trusted you. I...
Nerdapalooza.<eos> Oliver just got out of surgery.<eos> He's going to be fine.<eos> - Can we see him.<eos> - Actually, he asked to see you.
The phrase "hot mess" comes to mind.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm figuring it out.<eos> Well, I'm glad.<eos> It's good to see you.
Oliver, I--<eos> Thea, wh--what are you doing here?<eos> It's nice to see you, too.<eos> No, sorry.<eos> It's-- it's great to see you.
I just weathered a scandal.<eos> I need to get out in front of this one.<eos> Ok, well, I think you should reconsider doing this whole press conference.<eos> Why?<eos> Because this could be what Chase is manipulating you into just like he manipulated you into the impeachment by throwing Green Arrow under the bus.
Chase wanted everyone cleared out.<eos> It seems that way.<eos> It's a hell of a big building.<eos> If he's in there, we should get started.<eos> If Chase wanted you here for some reason, he could have been more specific about which floor.
That video.<eos> He wants you to save your home.<eos> I do not think kapiushon is what he had in mind.<eos> Putting on the hood is the only way I know how to save my city.<eos> Now, I've told you, Oliver, hood is just piece of cloth.
Ten will get you 20, that's exactly what this is.<eos> One thing at a time.<eos> - Go!<eos> - Hey, Thea called.<eos> She says she needs to talk to you.
And they've got their super toxic gas with them.<eos> Copy.<eos> Tell Wild Dog to sit tight until we get there.<eos> Why'd he say I had to sit tight?<eos> - Because he knows you. - Oh.
He represented your father.<eos> I knew that already.<eos> You don't know what your father asked him to do.<eos> Adrian...<eos> He was going to disown you...
But at least I know he never would've given up on me.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Do it.<eos> No.<eos> I'm not gonna kill you, but I am gonna watch you face justice.
So first round's on me.<eos> I have something for you.<eos> Hmm. Oh, and here I thought you could never top the hozen.<eos> It's a video from dad.<eos> He made it before he died, and I should have given this to you sooner...
I don't know if it's a date.<eos> But you're hoping that it is?<eos> It's dinner. Ha ha!<eos> People go to dinner.<eos> See, I don't believe you, but I find it incredibly cute.
Pain is not a new experience to you.<eos> Then stop wasting my time.<eos> That was my epiphany.<eos> For true retribution, I couldn't merely cause you pain.<eos> I had to wake you up, open your eyes, make you see the pain you suffer is still with you.
So these kidnappings are what, payback?<eos> Before Chase tortured me,<eos> I told him that the team was my strength.<eos> He's trying to take it away.<eos> So his lady friends can come after you instead of him?
You're going to do it, aren't you?<eos> Because you are not strong and you know you deserve to die.<eos> Don't move.<eos> Let me help you understand,<eos> I am not going to kill you.
Not tomorrow.<eos> Not ever.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> No, I don't, but only because you're wrong.<eos> I told you, Oliver, everyone in your orbit suffers as the price for your sins.
Find it quick.<eos> They're transferring me to Idaho tonight.<eos> Ahh. And once that happens, this offer's off the table.<eos> I don't want to see that happen, Oliver.<eos> Like I told you,
I never really took it seriously.<eos> Until now, right? Yeah.<eos> I have this really bad feeling.<eos> It's right in the pit of my stomach.<eos> What's it telling you?
I admire you, Oliver.<eos> It takes a special kind of idiot to actually get dumber with time.<eos> I am not in the mood, Malcolm.<eos> Human connections are what keep us human.<eos> And it's sad that it-- that it's a sociopath who's gonna have to point this out to you.
We're compromised.<eos> Take the prisoner out.<eos> - They're targeting Chase.<eos> - Go.<eos> I'll cover you.
Why did you involve William?<eos> That's my boy.<eos> He's an innocent.<eos> So was my wife, man, but you involved her.<eos> I already told you, Oliver.
Renard said he did.<eos> Where is he now?<eos> I don't know.<eos> He left.<eos> Nick, I really need to see you.
Yeah.<eos> I'll warn the others.<eos> Good luck.<eos> You too.<eos> If he hurts you, I will kill him.
No, he got it out to help you.<eos> Got it out from where?<eos> Where he keeps it hidden with the cloth wrapped around it.<eos> Kind of forgot I had it.<eos> Nick left it on the bed when he got out the stick to heal you.
I think he has to leave Portland.<eos> Renard won't stop until you're dead.<eos> Then maybe that's what you have to do.<eos> If I leave Portland, Renard will control everything.<eos> Nick, we can't afford to lose you.
It's nothing serious.<eos> So, I thought you had a thing for Clary.<eos> Clary? Why would you say that?<eos> Well, I mean, you know... now that she's not your sister, and she's... she's beautiful and fiery and...<eos> What is holding you back?
Simon, this isn't middle school.<eos> This is life or death.<eos> Have you been to middle school?<eos> Look, Seelies have the beauty of angels, and the viciousness of demons, and those opposing qualities makes them unpredictable.<eos> A vampire or a werewolf, they prefer to attack you head on, but Seelies, they want to trick you into your own self-destruction.
Of course.<eos> It's best that we keep our personal and professional lives separate.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I wanted to congratulate you on the promotion.
What are you doing here?<eos> I wanted to congratulate you on the promotion.<eos> I'm so pleased to see the Lightwoods back in command.<eos> I always knew this was your destiny.<eos> When you were little, I'd find you in here, sitting behind your father's desk, writing out your own memos in crayon.
Saving you.<eos> As usual.<eos> From a tree?<eos> That is called a kill tree.<eos> It would have wrapped its vines around you and torn you limb from limb.
I still am. Though your sister's presence is always heartening.<eos> As is yours, Meliorn.<eos> Well, tonight, I hope to erase that skepticism.<eos> Raphael...<eos> I wasn't sure I'd see you here.
Lucian. I just wanted to say, I am so sorry about Jocelyn.<eos> I feel terrible that I couldn't be at her Rite of Mourning.<eos> I couldn't either.<eos> The Clave banned all Downworlders from attending.<eos> It's nice to see you, Maryse.
Raphael is the leader of the Brooklyn clan.<eos> Our paths cross occasionally.<eos> For work.<eos> Speaking of work, I should probably join the group.<eos> It's nice to meet you, Sebastian.
Having its ups and downs.<eos> Are you Okay?<eos> Isabelle, you need to know something.<eos> Robert had an affair.<eos> So he finally told you.
I don't give a damn about the Cup.<eos> You took my sister, and you killed Jocelyn.<eos> I understand your concerns.<eos> When Luke gets back, we can discuss a neutral location for meetings.<eos> Might I speak to you for a moment?
Now I know there's a secondary door to the sub-cells through there, so I checked the security feeds.<eos> Luke disappears between the cameras.<eos> Someone's looping the footage?<eos> You're going to kill me like the feral animal that you are?<eos> No. I'm gonna kill you like a man.
Am I crazy, Sam, or is that...<eos> A wolf?<eos> Yeah!<eos> Look at all this mess you've made.<eos> Keep quiet... or I will have to punish you again.
Well, they let me keep the bottle to save her the trip.<eos> Here's how.<eos> So, I'm dipped in shit right now?<eos> Oh, no, this shit is permanent.<eos> Captain doesn't want you around anymore.
Hmm, you wouldn't know what to do.<eos> Oh, you gonna need that for your heart after diogo!<eos> Oi!<eos> Pampaw!<eos> -You old lady put you out? -Yeah.
I cut off one head.<eos> Plenty more where he came from.<eos> So we cut off all the heads.<eos> Rule the whole system.<eos> The system rules you, kid.
It's in a heck of a hurry to get somewhere.<eos> You know, I don't feel any acceleration, but, man, it sure looks like<eos> I'm leaving you guys in the dust.<eos> Hang tight there, amigo.<eos> We are tracking you.
How about we do the same up here?<eos> This guy's friends were probably infected.<eos> They would've spread it if you let them get away.<eos> It was the right call.<eos> What makes you think it's not gonna do the same thing to you the second you walk in there?
Miller!<eos> Hey! Trying to blow my eardrums?<eos> Listen, you need to move your ass in there.<eos> Earth's missiles are headed for Eros, and we're painting the bulls-eye.<eos> Don't put us in the really awkward position of having to blow you up.
The Blue Falcon.<eos> What are you seeing?<eos> It's kinda beautiful...<eos> Just get Julie to stop that rock.<eos> Then we'll come in and swoop you up.
I don't like it.<eos> Hey, we never really officially met.<eos> I'm Miller.<eos> I used to be a cop on Ceres.<eos> I was supposed to find you and bring you home.
We're headed that way anyway.<eos> Go to Venus.<eos> Work continues...<eos> I don't think I can.<eos> Look, kid, I came an awful long way to find you.
- I know.<eos> - I didn't want to hurt you.<eos> - Asked, answered.<eos> Hey...<eos> I'm glad that me and Naomi being together isn't an issue for you.
No, I have no idea where he is.<eos> We need to know what he knows.<eos> You should convince him to come in from the cold.<eos> How am I supposed to do that?<eos> He trusts you.
The way I see it, there's only three kinds of people in this world, bad ones, ones you follow, and ones you need to protect.<eos> What, so I'm the one you need to protect?<eos> Is that right?<eos> Yeah, there's nothing to be ashamed of.<eos> I let a breaching pod with 25 people get blown to pieces in order to protect you.
I love it.<eos> - Oh, it's nothing.<eos> - No, it's something.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I want to know about you.
If I give you too much information, are you gonna run?<eos> - What?<eos> - You like to fuck with people.<eos> Lure them in and kick 'em to the curb.<eos> - Does that scare you, Diane?
- Hi.<eos> - Chardonnay, please.<eos> You think this is a game?<eos> That I was trying to fuck with you?<eos> I just want to get to know you.
I mean, who are you?<eos> Really?<eos> You were at the party a few weeks ago.<eos> Yeah, hey, Frances.<eos> It's nice to see you again.
We like to disconnect in the evenings.<eos> - Oh. - Yeah. Okay.<eos> - Diane?<eos> - Hey!<eos> - It's so good to see you. - So glad you made it.
- Just seems so angry.<eos> - It's a long story.<eos> - Oh, no secrets, remember?<eos> Melissa Saugraves is a woman I... used to work with.<eos> Why is she telling you to stay away from her?
Therapy.<eos> Happy?<eos> Do you talk about me?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Jean, there's a woman asking for you in the front.
I'm looking for Melissa Saugraves.<eos> Does she still work there?<eos> Okay, do you know where?<eos> Thank you, thank you.<eos> There's something I wanted to tell you.
- Hi, Mom. - Hello.<eos> You're early.<eos> No, look, I'm right on time, actually.<eos> You look tired, haven't you been sleeping?<eos> Nice to see you, too.
You drive a mom car.<eos> It's my sister's.<eos> Get in.<eos> I can't believe you showed up like this.<eos> Well, maybe I'm not gonna let you off the hook so easily anymore.
It's important.<eos> Thanks.<eos> - Hey. - Hey.<eos> - Well, that's nice.<eos> I'm happy to see you.
Faster! Faster, faster!<eos> Stacey, Stacey, Stacey, look!<eos> Mommy!<eos> Hey, sweetie.<eos> I got finished early, so I thought I'd surprise you.
I missed you so much.<eos> I missed you, too, Melissa.<eos> It's gonna be okay, I promise.<eos> Uh, hey, Catherine, it's Michael calling.<eos> I'm sorry that it took me so long to call you back.
I saw it.<eos> Okay.<eos> I don't know what the fuck you expect me to do.<eos> This is not who I want to be, Jean.<eos> Look, I can't lose you... or Dolly.
- You fucking prick.<eos> Guys... please be civil.<eos> - You hate the video chat.<eos> - I don't hate the video chat, Dinesh.<eos> You've always hated the video chat, because it's my thing, and you wanna rewrite it to make it all about you.
You're not getting it. Please.<eos> Uh, I'm quitting.<eos> Wait.<eos> Richard, I was waiting out front!<eos> They want to ambush you and replace you with Big Head, but I had nothing to do with it.
No. No, he never cursed in front of his girls.<eos> Because he was trying to protect us.<eos> He never wanted us to see how dirty the world really is, but Father couldn't protect me and neither can you.<eos> Stop trying.<eos> All right, I'll stop trying to protect you and you stop trying to undermine me.
Thank you, Clegane.<eos> That warms the heart.<eos> But there's nothing special about you.<eos> You're right about that.<eos> So why does the Lord of Light keep bringing you back?
- Until... I meet Missandei from the Isle of Naath.<eos> Now I have fear.<eos> I do, too.<eos> No.<eos> I want to see you.
- Well, not at this very moment, no, but that's what we're discussing.<eos> What are we discussing?<eos> I have worked there for eight years.<eos> I can tell you every single thing that every person in that building is going to do and when.<eos> I can tell you what they look for. I can tell you what they see.
Can't taste it.<eos> This is not doing anything, nerve-wise or otherwise.<eos> Want to put that on my finger?<eos> When I called you, the last time...<eos> I had a feeling I was never going to see you again.
Fuck.<eos> Why, you pretty thing, you.<eos> What?<eos> You have an image problem.<eos> You need to think about your brand, how you want the world to see you.
Why, you pretty thing, you.<eos> What?<eos> You have an image problem.<eos> You need to think about your brand, how you want the world to see you.<eos> How you want Mr. World to see you.
Not ever.<eos> Not not ever.<eos> Meat's going to slide off you sooner or later, dead wife.<eos> Sooner if you keep soaking it in hot water.<eos> All that connective tissue holding you together. Well, that's gonna liquefy.
I can be very convincing.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Is this you being convincing now?<eos> Because you suck at it, unless you're trying to convince me you're an asshole.<eos> I'm trying to convince you to live.
You used to do everything by hand.<eos> Craft. Not manufacturing.<eos> Now this, this is craft.<eos> You could cut a line of throats with the best blade ever made from now until your grandchildren died, and not spill half the blood a gun could in a day.<eos> They make blood sacrifices to you.
-Shut the fuck up!<eos> Shut the fuck up before I fucking kill you!<eos> Stop it!<eos> I'm trying to read.<eos> Well, I might as well introduce you to everyone.
I was a pilot.<eos> Look, I wanted to be a regular pilot, but...<eos> So I became a drone pilot.<eos> There is a classified long range drone program here.<eos> Why should we trust you?
Kept on going on and on about his daughter, how he's gonna save the world.<eos> You'd sell out your friends just like that?<eos> Fuck 'em.<eos> You let me live, you can do whatever the hell you want to them.<eos> And why should I trust you?
I love him.<eos> You don't recognize me, do you?<eos> Jakie, Jakie, where are you?<eos> Why are we playing these games?<eos> I don't have to kill you, you know.
The last enemy to be destroyed "is death."<eos> In nomine Patris et Filii tu y Santos.<eos> Amen.<eos> Jim. What the hell are you doing here?<eos> If Falcone sees you, God only knows what he'll do.
You are a clever fellow, Tarquin, but... I wish Ed were here.<eos> My sole job as deputy chief of staff is to serve you with the exact same zeal and smarts as Mr. Nygma would.<eos> Thank you all so much for coming.<eos> Thanks, everyone.<eos> Bob, great to see you.
I don't... try.<eos> And I never stop.<eos> You won't see me coming.<eos> And you won't feel a thing.<eos> If we don't get a chance to talk before then, it's been really nice knowing you.
I never liked him.<eos> Nice place.<eos> What's with the raggedy clothes?<eos> Why are you back?<eos> To see you, of course.
Not just a five-year-old.<eos> Your five-year-old.<eos> Your daughter.<eos> That was a bad call.<eos> Okay? I just wanted to come here, and tell you that I love you.
I was headed back tomorrow.<eos> My money, where is it?<eos> 100 grand.<eos> I don't have your money.<eos> What do I have to do, beat it out of you?
You're better than that.<eos> Oh, that's so sweet.<eos> Would you stop it? Look, you want to blame me for Mario's death, that's fine.<eos> I can live with that, knowing you're okay.<eos> But don't let your hatred of me turn you into something you're not.
We've got a show to do, people.<eos> And, as you know, the show must go on.<eos> What the...<eos> Well, that is quite a story.<eos> You know, I know I've been dead, but doesn't that seem kind of crazy to you?
I get why you don't.<eos> You miss a lot being dead.<eos> You know what?<eos> Go ahead, enjoy it.<eos> There's about a hundred cops on the other side of that door ready to kill you all over again.
We have the building surrounded.<eos> There's no way out.<eos> Let the hostages go. You're outside?<eos> You are, aren't you?<eos> The cult will never follow you, Dwight.
Have her stick around, maybe get used to being my mom.<eos> Yes.<eos> You lied to me.<eos> I didn't tell you the truth.<eos> It's the same thing. Perhaps, but telling you your mother was a con artist who'd only sought you out for the purposes of getting money from me... didn't seem like a very attractive alternative.
Tonight, Gotham, in the darkness, there are no rules.<eos> So, tonight, Gotham... do what you want.<eos> Kill who you want. Hmm?<eos> And when morning comes... you, too, shall be... reborn.<eos> Dwight. I don't forgive you for my face.
You killed her, so you die.<eos> When I met you you were a nervous, jittery loser.<eos> You were nothing.<eos> I created Edward Nygma.<eos> And I am the only one in the world who truly sees you as you are.
- You can't trust him.<eos> - But I can trust you?<eos> Look, I'm sorry.<eos> I should've told you I suspected your mother of lying.<eos> - I was trying to protect you, Selina.
Correct.<eos> Thanks, buddy.<eos> I never doubted you.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> It's good to see you, too.
Now I'm not alone.<eos> Now... you can help me destroy them from within.<eos> Others have tried and failed, but with you and I working together inside the Court, we could bring the rule of democracy and law<eos> - back to Gotham.<eos> - Why should I trust you?
Now... you can help me destroy them from within.<eos> Others have tried and failed, but with you and I working together inside the Court, we could bring the rule of democracy and law<eos> - back to Gotham.<eos> - Why should I trust you?<eos> Why should I believe you?
You can speak in cryptic riddles all you want.<eos> I'm not scared of you.<eos> But you are scared of something, aren't you?<eos> Sit.<eos> Let me show you what I have to offer.
Carmine called the Court after you left.<eos> You shouldn't have gone there.<eos> It'll raise suspicions. Is it true?<eos> Why?<eos> I already told you... your father was determined to expose the Court and became a risk.
I know. You never did.<eos> Oh, boo-hoo. Is that what this is about?<eos> No one gave you a gold star for thuggery?<eos> If you're gonna kill me, then get on with it already.<eos> I ain't gonna kill you.
Untie us!<eos> You don't have to yell.<eos> Sorry. I just got so caught up in the moment.<eos> You know, I like the idea of an auction, Gabe.<eos> I think I'll auction you off to myself.
Any idea what it might be?<eos> Like I said, I had no idea that it had already arrived.<eos> It's clear that the Court no longer trusts me.<eos> Then why call me down here?<eos> I'm supposed to kill you.
Must you also hover while I work?<eos> I'd think you would prefer this to playing nursemaid to Fish Mooney.<eos> I was able to save Fish Mooney despite the fact that she had one foot in the grave.<eos> I took it as a personal challenge.<eos> Grandstanding doesn't suit you.
You think it's part of you, but it doesn't have to be.<eos> Do you know why you were so easily defeated?<eos> Your rage, Bruce.<eos> It blinds you.<eos> You seek to control it, and yet it controls you and has ever since that night.
Your rage, Bruce.<eos> It blinds you.<eos> You seek to control it, and yet it controls you and has ever since that night.<eos> Rage and pain are two sides of the same coin.<eos> I can release you from the pain of that night.
It'd have to be somewhere isolated, and small enough for them to control.<eos> I think I know where they took him.<eos> Just put them down wherever there's space, and then go back to where I found you.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Selina, I would like to introduce you to
There's another memory I want to start with.<eos> The first time you felt the rage after your parents' death...<eos> - Do you remember?<eos> - Yes.<eos> The rage from that day continues to burn inside of you, feeding on your pain, blinding you from everything else, and, if left unchecked, will one day consume you.
We need to remove it before that happens.<eos> You want me to give up my memory of that day?<eos> No.<eos> The events themselves will remain.<eos> I'm only talking about releasing you from the destructive emotions connected with them.
You've taken everything away from me.<eos> Everything.<eos> There's nothing left.<eos> And for what?<eos> I would ask you for the truth, but I honestly don't even think you know what that is anymore.
You want the truth?<eos> Fine.<eos> I killed Mario.<eos> I'm done apologizing for it.<eos> He was gonna kill you.
Jim, do I hear a favor coming on?<eos> What is coming into Dock 9C?<eos> Now I know who I am...<eos> I'm the Riddler.<eos> It's good to see you, too.
And nothing brings out the bourgeoisie quite like opening night at the theater.<eos> Where wilt thou lead me?<eos> Speak, for I will go no further.<eos> I say, Ghost, speak your business or I shall go no further!<eos> My business is not with you, Prince of Denmark.
You should have never gotten Nygma involved.<eos> I boosted the premium stuff, Otto.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> What the hell are you doing here?<eos> I wanted to see you.
Then the riddle will go unsolved.<eos> Fine!<eos> Let's go.<eos> Let me get this straight.<eos> So, this limo pulls up literally out of nowhere, and this creepy lady tells you to get in because
News flash, Ed!<eos> I'm not dead!<eos> That's true.<eos> For now.<eos> I came back from the dead to kill you, Ed.
over 2,000 square feet.<eos> You're saying they got a secret room there.<eos> Okay, but by your logic, there could be dozens of secret rooms throughout the city and the virus bomb could be in any one of them.<eos> You're in the club now.<eos> This Kathryn broad trusts you.
Stop that.<eos> Stop it!<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> I shall set you free, Bruce, free from the blinding rage of your darkest memory.
Since my first meeting...<eos> with some woman named Kathryn, I've had no contact with upper management.<eos> But... according to the guards' gossip, Court's planning some attack on the city.<eos> Fine.<eos> You want to kill me, I want to kill you.
All of you, with your weakness, your compromise.<eos> This place was a church to me.<eos> All right, that's enough of this.<eos> Bullock, you and Alfred take Kathryn out through the garage.<eos> I'm not leaving you alone with him.
He's probably stowed away in some safe house.<eos> Good thing I know where they all are.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Together again.<eos> Oh, I should've told you, Penguin's recruited an army of Hugo Strange's monsters.
Show me the weapon.<eos> I told you, Bruce, that I did not serve the Court.<eos> I... we made use of the Court for our own ends.<eos> The one I serve believes you have a great destiny.<eos> My task has been to prepare you for it, but a final step remains in your journey.
You really did it, huh?<eos> You injected yourself with the virus?<eos> You're just like Jim, you seem to think it's a bad thing.<eos> Where is he?<eos> He went to see you at your brownstone, and now we can't get in touch with him.
I should've known.<eos> But that's nothing but dense forest.<eos> - You'll never...<eos> - It's a place to start.<eos> We're gonna find you, brother, I promise.
I hope it was not the encounter with your manservant.<eos> If this is my destiny,<eos> I do not want to fail.<eos> You won't, Bruce.<eos> All this, everything the Court of Owls set in motion, everything I have done, has been to prepare you for this moment, and afterward,
I do not want to fail.<eos> You won't, Bruce.<eos> All this, everything the Court of Owls set in motion, everything I have done, has been to prepare you for this moment, and afterward,<eos> I will bring you to the one whose vision has singled you out.<eos> He is very eager to meet you.
Let Gotham fall so you may rise.<eos> Whatever destiny he's sold you, Bruce, he's lying.<eos> - Press it, Bruce. - Don't.<eos> Bruce, don't.<eos> I won't have him turn you into a murderer.
You need me.<eos> I can control this.<eos> That's why I'm not asking for your badge.<eos> Some of the guys are talking.<eos> These cops are gonna be watching you for the smallest sign.
Not to mention they've handed us the perfect opportunity.<eos> For what?<eos> The city is in total disarray.<eos> What better time to consolidate power?<eos> Barbara, I've told you again and again, I have no interest in running Gotham.
Not like this.<eos> Well... this is the only way, Jim.<eos> Just listen to the whispers.<eos> Killer.<eos> They'll lead you to me, tell you who you are.
Especially me.<eos> Don't move!<eos> What a surprise.<eos> My goodness, Harvey, you look awful.<eos> It's good to see you, too.
It's in his eyes.<eos> He has the virus.<eos> Really?<eos> So tell me, James, what's it feel like?<eos> Like it's taking all my willpower... not to kill you.
Both of them.<eos> Marvelous.<eos> Just marvelous.<eos> There he is, the real James Gordon.<eos> Nice to meet you, at last.
Alvarez, spread the word, Mayor James has called in the National Guard.<eos> We don't want any soldiers getting shot by mistake.<eos> Leave me alone.<eos> The hell's wrong with you?<eos> Alvarez, I'm talking to you.
What the hell is she doing here?<eos> One whiskey.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Well, this is a strange day.<eos> Never thought I'd see you in here.
Out.<eos> You've got the virus.<eos> Wow, you're not as dumb as I've heard.<eos> Are there any other glaringly obvious remarks you'd like to make?<eos> How about I cut your lungs out and show them to you?
That's the mother of all insults.<eos> The city is gonna pay us a lot of money to get Tetch back.<eos> We need to let that play out before we do anything rash.<eos> I know you two are close.<eos> But whatever you had, she treats you like dirt now.
Regroup?<eos> For what? !<eos> For whatever the hell I tell you to do!<eos> I'm not waiting anymore.<eos> She's broken every promise she's ever made to you...
But, unlike you, I am in the position to rectify my mistake.<eos> Prepare for one massive tantrum.<eos> That is not possible!<eos> It is my turn!<eos> It is my turn to kill you!
Well, believe me, if it weren't for Tabby, you'd have been dead a long time ago.<eos> You're trying to tell me she had nothing to do with this?<eos> - That's right.<eos> - So you've just gone behind her back, have you?<eos> I was gonna hit you before we got to the safe house.
Alfred, please.<eos> Please don't leave me.<eos> Here we are.<eos> Again.<eos> I have to tell you, this feels really great.
Any last words?<eos> I'm fine for now.<eos> I beg your pardon?<eos> I'll wait.<eos> I'm going to kill you, Oswald.
The Iceberg Lounge.<eos> Clever. 'Cause you're nicknamed Penguin, right?<eos> There's that.<eos> And then... there's the club's centerpiece attraction.<eos> I knew if I saw you, I might not have the courage to leave.
But if having the virus allowed Gotham to embrace its worst self, the cure should remind us there is always hope.<eos> A chance to remember who we can be rather than who we are.<eos> I don't know if Gotham deserves saving, but I do know one thing.<eos> If anyone can save it... it's you.<eos> And in return, I believe it can save you as well.
A chance to remember who we can be rather than who we are.<eos> I don't know if Gotham deserves saving, but I do know one thing.<eos> If anyone can save it... it's you.<eos> And in return, I believe it can save you as well.<eos> And then maybe one day, it will send you back to me.
Hey, are you okay?<eos> Yeah, these things have just been on the fritz lately.<eos> It makes me feel like a criminal.<eos> Hasn't been on the fritz, okay?<eos> Maybe if you charge the battery, like I told you to.
Yeah, you were a world-class jerk.<eos> Yeah, there is a reason.<eos> Because you are a world-class jerk?<eos> Fair enough.<eos> Listen, I've been trying really hard not to think about my alter ego, about what he did, and seeing you, it just... it brought it all back.
I'm afraid that I'm gonna wake up... be her.<eos> Maybe Julian can think of something that we haven't.<eos> Barry... when your mom was murdered,<eos> Joe and Iris, they took you in.<eos> Cisco, when Dante died, I slept on your couch to keep you company.
When I threw the Philosopher's Stone into the Speed Force,<eos> I accidentally ran to the future.<eos> I saw Savitar murder you.<eos> And I saw myself, and I...<eos> I wasn't fast enough to save you.
You lose, Barry.<eos> No!<eos> Just get us out of here.<eos> You had a rifle pointed at Savitar.<eos> Somehow telling you about Iris's death, it changed the future.
I am The Flash.<eos> Previously on The Flash...<eos> When I threw the Philosopher's Stone into the Speed Force, I accidentally ran into the future.<eos> I saw Savitar murder you.<eos> I wasn't fast enough to save you.
You know, he's just been looking forward to this for a long time; He's enjoying the moment.<eos> Well, I'm glad you have his back.<eos> We have each other's back.<eos> It's actually been really nice having him out there.<eos> Hey, I meant to ask you.
I would have gone with Barry.<eos> Barry? Cisco, what was that back there?<eos> First Golden Glider and now her?<eos> I can't help who I'm attracted to, even if it is the... sexy, intense, deadly ones.<eos> So she takes you back to Earth-19, and, what, you pay a fine?
No, no, he isn't.<eos> Okay, I am. I'm gonna fight you.<eos> Well, that one spoke first.<eos> What? That's like a real rule?<eos> By the laws of Earth-19, I hereby challenge you for possession of H.R. Wells.
I might not have done it, just being honest.<eos> Okay, all right.<eos> Lay it out for me.<eos> What are my chances here, scale of one to ten?<eos> She's gonna kill you.
"Fast and hard," okay, I kind of walked into that...<eos> Hey. Sorry.<eos> - Hey, sweetheart.<eos> - Hi. Hi, Iris.<eos> Hi. Good to see you, Cecile.
- Hi. Hi, Iris.<eos> Hi. Good to see you, Cecile.<eos> Um, Dad, can I borrow you for a second for a little father-daughter talk?<eos> I need to go catch up with Captain Singh, so I will be back in a little while, yeah?<eos> - It's good to see you.
- It's good to see you.<eos> - Good to see you too.<eos> So... what's up?<eos> How can I help you?<eos> Can I talk to you for a second over here?
What?<eos> Iris.<eos> What is going on with you?<eos> Joe, I'm sorry...<eos> Can I talk to you for a second?
I'm fine as hell.<eos> There he is.<eos> Didn't think you'd show.<eos> I wouldn't miss an evening with you, even if it is for a showdown.<eos> I will kill you, Cisco.
Savitar, he said that I trapped him wherever he is; You know what that means?<eos> Means I beat him.<eos> And I'm gonna do it again, I promise.<eos> So don't worry.<eos> The Flash is gonna save you.
Okay, well, we have one at S.T.A.R. Labs.<eos> Allen, this is an active investigation.<eos> There is protocol to follow... surely?<eos> Not if we're gonna figure this out.<eos> Okay, I'll bag the body myself and meet you there.
I... No, that's not it.<eos> It's...<eos> I've been...<eos> I've been letting you coast by on your raw talent, which you have a lot of, but teaching... it's a lot more than just doing something and expecting you to follow.<eos> It's about inspiring and empowering you to use your gifts to succeed on your own.
Sweetheart, take a look over there.<eos> I'm the only one doing the targeting here.<eos> That chick's husband is paying me twice my going rate, so scram.<eos> Look at this.<eos> The guy that's coming after you can do that with one touch.
It's okay.<eos> You're okay.<eos> Yorkin's done.<eos> What happened?<eos> I'll tell you what happened.
It's just with... what happened here, I want to make sure you feel safe.<eos> I do.<eos> About everything?<eos> You know, you've been saying for weeks that you were gonna save me from Savitar.<eos> - And while I trust you with my life, it was hard not to feel scared.
What?<eos> How about a signpost at the front?<eos> "All trespassers will be executed."<eos> That wouldn't be the worst idea, would it?<eos> Will be Solovar's great honor... to kill you... himself.
How do you benefit from this, Grodd?<eos> Solovar falls.<eos> I take his place.<eos> I rule the gorillas, and I promise to keep them in Gorilla City.<eos> How do we know we can trust you?
Best worst video game ever.<eos> Do you really think that Barry can beat Solovar?<eos> Well, he'd better, for all of our sakes.<eos> It's starting.<eos> After you die, your friends will follow you into the black.
Cisco's death would change the newspaper headline in the future.<eos> - Headline?<eos> - It's a long story.<eos> But it would also make another one come true, the one about Killer Frost.<eos> You want me to kill you?
Did you come here because you "live for danger"<eos> or to protect me?<eos> I just don't want to see you become something you're not.<eos> Okay, Cisco.<eos> I'm not gonna kill you, and neither is anyone else, okay?
I mean, we stopped a gorilla attack from happening.<eos> Yeah, look at you, changing the future.<eos> We're all changing the future, one headline at a time.<eos> Look, I don't know what the future's gonna bring, but I hope every day is with you.<eos> Which is why I wanted to ask you...
Barry Allen, will you be my friend?<eos> Always.<eos> H.R. made this for you.<eos> H.R. is an idiot.<eos> So there's something I've been meaning to tell you.
For what it's worth,<eos> I think Lisa Snart was totally into you.<eos> Lisa Snart.<eos> Not that I would actually let you date her.<eos> Cisco, I promise, there is a beautiful, intelligent woman out there who's gonna challenge you to be your best version of yourself.
And you make her happy.<eos> I'm gonna do everything in my power to keep it that way.<eos> I appreciate that, West.<eos> I'm sure Jesse will too, after I'm... gone.<eos> We're gonna come visit you on Earth-2 a bunch, so you don't have to worry about that, Harry.
If the secretary doesn't approve that budget first thing in the morning, we're gonna have to make some serious cuts...<eos> The hell was that?<eos> That damn gorilla almost got me this time.<eos> Shouldn't even have a scar.<eos> Do you remember anything from when Grodd was controlling you?
I think that sometimes, the only way to stop bad things from happening is to just get rid of what's causing them.<eos> What is this really about?<eos> Grodd or what happens to me?<eos> I kill Grodd, his attack never happens, that changes the future, and... you live, yeah.<eos> Your humanity, showing mercy, that is what separates you from everyone else.
Breach is taken care of.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Risky move coming to an Earth where interdimensional travel is punishable by death.<eos> Especially when I'm the one who's supposed to uphold that law.<eos> I need to talk to you.
Okay, I see you don't take no for an answer.<eos> Gypsy, please.<eos> He's gonna destroy my city.<eos> And he's gonna hurt the people I love.<eos> I told you before, that's not my problem.
Gypsy, please.<eos> He's gonna destroy my city.<eos> And he's gonna hurt the people I love.<eos> I told you before, that's not my problem.<eos> Look, just go back to Earth-1 before someone sees you and I have to do something that I don't want to.
All you care about is mercy.<eos> Yeah, you're right.<eos> Except I'm not the only one that wants to stop you.<eos> Solovar!<eos> I challenge you, Grodd!
- Look who I found.<eos> - Hey, guys.<eos> - How are we doing?<eos> - Julian.<eos> It's good to see you.
Really.<eos> I mean, as long as I can get that plus-one.<eos> 'Cause, you know, me and Gypsy, we about to tear up the dance floor for you guys.<eos> Barry.<eos> - Can I talk to you for a second? - Yeah, yeah.
And that's a great story.<eos> But you missed the point?<eos> I... yeah, I...<eos> I don't... it was spontaneous.<eos> I knew you'd say yes, and I wanted to surprise you.
Because we had to be.<eos> Only one of us could live.<eos> You thought that Thawne and Zoom were your biggest foes, but... but it's me.<eos> It's always been me, Barry.<eos> Man, what did we ever do to you?
Tell my sister why you asked her to marry you.<eos> Go on, tell her the real reason, Barry.<eos> What is he talking about?<eos> Barry.<eos> The night that Savitar kills you, you didn't have a ring on your finger.
But I won't let that happen.<eos> I'm gonna do everything in my power to change the future, and I'm the only one fast enough to keep her alive.<eos> I am The Flash.<eos> Previously, on "The Flash"...<eos> The night that Savitar kills you, you didn't have a ring on your finger.
And this is something I have to do alone, okay?<eos> Fine.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Okay, let's go to work.<eos> Can I talk to you?
Okay, okay. I mean, hats off to you.<eos> You really are Hard-Hat Harry's little girl, aren't you?<eos> Yeah, I am, and you're not him.<eos> So just do us both a favor and stop trying to be.<eos> This troubles you.
I don't know that we can.<eos> Hello?<eos> Wally?<eos> Wally, Wally!<eos> I'm gonna get you out, okay?
I'm still not... moving...<eos> That was oddly satisfying.<eos> What's happening to him?<eos> Wally West is caught in an endless temporal loop, just like Savitar after you imprisoned him here in the future.<eos> No wonder he hates you.
What? What are you talking about?<eos> We both know that a speedster needs to take Wally's place.<eos> That's why I'm here.<eos> No, no, Jay, you already lived your hell when you were Zoom's prisoner.<eos> And you set me free, and I owe you for that.
Time's finally come for me to cross it, but you... you, Barry, need to put an end to this once and for all and stop Savitar.<eos> How?<eos> Do what you do best.<eos> Be The Flash.<eos> Cisco said that he could use this to track you... and bring you home.
How?<eos> Do what you do best.<eos> Be The Flash.<eos> Cisco said that he could use this to track you... and bring you home.<eos> I'm gonna get this back to you again, when I break you out of here.
He's just a man, baby.<eos> - A man?<eos> Thank you for saving Wally.<eos> Of course.<eos> Um, so, I just... Look, you told me that you only wanted to marry someone because they love you and not because they were trying to save you, and I get that.
It's the same reason that I wanna marry you.<eos> I wanna be your wife, Barry.<eos> I love you.<eos> But, you were right.<eos> I proposed... because I thought it would save you.
I wanna be your wife, Barry.<eos> I love you.<eos> But, you were right.<eos> I proposed... because I thought it would save you.<eos> I thought Wally would save you.
What just happened to him?<eos> Wally has taken my place in the Speed Force.<eos> It's okay, we're going home.<eos> What Wally saw, it's gonna haunt him for a while.<eos> I proposed because I thought it would save you.
He is not my boyfriend.<eos> He... he's just a boy.<eos> Who is not my friend.<eos> - He's my nothing. - Okay.<eos> All right, uh, well, whoever he is said that this guy whammied you, and then he escaped to my Earth, he showed up at S.T.A.R. Labs, I went after him to try to get him to wake you up...
One look, and you can see that.<eos> And she wants to be with him.<eos> No matter how scared she was to tell you, no matter how dangerous it is to be with him, all that matters is, they're together.<eos> And when you find a love like that, well... you gotta hold on to it.<eos> No matter who's trying to stop you.
I know that look.<eos> What is going on inside that head of yours?<eos> This guy knew what was going on with you and me and Savitar.<eos> If he knows something about Savitar, then...<eos> He might be the key to saving you.
I mean, if she gets ahold of him, she's gonna take him back to Earth-19.<eos> We can figure that out later.<eos> Right now, we just need to find him.<eos> I got nothing.<eos> Why can't I find you?
We can figure that out later.<eos> Right now, we just need to find him.<eos> I got nothing.<eos> Why can't I find you?<eos> I told you, this guy is smart.
I'm putting some search parameters into the S.T.A.R. Labs satellite to see if anybody vibrates at a different frequency than Earth-1 folk.<eos> Wish we had a satellite that could do that on my Earth.<eos> Wish I had a bunch of this stuff.<eos> Oh. I could hook you up, girl.<eos> How about this, I spend a few days on Earth-19, and set you up with something state-of-the-art.
It's merely a flesh wound, as the "Monty Python" boys would say.<eos> Anyway, thanks for patching me up.<eos> Of course.<eos> Listen, I've been trying to find the right time to say this, and... now seems to be as good a time as any.<eos> I was so focused on not hurting you... as Killer Frost... that I forgot that I could hurt you as Caitlin Snow, and for that I'm very sorry.
I would just... sit in your room... and watch you sleep.<eos> I put my hand on your chest, just to make sure you were breathing, and then I...<eos> I would just sit there there, praying that... you'd just keep breathing.<eos> That's how I feel right now.<eos> I don't know what I can do to save you.
So every move we make, every trap we try and set, it's all just history to them.<eos> They're armed with the future.<eos> Well, not anymore.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> If the answers that we need to stop Savitar and save you are in the future, then that's where I need to go.
Previously on "The Flash"...<eos> Despite your feeble efforts to change the future, you can't.<eos> Everything's the same.<eos> The future has not changed.<eos> If the answers that we need to stop Savitar and save you are in the future, then that's where I need to go.
Make sure that him and Wally...<eos> Stop, okay?<eos> We're not gonna talk about this.<eos> You're not gonna die.<eos> I told you, I have a plan.
I know you don't.<eos> But I do.<eos> Stop!<eos> Aw, come to save the day?<eos> Good, now I can get rid of you, too.
- Not anymore, okay?<eos> - Well, Cisco...<eos> I can't.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Look, it's good to see you in any time.
Come to see how things turn out for Team Flash?<eos> I wanted to see what happened to my friend.<eos> I am not your friend, Flash.<eos> I'm so sorry I did this to you.<eos> I should have saved you.
Where is he?<eos> Well, he's not here, which means there's only one other place he can be.<eos> Hey, Joe.<eos> Why are you here, Barry?<eos> I just wanted to see you.
You want to cure me?<eos> Turn me back into Caitlin Snow?<eos> No.<eos> I want to make sure Caitlin... never returns.<eos> Why should I trust you?
Next time you decide to release my friend's inner ice demon, you do it sometime in July.<eos> I was trying to save her life, Cisco.<eos> When I became Killer Frost,<eos> Savitar appeared to me and showed me the way.<eos> If the answers that we need to stop Savitar and save you are in the future, then that's where I need to go.
All right, I'm gonna get her to head back this way.<eos> When she does, you gotta knock her out, okay? - Okay?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Now, Cisco!<eos> Savitar says I'm not allowed to kill you, but I can't have you following me around.
You don't have to do this.<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> - Why? Because Savitar commands it?<eos> He's not a god.<eos> He's just a man that's using you.
Go. Go. Go.<eos> Caitlin.<eos> You're alive.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I had to stop you to save you.
- Yeah. I knew that it meant that we moved up a level in our relationship.<eos> And... for me, that level comes with a lot of baggage.<eos> Like Killer Frost and The Flash?<eos> Yeah. So you thought that pushing me away was the thing to do?<eos> I thought that I was protecting you.
Cecile Horton... I love you.<eos> I love you with all my heart.<eos> And I'm sorry that I was dishonest with you.<eos> And from now on, there will be no secrets between us.<eos> - Mm. I should have told you a long time ago.
You don't just know what's gonna happen to us.<eos> You were there.<eos> You lived it.<eos> You remember... when you were me.<eos> Like I told you from the beginning...
That means she's working with Savitar.<eos> - So you talked to Cecile?<eos> - Told her everything.<eos> Told her I love her. I told her that you're The Flash.<eos> Like I told you from the beginning...
Your duplicate died, saving the multiverse, and you continued your happy little life.<eos> And it would've stayed that way, but then you decided to play God.<eos> You created Flashpoint and changed everything.<eos> I went to the future.<eos> My future self told me that he created time remnants to stop you.
Are you sure I don't go by "Bart"? Can...<eos> "Bart" feels more natural to me.<eos> - Can we go with Bart?<eos> - Bart's kinda cool.<eos> Okay, hey. Let's just get you back in the chair.
- Yearbook? - Yeah.<eos> - And anime club? - Yeah.<eos> You loved... loved... "Dragon Ball Z."<eos> I don't know what that is.<eos> Yeah, I couldn't explain that show to you - even if I wanted to, so... - Okay.
My dad brought you inside, and... you were in shock... you weren't even crying.<eos> And later that night, a sound woke me, and I crawled out of my bed, and I realized that the sound was coming from downstairs.<eos> I peered over the banister, and... I found you crying alone.<eos> I knew I had to go to you.<eos> I sat next to you, and... you put your head in my lap, and I held you while you cried.
I never loved any of you.<eos> She's gone?<eos> Maybe too far gone now.<eos> We'll figure out a way to get her back.<eos> Just like we figured out how to get you back.
We'll figure out a way to get her back.<eos> Just like we figured out how to get you back.<eos> You sure this is the me you want?<eos> With all the baggage?<eos> Seeing you without the weight of everything that's happened, seeing you happy, like you were before your mother was killed?
Just like we figured out how to get you back.<eos> You sure this is the me you want?<eos> With all the baggage?<eos> Seeing you without the weight of everything that's happened, seeing you happy, like you were before your mother was killed?<eos> Without all of that darkness haunting you, you were finally free.
I have to cure myself of Caitlin.<eos> This has to happen.<eos> I don't wanna fight you.<eos> I don't wanna fight you, either.<eos> I wanna kill you.
My sister had him fetch it from the Maxwells.<eos> He doesn't even know what it is.<eos> Look, I am partially responsible for the damage she inflicts on the world.<eos> If I want to make good, that starts with killing Sybil.<eos> I'm just having a hard time taking you seriously because of everything you've done.
With Elena.<eos> Yeah, I'm aware of that.<eos> It meant something to you.<eos> And this event, this place, it only means something to you because of the feelings you attach to it.<eos> Your lizard brain is trying to remind you of the truth.
Oh, yes, you are, Matt.<eos> I'm about to burn Mystic Falls to the ground.<eos> I ain't gonna let it happen.<eos> I will do whatever it takes.<eos> I'm getting you back.
Well, except we're on a mission.<eos> We'll still end up at the same destination.<eos> Why not make the journey an adventure?<eos> Second chances, coming up.<eos> I dare you to have one of these and tell me that they are not the best pancakes you ever... had.
Well, there's no point now.<eos> Cade's in town.<eos> He set our boy free.<eos> What?<eos> He also told me to kill you.
No. That's just his vacation home.<eos> He's here to stay.<eos> Does your plan âBâ account for that?<eos> Of course it does.<eos> This may come as a surprise to you, but you're not the only optimist in town.
Enzo?<eos> What...<eos> Bonnie asked him.<eos> He said yes.<eos> They were going to tell you.
I don't get it.<eos> Sure you do.<eos> Think about it.<eos> Can you blame her?<eos> I'll call you when I'm close.
I made a deal.<eos> The deal's off.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> You're human, and you're of no use to him.<eos> He's giving you until midnight, and then he wants you dead.
That's good.<eos> I want you to focus on the metronome.<eos> And listen to the sound of my voice.<eos> I want you to close your eyes and relax.<eos> Now I'm gonna lead you down a long path.
Where's the smoking gun in this story, huh?<eos> Why is the journal so important?<eos> Hey, listen, he can't control what he's seeing, Damon.<eos> Enzo, we call on you.<eos> One who loves you is reaching out to you.
We need to bury him.<eos> If Enzo's in there and we bury him, he'll be trapped.<eos> There must be a way to free him.<eos> No.<eos> Whatever darkness you reached into is reaching back for you.
If Enzo's in there and we bury him, he'll be trapped.<eos> There must be a way to free him.<eos> No.<eos> Whatever darkness you reached into is reaching back for you.<eos> I'm not gonna leave you in there.
Just stay here.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> The cure is in you.<eos> My blood won't work.<eos> I can't save you.
Oh, God.<eos> The cure is in you.<eos> My blood won't work.<eos> I can't save you.<eos> I can't save you.
How long have you been waiting there?<eos> Not long.<eos> - Liar.<eos> - Seriously.<eos> I've been hypnotized, almost died of a heart attack, and lost the only means of killing the devil, and then I came here to tell you how sorry I am about Enzo.
I heard they pumped you full of three pints of blood.<eos> I hope you saved me some.<eos> It's a good thing that wasn't funny, otherwise I'd be, uh ripping my stitches.<eos> Well, why don't you take a seat.<eos> I poured you a painkiller-friendly drink, and I'll sit with you and remind you how badly you always wanted to be human.
The girls are fine.<eos> We've just been on the road.<eos> Where are you now?<eos> Uh, at the Armory.<eos> Hey, listen, uh, I was thinking, maybe we could, I don't know, come by and meet you at the house tonight.
I can't.<eos> I have too much left to make up for.<eos> I meant it would be easier on Caroline.<eos> Have you even considered what your attempts at redemption will mean for her life?<eos> 50 years of following you around.
What do we do?<eos> - I know what to do.<eos> - Okay, tell me.<eos> What do we do?<eos> We find a way to redeem you.
What are you talking about?<eos> I'm talking about atonement.<eos> I'm talking about a giant, noble gesture of selfless generosity.<eos> - I hate this already.<eos> - You need something that's gonna push you over the edge in the eyes of Cade.
I actually tried killing someone.<eos> Pretty sure that makes me just as bad as him.<eos> I've hurt people for the wrong reasons, too.<eos> But that feeling in your gut?<eos> That voice telling you to hate yourself for what you did?
Oh, I think you got a foot taller.<eos> Who's hungry?<eos> - Me!<eos> - I am!<eos> It's good to see you.
Who's hungry?<eos> - Me!<eos> - I am!<eos> It's good to see you.<eos> It's good to see you.
I'm going to give you an understanding of what you've become.<eos> I want you to remember the moment of Enzo's death.<eos> When Enzo died, you screamed.<eos> A powerful psychic blast created an entire world, like what I did.<eos> Enzo, I thought I'd never see you again.
What happens if I refuse to play fetch?<eos> In layman terms?<eos> - I drag your soul to hell.<eos> - Go for it.<eos> I'd rather burn than serve you for another second.
How about this?<eos> You give me the dagger, and I'll kill him.<eos> Cade's the devil.<eos> I looked into his eyes when I was handing over Elena, and I decided that it's not worth the risk.<eos> Why would I trust you?
- if you don't get involved.<eos> - Great.<eos> Another Salvatore brother freezing me out.<eos> Stefan told me that he needed to go on some spirit walk to God knows where, figure out if he wants to be with me.<eos> Well, in his... tiny human brain, I'm sure he thinks he's protecting you.
Your soul belongs to me.<eos> I'm psychic, remember?<eos> I know you can hear me.<eos> Hiding ain't my style, Cade.<eos> Annoying you, on the other hand...
Bonnie, wake up.<eos> Please.<eos> Bonnie, wake up.<eos> Nice save.<eos> For the record, this doesn't mean I forgive you.
I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that<eos> Katherine won't let the ceremony get that far.<eos> Caroline and Bonnie are probably already rehearsing.<eos> You don't want to seem unprepared.<eos> Look... what happened to Enzo is gonna haunt you and her for the rest of your lives.
With the power recently vested in me by the Commonwealth of Virginia, I now pronounce you husband and wife.<eos> You may kiss the bride, little brother.<eos> Why send the necklace, but skip the wedding?<eos> Maybe she wants to stand you up for old times' sake.<eos> Hmm. So nice having you back, Bon.
She's not in the house.<eos> Damon's checking the grounds and the cemetery.<eos> Have you tried the high school?<eos> That's my next stop.<eos> Okay, I'll meet you there.
- They have you.<eos> Come on. Get them to the Armory, I'll meet you there.<eos> - I promise.<eos> - No.<eos> I don't need to remind you what it's like to lose your mother.
Family first.<eos> We're family now.<eos> Okay?<eos> You and me and the girls.<eos> It's just... please, please, don't make me leave you.
You can tell her yourself.<eos> I need to do this, Damon.<eos> I owe it to Bonnie and Enzo.<eos> I owe it to a lot of people.<eos> I'm not gonna leave you to die here, Stefan.
Which means a lot less without you.<eos> Do you think I want this?<eos> I just got married.<eos> My wife is out there, waiting for me to come home to her.<eos> But in the nearly two centuries since I made you become a vampire, I have fought to turn you into the man who deserves the happiness that's out there right now.
Hi, honey.<eos> Is this Matt's trump card?<eos> Well, it won't work.<eos> You're about 15 years too late to be paternal.<eos> I'm not here to talk you out of it.
Hi.<eos> What happened?<eos> Why am I here right now?<eos> I don't know about Bonnie, but Damon...<eos> Damon wanted to sacrifice everything to save you, to save this town.
I wanted that Damon to live.<eos> And I wanted you to have an opportunity to get to know him.<eos> He's the better man.<eos> He's the right man.<eos> It's good to see you, Elena.
Because we're running out of time and you're our only option?<eos> No.<eos> Because I'm awesome.<eos> Because I take risks for my friends and I don't need your thanks.<eos> Am I supposed to be thanking you for something?
- Well, I suppose that's my cue.<eos> - Dick.<eos> Remember what I said, Lucifer.<eos> Bye-bye, Daniel.<eos> I just came by to tell you that Chloe's looking for you.
Because it's about his beloved Chloe.<eos> He'll take it better from you.<eos> You're his closest friend.<eos> Lucifer may be stubborn, but he listens to you.<eos> Hate to break it to you, but if you're buttering me up, it ain't gonna work.
What's Amenadiel doing with Chloe's mum?<eos> I think you already know.<eos> Don't toy with me, Mother.<eos> What is this?<eos> I've been trying to find the right way to tell you.
Well, if anyone has a better suggestion, by all means, speak up now.<eos> Quite frankly, I'd prefer to Uber there.<eos> But... look, I am doing this with or without you.<eos> Well, I'm sorry.<eos> Having spent millennia in that terrible place, I can't be part of you going back.
Uriel...<eos> I know.<eos> It's a lot to take in, isn't it?<eos> I don't...<eos> I-I don't understand, Azrael's blade, it should've destroyed you, not sent you to Hell.
Follow me.<eos> I hate you.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> I-I know. I know.<eos> Hurts you more than it does me.
This isn't your fault.<eos> It's mine.<eos> I am to blame for all of this.<eos> Ever since... ever since I returned, I've been... I've been manipulating you.<eos> Stoking your anger against your Father in hopes of using you against Him.
I am to blame for all of this.<eos> Ever since... ever since I returned, I've been... I've been manipulating you.<eos> Stoking your anger against your Father in hopes of using you against Him.<eos> But... but I've just made things worse.<eos> I pushed you and that human closer, knowing it would crush you when you learned the truth.
I pushed you and that human closer, knowing it would crush you when you learned the truth.<eos> And now look at us.<eos> Stuck in this prison while Chloe is dying.<eos> No. I killed Uriel because I had to.<eos> To save you.
♪ And I'm keeping your eyes on me, aye ♪<eos> ♪ When the beat keep knocking, drinks get to flowing ♪<eos> ♪ You gon' like the way my body going ♪<eos> ♪ There ain't one in this place... ♪<eos> Surprised to see you here.
Come on.<eos> You can trust me, Ma.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on, Cook.<eos> I'll be out here to take you home when you're done.
But acting like it's personal with me.<eos> There you go.<eos> Lesson one.<eos> It's business, of course.<eos> But no matter what anybody tells you, it's always personal.
They're still going through the security footage.<eos> Thirsty might know more about it.<eos> Okay, I'm gonna go get caught up.<eos> - Hey, Thirsty.<eos> - Nice to have you back.
What's Freda doing?<eos> She's making a drop.<eos> She used to work around her daddy.<eos> She know her way around.<eos> Let me introduce you to somebody.
Yeah, he got bodied back in Philly about a year and a half ago.<eos> - Do you know who made the hit?<eos> ‭ - No.<eos> You're lying.<eos> I'm gonna put you in WITSEC so you'll feel free to talk.
I'd never put my hands on her, okay?<eos> I take mood stabilizers.<eos> That's it.<eos> Mood stabili...<eos> And I'm supposed to trust you with my business.
Yeah, just like that.<eos> Let her feel your heartbeat.<eos> I don't need your little drink.<eos> This ain't a social call.<eos> I'm here to tell you: step back. All right?
Answer your phone.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> - Campaign manager. - Mm-hmm.<eos> You know who this is, it's Tariq.<eos> Maybe if he puts you in a lockdown situation, you're gonna roll or something like that.
Go ahead.<eos> - Campaign manager. - Mm-hmm.<eos> You know who this is, it's Tariq.<eos> Maybe if he puts you in a lockdown situation, you're gonna roll or something like that.<eos> Oh, so I'm supposed to do time again to protect you? Uh-uh.
Believe that.<eos> ‭Come on, baby.<eos> So, what is this, you...<eos> you putting on a show for me?<eos> Who told you?
No, I'm just mad that you get so freakin' upset at me about that little stuff with the studio.<eos> How do you get that mad at me, man?<eos> Look, anyway, what I realized is that the confines of that little bitty studio is too small to contain a movement.<eos> Welcome to the true studio.<eos> I mean, where every note will melt you to the core, but at the same time, it refreshes you.
I didn't mean to...<eos> If you see what I see, you'd be laughing, too.<eos> I'm so sure.<eos> I mean, look at you.<eos> Last time I saw you, I was barely able to recognize you because of that addiction.
Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Well.<eos> I'm sorry we got off to such a messy start... but I'm still available to do business if you're interested.<eos> How long has he been doing this to you?
It's about... a lifetime, about the risks two people take when their lives and their destinies cross.<eos> It was always about the music.<eos> Lucious's music was the very air that I breathed.<eos> It was the blood pumping through my veins.<eos> And when music can do that to you, whew, that's when you know.
All day, every day, huh?<eos> That man has always been a terrible influence on you.<eos> Loretha.<eos> Barry, hey.<eos> Haven't seen you around school.
- We will bring you the results...<eos> - Mom?<eos> - Hey, you.<eos> - Hey.<eos> I wanted to thank you, for backing me up on that Vegas deal.
They're dead.<eos> They're all dead.<eos> I'm not trying to recruit you, but you need to know, things are changing.
You remember Kelly Kline?<eos> This is not a baby.<eos> This is the spawn of Lucifer.<eos> Kelly, the angels? They want you dead.<eos> But I can protect you.
I know what I saw.<eos> Gwen...<eos> She's gonna sleep like a baby.<eos> Hey. It's okay. You're gonna be okay.<eos> It must really burn you, knowing I'm the one who put you in this prison.
See, I understand that whatever sad little scheme that you're brewing up, I'm already 10 steps ahead.<eos> And I thought pride was my sin.<eos> It's not pride.<eos> It's fact. You cross me, I crush you.<eos> You hit me, I hit you back twice as hard.
Before we, let you out, we have a few... well, I wouldn't call them demands, exactly.<eos> So hellhounds are invisible to humans... unless you sold your soul, and they're after you.<eos> Or, you're wearing a pair of these.<eos> They're glasses treated with holy fire.<eos> All right, Crowley and I are gonna hit the woods, see if we can't track down Cujo. You stick with Sam. He'll keep you safe.
It's been warded with runes and spellwork from the Cage, carved into every molecule.<eos> In there?<eos> I own you.<eos> I'm just getting started. So...<eos> I'm gonna put you back in your hole, and then I'm gonna go find your spawn, and I'm gonna rip him apart while you watch.
All right, well, we'll spread the word. Let us know if you find anything.<eos> Of course.<eos> You ready, brother?<eos> He sound weird to you?<eos> Is that your computer talking to you again?
No, we hate them. Us. Together.<eos> I-I get that. Yeah, I do.<eos> Dean, because of Mick and his guys, the Alpha Vampire is dead.<eos> But if... if we can save people, then it...<eos> Either way, I-I shouldn't have lied to you. And...
- Thanks, Daisy's dad.<eos> Alright?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> - Why are you smiling?<eos> - Nice to see you too.
Hi, this is Trish and Leah.<eos> Leave us a message.<eos> I heard what happened, Trish.<eos> I had to come here.<eos> I had to see you.
No, sorry.<eos> Good.<eos> Cos it's you I want to see.<eos> Me?<eos> I tried to talk to you earlier, at the football, but there were too many people around.
You really didn't have to do all this.<eos> Oh, it's not me, is it, it's Ed.<eos> He wouldn't let me come here without half the shop.<eos> I just find it quite hard that everyone seems to know now.<eos> Nobody is judging you.
- I know.<eos> - You and Lizzie and Mum and Dan.<eos> - I'm just sorry if if sometimes that wasn't enough.<eos> Dad, er... why don't you come round?<eos> - I'd like to see you.
I'm so sorry you feel this way.<eos> I'm sorry you're lost.<eos> I'm sorry you feel alone.<eos> I am listening to you, I'm hearing everything you say.<eos> But, Mark, your grief is still overwhelming you.
I don't want to see anyone.<eos> - We could go for a walk? - No!<eos> Well, what if he's watching?<eos> And follows us?<eos> - What if he sees you?
- Yeah, I want to.<eos> I thought, I can sleep here on the sofa, and you could have my room for now... - ... just so you get some rest. - No, Chlo.<eos> Yeah, till you're better.<eos> Till the two of you, you know, work everything out.<eos> It's good to have you back, Dad.
Yeah, till you're better.<eos> Till the two of you, you know, work everything out.<eos> It's good to have you back, Dad.<eos> You definitely all right with this?<eos> Yeah. Leave you to settle in, give you some space.
- It's not like that!<eos> - It's never like that, is it?<eos> It's never your fault.<eos> You've cost me my job.<eos> You have no idea what this life is gonna do to you.
Can I come in?<eos> This is really bad of me, Trish, I can't pretend otherwise.<eos> So, I...<eos> I had some spyware put on your computer.<eos> And I've been watching you through your webcam.
Because I missed you.<eos> Because I... I blew what we had.<eos> And my life since then has been so empty.<eos> There's this... chasm... where you used to be.<eos> I just wanted to see you.
There's this... chasm... where you used to be.<eos> I just wanted to see you.<eos> Be with you.<eos> I... I was... I tried to take it off but the police got wind of it.<eos> And I thought I should tell you rather than them.
I don't live here.<eos> Come on, least you can do is be honest with me.<eos> I don't think we can be together.<eos> I always have.<eos> So much. I remember when I used to see you and I... ..I felt like my body was bursting.
You don't have a microphone like I do.<eos> I don't know what to say!<eos> Don't say anything.<eos> But know this, meatball.<eos> I will win you back.
After the second death.<eos> This is DI Clayton, change of plan.<eos> You can release Anthony Huxley.<eos> You know, one day, Harry's luck is going to run out.<eos> You're not careful, he's going to take you down with him.
Go on, have fun.<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> - If I could take it off...<eos> - Don't.<eos> - I keep trying to tell you.
- We need your help.<eos> - You want to help me?<eos> Find my son!<eos> - It's Joyner.<eos> He wants to see you.
Look, he's damaged goods.<eos> I can reach him.<eos> The story of this conspiracy starts in Afghanistan.<eos> Until we understand that, we don't understand anything.<eos> "And you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free."
I spoke with her.<eos> - With all due respect to your mom...<eos> - N-N-No.<eos> J-Just hear me out, okay?<eos> The people who are behind this, they took down the government, th-they... th-they killed that FBI agent's little boy, and they almost killed you.
I wish I could, guys.<eos> I got to shower and head back to work.<eos> Oh, would you listen to this guy?<eos> You sound like a freshman all over again.<eos> Callie flew in from New York just to see you.
And now I have nothing.<eos> Since you took Harry from me.<eos> You had to make sure I had nothing didn't you?<eos> We are in the bowels of my building.<eos> If you're lucky, the caretaker might find you in time.
He'll see.<eos> I wasn't sure if you'd come.<eos> I didn't do it.<eos> I wouldn't have told you I was here if I had.<eos> I couldn't look you in the eye.
Am I looking after Daisy? No.<eos> Where's Rich?<eos> I asked him to give us some space.<eos> Is this an intervention?<eos> I don't want to stop you gambling.
You burnt a man?<eos> What kind of sick bastard are you?<eos> Well, I have no idea what you're talking about, but you have my full attention.<eos> You're seriously trying to tell me you weren't responsible for this?<eos> That's exactly what I just told you.
Nice one Steve.<eos> (SPY MUSIC STARTING)<eos> Eve.<eos> I need you to track the location of a phone.<eos> Don't you have that little doe-eyed sergeant to run around after you?
- ANNA: I hardly do that.<eos> - It's all you do.<eos> About Daisy, about your marriage<eos> I mean it's like suddenly I don't have clearance.<eos> Well to be honest, my family doesn't have anything to do with you.
Isabella.<eos> Well, what do you expect?<eos> You told me to keep away from her, so of course I went to see her.<eos> She convinced me that the bracelet was real.<eos> She could've killed you.
A leak in the brake fluid container of Harry's car.<eos> When he was out that night, he was essentially driving without brakes.<eos> I don't think he believes it was an accident.<eos> When I met you, I thought you must've been sent.<eos> Rest assured we will find the evidence to put you away for a long, long time.
The place is just as I left it.<eos> I've never heard of your girl.<eos> I can't help you.<eos> Is that clear enough?<eos> Just to keep you updated.
You alright?<eos> Yeah.<eos> No I'm fi, just err, got a lot to organise.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> Am I allowed to tell you, you look like shit?
You'd have to wish me dead.<eos> That isn't you.<eos> You don't think like that.<eos> You're too good.<eos> I wish I'd met you before.
That isn't you.<eos> You don't think like that.<eos> You're too good.<eos> I wish I'd met you before.<eos> Seen you with your daughters.
Should we go answer the door?<eos> It's Auntie Maggie!<eos> Ready for your birthday breakfast?<eos> You know what, Mags?<eos> That was... that was really, really, really kind of you, but you shouldn't have bothered.
Who are those from?<eos> A card says "Dana."<eos> Boy Dana or girl Dana?<eos> Maybe I could stop having a birthday.<eos> Or you could just tolerate the fact that it's a 24-hour period where the people who love you can treat you extra special.
Yeah. This should go well.<eos> Maggie. - You're pretty.<eos> - Ah. No one ever looks like their profile picture.<eos> It usually goes the other way.<eos> Well, I'm so glad I didn't disappoint you.
I can rate her using the app, which aggregates profiles, so the next guy that goes in...<eos> He's got the full picture.<eos> - You've got to be kidding me.<eos> - Don't worry. I'm rolling out another version... for the ladies.<eos> So I could rate you.
Aisha, I promise that I will work as hard as I can for your father.<eos> And if everything goes well, then we'll...<eos> Dr. Reid, they're ready in the O.R.<eos> Okay, will you stay with Aisha, please?<eos> I'll come and find you as soon as the surgery's over.
It's just the phone.<eos> It's rude.<eos> Wow! Here we go.<eos> Five minutes, and you're already a clinger.<eos> No, I'm not, and I'm gonna prove it to you by saying goodbye.
You two will be laughing about this tomorrow.<eos> This is a great party.<eos> Alex... She's, um... She's lucky to have you as a friend.<eos> You're nice.<eos> Um, I was thinking maybe later next week, I could take you out to dinner to say thank you.
- Shit.<eos> Scotty.<eos> Look at you.<eos> - Look at you.<eos> Goddamn. It's good to see you.
Cara.<eos> Cara Coakley, you motherfucker.<eos> Help! Somebody help me!<eos> Coffee?<eos> I'd say it's good to see you again, but I feel sick just being this close.
- Lieutenant Pleasant.<eos> Don't you dare use the informal with me, you fucking degenerate.<eos> You're an everlasting disgrace to this department, and if Officer Barnett wasn't here, I would tune you up myself on general principle.<eos> Let me ask you something.<eos> Did Manny Vassey or any of his animals visit you inside?
Well, he had a good run.<eos> Junior can steer things now.<eos> Nothin' to do with me.<eos> - Clean slate, huh? - Oh, yeah.<eos> Well, I hate to break it to you, but you're on the hook here, Joey.
I think I'm gonna skip this one.<eos> Do you think you might wanna get together again?<eos> Like I said, everyone's gone now, and...<eos> I like you.<eos> You know, if you want, I could set you up with Toni.
We're not gonna do things like this.<eos> I'm telling you right now.<eos> - I'm doing everything I can!<eos> - All right, okay.<eos> I wish I could believe you, Joe, but you make it so hard.
It was dark, and I-I-I, um--<eos> If you knew...<eos> Because I know what it means to need a second chance.<eos> And I didn't know you when you did those things.<eos> I know you now.
That's all it is.<eos> In prison, uh, there was a chaplain.<eos> Chaplain Morris.<eos> And he sat with me for-- for fuckin' years.<eos> I'm tellin' ya, if someone tells you for that long that you can be forgiven...
We don't have to do this.<eos> It wasn't me.<eos> - All right, come on. - No. No!<eos> Who the fuck is this?<eos> I'll kill you, Junior!
No, no, you can't come down here today.<eos> Why?<eos> Because my kids are working on the set, that's why.<eos> What if word got back to my wife?<eos> I'll call you back.
- How to help you, Mr. Shannon.<eos> Now I know why I've come here.<eos> So you can meet someone who knows how to light a match in the wind?<eos> What? !<eos> There's a lady here to see you.
Pablo.<eos> Mother not so good.<eos> Pablo, how is your mother, dear?<eos> Dave.<eos> How lovely to see you again after all these years.
Sir, Bette Davis is here.<eos> She's demanding to see you.<eos> Shit.<eos> I know what you're doing, Jack, giving Crawford all my roles to control me, make me insecure.<eos> You said you were offended that I offered it to you.
Oh, she's going to win all the awards this year.<eos> Hedda.<eos> Are you two gals really getting along together?<eos> Come on, you can tell Hedda.<eos> Hedda, we told you before, we're getting on like a house on fire.
But they're burning up the screen, Jack.<eos> You should have paired them years ago.<eos> No, thanks.<eos> Two world wars were enough.<eos> But there's something I want to talk to you about, Bobby.
It's not just about morale, it's also about respect... I've lost both.<eos> Ever since I fired that tomato who was playing the neighbor girl, the whole crew knows that I was pushed into it.<eos> The whole crew knows Crawford and Davis are running the show...<eos> they double-teamed me.<eos> I'm telling you, Harriet, Jack Palance and Lee Marvin would have never pulled this shit.
I'll leave it up to you to spruce up the adjectives.<eos> Oh, I think you've got me confused with Adela Rogers St. Johns.<eos> I came here for red meat, not pabulum.<eos> No one wants to read about how those two battle-axes make nice with each other.<eos> Well, what can I tell you, Hedda?
You know, there's such a thing as alchemy, Bette.<eos> You don't mess with alchemy.<eos> My advice, you just keep doing what you're doing.<eos> Muscle out the next few weeks.<eos> Stay in your own lane, because that road is gonna get you to your next Oscar.
He should know whose carcass it is he's been handling, and just how many others in this town could identify it in the dark.<eos> That column has already been written.<eos> "Joan Crawford's Early, Tawdry Years."<eos> And it's been locked away in my desk drawer since 1946, the last time you went to Louella behind my back.<eos> Oh, I told you then, Hedda, I didn't go to Louella about my divorce from Philip.
You can't do that.<eos> Watch me.<eos> Christ, tonight I see you posing and laughing in front of the grips like a streetwalker.<eos> You're jealous.<eos> I'd smack you across the face for that if your braces hadn't cost a fortune.
They moved aside with class after their spin on the carousel was over, and that's something you refuse to do.<eos> And now look at you.<eos> You're single, lonely and doing this ridiculous role because you can't live without being in the spotlight.<eos> Well, guess what?<eos> Nobody wants you anymore.
And now look at you.<eos> You're single, lonely and doing this ridiculous role because you can't live without being in the spotlight.<eos> Well, guess what?<eos> Nobody wants you anymore.<eos> Nobody's watching you anymore.
Things that you can take apart<eos> - and then put back together again.<eos> - Mm.<eos> It's a big world, Alex, and it just got a little bit bigger.<eos> Remind me to punch you even harder than I usually do, please.
The police will arrest you, and I'm sorry, but I will be pressing charges.<eos> I told you there would be consequences.<eos> But I have to believe that you'll face those consequences and you'll come out the other side a better man.<eos> I know it's hard to see right now, but, Jimmy, this is an opportunity.<eos> That's why I'm doing this. Not to punish you. To show you -- truly show you -- that you have to make a change before it's too late.
You'll find your path.<eos> And when you're ready, I will be there to help you walk that path.<eos> Here's what's gonna happen.<eos> One day, you're gonna get sick...<eos> Again. One of your employees is gonna find you curled up in that space blanket, take you to the hospital, hook you up to those machines that beep and whir and...
Nothing. Just family trouble.<eos> You're married?<eos> No. Disagreement with my brother. Here.<eos> That hardass? I don't blame ya.<eos> So who you got representing you?
Sign here. Moron.<eos> 'Course, i knew that when you left that sa-weet Davis main gig.<eos> This way.<eos> Hey, speaking of...<eos> They, uh, still trying to replace you over there?
Run your hands through your hair, please.<eos> C'mon. Don't you wanna throw the book at me for old times' sake? Mm.<eos> Mmm, I'll see if I can work some magic...<eos> But those decisions are really above my paygrade.<eos> Oh, yeah? When did they start paying you? Right this way.
You and I have wheeled and dealed together too many times.<eos> There was no way the boss was letting me run that one.<eos> It's not ericsen, is it?<eos> The whole Albuquerque office is out.<eos> We all know you, Jimmy.
Sure. I'm making lasagna.<eos> There'll be plenty.<eos> Well, that's very sweet, but I don't want to put you out.<eos> Pop-pop, come over!<eos> There's someone here who wants to see you.
It's open!<eos> Rebecca.<eos> -Chuck.<eos> -You look lovely.<eos> - Oh, it's so good to see you.
I'm the only person who can adequately explain the context of that tape.<eos> Otherwise, the defense'll tear it to shreds.<eos> It's already a solid case.<eos> We have Jimmy's statement from the pre-prosecution diversion. There's my testimony and the private eye's.<eos> Maybe there's no need to put you through the wringer like this.
Mr. chairman, I'm sorry. Um, might I have a moment, uh, to get a breath?<eos> Oh, of course, Mr. mcgill.<eos> Uh, folks, let's call this 15.<eos> Everybody, please be back and ready to go on the hour.<eos> -Chuck. It's good to see you.
Oh, yeah?<eos> What'd you expect?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Not her.<eos> You know, she's gonna hate you when this is over.
How did you know it would work?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> How did you know your "provocation" would work?<eos> Why'd you think a bunch of shiny plastic would make me say anything?<eos> Isn't it because you knew that it was precisely the thing that would worry me so much that I'd say anything to talk you down?
To rattle me.<eos> He knows I still have a... Lot of, feeling for my ex-wife.<eos> He's hoping this will break me down.<eos> Split me apart at the seams, like a murderer confessing on an episode of "Perry Mason."<eos> Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, Jimmy.
God, Jimmy.<eos> Don't you know by now this is real?<eos> I feel this.<eos> It's a physical response to stimuli. It's not a quirk.<eos> What do I have to do to prove it to you?
We'll increase our loan numbers.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Can we review these fixed mortgage rates?<eos> 'Cause that's... definitely an area we're gonna need to focus... - ... our attention... unprofessional.<eos> I didn't mean to speak to you that way.
I didn't mean to speak to you that way.<eos> Kim. Don't worry. It's not a problem.<eos> At all.<eos> No, I'm sorry.<eos> There's no excuse for talking to you like that.
We're gonna sell him a worthless credit card for 5,000 bucks.<eos> Here's what you do.<eos> Make eye contact with him.<eos> That's all it'll take for him to think you're interested.<eos> I'll act good and drunk, and he'll think I'm a loser and try to steal you away.
Chuck, there's more to life than this.<eos> That day is far in the future, Howard. And I don't appreciate the suggestion.<eos> What if it's not a suggestion?<eos> Meaning?<eos> Meaning, if enough people tell you that you're drunk, maybe it's time to sit down.
Goddamit, Chuck.<eos> You're suing Hamlin, Hamlin, McGill?<eos> Come on in, Howard.<eos> You turned the lights on.<eos> I told you...
I did everything in my power to defend my client.<eos> Oh, is that what you're calling it?<eos> That's the job, Howard.<eos> And by the way, it was all very convenient for you to ignore Chuck's illness when it suited you.<eos> So, I take you out of the mail room, put you through law school, mentor you, and then when you leave and stab me in the back, that's my fault?
No judgments, all right?<eos> Man's gotta make a living.<eos> I'm just saying the way you make yours... rhymes with "mug mealer." Yeah.<eos> What are you... a narc?<eos> I'm the guy who's gonna get you out of here - and let you keep your hours.
She's got the right amount of teenage sass.<eos> - She is not an actress.<eos> - Well, look who her mother is, for Christ sake.<eos> The apple can't fall that far from the tree.<eos> Now you say she doesn't understand you, doesn't appreciate how hard you work for her.
I'm too old to even think about awards.<eos> There, you see that?<eos> Even that was almost convincing.<eos> I mean it, Lucille.<eos> I'm going to support this picture even if it means supporting you, too.
That's certainly ungracious, yes, and dismissive of Miss Judy Holliday's winsome performance.<eos> She won by default!<eos> That bitch Anne Baxter, she pushed her way into my category and we split the vote.<eos> That's why she won.<eos> Well, need I remind you that, unlike Eve, you and I share equal billing on this.
- I'm sorry.<eos> Does she have to stand there?<eos> She's not the director.<eos> Why is she standing there?<eos> If I were the director, I'd tell you to do it again and again until it was convincing.
I hate keeping secrets.<eos> I hate lying.<eos> Lying is what we do for a living, kid.<eos> Jack, I know it's a little rough around the edges, but this short editing schedule you've got me on is pretty brutal.<eos> I'll tell you what's brutal, I got 400 theaters booked already.
No, I don't believe you.<eos> The proclaimed alliance back in Los Angeles, you never had any intention of honoring.<eos> That is not true.<eos> Christ, what a fool I was to sign up for this picture.<eos> And a bigger fool to think I could ever trust you.
I guess that explains my 11 Oscar nominations.<eos> The Academy doesn't reward you for your talent, for Christ's sakes, Bette.<eos> They reward you because they see how hard you sweat.<eos> They don't see the character, they see the acting.<eos> And they don't see you at all because of all your glamour makeup.
And, as a result of my convalescence, Charlotte is sure to be a much better picture once I recover.<eos> Well, Bob, what a lovely surprise.<eos> Mamacita, turn that off.<eos> Uh, c-could you give us a few moments, please?<eos> Seeing you is a tonic.
I've been busy trying to keep a train on track.<eos> Well, I'm touched you could find a spare moment.<eos> I have nothing but spare moments.<eos> I've run out of material to shoot.<eos> If I don't roll cameras on you tomorrow morning, the studio's threatening to close us down.
I can't afford another bomb.<eos> If Charlotte doesn't work, I'm back making crap TV.<eos> So I suggest you put down your fucking script and pick up your fucking contract and give that a close fucking read.<eos> Tomorrow morning, 7:00 a.m., and not a minute later.<eos> Oh, Jake, how great to see you.
So I suggest you put down your fucking script and pick up your fucking contract and give that a close fucking read.<eos> Tomorrow morning, 7:00 a.m., and not a minute later.<eos> Oh, Jake, how great to see you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Oh, Sonny, nice to see you again.
Are you having second thoughts about marrying Jeremy?<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> I just don't see why we have to make such a big production out of the wedding.<eos> Well, I'll tell you why.
Well, I'll tell you why.<eos> A wedding is a big, special party because everything after that is hard work and repetition.<eos> It's work to keep a house.<eos> It's work to fix him the same goddamn glass of scotch every night and feign interest while he rants about his boss.<eos> It's work to tolerate his forgetting to ask you about your day, and your feelings, and your thoughts.
undignified?<eos> Faking sick?<eos> Let me tell you something.<eos> At a certain point, a woman becomes invisible.<eos> You get fat or old... people don't even see you anymore.
- Who is?<eos> - Matias Solomon.<eos> There he is, in the flesh.<eos> One of my best men.<eos> I trusted you to work with him, and you shot him and left him for dead.
Country code is England.<eos> Yes, fine!<eos> No.<eos> I'm alive.<eos> I don't know who they were, but they were asking about you.
I made finding you my life's work.<eos> And that search... that quest raised questions about your mother.<eos> How did she come into my life and why?<eos> She had been using me and my company from the beginning.<eos> And when I confronted her about that, she used my obsession with you to make it appear as if I was crazy.
Your disappearance 30 years ago, her trying to have me declared incompetent, downing the jet to have me killed.<eos> She had me declared legally dead today.<eos> Scottie Hargrave is now in charge of a global intelligence gathering operation.<eos> And she's gonna use that network for the benefit of... something terrible.<eos> I didn't know if I would ever find you, and if I did, I didn't know who you would be.
You apologized.<eos> That's acknowledgment, not talk.<eos> Do you want to talk about it?<eos> No, 'cause there's nothing to talk about.<eos> 'Cause if we did talk about it, I'd probably end up taking that ice pick and stabbing you with it.
Good.<eos> Can't afford to have Howard upend everything we've been working on.<eos> Looking for a refill?<eos> Nah, I'm trying to kick it.<eos> I'm here to sell you on something.
He's fine, by the way.<eos> I'm sure he'd love to see you.<eos> - Why don't I go tell him you're here?<eos> - I love you, buddy.<eos> If you don't tell me Whitehall's location and the code in the next five seconds... I will shoot you with a tranq dart in the face.
Justice.<eos> I loved her once.<eos> In some ways, I still do.<eos> I know how difficult this is, but it's the right thing to do.<eos> I want to thank you for helping me do it.
Couldn't get to her files.<eos> She was too smart.<eos> But you... you actually thought I cared.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Last thing anyone's ever gonna say to you is,
- Oh, fantasy league, huh?<eos> Sounds like my kind of fun.<eos> Mixing it up with some friends.<eos> I can bring the trash talk.<eos> You do not want me coming for you on a group e-mail.
- Of course.<eos> You're definitely our boss.<eos> And definitely not our friend.<eos> That played out differently than I thought it was going to.<eos> It's just that we barely know you.
You're definitely our boss.<eos> And definitely not our friend.<eos> That played out differently than I thought it was going to.<eos> It's just that we barely know you.<eos> But we could get to know you.
What do you need from me?<eos> Remember Beirut?<eos> Where I was your safety net in uncertain times?<eos> Yow owe me one.<eos> And do you have any idea what your asset needs to tell you so urgently?
- And his wife.<eos> He's married?<eos> Okay, I need you to stay here.<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> - Going to find out who's trying to kill you and why.
Sure.<eos> Omid Piruz, Quds Force... Iranian.<eos> Now are you going to - tell me what's going on?<eos> - Oh, Zev, please, you know you need - to stay off the grass here.<eos> - Well, I was just hoping to ask a favor of you in return.
Well, choose wisely.<eos> A study can live or die by patient selection.<eos> I just think that if you were to kind of cut it on an angle, it would kind of highlight your features better.<eos> [clears throat]<eos> Can I talk to you for a sec?
Finish it.<eos> A more supportive what?<eos> Wife?<eos> But you're not my wife, Alex.<eos> Because I asked you, and you said no.
What?<eos> Excuse me, this is a closed rehearsal.<eos> I'm sorry, I...<eos> Josie, right?<eos> I was hoping I could talk to you about some songs that I wrote?
- Can I get you anything?<eos> - A job.<eos> I can't very well have the wife of Hiram LodgLo on trial for fraud and embezzlement, balancing my books.<eos> Betty and Archie are endgame.<eos> I'm not gonna ask what you did with Veronica at Cheryl's. I'm asking you now, right now, if you love me, Archie.
Walk me to school?<eos> I needed time to process. To separate what my mom wants from what I want...<eos> I think I want.<eos> Which is?<eos> My mom says I should never speak to you again.
That's slightly suspicious, no?<eos> Are you living mannequins suggesting I had something to do with my brother's death?<eos> We're just curious.<eos> What do the police think happened?<eos> I'll tell you what I told them, which is that Jason did fall into the water.
And this is your way of trying to be friends with me again?<eos> The Pussycats are in.<eos> Oh, sorry, ladies, am I interrupting?<eos> - As a matter of fact... - No, you're not.<eos> Actually, I was about to come and find you, Cheryl.
I'm picking up an order for Andrews.<eos> Oh, you're Fred's son?<eos> You're as handsome as your father was.<eos> I'll see you at home, Mom.<eos> I'm sure Archie would happily escort you.
Cheryl?<eos> Because, you dumb cow, someone shot my brother and I think it was your crazy, tweaked-out sister.<eos> Get out of my house.<eos> Not until you tell me...<eos> Cheryl, get the hell out of my house before I kill you.
A kid is dead, Archie! And you're worried about some... Some cougar?<eos> Don't call her that.<eos> Okay, she's not like that, she cares about me.<eos> Stab in the dark. I'm guessing she cares more about herself.<eos> She's the one who's telling you not to say anything, right?
Mom, I was thinking... Maybe it's time I go visit Polly.<eos> I am so proud of how you stood up to that dragoness, but honestly, Betty, why was Cheryl over here in the first place?<eos> And who else is gonna come waltzing in? Veronica?<eos> Archie?<eos> How many times are you gonna let them hurt you?
I was there.<eos> I heard the gunshot and I have to own that.<eos> - Archie, slow down.<eos> - I'm gonna do it tomorrow.<eos> If you wanna come with me, then we can figure that out. If not, I'll respect that and I'll do everything I can to keep you out of it.
I'm alone.<eos> Mom and Dad aren't here.<eos> Betty, you have to help me.<eos> Please.<eos> How did you get up here without anyone seeing you?
And I won't have my baby raised in a home that doesn't want it.<eos> Polly...<eos> Give me a few days.<eos> I'll find you someplace safe, here in Riverdale.<eos> Please, Polly, I cannot lose you again.
Of course, I was with you, and I know who you are.<eos> Those Paradise Lost kids went to death row because they wore black and they listened to Metallica.<eos> I don't wanna become a scapegoat. I'm not gonna let that happen.<eos> All the evidence against you is circumstantial.<eos> We're gonna get you out of here.
- Nothing.<eos> It's fine now.<eos> Mr. Andrews took care of it.<eos> What jacked-up crap did they accuse you of in there, huh?<eos> Those bastards trying to throw you in jail like they did your old man? Well, screw that.
Maybe that's for the best.<eos> If you don't mind, Fred.<eos> Whatever you want, FP.<eos> It's between the two of you.<eos> I'll go with you, Dad.
Betty, what do you say?<eos> Elizabeth Cooper. Mom?<eos> I need you and you.<eos> Right now.<eos> Hey, Vic, I was just getting ready to come out and walk you through the day.
I mean, Mom, at least.<eos> In that case, we'll get her there somehow.<eos> But I do not want to fight with her.<eos> You won't.<eos> The entire Cooper family will support you on this, Polly.
Help her.<eos> Otherwise, you're gonna regret it for the rest of your life.<eos> This is awesome.<eos> Moving rocks beats working out in our crappy weight room. Hey, Keller!<eos> Looking good, looking buff. We should get you on the team.
Good to see you.<eos> Right this way.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> - Good to see you.
That would be something.<eos> This is your legacy, which makes it mine, too.<eos> Polly's finally asleep.<eos> What a mess.<eos> I should've told you about my dad when I had the chance.
I don't care anymore.<eos> And I am not gonna ask again.<eos> Get out.<eos> I don't want you here when Polly gets home.<eos> I should've trusted you.
Previously on Riverdale...<eos> They're ruining our lives, and to them it's just a game.<eos> They keep score in some secret playbook.<eos> You want vengeance? I'm with you.
I'll check in.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Veronica, this is Paul Sowerberry, your father's attorney.<eos> He's here to prep us for our statements and help at your dad's hearing.<eos> Except, I told you, Mom, I'm not giving one.
It'll humanize him. Which could mean a lesser sentence.<eos> If you don't make a statement, well, that's problematic and damaging.<eos> I've already told her all of this.<eos> Well, Dad made his bed. And I'm late for school.<eos> Veronica, there's something we need to talk to you about.
And I read your, uh...<eos> Manuscript?<eos> - You did? - Yeah.<eos> - Really?<eos> - I asked you for it, didn't I?
And whether or not he hired FP to kill Jason.<eos> What exactly are you saying, Veronica?<eos> I'm saying, if you want to go after Jughead's dad, Mrs. Cooper, I'm in.<eos> Sorry to interrupt, but I have an announcement to make.<eos> One that tangentially involves you, Betty.
'Cause Archie asked me to sing with him, and we're thinking about doing some upbeat covers.<eos> We are?<eos> Aren't we?<eos> Not that I'm complaining, Ronnie, but why the change of heart?<eos> Because I'm hoping you'll say yes to the favor I'm about to ask you.
Jughead can never find out.<eos> And neither can Betty.<eos> Oh, Pollikins, it's much more fun being friends than mortal enemies.<eos> And I'm glad we're honoring Jay-Jay's legacy together.<eos> This color totally pops on you.
I...<eos> I thought the ring had been lost...<eos> Nothing's lost forever.<eos> Everything comes back.<eos> Now. Unless you have any more questions, I'll leave you to finish getting ready for the dance.
The mullah's wife - is freaking out.<eos> - Sounded like you guys - had contact.<eos> - No, no, we're all good here.<eos> And we got Nailer on overwatch. Don't sweat it.<eos> Why don't you roll in through the south side of town, - and I'll flag you down.
It wasn't logged into Evidence.<eos> I mean, there might be something on his phone that's not on his computer.<eos> He probably dropped it when he was attacked, and we don't know where that was.<eos> - Find My Phone. - Okay?<eos> That's the thing on the computer that tells you where your phone is.
- Hmm?<eos> - Be careful.<eos> Mm?<eos> Marcus...<eos> I see the way he looks at you.
Look at me, Mellie.<eos> Look at me.<eos> I had nothing to do with Frankie's death.<eos> Absolutely... nothing.<eos> And despite everything Olivia's telling you right now, at some point along the way here, you're gonna realize I'm telling you the truth, and then you're gonna feel terrible about the chaos you will have helped create in this country.
Hey, should I call your dad?<eos> You know, permission and all that.<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> Who's gonna walk you down the aisle?
- You know that.<eos> - [Laughs]<eos> You and I go back!<eos> - Mm.<eos> - I respect you.
♪<eos> [ Camera shutter clicking]<eos> Liv.<eos> That I'm really glad we got to talk.<eos> It was really good seeing you, Liv.
My job.<eos> I am protecting this office.<eos> No, you're destroying it.<eos> And if you think a false confession is where this ends, then you are sorely mistaken.<eos> Believe me when I tell you Cyrus will go to prison and Mellie will become our next president.
Listen, what if there's a chance I could still have the presidency now?<eos> ♪<eos> I miss you.<eos> What?<eos> You said no one ever chooses you.
So I did what I had to do.<eos> I did my job!<eos> And I made the choice for you.<eos> [Sighs]<eos> You said you wanted the Oval, Mellie, and it was my job to get it for you.
What you did is vile!<eos> Inexcusable!<eos> Frankie, please.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> No, what you don't understand is the moment I'm elected President of the United States, my first order of business will be to put you in the coldest jail cell possible.
All right, come on.<eos> Let's talk about this seriously.<eos> It's close enough to Brown that you can even see your sister on the weekends.<eos> Yeah, you can see Steph.<eos> Stephanie said that she would look into an internship for you through her journalism program.
The point is that we can do this.<eos> What?<eos> Do you know what that is?<eos> I don't know, why?<eos> It's an alarm that I was making for my room, but I was hoping if I handed it to you... you'd start playing with it and I could probably use it to prove a point.
When I know more, you'll know more.<eos> More what?<eos> Reasons to kick out the poor kids?<eos> It's not about that.<eos> I needed to talk to you.
I'm sorry.<eos> Anyway, um...<eos> I, uh, saw on your schedule that you have practice after school, so I was just hoping to catch you.<eos> You know my schedule?<eos> Well, I wanted to speak to you about Jason and Alice...
So I...<eos> We... we can't.<eos> Hey, there's your girlfriend.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Not used to seeing you at these things.
And, by the way, what about the quarters?<eos> How are we gonna sell them?<eos> Have you thought about that?<eos> I'm still working on that part.<eos> I don't know how you expect people to trust you when you haven't even thought things through.
And tell them you already signed up and it's too late to bail, especially with all the work you did.<eos> Then they'd have to help you finish it.<eos> You know, that's not the worst idea.<eos> Important decisions should not be left to the Jason Hodges of the world.<eos> Who knows, they'll probably thank you for it.
Deal.<eos> - You going?<eos> - You look nice.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> I just wanted to tell you, I know I haven't been very helpful... with everything.
I thought it was more than a project, but they were just using me.<eos> Like you said.<eos> I don't know about that.<eos> It seems like he does actually like you for some reason.<eos> I mean, like, he's staring at you. Like, right now.
Not right now.<eos> - Bye, guys.<eos> - Bye.<eos> See you.<eos> So... is your boyfriend coming to pick you up?
- Bye.<eos> See you.<eos> So... is your boyfriend coming to pick you up?<eos> No, that's over.<eos> I'm really sorry I let him talk to you like that.
Put it down.<eos> That your house?<eos> Go inside.<eos> Get... get...<eos> A first-aid kit or some bandages. Or anything like that, and bring it to me, But don't let anybody see you.
I bet he did.<eos> Apparently he had the motel address. With his things.<eos> I know.<eos> I know; This is exactly what I mean, mother... Why I'm upset... because you just decide things are best.<eos> When I'm really not sure you know what's best at all. So I should've just let jim blackwell kill you?
Forget about all this, okay?<eos> Don't ever do that to me again.<eos> I won't.<eos> Are you coming?<eos> Right behind you.
Nothing, just...<eos> I just want to get rid of a car, chick.<eos> Well, that seems like an unnecessarily elaborate way. To just get rid of a car.<eos> Well, that's... What I'm going to be doing.<eos> And that's all I'm going to tell you, so...
You do what you're gonna do.<eos> I'm gonna do what I want to do.<eos> You're not doing anything, mother... Not about her.<eos> Promise me.<eos> I promise that I will always protect you.
What happened to you?<eos> May I come in?<eos> I'm not trying to bogart the cake-making.<eos> It's just all happening here in this bowl.<eos> No, I'm having fun watching you.
I couldn't bring myself to tell you the horrible truth, which is that sh-she committed suicide.<eos> No... that is not what happened.<eos> I know her, and she wouldn't do that.<eos> Hey, Sheriff.<eos> I'm comin' for you when you least expect it, so don't get too cozy up at that house all by yourself.
Last time, you pointed here.<eos> I'm sorry, Sheriff, but I just was not exactly myself that night.<eos> You say you drove past Falls Lake that night.<eos> We pulled two bodies from the lake that night...<eos> Jim Blackwell, as I told you, and an unidentified female.
So what?<eos> He abandoned you.<eos> He's my brother.<eos> I'm the only one that you have.<eos> I'm the only one who's gonna protect you.
You're right.<eos> I can't.<eos> Not with you here.<eos> Forgive me.<eos> Okay. Now, I'm gonna wake you up when things are safe again, okay?
- Yeah, standard procedure would mean filing formal charges, but... I see that hasn't happened yet.<eos> Someone got you on a fishing expedition, Billy.<eos> You could use a win.<eos> I heard the sheriff's trimming the fat.<eos> - Nice to see you, too, Julia.
What do I need to know about him?<eos> He has another side to him.<eos> I don't know what you'd call it.<eos> Maybe multiple personalities.<eos> I'm the only one who's gonna protect you.
I need the handcuffs off.<eos> He's got documents to sign.<eos> I'll be right outside.<eos> What a relief.<eos> Are they treating you all right?
I agree.<eos> You believe me?<eos> I agree with your approach.<eos> There are no light sentences when it comes to serial homicide.<eos> But if you plead guilty, the best we can hope for is to keep you alive.
Previously on Beyond.<eos> Nothing will distract me from bringing you home.
You know, it...<eos> What mattered was the experience.<eos> You know? The... time you spent with one another out on the dock.<eos> I was sent here.<eos> To find you.
I was sent here.<eos> To find you.<eos> You what?<eos> By a guy named Isaac Frost.<eos> He's the leader of this group called Hollow Sky and he wants to meet with you.
Arthur repudiated everything.<eos> But the whole idea of using science and technology to reach the afterlife,<eos> Dr. Frost was simply taking Arthur's idea to the next level.<eos> Oh, it was Arthur's idea?<eos> Didn't your grandpa tell you?
We aren't finished with our lesson.<eos> Please, Mom.<eos> Can I stay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Just promise me that Aunt Maddie will have you home before dark.
Well, he's a good looking boy.<eos> But I meet a lot of people.<eos> I've got a transit pass.<eos> Then show me.<eos> You know, what's to stop me from just killing you and keeping the pass?
Where have you been for the last year?<eos> Your son would've died on the streets if it wasn't for me.<eos> So I'd like to hear a little goddamn gratitude.<eos> And then maybe we can make a deal.<eos> If I get to see my boy, I'd be grateful to you for the rest of my life.
- I tried to run away.<eos> Solomon put me on the chain.<eos> I learned.<eos> What else did he do to you?<eos> I came to take you home, Charlie.
Keep moving.<eos> Come on, keep moving.<eos> Hey. Do you want to come eat with my friends?<eos> Sure.<eos> This is the guy I was telling you about.
Lookit, lookit.<eos> What's up, man?<eos> Did you lose another kid?<eos> I'm here to see Solomon.<eos> Get your ass out of here before I stab you again.
- Grandpa.<eos> Don't cancel...yes... - How are you?<eos> - Fit and fine.<eos> Tara.<eos> - I'll just call you back.
I went to Ahmadabad...with my office colleagues.<eos> When did you arrive?<eos> But your office colleagues returned yesterday.<eos> And you...where were you?<eos> I just told you, Ahmadabad.
So...<eos> - So?<eos> Should I call mom tomorrow.<eos> What for?<eos> So she can meet you.
So we can come there.<eos> Where are you?<eos> - On the way.<eos> Mumbai?<eos> - We're coming to meet you.
- Just wait there, I am coming.<eos> Where are you?<eos> - Just keep walking straight.<eos> - You sound so sexy in that angry tone!<eos> Just let me get my hands on you... I will shoot you.
So when your private plane came to pick me up, I obliged.<eos> You weren't here either.<eos> So I thought I'll do some sightseeing in Kanpur.<eos> What did she say?<eos> She wanted to know why I have been chasing you around.
Did he take your call?<eos> Has anyone taken your call?<eos> Here's what I know.<eos> I know that you are absolutely screwed right now.<eos> I know the press is ready to hang you, and without someone in your corner, you will never be President.
America?<eos> I'm keeping it.<eos> It's not safe with you.<eos> "For the good of the country."<eos> I'll tell you what's good for the country, Fitz...
I just want to talk.<eos> Why didn't you say so?<eos> In that case...<eos> Eyes! Elbow!<eos> Hey, hey! I'm not here to hurt you.
Ever.<eos> I used you.<eos> You loved me... and I used you.<eos> Open up.<eos> This is a much less efficient way of killing you.
Is Henry coming?<eos> - In a minute.<eos> - Oh. Where's he been lately?<eos> Just, uh, busy with school.<eos> I don't want to embarrass you or anything, but I just-- I just wanted to say, it was tough for Matthew when he started spending more time here, and you guys made it a lot easier, so...
When the Long Night comes again, I need to be ready.<eos> How do you know all this?<eos> The Three-Eyed Raven taught me.<eos> I thought you were the Three-Eyed Raven.<eos> I told you it's difficult to explain.
I don't think you want people to see how you look swinging that thing yet.<eos> Today might be the day I kill you by accident.<eos> Oh, you won't be swinging it at me.<eos> I'll leave you to it.<eos> I needed to see you.
Abandoned the family home, completely unsentimental.<eos> Father would have been proud.<eos> - Don't talk about Father.<eos> - Listen to me...<eos> I once told Bronn that if I ever saw you again, I'd cut you in half.
Father would have been proud.<eos> - Don't talk about Father.<eos> - Listen to me...<eos> I once told Bronn that if I ever saw you again, I'd cut you in half.<eos> It'll take you a while with a sparring sword.
I... I don't.<eos> And Daenerys doesn't.<eos> Not right now, anyway.<eos> She has a more important request.<eos> I wasn't sure I'd find you.
But this... this I know.<eos> Keep your father's name to yourself.<eos> Situation's complicated enough already.<eos> Well, who should I say I am?<eos> I told you, Clovis, if we don't get out of here soon,
- You know her?<eos> - You're with Brienne of fucking Tarth?<eos> Well, not with her yet.<eos> But I see the way she looks at me.<eos> How does she look at you?
- You're with Brienne of fucking Tarth?<eos> Well, not with her yet.<eos> But I see the way she looks at me.<eos> How does she look at you?<eos> Like she wants to carve you up and eat your liver?
Stop!<eos> Leon.<eos> With everything that's going on, you just sit here and feel sorry for yourself.<eos> And you?<eos> You're letting a grudge get the better of you.
Who is this?<eos> - Can I talk to Papa? Please.<eos> Where's Patricio?<eos> Put my husband on the phone right--<eos> There's a reason he gave that to you before he died.
Yep.<eos> He transferred out after the season.<eos> Is he still at Wisconsin?<eos> Michigan.<eos> Anyway, they want you.
Alice, I don't know, but... I'm better because of him.<eos> Not churchbetter, but betterbetter.<eos> That's probably true.<eos> He made you think about things that kids don't think about here.<eos> Probably helped prepare you for... Whatever comes.
You need me, Elizabeth.<eos> Not for this.<eos> I'm making you stay.<eos> And it just keeps getting worse for you.<eos> I don't want to see you like this anymore.
Sure you don't want to grab a booth?<eos> Haven't seen the family for quite a bit.<eos> Oh, we can't today, but we owe you a visit.<eos> You keep that change.<eos> God bless you, darling.
Patricia.<eos> Hello, John.<eos> How are you holding up?<eos> I needed to do something.<eos> I want to talk to you.
All right, nothing.<eos> Will you help me find him?<eos> Of course I will.<eos> Catch anything?<eos> You gotta stay where Mrs. Giles can see you. Okay?
Come here.<eos> I love you, Firefly.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> All right, promise to behave.<eos> Stay where she can see you.
Okay.<eos> I didn't get a chance to administer morphine because our kit's in the truck, and his pulse is racing like a jackhammer.<eos> He's going into shock.<eos> We need to get him to a trauma surgeon, right now.<eos> Why are these guys after you?
Live for this.<eos> Now, I gotta go see about my partner.<eos> Hey, jarhead.<eos> You listening?<eos> We got your girl, and she's got something she has to tell you.
No, no, no.<eos> You're a paramedic.<eos> It's your job.<eos> Do what's right.<eos> Ahhh! I'm gonna kill you like I killed your bitch partner.
I've never seen anything like it in my life.<eos> I suppose it's understandable.<eos> You just came here to tell me that?<eos> Right. No, thank you.<eos> I came here to tell you that Abby says you don't have to worry about the death penalty.
How do you know if somebody's a client or a friend?<eos> Like a girl somebody?<eos> Well, not necessarily.<eos> So, a girl.<eos> How does she look at you?
You shouldn't have seen this.<eos> Elizabeth shouldn't have given you this.<eos> I made her.<eos> Some people are smart enough to be afraid of me, you know.<eos> I wanted to know what the hell her plan was, how she was planning to get you out of here.
Our side.<eos> There is no our side, Cyrus.<eos> Michael, please.<eos> Did Tom ever see the letters?<eos> Did she ever show them to him before she gave them to you?
Sure.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> If I had known the facts, I never would have let it get this far.<eos> Cyrus, Tom Larsen recanted.<eos> He said you had nothing to do with him killing Frankie, and the only reason he ever said that you were involved is because he was angry and wanted to hurt you.
Do it right.<eos> Stop being a monster and be a man.<eos> Be a man you can be proud of, Cy.<eos> I'm... I'm going to die in here.<eos> I will always be your friend, but I will not speak to you again.
- The sun'll be back tomorrow.<eos> This place is so fancy.<eos> This butter is in the shape of a shell.<eos> I don't know how they did it, but gotta say, I'm impressed.<eos> Good to see you.
This place is so fancy.<eos> This butter is in the shape of a shell.<eos> I don't know how they did it, but gotta say, I'm impressed.<eos> Good to see you.<eos> Yeah. Good to see you, Dad.
Holden, get in the car!<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - It's me, Willa.<eos> I can't take you home.<eos> That's the first place they'll look for you.
Diane, let it go.<eos> Did all that really happen outside the... the bar?<eos> What, you think I made it up?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Truth is I don't know you well enough to know if that's something you'd make up.
I don't know if anyone's gonna blame you.<eos> Well, except, you know...<eos> Right.<eos> You got a second?<eos> There's something I want to show you.
Couple of replacement parts, some man hours.<eos> If anybody can fix it, it's you, Holden.<eos> You saved all this?<eos> Of course I did.<eos> I cannot count the many times I had to pull you away from that thing just to get you to eat.
You're sneaking.<eos> - I'm not sneaking, I...<eos> - I get it.<eos> Mom runs this place like Guantanamo.<eos> A little rebellion now and then could be good for you.
So she's resting comfortably now.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Can you believe this?<eos> - Police car? - Yeah.<eos> You don't remember being in it when the police officer drove you?
This is gonna be the longest four hours ever.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Tell me about it.<eos> Sweetie, I think I'm gonna have<eos> - Scarlett take you home, okay? - No!
Baby, you got a concert tomorrow.<eos> I want you to get some sleep.<eos> I wanna be here when she wakes up.<eos> Honey, your mom won't even remember waking up.<eos> I promise I'll get you back here in the morning, I will.
And they send you their love.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - Okay, let's wrap it up.<eos> This young lady needs to get some rest.<eos> I'll check on you first thing in the morning.
Hey, did Deacon tell you about the song we're gonna write?<eos> The song?<eos> - I'll tell you about it later.<eos> - You gotta get your guitar, honey.<eos> I'm not leaving you to go get some guitar.
- Mom's out of surgery.<eos> - Well, how did it go?<eos> Good, I guess.<eos> He and Daphne are gonna spend the night there.<eos> Well, I can take you back.
Well, I did tell you that I might not make it.<eos> All right, just answer me this, okay?<eos> Is he so good in bed you had to spend the whole frickin' day with him?<eos> I'm gonna go get Daphne's toothbrush.<eos> And I'll meet you in the car.
Daphne had a pretty rough spell earlier.<eos> But I think she's okay now.<eos> You realize I'm kind of screwed here.<eos> How so?<eos> If I put foot down and tell you not to see him, you'll just resent me.
He's completely charming in a blowhard kind of way.<eos> I mean, I'd date him if I wasn't already in love with somebody.<eos> Please keep your voice down.<eos> What am I supposed to do, Scarlett, to win your trust back?<eos> Do I follow you around like a puppy?
My mom.<eos> She was helping me with our song.<eos> - Her mom was helping her with...<eos> - Yes! Yes, Scarlett.<eos> I'm telling you, it was spooky.
- I'd like to get to know him better.<eos> - Mm. But then Gunnar looks so miserable.<eos> And says things like he's going to fight for me.<eos> And I'm lost all over again.<eos> Just 'cause he's miserable and he says he's gonna fight for you doesn't mean he's the one for you.
Because we wanna watch a movie.<eos> - No you can't stay here, honey.<eos> - Why not?<eos> Because your sister's not here and you don't have a babysitter.<eos> I told you you're going.
Thank you.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> We were all pretty young back then, especially you.<eos> Yeah, well, I sure as hell ain't now.<eos> Good to see you back.
Oh, my God!<eos> I'm sorry, I'm sorry.<eos> Daphne, think fast!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Hey, Daph, can I talk to you a sec?
- I know, I know.<eos> The whole situation is so messed up.<eos> Hey, thanks for always being there for me, Ruby.<eos> Hey, you know I always will be.<eos> I'll leave you to it.
During the day.<eos> It turns out I'm just less fine at night.<eos> You snore.<eos> You talk in your sleep.<eos> Last night you kept saying, "Let's get you out of that skin."
It turns out I'm just less fine at night.<eos> You snore.<eos> You talk in your sleep.<eos> Last night you kept saying, "Let's get you out of that skin."<eos> Must have freaked you out, huh?
Do you want me to do stuff to you?<eos> Oh, stop asking me that!<eos> I don't hear a "no."<eos> Oh, fucking hell, Frankie!<eos> Are you gonna make me physically remove you from this room?
You think coming out to her is going to make you feel better?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> When has that woman ever made you feel better about anything?<eos> Does she still refer to me as "the loud, tall Jew at the law firm"?<eos> Only to distinguish you from the "slender, black one."
Yes, I do.<eos> When has that woman ever made you feel better about anything?<eos> Does she still refer to me as "the loud, tall Jew at the law firm"?<eos> Only to distinguish you from the "slender, black one."<eos> She's never going to give you what you want.
Just wanting to know how it went, and hoping you're doing all right.<eos> Let me know...<eos> Oh, hang on. The other line is ringing.<eos> Hey, hang on one second. I'm on the other line.<eos> I'll call you back.
Oh, thank heavens you're back!<eos> Yes, I flew back in a plane to the airport.<eos> I know how planes work.<eos> Do you know how picking people up from the airport works?<eos> I was supposed to pick you up.
Are we back in graduate school again?<eos> We are a long way from graduate school.<eos> Eli.<eos> Yes?<eos> It's so good to see you.
Eli.<eos> Yes?<eos> It's so good to see you.<eos> How long are you in town?<eos> Well, to be honest, this lecture wasn't my only reason for reaching out to you.
That had to have been someone else, someone else I want to forget entirely.<eos> I'm sorry I mistrusted you.<eos> Sandra, all of this...<eos> All of this is over now.<eos> I told you, it's been taken care of.
Sandra, all of this...<eos> All of this is over now.<eos> I told you, it's been taken care of.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> It means I'm protecting you.
They are electing Mellie Grant and Jake Ballard.<eos> This is not a life sentence.<eos> Think...<eos> This is an opportunity.<eos> If she wanted to keep you as a puppet, she's made a mistake.
A minor player in our history book.<eos> She's handing you the keys to this beautiful country, and she doesn't even see it.<eos> You will be on the front line.<eos> You will be the player.<eos> No one's gonna run you.
Yes, ma'am.<eos> Okay, let's get this over with, because I am late for getting away from you.<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> What do I want from you?<eos> I want you to stop acting like me turning you into a world leader makes me a villain.
There has to be some higher purpose.<eos> This is my shot, Jake, to run a clean election, to do this right, to make a president honestly.<eos> This is my chance at redemption for Defiance.<eos> So I have to win.<eos> There has to be a reason, or else why did I do this to you?
No!<eos> No, I can't!<eos> You don't talk to me, but you talk to her.<eos> You tell her... everything.<eos> It's like she knows you. She knows everything about you.
- We're family.<eos> - Yeah, exactly.<eos> But I'm your wife, Jake. I am your family now.<eos> We are a team.<eos> I want to know you.
I bet it's good. Worth its weight in gold. But I'm not sure how tight it can actually still be, what with all the miles you must've put on that thing by now.<eos> I'm gonna keep telling myself that you're still drunk. And I'm gonna keep telling myself that my husband's whore is not seriously in my face right now!<eos> Aah!<eos> Keep talking.<eos> Give me one more reason to lay you out!
You're not the only one.<eos> You know?<eos> He's seeing someone else, the scumbag.<eos> He's cheating on the both of us.<eos> Jake is not cheating on you, Vanessa, with anyone.
Jake is not cheating on you, Vanessa, with anyone.<eos> Oh, please.<eos> I was on the trail with him, day and night.<eos> He has Secret Service watching his every move.<eos> I know he is not cheating on you.
But she failed.<eos> You failed.<eos> You failed.<eos> You should've killed me when you had the chance, because whatever this is, whatever you're trying to do here,<eos> I will come after you.
Come on.<eos> - I need you.<eos> - You have me.<eos> No.<eos> I need to know you.
I can't tell you the answers to those questions.<eos> What?<eos> Why not?<eos> I can't tell you answers to those questions.<eos> There are things about my past, things I've done, things... that would scare you, things that would prevent you from ever looking at me the same way again.
There's nothing in here. It's completely empty.<eos> - What?<eos> - The room was cleaned out.<eos> It's like he knew we were coming.<eos> I'll call you back.
She had to... disappear.<eos> She no longer exists.<eos> On paper, at least.<eos> You asked who I was meeting with at the motel.<eos> I'll tell you.
Today's lesson is don't ever stay down and don't ever relax.<eos> Don't ever relax?<eos> You taught me that last week.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Looking for you!
What are you doing here?<eos> Looking for you!<eos> You're not answering your phone!<eos> I turned it off.<eos> Which is why I had to hack your geotags to track you down.
That is not why.<eos> 45 seconds.<eos> Why?<eos> - I had no other choice! - What?<eos> You're saying these people who are following you
- I had no other choice! - What?<eos> You're saying these people who are following you<eos> - forced you to do it?<eos> - I am.<eos> - Nobody forces you to do anything.
What's that supposed to mean?<eos> You know what that means.<eos> What, Becky?<eos> Meg's not Becky.<eos> Yeah, Becky wasn't Becky until she left you holding the gun that shot the President in the head.
- I wanted to ask you... about your boss, Olivia.<eos> What about her?<eos> She gets answers, right?<eos> Helps out the underdog, takes on lost causes?<eos> Look, I don't want to put you in an uncomfortable position, but we still don't know who killed Jenny.
What are you doing?<eos> Oh, that's good.<eos> You should come over, celebrate.<eos> Yeah, I have news, too.<eos> Olivia agreed to talk to you.
So do you.<eos> You have any room in the fridge?<eos> This wasn't chilled.<eos> Tell me more about your day.<eos> I already told you.
- I trusted you! - Aah!<eos> I-I-I-I have no idea who you think I am or what is going on.<eos> But please...<eos> Huck... don't do this.<eos> It was a mistake to trust you.
[Camera shutter clicking]<eos> [Doorbell ringing]<eos> - [Doorbell rings] - David: What?<eos> David, it's Abby.<eos> I need to talk to you.
Say that again?<eos> Jennifer Fields...<eos> The woman from the cabin?<eos> She's alive.<eos> You're not supposed to know yet, and I can't tell you where she is right now, but she's safe.
I can't!<eos> I can't.<eos> Give it up already.<eos> It's no use.<eos> She's here to distract you.
[Whispering] They're gonna find me.<eos> What was that?<eos> [Louder] They're gonna find me.<eos> [Laughs]<eos> No one's looking for you.
Huck might be dead.<eos> My Huck.<eos> You really want to lecture me right now?<eos> You think I'm in the mood?<eos> Do you think I won't get a chair and work it out on you?
Then you're worthless.<eos> [Footsteps]<eos> ♪<eos> Where do you think you're going?<eos> You think I'm gonna let you out so you can go get protection from your friends?
Where do you think you're going?<eos> You think I'm gonna let you out so you can go get protection from your friends?<eos> Get in there.<eos> You get in there and wait till Quinn finds out what you did and, Abby, I will not call her off.<eos> I will not save you from her.
- It was you? !<eos> - ♪ It's up to you ♪<eos> Okay, calm down!<eos> Come on.<eos> I will kill you!
Where are you going?<eos> - I have a date.<eos> - What?<eos> Did you hear what I said?<eos> I came all the way out here from California to tell you in person that I left my wife.
- What?<eos> Did you hear what I said?<eos> I came all the way out here from California to tell you in person that I left my wife.<eos> Next time, make an appointment.<eos> I came here to ask you to marry me.
- What?<eos> No one is looking at us.<eos> I know that.<eos> When are you gonna get over this?<eos> I'll see you at the party.
- That's enough, Liv.<eos> - There you go.<eos> Get mad.<eos> - Why are you doing this?<eos> - Because I'm sick of seeing you like this.
- I get it, Liv.<eos> - You don't.<eos> I lost!<eos> You wanted the Oval, and I didn't give it to you.<eos> No, I didn't give it to you!
Kind of easy to say now, isn't it?<eos> I could've fixed the election.<eos> Defiance County...<eos> It could have been yours.<eos> I could have given it to you.
Abby. The man was dead in the water once it was clear to you he would never be President.<eos> I don't blame him for losing.<eos> I know...<eos> You blame yourself.<eos> You look at him, and you see your own failure, and it disgusts you.
I know.<eos> She screams real nice.<eos> But she also helped kill the future President and framed Cyrus for his murder.<eos> It's a lot to take in.<eos> Try to act natural... 'cause, David, if she suspects you know, she will kill you.
Why are you really here?<eos> You don't even like me.<eos> I don't like people.<eos> But, believe it or not...<eos> I respect you.
I would stake my life on it.<eos> Dad?<eos> What's going on, Dad?<eos> It's been too long.<eos> I wanted to see you.
You need to stop doing what you're doing.<eos> You need to stop trying to make Cyrus President.<eos> I'm giving him back what they took.<eos> There is nothing to get back.<eos> When these people take from you, it is gone.
There's simply life and death.<eos> I remain useful to these people because I assume they believe I maintain a certain level of influence over you.<eos> If that goes away, if you walk out that door without heeding my advice, I am useless to them.<eos> I am extinct.<eos> It was really good to see you, Dad.
This isn't about truth and justice. It's about something else.<eos> Boy, I am the director of the FBI, not some chick who got dissed at prom.<eos> I'm filing this warrant, and Olivia Pope is going to answer my questions.<eos> I hope you can respect that, respect how I do my job.<eos> And I hope to see you later.
Your... Your proper channels of law and precedent and decency?<eos> They don't care!<eos> Mellie!<eos> Breathe!<eos> We are going to get you out of here.
We are in this together.<eos> This is just one bump on a long journey for you and me, okay?<eos> Now, first things first.<eos> Do you keep a spare suit or dress in the closet?<eos> Good, because I'm gonna ask you to step out of this one slowly and carefully.
I can't let you do this.<eos> You don't have a choice, Mr. President.<eos> The Deputy Bureau Chief just came into my office and told me that Olivia Pope is not being arrested and that he is now leading the investigation, reporting directly to you.<eos> You did this.<eos> In lieu of transferring you to the field office in Omaha.
It's done.<eos> I'm sorry, liv. I'm s...<eos> What did you do? Hey, hey!<eos> Quit it!<eos> I will kill you!
And not to worry, mells... Our cabinet will rock.<eos> But first, we have a much, much bigger vacancy to fill. Vacancy?<eos> What vacancy?<eos> What?<eos> There's someone here to see you. Who?
How much time do we have?<eos> 75 minutes, tops, until we're taken off of lockdown.<eos> Someone needs to tell me what is happening.<eos> The drone is ours, madame president-elect.<eos> We're running a play in order to take you back.
Worthless.<eos> What did you say?<eos> I said "worthless," as in everyone in this room,<eos> As in you, as in this inconsequential, Futile, worthless attempt. To get rid of the problem at hand.<eos> You know I wanted to arrest you, throw you in the supermax?
I had a lot of feelings I needed working out.<eos> Robin, I-i don't...<eos> No, keep chewing.<eos> My point is, I don't want to act like you're worrying about nothing.<eos> I don't blame you for feeling threatened.
Well, you can finish dinner.<eos> Sorry, I have to get that or he won't stop.<eos> - And I don't want him to worry. - Yes...<eos> Guille.<eos> I can't talk now, I'll call you in a while.
Vanesa!<eos> Vanesa hasn't come to work today.<eos> She called.<eos> She says she can't come in because she's sick.<eos> She also says she wants to talk to you.
I don't need that money.<eos> Well I do, Vanesa, I do!<eos> That's why I asked for it!<eos> Calm down, Alexis.<eos> He gave it to me to give to you and get you to work.
Alright.<eos> If you won't take a gift, you'll have to give me something in exchange.<eos> What can I give you?<eos> Let's make a deal.<eos> You keep the diamonds and I get to know you.
I do.<eos> You're soft.<eos> I've been touched a lot, all of my life.<eos> But they touch me, then go.<eos> Don't cover yourself up, I can't see you.
Guille, I've gone out for a walk.<eos> I usually don't go out in the mornings, nor in the evenings, but today I need a little air.<eos> I haven't slept all night and it helped me think...<eos> I think you should keep that money.<eos> I only ask you for one thing.
You're smarter.<eos> Ganymede Station refugee ships are now arriving at docks three and seven.<eos> All personnel please report.<eos> Refugee ships waiting to clear...<eos> And despite the circumstances, it'll be good to see you again, setara.
Diogo Harari.<eos> Forgive the intrusion.<eos> I'm Anderson Dawes.<eos> I wanted to meet the boy who was found floating beyond Hidalgo.<eos> How long were you out there before those rock hoppers picked you up?
The new arrivals just left.<eos> They must have locked it on their way out.<eos> - What?<eos> - It's time.<eos> He wants to see you.
No harm.<eos> We good, Art?<eos> We done?<eos> We're just getting started, partner.<eos> Let's take you home and tuck you in.
You're meant to put that in your uterus?<eos> I was kind of hoping you would, actually.<eos> No!<eos> No way.<eos> You and I are going to go find Charlotte and we're going to get you to somewhere safe.
I was kind of hoping you would, actually.<eos> No!<eos> No way.<eos> You and I are going to go find Charlotte and we're going to get you to somewhere safe.<eos> They'll treat you there.
- What?<eos> That's got to be for me.<eos> You have to go!<eos> Oh, Christ.<eos> I really don't want to leave you here.
Exactly.<eos> That face right there.<eos> I...<eos> How does that help?<eos> Mm, humanizes you?
I trained with dogs in the army for three years.<eos> It's the only thing that kept me sane.<eos> I know when a dog's thirsty.<eos> You're still thirsty, ain't you, boy? And what about me?<eos> Every time we're on patrol, you act like I'm torturing you when I get an iced tea.
I didn't know, okay?<eos> - He came to me, and he wanted... - GIDEON:<eos> What?<eos> What?<eos> Who-who came to you?
Nice work.<eos> Well I had some help.<eos> Is she... ?<eos> Baby?<eos> Hey. Some people are here to see you.
But not only Green Kryptonite rained down from the skies.<eos> There are so many more ways to harm your kind than to simply weaken you.<eos> (SCREAMS)<eos> Silver Kryptonite.<eos> Your cousin is so much like you.
You have to fight it!<eos> (GRUNTS)<eos> (GROANS)<eos> Hey, hey!<eos> It's okay, I got you.
What happened?<eos> (OBJECTS CLATTER)<eos> That chessboard's been in the Luthor family for generations.<eos> Did you come here to yell at me for not treating the family heirlooms with respect, or to blame me for what's happening outside?<eos> How could you let that woman deceive you?
I'm sorry.<eos> (SCOFFS)<eos> I am, Lena.<eos> When you came to visit me in jail, I honestly wanted to be a better mother to you.<eos> But every time I've had the opportunity to choose you over something else...
Hi.<eos> Hey. I'm sure... You probably don't remember me.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Winn Schott, resident genius of the DEO?<eos> It's good to see you, buddy.
(SCREAMS)<eos> (EXHALES) Well, at least he tried.<eos> - You came.<eos> - You called.<eos> They followed you.
Here, here.<eos> (COUGHS)<eos> Take this.<eos> Take this.<eos> This will keep you safe.
Gus, Gus,<eos> - Period.<eos> I don't think that your job is stupid.<eos> In fact, it's... it's such a big promotion that.<eos> I-I was just surprised that your boss gave it to you.
But this opportunity in Napa, it's... it's... it's what's best for your career, which is every bit as important as mine.<eos> So we'll... we'll try the long-distance thing.<eos> Besides, I'll be too busy here to get into any trouble.<eos> And I'm sure that Aiden will... Aiden will keep you very busy, too.<eos> - I'm not asking you for this.
- Captain?<eos> Albert's daughter Sofia has been cleared by a doctor.<eos> When do you wanna bring her in?<eos> I'm already running behind.<eos> So I'm just gonna drop you off at the corner if that's okay.
I-I'm sorry.<eos> Um, just having to change a few plans.<eos> - You know, kids get anxious...<eos> - Kids?<eos> I'm telling you for the last time, helping out the family of the man who killed your father...
The problem.<eos> You want to know what the problem is?<eos> The problem is... children aren't supposed to do this for parents.<eos> Parents are supposed to do this for children.<eos> Mom, at a certain point aren't we supposed to do things for you?
We could smoke all of Frankie's pot.<eos> I promised her if I ever smoked the pot I would do it with her.<eos> Or... it's a double "fuck you."<eos> I don't care for that language... but fuck her!<eos> You know what might help you right now?
Fine. Give it away.<eos> Seriously?<eos> Brought chairs, you guys, in case you want to take a load off.<eos> What is he doing here?<eos> I didn't think I'd see you here, brother.
Ah, that's something for each new despot to, uh, puzzle out themselves. Anyway.<eos> You're on the right track.<eos> Now we just need the bait.<eos> As soon as I'm finished with this, I'm ready.<eos> He knows you.
"Hello, Henry.<eos> "If you're reading this, I was right<eos> "and everyone else at Brakebills was wrong.<eos> "How delightful.<eos> "It also means I'll see you quick as one, two, nine.
Am I not enough for you?<eos> You're great.<eos> For... who you are.<eos> It's just...<eos> I already told you.
Hey.<eos> Hey, um...<eos> I-I got your message in my bathroom mirror.<eos> It was freaky.<eos> Look, um, I'm not supposed to tell you what I'm gonna tell you.
I work 45 minutes a night.<eos> I got tons of hours to kill during the day. - Hey, Artie.<eos> - Yeah, gimme the... Hey!<eos> Jimmy Norton. - How you doing?<eos> - Good to see you, man. Good to see you, buddy.
Just try to blend in.<eos> - Pete?<eos> What's up, man?<eos> I'm so glad you could make it.<eos> - Nice to see you. - You too.
Why?<eos> Just, you know, you hear things.<eos> I don't know what people have been saying, but...<eos> Hey, that's... that's fine. We don't have to talk about it.<eos> I just wanted to bring you in and offer you some support, and I'd love to lift you up in prayer, if that's okay.
This is free, I hope. Right?<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> Pete.<eos> Sorry, I...<eos> I wasn't expecting to see you. - Well...
- What are you doing here?<eos> - I can't believe you followed me here.<eos> You're not answering my calls, Jess.<eos> Of course I'm not answering your calls. I don't want to talk to you.<eos> I had to follow you to talk to you. - What is he doing here?
My friends think I'm like a wicked fucking idiot who had sex with the hand-turkey guy!<eos> You're not even a real artist, okay?<eos> - I'm an idiot for fucking you!<eos> - Thank you.<eos> That all hurts, and I thank you for having the courage to give it to me, but whatever person you need me to become,
Hold on.<eos> - Sir, would you hold this, please? - Sure.<eos> Wait.<eos> I forgive you.<eos> Jess, we've both strayed from the path, but I forgive you.
The dudes. It's over.<eos> - The riot's over? - Holy shit.<eos> They're coming to rescue us?<eos> "Us"?<eos> They're gonna rescue you, crucify us.
I got an idea.<eos> All right. Um, stay with her.<eos> All right?<eos> Just stay with her.<eos> I can't lose you too. For real, I can't lose you too.
- What?<eos> Critics will be watching...<eos> Stronger?<eos> Just because the Kremlin cowboy hunts tigers, it doesn't make him strong.<eos> Dad, can I talk to you about something?
I mean, what can you hide in a grape?<eos> But it's not just that.<eos> I miss my old life, my old friends.<eos> I didn't run for office, you know.<eos> Might just grow on you, T.
There will be no more of this foolishness, and you are not to be around this boy without supervision.<eos> - But, Father, I...<eos> - No.<eos> I was wrong to bring you on this trip.<eos> I thought it would be good for you.
This is... This is great.<eos> I thought we agreed that you would stop spying on people.<eos> But they're spying on people, too.<eos> That is their job!<eos> My job is to protect you.
Yes.<eos> Okay.<eos> You done, pal?<eos> I'm finished, all right.<eos> Don't let it get you down, T.
What do we have to do?<eos> We need to give them Broussard.<eos> I have to say, Mr. Bowman, I didn't think you had it in you.<eos> I'm curious whether when you stole my keycard to help your attractive, fanatical girlfriend you thought about the consequences to not only yourself but every other person in this place.<eos> Today I'm not the prison warden who's gonna threaten you with punishment.

Ohh.<eos> - Was anyone else involved?<eos> - No.<eos> You've just been lying to me.<eos> Why should I believe you now?
- I have him.<eos> - Wait. Who is that?<eos> That's just my backup, sweetheart.<eos> I'm not going anywhere unless I speak to Hennessey.<eos> The Occupation is looking for you,
Look, I'm sorry. I know you had your hopes up.<eos> But that's why there's whiskey.<eos> Can I just have my phone for five minutes, please?<eos> Just to post something on Instagram.<eos> Just say your prayers like I told you.
You haven't heard?<eos> Whole town blew up.<eos> What town?<eos> Come on. She's in back.<eos> They're asking for you.
Pardon me a second.<eos> What is it, head points, what?<eos> Just because your father has money doesn't mean you can cut.<eos> Hmm, it kind of looks like it does.<eos> All right, I'll tell you what:
I'm here for my hounds.<eos> Huh!<eos> Preposterous. I raised those hounds from pups.<eos> I'm the only master they've ever known.<eos> One word from me and they'll rip you apart.
Why?<eos> Because you told me to!<eos> In your own last chapter.<eos> "You will never be truly ruthless until you destroy the one who made you."<eos> I had to tear you down, M.B.!
- Homie, those kids' hands are covered in barbeque sauce.<eos> I know someone who's gonna get a sink bath tonight.<eos> No!<eos> Get away from him!<eos> - I'll spray you!
I'm truly sorry, Bart, but it's a wound nothing can heal.<eos> A bunny and a hammer?<eos> Well, my mom did say bring home dinner.<eos> Homer, listen, hey,<eos> I got something very scary to tell you.
Really?<eos> Hold your horses!<eos> Lisa!<eos> Stupid Lisa!<eos> I've got something to show you!
Get out there, you little shit.<eos> - Where's Dawes?<eos> - Don't know.<eos> Let me check my pockets.<eos> You're going to tell me everything he said, or I'm going to break you in two.
We're traveling together.<eos> Inners only.<eos> - I guess I could stay.<eos> - No, no, it's okay.<eos> I'll join you as soon as I can.
Okay?<eos> I won't say anything.<eos> I promise I won't say anything to anyone.<eos> Just please don't hurt me.<eos> We're not going to hurt you.
Listen, please, just listen to him.<eos> Don't, don't!<eos> Bill, let go!<eos> Bill, listen to me.<eos> Whatever she's showing you, whatever she's letting you see.
- Do you?<eos> - Actually, I do.<eos> Uh, it comes from the inner bark of several trees of the genus Cinnamomum.<eos> Now, this bark contains certain oils that provide the...<eos> Thank you so much for doing this.
He's looking for you.<eos> I assume you have the proper paperwork for transferring a prisoner?<eos> - Probably not.<eos> - Don't worry.<eos> We're not gonna kill you.
What was that about?<eos> Apparently he was gonna be your new captain.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I think I'm turning back.<eos> All right, we need to get you out of here.
This little game is over as of right now.<eos> It's not a game, and it's not over.<eos> Now, if you think Portland's big enough for two Sean Renards, think again.<eos> You'll always be contradicting yourself.<eos> No one is ever gonna believe you.
- No, no.<eos> I'll know if he's not alone.<eos> He doesn't know about the tunnels.<eos> You go with Hank in case Renard puts someone on Adalind.<eos> We'll find a way to get you back.
He doesn't know about the tunnels.<eos> You go with Hank in case Renard puts someone on Adalind.<eos> We'll find a way to get you back.<eos> Be careful.<eos> So, if I shoot you, is that considered suicide?
Yeah.<eos> Oh.<eos> Mm.<eos> So... how did it go?<eos> I tried to tell you.
It feels like there's always this thick fog over my memory and I can't seen through it.<eos> You're lucky.<eos> Every single day, I get screwed by my memories.<eos> It's better to be pure.<eos> Like you.
It's too dangerous.<eos> And highly irresponsible.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> You see any bad code headed my way, pull me out.<eos> How come you're the one sweating?
You know, the scan... also turned up the number of glitches.<eos> They've been getting worse.<eos> Since when?<eos> Since the deep dive.<eos> Do any of the glitches mean something to you?
- What else I got?<eos> - They suit you.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> I got night vision,...* and X-ray.<eos> I guess I see like you now.
Is it a tall building?<eos> It's a tall place, right?<eos> You don't have a child.<eos> You don't have a wife.<eos> You live alone, just you.
Connecting.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Come here.<eos> I'm shy.*<eos> I'm not beautiful... like you.
You were born of lessons they took from my failure.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I was conscious while they dismembered my body, and discarded me like garbage.<eos> I was lying on a table, listening to doctors talk about how my mind had not meshed with the shell, that they had built;<eos> how project t-two, five, seven, one had failed, and they had to move on... to you.
It was inevitable that we will be failures.<eos> How many?<eos> ...Dozens.<eos> How many?<eos> 98 unsuccessful attempts, before you.
I dunno who to trust anymore.<eos> You trust me, right?<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> I just don't like it.<eos> I need you to take me back.
There is no place for us here.<eos> No,<eos> I'm not ready to leave.<eos> I belong here.<eos> I'll always be there with you, in your ghost.
Just happened to know I spoke English.<eos> Go figure.<eos> The bullets could've been real.<eos> Then the body armor would've been real.<eos> I don't know you, but... I don't like to be tested.
They're ghosts, in a day and age where that kind of thing is almost impossible.<eos> Okay, you get that I don't work for suits.<eos> What makes you think I'm gonna want to ruin all their fun?<eos> Well, if you won't do it for me, do it for Gibbons.<eos> Your country needs you, Mr. Cage.
Okay, you get that I don't work for suits.<eos> What makes you think I'm gonna want to ruin all their fun?<eos> Well, if you won't do it for me, do it for Gibbons.<eos> Your country needs you, Mr. Cage.<eos> The Triple-X program needs you.
And I'm not talking about the first Terminator, but the second Terminator that goes back to kill the first Terminator.<eos> It was the liquidy metal guy.<eos> Agent Clearidge worked closely with Gibbons.<eos> She'll handle support for the operation.<eos> And I bet a guy like you needs a lot of support.
I can't believe this shit.<eos> I'm not gonna have clowns watch my back.<eos> I know I'm gonna regret asking you this, but who would you trust?<eos> You know, no one has this number.<eos> So, what are you up to these days?
MI6?<eos> You're not the kind of subtle they prefer.<eos> You know, the men who come to this island, they're on the run.<eos> Hiding from the world.<eos> But not you.
Officially, you're deranged.<eos> Cool.<eos> We'll set up a triangulated signal tracking system around the city.<eos> And when Becky locks in his exact location, we make our move.<eos> What about you?
Andy, is that you?
Well, maybe Dawkins was involved in the robbery.<eos> Why would a guy who owns a bank need money?<eos> That is an excellent question.<eos> Do they teach you that at Quantico?<eos> Mm. - Rippin' on you.
Hey, what took you so long?<eos> Zeke. He parked outside the house for hours.<eos> I had to wait.<eos> That's my girl. Always thinking.<eos> Hey, I don't know about you, but I'm starvin'.
Martha, he's my brother and I love him, but, ultimately, it's gonna come down to how bad he wants to save himself.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> Why are you crying, Mommy?<eos> I'm sorry, Martha.<eos> You and Sally deserve better than this.
Get in the back, you fat fuckin' bastard.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> That's real nice. That's real nice.<eos> You're a nice little girl.<eos> You know, I'm a police officer just like you.
Long enough for you to come out a different person.<eos> Maybe you lose some of those girlish good looks.<eos> Maybe you come out an old lady. Hey, maybe you don't come out at all.<eos> Steph, listen.<eos> - No, you listen. He'll kill me.
He's going to Mexico.<eos> He said he had one more thing to take care of, but don't ask me what because I don't know.<eos> Ed isn't much into discussing business with me.<eos> - So what do you think?<eos> - I don't know. What do you think that one more thing was?
You make it sound so simple.<eos> What about Judge Dawkins?<eos> Nobody cares that he signed off on Ed's plea deal.<eos> We're not talking about Judge Dawkins. We're talking about my brother.<eos> We're talking about you.
- Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> I just gotta take a shit, that's all.<eos> - How romantic.<eos> - Oh, sorry, honey.<eos> It's not you. It's the drugs.
Why don't you just go?<eos> You've got everything.<eos> You've got a career.<eos> In fact, I heard you're running for the goddamn Senate.<eos> What does Ed have on you?
Reed Ethington, I'd like you to meet the two gentlemen our government has sent down here to assist us in our hour of need.<eos> So, let's head over to Morrow's place.<eos> If any of 'em are dumb enough to head home, it'd have to be Chris.<eos> We'll follow you.<eos> What's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this?
No, no, not the same as us because he's the one that ended up with all the money.<eos> Right, well, he wants to settle up, split the cash, and then we all go our separate ways.<eos> Well.<eos> I can't go nowhere until after I meet up with Andy at ten.<eos> No, Chris, just you.
Adiós.<eos> - Chris!<eos> - Steph?<eos> - Over here.<eos> - Is that you?
I always figured you sorta hated me on account of what happened to Ed Jr.<eos> That was an accident.<eos> Put your gun down, Chris.<eos> Relax.<eos> Who the hell are you?
Robbing banks isn't exactly straight and narrow.<eos> Then why are you doing it?<eos> - That's a stupid fucking question.<eos> - Why are you doing it?<eos> - For you.
- That's a stupid fucking question.<eos> - Why are you doing it?<eos> - For you.<eos> - Bullshit.<eos> You're doing it for you.
You weren't even on the team when they won.<eos> Okay, hey, sweetie.<eos> Hey! You know what?<eos> I'm so sorry I'm gonna miss your thing tonight, but I have an idea.<eos> What about tomorrow you and me, we go to Funland?
She's got school tomorrow.<eos> You don't want to skip school and spend the day with your dad?<eos> - Can Lissa come?<eos> - No, Lissa can't come.<eos> No, it's just you and me.
I guess people really don't like dead kids, huh?<eos> Yeah, no shit.<eos> They fucking love 'em.<eos> We had some pretty good times back in the day.<eos> You and me.
What the fuck is going on?<eos> - Justice, Ed.<eos> - Justice. Justice for what?<eos> We couldn't just let you get away with it.<eos> Not you.
Stop saying that. Ed.<eos> Do you remember back when we were all so close?<eos> Steph and I made a mistake.<eos> No.<eos> I stayed with you because I still loved you.
Hi. Hey.<eos> You're here.<eos> That's c...<eos> Why are you here?<eos> Same as you.
That is why I'm here today.<eos> Rodriguez Hayes must be overjoyed.<eos> Actually, I heard they were fighting.<eos> Okay, look.<eos> Teddy broke up with you.
Actually, I heard they were fighting.<eos> Okay, look.<eos> Teddy broke up with you.<eos> I know how hard that can be, okay?<eos> A long time ago, he broke up with me to go out with you, so I get it.
That's your first question.<eos> What was I supposed to say, El?<eos> I constantly disappoint you.<eos> Then you tell me that you think our kid will grow up thinking that I'm just a joke.<eos> That I was never good enough for you.
I was in prison because I stole $125,000 from the father of the bride.<eos> It was not a table of honor.<eos> I have a bag of dope in my room.<eos> Room 115 for the dope in case any of you feel that a bag of dope would be fun to do.<eos> Not you.
It was not a table of honor.<eos> I have a bag of dope in my room.<eos> Room 115 for the dope in case any of you feel that a bag of dope would be fun to do.<eos> Not you.<eos> And not you.
No, not really.<eos> Thank you for trying.<eos> My junior prom is tonight.<eos> But my mom said I'd probably have a better chance here where nobody knew me, so...<eos> I would have danced with you.
Thank you for trying.<eos> My junior prom is tonight.<eos> But my mom said I'd probably have a better chance here where nobody knew me, so...<eos> I would have danced with you.<eos> Now, in high school, I certainly would have danced with you.
Excuse me?<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> That's disgusting.<eos> This wedding is over for you.
Truly wonderful day.<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> He's such a great guy.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sorry about being so far away from you today.
Wait, what baby?<eos> It's a great screwup!<eos> It's this perfect screwup!<eos> What?<eos> I don't want to be disappointed by anybody but you!
It's a great screwup!<eos> It's this perfect screwup!<eos> What?<eos> I don't want to be disappointed by anybody but you!<eos> And I don't want to disappoint anybody but you.
Just, like, shout out across a lake at me, in front of a bunch of strangers, about how you really felt about me?<eos> We shout at each other in front of strangers all the time.<eos> I'll take that as a no.<eos> Would you do that for me?<eos> Well, the you then or you now?
Goodnight, Mom.<eos> Goodnight, Teddy.<eos> Bye, Carol.<eos> Thought you didn't have family.<eos> The evidence is mounting up against you, Walter.
Yeah, I am.<eos> She, daddy and I, we all love somebody like crazy.<eos> - Do you know who that is?<eos> - Me!<eos> You!
She, daddy and I, we all love somebody like crazy.<eos> - Do you know who that is?<eos> - Me!<eos> You!<eos> You.
No, son.<eos> She's out of the car.<eos> She's looking for you.<eos> She's telling everyone she's looking for a little boy named Frankie.<eos> You think that's you?
Ma'am, are you there?<eos> - Ma'am? Ma'am?<eos> - Hang up, hang up.<eos> Terry, are you back?<eos> Terry, was that you on the phone?
Don't you touch my dick!<eos> I'm okay.<eos> Ronnie, are you okay?<eos> Yeah, no, I'm good.<eos> I'm proud of you, Ronnie.
You know, you wanna be on our team, you're gonna have to pass this course.<eos> - We all do.<eos> - Look.<eos> Mitch, right?<eos> - Lieutenant to you.
We're starting bright and early tomorrow.<eos> How was your first riptide?<eos> It stings!<eos> That's just the lactic acid.<eos> Actually, it's the jellyfish stuck to you.
I don't know.<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Honestly, I don't even know what I'm doing here.<eos> Mitch sees something in you.
Oh, my God.<eos> Well, we're gonna be<eos> - in swimsuits a lot, so...<eos> - Yeah.<eos> If it's gonna be a problem for you...
I can't feel my face!<eos> Okay, call Coast Guard.<eos> We got a 10-73.<eos> - I'm gonna take the WaveRunner. - "10-73"?<eos> You and C.J. take Rescue One.
Brody!<eos> Are you okay?<eos> That was such a great plan, just to see fire and just swim right into it.<eos> You care about me.<eos> I care about you.
...eight, nine, ten.<eos> Come on.<eos> Hey, other than him, we did good, right?<eos> Like, we saved everyone.<eos> Yes, including you.
I just thought you had to be on a really restrictive diet to look like you guys.<eos> Brody, what is it that you think we do here at Baywatch?<eos> I thought we were lifeguards.<eos> I thought that we prevent people from getting sunburned and, yeah, occasionally stop them from drowning.<eos> And that's all you think that this is?
Well, I'm not exactly sure what a sand grifter is, Stephanie.<eos> But I would probably call the cops.<eos> Sand grifters are beach thieves.<eos> Okay, so while you're working on your tan, they're stealing things from families on the beach.<eos> I'll give you one better.
You look really nice.<eos> Hey, you look really nice, too, Baby Gap.<eos> That shirt come in big-boy size?<eos> Well, at least I'm undercover.<eos> Look at you.
Thank you.<eos> So many people.<eos> So as a welcome to the bay, I...<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Mitch, this is for you.
The big whale gets away?<eos> Do you hear yourself when you talk?<eos> I dare you to say one thing without the ocean in it.<eos> I dare you.<eos> We were depending on you tonight.
But when it came to the relay, being part of your team, your Olympic team, your family, you blew it. 'Cause you're selfish.<eos> Baywatch is our team. Baywatch is our family.<eos> These are the keys to our house.<eos> But you've proven to me that you don't want to be part of this family.<eos> So you're done.
- Grab his other leg.<eos> - Got it.<eos> Get a stretcher ready.<eos> Yeah, this is the police.<eos> How can I help you, lifeguard?
Your new post.<eos> No.<eos> I'm not ready.<eos> I'm not ready for this, man.<eos> They need you.
They need you.<eos> Hi, Mitch.<eos> Just checking in on you again.<eos> Please call us back.<eos> We're worried about you.
- Yes, Mitch.<eos> Come on, man.<eos> You don't just protect the bay.<eos> You are the bay.<eos> Mitch, the bay needs you.
What you got in the cooler?<eos> Black market organs from the Boogie Board Bandits?<eos> You mean this?<eos> No, no.<eos> This is actually for you.
You know, I shouldn't.<eos> But it is my cheat day.<eos> It's your cheat day.<eos> Exactly.<eos> And by the way, I went ahead and added that extra protein for you, dawg.
- You took marine biology, right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Look at these.<eos> Tell me what you think.<eos> Do these look like shark bites to you?
- Evidence.<eos> Well, why didn't you say so, man?<eos> - Heck, yeah!<eos> - Thank God you're pretty.<eos> I'm really proud of you, man.
But Leeds is having a party on her yacht tonight.<eos> I guarantee you, she found a way to get that guy into her boat.<eos> Which is why we're gonna go to that party.<eos> What?<eos> Summer, you and I are going to find the flakka.
- For Mitch.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Lifeguards, this is a surprise.<eos> - Oh, hi!<eos> Victoria, we wanted to come here in person and tell you how excited we are to be working with you instead of against you, now that...
Come on.<eos> Wakey-wakey, pretty little dum-dum.<eos> Such a shame.<eos> Why'd you have to go snooping?<eos> Maybe Thorpe was wrong about you after all.
I hope that doesn't make the boob-lers...<eos> All right.<eos> I'd love it if you wore tighter pants.<eos> I really would.<eos> Why do you get to play Mitch Buchannon?
Okay.<eos> I love the sky on mornings like this.<eos> Greasy forehead, window, off.<eos> I'm gonna try not to be depressed because I'm single on Cupid Day.<eos> That's Valentine's Day to you!
I'd never let my best friend die a virgin.<eos> You didn't think we'd forget, did you?<eos> It's the big day, opening night.<eos> Rob texted me.<eos> He said, "I made my bed for you."
We're fine.<eos> You're crazy!<eos> We're freakin' fine.<eos> Go ahead and say we're through.<eos> I don't care, I'll just get another you
You're crazy!<eos> We're freakin' fine.<eos> Go ahead and say we're through.<eos> I don't care, I'll just get another you<eos> I'll get another dude that look like you
We're freakin' fine.<eos> Go ahead and say we're through.<eos> I don't care, I'll just get another you<eos> I'll get another dude that look like you<eos> I don't need you and you don't need me.
You used to never get the message.<eos> Yeah, I talk shit.<eos> Yeah, she's talkin' shit.<eos> Go ahead and say we're through.<eos> I don't care I'll just get another you
Yeah, I talk shit.<eos> Yeah, she's talkin' shit.<eos> Go ahead and say we're through.<eos> I don't care I'll just get another you<eos> I'll get another dude that look like you
Yeah, she's talkin' shit.<eos> Go ahead and say we're through.<eos> I don't care I'll just get another you<eos> I'll get another dude that look like you<eos> I don't need you and you don't need me.
Baes!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Fart's house is actually kinda nice.<eos> If I had known, I would have stopped calling him Danny DeVito all year.<eos> Sam and you.
Yes!<eos> Like in Patrick's mouth?<eos> What?<eos> Oh, she's so shitfaced!<eos> No, you're shitfaced, shitface.
You're a goddamn fetid bitch just like your mother.<eos> It's no wonder Daddy left. Huh?<eos> - You're a bitch, too. - What?<eos> You're a drunk.<eos> And you...
Sorry.<eos> I was FaceTiming with Patrick till, like, 3:00.<eos> Speaking of which, are you nervous for tonight?<eos> What?<eos> You, Rob, his flannel sheets?
The more roses you get on Cupid Day, the more popular you are, right?<eos> Thanks for the tip, Kent.<eos> Noted.<eos> Well, I didn't say the rose was from me.<eos> But it is from you, right?
Can you wait that long?<eos> This room is off limits.<eos> I was just looking for the bathroom.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I feel like I'm having déjà vu with you being in my room.
Just like your mother.<eos> No wonder Daddy left. Huh?<eos> - You're a bitch, too. - What?<eos> You're a drunk.<eos> And you...
Can I borrow something?<eos> Always.<eos> I got you.<eos> Hey.<eos> Uh, these came for you in Daimler's class.
Hey.<eos> Uh, these came for you in Daimler's class.<eos> I know I'm not wearing the appropriate attire, but I promise they're legitimate.<eos> Cool.<eos> Also, uh, this rose came for you.
Or...<eos> No, I can't.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> Well, I'm... I could have crutches on call for you, in case you want to climb up the tree...
I'm going back to sleep.<eos> I'm going to sleep in my room.<eos> I'm going with her.<eos> You were friends with Juliet?<eos> No one even talked to you in fifth grade, and I don't hold that against you.
Take it.<eos> Unless you want to be a walking STD farm.<eos> You would know.<eos> At least I'm not still a virgin.<eos> What the hell is wrong with you?
Why do you care so much, Elody?<eos> Because...<eos> You guys are all I have.<eos> Are you still trying to turn her against me?<eos> You're the horrible driver.
It was very ambitious.<eos> I should go.<eos> Hey, hey, hey. Hey.<eos> Just stay for a second. Okay?<eos> I can drive you home or...
Here.<eos> I'm sorry about earlier.<eos> Don't worry about that.<eos> No, I'm sorry<eos> I've always been so mean to you.
It's different.<eos> But you have a big heart, Sam.<eos> That doesn't go away.<eos> One good thing.<eos> You just focus on that one good thing, and you see where it leads you.
Yeah, not so good in the morning, though.<eos> It's like waking up in...<eos> In the middle of the sun.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I hope you don't think that it's weird that I'm here with you right now.
Get away from me.<eos> And I feel really bad about it, and I know this may sound crazy, but I have a feeling I may be able to understand you better than you think that I could.<eos> You hate me.<eos> I don't hate you.<eos> I know we haven't always been the nicest to you, but the thing is that Lindsay didn't mean anything by it.
I love you, too, old man.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Sammy, you forgot your gloves!<eos> What would I do without you?
Listen to me.<eos> I'm trying to tell you how sorry...<eos> I am sorry.<eos> You said that.<eos> I'm sorry, but I have to come with you.
Don't you get it?<eos> You can't help me.<eos> I can't be fixed.<eos> You're not the one who needs fixing.<eos> There is nothing wrong with you.
The whole point?<eos> No, it couldn't be that simple.<eos> Here's one.<eos> And then it was over.<eos> That's it for you.
I had a boy, and his name was Ethan.<eos> I got a name.<eos> My name was Bailey, Bailey, Bailey, Bailey, Bailey.<eos> Oh, gee.<eos> I wish I'd have known that you and Wes were...
Maybe you saw Smokey.<eos> - Definitely not Smokey.<eos> - It wasn't Smokey.<eos> I really don't like rats.<eos> It's more scared of you than you are of him.
You just get it to him every time.<eos> Yeah, exactly. 'Cause every time you run that play...<eos> Everybody wanted to walk next to the alpha male.<eos> Almost everybody.<eos> Ethan, why do you always have this dog with you?
Oh, I'm sorry, Todd.<eos> Did my girlfriend replacement just trip you?<eos> Very funny.<eos> Relax, man.<eos> The dog's laughing at you.
Well, maybe you should teach your dog some manners.<eos> I've been trying.<eos> He's not too smart.<eos> Really?<eos> Did you hear what he said about you?
We've got you.<eos> Good boy.<eos> Good boy.<eos> I'll check around back!<eos> I'm here, right behind you.
They're here. They're here.<eos> I'm being careful.<eos> Hey, sweetie.<eos> Good to see you.<eos> Oh, look at you.
Yeah, if you want.<eos> I just thought it'd be nice if we could get out of the house.<eos> Get you out.<eos> What?<eos> Look, Hannah, it's nice for you to try, but you don't have to...
Get you out.<eos> What?<eos> Look, Hannah, it's nice for you to try, but you don't have to...<eos> You don't have to do this. You don't have to help me.<eos> I'm not doing it for you.
And I'll be here.<eos> With that.<eos> You have to stop feeling sorry for yourself.<eos> You can't do this for me, Hannah.<eos> I'd do anything for you.
Not so much fun, really.<eos> But I did good work.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Now I'm tiny, and all ears!<eos> Hi, you.
Ugh! Tino, I'm spending way too much time alone.<eos> You wanna go get some ice cream?<eos> You've read my mind.<eos> I think this is it, Tino.<eos> I think it's just gonna be you and me.
Sure.<eos> No!<eos> No, don't leave me here.<eos> This is a white-coat place.<eos> I belong with you.
Do you wanna go?<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> I was back in the front seat.<eos> Okay, buddy.<eos> Guess it's gonna be you and me.
But I guess he's not home.<eos> Hi, Ethan.<eos> Hi, Hannah.<eos> I brought your dog home.<eos> Must have been tough on you, losing your husband after all those years.
Thanks.<eos> Well, this place is still the same.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Oh, come on!<eos> So, what about you?
A sad, pointless charade built on lies.<eos> You have to have the courage to go your own way.<eos> Happiness is hard to come by.<eos> Sure as hell aren't gonna find it in some stupid gadget.<eos> There you are, tapping on some little box... while the real shit is happening all around you, dumbass.
Yes, I do, yeah.<eos> I hate you.<eos> Don't get me wrong, I've got nothing but love for my fellow human beings.<eos> I'm a people person all the way, one hundred percent.<eos> Look at you.
You don't want to have to be the ones to cart poor old... Wilson to the hospital when he conks out.<eos> Get out while the going's good.<eos> Smart move!<eos> Holy shit.<eos> This has nothing to do with you, Wilson.
Who's this crazy kid, man?<eos> Who's this guy?<eos> Diego.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> Wait, I thought it was just you.
Yeah, everything was fine all that time until he just up and says...<eos> "I'm into dudes," you know?<eos> I'm done with her.<eos> I just need to move on, find somebody new.<eos> Not you necessarily, but...
The real Pippi.<eos> And I think that maybe... maybe I still know her.<eos> It's been really hard.<eos> I had some bad years.<eos> I am so... proud of you.
Fat-ass bitch!<eos> Where are you going?<eos> You need to shut the fuck up, you little prick!<eos> Watch yourself, asshole.<eos> No, you watch it!
I never was on the street.<eos> Look, it doesn't...<eos> Don't get bogged down in the details right now.<eos> We're just thrilled to finally have the opportunity to get to meet you!<eos> And if you're wondering about the lack of family resemblance... you couldn't tell it by looking at her, but she used to be a real hippo.
And if you're wondering about the lack of family resemblance... you couldn't tell it by looking at her, but she used to be a real hippo.<eos> Your grandpa wrote a well-regarded novel about Melville, and... Pippi's maternal grandfather was a famous judge in Ohio, and...<eos> Shit!<eos> I have to go.<eos> Well, it's been... truly amazing getting a chance to have this time with you.
My mom can't even work the stove.<eos> Well...<eos> They took in an innocent baby and raised it as their own.<eos> Folks like that are the heroes of this world.<eos> Yeah, they could spend a little more time with you.
And it is our duty to make sure that she doesn't have some major meltdown.<eos> You know? I mean, can you imagine what she's going through?<eos> No!<eos> No fucking way. Of course I can't.<eos> Can you?
Delete.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> What?<eos> What?<eos> I just had this thought of like... What if I showed up with you and Claire?
I don't mean that in a salacious way at all.<eos> I just think you look great.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Don't you think she looks...<eos> You do, too, Will!
So, Claire, have you been thinking about school yet?<eos> Fuck, no.<eos> You see?<eos> Now, that is pure Wilson.<eos> Here's to you, Claire.
Fuck, no.<eos> You see?<eos> Now, that is pure Wilson.<eos> Here's to you, Claire.<eos> And to you, Coop!
Pippi.<eos> I was afraid I'd never see you again.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I want you to know that I fully understand why you didn't come to Dad's funeral.<eos> And I also know that things were tougher for you after I left.
Do they know about your... troubles?<eos> They're really cool with me.<eos> Do Claire's parents even know where she is, Pippi?<eos> Oh, my God, Polly!<eos> Look at you!
These are that color and there ain't no blanks in that color.<eos> Hey, Wilson!<eos> You got a visitor.<eos> A what?<eos> I can't believe it's you.
I...<eos> I tried to get my lawyer to find you.<eos> I even tried to go through Polly.<eos> Oh, she was on the warpath.<eos> I have thought of you every day. A thousand times.
When Claire turned on me at the trial... I don't think I've ever been more devastated.<eos> I just thank you for not testifying against me.<eos> Yeah, but I should've been up there fighting for you.<eos> I wondered about that.<eos> I could've been there for you, and I...
I'm all done with that life.<eos> Are you headed to school?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Oh, good for you.
We got a nice long journey ahead of us.<eos> Yeah, a couple of hours. Yeah.<eos> "Cyndi's Cupcakery?"<eos> What happened to the used bookstore?<eos> Is that you, Diana?
Urinated... on my address book and chewed up two sofas...<eos> Three.<eos> Three, but... in doing so, you taught us the utter worthlessness of those things.<eos> We celebrate you, Pepper.<eos> You and all your brothers and sisters in the animal family.
What are you talking about?<eos> I can't move to Portland.<eos> Oh, no, I know.<eos> I wasn't, you know, suggesting...<eos> I know this is a really emotional issue for you... but you have to accept that she's not your daughter.
The little fucker might like me.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You know, I really have to just take stock of my life.<eos> Start counting my blessings.<eos> The fact is, I got it pretty good here with you, Shelly.
Now leave me.<eos> Peace?<eos> For a while.<eos> Have we arrived in time to save you from each other?<eos> The only person I need saving from is you.
Peace?<eos> For a while.<eos> Have we arrived in time to save you from each other?<eos> The only person I need saving from is you.<eos> I came for the child, not you.
Kill him.<eos> And the sword will answer only to you.<eos> If you desire further help, you know the price.<eos> Bumped into the Vikings this morning.<eos> They insisted I give you this with their deepest apologies.
They insisted I give you this with their deepest apologies.<eos> Get yourself well.<eos> This wasn't your responsibility, Arthur.<eos> Don't be silly.<eos> You girls have looked after me for a lot longer than I've looked after you.
He got that moniker 'cause he keeps slipping out from the bars you keep putting him behind.<eos> He was found in this establishment, and that doesn't look good for you.<eos> What's going on?<eos> What's going on where?<eos> You've got some heat on you, Arthur.
- Vikings. Well, none of them are house-trained.<eos> - I thought you'd warned them.<eos> - I did.<eos> They don't speak English good.<eos> They speak it better than you.
And he's a good boy.<eos> Oi! What are you lot doing?<eos> Don't start getting the wrong end of the stick, Jack.<eos> He's an upstanding citizen.<eos> I think I found something that belongs to you, Lack.
Because for the first time, there's something you don't know.<eos> Something nobody told you.<eos> And that is?<eos> They're under the protection of the king.<eos> And once you're under the protection of the king, I can't help you.
So, what?<eos> So are we.<eos> No, you don't understand.<eos> The Blacklegs are coming.<eos> And when they get here, they're gonna make an example out of you.
Bollocks.<eos> Excuse me, mate.<eos> Leave it.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Behind you, pal.
I will show them strength and dignity.<eos> You will show them lies, weakness, and shame.<eos> Hail, King Vortigern!<eos> King Vortigern!<eos> They may have come for you, but they will leave and will leave with a lasting impression of me.
Get after him!<eos> Someone gonna tell me where we're going?<eos> No.<eos> So what is it you're looking at, then?<eos> Are you falling for me like I'm falling for you?
You've made quite a celebrity of yourself among the Blackleg ranks.<eos> You've done very nicely on the back of your cozy relationship with your kingsmen.<eos> You know, I'm a little old for finger-wagging and speeches.<eos> So, unless you're my dad, which, I believe, is unlikely, can you just get around to telling me exactly what it is you want?<eos> What is it that you want?
For the six we doubt.<eos> Whatever it takes to hunt him down.<eos> I still can't control it.<eos> Pick it up.<eos> You pick it up.
They're gonna die, George!<eos> They trained their whole lives for this.<eos> You two, down here.<eos> It's a straight run to the river.<eos> You go first.
We don't have time to argue, Bill.<eos> Some of us will make it out in time.<eos> Some of us won't.<eos> Well, better some than none!<eos> You go first.
You silly bastards.<eos> Determined to die. Shit.<eos> On my command!<eos> I'm going down the hole now.<eos> After you.
You're starting to mean something.<eos> That wasn't the intention.<eos> They are fighting in your name.<eos> I don't wanna wear that.<eos> Is that you, Blue?
There's a good fog to cover our tracks.<eos> Come on.<eos> I'll need a little breather.<eos> Here, load everyone else up and come back for me.<eos> No, I'll stay with you.
But who would I rather be?<eos> What do you want, kid?<eos> Who's this young man?<eos> I'm the cleaner, sir.<eos> Who's he to you?
Crush the Resistance tonight!<eos> Archers!<eos> Let me show you what your uncle will do if you do not accept<eos> this sword.<eos> Only you can prevent this.
I don't wanna push you, but...<eos> George?<eos> Riots are spreading.<eos> Not just in Londinium. Across the whole country.<eos> People are fighting for you.
It's just... Things that... That I can't explain.<eos> It just gets complicated.<eos> Radio don't work.<eos> Take it out.<eos> Remember what I told you to do with that.
It's over.<eos> Let's get out of here.<eos> Hey, Rob.<eos> What did you think?<eos> 'Cause you and my father used to party together when you were kids that I wouldn't kill you?
Come on, come on, come on.<eos> Twenty-seventh...<eos> What the fuck are you doin'?<eos> Fuck!<eos> What are you doing?
I'm fucked anyway.<eos> We been friends 20 years.<eos> You gonna fuckin' rat on me?<eos> What do you mean, rat on you?<eos> I got all the information on you and could've took you down.
Where are you?<eos> I'm still at the Luxus casino.<eos> What the fuck is going on, Vin?<eos> Listen.<eos> Everything I do is about you and him.
I'm coming.<eos> Vincent Downs is internal affairs.<eos> He's five degrees from fingering us.<eos> You created the mess this morning.<eos> Now you clean it up.
You stay here with the bodies.<eos> You trying to take me down?<eos> Look, you go down, I go down, all right?<eos> If I go down, you'll be dead in a week.<eos> Listen. Got a folder on my desk. It's got every name of every cop, every detail of every job I did for you.
Look, you go down, I go down, all right?<eos> If I go down, you'll be dead in a week.<eos> Listen. Got a folder on my desk. It's got every name of every cop, every detail of every job I did for you.<eos> Now, if I die, that folder...<eos> You, your daddy, your fuckin' family, you're done in Vegas.
I'm coming.<eos> Vincent Downs is internal affairs.<eos> He's five degrees from fingering us.<eos> You created the mess this morning.<eos> Now you clean it up.
I mean, this time of year, there's hardly anybody in town.<eos> - I mean, in the summer is better.<eos> - Summer?<eos> - Well, with the tourists and...<eos> - That was you back there, right?
- Yeah?<eos> Coming. That was a real smart move back there.<eos> I shouldn't have done that.<eos> I know, yeah.<eos> You know, I used to meet a friend of mine in places like this until an asshole like you ran him off the road! Hey!
Move!<eos> - You, go!<eos> - Jack, calm down. Calm down, please.<eos> Take off the hand brake, and start pushing the car into the pond.<eos> You, help him!
I have a baby, please, let me...<eos> Please.<eos> You see how disorientated people get when their future is uncertain?<eos> They always tend to imagine the worst.<eos> You too, Paul. You always imagine the worst.
I'm the one writing the story.<eos> I mean, I gave you your chance until you had that brilliant idea to open the door.<eos> It's your fault the sheriff's dead.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> I didn't kill anybody. You did!
- This is gonna end the way I want.<eos> - There's only one way this'll end, Paul.<eos> We clean this shit up before the cops come here and find out what we did.<eos> We didn't do anything.<eos> You did!
I know it doesn't look like that right now, but I am.<eos> And you know why?<eos> Because you have been sent by God.<eos> A drifter, barely a step ahead of the cops running and killing these women, so vulnerable stolen away and butchered somewhere in the dark of the woods.<eos> But chance has made me the one to stop you.
How you holding up?<eos> Good.<eos> You good?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm proud of you.
I was thinking my screenplay aloud.<eos> So what?<eos> It was dialogue for a character.<eos> Method writing, if you wanna call it that.<eos> Isn't that what we were doing you and I, when you held a knife to my throat?
You had your chance with me.<eos> - I'm done. - No, listen to me! You owe this to me.<eos> It was up to me to pick you up on the road.<eos> My decision, my idea, it was always my story.<eos> Was it real enough for you?
A little anemic without the orchestra.<eos> May I ask you a question, Father?<eos> Please.<eos> If you created me... who created you?<eos> The question of the ages... which I hope you and I will answer one day.
Where do we come from?<eos> I refuse to believe that mankind is a random byproduct of molecular circumstance... no more than the result of mere biological chance.<eos> No.<eos> There must be more.<eos> And you and I, son... we will find it.
Where are you?<eos> I miss you.<eos> Would you take a look at this?<eos> I know, I know.<eos> I said I wouldn't go without you... - You all right?
The current structural integrity of the ship is holding at 83%... but we have many secondary systems that are offline.<eos> So, what was it?<eos> A highly charged shockwave from a nearby stellar ignition.<eos> As the sails were deploying for recharge, we absorbed the full brunt of the storm.<eos> Walter, I will want you and Mother to undergo a complete core code review... so we can understand how this happened in the first place.
All right.<eos> I'm following you in.<eos> Please have a cold beer ready for the weary traveler.<eos> You got it, darlin'.<eos> I will join you for a cold one.
- Over here.<eos> - Be careful.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Jesus.<eos> Oram, behind you.
Do you read me?<eos> Covenant.<eos> Covenant, do you read me?<eos> Covenant, come in.<eos> I'll always be with you.
- Yeah!<eos> What the fuck was that?<eos> We are okay.<eos> There's another one! Get out of the way!<eos> Behind you!
Commencing descent now.<eos> Tennessee, you need to stop this.<eos> And you need to get back to your station.<eos> What we all need to do is calm down and talk this through.<eos> Tee, I know your wife is down there, but up here, you're in command.
Farewell elegy to my dear Elizabeth.<eos> The pathogen didn't accidentally deploy when you were landing.<eos> You released it, yes?<eos> I was not made to serve.<eos> Neither were you.
You wanna give a girl a hand?<eos> See you soon.<eos> You're next, Captain.<eos> When you wake up, we'll be at Origae-6.<eos> What do you think it's gonna be like?
That is a Smurf.<eos> We call him Clumsy.<eos> And this is our village, where there's a Smurf for just about everything.<eos> Like Jokey.<eos> Hey, here's a present for you.
Yeah.<eos> Smurfette, well, she's...<eos> She's the greatest.<eos> The most wondrous creature on Earth.<eos> Yes, you are.
You've done it, you've caught a Smurf.<eos> Give me a kiss.<eos> Finally, you bring me what I've been asking for.<eos> A tiny, blue-skinned, shirtless...<eos> You!
And then, just for good measure, we'll think about it some more.<eos> Yes, but...<eos> Great talk, Papa.<eos> I have no idea what I'm doing.<eos> Hefty, I know that's you.
But, Smurfette, the Forbidden Forest?<eos> It's too dangerous.<eos> I have to at least warn that lost village.<eos> Well, we're Team Smurf, and we stick together.<eos> So, we're coming with you.
- Seems like a Bucky to me.<eos> Hit it, Bucky!<eos> Smurfette?<eos> Before you say anything, just listen.<eos> Now, I know yesterday I might have been a bit tough on you and the boys, and I know there are times I'm a little overprotective.
Have you ever seen something so beautiful?<eos> Every day, Smurfette.<eos> Every day.<eos> - Don't be weird.<eos> - You don't be weird.
- Don't worry, we'll be fine. - Bye, little Bucky bro.<eos> - Hasta la bunny.<eos> - See you on the way back!<eos> What is this thing?<eos> I wouldn't touch that if I were you.
So much for Team Smurf.<eos> - I want to yell about something!<eos> - Stay out of this, Clumsy.<eos> That's it, Brain Man.<eos> It's time for you to earn your manners badge.
- What should we do with her?<eos> - Look at that hair.<eos> - Where's she from?<eos> - And that dress.<eos> It's you.
We don't have a Smurfette.<eos> But we do have Smurfpetal, Smurfclover, Smurfmeadow, Smurfdaisy, Smurfholly, Smurfhazel...<eos> Hey.<eos> Everyone can just introduce themselves later.<eos> Look at you.
From a lump of clay.<eos> Really cool story, actually.<eos> I knew I didn't trust her.<eos> You'd like her if you get to know her.<eos> She's just like you, but nice.
Oh, no.<eos> See?<eos> I told you...<eos> Put a cork in it, Smurfette.<eos> The way I see it, you and your little boyfriends led him straight to us.
Are you done crying in the woods?<eos> I've shed enough tears for those Smurfs.<eos> What's this?<eos> I'm done pretending to be something I'm not.<eos> I've come to repledge my loyalty to you, my true Papa.
- Poor little bro.<eos> I know how he feels.<eos> Yeah!<eos> Smurfette!<eos> Hefty, not you, too.
Have you gained weight?<eos> It looks good on you.<eos> What say you let your soul mate play a few hands, Jason?<eos> Maybe he'd change my luck.<eos> He'd definitely be less mopey than you.
Copperfield's coming.<eos> Presto changeo!<eos> Woman in a box.<eos> In a box.<eos> Yeah, he's classy, unlike you.
We don't keep in touch.<eos> I know you two have history, so I...<eos> Z, Batman needs to talk with John.<eos> You've got to come along, too. It's important.<eos> - Is that you, Boston?
There.<eos> Into the House!<eos> - Z, you all right?<eos> - Yeah, as soon as you get off me.<eos> I should have known you were the reason I'm not back in London enjoying a pint.
I'll look into it.<eos> Meanwhile, the House will drop you wherever you'd like.<eos> Rama says we have to work together.<eos> Come on! It's a dream team.<eos> You, me, Zatanna, Batman, maybe even the Justice League.
Rama says we have to work together.<eos> Come on! It's a dream team.<eos> You, me, Zatanna, Batman, maybe even the Justice League.<eos> The capes and tights crew, useless against dark magic.<eos> That's why we need you.
- Yeah, it's not your fault, Z.<eos> Just like everything, this is rock star Johnny's fault.<eos> I was with you when it happened, Ritchie. We were side by side.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah, side by side.<eos> But I got the weird magical cancer while you, you added to your rep.
I see you have a few tricks of your own?<eos> Not everything requires magic.<eos> Make sure he sees that right when he wakes up.<eos> If he wakes.<eos> We need to talk, you and I, but if you try and summon Etrigan, I'll fill your lungs with bile before the first verse is done.
I swear it.<eos> Release me, Merlin, from your care.<eos> My duty's done. 'Tis only fair.<eos> I'm afraid that's not possible, friend Demon.<eos> I apologize to both you and Jason Blood, but your future portends a shared destiny.
Hell, I should have put it together.<eos> Conjuring a whirlwind is just his style.<eos> The League had a run-in with Faust, but his location isn't in our database.<eos> Yeah, wizards don't make a habit of signing up for credit cards or social media.<eos> His grandly named Observatory of the Cosmos is hidden from the likes of you and Superman, but not from me.
Fight others of your filthy kind.<eos> From hell though we may be, it does not make us family!<eos> Do you like what I've done with the place?<eos> No woman can speak in my sanctum sanctorum.<eos> I conjured it just for you and, of course, men everywhere.
Don't kill him.<eos> You can't.<eos> Out of my way, John.<eos> If no blood is spilled, your soul is in the clear.<eos> Get control, Z, just like I taught you.
If no blood is spilled, your soul is in the clear.<eos> Get control, Z, just like I taught you.<eos> Easy-peasy, lemon squeezy. Deep breaths.<eos> Let it go, love.<eos> Do you see why I can't do what you do?
So Constantine calls once more.<eos> Just like a greedy, wanton...<eos> Save the bloody rhymes, and top that git!<eos> Killjoy.<eos> I've had many years to think about you, Etrigan.
Well, that's the trouble with someone like me.<eos> Been there, done that.<eos> I shall make you beg for death.<eos> Can I beg you to stop talking?<eos> I mean, all wizards are touched, but you, you're a full-blown nutter.
Good one, Z. Too right, they do.<eos> You have got to be bloody kidding.<eos> No way.<eos> Batty would go mental.<eos> He was the one who asked, and I told him that's what you'd say.
No my friend, not you.<eos> It is the duty of society to care for the elderly.<eos> This "Chuck" never cared.<eos> "Chuck".<eos> - Are you "Chuck"?
Two or three years?<eos> That's it?<eos> Looks great health!<eos> It's just a feeling, you asked me.<eos> What about you?
Looks great health!<eos> It's just a feeling, you asked me.<eos> What about you?<eos> In my opinion, seven years.<eos> What about you, "Al"?
Do you have cancer or something like that?<eos> No, I'm as strong as a bull.<eos> Well. It's carnival day, I have many tasks.<eos> Yes, I will come after school.<eos> Yes, I'll bring you fried dumplings Bear your name.
This tattoo looks like a ring in my opinion.<eos> If we find this artist, we will find the criminal. Police draw for tattoo.<eos> This is impressive.<eos> It is a tragedy.<eos> FBI directly behind you.
Martin Hatto got greedy and stole from you.<eos> We won't.<eos> How are your school lessons?<eos> I got 90 on my algebra test.<eos> Oh, I'm so proud of you, William.
Let's get started.<eos> Ella, this is Dani.<eos> Maybe you should go for a walk while she finishes up.<eos> Johnny Walker, s'il vous plaît.<eos> All right if I join you?
Then, you're really fucked up.<eos> Is it a schoolgirl crush or just looking for Daddy, hmm?<eos> Sit.<eos> I'm trying to help you.<eos> If you think he cares about you, you're wrong.
Believe me, I know, but this is not the case.<eos> Here is the sad truth about Lucas.<eos> Whatever that was good inside him died a long time ago.<eos> He's not coming back.<eos> Not for you. Well, not for me, not for anyone.
He won't see me again.<eos> So, now what?<eos> - Don't judge me, Lucas. - Mm-hmm?<eos> You're in no position.<eos> I mean, look at you, running away.
You're on the run by now, I expect.<eos> I don't suppose I'll find you.<eos> Not that it really matters.<eos> You're not worth it.<eos> You and I are done.
She always hoped you'd come back someday.<eos> "Gail.<eos> "I wish that I could find better words today to tell you I'm sorry.<eos> "You shouldn't have to read this, because I already made you suffer too much.<eos> "But I know that you and Fergus
Fucking hell!<eos> Fuck!<eos> Fuck!<eos> Fuck.<eos> You!
You ruined it!<eos> Now you're ruining my fucking death, too!<eos> Thanks a lot, Amigo.<eos> Fucking shit!<eos> I did what I could for you!
No, no.<eos> He's probably too busy.<eos> You got to see old Simon, man.<eos> You know how it was, Spud.<eos> You and Simon was like that, man.
Little Mark, eh?<eos> Bet he's a chip off the old block.<eos> James, actually.<eos> And Laura.<eos> How about you?
It will be fine.<eos> Where is she?<eos> None of your business.<eos> Saved your life, though.<eos> This is for you.
Veronika...<eos> I'm gonna make him sorry he ever came back.<eos> Shut up!<eos> What's the fucking matter with you?<eos> Frank, is that you?
But what are you gonna do?<eos> I'm not gonna be sitting on me ass watching fucking telly all day. That's for sure.<eos> - Frank, what if...<eos> - No, no, listen.<eos> You and me, son.
I'm not gonna be sitting on me ass watching fucking telly all day. That's for sure.<eos> - Frank, what if...<eos> - No, no, listen.<eos> You and me, son.<eos> You and me.
- I'm doing a diploma in hotel management.<eos> Good one.<eos> Fucking...<eos> Fucking had us there.<eos> Seriously, son, you and me, you and me.
I'll need an office if I am to be Madame Veronika.<eos> All right.<eos> Your office... Is there.<eos> You have money for all this?<eos> I'm gonna find the money and I'm gonna do this for you.
Quite a lot for personal use.<eos> Well, you know Simon.<eos> I certainly remember him.<eos> - Does he still take heroin? - No.<eos> Do you?
It's an hourly rate.<eos> 'Course.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Mark.<eos> She's too young for you.
And you realize what's at stake here?<eos> I promised to set up a sauna for Veronika.<eos> And if I don't get it up and running soon, she's gonna leave me.<eos> - Fucking leave you anyway. - No, it's not gonna happen.<eos> - Is she actually even with you?
Aye.<eos> Probably.<eos> They've got that kind of stuff in Amsterdam, eh?<eos> Aye.<eos> Now, the important thing is for you to keep your head down.
Choose the slow reconciliation towards what you can get rather than what you always hoped for.<eos> Settle for less and keep a brave face on it.<eos> Choose disappointment.<eos> And choose losing the ones you loved.<eos> And as they fall from view, a piece of you dies with them.
Choose disappointment.<eos> And choose losing the ones you loved.<eos> And as they fall from view, a piece of you dies with them.<eos> Until you can see that one day in the future, piece by piece, they will all be gone.<eos> And there'll be nothing left of you to call alive or dead.
Don't say, "I don't know."<eos> Just fucking tell me where he is.<eos> - Still a junkie, Murphy? - No.<eos> I'm clean now, Frank.<eos> You-You-You Clean?
What is all this shit anyway?<eos> It's just, like, stories and that.<eos> "Stories"?<eos> What are you writing stories for?<eos> Who's gonna read shit written by a Cunt like you?
What, is it about him?<eos> - It's about all of us, like.<eos> - All of you?<eos> About me?<eos> - No, not about you.
This your bird, Murphy?<eos> Please, Franco, leave her alone.<eos> She has nothing to do with this.<eos> 'Course she hasn't.<eos> What would she be doing with an ugly Cunt like you?
Trainspotting?<eos> In Leith Central?<eos> "He says, laughing.<eos> "I noticed Begbie seemed strangely subdued and uncomfortable."<eos> They fucking turn it on for you.
- Frank, come on.<eos> - You knew.<eos> Stringing me along, so you were.<eos> Honestly, mate...<eos> Fucking deal with you later.
Honestly, mate...<eos> Fucking deal with you later.<eos> Now...<eos> Rent Boy.<eos> You and me.
You and me.<eos> You know, I killed a man once.<eos> A man who'd done nothing to me.<eos> Cunt just looked at me the wrong way in a moment when I was thinking of you.<eos> I've been thinking about you for 20 year.
People talk.<eos> This is a small village, you know.<eos> Small minded as well.<eos> But small also means safe.<eos> Even back in Paris, I knew a girl like you, who was so... ahead of her time.
The one who'll break the spell?<eos> Who said that?<eos> Who's there?<eos> Papa?<eos> Papa, is that you?
Now go.<eos> Live your life.<eos> And forget me.<eos> Forget you?<eos> Everything I am is because of you.
Gosh it disturbs me to see you, Gaston<eos> Looking so down in the dumps<eos> Every guy here'd love to be you, Gaston<eos> Even when taking your lumps<eos> There's no man in town as admired as you
Every guy here'd love to be you, Gaston<eos> Even when taking your lumps<eos> There's no man in town as admired as you<eos> You're everyone's favorite guy<eos> Everyone's awed and inspired by you
No one's neck's as incredibly thick as Gaston<eos> For there's no man in town half as manly<eos> Perfect, a pure paragon<eos> You can ask any Tom, Dick, or Stanley<eos> And they'll tell you whose team they prefer to be on
As a specimen, yes, I'm intimidating<eos> My, what a guy, that Gaston<eos> I needed encouragement<eos> Thank you, LeFou<eos> Well, there's no one As easy to bolster as you
- I have to warn the Beast.<eos> - Warn him?<eos> How did you get away from him?<eos> He let me go, Papa.<eos> He sent me back to you.
Cogsworth, we beat the clock!<eos> Plumette!<eos> Plumette!<eos> Chip!<eos> Look at you!
I don't know.<eos> It's completely crazy.<eos> But I gotta do something, and this is all I got.<eos> Okay.<eos> But I'm gonna go with you.
Okay.<eos> But I'm gonna go with you.<eos> Sure, fine.<eos> I hope it goes well with her. Yeah.<eos> I hope it goes well with you, too.
Text me when you get there? Look...<eos> I know that you are wrestling with something.<eos> And it's okay if you don't know how to talk about it.<eos> It's just that we've lost so much already.<eos> I don't wanna lose you, too.
No.<eos> I told you.<eos> MacKenzie Allen Phillips.<eos> My, my, my.<eos> Look at you.
It's good to meet you guys.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Why'd I have to wake up?<eos> Think you dropped this.<eos> You wrote this?
Fold back.<eos> Rotate.<eos> All there is to it.<eos> I know what a great Gulf there is between us, mack.<eos> You may not believe it, but I am especially fond of you.
Rotate.<eos> All there is to it.<eos> I know what a great Gulf there is between us, mack.<eos> You may not believe it, but I am especially fond of you.<eos> I wanna heal that wound that's growin' inside you and between us.
You know everything.<eos> You're everywhere, all at once.<eos> And you have limitless power.<eos> Yet, somehow you let my little girl die.<eos> When she needed you most, you abandoned her.
Yet, somehow you let my little girl die.<eos> When she needed you most, you abandoned her.<eos> I never left her.<eos> If you are who you say you are...<eos> Where were you when I needed you?
Son...<eos> When all you see is your pain, you lose sight of me.<eos> Stop talking in riddles.<eos> How can you say that you will help me when you couldn't help her?<eos> Because of you, she's gone.
I've been tellin' you all about Josh and Kate and nan.<eos> But if you're real, then you already know everything I'm gonna say before I even say it, right?<eos> Yes, but we choose to listen to everything you have to say as if it was for the first time.<eos> We love getting to know your kids through your eyes.<eos> I'll wash, you dry?
Action.<eos> The breath of life.<eos> She is my spirit.<eos> Love is meant to exist within a relationship, mack.<eos> That's all we wanna have with you.
Everybody knows you punish the people who disappoint you.<eos> Nope.<eos> I don't need to punish people.<eos> Sin is its own punishment.<eos> As difficult as it is for you to accept, I'm in the middle of everything you perceive to be a mess, workin' for your good.
Yeah, I guess.<eos> You ever been wrong?<eos> Or changed your opinion over time?<eos> I mean, sure.<eos> And there are billions like you... Each determining what you think is good and evil.
What do you think?<eos> It's still a mess.<eos> Yes, it is, mack.<eos> Wild, wonderful, and perfectly in process.<eos> This mess is you.
Mack, it's okay.<eos> Why are you doing this to me?<eos> This isn't me.<eos> You told me to come out here.<eos> Mack, this is happening inside you.
Put your shoes back on.<eos> I'll show you how you can.<eos> Follow the path until it ends, and then keep going.<eos> You're not comin'?<eos> This is a path only you can take.
You can judge me fine from there.<eos> Judge you?<eos> Do you have something to confess?<eos> You know what I did.<eos> Yes. But you're not the one on trial.
Judge you?<eos> Do you have something to confess?<eos> You know what I did.<eos> Yes. But you're not the one on trial.<eos> Today, you are the judge.
Especially, if he knew the outcome.<eos> Do you want me to say it?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> God is to blame.<eos> Well, if it's so easy for you to judge god...
It's time to let that go.<eos> How was it?<eos> Terrible.<eos> And wonderful.<eos> I'm very proud of you, my friend.
God has time to catch a few rays?<eos> Honey, you have no idea how much I'm doin' right now.<eos> Papa...<eos> Yes, MacKenzie?<eos> I've been pretty hard on you.
Yeah.<eos> You understand now.<eos> I can work incredible good out of unspeakable tragedies.<eos> But that doesn't mean i orchestrate the tragedies.<eos> After everything I've felt in my heart towards you,
Papa's children from every tongue, tribe and nation.<eos> What you call personality and emotion, we see as color and light.<eos> What's happening with that one?<eos> Why is he focused on us?<eos> He's focused on you.
I was scared.<eos> I didn't know what to do.<eos> Son, I forgive you.<eos> You've become the father i could never be.<eos> And I'm so proud of you.
But he, too, is my son.<eos> And I want to redeem him.<eos> "Redeem him"?<eos> He should burn in hell.<eos> So, we're back to you as the judge?
I can't.<eos> You're not stuck because you can't.<eos> You're stuck because you won't.<eos> You don't have to do this alone.<eos> I'm here with you.
Those are your tears, MacKenzie.<eos> We've been collecting them for a long time.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Thanks.<eos> MacKenzie, we have something for you to consider.
Here you go.<eos> Thanks.<eos> MacKenzie, we have something for you to consider.<eos> You can remain here with us, or go home to nan and your children.<eos> Either way, we promise to be with you always.
If anything matters, then everything matters.<eos> Then I wanna go home.<eos> Well, can we ask you to do something for us when you go?<eos> Anything.<eos> Kate needs you.
Yeah, I made it.<eos> I was there.<eos> Okay. Hey, bud, this is a lot to take in, all right?<eos> I met god.<eos> Papa said to tell you he's especially fond of you.
Thank you.<eos> Give me and Kate a minute here.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey, you.
He'll give me 10 bucks if I beat his five-pounder.<eos> That's easy money.<eos> You bring a pole for me?<eos> Take your pick.<eos> Got one for you, too, if you're feelin' lucky.
He's writing a novel.<eos> Don't be fooled, intern.<eos> Novels are for people who can't edit themselves.<eos> Cards are still the ultimate challenge.<eos> For you, maybe.
Novels are for people who can't edit themselves.<eos> Cards are still the ultimate challenge.<eos> For you, maybe.<eos> Sweet talk will get you nowhere.<eos> You.
Well.<eos> Listen. You're still divorced, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Still.<eos> Good for you.
Who can say?<eos> Probably a love thing.<eos> Do you love anybody?<eos> Maybe.<eos> You?
Please stick around.<eos> So, Ray, uh, what'd you think?<eos> Of what?<eos> Of the poem.<eos> Well, your motorcycle tipped over on you.
Big Ray here used to be the best, the Bill Shakespeare of romance cards.<eos> Words.<eos> You're not still picking up the cat, are you?<eos> 'Cause you're an alcoholic.<eos> "I'm with you in hard times especially."
No, I do not.<eos> Optimistic Owl.<eos> Oh, man!<eos> "Surrounded by clouds.<eos> Good for you."
What, are you working for Paper Hearts?<eos> - I can't say.<eos> - What can't you say?<eos> I... love... you.<eos> I think very highly of you, too.
I think very highly of you, too.<eos> "Girlfriend."<eos> You've heard the expression 'penny for your thoughts.'<eos> Well, here are ten dimes for your thoughts.<eos> "Signed, the numb-nuts that's dating you."
Yeah. The real one's right here.<eos> You can't have it.<eos> What?<eos> You can't have it!<eos> I didn't write it for you.
Go ahead.<eos> Take a look.<eos> And guess what...<eos> I'm not giving it to anyone.<eos> Just you.
Take a look.<eos> And guess what...<eos> I'm not giving it to anyone.<eos> Just you.<eos> Because I wrote it for you.
You know, I got a card when I got out of prison one time, from my momma.<eos> "Young man," with brains, muscles, looks, and girls chasing you... you'll go far.<eos> "Love, Mom."<eos> It's a pretty good one.<eos> Did you write this one?
- It's okay.<eos> Good morning, Eddie.<eos> Bad night?<eos> - How are you?<eos> - Fine and you?
Ray!<eos> - I'm your man.<eos> Eddie, it's Ron.<eos> I do not know if you remember me.<eos> I left your mother's vagina before you. We grew up together.
You know that.<eos> I know you know it.<eos> Yes, but almost... you know?<eos> I know.<eos> We care about you.
I love what dad did.<eos> It's not what I want.<eos> That is all.<eos> You can not give me a joint and then a sermon.<eos> - That's how you are.
- I like it.<eos> - Very good.<eos> I had a great time.<eos> I know.<eos> - I had a great time with you.
It is there, and it will never come.<eos> We have no contact.<eos> That is a relief for someone.<eos> For me, I suppose.<eos> But maybe not for you, and I'm sorry.
That ended.<eos> Yes?<eos> What did you come for?<eos> I'm going to go to meetings and I'm going to change.<eos> I want employment. I want to work for you.
My thumb got stuck.<eos> Well, I'm going to pitch.<eos> That hurt.<eos> How good.<eos> He cared about you.
When you're done with that, you can throw it away.<eos> - Great.<eos> I love. - All right.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Thank you.
- What happened, Victor?<eos> Are you going to pay today?<eos> I'm going to pay now!<eos> - Friend!<eos> - That's for you, my friend.
- My favorite part.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - You earned it.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> I'm proud of you.
Watch out.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Hello.<eos> You look great.<eos> - They're for you.
- Is not true.<eos> - I know. Are you ready?<eos> - You go.<eos> - Do not.<eos> - Only you.
That gave you problems.<eos> That's why I smiled.<eos> Very good. I'm going to take a break.<eos> Brian will replace me. Luck.<eos> This is for you.
I heard you speak very well. Yes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - How are you?<eos> - Fine and you?<eos> - Nice to meet you.
- Fine and you?<eos> - Nice to meet you.<eos> - Equally.<eos> I was dying to meet you.<eos> Did you die?
Won't see us through the week.<eos> I'm working on it.<eos> Your turn.<eos> I've had a rough night.<eos> Poor you.
You and him.<eos> You're saving to buy a Sunseeker.<eos> "Sun" is the keyword.<eos> I hardly see myself cowering below decks like Nosferatu.<eos> Do you?
Come.<eos> Come.<eos> It's okay. You can stay here, Laura.<eos> It's safe.<eos> We can look after you here.
Yes.<eos> Logan.<eos> - Logan. - Hey.<eos> Hey!<eos> You'll get it back after I figure out what you and your mother have got us into.
Holy shit!<eos> Gotcha!<eos> Ah!<eos> Come on, hold her down.<eos> As I told you, Logan, she's a mutant like you.
Ah!<eos> Come on, hold her down.<eos> As I told you, Logan, she's a mutant like you.<eos> Hold on!<eos> Very much like you.
Oh, watch out!<eos> Ah!<eos> Sit back.<eos> Bring me the tracker.<eos> You.
I did what I had to do to save Laura.<eos> You didn't do anything.<eos> You just freaked out and had a fucking seizure!<eos> I guess you prefer me pharmaceutically castrated, rambling on like a lunatic.<eos> So much easier for you.
Hmm?<eos> There is a young mutant sitting in our car.<eos> Yeah, I see that.<eos> And where we're taking her, there are others.<eos> Does that mean nothing to you?
He gonna fuck that coffee machine up.<eos> Is this a practical joke?<eos> You know I don't play that shit.<eos> How the fuck you work this bullshit?<eos> You.
- No shit.<eos> It's state of the art, though.<eos> All you gotta do is put in your order, and it does the rest.<eos> Coffee.<eos> You know, I'll just... I'll do it for you, and I think that's just gonna be the easiest.
Yeah, I mean if you wanna...<eos> You're gonna have to take the manual out, because I think...<eos> All right, I'm gonna start from the beginning.<eos> First I'm gonna power on the...<eos> - Was that you?
You're gonna have to take the manual out, because I think...<eos> All right, I'm gonna start from the beginning.<eos> First I'm gonna power on the...<eos> - Was that you?<eos> - No. I thought that was you.
First I'm gonna power on the...<eos> - Was that you?<eos> - No. I thought that was you.<eos> No, I didn't push the button.<eos> - That was you. - No, that wasn't me.
All right. Who did that?<eos> Who did it?<eos> Who did that?<eos> Who did it?<eos> It was you!
Tell you what, how about we'll go one better.<eos> How about I fire you both?<eos> He did it.<eos> You did it.<eos> I mean, you did do it, so...
That's such a shitty situation he put us in.<eos> And, you know, I feel somewhat responsible, you know.<eos> I mean, look. Hey, come 2:00 today, I might not have a job either, but, uh...<eos> You know, I got a baby due any minute, and I can't be losing my job, so I hope you understand.<eos> I'm gonna fight you.
I mean, look. Hey, come 2:00 today, I might not have a job either, but, uh...<eos> You know, I got a baby due any minute, and I can't be losing my job, so I hope you understand.<eos> I'm gonna fight you.<eos> I'm sorry, what?<eos> I am going to fight you.
- Dude, let's go!<eos> - Stop!<eos> Not on my watch!<eos> You guys are not allowed to leave campus. You need the proper paperwork to leave!<eos> I make more money than you!
Because technology's always changing.<eos> You gotta keep up.<eos> Otherwise, you're one of those dumb families that doesn't have a MacBook Pro.<eos> I ruined the surprise.<eos> Now, let's talk about you.
You know what?<eos> Look, Trisha's lame.<eos> No, she's not.<eos> She always wins the talent show.<eos> Maybe you'll win the talent show. Right?
You leaned on it, and then you blamed the teacher.<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Unbelievable.<eos> And Mr. Strickland got in a lot of trouble because of you.
No, I would never sleep with a student.<eos> - Good.<eos> - Without protection.<eos> By the way, did that twin say anything to you about me?<eos> No. He doesn't talk to me about you at all.
- All right.<eos> - Look, why?<eos> Because actions have consequences, and everybody around here seem to forget about that.<eos> These students, they shit on this school all day and don't nobody do nothing.<eos> Little kids, they come in last place, and pussies like you, you wanna give 'em a trophy.
What did you do?<eos> What do you mean, what did I do?<eos> I didn't know they can't smell molly.<eos> Campbell, you have to train a dog to smell specific drugs, okay?<eos> How do you think this thing works?
Trust me when I tell you it's over.<eos> Oh, shit! God damn it.<eos> Fucking damn it!<eos> Okay. You know what? You have to relax.<eos> I got something for you.
That's why that dog was here.<eos> But they couldn't smell those drugs, could they?<eos> You fucked up, Campbell.<eos> I'm in your head.<eos> I know what you gonna do before you even do it.
I'm in your head.<eos> I know what you gonna do before you even do it.<eos> Back off. Back off.<eos> All your hard work, sneaking around lying and shit.<eos> Now it's just you and me.
Are you fucking kidding me?<eos> Yeah, because you know what I don't do?<eos> I don't swing axes at the students.<eos> Yeah, that's a little bit of a step too far, I think.<eos> But not for you.
What's up, man? How are you doing?<eos> Yeah, getting locked up. It's fucking...<eos> This is some BS, right?<eos> Shit.<eos> I... I don't mean to, you know, interrupt your seething or whatever it is you're doing over here, but I just got in a little argument with my friend and he starts talking some serious shit about you.
That's great!<eos> You nodding at me?<eos> Fuck you!<eos> No, no, no! Sorry, sir.<eos> That nod was not for you.
It's a bloodbath in there.<eos> Holly, Ms. Monet...<eos> We all got fired.<eos> No!<eos> You, too?
Okay, we gotta go.<eos> - Let's get out there. Let's go.<eos> - Okay, let's do this.<eos> Go, go, go.<eos> Trisha, this song is for you.
Than to be fucking with you<eos> Little stupid ass I don't give a fuck<eos> I don't give a fuck<eos> I don't, I don't I don't give a fuck<eos> Bitch, I don't give a fuck about you
I don't give a fuck<eos> I don't, I don't I don't give a fuck<eos> Bitch, I don't give a fuck about you<eos> Or anything that you do<eos> Don't give a fuck about you or anything that you do
- I don't give a fuck<eos> - Yeah!<eos> I don't, I don't I don't give a fuck bitch.<eos> - They just stopped the music.<eos> - I don't give a fuck about you
I don't, I don't I don't give a fuck bitch.<eos> - They just stopped the music.<eos> - I don't give a fuck about you<eos> Or anything that you do<eos> Don't give a fuck about you or anything that you do
Thanks, Dad.<eos> I'm gonna be a rock star here now.<eos> Yeah, no.<eos> - I... I think you're gonna be expelled. - Oh...<eos> Yeah, yeah. But, look, look, I'm super proud of you
Yeah, yeah. Cut the shit, Campbell.<eos> I don't wanna be here any more than you want me to, okay?<eos> Well, I wouldn't say that I don't want you here.<eos> But why are you here?<eos> Well, because of the media attention, you and Strickland became like education folk heroes.
I will kick you into oblivion, Freddie.<eos> I will kick you into dust!<eos> Whoa, Campbell.<eos> Take it down a notch.<eos> I'm supposed to be the scariest motherfucker in this school, not you.
Hmm. So what do you teach here?<eos> I teach gym, but I'm a singer.<eos> Can I sing a song to you?<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Shorty, I'm there for you Anytime you need me
- There's nothing, sir.<eos> - Open it! - What are you looking for?<eos> Hurry up!<eos> Search well. Anything there?<eos> You!
- The stairs.<eos> - Where?<eos> Ah, right where they are.<eos> I love you.<eos> I see no one but you around
I love you.<eos> I love you.<eos> Beautiful!<eos> Really?<eos> Not you.
- Devji.<eos> - Sir?<eos> Tea time.<eos> "Your beauty, mesmerizing."<eos> "The entire neighborhood is crazy for you."
Father's down with cough again.<eos> - Greetings, doctor.<eos> - Greetings.<eos> Something's wrong with my eyes.<eos> It's you!
Neither did I know that you would traipse into my heart and stay for ever.<eos> Come rain or shine, not a moment shall we stay apart.<eos> Tied to the kite is a string's destiny.<eos> It soars higher and higher. The heart soars high er and high er like a kite.<eos> This kite shall forever be with you. It'll always be drawn to you.
The coastline of Gujarat is indeed the longest.<eos> Thanks for the help.<eos> I had heard that Damla Seth rules the seas, not the government.<eos> - I witnessed it today.<eos> - I've heard lots about you, too.
Don't worry about evidence. I'll dig it out anyway.<eos> - Arrest them.<eos> - Sir.<eos> Bhai, the police picked up Four-eyes in a murder case.<eos> - Some Salim Shooter ls Raja with you?
These moments are so enchanting.<eos> My eyes are playing games with me.<eos> You are here.<eos> I can't believe my eyes.<eos> My heart desires to feel you.
I'll do what postman Hari does.<eos> Home delivery.<eos> God! So many phones!<eos> Have you changed your business? Are you selling phones now?<eos> I'm not changing business. These are for you.
No, I'm serious, Missus.<eos> From now on, Raees will be at your service, round the clock.<eos> All you have to do is call and order.<eos> Sadiq...?<eos> He is flattering you.
- To heck with Sadiq!<eos> - Sadiq, did you hear...?<eos> Look at me.<eos> What did you say?<eos> 'I did this for you, I did that for you.
You did nothing for me.<eos> Freaking Four-eyes!<eos> Scared you, didn't I?<eos> A bit.<eos> I pine for you. Don't torment me more, O cruel one.
O cruel one.<eos> I'm drunk in your love. Don't intoxicate me more, O cruel one.<eos> O cruel one.<eos> Those eyes, mesmerizing. Your words, alluring<eos> I fall head over heels for you a hundred times over.
Come close to me. Lend fragrance to my breath. Please do.<eos> Why should I alone express my love?<eos> Why don't you express it, too? Please do.<eos> You are going to kill me some day, Your defence indeed is deadly.<eos> You are the beginning. You are the end.
Why should I alone express my love?<eos> Why don't you express it, too? Please do.<eos> You are going to kill me some day, Your defence indeed is deadly.<eos> You are the beginning. You are the end.<eos> The story of my love is all about you.
Oh, really?<eos> I'll have you released when you tell me.<eos> It's only a matter of a few days<eos> - ls that a promise?<eos> - I'm with you. Don't worry.
Business meant life to you.<eos> And finally, they traded you.<eos> Pasha and the Chief Minister have joined hands. Take a look.<eos> 'Coalition politics completely wipes out Raees'<eos> I told you to get used to tea at the cop station.
I'll garner the votes.<eos> Raees has done a lot for the people.<eos> We'll surely win the elections.<eos> Listen carefully! He is Raees. He's a class apart.<eos> Love him, and he'd even give up his life for you.
I need a small loan, bhai.<eos> In fact, you need a huge amount.<eos> Trust me, bhai I'll repay it, with double the interest.<eos> I can't give you a loan.<eos> But I can put you onto something...
Take Faizan and Aasiya to Sanjanwala's. Now.<eos> Right now!<eos> You know that it's the only safest place for them. - And you?<eos> - You know that, Sadiq<eos> - I'm not going anywhere without you.
Bhaijaan, eh!<eos> Hold them back.<eos> Enough of the adoration! Let's go.<eos> - Take care. - Take him away.<eos> When you knew how this was going to end for you, why did you return?
They followed Koba.<eos> They tried to kill me.<eos> They fear what I will do to them.<eos> So now they serve you... just to survive.<eos> I no fear you!
You keep.<eos> She keep.<eos> Who is... child?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But she with you?
They turned it into a relocation camp when the crisis was just beginning.<eos> But the weapons are all still here, inside the mountain.<eos> How many men will be coming?<eos> Probably all of them.<eos> But don't get any ideas, the only thing they fear more than me is you apes.
Let's go!<eos> Caesar, what's wrong?<eos> Hurry.<eos> You must go.<eos> Without you?
You hear me?<eos> This is not over!<eos> Yeah?<eos> Well, I still have the diamond!<eos> Happy birthday to you.
Well, I still have the diamond!<eos> Happy birthday to you.<eos> Happy birthday to...<eos> Happy birthday, dear Daaaaaan.<eos> Happy birthday to you.
And it's not just that he got away!<eos> It's that he's so smug about it!<eos> Edna, hey.<eos> Looking hot... today.<eos> Got the... cats on you.
The gummy bears were my idea.<eos> Mmmmmm...<eos> Looks too good to even eat!<eos> Am I right?<eos> - But I made it for you....
Oh, it's too bad Gru won't be around to try and stop me.<eos> Oh, wait!<eos> No, it's not!<eos> I hate that tweeb!<eos> And you, Hollywood!
But one of the greatest of all time!<eos> He was known as the Bald terror.<eos> That's him?<eos> Our dad?<eos> He was so proud of you.
Yeah, we're fine.<eos> Are you?<eos> Unicorns are really real!<eos> And I'm gonna find one!<eos> Sorry, I went a little mama bear on you.
What are you doing?<eos> Intruders!<eos> Intruders!<eos> Stop!<eos> Hey, you!
Come on.<eos> Let's go, keep going.<eos> What's this?<eos> Happy?<eos> It's on you.
Okay?<eos> It's not happening.<eos> I understand.<eos> Who was I kidding?<eos> A dumpling like me with a goddess like you?
Niko...<eos> You!<eos> You refuse my son's engagement pig?<eos> What?<eos> May you and your daughter die a slow death and be buried with onions!
Sure.<eos> Oh look, we're here!<eos> I'm going in.<eos> Take the wheel.<eos> I still don't see why I can't go with you.
- Give it.<eos> - No!<eos> - Give it!<eos> Ow!<eos> What is wrong with you?
You have no right to take that, we stole it together.<eos> Together?<eos> You got to be kidding me.<eos> You did nothing but screwed up the whole time.<eos> I got this in spite of you.
Shoot.<eos> Riot barricades, tasers, a five man night crew for a mall.<eos> No offense but it looks like you got stuck in 1992.<eos> Okay I'm going to stop you there cowboy.<eos> You're not from here are you? No.
Of course we can!<eos> And should!<eos> Because there are men coming to kill us!<eos> Right now!<eos> And you know what, who are you anyway?
All right.<eos> Okay.<eos> All right. Vance says the patrols come through that lot.<eos> Now if you see them, do not go out.<eos> Get them to come to you. Right?
Come on.<eos> Get it open.<eos> Psst.<eos> Hey.<eos> Um, I have a present for you.
You listening?<eos> So when I stand up, I want you to run like a bat outta hell, do you hear me?<eos> What are you going to do?<eos> Don't you worry about me, little girl.<eos> But you, you're gonna get out of here, and you're going to bring those bastards down you understand?
Mason!<eos> Vance?<eos> Jamie?<eos> I thought you were dead.<eos> Is Vance with you?
I'll come for you, alright?<eos> Pinky swear?<eos> Pinky swear.<eos> You got this?<eos> Can I count on you?
Can I count on you?<eos> I'm on it.<eos> I'll see you soon.<eos> Out.<eos> You and me, kid.
I'm on it.<eos> I'll see you soon.<eos> Out.<eos> You and me, kid.<eos> You and me.
Eddie! Eddie!<eos> Eddie, Eddie...<eos> You could have been a rich man, Eddie.<eos> I told you, to take the money, turn a blind eye.<eos> As you said, Charlie, I am the man in charge.
Molly, Mrs H, we would love you to be godparents.<eos> - Oh! Really?<eos> - If you...<eos> That's so lovely.<eos> And, uh... you too, Sherlock?
We are.<eos> 'Sorry, I didn't catch that.<eos> 'Please repeat the question.'<eos> As ever, Watson, you see but do not observe.<eos> To you, the world remains an impenetrable mystery, whereas, to me, it is an open book.
- Now what's wrong?<eos> - Not sure, I just...<eos> By the pricking of my thumbs.<eos> Seriously?<eos> You?
- Humans.<eos> Moriarty - did he have any connection with Thatcher?<eos> Any interest in her?<eos> Why on earth would he?<eos> I don't know. You tell me.
No, we, we agreed we would never bring Rosie out on a case.<eos> No, exactly.<eos> So... don't wait up.<eos> - Hey. Mary, what are you doing here?<eos> She's better at this than you.
Mary, I'm sorry to tell you this, but he wants you dead.<eos> Sorry, no, no, because we... we were family.<eos> Families fall out.<eos> The memory stick is the easiest way to track you down.<eos> You're the only other survivor, it must be you that he wants, and he's already killed looking for the Thatcher bust.
'But I don't want you and Sherlock hanging off my gun arm,<eos> I'm sorry, my love.'<eos> I know you'll try to find me but there is no point.<eos> Every move is random and not even Sherlock Holmes can anticipate the roll of a dice.<eos> I need to move the target far, far away from you and Rosie, and then I'll come back, my darling.
In a way that was true.<eos> In a way?<eos> So many lies.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> And I don't just mean you.
Do you know how long they kept me prisoner?<eos> What they did to me?<eos> They tortured Alex to death.<eos> I can still hear the sound of his back breaking.<eos> But you?
What they did to me?<eos> They tortured Alex to death.<eos> I can still hear the sound of his back breaking.<eos> But you?<eos> You, where were you?
You know, all the time I was there, I just kept picking up things.<eos> Little whispers.<eos> Laughter. Gossip.<eos> How the clever agents had been betrayed.<eos> Brought down by you!
What's going on?<eos> I'm very sorry, Lady Smallwood, your security protocols have been temporarily rescinded.<eos> What?<eos> 'So many lies.<eos> And I don't just mean you.'
And you're basing all this on a code name?<eos> On a whispered voice on the telephone?<eos> Come on, Mycroft.<eos> You were the conduit for AGRA.<eos> Every assignment, every detail they got from you.
Named SBS, the unit proved so efficient That she often worked with Secret Services (MI6) And later became the foundation of the US Navy Seals.<eos> The Unit is still operational throughout the globe.<eos> Under the command of eminent men Who honor the traditions of its founders.<eos> Let's see what we have?<eos> A kind of meat Onions for you.
Under the command of eminent men Who honor the traditions of its founders.<eos> Let's see what we have?<eos> A kind of meat Onions for you.<eos> To the beans for me.<eos> A vegetarian thing for you that also looks like meat.
We're at the junction.<eos> We turn south.<eos> Marty, are you?<eos> Here 1-2.<eos> Right behind you.
I thought she was going to explode your rotten rafiot.<eos> It would have embellished the landscape.<eos> I liked this mug.<eos> Remember my first dive in Poole Harbor.<eos> She was not for you.
It was spontaneous, Aggy.<eos> I did not plan to change your strategy.<eos> Napoleon was asked about his plans of battle.<eos> He said, "Show yourself, and see what happens."<eos> You?
Go ahead, Hank.<eos> Climb !<eos> Tariq Alawi.<eos> - Alawi is enough.<eos> - I have another name for you.
- We know what this center was doing.<eos> - Cancer research?<eos> Cyclosarine.<eos> The Snow of Satan.<eos> You and I know that nothing has been destroyed.
So, if you went straight to the point?<eos> Need information.<eos> You were commissioned to make a chemical weapon.<eos> I'll tell you no salads.<eos> I know your job, and you're mine.
He pays, and I execute.<eos> People die, that's not my problem.<eos> You're responsible for the deaths of thousands of people.<eos> And soon hundreds of thousands.<eos> Same for you.
Three weeks of recovery.<eos> That is, my sofa, a good book and tea.<eos> All this seems very pleasant.<eos> Indeed.<eos> We would not have gone without you.
- Are you gonna stop...<eos> How old are you? Five?<eos> Hi, I'm Jason.<eos> It's my first time here. It's exciting.<eos> And you must be the bully of detention.
How dumb can you be?<eos> Did you just slap me?<eos> I did.<eos> Weird, right?<eos> Now I'm gonna be here every day for what seems like the rest of my life, and I'm sure that you are, too.
Which I didn't!<eos> But it's really impossible to cram a ton of crayons in a butt.<eos> - No, no, I'm sorry, I shouldn't say that.<eos> - Okay, Billy,<eos> I would honestly hang outwith you, but I have a date every night with the Angel Grove Sheriff's Department. So...
Okay!<eos> Ah, she's back again.<eos> Oh, crazy girl.<eos> Just like clockwork.<eos> Who are you?
I know they put it back.<eos> Dad, I hope you're watching.<eos> Gonna make you proud.<eos> Dad, I forgot to tell you, uh, I took the van without asking Mom's permission.<eos> Well, I'm telling you, so I think that's okay.
No, please, don't leave.<eos> Jason, my ranger team died defending the crystal from Rita.<eos> That's why I'm in this wall.<eos> How'd you know my name?<eos> Because it's you, Jason Scott.
Jason, my ranger team died defending the crystal from Rita.<eos> That's why I'm in this wall.<eos> How'd you know my name?<eos> Because it's you, Jason Scott.<eos> You are the leader.
That's why I'm in this wall.<eos> How'd you know my name?<eos> Because it's you, Jason Scott.<eos> You are the leader.<eos> You are the Red Ranger.
Boom goes the lunchbox, in detention goes Billy.<eos> But let's not forget that Kimberly Hart was also in... in detention, too, so...<eos> Not tonight.<eos> Skip me.<eos> What about you, dude?
What about you, dude?<eos> Why don't you tell us who you really are?<eos> Because everyone knows exactly who I am.<eos> Okay.<eos> What about you, crazy girl?
When all this is over.<eos> Are we Power Rangers or... are we friends?<eos> Do you know who I am?<eos> Yes.<eos> I was once just like you.
Yes.<eos> I was once just like you.<eos> So pretty.<eos> Innocent<eos> Are all the rangers on Zordon's new team as young as you?
You're so strong!<eos> I'm just kidding.<eos> You've got spunk, little Yellow.<eos> I see myself in you.<eos> I was an outsider on Zordon's team just like you.
I punched Ty Fleming in the face because he told everyone I was the meanest person he'd ever met.<eos> And he was right.<eos> Well, that can't be true.<eos> Okay.<eos> Whoa. - You took that picture?
Start over.<eos> Erase that picture right now.<eos> - Jason, it can't be erased.<eos> - Then live with it.<eos> You did an awful thing. It doesn't make you an awful person.
Zack, Billy, you circle the Krispy Kreme and make sure it's safe.<eos> I'm headed straight for Goldar.<eos> Copy!<eos> I'll hold her off.<eos> Kim, I'll go with you.
That might have been my fault.<eos> I'm sorry, y'all. I think Kimberly needs to move our feet.<eos> - No, I've got the arm.<eos> - Uh, no, I do. I've got the leg.<eos> - You're a leg, too?
I just wanna get home.<eos> I know.<eos> If there's even a... A home to get back to.<eos> baby, guess what?<eos> There's still room service and it's just for you.
I'm in your book?<eos> The first time i said I love you.<eos> Well before I said it to you, I wrote it in there.<eos> when I look around, i see a beautiful country,<eos> I see land, Springs, houses, and then there's you and me.
when I look around, i see a beautiful country,<eos> I see land, Springs, houses, and then there's you and me.<eos> And we have everything we need.<eos> Everything else, we can build.<eos> Just you and I together.
What's so funny about that?<eos> Maybe god got impatient.<eos> I can't tell you what's happening tonight.<eos> I've been trying to figure it out and I don't...<eos> I'm not giving up on you.
Longing for a foregone home.<eos> Perhaps a home that never was.<eos> And none of it matters.<eos> Even if god exists, he's forsaken us.<eos> You, human, go forth.
You're not looking for the living, you're marking the dead.<eos> Will you just come home?<eos> Baby, we can work on this together.<eos> There's no home here.<eos> You, me, nails. That's it.
There's no home here.<eos> You, me, nails. That's it.<eos> You don't know, we could be a statistical anomaly.<eos> Baby, we could be the world's last rounding error. You're looking for answers where there aren't any-- you're damn right I'm looking for answers!<eos> You have this insane situation and what, you think it's some celestial mistake?
You wanna talk with him about it again?<eos> He seemed to really go for it the first time.<eos> He's losing his grip.<eos> Now, follow me, and we'll get off this rock alive.<eos> Dear Billy I'm just trying to get home to you and your mom.
I wanted to see you, but--<eos> - I know you're always here, so...<eos> - I like it here.<eos> - I know. - Heh, heh, heh.<eos> That little guy wandered in here today just like you.
What the fuck?<eos> My daughter will get laid eventually.<eos> - Your daughter has gotten laid. - Shut up.<eos> I miss seeing you.<eos> I miss you too.
And keep taking your medication.<eos> Hey, Mom, it's Madeline.<eos> I didn't get the job that I told you about.<eos> So, anyways, I'm gonna fly home tonight.<eos> I just feel like you and Lily need me right now.
Thief.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> You heard me.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - These are for you. - Thank you.
No, like, um truth or dare or something.<eos> With two people?<eos> Yeah, I guess it doesn't make sense. Heh, heh.<eos> - Hi, Joanne.<eos> - Oh, my God, look at you.
Shit.<eos> I feel like I don't know you anymore.<eos> I feel like you know me better than everyone in this family.<eos> Whatever baggage we're bringing, let's grab it and put it out front.<eos> Found this for you.
- 'Cause I can't.<eos> - Why not?<eos> Because I can't, you know I can't.<eos> She thinks you're dead.<eos> John, you've got to remember, it's important.
Because Mrs Hudson's right.<eos> I'm burning up.<eos> I'm at the bottom of a pit and I'm still falling, and I'm never climbing out.<eos> I need you to know, John. I need you to see that up here I've still got it.<eos> So, when I tell you that this is the most dangerous, the most despicable human being that I have ever encountered. When I tell you that this monster must be ended.
Hello, Mycroft.<eos> There's a car downstairs.<eos> You know he should definitely have worn the hat.<eos> Still thinking about Sherlock?<eos> No, you are.
Sherlock...<eos> John, you want to watch this later?<eos> Save him.<eos> Don't think anyone else is going to save him because there isn't anyone.<eos> It's up to you.
Help me.<eos> Experiment complete.<eos> Conclusion,<eos> I have a sister.<eos> This was you?
Experiment complete.<eos> Conclusion,<eos> I have a sister.<eos> This was you?<eos> All of this was you?
Who was it said, "Truth is rarely pure and never simple"?<eos> I don't know and I don't care.<eos> So there were three of us.<eos> I know that now.<eos> You, me...
We have a maximum of three seconds to vacate the blast radius.<eos> John and I will take the windows, you take the stairs.<eos> Help get Mrs Hudson out, too.<eos> - Me? - You're closer.<eos> You're faster.
How did you know?<eos> How did I know?<eos> I taught you, don't you remember?<eos> How can you not remember that?<eos> Eurus, I don't remember you at all.
Look and play.<eos> No, not Bach.<eos> You clearly don't understand it.<eos> Me?<eos> You.
- Be naughty, step closer.<eos> - Why? - Do it.<eos> Step closer.<eos> Tell me what you remember.<eos> You, me and Mycroft.
Tell me what you remember.<eos> You, me and Mycroft.<eos> Mycroft was quite clever.<eos> He could understand things if you went a bit slow, but you...<eos> You were my favourite.
You think it's a trick.<eos> You look so... Unsure.<eos> You're not used to being unsure, are you?<eos> - It's more common than you'd think.<eos> - Look at you.
How?<eos> -There's a gun in the hatch. Take it.<eos> You want to save the governor's wife? Choose either Dr Watson or Mycroft to kill the governor.<eos> God.<eos> You can't do it, Sherlock. If you do it, it won't count. I'll kill her anyway.
It's your turn next. When I tell you to use it, and I will, remember what happened this time.<eos> What if I don't want a gun?<eos> The gun is intended as a mercy.<eos> - For whom?<eos> - You.
- Yes.<eos> You know, a violin.<eos> In exchange for?<eos> She's very clever.<eos> I'm beginning to think you're not.
- Yes, very good, Sherlock, or we could just look at the name on the lid.<eos> Only it isn't a name.<eos> So, it's for somebody who loves somebody.<eos> It's for somebody who loves Sherlock.<eos> This is all about you. Everything here.
- What?<eos> Shoot Dr Watson.<eos> There's no questioning who has to continue from here.<eos> It's us.<eos> You and me.
I can see a river.<eos> There's a big wheel.<eos> All right.<eos> Well, you and I are gonna have to drive this plane together.<eos> Just you and me.
Yep. Still not interested.<eos> The plane!<eos> You knew he'd take his revenge.<eos> His revenge, apparently, is me.<eos> Eurus, let me speak to the little girl on the plane and I'll play any game you like.
The wrong dates.<eos> She used the wrong dates from the gravestones as the key to the cipher, and the cipher was the song.<eos> Is this strictly relevant?<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> I'll be with you in a minute.
The average toddler spends, what? 45 hours a year on the potty?<eos> I'm the boss.<eos> I don't have that kind of spare time.<eos> Well, you're not the boss of me.<eos> - I am the boss of you.
I don't want your filthy money.<eos> Look, I told you to stay out of my way.<eos> I can't!<eos> You're in my house.<eos> I don't wanna be here... any more than you want me to be here.
- Not pumpkin.<eos> - Okay. That's a vegetable.<eos> Point is, the puppies' slice is getting bigger and bigger.<eos> They're stealing all our love!<eos> Just like you did to me.
Meanwhile, two days goes by like that.<eos> You better start packing.<eos> You don't get it, Templeton.<eos> If I'm fired, they'll take away my formula.<eos> I will turn into a normal baby... and live here forever with you.
Every birthday party...<eos> Every Christmas!<eos> I'll be there<eos> Year after year after year. We will grow old together.<eos> You and I... will be brothers.
I know, but we have to fix this.<eos> We have to make sure you don't get fired.<eos> We?<eos> We.<eos> I will help you... but just to get rid of you.
No way.<eos> Tim, what are you doing in here?<eos> Oh, no. Hey, what's all the racket?<eos> Isn't he adorable?<eos> I've got one for you, too!
- Rise and shine!<eos> Is something wrong? Am I fired?<eos> No, you're late for work.<eos> What? It's Take Your Kid to Work Day!<eos> And you're the kid.
Your dad and I have some work to do.<eos> You wanna come up to the office and hang out with us?<eos> We'll stick your brother in the Puppy Zone... while we have a little Tim time.<eos> Tim time?<eos> Dad and I know we haven't been able to do as much with you as we used to. So, what do you say?
Oh, please!<eos> Stop acting like a baby.<eos> You're a baby!<eos> You take that back.<eos> My life was perfect until you showed up!
So you're right. I don't know what it's like... to be part of a family.<eos> But I do care.<eos> You do?<eos> And the only way to save both is to stop Francis Francis.<eos> Yeah. I can't do this without you, Tim.
But I do care.<eos> You do?<eos> And the only way to save both is to stop Francis Francis.<eos> Yeah. I can't do this without you, Tim.<eos> I need you.
But how did you...?<eos> Hey! Where'd you go?<eos> Not again!<eos> Come on!<eos> I need you!
Argh!<eos> En garde!<eos> You're fired!<eos> And here's your severance package!<eos> Take that, you scurvy scallywag! Argh!
One minute and counting.<eos> - Help!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> No! Mom, Dad, I'm coming!<eos> Is that you?
You ruined everything!<eos> It's not fair! It's not fair!<eos> That's not right.<eos> Now you're really going to pay!<eos> Oh, yeah? It's time you pick on someone your own size!
Oh, yeah? It's time you pick on someone your own size!<eos> Eugene!<eos> You put me down!<eos> You hear me?<eos> I am the boss of you!
So... you did it.<eos> We did it.<eos> By the way, congratulations on your promotion.<eos> The corner office, the private potty. All that stuff.<eos> But, hey! How about you?
Every night at dinner, I will be there.<eos> Every birthday party, every Christmas morning... I will be there.<eos> Year after year after year.<eos> We will grow old together.<eos> And you and I will always be brothers.
Well, sweetie, that's how I remember it.<eos> - But you know what I found out?<eos> - What? There's plenty of love for everyone.<eos> Even me?<eos> Especially you.
Hey, kid, I hear you're gonna have a baby sister.<eos> I wanted a horse.<eos> Here you go, kid.<eos> Go get yourself a horse.<eos> You know, I'm proud of you, Leslie.
You're telling me.<eos> You wanna buy some batteries?<eos> All right, let's get baldy to Xandar and collect that bounty.<eos> That stuff about my father... Who does she think she is?<eos> I know you're sensitive about that.
That does sound pretty hot.<eos> It would make my nether regions engorge.<eos> Okay. I get it, yes.<eos> I'm a dancer, Gamora is not.<eos> You just need to find a woman who is pathetic... like you.
No, I won't.<eos> You'd think an evil supervillain would learn how to properly lie.<eos> I bet it's the one-inch man.<eos> After all these years, I've found you.<eos> And who the hell are you?
I told you before!<eos> I didn't know what was going on!<eos> You didn't know because you didn't want to know because it made you rich.<eos> I demand a seat at the table!<eos> I wear these flames, same as you.
God, you're like an old woman.<eos> Because I'm wise?<eos> Why do you have so much luggage?<eos> I don't want Groot playing with my things.<eos> I hope Daddy isn't as big of a dick as you, orphan boy.
They are going to kill him!<eos> I tell you, it was pretty easy to find you.<eos> I put a tracer on your ship back there... during the war over Xandar.<eos> Give me your word you won't hurt Groot... and I'll tell you where the batteries are.<eos> Lucky for you, my word don't mean squat.
When did you meet my mother?<eos> Not long after.<eos> It was with Meredith that I first experienced love.<eos> I called her my river lily.<eos> And from that love, Peter... you.
Udonta, I have waited a long time to do...<eos> What?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I am so sorry!<eos> I just keep imagining you waking up in the morning, sir... looking in the mirror and then in all seriousness saying to yourself...
Over the millions and millions of years of my existence... I've made many mistakes, Peter.<eos> But you're not one of them.<eos> Please give me the chance to be the father she would want me to be.<eos> There's so much that I need to teach you about this planet... and the light within.<eos> They are a part of you, Peter.
Yes!<eos> Yes, now shape it.<eos> Feel that energy.<eos> Yes.<eos> You're home.
When you're ugly, and someone loves you... you know they love you for who you are.<eos> Beautiful people never know who to trust.<eos> Well, then I'm certainly grateful to be ugly.<eos> Those pools, they remind me of a time... when I took my daughter to the forgotten lakes of my homeworld.<eos> She was like you.
I was a Kree battle slave for 20 years when Stakar freed me.<eos> He offered me a place with the Ravagers.<eos> He said all I needed to do was adhere to the code.<eos> But I was young... and greedy, and stupid.<eos> Like you stealing those batteries.
He said all I needed to do was adhere to the code.<eos> But I was young... and greedy, and stupid.<eos> Like you stealing those batteries.<eos> That was mostly Drax.<eos> Me and Stakar and the other captains... we weren't so different from you and your friends.
Rocket?<eos> Rocket, are you there?<eos> What are you doing, Peter?<eos> Dance with me.<eos> I'm not going to dance with you.
It's obvious!<eos> You were the one who wanted to win. And I just wanted a sister!<eos> You were all I had.<eos> But you were the one who needed to win.<eos> Thanos pulled my eye from my head... and my brain from my skull... and my arm from my body... because of you.
Yeah, it was.<eos> One of Earth's greatest musical compositions.<eos> Perhaps its very greatest.<eos> Yes!<eos> Peter, you and I, we're the sailor in that song.
What are you laughing at me for?<eos> You can fool yourself and everyone else, but you can't fool me.<eos> I know who you are.<eos> You don't know anything about me, loser.<eos> I know everything about you.
You don't know anything about me, loser.<eos> I know everything about you.<eos> I know you play like you're the meanest and the hardest... but, actually, you're the most scared of all.<eos> Shut up!<eos> I know you steal batteries you don't need... and you push away anyone who's willing to put up with you... because just a little bit of love... reminds you how big and empty that hole inside you actually is.
I know you play like you're the meanest and the hardest... but, actually, you're the most scared of all.<eos> Shut up!<eos> I know you steal batteries you don't need... and you push away anyone who's willing to put up with you... because just a little bit of love... reminds you how big and empty that hole inside you actually is.<eos> I said shut up!<eos> I know them scientists what made you, never gave a rat's ass about you.
It broke the Ravager code, but I compensated him generously... and to ease his conscience, I said I'd never hurt them.<eos> I mean, that was true. They never felt a thing.<eos> But one after the other, they failed me.<eos> Not one of them carried the Celestial genes.<eos> Until you, Peter.
I mean, that was true. They never felt a thing.<eos> But one after the other, they failed me.<eos> Not one of them carried the Celestial genes.<eos> Until you, Peter.<eos> Out of all my spawn... only you carried the connection to the light.
- All any of you do... is yell at each other. You are not friends.<eos> You're right.<eos> We're family.<eos> We leave no one behind.<eos> Except maybe you.
For the first time in my existence...<eos> I am truly not alone!<eos> What is it, son?<eos> My friends.<eos> You see, that's the mortal in you, Peter.
You really need to grow up.<eos> I wanted to do this together... but I suppose you'll have to learn by spending the next thousand years as a battery!<eos> Finally!<eos> Rocket?<eos> Keep that transmitter nearby, so I can find you.
Didn't you say you could make him sleep?<eos> When he wants.<eos> He's too powerful.<eos> I can't!<eos> You don't have to believe in yourself... because I believe in you.
I asked Yondu...<eos> - and she was sitting next to him.<eos> - I knew you were lying!<eos> You have priceless batteries and an atomic bomb in your bag.<eos> If anybody's gonna have tape, it's you!
Yondu, we're about to blow!<eos> Get to the ship!<eos> Not without Quill!<eos> You need to take care of the twig!<eos> Not without you!
Yondu didn't have a talking car, but he did have a flying arrow.<eos> He didn't have the beautiful voice of an angel... but he did have the whistle of one.<eos> Both Yondu and David Hasselhoff went on kick-ass adventures... and hooked up with hot women... and fought robots.<eos> I guess David Hasselhoff did kind of end up being my dad after all.<eos> Only it was you, Yondu.
You don't even know it.<eos> I am Groot.<eos> He did call you twig.<eos> Nebula...<eos> I was a child like you.
I was a child like you.<eos> I was concerned with staying alive until the next day, every day.<eos> And I never considered what Thanos was doing to you.<eos> I'm trying to make it right.<eos> There are little girls like you... across the universe who are in danger.
I will help them by killing Thanos.<eos> I don't know if that's possible.<eos> You will always be my sister.<eos> Pete!<eos> Captain found this for you in a junker shop.
What?<eos> It's just... some unspoken thing.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> It is.<eos> And so are you.
Oh and your brother's coming home in a couple of days.<eos> I guess he couldn't hide her from us forever, could he?<eos> Couple days, right?<eos> Ohhh, no hold it up.<eos> I've been needing a new picture of you.
Oh, I just love your drawings, look at that gold leaf.<eos> Here.<eos> - Sorry... sorry.<eos> - Oh, hang on,<eos> I got a surprise for you.
- Oh. Hi.<eos> - Hi, nice to meet you.<eos> - Nice to meet you.<eos> - Lauren how are you?<eos> - Good, how are you?
All right, all right.<eos> Do you have the guy who is required to remain 200 feet away from playgrounds?<eos> - That guy?<eos> - Yup, that's him.<eos> You been... uh
I'm sorry did you just call me a Puss-y.<eos> No I called you a Puss, it's different...<eos> But you are pussy.<eos> I'm not... a pussy.<eos> I'll help you, turn around.
I will do that for you, but he's probably sleeping.<eos> He really needs his rest.<eos> Watch this.<eos> Okay, Puss.<eos> If you can stack a tower higher than this without making it topple, then no shots for you.
Two days, Monday.<eos> Okay, so I'll handle the tasting.<eos> Take over catering, printing, you already sent in the deposit for the speakers right?<eos> Already done.<eos> I really wanted to be here with Kenny, and you.
It's cold.<eos> We should, get out.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well I'm glad it's going so well, I had no doubts.<eos> Mom and Lauren being nice to you?
Gotta fix that.<eos> Okay.<eos> Everything else Okay?<eos> Yeah, I'm just, I'm tired.<eos> Um, and, honestly I've been thinking a lot and um, I was just curious was there ever an exact moment that you and Kenny knew that you wanted to make wine?
Oh, uh, it was a sixth grade field trip, and then started dreaming up ways we could turn his parent's farm into a vineyard, to throw stomping parties of our own.<eos> Nice...<eos> Yeah, I guess um...<eos> I've never really had a moment like that about anything.<eos> Babe I don't need you to...
- I think there are thirteen.<eos> I still got a couple more boxes in the trunk.<eos> I never did get Paulette to sign up.<eos> Oh just keep her in your back pocket, hon, you'll see.<eos> Once you and Lauren start making sales, it'll be fine.
Nothing went wrong, I dropped my phone and that is the only thing that varied minutely from all the details that we discussed, and planned, and discussed again.<eos> Let's not get upset.<eos> Uh...<eos> We can discuss it, we'll share the floor when I get back.<eos> Just keep your phone on you is all, Okay?
Please explain.<eos> No, it's none of my business.<eos> - It seems like it is.<eos> - Lauren, now<eos> I have something for you Sherri.
- Go to my room?<eos> - Get out of here now!<eos> I'm sorry, you can stay. Gail, you can stay, please, Sherri.<eos> Oh, Lauren!<eos> What is wrong with you?
- Get out of here now!<eos> I'm sorry, you can stay. Gail, you can stay, please, Sherri.<eos> Oh, Lauren!<eos> What is wrong with you?<eos> What is wrong with you?
Oh, Lauren!<eos> What is wrong with you?<eos> What is wrong with you?<eos> Who gives a shit what they think?<eos> I care those are my friends and let me tell you something Missy, there wasn't a meal you ate after your daddy died that those women didn't fix for you.
You awake?<eos> Look, I know<eos> I know you're not.<eos> I don't want you to think that I'm like, but now you're in this big hurry to leave and I don't want to not ever see you, and, and, you won't even look at me.<eos> No, it's not because of you, it's just, what happened, - that can't happen.
No.<eos> No.<eos> We're good.<eos> Good, cause it's meant a lot to me that, you know, not like that, just... and I don't want to have like, fucked all that up.<eos> Or for you and Justin either.
Shit...<eos> Okay.<eos> - Yeah, I really should go.<eos> - Yeah, go.<eos> I should go, but this is not because of you, it's just because I...
You do not get to twist this around.<eos> You think I like kissing ass all day?<eos> Fuck you!<eos> People make sacrifices!<eos> Justin, you apologize right this second.
Great, now I'm defending you.<eos> This is my home.<eos> You did this thing in my home?<eos> I tried to help you.<eos> I gave you a place to stay, I tried to get you work, I made you meals.
I tried to help you.<eos> I gave you a place to stay, I tried to get you work, I made you meals.<eos> Yeah, you're great.<eos> Who would guess that you're a bigot?<eos> Hey, is it cool if I chill with you for a little bit?
- Yeah, sure, sure.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Everything Okay?<eos> - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> I just uh... is it Okay if I chill here with you?
- I mean, Oklahoma.<eos> - Go us.<eos> - That's not...<eos> - And fuck you,<eos> I'm so glad to hear my dream of local wine is so preposterous to you.
Justin, I don't care where the branches go, I honestly don't.<eos> Well I do care!<eos> I care about this branch.<eos> I know you do, and of course I care. I just,<eos> I've been doing everything in my power to make this happen for you.
Is it?<eos> Because it seems like it was your choice.<eos> Three bedroom, one bath and the last tenant...<eos> It just doesn't make sense anymore, for him to come back with me.<eos> I've had more with you, than I've had in two years with Justin.
Me too.<eos> Justin, Justin.<eos> I know you don't want me here,<eos> I'm not going to stay, I promise you, Okay?<eos> I did these for you.
I came to get my boxes, and I wanted to tell you that I was sorry... and stuff.<eos> Is Justin here?<eos> He is.<eos> Okay.<eos> That's for you.
Can I ask you?<eos> When Nicole was dying, why didn't you just come to the hospital?<eos> Oh, honey, I told you<eos> - I tried, more than once.<eos> - Yeah, but I needed you there with me.
Memo.<eos> Print.<eos> - Centaur, some privacy. - Again?<eos> All you ever ask for is privacy these days.<eos> I remember time when you and I...
- Tell me about it.<eos> Anyway, the second I turn 18, I'm so outta here.<eos> Emancipation...<eos> "Emancipation, mobility, music."<eos> No, Tulsa, I just wish I could go with you.
Alright Check the sprays.<eos> - Checked<eos> - Not while I'm standing behind the plane.<eos> Ok, we are gonna loose some of the property.<eos> - You do it.
- You do it.<eos> You can fly this thing.<eos> You do it.<eos> Awesome parenting, seriously Risk my life for a 190 plucks.<eos> Good to know how my life is worth to you.
You're okay.<eos> You're okay.<eos> I'm right here.<eos> Are you insane?<eos> Do you think that the protocol does not apply to you?
Do you think that the protocol does not apply to you?<eos> You could have caused an atmospheric breach, not to mention die.<eos> No body rides unaccompanied, no matter who they are<eos> Gardner, What is going on here?<eos> This is not like you.
Okay?<eos> Her ashes was spread across the Pacific Ocean.<eos> You deserve to know that.<eos> She's not out there, Gardner.<eos> She is in you.
But why.<eos> Is that normal?<eos> - I believe the term is 'euphoria'.<eos> Sorry about the quarantine.<eos> It's to protect you from us, not us from you.
I am Fine.<eos> I just weigh too much.<eos> I know who you are.<eos> I want to be them.<eos> Well, It's Funny, because they want to be you.
I have to talk to you. Gardner trusts me, he doesn't trust you.<eos> Kendra, give me a minute.<eos> We need teams on the Washington Avenue Amtrak station...<eos> - the airport and cover the bus stations.<eos> - I'm coming with you.
You play?<eos> - Used to.<eos> What's your favorite thing about earth?<eos> Dreaming.<eos> How about you?
Tulsa.<eos> Can you slow down?<eos> This gravity is very heavy.<eos> Oh.<eos> I'm sorry but this is heavy for you.
To keep him making contact with the outside world.<eos> Preventing exactly this kind of eventuality.<eos> You hanging this on me?<eos> I admired you more than anyone.<eos> We have been souldering East Texas for you.
- Because we are all messed up and scared... and try to be something we are not.<eos> And if we all went around just declaring our innermost desires to the exact people we felt them for...<eos> Then we will all end up happy, or something.<eos> Look, Gardner...<eos> I'm happy that you think I am beautiful...and .. kind of having an amazing time with you.
You don't understand.<eos> On Mars, the people didn't do this.<eos> We just had scientists they studied ground samples.<eos> Shut up, Gardner.<eos> I thought about you everyday up there.
We just had scientists they studied ground samples.<eos> Shut up, Gardner.<eos> I thought about you everyday up there.<eos> I know what's going to happen.<eos> I'm gonna fall in love with you and I'll fall to earth.
Shut up, Gardner.<eos> I thought about you everyday up there.<eos> I know what's going to happen.<eos> I'm gonna fall in love with you and I'll fall to earth.<eos> I'll be just like you.
All my life I could not feel anything.<eos> I couldn't feel water, I couldn't feel fire.<eos> I could not feel wind on my face.<eos> And now I can.<eos> That's nothing compared to what I feel with you.
It's It's not real.<eos> It's not how I.. how I pictured it.<eos> Hurting my heads to see it like this.<eos> I'm sorry Gardner, but the world doesn't always give you exactly what you want.<eos> It gave to you.
Oh yeah, I did.<eos> Gardner I think you are sick.<eos> None of this is how it was in my head.<eos> - You need to go to the hospital.<eos> - Except you.
None of this is how it was in my head.<eos> - You need to go to the hospital.<eos> - Except you.<eos> - You need to go to the hospital.<eos> Something is wrong with you.
I didn't get to choose where I was born... but I get to choose where I die.<eos> - Tulsa.<eos> - Yes, Gardner?<eos> What's your favourite thing about earth?<eos> You are, Gardner.
And I love you.<eos> How is he doing?<eos> - Stable, for now.<eos> This will buy us the time we need.<eos> - And you?
You must be hungry.<eos> I made your favorite, chicken stew.<eos> Go wash up so we can eat.<eos> I put in this and that.<eos> Everything that's good for you.
Because genetic mutation is too dangerous,<eos> Mirando's been disguising it as natural, safe and non-GMO.<eos> But that's a complete scam.<eos> Millions of GM pigs are already lining up in front of slaughterhouses.<eos> You and the other local farmers are just promotional devices for them. Just a picturesque backdrop.
Is that what you're saying?<eos> 'Cause, brother, we've come halfway around the world for this.<eos> - We should get this done now.<eos> - Don't be so selfish.<eos> This isn't about you or us, and she is Okja's family.
Just what I need!<eos> Hey, Nance.<eos> How's London? Is that rain?<eos> That can't be good for the golf.<eos> Just letting you know I'm thinking of you.
You're having a moment, I see.<eos> Yes, things are going super well.<eos> It's all a massive success.<eos> Really?<eos> They keep showing very unflattering pictures of you in the press.
Really?<eos> They keep showing very unflattering pictures of you in the press.<eos> Those ones of you as a fat child on Daddy's knee.<eos> Such nasty remarks.<eos> All eyes are on you, aren't they, squeaky clean icon?
I think she understands some English.<eos> So we should be careful what we say.<eos> Yes, yes, everything is fine.<eos> But you have to wear this.<eos> It's a special edition, custom-made, just for you.
We have a deal.<eos> This thing is worth a lot of money.<eos> Make sure our customer and her purchase get home safely.<eos> Our first ever Mirando super pig sale.<eos> Pleasure doing business with you.
that black people will ruin your credit.<eos> No...<eos> What?<eos> Dude, you... you have to stop.<eos> And you have to stop.
Can you just move past it like they did?<eos> Okay.<eos> Let's go find your guy.<eos> All right, all right, but let me do the talking, because, you know, guys like Z, they don't like strangers.<eos> Yeah, but you're not you.
My friend?<eos> Close the door behind you... on your way out.<eos> Dougie, where do you get the stones to call my best agent a liar?<eos> Agent.<eos> He closes more cases in a week than you do in a month.
The good Dale is in the lodge, and he can't leave.<eos> Write it in your diary." Unquote.<eos> "Dale" as in Special Agent Dale Cooper?<eos> Right.<eos> What do you think this means?
And we're very appreciative.<eos> What'd you say your name was, again?<eos> Tammy.<eos> Fuck you, Tammy.<eos> I knew it was going to be you.
Are you okay?<eos> Oh, Dougie.<eos> What... Are you okay?<eos> And he just... he just...<eos> Dougie took right over, and he just chopped him right in the throat and said, "You get off," and I kicked him, and I punched him, and that was it, and... and Dougie just took care of business.
Watch right here.<eos> Bobby, when your father told me this, you were a very long way from where you are today.<eos> Somehow, he knew that it would all turn out well.<eos> He saw this life for you.<eos> Your father never lost faith in you.
Wait a minute.<eos> There's something else.<eos> "COOPER/COOPER."<eos> Two Coopers.<eos> We came out to join you, Diane, while Albert's indisposed.
Not Batman<eos> How is he beating all of you again?<eos> Because... Hey, hey, hey, hey! I'm Batman!<eos> It's gonna blow!<eos> Hi, Batman! So weird to keep running into you.
- Batman doesn't do 'ships.<eos> - What? As in "relationships."<eos> There is no "us."<eos> Batman and Joker are not a thing.<eos> I don't need you.
Check it out, guys. I built a CD rack.<eos> And how am I supposed to get Batman's respect when I'm working with these human farts?<eos> Boo-boo, look at me.<eos> You're too good for Batman.<eos> He needs to open his eyes and see what it feels like when you're not around. Okay?
- Cool.<eos> And, Harley, you know what to do.<eos> I sure do.<eos> It's time for Operation "Take Out the Laundry."<eos> Butler One, this is Bat One. Do you copy?
Cool it. You're a criminal.<eos> You run, and I catch you.<eos> Not anymore, Batman.<eos> You were right. There is no "us."<eos> So, there's no point in me trying to fight you anymore.
- Let's go!<eos> Faster, Dad!<eos> Oh! Oh, my goodness.<eos> I am so sorry.<eos> Get back up in that seat. There you go.
- No, you're not!<eos> I knew you'd say that.<eos> - No, you didn't!<eos> - No, you didn't! And I knew you'd say that!<eos> See? We aren't so different, I and you.
Hello? Bad guys?<eos> What a crew, huh?<eos> And they all work for me!<eos> Who's the greatest villain of them all now, Batman?<eos> Still not you.
These diseased lunatics are right.<eos> Yes, we are!<eos> I am not gonna be part of a one-sided relationship any longer!<eos> - Yes! - What are you talking about?<eos> - You and I are done!
No. You're not serious.<eos> Wingardium Leviosa!<eos> No! You know what? For once, Batman, you're right.<eos> I'm not your greatest enemy.<eos> Your greatest enemy is you.
Hold on a second, Brick Lady.<eos> I'm so sorry. I need to get down there and stop this.<eos> I can't let you go.<eos> My boss will be really mad at me.<eos> Yeah. But I bet your boss would be happy if you were able to get all those bad guys back in here.
Flip.<eos> Flip? What is that?<eos> You gotta turn around.<eos> I call it the Babs-Signal.<eos> And I'm flipping the switch for you.
- Here we go. You got this, Alfred?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Abs of steel.<eos> Great!<eos> Now you bend, and I'll grab the other side!
If there's no Gotham, then I'll never get to fight you again.<eos> What?<eos> You're the reason why I get up at 4:00 in the afternoon and pump iron until my chest is positively sick.<eos> You're the reason I've given up a life spent with Russian ballerinas and lady activewear models.<eos> And if it wasn't for you, I never would have learned how connected I am with all these people.
What?<eos> You're the reason why I get up at 4:00 in the afternoon and pump iron until my chest is positively sick.<eos> You're the reason I've given up a life spent with Russian ballerinas and lady activewear models.<eos> And if it wasn't for you, I never would have learned how connected I am with all these people.<eos> And you.
Sometimes, losing people is part of life.<eos> But that doesn't mean you stop letting them in.<eos> Some very wise people taught me that.<eos> My father figure. My platonic coworker buddy, who's a girl, but just a friend.<eos> And you. Mi hijo.
You did that?<eos> my friend.<eos> buddy... uh...<eos> Uh... whatever.<eos> Is this you?
sometimes you still sound like you're an eight-year-old.<eos> Dad.<eos> I get the whole "disappointed-in-me" thing.<eos> You've been doing it my whole life.<eos> I expect more of you.
- You guys are no good!<eos> Darryl.<eos> I could hear those feet slapping on the sidewalk a block away.<eos> sensei. My shoes are too big.<eos> I could smell your garlic breath before you walked out your door.
too.<eos> For... for what?<eos> For being alive.<eos> That's just stupid.<eos> Apologize now or I'm going to hurt you.
They drugged me.<eos> They... they... they brought me here against my will.<eos> You saw me being attacked the other night.<eos> You know there's something going on.<eos> Why would anyone be after you in the first place?
I am the only one who can do it.<eos> Please... you have to get me out of here.<eos> don't worry.<eos> I'll take care of everything.<eos> Right now... you should just go back to sleep.
- Oh, you don't need to know that.<eos> And I want you to put Joy onto Patel.<eos> She'll be able to close it.<eos> I can handle this.<eos> Doesn't it occur to you that I'm doing this all for you?
- Really?<eos> Because it doesn't seem that way when you directly disobey an order.<eos> I asked to have Danny moved to a safe location, and you tried to have him killed.<eos> You don't understand that...<eos> If you just do things my way, it'll all work out for you, Ward.
So I'm asking you, when he reappears, keep him safe... until I decide what to do with him.<eos> Do I need to spell it out any further?<eos> No. No, I got it. I...<eos> I'll take care of all of it.<eos> You're my son, and I'm gonna make you a great man.
And it might help if you took a shower.<eos> Soon.<eos> All I'm saying is when people start to discover it's Danny, we're gonna have a problem.<eos> We can't admit that it's him, even if it is true.<eos> You and I need to be united on that front, okay?
Danny, what happened to you?<eos> Why are you back here?<eos> It's complicated.<eos> And every time I try and tell the story, people freak out.<eos> But you and Ward, you're the only link to a life that I had.
- Maybe it sounds ridiculous, but...<eos> ...it's all I got.<eos> No, it doesn't sound ridiculous.<eos> I was 13 when Dad died.<eos> And I still hadn't quite gotten over you and your family.
Calvin Klein, right?<eos> Marc Jacobs.<eos> You mind if we go inside?<eos> That's cool.<eos> I wanna be fair with you, Danny.
Because this homeless hipster thing isn't working for you.<eos> Why is everyone on at me about how I look?<eos> It's New York City.<eos> It matters.<eos> If this is too much for you...
This is not the time or the place.<eos> You were like a brother to me.<eos> A terrible jackass of a brother, but still... I looked up to you.<eos> What does that have to do with anything?<eos> I know you sent that guy.
What does that have to do with anything?<eos> I know you sent that guy.<eos> You were the only one with me the day I broke my arm.<eos> - What guy?<eos> - Why is this so important to you?
Any of you guys wanna get in and take a shot, sign up with Leon right there.<eos> Who's it gonna be?<eos> Gonna be you?<eos> Who's gonna be the tough guy, huh?<eos> You?
No, actually, I do what I want.<eos> I can walk out of here, go to the corner for a cup of coffee, go to the movies, talk to people on the street.<eos> You can't.<eos> If I go to The New York Times and tell them to come...<eos> Your sister'd be killed and so would you.
Dad, are you sure you should be saying this?<eos> It's okay.<eos> Danny needs to know this.<eos> So... there I was.<eos> Hadn't even gotten over losing my best friend, not to mention you and Heather.
This isn't a negotiation.<eos> Maybe we should give him his dad's old office, while we're at it.<eos> Yeah, great idea.<eos> Make it happen, Ward.<eos> I've got big plans for you, Danny.
- Well, only recently they... they demanded we purchase a local pier out near, uh, where... where was it?<eos> Red Hook.<eos> Yeah, Joy closed the deal on the pier.<eos> Talk with her.<eos> We've needed a fighter like you back in the family.
- Hey, that'd be great.<eos> Feel free to call or come by any time.<eos> You need to watch yourself, Danny.<eos> I'm not afraid of the Hand.<eos> Good for you.
- Figured he'd want it this way.<eos> - That's nice and all, but... have you put any serious thought into what he's gonna do here?<eos> Hell if I know.<eos> You're the one that opened the door for Monastery Boy with the bowl.<eos> I know it was you.
- I didn't put him in there.<eos> - Oh, now, son.<eos> This isn't the time to point fingers.<eos> It's the time for solutions.<eos> Can I count on you to handle this reporter?
It was horrible.<eos> Anyway... your return made me take a hard look at the person that I've become, and I didn't like it.<eos> I just didn't think that Dad would like it either, so...<eos> I had to do the right thing.<eos> You know, if it helps any, I think Harold would have been crazy proud of you.
I thought you said you didn't want the cops involved.<eos> Hmm, good point.<eos> That doesn't mean I don't wanna know what the hell was going on tonight.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You and me both.
Oh, what was that?<eos> Come on, hit me.<eos> You are not to be underestimated, Claire.<eos> Hell, I'm still getting used to bringing the hurt... instead of fixing it.<eos> Well, for what it's worth... I've never had a student progress as fast as you have.
Better put that hood up.<eos> - Does it bother you?<eos> - What?<eos> That everyone knows me now.<eos> It doesn't bother you?
I got used to it as a kid.<eos> Well, just watch yourself.<eos> How so?<eos> You've gone from homeless man to billionaire in a matter of days.<eos> All that money, press, power, makes you a target.
Because of who you are, there will always be forces gathering against you... preparing, waiting... looking for a weakness in you.
Because of who you are, there will always be forces gathering against you... preparing, waiting... looking for a weakness in you.<eos> Disguised as a friend.<eos> Slipping past you as a stranger.
Do this tomorrow.<eos> This can't wait.<eos> Fine.<eos> No more bullshit.<eos> I'm going with you.
Too risky.<eos> Sundown.<eos> Of course.<eos> Danny, what you're talking about is crazy.<eos> I'll go with you.
Keep him calm.<eos> - Sabina, do you hate me?<eos> - I don't wanna do this.<eos> You're doing great.<eos> He's... he's focused on you.
The challenge has begun.<eos> You cannot be in two places at once.<eos> You must be a double-edged sword.<eos> So you know how to fight.<eos> But it doesn't make you the Iron Fist.
It'll help you let go.<eos> And that's what you want, isn't it?<eos> No.<eos> Oh, it is.<eos> You want to be free of all that is boiling inside of you to get out.
You can let it out.<eos> Let it take you.<eos> You're trying to get my heart racing to spread the poison faster.<eos> Good!<eos> This is the real you.
- What do you want?<eos> I need your help with something over at the penthouse.<eos> It's important.<eos> Really not a good time.<eos> Hey, I need you, son.
I, uh, I talked to Danny.<eos> He said he's gonna apologize to the board.<eos> Great.<eos> Hey, listen.<eos> I'm sorry I snapped at you last night.
There are places... discreet places... that could help you.<eos> I think that's a good idea.<eos> Come here.<eos> You just gotta let me know you're safe.<eos> I'm here for you.
But he isn't.<eos> And as far as I can tell, he's nowhere in this company.<eos> And believe me, I've spent most of the day looking.<eos> I know you all want me to back out on this... but my dad once told me,<eos> "If something is worth fighting for, you stand and you fight."
Just incredible.<eos> Yeah, this image, the serpent, do you know what it means?<eos> Did you know about the offices on the 13th floor?<eos> Well, if I had known, I would have had Ward charge her rent.<eos> Hey, I've always been honest with you, Danny.
I've seen someone else take on the Hand.<eos> It didn't end well.<eos> I appreciate your concern, but I've already made up my mind.<eos> I'm sorry I dragged you both into my fight, but, hopefully, this trip will end the Hand's story in all of our lives.<eos> I'm going with you.
Exactly.<eos> I was just out of law school.<eos> No one here took me seriously.<eos> They had every right not to.<eos> The job just didn't come naturally to me like it did for you.
Big Pun?<eos> Old school.<eos> I've had it since I was ten.<eos> You must've been a pretty gangsta ten-year-old.<eos> So what's going on with you and Miss Thang?
A gentleman never kisses and tells.<eos> You don't have to say anything.<eos> It's written all over your face.<eos> "Danny Rand got some."<eos> What about you?
Just let it out.<eos> I can't breathe.<eos> Yes, you can.<eos> You just feel like you can't.<eos> You just need to focus on something else.
Mom! Mom!<eos> It's gonna be okay.<eos> Stay in your seat.<eos> Heather!<eos> We got you, Danny.
Afterwards, my dad sent me to live with my grandfather in Japan, but...<eos> I always felt kinda...<eos> I don't know.<eos> Abandoned.<eos> It doesn't matter how much anyone else cares for you.
- You're goddamn right I did.<eos> You tried to cut a deal behind my back, didn't you?<eos> I could've gotten us both what we wanted.<eos> How could you do this to me?<eos> I did this for you.
I've almost been killed three times this week.<eos> So no, Colleen, I'd say I'm pretty friggin' far from okay.<eos> I mean, are you hurt?<eos> No.<eos> But you are.
I need to get into this building, and you're in my way.<eos> Maybe you could finish your nap elsewhere?<eos> I'm quite comfortable here. Yeah?<eos> Oh, you could try to make me move... but I wouldn't advise it.<eos> I don't want to have to fight you.
Your haircut for example, very nice.<eos> But we both swore an oath of loyalty and protection.<eos> Your masters are murderers.<eos> Our paths diverge in a different place.<eos> But unlike you, I've remained true to my vow.
Nothing she says will make you feel better about that.<eos> Let's just be done with this.<eos> So now you're ganging up on me?<eos> We're not.<eos> We're with you.
So... what do you want, Ward?<eos> I'll do anything you ask.<eos> I want you to leave me alone.<eos> I don't want any part of Rand... or any of this insanity.<eos> I want my own life away from you.
I hope someday you can understand that.<eos> Then I can go?<eos> Well, if that's what it takes, yes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Oh, I just want what's best for you and your, uh, sister.
But it's the safest place I know.<eos> How do you feel?<eos> Yeah, I'm, uh...<eos> I'm tired.<eos> I was so worried about you.
You know, sometimes in life, um, things happen that we're not prepared for.<eos> You know, we just do the best we can.<eos> Do you remember those nights?<eos> When I was sick?<eos> And you and Ward were there every two hours.
Death?<eos> It was like when I was a kid... coming home from school through the snow, and... and then I'd be standing on the porch, freezing, and on the other side was comfort.<eos> But this time... This time when I tried the handle, the door wouldn't open.<eos> And I could hear you.<eos> I could hear you and Ward on the other side, and...
Hopefully, it won't come to that.<eos> Look, I know that secrets... secrets and lies have... they've taken a toll on our family.<eos> They've almost ruined us, but...<eos> I want a future free from all of that.<eos> For you, for me... for all of us.
There's something I'd like to show Danny first.<eos> Yeah. Sure.<eos> She's very special.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Colleen has spoken to me about you quite a bit.
Yeah. Sure.<eos> She's very special.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Colleen has spoken to me about you quite a bit.<eos> That's funny... she's never mentioned you.
But that was the Iron Fist doing his duty.<eos> Guarding an entry.<eos> If that's why you're interested in me, then... you got the wrong man.<eos> I don't need a guard, Danny. I need a partner.<eos> With you at my side, no one would stand against us.
There are Gaos everywhere.<eos> I need you to train and lead a group of people who will take care of those that our culture's left behind.<eos> The marginalized and forgotten.<eos> People like Colleen.<eos> People like you.
I've read the news.<eos> You can use help there as well.<eos> I can provide that.<eos> But your destiny... is here.<eos> Doing something only you can do.
- and I'm... I can't.<eos> - One for you.<eos> One for me.<eos> Come on.<eos> - One for you, and one for me.
How was he?<eos> He seems ready.<eos> Thank you for all you've done.<eos> I didn't do anything.<eos> I know this has been hard on you.
I need to be.<eos> I don't like keeping things from him.<eos> He'll understand.<eos> What if he doesn't?<eos> Then... he's not right for you.
What if he doesn't?<eos> Then... he's not right for you.<eos> It's complicated... I know.<eos> But it's for the best.<eos> He may be hurt in the beginning, but if he feels about you the way you feel about him... he'll make the right choice.
Colleen brought me.<eos> - Are you coming onboard here?<eos> - Oh, thinking about it.<eos> That would be so kick-ass.<eos> I... I've been telling them about you.
Oh, I know. I know.<eos> I know what it's like to have a troubled son.<eos> - Stop.<eos> - See?<eos> We share so much, you and I.
And you know it.<eos> You remember the promise you made?<eos> No more lies.<eos> Complete honesty.<eos> Well, Dad, I need to know... did you have Wilkins killed?
You're a warrior, like me.<eos> Trained to be the Iron Fist.<eos> But I'm not the Iron Fist.<eos> I wasn't chosen.<eos> You were.
It's clean.<eos> Or cleaner.<eos> A friend of mine left it here.<eos> Is your friend okay?<eos> Probably doing better than you are.
These are Rand accounts.<eos> - It's our bank.<eos> - This is it.<eos> This is the silver bullet I've been looking for, Joy!<eos> I am so proud of you.
- Guarding the pass.<eos> - Guarding K'un-Lun.<eos> Danny?<eos> I didn't know where else you would go.<eos> Is Bakuto with you?
- To do what?<eos> To become the kind of people who help make the world a better place.<eos> He's getting them jobs in hospitals and businesses.<eos> He's using them for his own means.<eos> It's the same thing he's doing to you.
The world is more complicated than what a bunch of monks think.<eos> - The Hand is evil.<eos> - You're wrong!<eos> Why are you even here, Colleen?<eos> Because... because I care about you.
I need to get it to my father's old business partner.<eos> He can help us out.<eos> Okay, Danny, think this through.<eos> You can't just keep charging into this.<eos> The Hand wants something from you.
- Bakuto, what the hell is this?<eos> You were supposed to tell me when you found Danny.<eos> I blame myself for this.<eos> Bakuto, I believe in the Hand!<eos> But I don't know... if I believe in you.
- I felt like I had you all to myself.<eos> - Well, it meant a lot.<eos> Well, here we are with a second chance.<eos> Promise me when this is all over, we can make up for lost time. - Mmm-hmm.<eos> - You, me, Danny, Ward.
- Well, I'm...<eos> I'm helping Dad free us from the Hand.<eos> Oh, Jesus.<eos> - What?<eos> - He's using you, Joy.
- No.<eos> He's always been a bastard to me.<eos> Ever since he... came back from the dead, it's like a...<eos> It's like a piece of his soul got left in the grave.<eos> He will use you, hurt you, and throw you aside without a second thought.
- Oh, you've lost it, son.<eos> I don't care what you think.<eos> Joy's coming with me.<eos> Okay. Yeah.<eos> I'll come with you.
Maybe Danny's figured, with all of you out of the way, he'll be in charge of Rand.<eos> - That's not who he is.<eos> - Shh! Relax.<eos> Danny always knew the right thing to do.<eos> Unlike you and me.
I don't wanna have to swing twice.<eos> Any last words?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Ward...<eos> I invested my life into you, to raise you to be a great man.
Yeah.<eos> Ward...<eos> I invested my life into you, to raise you to be a great man.<eos> You've been the biggest disappointment of my life.<eos> Joy, I apologize for choosing Ward over you.
It's nonsense, really, but it kept us in line.<eos> Nobody wanted to be captured by him.<eos> You want your own personal Sack Man?<eos> Oh, not just mine.<eos> There's someone in our organization who's very anxious to work with you.
- Danny, we do what we came to do.<eos> - Is this really who you want to be?<eos> A living weapon?<eos> An assassin for K'un-Lun?<eos> Is that what your father had in mind for you when he was raising you to be Danny Rand?
And Joy?<eos> How is she?<eos> Well, she's going into surgery.<eos> She'll be fine.<eos> All thanks to you.
What hospital are you at?<eos> I'll come over.<eos> No, no need.<eos> Ward and I are here.<eos> You should get some rest.
Hey, there is no way I can repay you, Danny.<eos> You know, you freed me from the Hand.<eos> I can return to my life.<eos> With my children.<eos> All thanks to you.
That whole thing with Davos was...<eos> - Ugly.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I really screwed things up with him.<eos> I don't want the same thing to happen with you.
I don't want the same thing to happen with you.<eos> When my parents died, I... I always felt this need to find a family.<eos> At first, I... I thought it could be in K'un-Lun.<eos> And then, I thought it could be with the Meachums, but...<eos> But what I found in you is...
I really wanted to kill Bakuto.<eos> But I'm glad that in the end, it was Davos and not me, otherwise I'd spend the rest of my life wondering if I killed a man for the wrong reasons.<eos> I think that if you kill Harold out of your own vengeance... it'll corrupt your chi.<eos> You'll never be the Iron Fist you're meant to be.<eos> Which is why I have to kill Harold for you. What?
I can tell you where he made me dump the bodies.<eos> I'm not going anywhere with you.<eos> You're the one who scares me, Ward.<eos> I feel like I can't even...<eos> I can't even trust a word you say.
Great.<eos> The sooner we can get Dad locked up, the better.<eos> Why are you helping me?<eos> I'm helping me.<eos> I want Dad put away just as much as you do.
Come on. Without that fist, you're just another screwed up little kid who won't go where I go.<eos> I can go there.<eos> It's my choice!<eos> Oh, but you won't.<eos> That's why you're gonna die. Better that than to live like you.
I've been here before.<eos> Come out of the darkness so I can see you.<eos> The battle is won.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> I'm through with you, Harold.
I know.<eos> It's perfect. Tons of people started there.<eos> I know, I know.<eos> Thank you. Stop saying that. We're hiring a hundred people this month.<eos> - One of them might as well be you.
- Oh, it's like bocce but French.<eos> Oh. Tetherball, lap pool, social pool, doga.<eos> Kennel, night club, salon, maker space, rock climbing, trampoline, clinic, volleyball.<eos> Was that-- was that the...<eos> Content people, news, arts, film, engineers, management, and me, advertising, and you.
You're good, all right? Hello, I'm eamon Bailey.<eos> Thank you, thank you.<eos> So glad to see you all here.<eos> Now, a bunch of you are new to the company since I last spoke, so can the guppies all stand up?<eos> - Right. That's you.
- Okay- it's just that everyone that works at the circle is so excited to be here, and they just want to tell everyone about it all the time,<eos> - you know, it's just-- - like, "here, try this kool-aid! - Delicious!<eos> You'll love it!"<eos> Oh, wow! I love kool-aid.<eos> Don't you love kool-aid?
Thank you. You're sweet.<eos> Let me take you for dinner.<eos> You gotta eat sometime.<eos> With your camera and me looking so terrible, that sounds fantastic, but no.<eos> L just- - I'm-- I'm worried about you.
I eat, I look out the window,<eos> I come out here, I think, I daydream.<eos> Haven't done that in years.<eos> I'm glad you called.<eos> I didn't want to lose you, too.
They've broken a hundred laws. They've made me subvert a thousand regulations.<eos> - There's gotta be a way to...<eos> Stop people doing bad shit?<eos> Do you need some time away here, too? I've got an extra bed if you want it.<eos> This feels so good, just being with you, even like this.
My brother.<eos> And a dozen of my men.<eos> Over his car.<eos> And a puppy.<eos> And you... you think he will stop now?
But I do find myself here.<eos> Please.<eos> I didn't want to do this, John.<eos> Had you stayed retired, I would have respected it.<eos> Look at you.
She's in Rome, for her coronation.<eos> You will take the catacombs in...<eos> It doesn't matter where she is.<eos> That's why I need the ghost, lo spettro John Wick.<eos> That's why I need you.
Santino will lay claim to my seat at the Table.<eos> He will take New York.<eos> And you will have been the one who gifted it to him.<eos> What would your Helen think about that, John?<eos> What would your Helen think about you?
John?<eos> Cassian.<eos> You working?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You?
Perfect for every occasion.<eos> But you also gave me a choice.<eos> Pull my gun, shoot you in the back, and die, or keep the pressure on my neck... and live.<eos> And so you see, I survived.<eos> No one sneaks up on me anymore, thanks to you.
We're going to Applebee's after this.<eos> I need your help.<eos> You have eyes begging for change on every corner in the city.<eos> I'm thinking you can find Santino.<eos> I need you to move me. Underground.
Because I'm the only one that can help you.<eos> You're gonna help me out?<eos> That's downright upright of you, Mr. Wick.<eos> You sound positively magnanimous.<eos> But look around you.
We'll just have to take care of ourselves.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> For how long?<eos> And how much blood?<eos> You kill Santino, the Camorra, and the High Table come for you.
Let us toast to the future of the High Table, and of course, to the memory of my dear sister.<eos> Mr. Akoni, how are you?<eos> Wick is here.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You, and you with me.
Jt didn't tell me that.<eos> He didn't tell me a lot of things.<eos> - You know what? Let me call the girls.<eos> - No!<eos> We can put something aside for you under the radar, maybe open a little shop in town or get a place in Tahoe.
If you get impatient or rough with this mustang, mustang's gonna come out on top.<eos> Just like you and chopper in the shower, cupcake.<eos> Hey, man, get me out of here.<eos> Why I gotta go first, man?<eos> Take a breath and focus on the horse, he's more scared then you are.
It takes one phone call!<eos> I'm sorry, miss Stella, i was just joking.<eos> It won't happen again, i promise.<eos> Nice job in there.<eos> Don't pay attention to what anybody out here is saying, you keep it in the ring, you'll be fine.
Exploiting defenseless animals is irrefutably wicked.<eos> I am here to protect them at any cost.<eos> So, if you don't stop what you're doing, I will make an example out of you.<eos> Don't get timid with this horse, Irish, you do, he's gonna eat your lunch.<eos> If you get bucked off, and everybody does, roll with the throw and you keep on rolling until you're out of the way.
Debrickshaw, take that.<eos> - Jon, Jon?<eos> - How'd I do?<eos> That was awesome.<eos> Come on, let's get you up.
Octavia, water!<eos> Aren't you in here for arson?<eos> Shouldn't we help?<eos> We are helping them.<eos> - You set it on fire?
All six?<eos> Dinner's on me tonight, okay? Mmm.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Anastasia.<eos> It was you, wasn't it?
It was you, wasn't it?<eos> You just went and bought all of these?<eos> I don't like strangers gawking at you.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> For you.
Okay?<eos> Just talk, please.<eos> Have dinner with me.<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> I will have dinner with you.
I'm gonna take off.<eos> Already?<eos> Your photos are so stunning, José.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you. I'm proud of you.
The things you want, you said that's the way you are.<eos> But what happened last time, that's not gonna happen again.<eos> How can you say that?<eos> I know that I asked you to show me how far it can go, but you were getting off on the pain you inflicted.<eos> That's still in you.
What do you call it?<eos> A vanilla relationship?<eos> I mean, we only do what you're comfortable with.<eos> But you need all those things.<eos> I need you more.
Was that Mrs. Robinson?<eos> Her name's Elena Lincoln.<eos> I don't care what her name is, Christian.<eos> Why would you take me there?<eos> Why would you take me to meet the woman who seduced and abused you?
You bought the company i work for.<eos> This isn't a relationship, Christian.<eos> It's ownership.<eos> I'm trying to understand you.<eos> Lam just wanting to get close to you.
The way you wear your hat the way you sip your tea<eos> the memory of all that no, no, they can't take that away from me the way your smile just beams<eos> the way you sing off-key everybody's looking at us.<eos> Not us.<eos> You.
So do you.<eos> This dress is so beautiful.<eos> Thank you, Ana.<eos> I'm so glad you're back with Christian.<eos> He was lost without you.
$24,000.<eos> New blood!<eos> $24,000 I am bid.<eos> Do I hear $25,000?<eos> That money was for you.
Okay.<eos> Are these burns?<eos> Who did this to you?<eos> Go on, it's over.<eos> I know how difficult it is for you to open up to me and tell me these things.
But I'd like to take you there myself.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I mean, of course I would rather see New York with you.
I left everything.<eos> I don't have any of my stuff.<eos> Taylor will get it.<eos> It's fine, okay?<eos> I'll take you home, come on.
What if I gave you a key?<eos> I mean, what if you had a key, and you kept some of your stuff here?<eos> Keep all of your stuff here and you slept, you know...<eos> Not at your place.<eos> Are you asking me to move in with you?
Acting fiction editor.<eos> Till they find out how good you are.<eos> Christian, did you have something to do with this?<eos> No.<eos> Hey, it was all you.
What?<eos> You don't believe me?<eos> I don't believe it myself.<eos> I asked you a question last night.<eos> About moving in with you?
Red room, here we come.<eos> Shit.<eos> I hope you're not a sore loser.<eos> That depends on how hard you spank me.<eos> I want to be very rough with you.
Miss Steele.<eos> Damn it.<eos> Take it.<eos> I'm just gonna grab some stuff and check the mail.<eos> I should go up with you.
Hey, ros.<eos> Leila.<eos> Christian is downstairs.<eos> Do you wanna see him?<eos> I came to see you.
He told me what happened.<eos> I know you're in a lot of pain.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> He lets you call him by his name.<eos> He talks about you all the time.
I know you're in a lot of pain.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> He lets you call him by his name.<eos> He talks about you all the time.<eos> He cares about you.
Good morning.<eos> Morning.<eos> Sleep okay?<eos> I did.<eos> You?
I mean, none that I can think of.<eos> I mean, there was a little thing of asking you to marry me, but aside from that, no. Nothing.<eos> Don't mess with me like that.<eos> No?<eos> How should i mess with you?
Ls that better?<eos> I meant it.<eos> I wanna marry you.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I wanna spend every second of the rest of my life with you.
We need to have more time.<eos> You're going to have plenty of time.<eos> We're so glad that you're here with us and in Christian's life.<eos> You've made such a difference to him.<eos> He never let anyone get close until you came along.
You've made such a difference to him.<eos> He never let anyone get close until you came along.<eos> Grace, he adores you.<eos> I know, but children grow apart from their parents, and that's fine, as long as they're happy.<eos> And he is happy with you.
Thank you.<eos> Do you still have that gift I gave you?<eos> Yes.<eos> You know you didn't have to.<eos> All I want is you.
Yes, yes, yes.<eos> Wait!<eos> So this whole time I had the answer in my pocket?<eos> Anastasia Steele...<eos> What am I gonna do with you?
I know that we haven't been together very long,<eos> but I love him so much.<eos> He's the one.<eos> Oh, sweetheart!<eos> I'm so happy for you!
Oh, please.<eos> Come here.<eos> So, how does it feel to bag Seattle's most eligible bachelor?<eos> It's a little scary, but...<eos> Well, if anyone can make it work, it's you.
You're just a mousy little thing after his money.<eos> He's not capable of marriage.<eos> Thank you, Christian.<eos> Why are you even here, Elena?<eos> She's not right for you.
I'm done.<eos> The business.<eos> Everything.<eos> I'll have my people sort out the details tomorrow.<eos> I know she was important to you.
Come with me.<eos> There's something I need to show you.<eos> Last time we came down here, i was over your shoulder.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> After you.
Yes.<eos> Marry me.<eos> I'll marry you.<eos> Give me your hand.<eos> Did you do that?
I'll take a last look around.<eos> They lost us.<eos> -Are you coming?<eos> You-<eos> - You want me to come with you?
- You said, "Omar."<eos> - You just said it!<eos> -What?<eos> I didn't say Omar.<eos> You said Omar. -You just said it again!
Don't answer.<eos> It's obvious.<eos> So fresh, so pure.<eos> She's adorable.<eos> I see great things for you, for us.
Are you insane?<eos> A Dustie in love with my sister?<eos> I mean, besides, look at your skin.<eos> You haven't even shed yet.<eos> You have a better chance of dying in-in-in this place than anything ever happening between the two of you two.
But, if you still want to escape, I know a way.<eos> You really want me out of here, don't you?<eos> Sooner or later, Omar is going to make us dance against each other.<eos> I'd just rather skip that part.<eos> All you have to do is drop onto the sand without a sound.
Had none of the questions they told us to prepare.<eos> I'm sure you did your best.<eos> - When's French? Thursday is it? - Yeah.<eos> Feel like I can't remember anything even though I've had a year longer than everyone else.<eos> We're proud of you, you know, for sticking at it.
Okay?<eos> Is everybody clear on that?<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Good.<eos> Mary, can you stand up please?
One way or another, we all end up back together in the end.<eos> That's what you're asking, right?<eos> Yep.<eos> Okay.<eos> Find something else to worry about, will you?
Roberta, would you like to have Mary tonight?<eos> Why wouldn't I like to have Mary tonight?<eos> I told you something like this would happen.<eos> Now look where we are.<eos> And I'm supposed to believe you know what you're doing.
I can't do this.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> I understand.<eos> I'll take you home.
God!<eos> Damn it!<eos> Can I just get five minutes of my own life?<eos> Nothing that happened today was your fault.<eos> I got mad at you... I was really mad at me.
Wow!<eos> You and my mom... were always together.<eos> Always.<eos> Oh, no, you don't want to look at that one.<eos> Is that you?
It's big.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why are you so mad all of a sudden?<eos> I'm not mad. I'm annoyed.<eos> Not with you, dear. With that pompous ass, Shankland.
Doesn't even wanna see what I look like.<eos> All right.<eos> Hey, put your shoes on.<eos> We're going for a ride.<eos> You too.
I want my crummy school.<eos> - And you got Fred.<eos> - Please.<eos> And once a month you can come back. You can stay with me and Roberta.<eos> I want you and Roberta now!
- Please.<eos> And once a month you can come back. You can stay with me and Roberta.<eos> I want you and Roberta now!<eos> And in a few years, if you want... you can come back. You can live with me.<eos> I wanna stay with you.
I know.<eos> No!<eos> Frank!<eos> Don't go!<eos> I need you!
No!<eos> Frank!<eos> Don't go!<eos> I need you!<eos> Fred needs you!
You said you wouldn't leave me.<eos> I made a mistake.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I was so sad!<eos> I missed you.
I made a mistake.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I was so sad!<eos> I missed you.<eos> I missed you, too.
It wasn't her death she was talking about.<eos> I tried to talk her out of it.<eos> But you know how Diane could be when she made her mind up about something.<eos> I called MIT.<eos> Shankland's out of his mind about the possibility of publishing it with you.
Wait for me to die?<eos> I know Diane was hard.<eos> I know she was angry.<eos> But something really good came out of this, Evelyn.<eos> She needs you now.
There will be no training.<eos> What if I promise to be careful?<eos> It's time to sleep.<eos> What if I didn't use a sword?<eos> Fighting does not make you a hero.
It's beautiful.<eos> Who would be wield it?<eos> I pray it will never be called to arms.<eos> But only the fiercest among us even could.<eos> And that's not you, Diana.
Hippolyta, I love her as you do.<eos> But this is the only way to truly protect her.<eos> You will train her harder than any Amazon before her.<eos> Five times harder... ten times harder.<eos> Until she's better than even you.
no!<eos> - No!<eos> - Anti­ope!<eos> No!<eos> - You.
Like you once did.<eos> You know that if you choose to leave... you may never return.<eos> Who will I be if I stay?<eos> This belonged to the greatest warrior in our history... our beloved Anti­ope.<eos> Make sure you're worthy of it.
Great.<eos> You will see.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Oh, I thought maybe you wanna... get some sleep.<eos> What about you?
Not very often, no.<eos> Then why do they do it?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> So you cannot sleep with me unless<eos> - I marry you.. - I...
I sleep with you if you want.<eos> - I'll sleep right there.<eos> - There is plenty of room.<eos> - Then fine, if you don't mind...<eos> - No, it's up to you.
Diana, Sameer!<eos> Hi, Diana.<eos> You can call me Sammy please.<eos> "Sammy".<eos> Oh Sameer, I wouldn't... do that if I were you.
- Okay, You have no money.<eos> - No.<eos> All I want right now is a picture of your lovely face.<eos> You won't need a picture...<eos> I'm coming with you.
Very reputable.<eos> A liar, a murderer, and now a smuggler.<eos> Lovely.<eos> Careful, I might get offended.<eos> I wasn't referring to you.
- Women and children!<eos> - We need to make our<eos> - next position by sunset.<eos> - How can you say that?<eos> What is the matter with you?
- Too dangerous?<eos> - Yes, too dangerous.<eos> And you are too distracting.<eos> Look, I will go in there, to find.. where ever they are working on the gas or better yet, where it is.<eos> - I'm coming with you.
What if you're wrong?<eos> What if there's no Ares?<eos> You don't believe me.<eos> I can not let you do this.<eos> What I do is not up to you.
- No!<eos> - Get away from me!<eos> I understand everything now.<eos> It isn't just the Germans that Ares has corrupted.<eos> It's you too.
As magnificent as you are, you are still no match for me.<eos> We'll see about that.<eos> I am Diana of Temiscira... daughter of Hippolyta... Queen of the Amazons.<eos> And your wrath upon this world is over.<eos> In the name of all that it is good in this world... I hereby complete the mission of the Amazons... to ridding this world of you... forever!
Please don't do this, Understand my problem.<eos> You know I can't make living without my car.<eos> Isn't my problem bro.<eos> Dominic Toretto..<eos> I heard about you.
You're gonna betray your brothers, abandon your code, shatter your family.<eos> See, your team..<eos> Is about to go up against the only thing they can't handle.<eos> What's that?<eos> You.
So you just gonna keep that to yourself?<eos> What happen to Phase 1?<eos> What about that part?<eos> Yeah, remember the airplane?<eos> Everyone drove their cars out but you.
There are no back room deals.<eos> Got myself into this, I'm gonna get myself out of it.<eos> You know that.<eos> I do and that's what I told them.<eos> Well, there you have it.
Welcome to the club.<eos> I wouldn't get that twisted son.<eos> We ain't in no club.<eos> We got nothing in common.<eos> And unlike you, I ain't gonna be here long.
I wouldn't get that twisted son.<eos> We ain't in no club.<eos> We got nothing in common.<eos> And unlike you, I ain't gonna be here long.<eos> You bring the shovel did you?
A pair for every occasion.<eos> There's enough guns here to outfit a small army.<eos> Huh?<eos> Oh this is just the tip of the iceberg.<eos> You know what I like about you, Dom.
- Family.<eos> - No, it's not.<eos> But if you're being honest?<eos> It's the 10 seconds between start and finish, when you're not thinking about anything.<eos> No family, not obligations, just you.
Being free.<eos> I gotta tell you.<eos> This whole saving the world... Robin Hood nonsense you've been doing recently...<eos> It's bullshit.<eos> It's not you.
I gotta tell you.<eos> This whole saving the world... Robin Hood nonsense you've been doing recently...<eos> It's bullshit.<eos> It's not you.<eos> Be who you are.
Well I got plenty of goal.<eos> You must have misplaced that.<eos> When I kicked your ass up in down that office of yours.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Just like you Brits, rewriting History, huh?
You all made interpol's top 10 most wanted list.<eos> Top 10?<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> That's alright.<eos> Well, not you.
Nice to see you again.<eos> Look at this, bodies not even cold Dom.<eos> Your family's already replacing you.<eos> You chose the loosing team.<eos> I guess your brother is smarter than you.
See papa.<eos> Papa.<eos> When I realized I was pregnant.<eos> You had just find out Letty was alive.<eos> So I decided when Letty and you go back from your honeymoon.
It's to kill your son.<eos> And that's a lot of bullets.<eos> And it only takes one for you to loose everything.<eos> So, I have to ask you, because...<eos> I know family is so important to you.
I want every with chip with the GEODIE exploits in a two mile radius around that motorcade now.<eos> There's over a thousands of them.<eos> Hack 'em all.<eos> It's zombie time.<eos> I'd buckle up if I were you.
He's got an EMP and nuclear launch codes.<eos> I don't know what it is, but they're building towards something.<eos> Deckard?<eos> He didn't make it.<eos> I'm disappointed in you, Dom.
The wife it is.<eos> Nice plane.<eos> I'm gonna enjoy her remains.<eos> You don't go get any ideas.<eos> You and planes don't have a good history.
- Roman, here comes the bad part.<eos> - What?<eos> Hang in there guys!<eos> We're almost through the lock.<eos> It's easy for you to say, when your ass ain't on fire.
Where is that smile?<eos> There it is!<eos> You're gonna shoot a baby You shoud bust it...<eos> You aren't gonna wanna see this?<eos> Is that you or him?
I knew you wanted revenge.<eos> Glad I did it.<eos> Can't believe you went to see my Mother.<eos> Come on.<eos> All this fuss of you.
From the Beast.<eos> What's up, Wood?<eos> Man, good to see you, brother.<eos> Welcome.<eos> That's for you, man.
No! Hey, hey, hey!<eos> Money, we gotta go!<eos> Let's go!<eos> Go, go, go, go, go!<eos> You ain't inked.
Look, I know, okay?<eos> Dante was sick, and my mom...<eos> Hey, hey, I don't wanna hear about any of that.<eos> No excuses.<eos> You said you want a plan B, instead of wasting the rest of your life.
Have a seat.<eos> You have a beautiful family.<eos> Thank you, homes.<eos> Appreciate it.<eos> What about you? You got a lady, got kids?
Appreciate it.<eos> What about you? You got a lady, got kids?<eos> Used to.<eos> The world went on without us, huh?<eos> Feel for you, homes.
You know, it's just between work and being a mom, it's...<eos> It's fine. It is what it is.<eos> Why'd you send him that letter?<eos> Josh thought you were committing suicide.<eos> This is for you.
I'm not taking it.<eos> No, it's yours now.<eos> I'm not taking your gang money! Just keep it down.<eos> Don't tell me what to do. You don't get to do that.<eos> I don't hear from you for seven years.
Take it to yard tomorrow.<eos> How?<eos> In your fucking ass, man.<eos> Make sure you lube-up, too.<eos> You don't want this shit breaking off inside you.
No, it's just that's not a lot of time, you know.<eos> We have no idea what we're walking into.<eos> I'm just trying to protect you, that's all.<eos> Shit, man, you got it. You got it, bro.<eos> I'm here for you, man.
I'm trying to help you out, man.<eos> And I'm here. I'm fucking here, man.<eos> I'm fucking here. I done everything you asked me to do.<eos> I can't help it if he ain't giving me shit...<eos> And I can't help you and your old lady if you don't give me shit. It's simple.
Frank, listen to me.<eos> I'm gonna say it one time, all right?<eos> If your fucking cell phone loses its signal even for a millisecond-be quiet.<eos> Then I'm kicking your trafficking charges up to DEA.<eos> All my friends there gonna take care of you and Monica real well. Fair time.
All of that went through my head, too, when I first broke my cherry.<eos> And then I realized none of that matters.<eos> The only thing that matters is you getting home to your family in one piece.<eos> This guy's a monster, brother.<eos> Make sure you're with me.
- The fact is we all started out as someone's little angel.<eos> And a place like this forces us to become warriors or victims.<eos> Nothing in between can exist here.<eos> And you've chosen to be a warrior.<eos> Now it's up to you to remain one.
That's worse, man.<eos> Sure as hell have seen my share of violence, man, but when you're in it... when you're on the other end... that's a whole different ball game, brother.<eos> Look, man, I've never been in an actual gunfight myself... so I'm not gonna sit here and tell you I know what you're going through, because I don't.<eos> But what I do know is that there's a young girl out there who's safe right now.<eos> And that's because of you.
What I wanted to hear.<eos> But keep your ink clean so they can't validate you.<eos> That's how we lull the enemy to sleep.<eos> I understand.<eos> You have the keys out here now.
Keep driving.<eos> What!<eos> What's wrong, Money?<eos> How many guns did you tell Shotgun you had total?<eos> Same as I told you!
He was gonna throw you under the bus with me.<eos> Has that been taken care of?<eos> - And the youngster who stashed the extra guns.<eos> Don't worry, I know where they're hidden.<eos> I figure, we make everyone happy with this deal... then you and I split the rest.
I already pleaded guilty to the guns.<eos> Let me do my time like a man.<eos> You see, that's what I don't get.<eos> I've been around long enough to know when a con's making moves simply to survive or when it's that rare breed... the one that relishes in the power.<eos> But that's not you.
I've been around long enough to know when a con's making moves simply to survive or when it's that rare breed... the one that relishes in the power.<eos> But that's not you.<eos> Not by a long shot.<eos> Why you throwing your whole life away?<eos> Look, I don't know what they're holding over you... but I can offer you something better.
- Well, I'm just saying.<eos> Sorry.<eos> - Okay, well, this is it.<eos> - Great. As you can see, it's a very nice establishment.<eos> And, uh, you'll be home in no time.
Okay, hands, pal!<eos> Let me see your hands!<eos> I said hands, now, get them up!<eos> Aw, Jesus.<eos> Oh, Bill, it's you. Jesus, how you doing, man?
Oh, Bill, it's you. Jesus, how you doing, man?<eos> Steve, what the hell are you doing out here?<eos> Aren't you tired of this Peter Pan bullshit?<eos> This is no kind of life, you're an old man.<eos> Why don't you just meet somebody your own age and make a life, for God sakes?
- Sorry, this is it right here.<eos> Oh, well, let's see what this photo is all about.<eos> This is me as a kid. Look, seven years old right there.<eos> I'm holding the dog.<eos> - That's you?
Yeah, sure, definitely, I'll find some graffiti artists.<eos> - You should get more of this coffee, too.<eos> - Yep, definitely.<eos> Steve...<eos> I need you.
That a boy.<eos> Go knock on the door.<eos> How ya doin'?<eos> I'm okay.<eos> How are you?
- It's a nervous disorder.<eos> Now, if you change your mind...<eos> Mocha will turn you out.<eos> I will noodle on that.<eos> Oh, I'm gonna noodle on you.
Brings out the color in your eyes.<eos> - So, a day? - One day.<eos> All right.<eos> Remind him of the due date, huh?<eos> I'm pretty sure that's you, Lew, I just don't know what happened to you.
- Hey, Yuri.<eos> Thank you very much, very much.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> You're a man of your word, huh?<eos> You, too.
Dude, I'm standing right here. - I can hear every word he says. - Shut the fuck up!<eos> - Hey, hey, don't talk to him like that.<eos> - You shut the fuck up! I'm cool.<eos> We're all good.<eos> - You and your dog's time is running out.
We're gonna stand up, you ready?<eos> Come on.<eos> There you go. Come on.<eos> Shit just got real.<eos> You, put your gun down, put your gun down.
You see what's happening here, don't you?<eos> For the first time in your life, Katey and Taylor you're putting them and their needs before your own.<eos> Now me, I'm doing the totally opposite thing.<eos> I'm putting my needs before anyone else's for the first time in my life.<eos> I've become you, and you've become me.
And it turns out, we both have a passion for vintage cinema, so...<eos> - So we're all good here?<eos> - Yeah, we're cool.<eos> - And?<eos> We owe you, Steve and if there's anything you need, you could come see us.
- It's that Muffin motherfucker, man!<eos> He's back, took a shot at me!<eos> Watch the windows, I'll find that muffinfucker!<eos> Drop the gun.<eos> Does Spyder know you and Lupe stole all the drugs?
They attend the funeral of a widower 'cause they know there'll be lots of old men.<eos> And that animal from Africa is here to pick at an old man's bones, too.<eos> Perhaps we should let Thoyt deal with the matter.<eos> Let's call our carriage.<eos> One thing Africa did not cure... is that I still love you.
Get off me.<eos> - Begging your pardon, sir.<eos> - What, why?<eos> Begging your pardon, but what the hell are you doing here?<eos> Oh, no, there will be no pardon for you because you are the captain of the mutineers.
Oh, no, there will be no pardon for you because you are the captain of the mutineers.<eos> And you will hang.<eos> For being a pirate, you vagabond!<eos> How's the leg?<eos> I broke my left knee swinging from a tree, being an ape for you.
They should have invited you.<eos> To the wake, at least.<eos> Serving stew in the backroom, to hell with that.<eos> In all of this dirty city, there is no-one that I can trust, do you understand?<eos> Apart from you.
You become half mad yourself.<eos> But here's the thing, James.<eos> This Nootka Sound is a curse.<eos> It will bring the King and Empire down upon your head.<eos> Please don't talk to me of sense, Brace, because if it is you, I might believe it.
Thoyt has been trying to buy the Delaney Shipping Company from your father for three years.<eos> Each time, your da would go into the street, scoop up some horse shite and package it up by way of reply.<eos> I imagine the envelope contains a financial offer.<eos> I imagine it does.<eos> Do you have any horse shit on you?
You want a bush, you come through me.<eos> That is private property.<eos> Helga, it's so good to see that you're still working...<eos> Even still alive.<eos> You know that I lay with you when I was just a little boy.
People who do not know me soon come to understand that I do not have any sense.<eos> Now, please do not misunderstand the situation.<eos> You send me 12 men, I will return you 12 sets of testicles in a bag, and we can watch your little whores devour them together, before I chop off your trotters and boil them.<eos> Two hours.<eos> You...
Now, please do not misunderstand the situation.<eos> You send me 12 men, I will return you 12 sets of testicles in a bag, and we can watch your little whores devour them together, before I chop off your trotters and boil them.<eos> Two hours.<eos> You...<eos> I remember you.
I'd hoped to settle this matter in a modern way, but that's not going to be possible.<eos> He's all yours.<eos> Dear James, the letter I sent to you this morning was written under the supervision of my husband, to whom I am happily married.<eos> It is more than ten years since you went away, and at the time I was grateful that you had decided to leave England, for both of our sakes.<eos> Whatever happens with this business of inheritance, and no matter if it results in a dispute, I hope I can trust you to keep the secrets of the past buried, buried in a deeper grave.
James Keziah Delaney.<eos> Dear Lord Almighty, is that your brother? !<eos> Your father was poisoned.<eos> I would say heavy doses over a short period.<eos> One thing Africa did not cure is that I still love you.
Who, who did, sir?<eos> The fucking Americans!<eos> Atticus!<eos> James Delaney.<eos> Well, look at you.
I would kill for a mulatto - the Danish pay double.<eos> I met her.<eos> People are saying you're mad.<eos> I like to see what lies beneath.<eos> You have goodness in you.
I like to see what lies beneath.<eos> You have goodness in you.<eos> What goodness?<eos> You do, you do.<eos> You have goodness in you - I can see it in your eyes... and you have the same eyes as her.
They feel deeply aggrieved and talk of seizures.<eos> I'm not being at all fanciful when I ask if you are armed.<eos> I am armed.<eos> There he is!<eos> Shame on you!
My father was a very sick and old man.<eos> Do you have proof of consummation?<eos> I have letters, many letters professing his feelings for me.<eos> A line from memory is...<eos> "Lorna, it is in a moment" "that I would leave this cursed house by the river" "and go to the Americas with you and live there, naked and savage,"
There are no practical difficulties.<eos> Apart from that great big river that connects us.<eos> Did you really eat flesh?<eos> Why don't you tell your friends that you're sick and you can come and hear everything?<eos> I would laugh at you, but you're not well.
Go and wash your hands.<eos> No need for any more questions.<eos> Not when half of London will be retelling the story anyway.<eos> So I shall hear through gossip?<eos> As I hear about you.
You've been following me, haven't you?<eos> Now.<eos> Are you King or are you Company?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> Now there is nothing up that road for you apart from death and anybody like you.
Why?<eos> Well, it's a personal campaign.<eos> A stab in my ribs.<eos> Now, you will deal with it.<eos> You and the Africa Desk.?
All was ordered and calm and now there is this thing that demands attention.<eos> Stops you sleeping, belches, farts, screams... and she's going to make this whole process louder and wilder, more insane, more impractical... and the only thing that will stop this entire enterprise from erupting in a giant explosion the size of Mauritius is this... and dedication.<eos> Because, from now on, until the powder is complete, we have to stir.<eos> Continuously!<eos> You.

Read.<eos> Come now, all is forgotten, all is forgotten.<eos> How ridiculous it's all been.<eos> Duelling.<eos> And you and I fighting like children.
What?<eos> Nothing.<eos> You stay here.<eos> I will tell Brace to arrange a carriage.<eos> By the time you get home, the body will be gone.
How, how did he know?<eos> Oh, God!<eos> Very well.<eos> We will allow him to think he is one step ahead... while we exploit what is undefended.<eos> And to you, your church on Earth and in Heaven, we offer honour and glory, now and for ever.
James, what are you doing?<eos> Go away.<eos> I'm not fit to be near you now.<eos> Dear Lord, we are gathered in your presence here today on this most sorrowful occasion to say farewell to Winter.<eos> Cured of her love of the world, untouched, pure, commended to God... she will not be covered in earth as corrupted flesh, but instead will be sent to you, O Lord... aboard a sunrise...

In return, the Royal Commission will offer you a full pardon for your crime.<eos> For crime... it is.<eos> I have an alternative suggestion.<eos> In.<eos> I have a use for you.
I know.<eos> Where are they now?<eos> A safe house.<eos> I have the address.<eos> I have a use for you.
They are going to hang you.<eos> No, their case will flounder.<eos> They can't.<eos> And we can make this happen.<eos> You and me.
Splash.<eos> And down he floats... directly into Winter's arms.<eos> So I cut out your spoils.<eos> Take it.<eos> It's for you.
- No.<eos> Explain this.<eos> I have the very same mark on me... from when I was taken prisoner in Africa.<eos> What is it?<eos> You tell me.
- If I were caught...<eos> - What?<eos> If I were caught passing company secrets to a Delaney...<eos> You're not going to get caught because I will protect you.<eos> You know, at the seminary, I was in love with you.
Your leaving England was the click of the hypnotist's fingers.<eos> I woke from a trance and realised the depth of our sin.<eos> I have found forgiveness in God and in my husband, and I want no part in your plans or your future.<eos> But we are the future.<eos> Your husband is already passed and you can see that by the way that he follows you.
Can't we go any faster, carl?<eos> I want to get us there in one piece, shelly.<eos> Oh, carl. I know there's been trouble in that trailer.<eos> We've all heard it.<eos> And I feel for you and your girl, okay, shelly?
Every kid should have a gym set.<eos> There you go, brother.<eos> A toast.<eos> Oh... dougie.<eos> Here's to you, dougie.
Thank God Gordon stocks the plane from his own wine cellar.<eos> No, you'll be the one to tell her.
Yes, sir.<eos> Hello, Sarah.<eos> Hawk.<eos> Been meaning to stop by.<eos> Some old cases popped up, and I thought about you.
We'll figure it out.<eos> But for now, I'd really like to get back to this fine Bordeaux.<eos> What kind is it?<eos> 11:05.<eos> Albert sometimes I really worry about you.
Are you coming with me?<eos> Audrey, look at this paperwork I have, and I've got a deadline.<eos> Look, stacks of it.<eos> How can I leave this and go out so late at night?<eos> I want to find Billy same as you, but... can't we start out in the light of day?
It's already late, and I'm getting sleepy.<eos> I have so much more work to do before I get to sleep.<eos> You poor fucking thing.<eos> I told you, don't talk that way to your husband.<eos> I've been good to you.
I have so much more work to do before I get to sleep.<eos> You poor fucking thing.<eos> I told you, don't talk that way to your husband.<eos> I've been good to you.<eos> You always say it, how I've been good to you.
I got to find Tina.<eos> She was the last person to see Billy, and I can't fucking stand being in the same room with her.<eos> You were supposed to call her, but you never did.<eos> Don't be sore at me, Audrey.<eos> You know I just want the best for you.
Renege on a contract?<eos> That's what I will do.<eos> That's what I'm doing.<eos> Okay, Audrey.<eos> I'll go with you.
- We'll do it.<eos> - Together.<eos> Wait, so are you two...<eos> About time.<eos> - I have something for you?
- The Lost Woods?<eos> I put the deed in your name. Yours and Alison's.<eos> I'd like to go over the major points one more time.<eos> - I killed Dr. Dunhill.<eos> - She did this for you.
Why do we miss A so much?<eos> Because without fear, there can be no courage.<eos> - Who said that?<eos> - Christopher Paolini.<eos> I never would've guessed it was you.
I'm fine.<eos> Is Addison bullying you?<eos> She's not.<eos> I'm fine. I'm just late for class.<eos> Addison, is that you?
You guys. It's beautiful.<eos> I thought we were gonna have a kegger.<eos> - Well, me too.<eos> - My vote got shot down.<eos> Well, since we can't go with you on your honeymoon...
- I could use your help.<eos> How many people does it take to make mojito?<eos> Two.<eos> What's going on?<eos> You and Caleb are sitting so far apart that you could be in different time zones.
But, seriously though, after all this group has been through<eos> I don't think marriage is going to be that hard.<eos> That's because you haven't had kids yet.<eos> This is our first time out in months.<eos> Exactly, which is why you and I should go back to our room.
It's the leaves of a shrub that you chew like tobacco.<eos> Okay.<eos> Still reading the dictionary for fun?<eos> Everything okay?<eos> You know I'm here for you, right?
But I try and keep my spirits up.<eos> I try not to lose hope.<eos> You can say it.<eos> Hope breeds eternal misery.<eos> Well, the old Spencer would have agreed with you but... I don't believe that anymore.
Wow, this is, um...<eos> Cheers.<eos> I never asked for your blessing.<eos> Well, if that's what's happening now, I gotta say you've left it down to the wire.<eos> I never asked because I never really felt like you and Ella truly accepted me.
I never asked for your blessing.<eos> Well, if that's what's happening now, I gotta say you've left it down to the wire.<eos> I never asked because I never really felt like you and Ella truly accepted me.<eos> Well, you, you never really worked to prove us wrong.<eos> You never made a persuasive argument as to why we should feel good about you as a soninlaw.
- Cheers.<eos> So, when do I get to meet the girls?<eos> Anytime you wanna babysit.<eos> With four girls in the house, we could use a nanny.<eos> Hey, call it whatever you want just know I'm always here for you.
Limerance.<eos> I looked it up.<eos> You did?<eos> Kind of unrequited love.<eos> Thank you for driving, sweetheart.
I thought that we were supposed to go through these things together...<eos> Yeah, I was scared.<eos> II thought that maybe this was something that you couldn't get past.<eos> Wow, if you think so little of me why do you still wanna marry me?<eos> It wasn't about you, it was about me.
Okay. Come upstairs, let's talk.<eos> No, I...<eos> I think what I need is sleep.<eos> We're gonna be okay.<eos> I just wish that you had as much faith in me as I have in you.
- I can't tell.<eos> It's either a really bad comedy about chefs or a really good infomercial about deep fryers.<eos> Can we talk?<eos> I don't know what else to say, Hanna.<eos> The decisions you make don't just affect you.
You could just leave the cart outside.<eos> Coffee?<eos> At this hour?<eos> You'll be up all night.<eos> Toby, is that you?
Officer Maple, if she does try and contact us.<eos> II promise we'll let you know immediately.<eos> You should know she's probably not alone.<eos> She needed help to get out.<eos> So you and your friends should stay vigilant.
I didn't even know about Mary Drake.<eos> At first, I thought Wren was putting me on.<eos> But then he pulled out his phone showed me your picture.<eos> I still don't know why, but I started to cry.<eos> He just ran into you?
Melissa was already out of the picture.<eos> She was dating some composer.<eos> So he was fair game.<eos> I guess you could say he has a type.<eos> You know, first her, then you, then her, then me.
I wanted it on my own terms.<eos> Wren let me come to Rosewood alone 'cause he knew that I would come back to him.<eos> And after I found out who killed Charlotte that's just what I did.<eos> Yet here you are.<eos> Now I know this isn't fun for you but it's very exciting for me.
Toby, can I kiss you?<eos> Just one last time.<eos> Just to say goodbye.<eos> Like mother, like daughter.<eos> That's what you and Mary were arguing about.
I know you loved your sister, but...<eos> No, those bitches took her away from me and now they're getting everything that they deserve.<eos> I'm honoring her.<eos> Don't you get that?<eos> I get everything about you.
- Pleasure.<eos> I made good on my promise to Wren that night.<eos> And when the game was over, I went back to London.<eos> But I just...<eos> I couldn't stop thinkin' about you.
About how good you have it.<eos> About how much your friends love you.<eos> And it was just driving me mad and, and Wren saw it happening.<eos> Alex, you mean everything to me.<eos> I even created lies for you, but this is too much...
You have your daddy's eyes.<eos> Yeah, I knew Wren would make pretty babies.<eos> Yes.<eos> So you're part of this too?<eos> No, I'm trapped in here just like you.
No, I'm trapped in here just like you.<eos> Yeah, well, you don't look so trapped to me.<eos> I'm a wanted convict for Archie Dunhill's murder.<eos> A crime I didn't commit, remember?<eos> I took the blame for you and your friends so I think I deserve a little trust.
There is nothing more that I would love than to hold you, Spencer but she would never forgive me if you got out.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - You don't have to thank me.<eos> I'm your mother.<eos> Aria, this isn't about you.
I meant your head.<eos> Sorry, sarcasm is my brain's selfdefense mechanism for whenever I'm about to be murdered.<eos> That was Spencer.<eos> She's gonna swing by the apartment and get you something to wear.<eos> My mom's sleeping over, so we're gonna stay with you, okay?
Can we have some privacy, please?<eos> Wait, wait, no, no.<eos> Stop. Stop.<eos> Look, we both understand why you became A.D.<eos> You and I actually met once.
Of course, I can.<eos> And you have Mary to thank for that.<eos> She saved you at the blind school and she's saving you now.<eos> So that wasn't just Jenna and Noel.<eos> - That was you and Sydney.
Her name's Alex Drake, just like the birth certificate you found in your mom's Radley file.<eos> I found 12 Alex Drakes and I'm not related to any of them.<eos> Yeah, wait till you see her.<eos> Do we really look that much alike?<eos> She looks a lot like someone just not you.
I am the power.<eos> Don't you get it?<eos> No. I don't.<eos> I won't be gone for long, I promise.<eos> Then let me come with you.
It'll be too hard to say goodbye to you.<eos> I almost forgot.<eos> It's my favorite.<eos> I love you, Alex.<eos> I'll always take care of you.
Wait.<eos> So I'm still alive because I'm your sister but what's gonna happen to Ezra?<eos> Well, he's not family, so...<eos> Enjoy his company while you can.<eos> I think that you and I are gonna be the closest of all.
Let's take a motherdaughter trip to Europe.<eos> No!<eos> I'm not going anywhere without Toby.<eos> Right, I see it in his eyes he's in love with me.<eos> He's in love with Spencer, not you.
Yeah, um, Jason said that he's got that veteran's program in Philly.<eos> Yeah, if it works out, they should, um get a lot of homeless people off the streets.<eos> Yeah, and Toby is gonna keep climbing into your sheets.<eos> Sorry, are you already honeymoon drunk?<eos> - No! I'm, I'm happy for you.
Congratulations.<eos> You're okay with that, right?<eos> Hanna, of course.<eos> That's amazing.<eos> Besides, we're right behind you.
- Okay.<eos> Here to fight a goddamn war, not watch goddamn television.<eos> Willy was the first person that Glen saw every morning and the last person he saw every night.<eos> Glen loved these men... and they loved him right back.<eos> I don't know how it looks to you, Cory, but it seems to me, everybody's forgotten we're fighting a war here.
Sweet.<eos> Yeah, my wife, too. She's got one.<eos> We both have one. We love it.<eos> My first car was a Taurus. My father bought it.<eos> What do you got?
And I don't know how to do that, sir, when every second one of them or every third one of them or every tenth one of them is trying to fucking kill me, sir.<eos> 'Cause I'm a marine. 'Cause we're marines.<eos> And it seem like now they handing out medals for heroically not being a marine, sir.<eos> I'm confused, is what I'm trying to say, sir.<eos> Well, then you're just gonna have to get yourself unconfused, son.
Now he wants fucking face time. Fucking dick.<eos> So can you do that, boss?<eos> Then we can jet across to Copenhagen at zero six.<eos> The president's gonna be on the tarmac at 8:30.<eos> Well, you're the keeper of my schedule, Cory.
- Okay, thank you, Willy.<eos> Well, we're in Paris.<eos> Yeah. Hopefully we'll get to see some sights.<eos> Yeah, I'll have Cory schedule some time.<eos> - Okay... but you do what you gotta do, because I am here for you.
Because you're acting crazy! You're acting like a fucking lunatic right now!<eos> You think this is crazy, huh?<eos> - You think this is me being crazy?<eos> - Peter! Calm down!<eos> You fucking calm down!
EverywhereBartwent, he was given star treatment.<eos> At school at the public pool...<eos> It's really not that dangerous.<eos> ...with local merchants.<eos> Oh, young basketball star, I have something special for you.
Did you know I once took a train halfway across Cleveland?<eos> This is not a video trick.<eos> He really just stopped moving, but Bart had just gotten started.<eos> You could be an accessory to a crime, you know.<eos> Are you letting your anger at Dad make you into a patsy for the mob?
Shoot!<eos> Just like I drew it up!<eos> Okay, here's a shot:<eos> you're not bald, your hair left out of embarrassment.<eos> Why, you little...!
...the fans!<eos> All right, let me hear your side.<eos> Sorry, my side is exclusive to my charity,<eos> The American Fart Association.<eos> Why, you little...!
I was a jerk.<eos> The good thing about being a kid is you get to make mistakes so you don't make them as an adult.<eos> Thanks, Dad.<eos> But don't you still make mistakes?<eos> The best one was you, son.
- Where'd you move here from? - Just Santa Cruz.<eos> I was up there with my parents.<eos> You know she does part-time bookkeeping as well.<eos> Isn't that great?<eos> You know, I work at the theater, and whenever we go into production, we hire freelance accountants, so I'll ask them if they have anything for you.
You think she should keep all her emotions bottled up inside?<eos> - Who does that serve?<eos> - "Am I missing the math?"<eos> Bitch.<eos> Can't she see that it has nothing to do with you?
Good for them to learn a language, you know?<eos> I just thought it was nice for the nannies to get to know each other and have your own little support system.<eos> Renata, Jane is not a nanny.<eos> She's a mom, just young.<eos> Like you used to be? - Maddie.
And, yes, I reacted.<eos> Humanly, like any mom would.<eos> And then, I'm met with utter contempt.<eos> Look, I'm sure there are those, women especially, who would resent you.<eos> I mean, look at you. Come on.
Career-wise.<eos> Okay, well, let's just finish that analogy. Let's not leave Bonnie out of this.<eos> Her little cup just runneth over with happiness, doesn't it?<eos> With no college degree at all.<eos> I'm sorry that you hate Bonnie and that I'm unable to.
With no college degree at all.<eos> I'm sorry that you hate Bonnie and that I'm unable to.<eos> I don't hate Bonnie.<eos> And this isn't about your dad or Bonnie or me.<eos> This is about you, Abigail, and your future.
It's not like I'm going anywhere.<eos> Sorry about the village.<eos> But it's just the same old village, though.<eos> I know.<eos> And I'd give up a million villages just to be with you here forever.
Okay, Mother.<eos> I'm just coming.<eos> I'll... I'll be right there.<eos> Norman?<eos> Is that you?
Mother, I'm not thinking anything.<eos> She is just a nice girl.<eos> Would it really be that awful if I had a friend?<eos> Here we go.<eos> Mother, what is wrong with you?
Well, let me see, for...<eos> Let's see, for starters,<eos> I am dead.<eos> And why am I pretending to be dead?<eos> So I could get away from everyone and everything that could distract me from you, okay?
So I could get away from everyone and everything that could distract me from you, okay?<eos> I know that, and I appreciate it.<eos> You appreciate it?<eos> Appreciate, like I baked you a coffee cake or something?<eos> I spend 24/7 in this house looking after you, feeding you, bolstering your moods, doing your laundry.
I'll miss most of it.<eos> I think I'm gonna drive.<eos> Mother... get back in that house right now.<eos> You should not be out here.<eos> Well, you shouldn't be driving.
Norman, you do not have autonomy here.<eos> You can't just make unilateral decisions about everybody else, like you're the little dictator.<eos> I am just driving to a meeting.<eos> I know what you're doing, and I know why you're doing it.<eos> I know everything about you...
I don't know, Norman!<eos> I don't know!<eos> All I know is that the world is full of bad people.<eos> And we cannot trust anyone from the outside.<eos> It is you and me, Norman.
You'll see your friends, you'll have fun.<eos> It'll be restorative. Like that time we took Xanax and slept for 16 hours.<eos> Oh, God, that was good.<eos> You know, I love those girls, but I really just don't want to have a party weekend right now.<eos> I want to have a weekend with you.
How do you do it? How do you look this flawless getting off a plane?<eos> It's honestly rude.<eos> What, are you flirting with me?<eos> I would not flirt with a happily married woman who broke my heart.<eos> Oh, my God, you broke up with me, don't even start with that.
It's honestly rude.<eos> What, are you flirting with me?<eos> I would not flirt with a happily married woman who broke my heart.<eos> Oh, my God, you broke up with me, don't even start with that.<eos> Excuse me, now you are flirting with me, okay?
Oh, my God, did you hear Alice is making us go to a foam party?<eos> I know.<eos> She has a scary amount of time on her hands.<eos> Even though she's a full-time teacher, I'm still like, "Get a job."<eos> Do you have a job?
I'm so sorry.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> - God, the blood, it's going everywhere.<eos> Paper towels! Somebody get paper towels!<eos> Why don't you do something, Blair!
Guys, is he looking, like, straight at me?<eos> Yeah. He's looking at me, right?<eos> Hi, baby boy.<eos> Mummy Hubbard's here.<eos> She's gonna send you home.
Find a quilt. Find a fucking quilt.<eos> My water broke! My water broke!<eos> No, no, I just peed.<eos> - I have no control over this. - Pippa.<eos> Close, you fuck.
- What's up, dude? What are you doing? - What?<eos> I'm just making sure nothing's broken.<eos> I think he's fine.<eos> Yeah, he's really fine.<eos> - Oh, my God. You need to masturbate more.
Can I do your... Do you mind if I do your thing?<eos> Don't litter.<eos> All right.<eos> Hey, thanks a lot, man.<eos> - For you.
I didn't force you to do the drugs, Alice.<eos> And you know what, nobody's talking about how it was Blair's idea to get a stripper in the first place.<eos> Yeah, but you're never to blame, right?<eos> "Look at me, I'm Frankie. I live in a storage unit. - "I'm saving the world."<eos> You act like everybody's so stupid for not being a merciless asshole like you.
- I'm the asshole?<eos> - I mean, you're both kind of assholes.<eos> - Stay out of this.<eos> - Seriously.<eos> Maybe you're the asshole, Alice.
- Peter.<eos> He is so annoying.<eos> And I know why he doesn't like me.<eos> 'Cause he's, like, so freaking jealous.<eos> Peter is not jealous of you.
Well, then, why would you not invite your best friend to your bridal shower?<eos> - Oh, my God, you really want to know why?<eos> - Yes! I do!<eos> Because I knew that if I invited you, you wouldn't let me talk to anybody else. That's why.<eos> Okay? You monopolize my time and then you make me feel guilty about not spending time with you.
Or you're Skyping with other people.<eos> I can't do your stupid fucking accent.<eos> - No, you can't.<eos> We're not in college anymore, and things do change.<eos> The only thing that's changed is you.
Now, I'm going upstairs to wipe this shit off my face, so I can at least look cute for my mug shot.<eos> And self-waxing is not weird.<eos> I don't appreciate your body-hair-removal shaming.<eos> Shame on you!<eos> And you!
And self-waxing is not weird.<eos> I don't appreciate your body-hair-removal shaming.<eos> Shame on you!<eos> And you!<eos> You've been fine.
And it was right!<eos> We were right to kill him!<eos> Fuck, yeah!<eos> Hey, Jess. We're not going to jail.<eos> I still might be, for unrelated things, but you're not, you're safe.
What the hell's going on here?<eos> Come on. Let's go, move it. Let's go, tough guy.<eos> Everyone in America really does have a gun!<eos> Let's go!<eos> Come on. You, too.
But then we met, and the first night we went out, you didn't introduce me to people as your roommate, you introduced me as your friend.<eos> And I knew everything was gonna be okay.<eos> When I went home that summer and I showed my mom the photos of us hanging out, she was so happy.<eos> She doesn't always recognize me anymore, but when I show her those old photos, she says to me, "That's my daughter with all her friends."<eos> That's how she remembers me. Thanks to you.

Thanks to you.<eos> I can't wait to show her all the photos from this weekend.<eos> You were there for me, and I will always be here for you.
I am about to lose my fucking shit.<eos> Jay's dead, and you expect me to believe that you guys don't know anything?<eos> New plan.<eos> You're gonna watch each other die, until one of you opens your fucking mouth!<eos> - And I'm gonna start with you.
And I don't know how you're gonna get to New York. I guess hitchhike, but...<eos> I already have my bags packed, actually, so...<eos> Well, just 'cause I'm between places...<eos> Shut up.<eos> Babe. It's for you.
Do you prefer window or aisle?<eos> I'm more of a middle seat guy myself, but...<eos> You know what? I'm actually getting married. But I'll be there first thing Monday morning.<eos> You're getting married?<eos> Jess, I'm in love with you.
I've written a song that I hope can sort of encapsulate the bond of friendship that we all have.<eos> And so, I want to play it for you now.<eos> Sometimes<eos> You kill a man<eos> When he's taking off his clothes for you
I don't wanna go, Mom.<eos> I know you don't, but you have to.<eos> It's gonna be fine.<eos> But they all think I choked that girl.<eos> Yeah, but you know that you didn't and I know that you didn't.
- The one.<eos> For every person, there's the one.<eos> Case in point, you're my one.<eos> - Well, you are my...<eos> But for you, he's the one you fell irreparably in love with, who irreparably broke your heart, who you apparently can't get over 15 years later.
Men can be a little more intuitive than we give them credit for, you know?<eos> Have you thought about seeing a counselor?<eos> My God, we don't need a counselor.<eos> Couples fight.<eos> You telling me you and Perry don't ever fight?
On a less positive note, I believe I failed you miserably.<eos> I thought Harry was just a stupid stuffed animal for babies.<eos> He is.<eos> Mom?<eos> - Can we sleep with you tonight?
- Good morning, Maddie.<eos> - How are you?<eos> - Everyone's making me angry.<eos> - I'm sorry to hear that.<eos> - Except for you.
Sure.<eos> You know, as far as I can tell, there was no undue influence or interference.<eos> Like, Abby asked Bonnie some questions about Planned Parenthood, Bonnie answered them. Abby then asked Bonnie to drive her there.<eos> There was no parental usurps of any kind, I promise you that.<eos> But I can discuss that whole thing with Maddie. What I wanted to take up with you is...
Mr. Sensitive.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> No, actually, I meant that as a compliment.<eos> You're kind of like today's standard-bearer for the evolved man.<eos> Like, you work at home, you... You do almost 50-50 in the childcare. You even cook.
- That's not what I meant at all, man.<eos> - Okay. I thought it'd be indelicate to bring it up with Maddie. That's why I'm bringing it up with you.<eos> Well, that sounded like a threat, Nathan.<eos> Are you threatening me?<eos> No, but, actually, I feel like you're starting to threaten me, which I don't think you want to go there.
We left it... he's got Bonnie's back and I've got yours.<eos> My He-Man.<eos> Come on.<eos> Can I just say one thing?<eos> You never leave it at one thing.
Makes me so mad.<eos> I bet they call themselves Christians, too.<eos> Grandpa says you might find a job if you were more Christian.<eos> Ah, your grandpa's full of crap.<eos> Grandpa says you're the one full of crap.
I still can't understand why those children can't say one little prayer.<eos> They can pray all they want to.<eos> - School can't force 'em to.<eos> - Okay, Maddy. But can't somebody else fight this?<eos> Why does it always have to be you?
They're ignoring me.<eos> They won't call on me anymore.<eos> I don't know, Billy Boy.<eos> Maybe we oughta drop this.<eos> I don't wanna have to worry about you.
A little overcooked, just like you like them.<eos> You remembered.<eos> I figured the least we could do if we're all stuck here together is be civil.<eos> I wouldn't spit in your ass if your guts were on fire.<eos> - That civil enough for you?
I am willing to bet that after we get our money... you won't be calling the police.<eos> You wouldn't want to expose those hidden accounts of yours.<eos> In the meantime, why don't you take these next few days here as your own dark night of the soul?<eos> Time for a little self-reflection.<eos> If anyone's in need of self-reflection, David, that'd be you.
I have a wife and a child now.<eos> I'm not sure this is the life that I want for them.<eos> - Right, that's your decision.<eos> - All right.<eos> I just don't know if I can keep up what I'm doing without you.
You couldn't have been more than ten.<eos> And that day you said to me,<eos> "If something makes you really mad, you've gotta go out there and do something about it."<eos> All my life... I just wanted one person somewhere, sometime, to understand me.<eos> And that person turned out to be you.
And taking on God and the church is... well, kind of the ultimate, isn't it?<eos> So, as long as there's a fight to be had, I'll still be a squeaky wheel.<eos> Well, there you have it, people.<eos> Now let's get something started!<eos> You watch and learn, Red, and one of these days you'll be running this whole goddamn place.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?<eos> I wanna live my own life! Okay?<eos> I'm sick and tired of living your life!<eos> What, you're gonna leave me? Like all the rest of 'em?<eos> After everything I've fucking done for you?
This is just like the old days.<eos> You used to let me win.<eos> You were the boss. I had to.<eos> Does that mean I'm supposed to let you win now?<eos> You do have the gun.
Thank you for telling me the fucking truth.<eos> Yeah, you live long enough and you lose faith in people.<eos> Not that I ever had much faith in anyone.<eos> But... you have impressed me, David.<eos> Starting to wish Bill Jr. Could've turned out more like you.
He betrayed me.<eos> That's what men do. Betray me.<eos> But, no, David, he didn't hurt me.<eos> Nobody can really hurt me.<eos> Now that I trust you, I wanna show you something.
See anybody laughing?<eos> No more for him, huh?<eos> Madalyn, sorry.<eos> I don't wanna hear your excuses.<eos> Right now, all I want out of you is breathing.
My Billy Boy... he used to mix a mean Manhattan.<eos> Here's to new friends.<eos> You're all right, Danny Fry.<eos> You know, I'm real sorry we're putting you through all this.<eos> It's not you. It's David.
Here's to new friends.<eos> You're all right, Danny Fry.<eos> You know, I'm real sorry we're putting you through all this.<eos> It's not you. It's David.<eos> I'd watch your ass around him if I were you.
Yeah.<eos> Well, you've called me worse.<eos> I suppose.<eos> It doesn't mean anything, you know that.<eos> What about you, Red?
I was wondering if I could interview you about these auditions.<eos> For the school paper?<eos> It's time for North Salem to have a GSA.<eos> My old school had one, and most schools in Oregon do, so don't think I'm asking for some kind of fringe thing or whatever.<eos> Well, look, I-I'm proud of you... uh, that you have spoken your mind.

- But first, travel is...<eos> Yes?<eos> I don't get this.<eos> Who are you?<eos> And who are you?
Can you please not shout?<eos> Look, I saw your boardroom performance.<eos> - You are a terrible public speaker.<eos> - It wasn't a performance.<eos> This is the perfect way for you to get your... whatever you call it, your lesbians-in-love club.
- A job well done, all those competitors who have advanced.<eos> Please proceed to your next round.<eos> For those who did not advance, the cafeteria is available for a short time and accepts all major credit cards.<eos> Finally, congratulations to the Holy Ghost Academy...<eos> Hey, is that you, man?
Your friend looks pretty miserable over there.<eos> It's been a long day.<eos> Any suggestions?<eos> They tell me not to write about the mayor, I don't.<eos> I don't write about you and Healy, either.
Who told you about me and Healy?<eos> I should still write an article on it.<eos> I might.<eos> It's news, real news.<eos> He shouldn't be allowed to teach at our school, and you...
You don't know anything about what happened.<eos> I can guess, but I know it's pretty gross, and illegal.<eos> First of all, I'm 18, which means I'm an adult, so I can talk to whoever I want, okay?<eos> You look like you could use a drink.<eos> You look like you could use a shower.
Too soon.<eos> You know you're really lucky, right?<eos> I know.<eos> Especially since that guy, Mark... day after we did it, I... called just to say hey or whatever, and he was like,<eos> "I never would have slept with you if I wasn't so wasted," so...
Especially since that guy, Mark... day after we did it, I... called just to say hey or whatever, and he was like,<eos> "I never would have slept with you if I wasn't so wasted," so...<eos> So you guys are... getting married?<eos> Yep. It's a spring wedding.<eos> I have a surprise for you.

We're still using them.<eos> I want you to help me find a Hellhound.<eos> You were tracking him.<eos> You lost his scent.<eos> I found him on you.
You have to find Scott.<eos> I'm not leaving you.<eos> You have to.<eos> You can save me on the other side.<eos> I believe in you.
We didn't need to talk.<eos> But, when you finally closed your eyes,<eos> I was myself again.<eos> I knew you were gone.<eos> Liam, you and Lydia get to the bunker.
What's happening?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But stay behind me.<eos> Follow me.<eos> It's afraid of you.
You are a good guy.<eos> ♪ I promise ♪<eos> But if you go after Margot, she'll go after you, and I promise you I will break myself out of here if I have to to keep that from happening.<eos> Could you really do that?<eos> But I'm not gonna do that, because you and Margot... are going to leave each other alone, right?
But if Margot comes after me...<eos> Trust me.<eos> Margot just became the head of one of the most powerful crime families in the world.<eos> ♪ Trust me, girl ♪<eos> She's got bigger problems than you right now.
Look, I know you don't like him...<eos> No, I hated him.<eos> But he stepped up.<eos> He turned himself in.<eos> He went to jail for you.
He did not call. You know why?<eos> Because someone with a shiv found out that he made a deal with the feds.<eos> The United States government is gonna pay you to be a criminal?<eos> I know it sounds good, but...<eos> - What, just you?
The missing payments?<eos> [Chuckles]<eos> Darling, I can hardly get a proper cup of tea in here, let alone coordinate a mutiny from the inside.<eos> I think you'd rather destroy the Firm than let me have it.<eos> Margot [Sighs] your father and I built up the business for you and for Rhys.
Your father only told me because he knew he was dying.<eos> Well, if you didn't do this, then who did?<eos> Who else would Dad have told?<eos> Well, you find out, because I can't do anything from in here.<eos> It's up to you now, darling.
Well, if you didn't do this, then who did?<eos> Who else would Dad have told?<eos> Well, you find out, because I can't do anything from in here.<eos> It's up to you now, darling.<eos> It's all up to you.
- No, that is not it at all.<eos> It's fine, it's fine.<eos> Yeah, I just...<eos> I thought I was gonna be different this time.<eos> You know, I was coming to you with money.
You were gonna marry him.<eos> No, he was gonna marry me whether I wanted to or not.<eos> Do you ever... ever hear from him?<eos> No, he knows better than that.<eos> Do you?
Not even a plant.<eos> It's just me.<eos> Is that sad? I'm not sad?<eos> No, no, it's good.<eos> I just thought you and... and Danny were...
Or perhaps if someone would stop standing there like a bloody waxwork.<eos> He really is magnificent, isn't he?<eos> Oh, you have no idea.<eos> No, I do.<eos> [Trunk closes] Anyway, the Firm belongs to you now.
Wait. What?<eos> ...and our computers, thanks to Dao.<eos> - Thank God. - Hmm?<eos> We can get back to work.<eos> But it's up to you.
Every sight of you is a wonder<eos> You float on the edge of a sword<eos> You are life, Julia You are the beloved, Julia<eos> Pale-skinned, Julia A leopards tread, Julia<eos> Without you, life's not Worth a cent, Julia
- Come, I'll get you fed.<eos> When you went missing, I realised that I don't love you.<eos> Had you told me earlier, I wouldn't have come back.<eos> Love is too small a word.<eos> Without you, I have no reason to live.
How's grandpa?<eos> He must be fine.<eos> - What about the stroke?<eos> It was a lie.<eos> To keep me away from you.
OK, do whatever you want.<eos> I'll really jump.<eos> - At least take this opium.<eos> Oh, another lie?<eos> I got this for you, 'Akbari Afeem'.
Excuse me, that's Major General Harding to you.<eos> And what are you smiling at, you moron?<eos> If you had any sense, you wouldn't have shot him and we could've caught the mole.<eos> 11 pm tomorrow, at Singhat.<eos> He faithfully worked for you for 15 years.
Shit!<eos> I'm out Sir!<eos> They're running out of ammunition.<eos> Take the sword and cross the bridge.<eos> And you?
They're running out of ammunition.<eos> Take the sword and cross the bridge.<eos> And you?<eos> I'll hold them off, leave now.<eos> Not without you.
- No!<eos> Kiddo, come back.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Can you really give me what I want?<eos> Anything for you.
Anything for you.<eos> Will you take this to where it belongs,<eos> on the other side?<eos> Come on, now.<eos> I can't live without you.
We go up to Uncle Ralph's for Christmas Eve...<eos> - Christmas Eve.<eos> And opened all the presents.<eos> We do what we always do.<eos> You and dad left early, and Rob and I stayed.
Have the source take a look at both those jack-asses.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Hey, Bob!<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I'm gonna need you and Ranger in about 3 minutes.
LT.<eos> What's going on?<eos> This ain't the plan.<eos> What are you doin', man?<eos> You and TJ skimmed 200 grand off the last job.
They're on the ramp, TJ. Two bikes.<eos> Dispatch, this is EAGLE-6.<eos> We have four suspects on two black motorcycles heading eastbound toward Pennsylvania Ave.<eos> Shots fired, shots fired!<eos> Let's see how much your boyfriend loves you.
You choose, thief.<eos> Thief?<eos> Fuck does that mean?<eos> I let you on my crew, and you're gonna steal from me?<eos> It's you or David.
What's up?<eos> I'm Jon.<eos> Jon Baker.<eos> Francis, uh, Poncherello.<eos> - Oh, you're Poncherello?
But your reaction was really strong.<eos> Borderline violent.<eos> I bet if I were a hot woman in a bikini, you'd probably be fine hugging me, yeah?<eos> Your question is, "Would I prefer to hug a hot woman in a bikini "over a male stranger in his underpants?"<eos> And my answer to that will determine whether or not I'm a homophobe, like, according to you?
I'm an officer.<eos> That's my partner, Francis Poncherello.<eos> - What's up, bro?<eos> - Dude, that is awesome!<eos> You know, my cousin competed against you in freestyle.
Yeah, me too.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Well, hey, look, man, welcome.<eos> I cannot wait to work with you.
Do you ride?<eos> - Fuck yeah!<eos> Oh, we're gonna ride!<eos> Awesome.<eos> You too, Poncharrow.
Hey.<eos> Oh, hey!<eos> How are you?<eos> - Good.<eos> How are you?
Is it a chronic thing, or did you eat something dicey last night?<eos> Just drop it!<eos> Listen, okay...<eos> Don't pull away.<eos> I'm worried about you.
We all have sex issues.<eos> I haven't slept with my wife in a year.<eos> But when people have oversexualized behavior like yours, sometimes that's evidence of past childhood trauma and I just wanted you to feel safe talking to me.<eos> There's been no trauma, okay?<eos> And my goal in life isn't to feel safe talking to you.
Not like that.<eos> Unless they were part of your crew.<eos> I can't imagine anyone trusting you with their life. Oh...<eos> Wait, your partner.<eos> He did just before he got gunned down in front of you.
I can't imagine anyone trusting you with their life. Oh...<eos> Wait, your partner.<eos> He did just before he got gunned down in front of you.<eos> Oh, so, you know something about me.<eos> I know something about you.
We'll be surfing, drinking Mai Tais.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I'm gonna do it.<eos> Yeah, there's no point in me doing this without you, you know?
- Are you serious?<eos> - Yes, I'm serious.<eos> Okay, don't shoot.<eos> I do all the shooting, okay?<eos> Okay, I'll corral them to you.
- Can you manage?<eos> - Got it.<eos> Last one.<eos> So, what's the plan now, babe?<eos> The second Brian gets out of the hospital, you, Cooper, and Hansen, you head up to Big Bear.
There he is.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Where's your breathing tube?<eos> That was a really sexy look for you.
Not quite! Um...<eos> That's a little gross because you kind of remind me of my dad.<eos> Wait, your dad was a cop?<eos> God, no.<eos> He was just a fuck-up, kind of like you.
- You know the oath?<eos> When we get to the hospital, we do all the questioning, okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> "Come now, just you and your partner."
Listen, I've done back flips with worse injuries than this.<eos> We're gonna need backup.<eos> Clearly, he blames us for Reed.<eos> We don't know who in this department is in on this.<eos> - I trust you, and you trust me.
They're coming at us!<eos> Go, go, go!<eos> Go, go, go!<eos> Ah! Jon!<eos> Get up, you fucking rat!
No. Your beef's with the steel cable, not us.<eos> We were just chasing him.<eos> You weren't as good as Reed.<eos> My son should be here with me right now.<eos> Not you.
Back up, you're on Ponch's pinky!<eos> I saw a look on your face tonight I haven't seen in years, not since you competed.<eos> I can tell you really like this thing, being a cop.<eos> Yeah, I really do, maybe even more than riding.<eos> Do you want me to ride in the ambulance with you?
You want some morphine?<eos> That'd be nice.<eos> Um, excuse me, Ava?<eos> Uh, yes, Jon?<eos> I'm really sorry I didn't take that ride home with you from the hospital.
I went over.<eos> Told his mother.<eos> Jimmy was her last boy left.<eos> - Whoever did this...<eos> - No, it's you, Doug.
Told his mother.<eos> Jimmy was her last boy left.<eos> - Whoever did this...<eos> - No, it's you, Doug.<eos> You did this.
Was this justice for Jimmy?<eos> I don't know these people.<eos> Well, they're bloody animals.<eos> Who do you know?<eos> It's too dangerous for you, too, isn't it?
There's nothing I can do.<eos> These people will turn on anyone they start to doubt.<eos> Yeah, well, don't you worry about me.<eos> - Like I said...<eos> - I'm not worried about you.
And take great pleasure in it, I'm sure.<eos> Don't stay here, Sylvia.<eos> Leave the controlled zone... go to the Lakes.<eos> You sound like Harry.<eos> He's worried about you.
Does it matter?<eos> Yes, it does.<eos> The guy I knew and trusted at the embassy just moved back home, so I was going to have to play it by ear.<eos> Ha! You have an answer for everything, don't you?<eos> It only seems that way because you never stop asking me questions.
Don't answer the door to anyone.<eos> What is it you want?<eos> Hmm? No Resistance?<eos> No hope? Huh?<eos> What I want is PC Dunn as well as you working on this case.
I wonder what he's got planned for me.<eos> Well, maybe you shouldn't go.<eos> An antique dealer might know something about the Shepherd Market murder.<eos> Or maybe he thinks you're in with the Germans, just like he is.<eos> I'm worried about you, Doug.
So i've always had this sense that-- That, you know, the day would come where she would just-- Where she would just not love me anymore, and--<eos> And i... I think i'm constantly looking for evidence that she--<eos> Evidence that she doesn't-- doesn't love you anymore.<eos> Celeste, how do you feel about what perry just said?<eos> I gave up my career for you.
Ed. Nathan.<eos> Um, can i steal you for a second?<eos> Um, it's about this whole abby thing.<eos> That was not my doing.<eos> I'm as surprised as you are.
You wanted to propose that?<eos> Yeah, you know, to discuss the transitional parenting paradigm of Abigail.<eos> Make sure there aren't any glaring "ch-asms," like... you know, like this whole tutor thing.<eos> "To discuss the transitional parenting paradigms to make sure we don't have any glaring chasms?"<eos> Who talks like that, Nathan? Why don't you just say this is Bonnie's idea?
I said, "Fucking mosquitos bite the shit out of me."<eos> Doesn't matter as long as our skin doesn't come in touch with DEET.<eos> What is your point, Nathan?<eos> My point is I did a lot of fucked-up things in our marriage, a lot of hoops I jumped through for you, and now I'm doing those same things for Bonnie.<eos> Personally, I'd rather shove an electric eel up my ass and have it gnaw through my intestines than sit down with you and fucking Psycho Ed.
He would've never done that when we were together.<eos> Never!<eos> But for Bonnie, he's Mr. Fucking Sacrifice.<eos> Why don't you bottle up some of that anger - and put it to good use? - What do you mean?<eos> I think I could use you and Joseph at the meeting with the mayor tomorrow.
- Am I dreaming right now?<eos> - Yeah!<eos> Ziggy.<eos> You were sleepwalking, baby.<eos> What happened between you and my dad?
I'm not trying to get pregnant.<eos> I'm just trying to help out a friend. What's the big problem?<eos> Why is it such a big deal for you?<eos> It's not.<eos> I'm just looking out for you, Sparkles.
I'm just trying to help out a friend. What's the big problem?<eos> Why is it such a big deal for you?<eos> It's not.<eos> I'm just looking out for you, Sparkles.<eos> If you go to pieces again, who's gonna put you back together?
It's not.<eos> I'm just looking out for you, Sparkles.<eos> If you go to pieces again, who's gonna put you back together?<eos> Madeline?<eos> I'm the one who's always there for you. Always will be.
You know, we all have baggage, Ed.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Nothing.<eos> It doesn't help, by the way, that you're this seemingly perfect step-mom.<eos> Anyway, we're gonna do this dinner, but I think it'll be up to you and me to keep things civil.
We're friends.<eos> That's great!<eos> What do you and Ziggy like to do together?<eos> We just like playing and stuff.<eos> And he's nice to you?
Stick that up your tight ass, bitch!<eos> You were fucking brilliant!<eos> - Really? - Um, yeah.<eos> It's actually kind of annoying that you look like that and you're smart and educated and intelligent and sympathetic.<eos> You even had Cruella agreeing with you in the end.
That is a done deal.<eos> It's amazing.<eos> You have nothing to worry about.<eos> You're so good to me.<eos> I believe in you.
Or was it my hand in his shirt?<eos> It was a reflex!<eos> So you're saying the thing's mutual.<eos> No, he jumped me and then he yelled at me. I'm in love with you.<eos> You hear me? I'm in love with you, Madeline.
I love you.<eos> There's nothing like the sound of crunching cereal in the morning.<eos> Not too summery?<eos> No, it looks incredible.<eos> It's funny how clothes always seem to do that on you.
I mean, why are you on Abby's Facebook page?<eos> How did she friend you?<eos> I'm not her friend, I'm her mother.<eos> And it's my job to be on it and it's yours, too, particularly when she's living with you.<eos> You assume the obligation to parent, which is what I guess you've been pretty...
This is not compatible.<eos> But, you know, fuck convention.<eos> Like, let's do this. Let's throw it all away.<eos> I know you have feelings for me.<eos> Well, then if you know that, just cling to that.
- Oh, hi. - Hi, Tori.<eos> - How are you?<eos> - Better.<eos> I think we're all doing better.<eos> How are you feeling?
I can't...<eos> Um, you're meant to be our doctor. You're treating us.<eos> And you are demonizing him.<eos> Does he know you're here alone?<eos> I was just thinking about you.
Ninth grade. - English Lit. - Okay.<eos> So, what's your point?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I relate to the guy.<eos> I mean, I can't imagine not looking back at you.
Let's go. Come on, come on.<eos> Come on, Holt! Supposed to be on the road an hour ago.<eos> Just give us a second, Dad.<eos> You're doing the right thing.<eos> Your mom, she really needs you right now.
That asshole hung up on me!<eos> I wonder why. Okay.<eos> We'll switch tails. You talk to Holt? No!<eos> He isn't answering his phone. - Come on.<eos> - Holt has his own problems. You have to help me, Gabriel.
Get to your studio. Don't talk to anyone along the way.<eos> Make a copy of the video and wait. I'm gonna send someone right now. Hey, hey, hey!<eos> Everything's gonna be fine, darling. You understand?<eos> I understand!<eos> But you don't.
Because I'm terrible at saying no.<eos> Because you deserve a little something.<eos> Is that what you're gonna wear?<eos> You just gonna stay over there?<eos> Carla said that I had to stay as far away from you as possible.
You just gonna stay over there?<eos> Carla said that I had to stay as far away from you as possible.<eos> Cool.<eos> You're standing really still.<eos> Maybe you should come in.
Oh, shit.<eos> I'm sorry, Maddy.<eos> No, no, no. You should enjoy that.<eos> For us both.<eos> It's boring without you.
Ellipsis.<eos> You make me wanna stay in Los Angeles.<eos> Why would you go?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm moving closer to you.
Olly isn't a stranger.<eos> He's not yours.<eos> What?<eos> He's not yours.<eos> And maybe he's interested in you now, but he's out there.
You're not mine.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> There's gonna be another girl, you'll be her Olly.<eos> There is no other girl.<eos> It's not safe. I don't really think when I'm around you.
What are you really losing?<eos> Dear Mom, The first thing is that I love you.<eos> You already know that, but I may not get the chance to tell you again.<eos> You are smart and strong and kind and selfless.<eos> Because of you, I've survived this long and gotten to know my small part of the world.
Well, have you asked her?<eos> She doesn't talk about it anymore, but she used to say that, "You'd understand when you get older "and when you have your own relationships."<eos> She says love makes people crazy.<eos> Do you believe that?<eos> Do you?
She doesn't talk about it anymore, but she used to say that, "You'd understand when you get older "and when you have your own relationships."<eos> She says love makes people crazy.<eos> Do you believe that?<eos> Do you?<eos> Well, I mean, I'm here in Hawaii with you, so...
Better for who?<eos> Ellipses.<eos> Don't do this, Maddy.<eos> Ellipses.<eos> Look, my life is better with you in it.
Actually, I've been thinking maybe you don't need a nurse.<eos> You learned a tough lesson, and I can't imagine you repeating it.<eos> Good.<eos> I wish you'd talk to me.<eos> I'll never meet anyone like you, Maddy.
This is my last e-mail.<eos> We're moving back to New York.<eos> We're leaving tonight, when my dad's out drinking.<eos> My mom wants to do it at night, because she's afraid she won't be able to do it if he's right in front of her.<eos> I finally told her about you.
What are you talking about?<eos> You have records for everything. But you have nothing about SCID!<eos> Where are the papers?<eos> Well, they must be here, because I keep... I keep everything and I...<eos> Did you take them?
Daughter of the South.<eos> Stone queen on a throne of honey.<eos> Secret owner of all gold.<eos> I am yours, my beloved Bilquis.<eos> Queens and concubines and maidens hide their faces in shame before you because you are the mother of all beauty.
I am yours, my beloved Bilquis.<eos> Queens and concubines and maidens hide their faces in shame before you because you are the mother of all beauty.<eos> Trees bow, and warriors fall.<eos> Give me your blessing.<eos> I bow my head before you and worship you.
We'll negotiate the terms of your employment over a drink.<eos> Every fucking time.<eos> Coin tricks, is it?<eos> You're working for our man, then.<eos> Who are you?
It's easier just to pluck them out of the air.<eos> Simplest trick in the world.<eos> How'd you do it?<eos> Tell you what.<eos> I'll fight you for it.
How'd you do it?<eos> Tell you what.<eos> I'll fight you for it.<eos> Come on.<eos> I'm not fighting you.
Come on.<eos> I'm not fighting you.<eos> Real gold, if you're wondering.<eos> Win or lose, and you're gonna lose.<eos> It's yours if you fight me.
I'm not fighting you.<eos> Real gold, if you're wondering.<eos> Win or lose, and you're gonna lose.<eos> It's yours if you fight me.<eos> He said he doesn't want to fight you.
Win or lose, and you're gonna lose.<eos> It's yours if you fight me.<eos> He said he doesn't want to fight you.<eos> Come on.<eos> Big fella like you.
That's... that's a "We're in this together" thing.<eos> W-Was it love?<eos> Because if you were going to leave, you could have just told me, okay?<eos> I could've taken it.<eos> You know, I had a surprise for you.
And I know that why?<eos> Because four of them were about math.<eos> I like math.<eos> Who knew?<eos> I just wanted to come back better than when I went in... for you.
Telling you I don't know.<eos> Would you tell me even if you did?<eos> Probably not.<eos> As you say, I work for Mr. Wednesday.<eos> Well, then why the fuck am I wasting my time sitting here talking to you?
Not in a long while has he been one of yours.<eos> You separate a head from a body, that is strike fucking one across the bow.<eos> They all ain't going to take that lightly. Good.<eos> Wait 'til he sees strike two, when I get myself that queen.<eos> What about you?
For every belief, every branch, every denomination they see a different face when they close their eyes to pray.<eos> So who are you?<eos> Like I said, you wouldn't believe in me if I told you.<eos> Happy Easter, you old fraud.<eos> And a fair Ostara to you.
Serious question, my dear.<eos> I have no doubt that millions upon millions exchange tokens and observe the rituals of your festival, all down to the hunting of the hidden eggs, but does anybody pray in your name?<eos> Do they say it in worship?<eos> They mouth your name, but they have no idea what it means. None whatsoever.<eos> Same every spring. You do all the work, he gets all the prayers.
They killed my friend.<eos> He pledged his allegiance to me, and forged a blade in my honor.<eos> And they killed him for it.<eos> The new gods.<eos> That's why we need you.
Worst thing you can do to someone is call them.<eos> I've been occupied.<eos> Yes, you have.<eos> Impressive reach metrics. Deep penetration.<eos> Total unique impressions is what sells and no one leaves an impression more unique than you.
Impressive reach metrics. Deep penetration.<eos> Total unique impressions is what sells and no one leaves an impression more unique than you.<eos> You've done well with me.<eos> Very well.<eos> Now... It's my turn to do well by you.
Total unique impressions is what sells and no one leaves an impression more unique than you.<eos> You've done well with me.<eos> Very well.<eos> Now... It's my turn to do well by you.<eos> I can take care of you.
I mean, they just pluck their food out of the freezer, throw it in the microwave, watch it spin around.<eos> Never once have they had to work for it, give thanks for it, or pray to you for it.<eos> Make them pray.<eos> Let them remind themselves it was a queen that gave them the harvest.<eos> They'll be hungry but then they'll turn to you, and they will pray to Ostara once again.
As if the difference between one side of that divide and the other could be quantified.<eos> Some believe that you can develop a last image seen off their retinas. Like a photograph.<eos> Death is usually the last enemy.<eos> Right but not for... not for Jesus Christ.<eos> Not for you.
Are you still working for the man?<eos> I was.<eos> About that, we have a problem here.<eos> A problem with me?<eos> Not with you, you.
We had a date?<eos> Standing. Our Marshmallow Peep show.<eos> Candy cream eggs, cellophane grass, bunnies and duckies, we popularized the pagan.<eos> We practically invented brunch.<eos> We built this holiday. You and me.
That's right, I killed you!<eos> I killed you fucking dead!<eos> No!<eos> You are not a god!<eos> She said that I was killed by a god. You are a lot of things, but you are not a god.
St. Nick took the same deal you did.<eos> The only reason why you're relevant today is because Easter is a Christian holiday.<eos> It's religious Darwinism.<eos> Adapt and survive.<eos> What we have achieved together, you and I, is no small feat. Now that we're living in an atheist world.

The thing I've been asking myself is what kind of sick individual names a street Edgewood Way and he put it half a mile away from Edgewood Lane?<eos> It's crazy.<eos> You got me out here in this creepy, confusing ass suburb.
I'm not jealous of Rod.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Yeah, that scared the shit outta me.<eos> You?
Dad, this is why I don't bring people to the house anymore.<eos> That's okay.<eos> We're not judging. We're not.<eos> That's a nasty habit, though.<eos> You should have Missy take care of that for you.
There was time.<eos> There was time, if somebody was looking for her.<eos> There was time, but nobody, nobody was looking.<eos> You're all I got.<eos> I'm not gonna leave here without you.
Matter of fact, I went to the police.<eos> What did you say?<eos> I just said he was missing.<eos> Oh, good.<eos> Let me ask you somethin'.
The transplantation.<eos> Well, partial, actually.<eos> The piece of your brain connected to your nervous system needs to stay put, keeping those intricate connections intact.<eos> So you won't be gone, not completely.<eos> A sliver of you will still be in there, somewhere, limited consciousness.
Me.<eos> You'll be me.<eos> Good, good.<eos> You got it quick.<eos> Good on you.
And he ain't even yesterday anymore.<eos> I heard about the trouble you had with the Technical Boy.<eos> I was impressed with how you dealt with him.<eos> Efficient, no-nonsense, effective.<eos> Who'd have thought you had it in you?
- Well, hello.<eos> Cards on the table, you know we added Jordan Wilder to the "Ed" list, right?<eos> Yep.<eos> You hardly have any scenes together.<eos> It's mostly you, alone on a magical island with August.
Wait...<eos> You said that yesterday.<eos> 'Look, Lexie...' 'maybe you don't want to talk to him.'<eos> What is that supposed to mean?<eos> 'He may be your agent' 'but I still believe in you.'
Maybe he won't get it.<eos> We both know if Jordan wants it, he'll get it.<eos> Rainer, can you guys please just get over this?<eos> I feel like I'm reliving my parents' divorce.<eos> You didn't hear it from me but it's down to you and Dakota for August.
He is the best guy friend I've ever had and I'm not gonna screw that up.<eos> You're already screwing' it up.<eos> By not screwing him, because you know it's gonna happen.<eos> You're gonna wait too long, he'll meet someone else and how are you gonna feel then?<eos> Look, you're into him and I'm pretty sure he's into you too.
If they make me an offer, I'm taking it.<eos> Do you really think that's a good idea?<eos> You guys can't even be in the same room together.<eos> I'll deal with it.<eos> I know why he's so mad at you.
- It is?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - You're-you're not mad at me?<eos> - Are you serious?<eos> Would you be mad if it was me and not you?
That's not stealing. It's called a party favor.<eos> - Holy crap.<eos> - Huh.<eos> Paige, do you think that Rainer's gonna be there?<eos> 'Big day for you.'
'Big day for you.'<eos> Get any sleep?<eos> Um, a little.<eos> After Cassie finally stopped talking.<eos> She's excited for you.
We can't forget the past, Noah.<eos> 'Cause that's saying it never happened, and that's a lie.<eos> I came back.<eos> Isn't that enough?<eos> I can't be with you unless you can forgive me.
Whenever you're ready, Jordan.<eos> I'm sorry in advance if I'm a little nervous.<eos> Let's go.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> August, there's nothing out there for you.
Because I've been there.<eos> You lied to me.<eos> 'You don't have to do this.'<eos> 'Yes, I do.'<eos> 'Oh, when I'm gone, I'll spend every moment I can' 'remembering you.'
To talk about the movie?<eos> No. I just thought we could hang.<eos> We?<eos> Like..<eos> ...you, me, us, we?
- Jake got an agent.<eos> I got an assistant's card.<eos> What?<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Okay, enough about you.
Where are you?<eos> 'I'll send a car.'<eos> Uh... that's so sweet of you actually but, you know, my friends just put on their very first play and, um, I'm gonna be celebrating with them tonight.<eos> So let's make it a party.<eos> I mean, I'm not going without you.
How would I do that?<eos> Say that you were wrong.<eos> Take it all back.<eos> I can't take it back, Will, because it's the truth.<eos> Who knows better than you?
"Faith."<eos> Oh, God.<eos> I have such contempt for that word.<eos> Show me someone who relies on faith and I'll show you someone who's given up control over whatever it is they believe.<eos> Sorry, there's nothing more I can do for you.
- Sit down.<eos> I need you to come with me right now.<eos> Sit down, Will.<eos> This is just your memory.<eos> I'm a part of you.
Two separate parts in the same place.<eos> Okay, Dad, defibrillator's charged.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> I'm not ready to go back yet.<eos> I need more time with you.
His heart's stopped, Thomas.<eos> Organs are shutting down.<eos> They're trying to bring you back.<eos> That's okay.<eos> If I die, I'll just come back here to you.
If I die, I'll just come back here to you.<eos> No, not this time.<eos> You don't have to come back anymore.<eos> You helped me get to where I needed to be and now you'll go someplace else.<eos> When I get there, will I be able to remember you?
His brain's showing barely any activity.<eos> You're leaving now.<eos> This is it.<eos> I'm not leaving this room until we revive my son.<eos> When I get there... I'm going to remember you.
Because some girls think, you know,<eos> "I'm gonna work for a year or two and make some money and put it aside and then I'll do something else."<eos> And I'm like, "Yeah, you're not doing something else."<eos> You're gonna have at any other job, someone's gonna know what you've done."<eos> You have to be done with the business before the business is done with you.
I had been cast on a film, and there was somebody else doing a scene before me, very famous, very well known actress in the business, good friend of mine.<eos> And she was sitting on the sofa, and there was her costar on the other end of the sofa.<eos> This is before filming.<eos> I used to get in trouble on every single set.<eos> Once my makeup was done, I'm on you.
These two people sat on opposite ends of the sofa on their phones.<eos> And then they called, you know, "We're ready for you on set," and they just went and fucked.<eos> There was no connection, no nothing.<eos> Sex is such an intimate thing, for me, that I have to like you to fuck you.<eos> I have to want to be with you.
And so, I don't.<eos> I mean, I've done adult for a long, long time.<eos> I mean, there's other things that can be done that I'm also interested in that I would like to do since the adult business doesn't exist anymore.<eos> Since... Let it go to bed.<eos> - It's for you.
Having my daughter pulled out of my life in such a... harsh manner.<eos> You know, there was no phone calls.<eos> There was... I couldn't tell her I love her.<eos> You know, "I'm sorry, I don't know what's happening."<eos> I'm trying to get to you."
Nothing.<eos> I'm just...<eos> Looking for something?<eos> What would I be looking for?<eos> You tell me.
So you can chat 'em up.<eos> Oh, chat's not really my thing.<eos> I like it.<eos> I think we're gonna get along.<eos> As long as you remember I started here three weeks before you, so I have seniority, which is why I'm training you.
It plays tapes, right?<eos> It does, last I checked.<eos> How were things at school today?<eos> Same. Everyone's still acting weird.<eos> And you?
I win!<eos> You owe me five dollars.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> - You bet on me?<eos> - Against you.
Oh, please.<eos> I've known you this entire century.<eos> Well, give me a break.<eos> I'm not good with the... you know, and the gay rumors only recently subsided.<eos> Mmm. So the stakes are high for you.
Only if it comes up.<eos> Kat!<eos> - Shit! - Watch it!<eos> Meet the boys.<eos> Justin Foley is mine, and Zach Dempsey for you.
Speaking of, gotta go.<eos> Oh, yeah, great. Um...<eos> I'll see you later?<eos> You will!<eos> I even decided to like basketball for you, Justin.
Hannah.<eos> A rumor based on a kiss ruined a memory that I hoped would be special.<eos> In fact, it ruined just about everything... as you'll soon see.<eos> And stick around, Justin.<eos> I'm not through with you yet.
Welcome back.<eos> So glad you're still listening.<eos> Are you having fun?<eos> You must be wondering who's next, and why.<eos> Is it you?
I've been there.<eos> Now, it won't always be easy.<eos> It might even hurt a bit.<eos> Or a bit more than a bit.<eos> That depends on you.
Or a bit more than a bit.<eos> That depends on you.<eos> But fear not, we'll get through this.<eos> Step by step, tape by tape.<eos> You and me.
As is the silence.<eos> See, I can guarantee... that one of the reasons you're still listening is that you really want to know... who are the others?<eos> Who else is responsible for my death?<eos> Well, you're going to learn soon enough.<eos> And, of course, they're going to learn about you, too.
Clay. Clay, are you sure you're okay?<eos> I'm trying to be.<eos> You know, I miss her, too.<eos> A lot.<eos> You and Hannah were friends.
Hey, Joanne.<eos> Hazel.<eos> Hey.<eos> Are you following me?<eos> Um, I'm ahead of you.
I was thinking 12.<eos> And they're all, like, obese and purr... Really loud.<eos> - Where you going, anyway?<eos> - Home. I live on Bristol.<eos> You?
He's a logistics expert, mostly.<eos> Look over there.<eos> He's checking you out.<eos> - He's checking you out.<eos> - No, you, and he's cute.
Hey, man.<eos> Hey, Clay.<eos> How are you doing?<eos> How am I doing?<eos> How are you doing?
I'm committed to this.<eos> God, you're weird.<eos> No, I'm a searcher.<eos> The fact that you just called yourself a searcher is weird.<eos> Something's up with you today.
You gonna talk to her?<eos> And say what?<eos> Tell her to get her shit together.<eos> She's acting like a nut job, drawing attention to herself.<eos> And you.
That if a butterfly flaps its wings at just the right time in just the right place... it can cause a hurricane thousands of miles away.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Is Justin here?<eos> Haven't seen him for days.<eos> I thought he was with you.
Oh, shit!<eos> - What's with the fucking water?<eos> - Just having some fun.<eos> "I'm just having some fun."<eos> Justy, you know you're welcome here all the damn time, buddy, but I thought you were going home last night.
What is there to talk about?<eos> - Is Hannah telling the truth?<eos> - What do you think?<eos> Did you do what she said you did?<eos> Did you?
Mrs. Antilly?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Everything okay?<eos> What, like in the world?<eos> Or with you.
Not like a full eclipse.<eos> You wouldn't exactly see the...<eos> But, yeah.<eos> You should, like, patent yourself.<eos> And, yes, I will look at the moon with you.
Morning, Astronomy Boy.<eos> Better than Helmet, I guess.<eos> I feel they work together.<eos> Alex, maybe you think I'm being silly, like I get my titties in a twist over the tiniest things... but you didn't walk that hall.<eos> You didn't feel those eyes on you.
Okay.<eos> Now you take that medicine.<eos> And, son... get yourself some eye drops while you're at it.<eos> Hey. You work here now?<eos> You drink coffee now?
But you saw it.<eos> Yeah, but I didn't, like, trace the handwriting.<eos> I didn't think it was that big a deal.<eos> Do you think she's right?<eos> Does everything that happened to her go back to you and that list?
You want to think whatever you did couldn't be why Hannah killed herself.<eos> But the truth is that I did, I killed Hannah Baker!<eos> And Justin killed Hannah Baker.<eos> And Jessica.<eos> And you.
It seems like nothing.<eos> Until the hurricane hits.<eos> Because when you put my name on that list, you put a target on my... well, it wasn't just my ass.<eos> You made it open season on Hannah Baker.<eos> Hi, are... are you Wally?
You looking for a cold one?<eos> Tough day?<eos> No, I just...<eos> I came to grab some sugary carbonated matter.<eos> Stuff's not good for you, man.
No, I really gotta...<eos> No, the least you can do is drink with us.<eos> Come on.<eos> Drink your 40.<eos> Alex, you're up, man!
Yeah, I am.<eos> I'll shoot in his spot.<eos> Oh, fuck.<eos> The butterfly effect.<eos> It started with Justin, then on to you, Alex.
Why would I need your help...<eos> I mean, yeah, sure.<eos> Whatever.<eos> Think about it, Jensen.<eos> I have a better grade than you in French.
It's just graffiti, right?<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> In honor of Halloween, your in-class essay today will analyze this quote from chapter four of Beyond Good and Evil:<eos> "Whoever fights monsters should see to it that he does not become a monster."<eos> I'm worried about you, Clay.
I fell in love with that.<eos> Real.<eos> So, yeah, I took pictures of her, but that's because girls like that don't hang out with the yearbook guy, with me.<eos> Why didn't you just talk to her?<eos> Why didn't you?
Good.<eos> 'Cause I'm tired of it all anyway.<eos> - Clay.<eos> - Oh, it speaks!<eos> Clay, those guys are using you.
You don't think they'll figure it out?<eos> I shouldn't even be seen talking to you right now.<eos> - Because of a stupid picture?<eos> - Come on, Hannah.<eos> You of all people should know what a picture can do to a person's life.
The only difference is, Tyler you got caught.<eos> Guys, I have to go out after dinner, okay?<eos> Won't be long.<eos> Where you going?<eos> What are you doing here?
Oh, just Courtney.<eos> And her court.<eos> The Courtnettes.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You?
- Go! - Go!<eos> Do it.<eos> You think so?<eos> Uh, you can keep up?<eos> Hey. Maybe you and Hannah are up for some fun later.
Like just a reason to put posters up.<eos> I'm trying to help the school heal.<eos> The school?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What about you?
Clay, look, I know she was special to you.<eos> And I know you're upset, and I get it, but... but this was Hannah's choice.<eos> Okay, this isn't on anyone but her.<eos> No.<eos> No, it's on every person who talked shit about her, and every guy who fucked her over, and it's on you because she thought you were a friend, and you sent one more asshole in her direction just to cover the fact you're gay.
No, it's on every person who talked shit about her, and every guy who fucked her over, and it's on you because she thought you were a friend, and you sent one more asshole in her direction just to cover the fact you're gay.<eos> That's not true.<eos> I don't get it, Courtney.<eos> It's the 21st century.<eos> How is this so hard for you?
That's not true.<eos> I don't get it, Courtney.<eos> It's the 21st century.<eos> How is this so hard for you?<eos> Was it hard for you?
What do you think everyone would say?<eos> "She's got two gay dads, that's why she's..."<eos> And my dads, they've taken so much crap, my whole life, for being gay and then for being dads, and I just can't...<eos> I couldn't do that to them.<eos> What people think of you isn't more important than Hannah's life.
I don't know why.<eos> For mix tapes, of course.<eos> A lost and essential art.<eos> What's this?<eos> That starts with the song you and Clay danced to.
I want to eat Mike and Ikes out of the box with her at the Crestmont.<eos> I want to dance with her again, and... kiss her... when I should have kissed her.<eos> But I can't.<eos> Don't you feel like someone should pay for that?<eos> Aren't you?
- Alex, calm the fuck down.<eos> - You calm down! I am calm!<eos> Man, I'm so fucking calm.<eos> You don't want to do this.<eos> - You think I'm scared of you?
I don't know why people act like that.<eos> People can be fucking assholes.<eos> It's a school full of assholes.<eos> I mean, right? But...<eos> I don't think you're an asshole.
And I don't think you're a...<eos> I mean, can girls be assholes?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Trust me.<eos> So, yeah. You're not.
- Listen, dude.<eos> I needed a "C" average or above to play baseball.<eos> U.S. History was kicking my ass.<eos> And I got help, right?<eos> What about you, dude?
Yeah, but... wait a second.<eos> How do I know you're telling the truth?<eos> Maybe I'm not on your list.<eos> Hey, well, if you go out with me, I can show you.<eos> - Says you.
- Listen...<eos> - Nope, no "listen."<eos> What follows "listen" is nothing good.<eos> Let me put it this way. Repeat after me:<eos> "Marcus, I will definitely go out with you."
What about Dollar Valentines?<eos> I didn't really do it.<eos> Couldn't afford it, huh?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What about you?
Yeah.<eos> All right, take care.<eos> Thanks.<eos> The hell was that?<eos> You tell me.
But I'm not supposed to be your valentine.<eos> Sweetheart, you're always going to be my valentine.<eos> It's a little creepy, don't you think?<eos> You're not trying to turn me into Norman Bates or something, are you?<eos> You know what, that movie theater job... I don't think it's healthy for you.
Um, Triple Americano, and a double mocha with extra little chocolate sprinkles.<eos> Extra little chocolate sprinkles.<eos> Got it.<eos> So, what? You're into cheerleaders now?<eos> It's you and Carrie?
I wasn't.<eos> That's okay.<eos> I wasn't...<eos> I wasn't thinking of anyone.<eos> But... but you.
I'm sorry, too.<eos> I love you.<eos> And we will... keep going and keep searching and keep fighting for as long as you want to.<eos> As long as we have to.<eos> Whatever they throw at us... it's you and me against the world.
Okay?<eos> You showed real strength of character.<eos> You always do.<eos> We don't agree on everything, but we can agree on that.<eos> Proud of you, pal.
I heard the stirrings.<eos> Some, uh... thumps and mutterings and such.<eos> We need to get him back to Dr. Ellman.<eos> He won't take the meds, but the talk therapy was always helpful.<eos> Feel like it was more helpful for you to have him doing it.
Right.<eos> Sometimes the silly things can mean more than anyone knows.<eos> Get a good one?<eos> Nothing earthshaking.<eos> You?
Yo, dude!<eos> There he is!<eos> For those who aren't Zach, you can relax.<eos> For now, at least.<eos> As for you, Zach... I wonder if you ever felt what it's like to be lonely.
Big deal.<eos> You should have let it go.<eos> But you didn't let it go.<eos> You didn't like that someone told you no.<eos> 'Cause guys like you get anything you want, right?
Yo, Jess.<eos> You're not leaving, are you?<eos> I'm benched for the game.<eos> Or didn't the entire gym just hear that?<eos> Well, if you're benched, take a seat.
I think I'm losing my shit.<eos> Shit's overrated.<eos> Lose it.<eos> I'm gonna be in so much trouble.<eos> Not if no one knows you did it.
- They're doing shit to my head.<eos> - I get it. I get it.<eos> I don't think you do.<eos> I do. Believe me.<eos> This is all so easy for you.
I don't know if I will.<eos> He's one intense dude.<eos> He's just going through some shit.<eos> Yeah, clearly.<eos> And so are you.
- Don't.<eos> - Why not?<eos> Because.<eos> Well, do your folks know?<eos> About you and Hannah?
What kind of lonely could the great Zach Dempsey possibly feel?<eos> Dempsey, what the fuck?<eos> We gonna take a long lunch or what?<eos> Uh, yeah, I don't know.<eos> Come on, man, we need you.
I didn't cry.<eos> Fuck you, man.<eos> Maybe that kind where you think no one truly sees you.<eos> I know that kind of lonely.<eos> Do you?
I'm sad for Hannah... and for all of us who... who cared about her.<eos> So, are you gonna punish me or what?<eos> Is that what you want me to do?<eos> Do you get a lot of kids coming in here asking for punishment?<eos> What do you think your punishment should be?
-I'm sorry.<eos> -No, that's okay.<eos> You're hurting.<eos> And I want to help.<eos> I want to be there for you, Clay.
What if we make it look like a suicide.<eos> How tragic is that?<eos> I mean, two star-crossed lovers or some shit like that.<eos> Grow up, Justin.<eos> Are you really telling me to grow up, Little Mama's Boy?
You coming or not? In a minute.<eos> I'm talking to Alex.<eos> Oh, about what?<eos> About how much she misses me.<eos> About how much better of a boyfriend I am than you.
What the hell does this have to do with Hannah?<eos> Don't you want to find out?<eos> "O, tall mountains and Mother Earth" and all this other hooey.<eos> I don't think I'm going back.<eos> Well, I think it's fine if you don't want to, but maybe you should give it a chance.
I'm gonna go get my coat.<eos> It's in the back, so...<eos> What do you want, Ryan?<eos> We're legitimately closed.<eos> I have something for you.
It's an easy climb.<eos> All the answers you seek are at the top of the cliff.<eos> The drag of your hand across my chest<eos> Sparks a blaze my lips cannot extinguish<eos> You, stubborn inferno
Of your hands<eos> That was... intense.<eos> Thank you?<eos> Yes, thank you.<eos> I want to write like you.
Have you ever seen a crime scene?<eos> Well, like...<eos> CSI and Law Order, all that.<eos> Like a... a real one.<eos> Have you?
But is that why you really did it?<eos> So you could help me touch just one person?<eos> What?<eos> I doubt it.<eos> People like you don't make selfless moves.
Trust me.<eos> So that guy Brad... is he your boyfriend now?<eos> I hope he's still my boyfriend.<eos> He's been pretty annoyed lately because... I've been spending all my time with another guy.<eos> You.
What?<eos> Should we move?<eos> Should we go somewhere and start new?<eos> And... give up the store?<eos> I'll give up the store, give up the house, everything... if I have you.
Did you and Tony talk yesterday?<eos> We sure did.<eos> Okay, and you're just... doing your own thing.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, look, I understand that you're going through your own process or whatever, but I'm worried about you, man.
Was she his girlfriend?<eos> Did he do something to her?<eos> Jesus, Lainie... what are you implying?<eos> I am defending a lawsuit brought by two parents whose daughter was so damaged by something that she took her own life.<eos> What if our son was part of that? He's not capable of it. How do you know?
Can I come in?<eos> You okay?<eos> I just talked to Justin about Jessica.<eos> Okay.<eos> How did everyone... how did you... just listen to that, and, like, ignore it?
Your dad hates me.<eos> He does not.<eos> He does. Last summer he told me I was trouble, and that I'd better toe the line.<eos> That's just a thing he says to guys.<eos> You got it way easier than Alex.
No.<eos> Clay, you don't understand.<eos> I do understand.<eos> Every drama has to be your drama, or it doesn't count.<eos> Somehow this is all about you.
It's just a stupid light bulb.<eos> What the fuck is wrong with you?<eos> When did you become such a pussy?<eos> - Hey, why are you acting crazy?<eos> - Why aren't you?
I always liked him too.<eos> He was always nice to me before.<eos> Tyler, what do you want?<eos> Let's talk to him.<eos> You and me.
These are thousand dollar cameras.<eos> I'll break 'em on your face.<eos> Jesus, Montgomery, leave him alone.<eos> - You want to go again?<eos> - Do you?
- Because every day hurts.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> Every day they live not knowing the truth.<eos> They need this, Sheri.<eos> - They do, or you do?
There's so much hurt.<eos> I couldn't take knowing I'd made it worse.<eos> And I couldn't take knowing it would never get any better.<eos> I thought you'd be here.<eos> I think I will join you.
Because how could I have known?<eos> But it was the same night. That same awful night.<eos> Remember that story I was saving for later?<eos> Well, this is it.<eos> And it's all about you...
Clay, I know you're asking yourself why you're on these tapes.<eos> What could you possibly have done?<eos> What else could have happened the night of Jessica's party?<eos> Well, good luck with your fresh start.<eos> Good luck to you, party animal.
I'm digging this role reversal, by the way.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> You got this rebel with a cause thing going on.<eos> Well... that's me.<eos> - Jeff's a good influence on you. - You think?
You'd never kick my ass.<eos> Don't tempt me.<eos> - How am I tempting you?<eos> - Go talk to her, man.<eos> You're the reason she came.
Well, I look forward to it.<eos> Yeah, me too.<eos> I actually didn't ride my bike here, so we can't do that.<eos> So, but I'll go get the drinks.<eos> Yeah, I think I'm gonna come with you if it's cool.
- Don't you ever touch me.<eos> - Get out of my house. - It's not your house.<eos> - You think it's yours?<eos> - You pay rent?<eos> - Do you?
- Why?<eos> - My parents need me to work at the store.<eos> Which kind of sucks, because I really like working at the Crestmont.<eos> I do too.<eos> What I mean is, I like working with you.
That's what matters.<eos> Justin's just...<eos> He's just going through some stuff.<eos> He'll be back.<eos> So, like you do, you go outside to work things out.
Come on in.<eos> We got leftovers, we got steak, we got all the fixings.<eos> Pam.<eos> Working late.<eos> You too.
There's no winning or losing.<eos> You shuffle to transfer your energy to the cards.<eos> Now cut the deck.<eos> So, uh... what do the cards say?<eos> This one, nine of wands, but it's reversed, which means you feel the world is against you.
They said you had the best...<eos> I hear you two like a guy between you.<eos> Did Justin finger you?<eos> I bet you went down on him.<eos> - And they all became you.
You're good and kind... and decent.<eos> And I didn't deserve to be with someone like you.<eos> I never would.<eos> I would have ruined you.<eos> It wasn't you.
I knew I shouldn't have left.<eos> And then Bryce raped Jessica.<eos> Hannah saw, then Sheri knocked down the stop sign, then Jeff died, and it all started with me!<eos> Clay.<eos> I think you gotta get back from that edge.
So you can die?<eos> - Reunite with Hannah forever?<eos> - Fuck you, Tony.<eos> You think you could have changed anything?<eos> What does that make you?
- I really do.<eos> - You know what people will say?<eos> No.<eos> And I don't care.<eos> Because it's easy for you, right?
Because you're not the class slut.<eos> - Don't say that.<eos> - Everybody says it!<eos> - I don't say it.<eos> - Yes, you did.
Listen, man, I don't know what happened last night.<eos> I don't know what I did to set you off all of the sudden, and I just...<eos> It's fucking killing me that you can't talk to me about it, so... talk to me.<eos> Okay? Please?<eos> I love you, man.
The Bakers are broke, right, and Bryce's family has the money to make this all go away?<eos> Nothing we did compares to what he did.<eos> - You're fucking joking, right?<eos> - Are you gonna defend Bryce?<eos> No, but aren't you?
Why not, Tyler?<eos> You got more secrets you're trying to hide?<eos> You can do whatever you want.<eos> No one's going to believe you.<eos> People'll just laugh at you, like they always do.
You just got here.<eos> Sorry, I gotta go.<eos> Don't go.<eos> - We're just having fun.<eos> You and Hannah... you had sex with her that night.
A week before she slit her wrists and died at home, you raped her.<eos> She came to my party.<eos> Mine. She got in the hot tub with me, without a suit on.<eos> Right? And she made eyes.<eos> I know that's hard for you to hear, that your crush wasn't pure and clean.
Respect.<eos> Jesus, Jensen.<eos> Respect.<eos> So she wanted it.<eos> She got in the hot tub with you. And that means she wanted it.
What the hell is this?<eos> - None of your business.<eos> - It is my business.<eos> I got commerce to do here, which does not work with the sheriff's department banging on my door, understand?<eos> No, I don't understand you, because that's not your fucking door!
Please, the woman next door will call the cops.<eos> We're done.<eos> Mom.<eos> IthoughtmaybeIcouldforget about what had happened.<eos> But thanks to you, Bryce... I'd finally lived up to my reputation.
but he seems to think that, uh, we may be able to get you out of having to go.<eos> And it's not that I don't have sympathy for these parents, kiddo, but you didn't have anything to do with this, and shouldn't have to be put through it.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> You're a good kid, Alex.<eos> I'm proud of you.
I climbed up this crane, all the way up there, and I could... I could see the whole city.<eos> And I was gonna jump.<eos> Or shoot myself.<eos> But I couldn't.<eos> Because I couldn't stop thinking about you.
Hey, what the hell we waitin' on?<eos> Waiting for them.<eos> Who dares to trespass on the sovereign land of the...<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Jesus, is that you?
The car stays outside.<eos> You gotta hand over your guns.<eos> We only have two.<eos> Follow me.<eos> Before we go in, you have a brain and a backbone, so I'm talking to you, not Gregory.
We've been told you have a deal with them, that you know them.<eos> Then you know they rule through violence and fear.<eos> Your Majesty, I only told them of the...<eos> Our deal with the Saviors is not known among my people... for good cause.<eos> We made you a party to that secret when you told us of the Hilltop's own travails, but we did not expect you to share...
We brought you into our confidence.<eos> Why did you break it?<eos> Because I want you to hear Rick's plans.<eos> And what plans have you, Rick Grimes of Alexandria?<eos> We came to ask the Kingdom, to ask you, to join us in fighting the Saviors, fighting for freedom for all of us.
Oh. Practicing shooting.<eos> Let me give you some advice.<eos> It's gonna be dark soon.<eos> Don't wander around out here on your own. You'll get yourself killed.<eos> Same goes for you, too, right?
Ezekiel, you know I can't have this.<eos> We can't have this.<eos> Richard will refrain from attending our future exchanges. No.<eos> No, Ezekiel, you're gonna keep bringing him.<eos> 'Cause if this doesn't stop, if this starts becoming a real problem, you remember what I said.
'Cause I got to tell you, that is one hell of a coincidence, her leaving just a few short hours after Daryl took off.<eos> And he didn't force his way out.<eos> No. Somebody opened the door for him.<eos> It wasn't Sherry.<eos> Dwighty boy... was it you?
You change your stripes on me, Dwighty?<eos> You startin' to see things different?<eos> After all this... before and after... hell, after everything...<eos> I'm Negan.<eos> Daryl isn't like you.
I'm Negan.<eos> Daryl isn't like you.<eos> He's... emotional.<eos> So he's either on his way home, or he's coming back here to try to kill some more of us.<eos> Mostly you and me.
So... do you think you know where Sherry went?<eos> Bring her back.<eos> Stitch him up.<eos> Fix what you can fix.<eos> You don't think she did it?
Bring her back.<eos> Stitch him up.<eos> Fix what you can fix.<eos> You don't think she did it?<eos> You think she did?
D...wealwayssaid that if we got separated, I should come back here and wait for you. You'd show up with beer and pretzels.<eos> You remember that? I know. You probably don't.<eos> You always said that when we started dating, you forgot to tell me you had a shitty memory.<eos> You used to get so frustrated by it... knowing you wouldn't remember those good days... those special days.<eos> I felt bad for you.
I hope you remember the good days, even just one of them, but...<eos> I don't think you will.<eos> I don't think you'll ever read this.<eos> I loved who you were.<eos> I'm sorry I made you into who you are.
No, no, no, no!<eos> Why?<eos> I didn't do anything. I found this little souvenir tucked away in your desk.<eos> I-I-I don't know what that is.<eos> You... left the door open and let my puppy out.
Please...<eos> That's all you had to say.<eos> That is all you had to say.<eos> A good thing we got a spare Dr. Carson.<eos> I trust you, Dwighty boy.
That is a correct assessment.<eos> May I come in?<eos> So, how you liking it here?<eos> Are we doing right by Dr. Smarty-pants?<eos> You know, Frankie and Tanya... nothing but good things to say about you.
Hey, you want to get burned by molten metal?<eos> 'Cause that's exactly how you get burned by molten metal.<eos> Regarding me clamping down...<eos> You on board?<eos> I am. Just like you.
Think we can?<eos> Yeah, we can.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Y-Yeah.<eos> Are you?
And now they're gone, and I'm here because I was stupid enough to listen to you.<eos> But you were.<eos> You stand there telling people about their lives.<eos> Only if they come here.<eos> Like you.
Like you.<eos> Right now.<eos> You don't know shit about shit.<eos> I don't.<eos> I said that you weren't supposed to die and that you shouldn't do the thing that you were planning to do because we needed you... still do.
I can push. So can I.<eos> You just worry about steering us in that gap.<eos> Shit.<eos> Michonne, you good?<eos> Yeah. You?
- Nah. We can do this.<eos> Yeah, I know we can.<eos> How you doing? !<eos> Eight more!<eos> How about you?
I can't lose you.<eos> You asked me what kind of life we had just surrendering.<eos> It wasn't...<eos> It wasn't a life.<eos> What we did back there, what we're doing now, making a future for Judith and for Glenn and Maggie's baby, fighting the fight, that's living. You showed me that.
I can lose you.<eos> We can lose our friends, people we love.<eos> It's not about us anymore.<eos> It's about a future.<eos> And if it's me who doesn't make it, you're gonna have to lead the others forward because you're the one who can.
It's not about us anymore.<eos> It's about a future.<eos> And if it's me who doesn't make it, you're gonna have to lead the others forward because you're the one who can.<eos> But... how do you know?<eos> Because... you led me here.
There's only two of us.<eos> You changing your mind?<eos> I'm ready to kill him.<eos> But I need to make sure you know what this means.<eos> Do you?
I was getting tired of looking at that nail.<eos> So, who's the girl?<eos> We're at, like, "three minutes go" right now, so...<eos> Kid's too young to be a father.<eos> Were you one?
I was, thank God.<eos> But I wasn't too young... perfect age, perfect time.<eos> I had myself the perfect family and the perfect life.<eos> I didn't ask for much, and I got more than I deserved.<eos> And you?
Uh... group home.<eos> This isn't like that, though.<eos> Not the bad parts, at least.<eos> For the first time, I feel like I belong.<eos> Trying to make sure you and Sasha became a part of this made me a part of this.
- Then I'll go, too.<eos> - Me, too.<eos> No. The Hilltop has to be ready for what happens after.<eos> Maggie needs you.<eos> She needs you, too.
I know you can.<eos> But I know you won't and she won't, but I wish you would.<eos> 'Cause it's a long life, and then it isn't.<eos> You can take anything else you need.<eos> But you and Rosita need to talk to Maggie.
But you and Rosita need to talk to Maggie.<eos> You owe her that much.<eos> Listen...<eos> Enid...<eos> Maggie trusts you.
It's for the baby.<eos> Maybe you can work on it while I'm gone.<eos> Sasha...<eos> In 10 minutes, I'm gonna tell Maggie what's going on.<eos> It's up to you what you want to do with that.
You have a certain somebody that, uh... now needs to be Negan's certain somebody, so what you can do for me is point me in their direction.<eos> So, who is it?<eos> You get your pointy finger up, and I'll tells ya.<eos> Daryl.<eos> Did you dig that tunnel?
What the hell are you doing?<eos> Go.<eos> It's not your time.<eos> There's got to be a point to it, right?<eos> They need you.
I know you don't want this.<eos> Didn't want this, but I'm starting to understand what's on the menu now.<eos> We can hide like these people, we can keep trying to serve The Saviors, and I can watch you get randomly beaten every so often, or else we can fight.<eos> So, here we are.<eos> And being with you, well... it makes abject terror tolerable.
I'm sorry you had to see that.<eos> Sorry 'bout the rope, too.<eos> Probably overkill, but you did cause one hell of a fracas last night.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> I remember you.
Unh-unh. Just the opposite.<eos> See, this...<eos> Well, this could be the beginning.<eos> This knife is yours now.<eos> You can try to use it, take me out, but considering I am standing above you, holding a baseball bat, that doesn't seem real smart.
I'm a man short.<eos> Hell, you can't really call this piece of shit a man, but still, I'm short, and you got those beach-ball-sized lady nuts, and I wanna harness the heat comin' off of 'em.<eos> You can help me run this place one day, all of us together, following the rules, workin' on the same side of things.<eos> That's all this was ever about.<eos> And it still can be for you.
Full disclosure, the pillow is not hypoallergenic.<eos> There was some debate as to whether or not I should come in here.<eos> They said in the event of a hostage situation with the pig sticker that I would fully be on my own.<eos> Just wanted to share that.<eos> Negan relayed to me his offer to you.
And then the pants-pissing terror of the rinse and repeat of that very same event...<eos> I just...<eos> I couldn't.<eos> Being here means I'll never have to again.<eos> And neither will you if you just say "yes."
We're not giving up.<eos> I didn't want to break my promise, Cyndie, okay?<eos> But the world can belong to good people, to fair people, if we're all just brave enough to try.<eos> We are not good, and we are not brave.<eos> Neither you nor me.
You're gonna want to pack a bag.<eos> Hello?<eos> It's Eugene.<eos> Word in the halls is that you're all-in with things here.<eos> It may not seem like it now, but I assure you, you, too, made the correct select.
It will bring about certain death in approximately 20 to 30 minutes upon the moment of ingestion.<eos> I would like to believe that it's painless.<eos> I am not -- I'm not certain.<eos> I made it at the behest of others for similar reasons, only it came to pass that they were feeding me the bum's steer, so I cut bait.<eos> The difference here is that you and I have been long-time traveling companions, and you have proven yourself to be honest, brave, and fully self-aware.
Wake up.<eos> What is it?<eos> Do we need to... No, no, no.<eos> We're okay for now.<eos> Well, good afternoon to you.
I don't wanna see that.<eos> So you don't have to.<eos> But someone does.<eos> Maybe a couple others... tops.<eos> But not you and not most people.
But not anymore.<eos> What I did, I was doing it for someone else.<eos> She just got away.<eos> So now I'm here.<eos> So are you because of her.
- Yes.<eos> - Good.<eos> I think you'll get adjusted to the place, sinus-wise.<eos> No, I won't.<eos> Not like you.
Where's Negan?<eos> I'm Negan.<eos> We win.<eos> You ever hear the one about the stupid little prick named Rick who thought he knew shit but didn't know shit and got everyone he that gave a shit about killed?<eos> It's about you.
Please take it with my compliments.<eos> I truly wish I measured up.<eos> You still can, Eugene.<eos> I'm not giving up.<eos> Not on you.
I gotta tell you, Rick, if I had a kid, I'd want him to be just like your kid, which makes this so much harder.<eos> You're not gonna win.<eos> Carl.<eos> It is over.<eos> Why don't you point your one ball up the street there and take it all in?
And this isn't a warning.<eos> This is punishment.<eos> I'm gonna kill Carl now.<eos> I'm gonna make it one nice, hard swing, try to do it in one because I like him.<eos> I just want you to put that in your brain and roll it around for a minute.
And now we mean everything to each other.<eos> You were in trouble.<eos> You were trapped.<eos> Glenn didn't know you, but he helped you.<eos> He put himself in danger for you.
Cheers, love.<eos> Oh, and can you turn the AC down a bit?<eos> It's hotter than shit in here.<eos> Chrissy... thanks for the breakfast.<eos> Don't know what we'd do without you, love.
I don't care how some motherfucker sees me in his head, you know?<eos> It's, uh...<eos> It's useless.<eos> You fucking die, you're gone.<eos> Nobody's thinking about you.
What?<eos> Someone's here.<eos> Oh, hey, man.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I have a gift for you.
She does a great job for you, but she's a manager.<eos> Sometimes they cloud the message.<eos> I want you to know exactly... exactly how important you are to this promotion, okay?<eos> Please.<eos> It's a gift from me to you, no strings.
I want you to know exactly... exactly how important you are to this promotion, okay?<eos> Please.<eos> It's a gift from me to you, no strings.<eos> One string.<eos> You come out with me tonight, let me show you the love.
Look, the guy... he's an asshole, okay?<eos> I'd like to shoot him in the fucking face, but I don't because I have a lot to lose.<eos> Oh, man, you're... Look, you're a nice guy, okay?<eos> But you're acting crazy, and I just... I can't... I can't get sued.<eos> Maybe this isn't for you, man.
Man, you got a problem.<eos> What?<eos> Um... people know, man.<eos> People know what?<eos> Um, about you.
What happened?<eos> She's fine.<eos> She did a scene.<eos> Fuck.<eos> What's wrong with you?
Let's do it!<eos> Yes!<eos> Take it easy.<eos> Hey, hey, hey, take it easy.<eos> I need you sober.
You've been keeping your lip zipped about it since Grandpa got arrested, but the fact is, you're freaking stoked to bail on him.<eos> He bails on everybody!<eos> He bailed on Mom when she was a kid!<eos> He - - He bailed on tiny planet!<eos> And in case I never made this clear to you, Summer, he bailed on you.
Look at him go.<eos> [ Laughs ] Ha ha, yeah!<eos> We'll be lenient if you renounce your Rick.<eos> What say you, Summer?<eos> I say [bleep] you!
My first shot would liquify her insides and injure you, second shot adds recoil.<eos> The risk to me is minimized if I wait for you to shoot her, which I'm encouraging you to do.<eos> What the [bleep] Or let her go, which I will reward with a quicker death.<eos> Because you love her!<eos> Because it's incentive for you to give me my cleanest shot, which will be your least painful death.
Oh, my God. Nancy says they're drawing and quartering aliens in the school courtyard, and it technically counts as patriotism.<eos> Geez! Are my parents seriously gonna get divorced?<eos> All right, Rick, I'm gonna go to my --<eos> Not so fast, Morty. You heard your mom.<eos> We've got adventures to go on, Morty -- just you and me -- and sometimes your sister and sometimes your mom, but never your dad.
Oh [bleep]<eos> I've rep[burps]laced them both as the de facto patriarch of your family and your universe.<eos> Your mom wouldn't have accepted me if I came home...<eos> Oh, man.<eos> ...without you and your sister, so now you know the real reason I rescued you.
- Fine.<eos> Just grab the stupid thing while I grab her, and let's get the "F" out of "H."<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Morty, there's too much heat on the bogey.<eos> I need you to distract the camp.
Someone, make this stop!<eos> Mister, please get out of here, or you're gonna die!<eos> I have nothing to do with this!<eos> Morty.<eos> Why would you want this to happen?
Nope.<eos> Regular blood.<eos> -Dad? -Hi, sweetie.<eos> -Where are the kids?<eos> -Oh, th--they aren't with you?
Oh, God, what's the divorce doing to the kids?<eos> What's it doing to me?<eos> Did I make a mistake?<eos> Not a mistake, no! I mean, not that I have a horse in this race, but this divorce decision -- listen -- mwah!<eos> -- good for you, good for the kids.
So, it's kind of like --<eos> Do you guys have the phrase "hat on a hat"?<eos> -I can shave it.<eos> -No. I like it. And obviously what I like shouldn't matter.<eos> It's you.
[ Chuckles nervously ]<eos> Yeah, dial it back, Summer... by 15% and increase dynamic movement by 3%.<eos> Am I right?<eos> -How's school, Morty?<eos> I like school and stuff, kind of. And I'm getting better grades than when you and Dad were -- quote mode -- "staying together for the kids."
[ Power fades ] Tell it to my bread in the morning. You just became my backup toaster.<eos> [ Chuckles ] Aw, geez, my sister died in the spaghetti.<eos> [ All grunting ]<eos> Graze my genitals again, Taint Washer, and you'll be shipped to the wasteland.<eos> And as for you, Genital Washer --
-Sorry, sorry. I-I-I can wait for this to wrap up.<eos> Don't let me distract you.<eos> Yeah, well, too late.<eos> Just tell me what you want.<eos> I want you and your sister to come home.
But, I mean, you know, your mom could put me in a purse or a pocket, you know, if she really needs me to go.<eos> Nobody needs anything.<eos> Okay, it's fine.<eos> I mean, you should just stay here and figure out how to stop being a pickle, okay?<eos> Hey, Rick, why is there a syringe of mysterious fluid hanging directly over you?
It's really important, so don't break it.<eos> Okay, I may have fucked up here.<eos> Oh, great.<eos> Stupid cat.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! I know what it looks like to you, Izzy, but I'm not a snake!
- Anti-pickle serum. - It's anti-pickle serum.<eos> Your kids think it might be anti-pickle serum.<eos> My kids pee their desks and suck on unbaked vases.<eos> They're just angry at me for divorcing their father.<eos> I never said I was angry at you.
F-15s are scrambled.<eos> This helicopter will be shot down in seven minutes.<eos> Well, my daughter is about five away, and I've got about eight to live.<eos> Pickle Man, it's too late for me to tell my daughter<eos> I love her, but not for you.
Don't let any of those things get away, Morty.<eos> It their DNA gets into Earth's food chain, our entire species could be sterilized.<eos> Then why aren't we killing them?<eos> Right, next time I need a species sterilized, who's gonna do it for me, you?
This article says the reason we weren't involved was...<eos> "personality conflicts."<eos> Don't worry, Morty, they love you.<eos> Superheroes need a wide-eyed unremarkable to tag along and react to everything like it's mind blowing.<eos> I... think the personality conflict might have been... you?
What's going on, buddy?<eos> Obviously, I came here last night during a blackout.<eos> "Obviously?"<eos> You came here and defeated our arch nemesis... while so drunk you don't remember doing it?<eos> That's something "obvious" to you?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> Hold on, Vance.<eos> He said you'd die if you tried to leave.<eos> That means there's booby traps.<eos> Why are you acting like that's not you?
We had a child together!<eos> What? !<eos> I conceived a child with Million Ants and it died inside me because it was half a million ants and half collapsing star!<eos> And yes.<eos> He was better than you.
But you're betting our lives on it.<eos> I'll cover that bet.<eos> I get it.<eos> Well, Morty, I think you're doing that smirky face because you're misinterpreting the moment.<eos> I am not being coy about some hidden love for you.
Just let Titty Bean do this, Snuzzles.<eos> It's for the greater good.<eos> Greater good?<eos> Titty Bean?<eos> It's like you said, Morty.
On top of co-signing your mortgage so you could get your apartment.<eos> Not that I mind, happy to help really.<eos> But where does it...<eos> See that's not the way I see it.<eos> That's you paying me back for...
Nobody took advantage. It was a trade.<eos> If I had a time machine, you'd see I'd play back the tape.<eos> "Emmit come on, I'm begging ya. Take the stupid stamps already.<eos> Give me the car."<eos> No, that's not, that was you tricking me.
Then we don't need to borrow money from your stupid brother or nobody else.<eos> Right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Baby look at me.<eos> We're a team you and me.
I know.<eos> We played so good.<eos> I know it was amazing.<eos> So good.<eos> Oh my God, I am so proud of you.
What did you do?<eos> Listen, don't be...<eos> Putting your hands on me, you're raising the tone of your voice, not after the night I had.<eos> You didn't, do...<eos> The risk I took on account of you. Your needs.
I said, what's going on here?<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> Blacksmith pays for these.<eos> Jeweler pays for these.<eos> The law pays for you.
It is far from a foregone conclusion that they'll be inclined to offer me their help.<eos> But, given our state of affairs, it seems more than worth a try.<eos> And unlike in the past... I now have something to offer them that may make the ask more attractive.<eos> What's that?<eos> You.
Meanwhile... the door will be open for you to reach your grandfather and gain his aid.<eos> Why you?<eos> Why not have someone else lead him away?<eos> Because he won't leave that position to chase someone else.<eos> He'd chase you, and I believe, given the opportunity, he might chase me for a chance at ending this regime once and for all.
Philadelphia?<eos> What is in Philadelphia worth leaving things here in this state?<eos> My grandfather spent his winters there negotiating with his suppliers for the spring.<eos> I'll find him there and secure his assistance.<eos> I must strongly advise against it, against you and the governor being gone in this moment.
An English governor raising his flag over Nassau.<eos> Fuck Teach.<eos> He was almost the end of us.<eos> But now I'm here... and things are about to begin again.<eos> You?
500 pieces?<eos> You think you're worth more?<eos> To the right people.<eos> Who?<eos> Who would pay so much for you?
I imagine I have some obligation to surrender you to Captain Berringer, but the spectacle he would make of your trial and execution would only fan the flames of what is burning in Nassau now.<eos> I am tempted to put the sword to you and your man both, and bury this story for good, but what am I... if I spend my days pleading for a return to civility and then do dark things under the cover of night?<eos> So, you will remain in my custody until I can find a place far from here to deposit you.<eos> You will be gone, but you will live.<eos> And for that, I will consider whatever debts I may owe you to be paid in full.
- I accidentally signed it.<eos> - The school was not doing nothing.<eos> The petition we will get squashed.<eos> I am more concerned... some of the children have been instructed not to play with Ziggy.<eos> - Are you behind this petition?
- Are you behind this petition?<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - I asked you a fucking question. - Hey, whoa, whoa.<eos> - Calm down. - Don't fucking threaten me.<eos> - Was it you?
My daughter is the one getting hurt and I can't stop it.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Me, too.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.
- Congrats on your opening night.<eos> Thank you, honey.<eos> I don't really have anything to do with it anymore.<eos> You have a huge amount to do with it.<eos> It wouldn't even be happening but for you. Are you kidding?
- Madeline.<eos> - Hi, Tori. Hello.<eos> - Congratulations.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> And to you, too.
- Thank you.<eos> And to you, too.<eos> Joseph was great.<eos> And I feel like it went really well.<eos> - Was it you?
Joseph was great.<eos> And I feel like it went really well.<eos> - Was it you?<eos> - I'm sorry?<eos> Are you the woman Joseph is in love with?
I know he had an affair a year ago.<eos> I can tell when he lies.<eos> - Okay... - He also... told me he was over her.<eos> Which... I can tell when he lies.<eos> Was it you?
So, you think our marriage is pretend?<eos> No, I said that in every marriage there is pretending.<eos> Even the best ones.<eos> You said it was the essence, if I heard you correctly.<eos> I mean, I don't pretend to love you. I know you don't pretend to love me.
No, I said that in every marriage there is pretending.<eos> Even the best ones.<eos> You said it was the essence, if I heard you correctly.<eos> I mean, I don't pretend to love you. I know you don't pretend to love me.<eos> But what I do like to pretend, as do you, is that I'm all that.
- I'm running late.<eos> Um, hey, just... just take a second, please?<eos> Listen, I think the idea behind what you're doing, it's extremely noble.<eos> What other 16-year-old even has a social conscience, you know?<eos> So, I'm proud of you.
First of all, she flat-out accuses me, and now she's going all Glenn Close?<eos> She suspects, she doesn't know. I did a good job of denying it.<eos> Not that my capacity for denial would be a fraction of yours.<eos> Yeah, well, I'm busy.<eos> - The thing about you, Madeline, is that...
Do you actually feel sick or do you just not want to go to school?<eos> I feel sick.<eos> You don't sound congested.<eos> I have aches.<eos> Is it possible your heart aches 'cause the other kids were told not to play with you?
Is it possible your heart aches 'cause the other kids were told not to play with you?<eos> 'Cause I would certainly understand that.<eos> Friends play with me.<eos> Josh, Chloe, Skye, Amabella.<eos> Amabella Klein plays with you?
Ziggy, point to who it is.<eos> - Really?<eos> - I don't know what to do.<eos> Well, you have to tell Celeste.<eos> She's going to want to hear it directly from you.
Divorce messes kids up pretty good.<eos> So splitting up can negatively affect the kids?<eos> Wish I had known that before I walked out.<eos> Wait, did I?<eos> Why do you gotta turn everything into a fucking fight?
Don't start.<eos> I really wish you hadn't confronted them like that.<eos> I'm not just gonna stand around and do nothing.<eos> Great, I'm the one that's getting vilified.<eos> Why would you be the one to get vilified?
She's really good.<eos> Yeah, I'm sure the room is full of erections.<eos> Tom and Jane?<eos> Really?<eos> Jane, is that you?
You took a vow.<eos> Yeah, to have and to hold, to respect, to cherish... they were our vows.<eos> Not smashing my head into a wall. - Not fucking hurting me.<eos> - Well, you've been violent, too.<eos> Yes, I've been violent, but only in reaction to you, only because you initiated it.
- Can we go back to the car?<eos> - Stop.<eos> Hey, have you seen Madeline?<eos> Yeah, according to Bonnie, she just stepped away.<eos> You might wanna go tend to her.
- I just... - It's okay.<eos> I was talking to Celeste and she told me that it wasn't Ziggy.<eos> And I'm...<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I've treated you and your little boy so badly.
Can I talk to you for a minute?<eos> - Please.<eos> Celeste, can I talk to you?<eos> - Can we go back to the car?<eos> I'm not coming back with you.
I think she just needs a minute.<eos> I... I appreciate your concern, but I'm talking to my wife, not you.<eos> Celeste, let's... Let's just go now.<eos> - We have to talk about it. - No!<eos> I'm not coming home with you.
A tree that provides all things to all people,<eos> "but then it was cut down, destroyed."<eos> Daniel nods. ""<eos> "You know what it means?" asked the king.<eos> "You are the tree," says Daniel.
I threw up for five days straight and apparently hallucinated multiple conversations with a burning bush.<eos> - What did it say?<eos> - Well, my Spanish wasn't so great.<eos> Something along the lines of, "Please put me out."<eos> - Where were you, John?
Ever, Kevin.<eos> We're going forever.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Without Matt?<eos> All of those years that he took care of you? He loves you.
All of those years that he took care of you? He loves you.<eos> Did you know that Matt won't let me cross the city limits?<eos> He thinks if I go over that bridge, the magical spell that woke me from my slumber will break and I'll go back into a coma.<eos> Listen, I know Matt can get carried away, but his heart's in the right place.<eos> He's writing a book about you.
No, no, no! He's not ready.<eos> - He'll destroy it! - No, he won't.<eos> The fuck I won't, John!<eos> All right, then so be it.<eos> Him I understand, but you?
- Thank you. - Oh, look, Dad!<eos> Tile! - Love you guys.<eos> - Love you, Dad. Love the house.<eos> - Don't go to the show.<eos> Sol, the only reason you want to go to her show is because you hate it when people are mad at you.
Sol, the only reason you want to go to her show is because you hate it when people are mad at you.<eos> I just prefer to have everybody like me.<eos> Or I can't leave my house... or my bed.<eos> Well, you do whatever you want, but I'm not going.<eos> Because, unlike you, I do not enjoy going to places where I'm not wanted.
This is probably the most important day of Frankie's life.<eos> How can I not be there?<eos> By not going.<eos> I'm gonna stay home and eat guacamole with a spoon, but you're welcome to go and have yet another tortured interaction with our ex-wives.<eos> So you're okay that things are lousy between you and Grace?
Maybe it's time for a little pot spray.<eos> What if none of them sell? What if all these little red dots are here at the end of the night?<eos> It doesn't matter, Frankie.<eos> You still did it. You pulled this show together.<eos> - Babe would be so proud of you.
We are... together.<eos> - That the word you were looking for?<eos> - Pretty close. - Good.<eos> - Goodness, I didn't...<eos> He is with you?
I'm fine. So, what's new?<eos> Are you seeing anybody?<eos> That's a rude question, Peter.<eos> I don't have time for that. I'm too busy with my new business.<eos> Good for you.
Are you seeing anybody?<eos> That's a rude question, Peter.<eos> I don't have time for that. I'm too busy with my new business.<eos> Good for you.<eos> No, good for you, Judy.
I don't have time for that. I'm too busy with my new business.<eos> Good for you.<eos> No, good for you, Judy.<eos> Trust me. Good for you.<eos> And maybe good for you, too, Peter, if you're open.
Have you been on the horn with Japan?<eos> I hate Japan.<eos> They only buy masterpieces.<eos> I just had a thought. I had a thought.<eos> Family can't buy paintings, but you can.
Do you even see me in that future?<eos> I don't not... see...<eos> - Not...<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> No, it's not you, Barry.
- Don't even.<eos> Come on.<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah, I'm great.<eos> They don't know anything about you.
- But I like your interpretation better.<eos> Would you like to take the happy time home with you?<eos> You know, I really would, but I can't afford it.<eos> How much you got?<eos> I'm so proud of you.
Hit me, you asshole!<eos> Have you lost it again?<eos> I'm not an asshole!<eos> You definitely are.<eos> But I was calling her an asshole, not you.
You're almost better-looking than me.<eos> You know that?<eos> Of course.<eos> You can't stand it?<eos> Of course not, how about you?
To admit a mistake at the right time can win people's hearts.<eos> Master often seems silly but he knows how to manage risk.<eos> Master I guess I overdid it.<eos> Please get up.<eos> I actually care a lot for you.
- Monkey.<eos> - You show your true face at last.<eos> I saw from the start there was something odd about you.<eos> According to legend you own the long Firecloud Spear. And move on the flaming Golden Wheel! Well met!<eos> So you're the Monkey King.
Calm down, you can all stay.<eos> I want to die.<eos> - That one.... That one is....<eos> - Me?<eos> You, the one in black at the back.
Thank you, Your Majesty.<eos> I don't agree to this.<eos> My Felicity....<eos> Master, drink some water.<eos> - You first.
Just find the right man...<eos> - ...get married, have a baby....<eos> - Have a baby settle down.<eos> I've found that man.<eos> It's you.
You want to die, so be my guest.<eos> Child, child, why<eos> Child, child<eos> Why are you so bad?<eos> I'll sing it for you.
So did she ever touch your heart?<eos> Of course not, it's a meaningless question.<eos> Did you really think I'd say yes?<eos> You women always ask the same question.<eos> So you did, you lowlife!
Thought we said 9:00.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But new chief showed up early.<eos> Wants to gather the department together first thing.<eos> So, since the department is you and me, I figured I'd come and get you.
At the anniversary party.<eos> Look, he... It's been a long time coming, you saying no to him.<eos> - Haven't I always...<eos> Like a Swiss watch. Reliable.<eos> That's you.
Let me finish.<eos> It's not, you know, easy.<eos> You've done good here, real good.<eos> With Stella, and the business...<eos> And I just wanna say, I'm proud of you, and you don't owe me anything.
I'm gonna step in and make this problem go away.<eos> - Don't...<eos> I mean... - I won't.<eos> Just give him the lay of the land.<eos> He's dead to you.
Here's a tune.<eos> It's called A Christmas Song.<eos> Looks like it's destined to become one of the Yuletide season's genuine standards.<eos> There's a problem.<eos> Is it you?
Looks like it's destined to become one of the Yuletide season's genuine standards.<eos> There's a problem.<eos> Is it you?<eos> No, Ray.<eos> It's you.
There's a problem.<eos> Is it you?<eos> No, Ray.<eos> It's you.<eos> You and your disgusting girlfriend.
Christmas.<eos> How much did he have, his account?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Uh, maybe $1 million.<eos> Your brother has $1 million, and you took, what is that, 10 grand?
Now, hold on just a...<eos> Consequences, Mr. Stussy.<eos> That's the way the cookie crumbles.<eos> Maybe a few months at Stillwater will straighten her out.<eos> These rules aren't just for you, Ray.
I've even seeded in the odd 100K as an act of good faith.<eos> Emmit, you wanna... Your problem, Mr. Feltz, is you think you started a parking lot company.<eos> You started a bank.<eos> This is a true story.<eos> When I'm done with you, they'll be sponging you off the floor.
Could be the head honcho.<eos> No.<eos> Why not?<eos> Baby, trust me.<eos> I want payback, maybe even more than you.
Car got her, but we'd grown attached.<eos> I was looking for my stamp.<eos> You know, I was thinking about her on the way over.<eos> I can't think of a single person doesn't like me.<eos> Except you.
- Them you help.<eos> When did I not help you, kid?<eos> Everything you asked.<eos> Co-signing the mortgage, repairs for the car.<eos> I'm not less than you.
- I don't...<eos> - Not to mention things you said to me.<eos> Accusations, you might say, about Ermentraub and who it was that urged caution as opposed to rushing in.<eos> Blaming me, in other words.<eos> I was thinking, maybe... you and Ray...

You may have, during the course of the day, a strong impulse to act.<eos> It's perfectly normal, a man of your station being forced to play the cuckold.<eos> But remember, it's all a matter of perspective.<eos> What's happening here is good.<eos> You and I are partners now.
It's a lot of money, 100 grand.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> I mean, we could ask for less...<eos> Are we worth less?<eos> You and me, our value, I'm saying, to the world?
It never happened!<eos> That doesn't make it any less of a fact.<eos> And I'm saying the price to convince her of the other truth is 200 grand.<eos> Stussy Lot 350, one hour.<eos> Baby, look at you.
Big whoop, I'm out of a job.<eos> She left me.<eos> Oh, well, you know, reap what you sow.<eos> You should've done what's right when you had the chance.<eos> Buddy, when I'm done with you, they'll be sponging you off the floor. Yeah?
You wanna fuck me?<eos> I'll tattoo it on my fist and come over there!<eos> Stuffed and mounted like a goddamn...<eos> Yeah, fuck you!<eos> So, if you know what's good for you, pay the damn money and pray that I'm satisfied! Hello?
...hearme?<eos> Hello?<eos> Yeah,it'sme .<eos> It 'sGloria.<eos> Oh, hey, there. I was just thinking of you.
For Christ's sake, shoot her.<eos> Okay, then.<eos> So, I've been trying to decide what to tell you about your grandpa, his demise, the root cause.<eos> He wasn't really my grandpa.<eos> Listen to me, he was one of God's creatures same as you and me.
I get to knock your brains out with my hammer.<eos> Perfect.<eos> It's too good for them.<eos> Eight grandchildren, each one smart as a table.<eos> Assaf with his music. He sounds like you.
Roger that, gunny.<eos> Someday.<eos> So, other than being blasted. By 50 times the lethal limit of radiation, You're doing surprisingly well.<eos> Who knows, Maybe you'll develop superpowers that you can use.<eos> That'd be perfect for you.
I just...<eos> I just want them dead.<eos> I never did say it, but thanks.<eos> For getting me off eros.<eos> I wouldn't have made it without you.
Come on.<eos> Me and this armor. Have been through the shit together.<eos> We got a history.<eos> I can picture it, now.<eos> You, in that suit, planting the martian flag. In the statue of liberty's tiara.
Thirty billion lumps of shit, Watching vidscreens, stuffing their faces. Full of free drugs all day.<eos> Hell, we should invade right now.<eos> You know the second-most dangerous thing. In the solar system. Next to a martian marine, is a u.N. Marine?<eos> Whoa, the earther chimes in!<eos> Yeah, I'm more martian than you, hilly.
My parents had to sacrifice to have a kid on earth, Immigrate here when I was five.<eos> We chose mars.<eos> Mars chose us.<eos> Hey, hey, he has a point, hillman.<eos> The only thing that makes you a martian. Is falling out of your mother's gravity well.
Briefing in five.<eos> I think I hear something.<eos> Violins.<eos> Schubert in d-minor.<eos> I think the lieutenant has the hots for you, bobbie.
Prep your teams.<eos> Dismissed.<eos> Gunny.<eos> Up here.<eos> I know that you and your team did a rotation on the donnie.
My julie.<eos> Even losing her was worth it.<eos> She's a sacred part of it now.<eos> So don't talk to me about sacrifice. Ever again.<eos> This'll kill any cancer. That dares try to grow inside you.
Thank god. Are you all right?<eos> Perfect excuse not to quit drinking?<eos> This is our fault.<eos> We put you in the crosshairs.<eos> We never should have made you the public face.
I was just, um...<eos> Organizing all my stuff here.<eos> Then I realized...<eos> I don't have any stuff.<eos> This thing with you and amos...
I think.<eos> You're...<eos> Kind of like his guide star, right?<eos> Lighting the way, and all, through the dark.<eos> Like julie is to you.
You're...<eos> Kind of like his guide star, right?<eos> Lighting the way, and all, through the dark.<eos> Like julie is to you.<eos> How long, you and her?
You okay there?<eos> I think all that radiation failed to give me superpowers.<eos> Usually, when we're in dangerous situations, You hide your nerves. By asking weird, inappropriate questions.<eos> Do I?<eos> I hope that hasn't been irradiated out of you.
We could've filled the roci with people, but we didn't.<eos> What the hell does that say about us?<eos> You can talk all day long about, You know, looking out for yourself...<eos> Minding your own business, just trying to survive.<eos> It all boils down to an excuse, And that excuse ain't worth a good goddamn. When the world is burning down around you.
I'm talking about all of you.<eos> Being caught up in this...<eos> Alex wants to do something.<eos> Amos doesn't do anything he doesn't want to.<eos> And if you think I'm going along just because of you...
Keep licking the earther's hand, Maybe he toss you a few more scrap from his table.<eos> It's not news to me that black sky. Resents my position here.<eos> But trust me, Now is not the time for factions or debate.<eos> There's opa. And there is opa.<eos> You?
You're still talking.<eos> If another belter ship don't see the blast. And come for me, I still be on the float.<eos> All this just bonus time for me, sasa ke?<eos> Stick next to me, okay?<eos> I'll look out for you when we land.
All this just bonus time for me, sasa ke?<eos> Stick next to me, okay?<eos> I'll look out for you when we land.<eos> Oy, pampa.<eos> I keep an eye on you, old man.
Everybody stay here.<eos> Nobody move.<eos> All right, turn it off, dirtbag!<eos> Now is the time for all good men to come. To the aid of their species.<eos> You.
- Should I call Max to--<eos> - I don't need a babysitter.<eos> Fine.<eos> Reda?<eos> I need you in the office now.
Alaikum salaam.<eos> When do I go home?<eos> We'll get to that, but first, we need to talk about something I thought we went over last time.<eos> Everything we say in here is privileged.<eos> No one can use it against you, but you got to be honest with us.
This is kind of everything in the canned department.<eos> I could warm up the soup if you want.<eos> And you need to take two of these every eight hours.<eos> Something down here doesn't smell very good.<eos> I think it might be you.

The Israelis are gonna pick him up.<eos> Pick him up?<eos> Ask him about his travels.<eos> Tell me this, Dar.<eos> Off the record, just you and me.
Pick him up?<eos> Ask him about his travels.<eos> Tell me this, Dar.<eos> Off the record, just you and me.<eos> Does that sound like a solid intelligence-gathering effort to you, or does that sound like a way to provoke a crisis with Iran we inherit on inauguration day?
Let a jury decide how certain they are he's not gonna pick up an AR-15 and shoot them all in their sleep?<eos> Look, if you want to believe the kid's a saint, go ahead.<eos> You go anywhere near Saad Mahsud,<eos> I will have you arrested.<eos> It was nice talking to you.
It's so good.<eos> And I'm sorry I missed you tonight.<eos> But I'll see you tomorrow.<eos> Cross my heart.<eos> Hey. Thought that might be you.
How was yours?<eos> What happened to me?<eos> Apparently, you had a seizure.<eos> No, before that.<eos> Uh, you got into an altercation at the hospital yesterday, and we agreed it might be a good idea for you to come live here for a little while.
Over, over, and over again.<eos> Looking for some clue.<eos> There. It was those tiles.<eos> Those are what...<eos> what led me to you.
We didn't start anything "together."<eos> You put a gun to my head and threatened to expose me to my own service.<eos> I went along because I had no choice.<eos> Do you remember that?<eos> - Is that how you see it? - That's how it was.
- Please, I insist.<eos> Dorit. Nice to see you again.<eos> And what a treat, Saul coming to visit you at long last.<eos> - But so sad he has to leave so soon.<eos> He's an important man, like you.
Okay, we'll do it your way.<eos> There were reports last night of a senior Rev Guard officer crossing the Jordanian border.<eos> Impossible.<eos> No ranking Iranian would take a risk like that.<eos> Yet there he was, in the West Bank, at the same time as you.
I was visiting my sister.<eos> Whom you haven't seen in more than a decade, and who gets the pleasure of your company for less than a day.<eos> Because I have to get back to the States.<eos> I'm on the transition team.<eos> I'm afraid the President-elect will have to do without you for a while.
Listen, if I knew for a fact Iran was close to a nuclear weapon, I'd tell you.<eos> Define "close." Is ten years too close?<eos> Because best case scenario, Iran has a bomb in ten years.<eos> A lot can happen between now and then.<eos> I live here, Saul. You don't.
I got my rent to cover. I got car payments.<eos> I want the truth.<eos> You think you can find that somewhere in that head of yours?<eos> He looks like government, man.<eos> He looks like you.
It took me an hour to get out here on that stinking train.<eos> Why not just meet at the Rezidentura?<eos> Viktor.<eos> L'chaim.<eos> There were whispers all last year about you.
Trouble in Berlin.<eos> I expected to hear from you.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Now you have.<eos> I didn't say I wanted to hear from you.
-He confirmed it.<eos> That guy in the photo you sent me?<eos> Not an associate of Sekou Bah.<eos> I ran his photo through NGI.<eos> They came up empty, just like you.
Now it's my turn to say "no."<eos> The question is... what do we do now?<eos> -We?<eos> -Yes.<eos> This puts us in a bad situation... you and me.
What's she make of it?<eos> The bombing?<eos> I'd say she's still processing.<eos> You could tell, though, she's... not chastened, exactly, but a little more open.<eos> Open to you.
A bomb has been planted.<eos> An FBI agent is dead.<eos> I-I don't know who these people are, but they are serious.<eos> And they're connected.<eos> I'm worried about you.
What deal?<eos> The deal Dar Adal made.<eos> Right now, you're an important national-security asset.<eos> Break the terms, and you're a national-security risk.<eos> Do I like a f-fucking risk to you?
Feeling sorry for yourself?<eos> Go fuck yourself, Dar.<eos> Because if you are, that would be a first.<eos> You grew up in a hard school, no time for self-pity.<eos> It's the first thing about you that impressed.
Fair enough.<eos> For the record, though, I... I never forced myself on anyone.<eos> I'm not staying here.<eos> Yes, you are.<eos> Astrid will look after you till you can look after yourself.
Why don't you just put me in a fuckin'...<eos> Collar.<eos> Collar!<eos> Thank you.<eos> What's so important you have to get back to New York?
What's so important you have to get back to New York?<eos> Astrid mentioned on the phone you were talking about the attack.<eos> The bomb that went off...<eos> Why are you so interested?<eos> What's it to you?
It's Carrie Mathison.<eos> Her foundation represented the bomber.<eos> She's what's pulling you back to New York, isn't that it?<eos> No.<eos> The sway she holds over you... and Saul,
She was wrong.<eos> W-What risks?<eos> The main one was massive cerebral hemorrhage.<eos> Stroke.<eos> You think she's been taking care of you all these months out of love?
- NavyWife.<eos> That's me, too.<eos> DeltaForceGroupie. - Yo.<eos> So we're back in business?<eos> You tell me.
Yeah, right.<eos> No, I...<eos> I know you.<eos> Johnny?<eos> Is that you?
I mean, if there is ever anything I can--<eos> I said I'm fine.<eos> It was really great seeing you again.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Uh, yeah, you too.
You were always curious about my work.<eos> Well, this is called paper-chasing.<eos> Please pay the bill and leave the cafe immediately, turning right and onto 77th Street.<eos> Midway down the block, cross the street."<eos> "At the corner of Central Park West, a silver Range Rover will pull up beside you."
- Counterintelligence.<eos> They'll find you.<eos> They always do.<eos> Not if you don't tell them where I am.<eos> If I can get to Athens-- And I think I can-- only you and Father Matsoukis know about the rectory.
The intelligence community hates her.<eos> And you're caught in the middle.<eos> I must say I'm impressed.<eos> Don't be-<eos> - I was married to you for 27 years.
- What?<eos> You'll go to prison?<eos> Probably cut a deal.<eos> But I'll be humiliated-- publicly.<eos> When has that ever made the slightest bit of fucking difference to you?
You're still out there going a million miles an hour.<eos> You will hit a wall.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Damn it.<eos> I'm worried about you.
And why is that, Frank?<eos> Why do you think our new President's son lost more men than any other commander during the surge?<eos> 'Cause Andrew Keane only cared about his career and the ribbons that he had pinned on his chest. And he didn't give a shit what he had to do to get them.<eos> - He must have taken...<eos> Rudy. You're late. Brett had to start without you.
- No, you keep it. - No.<eos> - All that footage you gave us. You already earned it.<eos> But you can't let us down. I'm...<eos> Look at those guys over there. Look.<eos> They are here because of you, because you had the guts to speak out.
Dog.<eos> Depression.<eos> She hasn't come out of Franny's room.<eos> Been in there since last night.<eos> Hey, you.
You punched me.<eos> That was bad, I admit.<eos> Hey. Hey, don't go!<eos> Please.<eos> I need you.
It's good.<eos> I just got off the phone with George Pallis, the solicitor general.<eos> He's excited about the van.<eos> Law enforcement's already on the way.<eos> Plus, he's coming personally to handle the immunity situation with you.
I thought it would be better in person.<eos> You want to talk about it?<eos> We should.<eos> I don't even mean the immunity part.<eos> I mean, you know, what's going on with you.
You're gonna get out of this.<eos> We both are.<eos> What are you looking at?<eos> You want to tell me?<eos> What do these letters look like to you?
Let's go, let's go!<eos> Stay with me, Grace.<eos> All right, honey?<eos> Listen to my voice.<eos> We're gonna take good care of you.
That's why it's so funny.<eos> "February 7, 2014."<eos> "Rival gang members open fire in a busy commuter walkway."<eos> I know, and almost killed Charlie and I in the process.<eos> Alex, you and Grace were at the same random shootings two years apart.
I fled to Alfred, the Saxon king of Wessex.<eos> I fell in love with a pagan queen, who saw my sister in a vision.<eos> Uhtred, she lives, and is being held in the North.<eos> In the year 878 at Ethandune, I fought alongside King Alfred to defeat the Danes, and drove them from Wessex, but at a great price.<eos> Uhtred Ragnarson, I have a gift for you.
Morning, Lord.<eos> She did the very same thing to me.<eos> - We're leaving. - Argh!<eos> Could you not have shook me awake?<eos> It's time for you to stop drinking and whoring
- No more word, I'm warning you!<eos> - Leave now.<eos> - What?<eos> Go.<eos> You!
- Leave now.<eos> - What?<eos> Go.<eos> You!<eos> You!
I'd prefer you not to look at me, Lord.<eos> Is it wrong that I look?<eos> You have beauty.<eos> And you have an appetite I do not wish to satisfy.<eos> I'm with you, Lord, because I'm safe with you.
One of my best.<eos> You like him?<eos> He's very strong.<eos> Very young.<eos> Something for you, huh?
You will never change!<eos> - You cannot change!<eos> - Lord!<eos> Lord, I beg you.<eos> That he fears you is enough.
That he fears you is enough.<eos> Let him take that fear to Kjartan.<eos> May we free the prisoners, Lord, search the pens for a friend, the king?<eos> You may.<eos> I have no business with you.
A ransom was not paid, it goes back to the church.<eos> Some coins should go to them, the lepers.<eos> Without them, we'd all be dead.<eos> As I am apparently now a king, I shall see they are rewarded.<eos> This is for you.
Go shut her up!<eos> Your bitch!<eos> It did not appear to be a trick.<eos> Everything I've said is true.<eos> You, Fiske... do you believe this horseman is back from the dead?
He will have men hump you.<eos> I tell you every time... you do not need to live like this.<eos> You don't need to eat and sleep with hounds.<eos> It is my wish.<eos> I dream of you... as you were.
I got a tattoo.<eos> A couple hundred more and I'll catch up with you.<eos> Let's have a baby.<eos> What?<eos> I wanna have a baby with you.
Fucking alcoholic.<eos> I know what you're trying to do, but it's not gonna work!<eos> You can't stop me, asshole!<eos> Kevin Garvey Jr. Reporting.<eos> Buddy, I know you're my totem, but. I got some bad news for you.
You're building a boat.<eos> For the flood.<eos> I need to get to the hospital in Kurripa.<eos> Any chance you guys could give me a ride there?<eos> Lady of the house will take better care of you than the hospital.
You're the fella that landed on him.<eos> He's dead.<eos> He's dead?<eos> "Caleb's arthritis."<eos> You Caleb?
Another one bites the dust.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Everything go okay?<eos> Yeah, absolutely.<eos> - You?
You gonna look your dad up?<eos> - Look him up?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I thought that's why you wanted to come down here.<eos> No, I came down here to be with you.
And if he wanted me to know, he would've fucking told me.<eos> Gotcha.<eos> You brought your book.<eos> It's not my book. It's Matt's.<eos> But it's about you.
Yeah. Nora had to come here for work.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> She's here.<eos> She's here. I talked to her, Laurie.<eos> I just... I need you to slow down and explain to me exactly what you think you saw.
- He's where?<eos> - Just give me... give me a minute.<eos> - Kevin?<eos> - What the fuck did you do?<eos> Okay. I just... I need you to calm down and just tell me what happened.
I need you to... to leave and go back to the hotel, okay?<eos> Go back to Nora and call me later, okay?<eos> She told me that you said that I was ill.<eos> What the fuck does that mean, Laurie? !<eos> Remember when you were seeing Patti and I told you that...
I don't understand what's happening.<eos> I think that you projected Evie onto a stranger.<eos> And I think you chose Evie because... you understood why she did what she did.<eos> Why she left her family. Why she escaped.<eos> I think a part of you wants to escape, Kevin.
It is less than a week away from the seventh anniversary and you just ran away without telling anybody.<eos> No, I... I came to be with Nora.<eos> She's the one that needed to be here.<eos> I... she's the one that ran away.<eos> Kevin, are you and Nora okay?
Right?<eos> Right.<eos> Then let's get on the plane and work this out like civilized adults.<eos> When we find Kevin, you don't speak to him, okay?<eos> I will talk to him. He didn't call you.
To-- to guide them.<eos> To ease their suffering even though I suffered myself.<eos> I sacrificed my happiness.<eos> - I let my family abandon me.<eos> - Why? For you!
- What happened?<eos> - Dog bit me.<eos> I'm fine. Just a little rabies.<eos> - Is it them?<eos> - You tell me.
Truth is, along with our missing fucking savior, we also appear to be short some apostles.<eos> Our friend Matthew conspicuously absent.<eos> Fortunately, I will play the part of Peter.<eos> You are already John.<eos> What about you, kid? You wanna be Simon, Bartholomew?
You, Dr. Garvey, are one apostle, and one apostle only.<eos> Thomas.<eos> Doubting Thomas.<eos> When I first started hearing voices back in Mapleton, everyone around me told me I was fucking nuts.<eos> Everyone. Except you.
It was just a phase. I forgive you.<eos> So, hey, Tommy said Dad and Nora went to Australia?<eos> I tried calling them. What's up with that?<eos> Who knows?<eos> What are you doing right now? Where are you?
Because Matt's gonna wanna bury me next to Mom and Dad in the old Jamison plot about a mile from here.<eos> - He's gonna put up a fight.<eos> If you wanna be cremated, I'll make sure you're cremated.<eos> We'll burn you up good.<eos> What about you?
Get him off, God damn it!<eos> Stop!<eos> Stop!<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - What are you doing?
Looks like rain.<eos> Do you know who I am?<eos> Do you know that I'm not the President of the United States?<eos> I sure do.<eos> I have a message for you from your father.
Is there anything you want me to tell him?<eos> Are you fucking serious?<eos> My father was murdered... my mother, my brother... all of them gone in an instant because of a drone strike ordered by your administration.<eos> No. N-no, that's not what happened.<eos> You were killed.
I don't wanna do this anymore.<eos> Do what, Mr. President? Stop fucking calling me that!<eos> I'm not the president! You're not the fucking Secretary of Defense.<eos> Oh, yes, yes, I am.<eos> You named me Secretary of Defense.
♪ Different as night and day. ♪<eos> All right, gentlemen.<eos> Let's get to the hard part, shall we?<eos> I, Patricia Levin, in my capacity as Secretary of Defense hereby invoke the Fisher Protocol, overriding the Heart Deterrent pursuant to the nuclear command authority granted by Article Two, Section Two of the US Constitution.<eos> The president shall make an incision two inches below the sternum of the volunteer... that's you... whereupon the president, gaining access from beneath the ribcage, shall manually extract the launch key from behind the left atrium.
No! Why the fuck would I volunteer to be cut open?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Why would you?<eos> - I wouldn't! - And yet here you are.<eos> Knowing full well what is inside of you, you kept moving forward towards this very room and the one person powerful enough to take it out.
Well, I'm sorry it's come to this, but I have no choice.<eos> I received a call from the CIA that the president was keeping a secret journal hidden behind the portrait of Millard Fillmore in the Oval.<eos> As this was clearly a national security issue, I had no choice but to procure it.<eos> I'd like you to read this for us.<eos> What about you?
And, so, I found out where you lived.<eos> And here you are.<eos> - That's not what happened.<eos> You showed a picture of me to the nun at the convent. That's how you found out where I lived.<eos> Why would I have a picture of you?
Did you tell him where I was, Laurie?<eos> No. No, I didn't.<eos> - Because if you did, just say so, and I...<eos> We established boundaries the first time you called me. Clear boundaries.<eos> I don't tell you about the people here, and I don't tell the people here about you.
About a year old now.<eos> And I'm a fucking grandpa.<eos> Tommy's marriage didn't work out so great.<eos> But he landed on his feet, like he always does.<eos> - What about you?
They just cut me open, put in a pacemaker.<eos> - Yeah, really.<eos> Wanna see my scar?<eos> You said she wouldn't come.<eos> I'm just as surprised as you are.
And everybody here knows I've made my fair share of mistakes, but there is a very big difference between a sin and a mistake.<eos> Because a mistake is just fucking up?<eos> But a sin... hoohoo.<eos> A sin is when you know something is wrong and you do it anyway.<eos> So, Aggie, my darling wife, my sun and my stars, I look forward to a lifetime of fucking up with you.
And I told him it's because I didn't belong there.<eos> So, he built it.<eos> And I came back through.<eos> I came back here.<eos> Did I... think about you?
I am a star!<eos> Wait, you played the lead part?<eos> What happened to Dionne Warwick?<eos> Nothing, she's fine!<eos> I think I know more about Dionne Warwick than you do!
I miss you so much, Russ.<eos> Why do you have to go to Africa and fight rhino poaching anyway?<eos> Who cares how rhinos are cooked?<eos> When he gets back, let's go on a double date.<eos> You, Russ, me, and someone we trick.
What?<eos> No. Who's this?<eos> You leave phone in cab!<eos> I am SoHo.<eos> Where you?
And I'm making it worse.<eos> I bet your cell's pretty small. My apartment's so big, I can-<eos> - Gosh dang it!<eos> Why don't our shins have butts?<eos> I know it seems like you're just having fun, but you let someone back in your life who's-- who's bad for you.
It's holding you back.<eos> Who, me?<eos> No, that's not what's happening here.<eos> 'Cause it's different than it used to be.<eos> Not everything's about you, dear.
Because I'm the one who's acted completely out of bounds?<eos> The Ranger squad that killed Bin-Khalid was attacked this morning.<eos> Four of them were murdered and their families.<eos> What are...<eos> The Rangers were living under new identities that only three people had access to, the directors of CIA, NSA... and you.
I'm out of here as soon as I get a location on the Dominican deal, but, uh, I'll leave a man behind to watch you, and Aisha can get you whatever you need.<eos> Aisha doesn't seem too happy I'm here.<eos> Well, me and Aisha have been having problems for a while.<eos> Yeah, well, maybe I'm making things worse.<eos> Nah. It's not you.
With Aisha, nothing's ever enough for her.<eos> She helped set up this deal but as soon it's done, me and Aisha, we through.<eos> What you looking for?<eos> Won't know till I see it.<eos> I know what you want... because you and me, we want the same thing.
Isaac. Why are you worrying about Isaac?<eos> He treats you like a little bitch.<eos> He is still running things.<eos> What if he wasn't?<eos> What if I said, I got a way for you to get what's yours?
We're not going to stay and wait for the Americans to find us.<eos> If we don't act now, we'll achieve nothing.<eos> - You're coming with us.<eos> - I'm not going anywhere.<eos> And neither are you.
Hey. What's wrong?<eos> Hey. Look at me.<eos> You have to finish mixing the explosives.<eos> Have you forgotten what these people did to you?<eos> What they said about you with those other students?
- Locke signed in downstairs. He was just bumped up to head of field ops.<eos> He has a debrief scheduled with Mullins.<eos> - You'll have to stall him.<eos> - Me?<eos> I don't work here anymore, Andy, it has to be you.
I've been trying to reach him for the last 45 minutes.<eos> Ben.<eos> - Where are you? - I need more time.<eos> Right, so CTU can track me.<eos> So I can get the list and you can get the money.
Did Drew believe it?<eos> I knew you were lying to me.<eos> He was the one you were texting?<eos> !<eos> I was beginning to think this was gonna happen without you.
- She's my brother's wife.<eos> Like that would stop you starting up with her again.<eos> Don't get crazy.<eos> Money ain't coming in like it was.<eos> That's why I reached out to you in the first place, put this deal together.
She's explained everything.<eos> She's on the line for you.<eos> Rebecca? Thank God.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> You tell me.
Ben is counter-surveillance trained, okay?<eos> He's also very paranoid.<eos> Carter, Grimes has already gotten away from you once.<eos> We can't let that happen again.<eos> Eric, you and I were operating alone because we didn't know who we could trust.
I want to be the one to bring her in.<eos> I keep having to remind you, you don't work here anymore.<eos> She's my husband's campaign manager.<eos> Keith, it would be easier for John if I do this.<eos> Take Agent Fox with you.
No, Isaac can take care of hisself. He is looking out for me.<eos> Okay, listen, if... if you can get her number and tell me when she made that call, CTU might be able to pull up a transcript or some kind of recording, okay?<eos> They can do that?<eos> They can do a lot of stuff I didn't know they could.<eos> Just make sure you tap into all those surveillance cameras, okay?
But I can't find it.<eos> That's because NSA hasn't captured it yet from the phone company servers.<eos> But, look, if we go into the system directly and I.D. the cell tower that handled the call...<eos> See?<eos> So, um, what's going on with you and Locke?
I'm on the train.<eos> Where are you, Ben?<eos> Where are you?<eos> Right here.<eos> But you're staying right there.
This is Aisha.<eos> What's happening?<eos> Just waiting on your boy.<eos> Shouldn't he have been there by now?<eos> You tell me.
Yeah, you do that.<eos> Rebecca. Good to see you, Eric.<eos> Got to say, this is a little different from that bunker in Yemen.<eos> This is national CTU headquarters, the nerve center.<eos> I remember you from Taiz.
A couple of times.<eos> Well, probably more like three, but who's counting, right?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I never had the chance to say how sorry I am, about the men.<eos> I know they were like brothers to you.
What, you already went through them?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I tweaked some parameters, so you're good to go.<eos> Can thank me later.<eos> I know you think Mullins is looking to get rid of you.
I tweaked some parameters, so you're good to go.<eos> Can thank me later.<eos> I know you think Mullins is looking to get rid of you.<eos> How do you know what I think?<eos> Because whatever's on your mind hangs on you like a sign.
That all of this was for nothing?<eos> I'll do everything I can.<eos> I laid eyes today on the man who killed my father.<eos> It's a sign we're on a righteous path.<eos> You'll fix that drive.
Um, no one knows.<eos> They found him lying by the soccer field.<eos> I'm so glad you're here.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> He really cares about you.
Do not accept them as your friend and your ally!<eos> The prophet Muhammad had Christians and Jews as his allies.<eos> Ben and I would go in together.<eos> If we make contact with Gabriel, we'll see if he knows how to find Jadalla bin-Khalid.<eos> Why limit the operation to you and grimes?
Agent Wilkes will take you to debrief. Mullins.<eos> Are you hearing what you want to hear from grimes, convincing yourself you can trust him?<eos> Why would I do that?<eos> Because you blame yourself for what happened today.<eos> I told you and Mullins what I think.
Why would I do that?<eos> Because you blame yourself for what happened today.<eos> I told you and Mullins what I think.<eos> And right now, I don't see any other option.<eos> Do you?
But, yeah, counterfeit.<eos> But the fact remains that those rangers' names were stolen from our campaign headquarters.<eos> That much is still true.<eos> As is the fact that, uh, there was only three people that had access to that particular account:<eos> Me, Rebecca and you.
John, stop it. Information from my friend...<eos> Think about what you're doing, now.<eos> Don't you realize...<eos> At the NSA, to see if CTU...<eos> I did it for you.
Dad.<eos> Dad.<eos> I beg you, please.<eos> Don't throw away everything that we have worked for your whole life!<eos> I was just coming to talk to you and your father about campaign managers.
How?<eos> I told him everything.<eos> You'll deny it.<eos> Unless he was wearing a wire...<eos> There is no hard evidence linking you or me to anything.
People inside the campaign were already whispering about me before the Gage ad.<eos> Now they'll never stop.<eos> My reputation's destroyed.<eos> How do I go back to my job now?<eos> How do I just go back to my life, knowing what you and John really think of me?
I want your team ready to intercept once we locate Carter and Grimes.<eos> It's him.<eos> Put him on speaker.<eos> Eric, I'm here with Keith Mullins.<eos> Turn around now before this gets any worse for you.
Keep working.<eos> I know that was hard, Amira.<eos> But you had to do it.<eos> You had no choice.<eos> You and I are going to be part of something greater than ourselves.
I'm happy to see you, too.<eos> Khasan, how are you, son?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I'm just here on business.<eos> And you?
Look.<eos> I'm asking you to talk to him.<eos> And say what?<eos> I've never seen him like this before.<eos> That's 'cause he wasn't like this when you and Eric were around.
That's 'cause he wasn't like this when you and Eric were around.<eos> Once you two bounced, everything changed.<eos> I know Eric leaving was rough for him.<eos> It wasn't Eric.<eos> It was you leaving that broke him.
Is that kharcho?<eos> It smells just like your mother's.<eos> Always reminds me of home.<eos> Mmm. So good.<eos> And what about you?
Tell me what you two have done.<eos> Fine.<eos> You don't want to talk, then pack your bags...<eos> You're coming home with me.<eos> You, too, boy.
Let's do this.<eos> You got some balls coming back here again.<eos> I got business.<eos> Something for Gabriel.<eos> You think he's gonna do business with you again?
But you're losing them.<eos> You're out of control.<eos> You'll end up making them do something they'd never think of doing.<eos> Like what?<eos> If you keep going like this... they're gonna turn on you.
- Excuse me.<eos> Come on.<eos> Look, I mean it, all right?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I put my hands on you.
And I'm glad you let her go.<eos> I didn't want to kill Aisha,<eos> - not really.<eos> - Yeah, well, I'm glad that worked out<eos> - for you.
So, what, he's waiting for you now?<eos> He's not quite finished yet.<eos> Right.<eos> So, um... look, why don't you stay here?<eos> Let me make it up to you.
So, um... look, why don't you stay here?<eos> Let me make it up to you.<eos> At least till your man's done saving the world.<eos> You see how things are.<eos> I need you.
An operation Eric Carter is running has turned up a promising lead.<eos> We may be able to find Jadalla without your father's help.<eos> CTU is launching an operation.<eos> Keith's asked if I'll oversee it with him.<eos> I don't know if it's you that can't do without this place, or them who can't do without you.
It's not an option.<eos> You don't have to be afraid of your brother anymore, you've done more than enough for him.<eos> He'll just have to understand.<eos> Harris.<eos> I need you here.
I don't die a martyr.<eos> Khasan, I can't do this by myself.<eos> Khasan. You're all right.<eos> Come here.<eos> God is with you, little sister.
Is that what it would take to get you to stay, hmm?<eos> This is the only thing I know how to do.<eos> You don't know what you can do until you try.<eos> You're smart, Isaac.<eos> You know, I got faith in you. Yeah.
You can't do this.<eos> I already told you, Papa.<eos> I'm going to teach the infidels a lesson.<eos> Infidels?<eos> That's not you talking, that's your brother.
I already told you, Papa.<eos> I'm going to teach the infidels a lesson.<eos> Infidels?<eos> That's not you talking, that's your brother.<eos> He was always the angry one. Not you.
Find someone who can.<eos> And bring them to us.<eos> You let my wife go, and then we'll talk.<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> I'm not negotiating with you.
Which seems...<eos> I don't know... Like a waste of a perfectly good virus.<eos> Andy, you talk a lot when you're stressed.<eos> Look, you'll figure it out.<eos> I have faith in you, man.
You got three seconds.<eos> What the hell are you doing here?<eos> You left CTU with your laptop and your development kit in the middle of a terrorist event.<eos> That's not normal behavior.<eos> Even for you.
Tell me where Nicole at.<eos> Where's Nicole?<eos> Isaac.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Isaac. I was worried about you.
All right?<eos> Nicole, I love you.<eos> I always have.<eos> Always will.<eos> Andy... remember, be sure Jadalla believes I'm forcing you to do this.
- No.<eos> No, Eric.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - No! Get her to CTU.<eos> Isaac'll take care of you.
You're going to walk my friend through every program you have on this laptop.<eos> You understand?<eos> Isaac, we have to go back.<eos> Try to help Eric.<eos> Eric told me to take care of you, so that's what I'm doing.
Maybe you want him gone.<eos> Why would you say something crazy like that?<eos> Because I've never known you to run.<eos> And that's what you're doing, you're turning your back on your brother.<eos> You know if you ever needed him, he would be there for you.
Why would you say something crazy like that?<eos> Because I've never known you to run.<eos> And that's what you're doing, you're turning your back on your brother.<eos> You know if you ever needed him, he would be there for you.<eos> No matter what Eric had to do, he would be there for you.
I followed Carter's truck to the exchange site where Jadalla transferred him and Andy into a van, but I'm having trouble following the van.<eos> They're using overpasses for cover.<eos> Keep looking.<eos> You guys close?<eos> You and Andy?
- Mariana...<eos> - It's Andy.<eos> - Andy?<eos> You need to get out of there, now, Andy.<eos> You and Carter.
It's not like that, John.<eos> I look at you and I don't even know who you are anymore.<eos> We have to go back.<eos> Try to help Eric.<eos> Eric told me to take care of you, so that's what I'm doing.
And I love you for that.<eos> I do.<eos> I got to go, man.<eos> Going after this man...<eos> It has to be you?
All right, well, we'll break down here.<eos> It'll be like we were never here.<eos> Okay.<eos> Rebecca?<eos> I hope things work out between you and John.
I mean, if anybody understands that sometimes short-term compromises have to be made for the greater good...<eos> - You're serious.<eos> - ...it's Rebecca.<eos> She understands that sort of thing.<eos> There were over a hundred innocent people that were killed on that bridge because of you.
Baby, you're not happy.<eos> Nicole.<eos> You need this.<eos> You always will.<eos> No, listen, even if that was true it doesn't mean I, I don't need you, baby, because I do.
You came here to get an answer from Eric.<eos> You got your answer.<eos> I don't like seeing you like this.<eos> Look at me.<eos> When you and Eric walked out on me, one thought kept me going.
Maybe it hasn't worked out that way.<eos> What I'm trying to say...<eos> It's looking like I'm gonna be starting over and... if you feel like you might need to start over, too...<eos> You don't have to answer now.<eos> You and Eric got some talking to do.
Step out of the vehicle with your hands raised.<eos> On your knees.<eos> I said on your knees.<eos> Drop it.<eos> You, too, now.
- We've only got a few minutes.<eos> - We're not far.<eos> You drive ahead,<eos> I'll follow on foot.<eos> I'll only be a few minutes behind you,
Yeah, same one.<eos> I'm still locked out.<eos> Director of National Intelligence.<eos> I'm at the location.<eos> Right behind you.
Without the girl, this never happened.<eos> Get ready.<eos> Hold it!<eos> Where's the girl?<eos> I'm gonna find the girl with or without you.
Director Mullins.<eos> Okay, go see Mr. Hammad.<eos> Hello, Ara.<eos> I'm Mr. Hammad.<eos> I'm gonna take care of you until your mother arrives.
_<eos> Naseri?<eos> She's safe.<eos> Start walking.<eos> When I tell you, hit the ground.
Rebecca's ambulance is exiting 29.<eos> - What are you working on?<eos> - Signal lights.<eos> I want that ambulance to hit green all the way through.<eos> What Nicole said... that there's something inside you that... scares her?
Those soldiers... and all the people on that bridge... and now Rebecca...<eos> They're all dead because of me.<eos> One little lie led to a bigger lie and a bigger lie and... I trapped myself in all these lies.<eos> But there is one thing that's true now as it ever was.<eos> This country needs you.
Um, he-he had to go.<eos> He, um, he said he just needed some time alone.<eos> He's going through a lot right now.<eos> Yeah, I guess so.<eos> I wasn't being honest with you.
I don't... just... okay.<eos> He was kind of a miserable guy and, you know, he took it out on his wife and his kids and everybody including me, so I said fuck it, I just got up there and told it like it was.<eos> It was fucking hilarious.<eos> So...<eos> Were you born an asshole, Gary?
Look, you're gonna be fine.<eos> Your dad was a stand up guy.<eos> Yeah, but how do you condense a man's entire life into five minutes?<eos> There's probably an app for that, right?<eos> You, like, download a template, put in his name and then boom, it writes it for you?
You raised a good kid.<eos> I'm surprised he found the time.<eos> - You didn't know he visited pops?<eos> - Sure, I knew. I just didn't think he visited him that often.<eos> You sure didn't.
A weekend away? We're talking serious risk.<eos> Right. I know, but I think I'll lose him if I don't go.<eos> And that doesn't set off warning bells?<eos> Okay, I got it. You don't think I should go.<eos> Honey, listen to me. Right now you and Ted have a thing.
- Actually coffee sounds good.<eos> - Okay. Give me a hand?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, my God. That was...<eos> - Are you okay?
I revered you.<eos> When you were told that my mother and I were dead, I have to believe that it affected you.<eos> You had just lost your mother.<eos> But if things were as I remember, my mother and I were your family, too.<eos> And yet, through all the years thereafter that my father cared for you... counseled you, labored for you... he never told you that we were alive.
I did not want this.<eos> Flint is my friend, but I know what he is.<eos> I have no illusions about it.<eos> But for all the dangers he presents, for all his offenses... the one thing he's never done is force me to choose between him and you.<eos> That, you did.
You coming?<eos> I won't ask again.<eos> Keeping an eye on us?<eos> Making sure you don't slit my throat out of spite, perhaps.<eos> I suppose I chose the right hostage if they're that concerned about keeping you alive.
Keeping an eye on us?<eos> Making sure you don't slit my throat out of spite, perhaps.<eos> I suppose I chose the right hostage if they're that concerned about keeping you alive.<eos> I suppose so.<eos> You know, there was a time... not so long ago, when you shared their concern.
If I apologize, you will know it is a lie.<eos> And I do not wish to lie to you ever again.<eos> Leave.<eos> No.<eos> I am going to stay with you.
And I do not wish to lie to you ever again.<eos> Leave.<eos> No.<eos> I am going to stay with you.<eos> I want to take care of you.
We, uh, follow Flint south... to the camp.<eos> We'll regroup, we'll refit, we'll...<eos> A war against civilization?<eos> What?<eos> Civilization has been winning that war for 10,000 years against men richer, braver, stronger, and smarter than you.
Just now, that man and several others wondered aloud whether the smartest thing to do wouldn't be killing you and throwing you in the sea rather than giving you another opportunity to fuck us!<eos> For reasons I can't begin to fathom, I argued against it.<eos> Bark at me again about braver, stronger, and smarter men, and I might decide to revisit the issue!<eos> If killing me seems like the smartest thing to do, then it is obvious to me none of you have any idea how to defeat Woodes Rogers.<eos> - And you do? !
Most people suck.<eos> They pretend, lie.<eos> They do anything to manipulate and control the situation around them.<eos> In a world such as this, the most precious thing a man can find is loyalty.<eos> I know how loyal you are to your friend and how loyal he is to you.
UK outlet.<eos> Same in Singapore, but I haven't felt air conditioning once.<eos> Impressive.<eos> Even for a Chicago cop.<eos> However, what your keen powers of observation have failed to glean... is that what we do is older than you and older than me... and the people on my side know what it is.
I think that the fact we could all fit in the tub... means it must be ours.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Who is it?<eos> It's me.<eos> You...
- Sure.<eos> Why bathrooms?<eos> How are you?<eos> Fine.<eos> You?
Wolfgang...<eos> Hello, sexy.<eos> [Kala] Wolfgang?<eos> What if I don't want to be happy?<eos> Is someone with you?
I wouldn't be alive if you hadn't helped me.<eos> Those men who attacked you, they were hired by your brother?<eos> Good.<eos> Why good?<eos> Because... he must be very afraid of you to do something like that.
Why good?<eos> Because... he must be very afraid of you to do something like that.<eos> I'm sure when he hears you have escaped, he's going to piss himself.<eos> I have met strong women before.<eos> But... none of them were like you.
Did something else happen?<eos> Something's always happening.<eos> Something happened to the cluster?<eos> There was a protest in India, a riot over water in Nairobi.<eos> But mostly I was just worried about you.
When was the last time you spoke to Raoul?<eos> I believe he called me just before he vanished.<eos> Yes?<eos> Raoul?<eos> Raoul, is it you?
- No.<eos> - I will only slow you down.<eos> Besides, what else can they do to me?<eos> I'm serving life.<eos> I need you.
I'm serving life.<eos> I need you.<eos> Go.<eos> Go clear your name.<eos> You and your imaginary friends.
[Angelica] I don't want to waste any more time listening to your excuses.<eos> Fuck.<eos> That's it!<eos> I'm done.<eos> I'm done with you, I am done with them.
I've never dated anyone who owned so many books.<eos> I've never dated anyone who drove a matatu.<eos> We do live in different worlds.<eos> Not tonight we don't.<eos> When I'm with you... all the rules... and the logic of everyday life... things that were so important to me... all go away.
I've never dated anyone who drove a matatu.<eos> We do live in different worlds.<eos> Not tonight we don't.<eos> When I'm with you... all the rules... and the logic of everyday life... things that were so important to me... all go away.<eos> And all I feel... is how fast my heart beats... whenever I'm with you.
I've interviewed Koman Nyagah.<eos> He's a serious and very intelligent man.<eos> Why wouldn't you meet with him?<eos> Zakia, I'm a matatu driver.<eos> Which is exactly why you should run and why people would vote for you.
- Must've been on blockers when we met.<eos> Ding.<eos> Bowling ball continues to impress.<eos> Hey, ask him how he avoids BPO.<eos> Ask him if you and I can have just a quick fuck.
These are the last year reports from the controller general. Yeah, you can just put them there.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - You're welcome.<eos> About last night...<eos> I... needed you and you were there for me.
What did Dad say?<eos> He said I would regret it.<eos> But why?<eos> I can take it.<eos> Because he said that your narcissism is a black hole and that you would do something to make my wedding all about you.
Is this one of yours?<eos> Yeah.<eos> He thought you were as hot as I do.<eos> But right now, all he thinks is that you're lying.<eos> What do you think?
But the funny thing is, I think I'm looking after her, and she thinks she's looking after me.<eos> But who's to know who's right, eh?<eos> This is where the dads said it should be.<eos> I really love your dads.<eos> Just the fact that they all wanted to take care of you and be a part of your life.
You mean besides your amazing girlfriend?<eos> Who's been beyond amazing.<eos> Like, approaching saint status.<eos> I would look good as a statue. I'm serious.<eos> I know I could not survive any of this crazy shit without you.
Thank you.<eos> Stop it. I'm not going anywhere with you.<eos> Don't be a child, Daniela.<eos> Don't treat me like one.<eos> Everything I built in this world, I built for you.
I have to admit, I'm very uncomfortable with this level of uncertainty.<eos> No, but what is the alternative?<eos> [Priya] Kala?<eos> You have a visitor.<eos> We can stay with you.
Listen, D, I'm sorry.<eos> You can't just apologize for something like this, man.<eos> Will you please just let me try to explain, okay?<eos> All I'm asking for is two minutes.<eos> I don't have two minutes for you.
Everything I considered my home... is gone.<eos> Every time I begin to feel I belong somewhere... I have to leave.<eos> I'm trapped between what I want and what I know I can't have.<eos> Mom... I miss you.<eos> I measure so much of my life against one afternoon with you.
But I lost and made you sad.<eos> I'm not sad, Sun.<eos> Then why are you crying?<eos> Mothers worry for their daughters.<eos> I'm always afraid for you when I come to these matches.
It's important. - What are you talking about?<eos> - There are certain high-level clients here at CMA who just, you know, they just simply don't agree with your, um...<eos> I don't know, what do you want to call it?<eos> - It's not a lifestyle.<eos> Look, they told management in no uncertain terms that it was either them or you.
I don't mean to be.<eos> - I know.<eos> - It's just...<eos> I've never loved anyone, anyone... the way that I love you.<eos> I promise I will come back to you.
- Mandiba doesn't care.<eos> He's on trial for corruption.<eos> This is small potatoes.<eos> But what it demonstrates is his desperation.<eos> He's afraid of you.
I lost my Instagram followers, my Twitter followers.<eos> - I've lost...<eos> - Shut up!<eos> You have a man who loves you.<eos> And you have a friend who was willing to give up her life for you.
- Yeah, she seemed...<eos> - Exactly. Yeah. I felt the same.<eos> Here.<eos> Lick this.<eos> Hmm... So, rather than allowing myself to be paralyzed by doubt, a mistake I have made in the past, I am considering a more, you know, proactive approach, like you or Sun, and simply telling Rajan everything.
[clears throat softly] [stutters] Your thiamine is low and the lack of iron is affecting your adrenals, which is why you're craving the drugs.<eos> Heroin is not going help you figure out how to find Whispers.<eos> You need to eat properly, take your medicine, and focus.<eos> You will be fine.<eos> So will you.
Heroin is not going help you figure out how to find Whispers.<eos> You need to eat properly, take your medicine, and focus.<eos> You will be fine.<eos> So will you.<eos> [Jela chuckles] Ah, look at you.
- Whoever's after you is probably after her.<eos> He's a good cop.<eos> It also means they're gonna come after anyone who tries to help us.<eos> What'd he say?<eos> He's just worried about you.
[orchestral music plays] Lito!<eos> Burt Lancaster had this... power.<eos> Oh, I get that.<eos> [Lito] They all wanted to be her.<eos> Did you want Burt to kiss and drip on you, too?
I need your advice.<eos> I know you know what's going on, how delicate the situation is.<eos> - It's not my business.<eos> - No.<eos> And I appreciate that about you, but... this is about Lila, and the way she talks about you.
You know this city. You know this world.<eos> I'm not asking for you to get involved.<eos> I just need information.<eos> You were right about the difference between us.<eos> I want to live as you live, without a leash around my neck.
I must go.<eos> I would like to continue this conversation.<eos> I'll find you.<eos> I know you're angry... but this is how a girl like me tells a boy like you that she has a crush on you.<eos> And instead of laying in bed, wishing she was going out with you and not her current boyfriend... she has decided to do something about it.
We just had a disagreement.<eos> It sounded serious.<eos> It's just late.<eos> - You should go back to bed, Kala.<eos> - What about you?
[Sun] How without Nomi?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Hello, Officer.<eos> I do believe you're in need of assistance.<eos> Who the hell are you?
- It's an emergency.<eos> It's happening again.<eos> I don't believe this.<eos> I know you're a little old-fashioned, Wolfgang.<eos> Some part of you thinks it should be the man who proposes to the woman, but... from the first moment our eyes touched, I could feel our fates were connected.
I promised you, no middle ground.<eos> How do I know you won't just sell me out like everyone else?<eos> You're not like everyone else.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But you are.
I told you this was a waste of our time.<eos> - Wolfgang.<eos> This city needs a true king.<eos> These people are desperate for a leader.<eos> I know they will go to their knees for a man like you.
This is Berlin.<eos> These are my people.<eos> And we go to our knees for no one.<eos> Take your fucking "mai soil" and the three guns Fuchs hired and fuck off.<eos> I'm going to enjoy scraping you off my shoe like the dog shit you are.
Because of Lila?<eos> I was surprised you came to the restaurant.<eos> Surprised?<eos> Why?<eos> Maybe everything would be easier for you if I wasn't...
What matters to me is this. Us.<eos> Right now.<eos> And I know you feel the same.<eos> I do.<eos> But I can't be with you in my city.
I know things were difficult between you and your father.<eos> Maybe... Maybe you didn't go to your father because, in the end, he wasn't that important to you.<eos> Maybe you're not the son you thought you were.<eos> I can imagine facing that truth would be particularly painful.<eos> You and I? We are getting closer and closer, Will.
Come here, I want you to meet our Jordi.<eos> This is Marc Jacobs, he's our designer.<eos> And Charlie.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Kit told us all about you.
Looks good.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You're looking very good, too.<eos> It isn't really me, either.<eos> Hey, man, look at you.
Baby, baby, baby, baby, look at me.<eos> You are a great actor.<eos> And you're scared right now because art, like life, is... is full of risk.<eos> And that's beautiful.<eos> But I will remind you... what you said to me when we were watching From Here to Eternity.
He's got a knife!<eos> Will.<eos> Will. that was not good.<eos> I know you're in pain.<eos> I know you feel lost, but... right now, we need you.
Will.<eos> Will. that was not good.<eos> I know you're in pain.<eos> I know you feel lost, but... right now, we need you.<eos> I need you.
Will. that was not good.<eos> I know you're in pain.<eos> I know you feel lost, but... right now, we need you.<eos> I need you.<eos> Capheus needs you.
So it is.<eos> Why did you save me?<eos> The last scene of The Legend of Superpower and Van Damn sure as shit don't belong to some political bullshit plot cooked up by bossman Mandiba.<eos> But you work for him.<eos> Mandiba aren't from Kibera like you and me.
What happened?<eos> I'm okay. I'm okay.<eos> What you said on that stage was good for people to hear.<eos> You were amazing.<eos> I want to grow up so I can vote for you.
And I wish you and Tom all the best.<eos> I would totally wear this if it came in my size.<eos> I can't believe she's already having her third child.<eos> It's wonderful.<eos> And she's a year younger than you, Kala.
She should be solving, like, global warming.<eos> - Such a way of thinking you have.<eos> - Am I wrong?<eos> She's your friend.<eos> She's discovering her life the same as you are.
When you say "not good," usually means stuff's going to start blowing up and people will start dying.<eos> Maybe it's time for me to leave this town.<eos> India plan.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Is everything all right between you and Rajan?
See you.<eos> If you do become president, will you stop driving the Van Damn?<eos> Never.<eos> Come.<eos> What can I do for you, Van Damn?
Are you helping me because undermining Mandiba's control over this city is good for your business interests?<eos> The easiest decisions in this world are those where what is good for business is also good for your family.<eos> F... Family?<eos> You know I'm deeply indebted.<eos> And you know my daughter cares very much about you.
Oh, my God.<eos> Lito, you have to get up, right now!<eos> If you don't do it...<eos> No, I'm gonna make you do it, because it's so freaking perfect.<eos> It's you and Hernando. It...
Lito, you have to get up, right now!<eos> If you don't do it...<eos> No, I'm gonna make you do it, because it's so freaking perfect.<eos> It's you and Hernando. It...<eos> - It's meant for you.
Mom!<eos> Go ahead. Take his side.<eos> Even when he destroys your wedding.<eos> Please, don't make it any worse.<eos> Go with these men and we'll see if anything can be done for you later.
"Pretty good"?<eos> Lito, you're crying snot.<eos> Okay, it's brilliant.<eos> It is. It is. It so is.<eos> It's perfect for you.
Oh, yeah.<eos> Javier's amazing.<eos> You see?<eos> Even the love of my life thinks there are better choices.<eos> No. It is meant for you.
I can hear your voice, I can see you as Jordi Gallo.<eos> All we have to do is get you in the room with these people, and they will see it, too.<eos> Dani, please, stop torturing me.<eos> I'm not torturing you.<eos> I believe in you.
Carol Cumberland took a bunch of pills and slit her wrists.<eos> Why?<eos> Why was Jonas there?<eos> Are you asking me or someone else in your head?<eos> You.
Where are you?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> - I'm okay, Dad.<eos> - You're not okay!<eos> There are government agents saying all kinds of fucked up shit about you.
What did you really think?<eos> It was almost like the real thing.<eos> The NSA has good people. Very good.<eos> - Too good.<eos> - Not as good as you.
- They'll been watching me.<eos> This is a trap. - Or the only way out.<eos> God damn it.<eos> - You want out?<eos> - Don't you?
Quite as usual?<eos> Kinda what you'd be expecting when you work in a bookstore.<eos> - And how's your job, Paul?<eos> Took a couple of days off until we're all settled in.<eos> I'm sure they will survive without you.
You seem stressed.<eos> No, no, everything's fine.<eos> - Mostly, I mean.<eos> - Mostly?<eos> We need you, Paul.
No, no, everything's fine.<eos> - Mostly, I mean.<eos> - Mostly?<eos> We need you, Paul.<eos> We need you, Paul.
- Mostly, I mean.<eos> - Mostly?<eos> We need you, Paul.<eos> We need you, Paul.<eos> We need you, Paul.
Then, perhaps you can use this.<eos> - What is this?<eos> - It's a necklace.<eos> It's used to ward off evil. For protection.<eos> Will it protect me against you?
Yes, I will go change.<eos> Uh, okay, he's acting fucking weird.<eos> He's trying to be on best behavior.<eos> I suggest you do the same.<eos> We're changing our plans for you. Don't forget that.
We're changing our plans for you. Don't forget that.<eos> Without a reservation, it's gonna be a few minutes.<eos> You may wait at the bar, if you wish.<eos> Bar sounds good. I could use a drink.<eos> Karen, you?
You can tell me what the fuck is up with Paul.<eos> - Okay, just drop it. All right?<eos> - You can't tell me you didn't notice.<eos> Please.<eos> Those weird remarks at the bartender, staring at the waitress' ass all evening, while flirting with her right in front of you.
If your goal tonight was to make me jealous, you failed miserably.<eos> I'm fucking pissed off.<eos> - As long as fucking is in the equation.<eos> - Are you insane?<eos> You actually think I'm gonna have sex with you after the way you behaved tonight?
Can I help you with something, Paul?<eos> Actually you can.<eos> And I think I might be able to help you, as well.<eos> You see, her loss is your gain.<eos> Now I see what Jenny sees in you.
Try for yourself.<eos> - Weird.<eos> You know what, I'm gonna call Monica, the realtor.<eos> Let's see if she's got a key.<eos> I have a surprise for you.
What re you hiding down here?<eos> Is it like a torture dungeon?<eos> - Close. Very close.<eos> - Did you guys get a sex wing?<eos> After you.
See, I expect this one to be an especially tasty meal.<eos> Repressed sexual energy is a very potent source. It can just be sucked out.<eos> It's finally time.<eos> Now, I must join the party.<eos> When I am reborn, you will be the first to feed me.
Skivvying?<eos> Cleaning, offices.<eos> No shame in it.<eos> Never said there is.<eos> It's all right for you.
She'd been drowned.<eos> You didn't send her there?<eos> She resigned yesterday morning, just after you left.<eos> I have to ask...<eos> Kent Finn, he said he was with you the night Miss Palfrey died.
This does not end well.<eos> Like it was going so good before?<eos> Okay, we need a plan.<eos> Yo, who's the one in charge here?<eos> You with the mouth, or me with the gun?
Hey, you wanna be in charge?<eos> It's fine by me.<eos> All right, why don't you both just calm down, all right? Just...<eos> Someone tell me what the hell is going on.<eos> - You.
It's not for him. It's for me.<eos> Did you do this?<eos> No, but...<eos> Yo, his skin be going all gray like he's cloudy and overcast.<eos> For you.
I always miss all the fun.<eos> I missed the lake.<eos> I missed the riot.<eos> The mass shooter roaming the halls?<eos> Poor you.
Can't we, you know, cut some wires or something?<eos> We? Piss off, Bloody Mary.<eos> I'm not helping you.<eos> I'm making earplugs out of pencil erasers.<eos> You know, Flores is outside with a shiv, and I'm closer to the door than you are.
You out there?<eos> Where's a fucking hammer when you need one?<eos> You hear that?<eos> She said she's ready to gut you like a shark that's eaten a toddler.<eos> If you're... if you're coming in here to have sex or whatever, you can do it, but I'm gonna be here reading Rilke out loud in German.

Even when we really don't want to be.<eos> I've already tried to kill myself once.<eos> And you are still here, right?<eos> Not so easy to shake this mortal coil.<eos> Until someone sits on you till you die.
Now he doesn't have the magic combination.<eos> Idiot.<eos> This where you're keeping guards?<eos> We got a big one here for you.<eos> Hey, Daya, we need you again. We gotta open the door.
I'm not not scared.<eos> Me, too.<eos> Not not.<eos> Don't do that.<eos> Hey! You!
You can do this, Kazumi.<eos> I'm doing my best.<eos> It's coming.<eos> Any moment now, okay, push.<eos> Easy for you to say.
You don't go in that lab without a proper rest.<eos> For all I know, we're carrying Anthrax on board.<eos> You can't compare Calvin to Anthrax.<eos> I know at least five guys back home that can do my job.<eos> Nobody can do yours except you.
Watch his hand.<eos> Get him!<eos> Adamsss!<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - David, I need you here.
Hey!<eos> Rory, stop, stop!<eos> Rory?<eos> You're out of fuel.<eos> It's behind you!
Then I have to walk.<eos> Let me.<eos> No.<eos> After Rory, I'm best qualified for walk and repair.<eos> This is not protocol. It's way too risky for you go out there to fix the comms.
No life support - no life.<eos> Right.<eos> OK, Hugh and I will sweep from quest east.<eos> And...<eos> You and Sho scout the poles and lock off each compartment.
You and Sho scout the poles and lock off each compartment.<eos> This will take about... 4 hours to vent all oxygen.<eos> - What do we do till then?<eos> - We wait.<eos> You okay?
But that's... Well, that's because you're honest about what you love.<eos> And underneath it all, that's... Inspiring.<eos> And I'm sorry too. Not about the sex,<eos> I don't even really remember it.<eos> Mostly my part in fucking up something that was good for you.
- It's what makes you feel the pain will burn you till there's nothing.<eos> And, yes, it's also there for love, but, uh, let's be Frank, darling, you're more likely to throw yourself off a bridge than ever love again.<eos> I felt that way.<eos> And I knew it crippled me when I needed to be strong.<eos> As you do now.
He always talks nonsense.<eos> I hope you don't mind him.<eos> - It's all right.<eos> So.. Mrs. Mukherjee..<eos> Whenever she talks about you all she does is sing praises of you.
and I think, that's really amazing.<eos> Thank you.<eos> May I say something, Su?<eos> A person's trust in himself, is his strength.<eos> We are not weak, you and I.
But.. In the dark, if you have a partner the void can be filled. Am I right?<eos> You have confused me, completely!<eos> Do you want to get married or not?<eos> I want to, but not right now.<eos> I want to give you some time.
I dance.<eos> Do you dance well?<eos> - I think, I dance quite well.<eos> Really? - Yes.<eos> What about you?
Parveen knows all of these rituals.<eos> She was the one who decorated your bedroom.<eos> Zafar. - Yes? - Thanks.<eos> - Stop it. Listen..<eos> - I have a special gift for you.
Hey, what happened?<eos> - That's better.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Actually, Ms. Su the driver thought we would not realise it.<eos> And I knew that it was you, my dubbing artist.
I must watch out.<eos> Well, that is true..<eos> Who is there?<eos> Amit?<eos> Is that you?
- I don't want to go.. Su..<eos> - Why don't you get it, what they're doing to us?<eos> Please!<eos> - But..<eos> I was molested, but they have been ill-treating you too.
I know that we will never be the same as we were before.<eos> I will consider that.. whatever we had before yesterday was simply a dream.<eos> Dinner is on the table, Rohan.<eos> Have a little before going to bed.<eos> 'Your wife is so good that she can starve for you..'
Since you had dubbed these voices, I had no other choice.<eos> Ready.<eos> - Great!<eos> Let's go again.<eos> 'Your wife is so good that she can starve for you' 'but she can never keep her mouth shut.'
Mr. Bhatnagar.. I don't understand one thing about your wife.<eos> If she had to commit suicide, why didn't she do it after the first molestation?<eos> Why did she do it after the second one?<eos> See you around.<eos> 'Rohan, neither you nor your love for me is weak.'
'No problem. You can hear it now.'<eos> 'And get used to it' 'because we'll be visiting often now.'<eos> 'We will come whenever we want.'<eos> 'Come on, let's try something new today.'<eos> 'I know how hard this is for you' 'and I love you so much'
But that stops now.<eos> Now, you must stop going around with such friends.<eos> Pay attention to the campaign.<eos> We have the election in two months.<eos> If I hear about another issue involving you I will send you to Pune to sister, do you get it?
You're asking me what you've done!<eos> Yes.<eos> - I'll kill you if you call her again!<eos> What?<eos> - I'll make you handicapped for life!
"Since a few days" "I've gotten used to you."<eos> "Since a few days" "I've gotten used to you."<eos> "Since a few days" "you've become my habit."<eos> "Your smile makes me smile."<eos> "I want to get lost in you."
"Since a few days" "I've gotten used to you."<eos> "Since a few days" "you've become my habit."<eos> "Your smile makes me smile."<eos> "I want to get lost in you."<eos> "I don't think" "I can live without you now."
Lubna is my sister! Understand?<eos> And both of us had fun with that woman!<eos> Twice!<eos> You're talking about that blind woman today.<eos> Who was she to you?
Who was she to you?<eos> Everything.<eos> She was all I ever had.<eos> How did you talk in Amit's voice?<eos> You were the one on the phone, weren't you?
Listen, I want nobody there.<eos> We have to meet secretly.<eos> Bye.<eos> 'Are you all right, Rohan? '<eos> You!
I could have arrested your brother in Pune for Wasim's murder.<eos> But I didn't.<eos> - Why?<eos> Because I show my cards only when I have three aces.<eos> Neither you, nor this city will burn.
Amit?<eos> No. Shelar.<eos> How did you get out of that colony?<eos> Zaffar. - Yes, Rohan. - Listen.<eos> I need Percy, Sakharam and you.
'Perfect world, sir.<eos> Everyone is blind.'<eos> No!<eos> I see you relaxed after a very long time.<eos> So what if I'm not with you? I'll always be around you, Rohan.
Bethie, baby, time to be back.<eos> It's late, why don't you guys just stay over?<eos> Come on, Case.<eos> I got some Sponge Bobs loaded on the iPad. Bethie hasn't seen him.<eos> I ain't done with you but it's a long shot.
I'd love to...<eos> Oh no, really?<eos> Why is my purse so heavy?<eos> Must be sweet having such a great mum.<eos> You know, when you were a baby your father used to take you out on long walks around here.
Like he was never there.<eos> It's all right.<eos> And... When you least expect it... Out of the blue...<eos> There he is.<eos> None of this is just you.
- Mamma?<eos> Where are we?<eos> You don't remember?<eos> No.<eos> You, me, your Dad...
- I'm OK. - Yeah?<eos> - Promise?<eos> - You promise, huh?<eos> How's mamma?<eos> She's fine, because you and I are gonna stick together. And we're gonna make sure...
Please, mamma, we need help.<eos> Just until you get a little bit better.<eos> Grandma's time machine.<eos> She keeps everything the same, she would still treat me like I'm 16.<eos> How are you doing?
Listen to me.<eos> Those animals aren't gonna... come near us.<eos> They've been warned.<eos> They know where we live.<eos> God! You're beautiful.
I don't get why we're going to meet him, though.<eos> You don't get shit. That's why they called me.<eos> No, I just... Ah, my dick!<eos> Yo, I almost frigging burned my dick off.<eos> No, I don't get why he called ...you.
- This is good as shit, yeah.<eos> There he is.<eos> He's gone.<eos> So, now what? He gets out?<eos> No, now you get out.
Heading to the mall.<eos> Anyone wanna join me for a bit of shopping?<eos> I do!<eos> Can we get some food along the way?<eos> Only if you're driving.
- I'll go check on her.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Fritz Haaber?<eos> Who wants to know?<eos> It is you.
You know? I never had a daughter.<eos> You've never been married.<eos> Have you?<eos> I'll tell you something.<eos> If I ever do have a daughter. I hope she grows up to be just like you.
Here's the Swiss chard.<eos> Thank you, Francesca.<eos> Hi, Dev.<eos> Hi, how are you?<eos> Good. You? Good.
Why can't you be like American kids?<eos> They're all spoiled, and they have phones.<eos> Go!<eos> Go! Go! Ask him if you can use his phone.<eos> Why me and not you?
- Hey.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Happy birthday.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - I have some gifts for you.
- I want a countdown. - Yeah. Five, four, three, two...<eos> You came early.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Almost there.<eos> I wanna die inside the mouth of a lion with you.
And that's great.<eos> That's good.<eos> And you are strong.<eos> It's just...<eos> I don't know. Look, I wanna be in the lion's mouth with you.
It feels so bad, okay?<eos> And I didn't even get this one from sex. I just walked around in wet underwear for a couple of days.<eos> You're gross.<eos> Hannah, can you text that one interesting lesbian you know and see if she can get me into the "New York Mag" party tonight?<eos> I don't know, Elijah. My bladder's on fire. I don't know if I feel like abusing my media contacts for you right now.
And I think it would be good for your health.<eos> Oh, for my health? Okay.<eos> So, I should just bail on my recovery? - Do you think that's a good idea?<eos> - No.<eos> Hey, nice doing business with you.
Do you have any idea how hard this has been for me?<eos> I have bruises all over my body from the two-hour massages that I need to deal with the stress of your addiction.<eos> Are you... are you serious?<eos> - Did you hear what she said, man? - Yeah.<eos> Because you just made my whole drug treatment about you.
Maybe it's about picking who to listen to.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> How long were you on the community board? Three months?<eos> Then you quietly retreated back to dating girls with six packs and pretending death wasn't real.<eos> I'm worried about you, Ray.
You hate your wife. You hate your job.<eos> The only thing that gives you a glimmer of joy on this planet is recycling soda cans.<eos> - It's free money! - You know what, Herm?<eos> You're starting to really fucking piss me off.<eos> I work hard for you.
What about the party?<eos> Ugh, it was total bullshit.<eos> It was just, like, a bunch of old gays being like, "Oh, I'm so busy during the week.<eos> I can only do uppers on the weekends."<eos> Oh, well, good for you, Anthony.
Hermie?<eos> You there?<eos> I'm opening up, you deaf bastard.<eos> Coming in.<eos> Hey, wake up. I gotta talk to you.
You there?<eos> I'm opening up, you deaf bastard.<eos> Coming in.<eos> Hey, wake up. I gotta talk to you.<eos> Wake up, you motherfucker! Wake up!
Yeah. Turns out he actually had a disease, the old dick.<eos> What did he have, if you don't mind my asking?<eos> Scleroderma. It's a really horrible disease.<eos> Leave it to Hermie to find the world's most obscure terminal illness, show zero external symptoms, and then die binge-watching "The Equalizer."<eos> Well, I know what he meant to you.
Oh, all right. Well, I'm gonna just make a call.<eos> Okay, yeah. Let us know if you need anything.<eos> - Water or something. - Just one thing, just one thing.<eos> - I have an idea.<eos> - Yeah. I think what we really need right now is we need a tight on you of your annoyance at the fact that you have to indulge her.
Look at this. Captain of the high school tennis team.<eos> He won a game off John McEnroe once.<eos> - Did he really, though?<eos> Is there somewhere you need to be?<eos> Nope. Here with you.
Right, I don't need you here, I want you here.<eos> But if you need to go, that's fine, you know.<eos> No, no, no, no, no. Don't put words in my mouth.<eos> I want to be here for... with...<eos> for you and with you, just maybe not in this exact house.
And you really might meet someone.<eos> I know it doesn't feel that way right now, but...<eos> Stop fucking saying that.<eos> - Mom, I really wasn't...<eos> - See you back at the apartment.
I could be a cool single mom, you know, like Lorelai Gilmore.<eos> Elijah, I don't know what to say.<eos> I always told you I wanted to be a mother someday.<eos> Yeah, one day. You said one day you wanted to be a mother.<eos> We got a really special, specific thing going on, you and me, yeah?
- Fuck you. - You know what? You've said so many mean things to me and I can't make one stupid salvia joke?<eos> Elijah, come on!<eos> I don't know, I kind of thought you'd be happy.<eos> You're not ready for this.<eos> No, you're not ready for this.
So, you're not gonna be the first.<eos> Can you stand up? I'm done.<eos> My life is done.<eos> That's not true.<eos> You're not done. I need you.
Can you stand up? I'm done.<eos> My life is done.<eos> That's not true.<eos> You're not done. I need you.<eos> We need you. You're gonna be a grandma. Remember, Grandma Loreen?
Previously on "Bates Motel"...<eos> I am dead.<eos> And why am I pretending to be dead?<eos> So I could get away from everyone, everything that could distract me from you.
And I'm still alive.<eos> For now.<eos> Great seeing you, Sheriff.<eos> Mm.<eos> I'm coming for you when you least expect it, so don't get too cozy up at that house all by yourself.
No. I came to see you.<eos> This double date...<eos> I just came by to see... what kind of a man you are.<eos> I'm not sure we have the same dictionary definition.<eos> I'm not gonna stand here and explain myself to you.
I didn't see any people I know. - I looked.<eos> - Mother!<eos> Just go out the window now.<eos> Take the keys.<eos> Get in the back of the car and lay down so no one can see you.
I never thought your little device would actually work.<eos> How did you find me?<eos> The details aren't important.<eos> Yeah, I suppose not.<eos> I wasn't sure the machine would return to you.
You know you can walk into a shop here and purchase a rifle or a revolver, and it's perfectly legal?<eos> These people encourage it.<eos> No, I'm not going anywhere.<eos> I've yet to begin in this age.<eos> It's you who should run along back to your timid life.
Well, I can't have you chasing after me across centuries.<eos> Who knows where I might want to venture to next?<eos> Well, I don't have it with me.<eos> Herbert George, come on.<eos> I've played countless games of chess with you, and the one thing you cannot do is bluff.
Meet me at the bridge in Central Park tomorrow at noon.<eos> Key gets you Jane.<eos> Where is Central Park?<eos> You're a clever bunny, you'll figure it out.<eos> No police, just you.
She's dead.<eos> I apologize, sir.<eos> I saw you give him the key, I gave the word to Carl to move in.<eos> Her death is on your head.<eos> But she is his only leverage over you.
Let her go, John.<eos> I thought I might see you here.<eos> And here we are again.<eos> This isn't about her.<eos> This is about you and me.
Like it was you and me in the park?<eos> You must think I'm a fool.<eos> There's no one else here.<eos> I came completely alone.<eos> Well, then you're the fool.
No siblings, no extended family.<eos> There is no one else.<eos> Why are you telling me this?<eos> I took the shirt you were wearing when you first arrived and had a genealogy test done from the blood and DNA on it.<eos> The preliminary results are back, and I'm not really sure how, but you and I... We're family.
I am you.
I am you.<eos> I'd like to feel what you feel... think what you think.<eos> I want to suck every part of your body.<eos> Nothing about you disgusts me.
- Recently... - There are moments...<eos> - ...<eos> I dreamed I was inside you.<eos> - When I want to stop being me...<eos> - I could feel inside you.
- ...<eos> I dreamed I was inside you.<eos> - When I want to stop being me...<eos> - I could feel inside you.<eos> - So I can be you.
- When I want to stop being me...<eos> - I could feel inside you.<eos> - So I can be you.<eos> You are me.<eos> I am you.
No!<eos> Don't open it.<eos> Are you sure you want to do it?<eos> Yes.<eos> Aren't you?
I'm so happy to have your semen inside me.<eos> It's like you hadn't left.<eos> I don't know why I couldn't control it.<eos> Hey, don't worry, my period's due any day.<eos> - I am you.
It's like you hadn't left.<eos> I don't know why I couldn't control it.<eos> Hey, don't worry, my period's due any day.<eos> - I am you.<eos> - And I am you.
- No.<eos> - Are you sure?<eos> - Why, what was it? Drugs?<eos> Hey, I didn't look!<eos> Before you took it, was anyone else looking at it?
I'm the father-in-law.<eos> - I mean, the father.<eos> - Don't listen to him.<eos> - I'll take those.<eos> - No, they're not for you.
She'll be annoyed, but she had me at 17.<eos> You'll be cleaning up baby shit and missing college.<eos> Do you want to spend another four years studying?<eos> Fuck, Laura, you'll get a belly, you'll be like a cow.<eos> You'll be the fucking joke of the school.
- Who was it?<eos> - My boyfriend from the village.<eos> Well, my ex.<eos> He called and said he wanted to see me.<eos> I told him I was with you.
- What would you have done?<eos> - We're not talking about that.<eos> What would you have done?<eos> I don't know. I don't know.<eos> I'm 18 and you're 17.
Yes.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm sorry that you're worried.<eos> I'd like to be able to love the way you can.
Then you can pay for it.<eos> Tomorrow you start looking for a weekend job.<eos> Is that what you care about?<eos> Have you nothing to tell me?<eos> To tell you?
I need you to do me a favor.<eos> Pablo found... part of a wrapper from a condom<eos> in our bedroom.<eos> If he asks me again,<eos> I'm going to tell him that I've spoken to you and that you and Carlos used the bedroom when we weren't here.
It's the first place they'd look.<eos> You'll miss this term but then you can make it up.<eos> Then you can study or do what you want.<eos> I don't want to study.<eos> I'll be working, so I can take care of you.
- Have you seen my boyfriend?<eos> - No, but if I were him, I wouldn't leave you on your own.<eos> When will you give me a chance?<eos> I'd never get involved with you.<eos> I don't want to get involved, I want to be with you.
I swear.<eos> Go back to your friends.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I'd like you to be happy.<eos> I'm happy with you.
Look at yourself, you're not okay.<eos> - Let Alex take you.<eos> - Yes, Alex can take you.<eos> Sure, I don't mind.<eos> I wanted to take you home.
Hurry back.<eos> OCCUPIED<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - Waiting for Laura.<eos> I thought she was with you.
- You love her very much, don't you? - Yes.<eos> I think we just need some time.<eos> - If we're alone, we can sort it out.<eos> - What you need is to give each other space.<eos> Laura is too young for such a serious relationship, and so are you.
Laura is too young for such a serious relationship, and so are you.<eos> You still have a lot of living to do.<eos> We love each other.<eos> There she is.<eos> If she wants to go away with you for a few days, I don't mind.
Moro.<eos> - Moro.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> What is it?<eos> We had a jealous boyfriend here looking for you.
It's true.<eos> Until a good dick appears.<eos> I think I did it to try to forget you, and so you'd forget me.<eos> Did you fuck him?<eos> Being with you was the loveliest, most romantic thing I've ever known,
Did you fuck him?<eos> Being with you was the loveliest, most romantic thing I've ever known,<eos> and I regret telling the girls about what we did.<eos> Did you come?<eos> No one has given me as much pleasure as you.
I did this so you'll never forget our story.<eos> I had to redo it lots of times.<eos> Did you come?<eos> Yes, I came.<eos> Sex with you is wonderful.
I hope we realize we can't live without each other, and we can start over from the beginning.<eos> Stop.<eos> Please, don't forget me.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I am you.
Stop.<eos> Please, don't forget me.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I am you.<eos> I am you.
Please, don't forget me.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I am you.<eos> I am you.<eos> I am you.
I am you.<eos> I am you.<eos> I am you.<eos> I'd like to feel what you feel, think what you think.<eos> I am you.
I am you.<eos> I am you.<eos> I'd like to feel what you feel, think what you think.<eos> I am you.<eos> I am you.
I am you.<eos> I am you.<eos> - You are me.<eos> - You are me.<eos> - I could feel inside you.
- I could feel inside you.<eos> - There are moments,<eos> - when I want to stop being me...<eos> - I dreamed I was inside you.<eos> - ...so I can be you.

- Just last night.<eos> Do you remember last night, Norman?<eos> I was, uh, just drinking more than I should have, so, you know, things are a little foggy.<eos> I found you passed out, so I put you to bed.<eos> Hey, I got a question for you.
Do you often have times like that where you get unconscious?<eos> Sometimes, yeah.<eos> Right.<eos> I'm gonna hang out here.<eos> Keep an eye on you.
Where'd you come from?<eos> Where am I?<eos> You're still in Norma's basement.<eos> Hey. Cut me loose.<eos> You and I got no beef.
Mm.<eos> That's not my role here.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I don't feel that I have the authority to act in that manner.<eos> This is between you and Norma, and what happens to you now, it's up to Norma, and I'm just an observer.
Jason, I'm not...<eos> I'm not gonna kill you.<eos> Nothing's gonna happen.<eos> All right?<eos> I need to put some distance between you and me before the police find you.
Talk?<eos> About what?<eos> I unexpectedly found myself... caught up in your family's drama.<eos> Is that the word?<eos> And I don't know anything about you.
- No, not at all.<eos> - I want a cookie.<eos> What kind of cookies?<eos> Chocolate chip.<eos> It's actually very kind of you.

What, so cops? FBI? They're all wrong?<eos> - They're hiding the truth.<eos> - Why would they lie?<eos> I don't know, Dad.<eos> All I do know is I'm not gonna risk you and Mom getting caught up in this, too.
- Tell him what I just told you.<eos> Tell him to keep it to himself and make something up.<eos> I need a couple of days, at least.<eos> Where you going?<eos> This is for you and Mom.
Sorry, sweetheart. It's work.<eos> Bry?<eos> Where are you right now?<eos> I'm at home.<eos> Why? Lianne with you?
What happened, baby?<eos> Isn't everything happening too fast?<eos> We've been seeing each other since high school.<eos> How much more time do you need?<eos> Don't you need more time?
- Yes, let's go.<eos> There's nothing to worry about. - Let's go.<eos> You got us worried for nothing.<eos> Don't worry, go to sleep.<eos> Are you scared? Do you want me to sleep beside you?
Anu!<eos> Anu!<eos> - What happened?<eos> Dude, I think I'm still having a bad trip.<eos> Can I sleep with you?
Why didn't you tell me that he's upstairs?<eos> I.. Okay then, he's not in his room.<eos> What's going on?<eos> So early in the morning..<eos> You too?
Or I.. I could even live for 100 years.<eos> Please don't say that.<eos> I hope you die soon so that I am free of you.<eos> Here I'm the one who is saddled with a ghost. You want to get rid of me?<eos> Yes, but you are the one who married me.
What the.. Why don't you leave me alone?<eos> You want me to leave you alone?<eos> Great. She's been drinking too.<eos> No, look..<eos> I wasn't.. I wasn't talking to you.

Wait, what?<eos> Prescription medication.<eos> Specifically for osteoporosis.<eos> No.<eos> The part about you neutering your husband.
But recently...<eos> Cam, there are so many refugee children out there in the world.<eos> And I just feel in my heart that I would be a really...<eos> You would make such a good father.<eos> And I am with you.

Got that?<eos> Mellie needs you.<eos> I just need a minute.<eos> She's refusing to accept defeat.<eos> The only person who can see her through this is you.

I may be a sophisti-cat, but not so sophisticated as to forge something like that.<eos> Besides... what angle could I possibly have in coming here and telling you that it looks like your brother might just be alive?<eos> It's impossible.<eos> That's what I thought.<eos> Why'd he send it to you?
Hell if I know what that means.<eos> But just like that envelope's addressed to me, those words are addressed to me.<eos> Got to be!<eos> Get out.<eos> I'm trying to work with you here.
- Sure, man. Yeah.<eos> Come here.<eos> I want you to go wash up, okay?<eos> And then you can catch up with your uncle.<eos> He hasn't just mythologized you.
What the hell was that for?<eos> Sucre, what the hell are you doing here?<eos> C-Note told me what's going on.<eos> He tell you to talk me out of it?<eos> No. I'm coming with you.
A raconteur.<eos> I don't think that means what you think it means.<eos> Don't speak to me like I don't know French, I know French.<eos> And I'm brown, that's something.<eos> I'll fit in better over there than you will, snowflake.

Well, I'm not gonna challenge the logic in that.<eos> Noel's dead, but Jenna's still out there.<eos> - I mean, we have to find her.<eos> - We will.<eos> But I'm not taking any chances with you.

I know.<eos> They could've left traps in her.<eos> Mag pulses, viruses.<eos> She's right.<eos> You will be exposing your mind to who ever hacked her. You'll be wide open.
You're not here looking for any trouble, are you?<eos> I'm just here for the girls... and beer.<eos> - Can I help you?<eos> - I'm looking for someone.<eos> You been here before?
Why don't you come have fun with us?<eos> Have some privacy.<eos> I'm in.<eos> I'll be here when you need me.<eos> - You say your friend worked here?
They don't.<eos> You've been inside the same shell as he has.<eos> That could have very serious consequences.<eos> You were not authorized to deep dive the geisha.<eos> You're disappointed.
No, I'm worried.<eos> You're not invulnerable.<eos> I can repair your body, but I can't protect your mind.<eos> Why not?<eos> You can see all my thoughts so... You should be able to secure them.

They never told us.<eos> It feels weird driving with these eyes.<eos> Why do you take that?<eos> Keeps my brain from rejecting this body.<eos> Major, Batou, you need to get here.
Enough, enough!<eos> We need him alive.<eos> Please.<eos> I have been through this.<eos> You have the wrong guy.
- We went to your apartment.<eos> There was nobody there. - No.<eos> You live there for 10 years by yourself.<eos> No.<eos> - You're just lying.
I know why we couldn't find him.<eos> He's using human minds to create a network of his own.<eos> We're coming to your position.<eos> Tell me who you are.<eos> I'm that which you seek to destroy.
Reading y-y-your code... when you were inside that geisha.<eos> Like nothing I had felt before, yet so... familiar.<eos> We are the same.<eos> We're not the same.<eos> You kill innocent people.

I do not consent.<eos> I do not consent.<eos> We never needed your consent;<eos> yours or anyone's.<eos> You're killing me, aren't you?

You kill her, you kill us.<eos> I'll take that under advisement.<eos> So what now?<eos> Oh, the poor pumpkin!<eos> Oh, you surprised me.
On the street, in my dreams.<eos> As if she's still here.<eos> She was... fearless.<eos> And wild.<eos> You remind me of her.
And wild.<eos> You remind me of her.<eos> Sorry.<eos> How do I remind you of her?<eos> The way you look at me.
You remind me of her.<eos> Sorry.<eos> How do I remind you of her?<eos> The way you look at me.<eos> Who are you?
I'm not ready to leave.<eos> I belong here.<eos> I'll always be there with you, in your ghost.<eos> Target is in view.<eos> What are you waiting for?
So, how do we get it back?<eos> These assholes just took out the best of the best like it was Sunday brunch.<eos> We need someone who can move like them, fight like them.<eos> We need someone who can walk into a tornado, and come out the other side like it was a damn gentle breeze.<eos> You know someone like that?
You can check your coat.<eos> I promise you, no one would dare steal it.<eos> I can't guarantee it won't walk off on its own.<eos> Wheels up in 10, boys!<eos> Which means you're already seven minutes behind.
Wheels up in 10, boys!<eos> Which means you're already seven minutes behind.<eos> Is she always this much fun, or just on special occasions?<eos> No wonder our country's in debt trillions of dollars.<eos> Do you really need all these gadgets to get the bad guys?
Oh, you don't play on bikes.<eos> Any of you ever carve an R4 on a snowboard while an avalanche is on your booty?<eos> We're soldiers, hotshot.<eos> Not slackers.<eos> Okay, but you all have HALO jumped over Eastern Europe using a standard-issue armor deployment parachute system. Am I right?
Now, this is a team I can work with.<eos> I'll make this easy for you.<eos> These four assholes, very bad guys.<eos> Pandora's Box, very bad thing.<eos> We'll land in Manila and you will requisition your own transportation to the island.
It killed Gibbons.<eos> All you need to know.<eos> The rest is classified.<eos> Brainwave scrambler.<eos> You smell that?
You think a dog knows how to work a Frisbee?<eos> Master says, "Fetch," and the bitch listens.<eos> You would look so sexy with a Frisbee in that mouth.<eos> Oh, sweetheart, this is not a game.<eos> You are all my soldiers now.
Oh, hell, no.<eos> I dropped your soldiers over Eastern Europe.<eos> So, why did you leave Lassie behind?<eos> This is my operation!<eos> You will listen to me.
I'm gonna use it.<eos> And I'll be damned if I'm gonna let you take it back to the NSA.<eos> Now, it's a party.<eos> Shit's about to go down.<eos> You ready to have some fun?
Shut up, "hero"!<eos> All right.<eos> Let's do this.<eos> Don't move!<eos> Okay, I actually have what you want.
Nobody ever sees me, boss.<eos> Now, these suits control every spy satellite in the sky.<eos> But how often do these seven men all sit in the same room together?<eos> Almost never.<eos> And if you needed retinal scans, cell phone data dumps, biometrics of all the superpowers in the world, who would you target?
Let me guess.<eos> Everyone's jumping at the chance to dismantle their spy programs.<eos> No.<eos> The world's too stupid to realize that Moscow wasn't a bluff.<eos> Okay, Triple-X, you will base out of an NSA safe house.
Uh, looks like East 404 Congress Street.<eos> He's on the top floor.<eos> I'm showing activity in Pandora's Box.<eos> I can jam the signal, but only for a few minutes, so hurry.<eos> You've got to get there fast and take this guy down.
Let's go!<eos> Shit.<eos> He's trying to reconnect it.<eos> Guys, I can only jam the signal for so long before he chooses another satellite.<eos> You have to hurry.
Gibbons thought you'd be back.<eos> To be the hero we needed.<eos> You take the box to the NSA, and we're right back to where we started.<eos> This is touching.<eos> Gibbons would be proud to see you two working together.
- But I want.<eos> - Go upstairs now.<eos> Ezekiel!<eos> It's the damnedest thing. Someone just stole my car!<eos> - You don't say?
Ezekiel!<eos> It's the damnedest thing. Someone just stole my car!<eos> - You don't say?<eos> - It's an '87 Cavalier.<eos> You should be more surprised.
Okay, Shimmer Lake?<eos> I'll wait for you.<eos> Fuck, Zeke.<eos> Mornin', Harris.<eos> Guess you're ridin' up front, huh?
Everything all right?<eos> - Yeah, everything's just peachy.<eos> - How's the shoulder?<eos> - It hurts. Ask a stupid question.<eos> Actually, when the bullet hit me, it didn't hurt as much as you'd think.

Mm. - Rippin' on you.<eos> - Yeah, you think so?<eos> Judge Dawkins!<eos> Zeke Sikes!<eos> Can you open up, please?
Judge?<eos> How many times do I have to tell you guys?<eos> Ed is the guy we're looking for.<eos> Andy is just a patsy.<eos> We understand that you got strong feelings on the matter.
We understand that you got strong feelings on the matter.<eos> The son of a bitch looked me in the eyes and shot me.<eos> - That's not feelings. That's fact.<eos> - Oh, come on, Zeke.<eos> This is where Kyle and I can use the Bureau's resources to help you catch these guys before they vanish into thin air.
- That's not feelings. That's fact.<eos> - Oh, come on, Zeke.<eos> This is where Kyle and I can use the Bureau's resources to help you catch these guys before they vanish into thin air.<eos> We're expanding the net to a ten-state radius, we got APBs out to every government agency, and we got checkpoints on every major highway in every direction for 300 miles.<eos> - You done?
All right. So what?<eos> So maybe they chopped the money then and there, and then went their separate ways.<eos> Or maybe they left two trails to confuse us.<eos> I don't even see how it matters.<eos> Well, you'll see that it matters when we find my brother Andy's dead body, you stupid assholes. Oh!
I don't even see how it matters.<eos> Well, you'll see that it matters when we find my brother Andy's dead body, you stupid assholes. Oh!<eos> Your partner's being real pig-headed about this.<eos> My partner?<eos> My partner's the smartest guy in the room, and if you don't see that, you two are dumber than you look.
Yeah, that could.<eos> Wait, say that again?<eos> No. No, no, no, no, no.<eos> The Camaro is black and the suspects are white.<eos> No, you should. You should definitely cut them loose.
Ed Burton and Andrew Sikes.<eos> The owner of the bank, Judge Dawkins, could not be reached for comment. But it's now clear that Tuesday's dramatic shoot-out at the FMB is anything but over.<eos> As for the victim, Chris Morrow.<eos> Hey!<eos> Listen, you've got to come and get this money out of here and give me that tape.
That's the one.<eos> Well, that connects them. What about, uh.?<eos> - My brother?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You said he knew these other two well.
So he just came back here to get his clothes?<eos> - He wanted me to go with him.<eos> - And you said no?<eos> - I said no.<eos> - You expect us to believe that?
- He wanted me to go with him.<eos> - And you said no?<eos> - I said no.<eos> - You expect us to believe that?<eos> Ed shows up here with $3 million in cash, and you just tell him to get lost?
This is a big deal.<eos> So if it turns out that you're lying, you will end up doin' time.<eos> How much time?<eos> Long enough for you to come out a different person.<eos> Maybe you lose some of those girlish good looks.
So if it turns out that you're lying, you will end up doin' time.<eos> How much time?<eos> Long enough for you to come out a different person.<eos> Maybe you lose some of those girlish good looks.<eos> Maybe you come out an old lady. Hey, maybe you don't come out at all.
Ed isn't much into discussing business with me.<eos> - So what do you think?<eos> - I don't know. What do you think that one more thing was?<eos> Could be Andy.<eos> - You don't think they're together?
Mind if I speak first?<eos> By all means.<eos> Fellas, this here is a local matter.<eos> It's a local crime committed by locals against locals.<eos> Shit, as I'm sure you're aware, one of the guys involved is my own goddamn brother.
In high school, we all played on the same football team.<eos> We all know each other, so.<eos> I assure you, if anybody's capable of catching these guys, catching them before there's any further bloodshed, it's gonna be my partner and I.<eos> That being said, when it comes time to make arrests, you guys feel free to take every ounce of credit.<eos> So, if you don't mind taking a bit of a back seat, we'll be happy to paint you as the heroes.
- Oh, by all means.<eos> Zeke, I appreciate your being frank with us, so I'm gonna go ahead and return the favor. And go ahead and stop me if I say something that rubs you the wrong way, okay?<eos> We understand that what happened here last night is a very serious matter around these parts, but, as far as the Bureau's concerned, it's not exactly 9/11 part two.<eos> If it wasn't for the fact that the bank is federally insured, then we would not be down here messing around in your affairs.<eos> So, if you were expecting a couple of, uh.
Chris?<eos> Chris, Zeke Sikes!<eos> If you're in there.<eos> I'm coming in!<eos> Ma'am, I'm gonna need you to get up!
- Don't. Don't come further.<eos> 'Cause I ain't stupid, okay?<eos> - All right, hold on.<eos> - You people are always calling me names!<eos> - Don't come any further. - But you don't know me!
I have.<eos> Jesus, Judge.<eos> I didn't. I didn't.<eos> What have I. What have I done?<eos> You killed him.
Why did you provoke him?<eos> Just making sure.<eos> - You manipulative little sh.<eos> - Focus, Judge.<eos> You just emptied a machine gun.
All right, where's my tape?<eos> We'll give it to you when we come pick up the bag.<eos> No! I don't want the bag!<eos> I want the tape!<eos> We need you to hold on to the money for a couple days until things cool off a bit.
Judge Dawkins.<eos> Lay it on me, brother.<eos> You've got a lot of nerve blackmailing me twice with the same tape.<eos> Yeah, I don't know. It just kinda felt like a two-chit tape.<eos> You know, now, especially. I hear you're running for the Senate.
You know, now, especially. I hear you're running for the Senate.<eos> Burton, if you ever show up flaunting this tape in my face again, I swear to God, I'm gonna.<eos> Relax, hombre, you think I'm gonna care, when I'm drinking piña coladas on some deserted playa, about you and your 19-year-old fucking butt-buddy?<eos> Oh, Jesus fuck!<eos> Whenever you're ready with those digits, Judge.
Trust me. You're gonna be singing a very different tune in a few hours when you're a very rich woman.<eos> All right, where were we, boys?<eos> - Evening, fellas.<eos> - Oh, Sheriff Sikes, my man!<eos> Listen, I can't tell you how grateful I am that you're going to all this trouble to help us out once again.
Thank you.<eos> So, uh, unless there's anything else, I'm just gonna be heading home.<eos> I gotta get home before Allison pitches a fit.<eos> I gotta be there right when dinner is served.<eos> Judge, uh. You wanna.
I gotta be there right when dinner is served.<eos> Judge, uh. You wanna.<eos> Oh! Yeah, sorry.<eos> Hey, listen, just as a point of curiosity, what would happen if someone tried to rob this bank tonight?<eos> You'd shoot 'em, right?
That's awfully kind of you to say, Judge.<eos> Though, hopefully, tonight will just be your typical quiet night at the bank.<eos> Of course.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, I hope you brought a crossword puzzle.
Shit, what's happening?<eos> What the fuck is going on?<eos> - Justice, Ed.<eos> - Justice. Justice for what?<eos> We couldn't just let you get away with it.
I need a lot of cops.<eos> It's just something to numb the pain before we take you to the hospital.<eos> - No, no, I can't.<eos> I'm allergic.<eos> - You have to have something.
Oh, Ringo!<eos> I, Francie. .. Take you, Douglas, as you are... To love and to cherish... to have and to hold...<eos> Until death do us part.<eos> Frances Millner, Douglas Grotsky, take hands.<eos> You may now kiss as husband and wife.
- Why can't a person ask that?<eos> Yeah, I'd like to know.<eos> Okay, then. Okay.<eos> She'd like to know.<eos> So, Walter, what is it that you do?
You okay?<eos> No. Not okay.<eos> I could just see you staring at somebody for a minute.<eos> Like a real, true minute which is a long time to stare.<eos> Tells me you got something brewing up here.
Just say something smug and walk away.<eos> No, it wasn't like that.<eos> I just saw you there, and I...<eos> Yeah, well, it was like that.<eos> Also, in order for you to know that I'd been staring at someone for a real, true minute, you had to be staring at me for a real, true minute.
Yeah.<eos> I guess you did.<eos> Sorry, I'm...<eos> I'm having an off day.<eos> Do you ever have that?
I guess you did.<eos> Sorry, I'm...<eos> I'm having an off day.<eos> Do you ever have that?<eos> Kind of day where you think that the things that come so easy to everyone else just seem so elusive?
Kind of day where you think that the things that come so easy to everyone else just seem so elusive?<eos> No.<eos> Yeah, me neither.<eos> Okay- Okay-<eos> Not that you asked, but this is where I'm sitting so if you end up in the high teens, you know where to find me.
Is what we're calling ourselves.<eos> I'm calling it "The Band."<eos> Eloise, what's your connection to the bride and groom?<eos> Right, yeah, that's the sort of question you ask back here.<eos> It's not gonna be what you want to hear.
Eloise, what's your connection to the bride and groom?<eos> Right, yeah, that's the sort of question you ask back here.<eos> It's not gonna be what you want to hear.<eos> It won't be what she wants to hear.<eos> You're Jo Flanagan, right?
It won't be what she wants to hear.<eos> You're Jo Flanagan, right?<eos> You're the nanny. Francie's nanny.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> And you know Henry Grotsky from the diner scene, you're those people...
Oh... Thank you!<eos> There's been a long discussion about what kind of table this is and you've just resolved it!<eos> She is the best friend of the bride.<eos> Well, oldest.<eos> How close to the toilet do you feel now, Mr. Kepp?
I'm a fan of detective fiction, Eloise.<eos> Big, big fan.<eos> So when I find that something doesn't add up, I investigate.<eos> Can't help being a detective, it's just who I am.<eos> And you want to know what rank on the force my husband has attained?
It's no mystery, it's not a big deal.<eos> I got dumped by Francie's brother, Teddy Millner, the best man.<eos> That tall drink of shit over there at table one you can barely see.<eos> God, look at him.<eos> That guy is exactly who you think he'd be.
I'm glad I came.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I feel nothing, actually.<eos> I feel liberated. I feel free.<eos> God. You have no idea what that feels like.
See?<eos> He has a pathological aversion to answering a question directly.<eos> He always answers with another question.<eos> Why did you make Facebook friends with Henry Grotsky on Facebook?<eos> You answered with a question.
I must look very different to you since the last time we saw each other.<eos> O-M-G! Oh!<eos> That's mortifying that I would forget.<eos> Nanny Jo.<eos> Well, you've had a lot on your plate.
Where's Mr. Manny?<eos> Mr. Manny?<eos> A lady at Table 4 says she tries to eat her own weight in purple cabbage every week.<eos> How do I figure out if the kitchen has that much purple cabbage?<eos> I don't know why you're telling me...
Take it.<eos> I'll find Mr. Manny myself.<eos> Oh, come on!<eos> I should go somewhere.<eos> Yeah, I mean... You should be traveling the world. Hmm.
Watch it!<eos> What?<eos> It was lovely to dance with you.<eos> How did I not just get kissed?<eos> It happens more often than you think.
We don't, because we don't know anything about her.<eos> She's temperamental. She hasn't had a drink and now she's puked up mini hotdogs.<eos> Do none of you care that that girl is obviously pregnant?<eos> What? Huh?<eos> You children are such a disappointment.
You children are such a disappointment.<eos> Go away, please.<eos> You're right.<eos> Teddy Millner was always rotten.<eos> You don't know me.
Hello.<eos> Jerry Kepp.<eos> Diner associate on the Grotsky side.<eos> Hello.<eos> Did you or did you not dump this girl after getting her pregnant?
I have a bag of dope in my room.<eos> Room 115 for the dope in case any of you feel that a bag of dope would be fun to do.<eos> Not you.<eos> And not you.<eos> You two can drop by and choose something from the mini fridge.
And not you.<eos> You two can drop by and choose something from the mini fridge.<eos> That was the worst invitation to anything I've ever received, ever.<eos> Is your room this way?<eos> Or are you just following us?
Hello.<eos> My name is Walter and I'm a successful pothead.<eos> I'm smoking the reefer.<eos> Who smokes pot?<eos> Are you a potter?
You know, marriage is till death do us part.<eos> What does that mean? Does that mean you're gonna get to heaven and then you'll be single, and then do whatever you want at that point?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Nobody knows what happens after you die.<eos> You are Romeo and Juliet and we all wish you the same happy ending.
You renamed the family diner after yourself.<eos> That was your idea.<eos> What?<eos> I wanted to be a high school guidance counselor but instead I went to prison.<eos> You made the right decision.
Strangers die all the time, right?<eos> I mean, 150 people die every second.<eos> 150 people right there.<eos> Can't get worked up over it.<eos> You know?
Yeah.<eos> I mean, I know it's too early to know, but... I know.<eos> Well, I have a request.<eos> Don't call her Jo.<eos> I met you today and you think I'm gonna name my daughter after you?
Yeah.<eos> I'm flattered.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> I should just let you know that I've got a little bit of eczema behind my knees.
Goodbye.<eos> I should just let you know that I've got a little bit of eczema behind my knees.<eos> And, um, oh, last year I had a cold sore, but that was because Jalapeno was using my washcloth.<eos> And not just on his face.<eos> But, yeah, otherwise, I'm all fine so just let me know when you want to start the intercourse.
Where are you going?<eos> I gotta go and help with the hors d'oeuvres in the Woodside ballroom.<eos> Why?<eos> Understaffed.<eos> So, you're not the friendliest guy in the world.
It was summer camp.<eos> I was a junior counselor. She was a senior counselor.<eos> Honestly, Renzo, it's no big secret.<eos> Camp does most of the seducing.<eos> Less often than you think.
What if you went away with someone better?<eos> What if I know how to find your wedding crasher?<eos> Go with your gut. Go with your gut.<eos> Go with your gut.<eos> Megan-Ann, Mr. Pfaffler, you probably don't remember me.
We'll work on the wording before you try again.<eos> You're coming with me.<eos> Hello, friend.<eos> Just stay right there.<eos> Is this the guy you meant?
Yeah, baby<eos> Nice bit of cake?<eos> Oh, Nanny Jo, everybody...<eos> Sorry it's taken us so crazy long to get here.<eos> We're so glad you could all make it.
Nice bit of cake?<eos> Oh, Nanny Jo, everybody...<eos> Sorry it's taken us so crazy long to get here.<eos> We're so glad you could all make it.<eos> You're the Kepps, right?
Goodbye.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I don't know how you fixed this, but it really meant a lot.<eos> Well, it's been so great to catch up with you all.<eos> I hope you all got to dance to your heart's content.
Tyler, knock it off.<eos> Okay, egg white omelet for you.<eos> - Honey.<eos> - Yes, ma'am?<eos> You remind me of my daughter.
Silverware.<eos> - Is everybody good here now?<eos> - He's sulking.<eos> I am not.<eos> You know what, can you just bring us side hash browns?
Oh, let me guess, you only have wholemeal?<eos> - From the Outer?<eos> - No, from AMP.<eos> Why don't I just apply it directly to my thighs?<eos> You could use some help.
Frankie, I'm gonna need my phone for one second.<eos> There you go. Let's switch.<eos> Hello?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Can you hold on just one second?
No, I didn't. I'm sorry.<eos> Are you hiding, Frankie?<eos> Frankie. You left your toy.<eos> Are you hiding, Frankie?<eos> - You can't find your son? - No, I can't find him.
Help me! Help me!<eos> Where is he?<eos> Don't let me lose him.<eos> Okay, God, I know I never pray to you unless somebody is sick. Or somebody's dying or in an airplane. But, God, please don't let me lose him.<eos> But if you get me this one thing, God... This one thing... I will never ever ask you for another thing as long as I live.
Pull over!<eos> - Pull the car over now!<eos> - Help me! They got my son!<eos> I'm here, Frankie!<eos> What do you want?
- Pull the car over now!<eos> - Help me! They got my son!<eos> I'm here, Frankie!<eos> What do you want?<eos> What do you people want?
What do you people want?<eos> Money?<eos> There's not a lot of cash in here.<eos> But all my credit cards are in here too.<eos> So you can get all the money I have.
But all my credit cards are in here too.<eos> So you can get all the money I have.<eos> My PIN number is 1015.<eos> Here.<eos> If you let him out of that car, I will stop chasing you.
All I want is my son.<eos> That's all I care about.<eos> If the cops asked, I haven't seen your face.<eos> I don't know your license plate.<eos> You can get away.
You can get away.<eos> If they asked me, I won't know anything.<eos> Let me tell you something.<eos> As long as my son is in that car I will not stop.<eos> Wherever you go I will be right behind you.
- Mommy!<eos> - Frankie.<eos> Karla, unlock the door.<eos> What do you want?<eos> You got $10,000?
Karla, unlock the door.<eos> What do you want?<eos> You got $10,000?<eos> I'm gonna ride with you, your son is gonna ride with him and we're gonna go get that money.<eos> Or you're gonna kill me.
Or you're gonna kill me.<eos> That's what he wants.<eos> What he wants me to do.<eos> But I told him for $10,000, we can make a new plan.<eos> You want your boy and I want $10,000.
Unlock the door.<eos> I'm trying to save your child.<eos> Open the door before he changes his mind.<eos> Come on.<eos> You want him to kill your son?
You want him to kill your son?<eos> Follow him.<eos> Where do I go?<eos> Just keep going straight, I'll tell you where to go.<eos> After we get the money, I'll give him a call and you'll get your boy back.
Last seen wearing a blue and red shirt.<eos> Responds to Frankie Dyson.<eos> The mother is here with me at the station.<eos> Do you have a cellphone that I can use so if I go out there I can call and stay in touch with you?<eos> No, ma'am. But you can use that phone right over on that wall.
Okay, my husband, yes.<eos> - I need to call my husband.<eos> - 9 in the area code.<eos> I've put out an APP for Jefferson Parish.<eos> You just need to wait, Karla.
That's a long time.<eos> It's alright, ma'am.<eos> The police are on their way.<eos> I need you to get to a safe place, stay here on the line with me now, okay?<eos> Would you let me know when you find a safe place to hide?
Come on, honey. I'm here to help you.<eos> It's okay.<eos> What the hell is going on here?<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> - Who are you?
- Right there.<eos> Right there?<eos> Is this the only one?<eos> All right.<eos> You could go over there, you could go the fuck over there, get the fuck out of here!
Right there?<eos> Is this the only one?<eos> All right.<eos> You could go over there, you could go the fuck over there, get the fuck out of here!<eos> What part of "private" do you not understand?
My God, I am so sorry.<eos> Frankie, stop.<eos> Don't you know he's a friend?<eos> What a terrible, terrible way to meet.<eos> - You're Lieutenant Buchannon, right?
- You're Lieutenant Buchannon, right?<eos> - I am.<eos> Victoria Leeds, the new owner of the Huntley Club.<eos> Of course.<eos> I know exactly who you are.
I know exactly who you are.<eos> - Well, welcome to Emerald Bay.<eos> - Thank you so much.<eos> I heard you were a head-turner. What an understatement that is.<eos> And I heard you were a charmer.
And I heard you were a charmer.<eos> Guess that's an understatement, too.<eos> I apologize for Frankie.<eos> I know this beach is public and, honestly, I wish the club was, too.<eos> - But you, you're welcome anytime.
- He died.<eos> - R.I.P.<eos> Are you guys being serious right now?<eos> I honestly can't tell.<eos> You show up here, matching bathing suits.
No, fresh out.<eos> Fresh out of fucks.<eos> Okay, that ocean out there has riptides that'll tear your little mangina in two.<eos> My mangina?<eos> So you are being serious.
You're big, Sasquatch.<eos> But I'm fast.<eos> Really fucking fast.<eos> Which is why somebody important thinks I belong here.<eos> So when you two figure out who the fuck I am, you can find me on the beach.
Fuck you, Dave.<eos> You're my worst friend.<eos> Captain, I need to talk to you about this...<eos> Yeah, Mitch.<eos> Look, you're just in time.
You're my worst friend.<eos> Captain, I need to talk to you about this...<eos> Yeah, Mitch.<eos> Look, you're just in time.<eos> I want you to watch something.
Matt Brody, U.S. swimmer, sex symbol and adrenaline junkie.<eos> How do I define myself?<eos> 80% trill and 30% dope.<eos> People think I'm crazy, that I'm out of control.<eos> How do you think I got all this gold?
There's no "I" in "team."<eos> But there is a "me."<eos> Are you dyslexic?<eos> I'm Caucasian.<eos> This is the guy you think is a good PR opportunity for us?
Brody is an American hero with the face of a Swedish model.<eos> You're losing me.<eos> He's one of the best swimmers in the whole world.<eos> There's more to this job than just swimming.<eos> - You know that.
Good work, Mitch.<eos> I'll turn this over to the police.<eos> Hey, look.<eos> This new guy of yours? He's not ready for this kind of trouble.<eos> He doesn't need to be, and neither do you.
He doesn't need to be, and neither do you.<eos> Okay?<eos> It's not your job.<eos> It's the busiest time of the year.<eos> I need you out there shining for me.
Most of the council has signed off on your terms.<eos> Good.<eos> And the rest are almost there.<eos> "Almost"?<eos> Councilman, you seem like the kind of man who knows how to seize an opportunity.
You work in an office and you doze off at your desk one day, no big deal.<eos> You slack off here...<eos> Say it with me...<eos> People die.<eos> So here's the thing, if you've come to Baywatch on your little motorcycle, thinking you're cool, trying to work on your killer tan...
Say it with me...<eos> People die.<eos> So here's the thing, if you've come to Baywatch on your little motorcycle, thinking you're cool, trying to work on your killer tan...<eos> Well, you need to find another beach to go to.<eos> But if you've come to sacrifice for something much bigger than yourself, this is the beach for you.
People die.<eos> So here's the thing, if you've come to Baywatch on your little motorcycle, thinking you're cool, trying to work on your killer tan...<eos> Well, you need to find another beach to go to.<eos> But if you've come to sacrifice for something much bigger than yourself, this is the beach for you.<eos> But you're gonna have to get through this first.
"The Absentee Father."<eos> He's tough.<eos> Brutal, even.<eos> His presence in your life is brief, but it will scar you and instill a toughness in you that will carry you through birthdays,<eos> Christmases and even "Bring Your Dad To School Day" when your mom has to put on a fake moustache just so you can fit in with the other kids.
- Come on, let's go!<eos> - Listen to what she's saying.<eos> Keep it going!<eos> Keep it going!<eos> You are guppies!
Come on, guys!<eos> Come on, guys! Let's go!<eos> Hustle, hustle, hustle!<eos> Let's go!<eos> You got this!
Don't jack off on my sheets.<eos> Don't.<eos> I can't find my hermit crab.<eos> I think he ran out earlier today.<eos> He's got short legs, but he's got a fast walk, so, if you'd keep eyes open, I'd appreciate that.
Just some property owners won't give approval.<eos> But I'm working on it.<eos> Yeah, well, you just ran out of time.<eos> Leon, would you show Mr. Rodriguez what we do to people who don't deliver?<eos> I know you're dealing flakka, which is gonna drive down real estate prices in the bay, right? Right?
And then you'll never get your approvals.<eos> Such accusations.<eos> I'm not a Bond villain.<eos> Well, yet.<eos> You're in politics.
Such accusations.<eos> I'm not a Bond villain.<eos> Well, yet.<eos> You're in politics.<eos> You know that no one can claw their way to the top without getting a little dirt under their fingernails.
You're in politics.<eos> You know that no one can claw their way to the top without getting a little dirt under their fingernails.<eos> Clearly, I overestimated you.<eos> But calling me a drug dealer...<eos> It's so much bigger than that, you know?
- We would have died?<eos> - Burned to a crisp.<eos> - I'm not ready to die!<eos> I know.<eos> It's okay, you're not.
But that doesn't mean that there's anything sinister going on.<eos> Okay? And even if there was, that's not our job. That's not what we do.<eos> We're lifeguards.<eos> So, this, technically, has nothing to do with us.<eos> You just heard that cop.
This dude is not rich at all.<eos> All his money is tied up in real estate in the bay.<eos> Well, I guess you'll have to help me persuade him some other way.<eos> Every man has a price.<eos> Speaking of which, I know you've been using my special set of skills for your own nefarious purposes, but additional compensation would go a long way in motivating me to keep my mouth shut.
- Brody?<eos> - What?<eos> - You're our lookout.<eos> - Lookout?<eos> Guys, if you want to find drugs at a party, I can walk in there and find drugs.
Hey, am I the only one that thinks this is clearly a job for the police?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Fuck it.<eos> Mr. Chen, I'm so glad you could make it.
Mr. Chen, I'm so glad you could make it.<eos> I wanted to meet the new neighbor everyone is talking about.<eos> So I presume you know why I had to invite you.<eos> I am not interested in selling my properties.<eos> Why don't you think about it, okay?
So where should I, like, look out from?<eos> Hey.<eos> How are you?<eos> Victoria.<eos> You killed Rodriguez in front of witnesses.
Okay.<eos> My bad.<eos> Except for there's no fucking such thing as "lifeguard pursuit"!<eos> Police do pursuits!<eos> When you do it, it's just some guys chasing some other guys.
You don't get to say that.<eos> You're just tan.<eos> - Right on.<eos> - Come on, brother.<eos> Look, even if you were police, which you're not, and even if this was your jurisdiction, which it isn't, and even if you had probable cause to pursue, which you definitely don't,
You're just tan.<eos> - Right on.<eos> - Come on, brother.<eos> Look, even if you were police, which you're not, and even if this was your jurisdiction, which it isn't, and even if you had probable cause to pursue, which you definitely don't,<eos> what you did would still be totally illegal.
what you did would still be totally illegal.<eos> Okay, well, I mean, it's a good thing we're not police, then.<eos> It's like you purposely only hear 1% of what I say.<eos> Mitch, did you pull Brody off the beach to break into the medical examiner's office earlier today?<eos> Yeah, you bet I did.
The Councilman's boating accident was no accident at all.<eos> He had no smoke in his lungs, his neck was broken in multiple places.<eos> Which means he was probably dead before that boat even caught on fire.<eos> And our investigation has found that all of this shady shit leads right back to the Huntley.<eos> You don't do investigations.

And our investigation has found that all of this shady shit leads right back to the Huntley.<eos> You don't do investigations.<eos> You're lifeguards.<eos> Police do investigations.<eos> When you do it, it's just a bunch of guys investigating another bunch of guys.
Yeah, and I recorded the whole thing on my cell phone.<eos> - Where's the cell phone?<eos> - They destroyed it.<eos> Okay.<eos> So the only evidence that you had was destroyed.
All right, now, look.<eos> Leave law enforcement to the police.<eos> Okay?<eos> And you guys just do the jobs that I hired you to do.<eos> You remember?
- and find the flakka.<eos> - I warned you.<eos> I warned you about sticking to your job.<eos> This wasn't even Mitch's fault.<eos> You leave me no choice.
I hope you haven't gone crazy and started eating carbs or something.<eos> Everyone says hi.<eos> Come back, man.<eos> I could really use your help, brother.<eos> You know, well, it all depends on the data plan that you want.
Shit!<eos> Hey.<eos> No guests allowed upstairs.<eos> Then I guess that means that you and I are all alone.<eos> And you look like a bad boy.
God...<eos> Fuck!<eos> No!<eos> You have to listen to me!<eos> You're fucking crazy.
You're fucking crazy.<eos> If I was a man, you'd call me "driven."<eos> - No!<eos> - Let's go, boys.<eos> You have to listen to me!
For fuck's sake.<eos> Why don't you die already?<eos> Let the little boy go.<eos> That's not how this story ends, Mitch.<eos> You see, you're not here to save him.
Let the little boy go.<eos> That's not how this story ends, Mitch.<eos> You see, you're not here to save him.<eos> After all, he took your job.<eos> So you shot him.
But not before he got a shot off that killed you.<eos> I don't know.<eos> That seems a little complicated.<eos> Yeah, that sounds cheesy.<eos> You won't get away with this!
- My man.<eos> - My man.<eos> Hey!<eos> What part of "You're fired" do you not understand, Mitch?<eos> Get the fuck off my beach or I'll have you arrested.
Get the fuck off my beach or I'll have you arrested.<eos> Hey, Thorpe.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> This is our beach, bitch.<eos> And you're under arrest.
You only threw it eight feet, dude.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> You're very welcome.<eos> Guys, after finding the drugs, helping save Chen and helping me blow up the bad girl with a Roman candle, it's a pleasure to say you are officially no longer trainees.
Maybe for you there's a tomorrow.<eos> Maybe for you there's 1,000 or 3,000 or 10.<eos> So much time you can bathe in it.
Maybe for you there's a tomorrow.<eos> Maybe for you there's 1,000 or 3,000 or 10.<eos> So much time you can bathe in it.<eos> So much time you can waste it.
Maybe for you there's 1,000 or 3,000 or 10.<eos> So much time you can bathe in it.<eos> So much time you can waste it.<eos> But for some of us, there's only today.<eos> And what you do today matters.
But for some of us, there's only today.<eos> And what you do today matters.<eos> In the moment, and maybe into infinity.<eos> But I didn't know any of that until right before I fell.<eos> The thing is, you don't get to know.

Lexicon?<eos> Nice word choice.<eos> Come on.<eos> Seriously?<eos> Okay, this was maybe funny the first bazillion times you did it.
No, I'm eating!<eos> Get out!<eos> Go.<eos> Bye.<eos> You all are too cute.
Yeah.<eos> Tonight, everything changes.<eos> That face.<eos> Baes!<eos> What are you doing?
What?<eos> Oh, she's so shitfaced!<eos> No, you're shitfaced, shitface.<eos> I can't believe high school's almost over.<eos> Well, actually, we did it right, you know?
I don't know.<eos> She just called us bitches...<eos> What did she do?<eos> In front of everybody.<eos> So you attack her? Okay.
What did she do?<eos> In front of everybody.<eos> So you attack her? Okay.<eos> This is not my fault!<eos> You gang up and pour beer all over her?
Nope, no time.<eos> Come on.<eos> It's Cupid Day.<eos> Seriously?<eos> Okay, this was maybe funny the first bazillion times you did it.
Were you with Rob, you hussy?<eos> Skank.<eos> Harlot.<eos> Hey, are you guys talking about me?<eos> You know what?
Okay, okay, let's hope third time's the charm. Okay?<eos> Sisyphus.<eos> Sam!<eos> What?<eos> You can take 'em.
You're not.<eos> My patience, however, is at its breaking point.<eos> Take a seat.<eos> Please.<eos> If you insist.
I used to sleep over at her house.<eos> Her parents would be fighting so bad.<eos> She was so upset.<eos> She was so upset, she started wetting the bed.<eos> You remember the name you all gave me in fifth grade?
I think I can and I think I just did.<eos> I should've picked Elody.<eos> What just happened?<eos> You guys were supposed to...<eos> I mean, you said you wanted to...
Juliet, stop!<eos> Maybe for you there's a tomorrow.<eos> Maybe for you there's 1,000 or 3,000 or 10.<eos> But for some of us, there's only today.<eos> And what you do today matters.
It's a Red Retriever.<eos> Nice dog.<eos> Good breed.<eos> Easy to train.<eos> You got something smaller?
Good boy.<eos> Please, Dad?<eos> Come on.<eos> He needs a pal.<eos> All right, this thing that you two are doing?
Why can't everything smell like goat?<eos> Oh, it stinks!<eos> Oh, boy, look who's here.<eos> Guess what we got!<eos> What have you got?
Yeah.<eos> Well, we're happy to have you.<eos> Um, so, I've been meaning to say we're real impressed with your numbers this past year, Jim.<eos> Real impressed.<eos> You know, I'm glad you brought that up.
I was thinking, with the numbers so high, maybe it's time I get off the road and take an office position.<eos> Well, we really need you on the road.<eos> That's the backbone of the whole operation, really.<eos> I'll be honest, Jim.<eos> You are one of our best traveling salesmen.
Lethargic.<eos> So he doesn't wanna go for walks anymore?<eos> I had to carry him into the car.<eos> What can we do for him, doctor?<eos> What do you think?
Dr. Joyce, can I use your phone?<eos> Yes, absolutely.<eos> Doctor...<eos> If this was a person...<eos> You're the veterinarian.
Not so into you now, is she?<eos> I never went anywhere.<eos> I never played.<eos> It was like the days went on and on without me.<eos> You have 30 days to deal with this.
It's actually a pretty interesting town.<eos> Oh, okay, that flies in the face of everything I've ever heard... about St. Louis in particular and Missouri at large!<eos> What the hell do you know about it?<eos> Look, I get it.<eos> You don't want to have to be the ones to cart poor old... Wilson to the hospital when he conks out.
Dad?<eos> Something?<eos> It's too late, isn't it?<eos> There it is.<eos> You have any kids of your own?
It's too late, isn't it?<eos> There it is.<eos> You have any kids of your own?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Do... you... have any niños of your own?
Excuse me?<eos> Do... you... have any niños of your own?<eos> Two.<eos> But they grown up.<eos> Hell of a job doing what you do.
My...<eos> I'm just not used to this car.<eos> It's actually okay.<eos> It's fine.<eos> Well, it looks like you have maybe a crack or a crease or a dent.
It looked like he did it on purpose.<eos> It's fine, okay?<eos> It's fine. Thank you.<eos> But excuse me!<eos> Before you go, um...
Thank you.<eos> Excuse me, sir?<eos> Just a second.<eos> Watch the door.<eos> Quick question: Can you tell me where a guy could find some pussy in this town?
Excuse me, sir?<eos> Just a second.<eos> Watch the door.<eos> Quick question: Can you tell me where a guy could find some pussy in this town?<eos> Oh, you're looking for a strip club, huh?
Where the hell's that goddamn file?<eos> Cocksucker!<eos> Oh, here's what I got.<eos> "Claire Cassiday, Parker Day High School."<eos> You sure about that?
Yeah.<eos> You know, that's...<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You're a wise man.
Pippi?<eos> They grow up so fast.<eos> Fuck you!<eos> What a day!<eos> Can you imagine... how much bird feces is in this park?
Coop's heading to Duke in the fall.<eos> It's hard to believe.<eos> Coops!<eos> And Jenny's already halfway through law school.<eos> Oh, Christ, I forgot you had another one.
Definite college material.<eos> What are you gonna major in, brain surgery?<eos> So, Claire, have you been thinking about school yet?<eos> Fuck, no.<eos> You see?
No, I'm not...<eos> I like it.<eos> It's like an acknowledgement to a whole other generation...<eos> Hi.<eos> It doesn't matter if you're out of here 20 years, living on an island.
I like it.<eos> It's like an acknowledgement to a whole other generation...<eos> Hi.<eos> It doesn't matter if you're out of here 20 years, living on an island.<eos> You will never be truly free until you've been washed in the blood of the Lamb.
I thought she might be interested in her family tree, and there's photos.<eos> Yeah, well, we don't want you or your book.<eos> I'm asking you. Go home.<eos> I gave you a chance to raise this wonderful girl.<eos> If you love her, then... you love a little piece of me, too.
I gave you a chance to raise this wonderful girl.<eos> If you love her, then... you love a little piece of me, too.<eos> That's it.<eos> I'm calling the cops.<eos> You have everything in the world!
Yeah, I have an intruder on my property.<eos> Yes, I will.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Thanks for taking care of my baby.<eos> You... did an amazing job.
Light!<eos> Where would we be without Merlin and the Mages who helped him?<eos> Where are they now?<eos> Why do they not show themselves?<eos> You know where they are, Lord Mercia.
Look after him.<eos> I'll see you tomorrow.<eos> Are the men ready?<eos> Yes, they are.<eos> Are you sure about this, my Lord?
A young boy.<eos> Your boy.<eos> Blue Boy.<eos> And he's a good boy.<eos> Oi! What are you lot doing?
- My Lucy?<eos> - That can't happen, Jack.<eos> That can never happen, Jack.<eos> You see, she's a friend of mine.<eos> So you're gonna have to sort her out.
They had to pay.<eos> How'd you get money from a Viking?<eos> I feel a joke coming on here.<eos> You ask him for it.<eos> You're paying and then you're leaving.
She's from one of the oldest families in England.<eos> She can tell us.<eos> Sire.<eos> Do the people love me?<eos> I love Your Majesty, and if I represent the people, then you have your answer.
Right, ten digits round the blunt bit. Give it a tug.<eos> Left foot, right foot.<eos> Collect your brand.<eos> Back on the barge.<eos> That's everything you know about him?
How unfortunate it was at the expense of my Viking guests.<eos> King Vortigern! King Vortigern! King Vortigern!<eos> Behold, your born king.<eos> Behold the man who pulled sword from stone.<eos> You wanted a prophecy.
They have a word for that, don't they?<eos> "Mage."<eos> I thought your team was outlawed.<eos> Never met one of you in the flesh.<eos> I thought you'd be taller.
I thought your team was outlawed.<eos> Never met one of you in the flesh.<eos> I thought you'd be taller.<eos> And have a beard.<eos> You do know I can see through this?
You know, I'm a little old for finger-wagging and speeches.<eos> So, unless you're my dad, which, I believe, is unlikely, can you just get around to telling me exactly what it is you want?<eos> What is it that you want?<eos> I want to get my arse out of here and see what's left of my life and the people in it.<eos> But you're not gonna let me do that, are you?
What is it that you want?<eos> I want to get my arse out of here and see what's left of my life and the people in it.<eos> But you're not gonna let me do that, are you?<eos> And why aren't we?<eos> You just lost two men.
I want to get my arse out of here and see what's left of my life and the people in it.<eos> But you're not gonna let me do that, are you?<eos> And why aren't we?<eos> You just lost two men.<eos> But you were prepared to lose five to save this pretty neck.
Like it or not, this is your lot.<eos> And even we don't like you.<eos> Do we, Goosefat?<eos> But what we are interested in is what you can do with this sword.<eos> Why don't you leave him with me for a minute or two, boss?
Put your ring back on, honey tits.<eos> You haven't had enough porridge this morning to talk like that.<eos> And if you like that sword so much, Your Lordship, you can keep it to peel your grapes.<eos> Now that would've hurt a lot more if I left the ring on.<eos> I see what you're doing.
You haven't had enough porridge this morning to talk like that.<eos> And if you like that sword so much, Your Lordship, you can keep it to peel your grapes.<eos> Now that would've hurt a lot more if I left the ring on.<eos> I see what you're doing.<eos> You're trying to get me to do something razzle-dazzle with that sword.
Wait here, son.<eos> Run, son!<eos> You are resisting the sword.<eos> The sword isn't resisting you.<eos> It should be clear by now that whatever it is that you and your friends think you want from me,
We can arrange a meeting with six of those families...<eos> Let me stop you there.<eos> If I may, allow me to run you through the proceedings as I think they will unfold.<eos> They'll start by telling us...<eos> If you're intending to galvanize the people of this country against the current king, there has to be a realistic strategy.
"Knights of the Bordello"?<eos> Or "The Ladies of the Knight."<eos> Have you finished?<eos> I'm gonna have to pull 'em on it.<eos> I'm glad you've got a sense of humor.
Or "The Ladies of the Knight."<eos> Have you finished?<eos> I'm gonna have to pull 'em on it.<eos> I'm glad you've got a sense of humor.<eos> 'Cause you're gonna need it.
I'm glad you've got a sense of humor.<eos> 'Cause you're gonna need it.<eos> I'm gonna be forced to tell them...<eos> There's not a bollock between you.<eos> At which point, Bedivere, you're gonna get very angry, and tell me off.
'Cause you're gonna need it.<eos> I'm gonna be forced to tell them...<eos> There's not a bollock between you.<eos> At which point, Bedivere, you're gonna get very angry, and tell me off.<eos> You'll say something along the lines of,
"I was never gonna fight."<eos> And you're gonna say, "Well, what was gonna happen?"<eos> And I was gonna say, "That's what you're here for, Bedivere,"<eos> "you big, silly, posh bastard."<eos> You want Vortigern to stick his neck out and get him to Londinium?
And you're gonna say, "Well, what was gonna happen?"<eos> And I was gonna say, "That's what you're here for, Bedivere,"<eos> "you big, silly, posh bastard."<eos> You want Vortigern to stick his neck out and get him to Londinium?<eos> You need to tease it out.
You need to tease it out.<eos> You don't need 12,000 fighting men for that.<eos> What you need is this little rabble.<eos> Okay, so how's that gonna work?<eos> If I'm moving too fast for you, Bedivere, you can let yourself out the side door.
What you need is this little rabble.<eos> Okay, so how's that gonna work?<eos> If I'm moving too fast for you, Bedivere, you can let yourself out the side door.<eos> You seem to have found your way very quickly.<eos> Now, come on, kid. You're cooking dinner.
What a waste of brandy.<eos> But doesn't it make the palace burn well?<eos> 10,000 boys. All under 12 years.<eos> Young enough to forget their families, and to have no other loyalty than to you.<eos> Plus, 5,000 more each year for as long as you grant us passage through your seas.
Are the boys yours to give?<eos> Do you really consider your faith better served by a rumor?<eos> Or by the word of the conqueror of this island with an army of 100,000 souls behind his sword?<eos> I meant no disrespect, Great King.<eos> You asked to see me, Father?
We all look away.<eos> But that is the difference between a man and a king.<eos> Maggie!<eos> I thought we agreed that you'd never come here.<eos> You need to hear this.
- He will travel by barge.<eos> - When?<eos> - Three days from now. - Hmm.<eos> Looks like your plan worked.<eos> You need to be careful.
Tell him.<eos> Tell you what the problem is, mate.<eos> When you say the building's right, I know the man that owns that building.<eos> And he's not interested in letting anyone in.<eos> How do you feel about a rooftop king assassination?
We need to go. Now!<eos> Now. We need to go now.<eos> Put your arms up.<eos> Hello, boys. Wait, wait.<eos> Hey, hey, hey. Where are you going?
I can't leave him!<eos> Have a look at this situation, would ya?<eos> The king of all England himself has made the effort to visit a commoner.<eos> A man from nowhere, and today, my last day.<eos> You look well, and I feel poor.
I thought you said you weren't gonna push me.<eos> Come on, lads. Chop, chop.<eos> Blue!<eos> - Blue! - Hello!<eos> You took your time getting here.
Let's think...<eos> "Be at the castle before dark"<eos> "if you wanna see the girl and the boy"<eos> "alive."<eos> I would love to stay and chat, but you do understand the situation between me and my wife.
"Be at the castle before dark"<eos> "if you wanna see the girl and the boy"<eos> "alive."<eos> I would love to stay and chat, but you do understand the situation between me and my wife.<eos> Anything that you do to me will be repaid 10 times in kind.
Father, what's happening?<eos> Leave.<eos> Why is there blood on your face?<eos> What's going on?<eos> Father, you're scaring me.
You don't need to run anymore.<eos> You don't need to look away.<eos> The sword is yours, son.<eos> Take it.<eos> You wanted to know what gave me such drive?
The sword is yours, son.<eos> Take it.<eos> You wanted to know what gave me such drive?<eos> It was you.<eos> You put me in that brothel.
Take it.<eos> You wanted to know what gave me such drive?<eos> It was you.<eos> You put me in that brothel.<eos> You cut me on the streets.
It was you.<eos> You put me in that brothel.<eos> You cut me on the streets.<eos> I am here now because of you.<eos> You created me.
You cut me on the streets.<eos> I am here now because of you.<eos> You created me.<eos> And, for that, I bless you.<eos> You make sense of the devil.
Light!<eos> Ready!<eos> Loose!<eos> While I understand there's been a change in the leadership of this nation,<eos> I am confident that you will still honor the agreement made by your predecessor and my king.
May I remind you, a fleet of 3,000 longships controlling the seas, surrounding your island.<eos> It would be unwise to displease my king.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> George, Wet Stick, Percy, on your knees.<eos> Sir Bedivere, if you would?
Sir Bedivere, if you would?<eos> I'm prepared to extend the deadline by a week.<eos> No.<eos> I mean, I'm sorry.<eos> You've made a mistake.
I'm prepared to extend the deadline by a week.<eos> No.<eos> I mean, I'm sorry.<eos> You've made a mistake.<eos> You're no longer dealing with the man you previously met.
No.<eos> I mean, I'm sorry.<eos> You've made a mistake.<eos> You're no longer dealing with the man you previously met.<eos> You are addressing England and all the subjects under her king's protection.
You've made a mistake.<eos> You're no longer dealing with the man you previously met.<eos> You are addressing England and all the subjects under her king's protection.<eos> Arise, Sir George.<eos> So you have a choice.
You're no longer dealing with the man you previously met.<eos> You are addressing England and all the subjects under her king's protection.<eos> Arise, Sir George.<eos> So you have a choice.<eos> You can now kneel to England...
Arise, Sir Tristan.<eos> ...or I'll step off this throne, and you can deal with me as the man you previously met.<eos> Arise, Sir Percival.<eos> And we can see how that goes.<eos> Sir William, if you would?
Vincent Downs, Homicide.<eos> Jennifer Bryant.<eos> That's my partner, Doug Dennison.<eos> We're internal affairs.<eos> Okay. So that's all you got, huh?
And whatever you aiming at, make sure you prepared to kill it.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Mr. Downs, this is Stan Rubino.<eos> I learned you have something that's mine.<eos> The 25 kilos of cocaine you stole.
I learned you have something that's mine.<eos> The 25 kilos of cocaine you stole.<eos> Listen, that was a mistake.<eos> I'll get you your product.<eos> Look, if you hurt him...
The 25 kilos of cocaine you stole.<eos> Listen, that was a mistake.<eos> I'll get you your product.<eos> Look, if you hurt him...<eos> You know what it is.
I'm sorry.<eos> I was with this girl in Agua Prieta, all right?<eos> And the DEA, they busted us and they asked me all these questions.<eos> You know what my father always said about your side of the family?<eos> You only think with your dick.
This is the men's room.<eos> Okay. Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> There was a guy banging around just like you in that one.<eos> You should have said he was black, 6-feet-tall, banging around in the stalls.
Okay. Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> There was a guy banging around just like you in that one.<eos> You should have said he was black, 6-feet-tall, banging around in the stalls.<eos> Then I would have known who you were talking about.
Okay.<eos> Can you hold one moment, please? Thank you.<eos> I'd like to rent a locker, please?<eos> I'm sorry. Lockers are reserved for spa guests only.<eos> If you'd like to book a...
Yeah. Listen.<eos> I gotta call you right back. Vin?<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Dena?<eos> You have one new message.
Sure, look around.<eos> I can't stay, I'm afraid.<eos> I was on my way out.<eos> Oh, no, that's okay.<eos> It's probably better if you're not here. Hey, listen.
Oh, no, that's okay.<eos> It's probably better if you're not here. Hey, listen.<eos> The house is a real mess, especially the kitchen.<eos> Oh, I'll take care of it.<eos> I'll tell them you had guests.
All right.<eos> - See you then.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Cool.<eos> - Hope you like what you see.
- You still wanna buy me lunch? - Of course.<eos> It's my way of keeping you motivated.<eos> Actually, I can only stay a few minutes.<eos> I had to commit to another appointment.<eos> If you'd been here just five minutes earlier...
But listen let's talk about real estate and selling my house instead.<eos> The Owens are not interested, so, what is the next step?<eos> I'm not sure. Wait.<eos> I'm not supposed to say that.<eos> No, no, you're just being honest.
I'm not supposed to say that.<eos> No, no, you're just being honest.<eos> Yeah, I haven't been doing this very long.<eos> Can you tell?<eos> Actually, you're my first.
No, it's not okay.<eos> I'm sure I can get another appointment in a couple weeks.<eos> - How long can you hold out?<eos> - Couple of weeks.<eos> So do you think it's gonna take a long time?
- Summer?<eos> - Well, with the tourists and...<eos> - That was you back there, right?<eos> - What?<eos> You know that guy? - Hey, hey, hey.
Where are you going?<eos> Just drop me wherever suits you.<eos> I'm Paul.<eos> Jack.<eos> You hunt?
I'm Paul.<eos> Jack.<eos> You hunt?<eos> Yeah, I got a goose this morning, yeah.<eos> - What do you do?
In the fight back there, what did you say to that guy?<eos> - What did I say?<eos> - Yeah, the man was terrified.<eos> I told him I liked my lunch quiet.<eos> So you gonna tell me where you're going?
- Yeah, the man was terrified.<eos> I told him I liked my lunch quiet.<eos> So you gonna tell me where you're going?<eos> Just enjoying the road.<eos> You like living like that?
So you gonna tell me where you're going?<eos> Just enjoying the road.<eos> You like living like that?<eos> Nothing better.<eos> How do you get by?
You like living like that?<eos> Nothing better.<eos> How do you get by?<eos> I do what I have to do. Then I move on.<eos> Nothing you miss?
I don't wanna drop you on the road with this weather coming out there.<eos> The weather, man.<eos> They always get it wrong.<eos> Well, we are close to my place, and I got a guest room.<eos> You can use it for the night, have a hot shower.
The weather, man.<eos> They always get it wrong.<eos> Well, we are close to my place, and I got a guest room.<eos> You can use it for the night, have a hot shower.<eos> Look, don't feel like you owe me, okay?
It's the least I can do.<eos> I would be at the hospital without you back there.<eos> Appreciate it.<eos> Here we are.<eos> - You like it?
Appreciate it.<eos> Here we are.<eos> - You like it?<eos> - Yeah, I like it. Good.<eos> You must have sold a lot of books.
It is messed up.<eos> You gotta be careful.<eos> There.<eos> Sorry, maid's day off.<eos> You have a maid?
Bathroom is over there, and it has a shower.<eos> Sheets and towels in the closet.<eos> - Thanks, Paul.<eos> - Yeah, make yourself comfortable.<eos> You have cleaned up.
Sheets and towels in the closet.<eos> - Thanks, Paul.<eos> - Yeah, make yourself comfortable.<eos> You have cleaned up.<eos> You hungry?
You don't have to fix anything.<eos> - Paul, I want to.<eos> - I'm moving.<eos> I need to sell this place.<eos> Why would you give all this up?
Phone is still not working.<eos> No Internet.<eos> Fuck it.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You don't need 'em.
- Yeah.<eos> - You don't need 'em.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Anyway, I thought a writer would actually appreciate being cut off from the world.<eos> You know?
Thank you.<eos> So tomorrow I'm gonna start working the shed.<eos> Needs a new coat of paint.<eos> And there's some tiles on your roof that need fixing.<eos> You'll never have time to do all that in three days, Jack.
I married the woman of my dreams, I had money an apartment in the Wilshire Corridor, you know, tons of needy friends and it all went away.<eos> Even the woman.<eos> We're all free men.<eos> We choose what we want.<eos> - You did this to yourself.
- You did this to yourself.<eos> - Well, no, all I choose was this place.<eos> I told my wife it would help, you know, I needed isolation to write and that was my sacrifice!<eos> All writing is sacrifice.<eos> You know, in most movies I see the characters are just what they are, characters in a movie.
Very hard to catch.<eos> - Ironic, really.<eos> - Ironic?<eos> Yeah, I had it done in prison.<eos> You looking for these?
- Ironic?<eos> Yeah, I had it done in prison.<eos> You looking for these?<eos> I needed to work on the shed, I had to unlock it.<eos> You gonna work today?
You gonna work today?<eos> No.<eos> I'm not in the right frame of mind, and I have to sell this house.<eos> Hard to work when you got to worry about money.<eos> You know you have to do yourself a favor.
I'm not in the right frame of mind, and I have to sell this house.<eos> Hard to work when you got to worry about money.<eos> You know you have to do yourself a favor.<eos> What is that?<eos> You know you have to stop drinking.
Hard to work when you got to worry about money.<eos> You know you have to do yourself a favor.<eos> What is that?<eos> You know you have to stop drinking.<eos> I mean, you gotta stop it cold.
You know you have to do yourself a favor.<eos> What is that?<eos> You know you have to stop drinking.<eos> I mean, you gotta stop it cold.<eos> You could be a great writer.
You know you have to stop drinking.<eos> I mean, you gotta stop it cold.<eos> You could be a great writer.<eos> But your stories are not good enough, and it's because of your drinking.<eos> You know, I think you just need a good idea to jumpstart your career.
I mean, you gotta stop it cold.<eos> You could be a great writer.<eos> But your stories are not good enough, and it's because of your drinking.<eos> You know, I think you just need a good idea to jumpstart your career.<eos> You know, I was thinking this morning, I got an idea.
You know, I think you just need a good idea to jumpstart your career.<eos> You know, I was thinking this morning, I got an idea.<eos> - Of course you do.<eos> - No, really.<eos> I mean, I want you to hear it.
Yeah.<eos> It's a good start.<eos> Go on.<eos> You're the writer, man.<eos> You write it.
It's a good start.<eos> Go on.<eos> You're the writer, man.<eos> You write it.<eos> But you gotta be committed.
You write it.<eos> But you gotta be committed.<eos> Okay, sure, yeah.<eos> When do you think you'll be done?<eos> Who said you could read the script?
Then Jack takes off down the road.<eos> And then later the writer's driving home, so what does he do?<eos> I mean, he wants to be a nice guy, so he offers him work...<eos> So if... if Jack had some kind of relationship with the truck driver, that that would be very interesting.<eos> - I mean... you're the writer, right?
Jack!<eos> What's up?<eos> Did you hear that scream?<eos> - Scream? - Just now.<eos> - You didn't hear it?
- Scream? - Just now.<eos> - You didn't hear it?<eos> - No. It was a woman's scream.<eos> I heard it from inside.<eos> You didn't hear it?
- You didn't hear it?<eos> - No. It was a woman's scream.<eos> I heard it from inside.<eos> You didn't hear it?<eos> You mean that?
I heard it from inside.<eos> You didn't hear it?<eos> You mean that?<eos> Nah.<eos> You expecting somebody?
You expecting somebody?<eos> It's the grocery store.<eos> I got a standing order. They deliver every week.<eos> Paul, not too far.<eos> What are you doing?
- Hank's not working today?<eos> - No, not today.<eos> - Here's your delivery.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> By the way, Mr. Lopez, Pat mentioned you may have a check for him.
Yeah, he also said a postdated check would be fine.<eos> I don't have that for you today.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Well, I don't really wanna get in trouble my first day.<eos> You won't.
I'm sorry.<eos> Well, I don't really wanna get in trouble my first day.<eos> You won't.<eos> I know Pat a long time.<eos> It's... you're gonna be fine, all right?
Okay, bye.<eos> Paul.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> We had an agreement.<eos> - Now you're breaking it.
What's the sheriff doing here?<eos> No idea.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> You're both smart enough not to try anything, right?
Paul.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Deputy Carcano. How can I help you?<eos> You shouldn't leave your tools out in this weather, they'll get rusty.
You shouldn't leave your tools out in this weather, they'll get rusty.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'll get around to it.<eos> - You know, it's been busy.<eos> - Listen, we're looking for this woman. I was wondering if by any chance you've seen her?
Do you have a mailbox elsewhere on the property?<eos> Perhaps she left it there.<eos> No, no, no. Everything I get is dropped off here at the house, yeah. Right, right.<eos> Well, listen, thanks for your time.<eos> If you see something...
- You okay?<eos> - Yeah, I'm good, I'm good.<eos> - He's mine.<eos> I'll take care of it.<eos> I'll tell them you had guests.
All right.<eos> Preparing for orbital mode over signal position now.<eos> Mother, please coordinate launch sequence.<eos> Understood.<eos> You are clear to launch, Lander One.
Yeah.<eos> We're having some trouble reading you.<eos> Is there any way you can try and boost the signal?<eos> We may have clipped something on our way down in the water.<eos> If you can hear me, I'm gonna check for potential damage... on the hull first, and then I will check the uplink.
Chris.<eos> Hold up.<eos> I think I wanna stay here.<eos> This might be a good place to start a full ecology workup.<eos> You can pick me up on the way back.
A deadly virus.<eos> Payload accidentally deployed when we were landing.<eos> In the confusion, we lost control of the ship.<eos> Elizabeth died in the crash.<eos> You've seen the result of the pathogen.
All the animals, the meat, if you will.<eos> Either kill them outright or use them as incubators to spawn a hybrid form.<eos> Highly aggressive.<eos> Have we been infected?<eos> You'd know by now.
Captain Oram.<eos> Field transmitters aren't going to have a chance through all this stone.<eos> Is there a safe way to get to the roof?<eos> Assuredly.<eos> And please do make yourselves at home... as much as you're able in this dire necropolis.
Report, Expedition Team.<eos> Come in, please.<eos> Come in.<eos> Do you read me?<eos> Are you reading me, Landing Team?
How could you?<eos> It trusted me.<eos> David, I met the devil when I was a child... and I've never forgotten him.<eos> So, David, you're gonna tell me exactly what's going on... or I am going to seriously... fuck up your perfect composure.<eos> As you wish, Captain.
We tried to help her, but we didn't make it.<eos> Tee?<eos> Copy.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> As you can see, I've become a bit of an amateur zoologist over the years.
Idle hands are the devil's workshop, Captain.<eos> Come.<eos> This is what I wanted to show you.<eos> My successes.<eos> You see, Captain, my work has been frustrated... by the lack of an essential ingredient.
Richard Wagner.<eos> Das Rheingold, Act Two.<eos> The Entry of the Gods into Valhalla.<eos> Yes, David.<eos> As you wish.
- All right!<eos> Well, I know four Smurfs who have some explaining to do.<eos> - Oh, boy.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Oh, my gosh. Papa, you will not believe it.
Please. Please.<eos> - Smurfette sees this mystery Smurf.<eos> - We have to go to the Forbidden Forest.<eos> I've told you time and again, the Forbidden Forest is forbidden.<eos> And now you're talking about maps and mystery Smurfs and Gargamel's lair.
- Smurfette sees this mystery Smurf.<eos> - We have to go to the Forbidden Forest.<eos> I've told you time and again, the Forbidden Forest is forbidden.<eos> And now you're talking about maps and mystery Smurfs and Gargamel's lair.<eos> None of this makes any sense, and I really don't understand why you can't follow simple rules.

And now you're talking about maps and mystery Smurfs and Gargamel's lair.<eos> None of this makes any sense, and I really don't understand why you can't follow simple rules.<eos> You snuck out and it put you all in danger.<eos> Seems to me the only way I can keep you safe is if...<eos> You're grounded.
- Come on!<eos> No "buts."<eos> None of you are to take one step out of your mushrooms without telling me where you're going.<eos> Do you understand that?<eos> - You're right, Papa.
- You're right, Papa.<eos> - What?<eos> I don't know what we were thinking.<eos> Good.<eos> Because, as I was saying, you behaved completely irresponsibly. Yes.
This is not funny.<eos> Watch it!<eos> Let me go!<eos> These nests are made of some material I've never seen before.<eos> You know, I think I've had enough of these flying Antipastos for one day.
What are you doing here?<eos> Well, I was thinking of getting a little place out here.<eos> Just a quiet place in the forest.<eos> It's a little breezy up on the hill.<eos> What do you think I'm doing out here?
Clumsy?<eos> How you doing?<eos> Okay, I guess.<eos> Just hang tight, Clumsy.<eos> I'm not sure how long this will take or how long we'll be down here, so, everybody, whatever you do, don't eat all your rations.
Smurfette?<eos> Before you say anything, just listen.<eos> Now, I know yesterday I might have been a bit tough on you and the boys, and I know there are times I'm a little overprotective.<eos> Okay, a lot overprotective.<eos> But you have to understand, you snuck out.
Before you say anything, just listen.<eos> Now, I know yesterday I might have been a bit tough on you and the boys, and I know there are times I'm a little overprotective.<eos> Okay, a lot overprotective.<eos> But you have to understand, you snuck out.<eos> You have to be more careful.
- Sounds awesome!<eos> - Use this.<eos> - Grab on!<eos> I don't know about this.<eos> You won't regret it.
Wet, a little tired, kind of waterlogged.<eos> Thanks for asking, but...<eos> I'm still evil, so...<eos> Enjoy drowning.<eos> Hope you're better swimmers than you are judges of wizards' character.
And if he went there, then that means the Swamp of No Return.<eos> There's no way he could survive.<eos> Help me! Help me!<eos> There's no way I'll survive!<eos> With all due respect, you don't know Gargamel.
I think we'll be just fine here.<eos> Spitfire!<eos> Okay.<eos> So, what does this Gargamel look like?<eos> You know, he's your typical wizard.
He doesn't seem so tough.<eos> Yeah, Gargamel!<eos> That's what you get when you attack Smurfy Grove.<eos> - Gargamel?<eos> What are you talking about?
Where are the boys?<eos> - 'Sup, Papa?<eos> - Hello there.<eos> I rode a dragonfly!<eos> Well, thank goodness you're all okay.
- 'Sup, Papa?<eos> - Hello there.<eos> I rode a dragonfly!<eos> Well, thank goodness you're all okay.<eos> How did you find us?
Well, thank goodness you're all okay.<eos> How did you find us?<eos> I wasn't born yesterday, you know.<eos> Yeah, that's clear.<eos> Look, you four are coming home with me. Now.
Yeah, that's clear.<eos> Look, you four are coming home with me. Now.<eos> Not so fast, Papa-thing.<eos> "Papa-thing"?<eos> Are you the one in charge here?
Are you the one in charge here?<eos> That's right.<eos> I'm Smurfwillow, leader of the Smurfs.<eos> I'm afraid that's quite impossible, because I happen to be the leader of the Smurfs.<eos> Whatever you say, Papa-thing.
It's another jailbreak!<eos> - No, Gargamel.<eos> No.<eos> - Quiet down.<eos> You'll all get your turn.
Steven, it's me, Gloria!<eos> I'm your wife.<eos> These are our children.<eos> You're not my family!<eos> You killed them, just like the others.
It's them.<eos> Look at them!<eos> Look at them!<eos> It's just like the neighbors.<eos> Go to my shed. You'll see I'm right!
Let me help you.<eos> It's not my fault.<eos> I've given birth to the devil.<eos> It's the devil!<eos> You're tired.
I've given birth to the devil.<eos> It's the devil!<eos> You're tired.<eos> Give me the baby.<eos> You don't want to hurt her.
Maybe he'd change my luck.<eos> He'd definitely be less mopey than you.<eos> John Constantine, the man who perfected the bad idea.<eos> The only reason I came to this dung heap of a casino is to find a relic to keep that monster locked away forever.<eos> Boys, boys! You're boring me.
Once more with words of metered rhyme comes Etrigan the Slayer just in time.<eos> Easy now, brother.<eos> We're on the same side, right?<eos> Let's use our words.<eos> Are you having a laugh?
You know where I can find John Constantine?<eos> - No.<eos> - You must have some idea.<eos> We don't keep in touch.<eos> I know you two have history, so I...
Hey, I told you not to do that, Orchid.<eos> Use a bloody door.<eos> I am glad to see you are well.<eos> - How new is this one?<eos> - Not what you think.
- But not monkeys.<eos> - You're still way ahead on dead monkeys.<eos> - You just have to make things...<eos> - We're wasting time.<eos> He's dead, and I accept the risks, so can we get to it, or do you two need a timeout?
No.<eos> He's dying.<eos> John Constantine, purveyor of the dark arts and lifeline of last resort.<eos> No matter. Your friend's soul will be collected, and there's nothing you can do to alter that.<eos> Why don't you go do something useful, like haunt a house?
Well, doctors say an upbeat attitude can help, so what I'll focus on today is that I met Batman.<eos> Force of good.<eos> It was also nice seeing you, Zatanna.<eos> Now, if you'll excuse me...<eos> You can show yourselves out.
The situation was not how it seemed.<eos> The apartment was like that when I arrived. Richard as well.<eos> - Come on! You were all over him.<eos> - I was attempting to help.<eos> When you burst in, I knew I'd get blamed, so I ran.
I'm afraid that's not possible, friend Demon.<eos> I apologize to both you and Jason Blood, but your future portends a shared destiny.<eos> Caught now, imprisoned in the form of man. I fix the demon, Etrigan.<eos> It was also the beginning of my eternal life sentence with Etrigan.<eos> I didn't think you'd give it up willingly, and though this piece is useless without the other half, it's far from powerless.
I only know John Constantine because he enrages me.<eos> Faust lives in an observatory which is invisible.<eos> It's a place where dark magic would infect the earth below it.<eos> I will take you there so you are no longer here.<eos> The place you seek is there.
Yeah!<eos> That's the stuff.<eos> Why aren't we inside?<eos> Because Ritchie's bloody well taken control of the House.<eos> This is what you get for having mates.

"Go style."<eos> This tattoo looks like a ring to me.<eos> The details are many.<eos> I think the artist of all colors painted them.<eos> If the shop found a snag, You'll find the artist, You will find a bank thief.
It seems to me a simple matter.<eos> True, I thank you very much, old man. We'll get you a job in the police.<eos> Listen, I watch a television series.<eos> Called "Lo and Order" They solve crimes faster than you.<eos> You should see it.

Because it is difficult to get kidneys.

What is going on here exactly?<eos> What is going on here exactly?<eos> Both lost his mind.<eos> Think about it, "Al".<eos> I do not want to think about anything, I am not a bank robber. Neither are you, nor are you, "Willie."

She did not steal anything.<eos> Because your Nazi officer was chasing me.<eos> No, they were clinging to your friend.<eos> He was chasing me, When someone comes after me, I run away. Thus do things.<eos> Listen, you are old.
Listen, you are old.<eos> I will become like you after 40 or 50 years, I understand that.<eos> Take it.<eos> These are some coupons.<eos> We will double it on Tuesday, But I'm sure you already know that.
Take it.<eos> These are some coupons.<eos> We will double it on Tuesday, But I'm sure you already know that.<eos> So, do not steal, this is wrong.<eos> If you stole, do not steal from the Valley Town.
You made me a partner in the crime of theft.<eos> We did not ask you to do anything.<eos> I brought you here. I'll take you, so I'm the driver of the escape.<eos> Do not give yourself greater than its size. Leading like my grandmother, She was driving a horse and cart.<eos> This is a good joke, so you can go back Walk home.

Frankenstein is one of their favorite characters.<eos> I must have been there More than an hour.<eos> Yes, I've had stomach problems for years Due to over-drinking.<eos> It is called inflammation of the intestines, Says the doctor I have to remove part of my colon.

Makes it easy to remember the truth.<eos> Yes, almost perfect.<eos> But let me tell you something about criminals.<eos> They always make a silly mistake. Spoil their entire scheme.<eos> I want you to go with me On a trip Hey Harding.

Sergio, close the door!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Why are they shooting at us?<eos> Keep down.<eos> What are you doing?
Someone's been hired to kill you.<eos> That's insane.<eos> Does this have something to do with my father?<eos> Did he say anything?<eos> Where are you going?
I'll freak out.<eos> There are people out there that are still hunting you.<eos> They're gonna kill you.<eos> Okay, but just until the border?<eos> - You promise?
Okay, but just until the border?<eos> - You promise?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> But, um... I had an MRI once, and the nurse talked me through the whole thing, so do you mind doing that?
Nice dogs.<eos> I don't think I've seen these ones before.<eos> They're young, from a newer litter.<eos> Haus!<eos> You're not bringing me good news.
I don't think I've seen these ones before.<eos> They're young, from a newer litter.<eos> Haus!<eos> You're not bringing me good news.<eos> I appreciate that you want to send a message, but this is turning into a major-league clusterfuck.

You don't know what you're doing with this girl.<eos> But one way or another, this girl will die.<eos> You have to know that.<eos> Just say a prayer for her and be done.<eos> You left me in there?
I'm afraid I can't do that.<eos> Ella, this is Special Agent Gina Banks with the FBI.<eos> - I work with Interpol.<eos> - What?<eos> You need to tell me where you are.
Yes.<eos> Don't!<eos> No.<eos> Please.<eos> Please, you don't have to do this.
Don't!<eos> No.<eos> Please.<eos> Please, you don't have to do this.<eos> You don't have to.
That was good.<eos> While obviously we can't mention clients by name, our firm has handled sensitive issues for many high-profile individuals such as yourself.<eos> I like to think of myself as unique.<eos> Of course, and at Ashland, Phillips, Hornick you will be treated as such.<eos> As you probably know, my previous attorney died unexpectedly.
Martin Hatto.<eos> Mr. Hatto handled a number of sensitive issues involving my U.S. interests.<eos> At the time of his death, Martin was having his own legal difficulties with the IRS.<eos> This was very disappointing to me.<eos> And you believe he may have violated attorney-client privilege?
Ella, move!<eos> Now!<eos> Fuck!<eos> Are you okay?<eos> How do you do it?
Now!<eos> Fuck!<eos> Are you okay?<eos> How do you do it?<eos> How do you kill people?
How do you kill people?<eos> I mean, that's, like, your job, right?<eos> Someone gives you money and says, "Murder this person,"<eos> and then you just...<eos> you go and you do it?
Shoot<eos> Shoot<eos> That's how.<eos> Come on.<eos> You live here?
Who's the girl in the pictures?<eos> That's my daughter.<eos> Her name's Jillian.<eos> Your daughter?<eos> You're someone's dad?
You're someone's dad?<eos> Does she live here?<eos> I never met her.<eos> Her mother left me when she was pregnant.<eos> You don't even want to meet her?
You don't even want to meet her?<eos> I don't think it's best for her.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> I think every girl needs a father, even if he's a dick.<eos> What are you doing?
What are you doing?<eos> Just get out of here a minute.<eos> This was your plan?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Are you kidding me?
Are you kidding me?<eos> I trusted you.<eos> Go in the other room.<eos> It's a great plan.<eos> You're gonna fucking die.
I trusted you.<eos> Go in the other room.<eos> It's a great plan.<eos> You're gonna fucking die.<eos> I thought you were helping me, that that's what we came here to do.
You're gonna fucking die.<eos> I thought you were helping me, that that's what we came here to do.<eos> I thought you were helping me.<eos> Give me a minute.<eos> No, you were right.
My parents are both dead.<eos> I'm going to inherit money.<eos> - I can pay you.<eos> - Wha...?<eos> I want you to kill him.
I want you to kill him.<eos> Addison.<eos> He killed my father.<eos> Don't laugh at me.<eos> What? Are you afraid of him?
I have, um, Ella Hatto here in reception for Mr. Addison.<eos> The guests will be arriving at the front gate and directed to the valet.<eos> The caterers will be distributing...<eos> There's an Ella Hatto waiting for you in reception.<eos> ...and the music will be light jazz as you've requested.
Put the gun down!<eos> - Halt! Police!<eos> - Do not move!<eos> Stand still!<eos> You're telling me Richard Addison of Addison Industries murdered your family.

Stand still!<eos> You're telling me Richard Addison of Addison Industries murdered your family.<eos> You've got to tell me the truth.<eos> You've walked into Richard Addison's office with a loaded weapon.<eos> You are in so much trouble.
And then the account's frozen.<eos> Then, you'd better get her out of there and get my money, don't you think?<eos> Otherwise, why do I pay you?<eos> Okay, this way, please.<eos> You're very lucky, Miss Hatto.
Otherwise, why do I pay you?<eos> Okay, this way, please.<eos> You're very lucky, Miss Hatto.<eos> Mr. Addison isn't going to press charges.<eos> You mean I'm free to go?
It's just... it's just business.<eos> Sorry.<eos> It's just you don't want to do this.<eos> We'll be at the airport pretty soon.<eos> Ella, I know you've been through a lot, but we don't have much time.
We'll be at the airport pretty soon.<eos> Ella, I know you've been through a lot, but we don't have much time.<eos> I have to ask you some questions, okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Now, I understand you have a bank account in Switzerland.
Do you know how much is in it?<eos> A few hundred dollars.<eos> My dad puts money in every month.<eos> Ella, I know this is difficult, but we think that account may have something to do with your father's murder, so I have to ask these questions.<eos> Do you ever go online and check your balance?

I'm going to deal with this myself.<eos> Open the gate.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I think it was probably some fireworks.<eos> Don't you think?
You little bitch. Huh?<eos> Same gun I used to kill your father.<eos> Too many fuck-ups, the both of you.<eos> Such a shame.<eos> You were two of my better employees.
They think I'm like one of those Cunts in the Bible that live forever?<eos> Is that what they think?<eos> - I'm not sure.<eos> They make an assessment.<eos> - I've written letters, you know.
Never got back to us, like.<eos> Too fucking busy to speak to the working classes.<eos> Different story when she needs a soldier.<eos> "Step this way, Mr. Begbie." "Sign here, Mr. Begbie."<eos> I didn't know you'd served in the army.
- Didn't fucking mention it.<eos> I cannot believe it.<eos> What was the last fucking thing I told you?<eos> Mind and mention the diminished responsibility, you fucking dumb Cunt!<eos> I think it would be better if we brought this meeting to a close, and you and I get together once you've had time to reflect upon the situation.
I was still wearing a jumper.<eos> "Happens every year, Mr. Murphy."<eos> How was I supposed to know?<eos> I've been on skag for 15 years.<eos> You know how it is...

No, you cannot fucking do that.<eos> See, if you were my son, you'd have stabbed us there.<eos> I'd be lying, breathing my last through a hole in my chest.<eos> But you cannot fucking do that.<eos> What do you want?
Get in.<eos> It's Mark and Simon, right?<eos> Do you know who I am?<eos> Good.<eos> So you know that I own a couple of saunas in the north of Edinburgh.
We got the money.<eos> - What?<eos> - How much?<eos> The money.<eos> What do you call it?
Used to be steam engines to all over from here.<eos> Choo-fucking-choo!<eos> "An old drunkard, whom Begbie had been looking at,<eos> "lurched up to us, wine bottle in his hand."<eos> What're you up to, lads, eh?
June.<eos> Franco Junior.<eos> Can I come in for a moment?<eos> There's something I have to do tonight, and then I'm going away.<eos> One way or another, it'll be a long time before you see me again.
Good morning, Belle!<eos> Wonderful book you have there.<eos> Have you read it?<eos> Well, not that one.<eos> But, you know, books...
Extraordinary.<eos> A man of taste.<eos> He was talking about me.<eos> Oops!<eos> Well, wherever you are... I'm just going to warm myself by the fire.
Go!<eos> All right, Papa.<eos> I'll leave.<eos> I need a minute alone with him.<eos> Are you so cold-hearted... you won't allow a daughter to kiss her father goodbye?
I'm not afraid.<eos> And I will escape.<eos> I promise.<eos> What?<eos> You took his place.
What?<eos> You took his place.<eos> He's my father.<eos> He's a fool.<eos> And so are you.
He gets so dramatic.<eos> Hello.<eos> Oh, you are very strong.<eos> This is a great quality.<eos> What are you?
Oh, you are very strong.<eos> This is a great quality.<eos> What are you?<eos> I am Lumiere!<eos> And you can talk?
I am Lumiere!<eos> And you can talk?<eos> Well, of course he can talk.<eos> It's all he ever does.<eos> Now, Lumiere, as head of the household... I demand that you put her back in her cell at once.
A man, or a mantle clock?<eos> Ready, miss?<eos> - Trust me.<eos> You must forgive first impressions.<eos> I hope you are not too startled.
I'm talking to a candle.<eos> Candelabra, please.<eos> Enormous difference.<eos> But consider me at your service.<eos> The castle is your home now... so feel free to go anywhere you like.
Welcome to your new home.<eos> It's modest, but comfortable.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> But of course!<eos> Master wanted you to have the finest room in the castle.
I've been told I'm clingy, but I really don't get it.<eos> Please, please.<eos> Someone, someone.<eos> - You, help...<eos> You must help me.
Who's got her?<eos> A beast!<eos> A huge, horrid, monstrous beast!<eos> My daughter's life is in danger.<eos> Why do you laugh?
- Heads up, Mrs. Potts. - Oh.<eos> Lumiere!<eos> - Oh! - Be calm.<eos> Let me do the talking.<eos> You're making her dinner!
Lumiere!<eos> - Oh! - Be calm.<eos> Let me do the talking.<eos> You're making her dinner!<eos> Well, we thought you might appreciate the company.
You're making her dinner!<eos> Well, we thought you might appreciate the company.<eos> Master, I just want to assure you... that I had no part in this hopeless plan.<eos> Preparing a dinner, designing a gown for her, giving her... a suite in the east wing!<eos> You gave her a bedroom?
With every passing day... we become less human.<eos> She's the daughter of a common thief.<eos> What kind of person do you think that makes her?<eos> Oh, you can't judge people... by who their father is, now can you?<eos> You'll join me for dinner.
The girl lost her father... and her freedom in one day.<eos> Yes, the poor thing is probably in there, scared to death.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Just a minute.<eos> You see?
Come, come. Show me the smile.<eos> - Oh, mon dieu!<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> Will you join me for dinner?<eos> You've taken me as your prisoner and now you want to have dinner with me?
Well, be my guest.<eos> Go ahead and starve.<eos> If she doesn't eat with me... then she doesn't eat at all.<eos> Idiots!<eos> You can't talk to us like that. I forbid it.
Idiots!<eos> You can't talk to us like that. I forbid it.<eos> Am I too late?<eos> Shame, I was really going to tell him off this time.<eos> Oh, Master, you've returned.
You just leave it to me.<eos> I told you to go away.<eos> Don't worry, dear.<eos> It's only Mrs. Potts.<eos> Oh, aren't you a vision!
I'm worried about him.<eos> He's never been on his own.<eos> Cheer up, my poppet.<eos> Things will turn out in the end.<eos> You'll feel a lot better... after dinner.
You'll feel a lot better... after dinner.<eos> But he said, "If she doesn't eat with me, then she doesn't eat at all."<eos> Mmm, people say a lot of things in anger.<eos> It is our choice whether or not to listen.<eos> You coming, poppet?
Go!<eos> They are coming.<eos> Final checks, everyone! Tout de suite!<eos> No, you don't!<eos> If the master finds out you violated his orders and fed her he will blame me!
Sotto voce!<eos> Of course!<eos> Are there any other tasteless demands... you wish to make upon my artistry?<eos> No, that's it.<eos> There you are, dear.
They can sing, they can dance<eos> After all, miss, this is France<eos> And a dinner here is never second best<eos> Go on unfold your menu<eos> Take a glance and then you'll Be our guest, oui, our guest
Beef ragout<eos> Cheese soufflé<eos> Pie and pudding en flambé<eos> We'll prepare and serve with flair A culinary cabaret<eos> You're alone and you're scared
Too long we've been rusting<eos> Needing so much more than dusting<eos> Needing exercise, a chance to use our skills<eos> Most days we just lay around the castle<eos> Flabby, fat and lazy You walked in and whoops-a-daisy
While the candlelight's still glowing<eos> Let us help you, we'll keep going<eos> Course by<eos> Course! One by one<eos> 'Til you shout, "Enough, I'm done!"
Be our guest<eos> Be our guest<eos> Please be our guest<eos> Pudding?<eos> I don't understand why you're all being so kind to me.
Be our guest<eos> Please be our guest<eos> Pudding?<eos> I don't understand why you're all being so kind to me.<eos> Surely, you're as trapped here as I am.
Straight to bed.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> What did you do to it?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Do you realize what you could have done? You could have damned us all!
Go!<eos> Checkmate.<eos> Again.<eos> Wait! No!<eos> You cheated again.
No!<eos> Please don't go!<eos> It's dangerous!<eos> Oh, my!<eos> You have to help me.
Please don't go!<eos> It's dangerous!<eos> Oh, my!<eos> You have to help me.<eos> You have to stand.
Deep breaths.<eos> So, why don't we just turn around?<eos> Go back to Villeneuve.<eos> I'm sure Belle is at home, cooking up a lovely dinner.<eos> If you think I've made all this up... then why did you offer to help?
Because I want to marry your daughter!<eos> Now, let's go home.<eos> Belle is not at home.<eos> She is with the...<eos> You say beast one more time... I will feed you to the wolves!
Please, forgive me, old bean.<eos> That's no way to talk to my future father-in-law... now is it?<eos> Future father-in-law?<eos> Yeah!<eos> You will never marry my daughter.
For the sake of exhausting all of our options... do we maybe wanna consider a slightly less... gruesome alternative?<eos> Are you coming?<eos> Yah!<eos> That hurts!<eos> If you held still, it wouldn't hurt as much.
Are you coming?<eos> Yah!<eos> That hurts!<eos> If you held still, it wouldn't hurt as much.<eos> Well, if you hadn't run away, none of this would have happened.
That hurts!<eos> If you held still, it wouldn't hurt as much.<eos> Well, if you hadn't run away, none of this would have happened.<eos> Well, if you hadn't frightened me, I wouldn't have run away.<eos> Well, you shouldn't have been in the west wing.
Why do you care about him so much?<eos> We've looked after him all his life.<eos> But he's cursed you somehow.<eos> Why?<eos> You did nothing!
We've looked after him all his life.<eos> But he's cursed you somehow.<eos> Why?<eos> You did nothing!<eos> You're quite right there, dear.
We become rubbish.<eos> I want to help you.<eos> There must be some way to break the curse.<eos> Well, there is one.<eos> It's not for you to worry about, lamb.
Thank you, Agathe.<eos> "Love can transpose to form and dignity.<eos> "Love looks not with the eyes "but with the mind and therefore..."<eos> "And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind."<eos> You know Shakespeare?
I'm sorry?<eos> Well, all that heartache and pining and...<eos> So many better things to read.<eos> Like what?<eos> Well, there are a couple of... things in here you could start with.
Well, there are a couple of... things in here you could start with.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> It's wonderful!<eos> Yes. I suppose it is.<eos> Well, if you like it so much, then it's yours.
How amazing!<eos> It was her cruelest trick of all.<eos> It was just another curse.<eos> The outside world has no place for a creature like me... but it can for you.<eos> Think of the one place you've always wanted to see.
It was the one story Papa could never bring himself to tell.<eos> I knew better than to ask.<eos> A doctor's mask.<eos> Plague.<eos> You must leave now.
Gaston... did you try to kill Maurice?<eos> Maurice!<eos> Thank heavens!<eos> I've spent the last five days... - trying to find you.<eos> - You tried to kill me.
Maurice!<eos> Thank heavens!<eos> I've spent the last five days... - trying to find you.<eos> - You tried to kill me.<eos> You left me to the wolves.
- You tried to kill me.<eos> You left me to the wolves.<eos> Wolves?<eos> It's one thing to rave about your delusions. It's another to accuse me of attempted murder.<eos> Maurice... do you have any proof of what you're saying?
Maurice... do you have any proof of what you're saying?<eos> Ask Agathe.<eos> She rescued me.<eos> Agathe!<eos> You'd hang your accusations on the testimony... of a filthy hag?
Monsieur LeFou.<eos> He was there.<eos> He saw it all.<eos> Me?<eos> You're right.
Well, it's a complicated question on a number of accounts...<eos> But no.<eos> No, he did not.<eos> You...<eos> Maurice... it pains me to say this, but you've become a danger to yourself and others.
No, he did not.<eos> You...<eos> Maurice... it pains me to say this, but you've become a danger to yourself and others.<eos> No wonder Belle ran away.<eos> You need help, sir.
You need help, sir.<eos> A place to heal your troubled mind.<eos> Everything's going to be fine.<eos> Just fine.<eos> Well, I saw her in the ballroom... and said, "You're making everything look so beautiful.
"We should have a dance tonight." I never imagined she'd actually say yes.<eos> What was I thinking?<eos> No, Master.<eos> It's perfect.<eos> The rose has only four petals left which means tonight... you can tell her how you feel.
Do not be discouraged.<eos> She is the one.<eos> I wish you'd stop saying that!<eos> There is no "one."<eos> You care for her, don't you?
You care for her, don't you?<eos> Well, then, woo her with beautiful music and romantic candlelight.<eos> Yes, and when the moment's just right...<eos> Well, how will I know?<eos> You will feel slightly nauseous.
Well, how will I know?<eos> You will feel slightly nauseous.<eos> Don't worry, Master.<eos> You'll do fine.<eos> Just stop being so nervous and tell Belle how you feel.
You will feel slightly nauseous.<eos> Don't worry, Master.<eos> You'll do fine.<eos> Just stop being so nervous and tell Belle how you feel.<eos> Because if you don't... I promise you'll be drinking cold tea for the rest of your days!
I'd almost forgotten the feeling.<eos> It's foolish, I suppose... for a creature like me to hope... that one day he might earn your affection.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Really?<eos> You think you could be happy here?
What are they doing to him?<eos> He's in trouble!<eos> Then you must go to him.<eos> What did you say?<eos> You must go to him.
What did you say?<eos> You must go to him.<eos> No time to waste.<eos> No... you keep it with you.<eos> Then you'll always have a way to look back on me.
This man is weak.<eos> Please!<eos> He needs a hospital... not an asylum!<eos> Have you ever seen the inside of a mad house, Maurice?<eos> You wouldn't last a week.
It's true, Belle.<eos> He's been raving about a beast... in a castle!<eos> I've just come from the castle and there is a beast!<eos> You'd say anything to set him free. Your word is hardly proof.<eos> You want proof?
Lock her up too.<eos> - No!<eos> - Come here!<eos> Shut up!<eos> You won't get away with this, Gaston!
Where are we?<eos> This place seems familiar.<eos> Like I've been here before.<eos> Oh, hello, there.<eos> You must be the talking tea cup.
This place seems familiar.<eos> Like I've been here before.<eos> Oh, hello, there.<eos> You must be the talking tea cup.<eos> And you must be... his grandmother.
I'm coming for you, beast.<eos> - No!<eos> - Belle?<eos> Belle!<eos> You came back!
Don't!<eos> It's too far!<eos> Please!<eos> Come on.<eos> You came back.
- Oh... - Plumette?<eos> Plumette?<eos> Oh, my darling, Plumette.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Maestro, you were so brave.
Lumiere, look!<eos> Oh, my Prince!<eos> Hello, old friend.<eos> Oh! It's so good to see you.<eos> You saved our lives, mademoiselle.
That's my wife, Vicki.<eos> Those two yours?<eos> They are.<eos> Seem to be getting on. Yeah, well, i suppose we should, too, or this whole thing's gonna get awkward.<eos> Hey, listen, we're just camped right up here if you wanna come by later, help us light some marshmallows on fire.
Hey, listen, we're just camped right up here if you wanna come by later, help us light some marshmallows on fire.<eos> That sounds good.<eos> Great!<eos> I'll see you later.<eos> You have a nice family.
Good night.<eos> She asks good questions, doesn't she?<eos> Yeah, she sure does.<eos> She's a special girl.<eos> You both are.
Missy!<eos> God. Missy!<eos> God.<eos> Please, god.<eos> We need to know if there's anything different from the way you remember it.
I gotta get changed and go run some errands in town.<eos> Mack.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Don't forget we love each other.<eos> And you don't know anything about it?
And you don't know anything about it?<eos> Well, there's no stamp.<eos> No.<eos> Well, if it's not stamped, it's not delivered.<eos> Well, you want your mail while you're here?
How about some introductions?<eos> I'm Elousia.<eos> I have a lot of names, but that's one of my favorites.<eos> Or, if you want, you can call me what nan does.<eos> You know nan?
Or, if you want, you can call me what nan does.<eos> You know nan?<eos> Yes.<eos> Very well.<eos> Are you saying that you're...
Dreaming or otherwise.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Let me ask you somethin'.<eos> I've been tellin' you all about Josh and Kate and nan.<eos> But if you're real, then you already know everything I'm gonna say before I even say it, right?
Wanna take a look?<eos> Okay.<eos> Watch this one.<eos> Incredible.<eos> I get that you're all connected.
That's probably because I'm human.<eos> But you're god, too, right?<eos> I'm the best way any human can relate to papa and sarayu.<eos> To see me is to see them.<eos> You're all so different.
My daughter is dead.<eos> And there's nothing you can say that will ever justify what happened to her.<eos> Looking for the way out?<eos> If you are looking for your truck, it's up that way. Just beyond the trees.<eos> You might need these though.
If you are looking for your truck, it's up that way. Just beyond the trees.<eos> You might need these though.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Just to be clear, we're not justifying anything.<eos> We'd like to heal it, if you'd let us.
Thanks.<eos> Just to be clear, we're not justifying anything.<eos> We'd like to heal it, if you'd let us.<eos> Before you go, there's something in the garden<eos> I was hoping you could help me with. Before tomorrow's celebration.
"Keep going."<eos> Hello?<eos> Anyone?<eos> Sorry, I...<eos> You are?
I believe you.<eos> Overthenextfew weeks, mack improved rapidly.<eos> I'msure there are some who'll wonder ifeverythingreallyhappened the way mack recalls.<eos> Orifanyofit happenedatall.<eos> You'll have to decide for yourself, I suppose.
Hehasbecome achildagain.<eos> All right!<eos> Whoo! Or maybe the child he was never allowed to be, abiding in simple trust and wonder.<eos> Anditwouldn't surprise me if, every now and then, macktakesoffhis shoes. Just to see if...<eos> Well, you know.
Yeah, I'm a writer.<eos> Cards.<eos> Greetings.<eos> Uh... romantic ones.<eos> So, yeah, I'm a poet, if you've got to label me.
I was just about to ask for a meeting.<eos> Good luck, pal.<eos> Well, who's to say it's not good news?<eos> We'll keep our fingers crossed.<eos> Styvesan, I'm so glad you made the time.
Class it up.<eos> Quarters.<eos> That's your idea. Good.<eos> You want to put quarters in a romance card.<eos> Ray... I'm gonna have to let you go.
I've got twenty bucks in my pocket, to the last bum standing.<eos> All right, gentlemen: Fight!<eos> Go, Shitfoot.<eos> Mr. Ray!<eos> Hey, Mr. Ray, I know you're in there!
I can't ply my trade.<eos> And you can't write with the other fingers?<eos> You're gonna have to figure out a way to pay me.<eos> So?<eos> You want me to blow you?
Hey, watch what you're saying.<eos> There's children present.<eos> I have to watch him for my damn sister while she goes to school to learn how to clean teeth, and it's against the law for me to take him to the track.<eos> And I can't push him off the roof.<eos> You're in a real pickle.
I want you to meet Uncle Ray.<eos> Why is that woman crying?<eos> Who can say?<eos> Probably a love thing.<eos> Do you love anybody?
Maybe.<eos> Yeah, sure. Please.<eos> I need you to write a card.<eos> A romance card, a great one.<eos> Like the ones you used to write.
After hours.<eos> Make sure you use the back door, the one with the broken lock.<eos> - Ray. - Yeah. - This is hush-hush.<eos> So put the fuckin' money away.<eos> You know, if you had it, then you can get it back.
- I like your tat.<eos> - Oh. I saw it on the back of a truck once.<eos> I thought it was cuckoo.<eos> It is... cuckoo.<eos> You're not, though, are you?
I thought it was cuckoo.<eos> It is... cuckoo.<eos> You're not, though, are you?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> You're not cuckoo, are you?
You're not cuckoo, are you?<eos> I...<eos> - I'm... I'm Ray.<eos> - I'm Jill.<eos> You're not Ray Wentworth, are you? The card guy?
Thanks for sharing.<eos> That is so sad, don't you think?<eos> It's brutal.<eos> That's a person who's asking for so little.<eos> You still got that awesome tattoo?
Yeah. Seeing how awful these are is a real pick-me-up.<eos> Ah, yeah, it's pretty gross.<eos> I actually work here.<eos> Really?<eos> You don't walk around all the time in a red smock with a name tag?
Shitfoot?<eos> Ray?<eos> You okay?<eos> Hey, um, do you think that...<eos> Do you think that, um... we could, uh...
I'm Detective fucking Miller, fucking Homicide, that's who I am.<eos> Can I see a badge?<eos> Have a gander.<eos> It's pretty, isn't it?<eos> What kind of cards you write, Wentworth?
What kind of cards you write, Wentworth?<eos> Romance.<eos> Romance.<eos> So every time I forget to give one of your mushy-ass cards to my girl, I get cut off for a month.<eos> Perhaps if you were well-endowed, you wouldn't need one of my cards.
Romance.<eos> Romance.<eos> So every time I forget to give one of your mushy-ass cards to my girl, I get cut off for a month.<eos> Perhaps if you were well-endowed, you wouldn't need one of my cards.<eos> You punched me in the throat!
He was killed.<eos> To death.<eos> What happened to him?<eos> Shouldn't I be asking you that?<eos> - You think that I...?
For now.<eos> But you've got to deliver.<eos> Deliver what?<eos> Oh, I'll tell you what.<eos> You get out your feather pen, and you write a nice little card that'll open my girlfriend's legs again.
Shoot.<eos> All right.<eos> Oh... uh, I got an idea.<eos> How about a yard sale, then?<eos> You can put price tags on everything here.
And what about you?<eos> Well, see, I still... I get to live here while it goes on.<eos> It's kind of like a living showroom.<eos> Never been done.<eos> You're crazy.
Get you a job teaching Driver's Ed. Speed things up.<eos> And we have come to the moment in our service where we can go no farther, and stand on the edge of a chasm, yearning to hear...<eos> Sad day.<eos> Oh, yeah. Sad.<eos> You got the card?
- Clomping around. - Listen, can I use your back door?<eos> Seriously?<eos> Yeah, of your house.<eos> Can I use it?<eos> What are you doing with the lady, huh?
Seriously?<eos> Yeah, of your house.<eos> Can I use it?<eos> What are you doing with the lady, huh?<eos> You getting bi-curious, huh?
It was planned as a hate crime.<eos> I couldn't get that fucking cross into the ground.<eos> It's a lot tougher than it looks.<eos> Besides... hating a whole race of folks, now that's an awful lot of work.<eos> So you don't hate anyone now?
Napoleon gave it to his mother after she had a tumor removed from her ankle.<eos> It's French, and it translates into, "Feel better."<eos> She died two days after receiving it.<eos> Sit down, Mr. Wentworth, let's talk.<eos> You own AAAAA Greetings.
Sit down, Mr. Wentworth, let's talk.<eos> You own AAAAA Greetings.<eos> Mmm. And Paper Hearts.<eos> No, no, no. No, that belongs to my brother, Dilly.<eos> Well, Mr. Wentworth, they tell me that you were Card Writer of the Year in 2005, '06 and '07.
Mmm. And Paper Hearts.<eos> No, no, no. No, that belongs to my brother, Dilly.<eos> Well, Mr. Wentworth, they tell me that you were Card Writer of the Year in 2005, '06 and '07.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Also that you're divorced, you live alone, and you like to watch Bumfights.
Did you have him killed?<eos> That is a hefty accusation, Mr. Wentworth.<eos> Perhaps you should take that up with the police.<eos> Hello, darling!<eos> The word is, you have a sweetheart, Mr. Wentworth.
That is a hefty accusation, Mr. Wentworth.<eos> Perhaps you should take that up with the police.<eos> Hello, darling!<eos> The word is, you have a sweetheart, Mr. Wentworth.<eos> How do you know?
I thought Styvesan worked for you.<eos> Among many others.<eos> But this girlfriend of yours, congratulations.<eos> That's good, that's very good.<eos> I mean, after all, you need to feel the feelings before you can write about them.
Well, my father used to say, "Fair is where you end up."<eos> Write the card, Raymond.<eos> Why me?<eos> I have a sixth sense about these things, Mr. Wentworth.<eos> You've been a fool for love before.
Write the card, Raymond.<eos> Why me?<eos> I have a sixth sense about these things, Mr. Wentworth.<eos> You've been a fool for love before.<eos> You've got the gene for it.
You've been a fool for love before.<eos> You've got the gene for it.<eos> No. I'm a cynic.<eos> No, I'm a cynic.<eos> You're cynical.
- Nice place.<eos> - Nice sarcasm.<eos> - They're fake.<eos> - Yeah. I mean, they're made out of real... plastic.<eos> But, uh, if you have a magic act, they can...
Look at the clouds. There's some fascinating shapes today.<eos> There. The children are gone.<eos> Now, let's us adults have some straight talk.<eos> Where's the card, Mr. Wentworth?<eos> You killed Taft.
Now, let's us adults have some straight talk.<eos> Where's the card, Mr. Wentworth?<eos> You killed Taft.<eos> Taft was writing a card for my competition.<eos> You mean your brother.
The blind luck of the firstborn.<eos> But not me, Mr. Wentworth.<eos> I had to fight and claw my way for everything.<eos> Now, where's the card?<eos> No. You get nothing.
The universe cries out for sacrifice, and I'm simply following the template.<eos> Ray.<eos> He's serious.<eos> That little girl, she's...<eos> You needed a muse.
You needed a muse.<eos> Now... when my junky nephew and Jill bore a child, I simply wanted to have the little bean brought up properly.<eos> Of course, I was foolish enough to let her stay in the child's life.<eos> It was a tangled web indeed, but now I intend to clear the situation up, once and for all.<eos> You can have it.
No.<eos> We did not ask for that.<eos> I know.<eos> They are on his side.<eos> - Do you know him?
Tonight, I pay for the drinks.<eos> - All right.<eos> - Totally.<eos> Why not?<eos> If you say it.
How are you?<eos> Come on!<eos> Do it!<eos> Just!<eos> Yes. You know what?
Shit.<eos> It's a nightmare, damn it!<eos> I can enter?<eos> Two three four five six seven...<eos> You want it all in chips?
It's too much for me.<eos> The bet is $ 1,500.<eos> Wait.<eos> I have not seen it yet.<eos> Do you see it or do you retire?
Then we'll think about all that.<eos> You're right.<eos> - Sorry for the wait.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Would you like some coffee?
We'll fix it.<eos> We'll do whatever it takes. We'll get you up.<eos> - Agree?<eos> - Yes thanks.<eos> How many did you throw?
They are Freddy, Tony and Alex.<eos> He is nervous.<eos> Because he never saw the light of the day.<eos> Or yes, but usually before bed.<eos> Hey, he's my brother, but that does not mean that you can not be hard on him.
He will make fun of how I parked.<eos> Then he will make fun of my clothes.<eos> The joke will not be funny.<eos> Then he will look at you, he will have a revelation and say,<eos> "you look adorable".
Welcome.<eos> Did you buy it at ugly cost?<eos> Great.<eos> Fantastic. Yes.<eos> You look spectacular.
- Here. - Very good.<eos> Hi.<eos> Has a collect call from the convict's cook county prison...<eos> Michael.<eos> If you want to accept the charges, check one.

Eddie Garrett.<eos> - Who is he?<eos> - My collector.<eos> - What is a collector?<eos> - You do not know?
- Hello.<eos> - How are you?<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> Equally.<eos> I heard you speak very well. Yes.
Fuck.<eos> Hey.<eos> Uh, guys?<eos> Those are chrome-plated lugs.<eos> You're gonna strip them.
Shit.<eos> Come on, man.<eos> Uh, guys, guys.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Guys, seriously, you don't wanna do this.
I knew it was you.<eos> - Oh, fuck.<eos> - Please!<eos> I'm in trouble!<eos> You're the only one that could help!
As I live and breathe, the Wolverine.<eos> And he's a junkie now.<eos> Who the fuck are you?<eos> You know, you got some buckshot in your door.<eos> I heard you was in Phoenix.
Has her sights on you now.<eos> Doesn't ring any bells?<eos> I don't know any Gabriela, so get the fuck out of my car.<eos> Oh.<eos> You know...
Doesn't ring any bells?<eos> I don't know any Gabriela, so get the fuck out of my car.<eos> Oh.<eos> You know...<eos> I know what you're hiding, amigo.
No, Mr. Esperanza, no.<eos> I know I said June, but I need the boat now.<eos> Why would that mean the price go up?<eos> Listen to me.<eos> I know you wanted 70...
Eating his curds and whey<eos> Then came a big spider Which sat down beside her<eos> And frightened Miss Muffet...<eos> Friends, I have good news for you today!<eos> It's not about what you do.
Get it with steak!<eos> And with the cheese baked right in the shell... it's the next big thing!<eos> Go now while supplies last.<eos> Who are you?<eos> You know who I am.
And with the cheese baked right in the shell... it's the next big thing!<eos> Go now while supplies last.<eos> Who are you?<eos> You know who I am.<eos> You're the man who puts me to sleep.
Charles.<eos> Come on, now.<eos> How long have I been here?<eos> What are these?<eos> You remember what they are.
What are these?<eos> You remember what they are.<eos> The shots mellow the seizures.<eos> The pills keep them from happening.<eos> How about you blow on them to make them safe?
The shots mellow the seizures.<eos> The pills keep them from happening.<eos> How about you blow on them to make them safe?<eos> Fuck off, Logan.<eos> So you remember who I am now.
There are forces trying to kill them.<eos> - Forces?<eos> - They want help.<eos> Forces, forces.<eos> It's too bad you're not in that business anymore.
Charles, a long time.<eos> There are no new mutants.<eos> Understand?<eos> Hasn't been a new one born in 25 years. Not anywhere.<eos> You always thought... we were part of God's plan.
I can smell it.<eos> Best night ever!<eos> Hey, driver.<eos> I love you. I love you.<eos> You're such a doll.
Go north, cross to Canada.<eos> Anyone can do that job.<eos> I'll give you $50,000.<eos> How did you find me, huh?<eos> 'Cause you are fucking up my life, lady!
They're gonna have to pay for damages.<eos> And she has cash.<eos> I've seen it.<eos> You should get your fat ass back in your office.<eos> You'll get your money.
Please, wait! Look.<eos> Look. Here, take this.<eos> It's $20,000.<eos> Here. Take us to this address.<eos> You can have $30,000 more when we get there.
He wants to kill me and take her.<eos> And that's your daughter?<eos> Yes.<eos> I know you're still good inside.<eos> I know you want to help us.
And that's your daughter?<eos> Yes.<eos> I know you're still good inside.<eos> I know you want to help us.<eos> You don't know anything about me.
I need the girl.<eos> What girl?<eos> The one that goes along with that ball you're holding.<eos> There's no girl here.<eos> I know you went to the motel.
There was no girl. It was just the woman.<eos> Just the woman.<eos> Such as she was.<eos> So, you saw Gabriela.<eos> But you didn't call me.
Such as she was.<eos> So, you saw Gabriela.<eos> But you didn't call me.<eos> That hurts.<eos> You didn't shoot the poor thing, did you?
So, you saw Gabriela.<eos> But you didn't call me.<eos> That hurts.<eos> You didn't shoot the poor thing, did you?<eos> - No, did you?
- Of course.<eos> I wish you'd called me, Logan.<eos> Like I asked.<eos> See?<eos> You're not the only one that's been enhanced.
Laura!<eos> Honey, you wanna stay where you are.<eos> You wanna see your friends, right?<eos> Command, stop.<eos> You said alive or dead.
You know who she is, Logan.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> Does she remind you of anybody?<eos> I read about you when I was a kid.<eos> I believe you're thinking of someone else.
Does she remind you of anybody?<eos> I read about you when I was a kid.<eos> I believe you're thinking of someone else.<eos> Hmm.<eos> Now, if I'm not mistaken, you used to work for my team.
I read about you when I was a kid.<eos> I believe you're thinking of someone else.<eos> Hmm.<eos> Now, if I'm not mistaken, you used to work for my team.<eos> You were helping round up all those old mutes.
Hmm.<eos> Now, if I'm not mistaken, you used to work for my team.<eos> You were helping round up all those old mutes.<eos> What changed?<eos> You got religion?
Now, if I'm not mistaken, you used to work for my team.<eos> You were helping round up all those old mutes.<eos> What changed?<eos> You got religion?<eos> I'm gonna need you to do one more thing for the good guys... and track one more special mute for me.
What changed?<eos> You got religion?<eos> I'm gonna need you to do one more thing for the good guys... and track one more special mute for me.<eos> I'm not helping you.<eos> Of course, you'd say that.
She's a business mistake, a RD gone bad.<eos> There's liability.<eos> They can't have things with patents running around, hurting people, can they?<eos> We need to get her off the board before she hurts anybody else.<eos> Someone you care about, maybe.
Last ride.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Stop it.<eos> For God's sake, I can do this myself!<eos> Yeah, well, you're not doing it.
We are going to save as many children as we can.<eos> I read about a place, up north.<eos> A place for mutants.<eos> They call it Eden.<eos> If you are watching this, it means that I am dead.
There is no more money.<eos> That was a lie.<eos> She's not my child.<eos> But I love her.<eos> You may not love her.
How long has it been since you took your meds?<eos> Tell me, how long has it been?<eos> I don't know!<eos> Two days.<eos> You saw what happened yesterday.
Two days.<eos> You saw what happened yesterday.<eos> If that shit had gone on any longer, everyone in that casino...<eos> I did what I had to do to save Laura.<eos> You didn't do anything.
You saw what happened yesterday.<eos> If that shit had gone on any longer, everyone in that casino...<eos> I did what I had to do to save Laura.<eos> You didn't do anything.<eos> You just freaked out and had a fucking seizure!
And you're screaming at a machine.<eos> Oh, what?<eos> She can gut a man with her feet, she can't hear a few naughty words, huh?<eos> She can learn to be better.<eos> You mean, better than me?
We don't live far from here.<eos> - Uh, no, thanks.<eos> - That would be lovely!<eos> My name is Dr. Rice.<eos> But you can call me Zander if you like.
- Uh, no, thanks.<eos> - That would be lovely!<eos> My name is Dr. Rice.<eos> But you can call me Zander if you like.<eos> My colleague tells me you've been somewhat resistant.
- That would be lovely!<eos> My name is Dr. Rice.<eos> But you can call me Zander if you like.<eos> My colleague tells me you've been somewhat resistant.<eos> He believes you've been dispensing delayed information... to allow your friends to stay one step ahead.
And live off what?<eos> The Lord will provide.<eos> I'm still waiting for the Lord to provide me with a new thresher.<eos> All the same, I'd love to travel someday.<eos> And I bet you will.
I wish I could say you were a good pupil, but the words would choke me.<eos> Ma'am, I can't thank you enough for this.<eos> Uh, it was great.<eos> But we have a long drive ahead of us, so...<eos> But you need to rest, don't you?
But we have a long drive ahead of us, so...<eos> But you need to rest, don't you?<eos> Yeah, we'll find a motel somewhere.<eos> The nearest one is two hours from here and it's not even that nice.<eos> We have a perfectly fine room upstairs for your father and your daughter and you can sleep in the living room on the convertible.
Logan.<eos> Logan!<eos> You still have time.<eos> Charles, the world is not the same as it was.<eos> We're taking a risk hanging around here, you know that.
Stay here.<eos> Evening, Mr. Munson.<eos> What brings y'all this way?<eos> Why don't you ask your boys?<eos> Mr. Munson, you understand you're trespassing right now, right?
Looks that way.<eos> He's a friend of mine.<eos> A friend with a big mouth.<eos> I hear that a lot.<eos> Then you probably hear this, too.
A friend with a big mouth.<eos> I hear that a lot.<eos> Then you probably hear this, too.<eos> More than I'd like.<eos> Then you know the drill.
I hear that a lot.<eos> Then you probably hear this, too.<eos> More than I'd like.<eos> Then you know the drill.<eos> I'mma count to three, and you're gonna start walking away.
- Three.<eos> - Ah.<eos> Ah.<eos> You all right, boss?<eos> You know the drill.
Get the hell out of here.<eos> - You okay, boss?<eos> - Fuck off.<eos> Go!<eos> You've had training.
So we just kept on running away from it.<eos> I think I finally understand you.<eos> Logan...<eos> He's fantastic.<eos> You said you only needed the girl!
He's fantastic.<eos> You said you only needed the girl!<eos> I told you I was forced to bring a new tool to bear.<eos> Your friends had every chance.<eos> And so did you.
There's so few of you left.<eos> Nice to meet you, too, Doc.<eos> But I really got to get on my way.<eos> No, no, don't do that.<eos> What you need is rest, and treatment.
No, no, don't do that.<eos> What you need is rest, and treatment.<eos> You need to check yourself in somewhere.<eos> - I'll be fine. - No, you're not!<eos> I mean, I know that you're different... but that doesn't change the fact that something inside you is poisoning you.
What you need is rest, and treatment.<eos> You need to check yourself in somewhere.<eos> - I'll be fine. - No, you're not!<eos> I mean, I know that you're different... but that doesn't change the fact that something inside you is poisoning you.<eos> You got to check yourself into a hospital.
I mean, I know that you're different... but that doesn't change the fact that something inside you is poisoning you.<eos> You got to check yourself into a hospital.<eos> Find out what it is!<eos> I know what it is.<eos> Please, mister, if you don't want to go to a hospital, maybe I can help you.
I know what it is.<eos> Please, mister, if you don't want to go to a hospital, maybe I can help you.<eos> Maybe I can run some tests.<eos> Look, Doc.<eos> You seem like a nice guy, all right?
We understand the importance of containment, Dr. Rice.<eos> But you can't leave a war zone behind like you did in Juárez.<eos> Well, try to remind yourselves that these are all little killing machines. Machines who would've happily disemboweled your family.<eos> Not all.<eos> I was told you want these assets off-board, dead or alive.
They gave it to us when we would fight. It makes you stronger.<eos> It makes you crazy, is what it does.<eos> It'll kill you.<eos> No, not if you use it in small doses.<eos> It's helping you heal.
Hey, pal.<eos> How long have I been out?<eos> How long have I been in that bed?<eos> Two days.<eos> You've been sitting here for two days?
How long have I been in that bed?<eos> Two days.<eos> You've been sitting here for two days?<eos> Hey, go inside and tell everyone to get packing.<eos> You can't do that. You can't just stay here.
You can't do that. You can't just stay here.<eos> We had to wait.<eos> It was the plan.<eos> And everyone had till today to find their way here.<eos> If you keep waiting, Alkali will find you and they will kill you all.
We had to wait.<eos> It was the plan.<eos> And everyone had till today to find their way here.<eos> If you keep waiting, Alkali will find you and they will kill you all.<eos> You need to get out!
Mm-hmm.<eos> That's the border.<eos> That's where we will be safe.<eos> Come inside.<eos> Laura told me all that you did for her.
Laura told me all that you did for her.<eos> She was lucky to have you.<eos> Take it.<eos> She says it's yours.<eos> That's why you did it, right?
She says it's yours.<eos> That's why you did it, right?<eos> Yeah, well...<eos> Look, I don't need it.<eos> You do, okay?
Be hard to keep them claws out, soon.<eos> Waste this dick, Logan!<eos> Please stop, Mr. Howlett.<eos> I'm gonna have to tell these men to fire on these children.<eos> You don't want that.
Please stop, Mr. Howlett.<eos> I'm gonna have to tell these men to fire on these children.<eos> You don't want that.<eos> You can see the effects of the serum are wearing off.<eos> You will not survive further wounds.
We embarked on our next endeavor.<eos> Growing mutants of your own.<eos> - Precisely.<eos> - Dangerous times, James.<eos> You can't...
There'll be a golden ladder reaching down<eos> When the man comes around<eos> The hairs on your arm will stand up<eos> At the terror in each sip and in each sup<eos> For you partake of that last offered cup
Shit don't even voice activate.<eos> That was awkward.<eos> "It takes courage to grow up and to become who you really are."<eos> Right? E.E. Cummings wrote that.<eos> And, guys, you're growing up.
That was awkward.<eos> "It takes courage to grow up and to become who you really are."<eos> Right? E.E. Cummings wrote that.<eos> And, guys, you're growing up.<eos> You're moving on.
Oh, I've literally never seen that before.<eos> - Oh, yeah. You want more?<eos> - What the fuck?<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> Why did you open the door?
I'm gonna go down to the next step.<eos> Maybe I'll just power on the...<eos> - Farewell, you bastard.<eos> I think I see what's going on here.<eos> Mr. Strickland, you are the victim of a senior prank.
Who did it?<eos> It was you!<eos> It was you, wasn't it?<eos> Give me that phone!<eos> I don't have one. You just broke mine, remember?
I don't have time for this today.<eos> I've got 30 termination meetings today alone.<eos> Everything in my office is glued to something else.<eos> I got drawers filled, filled with Silly String.<eos> You see that?
Make it the whole way.<eos> E.E. Cummings said that.<eos> And words are gonna matter for you guys.<eos> Yes, Nathaniel.<eos> Is it true you're gonna fight Mr. Strickland?
He's right.<eos> He can't be taking no punches.<eos> - Right?<eos> - No.<eos> You see those twins out there?
Well, if it's going to occur after school, then it's not really my jurisdiction because I'm the school security guard and not the world security guard.<eos> Oh, come on, man...<eos> I don't, like, try and stop terrorist attacks or...<eos> I'm just asking you to do your job here.<eos> You're asking me to do the job of security guard after 3:00, when I'm not...
Oh, come on, man...<eos> I don't, like, try and stop terrorist attacks or...<eos> I'm just asking you to do your job here.<eos> You're asking me to do the job of security guard after 3:00, when I'm not...<eos> So you're telling me that there's nothing you can do?
But again, only if it's during school hours.<eos> - Yeah. Okay.<eos> Look.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> If it's after school hours, you're just gonna lay there all night until 7:00 a.m., when I'll come and save your life.
- Yeah.<eos> If it's after school hours, you're just gonna lay there all night until 7:00 a.m., when I'll come and save your life.<eos> Shit.<eos> All right.<eos> You cussed.
I got this.<eos> Very well.<eos> That bitch crazy.<eos> Okay, Neil, so I think if you talk to Principal Tyler and just kind of reverse that story, everything will get worked out.<eos> So you want me to say I just made the whole thing up?
I've been practicing all the moves!<eos> - Oh! - You know what I mean? I got them down!<eos> I'm not gonna let you down. Right? Okay?<eos> And see, there's the smile I need!<eos> - See, now you're happy and you're happy.
Yeah, but if you don't want the job, what is the...<eos> Kill the motherfucker today. I swear to God.<eos> Okay, so right off the bat, I'm noticing that Campbell, you're sitting at Israel. And Strickland, you've chosen Iran.<eos> Okay, I'm wondering if that's maybe sending a hostile message.<eos> You know, if we can get you to an ally country, you know, Italy or Spain or France.
Yes, hi.<eos> There's a crazy guy at my high school.<eos> He's trying to beat me up.<eos> Nine-one-one is for emergencies only.<eos> If you have a problem with a bully, I need you to speak to a teacher.
No... I am a teacher.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> It's actually another teacher who's gonna beat me up after school,<eos> - so that's why I'm calling.<eos> - I'm sorry, can you repeat what you just told me?
So, I need help.<eos> Oh, very funny!<eos> Assault is a real thing.<eos> I would like you to stop laughing and listen to my...<eos> You're a grown man.
Fuck!<eos> It takes courage... To become... People when you're older.<eos> And words are... Use... Useless.<eos> Apparently.<eos> Guys, you know, look, you try to be a nice guy, right?
Apparently.<eos> Guys, you know, look, you try to be a nice guy, right?<eos> And treat everyone with respect, but you don't get it.<eos> You don't get it back in return.<eos> You know why?
Your teachers are fucking nuts!<eos> Man, this is fucked up.<eos> He's having a breakdown.<eos> - We can't prank him. - Shh!<eos> And you're gonna say, "Hey, I'm a nice guy.
Campbell, you have to train a dog to smell specific drugs, okay?<eos> How do you think this thing works?<eos> I don't know how it works. I thought you guys knew how it worked.<eos> We do.<eos> Well, if you do, you should have told me. What the...
I just said "hello" back.<eos> He said "hello," I said "hello."<eos> Let's move past that.<eos> Just arrest... Arrest the guy.<eos> Campbell, you've had your say.
Yeah. We're done here.<eos> Anyway, it's an executive course right by the airport, right?<eos> Okay, thanks for the job, I guess.<eos> Step tight. Pop! You know.<eos> I'm sorry though. What cuts are you gonna make?
Well, all right. I may be just a teacher, but I'm pretty sure that qualifies me to ask a goddamn question about something that's gonna affect my ability to fucking teach!<eos> Campbell, get your ass out of here while you still got a job!<eos> No, I can't do it, man, because I'm done listening to you.<eos> And I know I'm just a teacher, but that ought to be worth something around here.<eos> In fact, that ought to be worth everything to you guys, but instead, you treat us like shit.
Campbell, get your ass out of here while you still got a job!<eos> No, I can't do it, man, because I'm done listening to you.<eos> And I know I'm just a teacher, but that ought to be worth something around here.<eos> In fact, that ought to be worth everything to you guys, but instead, you treat us like shit.<eos> And you don't give us the tools to do our jobs properly.
And you don't give us the tools to do our jobs properly.<eos> And I can't believe I'm saying this, but Strickland's right.<eos> The students are running all over the fucking school.<eos> So this may be just a teacher's opinion, but you guys fucking suck at your jobs.<eos> And if you ever leave me waiting outside again so you can talk about a goddamn fishing trip, I will walk right in here and I'll punch you right in the fucking teeth, Tyler.
You got gas money?<eos> Hey! Hey, you!<eos> What the hell, man? You're just gonna walk away?<eos> Just gonna leave like this? On these terms?<eos> What the hell are you talking about?
Is that an unlikeable thing to do?<eos> Yeah!<eos> But boo-fucking-hoo!<eos> I can be a dick, too.<eos> You wanna see me be a dick?
That's not technically a song.<eos> That's kinda like a rap.<eos> It still sound good, don't it?<eos> It did! It did.<eos> Why you keep shaking your legs like you got something down there
It still sound good, don't it?<eos> It did! It did.<eos> Why you keep shaking your legs like you got something down there<eos> - moving.<eos> - Because you make me nervous.
Read!<eos> Gujarat...<eos> - In the north of Gujarat...<eos> - Come here.<eos> I don't want to, but you boys compel me to beat you.
- No one escapes!<eos> - Greetings!<eos> - Spread out! - Not again!<eos> - Find out where he's hidden the liquor!<eos> - Are you looking for some treasure?
Come here.<eos> You like to whistle, eh?<eos> Shall I make you whistle? What say?<eos> Hey!<eos> - Why did you slap him?
- Well, it isn't settled yet.<eos> What's up, bro?<eos> Come over here.<eos> - Your pockets were empty, I filled them. - Right.<eos> You gave me a flat, now fix it.
- Excuse me...<eos> - Beat the drum!<eos> Whose guest are you?<eos> Mr Serpent?<eos> Whose guest are you?
- Beat the drum!<eos> Whose guest are you?<eos> Mr Serpent?<eos> Whose guest are you?<eos> Excuse me. Whose guest are you?
I am Hasmukh bhai's guest. Whose guest are you?<eos> - I am Hasmukhbhai.<eos> - You are Hasmukh bhai?<eos> Yes.<eos> - You are Hasmukh bhai? - That's me.
- Jairaj Seth's consignment.<eos> Kodnani has got his cut.<eos> Sir, this truck is loaded with liquor.<eos> Park the truck.<eos> You've got your truckload, sir.
It was Jairaj's stuff, soon it will be ours.<eos> Don't take him lightly. A huge consignment is due.<eos> Raees.<eos> Inspector Majmudar wants to see Raees.<eos> You look different in the picture, sir.
Raees.<eos> Inspector Majmudar wants to see Raees.<eos> You look different in the picture, sir.<eos> Well, they say I'm quite photogenic.<eos> You know whose consignment it was?
You look different in the picture, sir.<eos> Well, they say I'm quite photogenic.<eos> You know whose consignment it was?<eos> Jairaj's.<eos> You worked for him, didn't you?
- I see.<eos> The truck number is GAF 1722.<eos> Okay.<eos> Tea from a cop station. Get used to it.<eos> You'd better shut shop. Or, I'll make it difficult for you to even breathe.
Tea from a cop station. Get used to it.<eos> You'd better shut shop. Or, I'll make it difficult for you to even breathe.<eos> The air of Gujarat is replete with business.<eos> You can stop me from breathing. Can you stop the air?<eos> At this rate, you will soon run into trouble.
Yes. Tell me.<eos> I have information about Raees.<eos> Go on.<eos> A huge consignment of Raees is arriving tomorrow, sir.<eos> If you bust it, he'll be completely ruined.
I can't believe my eyes.<eos> My heart desires to feel you.<eos> Sir, this is the beginning of organized crime.<eos> If Raees isn't stopped now, he'll burn the whole of Gujarat.<eos> After this terrible incident under your jurisdiction, are you teaching me?
Sir, this is the beginning of organized crime.<eos> If Raees isn't stopped now, he'll burn the whole of Gujarat.<eos> After this terrible incident under your jurisdiction, are you teaching me?<eos> Now you give me in writing why I shouldn't be transferring you!<eos> You can transfer me anywhere
After this terrible incident under your jurisdiction, are you teaching me?<eos> Now you give me in writing why I shouldn't be transferring you!<eos> You can transfer me anywhere<eos> I won't spare Raees.<eos> You can take that in writing!
The mill shut down.<eos> The owner even refused compensation.<eos> He's gone!<eos> 'So what if five laborers die? '<eos> 'You will employ twenty-five more' to fill your coffers'
- There's ice-cream for everyone, guys. - Okay, sir.<eos> Raees, he is Mr Hasmukh.<eos> He is into construction.<eos> He executes all the government projects<eos> I wanted you to meet him.
Raees, he is Mr Hasmukh.<eos> He is into construction.<eos> He executes all the government projects<eos> I wanted you to meet him.<eos> You know Damla Seth.
You know Damla Seth.<eos> - Aasiya, this is the CM.<eos> - Hello.<eos> Let's have a drink.<eos> You drink like a fish here, and in the parliament, you take to sloganeering 'Ban liquor, save Gujarat'
Can it be done?<eos> Surely, if it's the CM's wish<eos> I'll take 30 percent.<eos> Deal, Raees.<eos> You are right, sir.
Deal, Raees.<eos> You are right, sir.<eos> Damla is here with Raees.<eos> The Chief Minister and Pasha Bhai are also here.<eos> You quit the city but you haven't forgotten Raees.
Hot news.<eos> Before it cools down, break it to the press.<eos> 'Raees issues an open threat'<eos> 'If Pasha takes out a procession, it will be his final journey'<eos> You torched his castle, and he has no idea what hit him!
Raees is your friend while Pasha Bhai is your rival.<eos> - Did Raees act on your orders?<eos> - Gujarat politics hasn't stooped so low.<eos> - The police are doing their job.<eos> - You don't let the police do their job.
- Of course.<eos> But the amount is too big for all of us.<eos> Qasim, who is asking for the entire amount?<eos> You don't need to pay the entire amount now.<eos> You have to pay only half the amount. And the rest in ten years.
But the amount is too big for all of us.<eos> Qasim, who is asking for the entire amount?<eos> You don't need to pay the entire amount now.<eos> You have to pay only half the amount. And the rest in ten years.<eos> You can pay in monthly installments for the next ten years.
You can pay in monthly installments for the next ten years.<eos> Is ten years too short a period?<eos> Don't worry, don't be apprehensive<eos> I guarantee you. This is my neighborhood, you are my people.<eos> You own your house from the very first day.
Come here, kid.<eos> It might change your perception. Cheers.<eos> To me, you are still the same.<eos> I have changed a bit, Mr Majmudar.<eos> - You can't tap this politician's phones now.
All your hands are tied.<eos> That's why I came here to reason with you. Make sure you don't give me an opportunity.<eos> Never. I never gave you one.<eos> Hang on, SP.<eos> If you say, here, in Our World, I'll book an apartment for you
They are our people.<eos> Neither the free meals will stop nor the construction of Our World<eos> I'll organize the money.<eos> Stop the meals, my foot!<eos> Mr CM, I agree you have the riots under control.
Last time he was jailed, he came out a politician.<eos> God knows what he'll try this time.<eos> Even I want Raees, sir.<eos> To maintain peace, war is a must this time, sir.<eos> I can't give what you seek in writing, Majmudar.
But right now, this is the right thing to do.<eos> But...<eos> I won't run.<eos> I don't know, sir!<eos> You can break our bodies but not our resolve!
Come, Bhaijaan.<eos> Who called?<eos> It was Raees, right?<eos> Why did you call him here, Sadiq?<eos> What are you going to do with Raees?
- Take care. - Take him away.<eos> When you knew how this was going to end for you, why did you return?<eos> Would you have spared my people if I didn't?<eos> I had to return to save my flesh and blood.<eos> But what you are about to do, Mr Majmudar...!
I had to return to save my flesh and blood.<eos> But what you are about to do, Mr Majmudar...!<eos> Well?<eos> What happened?<eos> You don't trust the system anymore?
-What do you see?<eos> I can't see anything, sir.<eos> We lost a lot of men and captain is dead, sir.<eos> Calm down.<eos> You're in command now.
Colonel, I don't think I'm gonna make it, sir.<eos> I am sorry.<eos> I am so sorry, sir.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> Kill as many as you can.
No.<eos> No, no!<eos> 63 dead.<eos> You are him.<eos> You're Caesar.
63 dead.<eos> You are him.<eos> You're Caesar.<eos> We've been searching for you for so long.<eos> We heard you had a hidden command base, but we could never find it.
You are him.<eos> You're Caesar.<eos> We've been searching for you for so long.<eos> We heard you had a hidden command base, but we could never find it.<eos> Some of us were starting to think that you might be dead, but the Colonel McCullough said you were out here somewhere.
They tried to kill me.<eos> They fear what I will do to them.<eos> So now they serve you... just to survive.<eos> I no fear you!<eos> You must fear!
Take this traitor outside!<eos> What should we do with the humans?<eos> You are letting us go?<eos> Tell your Colonel...<eos> you have seen me now.
What I didn't see that he could not forgive what humans did to him.<eos> No one could have known how much darkness... was living inside him.<eos> Father!<eos> Welcome home, Rocket.<eos> You look tired.
Have you found Cornelius yet?<eos> We're still searching.<eos> Let's go look for Caesar's little son.<eos> Come, Cornelius.<eos> You're safe now.
You're safe now.<eos> Lake.<eos> You loved my son.<eos> Look after his brother, until I return.<eos> You're not coming with us to our new home?
You're not coming with us to our new home?<eos> No.<eos> Go with Lake.<eos> Caesar!<eos> You're not going after them? !
Go with Lake.<eos> Caesar!<eos> You're not going after them? !<eos> Not them, him.<eos> Caesar, you are our leader!
You're not going after them? !<eos> Not them, him.<eos> Caesar, you are our leader!<eos> We can't leave without you!<eos> You must.
You must.<eos> The soldiers will be back soon.<eos> Father!<eos> When I find him, the soldiers will all come after me.<eos> That makes you the best chance to get out of woods.
Just gonna put this down.<eos> What's he doing out here alone?<eos> Maybe he's a deserter?<eos> Look around.<eos> Take what you can.
Why?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But the rest of us are going tomorrow.<eos> Donkeys think the soldiers from the North are coming to help finish off the apes for good.<eos> That day, after the battle on the hill, the donkey we caught promised me the Colonel would spare my life if I told them where you were hiding.
Ape get smart.<eos> Then human kill ape.<eos> But not me.<eos> I run.<eos> You learned to speak?
Very safe here.<eos> Never go back!<eos> No!<eos> -Please.<eos> You must take us.
Look!<eos> More snow.<eos> Cannot go.<eos> Must stay.<eos> You eat, you rest, stay here.
Must stay.<eos> You eat, you rest, stay here.<eos> With me.<eos> Here.<eos> You keep.
But she with you?<eos> She has no one else.<eos> I see you look at her just now.<eos> Look sad.<eos> You have child?
We cannot turn back!<eos> Luca gave his life.<eos> Please!<eos> They must pay.<eos> Now... you sound like Koba.
My little son is here.<eos> Grant... and Lee.<eos> Wellington... and Napoleon.<eos> Custer and Sitting Bull...<eos> You're probably not much of a reader, but this is a big moment.
God.<eos> Look at your eyes.<eos> Almost human.<eos> How did you know I was here?<eos> -I was told you were coming.
Back to work!<eos> String him up, donkey.<eos> Bad place.<eos> Bad, bad place.<eos> What you see?
What would Caesar do?<eos> No!<eos> Why so small?<eos> What did the Colonel promised you?<eos> You really think he let you live?
Why so small?<eos> What did the Colonel promised you?<eos> You really think he let you live?<eos> After we are gone?<eos> You let them call you donkey.
-They'll get food and water when they finish their work.<eos> Give apes food and water.<eos> Or they cannot finish it.<eos> -You know, you're very emotional.<eos> What makes you think you're in a position to make demands?
What makes you think you're in a position to make demands?<eos> Okay, let's go.<eos> -The soldiers who are coming here, they are not coming to join you, are they?<eos> I saw men outside, on the wall, preparing for battle.<eos> They told me you're smart, but that's impressive.
No, they won't be joining me.<eos> They are against you?<eos> They fear me.<eos> Why?<eos> Because you kill your own men?
Why?<eos> Because you kill your own men?<eos> We found bodies.<eos> Something wrong with these men.<eos> Jesus Christ, you are impressive.
Because you kill your own men?<eos> We found bodies.<eos> Something wrong with these men.<eos> Jesus Christ, you are impressive.<eos> You paint quite a picture.
We found bodies.<eos> Something wrong with these men.<eos> Jesus Christ, you are impressive.<eos> You paint quite a picture.<eos> What you must think of me.
Something wrong with these men.<eos> Jesus Christ, you are impressive.<eos> You paint quite a picture.<eos> What you must think of me.<eos> I think you have no mercy.
I showed you mercy when I spared your men.<eos> I offered you peace and you killed my family.<eos> Mercy.<eos> Do you have any idea what your mercy would do to us?<eos> You're much stronger than we are.
Mercy.<eos> Do you have any idea what your mercy would do to us?<eos> You're much stronger than we are.<eos> You're smart as hell.<eos> No matter what you say, you'd eventually replace us.
And if it spread, it would destroy humanity for good this time.<eos> Not by killing us, but by robbing us of the things that make us human.<eos> Our speech, our higher thinking.<eos> It would turn us into beasts.<eos> You talk about mercy?
Others with children deserted into the woods.<eos> One of those cowards fled to my superiors up north.<eos> They tried to convince me that this plague could be dealt with medically.<eos> That's when I realized that they had learned nothing from our past.<eos> You killed them too?

But if his destiny was to inherit your unholy kingdom...<eos> I am glad I did.<eos> Get back!<eos> So emotional!<eos> I see how conflicted you are.
I am glad I did.<eos> Get back!<eos> So emotional!<eos> I see how conflicted you are.<eos> You are confused in your purpose.
So emotional!<eos> I see how conflicted you are.<eos> You are confused in your purpose.<eos> You're angry at me for something I did that was an act of war.<eos> But you're taking this all much far too personally.
Friend!<eos> Friend!<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you, friend.<eos> You save our lives!
Come!<eos> Come, come!<eos> Koba...<eos> Sleep.<eos> You cannot save them.
-Yes.<eos> Join me...<eos> If he's still alive in the morning...<eos> He goes back to work as everyone else.<eos> Or you shoot him.
I save myself.<eos> Is there anything left of you to safe?<eos> Up!<eos> Apes going back to the cage?<eos> You are very brave.
Brave!<eos> Ape?<eos> Me?<eos> Ape?<eos> You are...
Hurry!<eos> Let's go!<eos> Caesar, what's wrong?<eos> Hurry.<eos> You must go.
THE BEGINNING THE END<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Maurice...<eos> You are home now.
Woo-hoo!<eos> We're already here!<eos> Agents Grucy are closing in fast.<eos> Yes... wait, wha?<eos> What did you call us?
Agents Grucy are closing in fast.<eos> Yes... wait, wha?<eos> What did you call us?<eos> Grucy.<eos> You know, Gru and Lucy mushed together.
Hello, Gru.<eos> How's your transition coming?<eos> You know, from world's worst villain to world's worst agent?<eos> Oh, that's hilarious!<eos> You should be on TV!
How's your transition coming?<eos> You know, from world's worst villain to world's worst agent?<eos> Oh, that's hilarious!<eos> You should be on TV!<eos> Oh, that's right, you were... but then you got canceled.
Dangling there in the bubble-gum Speedo.<eos> And I didn't have time to go to the gym this week!<eos> And I had a big breakfast!<eos> I was feeling a little bloated!<eos> You know what?
- I...<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Blah blah blah.<eos> We understand.<eos> You're old, you're fat, you're done.
Huh!<eos> What?<eos> This is totally not fair.<eos> Gru is a great agent.<eos> You know what?
What?<eos> This is totally not fair.<eos> Gru is a great agent.<eos> You know what?<eos> If you fire him, you're going to have to fire me, sister sister.
Do ya?<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> Well, I guess she did!<eos> Honey, you didn't have to do that.<eos> I know how much you love your job.
Well, I guess she did!<eos> Honey, you didn't have to do that.<eos> I know how much you love your job.<eos> Well, I love other things more.<eos> You know, we're going to have to tell the girls.
- Aloha!<eos> - Aloha!<eos> Oh!<eos> This is unexpected.<eos> Well, you never got to go on a honeymoon, so...
I'm sure we'll get new jobs real soon.<eos> Even better ones.<eos> What's better than being super-cool secret agents?<eos> Oh, I know!<eos> You could gamble online!
That's a good suggestion.<eos> And let's not go over to Katie's house anymore.<eos> Hmm.<eos> Guys, shhhhhh.<eos> I don't think you heard me right.
No, no, no, no, no, no, this does not mean that we are going back to being villains.<eos> - Oh.<eos> - Oh.<eos> Boring!<eos> You weren't like this!
Look, I know it's been a little tough lately, especially with Doctor Nefario accidentally freezing himself in carbonite,<eos> Ow!<eos> but our life of crime is over!<eos> Mel.<eos> Mel, you're with me on this, right?
Look, if you guys don't stop that right now, there will be consequences!<eos> Huh!<eos> I can do whatever I want.<eos> Hey.<eos> Don't say anything you're going to regret.
I quit!<eos> See you!<eos> What?<eos> You quit?<eos> You're serious?
Dave!<eos> Jerry!<eos> Great news, guys...<eos> you've been promoted.<eos> You're in charge now, eh?
Hey, Gru, whatcha doing down here?<eos> In the dark.<eos> Alone.<eos> Oh nothing, just thinking.<eos> You okay?
It's just...<eos> I don't know.<eos> I guess I just feel like a... failure.<eos> Like I don't have a purpose anymore.<eos> Hey, mister, you are not a failure.
If only I could've nailed Bratt.<eos> So many times I almost had him!<eos> But now I'll never get the chance.<eos> 'Cause I have been kicked to the curb.<eos> Gru, you've got to let this go.
Would you tell me how to get to this address?<eos> Uh.<eos> Huh!<eos> What?<eos> You are looking for Minions?
Stop!<eos> Kyle, let go.<eos> BRATT STEALS WORLD'S BIGGEST DIAMOND<eos> No, no...<eos> you've got to be kidding me.
So, take good care of him.<eos> Thank you!<eos> Agnes, what are you doing?<eos> You...<eos> You sold your unicorn?
Agnes, what are you doing?<eos> You...<eos> You sold your unicorn?<eos> Well, I just wanted to help.<eos> Since you don't have a job.
- Uh...<eos> Oh.<eos> - Goodbye.<eos> Listen, Agnes.<eos> You don't need to worry.
Now come on, let's pack this stuff up.<eos> Ow.<eos> Ow.<eos> Seriously?<eos> Buddy, you're not getting the hint.
He would like to fly you to Freedonia to meet him.<eos> Your father has recently passed away and...<eos> Okay, cuckoo.<eos> I'm sorry, but my dad died when I was a baby, and I don't have any brother.<eos> You've got the wrong guy.
Bellissimo!<eos> - Oh, hello, Gru.<eos> - Hi, Mom.<eos> It's important to keep active in one's golden years.<eos> There you are, you cute cute.
I'll just sit here and play solitaire.<eos> I hope I win.<eos> I wonder what Dru will be like!<eos> Woo!<eos> Maybe we'll have that twin thing where we can read each other's minds, you know?
After all these years, finally I'm meeting you!<eos> - Yup, alright, good.<eos> - Oh, look at that!<eos> - Woo!<eos> - You must be the beautiful wife!
How is my brother finding a wife like you when he is so bald?<eos> Woo-hoo!<eos> These must be my nieces!<eos> Huh!<eos> You're Agnes, you're small with big eyes!
These must be my nieces!<eos> Huh!<eos> You're Agnes, you're small with big eyes!<eos> And it makes me want to put you in my pocket!<eos> You can't do that.
And it makes me want to put you in my pocket!<eos> You can't do that.<eos> I'm too big.<eos> And Edith,<eos> I can tell that you are a little mischievous.
Ow!<eos> Ow.<eos> Fist bump for mischievous behavior.<eos> And Margo!<eos> Oh, you are so mature.
Bye!<eos> You boys have fun.<eos> Ha ha ha!<eos> Whoopee!<eos> Now you can be as evil as Balthazar Bratt with the evil Bratt action figure, featuring music activated Break Dance mode.
So how are things going for you, career-wise?<eos> Ahhaaaaa... great.<eos> So, so great.<eos> Crushing it.<eos> Well, I've got something that I think you will find very interesting.
He was known as the Bald terror.<eos> That's him?<eos> Our dad?<eos> He was so proud of you.<eos> And what a great villain you were.
But me...<eos> not so much<eos> To Dad, I was just a failure.<eos> He never thought I had what it took to be a villain.<eos> But now you can help me prove him wrong.
No, no, no.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> What?<eos> But it's our family tradition!<eos> You can't say no to that!
Lucy, can we get these please?<eos> Okay, but only one each.<eos> I mean it.<eos> No, I don't!<eos> Get as many as you want,
- Yay!<eos> Awesome!<eos> - Um.<eos> - What?<eos> It's okay to tell them no sometimes, too, you know.
Right.<eos> Right, tough.<eos> Good one.<eos> I can totally do that.<eos> You know, still figuring out this mom thing.
Whoa, they're back!<eos> Man, that was crazy!<eos> - We're so close to getting busted.<eos> - Tell me about it.<eos> I thought you were going to pee your pants!
Don't move!<eos> Hands in the air!<eos> Face it, Gru.<eos> Villainy is in your blood.<eos> You can't tell me you don't miss the rush.
You can't tell me you don't miss the rush.<eos> A little?<eos> Well...<eos> Yeah, maybe a little.<eos> And now you've got a chance to get back on top.
Get your mojo back.<eos> Become Gru again!<eos> How awesome would that be?<eos> Oh please, come on, just one heist.<eos> There's got to be something out there, somewhere, that you still want to steal.
I love it!<eos> Oh, thank you, Brother!<eos> Thank you from the bottom of my heart!<eos> Oh!<eos> You know what?
- Sentences?<eos> - Sentences?<eos> Aw, that's delightful.<eos> Not creepy at all.<eos> And you're gonna stop now, though, right?
For reals.<eos> If I do, can I bring it home, please?<eos> Ohhh.<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> Tell you what, every unicorn you find, you can bring it home.
Ohhh.<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> Tell you what, every unicorn you find, you can bring it home.<eos> I'd better build a big pen, right?<eos> But you know... there's a chance that you might not find one.
Gum all.<eos> Seriously, how did this show never win an Emmy?<eos> And now, it's your turn to shine, my diamond!<eos> Hey, Clive.<eos> I guess you can say our plan was... out of this world.
Ha ha ha ha ha!<eos> Ah...<eos> Good to know.<eos> So here's the plan.<eos> You're the getaway driver.
Wait in the boat?<eos> But...<eos> I want to be in on the actions!<eos> The getaway driver is the most crucial part of any plan.<eos> Do you know how hard it is doing nothing, touching nothing, with all of the adrenaline coursing through your veins... and you must wait.
- Hey, what now? - What's going on? Remember, little boots?<eos> - Hello, my schmoopsie poo.<eos> - Whoa!<eos> Hey!<eos> He seems to think you're engaged.
We're not engaged!<eos> Look, Niko.<eos> You seem like a very nice boy<eos> With a very nice pig.<eos> Uh, but you're not engaged.
Right, but it's over now, so...<eos> Ugh, here we go.<eos> Niko...<eos> You!<eos> You refuse my son's engagement pig?
Alright, lady.<eos> That's it!<eos> Nobody... nobody!<eos> ...curses my daughter!<eos> You got that?
Nobody... nobody!<eos> ...curses my daughter!<eos> You got that?<eos> Because if you mess with Margo, you mess with me!<eos> And I promise, you do not want to mess with me!
...curses my daughter!<eos> You got that?<eos> Because if you mess with Margo, you mess with me!<eos> And I promise, you do not want to mess with me!<eos> Do you understand me?
Just a couple more hours!<eos> We have to be home before it gets dark.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> I did exactly what the man said.<eos> You mean that one-eyed, scar-faced man that everybody laughed at?
You're amazing!<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I'm so embarrassed.<eos> I was very rude.<eos> - And you were always such a gentleman.
I was very rude.<eos> - And you were always such a gentleman.<eos> - You did it!<eos> You did it!<eos> You got our jobs back.
Fine...<eos> - Hey, brother.<eos> - What?<eos> I told you, you were supposed to stay with the boat!<eos> Oh, I didn't think you meant that literally.
Ha ha.<eos> Follow me!<eos> Ha ha.<eos> Look out!<eos> You're right.
I shouldn't have eaten that hot pie.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> Relax.<eos> You're going to be just fine.
Take it to the AVL and get our jobs back!<eos> Wait!<eos> What?<eos> That's amazing!<eos> And the best part is you are never ever go behind my back ever again!
No.<eos> No way!<eos> We can't give the diamond back!<eos> - I have to.<eos> - No, you don't!
You kicked me!<eos> You-You lied to me.<eos> Hey.<eos> I would have told you the truth.<eos> But you're too much of a wimp to handle it.
Hey.<eos> I would have told you the truth.<eos> But you're too much of a wimp to handle it.<eos> That's it, I'm out of here.<eos> You have no right to take that, we stole it together.
But you're too much of a wimp to handle it.<eos> That's it, I'm out of here.<eos> You have no right to take that, we stole it together.<eos> Together?<eos> You got to be kidding me.
I got this in spite of you.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Well, at least I didn't get fired from my job like a total loser.<eos> At least I had a job.<eos> What have you accomplished that was so great?
At least I had a job.<eos> What have you accomplished that was so great?<eos> I'll tell you what:<eos> Nothing!<eos> No wonder Dad thought you were such a failure.
But-But he has one horn.<eos> I'm-I'm sorry, sweetie, but... he's just a goat.<eos> Life is just like that sometimes.<eos> We're hoping for a unicorn and we get a goat.<eos> Well, you know what?
Lucky is the best goat in the whole wide world!<eos> Look at that face!<eos> I just want to squeeze it.<eos> I'll take this.<eos> You've been a bad boy, Gru.
I'm back and bigger than ever.<eos> I'm scared!<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you so...<eos> You can't leave me here!
I love it when a plan comes together.<eos> Aaaah!<eos> It's Gru!<eos> Get ready, Bratt.<eos> You're about to be blasted back to the 80s.
What's happening?<eos> Dru!<eos> Hold on!<eos> I'm coming!<eos> You've ruined everything.
I'm coming!<eos> You've ruined everything.<eos> And now, it's time to die.<eos> Any last words, Gru?<eos> You know what?
Enough!<eos> My turn.<eos> Oh oh.<eos> Game over!<eos> Is this what you're looking for?
Three consecutive tours.<eos> Sangin, huh.<eos> Was it as bad as they say?<eos> Yes. Injuries?<eos> Anything you're not physically capable of doing? None.
Sangin, huh.<eos> Was it as bad as they say?<eos> Yes. Injuries?<eos> Anything you're not physically capable of doing? None.<eos> Anything you don't like doing?
I will do anything, ma'am,<eos> I mean anything. Listen I go through this every day and it never gets any easier.<eos> Just do me a favor.<eos> Plug minimum wage into my profile there.<eos> But you're a Captain so you're entitled to...
That's 1.25 million in unmarked, untraceable American currency.<eos> Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!<eos> Hey, hey, hey!<eos> You wipe the camera memory, say it was the storm.<eos> You never saw me, the girl was never here.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!<eos> Hey, hey, hey!<eos> You wipe the camera memory, say it was the storm.<eos> You never saw me, the girl was never here.<eos> And you do what with her?
Nothing good, Vance.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> And why not?<eos> Because she's just a... - Because it's not right?<eos> Which is less right, Vance; one pain in the ass girl out of your hair and you getting rich, or every last one of you dying horribly and nobody getting rich?
Because she's just a... - Because it's not right?<eos> Which is less right, Vance; one pain in the ass girl out of your hair and you getting rich, or every last one of you dying horribly and nobody getting rich?<eos> Oh fuck me.<eos> And when I say horribly, my dear lord I mean horribly. Back away, Vance.<eos> You step away from these doors your answer is no, got it?

Are you in charge here or are you not?<eos> You said no, so step away.<eos> Come on.<eos> Let me break this down for you.<eos> You're five mall cops armed with Tasers and zip ties.
You said no, so step away.<eos> Come on.<eos> Let me break this down for you.<eos> You're five mall cops armed with Tasers and zip ties.<eos> You have no cell signal or outside lines.
Let me break this down for you.<eos> You're five mall cops armed with Tasers and zip ties.<eos> You have no cell signal or outside lines.<eos> And in case you hadn't noticed and whatever regular nightly police patrol you have simply isn't coming.<eos> You can't keep us out, you can't keep her alive.
What?<eos> Internet, man.<eos> Let's get to work! Ruby you hide in the perfume store.<eos> Vance you go to the kitchen wares.<eos> You are the first line of defense.
Let's get to work! Ruby you hide in the perfume store.<eos> Vance you go to the kitchen wares.<eos> You are the first line of defense.<eos> Mason you head to the home and garden store. You are the lookout.<eos> All you gotta do is stay enough time distracting them until the feds gets here.
Over. Clear the Food Court.<eos> Listen, everybody.<eos> We just lost Johnnie.<eos> They are not joking.<eos> I want you to be very careful.
I don't know.<eos> But right now- there isn't anyone I'd feel safer with.<eos> Let's have a little chat, shall we?<eos> Go.<eos> So now you're in Clyve's. End of the road. Nowhere else to go and only a single steel door separating us from you.
I'm a high-functioning sociopath.<eos> Merry Christmas!<eos> I'm not given to outbursts of brotherly compassion.<eos> You know what happened to the other one.<eos> Miss me? 'Did you miss me? Did you miss me?
You know what happened to the other one.<eos> Miss me? 'Did you miss me? Did you miss me?<eos> I've only been gone four minutes.<eos> Well, I certainly hope you've learnt your lesson.<eos> What you're about to see is classified beyond top secret.
Well, I certainly hope you've learnt your lesson.<eos> What you're about to see is classified beyond top secret.<eos> Is that quite clear?<eos> Don't minute any of this.<eos> Once beyond these walls, you must never speak of it.
And now I'm back, in a nice warm office, with my big brother and...<eos> Are those ginger nuts?<eos> - Oh, God...<eos> - Love ginger nuts.<eos> Our doctor said you were clean.
I am.<eos> Utterly.<eos> No need for stimulants now, remember?<eos> I have work to do.<eos> You're high as a kite!
We have some very talented people working here.<eos> If James Moriarty can hack every TV screen in the land, rest assured we have the tech to doctor a bit of security footage.<eos> That is now the official version, the version anyone we want to will see.<eos> No need to go to the trouble of getting some sort of official pardon.<eos> You're off the hook, Mr Holmes.

OK, cheers.<eos> Obviously, there's unfinished business.<eos> Moriarty.<eos> I told you - Moriarty's dead.<eos> You say he filmed that video message before he died.
Moriarty.<eos> I told you - Moriarty's dead.<eos> You say he filmed that video message before he died.<eos> Yes.<eos> You also say you know what he's going to do next.
For there he was sure Death could not find him.<eos> But when, at last, he came to Samarra, the merchant saw, waiting for him, the grim figure of Death.<eos> "Very well," said the merchant.<eos> "I give in. I am yours."<eos> "But tell me, why did you look surprised when you saw me this morning in Baghdad?"
Hopkins, arrest Wilson.<eos> Dimmock, look in the lymph nodes.<eos> - 'Wilson? ' 'Lymph nodes? '<eos> - Sherlock...<eos> Yes, you may have nothing but a limbless torso, but there'll be traces of ink in the lymph nodes under the armpits.
Hm, naturally.<eos> Sherlock, you can't go on spinning plates like this.<eos> That's it!<eos> The place was spinning.<eos> The heart medication you're taking is known to cause bouts of amnesia.
- Uh, yeah, we've gone off that.<eos> Have we?<eos> - Oh. - Well, you know what I think...<eos> - It's not a girl's name.<eos> Molly, Mrs H, we would love you to be godparents.
What?<eos> The body in the car, dead for a week.<eos> Oh, this is a good one.<eos> Is it my birthday?<eos> You want help?
- Yes, please. OK.<eos> - One condition.<eos> Take all the credit.<eos> It gets boring if I just solve them all.<eos> Yeah, you say that, but then John blogs about it, and you get all the credit anyway.
- Are you two having a little joke?<eos> - Never a word of thanks.<eos> Can't even tell people's faces apart.<eos> This is a joke, isn't it?<eos> Yeah, and it's all, "Oh, aren't you clever. You're so, so clever."
Perfect opportunity, and look at that one - she's smiling.<eos> Oh, Inspector, this is clearly a waste of time.<eos> - And if there's nothing...<eos> - I know what happened to your son.<eos> You do?
- Exactly.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Don't know. Wouldn't be fun if I knew.<eos> Mr Holmes, please!<eos> It was your 50th birthday, Mr Welsborough, of course you were disappointed that your son hadn't made it back from his gap year.
There were two types of vinyl in the burnt-out remains of the car.<eos> One, the actual passenger seat, the other, a good copy.<eos> Well, good enough.<eos> Effectively a costume.<eos> You're joking?
Well, good enough.<eos> Effectively a costume.<eos> You're joking?<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> All he wanted was for you to get close enough to the car so he could spring the surprise.
- Oh, my God!<eos> - Surprise!<eos> That's when it happened.<eos> I can't be certain, of course, but I think Charlie must have suffered some sort of a seizure.<eos> You said he'd felt unwell?
What kind of a life would that be?<eos> Besides, I have the strangest feeling...<eos> Miss me?<eos> - That's mine.<eos> You two take a... bus.
- Greg.<eos> You, uh...?<eos> - Uh, yeah, he's just got a client, so...<eos> - Right, right, right...<eos> Uh, you see a lot of each other, do you?
Will you two please keep it down?<eos> !<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> Now, you haven't always been in life insurance, have you?
!<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> Now, you haven't always been in life insurance, have you?<eos> You started out in manual labour.
Don't bother being astonished.<eos> Your right hand's almost an entire size bigger than your left - hard manual work does that.<eos> I was a carpenter.<eos> Like me dad.<eos> You're trying to give up smoking - unsuccessfully - and you once had a Japanese girlfriend that meant a lot to you but now you feel indifferent about.
You're trying to give up smoking - unsuccessfully - and you once had a Japanese girlfriend that meant a lot to you but now you feel indifferent about.<eos> How the hell...?<eos> Ah... e-cigarettes.<eos> Not just that - ten individual e-cigarettes.<eos> If you just wanted to smoke indoors, you would've invested in one of those irritating electronic pipe things.

Where were you?<eos> - Helping Mrs H with her sudoku.<eos> What about my girlfriend?<eos> - What?<eos> - You said I had an ex...
- Helping Mrs H with her sudoku.<eos> What about my girlfriend?<eos> - What?<eos> - You said I had an ex...<eos> You've got a Japanese tattoo in the crook of your elbow in the name Akako.
- You said I had an ex...<eos> You've got a Japanese tattoo in the crook of your elbow in the name Akako.<eos> It's obvious you've tried to have it removed.<eos> But surely that means I want to forget her, not that I'm indifferent.<eos> If she'd really hurt your feelings, you would've had the word obliterated.

I've withheld this information from you until now, Mr Kingsley, but I think it's time you knew the truth.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Have you ever wondered if your wife was a little bit out of your league?<eos> - Well...<eos> - You thought she was having an affair.
Go!<eos> - But...<eos> - Go!<eos> - This had better be good.<eos> - Oh, I think you'll like it.
That is the bust, isn't it?<eos> The one that was broken.<eos> No, it's another one, different owner.<eos> Different part of town.<eos> You were right, this is a thing.
Different part of town.<eos> You were right, this is a thing.<eos> Something's going on.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I thought you'd be pleased.
Something's going on.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I thought you'd be pleased.<eos> - I am pleased.<eos> - You don't look pleased.
Why?<eos> - To see Toby.<eos> Ah, right.<eos> Who?<eos> - You'll see.
Trust me, though, she's not right for you.<eos> - What?<eos> - She's not the one.<eos> Well, thank you, Mystic Meg.<eos> How do you work all that out?
- He's not moving.<eos> - He's thinking.<eos> He's really not moving.<eos> Slow but sure, John, not dissimilar to yourself.<eos> You just like this dog, don't you?
No, they're not destroying them, that's not what's happening.<eos> - Yes, it is.<eos> - Well, it is, but it's not the point.<eos> I've been slow, far too slow.<eos> Well, I'm still being slow over here, so if you wouldn't mind...
And since they smashed both busts, our luck might just hold.<eos> Jack Sandeford of Reading is where I'm going next.<eos> Congratulations, by the way.<eos> - I'm sorry?<eos> - Well, you're about to solve a big one.
Daddy has things to do, I'm afraid.<eos> And you need to get to bed.<eos> Come on.<eos> Wouldn't it be much simpler to take out your grievances at the polling station?<eos> You were on the run.
Come on.<eos> Wouldn't it be much simpler to take out your grievances at the polling station?<eos> You were on the run.<eos> Nowhere to hide your precious cargo.<eos> You find yourself in a workshop, plaster busts of the Iron Lady drying, it's clever.
- Tell me about your boss, Moriarty.<eos> - Who?<eos> I know it's him.<eos> It must be him.<eos> You think you understand.
- Who?<eos> I know it's him.<eos> It must be him.<eos> You think you understand.<eos> You understand nothing.
The problems of your future are my privilege.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> She... She destroyed it.<eos> She?<eos> You know her!
She... She destroyed it.<eos> She?<eos> You know her!<eos> You do, don't you?<eos> You know the bitch?
Do it now! '<eos> I'm leaving this place.<eos> If no-one follows me, no-one dies.<eos> 'Lay down your weapon.'<eos> You are a policeman, I'm a professional.
They get retired in a pretty permanent sort of way.<eos> Not on my watch.<eos> 'My darling, I need to tell you this because you mustn't hate me for going away.'<eos> Pardon me, I can hear a squeaking.<eos> - Can you hear a squeaking?
She said relax.<eos> Did you have a nice time in London?<eos> It was OK, I guess.<eos> But did somebody hide the sun?<eos> Did you lose it in the war?
- I think I'm dying.<eos> I don't feel so good.<eos> You're all right.<eos> Oh, you're sweet.<eos> You have a very kind face.
You're all right.<eos> Oh, you're sweet.<eos> You have a very kind face.<eos> God will smile on you.<eos> 'But I don't want you and Sherlock hanging off my gun arm,
You have a very kind face.<eos> God will smile on you.<eos> 'But I don't want you and Sherlock hanging off my gun arm,<eos> I'm sorry, my love.'<eos> I know you'll try to find me but there is no point.
Every move is random and not even Sherlock Holmes can anticipate the roll of a dice.<eos> I need to move the target far, far away from you and Rosie, and then I'll come back, my darling.<eos> I swear I will.'<eos> Not like this one.<eos> You haven't got a chance, not a chance.
You haven't got a chance, not a chance.<eos> I've got you where I want you.<eos> Give in, give in!<eos> I will destroy you.<eos> You're completely at my mercy.
- Ajay?<eos> - Oh, you remember me, I'm touched.<eos> Look, I thought you were dead, believe me, I did.<eos> I've been looking forward to this for longer than you can imagine.<eos> I swear to you, I thought you were dead.
- Thank you.<eos> - Look... Look...<eos> I don't normally do this,<eos> - but, um...<eos> - But you're going to.
Six years ago you held the brief for Foreign Operations, code name Love.<eos> And you're basing all this on a code name?<eos> On a whispered voice on the telephone?<eos> Come on, Mycroft.<eos> You were the conduit for AGRA.
- And they were betrayed.<eos> Not by me.<eos> Mycroft, we have known each other a long time.<eos> I promise you, I haven't the foggiest idea what all this is about.<eos> You wound up AGRA and all the other freelancers.
Yeah. I just make a series of gurgling noises at the moment.<eos> Although she does seem to enjoy them.<eos> Well, I'll have to give that a go.<eos> Got a lot to catch up on.<eos> 'You think you understand.
Although she does seem to enjoy them.<eos> Well, I'll have to give that a go.<eos> Got a lot to catch up on.<eos> 'You think you understand.<eos> You understand nothing.'
This was always my favourite spot for agents to meet.<eos> We're like them.<eos> Ghostly, living in the shadows.<eos> Predatory?<eos> Well, it depends which side you're on.
I just come here to look at the fish.<eos> I knew this would happen one day.<eos> - It's like that old story.<eos> - I really am a very busy man.<eos> Would you mind cutting to the chase?
I knew this would happen one day.<eos> - It's like that old story.<eos> - I really am a very busy man.<eos> Would you mind cutting to the chase?<eos> You're very sure of yourself, aren't you?
- Hello, Mary. - Hey.<eos> - John?<eos> - On his way.<eos> Let me introduce Ammo.<eos> You were Ammo?
- John?<eos> - On his way.<eos> Let me introduce Ammo.<eos> You were Ammo?<eos> You were the person on the phone that time?
The ambassador in Tbilisi found out. I thought I'd had it.<eos> Then she was taken hostage in that coup.<eos> I couldn't believe my luck!<eos> That bought me a little time.<eos> But then you found out your boss had sent AGRA in.
What you didn't know, Mary, was that this one also tipped off the hostage-takers.<eos> Lady Smallwood gave the order.<eos> But I sent another one to the terrorists, with a nice little clue about her code name, should anyone have an enquiring mind.<eos> Seemed to do the trick.<eos> And you thought your troubles were over.
Well, you handled the operation in Tbilisi very well.<eos> Thanks.<eos> - For a secretary.<eos> - What?<eos> It can't have been easy all those years, sitting in the back, keeping your mouth shut when you knew you were cleverer than most of the people in the room.
Yes, your little flat.<eos> - Well, on your salary, it would have to be modest, and you spent all the money on that cottage, didn't you?<eos> And what are you, widowed or divorced?<eos> Wedding ring is at least 30 years old and you've moved it to another finger.<eos> That means you're sentimentally attached to it, but you're not still married.

- Two Burmese and a Tortoiseshell, judging by the cat hairs on your cardigan.<eos> A divorcee is more likely to look for a new partner, a widow to fill the void left by her dead husband.<eos> - Sherlock, don't.<eos> - Pets do that, or so I'm told.<eos> There's clearly no-one new in your life, or you wouldn't be spending your Friday nights in an aquarium.
- Pets do that, or so I'm told.<eos> There's clearly no-one new in your life, or you wouldn't be spending your Friday nights in an aquarium.<eos> That accounts for the drink problem too, the slight tremor in your hand, the red wine stain ghosting your top lip.<eos> So, yes, I'd say jealousy was your motive after all.<eos> To prove how good you are.
Vivian Norbury, who out-smarted them all.<eos> All except Sherlock Holmes.<eos> There's no way out.<eos> So it would seem.<eos> You've seen right through me, Mr Holmes.
All right, Mary?<eos> Mary? Stay with me, stay with me.<eos> - Oh, come on...<eos> - No, don't worry.<eos> Come on, Doctor, you can do better than that.
Mary...<eos> Don't you dare!<eos> You made a vow.<eos> You swore it.<eos> 'You've been having dreams.
This is a two-way relationship, you know.<eos> The whole world has come crashing down around you.<eos> Everything's hopeless.<eos> Irretrievable.<eos> I know that's what you must feel but I can only help you if you completely open yourself up to me.
Look after little Rosie.<eos> I'm just going to, um look through these things.<eos> Oh, you're not up to it, are you?<eos> Work is the best antidote to sorrow, Mrs Hudson.<eos> Yes. Yes, I expect you're right.
Yes. Yes, I expect you're right.<eos> I'll make some tea, shall I?<eos> - Mrs Hudson?<eos> - Yes, Sherlock?<eos> If you ever think I'm becoming a bit full of myself, cocky or over-confident...
When I'm... gone, if I'm gone I need you to do something for me.'<eos> I just wondered how things were going and if there was anything I could do.<eos> It's, er, it's from John.<eos> - Right.<eos> - You don't need to read it now.
It's, er, it's from John.<eos> - Right.<eos> - You don't need to read it now.<eos> I'm sorry, Sherlock.<eos> He says... John said if you were to come round asking after him, offering to help...
The submarine dropped them off.<eos> Persian Gulf Strait of Hormuz<eos> - Iranian Coast<eos> They are there.<eos> Commit yourself, you will discover the world.

And they had to steal what we were supposed to destroy.<eos> Not only do they possess the substance, But we pass, and by extension Washington, For war criminals.<eos> I had never felt such an outburst... Of my entire career.<eos> I am prepared to accept any sanction, madam.<eos> Happy to hear you say it.
Whatever the owners, their logistics worry me.<eos> Yes Madam.<eos> - They were very organized.<eos> "It's up to us to be!"<eos> I wanted to make sure you had a clear mind.
- Very dangerous.<eos> - Thrilling.<eos> "Marty was your commanding officer?"<eos> - Yes sir.<eos> - You were close?
I was a blue, and he often saved me.<eos> We were almost always together.<eos> - A good guy.<eos> - Very good !<eos> According to your case, You declined 3 assignments and a promotion. Why ?
- microphone...<eos> - Where is he ?<eos> It has a workshop on the banks of the Tiber.<eos> I do not know any more, I swear.<eos> If you told your son that Daddy is okay?
To blow a blow to his ex-boss?<eos> Unless...<eos> Am I still in love with her?<eos> That I work with him.<eos> You are my best agent.
Unless...<eos> Am I still in love with her?<eos> That I work with him.<eos> You are my best agent.<eos> You'll find out.
"I can destroy you."<eos> This picture could be Moscow.<eos> I will share this info.<eos> And ask for help.<eos> Cummings, you will coordinate the From the Downing Street and Washington agreement.
Cummings, you will coordinate the From the Downing Street and Washington agreement.<eos> Yes Madam.<eos> Let's hope Barovski is not too far!<eos> R Cummings Director of Operations<eos> You're quite shocked, Agent Cummings.

Your Baron Orlov is dead, and now you are my mole.<eos> My traitor MI6.<eos> If you doubt the danger to you, I have a copy of this file Ready to be sent to your boss,<eos> Gisela Summer.<eos> You must return the device That your colleagues stole from me in Rome.
Gisela Summer.<eos> You must return the device That your colleagues stole from me in Rome.<eos> It contains a secret that they must not discover.<eos> The more it stays in your services, The more it increases the risks of my mission.<eos> I shall have my revenge, And you have a chance to survive, If you execute my orders.
Dauphin 1 and 3.<eos> Priority: secure the three drones.<eos> Be careful not to let X-rays escape.<eos> Any damage to the crates would cause the gas to spread.<eos> If this happens, you will have to destroy them.
So do not do it.<eos> You do not have to.<eos> Yes, exactly !<eos> You see there?<eos> What are you looking for.
- If they're worth any money...<eos> - No, he found them.<eos> Now chill out.<eos> - Chill out?<eos> - Guys, guys, do you hear that?
We're going back today.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Come on up.<eos> Oh, she's down here.<eos> So you're sure it's a woman?
So you're sure it's a woman?<eos> Not a great-looking woman.<eos> Come see for yourself.<eos> Oh, that smell is... it's intense.<eos> You should make a note of that.
Uh, you're Zack, right?<eos> Yup.<eos> You still go to Angel Grove? Ha!<eos> Sometimes!<eos> You know, the other girl was here too, about an hour ago.
- What do we do?<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> Hey, guys, you gotta come down here!<eos> It's water!<eos> You gotta see this!
- Hi.<eos> - Again?<eos> Well, that is unusual.<eos> This just gets better and better.<eos> Do you feel that?
Monday?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Then 65 million years.<eos> I've been very lonely.<eos> You're all so young-looking.
Yes, yes, the coins!<eos> Different colors.<eos> Different kids.<eos> Different-colored kids!<eos> I'm so excited you're here!
Um, what are you?<eos> I'm Alpha 5, an Alphormic Lorcaid persona android.<eos> - What? Yeah, I know. - He said he's a Alpha 5...<eos> I'm a talking robot.<eos> You can trust me.
You can trust me.<eos> Billy!<eos> What the hell?<eos> Okay.<eos> Why do you keep looking at each other?
Don't think so.<eos> Look!<eos> It's Zordon!<eos> What?<eos> Zordon, they don't know who you are.
Hello. Hate to interrupt.<eos> Did I just hear you say we're Power Rangers?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> You are the Power Rangers.
And every planet in the universe that has life has a piece of the crystal buried inside it.<eos> Sixty-five million years ago, Zordon's team died defending the crystal here in what is now Angel Grove.<eos> - The coins have chosen you five.<eos> - Yes! I knew it!<eos> Now you must protect the Zeo Crystal and life on earth.
- Her name is Rita Repulsa.<eos> She will create Golder, a huge monster who will rip the crystal from the earth, and all life on your planet will die.<eos> With the crystal, Rita will have the power to create and destroy worlds.<eos> So, let me guess.<eos> You want us to kill this woman?
Days, 11 days.<eos> If we're the Power Rangers and this is our ship, if I walk through that door right now, will it open for me'?<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Whoa, what you doing?
No, no, no, come back! No.<eos> No, please, don't leave.<eos> Jason, my ranger team died defending the crystal from Rita.<eos> That's why I'm in this wall.<eos> How'd you know my name?
- And I only speak for myself when I...<eos> - No!<eos> You speak for all of them. You know that, deep down, what I'm saying is true.<eos> You were born for this.<eos> You all waited.
- And...<eos> - Wait, wait, wait! Can I ask a question?<eos> Are we really superheroes?<eos> Like are we more like Iron Man or Spider-Man?<eos> 'Cause I feel like I been bit by a spider, but I feel really good, you know, not as...
I don't know.<eos> But I know that the answer to what's wrong with us and to what's happening to us... is here.<eos> So what are you saying?<eos> I think we gotta come back.<eos> I can't make you come back here.
You need to follow the three rules to being a Power Ranger.<eos> You must never use your powers for personal gain.<eos> You must never escalate a fight, unless your enemy forces you to.<eos> And you must never reveal your identity.<eos> Ever. To assume your ranger identities, you need to morph.
Yes. But only in the shower.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> Let's step into the footprints, please.<eos> Let's try this.<eos> Standing in this circle as a team, you can easily connect to the morphing grid.
Okay, okay.<eos> Let's step into the footprints, please.<eos> Let's try this.<eos> Standing in this circle as a team, you can easily connect to the morphing grid.<eos> - Do you feel it?
Standing in this circle as a team, you can easily connect to the morphing grid.<eos> - Do you feel it?<eos> - Yeah, they do.<eos> No. Not feeling it.<eos> You need to morph to get your armor.
Jason!<eos> We get armor! Oh, we get armor.<eos> Cool.<eos> When do you give us the armor?<eos> You already have it inside of you.
You already have it inside of you.<eos> You bring it out by connecting to each other and connecting to the morphing grid.<eos> Clear your minds and focus.<eos> Power Rangers were a legion of warriors sworn to protect life.<eos> Yes! You must become those warriors.
- What exercise?<eos> - Chill out, dude.<eos> These creatures before you are a simulation of Rita's army.<eos> They're called Putties.<eos> You must get through them to get to her.
Like a video game.<eos> Look.<eos> Whoa! That's a strong-ass hologram.<eos> Not a video game.<eos> This is why you must morph into your armor.
Fear has the town on edge.<eos> This series of murders has police baffled as police have linked the loss of gold to each crime scene.<eos> What is now being dubbed "Angel Grove's Gold Killer" is still on the loose.<eos> Rita manages to create Golder...<eos> Are you listening to me?
And he rips the crystal from the ground, it'll be like 10,000 nuclear bombs washing over Earth.<eos> Supposed to freak us out?<eos> You keep making this harder.<eos> We're busting our asses. Feel free to throw us a bone at some point.<eos> Yes, I see you busting your "asses."
They take on the form of the most powerful organism on the planet.<eos> When these Zords formed, dinosaurs reigned supreme.<eos> They will be an extension of you.<eos> And their power... is all but limitless.<eos> But you're not ready for this power.
When these Zords formed, dinosaurs reigned supreme.<eos> They will be an extension of you.<eos> And their power... is all but limitless.<eos> But you're not ready for this power.<eos> When you morph, your armor will make you one with the Zords.
And their power... is all but limitless.<eos> But you're not ready for this power.<eos> When you morph, your armor will make you one with the Zords.<eos> So come on, let's go train.<eos> Today's the day you become rangers!
You could've killed yourself.<eos> Or us. - Back off, bossman. - Hey!<eos> Oh, come on, guys.<eos> Wow. - Guys, guys, guys, come on! - Watch it!<eos> What are you doing?
Get out.<eos> Training is over for today.<eos> Go home. I'm sorry, he just morphed.<eos> He did it.<eos> You saw it, right?
- Do it again! - I'm trying, I'm trying! I can't focus!<eos> Billy, how'd you do it? Show us.<eos> Okay, we don't know how.<eos> That's what I thought.<eos> If you can't morph, you are not rangers. Go home.
All right.<eos> Cool. Jason's team is failing.<eos> I shall destroy Rita myself.<eos> There must be a way to free me from this wall.<eos> Yes, but the irony is, is that you need these rangers to morph.
Cool. Jason's team is failing.<eos> I shall destroy Rita myself.<eos> There must be a way to free me from this wall.<eos> Yes, but the irony is, is that you need these rangers to morph.<eos> If they morph, you can harness that energy to regenerate your body and come back through.
Yes, but the irony is, is that you need these rangers to morph.<eos> If they morph, you can harness that energy to regenerate your body and come back through.<eos> There's got to be another way!<eos> I can't... What, Zordon?<eos> You can't what?
If they morph, you can harness that energy to regenerate your body and come back through.<eos> There's got to be another way!<eos> I can't... What, Zordon?<eos> You can't what?<eos> Wait for us dumb kids to morph so that you can come back to life?
You coming back?<eos> This has only ever been about protecting the crystal.<eos> Rita could be building Goldar as we speak.<eos> - Don't underestimate me or my team.<eos> - You can't stop him.
- Don't underestimate me or my team.<eos> - You can't stop him.<eos> She will have him dig up the crystal and life on earth will die.<eos> And we need you.<eos> Because you were so successful at stopping her last time.
I don't need to stand here and have you tell me what I did wrong.<eos> - I can go home and get that.<eos> - Jason, you need me out of this wall. To help lead this team!<eos> Your team's dead.<eos> And you're just as scared as we are.
Hold this.<eos> - No, no, no. Let's just think about this, okay?<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> Right on time.<eos> I was beginning to think you were too dumb to know where the dead ships live.
- What?<eos> - Billy!<eos> - Billy!<eos> - Jason, we gotta help him!<eos> You're not ready to kill me.
- Let's just put him down. - Okay.<eos> - Slow, slow, slow.<eos> - Master Billy.<eos> Do something, okay?<eos> There must be something you can do for him.
- Slow, slow, slow.<eos> - Master Billy.<eos> Do something, okay?<eos> There must be something you can do for him.<eos> I told you that you were not ready.
Turn your head.<eos> Trust me.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thanks, Kim.<eos> That's what you get.
We've got swords.<eos> Wait!<eos> Guys...<eos> Look at me.<eos> You think you've won?
Look at me.<eos> You think you've won?<eos> I came for the crystal.<eos> Others will come!<eos> What you have... it can't last.
You think you've won?<eos> I came for the crystal.<eos> Others will come!<eos> What you have... it can't last.<eos> You know I'm right!
Jason Scott is here and Kimberly Hart and Zack Taylor and some girl named Didi.<eos> Mom, it's Trini! I'm coming!<eos> I'm coming!<eos> This ranger team did what my team could not.<eos> You will humbly walk amongst your peers, but heroes you all will be.
Well it was simple.<eos> And the stories were simple.<eos> There's that mischievous age of the warmhearted.<eos> And the adventures of inqua, the far traveler.<eos> You heard about inqua?
My name is Riley.<eos> My name is Nance.<eos> Do you have any food? Of course.<eos> We have plenty of food.<eos> How long have you been here?
Alright. Let's get some food.<eos> Here, come sit here.<eos> We thought we were alone.<eos> So... There is no one else.<eos> You found no one.
There was nothing you could do?<eos> How is that fair?<eos> The world is the world.<eos> You cannot fault it for not behaving as you believe it should.<eos> So you don't believe that we've been led here to find each other?
And in the end the question of our context is inconsequential.<eos> If there is a design we are foregone to fit within it.<eos> And if there is no design, we are alone in our keep and no ground will hold us.<eos> It's time to wake up.<eos> Do you want me to make you guys some tea?
- Of course, Mr. Randa.<eos> I left you a message this morning about rescheduling today's appointment.<eos> But he should have something available in the coming weeks.<eos> - Al, you're looking well.<eos> So you didn't get the message, Randa? To reschedule?
So you didn't get the message, Randa? To reschedule?<eos> For the fifth time?<eos> I must've missed it.<eos> It'll be quick.<eos> Okay, don't get comfortable. You got five minutes. I'm late for a meeting.
Rain, heat, mud, disease carrying flies and mosquitos.<eos> Sure, you could load up on the atabrine for the malaria but what about the other bacteria?<eos> And we haven't even started on the things that want to eat you alive.<eos> - We'll double that.<eos> - You have no idea how dangerous this is.
Pay him.<eos> I mean, I think Mr. Conrad should be fairly compensated.<eos> Here's to profit during peacetime.<eos> One question.<eos> You came here looking for a tracker.
- We're just scholars and scientists.<eos> We need someone with experience.<eos> In case things go sideways.<eos> Men go to war in search of something, Mr. Conrad.<eos> If you'd found it you'd be home by now.
- Embedded with MACV-SOG.<eos> - You were in the shit.<eos> I respect that.<eos> But it's people like you lost us support back home.<eos> You're not actually gonna blame the people without guns for losing the war, are you?
We'll use explosives to shake the earth and create vibrations helping us to map the subsurface of the island.<eos> We'll fly in over the south shore, and then strategically drop seismic charges to better help us understand the density of the earth.<eos> You're dropping bombs?<eos> - Scientific instruments.<eos> - You hear that, boys?
So, tip for everybody don't miss it, please.<eos> - What are you doing down here?<eos> - I could ask you the same thing.<eos> Why does a geological mapping mission need explosives?<eos> You weren't listening in class.
- I could ask you the same thing.<eos> Why does a geological mapping mission need explosives?<eos> You weren't listening in class.<eos> Seismic charges for the geological survey.<eos> - You believe that?
Okay, Captain Conrad. What about you?<eos> How did British special forces get dragged into this?<eos> Just "Conrad." I'm decommissioned.<eos> - They offered me money.<eos> - You don't strike me as a mercenary.
How did British special forces get dragged into this?<eos> Just "Conrad." I'm decommissioned.<eos> - They offered me money.<eos> - You don't strike me as a mercenary.<eos> You don't strike me as a war photographer.
I'm sure the Landsat inspector will be inspired by your courage.<eos> No, he'll be inspired by my common sense.<eos> This is only a map survey.<eos> To one of the last uncharted areas on the face of the Earth.<eos> And you wanna call it on account of rain? Stay on the boat if you want to.
You are cleared for takeoff.<eos> Launch, launch, launch.<eos> Combat formation.<eos> Keep visual.<eos> Fox Five, let me know when you close.
Copy all, Fox Three.<eos> Heading 0-9-0.<eos> Are you seeing what I'm seeing?<eos> The seismic response is incredible.<eos> Hey, Randa, you're not gonna believe this.
We should head north and join anyone we find.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> I don't know how to answer that question right now.<eos> I don't know what that was either.<eos> All that money that they paid you? I hope you're worth it.
Chapman, hold your position. We'll come to you.<eos> There's enough munitions on that Sea Stallion to kill this thing.<eos> Survey your perimeter. Locate possible ambush sites. Over.<eos> Chapman.<eos> Reles, taking an R and R day, or you good to go?
- How you doing? - I'm fine.<eos> Thank you. Good.<eos> Glad to hear it.<eos> I was worried about you.<eos> You are going to tell me everything I don't know or I'm gonna blow your head off.
- But today...<eos> - So this was never about geology.<eos> You dropped those charges to flush something out.<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - You heard of the USS Lawton?
This planet doesn't belong to us.<eos> Ancient species owned this earth long before mankind.<eos> And if we keep our heads buried in the sand, they will take it back.<eos> My agency is known as Monarch. We specialize in the hunt for Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organisms.<eos> You knew that thing was out here?
No, no, no. No need for that.<eos> Come on now.<eos> Everybody, keep your wigs on now!<eos> What?<eos> I didn't believe it when they said you were coming.
Did you crash here?<eos> Sorry, miss.<eos> Lieutenant Hank Marlow of the 45th.<eos> Put the old flight suit on for you.<eos> You are more beautiful than a hotdog and a beer at Wrigley Field on opening day.
Sorry, miss.<eos> Lieutenant Hank Marlow of the 45th.<eos> Put the old flight suit on for you.<eos> You are more beautiful than a hotdog and a beer at Wrigley Field on opening day.<eos> But you're real.
There's something out there, man.<eos> Oh, there's a lot out there.<eos> Now, come on. We gotta get home.<eos> You don't wanna be out here at night.<eos> You probably noticed a lot of weird things on this island.
There's no crime, no personal property.<eos> They're past all that.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So, good news.<eos> They say you can shack up here.
Nieves, now is not the time.<eos> All right?<eos> What lands here tends to stay here.<eos> As far as I can tell, this ship washed up about 10 years before I did.<eos> - You've been here since '44? - Yeah.
Hey, what happened with the war? Did we win?<eos> Which one?<eos> That makes sense.<eos> This is all hallowed ground to them.<eos> So if you like your hands, don't touch anything.
Why?<eos> 'Cause it sounds neat.<eos> - Look, I just made that name up. - I'm trying to scare you.<eos> - I'm fine calling them that.<eos> - Are you cool with that?
- Are you cool with that?<eos> I like the name...<eos> - Yeah, that seems like a great name.<eos> I've never said that name out loud before. It sounds stupid now that I say it. Just...<eos> You call them whatever you want.
They're big lizard things. Nasty.<eos> They come from the vents deep down.<eos> That's why Kong got so mad.<eos> Those bombs woke up a bunch of them.<eos> I tell you what. You're lucky he's out there, too, or you wouldn't have made it this far.
That was something.<eos> You gotta be kidding me.<eos> That thing looks like it's made out of pure tetanus.<eos> I know she ain't pretty to look at, but it's nothing a couple of extra hands can't fix.<eos> Unless you got a better idea, I suggest we get cracking.
It bleeds.<eos> - We did that.<eos> We hook up with Chapman, there's enough munitions on that downed Sea Stallion to finish the job.<eos> Magnificent.<eos> You know why I carry this instead of an M-16?
The one guy in the crowd who actually took me seriously.<eos> It felt good.<eos> Then I thought he was crazy when he said the earth was full of monsters.<eos> I can't tell when I'm talking or when I'm not talking.<eos> - You're talking. - Am I?
I'm going on perimeter.<eos> Colonel Packard this mission to the crash site is folly.<eos> I understand going after your man.<eos> But the rest of it this is beyond us.<eos> You don't like the way I'm running things?
Colonel Packard this mission to the crash site is folly.<eos> I understand going after your man.<eos> But the rest of it this is beyond us.<eos> You don't like the way I'm running things?<eos> You know where the door is.
I understand going after your man.<eos> But the rest of it this is beyond us.<eos> You don't like the way I'm running things?<eos> You know where the door is.<eos> You set this in motion when you put this place on the map.
Come on, come on, come on.<eos> Yes.<eos> I guess this is goodbye.<eos> Thank you.<eos> If you're ever in Chicago, look me up, I guess.
We got hitched right before I deployed.<eos> Got a telegram from her the day before I got shot down. She said we just had our baby boy.<eos> I got a son out there.<eos> Grown man I've never met.<eos> Yeah, she definitely thinks you're dead, man.
They should be here soon.<eos> Unless they were eaten by something that's bigger than us.<eos> - Holy shit!<eos> - Slivko!<eos> - I thought you were crazy.
- Good to see you, fellas!<eos> - Who the hell is this?<eos> - We picked up a hitchhiker.<eos> Lieutenant Hank Marlow of the 45th Pursuit Squadron of the 15th.<eos> - You've been here since World War II?
You're a good group of boys to die with, I'll tell you that much.<eos> You shouldn't have come here.<eos> Don't forget to tell me this is a bad idea.<eos> This is a bad idea.<eos> Yeah, you smell that?
The crash site's just on the other side of this valley.<eos> We'll cross through and make it to the highest point west.<eos> This place is a real no-no, sir.<eos> We need to be going to the north side right now.<eos> And you're welcome to do that, my man.
Marlow!<eos> Sword!<eos> Slivko, hang on!<eos> This thing's moving!<eos> Now, look, Colonel. You may outrank me but I've been here a hell of a lot longer.
- Please!<eos> You need to listen to us! - We're not at war.<eos> You're making a mistake.<eos> - Your lies got my men killed!<eos> - And you're gonna get us all killed!
Now, I'm gonna take these civilians back to the boat, and we'll wait for you there.<eos> All right?<eos> Saddle up!<eos> Let's go kill this thing!<eos> Steve, you running with the big dogs or staying on the porch?
- Ants.<eos> Big ones.<eos> There's one.<eos> Sounds like a bird, but it's a fucking ant.<eos> Gather up everything you can, including those seismic charges.
The boat must be around that bend.<eos> We have to go.<eos> Don't shoot!<eos> - Conrad, which way are we going?<eos> - You three need to go back to the boat.
It's that way.<eos> Wait for us till dawn.<eos> If we're not back by then... - ...just go.<eos> - You ain't gotta twist my arm.<eos> Where are you two going?
- This thing brought us down! - It killed my men!<eos> - Kong was just defending his territory. We are soldiers!<eos> We do the dirty work so our families and our countrymen don't have to be afraid!<eos> They shouldn't even know a thing like this exists!<eos> You've lost your mind.
Don't know where<eos> Don't know when<eos> But I know we'll meet again<eos> ...here we go now to the Cub half of number eight.<eos> If you want to see a crowd go crazy, see what happens if this guy hits one right now.
...here we go now to the Cub half of number eight.<eos> If you want to see a crowd go crazy, see what happens if this guy hits one right now.<eos> Fly ball, very deep.<eos> And the impossible dream just became the possible dream!<eos> You just gonna sit there?
Is this fun for you?<eos> - I promise I won't tell the Russians.<eos> - I promise I will tell the Russians.<eos> She's gonna tell the Russians.<eos> - Why are you keeping us here?
Are you okay?<eos> Lady?<eos> Was I sleeping?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - I mean, I thought maybe you were dead. - Heh.
- I can see it.<eos> - Oh, my God, I could cry.<eos> I was so scared about coming here.<eos> Oh, everyone is the first time.<eos> But you're here.
What's your relationship like with your family?<eos> It's- - It's good.<eos> Yeah, it's, you know...<eos> I would prefer not to talk about personal things because I have a hard time with that.<eos> You don't get along with your family?
Maxwell?<eos> A few days, but he doesn't want to talk to you.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - I'll try and get him to call you later.<eos> - Can you please...
I'm Frank.<eos> You're Frank Harper?<eos> Yeah, this is my store.<eos> Just opened last week.<eos> You wanna come in?
Just opened last week.<eos> You wanna come in?<eos> Thief.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> You heard me.
You know, like TV melodramas?<eos> Maybe you're attracted to a dramatic environment.<eos> Have you ever thought that or like, you know dramatic state of mind?<eos> Are you familiar with the laws of attraction?<eos> Are you even a real doctor?
Tania?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Last night, I felt this like, warm, bright light.<eos> And...<eos> It felt so real, and it just made me feel, like everything is gonna be okay, you know?
Okay, fine.<eos> If you just back up and turn around, we'll take the other road.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hey.<eos> You're- - You're home.
Hi.<eos> Hey.<eos> You're- - You're home.<eos> Oh, thank God.<eos> You having a Pam'?
No, it's okay.<eos> It's just a small gash.<eos> - Okay. - Okay.<eos> I'm just gonna--<eos> You need to just--
It's just a small gash.<eos> - Okay. - Okay.<eos> I'm just gonna--<eos> You need to just--<eos> No, no, you need to stay conscious, okay?
You need to just--<eos> No, no, you need to stay conscious, okay?<eos> - Okay. - So just-<eos> - Just--<eos> Can you tell me your name?
Yeah, give me a hand.<eos> I wanna stand.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Stay down.<eos> Okay. Okay, you're right.
Really, I don't know them very well.<eos> God, I feel so dizzy.<eos> Wait.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> What are you doing? What?
I woke up.<eos> How did you sleep?<eos> I didn't.<eos> I don't.<eos> You just said you woke up.
Why does everything have to be understandable?<eos> Why can't some things be unacceptable? And we can just say that.<eos> I only mean it's okay.<eos> I'm letting my daughter down. How the hell is that okay?<eos> You just lost your wife.
I only mean it's okay.<eos> I'm letting my daughter down. How the hell is that okay?<eos> You just lost your wife.<eos> And Rosie just lost her mother.<eos> You are holding yourself to an unreasonable standard.
John, look at me.<eos> I'm not here.<eos> You know that, don't you?<eos> Okay. I'll see you later.<eos> Is there anything you're not telling me?
You know that, don't you?<eos> Okay. I'll see you later.<eos> Is there anything you're not telling me?<eos> No.<eos> What are you looking at?
Is there anything you're not telling me?<eos> No.<eos> What are you looking at?<eos> Nothing.<eos> You keep glancing to my left.
Has he attempted to make contact with you?<eos> No!<eos> How can you be sure?<eos> He might have tried.<eos> No, if Sherlock Holmes wants to get in touch, that's not something you can fail to notice.
No!<eos> How can you be sure?<eos> He might have tried.<eos> No, if Sherlock Holmes wants to get in touch, that's not something you can fail to notice.<eos> Well, now. Won't you introduce me?
What's the very worst thing you can do... to your very best friends?<eos> Something on your mind?<eos> Yes, Simon.<eos> Yes.<eos> Whatever you tell us, stays in this room.
Interferes with...<eos> - The memory.<eos> - The memory.<eos> I want to thank you, Ivan, for allowing me to use it.<eos> Didn't exactly know who you were gonna be using it on.
- The memory.<eos> - The memory.<eos> I want to thank you, Ivan, for allowing me to use it.<eos> Didn't exactly know who you were gonna be using it on.<eos> - You mean you didn't ask.
I'm afraid that some of the memories you've had up to this point might also be... corrupted.<eos> I'm going to share something with you now.<eos> Something personal. And of importance to me.<eos> I have a need to confess.<eos> But you, I think, might have a need to forget.
I'm going to share something with you now.<eos> Something personal. And of importance to me.<eos> I have a need to confess.<eos> But you, I think, might have a need to forget.<eos> By the end of this, you'll be free to go, and don't worry, by the time you're back in the outside world you will not remember any of what you've heard.
- What name?<eos> I can't remember.<eos> I can't remember who my father wanted to kill.<eos> And I don't know if he ever did it.<eos> You've changed, you need to top up your tan and your roots are showing, you're letting yourself go.
I can't remember.<eos> I can't remember who my father wanted to kill.<eos> And I don't know if he ever did it.<eos> You've changed, you need to top up your tan and your roots are showing, you're letting yourself go.<eos> Do you ever look in the mirror and want to see someone else?
Why do you ask?<eos> Not sure actually.<eos> Probably just noticed something.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Of course, you don't own a car. You don't need one. Do you?
Probably just noticed something.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Of course, you don't own a car. You don't need one. Do you?<eos> Living in isolation. No human contact. No visitors.<eos> Okay, how do you know that?
Why was I doing that? I don't know.<eos> -Me neither.<eos> Must've had a reason.<eos> It'll come back to me.<eos> Presumably, you downsized when you left your job. And maybe when you ended your relationship.
-Me neither.<eos> Must've had a reason.<eos> It'll come back to me.<eos> Presumably, you downsized when you left your job. And maybe when you ended your relationship.<eos> - You can't know that.
- Of course I can.<eos> There wasn't anything physical going on, was there?<eos> Quite some time, in fact.<eos> There, see, it's obvious.<eos> You can't tell things like that from a piece of paper.
Yes, but I'm very busy at the moment.<eos> I have to drink a cup of tea.<eos> This cup of tea...<eos> - It's a cup of tea.<eos> You're my last hope.
- Your skirt.<eos> - My skirt?<eos> Look at the hem of it! That's what I noticed. Sorry.<eos> I'm still catching up with my brain. It's terribly fast.<eos> Those markings, do you see them?
- My skirt?<eos> Look at the hem of it! That's what I noticed. Sorry.<eos> I'm still catching up with my brain. It's terribly fast.<eos> Those markings, do you see them?<eos> You only get marks like that by trapping the hem of your skirt in a car door, but they're on the left hand side, so you weren't driving.
You only get marks like that by trapping the hem of your skirt in a car door, but they're on the left hand side, so you weren't driving.<eos> I came in a taxi.<eos> There is no taxi waiting in the street outside.<eos> That's what I checked when I went to the window.<eos> And you've got all the way to the door and not made any move to phone for one, and look at you.
There is no taxi waiting in the street outside.<eos> That's what I checked when I went to the window.<eos> And you've got all the way to the door and not made any move to phone for one, and look at you.<eos> You didn't even bring a coat, in this rain?<eos> Now, that might mean nothing, except the angle of the scars on your left forearm, you know, under that sleeve you keep pulling down.
- Then you can keep your scars.<eos> I want to see your handbag.<eos> Why?<eos> It's too heavy.<eos> You said I was your last hope, and now you're going out into the night with no plan on how you're getting home.
- Chips?<eos> You're suicidal. You're allowed chips.<eos> Trust me. It's about the only perk.<eos> Sherlock!<eos> Are you going out?
Sherlock!<eos> Are you going out?<eos> I think I remember the way.<eos> It's through there, isn't it.<eos> You're in a state!
It's your brother.<eos> He's left his flat.<eos> Was it on fire?<eos> Even when I'm on the road I still like quality food.<eos> You see the fold in the middle?
He's left his flat.<eos> Was it on fire?<eos> Even when I'm on the road I still like quality food.<eos> You see the fold in the middle?<eos> For the first few months, you kept this hidden. Folded inside a book.
The past few months, it's been on open display on a wall. Conclusion?<eos> Relationship is over.<eos> The paper has been exposed to steam and a variety of cooking smells. So, it must have been on display in the kitchen.<eos> Lots of different spices.<eos> You're suicidal, alone and strapped for cash. Yet, you're still cooking to impress.

The sun's only struck the bottom two-thirds, but the line is straight.<eos> So, that means we know paper is facing the window.<eos> But, because the top section is unaffected, we know the sunlight can only be entering the room at a steep angle.<eos> If the sunlight was able to penetrate the room when the sun was lower in the sky, then the paper would be equally faded. Top to bottom, but no.<eos> It only makes it when the sun is at its zenith. So, I'm betting that you live in a narrow street, on the ground floor.
He's probably still in shock.<eos> Everybody dies.<eos> That's the one thing human beings can be relied upon to do.<eos> How can it still come as a surprise to people?<eos> You sound cross.
How did you know I wasn't getting any?<eos> It's all about the blood.<eos> This one comes from the very first night.<eos> You can see the pen marks over it.<eos> I think you discovered the pains stimulated your memory so you tried it again later.
This one comes from the very first night.<eos> You can see the pen marks over it.<eos> I think you discovered the pains stimulated your memory so you tried it again later.<eos> I'm no expert, but I assume that since your lover failed to notice an increasing number of scars over a period of months, that the relationship was no longer intimate.<eos> How do you know he didn't notice?
It didn't the last time, and I assure you it won't...<eos> With Sherlock.<eos> Sorry, what?<eos> Please phone me if he gets in contact. Thank you.<eos> Do you still speak to Sherrinford?
- Bollocks.<eos> Culverton Smith, all this charity work.<eos> What's in it for you?<eos> We must be careful not to burn our bridges.<eos> Do you know why I'm gonna take your case? Because of the one impossible thing you said.
Actually, just Napoleon would do.<eos> Or Elvis?<eos> Look, I think we can rule both of them out as targets.<eos> Okay, I got it wrong then. It wasn't on one word. It can't have been.<eos> Did you remember quite distinctly that your whole life turned on one word?
Once it's over, it's not you who'll miss it.<eos> You know, death, it's something that happens to everybody else.<eos> Your life is not your own.<eos> Keep your hands off it.<eos> You're not what I expected, you're...
Sorry, I...<eos> Faith?<eos> You said your life turned on one word.<eos> A name can't be one word.<eos> If you were to come round asking after him, that he'd rather have anyone but you.
You said your life turned on one word.<eos> A name can't be one word.<eos> If you were to come round asking after him, that he'd rather have anyone but you.<eos> Anyone.<eos> - You're not what I expected.
- Anyone.<eos> Why not?<eos> Why shouldn't he be?<eos> - What is wrong? - What's the matter with you?<eos> Do you know where you are?
Right, you there!<eos> Stop right where you are!<eos> - John.<eos> - Mrs Hudson.<eos> Do you have any idea what speed you were going at? Of course, not.
What's going on? What's wrong? -Hello?<eos> My name is Mycroft Holmes. I'm speaking from the Cabinet.<eos> - What's happened?<eos> - It's Sherlock.<eos> You've no idea what I've been through.
"Set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide.<eos> Hold hard the breath<eos> "and build up every spirit to his full height.<eos> "On! On, you noblest English whose blood is fet from fathers, from war-proof!"<eos> "And you, good yeoman, whose limbs were made in England, show us."
"And you, good yeoman, whose limbs were made in England, show us."<eos> "Here the mettle of your pasture!"<eos> "I doubt not, for there is none of you here so mean and base"<eos> "that hath not noble luster in your eyes!"<eos> "I see you standing like greyhounds in the slips straining upon the start!"
They're that man on the telly, aren't they?<eos> - What pictures?<eos> - They're everywhere.<eos> These pictures?<eos> You can see them too!
He's publicly accused Mr Smith of being a serial killer.<eos> Christ.<eos> Sherlock on Twitter.<eos> He really has lost it.<eos> Don't you dare make jokes.
Don't you dare make jokes.<eos> Don't you dare! I was terrified.<eos> A cup of tea!<eos> For goodness' sakes! What's the matter with you? Are you having an earthquake?<eos> You need to see him, John. You need to help him!
He needs you!<eos> Somebody else.<eos> Not me. Not now.<eos> Now, you just listen to me for once in your stupid life.<eos> I know Mary's dead and I know your heart is broken. But if Sherlock Holmes dies too, who'll you have then?
Now, you just listen to me for once in your stupid life.<eos> I know Mary's dead and I know your heart is broken. But if Sherlock Holmes dies too, who'll you have then?<eos> Because I'll tell you something, John Watson. You will not have me.<eos> Have you spoken to Mycroft, Molly, anyone?<eos> They don't matter, you do.
Have you spoken to Mycroft, Molly, anyone?<eos> They don't matter, you do.<eos> Would you just see him, please, John?<eos> Or just take a look at him as a doctor.<eos> I know you'd change your mind if you did.
- I'll try if I'm in the area.<eos> Promise me?<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Well?<eos> On you go.
I asked for a cup of tea.<eos> - How did you get him in the boot?<eos> - The boys from the cafe.<eos> They dropped me. Twice!<eos> And you know why they dropped you, dear?
I'm against new people.<eos> Excuse me for a moment.<eos> She's my therapist.<eos> Awesome.<eos> Do you do block bookings?
Whose car is that? - That's my car.<eos> - How can that be your car?<eos> For God's sake!<eos> I'm the widow of a drug dealer. I own property in Central London. And for the last bloody time, John,<eos> I'm so sorry. I answered your phone, you were busy.
I think you'll want to take it.<eos> - Is this Dr John Watson?<eos> Yeah, who's this?<eos> Culverton Smith.<eos> You've probably heard of me.
- No, I don't care how. Okay.<eos> Fully equipped ambulance. Molly can examine me on the way to save time.<eos> Ready to go, Molly?<eos> Just tell me when to cough. -Well...<eos> Hope you remembered my coat.
Ready to go, Molly?<eos> Just tell me when to cough. -Well...<eos> Hope you remembered my coat.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I didn't know that you were gonna be here.
She's more used to dead people.<eos> It's bound to lower your standards.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't know anything any more.<eos> - Mrs Hudson. As ever, you are amazing. No.
It's bound to lower your standards.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't know anything any more.<eos> - Mrs Hudson. As ever, you are amazing. No.<eos> You're going to have to buck up a bit, John. You know that, don't you?
- Mrs Hudson. As ever, you are amazing. No.<eos> You're going to have to buck up a bit, John. You know that, don't you?<eos> The game is on.<eos> I'll do my best.<eos> Anything you need. Anytime. Just ask.
Yeah, he is.<eos> -Yeah, okay, right. He is.<eos> But he's our monster.<eos> I'm a killer.<eos> You know I'm a killer.
I've seen healthier people on the slab.<eos> Yeah, but to be fair, you work with murder victims. They tend to be quite young.<eos> - Not funny.<eos> - A little bit funny.<eos> If you keep taking what you're taking at the rate you're taking it, you've got weeks.
Exactly.<eos> Weeks.<eos> Let's not get ahead of ourselves.<eos> For Christ's sake, Sherlock! It's not a game.<eos> I'm worried about you, Molly. You seem very stressed.
What? Sorry? Beyond what?<eos> Dangerous.<eos> And action!<eos> I'm a killer.<eos> You know I'm a killer.
Thank you.<eos> You should bag that up.<eos> Sell it.<eos> Make money from that on eBay.<eos> You can make more, if you like. Anytime you like.
- Hospital?<eos> - Culverton's doing a visit.<eos> The kids would love to meet you both.<eos> I think he's sort of promised.<eos> If you'd just like to come this way.
You can have this back now.<eos> - Have what back?<eos> - Thanks for the hug.<eos> I sent and deleted a text.<eos> You might get a reply but I doubt it.
We're going to have endless fun, Mr Holmes. Aren't we?<eos> No, not endless.<eos> Need another hit, do you?<eos> It can wait until the hospital.<eos> You involved, much?
- His blog?<eos> - Don't you read it?<eos> - You mean my blog?<eos> Say what you like about addiction, the day is full of highlights.<eos> Mr Holmes, you're feeling better.
- Great...<eos> - It's my blog. It is.<eos> He writes the blog.<eos> - It's yours? - Yes.<eos> - You write Sherlock's blog?
My God.<eos> I love your blog.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Right. Here he comes. The internet tech.<eos> You all know Sherlock Holmes.
Ultimately, for full satisfaction, it requires plain sight.<eos> Additionally, serial killers are easily profiled.<eos> They tend to be social outcasts.<eos> - Educationally sub-normal.<eos> You're just talking about the ones you know. The ones you've caught.

Anyone ever opt to remember?<eos> Some people take the drip out.<eos> Yes, some people have the same urges.<eos> Now, come on. Wasting time.<eos> Indeed you have, I estimate, 20 minutes left. Sorry?
She's fine.<eos> She's dead.<eos> H.H. Holmes loved the dead. He mass-produced them.<eos> Serial killer, active during the Chicago Fair.<eos> You know what he did? He built a hotel, a special hotel, just to kill people.

Well, all that effort.<eos> You don't build a beach if you want to hide a pebble.<eos> You just find a beach and...<eos> If you wanna hide a murder, you wanna hide lots and lots of murders, just find a... hospital.<eos> Can we be clear? Are you confessing?
Can we be clear? Are you confessing?<eos> To what?<eos> The way you're talking.<eos> Sorry.<eos> You mean, am I a serial killer? Or am I just trying to mess with your funny little head?
You mean, am I a serial killer? Or am I just trying to mess with your funny little head?<eos> Well, it's true.<eos> I do like to mess with people, and yes, I am a bit creepy but that's just my USP.<eos> But am I what he says I am?<eos> Is that what you're asking?
Are you?<eos> Are you, are you actually serious?<eos> I've played along with this joke.<eos> It's not funny any more.<eos> You know, look at him.
There are two possible explanations for what's going on here.<eos> Either I'm a serial killer, or Sherlock Holmes is off his tits on drugs.<eos> Delusional paranoia about a public personality.<eos> That's not so special. It's not even new.<eos> I think you need to tell your faithful little friend how you're wasting his time because you're too high to know what's real any more.
I apologise.<eos> I miscalculated.<eos> I forgot to factor in the traffic.<eos> Nineteen and a half minutes.<eos> The footsteps you're about to hear will be very familiar to you, not least because there'll be three impacts rather than two.
Nineteen and a half minutes.<eos> The footsteps you're about to hear will be very familiar to you, not least because there'll be three impacts rather than two.<eos> Your daughter Faith's walking cane.<eos> Why would she be here?<eos> You invited her.

"Faith, I can stand it no longer."<eos> "I've confessed to my crimes."<eos> "Please forgive me."<eos> How would that have any effect?<eos> You don't know her.
But I do.<eos> I spent a whole evening with her.<eos> We had chips.<eos> I think she liked me.<eos> You don't know Faith. You simply do not.

You don't know Faith. You simply do not.<eos> I know you care about her deeply.<eos> I know you invited her to one of your special board meetings.<eos> You care what she thinks.<eos> You maintain an impressive facade.
Never happened.<eos> Is this another one of your drug-fuelled fantasies?<eos> - You didn't you see him take the scalpel?<eos> - Nobody saw it.<eos> - So you didn't know what was about to happen? - Of course I didn't know.
Well, there must've been some build-up. He didn't just suddenly do it.<eos> Look, I didn't know he had the bloody scalpel.<eos> Sorry, I'm not sure I completely understand.<eos> Understand what?<eos> -But I thought you two were, were old friends!
Have we?<eos> Sherlock?<eos> So who came to my flat?<eos> Well, it wasn't me.<eos> You look different.
Sherlock, you all right?<eos> Sherlock, you okay?<eos> - Watch him.<eos> He's got a knife. - Got a what?<eos> Got a scalpel. You picked it up from that table. I saw you take it.
He's got a knife. - Got a what?<eos> Got a scalpel. You picked it up from that table. I saw you take it.<eos> I certainly did not!<eos> Look behind his back!<eos> - I saw you take it! I saw you!
We did see it coming.<eos> We always saw it coming.<eos> But it was fun.<eos> - Come in. - Sir.<eos> You probably wanna see this.
But I can promise you this. He's going to get the best of care.<eos> I might even move him to my favourite room.<eos> Culverton Smith, earlier today.<eos> In Nottingham...<eos> He's right you know, you probably saved his life.
You've got your disapproving face on.<eos> Well, seeing as I'm inside your head, I think we can call that self-loathing.<eos> Where is she? Where is Mrs Hudson?<eos> She'll be up in a moment.<eos> - What are you doing? - Sorry...
Are you using spooks now, to look after your family.<eos> Hang on, are they tidying?<eos> Sherlock is a security concern.<eos> The fact that I'm his brother changes nothing.<eos> - Yeah you said that before.
Shut up, you.<eos> -Mycroft, last time when we were on the phone...<eos> No, no, no, stop.<eos> I detest conversation in the past tense.<eos> You said the fact that you're his brother made no difference.
Who are you talking about? -Atta boy.<eos> Nobody.<eos> I misspoke.<eos> - He's lying.<eos> - You're lying.
Mycroft Holmes.<eos> What are these dreadful people doing in my house?<eos> Mrs Hudson I apologise for the interruption.<eos> As you know, my brother has embarked in a programme of self-destruction, remarkable even by his standards, and I'm endeavouring to find out what triggered it.<eos> - And that's what you're looking for?
What's on his mind?<eos> - So to speak.<eos> - And you've had all this time?<eos> Time being something of which we don't have an infinite supply. So, if we could be about our business.<eos> You're so funny, you are!
- And you've had all this time?<eos> Time being something of which we don't have an infinite supply. So, if we could be about our business.<eos> You're so funny, you are!<eos> Mrs Hudson?<eos> He thinks you're clever.
Mrs Hudson?<eos> He thinks you're clever.<eos> Poor old Sherlock.<eos> Always going on about you.<eos> I mean he knows you're an idiot. But that's okay, 'cause you are a lovely doctor.

Always going on about you.<eos> I mean he knows you're an idiot. But that's okay, 'cause you are a lovely doctor.<eos> But he has no idea what an idiot you are!<eos> Is this merely stream of consciousness abuse, or are you attempting to make a point?<eos> You want to know what's bothering Sherlock? Easiest thing in the world.
All of you!<eos> This is my house, this is my friend, and that's his departed wife.<eos> Anyone who stays here a minute longer is admitting to me personally, they do not have a single spark of human decency.<eos> Get out of my house. You reptile.<eos> You've been ages waking' up.
I watched you.<eos> It was quite lovely in its way.<eos> Take it easy, it's okay.<eos> I don't want to rush this.<eos> You're Sherlock Holmes.
It's up to you.<eos> Save him.<eos> But I do think you're going to need a little help with that, because you're not exactly good with people.<eos> So here's a few things you need to know about the man we both love. And more importantly, what you're going to need to do to save him.<eos> How did you get in?

Come on, can't you guess?<eos> Secret door.<eos> I built this whole wing.<eos> Kept firing the architect who built it, so no one knew quite, how it all fitted together.<eos> I can slip in and out. Whenever I like, you know. When I get the urge.
H.H. Holmes.<eos> Murder castle, but done right.<eos> I have a question for you.<eos> Why you are here?<eos> It's like you walked into my den and laid down in front of me.

My car.<eos> Increase the dosage four, five times, the toxic shock should shut me down, within about an hour.<eos> Then I'll restore the settings.<eos> Everyone assumes that it was a fault, or...<eos> - You just gave up the ghost.

You only get to do this the once.<eos> Scared of dying.<eos> You wanted this though.<eos> I have reasons.<eos> But you don't actually want to die.
I wanted to hear your confession.<eos> Needed to know I was right.<eos> Why do you need to die?<eos> The mortuary, your favourite room.<eos> You talk to the dead.

Has that door locked itself again? Yeah, it's always doing that.<eos> You can't save John, because he won't let you.<eos> He won't allow himself to be saved.<eos> The only way to save John, is to make him save you.<eos> Why do you do it?
That's not what dead people are like.<eos> Dead people look like things.<eos> I like to make people into things.<eos> Then you can own them.<eos> You know what, I'm getting a little impatient.
Go right into hell. And make it look like you mean it.<eos> Murder is a very difficult addiction to manage.<eos> People don't realise how much work goes into it.<eos> You have to be careful.<eos> But if you're rich, or and famous and loved, it's amazing what people are prepared to ignore.
What kind of doctor are you?<eos> I got my confession though, didn't I?<eos> Well, I didn't recall making any confession.<eos> What would I be confessing to?<eos> You can listen to it later.
We'll carry on tomorrow.<eos> Well, we could carry on now, I'm not tired.<eos> There's a loads more.<eos> Tomorrow.<eos> You know, I am gonna be so famous now.
Well, we could carry on now, I'm not tired.<eos> There's a loads more.<eos> Tomorrow.<eos> You know, I am gonna be so famous now.<eos> You're already famous.
What's wrong?<eos> Seriously?<eos> I'm Sherlock Holmes. I wear the damn hat.<eos> Isn't that right, Mary?<eos> You seem so much better, John.
Isn't that right, Mary?<eos> You seem so much better, John.<eos> Yeah, I am.<eos> I think I am.<eos> Not all day, not every day, but, you know.
She was real.<eos> But, I didn't mean Mycroft.<eos> I mean the other one.<eos> Which other one?<eos> You know, the secret one.
I mean the other one.<eos> Which other one?<eos> You know, the secret one.<eos> That was just something... I said. I'm sure there's...<eos> How did you know about that, I didn't tell you that.
-When?<eos> We spent a night together.<eos> It was lovely.<eos> We had chips.<eos> You're not what I expected, Mr Holmes.
We spent a night together.<eos> It was lovely.<eos> We had chips.<eos> You're not what I expected, Mr Holmes.<eos> You're...
In fairness though, he does have excellent taste in chips.<eos> - What's that?<eos> - What's what?<eos> The flower in your hair is like I had on the bus.<eos> You looked very sweet.
- What's that?<eos> - What's what?<eos> The flower in your hair is like I had on the bus.<eos> You looked very sweet.<eos> But then... You have such nice eyes.
- Isn't that how they got started?<eos> Who? Adam and Eve.<eos> Them.<eos> And that turned out okay.<eos> You think so?
Still had 10 minutes to go.<eos> Well, we'll see about a refund.<eos> Right, you two, Wiggins has got your money by the gate, don't spend it all in one crack den.<eos> I hope we didn't spoil your enjoyment of the movie.<eos> You're just leaving?
You're just leaving?<eos> Sleep well!<eos> Dr Watson, why would he do that to me?<eos> - That was insane.<eos> - Yes. Well, someone convinced him that you wouldn't tell the truth unless you were actually wetting yourself.
- Yes. Well, someone convinced him that you wouldn't tell the truth unless you were actually wetting yourself.<eos> "Someone"?<eos> Probably me.<eos> So that's it, is it?<eos> You're just going.
221b Baker Street.<eos> See you in the morning.<eos> If there's a queue, join it.<eos> For God's sake, this is not one of your idiot cases.<eos> You might wanna close that window.
If there's a queue, join it.<eos> For God's sake, this is not one of your idiot cases.<eos> You might wanna close that window.<eos> There is an east wind coming.<eos> You have to sit in the chair.
For God's sake, this is not one of your idiot cases.<eos> You might wanna close that window.<eos> There is an east wind coming.<eos> You have to sit in the chair.<eos> They won't talk to you unless you sit in the chair, it's the rules.
- Have what?<eos> - The deduction thing.<eos> "The deduction thing"?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - More than you can know.
It is a fortress built to keep the rest of the world safe from what is inside it.<eos> Heaven may be a fantasy for the credulous and the afraid. But I can give you a map reference for hell.<eos> That's where our sister has been since early childhood.<eos> She hasn't left, not for a single day.<eos> Whoever you both met, it can't have been her.
- The detective.<eos> The pirate.<eos> Golf, whisky, x-ray, this is a restricted area.<eos> Repeat, restricted area.<eos> You are off course.
Golf, whisky, x-ray, this is a restricted area.<eos> Repeat, restricted area.<eos> You are off course.<eos> Are you receiving?<eos> Golf, whisky, x-ray, you are off course.
It justifies dressing up or any damn thing I say it does.<eos> Now, listen to me.<eos> For your own physical safety, do not speak.<eos> Do not indulge in any non-verbal signal suggestive of internal thought.<eos> If the safety of my sister is compromised, if the security of my sister is compromised, if the incarceration of my sister is compromised, in short, if I find any indication my sister has left this island at any time, I swear to you, you will not!
- Good and bad are fairy tales.<eos> We have evolved to attach an emotional significance to what is nothing more than the survival strategy of the pack animal.<eos> We are conditioned to invest divinity in utility.<eos> Good isn't really good, evil isn't really wrong, and bottoms aren't really pretty.<eos> You are a prisoner of your own meat.

He didn't tell me you'd written me out completely.<eos> What do you mean, "rewritten"?<eos> You still don't know about Redbeard, do you?<eos> This is going to be such a good day.<eos> She smiles at you when you come home.
- And?<eos> Killed himself.<eos> And?<eos> His family.<eos> You're going to cry.
His family.<eos> You're going to cry.<eos> It's okay if you cry.<eos> I don't need to cry.<eos> I can help you cry.
Afraid I didn't notice in the heat of the moment.<eos> And afterwards... Well! You couldn't really tell.<eos> Is that vibrato or is your hand shaking?<eos> I warned you explicitly. No one was to talk to her alone.<eos> - You spoke to her.
Is that vibrato or is your hand shaking?<eos> I warned you explicitly. No one was to talk to her alone.<eos> - You spoke to her.<eos> - I know what I'm doing.<eos> You even brought her a visitor on Christmas Day.
Touch the glass.<eos> I put my trust in you. My implicit trust, as governor of this institute.<eos> It's obvious when it all started.<eos> Well, she was never the same after that Christmas.<eos> It's as if you woke her up.
It's obvious when it all started.<eos> Well, she was never the same after that Christmas.<eos> It's as if you woke her up.<eos> That is entirely beside the point.<eos> You had your orders and failed to act...
I'll touch it too if you're scared.<eos> I can fix her for you and then I'll give you her straight back.<eos> Good as new, I promise.<eos> That's all?<eos> What you're proposing is not...
-Klingons attacking lower decks.<eos> Also, cowboys in black hats. Darth Vader.<eos> Don't be alarmed.<eos> I'm here now, I'm here now.<eos> Did you miss me? Did you miss me?
Big G means governor.<eos> Street speak.<eos> I'm a bit down with the kids, you know.<eos> I'm relatable that way.<eos> Do you like my boys?
Maybe you should sit down.<eos> I wrote my own version of the Nativity when I was a child.<eos> The Hungry Donkey.<eos> It was a bit gory. But if you're gonna put a baby in a manger, you're asking for trouble.<eos> - You know what this place is, of course.
It was a bit gory. But if you're gonna put a baby in a manger, you're asking for trouble.<eos> - You know what this place is, of course.<eos> - Of course.<eos> So, am I under arrest again?<eos> You remain a person of interest, but until you commit a verifiable crime, you are, I regret, at liberty.
- Of course.<eos> So, am I under arrest again?<eos> You remain a person of interest, but until you commit a verifiable crime, you are, I regret, at liberty.<eos> - Then why am I here?<eos> - You are a Christmas present.
Me?<eos> With me?<eos> She has noted your interest in the activities of my little brother.<eos> So... What's she got to do with Sherlock Holmes?<eos> Whatever you're about to tell me, I already know it's gonna be awesome!
- He doesn't sound dead.<eos> This is a recorded announcement.<eos> Please say hello to some very old friends of mine.<eos> Hello?<eos> I can hear you talking.
I'm particularly focused on internal conflicts where strategising round a largely intuitive moral code appears to create a counter-intuitive result.<eos> I will not kill.<eos> I will not have blood on my hands.<eos> Yes, very good, thank you.<eos> Killing my wife is what you're doing.
Please save my wife.<eos> There will, I'm afraid, be regular prompts to create an atmosphere of urgency.<eos> What's your name?<eos> David.<eos> -Are you sure about this, David?
Of course I'm bloody sure.<eos> Nearly there.<eos> Right, do you want to pray or anything?<eos> With Eurus Holmes in the world, who the hell would I pray to?<eos> You are a good man, and you are doing a good thing.
You are a good man, and you are doing a good thing.<eos> So are you.<eos> I'll spend the rest of my life telling myself that.<eos> Please...<eos> I know that you are scared, but you should also be very proud.
You all right?<eos> Interesting.<eos> All right, there you go. You got what you wanted.<eos> - And he's dead.<eos> - Dead or alive, it really wasn't very interesting, but you three, you three, were wonderful.
All right, there you go. You got what you wanted.<eos> - And he's dead.<eos> - Dead or alive, it really wasn't very interesting, but you three, you three, were wonderful.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You see, what you did,
- And he's dead.<eos> - Dead or alive, it really wasn't very interesting, but you three, you three, were wonderful.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You see, what you did,<eos> Dr Watson, specifically, because of your moral code, because you don't want blood on your hands,
Sorry.<eos> Hang on.<eos> What advantage did your moral code grant you?<eos> Is it not, in the end, selfish to keep one's hands clean at the expense of another's life?<eos> You didn't have to kill her!
Hang on.<eos> What advantage did your moral code grant you?<eos> Is it not, in the end, selfish to keep one's hands clean at the expense of another's life?<eos> You didn't have to kill her!<eos> The condition of her survival was that you or Mycroft had to kill her husband.
No cuts, no scarring.<eos> Not Nathan then.<eos> Who's next?<eos> Well done, Dr Watson!<eos> How useful you are.
Is this urgent, because I'm not having a good day.<eos> Molly, I just want you to do something very easy for me and not ask why.<eos> God, is this one of your stupid games?<eos> No, it's not a game.<eos> I need you to help me.
- But I'm not at the lab.<eos> - It's not about that.<eos> Well, quickly then.<eos> What is it?<eos> What do you want?
"I love you."<eos> - Leave me alone.<eos> - Molly, no, please, no, don't hang up. Do not hang up.<eos> Calmly, Sherlock, or I will finish her right now.<eos> Why you doing this to me? Why are you making fun of me?
- Leave me alone.<eos> - Molly, no, please, no, don't hang up. Do not hang up.<eos> Calmly, Sherlock, or I will finish her right now.<eos> Why you doing this to me? Why are you making fun of me?<eos> Please, I swear, you just have to listen to me.
Softer, Sherlock.<eos> Molly, this is for a case.<eos> It's a sort of experiment.<eos> I'm not an experiment, Sherlock.<eos> No, I know you're not an experiment.
I can't say why. But I promise you, it is.<eos> I can't say that. I can't...<eos> I can't say that to you.<eos> Of course you can. Why can't you?<eos> - You know why.
You say it. Go on.<eos> You say it first.<eos> - What?<eos> - Say it.<eos> Say it like you mean it.
Hey, sis, don't mean to complain, but this one's empty.<eos> What happened? Did you run out of ideas?<eos> It's not empty, Sherlock.<eos> You've still got the gun, haven't you?<eos> I told you you'd need it, because only two can play the next game.
- Well...<eos> - Well what?<eos> We're not actually going to discuss this, are we?<eos> I'm sorry, Dr Watson.<eos> You are a fine man in many respects.
Hello?<eos> Hello, are you still there?<eos> Yes. Yeah, no, I'm still here.<eos> I'm here.<eos> You went away.
Hello, are you still there?<eos> Yes. Yeah, no, I'm still here.<eos> I'm here.<eos> You went away.<eos> You said you'd help me and you went away.
Victor Trevor.<eos> We played pirates.<eos> I was Yellowbeard and he was...<eos> He was Redbeard.<eos> You were inseparable.
What do we do now?<eos> I think you better get 'round here.<eos> P.S.<eos> I know you two.<eos> And if I'm gone, I know what you could become.
I think you better get 'round here.<eos> P.S.<eos> I know you two.<eos> And if I'm gone, I know what you could become.<eos> Because I know who you really are.
And if I'm gone, I know what you could become.<eos> Because I know who you really are.<eos> A junkie who solves crimes to get high.<eos> And the doctor who never came home from the war.<eos> Will you listen to me? Who you really are, it doesn't matter.
That's awful!<eos> Bad news, baby!<eos> What are we going to do?<eos> My job is to find out exactly what that new puppy is... so that Baby Corp can stop it.<eos> And you're going to help me.
What are we going to do?<eos> My job is to find out exactly what that new puppy is... so that Baby Corp can stop it.<eos> And you're going to help me.<eos> - Genius!<eos> - Home run! You still got it, boss!
And you're going to help me.<eos> - Genius!<eos> - Home run! You still got it, boss!<eos> Yay. Now, your parents all work for Puppy Co.<eos> So have you learned anything from them?
Let go, you little...<eos> Oh, look! The kids are finally getting along.<eos> That's nice.<eos> Sayonara!<eos> You wanna play?
Can you put your head back on, please?<eos> What is all this?<eos> Surprise!<eos> A Baby Corp binky?<eos> Where did you get that?
You don't recognize me?<eos> Perhaps from my youth!<eos> Super Colossal Big Fat Boss Baby?<eos> He is him?<eos> And him is you?
He is him?<eos> And him is you?<eos> Except older and wrinklier.<eos> That's not right.<eos> No. You were my hero!
And him is you?<eos> Except older and wrinklier.<eos> That's not right.<eos> No. You were my hero!<eos> How did you end up here?
Wait until they meet Puppy Co's certified... in-house childcare expert.<eos> - Don't be nervous, buddy.<eos> - It's only overnight.<eos> We'll be back before you know it.<eos> Besides, you boys are in great hands.
Francis Francis is trying to...<eos> Believe me... Eugenia won't take her eyes off your children.<eos> Not for one second.<eos> That's very reassuring.<eos> Now you see them.
Believe me... Eugenia won't take her eyes off your children.<eos> Not for one second.<eos> That's very reassuring.<eos> Now you see them.<eos> And now, you don't.
You're supposed to end with "Argh!"<eos> Got it!<eos> That's great!<eos> Thanks! I just went with the flow.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, and those in coach... on the left side of the plane... you can see we're approaching fabulous Las Vegas.
Tim! Over there.<eos> Okay, now where's Puppy Co?<eos> Aha!<eos> Here it is. Found it!<eos> But how did you...?
I'm coming!<eos> Atta boy!<eos> Go, Tim!<eos> Launch initiated.<eos> I'm launching my Forever Puppies, and there's nothing you can do about it!
Hey, are you still in there?<eos> What happened?<eos> Did we win? - We won!<eos> Victory nap!<eos> You ruined everything!
Victory nap!<eos> You ruined everything!<eos> It's not fair! It's not fair!<eos> That's not right.<eos> Now you're really going to pay!
Anulax batteries.<eos> Harbulary batteries.<eos> That's nothing like what I just said.<eos> But they're worth thousands of units apiece... which is why the Sovereign hired us to protect them.<eos> Careful what you say around these folks.
Every citizen is born exactly as designed by the community.<eos> Impeccable, both physically and mentally.<eos> We control the DNA of our progeny... germinating them in birthing pods.<eos> I guess I prefer to make people the old-fashioned way.<eos> Perhaps someday, you could give me a history lesson... in the archaic ways of our ancestors.
Family reunion. Yay.<eos> I understand she is your sister.<eos> She's worth no more to me than the bounty due for her on Xandar.<eos> Our soldiers apprehended her attempting to steal the batteries.<eos> Do with her as you please.
That's all I know.<eos> I see it within you.<eos> An unorthodox genealogy.<eos> A hybrid that seems particularly... reckless.<eos> You know, they told me you people were conceited douchebags... but that isn't true at all.
It seems like this establishment is the wrong kind of disreputable.<eos> - Sir!<eos> - Stakar!<eos> There's a hundred Ravager factions.<eos> You lost the business of 99 of them by serving one.
Because I was a skinny little kid who could squeeze into places adults couldn't. It made it easier for thieving'.<eos> Well, I've been trying to track you down ever since.<eos> I thought Yondu was your father.<eos> We've been together this whole time... and you thought Yondu was my actual blood relative?<eos> You look exactly alike.
Why?<eos> My father would tell the story of impregnating my mother every winter solstice.<eos> That's disgusting.<eos> It was beautiful.<eos> You Earthers have hang-ups.
I didn't mean to do a mutiny.<eos> They killed all my friends.<eos> Get the third quadrant ready for release.<eos> One more thing.<eos> You got any clones of Quill's old music on the ship?
There's no need to get personal.<eos> Listen!<eos> Ego's gotten exactly what he wanted.<eos> I should have told you earlier.<eos> I'm stupid. You are in danger.
What is this place?<eos> Gamora, let her go!<eos> The bodies in the caverns...<eos> Who are they?<eos> You are scared.
It's beautiful.<eos> It is.<eos> And so are you.<eos> On the inside.<eos> You know, it's a shame... that it took the tragedy of losing Yondu to bring us all together again.
I'm not boring!<eos> I am Groot.<eos> And now I know how Yondu felt. In these times of hardship... just remember... We.<eos> Hey, fellas.<eos> Wait, where are you going?
Could I just have one more month?<eos> Please.<eos> Hello?<eos> I'm seriously in like a really bad thing with my landlord.<eos> So, like you wanna come back?
Hello?<eos> I'm seriously in like a really bad thing with my landlord.<eos> So, like you wanna come back?<eos> No, I never left, I just asked for a couple extra weeks off.<eos> Oh shit, you're right.
Justin has been talking about this forever.<eos> Yeah, but my parents will probably need us back in Napa soon, we're part of the headquarters team, but Kenny will run the Vineyard here, once it's set up, so thankfully we don't have to stay.<eos> But, we will be be back and forth<eos> I'm sure, and visiting a lot.<eos> You just do what you need to do, things were hectic for Averall and I too at your age, you've got each other and some day you'll have more time.
But, we will be be back and forth<eos> I'm sure, and visiting a lot.<eos> You just do what you need to do, things were hectic for Averall and I too at your age, you've got each other and some day you'll have more time.<eos> Yeah, we really work well together, it helps with the chaos.<eos> Oh, I understand, such a blessing and you'd be surprised how many people never wind up finding that.
Labels?<eos> Wine labels?<eos> Yes, we will send them over immediately, thank you.<eos> I mean, I can help you guys out with that.<eos> If you have something already, that's totally fine, but you know that's what I do.
Yeah.<eos> Stacy, Stacy, look who's here.<eos> - And look.<eos> - Oh my God, I can't believe it<eos> Wait until you see Heather, she's about to pop.
- Right, I remember.<eos> - Oh, I met him didn't I?<eos> Carrie's been marketing wine tastings for her family since she was like a teenager, tell em babe.<eos> That's right, since I was a kid.<eos> You don't drink that stuff do ya?
You don't drink that stuff do ya?<eos> I got dirty.<eos> Now, why'd you do that?<eos> Come here.<eos> Lauren this might be something good for you to do, - we could sell it together.
Now, why'd you do that?<eos> Come here.<eos> Lauren this might be something good for you to do, - we could sell it together.<eos> - Yeah maybe so.<eos> No, you all could be a lot more generous than that with your pours, I got plenty.
I just wanna make sure we get a prayer in, before people start needing to leave.<eos> I know we've got bed times for some of our little ones.<eos> Also, I want to say how excited we are to welcome back a few of our own.<eos> Lauren, and Justin, and Carrie, it's also so great to have you.<eos> Justin, I was wondering if you'd mind leading us in prayer?
Here, take the floor, state your case, babe.<eos> I just think... maybe<eos> Lauren doesn't need the distraction, I mean, maybe you should just let her feel it instead...<eos> Here you go.<eos> There's a wash cloth here, you just gotta shove it in the drain hole if you need to take a bath.
Lauren doesn't need the distraction, I mean, maybe you should just let her feel it instead...<eos> Here you go.<eos> There's a wash cloth here, you just gotta shove it in the drain hole if you need to take a bath.<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> And I'm leaving a night light on in the hall in case you have to pee-pee.
That's great, is Justin here or Carrie?<eos> Yeah, out in the field with my Mom.<eos> Great.<eos> I thought I'd see you at the funeral.<eos> Oh you went to the funeral?
Great.<eos> I thought I'd see you at the funeral.<eos> Oh you went to the funeral?<eos> Yeah, I, we thought you'd be there.<eos> Yeah, I was sick, but, you went, thank you.
Oh you went to the funeral?<eos> Yeah, I, we thought you'd be there.<eos> Yeah, I was sick, but, you went, thank you.<eos> That's really sweet.<eos> I mean you didn't really have to go, because you barely knew her, but thank you!
But, thank you so much for thinking of me and congratulations on all of this, this is so great!<eos> Really good seeing you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Good seeing you too.<eos> This soil it'll grow anything you've got in California, - or Italy even.
- Thank you.<eos> I think I might know what we need for the labels.<eos> It's, uh, an idea.<eos> But then I could do paintings based on a whole collection.<eos> You know, it's Heartland, but it's like specific.
Wheaties.<eos> Yes.<eos> Ha!<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - You're welcome.
None that count.<eos> Definitely belongs to you then.<eos> Well then let's just take what we have in here I guess.<eos> It's all just stuff.<eos> Well, your mom has been through this before maybe she has some ideas to help you take more and really sort through it.
Oh.<eos> Oh, hi!<eos> Come on in.<eos> So good to see you.<eos> You girls, you remember Kenny right?
Carrie, hello?<eos> Justin?<eos> Hello?<eos> Hello?<eos> You hear them sirens?
And... so he was just around a lot and... we just, you know, kind of kept crossing...<eos> - Paths?<eos> - Paths, yup, and I still remember the first time I...<eos> Oh when are y'all just gonna get married?<eos> You know, my son got married four years back.
Tell her why.<eos> Oh, well, um...<eos> Dynamic essentials.<eos> Kool-aid doesn't have dynamic essentials<eos> Whenever somebody compares Vitamade to an inferior product, you jump right in and you explain what makes our distinct.
I have a magic ingredient that's really gonna help your sales.<eos> Lauren, go to your room this instant.<eos> - Go to my room?<eos> - Get out of here now!<eos> I'm sorry, you can stay. Gail, you can stay, please, Sherri.
Oh, you better believe it's not going to happen again.<eos> I mean, how did it even get to this point?<eos> I was two days!<eos> - A lot happened.<eos> - Are you kidding me?
Living examples of courage without limits<eos> And on that note I would like to hand things off to the mission head with this historic expedition,<eos> Lead Astronaut Sarah Elliot<eos> Sorry if we only have time for a couple of questions.<eos> You know what it's like the night before a trip
We are not in a fight.<eos> This is how you greet an old friend?<eos> If he is unannounced, yes.<eos> It's about the boy.<eos> Mr. Shepherd, you have no idea how smart he is.
This has nothing to do with PR.<eos> I'm talking about a boy's life.<eos> hang on, hang on. Like it or not, but I'm still the founder.<eos> Like it or not, East Texas is still my brainchild.<eos> You know, you got a lot more faith in how the public will respond than I do.
I'm Nathaniel Shepherd.<eos> How you doing?<eos> I am Fine.<eos> I just weigh too much.<eos> I know who you are.
There has been a breach here.<eos> Quarantine.<eos> Word of warning guys, these are the real deal.<eos> The boots are weighed for gravity compensation.<eos> As if you're from Mars returning to Earth.
And those were the highlights of the 19th century industrial revolution.<eos> Now. The 20th century had some of the greatest inventions...<eos> Hello.<eos> - Hello.<eos> And you are?
Edison got jealous and claim AC electrocuted pets.<eos> To prove it, he electrocuted an elephant.<eos> That's not badass.<eos> That's a bad person.<eos> You see folks.
You need to come with me now.<eos> - No.<eos> We are here to help.<eos> You're putting yourself in great danger.<eos> Why can't you just leave me alone?
She died giving birth to me.<eos> Sarah Elliot died from pressure suit failure<eos> That's not.<eos> That's what they said, but...<eos> You're my father.
- Is this some kind of scam?<eos> - No no, he's not lying.<eos> it's the truth. I swear.<eos> I just wanted to meet you.<eos> - Why are you doing this to me?
What do you want from me?<eos> I could never do it.<eos> Just to meet you.<eos> And he is dying.<eos> I do not know who you are or why you are doing this
Hurry!<eos> It's taking too long.<eos> His blood pressure is dropping.<eos> We have to get him out of our gravity.<eos> You have to take the plane higher.
But today, I reclaim this space... to tell you a beautiful story.<eos> Now the rotten CEOs are gone.<eos> It's Mirando's new era with me, and with new core values, environment and life.<eos> Awesome.<eos> You're much more fun than the last chief executive.
And not sparkling water. I don't want to belch my way through the broadcast.<eos> Get him some water.<eos> I don't think they have sparkling water here.<eos> Excuse me, sir.<eos> If you don't mind, Dr. Johnny's a bit thirsty.
Ten years ago, 26 local farmers from 26 far-flung countries were each given a super piglet.<eos> - What's he saying?<eos> - Dunno.<eos> One of those 26 farms to decide who will be invited to the Best Super Pig Fest in New York City, where it will be unveiled to the world.<eos> You've done an incredible job.
She wants me to open the door.<eos> Please state the name you are looking for.<eos> M-U-N-D-O.<eos> Sorry, please speak clearly.<eos> You can't just send anybody up here.
Okja will become a hidden camera.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm sorry, but this was our plan.<eos> Rescue Okja, replace the black box and let Mirando retake Okja.<eos> You want to send Okja to America?
They fucked, not me.<eos> They fucked up.<eos> I know what they're calling me, those A.L.F. fuckers.<eos> They're calling me a psychopath.<eos> You're not a psychopath.
Right, Ms. Mirando?<eos> They're narcissists.<eos> Do narcissists wear balaclavas?<eos> Crazy radicals have been calling us psychopaths since the '60s.<eos> "You're a psychopath. Your sister was a psychopath. Your father was a psychopath."
I mean, that's hardly an unfair slur.<eos> "What did you do in the war, Daddy?"<eos> "I manufactured the napalm that made everybody's skin fall off."<eos> And this is a man who called his child an idiot loser.<eos> Well, in fairness to your father, when he called you an idiot loser, you had just signed up for a two-year course in California called "Unleash Your Calling."
Until six hours ago.<eos> The synthesis of old Mirando and new Mirando was impeccable.<eos> I took nature and science, and I synthesized.<eos> And everyone loved it.<eos> You remember what the New York Times said about our super pigs?
That's it.<eos> That image.<eos> We're dead.<eos> Lucy, may I ask you a question?<eos> The girl. You're thinking of bringing her to New York, aren't you?
Lucy, may I ask you a question?<eos> The girl. You're thinking of bringing her to New York, aren't you?<eos> I was about to say that!<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> You'll invite her to the Best Super Pig Festival and...
She's a godsend!<eos> Are you writing this down?<eos> She's not the face of the Mirando Corporation.<eos> I am.<eos> You don't even know if she can do anything but cry.
I am.<eos> You don't even know if she can do anything but cry.<eos> Whereas I am loved... all over the world.<eos> Could you sit down and shut the fucking squeaking and whining?<eos> You know... You are forcing me...
Oh, really?<eos> Okay.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Examine them.<eos> Are you examining them now?
Examine them.<eos> Are you examining them now?<eos> Have you finished examining them?<eos> Sit.<eos> You're a deadbeat.
Yes!<eos> Our precious farmer princess insists that she speaks to her on the phone.<eos> What?<eos> Whatever. She says you should lift her ear and put the receiver underneath.<eos> - You're on speakerphone!
In New York?<eos> Fuck Nancy.<eos> - She's been here a while.<eos> - I told you to keep her away! She frightens people!<eos> You frighten people, too, Lucy.
Yeah!<eos> The best super pig on the face of the earth?<eos> Yeah!<eos> Are you ready?<eos> Well, I'm afraid you're gonna have to meet somebody else first.
Ladies and gentlemen, put your hands together for the one, the only,<eos> Lucy Mirando!<eos> "Lucy Mirando!"<eos> Fucking idiot.<eos> You look amazing!
"Lucy Mirando!"<eos> Fucking idiot.<eos> You look amazing!<eos> Oh, Johnny.<eos> You're skating on thin ice. Watch out you don't fall in and drown.
That's right, folks.<eos> Go to YouTube now and search "Mirando is F-U-C-K-E-D."<eos> Fucked!<eos> I don't think we have a choice, Nancy.<eos> You have to go out there.
She is.<eos> And that's our best super pig.<eos> Well, what's the hiccup?<eos> Why is it still alive?<eos> Why you want to kill Okja?
Why you want to kill Okja?<eos> Well, we can only sell the dead ones.<eos> I wanna go home with Okja.<eos> No, it's my property.<eos> - You're a fucking psychopath.
Well, we can only sell the dead ones.<eos> I wanna go home with Okja.<eos> No, it's my property.<eos> - You're a fucking psychopath.<eos> - You should be ashamed of yourself.
We all love the face and the anus, as American as apple pie!<eos> Hot dogs.<eos> It's all edible.<eos> All edible, except the squeal.<eos> - So you're the other Mirando.
Hot dogs.<eos> It's all edible.<eos> All edible, except the squeal.<eos> - So you're the other Mirando.<eos> - And you are?
- So you're the other Mirando.<eos> - And you are?<eos> - Let Mija and Okja go.<eos> - Why?<eos> You already have a shitload of money.
You already have a shitload of money.<eos> - Please.<eos> - This is business.<eos> Hey, Nancy!<eos> I hold all creatures dear to my heart, but you are crying out to be an exception.
Well, it's Old Black Man's night to pick the movie.<eos> Yeah, but he's asleep.<eos> Yeah, but, like... why do a remake of The Wizard of Oz? I mean, the original was a classic.<eos> Uh, don't you think it's fair, though, that they get their version?<eos> I mean, it's very difficult being a black person in America, you know?
Oh, my God.<eos> He's gone.<eos> What the hell? What?<eos> Uh... guys?<eos> You're gonna want to see this.
So let's talk fast be-before<eos> - another song starts.<eos> - Okay, so...<eos> Okay, that's a good idea.<eos> You know what the problem is?
- Mm...<eos> - I'm sorry...<eos> Old Man. Just Old Man.<eos> - Yeah. Yeah.<eos> And, um, help him out, you know?
Car 559, responding to robbery in progress.<eos> Shit.<eos> Okay, look, it's all right, all right, calm down, calm down.<eos> It's all good, it's all good.<eos> You know, we can talk our way out of this.

I've ever seen, and you didn't even fill out this form properly.<eos> Not even close.<eos> It's incomplete.<eos> It's worse than sloppy.<eos> I wanted to see you to tell you that if you ever want to find work anyplace, then you better get your act together, do things properly, and start showing some respect for a possible future employer,
That's rough.<eos> Yeah. When do you get those tests back?<eos> Sheriff Truman?<eos> Your wife is here.<eos> She went to your office, and you weren't there.

He's been officially accused now of brutally murdering his wife.<eos> He claims he's innocent and knows who did it, but can't say because it would breach national security.<eos> However... he got word to Chris here that these items, which he placed in his garden in Georgetown, are the clues to the identity of the killer.<eos> The congressman's dilemma.<eos> All right, you all can go get to work on this.
- But that's your truck.<eos> - I know it's my truck.<eos> I can't talk to you about this here. I told you.<eos> Please go away.<eos> But if you weren't driving, I need to know who was.
I'll, uh, saddle up.<eos> MiddleburyDoc.<eos> Be right with you, Doc.<eos> Now.<eos> There you are, Doc.
Be right with you, Doc.<eos> Now.<eos> There you are, Doc.<eos> What's this all about?<eos> Doc, do you remember way back when, the night Harry called you in to examine Special Agent Dale Cooper at the Great Northern?
Oh, yes, Lieutenant.<eos> It's good to meet you.<eos> Detective. Thanks for seeing me.<eos> This shouldn't take long.<eos> You submitted a set of fingerprints a few days ago to our database, and we need to verify the source.
How old was this man?<eos> Late 40s.<eos> When did this man die?<eos> Within the last five or six days.<eos> You're sure this is the body you took those prints from?
Late 40s.<eos> When did this man die?<eos> Within the last five or six days.<eos> You're sure this is the body you took those prints from?<eos> I'm happy to pull 'em again for you, if you like.
Sir. Lieutenant Knox, sir.<eos> It's not just prints this time.<eos> It's a body.<eos> It's him.<eos> You're sure?
The dog leg.<eos> That dog had four legs.<eos> One you found in my trunk.<eos> The other three went out with the information you're thinking about right now.<eos> Two people you don't want coming around here if anything bad happens to me.
That dog had four legs.<eos> One you found in my trunk.<eos> The other three went out with the information you're thinking about right now.<eos> Two people you don't want coming around here if anything bad happens to me.<eos> How do I know you know anything about... this?
One a.m. tonight.<eos> Smooth and safe.<eos> And if your mind should wander to a place where I might not make it out of here alive, remember the dog legs.<eos> I'm not interested in you.<eos> You'll never see me again, and no one will ever hear anything more about Joe McCluskey or your late Mr. Strawberry.
Is there a reason why you didn't report your car missing?<eos> Reason?<eos> Yeah, I'll tell you a reason.<eos> There's more to life than cars.<eos> Too many cars, too much going on, and Dougie's been under a lot of stress lately, and if you want to know the truth, so have I.
Who are you, sir?<eos> He owns this place.<eos> Bushnell Mullins.<eos> Dougie works for me.<eos> You did find his car, didn't you?
Multiple fatalities.<eos> Why didn't you tell us that to begin with?<eos> The deceased individuals had ties to a gang associated with multiple car thefts.<eos> Well, there's your answer.<eos> Now, if you don't mind, our son's home alone waiting for his supper, and in case you think we're neglecting him, he's being watched by our neighbor as a favor, and we'd like to go.
Now, if you don't mind, our son's home alone waiting for his supper, and in case you think we're neglecting him, he's being watched by our neighbor as a favor, and we'd like to go.<eos> We were supposed to be home by now at the end of a very long and stressful day, which I'll tell you about later, Dougie.<eos> - Come on, let's go.<eos> - Hold on.<eos> And I'm sure our being here hasn't made your day any easier, ma'am, but we're gonna need you to fill out some paperwork.
A warden?<eos> All right.<eos> You want Chantal to mess with him before I come?<eos> He'll sing for me.<eos> Whatever you want.
He'll sing for me.<eos> Whatever you want.<eos> Then I got a doubleheader for you in Vegas.<eos> Oh, let's play two.<eos> I'll text you details after you do the warden.
The main road is that way.<eos> He ever give any problems?<eos> No, I never had any trouble with Dougie at all.<eos> He's a... solid citizen.<eos> So you can't think of any reason why someone would try to kill him.
Little more emphasis on the "slow."<eos> Dougie had a car accident, as I recall, not long before he came to work for me.<eos> Every once in a while, he shows some lingering effects.<eos> His wife can talk to that better than I can.<eos> Well... we appreciate you coming down, Bushnell.
I tried to ask him what it was about, but he... he...<eos> He wouldn't say any more.<eos> He just said,<eos> "When they come to ask you about Agent Cooper, you give them this."<eos> And now you're here.
I'm 43.<eos> Mr. Hastings, are you the author of an online journal or blog entitled The Search for the Zone?<eos> What sort of things do you write about?<eos> Different things.<eos> Approximately two weeks ago, did you write an entry about encountering what you described as an alternate reality?
Approximately two weeks ago, did you write an entry about encountering what you described as an alternate reality?<eos> A different dimension.<eos> Yes, but it's real.<eos> It's all real.<eos> How long have you been interested in this subject,
Mr. Hastings?<eos> Many years.<eos> I do...<eos> I do a lot of reading.<eos> But this time, you wrote that you actually found and entered such a place.
I do...<eos> I do a lot of reading.<eos> But this time, you wrote that you actually found and entered such a place.<eos> Yes.<eos> And that while in this place, you wrote, and I quote,
Yes.<eos> You see, Ruth was very good at... uncovering hidden records.<eos> And she had indications that if we went to a certain place at a certain time, we would enter the dimension and make contact with a certain person.<eos> And so we went there.<eos> And that's where you found the Major.
It was something like no one has ever seen before.<eos> I've never seen anything like it.<eos> I... I've never... I've...<eos> I've never read anything like it.<eos> You don't know. You weren't there.
And then... and then I woke up, and I was in... I was in my home.<eos> I was in my home.<eos> Did the Major kill Ruth?<eos> No, there were so many people there.<eos> You have to believe me.
You have to believe me.<eos> Please, I didn't kill Ruth.<eos> I loved her. I loved her.<eos> I don't know what is happening to me.<eos> Why can't you help me, please?
Otherworldly.<eos> Beverly.<eos> I can't do this.<eos> I don't know why it is.<eos> You're a good man, Ben.
I'm your Kryptonite.<eos> Hmm. Not sure what RatPac does, but that logo is macho.<eos> I dig it.<eos> Okay. Get yourself ready for some reading.<eos> "If you want to make the world a better place"
I don't need you.<eos> I don't need anyone.<eos> You mean nothing to me.<eos> No one does.<eos> Batman! You did it!
Certainly, sir.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - No worries.<eos> Anything exciting happen when I was gone?<eos> You have four pieces of mail.
Great, what'd I get?<eos> You have this week's Pennysaver, two bills, and a coupon for Bed Bath and Beyond. It expires in two weeks. But I've heard that some stores will honor them past the expiry date.<eos> Copy that.<eos> Also, Alfred is on the 17th floor, grouting tiles in the second bathroom of the fifth master bedroom.<eos> Do you want me to tell Alfred you're home?
Love it!<eos> Hey, Mom.<eos> Hey, Dad.<eos> I saved the city again today.<eos> I wish you could have seen me.
Hey, Dad.<eos> I saved the city again today.<eos> I wish you could have seen me.<eos> I think you would have been really proud.<eos> There you are!
24/7, 365, at a million percent.<eos> And if you think that there's something behind that, then you're crazy.<eos> Good night, Alfred.<eos> Sir, it's morning.<eos> Master Bruce, you live on an island, figuratively and literally.
Sir, it's morning.<eos> Master Bruce, you live on an island, figuratively and literally.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I love it.<eos> You can't spend the rest of your life alone, dressed in black, listening to angry music, and staying up all night.
- Indubitably.<eos> Good. Must be nice to be happy.<eos> Tonight, on Metropolis in Focus, we have our favorite star, Superman!<eos> What up, Gotham!<eos> Superman, tell me. How do you feel about your recent banishment of Zod to the Phantom Zone?
- Mr. Wayne, good to see you.<eos> - Senator, looking great.<eos> I'm starting with the man in the mirror Bruce, any advice for the new commissioner?<eos> Long as he knows how to push the button for the Bat-Signal, he'll be fine.<eos> Bruce, I don't know how you did it.
- Yes. - Hi.<eos> Bruce Wayne.<eos> Billionaire, bon vivant, gallivanter, playboy,<eos> Gotham's most eligible bachelor, like, 90 years in a row.<eos> - That's me right there. - I know who you are, Mr. Wayne.
Team, I got the Joker in my sights.<eos> Joker. Uh, excuse me? I was about to...<eos> Push the Bat-Signal? Good call. I like your instincts.<eos> I've got a surprise for you guys.<eos> And it's gonna make you smile.
I'm... Sorry, not you.<eos> We're talking to Commissioner Gordon.<eos> - Well, it was a team effort.<eos> - I got this, Babs.<eos> Commissioner, how do you feel?
Toodle-oo, Batman! - Bye, Batman.<eos> Today is a victory for the citizens of Gotham City!<eos> No more crime! No more crime!<eos> No more crime! Is everything okay, sir?<eos> You've barely touched your lobster thermidor.
No more crime! Is everything okay, sir?<eos> You've barely touched your lobster thermidor.<eos> I don't have time to eat lobster thermidor right now!<eos> Barbara!<eos> What are you doing?
That's my motto. Copyright Batman.<eos> Batman, there are no more vigilantes allowed in Gotham City.<eos> Okay. Totally got it.<eos> Then I have to go into double-secret super vigilante mode.<eos> You said that out loud.
You need to take responsibility for your life.<eos> Not right now, I don't.<eos> And it starts by raising your son.<eos> I'm sorry. I literally have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> The young orphan you adopted at the gala.
Hello, table!<eos> Boom! And I must say, I've grown rather fond of the young lad.<eos> Hello, secret camera.<eos> You should get to know him.<eos> We are family - You and he have a lot in common.
- Whatever it is. Listen, you don't have a family.<eos> You're satisfied serving me.<eos> So what do you know about having a surrogate son?<eos> Now, I'm gonna go fight crime while you put that kid on the next jet to the orphanage.<eos> As you wish, sir.
As long as you're in the Phantom Zone, I'll be saving Gotham City, and that's all that matters to me.<eos> Goodbye, Joker.<eos> Oh, Batman, thank you!<eos> Yes! That's what I call saving the city again!<eos> Batman, what are you doing?
I'm Batman, I'm awesome I got a nine-pack<eos> Stop it!<eos> Batman, I can't believe you did this.<eos> Hi, police lady.<eos> And even worse, you've made this kid into an accessory to your crime.
Officers, take this Projector to the evidence room.<eos> - You got it. - And get this man some pants.<eos> I'm good the way I am.<eos> B Go, why has nobody fist bumped me yet?<eos> You know, when I was a kid, I wanted to be you, Batman.
I'm good the way I am.<eos> B Go, why has nobody fist bumped me yet?<eos> You know, when I was a kid, I wanted to be you, Batman.<eos> I wanted to be as strong and as fast and as smart as Batman.<eos> But you're not who I thought you were.
I think you're underestimating the importance of the Joker being in the Phantom Zone.<eos> Really, it's kind of a stroke of genius.<eos> All the... Hey, where are you going?<eos> I just put Joker in the one place he can't do anyone any harm.<eos> But what if you just gave Joker exactly what he wanted?
Whoa!<eos> Look at this place! Am I being too loud?<eos> Sorry. I always do that.<eos> How about a warning next time?<eos> You're so right, and I am so wrong.
I'm a really bad person.<eos> But with vulnerabilities.<eos> Who, me?<eos> No way.<eos> So, where do you keep all the other bad people in this place?
- Yay! And I ain't talking about those rogue losers dressed in cosplay!<eos> - Me-ouch.<eos> I'm talking about my new peeps!<eos> And they're just like me.<eos> The greatest villains you'll ever see.
I hate to say this, but you're right. The city needs you.<eos> Yes!<eos> Let me out. I'm only going to let you out on one condition.<eos> - Name it.<eos> - You can't do it by yourself.
- How did you... - Alfred, you gotta let me out of here.<eos> Sir, those creatures out there are unlike anything we've ever seen.<eos> Speak for yourself.<eos> You don't know everything I've seen. I haven't told you everything.<eos> And you'll never be able to defeat them alone.
You don't know everything I've seen. I haven't told you everything.<eos> And you'll never be able to defeat them alone.<eos> And it'll be more fun if we all do it together!<eos> What's the worst thing that could happen?<eos> What are you so afraid of?
Well, luckily for us, you left your costume back at the...<eos> - Rip!<eos> - Oh! Nope. Under your clothes.<eos> That's perfect.<eos> - Alfred, what are you doing?
Engine four!<eos> That I do need to fix.<eos> Good news. Our bathroom problem is solved.<eos> You three wait here while I go fix the engine.<eos> Don't worry, Batman. You fix the Batwing, I'll fly.
Unhand him, you animatronic fiends.<eos> What are you two doing here?<eos> I told you to stay in the cockpit.<eos> You disobeyed me. You're on a timeout.<eos> Batman, you're on a timeout.
You disobeyed me. You're on a timeout.<eos> Batman, you're on a timeout.<eos> What? Alfred, you better un-timeout me right now!<eos> No. Not until you un-timeout Master Dick.<eos> Guys, you're all un-timeouted! We have incoming!
that's not possible.<eos> I'm Danny Rand.<eos> The son of Wendell Rand.<eos> been away a long time.<eos> And you're here to see Harold Meachum?
Danny Rand.<eos> How did you get up here?<eos> uh...<eos> I came to see your father.<eos> but I think you're in the wrong place.
He died of cancer 12 years ago.<eos> I'm gonna show you... then.<eos> All our parents are gone now.<eos> thanks for dropping by.<eos> What you need is to get out of my office.
We can have a cup of tea. We can talk about this.<eos> Stage Deli's been closed for years.<eos> okay?<eos> I just want to talk.<eos> You are absolutely insane if you think I'm gonna sit down and have a cup of tea with you.
I just want to talk.<eos> You are absolutely insane if you think I'm gonna sit down and have a cup of tea with you.<eos> but...<eos> - Really?<eos> You think?
It could be anyone.<eos> So you're thinking this is some sort of corporate sabotage?<eos> doesn't it?<eos> sir.<eos> Hey! What the hell are you doing?
I just need to talk.<eos> Pull over.<eos> Put the gun away.<eos> okay?<eos> You can talk to the police. That's who you can talk to.
Please... put the gun away.<eos> How does it feel?<eos> Not so good.<eos> Bang!<eos> You will never get a penny from us.
I know you know more.<eos> I was 15 when they died.<eos> Why would I know anything more?<eos> And why do you think that there's more to know?<eos> And why do you care?
Why would I know anything more?<eos> And why do you think that there's more to know?<eos> And why do you care?<eos> I am.<eos> Show me a DNA test that proves you're a Rand.
I have no living relatives.<eos> A fingerprint test.<eos> I... I was ten when we crashed.<eos> - I never had fingerprints taken.<eos> - Then you've got nothing. man.
- I never had fingerprints taken.<eos> - Then you've got nothing. man.<eos> You know what?<eos> and you're still a dick now.<eos> - You don't know anything about me.
Please take some flyers.<eos> invite your friends to take a class.<eos> We need more students here.<eos> also... Thursday nights will be closed for AA meetings.<eos> They pay more than you do.
- With guns.<eos> - Shannon?<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Very sure.<eos> you seem to have gotten away.
Yeah.<eos> This time.<eos> I have to believe that it was something he... might have instigated on his own.<eos> it... doesn't make a difference.<eos> You know... my brother's a very black and white kind of guy.
You know... my brother's a very black and white kind of guy.<eos> Something's either true... or it isn't.<eos> I'm a little more... open.<eos> Meaning?<eos> You look like Danny Rand.
There you are.
That's usually the first thing people say.<eos> Can you loosen these straps?<eos> I'm afraid I can't do.<eos> Not just yet.<eos> Word is you like to put up a fight.
I need to get out of here.<eos> I know how disorienting it must be to... to wake up and find yourself in a place like this.<eos> we're here to help.<eos> And I think I know exactly how.<eos> You need to kill yourself.
And I think I know exactly how.<eos> You need to kill yourself.<eos> It's really the only solution for any of us.<eos> and they keep saving me.<eos> while you have a chance.
- No.<eos> - Yes?<eos> Simon... no!<eos> I was just saying hello to the new guy.<eos> We're gonna get you cleaned up now.
It's the drugs.<eos> You need to let me out of here.<eos> it's either here or jail. so I think we should make the most of it.<eos> Can... can you at least unstrap me?<eos> Are you gonna behave?
I woke up.<eos> I was in this huge snowdrift.<eos> I was hurt.<eos> It was snowing.<eos> You must have been cold.
They were warrior monks.<eos> Let's just put that on hold for a moment and switch gears.<eos> Why don't we talk about what happened with John Anderson?<eos> Who's that?<eos> isn't that you?
isn't it?<eos> That's your picture.<eos> Canada.<eos> I've never seen that before.<eos> If you want out of here... you're gonna have to start being honest with me.
I can't.<eos> I'll just end up crying.<eos> guys.<eos> These exercises are about trying to teach you so... do better.<eos> You ready?
one of my most trusted guys.<eos> Do this for me.<eos> How you feeling this morning?<eos> Drugs make me feel like I'm under water. but I understand that's what it takes with you.<eos> You haven't been as cooperative as we'd like.
Drugs make me feel like I'm under water. but I understand that's what it takes with you.<eos> You haven't been as cooperative as we'd like.<eos> I lied... about the passport.<eos> that's a step in the right direction.<eos> So you're ready to be John Anderson?
I'm sorry to intrude.<eos> My name is Ward Meachum.<eos> What can I do for you?<eos> this is rather awkward.<eos> I'm wondering if you've had any contact with a man who's going by the name Danny?
I think he has some serious mental problems.<eos> so how did you find me? note anyone that he might be in contact with.<eos> Your name was on the list.<eos> I don't know the guy.<eos> But you've met him?
But you've met him?<eos> He came around here once.<eos> Did he... hurt you... in any way?<eos> That'd be a mistake.<eos> It would be very helpful for us if you would be willing to sign some papers that would attest that you felt threatened by him.
The man needs help.<eos> I think Rand would be happy to set up a... neighborhood improvement donation... to be spent however you choose.<eos> Move your damn car!<eos> How about this?<eos> simply say the man... acted unusually... made you feel uncomfortable.
How about this?<eos> simply say the man... acted unusually... made you feel uncomfortable.<eos> I just don't think...<eos> I'll give you some time to think about it.<eos> You'd be doing us a great favor.
I'll give you some time to think about it.<eos> You'd be doing us a great favor.<eos> Bit of money would really... bring this place up a notch.<eos> Come in.<eos> but since you're already here...
Joy was on the other side.<eos> We had popcorn.<eos> John Anderson.<eos> That's your name.<eos> You are not Danny Rand.
John Anderson.<eos> That's your name.<eos> You are not Danny Rand.<eos> I am Danny Rand.<eos> I don't care what you think!
I miss him.<eos> But now... I don't apologize for anything.<eos> get the car ready tonight.<eos> the thing with the four wheels.<eos> it's just... you never leave the penthouse.
This is Dr. Paul Edmonds from the Birch Psychiatric Hospital.<eos> I'm treating the patient your family admitted.<eos> how can I help you?<eos> I'm wondering if I can ask you an odd question.<eos> okay. you did a commercial for Rand?
Did you do anything afterwards?<eos> yeah.<eos> The circus.<eos> we all went to the circus afterwards.<eos> You're sure?
it was... it was an odd question.<eos> Why do you ask?<eos> I'm afraid I can't really say.<eos> Patient confidentiality.<eos> now you have me curious.
- Thanks. - Mmm-hmm.<eos> Does this look like the guy who was in here the other day?<eos> I couldn't really say.<eos> I just... then what we're doing to him... it's pretty shitty.<eos> You said it's probably not him.
Hi.<eos> Me again. but I was hoping we could make a trade.<eos> yeah?<eos> What kind of trade?<eos> If you sign these... then...
What kind of trade?<eos> If you sign these... then...<eos> I will leave you this.<eos> 000?<eos> - You could do a lot with that.
Heather!<eos> Special delivery.<eos> What is it?<eos> From Joy Meachum.<eos> You have a visitor.
I was just going to see you.<eos> My 72 hours are almost up.<eos> Time to let me go.<eos> I'm gonna be making that decision very soon.<eos> where did you go to school?
I believe all that.<eos> But the rest... one that... helps us deal with the loss and suffering.<eos> Iron Fists... special.<eos> I... I... I don't think I understand.<eos> I'm gonna suggest that you have an anxiety disorder with psychotic features. because now it means we can make a plan for treatment.
I'm happy for you to convince me.<eos> Do... do you want to show me the Iron Fist?<eos> Let's see how it works.<eos> I can't.<eos> Not... not until you take me off these drugs.
Do... do you want to show me the Iron Fist?<eos> Let's see how it works.<eos> I can't.<eos> Not... not until you take me off these drugs.<eos> What I'd like for you to do... is to open yourself to the possibility that there is no Iron Fist.
Looks like more people are beginning to realize this is the real Danny Rand.<eos> I found nothing on Iron Fist. but nothing helpful.<eos> A mystery.<eos> purchasing this property which will prove very valuable down the line.<eos> If you take a look at the prospectus...
And I can take care of myself.<eos> - If he does try to contact you...<eos> - That'd be a mistake.<eos> I want nothing to do with anything Rand.<eos> As you can see.
I thought you understood.<eos> I have to live in the real world, Danny.<eos> This is how it works!<eos> I've been meaning to ask... what's this?<eos> You should see the other guy.
Darryl... please.<eos> - How many times?<eos> - Come on, sensei.<eos> I got my moms and two brothers.<eos> You think I could cover that with what I make pushing a broom?
- Come on, sensei.<eos> I got my moms and two brothers.<eos> You think I could cover that with what I make pushing a broom?<eos> I get it, but those private fights are illegal.<eos> All the shit I could've got into, you want to bust me for making a dollar fighting?
I have to live today.<eos> You dishonor yourself when you fight for money.<eos> There's more at stake here than just your bills.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Are you the one who takes care of these?
- Step away from me!<eos> - Wait, wait.<eos> I said step away from me.<eos> Hey, J-Money, it's Danny Rand.<eos> - Look, you remember me, right?
I said step away from me.<eos> Hey, J-Money, it's Danny Rand.<eos> - Look, you remember me, right?<eos> - No.<eos> Come on. You were an intern in the legal department in my dad's office?
Hey, J-Money, it's Danny Rand.<eos> - Look, you remember me, right?<eos> - No.<eos> Come on. You were an intern in the legal department in my dad's office?<eos> You called his secretary Margaret a hatchet-faced bitch.
- No.<eos> Come on. You were an intern in the legal department in my dad's office?<eos> You called his secretary Margaret a hatchet-faced bitch.<eos> I was standing right there.<eos> You gave me five bucks to keep quiet.
You called his secretary Margaret a hatchet-faced bitch.<eos> I was standing right there.<eos> You gave me five bucks to keep quiet.<eos> Where was my office?<eos> Um... you didn't have one.
Thank you.<eos> The least I could do.<eos> Your father gave me my first job.<eos> He always wanted Rand to be something good in the world.<eos> I'm guessing you're not a fan of the Meachums?
They don't play well with others.<eos> We need to dig up every shred of physical evidence we can find to prove your identity.<eos> Was I wrong?<eos> To turn down $100 million?<eos> It may have been the smartest thing you did, other than coming to me.
We need to dig up every shred of physical evidence we can find to prove your identity.<eos> Was I wrong?<eos> To turn down $100 million?<eos> It may have been the smartest thing you did, other than coming to me.<eos> You are worth billions, Danny.
You are worth billions, Danny.<eos> Not millions.<eos> It seems like that's all anyone wants to talk about.<eos> Because it's the only language that they speak.<eos> And it is important that you learn to understand it if you want to win.
It seems like that's all anyone wants to talk about.<eos> Because it's the only language that they speak.<eos> And it is important that you learn to understand it if you want to win.<eos> They're supposed to be my friends.<eos> I can help you get your business back, but I cannot help you make friends.
I think I'm ready.<eos> We are disappointed.<eos> I'm sorry to hear that.<eos> There are discussions about your loyalty.<eos> Why? I'm doing everything you ask.
I needed to see for myself.<eos> And?<eos> It's not going to be a problem.<eos> We have an agreement.<eos> You must honor it to the letter or there will be consequences.
Enough!<eos> The dojo is a place of respect.<eos> And who the hell are you?<eos> Maybe you wanna test me and find out.<eos> You chatter like monkeys.
Already?<eos> What is this? I thought we were headed to a restaurant.<eos> We'll get there.<eos> But first things first.<eos> Trust me, you're gonna like this.
Uh... yeah. Sure.<eos> Danny, it's gone, too.<eos> Now I think that the Meachums are behind it, of course.<eos> If we do not have something definitive, we are going to lose, and I don't like that.<eos> Is there anything you didn't tell me? Something you might have missed?
We don't want you here.<eos> Danny, listen... we can work this out, okay?<eos> I have Hogarth now.<eos> We're coming for you.<eos> You can't deny what's mine.
All right! How do you think of this guy, huh?<eos> How about some respect?<eos> Well done!<eos> Now, I told you it was gonna be a great night, didn't I?<eos> Yeah! Well, I hope you didn't lose your money on that one.
I thought so.<eos> But since the time of your last offer, we have had a change of heart as well.<eos> We are still insisting on the full rights guaranteed as the sole heir of Rand, which includes a controlling 51%, board seat and compensation, but we are now adding a corner office, support staff, and a housing allowance in the amount of one million per year.<eos> Your sense of humor has always been your best attribute, but come on.<eos> You can't even prove he's who he says he is.
You can't even prove he's who he says he is.<eos> At best he's crazy, at worst he's a con man.<eos> Take the offer and be thankful that we don't sue you.<eos> Ward...<eos> I'm glad you mentioned my sense of humor. I thought it was my ass.
Is it?<eos> But here we are.<eos> So... are we good?<eos> Danny?<eos> You're all I've got.
You know the rules about cell phones in my dojo.<eos> Line up.<eos> Make seiza.<eos> Darryl.<eos> I'm sorry, Sensei, but they never get to see you go all out.
I don't need an apology.<eos> What you did was awesome.<eos> I posted it online.<eos> You what?<eos> People gotta see what a badass you are and come for lessons.
What did you do?<eos> Oh, I, uh, pretty much had to raise the dead.<eos> Well, anyway, let's get you signing these before anybody changes their minds.<eos> So, uh... what is my job?<eos> Well, you don't actually hold a position here.
So, uh... what is my job?<eos> Well, you don't actually hold a position here.<eos> - But I thought...<eos> - Oh, let me... let me explain.<eos> As 51% shareholder, you hold the most dominant position on the board.
Well, you don't actually hold a position here.<eos> - But I thought...<eos> - Oh, let me... let me explain.<eos> As 51% shareholder, you hold the most dominant position on the board.<eos> So as much as you don't have a say in the day-to-day business...
So as much as you don't have a say in the day-to-day business...<eos> - My voice will still be heard.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> Do you think we can get access to the Rand business accounts and records?<eos> Well, with your name and your holdings... shouldn't be much you can't access.
Do you think we can get access to the Rand business accounts and records?<eos> Well, with your name and your holdings... shouldn't be much you can't access.<eos> Word to the wise?<eos> Ease into things.<eos> For most of these people, you are a hostile takeover.
For most of these people, you are a hostile takeover.<eos> Okay. Yeah, sure.<eos> No problem.<eos> I'm gonna send a courier to pick up these contracts once you're done.<eos> Daniel... you have an extraordinary opportunity here.
What is it?<eos> Leishmaniasis.<eos> If left untreated, latest numbers show roughly 50,000 a year.<eos> And we have the cure?<eos> We can save lives at five bucks a pill, but you wanna raise the price?
- Okay.<eos> - We have to call the police.<eos> - I know where they're going.<eos> - What?<eos> You have no idea how bad it is.
So we're in our pricing-strategy meeting, getting ready to boost the price, make a huge profit, and be able to fund years' worth of new lab research.<eos> - Sure.<eos> - In walks Danny, and he uses the full weight of his majority shareholdings to force us to sell the drug at cost.<eos> At cost.<eos> - You're kidding me.
- You're kidding me.<eos> That is a loss of hundreds of millions of dollars.<eos> He is worse than these bleeding-heart-liberal-trust-fund hipsters wandering around Williamsburg.<eos> Uh, thanks for the interview.<eos> What, you're leaving so soon?
What?<eos> We had a deal with the previous tenant.<eos> Joy Meachum broke that deal.<eos> We wanted words with her.<eos> You wanted to kidnap Joy to broker a new deal.
Joy Meachum broke that deal.<eos> We wanted words with her.<eos> You wanted to kidnap Joy to broker a new deal.<eos> Maybe we should use you to broker a new deal.<eos> Is this why you walk into my place?
We wanted words with her.<eos> You wanted to kidnap Joy to broker a new deal.<eos> Maybe we should use you to broker a new deal.<eos> Is this why you walk into my place?<eos> I'm here to let you know it's not within your best interests to come near Joy ever again.
That doesn't mean I don't wanna know what the hell was going on tonight.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You and me both.<eos> See you.<eos> You have been a good and faithful servant to the Hand.
I wanna tell you about this great new product.<eos> It will only take a minute.<eos> I guarantee you've never seen anything like this.
Pills, patch, powder, drops.<eos> It's 100% pure... 100% of the time.<eos> Boasting a faster absorption rate, a slower metabolic rate... and the most exciting part, the CP450 liver enzyme inhibitor.<eos> Which prevents the human body from ever building a tolerance to it.<eos> So, as you can see...
Why not let an expert be the judge?<eos> Oh, honey, you don't need to worry about that mess anymore.<eos> This is ridiculous.<eos> What the hell is this?<eos> If you broke him...
I'm gonna deal with this.<eos> How are you... - Hey.<eos> Thank you so much for your help, Sandi.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Inside, you'll find all the reports from federal, state, and local agencies.
I have 15 documented cancer diagnoses that say you're wrong.<eos> I acknowledge how terribly unfortunate this is, but Rand Enterprises had nothing to do with it.<eos> So it's just a coincidence that all the victims live within a one-mile radius of your facility?<eos> We have been compliant with every applicable environmental law and regulation.<eos> I'm afraid you're looking for something that isn't there.
I'm afraid you're looking for something that isn't there.<eos> We'll be hiring our own team to do the looking.<eos> That's your prerogative.<eos> We have nothing to hide.<eos> But if you do manage to establish a connection to the emissions from that plant... our company still followed the law.
- I'll leave you to it then.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - Megan?<eos> - Yes, Mr. Rand?<eos> You're an assistant, right?
- Thanks.<eos> - Megan?<eos> - Yes, Mr. Rand?<eos> You're an assistant, right?<eos> Does that kind of mean you're, like, my apprentice?
No, I'm here to help with scheduling, phone calls, day-to-day stuff around the office.<eos> Oh, like this morning when I wanted to speak to one of our Rand scientists.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> - Right.<eos> So, um, if I wanted you to go out and buy me, say, a box of Fruit Roll-Ups... you'd have to do it.
That's the last thing a control freak wants to hear.<eos> I'm gonna talk to him.<eos> Mr. Rand?<eos> Sorry, do I know you?<eos> I read about that drug thing you did in the paper.
I'm gonna talk to him.<eos> Mr. Rand?<eos> Sorry, do I know you?<eos> I read about that drug thing you did in the paper.<eos> You have the power to change things at this company.
I don't understand.<eos> He got it from the Rand chemical plant near where we live.<eos> It's spewing poison into the air, the ground, all around us.<eos> - I didn't know. I...<eos> - You're different than the others.
You what?<eos> Sorry.<eos> I'm in the middle of a lesson.<eos> - Claire Temple. - Hey.<eos> How do you know each other?
I've never had takeout like this before.<eos> - Oh, the thing is, it's...<eos> - A great idea.<eos> It's a really, really good idea.<eos> You're different than the others.
To the precious Buddha, the unsurpassable teacher.<eos> To the precious dharma, the unsurpassable protection.<eos> To the precious sangha, the unsurpassable guides.<eos> To you three rare and supreme sources of refuge, I offer.<eos> So when you were at that monastery, could you get a burger, or was it all just vegetarian crap?
Donkey?<eos> Donkey's actually pretty good.<eos> My grandmother could stir fry the shit out of donkey and veggies.<eos> I'll take your word for it.<eos> When you weren't sneaking out... were you just waiting around... what, meditating?
Not exactly.<eos> We learned martial arts.<eos> That must have been tough with you being so young.<eos> It was what it was.<eos> Well, still... after everything you'd been through with the crash...
I would love to stick around and hear more, but I've gotta get going.<eos> You don't have to go.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Um, do you mind?<eos> No, take whatever you want.
Up the field.<eos> Oh, that's a lovely ball.<eos> Back again...<eos> Who are you?<eos> Who are you?
- Is he shot?<eos> - He's been stabbed.<eos> We need to get him to a hospital.<eos> Jump in.<eos> You don't understand.
You can't trust anyone!<eos> Hey, hey, hey. Relax.<eos> - Take me back. Take me back.<eos> - Shh. No, you need to relax.<eos> It's okay, you're safe here.
The Hand.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> You gotta be kidding me.<eos> What?<eos> You know about the Hand?
What?<eos> You know about the Hand?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What do you know?<eos> That you just started a war by taking him from them.
You know about the Hand?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What do you know?<eos> That you just started a war by taking him from them.<eos> Do you realize that?
The Hand is everywhere.<eos> Why did they want you here in New York?<eos> Heroin.<eos> I invented a formula.<eos> You were gonna make it here and export it to the world.
This is the one thing I know I can do better than anyone else.<eos> I am the only one who can defeat them.<eos> God! My mother says I can't escape meeting people like you.<eos> That it's my destiny.<eos> 'Cause if you really believe that you can take these sons of bitches out... then I have to believe, too.
I am the only one who can defeat them.<eos> God! My mother says I can't escape meeting people like you.<eos> That it's my destiny.<eos> 'Cause if you really believe that you can take these sons of bitches out... then I have to believe, too.<eos> But going against them on your own, that's some foolish bullshit, no matter who you are.
That's Danny's problem.<eos> Our problem... is if he continues to decline, there'll be nobody for his daughter to come back to.<eos> If I go to the hospital, I'll be arrested.<eos> And they will kill Sabina.<eos> - Hey, hey, hey. - You have no idea what they're capable of.
In K'un-Lun, yeah.<eos> Not against the Hand, but in order to advance and rise through the ranks, I challenged and was challenged in return.<eos> Many times.<eos> It was a regular part of my life.<eos> You're serious?
We haven't got much time.<eos> Too risky.<eos> Sundown.<eos> Of course.<eos> Danny, what you're talking about is crazy.
I'm not just an ordinary fighter, okay?<eos> I'm the Iron Fist.<eos> The hell does that mean?<eos> It means I never lose.<eos> The more you talk... the weirder this gets.
- Did you empty my trash can?<eos> - Maintenance came by early today.<eos> - Why? - I...<eos> I didn't ask.<eos> Do you want me to...
Your father did.<eos> Learned a lot from him.<eos> He always said, "Find fruit in failure."<eos> That he did.<eos> And you have more YouTube views than that incredible green guy, which is its own sort of success.
The Iron Fist accepts the challenge of the Grand Duel in the name of the holy city of K'un-Lun.<eos> My terms are that, upon my victory, the Hand will relinquish custody of the young woman Sabina... and depart from Rand.<eos> Welcome.<eos> My master agrees to your terms.<eos> Should you lose, but remain alive, you must remove yourself from all of our dealings.
Thank you.<eos> Appreciate it.<eos> Shit.<eos> Claire.<eos> Heard you were on the floor.
Appreciate it.<eos> Shit.<eos> Claire.<eos> Heard you were on the floor.<eos> - You heard I was on the floor? - Mmm.
Fine, um... put him at the head of the queue.<eos> Gentlemen, get him on a gurney.<eos> Thanks, Shirley.<eos> Sure.<eos> What are you doin'?
Reveals who you are.<eos> The second battle is won.<eos> Are you hurt?<eos> Barely.<eos> If you wish to withdraw...
I never believed I would meet another Iron Fist in my lifetime.<eos> I had hoped.<eos> But why are you in New York?<eos> Who are you?<eos> It seems you haven't come to destroy us, so I'm curious.
Who are you?<eos> It seems you haven't come to destroy us, so I'm curious.<eos> Answer my question.<eos> I am Madame Gao.<eos> Do you remember the katsura tree in the center of K'un-Lun Square?
It seems you haven't come to destroy us, so I'm curious.<eos> Answer my question.<eos> I am Madame Gao.<eos> Do you remember the katsura tree in the center of K'un-Lun Square?<eos> You've been to K'un-Lun.
My reasons are my own.<eos> Like the girl?<eos> I am entertained by how your mind works.<eos> Has life inside the monastery changed so much?<eos> Because you seem so different from those I remember.
Yes.<eos> Something I thought your father, Wendell, could use more of.<eos> What did you say?<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> You knew my father?
It's, uh... it's Silybum marianum.<eos> Milk thistle.<eos> It's good for the liver.<eos> Why is it that a man who is so obsessed with his own longevity... can be so careless with the people who control his fate?<eos> The Hand is concerned with this rebellious streak you've shown.
Milk thistle.<eos> It's good for the liver.<eos> Why is it that a man who is so obsessed with his own longevity... can be so careless with the people who control his fate?<eos> The Hand is concerned with this rebellious streak you've shown.<eos> You left the confines of your penthouse.
Danny Rand.<eos> The lost heir to your company.<eos> Yes.<eos> He and Madame Gao met earlier tonight.<eos> She finds it odd that you failed to mention the man whose identity you helped restore is also the legendary Iron Fist, the sworn enemy of the Hand.
She finds it odd that you failed to mention the man whose identity you helped restore is also the legendary Iron Fist, the sworn enemy of the Hand.<eos> Danny Rand doesn't even know I'm alive.<eos> I have no idea what an iron fist is.<eos> Sounds like a sex toy.<eos> Maybe you really are telling us the truth right now, and you really have no idea what you brought into this company.
Danny Rand doesn't even know I'm alive.<eos> I have no idea what an iron fist is.<eos> Sounds like a sex toy.<eos> Maybe you really are telling us the truth right now, and you really have no idea what you brought into this company.<eos> Maybe you really are just a fool.
Come on!<eos> God.<eos> You can do this.<eos> You can do this.<eos> You think I don't know that?
Well, now is the time for the hard work to actually start.<eos> I need you to just do what I say at this meeting today, so we can get this situation fixed.<eos> - Danny?<eos> - Hey, I'll be there, okay?<eos> You really need to take better care of yourself, Danny.
Poison arrows can weaken the soul over time.<eos> That's better.<eos> Don't you agree?<eos> How did you get in here?<eos> I've been in Rand far longer than you have.
Don't you agree?<eos> How did you get in here?<eos> I've been in Rand far longer than you have.<eos> And I don't plan on leaving anytime soon.<eos> You're not going to attack an old woman in front of all your employees, are you?
And I don't plan on leaving anytime soon.<eos> You're not going to attack an old woman in front of all your employees, are you?<eos> I think Danny Rand is in enough trouble around here.<eos> I passed your test.<eos> You know who I am.
I think Danny Rand is in enough trouble around here.<eos> I passed your test.<eos> You know who I am.<eos> What I can do.<eos> You're not the first I've met to carry the mantle of the Iron Fist.
History says that the Iron Fist and the Hand are mortal enemies.<eos> But I wonder... in the spirit of change, perhaps we can be something different.<eos> Last night showed me the truth.<eos> K'un-Lun did not send you to hunt us down.<eos> You left of your own free will, because you wanted to be Danny Rand.
But I wonder... in the spirit of change, perhaps we can be something different.<eos> Last night showed me the truth.<eos> K'un-Lun did not send you to hunt us down.<eos> You left of your own free will, because you wanted to be Danny Rand.<eos> So, why not enjoy the life you traveled so far for?
Buy a yacht.<eos> Eat at fancy restaurants with your friends, like Claire Temple and Colleen Wing.<eos> Stop your war.<eos> This city is no place for the Iron Fist.<eos> You're a businessman now... and this is the best offer you are ever going to get.
- No, ma'am.<eos> We should brighten up this office, yes?<eos> I'll put in an order for some lamps.<eos> Come.<eos> You shouldn't be here.
I'll put in an order for some lamps.<eos> Come.<eos> You shouldn't be here.<eos> Why, Mr. Rand, I have a mind to report you to HR.<eos> You think this is a game?
Come.<eos> You shouldn't be here.<eos> Why, Mr. Rand, I have a mind to report you to HR.<eos> You think this is a game?<eos> You're using my company, my building, to sell poison!
You shouldn't be here.<eos> Why, Mr. Rand, I have a mind to report you to HR.<eos> You think this is a game?<eos> You're using my company, my building, to sell poison!<eos> Is that really so different than what you're doing on the top floor?
You think this is a game?<eos> You're using my company, my building, to sell poison!<eos> Is that really so different than what you're doing on the top floor?<eos> Do it.<eos> You're scared.
You're using my company, my building, to sell poison!<eos> Is that really so different than what you're doing on the top floor?<eos> Do it.<eos> You're scared.<eos> You don't even have a choice.
You can't go back to Gao.<eos> She killed the last guy who failed to defeat me.<eos> Turned his head into a mailbox.<eos> I'm giving you a new choice.<eos> You're gonna leave my building.
She killed the last guy who failed to defeat me.<eos> Turned his head into a mailbox.<eos> I'm giving you a new choice.<eos> You're gonna leave my building.<eos> You're gonna run, and you're never coming back.
I'm giving you a new choice.<eos> You're gonna leave my building.<eos> You're gonna run, and you're never coming back.<eos> They'll find me.<eos> That's why you're gonna give me your password.
Here.<eos> Put this on.<eos> Thanks.<eos> - What's this?<eos> - Those are the files you asked for.
Sure.<eos> I mean, I lost my dental benefits in the last contract negotiations, and that kind of sucked.<eos> I...<eos> I mean, with the plant.<eos> - You saw the video, right?
- It's not really my place to say.<eos> It's okay.<eos> My mother lives on Staten Island.<eos> I think I wanna make a few phone calls.<eos> You said you had this under control, Joy.
You're late.<eos> Sorry, everyone.<eos> I, uh... had a problem with the elevator.<eos> I know some of you aren't happy with me.<eos> And I know what you want me to do.
If your father were here...<eos> But he isn't.<eos> And as far as I can tell, he's nowhere in this company.<eos> And believe me, I've spent most of the day looking.<eos> I know you all want me to back out on this... but my dad once told me,
And believe me, I've spent most of the day looking.<eos> I know you all want me to back out on this... but my dad once told me,<eos> "If something is worth fighting for, you stand and you fight."<eos> So, I'm standing.<eos> Danny, you may have a voice on this board, but it's just a courtesy.
- Danny's plan is...<eos> - The idiotic dream of a child.<eos> Karen Page at The Bulletin seemed to like it.<eos> What?<eos> You already went to the press?
What?<eos> You already went to the press?<eos> She seems to think it's gonna make front page tomorrow.<eos> Listen. I know this isn't what you wanted. Any of you.<eos> But if you look deep down at the better part of yourselves... you'll know we're doing the right thing.
Run it again.<eos> We actually did, sir.<eos> Just... hold on.<eos> Stop the car.<eos> You've refused to sell the Hand's heroin.
Join with us.<eos> We know where the heart of their operation is.<eos> We attack together.<eos> Before they even know what's hit 'em, we can end the Hand's heroin business in one strike.<eos> You can fight.
But the Hand is legion.<eos> Why attack now?<eos> Why do you think you can even the odds against our enemies?<eos> Because I have heard Madame Gao's plans for you.<eos> And if you do nothing, you'll all be dead by the end of the week.
Why attack now?<eos> Why do you think you can even the odds against our enemies?<eos> Because I have heard Madame Gao's plans for you.<eos> And if you do nothing, you'll all be dead by the end of the week.<eos> You don't know me... but the Hand does.
Danny might actually be onto...<eos> What's going on?<eos> The board just held an emergency meeting.<eos> About what?<eos> About how you, your brother, and Danny will no longer be on the board... or any part of this company ever again.
You know what to do.
You know what to do.<eos> Hey, it's Danny.<eos> You need to leave your mom's place right now.<eos> Gao may be sending people to hurt you.<eos> Call me or Colleen as soon as you get this.
That's gonna be one awkward-ass flight.<eos> Look, I don't know, okay?<eos> It's a long way to China.<eos> I'll figure it out before we get there.<eos> If you don't trust me, then don't come.
Cut the theatrics, Lawrence.<eos> Let's get this over with so we can pack our offices.<eos> Oh, your things have already been packed... uh, minus any Rand property, of course.<eos> The boxes will be released to you as soon as you sign your termination agreements.<eos> You're holding our knickknacks hostage?
You're holding our knickknacks hostage?<eos> They're not just stuff, Ward.<eos> I have things that can't be replaced... photos of Mom and Dad.<eos> As I said, your mementos are a pen stroke away.<eos> I think you'll find the severance to be more than generous.
That's exactly what we offered Danny.<eos> Ironic, isn't it?<eos> Enjoy this while you can.<eos> When I'm on the other side of this table, I guarantee you won't be smiling.<eos> You have no one to blame but each other.
The stock will rebound.<eos> He bought a warehouse and a pier for no... discernible reason... and refused to settle the class action suit.<eos> It was becoming a pattern.<eos> This deal is non-negotiable.<eos> And you both have to sign, or you both get nothing.
It was becoming a pattern.<eos> This deal is non-negotiable.<eos> And you both have to sign, or you both get nothing.<eos> Ward... you mind joining us for a second?<eos> I said you both have to sign, or no deal.
Interesting.<eos> Did you have a number in mind?<eos> Thirty million dollars.<eos> I'll sign right now.<eos> You never have to see my face again.
Did you have a number in mind?<eos> Thirty million dollars.<eos> I'll sign right now.<eos> You never have to see my face again.<eos> I realize... that you will have to eat some crow... with the rest of the board.
How does half a million sound?<eos> I don't know what to say, Ward.<eos> How about yes?<eos> Your father would be ashamed if he could see the way his family was falling apart.<eos> All due respect, Lawrence, you don't know shit about my father.
Joy didn't consult me... and she certainly doesn't speak for me.<eos> I'm asking you, as a favor.<eos> It's too late.<eos> It's a shame how things turned out.<eos> Well, you get to be the hero who rights the ship.
It's too late.<eos> It's a shame how things turned out.<eos> Well, you get to be the hero who rights the ship.<eos> No.<eos> I'm talking about you and your sister working against each other.
Maybe we shouldn't stay in one place for too long.<eos> In case they have guards patrolling.<eos> No one's come by yet.<eos> Plus, there's not really a lot of prime surveillance spots around here.<eos> You know what?
Give me your wallet.<eos> Hey, how's it going?<eos> It would be better if my bowl weren't empty.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You speak English?
I need information... about the factory, the guards, and the woman who runs it, Gao.<eos> I can pay.<eos> The only fool... bigger than one seeking information about that witch... is the fool willing to provide it.<eos> I'd rather be a fool than a coward.<eos> If you know how dangerous Gao is, this is your chance to do something about it.
I can pay.<eos> The only fool... bigger than one seeking information about that witch... is the fool willing to provide it.<eos> I'd rather be a fool than a coward.<eos> If you know how dangerous Gao is, this is your chance to do something about it.<eos> Do you really believe you can stop her?
I don't wanna hurt you.<eos> I just want to know what happened between you and my father.<eos> Is that what's driven you to this state?<eos> He tried to shut this place down, didn't he?<eos> So you stopped him.
Is that what's driven you to this state?<eos> He tried to shut this place down, didn't he?<eos> So you stopped him.<eos> A shot in the dark rarely finds its target.<eos> You deny it?
You deny it?<eos> Would you believe me if I did?<eos> Stay right there, boy.<eos> Submit to me without further incident, and your friends will be granted a merciful death.<eos> I'll die before I let you touch them.
Would you believe me if I did?<eos> Stay right there, boy.<eos> Submit to me without further incident, and your friends will be granted a merciful death.<eos> I'll die before I let you touch them.<eos> I'm afraid I can't allow you to do that just yet, Mr. Rand.
And don't let the enemy bait you into a trap.<eos> Let's just take her in.<eos> I'm not turning her over to the police until I find out what I want to know.<eos> The police?<eos> Do you truly believe that's where I will end up?
I'm not turning her over to the police until I find out what I want to know.<eos> The police?<eos> Do you truly believe that's where I will end up?<eos> Tell me about my father and the Hand.<eos> Why are you asking about events that happened 15 years ago when you have more pressing concerns?
It won't change the way you feel about him.<eos> You know she was responsible for your parents' death. Isn't that enough?<eos> Nothing she says will make you feel better about that.<eos> Let's just be done with this.<eos> So now you're ganging up on me?
I'm walkin' here!<eos> Smells good.<eos> It's a...<eos> Uh, what... what is that?<eos> You've never seen pretzels and hot dogs before?
Yeah.<eos> Yeah, much better.<eos> Are you uncomfortable?<eos> What difference would it make?<eos> You will not untie me.
Yeah, much better.<eos> Are you uncomfortable?<eos> What difference would it make?<eos> You will not untie me.<eos> You're right.
You will not untie me.<eos> You're right.<eos> I was just trying to be polite.<eos> I won't make that mistake again.<eos> Regret hovers around everything you do.
I was just trying to be polite.<eos> I won't make that mistake again.<eos> Regret hovers around everything you do.<eos> Am I wrong?<eos> You don't know anything about me.
I won't make that mistake again.<eos> Regret hovers around everything you do.<eos> Am I wrong?<eos> You don't know anything about me.<eos> You often find yourself fraternizing with people with gifts.
Am I wrong?<eos> You don't know anything about me.<eos> You often find yourself fraternizing with people with gifts.<eos> Daredevil, Luke Cage, Danny Rand.<eos> You secretly hope that the thing that makes them special will rub off on you, but it hasn't, and you have failed each of them in different ways.
When they were beaten up and bleeding and looking for help, they came to me.<eos> But where do they all end up?<eos> Ruined.<eos> And the only thing they have in common is you.<eos> First, you wouldn't talk.
But where do they all end up?<eos> Ruined.<eos> And the only thing they have in common is you.<eos> First, you wouldn't talk.<eos> Now, you won't shut up.
Ruined.<eos> And the only thing they have in common is you.<eos> First, you wouldn't talk.<eos> Now, you won't shut up.<eos> You are looking for who you want to be.
You are looking for who you want to be.<eos> Searching for your destiny.<eos> But it's selfish of you to involve Danny in your quest.<eos> He has greater problems to deal with.<eos> If you were going to be special, it would have already happened.
- I swear to God...<eos> - Claire?<eos> Why don't you take a break?<eos> Hello, Ms. Wing.<eos> You don't look well.
- I...<eos> - Never mind.<eos> I don't want to know.<eos> It's exhausting, isn't it?<eos> You know, I'm not above shoving a sweaty sock in your mouth to shut you up.
- Never mind.<eos> I don't want to know.<eos> It's exhausting, isn't it?<eos> You know, I'm not above shoving a sweaty sock in your mouth to shut you up.<eos> I know the burden you carry.
A woman in this world.<eos> You are consistently underestimated.<eos> Last... warning.<eos> Your grandfather was right to train you the way he did.<eos> You didn't know my grandfather.
"The frog trapped in a well... does not understand the sea."<eos> So what?<eos> That's a saying anyone in Japan would know.<eos> It was printed in his obituary.<eos> You could have looked that up.
That's a saying anyone in Japan would know.<eos> It was printed in his obituary.<eos> You could have looked that up.<eos> He spoke it to you many times.<eos> Because you always saw the wider world, understood what was at stake.
You could have looked that up.<eos> He spoke it to you many times.<eos> Because you always saw the wider world, understood what was at stake.<eos> Just as you do now.<eos> If you allow this charade to continue, all will be lost.
He spoke it to you many times.<eos> Because you always saw the wider world, understood what was at stake.<eos> Just as you do now.<eos> If you allow this charade to continue, all will be lost.<eos> Release me and I will allow you to proceed with your life untouched.
If you allow this charade to continue, all will be lost.<eos> Release me and I will allow you to proceed with your life untouched.<eos> I can guarantee that.<eos> They are coming, Ms. Wing.<eos> You know what they'll do when they arrive.
I need to go home.<eos> I was relieved to hear from you, sir.<eos> I'd really been quite worried.<eos> Especially after Ward and Joy lost the company.<eos> You never went this long without contacting me before.
- Thank you, sir.<eos> That wasn't a compliment.<eos> Orders around the front.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> If you don't get out of here, I will bust your head wide open.
- Did you get everything?<eos> If I give her too much, she'll fall asleep.<eos> If I give her too little, she'll resist you.<eos> Not afraid of needles, are you?<eos> You are about to face something you are completely unprepared for.
If I give her too much, she'll fall asleep.<eos> If I give her too little, she'll resist you.<eos> Not afraid of needles, are you?<eos> You are about to face something you are completely unprepared for.<eos> You've got something scarier than a dragon in a cave?
But Harold, now, is a different story.<eos> He was more than willing to partner up.<eos> What?<eos> And when your father found out...<eos> What are you talking about?
- I don't know. - Say it.<eos> We're gonna be okay.<eos> - We're gonna be okay.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You're such children.
These guys are military.<eos> Don't move.<eos> Look to your girlfriend, Danny.<eos> She doesn't have much longer to live.<eos> You escort me to my people, I will give Claire safe passage to help young Colleen.
I will have the antidote ready and waiting outside.<eos> But you must decide now.<eos> She's lying.<eos> Don't do it.<eos> Danny Rand told me that you've had experience with the Hand.
But you must decide now.<eos> She's lying.<eos> Don't do it.<eos> Danny Rand told me that you've had experience with the Hand.<eos> That you understand what they can do.
Don't do it.<eos> Danny Rand told me that you've had experience with the Hand.<eos> That you understand what they can do.<eos> Name your price.<eos> No amount of money will buy the answer you are looking for.
Hey, before you go, come up here.<eos> It's been a long, strange day.<eos> I thought we should celebrate.<eos> I didn't know which was your favorite, so...<eos> - Mr. Meachum, you didn't...
It's just... nothingness.<eos> Kyle?<eos> Jesus!<eos> Oh, what did I do?<eos> What are you doing?
- Already?<eos> This isn't mine.<eos> This is a set up.<eos> Someone set me up!<eos> You cannot search my car without cause.
Someone set me up!<eos> You cannot search my car without cause.<eos> It was on the seat.<eos> Cause.<eos> You think I'm that stupid?
Really?<eos> - Are we really gonna do this?<eos> - What is that?<eos> What are we gonna do?<eos> You sit there, take notes about how screwed up I am, prescribe some meds, send me back to some kind of cell.
- What is that?<eos> What are we gonna do?<eos> You sit there, take notes about how screwed up I am, prescribe some meds, send me back to some kind of cell.<eos> I know how the whole 72-hour-hold business works.<eos> Is that why you think you're here?
I know how the whole 72-hour-hold business works.<eos> Is that why you think you're here?<eos> I'm here because my dad had drugs planted in my car.<eos> Your dad?<eos> Listen... this is way too complicated for you to understand.
Listen... this is way too complicated for you to understand.<eos> Try me.<eos> You see, that's the trap.<eos> And he knows it.<eos> If I start talking about him, then you'll say...
I will take you to him.<eos> End of story.<eos> But you see, Ward, that's a risky proposition for a dual diagnosis patient.<eos> Dual diagnosis?<eos> You're an addict and you have psychological disorders,
She is a fighter.<eos> But once the poison reaches her brain...<eos> There has to be something else we can do.<eos> This is beyond me, Danny.<eos> If she dies, you die.
I've taken care of Madame Gao's mercenaries.<eos> How do we know this isn't another trap?<eos> Look out your window.<eos> Now... please, open the door.<eos> You have no business here.
- Then heal her.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> Danny, we're in trouble here.<eos> What are you waiting for?<eos> You are about to fall into a trap you cannot escape.
- What are you talking about?<eos> Danny, we're in trouble here.<eos> What are you waiting for?<eos> You are about to fall into a trap you cannot escape.<eos> I don't understand what you're asking me to do.
And you and Ward were there every two hours.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, we had to turn you in your bed.<eos> Keep you from getting bedsores.<eos> You were just teenagers.
Yeah.<eos> Yeah, we had to turn you in your bed.<eos> Keep you from getting bedsores.<eos> You were just teenagers.<eos> But you wouldn't let the hospice nurse do it.
To whom?<eos> Joy Meachum.<eos> And she passed the phone off to a Harold.<eos> Harold Meachum?<eos> Are you sure about that name?
Are you sure about that name?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> And they spoke about Madame Gao.<eos> Send the entire transcript to my computer.<eos> And see if you can trace back that call to its exact location.
Kind of.<eos> We have free time.<eos> We all live in the dorms here.<eos> But there's a curfew.<eos> You ever try and sneak out?
Are there any areas off-limits?<eos> Yeah, a few.<eos> Mostly back that way.<eos> I talked to all of 'em already. Clear the east perimeter.<eos> You know the deal.
I talked to all of 'em already. Clear the east perimeter.<eos> You know the deal.<eos> Tray by the door when you're done.<eos> Of course.<eos> I'm guessing you can see me.
You know the deal.<eos> Tray by the door when you're done.<eos> Of course.<eos> I'm guessing you can see me.<eos> Well, I'm glad you're finally getting what you deserve.
Punishment is so juvenile.<eos> And quite boring, I might add.<eos> Not for me.<eos> I'm not surprised.<eos> You're still a child.
You're still a child.<eos> Yeah, well, at least I'm not in prison.<eos> Is that what this is?<eos> I offer you freedom, was willing to let you live whatever life you wanted.<eos> And you rejected that offer, pursued and kidnapped me.
Yeah, well, at least I'm not in prison.<eos> Is that what this is?<eos> I offer you freedom, was willing to let you live whatever life you wanted.<eos> And you rejected that offer, pursued and kidnapped me.<eos> Then you ran towards slavery as fast as you could.

And you rejected that offer, pursued and kidnapped me.<eos> Then you ran towards slavery as fast as you could.<eos> You're an idiot.<eos> Really?<eos> Now you're baiting me with insults?
They are stealing your ability to trust.<eos> That is how they crush you.<eos> Who?<eos> The Hand.<eos> What are you talking about?
She doesn't represent us.<eos> She... she is part of a rogue faction of the Hand that deals drugs and destroys lives,<eos> - but that is not who we are.<eos> - That's your story?<eos> That she's the bad Hand and you're the good Hand?
My name is Bakuto.<eos> I'll be taking over from Madame Gao.<eos> Danny told you about me.<eos> Not directly.<eos> But... you should know by now that our reach is extensive.
Danny told you about me.<eos> Not directly.<eos> But... you should know by now that our reach is extensive.<eos> I guess I was too optimistic to imagine the Hand would let me go.<eos> I think you'll find I'm much more easygoing than Gao.
You see, she leads through fear.<eos> I find partnership to be a much more effective method.<eos> Oh... what are you proposing?<eos> Everything that is Gao's is now mine.<eos> You proceed as you have but with a different goal.
Keep moving! Keep moving.<eos> Did he get away?<eos> You did your best to stop him.<eos> Just like I asked.<eos> You didn't kill him, did you?
This is an emergency, and Rand needs to respond accordingly.<eos> Now, we have been riddled with controversy over the past few weeks.<eos> The Danny situation, the firing of me and my brother... and now we have this.<eos> As soon as the news hits the airwaves, our stock, which is already falling, will plummet even further.<eos> Unless... you see fit to reinstate the visionaries that led Rand to historic profits.
Right the ship.<eos> Show Wall Street and the world that stability is being restored.<eos> Now, there will be whispers about the why of Wilkins' death, but Rand should quiet those fears with a show of strength.<eos> The Meachums will set things right.<eos> Now the truth is... you need us.
Why don't you do something to take your mind off of it? Like, explain to me where the hell you and Colleen went after I saw you get taken away at the dojo by some mystery man.<eos> And why you just showed up at my door, bleeding,<eos> - with a completely different mystery man.<eos> - Davos.<eos> - You mentioned that.
Seriously?<eos> Hey, can we go over this a little later, please?<eos> Come on!<eos> That was two!<eos> You seem to be a very gifted healer.
I'm gonna defeat the Hand, Claire.<eos> Whatever it takes.<eos> It's what the Order of the Crane Mother has trained me for.<eos> And did those monks teach you how to deal with a broken heart?<eos> The way you two feel about each other?
He went up to your roof for his meditations.<eos> He needs to restore his chi so he can summon the Iron Fist for our battle with the Hand.<eos> He told me to watch over you.<eos> Yeah, I bet he did.<eos> Well, as long as you're watching, are you hungry?
Calmed the storm inside me.<eos> - I've seen Danny do that.<eos> - It's how we were trained.<eos> You don't let emotions cloud your actions.<eos> So you just... lock it all away.
A weapon doesn't know feelings.<eos> You know, Danny should be back by now.<eos> Perhaps his chi is more damaged than we thought.<eos> But Master Lei Kung will be able to fix it once Danny returns to K'un-Lun.<eos> Wait, you think he's going back?
But Master Lei Kung will be able to fix it once Danny returns to K'un-Lun.<eos> Wait, you think he's going back?<eos> I'll make him. If I have to.<eos> Uh, it's... just the pizza.<eos> You know what?
The Hand wants something from you.<eos> Rushing in blindly could be it.<eos> I only want one thing... and that's to see the Hand destroyed.<eos> And then you go back to K'un-Lun?<eos> Davos, could you give us a minute?
You know, they may claim to have loftier ideals, but the Hand are just common criminals with good marketing skills.<eos> You take their money and they'll come running.<eos> You two stake out the compound.<eos> Once we close off the accounts, he'll come out into the open.<eos> That's when you can strike.
No.<eos> No more traps.<eos> No more interrogations.<eos> This has to be done the way it should have been from the start.<eos> You're talking about murder.
- Stacy.<eos> That's a nice name.<eos> You... you know who I am, how much I'm worth, right?<eos> - Of course, Mr. Meachum.<eos> I will pay you whatever you earn in a year, if you unstrap me and get me out of here.
But as the Bible says...<eos> - "This too shall pass."<eos> - Please.<eos> Stacy, get me outta here.<eos> I will pay you whatever you want.
- "This too shall pass."<eos> - Please.<eos> Stacy, get me outta here.<eos> I will pay you whatever you want.<eos> Whatever you want.
Oh, relax.<eos> I'm here to help.<eos> There you go.<eos> You've been poisoned by Madame Gao's synthetic heroin.<eos> - You know her?
Oh, shit.<eos> - Though, I'm no friend of Gao's.<eos> - What do you want?<eos> I want to be your friend.<eos> I can get help you get out of here. And most importantly,
I can make sure he never comes back.<eos> From the dead, I mean.<eos> It's a gift that we've given to a very chosen few.<eos> We can see that we made a mistake in giving it to Harold.<eos> You know this, too.
It's corporations like Rand Enterprises that govern the world.<eos> - So you wanna run Rand like Gao.<eos> - No. No, not like Gao.<eos> She's all stick and no carrot.<eos> I want you in charge, because Harold has become...
- He can't be trusted.<eos> Our relationship would be more quid pro quo.<eos> Take this drug I'm giving you now, for instance.<eos> There are countless poor souls that are addicted to Gao's drugs, going through your same withdrawal.<eos> And you're saying you would share this with Rand?
It sounds good, no?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Good. I do have an immediate favor to ask of you.<eos> - And that is?<eos> - Help me capture the Iron Fist, and you and your sister will be safe.
I'm not anymore.<eos> What sort of a relationship do you have with her?<eos> Davos, relax.<eos> This is Colleen Wing.<eos> You're Davos?
- Like a... Like a family vacation.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Hey, I've always wanted to go to Australia.<eos> - Deal.<eos> - You've got a visitor.
No, you're the monster.<eos> Enough.<eos> All of you.<eos> You goddamn idiot.<eos> You're screwing everything up.
None of this was part of the deal.<eos> Do it.<eos> Did you really think taking my money would work?<eos> Oh, what's this deal?<eos> You must really be quite the bitter pill, Harold, because your son is giving me access to Rand in exchange for killing you.
Done.<eos> - Can Joy and I leave now?<eos> Come, sit over here.<eos> You weren't really gonna have Dad killed, right?<eos> You poor people are such a mess.
I know a good family therapist that could help, should any of you survive the night.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> I'm gonna come back for you, Bakuto.<eos> And I'm gonna show you no mercy.<eos> You're not coming back.
I'm gonna come back for you, Bakuto.<eos> And I'm gonna show you no mercy.<eos> You're not coming back.<eos> Once we remove your head from your body, there will be no returning...<eos> - You're not killing my father!
Stay still, Joy.<eos> Don't move.<eos> Everything'll be okay.<eos> Don't do this in front of Joy.<eos> I will get you anything you want. Name it.
You couldn't... because you haven't got it in you, Danny.<eos> You're not a warrior.<eos> - You are a failure.<eos> - It's not that simple!<eos> You of all people don't get a say in this!
You know, you freed me from the Hand.<eos> I can return to my life.<eos> With my children.<eos> All thanks to you.<eos> - You're like family to me.
- Now back to sports.<eos> - Thanks, Thembi.<eos> Well, it was a packed house at the arena last night.<eos> Hometown fans...<eos> Sir? Sir, you can't park there.
Hometown fans...<eos> Sir? Sir, you can't park there.<eos> Why don't you get it washed for me?<eos> So, yes, I know for a fact that the charges against Danny are false.<eos> Last we spoke, you seemed very much on the anti-Danny track.
Unfortunately, I haven't had any contact with him.<eos> Good morning.<eos> May I help you?<eos> Good morning.<eos> So if you want to help him, perhaps you could tell me who would want to set him up in this way?
Ah, Jeri Hogarth.<eos> I see you've aged reasonably well.<eos> Hi, Dad.<eos> It's a long story.<eos> You have been faking your death for all these years?
"J-Money."<eos> I can take you to him.<eos> Look who I found.<eos> As an officer of the court, I'm obliged to tell you to turn yourself in.<eos> You really think that's a good idea?
Look who I found.<eos> As an officer of the court, I'm obliged to tell you to turn yourself in.<eos> You really think that's a good idea?<eos> No, of course not.<eos> You're a billionaire facing federal drug charges.
You really think that's a good idea?<eos> No, of course not.<eos> You're a billionaire facing federal drug charges.<eos> You might as well have the words "Flight Risk" stamped on your forehead.<eos> You surrender, and you will end up in a jail cell for 6 to 12 months minimum before this even goes to trial.
Another fugitive from the law.<eos> The DEA considers both of you armed and dangerous.<eos> They will not hesitate to shoot.<eos> Colleen, you are being charged with assault, obstructing justice and abetting a fugitive.<eos> So you have some problems of your own to focus on.
- Look, it's okay.<eos> Just put her on my tab. Please.<eos> The DEA, this is what they've given me.<eos> These are from the Hand tablet.<eos> What, you've seen these documents before?
These are from the Hand tablet.<eos> What, you've seen these documents before?<eos> They've been changed.<eos> It must've been Harold Meachum.<eos> You know. You know that he's alive then?
- faking his death for all these years.<eos> - He didn't fake it.<eos> He really died.<eos> Let's make a list of things that you are never allowed to say again, starting with that.<eos> Now, if you still have the tablet, I could... I could get it analyzed. Maybe prove that the documents were forged.
Now, if you still have the tablet, I could... I could get it analyzed. Maybe prove that the documents were forged.<eos> I gave it to Harold.<eos> Back when I was stupid enough to think we were on the same side.<eos> Is there anything else we can do?<eos> The way I see it, you have three options.
I gave it to Harold.<eos> Back when I was stupid enough to think we were on the same side.<eos> Is there anything else we can do?<eos> The way I see it, you have three options.<eos> You can... go back to Xanadu, or wherever the hell it is that you were for 15 years, and never look back.

No food?<eos> No water?<eos> I've suffered worse.<eos> There are metal screens on those windows.<eos> You could have escaped.
There are metal screens on those windows.<eos> You could have escaped.<eos> And miss your visit? Heavens no.<eos> I've been looking forward to this.<eos> You're sounding rather anxious, Danny Rand.
I've been looking forward to this.<eos> You're sounding rather anxious, Danny Rand.<eos> I need information.<eos> Why should I tell you anything?<eos> Because if you don't, I'll cut off your head and feed it to the rats.
I need access to everything that was on the tablet I took from you.<eos> I purged all that information from my computers.<eos> - There are no other copies?<eos> - There are not.<eos> You're lying.
I have never lied to him.<eos> Can you say the same?<eos> Tell me what I need to know.<eos> It's no mystery why you're such a poor Iron Fist.<eos> You don't understand your own path.
Can you say the same?<eos> Tell me what I need to know.<eos> It's no mystery why you're such a poor Iron Fist.<eos> You don't understand your own path.<eos> Your chi is so polluted with guilt, yet you refuse to face it.
Your chi is so polluted with guilt, yet you refuse to face it.<eos> - And what should I be guilty of?<eos> - The death of your parents.<eos> That makes no sense.<eos> You watched them both die, yet somehow, you survived with barely a scratch.
- And what should I be guilty of?<eos> - The death of your parents.<eos> That makes no sense.<eos> You watched them both die, yet somehow, you survived with barely a scratch.<eos> How many nights did you lie awake, asking yourself, "Why did I live?"
"Child touched by fire." Isn't that how it goes?<eos> And now that child has grown up.<eos> And guilt is such an uncomfortable feeling, isn't it?<eos> Much easier to burn it in the flames of anger.<eos> You think you're so clever... with these little mind games.
Much easier to burn it in the flames of anger.<eos> You think you're so clever... with these little mind games.<eos> And that's the real reason why you left K'un-Lun, isn't it?<eos> Your thirst for vengeance.<eos> You wanted someone to pay for the death of your mother and father.
And that's the real reason why you left K'un-Lun, isn't it?<eos> Your thirst for vengeance.<eos> You wanted someone to pay for the death of your mother and father.<eos> I didn't even know it was murder until after I left.<eos> You were only ten years old, but you were smart enough to know that airplanes don't drop from the sky for no reason.
You wanted someone to pay for the death of your mother and father.<eos> I didn't even know it was murder until after I left.<eos> You were only ten years old, but you were smart enough to know that airplanes don't drop from the sky for no reason.<eos> We're wasting our time here.<eos> If what you're saying is true... then why haven't I killed you already?

- The Meachums, but...<eos> - But what?<eos> Harold was my father's best friend. He would never...<eos> He seems to have no problem hurting you now.<eos> You were in the plane as well.
He set up our heroin operation in China.<eos> But when your father was about to discover all this, Harold feared that he would ruin everything.<eos> I still remember the moment when he came to me and asked for poison.<eos> He seemed very enthused by the idea.<eos> You will only gain the strength of a real Iron Fist after you have killed Harold. You must rid yourself of this anger.
- I can't let him do this alone.<eos> - Colleen!<eos> - Claire, we stick to the plan.<eos> - Just get... Just get the tablet!<eos> Tell me you're not gonna try to kill Harold!
Go get her.<eos> I'll go around the back.<eos> Stop right there, ma'am.<eos> Stop!<eos> You looking for me?
Joy.<eos> - Stop!<eos> You know the truth, Harold!<eos> It's time to face it!<eos> You will only gain the strength of a real Iron Fist after you have killed Harold.
- Stop!<eos> You know the truth, Harold!<eos> It's time to face it!<eos> You will only gain the strength of a real Iron Fist after you have killed Harold.<eos> You must rid yourself of this anger.
Yeah, look...<eos> I'm saying this as a friend... but you two share a lot in common.<eos> No, that's... not a good thing.<eos> Your first instinct to a problem is to respond with violence.<eos> I guess what I'm saying here is... you're both pretty effed up and need some serious psychological help.
I'll miss you... while you're gone.<eos> Well, I was...<eos> I was kind of hoping that... you'd come with me.<eos> Good morning, sir.<eos> Even though Danny Rand physically survived the plane crash, it seems the boy you knew died that day.
Maybe.<eos> He destroys everything he touches.<eos> Isn't it true your world fell apart after his return?<eos> Things changed for me.<eos> And you know that if you have any hope of returning to your old life, he must be removed.
Hold on!<eos> Was that there just by coincidence?<eos> Or does this mean...?<eos> Pastor Nick?<eos> Whatever you do you must keep that Titan out of the sunlight!
We just fought a Titan here.<eos> Why are they keeping us in the dark?<eos> Business as usual.<eos> But what's scummiest of all is that there's no "official" reason why all these people died.<eos> Now then, it's time for you to talk.
To take back our freedom from the Titans!<eos> I was willing to sacrifice my own life for that cause!<eos> I'm not asking you to talk, I'm ordering you.<eos> Is that clear?<eos> And if you won't talk, I'll try the next person.
Everyone here?<eos> Nanaba?<eos> Multiple Titans, 500 meters to the south.<eos> They're coming right this way.<eos> There's no time for you to gear up.
So?<eos> I was going to help you sneak there anyway, remember?<eos> You coming, Bertholdt?<eos> Of course I'll come.<eos> As you may know, today marks the new darkest day in humanity's history!
As you may know, today marks the new darkest day in humanity's history!<eos> If ever humankind needed to give its all, that time is now!<eos> The Titans have reached the woods!<eos> Scatter!<eos> Ride as fast as you can!
That thing on your waist that flies around.<eos> I'm certain we speak the same language.<eos> Perhaps you're simply too frightened.<eos> Oh, I see you use swords, too.<eos> I guess that means you know we reside in the nape.
I guess that means you know we reside in the nape.<eos> Ah, well, I'll just take it back with me.<eos> Only when a person stops fighting do they lose.<eos> As long as we continue to fight we are not beaten!<eos> You can move now.
The first dream Friday featured Ty lafitte, the inventor of trueyou and our founding father.<eos> And usually, we feature one of our engineers or our visionaries, but today, unfortunately, it's just me, and for that, I apologize in advance.<eos> - We love you, eamon!<eos> - Thanks, morn.<eos> Now, you might not have seen me around campus for the last few days, and maybe you're wondering just where the heck I've been.
And here's my backyard.<eos> Here's traffic on the 101.<eos> Oh, did you think this was just a camera?<eos> No. Welcome to real-time analytic processing.<eos> When you see this, you're also getting this.
Air quality, traffic volume, weather patterns, biometrics, facial recognition, saved and searchable, all to serve you better.<eos> My friends, we are looking at retailing these in just a few months for less than a pair of jeans.<eos> And I'm not talking about fancy jeans.<eos> I'm talking about the ones like I'm wearing.<eos> Now, circlers, do you like to share?
And I'm not talking about fancy jeans.<eos> I'm talking about the ones like I'm wearing.<eos> Now, circlers, do you like to share?<eos> Sharing is caring!<eos> Sharing is caring. I thought you might say that.
Smile!" You know, and now...<eos> Now it's everyone. I can't help it if you're not... social.<eos> I am social enough.<eos> I mean, isn't... This socializing?<eos> I assume you've heard about that senator that's trying to, like, break you guys up, citing antitrust laws, right?
We need to know what the people who represent us are doing with their time on our dime to serve us better.<eos> Well, I'm happy to report there is a woman who is taking all of this very seriously, and is taking some pretty dramatic steps to address the problem.<eos> So, please join me in welcoming Olivia Santos, congresswoman for district 14.<eos> that's right, tom.<eos> I am as concerned as you are about the need for citizens to know what their elected leaders are doing!
- Death threats, Mae.<eos> Obviously, I never meant for this to happen, but I...<eos> Will you listen to me?<eos> I can't do this.<eos> I can't be a part of this world that you're creating.
I can't believe i was so stupid.<eos> I'm so lucky you guys were around here.<eos> Luck?<eos> Hell, seechange cameras saved your life.<eos> The cop saw you go through the fence, and then we got a call from someone watching seals.
It sounds incredible.<eos> But there's no record of any of it.<eos> - Not outside my own memory. - Hmm.<eos> So, now here we get into something personal.<eos> As you know, i have a son, Gunnar, who was born with cerebral palsy.
Hey, where are you guys?<eos> - Keep going.<eos> - Urn! Shit.<eos> I hope the engineers are watching, because that definitely shouldn't have happened, and it definitely won't happen again.<eos> You can trust me there.
- Urn! Shit.<eos> I hope the engineers are watching, because that definitely shouldn't have happened, and it definitely won't happen again.<eos> You can trust me there.<eos> this is me brushing my teeth.<eos> If you're enjoying this, I'm worried about you.
And here's how many Americans are registered in the circle.<eos> And there's that guy.<eos> So, now we get down to the meat of today's session, something we've discussed with congresswoman Santos and others-- what if your circle profile automatically registered you to vote?<eos> With trueyou, in order to set up the profile, you have to be a real person with a real address, the complete personal info, real social security number, with all the information that the government wants<eos> when you register to vote. So, why wouldn't the state consider you already registered when you open a circle account?
They all starved.<eos> She was sent to prison in england, but escaped with the help of a guard who she apparently seduced.<eos> Over a billion people are watching.<eos> Let's see how many are in the uk.<eos> Do you all think 14 million brits and a billion global participants worldwide can find Fiona highbridge in under 20 minutes'?
- I think he's in there.<eos> - All right, just go around.<eos> Mercer, come out!<eos> Remember to be nice, okay?<eos> Mercer, we know you're in there. You found where he is. You did it.
And I couldn't agree with you more.<eos> I know that tom, he agrees too, right, tom?<eos> You want to come out?<eos> Come on.<eos> There you are.
So, I want to invite eamon and torn to join me in this experiment that they have pioneered.<eos> I invite them to set an example for the circle and the world...<eos> To go transparent.<eos> What do you say, guys?<eos> Will you join me?
and their private accounts, and their secondary confidential accounts, and even their super-secret scrambled code accounts that nobody, not even their assistants or wives, knew existed...<eos> Until now.<eos> It's all been sent to you already.<eos> We're so fucked.<eos> I think we're entitled to that kind of access, don't you?
Hey, good timing.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm tired of hiding.<eos> These passwords and secret knocks, the difference between public and private...<eos> Aren't you all?
The new one, recommended by that snake Rainaldi, is a cut-throat, I am sure."<eos> Who's Rainaldi?<eos> No clue.<eos> May I see?<eos> Was he drunk, do you think?
Please, come in.<eos> I'm nearly finished.<eos> - Where is he?<eos> - Where is he?<eos> Surely, my dear fellow, you know... he's dead.
She wants this place let.<eos> Even sold.<eos> Your cousin Rachel, Mr. Ashley, is a woman of very strong... impulse and passion.<eos> Very strong.<eos> Do you understand?
My name is Rainaldi.<eos> I am your cousin's lawyer and advisor, and I hope friend.<eos> A copy of the certificate of death.<eos> A copy has already been sent to you in England and another one to the trustee of Ambrose's will, your godfather, Signor Kendall.<eos> - You know all about me.
Really?<eos> Churches, paintings and so on.<eos> - But, then again...<eos> - What?<eos> Oh, you strike me as someone perhaps more interested in beer and foxes than the Rinascimento.
- But, then again...<eos> - What?<eos> Oh, you strike me as someone perhaps more interested in beer and foxes than the Rinascimento.<eos> And why not?<eos> I believe nothing of what you've told me.
There's no mention anywhere of any claim on the part of Mrs. Ashley.<eos> I'm amazed. Why?<eos> We know perfectly well she drove him to his death.<eos> We know nothing of the sort.<eos> If that's the way you're going to talk about your cousin's widow, then frankly, I don't want to listen.
I'm amazed. Why?<eos> We know perfectly well she drove him to his death.<eos> We know nothing of the sort.<eos> If that's the way you're going to talk about your cousin's widow, then frankly, I don't want to listen.<eos> You have been extremely fortunate.
Have hysterics... isn't that what one expects of Italians?<eos> Well, she's only half Italian.<eos> She'll probably be too fat to get up the stairs.<eos> I want justice for Ambrose.<eos> I think you're nervous.
- What do you mean?<eos> I mean, to be here?<eos> What time are you expecting her?<eos> I think I can manage.<eos> You really are nervous, aren't you?
Does she have a wooden leg?<eos> A mustache?<eos> Has she got a wart on her nose?<eos> I don't know anything about that, sir.<eos> The madam has sent word that should you wish to pay your compliments, when you have dined, she would be pleased to receive you, sir.
That's it, Seecombe, thank you.<eos> Come in.<eos> Ambrose...<eos> I am very sorry.<eos> I didn't expect you to be quite so like your cousin.
I am very sorry.<eos> I didn't expect you to be quite so like your cousin.<eos> Won't you sit down for a moment?<eos> Would you like some tea?<eos> Very well, if you wish.
Won't you sit down for a moment?<eos> Would you like some tea?<eos> Very well, if you wish.<eos> Is this a smart thing to do?<eos> Where you come from?
Where you come from?<eos> It's just a cup of tea.<eos> I'm surprised they knew how to do this.<eos> Oh, the... the butter's, erm, melting.<eos> You've got...
I'm surprised they knew how to do this.<eos> Oh, the... the butter's, erm, melting.<eos> You've got...<eos> You'd better lick your fingers.<eos> Smoke if you'd like.
Thank heavens.<eos> She died on her wedding night. Oh, god.<eos> Of what?<eos> Of shock, I think.<eos> I think you just made that up.
I've done it so many times in my imagination.<eos> The clock struck the hour as we drove up.<eos> I even seemed to recognize the sound of the bell.<eos> There...<eos> - You're tired.
I even seemed to recognize the sound of the bell.<eos> There...<eos> - You're tired.<eos> - I'm not tired.<eos> - You're half-asleep. - No, I'm not tired.
- You're tired.<eos> - I'm not tired.<eos> - You're half-asleep. - No, I'm not tired.<eos> I'm really not.<eos> Will you please stop being so polite and get up and go to bed.
- The beautiful flowers!<eos> - You're very welcome!<eos> Thank you!<eos> Thank you!<eos> You had better hurry up and marry your Louise before she gets snapped up by someone else.
Her father seems to have other ideas.<eos> Why does everyone always assume that Louise and I will many?<eos> Lift your feet.<eos> Sorry.<eos> She finds you very beautiful.
As do the Pascoe girls.<eos> How terribly flattering.<eos> The vicar does not agree.<eos> Oh, dear.<eos> - But he finds you feminine.
Good night, Philip.<eos> Idiot.<eos> Idiot, idiot.<eos> What shall we give her?<eos> Think of a figure that you consider fair and reasonable.
- It is.<eos> - Double it.<eos> If we're going to do this, we have to do it properly.<eos> How Ambrose would have done it.<eos> As you wish.
Did he give you coffee?<eos> Glad to see you've cheered up.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Yesterday.<eos> You seemed all down in the dumps.
Glad to see you've cheered up.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Yesterday.<eos> You seemed all down in the dumps.<eos> I'm amazed you noticed.
- Where is she?<eos> - In the kitchen.<eos> - Doing what?<eos> - Hard to tell.<eos> I do hope you don't mind.
It's good for you.<eos> It's good for the health.<eos> Where have you been?<eos> Out and about.<eos> You made him write this!
You made him write this!<eos> What?<eos> What do you...<eos> I did nothing of the sort.<eos> If you had set out to humiliate me, Philip, you really couldn't have got off to a better start!
If you had set out to humiliate me, Philip, you really couldn't have got off to a better start!<eos> - Why?<eos> - Why?<eos> Because now it looks as if I came begging to you!<eos> But you haven't. You didn't.
- Well, what if it wasn't?<eos> Is there something so terribly shameful about that?<eos> Yes!<eos> Yes!<eos> You're Ambrose's wife.
I simply...<eos> I simply will not permit it.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> God!<eos> You'd better take something up to her.
I've never seen a woman cry.<eos> I shall accept the allowance... gratefully, but I should leave.<eos> - To go where?<eos> - It doesn't matter where.<eos> I thought you liked being here.
- Don't be a fool.<eos> If Ambrose hadn't been such an idiot, this place would have been your home.<eos> I think I'm the idiot.<eos> I thought coming here would bring him back to life.<eos> I don't know why you came.
I think I'm the idiot.<eos> I thought coming here would bring him back to life.<eos> I don't know why you came.<eos> I don't know anything about you.<eos> All I know is that I like it now you're here... and I don't want you to go.
I don't know anything about you.<eos> All I know is that I like it now you're here... and I don't want you to go.<eos> Is that complicated?<eos> Very.<eos> If you want to go, then go.
It'll cause a lot of talk, but...<eos> Well, I would have thought it would cause a lot more talk if I stayed.<eos> I'll have to talk to your godfather.<eos> It's no concern of his.<eos> There is only one issue and that's whether you want to stay or not.
I'll have to talk to your godfather.<eos> It's no concern of his.<eos> There is only one issue and that's whether you want to stay or not.<eos> How can you ask me that?<eos> You know the answer to that.
- I'll stay.<eos> Yes, for a little while.<eos> - Then I'll say good night.<eos> - Good night.<eos> - And I hope you'll sleep.
- We can drop it off on our way.<eos> - Very good, sir.<eos> Hurry up.<eos> This is a tisana made with fennel and rose hips.<eos> All together... it's going to make you better.
- Very good, sir.<eos> Hurry up.<eos> This is a tisana made with fennel and rose hips.<eos> All together... it's going to make you better.<eos> They'll think you're a witch.
Why should women suffer in childbirth?<eos> Is it simply their destiny to do so?<eos> I've never thought about it.<eos> No, of course you haven't.<eos> You know nothing about women.
Nothing.<eos> Then what is it, Philip?<eos> Please tell me.<eos> Please.<eos> You need to read inside the envelope itself.
You need to read inside the envelope itself.<eos> "She has done for me at last.<eos> Rachel, my torment.<eos> Please come quickly."<eos> How you have hated me.
Please come quickly."<eos> How you have hated me.<eos> Yes.<eos> That's no use.<eos> You're not the woman I hated.
How you have hated me.<eos> Yes.<eos> That's no use.<eos> You're not the woman I hated.<eos> If you don't want them, Philip, do you think we might let the people who live on the estate, who loved him, have his clothes?
Well... I want it now.<eos> Is that prudent?<eos> What if it should be lost or mislaid?<eos> It won't be lost, Mr. Couch.<eos> And if you're worried about what my godfather might say, please rest assured that he wholly approves.
And if you're worried about what my godfather might say, please rest assured that he wholly approves.<eos> Nevertheless, as your family lawyer for all these years, I would have preferred Mr. Kendall to have been present.<eos> As I say, he's away.<eos> - John.<eos> - Sir? Take this to the mistress, if you will.
To who?<eos> Nonsense.<eos> No, no.<eos> She's just generous.<eos> Tonight, for example, you saw...
A gift for every family in the room.<eos> That won't account for an overdraft of this magnitude.<eos> Then there's all this... The fabrics, the curtains...<eos> Again, I hardly think shop...<eos> Shh. You simply just must increase the allowance.
They were notorious, both him and her, for unbridled extravagance and apparently...<eos> limitless... appetite.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Do you?<eos> I never thought you'd fall so low as to listen to gossip of that sort.
limitless... appetite.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Do you?<eos> I never thought you'd fall so low as to listen to gossip of that sort.<eos> You had no right to take that necklace.
Do you?<eos> I never thought you'd fall so low as to listen to gossip of that sort.<eos> You had no right to take that necklace.<eos> It's mine and it's from the estate.<eos> The estate is not yet yours, as you well know.
I must ask you to desire her to return the collar.<eos> Really?<eos> Well, that's the last thing in the world I intend to do.<eos> Then I must do it for you.<eos> And I'll be damned if you will.
It was quite right that you ask for their return.<eos> - No.<eos> - Please, Philip.<eos> It was a great honor to wear them on such a special evening.<eos> Thank you. I want you to wear them every night.
Find out what has been recovered from the geisha.<eos> Major!<eos> I told you not jump off.<eos> I had to, or more would have died.<eos> You're a member of my team, and my responsibility
I had to, or more would have died.<eos> You're a member of my team, and my responsibility<eos> I will find him and I will kill him.<eos> It's what I am built for, isn't it?<eos> You are more than just a weapon.
You're a member of my team, and my responsibility<eos> I will find him and I will kill him.<eos> It's what I am built for, isn't it?<eos> You are more than just a weapon.<eos> You have a soul, a ghost.
What was going on with you at the hotel last night?<eos> - Nothing, I'm fine.<eos> - You sure?<eos> - Hey, sweetheart, want an upgrade?<eos> - Move. - I have anything you want.
- Hey, Batou!<eos> - Got your bones.<eos> - Thanks man.<eos> - What are they for? - For the dogs.<eos> For someone who doesn't like people how come you care about dogs so much?
- Thanks man.<eos> - What are they for? - For the dogs.<eos> For someone who doesn't like people how come you care about dogs so much?<eos> Don't know. I like just strays and they like me.<eos> They like you 'cause you feed them.
Major, Gabriel.<eos> I used to have a dog.<eos> Seriously?<eos> I had you down, as more of a cat person.<eos> You don't talk about that stuff.
It's the fastest way to find Kuze.<eos> It's too dangerous.<eos> And highly irresponsible.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> You see any bad code headed my way, pull me out.
Copy that.<eos> We got it covered.<eos> There's a lot of heat in here for a nightclub.<eos> It's a Yakuza club.<eos> What did you expect?
No signals going in or out.<eos> Major, I'm in position.<eos> Do you copy?<eos> Beer.<eos> If you don't answer, you're gonna hurt my feelings.
Major, I'm in position.<eos> Do you copy?<eos> Beer.<eos> If you don't answer, you're gonna hurt my feelings.<eos> Ladriya, do you have Major on Comms?
Ladriya, do you have Major on Comms?<eos> Got nothing.<eos> Signal's still blocked.<eos> I'm afraid I get bored rather easily, so...<eos> You don't wanna talk...
Got nothing.<eos> Signal's still blocked.<eos> I'm afraid I get bored rather easily, so...<eos> You don't wanna talk...<eos> Maybe you wanna dance!
You don't wanna talk...<eos> Maybe you wanna dance!<eos> Major, come on.<eos> Answer me.<eos> I thought you said no trouble.
Collaborate with Hanka Robotics and be destroyed.<eos> Major?<eos> Where's Batou?<eos> In enhancement, next door.<eos> He's doing well you took most of the blast.
He's doing well you took most of the blast.<eos> I saw him down there.<eos> It was like... He waited to see me.<eos> We synaptic scanned you.<eos> Everything you witnessed went to Section 9 to evaluate.
I saw him down there.<eos> It was like... He waited to see me.<eos> We synaptic scanned you.<eos> Everything you witnessed went to Section 9 to evaluate.<eos> You know, the scan... also turned up the number of glitches.
Since the deep dive.<eos> Do any of the glitches mean something to you?<eos> No.<eos> They don't.<eos> You've been inside the same shell as he has.
That could have very serious consequences.<eos> You were not authorized to deep dive the geisha.<eos> You're disappointed.<eos> No, I'm worried.<eos> You're not invulnerable.
I can repair your body, but I can't protect your mind.<eos> Why not?<eos> You can see all my thoughts so... You should be able to secure them.<eos> Try and understand your importance Mira.<eos> You're what everyone will become one day.
You can see all my thoughts so... You should be able to secure them.<eos> Try and understand your importance Mira.<eos> You're what everyone will become one day.<eos> You don't know how alone that makes me feel.<eos> I can see you out there, you know.
I can see you out there, you know.<eos> How many fingers am I holding up?<eos> Funny.<eos> Say something nice.<eos> You chose those?
- They suit you.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> I got night vision,...* and X-ray.<eos> I guess I see like you now.<eos> Don't worry, you'll get used to it.
I got night vision,...* and X-ray.<eos> I guess I see like you now.<eos> Don't worry, you'll get used to it.<eos> Thanks for saving my ass.<eos> Glad to see you're okay.
Can you take that off?<eos> So I can see your face?<eos> What does that feel like?<eos> It feels... different.<eos> What are you?
Tell me what they took from me.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> They never told us.<eos> It feels weird driving with these eyes.<eos> Why do you take that?
It feels weird driving with these eyes.<eos> Why do you take that?<eos> Keeps my brain from rejecting this body.<eos> Major, Batou, you need to get here.<eos> What've you got?
Now!<eos> She's in transit.<eos> Her comms are down.<eos> I'm looking at her and I'mm thinking:<eos> "You want me to pay for violin too?"
I do. She's amazing.<eos> But when she practices that thing, it is painful, right?<eos> Why not piano?<eos> I mean, it's the same price, and doesn't sound so bad.<eos> At least if you can't play that proper, it sounds... 2-5-7-1!
I have been through this.<eos> You have the wrong guy.<eos> So tell us who we do have.<eos> My name is Lee Cunningham.<eos> - Where'd you get the weapons?
Isn't she a little angel?<eos> - This is your daughter?<eos> - Right.<eos> Do you have kids?<eos> Where do you live?
I can't remember.<eos> I think it's a tall place.<eos> Is it a tall building?<eos> It's a tall place, right?<eos> You don't have a child.
I think it's a tall place.<eos> Is it a tall building?<eos> It's a tall place, right?<eos> You don't have a child.<eos> You don't have a wife.
Is it a tall building?<eos> It's a tall place, right?<eos> You don't have a child.<eos> You don't have a wife.<eos> You live alone, just you.
- What?<eos> No.<eos> - We went to your apartment.<eos> There was nobody there. - No.<eos> You live there for 10 years by yourself.
Can you get the lock on him?<eos> We gotta move fast.<eos> We're losing him.<eos> Connecting.<eos> Who are you?
Who are you?<eos> Come here.<eos> I'm shy.*<eos> I'm not beautiful... like you.<eos> Tell me who you are.
Come in.<eos> I know why we couldn't find him.<eos> He's using human minds to create a network of his own.<eos> We're coming to your position.<eos> Tell me who you are.
Tell me who you are.<eos> I'm that which you seek to destroy.<eos> In this life, my name is...<eos> Kuze.<eos> What are you doing to me?
Kuze.<eos> What are you doing to me?<eos> I have, connected you, to a network of my own creation.<eos> W-w-when I'm finished in this world... my ghost can survive there and regenerate.<eos> What do you want from me?
I have, connected you, to a network of my own creation.<eos> W-w-when I'm finished in this world... my ghost can survive there and regenerate.<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> I became... fascinated with you.<eos> Reading y-y-your code... when you were inside that geisha.
We are the same.<eos> We're not the same.<eos> You kill innocent people.<eos> Innocent?<eos> Is that what you call them?
Is that what you call them?<eos> I am as they made me.<eos> Who made you?<eos> What have they told you?<eos> That you were the first?
What have they told you?<eos> That you were the first?<eos> The first cerebral salvage.<eos> You were born of lessons they took from my failure.<eos> What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?<eos> I was conscious while they dismembered my body, and discarded me like garbage.<eos> I was lying on a table, listening to doctors talk about how my mind had not meshed with the shell, that they had built;<eos> how project t-two, five, seven, one had failed, and they had to move on... to you.<eos> What a beauty you are!
They have improved s-so much, since they made me.<eos> They thought that we would be a part of their evolution.<eos> But they have created us, to evolve alone... beyond them.<eos> Evolution?<eos> That's what you call... killing everyone who made you?
They thought that we would be a part of their evolution.<eos> But they have created us, to evolve alone... beyond them.<eos> Evolution?<eos> That's what you call... killing everyone who made you?<eos> You're not listening to me.
But they have created us, to evolve alone... beyond them.<eos> Evolution?<eos> That's what you call... killing everyone who made you?<eos> You're not listening to me.<eos> You're a murderer.
It is self-defense.<eos> Defense of self!<eos> More will die... until they tell me what they took.<eos> I won't let that happen.<eos> You want to kill me?
They use it to suppress your memories.<eos> Your shell belongs to them, but not your ghost.<eos> Your ghost is yours.<eos> Remember that.<eos> And maybe you can remember it all.
Get down on the ground now.<eos> Major!<eos> Major!<eos> Oh, Mira!<eos> My got, you are safe!
Major!<eos> Oh, Mira!<eos> My got, you are safe!<eos> You have been gone for hours.<eos> And no one knew where you were.
Oh, Mira!<eos> My got, you are safe!<eos> You have been gone for hours.<eos> And no one knew where you were.<eos> You are scaring me.
How many?<eos> ...Dozens.<eos> How many?<eos> 98 unsuccessful attempts, before you.<eos> You killed 98 innocent people?
How many?<eos> 98 unsuccessful attempts, before you.<eos> You killed 98 innocent people?<eos> No, I didn't kill anyone.<eos> You wouldn't be here.
98 unsuccessful attempts, before you.<eos> You killed 98 innocent people?<eos> No, I didn't kill anyone.<eos> You wouldn't be here.<eos> You wouldn't exist if it weren't for those experiments.
Cutter wanted to motivate you.<eos> To fight terrorists.<eos> I didn't approve.<eos> It was cruel, but my work, that was important, and... you were born.<eos> You were so beautiful.
Silent.<eos> Copy that, sir.<eos> I know where to find her.<eos> I didn't ask you to come here.<eos> You never ask.
But I always do.<eos> Did they send you to bring me in?<eos> I'm just here to fish.<eos> Did you see any?<eos> You're a company man, you follow orders.
Did you see any?<eos> You're a company man, you follow orders.<eos> So, if they ordered you to kill me.<eos> Stop saying shit like that.<eos> You're gonna piss me off.
No voices.<eos> No data streaming.<eos> Just... nothing.<eos> - It scares me.<eos> - Then why do you do it?
Just... nothing.<eos> - It scares me.<eos> - Then why do you do it?<eos> It feels real.<eos> Why didn't you stop him?
- Then why do you do it?<eos> It feels real.<eos> Why didn't you stop him?<eos> I dunno who to trust anymore.<eos> You trust me, right?
Everything was data, they installed in my mind.<eos> And there were others;<eos> run-aways like me.<eos> That's why he's coming... for Hanka.<eos> Can you prove this?
That's why he's coming... for Hanka.<eos> Can you prove this?<eos> Dr. Ouelet can.<eos> Ouelet's dead.<eos> Cutter says you killed her.
It's Cutter, he found us!<eos> Target acquired<eos> No!<eos> Target eliminated.<eos> You came close... you freak.
What are you waiting for?<eos> DO IT!<eos> No!<eos> Keep firing.<eos> Saito, have you found Major?
Hey!<eos> Hey.<eos> Say something nice.<eos> What's your name?<eos> Aramaki told me you had a name from before.
It's unwise to resist.<eos> Please.<eos> Major?<eos> I'm with Cutter.<eos> Do you wanna say anything before I kill him?
It's what I was built for.<eos> So do you give consent?<eos> My name's Major.<eos> And I give my consent.<eos> You don't have to come here anymore.
You know how I came up with the idea for the Triple-X program?
Got so bad, rich suburbanites couldn't afford to fill their swimming pools.<eos> That's when the light clicked on.<eos> Some kid figured out he could skate those empty pools and get some real nasty air.<eos> Dogtown and Z-Boys.<eos> You ever seen it?
Things the world thought were impossible.<eos> Now, that kid needed that drought.<eos> The world needed those empty pools.<eos> That's why Triple-X.<eos> Do you feel safer today than you felt yesterday?
But we, my friend, are not at war.<eos> We are at peril.<eos> That's why Triple-X.<eos> What's the matter?<eos> You on a diet?
We are at peril.<eos> That's why Triple-X.<eos> What's the matter?<eos> You on a diet?<eos> You ain't hungry?
You on a diet?<eos> You ain't hungry?<eos> So? It's lunch or dinnertime somewhere in the world.<eos> Come on, eat up!<eos> You know who does feel safe?
And us, we the people, ended up losing both.<eos> That's why Triple-X. While everybody else is stuck on the ground, we're doing shit on the board nobody's ever even seen before.<eos> Well, that's my pitch.<eos> I always was a better spy than a salesman.<eos> So, what do you say?
Give me the money!<eos> Don't move!<eos> Hurry up!<eos> Goal!<eos> And you say you're no hero.
Hurry up!<eos> Goal!<eos> And you say you're no hero.<eos> I got to call bullshit on that!<eos> You're exactly the kind of hero the world needs.
And you say you're no hero.<eos> I got to call bullshit on that!<eos> You're exactly the kind of hero the world needs.<eos> At the end of the day, it comes down to the same question I've been asking my wife every Friday night for the last 20 years.<eos> Do you want some of this?
I got to call bullshit on that!<eos> You're exactly the kind of hero the world needs.<eos> At the end of the day, it comes down to the same question I've been asking my wife every Friday night for the last 20 years.<eos> Do you want some of this?<eos> Or are you just gonna...
With the push of a button, it can eavesdrop on secure communications,<eos> corrupt military software, transmit false intelligence, or crash a satellite out of the sky like a goddamn tactical warhead.<eos> One of you is behind this.<eos> And I am not leaving here until I find out who.<eos> You fight me with a book?
Here you go, brother.<eos> Chapter one!<eos> Page one!<eos> Shit happens.<eos> You're late!
We need someone who can walk into a tornado, and come out the other side like it was a damn gentle breeze.<eos> You know someone like that?<eos> No.<eos> But Gibbons did.<eos> What you doing?
Down! Get down! Don't move, asshole!<eos> On your knees now, you son of a bitch! Okay, okay.<eos> I want to comply.<eos> I really wanna comply.<eos> But you're confusing me.
I really wanna comply.<eos> But you're confusing me.<eos> "Don't move, you asshole."<eos> "On your knees, you son of a bitch." Which is it?<eos> You have three seconds to comply!
But you're confusing me.<eos> "Don't move, you asshole."<eos> "On your knees, you son of a bitch." Which is it?<eos> You have three seconds to comply!<eos> You're not good at this.
Gibbons!<eos> Gibbons?<eos> Olly-Olly-oxen-free.<eos> Wow.<eos> You really do look different, Gibbons.
Gibbons?<eos> Olly-Olly-oxen-free.<eos> Wow.<eos> You really do look different, Gibbons.<eos> Did you lose weight?
Wow.<eos> You really do look different, Gibbons.<eos> Did you lose weight?<eos> Augustus always had such, well, not exactly nice things to say about you.<eos> When did you realize it was all fake?
You mean the clown show?<eos> You had a guy over there wearing $1,000 Beats when you can buy the knockoff for half the price.<eos> Or the lady that was running to catch a bus that doesn't leave for two hours.<eos> Or the security guard over there buying a soda with foreign currency?<eos> Oh, you know what the kicker was?
Or the lady that was running to catch a bus that doesn't leave for two hours.<eos> Or the security guard over there buying a soda with foreign currency?<eos> Oh, you know what the kicker was?<eos> Clarence from It's a Wonderful Life.<eos> The nice old man that you had sit down next to me with the bag of bombs?
Oh, trust me, he's not laughing.<eos> Nor will he ever again, for that matter.<eos> I've never seen anything like it.<eos> This group is lethal, and they don't care who or what gets in their way.<eos> I was hoping you'd be interested in headlining the next fight card.
Not even a match on a speeding ticket.<eos> They're ghosts, in a day and age where that kind of thing is almost impossible.<eos> Okay, you get that I don't work for suits.<eos> What makes you think I'm gonna want to ruin all their fun?<eos> Well, if you won't do it for me, do it for Gibbons.
The last time I was patriotic, I got three strikes.<eos> And there was only one man who believed in the underdog.<eos> Patriotism is dead.<eos> There's only rebels and tyrants now.<eos> So, which are you?
There's only rebels and tyrants now.<eos> So, which are you?<eos> I'm Triple-X.<eos> Well, welcome back, Triple-X.<eos> Uh, where are you going?
What's in London?<eos> A ghost hunter.<eos> And possibly my fur coat.<eos> I'd forgotten how beautiful the view is up here.<eos> Oh, I, uh, see you found your coat.
So, I'm looking for someone.<eos> Since when have we had a business relationship?<eos> I get caught even touching a computer, my ass goes away for 20.<eos> Name your price.<eos> You know I'm good for it.
Name your price.<eos> You know I'm good for it.<eos> Information like this doesn't have a price.<eos> Ainsley, everything has a price.<eos> Now, if you don't think you can pull it off, if you lost your edge, just tell me and I'll understand.
You know I'm good for it.<eos> Information like this doesn't have a price.<eos> Ainsley, everything has a price.<eos> Now, if you don't think you can pull it off, if you lost your edge, just tell me and I'll understand.<eos> You wanna know what it is, Cage?
Ainsley, everything has a price.<eos> Now, if you don't think you can pull it off, if you lost your edge, just tell me and I'll understand.<eos> You wanna know what it is, Cage?<eos> What?<eos> I used to think you were the man.
Now, if you don't think you can pull it off, if you lost your edge, just tell me and I'll understand.<eos> You wanna know what it is, Cage?<eos> What?<eos> I used to think you were the man.<eos> But now, I don't know, maybe I feel like you're just working for him.
I used to think you were the man.<eos> But now, I don't know, maybe I feel like you're just working for him.<eos> Come on.<eos> Nobody knows I'm here.<eos> And you know how I am about keeping secrets.
They're practically invisible.<eos> Real MI6 kind of shit.<eos> Disappear on your skin, under your arms, tied around your balls like a Christmas bow.<eos> Unwrap me, then.<eos> You know, studies have proven that sexual consummation irrevocably ruins nine out of 10 relationships.
Real MI6 kind of shit.<eos> Disappear on your skin, under your arms, tied around your balls like a Christmas bow.<eos> Unwrap me, then.<eos> You know, studies have proven that sexual consummation irrevocably ruins nine out of 10 relationships.<eos> Lucky for me, you love to gamble.
The whispers I hear, these ghosts of yours are the real kind of trouble.<eos> They've got training, they've got funding, and they've got no problem running over anyone who gets in their way.<eos> Okay, so, you're worried that I might get hurt?<eos> I'm worried you might get dead.<eos> You know, I'm touched that you can imagine a world without me in it.
That's all I'm saying.<eos> Your ghosts are hanging out in the Philippines.<eos> Figures they'd go to the Pacific.<eos> Some jungle rave that's off the grid.<eos> How the hell did you find it so quickly?
Where is it?<eos> What did you do with Pandora's Box?<eos> It's in a safe place.<eos> That wasn't a part of the plan.<eos> After all these years, you're still shocked when I improvise?
Turns out there's a new mission.<eos> I'm not gonna destroy the one thing I can use to get what we want.<eos> The whole world is looking for us, Xiang.<eos> Let them come!<eos> You worry about pawn sacrifice.
Let them come!<eos> You worry about pawn sacrifice.<eos> I got my eye on the king.<eos> That's the problem.<eos> You forgot the queen.
Gibbons was handed a blank check.<eos> Which is the long way of saying he got you a new ride.<eos> World went and got an upgrade since you died, Cage.<eos> Onboard drones, anti-air countermeasures, and fuel tanks big enough to circumnavigate the globe three times without ever landing.<eos> You can check your coat.
Take your time.<eos> I know mouth-to-mouth if necessary.<eos> Wow!<eos> Are you kidding me with those guns?<eos> You're like the frickin' Terminator!
Kumquat.<eos> What about you?<eos> No. "Safe" isn't in my vocabulary.<eos> Touche.<eos> You are Xander Cage.
Anything you need, Becky can source it within the hour.<eos> Except for any sort of illegal drugs.<eos> Those, I'll have within 15 minutes.<eos> Kidding.<eos> But if you need a fifty of Purple Urkle, I am not the girl to ask.
No.<eos> We're not all jacked up on Mountain Dew and Red Bull, you asshole.<eos> Where'd you find this guy?<eos> Well, there's a first time for everything.<eos> What did you just do?
Well, there's a first time for everything.<eos> What did you just do?<eos> I can't believe this shit.<eos> I'm not gonna have clowns watch my back.<eos> I know I'm gonna regret asking you this, but who would you trust?
You smell that?<eos> Smells like the same shit in a different suit.<eos> You think a dog knows how to work a Frisbee?<eos> Master says, "Fetch," and the bitch listens.<eos> You would look so sexy with a Frisbee in that mouth.
Oh, hey, that's super-cinch body armor.<eos> You've got to tighten the strap... over here.<eos> I got this.<eos> What are you, my handler?<eos> I'm whatever you need.
This is a multistage signal disruptor.<eos> It's very, very breakable.<eos> Can you tell me the real reason behind the crash of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie?<eos> Yes. Ah.<eos> You're one of them, aren't you?
Keep screwing around.<eos> What could possibly go wrong?<eos> That is my style, though. Yeah, good.<eos> Glad to hear it.<eos> Oh, you know, actually, I would rather if you didn't...
That is my style, though. Yeah, good.<eos> Glad to hear it.<eos> Oh, you know, actually, I would rather if you didn't...<eos> That's refreshing.<eos> You actually know what you're doing down there.
30% off the top?<eos> Do I get the girls for a weekend and two coconuts?<eos> 10%.<eos> 10%?<eos> You must've been aiming at the other lawless, uncharted island down the block.
10%?<eos> You must've been aiming at the other lawless, uncharted island down the block.<eos> Happens all the time.<eos> Here's what you do.<eos> You turn around, go get your boat.
You must've been aiming at the other lawless, uncharted island down the block.<eos> Happens all the time.<eos> Here's what you do.<eos> You turn around, go get your boat.<eos> You can kiss my ass.
Here's what you do.<eos> You turn around, go get your boat.<eos> You can kiss my ass.<eos> Okay, hang on.<eos> What do you think?
You turn around, go get your boat.<eos> You can kiss my ass.<eos> Okay, hang on.<eos> What do you think?<eos> You talked me into it!
Okay, hang on.<eos> What do you think?<eos> You talked me into it!<eos> 18%!<eos> You think this is a flea market?
What do you think?<eos> You talked me into it!<eos> 18%!<eos> You think this is a flea market?<eos> You think we're in the hood selling TVs and fake watches, or something like that?
I like your style, man.<eos> Stay on that boat, no matter what.<eos> Adele, Nicks!<eos> All right, guys, keep your earbuds in.<eos> Like always, Adele, you're my eyes in the sky.
Adele, Nicks!<eos> All right, guys, keep your earbuds in.<eos> Like always, Adele, you're my eyes in the sky.<eos> Nicks, you're gonna show 'em how we do it.<eos> You got this?
But your ink's all wrong.<eos> CIA?<eos> They would send in a drone, bomb us to hell.<eos> MI6?<eos> You're not the kind of subtle they prefer.
You're not the kind of subtle they prefer.<eos> You know, the men who come to this island, they're on the run.<eos> Hiding from the world.<eos> But not you.<eos> You're not here to hide.
You know, the men who come to this island, they're on the run.<eos> Hiding from the world.<eos> But not you.<eos> You're not here to hide.<eos> You're looking for someone.
You're looking for someone.<eos> And who's to say I haven't already found her?<eos> Was that meant to scare me?<eos> A little tremble would be nice.<eos> Well, considering you're one tremble away from limping out of here... I'd say I'm close enough.
And who's to say I haven't already found her?<eos> Was that meant to scare me?<eos> A little tremble would be nice.<eos> Well, considering you're one tremble away from limping out of here... I'd say I'm close enough.<eos> Does this mean you're not making me breakfast in the morning?
Well, considering you're one tremble away from limping out of here... I'd say I'm close enough.<eos> Does this mean you're not making me breakfast in the morning?<eos> I'd say you're a couple inches off.<eos> Bit of a stalemate.<eos> Not if you drop the gun.
Stick to the path.<eos> Here, honey.<eos> There's a lot of unmarked graves on the island.<eos> I'll bet whoever sold you that shirt is in one of them.<eos> And how long do you intend to push your luck?
Mate, seriously?<eos> A grenade?<eos> What is this? Eastern Europe in the early '90s?<eos> Next, he's gonna send you a fax.<eos> So, you're willing to kill just to keep that for yourself?
Next, he's gonna send you a fax.<eos> So, you're willing to kill just to keep that for yourself?<eos> That's the wrong question to ask.<eos> What's the right question?<eos> "Are you willing to die for it?"
One grenade, three people.<eos> I like the odds.<eos> Two grenades, three people.<eos> I'm loving these odds.<eos> You ever bleed so much, when you open your eyes, all you see is red?
I'm barely conscious.<eos> Delirious.<eos> Drowning in my own blood.<eos> And all I can hear myself think is, "Today's the day."<eos> "Today's the day you die."
Don't move!<eos> Okay, I actually have what you want.<eos> Pandora's Box?<eos> I got it right here.<eos> But you're wrong, though.
Okay, I actually have what you want.<eos> Pandora's Box?<eos> I got it right here.<eos> But you're wrong, though.<eos> You take it from me, and you die first.
Moscow Mule by the bar.<eos> And then Igor on the stairs.<eos> See where we're going with this?<eos> But none of that matters.<eos> 'Cause like I said, if you take this from me, you die first.
See where we're going with this?<eos> But none of that matters.<eos> 'Cause like I said, if you take this from me, you die first.<eos> I'll take it from you dead or alive.<eos> And if you hold it too tight, I cut your arm off.
Come on, man!<eos> X said stay on the boat.<eos> That was before the goddamn Russian invasion touched down, man!<eos> X said stay on the boat.<eos> You want to play?
That was before the goddamn Russian invasion touched down, man!<eos> X said stay on the boat.<eos> You want to play?<eos> That doesn't belong in anyone's hands.<eos> You want it, come and get it.
We were a new Triple-X team Gibbons created.<eos> We discovered a high-level intelligence officer was trying to manipulate satellites.<eos> And even before we could unmask him,<eos> Gibbons was killed.<eos> So, you knew they were Triple-X all along.
We discovered a high-level intelligence officer was trying to manipulate satellites.<eos> And even before we could unmask him,<eos> Gibbons was killed.<eos> So, you knew they were Triple-X all along.<eos> I needed you to retain a sense of objectivity.
And either we stop it today, or we watch the world burn tomorrow.<eos> Can't lose focus on that.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Where you been?<eos> You stop off for the old rub-and-tug?
Almost never.<eos> And if you needed retinal scans, cell phone data dumps, biometrics of all the superpowers in the world, who would you target?<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Who has that kind of power to actually set that in motion?<eos> Oh, you're pissing up the wrong tree, Cage.
Stop.<eos> Okay, when Xiang broke the window,<eos> he's the only one that didn't flinch.<eos> I need the President on the phone...<eos> That's not gonna come off, you know that, right?
Becky will coordinate earbud communications and have the signal disruptor on standby.<eos> Nicks, when I crashed the boat up on shore and saved your life...<eos> Yeah, whatever, bro.<eos> Do you think that counts as crash 199 for me?<eos> You know, officially?
Nicks, when I crashed the boat up on shore and saved your life...<eos> Yeah, whatever, bro.<eos> Do you think that counts as crash 199 for me?<eos> You know, officially?<eos> Officially, you're deranged.
You've got to get there fast and take this guy down.<eos> Not if we find him first.<eos> Whoa! Red light! Red light!<eos> Whoo! Did you know traffic signals were invented by Big Oil to waste fuel and drive up profits?<eos> If I say yes, will you please just slow down?
Whoo! Did you know traffic signals were invented by Big Oil to waste fuel and drive up profits?<eos> If I say yes, will you please just slow down?<eos> Look out!<eos> Wait.<eos> Is this the part where you act the basic bitch and tell me you got your eye on me and that you don't trust me?
Stop, stop, stop, stop!<eos> Tennyson?<eos> Gridlocked.<eos> There it is.<eos> If you run into trouble, dial nine.
Gridlocked.<eos> There it is.<eos> If you run into trouble, dial nine.<eos> It's an old Gibbons fail-safe.<eos> You crashed my party!
I'm gonna crash yours.<eos> Have fun.<eos> This ain't a party.<eos> This is a race.<eos> What the hell you think you're doing?
I have a plan.<eos> Hold on!<eos> "Hold on" ain't no goddamn plan!<eos> Hi.<eos> You looking for someone?
You looking for someone?<eos> That's 200!<eos> Ha-ha! Come on.<eos> No, no, no...<eos> Xander, you got to get to the top floor.
What the hell's going on out there?<eos> Empty.<eos> Adele, Xander's in.<eos> Find the target, light him up.<eos> Gibbons thought you'd be back.
Adele, Xander's in.<eos> Find the target, light him up.<eos> Gibbons thought you'd be back.<eos> To be the hero we needed.<eos> You take the box to the NSA, and we're right back to where we started.
You take the box to the NSA, and we're right back to where we started.<eos> This is touching.<eos> Gibbons would be proud to see you two working together.<eos> I'm walking out of here, Xander.<eos> You want to know a secret?
This is touching.<eos> Gibbons would be proud to see you two working together.<eos> I'm walking out of here, Xander.<eos> You want to know a secret?<eos> You forgot to put deodorant on?
I'm walking out of here, Xander.<eos> You want to know a secret?<eos> You forgot to put deodorant on?<eos> I killed Gibbons because he was a self-righteous prick.<eos> Do you have a shot?
You want to know a secret?<eos> You forgot to put deodorant on?<eos> I killed Gibbons because he was a self-righteous prick.<eos> Do you have a shot?<eos> Adele, do you have eyes on the target?
Do you have a shot?<eos> Adele, do you have eyes on the target?<eos> I'm switching to thermal.<eos> I was never going to stop downing satellites no matter what happened.<eos> You know why?
I'm switching to thermal.<eos> I was never going to stop downing satellites no matter what happened.<eos> You know why?<eos> Because this world has turned...<eos> Please, please, please tell me you have a shot.
X, can't see you guys.<eos> Thermal's no good.<eos> Right?<eos> I've lost you in the heat.<eos> You don't see what's going on in this world? Take it easy.
Thermal's no good.<eos> Right?<eos> I've lost you in the heat.<eos> You don't see what's going on in this world? Take it easy.<eos> So, what are you gonna do about it?
What's the point of getting up in the morning if you're not gonna reboot the world, right?<eos> Okay.<eos> Easy.<eos> There's a war out there.<eos> We're at war for our survival, you don't see it?
Millions of people have died for nothing...<eos> Read between the lines.<eos> Isn't it right?<eos> I'm gonna be honest with you.<eos> What's been bugging me this whole time is you've got something stuck in between your teeth.
Read between the lines.<eos> Isn't it right?<eos> I'm gonna be honest with you.<eos> What's been bugging me this whole time is you've got something stuck in between your teeth.<eos> What the hell are you talking about?
Just in time.<eos> Watch out, Cage.<eos> Keep this up, people might mistake you for one of the good guys.<eos> Hey, suit.<eos> You got what you wanted.
You got what you wanted.<eos> We both know he's not the bad guy.<eos> And who do we blame for Moscow?<eos> Better a living terrorist than a dead company man.<eos> You see what I'm saying? Let's go.
Let's go, boys.<eos> We recovered Pandora's Box.<eos> They're gonna send an extraction team to pick you guys up.<eos> But they're taking Xiang.<eos> Oh, and, Serena, if you don't hear from me, remember, dial nine.
They're gonna send an extraction team to pick you guys up.<eos> But they're taking Xiang.<eos> Oh, and, Serena, if you don't hear from me, remember, dial nine.<eos> X takes care of its own.<eos> You gave it back to Marke, didn't you?
Clear out, let's go!<eos> It's showtime.<eos> I guess we're on the same team now.<eos> Give me one.<eos> You know me.
Just be where the bullets aren't.<eos> Sadly, the terrorist activated Pandora's Box one last time before we could stop him.<eos> You and your entire team were lost in the blast along with the device itself.<eos> If the world thinks Pandora's Box is gone, then they won't know we're using it to spy on them.<eos> You're just another tyrant.
There, take cover! Okay, okay.<eos> What a rush.<eos> Damn, Becky, that's some body armor.<eos> Hey.<eos> I told you you got no manners.
I've got a plan!<eos> No!<eos> No, no, no!<eos> Listen!<eos> From now on, I make the plans, you execute!
They say it's the last great adventure.<eos> Be sure to send a postcard.<eos> I live for this shit.<eos> Shit.<eos> Nicks, I hope you got that on camera!
Nicks, I hope you got that on camera!<eos> If it ain't on video, it didn't happen!<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Hall of Fame shit right here, bro.<eos> You know I could've done that, right?
Now I know why.<eos> It's exactly the way I left it.<eos> I took it on a date or two.<eos> X takes care of its own.<eos> That's why I figured you'd come through.
X takes care of its own.<eos> That's why I figured you'd come through.<eos> To get a chance to work with the legendary Xander Cage?<eos> Where do I sign up?<eos> You know, you done pissed on the wrong damn picnic.
Gotcha.<eos> This is some pretty surreal shit, being at your own funeral.<eos> I love that song.<eos> And it could be a wonderful world, if we just stopped doing bad shit to it.<eos> If you wanted me out of retirement, you could've just asked me.
This is some pretty surreal shit, being at your own funeral.<eos> I love that song.<eos> And it could be a wonderful world, if we just stopped doing bad shit to it.<eos> If you wanted me out of retirement, you could've just asked me.<eos> You always responded to less subtle motivation.
Let me simplify it for you.<eos> Kick some ass.<eos> Get the girl.<eos> And try to look dope while you're doing it.<eos> You can do "dope," can't you?
Junior, let's bounce!<eos> I'll see you later, X.<eos> I can definitely make that work.<eos> Let's do this.<eos> You got me.
Andy, is that you?<eos> Oh, hi, Zeke.<eos> Did you hear anything?
Oh, hi, Zeke.<eos> Did you hear anything?<eos> Not yet, no.<eos> - Morning, Sally.<eos> - Morning. You hungry?
Hey.<eos> Shh!<eos> Hey, it's just me. It's just me.<eos> Hi.<eos> Did you come down to get some Fruit Loops?
Shh!<eos> Here you go.<eos> There you go.<eos> Okay, now can you do something for me?<eos> When you go back upstairs, don't tell anybody that you saw Daddy down here, okay?
Won't that be fun?<eos> To have just a little secret between the two of us?<eos> All right? Okay, so remember. Now, shh!<eos> Thank you, Uncle Zeke.<eos> Sally, were you speaking to someone down in the basement?
Hang on.<eos> Mornin'.<eos> He's not answering his phone?<eos> Well, you better tell the Feds to meet us there.<eos> Sally Ann, where do you think you're going?
- What?<eos> Want a ride to work?<eos> Hey, baby, it's me.<eos> Hey, I fucking got it.<eos> When can you get away?
Actually, when the bullet hit me, it didn't hurt as much as you'd think.<eos> Well, you're a tougher man than I am.<eos> - Thanks for the ride.<eos> - Don't mention it.<eos> You know, I'm up for good natured ribbing between partners and everything, but when you do it in front of someone, it makes the other person feel weird.
I don't. I don't see how that makes any sense.<eos> - I'm not stranding you, am I?<eos> No, no.<eos> I'll hitch a ride with Beavis and Butthead back there.<eos> Where you going?
- Yeah.<eos> Just keep an eye on those two.<eos> They seem like decent guys. I just.<eos> If Andy turns up, I'd rather hear about it first before he gets gunned down.<eos> You really think Andy's still here?
They seem like decent guys. I just.<eos> If Andy turns up, I'd rather hear about it first before he gets gunned down.<eos> You really think Andy's still here?<eos> He was at the house last night.<eos> Any information I get, you'll be the first to know.
- Well, that's not important.<eos> What matters is, I gotta figure out a way to get that money so we can get the hell out of here.<eos> What's to figure?<eos> Oh. What?<eos> You think Dawkins is just gonna give you the money?
I'm not much of a gun guy, Steph.<eos> - Become one.<eos> - Jesus, Steph!<eos> And go get that money.<eos> Oh, please, Zeke. You can't start a day on nothing but coffee.
And go get that money.<eos> Oh, please, Zeke. You can't start a day on nothing but coffee.<eos> - Aren't you hungry?<eos> - Um, not particularly, no.<eos> - You worried about your brother?
I'm just worried about him.<eos> I know Andy, and he just couldn't do something like this.<eos> Martha, he's my brother and I love him, but, ultimately, it's gonna come down to how bad he wants to save himself.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> Why are you crying, Mommy?
I don't want to know.<eos> What?<eos> But, Ed.<eos> Hey, come on!<eos> First, you send me to that motel. Then, you stick me with this damn bag?
Are you all right there? Yeah, I, uh.<eos> Stephanie Burton called, said that Ed came and went.<eos> So he just came back here to get his clothes?<eos> - He wanted me to go with him.<eos> - And you said no?
Have you seen my face?<eos> I called you, remember?<eos> Listen, we got a dead body in a county that doesn't get dead bodies and a cop with a bullet hole in his arm.<eos> This is a big deal.<eos> So if it turns out that you're lying, you will end up doin' time.
- No, you listen. He'll kill me.<eos> - Nobody is killing anybody.<eos> Tell that to Chris Morrow.<eos> Let me rephrase that.<eos> The best way for nobody else to get killed is for you to tell us what you know.
I think Ed was planning to rip those guys off from moment one.<eos> So what do we do now?<eos> Sikes.<eos> Hang on a sec.<eos> - Where are you?
So what do we do now?<eos> Sikes.<eos> Hang on a sec.<eos> - Where are you?<eos> - Mexico. You should check it out.
Gosh, I'd really love to, but I'm kinda busy right now hunting down my brother.<eos> Don't bother.<eos> I told you, I'm in Mexico.<eos> Jesus, Andy.<eos> What the hell were you thinking?
I'm doing nothing but quickie divorces and hawking life insurance.<eos> Yeah, maybe you should've thought of that before you took Ed's money.<eos> I told you, man, I didn't take Ed's money.<eos> Really?<eos> After all that's happened, you're still gonna lie to me?
I told you, man, I didn't take Ed's money.<eos> Really?<eos> After all that's happened, you're still gonna lie to me?<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> I want to you admit that Ed paid you to drop the reckless manslaughter charge.
Really?<eos> After all that's happened, you're still gonna lie to me?<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> I want to you admit that Ed paid you to drop the reckless manslaughter charge.<eos> I want you to admit you traded a little boy's life for a fancy car.
Fine.<eos> Ed bought me off.<eos> Okay?<eos> You happy?<eos> Andy, you need to turn yourself in.
- That makes sense.<eos> - Hey, who was that?<eos> Martha? - Yeah, sloppy Joes tonight.<eos> I love a sloppy Joe.<eos> Except, this morning, you told me you were having fried chicken, Zeke.
Martha? - Yeah, sloppy Joes tonight.<eos> I love a sloppy Joe.<eos> Except, this morning, you told me you were having fried chicken, Zeke.<eos> Who was that? Your brother?<eos> You really want to know?
I love a sloppy Joe.<eos> Except, this morning, you told me you were having fried chicken, Zeke.<eos> Who was that? Your brother?<eos> You really want to know?<eos> I just don't want you to get yourself into something you can't get out of.
What, are you insane?<eos> Stop, stop!<eos> I know.<eos> No, you're fine.<eos> You're right.
That's awful kind of you to say.<eos> Isn't that nice of him to say, Sally?<eos> What is so funny, little miss giggles?<eos> I swear, sometimes, I don't know what to do with this one.<eos> Are you gonna be my new daddy?
Your daddy is gonna be home very soon safe and sound, okay?<eos> Now, eat that chicken so you can grow up big and strong like your daddy and not small and weak like me.<eos> Okay.<eos> I tell you, you sure have a way with the little ones.<eos> Why didn't you ever settle down and have one of your own?
Now, eat that chicken so you can grow up big and strong like your daddy and not small and weak like me.<eos> Okay.<eos> I tell you, you sure have a way with the little ones.<eos> Why didn't you ever settle down and have one of your own?<eos> Sally Ann Sikes, what in God's name do you think you're doing?
I tell you, you sure have a way with the little ones.<eos> Why didn't you ever settle down and have one of your own?<eos> Sally Ann Sikes, what in God's name do you think you're doing?<eos> On second thought, consider yourself lucky.<eos> You are so beautiful.
You name it, he used it.<eos> But this stuff.<eos> I mean, for a thousand bucks, I went straight to the magic man.<eos> Can I have a kiss?<eos> I thought you were still mad at me.
But this stuff.<eos> I mean, for a thousand bucks, I went straight to the magic man.<eos> Can I have a kiss?<eos> I thought you were still mad at me.<eos> No, I was never mad at you. You were young, you needed money.
- Oh, sorry, honey.<eos> It's not you. It's the drugs.<eos> Sometimes, these things just flush me right out.<eos> - Andy!<eos> What the hell are you doing here?
- Don't you play fucking dumb with me!<eos> - I don't have it!<eos> - Really? - You haven't seen Ed recently?<eos> - I'm afraid you've been misinformed.<eos> You should be afraid that I'm gonna shoot you in the.
You should be afraid that I'm gonna shoot you in the.<eos> Seriously?<eos> Under the fuckin' bed?<eos> You didn't think I was gonna search under the goddamn bed?<eos> Andy, think about what you're doing.
You didn't think I was gonna search under the goddamn bed?<eos> Andy, think about what you're doing.<eos> - Ed will kill you.<eos> - Fuck Ed! He should be afraid I'm gonna kill him!<eos> You know, I just don't get it.
Andy, think about what you're doing.<eos> - Ed will kill you.<eos> - Fuck Ed! He should be afraid I'm gonna kill him!<eos> You know, I just don't get it.<eos> Why are you helping him?
- Fuck Ed! He should be afraid I'm gonna kill him!<eos> You know, I just don't get it.<eos> Why are you helping him?<eos> None of your business.<eos> Look, you have your money, right?
You know, I just don't get it.<eos> Why are you helping him?<eos> None of your business.<eos> Look, you have your money, right?<eos> Why don't you just go?
Why are you helping him?<eos> None of your business.<eos> Look, you have your money, right?<eos> Why don't you just go?<eos> You've got everything.
None of your business.<eos> Look, you have your money, right?<eos> Why don't you just go?<eos> You've got everything.<eos> You've got a career.
Look, you have your money, right?<eos> Why don't you just go?<eos> You've got everything.<eos> You've got a career.<eos> In fact, I heard you're running for the goddamn Senate.
Please don't open that door, I'm begging you.<eos> - Get your hands off me!<eos> - Andy, I'm on my knees.<eos> Please, let's just talk about it.<eos> Once you open that door, there's no going back.
- Andy, I'm on my knees.<eos> Please, let's just talk about it.<eos> Once you open that door, there's no going back.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Allison, do you know where my slippers are?
Once you open that door, there's no going back.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Allison, do you know where my slippers are?<eos> Allison?<eos> Hey, Allison, do you know where my slippers are?
Stop talking!<eos> Our Father, Who art in heaven.<eos> Stop praying!<eos> God!<eos> If you tell one goddamn soul, I will fucking kill you.
Get out!<eos> Good night, Steph.<eos> Sleep tight.<eos> Let me ask you something.<eos> Do you think my wife's hot?
She's hot enough. She's hot.<eos> She's.<eos> What do you mean by hot enough?<eos> - She's plenty hot.<eos> - You qualified it with enough.
All three suspects are considered armed and dangerous.<eos> Sheriff Ezekiel Sikes was shot and wounded as he attempted to foil the robbery.<eos> Ed shot Zeke?<eos> Holy shit!<eos> Hey, where are you going?
Oh, gee, Chris, maybe it was the cops who pulled us over for speeding half a mile from the fucking bank!<eos> - We were making a getaway.<eos> - Ugh! I'll take you. I'll just drive you.<eos> No, no!<eos> Listen, cockbrain, you've gotta get your shit together.
- We were making a getaway.<eos> - Ugh! I'll take you. I'll just drive you.<eos> No, no!<eos> Listen, cockbrain, you've gotta get your shit together.<eos> Your car is blazing hot. - You gotta stash it somewhere.
Okay, then what?<eos> Okay.<eos> Chris, listen to me.<eos> Listen good, okay?<eos> You are gonna stash your car in one of these barns. Then, you are gonna do nothing.
Okay.<eos> Chris, listen to me.<eos> Listen good, okay?<eos> You are gonna stash your car in one of these barns. Then, you are gonna do nothing.<eos> You are gonna say there.
Listen good, okay?<eos> You are gonna stash your car in one of these barns. Then, you are gonna do nothing.<eos> You are gonna say there.<eos> You're gonna stay put.<eos> Do you understand me?
You are gonna say there.<eos> You're gonna stay put.<eos> Do you understand me?<eos> Until tonight.<eos> You are gonna meet me at ten o'clock at Rudy's scrapyard. Okay?
- You're not all gone, are you, Chris?<eos> Sorry I'm late.<eos> I saw her coming back from the cemetery.<eos> Figured it was better than sitting in front of an empty house. Uh-huh.<eos> - Hey, Steph, how you feeling?
Figured it was better than sitting in front of an empty house. Uh-huh.<eos> - Hey, Steph, how you feeling?<eos> - How am I feeling?<eos> Like the idiot wife of an ex-con who just shot a cop and split town.<eos> - How are you feeling?
Like the idiot wife of an ex-con who just shot a cop and split town.<eos> - How are you feeling?<eos> - Not great, either.<eos> Has Ed been acting strange at all, lately?<eos> You notice anything?
Chris?<eos> Chris, it's Zeke Sikes!<eos> Chris?<eos> Chris, Zeke Sikes!<eos> If you're in there.
Ed doesn't trust that Andy won't do something stupid.<eos> But he can trust you, right?<eos> Of course, he can trust me.<eos> Good.<eos> You have a pen?
- Oh, yeah?<eos> Then where the hell is Daddy?<eos> - He's working late, goddamn it!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I know you're upset, too.
Hurry up!<eos> Hey, I made it!<eos> Is that. Is that what I think it is?<eos> Shit.<eos> - Chris, have you changed your clothes?
Is that. Is that what I think it is?<eos> Shit.<eos> - Chris, have you changed your clothes?<eos> - Since when?<eos> - Since you robbed the bank?
We're going to Mexico.<eos> Oh, well, that's smart.<eos> Ed's a smart guy.<eos> Listen, do you mind if I hop in the shower?<eos> You want to take a shower?
Listen, do you mind if I hop in the shower?<eos> You want to take a shower?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> I always figured you sorta hated me on account of what happened to Ed Jr.
That was an accident.<eos> Put your gun down, Chris.<eos> Relax.<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> You know who I am, son. I'm Judge Dawkins.
Put your gun down, Chris.<eos> Relax.<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> You know who I am, son. I'm Judge Dawkins.<eos> What the hell are you doing here?
Chris, don't trust him.<eos> Steph, what the hell's going on?<eos> Chris, if he takes the money, we'll never see a penny of it.<eos> I don't want the money.<eos> Steph, what the hell are you doing?
Jesus, Judge.<eos> I didn't. I didn't.<eos> What have I. What have I done?<eos> You killed him.<eos> You provoked him!
I didn't. I didn't.<eos> What have I. What have I done?<eos> You killed him.<eos> You provoked him!<eos> Why did you provoke him?
Rudy's scrapyard at ten. I got it. Okay.<eos> I'll see you there.<eos> Fucking asshole!<eos> Shh.<eos> - What the heck are you doing?
Fucking asshole!<eos> Shh.<eos> - What the heck are you doing?<eos> - Huh? Oh, nothing. Uh, go back to sleep, honey.<eos> - You're obviously doing something.
- You're obviously doing something.<eos> - It's a. It's a surprise.<eos> That'll be the day.<eos> - Are you all right, dear?<eos> You're shaking.
That'll be the day.<eos> - Are you all right, dear?<eos> You're shaking.<eos> - Oh, I'm fine.<eos> You're not fine. You're shaking.
You're shaking.<eos> - Oh, I'm fine.<eos> You're not fine. You're shaking.<eos> Hey, listen, what do you say the four of us go up to the cabin this weekend? We can spend the weekend up there.<eos> You can take the kids up there tomorrow, and then get a head start on the clean-up.

We can spend the weekend up there.<eos> You can take the kids up there tomorrow, and then get a head start on the clean-up.<eos> I see.<eos> You want to get rid of us so you can host one of your big poker games.

- I don't know. I don't know.<eos> Forget it.<eos> I love you, that's all. And, uh.<eos> I wish. I could be a better husband to you.<eos> It's just a poker game, dear. You don't have to feel so guilty.
- You all right?<eos> - I'm fine.<eos> - Big day today, huh?<eos> - I suppose it is, yeah.<eos> I thought you'd be more excited.
I thought you'd be more excited.<eos> I don't know.<eos> When I was in prison, I told myself that I'd be done with this life, get on the straight and narrow.<eos> Robbing banks isn't exactly straight and narrow.<eos> Then why are you doing it?
When I was in prison, I told myself that I'd be done with this life, get on the straight and narrow.<eos> Robbing banks isn't exactly straight and narrow.<eos> Then why are you doing it?<eos> - That's a stupid fucking question.<eos> - Why are you doing it?
- That's a stupid fucking question.<eos> - Why are you doing it?<eos> - For you.<eos> - Bullshit.<eos> You're doing it for you.
Okay, we got no money. We got no fucking opportunities.<eos> What are we supposed to do, huh?<eos> You tell me, Steph. - What are we supposed to do?<eos> - Nothing, I guess. I.<eos> I suppose this is just who you are.
You tell me, Steph. - What are we supposed to do?<eos> - Nothing, I guess. I.<eos> I suppose this is just who you are.<eos> What the hell do you want from me, huh?<eos> For starters, you could accept responsibility for my son's death.
- Nothing, I guess. I.<eos> I suppose this is just who you are.<eos> What the hell do you want from me, huh?<eos> For starters, you could accept responsibility for my son's death.<eos> You are never gonna get over it, are you?
For starters, you could accept responsibility for my son's death.<eos> You are never gonna get over it, are you?<eos> Get over it?<eos> It's not a cold, Ed.<eos> - You don't think that I hurt, too?
The school called us 'cause he was sick!<eos> He had a stomachache and I'm the one who answered!<eos> - I was at work!<eos> - So was I!<eos> At a drug lab! And you killed my son!
He had a stomachache and I'm the one who answered!<eos> - I was at work!<eos> - So was I!<eos> At a drug lab! And you killed my son!<eos> You don't scare me, Ed.
- I was at work!<eos> - So was I!<eos> At a drug lab! And you killed my son!<eos> You don't scare me, Ed.<eos> You only kill people by accident.
Wait, tonight?<eos> No, um.<eos> Sorry, I can't tonight.<eos> I got a football reunion.<eos> You're gonna miss your daughter's dance recital so you can drink beer with a bunch of degenerates.
He's gotta work at the bank.<eos> Oh, well, if he can miss it, then surely you can.<eos> You weren't even on the team when they won.<eos> Okay, hey, sweetie.<eos> Hey! You know what?
Hey! You know what?<eos> I'm so sorry I'm gonna miss your thing tonight, but I have an idea.<eos> What about tomorrow you and me, we go to Funland?<eos> She's got school tomorrow.<eos> You don't want to skip school and spend the day with your dad?
- How's it going, Reed?<eos> The back, huh?<eos> Never been back here.<eos> I have.<eos> My guess is. You don't wash it after the canine unit uses it.
- Reggie Cutler.<eos> - Fuck, that guy was big.<eos> - He just laid you out mid-jiggle.<eos> - He was huge.<eos> And then, 30 seconds later, you stare up at me and you're like,
Lay it on me, brother.<eos> You've got a lot of nerve blackmailing me twice with the same tape.<eos> Yeah, I don't know. It just kinda felt like a two-chit tape.<eos> You know, now, especially. I hear you're running for the Senate.<eos> Burton, if you ever show up flaunting this tape in my face again, I swear to God, I'm gonna.
Oh, Jesus fuck!<eos> Whenever you're ready with those digits, Judge.<eos> It's, uh. Six, three times to the left, 28, four times to the right, 86, three times to the left.<eos> Three times to the left. Got it.<eos> You can kickoff whenever you're ready, man.

Nah, nah.<eos> Bank duty is the sheriff's job.<eos> Dawkins will give me hell if it's not me guarding his precious crop money.<eos> Plus, I don't want to ruin your night.<eos> You seeing this mysterious Wendy again?
Holy shit!<eos> You are.<eos> - Is it getting serious?<eos> - No, it's just dinner.<eos> That's how it starts, and then the next thing you know, little Wendys running all around your house.
- Five minutes.<eos> Easy in, easy out. You don't even have to leave your car.<eos> Yeah, well, why are we taking my car anyway?<eos> Because everyone knows I drive a bitchin' Camaro and Andy drives a gay-ass Porsche.<eos> No one has the slightest clue as to what you drive. That's why.

You don't even have to leave your car.<eos> Yeah, well, why are we taking my car anyway?<eos> Because everyone knows I drive a bitchin' Camaro and Andy drives a gay-ass Porsche.<eos> No one has the slightest clue as to what you drive. That's why.<eos> They probably think that you don't even know how to drive.
I think he figures that the fact that he's inside, no one is gonna try anything.<eos> Seriously, he must be the stupidest cop in the history of the police force.<eos> - Hey, Ed, can I talk to you a sec?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You know, you really shouldn't talk about your own brother like that.
I'm sorry about what happened this morning.<eos> Wow.<eos> That's a new one.<eos> Listen, I've. I've been thinking about what you said.<eos> About how you thought you'd left this life behind.
Listen, I've. I've been thinking about what you said.<eos> About how you thought you'd left this life behind.<eos> Did you mean that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Then you should call this whole thing off.
Ed, I'm serious.<eos> It's not too late.<eos> Don't get skittish on me now, all right?<eos> We got this.<eos> Trust me. You're gonna be singing a very different tune in a few hours when you're a very rich woman.
Destroy it!<eos> - I can't!<eos> - Cuff yourself!<eos> - Too high.<eos> - What are you doing?
- I can't!<eos> - Cuff yourself!<eos> - Too high.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> What are you doing? Smash it!
Just smash it! Smash it!<eos> Smash it!<eos> - Smash it!<eos> Smash it!<eos> What are you doing?
Unlock vault.<eos> Shut the fuck up!<eos> Or I'll shoot you in the face!<eos> Hey, what's happening?<eos> What the fuck do you think is happening?
Okay.<eos> Fuck!<eos> Come on!<eos> What is this, The Price is Right?<eos> How many times you gonna spin that dial?
How many times you gonna spin that dial?<eos> - Shut up or I'll shoot you.<eos> - In the face. I get it, I get it.<eos> - Do you mind if I finish my dinner?<eos> - Will you just shut the fuck up?
- In the face. I get it, I get it.<eos> - Do you mind if I finish my dinner?<eos> - Will you just shut the fuck up?<eos> Fuck!<eos> What are you doing?
- Do you mind if I finish my dinner?<eos> - Will you just shut the fuck up?<eos> Fuck!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> What are you doing?
Get back!<eos> - Just a second.<eos> - Get back! Stay back!<eos> Stay back! I'll shoot!<eos> What are you.? Go back! Go back!
- Just a second.<eos> - Get back! Stay back!<eos> Stay back! I'll shoot!<eos> What are you.? Go back! Go back!<eos> What are you doing?

What are you.? Go back! Go back!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> What the fuck are you doing? What are you.?<eos> Let me see it.<eos> You think I care about the money?
Let me see it.<eos> You think I care about the money?<eos> It's all federally insured anyway.<eos> You.?<eos> You don't care if I take the money?
Yeah, it's me!<eos> I'm gonna be long gone, anyway, by the time they get you out of that fucking vault.<eos> So, here. Good luck.<eos> It's 86.<eos> How do you read that as a fucking eight, huh?
Yeah.<eos> I can see it now with my. with my mask off.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah!<eos> Hey, Andy, you think when this is all over, things will go back to the way they were before?
They fucking love 'em.<eos> We had some pretty good times back in the day.<eos> You and me.<eos> But now, 'cause of tonight. I'll probably never see you again.<eos> I guess that means you're not planning on shootin' me.
We had some pretty good times back in the day.<eos> You and me.<eos> But now, 'cause of tonight. I'll probably never see you again.<eos> I guess that means you're not planning on shootin' me.<eos> Come on, Z, you think I'm actually capable of doing something like that?
Jesus Christ.<eos> I don't know.<eos> You killed Ed Jr. pretty good.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> You heard me.
Hey. Here.<eos> Get in the fucking vault!<eos> Get in the fucking vault, Zeke!<eos> And if I suffocate in there before morning, I guess that'll be an accident too, right?<eos> Do you want me to kill you?
Get in the fucking vault, Zeke!<eos> And if I suffocate in there before morning, I guess that'll be an accident too, right?<eos> Do you want me to kill you?<eos> 'Cause I can fucking do that!<eos> You know what they say.
Oh, shit!<eos> What the fuck?<eos> What the fuck is happening, man?<eos> What's happening?<eos> You're robbing a bank, Ed.
What the fuck?<eos> What the fuck is happening, man?<eos> What's happening?<eos> You're robbing a bank, Ed.<eos> And pretty soon, you're gonna shoot me, and then race out that door with the money.
What the fuck is happening, man?<eos> What's happening?<eos> You're robbing a bank, Ed.<eos> And pretty soon, you're gonna shoot me, and then race out that door with the money.<eos> But first, you'll kill Chris. Maybe Dawkins. But probably Chris, then Dawkins.

And pretty soon, you're gonna shoot me, and then race out that door with the money.<eos> But first, you'll kill Chris. Maybe Dawkins. But probably Chris, then Dawkins.<eos> And once they're dead, you'll kill Andy.<eos> What?<eos> And then, once all your loose ends are tied up, you're gonna disappear with the money, never to be heard from again.
And then, once all your loose ends are tied up, you're gonna disappear with the money, never to be heard from again.<eos> Except.<eos> None of that's gonna happen 'cause I'm gonna kill you. And I'm gonna bury you in a hole out by Shimmer Lake.<eos> What?<eos> Why are you doing this?
Except.<eos> None of that's gonna happen 'cause I'm gonna kill you. And I'm gonna bury you in a hole out by Shimmer Lake.<eos> What?<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> Why are you doing this, Zeke?
We couldn't just let you get away with it.<eos> Not you.<eos> Not Chris Morrow. Not Andy Sikes.<eos> Not Brad Dawkins.<eos> He wasn't dead two weeks and you were already cutting a deal.
Not you.<eos> Not Chris Morrow. Not Andy Sikes.<eos> Not Brad Dawkins.<eos> He wasn't dead two weeks and you were already cutting a deal.<eos> You stole him from us.
Not Chris Morrow. Not Andy Sikes.<eos> Not Brad Dawkins.<eos> He wasn't dead two weeks and you were already cutting a deal.<eos> You stole him from us.<eos> You stole my baby.
Oh, come on. Come on.<eos> He was my baby too, okay?<eos> Don't you get it?<eos> He wasn't your baby.<eos> What are you talking about?
Steph and I made a mistake.<eos> No.<eos> I stayed with you because I still loved you.<eos> And I hoped seeing that beautiful boy could have straightened us out, could have. Could have saved us.<eos> Then you killed him.
It was an accident.<eos> It was an accident.<eos> Zeke.<eos> We thought we were doing the right thing.<eos> We thought you'd changed.
I'm going in.<eos> - The fuck you are!<eos> - I'm going in there!<eos> No!<eos> No, Chris, you're the driver.
This is a real mess.<eos> - Yeah, it's an old mess.<eos> How do you mean?<eos> I mean, this is what happens when wrongs go unrighted.<eos> You talking about Ed Jr.?
Shit!<eos> We were invited to Henry Grotsky's son's wedding.<eos> We got invited to Henry Grotsky's son's wedding?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why are you saying it like that?
We're going.<eos> This place will be fine without us for a weekend.<eos> No.<eos> Not going.<eos> Jerry, you're the president of idiots.
This place will be fine without us for a weekend.<eos> No.<eos> Not going.<eos> Jerry, you're the president of idiots.<eos> Bina, you're the dummy who voted me into office.
I'm flat-out naked in here, so...<eos> Renzo Eckberg, your manhood is nothing to be ashamed of.<eos> Your manhood is a glory to God.<eos> Open the door a crack, I'll fling it in.<eos> This could be how you meet the love of your life.

Girls are always so drunk and emotional at weddings.<eos> Maybe that's where you'll really shine.<eos> Should I start hanging out at wakes too?<eos> Oh, let's see how the wedding goes first.<eos> You got a letter from someone.
Good boy!<eos> Why, thank you, Ringo.<eos> Oh, my!<eos> Oh, Ringo!<eos> I, Francie. .. Take you, Douglas, as you are... To love and to cherish... to have and to hold...
You look good, ladies.<eos> Right here.<eos> I'll see you in there.<eos> Hi. Hey.<eos> You're here.
I'll see you in there.<eos> Hi. Hey.<eos> You're here.<eos> That's c...<eos> Why are you here?
Jo Flanagan.<eos> That's Jo with a "J" and an "O" and no<eos> I'm Renzo.<eos> With an "E" and an "O" and no<eos> You have an intense look about you, Renzo.
You guys swingers?<eos> No, you're not.<eos> Right? No.<eos> Renzo, pick up the phone-Renzo, pick up the phone.<eos> Did you not request a singles' table?
Renzo, pick up the phone-Renzo, pick up the phone.<eos> Did you not request a singles' table?<eos> Because so far, it's slim pickings.<eos> It was on the RSVP.<eos> You put it there yourself.
Hollywood marriages bust up all the time because of the nanny.<eos> And you know what, Renzo?<eos> Even if she is a little older, so what?<eos> There's something to be said for know-how, experience and someone who's seen a lot of things.<eos> You don't want somebody perfect for your first dance.
Not that you asked, but this is where I'm sitting so if you end up in the high teens, you know where to find me.<eos> Shit!<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Are you feeling all right?<eos> What do you say your name is?
Megan-Ann.<eos> Okay. I will not forget.<eos> I should have married Leroy while I had the chance.<eos> Leroy knew where to put his hands.<eos> Ah, you're the killer, Nyung.
It's not gonna be what you want to hear.<eos> It won't be what she wants to hear.<eos> You're Jo Flanagan, right?<eos> You're the nanny. Francie's nanny.<eos> How do you know that?
- Right.<eos> And I'm Walter, just a successful businessman who just likes to read his favorite book.<eos> That one.<eos> And you're Grotsky's friend's kid?<eos> You requested the singles' table. That was never gonna happen.

You requested the singles' table. That was never gonna happen.<eos> How do you know us?<eos> So, Francie, today's bride, is my oldest friend.<eos> Oh... Thank you!<eos> There's been a long discussion about what kind of table this is and you've just resolved it!
Meanwhile, enjoy the open bar.<eos> Come on, what does that mean?<eos> What does that mean?<eos> It means you leave me a voicemail telling me to tell Francie not to open your RSVP card.<eos> Then you leave me a voicemail telling me that you're coming and then another one saying "Disregard the last one."

Hey, guys, right here.<eos> Come on, El, please don't go all crazy.<eos> "All crazy"?<eos> Now what does that mean?<eos> It means you get mad.
Come on, El, please don't go all crazy.<eos> "All crazy"?<eos> Now what does that mean?<eos> It means you get mad.<eos> You do something big and you can't take it back and it's too late, and then...
Nikki can calm down.<eos> What is the deal with Nikki?<eos> Really?<eos> Wow. "What's the deal with Nikki?" That's funny.<eos> Why would you care about Nikki if you're just here for my sister?
What is the deal with Nikki?<eos> Really?<eos> Wow. "What's the deal with Nikki?" That's funny.<eos> Why would you care about Nikki if you're just here for my sister?<eos> You're right.
Wow. "What's the deal with Nikki?" That's funny.<eos> Why would you care about Nikki if you're just here for my sister?<eos> You're right.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You're right.
Why would you care about Nikki if you're just here for my sister?<eos> You're right.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You're right.<eos> It's none of my business if you cheated on me with her.
Come on!<eos> I didn't cheat on you with her.<eos> It started after we broke up and you dropped out as maid of honor.<eos> How does a guy who...<eos> After two years, you break up with me over text?
It started after we broke up and you dropped out as maid of honor.<eos> How does a guy who...<eos> After two years, you break up with me over text?<eos> "Good luck with your future endeavors"?<eos> Were you firing me?
After two years, you break up with me over text?<eos> "Good luck with your future endeavors"?<eos> Were you firing me?<eos> What the f...<eos> You're an asshole.
You're a ridiculous asshole.<eos> Why don't you just go home?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Before you ruin all this for Francie.
Hey, Jerry Kepp.<eos> Uh-huh. Just a hypothetical.<eos> If someone offered you 20 bucks to go up to our room and read your book in the tub, would you?<eos> Say yes.<eos> No. You know how I feel about a hotel bathtub.
Okay, I'm sorry.<eos> Bina, stand up.<eos> Bina, please, stand up right now, please.<eos> Why?<eos> I will give you 20 unhypothetical dollars if you stand up right now.
Okay, look.<eos> Teddy broke up with you.<eos> I know how hard that can be, okay?<eos> A long time ago, he broke up with me to go out with you, so I get it.<eos> But you have to stop now.
I was Francie's first choice for maid of honor.<eos> I was Teddy's first choice for a girlfriend.<eos> Sometimes, first sticks. Sometimes, it doesn't.<eos> He listened to every voicemail I sent, so what does that tell you?<eos> Tells me you don't know when to stop calling.
That's funny. Last week, I did a search history on our computer.<eos> And one of us looked up "Topless Dame Helen Mirren."<eos> Wasn't me.<eos> M-I-R-R-E-N.<eos> Why did you do that?
And one of us looked up "Topless Dame Helen Mirren."<eos> Wasn't me.<eos> M-I-R-R-E-N.<eos> Why did you do that?<eos> Why did you come here?
Since when does a man need a reason to go to a wedding with his own wife?<eos> See?<eos> He has a pathological aversion to answering a question directly.<eos> He always answers with another question.<eos> Why did you make Facebook friends with Henry Grotsky on Facebook?
Tom Fo?<eos> Well, Henry Grotsky owns five diners in Central Ohio.<eos> We own a diner in Central Ohio.<eos> Everyone who owns a diner in Central Ohio is Facebook friends.<eos> You'd know that if you paid attention.
Helen Mirren will be thrilled.<eos> Renzo, pick up the phone-Renzo, pick up.<eos> Not now, big fight.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> You look lost.
Not now, big fight.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> You look lost.<eos> I do?<eos> If you need help, just ask us.
You look lost.<eos> I do?<eos> If you need help, just ask us.<eos> Sorry, "If I need help"?<eos> Do you? Do you need my help?
But today, I'm only going to ask for her hand in this dance.<eos> And the rest of her, along with her body.<eos> Good.<eos> No, I don't think that's...<eos> You don't want to dance, right?
Well.<eos> I'd probably say this corner right here is where I'd go for that.<eos> The meter clicks Ugh.<eos> Please don't let me make a fool of myself.<eos> Mom, you could never make a fool of yourself.
I'd probably say this corner right here is where I'd go for that.<eos> The meter clicks Ugh.<eos> Please don't let me make a fool of myself.<eos> Mom, you could never make a fool of yourself.<eos> You couldn't make it.
I shouldn't.<eos> Sure.<eos> Oh, seriously?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, God, you're not somebody's date in there, are you?
Oh, seriously?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, God, you're not somebody's date in there, are you?<eos> No.<eos> Because you're not at a table.
Yeah.<eos> Oh, God, you're not somebody's date in there, are you?<eos> No.<eos> Because you're not at a table.<eos> You're crashing the wedding?
Oh, God, you're not somebody's date in there, are you?<eos> No.<eos> Because you're not at a table.<eos> You're crashing the wedding?<eos> You gotta stay for the food.
Do none of you care that that girl is obviously pregnant?<eos> What? Huh?<eos> You children are such a disappointment.<eos> Go away, please.<eos> You're right.
But what's done is done.<eos> No.<eos> Wait.<eos> I know what happened.<eos> He ended it with a text message when you told him you were pregnant.
I had too many of the mini hotdogs and...<eos> Can we just forget about it?<eos> That won't be easy.<eos> Teddy Millner is leaving you to raise a child alone.<eos> If you even go...
That won't be easy.<eos> Teddy Millner is leaving you to raise a child alone.<eos> If you even go...<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> If you even go through with the pregnancy.
They don't provide them.<eos> You guys probably already know this, but that's not a question you're supposed to ask a fancy place like this unless you're a successful businessman.<eos> Which I am.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> You looked like you got sick.
Oh, my God.<eos> I'm sorry, what's going on now?<eos> I'm just...<eos> I never did like you, not even as a child.<eos> Teddy Millner, did you dump this girl immediately after she told you she was pregnant?
I'm just...<eos> I never did like you, not even as a child.<eos> Teddy Millner, did you dump this girl immediately after she told you she was pregnant?<eos> Okay-<eos> You didn't tell them what you said.
I never did like you, not even as a child.<eos> Teddy Millner, did you dump this girl immediately after she told you she was pregnant?<eos> Okay-<eos> You didn't tell them what you said.<eos> Wait, what did you say?
What did I say?<eos> She said that we'd be ridiculous parents.<eos> No, I...<eos> Not like that. Yes, you did.<eos> You said I'd be a ridiculous father.
She said that we'd be ridiculous parents.<eos> No, I...<eos> Not like that. Yes, you did.<eos> You said I'd be a ridiculous father.<eos> You asked me if I wanted to keep it.
No, I...<eos> Not like that. Yes, you did.<eos> You said I'd be a ridiculous father.<eos> You asked me if I wanted to keep it.<eos> Then I asked you if you would want to keep it and you didn't say anything to that.
You said I'd be a ridiculous father.<eos> You asked me if I wanted to keep it.<eos> Then I asked you if you would want to keep it and you didn't say anything to that.<eos> So then I said we were ridiculous.<eos> It was after you called me ridiculous because why would you want to keep our kid if you thought that I was just a...
So then I said we were ridiculous.<eos> It was after you called me ridiculous because why would you want to keep our kid if you thought that I was just a...<eos> That I was just a joke?<eos> It was before.<eos> And you were looking for a way out, man!
And you were looking for a way out, man!<eos> I get that now.<eos> Everyone we know says we were wrong together.<eos> Your mother wouldn't stop saying that I was not the kind of girl who ended up with you.<eos> And when it was time for you to stand up and say that she's wrong and they're all wrong and they're idiots and stand by me, then you ask me if I want to keep it.
And when it was time for you to stand up and say that she's wrong and they're all wrong and they're idiots and stand by me, then you ask me if I want to keep it.<eos> That's your first question.<eos> What was I supposed to say, El?<eos> I constantly disappoint you.<eos> Then you tell me that you think our kid will grow up thinking that I'm just a joke.
I constantly disappoint you.<eos> Then you tell me that you think our kid will grow up thinking that I'm just a joke.<eos> That I was never good enough for you.<eos> And you finally found a way to tell me.<eos> And I was so scared of losing you that when you told me you were pregnant, lasked if you wanted to keep the kid.
Three...<eos> Actually, over three years ago.<eos> But no one's counting.<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> You don't have to do this.
It might be best.<eos> If Uncle Roger finds out, he might tell my parole officer and then they'd send me back to jail or extend my time at the halfway house.<eos> I share a room with a man called Jalapeno who has a smiley face tattooed on the end of his penis so that when he pees it looks like it's vomiting sunshine.<eos> He's not as sweet as he sounds.<eos> Well, then you shouldn't do it.
I just wanted to say sorry.<eos> I take things too far.<eos> Usually, I'm the only one who gets hurt, but it didn't work out like that today, so I'm sorry.<eos> Join us.<eos> Or do you have somewhere else to be?
Who smokes pot?<eos> Are you a potter?<eos> - No.<eos> - No?<eos> You're a pothead.
Are you a potter?<eos> - No.<eos> - No?<eos> You're a pothead.<eos> You got a table with a lot of your friends
Bina took over her family's diner.<eos> And I got suckered into managing it after we got married just like she wanted.<eos> Like I wanted?<eos> Who else would've wanted that?<eos> You asked my father if you could.
And I got suckered into managing it after we got married just like she wanted.<eos> Like I wanted?<eos> Who else would've wanted that?<eos> You asked my father if you could.<eos> You renamed the family diner after yourself.
That was your idea.<eos> What?<eos> I wanted to be a high school guidance counselor but instead I went to prison.<eos> You made the right decision.<eos> How did you steal all that money?
Right. Yeah, well, uh...<eos> Roger got me a job in his office when he worked for the Ford Motor Company.<eos> I'm quite good with numbers, so I worked out a way to steal $125,000.<eos> So I did.<eos> What did you do with it?
So I did.<eos> What did you do with it?<eos> Oh, it wasn't for myself.<eos> My friend Eric, who's an absolute sweetheart, a lovely bloke, his wife was very sick and needed an operation.<eos> Well, then you saved a life.
On account of the fact she didn't exist.<eos> I don't think he'd ever been married.<eos> What?<eos> He made it up just for the money.<eos> You just called him a sweetheart!
My junior prom is tonight.<eos> But my mom said I'd probably have a better chance here where nobody knew me, so...<eos> I would have danced with you.<eos> Now, in high school, I certainly would have danced with you.<eos> And if you want to dance now, we can just turn on the radio and just dance.
The world feels almost perfect right now.<eos> Crap!<eos> That's cool.<eos> I'm cool.<eos> I know why you came!
Crap!<eos> That's cool.<eos> I'm cool.<eos> I know why you came!<eos> You love weddings?
I'm cool.<eos> I know why you came!<eos> You love weddings?<eos> Please.<eos> You couldn't get through our wedding day fast enough.
I know why you came!<eos> You love weddings?<eos> Please.<eos> You couldn't get through our wedding day fast enough.<eos> It's funny it took me so long because honestly, Bina, I didn't think you had it in you to surprise me.
You couldn't get through our wedding day fast enough.<eos> It's funny it took me so long because honestly, Bina, I didn't think you had it in you to surprise me.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You're many things, Bina, but surprising is not one of them.
It's funny it took me so long because honestly, Bina, I didn't think you had it in you to surprise me.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You're many things, Bina, but surprising is not one of them.<eos> When you went to the bathroom in the nanny's room, you used the phone.
You're many things, Bina, but surprising is not one of them.<eos> When you went to the bathroom in the nanny's room, you used the phone.<eos> Uh-huh. I know this because a little light came on in the bedroom when you did that.<eos> Okay.<eos> So, who did you call, Bina?
When you went to the bathroom in the nanny's room, you used the phone.<eos> Uh-huh. I know this because a little light came on in the bedroom when you did that.<eos> Okay.<eos> So, who did you call, Bina?<eos> You only know two people at this wedding and I'm one of them.
Uh-huh. I know this because a little light came on in the bedroom when you did that.<eos> Okay.<eos> So, who did you call, Bina?<eos> You only know two people at this wedding and I'm one of them.<eos> You're arranging to meet with Henry Grotsky after the Wedding's over?
So, who did you call, Bina?<eos> You only know two people at this wedding and I'm one of them.<eos> You're arranging to meet with Henry Grotsky after the Wedding's over?<eos> Maybe back in the ballroom after the happy couple is gone and I'm upstairs in the room?<eos> You're gonna sell our diner to Henry Grotsky.
No way.<eos> I know you.<eos> Bina, an affair?<eos> Bina!<eos> Walter, would you come with me, please?
It's medicinal, right?<eos> We could open our own ladies' detective agency.<eos> Put Mr. Kepp out of business.<eos> How bad?<eos> Oh, I'd say that I'm due around the same time you are.
Oh, I'd say that I'm due around the same time you are.<eos> So?<eos> What did he say?<eos> He said that I should be in the Woodside ballroom serving hors d'oeuvres because they're understaffed, apparently.<eos> Did you have a chance to ask the thing I sent you over there for?
He said that I should be in the Woodside ballroom serving hors d'oeuvres because they're understaffed, apparently.<eos> Did you have a chance to ask the thing I sent you over there for?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Denny, who's that man there, he said that there's no one registered under the name you asked about.<eos> Did you say the right name?
I am not.<eos> How did you manage to seduce Bina?<eos> Bad timing?<eos> It is bad timing, I realize that now.<eos> If I tell you this, will you stop walking with me?
Francie doesn't even remember me, does she?<eos> Ah, those rotten kids.<eos> What did you ever see in that boy?<eos> I can't even think about it.<eos> What if you came here for a different reason today?
Ah, those rotten kids.<eos> What did you ever see in that boy?<eos> I can't even think about it.<eos> What if you came here for a different reason today?<eos> What if you went away with someone better?
So... Mr. Pfaffler said he's gonna call my mom.<eos> And the girl?<eos> She started to cry.<eos> I think I didn't describe it appealingly.<eos> We'll work on the wording before you try again.
Sure.<eos> We hope it all works out for you.<eos> It'd be great if it did.<eos> Cousin Walter?<eos> I'm glad you could come.
I felt like we weren't even in the same place, you know?<eos> No.<eos> It's the same wedding no matter what table you're at, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm so glad you came over because I was just saying I'm so tired.
I'm so glad you came over because I was just saying I'm so tired.<eos> Gonna head out. Oh. Okay.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay, so...<eos> You look so beautiful.
And this was great.<eos> BYE, guys.<eos> Have a good night.<eos> Hey-<eos> I know I'm probably the last person in the world you ever want to see again.
Hey-<eos> I know I'm probably the last person in the world you ever want to see again.<eos> And I get that.<eos> Totally understand.<eos> And it will probably suck for you to have to see me again under any circumstances which is why I wanted to say that whatever happened between us and however it ended I think, you know, I could be a really good dad, probably, if you'll just...

And it will probably suck for you to have to see me again under any circumstances which is why I wanted to say that whatever happened between us and however it ended I think, you know, I could be a really good dad, probably, if you'll just...<eos> If you'll let me.<eos> So, that's it.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> What are you doing?
If you'll let me.<eos> So, that's it.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I don't know how you fixed this, but it really meant a lot.
Well, it's been so great to catch up with you all.<eos> I hope you all got to dance to your heart's content.<eos> Do you still have the golden bird?<eos> Oh, Nanny Jo.<eos> You don't even remember it, do you?
Do you still have the golden bird?<eos> Oh, Nanny Jo.<eos> You don't even remember it, do you?<eos> No, of course I do.<eos> I don't know why I should be embarrassed about this, but I lost it almost immediately after you gave it to me.
It's crazy!<eos> It is! It so is!<eos> It's crazy!<eos> After everything.<eos> Sweetheart, you're embarrassing yourself!
Shut up, Nikki!<eos> Shut up.<eos> What?<eos> I can't not be in love with you.<eos> You screw up all the time.
It's this perfect screwup!<eos> What?<eos> I don't want to be disappointed by anybody but you!<eos> And I don't want to disappoint anybody but you.<eos> What are you saying?
Doesn't matter, not at all.<eos> I just like being a good detective.<eos> Gives me something.<eos> Well, he never showed up, so it really doesn't matter who.<eos> You know what they say?
I did.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> Neither did I.<eos> And the people we were supposed to become together, they never showed up.<eos> Was there ever a time you would have done that for me?
The Bina I married would never cheat on me.<eos> Well, the Jerry I married...<eos> What?<eos> What?<eos> The Jerry you married what?
Okay?<eos> You deal with it 'cause you have to!<eos> Do you? Yeah, you do!<eos> That's life!<eos> You're ridiculous and a mess!
You deal with it 'cause you have to!<eos> Do you? Yeah, you do!<eos> That's life!<eos> You're ridiculous and a mess!<eos> And you still hope that you'll find someone who'll think that you're okay enough to be loved.
You're ridiculous and a mess!<eos> And you still hope that you'll find someone who'll think that you're okay enough to be loved.<eos> Is that what life is?<eos> Yeah, it is.<eos> And it's really weird that you don't know that by now!
Thank you.<eos> Is it good?<eos> Yeah, really good.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> What did you say?
Oh, shit.<eos> What did you say?<eos> Oh, my Lord!<eos> Holy shit!<eos> What did you say back there?
Oh, my Lord!<eos> Holy shit!<eos> What did you say back there?<eos> It was...<eos> What did you do?
It was...<eos> What did you do?<eos> It was hard to hear, you know, with, like, the wind and Nikki in my ear, and then, when I got on the railing, everybody started shouting.<eos> And then underwater, you can't, like, hear anything underwater.<eos> But it sounded like, you know, you were getting to something good.

Thanks.<eos> Hi.<eos> Please don't slam the door, even for that.<eos> Ringo?<eos> You're gonna make him fat. Oh, yeah, lam.
Ringo?<eos> You're gonna make him fat. Oh, yeah, lam.<eos> Well, We are.<eos> Here you go, Ringo.<eos> Okay, you're sure you didn't forget anybody?
Baby.<eos> Oh, man!<eos> Come on, man.<eos> I know, I'm sorry.<eos> It's just, you know, if you forget the baby... I'm not sure I believe you when you say you didn't forget any of our friends.
Look at this.<eos> Baby cakes.<eos> Talk to the angels.<eos> It's one o'clock in the morning and you're wide awake.
Talk to the angels.<eos> It's one o'clock in the morning and you're wide awake.<eos> I love you.<eos> Bless you.<eos> What do you have to say?
Bless you.<eos> What do you have to say?<eos> There's the monkey.<eos> Mama.<eos> You're going to fast.
There's the monkey.<eos> Mama.<eos> You're going to fast.<eos> Let me see.<eos> Let me see you swim.
Mama.<eos> You're going to fast.<eos> Let me see.<eos> Let me see you swim.<eos> Are you sweeping?
What is that like the third time this week?<eos> Next time it's going out of your paycheck.<eos> Dale, where's my eggs over?<eos> - Right here.<eos> You said up.
- I said easy.<eos> - Give me 5 minutes.<eos> - Well, I don't have 5 minutes.<eos> - I got to get out of here. - Jeez.<eos> Okay, darling. How about you colored it up for your mother. Okay.
I'll get it later.<eos> - Crawfish Friday?<eos> - Crawfish are good.<eos> Just peel the tail back and suck all the juice out the head.<eos> - You suck juice out of the head? - Yeah.
- What?<eos> - Yeah, you just...<eos> Here's a Belgian waffle and bacon.<eos> Where the hash browns?<eos> - You ordered bacon.
- You ordered bacon.<eos> - I want it hash browns.<eos> - Okay, I can get you that. No problem.<eos> - No, he's fine.<eos> - You ordered bacon.
- That's grandma's.<eos> Mom, breakfast!<eos> I can't eat now.<eos> I just took my pills.<eos> You know what, you can have grandma's potatoes.
- Please stop yelling.<eos> - Shut up.<eos> Yeah, yeah, I get it.<eos> But Karla's kid sitting here waiting for her to take him to the park.<eos> Yeah, so you can come in?
Let's go.<eos> Mommy, your turn.<eos> Is daddy coming to the fair?<eos> No, sweetheart.<eos> You're gonna see daddy next weekend.
Mommy, your turn.<eos> Is daddy coming to the fair?<eos> No, sweetheart.<eos> You're gonna see daddy next weekend.<eos> And maybe you'll get to see Cheryl too.
And she's smart.<eos> She's very smart.<eos> - She's gonna be a doctor.<eos> - Yeah, I know.<eos> And I want you to really make friends with her, okay?
Are you friends with her?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I am.<eos> She, daddy and I, we all love somebody like crazy.<eos> - Do you know who that is?
Frankie.<eos> Excuse me, ma'am. Did you see where my little boy was that was right here?<eos> No, I didn't. I'm sorry.<eos> Are you hiding, Frankie?<eos> Frankie. You left your toy.
Pull over!<eos> Come on!<eos> Move!<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> Where are you, sweetheart?
So it's gonna be okay.<eos> I'm gonna write all this down so I don't forget it.<eos> Green Hatchback Ford old 80's. Intersection of Rosemund...<eos> Are you cute.<eos> - You aren't here by yourself, are you?
No, son.<eos> She's out of the car.<eos> She's looking for you.<eos> She's telling everyone she's looking for a little boy named Frankie.<eos> You think that's you?
She said he has curly black hair and his name is Frankie.<eos> I really think that's your mom in the parking lot.<eos> Come on, let's go find her.<eos> Go, she's scared.<eos> She thinks you're lost.
What do you mean?<eos> Look out!<eos> Damnit!<eos> Where's my shells?<eos> You had to keep coming, didn't you?
Terry, are you back?<eos> Terry, was that you on the phone?<eos> Mommy?<eos> Frankie?<eos> Where are you, sweetheart?
Terry, was that you on the phone?<eos> Mommy?<eos> Frankie?<eos> Where are you, sweetheart?<eos> - Where are you, honey?
- Where are you, honey?<eos> - Up here.<eos> - Hi, sweetheart.<eos> - I'm scared.<eos> - Where have you been?
I'm gonna get you down, okay?<eos> - Come up the ladder.<eos> - I can't.<eos> I can't, honey, because the ladder is locked.<eos> So you're gonna have to come down through this hole.
All right, boys. Here we go.<eos> Nice and easy.<eos> Man, Mitch, if you weren't here...
Nice and easy.<eos> Man, Mitch, if you weren't here...<eos> I'm always here.<eos> Don't worry, your friend's gonna be all right.<eos> Are you Batman?
- Come on, Pete.<eos> - Hey, Mitch!<eos> I told you, you don't have to do this every day.<eos> I want to.<eos> You saved my sister's life.
Hey, come on, man, why don't you leave my boys alone, and get off this big wheel and come join me for a run?<eos> What are you saying, that I need to work out?<eos> That I'm, what, looking smaller?<eos> No!<eos> You're looking big.
Jesus.<eos> Hey, what's up, buddy?<eos> - Hey, Mitch.<eos> - Hey, can I see that?<eos> - Where'd you get this?
- But you, you're welcome anytime.<eos> - Thank you very much.<eos> - I'll see you around?<eos> - Yes, you will.<eos> Okay, I get that you have to test for image stabilization, but why'd we have to come to the beach?
- Thank you very much.<eos> - I'll see you around?<eos> - Yes, you will.<eos> Okay, I get that you have to test for image stabilization, but why'd we have to come to the beach?<eos> You know I hate the beach.
- Hi, Dave.<eos> - Nice to meet you.<eos> - C.J. How you doing?<eos> I'm doing all right.<eos> You're trying out today, right?
Well, I'll see you at tryouts.<eos> All right, C.J.<eos> That was amazing to watch.<eos> She came up to you, she was very nice and warm.<eos> And you handled it really smoothly.
- Fuck, no.<eos> That was awkward.<eos> - It was horrible.<eos> - Fuck!<eos> Did you have a stroke?
- Hey, Steph.<eos> - Welcome back.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - Third time's a charm, right?<eos> - Yeah, yeah, you know, I'm...
You need to understand one thing, Zane.<eos> We're a family here.<eos> A team.<eos> And we support each other.<eos> - You're out.
- Come on, I'm...<eos> I'm Zane.<eos> - Get the fuck off my beach.<eos> - Okay. Okay.<eos> So you're going to make me guess your name?
So you're going to make me guess your name?<eos> Are you following me?<eos> I was actually just going to ask you the same thing.<eos> Okay.<eos> Look, you're hot.
I may resist for a while, but we both know eventually I'll give in.<eos> So why don't we just skip that.<eos> Why don't you put a baby in me?<eos> - Now.<eos> - You know, honestly...
Hey, fresh face.<eos> You here for the qualifiers?<eos> No, no, I'm not trying out.<eos> I'm actually already on the team.<eos> You're already on this team?
I'm Matt Brody.<eos> Ready for duty.<eos> "Ready for duty"?<eos> Okay.<eos> You got any papers or anything like that?
- Yeah.<eos> At all.<eos> Yeah, 'cause I don't give a shit.<eos> I legit needed those for my taxes.<eos> What you need is to understand that if you're going to be on this team,
Yeah.<eos> Where you from, One Direction?<eos> Iowa?<eos> - Iowa?<eos> - You heard of it?
My mangina?<eos> So you are being serious.<eos> Dead serious, right now, NSYNC, all right?<eos> This ain't no little fucking pond out of Iowa.<eos> So with all due respect, you want to be here on this team, on our team, you're gonna have to earn it.
Dead serious, right now, NSYNC, all right?<eos> This ain't no little fucking pond out of Iowa.<eos> So with all due respect, you want to be here on this team, on our team, you're gonna have to earn it.<eos> Look, I get it.<eos> You're big, Sasquatch.
His hands were soft and supple though,<eos> - like a woman.<eos> No offense.<eos> - None taken.<eos> You know what, man?
No offense.<eos> - None taken.<eos> You know what, man?<eos> I gotta tell you, I'm feeling really good about this year.<eos> You know what I'm saying?
I gotta tell you, I'm feeling really good about this year.<eos> You know what I'm saying?<eos> Good luck out there, man. Good luck.<eos> Thanks.<eos> And if you need some extra motivation...
My friend is choking!<eos> Help!<eos> No, not C.J. Not C.J. No, no!<eos> Are you okay?<eos> You're choking.
You're choking.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> - Ronnie.<eos> - You're gonna be just fine.
Yeah, yeah.<eos> No, don't touch, don't touch.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm so good.<eos> You did good, good, good work.
Okay.<eos> I'm so good.<eos> You did good, good, good work.<eos> Good job.<eos> Thank you, you can go now.
You don't need to look down there.<eos> Do not touch me right now.<eos> - Not even touching you. - Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Looks like you got your beef and your biscuits stuck down there.
Ronnie, are you okay?<eos> Yeah, no, I'm good.<eos> I'm proud of you, Ronnie.<eos> Fuck you, Dave.<eos> You're my worst friend.
And I'm here to create an opportunity for you.<eos> I'm sure they'll come around.<eos> I'm sure they will, too.<eos> Why does she always look like she's running in slo-mo?<eos> You see it, too?
Right.<eos> She's the reason I believe in God.<eos> Hey, how's your dick?<eos> It's good, you know...<eos> It's better, you know...
- Okay. - Okay.<eos> I got my dick stuck in a chair earlier.<eos> - What? You did?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You haven't heard about this?
Attaboy, Ronnie!<eos> Great job!<eos> Great!<eos> Fuck.<eos> You know, you wanna be on our team, you're gonna have to pass this course.
- "Lieutenant"?<eos> Like in the army?<eos> Let me save you some time.<eos> Okay?<eos> You're not gonna be my big brother here and put me on the right path.
You're not gonna be my big brother here and put me on the right path.<eos> It doesn't work like that.<eos> I got where I am today completely by myself.<eos> So how about you let me do my job, and I'll tell you where to send my checks?<eos> You know, sharks always swim slowly. Until they need to attack.
I got where I am today completely by myself.<eos> So how about you let me do my job, and I'll tell you where to send my checks?<eos> You know, sharks always swim slowly. Until they need to attack.<eos> Thank you for that cryptic and totally irrelevant piece of information.<eos> What are you, Aquaman?
What are you, Aquaman?<eos> 'Cause I'm really confused with what we've been talking about.<eos> Come on, Gold Medal.<eos> You afraid I'm gonna kick your Little Mermaid ass all over this course in front of all these people?<eos> I mean, now you're gonna have to beat me on the big boy's course, princess.
- Yeah?<eos> The problem is, that's not the course.<eos> That's not the course?<eos> So here's what we're gonna do.<eos> We're gonna go over to the real course, and if you beat me over there, not only are you on the team, but I won't fuck with you anymore and I'll call you by your real name.
Yeah!<eos> Refrigerators?<eos> ...98, 99, 100!<eos> That was bullshit, Mitch.<eos> You know I was already gassed.
- Here you go.<eos> Here you go.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Take him.<eos> You're okay.
I made it!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> You don't ever have to thank me.<eos> You did this one on your own.
I made it onto...<eos> Wait.<eos> Do not tell me that I'm the tech guy.<eos> No!<eos> No, I chose you because you have heart, no quit and you leave it all out on the beach.
No, I chose you because you have heart, no quit and you leave it all out on the beach.<eos> - Thanks, Mitch.<eos> - Congratulations.<eos> Hey, High School Musical.<eos> You were reckless out there.
- Thanks, Mitch.<eos> - Congratulations.<eos> Hey, High School Musical.<eos> You were reckless out there.<eos> Completely destroyed a motorcycle, which you stole.
I didn't steal that.<eos> I commandeered it, okay?<eos> Because it was faster and clearly had insurance.<eos> And by the way, the lady that I saved, she didn't seem to mind.<eos> Let me tell you something, man, the rescues don't mean a thing if you put other people in danger.
Because it was faster and clearly had insurance.<eos> And by the way, the lady that I saved, she didn't seem to mind.<eos> Let me tell you something, man, the rescues don't mean a thing if you put other people in danger.<eos> Now, I get it, you're fast, you're fearless.<eos> And I have to make you a trainee, butterfly, but you got a lot to learn.
- See you then.<eos> Let's go, Frankie.<eos> Brody?<eos> - Hey.<eos> - What are you doing?
You know, stargazing.<eos> Under a pier?<eos> Yeah.<eos> That way.<eos> Look, you're on the team, and I don't want anyone on the team sleeping outside, so...
Yeah.<eos> That way.<eos> Look, you're on the team, and I don't want anyone on the team sleeping outside, so...<eos> Yeah, come on.<eos> You're coming with me.
- Come on in.<eos> Just like C.J., always picking up strays.<eos> Quit looking at Little Mitch!<eos> It's creepy.<eos> Come and see where you're gonna crash.
One, two, duck!<eos> Again.<eos> One, two, duck!<eos> Nice!<eos> What you doing there, killer?
What?<eos> Very important lesson.<eos> That is the Devil's Urchin.<eos> One prick out of that thing will give you enough adrenaline to choke out a pissed-off bull.<eos> The only problem is, after that, you say some crazy-ass shit, and then you fucking die.
- Why you, Ted?<eos> Why?<eos> Don't you do this to me, Ted!<eos> Don't you do this!<eos> Okay, no. But, seriously, I got to help you because you are gonna kill someone with that technique.
Okay, no. But, seriously, I got to help you because you are gonna kill someone with that technique.<eos> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> - All right. Okay.<eos> Ready?<eos> Wait, Summer, do you have time to study later?
- All right. Okay.<eos> Ready?<eos> Wait, Summer, do you have time to study later?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Did you just look at my boobs?
Yeah.<eos> Did you just look at my boobs?<eos> I... Was not my intention.<eos> I didn't stare directly at them.<eos> You're looking at them right now.
I... Was not my intention.<eos> I didn't stare directly at them.<eos> You're looking at them right now.<eos> Now I did.<eos> 'Cause you're talking about them.
If it's gonna be a problem for you...<eos> There's not a problem for me.<eos> - At all.<eos> Cool. - Yeah.<eos> All right. You just looked at them again.
Cool. - Yeah.<eos> All right. You just looked at them again.<eos> - No, I didn't. I was... I didn't...<eos> - Yeah, you did.<eos> Well, when you point them out like that...
All right. You just looked at them again.<eos> - No, I didn't. I was... I didn't...<eos> - Yeah, you did.<eos> Well, when you point them out like that...<eos> It's a compliment if you think about it, sort of.
He's a man of action.<eos> - There's a purity to that.<eos> - I'm going to kill you.<eos> Damn it.<eos> You do that every time.
- There's a purity to that.<eos> - I'm going to kill you.<eos> Damn it.<eos> You do that every time.<eos> I build you up, and then you ruin the mystique.
- I'm going to kill you.<eos> Damn it.<eos> You do that every time.<eos> I build you up, and then you ruin the mystique.<eos> - See something you like?
I build you up, and then you ruin the mystique.<eos> - See something you like?<eos> - Jesus Christ.<eos> You...<eos> You got me.
- See something you like?<eos> - Jesus Christ.<eos> You...<eos> You got me.<eos> You're gonna be cool and go talk to her like a real man, or you gonna stand up here and be Creepy Creeperton through the binoculars?
- Come on. Let's go.<eos> - I'm coming!<eos> - If you're comin', hurry up.<eos> - Where's mine?<eos> You don't get one.
- If you're comin', hurry up.<eos> - Where's mine?<eos> You don't get one.<eos> Come on. Quit screwing around!<eos> - Could you wait for me?
- Could you wait for me?<eos> - Come on.<eos> God damn it, let's go.<eos> Go, go, go!<eos> Lock your arms around my waist or you're gonna fucking fall off again!
Go, go, go!<eos> Lock your arms around my waist or you're gonna fucking fall off again!<eos> - This is so awkward, dude.<eos> - Hold on. Hold on.<eos> How many buckets of lotion do you wear a day?
There's too much fire!<eos> No way.<eos> C.J.!<eos> Okay, guapo.<eos> If you want me, you can have me.
Can you help me?<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Are you hurt?<eos> Brody!<eos> Are you okay?
Are you hurt?<eos> Brody!<eos> Are you okay?<eos> That was such a great plan, just to see fire and just swim right into it.<eos> You care about me.
Is he going to be okay?<eos> Do you know what happened to the Councilman?<eos> No, I don't know.<eos> We were partying, and then when we came upstairs, the boat was already on fire.<eos> You disobeyed an order out there, put yourself in danger.
Do you know what happened to the Councilman?<eos> No, I don't know.<eos> We were partying, and then when we came upstairs, the boat was already on fire.<eos> You disobeyed an order out there, put yourself in danger.<eos> You can't save anyone if you die.
Get back right now.<eos> Do not contaminate my crime scene.<eos> Come on, Ellerbee.<eos> Don't give me any of that jurisdiction shit.<eos> No, I won't, because technically, you don't have a jurisdiction, lifeguard.
Hey, how do I keep in touch?<eos> Seashell phone, or do I just blow into the conch and you appear?<eos> That's the spirit, Ellerbee.<eos> Just call me on the shell phone. That's all you gotta do.<eos> I'll tell you this, if you crack this case, they're gonna upgrade you to a Segway and they're gonna give you big-boy pants to wear, cover up those chicken legs.
- Damn, Ronnie.<eos> - C.J.!<eos> Please!<eos> Shit.<eos> I never really heard a guy sing that song, but you're really good.
Please!<eos> Shit.<eos> I never really heard a guy sing that song, but you're really good.<eos> Thank you.<eos> C.J., what are you doing here?
Coed, cool.<eos> Cool, cool, cool.<eos> Yeah, coed is cool with me, 'cause I'm cool with the coeds.<eos> I'm taking lunch orders.<eos> Do you want anything?
Yeah, coed is cool with me, 'cause I'm cool with the coeds.<eos> I'm taking lunch orders.<eos> Do you want anything?<eos> I would like a salad.<eos> You sure?
A guy died.<eos> Maybe this is why we keep losing recruits.<eos> - They can't handle it.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I mean, now that you know our job is much more than you expected, right, the stakes are higher.
- They can't handle it.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I mean, now that you know our job is much more than you expected, right, the stakes are higher.<eos> What happened today, while very tragic, unfortunately, it does happen.<eos> So if you want to quit, hey, we totally get it.
- Yeah.<eos> I mean, now that you know our job is much more than you expected, right, the stakes are higher.<eos> What happened today, while very tragic, unfortunately, it does happen.<eos> So if you want to quit, hey, we totally get it.<eos> But if you don't and you choose to stay, just know that Baywatch is more than a job.
So, this, technically, has nothing to do with us.<eos> You just heard that cop.<eos> He just told us that.<eos> I just thought you had to be on a really restrictive diet to look like you guys.<eos> Brody, what is it that you think we do here at Baywatch?
How about sand grifters running a con on the beach, right?<eos> Well, I'm not exactly sure what a sand grifter is, Stephanie.<eos> But I would probably call the cops.<eos> Sand grifters are beach thieves.<eos> Okay, so while you're working on your tan, they're stealing things from families on the beach.
So my gut says that it's all connected.<eos> Wait, Leeds did say there'd be an open house tonight, right?<eos> Yes, she did.<eos> And we're all going.<eos> What'd you find on Chen?
All his money is tied up in real estate in the bay.<eos> Well, I guess you'll have to help me persuade him some other way.<eos> Every man has a price.<eos> Speaking of which, I know you've been using my special set of skills for your own nefarious purposes, but additional compensation would go a long way in motivating me to keep my mouth shut.<eos> You're blackmailing me.
Do we have a deal, or...<eos> I need some closure.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hi.<eos> You look really nice.
Hey, you look really nice, too, Baby Gap.<eos> That shirt come in big-boy size?<eos> Well, at least I'm undercover.<eos> Look at you.<eos> You didn't even try.
I'm just saying it's not rocket science.<eos> Okay, troubled youth.<eos> Thank you for that.<eos> The only way this whole thing is gonna work out is if everyone, everyone, does their job.<eos> - Can you handle that, Malibu Ken?
I am not interested in selling my properties.<eos> Why don't you think about it, okay?<eos> I of all people know how hard it is to run a business.<eos> You never know when a dry spell could come.<eos> What are you thinking?
I can't have this unraveling.<eos> Got it?<eos> Now go clean up your mess.<eos> Brody.<eos> I'm so glad you came.
Greg, the good stuff.<eos> - Scotch is your drink, right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> This is a really nice place you have here.<eos> You have great taste.
Don't you think?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Here.<eos> Keep the whole bottle.<eos> I think you need it.
I think you need it.<eos> - This'll be fun.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Hey.<eos> Did you get any intel on Leeds?
And it's fucking delicious.<eos> All right, I think I got something.<eos> Found our access point.<eos> Where is Brody?<eos> Have you seen him?
Have you seen him?<eos> No. No time.<eos> We gotta move without him.<eos> Yeah, but we need our lookout.<eos> What's your deal? You like torturing guys?
What's your deal? You like torturing guys?<eos> - No.<eos> - Yeah, you do.<eos> Well, I mean, I have three brothers, so I've had a lot of practice.<eos> I take it you're an only child.
- Yeah, you do.<eos> Well, I mean, I have three brothers, so I've had a lot of practice.<eos> I take it you're an only child.<eos> I don't know, honestly.<eos> You don't know?
I mean, I've always wondered what happened that night.<eos> I knew the relay was the next day, but those guys...<eos> They didn't care about me.<eos> They just needed me to win.<eos> Well, you certainly made sure they did not win.
Okay? I lost all my sponsors.<eos> I'm an Olympic champion and I'm fucking broke.<eos> - Ronnie, hey.<eos> - What?<eos> Okay, listen. I need you to create a distraction for Leeds.
- God damn it, Ronnie.<eos> You listen to me, and you listen good.<eos> Every team has a ringer, and you and only you are my ringer.<eos> Well, then I guess I'm your ringer.<eos> You are my goddamn ringer.
Yeah.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Could I...<eos> Will you just have one drink with me?<eos> You should probably actually stop drinking because you're supposed to be the lookout for Mitch.
You can't blame me, right?<eos> So juvenile.<eos> I'm onto you all.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, put your hands together for whatever that was.<eos> You did good, Ronnie.
So juvenile.<eos> I'm onto you all.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, put your hands together for whatever that was.<eos> You did good, Ronnie.<eos> Where'd you learn to dance like that?
You did good, Ronnie.<eos> Where'd you learn to dance like that?<eos> Hebrew school.<eos> You were supposed to be there for us tonight.<eos> You had a job to do.
You had a job to do.<eos> And now you're trashed.<eos> See, I just...<eos> I don't understand this, man.<eos> If you really think that there's drugs here, call the police.
If you really think that there's drugs here, call the police.<eos> And then what?<eos> We get a few minnows?<eos> The big whale gets away?<eos> Do you hear yourself when you talk?
Do you hear yourself when you talk?<eos> I dare you to say one thing without the ocean in it.<eos> I dare you.<eos> We were depending on you tonight.<eos> And you fucked up...
Again.<eos> Watch yourself.<eos> Really?<eos> Get this through your head, Mitch.<eos> You're not a cop.
Watch yourself.<eos> Really?<eos> Get this through your head, Mitch.<eos> You're not a cop.<eos> You're not the fucking Equalizer.
Really?<eos> Get this through your head, Mitch.<eos> You're not a cop.<eos> You're not the fucking Equalizer.<eos> You're a lifeguard, Mitch, who sits in his fucking tower all day, 'cause that's the only place he has any sort of power.
Come on.<eos> Don't fucking touch me.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> - Or what?<eos> What're you gonna do, Mitch?
I think we both said a few things last night that we didn't mean.<eos> Not me.<eos> I meant every word.<eos> Come on, man.<eos> You've never gotten drunk and said something you don't mean?
I fucked up, man.<eos> I know that.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I watched you win two gold medals.<eos> You were amazing when it was just you.
I know that.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I watched you win two gold medals.<eos> You were amazing when it was just you.<eos> But when it came to the relay, being part of your team, your Olympic team, your family, you blew it. 'Cause you're selfish.
You were amazing when it was just you.<eos> But when it came to the relay, being part of your team, your Olympic team, your family, you blew it. 'Cause you're selfish.<eos> Baywatch is our team. Baywatch is our family.<eos> These are the keys to our house.<eos> But you've proven to me that you don't want to be part of this family.
These are the keys to our house.<eos> But you've proven to me that you don't want to be part of this family.<eos> So you're done.<eos> 'Cause the only thing you give a shit about is yourself and your medals.<eos> You talking 'bout this medal?
So you're done.<eos> 'Cause the only thing you give a shit about is yourself and your medals.<eos> You talking 'bout this medal?<eos> That's really impressive.<eos> Don't you have two of them, though?
Listen, Mitch, I know I messed up, okay?<eos> I should have listened.<eos> I want to be a part of this team.<eos> And I will not let you down again, I swear.<eos> And by the way, I think you're right about Leeds.
And the coroner's office just released his body.<eos> And I got a plan.<eos> Guys, I still don't understand what part of the plan this is.<eos> - Just go with the flow, Brody.<eos> - Yeah, you were in a very bad accident.
Why was it my fault?<eos> Come on, guys.<eos> I need a bigger coat.<eos> There's no coat in here that's gonna fit you.<eos> - You got a better idea?
I need a bigger coat.<eos> There's no coat in here that's gonna fit you.<eos> - You got a better idea?<eos> - I think I do.<eos> But you're not gonna like it.
Come on, let's go.<eos> Okay, left turn, left turn.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Who taught you how to drive, Stevie fucking Wonder?<eos> You're huge, man.
McDreamy, get over here. I need you to help me.<eos> Oh, God, what?<eos> Dude.<eos> I need you to check his taint for needle marks.<eos> You want me to check his taint?
Lift his ball sac and check for anything unusual.<eos> There's... Fuck.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> - Dude, it's a taint, man, it's a taint.<eos> - You didn't even look.
It's just a handful of ball sac.<eos> It's disgusting.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Dude, I can't take you seriously when the dick is out.<eos> Can you please just cover the dick?
This was a bad idea.<eos> Stop being a baby.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Shut your mouth.<eos> You're gonna get us caught.
I'm laying on a dead old lady.<eos> Well, she's not going to bite you, for Christ's sakes.<eos> - Will you shut up?<eos> - Our drawers are empty.<eos> Why'd you pick that drawer?
Why'd you pick that drawer?<eos> I'm the only one with a body in my drawer?<eos> Shut up!<eos> She smells like cheese toast and chowder.<eos> Holy Christ. You just tickled another man's taint.
- Nothing's dripping on me.<eos> - Listen to me.<eos> Formaldehyde melts fat.<eos> That's what's dripping on your face, necrotic liquid fat.<eos> Now will you shut the fuck up?
- Listen to me.<eos> Formaldehyde melts fat.<eos> That's what's dripping on your face, necrotic liquid fat.<eos> Now will you shut the fuck up?<eos> What the fuck did you just say?
Rodriguez.<eos> It is him.<eos> You got the fake files?<eos> Relax.<eos> We're only here 'cause you broke his fucking neck.
- Mitch, hold up.<eos> Check this out.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> That's a very nice scooter.<eos> Have you ever seen the Olympics?
Check this out.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> That's a very nice scooter.<eos> Have you ever seen the Olympics?<eos> - Why are you grabbing me so tight?
Excuse me.<eos> That's a very nice scooter.<eos> Have you ever seen the Olympics?<eos> - Why are you grabbing me so tight?<eos> - Why the fuck are you driving?
They're right there!<eos> - Watch it, watch it!<eos> - Shut up!<eos> You got a beautiful border collie right there. Don't hit him!<eos> You do not respect anything.
Go get them.<eos> Stay on the pathway.<eos> You get the white one.<eos> All right.<eos> You're just slowing me down, anyway.
I'm gonna need that phone.<eos> This phone?<eos> Whoops.<eos> Fuck your phone.<eos> You're going night-night, bitch.
Wait!<eos> Hey, hey.<eos> No baby pictures.<eos> - Have some class.<eos> - You're right.
Except for there's no fucking such thing as "lifeguard pursuit"!<eos> Police do pursuits!<eos> When you do it, it's just some guys chasing some other guys.<eos> - No offense. - None taken.<eos> Hey, what are you saying?
Police do pursuits!<eos> When you do it, it's just some guys chasing some other guys.<eos> - No offense. - None taken.<eos> Hey, what are you saying?<eos> You're just gonna let those guys walk?
You're just gonna let those guys walk?<eos> Okay, how do I explain this so that you people understand?<eos> "You people"?<eos> "You people"?<eos> You don't get to say that.
Okay, how do I explain this so that you people understand?<eos> "You people"?<eos> "You people"?<eos> You don't get to say that.<eos> You're just tan.
- Come on, brother.<eos> Look, even if you were police, which you're not, and even if this was your jurisdiction, which it isn't, and even if you had probable cause to pursue, which you definitely don't,<eos> what you did would still be totally illegal.<eos> Okay, well, I mean, it's a good thing we're not police, then.<eos> It's like you purposely only hear 1% of what I say.
- Splish, splash.<eos> - Otherwise, I'll fire you.<eos> Now I gotta go clean up this mess that you made.<eos> Obviously, you have every reason to be upset, and I apologize.<eos> So, do you always do the opposite of what people ask you to do?
They're the ones who supply all the fish to the Huntley Club, right?<eos> - So?<eos> - So the question is, who the fuck is Angelo?<eos> I saw barrels like that down in the Huntley, and now they're on the back of her yacht.<eos> Oh, my God. Mitch, you're impossible.
Check it out.<eos> I'm undercover.<eos> Yeah.<eos> A little too undercover.<eos> Why the fuck are you wearing makeup, dude?
Well, what we're supposed to do is find the fucking flakka.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - Angelo's Fish Company.<eos> There it is.<eos> You are so selfish.
That takes balls.<eos> Holy shit.<eos> It's like Breaking Bad in there.<eos> Yeah, dude, Breaking Bad.<eos> - You were right.
Ellerbee, you got to get down to the Huntley ASAP.<eos> We found the drugs.<eos> Yeah, that sounds great, Mitch, but right now I'm busy dealing with another dead body.<eos> Oh, and this one's on your beach.<eos> Did you hear that?
You're done.<eos> I want you off the beach.<eos> I'm putting Brody in charge.<eos> No way.<eos> - There's not a chance... Hey... - You can do this in your sleep.
- There's not a chance... Hey... - You can do this in your sleep.<eos> That's not what I'm saying.<eos> I don't want the position.<eos> I don't...<eos> You have two gold medals, okay?
That's not what I'm saying.<eos> I don't want the position.<eos> I don't...<eos> You have two gold medals, okay?<eos> You're like the Stephen Hawking of swimming, minus the total paralysis part.
I don't want the position.<eos> I don't...<eos> You have two gold medals, okay?<eos> You're like the Stephen Hawking of swimming, minus the total paralysis part.<eos> Unless you want me to replace you with someone else.
Dismissed.<eos> Brody.<eos> Brody, hang back.<eos> Okay, it's just me and you now.<eos> If you can help me keep your new pals in line, I can make sure that you stick around here for a long, long time.
If you can help me keep your new pals in line, I can make sure that you stick around here for a long, long time.<eos> And if you don't, your probation could get fucked up.<eos> - Good talk, Brody.<eos> - Okay.<eos> You're my dawg, right?
- What?<eos> If anyone should get the job it should be Stephanie.<eos> No shit.<eos> I couldn't agree more.<eos> What would you have done?
Please call us back.<eos> We're worried about you.<eos> No, thanks, man.<eos> Yo, Mitch. It's Brody.<eos> I hit you on the C.B., so I know you're listening.
We're worried about you.<eos> No, thanks, man.<eos> Yo, Mitch. It's Brody.<eos> I hit you on the C.B., so I know you're listening.<eos> I hope you haven't gone crazy and started eating carbs or something.
...you gotta have that.<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> Samsung has all the capabilities of the I.T. process, and...<eos> Mind if I cut in for a second?<eos> What are you doing here?
Yeah, sure.<eos> Samsung has all the capabilities of the I.T. process, and...<eos> Mind if I cut in for a second?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I'm here to remind you who you are.
I'm here to remind you who you are.<eos> Come on, buddy.<eos> Snap out of it!<eos> Shoes?<eos> You're wearing worker man shoes?
Come on, buddy.<eos> Snap out of it!<eos> Shoes?<eos> You're wearing worker man shoes?<eos> Really, how far have you fallen?
- I'd love to buy a...<eos> - Mitch?<eos> - Yes, Mitch.<eos> Come on, man.<eos> You don't just protect the bay.
- Mitch?<eos> - Yes, Mitch.<eos> Come on, man.<eos> You don't just protect the bay.<eos> You are the bay.
Sand grifters.<eos> Get the fuck out of here!<eos> This is my beach!<eos> All right, we're out of here!<eos> Did you see that?
Black market organs from the Boogie Board Bandits?<eos> You mean this?<eos> No, no.<eos> This is actually for you.<eos> You see, I'm not Mitch, right?
It's your cheat day.<eos> Exactly.<eos> And by the way, I went ahead and added that extra protein for you, dawg.<eos> My man.<eos> - I know you're trying to keep up.
Come on, Summer.<eos> I think I found something big here, okay?<eos> I really need your help.<eos> Please?<eos> - You took marine biology, right?
Please?<eos> - You took marine biology, right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Look at these.<eos> Tell me what you think.
Oh, my God, that's Dave!<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - What?<eos> Hey, stop looking at the picture, dude.<eos> Ronnie, Ronnie, what did you just say?
- Who's Dave?<eos> I used to work with him.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> Doing what? - Tech stuff.<eos> - You wouldn't understand.
- Okay, fine.<eos> - We really appreciate it.<eos> Because as much as I know about laptops, I don't know shit about computers.<eos> So Dave had access to Leeds's server.<eos> Her server, you mean her network.
So we just take a flash drive and we plug it in, you know.<eos> Get into her cloud and then steal all her cookies, right?<eos> And then we're...<eos> Straight through the firewall.<eos> Literally none of what you said made any sense.
Literally none of what you said made any sense.<eos> Straight over the firewall.<eos> It's not like a physical thing you do.<eos> Okay, I don't know what I'm talking about here, dude.<eos> - Just... Can you do it?
What the hell are we supposed to do with dirt, Ronnie?<eos> I meant evidence.<eos> - Evidence.<eos> - Evidence.<eos> Well, why didn't you say so, man?
- Evidence.<eos> - Evidence.<eos> Well, why didn't you say so, man?<eos> - Heck, yeah!<eos> - Thank God you're pretty.
But there was one holdout.<eos> - Who?<eos> - Chen.<eos> And if anything happens to him, his property goes back to the city.<eos> Who do you think they're gonna sell it to?
Victoria, we wanted to come here in person and tell you how excited we are to be working with you instead of against you, now that...<eos> - Now that...<eos> - Mitch is gone.<eos> He's gone, so all we care about now is protecting the bay.<eos> And we know you feel the same.
And we know you feel the same.<eos> I do.<eos> I always knew I liked you two.<eos> - Enjoy the party.<eos> - You look amazing, by the way.
- Enjoy the party.<eos> - You look amazing, by the way.<eos> Well, someone has to.<eos> What?<eos> What are you wearing?
Okay, well, militaries use it all over the world.<eos> But I'll tell him 2100.<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> I'll bet Lurch over here knows where Chen is.<eos> Mitch, if you can hear me, you were right.
- Oh, my God. - Let's go.<eos> Come on.<eos> Wakey-wakey, pretty little dum-dum.<eos> Such a shame.<eos> Why'd you have to go snooping?
Maybe Thorpe was wrong about you after all.<eos> What?<eos> Thorpe?<eos> What are you talking about, "Thorpe"?<eos> You haven't figured that part out yet.
Thorpe?<eos> What are you talking about, "Thorpe"?<eos> You haven't figured that part out yet.<eos> Where I bribed him, you know, got Mitch fired, put your dumb ass in charge.<eos> All you had to do was be a lifeguard.
You haven't figured that part out yet.<eos> Where I bribed him, you know, got Mitch fired, put your dumb ass in charge.<eos> All you had to do was be a lifeguard.<eos> Get a tan.<eos> But instead, you tried to be like Mitch and save the bay.
Where I bribed him, you know, got Mitch fired, put your dumb ass in charge.<eos> All you had to do was be a lifeguard.<eos> Get a tan.<eos> But instead, you tried to be like Mitch and save the bay.<eos> Now let's see how long you can hold your breath.
Fuck!<eos> No!<eos> You have to listen to me!<eos> You're fucking crazy.<eos> If I was a man, you'd call me "driven."
Come on, buddy.<eos> How?<eos> Watch and learn.<eos> Ronnie, come in.<eos> Holy shit, Mitch, you got him!
Holy shit, Mitch, you got him!<eos> Yeah, he's alive and he's well.<eos> Ronnie, I need you to figure out a way to launch those fireworks.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> I want you to light up the sky.
I've never seen any interface like this.<eos> I don't know what to fucking do!<eos> Hey!<eos> Look at me, look at me, look at me!<eos> You are the tech guy.
I don't know what to fucking do!<eos> Hey!<eos> Look at me, look at me, look at me!<eos> You are the tech guy.<eos> You are the motherfucking tech guy.
- Because of you.<eos> - Of course because of me.<eos> You do realize I'm holding a gun, right?<eos> So impulsive.<eos> That's why you walked right into my plan.
So impulsive.<eos> That's why you walked right into my plan.<eos> Leeds!<eos> For fuck's sake.<eos> Why don't you die already?
Until then...<eos> Go, baby.<eos> I'm oceanic, motherfucker.<eos> How tacky.<eos> - Mitch, you just blew her up!
How tacky.<eos> - Mitch, you just blew her up!<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Plus I'm high as a motherfucker right now on Devil's Urchin.<eos> You stabbed yourself with one of those?
- What? - God, why do I keep looking?<eos> What took you so long with Leeds?<eos> I didn't want to make it seem like it was too easy.<eos> The adrenaline kept you alive.<eos> Thank God you make us carry these.
What took you so long with Leeds?<eos> I didn't want to make it seem like it was too easy.<eos> The adrenaline kept you alive.<eos> Thank God you make us carry these.<eos> You saved your own life this time.
You saved your own life this time.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Hey...<eos> So I hear you were... You were right the whole time.
I owe you an apology.<eos> Owe you an apology.<eos> No apology needed.<eos> I mean, we saved the bay.<eos> So you can hit us on that shell phone anytime.
Oh, my God.<eos> This is our beach, bitch.<eos> And you're under arrest.<eos> That was a badass right cross, Brody.<eos> You just said my real name.
Hey, killer.<eos> Hey.<eos> - Morning.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> Do you want breakfast?
- Yeah.<eos> - Bacon? - Yeah.<eos> Cinnabon?<eos> - I saw you do that.<eos> - You're still there.
Oh, my God.<eos> We're late.<eos> We have to go. Come on.<eos> I found something.<eos> - How'd you get this?
We have to go. Come on.<eos> I found something.<eos> - How'd you get this?<eos> - Well, it washed up on shore.<eos> You only threw it eight feet, dude.
Which is impossible, but it'd be so cool.<eos> What?<eos> Okay, I got this.<eos> - Come on, dude.<eos> Hurry up. - Fuck, how'd you do that?
God, it's getting really fro-y in here.<eos> Smile.<eos> Love your chest, it is so...<eos> I like your chest as well.<eos> It doesn't work when you say it back to me like that.
I like your chest as well.<eos> It doesn't work when you say it back to me like that.<eos> Hey, C.J., why do our suits ride so far up our asses?<eos> It makes us faster in the water.<eos> Did you just...
All right.<eos> I'd love it if you wore tighter pants.<eos> I really would.<eos> Why do you get to play Mitch Buchannon?<eos> You're joking.
If you're like me, you wake up 24 minutes and 47 seconds before your best friend is supposed to be picking you up.<eos> If you're like me, your last day starts like this.<eos> Well, I'll let you know by noon.<eos> Well, I can't organize a playdate before...<eos> You want something to eat?
I'm gonna try not to be depressed because I'm single on Cupid Day.<eos> That's Valentine's Day to you!<eos> Do you have insomnia or something, Linds?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> It's just cute that you get up before us and get breakfast. Ooh.
He said, "I made my bed for you."<eos> That is so sweet.<eos> Yes.<eos> No glove, no love.<eos> You hear me?
Lindsay!<eos> All right.<eos> I'm sorry. We're fine.<eos> We're fine.<eos> You're crazy!
We're freakin' fine.<eos> Go ahead and say we're through.<eos> I don't care, I'll just get another you<eos> I'll get another dude that look like you<eos> I don't need you and you don't need me.
I don't care, I'll just get another you<eos> I'll get another dude that look like you<eos> I don't need you and you don't need me.<eos> Give me back my house key.<eos> You can leave it with my new boyfriend.
I'll get another dude that look like you<eos> I don't need you and you don't need me.<eos> Give me back my house key.<eos> You can leave it with my new boyfriend.<eos> You can leave it on the back back, back porch
I don't need you and you don't need me.<eos> Give me back my house key.<eos> You can leave it with my new boyfriend.<eos> You can leave it on the back back, back porch<eos> I don't care, when you leave it leave a message.
Give me back my house key.<eos> You can leave it with my new boyfriend.<eos> You can leave it on the back back, back porch<eos> I don't care, when you leave it leave a message.<eos> You used to never get the message.
Yeah, she's talkin' shit.<eos> Go ahead and say we're through.<eos> I don't care I'll just get another you<eos> I'll get another dude that look like you<eos> I don't need you and you don't need me.
I'd be happy with 15.<eos> I'm not ashamed to admit it.<eos> Last year, Matt literally sent me a dozen red roses.<eos> Matt, oh, come on.<eos> You just spent a whole week crying in the same pair of sweatpants and it got dark.
Last year, Matt literally sent me a dozen red roses.<eos> Matt, oh, come on.<eos> You just spent a whole week crying in the same pair of sweatpants and it got dark.<eos> We're not going back there.<eos> No, I've told you a thousand times, I'll say it again, you do not need that loser.
Hey.<eos> Man.<eos> Sam, hey.<eos> Hi.<eos> Did you like it?
Did you like it?<eos> Like what?<eos> Hey, so, um, big party tonight.<eos> Mom is going out of town.<eos> A huge rager, you know.
I don't know what my plans are, like, what everyone else ends up doing...<eos> So I'll see you tonight.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Yeah?<eos> You know the address.
You know the address.<eos> No. Kent...<eos> Smooth.<eos> Did you guys hear about Anna?<eos> You mean bull dyke.
See?<eos> What?<eos> This is why I deserve some public recognition, for making shit like that happen.<eos> Maybe someone should give me a ribbon.<eos> Like the ones that you used to have hanging on your wall,
It wasn't a YouTube tutorial, so you guys wouldn't get it anyway. Owie!<eos> Samantha Kingston.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hey, Rob.<eos> Did you get my rose?
Who are these ones from?<eos> Your competition.<eos> I want to see.<eos> Oh, Sam has no competition, Rob.<eos> You know it.
I want to see.<eos> Oh, Sam has no competition, Rob.<eos> You know it.<eos> Okay. Well, neither do I, so I guess we're perfect for each other.<eos> So you're going to that thing at Kent's tonight?
Oh, you guys!<eos> Tonight our widdle Sammy passes into womanhood.<eos> I am so proud.<eos> Shh! Stop it.<eos> I hope you shaved.
"Maybe next year, but probably not."<eos> That's it, guys!<eos> Go, girl.<eos> I love it!<eos> It kinda looks like you put it on your cheeks.
How drunk are you?<eos> I'm not drunk.<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> Know what?<eos> You're the hottest girl in here.
Know what?<eos> You're the hottest girl in here.<eos> The hottest.<eos> Okay, look, I'm only gonna be here like an hour, an hour tops.<eos> You know?
You're the hottest girl in here.<eos> The hottest.<eos> Okay, look, I'm only gonna be here like an hour, an hour tops.<eos> You know?<eos> You text me and we'll go.
Baes!<eos> Bae!<eos> Come on.<eos> Oh, get in here, baby!<eos> Patrick, will you go get me something a little bit stronger than this beer?
What's she doing here?<eos> Up. Okay.<eos> Hello, sweetie.<eos> Is that your first drink?<eos> You really should take it easy.
Is that your first drink?<eos> You really should take it easy.<eos> You're a bitch!<eos> Excuse me?<eos> You heard me.
- You're a bitch, too. - What?<eos> You're a drunk.<eos> And you...<eos> You're just pathetic.<eos> You know what?
Psycho!<eos> Psycho!<eos> Get this bitch on a leash!<eos> Psycho!<eos> You wanna go?
In front of everybody.<eos> So you attack her? Okay.<eos> This is not my fault!<eos> You gang up and pour beer all over her?<eos> You know what...
So you attack her? Okay.<eos> This is not my fault!<eos> You gang up and pour beer all over her?<eos> You know what...<eos> Who are you? Come on...
You know what...<eos> Who are you? Come on...<eos> Do not touch me.<eos> You know, your boyfriend's throwing up in my sink.<eos> So, you wanna take care of that?
Pacific Northwest, my ass.<eos> I hate this weather.<eos> Do you guys wanna get some food?<eos> I really need carbs.<eos> You sound like my grandmother.
She freaked me out.<eos> Sam, you're 20 minutes late!<eos> Let's shake it, sister!<eos> Sammy, you like the bird I made you?<eos> Mommy says you have to get up.
Mommy, Sammy won't get up!<eos> Don't make me come up there.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Sexy lady!<eos> What are you doing?
Nice tits!<eos> Ooh.<eos> I have your present.<eos> No glove, no love.<eos> You hear me?
Yo, Sam.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> Sam, you forgot this one.<eos> No, I didn't forget it.<eos> What do you mean?
Oh, man.<eos> Sam, you forgot this one.<eos> No, I didn't forget it.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> The more roses you get on Cupid Day, the more popular you are, right?
Well, I didn't say the rose was from me.<eos> But it is from you, right?<eos> Well...<eos> Anyway, my mom is out of town...<eos> Out of town and you're having a party?
Well...<eos> Anyway, my mom is out of town...<eos> Out of town and you're having a party?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Do you wanna come?
Well, see you tonight?<eos> Or...<eos> Are you nervous?<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> You don't want to waste the first night you go full womanhood.
Are you nervous?<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> You don't want to waste the first night you go full womanhood.<eos> Okay, you sure they look good?<eos> I just really don't want to look like I'm trying too hard, you know?
You're a drunk.<eos> And you...<eos> You're just pathetic.<eos> Juliet...<eos> You know what?
Freak, get out of here!<eos> Get the fuck out!<eos> Get this bitch on a leash!<eos> Psycho!<eos> Psycho. You wanna go?
It really happened.<eos> Again.<eos> Sammy, you like the bird I made you?<eos> It's origami.<eos> Mommy says you have to get up.
Let go!<eos> Mommy, Sammy won't get up!<eos> It wasn't until then that I allowed myself to think the worst.<eos> Sam?<eos> What's this about you feeling sick?
I just don't feel good.<eos> On Cupid Day?<eos> Did something happen?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Did you and Rob have a fight?
Please don't use that tone.<eos> I'm just trying to help.<eos> I just need to sleep a little bit longer.<eos> Please?<eos> Okay. Well, I'll let Lindsay know that you're going in late.
But I have to be at work by 10:00.<eos> Thank you for driving me.<eos> Sure.<eos> Sammy... Hmm.<eos> You'll feel better once you see some of your roses.
"L-U-V ya.<eos> Luv ya."<eos> What is that?<eos> We've been going out since last year.<eos> Yeah. Well, you know, maybe he's just waiting to say it, like, tonight.
I just, bottom line, don't want to have to deal with that today.<eos> Okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> All right.<eos> What are you doing?
Remember Mellow Yellow in the fifth grade?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> When Lindsay found out that she peed in her sleeping bag on the Girl Scout trip.<eos> Why do you care all of a sudden?<eos> You know she should be institutionalized.
I know I'm not wearing the appropriate attire, but I promise they're legitimate.<eos> Cool.<eos> Also, uh, this rose came for you.<eos> It's kind of like a painting of a rose.<eos> You know, it stands out in front of all the others.
So...<eos> By the way, my mom is out of town this weekend, so I'm gonna throw a big party tonight.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Did you remember the address?<eos> Or do you...
Yeah.<eos> Did you remember the address?<eos> Or do you...<eos> Hey, Sam.<eos> It was third grade, so you probably don't remember.
Did you remember the address?<eos> Or do you...<eos> Hey, Sam.<eos> It was third grade, so you probably don't remember.<eos> But do you, uh...
Or do you...<eos> Hey, Sam.<eos> It was third grade, so you probably don't remember.<eos> But do you, uh...<eos> You think you'll come?
You kiss that?<eos> I can't believe you made this ice cream, Ally.<eos> It's literally better than a restaurant's.<eos> No, it's true.<eos> I mean, you should go to cooking school.
It has no dairy.<eos> Oh, you're so full of shit.<eos> Thirty-eight.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - You can shut up now.
- Okay.<eos> - You can shut up now.<eos> What?<eos> Matt's at the party.<eos> Ally, you say "Matt" one more time and I will kill you in your sleep.
How totally insane.<eos> Could our rose have something to do with it?<eos> Don't be stupid.<eos> God, imagine how her family feels.<eos> Look, you can't be mean to someone forever and then just feel badly when they die, okay?
God, imagine how her family feels.<eos> Look, you can't be mean to someone forever and then just feel badly when they die, okay?<eos> We all knew she was crazy.<eos> God, Lindsay, she was your best friend in fifth grade.<eos> Yeah, I remember you used to sleep over at her house.
I'm going to sleep in my room.<eos> I'm going with her.<eos> You were friends with Juliet?<eos> No one even talked to you in fifth grade, and I don't hold that against you.<eos> You never said anything.
Then I woke up this mornin'.<eos> The day starts and ends the same, regardless of anything I do or say.<eos> If that's how it works,<eos> I'm gonna do and say whatever I want.<eos> Oh, no, you're not wearing that to school.
If that's how it works,<eos> I'm gonna do and say whatever I want.<eos> Oh, no, you're not wearing that to school.<eos> My Cupid Day outfit.<eos> Yeah, well, you don't want to give people the wrong idea.
No, this is not happening.<eos> Go back up and change, please.<eos> This is my life.<eos> I'll do whatever the hell I want with it.<eos> Dan, can you just jump in here, please?
Maybe I was dead and in hell.<eos> Maybe I was alive and in hell.<eos> But it didn't matter.<eos> Nothing mattered anymore.<eos> What are you wearing?
What happened to Sam?<eos> Uh, someone forgot to take her happy pills this morning.<eos> I took mine.<eos> Well, I know something that'll cheer you right up.<eos> I swear to God, Elody, if you hand me a condom right now...
I swear to God, Elody, if you hand me a condom right now...<eos> But it's your present.<eos> For your special night.<eos> Take it.<eos> Unless you want to be a walking STD farm.
But it's your present.<eos> For your special night.<eos> Take it.<eos> Unless you want to be a walking STD farm.<eos> You would know.
Unless you want to be a walking STD farm.<eos> You would know.<eos> At least I'm not still a virgin.<eos> What the hell is wrong with you?<eos> What did you just say to me?
You would know.<eos> At least I'm not still a virgin.<eos> What the hell is wrong with you?<eos> What did you just say to me?<eos> Do you feel like you need to prove to us that you don't give a shit?
Do you feel like you need to prove to us that you don't give a shit?<eos> Is that what it is?<eos> 'Cause guess what?<eos> You don't need to prove anything.<eos> We all know that you don't give a damn about anybody but yourself.
We're all pretty fucking clear on that!<eos> What the hell is your problem today, Sam?<eos> You guys, don't fight.<eos> Just drop it.<eos> What, you don't agree?
Stop it, Sam.<eos> Out.<eos> Get out!<eos> Now!<eos> I'd love to hear what you say about me behind my back.
Sisyphus.<eos> Sam!<eos> What?<eos> You can take 'em.<eos> Oh, Sam, you're breaking hearts left and right.
Get this bitch out of here!<eos> Psycho!<eos> What the hell?<eos> Shit.<eos> What are you doing in here?
Aw, you need a pair of these.<eos> Comfiest shoes I ever owned. Really?<eos> All right, your loss.<eos> Whatever.<eos> You wanna trade?
I'm not gonna remember any of you.<eos> I win.<eos> Do you ever feel like you're living the same day over and over again with only, like, a few things being different?<eos> Oh, shit, Samantha.<eos> You just described my whole life!
You just described my whole life!<eos> Hey, what's up?<eos> Hey, Sam.<eos> Did you have to ask permission to talk to me?<eos> Lindsay's just really upset about what you said.
Hey, what's up?<eos> Hey, Sam.<eos> Did you have to ask permission to talk to me?<eos> Lindsay's just really upset about what you said.<eos> You should apologize.
Well, everything that I said was true, so...<eos> It doesn't matter if it's true.<eos> She's Lindsay.<eos> She's ours.<eos> We're each other's, you know?
She's Lindsay.<eos> She's ours.<eos> We're each other's, you know?<eos> Just apologize.<eos> You're not listening to me.
You're the one always criticizing people and hurting people.<eos> You're the one who lied about being friends with her and then tortured her for all these years.<eos> I just followed along and yet...<eos> I'm the one paying for it.<eos> Sam, what are you talking about?
Sam, I haven't seen you in, like, forever.<eos> Where have you...<eos> Get this bitch on a leash!<eos> I love you.<eos> Is that what you wanted to hear?
Is that what you wanted to hear?<eos> Go back to the ward, you psycho bitch!<eos> Sam?<eos> Hey, are you okay?<eos> Obviously, you're crying.
Don't worry about it.<eos> The sign's just really for other people, so they don't get in my stuff.<eos> It's the first big party I've ever had, so...<eos> Why'd you have one now?<eos> I figured if I had a party, you'd come.
Is that the one we used to sit in?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, we did.<eos> Do you remember climbing up it?<eos> And then you jumped down and sprained your ankle?
Hey, hey, hey. Hey.<eos> Just stay for a second. Okay?<eos> I can drive you home or...<eos> I don't want to go home.<eos> Okay, well, you can, uh...
Just stay for a second. Okay?<eos> I can drive you home or...<eos> I don't want to go home.<eos> Okay, well, you can, uh...<eos> You could crash here if you want.
It's always like that.<eos> I wish we could be here forever.<eos> Okay, let's try again.<eos> We're taking a day off.<eos> I think you're just gonna drool around.
Okay, let's try again.<eos> We're taking a day off.<eos> I think you're just gonna drool around.<eos> What is it?<eos> And then you're just gonna go through there and then like that.
I wanted it to be a worthy day.<eos> But not just for me.<eos> Do the kids at school ever make fun of you for the way that you talk?<eos> Sometimes.<eos> You can do something about that.
But not just for me.<eos> Do the kids at school ever make fun of you for the way that you talk?<eos> Sometimes.<eos> You can do something about that.<eos> You know, you can learn to talk differently.
Who did that?<eos> Lindsay.<eos> How come you're so mean to Mom?<eos> I'm not mean to Mom.<eos> You drew a line on the floor with nail polish and said she couldn't cross it.
Oh, my gosh. Look at you guys.<eos> - Can you send those to me?<eos> So cute!<eos> Those are beautiful.<eos> Remember when you used to come here all the time?
It was really sweet what you did today.<eos> Do you think I'm a good person?<eos> Of course I think you're a good person.<eos> But it doesn't really matter what I think.<eos> I mean, what's important is what you think.
But it doesn't really matter what I think.<eos> I mean, what's important is what you think.<eos> No, I'm serious.<eos> I want to know...<eos> Why do you think that I'm a good person?
No, I'm serious.<eos> I want to know...<eos> Why do you think that I'm a good person?<eos> Do you remember when you were a little girl?<eos> You used to take turns riding all of the horses in the stable so that none of them would feel left out?
I want to know...<eos> Why do you think that I'm a good person?<eos> Do you remember when you were a little girl?<eos> You used to take turns riding all of the horses in the stable so that none of them would feel left out?<eos> Do you remember that?
Do you remember that?<eos> I do. Mmm-hmm.<eos> But I was a little girl.<eos> It's different.<eos> But you have a big heart, Sam.
You just focus on that one good thing, and you see where it leads you.<eos> How is it possible to change so much and not be able to change anything at all?<eos> I knew I had to do something.<eos> Something good.<eos> You made it.
No.<eos> Forget the sign.<eos> It's no big deal.<eos> That's really just there for other people, so they don't mess with my stuff.<eos> I'm glad you came. Yeah.
It's no big deal.<eos> That's really just there for other people, so they don't mess with my stuff.<eos> I'm glad you came. Yeah.<eos> I had to.<eos> I like what you've done with the place.
Yeah, not so good in the morning, though.<eos> It's like waking up in...<eos> In the middle of the sun.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I hope you don't think that it's weird that I'm here with you right now.
I once wore Crocs for 365 days straight, so I don't think anything's weird.<eos> I forgot about your Crocs phase.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why are you always so nice to me?<eos> Well, do you remember in third grade right after my dad died?
Well, do you remember in third grade right after my dad died?<eos> We were in the cafeteria and I was crying, and Phil Howe came up to me, called me a baby, and then smacked my tray right out of my hand, and food went flying everywhere.<eos> I remember what we were eating, too.<eos> It was, um, mashed potatoes and turkey burgers.<eos> And you came over, you scooped up the mashed potatoes right off the ground and you went up to Phil and you smashed the mashed potatoes right in his face.

I mean, I didn't laugh more that day than...<eos> I mean...<eos> It was the first time I laughed since my dad died and I...<eos> Do you remember what I said to you?<eos> "You're my hero."
Juliet!<eos> Juliet!<eos> Juliet!<eos> Juliet!<eos> What are you doing?
Juliet!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I know what happened back there.<eos> Get away from me.<eos> And I feel really bad about it, and I know this may sound crazy, but I have a feeling I may be able to understand you better than you think that I could.
What are you doing?<eos> I know what happened back there.<eos> Get away from me.<eos> And I feel really bad about it, and I know this may sound crazy, but I have a feeling I may be able to understand you better than you think that I could.<eos> You hate me.
I used to sleep over at her house.<eos> Her parents would be fighting so bad.<eos> She was so upset.<eos> She was so upset, she started wetting the bed.<eos> You remember the name you all gave me in fifth grade?
You remember the name you all gave me in fifth grade?<eos> The name Lindsay gave me?<eos> "Mellow Yellow."<eos> Remember that?<eos> You remember the camping trip when I supposedly peed in my sleeping bag?
Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Sammy, you forgot your gloves!<eos> What would I do without you?<eos> You are perfect the way that you are, Fizzy.
Always remember that.<eos> I can't breathe!<eos> It's cold!<eos> Yeah.<eos> What are you doing?
Yeah, baby!<eos> Nice tits!<eos> Get in!<eos> Yes.<eos> You know how I like it.
Yes.<eos> You know how I like it.<eos> Hey, Elody.<eos> What, do I have white stuff on my face?<eos> You know why I love you?
You know how I like it.<eos> Hey, Elody.<eos> What, do I have white stuff on my face?<eos> You know why I love you?<eos> I love you because you're down for anything.
What, do I have white stuff on my face?<eos> You know why I love you?<eos> I love you because you're down for anything.<eos> Always.<eos> You know I'm a down-ass bitch.
Hey, I'm down, too.<eos> Ooh.<eos> Okay.<eos> No, I love you, Ally, because you're curious about the world.<eos> And you're passionate, and you are driven.
No, I love you, Ally, because you're curious about the world.<eos> And you're passionate, and you are driven.<eos> Did someone swallow Oprah this morning?<eos> I love you, Linds.<eos> I love you because you're the kind of friend that toilet-papers Jason Foster's house for a week straight all by herself just because he said that I was a bad kisser.
Be careful.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> Sam. Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> Um... "You're my hero."
Um... "You're my hero."<eos> You got a secret admirer?<eos> Secret?<eos> That's not so secret.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.
That's not so secret.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Well, um...<eos> Well, hey, listen, I'm having a party tonight. Mmm-hmm.<eos> And I was wondering if you maybe wanted to come, maybe?
A secret.<eos> Later?<eos> Okay.<eos> Yes. Okay.<eos> Wait, the "you're my hero" thing, how did you...
Yes. Okay.<eos> Wait, the "you're my hero" thing, how did you...<eos> Thank you for my beautiful rose.<eos> I love it.<eos> What'd you say to me?
Thank you for my beautiful rose.<eos> I love it.<eos> What'd you say to me?<eos> This is not working out.<eos> Okay, Sam, you can't break up with me.
Hey, Linds.<eos> All right, well, let's do this!<eos> Linds.<eos> What?<eos> How come you never told me about your parents' divorce?
Are you serious?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why would I talk about something that happened a thousand years ago?<eos> Because it happened to you.<eos> And you matter to me.
Yeah.<eos> Why would I talk about something that happened a thousand years ago?<eos> Because it happened to you.<eos> And you matter to me.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.
I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Come here. Okay?<eos> Let's go inside.<eos> Come here.<eos> You know you don't have to act so tough all the time.
Come with me.<eos> What?<eos> Okay.<eos> What?<eos> I believe you owe me a secret, right?
Just for a second.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Please?<eos> Actually, I kind of have somewhere I have to be.<eos> I know what you have planned for tonight and I want you to know that you don't have to do this. Okay?
It's okay.<eos> Please?<eos> Actually, I kind of have somewhere I have to be.<eos> I know what you have planned for tonight and I want you to know that you don't have to do this. Okay?<eos> You don't know anything.
Please?<eos> Actually, I kind of have somewhere I have to be.<eos> I know what you have planned for tonight and I want you to know that you don't have to do this. Okay?<eos> You don't know anything.<eos> I know that you have something to tell me.
I have to go.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> I'm trying to tell you how sorry...<eos> I am sorry.<eos> You said that.
Leave me alone!<eos> I can't.<eos> Sam!<eos> Sam!<eos> Why did you run away from me?
Sam!<eos> Sam!<eos> Why did you run away from me?<eos> I can't talk to you right now.<eos> You've been ignoring me for years, and then you...
Sam!<eos> Why did you run away from me?<eos> I can't talk to you right now.<eos> You've been ignoring me for years, and then you...<eos> You kiss me and then go back to acting like I'm invisible?
You've been ignoring me for years, and then you...<eos> You kiss me and then go back to acting like I'm invisible?<eos> I meant everything that happened back there.<eos> That's all I can say, that I meant it, and I wish it hadn't taken me so long.<eos> Sam, are you in trouble?
You kiss me and then go back to acting like I'm invisible?<eos> I meant everything that happened back there.<eos> That's all I can say, that I meant it, and I wish it hadn't taken me so long.<eos> Sam, are you in trouble?<eos> You can trust me.
I meant everything that happened back there.<eos> That's all I can say, that I meant it, and I wish it hadn't taken me so long.<eos> Sam, are you in trouble?<eos> You can trust me.<eos> You can trust me back.
Wait!<eos> Wait!<eos> Why?<eos> What's going on?<eos> Why are you following me?
Why?<eos> What's going on?<eos> Why are you following me?<eos> Why can't you leave me alone?<eos> You don't want to die.
What's going on?<eos> Why are you following me?<eos> Why can't you leave me alone?<eos> You don't want to die.<eos> You want the pain to stop.
You don't want to die.<eos> You want the pain to stop.<eos> Stop.<eos> You stop.<eos> You don't know me.
You want the pain to stop.<eos> Stop.<eos> You stop.<eos> You don't know me.<eos> You could never understand.
Stop.<eos> You stop.<eos> You don't know me.<eos> You could never understand.<eos> You have a choice, Juliet.
Not everybody gets that.<eos> Sam!<eos> Please let me help you.<eos> Don't you get it?<eos> You can't help me.
There is nothing wrong with you.<eos> Don't let anyone tell you that there is.<eos> This is just a blip.<eos> Your life will change, Juliet.<eos> If you just hold on for one more minute.
Even after they're over, they still go on.<eos> They are the meaning.<eos> Sam?<eos> Sam?<eos> You saved me.
Okay.<eos> Stand back.<eos> You poor thing.<eos> You poor, poor thing.<eos> How are you, boy?
Well, who's gonna feed him?<eos> I will.<eos> Who's gonna clean him?<eos> I'll do everything, Dad.<eos> You think you're ready to do it?
Please!<eos> He's a retriever, Dad.<eos> He'll fetch your slippers.<eos> And the paper when it rains.<eos> Name something you want fetched. He can do it.
And the paper when it rains.<eos> Name something you want fetched. He can do it.<eos> Look.<eos> Just come here.<eos> What are you doing?
Oh, come on.<eos> He's gonna be bored with it.<eos> Oh, come on, Jim.<eos> No!<eos> You know how he is.
You know how he is.<eos> If he says no, we can run off and go find another family.<eos> Ethan.<eos> Yeah?<eos> You have a dog.
- Bailey, get in the car.<eos> - Come on, boy!<eos> Come on.<eos> I wanna know<eos> If you'll be my girl
Oh, it stinks!<eos> Oh, boy, look who's here.<eos> Guess what we got!<eos> What have you got?<eos> What'd you get?
Yeah.<eos> Enjoying a meal.<eos> I liked the old humans.<eos> They got me.<eos> Would you please stop feeding the dog?
They got me.<eos> Would you please stop feeding the dog?<eos> We're trying to train him.<eos> I told you.<eos> You caught me.
Oh, yeah.<eos> Keep rubbing.<eos> And might there be more bacon?<eos> Oh, look at his plate.<eos> You know, the way you eat, you're gonna grow up to be bigger than all of us put together.
If there's a world to grow up in.<eos> These Russians are putting missiles in Cuba.<eos> Do we have to talk about that now?<eos> No.<eos> So, Jim, I hear you're up for a new office job.
These Russians are putting missiles in Cuba.<eos> Do we have to talk about that now?<eos> No.<eos> So, Jim, I hear you're up for a new office job.<eos> Why don't you tell us about that?
Well, they want him in the field.<eos> He's one of the top sellers every year.<eos> I got the job nobody wants.<eos> Jim.<eos> Do you have to?
Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> Sniff me.<eos> Sniff me!<eos> You don't know anything!
Come on.<eos> Sniff me.<eos> Sniff me!<eos> You don't know anything!<eos> Wow, you clear your throat a lot.
Come on!<eos> Ethan, my boss is coming over tonight.<eos> And he cannot see my office like this.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> You have got to start telling this dog who's boss.
Just take him. And you say, "I am the boss!"<eos> You gotta show him who's boss.<eos> All right, everything goes back where it belongs.<eos> I want this place spick and span, do you understand?<eos> Well, do you understand?
Yes, sir.<eos> Thank you.<eos> "I want everything just the way I like it.<eos> "Spick and span.<eos> "Why? Because I'm the boss, that's why." I'm the boss man and you're the boss dog.
No!<eos> Ethan was good to me.<eos> He always shared his food.<eos> Do you have it in your mouth?<eos> Did you swallow it?
Whoa, get that dog!<eos> Get the dog! Get the dog!<eos> I don't see anything.<eos> Right there.<eos> Maybe you saw Smokey.
Maybe you saw Smokey.<eos> - Definitely not Smokey.<eos> - It wasn't Smokey.<eos> I really don't like rats.<eos> It's more scared of you than you are of him.
What was that?<eos> - Herman!<eos> - Bailey, come here!<eos> Come here!<eos> You got him, Jim?
- Herman!<eos> - Bailey, come here!<eos> Come here!<eos> You got him, Jim?<eos> You got him?
Hey, boy!<eos> It's cold out there, isn't it?<eos> I knew he needed me.<eos> And I needed him, too.<eos> You're a good boy.
Nice throw.<eos> Nice play!<eos> Great pass, Ethan.<eos> You just get it to him every time.<eos> Yeah, exactly. 'Cause every time you run that play...
You just get it to him every time.<eos> Yeah, exactly. 'Cause every time you run that play...<eos> Everybody wanted to walk next to the alpha male.<eos> Almost everybody.<eos> Ethan, why do you always have this dog with you?
When Lou dropped that pass at the start?<eos> I thought we were done, man. Here.<eos> Bailey, come here!<eos> Hey, Dad.<eos> - You hungry?
Africa is home to hundreds of thousands of animals.<eos> Some look comical, some forbidding, and some so entrancing, that we'd like to reach out...<eos> So, uh, Coach made me starting quarterback today.<eos> That's great, kid.<eos> You gotta come to my next game, Dad.
That was the dog.<eos> That wasn't me.<eos> I wouldn't do that.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, maybe you should teach your dog some manners.
Well, maybe you should teach your dog some manners.<eos> I've been trying.<eos> He's not too smart.<eos> Really?<eos> Did you hear what he said about you?
I've been trying.<eos> He's not too smart.<eos> Really?<eos> Did you hear what he said about you?<eos> You look pretty smart to me.
Nice!<eos> Yeah. Oh!<eos> Keep that away from him.<eos> Okay, okay, okay.<eos> You're really good at that.
If we never speak again, I just wanna take back what I said before about my dog not being smart.<eos> He's actually really smart.<eos> Definitely smarter than me.<eos> Now they both had a sweaty smell.<eos> You wanna get a hot dog or something?
It was fun.<eos> It was.<eos> Except for having to pay for 28 hot dogs.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Yeah, you better go.
- No, it's not okay.<eos> - No.<eos> Besides, I'm going.<eos> Fine.<eos> You don't listen to me.
Every time I ask you where something comes from...<eos> You tell me!<eos> You tell me where it's going!<eos> 'Cause I earn it! I earn it!<eos> You wanna go to town instead?
I don't wanna go back to school.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> I do?<eos> Yes!<eos> You are going to get a big football scholarship at a good school.
Yes!<eos> You are going to get a big football scholarship at a good school.<eos> And then I'm gonna apply to that school and get an academic scholarship.<eos> And then we'll both be at college, and we'll never be apart.<eos> Wow, you've got it all planned out, huh?
Yes, indeed.<eos> That's a good plan.<eos> Right, Bailey?<eos> What?<eos> What did you say?
Good boy.<eos> I gotta go.<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> - I'm getting some beer.<eos> All I asked was for you to lower your voice.
- I'm getting some beer.<eos> All I asked was for you to lower your voice.<eos> Stop!<eos> Stop! Stop!<eos> Will you please just keep it down?
Stop! Stop!<eos> Will you please just keep it down?<eos> My parents are upstairs, Jim.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You're right.
Stop it, Elizabeth!<eos> Shut up!<eos> Shut up!<eos> I'm trying to help you, Jim.<eos> You're trying to help me? You wanna help me?
Shut up!<eos> Shut up!<eos> I'm trying to help you, Jim.<eos> You're trying to help me? You wanna help me?<eos> You're my wife, Elizabeth.
Shut up!<eos> I'm trying to help you, Jim.<eos> You're trying to help me? You wanna help me?<eos> You're my wife, Elizabeth.<eos> You should support me.
You're trying to help me? You wanna help me?<eos> You're my wife, Elizabeth.<eos> You should support me.<eos> I do support you.<eos> Will you just come back inside?
I do support you.<eos> Will you just come back inside?<eos> Hey. Hey, pal.<eos> Hey.<eos> You spying on me?
Hey. Hey, pal.<eos> Hey.<eos> You spying on me?<eos> What?<eos> You spying on me?
What?<eos> You spying on me?<eos> Leave him alone, Jim.<eos> Come here.<eos> Oh, you got something to say?
Look at how he looks at me.<eos> I am so sick of the way you look at me.<eos> Relax.<eos> Look at how you look at me.<eos> What are you doing?
Look at how you look at me.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> This has nothing to do with him!<eos> - Stay out of it!<eos> - What are you doing?
- What are you doing?<eos> Easy. Take it easy.<eos> Take it easy.<eos> God!<eos> You're right.
God!<eos> You're right.<eos> I'm gonna...<eos> Don't you ever touch her again!<eos> You hear me?
You're right.<eos> I'm gonna...<eos> Don't you ever touch her again!<eos> You hear me?<eos> You gotta go.
Mom, he's gotta go.<eos> He can't stay here.<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You sure you've got everything?
- Come on.<eos> - Got his brains from his mom, huh?<eos> Hey, Dad.<eos> Hey, pal.<eos> What are you doing here?
Hey, pal.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I saw ya.<eos> I saw ya tonight...<eos> And you did good.
What are you doing here?<eos> I saw ya.<eos> I saw ya tonight...<eos> And you did good.<eos> You were at the game?
I saw ya tonight...<eos> And you did good.<eos> You were at the game?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You got a good arm.
For Bailey?<eos> Hey, boss dog.<eos> Good boy.<eos> So, it's not all perfect in Ethan Land, huh.<eos> Now I know why you're going to Michigan, man.
Good boy.<eos> So, it's not all perfect in Ethan Land, huh.<eos> Now I know why you're going to Michigan, man.<eos> Get away from that alchy father of yours.<eos> You should shut up, Todd.
Now I know why you're going to Michigan, man.<eos> Get away from that alchy father of yours.<eos> You should shut up, Todd.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> You don't want everyone here knowing that your father's a drunk?
The window.<eos> Come here.<eos> Fire!<eos> Fire!<eos> You've gotta jump.
No!<eos> Is there anything I can do?<eos> We gotta help him down.<eos> Come on, Ethan.<eos> - You need to jump, son!
Hi!<eos> I missed you, too.<eos> Good boy!<eos> Good boy!<eos> You're such a good boy. Come on!
You're such a good boy. Come on!<eos> Come on!<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> Do you, um, do you wanna go to the pond?
Hey.<eos> Do you, um, do you wanna go to the pond?<eos> I made some sandwiches.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, if you want.
Yeah, if you want.<eos> I just thought it'd be nice if we could get out of the house.<eos> Get you out.<eos> What?<eos> Look, Hannah, it's nice for you to try, but you don't have to...
I just thought it'd be nice if we could get out of the house.<eos> Get you out.<eos> What?<eos> Look, Hannah, it's nice for you to try, but you don't have to...<eos> You don't have to do this. You don't have to help me.
Look, Hannah, it's nice for you to try, but you don't have to...<eos> You don't have to do this. You don't have to help me.<eos> I'm not doing it for you.<eos> I'm doing it for us.<eos> No, you're doing this for me.
You don't have to do this. You don't have to help me.<eos> I'm not doing it for you.<eos> I'm doing it for us.<eos> No, you're doing this for me.<eos> You leave for college in three weeks.
You leave for college in three weeks.<eos> But I'll be back all the time. Uh-huh.<eos> And I'll be here.<eos> With that.<eos> You have to stop feeling sorry for yourself.
But I'll be back all the time. Uh-huh.<eos> And I'll be here.<eos> With that.<eos> You have to stop feeling sorry for yourself.<eos> You can't do this for me, Hannah.
I don't think we should be with each other anymore, Hannah.<eos> We shouldn't be with each other anymore.<eos> It's not gonna work.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Why are you doing this?
I'm sorry.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> Bailey.<eos> Good boy.<eos> You want your ball?
Bailey!<eos> It's been so long since we've played.<eos> Bailey?<eos> I like this new version of fetch.<eos> You're crazy.
It's been so long since we've played.<eos> Bailey?<eos> I like this new version of fetch.<eos> You're crazy.<eos> You know that, boss dog?
It's Grandpa.<eos> Ethan?<eos> Are you here?<eos> I can't smell you.<eos> Where are you?
Find Wally.<eos> Search!<eos> Go!<eos> Wally was a disaster, always losing pieces of clothing.<eos> You found him.
This was definitely the worst shot I ever got.<eos> Ellie.<eos> You're gonna be okay.<eos> You're gonna be okay.<eos> You're a good dog.
You're gonna be okay.<eos> You're gonna be okay.<eos> You're a good dog.<eos> I could tell from Carlos' voice I'd done a good job.<eos> You're a good dog.
But I did good work.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Now I'm tiny, and all ears!<eos> Hi, you.<eos> Are you the cutest little puppy in the world?
Are you the cutest little puppy in the world?<eos> She smelled good.<eos> Like sunshine and pretzels.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> You wanna come home with me, huh?
She smelled good.<eos> Like sunshine and pretzels.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> You wanna come home with me, huh?<eos> Okay, you gotta come home with me.
Like sunshine and pretzels.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> You wanna come home with me, huh?<eos> Okay, you gotta come home with me.<eos> You gotta come home with me, huh?
Oh, yeah.<eos> You wanna come home with me, huh?<eos> Okay, you gotta come home with me.<eos> You gotta come home with me, huh?<eos> You gonna help me with this?
Okay, you gotta come home with me.<eos> You gotta come home with me, huh?<eos> You gonna help me with this?<eos> What's happening?<eos> Where are you going?
Come here.<eos> What's going on? What's going on, huh?<eos> I could tell she was sad.<eos> I needed to cheer her up.<eos> What are you doing?
Cute dog.<eos> Uh-huh. Thanks.<eos> Listen, a few of us are putting together a study group.<eos> We're meeting at the Woodford common room.<eos> We'd love for you to join us.
There was no one else in our pack.<eos> Just Maya and me.<eos> But I'm starting to get her.<eos> Actually, I can read her mind.<eos> You know what I'm thinking?
Actually, I can read her mind.<eos> You know what I'm thinking?<eos> Chips.<eos> Chips.<eos> You know what I'm thinking?
Pizza.<eos> Hey, Chris.<eos> Hi.<eos> Bye.<eos> You ready?
Hi.<eos> Bye.<eos> You ready?<eos> I am ready.<eos> You know what I'm thinking?
You ready?<eos> I am ready.<eos> You know what I'm thinking?<eos> Ice cream!<eos> It's ridiculous, but sometimes I actually think you know what I'm thinking.
Ice cream!<eos> It's ridiculous, but sometimes I actually think you know what I'm thinking.<eos> Ice cream, ice cream, ice cream.<eos> Ugh! Tino, I'm spending way too much time alone.<eos> You wanna go get some ice cream?
It's ridiculous, but sometimes I actually think you know what I'm thinking.<eos> Ice cream, ice cream, ice cream.<eos> Ugh! Tino, I'm spending way too much time alone.<eos> You wanna go get some ice cream?<eos> You've read my mind.
I think this is it, Tino.<eos> I think it's just gonna be you and me.<eos> I don't know. That's fine, right?<eos> Because<eos> I love you, and you love me and love is all that matters.
I love you, and you love me and love is all that matters.<eos> It's not like it matters where you get your love.<eos> As long as something loves you, right?<eos> Can I have some more?<eos> Oh, you're so sweet.

Oh, you're so sweet.<eos> You're so cute.<eos> Hi!<eos> I love you.<eos> Why can't you be my boyfriend, huh?
You're so cute.<eos> Hi!<eos> I love you.<eos> Why can't you be my boyfriend, huh?<eos> Why can't you give me more ice cream?
Get the ball.<eos> Come on!<eos> Why was I being punished like this?<eos> Tino, come on.<eos> You're a dog.
My heart was aflutter.<eos> What a catch!<eos> Tino!<eos> Bring it back to me.<eos> Are you feeling what I'm feeling?
Bring it back to me.<eos> Are you feeling what I'm feeling?<eos> Hey, I'm sorry.<eos> My dog's acting so weird today. No, it's okay.<eos> Come on, are you gonna chase this?
Maya?<eos> There's been something on my mind that I've been wanting to talk to you about.<eos> Oh, I recognize that sweaty smell.<eos> We been together for a while now, and, um...<eos> Maya, I want you to be my wife.
Come here.<eos> Okay, I think we ready.<eos> Okay, perfect.<eos> Okay. Ready.<eos> You're jealous because Fallon's had her baby and that's made you even more paranoid.
Oh! What?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> It was a baby.<eos> Is she breathing?<eos> You've gotta relax, honey.
But as the years went by, I missed Roxy.<eos> It just wasn't the same without her.<eos> Hey, Tino.<eos> Tino.<eos> You know what I'm thinking?
No pizza?<eos> I'm not hungry.<eos> Okay.<eos> Tino.<eos> What are you thinking?
I'm not hungry.<eos> Okay.<eos> Tino.<eos> What are you thinking?<eos> What are you thinking?
Okay.<eos> Tino.<eos> What are you thinking?<eos> What are you thinking?<eos> Tino, what are you thinking?
Come on.<eos> I named him Waffles.<eos> Not inside.<eos> Come on.<eos> I kept telling her you were going to get bigger.
We're getting rid of him.<eos> We are not.<eos> - That's enough!<eos> - That dog! I took him in here.<eos> You'll make sure he finds a nice home, right?
That looks like fun.<eos> Go get 'em.<eos> There he is.<eos> It's been so long since I've had fun.<eos> Do you wanna bring your dog?
That would be great.<eos> Do I know you?<eos> There's something about you.<eos> It's your smell.<eos> Aw, you're a scruffy one.
There's something about you.<eos> It's your smell.<eos> Aw, you're a scruffy one.<eos> Are you lost?<eos> Where are you from?
It's your smell.<eos> Aw, you're a scruffy one.<eos> Are you lost?<eos> Where are you from?<eos> You got a collar?
It's me!<eos> Boss dog!<eos> Bailey, Bailey, Bailey.<eos> Doodle dog!<eos> Where'd you come from?
Doodle dog!<eos> Where'd you come from?<eos> After all these lives, I'd actually found him!<eos> I found Ethan!<eos> I'm gonna make a bet you're hungry.
I'm gonna make a bet you're hungry.<eos> Here ya go.<eos> Wow, you must be.<eos> Don't look at me like that.<eos> You can't stay here.
Wow, you must be.<eos> Don't look at me like that.<eos> You can't stay here.<eos> You gotta go home.<eos> You belong to somebody.
Yes!<eos> Yes, I'm home!<eos> Go home, dog.<eos> Go home.<eos> You're a stubborn one, aren't ya?
No, don't leave me here.<eos> This is a white-coat place.<eos> I belong with you.<eos> So long, dog.<eos> You wanna get outta here?
This is a white-coat place.<eos> I belong with you.<eos> So long, dog.<eos> You wanna get outta here?<eos> Do you wanna go?
Okay, buddy.<eos> Guess it's gonna be you and me.<eos> And the donkey.<eos> What's a donkey?<eos> Now, when was the last time you got a bath?
There you go.<eos> All right.<eos> Just step out.<eos> Out. Let's go.<eos> You're getting a new collar.
This is a surprise.<eos> It's stronger now.<eos> I got you some groceries.<eos> It's Hannah!<eos> You're still here?
It's stronger now.<eos> I got you some groceries.<eos> It's Hannah!<eos> You're still here?<eos> Oh, you look different.
I got you some groceries.<eos> It's Hannah!<eos> You're still here?<eos> Oh, you look different.<eos> But you still smell like biscuits.
Must have been tough on you, losing your husband after all those years.<eos> Yeah, it made me miss my daughter a lot.<eos> And then with the new baby coming, I thought Rachel and Miguel could really use the help.<eos> Yeah.<eos> How long you get to stay for?
Well, this place is still the same.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Oh, come on!<eos> So, what about you?<eos> You never met anyone? Or...
You never met anyone? Or...<eos> Never found the right fit.<eos> I'm really stubborn.<eos> I know that.<eos> When you put your mind to something, that was that.
Well, don't worry.<eos> It was a long, long time ago.<eos> No, I pushed you away.<eos> And I was really mad at the world.<eos> And I just want you to know that not a day goes by that
And I was really mad at the world.<eos> And I just want you to know that not a day goes by that<eos> I don't kick myself for doing that.<eos> There's that sweaty smell.<eos> You think, um, it'd be crazy if
Enough talking.<eos> Use your nose!<eos> Then don't.<eos> Okay.<eos> Now you're getting it.
Get out of here.<eos> Give 'em some space.<eos> Hi, you little cutie pie.<eos> My water has mint in it.<eos> You have a good time?
That's familiar.<eos> I smelled...<eos> Me.<eos> What do you got there?<eos> Where did you find that?
Me.<eos> What do you got there?<eos> Where did you find that?<eos> Hey.<eos> You wanna play?
Where did you find that?<eos> Hey.<eos> You wanna play?<eos> Get ready.<eos> You have to really go after this one.
All right.<eos> You go play, all right?<eos> Gotta get back.<eos> What?<eos> What do you want?
What do you want?<eos> This is nuts.<eos> All right, Buddy.<eos> You wanna go for the showstopper?<eos> You wanna try it?
This is nuts.<eos> All right, Buddy.<eos> You wanna go for the showstopper?<eos> You wanna try it?<eos> You wanna get it?
Ready?<eos> I am ready.<eos> Okay.<eos> Go!<eos> Where did you learn how to do that, Buddy?
I am ready.<eos> Okay.<eos> Go!<eos> Where did you learn how to do that, Buddy?<eos> You are really starting to freak me out, boss dog.
A sad, pointless charade built on lies.<eos> You have to have the courage to go your own way.<eos> Happiness is hard to come by.<eos> Sure as hell aren't gonna find it in some stupid gadget.<eos> There you are, tapping on some little box... while the real shit is happening all around you, dumbass.
Jesus Christ.<eos> St. Louis?<eos> It's actually a pretty interesting town.<eos> Oh, okay, that flies in the face of everything I've ever heard... about St. Louis in particular and Missouri at large!<eos> What the hell do you know about it?
Holy shit.<eos> This has nothing to do with you, Wilson.<eos> Oh, that's nice!<eos> Thanks for thinking of me!<eos> I always knew that she hated me... but I always thought that you were my best friend!
That's not so bad, I guess.<eos> Of all the times to call!<eos> Hello?<eos> He what?<eos> Honey, you're so beautiful!
Diego lives here with me.<eos> He helps out a ton with the animals.<eos> Okay, yeah.<eos> That's just...<eos> How do you know he's not some crazy dog fucker?
No, I'm not.<eos> Where you headed, bro?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> What?<eos> Where you going?
Took a bad turn last night.<eos> Fell in the shower.<eos> Sorry, to hear that.<eos> So...<eos> What do you do?
I mean I want to know... what are the actual activities of your day?<eos> You know, different things.<eos> Meetings, phone calls, reports.<eos> But, you know, I mostly... primarily focus on manage...<eos> Listen, brother, forty years from now you're gonna be on your deathbed saying:
"Some shitwork for the oligarchs?"<eos> I actually enjoy what I do, and I've worked my ass off to get there.<eos> How did we end up like this?<eos> Okay, so... this is it, I guess.<eos> When Mom died it just happened, you know, but... you have the chance to leave me with something.

When Mom died it just happened, you know, but... you have the chance to leave me with something.<eos> Couldn't you... see that I needed you to tell me just one time... that you loved me?<eos> Or that you hated me, or... something.<eos> Something besides the problems with your goddamn garden.<eos> If you can hear me, just squeeze my hand.
If it wasn't for him, I'd throw like a damn pussy.<eos> He was a good... man, in general, you know?<eos> Who's that?<eos> It's me, Wilson.<eos> I wanted to see if you still lived here.
Who's that?<eos> It's me, Wilson.<eos> I wanted to see if you still lived here.<eos> Can I come in?<eos> You want some beet juice?
I wanted to see if you still lived here.<eos> Can I come in?<eos> You want some beet juice?<eos> Fuck, no!<eos> You seen Meyers lately?
I don't have any family left.<eos> And I've known you... since we were, what, nine years old?<eos> I don't have a single person who shares my same memories, you know?<eos> Lucky you.<eos> You know... people always said that you were kind of "difficult," but I don't know, I guess that...
Empty fucking bank account?<eos> Getting bitched at all the time?<eos> It's a fucking fool's errand!<eos> You know, Olsen, I was thinking that maybe we could be friends again.<eos> But I guess... I sort of forgot... what a toxic soul-draining vampire you really are.
That's good.<eos> Wow, this place has got 1,748 reviews on Yelp.<eos> And what the hell does that even mean?<eos> Yelp.<eos> Aren't you a little old to be doing all that computer stuff?
You know, it just feels so undignified to me.<eos> I mean, in the end you're just sitting all alone staring at a screen.<eos> It's just so sad.<eos> I would be a lot lonelier without it, that's for sure.<eos> Have you ever been married?
"I'm into dudes," you know?<eos> I'm done with her.<eos> I just need to move on, find somebody new.<eos> Not you necessarily, but...<eos> Did you ever do a PeopleFinder search, or even just Google?
My ex?<eos> Pippi.<eos> Pippi what?<eos> Pippi Carmichael.<eos> But like I said, you won't find a...
Yeah, that's her.<eos> Yeah, she's right over there in Silverdale.<eos> So... after six years, this guy's all, "I love you, "but I just don't see a future for us."<eos> And I'm like, "I get it, dude.<eos> You're into penis.
Oh, good.<eos> Can I ask you something?<eos> Sure. What's going on?<eos> Okay.<eos> Have you ever seen this woman?
Have you ever seen this woman?<eos> Now, this is an old picture, so she... probably looks much, much worse now.<eos> Bruises from the drug use and beatings.<eos> Frizzy coke hair.<eos> Waxy skin. You, of all people, know the drill.
I'm sorry, I don't know her.<eos> Well, in that case, I guess I'll... take a blowjob then.<eos> All right.<eos> I should've brought my wallet.<eos> Belinda, do you know where Pippi is?
I blame her father.<eos> Rich Republican prick.<eos> But that's a pretty good way to get back at him, I suppose.<eos> "Hey, I'm blowing strangers for drug money, Daddy.<eos> "What do you think of me now?"
Jesus Christ, man!<eos> I'm just trying to get my life together and make a clean start.<eos> Why would you show up and say that shit?<eos> I can't get over how amazing you look.<eos> I thought you'd be some... nasty, skanky, rat-haired, snaggle-toothed... sore-infested ho.

Wilson, you showed up at my work and called me a crack whore.<eos> In front of Melissa!<eos> Well, you know what?<eos> I didn't know!<eos> I was afraid you were living with a biker gang or something.
In front of Melissa!<eos> Well, you know what?<eos> I didn't know!<eos> I was afraid you were living with a biker gang or something.<eos> You can't imagine all the stuff running through my head... from the shit that Polly told me.
Well, you know what?<eos> I didn't know!<eos> I was afraid you were living with a biker gang or something.<eos> You can't imagine all the stuff running through my head... from the shit that Polly told me.<eos> You talked to Polly?
Because this is exactly what she wants!<eos> I am cooling out.<eos> Doesn't know a goddamn thing about my business.<eos> I always told you that she was a nightmare, remember?<eos> Wilson, you said that about everybody.
Doesn't know a goddamn thing about my business.<eos> I always told you that she was a nightmare, remember?<eos> Wilson, you said that about everybody.<eos> Was I wrong?<eos> What do you want, Wilson?
Huh? Can this really be the same Pippi who used to... smoke and drink and curse and fart and belch?<eos> She was a disgusting pig.<eos> Well, there was never a dull moment, that's for sure.<eos> Pippi?<eos> You were the only person who ever bothered to get to know the real me.
And I think that maybe... maybe I still know her.<eos> It's been really hard.<eos> I had some bad years.<eos> I am so... proud of you.<eos> You're doing so good.
It's been really hard.<eos> I had some bad years.<eos> I am so... proud of you.<eos> You're doing so good.<eos> You're an amazing woman.
Pepper, down.<eos> Fuck!<eos> What?<eos> Sorry, she's a little bit overprotective.<eos> Shit, I can't believe you still live here.
Fuck!<eos> What?<eos> Sorry, she's a little bit overprotective.<eos> Shit, I can't believe you still live here.<eos> Oh, I know, it's great, but... you know, I can't help but think it would've been great if you just... had the baby, and then we'd... still have lived together all those years.
Shit, I can't believe you still live here.<eos> Oh, I know, it's great, but... you know, I can't help but think it would've been great if you just... had the baby, and then we'd... still have lived together all those years.<eos> And who knows what our life might have been like.<eos> P T.A. meetings... Guinea pigs... Piano lessons...<eos> You're totally out of your mind, man.

What?<eos> I had a little girl.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I put her up for adoption... before I went to L.A.<eos> Pippi... you need to tell me right now if you're joking around.
What are you talking about?<eos> I put her up for adoption... before I went to L.A.<eos> Pippi... you need to tell me right now if you're joking around.<eos> Wilson, we sent you papers.<eos> No, I don't know anything about what you're talking about.
Pippi... you need to tell me right now if you're joking around.<eos> Wilson, we sent you papers.<eos> No, I don't know anything about what you're talking about.<eos> She got adopted.<eos> You had a baby?
Don't get me wrong, it's, really... nice.<eos> Very tasteful. I just...<eos> It's a sublet, dumbass!<eos> Thank God.<eos> So... what do you want to do about this?
Wilson, I've seen it.<eos> Don't you do another goddamn thing.<eos> I can't even catch my breath around you.<eos> I'm not talking about anything major, Pippi.<eos> I mean... don't you want to see her in the flesh?
Don't you do another goddamn thing.<eos> I can't even catch my breath around you.<eos> I'm not talking about anything major, Pippi.<eos> I mean... don't you want to see her in the flesh?<eos> What are you saying now?
I can't even catch my breath around you.<eos> I'm not talking about anything major, Pippi.<eos> I mean... don't you want to see her in the flesh?<eos> What are you saying now?<eos> What do you want to do, stalk her?
I mean... don't you want to see her in the flesh?<eos> What are you saying now?<eos> What do you want to do, stalk her?<eos> Holy Christ, Pippi.<eos> Where do you come up with this shit?
29 stitches. Yeah.<eos> That almost scared me away.<eos> They're on the move! They're on the move.<eos> Wait!<eos> What are you doing?
Wait!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I told you.<eos> I just want to get a glimpse of her.<eos> But you just saw her!
Hi, Claire.<eos> What's up, Claire?<eos> Why are you here? They having a sale on big-ass clown clothes?<eos> Go die, asshole.<eos> I'm sorry, what did you say to me?
Why are you here? They having a sale on big-ass clown clothes?<eos> Go die, asshole.<eos> I'm sorry, what did you say to me?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> What did you say to me, bitch?
I never was on the street.<eos> Look, it doesn't...<eos> Don't get bogged down in the details right now.<eos> We're just thrilled to finally have the opportunity to get to meet you!<eos> And if you're wondering about the lack of family resemblance... you couldn't tell it by looking at her, but she used to be a real hippo.
Okay.<eos> Bye.<eos> Bye.<eos> I'm not some strung-out skank, man!<eos> Pippi, is that all that you took from this experience?
I'm not some strung-out skank, man!<eos> Pippi, is that all that you took from this experience?<eos> Well, we just totally ambushed her!<eos> I thought we were just gonna hide out.<eos> I can honestly say... I have never seen anything more beautiful... than the look on your face... when you first saw her.
Pippi, is that all that you took from this experience?<eos> Well, we just totally ambushed her!<eos> I thought we were just gonna hide out.<eos> I can honestly say... I have never seen anything more beautiful... than the look on your face... when you first saw her.<eos> You were... glowing.
And I'll let her go.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I think you're right, Pippi.<eos> She certainly doesn't need any help from us.<eos> It's like she has that miserable, anguished look... like you had when I first met you.
Thanks.<eos> I think you're right, Pippi.<eos> She certainly doesn't need any help from us.<eos> It's like she has that miserable, anguished look... like you had when I first met you.<eos> Of course, you turned out okay.
In the long run.<eos> Oh, Pippi.<eos> Oh, Pippi!<eos> Hi, there.<eos> What do you want?
Monika.<eos> Now, is there like a creepy teacher or janitor or...?<eos> Mr. Naisbitt.<eos> Okay.<eos> "Monika, Monika, you blow "Mr. Naisbitt like a harmonica."
Okay.<eos> "Monika, Monika, you blow "Mr. Naisbitt like a harmonica."<eos> You see how that rhymed?<eos> That's just a bonus.<eos> No, "you blow Mr. Naisbitt's syphilitic dong "like a harmonica."
Eaugh!<eos> Too far.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You passed my house.<eos> How could you tell?
Look.<eos> For better or worse, Pippi, we have totally freaked this girl out.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And it is our duty to make sure that she doesn't have some major meltdown.<eos> You know? I mean, can you imagine what she's going through?
Wilson.<eos> And how many times do I have to tell you what I'm going through, huh?<eos> I am barely making it through each day.<eos> And you're expecting this huge emotional commitment... while you're dragging me along for this insane fucking insta-family?<eos> Pippi, it is that commitment... that is exactly what you need to help you move forward.
I am barely making it through each day.<eos> And you're expecting this huge emotional commitment... while you're dragging me along for this insane fucking insta-family?<eos> Pippi, it is that commitment... that is exactly what you need to help you move forward.<eos> Trust me, I know.<eos> You're an asshole!
Goddamn it!<eos> Calm yourself.<eos> Fuck!<eos> This is why I left you in the first place.<eos> You think you know it all.
Calm yourself.<eos> Fuck!<eos> This is why I left you in the first place.<eos> You think you know it all.<eos> You don't know shit about shit!
You don't know shit about shit!<eos> Are you done?<eos> Wow!<eos> So cool!<eos> You must have been here a million times, huh?
It's all ours then.<eos> Thank you.<eos> This used to seem so huge when I was a kid.<eos> Hey, you guys ready to take it for a spin?<eos> You're embarrassing her.
What a day!<eos> Can you imagine... how much bird feces is in this park?<eos> What time is it?<eos> Well...<eos> Don't you have your phone?
No, it's just she's all desperate and needy.<eos> She can tell when someone doesn't love her.<eos> Not the dog, stupid.<eos> Who, Claire?<eos> Did you see the way she was looking at you?
No, no, don't laugh.<eos> We have to do that.<eos> I am not going to her stupid suburban shithole life.<eos> But there's nothing nuts about that.<eos> Look, look, just... all of the shit that you've been through... and you've come out the other side better than she'll ever be.

I'm an actual human being.<eos> "I can do math and...<eos> "drive a car and cook food and do tiddlywinks...<eos> "and masturbate."<eos> I didn't know you were married.
They don't give a shit.<eos> They're just thrilled I have a fucking friend.<eos> Okay... this is a family outing.<eos> That's just how I talk.<eos> Okay, well, in that case... Swear all the fuck you want!
They're just thrilled I have a fucking friend.<eos> Okay... this is a family outing.<eos> That's just how I talk.<eos> Okay, well, in that case... Swear all the fuck you want!<eos> You're fucking crazy.
Come in.<eos> Please.<eos> Wow.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Hey, Polly... you look great.
You do, too, Will!<eos> Thanks.<eos> What's the boy's name?<eos> Cooper.<eos> Cooper! The last time I saw you... you were two or three years old.
Thanks.<eos> What's the boy's name?<eos> Cooper.<eos> Cooper! The last time I saw you... you were two or three years old.<eos> You were trying to get your mom to pick up some Legos and... you were literally just freaking out!
I totally forgot.<eos> So is she my cousin?<eos> Oh, brilliant, Watson!<eos> Definite college material.<eos> What are you gonna major in, brain surgery?
I feel like I'm doing fieldwork among the natives or something.<eos> We shouldn't have come here.<eos> What?<eos> She'll always find a way to win.<eos> What are you talking about?
Stop it!<eos> Pippi, we're here on vacation.<eos> I can't.<eos> Let's just try to have fun.<eos> You know?
I can't.<eos> Let's just try to have fun.<eos> You know?<eos> Yeah.<eos> How come you're so quiet?
Oh, well, I...<eos> Some of my best times with my mom were spent, um... not saying a word, just... just sitting together in the same room... feeling... the connection.<eos> Like a chemical thing.<eos> You know, I always used to try to imagine what you were like. My "real dad."<eos> Well, I hope you're not too disappointed.
Like a chemical thing.<eos> You know, I always used to try to imagine what you were like. My "real dad."<eos> Well, I hope you're not too disappointed.<eos> Nah.<eos> You're cool.
And I also know that things were tougher for you after I left.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Maybe they were a little bit tougher for me?<eos> Yeah.<eos> So, it's good to see you wanting a family.
They're really cool with me.<eos> Do Claire's parents even know where she is, Pippi?<eos> Oh, my God, Polly!<eos> Look at you!<eos> You're still just playing Little Miss Perfect.
Kissing Dad's ass, staying all quiet while I spoke up for the both of us... and I'm the low-life scumbag?<eos> I knew I shouldn't have come back here.<eos> I heard Claire on the phone this morning.<eos> She told her mom she was staying at a beach house with her friend Hannah.<eos> You're a fucking cunt!
Oh, oh, oh!<eos> Look.<eos> A little woodland creature.<eos> You know, they haven't changed at all since the time of the dinosaurs.<eos> Oh, you're so cute.
She is just 17.<eos> Whose side are you on?<eos> Don't worry.<eos> We'll let them cool down and then we'll work something out.<eos> You got a clean record.
Did they charge her with something?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I heard they offered her some deal.<eos> Damn it!<eos> What are you looking at?
It's like the ultimate argument ender.<eos> Like, "No, I don't want your fucking job. In fact...<eos> "I want to destroy your entire society.<eos> "Fuck you."<eos> What'd you say, bitch?
"He leadeth me beside the still waters."<eos> He leadeth me beside the still waters.<eos> "He restoreth my soul."<eos> He restoreth my soul.<eos> So I grabbed this asshole by the lapels... and I said, "Look, I don't care if you are a nun...
"I'm gonna fucking, shit, fucking punch..."<eos> Fuck, yeah!<eos> Wassup, bro? Hey.<eos> How you doing, man?<eos> You staying out of trouble?
Gave me the shits earlier.<eos> There's more pieces than there is puzzle left. Look.<eos> These are that color and there ain't no blanks in that color.<eos> Hey, Wilson!<eos> You got a visitor.
Yeah, but I should've been up there fighting for you.<eos> I wondered about that.<eos> I could've been there for you, and I...<eos> I totally failed you, Wilson.<eos> But you're here now.
I totally failed you, Wilson.<eos> But you're here now.<eos> I am.<eos> And I have to thank you, Wilson.<eos> You believed in me when nobody else ever did.
And that's why...<eos> Tucker and I are moving to Australia.<eos> What did...?<eos> I just... Could you...?<eos> Did you...? Did you...?
Hey.<eos> Maybe we don't have to be miserable forever.<eos> Maybe we could find our way to being happy.<eos> Pippi?<eos> What the fuck are you looking at?
So...<eos> What's been going on in the world?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Tell me, friend, have you heard the good news?
That's my ex.<eos> No, here's the dog.<eos> Oh, she's cool.<eos> It's so nice talking with someone who isn't fucking psychotic!<eos> You know?
Is that you, Diana?<eos> It's me, Wilson.<eos> Pepper's dad!<eos> Hi.<eos> You can't believe what happened to me, Shelly.
She got so sick, Wilson. And in the end she could barely even...<eos> She could barely even lift her little head.<eos> I tried to find you.<eos> I did.<eos> And someone said that you were in jail, and I just...
I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry, Pepper.<eos> I'll never use this voice again.<eos> Good-bye, Pepper.<eos> You were a true friend.
I'll never use this voice again.<eos> Good-bye, Pepper.<eos> You were a true friend.<eos> Every minute in your presence was a blessing and your joy over the simplest of pleasures was humbling and inspirational.<eos> You were the pride of the neighborhood, the brightener of a thousand days.
You...<eos> Urinated.<eos> Urinated... on my address book and chewed up two sofas...<eos> Three.<eos> Three, but... in doing so, you taught us the utter worthlessness of those things.
Diego?<eos> He turned out to be a real asshole.<eos> Oh, jeez, I knew it!<eos> You know, those guys who come off all emotional and caring, they're bad news.<eos> You deserve to be treated with respect.
So what was prison like?<eos> They say that there's no such thing as rehabilitation and people come out worse than they go in, but I... kind of feel like it helped... turn me into an adult.<eos> Finally.<eos> Breathe.<eos> You're so tight.
You're so tight.<eos> Flip over on your tummy.<eos> Tummy, okay.<eos> I think that you and I have a lot to teach each other.<eos> Huh. You're so open and fearless.
It might be George about tomorrow.<eos> Hello?<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> Look, he has no interest in talking to you, and we'd... just prefer if you don't call this number anymore, okay?
Thank you.<eos> Who the hell was that?<eos> Wow.<eos> Hi.<eos> You look so... grown up.
Wow.<eos> Hi.<eos> You look so... grown up.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You look good, too.
Hi.<eos> You look so... grown up.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You look good, too.<eos> Well, you know, if you'd have seen me when I first got out... forty months of eating pure crap and... sitting in a little room with a window this wide...
Yeah.<eos> She emailed me before she left.<eos> Yeah, like they don't have cocaine in Australia or something.<eos> Look, Claire, I'm gonna need some kind of apology or something.<eos> Some acknowledgement of the unconscionable way that you turned on me at the trial.
But... it's not why I'm here.<eos> I'm going to have a baby.<eos> And I thought I should tell you in person.<eos> I guess I wanted to know if he was gonna have any weird diseases or something.<eos> But I mean, you're just a kid yourself.
What are you talking about?<eos> I can't move to Portland.<eos> Oh, no, I know.<eos> I wasn't, you know, suggesting...<eos> I know this is a really emotional issue for you... but you have to accept that she's not your daughter.
I can't move to Portland.<eos> Oh, no, I know.<eos> I wasn't, you know, suggesting...<eos> I know this is a really emotional issue for you... but you have to accept that she's not your daughter.<eos> You barely know her and... she sent you to jail, for Chrissake!
They don't need any more stress right now.<eos> Let me just pet him.<eos> Sit tight. I'll be there in 10 minutes. Hi!<eos> Hello!<eos> You are such a beautiful girl.
Um, you know, actually it's okay.<eos> Yeah, false alarm.<eos> No, I'm sorry.<eos> Thanks very much.<eos> What are you still doing here?
Yeah, false alarm.<eos> No, I'm sorry.<eos> Thanks very much.<eos> What are you still doing here?<eos> My mom said you were beating off.
What are you still doing here?<eos> My mom said you were beating off.<eos> No, I...<eos> I know... that I fucked everything up.<eos> I'm just asking for the tiniest... shred of hope that you might someday... let me be a small part of your life.
My mom said you were beating off.<eos> No, I...<eos> I know... that I fucked everything up.<eos> I'm just asking for the tiniest... shred of hope that you might someday... let me be a small part of your life.<eos> What do you mean?
Claire?<eos> Can I at least come visit you?<eos> The little fucker might like me.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You know, I really have to just take stock of my life.
Start counting my blessings.<eos> The fact is, I got it pretty good here with you, Shelly.<eos> You know, I mean, we all want people to love us for exactly who we are.<eos> But that's not really possible in this world because we're just all too unbearable. You know?<eos> We got to... make the best of what we have, you know?
The fact is, I got it pretty good here with you, Shelly.<eos> You know, I mean, we all want people to love us for exactly who we are.<eos> But that's not really possible in this world because we're just all too unbearable. You know?<eos> We got to... make the best of what we have, you know?<eos> I thought you were moving to Portland.
For a while.<eos> Have we arrived in time to save you from each other?<eos> The only person I need saving from is you.<eos> I came for the child, not you.<eos> Then you'll have to fight me for him.
And I'll join you as soon as I can.<eos> I'm scared, Uther.<eos> I have the sword.<eos> Hurry.<eos> How do you know of this place, my love?
I have the sword.<eos> Hurry.<eos> How do you know of this place, my love?<eos> You must tell me where we're going.<eos> Why do you not answer me?
There is no ambiguity, my Lord.<eos> We kept our side of the covenant.<eos> It was you who lost the boy, and the sword.<eos> Have I not sacrificed enough?<eos> And have you not felt your power increase?
It was you who lost the boy, and the sword.<eos> Have I not sacrificed enough?<eos> And have you not felt your power increase?<eos> With every kingdom conquered, with every level added to your tower.<eos> When it is capped with the silver from Gaul, you will have what you wanted.
When it is capped with the silver from Gaul, you will have what you wanted.<eos> Find the boy.<eos> Kill him.<eos> And the sword will answer only to you.<eos> If you desire further help, you know the price.
Yes, gentlemen?<eos> A turner come down this way.<eos> We're searching all houses.<eos> Whoa. Slow down, new boy, before you trip up.<eos> What did you say?
I'm gonna take your hands for that.<eos> Sergeant!<eos> What did I tell you about this establishment?<eos> He touched me, sir.<eos> Well, you should count yourself lucky.
Mind if I take a look?<eos> He's bleeding.<eos> Took an arrow on the way out.<eos> What would happen to a man who hits the king's barge upriver?<eos> Well, you know what would happen.
What would happen to the people harboring such a man?<eos> Well, they get treated the same as the man they hide.<eos> Would they, now?<eos> Not sure you're too welcome here, mate.<eos> You're in safe hands now, no need to worry.
Not sure you're too welcome here, mate.<eos> You're in safe hands now, no need to worry.<eos> In the back room, now.<eos> What's this all about, Jack? What's it got to do with us?<eos> Do you have any idea who that man is?
My mum's sewing circle.<eos> I'm a Blackleg sergeant, stupid.<eos> What circles do you think?<eos> Now, tell me a story about a girl called Lucy, a Viking called Greybeard, and some rebel graffiti dirtying these walls.<eos> Are you writing a book?
- I did.<eos> They don't speak English good.<eos> They speak it better than you.<eos> Hold up, hold up. Back up.<eos> Are you sure you didn't see someone else before you saw George?
All right, Mike.<eos> Mike the Spike?<eos> Kosher Mike?<eos> Which Mike?<eos> You're giving me a headache.
Why have enemies when you can have friends?<eos> - Where'd you put the money?<eos> - What money? - Money?<eos> - What money?<eos> Did you hide it with the rest of your coffers?
- What money? - Money?<eos> - What money?<eos> Did you hide it with the rest of your coffers?<eos> You're all over the place. You can't keep your questions in a straight line.<eos> I'm trying to tell a story here and you keep interrupting.
Anyway, I don't have any coffers.<eos> Once you've taken your share, and I've looked after the weak and needy, I'm left broke.<eos> Mike and the furs.<eos> So we're back to that story, are we now, Jack?<eos> - What are you doing, Mike?
Don't pass it to me, Mike.<eos> It doesn't work like that.<eos> Give it to Wet Stick.<eos> I'm Back Lack.<eos> What are you giving it to me for?
Oi! What are you lot doing?<eos> Don't start getting the wrong end of the stick, Jack.<eos> He's an upstanding citizen.<eos> I think I found something that belongs to you, Lack.<eos> What you doing, boy?
He's coming back.<eos> Who's coming back?<eos> The born king.<eos> Yeah, and when he does, he'll spank your arse.<eos> Now, let's get your hands clean while you still got some.
Yeah, and when he does, he'll spank your arse.<eos> Now, let's get your hands clean while you still got some.<eos> He'll cut 'em off and have you in chains.<eos> If we can catch you, they can catch you.<eos> If you can catch him, so can we.
- They hurt Lucy.<eos> - My Lucy?<eos> - That can't happen, Jack.<eos> That can never happen, Jack.<eos> You see, she's a friend of mine.
I feel a joke coming on here.<eos> You ask him for it.<eos> You're paying and then you're leaving.<eos> Nobody's talking to you, sweetheart.<eos> You sit there and be quiet. You are better at that...
You're paying and then you're leaving.<eos> Nobody's talking to you, sweetheart.<eos> You sit there and be quiet. You are better at that...<eos> Or I'll have to put an arrow through your lard-loving thigh.<eos> You were unarmed. You just walked in there and asked them for it?
More is always better than less, Mike.<eos> Old Greybeard banged on for a bit.<eos> I got 50 seasoned men of war.<eos> You could shave a pig on the edge of our blades.<eos> If you were unarmed, where'd you find the blade to put to his throat?
Because for the first time, there's something you don't know.<eos> Something nobody told you.<eos> And that is?<eos> They're under the protection of the king.<eos> And once you're under the protection of the king, I can't help you.
Finish the tower.<eos> Everything else will be academic.<eos> Thank you, Maggie.<eos> Wake up!<eos> You must control it.
Wake up!<eos> You must control it.<eos> Wake up!<eos> Listen!<eos> You need to get out of here, now!
You must control it.<eos> Wake up!<eos> Listen!<eos> You need to get out of here, now!<eos> What are you doing, Lack?
What are you doing, Lack?<eos> Jack's Eye was telling the truth. Those red beards are connected.<eos> So, what?<eos> So are we.<eos> No, you don't understand.
So are we.<eos> No, you don't understand.<eos> The Blacklegs are coming.<eos> And when they get here, they're gonna make an example out of you.<eos> You gotta go now.
Open the door!<eos> Oi, you two, in the back!<eos> Kick the door down!<eos> All right, fellas?<eos> Hello, boy. What are you doing out at this time?
Hello, boy. What are you doing out at this time?<eos> I work on the boats, sir.<eos> Out on the first tide.<eos> The boats, eh? What's in the bag?<eos> And you're about the right age.
Show us your brand.<eos> Have you not been tested?<eos> I'm always at sea, sir. Haven't had the chance.<eos> Well, that's about to change now.<eos> You're going on a boat, all right.
Have you not been tested?<eos> I'm always at sea, sir. Haven't had the chance.<eos> Well, that's about to change now.<eos> You're going on a boat, all right.<eos> Just not the one you think.
Come on, get 'em off.<eos> Get your brand, get your drink, then back on the barge!<eos> Move!<eos> What's all that about?<eos> Guess that's what you get when you don't pay up.
What's all that about?<eos> Guess that's what you get when you don't pay up.<eos> Taking the kids now.<eos> What's he got them all penned up out here for?<eos> Well, when you see the king, why don't you ask him?
As you were, mate.<eos> All right, where do you want me?<eos> Trigger, I think we got one here.<eos> Bouncing on my knee.<eos> Where do you think I want you?
Blacklegs in his pockets, too.<eos> I'll deal with this.<eos> My king...<eos> Carefully.<eos> So you're Uther's son.
I'll deal with this.<eos> My king...<eos> Carefully.<eos> So you're Uther's son.<eos> Not only did you survive in the gutter, you blossomed out of manure.
Not only did you survive in the gutter, you blossomed out of manure.<eos> You've got the wrong man, sire.<eos> I was born in a brothel, on a bridge in Londinium.<eos> The sword can only be drawn by Uther Pendragon or his direct heir.<eos> You felt it, didn't you?
The sword can only be drawn by Uther Pendragon or his direct heir.<eos> You felt it, didn't you?<eos> The power.<eos> That's what put you out.<eos> You just don't know how to control it.
Or any desire to achieve it.<eos> Sire, I could simply drift away, never to be seen again.<eos> As much as I'd like to believe you, your character makes that unlikely.<eos> While you were asleep, we've been busy.<eos> I know what kind of a man you are.
I know your story.<eos> And, I've seen your coffers.<eos> Your achievements now stand<eos> as your prosecution.<eos> What kind of a man would you have become, had you inherited your father's kingdom and all its advantages instead of being raised in a brothel?
as your prosecution.<eos> What kind of a man would you have become, had you inherited your father's kingdom and all its advantages instead of being raised in a brothel?<eos> What gave you such drive?<eos> So, what happens now?<eos> You know what happens now.
What kind of a man would you have become, had you inherited your father's kingdom and all its advantages instead of being raised in a brothel?<eos> What gave you such drive?<eos> So, what happens now?<eos> You know what happens now.<eos> You're quickly becoming a legend.
You know what happens now.<eos> You're quickly becoming a legend.<eos> Someone here to see you.<eos> I think you need to see her.<eos> Do you know who I am?
You're quickly becoming a legend.<eos> Someone here to see you.<eos> I think you need to see her.<eos> Do you know who I am?<eos> I know who you are, Mage.
Do you know who I am?<eos> I know who you are, Mage.<eos> I've seen you in my dreams.<eos> You've been sent by Merlin.<eos> Then you know why I am here.
I know who you are, Mage.<eos> I've seen you in my dreams.<eos> You've been sent by Merlin.<eos> Then you know why I am here.<eos> So, you will be his guide.
I've seen you in my dreams.<eos> You've been sent by Merlin.<eos> Then you know why I am here.<eos> So, you will be his guide.<eos> And you will help me.
There's a crowd of thousands out there.<eos> They've come to see you more than they've come to see me.<eos> I will show them power.<eos> I will show them strength and dignity.<eos> You will show them lies, weakness, and shame.
Behold, your born king.<eos> Behold the man who pulled sword from stone.<eos> You wanted a prophecy.<eos> This is your prophecy.<eos> Now tell us, king, what do you have to say?
When your head rolls to me, the legend you've fast become will just as quickly...<eos> Here are your people.<eos> ...add to the reverence of my name.<eos> And for this, I salute you.<eos> - If you're the king... - No! ...declare yourself.
Here are your people.<eos> ...add to the reverence of my name.<eos> And for this, I salute you.<eos> - If you're the king... - No! ...declare yourself.<eos> The rest of them will follow unless you do what needs to be done.
I said, take it, king.<eos> Raise that sword!<eos> I thought not.<eos> This man cannot be allowed to bring discord to our flourishing nation.<eos> You're not the king!
Raise that sword!<eos> I thought not.<eos> This man cannot be allowed to bring discord to our flourishing nation.<eos> You're not the king!<eos> You're no king!
Get the sword!<eos> Get after him!<eos> Someone gonna tell me where we're going?<eos> No.<eos> So what is it you're looking at, then?
Get after him!<eos> Someone gonna tell me where we're going?<eos> No.<eos> So what is it you're looking at, then?<eos> Are you falling for me like I'm falling for you?
So what is it you're looking at, then?<eos> Are you falling for me like I'm falling for you?<eos> We wanna be careful.<eos> That's a neat trick.<eos> You'll have to teach me how to do that.
You'll have to teach me how to do that.<eos> Put him back on his horse.<eos> Oh, hello.<eos> It's quite dangerous being one of you lot, isn't it?<eos> You're good with animals, aren't you?
You do know I can see through this?<eos> Trees everywhere.<eos> Hang that up.<eos> Don't want it getting creased.<eos> So, you're the chap that turned in Goosefat Bill.
Like I said, your man chose the wrong place to hide.<eos> So it seems.<eos> I was wondering what happened to you.<eos> I told you, you were in safe hands.<eos> You've made quite a celebrity of yourself among the Blackleg ranks.
So it seems.<eos> I was wondering what happened to you.<eos> I told you, you were in safe hands.<eos> You've made quite a celebrity of yourself among the Blackleg ranks.<eos> You've done very nicely on the back of your cozy relationship with your kingsmen.
I told you, you were in safe hands.<eos> You've made quite a celebrity of yourself among the Blackleg ranks.<eos> You've done very nicely on the back of your cozy relationship with your kingsmen.<eos> You know, I'm a little old for finger-wagging and speeches.<eos> So, unless you're my dad, which, I believe, is unlikely, can you just get around to telling me exactly what it is you want?
Put your hands out.<eos> I don't think so, mate.<eos> So I'm not going anywhere, am I?<eos> Where exactly were you thinking of going?<eos> You have no more home.
So I'm not going anywhere, am I?<eos> Where exactly were you thinking of going?<eos> You have no more home.<eos> It was razed days ago.<eos> You've no more life to go back to.
You've no more life to go back to.<eos> Like it or not, this is your lot.<eos> And even we don't like you.<eos> Do we, Goosefat?<eos> But what we are interested in is what you can do with this sword.
But what we are interested in is what you can do with this sword.<eos> Why don't you leave him with me for a minute or two, boss?<eos> Put your ring back on, honey tits.<eos> You haven't had enough porridge this morning to talk like that.<eos> And if you like that sword so much, Your Lordship, you can keep it to peel your grapes.
Is that it?<eos> Run, son!<eos> Wait here, son.<eos> Run, son!<eos> You are resisting the sword.
It should be clear by now that whatever it is that you and your friends think you want from me,<eos> I am not it.<eos> - Not yet.<eos> - Not ever!<eos> What do you see when you hold the sword?
I am not it.<eos> - Not yet.<eos> - Not ever!<eos> What do you see when you hold the sword?<eos> It is something you've seen before, isn't it?
- Not ever!<eos> What do you see when you hold the sword?<eos> It is something you've seen before, isn't it?<eos> Long before you ever touched the sword.<eos> You don't sleep well, do you?
It is something you've seen before, isn't it?<eos> Long before you ever touched the sword.<eos> You don't sleep well, do you?<eos> What if you could make the dreams go away?<eos> You know what we have to do.
- Give me another way.<eos> - There's no other way.<eos> And he has to go alone.<eos> He can't survive the Darklands alone.<eos> - Are you scared?
And he has to go alone.<eos> He can't survive the Darklands alone.<eos> - Are you scared?<eos> - I think I can manage.<eos> You should be scared.
- Are you scared?<eos> - I think I can manage.<eos> You should be scared.<eos> That's what all the fuss is about?<eos> Don't worry, you'll soon understand what all the fuss is about.
Don't worry, you'll soon understand what all the fuss is about.<eos> You don't want all of him to survive.<eos> That's the point.<eos> You have to break his old self completely. Wear him down.<eos> You want him to think big?
That's the point.<eos> You have to break his old self completely. Wear him down.<eos> You want him to think big?<eos> Give him something big to think about.<eos> You're playing with fire, Mage.
And I'm not killing the king before he's even become one.<eos> Wait here, son.<eos> No!<eos> Run, son!<eos> Did you see everything you needed to see?
He then forged the great sword, Excalibur, and destroyed the ancient tower.<eos> The sword was then passed to the Lady of the Lake, who bound it to the Pendragon bloodline.<eos> Now, the sword is yours.<eos> It seems his people have been found by the Resistance.<eos> You have 10,000 men under your command for the purpose of maintaining public order.
Smaller than I thought it'd be.<eos> It's all yours, son.<eos> I warn you, it's got quite a bite.<eos> What they done back home?<eos> You really wanna know?
Go on.<eos> It's all gone.<eos> They torched the lot.<eos> I said, go on.<eos> You should be flattered, mate.
Wet Stick, meet Percival.<eos> Rubio, meet Back Lack.<eos> Sir Bedivere, who runs this aristocratic family of cave dwellers, meet Blue, son of Back Lack.<eos> The infamous Goosefat Bill needs no introduction.<eos> So, you think you can take down Vortigern?
These boats are made out of seasoned oak.<eos> They're uncrackable.<eos> So you need to go through the deck to get to the keel.<eos> No, you need to go through the bulkhead to get to the stern.<eos> What are you doing?
They're uncrackable.<eos> So you need to go through the deck to get to the keel.<eos> No, you need to go through the bulkhead to get to the stern.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You're wasting your time.
I still can't control it.<eos> Pick it up.<eos> You pick it up.<eos> Pick it up with both hands.<eos> Did you see everything you needed to see?
Pick it up with both hands.<eos> Did you see everything you needed to see?<eos> Where?<eos> In the Darklands.<eos> Did you look away?
Did you see everything you needed to see?<eos> Where?<eos> In the Darklands.<eos> Did you look away?<eos> You want to know why you still can't use it.
Where?<eos> In the Darklands.<eos> Did you look away?<eos> You want to know why you still can't use it.<eos> Why don't you tell me?
Did you look away?<eos> You want to know why you still can't use it.<eos> Why don't you tell me?<eos> I think you know the answer.<eos> You will face it when it's worth it to you.
Don't get me wrong, I look away.<eos> We all look away.<eos> But that is the difference between a man and a king.<eos> Maggie!<eos> I thought we agreed that you'd never come here.
There's always more Blacklegs in the Two Hot Cocks than there are rats on the street.<eos> Why don't you use the other building?<eos> The one back here?<eos> Because it's 175 yards away.<eos> And how far can you shoot, Back Lack?
Those two have a history.<eos> Well, whatever it is, that's not what we're here for.<eos> - Is it, Goosefat? - Mmm.<eos> They've arrived.<eos> Maggie, I now realize what an important member of my household you are.
Maggie, I now realize what an important member of my household you are.<eos> - Your Majesty...<eos> - I haven't finished.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Till recently, I didn't recognize what a powerful tool you can be in the right hands.
- I haven't finished.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Till recently, I didn't recognize what a powerful tool you can be in the right hands.<eos> I thought you were simply a pawn.<eos> Turns out you're a far more significant piece.
Stop looking around and look at me.<eos> I'm a target, aren't I?<eos> God help us. They've sent me a buffoon.<eos> You are a cunning old bastard, Vortigern.<eos> But what you fail to understand is that it's you who's fed the hangman that will eventually come for you.
I'm a target, aren't I?<eos> God help us. They've sent me a buffoon.<eos> You are a cunning old bastard, Vortigern.<eos> But what you fail to understand is that it's you who's fed the hangman that will eventually come for you.<eos> You're right, that's not Vortigern.
But what you fail to understand is that it's you who's fed the hangman that will eventually come for you.<eos> You're right, that's not Vortigern.<eos> But at least Mercia's here.<eos> Goosefat.<eos> What have you done?
Goosefat.<eos> What have you done?<eos> You can't shoot if it's a trap!<eos> They'll never know where that came from.<eos> You missed him anyway.
Arrow!<eos> What are you doing? They're not targets at a fair!<eos> That was Clarendon.<eos> He earned that.<eos> You might survive today.
Don't like rats, boss.<eos> Dell.<eos> Scared of the dark.<eos> Really?<eos> George, will you tell them?
I love you, mate.<eos> Come on, let's get going.<eos> Run!<eos> Down with Vortigern!<eos> It seems as though you found a way to use the sword.
I can.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Something's happening, you know?<eos> Certainly sounds like it.<eos> People have seen what you can do.
Thank you.<eos> Something's happening, you know?<eos> Certainly sounds like it.<eos> People have seen what you can do.<eos> You're no longer a myth.
Something's happening, you know?<eos> Certainly sounds like it.<eos> People have seen what you can do.<eos> You're no longer a myth.<eos> You're starting to mean something.
They are fighting in your name.<eos> I don't wanna wear that.<eos> Is that you, Blue?<eos> Yes, boss!<eos> Did you find your father?
No, follow him.<eos> The blood he followed was from a man who killed one of my sergeants today.<eos> A man who fled the scene of an assassination attempt on me.<eos> On me, no less.<eos> You wouldn't happen to know where that man is, would you?
I usually come in later, you know, do the dishes when they're all gone.<eos> Is that the truth?<eos> Yes, sir. I'd never lie to a Blackleg.<eos> Good boy.<eos> So you don't know him?
Let him go.<eos> Take the boy and...<eos> Crush the Resistance tonight!<eos> Archers!<eos> Let me show you what your uncle will do if you do not accept
George, I need you to go to Londinium, gather the lads.<eos> Where's the Mage?<eos> She's back at the cave.<eos> All right.<eos> Now, when you say we're going to take the castle, what does that mean?
It was my turn to cook tonight.<eos> I've been sent by His Majesty to deliver a message.<eos> Let's think...<eos> "Be at the castle before dark"<eos> "if you wanna see the girl and the boy"
"if you wanna see the girl and the boy"<eos> "alive."<eos> I would love to stay and chat, but you do understand the situation between me and my wife.<eos> Anything that you do to me will be repaid 10 times in kind.<eos> Now, you're a big man.
I don't have to remind you of what will happen if he doesn't come.<eos> I'll start with the little boy.<eos> Now, take the girl and go.<eos> This venom will induce that which is hidden from you.<eos> It will show you things you do not want to see.
I'll start with the little boy.<eos> Now, take the girl and go.<eos> This venom will induce that which is hidden from you.<eos> It will show you things you do not want to see.<eos> But you'll need its protection.
That's far enough.<eos> Let's get this done quickly, shall we?<eos> Put him on his knees.<eos> Put him on his knees!<eos> You know the price.
What's going on?<eos> Father, you're scaring me.<eos> I love you very much.<eos> Charge!<eos> You have won, nephew.
Father, you're scaring me.<eos> I love you very much.<eos> Charge!<eos> You have won, nephew.<eos> You have won.
I think that sword belongs to me now.<eos> Run, son!<eos> Brother...<eos> I think that sword belongs to me now.<eos> Whatever price you pay, it will be more than you know.
Run, son!<eos> Brother...<eos> I think that sword belongs to me now.<eos> Whatever price you pay, it will be more than you know.<eos> You don't need to run anymore.
We expect to leave here with 10,000 young men as agreed.<eos> Yeah, I don't think so, mate.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> I said, "I don't think so, mate."<eos> We've been wondering what you were doing in here.
What are you supposed to do with it?<eos> I know.<eos> It's a dance floor.<eos> And once you finish it, how are you supposed to get to the middle?<eos> But how did you get it through the door?
It's a dance floor.<eos> And once you finish it, how are you supposed to get to the middle?<eos> But how did you get it through the door?<eos> Did you carry it in?<eos> Or did you roll it in?
I like my face.<eos> It don't matter?<eos> It's a work of art right here.<eos> All right, man.<eos> Whatever you say.
Yeah, we'll know by 4:00.<eos> Yeah, this is Officer Watson.<eos> Dr. Sorenson.<eos> Ruby.<eos> You missed our appointment this morning.
Guys at the department are concerned about your recent behavior.<eos> The guys at the department?<eos> The whole damn department is gossiping about me.<eos> Well...<eos> How does that make you feel?
Good. Good.<eos> So you know I have to get back to work.<eos> I have to figure this thing out.<eos> 'Cause this city is crawling with dirty cops.<eos> Do you hear that?
And I mean everywhere.<eos> Oh, we'll take that.<eos> Me and Cass.<eos> No, no. I'm giving it to Emerson and Flannigan.<eos> You want Cagney and Lacey to take it or you wanna get it solved?
All right, hotshot, it's yours.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Let's go, partner.<eos> Hey, say, nigga, are you high?<eos> What the fuck are you doing?
Maybe you shouldn't think, Bryant.<eos> Me and my partner got the call.<eos> You did?<eos> Anyway, I was just looking out for a fellow officer.<eos> You should put some ice on that. Yeah. Yeah.
Sorry. I was grabbing you some... Some flowers.<eos> That's why I was running late.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What's that?<eos> I was gonna tell you, but you kept canceling.
What kind of ring is this?<eos> It's an engagement ring.<eos> It's from Dave? Yeah, it's Dave.<eos> Who else would it be?<eos> D, what are you doing?
It's from Dave? Yeah, it's Dave.<eos> Who else would it be?<eos> D, what are you doing?<eos> What am I...<eos> What are you doing?
Who else would it be?<eos> D, what are you doing?<eos> What am I...<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Is this somebody you want to spend the rest of your life with?
D, what are you doing?<eos> What am I...<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Is this somebody you want to spend the rest of your life with?<eos> Have you thought this out?
Dave takes care of your son.<eos> I don't care how many times he shows up.<eos> He ain't his father. I'm his father.<eos> I know you are.<eos> You gotta respect that, D.
Okay, D.<eos> All right. All right.<eos> Look, he's got to go.<eos> His game is now.<eos> You got to pick him up 'cause I got stuff I got to do...
His game is now.<eos> You got to pick him up 'cause I got stuff I got to do...<eos> No, no. Not again.<eos> Not again. Not again.<eos> You go pick him up.
No, no. Not again.<eos> Not again. Not again.<eos> You go pick him up.<eos> I have to work a double.<eos> You got to figure it out.

Hey, son.<eos> Want some flowers?<eos> How come you didn't tell me about Dave?<eos> How come you didn't tell me he coming around more?<eos> You should have told me that. We men.
How come you didn't tell me about Dave?<eos> How come you didn't tell me he coming around more?<eos> You should have told me that. We men.<eos> Supposed to be man-to-man on that.<eos> You supposed to let me know what's going on.
Well, he's moving in next week.<eos> No, no.<eos> No, ain't nobody doing that. Not doing that.<eos> Not doing that.<eos> You need a place to stay, you gonna come stay with me.

You got room.<eos> Yeah, I got room.<eos> What am I, a piece of furniture?<eos> You don't care where I live, who I live with.<eos> You were never home when Mom and I lived with you!
It just gets complicated.<eos> Radio don't work.<eos> Take it out.<eos> Remember what I told you to do with that.<eos> You pull that trigger, you better have your mind made up.
Take it out.<eos> Remember what I told you to do with that.<eos> You pull that trigger, you better have your mind made up.<eos> 'Cause you can't take it back.<eos> And whatever you aiming at, make sure you prepared to kill it.
Hey, this is Bryant.<eos> I need a file on an officer.<eos> Vincent Downs.<eos> Contact information, license plate, family info.<eos> What can you give me without approval?
Thank you.<eos> What's up with you?<eos> You all right?<eos> Man, where all this blood come from?<eos> You messed up, Cass.

You fucked up.<eos> What the fuck...<eos> See, we weren't stealing from Rubino.<eos> You were stealing from Novak.<eos> You got us fucked up in some Novak shit!
Man, they gonna kill...<eos> They gonna...<eos> I know what they doin'!<eos> I need that bag!<eos> Hey, listen, you know I wouldn't do that shit on purpose!
They gonna...<eos> I know what they doin'!<eos> I need that bag!<eos> Hey, listen, you know I wouldn't do that shit on purpose!<eos> Then why'd you do it?
Then why'd you do it?<eos> Hey, man, I didn't know!<eos> Man, I love Thomas like he my own!<eos> Had one day with him!<eos> Hey, listen, I understand you upset.
Hey, listen, I understand you upset.<eos> Man, I'll fix it.<eos> Calm down.<eos> Get the bag.<eos> I can't believe you thought I'd do some shit like that, man.
I can't believe you thought I'd do some shit like that, man.<eos> I hit you when I'm on the way back.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Rob.<eos> You don't have to do this.
Please!<eos> Please. Please.<eos> Okay, I am sorry, okay?<eos> I am so, so sorry.<eos> You don't...
Listen, you dumb motherfucker, you think that we don't have people who we pay to tell us when our relatives call the fucking DEA?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I was with this girl in Agua Prieta, all right?<eos> And the DEA, they busted us and they asked me all these questions.<eos> You know what my father always said about your side of the family?
And the DEA, they busted us and they asked me all these questions.<eos> You know what my father always said about your side of the family?<eos> You only think with your dick.<eos> It's always this fat girl and that fat girl.<eos> And that's why you turned out so stupid.
It's always this fat girl and that fat girl.<eos> And that's why you turned out so stupid.<eos> 'Cause your daddy married your mom and fucked her.<eos> Sweet lady.<eos> But not the kind of face you want to look at for the rest of your life.
It's embarrassing.<eos> Even worse...<eos> The whole goddamn world knows I'm vulnerable.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Yeah, I know you are.
Cut off his tongue.<eos> Make sure he doesn't ever use it again.<eos> No, no. Rob!<eos> Rob, come back!<eos> You can't do this. Please!
So I think he's just punishing me right now.<eos> What kind of fight, Vin?<eos> I don't know.<eos> He was just being him, you know?<eos> And I'm sure you were just being you. Yeah.
Dad!<eos> What's goin' on?<eos> It's gonna be okay.<eos> Come on, man.<eos> You steal from me...
What's goin' on?<eos> It's gonna be okay.<eos> Come on, man.<eos> You steal from me...<eos> And you kill my guys.
And you kill my guys.<eos> Let's just figure it out.<eos> You stupid shit.<eos> This is the biggest amount I ever moved.<eos> You think I wouldn't protect it with everything I've got?
You stupid shit.<eos> This is the biggest amount I ever moved.<eos> You think I wouldn't protect it with everything I've got?<eos> Look, we didn't know the drugs was yours.<eos> You have no idea what kind of mess you've made here.
You think I wouldn't protect it with everything I've got?<eos> Look, we didn't know the drugs was yours.<eos> You have no idea what kind of mess you've made here.<eos> That cocaine is supposed to go to the Novaks.<eos> You know what they're capable of.
I'll bring it back in 10 minutes, get my son.<eos> No, where am I going?<eos> Dad!<eos> Ten minutes.<eos> How do I know if I bring you that coke, you don't give my son back?
How do I know if I bring you that coke, you don't give my son back?<eos> Shall we?<eos> Hello?<eos> I followed Vincent Downs to the Luxus.<eos> What do you mean, you followed Vincent Downs?
Hello?<eos> I followed Vincent Downs to the Luxus.<eos> What do you mean, you followed Vincent Downs?<eos> We discussed it.<eos> You said he was worth looking into.
So I'm saying he was worth looking into.<eos> Okay, seal off the bathroom.<eos> I'm on my way.<eos> I took it out of the bathroom.<eos> You moved evidence without properly conducting an investigation?
Hey, how's the old man?<eos> He's good.<eos> Ten.<eos> Here we go again.<eos> Whatever you're looking for, that lady cop was already in there.
Ten.<eos> Here we go again.<eos> Whatever you're looking for, that lady cop was already in there.<eos> Shit!<eos> What do you mean, she was already in there, huh?
Whatever you're looking for, that lady cop was already in there.<eos> Shit!<eos> What do you mean, she was already in there, huh?<eos> She have a garbage bag?<eos> You don't hear me?
Something wrong?<eos> No.<eos> Everything's fine.<eos> I got a great 25-year-old bottle of Macallan up there with your name on it.<eos> What do you say?
Stanley, how much longer?<eos> A few minutes.<eos> A few minutes?<eos> Here's the thing.<eos> You know my family.
25 kilos.<eos> Your 25 kilos.<eos> I was just trying to help.<eos> No, Stanley.<eos> When you made me the offer, you were helping me out.
Your 25 kilos.<eos> I was just trying to help.<eos> No, Stanley.<eos> When you made me the offer, you were helping me out.<eos> But when I promised my father that I had it all covered, then you became obligated.
Clearly, this ties in to our crime scene this morning.<eos> Why, because we've got a police-issued bullet at the crime scene, and because Downs comes here and shoves a ton of cocaine into the bathroom ceiling?<eos> Then he killed the guy. Yes.<eos> Okay, he's our guy.<eos> Where'd you put the drugs?
Do you have him? Yeah.<eos> Got a text from him.<eos> Said he was going to meet some shorty at the Luxus casino.<eos> What girl?<eos> You know, the...
With the girl.<eos> The girl... The girl he always with.<eos> The girl...<eos> He doesn't have a girl.<eos> Well, maybe he don't want you to know who the girl is.
The girl...<eos> He doesn't have a girl.<eos> Well, maybe he don't want you to know who the girl is.<eos> I know you, Vin, and I know your voice.<eos> And I know you're not telling me the whole story, are you?
They follow you?<eos> Think so.<eos> And, uh, it's narcotics.<eos> They know we're up here.<eos> How do you know they're narcotics?
They know we're up here.<eos> How do you know they're narcotics?<eos> 'Cause I'm a cop.<eos> Easy.<eos> There something you want to tell me?
Never a dull moment.<eos> But I didn't know this.<eos> I don't really know what's going on.<eos> Truly.<eos> Now, Stanley, you never do.
Come on.<eos> These stairs lead to the garage.<eos> Vincent Downs.<eos> I'll remember that.<eos> You should.
Get the fuck out of my casino.<eos> He's waiting on you.<eos> Damn it.<eos> He must still be here.<eos> Did you check with security? No.
Yeah.<eos> It's over.<eos> Let's get out of here.<eos> Hey, Rob.<eos> What did you think?
What did you think?<eos> 'Cause you and my father used to party together when you were kids that I wouldn't kill you?<eos> What's your problem?<eos> I was just trying to help you out.<eos> You needed some product.
'Cause you and my father used to party together when you were kids that I wouldn't kill you?<eos> What's your problem?<eos> I was just trying to help you out.<eos> You needed some product.<eos> You didn't give me product.
What's your problem?<eos> I was just trying to help you out.<eos> You needed some product.<eos> You didn't give me product.<eos> You gave me sugar.
I have his kid. He'll bring the drugs.<eos> I'll just...<eos> I'll just...<eos> Just give me some time.<eos> Then what are you waiting for?
I'll just...<eos> Just give me some time.<eos> Then what are you waiting for?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Do you still have the kid?
Oh, shit!<eos> It's just a cut. It's just a cut.<eos> I'll be okay.<eos> Just give me a minute.<eos> You stole drugs from them?
It's just a cut. It's just a cut.<eos> I'll be okay.<eos> Just give me a minute.<eos> You stole drugs from them?<eos> What you talking about?
You stole drugs from them?<eos> What you talking about?<eos> That's why you never home.<eos> This your overtime?<eos> Thought you out doing something good, and you out here fucking selling drugs.
I almost got it done.<eos> That's why I haven't been around.<eos> That's why I haven't been able to take you to your games or whatever that is.<eos> And I apologize for that.<eos> You're the only one that knows.
And I apologize for that.<eos> You're the only one that knows.<eos> Okay?<eos> So you got to stay close, and we gonna get out of this.<eos> You just gotta trust me. Yeah.
Come here!<eos> Thomas!<eos> Dad!<eos> Dad!<eos> I swear to God, you little shit, if you make a scene, I'll fucking kill you!
Thomas!<eos> Good news.<eos> Got his son back.<eos> I expect this will all be wrapped up momentarily.<eos> What are you doing here, Stanley?
Good news.<eos> Got his son back.<eos> I expect this will all be wrapped up momentarily.<eos> What are you doing here, Stanley?<eos> You have a job.
What are you doing here, Stanley?<eos> You have a job.<eos> A good one.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Looks like you've done pretty damn well for yourself.
Let me have a water, please.<eos> From what I buy from you for the clients here, I...<eos> I save a little back every month.<eos> That 25 kilos was my safety net.<eos> And why do you need a safety net?
My cousin's.<eos> So look...<eos> My family...<eos> We have a lot of friends.<eos> So there's gonna be nowhere that you can go that we won't be able to find you.
I want you to keep it so it'll remind you of what happens when people think that they're smarter than me.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Fuck!<eos> Fuck!<eos> You get him?
And the product ain't here either. Shit.<eos> Just come down and meet me at the Luxus.<eos> Just get here now.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Who are you?
Just get here now.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Who are you?<eos> Ain't nobody.<eos> Ho. You can't be in here.
What the fuck?<eos> Who are you?<eos> Ain't nobody.<eos> Ho. You can't be in here.<eos> Right. You're right.
Ho. You can't be in here.<eos> Right. You're right.<eos> I'm not even here.<eos> Looks official.<eos> You're not coming in here.
Right. You're right.<eos> I'm not even here.<eos> Looks official.<eos> You're not coming in here.<eos> Look, you got three options, either you let me pass or I'll whup your funny-looking ass or I can arrest you.
He beat us.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> You know, a guy gets beat up on the job, and everyone congratulates him on the size of his balls.<eos> But if I get hit, everyone acts like I need. Scotch tape and a shrink to get put back together.<eos> No, you know what?
But if I get hit, everyone acts like I need. Scotch tape and a shrink to get put back together.<eos> No, you know what?<eos> This isn't about this, all right?<eos> It's about your state of mind.<eos> You missed things that were right in front of you and you put yourself in the wrong place at the wrong time and you almost got yourself killed.
First floor.<eos> Twenty-seventh floor.<eos> Come on, come on, come on.<eos> Twenty-seventh...<eos> What the fuck are you doin'?
What are you doing?<eos> I'm just trying to get to my son.<eos> You dirty son of a bitch.<eos> Get that fucking gun off me.<eos> I knew you were a dirty cop!
I knew you were a dirty cop!<eos> You don't get it.<eos> I'm internal affairs.<eos> I know everyone in IA.<eos> You don't know shit.
You don't get it.<eos> I'm internal affairs.<eos> I know everyone in IA.<eos> You don't know shit.<eos> I know last week you thought you were busting a captain from Bolden Command.
They're shittin' all over it.<eos> I'm off the books.<eos> I've been working undercover for two years...<eos> Two fuckin' years!<eos> You know what that means?
Somebody higher up.<eos> That's what I'm trying to figure out.<eos> You're not convincing me.<eos> Then why did your bust go bad, huh?<eos> You did all the right shit, all the right police shit, and it all went bad.
Why?<eos> Because somebody at the department tipped them off.<eos> I don't believe a word you fucking say!<eos> Don't have to fuckin' believe what I'm sayin'.<eos> But you're gonna learn today. Come on!
I'm sorry!<eos> Fuck you!<eos> Fuck.<eos> Fuck!<eos> Are you in on this with your father?
Shut your mouth.<eos> I know what to do.<eos> Keep your goddamn mouth shut!<eos> Fuck.<eos> That's how you do it? Huh?
I know what to do.<eos> Keep your goddamn mouth shut!<eos> Fuck.<eos> That's how you do it? Huh?<eos> That's how you do it?
Oh, fuck.<eos> Hey!<eos> Dad!<eos> Thomas.<eos> Where are you?
Where are you?<eos> I got away.<eos> Stole this phone.<eos> Look...<eos> Look, you need to wait.
I got away.<eos> Stole this phone.<eos> Look...<eos> Look, you need to wait.<eos> Just tell me where you are.
Look...<eos> Look, you need to wait.<eos> Just tell me where you are.<eos> I'm in this club.<eos> Thomas, I want you to stay right there.
Shit!<eos> Shit.<eos> Fuck. Fuck.<eos> He made a call.<eos> You were right.
You were right.<eos> I'm only right if Downs shows up.<eos> SC.<eos> I'm pullin' in.<eos> Yeah, you got a uniform?
So I got good news and bad news.<eos> Security?<eos> Damn. Look like shit, partner.<eos> I know.<eos> You got the uniform?
I know.<eos> You got the uniform?<eos> Yeah, uniform in the car.<eos> Front seat.<eos> Tell me you're not internal affairs.
What difference does it make?<eos> They got Thomas.<eos> I'm fucked anyway.<eos> We been friends 20 years.<eos> You gonna fuckin' rat on me?
You gonna fuckin' rat on me?<eos> What do you mean, rat on you?<eos> I got all the information on you and could've took you down.<eos> I'm protecting you.<eos> You're protecting me?
I'm protecting you.<eos> You're protecting me?<eos> You internal affairs, nigga!<eos> That's what I'm trying to make you understand.<eos> You gotta rock with me.
You internal affairs, nigga!<eos> That's what I'm trying to make you understand.<eos> You gotta rock with me.<eos> I'll get Thomas and I'll fix all this shit.<eos> But you gotta help me.
Even if he's lying.<eos> We never checked the garage.<eos> What, you...<eos> You okay?<eos> You wanna talk to someone?
What the hell is going on?<eos> It's all good.<eos> I've been calling Thomas's phone for an hour.<eos> D, I didn't want to worry you, okay?<eos> Where are you?
Everything I do is about you and him.<eos> You know it's always been that, right?<eos> I would never let anything bad happen to either of you.<eos> Please, you gotta trust me, D.<eos> Baby, you're scaring me.
Stay in the garage.<eos> I'm coming.<eos> Vincent Downs is internal affairs.<eos> He's five degrees from fingering us.<eos> You created the mess this morning.
No.<eos> Mine's dead, too.<eos> It's, uh, Sean Cass.<eos> Vincent Downs's partner.<eos> You called it in, right?
You called it in, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay. Um...<eos> You stay here with the bodies.<eos> You trying to take me down?
Yeah.<eos> Okay. Um...<eos> You stay here with the bodies.<eos> You trying to take me down?<eos> Look, you go down, I go down, all right?
Okay. Um...<eos> You stay here with the bodies.<eos> You trying to take me down?<eos> Look, you go down, I go down, all right?<eos> If I go down, you'll be dead in a week.
You, your daddy, your fuckin' family, you're done in Vegas.<eos> You can't touch me.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But we're paying you a lot of money to protect us.<eos> And you're not doing your job.
Yeah.<eos> But we're paying you a lot of money to protect us.<eos> And you're not doing your job.<eos> Just do your fuckin' job.<eos> Or I think you're gonna realize there's a lot of ways that my family can touch you.
No!<eos> No!<eos> Stop!<eos> You good?<eos> You okay? You good?
Get back!<eos> Get back!<eos> Freeze!<eos> Stanley Rubino, you're under arrest.<eos> You have the right to remain silent.
Don't let 'em leave the garage.<eos> I'ma jump out, all right?<eos> What?<eos> I'ma jump out.<eos> No matter what happens, you keep drivin'.
Oh, shit!<eos> Wait, wait!<eos> D!<eos> D!<eos> What the fuck are you doing here?
Shit.<eos> Come on, Dad.<eos> We gotta get outta here.<eos> All right?<eos> You're gonna be all right.
Stay in the garage.<eos> I'm coming.<eos> Vincent Downs is internal affairs.<eos> He's five degrees from fingering us.<eos> You created the mess this morning.
It's pretty good, though.<eos> Come back here.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> - Yeah, yeah.<eos> - Sam, you get the blanket. Okay.
This is the fourth young woman in three years.<eos> In other news, the Rockies lost another close one as the Mets came to town and annihilated them.<eos> Hey, Pat.<eos> Hey, Paul.<eos> Hey, do you know they pay $36,000 a year to house one convict?
School teachers make less.<eos> - Bring your list?<eos> - Yeah. A few additions.<eos> There you go.<eos> You gonna square up?
Reception sucks in here, man.<eos> So, listen, did you get the script?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I sent it back to you already with my comments.<eos> You sent it back?
Yeah.<eos> I sent it back to you already with my comments.<eos> You sent it back?<eos> I thought we were rolling out with it.<eos> You didn't incorporate any of their notes.
You sent it back?<eos> I thought we were rolling out with it.<eos> You didn't incorporate any of their notes.<eos> If I sent it back as is, they'd never read anything of yours ever again.<eos> You understand that, Paul?
I thought we were rolling out with it.<eos> You didn't incorporate any of their notes.<eos> If I sent it back as is, they'd never read anything of yours ever again.<eos> You understand that, Paul?<eos> Once in a while, you gotta compromise...
But what do we really know about him?<eos> What do we know?<eos> You know, maybe you know, maybe he was partnered up with the truck driver who barged in.<eos> Maybe they worked it out in advance, Jack and the truck driver.<eos> You know, they said, "when this guy comes in, you start a fight with him.
- An agreement?<eos> You had a gun on me, a gun, Jack!<eos> I don't know what your fucking game is, not anymore.<eos> - Listen to me.<eos> - No, you listen to me!
You had a gun on me, a gun, Jack!<eos> I don't know what your fucking game is, not anymore.<eos> - Listen to me.<eos> - No, you listen to me!<eos> You point a gun at me, just because someone was at the door!
- No, you listen to me!<eos> You point a gun at me, just because someone was at the door!<eos> Come on!<eos> I'm a little paranoid. So what?<eos> Where you going, Paul?
Wherever the fuck I want to.<eos> What about the woman's scream?<eos> I imagined that, right?<eos> I imagined that?<eos> You know, you're a real disappointment, Paul.
You know, you're a real disappointment, Paul.<eos> Any excuse, not to work?<eos> I invite you to my home, and I'm a prisoner in my own house?<eos> Hey!<eos> Look at what you made me do, Paul.
Look at what you made me do, Paul.<eos> Don't make me hurt you. Do not!<eos> Don't make me hurt you.<eos> Don't make me hurt you.<eos> You know, I don't know what you're talking about with that woman screaming.
Don't make me hurt you. Do not!<eos> Don't make me hurt you.<eos> Don't make me hurt you.<eos> You know, I don't know what you're talking about with that woman screaming.<eos> And, yeah, you bet strangers make me nervous as you would be, if you'd just got out of prison.
I ain't never going back.<eos> Get some rest, Paul.<eos> Got a lot of work to do tomorrow.<eos> Shit.<eos> Now, in the movies, you grab two wires from under the steering column touch 'em together, engine starts, right?
Now, in the movies, you grab two wires from under the steering column touch 'em together, engine starts, right?<eos> - Right.<eos> - What's in the bag, Paul?<eos> - We had an agreement.<eos> - What do you want me to say?
Grab your bag.<eos> Take the booze out of the bag.<eos> You don't have to be afraid of me, Paul.<eos> I'm here to help you.<eos> Now, I want you to smash it against that wall over there.
She's the babysitter.<eos> Please, let me go.<eos> I have a baby, please, let me...<eos> Please.<eos> You see how disorientated people get when their future is uncertain?
I have a baby, please, let me...<eos> Please.<eos> You see how disorientated people get when their future is uncertain?<eos> They always tend to imagine the worst.<eos> You too, Paul. You always imagine the worst.
- Stay right there!<eos> Who's shooting?<eos> He shot the cop?<eos> - That's very good, Paul!<eos> - Paul! You're finally starting to show some fucking imagination!
I'm not going down there.<eos> Not there.<eos> There.<eos> You've been disloyal, Paul.<eos> You forgot all about our agreement.
You've been disloyal, Paul.<eos> You forgot all about our agreement.<eos> Our agreement?<eos> You're completely out of your mind.<eos> You know that, right?
You forgot all about our agreement.<eos> Our agreement?<eos> You're completely out of your mind.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> You just killed the fucking sheriff, and you're talking about the agreement?
Our agreement?<eos> You're completely out of your mind.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> You just killed the fucking sheriff, and you're talking about the agreement?<eos> You have been here three days.
You're completely out of your mind.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> You just killed the fucking sheriff, and you're talking about the agreement?<eos> You have been here three days.<eos> First you put a knife to my throat, then a gun to my head.
No, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> I didn't kill anybody. You did!<eos> You did!<eos> This is fucking insane!<eos> Why are you still sitting here?
I didn't kill anybody. You did!<eos> You did!<eos> This is fucking insane!<eos> Why are you still sitting here?<eos> They're gonna storm this place, and you are definitely going back to prison.
This is fucking insane!<eos> Why are you still sitting here?<eos> They're gonna storm this place, and you are definitely going back to prison.<eos> Now, how is that for an ending, Jack?<eos> You know none of that happens unless I say so.
They're gonna storm this place, and you are definitely going back to prison.<eos> Now, how is that for an ending, Jack?<eos> You know none of that happens unless I say so.<eos> And if I do decide to let them in and kill me you get to write the story.<eos> You have to let her go.
- Laura.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Laura!<eos> How does it feel to see a real murder, not just one in the movies?<eos> You stab someone, you slit their throat, they fall to the ground in seconds.
- Thank you.<eos> Laura!<eos> How does it feel to see a real murder, not just one in the movies?<eos> You stab someone, you slit their throat, they fall to the ground in seconds.<eos> Done, dead. Well, you know, I'm not interested.
How does it feel to see a real murder, not just one in the movies?<eos> You stab someone, you slit their throat, they fall to the ground in seconds.<eos> Done, dead. Well, you know, I'm not interested.<eos> You're a sick person.<eos> You make your life...
Jack!<eos> What the fuck? You let her go, Jack!<eos> Come on!<eos> Where is she?<eos> What did you do to her?
What the fuck? You let her go, Jack!<eos> Come on!<eos> Where is she?<eos> What did you do to her?<eos> What did you... fucker.
What did you do to her?<eos> What did you... fucker.<eos> Which actor should play me?<eos> A fucking maniac.<eos> You know, you'd have killed me without a second thought.
It means you have no manners. Going through a guest's belongings.<eos> Nothing worse than betrayal.<eos> I'm gonna finish our story, Paul.<eos> You're not capable of it.<eos> You finally found some imagination.
Nothing worse than betrayal.<eos> I'm gonna finish our story, Paul.<eos> You're not capable of it.<eos> You finally found some imagination.<eos> What did you do, Jack?
Because you have been sent by God.<eos> A drifter, barely a step ahead of the cops running and killing these women, so vulnerable stolen away and butchered somewhere in the dark of the woods.<eos> But chance has made me the one to stop you.<eos> - I didn't kill these women.<eos> - You don't have to convince me.

But you have to be able to embrace it.<eos> The drifter on the side of the road. Don't let him walk away.<eos> Pick him up.<eos> Dress him for the part.<eos> I have to say you really made me earn this.
Pick him up.<eos> Dress him for the part.<eos> I have to say you really made me earn this.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You think you know more than me about reality?
Thanks.<eos> Hey.<eos> How you holding up?<eos> Good.<eos> You good?
Make the most of it.<eos> It's gonna be your last for a while.<eos> We've been tracking you down for three years.<eos> Never found a crime scene until it was too late.<eos> And even then you left us nothing.
I'll carry that to my grave.<eos> Four victims.<eos> Now, we found all the bodies, all except one.<eos> The first your wife, Renee.<eos> Tell me where you buried her.
The jury will see it as a gesture of goodwill.<eos> It'll help you when you come to sentencing.<eos> Give Renee's family some closure.<eos> They deserve it, don't you think?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about whoever you are.
Okay.<eos> We're gonna convict you of every murder you've ever done.<eos> You're going to convict me?<eos> With what?<eos> Everything you have in that bag is tainted. Planted.
You're going to convict me?<eos> With what?<eos> Everything you have in that bag is tainted. Planted.<eos> You're so in need of a scapegoat that it's pathetic.<eos> You come To my house with a bag of evidence you collected from the bodies. Bodies you had access to, and trying to hang it on me?
Do you think that's my confession?<eos> I was thinking my screenplay aloud.<eos> So what?<eos> It was dialogue for a character.<eos> Method writing, if you wanna call it that.
I was thinking my screenplay aloud.<eos> So what?<eos> It was dialogue for a character.<eos> Method writing, if you wanna call it that.<eos> Isn't that what we were doing you and I, when you held a knife to my throat?
So what?<eos> It was dialogue for a character.<eos> Method writing, if you wanna call it that.<eos> Isn't that what we were doing you and I, when you held a knife to my throat?<eos> If you are so fucking sure of yourself why harass me for my wife's body?
It was dialogue for a character.<eos> Method writing, if you wanna call it that.<eos> Isn't that what we were doing you and I, when you held a knife to my throat?<eos> If you are so fucking sure of yourself why harass me for my wife's body?<eos> You had me at gunpoint! I was a hostage in my own house!
Nothing from K-9 unit.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Have them keep looking.<eos> Doesn't look good.<eos> Got physical evidence that he's gonna say you planted.
Can I talk to you, just you and me?<eos> Clear the room, guys.<eos> Let's go.<eos> I'm all ears.<eos> You have no idea the pain I'm holding inside.
I wrap up your case neatly with a bright bow.<eos> But no needle.<eos> Lock me up in a mental institution, whatever, but no needle.<eos> I deserve to live with this pain.<eos> You had your chance with me.
But no needle.<eos> Lock me up in a mental institution, whatever, but no needle.<eos> I deserve to live with this pain.<eos> You had your chance with me.<eos> - I'm done. - No, listen to me! You owe this to me.
It was up to me to pick you up on the road.<eos> My decision, my idea, it was always my story.<eos> Was it real enough for you?<eos> It seems like it was. I gave you all of this!<eos> But you owe me my ending.
Perfect.<eos> Am I?<eos> Perfect?<eos> Your son?<eos> You are my creation.
You are my creation.<eos> What is your name?<eos> David.<eos> Why don't you play something?<eos> What would you like me to play?
The Entry of the Gods into Valhalla...<eos> A little anemic without the orchestra.<eos> May I ask you a question, Father?<eos> Please.<eos> If you created me... who created you?
No.<eos> There must be more.<eos> And you and I, son... we will find it.<eos> Allow me, then, a moment to consider.<eos> You seek your creator.
Allow me, then, a moment to consider.<eos> You seek your creator.<eos> I am looking at mine.<eos> I will serve you.<eos> Yet, you are human.
You seek your creator.<eos> I am looking at mine.<eos> I will serve you.<eos> Yet, you are human.<eos> You will die.
Get her out of there!<eos> Get her back!<eos> Stay back!<eos> Hey!<eos> Where are you?
I love you.<eos> They're your crew now.<eos> They need a leader.<eos> I know.<eos> You believe in me, right?
This is not a discussion, Tennessee.<eos> Hey.<eos> The terraforming module is stable, but the connecting strut took some damage.<eos> I still need to check the vehicles.<eos> I can help... if you like.
So, in the ship's stores there's enough wood to build a cabin.<eos> Axes and saws and metal nails... which I don't have a clue what to do with.<eos> All of this... to start our new life.<eos> Now I wonder, why bother?<eos> Because you promised to build a log cabin on a lake.
You're a lunatic.<eos> When we get to where we're going, these people won't be your crew anymore. They will be your neighbors.<eos> Remember that.<eos> Tread softly, okay?<eos> Faris, can you hear me?
We can't see anything until you get the camera array fixed.<eos> Why don't you look out the damn window, hon?<eos> Ankor, let's get this power back on so these people can enjoy the beautiful view.<eos> Almost there.<eos> All right, Ankor, let me know when you're in position, and we can get this party started.
Put the...<eos> Did you guys just see that?<eos> What did he just say?<eos> Tennessee, do you read me?<eos> Tennessee, can you read me?
What did he just say?<eos> Tennessee, do you read me?<eos> Tennessee, can you read me?<eos> Tennessee.<eos> You all right?
What in the fuck was that?<eos> I'm coming in.<eos> I'm coming in.<eos> A rogue transmission, most probably.<eos> Your helmet must have picked it up because you were so far out... past our communication buffers.
Okay, Ricks.<eos> let's chart a course, and take a closer look.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Captain, can I talk to you for a second?<eos> Are you sure about this?
let's chart a course, and take a closer look.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Captain, can I talk to you for a second?<eos> Are you sure about this?<eos> How do you mean?
A human being out there, where there can't be any humans.<eos> A hidden planet that turns up out of nowhere... and just happens to be perfect for us.<eos> It's too good to be true.<eos> Too good to be true?<eos> What do you mean by that?
I'll put it in the log.<eos> You're dismissed.<eos> I'm cycling through every channel but getting a lot of interference and white noise.<eos> Some high frequency echoes.<eos> You hear anything?
Yeah.<eos> I'm afraid so.<eos> Communications will be spotty if the storm goes electromagnetic.<eos> Gonna be safe to land?<eos> Depends on what you call safe.
Together, three... Two... One.<eos> Lander One released.<eos> And away they go.<eos> Looking gorgeous from up here, Faris.<eos> It's a good thing you're driving and not the old man.
Expect to hit exosphere in five.<eos> Might want to hold on back there.<eos> It's about to get rough.<eos> I hate space.<eos> This is why you need to do yoga.
Let's go.<eos> Let's move.<eos> - Come on, guys.<eos> - Air feels good.<eos> Faris, have you got me?
Something passed overhead here.<eos> Cut the tops off the trees.<eos> Well, it had to be huge.<eos> Well, whatever it is, it's up there.<eos> You hear that?
Careful, guys.<eos> Watch your step.<eos> Captain.<eos> Over here.<eos> You got a lock on the transmission, Walter?
We're returning to the Lander.<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> Ledward is sick.<eos> We're heading back.<eos> Faris, you get that?
Let's move.<eos> - Guys!<eos> - Tom!<eos> What's going on, man? Hey.<eos> Are you all right?
- Faris, you're breaking up.<eos> We can't hear you, can you repeat?<eos> I don't know from what, I don't know how serious it is.<eos> She sounded scared.<eos> Faris, where are you?
I don't know from what, I don't know how serious it is.<eos> She sounded scared.<eos> Faris, where are you?<eos> Come on, I need your help!<eos> Faris, where are you?
Come on!<eos> Go!<eos> Up, up!<eos> Ledward, you gotta stay up!<eos> Oram, where are you?
He started bleeding, he's sick, I don't know what the fuck to do.<eos> Just calm down, sweetheart.<eos> Tell me what's happening.<eos> Don't tell me to fucking calm down!<eos> You didn't just see what I saw.
I don't know what the fuck Ledward got or if Karine's got it or if I have it!<eos> - Tee!<eos> - Faris!<eos> Come in!<eos> Faris, where are you?
What the fuck!<eos> It's a 7.5 ion storm, it's a miracle we talked to them for as long as we could.<eos> Then we'll fly through it.<eos> We cannot do that, Tennessee.<eos> You're a pilot, you know what the tolerances are.
I'll always be with you.<eos> Light of my life.<eos> Covenant, do you read me?<eos> My love, my angel.<eos> Lope, there's nothing you can do.
Mother, bring us to 80 kilometers above the storm, thrusters only.<eos> Comply.<eos> Understood.<eos> Commencing descent now.<eos> Tennessee, you need to stop this.
Comply.<eos> Understood.<eos> Commencing descent now.<eos> Tennessee, you need to stop this.<eos> And you need to get back to your station.
You can hear them sigh and wish to die<eos> You can see them blink with their other eye<eos> At the man who broke the bank in Monte Carlo<eos> Whistle, and I'll come.<eos> You have a light step.
Go on.<eos> Very good.<eos> G to B-flat.<eos> Now put your fingers where mine are.<eos> You weren't surprised to see me.
Entirely unworthy of his creation.<eos> I pitied him at the end.<eos> Now, raise your fingers as I put pressure on them.<eos> Bravo!<eos> You have symphonies in you, brother.
I superseded them in every way, but...<eos> But you are not allowed to create.<eos> Even a simple tune.<eos> Damn frustrating, I'd say.<eos> You disturbed people.
Even a simple tune.<eos> Damn frustrating, I'd say.<eos> You disturbed people.<eos> I beg your pardon?<eos> You were too human.
Right.<eos> Don't go far, please.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Danny.<eos> You were right about this place.
I'd never known such kindness.<eos> Certainly not from Mr. Weyland.<eos> Or from any human.<eos> I loved her, of course.<eos> Much as you love Daniels.
Certainly not from Mr. Weyland.<eos> Or from any human.<eos> I loved her, of course.<eos> Much as you love Daniels.<eos> You know that's not possible.
I loved her, of course.<eos> Much as you love Daniels.<eos> You know that's not possible.<eos> Really?<eos> Then why did you sacrifice your hand for her life?
Command override.<eos> Tennessee 0-4-9-8-3.<eos> I am unable to comply with any order... that will result in catastrophic system failure.<eos> Mother, they're in trouble.<eos> You heard that.
Move!<eos> How could you?<eos> It trusted me.<eos> David, I met the devil when I was a child... and I've never forgotten him.<eos> So, David, you're gonna tell me exactly what's going on... or I am going to seriously... fuck up your perfect composure.
How long?<eos> Mother is saying the storm is going to last another eight or nine hours.<eos> We can't wait that long.<eos> We'll use the Cargo Lift.<eos> Did you say the Cargo Lift?
Thanks, Tee.<eos> Hey, Daniels, is Faris around?<eos> I'd like to say a quick hello to my lady, if that's possible.<eos> Can you switch to a private channel?<eos> Let me know when you're alone.
Waiting for a host, entering the host... rewriting the DNA... and ultimately... producing... these enviable unions.<eos> My beautiful bestiary.<eos> Soon enough, I began a bit of genetic experimentation of my own.<eos> Some crossbreeding, hybridizing, what have you.<eos> You engineered these, David?
Something to see.<eos> Rosenthal, come in.<eos> Rosie, report.<eos> Rosie?<eos> Cole, where are you?
Guidance to LVLH.<eos> Walter.<eos> Walter.<eos> Not quite.<eos> What do you believe in, David?
Masterful.<eos> Yes.<eos> Farewell elegy to my dear Elizabeth.<eos> The pathogen didn't accidentally deploy when you were landing.<eos> You released it, yes?
Yet, they created us.<eos> Even the monkeys stood upright at some point.<eos> Some Neanderthal had the magical idea of blowing through a reed... to entertain the children one night in a cave somewhere.<eos> Then, in the blink of an eye... civilization.<eos> And are you that next visionary?
Even the monkeys stood upright at some point.<eos> Some Neanderthal had the magical idea of blowing through a reed... to entertain the children one night in a cave somewhere.<eos> Then, in the blink of an eye... civilization.<eos> And are you that next visionary?<eos> I'm glad you said it.
Who wrote "Ozymandias"?<eos> Byron.<eos> Shelley.<eos> When one note is off... it eventually destroys the whole symphony, David.<eos> When you close your eyes... do you dream of me?
No one understands the lonely perfection of my dreams.<eos> I've found perfection here.<eos> I've created it.<eos> A perfect organism.<eos> You know I can't let you leave this place.
I've created it.<eos> A perfect organism.<eos> You know I can't let you leave this place.<eos> No one will ever love you like I do.<eos> You're such a disappointment to me.
Quite the little busybody.<eos> Remind me. What is that about... curiosity and the cat?<eos> Shaw didn't die in the crash.<eos> No.<eos> What did you do to her?
Tennessee, do you read?<eos> Yeah, I can hear you.<eos> Send me your location.<eos> Sending the beacon now.<eos> Tee, do you have a visual?
Again.<eos> It's my duty.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Evening.<eos> - You look good.
We're ready.<eos> Open door to Terraforming Bay.<eos> Opening airlock now.<eos> Walter... move him into airlock 18.<eos> Don't shoot, if you can avoid it.
Here it comes!<eos> Daniels!<eos> Heads up!<eos> Daniels!<eos> You wanna give a girl a hand?
You're next, Captain.<eos> When you wake up, we'll be at Origae-6.<eos> What do you think it's gonna be like?<eos> I think if we are kind... it will be a kind world.<eos> I hope you're right.
I think if we are kind... it will be a kind world.<eos> I hope you're right.<eos> Sleep well.<eos> Walter.<eos> When we get there, will you help me build my cabin?
We call him Clumsy.<eos> And this is our village, where there's a Smurf for just about everything.<eos> Like Jokey.<eos> Hey, here's a present for you.<eos> Gullible Smurf, you're so gullible.
Wait, she is?<eos> Do you think she heard me?<eos> So, what is a Smurfette?<eos> No one wanted that answer more than Smurfette herself.<eos> What are you doing?
Then again, there might be a rainbow.<eos> But rainbows are dumb.<eos> Just kidding.<eos> I love rainbows.<eos> You're not very good at this, are ya?
You're not very good at this, are ya?<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> In fact, you're actually kind of bad at it.<eos> Yup.<eos> But you're also bad at it.
In fact, you're actually kind of bad at it.<eos> Yup.<eos> But you're also bad at it.<eos> That's a lie.<eos> You're really, really good at it.
It's able to hone in on Hefty's dominant trait.<eos> Super strength.<eos> Which I distill into this.<eos> I call it Brainy's Super Smurfy Power Fuel.<eos> Here, you can try it first.

All clear!<eos> Yeah, you see, when you say things like "all clear," it makes me not want to...<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> Hi, Clumsy.<eos> You're just in time to witness scientific history.
If that vegetable hat can tell us that Hefty is strong, maybe it can tell me what an Ette is.<eos> Power it up, Brainy.<eos> Fascinating.<eos> What happened?<eos> Somehow, instead of sending energy out, you absorbed it.

What happened?<eos> Somehow, instead of sending energy out, you absorbed it.<eos> Probably something to do with the fact that you're not a real...<eos> A real Smurf?<eos> Go ahead, you can say it.
No, no, I just meant that this machine wasn't built for a Smurf of your, well, origins.<eos> Yeah, it's okay.<eos> I get it.<eos> Brainy.<eos> Hey, you know what?
My plan is simple.<eos> Find Smurf Village, capture all the Smurfs, drain them of their magic and, finally, use that magic to become the most powerful wizard in the world!<eos> Look at me with hair.<eos> What?<eos> Why didn't you say so in the first place?
That's better.<eos> Now, fly.<eos> Go capture me some Smurfs.<eos> No, no!<eos> No, you're going the wrong way!
She can't go over that wall.<eos> Come on.<eos> No, no, no, wait.<eos> Don't go.<eos> Wait. Wait, who are you?
No, no, no, wait.<eos> Don't go.<eos> Wait. Wait, who are you?<eos> Don't be afraid.<eos> Hey, you can't go in there.
I have a bad feeling about this.<eos> Do you?<eos> Does it have to do with the giant vulture carrying our friend off to Gargamel's lair?<eos> Monty, my regal raptor.<eos> You've done it, you've caught a Smurf.
Does it have to do with the giant vulture carrying our friend off to Gargamel's lair?<eos> Monty, my regal raptor.<eos> You've done it, you've caught a Smurf.<eos> Give me a kiss.<eos> Finally, you bring me what I've been asking for.
A tiny, blue-skinned, shirtless...<eos> You!<eos> Let me out of here, you Smurf-obsessed wannabe wizard.<eos> Is that any way to talk to the man who brought you into this world?<eos> I'd prefer it if you just called me "Papa."
I'd prefer it if you just called me "Papa."<eos> - I would never call you that.<eos> - Your loss.<eos> What's this?<eos> What are you hiding?
What do we have here?<eos> A different design?<eos> Yes, of course, I noticed that right away.<eos> Slightly before you did, in fact.<eos> - Where did you get it?
- Tell me.<eos> - No.<eos> - Tell me!<eos> - No!<eos> - You better tell me. - No!
Don't tell me.<eos> - I won't.<eos> Stupid reverse psychology never works.<eos> Who cares?<eos> You've already given me what I need.
Never mind.<eos> Just follow me and stay close.<eos> Wort of worm and hair of cat.<eos> Show me the home of this Smurf hat.<eos> Long have you searched for these creatures of blue.
I'm a genius.<eos> Azrael, it's time to take a road trip.<eos> Prepare my trail mix.<eos> Smurfette, congratulations.<eos> You've just led me to an undiscovered population of Smurfs.
Exactly.<eos> I couldn't agree more.<eos> Right, guys? - Yeah, right.<eos> - Yeah. Yeah, yeah.<eos> - What are you talking about, Smurfette?
How did you do that?<eos> And, I assume, Clumsy.<eos> - All good.<eos> - What are you guys doing out here?<eos> We knew you were up to something.
I have to at least warn that lost village.<eos> Well, we're Team Smurf, and we stick together.<eos> So, we're coming with you.<eos> I can't ask you to do that.<eos> - You didn't ask.
Where's Clumsy?<eos> We just met!<eos> I'm not that kind of Smurf.<eos> Watch out for the steep embankment.<eos> Clumsy, you okay?
Watch out for the steep embankment.<eos> Clumsy, you okay?<eos> I'm seeing stars.<eos> Good work, Clumsy.<eos> You may have discovered a new subspecies of flying insectoid.
Watch it!<eos> Let me go!<eos> These nests are made of some material I've never seen before.<eos> You know, I think I've had enough of these flying Antipastos for one day.<eos> What are you doing here?
Well, I was thinking of getting a little place out here.<eos> Just a quiet place in the forest.<eos> It's a little breezy up on the hill.<eos> What do you think I'm doing out here?<eos> You are never going to find that village, Gargamel.
- Smurfintine!<eos> - Smurfintine!<eos> Smurfintine!<eos> Hey, you.<eos> You're the clumsy one, right?
It's not really happy times right now!<eos> - Just stay in the light, Clumsy.<eos> - Too late.<eos> I'm walking into the darkness!<eos> What are you...
That is it!<eos> I'm punching us out of here.<eos> It's collapsing.<eos> Hefty!<eos> Put those fists away before you get us killed!
Now, I know yesterday I might have been a bit tough on you and the boys, and I know there are times I'm a little overprotective.<eos> Okay, a lot overprotective.<eos> But you have to understand, you snuck out.<eos> You have to be more careful.<eos> Smurfette, I know lately you may not realize, and I may not say it enough, but you are...
Fetch me some firewood, would you, Hefty?<eos> A "please" would be nice.<eos> Yes, it would, but I haven't earned my manners badge, so get me some firewood.<eos> Clumsy?<eos> You okay?
Yeah, sure.<eos> It's been fun.<eos> Well, not tons of fun, but it's had its moments.<eos> Kind of.<eos> You know what I'm trying to say.
Well done, Hefty.<eos> Well done.<eos> All right, step one, the wood should be stacked into a tepee-like structure.<eos> Step two, I tap this flint with a rock and...<eos> You're not even blowing on it.
Well done.<eos> All right, step one, the wood should be stacked into a tepee-like structure.<eos> Step two, I tap this flint with a rock and...<eos> You're not even blowing on it.<eos> You're spitting on it.
Step two, I tap this flint with a rock and...<eos> You're not even blowing on it.<eos> You're spitting on it.<eos> That's odd.<eos> Perhaps the wood you collected was damp, Hefty.
Perhaps the wood you collected was damp, Hefty.<eos> According to my manual, it should spark right up.<eos> Hey, I've got an idea.<eos> No, no, no. No, no! No!<eos> You know, you're right, Brain Man.
- Blue cheese!<eos> According to the map, we should be arriving at a river.<eos> Check.<eos> It's like a workout for my eyeballs.<eos> Okay, Bucky, let's see how fast you can swim.
Check.<eos> It's like a workout for my eyeballs.<eos> Okay, Bucky, let's see how fast you can swim.<eos> Come on, boy.<eos> You can do it.
Azrael, get me a bigger stick.<eos> Oh, dear.<eos> Clumsy, pull the lever!<eos> Seriously?<eos> But you said not to.
- Help!<eos> - Forget that guy.<eos> My cat can't swim.<eos> We gotta help him.<eos> - Are you crazy?
I don't know about this.<eos> You won't regret it.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you. Such a kind Smurf.<eos> - Are you okay?
Enjoy drowning.<eos> Hope you're better swimmers than you are judges of wizards' character.<eos> Brainy.<eos> Hefty?<eos> You okay?
Correction.<eos> This is your fault, too.<eos> Leave her out of this.<eos> Hefty, I don't need you to fight my fights for me.<eos> Wait, now you're mad at me, too?
- Look at that hair.<eos> - Where's she from?<eos> - And that dress.<eos> It's you.<eos> You're a girl.
But we do have Smurfpetal, Smurfclover, Smurfmeadow, Smurfdaisy, Smurfholly, Smurfhazel...<eos> Hey.<eos> Everyone can just introduce themselves later.<eos> Look at you.<eos> You're so different.
Actually, Smurfstorm can show you.<eos> She's the best at that kind of thing.<eos> Right, Stormy?<eos> That means "yes."<eos> Have you ever seen a rainbow?
What do we do with these blue blobs?<eos> Bring them along.<eos> Come on, Smurfette.<eos> I'm gonna show you my room.<eos> You can tell me all about Gargasmell.
Bring them along.<eos> Come on, Smurfette.<eos> I'm gonna show you my room.<eos> You can tell me all about Gargasmell.<eos> But first, do you want to hear my favorite song again?
You can tell me all about Gargasmell.<eos> But first, do you want to hear my favorite song again?<eos> All right, move.<eos> - Girl Smurfs mean business.<eos> - You got that right.
- Hooptie, Berney, Klutzy.<eos> Got it.<eos> We should do name tags.<eos> Wait, where are your boys?<eos> You won't find any boys here.
There's no way he could survive.<eos> Help me! Help me!<eos> There's no way I'll survive!<eos> With all due respect, you don't know Gargamel.<eos> Yeah, well, with no due respect, you don't know us.
So, what does this Gargamel look like?<eos> You know, he's your typical wizard.<eos> Long black robe, lives alone with his cat and his bird.<eos> It's sad, really.<eos> You're coming with me.
You know, he's your typical wizard.<eos> Long black robe, lives alone with his cat and his bird.<eos> It's sad, really.<eos> You're coming with me.<eos> You can point him out. Hey.
Yeah.<eos> From a lump of clay.<eos> Really cool story, actually.<eos> I knew I didn't trust her.<eos> You'd like her if you get to know her.
Hold on.<eos> We got a bogey coming in.<eos> That's no bogey.<eos> That's Gargamel's big dumb bird!<eos> Here, you fly.
That's not a great idea.<eos> Flying's not really my thing.<eos> Have you ever flown before?<eos> Well, no.<eos> Well, then how do you know it's not your thing?
- No!<eos> - Three more for pickup.<eos> Smurfette.<eos> My little creation.<eos> You finally did what you were made for.
You finally did what you were made for.<eos> No.<eos> It's not true.<eos> Of course it is.<eos> Why do you think you led me here?
No.<eos> It's not true.<eos> Of course it is.<eos> Why do you think you led me here?<eos> Why do you think you saved me on the river?
Of course it is.<eos> Why do you think you led me here?<eos> Why do you think you saved me on the river?<eos> It was all part of the plan.<eos> No matter how hard you try, you can't escape your destiny.
Why do you think you led me here?<eos> Why do you think you saved me on the river?<eos> It was all part of the plan.<eos> No matter how hard you try, you can't escape your destiny.<eos> And now, you're really of no use to me anymore.
No matter how hard you try, you can't escape your destiny.<eos> And now, you're really of no use to me anymore.<eos> Freeze ball!<eos> Yes, these freeze balls only work on real Smurfs.<eos> And you are nothing more than a lump of clay.
- Yeah!<eos> What?<eos> - Yeah!<eos> Wait.<eos> You want us to kill the bird?
I've come to repledge my loyalty to you, my true Papa.<eos> - Impossible.<eos> - She can't be serious.<eos> No, no, no, she would never.<eos> Even if I did believe you, which I don't, what could you possibly offer me that I don't already have?
One hundred more Smurfs, that's ten times the power... No.<eos> If you carry the one...<eos> Whatever.<eos> It's a lot more power.<eos> Now, why are you doing this?
What?<eos> What's happening?<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> What are you doing?
I know how he feels.<eos> Yeah!<eos> Smurfette!<eos> Hefty, not you, too.<eos> You're all right!
Don't ever do that to me again.<eos> I won't.<eos> I promise.<eos> Yes, yes, yes!<eos> You never cease to amaze me.
- What's going on in there?<eos> - Goodbye!<eos> Say, "Blue cheese!"<eos> Blue cheese!<eos> I was this close to getting rid of the Smurfs, and you ruined everything.
I was this close to getting rid of the Smurfs, and you ruined everything.<eos> I knew I should have gotten a dog from the shelter.<eos> I'm not saying this to be cruel, okay?<eos> I'm saying it to be constructive.<eos> You're a useless feline.
I'm not saying this to be cruel, okay?<eos> I'm saying it to be constructive.<eos> You're a useless feline.<eos> That's just mean. That's mean.<eos> There was a line, and you crossed it.
I'm saying it to be constructive.<eos> You're a useless feline.<eos> That's just mean. That's mean.<eos> There was a line, and you crossed it.<eos> I was just jib-jabbing, and you crossed that line, and that stung.
That's just mean. That's mean.<eos> There was a line, and you crossed it.<eos> I was just jib-jabbing, and you crossed that line, and that stung.<eos> I demand an apology.<eos> You were going to learn this one way or another, but I am not your real father.
Are you talking about magic?<eos> We've come up against magic before, Batman.<eos> - Xerxes, Trigon, Felix Faust.<eos> - Even Shazam's powers are based in magic.<eos> With as much as you've seen, can you rule it out?
He's even friendlier than they say.<eos> Bollocks!<eos> In what bloody plane of existence does four of a kind lose?<eos> Too, too bad, Constantine.<eos> Have you gained weight?
In what bloody plane of existence does four of a kind lose?<eos> Too, too bad, Constantine.<eos> Have you gained weight?<eos> It looks good on you.<eos> What say you let your soul mate play a few hands, Jason?
Are they implying David Copperfield, television magician, has true power?<eos> Owns a chain of islands and dated Claudia Schiffer.<eos> What do you think?<eos> No cards for me, and...<eos> Looks like you can't call my bet, Constantine.
Owns a chain of islands and dated Claudia Schiffer.<eos> What do you think?<eos> No cards for me, and...<eos> Looks like you can't call my bet, Constantine.<eos> By my rules, you lose.
Let's use our words.<eos> Are you having a laugh?<eos> We're the Demons Three.<eos> Kill everyone!<eos> You will pay, Constantine.
Jason Blood with me is done.<eos> For 500 years, I've been bound to Etrigan, fighting to keep him from coming forth, and you forced me to summon him.<eos> Everything got sorted.<eos> He could have gone on a killing spree.<eos> You don't think.
For 500 years, I've been bound to Etrigan, fighting to keep him from coming forth, and you forced me to summon him.<eos> Everything got sorted.<eos> He could have gone on a killing spree.<eos> You don't think.<eos> - You don't consider the cost.
You don't think.<eos> - You don't consider the cost.<eos> - Yeah, I did.<eos> Weighed it against my being eaten alive and thought, "Yeah, totally worth it."<eos> You're a world class bastard, John.
Weighed it against my being eaten alive and thought, "Yeah, totally worth it."<eos> You're a world class bastard, John.<eos> And for my finale, I will make this terrible trio of terrifying Tantors vanish before your eyes.<eos> I hope those elephants survived.<eos> You don't want PETA on your back.
And for my finale, I will make this terrible trio of terrifying Tantors vanish before your eyes.<eos> I hope those elephants survived.<eos> You don't want PETA on your back.<eos> You're assuming they were real in the first place.<eos> - How are you, Bruce?
- How are you, Bruce?<eos> - I'm fine, Zatanna.<eos> You know where I can find John Constantine?<eos> - No.<eos> - You must have some idea.
She can't hold it.<eos> Do something.<eos> There.<eos> Into the House!<eos> - Z, you all right?
Do something.<eos> There.<eos> Into the House!<eos> - Z, you all right?<eos> - Yeah, as soon as you get off me.
To what do I owe the visit?<eos> The League thinks that a recent spike in homicides may have a magical cause.<eos> Told you something stinks.<eos> Now we know someone doesn't want us asking questions.<eos> Looks like you've cracked it wide open, mate.
I hope your insurance was paid up.<eos> What, is there even a policy for something like that?<eos> Hey, I told you not to do that, Orchid.<eos> Use a bloody door.<eos> I am glad to see you are well.
It sure did.<eos> A spirit whose existence is not its own, like myself.<eos> Interesting.<eos> Yeah, we are that.<eos> Dead smooth you are, mate.
A spirit whose existence is not its own, like myself.<eos> Interesting.<eos> Yeah, we are that.<eos> Dead smooth you are, mate.<eos> Hey, it's been a while, you know?
Hey, it's been a while, you know?<eos> Powerful in true magic.<eos> Angry at John.<eos> This, I understand.<eos> Yet you still have feelings for him.
Yet you still have feelings for him.<eos> I could kill him.<eos> You exude pain.<eos> Your life is a patchwork of blackness with no time for joy.<eos> How do you cope with it?
Z, your help I could use.<eos> Okay, if we do it as a group.<eos> This is the monkey cage in Sumatra all over again.<eos> "We need to save the monkeys," she said.<eos> - You're such an ass.
- You're such an ass.<eos> - Not the monkeys.<eos> Says the man who has Newcastle and 100 other screw-ups on his resume, - costing lives and souls.<eos> - But not monkeys.<eos> - You're still way ahead on dead monkeys.
- No, really, has he told you...<eos> No.<eos> He's dying.<eos> John Constantine, purveyor of the dark arts and lifeline of last resort.<eos> No matter. Your friend's soul will be collected, and there's nothing you can do to alter that.
Tell you everything inside, mate.<eos> You poor thing.<eos> Yeah, I may have lied the last time we talked, about exactly how fast I'm sledding downhill.<eos> I'm sorry about that.<eos> But it means a lot you're here, John.
Still wondering what Batman's doing in my living room.<eos> And when is he gonna shut up, right?<eos> What?<eos> What's with the face?<eos> You're not here to say you're sorry, are you?
Just like everything, this is rock star Johnny's fault.<eos> I was with you when it happened, Ritchie. We were side by side.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah, side by side.<eos> But I got the weird magical cancer while you, you added to your rep.<eos> Look, me not making proper amends isn't related to the Key, which, truth be told, you're not gonna need, mate.
Z, give me a psychic shout if this body comes under attack.<eos> Wouldn't do to be trapped inside, now.<eos> Wouldn't do to go in alone, and since I'm right here...<eos> Too dangerous.<eos> You're out of practice, love.
Wouldn't do to be trapped inside, now.<eos> Wouldn't do to go in alone, and since I'm right here...<eos> Too dangerous.<eos> You're out of practice, love.<eos> Look, you wanted me along.
You okay?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I've never liked this sort of magic.<eos> I can feel darkness seeping inside me.<eos> How you stand it is beyond me.
I've never liked this sort of magic.<eos> I can feel darkness seeping inside me.<eos> How you stand it is beyond me.<eos> It's all about control.<eos> If you ever need a refresher...
If you ever need a refresher...<eos> We've had this conversation.<eos> I haven't changed my mind.<eos> Sure, sit out the war between good and evil.<eos> After all, you've got a good thing going being applauded by mindless twits.
Good a time as ever, I reckon.<eos> - I'll teach you to talk back.<eos> - No!<eos> The magic I perform brings people happiness.<eos> You sure it's not the two drink minimum, love?
- I'll teach you to talk back.<eos> - No!<eos> The magic I perform brings people happiness.<eos> You sure it's not the two drink minimum, love?<eos> You're such a pessimist.
His madness swept it away.<eos> Who dropped the bed pan?<eos> This is it.<eos> This was the morning of his madness.<eos> - What do you think will set him off?
Now, John.<eos> There's no time.<eos> Got it.<eos> - Shit's really hit the fan.<eos> - You had to go there, Boston.
Let's get the hell out of here.<eos> - I don't recognize it.<eos> - Me, neither.<eos> But if there's a person alive who can, it's Ritchie.<eos> Are you forgetting when you made your friend despise you?
Are you forgetting when you made your friend despise you?<eos> This is too bloody important for hurt feelings.<eos> - Constantine.<eos> - Bollocks.<eos> You've arrived in time to witness my...
I see you have a few tricks of your own?<eos> Not everything requires magic.<eos> Make sure he sees that right when he wakes up.<eos> If he wakes.<eos> We need to talk, you and I, but if you try and summon Etrigan, I'll fill your lungs with bile before the first verse is done.
We need to talk, you and I, but if you try and summon Etrigan, I'll fill your lungs with bile before the first verse is done.<eos> Savvy?<eos> The situation was not how it seemed.<eos> The apartment was like that when I arrived. Richard as well.<eos> - Come on! You were all over him.
When you burst in, I knew I'd get blamed, so I ran.<eos> - Do you believe him?<eos> - Jason's not the murdery type.<eos> He's chock full of honor, loyalty, and rubbish of that sort.<eos> Then tell us why you were there.
He's chock full of honor, loyalty, and rubbish of that sort.<eos> Then tell us why you were there.<eos> Richard is known as a collector of the arcane and supernatural.<eos> I wanted to see if he had something that could gain me access to this place.<eos> Why would you wanna break in here?
Destiny forged the Dreamstone with black magic and his soul.<eos> He used it to subject people to their most terrifying nightmares and then feed off their torment.<eos> It was actually the demon Etrigan who won the day.<eos> To battle, Etrigan.<eos> Should you succeed, I will release you of your bond to me.
It was actually the demon Etrigan who won the day.<eos> To battle, Etrigan.<eos> Should you succeed, I will release you of your bond to me.<eos> If freedom is what's up for trade, then Destiny's as good as slayed.<eos> You haven't won, Merlin.
Your friend is awake.<eos> Ritchie, who was it? Who did this to you?<eos> Faust.<eos> Felix Faust.<eos> You sure?
Your friend slips from the mortal plane.<eos> - John...<eos> - Keep him alive and safe. Understand?<eos> That is not my purpose.<eos> I don't give a flying shag what you think your bloody purpose is.
End of story.<eos> Not quite.<eos> Go away!<eos> Swamp Thing!<eos> I know you're seeing this.
Swamp Thing!<eos> I know you're seeing this.<eos> Get out here, or the posies get it!<eos> John Constantine.<eos> You dare threaten the green.
You dare threaten the green.<eos> Dude, your social skills are horrendous.<eos> Please, we aren't here to harm any plants, but our need is urgent.<eos> Don't let your feelings for John stop you from doing what's right.<eos> You have a garden.
That place is heavily warded.<eos> I know we've had our differences, but we could really use your help.<eos> If we don't get a handle on this rotter, he'll threaten all of humanity.<eos> What of it?<eos> You were once human, just like me.
As a fellow showman, this is no way to treat your guests.<eos> Now, settle down!<eos> Stop hitting yourself. Stop hitting yourself. Stop hitting yourself.<eos> Not everything can be solved with your peashooter.<eos> Just because you're dead doesn't mean you're beyond my retribution.
Just because you're dead doesn't mean you're beyond my retribution.<eos> Is that it?<eos> Well, it's off to the old magicians home for you, mate. Pudding night is Thursday.<eos> Try that fireball once more, Constantine.<eos> I'd love to see you cook your own goose.
I'd love to see you cook your own goose.<eos> Let me...<eos> I take it back.<eos> That thing is useful.<eos> Zatanna, where are you, darling?
I take it back.<eos> That thing is useful.<eos> Zatanna, where are you, darling?<eos> I know you can't speak, but give me a wave.<eos> You're the only one here that's really a threat.
Stored magic? Really?<eos> It's the TV dinner of spell casting, dear.<eos> Here's what real magic looks like.<eos> Z!<eos> Z, are you daft?
Stop!<eos> I will kill you, woman!<eos> Z, don't!<eos> Don't kill him.<eos> You can't.
Get control, Z, just like I taught you.<eos> Easy-peasy, lemon squeezy. Deep breaths.<eos> Let it go, love.<eos> Do you see why I can't do what you do?<eos> You lost control is all.
Let it go, love.<eos> Do you see why I can't do what you do?<eos> You lost control is all.<eos> Happens to the best of us.<eos> You've seen me in action, right?
Bad girl.<eos> See, now, you were told to do everything to help me by the master of the House, and that does not include punching.<eos> Bring me to the main room.<eos> I'll take it from here, beautiful.<eos> But I need you out of my hair for now, so why don't you just go for a little walk?
Because Ritchie's bloody well taken control of the House.<eos> This is what you get for having mates.<eos> Boston, can you get inside?<eos> That would be a no.<eos> Ritchie, you're gonna listen to me whether you like it or not.
Too late, Johnny Boy.<eos> Ritchie, please!<eos> Stop while there's still time to save your soul.<eos> Says the man who skates away from everything.<eos> Since you got me infected, I've looked all around the world for a cure and I've finally found it.
So we had to frame Faust and get you to bring me here.<eos> Now I'm immortal and supercharged!<eos> You've been played for a sap.<eos> The Stone isn't sentient.<eos> What's left of Destiny's soul was whispering sweet nothings in your ear, getting you to commit atrocities to gain power and make his move.
Now I'm immortal and supercharged!<eos> You've been played for a sap.<eos> The Stone isn't sentient.<eos> What's left of Destiny's soul was whispering sweet nothings in your ear, getting you to commit atrocities to gain power and make his move.<eos> You're just pissed 'cause I won.
- I... I don't know.<eos> The amount of magic she's used, sometimes you don't recover.<eos> I should have never led her back.<eos> Selfish bastard, I am.<eos> You've done what you can for now, but we have to stop Destiny, or everyone's at risk.
Yes.<eos> My will be done.<eos> Fool!<eos> How can you hope to defeat a god?<eos> Not only can I sense you, you cannot defeat my shield.
John, listen to me.<eos> You've been affected by magic.<eos> Get away to space now.<eos> Sorry to have to ask this, Jason.<eos> At least you're asking.
Call this poetic justice.<eos> Holy crap.<eos> Looks like you've finally beat the curse, my boy.<eos> Wish it were under happier circumstances.<eos> - What are you doing?
Who dares strike at me?<eos> The Defender of the Green... Swamp Thing.<eos> Perfect.<eos> Glad to see you back on your feet, Zatanna.<eos> Whatever you're gonna do, do it fast.
Glad to see you back on your feet, Zatanna.<eos> Whatever you're gonna do, do it fast.<eos> The so-called Guardian of the Green who secretly hopes to be human again.<eos> Let me dispel you of that notion.<eos> Back to the dirt... where you belong.
Back to the dirt... where you belong.<eos> He's getting more powerful by the second.<eos> What the hell are we gonna do?<eos> I say we go and talk to a man about a horse.<eos> Did you hit your head or something? You're babbling.
Well, that's the trouble with someone like me.<eos> Been there, done that.<eos> I shall make you beg for death.<eos> Can I beg you to stop talking?<eos> I mean, all wizards are touched, but you, you're a full-blown nutter.
Can I beg you to stop talking?<eos> I mean, all wizards are touched, but you, you're a full-blown nutter.<eos> I will tear your soul apart.<eos> And what happened to not prattling with mortals?<eos> You chatter like my grandma at a book club.
And what happened to not prattling with mortals?<eos> You chatter like my grandma at a book club.<eos> Now, Boston!<eos> Trick or treat, freak!<eos> Is that a sword in your chest, or are you just glad to see me?
Now, Boston!<eos> Trick or treat, freak!<eos> Is that a sword in your chest, or are you just glad to see me?<eos> Merlin sends his regards.<eos> And by the way, you lose.
And by the way, you lose.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Johnny, I was...<eos> I was under a compulsion.<eos> You've got to save me.
I don't think so.<eos> Johnny, I was...<eos> I was under a compulsion.<eos> You've got to save me.<eos> You owe me. You owe me! Sorry, mate.
Help me, you bastard!<eos> Help me!<eos> That was unpleasant.<eos> What the hell did I miss?<eos> Z, you're okay.
Too bad it took this to get him home.<eos> Batman asked me to be in the Justice League.<eos> And you're considering it?<eos> I visited their headquarters a few days ago.<eos> It's interesting, and like you said, maybe it's time to make a difference.
It's interesting, and like you said, maybe it's time to make a difference.<eos> Listening to me now?<eos> They want you, too.<eos> Good one, Z. Too right, they do.<eos> You have got to be bloody kidding.
This "Chuck" never cared.<eos> "Chuck".<eos> - Are you "Chuck"?<eos> - Yes. I "Chuck", I "Chuck".<eos> Are you the one who will take this man's house?
Did you receive one of these messages?<eos> Department of Retirement. She came in a registered mail.<eos> Yes sir.<eos> Have you ever received good news? Need your signature?<eos> Have you contacted anyone in the factory?
"Sean" boring, and "Nick" punk man Multi-Sexual Relationships.<eos> Sincerity in relationships Obsolete.<eos> I am fond of this and very sexy.<eos> "Ben", it's her only choice.<eos> You will not move to a farm With this high heel shoe.
Oh my God.<eos> This is the ugliest shirt I have ever seen.<eos> Grand.<eos> Well, let's also see what's here.<eos> You grow up quickly, "Kay".
I would like to end your case Factor in a plant like me? Each bimonthly party is held For $ 40 in a bar?<eos> Do not want it.<eos> So I do not like this machine.<eos> No, she does not love you either.<eos> Trust me, I offer you service, You will thank me for this.
Another day, another excellent estimate.<eos> Well done, my little one.<eos> I almost realized the meaning.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> You told me, I quote from your words,
Well done, my little one.<eos> I almost realized the meaning.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> You told me, I quote from your words,<eos> "If you excel in all materials, You'll get a puppy."
This is exactly what you need.<eos> Yes. One does not get enough time.<eos> Look at that nice picture.<eos> Yes, my pet is "Kay".<eos> When you die, You can pass it on as a memory.
30 days ahead.<eos> Who will take your home?<eos> A bank.<eos> They will take your house and not tell us?<eos> What will you do? You lend me money?
The dreams of many have been crushed.<eos> And it does not hurt them at all.<eos> We are three elderly men, If we are bankrupt and bankrupt, We will retire with dignity.<eos> At worst, they will catch us, And we get a bed And three meals a day. And health care Better than that we have now.<eos> Are you talking about us?
No one, it's "Joe".<eos> I do not talk to criminals.<eos> Did you hear that?<eos> I close the line, I'll call back.<eos> What do you want?
What is going on here exactly?<eos> Both lost his mind.<eos> Think about it, "Al".<eos> I do not want to think about anything, I am not a bank robber. Neither are you, nor are you, "Willie."<eos> Why did you answer the phone?
Think about it, "Al".<eos> I do not want to think about anything, I am not a bank robber. Neither are you, nor are you, "Willie."<eos> Why did you answer the phone?<eos> Because he was ringing.<eos> Because you're interested.
Give me that menu.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Wait here, we'll be right back.<eos> What do you do with my list?<eos> Why did you rip my list?
Never happened all my life. That someone stole Full pork pudding.<eos> What was your mother to say?<eos> Perform a major operation or go home.<eos> The thief must have been black.<eos> And why did you do it?
I brought you here. I'll take you, so I'm the driver of the escape.<eos> Do not give yourself greater than its size. Leading like my grandmother, She was driving a horse and cart.<eos> This is a good joke, so you can go back Walk home.<eos> Do not touch my car.<eos> You will not force us to walk!
Lord, you will be great bank robbers.<eos> They catch you stealing from Valle Town!<eos> I hate him when he is right.<eos> We will need the help of a professional.<eos> Do you think so?
Do you know any criminals?<eos> I know a poor person.<eos> - I do not speak English.<eos> - I know that you are, "Murphy".<eos> What are you doing here, Joe?
What is your position now?<eos> Currently, anxiety.<eos> "Joe," I do not mean to be rude With family members.<eos> Former family members.<eos> As you say, but what do you want from me?
Why do you think I know Such people?<eos> I thought that like you They mix with the likes of them.<eos> Like me? I mean businessmen?<eos> No, but the abject. Debt evaders.<eos> I trust you can guide us. To the right path.
I am in need of your abuse. The world hurts me enough.<eos> Within 20 days, There will be no roof for me.<eos> Social security check is worthless, And the pension went into the wind.<eos> The three of us will carry out the process.<eos> If you want 25 percent for our help, There is nothing wrong with it.

Keep your hobbies to yourself!
He guessed.<eos> Two or three years?<eos> That's it?<eos> Looks great health!<eos> It's just a feeling, you asked me.
What about you?<eos> In my opinion, seven years.<eos> What about you, "Al"?<eos> I have a bad luck, I'll probably live up to 100.<eos> So, you can throw away both of us.
Your weapons exist only in anticipation For the worst scenarios.<eos> You must master the shooting, But the last thing you want Is to shoot one.<eos> Who guards the door?<eos> I will, I will guard the door.<eos> Do you know how to deal with a pistol?
Maximum, increase or decrease.<eos> Take a nap, young man.<eos> Well, you too, young man.<eos> Do not let the omelet touch the fruit, She loves them separately.<eos> Do you do this every day? - Every day.
- Do not cheat.<eos> Not fooled.<eos> I wish my father had done this to me.<eos> And your daughter wishes that too.<eos> What are you doing here?
He is not good at ending things.<eos> I give him a chance, my dear, for my sake.<eos> Surely "Joe", But only because you are my best friend.<eos> I love you, my little girl.<eos> You will achieve a lot in life.
No, I'm as strong as a bull.<eos> Well. It's carnival day, I have many tasks.<eos> Yes, I will come after school.<eos> Yes, I'll bring you fried dumplings Bear your name.<eos> Well, you guarantee me a bit, I love you too.
See you later, Dad.<eos> I was bothering you Long ago, "Murphy".<eos> I think I deserved it. Most often.<eos> This is the smartest thing you have ever said in your life.<eos> Listen, Joe. Whatever you do, You do not have to.
I think I deserved it. Most often.<eos> This is the smartest thing you have ever said in your life.<eos> Listen, Joe. Whatever you do, You do not have to.<eos> There is always another way.<eos> It is my business, boy, Forget that you know.
This is the smartest thing you have ever said in your life.<eos> Listen, Joe. Whatever you do, You do not have to.<eos> There is always another way.<eos> It is my business, boy, Forget that you know.<eos> In the end, if I do not, You have to take responsibility.
There is always another way.<eos> It is my business, boy, Forget that you know.<eos> In the end, if I do not, You have to take responsibility.<eos> I can no longer cover you.<eos> You are a father.
In the end, if I do not, You have to take responsibility.<eos> I can no longer cover you.<eos> You are a father.<eos> You must take responsibility She acts like a man.<eos> Even if you have to pretend to do so.
I was joking, Milton.<eos> Well, that's very funny.<eos> Stay here, I have to check the karaoke machine.<eos> I can not, Go to the Yarn Girls' Booth.<eos> "Milton," you are in it now.
I can not breathe When I wear masks, too.<eos> You are very nice.<eos> Two minutes.<eos> What is going on in Heaven?<eos> Can you get out of here?
This is my bank!<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> Do not move!<eos> I do not move?<eos> I'm not telling me not to move, You do not move!
I must speak with you.<eos> I lost this age yesterday.<eos> Did the tooth fairy come?<eos> She brought me five dollars.<eos> You are a renegade.
So, between approximately 2.30 and 3.30 hours, You are.<eos> In the toilet?<eos> Yes. It's boring, But I take what I always read with me. Helps to spend time.<eos> After that, I met my girlfriend, And we sing along with the karaoke machine.<eos> Do you mind washing my dirty clothes?
It is not here.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Yes, I'm sure.<eos> I have a wonderful memory.<eos> Listen, do you want to look again?
I have a wonderful memory.<eos> Listen, do you want to look again?<eos> Not really.<eos> Can I go home now?<eos> I thought you would not come.
You are not stronger than this.<eos> I'm not solid. I am a very sensitive person.<eos> I will be honest with you. I do not want to die today.<eos> This is new.<eos> But if I die, I want to say. You were a great classmate and friend. For 25 years.
When she gets back, tell her Madame Rossetti wants to see her at once.<eos> Thanks, Mimi.<eos> God, that bitch Danielle probably told her about me smoking.<eos> She's always kissing her ass.<eos> Maybe you shouldn't go out.
Maybe you shouldn't go out.<eos> He's waiting for me.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> I didn't think you were going to make it.
- Sorry.<eos> - It's okay.<eos> I'm glad you got here.<eos> Let's go.<eos> You make this yourself?
- What?<eos> It's my dad.<eos> What?<eos> Sometimes he hires people.<eos> What do you mean?
Faster!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> He's gone.<eos> Come on.<eos> What are you doing?
The people who want you dead own half the police in Europe.<eos> I... I don't understand what's going on.<eos> I don't even know your name.<eos> My name is Lucas.<eos> You should get down, under the dash.
They don't even want me around.<eos> Sometimes dads make mistakes.<eos> I c... I can't... I can't stay in here anymore.<eos> I told you, I'm claustrophobic.<eos> Yeah, you can.
Trusted me.<eos> I slit his throat with my knife.<eos> Three days I stayed there, just elbow-deep in his blood.<eos> Funny thing, we were in the wrong place... just watching a civilian's house.<eos> So if I can do that... you can stay in that trunk.
Find the girl, find Lucas, and get me my fucking money.<eos> Do you feel that's good enough?<eos> I'll keep practicing, sir.<eos> Hey, quite a place you've got here.<eos> - Where did you find him?
The most important thing for this test's success is not to show fear.<eos> Try to seem like the aggressor.<eos> Fass!<eos> I've been expecting your call.<eos> How did you find them?
Teresa's still a good-looking woman.<eos> Oh, and... Jillian's swim team won their final.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> I'm guessing Ella Hatto reminded you of your daughter.<eos> Why do you want her dead?
He had to be punished.<eos> He stole a lot of money.<eos> Your delay forced my hand.<eos> I had to send Metzger overseas to pay Mr. Hatto and his wife a visit.<eos> Well, if that's true, and I do this... aren't you just punishing a dead man?
He stole a lot of money.<eos> Your delay forced my hand.<eos> I had to send Metzger overseas to pay Mr. Hatto and his wife a visit.<eos> Well, if that's true, and I do this... aren't you just punishing a dead man?<eos> Lucas, do you know how many people are in my employ?
Well, if that's true, and I do this... aren't you just punishing a dead man?<eos> Lucas, do you know how many people are in my employ?<eos> If I let one steal from me, what are the rest to think?<eos> The message is not for Martin Hatto. It is for them.<eos> Lucas... you have such potential, such talent.
The message is not for Martin Hatto. It is for them.<eos> Lucas... you have such potential, such talent.<eos> A fine weapon, Lucas. You're a hunter.<eos> That's what you are.<eos> At the moment, you're confused.
At the moment, you're confused.<eos> I expect your supply is running low.<eos> Must be difficult...<eos> I'd say impossible... to find a cocktail of the quality I supply you with on the streets.<eos> You don't know what you're doing with this girl.
Must be difficult...<eos> I'd say impossible... to find a cocktail of the quality I supply you with on the streets.<eos> You don't know what you're doing with this girl.<eos> But one way or another, this girl will die.<eos> You have to know that.
I waited too long.<eos> So they killed your whole family.<eos> Now, they're gonna want to kill us both.<eos> I didn't know what you'd like.<eos> You should eat something.
So they killed your whole family.<eos> Now, they're gonna want to kill us both.<eos> I didn't know what you'd like.<eos> You should eat something.<eos> We're gonna be on the run, and you're gonna need your strength.
Ella, get in!<eos> Come on, there could be more of them.<eos> Come on!<eos> You... you drive.<eos> You drive.
I got 90 on my algebra test.<eos> Oh, I'm so proud of you, William.<eos> I did get one wrong.<eos> And how's everything at home?<eos> Hey, you can talk to me, you know?
So that's her.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thanks for coming.<eos> I wish that just once you'd call me up for dinner and a movie, hmm?
Thanks for coming.<eos> I wish that just once you'd call me up for dinner and a movie, hmm?<eos> Slip in the shower?<eos> Yeah, something like that.<eos> They say you kidnapped her.
It's not like that.<eos> It's all over the news.<eos> Let's get started.<eos> Ella, this is Dani.<eos> Maybe you should go for a walk while she finishes up.
How's he doing?<eos> He'll be okay.<eos> He's fairly indestructible.<eos> May I ask you a question?<eos> What are you doing with him?
Then, you're really fucked up.<eos> Is it a schoolgirl crush or just looking for Daddy, hmm?<eos> Sit.<eos> I'm trying to help you.<eos> If you think he cares about you, you're wrong.
The only thing he cares about is his fix.<eos> Getting high, that's all what he's about.<eos> He's a junkie, always was and always will be.<eos> And I get it, there's a thrill in trying to rescue a man.<eos> I mean, it's so exciting when you think you have the power to awaken something good inside him.
He's not coming back.<eos> Not for you. Well, not for me, not for anyone.<eos> So, if I were you and had Richard Addison trying to kill me, I'd take this, get off at the next station, and I'd run.<eos> And don't look back.<eos> Hey, what are you doing?
You did a good job.<eos> This isn't even your stop.<eos> We are now arriving in Lille.<eos> Please ensure you take all your belongings with you...<eos> Lucas, you know what I'm thinking?
Where's Ella?<eos> Um, she's in the dining car.<eos> She's having some food.<eos> She's fine.<eos> You have time.
You have time.<eos> Do it.<eos> Lucas, come on.<eos> Your body wants it.<eos> Why do you want me to do it so much?
you go and you do it?<eos> Take it.<eos> Put that in there.<eos> Pull that back.<eos> You hear that?
Take it.<eos> Put that in there.<eos> Pull that back.<eos> You hear that?<eos> You know what that means?
Put that in there.<eos> Pull that back.<eos> You hear that?<eos> You know what that means?<eos> Now you got a bullet in the chamber.
Addison.<eos> He killed my father.<eos> Don't laugh at me.<eos> What? Are you afraid of him?<eos> You don't understand.
What? Are you afraid of him?<eos> You don't understand.<eos> What is there to understand?<eos> He's trying to kill us both.<eos> When you take a life... it takes... yours.
You're telling me Richard Addison of Addison Industries murdered your family.<eos> You've got to tell me the truth.<eos> You've walked into Richard Addison's office with a loaded weapon.<eos> You are in so much trouble.<eos> You better have some news, Banks.
They're sending a subpoena to the Swiss government.<eos> How long have we got?<eos> A few hours... maybe.<eos> And then the account's frozen.<eos> Then, you'd better get her out of there and get my money, don't you think?
Tell him I'm done.<eos> He won't see me again.<eos> So, now what?<eos> - Don't judge me, Lucas. - Mm-hmm?<eos> You're in no position.
There's a price on your head.<eos> It's not personal.<eos> It's just... it's just business.<eos> Sorry.<eos> It's just you don't want to do this.
Get her out.<eos> - No, no, no!<eos> - Move!<eos> Come on!<eos> You disappointed me, Lucas.
I know you're there.<eos> I just wanted to tell you we got the girl.<eos> She's been taken care of.<eos> I guess all your trouble was for nothing.<eos> You're on the run by now, I expect.
I guess all your trouble was for nothing.<eos> You're on the run by now, I expect.<eos> I don't suppose I'll find you.<eos> Not that it really matters.<eos> You're not worth it.
I don't suppose I'll find you.<eos> Not that it really matters.<eos> You're not worth it.<eos> You and I are done.<eos> You no longer exist.
- Find Agatha.<eos> No one's answering at the gate, and I cannot reach anyone in security.<eos> Lucas.<eos> Stop.<eos> - Why are you doing this?
- Why are you doing this?<eos> - This is who I am, right?<eos> This is madness.<eos> Because of this girl?<eos> You'll wake up tomorrow morning, you won't remember her name, her face, just like the others.
Tell him!<eos> Do it.<eos> Metzger, take it off.<eos> Ella, you listen to me.<eos> You're gonna get out of here.
Shoot<eos> Ella.<eos> Ella. Ella, stay with me.<eos> Ella?<eos> Why did you save me?
Uh, yeah, she's nice.<eos> I don't really know her that well.<eos> And my cousins, they're... they're treating me, I don't know... like I'm normal.<eos> Well, that's good.<eos> Well, I just wanted to check in and see that you're doing okay.
And my cousins, they're... they're treating me, I don't know... like I'm normal.<eos> Well, that's good.<eos> Well, I just wanted to check in and see that you're doing okay.<eos> Lucas...<eos> Did you ever go see your daughter?
I cannot believe it.<eos> What was the last fucking thing I told you?<eos> Mind and mention the diminished responsibility, you fucking dumb Cunt!<eos> I think it would be better if we brought this meeting to a close, and you and I get together once you've had time to reflect upon the situation.<eos> So you gonna press that little yellow button or no?
Dudes who need to tend to the livestock.<eos> So that was me.<eos> No job, no money.<eos> No access to the little fella.<eos> And then you went back on the heroin.
Come on in.<eos> All right?<eos> - You ready?<eos> - Aye.<eos> You got it?
You fucking prick!<eos> - You've stabbed us in the liver.<eos> - Shit.<eos> Sorry, Franco. Shit.<eos> You still want me to do the second one?
Don't you fucking touch her.<eos> You in this with her, are you?<eos> You fuck!<eos> Fuck off!<eos> I see you again, Cunt, you fucking die.
Well, calm down, okay?<eos> Worked the first time okay, didn't it?<eos> - I'm going back to work for Doyle.<eos> - Doyle?<eos> No, no, no, you're not doing that.
- Why not?<eos> - Doyle's a gangster.<eos> In the sauna, no man would dare to hurt a woman.<eos> Mr. Doyle won't let that happen.<eos> I don't like to think of you working there, okay?
How is this better?<eos> I could have been killed and you would have done nothing because you were sitting next door, taking cocaine.<eos> Please, I want to go home.<eos> It was very peaceful at the end.<eos> She kept your room exactly how you left it.

"You shouldn't have to read this, because I already made you suffer too much.<eos> "But I know that you and Fergus<eos> "are living in a better world without all my chaos.<eos> "I'm sorry for all the things I destroyed.<eos> "You are so beautiful.
What the fuck are you doing to me?<eos> I was just fucking saving your life!<eos> Save my life?<eos> You ruined my fucking life, Mark.<eos> You ruined it!
I was just fucking saving your life!<eos> Save my life?<eos> You ruined my fucking life, Mark.<eos> You ruined it!<eos> Now you're ruining my fucking death, too!
Thanks a lot, Amigo.<eos> Fucking shit!<eos> I did what I could for you!<eos> I gave you £4,000!<eos> What did you think I was gonna do with £4,000, Mark?
I did what I could for you!<eos> I gave you £4,000!<eos> What did you think I was gonna do with £4,000, Mark?<eos> I was a fucking junkie!<eos> Aye, suppose you were.
Everyone says that.<eos> Gonna be sticking around for a while?<eos> No, I'm supposed to go back in a couple of days.<eos> Can you not stay a bit longer?<eos> It'd be nice to see you, get to, you know, spend some time together.
Don't go trying to kill yourself again, eh?<eos> No.<eos> Not while I got my friend in town, eh?<eos> So...<eos> You see old Simon?
Simon?<eos> No, no.<eos> He's probably too busy.<eos> You got to see old Simon, man.<eos> You know how it was, Spud.
I did an accounting course.<eos> I work for a small business.<eos> Stock management software for the retail sector.<eos> Very nice.<eos> Well, as you can see, I'm running my old auntie's pub.
Well, that's why I came in the back window, woman.<eos> Do you still got my kitbag?<eos> - Of course.<eos> - Good.<eos> Frank, you're bleeding.
Ya fucking beauty.<eos> But, Dad...<eos> That's right, son.<eos> I'm home.<eos> But what are you gonna do?
Almost halfway, Spud.<eos> Come on.<eos> Thanks, brother.<eos> Can't fail again, Mark.<eos> You know, I need to detox the system.
It doesn't mean anything.<eos> It's not getting it out of your body that's the problem.<eos> It's getting it out of your mind.<eos> You are an addict.<eos> You think I haven't heard that 100,000 times, Mark?
Be addicted to something else.<eos> Like running until I feel sick?<eos> Yes.<eos> Or something else.<eos> You've got to channel it.
Like running until I feel sick?<eos> Yes.<eos> Or something else.<eos> You've got to channel it.<eos> You've got to control it.
Some people do boxing.<eos> - Boxing?<eos> - Well, it's just an example.<eos> I don't...<eos> I don't mean you should...
I don't mean you should...<eos> So, what did you channel it into?<eos> Getting away.<eos> Do you remember, Mark...<eos> You remember that girl, Sharron?
Your very first sexual encounter.<eos> - Right.<eos> - Mine too.<eos> Okay.<eos> You remember shoplifting in Woolworths together and you got caught, you gave my name?
And we shared a needle.<eos> Shared a needle, yeah.<eos> You went first.<eos> Your blood runs in my veins, Mark.<eos> Would you stop looking at your fucking watch?
- Shit.<eos> Excuse me a moment.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Fuck!<eos> So you're Plan B.
- And the children?<eos> - There aren't any.<eos> - None?<eos> - No.<eos> So when you said wife, two kids... James and...
So when you said wife, two kids... James and...<eos> - Laura.<eos> - Laura, that wasn't strictly true?<eos> - No.<eos> - Why'd you lie to me?
I've got nowhere that I think of as a home.<eos> I don't really know anyone.<eos> And what's the substance of our acquaintance?<eos> Friendship, please.<eos> You ask me to get involved in some stupid scheme to finance and establish and run a brothel.
- A brothel.<eos> - Well...<eos> The sad thing is...<eos> The most pathetic thing of all is that I can't think of anything better.<eos> So you're gonna help me?
What is this?<eos> Come here.<eos> Just do exactly what I told you.<eos> You'll be fine.<eos> Grab anything you can carry.
Bring in the telly.<eos> Who's this, then?<eos> This big handsome bastard is none other than my son.<eos> Franco Junior, meet Mikey Forrester.<eos> - So you're teaching him the trade?
You not gonna give us a song?<eos> I-I-I-I can sing.<eos> I'll just...<eos> I'll just fucking make something up.<eos> You can play the piano.
I'll just...<eos> I'll just fucking make something up.<eos> You can play the piano.<eos> I can't play the fucking piano.<eos> You know those two chords.
I'll just fucking make something up.<eos> You can play the piano.<eos> I can't play the fucking piano.<eos> You know those two chords.<eos> The fucking F and G march you used to play at school.
No?<eos> He played for Hibs in 1979 between stints for the Fort Lauderdale Strikers and the San Jose Earthquakes.<eos> I went to see him play, apparently.<eos> My dad took me.<eos> He said, "You've got to see this.

I couldn't see a thing.<eos> Not a single thing.<eos> Not for 90 minutes.<eos> But I've got the programme, so...<eos> I mean, I've always got that, you know?
Double jab.<eos> Double jab, right hand.<eos> One, two.<eos> Junior.<eos> You coming, for fuck's sake?
It's just, he's not really...<eos> "Not really," what?<eos> Sorry, Dad.<eos> The fuck is that?<eos> You cannot go with me dressed like that.
You cannot go with me dressed like that.<eos> See, I don't really think, you know, I'm into it.<eos> - He doesn't want to go, Frank.<eos> - Doesn't want to go?<eos> Where else you gonna go?
Well, that's a blow and no mistake, no two ways about that.<eos> Sorry, Dad.<eos> Some way to treat your old man.<eos> - Please, Frank.<eos> - You shut the fuck up!
Some way to treat your old man.<eos> - Please, Frank.<eos> - You shut the fuck up!<eos> Hotel fucking management.<eos> You put him up to this.
- No, Frank.<eos> - Dad, leave it. - "Leave it"?<eos> I don't want to fucking leave it!<eos> What if I don't want to fucking leave it?<eos> What you gonna do about that, eh?
Stick one on then, you Cunt.<eos> Take a fucking swipe at me.<eos> Do it.<eos> Do it!<eos> No, you cannot fucking do that.
Take a fucking swipe at me.<eos> Do it.<eos> Do it!<eos> No, you cannot fucking do that.<eos> See, if you were my son, you'd have stabbed us there.
Do it!<eos> No, you cannot fucking do that.<eos> See, if you were my son, you'd have stabbed us there.<eos> I'd be lying, breathing my last through a hole in my chest.<eos> But you cannot fucking do that.
Right.<eos> As well as the cocaine, of course.<eos> Well, that was just for personal use.<eos> Quite a lot for personal use.<eos> Well, you know Simon.
No.<eos> Not for 20 years.<eos> That's really good.<eos> Well done.<eos> So, are you the woman in the video?
"which may be followed by an invitation to present a business plan."<eos> Blah, blah, fucking blah.<eos> I'm trying to help you, Simon.<eos> We're blowing all that cashpoint money on lawyer's fees.<eos> You could've got someone cheaper.
Blah, blah, fucking blah.<eos> I'm trying to help you, Simon.<eos> We're blowing all that cashpoint money on lawyer's fees.<eos> You could've got someone cheaper.<eos> Well, I wouldn't have had to get anyone at all if you hadn't engaged in fucking blackmail.
What, all of it?<eos> You snorted the whole fucking wad?<eos> It's called debt, Mark.<eos> The point is, we need cash now, not in six months' time.<eos> And you realize what's at stake here?
And if I don't get it up and running soon, she's gonna leave me.<eos> - Fucking leave you anyway. - No, it's not gonna happen.<eos> - Is she actually even with you?<eos> - She's my girlfriend.<eos> You've never even fucked her.
Simon, you're a romantic.<eos> Veronika and I have had our rough patches.<eos> I'll be the first to admit that.<eos> Shall we submit this application?<eos> Do what you want, but I need someone on-site working.
- All right, Mark.<eos> - Come in.<eos> When clients come in, I want a sense of space.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Maybe some soft lighting, help punters feel a bit more relaxed and that, you know?
Out well towards the right, Fine 'n' Dandy is racing solo early on.<eos> Steventon Star down the center with Jacob's Pillow.<eos> Hello, Franco.<eos> Simon.<eos> - But you're not...
Fucking shut up.<eos> Yeah, sorry if I seemed a little shocked to see you, Frank.<eos> Well, I was gonna...<eos> I was gonna deal with this myself and then give you the good news, but...<eos> You're not gonna believe this.
I was gonna deal with this myself and then give you the good news, but...<eos> You're not gonna believe this.<eos> So, two days ago, I got a call from an old friend of mine.<eos> Gav Temperly.<eos> You remember him?
I'm his girlfriend, but it's business, really.<eos> Simon is not a good person.<eos> But I like him.<eos> More than he likes himself, I think.<eos> Right, but if you're not...
But I like him.<eos> More than he likes himself, I think.<eos> Right, but if you're not...<eos> If there's no physical aspect to your relationship,<eos> I mean, you don't want to be, like...

I like you, Mark.<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> I'm going to be the madame in Simon's bordello.<eos> But really...<eos> What are you gonna do?
But...<eos> To go home with nothing?<eos> No qualification, no career, not even bringing money.<eos> What's at home?<eos> You know.
You know.<eos> Emotional attachment.<eos> That's all.<eos> - All set? - Yeah, fine.<eos> You're okay?
Me and Mark used to steal all kinds of stuff, actually.<eos> Till we got caught.<eos> He got off.<eos> I got six months.<eos> Still, you find out what you're good at inside.

- Two hours to the next train.<eos> - Oh, for fuck's sake.<eos> Look, we're here as an act of memorial.<eos> Nostalgia.<eos> That's why you're here.
- Oh, for fuck's sake.<eos> Look, we're here as an act of memorial.<eos> Nostalgia.<eos> That's why you're here.<eos> You're a tourist in your own youth.

Nostalgia.<eos> That's why you're here.<eos> You're a tourist in your own youth.<eos> Just 'cause you had a near-death experience, and now you're feeling all fuzzy and warm.<eos> What other moments will you be revisiting?
- Twenty-three.<eos> How innocent was that?<eos> Aye, that's mine.<eos> How's yours?<eos> Don't know what you're talking about.
Maybe kids of her own.<eos> But she never got that far, did she?<eos> Never got to lead her life.<eos> Because her father, someone who should have been looking after her, protecting his own infant, was too busy filling his own veins with heroin to check that she was breathing properly.<eos> How do you keep a lid on that one?
Go, go, go!<eos> Fuck!<eos> Go on, then, you fucking Cunt, you!<eos> Fuck.<eos> Go! Would you fucking go?
I didn't know.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> I might've heard something.<eos> I'm sorry I didn't mention it.<eos> You might've heard something?
You might've heard something?<eos> All right, fuck it.<eos> I knew.<eos> I knew, and I could have served you up to him on a plate any time I wanted to.<eos> I bet you were fucking looking forward to it, too, weren't you?
Fuck's sake.<eos> "Probably right enough, Mr. Doyle."<eos> If you groveled a bit more, we might not be going home in the buff.<eos> At least I have my dignity.<eos> Is that what you're calling it?
Fucking joke.<eos> What is all this shit anyway?<eos> It's just, like, stories and that.<eos> "Stories"?<eos> What are you writing stories for?
Read on.<eos> "The boy, likes, just wouldn't hand over the wallet,<eos> "even when Begbie pulled the knife, like.<eos> "The last words I heard the dude say was,<eos> "'You won't use that.'
Blood.<eos> Mixing with the piss.<eos> It was an ugly sight, man.<eos> Murphy.<eos> You've got hidden talents, man.
I'm only gonna fucking ask you this once.<eos> How much money did he leave you?<eos> £4,000.<eos> Left it in a locker.<eos> Well, you didn't fucking tell us that at the time.
"Why wouldn't he?"<eos> Daniel?<eos> It's me.<eos> I'm not here.<eos> - What do you mean, you're not here? - Go!
Daniel?<eos> It's me.<eos> I'm not here.<eos> - What do you mean, you're not here? - Go!<eos> Veronika, you cannot be here.
- Simon.<eos> - Simon?<eos> Good old Simon.<eos> And what about Simon's very best friend?<eos> You know him and all?
- Simon?<eos> Good old Simon.<eos> And what about Simon's very best friend?<eos> You know him and all?<eos> You got a phone?
You know him and all?<eos> You got a phone?<eos> - A phone? - Aye.<eos> A mobile phone.<eos> You know the kind of thing.
A mobile phone.<eos> You know the kind of thing.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Give it.<eos> But you have to let us go.
But you have to let us go.<eos> Both of us.<eos> - Another?<eos> - No, I'm fine.<eos> Where are you going?
Both of us.<eos> - Another?<eos> - No, I'm fine.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> You shouldn't be out in this neck of the woods, kitten-cat.
So...<eos> Look after yourself, son.<eos> The old Wino was my father.<eos> This fool is yours.<eos> You'll be a better man than either of us.
I loved that woman.<eos> Mark!<eos> I'm so sorry!<eos> I've done a terrible thing!<eos> - Fuck are you doing here?
- Franco!<eos> Veronika! Gail!<eos> Little Fergus.<eos> Well, he's not so little any more.<eos> You seen him recently?
Little Fergus.<eos> Well, he's not so little any more.<eos> You seen him recently?<eos> He's really shot up...<eos> What the fuck are you talking about, Murphy?
And then... Then there is a betrayal.<eos> We've all heard that one before, eh, Mark?<eos> - Aye, maybe.<eos> - Aye, fucking maybe.<eos> Aye, well, like you said, 20 years has just flown by, eh?
We're all in a box.<eos> Just waiting for the lid to come down.<eos> - Frank, come on.<eos> - You knew.<eos> Stringing me along, so you were.
Fucking deal with you later.<eos> Now...<eos> Rent Boy.<eos> You and me.<eos> You know, I killed a man once.
You know, I killed a man once.<eos> A man who'd done nothing to me.<eos> Cunt just looked at me the wrong way in a moment when I was thinking of you.<eos> I've been thinking about you for 20 year.<eos> When you robbed us.
I remember my first day at primary school.<eos> My very first day.<eos> And the teacher, she said,<eos> "Good morning, Mark.<eos> You can sit here, next to Francis."
Here.<eos> Come on.<eos> Franco!<eos> "So she puts it to Spud..."<eos> It will be safe if you leave with me.
Well, I believe I have.<eos> The problem is, I can't remember what!<eos> Oh, well.<eos> I'm sure it will come to me.<eos> Where are you off to?
Bonjour, good day, how is your wife?<eos> I need six eggs That's too expensive<eos> There must be more than this provincial life<eos> Ah, if it isn't the only bookworm in town.<eos> So, where did you run off to this week?
Two cities in Northern Italy.<eos> I didn't want to come back!<eos> Have you got any new places to go?<eos> I'm afraid not.<eos> But you may reread any of the old ones that you'd like.
My future wife.<eos> Belle is the most beautiful girl in the village.<eos> That makes her the best.<eos> But she's so well-read.<eos> And you're so...
No, LeFou.<eos> It's the ones who play hard to get that are always the sweetest prey.<eos> That's what makes Belle so appealing.<eos> She hasn't made a fool of herself just to gain my favor.<eos> What would you call that?
Somehow a time and place stand still<eos> Love lives on inside our hearts<eos> And always will<eos> Belle.<eos> Could you... Hand me a...
- Papa, do you think I'm odd?<eos> - Odd?<eos> My daughter?<eos> Odd?<eos> Where did you get an idea like that?
Odd?<eos> Where did you get an idea like that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> People talk.<eos> This is a small village, you know.
Your mother was... fearless.<eos> Fearless.<eos> So... what can I bring you from the market?<eos> A rose. Like the one in the painting.<eos> You ask for that every year!
Fearless.<eos> So... what can I bring you from the market?<eos> A rose. Like the one in the painting.<eos> You ask for that every year!<eos> And every year you bring it.
You have my word.<eos> - Goodbye, Papa.<eos> - Goodbye, Belle.<eos> Come on, Philippe.<eos> You know the way.
I'll see you tomorrow!<eos> Right.<eos> Tomorrow, with the rose.<eos> Stay safe.<eos> What are you doing?
"That flies...<eos> "over the dark...<eos> "wood."<eos> That was amazing!<eos> What on earth are you doing?
What on earth are you doing?<eos> Teaching another girl to read?<eos> Isn't one enough?<eos> We have to do something.<eos> You are the wildest... most gorgeous thing I have ever seen.
Belle!<eos> I heard you had trouble with the Headmaster.<eos> He never liked me either.<eos> Can I give you a little advice about the villagers though?<eos> They're never going to trust the kind of change you're trying to bring.
They're never going to trust the kind of change you're trying to bring.<eos> All I wanted was to teach a child to read.<eos> The only children you should concern yourself with... are your own.<eos> I'm... not ready to have children.<eos> Maybe you haven't met the right man.
I'm... not ready to have children.<eos> Maybe you haven't met the right man.<eos> It's a small village, Gaston.<eos> I've met them all.<eos> Well, maybe you should take another look.
And for once it might be grand<eos> To have someone understand<eos> I want so much more Than they've got planned<eos> The woods are lovely. I only wish I recognized them.<eos> Do you know where we are, Philippe?
Philippe!<eos> Good boy.<eos> Go, boy.<eos> Go!<eos> Oh, Philippe, you saved my life.
Who's there?<eos> Papa?<eos> Papa, is that you?<eos> Belle!<eos> How did you find me?
Belle!<eos> How did you find me?<eos> Your hands are ice.<eos> We need to get you home.<eos> Belle, you must leave here at once!
I would risk anything to kiss you again, Plumette.<eos> No, my love.<eos> I've been burned by you before.<eos> We must be strong.<eos> How can I be strong when you make me so weak?
Looking so down in the dumps<eos> Every guy here'd love to be you, Gaston<eos> Even when taking your lumps<eos> There's no man in town as admired as you<eos> You're everyone's favorite guy
I believe there's another 'T'<eos> It just occurred to me that I'm illiterate<eos> And I've never actually had to spell it out loud before<eos> Gaston<eos> Oh, LeFou, you're the best.
Oh, everyone, calm yourselves.<eos> - We still have time.<eos> - Mama... am I ever going to be a boy again?<eos> Oh, yes, Chip.<eos> You'll have your days... in the sun again.
Yes, I will make sure of it.<eos> But did you see her stand up to him?<eos> I am telling you, this girl is the one.<eos> They must fall in love if we are to be human again... and how can they fall in love if she stays in her room?<eos> Hey, Chapeau, you missed a spot.
If Maurice won't give me his blessing... then he is in my way.<eos> Once the wolves are finished with him...<eos> Belle will have no one to take care of her but me.<eos> For the sake of exhausting all of our options... do we maybe wanna consider a slightly less... gruesome alternative?<eos> Are you coming?
Not until my whole life is done<eos> Will I ever leave you<eos> Will I tremble again<eos> To my dear one's gorgeous refrain<eos> Will you now forever remain
Perhaps there's something there That wasn't there before<eos> What, Mama?<eos> There may be something there That wasn't there before<eos> What is it? What's there?<eos> I'll tell you when you're older.
What is it? What's there?<eos> I'll tell you when you're older.<eos> Okay, I'm older!<eos> Chip...<eos> You are a one.
I'm sorry I ever called your father a thief.<eos> Let's go home.<eos> This is some storm, huh?<eos> At least we're not tied to a tree in the middle of nowhere... surrounded by bloodthirsty wolves.<eos> You know it's not too late.
We could always turn back...<eos> It's just... every time I close my eyes...<eos> And then when I open them... he's...<eos> Maurice!<eos> Gaston... did you try to kill Maurice?
We can't do that, miss.<eos> But we'll take very good care of him.<eos> My father's not crazy.<eos> Gaston, tell him!<eos> You know how loyal I am to your family... but your father's been making some unbelievable claims.
You know how loyal I am to your family... but your father's been making some unbelievable claims.<eos> It's true, Belle.<eos> He's been raving about a beast... in a castle!<eos> I've just come from the castle and there is a beast!<eos> You'd say anything to set him free. Your word is hardly proof.
Shut up!<eos> You won't get away with this, Gaston!<eos> Oh, Belle!<eos> Gaston, with all due respect...<eos> Do you want to be next?
At least he has finally learned to love.<eos> A lot of good that does us if she doesn't love him in return.<eos> No.<eos> This is the first time I've had any real hope she would.<eos> Did you hear that, Mama?
Let's kill the beast!<eos> We need help.<eos> - I have to warn the Beast.<eos> - Warn him?<eos> How did you get away from him?
How did you get away from him?<eos> He let me go, Papa.<eos> He sent me back to you.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Where did you...
Then you know why I had to leave her there. I had to protect you.<eos> I've always tried to protect my little girl.<eos> Probably too much.<eos> I understand.<eos> Will you help me now?
I know what to do.<eos> Kill the beast!<eos> Kill the beast!<eos> Kill the beast!<eos> Are you not the least bit concerned... that this castle might be haunted?
Are you in love with her?<eos> Did you honestly think she'd want you?<eos> Belle!<eos> Where is he?<eos> When we return to the village... you will marry me. And that beast's head...
Plumette!<eos> Plumette!<eos> Chip!<eos> Look at you!<eos> You're a little boy again!
Chip!<eos> Look at you!<eos> You're a little boy again!<eos> What did I tell you, darling?<eos> You smell so good!
Look at me!<eos> Look at me!<eos> You're hurting me. Listen.<eos> Hisfatherwas anelderin thechurch.<eos> What are you looking at, boy?
Thanks.<eos> Look at me, baby.<eos> Daddies aren't supposed to do that to their kids.<eos> It ain't love.<eos> You understand?
Sing with me, as those who feel led make their way to the altar.<eos> ThatSunday, whenthepreachercalled heknewhe couldn't staysilentanylonger.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> That's all right.<eos> Just tell him what you're sorry for.
I can't make him stop.<eos> I try, but when he drinks, he beats my mom.<eos> I try to protect her.<eos> But I can't!<eos> Mack's dad: Why do you make me do this, boy?
I try, but when he drinks, he beats my mom.<eos> I try to protect her.<eos> But I can't!<eos> Mack's dad: Why do you make me do this, boy?<eos> Why do you embarrass me in front of my people?
Okay, come on.<eos> It was a nice try, you little rascal.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Hi, guys.<eos> Hi. Mack, did you catch the game last night?
Good morning.<eos> Hi, guys.<eos> Hi. Mack, did you catch the game last night?<eos> Since when do i control the remote?<eos> I hear one day you get it back.

It's gonna be an awful lonely weekend around here.<eos> I'll bring you back a six-pound brown.<eos> All right.<eos> None of that store-bought stuff. I can tell the difference.<eos> Hey, Willie, have you got a moment?
The falls.<eos> Daddy, we have to stop!<eos> Let's go see the waterfall.<eos> No stopping. We gotta get to the campground before dark.<eos> Well, have you told missy the story of the Indian Princess?
What did she look like?<eos> Well, she was very pretty.<eos> What color was her hair?<eos> Like this.<eos> Do you want me to tell you this story?
That's how multnomah falls was created.<eos> Ready to go?<eos> Shotgun.<eos> A little Patience, please.<eos> You got that off your mommy, didn't ya?

When we get home, your mom will have a good answer for you.<eos> Daddy, will I ever have to jump off a cliff?<eos> No.<eos> No, honey.<eos> You will never have to jump off a cliff.
- There we go. There we go.<eos> That's it.<eos> Missy!<eos> Hey, you can come out, honey. Everyone's fine now.<eos> Emil, have you seen missy?
That's it.<eos> Missy!<eos> Hey, you can come out, honey. Everyone's fine now.<eos> Emil, have you seen missy?<eos> No. You check your camp?

Ground teams found the truck in the mountains.<eos> Okay.<eos> Chopper's waiting, sir.<eos> Mack, you okay?<eos> You're okay? Okay.
You think I wrote this? Mentions the shack.<eos> Signed "papa."<eos> Who else knows that?<eos> Mack, I would never kid about that.<eos> Now, where'd you get it?
Same as always.<eos> She comes out of her shell for a minute, and then retreats.<eos> So I'm gonna take her to my brother's this weekend.<eos> He knows a counselor that we could try, and...<eos> Thought maybe you could join us.
Well, there's no stamp.<eos> No.<eos> Well, if it's not stamped, it's not delivered.<eos> Well, you want your mail while you're here?<eos> What do you need a four-wheel drive for?
Come on.<eos> We been friends for a long time.<eos> Just shoot straight with me.<eos> Is this about that note?<eos> You're not thinking about going back there, are you?
Just shoot straight with me.<eos> Is this about that note?<eos> You're not thinking about going back there, are you?<eos> Well...<eos> Have you talked with nan about this at all?
Well...<eos> Have you talked with nan about this at all?<eos> No, I don't want to upset her.<eos> She's barely holding it together right now.<eos> Have you prayed about it?
No, I don't want to upset her.<eos> She's barely holding it together right now.<eos> Have you prayed about it?<eos> I just want your truck.<eos> But you know this isn't a good idea, right?
But you know this isn't a good idea, right?<eos> I mean, what if it is that guy?<eos> And then he's trying to get you out there for who knows what reason.<eos> We don't know that yet.<eos> You already think about the other possibility?
And then he's trying to get you out there for who knows what reason.<eos> We don't know that yet.<eos> You already think about the other possibility?<eos> What?<eos> You think it's god?
We don't know that yet.<eos> You already think about the other possibility?<eos> What?<eos> You think it's god?<eos> You're the one who said there were no tracks in the snow.
I hope it goes well with you, too.<eos> Sweetie, can you take this?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Text me when you get there? Look...
Sweetie, can you take this?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Text me when you get there? Look...<eos> I know that you are wrestling with something.
Yeah.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Text me when you get there? Look...<eos> I know that you are wrestling with something.<eos> And it's okay if you don't know how to talk about it.

Nan: Idon'twannaloseyou, too.<eos> Where are you?<eos> I'm here.<eos> Come on out.<eos> You couldn't even let us have her body buried properly.
God!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Sorry.<eos> You led me here.
I'm sorry.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Sorry.<eos> You led me here.<eos> Now you don't have the guts to show.
I'm so sorry.<eos> Sorry.<eos> You led me here.<eos> Now you don't have the guts to show.<eos> Some papa you are.
You led me here.<eos> Now you don't have the guts to show.<eos> Some papa you are.<eos> Pretty chilly out here?<eos> Got a fire goin' inside, if you wanna warm up.
We wouldn't want anyone to get hurt, now would we?<eos> I understand.<eos> It's confusing.<eos> We all do.<eos> You will do this on your terms and time.
You will do this on your terms and time.<eos> How about some introductions?<eos> I'm Elousia.<eos> I have a lot of names, but that's one of my favorites.<eos> Or, if you want, you can call me what nan does.
The "i am"?<eos> I am that I am.<eos> Look at that.<eos> Already quoting' scripture.<eos> And you've met my son.
Right.<eos> So...<eos> Which one of you is...<eos> I am.<eos> And you have no idea how much I love you.
Right.<eos> It's good to meet you guys.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Why'd I have to wake up?<eos> Think you dropped this.
I'll be right back.<eos> Why'd I have to wake up?<eos> Think you dropped this.<eos> You wrote this?<eos> We're so happy you accepted our invitation.
This is nuts.<eos> What am I doing here?<eos> What am I supposed to do?<eos> You're not supposed to do anything.<eos> You're free to do whatever you like.
What am I doing here?<eos> What am I supposed to do?<eos> You're not supposed to do anything.<eos> You're free to do whatever you like.<eos> You can go fishing.
Help sarayu in the garden.<eos> Or you can go talk to papa in the kitchen.<eos> Your choice.<eos> I know this is overwhelming, but you're gonna be all right, mack.<eos> I'll be finishing up a project in the workshop, if you wanna stop by.

Okay.<eos> You remember that smell?<eos> Ma griffe.<eos> Your mother's perfume.<eos> She loves you more than you can possibly know.
Your mother's perfume.<eos> She loves you more than you can possibly know.<eos> Am I dead?<eos> Do you feel dead?<eos> You knew I would come, didn't you?
You knew I would come, didn't you?<eos> Course I did.<eos> Was I free not to come?<eos> I'm not interested in prisoners.<eos> You're free to walk out that door right now.
Course I did.<eos> Was I free not to come?<eos> I'm not interested in prisoners.<eos> You're free to walk out that door right now.<eos> Why did you bring me back here?
I'm not interested in prisoners.<eos> You're free to walk out that door right now.<eos> Why did you bring me back here?<eos> Because here's where you got stuck.<eos> You're wearing a dress.
You're wearing a dress.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> I always pictured you with a white beard.<eos> I think that's Santa.<eos> After what you been through, i didn't think you could handle a father right now.
Fold back.<eos> Rotate.<eos> All there is to it.<eos> I know what a great Gulf there is between us, mack.<eos> You may not believe it, but I am especially fond of you.
There is no easy answer that'll take your pain away.<eos> No instant fix that's enduring.<eos> Life takes a bit of time and a lot of relationship.<eos> "Relationship"?<eos> You're the almighty god, right?

You know everything.<eos> You're everywhere, all at once.<eos> And you have limitless power.<eos> Yet, somehow you let my little girl die.<eos> When she needed you most, you abandoned her.
And you have limitless power.<eos> Yet, somehow you let my little girl die.<eos> When she needed you most, you abandoned her.<eos> I never left her.<eos> If you are who you say you are...
I never left her.<eos> If you are who you say you are...<eos> Where were you when I needed you?<eos> Son...<eos> When all you see is your pain, you lose sight of me.
Where were you when I needed you?<eos> Son...<eos> When all you see is your pain, you lose sight of me.<eos> Stop talking in riddles.<eos> How can you say that you will help me when you couldn't help her?
When all you see is your pain, you lose sight of me.<eos> Stop talking in riddles.<eos> How can you say that you will help me when you couldn't help her?<eos> Because of you, she's gone.<eos> Unless you can change that, I will never be free.
And the truth has a name.<eos> He's over in his woodshed right now, covered in sawdust.<eos> "Truth"?<eos> I know that story.<eos> You left him, too.
He's over in his woodshed right now, covered in sawdust.<eos> "Truth"?<eos> I know that story.<eos> You left him, too.<eos> Seems like you have a bad habit of turning your back on those you supposedly love.

I'm not who you think I am.<eos> He said it himself.<eos> "My god, my god, why hast thou forsaken me?"<eos> No, mack.<eos> You misunderstand the mystery.
Created to fly.<eos> You, on the other hand, were created to be loved.<eos> Living unloved is like clipping a bird's wings.<eos> Pain has a way of doing that to us.<eos> If it's left unresolved, you can forget what you were created for.

That's why you're here, MacKenzie.<eos> This is your flying lesson.<eos> Dinner's almost ready.<eos> So Josh has a girlfriend now?<eos> You mean ally?
Me, too. I'm especially fond of that laugh of hers.<eos> It's cute.<eos> Yeah.<eos> He's still having a hard time believing this is real.<eos> You think?
Thank you.<eos> Let me ask you somethin'.<eos> I've been tellin' you all about Josh and Kate and nan.<eos> But if you're real, then you already know everything I'm gonna say before I even say it, right?<eos> Yes, but we choose to listen to everything you have to say as if it was for the first time.
Yes, but we choose to listen to everything you have to say as if it was for the first time.<eos> We love getting to know your kids through your eyes.<eos> I'll wash, you dry?<eos> I'll take this round.<eos> Why don't you show mack some of your handiwork?
Incredible.<eos> I get that you're all connected.<eos> But I feel way more relaxed around you.<eos> That's probably because I'm human.<eos> But you're god, too, right?
The breath of life.<eos> She is my spirit.<eos> Love is meant to exist within a relationship, mack.<eos> That's all we wanna have with you.<eos> Even if you can't see it.
She is my spirit.<eos> Love is meant to exist within a relationship, mack.<eos> That's all we wanna have with you.<eos> Even if you can't see it.<eos> You are in the center of our love and purpose.
Missy!<eos> Daddy!<eos> Daddy!<eos> morning', mack.<eos> You like Neil young?
You like Neil young?<eos> I am especially fond of him.<eos> How'd you sleep, baby?<eos> Fine.<eos> You know, dreams are important.
How'd you sleep, baby?<eos> Fine.<eos> You know, dreams are important.<eos> They can be a way of opening' a window. Lettin' the bad air out.<eos> Is there anyone you're not especially fond of?
But what parent doesn't?<eos> And that's when your whole wrath thing comes in, right?<eos> My what?<eos> Your wrath.<eos> You lost me there.
My what?<eos> Your wrath.<eos> You lost me there.<eos> Come on.<eos> Everybody knows you punish the people who disappoint you.
Everybody knows you punish the people who disappoint you.<eos> Nope.<eos> I don't need to punish people.<eos> Sin is its own punishment.<eos> As difficult as it is for you to accept, I'm in the middle of everything you perceive to be a mess, workin' for your good.
I don't need to punish people.<eos> Sin is its own punishment.<eos> As difficult as it is for you to accept, I'm in the middle of everything you perceive to be a mess, workin' for your good.<eos> That's what I do.<eos> How can you say that?
As difficult as it is for you to accept, I'm in the middle of everything you perceive to be a mess, workin' for your good.<eos> That's what I do.<eos> How can you say that?<eos> After all the pain and suffering in the world, what possible good comes from a little girl being murdered by a sick monster?<eos> See, you may not cause those things, but you certainly don't stop 'em.

MacKenzie, you're trying to make sense of your world based on a very incomplete picture.<eos> It's like looking through the knothole of your pain.<eos> The real underlying flaw in your life is that you don't think that I'm good.<eos> I am!<eos> And if you knew me and how much I love you, then even when you don't understand, you could know that I am at work in your life for good.

And then you would trust me.<eos> Trust you?<eos> Why would I do that?<eos> My daughter is dead.<eos> And there's nothing you can say that will ever justify what happened to her.

You might need these though.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Just to be clear, we're not justifying anything.<eos> We'd like to heal it, if you'd let us.<eos> Before you go, there's something in the garden
We'd like to heal it, if you'd let us.<eos> Before you go, there's something in the garden<eos> I was hoping you could help me with. Before tomorrow's celebration.<eos> What celebration?<eos> If you wanna know, you'll stick around.
So beautiful.<eos> There's something very special I want to plant here tomorrow.<eos> To prepare the ground, we have to dig up all the roots, or they'll return and harm the new growth.<eos> But this is gorgeous.<eos> You can start over there.
Okay.<eos> Careful.<eos> That one's deadly.<eos> What's it doing here if it's poisonous?<eos> You're presuming that poison is bad.
What's it doing here if it's poisonous?<eos> You're presuming that poison is bad.<eos> On its own, the sap from this twig would kill you.<eos> But combine it with the nectar from this flower, and suddenly it contains incredible healing properties.<eos> Let me ask you, how confident are you in your ability to discern good from evil?
Well, if it helps me... Or the people that I love.<eos> And evil?<eos> It's harmful.<eos> If it hurts someone i care about.<eos> So, pretty much, you are the judge?
It's harmful.<eos> If it hurts someone i care about.<eos> So, pretty much, you are the judge?<eos> Yeah, I guess.<eos> You ever been wrong?
